Morning stiffness lasts approximately $60$ minutes. Pain improves with activity and worsens with rest.\n-   **Physical Examination:**\n    -   Dactylitis (\"sausage-like\") of the right $3$rd digit.\n    -   Enthesitis (tenderness at the Achilles insertion).\n    -   Nail abnormalities: Fine punctate depressions (pitting) and onycholysis.\n    -   Joint involvement: Distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints of both hands are tender and mildly swollen. Metacarpophalangeal joints are less involved.\n    -   Negative finding: No subcutaneous nodules.\n-   **Laboratory Studies:**\n    -   Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): $48$ mm/h.\n    -   C-reactive protein (CRP): $22$ mg/L.\n    -   Rheumatoid factor (RF): Negative.\n    -   Anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody: Negative.\n    -   Serum uric acid: $5.2$ mg/dL.\n-   **Radiographic Findings (Hand):**\n    -   Marginal erosions with adjacent periostitis.\n    -   Focal new bone formation at entheses.\n    -   \"Pencil-in-cup\" appearance at one DIP joint.\n-   **Provided Definitions:**\n    -   **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA):** A predominantly autoantibody-associated synovitis with pannus formation and a tendency for symmetric small-joint involvement that typically spares the DIP joints.\n    -   **Seronegative spondyloarthropathies (SpA):** Characterized by enthesitis, dactylitis, distal joint predominance, and association with psoriasis.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem presents a detailed clinical case study.\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The description of signs, symptoms, laboratory findings, and radiographic results is consistent with established medical and pathological knowledge of inflammatory arthritides. The definitions provided for rheumatoid arthritis and seronegative spondyloarthropathies are accurate and standard.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly stated, providing sufficient data to arrive at a logical diagnosis from the given options. The question asks for the most likely diagnosis, which is a standard task in clinical reasoning.\n-   **Objective:** The presentation uses precise, objective clinical language and quantitative data. Terms like \"sausage-like\" and \"pencil-in-cup\" are standard, descriptive terms in rheumatology and radiology.\n\nAll validation criteria are met. The problem is internally consistent, scientifically sound, and well-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe analysis aims to determine the most likely diagnosis by systematically comparing the patient's clinical presentation with the features of the diseases listed in the options, using the provided definitions as a foundation.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Clinical Features:**\n    *   **History of Psoriasis:** The patient has a $16$-year history of plaque psoriasis ($38$ years old now, onset at age $22$). This is a very strong risk factor for psoriatic arthritis (PsA), a type of seronegative spondyloarthropathy. The provided definition of SpA explicitly mentions an association with psoriasis.\n    *   **Pattern of Arthritis:** The arthritis is asymmetric (right $3$rd, then left $4$th finger) and predominantly involves the DIP joints. This pattern is characteristic of PsA. In contrast, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is typically symmetric and characteristically spares the DIP joints, as stated in the problem's definition.\n    *   **Dactylitis and Enthesitis:** The examination reveals a \"sausage-like\" digit (dactylitis) and tenderness at the Achilles insertion (enthesitis). Both are hallmark features of seronegative spondyloarthropathies, including PsA, and are explicitly mentioned in the provided definition of SpA. They are not typical features of RA.\n    *   **Nail Changes:** The presence of nail pitting and onycholysis is highly specific for psoriasis and is seen in a majority of patients with PsA. These are not associated with RA, gout, or osteoarthritis.\n    *   **Inflammatory Nature:** The morning stiffness of about $60$ minutes and the improvement of pain with activity confirm an inflammatory, rather than a degenerative (like osteoarthritis), process.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Laboratory Findings:**\n    *   **Inflammatory Markers:** The elevated ESR ($48$ mm/h) and CRP ($22$ mg/L) confirm an active systemic inflammatory state, which is expected in both inflammatory SpA and RA.\n    *   **Autoantibodies:** The negative RF and negative anti-CCP results are crucial. They make the diagnosis of RA highly unlikely, as RA is defined as a \"predominantly autoantibody-associated synovitis\". The absence of these autoantibodies classifies the condition as \"seronegative,\" which is the defining immunological characteristic of the spondyloarthropathy group.\n    *   **Uric Acid:** The serum uric acid level of $5.2$ mg/dL is within the normal range, arguing against a diagnosis of gout.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Radiographic Findings:**\n    *   **\"Pencil-in-cup\" Deformity:** This finding, resulting from severe erosion of a phalangeal head and reactive bone formation in the adjacent phalangeal base, is considered pathognomonic for psoriatic arthritis.\n    *   **Erosion and New Bone Formation:** The coexistence of marginal erosions (a destructive process) with periostitis and new bone formation (proliferative processes) is a classic radiographic sign of PsA and other spondyloarthropathies. RA, in contrast, is characterized primarily by erosions without significant bone proliferation.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation:** The patient's presentation aligns perfectly with the provided definition of a seronegative spondyloarthropathy and demonstrates a classic constellation of features for psoriatic arthritis: a history of psoriasis, asymmetric oligoarthritis with DIP involvement, dactylitis, enthesitis, nail changes, seronegativity for RF and anti-CCP, and pathognomonic radiographic findings.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Rheumatoid arthritis:** Incorrect. This diagnosis is contradicted by numerous findings: the arthritis is asymmetric and involves the DIP joints (RA is symmetric and spares DIPs), the patient is seronegative for both RF and anti-CCP (RA is typically autoantibody-positive), and there is clear evidence of dactylitis, enthesitis, and proliferative bone changes on X-ray, all of which are uncharacteristic of RA.\n\n**B. Psoriatic arthritis:** Correct. This diagnosis is supported by every piece of evidence presented: the prerequisite history of plaque psoriasis, the pattern of asymmetric DIP joint arthritis, the presence of dactylitis and enthesitis (hallmarks of SpA), the characteristic psoriatic nail changes, the seronegative lab profile, and the classic \"pencil-in-cup\" radiographic deformity. The presentation is a textbook case.\n\n**C. Reactive arthritis following a gastrointestinal infection:** Incorrect. While reactive arthritis is a type of seronegative spondyloarthropathy and shares features like enthesitis and asymmetric arthritis, there is no history given of a preceding infection. More importantly, the long-standing history of psoriasis, the psoriatic nail changes, and the \"pencil-in-cup\" deformity point much more specifically to psoriatic arthritis.\n\n**D. Gout with tophaceous involvement of the digits:** Incorrect. The serum uric acid level is normal ($5.2$ mg/dL). While this does not absolutely exclude gout, the overall clinical picture (inflammatory back pain pattern, dactylitis, enthesitis, nail pitting) and radiographic findings (\"pencil-in-cup\" deformity) are not typical for gout. Gouty erosions have a different \"punched-out\" appearance.\n\n**E. Erosive osteoarthritis:** Incorrect. While erosive osteoarthritis involves the DIP joints and is erosive, it is a degenerative disease with pain that typically worsens, not improves, with activity. It is not associated with the high levels of systemic inflammation (elevated ESR and CRP), dactylitis, enthesitis, or nail pitting seen in this patient. The \"pencil-in-cup\" deformity is not a feature of osteoarthritis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4447051"}, {"introduction": "Once RA is strongly suspected based on the overall clinical picture, the diagnosis should be formalized using standardized criteria that provide objectivity and consistency across clinical practice. The 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria serve as the modern standard for this purpose, assigning points for joint involvement, serology, inflammatory markers, and symptom duration. This exercise [@problem_id:4447055] provides a direct, hands-on opportunity to apply this scoring system, translating qualitative clinical findings into a quantitative score to determine if a patient meets the threshold for a definitive RA diagnosis.", "problem": "In the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification framework for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the disease is classified using a weighted, domain-based scoring system that aggregates evidence from joint involvement, serology, acute-phase reactants, and symptom duration. This approach is grounded in the principle that independent pathological domains contribute additive evidence toward classification. The foundational facts for this derivation are: (i) independent domains are aggregated linearly; (ii) each domain contributes a fixed number of points determined by validated criteria; and (iii) the total score is the sum of domain contributions.\n\nConsider a patient in whom the following domain-level findings have been established by standard clinical and laboratory methods:\n- Joint involvement: involvement of $10$ small joints, qualifying for the small-joint category.\n- Serology: high-positive anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody, defined per assay as above the high-positive threshold.\n- Acute-phase reactants: abnormal C-reactive protein (CRP).\n- Duration: symptom duration greater than $6$ weeks.\n\nUse the following empirically validated point allocations, which reflect the weighting of evidence in each domain:\n- Small-joint involvement at the level described above contributes $5$ points.\n- High-positive serology (anti-CCP or rheumatoid factor) contributes $3$ points.\n- Abnormal acute-phase reactants (CRP or erythrocyte sedimentation rate) contribute $1$ point.\n- Symptom duration greater than $6$ weeks contributes $1$ point.\n\nStarting from the principle that the total classification score is an additive aggregation of domain-specific contributions, construct a symbolic scoring function that maps these domain indicators to a total score, and then evaluate this function for the patient described.

It contains no contradictions or missing information. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe problem requires the construction of a symbolic scoring function and its evaluation for a specific case. The fundamental principle stated is that the total classification score is an additive aggregation of contributions from independent domains.\n\nLet the total score be denoted by the variable $S$. The four domains are joint involvement, serology, acute-phase reactants, and duration. We can define symbolic variables representing the points contributed by each domain:\n- $P_J$: Points for joint involvement.\n- $P_S$: Points for serology.\n- $P_A$: Points for acute-phase reactants.\n- $P_D$: Points for symptom duration.\n\nBased on the principle of linear, additive aggregation, the symbolic scoring function $S$ is the sum of the points from each domain. The function maps the set of points from the individual domains to a total score:\n$$S(P_J, P_S, P_A, P_D) = P_J + P_S + P_A + P_D$$\n\nNext, we must evaluate this function for the patient described by substituting the specific point values corresponding to the patient's clinical findings. The problem provides these values:\n\n1.  **Joint Involvement:** The patient has involvement of $10$ small joints. According to the provided criteria, this contributes $5$ points.\n    $$P_J = 5$$\n2.  **Serology:** The patient is high-positive for anti-CCP antibodies. This contributes $3$ points.\n    $$P_S = 3$$\n3.  **Acute-Phase Reactants:** The patient has an abnormal CRP. This contributes $1$ point.\n    $$P_A = 1$$\n4.  **Duration:** The symptom duration is greater than $6$ weeks. This contributes $1$ point.\n    $$P_D = 1$$\n\nSubstituting these numerical values into the symbolic scoring function yields the total score $S$ for this patient:\n$$S = 5 + 3 + 1 + 1$$\nPerforming the summation:\n$$S = 10$$\nThe total score for this patient, according to the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria as specified, is $10$. Within the context of the full classification system, a score of $6$ or greater is classified as definite rheumatoid arthritis.
