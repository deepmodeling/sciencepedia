The osmotic swelling pressure $\\Pi$ is proportional to the aggrecan concentration $A$: $\\Pi \\propto A$.\n2. The swelling ratio $S$ is proportional to the osmotic swelling pressure $\\Pi$: $S \\propto \\Pi$.\n\nFrom these two relationships, we can deduce the relationship between the swelling ratio $S$ and the aggrecan concentration $A$. If $S \\propto \\Pi$ and $\\Pi \\propto A$, then by transitivity of proportionality, $S \\propto A$.\nWe can express this relationship with a constant of proportionality, say $c$:\n$$\nS(t) = c A(t)\n$$\nThis constant $c$ is positive and assumed to be constant over the course of the degradation, as the problem states to use the given assumptions only.

Proceeding to solution derivation.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution involves a two-step calculation: first for the healthy (initial) state and second for the osteoarthritic (final) state.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Healthy State (State 0)**\n\nFirst, we determine the equilibrium properties for healthy cartilage using the given concentration $C_{0}$.\n\nThe concentration is given as $C_{0} = 300\\,\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$. The osmotic swelling pressure, $\\pi_{0}$, is calculated as:\n$$ \\pi_{0} = C_{0} R T = (300\\,\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}) \\times (8.314\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (310\\,\\text{K}) $$\n$$ \\pi_{0} = 773142\\,\\text{Pa} = 0.773142\\,\\text{MPa} $$\n\nAt equilibrium, this pressure is balanced by the collagen restoring stress:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{col},0} = \\pi_{0} $$\nUsing the expression for collagen stress, we can find the equilibrium hydration, $\\phi_{eq,0}$:\n$$ K(\\phi_{eq,0} - \\phi_{0}) = \\pi_{0} $$\n$$ \\phi_{eq,0} = \\phi_{0} + \\frac{\\pi_{0}}{K} = 0.70 + \\frac{0.773142\\,\\text{MPa}}{5.0\\,\\text{MPa}} $$\n$$ \\phi_{eq,0} = 0.70 + 0.1546284 = 0.8546284 \\approx 0.855 $$\n\nNow, we calculate the initial aggregate compressive modulus, $M_{0}$, using this hydration value:\n$$ M_{0} = M(\\phi_{eq,0}) = M_{b} + \\gamma(\\phi_{eq,0} - \\phi_{0}) $$\n$$ M_{0} = 0.50\\,\\text{MPa} + (4.0\\,\\text{MPa}) \\times (0.8546284 - 0.70) $$\n$$ M_{0} = 0.50\\,\\text{MPa} + (4.0\\,\\text{MPa}) \\times (0.1546284) $$\n$$ M_{0} = 0.50\\,\\text{MPa} + 0.6185136\\,\\text{MPa} = 1.1185136\\,\\text{MPa} \\approx 1.12\\,\\text{MPa} $$\nThe initial state is characterized by $\\phi \\approx 0.855$ and $M \\approx 1.12\\,\\text{MPa}$.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Osteoarthritic State (State 1)**\n\nIn the osteoarthritic state, the aggrecan concentration is reduced by $40\\%$:\n$$ C_{1} = (1 - 0.40)C_{0} = 0.60\\,C_{0} = 0.60 \\times 300\\,\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3} = 180\\,\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3} $$\n\nThe new osmotic pressure, $\\pi_{1}$, is:\n$$ \\pi_{1} = C_{1} R T = (180\\,\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}) \\times (8.314\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (310\\,\\text{K}) $$\n$$ \\pi_{1} = 463885.2\\,\\text{Pa} = 0.4638852\\,\\text{MPa} $$\nThis is, as expected, $60\\%$ of the healthy osmotic pressure: $0.60 \\times 0.773142\\,\\text{MPa} = 0.4638852\\,\\text{MPa}$.\n\nThe new equilibrium hydration, $\\phi_{eq,1}$, is found by balancing this new pressure:\n$$ K(\\phi_{eq,1} - \\phi_{0}) = \\pi_{1} $$\n$$ \\phi_{eq,1} = \\phi_{0} + \\frac{\\pi_{1}}{K} = 0.70 + \\frac{0.4638852\\,\\text{MPa}}{5.0\\,\\text{MPa}} $$\n$$ \\phi_{eq,1} = 0.70 + 0.09277704 = 0.79277704 \\approx 0.793 $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the new aggregate compressive modulus, $M_{1}$:\n$$ M_{1} = M(\\phi_{eq,1}) = M_{b} + \\gamma(\\phi_{eq,1} - \\phi_{0}) $$\n$$ M_{1} = 0.50\\,\\text{MPa} + (4.0\\,\\text{MPa}) \\times (0.79277704 - 0.70) $$\n$$ M_{1} = 0.50\\,\\text{MPa} + (4.0\\,\\text{MPa}) \\times (0.09277704) $$\n$$ M_{1} = 0.50\\,\\text{MPa} + 0.37110816\\,\\text{MPa} = 0.87110816\\,\\text{MPa} \\approx 0.87\\,\\text{MPa} $$\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation:**\nThe loss of $40\\%$ of aggrecan causes the equilibrium hydration to decrease from $\\phi \\approx 0.855$ to $\\phi \\approx 0.793$, and the aggregate compressive modulus to decrease from $M \\approx 1.12\\,\\text{MPa}$ to $M \\approx 0.87\\,\\text{MPa}$. The physical reason is that lower fixed charge density (aggrecan loss) reduces the osmotic swelling pressure, requiring less restoring stress from the collagen network. This new, lower-stress equilibrium occurs at a lower hydration level. Since the modulus is positively correlated with hydration in this model, the modulus also decreases, indicating a loss of mechanical function.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Loss of aggrecan reduces osmotic pressure, leading to reduced hydration from approximately $\\phi \\approx 0.855$ to $\\phi \\approx 0.793$, and a decreased compressive modulus from approximately $M \\approx 1.12\\,\\text{MPa}$ to $M \\approx 0.87\\,\\text{MPa}$, because lower fixed charge density diminishes swelling and pre-stress.**\nThe reasoning is physically sound: reduced aggrecan leads to lower osmotic pressure, causing dehydration and a reduction in the collagen network's balancing tension (pre-stress), which results in a lower tissue stiffness (modulus). The calculated values for initial hydration ($\\phi_{eq,0} \\approx 0.855$), final hydration ($\\phi_{eq,1} \\approx 0.793$), initial modulus ($M_{0} \\approx 1.12\\,\\text{MPa}$), and final modulus ($M_{1} \\approx 0.87\\,\\text{MPa}$) are all precisely confirmed by our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Loss of aggrecan reduces fixed charges, which increases hydration due to less electrostatic repulsion, but the compressive modulus decreases modestly to $M \\approx 0.98\\,\\text{MPa}$ because collagen dominates load-bearing.**\nThis option incorrectly states that hydration *increases*. The osmotic effect of drawing water in is the dominant phenomenon related to fixed charges in this context; losing them causes water loss. The calculated modulus value is also incorrect ($M_1 \\approx 0.87\\,\\text{MPa}$, not $0.98\\,\\text{MPa}$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Hydration decreases due to reduced osmotic pressure, but the compressive modulus increases to $M \\approx 1.30\\,\\text{MPa}$ because the collagen network bears more load as tissue dehydrates and tightens.**\nThis option correctly states that hydration decreases but incorrectly claims the modulus *increases*. The model equation $M(\\phi) = M_{b} + \\gamma(\\phi - \\phi_{0})$ with $\\gamma > 0$ shows that modulus decreases as hydration $\\phi$ decreases. The reasoning is also flawed; at the new, lower-hydration equilibrium, the collagen network is under *less* tension, not more.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Hydration and modulus change negligibly (less than $1\\%$) because the osmotic pressure is only on the order of $\\pi \\approx 0.001\\,\\text{MPa}$ at $C_{0} = 0.30\\,\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$, making collagen the dominant determinant of equilibrium hydration.**\nThe premise of this option is based on a calculation error. Our derivation shows the initial osmotic pressure is $\\pi_{0} \\approx 0.77\\,\\text{MPa}$, which is nearly three orders of magnitude larger than the claimed $0.001\\,\\text{MPa}$. Consequently, the changes are not negligible. The hydration decreases by approximately $(0.855 - 0.793)/0.855 \\approx 7.2\\%$, and the modulus decreases by approximately $(1.12 - 0.87)/1.12 \\approx 22.3\\%$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Reduced aggrecan lowers osmotic pressure, increasing hydration due to enhanced water influx, and increases the modulus to $M \\approx 1.20\\,\\text{MPa}$ because more water supports load through fluid pressurization.**\nThis option makes two fundamental errors. First, it incorrectly claims that lower osmotic pressure leads to *increased* hydration. Lower osmotic pressure implies a weaker gradient to draw water into the tissue, hence hydration decreases. Second, it incorrectly claims the modulus increases. The reasoning about fluid pressurization is relevant for dynamic loading, but this problem concerns the static equilibrium and the intrinsic aggregate modulus, which decreases with dehydration in this model.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4878408"}, {"introduction": "This final exercise brings our understanding of osteoarthritis into the clinical setting by focusing on a key biomechanical measurement: the Knee Adduction Moment (KAM).

The relationship between the normalized and absolute values is given by:\n$$ KAM_{norm} = \\frac{KAM_{abs}}{W \\times H} \\times 100\\% $$\nWe are given the following values:\n- $W = 900 \\text{ N}$\n- $H = 1.7 \\text{ m}$\n- $KAM_{norm} = 3\\% $\n\nTo find the absolute peak KAM, $KAM_{abs}$, we must rearrange the normalization equation:\n$$ KAM_{abs} = \\frac{KAM_{norm}}{100} \\times (W \\times H) $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this equation. The product of body weight and height serves as the normalization factor:\n$$ W \\times H = 900 \\text{ N} \\times 1.7 \\text{ m} = 1530 \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m} $$\nUsing this factor, we can calculate $KAM_{abs}$:\n$$ KAM_{abs} = \\frac{3}{100} \\times (1530 \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m}) $$\n$$ KAM_{abs} = 0.03 \\times 1530 \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m} $$\n$$ KAM_{abs} = 45.9 \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m} $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $45.9$. To express this with four significant figures, we add a trailing zero.\n$$ KAM_{abs} = 45.90 \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{45.90}$$", "id": "4878419"}]}
