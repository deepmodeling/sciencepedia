The rate constants for the forward binding, reverse dissociation, and catalytic (transport) steps are $k_{1}$, $k_{-1}$, and $k_{2}$, respectively.\n\nThe rate of change of the transporter-substrate complex concentration, $[ES]$, is given by its rate of formation minus its rate of breakdown:\n$$\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_{1}[E][S] - (k_{-1}[ES] + k_{2}[ES])$$\nThe steady-state approximation assumes that the concentration of the intermediate complex $[ES]$ remains constant over time, i.e., $\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = 0$. This is a valid assumption when the total transporter concentration is much lower than the substrate concentration and the system has reached a quasi-equilibrium.\n$$k_{1}[E][S] = (k_{-1} + k_{2})[ES]$$\nThe total concentration of the transporter, $[E]_{T}$, is the sum of the free transporter, $[E]$, and the bound transporter, $[ES]$:\n$$[E]_{T} = [E] + [ES]$$\nRearranging this gives an expression for the free transporter concentration:\n$$[E] = [E]_{T} - [ES]$$\nSubstituting this expression for $[E]$ into the steady-state equation:\n$$k_{1}([E]_{T} - [ES])[S] = (k_{-1} + k_{2})[ES]$$\nOur goal is to solve for $[ES]$ in terms of $[E]_{T}$, $[S]$, and the rate constants. Expanding the left side gives:\n$$k_{1}[E]_{T}[S] - k_{1}[ES][S] = (k_{-1} + k_{2})[ES]$$\nCollecting all terms involving $[ES]$ on one side:\n$$k_{1}[E]_{T}[S] = (k_{-1} + k_{2} + k_{1}[S])[ES]$$\nSolving for $[ES]$:\n$$[ES] = \\frac{k_{1}[E]_{T}[S]}{k_{-1} + k_{2} + k_{1}[S]}$$\nTo simplify, we divide the numerator and denominator by $k_{1}$:\n$$[ES] = \\frac{[E]_{T}[S]}{\\frac{k_{-1} + k_{2}}{k_{1}} + [S]}$$\nWe now define the Michaelis constant, $K_{m}$, as the collection of rate constants:\n$$K_{m} = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{2}}{k_{1}}$$\n$K_{m}$ represents the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of the maximum. Substituting $K_{m}$ into the equation for $[ES]$:\n$$[ES] = \\frac{[E]_{T}[S]}{K_{m} + [S]}$$\nThe uptake rate, denoted as $V$, is the rate of product formation, which is proportional to the concentration of the transporter-substrate complex:\n$$V = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{2}[ES]$$\nSubstituting the expression for $[ES]$ gives the rate as a function of substrate concentration:\n$$V = k_{2} \\frac{[E]_{T}[S]}{K_{m} + [S]}$$\nThe maximal uptake capacity, $V_{\\max}$, is achieved when the transporter is fully saturated with substrate, meaning $[ES] \\approx [E]_{T}$.

Their function is critically dependent on the electrochemical ion gradients across the cell membrane, which are themselves maintained by ATP-dependent pumps. Specifically, EAATs couple the inward transport of one glutamate anion to the co-transport of three sodium ions ($3\\,Na^+$) and one proton ($1\\,H^+$), and the counter-transport of one potassium ion ($1\\,K^+$). The steep downhill gradient for $Na^+$ provides the thermodynamic driving force for glutamate uptake against its concentration gradient.\n\nIn the ischemic penumbra, the primary event is the failure of energy metabolism due to insufficient oxygen and glucose, leading to a profound depletion of cellular ATP. This has a direct and catastrophic effect on the $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}/\\mathrm{K}^{+}$-ATPase pump, the primary consumer of ATP in the brain. Failure of this pump leads to the collapse of the transmembrane sodium and potassium gradients: intracellular $Na^+$ rises, and extracellular $K^+$ rises.\n\nThe failure of the $Na^+$ gradient cripples the EAATs. Without a strong driving force, the glutamate transport cycle slows dramatically or can even reverse, causing the transporters to release glutamate back into the extracellular space.\n\nThe derived saturation kinetics demonstrate that under normal conditions, with low extracellular glutamate ($[\\mathrm{Glu}]_{\\mathrm{e}} \\ll K_{m}$), the transporters operate far below saturation and can efficiently clear any excess glutamate. However, during ischemia, two things happen simultaneously: massive amounts of glutamate are released into the synapse (due to anoxic depolarization and reversal of transporters), and the clearance capacity of the EAATs plummets. The transporters that remain partially functional are immediately overwhelmed and saturated ($[\\mathrm{Glu}]_{\\mathrm{e}} \\gg K_{m}$), operating at their maximum possible rate, $V_{\\max}$. Crucially, this $V_{\\max}$ is itself severely reduced due to the bioenergetic failure. The result is a profound mismatch between glutamate release and uptake. This sustained high concentration of extracellular glutamate continuously activates NMDA and other glutamate receptors, leading to massive excitotoxic calcium influx and triggering the biochemical cascades that culminate in delayed neuronal death in the penumbra. The failure of EAATs is thus a key mechanism that links the initial metabolic insult to the prolongation of excitotoxic exposure and the expansion of the necrotic core.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.333}$$", "id": "4840557"}]}
