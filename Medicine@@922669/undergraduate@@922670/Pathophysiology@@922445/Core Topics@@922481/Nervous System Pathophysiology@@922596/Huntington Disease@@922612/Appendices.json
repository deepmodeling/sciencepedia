The number of repeats determines the clinical outcome. The classification of *HTT* alleles is as follows:\n- Normal alleles: Fewer than 27 CAG repeats.\n- Intermediate alleles: 27 to 35 CAG repeats. Individuals with these alleles do not develop the disease but have an increased risk of having children with an expanded, disease-causing allele.\n- Reduced-penetrance alleles: 36 to 39 CAG repeats. Individuals may or may not develop the symptoms of Huntington's disease in their lifetime.\n- Full-penetrance alleles: 40 or more CAG repeats. Individuals with these alleles will develop Huntington's disease, assuming they live a normal lifespan.\n\nA person undergoes genetic testing and is found to be heterozygous for the *HTT* gene, with one allele having 15 CAG repeats and the other having 42 CAG repeats.

Denote the full-penetrance allele as $F$ (42 repeats) and the normal allele as $N$ (15 repeats), so the genotype is $N/F$. The partner has two normal alleles with 18 and 23 repeats, which we denote collectively as normal alleles $N$, so the partner’s genotype is $N/N$.\n\nUnder simple Mendelian inheritance with stable repeat numbers and equal segregation, each parent contributes one allele to the child with equal probability from their two alleles.

The concept of penetrance—the likelihood that a given genotype will result in a disease phenotype—can be elegantly captured with a mathematical model. This exercise [@problem_id:4793468] uses a logistic function to explore how penetrance changes dramatically around a specific repeat length, providing a quantitative basis for the clinical distinction between reduced- and full-penetrance alleles.", "problem": "Huntington disease is caused by an expanded cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide repeat in the huntingtin gene, with the number of repeats $L$ correlating with disease risk and age of onset. In pathophysiology, penetrance is the probability that an individual with a disease-associated genotype expresses the disease phenotype. Starting from the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, where deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is transcribed to ribonucleic acid (RNA) and translated to protein, the expanded CAG tract results in a polyglutamine stretch in the huntingtin protein that perturbs neuronal function and survival. Empirically, the relationship between the repeat length $L$ and penetrance can be well approximated by a sigmoidal function that captures a threshold-like transition and saturating behavior as mutant huntingtin toxicity overwhelms cellular resilience mechanisms.\n\nConsider a hypothetical logistic penetrance model defined by the function\n$$\nP(L)=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp\\!\\big(-k\\,(L-L_0)\\big)},\n$$\nwhere $P(L)$ is the penetrance as a function of CAG repeat length $L$, $k$ is a steepness parameter, and $L_0$ is the inflection point representing the threshold repeat length.

We are tasked to compute the penetrance for $L = 38$, $L = 41$, and $L = 45$.\n\nFirst, we substitute the given parameters $k$ and $L_0$ into the model equation:\n$$\nP(L) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-0.5(L - 40))}\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the penetrance, $P(L)$, for each specified value of $L$.\n\nCase 1: $L = 38$\n$$\nP(38) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-0.5(38 - 40))}\n$$\n$$\nP(38) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-0.5(-2))}\n$$\n$$\nP(38) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(1)}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\exp(1) \\approx 2.71828$, we get:\n$$\nP(38) \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 2.71828} = \\frac{1}{3.71828} \\approx 0.2689414\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we obtain $P(38) = 0.2689$.\n\nCase 2: $L = 41$\n$$\nP(41) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-0.5(41 - 40))}\n$$\n$$\nP(41) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-0.5(1))}\n$$\n$$\nP(41) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-0.5)}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\exp(-0.5) \\approx 0.60653$, we get:\n$$\nP(41) \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 0.60653} = \\frac{1}{1.60653} \\approx 0.6224593\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we obtain $P(41) = 0.6225$.\n\nCase 3: $L = 45$\n$$\nP(45) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-0.5(45 - 40))}\n$$\n$$\nP(45) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-0.5(5))}\n$$\n$$\nP(45) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-2.5)}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\exp(-2.5) \\approx 0.082085$, we get:\n$$\nP(45) \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 0.082085} = \\frac{1}{1.082085} \\approx 0.9241418\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we obtain $P(45) = 0.9241$.\n\nBiological Interpretation:\nThe calculated penetrance values, $P(38) = 0.2689$, $P(41) = 0.6225$, and $P(45) = 0.9241$, illustrate the key pathophysiological features of Huntington disease risk as a function of CAG repeat length.\n\nThe model is centered around a threshold length $L_0 = 40$. For a repeat length of $L = 38$, which is below this threshold, the penetrance is relatively low ($P \\approx 27\\%$). This corresponds to the clinically observed \"reduced penetrance\" range, where an individual carrying the mutation has a substantial chance of not developing the disease phenotype within a typical lifespan. Pathophysiologically, this suggests that at this repeat length, cellular quality control mechanisms, such as protein folding chaperones and the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system, can still manage the burden of the misfolding-prone mutant huntingtin protein to some extent, preventing or delaying the onset of widespread neuronal dysfunction.\n\nFor a repeat length of $L = 41$, just one repeat unit above the threshold $L_0$, the penetrance increases sharply to $P \\approx 62\\%$. This steep rise is a characteristic feature of the sigmoidal model around its inflection point and accurately reflects the biological reality. A small increment in the length of the polyglutamine tract beyond a critical point leads to a dramatic increase in its propensity to aggregate and exert toxic effects, rapidly overwhelming cellular resilience. This demonstrates the threshold-like nature of the disease's onset.\n\nAt a repeat length of $L = 45$, well above the threshold, the penetrance is very high, $P \\approx 92\\%$, approaching full penetrance. This models the \"full penetrance\" allele range, where the development of the disease is almost certain. The high repeat number produces a severely toxic mutant protein that cellular defense mechanisms can no longer contain. This leads to inexorable neuronal damage and the manifestation of the disease phenotype. The saturating behavior of the logistic function for high $L$ reflects this ceiling effect, where risk cannot exceed $100\\%$.\n\nIn summary, the progression from $P(38)$ to $P(45)$ quantitatively captures the transition from incomplete to virtually complete disease penetrance as the CAG repeat length crosses and exceeds a critical pathogenic threshold, a hallmark of the pathophysiology of Huntington disease.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.2689 & 0.6225 & 0.9241 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4793468"}, {"introduction": "To connect the genetic cause of Huntington's disease to its clinical symptoms, we must look at the level of brain circuits.

Early in Huntington disease, selective vulnerability and dysfunction of D2 medium spiny neurons reduces indirect pathway activity. Consider the following linear model of net thalamic output:\n$$T=\\alpha D_{1}-\\beta D_{2},$$\nwhere $T$ is a dimensionless index of net thalamic drive to cortex, $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ are dimensionless measures of direct and indirect pathway activities, and $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are positive weighting parameters reflecting pathway gain.

The calculated change is $\\Delta T = 0.4000$, which is a positive value. This indicates that the net thalamic drive to the cortex ($T$) has increased in the early HD state compared to the baseline state. The problem states that the direct pathway facilitates thalamocortical excitation, and the overall circuit is involved in motor control. Increased thalamic excitation of the motor cortex is known to promote movement. A pathological increase in this drive leads to excessive and involuntary movements, which are classified as hyperkinetic symptoms. Therefore, the positive sign of $\\Delta T$ predicts a shift toward hyperkinetic motor features, which is consistent with the chorea characteristic of early-stage Huntington disease.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.4000}\n$$", "id": "4793493"}]}
