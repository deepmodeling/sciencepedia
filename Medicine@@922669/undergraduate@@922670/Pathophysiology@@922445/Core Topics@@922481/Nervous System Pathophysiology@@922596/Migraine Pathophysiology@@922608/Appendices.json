Consider a meningeal nociceptor at rest in physiological extracellular potassium concentration and normal intracellular potassium concentration, with no synaptic input. You may assume the following fundamental bases: the membrane potential is determined by relative ion permeabilities as captured qualitatively by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz framework, the Nernst potential for potassium $E_{K}$ is negative relative to zero due to higher intracellular than extracellular potassium concentration, total membrane conductance $G_{\\text{total}}$ is the sum of individual channel conductances, input resistance $R_{\\text{in}}$ satisfies $R_{\\text{in}} = 1 / G_{\\text{total}}$, and Ohm’s law relates membrane voltage change to injected current by $\\Delta V = I \\cdot R_{\\text{in}}$.

Membrane potential ($V_{m}$) is determined by relative ion permeabilities as described by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) framework.\n    2.  The Nernst potential for potassium ($E_{K}$) is negative. This is due to $[K^+]_{\\text{in}} > [K^+]_{\\text{out}}$.\n    3.  Total membrane conductance ($G_{\\text{total}}$) is the sum of individual channel conductances.\n    4.  Input resistance ($R_{\\text{in}}$) is the reciprocal of total conductance: $R_{\\text{in}} = 1 / G_{\\text{total}}$.\n    5.  Ohm's law applies to membrane voltage changes: $\\Delta V = I \\cdot R_{\\text{in}}$, where $I$ is an injected current.\n- **Stimulus Mechanisms:**\n    1.  Mechanical stimuli open mechanosensitive channels, producing an inward current $I_{\\text{mech}}$.\n    2.  Pro-inflammatory chemical stimuli open or potentiate depolarizing transduction channels, producing an inward current $I_{\\text{chem}}$.\n- **Question:** Predict the direction of change for: resting membrane potential ($V_{m}$), input resistance ($R_{\\text{in}}$), and responsiveness to mechanical and chemical stimuli.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of cellular electrophysiology. The role of TRESK channels (encoded by `KCNK18`) in nociceptor excitability and migraine pathophysiology is a well-documented area of contemporary neuroscience research. The provided assumptions (GHK framework, Nernst potential, Ohm's law for membranes) are foundational to the field.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It specifies a clear perturbation (a reduction in a specific potassium conductance) and asks for the resulting qualitative changes in key electrophysiological properties ($V_{m}$, $R_{\\text{in}}$, responsiveness). The provided principles are sufficient to deduce a unique qualitative answer.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and scientific language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the enumerated flaws (e.g., scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, etc.). It represents a standard, albeit complex, application of biophysical principles to a pathophysiological scenario.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived based on the provided principles.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe problem requires a systematic analysis of how a reduction in background potassium leak conductance affects the electrophysiological properties of a nociceptor.\n\n1.  **Effect on Resting Membrane Potential ($V_{m}$):**\n    The resting membrane potential ($V_{m}$) is established by the net flow of ions across the membrane, primarily $K^+$, $Na^+$, and $Cl^-$. In a typical neuron at rest, the membrane is most permeable to $K^+$. Consequently, $V_m$ lies close to the Nernst potential for potassium, $E_{K}$, which is given to be negative. The GHK equation provides a more general description, where $V_m$ is a weighted average of the Nernst potentials of the permeable ions, with the weights being their relative permeabilities (or conductances).\n    Let's represent the resting state using a simplified GHK-like model focused on conductances:\n    $$V_{m} \\approx \\frac{G_{K}E_{K} + G_{Na}E_{Na} + G_{Cl}E_{Cl}}{G_{K} + G_{Na} + G_{Cl}}$$\n    where $G_i$ is the conductance for ion $i$ and $E_i$ is its Nernst potential. For a typical neuron, $E_K$ is strongly negative (around $-90 \\text{ mV}$), and $E_{Na}$ is strongly positive (around $+60 \\text{ mV}$), with $G_K \\gg G_{Na}$ at rest.\n    The problem states that the loss-of-function variant in `KCNK18`/`TRESK` reduces the background potassium leak conductance. This means $G_K$ decreases. As $G_K$ decreases, its contribution to the weighted average that determines $V_m$ diminishes. The relative contribution of other conductances, particularly the depolarizing sodium conductance $G_{Na}$, increases. As a result, $V_m$ will shift away from the negative $E_K$ and move towards the positive $E_{Na}$. This constitutes a **depolarization**, meaning $V_{m}$ becomes less negative.\n\n2.  **Effect on Input Resistance ($R_{\\text{in}}$):**\n    Input resistance is defined as the reciprocal of the total membrane conductance: $R_{\\text{in}} = 1 / G_{\\text{total}}$. The total conductance is the sum of all individual ion conductances: $G_{\\text{total}} = G_K + G_{Na} + G_{Cl} + \\dots$.\n    The `TRESK` channel is a background leak channel, meaning it is open at rest and contributes significantly to the resting total conductance $G_{\\text{total}}$. A loss-of-function mutation reduces this specific potassium conductance, a component of the overall $G_K$. This directly leads to a decrease in $G_{\\text{total}}$.\n    Since $R_{\\text{in}}$ is inversely proportional to $G_{\\text{total}}$, a decrease in $G_{\\text{total}}$ will cause an **increase** in $R_{\\text{in}}$.\n\n3.  **Effect on Responsiveness to Stimuli:**\n    Responsiveness, or excitability, can be assessed in two ways: the magnitude of the voltage change for a given stimulus, and the proximity of the resting potential to the action potential threshold. Both are affected by the mutation.\n    *   **Voltage Change per Stimulus Current:** The problem states that both mechanical ($I_{\\text{mech}}$) and chemical ($I_{\\text{chem}}$) stimuli generate inward (depolarizing) currents. Ohm's law, as given, relates this current to the resulting change in membrane potential: $\\Delta V = I_{\\text{stimulus}} \\cdot R_{\\text{in}}$. Since we have determined that $R_{\\text{in}}$ increases, for any given stimulus current $I_{\\text{stimulus}}$, the resulting depolarization $\\Delta V$ will be larger.\n    *   **Proximity to Threshold:** We have also determined that the resting membrane potential $V_m$ is depolarized (less negative). This means the cell is already closer to the voltage threshold required to initiate an action potential.\n    \n    Combining these two effects—a larger depolarization ($\\Delta V$) from a more depolarized starting point ($V_m$)—means that a smaller stimulus will be sufficient to bring the neuron to its firing threshold. Therefore, the responsiveness of the nociceptor to both mechanical and pro-inflammatory chemical stimuli **increases**.\n\n**Summary of Predictions:**\n- $V_{m}$: Depolarizes (becomes less negative).\n- $R_{\\text{in}}$: Increases.\n- Responsiveness to both stimuli: Increases.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n- **A. $V_{m}$ depolarizes (becomes less negative), $R_{\\text{in}}$ increases, and responsiveness to both mechanical and pro-inflammatory chemical stimuli increases.**\nThis option perfectly matches all three predictions derived from first principles. The decreased potassium leak causes depolarization and increases input resistance, both of which contribute to heightened excitability in response to any depolarizing input current. **Correct**.\n\n- **B. $V_{m}$ hyperpolarizes (becomes more negative), $R_{\\text{in}}$ decreases, and responsiveness to both mechanical and pro-inflammatory chemical stimuli decreases.**\nThis option presents the exact opposite of the derived effects for all three parameters. A loss-of-function in a potassium channel cannot cause hyperpolarization or increased conductance. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **C. $V_{m}$ depolarizes, $R_{\\text{in}}$ decreases, and responsiveness to pro-inflammatory chemical stimuli increases while responsiveness to mechanical stimuli is unchanged.**\nThis option correctly identifies depolarization but incorrectly states that $R_{\\text{in}}$ decreases. A loss of a conductive pathway must increase resistance. It also baselessly proposes a differential effect on responsiveness which is not supported by the problem's framework, where both stimuli produce inward currents governed by the same $R_{\\text{in}}$. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. $V_{m}$ remains unchanged due to compensatory conductances, $R_{\\text{in}}$ increases, and responsiveness increases for mechanical stimuli but decreases for pro-inflammatory chemical stimuli.**\nThis option incorrectly assumes $V_{m}$ remains unchanged; the problem asks for the direct effect of the conductance loss, not long-term compensation, and the GHK principle predicts a change. It also proposes an unsubstantiated differential effect on responsiveness. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **E. $V_{m}$ depolarizes, $R_{\\text{in}}$ increases, mechanical responsiveness increases, but responsiveness to pro-inflammatory chemical stimuli decreases due to inactivation of voltage-gated calcium channels.**\nThis option correctly identifies the changes in $V_m$ and $R_{\\text{in}}$. However, it invokes a speculative secondary mechanism (inactivation of voltage-gated calcium channels) to argue for decreased chemical responsiveness. This mechanism is not mentioned in the problem statement's assumptions. The direct and primary effect described by Ohm's law ($\\Delta V = I \\cdot R_{\\text{in}}$) for any inward current is an increased voltage response. Thus, responsiveness should increase, not decrease. This option introduces an unstated complexity that contradicts the most direct conclusion from the givens. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4807530"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of excitability, this practice delves into the quantitative biophysics of a key event in migraine aura: cortical spreading depolarization (CSD).

It is therefore **VALID**. I will proceed with a full and reasoned solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution\n\nThe membrane potential, $V_m$, is described by the Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz (GHK) voltage equation. For a membrane permeable to potassium ($K^+$), sodium ($Na^+$), and chloride ($Cl^-$) ions, the equation is:\n$$ V_m = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{P_K[K^+]_o + P_{Na}[Na^+]_o + P_{Cl}[Cl^-]_i}{P_K[K^+]_i + P_{Na}[Na^+]_i + P_{Cl}[Cl^-]_o} \\right) $$\nHere, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $P_x$ represents the relative permeability of ion $x$, and $[x]_o$ and $[x]_i$ are the extracellular and intracellular concentrations of ion $x$, respectively. Note that for the anion $Cl^-$, the intracellular and extracellular concentrations are inverted in the fraction, reflecting its negative charge.\n\nWe are asked to compute the change in membrane potential, $\\Delta V_m$, when the extracellular potassium concentration, $[K^+]_o$, changes from an initial value, $[K^+]_{o,1}$, to a final value, $[K^+]_{o,2}$. All other parameters are held constant.\n\nLet $V_{m,1}$ be the initial membrane potential with $[K^+]_o = [K^+]_{o,1} = 3\\ \\mathrm{mM}$, and $V_{m,2}$ be the final membrane potential with $[K^+]_o = [K^+]_{o,2} = 10\\ \\mathrm{mM}$.\n\nThe initial membrane potential is:\n$$ V_{m,1} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{P_K[K^+]_{o,1} + P_{Na}[Na^+]_o + P_{Cl}[Cl^-]_i}{P_K[K^+]_i + P_{Na}[Na^+]_i + P_{Cl}[Cl^-]_o} \\right) $$\n\nThe final membrane potential is:\n$$ V_{m,2} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{P_K[K^+]_{o,2} + P_{Na}[Na^+]_o + P_{Cl}[Cl^-]_i}{P_K[K^+]_i + P_{Na}[Na^+]_i + P_{Cl}[Cl^-]_o} \\right) $$\n\nThe change in membrane potential is $\\Delta V_m = V_{m,2} - V_{m,1}$.\n$$ \\Delta V_m = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{P_K[K^+]_{o,2} + P_{Na}[Na^+]_o + P_{Cl}[Cl^-]_i}{P_K[K^+]_i + P_{Na}[Na^+]_i + P_{Cl}[Cl^-]_o} \\right) - \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{P_K[K^+]_{o,1} + P_{Na}[Na^+]_o + P_{Cl}[Cl^-]_i}{P_K[K^+]_i + P_{Na}[Na^+]_i + P_{Cl}[Cl^-]_o} \\right) $$\nUsing the logarithmic property $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, we can simplify the expression.

Let's define the numerator of the GHK argument for the initial and final states as $N_1$ and $N_2$, respectively.\n$N_1 = P_K[K^+]_{o,1} + P_{Na}[Na^+]_o + P_{Cl}[Cl^-]_i$\n$N_2 = P_K[K^+]_{o,2} + P_{Na}[Na^+]_o + P_{Cl}[Cl^-]_i$\n\nSo, $\\Delta V_m = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_2}{N_1}\\right)$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the pre-factor $\\frac{RT}{F}$ in units of Volts:\n$$ \\frac{RT}{F} = \\frac{(8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}) (310\\ \\mathrm{K})}{96485.33212\\ \\mathrm{C\\ mol^{-1}}} \\approx 0.0267145\\ \\mathrm{V} $$\n\nNext, we calculate $N_1$ and $N_2$.

The problem specifies that the gepant is a reversible and competitive antagonist. For a competitive antagonist, the mechanism of action is direct competition with the endogenous agonist for the same binding site on the receptor. The antagonist's affinity for the receptor is quantified by its own equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$. The inhibitory constant, $K_i$, for a pure competitive antagonist is, by definition, equivalent to its $K_d$. Thus, the substitution is valid, and we can use $K_d = K_i = 1$ nM.\n\nThe third step is to compute the receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, for the given drug concentrations, $C = 5$ $\\mathrm{nM}$ and $C = 50$ $\\mathrm{nM}$. We are told to assume that the free ligand concentration $[L]$ is equal to the steady-state plasma concentration $C$.\nUsing the derived equation with $K_d = K_i = 1$ $\\mathrm{nM}$:\n\nFor $C_1 = 5$ $\\mathrm{nM}$:\n$$\\theta_1 = \\frac{C_1}{K_i + C_1} = \\frac{5~\\mathrm{nM}}{1~\\mathrm{nM} + 5~\\mathrm{nM}} = \\frac{5}{6}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\theta_1 \\approx 0.8333$.\n\nFor $C_2 = 50$ $\\mathrm{nM}$:\n$$\\theta_2 = \\frac{C_2}{K_i + C_2} = \\frac{50~\\mathrm{nM}}{1~\\mathrm{nM} + 50~\\mathrm{nM}} = \\frac{50}{51}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\theta_2 \\approx 0.9804$.\n\nThe fourth step is to demonstrate that fractional inhibition of signaling equals fractional receptor occupancy under the given assumptions. We are given the conditions of \"no spare receptors\" and \"linear transduction\". This implies that the maximum physiological response (signal) is directly proportional to the number of receptors activated by the agonist (CGRP).\nLet $S_{max}$ be the maximum signal achievable, which occurs when all receptors, $[R_T]$, are bound by the agonist. Thus, $S_{max} \\propto [R_T]$.\nIn the presence of the competitive antagonist at concentration $[L]$, a fraction $\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R_T]}$ of the receptors are occupied and thus unavailable to the agonist. The number of receptors available for agonist binding is reduced to $[R_{available}] = [R_T] - [RL]$.\nThe new, lower maximum signal, $S'_{max}$, achievable in the presence of the antagonist is proportional to this reduced number of available receptors: $S'_{max} \\propto [R_T] - [RL]$.\n\nFractional inhibition ($FI$) is defined as the fractional reduction in the maximum possible signal:\n$$FI = \\frac{S_{max} - S'_{max}}{S_{max}}$$\nSubstituting the proportionalities (the proportionality constant cancels):\n$$FI = \\frac{[R_T] - ([R_T] - [RL])}{[R_T]} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R_T]}$$\nSince $\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R_T]}$, it follows directly that:\n$$FI = \\theta$$\nTherefore, under the simplifying assumptions of the problem, the fractional inhibition of CGRP signaling is equal to the fractional occupancy of the CGRP receptor by the gepant.\n\nThis means the values for fractional inhibition are numerically identical to the values for receptor occupancy.\nFractional inhibition at $C_1 = 5$ $\\mathrm{nM}$ is $FI_1 = \\theta_1 \\approx 0.8333$.\nFractional inhibition at $C_2 = 50$ $\\mathrm{nM}$ is $FI_2 = \\theta_2 \\approx 0.9804$.\n\nThe final answer consists of these four values presented in a single row matrix in the specified order: $\\theta(5$ $\\mathrm{nM})$, $\\theta(50$ $\\mathrm{nM})$, $FI(5$ $\\mathrm{nM})$, $FI(50$ $\\mathrm{nM})$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.8333 & 0.9804 & 0.8333 & 0.9804 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4807513"}]}
