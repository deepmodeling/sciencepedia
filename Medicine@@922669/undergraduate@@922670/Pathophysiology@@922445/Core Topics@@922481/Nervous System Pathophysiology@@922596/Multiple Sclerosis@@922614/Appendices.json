It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem that can be solved with the provided information. We may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the prolongation in VEP latency, which we will denote as $\\Delta t$. This prolongation is the difference in the total conduction time along the optic pathway between a case with a demyelinated segment and a completely healthy (intact) case.\n\nLet $t_{demyelinated}$ be the total conduction time in the axon with the lesion, and $t_{intact}$ be the total conduction time in the healthy axon without a lesion. The prolongation is given by:\n$$ \\Delta t = t_{demyelinated} - t_{intact} $$\nThe problem states that the only effect on latency is the change in axonal conduction time through the focal lesion of length $L$. This means that the conduction time through the rest of the axon, as well as any synaptic and cortical processing delays, are identical in both scenarios. Therefore, they cancel out when we take the difference.\n\nThe prolongation $\\Delta t$ is simply the difference in time it takes for an action potential to traverse the segment of length $L$ in the two conditions.\nLet $t_{L,d}$ be the time to travel the distance $L$ with the demyelinated velocity $v_d$.\nLet $t_{L,0}$ be the time to travel the distance $L$ with the healthy velocity $v_0$.\n\nFrom the fundamental definition of velocity, $v = \\frac{d}{t}$, we can express time as $t = \\frac{d}{v}$.\nApplying this to our segment of length $L$:\n$$ t_{L,d} = \\frac{L}{v_d} $$\n$$ t_{L,0} = \\frac{L}{v_0} $$\nThe prolongation in latency is the difference between these two times:\n$$ \\Delta t = t_{L,d} - t_{L,0} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the times, we get the analytical formula for the prolongation:\n$$ \\Delta t = \\frac{L}{v_d} - \\frac{L}{v_0} $$\nThis can be written in factored form:\n$$ \\Delta t = L \\left( \\frac{1}{v_d} - \\frac{1}{v_0} \\right) $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided in the problem statement:\n- $L = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $v_d = 5\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $v_0 = 30\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n$$ \\Delta t = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{m} \\left( \\frac{1}{5\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} - \\frac{1}{30\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\right) $$\nFirst, we evaluate the terms inside the parentheses.

Validate Using Extracted Givens:**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on well-established principles of neurophysiology, including the roles of myelination, nodes of Ranvier, membrane capacitance, and ion pumps (Na$^+$/K$^+$ ATPase) in action potential propagation and metabolic cost. The values provided for cellular dimensions, membrane properties, and electrical potentials are physiologically realistic.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined and asks for a dimensionless ratio (a fold-increase). The given information is sufficient to establish a relationship between the geometric properties of the axon and the total charge movement, which is proportional to the ATP cost. A unique solution can be derived.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms, free of subjective or ambiguous language.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem provides all necessary physical quantities and relationships. The units are consistent and can be converted to a common standard (e.g., SI). For instance, $L = 0.02 \\,\\mathrm{m}$, $a = 5 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\ell_{\\mathrm{node}} = 1 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\ell_{\\mathrm{internode}} = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{m}$, $c_u = 10^{-2} \\,\\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{m}^2$, $\\Delta V = 0.1 \\,\\mathrm{V}$. The setup is internally consistent.\n\n**1.3. Verdict and Action:**\nThe problem is valid. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Step 2: Solution\n\nThe problem asks for the fold-increase in ATP molecules required for an action potential. Let $N_{\\mathrm{ATP, myelinated}}$ and $N_{\\mathrm{ATP, demyelinated}}$ be the number of ATP molecules consumed in the myelinated and demyelinated states, respectively. The fold-increase is their ratio.\n\nThe problem states that the ATP cost is proportional to the total sodium charge, $Q_{\\mathrm{Na}^+}$, that enters the cell during the action potential. The stoichiometry of the Na$^+$/K$^+$ ATPase states that $3$ sodium ions are pumped out for every ATP molecule consumed. If $e$ is the elementary charge, the number of sodium ions is $N_{\\mathrm{Na}^+} = Q_{\\mathrm{Na}^+}/e$, and the number of ATP molecules is $N_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = N_{\\mathrm{Na}^+}/3 = Q_{\\mathrm{Na}^+}/(3e)$. Therefore, $N_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$ is directly proportional to $Q_{\\mathrm{Na}^+}$.\n\nIn cable theory, the amount of ionic charge that must cross the membrane to produce a voltage change $\\Delta V$ is equal to the capacitive charge $Q_C = C \\cdot \\Delta V$, where $C$ is the capacitance of the active membrane area. We thus assume $Q_{\\mathrm{Na}^+} \\propto Q_C$.\n\nThe fold-increase in ATP cost is therefore:\n$$ \\text{Fold-increase} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{ATP, demyelinated}}}{N_{\\mathrm{ATP, myelinated}}} = \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{Na}^+, \\text{demyelinated}}}{Q_{\\mathrm{Na}^+, \\text{myelinated}}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{demyelinated}} \\cdot \\Delta V}{C_{\\mathrm{myelinated}} \\cdot \\Delta V} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{demyelinated}}}{C_{\\mathrm{myelinated}}} $$\nThe capacitance $C$ of a membrane is the product of its capacitance per unit area, $c_u$, and its surface area, $A$. Hence, $C = c_u \\cdot A$. The ratio of capacitances becomes a ratio of the active surface areas:\n$$ \\text{Fold-increase} = \\frac{c_u \\cdot A_{\\mathrm{demyelinated}}}{c_u \\cdot A_{\\mathrm{myelinated}}} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{demyelinated}}}{A_{\\mathrm{myelinated}}} $$\nOur task reduces to calculating the active membrane area in each case. The axon is a cylinder of radius $a$.\n\n**1. Area in the Demyelinated State ($A_{\\mathrm{demyelinated}}$)**\nIn the demyelinated state, the entire axon segment of length $L$ is active. The surface area of this cylinder is:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{demyelinated}} = (2 \\pi a) L $$\n\n**2. Area in the Myelinated State ($A_{\\mathrm{myelinated}}$)**\nIn the myelinated state, only the nodes of Ranvier are active. The total active area is the area of a single node, $A_{\\mathrm{node}}$, multiplied by the number of nodes, $N_{\\mathrm{nodes}}$, within the segment of length $L$.\nThe area of a single node of length $\\ell_{\\mathrm{node}}$ is:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{node}} = (2 \\pi a) \\ell_{\\mathrm{node}} $$\nThe number of nodes in a length $L$ is determined by the internode spacing $\\ell_{\\mathrm{internode}}$. A standard simplifying assumption in this context, valid for a long axon ($L \\gg \\ell_{\\mathrm{internode}}$), is to consider the density of nodes, which is $1/\\ell_{\\mathrm{internode}}$. The total number of nodes is then:\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{nodes}} = \\frac{L}{\\ell_{\\mathrm{internode}}} $$\nThe total active area in the myelinated axon is:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{myelinated}} = N_{\\mathrm{nodes}} \\cdot A_{\\mathrm{node}} = \\left(\\frac{L}{\\ell_{\\mathrm{internode}}}\\right) (2 \\pi a) \\ell_{\\mathrm{node}} $$\n\n**3. Compute the Fold-Increase**\nWe now compute the ratio of the two areas:\n$$ \\text{Fold-increase} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{demyelinated}}}{A_{\\mathrm{myelinated}}} = \\frac{(2 \\pi a) L}{\\left(\\frac{L}{\\ell_{\\mathrm{internode}}}\\right) (2 \\pi a) \\ell_{\\mathrm{node}}} $$\nThe terms $2 \\pi a$ and $L$ cancel out, leading to a remarkably simple result that depends only on the axon's myelination geometry:\n$$ \\text{Fold-increase} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\ell_{\\mathrm{node}}}{\\ell_{\\mathrm{internode}}}} = \\frac{\\ell_{\\mathrm{internode}}}{\\ell_{\\mathrm{node}}} $$\nThis ratio represents the factor by which the active membrane area increases upon demyelination.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\nWe substitute the given values into the final expression. To ensure dimensional consistency, we convert all lengths to the same unit (e.g., micrometers, $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$).\n- $\\ell_{\\mathrm{internode}} = 1 \\,\\mathrm{mm} = 1000 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\ell_{\\mathrm{node}} = 1 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n\n$$ \\text{Fold-increase} = \\frac{1000 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{1 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = 1000 $$\nThe fold-increase in the number of ATP molecules required is $1000$. This is a pure, dimensionless number, as required. The values for $L$, $a$, $c_u$, and $\\Delta V$ are not needed for the final ratio, highlighting that this increase is a fundamental consequence of the change in conduction mechanism from saltatory to continuous.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1000}\n$$", "id": "4410566"}, {"introduction": "A key feature of Multiple Sclerosis is the inflammatory process within the central nervous system, leading to local production of antibodies.
