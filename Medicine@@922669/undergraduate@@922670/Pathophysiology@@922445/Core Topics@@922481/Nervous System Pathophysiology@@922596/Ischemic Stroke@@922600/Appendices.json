This exercise uses the principles of fluid dynamics to explore the dramatic relationship between a vessel's radius and the volume of blood that can flow through it. By applying the Hagen-Poiseuille law, you will calculate how a seemingly moderate reduction in the size of a small artery leads to a catastrophic drop in downstream perfusion, illustrating the physical basis of ischemia [@problem_id:4803181].", "problem": "A small penetrating arteriole (a perforator) supplying deep gray matter is acutely narrowed during an ischemic stroke. Assume blood can be approximated as a Newtonian fluid with constant dynamic viscosity $\\eta$, the vessel segment behaves as a rigid cylinder of fixed length $L$, and the flow regime is laminar. Immediately after the narrowing, the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) across this perforator is maintained approximately constant by autoregulatory mechanisms elsewhere in the circulation. Collateral flow is negligible, and the resistance of this narrowed perforator dominates the downstream bed.\n\nThe luminal radius decreases from $75\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$ to $50\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Using appropriate physical and physiological principles and starting from fundamental definitions, determine the predicted downstream volumetric perfusion (flow) as a fraction of its baseline value, given the assumptions above and the dominance of this segment’s resistance. Report only the final fractional value relative to baseline as an exact simplified fraction without units; do not round.", "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of fluid flow through a cylindrical vessel whose radius changes. The physical principles governing this scenario are found in fluid dynamics, specifically the Hagen-Poiseuille law for laminar flow in a pipe.\n\nThe relationship between the volumetric flow rate $Q$, the pressure drop across the vessel $\\Delta P$, and the hydraulic resistance $R$ of the vessel is given by an equation analogous to Ohm's law:\n$$ \\Delta P = Q R $$\nThe problem states that the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) across the perforator is maintained approximately constant. We identify this CPP with the pressure drop $\\Delta P$. Therefore, $\\Delta P$ is a constant. This allows us to write the flow rate $Q$ as:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R} $$\nThis shows that the flow rate $Q$ is inversely proportional to the resistance $R$ when the pressure drop $\\Delta P$ is held constant.\n\nFor laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid with dynamic viscosity $\\eta$ through a rigid cylindrical tube of length $L$ and internal radius $r$, the hydraulic resistance $R$ is given by Poiseuille's law:\n$$ R = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4} $$\nThe resistance is strongly dependent on the radius, varying as the inverse fourth power, $R \\propto r^{-4}$.\n\nBy substituting the expression for resistance $R$ into the equation for flow $Q$, we obtain the full Hagen-Poiseuille equation for flow rate:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\Delta P}{ \\left( \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4} \\right) } = \\frac{\\Delta P \\pi r^4}{8 \\eta L} $$\nFrom this equation, we can see that for constant $\\Delta P$, $\\eta$, and $L$, the volumetric flow rate $Q$ is directly proportional to the fourth power of the radius $r$:\n$$ Q \\propto r^4 $$\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio of the final (post-narrowing) flow rate, $Q_2$, to the initial (baseline) flow rate, $Q_1$. Let the initial radius be $r_1$ and the final radius be $r_2$.\nThe initial flow rate is:\n$$ Q_1 = \\frac{\\Delta P \\pi r_1^4}{8 \\eta L} $$\nThe final flow rate is:\n$$ Q_2 = \\frac{\\Delta P \\pi r_2^4}{8 \\eta L} $$\n\nTo find the desired fraction, we compute the ratio $\\frac{Q_2}{Q_1}$:\n$$ \\frac{Q_2}{Q_1} = \\frac{\\frac{\\Delta P \\pi r_2^4}{8 \\eta L}}{\\frac{\\Delta P \\pi r_1^4}{8 \\eta L}} $$\nThe constant terms $\\Delta P$, $\\pi$, $8$, $\\eta$, and $L$ cancel out, leaving a simple ratio of the radii raised to the fourth power:\n$$ \\frac{Q_2}{Q_1} = \\frac{r_2^4}{r_1^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_2}{r_1}\\right)^4 $$\n\nThe problem provides the following values for the radii:\nInitial radius, $r_1 = 75\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nFinal radius, $r_2 = 50\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the ratio expression:\n$$ \\frac{Q_2}{Q_1} = \\left(\\frac{50\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}}{75\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}}\\right)^4 $$\nThe units $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ cancel out. We simplify the fraction inside the parentheses:\n$$ \\frac{50}{75} = \\frac{2 \\times 25}{3 \\times 25} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\nNow, we raise this fraction to the fourth power:\n$$ \\frac{Q_2}{Q_1} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2^4}{3^4} = \\frac{16}{81} $$\n\nThus, the predicted downstream volumetric perfusion is $\\frac{16}{81}$ of its baseline value. This result highlights the critical sensitivity of blood flow to small changes in vessel radius, a fundamental concept in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke.
