Consider a saccular intracranial aneurysm whose dome can be locally approximated as a thin-walled cylindrical segment with constant radius $r$ and wall thickness $h$ over a short systolic upstroke. The instantaneous circumferential wall tension $T$ is related to intraluminal pressure $P$ by the well-established thin-wall relation $T = \\dfrac{P r}{2 h}$. During vigorous exertion, the rate of rise of arterial pressure increases, which can be represented over a short time window by a linear pressure trajectory $P(t) = P_{0} + \\alpha t$, where $t$ is time, $P_{0}$ is the pressure at the start of systolic upstroke, and $\\alpha = dP/dt$ is the slope of the pressure rise.\n\nAssume the following physiologically plausible parameters for a patient with a posterior communicating artery aneurysm:\n- Baseline starting pressure $P_{0} = 90\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$,\n- Resting slope $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{rest}} = 400\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$,\n- Exertion slope $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{exert}} = 1600\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$,\n- Evaluation time $\\Delta t = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{s}$,\n- Aneurysm radius $r = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and wall thickness $h = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nAssume $r$ and $h$ remain constant over the short interval $\\Delta t$, the aneurysm wall behaves as a thin membrane under uniform internal pressure, and the blood inertia does not alter the instantaneous force balance embodied in the thin-wall relation.

The use of the Law of Laplace is appropriate for modeling stress in a thin-walled vessel. There are two minor points of imprecision:\n    -   The quantity $T$ is labeled \"tension\" but its definition, $T = \\dfrac{P r}{2 h}$, gives it units of force per area (e.g., $\\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{m}^2$), which is **stress**.

Aneurysmal rupture is a mechanical failure event that occurs when the local wall stress exceeds the ultimate tensile strength of the wall tissue. The wall of an aneurysm is pathologically remodeled, often thinner, and biochemically weaker than a healthy arterial wall. This substantial, albeit transient, increase in wall stress during exertion significantly elevates the probability of reaching the critical failure point. This model, though simplified, effectively demonstrates the direct mechanistic link between hemodynamic factors associated with physical exertion (specifically, a more rapid rate of pressure increase, $\\frac{dP}{dt}$) and the acute risk of aneurysm rupture, which is the primary cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage. The higher rate of loading, $\\frac{dT}{dt}$, may also contribute to failure, as biomaterials can be sensitive to the strain rate.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.353}\n$$", "id": "4837265"}, {"introduction": "Following an aneurysmal rupture, the immediate and life-threatening consequence is the rapid accumulation of blood within the fixed volume of the cranial vault.
