This exercise [@problem_id:2344279] provides a quantitative look at how a stimulant like cocaine alters the normal dynamics of dopamine, a key neurotransmitter in the brain's reward pathway. By modeling dopamine clearance as a first-order process, you will calculate precisely how inhibiting the dopamine transporter (DAT) amplifies and prolongs the dopamine signal, which is the neurochemical basis for the drug's acute reinforcing effects.", "problem": "A neuroscientist is using Fast-Scan Cyclic Voltammetry (FSCV) to study the real-time dynamics of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens of a rat model of addiction. The FSCV technique provides a signal directly proportional to the extracellular concentration of dopamine. The clearance of dopamine from the synapse after its release is accurately modeled as a first-order decay process, which can be characterized by a half-life, $t_{1/2}$. A useful metric for the total effect of a dopamine release event is the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the resulting concentration-versus-time plot.\n\nUnder normal physiological conditions, the half-life of dopamine due to reuptake by the Dopamine Transporter (DAT) is measured to be $t_{1/2, \\text{normal}}$. Following a self-administered intravenous infusion of cocaine, the drug acts as a potent DAT inhibitor. At the administered dose, cocaine is found to block 80% of the functional DATs in the nucleus accumbens.\n\nAssuming that the rate of dopamine clearance is directly proportional to the number of available, unblocked DATs and that the amount of dopamine released per neural signal is the same before and after the drug, calculate the ratio of the signal AUC after cocaine administration ($AUC_{\\text{cocaine}}$) to the signal AUC under normal conditions ($AUC_{\\text{normal}}$). The final answer should be a single real number.", "solution": "The problem asks for the ratio $\\frac{AUC_{\\text{cocaine}}}{AUC_{\\text{normal}}}$. We are given that dopamine clearance follows first-order kinetics.\n\nThe concentration of dopamine $[DA]$ at a time $t$ after a release event can be described by the equation:\n$$[DA](t) = [DA]_0 \\exp(-k t)$$\nwhere $[DA]_0$ is the initial concentration of dopamine released at $t=0$, and $k$ is the first-order rate constant for clearance.\n\nThe half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is related to the rate constant $k$ by the well-known formula for first-order decay:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}$$\nThis implies that the rate constant $k$ is inversely proportional to the half-life $t_{1/2}$.\n\nThe Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the concentration-time plot is the definite integral of the concentration from $t=0$ to $t=\\infty$. The AUC represents the total dopamine exposure over time.\n$$AUC = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} [DA](t) \\,dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} [DA]_0 \\exp(-k t) \\,dt$$\n\nPerforming the integration:\n$$AUC = [DA]_0 \\left[ -\\frac{1}{k} \\exp(-k t) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}$$\n$$AUC = [DA]_0 \\left( \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{1}{k} \\exp(-k t)\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{k} \\exp(0)\\right) \\right)$$\n$$AUC = [DA]_0 \\left( 0 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{k}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{[DA]_0}{k}$$\nThis result shows that the AUC is inversely proportional to the clearance rate constant, $k$.\n\nWe can also express the AUC in terms of the half-life by substituting $k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$:\n$$AUC = \\frac{[DA]_0}{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}} = \\frac{[DA]_0 \\cdot t_{1/2}}{\\ln(2)}$$\nThis shows that the AUC is directly proportional to the half-life, $t_{1/2}$, assuming the initial amount of dopamine released, $[DA]_0$, is constant.\n\nNow, let's analyze the effect of cocaine. The problem states that the rate of dopamine clearance is directly proportional to the number of functional Dopamine Transporters (DATs). Let $k_{\\text{normal}}$ be the rate constant under normal conditions.\nCocaine blocks 80% of the DATs. This means that only $100\\% - 80\\% = 20\\%$ of the transporters remain functional.\nSince the clearance rate is proportional to the number of functional DATs, the new rate constant, $k_{\\text{cocaine}}$, will be 20% of the normal rate constant.\n$$k_{\\text{cocaine}} = 0.20 \\times k_{\\text{normal}} = \\frac{1}{5} k_{\\text{normal}}$$\n\nWe need to find the ratio $\\frac{AUC_{\\text{cocaine}}}{AUC_{\\text{normal}}}$.

Since $AUC$ is directly proportional to $t_{1/2}$:\n$$\\frac{AUC_{\\text{cocaine}}}{AUC_{\\text{normal}}} = \\frac{t_{1/2, \\text{cocaine}}}{t_{1/2, \\text{normal}}} = \\frac{5 \\times t_{1/2, \\text{normal}}}{t_{1/2, \\text{normal}}} = 5$$\nBoth methods yield the same result.

Consider a simple one-step temporal-difference learning scenario in which an agent transitions from state $s_t$ to state $s_{t+1}$ at time $t$, receives an immediate primary reward $r_t$, and maintains a scalar state-value function $V(s)$ that is interpreted biologically as the current prediction of discounted future reward. Use the following foundational bases: the discounted return is defined as $G_t = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^{k} r_{t+k}$ with discount factor $\\gamma \\in (0,1)$, and the state value is $V(s) = \\mathbb{E}[G_t \\mid s_t = s]$. From these definitions and the consistency of $V(s)$ with the discounted return, derive the canonical one-step temporal-difference RPE appropriate for mapping to phasic dopamine dynamics, and then compute its value for a single trial with $r_t = 1$, $\\gamma = 0.95$, $V(s_{t+1}) = 0.8$, and $V(s_t) = 0.5$. Round your numerical result to four significant figures and report it as a pure number with no units.

The RPE, denoted as $\\delta_t$, is hypothesized to be encoded by the phasic activity of dopamine neurons.\n\nThe derivation begins with the foundational definitions provided. The discounted return at time $t$ is given by:\n$$G_t = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^{k} r_{t+k}$$\nwhere $r_{t+k}$ is the reward received at time $t+k$ and $\\gamma \\in (0,1)$ is the discount factor.\n\nThe state-value function, $V(s)$, is the expectation of this discounted return, given the current state $s_t=s$:\n$$V(s) = \\mathbb{E}[G_t \\mid s_t = s]$$\n\nTo derive the one-step RPE, we first establish a recursive relationship for the discounted return, $G_t$. We can expand the sum for $G_t$ as:\n$$G_t = r_t + \\gamma r_{t+1} + \\gamma^2 r_{t+2} + \\dots$$\nFactoring out a $\\gamma$ from all terms except the first gives:\n$$G_t = r_t + \\gamma (r_{t+1} + \\gamma r_{t+2} + \\dots)$$\nThe term in the parenthesis is, by definition, the discounted return starting from time $t+1$, which is $G_{t+1}$. This yields the fundamental recursive relationship:\n$$G_t = r_t + \\gamma G_{t+1}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute this recursive form of $G_t$ into the definition of the state-value function $V(s_t)$:\n$$V(s_t) = \\mathbb{E}[r_t + \\gamma G_{t+1} \\mid s_t]$$\nUsing the linearity of the expectation operator, we can separate the terms:\n$$V(s_t) = \\mathbb{E}[r_t \\mid s_t] + \\mathbb{E}[\\gamma G_{t+1} \\mid s_t]$$\n$$V(s_t) = \\mathbb{E}[r_t \\mid s_t] + \\gamma \\mathbb{E}[G_{t+1} \\mid s_t]$$\nThe term $\\mathbb{E}[G_{t+1} \\mid s_t]$ represents the expected return from the next time step, given the current state $s_t$. By the law of total expectation, this can be written as the expectation over all possible next states $s_{t+1}$ of the value of those states: $\\mathbb{E}_{s_{t+1}}[\\mathbb{E}[G_{t+1} \\mid s_{t+1}]] = \\mathbb{E}[V(s_{t+1}) \\mid s_t]$. This leads to the Bellman equation for the value function:\n$$V(s_t) = \\mathbb{E}[r_t + \\gamma V(s_{t+1}) \\mid s_t]$$\n\nThe temporal-difference RPE, $\\delta_t$, is the difference between an updated estimate of the value of state $s_t$ and the current estimate, $V(s_t)$. The updated estimate, known as the TD target, is formed using the actual reward $r_t$ received at time $t$ and the current estimate of the value of the successor state, $V(s_{t+1})$. For a single, observed transition, the TD target is $r_t + \\gamma V(s_{t+1})$.\n\nThe RPE is therefore the difference between this target and the agent's prior prediction, $V(s_t)$:\n$$\\delta_t = \\left( r_t + \\gamma V(s_{t+1}) \\right) - V(s_t)$$\nThis is the canonical expression for the one-step temporal-difference reward prediction error.\n\nThe problem then requires the computation of $\\delta_t$ for a single trial with the following given values:\n- Immediate reward: $r_t = 1$\n- Discount factor: $\\gamma = 0.95$\n- Value of the next state: $V(s_{t+1}) = 0.8$\n- Value of the current state: $V(s_t) = 0.5$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula for $\\delta_t$:\n$$\\delta_t = 1 + (0.95 \\times 0.8) - 0.5$$\nFirst, we compute the product:\n$$0.95 \\times 0.8 = 0.76$$\nNow, we substitute this back into the equation for $\\delta_t$:\n$$\\delta_t = 1 + 0.76 - 0.5$$\n$$\\delta_t = 1.76 - 0.5$$\n$$\\delta_t = 1.26$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, the value is $1.260$.\n\nQualitatively, the computed RPE is $\\delta_t = 1.260$. Since this value is positive, it signifies a \"positive prediction error,\" meaning the actual experienced outcome (immediate reward plus the discounted value of the future) was better than predicted. According to the dopamine RPE hypothesis, a positive $\\delta_t$ would be encoded by a transient, phasic increase in the firing rate of VTA dopamine neurons above their tonic baseline.
