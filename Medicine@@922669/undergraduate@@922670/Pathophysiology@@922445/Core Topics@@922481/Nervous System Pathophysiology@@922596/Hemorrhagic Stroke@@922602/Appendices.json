In hemorrhagic stroke, the volume of the extravasated blood is a primary determinant of patient outcome. A large hematoma exerts significant mass effect on the surrounding brain parenchyma, leading to an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP). Elevated ICP can reduce cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), causing secondary ischemic injury to brain tissue. Furthermore, significant mass effect can lead to the displacement of brain structures and potentially fatal brain herniation. The breakdown products of blood, such as hemoglobin and iron, are also neurotoxic and contribute to perihematomal edema and inflammation, exacerbating the secondary injury. Therefore, the initial hematoma volume is a critical prognostic indicator used in clinical scoring systems (e.g., the ICH score) to predict mortality and functional outcome. It also guides clinical management, including decisions regarding surgical evacuation versus medical management.\n\nNext, we derive the volume of the hematoma modeled as an ellipsoid, $V_{\\text{ellipsoid}}$. The volume of an ellipsoid is given by the formula:\n$$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_a r_b r_c$$\nwhere $r_a$, $r_b$, and $r_c$ are the lengths of the three orthogonal semi-axes. The problem provides the maximal orthogonal diameters, denoted as $a$, $b$, and $c$. These diameters correspond to the full lengths of the principal axes of the ellipsoid. The relationship between a diameter and its corresponding semi-axis is:\n$$r_a = \\frac{a}{2}, \\quad r_b = \\frac{b}{2}, \\quad r_c = \\frac{c}{2}$$\nSubstituting these expressions for the semi-axes into the volume formula gives the volume of the ellipsoid in terms of its diameters:\n$$V_{\\text{ellipsoid}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{c}{2}\\right)$$\n$$V_{\\text{ellipsoid}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\frac{abc}{8}$$\n$$V_{\\text{ellipsoid}} = \\frac{\\pi}{6} abc$$\n\nThe problem then introduces the clinical heuristic known as the $ABC/2$ rule for estimating the volume. Using the same diameter notations $a$, $b$, and $c$, this estimate is constructed as:\n$$V_{ABC/2} = \\frac{abc}{2}$$\nThis formula is an approximation that essentially models the hematoma as a rectangular prism with volume $abc$ and then divides by $2$, which implicitly approximates the factor $\\pi/6$ with $1/2$.\n\nNow, we compute the signed fractional error, $\\varepsilon$, of the $ABC/2$ estimate relative to the ellipsoid model. The error is defined as:\n$$\\varepsilon = \\frac{V_{ABC/2} - V_{\\text{ellipsoid}}}{V_{\\text{ellipsoid}}}$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for the volumes:\n$$\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\frac{abc}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{6}abc}{\\frac{\\pi}{6}abc}$$\nWe can cancel the common term $abc$ from the numerator and the denominator, as long as $abc \\neq 0$, which is true for a non-trivial hematoma.\n$$\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{6}}{\\frac{\\pi}{6}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{\\pi}{6}} - 1 = \\frac{6}{2\\pi} - 1$$\n$$\\varepsilon = \\frac{3}{\\pi} - 1$$\nThis result shows that the fractional error of the $ABC/2$ rule, when compared to a perfect ellipsoid model, is a constant value independent of the specific dimensions of the hematoma.\n\nFinally, we perform the numerical evaluation using the given diameters: $a = 2.5$ $\\mathrm{cm}$, $b = 3.0$ $\\mathrm{cm}$, and $c = 2.0$ $\\mathrm{cm}$. First, we calculate the product of the diameters:\n$$abc = (2.5) (3.0) (2.0) = 15.0 \\, \\mathrm{cm}^3$$\nUsing the conversion $1 \\, \\mathrm{cm}^3 = 1 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$, the volumes are:\n$$V_{\\text{ellipsoid}} = \\frac{\\pi}{6} (15.0) = 2.5\\pi \\, \\mathrm{mL} \\approx 7.85398 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$$\n$$V_{ABC/2} = \\frac{15.0}{2} = 7.5 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value of the signed fractional error $\\varepsilon$ using the exact analytical expression:\n$$\\varepsilon = \\frac{3}{\\pi} - 1 \\approx \\frac{3}{3.14159265...} - 1 \\approx 0.95492965... - 1$$\n$$\\varepsilon \\approx -0.04507034...$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the $ABC/2$ rule underestimates the volume compared to the ideal ellipsoid model, because the approximation factor $1/2 = 0.5$ is less than the true geometric factor $\\pi/6 \\approx 0.5236$.\n\nThe problem requires reporting $\\varepsilon$ as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.

This will be addressed in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: First-principles explanation of the clinical dilemma.\n\nThe problem provides two key relationships governing the local environment of the hematoma:\n1. The instantaneous tendency for hematoma expansion is a monotonically increasing function of the transmural driving pressure, $P_{t}$, given by $P_{t} = MAP - P_{\\text{ph}}$.\n2. The local Cerebral Perfusion Pressure, $CPP_{\\text{local}}$, which drives blood flow to the surrounding brain tissue, is given by $CPP_{\\text{local}} = MAP - P_{\\text{ph}}$.\n\nFrom these definitions, it is immediately apparent that in this model, $P_{t} = CPP_{\\text{local}}$. Let us denote this common pressure as $P_{\\text{driving}} = MAP - P_{\\text{ph}}$. This pressure simultaneously represents the force driving blood out of the ruptured vessel (promoting hemorrhage expansion) and the force driving blood into the capillary beds of the surrounding tissue (maintaining tissue viability).\n\nTo reduce the tendency for hematoma expansion, one must reduce the transmural pressure, $P_{t}$. Since $P_{\\text{ph}}$ (the perihematomal tissue pressure) is a consequence of the existing mass and edema, the only externally controllable variable in the expression for $P_{t}$ is the $MAP$. Therefore, reducing $MAP$ directly reduces $P_{t}$, which monotonically reduces the rate of hemorrhage expansion. This is the therapeutic goal of lowering blood pressure.\n\nHowever, this action has a critical consequence for the perihematomal tissue. The Cerebral Blood Flow ($CBF$) to this region is governed by the $CPP_{\\text{local}}$. The problem states that cerebral autoregulation maintains a constant $CBF$ only when $CPP_{\\text{local}}$ is within the patient-specific range $[CPP_{L}, CPP_{U}]$. For this patient, this range is given as $[70, 100]$ mmHg. If $CPP_{\\text{local}}$ falls below the lower limit of autoregulation, $CPP_{L}$, the cerebral arterioles are maximally dilated and cerebrovascular resistance, $R$, cannot decrease further. In this pressure-passive state, $CBF$ becomes directly proportional to $CPP_{\\text{local}}$. A sufficiently low $CPP_{\\text{local}}$ will result in critically low $CBF$, leading to metabolic failure and ischemic injury in the perihematomal penumbra.\n\nSince lowering $MAP$ also lowers $CPP_{\\text{local}}$ (as $CPP_{\\text{local}} = MAP - P_{\\text{ph}}$), an overly aggressive reduction of $MAP$ risks pushing $CPP_{\\text{local}}$ below $CPP_{L}$, thereby inducing ischemia. This establishes the fundamental conflict: lowering $MAP$ is beneficial for controlling hemorrhage expansion but is detrimental if it compromises perfusion to a critical degree.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the condition on $MAP$.\n\nThe primary constraint for maintaining tissue viability is to keep the local cerebral perfusion pressure within the autoregulatory range. This ensures that the cerebral vasculature can properly regulate blood flow. The condition is expressed as:\n$$CPP_{L} \\leq CPP_{\\text{local}} \\leq CPP_{U}$$\nSubstituting the definition $CPP_{\\text{local}} = MAP - P_{\\text{ph}}$ into this inequality, we have:\n$$CPP_{L} \\leq MAP - P_{\\text{ph}} \\leq CPP_{U}$$\nTo derive the condition on $MAP$, we isolate $MAP$ by adding $P_{\\text{ph}}$ to all three parts of the compound inequality:\n$$CPP_{L} + P_{\\text{ph}} \\leq MAP \\leq CPP_{U} + P_{\\text{ph}}$$\nThis inequality defines the \"safe window\" for $MAP$. Any $MAP$ within this range will ensure that $CPP_{\\text{local}}$ is within the bounds where autoregulation is functional, preventing ischemia from hypoperfusion and also avoiding potential luxury perfusion or breakthrough edema at the upper end. The clinical goal is to minimize $P_{t} = MAP - P_{\\text{ph}}$, which is equivalent to minimizing $MAP$. Therefore, the therapeutic target would be at or slightly above the lower bound of this safe window, $MAP_{\\text{min}} = CPP_{L} + P_{\\text{ph}}$. The full safe range is the interval $[MAP_{\\text{min}}, MAP_{\\text{max}}]$.\n\nPart 3: Computation of the numerical safe window for $MAP$.\n\nWe are given the following patient-specific values:\n- Perihematomal tissue pressure, $P_{\\text{ph}} = 30$ mmHg.\n- Lower limit of autoregulation, $CPP_{L} = 70$ mmHg.\n- Upper limit of autoregulation, $CPP_{U} = 100$ mmHg.\n\nUsing the derived condition, we can compute the lower and upper bounds for the safe $MAP$ window.\n\nThe lower bound for $MAP$ is:\n$$MAP_{\\text{min}} = CPP_{L} + P_{\\text{ph}}$$\n$$MAP_{\\text{min}} = 70 + 30 = 100$$\nAll units are in mmHg.\n\nThe upper bound for $MAP$ is:\n$$MAP_{\\text{max}} = CPP_{U} + P_{\\text{ph}}$$\n$$MAP_{\\text{max}} = 100 + 30 = 130$$\nAll units are in mmHg.\n\nTherefore, the numerical safe window for $MAP$ that maintains adequate cerebral perfusion pressure in the perihematomal region is the closed interval $[100, 130]$ mmHg. The two endpoints of this window are $100$ and $130$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 100  130 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4790382"}, {"introduction": "Predicting whether a hematoma will continue to expand is key to guiding urgent therapies aimed at stopping the bleeding.
