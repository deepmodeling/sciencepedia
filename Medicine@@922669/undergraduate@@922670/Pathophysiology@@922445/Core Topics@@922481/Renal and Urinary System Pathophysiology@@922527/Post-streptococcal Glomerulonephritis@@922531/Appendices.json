A key diagnostic feature of PSGN lies in the specific way it activates the complement system, a cascade of proteins crucial for fighting infections.

Complement component 3 (C3) and complement component 4 (C4) are measured. A prior well-visit laboratory record shows a baseline C3 of $1.2$ g/L. At the acute presentation, the observed C3 is $0.5$ g/L and C4 is reported within the laboratory’s reference interval (normal). Starting from the foundational definitions of the complement pathways and their consumption patterns, compute the fractional reduction in C3 relative to baseline, expressed as a unitless decimal (i.e., the percentage divided by $100$). Round your numerical answer to $4$ significant figures. Then, based on complement pathway physiology, deduce whether the pattern of low C3 with normal C4 favors alternative pathway–predominant disease such as post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis over classical pathway–dominant disease, and justify your conclusion mechanistically.", "solution": "The complement system can be activated through at least two major pathways: the classical pathway and the alternative pathway. The classical pathway is typically initiated by antigen–antibody complexes, requires complement component C1, and rapidly consumes components C4 and C2 en route to generating the C3 convertase; thus, classical pathway–dominant activity characteristically lowers both C3 and C4. In contrast, the alternative pathway is initiated independently of antibodies through spontaneous hydrolysis of C3, and its amplification loop (involving factor $B$, factor $D$, and properdin) predominantly consumes C3 while typically sparing C4. Therefore, a laboratory pattern of reduced C3 with normal C4 suggests alternative pathway–predominant activation. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) classically exhibits this pattern due to immune complex deposition and complement activation favoring the alternative pathway within glomeruli.\n\nTo quantify the change in C3, we use the standard definition of fractional reduction relative to baseline:\n$$\nr \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{baseline} - \\text{acute}}{\\text{baseline}} \\, .\n$$\nLet the baseline C3 be $C3_{0} = 1.2$ g/L and the acute C3 be $C3_{a} = 0.5$ g/L.

As the classical pathway consumes both C3 and C4, normal C4 argues against classical pathway–dominant disease. The alternative pathway preferentially consumes C3 while sparing C4, which is concordant with the observed pattern. Consequently, this constellation favors alternative pathway–predominant disease, aligning with the pathophysiology of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.\n\nThus, the requested fractional reduction is $0.5833$ (rounded to $4$ significant figures), and the mechanistic interpretation supports PSGN over classical pathway–dominant conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5833}$$", "id": "4826021"}, {"introduction": "Having established the immunological trigger, we now examine its direct physical impact on the kidney's filtering units, the glomeruli.

Round your answer to three significant figures. Then, based on established renal physiology, explain qualitatively whether the computed value aligns with the expected tubular handling of sodium in PSGN.", "solution": "The problem requires a two-part response: first, the calculation of the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), and second, a qualitative explanation of whether this value is consistent with the pathophysiology of Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN).\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)**\n\nThe fractional excretion of sodium ($FENa$) is defined as the fraction of sodium filtered by the glomeruli that is ultimately excreted in the urine. It is a measure of the renal tubules' ability to reabsorb sodium.\n\nThe formula for $FENa$ is:\n$$FENa = \\frac{\\text{Sodium Excreted}}{\\text{Sodium Filtered}}$$\n\nThe amount of sodium excreted per unit time is the product of the urine flow rate ($V$) and the urine sodium concentration ($U_{Na}$):\n$$\\text{Sodium Excreted} = V \\times U_{Na}$$\n\nThe amount of sodium filtered per unit time is the product of the Glomerular Filtration Rate ($GFR$) and the plasma sodium concentration ($P_{Na}$):\n$$\\text{Sodium Filtered} = GFR \\times P_{Na}$$\n\nSubstituting these into the main equation gives:\n$$FENa = \\frac{V \\times U_{Na}}{GFR \\times P_{Na}}$$\n\nThe $GFR$ is not directly given, but it can be estimated by the creatinine clearance ($C_{Cr}$), as creatinine is freely filtered at the glomerulus and not significantly reabsorbed or secreted by the tubules (though minor secretion exists, this approximation is standard for this calculation). The formula for creatinine clearance is:\n$$C_{Cr} \\approx GFR = \\frac{V \\times U_{Cr}}{P_{Cr}}$$\nwhere $U_{Cr}$ is the urine creatinine concentration and $P_{Cr}$ is the plasma creatinine concentration.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $GFR$ into the $FENa$ equation:\n$$FENa = \\frac{V \\times U_{Na}}{\\left(\\frac{V \\times U_{Cr}}{P_{Cr}}\\right) \\times P_{Na}}$$\n\nThe urine flow rate, $V$, cancels from the numerator and denominator, yielding the standard clinical formula for $FENa$ which does not require a timed urine collection:\n$$FENa = \\frac{U_{Na} \\times P_{Cr}}{P_{Na} \\times U_{Cr}}$$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Urine sodium concentration, $U_{Na} = 21 \\text{ mmol/L}$\n- Plasma sodium concentration, $P_{Na} = 140 \\text{ mmol/L}$\n- Urine creatinine concentration, $U_{Cr} = 105 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n- Plasma creatinine concentration, $P_{Cr} = 2.1 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n\nWe can now substitute these values into the formula. The units for sodium concentration (mmol/L) and creatinine concentration (mg/dL) are consistent and will cancel out, resulting in a dimensionless quantity as expected.\n\n$$FENa = \\frac{(21) \\times (2.1)}{(140) \\times (105)}$$\n$$FENa = \\frac{44.1}{14700}$$\n$$FENa = 0.003$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $0.003$ must be expressed as $0.00300$ to meet this requirement.\n\n**Part 2: Qualitative Pathophysiological Explanation**\n\nThe calculated $FENa$ is $0.003$, which is equivalent to $0.3\\%$. The second part of the task is to determine if this value is consistent with the pathophysiology of PSGN.\n\nPSGN is a classic example of acute nephritic syndrome, a form of intrinsic acute kidney injury (AKI). The primary pathological event is the deposition of immune complexes in the glomeruli following a streptococcal infection. This incites an inflammatory response that damages the glomerular basement membrane and reduces the surface area available for filtration, leading to a significant decrease in the $GFR$.\n\nThe $FENa$ is a critical diagnostic tool used to differentiate causes of AKI.\n- A low $FENa$ (conventionally $<1\\%$, or $<0.01$) suggests a prerenal state (e.g., volume depletion), where the kidneys are hypoperfused but the tubules are healthy and are avidly reabsorbing sodium and water to conserve volume.\n- A high $FENa$ (conventionally $>2\\%$, or $>0.02$) is characteristic of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), an intrinsic renal injury where damaged tubules are incapable of reabsorbing sodium, leading to sodium \"wasting\" in the urine.\n\nAlthough PSGN is classified as an intrinsic cause of AKI, its effect on sodium handling is distinct from that of ATN. In PSGN, the primary injury is glomerular, while the tubular function is largely preserved, especially in the early stages. The profound decrease in $GFR$ leads to a reduced filtered load of sodium. Furthermore, the body perceives a state of decreased effective circulating volume, which activates the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS). The resulting increase in aldosterone levels acts on the distal tubules and collecting ducts, stimulating them to avidly reabsorb sodium and water.\n\nThis combination of reduced filtration and enhanced tubular reabsorption of sodium results in profound sodium and water retention. Clinically, this manifests as oliguria, edema (as described by the periorbital edema), and volume-dependent hypertension. From a laboratory perspective, this avid sodium reabsorption leads to a very low urinary sodium concentration and consequently a low $FENa$, typically less than $1\\%$.\n\nTherefore, the calculated $FENa$ of $0.00300$ (or $0.3\\%$) is low and falls squarely within the range expected for PSGN. This low value reflects intact tubular function and a robust neurohormonal response (RAAS activation) to a primary decrease in glomerular filtration, a hallmark of the pathophysiology of acute glomerulonephritis. The result correctly aligns with the expected tubular handling of sodium in this disease process.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.00300}$$", "id": "4434623"}]}
