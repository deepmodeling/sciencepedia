A complete solution will be constructed.\n\nSOLUTION\n\n**1. Derivation of the Expression for $P_{GC}$**\n\nThe system consists of the afferent resistance $R_A$ and the efferent resistance $R_E$ in series, placed between the arterial pressure $P_A$ and the venous pressure $P_V$.\n\nThe total pressure drop across the series network is $\\Delta P_{total} = P_A - P_V$.\nThe total resistance of the network is the sum of the series resistances: $R_{total} = R_A + R_E$.\n\nAccording to the provided Ohmic relation, the volumetric flow rate $Q$ through the entire network is constant and is given by:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\Delta P_{total}}{R_{total}} = \\frac{P_A - P_V}{R_A + R_E}$$\nThe glomerular capillary pressure, $P_{GC}$, is the pressure at the node between the two resistors. We can determine $P_{GC}$ by analyzing the pressure drop across the afferent arteriole, $R_A$. The pressure drop across this segment is $\\Delta P_A = P_A - P_{GC}$.\n\nApplying the Ohmic relation to the afferent segment:\n$$P_A - P_{GC} = Q \\times R_A$$\nSubstitute the expression for $Q$ into this equation:\n$$P_A - P_{GC} = \\left( \\frac{P_A - P_V}{R_A + R_E} \\right) R_A$$\nWe now solve for $P_{GC}$ by isolating it:\n$$P_{GC} = P_A - \\left( \\frac{P_A - P_V}{R_A + R_E} \\right) R_A$$\nTo simplify this expression, we place all terms over a common denominator, $R_A + R_E$:\n$$P_{GC} = \\frac{P_A(R_A + R_E) - (P_A - P_V)R_A}{R_A + R_E}$$\nExpanding the numerator:\n$$P_{GC} = \\frac{P_A R_A + P_A R_E - P_A R_A + P_V R_A}{R_A + R_E}$$\nThe $P_A R_A$ terms cancel, yielding the final expression for $P_{GC}$:\n$$P_{GC} = \\frac{P_A R_E + P_V R_A}{R_A + R_E}$$\nThis completes the derivation required by the first part of the task.\n\n**2. Calculation of $\\Delta P_{GC}$**\n\nFirst, we compute the baseline glomerular capillary pressure, $P_{GC,\\text{baseline}}$, using the derived formula and the given baseline values: $P_A = 100$ mmHg, $P_V = 10$ mmHg, $R_{A0} = 1.5$, and $R_{E0} = 1.0$.\n$$P_{GC,\\text{baseline}} = \\frac{P_A R_{E0} + P_V R_{A0}}{R_{A0} + R_{E0}} = \\frac{(100)(1.0) + (10)(1.5)}{1.5 + 1.0}$$\n$$P_{GC,\\text{baseline}} = \\frac{100 + 15}{2.5} = \\frac{115}{2.5} = 46 \\text{ mmHg}$$\nNext, we determine the new resistance values. The afferent resistance, $R_A$, decreases by $30\\%$ ($0.30$), and the efferent resistance, $R_E$, increases by $20\\%$ ($0.20$).\nNew afferent resistance, $R_{A,\\text{new}}$:\n$$R_{A,\\text{new}} = R_{A0} (1 - 0.30) = 1.5 \\times 0.7 = 1.05$$\nNew efferent resistance, $R_{E,\\text{new}}$:\n$$R_{E,\\text{new}} = R_{E0} (1 + 0.20) = 1.0 \\times 1.2 = 1.2$$\nNow, we compute the new glomerular capillary pressure, $P_{GC,\\text{new}}$, using these updated resistance values:\n$$P_{GC,\\text{new}} = \\frac{P_A R_{E,\\text{new}} + P_V R_{A,\\text{new}}}{R_{A,\\text{new}} + R_{E,\\text{new}}} = \\frac{(100)(1.2) + (10)(1.05)}{1.05 + 1.2}$$\n$$P_{GC,\\text{new}} = \\frac{120 + 10.5}{2.25} = \\frac{130.5}{2.25} = 58 \\text{ mmHg}$$\nFinally, we compute the change in glomerular capillary pressure, $\\Delta P_{GC}$:\n$$\\Delta P_{GC} = P_{GC,\\text{new}} - P_{GC,\\text{baseline}} = 58 \\text{ mmHg} - 46 \\text{ mmHg} = 12 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n\n**3. Mechanistic Justification for Glomerular Injury**\n\nThe combination of a $30\\%$ decrease in afferent arteriolar resistance and a $20\\%$ increase in efferent arteriolar resistance synergistically elevates the glomerular capillary pressure, $P_{GC}$, from $46$ mmHg to $58$ mmHg. This significant rise in intracapillary hydrostatic pressure is a primary driver of glomerular injury via two main mechanisms:\n\na. **Hyperfiltration**: The single-nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) is driven by the net ultrafiltration pressure ($P_{UF}$), which is principally determined by $P_{GC}$. The substantial increase in $P_{GC}$ elevates $P_{UF}$, causing an pathological increase in SNGFR. This state, known as hyperfiltration, reflects a condition of glomerular overwork.\n\nb. **Structural Barotrauma**: The increased hydrostatic pressure, $P_{GC}$, exerts a greater physical force on the walls of the glomerular capillaries. According to the Law of Laplace, which relates wall tension ($T$) to pressure ($P$) and radius ($r$), this elevated pressure increases the tension on the delicate components of the filtration barrier (the endothelium, glomerular basement membrane, and podocytes). This chronic mechanical stress, or barotrauma, can lead to structural damage, including podocyte detachment, GBM thickening, and mesangial expansion, which culminate in glomerulosclerosis and a progressive decline in renal function.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12}$$", "id": "4786640"}, {"introduction": "Glomerular injury often involves multiple, sometimes opposing, functional changes.

Sieving Coefficient for IgG ($\\theta_{G, \\text{inj}}$)**\nIgG properties are $a_G = 5.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and $z_G = -7$.\n\n**3.1. Contribution from Injured Small Pores ($\\theta_{G,s,\\text{inj}}$):**\n- The ratio of solute radius to pore radius is $\\lambda_{G,s} = \\dfrac{a_G}{a_{s, \\text{inj}}} = \\dfrac{5.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{3.42\\,\\mathrm{nm}} \\approx 1.608$.\n- Since $\\lambda_{G,s}  1$, IgG is completely excluded from the injured small pores.\n- Therefore, $\\phi_{G,s} = 0$, $K_{c,G,s} = 0$, and $\\theta_{G,s,\\text{inj}} = 0$.\n\n**3.2. Contribution from Large Pores ($\\theta_{G,\\ell,\\text{inj}}$):**\n- The ratio of solute radius to pore radius is $\\lambda_{G,\\ell} = \\dfrac{a_G}{a_{\\ell}} = \\dfrac{5.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{11\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = 0.5$.\n- Since $\\lambda_{G,\\ell}  1$, we calculate the factors:\n- Steric partition coefficient: $\\phi_{G,\\ell} = (1 - \\lambda_{G,\\ell})^2 = (1 - 0.5)^2 = 0.25$.\n- Convective hindrance factor: $K_{c,G,\\ell} = 1 - 2.104\\,\\lambda_{G,\\ell} + 2.09\\,\\lambda_{G,\\ell}^{3} - 0.95\\,\\lambda_{G,\\ell}^{5}$.\n  $K_{c,G,\\ell} = 1 - 2.104(0.5) + 2.09(0.5)^3 - 0.95(0.5)^5 = 1 - 1.052 + 0.26125 - 0.0296875 = 0.1795625$.\n- Electrostatic partition factor: $E_{G,\\ell} = \\exp\\left(- z_G \\dfrac{F\\,\\psi_{D, \\text{inj}}}{R T}\\right) = \\exp(-(-7) \\times (-0.131086)) = \\exp(-0.91760) \\approx 0.39947$.\n- The sieving coefficient for IgG through large pores is: $\\theta_{G,\\ell,\\text{inj}} = E_{G,\\ell}\\,\\phi_{G,\\ell}\\,K_{c,G,\\ell} \\approx (0.39947)(0.25)(0.1795625) \\approx 0.01793$.\n\n**3.3. Overall IgG Sieving Coefficient:**\n- $\\theta_{G, \\text{inj}} = f_{s}\\,\\theta_{G,s,\\text{inj}} + f_{\\ell}\\,\\theta_{G,\\ell,\\text{inj}} = (0.98)(0) + (0.02)(0.01793) = 0.0003586$.\n- Rounded to three significant figures, $\\theta_{G, \\text{inj}} \\approx 3.59 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n\n**4. Interpretation of Changes in Selectivity**\nThe glomerular injury has altered both size and charge selectivity.\n- **Size Selectivity:** The restriction of the small pores from $a_{s0} = 3.8\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ to $a_{s, \\text{inj}} = 3.42\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ increases size selectivity. This is evident for albumin ($a_A = 3.6\\,\\mathrm{nm}$), which was previously able to pass (albeit with high restriction) but is now completely excluded from the small-pore pathway. For IgG ($a_G = 5.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$), which was already too large for the small pores, this change has no effect. As transport of both macromolecules is dominated by the large-pore pathway, this change in small pores has a minor overall effect.\n- **Charge Selectivity:** The reduction of the Donnan potential's magnitude from $\\psi_{D0} = -5.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to $\\psi_{D, \\text{inj}} = -3.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ represents a loss of fixed negative charge in the barrier. This *decreases* charge selectivity, weakening the electrostatic repulsion for anionic proteins like albumin and IgG.\n- **Relative Impact:** The sieving coefficient of both proteins increases, indicating a leakier barrier. For albumin, $\\theta_A$ increases from a healthy-state value of approximately $1.23 \\times 10^{-4}$ to the injured value of $3.26 \\times 10^{-4}$, a factor of $\\sim 2.65$ increase. For IgG, $\\theta_G$ increases from a healthy-state value of approximately $2.42 \\times 10^{-4}$ to $3.59 \\times 10^{-4}$, a more modest factor of $\\sim 1.48$ increase. The loss of charge selectivity has a disproportionately large effect on albumin due to its higher effective negative valence ($z_A = -18$) compared to IgG ($z_G = -7$). The dominant effect of the injury is the loss of charge selectivity in the large-pore pathway, which dramatically increases the passage of albumin, more so than IgG. Consequently, the barrier's ability to selectively retain albumin over IgG is compromised.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3.26 \\times 10^{-4}  3.59 \\times 10^{-4} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4786770"}]}
