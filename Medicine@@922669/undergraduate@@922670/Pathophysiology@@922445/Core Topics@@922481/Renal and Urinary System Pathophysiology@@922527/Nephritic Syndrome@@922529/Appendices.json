In this state, both the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) decline due to combined effects on filtration and renal hemodynamics.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. All necessary data are provided, and the physiological context is accurate. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for four distinct items: a definition of the filtration fraction ($FF$), a derivation of its formula, the calculation of $FF$ in two different physiological states, and the multiplicative change between these two states.\n\nFirst, we address the definition of filtration fraction ($FF$). In renal physiology, the renal plasma flow ($RPF$) is the volume of blood plasma that enters the glomeruli of the kidneys per unit time. The glomerular filtration rate ($GFR$) is the volume of fluid that is filtered out of the plasma from the glomerular capillaries into Bowman's capsule per unit time. The filtration fraction ($FF$) is defined as the proportion of the plasma entering the glomeruli that is successfully filtered. It represents the efficiency of glomerular filtration relative to the total plasma flow reaching the filtration barrier.\n\nSecond, we derive the general expression for $FF$. Based on its definition, the filtration fraction is simply the ratio of the rate of filtration to the rate of plasma flow into the glomerulus. Let $GFR$ denote the glomerular filtration rate and $RPF$ denote the renal plasma flow. Both are volumetric flow rates, typically measured in units of volume per time (e.g., mL/min). The filtration fraction, $FF$, is a dimensionless quantity given by the ratio:\n$$FF = \\frac{GFR}{RPF}$$\nThis equation is derived directly from the fundamental definitions of the involved quantities and the principle of conservation of flow applied to the filtration process.\n\nThird, we compute the filtration fraction for the two specified states: baseline and nephritic.\n\nFor the baseline state, the given values are:\n$GFR_{\\text{baseline}} = 110 \\text{ mL/min}$\n$RPF_{\\text{baseline}} = 600 \\text{ mL/min}$\n\nUsing the derived formula, the baseline filtration fraction, $FF_{\\text{baseline}}$, is:\n$$FF_{\\text{baseline}} = \\frac{GFR_{\\text{baseline}}}{RPF_{\\text{baseline}}} = \\frac{110}{600} = \\frac{11}{60}$$\n\nFor the nephritic state, the given values are:\n$GFR_{\\text{nephritic}} = 55 \\text{ mL/min}$\n$RPF_{\\text{nephritic}} = 400 \\text{ mL/min}$\n\nThe nephritic filtration fraction, $FF_{\\text{nephritic}}$, is:\n$$FF_{\\text{nephritic}} = \\frac{GFR_{\\text{nephritic}}}{RPF_{\\text{nephritic}}} = \\frac{55}{400} = \\frac{11 \\times 5}{80 \\times 5} = \\frac{11}{80}$$\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the multiplicative change in $FF$, defined as the ratio of the nephritic $FF$ to the baseline $FF$.\n$$\\text{Multiplicative Change} = \\frac{FF_{\\text{nephritic}}}{FF_{\\text{baseline}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $FF_{\\text{nephritic}}$ and $FF_{\\text{baseline}}$:\n$$\\frac{FF_{\\text{nephritic}}}{FF_{\\text{baseline}}} = \\frac{\\frac{11}{80}}{\\frac{11}{60}}$$\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator:\n$$\\frac{FF_{\\text{nephritic}}}{FF_{\\text{baseline}}} = \\frac{11}{80} \\times \\frac{60}{11}$$\nThe term $11$ cancels out from the numerator and the denominator, leaving:\n$$\\frac{FF_{\\text{nephritic}}}{FF_{\\text{baseline}}} = \\frac{60}{80}$$\nThis fraction simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{60}{80} = \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction.\n$$\\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$$\nThis result indicates that the filtration fraction in the nephritic state is $75\\%$ of the filtration fraction in the baseline state. This is an interesting physiological result, as both $GFR$ and $RPF$ decreased, but not proportionally. $GFR$ decreased by $50\\%$, while RPF decreased by only $33.3\\%$, leading to a net decrease in the filtration fraction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.75}$$", "id": "4811096"}, {"introduction": "The primary drop in $GFR$ during nephritic syndrome triggers a powerful secondary response: the avid retention of sodium and water, leading to the classic clinical signs of edema and hypertension.

By deriving the formula for $FENa$ and applying it to a clinical scenario [@problem_id:4811026], you will develop the skill to interpret this key value and understand the pathophysiology behind the paradoxical sodium retention that drives the volume-overloaded state of nephritic syndrome.", "problem": "A hospitalized adult with clinical features of nephritic syndrome presents with periorbital edema, new-onset hypertension, and cola-colored urine.

Express the final result as a unitless decimal fraction and round to three significant figures. In your reasoning, interpret whether the calculated value is consistent with avid sodium retention expected in nephritic pathophysiology, but report only the numeric value as your final answer.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in renal pathophysiology, well-posed with all necessary data for a unique solution, and presented in an objective, clinical manner.\n\nThe task is to derive an expression for the fractional excretion of sodium ($FENa$) and calculate its value for the given patient. We begin with the fundamental definitions from renal physiology.\n\nThe excretion rate of a substance $X$, denoted as $E_X$, is the amount of the substance excreted in the urine per unit time. It is the product of the urine flow rate, $V$, and the urinary concentration of the substance, $U_X$.\n$$E_X = V \\times U_X$$\n\nThe filtered load of a freely filtered substance $X$, denoted as $L_X$, is the amount of the substance filtered across the glomerulus into Bowman's space per unit time. It is the product of the glomerular filtration rate, $GFR$, and the plasma concentration of the substance, $P_X$.\n$$L_X = GFR \\times P_X$$\n\nThe fractional excretion of sodium, $FENa$, is defined as the ratio of the amount of sodium excreted to the amount of sodium filtered. It represents the fraction of the filtered sodium that reaches the final urine.\n$$FENa = \\frac{\\text{Sodium Excreted}}{\\text{Sodium Filtered}} = \\frac{E_{Na}}{L_{Na}}$$\n\nSubstituting the definitions for excretion rate and filtered load of sodium ($Na$) into this equation, we get:\n$$FENa = \\frac{V \\times U_{Na}}{GFR \\times P_{Na}}$$\n\nTo proceed, we need an estimate for the $GFR$. The problem states that we should assume creatinine clearance, $C_{Cr}$, approximates the $GFR$. The renal clearance of any substance is defined as its excretion rate divided by its plasma concentration. Thus, for creatinine ($Cr$):\n$$C_{Cr} = \\frac{E_{Cr}}{P_{Cr}} = \\frac{V \\times U_{Cr}}{P_{Cr}}$$\n\nUsing the given assumption, $GFR \\approx C_{Cr}$, we have:\n$$GFR \\approx \\frac{V \\times U_{Cr}}{P_{Cr}}$$\n\nNow we substitute this expression for $GFR$ into the equation for $FENa$:\n$$FENa \\approx \\frac{V \\times U_{Na}}{\\left( \\frac{V \\times U_{Cr}}{P_{Cr}} \\right) \\times P_{Na}}$$\n\nThe urine flow rate, $V$, appears in both the numerator and the denominator, allowing it to be cancelled. This is a critical simplification, as it means $FENa$ can be calculated from a spot urine sample without needing a timed urine collection to determine $V$.\n$$FENa \\approx \\frac{U_{Na}}{\\frac{U_{Cr} \\times P_{Na}}{P_{Cr}}}$$\n\nBy rearranging the terms, we arrive at the standard formula for the fractional excretion of sodium:\n$$FENa = \\frac{U_{Na} \\times P_{Cr}}{P_{Na} \\times U_{Cr}}$$\n\nNow we can compute the value for this patient using the provided data:\n- Urine sodium concentration, $U_{Na} = 10 \\text{ mEq/L}$\n- Plasma sodium concentration, $P_{Na} = 140 \\text{ mEq/L}$\n- Urine creatinine concentration, $U_{Cr} = 50 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n- Plasma creatinine concentration, $P_{Cr} = 2.8 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$FENa = \\frac{(10 \\text{ mEq/L}) \\times (2.8 \\text{ mg/dL})}{(140 \\text{ mEq/L}) \\times (50 \\text{ mg/dL})}$$\n\nThe units for sodium concentration ($mEq/L$) and creatinine concentration ($mg/dL$) cancel out, yielding a dimensionless quantity as expected for a fractional excretion.\n$$FENa = \\frac{10 \\times 2.8}{140 \\times 50} = \\frac{28}{7000}$$\n\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$FENa = \\frac{4 \\times 7}{1000 \\times 7} = \\frac{4}{1000} = 0.004$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be expressed as a unitless decimal fraction rounded to three significant figures.\n$$FENa = 0.00400$$\n\nThis calculated value of $FENa = 0.004$, which is equivalent to $0.4\\%$, is less than $1\\%$. In renal pathophysiology, a low $FENa$ (less than $1\\%$) is indicative of avid sodium reabsorption by the renal tubules. This is characteristic of a 'pre-renal' state, where the kidneys perceive a decrease in effective circulating volume and respond by conserving sodium and water. In the context of nephritic syndrome, the primary insult is glomerular inflammation, which leads to a decreased $GFR$. This primary reduction in filtration is sensed by the renal tubules as hypoperfusion, triggering a robust, secondary tubular reabsorptive response, primarily mediated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Despite the patient's clinical state of volume expansion (edema, hypertension), the kidneys are avidly retaining sodium. This calculated low $FENa$ is therefore entirely consistent with the expected pathophysiology of nephritic syndrome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.00400}$$", "id": "4811026"}, {"introduction": "Nephritic syndrome is not a single disease but a clinical presentation with a broad differential diagnosis, ranging from post-infectious causes to systemic autoimmune diseases.

However, hematuria can be non-glomerular. The first principle states that dysmorphic RBCs and RBC casts are the hallmark of a *glomerular* source of bleeding. Therefore, the most logical first step is to perform urine microscopy to confirm or refute the glomerular origin. If the source is non-glomerular (isomorphic RBCs, no casts), the patient should be triaged towards a different diagnostic pathway (e.g., urology).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Stratify by Underlying Immune Mechanism.** After confirming glomerular disease, the next logical step is to differentiate between the major pathophysiological categories. The second principle provides a powerful tool for this: complement levels.\n    -   Low complement ($C_3$ and/or $C_4$ depression) points towards **immune-complex mediated glomerulonephritis**.\n    -   Normal complement levels point towards **pauci-immune glomerulonephritis**, **anti-GBM disease**, or **IgA nephropathy**.\n    This stratification is highly efficient as it splits the differential diagnosis into two manageable branches, guiding subsequent, more specific testing.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Use Specific Serologies to Identify Etiology within Each Branch.**\n    -   **Step 3a (Low Complement Branch):** The candidate diseases are post-infectious GN, lupus nephritis, and MPGN. The specific serologies listed are designed to distinguish these:\n        -   **Lupus Nephritis:** Characterized by ANA/anti-dsDNA positivity and typically low $C_3$ and $C_4$.\n        -   **Post-infectious GN (e.g., post-streptococcal):** Characterized by elevated ASO and predominantly low $C_3$.\n        -   **MPGN:** Often associated with low $C_3$ and can be linked to chronic infections like HBV and HCV.\n        Therefore, in the low complement pathway, ordering ANA/anti-dsDNA, ASO, and HBV/HCV tests is the correct approach.\n\n    -   **Step 3b (Normal Complement Branch):** The candidate diseases are ANCA-associated vasculitis, anti-GBM disease, and IgA nephropathy. The specific serologies are:\n        -   **ANCA-associated Vasculitis:** Characterized by ANCA positivity.\n        -   **Anti-GBM Disease:** Characterized by anti-GBM antibody positivity.\n        -   **IgA Nephropathy:** This is a diagnosis of exclusion in this context, often presenting with normal complement and negative ANCA/anti-GBM serologies. An elevated serum IgA and a history of synpharyngitic hematuria would increase suspicion.\n        Therefore, in the normal complement pathway, ordering ANCA and anti-GBM tests is the correct approach. If negative, IgA nephropathy is a primary consideration.\n\nThis three-step, hierarchical approach is the most pathophysiologically sound and efficient way to use the available tests.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis:**\n\n**A.**\n-   Step $1$: Use urine microscopy to distinguish glomerular (dysmorphic RBCs/casts) from non-glomerular hematuria. This aligns perfectly with the first principle and our derived Step $1$.\n-   Step $2$: If glomerular, measure complement ($C_3$, $C_4$) to branch into low complement (immune-complex) and normal complement (pauci-immune/anti-GBM/IgA) pathways. This aligns perfectly with the second principle and our derived Step $2$.\n-   Step $3a$ (low complement): Order the appropriate serologies for immune-complex diseases (ANA/anti-dsDNA, HBV/HCV, ASO). This aligns perfectly with the third principle and our derived Step $3a$.\n-   Step $3b$ (normal complement): Order the appropriate serologies for pauci-immune/anti-GBM diseases (ANCA, anti-GBM) and consider IgA nephropathy if negative. This aligns perfectly with the third principle and our derived Step $3b$.\n-   **Verdict:** This option precisely follows the logical, hierarchical diagnostic algorithm derived from the fundamental principles provided. **Correct**.\n\n**B.**\n-   Step $1$: Measure $C_3$ and $C_4$ first. This is an inefficient first step as it does not confirm the presence of glomerular disease. More critically, it inverts the subsequent logic: it suggests testing for pauci-immune diseases (ANCA, anti-GBM) if complement is low, and for immune-complex diseases (ANA, ASO, etc.) if complement is normal. This directly contradicts the principles of complement consumption.\n-   Step $2$: It demotes urine microscopy to a confirmatory test, undermining its primary role in localizing the problem to the glomerulus.\n-   **Verdict:** This option is logically and pathophysiologically flawed. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C.**\n-   Step $1$: Correctly starts with urine microscopy.\n-   Step $2$: It explicitly recommends skipping complement testing, claiming it is \"nonspecific.\" This directly violates the second fundamental principle provided, which establishes complement level as a key differentiator between major categories of glomerulonephritis. The proposed \"shotgun\" approach of ordering all serologies at once is inefficient and negates the purpose of a structured decision tree.\n-   Step $3$: The interpretations are oversimplified and ignore the diagnostic power of complement levels, which can help resolve ambiguous cases.\n-   **Verdict:** This option discards a crucial piece of pathophysiological information and advocates for an inefficient testing strategy. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.**\n-   Step $1$ and Step $2$: Correctly proposes urine microscopy followed by complement measurement.\n-   Step $3a$ (low complement): This step contains major factual errors based on the problem's own premises. It associates MPGN with ANCA positivity and suggests anti-GBM disease in the low complement arm. ANCA is a marker for pauci-immune (normal complement) disease, and anti-GBM disease is also typically normal complement.\n-   Step $3b$ (normal complement): This step also contains major factual errors. It places post-streptococcal GN (a classic low-complement disease) and lupus nephritis (classically a low-complement disease) in the normal complement branch.\n-   **Verdict:** This option correctly starts the algorithm but then completely misattributes the diseases and their serologic markers to the incorrect complement pathways. It demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the provided principles. **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option A is the only one that represents a coherent, efficient, and pathophysiologically sound application of the given principles and tests.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4811018"}]}
