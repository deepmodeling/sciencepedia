A unique and meaningful solution can be derived from the provided information.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part response: the derivation of an expression for the fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa), the calculation of FeNa for the given patient data, and the pathophysiological interpretation of the result.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the FeNa Expression**\n\nThe fractional excretion of sodium, $FeNa$, is defined as the fraction of the sodium filtered by the glomeruli that is ultimately excreted in the urine. This can be expressed as the ratio of the rate of sodium excretion to the rate of sodium filtration:\n$$ FeNa = \\frac{\\text{Sodium Excreted}}{\\text{Sodium Filtered}} $$\n\nWe will formalize the numerator and denominator using the provided foundational facts.\n\nLet $U_{Na}$ be the urine sodium concentration and $P_{Na}$ be the plasma sodium concentration.\nLet $V$ be the urine flow rate.\n\nAccording to the first principle provided, the excreted load (or rate of excretion) of a solute equals its urine concentration multiplied by the urine flow rate. For sodium, this is:\n$$ \\text{Sodium Excreted} = U_{Na} \\times V $$\n\nAccording to the second principle, the filtered load of a freely filtered solute equals the glomerular filtration rate ($GFR$) multiplied by its plasma concentration. Sodium is freely filtered. Therefore:\n$$ \\text{Sodium Filtered} = P_{Na} \\times GFR $$\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the definition of $FeNa$:\n$$ FeNa = \\frac{U_{Na} \\times V}{P_{Na} \\times GFR} $$\n\nThe urine flow rate $V$ and the $GFR$ are not directly provided. However, the third principle states that in a steady state, $GFR$ can be approximated by the clearance of creatinine ($C_{Cr}$), as creatinine is freely filtered and undergoes negligible tubular secretion or reabsorption.\n\nThe clearance of any substance $x$ is defined as the volume of plasma from which the substance is completely removed per unit time. It is calculated as:\n$$ C_x = \\frac{U_x \\times V}{P_x} $$\nwhere $U_x$ is the urine concentration and $P_x$ is the plasma concentration of the substance.\n\nApplying this definition to creatinine, with $U_{Cr}$ as the urine creatinine concentration and $P_{Cr}$ as the plasma creatinine concentration, we get the creatinine clearance:\n$$ C_{Cr} = \\frac{U_{Cr} \\times V}{P_{Cr}} $$\n\nUsing the approximation $GFR \\approx C_{Cr}$, we can write:\n$$ GFR \\approx \\frac{U_{Cr} \\times V}{P_{Cr}} $$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $GFR$ into our equation for $FeNa$:\n$$ FeNa = \\frac{U_{Na} \\times V}{P_{Na} \\times \\left( \\frac{U_{Cr} \\times V}{P_{Cr}} \\right)} $$\n\nThe urine flow rate, $V$, appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it can be canceled out:\n$$ FeNa = \\frac{U_{Na}}{P_{Na} \\times \\left( \\frac{U_{Cr}}{P_{Cr}} \\right)} $$\n\nRearranging this expression gives the final, practical formula for $FeNa$:\n$$ FeNa = \\frac{U_{Na} \\times P_{Cr}}{P_{Na} \\times U_{Cr}} $$\n\nThis derived expression relates the four provided laboratory values ($U_{Na}$, $P_{Na}$, $U_{Cr}$, and $P_{Cr}$) and allows for the calculation of $FeNa$ from a single spot urine sample and a contemporaneous blood sample, without needing a timed urine collection to measure $V$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of FeNa**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Plasma sodium concentration: $P_{Na} = 142 \\text{ mmol/L}$\n- Urine sodium concentration: $U_{Na} = 8 \\text{ mmol/L}$\n- Plasma creatinine concentration: $P_{Cr} = 2.1 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n- Urine creatinine concentration: $U_{Cr} = 98 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n\nUsing the derived formula:\n$$ FeNa = \\frac{U_{Na} \\times P_{Cr}}{P_{Na} \\times U_{Cr}} $$\n\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ FeNa = \\frac{(8 \\text{ mmol/L}) \\times (2.1 \\text{ mg/dL})}{(142 \\text{ mmol/L}) \\times (98 \\text{ mg/dL})} $$\n\nThe units (mmol/L and mg/dL) cancel, yielding a dimensionless number as expected for a fraction.\n$$ FeNa = \\frac{16.8}{13916} \\approx 0.00120724346... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant digits are $1$, $2$, and $0$. The fourth significant digit is $7$, which is $\\ge 5$, so we round up the third significant digit.\n$$ FeNa \\approx 0.00121 $$\n\n**Part 3: Pathophysiologic Interpretation**\n\nThe fractional excretion of sodium is a critical tool for differentiating between the major categories of acute kidney injury (AKI), specifically between prerenal azotemia and intrinsic AKI, particularly acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The interpretation relies on understanding the kidney's physiological response to different insults.\n\nEstablished clinical thresholds for $FeNa$ (expressed as a percentage) are:\n- $FeNa  1\\%$ (or as a fraction, $FeNa  0.01$): This is characteristic of **prerenal azotemia**. In prerenal states, such as hypovolemia from gastrointestinal losses, renal perfusion is decreased. The kidneys perceive this as a loss of effective circulating volume and activate compensatory mechanisms, primarily the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Aldosterone acts on the distal tubules and collecting ducts to increase the reabsorption of sodium (and water). The renal tubules are structurally and functionally intact, and their avid reabsorption of sodium leads to a very low concentration of sodium in the urine relative to the amount filtered.\n- $FeNa > 2\\%$ (or as a fraction, $FeNa > 0.02$): This is characteristic of **intrinsic AKI**, most commonly acute tubular necrosis (ATN). In ATN, the tubular epithelial cells are damaged. This damage impairs their ability to reabsorb solutes, including sodium. Consequently, a larger fraction of the filtered sodium is \"wasted\" into the urine, leading to a high $FeNa$.\n\nThe calculated $FeNa$ for this patient is $0.00121$.\nTo compare this with the standard thresholds, we can express it as a percentage: $0.00121 \\times 100\\% = 0.121\\%$.\n\nThis value of $0.121\\%$ is significantly less than the $1\\%$ threshold. This very low $FeNa$ indicates that the renal tubules are aggressively conserving sodium, a hallmark of an intact tubular system responding to perceived volume depletion. This finding is highly consistent with the clinical history of acute kidney injury developing after gastrointestinal fluid losses.\n\nTherefore, the likely mechanism of AKI in this patient is **prerenal azotemia** secondary to hypovolemia. The kidney itself is not damaged; its function is impaired due to inadequate perfusion. This distinction is crucial as prerenal AKI is often reversible with restoration of fluid volume, whereas intrinsic AKI represents structural damage to the kidney parenchyma. The provided data strongly suggest the former case. It is important to note that these thresholds are most reliable in patients who have not received diuretics, a condition specified in the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.00121}$$", "id": "4759838"}, {"introduction": "Once AKI is detected, quantifying its severity is essential for guiding management and assessing prognosis.

The severity is assessed by the fold-increase in creatinine from baseline $C_0 = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n\nThe true fold-increase, $F_{\\text{true}}$, is based on the undiluted creatinine level:\n$$F_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{true}, 24h}}}{C_0} = \\frac{2.0\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}}{1.0\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}} = 2.0$$\n\nThe measured fold-increase, $F_{\\text{measured}}$, is based on the diluted, measured creatinine level:\n$$F_{\\text{measured}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{measured}, 24h}}}{C_0} = \\frac{\\frac{42}{23}\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}}{1.0\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}} = \\frac{42}{23} \\approx 1.8260869...$$\n\nThe fractional underestimation, $u$, is defined as:\n$$u = \\frac{F_{\\text{true}} - F_{\\text{measured}}}{F_{\\text{true}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $F_{\\text{true}}$ and $F_{\\text{measured}}$:\n$$u = \\frac{\\frac{C_{\\text{true}, 24h}}}{C_0} - \\frac{C_{\\text{measured}, 24h}}}{C_0}}{\\frac{C_{\\text{true}, 24h}}}{C_0}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{true}, 24h}} - C_{\\text{measured}, 24h}}}{C_{\\text{true}, 24h}}} = 1 - \\frac{C_{\\text{measured}, 24h}}}{C_{\\text{true}, 24h}}}$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $C_{\\text{measured}, 24h}}$:\n$$u = 1 - \\frac{\\frac{C_{\\text{true}, 24h}} \\times V_0}{V_0 + \\Delta V}}{C_{\\text{true}, 24h}}}} = 1 - \\frac{V_0}{V_0 + \\Delta V}$$\n$$u = \\frac{(V_0 + \\Delta V) - V_0}{V_0 + \\Delta V} = \\frac{\\Delta V}{V_0 + \\Delta V}$$\nThis elegant result shows that the fractional underestimation of the fold-increase depends only on the initial volume of distribution and the added fluid volume.\n\nPlugging in the values for $\\Delta V$ and $V_0$:\n$$u = \\frac{4\\ \\mathrm{L}}{42\\ \\mathrm{L} + 4\\ \\mathrm{L}} = \\frac{4}{46} = \\frac{2}{23}$$\n$$u \\approx 0.0869565...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$u = 0.08696$$\n\nThe final answer is the ordered pair $(C_{\\text{measured}, 24h}},\\ u)$.\nThe calculated values are $C_{\\text{measured}, 24h}} = 1.826\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$ and $u = 0.08696$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1.826  0.08696 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4759868"}]}
