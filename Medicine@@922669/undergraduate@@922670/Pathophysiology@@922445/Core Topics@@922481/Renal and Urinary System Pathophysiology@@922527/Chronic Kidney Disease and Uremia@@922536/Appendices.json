This practice guides you through applying the internationally recognized Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, which provide a robust framework for staging CKD based on glomerular filtration rate ($G$ categories) and albuminuria ($A$ categories). By working through this scenario, you will develop the essential skill of translating clinical data into a formal diagnosis and risk assessment, a cornerstone of modern nephrology.", "problem": "A patient presents with a sustained reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and elevated urine albumin excretion. Using established Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification principles, derive the chronic kidney disease classification and risk tier from first principles as follows.\n\nStart from the following foundational definitions and observations:\n- Chronic kidney disease is defined by either a persistently reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below $60$ milliliters per minute per $1.73$ square meters for at least $3$ months, or markers of kidney damage such as increased urine albumin excretion. Specifically, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) of at least $30$ milligrams per gram sustained for at least $3$ months satisfies the kidney damage criterion.\n- The KDIGO glomerular filtration rate categories are: $G1$ ($\\geq 90$), $G2$ ($60$ to $89$), $G3a$ ($45$ to $59$), $G3b$ ($30$ to $44$), $G4$ ($15$ to $29$), and $G5$ ($< 15$), all in milliliters per minute per $1.73$ square meters.\n- The KDIGO albuminuria categories are: $A1$ ($< 30$ milligrams per gram), $A2$ ($30$ to $300$ milligrams per gram), and $A3$ ($> 300$ milligrams per gram).\n- The KDIGO risk grid stratifies the risk of chronic kidney disease progression and cardiovascular disease across the $G$ and $A$ categories into four ordinal tiers: low risk, moderately increased risk, high risk, and very high risk, with increasing risk as either eGFR declines or albuminuria increases.\n\nGiven the patient has $eGFR = 38$ milliliters per minute per $1.73$ square meters persisting for $4$ months and $uACR = 120$ milligrams per gram, use the above definitions to:\n1. Determine the glomerular filtration rate category $Gx$ and albuminuria category $Ay$.\n2. Infer the associated KDIGO risk tier for both chronic kidney disease progression and cardiovascular disease from the risk grid for the $(Gx, Ay)$ cell.\n\nTo yield a single numerical final answer, encode the risk tier using the following ordinal numeric mapping based on KDIGO descriptors: low risk $\\mapsto 1$, moderately increased risk $\\mapsto 2$, high risk $\\mapsto 3$, very high risk $\\mapsto 4$. Report the encoded risk tier as the final scalar value.\n\nExpress your final answer as a pure number. If rounding becomes necessary, round to four significant figures. No units are required in the final answer.", "solution": "The problem requires classification and risk stratification based on KDIGO definitions, then encoding the qualitative risk tier into a single scalar using a specified ordinal mapping. We proceed step by step from foundational definitions.\n\nFirst, we verify the presence of chronic kidney disease from core criteria. Chronic kidney disease is present if either $eGFR < 60$ milliliters per minute per $1.73$ square meters or $uACR \\geq 30$ milligrams per gram persists for at least $3$ months. The patient has $eGFR = 38$ milliliters per minute per $1.73$ square meters persisting for $4$ months and $uACR = 120$ milligrams per gram. Both the reduced eGFR and the increased uACR are sustained beyond $3$ months. Therefore, chronic kidney disease is established by definition.\n\nSecond, we classify the glomerular filtration rate category using the KDIGO $G$ categories. The value $eGFR = 38$ milliliters per minute per $1.73$ square meters lies in the interval $30$ to $44$, which corresponds to $G3b$ by definition.\n\nThird, we classify the albuminuria category using the KDIGO $A$ categories. The value $uACR = 120$ milligrams per gram lies in the interval $30$ to $300$, which corresponds to $A2$ by definition.\n\nFourth, we determine the KDIGO risk tier for the cell $(G3b, A2)$. The KDIGO risk grid is a matrix stratifying risk across eGFR categories ($G1$ to $G5$) and albuminuria categories ($A1$ to $A3$), with risk increasing as either eGFR declines or albuminuria increases. For $G3b$ combined with $A2$, the grid indicates a high risk tier for both chronic kidney disease progression and cardiovascular disease. Intuitively, $G3b$ denotes a moderate-to-severe decrease in glomerular filtration rate, and $A2$ denotes moderately increased albuminuria; together, these confer a high likelihood of progressive nephron loss and heightened cardiovascular risk due to systemic endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and fluid-electrolyte perturbations typical of uremia.\n\nFinally, we encode the qualitative risk tier using the prescribed ordinal mapping. High risk is mapped to the scalar value $3$. Therefore, the encoded KDIGO risk tier for this patient is $3$.\n\nNo rounding is required because the mapping produces an exact integer. The final answer is reported as a pure number without units, as instructed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "4775095"}, {"introduction": "Chronic kidney disease profoundly disrupts mineral and bone metabolism, leading to a dangerous complication known as extra-skeletal calcification. This exercise focuses on a key clinical metric, the calcium-phosphate product, which serves as a practical indicator of the risk for calcium phosphate precipitation in soft tissues.

Since the kidneys are a primary route for drug elimination, uremia necessitates a careful recalculation of treatment regimens based on pharmacokinetic principles.

Due to reduced renal function, gentamicin clearance is primarily governed by glomerular filtration and is provided as a measured total body clearance of $25$ mL/min. Assume a one-compartment, well-mixed body model with first-order elimination, and an apparent volume of distribution of $0.25$ L/kg for gentamicin in this patient. The therapeutic plan is to administer gentamicin as an intravenous bolus to achieve a peak plasma concentration of $8$ mg/L immediately post-distribution, and to minimize toxicity by allowing the concentration to decline to a trough of $1.0$ mg/L immediately before the next dose.\n\nUsing only well-established pharmacokinetic principles appropriate to the one-compartment, first-order elimination model, determine:\n- The initial gentamicin dose required to achieve the stated peak, given the specified volume of distribution.\n- The dosing interval that will allow the plasma concentration to fall from the peak of $8$ mg/L to the trough of $1.0$ mg/L, given the stated clearance and volume of distribution.\n\nReport the dose in mg and the dosing interval in hours.

The solution is a two-part process.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Initial Dose ($D$)**\n\nThe initial dose required to achieve a target peak concentration ($C_{\\text{peak}}$) after an intravenous bolus is determined by the drug's apparent volume of distribution ($V_d$). The governing equation is:\n$$D = C_{\\text{peak}} \\times V_d$$\nFirst, we must calculate the patient's total volume of distribution from the specific volume of distribution ($0.25$ L/kg) and their body mass ($80$ kg):\n$$V_d = 0.25 \\, \\text{L/kg} \\times 80 \\, \\text{kg} = 20 \\, \\text{L}$$\nNow, we can calculate the dose using the target peak concentration ($C_{\\text{peak}} = 8$ mg/L):\n$$D = 8 \\, \\text{mg/L} \\times 20 \\, \\text{L} = 160 \\, \\text{mg}$$\nThe required initial dose is $160$ mg. Rounded to three significant figures, this is $160$ mg.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Dosing Interval ($\\tau$)**\n\nThe dosing interval is the time required for the plasma concentration to decay from the peak ($C_{\\text{peak}}$) to the trough ($C_{\\text{trough}}$). For a first-order elimination process, this is described by:\n$$C_{\\text{trough}} = C_{\\text{peak}} \\exp(-k_e \\tau)$$\nwhere $k_e$ is the elimination rate constant. We can solve for the dosing interval $\\tau$:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{1}{k_e} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{\\text{peak}}}{C_{\\text{trough}}}\\right)$$\nFirst, we must find $k_e$ from the total body clearance ($Cl$) and volume of distribution ($V_d$):\n$$k_e = \\frac{Cl}{V_d}$$\nThe clearance is given as $Cl = 25$ mL/min.
