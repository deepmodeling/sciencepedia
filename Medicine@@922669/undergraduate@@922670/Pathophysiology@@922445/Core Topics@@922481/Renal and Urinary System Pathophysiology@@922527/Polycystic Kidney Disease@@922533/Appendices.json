In the somatic second-hit model of cyst initiation, a focal tubular epithelial cell can initiate a cyst when a subsequent somatic event (e.g., a mutation or loss of heterozygosity (LOH)) functionally inactivates the remaining wild-type allele. Consider a single tubular epithelial cell lineage that undergoes $N=10^{6}$ mitotic divisions over time. Suppose the per-division probability of a somatic second hit that inactivates the wild-type allele is $\\mu=1\\times 10^{-7}$, and assume independence of divisions with a constant per-division risk across the lineage.\n\nUsing first principles of probability for independent Bernoulli trials, derive from the complement rule the probability $P$ that at least one effective second hit occurs somewhere in this lineage.

Finally, explain conceptually (not as part of the numerical answer) how this focal probability relates to mosaic cyst initiation in the context of a germline heterozygous $PKD1$ variant.", "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the accepted two-hit model of cystogenesis in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD), well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation. The problem asks for the derivation and calculation of a probability based on a series of independent Bernoulli trials and a conceptual explanation of the result in a biological context.\n\nThe problem can be modeled as a sequence of $N$ independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial corresponds to a single mitotic division of a cell in the lineage. A \"success\" is defined as the occurrence of a somatic second hit that inactivates the wild-type $PKD1$ allele. The probability of success in any single trial is given as $\\mu$.\n\nLet $S_i$ be the event of a second hit occurring during the $i$-th division, for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, N$.\nThe probability of this event is $P(S_i) = \\mu$.\nThe event that no second hit occurs during the $i$-th division is the complement event, denoted $S_i^c$. Its probability is $P(S_i^c) = 1 - \\mu$.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability $P$ that at least one effective second hit occurs somewhere in the lineage of $N$ divisions. This can be expressed as the probability of the union of all success events:\n$$P = P(S_1 \\cup S_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup S_N)$$\nCalculating this directly is cumbersome. It is more straightforward to use the complement rule, as requested by the problem. The complement of \"at least one hit\" is \"zero hits\".\nLet $A$ be the event that at least one hit occurs in $N$ divisions. The complement event, $A^c$, is that no hits occur in any of the $N$ divisions.\n$$P(A) = 1 - P(A^c)$$\nThe event $A^c$ corresponds to the intersection of the events where no hit occurred in each individual division:\n$$A^c = S_1^c \\cap S_2^c \\cap \\dots \\cap S_N^c$$\nSince the divisions are assumed to be independent events, the probability of the intersection is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$P(A^c) = P(S_1^c) \\times P(S_2^c) \\times \\dots \\times P(S_N^c) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} P(S_i^c)$$\nSince $P(S_i^c) = 1 - \\mu$ for all $i$, this simplifies to:\n$$P(A^c) = (1 - \\mu)^N$$\nSubstituting this back into the complement rule, we obtain the desired expression for $P$:\n$$P = 1 - (1 - \\mu)^N$$\nThis is the derived probability that at least one effective second hit occurs in the lineage.\n\nNow, we evaluate $P$ numerically using the given values:\nNumber of divisions, $N = 10^6$.\nPer-division probability of a second hit, $\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-7}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$P = 1 - (1 - 1 \\times 10^{-7})^{10^6}$$\n$$P = 1 - (1 - 0.0000001)^{1000000}$$\n$$P = 1 - (0.9999999)^{1000000}$$\nCalculating the value of the term $(0.9999999)^{1000000}$:\n$$(0.9999999)^{1000000} \\approx 0.90483736$$\nTherefore, the probability $P$ is:\n$$P \\approx 1 - 0.90483736 = 0.09516264$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $9$, $5$, $1$, and $6$. The fifth significant figure is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we do not round up.\n$$P \\approx 0.09516$$\n\nConceptually, this probability $P \\approx 0.09516$ (or about $9.5\\%$) represents the risk that a *single* tubular epithelial cell lineage, starting from a cell with a germline $PKD1$ mutation, will give rise to a cyst-initiating cell over the course of $10^6$ divisions. This risk for a single lineage is relatively low.\n\nHowever, the human kidney is composed of millions of renal tubules, each containing thousands of such epithelial cells. Each of these cells can be considered the progenitor of a distinct lineage, running an independent \"probabilistic experiment\". If there are, for example, $M$ such independent lineages in the kidneys, the probability that *at least one* of them initiates a cyst is $1 - (1-P)^M$. Given that $M$ is a very large number, this probability approaches $1$ (certainty), even though $P$ itself is small. This explains the high penetrance of the disease—why individuals with a germline $PKD1$ mutation almost invariably develop numerous cysts. The cysts arise from focal, sporadic second-hit events, meaning the kidney tissue becomes a \"mosaic\" of a vast majority of cells that are heterozygous at the $PKD1$ locus (one hit) and a small number of clonal cell populations that are functionally null for $PKD1$ (two hits) and which go on to form the cysts. This calculated focal probability is the fundamental unit of risk that, when scaled up to the level of the entire organ, accounts for the clinical phenotype of ADPKD.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.09516}$$", "id": "4801047"}, {"introduction": "Following a \"second hit,\" the loss of functional polycystin proteins disrupts crucial cellular signaling pathways.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe rate of change of the cytosolic calcium concentration, $C(t)$, is given by the net flux, which is the difference between the influx and efflux.

The magnitude of the reduction is $0.70 \\times g_{\\text{WT}}$. The resulting mutant conductance, $g_{\\text{mut}}$, is therefore:\n$$ g_{\\text{mut}} = g_{\\text{WT}} - 0.70 \\times g_{\\text{WT}} = (1 - 0.70) \\times g_{\\text{WT}} = 0.30 \\times g_{\\text{WT}} $$\nWe are given $g_{\\text{WT}} = 2.7 \\times 10^{-4}$ $\\text{s}^{-1}$.
