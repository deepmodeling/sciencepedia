Empirical observations indicate that retrograde menstruation is present in a large majority of menstruating individuals, whereas the disease prevalence remains substantially lower. Assume the following simplified, coarse-grained probabilistic model at the level of an individual:\n\n- Let $R$ be the event that retrograde menstruation occurs in the individual. The observed proportion is $P(R)=0.9$.\n- Let $I$ be the event that the immune system successfully clears the refluxed endometrial fragments such that implantation fails. Model immune clearance as a Bernoulli event with success probability $P(I)=p$, where $p$ is an unknown parameter representing immune clearance efficiency.\n- Let $D$ be the event that endometriosis develops. For this model, disease requires both the occurrence of retrograde menstruation and failure of immune clearance. Assume statistical independence between $R$ and $I$ at this coarse-grained level.\n- The observed disease prevalence is $P(D)=0.1$.\n\nStarting from the multiplication rule of probability for independent events and the definition that disease occurs if and only if retrograde menstruation occurs and immune clearance fails, derive an expression for the immune clearance efficiency parameter $p$ that reconciles the above observations.

The validation process confirms that the problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a self-contained and consistent set of definitions and data, allowing for a unique solution.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- $R$: The event of retrograde menstruation. The probability is given as $P(R) = 0.9$.\n- $I$: The event of successful immune clearance of refluxed endometrial fragments. The probability, representing the immune clearance efficiency, is $P(I) = p$.\n- $D$: The event that endometriosis develops. The prevalence is given as $P(D) = 0.1$.\n\nThe problem defines the condition for the development of endometriosis ($D$) as the co-occurrence of two events: retrograde menstruation ($R$) and the *failure* of immune clearance. The failure of immune clearance is the complement of the event $I$, denoted as $I^c$. The probability of immune clearance failure is therefore:\n$$P(I^c) = 1 - P(I) = 1 - p$$\n\nThe condition for disease development can be expressed as the intersection of events $R$ and $I^c$:\n$$D = R \\cap I^c$$\n\nThe problem states that the events $R$ and $I$ are to be considered statistically independent. A property of statistical independence is that if two events are independent, then their complements are also independent of each other, and each event is independent of the other's complement. Therefore, $R$ and $I^c$ are statistically independent.\n\nAccording to the multiplication rule for independent events, the probability of their intersection is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(D) = P(R \\cap I^c) = P(R) \\times P(I^c)$$\n\nWe are given the numerical values for $P(D)$ and $P(R)$. It is convenient to express these decimal values as exact fractions:\n$P(D) = 0.1 = \\frac{1}{10}$\n$P(R) = 0.9 = \\frac{9}{10}$\n\nSubstituting these values and the expression for $P(I^c)$ into the probability equation yields:\n$$\\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{9}{10} \\times (1 - p)$$\n\nOur objective is to solve this equation for the parameter $p$. First, we can divide both sides of the equation by $\\frac{9}{10}$:\n$$\\frac{\\frac{1}{10}}{\\frac{9}{10}} = 1 - p$$\n$$\\frac{1}{9} = 1 - p$$\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate $p$:\n$$p = 1 - \\frac{1}{9}$$\n\nTo compute the final value, we find a common denominator:\n$$p = \\frac{9}{9} - \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{8}{9}$$\n\nThus, the immune clearance efficiency parameter $p$ that reconciles the high incidence of retrograde menstruation with the lower prevalence of endometriosis, within this simplified model, is $\\frac{8}{9}$.

This total concentration is the sum of contributions from two sources: the ovarian systemic supply, $E_{\\text{ov},0}$, and the local production, $E_{\\text{loc},0}$.
