The solution process may proceed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe primary calculation is for the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI). The AHI is a standard clinical measure defined as the total number of apneas (both obstructive and central) and hypopneas that occur per hour of sleep. The formula is:\n$$\n\\text{AHI} = \\frac{\\text{Total Apneas} + \\text{Total Hypopneas}}{\\text{Total Sleep Time in hours}}\n$$\n\nLet $N_{OA}$ be the number of obstructive apneas, $N_{CA}$ be the number of central apneas, and $N_{H}$ be the number of hypopneas. The total number of apneas, $N_A$, is the sum of obstructive and central apneas:\n$$\nN_A = N_{OA} + N_{CA}\n$$\nThe total number of respiratory events is $N_A + N_H$. Let $T$ be the total sleep time in hours. The AHI is then:\n$$\n\\text{AHI} = \\frac{N_{OA} + N_{CA} + N_{H}}{T}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n- $N_{OA} = 40$\n- $N_{CA} = 20$\n- $N_{H} = 50$\n- $T = 8$ hours\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$\n\\text{AHI} = \\frac{40 + 20 + 50}{8} = \\frac{110}{8} = 13.75\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the AHI to three significant figures. The number $13.75$ is rounded to $13.8$. The units are events per hour.\n\nNext, we compute the proportions of obstructive and central apneas among all apnea events. The problem specifies to exclude hypopneas from this calculation. The total number of apneas, $N_A$, is:\n$$\nN_A = N_{OA} + N_{CA} = 40 + 20 = 60\n$$\n\nThe proportion of obstructive apneas, $P_{OA}$, is the ratio of the number of obstructive apneas to the total number of apneas:\n$$\nP_{OA} = \\frac{N_{OA}}{N_A} = \\frac{40}{60} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $0.66666...$. Rounding to four significant figures as required gives $0.6667$.\n\nThe proportion of central apneas, $P_{CA}$, is the ratio of the number of central apneas to the total number of apneas:\n$$\nP_{CA} = \\frac{N_{CA}}{N_A} = \\frac{20}{60} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $0.33333...$. Rounding to four significant figures as required gives $0.3333$.\n\nThe calculated values are:\n- AHI: $13.8$ events/hour\n- Proportion of Obstructive Apnea: $0.6667$\n- Proportion of Central Apnea: $0.3333$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 13.8 & 0.6667 & 0.3333 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4836110"}, {"introduction": "Obstructive sleep apnea is fundamentally a problem of physics—the mechanics of airflow through a collapsible tube.
