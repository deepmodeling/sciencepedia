Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a well-characterized restrictive lung disease known to decrease lung compliance. The definition of static compliance as the change in volume per unit change in pressure ($\\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta P}$) is correct. The provided numerical values for pressure change, volume change, and normal compliance are physiologically realistic. The patient's expected lower compliance is consistent with the pathophysiology of IPF.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data and definitions to calculate the patient's compliance and the subsequent ratio. The objective is clearly stated, and a unique, meaningful solution can be determined.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, objective scientific terminology. It is free of subjective language or opinion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically sound, self-contained, and unambiguously posed. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires the calculation of a dimensionless ratio, which we will denote as $R$, between the patient's static lung compliance, $C_{patient}$, and the typical normal static lung compliance, $C_{normal}$.\n$$R = \\frac{C_{patient}}{C_{normal}}$$\nThe problem defines static lung compliance, $C_{stat}$, as the slope of the quasi-static pressure–volume ($P-V$) curve. For a finite, quasi-static change, this can be calculated as the ratio of the change in lung volume, $\\Delta V$, to the change in transpulmonary pressure, $\\Delta P$.\n$$C_{stat} = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta P}$$\nFirst, we calculate the patient's static lung compliance, $C_{patient}$, using the provided measurements.\nThe change in lung volume is given as $\\Delta V_{patient} = 250 \\text{ mL}$.\nThe change in transpulmonary pressure is given as $\\Delta P_{patient} = 10 \\text{ cmH}_2\\text{O}$.\n\nTo maintain consistency with the units of the normal compliance value ($C_{normal}$), we must convert the volume change from milliliters (mL) to liters (L).\nSince $1 \\text{ L} = 1000 \\text{ mL}$, we have:\n$$\\Delta V_{patient} = 250 \\text{ mL} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ L}}{1000 \\text{ mL}} = 0.250 \\text{ L}$$\nNow, we can calculate the patient's compliance:\n$$C_{patient} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{patient}}{\\Delta P_{patient}} = \\frac{0.250 \\text{ L}}{10 \\text{ cmH}_2\\text{O}} = 0.025 \\text{ L} / \\text{cmH}_2\\text{O}$$\nThe typical normal static lung compliance is given as $C_{normal} = 0.20 \\text{ L per cmH}_2\\text{O}$, which we can write as $C_{normal} = 0.20 \\text{ L} / \\text{cmH}_2\\text{O}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the required ratio, $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{C_{patient}}{C_{normal}} = \\frac{0.025 \\text{ L} / \\text{cmH}_2\\text{O}}{0.20 \\text{ L} / \\text{cmH}_2\\text{O}}$$\nThe units cancel, yielding a dimensionless quantity as required.\n$$R = \\frac{0.025}{0.20} = \\frac{25 \\times 10^{-3}}{20 \\times 10^{-2}} = \\frac{25}{200} = \\frac{1}{8}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$R = 0.125$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $0.125$ already has exactly three significant figures ($1$, $2$, and $5$). Therefore, no further rounding is necessary.

This exercise uses Fick's first law of diffusion, a fundamental principle of transport phenomena, to quantify this impairment.

The analysis will be based on Fick's first law of diffusion and the definition of diffusing capacity.\n\nFirst, we formalize the principles provided. Fick's first law for steady-state diffusion states that the diffusive flux, $J$ (molar amount per unit area per unit time), is proportional to the concentration gradient. For a uniform slab of thickness $T$, this is expressed as:\n$$J = -D_{\\text{true}} \\frac{dC}{dx}$$\nAssuming a linear concentration profile across the membrane, the gradient $\\frac{dC}{dx}$ can be approximated as $\\frac{\\Delta C}{T}$, where $\\Delta C$ is the concentration difference across the membrane. The negative sign indicates diffusion from high to low concentration. We are interested in the magnitude of the flux, so we can write:\n$$J = D_{\\text{true}} \\frac{|\\Delta C|}{T}$$\n\nThe molar transfer rate, $\\dot{M}$, is the total amount of substance diffusing per unit time across the entire area $A$. It is the product of the flux $J$ and the area $A$:\n$$\\dot{M} = J \\cdot A = \\frac{D_{\\text{true}} A |\\Delta C|}{T}$$\n\nIn respiratory physiology, it is more convenient to work with partial pressures than concentrations. The concentration $C$ of a gas in a liquid medium (like the tissue of the alveolar-capillary membrane) is related to its partial pressure $P$ by Henry's Law: $C = S \\cdot P$, where $S$ is the solubility of the gas. The concentration difference $\\Delta C$ is therefore $S \\cdot \\Delta P$, where $\\Delta P$ is the partial pressure difference. Substituting this into the equation for $\\dot{M}$:\n$$\\dot{M} = \\frac{D_{\\text{true}} S A \\Delta P}{T}$$\nThe problem states that $D$ is the *effective* diffusivity, inclusive of solubility effects. This is a common simplification where the product of the true Fickian diffusivity and solubility ($D_{\\text{true}} S$) is represented by a single effective diffusion coefficient, which we are given as $D$. Thus, the equation for the molar transfer rate becomes:\n$$\\dot{M} = \\frac{D A \\Delta P}{T}$$\nwhere $\\Delta P$ is the partial pressure difference for carbon monoxide between the alveoli and the capillary blood.\n\nNext, we use the definition of diffusing capacity of the lung for a gas ($DLCO$), which is given as the ratio of the molar transfer rate ($\\dot{M}$) to the alveolar–capillary partial pressure difference ($\\Delta P$):\n$$DLCO = \\frac{\\dot{M}}{\\Delta P}$$\n\nSubstituting our derived expression for $\\dot{M}$ into this definition yields the expression for $DLCO$:\n$$DLCO = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{D A \\Delta P}{T}\\right)}{\\Delta P}$$\nThe partial pressure difference $\\Delta P$ cancels out, giving the final expression for the diffusing capacity in terms of the physical parameters of the membrane:\n$$DLCO = \\frac{D A}{T}$$\nThis result confirms the physiological intuition that diffusing capacity is directly proportional to the diffusivity and surface area, and inversely proportional to the thickness of the diffusion barrier.\n\nNow, we apply this formula to the specific scenario described in the problem. We denote the initial state with the subscript 'old' and the state after fibrotic thickening with 'new'.\n\nThe initial diffusing capacity, $DLCO_{\\text{old}}$, with a membrane thickness of $T$ is:\n$$DLCO_{\\text{old}} = \\frac{D A}{T}$$\n\nIn the case of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the membrane thickness doubles. The new thickness, $T_{\\text{new}}$, is $2T$. The area $A$ and effective diffusivity $D$ are stated to remain constant. Therefore, the new diffusing capacity, $DLCO_{\\text{new}}$, is:\n$$DLCO_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{D A}{T_{\\text{new}}} = \\frac{D A}{2T}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the percent change in $DLCO$, which is explicitly defined by the formula:\n$$\\text{Percent Change} = \\frac{DLCO_{\\text{new}} - DLCO_{\\text{old}}}{DLCO_{\\text{old}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $DLCO_{\\text{new}}$ and $DLCO_{\\text{old}}$:\n$$\\text{Percent Change} = \\frac{\\frac{D A}{2T} - \\frac{D A}{T}}{\\frac{D A}{T}}$$\nWe can factor out the common term $\\frac{D A}{T}$ from the numerator and denominator:\n$$\\text{Percent Change} = \\frac{\\frac{D A}{T} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - 1\\right)}{\\frac{D A}{T}}$$\nCanceling the term $\\frac{D A}{T}$ leaves:\n$$\\text{Percent Change} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 = -\\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe problem requires this value to be expressed as a single decimal number.\n$$\\text{Percent Change} = -0.5$$\nThis signifies a $50\\%$ decrease in the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide when the membrane thickness doubles, which is a direct consequence of the inverse relationship between diffusing capacity and diffusion distance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.5}$$", "id": "4798344"}, {"introduction": "The devastating nature of IPF lies in its relentless progression, leading to a steady loss of lung function, which is clinically monitored using spirometric measures like Forced Vital Capacity ($FVC$).
