The derived equation, the alveolar gas equation, is a cornerstone of clinical medicine. All provided physiological values ($P_{\\text{aO}_2}$, $P_{\\text{aCO}_2}$, $P_{B}$, $P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$, $R$) are realistic for a patient with a respiratory pathology like a suspected pulmonary embolism.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It requests the derivation of a standard physiological equation and a subsequent calculation for which all necessary parameters are provided. There are no missing or contradictory pieces of information. The problem structure leads to a unique and stable solution. The standard physiological assumption that alveolar $P_{\\text{CO}_2}$ ($P_{\\text{ACO}_2}$) is approximately equal to arterial $P_{\\text{CO}_2}$ ($P_{\\text{aCO}_2}$) is implicitly required, which is a valid and routine assumption in this context.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in an objective, quantitative, and precise manner. There are no subjective elements or opinions.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, missing information, or ambiguity. It is a standard, formalizable problem in physiology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe primary goal is to derive the alveolar gas equation and use it to compute the alveolar oxygen partial pressure ($P_{\\text{AO}_2}$) and the alveolar-arterial (A-a) oxygen gradient ($P_{\\text{AO}_2} - P_{\\text{aO}_2}$).\n\nThe derivation begins with Dalton's law of partial pressures. The total pressure of gas in the airway is the barometric pressure, $P_B$. As inspired air travels down the respiratory tract, it becomes fully saturated with water vapor. Therefore, the total pressure of the dry gases (oxygen, nitrogen, etc.) is the barometric pressure minus the saturated water vapor pressure, $P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$.\n$$P_{\\text{dry}} = P_B - P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$$\nThe partial pressure of inspired oxygen, $P_{\\text{IO}_2}$, is the fraction of inspired oxygen, $F_{\\text{IO}_2}$, multiplied by this total dry gas pressure.\n$$P_{\\text{IO}_2} = F_{\\text{IO}_2} (P_B - P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}})$$\nThis equation gives the partial pressure of oxygen in the humidified air entering the alveoli.\n\nNext, we account for the gas exchange that occurs within the alveoli. Oxygen is continuously removed from the alveolar gas and transferred to the pulmonary capillary blood, while carbon dioxide is continuously added from the blood to the alveolar gas. The relationship between the volume of carbon dioxide produced ($\\dot{V}_{\\text{CO}_2}$) and the volume of oxygen consumed ($\\dot{V}_{\\text{O}_2}$) is defined by the respiratory exchange ratio, $R$.\n$$R = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{\\text{CO}_2}}{\\dot{V}_{\\text{O}_2}}$$\nThe change in the partial pressure of a gas within the alveoli is proportional to its rate of transfer. The decrease in oxygen partial pressure from inspired air to alveolar air is proportional to $\\dot{V}_{\\text{O}_2}$, while the increase in carbon dioxide partial pressure from nearly zero in inspired air to its alveolar level ($P_{\\text{ACO}_2}$) is proportional to $\\dot{V}_{\\text{CO}_2}$. The exact relationship, derived from mass balance equations for alveolar gas, demonstrates that the drop in oxygen caused by uptake is modified by the respiratory exchange ratio. The simplest derivation equates the partial pressure of a gas to its fractional concentration. The fall in O$_2$ partial pressure from inspired to alveolar gas is equal to the partial pressure of O$_2$ taken up by the blood. The partial pressure of CO$_2$ in the alveoli is that added from the blood. The ratio of these two quantities is $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{\\text{Pressure of } CO_2 \\text{ added}}{\\text{Pressure of } O_2 \\text{ removed}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{ACO}_2}}{P_{\\text{IO}_2} - P_{\\text{AO}_2}}$$\nNote that we assume the inspired partial pressure of $CO_2$ is negligible. Rearranging this equation to solve for the quantity of oxygen removed gives:\n$$P_{\\text{IO}_2} - P_{\\text{AO}_2} = \\frac{P_{\\text{ACO}_2}}{R}$$\nFinally, we solve for the alveolar oxygen partial pressure, $P_{\\text{AO}_2}$:\n$$P_{\\text{AO}_2} = P_{\\text{IO}_2} - \\frac{P_{\\text{ACO}_2}}{R}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P_{\\text{IO}_2}$, we arrive at the alveolar gas equation:\n$$P_{\\text{AO}_2} = F_{\\text{IO}_2} (P_B - P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}) - \\frac{P_{\\text{ACO}_2}}{R}$$\nIn clinical practice, it is a standard and valid assumption that the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide ($P_{\\text{ACO}_2}$) is very close to the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide ($P_{\\text{aCO}_2}$) because $CO_2$ is a highly diffusible gas. Thus, we can write the equation in its practical form:\n$$P_{\\text{AO}_2} = F_{\\text{IO}_2} (P_B - P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}) - \\frac{P_{\\text{aCO}_2}}{R}$$\nThis is the required expression. Now we can compute the numerical value for $P_{\\text{AO}_2}$ using the given data:\n- $F_{\\text{IO}_2} = 0.21$\n- $P_B = 760 \\text{ mmHg}$\n- $P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}} = 47 \\text{ mmHg}$\n- $P_{\\text{aCO}_2} = 32 \\text{ mmHg}$\n- $R = 0.8$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$P_{\\text{AO}_2} = 0.21 \\times (760 - 47) - \\frac{32}{0.8}$$\n$$P_{\\text{AO}_2} = 0.21 \\times (713) - 40$$\n$$P_{\\text{AO}_2} = 149.73 - 40$$\n$$P_{\\text{AO}_2} = 109.73 \\text{ mmHg}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $P_{\\text{AO}_2} = 109.7$ mmHg.\n\nNext, we compute the alveolar–arterial (A–a) oxygen gradient, which is defined as the difference between the alveolar oxygen partial pressure and the arterial oxygen partial pressure.\n$$\\text{A–a gradient} = P_{\\text{AO}_2} - P_{\\text{aO}_2}$$\nUsing the calculated value of $P_{\\text{AO}_2} = 109.73$ mmHg (using the unrounded value for precision) and the given value $P_{\\text{aO}_2} = 68$ mmHg:\n$$\\text{A–a gradient} = 109.73 - 68$$\n$$\\text{A–a gradient} = 41.73 \\text{ mmHg}$$\nThis value already has four significant figures, so no further rounding is needed. A large A-a gradient, such as this one, is indicative of a defect in gas exchange, consistent with the suspected diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.\n\nThe two computed values are $P_{\\text{AO}_2} = 109.7$ mmHg and A–a gradient $= 41.73$ mmHg.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n109.7 & 41.73\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4978011"}, {"introduction": "When a pulmonary artery is obstructed, the alveoli it normally supplies continue to be ventilated but are no longer perfused, creating what is known as alveolar dead space.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Estimator for Physiologic Dead Space Fraction\n\nThe physiologic dead space fraction, $\\frac{V_D}{V_T}$, is the fraction of the tidal volume ($V_T$) that does not participate in gas exchange. We can derive an estimator for this fraction by applying the principle of conservation of mass for carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) over a single tidal breath.\n\nThe total amount of $CO_2$ exhaled in a single breath must equal the sum of $CO_2$ coming from the two components of the tidal volume: the alveolar volume ($V_A$) and the dead space volume ($V_D$).\nLet $F_{\\bar{E}CO_2}$ be the mean fraction of $CO_2$ in mixed expired gas, $F_A CO_2$ be the fraction of $CO_2$ in alveolar gas, and $F_D CO_2$ be the fraction of $CO_2$ in dead space gas. The conservation equation for the volume of $CO_2$ exhaled is:\n$$V_T \\cdot F_{\\bar{E}CO_2} = V_A \\cdot F_A CO_2 + V_D \\cdot F_D CO_2$$\nThe problem states that dead space contributes negligible carbon dioxide. This gas is essentially inspired air, so we set $F_D CO_2 \\approx 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$V_T \\cdot F_{\\bar{E}CO_2} = V_A \\cdot F_A CO_2$$\nUsing Dalton's law of partial pressures, the fraction of a gas is proportional to its partial pressure. We can therefore rewrite the equation in terms of partial pressures, where $P_{\\bar{E}CO_2}$ is the partial pressure of $CO_2$ in mixed expired gas and $P_{\\text{ACO}_2}$ is the partial pressure of $CO_2$ in alveolar gas:\n$$V_T \\cdot P_{\\bar{E}CO_2} = V_A \\cdot P_{\\text{ACO}_2}$$\nWe are given that $V_T = V_A + V_D$, which implies $V_A = V_T - V_D$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$V_T \\cdot P_{\\bar{E}CO_2} = (V_T - V_D) \\cdot P_{\\text{ACO}_2}$$\nDividing both sides by $V_T$:\n$$P_{\\bar{E}CO_2} = \\left(1 - \\frac{V_D}{V_T}\\right) \\cdot P_{\\text{ACO}_2}$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for the dead space fraction $\\frac{V_D}{V_T}$ yields the Bohr equation:\n$$\\frac{V_D}{V_T} = \\frac{P_{\\text{ACO}_2} - P_{\\bar{E}CO_2}}{P_{\\text{ACO}_2}}$$\nTo use this equation with the clinical data provided, we must invoke two key physiological approximations as requested.\n\n**Physiological Approximation 1:** We assume that the partial pressure of $CO_2$ in the arterial blood ($P_{\\text{aCO}_2}$) is a reliable estimate of the mean partial pressure of $CO_2$ in the gas of all perfused alveoli ($P_{\\text{ACO}_2}$). This is justified by the high diffusibility of $CO_2$ across the alveolar-capillary membrane. This substitution results in the Enghoff modification of the Bohr equation.\n$$P_{\\text{ACO}_2} \\approx P_{\\text{aCO}_2}$$\nThus,\n$$\\frac{V_D}{V_T} \\approx \\frac{P_{\\text{aCO}_2} - P_{\\bar{E}CO_2}}{P_{\\text{aCO}_2}}$$\n\n**Physiological Approximation 2:** The problem provides End-Tidal $CO_2$ ($P_{\\text{ETCO}_2}$), which is the partial pressure of $CO_2$ at the end of expiration, not the mean mixed-expired partial pressure ($P_{\\bar{E}CO_2}$). A common clinical simplification, and the one required to construct the requested estimator, is to use $P_{\\text{ETCO}_2}$ as a surrogate for $P_{\\bar{E}CO_2}$. While numerically $P_{\\bar{E}CO_2}  P_{\\text{ETCO}_2}$, the resulting expression is a useful clinical index for dead space fraction, as the gradient $P_{\\text{aCO}_2} - P_{\\text{ETCO}_2}$ correlates strongly with the amount of alveolar dead space.\n$$P_{\\bar{E}CO_2} \\approx P_{\\text{ETCO}_2}$$\nSubstituting this into the equation gives the final derived estimator:\n$$\\frac{V_D}{V_T} \\approx \\frac{P_{\\text{aCO}_2} - P_{\\text{ETCO}_2}}{P_{\\text{aCO}_2}}$$\n\n### Calculation of Dead Space Fractions and the Absolute Increase\n\nNow we apply this estimator to the data provided.\n\n1.  **Baseline Dead Space Fraction:**\n    Using the baseline values $P_{\\text{aCO}_2} = 38$ mmHg and $P_{\\text{ETCO}_2} = 36$ mmHg:\n    $$\\left(\\frac{V_D}{V_T}\\right)_{\\text{base}} = \\frac{38 - 36}{38} = \\frac{2}{38} = \\frac{1}{19}$$\n    $$\\left(\\frac{V_D}{V_T}\\right)_{\\text{base}} \\approx 0.05263$$\n\n2.  **Current Dead Space Fraction:**\n    Using the current values $P_{\\text{aCO}_2} = 30$ mmHg and $P_{\\text{ETCO}_2} = 20$ mmHg:\n    $$\\left(\\frac{V_D}{V_T}\\right)_{\\text{curr}} = \\frac{30 - 20}{30} = \\frac{10}{30} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n    $$\\left(\\frac{V_D}{V_T}\\right)_{\\text{curr}} \\approx 0.33333$$\n\n3.  **Absolute Increase in Dead Space Fraction:**\n    The absolute increase is the difference between the current and baseline fractions.\n    $$\\text{Absolute Increase} = \\left(\\frac{V_D}{V_T}\\right)_{\\text{curr}} - \\left(\\frac{V_D}{V_T}\\right)_{\\text{base}}$$\n    $$\\text{Absolute Increase} = \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{19}$$\n    To subtract the fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $3 \\times 19 = 57$:\n    $$\\text{Absolute Increase} = \\frac{19}{57} - \\frac{3}{57} = \\frac{16}{57}$$\n    Converting this fraction to a decimal:\n    $$\\text{Absolute Increase} \\approx 0.28070175...$$\n    Rounding the result to three significant figures as requested gives $0.281$.

A negative result in a low-probability patient (Patient A) makes PE extremely unlikely ($P(D_A\\mid -) \\approx 0.01$), effectively ruling it out. However, a negative result in a moderate-probability patient (Patient B) still leaves a non-trivial chance of PE ($P(D_B\\mid -) \\approx 0.063$), which may not be low enough to stop further investigation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{19}{157}  \\frac{133}{289}  \\frac{1}{93}  \\frac{7}{111}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4978009"}]}
