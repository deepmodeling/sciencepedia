A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Calculation**\nThe relationship between pressure gradient ($\\Delta P$), flow ($Q$), and resistance ($R$) in a fluid system under steady-state conditions is governed by the fundamental hemodynamic equation:\n$$\n\\Delta P = Q \\times R\n$$\nThis principle can be applied to the pulmonary circulation to determine the pulmonary vascular resistance ($PVR$).\n\nFor the pulmonary circuit:\n- The flow ($Q$) is the cardiac output ($CO$).\n- The pressure gradient ($\\Delta P$) is the difference between the mean pressure entering the pulmonary arteries ($mPAP$) and the mean pressure in the pulmonary veins as they enter the left atrium. The pulmonary artery wedge pressure ($PAWP$) serves as a clinical surrogate for the left atrial pressure.\n- The resistance ($R$) is the pulmonary vascular resistance ($PVR$).\n\nTherefore, the equation can be written as:\n$$\nmPAP - PAWP = CO \\times PVR\n$$\nSolving for $PVR$, we obtain the expression:\n$$\nPVR = \\frac{mPAP - PAWP}{CO}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given values into this equation. The units are already in the required form (mmHg for pressure, L/min for flow) to yield a result in Wood units (mmHg·min/L).\n\nGiven:\n- $mPAP = 34$ mmHg\n- $PAWP = 10$ mmHg\n- $CO = 5$ L/min\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n$$\nPVR = \\frac{34 \\, \\text{mmHg} - 10 \\, \\text{mmHg}}{5 \\, \\text{L/min}}\n$$\n$$\nPVR = \\frac{24 \\, \\text{mmHg}}{5 \\, \\text{L/min}}\n$$\n$$\nPVR = 4.8 \\, \\text{mmHg} \\cdot \\text{min/L}\n$$\nThe unit mmHg·min/L is defined as a Wood unit. The problem requires rounding the result to three significant figures. The calculated value is $4.8$, which can be written as $4.80$ to explicitly show three significant figures.\nThus, the pulmonary vascular resistance is $4.80$ Wood units.\n\n**Hemodynamic Classification**\nThe second part of the problem is to determine if these findings are consistent with precapillary pulmonary hypertension. According to the current consensus definition (from the 6th World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension), precapillary pulmonary hypertension is defined by the simultaneous presence of the following three hemodynamic criteria:\n1.  Mean pulmonary artery pressure ($mPAP$) > $20$ mmHg.\n2.  Pulmonary artery wedge pressure ($PAWP$) $\\le 15$ mmHg.\n3.  Pulmonary vascular resistance ($PVR$) > 2$ Wood units.\n\nLet us compare the patient's measured and calculated values against these criteria:\n1.  The patient's $mPAP$ is $34$ mmHg. Since $34 > 20$, this criterion is met.\n2.  The patient's $PAWP$ is $10$ mmHg. Since $10 \\le 15$, this criterion is met.\n3.  The patient's calculated $PVR$ is $4.80$ Wood units. Since $4.80 > 2$, this criterion is met.\n\nSince all three criteria are satisfied, the patient's hemodynamic profile is indeed consistent with a diagnosis of precapillary pulmonary hypertension.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4.80}\n$$", "id": "4829660"}, {"introduction": "Having established how to measure increased pulmonary vascular resistance, we now explore its direct mechanical consequence on the heart muscle itself.

It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. Therefore, a full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe first task is to derive the expression for the circumferential wall stress, $\\sigma$. We model the right ventricle as a thin-walled spherical shell of radius $r$ and thickness $h$, subjected to an internal transmural pressure $P$.\n\nTo find the stress, we consider the mechanical equilibrium of one hemisphere of the shell. Imagine cutting the sphere in half. The internal pressure $P$ exerts an outward force on the circular cross-section of the fluid (or blood) that was \"exposed\" by the cut. The area of this circular cross-section is $A_{pressure} = \\pi r^{2}$. The total force exerted by the pressure on this area is:\n$$F_{P} = P \\cdot A_{pressure} = P \\pi r^{2}$$\n\nThis outward force must be balanced by the internal tensile force within the wall of the shell, acting along the circumference of the cut. The circumferential wall stress $\\sigma$ is defined as force per unit area. The cross-sectional area of the wall material where the cut was made is approximately a thin ring with circumference $2\\pi r$ and thickness $h$. Thus, the area of the wall is $A_{wall} = 2\\pi r h$. The total tensile force in the wall is:\n$$F_{T} = \\sigma \\cdot A_{wall} = \\sigma (2\\pi r h)$$\n\nFor the hemisphere to be in static equilibrium, the pressure force must equal the tensile force:\n$$F_{P} = F_{T}$$\n$$P \\pi r^{2} = \\sigma (2\\pi r h)$$\n\nWe now solve for the wall stress $\\sigma$:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{P \\pi r^{2}}{2\\pi r h}$$\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{Pr}{2h}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the circumferential wall stress in a thin-walled spherical shell.\n\nThe second task is to compute the change in wall stress, $\\Delta \\sigma$, between the initial state ($1$) and the later state ($2$). Let $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$ be the wall stresses at the initial and later states, respectively.\n\nUsing the derived formula, the initial wall stress $\\sigma_{1}$ is:\n$$\\sigma_{1} = \\frac{P_{1}r}{2h_{1}}$$\nSubstituting the given values $P_{1} = 20\\,\\text{mmHg}$, $r = 20\\,\\text{mm}$, and $h_{1} = 4\\,\\text{mm}$:\n$$\\sigma_{1} = \\frac{(20\\,\\text{mmHg})(20\\,\\text{mm})}{2(4\\,\\text{mm})} = \\frac{400}{8}\\,\\text{mmHg} = 50\\,\\text{mmHg}$$\n\nThe wall stress at the later state, $\\sigma_{2}$, is:\n$$\\sigma_{2} = \\frac{P_{2}r}{2h_{2}}$$\nSubstituting the given values $P_{2} = 40\\,\\text{mmHg}$, $r = 20\\,\\text{mm}$, and $h_{2} = 6\\,\\text{mm}$:\n$$\\sigma_{2} = \\frac{(40\\,\\text{mmHg})(20\\,\\text{mm})}{2(6\\,\\text{mm})} = \\frac{800}{12}\\,\\text{mmHg} = \\frac{200}{3}\\,\\text{mmHg}$$\n\nThe change in wall stress, $\\Delta \\sigma$, is the difference between $\\sigma_{2}$ and $\\sigma_{1}$:\n$$\\Delta \\sigma = \\sigma_{2} - \\sigma_{1}$$\n$$\\Delta \\sigma = \\frac{200}{3}\\,\\text{mmHg} - 50\\,\\text{mmHg}$$\nTo subtract these, we find a common denominator:\n$$\\Delta \\sigma = \\frac{200}{3}\\,\\text{mmHg} - \\frac{150}{3}\\,\\text{mmHg} = \\frac{200 - 150}{3}\\,\\text{mmHg} = \\frac{50}{3}\\,\\text{mmHg}$$\n\nFinally, we convert this fraction to a decimal and round to three significant figures as required.\n$$\\Delta \\sigma = 16.666... \\,\\text{mmHg}$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives:\n$$\\Delta \\sigma \\approx 16.7\\,\\text{mmHg}$$\nThis result indicates that despite the RV wall thickening (a compensatory mechanism), the significant rise in pressure still leads to an overall increase in myocardial wall stress.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{16.7}$$", "id": "4829625"}, {"introduction": "The final piece of the pathophysiological puzzle involves the critical balance of oxygen supply and demand.

According to the provided information, the total arterial oxygen content is the sum of two components: the oxygen chemically bound to hemoglobin and the oxygen physically dissolved in the plasma. We can write this relationship as:\n$$\nCaO_{2} = [\\text{Hemoglobin-bound } O_{2}] + [\\text{Dissolved } O_{2}]\n$$\nLet us derive an expression for each component separately.\n\nFirst, we consider the hemoglobin-bound oxygen. The problem states that each gram of hemoglobin ($Hb$) can carry a maximum of $1.34$ $\\mathrm{mL}$ of $O_{2}$. This value is known as the Hüfner constant. Therefore, the maximum oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, based on its hemoglobin concentration, is the product of the hemoglobin concentration, $Hb$ (in $\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{dL}$), and this constant. The actual amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin is this maximum capacity multiplied by the arterial oxygen saturation, $SaO_{2}$, which represents the fraction of hemoglobin's oxygen-binding sites that are occupied.\n$$\n[\\text{Hemoglobin-bound } O_{2}] = Hb \\times 1.34 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mL} \\, O_{2}}{\\mathrm{g} \\, Hb} \\times SaO_{2}\n$$\nThe units for this component are $(\\frac{\\mathrm{g} \\, Hb}{\\mathrm{dL}}) \\times (\\frac{\\mathrm{mL} \\, O_{2}}{\\mathrm{g} \\, Hb}) = \\frac{\\mathrm{mL} \\, O_{2}}{\\mathrm{dL}}$, which is a concentration, as expected.\n\nSecond, we consider the physically dissolved oxygen. The problem states that this is governed by Henry’s law, where the concentration of dissolved gas is proportional to its partial pressure. The concentration is given as the product of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen, $PaO_{2}$ (in $\\mathrm{mmHg}$), and a solubility coefficient, which is given as $0.003$ $\\mathrm{mL}$ $O_{2}$ per $\\mathrm{dL}$ of blood per $\\mathrm{mmHg}$ of partial pressure.\n$$\n[\\text{Dissolved } O_{2}] = PaO_{2} \\times 0.003 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mL} \\, O_{2}}{\\mathrm{dL} \\cdot \\mathrm{mmHg}}\n$$\nThe units for this component are $(\\mathrm{mmHg}) \\times (\\frac{\\mathrm{mL} \\, O_{2}}{\\mathrm{dL} \\cdot \\mathrm{mmHg}}) = \\frac{\\mathrm{mL} \\, O_{2}}{\\mathrm{dL}}$, which is also a concentration.\n\nCombining these two components, we obtain the general expression for arterial oxygen content, $CaO_{2}$:\n$$\nCaO_{2} = (Hb \\times 1.34 \\times SaO_{2}) + (PaO_{2} \\times 0.003)\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for $CaO_{2}$ in terms of $Hb$, $SaO_{2}$, and $PaO_{2}$.\n\nNow, we substitute the patient's measured values into this expression to compute the numerical value. The given values are:\n- Hemoglobin concentration, $Hb = 12$ $\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{dL}$\n- Arterial oxygen saturation, $SaO_{2} = 0.90$\n- Partial pressure of arterial oxygen, $PaO_{2} = 60$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n\nSubstituting these values, we get:\n$$\nCaO_{2} = (12 \\times 1.34 \\times 0.90) + (60 \\times 0.003)\n$$\nFirst, calculate the hemoglobin-bound component:\n$$\n12 \\times 1.34 \\times 0.90 = 16.08 \\times 0.90 = 14.472 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mL} \\, O_{2}}{\\mathrm{dL}}\n$$\nNext, calculate the dissolved component:\n$$\n60 \\times 0.003 = 0.18 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mL} \\, O_{2}}{\\mathrm{dL}}\n$$\nFinally, sum the two components to find the total arterial oxygen content:\n$$\nCaO_{2} = 14.472 + 0.18 = 14.652 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mL} \\, O_{2}}{\\mathrm{dL}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nCaO_{2} \\approx 14.65 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mL} \\, O_{2}}{\\mathrm{dL}}\n$$\nIn the context of cor pulmonale, the right ventricle (RV) is hypertrophied and subjected to a high afterload from pulmonary hypertension, leading to a substantial increase in its myocardial oxygen demand.
