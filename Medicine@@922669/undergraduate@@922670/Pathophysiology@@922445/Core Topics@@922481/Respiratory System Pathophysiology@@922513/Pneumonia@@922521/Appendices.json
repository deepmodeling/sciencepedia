By working from first principles, you will gain a quantitative appreciation for how structural changes at the microscopic level lead to systemic hypoxemia.", "problem": "In the context of pneumonia, inflammatory edema increases the thickness of the alveolar–capillary barrier, impairing oxygen transfer. Consider oxygen diffusing at steady state across a uniform, plane alveolar–capillary membrane of thickness $T$ and area $A$, from the alveolar gas side with oxygen partial pressure $P_{1}$ to the capillary blood side with oxygen partial pressure $P_{2}$, where $P_{1} > P_{2}$. Assume the diffusion coefficient of oxygen within the membrane material is $D_{T}$ (treated as constant across $x$), the oxygen concentration within the membrane phase is proportional to the local oxygen partial pressure by Henry’s law with solubility $\\alpha$, that there is no reactive consumption within the membrane, and that the system is at steady state with a constant flux.\n\nStarting explicitly from Fick’s first law of diffusion $J(x) = - D_{T}\\,\\frac{dC}{dx}$ and Henry’s law $C(x) = \\alpha\\,P(x)$, derive an expression for the steady-state molar flow rate of oxygen $V_{O_{2}}$ across the membrane in terms of $A$, $T$, $P_{1}$, $P_{2}$, and a single effective diffusivity parameter $D$ you define from the physical parameters of the membrane and oxygen. Then, model pneumonia-induced edema as a doubling of membrane thickness to $2T$ while $A$, $D$, $P_{1}$, and $P_{2}$ remain unchanged.
