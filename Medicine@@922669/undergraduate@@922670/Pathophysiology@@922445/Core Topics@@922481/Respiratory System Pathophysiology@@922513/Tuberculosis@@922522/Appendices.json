According to Fick's first law, $J_r = -D \\frac{dC_u}{dr}$.

We can solve for $P^{\\ast}$ by rearranging the terms:\n$$\n\\alpha\\,S_{\\gamma}(G)\\,(1-P^{\\ast}) = \\beta\\,S_{4}(L)\\,P^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha\\,S_{\\gamma}(G) - \\alpha\\,S_{\\gamma}(G)\\,P^{\\ast} = \\beta\\,S_{4}(L)\\,P^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha\\,S_{\\gamma}(G) = \\alpha\\,S_{\\gamma}(G)\\,P^{\\ast} + \\beta\\,S_{4}(L)\\,P^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha\\,S_{\\gamma}(G) = \\left( \\alpha\\,S_{\\gamma}(G) + \\beta\\,S_{4}(L) \\right) P^{\\ast}\n$$\nSolving for $P^{\\ast}$ gives the general expression for the steady-state polarization index:\n$$\nP^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha\\,S_{\\gamma}(G)}{\\alpha\\,S_{\\gamma}(G) + \\beta\\,S_{4}(L)}\n$$\nNext, we must compute the numerical value of $P^{\\ast}$ using the provided parameters. First, we calculate the values of the Hill saturation functions $S_{\\gamma}(G)$ and $S_{4}(L)$.\n\nThe parameters are:\n$$\nG=2\\ \\text{nM}, \\quad K_{\\gamma}=1\\ \\text{nM}, \\quad n=2\n$$\n$$\nL=5\\ \\text{nM}, \\quad K_{4}=2\\ \\text{nM}, \\quad m=2\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha=0.8\\ \\text{h}^{-1}, \\quad \\beta=0.6\\ \\text{h}^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe IFN-$\\gamma$ saturation term $S_{\\gamma}(G)$ is:\n$$\nS_{\\gamma}(G) = \\frac{G^{n}}{K_{\\gamma}^{n}+G^{n}} = \\frac{(2)^{2}}{(1)^{2}+(2)^{2}} = \\frac{4}{1+4} = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8\n$$\nThe IL-4 saturation term $S_{4}(L)$ is:\n$$\nS_{4}(L) = \\frac{L^{m}}{K_{4}^{m}+L^{m}} = \\frac{(5)^{2}}{(2)^{2}+(5)^{2}} = \\frac{25}{4+25} = \\frac{25}{29}\n$$\nNow we substitute these values, along with $\\alpha=0.8$ and $\\beta=0.6$, into the expression for $P^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nP^{\\ast} = \\frac{(0.8) \\times (0.8)}{(0.8) \\times (0.8) + (0.6) \\times \\left(\\frac{25}{29}\\right)}\n$$\n$$\nP^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.64}{0.64 + \\frac{15}{29}}\n$$\nTo compute the value, we can evaluate the fraction in the denominator:\n$$\n\\frac{15}{29} \\approx 0.517241379...\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $P^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nP^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.64}{0.64 + 0.517241379...} = \\frac{0.64}{1.157241379...}\n$$\n$$\nP^{\\ast} \\approx 0.553039332...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure is $3$, so we round down.\n$$\nP^{\\ast} \\approx 0.5530\n$$\nThis value is dimensionless and lies within the defined range $P \\in [0,1]$, which is consistent with its interpretation as a polarization index.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5530}\n$$", "id": "4844948"}]}
