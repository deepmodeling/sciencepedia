This occurs when a portion of the mixed venous blood from the right ventricle bypasses ventilated alveoli and mixes directly with oxygenated blood returning from functional lung units. The result is a lowering of the arterial oxygen content ($C_{a O_2}$) and partial pressure of oxygen ($P_{a O_2}$), a condition known as arterial hypoxemia. A hallmark of hypoxemia caused by a true shunt is its poor response to supplemental oxygen. Even when the fraction of inspired oxygen ($F_{I O_2}$) is increased to $1.0$, the shunted blood remains deoxygenated because it never comes into contact with alveolar gas, thus the resulting arterial hypoxemia persists. This is in contrast to hypoxemia caused by ventilation-perfusion ($V/Q$) mismatch, which typically improves significantly with supplemental oxygen. In the context of lobar pneumonia, a true shunt is created when alveoli in the affected lobe become filled with inflammatory exudate (consolidation), preventing ventilation but not completely halting perfusion. Blood flowing through these non-ventilated lung regions constitutes the shunt.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Shunt Fraction**\n\nThe shunt fraction, denoted as $\\frac{\\dot{Q}_s}{\\dot{Q}_t}$, where $\\dot{Q}_s$ is the shunted blood flow and $\\dot{Q}_t$ is the total cardiac output, can be calculated using a mass balance equation for oxygen. The process involves several steps.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Alveolar Partial Pressure of Oxygen ($P_{A O_2}$)**\nWe use the alveolar gas equation, which relates the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli to the inspired oxygen concentration and the arterial carbon dioxide level.\nThe equation is:\n$$P_{A O_2} = [F_{I O_2} (P_B - P_{H_2O})] - \\frac{P_{a CO_2}}{R}$$\nUsing the provided values: $F_{I O_2} = 0.21$, $P_B = 760\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$, $P_{H_2O} = 47\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$, $P_{a CO_2} = 40\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$, and $R = 0.8$.\n$$P_{A O_2} = [0.21 \\times (760 - 47)] - \\frac{40}{0.8}$$\n$$P_{A O_2} = [0.21 \\times 713] - 50$$\n$$P_{A O_2} = 149.73 - 50 = 99.73\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Oxygen Content ($C_{O_2}$) for Each Blood Compartment**\nThe oxygen content of blood is the sum of oxygen bound to hemoglobin and oxygen dissolved in plasma. The general formula is:\n$$C_{x O_2} = (\\mathrm{Hb} \\times 1.34 \\times S_{x O_2}) + (P_{x O_2} \\times 0.003)$$\nwhere the Hb-binding capacity is $1.34\\ \\mathrm{mL\\ O_2/g\\ Hb}$ and the solubility coefficient is $0.003\\ \\mathrm{mL\\ O_2/(dL\\cdot mmHg)}$.

Per the problem statement, we assume this blood is fully saturated, so $S_{c O_2} = 1.00$.\n$$C_{c O_2} = (15 \\times 1.34 \\times 1.00) + (99.73 \\times 0.003)$$\n$$C_{c O_2} = 20.1 + 0.29919 = 20.39919\\ \\mathrm{mL/dL}$$\n\n- **Arterial Oxygen Content ($C_{a O_2}$):** This is the content of the mixed blood in the systemic arteries. We use the measured arterial values: $P_{a O_2} = 60\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$ and $S_{a O_2} = 0.90$.\n$$C_{a O_2} = (15 \\times 1.34 \\times 0.90) + (60 \\times 0.003)$$\n$$C_{a O_2} = 18.09 + 0.18 = 18.27\\ \\mathrm{mL/dL}$$\n\n- **Mixed Venous Oxygen Content ($C_{v O_2}$):** This is the content of blood returning to the lungs from the body's tissues. We use the measured mixed venous values: $P_{v O_2} = 40\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$ and $S_{v O_2} = 0.70$.\n$$C_{v O_2} = (15 \\times 1.34 \\times 0.70) + (40 \\times 0.003)$$\n$$C_{v O_2} = 14.07 + 0.12 = 14.19\\ \\mathrm{mL/dL}$$\n\n**Step 3: Derive and Compute the Shunt Fraction ($\\frac{\\dot{Q}_s}{\\dot{Q}_t}$)**\nThe shunt equation is derived from the principle of conservation of mass for oxygen. The total amount of oxygen carried in arterial blood is the weighted average of the oxygen from the shunted blood and the oxygen from the normally perfused capillary blood.\nTotal cardiac output ($\\dot{Q}_t$) is the sum of shunted flow ($\\dot{Q}_s$) and capillary flow ($\\dot{Q}_c$): $\\dot{Q}_t = \\dot{Q}_s + \\dot{Q}_c$.\nThe mass balance equation for oxygen flow is:\n$$\\dot{Q}_t \\cdot C_{a O_2} = (\\dot{Q}_s \\cdot C_{v O_2}) + (\\dot{Q}_c \\cdot C_{c O_2})$$\nSubstituting $\\dot{Q}_c = \\dot{Q}_t - \\dot{Q}_s$ into the equation:\n$$\\dot{Q}_t \\cdot C_{a O_2} = (\\dot{Q}_s \\cdot C_{v O_2}) + ((\\dot{Q}_t - \\dot{Q}_s) \\cdot C_{c O_2})$$\nRearranging the terms to solve for the ratio $\\frac{\\dot{Q}_s}{\\dot{Q}_t}$:\n$$\\dot{Q}_t \\cdot C_{a O_2} = \\dot{Q}_s \\cdot C_{v O_2} + \\dot{Q}_t \\cdot C_{c O_2} - \\dot{Q}_s \\cdot C_{c O_2}$$\n$$\\dot{Q}_s \\cdot C_{c O_2} - \\dot{Q}_s \\cdot C_{v O_2} = \\dot{Q}_t \\cdot C_{c O_2} - \\dot{Q}_t \\cdot C_{a O_2}$$\n$$\\dot{Q}_s (C_{c O_2} - C_{v O_2}) = \\dot{Q}_t (C_{c O_2} - C_{a O_2})$$\nThis yields the classic shunt equation:\n$$\\frac{\\dot{Q}_s}{\\dot{Q}_t} = \\frac{C_{c O_2} - C_{a O_2}}{C_{c O_2} - C_{v O_2}}$$\nNow, we substitute the calculated oxygen content values:\n$$\\frac{\\dot{Q}_s}{\\dot{Q}_t} = \\frac{20.39919 - 18.27}{20.39919 - 14.19}$$\n$$\\frac{\\dot{Q}_s}{\\dot{Q}_t} = \\frac{2.12919}{6.20919} \\approx 0.34291$$\nRounding the final result to three significant figures, the shunt fraction is $0.343$.
