It contains no logical contradictions, missing information, or pseudoscientific claims. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires starting from the classical laminar flow relationship for a Newtonian fluid in a cylindrical tube. This is described by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which relates the volumetric flow rate $Q$ to the pressure drop $\\Delta P$ along a tube of length $L$ and radius $r$, for a fluid of dynamic viscosity $\\eta$. The equation is:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}\n$$\nThe airway resistance $R$ is defined in the problem statement as:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\Delta P}{Q}\n$$\nTo find the dependence of resistance $R$ on radius $r$, we rearrange the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to express the ratio $\\Delta P / Q$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta P}{Q} = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4}\n$$\nBy combining this with the definition of resistance, we obtain the expression for airway resistance:\n$$\nR = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4}\n$$\nThis equation establishes the dependence of resistance on the airway's geometric and fluid properties. As the problem states that the airway length $L$ and the gas viscosity $\\eta$ are constant, we can express the resistance as being proportional to the inverse fourth power of the radius:\n$$\nR \\propto \\frac{1}{r^4}\n$$\nLet $R_0$ be the initial, baseline resistance when the airway radius is $r_0$.\n$$\nR_0 = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r_0^4}\n$$\nLet $R_1$ be the final resistance after bronchoconstriction, when the airway radius is $r_1$.\n$$\nR_1 = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r_1^4}\n$$\nTo determine the change in resistance, we can compute the ratio of the final resistance $R_1$ to the initial resistance $R_0$.\n$$\n\\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{\\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r_1^4}}{\\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r_0^4}}\n$$\nThe constant terms $8$, $\\eta$, $L$, and $\\pi$ cancel, leaving a relationship purely dependent on the radii:\n$$\n\\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{r_0^4}{r_1^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_0}{r_1}\\right)^4\n$$\nThe problem provides the relationship between the final and initial radii: $r_1 = 0.80 \\, r_0$.

This practice models how bronchoconstriction leads to an increase in physiologic dead space, meaning more of each breath is wasted.

In this setting, physiologic dead space increases because more of each tidal breath fails to participate in gas exchange.

Initially, physiologic dead space is $V_D = 200$ mL, and the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide is measured at $40$ mmHg. During worsening airflow obstruction and ventilation-perfusion heterogeneity, physiologic dead space increases to $V_D = 250$ mL, while $V_T$ and $f$ remain unchanged over the time window considered.

The core of the problem lies in the steady-state relationship between the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide ($P_{A,CO_2}$), the metabolic production of carbon dioxide ($V_{CO_2}$), and alveolar ventilation ($V_A$).\n\nThe relationship is described by the alveolar ventilation equation:\n$$P_{A,CO_2} = k \\frac{V_{CO_2}}{V_A}$$\nwhere $k$ is a proportionality constant. The problem states that the patient's carbon dioxide production, $V_{CO_2}$, remains constant during the observed period. This implies that the product of $P_{A,CO_2}$ and $V_A$ must remain constant between the initial and final steady-state conditions. We can express this invariance as:\n$$P_{A,CO_2,initial} \\times V_{A,initial} = P_{A,CO_2,final} \\times V_{A,final}$$\n\nTo use this relationship, we must first calculate the initial and final alveolar ventilation rates. Alveolar ventilation, $V_A$, is defined as the volume of fresh air reaching the alveoli per unit time. It is calculated by subtracting the dead space ventilation from the total minute ventilation. The minute ventilation ($V_E$) is the total volume of air inspired per minute, given by the product of tidal volume ($V_T$) and respiratory frequency ($f$):\n$$V_E = V_T \\times f$$\nThe dead space ventilation ($V_{D,vent}$) is the portion of minute ventilation that does not participate in gas exchange, given by the product of physiologic dead space volume ($V_D$) and respiratory frequency ($f$):\n$$V_{D,vent} = V_D \\times f$$\nTherefore, alveolar ventilation is:\n$$V_A = V_E - V_{D,vent} = (V_T - V_D) \\times f$$\n\nWe are given the following initial conditions:\n- Tidal volume, $V_T = 500$ mL\n- Respiratory frequency, $f = 20$ breaths/min\n- Initial physiologic dead space, $V_{D,initial} = 200$ mL\n- Initial alveolar $P_{CO_2}$, $P_{A,CO_2,initial} = 40$ mmHg\n\nUsing these values, we calculate the initial alveolar ventilation ($V_{A,initial}$):\n$$V_{A,initial} = (V_T - V_{D,initial}) \\times f$$\n$$V_{A,initial} = (500 \\text{ mL} - 200 \\text{ mL}) \\times 20 \\text{ min}^{-1}$$\n$$V_{A,initial} = 300 \\text{ mL} \\times 20 \\text{ min}^{-1} = 6000 \\text{ mL/min}$$\n\nNext, we consider the final state, where the physiologic dead space has increased due to worsening airflow obstruction. The final conditions are:\n- Tidal volume, $V_T = 500$ mL (unchanged)\n- Respiratory frequency, $f = 20$ breaths/min (unchanged)\n- Final physiologic dead space, $V_{D,final} = 250$ mL\n\nWe calculate the final alveolar ventilation ($V_{A,final}$):\n$$V_{A,final} = (V_T - V_{D,final}) \\times f$$\n$$V_{A,final} = (500 \\text{ mL} - 250 \\text{ mL}) \\times 20 \\text{ min}^{-1}$$\n$$V_{A,final} = 250 \\text{ mL} \\times 20 \\text{ min}^{-1} = 5000 \\text{ mL/min}$$\n\nWith the initial and final alveolar ventilation rates calculated, we can now determine the new steady-state alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide, $P_{A,CO_2,final}$.
