This practice problem [@problem_id:4822123] demonstrates how to use the law of total probability to calculate the expected success rate of a standard therapy in a region with a known rate of clarithromycin resistance. This calculation bridges the gap between the efficacy of a drug in susceptible strains and its overall effectiveness in a real-world clinical setting.", "problem": "A gastroenterology clinic treats patients with peptic ulcer disease caused by Helicobacter pylori using standard triple therapy consisting of a Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI), amoxicillin, and clarithromycin. In a particular region, surveillance data show that the population prevalence of clarithromycin-resistant Helicobacter pylori is $25\\%$. In patients infected with clarithromycin-susceptible strains, the per-patient probability of eradication with this triple therapy is $0.85$. Clarithromycin resistance in Helicobacter pylori severely impairs macrolide binding to the ribosomal target, rendering clarithromycin effectively nonfunctional in the regimen; for the purpose of this calculation, assume that the eradication probability in resistant infections under this regimen is approximately $0$.\n\nAssume a randomly selected, treatment-naive patient from this region, perfect adherence, and that resistance status is the only determinant of efficacy in this simplified model. Using only fundamental probability concepts about mixtures of subpopulations, compute the expected eradication probability for triple therapy in this region. Express your final answer as a decimal with no units or percent sign. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for the expected eradication probability of triple therapy for *Helicobacter pylori* in a given patient population. This can be conceptualized as finding the overall probability of a successful outcome (eradication) in a population that is a mixture of two distinct subpopulations: those with clarithromycin-susceptible infections and those with clarithromycin-resistant infections. The law of total probability is the fundamental principle for solving this type of problem.\n\nLet's define the following events:\n- Let $E$ be the event that eradication is successful.\n- Let $S$ be the event that a patient is infected with a clarithromycin-susceptible strain of *H. pylori*.\n- Let $R$ be the event that a patient is infected with a clarithromycin-resistant strain of *H. pylori*.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n\n1.  The population prevalence of clarithromycin-resistant *H. pylori* is $25\\%$. This is the probability that a randomly selected patient has a resistant strain:\n    $$P(R) = 0.25$$\n\n2.  The set of all infected patients is partitioned into those with susceptible strains and those with resistant strains. These are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events. Therefore, the probability of a patient having a susceptible strain is complementary to having a resistant strain:\n    $$P(S) = 1 - P(R) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$$\n\n3.  The probability of eradication in patients with clarithromycin-susceptible strains is $0.85$. This is a conditional probability: the probability of eradication *given* that the strain is susceptible.\n    $$P(E|S) = 0.85$$\n\n4.  The probability of eradication in patients with clarithromycin-resistant strains is assumed to be $0$. This is also a conditional probability:\n    $$P(E|R) = 0$$\n\nThe overall probability of eradication, $P(E)$, for a randomly selected patient from this region can be calculated using the law of total probability. This law states that the total probability of an outcome is the sum of its probabilities across all partitions of the sample space. In this case, the partitions are the susceptible ($S$) and resistant ($R$) subpopulations.\n\nThe formula for the law of total probability is:\n$$P(E) = P(E|S)P(S) + P(E|R)P(R)$$\n\nThis formula represents a weighted average of the eradication probabilities for each subpopulation, where the weights are the prevalences of those subpopulations.\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into the formula:\n$$P(E) = (0.85)(0.75) + (0)(0.25)$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the product for the susceptible subpopulation:\n$$(0.85) \\times (0.75) = \\frac{85}{100} \\times \\frac{75}{100} = \\frac{17}{20} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{51}{80}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$$\\frac{51}{80} = 0.6375$$\n\nNext, we calculate the product for the resistant subpopulation:\n$$(0) \\times (0.25) = 0$$\n\nFinally, we sum the two terms to find the total probability of eradication:\n$$P(E) = 0.6375 + 0 = 0.6375$$\n\nThus, the expected eradication probability for triple therapy in this region is $0.6375$.
