In excitable tissues, conduction follows the principle that the time required to traverse a distance depends on velocity, and chemical synapses impose finite transmission delays. Consider a human subject in whom the axonal path length from the small intestine to the NTS is approximated as $L = 0.86$ meters, and the measured average conduction velocity of the relevant myelinated vagal afferent is $v = 3.8$ meters per second.

Butyrate is the primary oxidative substrate for colonocytes and influences epithelial barrier integrity and systemic signaling along the gut-brain axis.

The process can be broken down into sequential steps:\n\n1.  **Mass of each substrate fermented daily:**\n    For each substrate $i$ (where $i \\in \\{\\text{RS, IN, PE, AX}\\}$ for Resistant Starch, Inulin, Pectin, and Arabinoxylan, respectively), the mass ingested per day is $I_i$. A fraction $A_i$ of this mass arrives at the colon, and a fraction $K_i$ of the arrived mass is fermented. The total mass of substrate $i$ fermented per day, $M_{\\text{ferm}, i}$, is given by:\n    $$M_{\\text{ferm}, i} = I_i \\times A_i \\times K_i$$\n\n2.  **Total daily butyrate production in the colon lumen:**\n    The total production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) from $1$ gram of fermented substrate $i$ is given by the yield $Y_i$.

Let $f_B$ be the fraction of the active fermenting community composed of butyrate-producing taxa. Therefore, the amount of butyrate produced per day from the fermentation of substrate $i$, denoted $P_{\\text{butyrate}, i}$, is:\n    $$P_{\\text{butyrate}, i} = M_{\\text{ferm}, i} \\times Y_i \\times s_i \\times f_B$$\n    The total daily production of butyrate in the colon lumen, $P_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of contributions from all substrates:\n    $$P_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i} P_{\\text{butyrate}, i} = f_B \\sum_{i} (I_i \\times A_i \\times K_i \\times Y_i \\times s_i)$$\n\n3.  **Daily butyrate flux to colonocytes:**\n    A constant fraction $h$ of the luminal butyrate is consumed by microbial cross-feeding. The amount reaching the mucosa is thus $P_{\\text{total}} \\times (1 - h)$. Of this mucosa-accessible butyrate, a constant fraction $u$ is taken up by colonocytes.

For free plasma serotonin, the total amount in plasma is the product of its concentration $C_{\\mathrm{b}}(t)$ and the plasma volume $V_{\\mathrm{plasma}}$. The rate of change of this amount is equal to the rate of production minus the rate of removal.\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} (V_{\\mathrm{plasma}} C_{\\mathrm{b}}) = R - (\\text{Systemic Clearance Rate}) $$\nGiven that the systemic clearance is a first-order process, the rate of removal is proportional to the total amount present, with a rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{sys}}$.
