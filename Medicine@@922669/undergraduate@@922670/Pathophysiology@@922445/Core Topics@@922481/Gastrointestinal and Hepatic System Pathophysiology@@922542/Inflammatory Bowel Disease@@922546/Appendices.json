Consider a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model with linear kinetics and monoexponential decay (first-order elimination).

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of pharmacokinetics, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its language and formulation. It represents a standard problem in the field that can be solved through logical derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation and calculation of the steady-state trough concentration of infliximab. The model is a one-compartment model with first-order elimination following intravenous bolus doses.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental equation for the plasma concentration $C(t)$ at time $t$ after a single intravenous bolus dose $D$. Given a volume of distribution $V$ and an elimination rate constant $k$, the concentration is:\n$$ C(t) = \\frac{D}{V} \\exp(-kt) $$\nThe problem states that the drug is administered periodically with a dosing interval $\\tau$. At steady-state, the concentration profile is periodic. The trough concentration, $C_{ss, trough}$, is the minimum concentration, which occurs immediately before the administration of the next dose, i.e., at time $t = \\tau$ after the last dose.\n\nThe principle of superposition states that the total concentration at any time is the sum of the concentrations remaining from all previous doses. At steady-state, we consider an infinite series of doses having been administered. Let's calculate the trough concentration just before a dose. This concentration is the sum of the remnants of all prior doses. The most recent dose was administered at a time $\\tau$ ago, the one before that at $2\\tau$ ago, the one before that at $3\\tau$ ago, and so on, extending to an infinite past.\n\nThe concentration remaining from the dose administered $n\\tau$ in the past is given by $\\frac{D}{V} \\exp(-kn\\tau)$.

The sum of such a series is given by the formula $\\frac{r}{1-r}$, provided that $|r|<1$. Since $k > 0$ and $\\tau > 0$, the ratio $r = \\exp(-k\\tau)$ is between $0$ and $1$, so the series converges.\n\nSubstituting the formula for the sum of the geometric series, we obtain the expression for the steady-state trough concentration:\n$$ C_{ss, trough} = \\frac{D}{V} \\left( \\frac{\\exp(-k\\tau)}{1 - \\exp(-k\\tau)} \\right) $$\nThis expression is the derived formula for the steady-state trough concentration.\n\nNext, we calculate the numerical value using the provided data.\nThe givens are:\nPatient weight: $70$ kg\nDosage: $5$ mg/kg\nDosing interval: $\\tau = 8$ weeks\nClearance: $CL = 0.3$ L/day\nVolume of distribution: $V = 3$ L\nConversion: $1$ week = $7$ days\n\nFirst, we calculate the parameters for the formula:\n1.
