Imagine cutting the sphere of radius $r$ into two equal halves. The transmural pressure $P$ acts on the internal circular face of this conceptual cut, creating a force that tends to push the two hemispheres apart.\n\nThis separating force, $F_{pressure}$, is the product of the pressure $P$ and the projected area over which it acts, which is the area of a great circle of the sphere, $A_{circle} = \\pi r^2$.\n$$F_{pressure} = P \\cdot A_{circle} = P \\pi r^2$$\n\nThis separating force is balanced by the internal stress in the material of the wall, which acts along the circumference of the cut. This resisting force, $F_{wall}$, is the product of the circumferential wall stress $\\sigma$ and the cross-sectional area of the wall material, $A_{wall}$.\n\nSince the wall is assumed to be thin (i.e., thickness $t \\ll r$), the cross-sectional area of the wall can be approximated as the circumference of the sphere multiplied by the wall thickness $t$.\n$$A_{wall} \\approx (2 \\pi r) t$$\n\nThe total resisting force is therefore:\n$$F_{wall} = \\sigma \\cdot A_{wall} = \\sigma (2 \\pi r t)$$\n\nFor the hemisphere to be in mechanical equilibrium, the separating force must be equal to the resisting force:\n$$F_{pressure} = F_{wall}$$\n$$P \\pi r^2 = \\sigma (2 \\pi r t)$$\n\nWe can now solve for the circumferential wall stress, $\\sigma$:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{P \\pi r^2}{2 \\pi r t}$$\nCanceling terms ($\\pi$ and one factor of $r$), we arrive at the expression for circumferential stress in a thin-walled sphere, also known as the Law of Laplace for a sphere:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{Pr}{2t}$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Fold-Change in Wall Stress**\n\nWe are asked to calculate the fold-change in wall stress when the cecal diameter increases from $d_1 = 8 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$ to $d_2 = 12 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$. The problem states that the transmural pressure $P$ and the wall thickness $t$ remain constant during this distension.\n\nThe initial radius is $r_1 = \\frac{d_1}{2} = \\frac{8 \\ \\mathrm{cm}}{2} = 4 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$.\nThe final radius is $r_2 = \\frac{d_2}{2} = \\frac{12 \\ \\mathrm{cm}}{2} = 6 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nLet $\\sigma_1$ be the initial stress at radius $r_1$, and $\\sigma_2$ be the final stress at radius $r_2$. Using the derived formula:\n$$\\sigma_1 = \\frac{P r_1}{2t}$$\n$$\\sigma_2 = \\frac{P r_2}{2t}$$\n\nThe fold-change is the ratio of the final stress to the initial stress, $\\frac{\\sigma_2}{\\sigma_1}$.\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{\\sigma_2}{\\sigma_1} = \\frac{\\frac{P r_2}{2t}}{\\frac{P r_1}{2t}}$$\n\nSince $P$ and $t$ are constant, they cancel out from the ratio:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{r_2}{r_1}$$\n\nSubstituting the numerical values for the radii:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{6 \\ \\mathrm{cm}}{4 \\ \\mathrm{cm}} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = 1.500$$\nThis result demonstrates that for a given pressure, the wall stress increases linearly with the radius. This explains why the cecum, being the part of the colon with the largest diameter, experiences the highest wall stress and is therefore at the greatest risk of perforation during a distal obstruction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.500}$$", "id": "4801815"}, {"introduction": "To fully appreciate the mechanical risks, we must understand what drives the pressure increase within an obstructed segment, particularly in a dangerous closed-loop obstruction.

Express your final answer in $\\text{mmHg}$ and round to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the instantaneous increase in intraluminal pressure, $\\Delta P$, within a sealed segment of the small bowel following acute gas generation. The solution requires applying the principles of conservation of mass for the gas and the definition of volumetric compliance of the bowel wall, under the assumption of isothermal conditions.\n\nFirst, we establish the initial state of the system. The obstructed bowel segment is modeled as a cylinder. Its initial volume, $V_{bowel,0}$, is given by:\n$$ V_{bowel,0} = \\pi r_{0}^{2} L $$\nSubstituting the given values, $L = 25\\,\\text{cm}$ and $r_{0} = 1.8\\,\\text{cm}$:\n$$ V_{bowel,0} = \\pi (1.8\\,\\text{cm})^{2} (25\\,\\text{cm}) = \\pi (3.24\\,\\text{cm}^{2}) (25\\,\\text{cm}) = 81 \\pi\\,\\text{cm}^{3} $$\nSince $1\\,\\text{cm}^{3}$ is equivalent to $1\\,\\text{ml}$, the initial volume is $V_{bowel,0} = 81 \\pi\\,\\text{ml}$.\nThe initial pressure is $P_{0} = 8.0\\,\\text{mmHg}$.\n\nThe problem states that the process is isothermal. For an ideal gas at constant temperature, the number of moles, $n$, is directly proportional to the product of pressure $P$ and volume $V_{gas}$ ($PV_{gas} = nRT$). Therefore, we can use the quantity $PV_{gas}$ as a measure of the amount of gas.\n\nWe apply the principle of conservation of mass to the gas in the loop. The total amount of gas in the final state is the sum of the gas initially present and the gas generated by fermentation.\nLet the initial state be denoted by subscript $0$ and the final state by subscript $1$.\nThe initial \"amount\" of gas is proportional to $P_{0} V_{bowel,0}$.\nThe generated gas has a volume $V = 60.0\\,\\text{ml}$ when measured at the baseline pressure $P_{0}$. Thus, the \"amount\" of gas added is proportional to $P_{0}V$.\nThe final pressure is $P_{1} = P_{0} + \\Delta P$, and the final volume of the bowel is $V_{bowel,1}$. The final \"amount\" of gas is proportional to $P_{1}V_{bowel,1}$.\n\nConservation of mass for the gas implies:\n$$ P_{1}V_{bowel,1} = P_{0}V_{bowel,0} + P_{0}V $$\nThis equation can be rewritten as:\n$$ P_{1}V_{bowel,1} = P_{0}(V_{bowel,0} + V) $$\n\nNext, we relate the change in bowel volume to the change in pressure using the definition of compliance, $C$. Compliance is defined as the change in volume per unit change in pressure:\n$$ C = \\frac{\\Delta V_{bowel}}{\\Delta P} $$\nWhere $\\Delta V_{bowel} = V_{bowel,1} - V_{bowel,0}$. Rearranging this gives the change in bowel volume:\n$$ \\Delta V_{bowel} = C \\Delta P $$\nThe final volume of the bowel is therefore:\n$$ V_{bowel,1} = V_{bowel,0} + \\Delta V_{bowel} = V_{bowel,0} + C \\Delta P $$\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for $P_{1}$ and $V_{bowel,1}$ into the conservation equation:\n$$ (P_{0} + \\Delta P)(V_{bowel,0} + C \\Delta P) = P_{0}(V_{bowel,0} + V) $$\nExpanding the left side of the equation yields:\n$$ P_{0}V_{bowel,0} + P_{0}C\\Delta P + V_{bowel,0}\\Delta P + C(\\Delta P)^{2} = P_{0}V_{bowel,0} + P_{0}V $$\nThe term $P_{0}V_{bowel,0}$ cancels from both sides:\n$$ P_{0}C\\Delta P + V_{bowel,0}\\Delta P + C(\\Delta P)^{2} = P_{0}V $$\nThis is a quadratic equation in $\\Delta P$:\n$$ C(\\Delta P)^{2} + (P_{0}C + V_{bowel,0})\\Delta P - P_{0}V = 0 $$\n\nThe problem statement specifies that \"changes are sufficiently small to justify linearization\". This instruction implies that second-order terms in the change $\\Delta P$ can be neglected. Therefore, we discard the $C(\\Delta P)^{2}$ term. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ (P_{0}C + V_{bowel,0})\\Delta P \\approx P_{0}V $$\nSolving for $\\Delta P$:\n$$ \\Delta P = \\frac{P_{0}V}{P_{0}C + V_{bowel,0}} $$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values into this expression.
