However, simply looking at the percentage of new red blood cells (reticulocytes) can be misleading in an anemic patient.

Laboratory data show a hematocrit (Hct) of $24\\%$ and an automated reticulocyte percentage of $8\\%$.

For grading, report only the RPI value.", "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated against the required criteria.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\nThe following data are provided in the problem statement:\n-   Patient's hematocrit, $Hct_{\\text{patient}} = 24\\%$.\n-   Automated reticulocyte percentage, $R_{\\%} = 8\\%$.\n-   Normal adult hematocrit, $Hct_{\\text{normal}} = 45\\%$.\n-   Peripheral blood maturation correction factor, $F_{\\text{maturation}} = 2$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in standard hematology principles. The concepts of correcting the reticulocyte percentage for the degree of anemia and for the prolonged maturation time of \"shift\" reticulocytes are fundamental to the clinical assessment of anemias. The given laboratory values are clinically plausible for a case of significant hemolysis.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data to calculate the Reticulocyte Production Index (RPI) using established hematological formulas. A unique and meaningful solution exists.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in objective, clinical language, free of subjective claims or bias.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, completely formalizable, and based on realistic clinical data.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe goal is to compute the Reticulocyte Production Index (RPI) to assess the adequacy of the bone marrow's response to anemia. The calculation proceeds in two stages.\n\n**Stage 1: Calculation of the Corrected Reticulocyte Count (CRC)**\n\nThe raw reticulocyte percentage, $R_{\\%}$, is misleading in anemic states. It represents the number of reticulocytes per $100$ red blood cells (RBCs). When the total number of RBCs is low (i.e., in anemia), this percentage is artificially inflated even if the absolute number of reticulocytes produced per day remains constant. The Corrected Reticulocyte Count (CRC) adjusts for this dilutional effect by normalizing the patient's reticulocyte percentage to what it would be at a normal hematocrit level.\n\nThe formula for the CRC is:\n$$\nCRC = R_{\\%} \\times \\frac{Hct_{\\text{patient}}}{Hct_{\\text{normal}}}\n$$\n\nUsing the given values:\n-   $R_{\\%} = 8$ (as a percentage value)\n-   $Hct_{\\text{patient}} = 24$ (as a percentage value)\n-   $Hct_{\\text{normal}} = 45$ (as a percentage value)\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$\nCRC = 8 \\times \\frac{24}{45}\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction $\\frac{24}{45} = \\frac{3 \\times 8}{3 \\times 15} = \\frac{8}{15}$.\n$$\nCRC = 8 \\times \\frac{8}{15} = \\frac{64}{15}\n$$\nThe corrected reticulocyte count is $\\frac{64}{15}\\%$, which is approximately $4.267\\%$.\n\n**Stage 2: Calculation of the Reticulocyte Production Index (RPI)**\n\nIn response to severe anemia, the bone marrow releases reticulocytes prematurely. These \"shift\" reticulocytes take longer to mature in the peripheral blood than the usual $1$ day. This causes an accumulation of reticulocytes in the circulation, meaning the daily count (even the CRC) reflects more than a single day's production. The RPI corrects for this phenomenon by dividing the CRC by a maturation factor, $F_{\\text{maturation}}$, which estimates the maturation time in days based on the hematocrit level.\n\nThe formula for the RPI is:\n$$\nRPI = \\frac{CRC}{F_{\\text{maturation}}}\n$$\n\nUsing the calculated CRC and the given maturation factor:\n-   $CRC = \\frac{64}{15}$\n-   $F_{\\text{maturation}} = 2$\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\nRPI = \\frac{\\frac{64}{15}}{2} = \\frac{64}{15 \\times 2} = \\frac{64}{30} = \\frac{32}{15}\n$$\n\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we convert the fraction to a decimal and round to three significant figures as requested.\n$$\nRPI = \\frac{32}{15} \\approx 2.1333...\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $2.13$.\n\n**Interpretation**\n\nAn RPI value greater than $2$ (or $3$ by some criteria) in the setting of anemia indicates an adequate or hyperproliferative bone marrow response. A value less than $2$ suggests a hypoproliferative or inadequate response. The calculated RPI of $2.13$ signifies that the bone marrow is appropriately increasing its production of red blood cells in response to the hemolysis, which is the expected finding in a hemolytic anemia where the marrow itself is functionally intact.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.13}$$", "id": "4789499"}, {"introduction": "A key challenge in diagnosing hemolysis is distinguishing a true disease process within the body (in vivo) from red blood cell damage that occurs in the test tube after blood collection (in vitro).

Developing this systematic approach is essential for ensuring diagnostic accuracy and patient safety.", "problem": "A hospitalized patient undergoing evaluation for anemia has blood drawn in the emergency department. The primary tube shows visually pink-red plasma after centrifugation, and the basic metabolic panel reports an elevated plasma potassium concentration. The clinician must decide whether there is true in vivo hemolysis causing clinically relevant findings, versus in vitro sample hemolysis artifact from phlebotomy or handling. Design a sequential laboratory algorithm to distinguish in vivo hemolysis from sample hemolysis artifact, specifically incorporating repeat sampling, plasma color inspection, and potassium comparison, and justify each step using fundamental principles and well-tested facts. Choose the option that presents the most scientifically sound sequence of steps and correct justifications.\n\nFoundational facts to consider include: red blood cells (RBCs) maintain a high intracellular potassium concentration relative to plasma; free hemoglobin strongly absorbs light, imparting pink-red color to plasma when released; true intravascular hemolysis releases cell contents into the circulation and consumes haptoglobin; and serum clotting may artifactually raise measured potassium. Any proposed algorithm should be internally consistent and feasible in clinical laboratory practice.\n\nWhich option is best?\n\nA. Inspect plasma color after centrifugation, then repeat sampling with optimal phlebotomy technique, and compare potassium results across specimen types and timing; if hemolysis persists despite proper technique and biochemical markers of hemolysis indicate in vivo RBC destruction, conclude true hemolysis; otherwise classify as artifact. Specifically: Step $1$: Perform visual inspection for hemolysis (pink-red plasma) because free hemoglobin increases absorbance and indicates cell lysis in the specimen. Step $2$: Obtain a carefully collected repeat sample (large-bore needle, minimal tourniquet time, gentle inversion, rapid transport) to minimize in vitro lysis. Step $3$: Compare measured potassium ($[\\text{K}^+]$) across an immediately analyzed whole-blood gas sample, plasma, and serum; true physiologic hyperkalemia will elevate $[\\text{K}^+]$ concordantly, whereas in vitro hemolysis often shows higher serum $[\\text{K}^+]$ (release during clotting) and normalization in rapidly analyzed whole blood. Step $4$: Correlate with intravascular hemolysis biomarkers: decreased haptoglobin (binding free hemoglobin), increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from RBC cytosol, increased unconjugated bilirubin from heme catabolism, reticulocytosis, and peripheral smear changes; if these persist when samples are not hemolyzed, infer in vivo hemolysis. Step $5$: If repeat samples show clear plasma and normalized $[\\text{K}^+]$ with absent hemolysis biomarkers, conclude sample artifact.\n\nB.

Repeat sampling is essential, but plasma color inspection is unnecessary because color depends on lighting; focus the algorithm on comparing serum potassium alone between two draws: if the second serum $[\\text{K}^+]$ remains elevated, conclude in vivo hemolysis; do not assess intravascular hemolysis biomarkers because they are nonspecific.\n\nE. Begin with an electrocardiogram (ECG) to evaluate hyperkalemia, then order serum sodium comparison rather than potassium because sodium is more abundant; if serum sodium is unchanged between samples, infer artifact; avoid plasma versus serum comparison and omit haptoglobin because it is an acute phase reactant and cannot help distinguish hemolysis.\n\nAssume the laboratory can provide an immediate whole-blood potassium using a blood gas analyzer, plasma and serum chemistry panels processed per protocol, and standard hemolysis biomarkers. All numerical measurements (for example, potassium values such as $4.0\\,\\mathrm{mEq/L}$ versus $6.0\\,\\mathrm{mEq/L}$) should be interpreted according to established clinical reference intervals, but the algorithm selection must rest on pathophysiological reasoning rather than memorized cutoffs.", "solution": "The user has requested a meticulous validation of the problem statement, followed by a detailed solution and evaluation of the provided options.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Scenario:** A hospitalized patient is being evaluated for anemia.\n- **Initial Laboratory Findings:**\n    1. An initial blood draw shows \"visually pink-red plasma after centrifugation\".\n    2.

Red blood cells ($\\mathrm{RBCs}$) maintain a high intracellular potassium concentration relative to plasma.\n    2. Free hemoglobin \"strongly absorbs light, imparting pink-red color to plasma when released\".\n    3.

It is based on established principles of hematology, pathophysiology, and clinical laboratory medicine. The distinction between in vivo and in vitro hemolysis and the associated finding of pseudohyperkalemia is a classic and critically important diagnostic challenge. The \"foundational facts\" provided are all correct and central to the problem. $\\mathrm{RBCs}$ indeed have a potassium concentration ($[\\text{K}^+]$) of approximately $100\\,\\mathrm{mEq/L}$, whereas normal plasma $[\\text{K}^+]$ is around $3.5-5.0\\,\\mathrm{mEq/L}$. Lysis of even a small fraction of $\\mathrm{RBCs}$ in vitro can therefore dramatically and artifactually elevate measured plasma or serum $[\\text{K}^+]$. The roles of hemoglobin in plasma color, haptoglobin consumption, and lactate dehydrogenase ($\\mathrm{LDH}$) release are all cornerstones of hemolysis investigation.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It asks for the selection of the most scientifically sound algorithm from a set of options, based on a clear clinical scenario and a set of established principles. A unique, best answer can be determined through logical deduction based on these principles.\n- **Objective:** The language is objective and clinical. It avoids subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and free of contradictions or critical omissions. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is to devise a logical sequence of actions to differentiate a systemic disease process (in vivo hemolysis) from a pre-analytical sample collection/handling error (in vitro hemolysis). The initial findings of pink-red plasma (hemolysis) and hyperkalemia are ambiguous, as both can result from either cause.\n\nA sound algorithm should proceed from the most likely and easily correctable cause to more complex and specific investigations. The most common cause of a hemolyzed sample with elevated potassium is, by far, in vitro artifact.\n\n1.  **Initial Observation and Hypothesis Generation:** The presence of pink-red plasma confirms the presence of free hemoglobin, indicating $\\mathrm{RBC}$ lysis. The elevated plasma $[\\text{K}^+]$ is consistent with this lysis. The primary hypothesis is artifactual hemolysis, but true in vivo hemolysis must be ruled out.\n\n2.  **Addressing Pre-analytical Error:** The first and most crucial step is to rule out common pre-analytical (in vitro) causes. This is best achieved by obtaining a fresh sample collected under optimal conditions (e.g., using a larger bore needle, minimizing tourniquet time, filling tubes correctly, gentle handling). If the artifact is eliminated, the problem is solved.\n\n3.  **Advanced Analyte Comparison:** If a repeat sample is necessary, one can leverage different sample types to unmask artifact. Due to the massive gradient of $[\\text{K}^+]$ between $\\mathrm{RBCs}$ and plasma, even minor lysis in the tube significantly alters the measured plasma/serum $[\\text{K}^+]$.\n    - A **whole blood gas sample**, analyzed immediately, provides a $[\\text{K}^+]$ value from plasma in its \"native\" state before significant post-phlebotomy lysis can occur. This is often taken as the closest approximation of the patient's true circulating $[\\text{K}^+]$.\n    - A **plasma** sample (from a heparinized tube) avoids potassium release during clotting but is still subject to artifact from traumatic phlebotomy.\n    - A **serum** sample can have a slightly higher $[\\text{K}^+]$ than a corresponding plasma sample even in healthy individuals, as some potassium is released from platelets and $\\mathrm{RBCs}$ during the clotting process. This effect is magnified in a hemolyzed sample.\n    - A large discrepancy, such as an elevated serum or plasma $[\\text{K}^+]$ with a normal whole blood $[\\text{K}^+]$, is pathognomonic for pseudohyperkalemia due to in vitro hemolysis. Concordant elevation across all sample types would suggest true hyperkalemia.\n\n4.  **Confirmation of In Vivo Hemolysis:** If hemolysis and/or hyperkalemia persist in a carefully collected repeat sample, the focus must shift to confirming a systemic, in vivo process. This requires measuring specific biomarkers that reflect the physiological consequences of intravascular or extravascular hemolysis.\n    - **Haptoglobin:** This plasma protein binds free hemoglobin. In significant intravascular hemolysis, it is consumed, leading to low or undetectable levels. This is a highly specific marker.\n    - **Lactate Dehydrogenase ($\\mathrm{LDH}$):** This enzyme is abundant in $\\mathrm{RBCs}$ and is released upon their destruction. Elevated $\\mathrm{LDH}$ is a sensitive but less specific marker of hemolysis.\n    - **Unconjugated (Indirect) Bilirubin:** The heme moiety of hemoglobin is metabolized to bilirubin. Hemolysis can overwhelm the liver's capacity to conjugate bilirubin, leading to an increase in the unconjugated fraction.\n    - **Reticulocyte Count:** Anemia from hemolysis stimulates the bone marrow to release immature $\\mathrm{RBCs}$ (reticulocytes), leading to reticulocytosis.\n    - **Peripheral Blood Smear:** Microscopic examination can reveal characteristic $\\mathrm{RBC}$ morphologies (e.g., schistocytes, spherocytes) that point to a specific cause of hemolysis.\n\n5.  **Synthesis:** An algorithm that combines these steps in a logical sequence (rule out artifact -> perform robust comparisons -> confirm with specific biomarkers) is optimal.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Inspect plasma color after centrifugation, then repeat sampling with optimal phlebotomy technique, and compare potassium results across specimen types and timing; if hemolysis persists despite proper technique and biochemical markers of hemolysis indicate in vivo RBC destruction, conclude true hemolysis; otherwise classify as artifact. [...]**\n\n- **Step $1$:** Correct. Visual inspection identifies hemolysis. The justification (free hemoglobin increases absorbance) is accurate.\n- **Step $2$:** Correct. Repeating the sample with optimal technique is the single most important step to rule out artifact. The described technique is appropriate.\n- **Step $3$:** Correct. Comparing $[\\text{K}^+]$ across whole-blood gas, plasma, and serum is a powerful and scientifically rigorous method to distinguish true hyperkalemia from pseudohyperkalemia. The justification is precise: true physiologic hyperkalemia will be concordant, whereas in vitro hemolysis creates discordance.\n- **Step $4$:** Correct. This step accurately lists the key confirmatory biomarkers for in vivo hemolysis (haptoglobin, $\\mathrm{LDH}$, bilirubin, reticulocytes, smear) and correctly states their purpose.\n- **Step $5$:** Correct. This provides the logical conclusion if the repeat sample normalizes, confirming an initial artifact.\n- **Verdict:** This option outlines a comprehensive, logically sequenced, and scientifically sound algorithm. It correctly follows the principles of laboratory medicine by first excluding pre-analytical error before proceeding to more complex diagnostic tests. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Rely on a single elevated plasma potassium result to diagnose in vivo hemolysis; skip plasma color inspection and repeat sampling, and proceed to treat hyperkalemia. [...]**\n\n- **Analysis:** This approach is fundamentally flawed and dangerous. It ignores pseudohyperkalemia, an extremely common laboratory artifact. Acting on an unverified, artifactual lab result by treating for hyperkalemia (e.g., with insulin, glucose, and cation exchangers) could induce severe, life-threatening iatrogenic hypokalemia. This violates the primary directive to \"first, do no harm.\"\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Base the decision exclusively on plasma color; if plasma is pink-red on initial draw, conclude true hemolysis and order a direct antiglobulin test (DAT) to subtype etiology; [...]**\n\n- **Analysis:** This is incorrect because, as established, plasma color (hemolysis) does not distinguish between an in vivo and in vitro origin. A traumatic blood draw is a very common cause of pink-red plasma. Proceeding directly to a $\\mathrm{DAT}$ without first ruling out a sample artifact is an inefficient and illogical use of laboratory resources.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Repeat sampling is essential, but plasma color inspection is unnecessary because color depends on lighting; focus the algorithm on comparing serum potassium alone between two draws: [...]**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option contains multiple errors. First, while lighting can affect perception, visual hemolysis inspection is a standard, valuable, and semi-quantitative laboratory practice. Ignoring it discards useful data. Second, relying on serum $[\\text{K}^+]$ alone is suboptimal. The process of clotting can itself release potassium, confounding the result. A comparison between serum, plasma, and especially immediate whole-blood $[\\text{K}^+]$ is far more discriminatory. Third, dismissing intravascular hemolysis biomarkers as \"nonspecific\" is wrong. While $\\mathrm{LDH}$ alone has low specificity, a depleted haptoglobin level is a strong and specific indicator of intravascular hemolysis.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Begin with an electrocardiogram (ECG) to evaluate hyperkalemia, then order serum sodium comparison rather than potassium because sodium is more abundant; [...]**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option is riddled with scientific errors. An $\\mathrm{ECG}$ evaluates the cardiac *consequences* of hyperkalemia but does nothing to establish its *etiology* (true vs. pseudo). Comparing serum sodium ($[\\text{Na}^+]$) is biochemically nonsensical for this purpose; $\\mathrm{RBC}$ lysis releases potassium, not a significant amount of sodium relative to the high extracellular concentration. Dismissing haptoglobin because it is an acute phase reactant reflects a misunderstanding of its role; its consumption during hemolysis causes a profound decrease that far outweighs any inflammatory increase, making it a critical diagnostic marker.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4789527"}, {"introduction": "Once true hemolysis is confirmed, the investigation turns to understanding its specific characteristics.

It is scientifically grounded in established pathophysiological and pharmacokinetic principles, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively formulated. It presents a solvable, multi-step quantitative problem that is neither trivial nor based on unsound premises.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts: first, a qualitative inference of the location of hemolysis based on the provided laboratory values, and second, a quantitative estimation of the steady-state plasma free hemoglobin concentration using a mass-balance model.\n\n**Part 1: Inference of the Hemolysis Compartment**\n\nThe pattern of laboratory results provides clear indications about the nature of the hemolytic process.\n1.  **Elevated Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH):** The given LDH is $1200~\\text{U/L}$, which is significantly elevated (a typical reference range is approximately $140-280~\\text{U/L}$). LDH is an intracellular enzyme released upon cell lysis. While not specific to red blood cells (RBCs), its marked elevation is a common feature of significant hemolysis.\n2.  **Elevated Unconjugated Bilirubin:** The total bilirubin is $4.0~\\text{mg/dL}$ and the direct (conjugated) bilirubin is $0.8~\\text{mg/dL}$. Unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) concentration, $C_B$, is the difference: $C_B = 4.0 - 0.8 = 3.2~\\text{mg/dL}$. This is substantially higher than the normal baseline of $0.5~\\text{mg/dL}$. UCB is the product of heme catabolism from hemoglobin breakdown and its elevation reflects a production rate that exceeds the liver's conjugation capacity.\n3.  **Depleted Haptoglobin:** The haptoglobin level is given as $ 10~\\text{mg/dL}$, which is essentially undetectable. Haptoglobin is a plasma protein that specifically binds free hemoglobin released into the circulation, forming a complex that is rapidly cleared by the reticuloendothelial system.\n\nThe combination of these three findings, particularly the severe depletion of haptoglobin, is the classic signature of **intravascular hemolysis**. In this process, RBCs lyse directly within the bloodstream, releasing large amounts of hemoglobin into the plasma. This free hemoglobin quickly saturates and consumes the entire circulating pool of haptoglobin. In contrast, extravascular hemolysis (occurring primarily within macrophages of the spleen and liver) involves phagocytosis of RBCs, so most hemoglobin is catabolized intracellularly, leading to a much smaller release of free hemoglobin into the plasma and thus a less dramatic a reduction in haptoglobin. Therefore, the predominant compartment of hemolysis is intravascular.\n\n**Part 2: Estimation of Steady-State Plasma Free Hemoglobin Concentration**\n\nThe estimation is based on the principle of conservation of mass at steady state, where the rate of production of a substance equals its rate of elimination. We will connect the rate of bilirubin production to the rate of hemoglobin destruction.\n\nLet $C_B$ be the measured unconjugated bilirubin concentration ($3.2~\\text{mg/dL}$) and $C_{B0}$ be the normal baseline concentration ($0.5~\\text{mg/dL}$). The excess bilirubin concentration due to hemolysis is $\\Delta C_B$.\n$$ \\Delta C_B = C_B - C_{B0} = 3.2 \\, \\text{mg/dL} - 0.5 \\, \\text{mg/dL} = 2.7 \\, \\text{mg/dL} $$\nThe problem states that the hepatic elimination of UCB follows first-order kinetics with a rate constant $k_B = 1.0~\\text{day}^{-1}$. At steady state, the rate of production of bilirubin from hemolysis, $R_{prod, B}$, must equal its rate of elimination. The total amount of excess UCB in the plasma volume $V_p$ is $\\Delta C_B \\times V_p$.\nThe rate of elimination is the rate constant multiplied by the total amount of substance:\n$$ R_{prod, B} = k_B \\times (\\Delta C_B \\times V_p) $$\nThis rate is in units of mass per time (e.g., mg/day).\n\nTo relate hemoglobin destruction to bilirubin production, we must use molar quantities. Let $M_{\\mathrm{Hb}}$ be the molar mass of hemoglobin ($64{,}500~\\text{g/mol}$) and $M_{\\mathrm{bilirubin}}$ be the molar mass of bilirubin ($584~\\text{g/mol}$). The molar rate of production of bilirubin, $\\dot{n}_{prod, B}$, is:\n$$ \\dot{n}_{prod, B} = \\frac{R_{prod, B}}{M_{\\mathrm{bilirubin}}} = \\frac{k_B \\Delta C_B V_p}{M_{\\mathrm{bilirubin}}} $$\nAccording to the problem's stoichiometry, one mole of hemoglobin tetramer yields four moles of bilirubin. Therefore, the molar rate of hemoglobin destruction, $\\dot{n}_{destruct, Hb}$, is one-fourth of the molar rate of bilirubin production:\n$$ \\dot{n}_{destruct, Hb} = \\frac{1}{4} \\dot{n}_{prod, B} = \\frac{k_B \\Delta C_B V_p}{4 M_{\\mathrm{bilirubin}}} $$\nThe mass rate of hemoglobin destruction, $R_{destruct, Hb}$, is this molar rate multiplied by the molar mass of hemoglobin:\n$$ R_{destruct, Hb} = \\dot{n}_{destruct, Hb} \\times M_{\\mathrm{Hb}} = \\frac{k_B \\Delta C_B V_p M_{\\mathrm{Hb}}}{4 M_{\\mathrm{bilirubin}}} $$\nAt steady state, the rate at which free hemoglobin is released into the plasma from hemolysis must equal its rate of clearance from the plasma. Let $C_{\\mathrm{Hb}}$ be the steady-state concentration of free plasma hemoglobin we seek to find. The clearance of free hemoglobin is also a first-order process, with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{Hb}} = 12~\\text{day}^{-1}$. The total amount of free hemoglobin in plasma is $C_{\\mathrm{Hb}} \\times V_p$. The rate of clearance, $R_{clear, Hb}$, is:\n$$ R_{clear, Hb} = k_{\\mathrm{Hb}} \\times (C_{\\mathrm{Hb}} \\times V_p) $$\nEquating the rate of hemoglobin release (which equals its destruction rate) to its clearance rate:\n$$ R_{destruct, Hb} = R_{clear, Hb} $$\n$$ \\frac{k_B \\Delta C_B V_p M_{\\mathrm{Hb}}}{4 M_{\\mathrm{bilirubin}}} = k_{\\mathrm{Hb}} C_{\\mathrm{Hb}} V_p $$\nThe plasma volume $V_p$ conveniently cancels from both sides of the equation. This yields a direct relationship between the concentrations:\n$$ \\frac{k_B \\Delta C_B M_{\\mathrm{Hb}}}{4 M_{\\mathrm{bilirubin}}} = k_{\\mathrm{Hb}} C_{\\mathrm{Hb}} $$\nSolving for the steady-state free hemoglobin concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{Hb}}$:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{Hb}} = \\frac{k_B}{k_{\\mathrm{Hb}}} \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{Hb}}}{4 M_{\\mathrm{bilirubin}}} \\Delta C_B $$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values into this expression. The units of the rate constants ($\\text{day}^{-1}$) and molar masses ($\\text{g/mol}$) will cancel, leaving $C_{\\mathrm{Hb}}$ in the same units as $\\Delta C_B$ (mg/dL).\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{Hb}} = \\frac{1.0 \\, \\text{day}^{-1}}{12 \\, \\text{day}^{-1}} \\times \\frac{64500 \\, \\text{g/mol}}{4 \\times 584 \\, \\text{g/mol}} \\times (2.7 \\, \\text{mg/dL}) $$\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{Hb}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{64500}{2336}\\right) \\times 2.7 \\, \\text{mg/dL} $$\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{Hb}} \\approx (0.083333) \\times (27.6113) \\times 2.7 \\, \\text{mg/dL} $$\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{Hb}} \\approx 2.3009 \\times 2.7 \\, \\text{mg/dL} $$\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{Hb}} \\approx 6.2125 \\, \\text{mg/dL} $$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, the estimated steady-state plasma free hemoglobin concentration is $6.21$ mg/dL.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.21}$$", "id": "4789533"}]}
