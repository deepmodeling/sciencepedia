Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) is a common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The subclassification into Germinal Center B-cell (GCB) and non-Germinal Center B-cell (non-GCB) subtypes using immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a routine practice based on the algorithm developed by Hans et al. (2004), which serves as a surrogate for the gold standard of gene expression profiling (GEP). The markers used—CD10, BCL6, and MUM1 (also known as IRF4)—are the standard components of this algorithm. The cutoff of $\\geq 30\\%$ is the specific threshold defined in the original Hans paper. All elements are factually and scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

It is a well-defined problem in medical diagnostics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is valid. A definitive solution can be derived by applying the specified algorithm to the given data.\n\n---\n\n## Derivation of Solution\n\nThe classification of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) into Germinal Center B-cell (GCB) and non-Germinal Center B-cell (non-GCB) subtypes using the Hans algorithm is based on a sequential evaluation of the immunohistochemical expression of CD10, BCL6, and MUM1.\n\nThe Hans algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Evaluate CD10 expression.**\n    -   If CD10 is positive ($\\geq 30\\%$ of tumor cells), the case is classified as **GCB** subtype. The algorithm terminates.\n\n2.  **If CD10 is negative, evaluate BCL6 expression.**\n    -   If BCL6 is negative ($< 30\\%$ of tumor cells), the case is classified as **non-GCB** subtype. The algorithm terminates.\n    -   If BCL6 is positive ($\\geq 30\\%$ of tumor cells), proceed to the next step.\n\n3.  **If CD10 is negative and BCL6 is positive, evaluate MUM1 expression.**\n    -   If MUM1 is negative ($< 30\\%$ of tumor cells), the case is classified as **GCB** subtype.\n    -   If MUM1 is positive ($\\geq 30\\%$ of tumor cells), the case is classified as **non-GCB** subtype.\n\nNow, we apply the patient's data to this algorithm:\n\n-   **Given IHC results**:\n    -   CD10: negative\n    -   BCL6: positive ($60\\% \\geq 30\\%$)\n    -   MUM1: positive ($50\\% \\geq 30\\%$)\n\n**Applying the algorithm step-by-step**:\n\n1.  **CD10 status**: The tumor is CD10 negative. Therefore, we do not classify it as GCB at this step and must proceed.\n\n2.  **BCL6 status**: Since CD10 is negative, we next check BCL6. The tumor is BCL6 positive. Therefore, we do not classify it as non-GCB at this step and must proceed.\n\n3.  **MUM1 status**: Since CD10 is negative and BCL6 is positive, we finally check MUM1. The tumor is MUM1 positive.\n\nFollowing this path (CD10 negative $\\rightarrow$ BCL6 positive $\\rightarrow$ MUM1 positive), the Hans algorithm classifies the case as **non-Germinal Center B-cell (non-GCB) subtype**.\n\n## Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Germinal Center B-cell (GCB) subtype, because BCL6 positivity indicates germinal center derivation even when CD10 is negative and MUM1 is positive.**\n-   The classification of GCB is incorrect. As derived above, the correct classification is non-GCB.\n-   The justification is invalid within the context of the Hans algorithm. Although BCL6 is a germinal center marker, for a CD10-negative case, the algorithm's final decision depends on the MUM1 status. Specifically, the combination of CD10 negative, BCL6 positive, and MUM1 positive defines the non-GCB subtype, not the GCB subtype.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Non-Germinal Center B-cell (non-GCB; activated B-cell-like) subtype, because absence of CD10 followed by presence of MUM1 defines non-GCB in the Hans algorithm regardless of BCL6 status.**\n-   The classification of non-GCB is correct.\n-   The justification is logically sound in the context of this case. Let's analyze it: \"absence of CD10 followed by presence of MUM1 defines non-GCB... regardless of BCL6 status.\" In the Hans algorithm, if a case is CD10 negative, we proceed to BCL6.\n    -   If BCL6 is negative, the case is non-GCB. MUM1 is not even tested.\n    -   If BCL6 is positive, we test MUM1. If MUM1 is positive (as in this case), the case is non-GCB.\n    -   Therefore, for any CD10-negative case, if MUM1 is positive, the final classification will always be non-GCB. If BCL6 were negative, it would be non-GCB. If BCL6 were positive, it would also be non-GCB. The justification correctly identifies the determinative role of MUM1 positivity in a CD10-negative setting.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Unclassifiable by the Hans algorithm, because conflicting expression of BCL6 and MUM1 requires gene-expression profiling rather than IHC surrogates.**\n-   The conclusion that the case is \"unclassifiable\" is incorrect. The Hans algorithm is specifically designed to resolve such immunophenotypes into a definitive category. The combination CD10-, BCL6+, MUM1+ has a definite outcome (non-GCB).\n-   Such expression is not considered \"conflicting\" in a way that makes the algorithm fail; it is a recognized pattern with a specific classification.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Germinal Center B-cell (GCB) subtype, because two of three markers are positive and majority positivity rules apply for classification.**\n-   The classification of GCB is incorrect.\n-   The justification is fundamentally wrong. The Hans algorithm is a sequential, hierarchical decision tree, not a voting system or a \"majority rules\" classification. The order in which the markers are evaluated is critical. Applying a simple count of positive markers (BCL6 and MUM1 are positive, CD10 is negative) is not how the algorithm works and leads to an incorrect conclusion.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4413857"}, {"introduction": "Once a lymphoma is diagnosed and subtyped, clinicians must determine its extent and predict its behavior to choose the best treatment strategy.

These include the cervical, axillary, and mediastinal nodes (all located above the diaphragm), as well as the para-aortic and mesenteric nodes (located below the diaphragm). Disease involvement on both sides of the diaphragm defines at least Stage III disease.\n    -   Involvement above diaphragm: Cervical, axillary, mediastinal.\n    -   Involvement below diaphragm: Para-aortic, mesenteric.\n    This bilateral involvement satisfies the criterion for Stage III.\n\n*   **Extranodal (E) Involvement:** The problem states there is extranodal involvement in two sites: the gastric wall and the bone marrow. According to the Ann Arbor classification, disseminated involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs, with or without associated lymph node involvement, constitutes Stage IV disease. Positive bone marrow involvement is a definitive criterion for Stage IV.\n\n*   **Systemic Symptoms (A/B Classification):** The patient reports fever and drenching night sweats. These are two of the three classic \"B symptoms\" (the third being an unexplained weight loss of more than $10\\%$ of body weight in the preceding $6$ months). The presence of any of these symptoms adds the \"B\" suffix to the stage.\n\n*   **Final Stage:** Based on disseminated extranodal involvement (bone marrow) and the presence of B symptoms, the patient's lymphoma is classified as **Stage IVB**.\n\n**Part 2: Age-Adjusted International Prognostic Index (aaIPI) Calculation**\n\nThe problem specifies the use of the Age-Adjusted IPI (aaIPI), which is designed for patients aged $60$ years or younger.

It is a standard application of differential equations to model a real-world biological phenomenon based on established scientific principles. The solution process may now proceed.\n\n**Part (a): Derivation of the Growth Equation**\n\nThe statement \"the instantaneous growth rate is proportional to the current malignant cell mass\" is translated into a differential equation. Let $M(t)$ be the mass at time $t$. The instantaneous growth rate is $\\frac{dM}{dt}$. The proportionality to the mass $M$ is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = k M(t)\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the constant of proportionality, representing the net proliferation rate constant with units of inverse time. This is a first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. It can be solved by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{M} = k \\, dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial state $(0, M_0)$ to a general state $(t, M(t))$:\n$$\n\\int_{M_0}^{M(t)} \\frac{1}{M'} dM' = \\int_0^t k \\, dt'\n$$\n$$\n[\\ln|M'|]_{M_0}^{M(t)} = [kt']_0^t\n$$\nSince tumor mass $M$ is non-negative, we can drop the absolute value.\n$$\n\\ln(M(t)) - \\ln(M_0) = k(t - 0)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{M(t)}{M_0}\\right) = kt\n$$\nExponentiating both sides yields the general solution for $M(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{M(t)}{M_0} = \\exp(kt) \\implies M(t) = M_0 \\exp(kt)\n$$\nNow, we must express the rate constant $k$ in terms of the doubling time $T_d$. By definition, at $t=T_d$, the mass is $M(T_d) = 2M_0$. Substituting this into our solution:\n$$\n2M_0 = M_0 \\exp(k T_d)\n$$\nDividing by $M_0$ (which is non-zero):\n$$\n2 = \\exp(k T_d)\n$$\nTo solve for $k$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln(2) = k T_d \\implies k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_d}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $k$ back into the equation for $M(t)$:\n$$\nM(t) = M_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_d} t\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property of exponents $a^{bc} = (a^b)^c$ and that $\\exp(\\ln(x)) = x$, we can rewrite this as:\n$$\nM(t) = M_0 \\left(\\exp(\\ln(2))\\right)^{t/T_d} = M_0 \\cdot 2^{t/T_d}\n$$\nThis is the required form of $M(t)$ in terms of $M_0$, $t$, and $T_d$.\n\n**Part (b): Calculation of the Fold-Increase Factor**\n\nWe are asked to compute the fold-increase factor $F = \\frac{M(t)}{M_0}$ for $T_d = 24$ hours over a period of $t = 5$ days.\nFirst, we must ensure the units of $t$ and $T_d$ are consistent.
