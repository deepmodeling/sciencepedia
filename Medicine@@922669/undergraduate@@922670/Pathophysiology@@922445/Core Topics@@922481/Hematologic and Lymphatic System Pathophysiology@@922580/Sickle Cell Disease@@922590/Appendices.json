Treat hemoglobin as a macromolecule whose net charge arises from the ensemble average of ionizable side chains.

In HbS, each $\\beta$ chain has the glutamate-to-valine substitution, so the tetramer lacks $2$ glutamate carboxylates relative to HbA in total.\n- Near the isoelectric region of HbA, assume the net $\\mathrm{pH}$-dependence of charge is dominated by $N_{\\mathrm{His}}=12$ histidine residues with identical $pK_{a,\\mathrm{His}} = 6.8$, each contributing an average positive charge given by the Henderson–Hasselbalch relation for a basic group: \n  $$\n  q_{\\mathrm{His}}(\\mathrm{pH})=\\frac{1}{1+10^{\\mathrm{pH}-pK_{a,\\mathrm{His}}}}.\n  $$\n  Treat these sites as independent and non-interacting for the purpose of estimating the local slope of net charge versus $\\mathrm{pH}$ near the isoelectric point.\n- Take the isoelectric point of HbA to be $pI_{A}=6.9$.\n\nUsing a first-order (linear) approximation of the net-charge titration curve about $pI_{A}$, estimate the shift in isoelectric point $\\Delta pI = pI_{S}-pI_{A}$ induced by the loss of the two glutamate charges in HbS.

That is, $Q(pI) = 0$.\n\nThe problem describes the mutation in Hemoglobin S (HbS) relative to Hemoglobin A (HbA). In the $\\alpha_{2}\\beta_{2}$ tetramer, two glutamate residues, one on each $\\beta$ chain, are replaced by valine residues. At a near-neutral $\\mathrm{pH}$, the side chain of glutamate (a carboxylic acid with $pK_a \\approx 4.1$) is deprotonated and carries a charge of approximately $-1$. The side chain of valine is a nonpolar alkyl group and is uncharged. Therefore, the net charge difference, $\\Delta Q$, between an HbS molecule and an HbA molecule at the same $\\mathrm{pH}$ is the charge gained from removing two glutamates and adding two valines:\n$$\n\\Delta Q = Q_{S} - Q_{A} = 2 \\times (\\text{charge of valine}) - 2 \\times (\\text{charge of glutamate}) = 2(0) - 2(-1) = +2\n$$\nThis means that at any given $\\mathrm{pH}$ in the neutral range, an HbS molecule is more positive (or less negative) than an HbA molecule by $2$ elementary charge units. The relationship between the charge of the two proteins is:\n$$\nQ_{S}(\\mathrm{pH}) = Q_{A}(\\mathrm{pH}) + 2\n$$\nThe isoelectric point of HbA, $pI_{A}$, is given as $6.9$, so by definition, $Q_{A}(pI_{A}) = Q_{A}(6.9) = 0$. The isoelectric point of HbS, $pI_{S}$, is the $\\mathrm{pH}$ at which $Q_{S}(pI_{S}) = 0$. Using the aformentioned charge relationship, this condition becomes:\n$$\nQ_{A}(pI_{S}) + 2 = 0\n$$\nTo find $pI_{S}$, we need an expression for $Q_{A}(\\mathrm{pH})$ near $pI_{A}$. We use a first-order Taylor expansion (a linear approximation) for $Q_{A}(\\mathrm{pH})$ around $\\mathrm{pH} = pI_{A}$:\n$$\nQ_{A}(\\mathrm{pH}) \\approx Q_{A}(pI_{A}) + \\left. \\frac{dQ_{A}}{d(\\mathrm{pH})} \\right|_{\\mathrm{pH}=pI_{A}} (\\mathrm{pH} - pI_{A})\n$$\nSince $Q_{A}(pI_{A}) = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nQ_{A}(\\mathrm{pH}) \\approx S \\cdot (\\mathrm{pH} - pI_{A})\n$$\nwhere $S = \\left. \\frac{dQ_{A}}{d(\\mathrm{pH})} \\right|_{\\mathrm{pH}=pI_{A}}$ is the slope of the charge titration curve at the isoelectric point of HbA.\n\nThe problem states that this slope is dominated by the titration of $N_{\\mathrm{His}}=12$ histidine residues, each with $pK_{a,\\mathrm{His}} = 6.8$. The average positive charge contributed by one such residue is given by:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{His}}(\\mathrm{pH}) = \\frac{1}{1+10^{\\mathrm{pH}-pK_{a,\\mathrm{His}}}}\n$$\nThe total charge from all $12$ histidines is $Q_{\\mathrm{His}}(\\mathrm{pH}) = N_{\\mathrm{His}} \\cdot q_{\\mathrm{His}}(\\mathrm{pH})$. We approximate the slope $S$ by differentiating this expression with respect to $\\mathrm{pH}$:\n$$\nS \\approx \\frac{d}{d(\\mathrm{pH})} \\left( N_{\\mathrm{His}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1+10^{\\mathrm{pH}-pK_{a,\\mathrm{His}}}} \\right) = N_{\\mathrm{His}} \\cdot \\frac{d}{d(\\mathrm{pH})} \\left( (1+10^{\\mathrm{pH}-pK_{a,\\mathrm{His}}})^{-1} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, where the derivative of $10^u$ with respect to $u$ is $10^u \\ln(10)$:\n$$\nS = N_{\\mathrm{His}} \\cdot \\left[ -1 \\cdot (1+10^{\\mathrm{pH}-pK_{a,\\mathrm{His}}})^{-2} \\cdot \\left( 10^{\\mathrm{pH}-pK_{a,\\mathrm{His}}} \\ln(10) \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nS = -N_{\\mathrm{His}} \\frac{\\ln(10) \\cdot 10^{\\mathrm{pH}-pK_{a,\\mathrm{His}}}}{(1+10^{\\mathrm{pH}-pK_{a,\\mathrm{His}}})^2}\n$$\nWe evaluate this slope at $\\mathrm{pH} = pI_{A} = 6.9$. With $N_{\\mathrm{His}}=12$ and $pK_{a,\\mathrm{His}}=6.8$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} - pK_{a,\\mathrm{His}} = 6.9 - 6.8 = 0.1\n$$\n$$\nS = -12 \\cdot \\frac{\\ln(10) \\cdot 10^{0.1}}{(1+10^{0.1})^2}\n$$\nNumerically, $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.3026$ and $10^{0.1} \\approx 1.2589$.\n$$\nS \\approx -12 \\cdot \\frac{2.3026 \\cdot 1.2589}{(1+1.2589)^2} = -12 \\cdot \\frac{2.8988}{(2.2589)^2} \\approx -12 \\cdot \\frac{2.8988}{5.1027} \\approx -12 \\cdot (0.5681) \\approx -6.817\n$$\nThe sign of the slope is negative, which is expected: as $\\mathrm{pH}$ increases, protons are removed, and the net charge of the protein becomes more negative (or less positive). The magnitude of the slope at $pI_A$ is approximately $6.82$.\n\nNow we can find $pI_{S}$. We substitute the linear approximation of $Q_A$ into the condition for the pI of HbS, $Q_{A}(pI_{S}) + 2 = 0$:\n$$\nS \\cdot (pI_{S} - pI_{A}) + 2 \\approx 0\n$$\nThe shift in the isoelectric point is $\\Delta pI = pI_{S} - pI_{A}$.\n$$\nS \\cdot \\Delta pI \\approx -2\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta pI \\approx -\\frac{2}{S} = -\\frac{2}{-6.817} \\approx 0.29337\n$$\nRounding the final answer to $2$ significant figures gives $\\Delta pI \\approx 0.29$.\n\nThe positive sign of $\\Delta pI$ indicates that the isoelectric point of HbS is higher than that of HbA ($pI_{S} > pI_{A}$). This is consistent with HbS being more positively charged than HbA. To make HbS neutral, one must raise the $\\mathrm{pH}$ to a more alkaline value compared to HbA, to deprotonate additional acidic groups. At an alkaline $\\mathrm{pH}$ used for electrophoresis (e.g., $\\mathrm{pH} > pI_S$), both proteins are net negative. However, since $Q_S = Q_A + 2$, HbS is always less negative than HbA. In an electric field, both will migrate towards the positive electrode (the anode), but HbS, being less negatively charged, will experience a weaker electrostatic force and thus migrate more slowly than HbA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.29}$$", "id": "4450472"}, {"introduction": "The sickling of red blood cells leads to their premature destruction, a condition known as hemolytic anemia, which is a central feature of sickle cell disease.

The analysis will be based on the mass balance principle for a steady-state system.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the given information and principles. The mass balance principle at steady state dictates that the rate of production of a substance within a compartment must equal its rate of destruction or removal to maintain a constant total mass. For the circulating red blood cell (RBC) pool, this can be stated as:\n\n$$\nP = D\n$$\n\nwhere $P$ is the rate of production of hemoglobin (in units of mass per time, e.g., $\\text{g/day}$) and $D$ is the rate of destruction of hemoglobin (in the same units).\n\nThe problem approximates the total RBC mass by the total circulating hemoglobin mass, $M_{Hb}$. This total mass is the product of the hemoglobin concentration, $c_{Hb}$ (in $\\text{g/dL}$), and the total blood volume, $V$ (in $\\text{L}$).
