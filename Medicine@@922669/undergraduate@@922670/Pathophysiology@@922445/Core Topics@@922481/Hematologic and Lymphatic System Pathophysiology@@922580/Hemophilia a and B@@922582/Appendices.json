This is the difference between the target activity, $A_f$, and the baseline activity, $A_0$.\n$$\n\\Delta A = A_f - A_0\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Delta A = 100\\% - 1\\% = 99\\%\n$$\nThis means we need to increase the activity by $99$ percentage points.\n\nNext, we use the given pharmacokinetic relationship to determine the required dose in International Units per kilogram of body weight ($D_{kg}$). The problem states that $1 \\text{ IU/kg}$ of FVIII raises the plasma activity by $2$ percentage points. We can express this response factor as $k = 2\\ \\frac{\\%}{\\text{IU/kg}}$. The required dose per kilogram is therefore the total required activity increase divided by this response factor.\n$$\nD_{kg} = \\frac{\\Delta A}{k}\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nD_{kg} = \\frac{99\\ \\%}{2\\ \\frac{\\%}{\\text{IU/kg}}} = 49.5\\ \\frac{\\text{IU}}{\\text{kg}}\n$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the total dose of FVIII, $D_{total}$, by multiplying the dose per kilogram ($D_{kg}$) by the patient's total body weight, $W$.\n$$\nD_{total} = D_{kg} \\times W\n$$\nUsing the patient's weight, $W = 70\\ \\mathrm{kg}$:\n$$\nD_{total} = 49.5\\ \\frac{\\text{IU}}{\\text{kg}} \\times 70\\ \\mathrm{kg} = 3465\\ \\text{IU}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $3465$. To round this to three significant figures, we look at the fourth digit (which is $5$). Since it is $5$ or greater, we round up the third digit.\n$$\n3465 \\approx 3470\n$$\nIn standard scientific notation, this is expressed as $3.47 \\times 10^3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.47 \\times 10^3}$$", "id": "4379789"}, {"introduction": "While factor deficiency is the defining feature of hemophilia, treatment can be complicated by the development of inhibitors—antibodies that neutralize the replacement factor.

The APTT of the mix has reverted to being nearly as prolonged as the original patient sample. This behavior—initial partial correction followed by a loss of correction over time and with incubation—is the hallmark of a time- and temperature-dependent inhibitor.

The solution will be derived using a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model with first-order elimination.\n\nLet $m$ be the patient's mass, $C_{base}$ be the baseline FVIII plasma activity, and $C_{target}$ be the desired FVIII plasma activity.
