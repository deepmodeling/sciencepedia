The exposure $X$ has a small, consistently positive (harmful) effect within each stratum, contributing a $+0.02$ to the overall risk difference. However, the covariate $S$ acts as a strong confounder. The baseline risk of the outcome increases sharply with the stratum index ($0.01$ in $S=1$, $0.05$ in $S=2$, $0.20$ in $S=3$). The distribution of exposed and unexposed individuals across these strata is severely imbalanced:\n- The exposed group ($X=1$) is predominantly in the lowest-risk stratum ($80\\%$ in $S=1$).\n- The unexposed group ($X=0$) is predominantly in the highest-risk stratum ($70\\%$ in $S=3$).\nThus, the marginal comparison is between a group that is inherently low-risk (the exposed) and a group that is inherently high-risk (the unexposed). This structural difference, captured by the large negative confounding term ($-0.1255$), completely overwhelms the small positive direct effect of the exposure ($+0.02$), leading to the paradoxical negative marginal risk difference of $-0.1055$.

The bounds are uninformative (i.e., the interval is exactly $[0,1]$) only if the negations of both conditions hold: $t \\leq 1-x$ AND $t \\geq x$. This condition, $x \\leq t \\leq 1-x$, can only be satisfied if $x \\leq 1-x$, which implies $2x \\leq 1$ or $x \\leq 0.5$. If $x > 0.5$, the bounds are always informative.\n\nFinally, we apply these results to the hypothetical district with $x = 0.70$ and $t = 0.60$.\nThe lower bound for $p_A$ is:\n$$ p_{A, \\text{lower}} = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{0.60 - 1 + 0.70}{0.70}\\right) = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{0.30}{0.70}\\right) = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{3}{7}\\right) = \\frac{3}{7} $$\nThe upper bound for $p_A$ is:\n$$ p_{A, \\text{upper}} = \\min\\left(1, \\frac{0.60}{0.70}\\right) = \\min\\left(1, \\frac{6}{7}\\right) = \\frac{6}{7} $$\nThe exact interval for $p_A$ is $[\\frac{3}{7}, \\frac{6}{7}]$. To provide the numerical values as requested, we compute the decimal approximations and round to four significant figures.\nLower bound: $\\frac{3}{7} \\approx 0.428571...$, which rounds to $0.4286$.\nUpper bound: $\\frac{6}{7} \\approx 0.857142...$, which rounds to $0.8571$.\nThe numerical bounds for $p_A$ are approximately $[0.4286, 0.8571]$. These bounds are informative, as expected, since $x=0.70 > 0.5$. Specifically, $t=0.60 < x=0.70$ and $t=0.60 > 1-x=0.30$, so both the upper and lower bounds are non-trivial.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.4286 & 0.8571 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4643865"}]}
