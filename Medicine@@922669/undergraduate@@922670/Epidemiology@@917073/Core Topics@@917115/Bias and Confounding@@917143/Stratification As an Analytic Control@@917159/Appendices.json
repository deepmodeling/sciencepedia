Both are less than $1$, indicating a protective association between exposure $A$ and outcome $D$ within each stratum.\nHowever, the crude odds ratio is $OR_{crude} \\approx 5.88$, which is much greater than $1$. This indicates a strong harmful association.\nThe direction of the association is reversed when the data are collapsed and the stratifying variable $C$ is ignored. This phenomenon is an example of Simpson's Paradox, which arises due to confounding.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Mantel–Haenszel pooled odds ratio.**\n\nThe Mantel–Haenszel estimator for the common odds ratio across strata is given by:\n$$OR_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{i} \\frac{a_i d_i}{n_i}}{\\sum_{i} \\frac{b_i c_i}{n_i}}$$\nwhere $n_i$ is the total number of subjects in stratum $i$ ($n_i = a_i + b_i + c_i + d_i$).\n\nFor stratum $C=0$:\n$n_0 = 2 + 48 + 24 + 276 = 350$.\n$\\frac{a_0 d_0}{n_0} = \\frac{2 \\times 276}{350} = \\frac{552}{350}$.\n$\\frac{b_0 c_0}{n_0} = \\frac{48 \\times 24}{350} = \\frac{1152}{350}$.\n\nFor stratum $C=1$:\n$n_1 = 270 + 180 + 35 + 15 = 500$.\n$\\frac{a_1 d_1}{n_1} = \\frac{270 \\times 15}{500} = \\frac{4050}{500}$.\n$\\frac{b_1 c_1}{n_1} = \\frac{180 \\times 35}{500} = \\frac{6300}{500}$.\n\nNow, we compute $OR_{MH}$:\n$$OR_{MH} = \\frac{\\frac{552}{350} + \\frac{4050}{500}}{\\frac{1152}{350} + \\frac{6300}{500}} = \\frac{\\frac{552 \\times 10 + 4050 \\times 7}{3500}}{\\frac{1152 \\times 10 + 6300 \\times 7}{3500}} = \\frac{5520 + 28350}{11520 + 44100} = \\frac{33870}{55620} = \\frac{3387}{5562}$$\n$$OR_{MH} \\approx 0.60898957...$$\nThe Mantel-Haenszel pooled odds ratio provides a summary measure of association, adjusted for the confounding effects of $C$. Its value is consistent with the stratum-specific odds ratios.\n\nRounding to four significant figures, $OR_{MH} \\approx 0.6090$.\n\n**Step 5: Explain the reversal using probabilities of C.**\n\nThe reversal is due to $C$ being a confounder. A confounder is a variable associated with both the exposure ($A$) and the outcome ($D$) that distorts the $A-D$ relationship when it is not controlled for.\n1.  **Association between $C$ and $A$ (Exposure):** We compute the probability of being in the severe stratum ($C=1$) given exposure status.\n    -   Total number of exposed subjects ($A=1$): $(a_0 + b_0) + (a_1 + b_1) = (2+48) + (270+180) = 50 + 450 = 500$.\n    -   Number of exposed subjects in stratum $C=1$: $a_1 + b_1 = 270 + 180 = 450$.\n    -   $P(C=1 \\mid A=1) = \\frac{450}{500} = 0.9$.\n    -   Total number of unexposed subjects ($A=0$): $(c_0 + d_0) + (c_1 + d_1) = (24+276) + (35+15) = 300 + 50 = 350$.\n    -   Number of unexposed subjects in stratum $C=1$: $c_1 + d_1 = 35 + 15 = 50$.\n    -   $P(C=1 \\mid A=0) = \\frac{50}{350} = \\frac{1}{7} \\approx 0.143$.\nThere is a strong association between $C$ and $A$: exposed individuals are far more likely to be in the severe stratum ($90\\%$) than unexposed individuals ($14.3\\%$).\n\n2.  **Association between $C$ and $D$ (Outcome):** Within each level of exposure, the risk of outcome $D$ is much higher in stratum $C=1$.\n    -   Among exposed ($A=1$): The odds of disease are $\\frac{a_1}{b_1} = \\frac{270}{180} = 1.5$ for $C=1$, versus $\\frac{a_0}{b_0} = \\frac{2}{48} \\approx 0.042$ for $C=0$.\n    -   Among unexposed ($A=0$): The odds of disease are $\\frac{c_1}{d_1} = \\frac{35}{15} \\approx 2.33$ for $C=1$, versus $\\frac{c_0}{d_0} = \\frac{24}{276} \\approx 0.087$ for $C=0$.\nIn both cases, individuals in the severe stratum ($C=1$) have a much higher odds of being a case.\n\n**Conclusion on Reversal:** The crude analysis is misleading because it compares a largely severe-stratum exposed group with a largely mild-stratum unexposed group. The high risk of disease in the crude exposed group is primarily driven by the fact that $90\\%$ of them are in the high-risk 'severe' stratum, not by a harmful effect of the exposure itself. Stratification controls for this imbalance, revealing the true, protective nature of the exposure within each stratum. The large difference between $P(C=1 \\mid A=1)$ and $P(C=1 \\mid A=0)$ is the quantitative source of this confounding.\n\nThe final answer required is the Mantel-Haenszel pooled odds ratio, rounded to four significant figures.\n$OR_{MH} = \\frac{3387}{5562} \\approx 0.6090$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.6090}\n$$", "id": "4638397"}, {"introduction": "After using stratification to control for confounding, the next step is to examine the exposure's effect within each subgroup or stratum.

The given probabilities are:\nStratum-specific risks:\n$P(Y=1 \\mid X=0, C=0) = 0.05$\n$P(Y=1 \\mid X=1, C=0) = 0.15$\n$P(Y=1 \\mid X=0, C=1) = 0.20$\n$P(Y=1 \\mid X=1, C=1) = 0.30$\n\nDistribution of the covariate $C$ conditional on exposure $X$:\n$P(C=0 \\mid X=0) = 0.80$\n$P(C=1 \\mid X=0) = 0.20$\n$P(C=0 \\mid X=1) = 0.20$\n$P(C=1 \\mid X=1) = 0.80$\n\n**1. Verification of Stratum-Specific Effect Measures**\n\nWe first compute the risk difference ($RD$) and risk ratio ($RR$) within each stratum of the covariate $C$.\n\nThe risk difference is defined as $RD = P(Y=1 \\mid X=1) - P(Y=1 \\mid X=0)$.\nFor the stratum where $C=0$:\n$$RD_{C=0} = P(Y=1 \\mid X=1, C=0) - P(Y=1 \\mid X=0, C=0) = 0.15 - 0.05 = 0.10$$\nFor the stratum where $C=1$:\n$$RD_{C=1} = P(Y=1 \\mid X=1, C=1) - P(Y=1 \\mid X=0, C=1) = 0.30 - 0.20 = 0.10$$\nSince $RD_{C=0} = RD_{C=1} = 0.10$, the stratum-specific risk differences are constant across the levels of $C$.\n\nThe risk ratio is defined as $RR = P(Y=1 \\mid X=1) / P(Y=1 \\mid X=0)$.\nFor the stratum where $C=0$:\n$$RR_{C=0} = \\frac{P(Y=1 \\mid X=1, C=0)}{P(Y=1 \\mid X=0, C=0)} = \\frac{0.15}{0.05} = 3.0$$\nFor the stratum where $C=1$:\n$$RR_{C=1} = \\frac{P(Y=1 \\mid X=1, C=1)}{P(Y=1 \\mid X=0, C=1)} = \\frac{0.30}{0.20} = 1.5$$\nSince $RR_{C=0} = 3.0$ and $RR_{C=1} = 1.5$, which are not equal, the stratum-specific risk ratios vary across the levels of $C$.\n\n**2. Computation of the Crude (Marginal) Risk Ratio**\n\nTo compute the crude risk ratio, we must first find the marginal risks, $P(Y=1 \\mid X=1)$ and $P(Y=1 \\mid X=0)$, by applying the law of total probability and marginalizing over the covariate $C$.\n\nThe marginal risk among the exposed ($X=1$) is:\n$$P(Y=1 \\mid X=1) = P(Y=1 \\mid X=1, C=0)P(C=0 \\mid X=1) + P(Y=1 \\mid X=1, C=1)P(C=1 \\mid X=1)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(Y=1 \\mid X=1) = (0.15)(0.20) + (0.30)(0.80) = 0.03 + 0.24 = 0.27$$\n\nThe marginal risk among the unexposed ($X=0$) is:\n$$P(Y=1 \\mid X=0) = P(Y=1 \\mid X=0, C=0)P(C=0 \\mid X=0) + P(Y=1 \\mid X=0, C=1)P(C=1 \\mid X=0)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(Y=1 \\mid X=0) = (0.05)(0.80) + (0.20)(0.20) = 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.08$$\n\nThe crude risk ratio, $RR_{\\text{crude}}$, is the ratio of these marginal risks:\n$$RR_{\\text{crude}} = \\frac{P(Y=1 \\mid X=1)}{P(Y=1 \\mid X=0)} = \\frac{0.27}{0.08} = 3.375$$\nRounded to four significant figures, the crude risk ratio is $3.375$.\n\n**3. Explanation of Concepts**\n\nThese results illustrate **scale-dependent interpretation** because the homogeneity of the exposure effect across strata depends on the mathematical scale used for measurement. On the additive scale (risk difference), the effect is constant ($RD = 0.10$ in both strata). On the multiplicative scale (risk ratio), the effect varies ($RR=3.0$ vs. $RR=1.5$). This phenomenon is known as effect measure modification, and its presence or absence can depend on the chosen effect measure.\n\nStratification provides **analytic control for C** by revealing the true nature of the exposure-outcome association within homogeneous subgroups defined by the covariate $C$. In this problem, $C$ meets the criteria for a confounder: it is associated with the exposure ($P(C=1 \\mid X=1) \\neq P(C=1 \\mid X=0)$) and is an independent risk factor for the outcome (e.g., $P(Y=1 \\mid X=0, C=1) \\neq P(Y=1 \\mid X=0, C=0)$). The crude risk ratio of $3.375$ is a weighted average of the stratum-specific risk ratios, but the weighting is distorted by the uneven distribution of $C$ between the exposed and unexposed groups. The crude value is not equal to either of the stratum-specific RRs and lies outside their range. By stratifying, we control for this confounding, allowing for an un-confounded assessment of the effect within each stratum, which reveals the effect modification on the ratio scale.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.375}\n$$", "id": "4638416"}]}
