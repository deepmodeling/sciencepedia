There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It represents a standard exercise in applying the principles of causal inference. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. We may proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe primary objective is to identify a minimal set of covariates for conditioning that satisfies the backdoor criterion to allow for an unbiased estimation of the total causal effect of $X$ on $Y$. Restriction is a form of conditioning implemented at the study design stage.\n\nThe backdoor criterion states that a set of variables $Z$ is sufficient for adjustment if:\n1.  No variable in $Z$ is a descendant of the exposure $X$.\n2.  The variables in $Z$ block every noncausal (backdoor) path between the exposure $X$ and the outcome $Y$. A backdoor path is a path that begins with an arrow pointing into $X$.\n\nLet us systematically identify all paths between $X$ and $Y$ and determine which are backdoor paths requiring blockage.\n\nThe directed paths from $X$ to $Y$ constitute the causal effect. We must not block these.\n-   **Causal Path 1:** $X \\to M \\to Y$. This is a mediated causal path.\n\nThe noncausal paths between $X$ and $Y$ must be identified and blocked. A path is blocked by conditioning on a variable if that variable is a chain ($A \\to B \\to C$) or a fork ($A \\leftarrow B \\to C$) on the path. A path is also blocked if it contains a collider ($A \\to B \\leftarrow C$) that is *not* conditioned upon.\n\n-   **Noncausal Path 1:** $X \\leftarrow C \\to Y$. This is a backdoor path where $C$ is a common cause of $X$ and $Y$. It is a source of confounding. This path is open by default. To block it, we must condition on $C$.\n\n-   **Noncausal Path 2:** $X \\leftarrow L \\to M \\to Y$. This is another backdoor path. It is open by default. To block this path, we can condition on either $L$ (a fork) or $M$ (a chain). However, the variable $M$ is a descendant of $X$ due to the edge $X \\to M$. According to the first rule of the backdoor criterion, $M$ cannot be included in the adjustment set $Z$. Therefore, to block this path, we must condition on $L$.\n\n-   **Noncausal Path 3:** $X \\to S \\leftarrow Y$. This path is not a backdoor path as it does not begin with an arrow into $X$. The variable $S$ is a collider on this path. A path containing an unconditioned collider is naturally blocked. Conditioning on $S$ (or any of its descendants) would open this path and induce collider-stratification bias. Furthermore, since $X \\to S$, $S$ is a descendant of $X$ and is disqualified from the adjustment set by the first rule of the backdoor criterion. Thus, we must *not* condition on $S$.\n\n-   **Role of E:** The variable $E$ is a cause of $X$ ($E \\to X$) but has no other connection to the system. It does not lie on any path between $X$ and $Y$. Therefore, $E$ is not a confounder and does not need to be conditioned on to block any backdoor paths.\n\nBased on this analysis, to satisfy the backdoor criterion, we must block the path $X \\leftarrow C \\to Y$ and the path $X \\leftarrow L \\to M \\to Y$.\n-   To block $X \\leftarrow C \\to Y$, we must condition on $C$.\n-   To block $X \\leftarrow L \\to M \\to Y$, we must condition on $L$.\n\nThe sufficient set for adjustment is thus $\\{C, L\\}$. This set satisfies both conditions of the backdoor criterion:\n1.  Neither $C$ nor $L$ are descendants of $X$.\n2.  Conditioning on $\\{C, L\\}$ blocks all backdoor paths between $X$ and $Y$.\n\nThe question asks for the *minimal* such set.\n-   The set is $\\{C, L\\}$.\n-   If we remove $C$, the path $X \\leftarrow C \\to Y$ becomes unblocked.\n-   If we remove $L$, the path $X \\leftarrow L \\to M \\to Y$ becomes unblocked.\nTherefore, the set $\\{C, L\\}$ is indeed minimal.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. $\\{C, L\\}$**\nThis set involves conditioning on $C$ and $L$. As derived above, conditioning on $C$ blocks the path $X \\leftarrow C \\to Y$, and conditioning on $L$ blocks the path $X \\leftarrow L \\to M \\to Y$. This set blocks all backdoor paths. Neither $C$ nor $L$ is a descendant of $X$. The set is minimal because removing either variable leaves a backdoor path open.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $\\{C, M\\}$**\nThis set is invalid for two reasons. First, the variable $M$ is a descendant of $X$ (due to the path $X \\to M$), which violates the first condition of the backdoor criterion. Conditioning on a descendant of the exposure can introduce bias. Second, $M$ is a mediator on the causal path $X \\to M \\to Y$. Conditioning on a mediator blocks this part of the causal effect, leading to an estimate of the direct effect of $X$ on $Y$, not the total causal effect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $\\{C\\}$**\nThis set is insufficient. While conditioning on $C$ blocks the backdoor path $X \\leftarrow C \\to Y$, it fails to block the backdoor path $X \\leftarrow L \\to M \\to Y$. Thus, confounding due to $L$ would remain.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $\\{L, S\\}$**\nThis set is insufficient and actively harmful. It is insufficient because it does not include $C$, leaving the path $X \\leftarrow C \\to Y$ open. It is harmful because $S$ is a collider on the path $X \\to S \\leftarrow Y$. Conditioning on $S$ opens this noncausal path, inducing collider-stratification bias. Additionally, $S$ is a descendant of $X$, so it cannot be part of a valid backdoor adjustment set.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. $\\{C, L, E\\}$**\nThis set is sufficient because it contains the minimal sufficient set $\\{C, L\\}$. Conditioning on $C$ and $L$ blocks all backdoor paths. Conditioning on the additional variable $E$ is unnecessary, as $E$ is not on any backdoor path between $X$ and $Y$. Since the question asks for the *minimal* set, and $E$ can be removed from this set without compromising its ability to block all backdoor paths, this set is not minimal.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4631027"}, {"introduction": "While restriction can effectively control for the chosen variable, it doesn't always eliminate all confounding.

This constant can be absorbed into the intercept term. Let the new intercept for this subpopulation be $\\beta'_{0} = \\beta_{0} + 50\\,\\beta_{A}$. The true model for $Y$ within this restricted subpopulation is:\n$$Y = \\beta'_{0} + \\beta_{E}\\,E + \\beta_{S}\\,S + \\varepsilon$$\nThe values for the coefficients are given as $\\beta_{E} = 2$ and $\\beta_{S} = 5$.\n\nThe problem states that a simple linear regression model is fitted using only the exposure $E$ as a predictor. This misspecified model is:\n$$Y = \\alpha_{0} + \\alpha_{E}\\,E + \\nu$$\nwhere $\\nu$ is the error term of the misspecified model.\n\nThe ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator for the coefficient $\\alpha_E$, denoted $\\hat{\\alpha}_{E}$, is given by the formula:\n$$\\hat{\\alpha}_{E} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(E, Y)}{\\mathrm{Var}(E)}$$\nwhere the covariance and variance are calculated within the restricted subpopulation ($A=50$).\n\nThe bias of this estimator is the difference between its expected value and the true parameter $\\beta_{E}$. The expected value of the OLS estimator $\\hat{\\alpha}_{E}$ is:\n$$\\mathrm{E}[\\hat{\\alpha}_{E}] = \\mathrm{E}\\left[\\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(E, Y)}{\\mathrm{Var}(E)}\\right]$$\nFor a given population structure, the covariance and variance are fixed quantities, not random variables. Thus, we can write:\n$$\\mathrm{E}[\\hat{\\alpha}_{E}] = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(E, Y)}{\\mathrm{Var}(E)}$$\nWe substitute the true model for $Y$ into the covariance term:\n$$\\mathrm{Cov}(E, Y) = \\mathrm{Cov}(E, \\beta'_{0} + \\beta_{E}\\,E + \\beta_{S}\\,S + \\varepsilon)$$\nUsing the properties of covariance, this expands to:\n$$\\mathrm{Cov}(E, Y) = \\mathrm{Cov}(E, \\beta'_{0}) + \\mathrm{Cov}(E, \\beta_{E}\\,E) + \\mathrm{Cov}(E, \\beta_{S}\\,S) + \\mathrm{Cov}(E, \\varepsilon)$$\nSince $\\beta'_{0}$, $\\beta_{E}$, and $\\beta_{S}$ are constants, and $\\varepsilon$ is independent of $E$:\n$$\\mathrm{Cov}(E, Y) = 0 + \\beta_{E}\\,\\mathrm{Cov}(E, E) + \\beta_{S}\\,\\mathrm{Cov}(E, S) + 0$$\n$$\\mathrm{Cov}(E, Y) = \\beta_{E}\\,\\mathrm{Var}(E) + \\beta_{S}\\,\\mathrm{Cov}(E, S)$$\nNow, we substitute this back into the expression for $\\mathrm{E}[\\hat{\\alpha}_{E}]$:\n$$\\mathrm{E}[\\hat{\\alpha}_{E}] = \\frac{\\beta_{E}\\,\\mathrm{Var}(E) + \\beta_{S}\\,\\mathrm{Cov}(E, S)}{\\mathrm{Var}(E)} = \\beta_{E} + \\beta_{S}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(E, S)}{\\mathrm{Var}(E)}$$\nThe term $\\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(E, S)}{\\mathrm{Var}(E)}$ is the coefficient from a simple linear regression of the omitted variable $S$ on the included variable $E$.\n\nThe confounding bias is defined as the difference between the expected value of the estimated coefficient and the true coefficient:\n$$\\text{Bias} = \\mathrm{E}[\\hat{\\alpha}_{E}] - \\beta_{E} = \\left(\\beta_{E} + \\beta_{S}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(E, S)}{\\mathrm{Var}(E)}\\right) - \\beta_{E} = \\beta_{S}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(E, S)}{\\mathrm{Var}(E)}$$\nThis is the classic formula for omitted variable bias.

Therefore:\n$$\n\\Pr(D=1 \\mid E=1) = \\Pr(D=1)\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\Pr(D=1 \\mid E=0) = \\Pr(D=1)\n$$\nThe problem provides the prevalence of the disease as $\\Pr(D=1) = 0.1$.\nSubstituting this value into the expressions for the conditional probabilities:\n$$\n\\Pr(D=1 \\mid E=1) = 0.1\n$$\n$$\n\\Pr(D=1 \\mid E=0) = 0.1\n$$\nThus, the marginal risk difference is:\n$$\n\\text{RD} = 0.1 - 0.1 = 0\n$$\nThis result confirms that there is no association between exposure and disease in the source population, as expected from the premise of independence.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the Conditional Risk Difference ($\\text{RD}_{H}$)\n\nThe conditional risk difference among the hospitalized individuals is defined as:\n$$\n\\text{RD}_{H} = \\Pr(D=1 \\mid E=1, H=1) - \\Pr(D=1 \\mid E=0, H=1)\n$$\nTo compute these conditional probabilities, we must apply the definition of conditional probability:\n$$\n\\Pr(D=1 \\mid E=1, H=1) = \\frac{\\Pr(D=1, E=1, H=1)}{\\Pr(E=1, H=1)}\n$$\n$$\n\\Pr(D=1 \\mid E=0, H=1) = \\frac{\\Pr(D=1, E=0, H=1)}{\\Pr(E=0, H=1)}\n$$\nThis requires us to calculate several joint and marginal probabilities.\n\nFirst, we calculate the joint probabilities of $E$, $D$, and $H=1$ using the chain rule $\\Pr(A,B,C) = \\Pr(C \\mid A,B)\\Pr(A,B)$ and the provided data:\nThe given joint probabilities for $E$ and $D$ are:\n- $\\Pr(E=1, D=1) = 0.04$\n- $\\Pr(E=1, D=0) = 0.36$\n- $\\Pr(E=0, D=1) = 0.06$\n- $\\Pr(E=0, D=0) = 0.54$\n\nThe given conditional probabilities for hospital admission $H$ are:\n- $\\Pr(H=1 \\mid E=1, D=1) = 0.45$\n- $\\Pr(H=1 \\mid E=1, D=0) = 0.20$\n- $\\Pr(H=1 \\mid E=0, D=1) = 0.30$\n- $\\Pr(H=1 \\mid E=0, D=0) = 0.05$\n\nNow we compute the joint probabilities $\\Pr(E, D, H=1)$:\n$$\n\\Pr(H=1, E=1, D=1) = \\Pr(H=1 \\mid E=1, D=1) \\times \\Pr(E=1, D=1) = 0.45 \\times 0.04 = 0.0180\n$$\n$$\n\\Pr(H=1, E=1, D=0) = \\Pr(H=1 \\mid E=1, D=0) \\times \\Pr(E=1, D=0) = 0.20 \\times 0.36 = 0.0720\n$$\n$$\n\\Pr(H=1, E=0, D=1) = \\Pr(H=1 \\mid E=0, D=1) \\times \\Pr(E=0, D=1) = 0.30 \\times 0.06 = 0.0180\n$$\n$$\n\\Pr(H=1, E=0, D=0) = \\Pr(H=1 \\mid E=0, D=0) \\times \\Pr(E=0, D=0) = 0.05 \\times 0.54 = 0.0270\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the marginal probabilities required for the denominators, $\\Pr(E=1, H=1)$ and $\\Pr(E=0, H=1)$, using the law of total probability by summing over the states of $D$:\n$$\n\\Pr(E=1, H=1) = \\Pr(H=1, E=1, D=1) + \\Pr(H=1, E=1, D=0)\n$$\n$$\n\\Pr(E=1, H=1) = 0.0180 + 0.0720 = 0.0900\n$$\nAnd\n$$\n\\Pr(E=0, H=1) = \\Pr(H=1, E=0, D=1) + \\Pr(H=1, E=0, D=0)\n$$\n$$\n\\Pr(E=0, H=1) = 0.0180 + 0.0270 = 0.0450\n$$\n\nNow we can compute the conditional probabilities for $\\text{RD}_{H}$:\n$$\n\\Pr(D=1 \\mid E=1, H=1) = \\frac{\\Pr(D=1, E=1, H=1)}{\\Pr(E=1, H=1)} = \\frac{0.0180}{0.0900} = \\frac{18}{90} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2\n$$\nNote that $\\Pr(D=1, E=1, H=1)$ is the same event as $\\Pr(H=1, E=1, D=1)$.\nAnd\n$$\n\\Pr(D=1 \\mid E=0, H=1) = \\frac{\\Pr(D=1, E=0, H=1)}{\\Pr(E=0, H=1)} = \\frac{0.0180}{0.0450} = \\frac{18}{45} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4\n$$\nNote that $\\Pr(D=1, E=0, H=1)$ is the same event as $\\Pr(H=1, E=0, D=1)$.\n\nFinally, we compute $\\text{RD}_{H}$:\n$$\n\\text{RD}_{H} = 0.2 - 0.4 = -0.2\n$$\nThis non-zero result demonstrates the spurious association between $E$ and $D$ created by conditioning on the collider $H$.\n\nPart 3: Calculation of the Bias ($B$)\n\nThe bias is the difference between the conditional and marginal risk differences:\n$$\nB = \\text{RD}_{H} - \\text{RD} = -0.2 - 0 = -0.2\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nB = -0.2000\n$$\nThis bias is an example of collider-stratification bias, where restricting the analysis to a specific stratum of a variable that is a common effect of both exposure and outcome induces a non-causal association.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.2000}$$", "id": "4631086"}]}
