It presents a standard, solvable problem in quantitative epidemiology. The problem is deemed **valid**. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to find the true odds ratio, $OR_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{ad}{bc}$, where $a, b, c, d$ represent the cell counts for the true exposure status $X$.\n- $a$: True number of exposed cases ($X=1, D=1$)\n- $b$: True number of exposed controls ($X=1, D=0$)\n- $c$: True number of unexposed cases ($X=0, D=1$)\n- $d$: True number of unexposed controls ($X=0, D=0$)\n\nWe must compute these true counts from the observed counts ($a', b', c', d'$) and the misclassification parameters. The analysis is performed separately for the case and control strata due to the differential nature of the misclassification.\n\n**Analysis for Cases ($D=1$)**\nThe total number of cases is $N_1 = a' + c' = 200 + 100 = 300$. This total is invariant under misclassification, so $a+c = N_1 = 300$.\nThe number of observed exposed cases, $a'$, is the sum of correctly identified true exposed cases and incorrectly identified true unexposed cases:\n$$a' = a \\cdot P(X^{\\ast}=1|X=1, D=1) + c \\cdot P(X^{\\ast}=1|X=0, D=1)$$\nUsing the definitions of sensitivity ($Se_1 = P(X^{\\ast}=1|X=1, D=1)$) and specificity ($Sp_1 = P(X^{\\ast}=0|X=0, D=1)$), this becomes:\n$$a' = a \\cdot Se_1 + c \\cdot (1 - Sp_1)$$\nWe have a system of two linear equations for $a$ and $c$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\na \\cdot Se_1 + c \\cdot (1 - Sp_1) = a' \\\\\na + c = N_1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSubstituting $c = N_1 - a$ into the first equation:\n$$a \\cdot Se_1 + (N_1 - a) \\cdot (1 - Sp_1) = a'$$\n$$a \\cdot Se_1 + N_1(1-Sp_1) - a(1-Sp_1) = a'$$\n$$a \\cdot (Se_1 - 1 + Sp_1) = a' - N_1(1-Sp_1)$$\n$$a = \\frac{a' - N_1(1 - Sp_1)}{Se_1 + Sp_1 - 1}$$\nSubstituting the given values for the case stratum:\n$a' = 200$, $N_1 = 300$, $Se_1 = 0.9$, $Sp_1 = 0.95$.\n$$a = \\frac{200 - 300(1 - 0.95)}{0.9 + 0.95 - 1} = \\frac{200 - 300(0.05)}{0.85} = \\frac{200 - 15}{0.85} = \\frac{185}{0.85} = \\frac{18500}{85} = \\frac{3700}{17}$$\nThe true number of unexposed cases is:\n$$c = N_1 - a = 300 - \\frac{3700}{17} = \\frac{5100 - 3700}{17} = \\frac{1400}{17}$$\n\n**Analysis for Controls ($D=0$)**\nThe total number of controls is $N_0 = b' + d' = 100 + 100 = 200$.

The goal is clearly defined. The existence and uniqueness of the adjusted counts depend on the condition $Se + Sp \\neq 1$, which prevents the classification matrix from being singular. For the given ranges, $Se_1+Sp_1$ ranges from $0.7+0.95=1.65$ to $0.95+0.95=1.9$, and $Se_0+Sp_0$ ranges from $0.7+0.95=1.65$ to $0.95+0.95=1.9$. In all cases, $Se+Sp-1 \\neq 0$, so the true counts are uniquely determinable.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and mathematical terms, free from ambiguity or subjective content.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, mathematically well-posed, and objective. It is deemed **valid**. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nLet $A$, $C$ be the true counts of exposed and unexposed subjects among cases, respectively. Let $B$, $D$ be the true counts of exposed and unexposed subjects among controls, respectively.\nThe total number of cases is $N_1 = a_{obs} + c_{obs} = 200 + 300 = 500$.\nThe total number of controls is $N_0 = b_{obs} + d_{obs} = 125 + 375 = 500$.\nThe total counts are invariant to misclassification, so $N_1 = A+C$ and $N_0 = B+D$.\n\nThe observed counts are functions of the true counts and the misclassification parameters.\nFor the cases (disease=1):\nThe number of observed exposed cases, $a_{obs}$, is the sum of truly exposed cases correctly classified and truly unexposed cases incorrectly classified:\n$$a_{obs} = A \\cdot Se_1 + C \\cdot (1 - Sp_1)$$\nThe number of observed unexposed cases, $c_{obs}$, is the sum of truly exposed cases incorrectly classified and truly unexposed cases correctly classified:\n$$c_{obs} = A \\cdot (1 - Se_1) + C \\cdot Sp_1$$\n\nWe have a system of two linear equations for $A$ and $C$. Substituting $C = N_1 - A$ into the first equation:\n$a_{obs} = A \\cdot Se_1 + (N_1 - A)(1 - Sp_1) = A \\cdot Se_1 + N_1(1-Sp_1) - A(1-Sp_1)$\n$a_{obs} - N_1(1 - Sp_1) = A(Se_1 - 1 + Sp_1)$\nThis gives the corrected count $A$:\n$$A = \\frac{a_{obs} - N_1(1 - Sp_1)}{Se_1 + Sp_1 - 1}$$\nFor the corrected count $C$, we can similarly substitute $A = N_1 - C$ into the second equation or use $C=N_1-A$. Using a symmetric derivation for $C_i$:\n$c_{obs} = (N_1 - C)(1-Se_1) + C \\cdot Sp_1= N_1(1-Se_1) - C(1-Se_1) + C \\cdot Sp_1$\n$c_{obs} - N_1(1-Se_1) = C(Sp_1 - 1 + Se_1)$\n$$C = \\frac{c_{obs} - N_1(1 - Se_1)}{Se_1 + Sp_1 - 1}$$\n\nBy exact analogy for the controls (disease=0), we replace subscript $1$ with $0$, $a_{obs}$ with $b_{obs}$, $c_{obs}$ with $d_{obs}$, and $N_1$ with $N_0$. The corrected counts $B$ and $D$ are:\n$$B = \\frac{b_{obs} - N_0(1 - Sp_0)}{Se_0 + Sp_0 - 1}$$\n$$D = \\frac{d_{obs} - N_0(1 - Se_0)}{Se_0 + Sp_0 - 1}$$\n\nThe adjusted odds ratio, $OR_{\\text{adj}}$, is the odds ratio based on the true counts:\n$$OR_{\\text{adj}} = \\frac{A/C}{B/D} = \\frac{AD}{BC}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $A, B, C, D$:\n$$OR_{\\text{adj}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{a_{obs} - N_1(1 - Sp_1)}{Se_1 + Sp_1 - 1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{d_{obs} - N_0(1 - Se_0)}{Se_0 + Sp_0 - 1}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{b_{obs} - N_0(1 - Sp_0)}{Se_0 + Sp_0 - 1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{c_{obs} - N_1(1 - Se_1)}{Se_1 + Sp_1 - 1}\\right)}$$\nThe denominators $(Se_1 + Sp_1 - 1)$ and $(Se_0 + Sp_0 - 1)$ cancel out, yielding the general formula for the adjusted odds ratio:\n$$OR_{\\text{adj}} = \\frac{\\left( a_{obs} - N_1(1 - Sp_1) \\right) \\left( d_{obs} - N_0(1 - Se_0) \\right)}{\\left( b_{obs} - N_0(1 - Sp_0) \\right) \\left( c_{obs} - N_1(1 - Se_1) \\right)}$$\n\nNow, we perform the sensitivity analysis by substituting the given numerical values and parameter ranges.\nGiven data: $a_{obs}=200$, $c_{obs}=300$, $N_1=500$; $b_{obs}=125$, $d_{obs}=375$, $N_0=500$.\nGiven parameters: $Sp_1=0.95$, $Sp_0=0.95$, $Se_1 \\in [0.7, 0.95]$, $Se_0 \\in [0.7, 0.95]$.\n\nLet's compute the four terms in the $OR_{\\text{adj}}$ expression:\n-   $a_{obs} - N_1(1 - Sp_1) = 200 - 500(1 - 0.95) = 200 - 500(0.05) = 200 - 25 = 175$.\n-   $d_{obs} - N_0(1 - Se_0) = 375 - 500(1 - Se_0) = 375 - 500 + 500 Se_0 = 500 Se_0 - 125$.\n-   $b_{obs} - N_0(1 - Sp_0) = 125 - 500(1 - 0.95) = 125 - 500(0.05) = 125 - 25 = 100$.\n-   $c_{obs} - N_1(1 - Se_1) = 300 - 500(1 - Se_1) = 300 - 500 + 500 Se_1 = 500 Se_1 - 200$.\n\nSubstituting these into the $OR_{\\text{adj}}$ formula:\n$$OR_{\\text{adj}}(Se_1, Se_0) = \\frac{175 \\cdot (500 Se_0 - 125)}{100 \\cdot (500 Se_1 - 200)}$$\nWe can simplify this expression:\n$$OR_{\\text{adj}}(Se_1, Se_0) = \\frac{175}{100} \\cdot \\frac{500(Se_0 - 125/500)}{500(Se_1 - 200/500)}$$\n$$OR_{\\text{adj}}(Se_1, Se_0) = \\frac{7}{4} \\cdot \\frac{Se_0 - 0.25}{Se_1 - 0.4}$$\nWe need to find the minimum and maximum of this function for $Se_1 \\in [0.7, 0.95]$ and $Se_0 \\in [0.7, 0.95]$.\n\nLet's analyze the behavior of $OR_{\\text{adj}}(Se_1, Se_0)$.\nThe partial derivative with respect to $Se_1$ is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial OR_{\\text{adj}}}{\\partial Se_1} = \\frac{7}{4} (Se_0 - 0.25) \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (Se_1 - 0.4)^{-2} = -\\frac{7}{4} \\frac{Se_0 - 0.25}{(Se_1 - 0.4)^2}$$\nIn the domain $Se_0 \\in [0.7, 0.95]$, the term $(Se_0 - 0.25)$ is always positive. The denominator is a square and thus positive. Therefore, $\\frac{\\partial OR_{\\text{adj}}}{\\partial Se_1}  0$, which means $OR_{\\text{adj}}$ is a strictly decreasing function of $Se_1$.\n\nThe partial derivative with respect to $Se_0$ is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial OR_{\\text{adj}}}{\\partial Se_0} = \\frac{7}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{Se_1 - 0.4}$$\nIn the domain $Se_1 \\in [0.7, 0.95]$, the term $(Se_1 - 0.4)$ is always positive. Therefore, $\\frac{\\partial OR_{\\text{adj}}}{\\partial Se_0}  0$, which means $OR_{\\text{adj}}$ is a strictly increasing function of $Se_0$.\n\nSince the function is monotonic with respect to both variables over a rectangular domain, the extrema will occur at the corners of this domain.\n\nTo find the minimum value of $OR_{\\text{adj}}$, we must:\n1. Maximize the denominator, which means maximizing $Se_1$. Let $Se_1 = 0.95$.\n2. Minimize the numerator, which means minimizing $Se_0$. Let $Se_0 = 0.7$.\n$$OR_{\\text{adj, min}} = \\frac{7}{4} \\cdot \\frac{0.7 - 0.25}{0.95 - 0.4} = \\frac{7}{4} \\cdot \\frac{0.45}{0.55} = \\frac{7}{4} \\cdot \\frac{45/100}{55/100} = \\frac{7}{4} \\cdot \\frac{45}{55}_= \\frac{7}{4} \\cdot \\frac{9}{11} = \\frac{63}{44}$$\n\nTo find the maximum value of $OR_{\\text{adj}}$, we must:\n1.
