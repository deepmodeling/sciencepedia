Detection is strongly influenced by clinical outcome severity, because patients with more severe illness are more likely to seek care and be tested. Consider three mutually exclusive severity strata for clinically defined cases: mild, moderate, and severe.

The concepts of case fatality risk, stratification by severity, and differential detection probabilities are standard in infectious disease epidemiology. The problem is well-posed; it provides clear definitions, all necessary parameters for the derivations, and a complete set of numerical values for the calculation. It is objective and uses precise, unambiguous terminology. The sum of the proportions $\\pi_s$ is $0.65 + 0.25 + 0.10 = 1$, confirming internal consistency. The parameter values are plausible for a respiratory pathogen where severity increases both the probability of death and the probability of detection. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of True CFR ($C$)\nThe true case fatality risk, $C$, is the marginal probability of death given a case. By the law of total probability, we can express $C$ by summing over the mutually exclusive severity strata $s \\in \\{\\text{mild}, \\text{moderate}, \\text{severe}\\}$:\n$$C = \\Pr(\\text{death} \\mid \\text{case}) = \\sum_{s} \\Pr(\\text{death} \\mid \\text{case in stratum } s) \\Pr(\\text{case in stratum } s \\mid \\text{case})$$\nFrom the problem's definitions, $\\Pr(\\text{death} \\mid \\text{case in stratum } s) = f_s$ and the proportion of cases in stratum $s$, $\\Pr(\\text{case in stratum } s \\mid \\text{case})$, is $\\pi_s$. Therefore, the true CFR is the weighted average of the stratum-specific fatality probabilities, with the weights being the true proportions of cases in each stratum:\n$$C = \\sum_{s} f_{s} \\pi_{s}$$\n\n### Derivation of Surveillance-Based CFR ($C^{\\text{obs}}$)\nThe surveillance-based CFR estimator in expectation, $C^{\\text{obs}}$, is the probability of death conditional on being a detected case:\n$$C^{\\text{obs}} = \\Pr(\\text{death} \\mid \\text{detected})$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, this can be written as:\n$$C^{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{\\Pr(\\text{death} \\cap \\text{detected})}{\\Pr(\\text{detected})}$$\nWe expand both the numerator and the denominator using the law of total probability, summing over the severity strata. The total probability of a case being detected is:\n$$\\Pr(\\text{detected}) = \\sum_{s} \\Pr(\\text{detected} \\mid \\text{case in stratum } s) \\Pr(\\text{case in stratum } s) = \\sum_{s} p_{s} \\pi_{s}$$\nThe probability of a case being both detected and resulting in death is:\n$$\\Pr(\\text{death} \\cap \\text{detected}) = \\sum_{s} \\Pr(\\text{death} \\cap \\text{detected} \\mid \\text{case in stratum } s) \\Pr(\\text{case in stratum } s)$$\nA key, standard assumption is that within a given severity stratum $s$, the outcome (death) and the detection process are conditionally independent. That is, $\\Pr(\\text{death} \\cap \\text{detected} \\mid \\text{case in stratum } s) = \\Pr(\\text{death} \\mid \\text{case in stratum } s) \\Pr(\\text{detected} \\mid \\text{case in stratum } s) = f_s p_s$. Thus, the numerator becomes:\n$$\\Pr(\\text{death} \\cap \\text{detected}) = \\sum_{s} f_{s} p_{s} \\pi_{s}$$\nCombining these results, the expression for the expected surveillance-based CFR is:\n$$C^{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{\\sum_{s} f_{s} p_{s} \\pi_{s}}{\\sum_{s} p_{s} \\pi_{s}}$$\n\n### Derivation of Bias ($B$)\nThe bias $B$ is defined as the difference between the observed and true CFR:\n$$B = C^{\\text{obs}} - C = \\frac{\\sum_{s} f_{s} p_{s} \\pi_{s}}{\\sum_{s} p_{s} \\pi_{s}} - \\sum_{s} f_{s} \\pi_{s}$$\nThis bias arises because $C^{\\text{obs}}$ is a weighted average of the stratum-specific fatality risks $f_s$, but the weights are $\\frac{p_s \\pi_s}{\\sum_k p_k \\pi_k}$, which are the proportions of detected cases in each stratum, not the true proportions $\\pi_s$. Since detection probability $p_s$ is positively correlated with fatality risk $f_s$, strata with higher fatality are over-represented in the surveillance data, leading to an overestimation of the true CFR ($B>0$).\n\n### Proposed Adjusted Estimator\nTo correct for this bias, we can propose a severity-weighted estimator based on inverse detection probabilities. The principle is to up-weight observations from strata with low detection probabilities to reconstruct the true population proportions.\nLet $N$ be the total number of incident cases. The number of detected cases in stratum $s$ is $N_s^{\\text{det}}$, and the number of detected deaths in stratum $s$ is $D_s^{\\text{det}}$.\nIn expectation, $E[N_s^{\\text{det}}] = N \\pi_s p_s$ and $E[D_s^{\\text{det}}] = N \\pi_s f_s p_s$.\nThe proposed adjusted estimator, $C^{\\text{adj}}$, is the ratio of the total number of deaths estimated by inverse probability weighting to the total number of cases estimated similarly:\n$$C^{\\text{adj}} = \\frac{\\sum_{s} (D_s^{\\text{det}} / p_s)}{\\sum_{s} (N_s^{\\text{det}} / p_s)}$$\nTo show that this estimator recovers the true CFR in expectation, we examine the ratio of the expected values of the numerator and denominator (a standard approach for such ratio estimators, implying asymptotic unbiasedness):\n$$E[C^{\\text{adj}}] \\approx \\frac{E[\\sum_{s} (D_s^{\\text{det}} / p_s)]}{E[\\sum_{s} (N_s^{\\text{det}} / p_s)]} = \\frac{\\sum_{s} (1/p_s) E[D_s^{\\text{det}}]}{\\sum_{s} (1/p_s) E[N_s^{\\text{det}}]}$$\nSubstituting the expected values:\n$$E[C^{\\text{adj}}] \\approx \\frac{\\sum_{s} (1/p_s) (N \\pi_s f_s p_s)}{\\sum_{s} (1/p_s) (N \\pi_s p_s)} = \\frac{\\sum_{s} N \\pi_s f_s}{\\sum_{s} N \\pi_s}$$\nFactoring out $N$:\n$$E[C^{\\text{adj}}] \\approx \\frac{N \\sum_{s} f_s \\pi_s}{N \\sum_{s} \\pi_s}$$\nGiven that $\\sum_{s} \\pi_s = 1$ and $\\sum_{s} f_s \\pi_s = C$, this simplifies to:\n$$E[C^{\\text{adj}}] \\approx \\frac{N C}{N} = C$$\nThus, under correct specification of the stratum-specific detection probabilities $p_s$, the inverse probability-weighted estimator is an unbiased estimator of the true CFR, $C$.\n\n### Numerical Calculation of Bias\nUsing the provided parameter values:\n-   $\\pi_{\\text{mild}} = 0.65$, $\\pi_{\\text{moderate}} = 0.25$, $\\pi_{\\text{severe}} = 0.10$.\n-   $f_{\\text{mild}} = 0.002$, $f_{\\text{moderate}} = 0.015$, $f_{\\text{severe}} = 0.20$.\n-   $p_{\\text{mild}} = 0.30$, $p_{\\text{moderate}} = 0.70$, $p_{\\text{severe}} = 0.95$.\n\nFirst, calculate the true CFR, $C$:\n$$C = f_{\\text{mild}}\\pi_{\\text{mild}} + f_{\\text{moderate}}\\pi_{\\text{moderate}} + f_{\\text{severe}}\\pi_{\\text{severe}}$$\n$$C = (0.002)(0.65) + (0.015)(0.25) + (0.20)(0.10)$$\n$$C = 0.0013 + 0.00375 + 0.02 = 0.02505$$\n\nNext, calculate the expected observed CFR, $C^{\\text{obs}}$:\n$$C^{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{\\sum_{s} f_{s} p_{s} \\pi_{s}}{\\sum_{s} p_{s} \\pi_{s}}$$\nNumerator:\n$$ \\sum_{s} f_{s} p_{s} \\pi_{s} = (0.002)(0.30)(0.65) + (0.015)(0.70)(0.25) + (0.20)(0.95)(0.10) $$\n$$ \\sum_{s} f_{s} p_{s} \\pi_{s} = 0.00039 + 0.002625 + 0.019 = 0.022015 $$\nDenominator:\n$$ \\sum_{s} p_{s} \\pi_{s} = (0.30)(0.65) + (0.70)(0.25) + (0.95)(0.10) $$\n$$ \\sum_{s} p_{s} \\pi_{s} = 0.195 + 0.175 + 0.095 = 0.465 $$\nSo,\n$$C^{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{0.022015}{0.465} \\approx 0.047344086$$\n\nFinally, calculate the bias, $B$:\n$$B = C^{\\text{obs}} - C$$\n$$B \\approx 0.047344086 - 0.02505 = 0.022294086$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the bias is $0.02229$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.02229}$$", "id": "4630095"}, {"introduction": "A persistent challenge in surveillance is estimating the total size of an affected population, including those individuals who were never detected.

It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, ill-posed, or trivial.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Unbiased Estimator\n\nThe problem requires deriving an estimator for the total number of cases, $N$, using the counts from two independent lists. The counts are $n_1$ (cases on list 1), $n_2$ (cases on list 2), and $m$ (cases on both lists).\n\nThe standard naive estimator, known as the Lincoln-Petersen estimator, is derived by equating the proportion of cases from list 1 that are also on list 2 ($m/n_1$) with the proportion of total cases that are on list 2 ($n_2/N$). This yields $\\hat{N}_{LP} = \\frac{n_1 n_2}{m}$. However, this estimator is a maximum likelihood estimator that is known to be biased in small samples and is undefined if $m=0$. To correct for this bias, we use a modified estimator, known as the Chapman estimator.\n\nThe derivation starts, as requested, from the hypergeometric sampling model for the overlap count $m$. Given the total population of cases $N$, of which $n_1$ are on the first list, we consider the second list as a \"sample\" of size $n_2$ drawn from this population. The number of cases in this sample that are also on the first list, $m$, follows a hypergeometric distribution. The probability mass function for $m$, conditional on $N$, $n_1$, and $n_2$, is:\n$$ \\Pr(m \\mid N, n_1, n_2) = \\frac{\\binom{n_1}{m} \\binom{N-n_1}{n_2-m}}{\\binom{N}{n_2}} $$\nThe range of possible values for $m$ is $\\max(0, n_1+n_2-N) \\le m \\le \\min(n_1, n_2)$.\n\nThe proposed bias-corrected estimator is the Chapman estimator:\n$$ \\hat{N} = \\frac{(n_1+1)(n_2+1)}{m+1} - 1 $$\nTo demonstrate that this estimator is unbiased, we must show that its expected value, $E[\\hat{N}]$, is equal to $N$.\n$$ E[\\hat{N}] = E\\left[ \\frac{(n_1+1)(n_2+1)}{m+1} - 1 \\right] = (n_1+1)(n_2+1) E\\left[ \\frac{1}{m+1} \\right] - 1 $$\nThe expectation is taken over the distribution of $m$. We proceed by calculating $E\\left[\\frac{1}{m+1}\\right]$.\n$$ E\\left[\\frac{1}{m+1}\\right] = \\sum_{m} \\frac{1}{m+1} \\Pr(m \\mid N, n_1, n_2) = \\sum_{m} \\frac{1}{m+1} \\frac{\\binom{n_1}{m} \\binom{N-n_1}{n_2-m}}{\\binom{N}{n_2}} $$\nWe use the combinatorial identity $\\frac{1}{k+1}\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{1}{n+1}\\binom{n+1}{k+1}$. Applying this with $n=n_1$ and $k=m$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{m+1}\\binom{n_1}{m} = \\frac{1}{n_1+1}\\binom{n_1+1}{m+1} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the expectation:\n$$ E\\left[\\frac{1}{m+1}\\right] = \\frac{1}{\\binom{N}{n_2}} \\sum_m \\frac{1}{n_1+1} \\binom{n_1+1}{m+1} \\binom{N-n_1}{n_2-m} $$\nFactoring out the constant term:\n$$ E\\left[\\frac{1}{m+1}\\right] = \\frac{1}{(n_1+1)\\binom{N}{n_2}} \\sum_m \\binom{n_1+1}{m+1} \\binom{N-n_1}{n_2-m} $$\nThe summation term can be simplified using Vandermonde's Identity, which states $\\sum_k \\binom{r}{k}\\binom{s}{n-k} = \\binom{r+s}{n}$. Let $k=m+1$. The sum becomes:\n$$ \\sum_{k} \\binom{n_1+1}{k} \\binom{N-n_1}{n_2-(k-1)} = \\sum_{k} \\binom{n_1+1}{k} \\binom{N-n_1}{(n_2+1)-k} $$\nThis matches the form of Vandermonde's Identity with $r=n_1+1$, $s=N-n_1$, and the total number of items to choose being $n_2+1$. Thus, the sum evaluates to:\n$$ \\binom{(n_1+1)+(N-n_1)}{n_2+1} = \\binom{N+1}{n_2+1} $$\nNow we substitute this result back into the expression for $E\\left[\\frac{1}{m+1}\\right]$:\n$$ E\\left[\\frac{1}{m+1}\\right] = \\frac{1}{(n_1+1)\\binom{N}{n_2}} \\binom{N+1}{n_2+1} $$\nNext, we expand the ratio of the binomial coefficients:\n$$ \\frac{\\binom{N+1}{n_2+1}}{\\binom{N}{n_2}} = \\frac{(N+1)!}{(n_2+1)!(N-n_2)!} \\cdot \\frac{n_2!(N-n_2)!}{N!} = \\frac{N+1}{n_2+1} $$\nSubstituting this simplified ratio back gives:\n$$ E\\left[\\frac{1}{m+1}\\right] = \\frac{1}{n_1+1} \\cdot \\frac{N+1}{n_2+1} $$\nThis is a key intermediate result. Now we return to the expectation of the estimator $\\hat{N}$:\n$$ E[\\hat{N}] = (n_1+1)(n_2+1) E\\left[ \\frac{1}{m+1} \\right] - 1 $$\n$$ E[\\hat{N}] = (n_1+1)(n_2+1) \\left( \\frac{1}{n_1+1} \\cdot \\frac{N+1}{n_2+1} \\right) - 1 $$\n$$ E[\\hat{N}] = (N+1) - 1 = N $$\nThis demonstrates that the Chapman estimator $\\hat{N} = \\frac{(n_1+1)(n_2+1)}{m+1} - 1$ is an unbiased estimator for $N$. It should be noted that this result is exactly unbiased provided that $n_1 + n_2 \\ge N$, which ensures that the summation for the expectation covers the full support required by the identity. If this condition is not met, a small bias remains, but the estimator is still substantially less biased than the naive Lincoln-Petersen estimator, especially for small sample sizes.\n\n### Qualitative Analysis of Violated Independence\n\nThe derivation above critically relies on the assumption that the two surveillance lists are independent. The structure of the estimator, $\\hat{N} \\approx \\frac{n_1 n_2}{m}$, shows that the estimate of the total population size is inversely proportional to the observed overlap $m$. Violation of the independence assumption systematically alters $m$, leading to a biased estimate of $N$.\n\n1.  **Positive Dependence (Reporting Bias Synergy)**\n    -   **Condition**: Positive dependence implies that a case captured by one surveillance system is *more* likely to be captured by the second system than would be expected by chance alone. Mathematically, $\\Pr(L_2=1 \\mid L_1=1) > \\Pr(L_2=1)$. This often occurs when both systems draw from a similar pool of sources, for example, if both hospital reporting and laboratory testing are triggered by a severe case presentation requiring hospitalization.\n    -   **Effect on Overlap ($m$)**: For given list sizes $n_1$ and $n_2$, positive dependence will lead to a larger number of cases appearing on both lists. Therefore, the observed overlap count, $m$, will be artificially inflated compared to the count expected under independence.\n    -   **Effect on Estimator ($\\hat{N}$)**: Since the estimator $\\hat{N}$ is inversely proportional to $m$ (or $m+1$), an inflated value of $m$ in the denominator of the expression $\\frac{(n_1+1)(n_2+1)}{m+1}$ will result in a smaller estimate. Consequently, positive dependence leads to an **underestimation** of the true population size $N$. The population will appear smaller than it is because the two lists are less independent than assumed.\n\n2.  **Negative Dependence (Reporting Bias Antagonism)**\n    -   **Condition**: Negative dependence implies that a case captured by one system is *less* likely to be captured by the other. Mathematically, $\\Pr(L_2=1 \\mid L_1=1) < \\Pr(L_2=1)$. This situation is less common but can arise if the two surveillance systems target mutually exclusive subpopulations, for example, if one list captures cases from public health clinics and the other from private specialized hospitals with little patient crossover.\n    -   **Effect on Overlap ($m$)**: For given list sizes $n_1$ and $n_2$, a negative correlation between captures will result in fewer cases appearing on both lists. The observed overlap count, $m$, will be artificially deflated.\n    -   **Effect on Estimator ($\\hat{N}$)**: A deflated value of $m$ in the denominator leads to a larger overall estimate. Therefore, negative dependence leads to an **overestimation** of the true population size $N$. The population will appear larger than it is because the two lists overlap much less than they would by chance.\n\nIn summary, the direction of the bias in $\\hat{N}$ is opposite to the direction of the deviation of the overlap count $m$ from its expected value under independence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{(n_{1} + 1)(n_{2} + 1)}{m + 1} - 1}$$", "id": "4630142"}, {"introduction": "To truly understand the scope of an epidemic, we must quantify the completeness of our surveillance efforts.

Assume the serological assay is perfect for this exercise, so the seroprevalence directly estimates the cumulative incidence.\n\nUse the following foundational facts as your starting point:\n- The cumulative reported count over the period is $C = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} Y_t$.\n- The cumulative incidence is estimated by the sample proportion $\\widehat{\\Pi} = x/m$ from a simple random sample, with approximate variance $\\mathrm{Var}(\\widehat{\\Pi}) \\approx \\Pi (1 - \\Pi)/m$ when the sampling fraction is small.\n- For surveillance counts that are conditionally independent and well-approximated by Poisson distributions, $\\mathrm{Var}(Y_t) \\approx \\mathbb{E}[Y_t]$, and hence $\\mathrm{Var}(C) \\approx \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\mathbb{E}[Y_t]$, which can be estimated by $\\sum_{t=1}^{T} Y_t$.\n- The serosurvey and routine surveillance are independent data sources.\n- The average reporting probability $\\bar{p}$ over the period is defined so that the expected reported cases equal $\\bar{p}$ times the total infections over the period, which equals $N \\Pi$.\n\nTasks:\n1) Derive a consistent point estimator $\\widehat{\\bar{p}}$ of the average reporting probability $\\bar{p}$ using the observed data and the definitions above, and compute its numerical value.\n2) Using the delta method, derive and compute the approximate standard error $\\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\widehat{\\bar{p}})$ by treating $\\widehat{\\bar{p}}$ as a smooth function of the random quantities $C$ and $\\widehat{\\Pi}$, and by using the variance approximations for $C$ and $\\widehat{\\Pi}$ stated above.\n\nAssume independence between $C$ and $\\widehat{\\Pi}$, and express all probabilities as decimals (not percentages). Report your answers as follows: provide the pair $\\left(\\widehat{\\bar{p}}, \\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\widehat{\\bar{p}})\\right)$, in that order. Round both numbers to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the estimation of the average reporting probability, $\\bar{p}$, and its standard error, based on routine surveillance case counts and a cross-sectional serosurvey. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and provides all necessary data and definitions for a unique solution.\n\nFirst, we calculate the preliminary quantities from the provided data.\nThe total population is $N = 800{,}000$.\nThe surveillance period is $T = 8$ weeks.\nThe cumulative reported case count, $C$, is the sum of the weekly counts $Y_t$:\n$$C = \\sum_{t=1}^{8} Y_t = 1200 + 1500 + 1800 + 1600 + 1700 + 1400 + 1300 + 1500 = 12{,}000$$\nThe serosurvey was conducted on a sample of size $m = 1200$, of whom $x = 72$ were seropositive.\nThe estimated cumulative incidence, $\\widehat{\\Pi}$, is the proportion of seropositive individuals in the sample:\n$$\\widehat{\\Pi} = \\frac{x}{m} = \\frac{72}{1200} = 0.06$$\n\n**1) Derivation and Computation of the Point Estimator $\\widehat{\\bar{p}}$**\n\nThe average reporting probability, $\\bar{p}$, is defined by the relationship between the expected number of reported cases, $\\mathbb{E}[C]$, and the total number of infections in the population, $N\\Pi$. The problem states this relationship as:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[C] = \\bar{p} N \\Pi$$\nTo derive a point estimator for $\\bar{p}$, we employ the method of moments. We replace the population parameters and expected values with their corresponding sample estimates. The observed cumulative count $C$ is a natural estimator for its expectation $\\mathbb{E}[C]$, and the sample proportion $\\widehat{\\Pi}$ is a consistent estimator for the true cumulative incidence $\\Pi$.\nSubstituting these estimators into the defining equation gives an estimating equation for $\\bar{p}$:\n$$C \\approx \\widehat{\\bar{p}} N \\widehat{\\Pi}$$\nSolving for $\\widehat{\\bar{p}}$, we obtain the point estimator:\n$$\\widehat{\\bar{p}} = \\frac{C}{N \\widehat{\\Pi}}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values we calculated:\n$$\\widehat{\\bar{p}} = \\frac{12{,}000}{800{,}000 \\times 0.06} = \\frac{12{,}000}{48{,}000} = 0.25$$\n\n**2) Derivation and Computation of the Standard Error $\\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\widehat{\\bar{p}})$**\n\nTo find the standard error of $\\widehat{\\bar{p}}$, we first find its approximate variance using the delta method. Our estimator $\\widehat{\\bar{p}}$ is a function of two independent random variables, $C$ and $\\widehat{\\Pi}$:\n$$\\widehat{\\bar{p}} = g(C, \\widehat{\\Pi}) = \\frac{C}{N\\widehat{\\Pi}}$$\nThe delta method states that for a function of two independent random variables, the variance can be approximated as:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(\\widehat{\\bar{p}}) \\approx \\left( \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial C} \\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(C) + \\left( \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\widehat{\\Pi}} \\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(\\widehat{\\Pi})$$\nThe partial derivatives must be evaluated at the means of $C$ and $\\widehat{\\Pi}$. In practice, we evaluate them at the estimated values.\n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivatives of $g(C, \\widehat{\\Pi})$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial C} = \\frac{1}{N\\widehat{\\Pi}}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\widehat{\\Pi}} = -\\frac{C}{N\\widehat{\\Pi}^2}$$\nNext, we use the variance approximations provided in the problem statement. The variance of the cumulative count $C$ is estimated by $C$ itself, based on the Poisson model assumption:\n$$\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(C) = C = 12{,}000$$\nThe variance of the cumulative incidence estimate $\\widehat{\\Pi}$ is given by the binomial proportion variance formula:\n$$\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\widehat{\\Pi}) = \\frac{\\widehat{\\Pi}(1 - \\widehat{\\Pi})}{m} = \\frac{0.06 \\times (1 - 0.06)}{1200} = \\frac{0.06 \\times 0.94}{1200} = \\frac{0.0564}{1200} = 0.000047$$\nNow we substitute these derivatives and variance estimates into the delta method formula. We evaluate the partial derivatives at the observed values of $C$ and $\\widehat{\\Pi}$:\n$$\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\widehat{\\bar{p}}) \\approx \\left( \\frac{1}{N\\widehat{\\Pi}} \\right)^2 \\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(C) + \\left( -\\frac{C}{N\\widehat{\\Pi}^2} \\right)^2 \\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\widehat{\\Pi})$$\nA more elegant simplification is achieved by substituting $\\widehat{\\bar{p}} = C/(N\\widehat{\\Pi})$:\n$$\\frac{1}{N\\widehat{\\Pi}} = \\frac{\\widehat{\\bar{p}}}{C} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{C}{N\\widehat{\\Pi}^2} = \\frac{\\widehat{\\bar{p}}}{\\widehat{\\Pi}}$$\nSubstituting these into the variance formula:\n$$\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\widehat{\\bar{p}}) \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\widehat{\\bar{p}}}{C}\\right)^2 C + \\left(-\\frac{\\widehat{\\bar{p}}}{\\widehat{\\Pi}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\widehat{\\Pi}(1 - \\widehat{\\Pi})}{m}\\right)$$\n$$\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\widehat{\\bar{p}}) \\approx \\frac{\\widehat{\\bar{p}}^2}{C} + \\frac{\\widehat{\\bar{p}}^2}{\\widehat{\\Pi}^2} \\frac{\\widehat{\\Pi}(1 - \\widehat{\\Pi})}{m} = \\widehat{\\bar{p}}^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{C} + \\frac{1 - \\widehat{\\Pi}}{m\\widehat{\\Pi}} \\right)$$\nThis final expression relates the relative variance of $\\widehat{\\bar{p}}$ to the sum of the relative variances of $C$ and $\\widehat{\\Pi}$. We can now compute the numerical value for the variance:\n$$\\frac{1}{C} = \\frac{1}{12{,}000}$$\n$$\\frac{1 - \\widehat{\\Pi}}{m\\widehat{\\Pi}} = \\frac{1 - 0.06}{1200 \\times 0.06} = \\frac{0.94}{72}$$\n$$\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\widehat{\\bar{p}}) \\approx (0.25)^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{12{,}000} + \\frac{0.94}{72} \\right)$$\n$$\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\widehat{\\bar{p}}) \\approx 0.0625 \\left( 0.00008333\\ldots + 0.01305555\\ldots \\right)$$\n$$\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\widehat{\\bar{p}}) \\approx 0.0625 \\times (0.01313888\\ldots) \\approx 0.0008211805\\ldots$$\nThe standard error is the square root of the variance:\n$$\\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\widehat{\\bar{p}}) = \\sqrt{\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\widehat{\\bar{p}})} \\approx \\sqrt{0.0008211805\\ldots} \\approx 0.02865623$$\nRounding the estimates to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\\widehat{\\bar{p}} = 0.2500$$\n$$\\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\widehat{\\bar{p}}) \\approx 0.02866$$\nThe final result is the pair $(\\widehat{\\bar{p}}, \\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\widehat{\\bar{p}}))$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.2500 & 0.02866\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4630172"}]}
