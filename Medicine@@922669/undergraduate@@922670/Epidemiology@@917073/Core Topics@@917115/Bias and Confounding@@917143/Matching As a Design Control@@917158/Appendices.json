Age is associated with both exposure and disease and is therefore a potential confounder. Investigators use frequency matching on age strata (age $ 50$ years versus age $\\ge 50$ years) when selecting controls, so that the age distribution of controls mirrors the age distribution of cases. Consider the following scientifically plausible configuration: the disease is more common in the older stratum, and exposure is more prevalent among older workers.\n\nThe fundamental base for analysis is the definition of a confounder (a variable associated with the exposure and independently associated with the outcome) and the property that, in a case-control design, the stratum-specific odds ratio (OR) for the association between exposure and disease is identifiable from the exposure odds among cases relative to controls within strata. Matching is a design tool that secures comparability of matched factors between cases and controls, but in frequency matching it does not, by itself, remove confounding unless the matched factor is accounted for in the analysis.\n\nSuppose the following stratum-specific information holds:\n\n- In the younger stratum ($S_1$: age $ 50$), among controls the exposure prevalence is $p_{E|C,S_1}=0.10$ and the stratum-specific disease-exposure association is $\\mathrm{OR}_{S_1}=3$.\n- In the older stratum ($S_2$: age $\\ge 50$), among controls the exposure prevalence is $p_{E|C,S_2}=0.50$ and the stratum-specific disease-exposure association is $\\mathrm{OR}_{S_2}=3$.\n\nThe age distribution of cases is: $n_{S_1}^{\\text{cases}}=300$ and $n_{S_2}^{\\text{cases}}=700$; controls are frequency matched $1{:}1$ on age, so $n_{S_1}^{\\text{controls}}=300$ and $n_{S_2}^{\\text{controls}}=700$.\n\nUsing these inputs and only the fundamental definitions above:\n\n1.

In this scenario, failing to adjust for age in the frequency-matched analysis biases the exposure effect toward the null; numerically, $\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{crude}}\\approx 2.45$ whereas $\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{adj}}=3.00$, because matching inflates the exposure prevalence among controls when exposure is more common in the older stratum that is overrepresented among cases.\n\nB. The crude and adjusted odds ratios coincide under frequency matching, so ignoring age yields no bias in the estimated exposure effect.\n\nC. Failing to adjust biases the exposure effect away from the null; the crude odds ratio will exceed the adjusted odds ratio because age is positively associated with both exposure and disease.\n\nD. Matching at the design stage completely removes confounding; adjusting for the matching variable in the analysis is unnecessary and would introduce bias.", "solution": "We begin from first principles relevant to epidemiologic study design and analysis:\n\n- A confounder is a variable associated with the exposure and independently associated with the outcome; if not controlled, it distorts the exposure–outcome association.\n- In a case-control study, the odds ratio (OR) comparing exposure odds among cases versus controls within a stratum identifies the disease–exposure association for that stratum, regardless of the sampling fractions, provided selection is independent of exposure conditional on case/control status and the stratum.\n- Frequency matching is a design strategy to make the distribution of matching variables similar between cases and controls. However, unlike individual matching analyzed with appropriate conditional methods, frequency matching does not, by itself, eliminate confounding; the matching variable must be included in the analysis to correctly account for its association with exposure and disease.\n- Mantel–Haenszel (MH) stratified adjustment aggregates stratum-specific $2{\\times}2$ tables to estimate a common odds ratio when the stratum-specific odds ratios are approximately homogeneous.\n\nStep 1: Compute exposure counts by stratum, then compute the crude odds ratio ignoring age.\n\nControls by stratum have exposure prevalences:\n- $S_1$: $p_{E|C,S_1}=0.10 \\Rightarrow$ exposed controls in $S_1$ are $0.10\\times 300=30$ and unexposed controls are $300-30=270$.\n- $S_2$: $p_{E|C,S_2}=0.50 \\Rightarrow$ exposed controls in $S_2$ are $0.50\\times 700=350$ and unexposed controls are $700-350=350$.\n\nGiven $\\mathrm{OR}_{S_1}=\\mathrm{OR}_{S_2}=3$, compute the expected exposure prevalence among cases within each stratum from the control exposure odds.

The underlying mechanism is rooted in the design and confounding structure: older individuals are both more likely to be diseased and more likely to be exposed. Frequency matching forces the control age distribution to mirror the case age distribution, thereby oversampling older controls. Because exposure is more prevalent in the older stratum, the exposure prevalence among controls is elevated relative to what it would be under an age-representative sample of the source population. This inflation of control exposure prevalence pulls the crude odds ratio toward $1$, attenuating the estimated effect. Proper stratified adjustment (or inclusion of matching variables in regression) restores the correct comparability and recovers the common stratum-specific association.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\n- Option A: It states bias toward the null with numerical confirmation $\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{crude}}\\approx 2.45$ versus $\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{adj}}=3.00$, and correctly explains that frequency matching inflates exposure prevalence among controls when exposure is more common in the overrepresented older stratum. This matches the derivation. Verdict: Correct.\n\n- Option B: It claims crude and adjusted odds ratios coincide under frequency matching. This is incorrect: frequency matching requires adjustment for the matching variable to remove confounding and to account for the sampling design; our computation shows $\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{crude}}\\ne \\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{adj}}$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- Option C: It asserts bias away from the null (crude exceeding adjusted). Our derivation shows the opposite: $\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{crude}}\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{adj}}$ because controls’ exposure prevalence is elevated by oversampling older controls. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- Option D: It claims that matching at design completely removes confounding and that adjustment would introduce bias. In frequency matching, matching does not remove confounding by itself; adjustment is necessary. Our example demonstrates that failure to adjust produces bias.

Let the exposure indicator be $E \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and the disease indicator be $D \\in \\{0,1\\}$, and let matching variables be denoted by $M$.

In a $1:1$ matched study, each matched set, or pair, consists of one case ($D=1$) and one control ($D=0$). The data are summarized by the exposure status within each pair. Let $E_{case}$ and $E_{control}$ be the exposure status ($1$ for exposed, $0$ for unexposed) for the case and control in a given pair, respectively. The data are categorized into four types of pairs:\n1.  Both exposed ($E_{case}=1, E_{control}=1$): Count $a = 110$. These are concordant pairs.\n2.  Case exposed, control unexposed ($E_{case}=1, E_{control}=0$): Count $b = 57$. These are discordant pairs.\n3.  Case unexposed, control exposed ($E_{case}=0, E_{control}=1$): Count $c = 23$. These are discordant pairs.\n4.  Both unexposed ($E_{case}=0, E_{control}=0$): Count $d = 60$. These are concordant pairs.\n\nThe appropriate estimator is derived using a conditional likelihood approach. This method conditions on the set of exposures observed within each pair, which has the effect of eliminating the nuisance parameters specific to each matched set (stratum).\n\nConsider a single matched pair, indexed by $i$, with matching factors $M_i$. The parameter of interest is the odds ratio ($\\text{OR}$), assumed to be constant across all strata defined by $M$. The odds ratio relates exposure and disease:\n$$ \\text{OR} = \\frac{P(E=1|D=1, M_i)/P(E=0|D=1, M_i)}{P(E=1|D=0, M_i)/P(E=0|D=0, M_i)} $$\nLet $p_{1i} = P(E=1|D=1, M_i)$ be the probability of exposure for the case in pair $i$, and $p_{0i} = P(E=1|D=0, M_i)$ be the probability of exposure for the control in pair $i$. The stratum-specific odds ratio is $\\text{OR}_i = \\frac{p_{1i}/(1-p_{1i})}{p_{0i}/(1-p_{0i})}$. We assume $\\text{OR}_i = \\text{OR}$ for all $i$.\n\nThe conditional likelihood approach considers only the discordant pairs, as the concordant pairs provide no information about the odds ratio. For a pair to be discordant, one subject must be exposed and the other unexposed. We calculate the probability of the observed arrangement (which subject is the case) given that the pair is discordant.\n\nThe probability of observing a type-$b$ pair (case exposed, control unexposed) is proportional to $P(E=1|D=1, M_i)P(E=0|D=0, M_i) \\propto p_{1i}(1-p_{0i})$.\nThe probability of observing a type-$c$ pair (case unexposed, control exposed) is proportional to $P(E=0|D=1, M_i)P(E=1|D=0, M_i) \\propto (1-p_{1i})p_{0i}$.\n\nThe conditional probability that the case is the exposed subject, given the pair is discordant, is:\n$$ P(\\text{case exposed} | \\text{discordant}, M_i) = \\frac{p_{1i}(1-p_{0i})}{p_{1i}(1-p_{0i}) + (1-p_{1i})p_{0i}} $$\nWe can simplify this expression by dividing the numerator and denominator by $(1-p_{1i})(1-p_{0i})$:\n$$ P(\\text{case exposed} | \\text{discordant}, M_i) = \\frac{\\frac{p_{1i}}{1-p_{1i}}}{\\frac{p_{1i}}{1-p_{1i}} + \\frac{p_{0i}}{1-p_{0i}}} $$\nRecognizing the terms as the odds of exposure for the case and control, and using the definition of the odds ratio, $\\text{OR} = \\frac{p_{1i}/(1-p_{1i})}{p_{0i}/(1-p_{0i})}$, we can write the case's odds of exposure as $\\text{OR} \\times (\\text{odds for control})$. Substituting this:\n$$ P(\\text{case exposed} | \\text{discordant}, M_i) = \\frac{\\text{OR} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{p_{0i}}{1-p_{0i}}\\right)}{\\text{OR} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{p_{0i}}{1-p_{0i}}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{p_{0i}}{1-p_{0i}}\\right)} = \\frac{\\text{OR}}{\\text{OR} + 1} $$\nSimilarly, the conditional probability that the control is the exposed subject (i.e., the case is unexposed), given the pair is discordant, is:\n$$ P(\\text{case unexposed} | \\text{discordant}, M_i) = \\frac{(1-p_{1i})p_{0i}}{p_{1i}(1-p_{0i}) + (1-p_{1i})p_{0i}} = \\frac{\\frac{p_{0i}}{1-p_{0i}}}{\\frac{p_{1i}}{1-p_{1i}} + \\frac{p_{0i}}{1-p_{0i}}} = \\frac{1}{\\text{OR} + 1} $$\nThe total conditional likelihood, $L(\\text{OR})$, is the product of these probabilities over all $b+c$ discordant pairs.

It depends only on the counts of the discordant pairs.\n\nUsing the data provided ($a=110$, $d=60$, $b=57$, $c=23$), we can compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\widehat{\\text{OR}}_M = \\frac{57}{23} \\approx 2.4782608... $$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures, the value is $2.48$.\n\nThe second part of the question asks for the interpretation of the causal parameter this estimator targets, under the assumptions of conditional exchangeability, consistency, and positivity.\n1.  **Conditional Exchangeability:** Within strata of the matching factors $M$ (age, sex, workplace), an individual's potential for developing asthma exacerbation is independent of their actual exposure status. This implies that $M$ is a sufficient set of variables to control for all confounding between the exposure $E$ and the outcome $D$.\n2.  **Consistency:** An individual's observed outcome equals their potential outcome corresponding to their observed exposure level.\n3.  **Positivity:** Within each stratum of $M$, there are both exposed and unexposed individuals.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the associational odds ratio, which is what $\\widehat{\\text{OR}}_M$ estimates, is equivalent to the causal odds ratio. The parameter estimated by $b/c$ is the common conditional odds ratio, assumed constant across strata of $M$. This causal parameter is the ratio of the odds of asthma exacerbation if subjects were exposed to the odds of asthma exacerbation if the very same subjects were unexposed, within any given stratum of age, sex, and workplace. A value of $2.48$ implies that the odds of asthma exacerbation are $2.48$ times higher under the condition of having the occupational exposure compared to the counterfactual condition of not having the exposure, for individuals with the same age, sex, and workplace characteristics.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.48}$$", "id": "4610053"}, {"introduction": "While matching is a powerful tool for confounder control, matching on the wrong variable—a phenomenon known as 'overmatching'—can be detrimental to a study.

Confounding is present when a third variable $C$ is associated with $E$, is a cause of $D$, and is not on the causal pathway from $E$ to $D$. A collider is a variable $S$ that is causally affected by two or more variables (for example, $E \\to S \\leftarrow U$), and conditioning on a collider can create a noncausal association between its causes.

I will proceed with the analysis of each option.\n\n### Analysis\nThe central task is to evaluate the consequences of matching on four different types of variables ($R, S, B, M$) in a case-control study of the effect of exposure $E$ on disease $D$. The key principles to apply are:\n1.  **Confounding Control**: Matching is appropriate for a confounder $C$ (a common cause of $E$ and $D$, i.e., $E \\leftarrow C \\to D$). Matching on $C$ blocks the \"backdoor path\" from $E$ to $D$, thus controlling confounding.\n2.  **Collider Bias**: Conditioning on a collider (a common effect, e.g., $E \\to S \\leftarrow U$) induces a spurious association between its causes. If one of these causes ($U$) is also a cause of the outcome ($D$), this can create a non-causal association between $E$ and $D$. Matching is a form of conditioning.\n3.  **Mediation**: Conditioning on a mediator $M$ in the causal pathway ($E \\to M \\to D$) blocks the part of the causal effect transmitted through $M$. This leads to a biased estimate of the *total* causal effect of $E$ on $D$. This is sometimes called \"overmatching\" that induces bias.\n4.  **Efficiency and Precision**:\n    - Matching on a variable strongly correlated with exposure $E$ but not an independent cause of disease $D$ (and not a confounder) can reduce statistical efficiency. It makes cases and controls too similar with respect to exposure, reducing the study's power to detect an effect.\n    - Matching on a variable that is a strong cause of disease $D$ but is un-correlated with exposure $E$ can increase statistical precision (efficiency). It balances a major risk factor between cases and controls, reducing random variability and making the effect of $E$ easier to detect.\n\nNow, I will evaluate each option based on these principles and the provided causal structures.\n\n**Option A: Matching on $R$**\nThe causal structure for $R$ is $R \\to E \\to D$. $R$ is an instrumental variable for $E$. It affects $D$ only through its effect on $E$. $R$ is not a confounder because it is not a cause of $D$ independent of its path through $E$. Matching on $R$ means selecting controls with a similar residential distance to the plant as cases. Since $R$ is a strong predictor of exposure $E$, this will result in controls having an exposure distribution that is more similar to that of the cases than would be found in the general source population. This reduction in exposure variability between the case and control groups diminishes the statistical power to detect an association between $E$ and $D$. This is a loss of statistical efficiency. Since $R$ is not a confounder and not part of a collider structure with another cause of $D$, matching on it does not introduce bias, provided that a matched analysis (e.g., conditional logistic regression) is performed. Therefore, matching on $R$ is a classic example of overmatching that primarily reduces efficiency without introducing bias.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B: Matching on $S$**\nThe causal structure is $E \\to S \\leftarrow U$, where $U$ is a cause of $D$ ($U \\to D$). $S$ is a collider, as it is a common effect of the exposure $E$ and another risk factor $U$. Matching on $S$ is a form of conditioning on $S$. Conditioning on a collider opens a non-causal path between its causes, $E$ and $U$. This creates a spurious association between $E$ and $U$. Because $U$ is a cause of the disease $D$, this spurious association between $E$ and $U$ will translate into a spurious, non-causal association between $E$ and $D$. The path opened is $E \\text{ (non-causal)} \\leftrightarrow U \\to D$. This introduces bias, known as collider-stratification bias or selection bias. The statement accurately describes this mechanism.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option C: Matching on $B$**\nThe causal structure involves $B \\to D$, with $B$ being independent of $E$. $B$ is a risk factor for the disease but is not associated with the exposure. Therefore, $B$ is not a confounder of the $E-D$ relationship. Matching on $B$ means that for each case from a certain birth cohort, a control from the same birth cohort is selected. This ensures that the case and control groups are balanced with respect to $B$. Since $B$ is a cause of $D$, this removes the variation in disease risk attributable to $B$, which can increase the statistical precision (efficiency) of the estimate for the effect of $E$. Because $B$ is not associated with $E$ and is not a collider or mediator, matching on it does not introduce bias. The statement correctly identifies this as a beneficial matching strategy that improves precision without inducing bias, and is therefore not a case of overmatching.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option D: Matching on $M$**\nThe causal structure is $E \\to M \\to D$, meaning $M$ is a mediator of the effect of $E$ on $D$. The total effect of $E$ on $D$ is the sum of any direct effect and the indirect effect that passes through $M$. If we match on $M$, we are conditioning on it. This blocks the indirect causal pathway $E \\to M \\to D$. The resulting analysis would only estimate the direct effect of $E$ on $D$ that is not mediated by $M$. Estimating the direct effect when the quantity of interest is the total effect is a form of bias. The statement claims matching on $M$ \"would not bias estimation of the total effect of $E$ on $D$\". This is false. It fundamentally misunderstands the concept of mediation and conditioning on an intermediate variable. While there may also be efficiency consequences, the primary and most significant consequence is the introduction of bias for the total effect estimate.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nSummary of verdicts: Statements A, B, and C are correct, while statement D is incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "4610239"}]}
