This requires the calculation of two main quantities: the true population mean outcome, $E[Y]$, and the naive mean outcome within the selected (volunteer) group, $E[Y \\mid S=1]$.\n\nFirst, we compute the true population mean outcome, $E[Y]$, using the law of total expectation (LOTE) by conditioning on the baseline risk stratum, $Z$.\n$$E[Y] = \\sum_{z \\in \\{0,1\\}} E[Y \\mid Z=z] P(Z=z) = E[Y \\mid Z=0]P(Z=0) + E[Y \\mid Z=1]P(Z=1)$$\nThe term $E[Y \\mid Z=z]$ is the expected outcome within each risk stratum.

This implies that $E[Y \\mid X,Z,S=1] = E[Y \\mid X,Z]$ and $P(X \\mid Z,S=1) = P(X \\mid Z)$. Therefore, the expectation of $Y$ within a stratum is unchanged by conditioning on selection:\n$E[Y \\mid S=1, Z=z] = E[Y \\mid Z=z]$.\nWe have already calculated these values:\n$E[Y \\mid S=1, Z=1] = E[Y \\mid Z=1] = 0.20$.\n$E[Y \\mid S=1, Z=0] = E[Y \\mid Z=0] = 0.06$.\n\nNow we can assemble the expression for $E[Y \\mid S=1]$:\n$E[Y \\mid S=1] = E[Y \\mid S=1, Z=0]P(Z=0 \\mid S=1) + E[Y \\mid S=1, Z=1]P(Z=1 \\mid S=1)$\n$E[Y \\mid S=1] = (0.06)\\left(\\frac{14}{17}\\right) + (0.20)\\left(\\frac{3}{17}\\right) = \\frac{0.84 + 0.60}{17} = \\frac{1.44}{17} \\approx 0.08470588...$\n\n1.
