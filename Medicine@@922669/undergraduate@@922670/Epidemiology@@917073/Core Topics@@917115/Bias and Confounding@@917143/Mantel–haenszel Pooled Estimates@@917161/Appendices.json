Within each stratum, the following $2 \\times 2$ counts are observed:\n\nFor $Z=0$: among the exposed, $a_{0} = 5$ cases ($D=1$) and $b_{0} = 15$ non-cases ($D=0$); among the unexposed, $c_{0} = 10$ cases and $d_{0} = 90$ non-cases.\n\nFor $Z=1$: among the exposed, $a_{1} = 60$ cases and $b_{1} = 30$ non-cases; among the unexposed, $c_{1} = 40$ cases and $d_{1} = 60$ non-cases.\n\nUsing only core definitions of odds and odds ratio, first compute the marginal (crude) odds ratio between $E$ and $D$ ignoring $Z$.

This can distort the marginal association between $E$ and $D$. Let's examine if $Z$ meets the criteria for a confounder in this dataset.\n\n1.  **Association between $Z$ and $D$:** $Z$ must be a risk factor for the outcome $D$. We can check this by comparing the risk (or odds) of disease across the strata of $Z$, holding exposure constant (e.g., among the unexposed).\n    - Odds of disease in stratum $Z=0$ (low risk), among unexposed: $\\frac{c_{0}}{d_{0}} = \\frac{10}{90} = \\frac{1}{9}$\n    - Odds of disease in stratum $Z=1$ (high risk), among unexposed: $\\frac{c_{1}}{d_{1}} = \\frac{40}{60} = \\frac{2}{3}$\n    Since $\\frac{1}{9} \\neq \\frac{2}{3}$, $Z$ is associated with the outcome $D$. The baseline odds of disease are higher in the $Z=1$ stratum.\n\n2.  **Association between $Z$ and $E$:** The distribution of the exposure $E$ must differ across the strata of $Z$.\n    - Proportion of exposed in stratum $Z=0$: $P(E=1|Z=0) = \\frac{a_{0}+b_{0}}{a_{0}+b_{0}+c_{0}+d_{0}} = \\frac{5+15}{120} = \\frac{20}{120} = \\frac{1}{6}$\n    - Proportion of exposed in stratum $Z=1$: $P(E=1|Z=1) = \\frac{a_{1}+b_{1}}{a_{1}+b_{1}+c_{1}+d_{1}} = \\frac{60+30}{190} = \\frac{90}{190} = \\frac{9}{19}$\n    Since $\\frac{1}{6} \\neq \\frac{9}{19}$, the exposure is not distributed equally across the strata of $Z$. Specifically, exposed individuals are more prevalent in the high-risk stratum ($Z=1$).\n\nBecause $Z$ is associated with both $D$ and $E$, it is a confounder. The marginal odds ratio is a distorted measure of the $E-D$ association. To see the undistorted association, we compute the odds ratio within each stratum.\n\n- Stratum $Z=0$: $OR_{0} = \\frac{a_{0}d_{0}}{b_{0}c_{0}} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 90}{15 \\cdot 10} = \\frac{450}{150} = 3$\n- Stratum $Z=1$: $OR_{1} = \\frac{a_{1}d_{1}}{b_{1}c_{1}} = \\frac{60 \\cdot 60}{30 \\cdot 40} = \\frac{3600}{1200} = 3$\n\nThe stratum-specific odds ratios are both equal to $3$. This common value represents the association between $E$ and $D$ after controlling for $Z$. The crude odds ratio ($13/3 \\approx 4.33$) is greater than the stratum-specific odds ratios ($3$). This inflation, known as positive confounding, occurred because the exposed group had a higher proportion of individuals from the high-risk stratum ($Z=1$), artificially increasing the overall disease frequency in the exposed group compared to the unexposed.\n\n**Part 3: Mantel-Haenszel (MH) Pooled Odds Ratio**\n\nThe Mantel-Haenszel method provides a pooled odds ratio that adjusts for the confounding by $Z$. It is a weighted average of the stratum-specific odds ratios. The formula is:\n$$ OR_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{i} \\frac{a_{i}d_{i}}{n_{i}}}{\\sum_{i} \\frac{b_{i}c_{i}}{n_{i}}} $$\nwhere $i$ indexes the strata (here, $i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$) and $n_{i} = a_{i}+b_{i}+c_{i}+d_{i}$ is the total number of subjects in stratum $i$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total subjects in each stratum:\n- $n_{0} = 5 + 15 + 10 + 90 = 120$\n- $n_{1} = 60 + 30 + 40 + 60 = 190$\n\nNow, we compute the numerator of the $OR_{MH}$ formula:\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{1} \\frac{a_{i}d_{i}}{n_{i}} = \\frac{a_{0}d_{0}}{n_{0}} + \\frac{a_{1}d_{1}}{n_{1}} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 90}{120} + \\frac{60 \\cdot 60}{190} = \\frac{450}{120} + \\frac{3600}{190} $$\n$$ = \\frac{45}{12} + \\frac{360}{19} = \\frac{15}{4} + \\frac{360}{19} = \\frac{15 \\cdot 19 + 360 \\cdot 4}{4 \\cdot 19} = \\frac{285 + 1440}{76} = \\frac{1725}{76} $$\n\nNext, we compute the denominator of the $OR_{MH}$ formula:\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{1} \\frac{b_{i}c_{i}}{n_{i}} = \\frac{b_{0}c_{0}}{n_{0}} + \\frac{b_{1}c_{1}}{n_{1}} = \\frac{15 \\cdot 10}{120} + \\frac{30 \\cdot 40}{190} = \\frac{150}{120} + \\frac{1200}{190} $$\n$$ = \\frac{15}{12} + \\frac{120}{19} = \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{120}{19} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 19 + 120 \\cdot 4}{4 \\cdot 19} = \\frac{95 + 480}{76} = \\frac{575}{76} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the Mantel-Haenszel pooled odds ratio:\n$$ OR_{MH} = \\frac{\\frac{1725}{76}}{\\frac{575}{76}} = \\frac{1725}{575} $$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by common factors. Both are divisible by $25$:\n$$ \\frac{1725 \\div 25}{575 \\div 25} = \\frac{69}{23} $$\nRecognizing that $69 = 3 \\times 23$:\n$$ OR_{MH} = 3 $$\nThe Mantel-Haenszel pooled odds ratio is $3$. This value correctly reflects the common stratum-specific odds ratio, providing an adjusted measure of association free from the confounding effect of $Z$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "4609381"}, {"introduction": "Confounding can sometimes produce a particularly counterintuitive result known as Simpson's Paradox, where the trend observed in the overall data is reversed within the subgroups.

These are standard, well-established techniques. The data are counts (non-negative integers), which is appropriate for this type of study.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined and provides all necessary numerical data to calculate the requested quantities. The question is specific and leads to a unique numerical answer. There are no zero counts in the cells required for the odds ratio calculations, so the quantities are well-defined.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language without ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formally structured, complete, and contains no contradictions. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the full solution.\n\nThe odds ratio ($OR$) is a measure of association between an exposure and an outcome. It represents the odds that an outcome will occur given a particular exposure, compared to the odds of the outcome occurring in the absence of that exposure. For a single $2 \\times 2$ table, the odds ratio is calculated as:\n$$ OR = \\frac{(a/b)}{(c/d)} = \\frac{ad}{bc} $$\nAn $OR > 1$ suggests a harmful association (increased odds of the outcome with exposure), an $OR < 1$ suggests a protective association (decreased odds), and an $OR = 1$ suggests no association.\n\n**Crude Odds Ratio**\nFirst, we collapse the data across the two strata by summing the cell counts. The collapsed $2 \\times 2$ table is:\n-   $a_{crude} = a_{0} + a_{1} = 12 + 59 = 71$\n-   $b_{crude} = b_{0} + b_{1} = 8 + 921 = 929$\n-   $c_{crude} = c_{0} + c_{1} = 490 + 1 = 491$\n-   $d_{crude} = d_{0} + d_{1} = 490 + 19 = 509$\n\nThe crude odds ratio, $OR_{crude}$, is calculated from this collapsed table:\n$$ OR_{crude} = \\frac{a_{crude}d_{crude}}{b_{crude}c_{crude}} = \\frac{71 \\times 509}{929 \\times 491} = \\frac{36139}{456139} \\approx 0.079228 $$\nSince $OR_{crude} < 1$, the crude analysis suggests a strong protective association between the exposure and the outcome.\n\n**Stratum-Specific Odds Ratios**\nNext, we compute the odds ratio within each stratum of the covariate $Z$.\nFor Stratum $Z=0$:\n$$ OR_{0} = \\frac{a_{0}d_{0}}{b_{0}c_{0}} = \\frac{12 \\times 490}{8 \\times 490} = \\frac{12}{8} = 1.5 $$\nSince $OR_{0} > 1$, the association within stratum $Z=0$ is harmful.\n\nFor Stratum $Z=1$:\n$$ OR_{1} = \\frac{a_{1}d_{1}}{b_{1}c_{1}} = \\frac{59 \\times 19}{921 \\times 1} = \\frac{1121}{921} \\approx 1.2172 $$\nSince $OR_{1} > 1$, the association within stratum $Z=1$ is also harmful.\n\nThis situation, where the crude measure of association shows a different direction of effect compared to the stratum-specific measures, is a classic example of Simpson's Paradox. The covariate $Z$ acts as a confounder, and collapsing the tables without accounting for $Z$ leads to a misleading conclusion.\n\n**Mantel–Haenszel Pooled Odds Ratio**\nThe Mantel–Haenszel method provides a way to combine stratum-specific odds ratios into a single summary measure, adjusted for the confounding effect of the stratification variable. The formula for the Mantel–Haenszel pooled odds ratio, $OR_{MH}$, for $k$ strata is:\n$$ OR_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{a_i d_i}{n_i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{b_i c_i}{n_i}} $$\nwhere $n_i = a_i + b_i + c_i + d_i$ is the total number of subjects in stratum $i$.\n\nWe have two strata ($i=0, 1$). First, we calculate the total size of each stratum:\n-   $n_{0} = a_{0} + b_{0} + c_{0} + d_{0} = 12 + 8 + 490 + 490 = 1000$\n-   $n_{1} = a_{1} + b_{1} + c_{1} + d_{1} = 59 + 921 + 1 + 19 = 1000$\n\nNow, we calculate the terms for the numerator and denominator of the $OR_{MH}$ formula.\nNumerator sum:\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{1} \\frac{a_i d_i}{n_i} = \\frac{a_{0}d_{0}}{n_{0}} + \\frac{a_{1}d_{1}}{n_{1}} = \\frac{12 \\times 490}{1000} + \\frac{59 \\times 19}{1000} = \\frac{5880}{1000} + \\frac{1121}{1000} = 5.880 + 1.121 = 7.001 $$\nDenominator sum:\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{1} \\frac{b_i c_i}{n_i} = \\frac{b_{0}c_{0}}{n_{0}} + \\frac{b_{1}c_{1}}{n_{1}} = \\frac{8 \\times 490}{1000} + \\frac{921 \\times 1}{1000} = \\frac{3920}{1000} + \\frac{921}{1000} = 3.920 + 0.921 = 4.841 $$\nFinally, we compute the Mantel–Haenszel pooled odds ratio:\n$$ OR_{MH} = \\frac{7.001}{4.841} \\approx 1.4461888 $$\nThe pooled odds ratio, adjusted for the covariate $Z$, is approximately $1.446$. This value is greater than $1$, indicating a harmful association, which is consistent with the findings within each stratum but opposite to the crude analysis.\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ OR_{MH} \\approx 1.446 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.446}$$", "id": "4609416"}, {"introduction": "Beyond confounding, the odds ratio has an intrinsic mathematical property called non-collapsibility, which can also cause the crude and adjusted estimates to differ.

By comparing the crude odds ratio with the Mantel-Haenszel pooled estimate in this unique context, you will gain a deeper understanding of why the adjusted estimate is often preferred, even in the absence of confounding [@problem_id:4609380].", "problem": "An investigator studies the association between a binary exposure $E$ and a binary disease outcome $D$ within two strata of a binary covariate $S \\in \\{0,1\\}$.

Round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires a multi-part analysis of epidemiological data stratified by a covariate $S$. We will address each part of the problem sequentially using fundamental definitions.\n\n1. Definition of Non-collapsibility\nAn effect measure, such as an odds ratio ($OR$) or risk ratio ($RR$), is said to be non-collapsible if the marginal (crude) measure is not equal to the common value of the stratum-specific (conditional) measures, even when the stratum-specific measures are homogeneous across strata and there is no confounding. Confounding is absent if the stratification variable is independent of the exposure. In such a scenario, any difference between the marginal and the common conditional effect measure is attributable to the mathematical properties of the measure itself, not to a confounding effect. This phenomenon typically occurs when the stratification variable is a risk factor for the outcome.\n\n2. Verification of Data Properties\nThe problem provides data for two strata, $S=0$ and $S=1$. The counts are given in the format $(a_s, b_s; c_s, d_s)$ corresponding to $(E=1, D=1)$, $(E=1, D=0)$; $(E=0, D=1)$, $(E=0, D=0)$ for each stratum $s$.\nFor $S=0$: $(a_0, b_0; c_0, d_0) = (200, 900; 110, 990)$.\nFor $S=1$: $(a_1, b_1; c_1, d_1) = (825, 275; 660, 440)$.\n\nFirst, we verify that the exposure distribution is identical across strata. This confirms the problem's statement that the covariate $S$ is independent of the exposure $E$. The total number of subjects in each stratum is:\n$N_0 = a_0 + b_0 + c_0 + d_0 = 200 + 900 + 110 + 990 = 2200$.\n$N_1 = a_1 + b_1 + c_1 + d_1 = 825 + 275 + 660 + 440 = 2200$.\n\nThe proportion of exposed individuals ($E=1$) in each stratum is:\n$P(E=1 | S=0) = \\frac{a_0 + b_0}{N_0} = \\frac{200 + 900}{2200} = \\frac{1100}{2200} = 0.5$.\n$P(E=1 | S=1) = \\frac{a_1 + b_1}{N_1} = \\frac{825 + 275}{2200} = \\frac{1100}{2200} = 0.5$.\nSince $P(E=1 | S=0) = P(E=1 | S=1)$, the exposure distribution is identical across strata, and $S$ is independent of $E$.\n\nNext, we verify that the stratum-specific odds ratios are equal. The odds ratio for stratum $s$ is calculated as $OR_s = \\frac{a_s d_s}{b_s c_s}$.\nFor stratum $S=0$:\n$$OR_0 = \\frac{a_0 d_0}{b_0 c_0} = \\frac{200 \\times 990}{900 \\times 110} = \\frac{198000}{99000} = 2$$\nFor stratum $S=1$:\n$$OR_1 = \\frac{a_1 d_1}{b_1 c_1} = \\frac{825 \\times 440}{275 \\times 660} = \\frac{363000}{181500} = 2$$\nThe stratum-specific odds ratios are indeed equal: $OR_0 = OR_1 = 2$. This condition is known as homogeneity of the odds ratio across strata.\n\n3. Computation of Pooled and Crude Odds Ratios\nThe Mantel-Haenszel (MH) pooled odds ratio is a weighted average of the stratum-specific odds ratios. The formula is:\n$$OR_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{s} \\frac{a_s d_s}{N_s}}{\\sum_{s} \\frac{b_s c_s}{N_s}}$$\nUsing the data:\n$$OR_{MH} = \\frac{\\frac{200 \\times 990}{2200} + \\frac{825 \\times 440}{2200}}{\\frac{900 \\times 110}{2200} + \\frac{275 \\times 660}{2200}} = \\frac{\\frac{198000}{2200} + \\frac{363000}{2200}}{\\frac{99000}{2200} + \\frac{181500}{2200}} = \\frac{90 + 165}{45 + 82.5} = \\frac{255}{127.5} = 2$$\nAs expected, when the stratum-specific odds ratios are homogeneous, the MH estimate equals their common value.\n\nTo compute the crude (marginal) odds ratio, we first collapse the data over the stratifying variable $S$:\n$a_{crude} = a_0 + a_1 = 200 + 825 = 1025$.\n$b_{crude} = b_0 + b_1 = 900 + 275 = 1175$.\n$c_{crude} = c_0 + c_1 = 110 + 660 = 770$.\n$d_{crude} = d_0 + d_1 = 990 + 440 = 1430$.\nThe marginal $2 \\times 2$ table is $(1025, 1175; 770, 1430)$.\n\nThe crude odds ratio is calculated from this collapsed table:\n$$OR_{crude} = \\frac{a_{crude} d_{crude}}{b_{crude} c_{crude}} = \\frac{1025 \\times 1430}{1175 \\times 770} = \\frac{1465750}{904750} \\approx 1.61999447...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $OR_{crude} \\approx 1.620$.\n\n4. Explanation of the Difference\nThe crude odds ratio ($OR_{crude} \\approx 1.620$) is different from the common conditional odds ratio ($OR_0 = OR_1 = OR_{MH} = 2$). This difference is not due to confounding. A confounder must be associated with both the exposure and the outcome. Here, we have shown that the stratifying variable $S$ is independent of the exposure $E$, so a necessary condition for confounding is not met.\n\nThe observed difference is a direct illustration of the non-collapsibility of the odds ratio. This mathematical property arises because the crude odds ratio is a ratio of crude odds, which are not simple weighted averages of the stratum-specific odds in a way that preserves the ratio. This happens when the stratifying variable ($S$) is a predictor of the outcome ($D$), even if it's not a confounder. We can verify that $S$ is a strong predictor of $D$:\nThe risk of disease in stratum $S=0$ is $P(D=1|S=0) = \\frac{a_0+c_0}{N_0} = \\frac{200+110}{2200} = \\frac{310}{2200} \\approx 0.141$.\nThe risk of disease in stratum $S=1$ is $P(D=1|S=1) = \\frac{a_1+c_1}{N_1} = \\frac{825+660}{2200} = \\frac{1485}{2200} \\approx 0.675$.\nSince these risks are vastly different, $S$ is a strong predictor of $D$.\n\nIn summary, the difference between the marginal $OR$ ($1.620$) and the conditional $OR$ ($2$) is due to the non-collapsibility of the odds ratio, which occurs because the covariate $S$ is associated with the outcome $D$ while being independent of the exposure $E$. The marginal $OR$ is a distorted measure of association in this case, and the conditional (or pooled) $OR$ is the appropriate measure of effect.\n\nThe problem asks for the crude (marginal) odds ratio collapsed over $S$.\n$OR_{crude} = \\frac{1025 \\times 1430}{1175 \\times 770} \\approx 1.61999447...$\nRounding to four significant figures yields $1.620$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.620}$$", "id": "4609380"}]}
