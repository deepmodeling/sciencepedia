This first exercise provides fundamental practice in calculating three key measures of interaction on the additive scale: the Relative Excess Risk due to Interaction (RERI), the Attributable Proportion due to interaction (AP), and the Synergy Index ($S$). Mastering these calculations is the essential first step to moving from raw risk data to a meaningful assessment of synergy or antagonism.

It is a standard quantitative exercise in epidemiology. The solution process may proceed.\n\n**Solution Development**\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of three measures of interaction on the additive scale. Let us denote the risks for the four exposure groups using a subscript notation where the first digit indicates exposure to $A$ ($1$ for yes, $0$ for no) and the second digit indicates exposure to $B$.\n\nThe given risks are:\n-   Risk with both exposures, $R_{11} = 0.20$\n-   Risk with exposure $A$ only, $R_{10} = 0.10$\n-   Risk with exposure $B$ only, $R_{01} = 0.15$\n-   Risk with neither exposure (baseline risk), $R_{00} = 0.40$\n\nThe measures of interaction are conventionally defined using risk ratios ($RR$). We first calculate the necessary risk ratios by comparing the risk in each exposed group to the baseline risk in the unexposed group ($R_{00}$).\n\nThe risk ratio for exposure to both $A$ and $B$ is:\n$$RR_{11} = \\frac{R_{11}}{R_{00}} = \\frac{0.20}{0.40} = \\frac{20}{40} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThe risk ratio for exposure to $A$ only is:\n$$RR_{10} = \\frac{R_{10}}{R_{00}} = \\frac{0.10}{0.40} = \\frac{10}{40} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nThe risk ratio for exposure to $B$ only is:\n$$RR_{01} = \\frac{R_{01}}{R_{00}} = \\frac{0.15}{0.40} = \\frac{15}{40} = \\frac{3}{8}$$\n\nWith these risk ratios, we can now compute the three requested quantities.\n\n**1. Relative Excess Risk due to Interaction (RERI)**\nThe RERI measures the departure from additivity of risk differences, expressed on a relative scale. In a scenario with no additive interaction, the excess risk from the combined exposure would equal the sum of the excess risks from the individual exposures: $R_{11} - R_{00} = (R_{10} - R_{00}) + (R_{01} - R_{00})$. Rearranging this gives the interaction contrast, $I_A = R_{11} - R_{10} - R_{01} + R_{00}$, which would be $0$ at the null. The RERI is this interaction contrast scaled by the baseline risk, $I_A/R_{00}$, which can be expressed in terms of risk ratios as:\n$$RERI = RR_{11} - RR_{10} - RR_{01} + 1$$\nA value of $RERI = 0$ indicates no additive interaction. Substituting the calculated risk ratios:\n$$RERI = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{3}{8} + 1$$\nWe use a common denominator of $8$ to perform the addition:\n$$RERI = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{2}{8} - \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{8}{8} = \\frac{4 - 2 - 3 + 8}{8} = \\frac{7}{8}$$\n\n**2. Attributable Proportion due to interaction (AP)**\nThe AP is the proportion of the risk in the group with both exposures that is attributable to the additive interaction itself. It is defined as:\n$$AP = \\frac{RERI}{RR_{11}}$$\nThis can also be written as a function of the risks: $AP = \\frac{R_{11} - R_{10} - R_{01} + R_{00}}{R_{11}}$.\nUsing the computed values for $RERI$ and $RR_{11}$:\n$$AP = \\frac{7/8}{1/2} = \\frac{7}{8} \\times \\frac{2}{1} = \\frac{14}{8} = \\frac{7}{4}$$\n\n**3. Synergy Index (S)**\nThe Synergy Index is another measure of additive interaction, defined as the ratio of the observed excess risk for the joint exposure to the sum of the excess risks for the individual exposures. The formula in terms of risk ratios is:\n$$S = \\frac{RR_{11} - 1}{(RR_{10} - 1) + (RR_{01} - 1)}$$\nA value of $S=1$ indicates no additive interaction.\nFirst, we compute the numerator and the two terms in the denominator:\n-   Numerator: $RR_{11} - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n-   Denominator: $(RR_{10} - 1) + (RR_{01} - 1) = \\left(\\frac{1}{4} - 1\\right) + \\left(\\frac{3}{8} - 1\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{3}{4}\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{5}{8}\\right)$\nTo sum the terms in the denominator, we use a common denominator of $8$:\n$$-\\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{5}{8} = -\\frac{6}{8} - \\frac{5}{8} = -\\frac{11}{8}$$\nNow we compute the ratio for $S$:\n$$S = \\frac{-1/2}{-11/8} = \\frac{1/2}{11/8} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{8}{11} = \\frac{8}{22} = \\frac{4}{11}$$\n\nThe three computed quantities, in the requested order (RERI, AP, $S$), are $\\frac{7}{8}$, $\\frac{7}{4}$, and $\\frac{4}{11}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{7}{8}  \\frac{7}{4}  \\frac{4}{11} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4370338"}, {"introduction": "A critical and often confusing concept is that the presence and direction of interaction depend entirely on the scale of measurement—additive or multiplicative.

A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nInteraction, or effect modification, assesses whether the effect of one exposure on an outcome is dependent on the presence of another exposure. The assessment depends on the scale of measurement: additive (based on risk differences) or multiplicative (based on risk ratios). The reference category for all comparisons is the group unexposed to both factors ($E_1=0, E_2=0$), which has a baseline risk of $p_{00} = 0.10$.\n\n#### 1. Additive Scale Interaction Analysis\n\nOn an additive scale, we compare risk differences (RD). The absence of interaction implies that the excess risk from the joint exposure is equal to the sum of the excess risks from each individual exposure.\n\n- The baseline risk is $p_{00} = 0.10$.\n- The excess risk due to $E_1$ alone is:\n  $$RD_{10} = p_{10} - p_{00} = 0.20 - 0.10 = 0.10$$\n- The excess risk due to $E_2$ alone is:\n  $$RD_{01} = p_{01} - p_{00} = 0.25 - 0.10 = 0.15$$\n- The expected excess risk for the joint exposure ($E_1=1, E_2=1$) under an additive model (i.e., no additive interaction) is the sum of the individual excess risks:\n  $$RD_{\\text{expected}} = RD_{10} + RD_{01} = 0.10 + 0.15 = 0.25$$\n- The observed excess risk for the joint exposure is:\n  $$RD_{11} = p_{11} - p_{00} = 0.40 - 0.10 = 0.30$$\n- To assess for interaction, we compare the observed joint excess risk ($RD_{11}$) with the expected joint excess risk ($RD_{10} + RD_{01}$):\n  $$RD_{11} \\text{ vs. } RD_{10} + RD_{01}$$\n  $$0.30 \\text{ vs. } 0.25$$\n- Since $0.30 > 0.25$, the observed joint excess risk is greater than the sum of the individual excess risks. This indicates a **positive interaction on the additive scale** (also called synergism). The magnitude of the interaction is $RD_{11} - (RD_{10} + RD_{01}) = 0.30 - 0.25 = 0.05$.\n\n#### 2. Multiplicative Scale Interaction Analysis\n\nOn a multiplicative scale, we compare risk ratios (RR). The absence of interaction implies that the joint risk ratio is equal to the product of the individual risk ratios.\n\n- The baseline risk is $p_{00} = 0.10$.\n- The risk ratio for $E_1$ alone is:\n  $$RR_{10} = \\frac{p_{10}}{p_{00}} = \\frac{0.20}{0.10} = 2.0$$\n- The risk ratio for $E_2$ alone is:\n  $$RR_{01} = \\frac{p_{01}}{p_{00}} = \\frac{0.25}{0.10} = 2.5$$\n- The expected risk ratio for the joint exposure ($E_1=1, E_2=1$) under a multiplicative model (i.e., no multiplicative interaction) is the product of the individual risk ratios:\n  $$RR_{\\text{expected}} = RR_{10} \\times RR_{01} = 2.0 \\times 2.5 = 5.0$$\n- The observed risk ratio for the joint exposure is:\n  $$RR_{11} = \\frac{p_{11}}{p_{00}} = \\frac{0.40}{0.10} = 4.0$$\n- To assess for interaction, we compare the observed joint risk ratio ($RR_{11}$) with the expected joint risk ratio ($RR_{10} \\times RR_{01}$):\n  $$RR_{11} \\text{ vs. } RR_{10} \\times RR_{01}$$\n  $$4.0 \\text{ vs. } 5.0$$\n- Since $4.0  5.0$, the observed joint risk ratio is less than the product of the individual risk ratios. This indicates a **negative interaction on the multiplicative scale** (also called antagonism).\n\n#### 3. Explanation for Discrepancy\n\nThe conclusion about interaction (presence, absence, or direction) can differ between the additive and multiplicative scales because the definition of \"no interaction\" is mathematically different for each scale.\n- **Additive no-interaction model:** $p_{11} - p_{00} = (p_{10} - p_{00}) + (p_{01} - p_{00})$\n- **Multiplicative no-interaction model:** $p_{11} / p_{00} = (p_{10} / p_{00}) \\times (p_{01} / p_{00})$\nThese two conditions are not equivalent. A dataset that satisfies one will generally not satisfy the other. Therefore, the same set of risks can demonstrate positive interaction on one scale and negative interaction on the other, as seen in this problem.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

Because the combined risk difference equals the sum of individual risk differences, there is no interaction on any scale; one should summarize findings with a single “synergy index” without distinguishing scales.", "solution": "We proceed from core epidemiologic definitions. Let $R_{ab} = \\Pr(Y=1 \\mid A=a,B=b)$ denote the risk in group $(a,b)$. The risk difference (RD) for exposure $A$ at $B=b$ is $\\text{RD}_{A \\mid b} = R_{1b} - R_{0b}$, and the risk ratio (RR) for exposure $A$ at $B=b$ is $\\text{RR}_{A \\mid b} = R_{1b} / R_{0b}$. Analogous quantities are defined for exposure $B$. The notion of “no interaction” depends on scale:\n- On the additive scale (risk difference), “no interaction” implies that the joint excess risk equals the sum of the individual excess risks, i.e., $R_{11} - R_{00} = (R_{10} - R_{00}) + (R_{01} - R_{00})$. Departures from this relationship indicate additive interaction, often summarized by the Interaction Contrast (IC), defined as $IC = R_{11} - R_{10} - R_{01} + R_{00}$.\n- On the multiplicative scale (risk ratio), “no interaction” implies that the joint risk ratio equals the product of the individual risk ratios, i.e., $R_{11}/R_{00} = (R_{10}/R_{00}) \\times (R_{01}/R_{00})$.\n\nStep 1: Compute risks in each group from the counts.\n- $R_{00} = 25/2500 = 0.01$,\n- $R_{10} = 75/2500 = 0.03$,\n- $R_{01} = 50/2500 = 0.02$,\n- $R_{11} = 150/2500 = 0.06$.\n\nStep 2: Assess additive interaction via risk differences and the Interaction Contrast (IC).\n- Joint excess risk: $R_{11} - R_{00} = 0.06 - 0.01 = 0.05$.\n- Sum of individual excess risks: $(R_{10} - R_{00}) + (R_{01} - R_{00}) = (0.03 - 0.01) + (0.02 - 0.01) = 0.02 + 0.01 = 0.03$.\n- Departure from additivity: $0.05 - 0.03 = 0.02 > 0$, indicating positive additive interaction.\n- Equivalently, the Interaction Contrast is $IC = R_{11} - R_{10} - R_{01} + R_{00} = 0.06 - 0.03 - 0.02 + 0.01 = 0.02 > 0$, confirming positive additive interaction.\n\nStep 3: Assess multiplicative interaction via risk ratios.\n- $\\text{RR}_{A \\mid B=0} = R_{10}/R_{00} = 0.03/0.01 = 3$.\n- $\\text{RR}_{B \\mid A=0} = R_{01}/R_{00} = 0.02/0.01 = 2$.\n- Joint risk ratio: $R_{11}/R_{00} = 0.06/0.01 = 6$.\n- Product of individual risk ratios: $3 \\times 2 = 6$.\n- Since $R_{11}/R_{00}$ equals $(R_{10}/R_{00}) \\times (R_{01}/R_{00})$, there is no multiplicative interaction.\n\nStep 4: Communication implications. Best practice is to specify the scale on which interaction is assessed and to align the message with the audience. For public health decision-making, additive interaction is often more directly interpretable because it relates to excess cases attributable to joint exposure beyond the sum of individual exposures. Here, the excess absolute risk due to interaction is $0.02$, which in a population of $2500$ jointly exposed corresponds to $0.02 \\times 2500 = 50$ additional cases beyond additivity over $10$ years.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- A. States “no interaction” without specifying scale and justifies it because the joint effect equals the product of individual effects. While it is true that there is no multiplicative interaction, there is positive additive interaction. Declaring “no interaction” without scale specification is a common communication pitfall. Verdict: Incorrect.\n- B. Accurately identifies positive interaction on the additive scale but none on the multiplicative scale and recommends specifying the scale and emphasizing excess absolute risk beyond the sum of individual risks, which aligns with best practice. Verdict: Correct.\n- C. Claims interaction should only be assessed using odds ratios and that risk ratios are misleading when disease is rare. In a cohort with directly estimated risks, risk ratios are appropriate. Odds ratios approximate risk ratios only under a rare disease assumption and are not required for interaction assessment; moreover, interaction can and should be assessed on clearly defined scales (additive or multiplicative) using risks or rates when available. Verdict: Incorrect.\n- D. Claims the combined risk difference equals the sum of individual risk differences and thus no interaction on any scale, and suggests using a single “synergy index” without distinguishing scales. The premise is false because $0.05 \\neq 0.03$; there is positive additive interaction. Additionally, reducing communication to a single index obscures the critical distinction between scales.
