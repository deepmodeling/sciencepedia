It provides a complete and consistent set of definitions and data to rigorously analyze the phenomenon of loss-to-follow-up bias in a cohort study. The problem is a standard, fundamental exercise in epidemiological methods and probability theory. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nFirst, we derive an expression for the observed risk in group $g$, denoted $r_{g}^{\\text{obs}} = \\Pr(Y=1 \\mid G=g, S=1)$, using the definitions provided. By the definition of conditional probability (Bayes' theorem), we can write:\n$$\nr_{g}^{\\text{obs}} = \\Pr(Y=1 \\mid G=g, S=1) = \\frac{\\Pr(Y=1, S=1 \\mid G=g)}{\\Pr(S=1 \\mid G=g)}\n$$\nThe numerator can be further expanded as:\n$$\n\\Pr(Y=1, S=1 \\mid G=g) = \\Pr(S=1 \\mid G=g, Y=1) \\Pr(Y=1 \\mid G=g)\n$$\nUsing the definitions provided in the problem statement, $\\Pr(Y=1 \\mid G=g) = r_g$ and $\\Pr(S=1 \\mid G=g, Y=1) = s_{g,1}$. Thus, the numerator is $s_{g,1} r_g$.\n\nThe denominator, $\\Pr(S=1 \\mid G=g)$, is the overall probability of being followed up within group $g$. We can expand this using the law of total probability, conditioning on the outcome status $Y$:\n$$\n\\Pr(S=1 \\mid G=g) = \\Pr(S=1 \\mid G=g, Y=1) \\Pr(Y=1 \\mid G=g) + \\Pr(S=1 \\mid G=g, Y=0) \\Pr(Y=0 \\mid G=g)\n$$\nSubstituting the provided definitions, we have $\\Pr(S=1 \\mid G=g, Y=1) = s_{g,1}$, $\\Pr(Y=1 \\mid G=g) = r_g$, $\\Pr(S=1 \\mid G=g, Y=0) = s_{g,0}$, and $\\Pr(Y=0 \\mid G=g) = 1 - r_g$. The denominator thus becomes:\n$$\n\\Pr(S=1 \\mid G=g) = s_{g,1} r_g + s_{g,0} (1 - r_g)\n$$\nCombining the numerator and denominator gives the final expression for the observed risk:\n$$\nr_{g}^{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{s_{g,1} r_g}{s_{g,1} r_g + s_{g,0} (1 - r_g)}\n$$\nThis expression demonstrates that the observed risk $r_{g}^{\\text{obs}}$ is equal to the true risk $r_g$ only if the denominator sums to $1$ (which is generally not true) or, more critically, if the selection is independent of the outcome, i.e., $s_{g,1} = s_{g,0}$. If $s_{g,1} = s_{g,0} = s_g$, the expression simplifies to $r_{g}^{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{s_{g} r_g}{s_{g} r_g + s_{g} (1 - r_g)} = \\frac{s_{g} r_g}{s_{g} (r_g + 1 - r_g)} = r_g$. In this case, there is no bias.\n\nNext, we demonstrate how outcome-dependent loss to follow-up (LTFU) can reverse the direction of the naive risk ratio. The true risk ratio is $\\text{RR}^{\\text{true}} = \\frac{r_1}{r_0}$. The naive risk ratio, calculated from the observed data, is $\\text{RR}^{\\text{naive}} = \\frac{r_1^{\\text{obs}}}{r_0^{\\text{obs}}}$. A reversal occurs if, for example, $\\text{RR}^{\\text{true}} < 1$ while $\\text{RR}^{\\text{naive}} > 1$.\n\nLet's analyze the bias. The observed risk is a biased estimate of the true risk whenever $s_{g,1} \\neq s_{g,0}$. If individuals who experience the event ($Y=1$) are more likely to be followed up than individuals who do not ($s_{g,1} > s_{g,0}$), the observed group will be enriched with cases, leading to an overestimation of the risk, $r_g^{\\text{obs}} > r_g$. Conversely, if $s_{g,1} < s_{g,0}$, the risk will be underestimated.\n\nA reversal of the risk ratio can occur if this bias is differential across the treatment and control groups. Consider a scenario where the true effect of the treatment is protective, so $r_1 < r_0$ and $\\text{RR}^{\\text{true}} < 1$. Suppose there is strong differential LTFU in the treated group such that individuals without the event are much more likely to be lost than individuals with the event ($s_{1,0} \\ll s_{1,1}$). This will substantially inflate the observed risk $r_1^{\\text{obs}}$. If, simultaneously, the LTFU in the control group is non-differential ($s_{0,1} \\approx s_{0,0}$), then $r_0^{\\text{obs}} \\approx r_0$. If the inflation in the treated group is large enough, it is possible for the inflated risk $r_1^{\\text{obs}}$ to become greater than the unbiased risk $r_0^{\\text{obs}}$, resulting in $\\text{RR}^{\\text{naive}} > 1$. This would erroneously suggest that the treatment is harmful when it is, in fact, protective.\n\nFinally, we compute the concrete example with the specified probabilities:\n- True risks: $r_{1} = 0.2$ and $r_{0} = 0.3$.\n- Follow-up probabilities: $s_{1,1} = 0.9$, $s_{1,0} = 0.3$, $s_{0,1} = 0.9$, and $s_{0,0} = 0.9$.\n\nThe true risk ratio is $\\text{RR}^{\\text{true}} = \\frac{r_1}{r_0} = \\frac{0.2}{0.3} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.6667$. Since $\\text{RR}^{\\text{true}} < 1$, the treatment is truly protective.\n\nNow, we compute the observed risks for each group using the derived formula.\nFor the treated group ($g=1$):\n$$\nr_{1}^{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{s_{1,1} r_1}{s_{1,1} r_1 + s_{1,0}(1-r_1)} = \\frac{(0.9)(0.2)}{(0.9)(0.2) + (0.3)(1-0.2)} = \\frac{0.18}{0.18 + (0.3)(0.8)} = \\frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.24} = \\frac{0.18}{0.42} = \\frac{18}{42} = \\frac{3}{7}\n$$\nThe observed risk in the treated group is $r_{1}^{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{3}{7}$, which is significantly higher than the true risk of $r_{1} = 0.2$.\n\nFor the control group ($g=0$):\n$$\nr_{0}^{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{s_{0,1} r_0}{s_{0,1} r_0 + s_{0,0}(1-r_0)} = \\frac{(0.9)(0.3)}{(0.9)(0.3) + (0.9)(1-0.3)} = \\frac{0.9 \\times 0.3}{0.9 \\times (0.3 + 0.7)} = \\frac{0.3}{1.0} = 0.3\n$$\nAs expected, since the follow-up probability in the control group is independent of the outcome ($s_{0,1} = s_{0,0}$), the observed risk is unbiased: $r_{0}^{\\text{obs}} = r_{0} = 0.3$.\n\nNow we compute the naive risk ratio:\n$$\n\\text{RR}^{\\text{naive}} = \\frac{r_{1}^{\\text{obs}}}{r_{0}^{\\text{obs}}} = \\frac{3/7}{0.3} = \\frac{3/7}{3/10} = \\frac{3}{7} \\times \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{10}{7}\n$$\nNumerically, $\\frac{10}{7} \\approx 1.4285714...$. Rounding to four significant figures, we get $1.429$.\nThe naive risk ratio is greater than $1$, suggesting the treatment is harmful. This confirms the reversal of the association, from a true protective effect ($\\text{RR}^{\\text{true}} \\approx 0.67$) to an apparent harmful effect ($\\text{RR}^{\\text{naive}} \\approx 1.43$) due to differential loss to follow-up.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.429}$$", "id": "4609103"}, {"introduction": "To effectively combat bias, we must first be able to quantify it.

The region where $RR > 1$ is characterized by $p_{1u} > \\frac{2}{3}p_{0u} - \\frac{7}{60}$. The region where $RR \\leq 1$ is characterized by $p_{1u} \\leq \\frac{2}{3}p_{0u} - \\frac{7}{60}$.\n\nFor the worked example, we are asked to find the threshold value of $p_{1u}$ when $p_{0u}$ is fixed at $0.20$. We use the derived boundary equation:\n$$p_{1u} = \\frac{2}{3}(0.20) - \\frac{7}{60}$$\nSubstituting $0.20 = \\frac{1}{5}$:\n$$p_{1u} = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{7}{60} = \\frac{2}{15} - \\frac{7}{60}$$\nTo subtract the fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $60$:\n$$p_{1u} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 4}{15 \\cdot 4} - \\frac{7}{60} = \\frac{8}{60} - \\frac{7}{60} = \\frac{1}{60}$$\nThe problem requires this answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$p_{1u} = \\frac{1}{60} = 0.016666...$$\nRounding to four significant figures yields $0.01667$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.01667}$$", "id": "4609079"}]}
