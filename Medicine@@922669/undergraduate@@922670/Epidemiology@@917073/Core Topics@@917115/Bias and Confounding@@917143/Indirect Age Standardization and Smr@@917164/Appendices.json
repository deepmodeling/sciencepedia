The first significant figure is the $7$ in the fourth decimal place. The four significant figures are $7$, $5$, $7$, $5$. The fifth significant figure is $9$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant figure from $5$ to $6$.\n$$\\Delta_{SMR, rounded} = 0.0007576$$\nThis result demonstrates the sensitivity of the $SMR$ to the precision of the input rates, an important consideration in epidemiological analysis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0007576}$$", "id": "4601219"}, {"introduction": "Once you have mastered the calculation of an SMR, the next critical step is understanding what the resulting number truly means.

The term $N_a r_a^{std}$ in the denominator represents the expected number of deaths in stratum $a$ of the study population, had it experienced the mortality rate of the standard population. The sum $\\sum_{a=1}^{4} N_a r_a^{std}$ is thus the total number of expected deaths in the study population under the standard population's rates. Therefore, the MLE is the ratio of total observed deaths to total expected deaths, which is the definition of the SMR.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\hat{\\theta}$ using the provided data.\nFirst, we calculate the total observed deaths, $O_{total}$:\n$$\nO_{total} = \\sum_{a=1}^{4} O_a = 30 + 50 + 160 + 210 = 450\n$$\nNext, we calculate the expected number of deaths for each stratum, $E_a = N_a r_a^{std}$:\n-   $E_1 = N_1 r_1^{std} = 50000 \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-4}) = 25$\n-   $E_2 = N_2 r_2^{std} = 30000 \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-3}) = 60$\n-   $E_3 = N_3 r_3^{std} = 15000 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-2}) = 150$\n-   $E_4 = N_4 r_4^{std} = 5000 \\times (4.0 \\times 10^{-2}) = 200$\n\nThen, we calculate the total expected deaths, $E_{total}$:\n$$\nE_{total} = \\sum_{a=1}^{4} E_a = 25 + 60 + 150 + 200 = 435\n$$\nFinally, we compute the MLE, $\\hat{\\theta}$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\theta} = \\frac{O_{total}}{E_{total}} = \\frac{450}{435}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{\\theta} \\approx 1.03448275...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$\n\\hat{\\theta} \\approx 1.034\n$$\nThis value suggests that the mortality in the study city is approximately $3.4\\%$ higher than what would be expected if it had the same age-specific mortality rates as the standard population.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1.034} $$", "id": "4601154"}]}
