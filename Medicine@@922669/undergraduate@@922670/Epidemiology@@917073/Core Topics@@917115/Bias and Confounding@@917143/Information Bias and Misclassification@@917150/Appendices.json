It is well-posed, asking for a specific algebraic derivation for which a unique solution exists under well-defined conditions. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and consistent. No flaws are identified. The problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The derivation of the solution follows.\n\nThe primary objective is to express the observed prevalence, $\\hat{p} = P(W=1)$, in terms of the true prevalence, $p$, and the test characteristics, $Se$ and $Sp$. We can achieve this by applying the law of total probability. The sample space can be partitioned by the true status of the condition, i.e., into the disjoint events $\\{X=1\\}$ (condition present) and $\\{X=0\\}$ (condition absent).\n\nAccording to the law of total probability, the probability of any event (in this case, $W=1$) can be expressed as the sum of its conditional probabilities over a partition of the sample space:\n$$P(W=1) = P(W=1 \\mid X=1)P(X=1) + P(W=1 \\mid X=0)P(X=0)$$\n\nWe can substitute the given definitions into this equation.\n-   $P(W=1)$ is the observed prevalence, $\\hat{p}$.\n-   $P(W=1 \\mid X=1)$ is the sensitivity, $Se$.\n-   $P(X=1)$ is the true prevalence, $p$.\n\nThe term $P(X=0)$ is the probability that the condition is absent. Since the true status $X$ is binary, we have:\n$$P(X=0) = 1 - P(X=1) = 1 - p$$\n\nThe term $P(W=1 \\mid X=0)$ is the probability of a positive test result given that the condition is truly absent. This is the false positive rate. It is not directly provided but can be derived from the specificity, $Sp$. The specificity is $Sp = P(W=0 \\mid X=0)$. Since the test result $W$ is binary, for a given true status $X=0$, the sum of probabilities of all possible outcomes must be $1$:\n$$P(W=1 \\mid X=0) + P(W=0 \\mid X=0) = 1$$\nSolving for the false positive rate gives:\n$$P(W=1 \\mid X=0) = 1 - P(W=0 \\mid X=0) = 1 - Sp$$\n\nNow we substitute all these components back into the law of total probability equation:\n$$\\hat{p} = (Se)(p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)$$\n\nThis equation is the functional relationship linking the observed prevalence $\\hat{p}$, the true prevalence $p$, the sensitivity $Se$, and the specificity $Sp$. This completes the first part of the task.\n\nThe second part of the task is to algebraically solve for $p$. We begin with the derived relationship:\n$$\\hat{p} = Se \\cdot p + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)$$\nFirst, distribute the term $(1 - Sp)$:\n$$\\hat{p} = Se \\cdot p + 1 - p - Sp + Sp \\cdot p$$\nNext, we group all terms containing $p$ on one side of the equation and all other terms on the other side.\n$$\\hat{p} - 1 + Sp = Se \\cdot p - p + Sp \\cdot p$$\nFactor out $p$ from the terms on the right-hand side:\n$$\\hat{p} + Sp - 1 = p(Se - 1 + Sp)$$\nFinally, to isolate $p$, we divide both sides by the coefficient of $p$, which is $(Se + Sp - 1)$. This is valid provided that $Se + Sp - 1 \\neq 0$. The condition $Se + Sp = 1$ implies that the test is non-informative, equivalent to guessing, and in such a case, the true prevalence cannot be determined from the observed prevalence.\n$$p = \\frac{\\hat{p} + Sp - 1}{Se + Sp - 1}$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the true prevalence $p$ in terms of the observed prevalence $\\hat{p}$, sensitivity $Se$, and specificity $Sp$. This relationship is known as the Rogan-Gladen estimator.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\hat{p} + Sp - 1}{Se + Sp - 1}}$$", "id": "4602781"}, {"introduction": "While sensitivity and specificity describe a test's intrinsic accuracy, their real-world utility depends on the context in which the test is used.
