It provides all necessary information to compute the observed Relative Risk under conditions of non-differential outcome misclassification.\n\nThe objective is to compute the observed Relative Risk, denoted as $RR^{*}$, which is defined as the ratio of the observed risk of the outcome in the exposed group to the observed risk in the unexposed group. The observed outcome is denoted by $Y^{*}$, while the true outcome is $Y$. The exposure is $X$. The observed Relative Risk is given by the formula:\n$$RR^{*} = \\frac{P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid X=1)}{P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid X=0)}$$\n\nWe are given the following information:\nThe true risk in the exposed group: $P(Y=1 \\mid X=1) = 0.20$.\nThe true risk in the unexposed group: $P(Y=1 \\mid X=0) = 0.10$.\nFrom these, we can also determine the probability of not having the true outcome:\n$P(Y=0 \\mid X=1) = 1 - P(Y=1 \\mid X=1) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\n$P(Y=0 \\mid X=0) = 1 - P(Y=1 \\mid X=0) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\n\nThe outcome classification is imperfect, characterized by:\nSensitivity: $Se_{Y} = P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid Y=1) = 0.80$.\nSpecificity: $Sp_{Y} = P(Y^{*}=0 \\mid Y=0) = 0.90$.\n\nFrom the specificity, we can determine the probability of a false positive classification:\n$P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid Y=0) = 1 - P(Y^{*}=0 \\mid Y=0) = 1 - Sp_{Y} = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n\nThe problem states that the outcome misclassification is non-differential, which means that the sensitivity and specificity of the outcome measurement do not depend on the exposure status $X$. That is, $P(Y^{*} \\mid Y, X=1) = P(Y^{*} \\mid Y, X=0) = P(Y^{*} \\mid Y)$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator of $RR^{*}$, the observed risk in the exposed group, $P(Y^{*}=1 \\mid X=1)$.

The true Relative Risk was $RR = 0.20 / 0.10 = 2$.
