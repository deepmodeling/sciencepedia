The cohort is stratified by $Z$, and the following $2 \\times 2$ tables (counts of cases and non-cases) are observed:\n\nFor $Z=0$ (low baseline risk):\n- Exposed: $a_{0} = 5$ cases, $b_{0} = 95$ non-cases, total $N_{E0} = 100$.\n- Unexposed: $c_{0} = 90$ cases, $d_{0} = 810$ non-cases, total $N_{U0} = 900$.\n- Stratum total: $N_{0} = 1000$.\n\nFor $Z=1$ (high baseline risk):\n- Exposed: $a_{1} = 180$ cases, $b_{1} = 720$ non-cases, total $N_{E1} = 900$.\n- Unexposed: $c_{1} = 40$ cases, $d_{1} = 60$ non-cases, total $N_{U1} = 100$.\n- Stratum total: $N_{1} = 1000$.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of risk and of the risk ratio, and the standard epidemiologic definition of confounding and effect modification, do the following:\n- Verify the stratum-specific effect of $E$ on $Y$ within each level of $Z$.\n- Compute the crude (unstratified) risk ratio of $E$ versus no $E$.\n- Compute the Mantel–Haenszel (MH) pooled risk ratio across the two strata defined by $Z$.\n- Based on formal definitions, state whether $Z$ acts as a confounder, an effect modifier, both, or neither in this study, and explain why the crude and pooled estimates differ, noting any manifestation of Simpson’s paradox.\n\nProvide your single final numeric answer as the Mantel–Haenszel pooled risk ratio for the effect of $E$ on $Y$.

We are given count data for an exposure $E$, an outcome $Y$, and a potential confounding/modifying variable $Z$. The analysis will proceed by calculating stratum-specific, crude, and pooled measures of association.\n\nFirst, we define the fundamental quantities. The risk of the outcome $Y$ in a given group is the proportion of individuals in that group who experience the outcome. The risk ratio ($RR$) is the ratio of the risk in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group.\n\n$R = \\frac{\\text{number of cases}}{\\text{total number of individuals}}$\n$RR = \\frac{\\text{Risk in Exposed}}{\\text{Risk in Unexposed}}$\n\nLet us denote the risk in the exposed group within stratum $i$ as $R_{Ei}$ and in the unexposed group as $R_{Ui}$. The stratum-specific risk ratio is $RR_i = R_{Ei} / R_{Ui}$. The variable $i$ will take values $0$ for the low-risk stratum ($Z=0$) and $1$ for the high-risk stratum ($Z=1$).\n\n1.  **Stratum-Specific Analysis**\n\nFor the stratum $Z=0$ (low baseline risk):\nThe number of cases in the exposed group is $a_0=5$, and the total number of exposed individuals is $N_{E0}=100$. The risk in the exposed is:\n$$R_{E0} = \\frac{a_0}{N_{E0}} = \\frac{5}{100} = 0.05$$\nThe number of cases in the unexposed group is $c_0=90$, and the total number of unexposed individuals is $N_{U0}=900$. The risk in the unexposed is:\n$$R_{U0} = \\frac{c_0}{N_{U0}} = \\frac{90}{900} = 0.10$$\nThe stratum-specific risk ratio for $Z=0$ is:\n$$RR_0 = \\frac{R_{E0}}{R_{U0}} = \\frac{0.05}{0.10} = 0.5$$\n\nFor the stratum $Z=1$ (high baseline risk):\nThe number of cases in the exposed group is $a_1=180$, and the total number of exposed individuals is $N_{E1}=900$. The risk in the exposed is:\n$$R_{E1} = \\frac{a_1}{N_{E1}} = \\frac{180}{900} = 0.20$$\nThe number of cases in the unexposed group is $c_1=40$, and the total number of unexposed individuals is $N_{U1}=100$. The risk in the unexposed is:\n$$R_{U1} = \\frac{c_1}{N_{U1}} = \\frac{40}{100} = 0.40$$\nThe stratum-specific risk ratio for $Z=1$ is:\n$$RR_1 = \\frac{R_{E1}}{R_{U1}} = \\frac{0.20}{0.40} = 0.5$$\n\n2.  **Assessment of Effect Modification**\n\nEffect modification (or interaction) is present if the measure of association between exposure and outcome differs across strata of a third variable. Here, the measure of association is the risk ratio. We compare the stratum-specific risk ratios:\n$$RR_0 = 0.5 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad RR_1 = 0.5$$\nSince $RR_0 = RR_1$, the effect of exposure $E$ on outcome $Y$ is homogeneous across the strata of $Z$. Therefore, $Z$ is **not an effect modifier**. The exposure is consistently protective, reducing the risk of the outcome by $50\\%$ in both low-risk and high-risk individuals.\n\n3.  **Crude (Unstratified) Analysis**\n\nTo compute the crude risk ratio, we first collapse the two strata into a single $2 \\times 2$ table.\n- Total exposed cases: $a_{crude} = a_0 + a_1 = 5 + 180 = 185$\n- Total exposed non-cases: $b_{crude} = b_0 + b_1 = 95 + 720 = 815$\n- Total exposed: $N_{E, crude} = a_{crude} + b_{crude} = 185 + 815 = 1000$\n\n- Total unexposed cases: $c_{crude} = c_0 + c_1 = 90 + 40 = 130$\n- Total unexposed non-cases: $d_{crude} = d_0 + d_1 = 810 + 60 = 870$\n- Total unexposed: $N_{U, crude} = c_{crude} + d_{crude} = 130 + 870 = 1000$\n\nThe crude risk in the exposed group is:\n$$R_{E, crude} = \\frac{a_{crude}}{N_{E, crude}} = \\frac{185}{1000} = 0.185$$\nThe crude risk in the unexposed group is:\n$$R_{U, crude} = \\frac{c_{crude}}{N_{U, crude}} = \\frac{130}{1000} = 0.130$$\nThe crude risk ratio is:\n$$RR_{crude} = \\frac{R_{E, crude}}{R_{U, crude}} = \\frac{0.185}{0.130} \\approx 1.423$$\n\n4.  **Assessment of Confounding**\n\nA variable $Z$ is a confounder if it is associated with both the exposure $E$ and the outcome $Y$ (independent of $E$), and it is not on the causal pathway. A key sign of confounding is when the crude measure of association differs from the adjusted (stratum-specific) measure of association.\n- Crude risk ratio: $RR_{crude} \\approx 1.423$\n- Stratum-specific risk ratios: $RR_0 = RR_1 = 0.5$\nSince $1.423 \\neq 0.5$, confounding is present. The variable $Z$ is a **confounder**.\n\nThe confounding arises because:\n- $Z$ is associated with the outcome $Y$: The baseline risk of $Y$ is much higher in the $Z=1$ stratum ($R_{U1}=0.40$) than in the $Z=0$ stratum ($R_{U0}=0.10$).\n- $Z$ is associated with the exposure $E$: The high-risk group ($Z=1$) was much more likely to be exposed ($P(E|Z=1) = 900/1000 = 0.9$) than the low-risk group ($P(E|Z=0) = 100/1000 = 0.1$). This is a case of \"confounding by indication,\" where the prophylactic exposure is preferentially given to those at higher perceived risk.\n\nThe crude analysis incorrectly suggests that the exposure is harmful ($RR > 1$), while the stratified analysis reveals the exposure is protective ($RR < 1$). This reversal of the direction of association upon stratification is a classic example of **Simpson's paradox**. The crude estimate is biased because it disproportionately compares a high-risk exposed group to a low-risk unexposed group.\n\n5.  **Mantel–Haenszel (MH) Pooled Risk Ratio**\n\nSince there is no effect modification, it is appropriate to compute a single summary measure of association that adjusts for the confounding by $Z$. The Mantel–Haenszel pooled risk ratio ($RR_{MH}$) is a weighted average of the stratum-specific risk ratios. The formula is:\n$$RR_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{1} \\frac{a_i (c_i+d_i)}{N_i}}{\\sum_{i=0}^{1} \\frac{c_i (a_i+b_i)}{N_i}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{1} \\frac{a_i N_{Ui}}{N_i}}{\\sum_{i=0}^{1} \\frac{c_i N_{Ei}}{N_i}}$$\nwhere $N_i$ is the total size of stratum $i$.\n\nNumerator calculation:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = \\frac{a_0 N_{U0}}{N_0} + \\frac{a_1 N_{U1}}{N_1} = \\frac{5 \\times 900}{1000} + \\frac{180 \\times 100}{1000} = 4.5 + 18 = 22.5 $$\n\nDenominator calculation:\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = \\frac{c_0 N_{E0}}{N_0} + \\frac{c_1 N_{E1}}{N_1} = \\frac{90 \\times 100}{1000} + \\frac{40 \\times 900}{1000} = 9 + 36 = 45 $$\n\nThe Mantel–Haenszel pooled risk ratio is:\n$$ RR_{MH} = \\frac{22.5}{45} = 0.5 $$\nAs expected, because the stratum-specific risk ratios are identical, the pooled estimate is equal to their common value. This adjusted estimate represents the true, unconfounded effect of exposure $E$ on outcome $Y$.\n\nFinal conclusion: $Z$ acts as a confounder but not an effect modifier. The crude risk ratio of approximately $1.423$ is spurious and an artifact of confounding, manifesting as Simpson's paradox. The adjusted risk ratio, correctly estimated by the Mantel-Haenszel procedure as $0.5$, shows a strong protective effect of the exposure.\nThe final numeric answer requested is the Mantel–Haenszel pooled risk ratio.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5}$$", "id": "4588683"}, {"introduction": "This practice explores a crucial but often misunderstood aspect of effect modification: its dependence on the chosen scale of measurement.

The problem provides the following stratum-specific risks:\nFor stratum $Z=0$:\n-   Risk for the unexposed ($E=0$): $p_{00} = 0.12$\n-   Risk for the exposed ($E=1$): $p_{10} = 0.06$\n\nFor stratum $Z=1$:\n-   Risk for the unexposed ($E=0$): $p_{01} = 0.04$\n-   Risk for the exposed ($E=1$): $p_{11} = 0.02$\n\nThe measure of association on the additive scale is the risk difference ($RD$). The stratum-specific risk difference, $RD_z$, is the difference in risk between the exposed and unexposed groups within a specific stratum $z$. It is calculated as:\n$$RD_z = p_{1z} - p_{0z}$$\n\nWe calculate the risk difference for each stratum of $Z$.\n\nFor stratum $Z=0$:\n$$RD_0 = p_{10} - p_{00} = 0.06 - 0.12 = -0.06$$\nThis indicates a protective effect of the exposure in the $Z=0$ stratum, with the risk being $0.06$ lower among the exposed compared to the unexposed.\n\nFor stratum $Z=1$:\n$$RD_1 = p_{11} - p_{01} = 0.02 - 0.04 = -0.02$$\nThis also indicates a protective effect of the exposure in the $Z=1$ stratum, with the risk being $0.02$ lower among the exposed compared to the unexposed.\n\nEffect modification on the additive scale is present if the risk difference varies across strata of the third variable $Z$, i.e., if $RD_0 \\neq RD_1$. The problem explicitly defines the quantity to be derived as \"the difference in stratum-specific risk differences between $Z=1$ and $Z=0$\".

The fact that this value is non-zero ($0.04 \\neq 0$) confirms the presence of effect modification. The positive sign indicates that the risk difference is less negative (i.e., the protective effect is smaller) in the $Z=1$ stratum compared to the $Z=0$ stratum.

The cohort is stratified by $M$ with equal numbers of vaccinated ($E=1$) and unvaccinated ($E=0$) participants per stratum. For each stratum, you are given counts for $Y$ and for a Negative Control Outcome (NCO) $Y^{NC}$ measured in the calendar quarter immediately preceding vaccination. By design, $Y^{NC}$ cannot be causally affected by $E$, but it is anticipated to share sources of confounding with $Y$ (for example, baseline health-seeking behavior $U$ and frailty).\n\nData:\n\n- Younger adults ($M=0$):\n  - Winter mortality $Y$: among $N=10{,}000$ vaccinated, $30$ deaths; among $N=10{,}000$ unvaccinated, $60$ deaths.\n  - Pre-vaccination NCO $Y^{NC}$ (non-infectious hospitalization in the prior quarter): among $N=10{,}000$ vaccinated, $600$ events; among $N=10{,}000$ unvaccinated, $1{,}000$ events.\n\n- Older adults ($M=1$):\n  - Winter mortality $Y$: among $N=10{,}000$ vaccinated, $200$ deaths; among $N=10{,}000$ unvaccinated, $180$ deaths.\n  - Pre-vaccination NCO $Y^{NC}$: among $N=10{,}000$ vaccinated, $950$ events; among $N=10{,}000$ unvaccinated, $1{,}000$ events.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions from epidemiology (such as confounding, effect modification, and the roles of Negative Control Outcome and Negative Control Exposure) and without assuming any particular parametric model, interpret the pattern of associations. Which option most appropriately distinguishes confounding from effect modification and specifies a valid way to further probe confounding using negative controls?\n\nA. The data provide strong evidence for true effect modification by age: the vaccine causally reduces mortality only in younger adults. The NCO results are irrelevant because they occur before vaccination and thus cannot inform bias.\n\nB. The data suggest differential confounding by age (stronger in younger adults), making the apparent stronger protective association in younger at least partly due to confounding rather than pure effect modification. A valid follow-up is to use a Negative Control Exposure $E^{NC}$ (for example, receipt of a tetanus booster in the same season) that should not causally affect winter mortality but shares health-seeking confounding; if $E^{NC}$ shows a similar association with $Y$, confounding is implicated.\n\nC. The observed associations are best explained by exposure misclassification in younger adults, and the NCO associations conclusively exclude confounding because they precede vaccination.\n\nD. Stratifying by age introduces collider bias because age is affected by both vaccination and mortality; negative controls cannot detect collider bias here, so the younger stratum result must be causal.", "solution": "This problem requires a careful interpretation of observational data using the principle of a Negative Control Outcome (NCO) to distinguish true effect modification from confounding. The NCO is an outcome ($Y^{NC}$) that occurs before the exposure ($E$) and thus cannot be caused by it. Any association between $E$ and $Y^{NC}$ must therefore be due to confounding.\n\nLet's calculate the Risk Ratios ($RR$) for both the primary outcome (mortality, $Y$) and the NCO ($Y^{NC}$) in each age stratum.\n\n**1. Analysis for Younger Adults ($M=0$):**\n- **Mortality ($Y$):** The risk among vaccinated is $30/10{,}000 = 0.003$, and among unvaccinated is $60/10{,}000 = 0.006$. The observed risk ratio is $RR_{Y, M=0} = 0.003 / 0.006 = 0.5$. This suggests a strong protective association.\n- **Negative Control Outcome ($Y^{NC}$):** The risk among vaccinated is $600/10{,}000 = 0.06$, and among unvaccinated is $1{,}000/10{,}000 = 0.10$. The risk ratio for the NCO is $RR_{Y^{NC}, M=0} = 0.06 / 0.10 = 0.6$.\n\nSince the NCO cannot be caused by the vaccine, the strong association ($RR=0.6$) is clear evidence of confounding. This \"healthy user bias\" means that younger adults who choose to get vaccinated are already healthier (or have different health behaviors) than those who do not. This confounding creates a spurious protective association, meaning the observed $RR_Y$ of $0.5$ is likely biased and exaggerates any true protective effect.\n\n**2. Analysis for Older Adults ($M=1$):**\n- **Mortality ($Y$):** The risk among vaccinated is $200/10{,}000 = 0.020$, and among unvaccinated is $180/10{,}000 = 0.018$. The observed risk ratio is $RR_{Y, M=1} = 0.020 / 0.018 \\approx 1.11$. This suggests no protective effect.\n- **Negative Control Outcome ($Y^{NC}$):** The risk among vaccinated is $950/10{,}000 = 0.095$, and among unvaccinated is $1{,}000/10{,}000 = 0.10$. The risk ratio for the NCO is $RR_{Y^{NC}, M=1} = 0.095 / 0.10 = 0.95$.\n\nIn this stratum, the NCO association is very close to the null ($RR=1$), indicating that there is very little confounding from healthy user bias among older adults.\n\n**3. Synthesis:**\nThe naive interpretation is effect modification by age: the vaccine appears protective in the young but not in the old. However, the NCO analysis reveals that the magnitude of confounding also differs dramatically by age: it is strong in the younger group and weak in the older group. This phenomenon is called **differential confounding**. It means the apparent effect modification is likely an artifact of this differential bias, not a true difference in the vaccine's causal effect.\n\n**4. Evaluating Options:**\n- **A:** Incorrect. It ignores the NCO data, which is crucial for detecting confounding.\n- **B:** Correct. It correctly identifies differential confounding and proposes a valid follow-up analysis using a Negative Control Exposure ($E^{NC}$), which is an exposure (like a tetanus booster) that shares confounding sources with the flu vaccine but does not affect winter mortality. Finding an association between the $E^{NC}$ and mortality would further confirm the presence of confounding.\n- **C:** Incorrect. It misinterprets the role of the NCO and brings up misclassification without evidence.\n- **D:** Incorrect. Age is a potential confounder, not a collider. Stratifying is the correct first step to analyze its role.\n\nTherefore, the data pattern strongly suggests that differential confounding is masquerading as effect modification.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4588703"}]}
