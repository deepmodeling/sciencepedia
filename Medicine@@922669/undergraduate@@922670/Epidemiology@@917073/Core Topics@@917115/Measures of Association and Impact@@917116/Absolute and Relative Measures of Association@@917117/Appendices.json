It is a standard problem in introductory epidemiology and biostatistics. Therefore, a full solution is warranted.\n\n### Part 1: First Principles, Definitions, and Confidence Interval Construction\n\nFrom first principles, **risk** is defined as the probability of a new event (e.g., disease onset) occurring within a specified time period among a population of individuals who are at risk at the beginning of the period.\n\nLet $R_1$ be the risk in the exposed group (solvent-exposed workers) and $R_0$ be the risk in the unexposed group. The point estimates for these risks, denoted $\\hat{R}_1$ and $\\hat{R}_0$, are calculated from the sample data:\n-   $a = 128$ is the number of incident cases in the exposed group.\n-   $n_1 = 6400$ is the total number of individuals in the exposed group.\n-   $c = 60$ is the number of incident cases in the unexposed group.\n-   $n_0 = 4800$ is the total number of individuals in the unexposed group.\n\nThe estimated risk in the exposed group is:\n$$ \\hat{R}_1 = \\frac{a}{n_1} $$\nThe estimated risk in the unexposed group is:\n$$ \\hat{R}_0 = \\frac{c}{n_0} $$\nThe **risk ratio (RR)** is a relative measure of association that compares the risk in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group. It is defined as:\n$$ RR = \\frac{R_1}{R_0} $$\nThe point estimate for the risk ratio, $\\widehat{RR}$, is calculated using the sample estimates of the risks:\n$$ \\widehat{RR} = \\frac{\\hat{R}_1}{\\hat{R}_0} = \\frac{a/n_1}{c/n_0} $$\nFor large samples, the sampling distribution of $\\widehat{RR}$ is skewed. However, the sampling distribution of the natural logarithm of the risk ratio, $\\ln(\\widehat{RR})$, is approximately normal. We therefore construct the confidence interval on the log scale and then transform the limits back to the original scale by exponentiation.\n\nThe variance of $\\ln(\\widehat{RR})$ is derived from the variances of the individual risk estimates using the delta method. For a cohort study, the estimated variance of $\\ln(\\widehat{RR})$ is given by:\n$$ \\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\frac{1-\\hat{R}_1}{a} + \\frac{1-\\hat{R}_0}{c} = \\frac{1 - a/n_1}{a} + \\frac{1-c/n_0}{c} $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{c} - \\frac{1}{n_0} $$\nThe standard error, $\\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}))$, is the square root of the variance:\n$$ \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{c} - \\frac{1}{n_0}} $$\nA $(1-\\alpha) \\times 100\\%$ confidence interval (CI) for $\\ln(RR)$ is constructed as:\n$$ \\ln(\\widehat{RR}) \\pm Z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\times \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) $$\nFor a $95\\%$ CI, $\\alpha=0.05$, and the critical value from the standard normal distribution is $Z_{1-0.05/2} = Z_{0.975} \\approx 1.96$.\n\nThe limits for the $95\\%$ CI of $\\ln(RR)$ are:\n-   Lower Limit $(\\ln)$: $L_{\\ln} = \\ln(\\widehat{RR}) - 1.96 \\times \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}))$\n-   Upper Limit $(\\ln)$: $U_{\\ln} = \\ln(\\widehat{RR}) + 1.96 \\times \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}))$\n\nTo obtain the $95\\%$ CI for the risk ratio $RR$, we exponentiate these limits:\n-   Lower Confidence Limit (LCL): $LCL = \\exp(L_{\\ln}) = \\exp\\left( \\ln(\\widehat{RR}) - 1.96 \\times \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) \\right) = \\widehat{RR} \\times \\exp\\left( -1.96 \\times \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) \\right)$\n-   Upper Confidence Limit (UCL): $UCL = \\exp(U_{\\ln}) = \\exp\\left( \\ln(\\widehat{RR}) + 1.96 \\times \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) \\right) = \\widehat{RR} \\times \\exp\\left( 1.96 \\times \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) \\right)$\n\n### Part 2: Explanation of Log-Scale Transformation and Symmetry\n\nThe use of the natural logarithm scale for constructing the confidence interval is crucial for ratio measures like the RR. The confidence interval on the log scale, $[\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) - E, \\ln(\\widehat{RR}) + E]$ where $E = 1.96 \\times \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}))$, is symmetric by construction. The margin of error, $E$, is added to and subtracted from the point estimate $\\ln(\\widehat{RR})$.\n\nWhen we transform this interval back to the original risk ratio scale by exponentiation, the limits become $[\\exp(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) - E), \\exp(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) + E)]$. Using the properties of exponential functions, this interval is $[\\widehat{RR} \\cdot e^{-E}, \\widehat{RR} \\cdot e^{E}]$, which can be written as $[\\widehat{RR} / e^E, \\widehat{RR} \\cdot e^E]$.\n\nOn the original scale, this interval is not arithmetically symmetric around $\\widehat{RR}$. The distance from the point estimate to the upper limit is $\\widehat{RR} \\cdot e^E - \\widehat{RR} = \\widehat{RR}(e^E - 1)$, while the distance from the point estimate to the lower limit is $\\widehat{RR} - \\widehat{RR} \\cdot e^{-E} = \\widehat{RR}(1 - e^{-E})$. Since $e^E - 1 \\neq 1 - e^{-E}$ for any $E > 0$, the interval is arithmetically asymmetric.\n\nHowever, the interval is symmetric on a multiplicative (or ratio) scale. The upper limit is obtained by multiplying the point estimate by a factor of $e^E$, and the lower limit is obtained by dividing the point estimate by the same factor, $e^E$. That is:\n$$ \\frac{UCL}{\\widehat{RR}} = e^E \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\widehat{RR}}{LCL} = e^E $$\nThis multiplicative symmetry is conceptually appropriate for a ratio measure, as it implies that the uncertainty is proportional to the magnitude of the estimate. Furthermore, this structure ensures that the confidence interval for a risk ratio (which must be non-negative) will never include negative values. The point estimate $\\widehat{RR}$ is the geometric mean of the confidence limits, $\\widehat{RR} = \\sqrt{LCL \\times UCL}$, not the arithmetic mean.\n\n### Numerical Computations\n\nGiven the data: $a=128$, $n_1=6400$, $c=60$, $n_0=4800$.\n\n1.  **Calculate Risk Estimates:**\n    $$ \\hat{R}_1 = \\frac{128}{6400} = 0.02 $$\n    $$ \\hat{R}_0 = \\frac{60}{4800} = 0.0125 $$\n\n2.  **Calculate Point Estimate of RR:**\n    $$ \\widehat{RR} = \\frac{0.02}{0.0125} = 1.6 $$\n\n3.  **Calculate Standard Error of $\\ln(\\widehat{RR})$:**\n    $$ \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{128} - \\frac{1}{6400} + \\frac{1}{60} - \\frac{1}{4800}} $$\n    $$ \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\sqrt{0.0078125 - 0.00015625 + 0.0166666\\overline{6} - 0.0002083\\overline{3}} $$\n    $$ \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\sqrt{0.00765625 + 0.0164583\\overline{3}} $$\n    $$ \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\sqrt{0.02411458\\overline{3}} \\approx 0.155288706 $$\n\n4.  **Construct 95% CI on Log Scale:**\n    $$ \\ln(\\widehat{RR}) = \\ln(1.6) \\approx 0.470003629 $$\n    Margin of error $E = 1.96 \\times 0.155288706 \\approx 0.304365864$.\n    $$ L_{\\ln} = 0.470003629 - 0.304365864 = 0.165637765 $$\n    $$ U_{\\ln} = 0.470003629 + 0.304365864 = 0.774369493 $$\n\n5.  **Transform CI to Original Scale:**\n    $$ LCL = \\exp(0.165637765) \\approx 1.180145 $$\n    $$ UCL = \\exp(0.774369493) \\approx 2.169190 $$\n\n6.  **Round to Four Significant Figures:**\n    -   Risk Ratio ($\\widehat{RR}$): $1.600$\n    -   Lower Confidence Limit (LCL): $1.180$\n    -   Upper Confidence Limit (UCL): $2.169$\n\nThe final result is a risk ratio of $1.600$ with a $95\\%$ confidence interval of ($1.180$, $2.169$).

Definitions**\n- The risk of an outcome is the proportion of individuals in a group who experience the outcome. For a group of size $n$ with $k$ cases, the risk is $R = k/n$.\n- The Risk Ratio ($RR$) is the ratio of the risk in the exposed group ($R_1$) to the risk in the unexposed group ($R_0$):\n  $$RR = \\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{P(Y=1|E=1)}{P(Y=1|E=0)}$$\n\n**2. Stratum-Specific Risk Ratios**\n\n- **For Stratum $S=H$ (High Risk):**\n  - Risk in exposed ($E=1$): $R_{1H} = \\frac{180}{900} = 0.20$.\n  - Risk in unexposed ($E=0$): $R_{0H} = \\frac{40}{100} = 0.40$.\n  - Stratum-specific Risk Ratio:\n    $$RR_H = \\frac{R_{1H}}{R_{0H}} = \\frac{0.20}{0.40} = 0.50$$\n\n- **For Stratum $S=L$ (Low Risk):**\n  - Risk in exposed ($E=1$): $R_{1L} = \\frac{5}{100} = 0.05$.\n  - Risk in unexposed ($E=0$): $R_{0L} = \\frac{90}{900} = 0.10$.\n  - Stratum-specific Risk Ratio:\n    $$RR_L = \\frac{R_{1L}}{R_{0L}} = \\frac{0.05}{0.10} = 0.50$$\n\nWithin each stratum, the exposure appears to be protective, reducing the risk by $50\\%$. The stratum-specific risk ratios are homogeneous (equal), with $RR_H = RR_L = 0.50$.\n\n**3. Marginal (Crude) Risk Ratio**\n\nTo calculate the crude $RR$, we must first pool the data from both strata.\n\n- **Total Exposed Group ($E=1$):**\n  - Total subjects: $n_1 = n_{1H} + n_{1L} = 900 + 100 = 1000$.\n  - Total cases: $a = a_H + a_L = 180 + 5 = 185$.\n  - Marginal risk in exposed: $R_1 = \\frac{a}{n_1} = \\frac{185}{1000} = 0.185$.\n\n- **Total Unexposed Group ($E=0$):**\n  - Total subjects: $n_0 = n_{0H} + n_{0L} = 100 + 900 = 1000$.\n  - Total cases: $c = c_H + c_L = 40 + 90 = 130$.\n  - Marginal risk in unexposed: $R_0 = \\frac{c}{n_0} = \\frac{130}{1000} = 0.130$.\n\n- **Crude Risk Ratio:**\n  $$RR_{crude} = \\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{0.185}{0.130} \\approx 1.42307...$$\nThe crude $RR$ is approximately $1.42$.\n\n**4. Interpretation: Confounding vs. Non-collapsibility**\n\nWe observe a reversal of association: the stratum-specific RRs are $0.50$ (protective), while the crude RR is $\\approx 1.42$ (harmful). This phenomenon is known as **Simpson's Paradox**. The task is to determine whether this is due to confounding or non-collapsibility.\n\n- **Confounding:** A variable $S$ is a confounder if it is associated with both the exposure $E$ and the outcome $Y$ (independent of $E$), and is not on the causal pathway from $E$ to $Y$.\n  - **Association between $S$ and $E$**:\n    - Proportion exposed in stratum $H$: $P(E=1|S=H) = \\frac{900}{900+100} = \\frac{900}{1000} = 0.9$.\n    - Proportion exposed in stratum $L$: $P(E=1|S=L) = \\frac{100}{100+900} = \\frac{100}{1000} = 0.1$.\n    - Since $P(E=1|S=H) \\neq P(E=1|S=L)$, $S$ is strongly associated with $E$.\n  - **Association between $S$ and $Y$ (among the unexposed)**:\n    - Risk in stratum $H$ (unexposed): $P(Y=1|S=H, E=0) = \\frac{40}{100} = 0.4$.\n    - Risk in stratum $L$ (unexposed): $P(Y=1|S=L, E=0) = \\frac{90}{900} = 0.1$.\n    - Since $P(Y=1|S=H, E=0) \\neq P(Y=1|S=L, E=0)$, $S$ is a risk factor for $Y$.\n  - The variable $S$ is a baseline risk factor, so it is not on the causal pathway.\n  - Since all conditions are met, **$S$ is a confounder**. The crude (marginal) association is distorted because the exposed group is disproportionately composed of high-risk individuals ($90\\%$ of exposed are in stratum $H$) while the unexposed group is disproportionately composed of low-risk individuals ($90\\%$ of unexposed are in stratum $L$). This creates a spurious harmful association in the crude analysis.\n\n- **Collapsibility:** This is a mathematical property of an effect measure. A measure is collapsible if the crude measure is a weighted average of the stratum-specific measures. More formally, a measure is collapsible if, for a constant stratum-specific measure, the crude measure will equal that common value if and only if the stratifying variable is not associated with the exposure.\n  - The **Risk Ratio ($RR$) is a collapsible measure**. When the stratum-specific RRs are constant (as they are here: $0.50$), any difference between this common value and the crude RR must be due to confounding (i.e., an association between the stratification variable and the exposure).\n  - The **Odds Ratio ($OR$) is non-collapsible**. For the OR, the crude measure can differ from a common stratum-specific measure even in the absence of confounding, simply as a mathematical consequence of the measure's non-linearity.\n\nIn this problem, the measure is the Risk Ratio. Because the RR is collapsible, the observed discrepancy between the adjusted ($0.50$) and crude ($\\approx 1.42$) values is entirely attributable to the confounding by $S$. It is not an issue of non-collapsibility.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **A. The stratum-specific $RR$s are each $0.50$, while the crude $RR$ is approximately $1.42$; this is Simpson’s paradox driven by confounding by $S$, not by non-collapsibility.**\n  - Our calculations confirm the stratum-specific $RR$s are $0.50$ and the crude $RR$ is $\\approx 1.42$.\n  - The reversal of effect direction is indeed Simpson's paradox.\n  - Our analysis shows that $S$ is a strong confounder.\n  - The discrepancy is due to confounding because the Risk Ratio is a collapsible measure. The statement that it is *not* by non-collapsibility is correct.\n  - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. The stratum-specific $RR$s are each $0.50$, while the crude $RR$ is approximately $1.42$; this occurs because the risk ratio is non-collapsible.**\n  - The numerical values are correct.\n  - The interpretation is incorrect. The risk ratio is collapsible, not non-collapsible. The phenomenon is caused by confounding.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. The stratum-specific and crude $RR$s are all equal (approximately $0.50$); there is no Simpson’s paradox and no confounding.**\n  - This is factually incorrect. Our calculation shows the crude $RR$ is $\\approx 1.42$, which is not equal to $0.50$.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. The stratum-specific $RR$s exceed $1$ in both strata, but the crude $RR$ is less than $1$; this reversal is due to confounding by $S$.**\n  - This states the numerical pattern in reverse. The stratum-specific $RR$s are $0.50$ (less than $1$) and the crude $RR$ is $\\approx 1.42$ (greater than $1$).\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **E. A reversal of direction for the risk ratio cannot occur; such reversals only occur for the odds ratio, so the pattern described is impossible for the risk ratio.**\n  - This is a false claim. Simpson's paradox, including a full reversal of the direction of association, can occur for the risk ratio, risk difference, and odds ratio. We have just demonstrated it for the risk ratio.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4570002"}]}
