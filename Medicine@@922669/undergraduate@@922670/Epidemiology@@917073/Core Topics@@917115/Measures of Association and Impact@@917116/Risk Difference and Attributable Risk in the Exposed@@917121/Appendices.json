A complete solution is warranted.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution proceeds by following the steps outlined in the problem statement, starting from fundamental definitions.\n\n1.  **Incidence Rate Calculation**\nThe incidence rate, also known as incidence density or hazard rate in this context, measures the rate at which new cases occur in a population at risk over time. For a dynamic cohort with variable follow-up, it is calculated as the number of incident cases ($D$) divided by the total person-time at risk ($PT$). Let $\\lambda$ denote the incidence rate.\n\nFor the exposed group, the incidence rate $\\lambda_E$ is:\n$$ \\lambda_E = \\frac{D_E}{PT_E} = \\frac{207}{4{,}150} \\text{ cases per person-year} $$\nFor the unexposed group, the incidence rate $\\lambda_U$ is:\n$$ \\lambda_U = \\frac{D_U}{PT_U} = \\frac{154}{5{,}500} \\text{ cases per person-year} $$\nNumerically, these are:\n$$ \\lambda_E \\approx 0.0498795 \\text{ cases per person-year} $$\n$$ \\lambda_U = 0.028 \\text{ cases per person-year} $$\n\n2.  **Relating Incidence Rate to Cumulative Incidence**\nThe problem specifies that the hazard rate is constant over time within each group. Let the constant hazard rate be $\\lambda$. The survival function, $S(t)$, which is the probability of an individual remaining free of the condition until at least time $t$, is related to the hazard rate by the equation:\n$$ S(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^t \\lambda(u) \\, du\\right) $$\nGiven that the hazard is constant, $\\lambda(u) = \\lambda$, the integral simplifies to:\n$$ \\int_0^t \\lambda \\, du = \\lambda t $$\nThus, the survival function becomes:\n$$ S(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t) $$\nThe cumulative incidence, $CI(t)$, is the probability of an individual developing the condition by time $t$. It is the complement of the survival function:\n$$ CI(t) = 1 - S(t) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $S(t)$, we obtain the formula relating cumulative incidence to a constant incidence rate:\n$$ CI(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t) $$\nWe apply this formula to calculate the $3$-year cumulative incidence for both the exposed and unexposed groups, setting $t=3$ years.\n\nFor the exposed group:\n$$ CI_E(3) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_E \\times 3) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{207}{4{,}150} \\times 3\\right) $$\nFor the unexposed group:\n$$ CI_U(3) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_U \\times 3) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{154}{5{,}500} \\times 3\\right) $$\n\n3.  **Risk Difference and Attributable Risk in the Exposed**\nThe risk difference ($RD$) at a given time $t$ is the absolute difference in risk (cumulative incidence) between the exposed and unexposed groups.\n$$ RD(t) = CI_E(t) - CI_U(t) $$\nUnder a causal framework, this risk difference is interpreted as the attributable risk in the exposed ($AR_E$). It represents the excess risk in the exposed group that is due to the exposure itself.\n$$ AR_E(t) = CI_E(t) - CI_U(t) $$\nWe are asked to calculate this for $t=3$ years:\n$$ AR_E(3) = CI_E(3) - CI_U(3) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for cumulative incidence:\n$$ AR_E(3) = \\left[1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_E \\times 3)\\right] - \\left[1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_U \\times 3)\\right] $$\n$$ AR_E(3) = \\exp(-\\lambda_U \\times 3) - \\exp(-\\lambda_E \\times 3) $$\nNow we substitute the numerical values for the rates:\n$$ \\lambda_E = \\frac{207}{4{,}150} $$\n$$ \\lambda_U = \\frac{154}{5{,}500} = 0.028 $$\nThe exponents are:\n$$ \\lambda_E \\times 3 = \\frac{207 \\times 3}{4{,}150} = \\frac{621}{4{,}150} \\approx 0.14963855 $$\n$$ \\lambda_U \\times 3 = 0.028 \\times 3 = 0.084 $$\nNow, we calculate the attributable risk in the exposed at $3$ years:\n$$ AR_E(3) = \\exp(-0.084) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{621}{4{,}150}\\right) $$\n$$ AR_E(3) \\approx 0.91942416 - 0.86101902 $$\n$$ AR_E(3) \\approx 0.05840514 $$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$ AR_E(3) \\approx 0.05841 $$\nThis value represents the excess risk of developing the chronic condition over a $3$-year period for workers in the exposed group that is attributable to the solvent exposure. It implies that for every $10{,}000$ exposed workers, approximately $584$ excess cases over $3$ years are attributable to the exposure, compared to a similar group of unexposed workers.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.05841}\n$$", "id": "4631898"}, {"introduction": "A crucial skill for any scientist is not just performing calculations, but also critically evaluating analyses performed by others.

Cumulative incidence (risk) by time $t$, denoted $CI(t)$, is the probability that a disease-free individual experiences the event by time $t$; it is estimated by appropriately handling censoring to align the time horizon across groups.

The risk difference at a common time $t$ is $RD(t) = CI_E(t) - CI_U(t)$, where $CI_E(t)$ and $CI_U(t)$ denote risks in exposed and unexposed, respectively. The Attributable Fraction among the Exposed (AFE) is the proportion of risk among the exposed that is attributable to exposure, defined as $AFE(t) = \\dfrac{CI_E(t) - CI_U(t)}{CI_E(t)}$.\n\nPrincipled computation requires comparing the same time horizon and properly accounting for censoring. The analyst’s simple proportions $x_E/n_E$ and $x_U/n_U$ ignore the fact that average follow-up differs ($1.6$ versus $1.9$ years), so the numerators reflect different amounts of time at risk.

The attributable fraction in the exposed ($AF_e$) represents the proportion of cases in the exposed group that can be attributed to the exposure itself. Its formula, using standardized risks, is:\n$$AF_{e,std} = \\frac{R_{std, e} - R_{std, u}}{R_{std, e}}$$\nwhere $R_{std, e}$ is the age-standardized cumulative incidence risk in the exposed and $R_{std, u}$ is the age-standardized cumulative incidence risk in the unexposed.\n\nLet us denote the two age strata as $i=1$ for age $<50$ and $i=2$ for age $\\ge 50$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the stratum-specific cumulative incidence risks ($R$) for both the exposed ($e$) and unexposed ($u$) groups. The cumulative incidence risk is the proportion of individuals who develop the outcome.\n\nFor the exposed group:\n- Risk in stratum $1$ ($R_{e,1}$): $R_{e,1} = \\frac{24}{300} = 0.08$\n- Risk in stratum $2$ ($R_{e,2}$): $R_{e,2} = \\frac{40}{200} = 0.20$\n\nFor the unexposed group:\n- Risk in stratum $1$ ($R_{u,1}$): $R_{u,1} = \\frac{30}{500} = 0.06$\n- Risk in stratum $2$ ($R_{u,2}$): $R_{u,2} = \\frac{36}{400} = 0.09$\n\nNext, we perform direct standardization. The problem specifies using the age distribution of the exposed population as the standard. We determine the weights ($w_i$) for each stratum from this standard population.\n- Population in stratum $1$ of the standard (exposed) population: $N_{std,1} = 300$\n- Population in stratum $2$ of the standard (exposed) population: $N_{std,2} = 200$\n- Total standard population: $N_{std} = N_{std,1} + N_{std,2} = 300 + 200 = 500$\n\nThe weights for each stratum are the proportion of the standard population in that stratum:\n- Weight for stratum $1$ ($w_1$): $w_1 = \\frac{N_{std,1}}{N_{std}} = \\frac{300}{500} = 0.6$\n- Weight for stratum $2$ ($w_2$): $w_2 = \\frac{N_{std,2}}{N_{std}} = \\frac{200}{500} = 0.4$\n\nNow we calculate the age-standardized risks for the exposed and unexposed groups by taking the weighted average of the stratum-specific risks.\n\nThe standardized risk for the exposed ($R_{std, e}$) is:\n$$R_{std, e} = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} w_i R_{e,i} = w_1 R_{e,1} + w_2 R_{e,2}$$\n$$R_{std, e} = (0.6)(0.08) + (0.4)(0.20) = 0.048 + 0.080 = 0.128$$\nNote that since the standard population is the exposed population itself, the standardized risk for the exposed is identical to the crude risk for the exposed: $\\frac{24+40}{300+200} = \\frac{64}{500} = 0.128$.\n\nThe standardized risk for the unexposed ($R_{std, u}$) represents the counterfactual risk that would have been observed in the standard population had they been unexposed:\n$$R_{std, u} = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} w_i R_{u,i} = w_1 R_{u,1} + w_2 R_{u,2}$$\n$$R_{std, u} = (0.6)(0.06) + (0.4)(0.09) = 0.036 + 0.036 = 0.072$$\n\nWith the standardized risks, we can now calculate the standardized risk difference ($RD_{std}$), which is the excess risk due to exposure after controlling for age.\n$$RD_{std} = R_{std, e} - R_{std, u} = 0.128 - 0.072 = 0.056$$\n\nFinally, we compute the attributable fraction in the exposed ($AF_{e,std}$) by dividing the standardized risk difference by the standardized risk in the exposed.\n$$AF_{e,std} = \\frac{RD_{std}}{R_{std, e}} = \\frac{0.056}{0.128}$$\n$$AF_{e,std} = \\frac{56}{128} = \\frac{7}{16} = 0.4375$$\nThe result $0.4375$ has exactly four significant figures.
