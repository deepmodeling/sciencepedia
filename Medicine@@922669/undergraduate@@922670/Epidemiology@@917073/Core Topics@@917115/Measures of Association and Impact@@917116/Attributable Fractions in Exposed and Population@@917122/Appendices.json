Let $R$ denote the cumulative incidence (risk) of disease over the fixed follow-up period, with $R_e$ the risk among the exposed and $R_u$ the risk among the unexposed. The observed data show $R_e = 0.20$ and $R_u = 0.10$. The attributable fraction in the exposed (AF_e) is the proportion of cases among the exposed that would not have occurred during the study period if the exposure had been eliminated, under the assumptions of exchangeability and a well-defined exposure. The risk ratio (RR) is the ratio of risks $R_e$ to $R_u$, and the risk difference (RD) is the absolute difference in risks.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of risk, and the conceptual definition of the attributable fraction in the exposed as the proportion of exposed cases that are due to the exposure, derive from first principles an expression for $AF_e$, compute its numerical value using the given $R_e$ and $R_u$, interpret the result in words, and express $AF_e$ in terms of the risk ratio ($RR$) and the risk difference ($RD$).

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of epidemiology, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and phrased objectively. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation from first principles of the attributable fraction in the exposed, $AF_e$, its computation, interpretation, and its expression in terms of other standard epidemiological measures.\n\n1.  **Derivation of the Expression for $AF_e$**\n\nThe attributable fraction in the exposed, $AF_e$, is conceptually defined as the proportion of incident cases in the exposed group that are attributable to the exposure itself. To formalize this, we rely on the counterfactual framework and the assumption of exchangeability. This assumption posits that, had the exposed group not been exposed, their risk of disease would have been equal to the risk observed in the unexposed group, $R_u$.\n\nLet $R_e$ be the risk of disease in the exposed group. This is the total observed incidence from all causes.\nLet $R_u$ be the risk of disease in the unexposed group. Under the assumption of exchangeability, $R_u$ represents the \"background\" or \"baseline\" risk that would exist in any group, regardless of exposure status.\n\nThe risk in the exposed group, $R_e$, can thus be seen as the sum of two components:\n-   The background risk that would have occurred even without the exposure, which is equal to $R_u$.\n-   The excess risk that is specifically due to the exposure. This quantity is the risk difference, $RD = R_e - R_u$.\n\nThe problem asks for the *proportion* of cases among the exposed that are attributable to the exposure. This is the ratio of the excess risk to the total risk in the exposed group.\n\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\nAF_e = \\frac{\\text{Risk due to exposure}}{\\text{Total risk in the exposed}}\n$$\nSubstituting the corresponding quantities:\n$$\nAF_e = \\frac{R_e - R_u}{R_e}\n$$\nThis expression is the formal definition of the attributable fraction in the exposed, derived directly from its conceptual meaning.\n\n2.  **Numerical Calculation of $AF_e$**\n\nThe problem provides the following values for the cumulative incidences (risks):\n-   Risk in the exposed, $R_e = 0.20$\n-   Risk in the unexposed, $R_u = 0.10$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula for $AF_e$:\n$$\nAF_e = \\frac{0.20 - 0.10}{0.20} = \\frac{0.10}{0.20} = 0.5\n$$\n\n3.  **Interpretation of the Result**\n\nAn $AF_e$ value of $0.5$, or $50\\%$, carries a specific meaning in the context of this study. It means that among the university students who frequently use electronic cigarettes, we can attribute $50\\%$ of the acute bronchitis cases to their e-cigarette use. Phrased from a public health perspective, assuming the observed association is causal and all assumptions hold, eliminating frequent e-cigarette use in this student population would have prevented $50\\%$ of the bronchitis cases that occurred in the exposed group during the one-year follow-up period.\n\n4.  **Expressing $AF_e$ in Terms of Risk Ratio ($RR$) and Risk Difference ($RD$)**\n\nThe problem also requires expressing $AF_e$ in terms of the risk ratio ($RR$) and the risk difference ($RD$).\n\nThe definitions given are:\n-   Risk Ratio: $RR = \\frac{R_e}{R_u}$\n-   Risk Difference: $RD = R_e - R_u$\n\n**Expression in terms of $RR$**:\nWe start with the derived formula for $AF_e$:\n$$\nAF_e = \\frac{R_e - R_u}{R_e}\n$$\nWe can rewrite this expression by dividing both terms in the numerator by the denominator:\n$$\nAF_e = \\frac{R_e}{R_e} - \\frac{R_u}{R_e} = 1 - \\frac{R_u}{R_e}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{R_u}{R_e}$ is the reciprocal of the risk ratio, $RR$. That is, $\\frac{1}{RR} = \\frac{R_u}{R_e}$.\nSubstituting this relationship into the equation for $AF_e$:\n$$\nAF_e = 1 - \\frac{1}{RR}\n$$\nThis can also be written as a single fraction:\n$$\nAF_e = \\frac{RR - 1}{RR}\n$$\n\n**Expression in terms of $RD$**:\nWe again start with the derived formula for $AF_e$:\n$$\nAF_e = \\frac{R_e - R_u}{R_e}\n$$\nThe numerator, $R_e - R_u$, is by definition the risk difference, $RD$.\nTherefore, we can directly substitute $RD$ into the numerator:\n$$\nAF_e = \\frac{RD}{R_e}\n$$\nThis expression relates $AF_e$ to the risk difference, but it is not expressed purely in terms of $RD$, as it also requires the value of the risk in the exposed, $R_e$. An expression for $AF_e$ purely in terms of $RR$ and $RD$ is not possible, as it would reduce back to the expression involving only $RR$. The two formulas derived, $AF_e = \\frac{RR-1}{RR}$ and $AF_e = \\frac{RD}{R_e}$, are the standard forms relating $AF_e$ to these other measures of association and impact.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5}$$", "id": "4572150"}, {"introduction": "While the $AF_e$ is critical, public health officials must consider the impact on the entire community, not just the exposed. This requires accounting for both the strength of the association and the prevalence of the exposure in the population.

Let $I_{e}$ denote the incidence among the exposed, $I_{u}$ denote the incidence among the unexposed, and $I$ denote the overall incidence in the source population.

The number of exposed cases is $p_{\\text{cases}} \\times C$.\n\nThe Attributable Fraction among the exposed ($AF_e$) is the proportion of cases in the exposed group that can be attributed to the exposure. It is defined as:\n$$AF_e = \\frac{I_{e} - I_{u}}{I_{e}}$$\nThe number of attributable cases among the exposed is the total number of exposed cases multiplied by $AF_e$, which is $(p_{\\text{cases}} \\times C) \\times AF_e$.\n\nThe Population Attributable Fraction ($PAF$) is the proportion of *all* cases in the population that are attributable to the exposure.
