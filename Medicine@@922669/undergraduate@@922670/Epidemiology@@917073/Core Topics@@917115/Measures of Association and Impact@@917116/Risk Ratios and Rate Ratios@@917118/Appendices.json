The data provided are complete and consistent, the objective is clearly stated, and the underlying statistical model (independent binomial sampling) is scientifically sound and appropriate for the context. The task requires a first-principles derivation and calculation, which is a standard exercise in biostatistical theory.\n\nThe derivation and calculation proceed as follows.\n\n**1. Definition of Parameters and Estimators**\n\nLet $R_1$ be the true risk (cumulative incidence) of the respiratory condition in the exposed group, and $R_0$ be the true risk in the unexposed group. The problem states that the study follows a closed cohort design. The number of incident cases in each group can be modeled by a binomial distribution.\n\n- In the exposed group, the number of cases, $a$, is a random variable following $a \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n_1, R_1)$.\n- In the unexposed group, the number of cases, $c$, is a random variable following $c \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n_0, R_0)$.\n\nThe maximum likelihood estimators for the risks are the sample proportions:\n- Estimator for $R_1$: $\\widehat{R}_1 = \\frac{a}{n_1}$\n- Estimator for $R_0$: $\\widehat{R}_0 = \\frac{c}{n_0}$\n\nThe parameter of interest is the risk ratio, $RR = \\frac{R_1}{R_0}$. Its point estimate is given by $\\widehat{RR} = \\frac{\\widehat{R}_1}{\\widehat{R}_0}$.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Confidence Interval**\n\nWe seek a confidence interval for $RR$. The distribution of $\\widehat{RR}$ is skewed, but the distribution of its logarithm, $\\ln(\\widehat{RR})$, is more closely approximated by a normal distribution for large samples. Therefore, we first construct a confidence interval for $\\ln(RR)$ and then back-transform it.\n\nThe logarithm of the estimated risk ratio is:\n$$ \\ln(\\widehat{RR}) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\widehat{R}_1}{\\widehat{R}_0}\\right) = \\ln(\\widehat{R}_1) - \\ln(\\widehat{R}_0) $$\nThe problem specifies that the sampling in the two groups is independent. Consequently, the estimators $\\widehat{R}_1$ and $\\widehat{R}_0$ are independent, and so are their transformations, $\\ln(\\widehat{R}_1)$ and $\\ln(\\widehat{R}_0)$. The variance of the difference is the sum of the variances:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\text{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{R}_1)) + \\text{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{R}_0)) $$\nTo find the variance of $\\ln(\\widehat{R}_i)$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, we use a first-order Taylor series expansion, also known as the Delta method. For a function $g(X)$ of a random variable $X$, the approximate variance is $\\text{Var}(g(X)) \\approx [g'(E(X))]^2 \\text{Var}(X)$.\n\nHere, the random variables are the estimators $\\widehat{R}_i$, and the function is $g(x) = \\ln(x)$. The derivative is $g'(x) = \\frac{1}{x}$. The expected value of the estimator is $E(\\widehat{R}_i) = R_i$. The variance of the estimator is derived from the binomial model: $\\text{Var}(\\widehat{R}_i) = \\text{Var}(\\frac{\\text{cases}_i}{n_i}) = \\frac{1}{n_i^2} \\text{Var}(\\text{cases}_i) = \\frac{1}{n_i^2} [n_i R_i (1-R_i)] = \\frac{R_i(1-R_i)}{n_i}$.\n\nApplying the Delta method to $\\ln(\\widehat{R}_1)$:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{R}_1)) \\approx \\left[ \\frac{d}{dR_1} \\ln(R_1) \\right]^2 \\text{Var}(\\widehat{R}_1) = \\left(\\frac{1}{R_1}\\right)^2 \\frac{R_1(1-R_1)}{n_1} = \\frac{1-R_1}{n_1 R_1} $$\nSimilarly, for the unexposed group:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{R}_0)) \\approx \\frac{1-R_0}{n_0 R_0} $$\nSumming these gives the variance of the log risk ratio:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) \\approx \\frac{1-R_1}{n_1 R_1} + \\frac{1-R_0}{n_0 R_0} $$\nTo use this for a confidence interval, we need an estimated variance, which is obtained by substituting the estimated risks $\\widehat{R}_1 = a/n_1$ and $\\widehat{R}_0 = c/n_0$ for the true risks $R_1$ and $R_0$:\n$$ \\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\frac{1-\\widehat{R}_1}{n_1 \\widehat{R}_1} + \\frac{1-\\widehat{R}_0}{n_0 \\widehat{R}_0} = \\frac{1-a/n_1}{n_1(a/n_1)} + \\frac{1-c/n_0}{n_0(c/n_0)} = \\frac{(n_1-a)/n_1}{a} + \\frac{(n_0-c)/n_0}{c} $$\n$$ \\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\frac{n_1-a}{n_1 a} + \\frac{n_0-c}{n_0 c} $$\nThis can be algebraically simplified to:\n$$ \\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\left(\\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{n_1}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{c} - \\frac{1}{n_0}\\right) $$\nThe standard error of the log risk ratio is the square root of this estimated variance:\n$$ \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{c} - \\frac{1}{n_0}} $$\nThe large-sample $(1-\\alpha) \\times 100\\%$ Wald confidence interval for $\\ln(RR)$ is:\n$$ \\ln(\\widehat{RR}) \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\times \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) $$\nwhere $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the $(1-\\alpha/2)$-quantile of the standard normal distribution. For a $95\\%$ confidence interval, $\\alpha=0.05$ and $z_{0.975} \\approx 1.96$.\n\nThe confidence interval for the risk ratio $RR$ is obtained by exponentiating the lower and upper limits of the interval for $\\ln(RR)$:\n$$ \\text{CI}_{1-\\alpha}(RR) = \\exp \\left[ \\ln(\\widehat{RR}) \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\times \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) \\right] $$\n$$ \\text{CI}_{1-\\alpha}(RR) = \\widehat{RR} \\times \\exp \\left[ \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\times \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) \\right] $$\n\n**3.

The units of these rates are events per person-year.\n\nThe problem states that the number of incident events in each group follows a Poisson process. The number of events observed in the exposed group, $E_1$, is a realization of a Poisson random variable $K_1$ with parameter $\\lambda_1 T_1$, where $T_1$ is the total person-time of observation. Similarly, the number of events in the unexposed group, $E_0$, is a realization of a Poisson random variable $K_0$ with parameter $\\lambda_0 T_0$.\nSo, we have:\n$$ K_1 \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_1 T_1) $$\n$$ K_0 \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_0 T_0) $$\nThe two processes are assumed to be independent.\n\nThe incidence rate in each group is estimated by the number of events divided by the person-time.

Crude Calculations\n\nTo compute the crude rates, we pool the event counts and person-time across both strata.\n- Total events in exposed group: $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 72 + 2 = 74$.\n- Total person-time in exposed group: $PT_{E,total} = PT_{E,1} + PT_{E,2} = 9000 + 1000 = 10000$ person-years.\n- Total events in unexposed group: $U_{total} = U_1 + U_2 = 10 + 27 = 37$.\n- Total person-time in unexposed group: $PT_{U,total} = PT_{U,1} + PT_{U,2} = 1000 + 9000 = 10000$ person-years.\n\nNow we compute the crude incidence rates and the crude IRR.\n- Crude incidence rate for the exposed: $IR_{E,crude} = \\frac{E_{total}}{PT_{E,total}} = \\frac{74}{10000} = 0.0074$ events per person-year.\n- Crude incidence rate for the unexposed: $IR_{U,crude} = \\frac{U_{total}}{PT_{U,total}} = \\frac{37}{10000} = 0.0037$ events per person-year.\n- Crude incidence rate ratio: $IRR_{crude} = \\frac{IR_{E,crude}}{IR_{U,crude}} = \\frac{0.0074}{0.0037} = 2.0$.\n\nThe crude $IRR$ is $2.0$, which suggests the exposure is a risk factor, a direct contradiction to the stratum-specific results. This reversal is an instance of Simpson's Paradox, caused by confounding.\n\n#### 3. Standardized Calculations (Direct Standardization)\n\nDirect standardization requires a standard population distribution. The problem specifies using the combined person-time distribution across strata as the standard. First, we calculate the total person-time in each stratum and the overall total person-time to find the weights.\n- Total person-time in Stratum $1$: $PT_1 = PT_{E,1} + PT_{U,1} = 9000 + 1000 = 10000$ person-years.\n- Total person-time in Stratum $2$: $PT_2 = PT_{E,2} + PT_{U,2} = 1000 + 9000 = 10000$ person-years.\n- Total person-time overall: $PT_{overall} = PT_1 + PT_2 = 10000 + 10000 = 20000$ person-years.\n\nThe weights for each stratum are the proportions of the total person-time.\n- Weight for Stratum $1$: $w_1 = \\frac{PT_1}{PT_{overall}} = \\frac{10000}{20000} = 0.5$.\n- Weight for Stratum $2$: $w_2 = \\frac{PT_2}{PT_{overall}} = \\frac{10000}{20000} = 0.5$.\n\nNext, we compute the standardized incidence rates for the exposed ($SIR_E$) and unexposed ($SIR_U$) groups by applying these weights to the stratum-specific rates.\n- Standardized incidence rate for the exposed:\n$$SIR_E = w_1 \\times IR_{E,1} + w_2 \\times IR_{E,2} = (0.5 \\times 0.008) + (0.5 \\times 0.002) = 0.004 + 0.001 = 0.005$$\n- Standardized incidence rate for the unexposed:\n$$SIR_U = w_1 \\times IR_{U,1} + w_2 \\times IR_{U,2} = (0.5 \\times 0.010) + (0.5 \\times 0.003) = 0.005 + 0.0015 = 0.0065$$\n\nFinally, the directly standardized incidence rate ratio ($sIRR$) is the ratio of these standardized rates.\n$$sIRR = \\frac{SIR_E}{SIR_U} = \\frac{0.005}{0.0065} = \\frac{50}{65} = \\frac{10}{13} \\approx 0.7692307...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the directly standardized IRR is $0.7692$. This value is less than $1$, which is consistent with the protective effect observed in the stratum-specific analyses.\n\n#### 4. Explanation of the Reversal\n\nThe reversal between the crude $IRR$ of $2.0$ (harmful) and the stratified $IRR$s of $0.8$ and $0.67$ (protective) arises from confounding by age stratum. The crude analysis is misleading because the exposed group disproportionately consists of older individuals ($90\\%$ of person-time in the older stratum is exposed) who have a higher baseline outcome rate, while the unexposed group is mostly younger individuals ($90\\%$ of person-time in the younger stratum is unexposed) with a lower baseline rate. The crude comparison incorrectly attributes the higher rate in the older group to the exposure itself, creating a spurious positive association.
