The odds of the outcome in the exposed group is $\\text{Odds}_1 = \\frac{p_1}{1-p_1}$. The odds of the outcome in the unexposed group is $\\text{Odds}_0 = \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0}$. The true odds ratio is $OR = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_1}{\\text{Odds}_0}$.\n\nThe sample estimates for the probabilities are $\\hat{p}_1 = \\frac{a}{a+b}$ and $\\hat{p}_0 = \\frac{c}{c+d}$.\nThe sample estimate for the odds in the exposed group is $\\hat{\\text{Odds}}_1 = \\frac{\\hat{p}_1}{1-\\hat{p}_1} = \\frac{a/(a+b)}{b/(a+b)} = \\frac{a}{b}$.\nThe sample estimate for the odds in the unexposed group is $\\hat{\\text{Odds}}_0 = \\frac{\\hat{p}_0}{1-\\hat{p}_0} = \\frac{c/(c+d)}{d/(c+d)} = \\frac{c}{d}$.\n\nThe sample odds ratio, $\\hat{OR}$, is the ratio of these sample odds:\n$$ \\hat{OR} = \\frac{\\hat{\\text{Odds}}_1}{\\hat{\\text{Odds}}_0} = \\frac{a/b}{c/d} = \\frac{ad}{bc} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\hat{OR} = \\frac{40 \\times 70}{60 \\times 30} = \\frac{2800}{1800} = \\frac{28}{18} = \\frac{14}{9} $$\n\n**Log Sample Odds Ratio ($\\log(\\hat{OR})$)**\n\nThe natural logarithm of the sample odds ratio is:\n$$ \\log(\\hat{OR}) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{9}\\right) $$\n\n**Derivation of the Standard Error for $\\log(\\hat{OR})$**\n\nWe derive the standard error for $\\log(\\hat{OR})$ from first principles using the Delta method, as specified. The large-sample distribution of $\\log(\\hat{OR})$ is approximately normal, which makes it suitable for constructing confidence intervals and performing hypothesis tests.\n\nThe parameter of interest is $\\log(OR) = \\log\\left(\\frac{p_1/(1-p_1)}{p_0/(1-p_0)}\\right) = \\text{logit}(p_1) - \\text{logit}(p_0)$. Its estimator is $\\log(\\hat{OR}) = \\text{logit}(\\hat{p}_1) - \\text{logit}(\\hat{p}_0)$.\n\nThe problem assumes independent binomial sampling for the two exposure strata. Let $n_1 = a+b$ and $n_0 = c+d$. The counts of individuals with the outcome, $a$ and $c$, are realizations of independent binomial random variables $A \\sim \\text{Bin}(n_1, p_1)$ and $C \\sim \\text{Bin}(n_0, p_0)$. The corresponding sample proportions are $\\hat{p}_1 = A/n_1$ and $\\hat{p}_0 = C/n_0$.\n\nDue to independence, the variance of the sample log odds ratio is the sum of the variances of the individual sample logits:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\log(\\hat{OR})) = \\text{Var}(\\text{logit}(\\hat{p}_1)) + \\text{Var}(\\text{logit}(\\hat{p}_0)) $$\nWe use the Delta method to find an approximation for $\\text{Var}(\\text{logit}(\\hat{p}))$. Let $g(p) = \\text{logit}(p) = \\ln\\left(p/(1-p)\\right)$. The derivative is $g'(p) = \\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{1-p} = \\frac{1}{p(1-p)}$.\n\nFor a large sample size $n$, the variance of $\\hat{p}$ is $\\text{Var}(\\hat{p}) = \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}$. The Delta method states that $\\text{Var}(g(\\hat{p})) \\approx [g'(\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{p}])]^2 \\text{Var}(\\hat{p})$. Since $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{p}] = p$, we have:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\text{logit}(\\hat{p})) \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{p(1-p)}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}\\right) = \\frac{1}{np(1-p)} $$\nApplying this result to both exposure groups:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\log(\\hat{OR})) \\approx \\frac{1}{n_1 p_1 (1-p_1)} + \\frac{1}{n_0 p_0 (1-p_0)} $$\nTo find the standard error, we estimate this variance by substituting the sample proportions for the true population proportions: $\\hat{p}_1 = a/n_1$, $1-\\hat{p}_1 = b/n_1$, $\\hat{p}_0 = c/n_0$, $1-\\hat{p}_0 = d/n_0$.\n$$ \\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\log(\\hat{OR})) = \\frac{1}{n_1 \\hat{p}_1 (1-\\hat{p}_1)} + \\frac{1}{n_0 \\hat{p}_0 (1-\\hat{p}_0)} = \\frac{1}{(a+b)\\left(\\frac{a}{a+b}\\right)\\left(\\frac{b}{a+b}\\right)} + \\frac{1}{(c+d)\\left(\\frac{c}{c+d}\\right)\\left(\\frac{d}{c+d}\\right)} $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ \\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\log(\\hat{OR})) = \\frac{a+b}{ab} + \\frac{c+d}{cd} = \\left(\\frac{a}{ab} + \\frac{b}{ab}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{c}{cd} + \\frac{d}{cd}\\right) = \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{d} + \\frac{1}{c} $$\nThe approximate standard error (SE) for $\\log(\\hat{OR})$ is the square root of this estimated variance:\n$$ \\text{SE}(\\log(\\hat{OR})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{d}} $$\nThis completes the derivation from first principles.\n\n**Wald $95\\%$ Confidence Interval and Hypothesis Test**\n\nThe $95\\%$ Wald CI for $\\log(OR)$ is given by $\\log(\\hat{OR}) \\pm z_{0.975} \\times \\text{SE}(\\log(\\hat{OR}))$, where $z_{0.975}$ is the $97.5$-th percentile of the standard normal distribution, approximately $1.96$. Exponentiating the endpoints of this interval would give the CI for the $OR$.\n\nThe hypothesis test is formulated as:\n- Null Hypothesis $H_0: OR = 1$, which is equivalent to $H_0: \\log(OR) = 0$.\n- Alternative Hypothesis $H_1: OR \\neq 1$, which is equivalent to $H_1: \\log(OR) \\neq 0$.\n\nThe Wald $z$ statistic is defined as the estimated parameter minus its hypothesized null value, divided by its standard error:\n$$ z = \\frac{\\log(\\hat{OR}) - \\log(1)}{\\text{SE}(\\log(\\hat{OR}))} = \\frac{\\log(\\hat{OR})}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{d}}} $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value for the $z$ statistic using the given cell counts.\n\nNumerator:\n$$ \\log(\\hat{OR}) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{9}\\right) $$\nDenominator (Standard Error):\n$$ \\text{SE}(\\log(\\hat{OR})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{40} + \\frac{1}{60} + \\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{1}{70}} $$\nWe find a common denominator for the fractions inside the square root. The least common multiple of $30$, $40$, $60$, and $70$ is $840$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{40} + \\frac{1}{60} + \\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{1}{70} = \\frac{21}{840} + \\frac{14}{840} + \\frac{28}{840} + \\frac{12}{840} = \\frac{21+14+28+12}{840} = \\frac{75}{840} = \\frac{5}{56} $$\nSo, the standard error is:\n$$ \\text{SE}(\\log(\\hat{OR})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{56}} $$\nThe $z$ statistic is:\n$$ z = \\frac{\\ln(14/9)}{\\sqrt{5/56}} $$\nNumerically:\n$$ \\ln(14/9) \\approx 0.441832798 $$\n$$ \\sqrt{5/56} \\approx \\sqrt{0.089285714} \\approx 0.298807155 $$\n$$ z \\approx \\frac{0.441832798}{0.298807155} \\approx 1.478651 $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we get $z = 1.479$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.479}$$", "id": "4616573"}, {"introduction": "In epidemiology, we must always be vigilant for confounding, where a third variable can distort the apparent association between an exposure and an outcome.

Therefore, the problem is **valid**.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Computation of Odds Ratios\n\n**Fundamental Definitions**\nIn a case-control study, the odds of an event (exposure) is the ratio of the number of individuals with the event to the number of individuals without the event.\nFor a given stratum $i$, the counts are:\n- $a_i$: exposed cases\n- $b_i$: unexposed cases\n- $c_i$: exposed controls\n- $d_i$: unexposed controls\n\nThe odds of exposure among cases is $Odds_{cases, i} = \\frac{a_i}{b_i}$.\nThe odds of exposure among controls is $Odds_{controls, i} = \\frac{c_i}{d_i}$.\nThe odds ratio ($OR$) is the ratio of these two odds:\n$$ OR_i = \\frac{Odds_{cases, i}}{Odds_{controls, i}} = \\frac{a_i / b_i}{c_i / d_i} = \\frac{a_i d_i}{b_i c_i} $$\n\n**1. Stratum-Specific Odds Ratios ($OR_1$ and $OR_2$)**\n\nUsing the formula above for each stratum:\n\nFor Stratum 1, with data $(20, 30; 10, 40)$:\n$a_1 = 20$, $b_1 = 30$, $c_1 = 10$, $d_1 = 40$.\nThe odds ratio for Stratum 1 is:\n$$ OR_1 = \\frac{a_1 d_1}{b_1 c_1} = \\frac{20 \\times 40}{30 \\times 10} = \\frac{800}{300} = \\frac{8}{3} \\approx 2.6666... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $OR_1 = 2.667$.\n\nFor Stratum 2, with data $(25, 35; 15, 25)$:\n$a_2 = 25$, $b_2 = 35$, $c_2 = 15$, $d_2 = 25$.\nThe odds ratio for Stratum 2 is:\n$$ OR_2 = \\frac{a_2 d_2}{b_2 c_2} = \\frac{25 \\times 25}{35 \\times 15} = \\frac{625}{525} = \\frac{25}{21} \\approx 1.19047... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $OR_2 = 1.190$.\n\n**2. Mantel-Haenszel (MH) Pooled Odds Ratio ($OR_{MH}$)**\n\nUnder the assumption that the true odds ratio is common across strata, the Mantel-Haenszel estimator provides a pooled odds ratio, adjusted for the stratifying variable. It is a weighted average of the stratum-specific odds ratios. The formula for the MH odds ratio is:\n$$ OR_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{a_i d_i}{n_i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{b_i c_i}{n_i}} $$\nwhere $k$ is the number of strata and $n_i = a_i + b_i + c_i + d_i$ is the total number of subjects in stratum $i$.\n\nFor Stratum 1:\n$n_1 = 20 + 30 + 10 + 40 = 100$.\nThe weight components are $\\frac{a_1 d_1}{n_1} = \\frac{20 \\times 40}{100} = 8$ and $\\frac{b_1 c_1}{n_1} = \\frac{30 \\times 10}{100} = 3$.\n\nFor Stratum 2:\n$n_2 = 25 + 35 + 15 + 25 = 100$.\nThe weight components are $\\frac{a_2 d_2}{n_2} = \\frac{25 \\times 25}{100} = 6.25$ and $\\frac{b_2 c_2}{n_2} = \\frac{35 \\times 15}{100} = 5.25$.\n\nNow, we compute the pooled estimator:\n$$ OR_{MH} = \\frac{\\frac{a_1 d_1}{n_1} + \\frac{a_2 d_2}{n_2}}{\\frac{b_1 c_1}{n_1} + \\frac{b_2 c_2}{n_2}} = \\frac{8 + 6.25}{3 + 5.25} = \\frac{14.25}{8.25} = \\frac{19}{11} \\approx 1.72727... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $OR_{MH} = 1.727$.\n\n**3. Crude Odds Ratio ($OR_{crude}$)**\n\nTo compute the crude odds ratio, we collapse the two strata into a single $2 \\times 2$ table by summing the counts from each cell.\n- Total exposed cases: $a_{crude} = a_1 + a_2 = 20 + 25 = 45$.\n- Total unexposed cases: $b_{crude} = b_1 + b_2 = 30 + 35 = 65$.\n- Total exposed controls: $c_{crude} = c_1 + c_2 = 10 + 15 = 25$.\n- Total unexposed controls: $d_{crude} = d_1 + d_2 = 40 + 25 = 65$.\n\nThe collapsed table is $(45, 65; 25, 65)$. The crude odds ratio is:\n$$ OR_{crude} = \\frac{a_{crude} d_{crude}}{b_{crude} c_{crude}} = \\frac{45 \\times 65}{65 \\times 25} = \\frac{45}{25} = \\frac{9}{5} = 1.8 $$\nExpressed to four significant figures, $OR_{crude} = 1.800$.\n\n### Step 3: Interpretation of Confounding\n\nThe key for interpreting confounding is to compare the crude measure of association with the adjusted (pooled) measure. Confounding is present if there is a meaningful difference between the crude odds ratio and the adjusted odds ratio.\n\n- Crude Odds Ratio: $OR_{crude} = 1.800$.\n- Adjusted (Mantel-Haenszel) Odds Ratio: $OR_{MH} = 1.727$.\n\nSince $OR_{crude} \\neq OR_{MH}$, the covariate is acting as a confounder. The crude odds ratio of $1.800$ is a biased estimate of the association between the exposure and the disease because it fails to account for the stratifying covariate. The Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio of $1.727$ is an adjusted estimate that controls for this confounding, and under the assumption of a common odds ratio, it provides a more valid summary of the true association. In this case, the confounding is positive, as the crude OR is slightly larger than the adjusted OR, suggesting the crude analysis overestimates the strength of the association.\n\nA confounder must be associated with both the exposure and the outcome. The data support this:\n1.  **Association with exposure:** The proportion of exposed individuals who are in Stratum 1 is $\\frac{a_1+c_1}{(a_1+c_1)+(a_2+c_2)} = \\frac{30}{30+40} \\approx 0.429$. The proportion of unexposed individuals who are in Stratum 1 is $\\frac{b_1+d_1}{(b_1+d_1)+(b_2+d_2)} = \\frac{70}{70+60} \\approx 0.538$. Since these proportions are different, the covariate is associated with the exposure.\n2.  **Association with outcome:** The proportion of cases who are in Stratum 1 is $\\frac{a_1+b_1}{(a_1+b_1)+(a_2+b_2)} = \\frac{50}{50+60} \\approx 0.455$. The proportion of controls who are in Stratum 1 is $\\frac{c_1+d_1}{(c_1+d_1)+(c_2+d_2)} = \\frac{50}{50+40} \\approx 0.556$. Since these proportions are different, the covariate is associated with the disease status.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the stratum-specific odds ratios ($OR_1 = 2.667$ and $OR_2 = 1.190$) are markedly different. This suggests the possibility of effect modification, meaning the strength of the association between exposure and disease differs across the strata of the covariate. While the problem instructed to assume a common odds ratio to calculate $OR_{MH}$, in a real-world analysis, this assumption would need to be formally tested (e.g., with a Breslow-Day test). If effect modification were confirmed, reporting stratum-specific odds ratios would be more appropriate than reporting a single pooled estimate. However, for the specific question of identifying confounding, the discrepancy between the crude ($1.800$) and adjusted ($1.727$) estimates is the definitive evidence.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 2.667  1.190  1.727  1.800 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4616565"}, {"introduction": "An odds ratio is a powerful measure of association, but its magnitude is not always easy to interpret, especially when communicating risk to a general audience.

We start with the definition of the $OR$ and solve for $p_1$.\n\nRearranging the $OR$ equation to isolate the term containing $p_1$:\n$$\\frac{p_1}{1 - p_1} = OR \\cdot \\frac{p_0}{1 - p_0}$$\n\nTo solve for $p_1$, let the right-hand side be represented by a constant $K$:\n$$K = OR \\cdot \\frac{p_0}{1 - p_0}$$\nSo, we have:\n$$\\frac{p_1}{1 - p_1} = K$$\n$$p_1 = K(1 - p_1)$$\n$$p_1 = K - K \\cdot p_1$$\n$$p_1 + K \\cdot p_1 = K$$\n$$p_1(1 + K) = K$$\n$$p_1 = \\frac{K}{1 + K}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $K$ back into the equation for $p_1$:\n$$p_1 = \\frac{OR \\cdot \\frac{p_0}{1 - p_0}}{1 + OR \\cdot \\frac{p_0}{1 - p_0}}$$\n\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $(1 - p_0)$:\n$$p_1 = \\frac{\\left(OR \\cdot \\frac{p_0}{1 - p_0}\\right) \\cdot (1 - p_0)}{\\left(1 + OR \\cdot \\frac{p_0}{1 - p_0}\\right) \\cdot (1 - p_0)}$$\n$$p_1 = \\frac{OR \\cdot p_0}{(1 - p_0) + OR \\cdot p_0}$$\n\nNow that we have an expression for $p_1$ in terms of $OR$ and $p_0$, we can derive the expression for $RR$ using its definition, $RR = p_1 / p_0$:\n$$RR = \\frac{\\frac{OR \\cdot p_0}{(1 - p_0) + OR \\cdot p_0}}{p_0}$$\n$$RR = \\frac{OR \\cdot p_0}{p_0 \\left( (1 - p_0) + OR \\cdot p_0 \\right)}$$\n\nAssuming $p_0 \\neq 0$ (which is required for a meaningful baseline risk and for $RR$ to be defined), we can cancel $p_0$ from the numerator and denominator:\n$$RR = \\frac{OR}{(1 - p_0) + OR \\cdot p_0}$$\nThis is the required expression for the risk ratio $RR$ in terms of the odds ratio $OR$ and the baseline risk $p_0$.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for the given values: $OR = 3$ and $p_0 = 0.2$.\n$$RR = \\frac{3}{(1 - 0.2) + (3 \\cdot 0.2)}$$\n$$RR = \\frac{3}{0.8 + 0.6}$$\n$$RR = \\frac{3}{1.4}$$\nTo express this as an exact fraction:\n$$RR = \\frac{3}{\\frac{14}{10}} = \\frac{3}{\\frac{7}{5}} = 3 \\cdot \\frac{5}{7} = \\frac{15}{7}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $OR/RR$ to quantify the overstatement of the risk ratio by the odds ratio in this specific scenario.\n$$ \\frac{OR}{RR} = \\frac{3}{\\frac{15}{7}} $$\n$$ \\frac{OR}{RR} = 3 \\cdot \\frac{7}{15} $$\n$$ \\frac{OR}{RR} = \\frac{21}{15} $$\nSimplifying the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $3$:\n$$ \\frac{OR}{RR} = \\frac{7}{5} $$\nAs a decimal, this is:\n$$ \\frac{OR}{RR} = 1.4 $$\nThis value is the final required result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.4}$$", "id": "4616586"}]}
