We are given that the outcome $Y$ and exposure $A$ are binary, $Y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ and $A \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. The risk of the outcome for a given exposure level $a$ and stratum $z$ is the conditional expectation $E[Y \\mid A=a, Z=z]$. For brevity, let's denote this as $R(a, z)$.\n\nStandardization is a method to compute a summary measure of association that would be observed in a target population if it had the same stratum-specific risks as the study population but the stratum distribution of the target population. In this problem, the target population is the overall study population itself, for which the distribution of $Z$ is given by the prevalences $P(Z=z)$.\n\nThe standardized risk for the exposed group ($A=1$), denoted $R_{1}^{\\text{std}}$, is the expected risk if the entire population were exposed. This is calculated by taking the weighted average of the stratum-specific risks among the exposed, $R(1, z)$, where the weights are the prevalences of the strata, $P(Z=z)$. This is a direct application of the law of total expectation, where we average the conditional expectations over the distribution of the conditioning variable:\n$$ R_{1}^{\\text{std}} = E_{\\text{std}}[Y \\mid A=1] = \\sum_{z} E[Y \\mid A=1, Z=z] P(Z=z) = \\sum_{z} R(1, z) P(Z=z) $$\n\nSimilarly, the standardized risk for the unexposed group ($A=0$), denoted $R_{0}^{\\text{std}}$, is the expected risk if the entire population were unexposed. This is the weighted average of the stratum-specific risks among the unexposed, $R(0, z)$:\n$$ R_{0}^{\\text{std}} = E_{\\text{std}}[Y \\mid A=0] = \\sum_{z} E[Y \\mid A=0, Z=z] P(Z=z) = \\sum_{z} R(0, z) P(Z=z) $$\n\nThe standardized population risk difference, which we denote as $\\text{SRD}$, is the difference between these two standardized risks:\n$$ \\text{SRD} = R_{1}^{\\text{std}} - R_{0}^{\\text{std}} $$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $R_{1}^{\\text{std}}$ and $R_{0}^{\\text{std}}$:\n$$ \\text{SRD} = \\left( \\sum_{z} R(1, z) P(Z=z) \\right) - \\left( \\sum_{z} R(0, z) P(Z=z) \\right) $$\n\nBy the linearity of summation, we can combine the two sums:\n$$ \\text{SRD} = \\sum_{z} \\left( R(1, z) P(Z=z) - R(0, z) P(Z=z) \\right) $$\nFactoring out the common term $P(Z=z)$:\n$$ \\text{SRD} = \\sum_{z} \\left( R(1, z) - R(0, z) \\right) P(Z=z) $$\n\nThe term inside the parentheses is precisely the definition of the stratum-specific risk difference provided in the problem statement: $\\text{RD}(z) = E[Y \\mid A=1, Z=z] - E[Y \\mid A=0, Z=z] = R(1, z) - R(0, z)$.\nTherefore, the final expression for the standardized risk difference is:\n$$ \\text{SRD} = \\sum_{z} \\text{RD}(z) P(Z=z) $$\nThis expression clarifies that the standardized population risk difference is a weighted average of the stratum-specific risk differences, where the weights are the prevalences of the respective strata in the target population (here, the overall population).\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of the Standardized Risk Difference\n\nWe now apply this derived formula to the provided data.

Age is a potential confounder with three strata: stratum $1$ ($18$–$34$ years), stratum $2$ ($35$–$54$ years), and stratum $3$ ($55$–$74$ years). Investigators report the following stratum-specific risks: in stratum $1$, exposed risk $=0.04$ and unexposed risk $=0.02$; in stratum $2$, exposed risk $=0.09$ and unexposed risk $=0.05$; in stratum $3$, exposed risk $=0.18$ and unexposed risk $=0.12$.

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data—stratum-specific risks and standard population weights—to compute the requested measure. The provided data are internally consistent (e.g., weights sum to $1$) and plausible. The language is objective and unambiguous. The inclusion of the internal population age distributions, while not required for the direct standardization calculation itself, serves to illustrate the presence of confounding, as the age structures of the exposed and unexposed groups differ substantially. This does not represent a contradiction but rather highlights the necessity of the specified analytical method. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to compute the age-standardized risk difference between the exposed and unexposed groups. Direct standardization achieves this by applying the stratum-specific risks observed in each study group to a single, common population structure, known as the standard population. This process yields age-adjusted risks for each group, which can then be compared without the confounding effect of age.\n\nThe directly standardized risk ($DSR$) for any group is calculated as the weighted average of its stratum-specific risks ($R_i$), where the weights ($w_i$) are the proportions of each stratum in the standard population. The formula is:\n$$\nDSR = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i R_i\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the number of strata. In this problem, $k=3$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the directly standardized risk for the exposed group ($DSR_E$). We use the stratum-specific risks for the exposed ($R_{Ei}$) and the standard population weights ($w_i$):\n$$\nDSR_E = w_1 R_{E1} + w_2 R_{E2} + w_3 R_{E3}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nDSR_E = (0.50)(0.04) + (0.30)(0.09) + (0.20)(0.18)\n$$\n$$\nDSR_E = 0.020 + 0.027 + 0.036\n$$\n$$\nDSR_E = 0.083\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the directly standardized risk for the unexposed group ($DSR_U$) using the same methodology but with the stratum-specific risks for the unexposed ($R_{Ui}$):\n$$\nDSR_U = w_1 R_{U1} + w_2 R_{U2} + w_3 R_{U3}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nDSR_U = (0.50)(0.02) + (0.30)(0.05) + (0.20)(0.12)\n$$\n$$\nDSR_U = 0.010 + 0.015 + 0.024\n$$\n$$\nDSR_U = 0.049\n$$\n\nThe directly standardized risk difference ($RD_{std}$) is the difference between these two standardized risks:\n$$\nRD_{std} = DSR_E - DSR_U\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $DSR_E$ and $DSR_U$:\n$$\nRD_{std} = 0.083 - 0.049 = 0.034\n$$\nThe result of the calculation is exactly $0.034$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The number $0.034$ has two significant figures (the digits $3$ and $4$).

This counterfactual risk is calculated by standardizing to the population's distribution of $B$.

Rounding to four significant figures gives $1.659$.\n\n### Step 3: Conceptual Explanation\n\nThe observation that $\\mathrm{PAF}_{A} + \\mathrm{PAF}_{B} \\approx 1.659 > 1$ does not violate any mathematical or probabilistic laws. This phenomenon arises from the synergistic interaction between exposures $A$ and $B$.\n\nA Population Attributable Fraction ($\\mathrm{PAF}$) is not a measure of the proportion of cases exclusively *caused* by an exposure, but rather the proportion of cases that would be *averted* if the exposure were removed from the population. The key to understanding the sum is to recognize that the sets of cases averted by eliminating $A$ and by eliminating $B$ are not mutually exclusive.\n\nThe data clearly demonstrates strong positive interaction (synergy) on the additive scale. The baseline risk (no exposures) is $r_{00}=0.01$. The risk added by $A$ alone is $r_{10} - r_{00} = 0.02 - 0.01 = 0.01$. The risk added by $B$ alone is $r_{01} - r_{00} = 0.02 - 0.01 = 0.01$. If the effects were simply additive, the risk with both exposures would be expected to be $r_{00} + (r_{10} - r_{00}) + (r_{01} - r_{00}) = 0.01 + 0.01 + 0.01 = 0.03$. However, the actual risk is $r_{11} = 0.20$, which is substantially higher. The excess risk, $r_{11} - (r_{10} + r_{01} - r_{00}) = 0.20 - (0.02 + 0.02 - 0.01) = 0.17$, is due to the synergistic interaction between $A$ and $B$.\n\nConsider the cases that occur only because both $A$ and $B$ are present—the \"interaction cases.\"\n- When we calculate $\\mathrm{PAF}_{A}$, we are calculating the proportion of cases that would be prevented if $A$ were eliminated. Eliminating $A$ would prevent cases caused by $A$ alone, and it would also prevent the interaction cases, since the interaction cannot occur without $A$.\n- When we calculate $\\mathrm{PAF}_{B}$, we are calculating the proportion of cases that would be prevented if $B$ were eliminated. Eliminating $B$ would prevent cases caused by $B$ alone, and it would also prevent the same interaction cases, since the interaction cannot occur without $B$.\n\nTherefore, the disease burden attributable to the synergistic interaction is counted in the numerator of $\\mathrm{PAF}_{A}$ *and* in the numerator of $\\mathrm{PAF}_{B}$. This \"double counting\" of the jointly determined cases is why the sum of the PAFs can exceed $1$ (or $100\\%$). It reflects the fact that for a substantial portion of the disease burden (the interaction cases), there are two distinct, sufficient interventions (eliminating $A$ or eliminating $B$) that would lead to their prevention. The sum exceeding $1$ is a hallmark of positive interaction between risk factors. It does not imply a logical contradiction but rather highlights the overlapping causal responsibility for disease in the population.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.659}$$", "id": "4621667"}]}
