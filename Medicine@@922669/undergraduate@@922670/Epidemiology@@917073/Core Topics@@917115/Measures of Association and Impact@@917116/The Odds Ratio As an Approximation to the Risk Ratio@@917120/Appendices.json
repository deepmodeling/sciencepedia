The definition of the odds ratio is given as:\n$$ \\mathrm{OR} = \\frac{\\frac{p_{1}}{1 - p_{1}}}{\\frac{p_{0}}{1 - p_{0}}} $$\nwhere $p_{1}$ is the risk in the exposed group. This can be rearranged to:\n$$ \\mathrm{OR} = \\frac{p_{1}(1 - p_{0})}{p_{0}(1 - p_{1})} $$\nThe problem states a multiplicative risk model, where the risk in the exposed group is given by $p_{1} = \\mathrm{RR} \\cdot p_{0}$.

Given $p_0=0.05$, this condition holds.\n$$ \\mathrm{OR} = \\frac{\\mathrm{RR}(1 - p_{0})}{1 - \\mathrm{RR} \\cdot p_{0}} $$\nThis is the required analytic expression for $\\mathrm{OR}$ in terms of $\\mathrm{RR}$ and $p_{0}$. This formula shows that $\\mathrm{OR}$ is equal to $\\mathrm{RR}$ multiplied by a factor of $\\frac{1 - p_{0}}{1 - p_{1}}$.\n\nNext, we are asked to compute the numerical value of $\\mathrm{OR}$ given $p_{0} = 0.05$ and $\\mathrm{RR} = 3$. We first calculate the risk in the exposed group, $p_{1}$:\n$$ p_{1} = \\mathrm{RR} \\cdot p_{0} = 3 \\cdot 0.05 = 0.15 $$\nThis is a valid probability as it lies between $0$ and $1$.

Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $p_{0}$ be the probability of the outcome in the unexposed group and $p_{1}$ be the probability of the outcome in the exposed group. The risk ratio ($\\mathrm{RR}$) and odds ratio ($\\mathrm{OR}$) are defined as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{RR} = \\frac{p_{1}}{p_{0}}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{OR} = \\frac{\\frac{p_{1}}{1 - p_{1}}}{\\frac{p_{0}}{1 - p_{0}}}\n$$\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the relative error of using the $\\mathrm{OR}$ to approximate the $\\mathrm{RR}$, which is defined as $\\frac{\\mathrm{OR}}{\\mathrm{RR}} - 1$. The final expression must be in terms of $p_{0}$ and $\\mathrm{RR}$ only.\n\nFirst, we simplify the ratio $\\frac{\\mathrm{OR}}{\\mathrm{RR}}$ by substituting the given definitions.\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{OR}}{\\mathrm{RR}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{p_{1}}{1 - p_{1}} \\cdot \\frac{1 - p_{0}}{p_{0}} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{p_{1}}{p_{0}} \\right)}\n$$\nWe can rearrange the terms and cancel common factors:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{OR}}{\\mathrm{RR}} = \\frac{p_{1}}{1 - p_{1}} \\cdot \\frac{1 - p_{0}}{p_{0}} \\cdot \\frac{p_{0}}{p_{1}}\n$$\nThe terms $p_{0}$ in the numerator and denominator cancel, as do the terms $p_{1}$. This simplification yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{OR}}{\\mathrm{RR}} = \\frac{1 - p_{0}}{1 - p_{1}}\n$$\nThe goal is to express this quantity solely in terms of $p_{0}$ and $\\mathrm{RR}$. We have an expression with $p_{0}$ and $p_{1}$. We must eliminate $p_{1}$. From the definition of the risk ratio, $\\mathrm{RR} = \\frac{p_{1}}{p_{0}}$, we can express $p_{1}$ in terms of $p_{0}$ and $\\mathrm{RR}$:\n$$\np_{1} = \\mathrm{RR} \\cdot p_{0}\n$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $p_{1}$ into our simplified formula for $\\frac{\\mathrm{OR}}{\\mathrm{RR}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{OR}}{\\mathrm{RR}} = \\frac{1 - p_{0}}{1 - (\\mathrm{RR} \\cdot p_{0})}\n$$\nThe expression is now in the required variables. We can proceed to calculate the relative error.\n$$\n\\text{Relative Error} = \\frac{\\mathrm{OR}}{\\mathrm{RR}} - 1 = \\frac{1 - p_{0}}{1 - \\mathrm{RR} \\cdot p_{0}} - 1\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we find a common denominator:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{OR}}{\\mathrm{RR}} - 1 = \\frac{(1 - p_{0}) - (1 - \\mathrm{RR} \\cdot p_{0})}{1 - \\mathrm{RR} \\cdot p_{0}}\n$$\nExpanding the numerator:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{OR}}{\\mathrm{RR}} - 1 = \\frac{1 - p_{0} - 1 + \\mathrm{RR} \\cdot p_{0}}{1 - \\mathrm{RR} \\cdot p_{0}}\n$$\nThe constant terms cancel out in the numerator:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{OR}}{\\mathrm{RR}} - 1 = \\frac{\\mathrm{RR} \\cdot p_{0} - p_{0}}{1 - \\mathrm{RR} \\cdot p_{0}}\n$$\nFactoring out $p_{0}$ from the numerator gives the final closed-form expression for the relative error:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{OR}}{\\mathrm{RR}} - 1 = \\frac{p_{0}(\\mathrm{RR} - 1)}{1 - \\mathrm{RR} \\cdot p_{0}}\n$$\nThis expression demonstrates that the relative error depends on both the baseline risk, $p_{0}$, and the magnitude of the risk ratio, $\\mathrm{RR}$.\n\nFinally, we analyze the behavior of this error as $p_{0} \\to 0$ while holding $\\mathrm{RR}$ constant. This scenario corresponds to the study of a rare disease, where the probability of the outcome in the unexposed population is very small. We take the limit of the relative error expression:\n$$\n\\lim_{p_{0} \\to 0} \\left( \\frac{p_{0}(\\mathrm{RR} - 1)}{1 - \\mathrm{RR} \\cdot p_{0}} \\right) = \\frac{0 \\cdot (\\mathrm{RR} - 1)}{1 - \\mathrm{RR} \\cdot 0} = \\frac{0}{1} = 0\n$$\nAs $p_{0}$ approaches $0$, the numerator of the relative error expression approaches $0$ while the denominator approaches $1$. Thus, the entire expression approaches $0$. This result shows that when the disease is rare (i.e., $p_{0}$ is small), the relative error is also very small. Consequently, the odds ratio ($\\mathrm{OR}$) serves as a very good approximation of the risk ratio ($\\mathrm{RR}$). This is often referred to as the \"rare disease assumption\" in epidemiology, which justifies the use of the odds ratio from a case-control study as an estimate of the risk ratio that would have been obtained from a cohort study. For small $p_0$, the error is approximately $p_{0}(\\mathrm{RR} - 1)$, indicating it is roughly proportional to the baseline risk.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{p_{0}(\\mathrm{RR} - 1)}{1 - p_{0} \\cdot \\mathrm{RR}}}\n$$", "id": "4645201"}]}
