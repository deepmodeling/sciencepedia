The block randomization scheme specifies a block size of $4$ and a $1:1$ allocation ratio between Treatment ($T$) and Control ($C$).\n\nFirst, let's define the composition of a single block. A block size of $4$ with a $1:1$ allocation ratio means each block contains a multiset of assignments $\\mathcal{B} = \\{T, T, C, C\\}$. The actual sequence of assignments within the block is a random permutation of these four elements. This process is equivalent to sampling without replacement from the multiset $\\mathcal{B}$.\n\nThe total number of distinct sequences (permutations) of the elements in $\\mathcal{B}$ is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n$$N = \\frac{4!}{2! 2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6$$\nEach of these $6$ unique sequences is equally likely to be the randomization sequence for a given block.\n\nLet the sequence of assignments in a block be denoted by $(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4)$. The coordinator observes the first three assignments, $(X_1, X_2, X_3)$, and attempts to guess the fourth, $X_4$. The coordinator's guess is based on the knowledge that the complete block must contain exactly two $T$'s and two $C$'s.\n\nLet $N_T(k)$ and $N_C(k)$ be the number of $T$ and $C$ assignments, respectively, among the first $k$ positions in the sequence. For the entire block, we have the constraint:\n$$N_T(4) = 2$$\n$$N_C(4) = 2$$\n\nAfter observing the first three assignments, the coordinator knows the values of $N_T(3)$ and $N_C(3)$. Since we are sampling without replacement from $\\mathcal{B}$, it is impossible to draw three of the same kind. Thus, the possible compositions of the first three observed assignments are:\n1.  Two $T$'s and one $C$: $N_T(3) = 2$ and $N_C(3) = 1$.\n2.  One $T$ and two $C$'s: $N_T(3) = 1$ and $N_C(3) = 2$.\n\nThese two cases cover all possibilities for the first three assignments. No other combinations are possible.\n\nLet's analyze the coordinator's reasoning in each case.\n\nCase 1: The observed assignments are two $T$'s and one $C$.\nIn this scenario, $N_T(3) = 2$ and $N_C(3) = 1$. The coordinator knows that by the end of the block, there must be a total of two $T$'s. Since two $T$'s have already been assigned, the fourth assignment, $X_4$, cannot be $T$.\nFormally, we know $N_T(4) = N_T(3) + I(X_4 = T)$, where $I(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function.\n$$2 = 2 + I(X_4 = T)$$\nThis implies $I(X_4 = T) = 0$, so $X_4 \\neq T$. Since the only other possibility is $C$, the fourth assignment must be $C$.\nThe coordinator, using this exact logic, will guess that the fourth assignment is $C$. Since the fourth assignment is deterministically $C$, the coordinator's guess is correct with probability $1$.\n\nCase 2: The observed assignments are one $T$ and two $C$'s.\nIn this scenario, $N_T(3) = 1$ and $N_C(3) = 2$. The coordinator knows that the complete block must contain two $C$'s. Since both $C$ assignments have already occurred, the fourth assignment, $X_4$, cannot be $C$.\nFormally, we use the constraint for $C$: $N_C(4) = N_C(3) + I(X_4 = C)$.\n$$2 = 2 + I(X_4 = C)$$\nThis implies $I(X_4 = C) = 0$, so $X_4 \\neq C$. The fourth assignment must therefore be $T$.\nThe coordinator's guess will be $T$. Since the fourth assignment is deterministically $T$, the coordinator's guess is again correct with probability $1$.\n\nLet $E$ be the event that the coordinator's guess is correct. Let $A_1$ be the event that the first three assignments consist of two $T$'s and one $C$. Let $A_2$ be the event that the first three assignments consist of one $T$ and two $C$'s. As established, these two events form a partition of the space of possible outcomes for the first three observations.\nThe overall probability of a correct guess can be found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(E) = P(E | A_1) P(A_1) + P(E | A_2) P(A_2)$$\nFrom our analysis:\n- If event $A_1$ occurs, the fourth assignment is deterministically $C$, and the coordinator guesses $C$. Thus, the probability of a correct guess given $A_1$ is $P(E | A_1) = 1$.\n- If event $A_2$ occurs, the fourth assignment is deterministically $T$, and the coordinator guesses $T$. Thus, the probability of a correct guess given $A_2$ is $P(E | A_2) = 1$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$P(E) = (1) \\cdot P(A_1) + (1) \\cdot P(A_2) = P(A_1) + P(A_2)$$\nSince $A_1$ and $A_2$ represent all possible outcomes for the first three assignments, their probabilities must sum to $1$:\n$$P(A_1) + P(A_2) = 1$$\nTherefore, the probability that the coordinator can correctly guess the fourth assignment is:\n$$P(E) = 1$$\nThis conclusion holds regardless of the specific sequence of the first three assignments. In every possible scenario, the coordinator has sufficient information to deduce the fourth assignment with certainty.\n\nThe problem requires the answer as a decimal.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.0}\n$$", "id": "4639930"}, {"introduction": "Even in a perfectly designed and randomized trial, a common limitation arises after randomization: participants may not adhere to their assigned treatment.

Calculation of the Intention-To-Treat (ITT) Effect**\n\nThe ITT effect is defined as the effect of treatment *assignment* on the outcome, regardless of the treatment actually received. It is calculated as the difference in the mean outcomes between the group assigned to the intervention and the group assigned to the control.\n\n$$\n\\text{ITT} = E[Y \\mid Z=1] - E[Y \\mid Z=0]\n$$\n\nUsing the provided data:\n\n$$\n\\text{ITT} = 0.30 - 0.40 = -0.10\n$$\n\nThis can be expressed as an exact fraction: $\\text{ITT} = -\\frac{1}{10}$.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE)**\n\nThe CACE is the average causal effect of the treatment among the subpopulation of individuals known as \"compliers.\" Under the standard instrumental variable (IV) assumptions provided in the problem statement (independence, exclusion restriction, monotonicity, and a nonzero first stage), the CACE can be estimated using the Wald estimator. This estimator is the ratio of the ITT effect on the outcome ($Y$) to the ITT effect on treatment receipt ($A$).\n\nThe formula for the CACE is:\n\n$$\n\\text{CACE} = \\frac{E[Y \\mid Z=1] - E[Y \\mid Z=0]}{E[A \\mid Z=1] - E[A \\mid Z=0]}\n$$\n\nThe numerator is the ITT effect, which we have already calculated as $-0.10$. The denominator represents the difference in the proportion of individuals receiving the treatment between the intervention and control arms. This is often referred to as the \"first stage\" effect, which quantifies the success of the encouragement ($Z$) in changing the behavior ($A$).\n\nLet's calculate the denominator:\n\n$$\nE[A \\mid Z=1] - E[A \\mid Z=0] = P(A=1 \\mid Z=1) - P(A=1 \\mid Z=0) = 0.80 - 0.10 = 0.70\n$$\n\nThe assumption of a \"nonzero first stage\" is met, as $0.70 \\neq 0$.\n\nNow, we can compute the CACE:\n\n$$\n\\text{CACE} = \\frac{-0.10}{0.70} = \\frac{-1/10}{7/10} = -\\frac{1}{7}\n$$\n\n**3. Interpretation of Results**\n\nThe problem also asks for an interpretation of these quantities in the context of the strengths and limitations of RCTs with noncompliance.\n\n- **ITT Effect Interpretation**: The ITT effect is $-0.10$. This means that *assigning* an individual to the intervention, as a policy, reduces their probability of experiencing the adverse outcome by $10$ percentage points on average, compared to assigning them to the control group. A key **strength** of the ITT estimate is that it is unbiased by confounding factors. Because it compares groups based on the initial random assignment, it preserves the baseline balance of all measured and unmeasured covariates between the two arms. This makes it a highly robust and pragmatically important estimate for evaluating the real-world effectiveness of a public health program or policy. However, its **limitation** is that it provides a diluted or conservative estimate of the treatment's true efficacy. The effect is averaged over both compliers and non-compliers (those who received the treatment and those who did not in the intervention arm), so it does not represent the effect of actually *receiving* the treatment.\n\n- **CACE Effect Interpretation**: The CACE is $-\\frac{1}{7} \\approx -0.143$. This means that for the specific subgroup of \"compliers\" (individuals who would take the intervention if assigned to it, and not take it if assigned to control), the intervention *itself* reduces the probability of the adverse outcome by approximately $14.3$ percentage points. A **strength** of the CACE is that it adjusts for noncompliance to provide an estimate of the causal effect of the treatment itself, which is often of greater biological or mechanistic interest. It is a \"de-contaminated\" estimate, representing what the effect would be in the compliant subpopulation. The **limitation** of the CACE is twofold. First, it relies on strong, untestable assumptions, particularly the exclusion restriction (assignment affects the outcome only through treatment receipt) and monotonicity (no \"defiers\" exist). If these assumptions are violated, the estimate is biased. Second, the CACE is not an effect for the entire population but only for the unobservable subgroup of compliers. Its generalizability to other groups (e.g., \"always-takers\" or \"never-takers\") or to the full population is not guaranteed, which can limit its policy relevance compared to the ITT. The CACE is larger in magnitude ($-0.143$ vs. $-0.10$) than the ITT effect, which is expected, as the ITT effect is diluted by the $30\\%$ non-compliance ($20\\%$ in the treatment arm and $10\\%$ in the control arm who \"cross over\"). The CACE essentially re-scales the ITT effect by the proportion of compliers in the population, which is estimated by the denominator $E[A|Z=1]-E[A|Z=0]=0.70$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{10}  -\\frac{1}{7} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4639879"}, {"introduction": "While many RCTs randomize individuals, some interventions necessitate randomizing groups, or 'clusters,' such as clinics, schools, or entire communities.
