A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the derivation and computation of the sample estimator for the Intention-to-Treat (ITT) risk difference.\n\nThe ITT principle dictates that a comparison is made between the groups as they were originally randomized, regardless of adherence to the assigned intervention. The causal estimand of interest is the risk difference, defined as the difference in the average outcomes between the two arms. Let $E[Y|Z=z]$ be the expected value of the outcome $Y$ for individuals assigned to arm $Z=z$. Since $Y$ is a binary indicator variable ($0$ or $1$), its expected value is equal to the probability that $Y=1$, which is the risk of the adverse outcome.\n$$E[Y|Z=z] = 1 \\cdot P(Y=1|Z=z) + 0 \\cdot P(Y=0|Z=z) = P(Y=1|Z=z) = \\text{Risk}_{z}$$\n\nThe ITT risk difference estimand, denoted $\\Delta_{\\text{ITT}}$, is the difference in these expected outcomes (risks) between the counseling arm ($Z=1$) and the usual care arm ($Z=0$).\n$$\\Delta_{\\text{ITT}} = E[Y|Z=1] - E[Y|Z=0]$$\n\nTo obtain a sample estimator for this population estimand, we use the method of moments or the analogy principle, where population expectations are replaced by their corresponding sample averages. The problem states that the empirical risk (the sample estimator for the risk) in each arm is the sample mean of $Y$.\n- The sample estimator for $E[Y|Z=1]$ is the sample mean outcome in the arm assigned to counseling, which is given as $\\bar{Y}_{1}$.\n- The sample estimator for $E[Y|Z=0]$ is the sample mean outcome in the arm assigned to usual care, which is given as $\\bar{Y}_{0}$.\n\nTherefore, the sample estimator for the ITT risk difference, denoted $\\hat{\\Delta}_{\\text{ITT}}$, is the difference between these two sample means:\n$$\\hat{\\Delta}_{\\text{ITT}} = \\bar{Y}_{1} - \\bar{Y}_{0}$$\n\nThe problem provides the following observed values for the arm-specific sample means:\n- $\\bar{Y}_{1} = 0.30$\n- $\\bar{Y}_{0} = 0.40$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the sample estimator:\n$$\\hat{\\Delta}_{\\text{ITT}} = 0.30 - 0.40 = -0.10$$\n\nThe computed value of the ITT risk difference estimator is $-0.10$.\n\nThe final part of the problem asks for an interpretation of the sign of this value.\n- The risk difference is calculated as (Risk in counseling arm) - (Risk in usual care arm).\n- A negative value ($\\hat{\\Delta}_{\\text{ITT}} < 0$) indicates that the estimated risk of the adverse outcome in the counseling arm ($\\bar{Y}_{1}$) is lower than the estimated risk in the usual care arm ($\\bar{Y}_{0}$).\n- Since the outcome $Y=1$ is adverse, a lower risk is a desirable outcome, indicating a benefit.\n- Therefore, the negative sign of the computed value ($-0.10$) indicates a benefit of the behavioral counseling assignment relative to usual care, as it is associated with a reduction in the risk of the adverse outcome.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-0.10}\n$$", "id": "4593130"}, {"introduction": "While ITT analysis provides a robust estimate of the effect of being assigned to an intervention, we often want to understand the effect of actually receiving it, especially when adherence is imperfect. This exercise introduces the Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE), which estimates the treatment effect specifically among the sub-group of individuals who would follow their treatment assignment. By treating the randomized assignment as an \"instrumental variable,\" we can isolate the effect of treatment uptake itself, providing a different but crucial causal estimate. [@problem_id:4593136]", "problem": "A randomized encouragement trial is used to evaluate the effect of a preventive intervention on a binary adverse outcome. Let $Z \\in \\{0,1\\}$ denote the randomized encouragement indicator, $D \\in \\{0,1\\}$ denote actual uptake of the intervention, and $Y \\in \\{0,1\\}$ denote whether the adverse outcome occurs during follow-up (e.g., occurrence of infection within $30$ days). Assume the following foundational conditions hold: random assignment of $Z$ ensures independence of potential outcomes and compliance types from $Z$, the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) ensures well-defined potential outcomes without interference, monotonicity (no defiers) ensures $D(1) \\geq D(0)$ for every participant, and the exclusion restriction ensures that $Z$ affects $Y$ only through $D$.

Round your final numerical answer to $4$ significant figures and express it as a decimal (not a percentage). Finally, briefly interpret the magnitude and direction of the estimated effect in terms of absolute risk change among compliers.", "solution": "The problem is valid. It is a well-posed question in causal inference, a core area of epidemiology and biostatistics. It provides a complete set of standard assumptions (SUTVA, randomization, monotonicity, exclusion restriction) and sufficient data to derive and compute the Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE).\n\nThe objective is to derive an analytical expression for the CACE and compute its value. The CACE is defined as the average causal effect of the intervention on the outcome within the subpopulation of \"compliers\".\n\nLet $Y(d)$ be the potential outcome for an individual if their intervention status were $d \\in \\{0,1\\}$, and let $D(z)$ be the potential intervention uptake if their encouragement status were $z \\in \\{0,1\\}$. The CACE is formally defined as $E[Y(1) - Y(0) \\mid \\text{compliers}]$.\n\nFirst, we define the principal strata or compliance types based on the potential treatment uptake vector $(D(0), D(1))$. Under the monotonicity assumption, which states $D(1) \\geq D(0)$ for every individual, there are three possible compliance types:\n1.  **Compliers**: Individuals who would take the intervention if encouraged but not otherwise. For them, $D(1)=1$ and $D(0)=0$. Let their population proportion be $\\pi_c$.\n2.  **Always-Takers**: Individuals who would take the intervention regardless of encouragement. For them, $D(1)=1$ and $D(0)=1$. Let their proportion be $\\pi_{at}$.\n3.  **Never-Takers**: Individuals who would not take the intervention regardless of encouragement. For them, $D(1)=0$ and $D(0)=0$. Let their proportion be $\\pi_{nt}$.\nThe monotonicity assumption rules out \"defiers\", for whom $D(1)=0$ and $D(0)=1$. Thus, $\\pi_c + \\pi_{at} + \\pi_{nt} = 1$.\n\nThe proportion of these unobserved groups can be identified from observable data. The proportion of individuals taking the intervention in the encouragement group ($Z=1$) is the sum of the proportions of compliers and always-takers. By the random assignment of $Z$, the distribution of compliance types is the same in both arms of the trial.\n$$P(D=1 \\mid Z=1) = P(D(1)=1) = \\pi_c + \\pi_{at}$$\nThe proportion of individuals taking the intervention in the control group ($Z=0$) are the always-takers.\n$$P(D=1 \\mid Z=0) = P(D(0)=1) = \\pi_{at}$$\nSubtracting the second equation from the first gives the proportion of compliers:\n$$\\pi_c = P(D=1 \\mid Z=1) - P(D=1 \\mid Z=0)$$\nSince $D$ is a binary variable, $P(D=1 \\mid Z=z) = E[D \\mid Z=z]$. Therefore:\n$$\\pi_c = E[D \\mid Z=1] - E[D \\mid Z=0]$$\n\nNext, we analyze the overall or \"Intent-to-Treat\" (ITT) effect on the outcome, which is the difference in average outcomes between the encouragement and control groups, $E[Y \\mid Z=1] - E[Y \\mid Z=0]$. We can express the expected outcome in each arm by conditioning on the compliance strata:\n$$E[Y \\mid Z=1] = E[Y \\mid Z=1, \\text{compliers}]\\pi_c + E[Y \\mid Z=1, \\text{always-takers}]\\pi_{at} + E[Y \\mid Z=1, \\text{never-takers}]\\pi_{nt}$$\n$$E[Y \\mid Z=0] = E[Y \\mid Z=0, \\text{compliers}]\\pi_c + E[Y \\mid Z=0, \\text{always-takers}]\\pi_{at} + E[Y \\mid Z=0, \\text{never-takers}]\\pi_{nt}$$\n\nNow we apply the exclusion restriction and randomization assumptions. The exclusion restriction implies that encouragement $Z$ affects the outcome $Y$ only through its effect on treatment uptake $D$. This means an individual's outcome depends only on the treatment they receive, not on their assignment to encouragement.\nFor a **complier**, being assigned $Z=1$ means they take the treatment ($D=1$), so their outcome is $Y(1)$. Being assigned $Z=0$ means they do not take the treatment ($D=0$), so their outcome is $Y(0)$. Thus, $E[Y \\mid Z=1, \\text{compliers}] = E[Y(1) \\mid \\text{compliers}]$ and $E[Y \\mid Z=0, \\text{compliers}] = E[Y(0) \\mid \\text{compliers}]$.\nFor an **always-taker**, they always take the treatment ($D=1$), regardless of $Z$. Their outcome is always $Y(1)$. So, $E[Y \\mid Z=1, \\text{always-takers}] = E[Y \\mid Z=0, \\text{always-takers}] = E[Y(1) \\mid \\text{always-takers}]$.\nFor a **never-taker**, they never take the treatment ($D=0$), regardless of $Z$. Their outcome is always $Y(0)$. So, $E[Y \\mid Z=1, \\text{never-takers}] = E[Y \\mid Z=0, \\text{never-takers}] = E[Y(0) \\mid \\text{never-takers}]$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expressions for $E[Y \\mid Z=z]$:\n$$E[Y \\mid Z=1] = E[Y(1) \\mid \\text{compliers}]\\pi_c + E[Y(1) \\mid \\text{always-takers}]\\pi_{at} + E[Y(0) \\mid \\text{never-takers}]\\pi_{nt}$$\n$$E[Y \\mid Z=0] = E[Y(0) \\mid \\text{compliers}]\\pi_c + E[Y(1) \\mid \\text{always-takers}]\\pi_{at} + E[Y(0) \\mid \\text{never-takers}]\\pi_{nt}$$\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, the terms for always-takers and never-takers cancel out:\n$$E[Y \\mid Z=1] - E[Y \\mid Z=0] = \\left( E[Y(1) \\mid \\text{compliers}] - E[Y(0) \\mid \\text{compliers}] \\right) \\pi_c$$\nThe term in parentheses is the definition of CACE, $E[Y(1)-Y(0) \\mid \\text{compliers}]$. Rearranging the equation to solve for CACE, we get:\n$$\\text{CACE} = \\frac{E[Y \\mid Z=1] - E[Y \\mid Z=0]}{\\pi_c}$$\nSubstituting our earlier result for $\\pi_c$:\n$$\\text{CACE} = \\frac{E[Y \\mid Z=1] - E[Y \\mid Z=0]}{E[D \\mid Z=1] - E[D \\mid Z=0]}$$\nThis is the instrumental variable (IV) estimator formula, where the ITT effect on the outcome is scaled by the ITT effect on treatment uptake.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n$P(D=1 \\mid Z=1) = E[D \\mid Z=1] = 0.80$\n$P(D=1 \\mid Z=0) = E[D \\mid Z=0] = 0.20$\n$E[Y \\mid Z=1] = 0.30$\n$E[Y \\mid Z=0] = 0.40$\n\nThe numerator (ITT effect on outcome $Y$):\n$$E[Y \\mid Z=1] - E[Y \\mid Z=0] = 0.30 - 0.40 = -0.10$$\nThe denominator (proportion of compliers, or ITT effect on uptake $D$):\n$$E[D \\mid Z=1] - E[D \\mid Z=0] = 0.80 - 0.20 = 0.60$$\nThus, the CACE is:\n$$\\text{CACE} = \\frac{-0.10}{0.60} = -\\frac{1}{6} \\approx -0.16666...$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we get $-0.1667$.\n\nThe CACE represents the average causal effect of the intervention on the outcome for the subpopulation of individuals who adhere to their encouragement status (the compliers). A value of $-0.1667$ indicates that for compliers, receiving the preventive intervention causes a reduction in the absolute risk of the adverse outcome. Specifically, among those who would take the intervention only if encouraged, the intervention reduces the probability of infection by an estimated $0.1667$, or $16.67$ percentage points.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.1667}$$", "id": "4593136"}, {"introduction": "In many public health settings, randomizing individuals is not feasible; instead, we randomize groups or \"clusters\" like schools, villages, or clinics.
