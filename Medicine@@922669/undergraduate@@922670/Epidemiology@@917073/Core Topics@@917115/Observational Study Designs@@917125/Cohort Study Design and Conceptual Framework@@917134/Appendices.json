The fundamental principle is that person-time is the sum of the durations each individual participant remains at risk for the outcome. The period at risk for each participant begins at their entry time and ends at the earliest of three possible events: occurrence of the health outcome, loss to follow-up (LTFU), or administrative censoring.\n\nThe given parameters are the administrative censoring time $T_c = 36$ months, and for each participant $i$, an entry time $E_i$ and an exit time $X_i$ with an associated reason. The per-participant contribution to person-time, denoted $PT_i$, is the time interval between their entry into the risk set and their exit from it.\n\nThe starting point of the observation interval for participant $i$ is their entry time, $E_i$.\nThe end point of the observation interval for participant $i$, which we can denote $t_{end, i}$, is determined by the minimum of their specified exit time $X_i$ (due to an event or LTFU) and the administrative censoring time $T_c$.

Let $t=0$ denote cohort entry. Participants are eligible and event-free at baseline. A total of $N=2000$ participants are followed for $2$ years. Of these, $1000$ initiate the medication at exactly $t=1$ year, and $1000$ never initiate. The event of interest is death. The underlying event process for an individual at time $t$ is described by a constant hazard while unexposed and a reduced constant hazard after initiation, with no effect before initiation. Specifically, while unexposed, the hazard is $\\lambda_0=0.10$ deaths per person-year, and once initiated, the hazard becomes $\\lambda_1=\\theta\\lambda_0$ with $\\theta=0.60$.

Analysis of the Naive Approach**\nThe naive analysis compares two groups fixed at baseline:\n- **\"Exposed\" Group ($E_i=1$)**: The $N_{E=1} = 1000$ individuals who initiate treatment at $t=1$.\n- **\"Unexposed\" Group ($E_i=0$)**: The $N_{E=0} = 1000$ individuals who never initiate treatment.\n\nWe must calculate the expected incidence rate in each group over the $2$-year follow-up period $[0, 2)$.\n\n**Calculation for the \"Exposed\" Group ($E_i=1$)**:\nThe follow-up for this group is split into two distinct periods.\n-   **Interval $[0, 1)$**: During this period, these individuals are not yet taking the medication. Crucially, the problem states they *must* survive this period to initiate at $t=1$. This period is \"immortal time\" because death is impossible by definition.\n    -   Number of events (deaths): $D_1 = 0$.\n    -   Person-time: $PT_1 = 1000 \\text{ persons} \\times 1 \\text{ year} = 1000 \\text{ Person-Years (PY)}$.\n-   **Interval $[1, 2)$**: At $t=1$, the $1000$ survivors initiate the medication. Their hazard rate becomes $\\lambda_1 = \\theta \\lambda_0 = 0.60 \\times 0.10 = 0.06$ deaths/PY.\n    -   The number of individuals alive at the start of this interval is $N(1) = 1000$.\n    -   The expected number of events in this interval is given by $D_2 = N(1) \\times (1 - e^{-\\lambda_1 (2-1)}) = 1000 \\times (1 - e^{-0.06}) \\approx 58.235$.\n    -   The person-time accrued in this interval is $PT_2 = \\int_{1}^{2} N(1) e^{-\\lambda_1 (t-1)} dt = \\frac{N(1)}{\\lambda_1} (1 - e^{-\\lambda_1}) = \\frac{1000}{0.06} (1 - e^{-0.06}) \\approx 970.66$ PY.\n-   **Total for the \"Exposed\" Group**:\n    -   Total Events: $D_{E=1} = D_1 + D_2 = 0 + 58.235 = 58.235$.\n    -   Total Person-Time: $PT_{E=1} = PT_1 + PT_2 = 1000 + 970.66 = 1970.66$ PY.\n    -   Incidence Rate: $\\text{IR}_{E=1} = \\frac{D_{E=1}}{PT_{E=1}} = \\frac{58.235}{1970.66} \\approx 0.02955$ deaths/PY.\n\n**Calculation for the \"Unexposed\" Group ($E_i=0$)**:\nThese $1000$ individuals are unexposed for the entire interval $[0, 2)$, with a constant hazard $\\lambda_0 = 0.10$ deaths/PY.\n-   **Interval $[0, 2)$**:\n    -   Expected number of events: $D_{E=0} = 1000 \\times (1 - e^{-\\lambda_0 \\times 2}) = 1000 \\times (1 - e^{-0.2}) \\approx 181.27$.\n    -   Person-time accrued: $PT_{E=0} = \\int_{0}^{2} 1000 e^{-\\lambda_0 t} dt = \\frac{1000}{\\lambda_0} (1 - e^{-2\\lambda_0}) = \\frac{1000}{0.10} (1 - e^{-0.2}) \\approx 1812.7$ PY.\n-   **Total for the \"Unexposed\" Group**:\n    -   Incidence Rate: $\\text{IR}_{E=0} = \\frac{D_{E=0}}{PT_{E=0}} = \\frac{181.27}{1812.7} \\approx 0.10$ deaths/PY.

This is substantially smaller than the true causal HR of $0.60$, indicating a strong bias. The bias is towards a more protective effect than is true; it is a spurious magnification of the medication's benefit. This is the hallmark of immortal time bias.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In the naive baseline $E_i$ analysis, the exposed group’s rate is artificially reduced because the $[0,1)$ interval among initiators contains $0$ deaths by construction yet is counted as exposed person-time, yielding an incidence rate ratio near $0.30$ versus the true causal HR of $\\theta=0.60$; the correct re-specification is to model exposure as time-varying $E_i(t)$, splitting each participant’s follow-up into unexposed and exposed intervals and fitting a time-dependent Cox model or a Poisson model with Lexis expansion, thereby aligning risk sets and eliminating immortal time.**\nThis option correctly describes the mechanism of immortal time bias: the event-free period before treatment initiation is incorrectly attributed to the \"exposed\" group, artificially lowering its calculated event rate. The calculation confirms the naive IRR is near $0.30$, compared to the true HR of $0.60$. The proposed solution—modeling exposure as a time-varying covariate in a Cox or Poisson model—is the standard and correct method to handle this bias. This method correctly allocates person-time for the initiators to the unexposed risk set during $[0,1)$ and to the exposed risk set during $[1,2)$, thus making a valid comparison of hazards at each point in time.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The naive baseline $E_i$ analysis biases the effect toward harm (incidence rate ratio above $1.00$), because pre-initiation person-time has more events; the correct fix is to exclude the pre-initiation person-time from the denominators for the exposed group only while keeping all person-time for the unexposed group.**\nThe first claim is incorrect; the bias is towards a spurious protective effect (IRR $\\approx 0.30 < 1.00$), not towards harm. The reason given is also incorrect; the pre-initiation person-time for the initiator group has $0$ events, not more events. Finally, the proposed \"fix\" is invalid. Simply removing person-time from one group's denominator while not reallocating it properly leads to another form of bias and does not constitute a principled analysis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The naive baseline $E_i$ analysis is unbiased when outcomes are rare, so the incidence rate ratio equals the true $\\theta=0.60$; the correct specification is to adjust for baseline confounders while retaining the time-fixed exposure indicator.**\nThe bias from immortal time is a structural misclassification of person-time and is not dependent on the rare outcome assumption. Our calculations show a large bias ($0.30$ vs. $0.60$) which would persist even if the absolute rates were lower. Adjusting for baseline confounders is important for controlling confounding, but it does not address the time-dependent nature of the bias caused by misclassifying exposure status over time. The time-fixed exposure indicator is the source of the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. To remove immortal time, re-specify a Cox model that left-truncates exposed individuals at their initiation time (start their clock at $t=1$) but starts unexposed individuals at $t=0$, ensuring comparability of hazards across groups.**\nThis approach is invalid and introduces severe selection bias. By starting the exposed group's follow-up at $t=1$, one is selecting only those who survived the first year. Comparing them to the unexposed group from $t=0$ means the two groups are not comparable; they are on different time scales and have different survivorship criteria for being included in the analysis at their respective starting points. All individuals in a cohort study must be followed from a common time zero on the same time scale.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. The naive baseline $E_i$ analysis produces a spuriously protective association for beneficial exposures; an alternative valid re-specification is to emulate a target trial by defining strategies such as “initiate within $1$ year” versus “no initiation,” set baseline as time zero for all, assign participants to strategies via cloning, enforce strategy adherence via censoring, and apply Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) within the Cloning, Censoring, and Weighting (CCW) framework to handle selection and time-varying confounding, which removes immortal time bias by design.**\nThis option correctly identifies the direction of the bias as a \"spuriously protective association.\" It then describes a modern and valid causal inference method—the emulation of a target trial—to address this issue. This framework explicitly defines treatment strategies from a common time zero, thereby eliminating immortal time by design. The use of cloning, censoring for non-adherence, and IPW is a rigorous way to estimate the causal effect of these strategies, especially in the presence of time-varying confounding (though not present in this simplified problem, the method itself is valid). This is a correct, albeit more advanced, alternative to the time-dependent model described in option A.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Conclusion**\nBoth options A and E correctly identify the direction of the bias and propose valid methods to correct it. Option A describes the traditional and most direct solution. Option E describes a more complex but equally valid causal inference approach. As the question asks for the valid model re-specification(s), both are correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "4578256"}]}
