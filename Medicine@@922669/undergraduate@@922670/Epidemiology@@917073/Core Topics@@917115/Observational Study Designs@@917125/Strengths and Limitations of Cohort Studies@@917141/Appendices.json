It is a well-posed problem in epidemiology, providing all necessary data and assumptions to compute a unique, meaningful solution. The problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of cohort study design and incidence rate calculation.\n\nThe primary task is to calculate the incidence rate ($IR$) for the given cohort. The incidence rate is defined as the number of new cases of a disease divided by the total person-time at risk in the population. The formula is:\n$$\nIR = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases}}{\\text{Total person-time at risk}}\n$$\nFirst, we must compute the person-time contributed by each of the $8$ participants in the cohort. Person-time is the duration for which each individual is under observation and at risk of developing the outcome. The observation for each participant ends at the earliest of three events: outcome onset, loss to follow-up, or the administrative end of the study at $36$ months.\n\nWe calculate the person-time in months for each participant:\n-   Participant $1$: Enters at month $0$ and develops the outcome at month $10$. Person-time = $10 - 0 = 10$ months. This is an incident case.\n-   Participant $2$: Enters at month $0$ and is lost to follow-up at month $20$. Person-time = $20 - 0 = 20$ months.\n-   Participant $3$: Enters at month $6$ and develops the outcome at month $30$. Person-time = $30 - 6 = 24$ months. This is an incident case.\n-   Participant $4$: Enters at month $12$ and is followed until the study's end at month $36$ without an outcome. Person-time = $36 - 12 = 24$ months.\n-   Participant $5$: Enters at month $15$ and develops the outcome at month $28$. Person-time = $28 - 15 = 13$ months. This is an incident case.\n-   Participant $6$: Enters at month $18$ and is lost to follow-up at month $24$. Person-time = $24 - 18 = 6$ months.\n-   Participant $7$: Enters at month $24$ and develops the outcome at month $35$. Person-time = $35 - 24 = 11$ months. This is an incident case.\n-   Participant $8$: Enters at month $30$ and is followed until the study's end at month $36$ without an outcome. Person-time = $36 - 30 = 6$ months.\n\nThe total number of incident outcomes is the count of participants who developed the condition: Participants $1$, $3$, $5$, and $7$.\n$$\n\\text{Total number of incident outcomes} = 4\n$$\nThe total person-time is the sum of the individual contributions:\n$$\n\\text{Total Person-Time (months)} = 10 + 20 + 24 + 24 + 13 + 6 + 11 + 6 = 114 \\text{ months}\n$$\nThe problem requires the incidence rate to be expressed in events per $100$ person-years. Therefore, we must convert the total person-time from months to years. Since there are $12$ months in a year:\n$$\n\\text{Total Person-Time (years)} = \\frac{114 \\text{ months}}{12 \\text{ months/year}} = 9.5 \\text{ years}\n$$\nNow we can compute the incidence rate:\n$$\nIR = \\frac{4 \\text{ events}}{9.5 \\text{ person-years}} \\approx 0.4210526... \\text{ events per person-year}\n$$\nTo express this rate per $100$ person-years, we multiply by $100$:\n$$\nIR_{\\text{per 100 PY}} = \\left( \\frac{4}{9.5} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 42.10526... \\text{ events per 100 person-years}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$\nIR_{\\text{rounded}} = 42.1 \\text{ events per 100 person-years}\n$$\nFinally, we address the justification for using a person-time denominator. Person-time denominators mitigate bias from differential follow-up by precisely accounting for the actual at-risk time each individual contributes, ensuring that the calculated rate reflects the true instantaneous risk of the outcome and is not distorted by varying observation periods. Under the assumption of non-informative censoring, this method provides an unbiased estimate of the incidence rate even in a dynamic cohort with staggered entry and losses to follow-up.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{42.1}\n$$", "id": "4639160"}, {"introduction": "While cohort studies excel at estimating relative risks ($RR$), this comparative measure may not be the most informative for clinical or public health decision-making. This practice problem demonstrates the crucial skill of translating a relative effect into absolute terms, such as the absolute risk difference ($RD$) and the number needed to treat ($NNT$).

A common comparative measure in cohort studies is the relative risk, denoted $RR$, defined as\n$$\nRR = \\frac{CI_{1}}{CI_{0}},\n$$\nwhere $CI_{1}$ is the cumulative incidence in the treated (exposed) group and $CI_{0}$ is the cumulative incidence in the untreated (unexposed) group.\n\nStarting from this definition, we solve for $CI_{1}$:\n$$\nCI_{1} = RR \\times CI_{0}.\n$$\nWith $RR = 0.75$ and $CI_{0} = 0.20$, the treated group’s $5$-year risk is\n$$\nCI_{1} = 0.75 \\times 0.20 = 0.15.\n$$\n\nThe absolute risk difference, denoted $RD$, is defined as the difference in risks between groups:\n$$\nRD = CI_{1} - CI_{0}.\n$$\nSubstituting the values,\n$$\nRD = 0.15 - 0.20 = -0.05.\n$$\nThis negative value indicates an absolute risk reduction; its magnitude is $|RD| = 0.05$.\n\nThe number needed to treat (NNT) over the specified time horizon is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction’s magnitude:\n$$\n\\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{|RD|} = \\frac{1}{0.05} = 20.\n$$\n\nInterpretation and implications for decision-making: Although the relative risk $RR = 0.75$ is a dimensionless comparative measure that cohort studies can estimate directly and robustly, the absolute risk difference $RD$ and the NNT depend on the baseline risk $CI_{0}$. In general,\n$$\nRD = (RR - 1)\\,CI_{0},\n$$\nso for a fixed $RR$, a higher baseline risk $CI_{0}$ yields a larger absolute risk reduction $|RD|$ and a smaller NNT; conversely, a lower $CI_{0}$ yields a smaller $|RD|$ and a larger NNT. Therefore, translating $RR$ into $RD$ and NNT can alter resource allocation and clinical policy across populations with different baseline risks, even if the relative effect is constant. This illustrates a strength of cohort studies—the ability to estimate incidence and temporal sequence, facilitating computation of $RD$ and NNT—but also limitations: external validity may be constrained if the baseline risk in the study differs from that of the target population, so $RD$ and NNT may not transport directly. Additionally, cohort studies can be affected by residual confounding, selection bias (including loss to follow-up), and measurement error, which may influence both $RR$ and the derived absolute measures. Finally, NNT is horizon-specific; its value depends on the $5$-year window chosen here, underscoring the need to align time horizons with decision contexts.\n\nThus, for this $5$-year horizon, the number needed to treat is $20$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20}$$", "id": "4639141"}, {"introduction": "A primary limitation of any observational study, including cohort studies, is the potential for unmeasured confounding to bias the results.

The ranges are $R_{EU} \\in [1, 3]$ and $RR_{UD} \\in [1, 2.4]$. The parameter $p_0 = P(U=1|E=0)$ is an unknown prevalence, so $0 \\le p_0 \\le 1$. Furthermore, $p_1 = R_{EU} \\cdot p_0$ must also be a valid probability, so $p_1 \\le 1$, which implies $p_0 \\le 1/R_{EU}$.\n\nWe need to maximize $B(p_0, R_{EU}, RR_{UD})$ over its domain.\nLet's analyze the behavior of $B$ with respect to each parameter.\n1.  Dependence on $RR_{UD}$: Let $X = RR_{UD} - 1$, where $X \\in [0, 1.4]$. The bias factor is $B = \\frac{1 + R_{EU}p_0 X}{1 + p_0 X}$. The partial derivative with respect to $X$ is $\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial X} = \\frac{p_0(R_{EU}-1)}{(1+p_0 X)^2}$. Since $p_0 \\ge 0$ and $R_{EU} \\ge 1$, we have $\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial X} \\ge 0$. Thus, $B$ is a non-decreasing function of $RR_{UD}$, and its maximum will occur at $RR_{UD}^{\\text{max}} = 2.4$.\n\n2.  Dependence on $R_{EU}$: For fixed $p_0 > 0$ and $RR_{UD} > 1$, the numerator of $B$ increases with $R_{EU}$ while the denominator remains constant. Thus, $B$ is an increasing function of $R_{EU}$.\n\n3.  Dependence on $p_0$: For fixed $R_{EU}$ and $RR_{UD}$, let $C_1 = R_{EU}(RR_{UD}-1)$ and $C_2 = RR_{UD}-1$. The bias factor is $B(p_0) = \\frac{1+C_1 p_0}{1+C_2 p_0}$. The derivative is $\\frac{dB}{dp_0} = \\frac{C_1-C_2}{(1+C_2 p_0)^2} = \\frac{(R_{EU}-1)(RR_{UD}-1)}{(1+p_0(RR_{UD}-1))^2}$. Since $R_{EU} \\ge 1$ and $RR_{UD} \\ge 1$, we have $\\frac{dB}{dp_0} \\ge 0$. Thus, $B$ is a non-decreasing function of $p_0$.\n\nTo maximize $B$, we must maximize $p_0$, $R_{EU}$, and $RR_{UD}$ under the constraint $p_0 \\le 1/R_{EU}$. This means we should choose the largest possible values for the parameters.\nWe set $RR_{UD}$ to its maximum value, $RR_{UD}^{\\text{max}} = 2.4$.\nTo maximize $B$ over $p_0$ and $R_{EU}$, we note that for any fixed $R_{EU} \\in [1, 3]$, $B$ is maximized by choosing the largest possible $p_0$, which is $p_0 = 1/R_{EU}$. Substituting this into the expression for $B$, we get a function of $R_{EU}$ alone (assuming $RR_{UD}$ is at its maximum):\n$$\nB(R_{EU}) = \\frac{1 + R_{EU}(1/R_{EU})(RR_{UD}^{\\text{max}}-1)}{1 + (1/R_{EU})(RR_{UD}^{\\text{max}}-1)} = \\frac{1 + (RR_{UD}^{\\text{max}}-1)}{1 + \\frac{RR_{UD}^{\\text{max}}-1}{R_{EU}}} = \\frac{RR_{UD}^{\\text{max}}}{1 + \\frac{RR_{UD}^{\\text{max}}-1}{R_{EU}}}\n$$\nTo maximize this expression, we must minimize the denominator. The denominator, $1 + \\frac{RR_{UD}^{\\text{max}}-1}{R_{EU}}$, decreases as $R_{EU}$ increases (since $RR_{UD}^{\\text{max}}-1 > 0$). Therefore, $B(R_{EU})$ is maximized at the largest value of $R_{EU}$, which is $R_{EU}^{\\text{max}} = 3$.\n\nThe maximal bias factor $B_{\\text{max}}$ is thus achieved at $RR_{UD} = 2.4$, $R_{EU} = 3$, and $p_0 = 1/R_{EU} = 1/3$.\nLet's calculate this value:\n$$\nB_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{1 + (3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3})(2.4 - 1)}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}(2.4 - 1)} = \\frac{1 + 1(1.4)}{1 + \\frac{1.4}{3}} = \\frac{2.4}{1 + \\frac{14}{30}} = \\frac{2.4}{\\frac{30+14}{30}} = \\frac{2.4}{\\frac{44}{30}} = \\frac{24}{10} \\cdot \\frac{30}{44} = \\frac{24 \\cdot 3}{44} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 3}{11} = \\frac{18}{11}\n$$\nThe relationship between the observed and true risk ratios is $RR_{\\text{obs}} = RR_{\\text{true}} \\cdot B$.\nSince the problem specifies that $U$ is more prevalent in the exposed ($R_{EU} \\ge 1$) and increases the outcome risk ($RR_{UD} \\ge 1$), the bias factor $B$ will be greater than or equal to $1$. This indicates that the unmeasured confounding has inflated the observed risk ratio.\nTo find the lower bound on $RR_{\\text{true}}$, we must correct for the largest possible inflation:\n$$\nRR_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{RR_{\\text{obs}}}{B}\n$$\nThe minimum value of $RR_{\\text{true}}$ corresponds to the maximum value of $B$:\n$$\nRR_{\\text{true, min}} = \\frac{RR_{\\text{obs}}}{B_{\\text{max}}}\n$$\nGiven $RR_{\\text{obs}} = 1.8$, we calculate the lower bound:\n$$\nRR_{\\text{true, min}} = \\frac{1.8}{18/11} = \\frac{18/10}{18/11} = \\frac{18}{10} \\cdot \\frac{11}{18} = \\frac{11}{10} = 1.1\n$$\nThis means that for the observed risk ratio of $1.8$ to be entirely explained by this confounder, the bias factor would need to be $1.8$. Our calculated maximum bias factor is $18/11 \\approx 1.636$, which is less than $1.8$. Therefore, even under the most extreme confounding scenario consistent with the evidence, the exposure $E$ must have some causal effect. The sharpest lower bound for this causal effect is $1.1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.1}\n$$", "id": "4639130"}]}
