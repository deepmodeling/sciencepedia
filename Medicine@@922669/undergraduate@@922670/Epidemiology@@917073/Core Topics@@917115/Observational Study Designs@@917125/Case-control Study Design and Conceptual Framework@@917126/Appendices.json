Mastering this procedure is a core skill for interpreting and reporting epidemiologic findings.", "problem": "A case-control study investigates the association between a binary exposure and a binary disease. Investigators enroll $N_{D} = a + c$ cases and $N_{\\bar{D}} = b + d$ controls, recording exposure status to form a two-by-two $2 \\times 2$ table with cell counts $a$ (exposed cases), $b$ (exposed controls), $c$ (unexposed cases), and $d$ (unexposed controls). Assume independent sampling of cases and controls, non-differential exposure measurement, and large-sample conditions under which the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the log odds ratio is asymptotically normal.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions of odds and odds ratio, where the odds of exposure among cases is $\\text{odds}_{D} = \\frac{P(E \\mid D)}{P(\\bar{E} \\mid D)}$ and the odds of exposure among controls is $\\text{odds}_{\\bar{D}} = \\frac{P(E \\mid \\bar{D})}{P(\\bar{E} \\mid \\bar{D})}$, the odds ratio (OR) is defined as $\\text{OR} = \\frac{\\text{odds}_{D}}{\\text{odds}_{\\bar{D}}}$.

The solution will proceed in three stages as requested: first, the derivation of the odds ratio estimator; second, the derivation of the large-sample variance for the logarithm of this estimator; and third, the construction of the confidence interval and calculation of its lower bound using the provided data.\n\nThe problem is validated as sound. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of epidemiology and biostatistics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objectively stated.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Odds Ratio Estimator**\n\nThe odds ratio is defined as the ratio of the odds of exposure among cases ($D$) to the odds of exposure among controls ($\\bar{D}$).\nLet $E$ denote exposure and $\\bar{E}$ denote non-exposure. The odds of exposure in the case group is:\n$$\n\\text{odds}_{D} = \\frac{P(E \\mid D)}{P(\\bar{E} \\mid D)} = \\frac{P(E \\mid D)}{1 - P(E \\mid D)}\n$$\nThe odds of exposure in the control group is:\n$$\n\\text{odds}_{\\bar{D}} = \\frac{P(E \\mid \\bar{D})}{P(\\bar{E} \\mid \\bar{D})} = \\frac{P(E \\mid \\bar{D})}{1 - P(E \\mid \\bar{D})}\n$$\nThe true odds ratio is the ratio of these two quantities:\n$$\n\\text{OR} = \\frac{\\text{odds}_{D}}{\\text{odds}_{\\bar{D}}}\n$$\nIn a case-control study, we sample a fixed number of cases, $N_{D} = a+c$, and a fixed number of controls, $N_{\\bar{D}} = b+d$. Within these samples, we can directly estimate the conditional probabilities of exposure. The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the probability of exposure given case status, $P(E \\mid D)$, is the sample proportion of exposed cases:\n$$\n\\hat{P}(E \\mid D) = \\frac{a}{a+c}\n$$\nSimilarly, the MLE for the probability of non-exposure given case status is:\n$$\n\\hat{P}(\\bar{E} \\mid D) = \\frac{c}{a+c}\n$$\nThe estimator for the odds of exposure among cases is therefore:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{odds}}_{D} = \\frac{\\hat{P}(E \\mid D)}{\\hat{P}(\\bar{E} \\mid D)} = \\frac{a / (a+c)}{c / (a+c)} = \\frac{a}{c}\n$$\nAnalogous logic applies to the control group:\n$$\n\\hat{P}(E \\mid \\bar{D}) = \\frac{b}{b+d} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\hat{P}(\\bar{E} \\mid \\bar{D}) = \\frac{d}{b+d}\n$$\nThe estimator for the odds of exposure among controls is:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{odds}}_{\\bar{D}} = \\frac{\\hat{P}(E \\mid \\bar{D})}{\\hat{P}(\\bar{E} \\mid \\bar{D})} = \\frac{b / (b+d)}{d / (b+d)} = \\frac{b}{d}\n$$\nThe estimator for the odds ratio, denoted $\\widehat{\\text{OR}}$, is the ratio of these estimated odds, commonly known as the cross-product ratio:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{OR}} = \\frac{\\widehat{\\text{odds}}_{D}}{\\widehat{\\text{odds}}_{\\bar{D}}} = \\frac{a/c}{b/d} = \\frac{ad}{bc}\n$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Large-Sample Variance of $\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$**\n\nThe distribution of $\\widehat{\\text{OR}}$ is typically skewed. However, its natural logarithm, $\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$, is approximately normally distributed for large sample sizes. Let $\\hat{\\theta} = \\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$.\n$$\n\\hat{\\theta} = \\log\\left(\\frac{ad}{bc}\\right) = \\log(a) + \\log(d) - \\log(b) - \\log(c)\n$$\nThe variance of $\\hat{\\theta}$ can be derived using the delta method. A standard result, known as the Woolf method, is that the large-sample approximation for the variance of $\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$ is the sum of the reciprocals of the cell counts. This can be justified by considering that under independent sampling of cases and controls, the counts of exposed subjects, $a$ and $b$, are independent binomial random variables: $a \\sim \\text{Bin}(N_D, p_1)$ and $b \\sim \\text{Bin}(N_{\\bar{D}}, p_2)$, where $p_1 = P(E|D)$ and $p_2 = P(E|\\bar{D})$. The quantity $\\hat{\\theta}$ can be written as $\\text{logit}(\\hat{p}_1) - \\text{logit}(\\hat{p}_2)$, where $\\hat{p}_1 = a/N_D$ and $\\hat{p}_2=b/N_{\\bar{D}}$.\nBy the delta method, the variance of the logit of a binomial proportion $\\hat{p} = k/n$ is approximately $\\frac{1}{np(1-p)}$. This is estimated by substituting observed counts, yielding $\\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{1}{n-k}$.\nApplying this to our independent samples:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\text{Var}(\\text{logit}(\\hat{p}_1)) + \\text{Var}(\\text{logit}(\\hat{p}_2)) \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{c}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{d}\\right)\n$$\nThus, the estimator for the variance of $\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$ is:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})) = \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{d}\n$$\n\n**3. Confidence Interval Construction and Calculation**\n\nUnder the large-sample assumption, the estimator $\\hat{\\theta} = \\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$ follows a normal distribution:\n$$\n\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}}) \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\log(\\text{OR}), \\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}}))\\right)\n$$\nThe standard error (SE) of $\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$ is the square root of its variance:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{SE}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{d}}\n$$\nA two-sided $100(1-\\alpha)\\%$ confidence interval for $\\log(\\text{OR})$ is constructed as:\n$$\n\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}}) \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\times \\widehat{\\text{SE}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}}))\n$$\nwhere $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the critical value from the standard normal distribution. For a $0.95$ confidence level, $\\alpha=0.05$, so $1-\\alpha/2 = 0.975$. The corresponding critical value is $z_{0.975} \\approx 1.96$.\n\nTo obtain the confidence interval for the $\\text{OR}$ itself, we exponentiate the lower and upper bounds of the interval for $\\log(\\text{OR})$. The lower limit for the $\\text{OR}$ is:\n$$\n\\text{LL}_{\\text{OR}} = \\exp\\left[\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}}) - z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\times \\widehat{\\text{SE}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}}))\\right]\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given cell counts: $a = 75$, $b = 30$, $c = 25$, and $d = 70$.\n\nFirst, calculate the point estimate $\\widehat{\\text{OR}}$:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{OR}} = \\frac{ad}{bc} = \\frac{75 \\times 70}{30 \\times 25} = \\frac{5250}{750} = 7\n$$\nNext, calculate the variance and standard error of $\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})) = \\frac{1}{75} + \\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{1}{25} + \\frac{1}{70}\n$$\nUsing a common denominator of $1050$:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})) = \\frac{14}{1050} + \\frac{35}{1050} + \\frac{42}{1050} + \\frac{15}{1050} = \\frac{14+35+42+15}{1050} = \\frac{106}{1050} = \\frac{53}{525}\n$$\nNumerically, $\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})) \\approx 0.10095238$.\nThe standard error is:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{SE}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{53}{525}} \\approx 0.3177300\n$$\nNow we construct the $0.95$ CI for $\\log(\\text{OR})$. The point estimate is $\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}}) = \\ln(7) \\approx 1.945910$.\nThe lower limit for $\\log(\\text{OR})$ is:\n$$\n\\text{LL}_{\\log(\\text{OR})} = \\ln(7) - 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{53}{525}} \\approx 1.945910 - 1.96 \\times 0.3177300 \\approx 1.945910 - 0.6227508 \\approx 1.3231592\n$$\nFinally, we compute the lower limit for the $\\text{OR}$ by exponentiating this value:\n$$\n\\text{LL}_{\\text{OR}} = \\exp(1.3231592) \\approx 3.75515\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the lower limit is $3.755$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.755}$$", "id": "4574844"}, {"introduction": "While the odds ratio ($OR$) is the natural measure derived from a case-control study, we often want to understand risk, which is more intuitively captured by the risk ratio ($RR$).

It contains no inconsistencies, ambiguities, or factual errors. The solution process may proceed.\n\nThe solution involves three parts as requested: deriving the functional relationship for the risk ratio ($RR$), calculating the numerical difference $OR - RR$, and evaluating a specified criterion for the rare disease assumption.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of RR as a function of OR and $P_0$**\n\nWe begin with the definition of the odds ratio ($OR$):\n$$ OR = \\frac{P_1 / (1 - P_1)}{P_0 / (1 - P_0)} $$\nOur objective is to express $RR = P_1/P_0$ in terms of $OR$ and $P_0$. To do this, we must first solve for $P_1$. We rearrange the $OR$ equation to isolate the odds of disease in the exposed group, $P_1 / (1 - P_1)$:\n$$ \\frac{P_1}{1 - P_1} = OR \\cdot \\left( \\frac{P_0}{1 - P_0} \\right) $$\nLet the right-hand side be denoted by $K$ for algebraic simplicity, $K = OR \\cdot \\frac{P_0}{1 - P_0}$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{P_1}{1 - P_1} = K $$\nWe now solve for $P_1$:\n$$ P_1 = K(1 - P_1) $$\n$$ P_1 = K - K \\cdot P_1 $$\n$$ P_1 + K \\cdot P_1 = K $$\n$$ P_1(1 + K) = K $$\n$$ P_1 = \\frac{K}{1 + K} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $K$ back into this equation:\n$$ P_1 = \\frac{OR \\cdot \\frac{P_0}{1 - P_0}}{1 + OR \\cdot \\frac{P_0}{1 - P_0}} $$\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $(1 - P_0)$:\n$$ P_1 = \\frac{OR \\cdot P_0}{(1 - P_0) + OR \\cdot P_0} $$\nNow, we use the definition of the risk ratio, $RR = P_1 / P_0$:\n$$ RR = \\frac{1}{P_0} \\left( \\frac{OR \\cdot P_0}{1 - P_0 + OR \\cdot P_0} \\right) $$\nThe term $P_0$ cancels out, yielding the desired relationship:\n$$ RR = \\frac{OR}{1 - P_0 + OR \\cdot P_0} $$\nThis expression can be rearranged to highlight the role of $P_0$ in the deviation of $RR$ from $OR$:\n$$ RR = \\frac{OR}{1 + P_0(OR - 1)} $$\nThis is the required relationship for $RR$ as a function of $OR$ and $P_0$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the numerical difference $OR - RR$**\n\nWe are given $OR = 1.8$ and $P_0 = 0.03$.
