This first exercise provides a foundational model to quantify the effect of nondifferential misclassification—where the error rate is the same for cases and controls—on a binary exposure. By calculating the biased odds ratio from observed data and then working backward to recover the true measure of association, you will gain a concrete understanding of how this common type of error typically attenuates a true effect, biasing it toward the null value of 1.0 [@problem_id:4593450].", "problem": "A case-control study investigates the association between an agricultural pesticide exposure and a neurodegenerative disease. Suppose the true exposure classification is known from a gold standard for a subset of data, yielding the following true counts in a two-by-two table: among cases, the truly exposed count is $120$ and the truly unexposed count is $80$; among controls, the truly exposed count is $60$ and the truly unexposed count is $140$. Due to cost constraints, the main study uses a less accurate exposure ascertainment method with sensitivity $Se=0.80$ and specificity $Sp=0.90$, applied identically to cases and controls. Assume nondifferential, independent misclassification of exposure such that the probability model for exposure classification is the same in cases and controls, and that the expected observed counts follow from the definitions of sensitivity and specificity and the law of total probability.\n\nUsing only the foundational definitions of sensitivity and specificity for binary classification and the definition of the odds ratio, carry out the following steps:\n\n1. Derive the expected observed counts in each of the four cells of the two-by-two table when the imperfect exposure ascertainment replaces the gold standard. Explicitly compute the expected observed counts for exposed and unexposed among cases, and exposed and unexposed among controls.\n\n2. Compute the observed odds ratio $OR_{obs}$ based on the expected observed counts.\n\n3. Reverse the calculation: set up and solve the system implied by sensitivity and specificity to recover the true counts from the observed counts, and then compute the corrected true odds ratio $OR_{true}$.\n\nReport both odds ratios in the order $\\left(OR_{obs}, OR_{true}\\right)$ as exact fractions. Do not round.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in epidemiological principles, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated.\n\nWe begin by formalizing the provided information. Let $D^+$ denote the cases (individuals with the disease) and $D^-$ denote the controls (individuals without the disease). Let $E^+$ and $E^-$ denote true exposure status (exposed and unexposed), and let $e^+$ and $e^-$ denote the observed exposure status from the imperfect test.\n\nThe true counts are given as:\n- Number of truly exposed cases: $A_1 = 120$\n- Number of truly unexposed cases: $B_1 = 80$\n- Total number of cases: $N_1 = A_1 + B_1 = 120 + 80 = 200$\n- Number of truly exposed controls: $A_0 = 60$\n- Number of truly unexposed controls: $B_0 = 140$\n- Total number of controls: $N_0 = A_0 + B_0 = 60 + 140 = 200$\n\nThe properties of the exposure ascertainment method are given by its sensitivity ($Se$) and specificity ($Sp$):\n- Sensitivity, $Se = P(e^+|E^+) = 0.80$. This is the probability that a truly exposed individual is classified as exposed.\n- Specificity, $Sp = P(e^-|E^-) = 0.90$. This is the probability that a truly unexposed individual is classified as unexposed.\n\nFrom these definitions, we can derive the probabilities of misclassification:\n- False negative rate: $P(e^-|E^+) = 1 - Se = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$\n- False positive rate: $P(e^+|E^-) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$\n\nThe problem assumes nondifferential misclassification, meaning $Se$ and $Sp$ are the same for cases and controls.\n\n### 1. Derivation of Expected Observed Counts\n\nWe compute the expected counts for the observed two-by-two table, denoted by $a_1$ (observed exposed cases), $b_1$ (observed unexposed cases), $a_0$ (observed exposed controls), and $b_0$ (observed unexposed controls).\n\nThe number of observed exposed cases, $a_1$, is the sum of truly exposed cases correctly classified and truly unexposed cases incorrectly classified:\n$$a_1 = A_1 \\times Se + B_1 \\times (1 - Sp)$$\n$$a_1 = 120 \\times 0.80 + 80 \\times (1 - 0.90) = 96 + 8 = 104$$\n\nThe number of observed unexposed cases, $b_1$, is the sum of truly unexposed cases correctly classified and truly exposed cases incorrectly classified:\n$$b_1 = B_1 \\times Sp + A_1 \\times (1 - Se)$$\n$$b_1 = 80 \\times 0.90 + 120 \\times (1 - 0.80) = 72 + 24 = 96$$\nAs a check, the total number of cases must be conserved: $a_1 + b_1 = 104 + 96 = 200 = N_1$.\n\nSimilarly, for the control group:\nThe number of observed exposed controls, $a_0$:\n$$a_0 = A_0 \\times Se + B_0 \\times (1 - Sp)$$\n$$a_0 = 60 \\times 0.80 + 140 \\times (1 - 0.90) = 48 + 14 = 62$$\n\nThe number of observed unexposed controls, $b_0$:\n$$b_0 = B_0 \\times Sp + A_0 \\times (1 - Se)$$\n$$b_0 = 140 \\times 0.90 + 60 \\times (1 - 0.80) = 126 + 12 = 138$$\nAs a check, the total number of controls must be conserved: $a_0 + b_0 = 62 + 138 = 200 = N_0$.\n\nThus, the expected observed counts are: $a_1 = 104$, $b_1 = 96$, $a_0 = 62$, $b_0 = 138$.\n\n### 2. Computation of the Observed Odds Ratio ($OR_{obs}$)\n\nThe odds ratio is defined as the ratio of the odds of exposure in the cases to the odds of exposure in the controls. Using the observed counts:\n$$OR_{obs} = \\frac{\\text{odds of exposure in cases}}{\\text{odds of exposure in controls}} = \\frac{a_1 / b_1}{a_0 / b_0} = \\frac{a_1 b_0}{a_0 b_1}$$\nSubstituting the computed values:\n$$OR_{obs} = \\frac{104 \\times 138}{62 \\times 96}$$\nTo simplify this fraction:\n$$OR_{obs} = \\frac{(8 \\times 13) \\times (6 \\times 23)}{(2 \\times 31) \\times (8 \\times 12)} = \\frac{13 \\times 6 \\times 23}{2 \\times 31 \\times 12} = \\frac{13 \\times 23}{31 \\times 4} = \\frac{299}{124}$$\n\n### 3. Recovery of True Counts and Computation of the True Odds Ratio ($OR_{true}$)\n\nFirst, we calculate the true odds ratio ($OR_{true}$) directly from the given true counts as a reference:\n$$OR_{true} = \\frac{A_1 B_0}{A_0 B_1} = \\frac{120 \\times 140}{60 \\times 80} = \\frac{2 \\times 140}{80} = \\frac{280}{80} = \\frac{28}{8} = \\frac{7}{2}$$\n\nNow, we perform the reverse calculation as requested, solving for the true counts ($A_1, B_1, A_0, B_0$) using the observed counts ($a_1, b_1, a_0, b_0$) and the test parameters ($Se, Sp$).\n\nFor the cases, we have the system of equations:\n$$a_1 = A_1 \\cdot Se + B_1 \\cdot (1 - Sp)$$\n$$A_1 + B_1 = N_1 = a_1 + b_1 = 200$$\nSubstitute $B_1 = 200 - A_1$ into the first equation:\n$$104 = A_1 \\cdot (0.80) + (200 - A_1) \\cdot (0.10)$$\n$$104 = 0.80 A_1 + 20 - 0.10 A_1$$\n$$84 = 0.70 A_1$$\n$$A_1 = \\frac{84}{0.7} = 120$$\nThen, $B_1 = 200 - A_1 = 200 - 120 = 80$. These recovered counts match the true counts provided in the problem.\n\nFor the controls, we have a similar system:\n$$a_0 = A_0 \\cdot Se + B_0 \\cdot (1 - Sp)$$\n$$A_0 + B_0 = N_0 = a_0 + b_0 = 200$$\nSubstitute $B_0 = 200 - A_0$:\n$$62 = A_0 \\cdot (0.80) + (200 - A_0) \\cdot (0.10)$$\n$$62 = 0.80 A_0 + 20 - 0.10 A_0$$\n$$42 = 0.70 A_0$$\n$$A_0 = \\frac{42}{0.7} = 60$$\nThen, $B_0 = 200 - A_0 = 200 - 60 = 140$. These also match the true counts.\n\nUsing these recovered \"true\" counts, we compute the corrected true odds ratio, which must be identical to the one computed from the initial problem data:\n$$OR_{true} = \\frac{A_1 B_0}{A_0 B_1} = \\frac{120 \\times 140}{60 \\times 80} = \\frac{7}{2}$$\n\nThe nondifferential misclassification of exposure has resulted in an observed odds ratio ($OR_{obs} = 299/124 \\approx 2.41$) that is biased toward the null value of $1$ compared to the true odds ratio ($OR_{true} = 7/2 = 3.5$).\n\nThe required values are $OR_{obs}$ and $OR_{true}$ as exact fractions.\n$OR_{obs} = \\frac{299}{124}$\n$OR_{true} = \\frac{7}{2}$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{299}{124} & \\frac{7}{2} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4593450"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basic principles, this next practice introduces a more powerful and generalizable tool for correcting misclassification: matrix algebra.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is structured according to the three tasks outlined in the problem statement.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the Misclassification Matrix $M_d$**\n\nLet $d \\in \\{\\text{case}, \\text{control}\\}$ be the disease stratum. Within each stratum, the observed counts are functions of the true counts and the misclassification probabilities. Let $T_{1,d}$ and $T_{0,d}$ be the true number of exposed and unexposed individuals, respectively.\n\nThe number of individuals observed as exposed, $O_{1,d}$, consists of two groups: truly exposed individuals who are correctly classified (true positives) and truly unexposed individuals who are incorrectly classified (false positives).\n- Number of true positives = $T_{1,d} \\times P(O=1 \\mid E=1, d) = T_{1,d} \\cdot Se_d$.\n- Number of false positives = $T_{0,d} \\times P(O=1 \\mid E=0, d) = T_{0,d} \\times (1 - P(O=0 \\mid E=0, d)) = T_{0,d} \\cdot (1-Sp_d)$.\nThus, the total observed exposed count is:\n$$O_{1,d} = T_{1,d} \\cdot Se_d + T_{0,d} \\cdot (1-Sp_d)$$\n\nSimilarly, the number of individuals observed as unexposed, $O_{0,d}$, consists of truly exposed individuals who are incorrectly classified (false negatives) and truly unexposed individuals who are correctly classified (true negatives).\n- Number of false negatives = $T_{1,d} \\times P(O=0 \\mid E=1, d) = T_{1,d} \\times (1 - P(O=1 \\mid E=1, d)) = T_{1,d} \\cdot (1-Se_d)$.\n- Number of true negatives = $T_{0,d} \\times P(O=0 \\mid E=0, d) = T_{0,d} \\cdot Sp_d$.\nThus, the total observed unexposed count is:\n$$O_{0,d} = T_{1,d} \\cdot (1-Se_d) + T_{0,d} \\cdot Sp_d$$\n\nThese two linear equations can be expressed in matrix form as $\\mathbf{O}_d = M_d \\mathbf{T}_d$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} O_{1,d} \\\\ O_{0,d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} Se_d & 1-Sp_d \\\\ 1-Se_d & Sp_d \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} T_{1,d} \\\\ T_{0,d} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTherefore, the $2 \\times 2$ misclassification matrix $M_d$ that maps true exposure counts to observed exposure counts is:\n$$\nM_d = \\begin{pmatrix} Se_d & 1-Sp_d \\\\ 1-Se_d & Sp_d \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**Task 2: Derivation of the Inverse Matrix $M_d^{-1}$ and Correction Mapping**\n\nTo find the true counts $\\mathbf{T}_d$ from the observed counts $\\mathbf{O}_d$, we must invert the matrix $M_d$.

The principle of nondifferential misclassification dictates that these probabilities, $P(E^*=i | E=j)$, are identical for cases and controls.\n\nThe number of individuals observed in a given exposure category $E^*=i$, denoted $N^*(E^*=i)$, is the sum over all true exposure categories $E=j$ of the number of individuals truly in category $j$, $N(E=j)$, multiplied by the probability of being classified as $i$ given a true state of $j$.\n$$N^*(E^*=i) = \\sum_{j \\in \\{0,1,2\\}} N(E=j) \\cdot P(E^*=i | E=j)$$\n\nThe given true counts for the $600$ cases are:\n$N_{\\text{case}}(E=0) = 250$\n$N_{\\text{case}}(E=1) = 150$\n$N_{\\text{case}}(E=2) = 200$\n\nThe given true counts for the $600$ controls are:\n$N_{\\text{control}}(E=0) = 340$\n$N_{\\text{control}}(E=1) = 240$\n$N_{\\text{control}}(E=2) = 20$\n\nThe classification probabilities $P(E^*=i|E=j)$ are provided as:\n- For $E=0$: $P(E^*=0|E=0) = 0.95$, $P(E^*=1|E=0) = 0.05$, $P(E^*=2|E=0) = 0$.\n- For $E=1$: $P(E^*=0|E=1) = 0.10$, $P(E^*=1|E=1) = 0.90$, $P(E^*=2|E=1) = 0$.\n- For $E=2$: $P(E^*=0|E=2) = 0$, $P(E^*=1|E=2) = 0.80$, $P(E^*=2|E=2) = 0.20$.\n\nWe need to compute the observed counts for $E^*=0$ and $E^*=1$ to calculate the specified odds ratio.\n\nFor the cases:\nThe observed number of cases classified as $E^*=0$ is:\n$$N^*_{\\text{case}}(E^*=0) = N_{\\text{case}}(E=0)P(E^*=0|E=0) + N_{\\text{case}}(E=1)P(E^*=0|E=1) + N_{\\text{case}}(E=2)P(E^*=0|E=2)$$\n$$N^*_{\\text{case}}(E^*=0) = (250)(0.95) + (150)(0.10) + (200)(0) = 237.5 + 15 + 0 = 252.5$$\nThe observed number of cases classified as $E^*=1$ is:\n$$N^*_{\\text{case}}(E^*=1) = N_{\\text{case}}(E=0)P(E^*=1|E=0) + N_{\\text{case}}(E=1)P(E^*=1|E=1) + N_{\\text{case}}(E=2)P(E^*=1|E=2)$$\n$$N^*_{\\text{case}}(E^*=1) = (250)(0.05) + (150)(0.90) + (200)(0.80) = 12.5 + 135 + 160 = 307.5$$\n\nFor the controls:\nThe observed number of controls classified as $E^*=0$ is:\n$$N^*_{\\text{control}}(E^*=0) = N_{\\text{control}}(E=0)P(E^*=0|E=0) + N_{\\text{control}}(E=1)P(E^*=0|E=1) + N_{\\text{control}}(E=2)P(E^*=0|E=2)$$\n$$N^*_{\\text{control}}(E^*=0) = (340)(0.95) + (240)(0.10) + (20)(0) = 323 + 24 + 0 = 347$$\nThe observed number of controls classified as $E^*=1$ is:\n$$N^*_{\\text{control}}(E^*=1) = N_{\\text{control}}(E=0)P(E^*=1|E=0) + N_{\\text{control}}(E=1)P(E^*=1|E=1) + N_{\\text{control}}(E=2)P(E^*=1|E=2)$$\n$$N^*_{\\text{control}}(E^*=1) = (340)(0.05) + (240)(0.90) + (20)(0.80) = 17 + 216 + 16 = 249$$\n\nThe odds ratio ($OR$) is defined as the ratio of the odds of exposure in cases to the odds of exposure in controls. For the observed association comparing $E^*=1$ versus $E^*=0$, the odds are calculated with respect to these two categories.\nThe odds of observed exposure $E^*=1$ among cases is:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text{case}} = \\frac{N^*_{\\text{case}}(E^*=1)}{N^*_{\\text{case}}(E^*=0)}$$\nThe odds of observed exposure $E^*=1$ among controls is:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text{control}} = \\frac{N^*_{\\text{control}}(E^*=1)}{N^*_{\\text{control}}(E^*=0)}$$\nThe observed odds ratio, $OR_{obs}$, is the ratio of these odds, which is equivalent to the cross-product ratio of the counts in a $2 \\times 2$ table for exposure levels $0$ and $1$:\n$$OR_{obs} = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{case}}}{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{control}}} = \\frac{N^*_{\\text{case}}(E^*=1) / N^*_{\\text{case}}(E^*=0)}{N^*_{\\text{control}}(E^*=1) / N^*_{\\text{control}}(E^*=0)} = \\frac{N^*_{\\text{case}}(E^*=1) \\cdot N^*_{\\text{control}}(E^*=0)}{N^*_{\\text{case}}(E^*=0) \\cdot N^*_{\\text{control}}(E^*=1)}$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated observed counts:\n$$OR_{obs} = \\frac{(307.5) \\cdot (347)}{(252.5) \\cdot (249)}$$\n$$OR_{obs} = \\frac{106702.5}{62872.5} \\approx 1.697112009$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1.697$. The fifth digit is $1$, so we round down.\nThe final result is $1.697$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.697}$$", "id": "4593432"}]}
