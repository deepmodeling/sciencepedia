We use the notation $D=1$ for the presence of the disease and $D=0$ for its absence.

This provides a pooled estimate that is adjusted for the confounding effects of the stratifying variable.\n\nThe Mantel-Haenszel estimator for the common odds ratio, $OR_{MH}$, for $k$ strata is given by the formula:\n$$ OR_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{a_i d_i}{N_i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{b_i c_i}{N_i}} $$\nwhere $N_i = a_i + b_i + c_i + d_i$ is the total number of subjects in stratum $i$.\n\nNow, we compute this value for the given data ($k=2$).\nFirst, calculate the total size $N_i$ for each stratum:\nFor Stratum $1$: $N_1 = 120 + 90 + 80 + 210 = 500$.\nFor Stratum $2$: $N_2 = 60 + 40 + 140 + 260 = 500$.\n\nNext, calculate the weighted components for the numerator and denominator sums:\nFor Stratum $1$:\nNumerator component: $\\frac{a_1 d_1}{N_1} = \\frac{120 \\times 210}{500} = \\frac{25200}{500} = 50.4$.\nDenominator component: $\\frac{b_1 c_1}{N_1} = \\frac{90 \\times 80}{500} = \\frac{7200}{500} = 14.4$.\n\nFor Stratum $2$:\nNumerator component: $\\frac{a_2 d_2}{N_2} = \\frac{60 \\times 260}{500} = \\frac{15600}{500} = 31.2$.\nDenominator component: $\\frac{b_2 c_2}{N_2} = \\frac{40 \\times 140}{500} = \\frac{5600}{500} = 11.2$.\n\nFinally, compute the pooled odds ratio by summing these components:\n$$ OR_{MH} = \\frac{50.4 + 31.2}{14.4 + 11.2} = \\frac{81.6}{25.6} = 3.1875 $$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, the result is $3.188$.\n\n**Discussion of Conditions for Pooling**\n\nThe appropriateness of pooling stratum-specific estimates into a single summary measure, such as the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio, rests on fundamental principles of confounding control and the absence of effect modification.\n\n1.  **Homogeneity of the Odds Ratio (Absence of Effect Modification):** The most critical assumption for pooling is that the odds ratio is constant, or homogeneous, across all strata. The stratifying variable should not be an \"effect modifier.\" Effect modification (or interaction) is present when the magnitude or direction of the association between the exposure and the disease differs across levels of the stratifying variable. If the stratum-specific odds ratios (e.g., $OR_1$ and $OR_2$) are meaningfully different, pooling the estimates into a single number would be scientifically invalid and misleading, as it would obscure this important finding. The appropriate action is to report the stratum-specific odds ratios separately. Formal statistical tests, such as the Breslow-Day test, can be used to assess this homogeneity assumption.\n\n2.  **Control of Confounding:** The primary purpose of stratification and pooling is to control for confounding. A confounder is a variable associated with both the exposure and the outcome that can distort the apparent relationship between them. By calculating the odds ratio within each stratum of the confounder, its effect is held constant. The pooled estimator, $OR_{MH}$, provides a summary measure of association that is statistically adjusted for the effect of the confounder. For this problem, combining all data yields a crude odds ratio of approximately $2.96$, which is different from the stratum-specific ORs ($3.5$ and $\\approx 2.79$) and the pooled OR ($3.188$), indicating the presence of confounding by the stratifying variable. Therefore, presenting an adjusted estimate is necessary.\n\nIn summary, pooling is appropriate to obtain a single, adjusted measure of association in the presence of confounding, but only when the assumption of a homogeneous effect across strata is tenable.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.188}$$", "id": "4638789"}]}
