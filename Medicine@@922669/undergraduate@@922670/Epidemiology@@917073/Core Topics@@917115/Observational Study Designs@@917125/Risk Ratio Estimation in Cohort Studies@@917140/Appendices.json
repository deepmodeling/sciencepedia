It presents a standard scenario in epidemiology involving a cohort study and the calculation of a risk ratio ($RR$). All provided data are internally consistent and sufficient for a complete analysis. The question posed is clear and addresses a fundamental concept in the interpretation of relative effect measures.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by first principles.\n\nThe risk, defined as cumulative incidence, for each group is calculated as follows:\n- For the exposed group ($E$): $N_E = 1,000$ workers, $I_E = 80$ incident cases. The risk is $R_E = \\frac{I_E}{N_E} = \\frac{80}{1,000} = 0.08$.\n- For the unexposed group ($U$): $N_U = 1,200$ workers, $I_U = 60$ incident cases. The risk is $R_U = \\frac{I_U}{N_U} = \\frac{60}{1,200} = 0.05$.\n\nThe risk ratio ($RR$) is the ratio of the risk in one group to the risk in a reference group. The choice of the reference group determines the specific value of the $RR$.\n\nCase 1: Investigator 1 reports the risk ratio of \"$E$ versus $U$\". This implies that group $U$ is the reference category.\n$$RR_{E \\text{ vs } U} = \\frac{R_E}{R_U} = \\frac{0.08}{0.05} = 1.60$$\nThis value matches the one reported in the problem statement.\n\nCase 2: Investigator 2 reports the risk ratio of \"$U$ versus $E$\". This implies that group $E$ is the reference category.\n$$RR_{U \\text{ vs } E} = \\frac{R_U}{R_E} = \\frac{0.05}{0.08} = 0.625$$\nThis value also matches the one reported in the problem statement.\n\nThe mathematical relationship between these two risk ratios is:\n$$RR_{U \\text{ vs } E} = \\frac{R_U}{R_E} = \\frac{1}{R_E/R_U} = \\frac{1}{RR_{E \\text{ vs } U}}$$\nNumerically, $\\frac{1}{1.60} = 0.625$. The two reported values are reciprocals of each other. This is a direct consequence of reversing the roles of the numerator and the denominator, which corresponds to swapping the group of interest and the reference group.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\nA. The two reported risk ratios are reciprocals because swapping the reference category inverts the $RR$. A clear convention is to define $RR$ with the exposure of primary interest in the numerator and to state the comparison explicitly (e.g., “risk in $E$ divided by risk in $U$”), so that when $RR1$ it indicates higher risk in the exposed group; here, $RR_{E \\text{ vs } U}=1.60$ means the risk in $E$ is $60\\%$ higher than in $U$.\nThis statement is entirely accurate.\n- It correctly identifies the reciprocal relationship between the two $RR$ values ($1.60$ and $0.625$).\n- It correctly attributes this relationship to swapping the reference category.\n- It correctly describes the standard epidemiological convention: place the risk of the group of primary interest (usually the exposed group) in the numerator, so that an $RR  1$ represents an increased risk associated with the exposure, and an $RR  1$ represents a decreased risk (protective effect).\n- It correctly interprets $RR = 1.60$. The percent increase in risk is calculated as $(RR - 1) \\times 100\\% = (1.60 - 1) \\times 100\\% = 60\\%$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. The risk ratios differ because the group sizes are unequal, not because of the reference choice; to avoid confusion, always report the absolute risk difference, which is $0.03$ here, instead of $RR$.\nThis statement is incorrect. The primary reason the two values ($1.60$ and $0.625$) differ from each other is the choice of the reference category, which leads to a reciprocal relationship. While the group sizes ($N_E$ and $N_U$) influence the specific risk values ($R_E$ and $R_U$) and thus the $RR$, they are not the cause of the mathematical inversion. If the group sizes were equal, say $N_E=N_U=1,000$, the risks would be $R_E=0.08$ and $R_U=0.06$ (with $I_U=60$), leading to $RR_{E \\text{ vs } U} \\approx 1.33$ and $RR_{U \\text{ vs } E} \\approx 0.75$, which are still reciprocals. The suggestion to replace the relative measure ($RR$) with an absolute measure (risk difference, $RD = R_E - R_U = 0.08 - 0.05 = 0.03$) is a false dichotomy. Both measures are useful and provide different types of information; one does not simply replace the other to \"avoid confusion.\"\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. The reported values should be averaged to obtain a single, reference-free $RR$; to avoid confusion, report the mean of $1.60$ and $0.625$, which is $1.1125$, because it is closer to $1$ and less likely to mislead.\nThis statement is nonsensical from a mathematical and epidemiological perspective. The arithmetic mean of a value and its reciprocal, $(\\frac{R_E}{R_U} + \\frac{R_U}{R_E})/2$, has no meaningful interpretation as a measure of association. The concept of a \"reference-free\" risk ratio is an oxymoron, as the measure is inherently a comparison relative to a reference. The justification that the averaged value is \"closer to $1$\" is fallacious; the goal of scientific reporting is accuracy and clarity, not generating values that appear closer to the null.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. The risk ratio is symmetric with respect to the reference category, so the two values should have been identical; to avoid confusion, only report $RR$ when it exceeds $1$ and convert any value below $1$ to $1-RR$ as a “relative risk reduction.”\nThis statement begins with a fundamentally false premise. A ratio $a/b$ is not symmetric; it does not equal $b/a$ unless $a = b$ (in which case the ratio is $1$). Therefore, the risk ratio is inherently asymmetric with respect to the reference category. The two values, $1.60$ and $0.625$, are correctly different. The risk difference exhibits antisymmetry ($R_E - R_U = -(R_U - R_E)$), but the risk ratio does not. The suggested reporting convention is also problematic and not standard practice, as it would involve selectively withholding information. While relative risk reduction ($RRR = 1 - RR$ for $RR1$) is a valid concept, it does not salvage the initial incorrect assertion of symmetry.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4632241"}, {"introduction": "In the real world, the relationship between an exposure and an outcome is rarely simple; other factors, known as confounders, can distort this relationship.

This indicates that age group ($C$) does not modify the effect of the solvent exposure on the relative risk scale. The common stratum-specific risk ratio is $2$.\n\n**Part 2: Crude Risk Ratio ($RR_{\\text{crude}}$)**\n\nTo compute the crude risk ratio, we first collapse the data across the two strata.\nTotal number of exposed workers:\n$$ N_E = n_{E,0} + n_{E,1} = 900 + 100 = 1,000 $$\nTotal number of outcomes in the exposed group:\n$$ A = a_0 + a_1 = 90 + 80 = 170 $$\nTotal number of unexposed workers:\n$$ N_U = n_{U,0} + n_{U,1} = 100 + 900 = 1,000 $$\nTotal number of outcomes in the unexposed group:\n$$ C_{\\text{total}} = c_0 + c_1 = 5 + 360 = 365 $$\n\nThe crude risk in the total exposed group is:\n$$ R_{E, \\text{crude}} = \\frac{A}{N_E} = \\frac{170}{1,000} $$\nThe crude risk in the total unexposed group is:\n$$ R_{U, \\text{crude}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{total}}}{N_U} = \\frac{365}{1,000} $$\nThe crude risk ratio is:\n$$ RR_{\\text{crude}} = \\frac{R_{E, \\text{crude}}}{R_{U, \\text{crude}}} = \\frac{170/1,000}{365/1,000} = \\frac{170}{365} $$\nTo simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor of $170$ and $365$. Both numbers are divisible by $5$:\n$$ RR_{\\text{crude}} = \\frac{170 \\div 5}{365 \\div 5} = \\frac{34}{73} $$\n\n**Part 3: Explanation of Discrepancy and Condition for Collapsibility**\n\nThe crude risk ratio ($RR_{\\text{crude}} = 34/73 \\approx 0.47$) is markedly different from the uniform stratum-specific risk ratio ($RR_0 = RR_1 = 2$). This discrepancy, known as confounding, occurs because the covariate, age group ($C$), is a confounder. A variable is a confounder if it satisfies three conditions:\n1. It is associated with the exposure.\n2. It is an independent risk factor for the outcome.\n3. It does not lie on the causal pathway between the exposure and the outcome.\n\nLet's verify the first two conditions with the given data.\n1.  **Association between Age ($C$) and Exposure:** The distribution of age differs between the exposed and unexposed groups.\n    -   Proportion of exposed workers who are young ($C=0$): $\\frac{n_{E,0}}{N_E} = \\frac{900}{1,000} = 0.9$ or $90\\%$.\n    -   Proportion of unexposed workers who are young ($C=0$): $\\frac{n_{U,0}}{N_U} = \\frac{100}{1,000} = 0.1$ or $10\\%$.\n    Since these proportions are unequal, age is strongly associated with the solvent exposure.\n\n2.  **Association between Age ($C$) and Outcome:** Age is an independent risk factor for the respiratory outcome. We can see this by comparing the risk of the outcome in older versus younger workers within the unexposed group (i.e., in the absence of the exposure of interest).\n    -   Risk in unexposed younger workers: $R_{U,0} = 1/20 = 0.05$ or $5\\%$.\n    -   Risk in unexposed older workers: $R_{U,1} = 2/5 = 0.40$ or $40\\%$.\n    The baseline risk is much higher in the older group, so age is a strong risk factor for the outcome.\n\nThe crude calculation is a weighted average of the stratum-specific risks, but the weights are distorted by the confounding. The crude analysis compares a predominantly young ($90\\%$) exposed group to a predominantly old ($90\\%$) unexposed group. Because the older group has a much higher background risk ($40\\%$) than the younger group ($5\\%$), the risk in the crude unexposed group is artificially inflated. This makes the solvent exposure appear protective ($RR_{\\text{crude}}  1$), when in fact it is harmful ($RR=2$) within each age group. This reversal of association is an example of Simpson's Paradox.\n\nThe condition under which the risk ratio is collapsible across strata of a covariate $C$ (i.e., $RR_{\\text{crude}}$ equals the common stratum-specific $RR$) is that $C$ is not a confounder. In the absence of effect modification (as is the case here, since $RR_0=RR_1$), this means that at least one of the two conditions for confounding must be violated. Specifically, the risk ratio is collapsible if:\n- The distribution of the covariate $C$ is the same in the exposed and unexposed groups (i.e., $C$ is not associated with the exposure).\n_or_\n- The covariate $C$ is not a risk factor for the outcome in the unexposed group (i.e., the risk of the outcome is constant across strata of $C$ among the unexposed).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2  \\frac{34}{73} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4632256"}, {"introduction": "A challenging issue in cohort studies arises when exposure can occur at any time during follow-up, which can lead to a subtle but powerful 'immortal time' bias.

It describes a classic scenario in pharmacoepidemiology designed to assess understanding of immortal time bias and a standard method for its correction (emulation of a target trial). The data provided are sufficient and plausible for the required calculations. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is provided below.\n\n### Task A: Conceptual Explanation of Immortal Time Bias\n\nImmortal time bias is a form of misclassification bias that arises in observational studies when the classification of exposure is based on an event that occurs at some point after the start of follow-up. The time span between the start of follow-up (time zero) and the exposure-defining event is the \"immortal time.\" For a subject to be classified as exposed, they must necessarily survive this immortal period. A naive analysis that fails to account for this guaranteed survival period incorrectly credits it to the exposed group's follow-up time, leading to a biased estimate of the exposure's effect.\n\nIn this problem, the exposure is defined as initiating Drug X between day $5$ and day $20$ post-discharge. The feature of the exposure definition that generates the bias is its **time-varying nature being treated as a fixed baseline characteristic**. A patient who initiates Drug X on day $20$ must, by definition, have been alive and event-free (not dead) for the first $20$ days of the study. This $20$-day period is their immortal time. Any patient who died before their potential initiation day (e.g., on day $10$) would be classified as unexposed, even if they might have started the drug on day $15$ had they survived.\n\nA naive analysis that classifies the cohort at baseline (day $0$) into \"ever-initiators\" and \"never-initiators\" misattributes this immortal time. For an individual who initiates on day $t_{init}$, the period from day $0$ to day $t_{init}$ is incorrectly included in the follow-up time for the exposed group. During this period, the risk of death for that individual, *conditional on them being in the exposed group*, is zero. This artificially lowers the calculated risk (cumulative incidence) for the exposed group because their observed number of deaths is divided by a group size that implicitly includes members during periods when they could not have died and been so classified.\n\nThe problem defines the risk ratio as $RR = \\frac{\\text{Risk}_{\\text{unexposed}}}{\\text{Risk}_{\\text{exposed}}}$. Since immortal time bias artificially decreases $\\text{Risk}_{\\text{exposed}}$, the denominator of this fraction becomes smaller than its true value. A smaller denominator results in a larger quotient, thereby artificially **inflating** the risk ratio. This can lead to the fallacious conclusion that the drug is strongly protective (i.e., that the risk of death in the unexposed group is much higher than in the exposed group).\n\n### Task B: Scenario Analysis and Design-Based Fix\n\nIn the naive analysis, a cohort of $4,000$ patients is split at baseline (day $0$) into two fixed groups: a group of $1,200$ patients who will eventually initiate Drug X by day $20$, and a group of $2,800$ patients who will not. The $60$-day risk of death is then compared.\n\nImmortal time bias operates here by skewing the composition and apparent risk of both groups. The group of $1,200$ \"exposed\" patients is guaranteed to have zero deaths before their respective initiation days (which occur between day $5$ and day $20$). For example, a patient starting the drug on day $20$ survived for $20$ days, and a patient starting on day $5$ survived for $5$ days. These periods of guaranteed survival are fallaciously included in the risk period for the exposed group. Conversely, any patient who might have initiated the drug but died before doing so (e.g., on day $4$) is automatically classified into the \"unexposed\" group. This systematically removes early deaths from the exposed group and places them into the unexposed group, simultaneously decreasing the numerator (deaths) for the exposed group (relative to the time at risk) and increasing the numerator for the unexposed group. This artifactually lowers the risk in the exposed group, making the drug appear protective and inflating the defined risk ratio, $RR = \\frac{\\text{Risk}_{\\text{unexposed}}}{\\text{Risk}_{\\text{exposed}}}$.\n\nThe proposed design-based fix, emulating a target trial, directly addresses this flaw. Instead of fixing exposure at baseline, it aligns the start of follow-up. For each patient who initiates Drug X on a given day (the index day), their follow-up begins on that day. To create a valid comparison group, other patients who are still alive, at risk, and unexposed on that same index day are selected. Both the exposed patient and their matched unexposed counterparts are then followed for an identical duration (here, $40$ days, which corresponds to the maximum remaining follow-up for a patient starting on day $20$, i.e., $60 - 20 = 40$). This design ensures that at the start of their respective risk periods, the exposed and unexposed groups are comparable. It correctly handles the time-varying nature of the exposure, eliminating the immortal time.\n\n### Task C: Calculation\n\nThe risk ratio is defined as $RR = \\frac{R_U}{R_E}$, where $R_U$ is the cumulative incidence risk in the unexposed group and $R_E$ is the cumulative incidence risk in the exposed group.\n\n**1.
