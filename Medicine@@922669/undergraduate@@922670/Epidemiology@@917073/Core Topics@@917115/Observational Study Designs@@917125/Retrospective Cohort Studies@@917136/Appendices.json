All necessary information is provided, and the requested calculations follow directly from standard epidemiological definitions.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Computation of the Naive Crude Risk Ratio, $RR_{\\text{naive}}$\n\nRisk, also known as cumulative incidence, is defined as the proportion of individuals in a population, initially free of disease, who develop the disease during a specified time interval. It is calculated as:\n$$\n\\text{Risk} = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases}}{\\text{Number of persons at risk at the start}}\n$$\nThe problem provides data for a naive analysis that classifies individuals as \"ever exposed\" or \"never exposed\" over the entire $12$-month follow-up.\n\nFor the \"never-exposed\" group, the number of individuals is $N_{\\text{never}} = 520$, and the number of events is $E_{\\text{never}} = 132$. The risk for this group is:\n$$\nR_{\\text{never}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{never}}}{N_{\\text{never}}} = \\frac{132}{520}\n$$\nSimplifying this fraction:\n$$\nR_{\\text{never}} = \\frac{4 \\times 33}{4 \\times 130} = \\frac{33}{130}\n$$\n\nFor the \"ever-exposed\" group, the number of individuals is $N_{\\text{ever}} = 480$, and the number of events is $E_{\\text{ever}} = 24$. The risk for this group is:\n$$\nR_{\\text{ever}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{ever}}}{N_{\\text{ever}}} = \\frac{24}{480} = \\frac{1}{20}\n$$\n\nThe naive crude risk ratio, $RR_{\\text{naive}}$, is the ratio of the risk in the ever-exposed group to the risk in the never-exposed group:\n$$\nRR_{\\text{naive}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{ever}}}{R_{\\text{never}}} = \\frac{1/20}{33/130}\n$$\n$$\nRR_{\\text{naive}} = \\frac{1}{20} \\times \\frac{130}{33} = \\frac{130}{660} = \\frac{13}{66}\n$$\n\nPart 2: Computation of the Corrected Hazard Ratio, $HR_{\\text{corrected}}$\n\nA more appropriate analysis for time-varying exposures involves modeling the hazard rate, which is an instantaneous measure of risk. The hazard rate, $\\lambda(t)$, is the number of events per unit of person-time. Assuming a constant hazard over the follow-up period, we can estimate it as:\n$$\n\\text{Hazard Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Number of events}}{\\text{Total person-time at risk}}\n$$\nThe problem provides person-time data classified by true exposure status at each moment in time.\n\nThe hazard rate while unexposed, $h_{\\text{unexp}}$, is calculated using the unexposed person-time ($PT_{\\text{unexp}} = 8800$ person-months) and the number of events that occurred during this time ($E_{\\text{unexp}} = 132$):\n$$\nh_{\\text{unexp}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{unexp}}}{PT_{\\text{unexp}}} = \\frac{132}{8800}\n$$\nSimplifying this fraction:\n$$\nh_{\\text{unexp}} = \\frac{132}{88 \\times 100} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 88}{88 \\times 100} = \\frac{1.5}{100} = \\frac{3}{200} \\text{ events per person-month}\n$$\n\nThe hazard rate while exposed, $h_{\\text{exp}}$, is calculated using the exposed person-time ($PT_{\\text{exp}} = 3200$ person-months) and the number of events that occurred during this time ($E_{\\text{exp}} = 24$):\n$$\nh_{\\text{exp}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{exp}}}{PT_{\\text{exp}}} = \\frac{24}{3200}\n$$\nSimplifying this fraction:\n$$\nh_{\\text{exp}} = \\frac{24}{32 \\times 100} = \\frac{3 \\times 8}{4 \\times 8 \\times 100} = \\frac{3}{400} \\text{ events per person-month}\n$$\n\nThe hazard ratio, $HR$, is the ratio of the hazard rates. The problem assumes proportional hazards, meaning this ratio is constant over time. The corrected hazard ratio, $HR_{\\text{corrected}}$, is therefore:\n$$\nHR_{\\text{corrected}} = \\frac{h_{\\text{exp}}}{h_{\\text{unexp}}} = \\frac{3/400}{3/200}\n$$\n$$\nHR_{\\text{corrected}} = \\frac{3}{400} \\times \\frac{200}{3} = \\frac{200}{400} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\nPart 3: Computation of the Immortal Time Bias, $B$\n\nThe immortal time bias is defined as the absolute difference between the naive risk ratio and the corrected hazard ratio, $B = RR_{\\text{naive}} - HR_{\\text{corrected}}$.\nWe substitute the previously calculated values:\n$$\nB = \\frac{13}{66} - \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nTo subtract these, we find a common denominator, which is $66$:\n$$\nB = \\frac{13}{66} - \\frac{33}{66} = \\frac{13 - 33}{66} = \\frac{-20}{66}\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction gives the final value for the bias:\n$$\nB = -\\frac{10}{33}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the naive analysis produces an estimate of effect ($RR_{\\text{naive}} \\approx 0.197$) that is spuriously smaller (more protective) than the corrected estimate ($HR_{\\text{corrected}} = 0.5$).

Construction of Stabilized Weights\n\nStabilized weights, $sw_i$, are computed by multiplying the IPTW by the marginal probability of the exposure group. First, we estimate the marginal probability of exposure, $\\hat{p}_A$, as the proportion of exposed individuals in the cohort. There are $4$ exposed individuals ($A_i=1$) in the sample of $n=8$.\n$$ \\hat{p}_A = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i}{n} = \\frac{4}{8} = 0.5 $$\nThe marginal probability of non-exposure is $1 - \\hat{p}_A = 0.5$.\n\nThe formula for the stabilized weight is:\nFor an exposed individual ($A_i=1$): $sw_i = \\frac{\\hat{p}_A}{\\hat{e}(\\mathbf{X}_i)}$.\nFor an unexposed individual ($A_i=0$): $sw_i = \\frac{1 - \\hat{p}_A}{1 - \\hat{e}(\\mathbf{X}_i)}$.\n\nThe stabilized weights for all $8$ subjects are:\n$sw_1 = \\frac{0.5}{0.8} = 0.625$\n$sw_2 = \\frac{0.5}{0.7} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n$sw_3 = \\frac{0.5}{1-0.3} = \\frac{0.5}{0.7} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n$sw_4 = \\frac{0.5}{0.6} = \\frac{5}{6}$\n$sw_5 = \\frac{0.5}{1-0.4} = \\frac{0.5}{0.6} = \\frac{5}{6}$\n$sw_6 = \\frac{0.5}{1-0.2} = \\frac{0.5}{0.8} = 0.625 = \\frac{5}{8}$\n$sw_7 = \\frac{0.5}{0.9} = \\frac{5}{9}$\n$sw_8 = \\frac{0.5}{1-0.5} = \\frac{0.5}{0.5} = 1$\n\nStabilization is a technique used to improve the statistical properties of inverse probability weights. By multiplying the standard IPTW by the marginal probability of the observed exposure, the weights are rescaled. This process typically reduces the variance of the weights, leading to a more stable and efficient estimate of the treatment effect compared to using unstabilized weights. The resulting pseudo-population created by stabilized weights has a marginal exposure distribution that matches the original sample.\n\n3. Estimation of the Marginal Risk Difference\n\nThe marginal risk difference, $\\widehat{RD}$, is the difference between the weighted average outcome in the exposed group ($\\hat{\\mu}_1$) and the unexposed group ($\\hat{\\mu}_0$), using the stabilized weights $sw_i$.\n$$ \\widehat{RD} = \\hat{\\mu}_1 - \\hat{\\mu}_0 $$\nwhere\n$$ \\hat{\\mu}_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i: A_i=1} sw_i \\cdot Y_i}{\\sum_{i: A_i=1} sw_i} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\hat{\\mu}_0 = \\frac{\\sum_{i: A_i=0} sw_i \\cdot Y_i}{\\sum_{i: A_i=0} sw_i} $$\nFirst, we calculate $\\hat{\\mu}_1$ for the exposed group ($A_i=1$: subjects $1, 2, 4, 7$).\nThe numerator is the sum of weighted outcomes:\n$$ \\sum_{i: A_i=1} sw_i \\cdot Y_i = sw_1 \\cdot 1 + sw_2 \\cdot 0 + sw_4 \\cdot 1 + sw_7 \\cdot 1 = \\frac{5}{8} + 0 + \\frac{5}{6} + \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{45 + 60 + 40}{72} = \\frac{145}{72} $$\nThe denominator is the sum of weights:\n$$ \\sum_{i: A_i=1} sw_i = sw_1 + sw_2 + sw_4 + sw_7 = \\frac{5}{8} + \\frac{5}{7} + \\frac{5}{6} + \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{315 + 360 + 420 + 280}{504} = \\frac{1375}{504} $$\nThus, the weighted average outcome for the exposed is:\n$$ \\hat{\\mu}_1 = \\frac{145/72}{1375/504} = \\frac{145}{72} \\times \\frac{504}{1375} = \\frac{145 \\times 7}{1375} = \\frac{1015}{1375} = \\frac{203}{275} $$\nNext, we calculate $\\hat{\\mu}_0$ for the unexposed group ($A_i=0$: subjects $3, 5, 6, 8$).\nThe numerator is the sum of weighted outcomes:\n$$ \\sum_{i: A_i=0} sw_i \\cdot Y_i = sw_3 \\cdot 1 + sw_5 \\cdot 0 + sw_6 \\cdot 0 + sw_8 \\cdot 0 = \\frac{5}{7} $$\nThe denominator is the sum of weights:\n$$ \\sum_{i: A_i=0} sw_i = sw_3 + sw_5 + sw_6 + sw_8 = \\frac{5}{7} + \\frac{5}{6} + \\frac{5}{8} + 1 = \\frac{120 + 140 + 105 + 168}{168} = \\frac{533}{168} $$\nThus, the weighted average outcome for the unexposed is:\n$$ \\hat{\\mu}_0 = \\frac{5/7}{533/168} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{168}{533} = \\frac{5 \\times 24}{533} = \\frac{120}{533} $$\nFinally, we compute the marginal risk difference:\n$$ \\widehat{RD} = \\hat{\\mu}_1 - \\hat{\\mu}_0 = \\frac{203}{275} - \\frac{120}{533} = \\frac{203 \\times 533 - 120 \\times 275}{275 \\times 533} = \\frac{108199 - 33000}{146575} = \\frac{75199}{146575} $$\nAs a decimal, this is $\\widehat{RD} \\approx 0.51304108$.\nRounding to four significant figures, the marginal risk difference is $0.5130$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5130}$$", "id": "4631690"}]}
