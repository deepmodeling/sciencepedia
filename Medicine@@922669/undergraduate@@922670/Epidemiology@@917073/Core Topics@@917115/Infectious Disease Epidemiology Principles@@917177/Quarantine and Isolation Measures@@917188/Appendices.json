The objective is to compute $S = q - E[D]$.\n\nWe will first calculate the expected quarantine duration, $E[D]$, by conditioning on the infection status of the traced contact. The law of total expectation states:\n$$E[D] = E[D | \\text{Infected}] \\cdot P(\\text{Infected}) + E[D | \\text{Uninfected}] \\cdot P(\\text{Uninfected})$$\nThe problem provides the prior probability of a contact being truly infected as $\\pi = 0.20$.

Quarantine starts at $t=0$, and daily tests begin on day $1$. Quarantine duration is the number of days until an exit condition is met, including the day of exit. The exit conditions are triggered only on or after day $5$:\n1.  Exit upon the first positive RAT result on or after day $5$.\n2.  Exit upon obtaining two consecutive negative RAT results, where the second negative is on day $d \\geq 6$.\n\nThis implies that every contact remains in quarantine for a minimum of $5$ days, as no exit is possible before day $5$.\n\nLet's calculate $E_I[D]$, the expected quarantine duration for a truly infected contact.\nFor an infected contact:\n- For days $d < 5$, the RAT result is deterministically negative.\n- For days $d \\geq 5$, the probability of a positive result is $\\alpha = 0.60$, and the probability of a negative result is $1-\\alpha = 0.40$. The results are independent across days.\n\nLet $D_I$ be the quarantine duration for an infected individual.

The test is positive. This is the first positive result on or after day $5$, so the contact exits quarantine. The duration is $D_I=6$.\n    2.  The test is negative. The contact now has two consecutive negative results (day $5$ and day $6$). The second negative is on day $6$, which satisfies the condition $d \\geq 6$. The contact is released.
