Investigators enumerated all attendees and ascertained illness within a defined incubation window consistent with the suspected pathogen. Among those who ate the chicken salad (exposed cohort), $180$ attendees were at risk at the start of the lunch and $54$ developed illness within $48$ hours. Among those who did not eat the chicken salad (unexposed cohort), $120$ attendees were at risk and $12$ developed illness within $48$ hours.

We are given data on exposure to a suspected food item (chicken salad) and subsequent illness. The analysis will proceed from first principles, defining fundamental epidemiologic measures and then using them to compute comparative effects.\n\nFirst, let us organize the provided data. Let $E$ denote the exposed cohort (ate chicken salad) and $U$ denote the unexposed cohort (did not eat chicken salad). Let $D$ be the event of developing illness (a case) and $\\bar{D}$ be the event of remaining well (a non-case).\n\nThe givens are:\n- Total number at risk in the exposed cohort: $N_E = 180$\n- Number of ill individuals in the exposed cohort: $D_E = 54$\n- Total number at risk in the unexposed cohort: $N_U = 120$\n- Number of ill individuals in the unexposed cohort: $D_U = 12$\n\nFrom these, we can deduce the number of individuals who remained well in each cohort:\n- Number of well individuals in the exposed cohort: $\\bar{D}_E = N_E - D_E = 180 - 54 = 126$\n- Number of well individuals in the unexposed cohort: $\\bar{D}_U = N_U - D_U = 120 - 12 = 108$\n\nThese data can be summarized in a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc|c}\n & \\text{Ill } (D) & \\text{Well } (\\bar{D}) & \\text{Total} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Exposed } (E) & 54 & 126 & 180 \\\\\n\\text{Unexposed } (U) & 12 & 108 & 120 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Total} & 66 & 234 & 300\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n**Step 1: Definition and Computation of Attack Rates (Risk)**\n\nThe attack rate is a form of cumulative incidence, representing the risk ($R$) of developing a disease over a specified period within a population at risk. It is defined as:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases}}{\\text{Population at risk at start of period}} $$\nThis study design is a cohort study, as we are following defined groups (cohorts) forward in time from exposure to ascertain the outcome.\n\nThe attack rate for the exposed cohort is the risk of illness given exposure, $R_E$:\n$$ R_E = \\frac{D_E}{N_E} = \\frac{54}{180} = \\frac{3}{10} = 0.3 $$\nThe attack rate for the unexposed cohort is the risk of illness given no exposure, $R_U$:\n$$ R_U = \\frac{D_U}{N_U} = \\frac{12}{120} = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1 $$\n\n**Step 2: Construction and Computation of Comparative Measures**\n\nWe build the comparative measures using the fundamental risks ($R_E$ and $R_U$).\n\n**Risk Ratio (RR):**\nThe risk ratio, or relative risk, compares the risk of disease in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group. It is a measure of the strength of the association.\n$$ RR = \\frac{\\text{Risk in exposed}}{\\text{Risk in unexposed}} = \\frac{R_E}{R_U} $$\nUsing the calculated values:\n$$ RR = \\frac{0.3}{0.1} = 3 $$\n\n**Risk Difference (RD):**\nThe risk difference, or attributable risk, measures the absolute excess risk of disease in the exposed group compared to the unexposed group. It quantifies the public health impact of the exposure.\n$$ RD = \\text{Risk in exposed} - \\text{Risk in unexposed} = R_E - R_U $$\nUsing the calculated values:\n$$ RD = 0.3 - 0.1 = 0.2 $$\n\n**Odds Ratio (OR):**\nThe odds ratio compares the odds of disease in the exposed group to the odds of disease in the unexposed group. First, we must define the odds. The odds of an event with probability (risk) $R$ is the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring ($1-R$).\n$$ \\text{Odds} = \\frac{R}{1-R} $$\nFor the exposed cohort, the odds of illness are:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_E = \\frac{R_E}{1-R_E} = \\frac{D_E / N_E}{1 - D_E / N_E} = \\frac{D_E / N_E}{(N_E - D_E) / N_E} = \\frac{D_E}{N_E - D_E} = \\frac{54}{126} = \\frac{3}{7} $$\nFor the unexposed cohort, the odds of illness are:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_U = \\frac{R_U}{1-R_U} = \\frac{D_U / N_U}{1 - D_U / N_U} = \\frac{D_U / N_U}{(N_U - D_U) / N_U} = \\frac{D_U}{N_U - D_U} = \\frac{12}{108} = \\frac{1}{9} $$\nThe odds ratio is the ratio of these two odds:\n$$ OR = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_E}{\\text{Odds}_U} = \\frac{3/7}{1/9} = \\frac{3}{7} \\times \\frac{9}{1} = \\frac{27}{7} $$\n\n**Step 3: Justification and Interpretation of Measures**\n\n**Appropriateness of Measures:**\n- **Risk Ratio ($RR$)**: In a cohort study like this outbreak investigation, the $RR$ is arguably the most direct and intuitive measure of association. It quantifies the multiplicative increase in risk due to the exposure. An $RR$ of $3$ indicates that those who ate the chicken salad were three times as likely to become ill as those who did not.\n- **Risk Difference ($RD$)**: The $RD$ provides a measure of absolute effect, which is critical for public health assessment. An $RD$ of $0.2$ means that the chicken salad was associated with an excess of $20$ cases of gastroenteritis for every $100$ people who ate it. It directly quantifies the burden of disease attributable to the exposure in this population.\n- **Odds Ratio ($OR$)**: The $OR$ is the only valid measure of association in a case-control study, where risks cannot be directly computed. While mathematically valid to calculate in a cohort study, it is less directly interpretable than the $RR$. Its value represents the ratio of the odds of illness in the exposed to the unexposed.\n\n**The \"Rare Disease\" Assumption:**\nThe $OR$ provides a good approximation of the $RR$ only when the disease is rare in both the exposed and unexposed groups (conventionally, when risk $< 0.1$). This is because if risk $R$ is small, then $1-R \\approx 1$, which means $\\text{Odds} = R/(1-R) \\approx R$. In this problem, the risk in the exposed group is $R_E=0.3$, which is not small. As a result, the $OR$ of $\\frac{27}{7} \\approx 3.857$ is a poorer approximation and significant overestimate of the $RR$, which is $3$. Therefore, in this specific cohort analysis, the $RR$ is the preferred measure of relative association.\n\n**Complementarity with Primary and Secondary Attack Rates:**\nThe attack rates calculated here ($R_E=0.3$ and $R_U=0.1$) are *primary* attack rates, as they quantify illness resulting from the initial common-source exposure (the catered lunch). The comparative measures ($RR$, $RD$) derived from them are crucial for identifying the specific vehicle of transmission (the chicken salad) by showing a strong statistical association. A *secondary attack rate*, which is not calculated here, would measure the risk of transmission from the primary cases (those who became ill from the lunch) to their susceptible close contacts (e.g., family members). Thus, the primary attack rates and their comparative measures help identify the source and vehicle of an outbreak, while secondary attack rates assess the pathogen's contagiousness and potential for subsequent person-to-person spread.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0.2 & \\frac{27}{7} \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "4571856"}, {"introduction": "Real-world outbreak investigations are rarely neat; data often comes from multiple, sometimes incomplete, sources.

The following information is available.\n\n- A check-in log documented $240$ attendees.\n- Exposure definition: an attendee is considered exposed if they consumed any food or beverage served at the luncheon between 12:00 and 14:00 on June $10$.\n- Illness case definition for this event: a primary case is an attendee with new onset of compatible gastrointestinal symptoms occurring $6$ to $72$ hours after the meal. A confirmed case meets this clinical criterion and has a laboratory-confirmed Salmonella Enteritidis infection from a stool specimen. A probable case meets the clinical criterion without laboratory confirmation but is epidemiologically linked to the event. Secondary cases (for example, household contacts who did not attend) are not counted as event cases.\n- Investigators completed standardized interviews for $200$ of the $240$ attendees. Among those $200$ interviewed:\n  - $38$ attendees met the event case definition and reported consuming food or beverage at the luncheon; of these, $24$ were laboratory-confirmed and $14$ were probable.

These $12$ non-consumers did not include any of the $5$ attendees with pre-event symptom onset.\n\nUsing only the information above and starting from fundamental epidemiologic definitions, construct the appropriate numerator and denominator for the event-specific attack rate among attendees exposed to the luncheon, specifying inclusion and exclusion criteria for each.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in epidemiology. It provides a realistic scenario with multiple, consistent data sources that must be synthesized to determine the correct values. All necessary definitions (exposure, case) and data (population counts, case counts, exclusion criteria) are provided. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness. The task is to apply standard epidemiologic definitions to the given data.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe event-specific attack rate is a measure of incidence proportion, defined as the number of new cases of a disease that develop during a specific time interval divided by the population at risk at the start of that interval.\n\n$$ \\text{Attack Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases}}{\\text{Population at risk}} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the attack rate \"among attendees exposed to the luncheon.\" This specifies that both the numerator (cases) and the denominator (population at risk) must be restricted to the group of attendees who were exposed.\n\n**1. Construction of the Numerator (Number of New Cases)**\n\nThe numerator consists of all individuals who meet the event case definition. According to the problem, an event case is an attendee with new onset of compatible gastrointestinal symptoms occurring $6$ to $72$ hours after the meal on June $10$. Cases must be incident, meaning their illness began *after* the exposure.\n\n**Inclusion Criteria for Numerator:**\n- Must be an attendee of the luncheon.\n- Must have symptom onset between $6$ and $72$ hours after the meal.\n- Must be a primary case (not a household contact).\n- Must have been exposed (consumed food or beverage).\n\n**Application of Criteria:**\n- From the $200$ interviewed attendees, $38$ individuals met the case definition. They were all exposed (\"reported consuming food or beverage\") and their symptom onsets ($8$ to $60$ hours post-meal) fall within the defined $6-72$ hour window. These $38$ cases (which include $24$ confirmed and $14$ probable cases) are included in the numerator.\n- From the $40$ attendees who were not interviewed, surveillance identified $6$ laboratory-confirmed cases. Their onsets ($18$ to $60$ hours post-meal) are within the case definition window. They were also documented as being exposed (\"consumed food at the luncheon\"). These $6$ cases are included in the numerator.\n\n**Exclusion Criteria for Numerator:**\n- Individuals with symptom onset outside the $6-72$ hour window.\n- Individuals who were already ill before the event (prevalent cases).\n- The $2$ interviewed attendees with symptom onset after June $15$ ($>120$ hours) are excluded.\n- The $5$ attendees with symptom onset on June $9$ (before the event) are prevalent, not incident, cases and are excluded from the numerator. The $3$ interviewed attendees with pre-event symptoms are a subset of this group of $5$.\n\n**Calculation of Numerator:**\nThe total number of new cases is the sum of cases identified from both the interviewed and non-interviewed groups.\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = 38 \\, (\\text{from interviews}) + 6 \\, (\\text{from surveillance}) = 44 $$\n\n**2. Construction of the Denominator (Population at Risk)**\n\nThe denominator is the total number of attendees who were at risk of developing the illness from the luncheon. To be \"at risk,\" an individual must have been both **exposed** to the source and **susceptible** to the illness.\n\n**Inclusion Criteria for Denominator:**\n- Must be an attendee of the luncheon.\n- Must be exposed (consumed food or drink).\n- Must be susceptible (not already ill with the same condition prior to exposure).\n\n**Application of Criteria starting from Total Population:**\nThe total number of attendees is given as $240$. We must subtract individuals who do not meet the \"at risk\" criteria.\n\n**Exclusion Criteria for Denominator:**\n- **Not Exposed:** The problem states that event records documented $12$ attendees who did not consume any food or beverage. These individuals were not exposed and therefore not at risk from the food. They are excluded from the denominator.\n- **Not Susceptible:** The problem states that event records documented $5$ attendees had symptom onset on June $9$, before the event. These individuals were already ill and thus not susceptible to becoming new cases from the June $10$ exposure. They are excluded from the denominator.\n\nThe problem clarifies that the group of $12$ non-consumers and the group of $5$ pre-event ill persons are distinct (\"did not include any of the $5$ attendees\"). Therefore, we can subtract both counts directly from the total.\n\n**Calculation of Denominator:**\nThe population at risk is the total number of attendees minus those who were not exposed and those who were not susceptible.\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = \\text{Total Attendees} - \\text{Not Exposed Attendees} - \\text{Not Susceptible Attendees} $$\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = 240 - 12 - 5 = 223 $$\n\nThe resulting denominator of $223$ represents the number of attendees who were exposed and susceptible, which is the correct population at risk.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Attack Rate**\n\nUsing the calculated numerator and denominator:\n$$ \\text{Attack Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Numerator}}{\\text{Denominator}} = \\frac{44}{223} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the result as a decimal proportion rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\frac{44}{223} \\approx 0.197309417... $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.1973$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1973}$$", "id": "4571920"}, {"introduction": "After identifying the source of an outbreak using primary attack rates, the next question is often: how contagious is the disease?

It answers the question: \"What is the average of the transmission risks observed across households?\" This approach gives equal weight to the SAR from each household, regardless of the number of susceptible individuals in it. For instance, the $SAR_G = 1.0$ (from $1$ secondary case out of $1$ susceptible) is given the same importance as $SAR_C = 0.8$ (from $4$ secondary cases out of $5$ susceptibles). This can be problematic because estimates from smaller households are less precise (have higher variance) than those from larger households.\n\n- The **pooled overall SAR** ($SAR_{\\text{pooled}} = \\frac{11}{24}$) is based on the fundamental definition of risk applied to the entire cohort of susceptible individuals. It effectively creates a single, large group of all susceptible contacts from all households and calculates the proportion who become ill. This approach implicitly weights each household-specific SAR by the number of susceptible contacts in that household ($S_i$). This method adheres to the first principle that risk is the number of events (new cases) divided by the total population at risk. The underlying assumption is that each susceptible individual in the study has the same underlying probability of infection, regardless of which household they belong to. It answers the question: \"What is the average risk of infection for a susceptible household contact?\"\n\n**Conclusion on Appropriateness:** The **pooled overall secondary attack rate ($SAR_{\\text{pooled}}$)** is the more appropriate single-number summary for this dataset. It provides a more stable and precise estimate of the average individual-level risk of transmission by correctly weighting each household's contribution by its size. This aligns with the fundamental epidemiological principle of calculating risk for the entire population at risk, thereby avoiding the potential bias introduced by giving equal weight to household-specific estimates of varying precision.\n\nThe question asks for the value from part $3$, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$SAR_{\\text{pooled}} = \\frac{11}{24} \\approx 0.458333...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.4583$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.4583}\n$$", "id": "4571894"}]}
