Daily Force of Infection ($\\lambda$)**\n\nThe problem states that the instantaneous hazard of infection for a susceptible individual, which is the force of infection $\\lambda$, is proportional to the fraction of the population that is infectious. This can be written as:\n$$ \\lambda \\propto \\frac{I}{N} $$\nThe constant of proportionality in this mass-action formulation is the effective infectious contact parameter, $\\beta$. Thus, the force of infection is given by the equation:\n$$ \\lambda = \\beta \\frac{I}{N} $$\nWe are given the values:\n- $\\beta = 0.3 \\text{ day}^{-1}$\n- $I = 100$\n- $N = 10,000$\n\nThe problem assumes $I$ and $N$ are constant over the one-day interval, which means $\\lambda$ is also constant during this period. Substituting the given values:\n$$ \\lambda = 0.3 \\text{ day}^{-1} \\times \\frac{100}{10,000} = 0.3 \\times 0.01 \\text{ day}^{-1} = 0.003 \\text{ day}^{-1} $$\nThis is the daily force of infection, expressed in the required per-day units.\n\n**2. Expected Number of New Infections**\n\nThe force of infection, $\\lambda$, is the instantaneous per-capita rate at which susceptible individuals become infected. The rate of loss of susceptibles, $S(t)$, is therefore described by the following first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dS(t)}{dt} = -\\lambda S(t) $$\nHere, $\\lambda$ is constant. We can solve this differential equation to find the number of susceptibles remaining after a time interval $\\Delta t = 1$ day. We separate variables:\n$$ \\frac{dS}{S} = -\\lambda dt $$\nWe integrate both sides over the interval from $t=0$ to $t=1$. The number of susceptibles changes from $S_0 = 9,000$ at $t=0$ to $S(1)$ at $t=1$:\n$$ \\int_{S_0}^{S(1)} \\frac{1}{S} dS = \\int_{0}^{1} -\\lambda dt $$\n$$ [\\ln|S|]_{S_0}^{S(1)} = [-\\lambda t]_{0}^{1} $$\n$$ \\ln(S(1)) - \\ln(S_0) = -\\lambda(1 - 0) $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{S(1)}{S_0}\\right) = -\\lambda $$\nTo solve for $S(1)$, we take the exponential of both sides:\n$$ \\frac{S(1)}{S_0} = \\exp(-\\lambda) $$\n$$ S(1) = S_0 \\exp(-\\lambda) $$\nThe number of new infections during the day, which we can denote as $I_{new}$, is the decrease in the susceptible population from $t=0$ to $t=1$:\n$$ I_{new} = S_0 - S(1) = S_0 - S_0 \\exp(-\\lambda) = S_0 (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)) $$\nThis derivation from first principles correctly accounts for the depletion of the susceptible pool during the interval, which is a more rigorous approach than a simple linear approximation (e.g., $\\lambda S_0 \\Delta t$). The stochastic interpretation, where $1 - \\exp(-\\lambda \\Delta t)$ is the probability of a single susceptible becoming infected over the interval $\\Delta t$, yields the same formula for the expected number of infections, $S_0 (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda \\Delta t))$.\n\nWe substitute the known values:\n- $S_0 = 9,000$\n- $\\lambda = 0.003 \\text{ day}^{-1}$\n- The time interval is $\\Delta t = 1$ day, so the exponent is simply $-\\lambda$.\n\nThe expected number of new infections is:\n$$ I_{new} = 9,000 \\left(1 - \\exp(-0.003)\\right) $$\nThis expression is an exact value, as requested by the problem. It represents the expected count of new cases.\n\nThe two requested values are the daily force of infection and the expected number of new infections.\n1.

It is scientifically grounded in standard epidemiological modeling principles, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and stated using objective, formal language. The problem requires a derivation from first principles, a calculation based on the derived formula, and a conceptual explanation of the model's limitations, all of which are standard exercises in quantitative biology and epidemiology.\n\nThe solution is divided into three parts as requested by the problem statement. First, we derive the expression for the human force of infection, $\\lambda_h$. Second, we compute the net fractional reduction in $\\lambda_h$ due to the combined interventions. Third, we provide a conceptual explanation for non-linear effects in more complex models.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Human Force of Infection\n\nThe human force of infection, $\\lambda_h$, is defined as the instantaneous per capita rate at which susceptible individuals acquire infection. Mathematically, this is a hazard rate, expressed as the limit of the probability of becoming infected in a small time interval $\\Delta t$, divided by the duration of that interval, given susceptibility at the start of the interval.\n$$ \\lambda_h = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{P(\\text{infection in } [t, t+\\Delta t] | \\text{susceptible at } t)}{\\Delta t} $$\nThe problem states that contacts between humans and the animal reservoir follow a Poisson process with rate $c$. The number of contacts, $N(\\Delta t)$, occurring in a small time interval of length $\\Delta t$ is a random variable following a Poisson distribution with mean $c \\Delta t$. The probability mass function is:\n$$ P(N(\\Delta t) = k) = \\frac{\\exp(-c \\Delta t) (c \\Delta t)^k}{k!} \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\nEach contact results in transmission with an independent probability $p$, a Bernoulli trial. An individual avoids infection in the interval $\\Delta t$ if, for every contact that occurs, the transmission event fails. The probability of transmission failure for a single contact is $1-p$.\n\nThe probability of remaining uninfected throughout the interval $\\Delta t$ is found by summing over all possible numbers of contacts, $k$.\n$$ P(\\text{no infection in } \\Delta t) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} P(\\text{no infection in } \\Delta t | N(\\Delta t)=k) \\times P(N(\\Delta t)=k) $$\nGiven $k$ contacts, the probability of no infection is $(1-p)^k$, since the transmission events are independent.\n$$ P(\\text{no infection in } \\Delta t) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (1-p)^k \\frac{\\exp(-c \\Delta t) (c \\Delta t)^k}{k!} $$\nWe can factor out the term $\\exp(-c \\Delta t)$ which does not depend on $k$.\n$$ P(\\text{no infection in } \\Delta t) = \\exp(-c \\Delta t) \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{((1-p)c \\Delta t)^k}{k!} $$\nThe summation is the Taylor series expansion for the exponential function $\\exp(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^k}{k!}$, with $x=(1-p)c \\Delta t$.\n$$ P(\\text{no infection in } \\Delta t) = \\exp(-c \\Delta t) \\exp((1-p)c \\Delta t) = \\exp(-c \\Delta t + (1-p)c \\Delta t) = \\exp(-cp \\Delta t) $$\nThis result reflects the \"thinning\" property of Poisson processes: if events from a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda$ are independently selected with probability $p$, the resulting process of selected events is also a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda p$. Here, the process of infectious contacts is a Poisson process with rate $cp$.\n\nThe probability of becoming infected in the interval $\\Delta t$ is the complement of not becoming infected.\n$$ P(\\text{infection in } \\Delta t) = 1 - P(\\text{no infection in } \\Delta t) = 1 - \\exp(-cp \\Delta t) $$\nTo evaluate the limit for $\\lambda_h$, we use the Taylor series expansion for $\\exp(-x)$ around $x=0$, which is $1 - x + O(x^2)$. For small $\\Delta t$, we have $x=cp \\Delta t$.\n$$ P(\\text{infection in } \\Delta t) = 1 - \\left(1 - cp \\Delta t + O((\\Delta t)^2)\\right) = cp \\Delta t + O((\\Delta t)^2) $$\nSubstituting this into the definition of the force of infection:\n$$ \\lambda_h = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{cp \\Delta t + O((\\Delta t)^2)}{\\Delta t} = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\left(cp + O(\\Delta t)\\right) $$\n$$ \\lambda_h = cp $$\nThis is the first-order expression for the human force of infection.\n\nPart 2: Computation of the Net Fractional Reduction\n\nLet the baseline parameters be $c_0 = c$ and $p_0 = p$. The baseline force of infection is $\\lambda_{h,0} = c_0 p_0 = cp$.\n\nThe first intervention, a physical barrier, reduces the contact rate by $20\\%$. The new contact rate, $c_1$, is:\n$$ c_1 = c_0 \\times (1 - 0.20) = 0.8 c_0 = 0.8 c $$\nThe second intervention, PPE, reduces the per-contact transmission probability by $30\\%$. The new transmission probability, $p_1$, is:\n$$ p_1 = p_0 \\times (1 - 0.30) = 0.7 p_0 = 0.7 p $$\nThe interventions are assumed to act independently on $c$ and $p$. The new force of infection, $\\lambda_{h,1}$, with both interventions implemented concurrently is:\n$$ \\lambda_{h,1} = c_1 p_1 = (0.8 c)(0.7 p) = 0.56 cp $$\nThe net fractional reduction in the force of infection is defined as the change in the force of infection divided by the original force of infection:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Reduction} = \\frac{\\lambda_{h,0} - \\lambda_{h,1}}{\\lambda_{h,0}} = \\frac{cp - 0.56 cp}{cp} $$\nFactoring out $cp$ from the numerator (assuming $c>0$ and $p>0$):\n$$ \\text{Fractional Reduction} = \\frac{cp(1 - 0.56)}{cp} = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44 $$\nThe problem asks for the result as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\text{Fractional Reduction} = 0.4400 $$\n\nPart 3: Explanation of Non-linear Combined Effects\n\nThe model used above, $\\lambda_h = cp$, assumes that the per-contact transmission probability, $p$, is a constant, independent of the nature or intensity of the contact. This assumption of independence leads to a simple multiplicative effect of interventions on $c$ and $p$.\n\nA more realistic model would consider that the probability of infection is not constant, but rather a function of the dose of pathogen transferred during a contact, let's say $p = f(d)$. Biological dose-response curves, $f(d)$, are typically non-linear and saturating. This means that as the dose $d$ increases, the infection probability $p$ increases, but the rate of increase slows down and $p$ approaches a maximum value (often less than $1$). This functional form is concave down, at least for higher doses.\n\nIn this more complex framework, \"interaction between interventions\" can lead to non-linear combined effects. An intervention like PPE would primarily act by reducing the dose received per contact, so a contact that would have delivered dose $d$ now delivers a reduced dose $d' < d$. The assumption of a \"reduction of $30\\%$ in $p$\" is an oversimplification, as the actual fractional reduction in $p$, which is $1 - f(d')/f(d)$, would depend on the initial dose $d$.\n\nThe qualitative direction of deviation under a \"saturating dose-response\" scenario can be determined. Saturation implies that the system is operating in a high-dose regime where the dose-response curve $f(d)$ is flattening. In this regime, the function is concave, meaning a reduction in dose has a diminished effect on the probability of infection. For instance, if the baseline dose is very high and already on the plateau of the curve, even a significant reduction in dose might cause only a negligible drop in infection probability.\n\nTherefore, the simple model's assumption of a constant $30\\%$ reduction in $p$ due to PPE is likely an overestimate of the intervention's true effectiveness in a high-dose, saturating system. The actual reduction in $p$ would be less than $30\\%$. Consequently, the combined effect of the two interventions would be less effective than predicted by the simple multiplicative model. The net fractional reduction in the force of infection would be smaller than the calculated $0.44$. This type of interaction, where the combined effect is less than what is predicted by assuming independence, is often termed antagonistic.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4400}$$", "id": "4669266"}]}
