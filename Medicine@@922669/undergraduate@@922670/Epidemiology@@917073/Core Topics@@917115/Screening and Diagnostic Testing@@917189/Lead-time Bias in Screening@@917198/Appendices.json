Consider a single patient whose disease follows a natural timeline with three events: biological onset at time $t_{0}$, clinical diagnosis in usual care at time $t_{c}$, and death at time $t_{d}$. Survival time from diagnosis is defined as the time interval from diagnosis to death. Screening advances the time of diagnosis by a fixed amount $L$ relative to usual care, that is, the screening diagnosis occurs at time $t_{s} = t_{c} - L$.

There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard, simplified model to explain a real-world statistical artifact in medical research. Proceeding to the solution.\n\nThe solution will address the three tasks in the order presented.\n\n**1. Definition and Explanation of Lead-Time Bias**\n\nLead-time bias is a statistical artifact that occurs when evaluating the effectiveness of a screening program. It is the apparent increase in survival time for patients whose disease is detected by screening, compared to those diagnosed by usual clinical practice, that is solely attributable to the earlier diagnosis time and not to any true therapeutic benefit or alteration of the disease's natural history.\n\nThis bias arises when survival is measured from the point of diagnosis. The \"lead time\" is the period between when the disease could be detected by screening and when it would have been diagnosed conventionally due to symptoms. By advancing the time of diagnosis, screening naturally lengthens the period from diagnosis to death, even if the time of death is unchanged.\n\nIn the context of the given problem:\n-   The time of diagnosis without screening is $t_{c}$.\n-   The time of diagnosis with screening is $t_{s}$.\n-   The lead time is the duration by which diagnosis is advanced: $t_{c} - t_{s} = t_{c} - (t_{c} - L) = L$.\n-   The fundamental assumption that causes the bias is that we start measuring survival from two different points in time ($t_{s}$ versus $t_{c}$) but the end point ($t_{d}$) remains the same for both scenarios. This creates an illusion of longer survival for the screened patient.\n\n**2. Derivation of Apparent Survival Gain**\n\nThe apparent survival gain is the difference between the survival time measured from a screen-detected diagnosis and the survival time measured from a diagnosis in usual care. We will derive this from first principles using the provided definitions.\n\nLet $S_{\\text{usual}}$ denote the survival time under usual care. By definition, this is the interval from clinical diagnosis to death:\n$$S_{\\text{usual}} = t_{d} - t_{c}$$\n\nLet $S_{\\text{screened}}$ denote the survival time when the disease is detected by screening. This is the interval from the screening diagnosis to death:\n$$S_{\\text{screened}} = t_{d} - t_{s}$$\n\nThe problem states that the screening diagnosis occurs at time $t_{s} = t_{c} - L$. We substitute this expression into the equation for $S_{\\text{screened}}$:\n$$S_{\\text{screened}} = t_{d} - (t_{c} - L) = t_{d} - t_{c} + L$$\n\nThe apparent survival gain, which we denote as $\\Delta S$, is the difference between these two survival durations:\n$$\\Delta S = S_{\\text{screened}} - S_{\\text{usual}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $S_{\\text{screened}}$ and $S_{\\text{usual}}$:\n$$\\Delta S = (t_{d} - t_{c} + L) - (t_{d} - t_{c})$$\nThe terms cancel out as follows:\n$$\\Delta S = t_{d} - t_{c} + L - t_{d} + t_{c}$$\n$$\\Delta S = (t_{d} - t_{d}) + (- t_{c} + t_{c}) + L$$\n$$\\Delta S = 0 + 0 + L$$\nTherefore, the expression for the apparent survival gain due solely to earlier detection is:\n$$\\Delta S = L$$\nThis derivation formally shows that the apparent improvement in survival is exactly equal to the lead time, $L$, under the assumption that the screening does not alter the time of death $t_{d}$.\n\n**3. Evaluation for $L = 2$ years**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the apparent survival gain for the case where the lead time $L$ is $2$ years.\nUsing the expression derived in the previous step:\n$$\\Delta S = L$$\nGiven $L = 2$, we substitute this value into the expression:\n$$\\Delta S = 2$$\nThe apparent survival gain from diagnosis due to earlier detection is $2$ years. This means that simply by diagnosing the disease $2$ years earlier, the measured survival time automatically increases by $2$ years, giving a false impression of benefit when none exists (as per the problem's assumption that $t_d$ is unchanged).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "4857011"}, {"introduction": "Building on the deterministic model, this practice [@problem_id:4814961] introduces a more realistic, probabilistic framework common in survival analysis.

Assume the screening does not change disease-specific mortality, meaning the natural time from clinical detectability to prostate cancer death is unchanged by screening. A core concern in clinical epidemiology is lead-time bias: when screening advances the time of diagnosis by some lead time without altering the time of death, survival measured from diagnosis can appear improved. Consider the following model grounded in survival analysis. Let the time from clinical detectability (that is, when the disease would have been diagnosed without screening) to prostate cancer death be a random variable $T$ that follows an exponential distribution with constant hazard rate $\\lambda$ per year, so its survival function is $S_{T}(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$. Suppose PSA screening advances diagnosis by a constant lead time $L$ years (that is, the diagnosis with screening occurs $L$ years earlier than it would have otherwise), while the distribution of $T$ remains unchanged. Define the apparent gain in $5$-year disease-specific survival measured from diagnosis due solely to lead-time bias as $\\Delta S_{5} = P(T + L \\geq 5) - P(T \\geq 5)$.

The problem describes lead-time bias using a standard theoretical model, which is a recognized concept in medical statistics.\n\nWe are tasked with computing the apparent gain in $5$-year disease-specific survival due to lead-time bias, denoted as $\\Delta S_{5}$. The problem provides the necessary components for this calculation.\n\nFirst, let us define the random variable $T$ as the time from clinical detectability to death from prostate cancer. The distribution of $T$ is given as exponential with a constant hazard rate $\\lambda$. The survival function for $T$, which gives the probability that an individual survives past time $t$, is:\n$$S_{T}(t) = P(T \\geq t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\nThis function assumes $t \\geq 0$.\n\nWithout screening, the $5$-year survival rate is the probability that an individual survives at least $5$ years from the time of clinical diagnosis. This is given by:\n$$P(T \\geq 5) = S_{T}(5) = \\exp(-5\\lambda)$$\n\nNext, we consider the effect of screening. Screening advances the time of diagnosis by a constant lead time $L$, but it does not alter the time of death. Therefore, the time from the new, earlier diagnosis (by screening) until death is $T + L$. The new survival time, measured from the point of the screening diagnosis, is a new random variable, let's call it $T_{\\text{screen}} = T + L$.\n\nThe $5$-year survival rate as measured from the screening diagnosis is the probability that an individual survives at least $5$ years from this new point in time. This is calculated as:\n$$P(T_{\\text{screen}} \\geq 5) = P(T + L \\geq 5)$$\n\nSince $L$ is a constant, we can rearrange the inequality:\n$$P(T + L \\geq 5) = P(T \\geq 5 - L)$$\nThis probability can be evaluated using the survival function $S_{T}(t)$ with $t = 5 - L$.\n$$P(T \\geq 5 - L) = S_{T}(5 - L) = \\exp(-\\lambda(5 - L))$$\nThis is valid because for the given values, $5 - L > 0$.\n\nThe apparent gain in $5$-year survival, $\\Delta S_{5}$, is defined as the difference between the $5$-year survival rate with screening and the $5$-year survival rate without screening.\n$$\\Delta S_{5} = P(T + L \\geq 5) - P(T \\geq 5)$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions we derived:\n$$\\Delta S_{5} = \\exp(-\\lambda(5 - L)) - \\exp(-5\\lambda)$$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Hazard rate, $\\lambda = 0.10$ per year.\n- Lead time, $L = 3.0$ years.\n\nNow, we substitute these numerical values into the expression for $\\Delta S_{5}$:\n$$\\Delta S_{5} = \\exp(-0.10 \\times (5 - 3.0)) - \\exp(-0.10 \\times 5)$$\n$$\\Delta S_{5} = \\exp(-0.10 \\times 2) - \\exp(-0.5)$$\n$$\\Delta S_{5} = \\exp(-0.2) - \\exp(-0.5)$$\n\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we evaluate the exponential functions:\n$$\\exp(-0.2) \\approx 0.81873075$$\n$$\\exp(-0.5) \\approx 0.60653066$$\n\nCalculating the difference:\n$$\\Delta S_{5} \\approx 0.81873075 - 0.60653066 = 0.21220009$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The solution is founded on the steady-state relationship between incidence, prevalence, and the duration of a disease state.\n\nLet $P_{\\text{PDP}}$ be the prevalence of the disease in its Preclinical Detectable Phase (PDP), defined as the proportion of the population that has the disease in this phase at a specific point in time. Let $I_{\\text{PDP}}$ be the incidence rate of the disease, representing the rate at which individuals enter the PDP per unit of time. Let $\\bar{D}_{\\text{PDP}}$ be the mean duration of the PDP. For a system in a steady state, as assumed in the problem, these three quantities are related by the fundamental epidemiological formula:\n$$P_{\\text{PDP}} = I_{\\text{PDP}} \\times \\bar{D}_{\\text{PDP}}$$\n\nThe problem states that the entry into the PDP and exit via clinical diagnosis are in a steady state. This implies that the rate of individuals entering the PDP ($I_{\\text{PDP}}$) is equal to the rate of individuals leaving the PDP through clinical diagnosis. This latter rate is given as the incidence of clinical diagnosis in the absence of screening, which we will denote as $I_{\\text{clin}}$.

The screen was administered to a population of size $N = 50000$ and detected $Y = 180$ individuals in the PDP. However, this number of detected cases is affected by the screening test's sensitivity, given as $s = 0.90$. The number of detected cases, $Y$, is the true number of cases in the PDP, $Y_{\\text{true}}$, multiplied by the sensitivity, $s$:\n$$Y = Y_{\\text{true}} \\times s$$\nTherefore, the estimated true number of individuals in the PDP at the time of screening is:\n$$Y_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{Y}{s} = \\frac{180}{0.90} = 200$$\nThe prevalence is the proportion of the population in this state:\n$$P_{\\text{PDP}} = \\frac{Y_{\\text{true}}}{N} = \\frac{200}{50000} = \\frac{2}{500} = \\frac{1}{250} = 0.004$$\n\nNow we have the values for both $P_{\\text{PDP}}$ and $I_{\\text{clin}}$.
