Consequently, the probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - p$.\n-   **Sensitivity ($\\text{sens}$)**: The probability that the test is positive, given that the individual has the disease. It is the true positive rate.\n    $$ \\text{sens} = P(T^+ | D) = 0.90 $$\n-   **Specificity ($\\text{spec}$)**: The probability that the test is negative, given that the individual does not have the disease. It is the true negative rate.\n    $$ \\text{spec} = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.95 $$\nFrom specificity, we can derive the false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test given the individual does not have the disease:\n    $$ P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - \\text{spec} = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 $$\n\nThe quantity we need to evaluate is the **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**, which is the probability that an individual actually has the disease, given that they have tested positive. Using the definition of conditional probability, we have:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(D | T^+) $$\n\nWe apply Bayes' theorem to express PPV in terms of prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result in the population. We can expand it using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c) $$\nSubstituting the terms we have defined:\n$$ P(T^+) = (\\text{sens})(p) + (1 - \\text{spec})(1 - p) $$\nNow, we substitute this back into the expression for PPV:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{(\\text{sens})(p)}{(\\text{sens})(p) + (1 - \\text{spec})(1 - p)} $$\nThe problem requires that the PPV be at least $0.5$:\n$$ \\frac{(\\text{sens})(p)}{(\\text{sens})(p) + (1 - \\text{spec})(1 - p)} \\ge 0.5 $$\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values for sensitivity and specificity:\n$$ \\frac{0.90 p}{0.90 p + (0.05)(1 - p)} \\ge 0.5 $$\nTo solve for $p$, we can multiply both sides by the denominator. Since $p$ represents a prevalence, $0 \\le p \\le 1$, and the sensitivity and specificity are positive, the denominator is always positive.

This result directly relates to a key characteristic of a screenable disease: the disease must have a sufficiently high prevalence in the target population.\n\nThis threshold highlights a fundamental challenge for general population screening programs for many chronic diseases. The prevalence of numerous conditions, such as many types of cancer or inborn errors of metabolism, is often far below $5\\%$ in the general, unselected population. When a test, even one with high sensitivity and specificity like the one in this problem, is applied to a low-prevalence population, the number of false positives can vastly outnumber the true positives, resulting in a low PPV. A low PPV implies that a majority of individuals with positive results are actually disease-free, leading to significant harms including patient anxiety, costs and risks of unnecessary confirmatory diagnostic procedures, and the potential for overdiagnosis and overtreatment.\n\nTherefore, achieving a medically acceptable PPV is often not feasible for rare diseases through general population screening. This is why effective screening programs are frequently aimed at high-risk subpopulations (e.g., based on age, family history, or genetic markers) where the disease prevalence is considerably higher than in the general population, thereby increasing the PPV to a more acceptable level and improving the benefit-to-harm ratio of the screening intervention.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{19}}$$", "id": "4577378"}, {"introduction": "Building on the understanding that low prevalence limits a test's PPV, this problem explores a key public health strategy: risk stratification.

Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result. The prevalence, $P_{prev}$, is the prior probability of having the disease, $P(D)$. Therefore, $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - P_{prev}$.\n\nThe sensitivity, $Se$, of the test is the probability of a positive test result given that the individual has the disease:\n$$Se = P(T^+ | D)$$\n\nThe specificity, $Sp$, of the test is the probability of a negative test result given that the individual does not have the disease:\n$$Sp = P(T^- | D^c)$$\nFrom this, the probability of a positive test result given that the individual does not have the disease (the false positive rate) is:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - Sp$$\n\nThe positive predictive value, $PPV$, is the probability that an individual has the disease given a positive test result, i.e., $P(D | T^+)$. Using Bayes' theorem, we can express this as:\n$$PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. It can be calculated using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)$$\n\nSubstituting the definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence into this expression gives:\n$$P(T^+) = (Se \\cdot P_{prev}) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - P_{prev}))$$\n\nNow, substituting this expression for $P(T^+)$ back into the Bayes' theorem formula for $PPV$, we derive the expression for $PPV$ as a function of prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity:\n$$PPV(P_{prev}, Se, Sp) = \\frac{Se \\cdot P_{prev}}{(Se \\cdot P_{prev}) + (1 - Sp)(1 - P_{prev})}$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\n### Computation of the Ratio R\n\nNext, we compute the $PPV$ for the general population ($PPV_{gen}$) and the high-risk stratum ($PPV_{high}$) using the given values:\n-   $P_{gen} = 0.03$\n-   $P_{high} = 0.06$\n-   $Se = 0.92$\n-   $Sp = 0.96 \\implies 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.96 = 0.04$\n\nFor the general population:\n$$PPV_{gen} = \\frac{0.92 \\cdot 0.03}{(0.92 \\cdot 0.03) + (0.04)(1 - 0.03)}$$\n$$PPV_{gen} = \\frac{0.0276}{0.0276 + (0.04)(0.97)}$$\n$$PPV_{gen} = \\frac{0.0276}{0.0276 + 0.0388}$$\n$$PPV_{gen} = \\frac{0.0276}{0.0664}$$\n\nFor the high-risk stratum:\n$$PPV_{high} = \\frac{0.92 \\cdot 0.06}{(0.92 \\cdot 0.06) + (0.04)(1 - 0.06)}$$\n$$PPV_{high} = \\frac{0.0552}{0.0552 + (0.04)(0.94)}$$\n$$PPV_{high} = \\frac{0.0552}{0.0552 + 0.0376}$$\n$$PPV_{high} = \\frac{0.0552}{0.0928}$$\n\nThe ratio $R$ is defined as $R = \\frac{PPV_{high}}{PPV_{gen}}$:\n$$R = \\frac{\\frac{0.0552}{0.0928}}{\\frac{0.0276}{0.0664}}$$\nWe can simplify this expression by noting that the numerator of $PPV_{high}$ ($0.0552$) is exactly twice the numerator of $PPV_{gen}$ ($0.0276$), since $P_{high} = 2 \\cdot P_{gen}$.\n$$R = \\frac{\\frac{2 \\cdot 0.0276}{0.0928}}{\\frac{0.0276}{0.0664}} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{0.0664}{0.0928}$$\n$$R = \\frac{0.1328}{0.0928} \\approx 1.43093023...$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the result to $4$ significant figures.
