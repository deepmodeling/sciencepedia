It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective problem in theoretical epidemiology. It presents a classic scenario to illustrate the concept of length-biased sampling in prevalence studies, where all necessary information is provided to derive a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the prevalence-based odds ratio ($\\text{OR}_{\\text{prev}}$) from a cross-sectional survey in a steady-state population. The core connecting principle, under the given conditions of a steady state and a rare disease, is the relationship between prevalence ($p$), incidence rate ($\\lambda$), and mean duration of the disease ($\\bar{D}$).\n\nIn a steady-state population, the rate of individuals entering the diseased state (incidence) must balance the rate of individuals leaving it (recovery or death). For a rare disease, the number of susceptible individuals is approximately equal to the total population size in a given stratum. The relationship can be expressed as:\n$$\np \\approx \\lambda \\times \\bar{D}\n$$\nThe problem statement explicitly notes the \"rare-disease condition\", indicating that this approximation should be used. For the purpose of this derivation, we can treat this approximation as an equality, as is standard practice for such theoretical problems.\n\nLet the subscripts $0$ and $1$ denote the unexposed ($E=0$) and exposed ($E=1$) strata, respectively. We are given:\n- The incidence rate is the same in both strata: $\\lambda = 0.01 \\text{ year}^{-1}$.\n- The mean duration in the unexposed stratum is $\\bar{D}_{0} = 2 \\text{ years}$.\n- The mean duration in the exposed stratum is $\\bar{D}_{1} = 1 \\text{ year}$.\n\nUsing the fundamental relationship, we can calculate the prevalence in each stratum:\n\nFor the unexposed stratum ($E=0$):\n$$\np_{0} = \\lambda \\times \\bar{D}_{0} = (0.01 \\text{ year}^{-1}) \\times (2 \\text{ years}) = 0.02\n$$\n\nFor the exposed stratum ($E=1$):\n$$\np_{1} = \\lambda \\times \\bar{D}_{1} = (0.01 \\text{ year}^{-1}) \\times (1 \\text{ year}) = 0.01\n$$\n\nThe prevalences $p_{0}=0.02$ and $p_{1}=0.01$ are both small, confirming the consistency of the rare-disease assumption.\n\nThe prevalence-based odds ratio, $\\text{OR}_{\\text{prev}}$, is defined as the odds of disease in the exposed group divided by the odds of disease in the unexposed group. The odds of disease in a group with prevalence $p$ is $\\frac{p}{1-p}$.\nTherefore, the formula for the odds ratio is:\n$$\n\\text{OR}_{\\text{prev}} = \\frac{\\frac{p_{1}}{1 - p_{1}}}{\\frac{p_{0}}{1 - p_{0}}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated prevalence values into this formula:\n$$\n\\text{OR}_{\\text{prev}} = \\frac{\\frac{0.01}{1 - 0.01}}{\\frac{0.02}{1 - 0.02}}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{OR}_{\\text{prev}} = \\frac{\\frac{0.01}{0.99}}{\\frac{0.02}{0.98}}\n$$\n\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator:\n$$\n\\text{OR}_{\\text{prev}} = \\frac{0.01}{0.99} \\times \\frac{0.98}{0.02}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{OR}_{\\text{prev}} = \\frac{0.01 \\times 0.98}{0.02 \\times 0.99} = \\frac{1 \\times 0.98}{2 \\times 0.99} = \\frac{0.98}{1.98}\n$$\n\nTo express this as an exact fraction of integers, we can write:\n$$\n\\text{OR}_{\\text{prev}} = \\frac{98}{198}\n$$\nDividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $2$:\n$$\n\\text{OR}_{\\text{prev}} = \\frac{49}{99}\n$$\n\nIt is instructive to analyze the source of bias. The true measure of association for incidence is the incidence rate ratio (IRR), which is given as:\n$$\n\\text{IRR} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{exposed}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{unexposed}}} = \\frac{0.01}{0.01} = 1\n$$\nAn IRR of $1$ signifies no association between exposure and disease incidence (the null effect). However, the prevalence-based odds ratio is $\\frac{49}{99} \\approx 0.495$, which is less than $1$. This indicates a spurious protective effect. The estimate is biased away from the null value of $1$. This bias arises because the cross-sectional survey ascertains prevalent cases. Prevalent cases are a \"length-biased\" sample of incident cases, meaning cases with longer duration are more likely to be sampled. Since the exposure halves the disease duration (from $2$ years to $1$ year), exposed individuals, once they become ill, are present in the diseased population for a shorter time. Consequently, they are less likely to be counted in a cross-sectional survey, leading to a lower prevalence in the exposed group ($p_{1} < p_{0}$) even though the incidence rate is identical.

It represents a standard application of renewal theory and sampling theory to epidemiology. We can proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the distinction between the distribution of disease duration for incident (new) cases and prevalent (existing) cases. Due to the nature of cross-sectional sampling, individuals with longer disease durations are more likely to be captured in a survey, a phenomenon known as length-biased sampling.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental relationship between prevalence $P$, incidence $I$, and mean disease duration $\\mathbb{E}[T]$ in a steady state. Consider a large population of size $N$ (normalized to $N=1$). The number of individuals with the disease at any given time (prevalent cases) is $P \\times N = P$. In a steady state, the rate at which people enter this diseased state must equal the rate at which they leave it. The entry rate is the incidence, $I$ (new cases per person-year). The total number of new cases per year is $I \\times N = I$. The exit rate is the number of prevalent cases $P$ divided by their average duration. For this relation to hold, the average duration used must be that of incident cases, $\\mathbb{E}[T]$. Thus, the rate of recovery is $P/\\mathbb{E}[T]$. Equating inflow and outflow gives $I = P/\\mathbb{E}[T]$, or the well-known formula:\n$$P = I \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[T]$$\nHere, $T$ is the random variable for disease duration among incident cases, with probability density function (PDF) $f_T(t)$ and finite mean $\\mathbb{E}[T]$.\n\na) Derivation of the length-biased distribution and bias of the naive estimator.\n\nLet $D$ be the random variable for the total disease duration of a case sampled from the prevalent population at a cross-section. The probability of observing an individual with a disease duration of length $t$ is proportional to $t$ itself, because they are present to be sampled for a longer time. The number of incident cases with duration in $[t, t+dt]$ is proportional to $f_T(t)dt$. Each of these individuals contributes to the prevalent pool for a time $t$. Thus, the density of durations among prevalent cases is proportional to $t \\cdot f_T(t)$.\n\nTo find the PDF of $D$, which we denote $f_D(t)$, we normalize this relationship:\n$$f_D(t) = C \\cdot t \\cdot f_T(t)$$\nwhere $C$ is a normalization constant. For $f_D(t)$ to be a valid PDF, its integral over all possible durations must be $1$:\n$$\\int_0^\\infty f_D(t) dt = \\int_0^\\infty C \\cdot t \\cdot f_T(t) dt = 1$$\n$C \\int_0^\\infty t \\cdot f_T(t) dt = 1$. The integral is, by definition, the expected value of $T$, $\\mathbb{E}[T]$.\n$$C \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[T] = 1 \\implies C = \\frac{1}{\\mathbb{E}[T]}$$\nTherefore, the PDF of the total duration $T$ (denoted $D$ here for clarity) among prevalent cases is:\n$$f_D(t) = \\frac{t \\cdot f_T(t)}{\\mathbb{E}[T]}$$\nThis is the length-biased distribution.\n\nNext, we derive the expected value of the sample mean of observed durations, $\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{D}_{\\mathrm{obs}}]$. The observed durations $T_1, \\dots, T_n$ are independent and identically distributed draws from this length-biased distribution $f_D(t)$. Thus, $\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{D}_{\\mathrm{obs}}] = \\mathbb{E}[D]$.\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{D}_{\\mathrm{obs}}] = \\mathbb{E}[D] = \\int_0^\\infty t \\cdot f_D(t) dt = \\int_0^\\infty t \\cdot \\frac{t \\cdot f_T(t)}{\\mathbb{E}[T]} dt$$\n$$\\mathbb{E}[D] = \\frac{1}{\\mathbb{E}[T]} \\int_0^\\infty t^2 \\cdot f_T(t) dt$$\nThe integral is the definition of the second moment of $T$, $\\mathbb{E}[T^2]$. So,\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{D}_{\\mathrm{obs}}] = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[T^2]}{\\mathbb{E}[T]}$$\n\nThe naive estimator for incidence is $\\tilde{I} \\equiv P/\\bar{D}_{\\mathrm{obs}}$. To assess its bias, we examine its expected value. A direct calculation of $\\mathbb{E}[1/\\bar{D}_{\\mathrm{obs}}]$ is complex. For large sample sizes $n$, it is standard to approximate $\\mathbb{E}[\\tilde{I}]$ using $\\mathbb{E}[1/\\bar{D}_{\\mathrm{obs}}] \\approx 1/\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{D}_{\\mathrm{obs}}]$.\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\tilde{I}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{P}{\\bar{D}_{\\mathrm{obs}}}\\right] = P \\cdot \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\bar{D}_{\\mathrm{obs}}}\\right] \\approx P \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{D}_{\\mathrm{obs}}]}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{D}_{\\mathrm{obs}}]$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\tilde{I}] \\approx \\frac{P}{\\frac{\\mathbb{E}[T^2]}{\\mathbb{E}[T]}} = \\frac{P \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[T]}{\\mathbb{E}[T^2]}$$\nUsing the steady-state relation $P = I \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[T]$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\tilde{I}] \\approx \\frac{(I \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[T]) \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[T]}{\\mathbb{E}[T^2]} = I \\cdot \\frac{(\\mathbb{E}[T])^2}{\\mathbb{E}[T^2]}$$\nThe multiplicative bias factor is the ratio $\\mathbb{E}[\\tilde{I}] / I$:\n$$\\frac{\\mathbb{E}[\\tilde{I}]}{I} \\approx \\frac{(\\mathbb{E}[T])^2}{\\mathbb{E}[T^2]}$$\nSince the variance of $T$, $\\text{Var}(T) = \\mathbb{E}[T^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[T])^2$, must be positive for any non-constant duration, we have $\\mathbb{E}[T^2] > (\\mathbb{E}[T])^2$. This implies that the bias factor is less than $1$, so the naive estimator $\\tilde{I}$ is biased and systematically underestimates the true incidence $I$.\n\nb) Corrected estimator for incidence.\n\nTo correct for the bias, we need an unbiased estimator for $\\mathbb{E}[T]$ from the length-biased sample of durations $T_1, \\dots, T_n$. Let's examine the expectation of the reciprocal of a single length-biased duration $D$.\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{D}\\right] = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{t} f_D(t) dt = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{t} \\left(\\frac{t \\cdot f_T(t)}{\\mathbb{E}[T]}\\right) dt$$\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{D}\\right] = \\frac{1}{\\mathbb{E}[T]} \\int_0^\\infty f_T(t) dt$$\nSince $f_T(t)$ is a PDF, $\\int_0^\\infty f_T(t) dt = 1$. This yields the crucial identity:\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{D}\\right] = \\frac{1}{\\mathbb{E}[T]}$$\nThis identity allows us to recover $\\mathbb{E}[T]$ as $\\mathbb{E}[T] = 1 / \\mathbb{E}[1/D]$.\nBased on this, we can form a consistent estimator for $\\mathbb{E}[T]$. By the Law of Large Numbers, the sample mean of the reciprocals of the observed durations is a consistent estimator for $\\mathbb{E}[1/D]$:\n$$\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{T_i} \\xrightarrow{p} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{D}\\right] = \\frac{1}{\\mathbb{E}[T]}$$\nTherefore, a consistent estimator for $\\mathbb{E}[T]$ is the harmonic mean of the sample:\n$$\\widehat{\\mathbb{E}[T]} = \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{T_i} \\right)^{-1}$$\nWe can now construct a corrected, consistent estimator for the incidence $I$, denoted $\\hat{I}$, by substituting this into the fundamental relation $I = P/\\mathbb{E}[T]$:\n$$\\hat{I} = \\frac{P}{\\widehat{\\mathbb{E}[T]}} = \\frac{P}{\\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{T_i} \\right)^{-1}}$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the corrected estimator:\n$$\\hat{I} = P \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{T_i} \\right) = \\frac{P}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{T_i}$$\n\nc) Calculation of the corrected incidence estimate.\n\nWe are given the following data:\n- Point prevalence $P = 0.08$\n- Sample size $n = 10$\n- Observed durations (in years): $T_i \\in \\{1.2, 0.7, 3.4, 2.1, 4.0, 5.5, 0.9, 1.8, 2.7, 3.0\\}$\n\nWe use the corrected estimator $\\hat{I}$ derived in part (b):\n$$\\hat{I} = \\frac{P}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{T_i} = \\frac{0.08}{10} \\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\frac{1}{T_i}$$\nFirst, we compute the sum of the reciprocals of the durations:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\frac{1}{T_i} = \\frac{1}{1.2} + \\frac{1}{0.7} + \\frac{1}{3.4} + \\frac{1}{2.1} + \\frac{1}{4.0} + \\frac{1}{5.5} + \\frac{1}{0.9} + \\frac{1}{1.8} + \\frac{1}{2.7} + \\frac{1}{3.0}$$\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\frac{1}{T_i} \\approx 0.83333 + 1.42857 + 0.29412 + 0.47619 + 0.25000 + 0.18182 + 1.11111 + 0.55556 + 0.37037 + 0.33333$$\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\frac{1}{T_i} \\approx 5.83440$$\nNow, we calculate the incidence estimate:\n$$\\hat{I} = 0.008 \\times 5.83440 \\approx 0.0466752$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\\hat{I} \\approx 0.04668$$\nThe units are per year, as $P$ is dimensionless and each $1/T_i$ term has units of years$^{-1}$.
