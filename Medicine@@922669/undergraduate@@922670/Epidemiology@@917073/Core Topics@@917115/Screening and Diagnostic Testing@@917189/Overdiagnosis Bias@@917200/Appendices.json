By comparing the rate of disease diagnosis in a group offered screening to a control group receiving usual care, we can directly estimate the extent of overdiagnosis.

In the screened arm, the cumulative incidence is $CI_{\\text{screen}} = 420$ cases per $100{,}000$, and in the concurrent control arm, the cumulative incidence is $CI_{\\text{control}} = 310$ cases per $100{,}000$.\n\nFrom first principles, overdiagnosis bias in screening arises when detection includes cases that would not have presented clinically during the follow-up, inflating the observed cumulative incidence in the screened arm relative to the control arm.

The concepts of cumulative incidence, overdiagnosis, screened arm, and control arm are standard in this field. The definitions provided for absolute and relative overdiagnosis are consistent with common usage in the medical literature.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed.

It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities related to overdiagnosis bias using data from a randomized controlled trial. Let $CI_{\\text{screen}}$ be the cumulative incidence of the disease in the screened group and $CI_{\\text{control}}$ be the cumulative incidence in the control group.\n\nThe given values are:\n$$\nCI_{\\text{screen}} = 420 \\text{ cases per } 100{,}000\n$$\n$$\nCI_{\\text{control}} = 310 \\text{ cases per } 100{,}000\n$$\n\nThe fundamental assumption in this analysis is that the control arm's cumulative incidence, $CI_{\\text{control}}$, represents the background rate of disease diagnosis that would occur naturally (i.e., become clinically apparent) in the population over the follow-up period $T$. The screened arm is subject to this same background rate, but the screening test may detect additional cases. These additional cases—those that would not have become clinically apparent during the period $T$—are considered to be overdiagnosed, according to the problem's framework.\n\n**1. Absolute Overdiagnosis**\n\nThe problem defines absolute overdiagnosis as \"the excess cumulative incidence attributable to screening.\" This is the arithmetic difference between the cumulative incidence observed in the screened arm and that in the control arm. This excess represents the number of additional cases detected per $100{,}000$ people due to the screening intervention.\n\nLet $OD_{\\text{abs}}$ denote the absolute overdiagnosis. The formula is:\n$$\nOD_{\\text{abs}} = CI_{\\text{screen}} - CI_{\\text{control}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\nOD_{\\text{abs}} = 420 - 310 = 110\n$$\nThe absolute overdiagnosis is $110$ cases per $100{,}000$ population.\n\n**2. Relative Overdiagnosis**\n\nThe problem defines relative overdiagnosis as \"the excess normalized by the screened arm’s cumulative incidence.\" This metric expresses the number of overdiagnosed cases as a fraction of the total number of cases detected in the screened arm. It answers the question: \"Of all the cases found by screening, what proportion is due to overdiagnosis?\"\n\nLet $OD_{\\text{rel}}$ denote the relative overdiagnosis. The formula is:\n$$\nOD_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{\\text{Absolute Overdiagnosis}}{CI_{\\text{screen}}} = \\frac{CI_{\\text{screen}} - CI_{\\text{control}}}{CI_{\\text{screen}}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values and the previously calculated absolute overdiagnosis:\n$$\nOD_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{110}{420}\n$$\n\nTo express this as a fraction in simplest terms, we find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator. Both $110$ and $420$ are divisible by $10$.\n$$\nOD_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{110 \\div 10}{420 \\div 10} = \\frac{11}{42}\n$$\nThe numerator, $11$, is a prime number. The denominator, $42$, is not divisible by $11$ ($42 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 7$). Therefore, the fraction $\\frac{11}{42}$ is in its simplest terms.\n\nThe two requested quantities are an absolute overdiagnosis of $110$ cases per $100{,}000$ and a relative overdiagnosis of $\\frac{11}{42}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 110 & \\frac{11}{42} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4617106"}, {"introduction": "While RCTs are the gold standard, real-world trials are rarely perfect. A common challenge is \"contamination,\" where participants in the control group manage to receive the screening test outside of the study protocol. This practice demonstrates how such contamination can lead to an underestimation of overdiagnosis and equips you with the skill to adjust for it, revealing the importance of critically assessing trial conduct to arrive at a more accurate conclusion [@problem_id:4617049].", "problem": "In a population-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating a cancer screening program, overdiagnosis bias is estimated from excess cumulative incidence attributable to screening. Cumulative incidence is defined as the number of new diagnoses over a specified follow-up period per population at risk. Under the conceptual definition that the overdiagnosis estimate is the excess cumulative incidence in the screened arm relative to what would be observed in a truly unscreened control arm over the same follow-up, contamination of the control arm by off-protocol screening artificially inflates the observed control arm cumulative incidence. Assume the following scientifically consistent conditions: contamination affects only the control arm, its effect on incidence is additive over the follow-up window, and there are no other differential sources of incidence inflation between arms.\n\nYou observe a cumulative incidence in the screened arm of $CI_{\\text{screen}}=380$ per $100{,}000$ and in the control arm of $CI_{\\text{control}}=310$ per $100{,}000$ over the same follow-up.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of epidemiology and randomized controlled trial (RCT) analysis, specifically addressing the concept of overdiagnosis and contamination bias. The problem is well-posed, objective, self-contained, and logically consistent, providing all necessary definitions and data for a unique solution.\n\nThe core task is to calculate an adjusted estimate for overdiagnosis by correcting for contamination in the control arm of an RCT and to quantify the magnitude of this adjustment.\n\nLet us define the relevant quantities based on the problem statement. All cumulative incidence ($CI$) values are expressed per $100{,}000$ people over the follow-up period.\n- $CI_{\\text{screen}}$: The observed cumulative incidence in the screened arm.\n- $CI_{\\text{control}}$: The observed cumulative incidence in the control arm.\n- $CI_{\\text{contamination}}$: The additive incidence component in the control arm due to off-protocol screening (contamination).\n- $CI_{\\text{control, true}}$: The hypothetical cumulative incidence in a truly unscreened control arm.\n\nThe given values are:\n- $CI_{\\text{screen}} = 380$\n- $CI_{\\text{control}} = 310$\n- $CI_{\\text{contamination}} = 30$\n\nFirst, we calculate the naive overdiagnosis estimate, which we denote as $OD_{\\text{naive}}$. This estimate is derived by directly comparing the observed incidences, thereby ignoring the effect of contamination. It is the simple excess incidence in the screened arm relative to the observed control arm.\n$$OD_{\\text{naive}} = CI_{\\text{screen}} - CI_{\\text{control}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$OD_{\\text{naive}} = 380 - 310 = 70$$\nThe naive estimate suggests an overdiagnosis of $70$ cases per $100{,}000$ people.\n\nNext, we must derive the adjusted overdiagnosis estimate, $OD_{\\text{adjusted}}$. The problem provides a fundamental definition for this: \"the excess cumulative incidence in the screened arm relative to what would be observed in a truly unscreened control arm\". To use this definition, we must first estimate the cumulative incidence for a truly unscreened control arm, $CI_{\\text{control, true}}$.\n\nThe problem states that contamination has an additive effect on the control arm's incidence. Therefore, the observed control arm incidence is the sum of the true background incidence and the incidence attributable to contamination:\n$$CI_{\\text{control}} = CI_{\\text{control, true}} + CI_{\\text{contamination}}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the true control arm incidence:\n$$CI_{\\text{control, true}} = CI_{\\text{control}} - CI_{\\text{contamination}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$CI_{\\text{control, true}} = 310 - 30 = 280$$\nThis value, $280$ per $100{,}000$, represents the estimated cumulative incidence had there been no off-protocol screening in the control arm.\n\nNow, we can apply the fundamental definition of overdiagnosis to calculate the adjusted estimate, $OD_{\\text{adjusted}}$, by comparing the screened arm incidence to this corrected control arm incidence:\n$$OD_{\\text{adjusted}} = CI_{\\text{screen}} - CI_{\\text{control, true}}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$OD_{\\text{adjusted}} = 380 - 280 = 100$$\nThe adjusted estimate for overdiagnosis is $100$ cases per $100{,}000$ people. This is the first required component of the final answer.\n\nFinally, we must quantify the change in the overdiagnosis estimate relative to the naive estimate. This change, which we denote as $\\Delta OD$, is the absolute difference between the adjusted and naive estimates.\n$$\\Delta OD = OD_{\\text{adjusted}} - OD_{\\text{naive}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\\Delta OD = 100 - 70 = 30$$\nThe change is an increase of $30$ cases per $100{,}000$ people. This demonstrates that failing to account for contamination leads to an underestimation of overdiagnosis. The magnitude of this underestimation is exactly equal to the cumulative incidence attributable to contamination, as shown by the algebraic relationship:\n$OD_{\\text{adjusted}} - OD_{\\text{naive}} = (CI_{\\text{screen}} - CI_{\\text{control, true}}) - (CI_{\\text{screen}} - CI_{\\text{control}}) = CI_{\\text{control}} - CI_{\\text{control, true}} = CI_{\\text{contamination}}$.\nThis provides a logical verification of our result. This change is the second required component of the final answer.\n\nThe two requested values are the adjusted overdiagnosis estimate ($100$ per $100{,}000$) and the change relative to the naive estimate ($30$ per $100{,}000$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 100 & 30 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4617049"}, {"introduction": "Quantifying overdiagnosis is not just about population-level statistics; it's also about communicating risk to individuals.
