It is scientifically grounded in the principles of epidemiology, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. The problem requires the application of standard definitions for screening program evaluation metrics. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part response: defining key terms, deriving a relationship, and performing a calculation. We will address each part in sequence.\n\nLet us first define the variables based on the data provided:\n- $N_{target}$: The size of the eligible target population. In this problem, $N_{target} = 25,000$.\n- $N_{screened}$: The number of individuals who undergo screening. In this problem, $N_{screened} = 20,000$.\n- $N_{cases}$: The number of screen-detected cases, which are cases of the disease identified among the screened population. In this problem, $N_{cases} = 35$.\n\n**Part 1: Fundamental Definitions**\n\nWe are asked to state the fundamental definitions of screening coverage and screening yield.\n\n**Screening Coverage ($C$)** is defined as the proportion of the eligible target population that undergoes the screening test during a specified time period. It is a measure of the program's reach. Mathematically, it is expressed as the ratio of the number of individuals screened to the number of individuals in the eligible target population:\n$$\nC = \\frac{N_{screened}}{N_{target}}\n$$\n\n**Screening Yield ($Y$)** is defined as the proportion of individuals screened who are identified as having the disease. It is a measure of the number of cases detected by the screening process among those tested. It is also known as the case-detection rate. Mathematically, it is expressed as the ratio of the number of screen-detected cases to the number of individuals screened:\n$$\nY = \\frac{N_{cases}}{N_{screened}}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Detection Rate per $1,000$ Screened**\n\nWe are asked to formally define the detection rate per $1,000$ screened and derive its relationship to the yield.\n\nThe **detection rate per $k$ individuals screened** is a standardized measure that expresses the number of cases detected for a standard population size of $k$. This allows for comparison across programs or populations of different sizes. In this problem, the scaling factor is $k=1,000$.\n\nFormally, the detection rate per $1,000$ screened, which we denote as $R_{1000}$, is the number of screen-detected cases divided by the number of individuals screened, with the resulting proportion multiplied by $1,000$:\n$$\nR_{1000} = \\frac{N_{cases}}{N_{screened}} \\times 1000\n$$\nThe quantity $R_{1000}$ represents the expected number of cases that would be detected if $1,000$ individuals were screened, assuming a constant rate of detection.\n\nTo derive the relationship between the detection rate per $1,000$ screened ($R_{1000}$) and the screening yield ($Y$), we can directly substitute the definition of yield into the expression for the detection rate. From Part 1, we have $Y = \\frac{N_{cases}}{N_{screened}}$. Substituting this into the equation for $R_{1000}$ gives:\n$$\nR_{1000} = Y \\times 1000\n$$\nThis general expression shows that the detection rate per $1,000$ screened is simply the screening yield multiplied by a scaling factor of $1,000$.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the detection rate per $1,000$ screened for the given program. We will use the formula for $R_{1000}$ derived in Part 2 and the data provided in the problem statement.\n\nThe given data are:\n- Number of screen-detected cases, $N_{cases} = 35$.\n- Number of individuals screened, $N_{screened} = 20,000$.\n\nThe information about the eligible target population, $N_{target} = 25,000$, is necessary for calculating screening coverage but is not required for calculating the detection rate per $1,000$ screened.\n\nUsing the formula for $R_{1000}$:\n$$\nR_{1000} = \\frac{N_{cases}}{N_{screened}} \\times 1000\n$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\nR_{1000} = \\frac{35}{20,000} \\times 1000\n$$\nWe can simplify this expression:\n$$\nR_{1000} = \\frac{35}{20}\n$$\nPerforming the division gives the final numerical answer:\n$$\nR_{1000} = 1.75\n$$\nTherefore, the detection rate is $1.75$ cases per $1,000$ individuals screened.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.75}\n$$", "id": "4648481"}, {"introduction": "Program metrics calculated from data, such as coverage, are point estimates that contain statistical uncertainty.

We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts: first, the derivation of a large-sample confidence interval for a binomial proportion, and second, the computation of this interval for a specific case.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Large-Sample Confidence Interval**\n\nLet the number of individuals screened, $N_{\\text{screened}}$, be a realization of a random variable $X$. According to the problem statement, $X$ follows a binomial distribution with $n = N_{\\text{eligible}}$ trials and a probability of success $p$, where $p$ is the true coverage. We can write this as:\n$$ X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p) $$\nThe point estimator for the true coverage $p$ is the sample proportion $\\hat{p}$, defined as:\n$$ \\hat{p} = \\frac{X}{n} $$\nTo derive the confidence interval, we must first establish the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$. The expected value and variance of the binomial random variable $X$ are known to be $E[X] = np$ and $\\text{Var}(X) = np(1-p)$, respectively. Using the properties of expectation and variance, we find the moments of our estimator $\\hat{p}$:\nThe expected value of $\\hat{p}$ is:\n$$ E[\\hat{p}] = E\\left[\\frac{X}{n}\\right] = \\frac{1}{n}E[X] = \\frac{1}{n}(np) = p $$\nThis shows that $\\hat{p}$ is an unbiased estimator of $p$.\n\nThe variance of $\\hat{p}$ is:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\hat{p}) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{X}{n}\\right) = \\frac{1}{n^2}\\text{Var}(X) = \\frac{1}{n^2}(np(1-p)) = \\frac{p(1-p)}{n} $$\nThe standard deviation of $\\hat{p}$, also known as the standard error, is $\\text{SE}(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$.\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that for a sufficiently large sample size $n$, the distribution of the sample proportion $\\hat{p}$ is approximately normal. The mean of this normal distribution is $p$ and the variance is $\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}$.\n$$ \\hat{p} \\approx \\mathcal{N}\\left(p, \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}\\right) $$\nTo construct a confidence interval, we standardize the random variable $\\hat{p}$ to obtain a pivotal quantity that follows a standard normal distribution, $\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$:\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\hat{p} - E[\\hat{p}]}{\\text{SE}(\\hat{p})} = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} \\approx \\mathcal{N}(0, 1) $$\nFor a $100(1-\\alpha)\\%$ confidence interval, we seek a range for $p$ such that the probability of the true value $p$ being contained within that range is $1-\\alpha$. We find the critical value $z_{\\alpha/2}$ from the standard normal distribution, which is defined by $P(Z > z_{\\alpha/2}) = \\alpha/2$. By symmetry, we have:\n$$ P(-z_{\\alpha/2} \\le Z \\le z_{\\alpha/2}) = 1-\\alpha $$\nSubstituting the expression for $Z$, we get:\n$$ P\\left(-z_{\\alpha/2} \\le \\frac{\\hat{p} - p}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} \\le z_{\\alpha/2}\\right) \\approx 1-\\alpha $$\nThis inequality is difficult to solve for $p$ as $p$ appears in both the numerator and the denominator. For a large-sample approximation, we can replace the unknown parameter $p$ in the standard error term with its consistent estimator $\\hat{p}$. This yields the *estimated standard error*:\n$$ \\widehat{\\text{SE}}(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} $$\nThe modified pivotal quantity is then:\n$$ \\frac{\\hat{p} - p}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}} \\approx \\mathcal{N}(0, 1) $$\nThe probability statement for constructing the confidence interval becomes:\n$$ P\\left(-z_{\\alpha/2} \\le \\frac{\\hat{p} - p}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}} \\le z_{\\alpha/2}\\right) \\approx 1-\\alpha $$\nWe now isolate $p$ algebraically:\n$$ -z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} \\le \\hat{p} - p \\le z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} $$\nSubtracting $\\hat{p}$ from all parts of the inequality:\n$$ -\\hat{p} - z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} \\le -p \\le -\\hat{p} + z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} $$\nMultiplying by $-1$ and reversing the direction of the inequalities:\n$$ \\hat{p} + z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} \\ge p \\ge \\hat{p} - z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} $$\nThis gives the large-sample $100(1-\\alpha)\\%$ confidence interval for the true coverage $p$, commonly known as the Wald-type confidence interval:\n$$ \\left[ \\hat{p} - z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}, \\quad \\hat{p} + z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} \\right] $$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the 95% Confidence Interval**\n\nWe are given the following data:\n- Number of individuals screened: $N_{\\text{screened}} = 24{,}000$.\n- Number of eligible individuals: $n = N_{\\text{eligible}} = 50{,}000$.\n- The desired confidence level is $95\\%$, which corresponds to $1-\\alpha = 0.95$.\n\nFirst, we compute the sample proportion $\\hat{p}$:\n$$ \\hat{p} = \\frac{N_{\\text{screened}}}{N_{\\text{eligible}}} = \\frac{24{,}000}{50{,}000} = 0.48 $$\nFor a $95\\%$ confidence level, $\\alpha = 0.05$, so $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$.

For a population of size $N$ with disease prevalence $\\pi$, the total number of individuals with the disease is $N\\pi$. The sensitivity of the test, $\\mathrm{Se}$, is the probability of a positive test given the presence of disease, $P(T^+|D^+)$. Therefore, the expected number of true positives, or the yield, is given by:\n$$\n\\text{Yield} = N_{TP} = N \\times \\pi \\times \\mathrm{Se}\n$$\nMoving from operating point A to operating point B involves increasing the sensitivity from $\\mathrm{Se}_{A} = 0.80$ to $\\mathrm{Se}_{B} = 0.90$. This change directly increases the yield, as more of the existing cases will be detected.\n\nHowever, the referral rate, $r$, which is the total probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$, also increases from $r_{A} = 0.04$ to $r_{B} = 0.08$. The total number of referrals is composed of both true positives (individuals with the disease who test positive) and false positives (individuals without the disease who test positive). By the law of total probability, the referral rate can be expressed as:\n$$\nr = P(T^+) = P(T^+, D^+) + P(T^+, D^-)\n$$\nHere, $P(T^+, D^+)$ is the proportion of the population that are true positives, given by $P(T^+|D^+)P(D^+) = \\mathrm{Se} \\cdot \\pi$. The term $P(T^+, D^-)$ is the proportion of the population that are false positives, given by $P(T^+|D^-)P(D^-) = (1-\\mathrm{Sp}) \\cdot (1-\\pi)$, where $\\mathrm{Sp}$ is the test's specificity.\n\nWhen moving from operating point A to B, the increase in the proportion of true positives is:\n$$\n\\Delta P(TP) = (\\mathrm{Se}_{B} - \\mathrm{Se}_{A})\\pi = (0.90 - 0.80) \\times 0.01 = 0.10 \\times 0.01 = 0.001\n$$\nThe total increase in the referral rate is:\n$$\n\\Delta r = r_{B} - r_{A} = 0.08 - 0.04 = 0.04\n$$\nSince the increase in the overall referral rate ($\\Delta r = 0.04$) is substantially larger than the increase in the true positive rate ($\\Delta P(TP) = 0.001$), the difference must be accounted for by an increase in the false positive rate. Specifically, the change in the false positive proportion of the population is:\n$$\n\\Delta P(FP) = \\Delta r - \\Delta P(TP) = 0.04 - 0.001 = 0.039\n$$\nThis means that for every $1$ additional true case detected per $1000$ people, there are $39$ additional false positives. Optimizing the referral rate solely to maximize yield (true positives) ignores the substantial concurrent increase in false positives. False positives are harmful because they cause psychological distress and anxiety for the affected individuals, lead to costly and potentially invasive follow-up diagnostic procedures that carry their own risks, and place a significant unnecessary burden on healthcare resources. A rational screening policy must therefore balance the benefit of increased yield against the harm and cost of increased false positives.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation and Computation**\n\nThe objective is to calculate the change in the number of false positives, $\\Delta N_{FP}$, per $N=1000$ screened individuals when moving from operating point A to operating point B.\n\nA false positive occurs when an individual tests positive ($T^+$) but does not have the disease ($D^-$). The number of false positives, $N_{FP}$, in a screened population of size $N$ is:\n$$\nN_{FP} = N \\times P(T^+, D^-)\n$$\nAs established from the law of total probability, the referral rate $r = P(T^+)$ can be decomposed as:\n$$\nr = P(T^+, D^+) + P(T^+, D^-)\n$$\nRearranging this equation allows us to express the probability of a false positive, $P(T^+, D^-)$, in terms of the referral rate and the probability of a true positive:\n$$\nP(T^+, D^-) = r - P(T^+, D^+)\n$$\nThe probability of a true positive is $P(T^+, D^+) = P(T^+|D^+)P(D^+) = \\mathrm{Se} \\cdot \\pi$. Substituting this into the equation for $P(T^+, D^-)$ gives:\n$$\nP(T^+, D^-) = r - \\mathrm{Se} \\cdot \\pi\n$$\nTherefore, the number of false positives for a given operating point is:\n$$\nN_{FP} = N \\times (r - \\mathrm{Se} \\cdot \\pi)\n$$\nWe can now calculate the number of false positives for operating points A and B.\nFor point A:\n$$\nN_{FP, A} = N \\times (r_A - \\mathrm{Se}_A \\cdot \\pi)\n$$\nFor point B:\n$$\nN_{FP, B} = N \\times (r_B - \\mathrm{Se}_B \\cdot \\pi)\n$$\nThe change in the number of false positives when moving from A to B is $\\Delta N_{FP} = N_{FP, B} - N_{FP, A}$:\n$$\n\\Delta N_{FP} = \\left[ N \\times (r_B - \\mathrm{Se}_B \\cdot \\pi) \\right] - \\left[ N \\times (r_A - \\mathrm{Se}_A \\cdot \\pi) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta N_{FP} = N \\times \\left[ (r_B - \\mathrm{Se}_B \\cdot \\pi) - (r_A - \\mathrm{Se}_A \\cdot \\pi) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta N_{FP} = N \\times \\left[ (r_B - r_A) - (\\mathrm{Se}_B - \\mathrm{Se}_A) \\cdot \\pi \\right]\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given values: $N=1000$, $\\pi=0.01$, $r_A=0.04$, $\\mathrm{Se}_A=0.80$, $r_B=0.08$, and $\\mathrm{Se}_B=0.90$.\n$$\n\\Delta N_{FP} = 1000 \\times \\left[ (0.08 - 0.04) - (0.90 - 0.80) \\times 0.01 \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta N_{FP} = 1000 \\times \\left[ 0.04 - (0.10) \\times 0.01 \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta N_{FP} = 1000 \\times \\left[ 0.04 - 0.001 \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta N_{FP} = 1000 \\times [0.039]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta N_{FP} = 39\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
