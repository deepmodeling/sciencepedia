A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet $D$ be the event that an individual has the disease, and $D^c$ be the event that the individual does not have the disease. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result, and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe given information can be expressed in terms of conditional probabilities:\n- Prevalence: $P(D) = P = 0.1$. Consequently, the probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9$.\n- Sensitivity (True Positive Rate): $Se = P(T^+ | D) = 0.95$. This is the probability of a positive test given the presence of the disease.\n- Specificity (True Negative Rate): $Sp = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.98$. This is the probability of a negative test given the absence of the disease.\n\nWe will now derive expressions for the four required quantities.\n\n1.  **False Positive Rate (FPR)**\n    The false positive rate is the probability of a positive test result given that the individual does not have the disease. This is expressed as $P(T^+ | D^c)$. Since an individual without the disease must either test positive or negative, the sum of these probabilities is $1$:\n    $$P(T^+ | D^c) + P(T^- | D^c) = 1$$\n    We know that $P(T^- | D^c)$ is the specificity, $Sp$. Therefore, the FPR is:\n    $$FPR = P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - Sp$$\n    Numerically:\n    $$FPR = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$$\n\n2.  **False Negative Rate (FNR)**\n    The false negative rate is the probability of a negative test result given that the individual has the disease. This is expressed as $P(T^- | D)$. Since an individual with the disease must either test positive or negative, we have:\n    $$P(T^+ | D) + P(T^- | D) = 1$$\n    We know that $P(T^+ | D)$ is the sensitivity, $Se$. Therefore, the FNR is:\n    $$FNR = P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - Se$$\n    Numerically:\n    $$FNR = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\n\n3.  **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\n    The positive predictive value is the probability that an individual has the disease given a positive test result, which is $P(D | T^+)$. We use Bayes' theorem to find this:\n    $$PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n    To use this formula, we first need to find the overall probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$, using the law of total probability:\n    $$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\n    Substituting the known terms and the derived FPR:\n    $$P(T^+) = (Se \\times P) + (FPR \\times (1 - P)) = (Se \\times P) + ((1 - Sp) \\times (1 - P))$$\n    Now, substituting this back into the Bayes' theorem expression for PPV:\n    $$PPV = \\frac{Se \\times P}{(Se \\times P) + ((1 - Sp) \\times (1 - P))}$$\n    Numerically:\n    $$PPV = \\frac{0.95 \\times 0.1}{(0.95 \\times 0.1) + ((1 - 0.98) \\times (1 - 0.1))} = \\frac{0.095}{0.095 + (0.02 \\times 0.9)} = \\frac{0.095}{0.095 + 0.018} = \\frac{0.095}{0.113}$$\n    $$PPV \\approx 0.84070796...$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures gives $0.8407$.\n\n4.  **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\n    The negative predictive value is the probability that an individual does not have the disease given a negative test result, which is $P(D^c | T^-)$. Using Bayes' theorem again:\n    $$NPV = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\n    First, we find the overall probability of a negative test, $P(T^-)$, using the law of total probability:\n    $$P(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)$$\n    Substituting the known terms and the derived FNR:\n    $$P(T^-) = (Sp \\times (1 - P)) + (FNR \\times P) = (Sp \\times (1 - P)) + ((1 - Se) \\times P)$$\n    Substituting this back into the Bayes' theorem expression for NPV:\n    $$NPV = \\frac{Sp \\times (1 - P)}{(Sp \\times (1 - P)) + ((1 - Se) \\times P)}$$\n    Numerically:\n    $$NPV = \\frac{0.98 \\times (1 - 0.1)}{(0.98 \\times (1 - 0.1)) + ((1 - 0.95) \\times 0.1)} = \\frac{0.98 \\times 0.9}{(0.98 \\times 0.9) + (0.05 \\times 0.1)} = \\frac{0.882}{0.882 + 0.005} = \\frac{0.882}{0.887}$$\n    $$NPV \\approx 0.99436302...$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures gives $0.9944$.\n\nThe computed values, rounded to four significant figures as requested, are:\n- False Positive Rate: $0.02000$\n- False Negative Rate: $0.05000$\n- Positive Predictive Value: $0.8407$\n- Negative Predictive Value: $0.9944$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.02000 & 0.05000 & 0.8407 & 0.9944 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4987918"}, {"introduction": "A highly accurate test can be surprisingly misleading when applied to a population where a disease is rare.

Consequently, the probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - p$.\n-   **Sensitivity ($\\text{sens}$)**: The probability that the test is positive, given that the individual has the disease. It is the true positive rate.\n    $$ \\text{sens} = P(T^+ | D) = 0.90 $$\n-   **Specificity ($\\text{spec}$)**: The probability that the test is negative, given that the individual does not have the disease. It is the true negative rate.\n    $$ \\text{spec} = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.95 $$\nFrom specificity, we can derive the false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test given the individual does not have the disease:\n    $$ P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - \\text{spec} = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 $$\n\nThe quantity we need to evaluate is the **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**, which is the probability that an individual actually has the disease, given that they have tested positive. Using the definition of conditional probability, we have:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(D | T^+) $$\n\nWe apply Bayes' theorem to express PPV in terms of prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result in the population. We can expand it using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c) $$\nSubstituting the terms we have defined:\n$$ P(T^+) = (\\text{sens})(p) + (1 - \\text{spec})(1 - p) $$\nNow, we substitute this back into the expression for PPV:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{(\\text{sens})(p)}{(\\text{sens})(p) + (1 - \\text{spec})(1 - p)} $$\nThe problem requires that the PPV be at least $0.5$:\n$$ \\frac{(\\text{sens})(p)}{(\\text{sens})(p) + (1 - \\text{spec})(1 - p)} \\ge 0.5 $$\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values for sensitivity and specificity:\n$$ \\frac{0.90 p}{0.90 p + (0.05)(1 - p)} \\ge 0.5 $$\nTo solve for $p$, we can multiply both sides by the denominator. Since $p$ represents a prevalence, $0 \\le p \\le 1$, and the sensitivity and specificity are positive, the denominator is always positive. Thus, the direction of the inequality is preserved.\n$$ 0.90 p \\ge 0.5 [0.90 p + 0.05 (1 - p)] $$\n$$ 0.90 p \\ge 0.45 p + 0.025 (1 - p) $$\n$$ 0.90 p \\ge 0.45 p + 0.025 - 0.025 p $$\nCombine the terms involving $p$ on the right-hand side:\n$$ 0.90 p \\ge 0.425 p + 0.025 $$\nSubtract $0.425 p$ from both sides to isolate the terms with $p$:\n$$ (0.90 - 0.425) p \\ge 0.025 $$\n$$ 0.475 p \\ge 0.025 $$\nFinally, we solve for $p$:\n$$ p \\ge \\frac{0.025}{0.475} $$\nTo express this as an exact fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $1000$:\n$$ p \\ge \\frac{25}{475} $$\nDividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $25$:\n$$ p \\ge \\frac{25 \\div 25}{475 \\div 25} = \\frac{1}{19} $$\nThe minimal population prevalence $p$ required for the PPV to be at least $0.5$ is therefore $\\frac{1}{19}$.\n\nFor the discussion part of the problem:\nThe calculated prevalence threshold of $p = \\frac{1}{19}$ (approximately $0.0526$ or $5.26\\%$) is the minimum prevalence required in the screened population for a positive test result to be more likely true than false. This result directly relates to a key characteristic of a screenable disease: the disease must have a sufficiently high prevalence in the target population.\n\nThis threshold highlights a fundamental challenge for general population screening programs for many chronic diseases. The prevalence of numerous conditions, such as many types of cancer or inborn errors of metabolism, is often far below $5\\%$ in the general, unselected population. When a test, even one with high sensitivity and specificity like the one in this problem, is applied to a low-prevalence population, the number of false positives can vastly outnumber the true positives, resulting in a low PPV. A low PPV implies that a majority of individuals with positive results are actually disease-free, leading to significant harms including patient anxiety, costs and risks of unnecessary confirmatory diagnostic procedures, and the potential for overdiagnosis and overtreatment.\n\nTherefore, achieving a medically acceptable PPV is often not feasible for rare diseases through general population screening. This is why effective screening programs are frequently aimed at high-risk subpopulations (e.g., based on age, family history, or genetic markers) where the disease prevalence is considerably higher than in the general population, thereby increasing the PPV to a more acceptable level and improving the benefit-to-harm ratio of the screening intervention.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{19}}$$", "id": "4577378"}, {"introduction": "The decision to implement a screening program is never based on test accuracy alone; it requires a careful balancing of potential benefits against inevitable harms.

Among prevalent preclinical disease, a fraction $0.4$ is biologically indolent (would never become symptomatic or cause death within the follow-up horizon), and the remaining fraction $0.6$ is progressive (would eventually present clinically). Individuals with a positive screening test are referred for a confirmatory diagnostic procedure; $0.95$ of positives complete diagnostic confirmation.
