A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to compute the post-test probability of disease given a positive test result, $P(D^+ \\mid T^+)$, using two distinct but fundamentally equivalent methods.\n\n**1) Odds-Based Approach**\n\nThis method involves converting probabilities to odds, updating the odds using a likelihood ratio, and then converting the resulting post-test odds back to a probability.\n\nFirst, we define the odds of an event $A$ as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring:\n$$\nO(A) = \\frac{P(A)}{1 - P(A)}\n$$\nThe problem provides the pre-test probability of disease, $\\pi = P(D^+) = 0.15$. The corresponding pre-test odds of disease are:\n$$\nO_{\\text{pre}}(D^+) = \\frac{P(D^+)}{1 - P(D^+)} = \\frac{P(D^+)}{P(D^-)} = \\frac{\\pi}{1 - \\pi}\n$$\nNext, we define the positive likelihood ratio ($LR^+$), which is the ratio of the probability of a positive test in diseased individuals to the probability of a positive test in non-diseased individuals.\n$$\nLR^+ = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D^+)}{P(T^+ \\mid D^-)}\n$$\nThe numerator is the sensitivity, $\\text{Se} = P(T^+ \\mid D^+) = 0.85$. The denominator is derived from the specificity, $\\text{Sp} = P(T^- \\mid D^-) = 0.90$. Since $P(T^+ \\mid D^-) + P(T^- \\mid D^-) = 1$, we have $P(T^+ \\mid D^-) = 1 - \\text{Sp}$. Therefore,\n$$\nLR^+ = \\frac{\\text{Se}}{1 - \\text{Sp}}\n$$\nThe relationship between post-test odds and pre-test odds is given by multiplying the pre-test odds by the likelihood ratio.

This indicates that a negative result from Test 1 provides stronger evidence to rule out the disease compared to a negative result from Test 2. A negative result on Test 1 reduces the odds of disease to $12.5\\%$ of the pre-test odds, a more significant reduction than that of Test 2 ($22.2\\%$).\n\nThe trade-off is clear: Test 1, with its higher sensitivity ($\\text{Se}_1=0.90$), is superior for ruling out disease. Test 2, with its higher specificity ($\\text{Sp}_2=0.90$), is superior for ruling in disease.\n\nThe Diagnostic Odds Ratio ($DOR$) is a single summary measure of test performance, independent of disease prevalence.

There is no rationale within the threshold framework to proceed to Test C once the treatment threshold is crossed.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This option states the correct update rule (convert $P$ to odds, multiply by $LR^+$ for a positive result and by $LR^-$ for a negative result, convert back to $P$) and performs the correct calculations: $P_1 = \\dfrac{9}{16} = 0.5625$ after Test B positive, and $P_2 = \\dfrac{54}{61} \\approx 0.885$ after Test A positive. It applies the correct stopping rule: continue after $P_1$ (between thresholds) and stop and treat after $P_2$ (exceeds $p_{\\text{treat}}$). Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. This option incorrectly updates probability by directly multiplying $P$ by the likelihood ratio. Bayes’ theorem in odds form requires multiplying odds by the likelihood ratio, not the probability. The correct $P_1$ is $0.5625$, not $0.90$, so the immediate decision to treat after Test B positive is unjustified under the correct updating mechanism. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. This option uses $LR^-$ after a positive result, which contradicts the definition of likelihood ratios and Bayes’ updating: for a positive result, $LR^+$ must be used; $LR^-$ is only appropriate for a negative result. Consequently, its $P_1$ and $P_2$ are incorrect, and its decision to proceed further is based on incorrect updates. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. This option performs the correct updates numerically to obtain $P_1 = \\dfrac{9}{16}$ and $P_2 = \\dfrac{54}{61}$ but violates the threshold-based stopping rule by continuing testing after exceeding $p_{\\text{treat}}$. The stated requirement for further confirmation or a higher ad hoc threshold (such as $0.95$) is not part of the specified policy and undermines the purpose of decision thresholds. Verdict — Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4577677"}]}
