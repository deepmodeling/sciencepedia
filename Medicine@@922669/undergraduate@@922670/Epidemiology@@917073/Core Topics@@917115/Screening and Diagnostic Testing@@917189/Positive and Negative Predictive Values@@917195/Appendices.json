This exercise grounds your understanding by starting with a classic $2 \\times 2$ contingency table, where a new test's results are compared against a gold standard. By calculating the positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) and their complements—the false discovery rate (FDR) and false omission rate (FOR)—you will build a foundational skill set for interpreting diagnostic accuracy from primary data [@problem_id:4622628].", "problem": "A new diagnostic assay for a binary disease is evaluated in a cross-sectional study of $N=8000$ individuals whose true disease status is verified by a gold standard. Among individuals with disease, $1020$ test positive and $180$ test negative. Among individuals without disease, $680$ test positive and $6120$ test negative. Using only the fundamental definition of conditional probability applied to diagnostic testing, compute the positive predictive value (PPV, positive predictive value), the false discovery rate (FDR, false discovery rate), the negative predictive value (NPV, negative predictive value), and the false omission rate (FOR, false omission rate) from these counts, and briefly interpret how they are related by probability complements. Then, using the values you computed, evaluate the scalar\n$$R=\\frac{\\mathrm{PPV}+\\mathrm{NPV}}{\\mathrm{FDR}+\\mathrm{FOR}}.$$\nExpress the final value of $R$ as a single reduced fraction. Do not use a percentage sign anywhere; express any intermediate proportions as decimals or fractions as needed.

All necessary data are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of several diagnostic test metrics from a given set of counts. We can organize the provided data into a standard $2 \\times 2$ contingency table. Let $D+$ denote the presence of the disease and $D-$ denote its absence. Let $T+$ denote a positive test result and $T-$ denote a negative test result.\n\nThe givens are:\n- Total individuals in the study, $N=8000$.\n- Among individuals with disease ($D+$):\n  - Number who test positive ($T+$): This is the count of True Positives, $TP = 1020$.\n  - Number who test negative ($T-$): This is the count of False Negatives, $FN = 180$.\n- Among individuals without disease ($D-$):\n  - Number who test positive ($T+$): This is the count of False Positives, $FP = 680$.\n  - Number who test negative ($T-$): This is the count of True Negatives, $TN = 6120$.\n\nFrom these fundamental counts, we can calculate the marginal totals:\n- Total number of individuals with disease: $TP + FN = 1020 + 180 = 1200$.\n- Total number of individuals without disease: $FP + TN = 680 + 6120 = 6800$.\n- Total number of individuals with a positive test: $TP + FP = 1020 + 680 = 1700$.\n- Total number of individuals with a negative test: $FN + TN = 180 + 6120 = 6300$.\nThe grand total is $1200 + 6800 = 8000$ (or $1700 + 6300 = 8000$), which matches the given total $N$.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of four metrics using the fundamental definition of conditional probability.\n\n1.  **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**: The probability that an individual has the disease given a positive test result, $P(D+|T+)$.\n    $$ \\mathrm{PPV} = P(D+|T+) = \\frac{\\text{Number}(D+ \\cap T+)}{\\text{Number}(T+)} = \\frac{TP}{TP+FP} = \\frac{1020}{1020+680} = \\frac{1020}{1700} = \\frac{102}{170} = \\frac{3}{5} $$\n\n2.  **False Discovery Rate (FDR)**: The probability that an individual does not have the disease given a positive test result, $P(D-|T+)$.\n    $$ \\mathrm{FDR} = P(D-|T+) = \\frac{\\text{Number}(D- \\cap T+)}{\\text{Number}(T+)} = \\frac{FP}{TP+FP} = \\frac{680}{1020+680} = \\frac{680}{1700} = \\frac{68}{170} = \\frac{2}{5} $$\n\n3.  **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**: The probability that an individual does not have the disease given a negative test result, $P(D-|T-)$.\n    $$ \\mathrm{NPV} = P(D-|T-) = \\frac{\\text{Number}(D- \\cap T-)}{\\text{Number}(T-)} = \\frac{TN}{TN+FN} = \\frac{6120}{6120+180} = \\frac{6120}{6300} = \\frac{612}{630} = \\frac{34}{35} $$\n\n4.  **False Omission Rate (FOR)**: The probability that an individual has the disease given a negative test result, $P(D+|T-)$.\n    $$ \\mathrm{FOR} = P(D+|T-) = \\frac{\\text{Number}(D+ \\cap T-)}{\\text{Number}(T-)} = \\frac{FN}{TN+FN} = \\frac{180}{6120+180} = \\frac{180}{6300} = \\frac{18}{630} = \\frac{1}{35} $$\n\nNext, we interpret the relationships between these pairs of metrics.\n- For the population of individuals who test positive, there are only two possibilities: they either have the disease (a true positive) or they do not (a false positive). These two outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. Therefore, the sum of their probabilities must equal $1$. This is the relationship between PPV and FDR.\n$$ \\mathrm{PPV} + \\mathrm{FDR} = P(D+|T+) + P(D-|T+) = 1 $$\nOur calculated values confirm this: $\\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{5}{5} = 1$.\n\n- Similarly, for the population of individuals who test negative, they either do not have the disease (a true negative) or they do (a false negative). These outcomes are also mutually exclusive and exhaustive. The sum of their probabilities must equal $1$. This is the relationship between NPV and FOR. Note that FOR is defined as $P(D+|T-)$.\n$$ \\mathrm{NPV} + \\mathrm{FOR} = P(D-|T-) + P(D+|T-) = 1 $$\nOur calculated values confirm this: $\\frac{34}{35} + \\frac{1}{35} = \\frac{35}{35} = 1$.\n\nFinally, we must compute the scalar $R$.\n$$ R = \\frac{\\mathrm{PPV}+\\mathrm{NPV}}{\\mathrm{FDR}+\\mathrm{FOR}} $$\nWe substitute the fractional values we computed to maintain precision.\nThe numerator is:\n$$ \\mathrm{PPV} + \\mathrm{NPV} = \\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{34}{35} = \\frac{3 \\times 7}{5 \\times 7} + \\frac{34}{35} = \\frac{21}{35} + \\frac{34}{35} = \\frac{55}{35} $$\nThe denominator is:\n$$ \\mathrm{FDR} + \\mathrm{FOR} = \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{1}{35} = \\frac{2 \\times 7}{5 \\times 7} + \\frac{1}{35} = \\frac{14}{35} + \\frac{1}{35} = \\frac{15}{35} $$\nNow we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\frac{55}{35}}{\\frac{15}{35}} = \\frac{55}{15} $$\nThis fraction can be reduced by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $5$.\n$$ R = \\frac{55 \\div 5}{15 \\div 5} = \\frac{11}{3} $$\nThe final value of $R$ is $\\frac{11}{3}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{11}{3}}$$", "id": "4622628"}, {"introduction": "While studies provide raw data, in practice we often work with a test's established performance characteristics.

It measures the test's ability to correctly identify individuals with the disease. In probabilistic terms, it is the conditional probability of a positive test ($T^+$) given the presence of disease ($D$):\n$$ \\text{Sensitivity} = P(T^+ | D) $$\n\n- **Specificity**: Specificity is the probability that the assay will yield a negative result, given that the individual being tested truly does not have the disease.
