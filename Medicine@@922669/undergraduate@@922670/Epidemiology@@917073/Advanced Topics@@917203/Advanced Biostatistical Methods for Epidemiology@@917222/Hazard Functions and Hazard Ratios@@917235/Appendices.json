This first practice explores a foundational scenario where the risk of an event is constant over time.

Do not include any unit in your final answer.", "solution": "The problem statement is internally consistent, scientifically grounded in the principles of epidemiology and survival analysis, and well-posed. The assumptions provided are standard for modeling event-time data and are sufficient to derive the requested quantities.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the definitions of the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and the hazard ratio (HR) and their relationship under the specified conditions. We are given two arms of a study, $A$ and $B$, with constant event rate parameters $\\lambda_A$ and $\\lambda_B$, respectively.\n\nFirst, we define the incidence rate ($IR$). The incidence rate is the number of new events per unit of person-time. Under the assumption (i) of a time-homogeneous Poisson process, the rate parameter $\\lambda_k$ for arm $k \\in \\{A, B\\}$ is precisely this quantity. The expected number of events in an interval of person-time $\\Delta T$ is $\\lambda_k \\Delta T$. Therefore, the theoretical incidence rates for the two arms are equal to their respective Poisson rate parameters:\n$$IR_A = \\lambda_A$$\n$$IR_B = \\lambda_B$$\n\nThe incidence rate ratio (IRR) is defined as the ratio of the incidence rates in the two arms. Using the expressions above, we have:\n$$IRR = \\frac{IR_A}{IR_B} = \\frac{\\lambda_A}{\\lambda_B}$$\n\nNext, we define the hazard function and the hazard ratio (HR). The hazard function, $h(t)$, represents the instantaneous risk of an event at time $t$, given survival up to time $t$. It is formally defined as the ratio of the probability density function $f(t)$ to the survival function $S(t)$:\n$$h(t) = \\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}$$\nwhere $S(t) = P(T  t)$ and $f(t) = -\\frac{d}{dt}S(t)$.\n\nAssumption (ii) states that the time to the first event is exponentially distributed. For an exponential distribution with rate parameter $\\lambda_k$, the survival function is given by:\n$$S_k(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda_k t)$$\nThe corresponding probability density function is:\n$$f_k(t) = -\\frac{d}{dt} \\exp(-\\lambda_k t) = -(-\\lambda_k) \\exp(-\\lambda_k t) = \\lambda_k \\exp(-\\lambda_k t)$$\n\nUsing these, we can find the hazard function for each arm $k$:\n$$h_k(t) = \\frac{f_k(t)}{S_k(t)} = \\frac{\\lambda_k \\exp(-\\lambda_k t)}{\\exp(-\\lambda_k t)} = \\lambda_k$$\nThis demonstrates a fundamental property of the exponential distribution: its hazard function is constant over time and equal to its rate parameter. This condition is also known as a \"constant hazard\" model. The problem states that the hazard function is equal to the arm-specific rate parameter, which is consistent with this derivation.\nThus, for the two arms, we have:\n$$h_A(t) = \\lambda_A$$\n$$h_B(t) = \\lambda_B$$\n\nThe hazard ratio (HR) is the ratio of the hazard functions of the two arms. In this case, since the hazard functions are constant, the hazard ratio is also constant:\n$$HR(t) = HR = \\frac{h_A(t)}{h_B(t)} = \\frac{\\lambda_A}{\\lambda_B}$$\nThis situation, where the ratio of hazard functions is a constant, is the defining characteristic of the proportional hazards model, which is satisfied here in its simplest form.\n\nTo verify whether the IRR and HR are equal, we compare their derived expressions:\n$$IRR = \\frac{\\lambda_A}{\\lambda_B}$$\n$$HR = \\frac{\\lambda_A}{\\lambda_B}$$\nIt is evident that $IRR = HR$. This equality is a direct mathematical consequence of the assumption of a constant hazard rate (or equivalently, a time-homogeneous Poisson process for events and an exponential distribution for time-to-event). The assumptions about censoring (iii) ensure that these theoretical quantities could be estimated without bias from study data, reinforcing the validity of the model but not entering the theoretical calculation itself.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value for this common ratio using the given rate parameters $\\lambda_A = 0.02$ per year and $\\lambda_B = 0.01$ per year.\n$$IRR = HR = \\frac{0.02}{0.01} = 2$$\nThe problem requires the final value to be rounded to four significant figures.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in survival analysis with a complete and consistent set of givens. The solution proceeds by applying the fundamental principles that connect hazard, cumulative hazard, and survival functions within the framework of a proportional hazards model.\n\nThe survival probability at time $t$, denoted $S(t)$, is derived from the hazard function, $h(t)$, via the cumulative hazard function, $H(t)$. The governing first principles are:\n1. The cumulative hazard function, $H(t)$, is the integral of the hazard function $h(u)$ over the interval from $0$ to $t$:\n$$H(t) = \\int_0^t h(u) du$$\n2. The survival function, $S(t)$, is related to the cumulative hazard function by:\n$$S(t) = \\exp(-H(t))$$\n\nThe problem specifies a proportional hazards model, where the hazard function for an individual, $h(t)$, is a constant multiple of a baseline hazard function, $h_0(t)$.

The individual's age is $60$ years, which is $10$ years above the reference. This constitutes $\\frac{60 - 50}{5} = 2$ such increments.

A hazard ratio is the ratio of the hazard in one group to the hazard in a reference group, holding all other covariates constant.\n\nFirst, let's compute the numerator of the required quantity: \"HR of $E=1$ vs $E=0$ when $M=1$\". This is the hazard ratio for the exposure among current smokers.\nThe hazard for an exposed smoker ($E=1, M=1$) is:\n$$\nh(t \\mid E=1, M=1, W) \\;=\\; h_{0}(t)\\,\\exp\\left(\\beta_{E}(1) \\;+\\; \\beta_{M}(1) \\;+\\; \\beta_{EM}(1)(1) \\;+\\; \\gamma^{\\top}W\\right) \\;=\\; h_{0}(t)\\,\\exp\\left(\\beta_{E} + \\beta_{M} + \\beta_{EM} + \\gamma^{\\top}W\\right)\n$$\nThe hazard for an unexposed smoker ($E=0, M=1$), who serves as the reference group here, is:\n$$\nh(t \\mid E=0, M=1, W) \\;=\\; h_{0}(t)\\,\\exp\\left(\\beta_{E}(0) \\;+\\; \\beta_{M}(1) \\;+\\; \\beta_{EM}(0)(1) \\;+\\; \\gamma^{\\top}W\\right) \\;=\\; h_{0}(t)\\,\\exp\\left(\\beta_{M} + \\gamma^{\\top}W\\right)\n$$\nThe hazard ratio is the ratio of these two hazards:\n$$\n\\text{HR}_{M=1} = \\frac{h(t \\mid E=1, M=1, W)}{h(t \\mid E=0, M=1, W)} \\;=\\; \\frac{h_{0}(t)\\,\\exp\\left(\\beta_{E} + \\beta_{M} + \\beta_{EM} + \\gamma^{\\top}W\\right)}{h_{0}(t)\\,\\exp\\left(\\beta_{M} + \\gamma^{\\top}W\\right)}\n$$\nBy the properties of exponents, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\text{HR}_{M=1} = \\exp\\left((\\beta_{E} + \\beta_{M} + \\beta_{EM} + \\gamma^{\\top}W) - (\\beta_{M} + \\gamma^{\\top}W)\\right) \\;=\\; \\exp(\\beta_{E} + \\beta_{EM})\n$$\nNotice that the baseline hazard $h_{0}(t)$ and the terms for the modifier $M$ and confounders $W$ cancel out.\n\nNext, we compute the denominator of the required quantity: \"HR of $E=1$ vs $E=0$ when $M=0$\".
