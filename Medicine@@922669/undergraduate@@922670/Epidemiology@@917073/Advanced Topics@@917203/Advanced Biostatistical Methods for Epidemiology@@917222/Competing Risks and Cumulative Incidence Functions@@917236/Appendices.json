Investigators sometimes estimate the probability of failing from cause $k$ by treating all competing causes as right-censoring and then applying the Kaplan–Meier (KM) estimator; however, this practice does not generally recover the appropriate probability of failing from cause $k$ in the presence of competing risks.

We will proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Bias Expression\n\nLet $T$ be the time to the first event and $K$ be the type of event, where $K \\in \\{1, 2, ..., m\\}$. We are interested in event type $k$. The cause-specific hazard function for an event of type $j$ is defined as:\n$$ \\lambda_j(t) = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{P(t \\le T < t+\\Delta t, K=j | T \\ge t)}{\\Delta t} $$\nThis represents the instantaneous rate of failure from cause $j$ at time $t$, given survival up to time $t$.\n\nThe overall hazard of failure from any cause is the sum of the cause-specific hazards:\n$$ \\lambda(t) = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\lambda_j(t) $$\nThe overall survival function, $S(t)$, which is the probability of being free of any event up to time $t$, is related to the overall hazard function by:\n$$ S(t) = P(T > t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^t \\lambda(u) du\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^t \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\lambda_j(u) du\\right) $$\n\n**The Proper Estimand: The Cumulative Incidence Function (CIF)**\n\nThe proper quantity of interest is the cumulative incidence of cause $k$, denoted $I_k(t)$. This is the probability that an individual has failed from cause $k$ by time $t$. It is defined as $I_k(t) = P(T \\le t, K=k)$. To derive its expression, we consider the probability density of failing from cause $k$ at time $u$, which is the product of the cause-specific hazard $\\lambda_k(u)$ and the probability of surviving until that time, $S(u)$. Integrating this density from $0$ to $t$ gives the cumulative probability:\n$$ I_k(t) = \\int_0^t \\lambda_k(u) S(u) du $$\nSubstituting the expression for $S(u)$, we get:\n$$ I_k(t) = \\int_0^t \\lambda_k(u) \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^u \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\lambda_j(v) dv\\right) du $$\nThis is the true probability of failure from cause $k$ in the presence of competing events.\n\n**The Asymptotic Target of the Kaplan–Meier Estimator**\n\nWhen competing events are incorrectly treated as right-censoring, the Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimator is applied only to the event times for cause $k$. This procedure implicitly assumes that competing events are an independent censoring process. The KM estimator's asymptotic target in this context is not the CIF, but rather the failure probability in a hypothetical world where only cause $k$ exists.\n\nLet us denote this target quantity as $KM_k^*(t)$. It corresponds to $1$ minus the survival function associated solely with the hazard of cause $k$. Let this survival function be $S_k(t)$.\n$$ S_k(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^t \\lambda_k(u) du\\right) $$\nThis represents the probability of not failing from cause $k$ by time $t$, assuming no other causes of failure exist. The asymptotic target of the KM analysis is therefore:\n$$ KM_k^*(t) = 1 - S_k(t) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^t \\lambda_k(u) du\\right) $$\n\n**The Bias Expression**\n\nThe bias of the Kaplan-Meier approach at time $t$, denoted $B(t)$, is the difference between its asymptotic target and the true cumulative incidence.\n$$ B(t) = KM_k^*(t) - I_k(t) $$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $KM_k^*(t)$ and $I_k(t)$:\n$$ B(t) = \\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^t \\lambda_k(u) du\\right)\\right] - \\left[\\int_0^t \\lambda_k(u) \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^u \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\lambda_j(v) dv\\right) du\\right] $$\nTo make the dependency on competing risks explicit, we can separate the sum of hazards: $\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\lambda_j(v) = \\lambda_k(v) + \\sum_{j \\neq k} \\lambda_j(v)$. Let the set of competing causes be denoted by indices $j \\neq k$. The bias is:\n$$ B(t) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^t \\lambda_k(u) du\\right) - \\int_0^t \\lambda_k(u) \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^u \\left[\\lambda_k(v) + \\sum_{j \\neq k} \\lambda_j(v)\\right] dv\\right) du $$\nThis is the general closed-form expression for the bias. This bias is always non-negative because the presence of competing risks reduces the number of individuals at risk for cause $k$, thereby reducing the true cumulative incidence $I_k(t)$ compared to the hypothetical quantity $KM_k^*(t)$.\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Calculation for the Parametric Scenario\n\nWe are given a scenario with constant hazards over time. The cause of interest $k$ has hazard $\\lambda_k(t) = \\lambda_k = 0.2$ per year. The set of competing causes consists of a single cause $c$ with hazard $\\lambda_c(t) = \\lambda_c = 0.8$ per year. We evaluate the bias at time $t=1$ year.\n\nFirst, we calculate the KM target, $KM_k^*(t)$, for $t=1$.\n$$ \\int_0^t \\lambda_k du = \\lambda_k t $$\n$$ KM_k^*(1) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_k \\times 1) = 1 - \\exp(-0.2) $$\n\nNext, we calculate the true cumulative incidence, $I_k(t)$, for $t=1$. The overall hazard is $\\lambda(t) = \\lambda_k + \\lambda_c = 0.2 + 0.8 = 1.0$.\n$$ I_k(t) = \\int_0^t \\lambda_k S(u) du = \\int_0^t \\lambda_k \\exp(-(\\lambda_k+\\lambda_c)u) du $$\nThis integral evaluates to:\n$$ I_k(t) = \\lambda_k \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(-(\\lambda_k+\\lambda_c)u)}{-(\\lambda_k+\\lambda_c)} \\right]_0^t = \\frac{\\lambda_k}{\\lambda_k+\\lambda_c} \\left(1 - \\exp(-(\\lambda_k+\\lambda_c)t)\\right) $$\nSubstituting the values for $t=1$:\n$$ I_k(1) = \\frac{0.2}{0.2+0.8} \\left(1 - \\exp(-(0.2+0.8) \\times 1)\\right) = \\frac{0.2}{1.0} \\left(1 - \\exp(-1)\\right) = 0.2(1 - \\exp(-1)) $$\n\nFinally, we compute the bias at $t=1$:\n$$ B(1) = KM_k^*(1) - I_k(1) = \\left[1 - \\exp(-0.2)\\right] - \\left[0.2(1 - \\exp(-1))\\right] $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values of the exponential functions:\n$$ \\exp(-0.2) \\approx 0.81873075 $$\n$$ \\exp(-1) \\approx 0.36787944 $$\n$$ KM_k^*(1) \\approx 1 - 0.81873075 = 0.18126925 $$\n$$ I_k(1) \\approx 0.2 \\times (1 - 0.36787944) = 0.2 \\times 0.63212056 = 0.12642411 $$\nThe bias is the difference:\n$$ B(1) \\approx 0.18126925 - 0.12642411 = 0.05484514 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the bias is $0.05485$.
