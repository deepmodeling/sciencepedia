## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The theoretical principles of competing risks and cumulative incidence functions, as detailed in the previous chapter, find extensive and critical application across a multitude of scientific disciplines. Understanding these principles is not merely an academic exercise; it is essential for the correct interpretation of time-to-event data in any real-world setting where individuals are at risk for more than one type of outcome. This chapter will explore a range of these applications, demonstrating how the core concepts are utilized to answer practical questions in clinical medicine, public health, epidemiology, and even emerging fields like [algorithmic fairness](@entry_id:143652). Our focus will be on bridging the gap between theory and practice, illustrating the utility and versatility of the [competing risks](@entry_id:173277) framework.

### Core Applications in Clinical Medicine and Public Health

The most direct and widespread application of [competing risks analysis](@entry_id:634319) is in clinical medicine, where researchers and clinicians seek to quantify the risk of a specific disease outcome in the presence of other potential events, most notably death from other causes.

In clinical oncology, for example, a primary goal is to estimate the probability of a patient dying from a specific cancer. Consider the challenge of estimating melanoma-specific mortality in an elderly patient cohort. In this population, death from non-melanoma causes, such as cardiovascular disease, is frequent. A naive analytical approach might treat these non-melanoma deaths as censored observations and apply the standard Kaplan-Meier (KM) method to estimate survival from melanoma. The complement of the KM survival curve, $1 - S_{KM}(t)$, is then interpreted as the probability of melanoma death. This approach is fundamentally flawed because it estimates the *net risk*—the risk of melanoma death in a hypothetical world where no other causes of death exist. By failing to account for the fact that patients who die from other causes are permanently removed from the population at risk for melanoma death, the KM method systematically overestimates the true, or *crude*, probability. The correct approach is to use the cumulative incidence function (CIF), which is defined as $F_k(t) = \int_0^t S(u) \lambda_k(u) du$, where $S(u)$ is the overall survival from all causes and $\lambda_k(u)$ is the cause-specific hazard for melanoma. The CIF properly accounts for all competing events and provides an unbiased estimate of the probability of melanoma death in the actual population under study. In a hypothetical cohort where the hazard of non-melanoma death is significant, the KM method might erroneously estimate the 5-year melanoma mortality to be over $0.22$, whereas the correct CIF-based calculation would yield a more realistic probability of approximately $0.176$ [@problem_id:4455668].

This principle extends far beyond oncology. In the field of transplantation surgery, such as Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation (VCA), clinicians need to understand the probability of graft loss. Here, death with a functioning graft is a critical competing event. Estimating the probability of graft loss using the KM method by censoring deaths would again lead to an overestimation of the graft loss risk. The CIF is the appropriate tool to quantify the actual probability of graft loss that a patient faces, a crucial piece of information for counseling and clinical management [@problem_id:5199111]. Similarly, in pediatric oncology, a child in remission from Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) faces several competing outcomes: relapse, death without relapse, and the development of a second malignant neoplasm. The CIF allows for the specific estimation of the probability of relapse, while a related but distinct concept, relapse-free survival (RFS), is often defined as survival from a composite endpoint of *any* of these adverse events. The hazard for RFS is the sum of the cause-specific hazards for all component events, $\lambda_{RFS}(t) = \lambda_{Relapse}(t) + \lambda_{Death}(t) + \lambda_{Second \: Neoplasm}(t)$, and it must be distinguished from the CIF, which pertains to only one of these causes [@problem_id:5094858].

The competing risks framework is equally vital in public health and gerontology for studying non-fatal events. For instance, when studying a cohort of older adults, researchers may be interested in the incidence of functional disability. However, death is a competing risk, as a person who dies can no longer become disabled. To accurately project the population burden of disability, analysts must use CIFs calculated from piecewise hazard models that account for changes in both disability and mortality risk over time [@problem_id:4388874] [@problem_id:4652982].

One of the most important and sometimes counter-intuitive insights from [competing risks analysis](@entry_id:634319) relates to [policy evaluation](@entry_id:136637). Consider a public health intervention designed to reduce hospitalizations. The policy may successfully lower the cause-specific hazard of hospitalization, $\lambda_h$. However, because fewer people are being hospitalized, a larger proportion of the population remains at risk for other outcomes, such as death. If the death hazard, $\lambda_d$, remains unchanged, the cumulative incidence of death may paradoxically *increase* post-intervention. This is not because the policy is harmful with respect to mortality risk, but because by preventing one outcome, it allows more time for the competing outcome to occur. This highlights the critical need for policy analysts to evaluate the impact on all relevant competing outcomes using CIFs, rather than relying solely on changes in cause-specific hazards [@problem_id:4545089].

### Bridging Etiology and Prognosis: Advanced Epidemiological Interpretation

Epidemiological research often has two distinct aims: an *etiologic* aim, focused on understanding the direct causal effect of a risk factor on the biological process of a disease, and a *prognostic* aim, focused on predicting the actual course of disease and absolute risk in a population. The competing risks framework provides distinct tools for each of these aims.

- **Etiology:** Etiologic questions are best addressed using **cause-specific hazard (CSH)** models, such as the standard Cox [proportional hazards model](@entry_id:171806). The CSH for an event is the instantaneous rate of that event among those who are currently alive and event-free. A hazard ratio from a CSH model quantifies the effect of an exposure on this instantaneous rate. For example, in studying the effect of optimism on the risk of stroke, a CSH model would assess whether optimism directly modifies the rate of stroke occurrence at any given moment among those still alive and stroke-free [@problem_id:4727212].

- **Prognosis:** Prognostic questions about a patient's absolute risk over a period (e.g., the 10-year probability of stroke) must account for competing risks like death. The appropriate tool here is the **Cumulative Incidence Function (CIF)**. To model the effect of covariates on the CIF, researchers often use models for the **subdistribution hazard (SDH)**, such as the Fine-Gray model. The resulting subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) quantifies the effect of an exposure on the cumulative incidence.

It is a common and serious error to misinterpret the output of these models. A cause-specific hazard ratio (csHR) from a Cox model is fundamentally different from a risk ratio of CIFs. A csHR of $2.0$ for an exposure does not mean the 5-year cumulative incidence of the event will be twice as high in the exposed group. The CIF is a function of both the cause-specific hazard of interest *and* the cause-specific hazards of all [competing risks](@entry_id:173277) (as they determine the overall survival probability). An exposure might increase the CSH for the event of interest but also strongly increase the CSH for a competing event, leading to a much smaller effect, no effect, or even a reverse effect on the CIF. The csHR and the CIF risk ratio will only align approximately under the "rare event assumption"—when the overall probability of any event is very low, the impact of competing events is minimal, and the at-risk populations in different exposure groups remain similar over time [@problem_id:4579878].

### Competing Risks in Evidence-Based Medicine and Clinical Trials

The principles of competing risks are paramount in the design and analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs), the gold standard for medical evidence.

When analyzing an RCT, the **intention-to-treat (ITT)** principle requires that participants be analyzed in the group to which they were randomized, regardless of adherence. The causal estimand in an ITT analysis is the effect of *assignment* to a treatment. In the presence of competing risks, the primary ITT estimand is often the difference in the CIFs between the treatment and control arms at a specific time point: $RD_{CR}(t) = F_1^{(T)}(t) - F_1^{(C)}(t)$. This quantity represents the absolute difference in risk for the event of interest, accounting for all competing events, and it can be directly estimated using [non-parametric methods](@entry_id:138925) like the Aalen-Johansen estimator or modeled using regression on the subdistribution hazard (e.g., a Fine-Gray model with the treatment assignment as the covariate) [@problem_id:4603106].

Standard metrics used in evidence-based medicine, such as the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) and Number Needed to Harm (NNH), must also be adapted for [competing risks](@entry_id:173277). These metrics are based on the absolute risk difference. Therefore, the correct, time-specific definitions are:
$$ NNT_{CR}(t) = \frac{1}{|RD_{CR}(t)|} = \frac{1}{|F_1^{(T)}(t) - F_1^{(C)}(t)|} $$
Using a risk difference derived from biased Kaplan-Meier estimates will produce an incorrect and misleading NNT or NNH. For instance, in a trial of a new anticoagulant where the new drug increases the risk of major bleeding, the naive KM-based approach would overestimate the risk in both arms. This can lead to a larger apparent risk difference and a smaller (more alarming) NNH. A hypothetical analysis might yield a naive $NNH(2) \approx 33$, while the correct competing-risks-based calculation gives $NNH^{CR}(2) = 50$, providing a more accurate assessment of the treatment's harm profile [@problem_id:4819133] [@problem_id:4836828].

### Advanced Modeling and Interdisciplinary Connections

The [competing risks](@entry_id:173277) framework has spurred the development of specialized statistical models and continues to find new applications in diverse fields.

A cornerstone of modern [competing risks analysis](@entry_id:634319) is the **Fine-Gray model**, a semiparametric regression model for the subdistribution hazard. Its key innovation is the construction of the risk set. Unlike in a cause-specific Cox model where individuals are removed from the risk set upon experiencing *any* event, in the Fine-Gray model for a specific cause, individuals who experience a *competing* event remain in the risk set (often managed through specific [data weighting](@entry_id:635715) schemes in software). This unique construction allows the model's coefficients to directly relate to the cumulative incidence function, making it the preferred tool for prognostic modeling of CIFs [@problem_id:4579837].

The principles also inform other epidemiological methods. When comparing outcomes between populations (e.g., hospitals), it is often necessary to standardize for [confounding variables](@entry_id:199777) like age. Because the CIF is a risk (a probability), it is appropriate to use **direct standardization**, where stratum-specific CIFs are averaged using the weights of a standard population. It is inappropriate to average the subdistribution hazards and then transform this average rate into a risk, as the non-linear relationship between hazards and risks means this will not yield the same result as directly standardizing the risks themselves [@problem_id:4953680].

Most recently, the language of competing risks is being used to address cutting-edge challenges in **[algorithmic fairness](@entry_id:143652)**. Health systems are increasingly deploying algorithms to predict patient risk and guide interventions. A key fairness criterion, **equalized odds**, requires that a model's [true positive rate](@entry_id:637442) and false positive rate be equal across different demographic groups (e.g., race or gender). In a time-to-event setting, the "true outcome" is the occurrence of the event of interest by a specific time horizon. This can be precisely defined using the CIF. For instance, a system can be evaluated for fairness by comparing the CIFs for the event of interest across different groups, providing a rigorous, quantitative framework for auditing algorithms for bias in the presence of competing risks [@problem_id:4824171]. The ability to estimate causal effects in [competing risks](@entry_id:173277) settings, especially from observational data using advanced g-methods, is also critical for both developing and auditing these algorithms [@problem_id:4545089].

In summary, the theory of competing risks is not an isolated statistical curiosity. It is a fundamental and indispensable framework for anyone working with time-to-event data. From estimating a cancer patient's prognosis to evaluating public health policy, ensuring fairness in AI, and correctly interpreting clinical trials, the principles of cause-specific hazards and cumulative incidence functions are essential for generating accurate, interpretable, and actionable scientific evidence.
