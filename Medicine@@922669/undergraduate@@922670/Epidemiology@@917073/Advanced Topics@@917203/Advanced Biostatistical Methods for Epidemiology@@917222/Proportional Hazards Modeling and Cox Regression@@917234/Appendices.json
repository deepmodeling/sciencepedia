The hazard for individual $i$ at time $t$ given a time-independent covariate $X_{i}$ is $h_{i}(t \\mid X_{i}) = h_{0}(t) \\exp(\\beta X_{i})$, where $h_{0}(t)$ is an unspecified baseline hazard and $\\beta$ is an unknown regression coefficient to be estimated.\n\nAdopt counting-process notation: define the counting process $N_{i}(t)$ that jumps by $1$ at the event time for individual $i$ and remains flat otherwise, and the at-risk indicator process $Y_{i}(t)$ that equals $1$ if individual $i$ is under observation and event-free just prior to time $t$, and equals $0$ otherwise.

Your final answer must be a single expression.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the partial likelihood function, $L(\\beta)$, for a given dataset under the Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) model. The derivation will proceed from the fundamental definition of the partial likelihood in the context of counting processes.\n\nThe CPH model specifies the hazard for individual $i$ at time $t$ as $h_{i}(t \\mid X_{i}) = h_{0}(t) \\exp(\\beta X_{i})$, where $h_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard, $X_i$ is a covariate, and $\\beta$ is the coefficient to be estimated. In the counting process framework, the intensity of the process $N_i(t)$ for individual $i$ is given by $\\lambda_i(t) = Y_i(t) h_i(t \\mid X_i) = Y_i(t) h_0(t) \\exp(\\beta X_i)$. Here, $Y_i(t)$ is the at-risk indicator, which is $1$ if individual $i$ is at risk (under observation and event-free) just before time $t$, and $0$ otherwise.\n\nThe partial likelihood, proposed by D.R. Cox, is constructed by considering the conditional probability of observing the actual individual experiencing an event at each event time, given the set of individuals at risk at that time and the fact that an event occurred. Let the ordered distinct event times be $t_1 < t_2 < \\dots < t_k$. Let $d_j$ be the index of the individual who experiences the event at time $t_j$. The risk set at time $t_j$, denoted $R(t_j)$, is the set of all individuals $i$ who are at risk just before $t_j$, i.e., $R(t_j) = \\{i \\mid Y_i(t_j) = 1\\}$.\n\nThe contribution to the partial likelihood at event time $t_j$ is the conditional probability that individual $d_j$ fails, given that exactly one failure occurs at $t_j$ among the subjects in $R(t_j)$. This probability is given by the ratio of the hazard of individual $d_j$ to the sum of hazards of all individuals in the risk set:\n$$ L_j(\\beta) = \\frac{h_{d_j}(t_j \\mid X_{d_j})}{\\sum_{i \\in R(t_j)} h_i(t_j \\mid X_i)} $$\nSubstituting the CPH model form $h_i(t_j \\mid X_i) = h_0(t_j)\\exp(\\beta X_i)$:\n$$ L_j(\\beta) = \\frac{h_0(t_j) \\exp(\\beta X_{d_j})}{\\sum_{i \\in R(t_j)} h_0(t_j) \\exp(\\beta X_i)} $$\nThe baseline hazard term $h_0(t_j)$ is common to both the numerator and all terms in the denominator's sum, thus it cancels out. This is the key insight of the partial likelihood, as it allows for estimation of $\\beta$ without specifying or estimating $h_0(t)$.\n$$ L_j(\\beta) = \\frac{\\exp(\\beta X_{d_j})}{\\sum_{i \\in R(t_j)} \\exp(\\beta X_i)} $$\nThe total partial likelihood $L(\\beta)$ is the product of these conditional probabilities over all observed event times, assuming independence between these conditional probabilities.\n$$ L(\\beta) = \\prod_{j=1}^{k} L_j(\\beta) = \\prod_{j=1}^{k} \\frac{\\exp(\\beta X_{d_j})}{\\sum_{i \\in R(t_j)} \\exp(\\beta X_i)} $$\nNow we apply this principle to the specific data provided for the $4$ individuals.\n\nThe dataset is:\n- Individual $1$: Enters at $t=0$, $X_1 = 1$, event at $t=2$.\n- Individual $2$: Enters at $t=1$, $X_2 = 0$, event at $t=5$.\n- Individual $3$: Enters at $t=0$, $X_3 = 1$, censored at $t=4$.\n- Individual $4$: Enters at $t=3$, $X_4 = 0$, censored at $t=6$.\n\nThe observed event times are $t=2$ and $t=5$.
