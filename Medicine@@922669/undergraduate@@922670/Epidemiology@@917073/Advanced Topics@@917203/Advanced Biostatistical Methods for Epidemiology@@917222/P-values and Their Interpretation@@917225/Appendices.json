This problem [@problem_id:1942522] presents a scenario where you are given a confidence interval and asked to deduce the outcome of a hypothesis test. This practice illustrates the powerful duality between these two fundamental tools of inference, a concept that is essential for critically evaluating scientific findings.", "problem": "A team of environmental scientists is investigating the concentration of a certain pollutant in a lake. They collect a large number of water samples and construct a 95% confidence interval for the true mean concentration, $\\mu$, of the pollutant. The resulting confidence interval is found to be $[18.4, 21.6]$ parts per million (ppm).\n\nRegulatory guidelines state that the lake is considered safe if the mean pollutant concentration is 17.5 ppm. The scientists decide to perform a two-sided hypothesis test to determine if the lake's mean concentration is different from this safety guideline.

The common practice of using a rigid significance threshold (like $p \\lt 0.05$) can lead to misleading conclusions, creating a false dichotomy between a 'significant effect' and 'no effect'. This final exercise [@problem_id:1942507] challenges you to critique a common but flawed interpretation of two studies with very similar p-values, honing your ability to see beyond arbitrary cutoffs and appreciate the continuous nature of statistical evidence.", "problem": "Two independent medical research teams, Team Alpha and Team Beta, are investigating the effectiveness of a new experimental drug intended to improve cognitive function in patients with mild memory loss. Both teams establish the same null hypothesis ($H_0$), which states that the drug has no effect on cognitive scores compared to a placebo. The corresponding alternative hypothesis ($H_a$) for both is that the drug does have an effect.\n\nAfter conducting their respective randomized controlled trials, Team Alpha reports a p-value of $0.04$ for their primary cognitive endpoint. Team Beta, in their independent study, reports a p-value of $0.06$ for the same endpoint.\n\nA science journalist reviews both studies and writes an article with the headline: \"Conflicting Results on New Memory Drug: Team Alpha Finds a Significant Effect, Team Beta Finds None.\" The article concludes that Team Alpha's study supports the drug's use while Team Beta's study does not.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most statistically sound critique of the journalist's conclusion?\n\nA. The journalist is entirely correct. Using the standard scientific convention of a significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$, Team Alpha's result is statistically significant while Team Beta's is not. Therefore, the studies have produced opposing conclusions.\n\nB. The p-value of $0.04$ indicates there is a 4% probability that the drug is ineffective (the null hypothesis is true), while the p-value of $0.06$ indicates a 6% probability that the drug is ineffective. The journalist is correct that the 4% risk is acceptable but the 6% risk is not.\n\nC. The two p-values are very close to each other and provide a similar weight of evidence against the null hypothesis. The journalist's conclusion of \"a significant effect\" versus \"no effect\" is a poor interpretation that exaggerates the minor difference between the two results.\n\nD. Both studies failed to prove the drug is effective. Since neither p-value is zero, there is still a chance that the observed results were due to random variation, and therefore no conclusions should be drawn from either study.", "solution": "We formalize the hypotheses shared by both studies as $H_{0}$: no drug effect on cognitive scores versus $H_{a}$: some drug effect. A $p$-value is defined as\n$$\np=\\Pr(\\text{test statistic at least as extreme as observed} \\mid H_{0}),\n$$\nwhich quantifies how incompatible the observed data are with $H_{0}$. It is not equal to $\\Pr(H_{0}\\mid \\text{data})$.\n\nA conventional decision rule at significance level $\\alpha$ rejects $H_{0}$ when $p \\le \\alpha$. With $\\alpha=0.05$, Team Alpha’s $p=0.04$ would lead to rejecting $H_{0}$, while Team Beta’s $p=0.06$ would lead to not rejecting $H_{0}$. However, the threshold $\\alpha=0.05$ is arbitrary, and the two $p$-values $0.04$ and $0.06$ are very close, implying similar and weak-to-moderate evidence against $H_{0}$. Treating these results as “opposing” is a dichotomization artifact rather than a substantive difference in evidence.\n\nAssessing the options:\n- Option A appeals to the mechanical $\\alpha=0.05$ rule but incorrectly characterizes the studies as having opposing conclusions; in reality, the evidential strength is similar, and dichotomizing exaggerates differences.\n- Option B misinterprets $p$-values as $\\Pr(H_{0}\\text{ true}\\mid \\text{data})$, which is incorrect; $p$-values are $\\Pr(\\text{data} \\mid H_{0})$-type quantities, not posterior probabilities of $H_{0}$.\n- Option C correctly notes that the two $p$-values are close and provide similar weight of evidence, and that the journalist’s “significant vs none” framing is a poor interpretation that overstates a minor difference.\n- Option D is too strong and misleading: $p$-values virtually never equal zero, and one can still draw graded evidential conclusions; failing to reject $H_{0}$ does not mean “no conclusions,” only that evidence is insufficient at the chosen threshold.\n\nTherefore, the most statistically sound critique is Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1942507"}]}
