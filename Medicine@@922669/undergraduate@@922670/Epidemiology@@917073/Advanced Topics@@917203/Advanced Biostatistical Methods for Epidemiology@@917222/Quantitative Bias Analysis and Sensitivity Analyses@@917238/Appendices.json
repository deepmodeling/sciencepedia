The multiplicative bias model is a standard framework. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and data ($RR_{\\text{obs}}$, the relationship between variables, the range of $B$, and the condition for robustness) to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and precise, using standard terminology. The given values are realistic for an epidemiological study. The problem is complete, consistent, and logically structured.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem statement defines a multiplicative relationship between the observed risk ratio, $RR_{\\text{obs}}$, the true causal risk ratio, $RR_{\\text{true}}$, and the bias factor, $B$. The convention specified states that confounding inflates the observed estimate when $B \\ge 1$. This implies that for a true risk ratio greater than $1$, the observed risk ratio is larger than the true risk ratio. This relationship is mathematically expressed as:\n$$RR_{\\text{obs}} = RR_{\\text{true}} \\times B$$\nThe goal is to determine the robustness region. This region is defined as the set of values for the bias factor $B$, within its specified plausible range, for which the qualitative conclusion about the effect holds. The conclusion is that the true causal risk ratio exceeds the null value, which is mathematically stated as:\n$$RR_{\\text{true}}  1$$\nTo find the set of $B$ values that satisfy this condition, we first express $RR_{\\text{true}}$ in terms of the observables and the bias parameter. By rearranging the multiplicative bias equation, we get:\n$$RR_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{RR_{\\text{obs}}}{B}$$\nNote that since $B$ represents a bias factor and its plausible range is given as $B \\in [1, 2]$, $B$ is strictly positive, so this division is well-defined.\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $RR_{\\text{true}}$ into the inequality that defines the robustness condition:\n$$\\frac{RR_{\\text{obs}}}{B}  1$$\nWe are given that the observed risk ratio is $RR_{\\text{obs}} = 1.8$. Substituting this value into the inequality yields:\n$$\\frac{1.8}{B}  1$$\nTo solve for $B$, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by $B$. Since we know $B \\ge 1$, $B$ is a positive quantity, and multiplying by it will not reverse the inequality sign:\n$$1.8  B$$\nThis inequality, $B  1.8$, defines the condition on the bias factor for the true risk ratio to remain above the null value of $1$.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the robustness region, which is the subset of the analyst's plausible range for $B$ that satisfies this condition. The plausible range for $B$ is given as the closed interval $[1, 2]$. We must find the intersection of the set of values defined by $B  1.8$ and the set of values defined by $B \\in [1, 2]$.\n\nThe set of values satisfying both conditions is:\n$$B \\in [1, 2] \\cap (-\\infty, 1.8)$$\nThe intersection of these two sets is the interval $[1, 1.8)$. This interval represents the robustness region for the bias factor $B$. For any value of $B$ within this region, the qualitative conclusion that the true effect is present ($RR_{\\text{true}}  1$) remains unchanged. If the true bias factor were to be $1.8$ or greater, the conclusion would be overturned ($RR_{\\text{true}} \\le 1$).\n\nThe problem asks for the ordered pair of the lower and upper endpoints of this robustness region. The lower endpoint of the interval $[1, 1.8)$ is $1$. The upper endpoint is $1.8$.\nTherefore, the endpoints are $1$ and $1.8$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1  1.8 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4832387"}, {"introduction": "While the previous exercise explored the general concept of a bias threshold, this practice introduces a standardized and widely used metric: the E-value.

Investigators are concerned about the credibility of causal claims through the lens of the Bradford Hill criteria and wish to assess robustness to a single unmeasured confounder using quantitative sensitivity analysis.\n\nTasks:\n- Explain, at a high level, how quantitative sensitivity analyses that use bias parameters on the risk ratio scale help maintain credibility with respect to the Bradford Hill criteria when some confounding may be unmeasured. Your explanation should connect the role of quantifying potential bias to at least one of the Bradford Hill viewpoints.\n- Starting only from the core definitions of confounding on the risk ratio scale and the widely accepted logic that the maximum bias from a single unmeasured confounder can be bounded by functions of its association with the exposure and with the outcome (both on the risk ratio scale), derive a closed-form analytic expression for the minimal equal-strength association, denoted $x$, that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the exposure and the outcome to reduce an observed harmful association $RR_{\\text{obs}}1$ to a true null ($RR_{\\text{true}}=1$).

In the context of the Bradford Hill criteria, the viewpoint of strength is central: stronger associations are less likely to be fully due to uncontrolled confounding. By quantifying the minimal strength of unmeasured confounding (on the risk ratio scale) required to move an observed $RR_{\\text{obs}}$ to the null ($RR_{\\text{true}}=1$), investigators can compare this requirement to empirically plausible confounder associations. If the required confounding is implausibly large given subject-matter knowledge and existing data, the credibility of a causal interpretation is bolstered not only for strength but also indirectly for coherence and consistency, as the observed association then appears robust across reasonable perturbations of assumptions about unmeasured factors.\n\nWe now derive the E-value from first principles used in sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding on the risk ratio scale. Let $U$ denote a single unmeasured confounder. Define the following bias parameters on the risk ratio scale, conditional on measured covariates:\n- $RR_{EU}$ is the association between the exposure and $U$, interpreted as the risk ratio comparing the prevalence (or probability) of $U$ among the exposed versus the unexposed.\n- $RR_{UD}$ is the association between $U$ and the outcome, interpreted as the risk ratio comparing outcome risk for $U=1$ versus $U=0$ within levels of measured covariates and exposure status, under no causal effect of $U$ on exposure.\n\nA well-tested fact in epidemiologic sensitivity analysis (arising from Cornfield-type inequalities and bounding arguments for multiplicative scales) is that the maximum possible multiplicative bias on the observed risk ratio due to a single unmeasured confounder is bounded above by a function of $RR_{EU}$ and $RR_{UD}$. Denote the bias factor by $B$, so that\n$$\nRR_{\\text{obs}} \\leq B \\times RR_{\\text{true}},\n$$\nwith equality in the worst case, and with $B$ increasing in both $RR_{EU}$ and $RR_{UD}$. For the risk ratio scale, a standard and widely accepted bound for the maximum bias factor due to one unmeasured confounder is\n$$\nB \\leq \\frac{RR_{EU}\\,RR_{UD}}{RR_{EU} + RR_{UD} - 1}.\n$$\nTo explain away an observed harmful association, we require that the worst-case confounding could reduce $RR_{\\text{obs}}$ down to $RR_{\\text{true}}=1$. In the most conservative (worst-case) scenario, this corresponds to requiring\n$$\nB \\geq RR_{\\text{obs}}.\n$$\nWe seek the minimal equal-strength associations that achieve this, which is conservative in the sense of minimizing the largest of the two bias parameters. Therefore, set\n$$\nRR_{EU} = RR_{UD} = x,\n$$\nand impose the condition that the maximum bias equals the observed risk ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{x^{2}}{2x - 1} = RR_{\\text{obs}}.\n$$\nSolving for $x$ in terms of $RR_{\\text{obs}}$ gives a quadratic equation:\n$$\nx^{2} = RR_{\\text{obs}}(2x - 1) \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad x^{2} - 2RR_{\\text{obs}}\\,x + RR_{\\text{obs}} = 0.\n$$\nUsing the quadratic formula for $x$,\n$$\nx = \\frac{2RR_{\\text{obs}} \\pm \\sqrt{4RR_{\\text{obs}}^{2} - 4RR_{\\text{obs}}}}{2}\n= RR_{\\text{obs}} \\pm \\sqrt{RR_{\\text{obs}}\\,(RR_{\\text{obs}} - 1)}.\n$$\nSince $x$ represents a risk ratio and must satisfy $x \\geq 1$, the relevant root is the larger one.
