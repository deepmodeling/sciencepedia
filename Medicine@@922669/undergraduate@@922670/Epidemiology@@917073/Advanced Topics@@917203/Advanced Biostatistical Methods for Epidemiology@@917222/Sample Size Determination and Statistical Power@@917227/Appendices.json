Determine the Rejection Region under the Null Hypothesis**\nThe test is based on the difference in sample proportions, $D = \\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2$. Under the CLT, $D$ is approximately normally distributed.\n\nUnder $H_0$, the expected value of the difference is $E[D|H_0] = p_1 - p_2 = 0$. The variance of $D$ under $H_0$ is calculated assuming a common proportion, which the problem specifies to be $p_0$.\nLet's first calculate $p_0$:\n$$p_0 = \\frac{n_1 p_1 + n_2 p_2}{n_1 + n_2} = \\frac{500(0.25) + 500(0.20)}{500 + 500} = \\frac{125 + 100}{1000} = \\frac{225}{1000} = 0.225$$\nThe standard error of the difference under the null hypothesis, $SE_0$, is:\n$$SE_0 = \\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)\\left(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}\\right)}$$\n$$SE_0 = \\sqrt{0.225(1-0.225)\\left(\\frac{1}{500} + \\frac{1}{500}\\right)} = \\sqrt{0.225(0.775)\\left(\\frac{2}{500}\\right)}$$\n$$SE_0 = \\sqrt{0.174375 \\times 0.004} = \\sqrt{0.0006975}$$\nFor a two-sided test with $\\alpha = 0.05$, the critical value from the standard normal distribution is $z_{\\alpha/2} = z_{0.025}$. The standard value used is approximately $1.96$. Using a more precise value, $z_{0.025} \\approx 1.959964$.\nThe null hypothesis is rejected if the absolute value of the observed difference is greater than a critical threshold, $C$:\n$$|\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2| > z_{\\alpha/2} \\times SE_0$$\nSo the rejection region is defined by two critical values:\n$$C_{upper} = z_{\\alpha/2} \\times SE_0 \\approx 1.959964 \\times \\sqrt{0.0006975}$$\n$$C_{lower} = -z_{\\alpha/2} \\times SE_0 \\approx -1.959964 \\times \\sqrt{0.0006975}$$\n\n**3.
