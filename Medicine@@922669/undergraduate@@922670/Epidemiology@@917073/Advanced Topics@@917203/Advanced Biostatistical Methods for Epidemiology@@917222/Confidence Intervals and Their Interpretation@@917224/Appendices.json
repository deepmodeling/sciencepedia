The sample mean is $\\bar{x}=5.1$ and the sample standard deviation is $s=1.9$. We are tasked with constructing a two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval for $\\mu$.\n\nThe foundational principle for constructing this interval is the use of a pivotal quantity, which is a function of the sample data and the parameter of interest whose sampling distribution is known and does not depend on any unknown parameters.\n\nSince the population variance $\\sigma^2$ is unknown, we cannot use the standard normal ($Z$) statistic. Instead, we use the sample standard deviation $s$ as an estimate for $\\sigma$. The resulting pivotal quantity is the $t$-statistic, defined as:\n$$\nT = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu}{S/\\sqrt{n}}\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{X}$ is the sample mean random variable and $S$ is the sample standard deviation random variable. By a fundamental theorem of statistics (originally from W.S. Gosset), this quantity $T$ follows a Student's $t$-distribution with $\\nu = n-1$ degrees of freedom.\n\nFor a two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval, the level of significance is $\\alpha = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$. We need to find the critical values $\\pm t_{\\alpha/2, \\nu}$ from the $t$-distribution with $\\nu = n-1$ degrees of freedom that bound the central $1-\\alpha=0.95$ of the probability mass. This is expressed as:\n$$\nP(-t_{\\alpha/2, \\nu}  T  t_{\\alpha/2, \\nu}) = 1-\\alpha\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $T$, we have:\n$$\nP\\left(-t_{\\alpha/2, \\nu}  \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu}{S/\\sqrt{n}}  t_{\\alpha/2, \\nu}\\right) = 1-\\alpha\n$$\nTo find the interval for $\\mu$, we rearrange the inequalities:\n$$\n-t_{\\alpha/2, \\nu} \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}}  \\bar{X} - \\mu  t_{\\alpha/2, \\nu} \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}}\n$$\n$$\n-\\bar{X} - t_{\\alpha/2, \\nu} \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}}  -\\mu  -\\bar{X} + t_{\\alpha/2, \\nu} \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}}\n$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequalities:\n$$\n\\bar{X} - t_{\\alpha/2, \\nu} \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}}  \\mu  \\bar{X} + t_{\\alpha/2, \\nu} \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}}\n$$\nThe confidence interval is therefore given by $\\bar{x} \\pm E$, where $E$ is the margin of error. The margin of error is defined as:\n$$\nE = t_{\\alpha/2, \\nu} \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given values:\nSample size $n=12$.\nSample standard deviation $s=1.9$.\nDegrees of freedom $\\nu = n-1 = 12-1 = 11$.\nSignificance level $\\alpha = 0.05$, so $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$.\n\nWe need the critical value $t_{0.025, 11}$ from the Student's $t$-distribution with $11$ degrees of freedom. This value is the point such that the area in the upper tail is $0.025$. Consulting a $t$-distribution table or using statistical software, we find:\n$$\nt_{0.025, 11} \\approx 2.201\n$$\nNext, we calculate the standard error of the mean (SEM):\n$$\n\\text{SEM} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{1.9}{\\sqrt{12}}\n$$\nThe margin of error is then:\n$$\nE = t_{0.025, 11} \\cdot \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} \\approx 2.201 \\times \\frac{1.9}{\\sqrt{12}}\n$$\n$$\nE \\approx 2.201 \\times \\frac{1.9}{3.46410} \\approx 2.201 \\times 0.54856 \\approx 1.20736\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the margin of error is $1.207$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for an explanation of how and why the degrees of freedom ($df = n-1$) affect the interval's width. The width of the confidence interval is $2E = 2 \\cdot t_{\\alpha/2, n-1} \\cdot \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}$. The degrees of freedom, $\\nu = n-1$, influence the width primarily through the critical value $t_{\\alpha/2, \\nu}$.\n\nFrom first principles, the Student's $t$-distribution is used instead of the Normal distribution to account for the additional uncertainty introduced by estimating the unknown population standard deviation $\\sigma$ with the sample standard deviation $s$. The shape of the $t$-distribution depends on the degrees of freedom, $\\nu$. For small values of $\\nu$ (i.e., small sample sizes), the $t$-distribution has heavier tails compared to the standard normal distribution. This means there is more probability in the tails, reflecting the greater uncertainty in the estimate $s$.\n\nAs the degrees of freedom $\\nu=n-1$ increase, the sample standard deviation $s$ becomes a more reliable estimate of $\\sigma$. Consequently, the $t$-distribution converges in shape to the standard normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. For a fixed confidence level $1-\\alpha$, the critical value $t_{\\alpha/2, \\nu}$ is a strictly decreasing function of $\\nu$. A larger $\\nu$ corresponds to a smaller critical value $t_{\\alpha/2, \\nu}$, which moves closer to the corresponding $z_{\\alpha/2}$ value from the normal distribution.\nA smaller critical value directly results in a smaller margin of error $E$, and thus a narrower confidence interval. In summary, increasing the degrees of freedom reduces the penalty for estimating $\\sigma$, leading to a smaller critical value and a more precise (narrower) confidence interval for the mean $\\mu$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.207}$$", "id": "4918389"}, {"introduction": "We now advance from estimating a single parameter to a core activity in epidemiology: comparing outcomes between two groups in a clinical trial.

The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, based on standard biostatistical methods for analyzing case-control studies.\n\n**Step 1: Problem Validation**\n\nThe givens are:\n-   Population parameter of interest: Odds Ratio, $\\mathrm{OR}$.\n-   Point estimate of the odds ratio: $\\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}} = 2.5$.\n-   Standard error of the natural logarithm of the estimated odds ratio: $\\mathrm{SE}(\\log \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}) = 0.3$.\n-   Confidence level: $95\\%$.\n-   Theoretical basis: Large-sample normal approximation for the distribution of $\\log \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}$.\n\nThe problem is valid as it is self-contained, scientifically grounded in the theory of maximum likelihood estimation for logistic regression, and objective. It represents a standard procedure in biostatistics.\n\n**Step 2: Construct the 95% Confidence Interval for $\\log(\\mathrm{OR})$**\n\nThe problem states that $\\log \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}$ follows an approximate Normal distribution. The general form for a two-sided confidence interval for a parameter $\\theta$ based on a normally distributed estimator $\\hat{\\theta}$ is:\n$$ \\hat{\\theta} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\theta}) $$\nHere, the parameter is $\\theta = \\log(\\mathrm{OR})$, and the estimator is $\\hat{\\theta} = \\log \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}$. The confidence level is $95\\%$, so the significance level is $\\alpha = 0.05$. The critical value from the standard Normal distribution is $z_{\\alpha/2} = z_{0.025}$. The standard value for $z_{0.025}$ is approximately $1.96$.\n\nThe point estimate for $\\log(\\mathrm{OR})$ is $\\log(\\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}) = \\log(2.5)$.\nThe given standard error is $\\mathrm{SE}(\\log \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}) = 0.3$.\n\nThe $95\\%$ CI for $\\log(\\mathrm{OR})$ is therefore:\n$$ \\log(2.5) \\pm 1.96 \\cdot (0.3) $$\n$$ \\log(2.5) \\pm 0.588 $$\n\nLet $W = 1.96 \\cdot \\mathrm{SE}(\\log \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}) = 0.588$. The interval for $\\log(\\mathrm{OR})$ is $[\\log \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}} - W, \\log \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}} + W]$. This interval is, by construction, symmetric around the point estimate $\\log \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}$ on the logarithmic scale. The width of the interval on either side of the point estimate is $W$.\n\n**Step 3: Transform to the Confidence Interval for $\\mathrm{OR}$**\n\nTo obtain the confidence interval for the odds ratio $\\mathrm{OR}$, we must transform the endpoints of the interval for $\\log(\\mathrm{OR})$ back to the original scale. The inverse function of the natural logarithm, $f(x) = \\ln(x)$, is the exponential function, $g(y) = \\exp(y)$. Since the exponential function is a strictly increasing (monotone) function, we can apply it to the endpoints of the inequality defining the confidence interval:\n$$ \\log \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}} - W \\leq \\log(\\mathrm{OR}) \\leq \\log \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}} + W $$\n$$ \\exp(\\log \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}} - W) \\leq \\mathrm{OR} \\leq \\exp(\\log \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}} + W) $$\n\nUsing the properties of the exponential function, we can rewrite the endpoints:\nLower endpoint: $\\mathrm{CI}_{\\text{lower}} = \\exp(\\log \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}) \\cdot \\exp(-W) = \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}} \\cdot \\exp(-W)$.\nUpper endpoint: $\\mathrm{CI}_{\\text{upper}} = \\exp(\\log \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}) \\cdot \\exp(W) = \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}} \\cdot \\exp(W)$.\n\nThe $95\\%$ CI for $\\mathrm{OR}$ is $[\\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}} \\cdot \\exp(-W), \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}} \\cdot \\exp(W)]$.\n\n**Step 4: Explain the Asymmetry of the Confidence Interval for $\\mathrm{OR}$**\n\nThe CI for $\\log(\\mathrm{OR})$ is symmetric on an additive scale: the endpoints are $\\log \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}} \\pm W$. When we exponentiate, this additive symmetry is transformed into a multiplicative symmetry on the OR scale. The endpoints are $\\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}} \\cdot \\exp(\\pm W)$, which can be written as $[\\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}} / \\exp(W), \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}} \\cdot \\exp(W)]$. The point estimate $\\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}$ is the geometric mean of the endpoints, not the arithmetic mean: $\\sqrt{(\\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}/\\exp(W)) \\cdot (\\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}} \\cdot \\exp(W))} = \\sqrt{\\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}^2} = \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}$.\n\nThe asymmetry in the standard sense (i.e., with respect to arithmetic differences) arises from the non-linear nature of the exponential function. The exponential function is strictly convex, meaning its slope is always increasing. This can be seen from its second derivative, $\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\\exp(x) = \\exp(x)$, which is always positive.\n\nFor any convex function $g(x)$ and any interval $[c-w, c+w]$ with $w0$, the Mean Value Theorem dictates:\n-   $g(c+w) - g(c) = g'(\\xi_1) \\cdot w$ for some $\\xi_1 \\in (c, c+w)$.\n-   $g(c) - g(c-w) = g'(\\xi_2) \\cdot w$ for some $\\xi_2 \\in (c-w, c)$.\n\nSince $g'(x)$ is strictly increasing for a strictly convex function, and $\\xi_1  c  \\xi_2$, we have $g'(\\xi_1)  g'(\\xi_2)$. Consequently, $g(c+w) - g(c)  g(c) - g(c-w)$.\n\nIn our context, $g(x) = \\exp(x)$, $c=\\log\\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}$, and $w=W=0.588$.\nThe distance from the point estimate $\\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}$ to the upper endpoint is:\n$\\mathrm{CI}_{\\text{upper}} - \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}} = \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}} \\cdot \\exp(W) - \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}} = \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}(\\exp(W) - 1)$.\nThe distance from the lower endpoint to the point estimate is:\n$\\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}} - \\mathrm{CI}_{\\text{lower}} = \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}} - \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}} \\cdot \\exp(-W) = \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}(1 - \\exp(-W))$.\n\nSince $W  0$, $\\exp(W)  1$ and $0  \\exp(-W)  1$. The inequality $\\exp(W) - 1  1 - \\exp(-W)$ holds for all $W0$, because it is equivalent to $\\exp(W) + \\exp(-W)  2$, which is a known property of the exponential function (or, equivalently, $\\cosh(W)  1$ for $W \\neq 0$). Thus, the upper part of the confidence interval is longer than the lower part, making the interval asymmetric around the point estimate $\\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}$.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the Ratio of the Upper to the Lower Endpoints**\n\nThe final task is to compute the ratio of the upper endpoint to the lower endpoint of the $95\\%$ CI for $\\mathrm{OR}$.\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\mathrm{CI}_{\\text{upper}}}{\\mathrm{CI}_{\\text{lower}}} = \\frac{\\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}} \\cdot \\exp(W)}{\\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}} \\cdot \\exp(-W)} $$\nThe point estimate $\\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}$ cancels out:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\exp(W)}{\\exp(-W)} = \\exp(W - (-W)) = \\exp(2W) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $W$:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\exp(2 \\cdot z_{\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\mathrm{SE}(\\log \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}})) $$\nThis ratio, often called the \"width\" of the CI on a multiplicative scale, is independent of the point estimate $\\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}$.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\exp(2 \\cdot 1.96 \\cdot 0.3) $$\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\exp(1.176) $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} \\approx 3.2412800... $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required by the problem statement, we get $3.241$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.241}$$", "id": "4918319"}]}
