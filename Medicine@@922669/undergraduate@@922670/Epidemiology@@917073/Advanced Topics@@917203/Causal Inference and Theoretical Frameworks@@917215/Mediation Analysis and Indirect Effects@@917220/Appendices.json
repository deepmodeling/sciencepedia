A baseline categorical covariate $C$ takes three levels $c_1$, $c_2$, and $c_3$. Suppose investigators aim to identify the Natural Indirect Effect (NIE) of $A$ on $Y$ through $M$ using the potential outcomes framework, where $Y(a,m)$ denotes the outcome that would be observed under exposure $A=a$ and mediator set to $M=m$, and $M(a)$ denotes the mediator that would be observed under exposure $A=a$. Investigators are willing to assume consistency, and exchangeability (no unmeasured confounding) of the relations $A \\rightarrow M$, $A \\rightarrow Y$, and $M \\rightarrow Y$ conditional on $C$, but they must evaluate positivity and support conditions.\n\nPositivity for the exposure requires that, for any covariate stratum $c$ with $P(C=c)>0$, both $P(A=1 \\mid C=c)>0$ and $P(A=0 \\mid C=c)>0$. For mediation with natural effects, a cross-world support condition is additionally needed: for any $c$ with $P(C=c)>0$ and any mediator level $m$ such that $P(M=m \\mid A=a, C=c)>0$ for some $a \\in \\{0,1\\}$, we must also have $P(M=m \\mid A=1-a, C=c)>0$; that is, the support of $M$ must overlap across exposure levels within strata of $C$.\n\nEmpirical support in this study is summarized by counts. Within each stratum of $C$, the following counts are observed:\n- For $C=c_1$: under $A=1$, there are $40$ with $M=1$ and $10$ with $M=0$; under $A=0$, there are $0$ with $M=1$ and $50$ with $M=0$.\n- For $C=c_2$: under $A=1$, there are $25$ with $M=1$ and $25$ with $M=0$; under $A=0$, there are $20$ with $M=1$ and $30$ with $M=0$.\n- For $C=c_3$: under $A=1$, there are $0$ observations; under $A=0$, there are $60$ with $M=1$ and $40$ with $M=0$.\n\nAssume that $P(C=c_j)>0$ for $j \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$, and that these empirical patterns reflect the underlying support (i.e., zero counts indicate zero probability).

Extract Givens:**\n- **Variables**: Exposure $A \\in \\{0,1\\}$, Outcome $Y \\in \\{0,1\\}$, Mediator $M \\in \\{0,1\\}$, Covariate $C \\in \\{c_1, c_2, c_3\\}$.\n- **Objective**: Identify the Natural Indirect Effect (NIE) of $A$ on $Y$ through $M$.\n- **Framework**: Potential outcomes $Y(a,m)$ and $M(a)$.\n- **Assumptions**:\n    1. Consistency: $Y = Y(A,M)$, $M = M(A)$.\n    2. Exchangeability: Conditional on $C$, there is no unmeasured confounding for the $A \\rightarrow Y$, $A \\rightarrow M$, and $M \\rightarrow Y$ relationships.\n- **Identifiability Conditions to Evaluate**:\n    1. **Exposure Positivity**: For any covariate stratum $c$ with $P(C=c)>0$, it must hold that $P(A=1 \\mid C=c)>0$ and $P(A=0 \\mid C=c)>0$.\n    2. **Mediator Support**: For any $c$ with $P(C=c)>0$ and any mediator level $m$ such that $P(M=m \\mid A=a, C=c)>0$ for some $a \\in \\{0,1\\}$, we must also have $P(M=m \\mid A=1-a, C=c)>0$. This is equivalent to requiring the support of the mediator's distribution to be the same across exposure levels within each covariate stratum: $\\text{supp}(M \\mid A=1, C=c) = \\text{supp}(M \\mid A=0, C=c)$.\n- **Data (Empirical Counts)**:\n    - For $C=c_1$:\n        - $A=1$: $40$ subjects with $M=1$, $10$ subjects with $M=0$.\n        - $A=0$: $0$ subjects with $M=1$, $50$ subjects with $M=0$.\n    - For $C=c_2$:\n        - $A=1$: $25$ subjects with $M=1$, $25$ subjects with $M=0$.\n        - $A=0$: $20$ subjects with $M=1$, $30$ subjects with $M=0$.\n    - For $C=c_3$:\n        - $A=1$: $0$ subjects.\n        - $A=0$: $60$ subjects with $M=1$, $40$ subjects with $M=0$.\n- **Interpretive Guide**:\n    1. $P(C=c_j)>0$ for $j \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$.\n    2. Zero counts in the data imply zero probability in the underlying distribution.\n    3. No parametric model extrapolation is allowed.\n\n**1.2. Validate Using Extracted Givens:**\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is situated in the field of causal inference, specifically mediation analysis, using the potential outcomes framework. The concepts of Natural Indirect Effect (NIE), consistency, exchangeability, positivity, and mediator support are standard and rigorously defined in this domain. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides precise definitions for the conditions to be checked (positivity and mediator support) and the data to check them against. The question is specific about what needs to be determined (identifiability of the NIE). It is self-contained and a unique conclusion can be derived.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is formal and mathematical, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**1.3. Verdict and Action:**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-posed problem in epidemiology/causal inference. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe Natural Indirect Effect (NIE) is defined as $NIE = E[Y(1, M(1))] - E[Y(1, M(0))]$. Under the stated assumptions of consistency and conditional exchangeability, this quantity is identified from observable data via the mediation formula. For the NIE to be non-parametrically identified, specific positivity and support conditions must hold. We will examine these conditions for each stratum of the covariate $C$. The problem states that zero counts imply zero probability.\n\n**Analysis of Stratum $C=c_1$:**\n1.  **Exposure Positivity**:\n    - The number of subjects with $A=1$ is $40+10=50$. The number with $A=0$ is $0+50=50$.\n    - Since both groups are non-empty, we can estimate $P(A=1|C=c_1)>0$ and $P(A=0|C=c_1)>0$.\n    - **Conclusion**: Exposure positivity holds for $C=c_1$.\n\n2.  **Mediator Support**:\n    - For subjects with $A=1$ and $C=c_1$, there are counts for both $M=1$ ($40$) and $M=0$ ($10$). Thus, the support of the mediator is $\\text{supp}(M \\mid A=1, C=c_1) = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n    - For subjects with $A=0$ and $C=c_1$, there are $0$ counts for $M=1$ and $50$ for $M=0$. Thus, based on the problem's assumption, $\\text{supp}(M \\mid A=0, C=c_1) = \\{0\\}$.\n    - The support sets are not equal: $\\{0, 1\\} \\neq \\{0\\}$.\n    - Let's check the provided definition: Consider $m=1$. We have $P(M=1 \\mid A=1, C=c_1) > 0$. The condition requires that we must also have $P(M=1 \\mid A=0, C=c_1) > 0$. However, the data shows this probability is $0$.\n    - **Conclusion**: The mediator support condition is violated for $C=c_1$. Therefore, the NIE is not identifiable in the subpopulation where $C=c_1$.\n\n**Analysis of Stratum $C=c_2$:**\n1.  **Exposure Positivity**:\n    - The number of subjects with $A=1$ is $25+25=50$. The number with $A=0$ is $20+30=50$.\n    - Both groups are non-empty, so $P(A=1|C=c_2)>0$ and $P(A=0|C=c_2)>0$.\n    - **Conclusion**: Exposure positivity holds for $C=c_2$.\n\n2.  **Mediator Support**:\n    - For $A=1$ and $C=c_2$: subjects exist for $M=1$ ($25$) and $M=0$ ($25$). So, $\\text{supp}(M \\mid A=1, C=c_2) = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n    - For $A=0$ and $C=c_2$: subjects exist for $M=1$ ($20$) and $M=0$ ($30$). So, $\\text{supp}(M \\mid A=0, C=c_2) = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n    - The support sets are equal: $\\{0, 1\\} = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n    - **Conclusion**: The mediator support condition holds for $C=c_2$. Since both exposure positivity and mediator support hold, the NIE is identifiable in the subpopulation defined by $C=c_2$.\n\n**Analysis of Stratum $C=c_3$:**\n1.  **Exposure Positivity**:\n    - The number of subjects with $A=1$ is $0$. The number with $A=0$ is $60+40=100$.\n    - Since there are no subjects with $A=1$ in this stratum, $P(A=1 \\mid C=c_3) = 0$.\n    - **Conclusion**: The exposure positivity condition is violated for $C=c_3$. This alone is sufficient to render the NIE unidentifiable in this stratum and, consequently, for the full population.\n\n**Summary of Identifiability by Stratum**:\n- $C=c_1$: Not identifiable (mediator support fails).\n- $C=c_2$: Identifiable.\n- $C=c_3$: Not identifiable (exposure positivity fails).\n\n### Step 3: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nBased on the above analysis, I will evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Positivity holds for both $A$ and $M$ in all $C$ strata, so the Natural Indirect Effect for the full population is identifiable without model extrapolation.**\n- This statement claims positivity holds everywhere. My analysis shows this is false. Exposure positivity fails in $C=c_3$, and mediator support fails in $C=c_1$. Consequently, the NIE is not identifiable for the full population.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Positivity for $A$ fails in $C=c_3$, breaking identification for the full population; restricting to $C \\in \\{c_1,c_2\\}$ still fails mediator support due to $C=c_1$, so the Natural Indirect Effect is not identifiable even after that restriction.**\n- \"Positivity for $A$ fails in $C=c_3$\": This is correct, as $P(A=1|C=c_3)=0$.\n- \"...breaking identification for the full population\": This is a correct consequence. To identify the population-averaged effect, identifiability must hold in all strata (with $P(C=c)>0$).\n- \"...restricting to $C \\in \\{c_1,c_2\\}$ still fails mediator support due to $C=c_1$\": To identify the NIE in the subpopulation where $C \\in \\{c_1,c_2\\}$, one would need to calculate a weighted average of the stratum-specific effects. As identifiability fails in the $C=c_1$ stratum due to the mediator support violation, the effect for the combined $\\{c_1, c_2\\}$ subpopulation is also not identifiable. This part of the statement is correct.\n- \"...so the Natural Indirect Effect is not identifiable even after that restriction\": This is the correct final conclusion based on the preceding correct premises. Every part of this statement is correct.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Although exposure positivity fails in $C=c_3$, the Natural Indirect Effect remains identifiable for the full population because mediator support holds everywhere.**\n- \"Although exposure positivity fails in $C=c_3$\": This part is correct.\n- \"...the Natural Indirect Effect remains identifiable for the full population...\": This is false. The failure in $C=c_3$ breaks identification for the full population.\n- \"...because mediator support holds everywhere.\": This is also false. Mediator support fails in $C=c_1$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The Natural Indirect Effect is identifiable in the subpopulation with $C=c_2$ because both exposure and mediator positivity hold there; it is not identifiable in $C=c_1$ or $C=c_3$.**\n- \"The Natural Indirect Effect is identifiable in the subpopulation with $C=c_2$ because both exposure and mediator positivity hold there\": My analysis confirms that in stratum $C=c_2$, both exposure positivity and the mediator support condition are met. Therefore, the NIE is identifiable for this specific subpopulation. This statement is correct.\n- \"...it is not identifiable in $C=c_1$ or $C=c_3$\": My analysis shows the NIE is not identifiable in $C=c_1$ (due to mediator support failure) and not identifiable in $C=c_3$ (due to exposure positivity failure). This statement is also correct.\n- The entire statement is composed of correct conclusions from the analysis.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\nBoth statements B and D are correct descriptions of the situation. Statement B describes the consequences for larger populations (full population and a restricted one), while statement D provides a stratum-by-stratum identifiability status.

It is a well-defined and scientifically sound problem in quantitative epidemiology. A complete, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to derive and compute the Natural Indirect Effect (NIE) of an increase in exposure $X$ from a baseline level $x$ to a new level $x'$. The derivation will be based on the potential outcomes framework as required.\n\nLet $Y_{x,m}$ be the potential outcome for $Y$ had the exposure been set to level $x$ and the mediator to level $m$. Let $M_{x}$ be the potential value of the mediator had the exposure been set to level $x$. The causal assumptions of consistency, no interference, and sequential ignorability are assumed to hold.\n\nThe standard definition of the Natural Indirect Effect (NIE), as presented in the main article, is the effect of changing the mediator from the level it would naturally take under the baseline exposure, $M_x$, to the level it would take under the new exposure, $M_{x'}$, while holding the exposure $X$ itself fixed at the new (or treated) level $x'$. The formal definition is the expectation of the difference in potential outcomes:\n$$NIE = E[Y_{x', M_{x'}} - Y_{x', M_{x}}]$$\nThe expectation $E[\\cdot]$ is taken over the distribution of all other variables in the system, namely the confounder $Z$ and the unmeasured error terms $\\varepsilon_M$ and $\\varepsilon_Y$. This represents the average effect in the study population.\n\nUnder the assumption of consistency, we can link the potential outcomes to the observed data models. The model for $Y$ is given as:\n$$Y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} X + \\beta_{2} M + \\beta_{3} X M + \\beta_{4} Z + \\varepsilon_{Y}$$\nTherefore, the potential outcome $Y_{x,m}$ can be written as:\n$$Y_{x,m} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x + \\beta_{2} m + \\beta_{3} x m + \\beta_{4} Z + \\varepsilon_{Y}$$\n\nUsing this expression, we can write the two terms inside the NIE expectation:\n1.  $Y_{x', M_{x'}}$: Here, both the exposure and the mediator are at their levels corresponding to the new exposure $x'$.\n    $$Y_{x', M_{x'}} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x' + \\beta_{2} M_{x'} + \\beta_{3} x' M_{x'} + \\beta_{4} Z + \\varepsilon_{Y}$$\n2.  $Y_{x', M_{x}}$: Here, the exposure is fixed at the new level $x'$, but the mediator is at the level it would have been under the baseline exposure $x$, $M_{x}$.\n    $$Y_{x', M_{x}} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x' + \\beta_{2} M_{x} + \\beta_{3} x' M_{x} + \\beta_{4} Z + \\varepsilon_{Y}$$\n\nThe difference between these two potential outcomes is:\n$$Y_{x', M_{x'}} - Y_{x', M_{x}} = (\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x' + \\beta_{2} M_{x'} + \\beta_{3} x' M_{x'} + \\beta_{4} Z + \\varepsilon_{Y}) - (\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x' + \\beta_{2} M_{x} + \\beta_{3} x' M_{x} + \\beta_{4} Z + \\varepsilon_{Y})$$\n$$Y_{x', M_{x'}} - Y_{x', M_{x}} = \\beta_{2} M_{x'} + \\beta_{3} x' M_{x'} - \\beta_{2} M_{x} - \\beta_{3} x' M_{x}$$\nFactoring terms, we get:\n$$Y_{x', M_{x'}} - Y_{x', M_{x}} = (\\beta_{2} + \\beta_{3} x') (M_{x'} - M_{x})$$\n\nNext, we must find an expression for the difference in the potential mediator values, $M_{x'} - M_{x}$. We use the given model for the mediator $M$:\n$$M = \\alpha_{0} + \\alpha_{1} X + \\alpha_{2} Z + \\varepsilon_{M}$$\nBy consistency, the potential mediator value $M_x$ is:\n$$M_x = \\alpha_{0} + \\alpha_{1} x + \\alpha_{2} Z + \\varepsilon_{M}$$\nSimilarly, for $M_{x'}$:\n$$M_{x'} = \\alpha_{0} + \\alpha_{1} x' + \\alpha_{2} Z + \\varepsilon_{M}$$\nThe difference is:\n$$M_{x'} - M_{x} = (\\alpha_{0} + \\alpha_{1} x' + \\alpha_{2} Z + \\varepsilon_{M}) - (\\alpha_{0} + \\alpha_{1} x + \\alpha_{2} Z + \\varepsilon_{M})$$\n$$M_{x'} - M_{x} = \\alpha_{1} x' - \\alpha_{1} x = \\alpha_{1} (x' - x)$$\nNote that in this linear model setup, the difference in the potential mediator values is a constant that does not depend on the confounder $Z$ or the error term $\\varepsilon_M$.\n\nNow we substitute this result back into the expression for the difference in potential outcomes:\n$$Y_{x', M_{x'}} - Y_{x', M_{x}} = (\\beta_{2} + \\beta_{3} x') [\\alpha_{1} (x' - x)]$$\nTo find the NIE, we take the expectation of this quantity. Since the expression on the right-hand side is a constant composed of model parameters and fixed exposure levels, its expectation is simply the expression itself.\n$$NIE = E[ (\\beta_{2} + \\beta_{3} x') \\alpha_{1} (x' - x) ] = (\\beta_{2} + \\beta_{3} x') \\alpha_{1} (x' - x)$$\nThis is the derived analytical expression for the Natural Indirect Effect under the specified models. The effect is evaluated at the new exposure level $x'$ due to the interaction term $\\beta_3 X M$. Because the expression for $NIE$ does not depend on $Z$, the conditional NIE given any value of $Z$ is the same as the marginal (population-averaged) NIE.\n\n### Calculation\nWe are given the following values:\n-   $\\alpha_{1} = 0.04$\n-   $\\beta_{2} = 0.60$\n-   $\\beta_{3} = -0.01$\n-   $x = 12$\n-   $x' = 17$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula for NIE:\n$$NIE = (0.60 + (-0.01) \\times 17) \\times 0.04 \\times (17 - 12)$$\n$$NIE = (0.60 - 0.17) \\times 0.04 \\times 5$$\n$$NIE = (0.43) \\times (0.20)$$\n$$NIE = 0.086$$\nThe problem requests the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$NIE = 0.0860$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0860}$$", "id": "4611445"}, {"introduction": "In observational research, the assumption of no unmeasured confounding is often the most tenuous.

The simplified models are:\n$$\nM = \\alpha_{X} X + \\gamma_{C} C + \\varepsilon_{M}\n$$\n$$\nY = \\beta_{X} X + \\beta_{M} M + \\delta_{C} C + \\varepsilon_{Y}\n$$\nIn this linear, additive system, the Natural Indirect Effect (NIE) on the mean difference scale is the product of the coefficient for the effect of the exposure $X$ on the mediator $M$ ($\\alpha_X$), and the coefficient for the effect of the mediator $M$ on the outcome $Y$ conditional on exposure $X$ ($\\beta_M$).\n$$\n\\text{NIE} = \\alpha_X \\beta_M\n$$\nThe exposure $X$ is randomized, making it independent of the pre-exposure confounder $C$ and the error terms $\\varepsilon_M$ and $\\varepsilon_Y$. Consequently, the coefficient $\\alpha_X$ can be estimated without bias by regressing $M$ on $X$. The problem provides this value as $\\alpha_X = 0.75$.\n\nThe coefficient $\\beta_M$ represents the effect of the mediator $M$ on the outcome $Y$, holding $X$ constant. However, the common cause $C$ is unmeasured. A regression of $Y$ on $X$ and $M$ that omits $C$ will yield a biased estimate of $\\beta_M$. The problem provides this biased estimate as $\\widehat{\\beta}_{M} = 1.44$. Our goal is to derive the true value $\\beta_M$ from the observed $\\widehat{\\beta}_M$ and the given sensitivity parameters.\n\nWe can derive the relationship between $\\widehat{\\beta}_M$ and $\\beta_M$ using the theory of omitted variable bias. In a multiple regression of $Y$ on $X$ and $M$, the coefficient for $M$ is given by:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\beta}_M = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(Y, M_{\\perp X})}{\\operatorname{Var}(M_{\\perp X})}\n$$\nwhere $M_{\\perp X}$ is the residual from a regression of $M$ on $X$.\n\nFirst, let's characterize the residual $M_{\\perp X}$. Based on the structural model for $M$ and the independence of $X$ from $C$ and $\\varepsilon_M$, the linear projection of $M$ onto $X$ is $L(M|X) = \\alpha_X X$. The residual is:\n$$\nM_{\\perp X} = M - L(M|X) = (\\alpha_X X + \\gamma_C C + \\varepsilon_M) - \\alpha_X X = \\gamma_C C + \\varepsilon_M\n$$\nThe denominator $\\operatorname{Var}(M_{\\perp X})$ is the residual variance of $M$ after adjusting for $X$, which is explicitly given as $\\operatorname{Var}(M \\mid X) = 2.00$. Let us verify this from the model structure. Assuming $C$ and $\\varepsilon_M$ are uncorrelated:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(M_{\\perp X}) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\gamma_C C + \\varepsilon_M) = \\gamma_C^2 \\operatorname{Var}(C) + \\operatorname{Var}(\\varepsilon_M)\n$$\nThe problem states $\\operatorname{Var}(M \\mid X)=2.00$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the numerator, $\\operatorname{Cov}(Y, M_{\\perp X})$. We substitute the structural equation for $Y$:\n$$\nY = \\beta_X X + \\beta_M M + \\delta_C C + \\varepsilon_Y\n$$\nTo express the covariance in terms of orthogonal components, we substitute $M = \\alpha_X X + M_{\\perp X}$:\n$$\nY = \\beta_X X + \\beta_M (\\alpha_X X + M_{\\perp X}) + \\delta_C C + \\varepsilon_Y = (\\beta_X + \\beta_M \\alpha_X) X + \\beta_M M_{\\perp X} + \\delta_C C + \\varepsilon_Y\n$$\nNow we compute the covariance:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(Y, M_{\\perp X}) = \\operatorname{Cov}((\\beta_X + \\beta_M \\alpha_X) X + \\beta_M M_{\\perp X} + \\delta_C C + \\varepsilon_Y, M_{\\perp X})\n$$\nUsing the linearity of covariance and the fact that $X$ is uncorrelated with $M_{\\perp X}$ (by construction of residuals):\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(Y, M_{\\perp X}) = (\\beta_X + \\beta_M \\alpha_X)\\operatorname{Cov}(X, M_{\\perp X}) + \\beta_M\\operatorname{Var}(M_{\\perp X}) + \\delta_C\\operatorname{Cov}(C, M_{\\perp X}) + \\operatorname{Cov}(\\varepsilon_Y, M_{\\perp X})\n$$\nThe first term is zero because $\\operatorname{Cov}(X, M_{\\perp X}) = 0$. For the last term, $M_{\\perp X} = \\gamma_C C + \\varepsilon_M$. We assume $\\varepsilon_Y$ is uncorrelated with both $C$ (as $C$ is a specified common cause) and $\\varepsilon_M$ (no other sources of M-Y confounding are mentioned). Thus, $\\operatorname{Cov}(\\varepsilon_Y, M_{\\perp X}) = 0$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(Y, M_{\\perp X}) = \\beta_M\\operatorname{Var}(M_{\\perp X}) + \\delta_C\\operatorname{Cov}(C, M_{\\perp X})\n$$\nWe need to find $\\operatorname{Cov}(C, M_{\\perp X})$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(C, M_{\\perp X}) = \\operatorname{Cov}(C, \\gamma_C C + \\varepsilon_M) = \\gamma_C \\operatorname{Var}(C) + \\operatorname{Cov}(C, \\varepsilon_M)\n$$\nBy construction of the structural model, the error term $\\varepsilon_M$ is uncorrelated with the predictors, so $\\operatorname{Cov}(C, \\varepsilon_M) = 0$. We are given that $C$ is standardized, so $\\operatorname{Var}(C)=1$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(C, M_{\\perp X}) = \\gamma_C \\operatorname{Var}(C) = \\gamma_C\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(Y, M_{\\perp X}) = \\beta_M\\operatorname{Var}(M_{\\perp X}) + \\delta_C \\gamma_C\n$$\nNow we can write the full expression for the biased coefficient $\\widehat{\\beta}_M$:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\beta}_M = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(Y, M_{\\perp X})}{\\operatorname{Var}(M_{\\perp X})} = \\frac{\\beta_M\\operatorname{Var}(M_{\\perp X}) + \\delta_C \\gamma_C}{\\operatorname{Var}(M_{\\perp X})} = \\beta_M + \\frac{\\delta_C \\gamma_C}{\\operatorname{Var}(M_{\\perp X})}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{\\delta_C \\gamma_C}{\\operatorname{Var}(M_{\\perp X})}$ is the bias in $\\widehat{\\beta}_M$ due to omitting the confounder $C$. Recalling that $\\operatorname{Var}(M_{\\perp X}) = \\operatorname{Var}(M \\mid X)$, We can solve for the true (unbiased) coefficient $\\beta_M$:\n$$\n\\beta_M = \\widehat{\\beta}_M - \\frac{\\delta_C \\gamma_C}{\\operatorname{Var}(M \\mid X)}\n$$\nWe are given the following values:\n- Biased mediator coefficient: $\\widehat{\\beta}_M = 1.44$\n- Sensitivity parameter for C-M path: $\\gamma_C = 0.80$\n- Sensitivity parameter for C-Y path: $\\delta_C = 0.50$\n- Residual variance of mediator: $\\operatorname{Var}(M \\mid X) = 2.00$\n- Variance of confounder: $\\operatorname{Var}(C) = 1$ (This value was used implicitly in the derivation $\\operatorname{Cov}(C, M_{\\perp X}) = \\gamma_C \\operatorname{Var}(C) = \\gamma_C$)\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $\\beta_M$:\n$$\n\\beta_M = 1.44 - \\frac{(0.50)(0.80)}{2.00}\n$$\n$$\n\\beta_M = 1.44 - \\frac{0.40}{2.00}\n$$\n$$\n\\beta_M = 1.44 - 0.20 = 1.24\n$$\nThis is the sensitivity-adjusted coefficient for the mediator-outcome relationship. Now we can compute the sensitivity-adjusted NIE by combining this with the given coefficient for the exposure-mediator path, $\\alpha_X = 0.75$.\n$$\n\\text{NIE}_{\\text{adj}} = \\alpha_X \\beta_M = (0.75)(1.24)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{NIE}_{\\text{adj}} = 0.93\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\text{NIE}_{\\text{adj}} = 0.9300\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9300}$$", "id": "4611426"}]}
