By design, exposure in a prespecified risk window immediately preceding the event time is compared with exposure in referent windows sampled from other times for the same individual within the same calendar stratum. A fundamental requirement for unbiased within-person comparison is that referent windows neither overlap the risk window nor contain the event time, to avoid contamination by the hazard period and to maintain exchangeability conditional on time-invariant factors.\n\nSuppose time is measured continuously in days from the start of a calendar month of length $30$ days, so the month is the interval $[0,30)$. An individual experiences an index event at time $t_0$, where $t_0$ is the start of day $20$, that is, $t_0=19$.

The concepts of risk windows, referent windows, and the exclusion criteria (non-overlap, non-containment of the event) are central to this methodology. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions, data ($t_0, \\delta, s_i$), and explicit rules to arrive at a unique and verifiable solution.

No flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires us to determine which of the four candidate referent windows are valid according to the specified rules. We begin by defining the risk window and formalizing the validity conditions.\n\nThe event occurs at time $t_0 = 19$. The risk window has a width of $\\delta = 3$ days. The risk window is defined as the half-open interval:\n$$\n\\text{Risk Window} = [t_0 - \\delta, t_0) = [19 - 3, 19) = [16, 19)\n$$\n\nA candidate referent window, denoted as $[s_i, s_i + \\delta)$, is considered valid if and only if it satisfies two conditions:\n1.  **Non-overlap with the risk window:** The intersection of the referent window and the risk window must be the empty set.\n    $$\n    [s_i, s_i + \\delta) \\cap [16, 19) = \\emptyset\n    $$\n2.  **Exclusion of the event time:** The event time $t_0$ must not be an element of the referent window.\n    $$\n    t_0 \\notin [s_i, s_i + \\delta) \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 19 \\notin [s_i, s_i + 3)\n    $$\n    This condition is equivalent to requiring that either $19 < s_i$ or $19 \\ge s_i + 3$.\n\nWe will now evaluate each of the four candidate referent windows.\n\n**Candidate 1: $s_1 = 0$**\nThe referent window is $[s_1, s_1 + \\delta) = [0, 0 + 3) = [0, 3)$.\n1.  **Check for overlap:** The interval $[0, 3)$ and the risk window $[16, 19)$ are disjoint, as the maximum value in the first interval ($3$) is less than the minimum value in the second ($16$). Thus, $[0, 3) \\cap [16, 19) = \\emptyset$. Condition 1 is satisfied.\n2.  **Check for event time inclusion:** We check if $19 \\in [0, 3)$. Since $19$ is not between $0$ (inclusive) and $3$ (exclusive), this condition is satisfied.\nSince both conditions are met, **Candidate 1 is a valid referent window**.\n\n**Candidate 2: $s_2 = 5$**\nThe referent window is $[s_2, s_2 + \\delta) = [5, 5 + 3) = [5, 8)$.\n1.  **Check for overlap:** The interval $[5, 8)$ and the risk window $[16, 19)$ are disjoint. The maximum value in the first interval ($8$) is less than the minimum value in the second ($16$). Thus, $[5, 8) \\cap [16, 19) = \\emptyset$. Condition 1 is satisfied.\n2.  **Check for event time inclusion:** We check if $19 \\in [5, 8)$. Since $19$ is not between $5$ (inclusive) and $8$ (exclusive), this condition is satisfied.\nSince both conditions are met, **Candidate 2 is a valid referent window**.\n\n**Candidate 3: $s_3 = 17$**\nThe referent window is $[s_3, s_3 + \\delta) = [17, 17 + 3) = [17, 20)$.\n1.  **Check for overlap:** We evaluate the intersection of $[17, 20)$ and the risk window $[16, 19)$. The intersection is the interval of numbers $x$ such that $\\max(17, 16) \\le x < \\min(20, 19)$. This gives the interval $[17, 19)$. Since the intersection is not the empty set, $[17, 20) \\cap [16, 19) \\neq \\emptyset$, the non-overlap condition is violated.\n2.  **Check for event time inclusion:** We check if $19 \\in [17, 20)$. Since $17 \\le 19 < 20$ is true, the event time $t_0=19$ is contained within this referent window. This condition is also violated.\nSince Candidate 3 fails to meet at least one condition (in this case, both), **Candidate 3 is an invalid referent window**.\n\n**Candidate 4: $s_4 = 26$**\nThe referent window is $[s_4, s_4 + \\delta) = [26, 26 + 3) = [26, 29)$.\n1.  **Check for overlap:** The interval $[26, 29)$ and the risk window $[16, 19)$ are disjoint. The minimum value in the first interval ($26$) is greater than the maximum possible value in the second ($19$). Thus, $[26, 29) \\cap [16, 19) = \\emptyset$. Condition 1 is satisfied.\n2.  **Check for event time inclusion:** We check if $19 \\in [26, 29)$. Since $19$ is not between $26$ (inclusive) and $29$ (exclusive), this condition is satisfied.\nSince both conditions are met, **Candidate 4 is a valid referent window**.\n\nIn summary, the valid referent windows are those corresponding to $s_1=0$, $s_2=5$, and $s_4=26$.

For each individual, define the hazard window as the $k$ days prior to event onset, and the referent window as the same day of the week exactly $2$ weeks earlier.\n\nAcross the $12$ matched pairs, let $a$ denote the number of pairs where both hazard and referent windows are exposed, $b$ where the hazard window is exposed and the referent window is unexposed (discordant in the direction consistent with a positive association), $c$ where the hazard window is unexposed and the referent window is exposed (discordant in the opposite direction), and $d$ where both windows are unexposed.

No units are required, as the odds ratio is dimensionless.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the maximum likelihood estimator for the exposure odds ratio in a self-matched case-crossover design and its application to a given dataset.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\nThe problem is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of epidemiology and biostatistics, specifically the case-crossover design, which is a variant of a matched case-control study. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and definitions for a unique solution. The data are internally consistent, as the sum of counts for each scenario equals the total number of individuals, $12$. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE)\n\nThe case-crossover design with a single referent window for each case (event) is analytically equivalent to a $1$:$1$ matched case-control study. The parameter of interest is the odds ratio ($\\text{OR}$) of the acute event associated with a transient exposure. We denote this odds ratio by $\\theta$.\n\nLet there be $N$ individuals, each forming a matched pair consisting of a 'case' window (the hazard window) and a 'control' window (the referent window). For each individual $i$ (where $i=1, \\dots, N$), let $X_{i1}$ be the binary exposure status ($1$ for exposed, $0$ for unexposed) in the hazard window, and $X_{i0}$ be the exposure status in the referent window.\n\nThe standard model for analyzing matched-pair data is conditional logistic regression. The model assumes the probability of the event depends on an individual-specific baseline risk and the exposure status. The conditional likelihood approach eliminates the individual-specific nuisance parameters by conditioning on the set of exposures observed within each pair.\n\nThe contributions to the conditional likelihood come only from the discordant pairs, where the exposure status differs between the hazard and referent windows. There are two types of discordant pairs:\n1.  Type $b$: Exposed in the hazard window, unexposed in the referent window ($X_{i1}=1, X_{i0}=0$).\n2.  Type $c$: Unexposed in the hazard window, exposed in the referent window ($X_{i1}=0, X_{i0}=1$).\n\nConcordant pairs, where the exposure status is the same in both windows (type $a$: $X_{i1}=1, X_{i0}=1$; type $d$: $X_{i1}=0, X_{i0}=0$), do not contribute to the conditional likelihood for the odds ratio $\\theta$, as their conditional probability is $1$.\n\nLet $\\beta$ be the log-odds ratio, such that $\\theta = \\exp(\\beta)$. For a discordant pair, the conditional probability of the case (hazard window) being the exposed one is given by:\n$$ P(X_{i1}=1 | X_{i1}+X_{i0}=1) = \\frac{\\theta}{1+\\theta} $$\nThis corresponds to a pair of type $b$.\n\nConversely, the conditional probability of the control (referent window) being the exposed one, given a discordant pair, is:\n$$ P(X_{i1}=0 | X_{i1}+X_{i0}=1) = \\frac{1}{1+\\theta} $$\nThis corresponds to a pair of type $c$.\n\nLet $b$ be the total count of discordant pairs of the first type and $c$ be the total count of discordant pairs of the second type across all $N$ individuals. The total number of discordant pairs is $b+c$. The conditional likelihood function, $L_c(\\theta)$, is the product of the probabilities for each of the $b+c$ discordant pairs. This has the form of a binomial likelihood:\n$$ L_c(\\theta) = \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{1+\\theta} \\right)^b \\left( \\frac{1}{1+\\theta} \\right)^c = \\frac{\\theta^b}{(1+\\theta)^{b+c}} $$\n\nTo find the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of $\\theta$, we maximize $L_c(\\theta)$. It is equivalent and simpler to maximize the log-likelihood function, $\\ell_c(\\theta) = \\ln(L_c(\\theta))$:\n$$ \\ell_c(\\theta) = b \\ln(\\theta) - (b+c) \\ln(1+\\theta) $$\n\nWe differentiate $\\ell_c(\\theta)$ with respect to $\\theta$ and set the derivative to zero to find the critical point:\n$$ \\frac{d\\ell_c}{d\\theta} = \\frac{b}{\\theta} - \\frac{b+c}{1+\\theta} $$\nSetting $\\frac{d\\ell_c}{d\\theta} = 0$:\n$$ \\frac{b}{\\theta} = \\frac{b+c}{1+\\theta} $$\n$$ b(1+\\theta) = \\theta(b+c) $$\n$$ b + b\\theta = b\\theta + c\\theta $$\n$$ b = c\\theta $$\nSolving for $\\theta$ gives the MLE, denoted as $\\hat{\\theta}$:\n$$ \\hat{\\theta} = \\frac{b}{c} $$\nThis elegant result shows that the MLE for the odds ratio in a $1$:$1$ matched design is the ratio of the counts of the two types of discordant pairs.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of the Odds Ratio for each Hazard Window\n\nWe now apply this estimator to the data provided for the $N=12$ individuals. The counts $(a, b, c, d)$ are given for three different hazard window definitions ($k=1, 3, 7$ days).\n\n1.  For a hazard window of $k=1$ day:\n    The counts are $(a,b,c,d) = (2,5,3,2)$.\n    Here, $b=5$ and $c=3$.\n    The estimated odds ratio is:\n    $$ \\hat{\\theta}_{k=1} = \\frac{5}{3} \\approx 1.667 $$\n\n2.
