## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the theoretical foundations of the Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), detailing its core principles, assumptions, and estimation procedures. While the [abstract logic](@entry_id:635488) of RDD is powerful, its true value is revealed when applied to tangible, real-world problems. This chapter explores the remarkable versatility of RDD by examining its application across a diverse range of disciplines, from its heartland in public health and [policy evaluation](@entry_id:136637) to the frontiers of environmental science and neuroscience. Our objective is not to reiterate the mechanics of RDD, but to demonstrate how this elegant design is used to answer critical causal questions that would otherwise be intractable.

### From Prediction to Causal Insight

Before delving into specific applications, it is essential to reinforce the fundamental distinction between prediction and causal inference. Many analytical methods in science and finance are designed for **prediction**: their goal is to produce the most accurate forecast of a future outcome given available information. A classic example is a time-series model like an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, which might be used to forecast future asset returns based on past returns. Such models excel at identifying and extrapolating correlations but are silent on the causal mechanisms generating the data. An ARIMA model, no matter how well-fitted to historical data, cannot by itself reveal the causal effect of a new trading regulation, as the policy may fundamentally alter the structure of the market in ways the model cannot anticipate.

In contrast, **causal inference** methods like RDD are designed to estimate the impact of a specific intervention—to answer the "what if" question. RDD achieves this not by modeling complex correlations, but by leveraging a specific feature of the world: a rule that assigns a treatment based on whether an observable continuous variable crosses a threshold. The power of RDD lies in its ability to construct a credible counterfactual, allowing us to attribute the observed jump in an outcome at the threshold to the treatment itself. While an RDD model tailored to a cutoff may not be a good global predictor of the outcome, its strength is in providing a defensible estimate of a local causal effect [@problem_id:2438832]. This chapter showcases how this powerful logic is put into practice.

### Core Applications in Public Health and Epidemiology

RDD is a cornerstone of modern program evaluation in public health, where many interventions are assigned based on clearly defined thresholds.

#### Age-Based Eligibility and Screening Programs

Age is a common and often immutable running variable, making it ideal for RDD analysis. Many preventive health services are recommended or provided to individuals once they reach a certain age. For instance, consider a public health policy that provides free influenza vaccines to all individuals aged 65 years or older. This creates a sharp discontinuity in eligibility at the age of 65. In a **sharp RDD**, where everyone above the threshold is treated (eligible) and everyone below is not, the causal effect of eligibility on an outcome like influenza-related hospitalizations can be estimated by comparing the average hospitalization rates for individuals just above and just below the 65-year-old cutoff. The estimand of interest, the local average treatment effect at the cutoff, $\tau_{RDD} = \mathbb{E}[Y(1) - Y(0) \mid \text{Age} = 65]$, is identified by the difference in the limits of the observed outcome from either side of the threshold: $\tau_{RDD} = \lim_{a \downarrow 65} \mathbb{E}[Y \mid \text{Age} = a] - \lim_{a \uparrow 65} \mathbb{E}[Y \mid \text{Age} = a]$ [@problem_id:4629818].

However, many programs do not feature such perfect adherence. This gives rise to the **fuzzy RDD**. Consider a national cancer screening program that mails an invitation for [colorectal cancer](@entry_id:264919) screening to individuals on their 50th birthday. Not everyone who receives an invitation will get screened, and some individuals below the age of 50 may get screened for other reasons. Here, the treatment of interest is the screening itself, but the cutoff only affects the *probability* of being screened. The RDD estimates the effect of the *invitation* (an "intent-to-treat" analysis), which can then be scaled by the observed jump in the screening rate at the cutoff to recover the causal effect of the screening on the "compliers"—those who get screened only because they were invited. Such a design requires careful specification of the running variable (e.g., age measured in days for precision) and the outcome (e.g., diagnosis of late-stage cancer within a fixed follow-up period) to avoid common epidemiological biases like selection and immortal time bias [@problem_id:4629751].

#### Clinical Guidelines and Risk Score Thresholds

RDD is not limited to formal laws; it is equally powerful for evaluating the effects of widely adopted clinical guidelines. Clinicians often use risk scores or biomarker values to make treatment decisions, creating de facto thresholds.

For example, clinical guidelines may recommend initiating statin therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease if a patient's 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score is at or above a threshold, such as $7.5\%$. Since this is a recommendation, adherence is imperfect, creating a fuzzy RDD. Researchers can estimate the causal effect of statin initiation on the reduction of LDL cholesterol by dividing the observed jump in average LDL-C reduction at the $7.5\%$ risk threshold by the jump in the probability of statin initiation at that same threshold. A key strength of RDD in this context is its robustness to unmeasured confounders. For instance, "unmeasured patient severity" might influence both the risk score and the outcome, but as long as this severity varies smoothly across the $7.5\%$ threshold, its influence is differenced out by the RDD estimator, leaving an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect [@problem_id:4629756].

This logic extends to numerous clinical scenarios. The effect of intensifying diabetes treatment can be estimated by exploiting the guideline to do so when a patient's HbA1c level exceeds $7.0\%$ [@problem_id:4972697]. Similarly, the causal effect of bariatric surgery on diabetes remission can be identified using the Body Mass Index (BMI) eligibility cutoff of $40 \, \text{kg/m}^2$ [@problem_id:4629752]. These clinical applications underscore the critical importance of diagnostic checks. Because clinicians and patients are aware of these thresholds, there is a potential for manipulation of the running variable (e.g., re-measuring a borderline HbA1c or BMI value to qualify for a treatment). Therefore, a credible analysis must include a comprehensive suite of diagnostics, such as testing for a discontinuity in the density of the running variable at the cutoff (e.g., a McCrary test) and checking for balance in pre-treatment patient covariates.

### RDD in Health Policy and Social Sciences

The reach of RDD extends broadly across policy domains, where eligibility for social programs is frequently determined by income or other quantifiable metrics.

#### Income-Based Social Programs and Health

Under the "Health in All Policies" framework, researchers are often interested in how non-health policies affect health outcomes. RDD is an invaluable tool for this purpose. For instance, a prenatal care program might be offered to pregnant individuals whose household income falls below $185\%$ of the Federal Poverty Level. An RDD using income as the running variable can estimate the causal effect of *eligibility* for this program on infant health outcomes like birth weight. This represents a sharp RDD focused on the intent-to-treat effect of the policy [@problem_id:4629771]. Similarly, the effect of a housing voucher program, also determined by an income threshold, on cardiovascular health indicators like systolic blood pressure can be estimated using a fuzzy RDD, which accounts for the fact that not all eligible households will successfully find and use a voucher [@problem_id:4533730].

#### Evaluating National and Global Policies

Some of the most well-known applications of RDD involve the evaluation of large-scale laws and regulations. The effect of the Minimum Legal Drinking Age (MLDA) on outcomes like mortality and morbidity is a canonical example. Using age as the running variable and the 21-year-old cutoff, RDD allows for a credible estimation of the causal impact of legal access to alcohol. The MLDA context serves as a powerful illustration of the full set of assumptions required for a valid RDD: the continuity of potential outcomes, the absence of sorting or manipulation at the threshold, the exclusion restriction (that crossing the age threshold affects outcomes only through access to alcohol), and monotonicity (no individuals purchase alcohol legally only when underage but not when of legal age) [@problem_id:4560412].

RDD's utility is not confined by national borders. In global health and development economics, it can be applied to evaluate policies at the country level. For example, if a bilateral aid agency provides health funding to countries with a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita below a certain threshold, RDD can be used to estimate the causal effect of aid eligibility on national health indicators like immunization coverage. This demonstrates the scalability of the design to macro-level questions [@problem_id:4969036].

### Interdisciplinary Frontiers of RDD

The logic of RDD is remarkably general, finding applications in fields far beyond its origins in economics and public policy.

#### Spatial RDD in Urban Planning and Environmental Science

When a policy is implemented based on a geographical boundary, the running variable can be the spatial distance to that boundary. This **spatial RDD** is a powerful tool in urban planning and [environmental science](@entry_id:187998). For example, a city might create a Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) zone on one side of a specific street, implementing policies to encourage walkability and public transit use. By defining the running variable as the distance to this boundary, researchers can estimate the causal effect of living inside the TOD zone on health behaviors and outcomes, such as resident BMI [@problem_id:4581712].

This spatial design finds a unique application in [soundscape ecology](@entry_id:191534). To study the effect of traffic noise on wildlife, researchers can exploit changes in traffic regulations. A speed limit reduction at a specific sign along a road creates a spatial cutoff. Using distance from the sign as the running variable, a fuzzy RDD can estimate the causal effect of reduced vehicle speed (the treatment) on both ambient noise levels and the vocalization behavior of nearby animals. Alternatively, a regulation like a nighttime curfew on heavy trucks creates a sharp discontinuity in time. A **temporal RDD**, with time of day as the running variable, can estimate the causal impact of the curfew on the acoustic environment and animal activity. In these settings, domain knowledge from physics ([acoustics](@entry_id:265335)) and biology ([animal behavior](@entry_id:140508)) is crucial for justifying the core RDD assumption that potential outcomes are continuous across the cutoff [@problem_id:2533891].

#### RDD in Neuroscience

The applicability of RDD extends even to the experimental sciences. In neuroscience, treatments like Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) are often administered based on crossing a biophysical threshold. During intraoperative mapping, a neuroengineer may identify a patient-specific stimulation amplitude threshold. A software algorithm might then use this threshold to determine whether to deliver active stimulation. Due to safety overrides or clinical adjustments, this assignment is often "fuzzy." An RDD can exploit this setup, using the difference between the commanded amplitude and the threshold as the running variable. This allows for the estimation of the local causal effect of the electrical stimulation on immediate clinical outcomes, such as tremor reduction, providing a rigorous causal interpretation that is difficult to achieve with simple correlational analyses [@problem_id:4150085].

### Advanced RDD Extensions

The basic RDD framework has been extended to accommodate more complex policy environments.

#### Regression Kink Design (RKD)

Some policies do not create a jump in the level of treatment, but rather a change in its *slope*. For example, an insurance cost-sharing schedule might be a continuous function of income, but the rate at which cost-sharing increases with income might change abruptly at a certain income level. This creates a "kink" in the [policy function](@entry_id:136948). The **Regression Kink Design (RKD)** exploits this feature. It estimates the causal effect of the policy variable by calculating the ratio of the change in the slope of the outcome to the change in the slope of the policy at the threshold. RKD requires stronger assumptions than RDD, including the smoothness of the first derivative of the potential outcomes, but allows for the analysis of a different class of important policies [@problem_id:4629780].

#### Difference-in-Regression-Discontinuity (RDiD)

A key threat to RDD validity is the presence of a pre-existing discontinuity at the cutoff, perhaps due to some other policy that uses the same threshold. The **Difference-in-Regression-Discontinuity (RDiD)** design elegantly addresses this problem by combining RDD with a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach. If data are available from both before and after the policy of interest was introduced, one can calculate the discontinuity at the cutoff in the pre-policy period and subtract it from the discontinuity in the post-policy period. This method "differences out" any time-invariant confounding discontinuity at the threshold, isolating the true causal effect of the new policy. For example, if a new vaccination voucher is introduced based on a risk score, RDiD can account for any baseline differences in health outcomes that may have already existed at that risk score cutoff prior to the voucher's introduction [@problem_id:4629781].

### Conclusion

The Regression Discontinuity Design, in its various forms, represents one of the most credible and versatile [quasi-experimental methods](@entry_id:636714) available to researchers. As demonstrated by the applications in this chapter, its utility spans an impressive array of disciplines and questions. The strength of RDD lies in its simple, transparent logic: it leverages the very rules that govern our institutions, policies, and even clinical decisions to create natural experiments. From evaluating the effect of a single pill to the impact of a global aid program, RDD provides a rigorous framework for moving beyond mere correlation to establish credible causal claims. Its successful application, however, always hinges on a deep understanding of the institutional context and a thorough, honest interrogation of its core assumptions.
