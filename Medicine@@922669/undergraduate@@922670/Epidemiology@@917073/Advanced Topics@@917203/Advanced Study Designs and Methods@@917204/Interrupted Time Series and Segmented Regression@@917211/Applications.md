## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the theoretical foundations and statistical mechanics of Interrupted Time Series (ITS) analysis and segmented regression. Having mastered the principles, we now turn to the primary purpose of this methodology: its application in the real world. This chapter explores how ITS serves as a powerful quasi-experimental tool across diverse scientific disciplines, enabling researchers to estimate the causal effects of large-scale interventions in settings where randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are infeasible, unethical, or impractical.

Our exploration is guided by a central theme: the transition from idealized models to the complex, multifactorial realities of observational data. While the core principles of ITS are elegant in their simplicity, its true utility is demonstrated in its capacity to be adapted and refined to provide robust inference amidst confounding factors, co-occurring events, and complex data structures. The fundamental strength of ITS lies in its structured approach to counterfactual reasoning. By using a series of repeated measurements before and after a clearly defined intervention, the analysis formally estimates the impact of that intervention by comparing the post-intervention reality to the projected continuation of the pre-intervention trend. This projected trend serves as the counterfactual—an estimate of what would have happened in the absence of the intervention. We will see this principle applied to evaluate policies and programs in public health, translational medicine, and clinical epidemiology. [@problem_id:5052213]

### The Canonical Model in Public Health Evaluation

The most direct application of ITS is in the evaluation of population-level public health policies. These interventions, such as new laws or statewide health initiatives, are implemented at a specific point in time and affect an entire population, making concurrent control groups impossible to construct. Segmented regression provides the analytical engine for this evaluation.

Consider the canonical segmented regression model for an outcome $Y_t$ measured at time $t$, with an intervention occurring at time $T_0$:
$$
E[Y_t] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + \beta_2 I_t + \beta_3 S_t
$$
Here, $t$ is a continuous variable for time, $I_t$ is an indicator that switches from $0$ to $1$ at $t \ge T_0$, and $S_t$ is a post-intervention time counter, often defined as $(t - T_0)I_t$. The parameters represent four crucial components of the time series:
-   $\beta_0$: The baseline level of the outcome at the start of the series ($t=0$).
-   $\beta_1$: The baseline trend or slope before the intervention.
-   $\beta_2$: The immediate **level change** at the moment of the intervention.
-   $\beta_3$: The **slope change**, representing the difference between the post-intervention trend and the baseline trend.

A concrete application is the evaluation of a statewide naloxone distribution policy aimed at reducing opioid overdose mortality. Public health officials can use monthly overdose mortality rates as the outcome $Y_t$ and fit the model above, with $T_0$ as the month the policy was implemented. In this context, a statistically significant negative value for $\beta_2$ would suggest an immediate drop in mortality attributable to the policy's rollout. A significant negative $\beta_3$ would indicate that the policy initiated a sustained change, causing the mortality rate to decline more steeply (or increase more slowly) than it had before. The total impact of the policy at any future point in time—say, $12$ months post-implementation—is a combination of this initial shock and the subsequent change in trend, captured by the expression $\beta_2 + 12\beta_3$. This ability to disentangle immediate from sustained effects is a key advantage of the ITS design. [@problem_id:4539042]

This fundamental model is versatile and finds application across a wide range of public health questions, such as estimating the impact of cannabis legalization on rates of emergency department visits for cannabis-related issues. In such a study, $Y_t$ would be the monthly visit rate, and the coefficients would reveal whether legalization led to an abrupt increase in visits ($\beta_2 > 0$) and whether it altered the long-term trajectory of such visits ($\beta_3 \ne 0$). [@problem_id:4762996]

### Advanced Applications: Modeling Real-World Complexities

While the basic linear model provides a clear framework, real-world data rarely conform to its simple assumptions. A rigorous ITS analysis must therefore contend with challenges such as non-normal outcomes, [confounding variables](@entry_id:199777), seasonality, and autocorrelation. The flexibility of the segmented regression framework, especially when integrated into Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), allows for these complexities to be addressed systematically.

#### Modeling Count Data and Exposure

Many important outcomes in epidemiology and medicine are not continuous measurements but counts of events, such as the number of infections, suicides, or accidents per month. Such data are discrete, non-negative, and often exhibit a variance greater than their mean (a phenomenon known as overdispersion). For these scenarios, a standard [linear regression](@entry_id:142318) is statistically inappropriate.

For example, to evaluate the effectiveness of installing physical barriers on a high-risk bridge to prevent suicides, the outcome $Y_t$ would be the monthly count of suicide events. The appropriate analytical tool is a GLM, such as a Negative Binomial regression, which is designed for overdispersed [count data](@entry_id:270889). Furthermore, the raw count of events is often less informative than the *rate*. If pedestrian foot traffic ($E_t$) across the bridge varies monthly, an increase in suicide counts could simply reflect an increase in the number of people on the bridge. To account for this, the model must adjust for exposure. In a log-link GLM (e.g., Poisson or Negative Binomial), this is elegantly achieved by including the natural logarithm of the exposure variable, $\ln(E_t)$, as an **offset**. This effectively models the rate of events (suicides per pedestrian-month) rather than the raw count, providing a more meaningful estimate of the intervention's impact. [@problem_id:4580361]

#### Adjusting for Seasonality, Confounders, and Co-interventions

The central assumption of ITS—that the pre-intervention trend accurately represents the counterfactual—is threatened by any external event or pattern that coincides with the intervention and also affects the outcome. Robust ITS analyses must therefore identify and model these factors.

-   **Seasonality:** Many health-related time series exhibit predictable seasonal patterns, such as the increase in respiratory illnesses in winter or dips in activity during major holidays. If not properly modeled, these cyclical patterns can be mistaken for intervention effects. A flexible way to control for seasonality is to include trigonometric **Fourier terms** (e.g., pairs of [sine and cosine functions](@entry_id:172140)) in the regression model, which can capture periodic fluctuations of various frequencies (e.g., 12-month and 6-month cycles). [@problem_id:4624307] [@problem_id:4580361]

-   **Time-Varying Confounders:** Broader secular trends can influence the outcome independently of the intervention. For instance, when evaluating a bridge-specific suicide barrier, it is crucial to adjust for the citywide suicide rate. Including this as a covariate in the model helps to ensure that any observed change is specific to the bridge and not just a reflection of a general decrease in suicides across the city. Similarly, evaluating a hospital-based program requires controlling for changes in patient acuity (e.g., using the case-mix index), which may affect both process and outcome measures. [@problem_id:4580361] [@problem_id:4624307]

-   **Co-interventions and Historical Events:** Sometimes, another distinct intervention is introduced during the study period. In the bridge barrier example, a public signage campaign with a crisis hotline number might be launched several months after the barriers are installed. To isolate the effect of the barriers, this co-intervention must be modeled, typically by including another [indicator variable](@entry_id:204387) that "switches on" at the time of the second intervention. Likewise, major, unexpected events—such as the COVID-19 pandemic—can dramatically alter trends and must be included as covariates to prevent profound confounding of the primary intervention effect. [@problem_id:4580361] [@problem_id:4624307]

#### Addressing Serial Correlation

A final and critical challenge in [time series analysis](@entry_id:141309) is **autocorrelation** (or serial correlation), which is the tendency for the random error associated with one observation to be correlated with the errors of nearby observations. This violates the assumption of [independent errors](@entry_id:275689) that underpins standard regression, leading to incorrectly estimated standard errors and, consequently, unreliable p-values and confidence intervals. A proper ITS analysis must diagnose and correct for this. Diagnosis typically involves examining the autocorrelation function (ACF) and [partial autocorrelation function](@entry_id:143703) (PACF) of the model's residuals. If significant autocorrelation is detected, corrective measures are necessary. Common approaches include fitting models that explicitly parameterize the error structure (e.g., an autoregressive AR(1) model) or using robust standard error estimators (e.g., Newey-West standard errors) that are valid in the presence of autocorrelation.

### Interdisciplinary Frontiers: From Implementation Science to Hospital Epidemiology

The adaptability of ITS has made it a cornerstone methodology far beyond general public health. Its applications in specialized fields like implementation science and [hospital epidemiology](@entry_id:169682) showcase its full potential.

In **implementation science**, the focus is on evaluating strategies to promote the adoption and integration of evidence-based practices into routine care. For instance, a translational genomics program might introduce a new, rapid consent process to increase the proportion of families who enroll in a study. ITS is the ideal method to determine whether the new process led to an immediate and/or sustained increase in the weekly consent rate, while accounting for pre-existing trends and seasonal effects like holiday lulls. [@problem_id:5052213]

In **[hospital epidemiology](@entry_id:169682)**, ITS is invaluable for evaluating antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs), infection control bundles, and other quality improvement initiatives. A particularly sophisticated application involves modeling two linked outcomes: a *process measure* and a *clinical outcome*. For an ASP, the process measure could be antibiotic consumption (measured in Days of Therapy, or $DOT_t$), and the clinical outcome could be the monthly count of *Clostridioides difficile* infections ($Y_t$). A comprehensive analysis would involve two separate segmented regression models. The first would estimate the ASP's impact on $DOT_t$, accounting for autocorrelation and confounders like patient acuity and seasonality. The second model, for $Y_t$, would then not only estimate the direct impact of the ASP but also include the (lagged) $DOT_t$ term as a predictor. This allows researchers to disentangle the ASP's total effect on infections from the specific effect mediated through reduced antibiotic use. Such models must also control for a host of hospital-specific confounders, such as changes in diagnostic testing methods (e.g., a switch to more sensitive PCR-based tests) and environmental cleaning compliance, which powerfully demonstrates the analytical rigor required in modern clinical research.

### Conclusion: The Robustness and Versatility of ITS

The journey from a simple segmented regression to a multi-equation, confounder-adjusted Negative Binomial model highlights the maturation of Interrupted Time Series analysis as a [scientific method](@entry_id:143231). While its conceptual basis is straightforward, its modern application requires careful consideration of the data-generating process and potential threats to validity. The most rigorous studies enhance confidence in their findings by conducting **[falsification](@entry_id:260896) tests**, such as introducing a "placebo" intervention at a time point where no real intervention occurred. The absence of a significant effect at this placebo point strengthens the causal interpretation of the true intervention's effect. [@problem_id:4580361]

By providing a structured yet flexible framework for counterfactual analysis, ITS empowers researchers across medicine, public policy, economics, and beyond. It allows for the robust evaluation of interventions in their naturalistic settings, generating critical evidence to inform policy and practice when randomized experiments are not an option.
