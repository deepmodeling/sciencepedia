It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in applied statistics. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the change in internal consistency of a scale, as measured by Cronbach's alpha, before and after a cultural adaptation. The definition of Cronbach's alpha ($\\alpha$) in terms of item variances and total score variance is given by the formula:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k}{k-1} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sigma_i^2}{\\sigma_T^2} \\right) $$\nwhere $k$ is the number of items on the scale, $\\sigma_i^2$ is the variance of the $i$-th item, and $\\sigma_T^2$ is the variance of the total score, which is the sum of the item scores.\n\nThe problem requires us to calculate $\\Delta\\alpha = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{post}} - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{pre}}$. We will first compute the necessary components for the pre-adaptation alpha, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{pre}}$, and the post-adaptation alpha, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{post}}$.\n\nFor both scenarios, the number of items is $k=6$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the item variances for the pre-adaptation data, denoted as $\\sum \\sigma_{i, \\mathrm{pre}}^2$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sigma_{i, \\mathrm{pre}}^2 = 0.80 + 0.95 + 0.70 + 0.85 + 1.10 + 0.90 = 5.30 $$\nThe total-score variance for the pre-adaptation data is given as $\\sigma_{T, \\mathrm{pre}}^2 = 12.8$.\nWe can now write the expression for $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{pre}}$:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\mathrm{pre}} = \\frac{6}{6-1} \\left( 1 - \\frac{5.30}{12.8} \\right) = \\frac{6}{5} \\left( 1 - \\frac{5.30}{12.8} \\right) $$\n\nNext, we calculate the sum of the item variances for the post-adaptation data, denoted as $\\sum \\sigma_{i, \\mathrm{post}}^2$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sigma_{i, \\mathrm{post}}^2 = 0.85 + 0.90 + 0.75 + 0.80 + 1.05 + 0.95 = 5.30 $$\nNotably, the sum of item variances is identical in both scenarios. The total-score variance for the post-adaptation data is given as $\\sigma_{T, \\mathrm{post}}^2 = 14.5$.\nWe can now write the expression for $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{post}}$:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\mathrm{post}} = \\frac{6}{6-1} \\left( 1 - \\frac{5.30}{14.5} \\right) = \\frac{6}{5} \\left( 1 - \\frac{5.30}{14.5} \\right) $$\n\nThe desired quantity is the change in alpha, $\\Delta\\alpha$:\n$$ \\Delta\\alpha = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{post}} - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{pre}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{post}}$ and $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{pre}}$:\n$$ \\Delta\\alpha = \\left[ \\frac{6}{5} \\left( 1 - \\frac{5.30}{14.5} \\right) \\right] - \\left[ \\frac{6}{5} \\left( 1 - \\frac{5.30}{12.8} \\right) \\right] $$\nWe can factor out the common term $\\frac{6}{5}$:\n$$ \\Delta\\alpha = \\frac{6}{5} \\left[ \\left( 1 - \\frac{5.30}{14.5} \\right) - \\left( 1 - \\frac{5.30}{12.8} \\right) \\right] $$\n$$ \\Delta\\alpha = \\frac{6}{5} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{5.30}{14.5} - 1 + \\frac{5.30}{12.8} \\right] $$\n$$ \\Delta\\alpha = \\frac{6}{5} \\left( \\frac{5.30}{12.8} - \\frac{5.30}{14.5} \\right) $$\nWe can factor out the sum of item variances, $5.30$:\n$$ \\Delta\\alpha = \\frac{6}{5} \\times 5.30 \\left( \\frac{1}{12.8} - \\frac{1}{14.5} \\right) $$\nTo compute the difference of fractions, we find a common denominator:\n$$ \\Delta\\alpha = \\frac{6 \\times 5.30}{5} \\left( \\frac{14.5 - 12.8}{12.8 \\times 14.5} \\right) $$\nLet's perform the calculations:\n$$ 14.5 - 12.8 = 1.7 $$\n$$ 12.8 \\times 14.5 = 185.6 $$\n$$ 6 \\times 5.30 = 31.8 $$\nSubstituting these values back into the expression for $\\Delta\\alpha$:\n$$ \\Delta\\alpha = \\frac{31.8}{5} \\left( \\frac{1.7}{185.6} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta\\alpha = \\frac{31.8 \\times 1.7}{5 \\times 185.6} = \\frac{54.06}{928} $$\nNow, we compute the final decimal value:\n$$ \\Delta\\alpha = 0.05825430... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $5$, $8$, $2$, and $5$. The fifth significant figure is $4$, so we round down.\n$$ \\Delta\\alpha \\approx 0.05825 $$\nThis positive change indicates an improvement in the internal consistency of the scale after the cultural adaptation.
