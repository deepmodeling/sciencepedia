It is defined as:\n$$ \\bar{Y} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{J} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} Y_{ij} $$\nThe variance of the overall mean, which we will denote $\\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{\\text{cluster}})$, is:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{\\text{cluster}}) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{J} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} Y_{ij}\\right) = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{J} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} Y_{ij}\\right) $$\nLet $T_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} Y_{ij}$ be the total outcome for cluster $i$. The grand sum can be written as $\\sum_{i=1}^{J} T_i$. Since observations from different communities are independent, the cluster totals $T_i$ are independent variables. The variance of a sum of independent variables is the sum of their variances:\n$$ \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{J} T_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{J} \\text{Var}(T_i) $$\nNext, we calculate the variance of a single cluster total, $\\text{Var}(T_i)$.\n$$ \\text{Var}(T_i) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{m} Y_{ij}\\right) $$\nUsing the general formula for the variance of a sum of correlated variables:\n$$ \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{m} Y_{ij}\\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\text{Var}(Y_{ij}) + \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\sum_{k \\neq j} \\text{Cov}(Y_{ij}, Y_{ik}) $$\nWe are given that $\\text{Var}(Y_{ij}) = \\sigma^2$. The ICC, $\\rho$, is defined as $\\rho = \\text{Corr}(Y_{ij}, Y_{ik})$ for $j \\neq k$.

The sum of covariances contains $m(m-1)$ terms, each equal to $\\rho \\sigma^2$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\text{Var}(T_i)$:\n$$ \\text{Var}(T_i) = m\\sigma^2 + m(m-1)\\rho \\sigma^2 = m\\sigma^2 [1 + (m-1)\\rho] $$\nSince all clusters are identical in structure, this variance is the same for all $i$. The variance of the grand sum is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{J} \\text{Var}(T_i) = J \\cdot \\left(m \\sigma^2 [1 + (m-1)\\rho]\\right) $$\nGiven $n=Jm$, this becomes:\n$$ \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{J} T_i\\right) = n \\sigma^2 [1 + (m-1)\\rho] $$\nSubstituting this back into the formula for $\\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{\\text{cluster}})$:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{\\text{cluster}}) = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\left( n \\sigma^2 [1 + (m-1)\\rho] \\right) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} [1 + (m-1)\\rho] $$\nFor the denominator of the design effect, we consider the variance of the mean from a simple random sample (SRS) of size $n$. In an SRS, all observations are independent, so all covariances are zero.\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{\\text{SRS}}) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{n} Y_k\\right) = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\text{Var}(Y_k) = \\frac{1}{n^2} (n\\sigma^2) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} $$\nThe design effect (DEFF) is the ratio of these two variances:\n$$ \\text{DEFF} = \\frac{\\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{\\text{cluster}})}{\\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{\\text{SRS}})} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} [1 + (m-1)\\rho]}{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}} = 1 + (m-1)\\rho $$\nThis is the derived expression for the design effect.\n\n### Numerical Calculation of Design Effect\nUsing the provided values $m=15$ and $\\rho=0.05$:\n$$ \\text{DEFF} = 1 + (15 - 1)(0.05) = 1 + (14)(0.05) = 1 + 0.7 = 1.7 $$\nRounded to four significant figures, the design effect is $1.700$.\n\n### Calculation of Effective Sample Size\nThe effective sample size, $n_{\\text{eff}}$, is the size of an equivalent simple random sample having the same variance of the mean as the clustered sample.\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{\\text{SRS with } n_{\\text{eff}}}) = \\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{\\text{cluster}}) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n_{\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} [1 + (m-1)\\rho] = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} \\times \\text{DEFF} $$\nSolving for $n_{\\text{eff}}$ yields:\n$$ n_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{n}{\\text{DEFF}} $$\nSubstituting the values $n=600$ and $\\text{DEFF}=1.7$:\n$$ n_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{600}{1.7} \\approx 352.941176... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the effective sample size is $352.9$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1.700 & 352.9 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4578618"}, {"introduction": "A well-designed trial must have sufficient statistical power to detect a meaningful intervention effect.

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two main derivations: first, the sampling variance of the difference in arm means, and second, the formula for the number of clusters per arm, $k$. Finally, it asks for a numerical calculation of $k$.\n\nLet $Y_{ij}$ be the outcome for individual $j$ in cluster $i$.
