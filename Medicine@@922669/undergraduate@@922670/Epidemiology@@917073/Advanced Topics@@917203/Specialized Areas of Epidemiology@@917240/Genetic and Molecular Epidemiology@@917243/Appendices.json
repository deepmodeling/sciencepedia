It presents a standard problem in statistical genetics: performing an exact test for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). All necessary data and definitions are provided.\n\nThe problem requires an exact test for HWE in the control group. The observed genotype counts for the controls are given as $(n_{AA}^{\\mathrm{ctrl}}, n_{Aa}^{\\mathrm{ctrl}}, n_{aa}^{\\mathrm{ctrl}}) = (16, 0, 4)$.\n\nThe total number of individuals in the control sample is $n = n_{AA}^{\\mathrm{ctrl}} + n_{Aa}^{\\mathrm{ctrl}} + n_{aa}^{\\mathrm{ctrl}} = 16 + 0 + 4 = 20$.\n\nUnder the null hypothesis of HWE, for a population with allele frequencies $p_A$ and $p_a$ for alleles $A$ and $a$ respectively ($p_A + p_a = 1$), the genotype frequencies are given by $P(AA) = p_A^2$, $P(Aa) = 2p_A p_a$, and $P(aa) = p_a^2$. The problem defines the frequency of allele $a$ as $p_a = p$, so the frequencies are $P(AA) = (1-p)^2$, $P(Aa) = 2p(1-p)$, and $P(aa) = p^2$.\n\nThe genotype counts $(N_{AA}, N_{Aa}, N_{aa})$ in a sample of size $n$ are modeled as a draw from a multinomial distribution. The probability of observing a specific set of counts $(n_{AA}, n_{Aa}, n_{aa})$ is:\n$$ P(N_{AA}=n_{AA}, N_{Aa}=n_{Aa}, N_{aa}=n_{aa}) = \\frac{n!}{n_{AA}! n_{Aa}! n_{aa}!} [P(AA)]^{n_{AA}} [P(Aa)]^{n_{Aa}} [P(aa)]^{n_{aa}} $$\nSubstituting the HWE probabilities, we get the likelihood function for the unknown parameter $p$:\n$$ L(p; n_{AA}, n_{Aa}, n_{aa}) = \\frac{n!}{n_{AA}! n_{Aa}! n_{aa}!} ((1-p)^2)^{n_{AA}} (2p(1-p))^{n_{Aa}} (p^2)^{n_{aa}} $$\n$$ L(p) = \\frac{n!}{n_{AA}! n_{Aa}! n_{aa}!} 2^{n_{Aa}} (1-p)^{2n_{AA}+n_{Aa}} p^{n_{Aa}+2n_{aa}} $$\nLet $N_a$ be the total count of allele $a$ in the sample, where $N_a = n_{Aa} + 2n_{aa}$. The total number of alleles in the sample is $2n$. The count of allele $A$ is $N_A = 2n_{AA} + n_{Aa} = 2n - N_a$. The likelihood can be rewritten as:\n$$ L(p) = \\frac{n!}{n_{AA}! n_{Aa}! n_{aa}!} 2^{n_{Aa}} (1-p)^{2n-N_a} p^{N_a} $$\nBy the Fisher-Neyman factorization theorem, $N_a$ is a sufficient statistic for the nuisance parameter $p$. To create a test that is independent of $p$, we condition on the observed value of the sufficient statistic. For the given control data, the observed count of allele $a$ is $N_a^{\\mathrm{obs}} = n_{Aa}^{\\mathrm{ctrl}} + 2n_{aa}^{\\mathrm{ctrl}} = 0 + 2(4) = 8$.\n\nWe need to find the conditional probability of the genotype counts given $n=20$ and $N_a=8$:\n$$ P(N_{AA}=n_{AA}, N_{Aa}=n_{Aa}, N_{aa}=n_{aa} \\mid N_a=8, n=20) $$\nThis is the ratio of the probability of observing the specific genotype counts to the probability of observing the total allele count $N_a=8$. The total number of $a$ alleles in a sample of $2n$ alleles follows a binomial distribution $N_a \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(2n, p)$. Thus, $P(N_a=k) = \\binom{2n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{2n-k}$.\nThe conditional probability is:\n$$ P(\\text{counts} \\mid N_a=8) = \\frac{P(\\text{counts})}{P(N_a=8)} = \\frac{\\frac{n!}{n_{AA}! n_{Aa}! n_{aa}!} 2^{n_{Aa}} p^8 (1-p)^{32}}{\\binom{2n}{8} p^8 (1-p)^{32}} = \\frac{n! 2^{n_{Aa}}}{n_{AA}! n_{Aa}! n_{aa}! \\binom{2n}{8}} $$\nThis probability is free of $p$. Given that $n=20$ and $N_a=8$, the genotype counts are constrained:\n$n_{AA} + n_{Aa} + n_{aa} = 20$\n$2n_{AA} + n_{Aa} = 2(20) - 8 = 32$\n$n_{Aa} + 2n_{aa} = 8$\n\nFrom these constraints, we can express $n_{AA}$ and $n_{aa}$ in terms of $n_{Aa}$:\n$n_{aa} = (8 - n_{Aa})/2$\n$n_{AA} = (32 - n_{Aa})/2$\nFor $n_{AA}$ and $n_{aa}$ to be integers, $n_{Aa}$ must be an even number. Also, all counts must be non-negative, so $n_{Aa} \\ge 0$, $8 - n_{Aa} \\ge 0 \\implies n_{Aa} \\le 8$.\nThus, the possible values for the heterozygote count $n_{Aa}$ are $\\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$.\n\nThe two-sided exact $p$-value is the sum of probabilities of all possible genotype configurations (for the fixed $N_a=8, n=20$) that have a probability less than or equal to that of the observed configuration $(16, 0, 4)$. The observed configuration corresponds to $n_{Aa}=0$.\n\nLet $f(k)$ be the term in the probability proportional to the configuration with $n_{Aa}=k$:\n$f(n_{Aa}) = \\frac{2^{n_{Aa}}}{n_{AA}! n_{Aa}! n_{aa}!}$.

A full comparison reveals that $P(n_{Aa}=0)$ is the minimum probability among all possible configurations.\nTherefore, the only configuration with probability less than or equal to the observed C is the observed one itself. The $p$-value is the conditional probability of observing $n_{Aa}=0$.\n$$p\\text{-value} = P(n_{Aa}=0 \\mid N_a=8) = \\frac{f(0)}{\\sum_{k \\in \\{0,2,4,6,8\\}} f(k)}$$\nLet $f(0)=1$ (as a reference unit).

The $\\chi^2$ test statistic for HWE, $\\sum (O-E)^2/E$, is approximately $\\chi^2$-distributed with one degree of freedom. This approximation is based on the normal approximation to the multinomial distribution of genotype counts. The validity of this approximation fundamentally requires that the expected count for each cell (genotype) is not too small. A widely accepted guideline is that all expected counts should be at least $5$.\n\nTo calculate the expected counts for the control group, we first estimate the allele frequency $p$ from the sample data. The maximum likelihood estimate is the sample allele frequency:\n$$\\hat{p} = \\frac{n_{Aa}^{\\mathrm{ctrl}} + 2n_{aa}^{\\mathrm{ctrl}}}{2n} = \\frac{0 + 2(4)}{2(20)} = \\frac{8}{40} = 0.2$$\nThe expected genotype counts under HWE are:\n$E_{AA} = n(1-\\hat{p})^2 = 20(0.8)^2 = 20(0.64) = 12.8$\n$E_{Aa} = n(2\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})) = 20(2 \\cdot 0.2 \\cdot 0.8) = 20(0.32) = 6.4$\n$E_{aa} = n(\\hat{p}^2) = 20(0.2)^2 = 20(0.04) = 0.8$\n\nThe expected count for the $aa$ genotype is $E_{aa} = 0.8$, which is substantially less than the conventional threshold of $5$. Because one of the expected counts is very small, the theoretical conditions for the $\\chi^2$ approximation are not met. Therefore, the large-sample $\\chi^2$ test is not valid for this dataset, and the use of an exact test is necessary and appropriate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.30 \\times 10^{-5}}$$", "id": "4595384"}, {"introduction": "When we scale up from analyzing a single genetic marker to a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) involving millions, new challenges emerge. One of the most common is the uniform inflation of test statistics, which can be caused by subtle, unmeasured population structure or cryptic relatedness, leading to a surplus of false-positive findings. This exercise introduces the concept of Genomic Control, a foundational method for diagnosing and correcting for such inflation, ensuring that the reported associations are more likely to be genuine [@problem_id:4595350].", "problem": "A Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) evaluates single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for association with a quantitative trait using a standard score test whose test statistic for each SNP is assumed, under the null hypothesis of no association, to follow a chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom, denoted $\\chi^{2}_{1}$. Cryptic population structure and relatedness can induce uniform multiplicative inflation of all test statistics away from their null distribution. The Genomic Control (GC) approach characterizes this inflation using the GC factor, $\\lambda$, defined as the ratio of the empirical median of the observed genome-wide test statistics to the median of the $\\chi^{2}_{1}$ distribution. Let $m_{0}$ denote the median of the $\\chi^{2}_{1}$ distribution.\n\nAssume that the inflation mechanism multiplies each null test statistic by a common factor, and that $\\lambda$ consistently estimates this factor via the ratio of medians.

Round your final numerical answer to four significant figures.\n\nIn your derivation, clearly state the assumptions under which GC corrects type I error inflation, and explain when such adjustment could deflate true signals arising from widespread polygenicity rather than confounding. Your final reported quantity must be the single adjusted value for the focal SNP.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the Genomic Control (GC) adjusted test statistic, $T^{\\mathrm{GC}}$, and its calculation for a specific single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The derivation must be based on the provided definitions.\n\nLet $T$ represent a test statistic from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). Under the null hypothesis ($H_0$) of no association between a given SNP and the trait, the test statistic is assumed to follow a central chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom, denoted as $\\chi^{2}_{1}$. Let $m_0$ be the median of this theoretical null distribution. Specifically, for a $\\chi^{2}_{1}$ distribution, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is $F(x) = P(X \\le x) = \\text{erf}(\\sqrt{x/2})$. The median $m_0$ is the value such that $F(m_0) = 0.5$. This gives $\\text{erf}(\\sqrt{m_0/2}) = 0.5$, which solves to $m_0 = 2(\\text{erf}^{-1}(0.5))^2 \\approx 0.454937$.\n\nThe problem states that cryptic population structure induces a uniform multiplicative inflation of the test statistics. Let $T_{\\text{null}}$ be a random variable representing a test statistic that correctly follows the $\\chi^{2}_{1}$ distribution. The observed, inflated test statistic, $T_{\\text{obs}}$, is modeled as being multiplied by a common inflation factor, $c$.\n$$T_{\\text{obs}} = c \\cdot T_{\\text{null}}$$\nThis model assumes that this inflation factor $c$ is constant for all SNPs across the genome that are truly null.\n\nThe Genomic Control factor, $\\lambda$, is defined as the ratio of the empirical median of the observed genome-wide test statistics, which we denote $\\text{median}(T_{\\text{obs}})$, to the theoretical median of the null distribution, $m_0$.\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{\\text{median}(T_{\\text{obs}})}{m_0}$$\nA crucial assumption in GWAS is that the vast majority of tested SNPs are not associated with the trait, i.e., they are true nulls. Therefore, the empirical median of all observed statistics is primarily determined by the distribution of these null SNPs. Under this assumption, we can approximate the empirical median as:\n$$\\text{median}(T_{\\text{obs}}) \\approx \\text{median}(c \\cdot T_{\\text{null}})$$\nA fundamental property of the median is that for any positive constant $k$ and random variable $X$, $\\text{median}(kX) = k \\cdot \\text{median}(X)$. Applying this property, we get:\n$$\\text{median}(T_{\\text{obs}}) \\approx c \\cdot \\text{median}(T_{\\text{null}})$$\nSince $T_{\\text{null}}$ follows a $\\chi^{2}_{1}$ distribution, its median is $m_0$. Thus:\n$$\\text{median}(T_{\\text{obs}}) \\approx c \\cdot m_0$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda \\approx \\frac{c \\cdot m_0}{m_0} = c$$\nThis shows that the GC factor $\\lambda$ is an estimate of the uniform multiplicative inflation factor $c$. The problem states that $\\lambda$ consistently estimates this factor, which validates our derivation.\n\nThe goal is to define an adjusted test statistic, $T^{\\mathrm{GC}}$, that corrects for this inflation, thereby restoring its distribution under the null to the theoretical $\\chi^{2}_{1}$ distribution. To reverse the multiplicative inflation by the factor $\\lambda$, we must divide the observed test statistic by $\\lambda$. For any given SNP with an observed statistic $T_{\\text{obs}}$, the GC-adjusted statistic $T^{\\mathrm{GC}}$ is:\n$$T^{\\mathrm{GC}} = \\frac{T_{\\text{obs}}}{\\lambda}$$\nTo verify that this adjustment restores the genome-wide median to $m_0$, consider the median of the adjusted statistics:\n$$\\text{median}(T^{\\mathrm{GC}}) = \\text{median}\\left(\\frac{T_{\\text{obs}}}{\\lambda}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\text{median}(T_{\\text{obs}})$$\nFrom the definition of $\\lambda$, we have $\\text{median}(T_{\\text{obs}}) = \\lambda \\cdot m_0$. Substituting this gives:\n$$\\text{median}(T^{\\mathrm{GC}}) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} (\\lambda \\cdot m_0) = m_0$$\nThis confirms that the proposed correction correctly scales the median of the test statistics back to its expected value under the null hypothesis.\n\nThe fundamental assumption for Genomic Control to be a valid method for controlling type I error is that the inflation of test statistics (i.e., $\\lambda  1$) is due entirely to systematic bias, such as population stratification and cryptic relatedness, and not to true biological effects. This assumes a \"sparse-effect\" genetic architecture where the vast majority of SNPs have no effect on the trait. When these conditions hold, dividing by $\\lambda$ correctly adjusts the P-values for null SNPs and prevents an excess of false positives.\n\nHowever, this adjustment can deflate true signals under a different genetic architecture. For a trait that is highly polygenic, meaning that a large number of variants across the genome have small but real effects, the null hypothesis is technically false for a large fraction of SNPs. The cumulative effect of these many small, true associations will cause the distribution of test statistics to deviate from the theoretical null, resulting in an inflation factor $\\lambda  1$. In this scenario, the inflation factor $\\lambda$ captures not only bias from population structure but also a component from true, widespread polygenicity. Applying the standard GC correction $T^{\\mathrm{GC}} = T_{\\text{obs}}/\\lambda$ will improperly treat the portion of inflation due to polygenicity as if it were bias. This over-correction scales down all test statistics, including those for genuinely associated SNPs, reducing statistical power and making it harder to detect true associations. This limitation has led to the development of more advanced methods, such as LD Score regression, which can distinguish between inflation from confounding and that from polygenicity.\n\nNow, we apply the derived formula to the focal SNP. The given values are:\nObserved chi-squared statistic, $T_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 9.84$.\nStudy-wide GC factor, $\\lambda = 1.23$.\n\nThe adjusted chi-squared value $T^{\\mathrm{GC}}$ is calculated as:\n$$T^{\\mathrm{GC}} = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{obs}}}{\\lambda} = \\frac{9.84}{1.23}$$\n$$T^{\\mathrm{GC}} = 8$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$T^{\\mathrm{GC}} = 8.000$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{8.000}\n$$", "id": "4595350"}, {"introduction": "While Genomic Control corrects for overall inflation, it cannot distinguish between inflation caused by bias and that arising from true, widespread polygenicity—where thousands of genetic variants each contribute a small effect to a trait.

A quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot indicates deviation from the null line, consistent with inflation of test statistics. To distinguish whether this inflation arises from true polygenicity or confounding (for example, population stratification or cryptic relatedness), you are asked to reason from first principles of the polygenic model and Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) properties, and then use LD Score Regression (LDSC).\n\nUse the following foundational bases:\n- Under the null of no association without confounding, the one-degree-of-freedom chi-square statistic has expected value $1$.\n- Under a polygenic additive model with many small independent SNP effects and standardized inputs, the expected variance in phenotype tagged by SNP $j$ increases with its LD score $l_{j}$, where the LD score is defined as the sum of squared correlations of SNP $j$ with other SNPs in the region.

A unique solution exists.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Verdict:**\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. I will proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Solution\n\n**Derivation of the LD Score Regression Model**\n\nThe problem asks to derive a linear decomposition of the expected $\\chi_{j}^{2}$ statistic. We start from the provided foundational bases.\n\n1.  **Baseline:** In the absence of any genetic effect or confounding, a one-degree-of-freedom chi-square test statistic is expected to have a mean of $1$. This establishes the baseline for our model: $E[\\chi_{j}^{2}]_{\\text{null}} = 1$.\n\n2.  **Polygenicity:** The problem states that under a polygenic model, the expected noncentrality of $\\chi_{j}^{2}$ increases with its LD score, $l_{j}$. Let's formalize this. The $\\chi_{j}^{2}$ statistic for SNP $j$ from a simple linear regression with standardized genotype $G_j$ and phenotype $Y$ is approximately $N \\hat{\\beta}_{j, \\text{marginal}}^{2}$, where $\\hat{\\beta}_{j, \\text{marginal}}$ is the estimated marginal effect size. The expected value of the statistic is approximately $1 + N E[\\hat{\\beta}_{j, \\text{marginal}}^{2}]$. The marginal effect of SNP $j$ captures its own causal effect, $\\beta_j$, plus effects from all other SNPs ($k$) that are in LD with it, weighted by the correlation $r_{jk}$: $\\beta_{j, \\text{marginal}} \\approx \\sum_{k} r_{jk} \\beta_k$. The expected squared marginal effect is $E[\\beta_{j, \\text{marginal}}^{2}] = E[(\\sum_{k} r_{jk} \\beta_k)^2]$. Assuming causal effects $\\beta_k$ are independent with mean $0$ and variance $h^2/M$ (where $h^2$ is the total SNP-heritability distributed across $M$ causal SNPs), this simplifies to $E[\\beta_{j, \\text{marginal}}^{2}] = \\sum_{k} r_{jk}^{2} E[\\beta_k^2] = (\\sum_{k} r_{jk}^{2}) \\frac{h^2}{M} = l_j \\frac{h^2}{M}$.\n    Therefore, the contribution to the expected chi-square statistic from polygenicity is $N l_j \\frac{h^2}{M}$.\n\n3.  **Confounding:** The problem states that confounding (e.g., from population stratification or cryptic relatedness) adds a constant inflation term, $C$, that does not depend on the LD score $l_j$. This term affects all SNPs approximately equally.\n\nCombining these three components, we arrive at the linear model for the expected value of the chi-square statistic for SNP $j$:\n$$E[\\chi_{j}^{2}] = 1 + N \\frac{h^{2}}{M} l_{j} + C$$\nThis equation is a linear model of the form $E[Y_j] = a + b X_j$, where the dependent variable is $Y_j = \\chi_j^2$ and the independent variable is $X_j = l_j$. The model parameters are:\n-   **Slope:** $b = \\frac{N h^{2}}{M}$. This term quantifies the contribution of polygenicity. A higher LD score $l_j$ means the SNP tags more genetic variation, leading to a stronger expected association signal.\n-   **Intercept:** $a = 1 + C$. This term captures the baseline expectation of $1$ plus any inflation $C$ due to confounding.\n\n**Estimation using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**\n\nWe are asked to fit a regression of $\\chi_j^2$ on $l_j$ across all $M$ SNPs:\n$$ \\chi_{j}^{2} = a + b l_{j} + \\epsilon_{j} $$\nThe OLS estimators for the slope ($\\hat{b}$) and intercept ($\\hat{a}$) are calculated from sample moments. The formula for the slope estimator is:\n$$ \\hat{b} = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(l, \\chi^{2})}{\\operatorname{Var}(l)} $$\nThe formula for the intercept estimator is:\n$$ \\hat{a} = \\overline{\\chi^{2}} - \\hat{b} \\bar{l} $$\nThese estimators provide estimates for the true slope $b$ and intercept $a$.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nUsing the provided sample moments:\n- $\\operatorname{Cov}(l, \\chi^{2}) = 0.39$\n- $\\operatorname{Var}(l) = 65$\n- $\\overline{\\chi^{2}} = 1.56$\n- $\\bar{l} = 85$\n\nFirst, we compute the OLS slope, $\\hat{b}$:\n$$ \\hat{b} = \\frac{0.39}{65} = 0.006 $$\n\nNext, we compute the OLS intercept, $\\hat{a}$:\n$$ \\hat{a} = 1.56 - (0.006 \\times 85) = 1.56 - 0.51 = 1.05 $$\n\nRounding to four significant figures as required:\n- $\\hat{b} = 0.006000$\n- $\\hat{a} = 1.050$\n\n**Interpretation and Final Computations**\n\n1.  **SNP-heritability ($h^2$)**:\n    We use the relationship $\\hat{b} \\approx \\frac{N h^{2}}{M}$ to estimate $h^2$.\n    $$ \\hat{h}^{2} = \\frac{M \\hat{b}}{N} $$\n    Substituting the values for $M$, $N$, and our estimated $\\hat{b}$:\n    $$ \\hat{h}^{2} = \\frac{1{,}000{,}000 \\times 0.006}{200{,}000} = \\frac{6000}{200000} = \\frac{6}{200} = 0.03 $$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, $\\hat{h}^2 = 0.03000$.\n\n2.  **Fraction of inflation from confounding**:\n    The total observed inflation of the mean test statistic is $\\overline{\\chi^{2}} - 1 = 1.56 - 1 = 0.56$.\n    The intercept $\\hat{a}$ is an estimate of $1 + C$, where $C$ is the inflation due to confounding. Thus, the portion of inflation attributable to confounding is estimated by $\\hat{a} - 1$.\n    $$ \\text{Confounding Inflation} = \\hat{a} - 1 = 1.050 - 1 = 0.050 $$\n    The fraction of the total observed inflation that is due to confounding is:\n    $$ \\frac{\\hat{a} - 1}{\\overline{\\chi^{2}} - 1} = \\frac{0.050}{0.56} \\approx 0.0892857... $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, this fraction is $0.08929$.\n\nThis analysis indicates that the vast majority of the observed inflation in test statistics ($\\overline{\\chi^2}=1.56$) is due to true polygenic signal, not confounding. Specifically, the intercept of $1.050$ suggests only a modest level of confounding, while the non-zero slope of $0.006000$ provides strong evidence for a polygenic architecture, yielding a SNP-heritability estimate of $3\\%$.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n- LDSC intercept $\\hat{a} = 1.050$\n- LDSC slope $\\hat{b} = 0.006000$\n- SNP-heritability estimate $\\hat{h}^2 = 0.03000$\n- Fraction of inflation from confounding = $0.08929$\n\nThese values will be placed into a row matrix for the final answer.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1.050  0.006000  0.03000  0.08929 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4595371"}]}
