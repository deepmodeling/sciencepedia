The Time-Weighted Average (TWA) is a fundamental metric used to summarize these fluctuating concentrations over a work shift into a single, representative value.

Your final numeric answer should contain the TWA and the cumulative exposure only.", "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of occupational hygiene and exposure assessment, which are core components of environmental and occupational epidemiology. The provided data are self-contained, consistent, and sufficient for a unique solution. The total duration of the measured segments, $\\sum_{k=1}^{5} \\Delta t_k = 90 + 120 + 30 + 150 + 90 = 480$ minutes, is equal to the total shift duration of $8$ hours ($8 \\times 60 = 480$ minutes). All terms are clearly defined, and the objectives are unambiguous.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities: the cumulative exposure and the time-weighted average (TWA) concentration, followed by an interpretation of the TWA.\n\nFirst, we calculate the cumulative exposure. The cumulative exposure, denoted $E_{cum}$, is defined as the area under the concentration–time curve. Mathematically, this is the integral of the concentration function $c(t)$ over the total time period $T$.\n$$E_{cum} = \\int_{0}^{T} c(t) \\, dt$$\nSince the concentration is given as a piecewise-constant function over $N=5$ segments, the integral becomes a summation:\n$$E_{cum} = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} c_k \\Delta t_k$$\nwhere $c_k$ is the constant concentration during the $k$-th segment and $\\Delta t_k$ is the duration of that segment.\n\nThe problem requires the cumulative exposure to be expressed in units of $\\mathrm{mg\\,m^{-3}\\cdot h}$. Therefore, we must convert the given durations from minutes to hours. The conversion factor is $1 \\text{ hour} = 60 \\text{ minutes}$.\n$\\Delta t_1 = 90 \\text{ min} = \\frac{90}{60} \\text{ h} = 1.5 \\text{ h}$\n$\\Delta t_2 = 120 \\text{ min} = \\frac{120}{60} \\text{ h} = 2.0 \\text{ h}$\n$\\Delta t_3 = 30 \\text{ min} = \\frac{30}{60} \\text{ h} = 0.5 \\text{ h}$\n$\\Delta t_4 = 150 \\text{ min} = \\frac{150}{60} \\text{ h} = 2.5 \\text{ h}$\n$\\Delta t_5 = 90 \\text{ min} = \\frac{90}{60} \\text{ h} = 1.5 \\text{ h}$\n\nThe total duration is $T = \\sum_{k=1}^{5} \\Delta t_k = 1.5 + 2.0 + 0.5 + 2.5 + 1.5 = 8.0 \\text{ h}$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the cumulative exposure:\n$$E_{cum} = (85~\\mathrm{mg/m^3} \\times 1.5~\\mathrm{h}) + (60~\\mathrm{mg/m^3} \\times 2.0~\\mathrm{h}) + (5~\\mathrm{mg/m^3} \\times 0.5~\\mathrm{h}) + (40~\\mathrm{mg/m^3} \\times 2.5~\\mathrm{h}) + (100~\\mathrm{mg/m^3} \\times 1.5~\\mathrm{h})$$\n$$E_{cum} = 127.5 + 120 + 2.5 + 100 + 150$$\n$$E_{cum} = 500~\\mathrm{mg \\cdot h \\cdot m^{-3}}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the cumulative exposure is $5.00 \\times 10^2~\\mathrm{mg \\cdot h \\cdot m^{-3}}$.\n\nSecond, we compute the time-weighted average (TWA) concentration. The TWA is defined as the cumulative exposure divided by the total duration of the period of interest.\n$$\\text{TWA} = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{T} c(t) \\, dt}{T} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} c_k \\Delta t_k}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\Delta t_k}$$\nUsing the cumulative exposure we just calculated and the total duration $T=8 \\text{ h}$:\n$$\\text{TWA} = \\frac{500~\\mathrm{mg \\cdot h \\cdot m^{-3}}}{8~\\mathrm{h}}$$\n$$\\text{TWA} = 62.5~\\mathrm{mg/m^3}$$\nThis result is already expressed with three significant figures.\n\nThird, we interpret how the TWA relates to the inhaled dose. The total inhaled dose ($D$) of a substance over a time period $T$ is the integral of the rate of intake. The rate of intake depends on the ambient concentration $c(t)$, the worker's breathing rate $R_B$ (volume of air inhaled per unit time), and the fraction of the inhaled substance that is absorbed by the body, $F_A$ (a dimensionless value between $0$ and $1$).\nThe instantaneous rate of dose absorption is:\n$$\\frac{dD}{dt} = c(t) \\cdot R_B \\cdot F_A$$\nThe total dose over the shift is the integral of this rate from $t=0$ to $t=T$:\n$$D_{total} = \\int_{0}^{T} c(t) \\cdot R_B \\cdot F_A \\, dt$$\nThe problem specifies that the breathing rate $R_B$ and absorption fraction $F_A$ are constant. Therefore, they can be factored out of the integral:\n$$D_{total} = R_B \\cdot F_A \\cdot \\int_{0}^{T} c(t) \\, dt$$\nFrom the definition of TWA, we know that $\\int_{0}^{T} c(t) \\, dt = \\text{TWA} \\cdot T$. Substituting this into the equation for total dose gives:\n$$D_{total} = R_B \\cdot F_A \\cdot (\\text{TWA} \\cdot T)$$\nThis equation demonstrates that, for constant breathing rate and absorption fraction, the total inhaled dose over a work shift is directly proportional to the TWA concentration. The TWA represents the equivalent constant concentration that would result in the same total dose over the entire shift as the actual, fluctuating concentration profile. It effectively normalizes the variable exposure to a single, easily interpretable value for risk assessment.\n\nThe final numeric answer requires the TWA in $\\mathrm{mg\\,m^{-3}}$ and the cumulative exposure in $\\mathrm{mg\\,m^{-3}\\cdot h}$, both rounded to three significant figures.\nTWA = $62.5~\\mathrm{mg\\,m^{-3}}$\nCumulative Exposure = $5.00 \\times 10^2~\\mathrm{mg\\,m^{-3}\\cdot h}$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 62.5 & 5.00 \\times 10^2 \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "4589734"}, {"introduction": "To study chronic diseases, epidemiologists must often reconstruct a person's exposure history over decades, a task complicated by job changes, varying work schedules, and the implementation of safety controls.

Job changes are critical: the shift to the high-exposure 'Concrete cutter' job ($I_{CC} = 0.060~\\mathrm{mg/m^3}$) significantly increased the rate of exposure accumulation. The hour-based time-weighting shows that overtime (Segments $3$, $4$, $5$, with $H=1.25$) accelerates accumulation, while part-time work (Segment $6$, with $H=0.5$) slows it. Control measures have a large impact: the respirator in Segment $4$ reduced the cumulative exposure for that year to $0.02775~\\mathrm{mg/m^3 \\cdot years}$, substantially lower than the exposure in Segment $5$ ($0.075~\\mathrm{mg/m^3 \\cdot years}$) for the same job and hours but without a respirator. Similarly, the wet suppression in Segment $2$ reduced exposure compared to the baseline in Segment $1$.
