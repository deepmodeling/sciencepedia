This means that $1 - 0.5529 = 0.4471$, or approximately $44.7\\%$ of all positive results are false positives. If the prevalence were even lower, say $\\pi = 0.01$, the $PPV$ would drop to approximately $0.19$, implying that over $80\\%$ of positive results would be false positives.\n\nThe epidemiologic implication is critical: in low-prevalence settings, a positive test result from a single biomarker, even one with high sensitivity and specificity, has a low probability of indicating true exposure. A substantial proportion of positive results will be incorrect (false positives), making the biomarker unreliable for individual case confirmation without further verification.

Using the model $X^{\\ast} = X + U$ and the property that the variance of a sum of independent random variables is the sum of their variances:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(X^{\\ast}) = \\mathrm{Var}(X + U)\n$$\nGiven that $X$ and $U$ are independent, we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(X^{\\ast}) = \\mathrm{Var}(X) + \\mathrm{Var}(U) = \\sigma_{b}^{2} + \\sigma_{w}^{2}\n$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the covariance between the outcome $Y$ and the observed measurement $X^{\\ast}$, $\\mathrm{Cov}(Y, X^{\\ast})$. We substitute the expressions for $Y$ and $X^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Cov}(Y, X^{\\ast}) = \\mathrm{Cov}(\\alpha + \\beta X + \\varepsilon, X + U)\n$$\nUsing the bilinearity property of covariance:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Cov}(Y, X^{\\ast}) = \\mathrm{Cov}(\\alpha, X+U) + \\mathrm{Cov}(\\beta X, X+U) + \\mathrm{Cov}(\\varepsilon, X+U)\n$$\nLet's evaluate each term:\n-   $\\mathrm{Cov}(\\alpha, X+U) = 0$, since $\\alpha$ is a constant.\n-   $\\mathrm{Cov}(\\beta X, X+U) = \\beta \\mathrm{Cov}(X, X+U) = \\beta (\\mathrm{Cov}(X, X) + \\mathrm{Cov}(X, U))$.\n    -   $\\mathrm{Cov}(X, X) = \\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\sigma_{b}^{2}$.\n    -   $\\mathrm{Cov}(X, U) = 0$, because $X$ and $U$ are independent.\n    -   Therefore, $\\mathrm{Cov}(\\beta X, X+U) = \\beta \\sigma_{b}^{2}$.\n-   $\\mathrm{Cov}(\\varepsilon, X+U) = \\mathrm{Cov}(\\varepsilon, X) + \\mathrm{Cov}(\\varepsilon, U)$.\n    -   $\\mathrm{Cov}(\\varepsilon, X) = 0$, because $\\varepsilon$ and $X$ are independent.\n    -   $\\mathrm{Cov}(\\varepsilon, U) = 0$, because $\\varepsilon$ and $U$ are independent.\n    -   Therefore, $\\mathrm{Cov}(\\varepsilon, X+U) = 0$.\n\nCombining these results, the numerator becomes:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Cov}(Y, X^{\\ast}) = 0 + \\beta \\sigma_{b}^{2} + 0 = \\beta \\sigma_{b}^{2}\n$$\n\nNow, we can assemble the expression for the observed slope $\\beta^{\\ast}$ by substituting the derived expressions for the numerator and the denominator:\n$$\n\\beta^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\beta \\sigma_{b}^{2}}{\\sigma_{b}^{2} + \\sigma_{w}^{2}}\n$$\nThis relationship shows that the observed slope $\\beta^{\\ast}$ is an attenuated version of the true slope $\\beta$. The attenuation factor, $\\frac{\\sigma_{b}^{2}}{\\sigma_{b}^{2} + \\sigma_{w}^{2}}$, is known as the reliability ratio or intraclass correlation coefficient.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $\\beta^{\\ast}$ using the given values: $\\beta = 0.5$, $\\sigma_{b}^{2} = 0.8$, and $\\sigma_{w}^{2} = 1.2$.\n$$\n\\beta^{\\ast} = \\frac{(0.5)(0.8)}{0.8 + 1.2} = \\frac{0.4}{2.0} = 0.2\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\beta^{\\ast} = 0.2000\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2000}$$", "id": "4573601"}]}
