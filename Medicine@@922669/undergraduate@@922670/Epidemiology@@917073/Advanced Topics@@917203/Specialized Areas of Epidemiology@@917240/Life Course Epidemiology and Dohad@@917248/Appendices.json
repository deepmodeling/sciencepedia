For family $i \\in \\{1,\\dots, N\\}$, let $Y_{ij}$ denote the birthweight (in grams) of child $j \\in \\{1,2\\}$ and $S_{ij}$ denote the mother’s average number of cigarettes smoked per day during the pregnancy with child $j$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of econometrics and epidemiology, specifically using a fixed-effects model to address unobserved confounding variables.

The parameter of interest is $\\beta$, the causal effect of prenatal smoking on birthweight.\n\nTo eliminate the unobserved family fixed effect $\\alpha_i$, we can difference the equation between the two siblings within each family.\nFor the first sibling ($j=1$):\n$$\nY_{i1} = \\alpha_i + \\beta S_{i1} + u_{i1}\n$$\nFor the second sibling ($j=2$):\n$$\nY_{i2} = \\alpha_i + \\beta S_{i2} + u_{i2}\n$$\nSubtracting the equation for the first sibling from the equation for the second sibling yields:\n$$\n(Y_{i2} - Y_{i1}) = (\\alpha_i - \\alpha_i) + \\beta(S_{i2} - S_{i1}) + (u_{i2} - u_{i1})\n$$\nLet us define the within-family differences for family $i$ as:\n$\\Delta Y_i = Y_{i2} - Y_{i1}$\n$\\Delta S_i = S_{i2} - S_{i1}$\n$\\Delta u_i = u_{i2} - u_{i1}$\n\nSubstituting these definitions into the differenced equation gives a new linear model for each family $i$:\n$$\n\\Delta Y_i = \\beta \\Delta S_i + \\Delta u_i\n$$\nNote that the unobserved family-specific confounder $\\alpha_i$ has been eliminated. The problem specifies that we are to estimate $\\beta$ from this differenced equation, treating it as a simple linear regression model with a single regressor $\\Delta S_i$ and no intercept.\n\nThe estimator for $\\beta$, which we will denote $\\hat{\\beta}_{WF}$ (for \"within-family\"), is found by applying the principle of ordinary least squares (OLS). We seek the value of $\\hat{\\beta}_{WF}$ that minimizes the sum of squared residuals (SSR) over all $N$ families. The residual for family $i$ is $e_i = \\Delta Y_i - \\hat{\\beta}_{WF} \\Delta S_i$. The SSR is the objective function to be minimized:\n$$\nQ(\\hat{\\beta}_{WF}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} e_i^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\\Delta Y_i - \\hat{\\beta}_{WF} \\Delta S_i)^2\n$$\nTo find the minimum, we take the first derivative of $Q(\\hat{\\beta}_{WF})$ with respect to $\\hat{\\beta}_{WF}$ and set it to zero. Using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{dQ}{d\\hat{\\beta}_{WF}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} 2 (\\Delta Y_i - \\hat{\\beta}_{WF} \\Delta S_i) \\cdot (-\\Delta S_i) = 0\n$$\nDividing by $-2$ and distributing the $\\Delta S_i$ term:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( (\\Delta Y_i)(\\Delta S_i) - \\hat{\\beta}_{WF} (\\Delta S_i)^2 \\right) = 0\n$$\nSeparating the sums:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\\Delta Y_i)(\\Delta S_i) - \\hat{\\beta}_{WF} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\\Delta S_i)^2 = 0\n$$\nNow, we solve for $\\hat{\\beta}_{WF}$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_{WF} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\\Delta S_i)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\\Delta Y_i)(\\Delta S_i)\n$$\nThis gives the OLS estimator for a regression through the origin:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_{WF} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\\Delta Y_i)(\\Delta S_i)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\\Delta S_i)^2}\n$$\nFinally, we express the estimator in terms of the original observable data $\\{Y_{i1}, Y_{i2}, S_{i1}, S_{i2}\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ by substituting back the definitions of $\\Delta Y_i$ and $\\Delta S_i$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_{WF} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (Y_{i2} - Y_{i1})(S_{i2} - S_{i1})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (S_{i2} - S_{i1})^2}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the within-family estimator for $\\beta$.\n\nFor this estimator, $\\hat{\\beta}_{WF}$, to consistently estimate the true causal parameter $\\beta$, a minimal set of identifying assumptions is required:\n\n1.  **Correct Model Specification**: The true relationship between birthweight, smoking, and the unobserved effects must be linear and additive as specified: $Y_{ij} = \\alpha_i + \\beta S_{ij} + u_{ij}$. The parameter $\\beta$ must be constant across individuals and time.\n\n2.  **Strict Exogeneity of the Idiosyncratic Error**: This is the crucial identifying assumption. It requires that the idiosyncratic error term $u_{ij}$ is uncorrelated with the explanatory variable $S_{ik}$ for *both* sibling pregnancies ($k=1,2$). Formally, this is expressed as $E[u_{ij} \\mid S_{i1}, S_{i2}, \\alpha_i] = 0$ for $j=1,2$. In the context of the differenced equation, $\\Delta Y_i = \\beta \\Delta S_i + \\Delta u_i$, this assumption ensures that the differenced regressor, $\\Delta S_i$, is uncorrelated with the differenced error term, $\\Delta u_i$. That is, $E[\\Delta u_i \\mid \\Delta S_i] = 0$, which is equivalent to $Cov(\\Delta S_i, \\Delta u_i) = 0$. This assumption would be violated if there were any unobserved *time-varying* (i.e., sibling-specific) factors that affect both the mother's change in smoking behavior and the child's birthweight. For example, a change in maternal stress or health status between pregnancies could affect both $S_{i2}$ and $u_{i2}$, inducing a spurious correlation and biasing the estimate of $\\beta$.\n\n3.  **Within-Family Variation**: For the estimator to be defined, the denominator must be non-zero. This requires that there is at least some variation in smoking habits between pregnancies across the sample. That is, $S_{i1} \\neq S_{i2}$ for at least one family $i$, such that $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (S_{i2} - S_{i1})^2 > 0$. If no mother changed her smoking habits, $\\beta$ would be unidentified by this method.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (Y_{i2} - Y_{i1})(S_{i2} - S_{i1})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (S_{i2} - S_{i1})^{2}}}\n$$", "id": "4607026"}, {"introduction": "In DOHaD research, the ideal exposure data from critical developmental windows is often unavailable, compelling researchers to use proxies such as birthweight.

Round your final numeric answer to three significant figures. The final answer must be the single numeric value of the difference only.", "solution": "Effect measure modification in linear regression with an interaction term arises when the expected change in the outcome with respect to an exposure depends on the level of another variable. In the given model,\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid B,G,S,M] \\;=\\; \\beta_{0} \\;+\\; \\beta_{B}\\,B \\;+\\; \\beta_{G}\\,G \\;+\\; \\beta_{BG}\\,B\\,G \\;+\\; \\gamma_{S}\\,S \\;+\\; \\gamma_{M}\\,M,\n$$\nthe interaction term $\\beta_{BG}\\,B\\,G$ allows the effect of $B$ on $Y$ to vary with $G$.\n\nBy definition in a linear model, the conditional effect of a one-unit increase in $B$ at a fixed gestational age $g$ is the partial derivative of the conditional expectation with respect to $B$ while holding $G=g$ (and other covariates fixed):\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial B}\\,\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid B,G,S,M] \\bigg|_{G=g} \\;=\\; \\beta_{B} \\;+\\; \\beta_{BG}\\,g.\n$$\nThis expression shows that the birthweight effect is modified by gestational age, with the modifier quantified by $\\beta_{BG}$.\n\nWe now compute the stratified effects at the specified gestational ages using the provided coefficients.\n\nAt $g=-3$ (which corresponds to $37$ weeks since $G$ is centered at $40$):\n$$\n\\text{Effect at }g=-3 \\;=\\; \\beta_{B} + \\beta_{BG}(-3) \\;=\\; (-0.36) + (-0.08)(-3) \\;=\\; -0.36 + 0.24 \\;=\\; -0.12.\n$$\nTherefore, at $37$ weeks, a $100$ gram increase in birthweight is associated with a change of $-0.12$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$ in systolic blood pressure.\n\nAt $g=1$ (which corresponds to $41$ weeks):\n$$\n\\text{Effect at }g=1 \\;=\\; \\beta_{B} + \\beta_{BG}(1) \\;=\\; (-0.36) + (-0.08)(1) \\;=\\; -0.36 - 0.08 \\;=\\; -0.44.\n$$\nTherefore, at $41$ weeks, a $100$ gram increase in birthweight is associated with a change of $-0.44$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$ in systolic blood pressure.\n\nThe effect measure modification by gestational age, defined here as the difference in the stratified effects (effect at $41$ weeks minus effect at $37$ weeks), is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\;=\\; \\left[\\,\\beta_{B} + \\beta_{BG}(1)\\,\\right] \\;-\\; \\left[\\,\\beta_{B} + \\beta_{BG}(-3)\\,\\right] \\;=\\; \\beta_{BG}\\,(1 - (-3)) \\;=\\; \\beta_{BG}\\,(4).\n$$\nSubstituting $\\beta_{BG} = -0.08$,\n$$\n\\Delta \\;=\\; (-0.08)\\times 4 \\;=\\; -0.32.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, the difference is $-0.320$.\n\nInterpretation: Because $\\Delta$ is negative, the inverse association between birthweight and systolic blood pressure is stronger at $41$ weeks than at $37$ weeks by $0.32$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$ per $100$ grams. This indicates effect measure modification by gestational age consistent with Developmental Origins of Health and Disease, where the impact of fetal growth on adult cardiovascular phenotypes varies across gestational timing.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.320}$$", "id": "4607085"}]}
