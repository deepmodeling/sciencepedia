The minor notational difference in the final interval being closed ($[5, 8]$) versus the others being half-open is inconsequential for Riemann integration, as the value of the integral is not affected by the function's value at a single endpoint.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts: first, a general derivation, and second, a specific numerical calculation.\n\n**Part 1: General Derivation**\n\nThe cumulative exposure $C$ over a total time $T$ is given by the integral of the concentration function $X(t)$:\n$$\nC = \\int_{0}^{T} X(t)\\,dt\n$$\nThe problem states that the time interval $[0, T]$ is partitioned into $n$ subintervals, $0 = t_{0} < t_{1} < \\dots < t_{n} = T$. The function $X(t)$ is piecewise constant, taking a value $x_{i}$ on each subinterval $[t_{i-1}, t_{i})$.\n\nUsing the additive property of Riemann integrals, we can break the total integral into a sum of integrals over each subinterval:\n$$\nC = \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{n}} X(t)\\,dt = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\int_{t_{i-1}}^{t_{i}} X(t)\\,dt\n$$\nWithin each subinterval $[t_{i-1}, t_{i}]$, the concentration is constant: $X(t) = x_{i}$. We can substitute this into the sum of integrals:\n$$\nC = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\int_{t_{i-1}}^{t_{i}} x_{i}\\,dt\n$$\nSince each $x_{i}$ is a constant with respect to the integration variable $t$, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$\nC = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} \\int_{t_{i-1}}^{t_{i}} 1\\,dt\n$$\nThe integral of the constant function $1$ over the interval $[t_{i-1}, t_{i}]$ is simply the length of the interval:\n$$\n\\int_{t_{i-1}}^{t_{i}} 1\\,dt = [t]_{t_{i-1}}^{t_{i}} = t_{i} - t_{i-1}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $C$ yields the general formula for cumulative exposure with a piecewise-constant concentration profile:\n$$\nC = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} (t_{i} - t_{i-1})\n$$\nThis derived expression shows that the cumulative exposure is the summation of the products of the concentration in each interval and the duration of that interval.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation**\n\nNow, we apply this formula to the specific data provided. The monitoring period has $n=3$ intervals over a total time $T=8$ hours.\n\nThe partition points are $t_{0} = 0$, $t_{1} = 3$, $t_{2} = 5$, and $t_{3} = 8$ hours.\nThe corresponding concentrations are:\n- $x_{1} = 0.12 \\, \\mathrm{mg/m^3}$ for the interval with duration $t_{1} - t_{0} = 3 - 0 = 3$ hours.\n- $x_{2} = 0.40 \\, \\mathrm{mg/m^3}$ for the interval with duration $t_{2} - t_{1} = 5 - 3 = 2$ hours.\n- $x_{3} = 0.15 \\, \\mathrm{mg/m^3}$ for the interval with duration $t_{3} - t_{2} = 8 - 5 = 3$ hours.\n\nUsing the derived summation formula for $C$ with $n=3$:\n$$\nC = x_{1}(t_{1} - t_{0}) + x_{2}(t_{2} - t_{1}) + x_{3}(t_{3} - t_{2})\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nC = (0.12 \\, \\mathrm{mg/m^3})(3 \\, \\mathrm{h}) + (0.40 \\, \\mathrm{mg/m^3})(2 \\, \\mathrm{h}) + (0.15 \\, \\mathrm{mg/m^3})(3 \\, \\mathrm{h})\n$$\nWe calculate each term individually:\n- Term 1: $0.12 \\times 3 = 0.36 \\, \\mathrm{mg \\cdot h / m^3}$\n- Term 2: $0.40 \\times 2 = 0.80 \\, \\mathrm{mg \\cdot h / m^3}$\n- Term 3: $0.15 \\times 3 = 0.45 \\, \\mathrm{mg \\cdot h / m^3}$\n\nSumming the terms gives the total cumulative exposure:\n$$\nC = 0.36 + 0.80 + 0.45 = 1.61 \\, \\mathrm{mg \\cdot h / m^3}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $1.61$ has three significant figures. To express this value with four significant figures, we append a zero, which is significant in this context.\n$$\nC = 1.610 \\, \\mathrm{mg \\cdot h / m^3}\n$$\nThis is the final numerical value for the cumulative exposure.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.610}\n$$", "id": "4593574"}, {"introduction": "The concentration of a substance in the environment is only part of the story; what truly matters for health is the amount that gets inside the body.

The derivation will be based on the fundamental principle of mass balance for a one-compartment toxicokinetic model.\n\nThe mass balance principle states that the rate of change of the internal body burden, which we denote as $M(t)$, is equal to the rate of inflow of the substance minus the rate of outflow. This can be written as a differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = \\text{Rate of Inflow} - \\text{Rate of Outflow}\n$$\nFirst, we define the terms for inflow and outflow based on the problem statement.\n\nThe rate of inflow is the mass of the contaminant entering the systemic circulation per unit time. The external exposure occurs at a constant rate $X_{0}$ (mass/time). A fraction $f$ of this external exposure is absorbed. Therefore, the rate of inflow into the compartment is the product of the absorbed fraction and the external exposure rate:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Inflow} = f X_{0}\n$$\nThe absorbed fraction $f$ is a dimensionless quantity, with $0 < f \\leq 1$.\n\nThe rate of outflow is due to elimination from the compartment, which is a first-order process. In a first-order process, the rate of elimination is directly proportional to the amount of substance currently in the compartment, $M(t)$. The constant of proportionality is the first-order elimination rate constant, $k$, which has units of inverse time (e.g., $\\text{day}^{-1}$). The rate of outflow is therefore:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Outflow} = k M(t)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the rates of inflow and outflow into the mass balance equation, we obtain the governing first-order linear ordinary differential equation for the system:\n$$\n\\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = f X_{0} - k M(t)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the steady-state condition. At steady state, the system is in equilibrium, and the internal body burden no longer changes with time. This implies that the rate of change of $M(t)$ is zero. Let $M_{\\text{ss}}$ be the constant body burden at steady state. The steady-state condition is mathematically expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = 0\n$$\nApplying this condition to our differential equation, we have:\n$$\n0 = f X_{0} - k M_{\\text{ss}}\n$$\nWe can now solve this algebraic equation for $M_{\\text{ss}}$.

The ED50 is a common metric of potency. A compound with a lower ED50 is considered more potent because a smaller dose is needed to cause the defined effect in $50\\%$ of the population.\nThe dose-response model can be expressed in terms of the ED50. We found that at the ED50, $\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)=0$, which implies $0 = \\alpha + \\beta \\ln(\\text{ED50})$. This gives $\\alpha = -\\beta \\ln(\\text{ED50})$.

The response is driven by the ratio of the dose to the ED50.\nNow, consider two compounds, Compound $A$ and Compound $B$, at a common dose $d_c$. Let their potencies be characterized by $\\text{ED50}_A$ and $\\text{ED50}_B$, respectively. Assume Compound $A$ is more potent than Compound $B$, which means $\\text{ED50}_A < \\text{ED50}_B$.\nFor simplicity, assume they have the same dose-response slope $\\beta > 0$. At the common dose $d_c$, we have the following ratios:\n$$ \\frac{d_c}{\\text{ED50}_A} > \\frac{d_c}{\\text{ED50}_B} $$\nSince $\\beta > 0$ and the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function, this implies:\n$$ \\beta \\ln\\left(\\frac{d_c}{\\text{ED50}_A}\\right) > \\beta \\ln\\left(\\frac{d_c}{\\text{ED50}_B}\\right) $$\nThis is equivalent to:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_A}{1-p_A}\\right) > \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_B}{1-p_B}\\right) $$\nwhere $p_A$ and $p_B$ are the risks associated with dose $d_c$ of each compound.\nSince the logistic function $f(x) = \\frac{\\exp(x)}{1+\\exp(x)}$ (which maps log-odds to probability) is also monotonically increasing, a larger log-odds value corresponds to a higher probability. Therefore:\n$$ p_A > p_B $$\nThis demonstrates that at any common dose $d_c$, the more potent compound (the one with the lower ED50) will confer a higher risk of the adverse effect. In exposure assessment, knowing the ED50 allows for a direct comparison of the relative hazard of different substances. A substance with a very low ED50 is of greater concern and would require more stringent exposure limits (e.g., lower Occupational Exposure Limits, OELs) compared to a substance with a much higher ED50 for the same health endpoint.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.000}$$", "id": "4593517"}]}
