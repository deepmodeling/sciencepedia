All necessary information is provided for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected change in the number of cases per $100{,}000$ persons following a reduction in an environmental exposure. This can be calculated using the provided exposure-response relationship and baseline incidence rate.\n\nFirst, we formalize the log-linear exposure-response relationship. Let $R$ be the risk of the health outcome and $E$ be the exposure concentration. The relationship states that the change in the natural logarithm of risk is proportional to the change in exposure. If $R_0$ is the risk at baseline exposure $E_0$, and $R_1$ is the risk at the new exposure level $E_1$, this relationship is expressed as:\n$$\n\\ln(R_1) - \\ln(R_0) = \\beta (E_1 - E_0)\n$$\nwhere $\\beta$ is the exposure-response coefficient. Using the properties of logarithms, this can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_0}\\right) = \\beta \\Delta E\n$$\nHere, $\\Delta E = E_1 - E_0$ is the change in exposure. The ratio $\\frac{R_1}{R_0}$ is defined as the relative risk ($RR$). Therefore, we can write:\n$$\n\\ln(RR) = \\beta \\Delta E\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the formula for the relative risk:\n$$\nRR = \\exp(\\beta \\Delta E)\n$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- The change in exposure: $\\Delta E = -10$ $\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{m}^{3}$.\n- The exposure-response coefficient: $\\beta = 0.005$ per $\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{m}^{3}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for relative risk:\n$$\nRR = \\exp(0.005 \\times (-10)) = \\exp(-0.05)\n$$\nThe problem states that the outcome is rare, which allows us to approximate risk ($R$) with incidence ($I$). Thus, the relative risk can be approximated by the ratio of incidences:\n$$\nRR = \\frac{R_1}{R_0} \\approx \\frac{I_1}{I_0}\n$$\nwhere $I_0$ is the baseline incidence and $I_1$ is the new incidence after the exposure change.

We can rearrange the equation for the risk ratio to express $p_1$ in terms of $RR$ and $p_0$:\n$$p_1 = RR \\cdot p_0$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $p_1$ into the equation for the risk difference:\n$$RD = (RR \\cdot p_0) - p_0$$\n\nFactoring out the common term $p_0$ yields the general expression for the risk difference:\n$$RD = p_0 (RR - 1)$$\nThis expression represents the excess risk attributable to the exposure for any given individual in the exposed population.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Excess Hospitalizations**\n\nThe expected number of excess hospitalizations in the exposed population, which we denote as $N_{excess}$, is the total burden of disease attributable to the exposure within that population. It is calculated by multiplying the excess risk per individual ($RD$) by the total number of individuals in the exposed population ($N_E$).\n$$N_{excess} = RD \\cdot N_E$$\n\nUsing the expression for $RD$ derived in Part 1, we have:\n$$N_{excess} = p_0 (RR - 1) N_E$$\n\nWe are given the following values for the scenario:\n- $p_0 = 0.0075$\n- $RR = 1.42$\n- $N_E = 2.75 \\times 10^5$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $N_{excess}$:\n$$N_{excess} = 0.0075 \\cdot (1.42 - 1) \\cdot (2.75 \\times 10^5)$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the term in the parentheses:\n$$1.42 - 1 = 0.42$$\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n$$N_{excess} = 0.0075 \\cdot 0.42 \\cdot (2.75 \\times 10^5)$$\n\nNext, we calculate the product of the risk terms, which is the risk difference $RD$:\n$$RD = 0.0075 \\cdot 0.42 = 0.00315$$\n\nFinally, we multiply the risk difference by the exposed population size:\n$$N_{excess} = 0.00315 \\cdot (2.75 \\times 10^5)$$\n$$N_{excess} = 866.25$$\n\nThe problem requires the final numerical result to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $866.25$ has five significant figures. Rounding this to four significant figures gives:\n$$N_{excess} \\approx 866.3$$\n\nThis result represents the expected number of excess cardiorespiratory hospitalizations per year in the exposed population that are attributable to wildfire smoke exposure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{866.3}$$", "id": "4596196"}, {"introduction": "Real-world biological systems rarely respond in a simple, linear fashion. This exercise explores the crucial concept of a saturating dose-response relationship, where the health risk ceases to increase beyond a certain exposure threshold.

Because $\\text{RR}(x)$ is flat for $x \\ge x^*$, a small uniform reduction that keeps $x_H' \\ge x^*$ yields zero marginal benefit for the high-exposure subgroup.

It accurately states that the low-exposure subgroup benefits because their exposure change occurs on the increasing part of the dose-response curve. The provided formula, $I_0 N_L\\big[\\exp(\\beta x_L)-\\exp(\\beta (x_L-d))\\big]$, is the correct expression for $\\Delta C_L$. The numerical value of $\\approx 13.2$ cases and the $0$ benefit from the high-exposure subgroup match my derivation. Since $\\Delta C_H = 0$, the total benefit is indeed equal to the benefit from the low-exposure group.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Marginal benefits are proportional to $\\beta$ in all subgroups regardless of saturation, so both subgroups benefit. Approximating prevented cases with a first-order change $I_0 \\beta \\exp(\\beta x)\\,d$ for each subgroup gives a total of approximately $33.6$ prevented cases per year.**\n-   **Analysis**: The core premise that benefits accrue \"regardless of saturation\" directly contradicts the problem's dose-response model. The marginal benefit depends on the derivative of the risk function, which is $0$ in the saturation region. Therefore, it is incorrect to state that both subgroups benefit. The calculation, while arithmetically consistent with the false premise of ignoring saturation, leads to an incorrect total.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The high-exposure subgroup yields the largest marginal benefit because its relative risk is higher, so even small reductions yield the largest prevented cases there; the total prevented cases are approximately $30.0$ per year, with most from the high-exposure subgroup.**\n-   **Analysis**: This statement relies on a flawed intuition. While the high-exposure subgroup has a higher absolute risk, the *marginal benefit* of a small exposure reduction depends on the *slope* of the dose-response curve at that exposure level. Because the curve is flat for this subgroup (slope of $0$), the marginal benefit is $0$. This is a counter-intuitive but critical result of a saturating dose-response model. The quantitative claims are also incorrect.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Because $\\text{RR}(x)$ plateaus beyond $x^*$, no subgroup benefits from small reductions; the total prevented cases are $0.0$ per year.**\n-   **Analysis**: This option correctly identifies the plateau effect but incorrectly generalizes its consequence to all subgroups. The low-exposure subgroup, with initial exposure $x_L = 30$, is well below the saturation threshold of $x^* = 50$. Therefore, this subgroup does benefit from the exposure reduction, and the total number of prevented cases is non-zero.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4596167"}]}
