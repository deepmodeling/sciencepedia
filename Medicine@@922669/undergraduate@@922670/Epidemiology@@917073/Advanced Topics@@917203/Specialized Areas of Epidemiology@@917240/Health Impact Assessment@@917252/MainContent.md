## Introduction
Decisions made in sectors like transportation, housing, and energy have profound, yet often unexamined, consequences for public health. Without a formal process to evaluate these effects, policies can inadvertently create or worsen health disparities, disproportionately harming vulnerable communities. Health Impact Assessment (HIA) emerges as the critical solution to this gap, offering a systematic framework to predict the health and equity implications of a proposal *before* it is enacted. This article provides a comprehensive guide to the theory and practice of HIA. The journey begins with **Principles and Mechanisms**, where we will define HIA, explore its ethical foundations in health equity, and dissect the rigorous causal and quantitative logic that forms its analytical core. Following this, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** will demonstrate how these principles are applied in real-world scenarios, bridging the gap between scientific evidence from fields like economics and [environmental science](@entry_id:187998) and complex policy decisions. Finally, **Hands-On Practices** will allow you to apply these concepts, translating theoretical knowledge into practical skills for conducting fundamental HIA calculations. This structured approach will equip you with a robust understanding of HIA as an indispensable tool for building healthier and more equitable societies.

## Principles and Mechanisms

### Defining Health Impact Assessment in the Landscape of Public Health Analysis

Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is a systematic process that uses an array of data sources and analytic methods and considers input from stakeholders to determine the potential effects of a proposed policy, plan, program, or project on the health of a population and the distribution of those effects within the population. HIA provides evidence-based recommendations to inform decision-making, seeking to maximize positive health effects and minimize negative ones. As a field of practice, it is essential to distinguish HIA from other forms of public health and policy analysis, as each serves a distinct purpose and operates at a different stage of the decision-making process.

To formalize these distinctions, we can characterize each analytic approach along three dimensions: the timing of the analysis relative to a decision, the core counterfactual question it seeks to answer, and the scope of its inquiry [@problem_id:4596170].

*   **Health Impact Assessment (HIA)** is fundamentally **prospective**. It is conducted *before* a decision is made to inform the choice between alternatives. Its central counterfactual question is: "What will be the health consequences for the population if we adopt this proposal, compared to the consequences if we do not (the status quo) or if we adopt an alternative proposal?" Formally, it aims to estimate the difference in population health states under these competing futures. The scope of an HIA is characteristically **broad and systemic**. It moves beyond direct clinical outcomes to examine the complex causal pathways through **social, economic, and environmental determinants of health**. A hallmark of HIA is its explicit focus on **health equity**, analyzing how impacts may be distributed across different socioeconomic, racial, ethnic, or geographic subgroups.

*   **Regulatory Risk Assessment** is also typically prospective but serves a much narrower function. It is used to set standards for specific hazards (e.g., an acceptable level of a chemical in drinking water) or to assess compliance with existing regulations. Its counterfactual orientation is a contrast between the health risk under a specified level of exposure to a hazard versus a reference level, often zero exposure or a level deemed to pose minimal risk. The scope is **narrow and mechanistic**, focusing on hazard-specific health endpoints linked by a well-defined exposure-dose-response pathway. It does not typically address the broad social determinants of health that are central to HIA.

*   **Program Evaluation** is primarily **retrospective or concurrent** with an intervention. It is conducted *after* a program has been implemented to answer the questions, "Did it work?" (summative evaluation) or "Is it working as intended?" (formative evaluation). Its classic counterfactual contrast is between outcomes for those who participated in the program versus those who did not, or a comparison of outcomes before and after the program's implementation. Its scope is generally confined to the program's stated goals and "theory of change," with less emphasis on the wider web of health determinants.

*   **Health Technology Assessment (HTA)** is a prospective tool used to inform decisions about the adoption and coverage of new health technologies, such as pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Its counterfactual is a comparison of the new technology against the current "standard of care" or a placebo. The scope of HTA centers on **clinical effectiveness, patient safety, and economic outcomes** like cost-effectiveness. While ethical implications may be considered, HTA does not typically engage with the broad environmental and social determinants of health that are the primary domain of HIA.

In essence, HIA is the tool of choice when decision-makers need a forward-looking, comprehensive, and equity-focused analysis of a proposal outside of the traditional health sector, such as an urban planning, transportation, or energy policy [@problem_id:4596170].

### The Ethical Foundations and the Primacy of Equity

HIA is not a value-neutral technical exercise; it is grounded in a firm ethical framework that prioritizes human well-being and social justice. The core principles guiding HIA practice are derived from the foundations of public health ethics: **beneficence**, **justice**, and **autonomy** [@problem_id:4596177].

*   **Beneficence** compels us to act in ways that promote the welfare of others. In HIA, this translates to designing policies that maximize health benefits and minimize harms, striving for a net positive impact on population health.

*   **Justice** demands the fair distribution of benefits and burdens. It directs our attention to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, requiring us to prevent the imposition of disproportionate harms upon them. This principle is the engine behind HIA's focus on health equity.

*   **Autonomy** requires respect for persons, which in the context of public policy, is expressed through the right to informed and meaningful participation in decisions that affect one's health and community.

A critical distinction within the principle of justice is that between **equality** and **equity**. **Equality** refers to sameness—giving everyone the same thing or treating them in the same way. **Equity**, in contrast, is about fairness. It recognizes that different groups may have different needs and historical disadvantages, and that achieving a just outcome may require an unequal distribution of resources or benefits to correct for these underlying disparities. The goal of health equity is to ensure that all people have a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible [@problem_id:4596157].

Because of this ethical commitment, **distributional analysis** is an integral and non-negotiable component of HIA. A simple aggregate measure of health impact, like the average number of deaths averted across a whole city, can be dangerously misleading. It might conceal a scenario where a policy generates large benefits for affluent, healthy communities while simultaneously causing harm to a low-income, vulnerable community. Such an outcome would increase health inequities, even if the net effect appears positive.

Consider a freight traffic rerouting policy that produces a net benefit of 80 averted Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) for a city. If this policy achieves its net gain by averting 120 DALYs in wealthier neighborhoods while adding a burden of 40 DALYs to a disadvantaged, low-income corridor, it poses a severe conflict between beneficence (the net gain) and justice (the unfair distribution of harm). A sound HIA process would not simply recommend the policy based on its net benefit. Instead, guided by the principles of justice and autonomy, it would strongly advocate for mitigation measures (e.g., roadside barriers, air filtration subsidies) that reduce the harm to the vulnerable group and insist on a robust engagement process with the affected community, even if the net benefit remains the same. This approach prioritizes reducing concentrated harm and respecting affected persons over a simplistic utilitarian calculation [@problem_id:4596177].

This commitment to equity can also be formalized quantitatively. For instance, in an HIA of a clean air regulation, one might calculate the absolute reduction in asthma incidence for different socio-economic status (SES) groups. Due to higher baseline disease rates, a uniform reduction in air pollution will often produce a larger absolute health gain for lower-SES groups. To formalize a preference for this outcome, an HIA could apply **equity weights**, giving greater mathematical weight to health gains experienced by the more disadvantaged group when calculating a summary measure of the policy's benefit. This makes the ethical preference for reducing health disparities explicit in the final analysis [@problem_id:4596157].

### The Causal Logic of Health Impact Assessment

At its core, an HIA is an exercise in applied causal inference. It seeks to estimate the causal effect of a policy on health outcomes. To do this rigorously, we rely on formal frameworks developed in epidemiology and related disciplines.

#### The Potential Outcomes Framework

The conceptual bedrock for defining a causal effect is the **potential outcomes framework**. Imagine a policy to install air purifiers in schools to reduce asthma exacerbations. For any given student, there are two potential outcomes: their health status (e.g., having an asthma attack or not) if their school gets the purifiers, and their health status if their school does not. We can denote these as $Y(1)$ and $Y(0)$, respectively. The causal effect for that individual student is the difference, $Y(1) - Y(0)$. However, we can never observe both potential outcomes for the same student at the same time—this is the "fundamental problem of causal inference."

Since we cannot measure individual causal effects, HIA focuses on the **Average Causal Effect (ACE)** for the population, defined as $E[Y(1) - Y(0)]$. This represents the average difference in health if the entire population were exposed to the policy versus if no one were. To estimate this unobservable quantity, we must use observable data. In a randomized study, where the policy is randomly assigned, the groups receiving and not receiving the policy are, on average, exchangeable. This allows us to use the observed difference in average outcomes, $E[Y|A=1] - E[Y|A=0]$, as an unbiased estimate of the ACE. This identification relies on several key assumptions: consistency (the observed outcome corresponds to the potential outcome), positivity (everyone has a non-zero chance of being in either group), and no interference (one person's outcome is not affected by another's treatment) [@problem_id:4596230].

#### Causal Structure and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)

In most HIA settings, we do not have the luxury of a randomized trial. We must estimate effects from observational data, where the policy is not assigned at random. To navigate the complexities of non-randomized data, we use **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)** to visually represent our causal assumptions about the relationships between variables. A DAG consists of nodes (variables) and arrows (direct causal effects), with the rule that there are no directed cycles (a path of arrows cannot lead from a variable back to itself).

DAGs provide a [formal grammar](@entry_id:273416) for understanding and mitigating bias. The three most important structures to recognize are confounding, mediation, and collision [@problem_id:4596221].

*   **Confounding**: A confounder is a variable that is a common cause of both the policy (or exposure) and the health outcome. For example, in a DAG for a new air quality policy ($P$) and asthma ($Y$), neighborhood industrial density ($I$) might be a confounder if industrial areas are both more likely to receive the policy and have higher baseline rates of asthma ($I \to P$ and $I \to Y$). This creates a non-causal "backdoor path" ($P \leftarrow I \to A \to Y$, where A is air quality) between $P$ and $Y$. To estimate the causal effect of $P$ on $Y$, we must block this path by adjusting for the confounder $I$ in our analysis.

*   **Mediation**: A mediator is a variable that lies on the causal pathway between the policy and the outcome. In the air quality example, the policy ($P$) affects asthma ($Y$) by reducing air pollution ($A$). Thus, the causal path is $P \to A \to Y$. The variable $A$ is a mediator. If we want to estimate the *total* effect of the policy, we must *not* adjust for the mediator $A$, as doing so would block the very causal effect we want to measure. Adjusting for a mediator allows us to estimate a *direct effect*, but not the total effect.

*   **Collider-Stratification Bias**: A collider is a variable that is a common *effect* of two other variables. For example, if a policy ($P$) increases inspections, affecting a compliance index ($C$), and an industry's underlying compliance culture ($B$) also affects that index, we have the structure $P \to C \leftarrow B$. On its own, the collider $C$ blocks the path between $P$ and $B$. However, a crucial rule of DAGs is that *conditioning* on a collider opens the path. If we were to adjust for $C$ in our analysis, we would induce a spurious association between $P$ and $B$, potentially biasing our estimate of the effect of $P$ on $Y$ if $B$ also affects $Y$. A particularly insidious form of this is **selection bias**. For instance, if we only use hospital admissions data for our study, we are conditioning on being admitted to the hospital ($S=1$). If both the health outcome of interest ($Y$) and factors related to the policy ($E \to H$) affect hospital admission ($H \to S \leftarrow Y$), then conditioning on $S$ acts like conditioning on a [collider](@entry_id:192770), creating a spurious pathway between the policy and the outcome that can severely bias the results [@problem_id:4596198].

By mapping our assumptions in a DAG, we can use a set of rules known as [d-separation](@entry_id:748152) and the "[backdoor criterion](@entry_id:637856)" to identify a sufficient set of variables to adjust for to obtain an unbiased estimate of the total causal effect [@problem_id:4596198] [@problem_id:4596221].

### The Quantitative Assessment Framework

The causal logic of HIA can be translated into a quantitative sequence, often conceptualized as a chain of functions: **Policy $\to$ Exposure $\to$ Response $\to$ Health Outcome**. For this chain to be internally consistent and produce a valid estimate, each link must satisfy specific mathematical properties [@problem_id:4596213].

Let's consider a policy $P$ that affects a population of size $N$.
1.  **Policy to Exposure ($P \to E$)**: The first step is to model how the policy $P$ alters the distribution of exposures and other relevant covariates ($Z$) in the population. This is formally represented as a probability measure, $F_{E,Z|P}$, which describes the [joint distribution](@entry_id:204390) of exposure and covariates that results from implementing policy $P$.

2.  **Exposure to Response ($E \to R$)**: The second step links exposure to individual health risk. For each individual, their risk of a health outcome, $r$, is a function of their specific exposure level $e$ and their covariates $z$. This risk, $r(e,z)$, is a probability, meaning it must be a [measurable function](@entry_id:141135) that maps to the interval $[0, 1]$. This function is the **exposure-[response function](@entry_id:138845)** (or concentration-[response function](@entry_id:138845)). In practice, this function is rarely known perfectly. It is typically derived from the existing body of epidemiological literature. A common functional form for many environmental exposures is the log-linear model:
    $$ RR(\Delta E) = \exp(\beta \cdot \Delta E) $$
    where $RR$ is the relative risk associated with a change in exposure $\Delta E$, and $\beta$ is the slope parameter. The value of $\beta$ is often estimated via a **meta-analysis** of published studies. This involves extracting log-relative risks (e.g., $\ln(\text{Hazard Ratio})$) and their standard errors from multiple studies, and pooling them using inverse-variance weighting to produce a single, more precise estimate of the exposure-response relationship. This process allows HIA to be built upon a foundation of synthesized scientific evidence [@problem_id:4596201].

3.  **Response to Health Outcome ($R \to H$)**: The final step is to aggregate individual risks to the population level to estimate the total health impact, $H(P)$. This is achieved by applying the law of total expectation. The total expected number of cases in the population is the population size $N$ multiplied by the average individual risk. This average is calculated by integrating the individual [risk function](@entry_id:166593) $r(e,z)$ over the entire population distribution of exposures and covariates under policy $P$:
    $$ H(P) = N \int r(e,z) \, dF_{E,Z|P}(e,z) $$
    The overall impact of the policy is then the difference $\Delta H = H(P_{\text{proposal}}) - H(P_{\text{status quo}})$. This formulation is powerful because it is non-parametric; it does not require assumptions about specific distributional families and provides a rigorous foundation for quantitative HIA [@problem_id:4596213].

### Characterizing Uncertainty

Every step in the quantitative HIA framework is subject to uncertainty. A credible assessment must not only produce a [point estimate](@entry_id:176325) of the health impact but also characterize the uncertainty surrounding that estimate. It is critical to distinguish between two fundamental types of uncertainty: epistemic and aleatory [@problem_id:4596218].

*   **Epistemic uncertainty** is uncertainty due to a **lack of knowledge**. It is potentially reducible with more data or better models. Sources include uncertainty in the true value of the exposure-response coefficient ($\beta$), measurement error in exposure data, or misspecification of the causal model. In our formal framework $H=f(\theta, V)$, epistemic uncertainty relates to the parameters $\theta$. It is often represented by a probability distribution over the possible true values of a parameter (e.g., a posterior distribution for $\beta$ from a meta-analysis).

*   **Aleatory uncertainty** is uncertainty due to **inherent variability** or randomness in a system. It is considered irreducible. Even if we knew all model parameters with perfect certainty, this variability would remain. It reflects genuine heterogeneity in the world, such as person-to-person differences in exposure, behavior, and susceptibility. In our framework, [aleatory uncertainty](@entry_id:154011) relates to the variability of the quantities $V$. It is represented by the distribution of these variables across the population (e.g., $p(V | \theta)$).

Distinguishing these two is vital for decision-making. If uncertainty in an HIA is primarily epistemic, the appropriate response might be to delay a decision and conduct further research to reduce it. If the uncertainty is primarily aleatory, more research won't eliminate it, and the decision must be made by considering the full range of possible outcomes for different people.

The standard method for propagating these distinct uncertainties is a **two-dimensional Monte Carlo (2DMC) simulation**. This involves a nested loop structure:
1.  **Outer Loop (Epistemic)**: Sample a plausible set of parameters $\theta^{(m)}$ from their probability distributions. This represents one "possible state of the world."
2.  **Inner Loop (Aleatory)**: For that set of parameters, simulate the population variability by drawing many samples $V^{(n)}$ from their distributions. Run the HIA model for each draw to generate a distribution of health outcomes that reflects population heterogeneity under that one "state of the world."

By repeating this process for many draws from the outer loop, we generate a distribution of distributions, which allows us to clearly separate the impact of our lack of knowledge from the impact of inherent population variability on the final results [@problem_id:4596218].

### The HIA Process in Practice: Screening and Scoping

While the quantitative and causal frameworks provide the engine for HIA, the practical process follows a series of structured stages. Two of the most critical initial stages are **screening** and **scoping** [@problem_id:4596191].

**Screening** is the first step: a rapid, preliminary assessment to determine *if* a full HIA is warranted for a given proposal. The goal is to efficiently filter proposals to focus on those with the most significant potential health implications. The decision to proceed is typically based on several criteria:
*   **Magnitude and Likelihood**: Is the proposal likely to affect a large number of people, and are the potential health changes non-trivial? This can involve "back-of-the-envelope" calculations, such as estimating the expected number of avoided deaths from a congestion pricing policy based on predicted air quality improvements [@problem_id:4596191].
*   **Equity Relevance**: Is the proposal likely to affect vulnerable or disadvantaged groups, or to alter the distribution of health in the population?
*   **Feasibility and Timeliness**: Are there sufficient resources, data, and expertise to conduct a meaningful HIA within the decision-making timeline? An HIA is only useful if its findings can inform the decision before it is made.

If the screening process concludes that an HIA is needed, the project moves to the **scoping** phase. Scoping sets the boundaries for the assessment. It is a planning stage that defines what the HIA will cover and how it will be conducted. Key tasks in scoping include:
*   Identifying the key causal pathways linking the proposal to health outcomes.
*   Selecting the specific health outcomes and population subgroups to be prioritized.
*   Determining the appropriate analytic methods and data sources to be used in the assessment phase.
*   Developing a plan for stakeholder participation.

In short, screening asks "Should we do an HIA?" while scoping asks "If so, what will this HIA look like?" This structured approach ensures that HIA is applied efficiently, effectively, and in a manner that is responsive to both the scientific evidence and the decision-making context.
