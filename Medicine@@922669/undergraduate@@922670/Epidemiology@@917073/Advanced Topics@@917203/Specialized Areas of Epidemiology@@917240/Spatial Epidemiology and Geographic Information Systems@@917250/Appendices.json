A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is determined by executing the three tasks specified in the problem statement.\n\n**1. Computation of Euclidean Distance ($d_{\\text{Euclid}}$)**\nThe straight-line or Euclidean distance between two points in a Cartesian plane is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. Let the coordinates of point $S$ be $(x_S, y_S) = (0, 0)$ and the coordinates of point $T$ be $(x_T, y_T) = (900, 400)$. The distance $d_{\\text{Euclid}}$ is given by the formula:\n$$d_{\\text{Euclid}} = \\sqrt{(x_T - x_S)^2 + (y_T - y_S)^2}$$\nSubstituting the given coordinates:\n$$d_{\\text{Euclid}} = \\sqrt{(900 - 0)^2 + (400 - 0)^2}$$\n$$d_{\\text{Euclid}} = \\sqrt{900^2 + 400^2}$$\n$$d_{\\text{Euclid}} = \\sqrt{810000 + 160000}$$\n$$d_{\\text{Euclid}} = \\sqrt{970000}$$\nThis can be simplified to:\n$$d_{\\text{Euclid}} = \\sqrt{97 \\times 10000} = 100\\sqrt{97}$$\nThe units of this distance are meters.\n\n**2. Computation of Shortest-Path Network Distance ($d_{\\text{network}}$)**\nThe problem states that the only traversable streets form a single path from $S$ to $T$. This path is $S \\leftrightarrow I_{1} \\leftrightarrow I_{2} \\leftrightarrow I_{3} \\leftrightarrow I_{4} \\leftrightarrow T$. Since this is the only path provided, it is, by definition, the shortest path on the specified network. The network distance, $d_{\\text{network}}$, is the sum of the lengths (weights) of the edges constituting this path.\n$$d_{\\text{network}} = d(S, I_{1}) + d(I_{1}, I_{2}) + d(I_{2}, I_{3}) + d(I_{3}, I_{4}) + d(I_{4}, T)$$\nSubstituting the given lengths:\n$$d_{\\text{network}} = 300 + 500 + 300 + 400 + 200$$\n$$d_{\\text{network}} = 1700$$\nThe units of this distance are also meters.\n\n**3. Computation of the Excess Ratio ($D$)**\nThe relative discrepancy is quantified by the excess ratio $D$, defined as:\n$$D = \\frac{d_{\\text{network}} - d_{\\text{Euclid}}}{d_{\\text{Euclid}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $d_{\\text{network}}$ and $d_{\\text{Euclid}}$:\n$$D = \\frac{1700 - 100\\sqrt{97}}{100\\sqrt{97}}$$\nThis expression can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by $100$:\n$$D = \\frac{17 - \\sqrt{97}}{\\sqrt{97}} = \\frac{17}{\\sqrt{97}} - 1$$\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we compute the value of this expression.\nFirst, we approximate $\\sqrt{97}$:\n$$\\sqrt{97} \\approx 9.8488578$$\nNow, we calculate $D$:\n$$D \\approx \\frac{17}{9.8488578} - 1$$\n$$D \\approx 1.7260846 - 1$$\n$$D \\approx 0.7260846$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $7, 2, 6, 0$. The fifth significant figure is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$D \\approx 0.7261$$\nThis value represents the fractional increase of the network distance over the straight-line distance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7261}$$", "id": "4637659"}, {"introduction": "After establishing how to measure distance, a common task in analyzing point data—such as the locations of patient homes—is to formally define which locations are \"neighbors.\" This practice introduces the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) method, a fundamental technique for defining spatial relationships based on proximity [@problem_id:4637652].

Cases located near the boundary of a finite study region (e.g., case 1 at $(1.0, 1.0)$ and case 8 at $(9.1, 6.8)$ in the region $[0,10]\\times[0,7]$) have a restricted set of observable neighbors. Their true nearest neighbors might lie outside the study area, but these are unobserved and thus excluded from the analysis. This phenomenon is known as a boundary or edge effect. Consequently, for a near-boundary case, the k-NN algorithm is forced to select neighbors from the remaining cases within the region, which may be farther away than the unobserved neighbors. This can lead to artificially inflated nearest-neighbor distances and potentially skewed or less connected graph structures near the borders. It represents a form of data censoring that can bias estimates of spatial clustering and other spatial statistics. In this problem, case 8 is an example; its nearest neighbors $\\{5,6,7\\}$ are relatively distant, a situation that might be altered if cases outside the $[0,10]\\times[0,7]$ rectangle were included.\n\nThe final answer required is the total number of unique undirected edges.

The weights matrix is:\n$$ W = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\frac{1}{3}  \\frac{1}{3}  \\frac{1}{3} \\\\ \\frac{1}{3}  0  \\frac{1}{3}  \\frac{1}{3} \\\\ \\frac{1}{3}  \\frac{1}{3}  0  \\frac{1}{3} \\\\ \\frac{1}{3}  \\frac{1}{3}  \\frac{1}{3}  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe expand the double summation:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n w_{ij} z_i z_j = \\sum_{i=1}^n z_i \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^n w_{ij} z_j \\right)$\n\nFor $i=1$: $z_1(w_{11}z_1 + w_{12}z_2 + w_{13}z_3 + w_{14}z_4) = (-10) \\left( 0 \\cdot (-10) + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (-8) + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (10) + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (8) \\right) = (-10) \\frac{-8+10+8}{3} = (-10) \\frac{10}{3} = -\\frac{100}{3}$.\n\nFor $i=2$: $z_2(w_{21}z_1 + w_{22}z_2 + w_{23}z_3 + w_{24}z_4) = (-8) \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (-10) + 0 \\cdot (-8) + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (10) + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (8) \\right) = (-8) \\frac{-10+10+8}{3} = (-8) \\frac{8}{3} = -\\frac{64}{3}$.\n\nFor $i=3$: $z_3(w_{31}z_1 + w_{32}z_2 + w_{33}z_3 + w_{34}z_4) = (10) \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (-10) + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (-8) + 0 \\cdot (10) + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (8) \\right) = (10) \\frac{-10-8+8}{3} = (10) \\frac{-10}{3} = -\\frac{100}{3}$.\n\nFor $i=4$: $z_4(w_{41}z_1 + w_{42}z_2 + w_{43}z_3 + w_{44}z_4) = (8) \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (-10) + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (-8) + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (10) + 0 \\cdot (8) \\right) = (8) \\frac{-10-8+10}{3} = (8) \\frac{-8}{3} = -\\frac{64}{3}$.\n\nSumming these terms gives the numerator:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = -\\frac{100}{3} - \\frac{64}{3} - \\frac{100}{3} - \\frac{64}{3} = \\frac{-100 - 64 - 100 - 64}{3} = -\\frac{328}{3} $$\n\n**Step 5: Compute Moran's $I$**\n$$ I = \\frac{\\text{Numerator}}{\\text{Denominator}} = \\frac{-328/3}{328} = -\\frac{1}{3} $$\n\n**Step 6: Final Numerical Value and Interpretation**\nThe exact value of Moran's $I$ is $-\\frac{1}{3}$. The problem asks for this to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ I \\approx -0.3333 $$\n\n**Interpretation:**\nMoran's $I$ theoretically ranges from approximately $-1$ to $+1$.\n*   A positive value indicates positive spatial autocorrelation, where similar values (high-high or low-low) cluster together.\n*   A negative value indicates negative spatial autocorrelation, where dissimilar values (high-low) cluster together, forming a checkerboard-like pattern.\n*   A value near zero suggests a random spatial pattern.\n\nThe computed value is $I = -0.3333$.\n*   **Sign:** The negative sign indicates negative spatial autocorrelation. This means that, on average, tracts with high incidence rates tend to be adjacent to tracts with low incidence rates, and vice-versa.\n*   **Magnitude:** A value of $-0.3333$ represents a moderate degree of negative spatial autocorrelation. It is not a perfect alternating pattern (which would yield an $I$ closer to the theoretical minimum for this specific weights matrix, often near $-1$), but it indicates a clear and statistically observable tendency for dissimilar values to be neighbors.\n\nIn epidemiological terms, this result suggests that the spatial distribution of the disease is not random. Instead, there appears to be a spatial process leading to the clustering of high-rate areas with low-rate areas. This could warrant further investigation into potential causal factors that might vary at this fine spatial scale, such as localized differences in risk factors, demographics, or interventions between adjacent tracts that could produce such a pattern of spatial heterogeneity. For example, two adjacent tracts could have very different socioeconomic profiles, leading to disparate health outcomes.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-0.3333} $$", "id": "4637639"}]}
