Extracted Givens:**\n- Total participants, $n = 1000$.\n- Randomization: $1:1$ ratio to a treatment arm and a control arm.\n- Non-adherence: $10\\%$ of those randomized to treatment discontinue and receive control; $20\\%$ of those randomized to control cross over and receive treatment.\n- Intention-to-treat (ITT) data (by randomized group):\n    - Randomized to treatment: $64$ events, $436$ non-events, total $500$.\n    - Randomized to control: $85$ events, $415$ non-events, total $500$.\n- As-treated (AT) data (by actual treatment received):\n    - Actually received treatment: $67$ events, $483$ non-events, total $550$.\n    - Actually received control: $82$ events, $368$ non-events, total $450$.\n- Assumption: Complete follow-up and unbiased outcome ascertainment.\n- Definition of risk: Proportion of participants with events in a group.\n- Definition of $RD_{\\text{ITT}}$: $\\text{risk}_{\\text{randomized to treatment}} - \\text{risk}_{\\text{randomized to control}}$.\n- Definition of $RD_{\\text{AT}}$: $\\text{risk}_{\\text{actually treated}} - \\text{risk}_{\\text{actually control}}$.\n\n**1.2. Validation using Extracted Givens:**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, employing standard concepts and terminology from epidemiology and clinical trials (RCT, intention-to-treat, as-treated, risk, risk difference). The given data are internally consistent. Let's verify the consistency of the group sizes based on the stated non-adherence rates.\n- Participants randomized to the treatment arm: $N_{\\text{rand_tx}} = 1000 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 500$.\n- Participants randomized to the control arm: $N_{\\text{rand_ctl}} = 1000 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 500$. These match the ITT table.\n- Participants randomized to treatment who adhered: $500 \\times (1 - 0.10) = 500 \\times 0.90 = 450$.\n- Participants randomized to treatment who discontinued (and received control): $500 \\times 0.10 = 50$.\n- Participants randomized to control who adhered: $500 \\times (1 - 0.20) = 500 \\times 0.80 = 400$.\n- Participants randomized to control who crossed over (and received treatment): $500 \\times 0.20 = 100$.\n- Total who actually received treatment: (Adherers from treatment arm) + (Crossovers from control arm) = $450 + 100 = 550$.

This also matches the AT table.\n\nThe problem is well-posed, as all necessary data and definitions are provided for the required calculations. The language is objective and precise. The scenario is realistic. No flaws are identified.\n\n**1.3. Verdict:**\nThe problem is valid. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two risk differences based on two different classifications of the study population.\n\n**2.1. Calculation of the Intention-to-Treat Risk Difference ($RD_{\\text{ITT}}$)**\n\nThe intention-to-treat analysis compares outcomes based on the initial random assignment, regardless of the treatment actually received. This approach preserves the prognostic balance between the groups created by randomization and provides an unbiased estimate of the effect of *assigning* a treatment in a population with expected levels of non-adherence.\n\nLet $R_{\\text{rand_tx}}$ be the risk in the group randomized to treatment and $R_{\\text{rand_ctl}}$ be the risk in the group randomized to control.\nThe number of participants randomized to treatment is $N_{\\text{rand_tx}} = 64 + 436 = 500$.\nThe number of events in this group is $E_{\\text{rand_tx}} = 64$.\nThe risk is:\n$$R_{\\text{rand_tx}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{rand_tx}}}{N_{\\text{rand_tx}}} = \\frac{64}{500} = 0.128$$\n\nThe number of participants randomized to control is $N_{\\text{rand_ctl}} = 85 + 415 = 500$.\nThe number of events in this group is $E_{\\text{rand_ctl}} = 85$.\nThe risk is:\n$$R_{\\text{rand_ctl}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{rand_ctl}}}{N_{\\text{rand_ctl}}} = \\frac{85}{500} = 0.170$$\n\nThe intention-to-treat risk difference is defined as:\n$$RD_{\\text{ITT}} = R_{\\text{rand_tx}} - R_{\\text{rand_ctl}}$$\n$$RD_{\\text{ITT}} = 0.128 - 0.170 = -0.042$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $RD_{\\text{ITT}} = -0.04200$.\n\n**2.2. Calculation of the As-Treated Risk Difference ($RD_{\\text{AT}}$)**\n\nThe as-treated analysis compares outcomes based on the treatment that participants actually received. This analysis is observational in nature and does not preserve the benefits of randomization. It is susceptible to confounding by indication, as the factors that lead a participant to switch or discontinue treatment may also be related to their risk of the outcome.\n\nLet $R_{\\text{actual_tx}}$ be the risk in the group that actually received treatment and $R_{\\text{actual_ctl}}$ be the risk in the group that actually received control.\nFrom the provided table, the number of participants who actually received treatment is $N_{\\text{actual_tx}} = 67 + 483 = 550$.\nThe number of events in this group is $E_{\\text{actual_tx}} = 67$.\nThe risk is:\n$$R_{\\text{actual_tx}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{actual_tx}}}{N_{\\text{actual_tx}}} = \\frac{67}{550} \\approx 0.12181818...$$\n\nThe number of participants who actually received control is $N_{\\text{actual_ctl}} = 82 + 368 = 450$.\nThe number of events in this group is $E_{\\text{actual_ctl}} = 82$.\nThe risk is:\n$$R_{\\text{actual_ctl}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{actual_ctl}}}{N_{\\text{actual_ctl}}} = \\frac{82}{450} \\approx 0.18222222...$$\n\nThe as-treated risk difference is defined as:\n$$RD_{\\text{AT}} = R_{\\text{actual_tx}} - R_{\\text{actual_ctl}}$$\n$$RD_{\\text{AT}} = \\frac{67}{550} - \\frac{82}{450} \\approx 0.12181818... - 0.18222222... = -0.06040404...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $RD_{\\text{AT}} = -0.06040$.\n\nThe problem asks for both results reported in the order $(RD_{\\text{ITT}}, RD_{\\text{AT}})$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -0.04200 & -0.06040 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4603081"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a basic comparison to a more formal statistical analysis, this practice focuses on quantifying both the ITT effect and its associated uncertainty.

The concepts presented—RCT, randomization, ITT analysis, per-protocol analysis, missing data, and competing risks—are fundamental to biostatistics and epidemiology. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It clearly defines the setting, the variables, and the target estimand ($\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ITT}}$). The task is to evaluate several proposed analytical strategies against the established principles of ITT analysis. A unique and meaningful evaluation is possible for each option.\n-   **Objective (Critical)**: The problem is stated in precise, technical language common to the field of clinical trials. It is free from ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution and evaluation of the options.\n\nThe core principle of an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis is to analyze all participants in the group to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of adherence, crossover, or other events occurring after randomization. This preserves the prognostic balance of measured and unmeasured covariates between the treatment and control groups that is achieved by randomization. The ITT estimand, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ITT}}$, measures the causal effect of *assignment* to a treatment strategy on the outcome in the entire population randomized. Any analysis that breaks randomization by excluding participants or adjusting for post-randomization variables on the causal pathway will generally be biased for this estimand.\n\nEach option will be evaluated based on whether its \"pitfall\" is a true violation of ITT principles and whether its \"correction\" is a valid method for preserving the ITT estimand, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ITT}}$.\n\n**Option A Evaluation**\n-   **Pitfall**: \"Exclude participants who did not adhere ($A=0$) or who crossed over, and compare mean $Y$ between the remaining groups.\" This is a classic violation of the ITT principle. Excluding participants based on a post-randomization behavior ($A$) breaks the randomization. The remaining groups are no longer guaranteed to be comparable because adherence can be related to prognosis. This type of analysis, often called a \"per-protocol\" or \"on-treatment\" analysis, is susceptible to selection bias. The pitfall is correctly identified as a violation of ITT analysis.\n-   **Correction**: \"Use inverse probability weights based on $A$ to estimate the effect among adherers (a per-protocol effect).\" This correction describes a valid method, under certain assumptions, for estimating a causal effect. However, as explicitly stated, it targets the \"per-protocol effect,\" which is the effect of treatment receipt among the subpopulation of adherers. This is a fundamentally different estimand from the ITT effect, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ITT}}$, which is the effect of treatment assignment among the entire randomized population. Therefore, this correction does not preserve the ITT estimand.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect. The proposed correction targets a different estimand.\n\n**Option B Evaluation**\n-   **Pitfall**: \"Perform a complete-case analysis that drops participants with $R=0$.\" This violates the ITT principle of including all randomized participants. If the reason for missingness is related to both treatment and outcome (i.e., data are not Missing Completely At Random or MCAR), this will induce selection bias. Even under the less restrictive Missing At Random (MAR) assumption, a complete-case analysis can be biased. The pitfall is correctly identified.\n-   **Correction**: \"Impute missing $Y$ under a model that conditions on $Z$ and baseline covariates $L_0$ (but not on any post-randomization variables), create multiple completed datasets, and estimate $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ITT}}$ by comparing groups defined by $Z$ in each imputed dataset with combination by Rubin's rules.\" This describes a standard, principled approach for handling missing data in an ITT analysis under the MAR assumption (i.e., missingness depends only on observed data like $Z$ and $L_0$). By imputing the missing outcomes, it allows the analysis to include all randomized participants. Critically, the imputation model avoids using post-randomization information that could introduce bias, and the subsequent analysis respects the original randomization by comparing groups based on $Z$. This procedure is designed to provide an unbiased estimate of $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ITT}}$ for the full cohort.\n-   **Verdict**: Correct. The pitfall is an ITT violation, and the correction is a valid method to handle missing data while preserving the ITT estimand.\n\n**Option C Evaluation**\n-   **Pitfall**: \"Adjust for the post-randomization biomarker $M$ in a regression of $Y$ on $Z$ and $M$ to “improve precision.”\" This is a violation of sound analytical practice for estimating the total ITT effect. The biomarker $M$ is measured after randomization and may be on the causal pathway from treatment assignment $Z$ to outcome $Y$ (i.e., $Z \\rightarrow M \\rightarrow Y$). Adjusting for such a variable blocks a portion of the treatment effect, leading to a biased estimate of the total effect $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ITT}}$. It could also induce collider-stratification bias if $M$ is a common effect of $Z$ and an unmeasured cause of $Y$. The pitfall is correctly identified.\n-   **Correction**: \"Include $M$ as a covariate so that residual variation unrelated to $M$ is compared between $Z=1$ and $Z=0$.\" This is not a \"correction\" but a restatement and flawed justification of the pitfall. It describes the goal of the incorrect adjustment but does not remedy its fundamental flaw. The estimand targeted by this adjusted analysis is the direct effect of $Z$ on $Y$ not mediated by $M$, which is not the total ITT effect $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ITT}}$.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect. The proposed correction is not a correction and does not preserve the ITT estimand.\n\n**Option D Evaluation**\n-   **Pitfall**: \"Exclude participants who die before $t=12$ months ($D=1$) to avoid “undefined” $Y$.\" This is a severe violation of the ITT principle. Death is an outcome that is often affected by the intervention. Excluding participants who died is a form of conditioning on survival, a post-randomization event, which can lead to significant selection bias. For example, if a treatment prevents death, the treated group at $t=12$ months will contain more frail individuals who would have died in the control arm, potentially making the treatment appear worse on the outcome $Y$ among survivors. The pitfall is correctly identified.\n-   **Correction**: \"Redefine the endpoint so that death before $t=12$ months is assigned the worst possible outcome value and include all randomized participants in the analysis by $Z$.\" This is a valid and common strategy for handling the competing risk of death in an ITT analysis. The problem statement itself requires that $Y$ be defined for all participants. This correction fulfills that requirement by creating a composite outcome (e.g., a ranked outcome where death is the worst rank, or assigning a specific unfavorable value for $Y$ like a very high blood pressure). This allows all randomized individuals to be included in their assigned groups, thereby fully adhering to the ITT principle. This method estimates the treatment effect on a meaningful, composite endpoint for the entire randomized cohort.\n-   **Verdict**: Correct. The pitfall is an ITT violation, and the correction is a valid method to handle a competing risk while preserving the ITT principle.\n\n**Option E Evaluation**\n-   **Pitfall**: \"Conduct an “as-treated” analysis that compares those who actually received the novel strategy to those who did not, regardless of $Z$.\" This completely discards randomization, the cornerstone of the trial. The comparison is now observational and highly susceptible to confounding by indication (i.e., the reasons a person actually received the treatment are related to their prognosis). This is a flagrant violation of ITT. The pitfall is correctly identified.\n-   **Correction**: \"Apply two-stage least squares with $Z$ as an instrument for treatment received to remove confounding by $A$.\" This describes an Instrumental Variable (IV) analysis. While IV is a valid method for estimating a causal effect in the presence of non-compliance, it does not estimate the ITT effect. Under its standard assumptions, IV analysis estimates the Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE), which is the effect of actually receiving the treatment among the specific subpopulation of individuals who comply with their treatment assignment. The CACE is a different estimand from $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ITT}}$.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect. The proposed correction targets a different estimand (CACE), not the ITT estimand.\n\nIn summary, options B and D correctly identify a pitfall that violates ITT analysis and a corresponding correction that validly aims to preserve the ITT estimand by including all randomized participants in the analysis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BD}$$", "id": "4603249"}]}
