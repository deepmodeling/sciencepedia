The ICER is a fundamental metric in health economics used to evaluate the value for money of a health intervention. It is defined as the ratio of the change in costs to the change in health benefits (effectiveness) of the new strategy relative to the comparator.\n\nThe formula for the ICER is:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{C_{\\mathcal{N}} - C_{\\mathcal{C}}}{E_{\\mathcal{N}} - E_{\\mathcal{C}}}\n$$\nwhere:\n- $\\Delta C$ is the incremental cost.\n- $\\Delta E$ is the incremental effectiveness.\n- $C_{\\mathcal{N}}$ and $E_{\\mathcal{N}}$ are the cost and effectiveness of the new strategy ($\\mathcal{N}$).\n- $C_{\\mathcal{C}}$ and $E_{\\mathcal{C}}$ are the cost and effectiveness of the comparator strategy ($\\mathcal{C}$).\n\nFrom the problem statement, the given values are:\n- Cost of strategy $\\mathcal{N}$: $C_{\\mathcal{N}} = \\$4{,}350$\n- Effectiveness of strategy $\\mathcal{N}$: $E_{\\mathcal{N}} = 7.982$ QALYs\n- Cost of strategy $\\mathcal{C}$: $C_{\\mathcal{C}} = \\$5{,}550$\n- Effectiveness of strategy $\\mathcal{C}$: $E_{\\mathcal{C}} = 7.778$ QALYs\n\nFirst, we calculate the incremental cost ($\\Delta C$):\n$$\n\\Delta C = C_{\\mathcal{N}} - C_{\\mathcal{C}} = \\$4{,}350 - \\$5{,}550 = -\\$1{,}200\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that strategy $\\mathcal{N}$ is less costly than strategy $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the incremental effectiveness ($\\Delta E$):\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_{\\mathcal{N}} - E_{\\mathcal{C}} = 7.982 \\text{ QALYs} - 7.778 \\text{ QALYs} = 0.204 \\text{ QALYs}\n$$\nThe positive sign indicates that strategy $\\mathcal{N}$ is more effective (provides more health benefit) than strategy $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\nNow, we can compute the ICER:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{-\\$1{,}200}{0.204 \\text{ QALYs}} \\approx -5882.3529... \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{QALY}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

Here, $\\Delta C  0$ (negative) and $\\Delta E > 0$ (positive). This scenario places strategy $\\mathcal{N}$ in the southeast quadrant of the cost-effectiveness plane (where the x-axis represents $\\Delta E$ and the y-axis represents $\\Delta C$).\n\nThe interpretation of a negative ICER depends on the quadrant.\n1.  If $\\Delta C > 0$ and $\\Delta E  0$ (northwest quadrant), the new strategy is more expensive and less effective. It is \"dominated\" by the comparator, and the decision is to reject it.\n2.  If $\\Delta C  0$ and $\\Delta E > 0$ (southeast quadrant), the new strategy is less expensive and more effective. This is the current case. The new strategy is said to be \"dominant.\"\n\nIn this problem, strategy $\\mathcal{N}$ is dominant over strategy $\\mathcal{C}$. It achieves better health outcomes (more QALYs) at a lower cost. From a purely cost-effectiveness standpoint, the decision is straightforward: strategy $\\mathcal{N}$ should be adopted. The negative ICER of $-\\$5{,}882$ per QALY means that for every QALY gained by choosing strategy $\\mathcal{N}$ over strategy $\\mathcal{C}$, there is a cost saving of $\\$5{,}882$.

In these cases, the ICER alone does not tell us whether the extra cost is \"worth it.\" This practice introduces the concept of a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold, $\\lambda$, which represents the maximum amount a decision-maker is willing to spend for an additional unit of health gain.

The ICER represents the additional cost for each additional unit of health outcome (in this case, QALYs).

The NMB translates the incremental health benefits into monetary terms using the WTP threshold and subtracts the incremental costs. A positive NMB indicates that the intervention is cost-effective.

To express this with $4$ significant figures, we use scientific notation: $1.000 \\times 10^4$.\n\nThird, we compute the NHB. The NHB translates the incremental costs into an equivalent \"health opportunity cost\" (in QALYs) and subtracts it from the incremental health benefits. A positive NHB indicates that the intervention is cost-effective. The formula is:\n$$\n\\text{NHB} = \\Delta E - \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\lambda}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\text{NHB} = 0.5 \\text{ QALYs} - \\frac{\\$15000}{\\$50000/\\text{QALY}} = 0.5 \\text{ QALYs} - 0.3 \\text{ QALYs} = 0.2 \\text{ QALYs}\n$$\nThe exact value is $0.2$. To express this with $4$ significant figures, we write it as $0.2000$.\n\nFinally, we determine the adoption decision. An intervention is considered cost-effective if its ICER is less than or equal to the decision-maker's willingness-to-pay threshold ($\\lambda$).\n$$\n\\text{ICER} \\le \\lambda\n$$\n$$\n\\$30000/\\text{QALY} \\le \\$50000/\\text{QALY}\n$$\nThis condition is satisfied.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe analysis begins by organizing the strategies according to their effectiveness, which is a prerequisite for correctly identifying dominated options and calculating incremental ratios. The strategies are ordered by increasing QALYs.\n\nLet $C_i$ be the cost and $E_i$ be the effect for strategy $i \\in \\{A, B, C\\}$.

We compare each pair:\n- Comparing B to A: $E_B > E_A$ ($9.96 > 9.94$) and $C_B > C_A$ ($380 > 275$). Neither strategy simply dominates the other.\n- Comparing C to B: $E_C > E_B$ ($10.03 > 9.96$) and $C_C > C_B$ ($510 > 380$). Neither strategy simply dominates the other.\n- Comparing C to A: $E_C > E_A$ ($10.03 > 9.94$) and $C_C > C_A$ ($510 > 275$). Neither strategy simply dominates the other.\nConclusion: There are no simply dominated strategies. All three strategies are potential candidates for the cost-effectiveness frontier.\n\n**Analysis of Extended Dominance**\nExtended dominance occurs when a strategy's incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is greater than that of a more effective strategy. This means the intermediate strategy is inefficient compared to a combination of its less and more effective neighbors. We calculate the ICER for each sequential step on the ordered list of strategies.\n\nThe ICER is defined as the change in cost divided by the change in effect: $ICER = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E}$.\n\n1.

Calculate the ICER for moving from Strategy B to Strategy C:\n    $$ICER_{B \\to C} = \\frac{C_C - C_B}{E_C - E_B} = \\frac{510 - 380}{10.03 - 9.96} = \\frac{130}{0.07} \\approx 1857.14 \\text{ USD/QALY}$$\n\nNow, we compare the ICERs. For a set of non-dominated strategies, the ICERs should be strictly increasing.\nWe have $ICER_{A \\to B} = 5250$ and $ICER_{B \\to C} \\approx 1857.14$.\nSince $ICER_{A \\to B} > ICER_{B \\to C}$, the sequence of ICERs is not monotonically increasing. This indicates that Strategy B is subject to extended dominance. The cost per QALY gained by moving from A to B ($5250$) is higher than the cost per QALY gained by moving from B to C ($\\approx 1857.14$). This is inefficient. A decision-maker would be better off \"skipping\" strategy B and considering C directly against A.\n\nTherefore, Strategy B is eliminated from the set of efficient strategies.\n\n**Final ICER Calculation**\nAfter eliminating the extendedly dominated Strategy B, the remaining efficient comparison is between Strategy C and Strategy A. These two strategies now define the cost-effectiveness frontier. We compute the ICER for this final comparison.\n\n$$ICER_{A \\to C} = \\frac{C_C - C_A}{E_C - E_A} = \\frac{510 - 275}{10.03 - 9.94} = \\frac{235}{0.09}$$\n\n$$ICER_{A \\to C} = 2611.111... \\text{ USD/QALY}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe number is $2611.111...$.
