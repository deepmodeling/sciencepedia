The risk values are valid probabilities ($0 < 0.09 < 0.12 < 1$). The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data for the requested calculations, leading to a unique solution. The language is objective and unambiguous. The problem is free of scientific flaws, contradictions, or missing information.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid.

From the problem statement, we have:\n$$R_{control} = 0.12$$\n$$R_{treat} = 0.09$$\n\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) is defined as the arithmetic difference in risk between the control group and the treatment group. It quantifies the absolute reduction in the probability of the event due to the therapy.\n$$ARR = R_{control} - R_{treat}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ARR = 0.12 - 0.09 = 0.03$$\nThe problem specifies to express ARR as a decimal, which $0.03$ is.\n\nThe Relative Risk Reduction (RRR) is defined as the proportional reduction in risk. It is the ARR divided by the baseline risk of the control group. It measures the reduction in risk relative to the baseline level.\n$$RRR = \\frac{R_{control} - R_{treat}}{R_{control}} = \\frac{ARR}{R_{control}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated ARR and the given baseline risk:\n$$RRR = \\frac{0.03}{0.12} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$$\nThe problem specifies to express RRR as a decimal, which $0.25$ is.\n\nThe Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Reduction. It represents the average number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one additional adverse outcome.\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nSubstituting the value of ARR:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.03} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{100}} = \\frac{100}{3}$$\nThe problem requires an exact analytical expression, and $\\frac{100}{3}$ is the exact fractional form, which is more precise than a repeating decimal.\n\nFinally, to translate these individual-level metrics into a population outcome, we calculate the expected number of events prevented in a treated cohort of a given size. Let $N$ be the number of individuals in the cohort, where $N = 100,000$. The number of events prevented, $E_{prevented}$, is the product of the cohort size and the ARR.\n$$E_{prevented} = N \\times ARR$$\nSubstituting the values for $N$ and ARR:\n$$E_{prevented} = 100,000 \\times 0.03 = 3,000$$\nThis means that by treating a population of $100,000$ individuals, we expect to prevent $3,000$ adverse health events.\n\nThe final results are compiled into a single row vector in the specified order: $[\\text{ARR}, \\text{RRR}, \\text{NNT}, \\text{events prevented}]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.03 & 0.25 & \\frac{100}{3} & 3000\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4621159"}, {"introduction": "Public health decisions often involve choosing between different strategies with limited resources, making quantitative comparison essential.

This part is correct.\n-   The statement is a composite of three true claims.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Because the relative risk reduction is larger for Program X than for Program Y, Program X must have a lower Number Needed to Treat in this context.**\n-   The premise is that $RRR_X > RRR_Y$, which is true ($50\\% > 20\\%$).\n-   The conclusion is that $NNT_X$ must be lower than $NNT_Y$.\n-   Let's compare the calculated values: $NNT_X = 1{,}000$ and $NNT_Y = 50$.\n-   The conclusion is false; $1{,}000$ is not lower than $50$.\n-   The reasoning is flawed. $NNT$ is the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Reduction ($NNT = 1/ARR$), not the Relative Risk Reduction. A large $RRR$ can be associated with a very small $ARR$ if the baseline risk ($R_{control}$) is low, leading to a large $NNT$. This is exactly the case here.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. At the population level in this city, Program Y prevents more total hospitalizations per year than Program X.**\n-   This compares the total expected hospitalizations prevented by each program.\n-   We calculated $EHP_Y = 1{,}600$ and $EHP_X = 720$.\n-   Since $1{,}600 > 720$, the statement is true.

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of epidemiology and statistics, well-posed with all necessary information, and stated objectively. The task is to compute stratum-specific and pooled risk ratios to demonstrate the paradox.\n\nLet $E$ denote the exposure and $\\bar{E}$ its absence. Let $O$ denote the adverse outcome. We are given two strata: a high-baseline-risk stratum, $S_H$, and a low-baseline-risk stratum, $S_L$. Risk is defined as the probability of the outcome in a specified group, estimated as the proportion of individuals in the group who experience the outcome. The risk ratio ($RR$) is the ratio of the risk in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group.\n\nThe data provided are:\n- In stratum $S_H$:\n  - Exposed ($E$): $N_{E,H} = 900$ individuals with $O_{E,H} = 270$ outcomes.\n  - Unexposed ($\\bar{E}$): $N_{\\bar{E},H} = 100$ individuals with $O_{\\bar{E},H} = 40$ outcomes.\n- In stratum $S_L$:\n  - Exposed ($E$): $N_{E,L} = 100$ individuals with $O_{E,L} = 2$ outcomes.\n  - Unexposed ($\\bar{E}$): $N_{\\bar{E},L} = 900$ individuals with $O_{\\bar{E},L} = 45$ outcomes.\n\n**1. Stratum-Specific Risks and Risk Ratios**\n\nFirst, we compute the risks and the risk ratio within the high-baseline-risk stratum ($S_H$).\nThe risk in the exposed group is:\n$$R_{E,H} = \\frac{O_{E,H}}{N_{E,H}} = \\frac{270}{900} = 0.3$$\nThe risk in the unexposed group is:\n$$R_{\\bar{E},H} = \\frac{O_{\\bar{E},H}}{N_{\\bar{E},H}} = \\frac{40}{100} = 0.4$$\nThe stratum-specific risk ratio for $S_H$ is:\n$$RR_H = \\frac{R_{E,H}}{R_{\\bar{E},H}} = \\frac{0.3}{0.4} = 0.75$$\nSince $RR_H < 1$, the exposure appears to be protective in the high-risk stratum, reducing the risk of the outcome by $25\\%$.\n\nNext, we compute the risks and the risk ratio within the low-baseline-risk stratum ($S_L$).\nThe risk in the exposed group is:\n$$R_{E,L} = \\frac{O_{E,L}}{N_{E,L}} = \\frac{2}{100} = 0.02$$\nThe risk in the unexposed group is:\n$$R_{\\bar{E},L} = \\frac{O_{\\bar{E},L}}{N_{\\bar{E},L}} = \\frac{45}{900} = 0.05$$\nThe stratum-specific risk ratio for $S_L$ is:\n$$RR_L = \\frac{R_{E,L}}{R_{\\bar{E},L}} = \\frac{0.02}{0.05} = 0.4$$\nSince $RR_L < 1$, the exposure also appears to be protective in the low-risk stratum, reducing the risk of the outcome by $60\\%$.\n\n**2. Population-Level (Marginal) Risk Ratio**\n\nTo compute the population-level or marginal risk ratio, we pool the data from both strata, ignoring the distinction between them.\nTotal number of exposed individuals:\n$$N_E = N_{E,H} + N_{E,L} = 900 + 100 = 1000$$\nTotal number of outcomes in exposed individuals:\n$$O_E = O_{E,H} + O_{E,L} = 270 + 2 = 272$$\nTotal number of unexposed individuals:\n$$N_{\\bar{E}} = N_{\\bar{E},H} + N_{\\bar{E},L} = 100 + 900 = 1000$$\nTotal number of outcomes in unexposed individuals:\n$$O_{\\bar{E}} = O_{\\bar{E},H} + O_{\\bar{E},L} = 40 + 45 = 85$$\n\nThe marginal risk in the exposed group is:\n$$R_E = \\frac{O_E}{N_E} = \\frac{272}{1000} = 0.272$$\nThe marginal risk in the unexposed group is:\n$$R_{\\bar{E}} = \\frac{O_{\\bar{E}}}{N_{\\bar{E}}} = \\frac{85}{1000} = 0.085$$\nThe marginal risk ratio is:\n$$RR_{marginal} = \\frac{R_E}{R_{\\bar{E}}} = \\frac{0.272}{0.085} \\approx 3.2$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the marginal risk ratio is $3.200$.\n\n**3. Reversal of Association and Interpretation**\n\nWithin both the high-risk and low-risk strata, the exposure was found to be protective, with risk ratios of $RR_H = 0.75$ and $RR_L = 0.4$, respectively. However, the population-level (marginal) analysis yields a risk ratio of $RR_{marginal} \\approx 3.2$, suggesting that the exposure is harmful and increases the risk of the outcome by a factor of $3.2$. The direction of the association is reversed from protective ($RR < 1$) in each stratum to harmful ($RR > 1$) in the pooled population. This phenomenon is a classic example of Simpson's paradox.\n\nThe reversal occurs due to confounding by the stratifying variable, 'baseline risk'. A confounder is a variable that is associated with both the exposure and the outcome.\n1.  **Association with Exposure**: Baseline risk is strongly associated with the exposure. In the high-risk stratum, $90\\%$ of the subjects are exposed ($900/1000$), whereas in the low-risk stratum, only $10\\%$ are exposed ($100/1000$). The exposure is preferentially given to high-risk individuals.\n2.  **Association with Outcome**: Baseline risk is, by definition, associated with the outcome, independent of the exposure. The risk among the unexposed in the high-risk stratum ($R_{\\bar{E},H} = 0.4$) is $8$ times the risk among the unexposed in the low-risk stratum ($R_{\\bar{E},L} = 0.05$).\n\nThe crude risk among the exposed, $R_E$, is overwhelmingly weighted by the experience of the high-risk group (since they constitute $90\\%$ of the exposed). Conversely, the crude risk among the unexposed, $R_{\\bar{E}}$, is overwhelmingly weighted by the experience of the low-risk group (since they constitute $90\\%$ of the unexposed). The marginal risk ratio, $RR_{marginal}$, is therefore not comparing like with like; it is effectively comparing the risk in a predominantly high-risk group (the exposed) with the risk in a predominantly low-risk group (the unexposed). This confounding creates a spurious association, making the protective exposure appear harmful at the population level.\n\nThe population health lesson is that aggregating data across heterogeneous groups can obscure or even reverse the true association. The marginal association is a misleading mixture of the effects within different subgroups. Failure to account for confounders can lead to incorrect conclusions about public health interventions and risk factors. The stratum-specific measures of association, $RR_H$ and $RR_L$, provide a more valid picture of the exposure's effect.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.200}\n$$", "id": "4621148"}]}
