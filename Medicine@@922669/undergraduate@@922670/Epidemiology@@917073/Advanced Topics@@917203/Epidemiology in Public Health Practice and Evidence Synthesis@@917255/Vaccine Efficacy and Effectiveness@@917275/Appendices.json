It is scientifically grounded in established epidemiological principles, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. I will now proceed with a formal solution.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) Estimator\n\nVaccine Effectiveness ($VE$) is defined as the proportional reduction in the risk of disease among vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals. It is expressed in terms of the relative risk ($RR$) of the disease, where $RR$ is the ratio of the attack rate in the vaccinated ($AR_v$) to the attack rate in the unvaccinated ($AR_u$).\n\n$$VE = 1 - RR = 1 - \\frac{AR_v}{AR_u}$$\n\nThe screening method is a type of case-control study design where the \"controls\" are a sample of the total source population from which the cases arose. In such a design, we do not directly measure attack rates. Instead, we measure the odds of exposure (vaccination) among cases and among the source population.\n\nThe odds of an event is the probability of the event occurring divided by the probability of it not occurring. Let $PCV$ be the proportion of cases who are vaccinated and $PPV$ be the proportion of the source population who are vaccinated.\n\nThe odds of vaccination among the cases is:\n$$Odds_{cases} = \\frac{P(\\text{Vaccinated | Case})}{P(\\text{Unvaccinated | Case})} = \\frac{PCV}{1-PCV}$$\n\nThe odds of vaccination in the source population (our control group) is:\n$$Odds_{pop} = \\frac{P(\\text{Vaccinated in Pop})}{P(\\text{Unvaccinated in Pop})} = \\frac{PPV}{1-PPV}$$\n\nThe odds ratio ($OR$) of vaccination compares these two odds:\n$$OR_{vax} = \\frac{Odds_{cases}}{Odds_{pop}}$$\n\nUnder the core assumption of the screening method (and case-control studies in general, particularly when the disease is rare), the odds ratio of exposure ($OR_{vax}$) is a good estimator of the relative risk of disease ($RR$).\n$$RR \\approx OR_{vax}$$\n\nSubstituting this into the definition of $VE$, we get the screening method estimator for Vaccine Effectiveness:\n$$VE \\approx 1 - OR_{vax} = 1 - \\frac{PCV / (1-PCV)}{PPV / (1-PPV)}$$\n\n### Part 2: Point Estimate of VE\n\nWe are given the following data:\n- Proportion of Cases Vaccinated, $PCV = 0.3$.\n- Proportion of the Population Vaccinated, $PPV = 0.6$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the odds ratio estimator, $\\widehat{OR}$.\nThe estimated odds of vaccination among cases is:\n$$\\widehat{Odds}_{cases} = \\frac{PCV}{1-PCV} = \\frac{0.3}{1-0.3} = \\frac{0.3}{0.7} = \\frac{3}{7}$$\n\nThe estimated odds of vaccination in the population is:\n$$\\widehat{Odds}_{pop} = \\frac{PPV}{1-PPV} = \\frac{0.6}{1-0.6} = \\frac{0.6}{0.4} = 1.5 = \\frac{3}{2}$$\n\nThe estimated odds ratio is:\n$$\\widehat{OR} = \\frac{\\widehat{Odds}_{cases}}{\\widehat{Odds}_{pop}} = \\frac{3/7}{3/2} = \\frac{3}{7} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{7}$$\n\nNow, we can compute the point estimate of Vaccine Effectiveness, $\\widehat{VE}$:\n$$\\widehat{VE} = 1 - \\widehat{OR} = 1 - \\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{5}{7}$$\n\nAs a decimal rounded to four significant figures:\n$$\\widehat{VE} \\approx 0.7142857 \\dots \\approx 0.7143$$\n\n### Part 3: 95% Confidence Interval for VE\n\nTo construct the confidence interval, we work on the natural logarithm scale of the odds ratio, where the sampling distribution is approximately normal for large samples.\n\nThe number of subjects in the case sample is $n_C = 200$. The number of vaccinated cases is $V_C = n_C \\times PCV = 200 \\times 0.3 = 60$. The number of unvaccinated cases is $U_C = n_C \\times (1-PCV) = 200 \\times 0.7 = 140$.\n\nThe number of subjects in the population survey is $n_P = 500$. The number of vaccinated individuals in the survey is $V_P = n_P \\times PPV = 500 \\times 0.6 = 300$. The number of unvaccinated individuals in the survey is $U_P = n_P \\times (1-PPV) = 500 \\times 0.4 = 200$.\n\nThe variance of the log odds ratio, $\\ln(\\widehat{OR})$, is estimated by the sum of the reciprocals of these four counts (Woolf's method), stemming from the fact that the two samples (cases and population) are independent.\n$$\\text{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{OR})) \\approx \\frac{1}{V_C} + \\frac{1}{U_C} + \\frac{1}{V_P} + \\frac{1}{U_P}$$\n$$\\text{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{OR})) \\approx \\frac{1}{60} + \\frac{1}{140} + \\frac{1}{300} + \\frac{1}{200}$$\n$$= \\frac{70}{4200} + \\frac{30}{4200} + \\frac{14}{4200} + \\frac{21}{4200} = \\frac{70+30+14+21}{4200} = \\frac{135}{4200} = \\frac{9}{280}$$\nSo, $\\text{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{OR})) = \\frac{9}{280}$.\n\nThe standard error ($SE$) of the log odds ratio is the square root of the variance:\n$$SE(\\ln(\\widehat{OR})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{280}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{280}} \\approx 0.179284$$\n\nThe $95\\%$ confidence interval for the log odds ratio is given by:\n$$CI_{\\ln(OR)} = \\ln(\\widehat{OR}) \\pm Z_{0.975} \\times SE(\\ln(\\widehat{OR}))$$\nwhere $Z_{0.975} \\approx 1.96$ is the $97.5$-th percentile of the standard normal distribution.\n\nWe have $\\ln(\\widehat{OR}) = \\ln(2/7) \\approx -1.252763$.\nThe margin of error ($ME$) is:\n$$ME = 1.96 \\times \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{280}} \\approx 1.96 \\times 0.179284 \\approx 0.351397$$\n\nThe confidence limits for $\\ln(OR)$ are:\nLower limit: $L_{\\ln(OR)} = -1.252763 - 0.351397 = -1.604160$\nUpper limit: $U_{\\ln(OR)} = -1.252763 + 0.351397 = -0.901366$\n\nTo get the confidence interval for the odds ratio $OR$, we exponentiate these limits:\nLower limit: $OR_L = \\exp(L_{\\ln(OR)}) = \\exp(-1.604160) \\approx 0.201066$\nUpper limit: $OR_U = \\exp(U_{\\ln(OR)}) = \\exp(-0.901366) \\approx 0.406000$\n\nFinally, we transform the confidence interval for $OR$ to a confidence interval for $VE$ using the relationship $VE = 1 - OR$.

This is consistent with the constant $RR_{UY}$ assumption.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is a standard exercise in quantitative bias analysis (QBA) for unmeasured confounding in epidemiology. The definitions and parameters ($VE_{\\text{obs}}$, $RR_{\\text{obs}}$, $RR_{UY}$, $RR_{UZ}$) are standard in the field. The scenario described—prioritization of high-risk individuals for vaccination leading to confounding—is realistic. The assumptions of a single binary confounder, no effect modification, and a multiplicative risk model are common simplifying assumptions used to make bias analysis tractable. The problem is self-contained, logically consistent, and provides all necessary information to derive a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Solution\n\nThe objective is to find the bias-adjusted vaccine effectiveness, $VE_{\\text{adj}}$. This requires relating the observed risk ratio, $RR_{\\text{obs}}$, to the adjusted (causal) risk ratio, $RR_{\\text{adj}}$, by accounting for the confounding bias.\n\nFirst, we express the observed risk of infection in the vaccinated ($Z=1$) and unvaccinated ($Z=0$) groups by stratifying on the unmeasured confounder $U$. Let $R_z = P(Y=1 \\mid Z=z)$ be the risk in exposure group $z$. By the law of total probability:\n$$R_1 = P(Y=1 \\mid Z=1) = P(Y=1 \\mid Z=1, U=1)P(U=1 \\mid Z=1) + P(Y=1 \\mid Z=1, U=0)P(U=0 \\mid Z=1)$$\n$$R_0 = P(Y=1 \\mid Z=0) = P(Y=1 \\mid Z=0, U=1)P(U=1 \\mid Z=0) + P(Y=1 \\mid Z=0, U=0)P(U=0 \\mid Z=0)$$\n\nLet's introduce our parameters. Let $p_z = P(U=1 \\mid Z=z)$. Then $P(U=0 \\mid Z=z) = 1 - p_z$.\nLet $R_{zu} = P(Y=1 \\mid Z=z, U=u)$. The equations become:\n$$R_1 = R_{11} p_1 + R_{10} (1 - p_1)$$\n$$R_0 = R_{01} p_0 + R_{00} (1 - p_0)$$\n\nWe can rewrite these as:\n$$R_1 = R_{10} (1 - p_1) + R_{11} p_1 = R_{10} (1 - p_1 + \\frac{R_{11}}{R_{10}} p_1)$$\n$$R_0 = R_{00} (1 - p_0) + R_{01} p_0 = R_{00} (1 - p_0 + \\frac{R_{01}}{R_{00}} p_0)$$\n\nFrom the problem statement, the confounder-outcome risk ratio is $RR_{UY} = \\frac{R_{z1}}{R_{z0}}$ for $z \\in \\{0,1\\}$. The assumption of no effect modification by $U$ on the vaccine effect means the adjusted risk ratio $RR_{\\text{adj}} = \\frac{R_{1u}}{R_{0u}}$ is constant for $u \\in \\{0,1\\}$. This implies $R_{10} = RR_{\\text{adj}} R_{00}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expressions for $R_1$ and $R_0$:\n$$R_1 = R_{10} (1 - p_1 + RR_{UY} p_1) = R_{10} (1 + p_1(RR_{UY}-1))$$\n$$R_0 = R_{00} (1 - p_0 + RR_{UY} p_0) = R_{00} (1 + p_0(RR_{UY}-1))$$\n\nThe observed risk ratio is $RR_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{R_1}{R_0}$:\n$$RR_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{R_{10} (1 + p_1(RR_{UY}-1))}{R_{00} (1 + p_0(RR_{UY}-1))} = \\frac{R_{10}}{R_{00}} \\times \\frac{1 + p_1(RR_{UY}-1)}{1 + p_0(RR_{UY}-1)}$$\nRecognizing that $\\frac{R_{10}}{R_{00}} = RR_{\\text{adj}}$, we have:\n$$RR_{\\text{obs}} = RR_{\\text{adj}} \\times B$$\nwhere $B = \\frac{1 + p_1(RR_{UY}-1)}{1 + p_0(RR_{UY}-1)}$ is the multiplicative confounding factor.\n\nWe are given $RR_{UZ} = \\frac{p_1}{p_0} = 2.0$, so $p_1 = RR_{UZ} p_0$. Substituting this into the expression for $B$:\n$$B = \\frac{1 + (RR_{UZ}p_0)(RR_{UY}-1)}{1 + p_0(RR_{UY}-1)}$$\nThe factor $B$ depends on the unknown prevalence of the confounder in the unvaccinated group, $p_0$. To find the maximal confounding factor, we must find the maximum value of $B$ with respect to $p_0$. The prevalences $p_0$ and $p_1$ are probabilities and must lie in the interval $[0,1]$.\n$0 \\le p_0 \\le 1$\n$0 \\le p_1 = RR_{UZ} p_0 \\le 1 \\implies p_0 \\le \\frac{1}{RR_{UZ}}$\nCombining these, the permissible range for $p_0$ is $[0, \\frac{1}{RR_{UZ}}]$.\n\nTo find the maximum of $B$ as a function of $p_0$, we examine its derivative:\n$$\\frac{dB}{dp_0} = \\frac{(RR_{UZ})(RR_{UY}-1)(1 + p_0(RR_{UY}-1)) - (RR_{UY}-1)(1 + RR_{UZ}p_0(RR_{UY}-1))}{(1 + p_0(RR_{UY}-1))^2}$$\n$$\\frac{dB}{dp_0} = \\frac{(RR_{UY}-1)[RR_{UZ} + RR_{UZ}p_0(RR_{UY}-1) - 1 - RR_{UZ}p_0(RR_{UY}-1)]}{(1 + p_0(RR_{UY}-1))^2}$$\n$$\\frac{dB}{dp_0} = \\frac{(RR_{UY}-1)(RR_{UZ}-1)}{(1 + p_0(RR_{UY}-1))^2}$$\nGiven $RR_{UY} = 2.0 > 1$ and $RR_{UZ} = 2.0 > 1$, the numerator $(RR_{UY}-1)(RR_{UZ}-1)$ is positive. The denominator is a square and is also positive. Thus, $\\frac{dB}{dp_0} > 0$.\nThis shows that $B$ is a monotonically increasing function of $p_0$. The maximum value of $B$, denoted $B_{\\text{max}}$, will occur at the maximum possible value of $p_0$, which is $p_0 = \\frac{1}{RR_{UZ}}$. At this point, $p_1 = RR_{UZ} \\times \\frac{1}{RR_{UZ}} = 1$.\n\nSubstituting $p_0 = \\frac{1}{RR_{UZ}}$ and $p_1=1$ into the expression for $B$:\n$$B_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{1 + 1 \\cdot (RR_{UY}-1)}{1 + \\frac{1}{RR_{UZ}}(RR_{UY}-1)} = \\frac{RR_{UY}}{1 + \\frac{RR_{UY}-1}{RR_{UZ}}} = \\frac{RR_{UY} RR_{UZ}}{RR_{UZ} + RR_{UY} - 1}$$\nThis is the maximal multiplicative confounding factor. Now we substitute the given values $RR_{UY} = 2.0$ and $RR_{UZ} = 2.0$:\n$$B_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 2.0}{2.0 + 2.0 - 1} = \\frac{4.0}{3.0} = \\frac{4}{3}$$\n\nNext, we use this to compute the bias-adjusted vaccine effectiveness, $VE_{\\text{adj}}$.\nFirst, we find the observed risk ratio $RR_{\\text{obs}}$ from the given observed effectiveness $VE_{\\text{obs}} = 0.3$:\n$$RR_{\\text{obs}} = 1 - VE_{\\text{obs}} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$$\nThe adjusted risk ratio $RR_{\\text{adj}}$ is found by removing the maximal confounding bias from $RR_{\\text{obs}}$:\n$$RR_{\\text{adj}} = \\frac{RR_{\\text{obs}}}{B_{\\text{max}}} = \\frac{0.7}{4/3} = \\frac{7/10}{4/3} = \\frac{7}{10} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{21}{40}$$\n$$RR_{\\text{adj}} = 0.525$$\nFinally, the bias-adjusted vaccine effectiveness is:\n$$VE_{\\text{adj}} = 1 - RR_{\\text{adj}} = 1 - 0.525 = 0.475$$\nThe confounding by high-exposure risk being more prevalent in the vaccinated group biased the observed effectiveness downwards.

We find the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(K-\\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} R_{0}(1-c) - \\lambda & R_{0}(1-c)(1-VE_{i}) \\\\ R_{0}c(1-VE_{s}) & R_{0}c(1-VE_{s})(1-VE_{i}) - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\n$$ (R_{0}(1-c) - \\lambda)(R_{0}c(1-VE_{s})(1-VE_{i}) - \\lambda) - [R_{0}(1-c)(1-VE_{i})][R_{0}c(1-VE_{s})] = 0 $$\nExpanding this equation:\n$$ \\lambda^2 - \\lambda [R_{0}(1-c) + R_{0}c(1-VE_{s})(1-VE_{i})] + R_{0}^2(1-c)c(1-VE_{s})(1-VE_{i}) - R_{0}^2(1-c)c(1-VE_{s})(1-VE_{i}) = 0 $$\nThe constant terms cancel, simplifying the equation to:\n$$ \\lambda^2 - \\lambda [R_{0}(1-c) + R_{0}c(1-VE_{s})(1-VE_{i})] = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda \\left( \\lambda - R_{0}[(1-c) + c(1-VE_{s})(1-VE_{i})] \\right) = 0 $$\nThe two eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 0$ and $\\lambda_2 = R_{0}[(1-c) + c(1-VE_{s})(1-VE_{i})]$. The spectral radius is the larger of these two, so the expression for $R_{e}$ is:\n$$ R_{e} = R_{0} \\left[ (1-c) + c(1-VE_{s})(1-VE_{i}) \\right] $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $R_{0} = 3$, $c = 0.6$, $VE_{s} = 0.7$, and $VE_{i} = 0.3$.\n$$ R_{e} = 3 \\times \\left[ (1 - 0.6) + 0.6 \\times (1 - 0.7) \\times (1 - 0.3) \\right] $$\n$$ R_{e} = 3 \\times \\left[ 0.4 + 0.6 \\times (0.3) \\times (0.7) \\right] $$\n$$ R_{e} = 3 \\times \\left[ 0.4 + 0.18 \\times 0.7 \\right] $$\n$$ R_{e} = 3 \\times \\left[ 0.4 + 0.126 \\right] $$\n$$ R_{e} = 3 \\times 0.526 $$\n$$ R_{e} = 1.578 $$\nThe result $1.578$ has four significant figures as required.\n\nFinally, we determine if epidemic growth is sustained. Growth is sustained if $R_{e} > 1$.\nSince $R_{e} = 1.578$, which is greater than $1$, epidemic growth is sustained. Therefore, the parameter $g$ is equal to $1$.\nThe requested result is the two-entry row matrix $(R_{e}, g)$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1.578 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4647103"}]}
