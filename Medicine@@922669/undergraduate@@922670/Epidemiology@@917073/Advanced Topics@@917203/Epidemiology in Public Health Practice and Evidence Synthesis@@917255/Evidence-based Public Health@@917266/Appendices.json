The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nLet $Y_{ij}$ denote the outcome for the $j$-th individual in the $i$-th cluster, for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, k$ (where $k$ is the number of clusters) and $j = 1, 2, \\dots, m$. The total sample size is $N = km$.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following properties for the random variables $Y_{ij}$:\n1.  The marginal variance is constant: $\\text{Var}(Y_{ij}) = \\sigma^2$ for all $i, j$.\n2.  The intraclass correlation coefficient is $\\rho$. By definition, for any two distinct individuals $j \\neq j'$ in the same cluster $i$, the correlation is $\\text{Corr}(Y_{ij}, Y_{ij'}) = \\rho$. This implies the covariance is $\\text{Cov}(Y_{ij}, Y_{ij'}) = \\rho \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(Y_{ij})\\text{Var}(Y_{ij'})} = \\rho \\sigma^2$.\n3.  Individuals from different clusters $i \\neq i'$ are independent, so their covariance is zero: $\\text{Cov}(Y_{ij}, Y_{i'j'}) = 0$ for $i \\neq i'$.\n\nThe overall sample mean, $\\bar{Y}$, is given by:\n$$ \\bar{Y} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} Y_{ij} $$\nWe must first find the variance of this sample mean under the clustered design, $\\text{Var}_{\\text{CRT}}(\\bar{Y})$.\n$$ \\text{Var}_{\\text{CRT}}(\\bar{Y}) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} Y_{ij}\\right) = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} Y_{ij}\\right) $$\nThe variance of a sum of random variables is the sum of all their pairwise covariances:\n$$ \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} Y_{ij}\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\sum_{i'=1}^{k} \\sum_{j'=1}^{m} \\text{Cov}(Y_{ij}, Y_{i'j'}) $$\nWe can partition the $N^2$ terms in this quadruple summation into three cases:\n1.  **Same individual**: $(i, j) = (i', j')$. There are $N$ such terms. The covariance is $\\text{Cov}(Y_{ij}, Y_{ij}) = \\text{Var}(Y_{ij}) = \\sigma^2$. The sum for these terms is $N\\sigma^2$.\n2.  **Different individuals, same cluster**: $i = i'$ and $j \\neq j'$. In each of the $k$ clusters, there are $m$ individuals, so there are $m(m-1)$ ordered pairs of distinct individuals. The total number of such pairs across all clusters is $k \\cdot m(m-1)$. The covariance for each such pair is $\\rho\\sigma^2$. The sum for these terms is $k m (m-1) \\rho\\sigma^2$.\n3.  **Different clusters**: $i \\neq i'$.

To eliminate $R_1$ from the expression, we use the definition $RR = R_1/R_0$, which implies $R_1 = RR \\cdot R_0$. Substituting this for $R_1$ in the denominator gives the exact algebraic relationship:\n$$OR = RR \\left(\\frac{1-R_0}{1 - (RR \\cdot R_0)}\\right)$$\n\n**Part 2: Explanation of the Rare Outcome Approximation ($OR \\approx RR$)**\n\nThe rare outcome (or rare disease) approximation states that when the risk of the outcome is small in both the exposed and unexposed groups, the Odds Ratio is a good approximation of the Risk Ratio.\n\nA first-order argument for this approximation is grounded in the behavior of the odds function, $O(R) = R/(1-R)$, for small values of risk $R$. We can analyze this using a Taylor series expansion of $O(R)$ around $R=0$:\n$$O(R) = R(1-R)^{-1} = R(1 + R + R^2 + R^3 + \\dots) = R + R^2 + O(R^3)$$\nFor a very small risk, i.e., $R \\ll 1$, the higher-order terms ($R^2, R^3, \\dots$) are negligible. The first-order approximation is therefore:\n$$O(R) \\approx R$$\nWhen the outcome is rare, the risks in both groups are small: $R_1 \\ll 1$ and $R_0 \\ll 1$. Applying the first-order approximation to both groups:\n$$O_1 \\approx R_1$$\n$$O_0 \\approx R_0$$\nNow, we consider the definitions of $OR$ and $RR$:\n$$OR = \\frac{O_1}{O_0} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad RR = \\frac{R_1}{R_0}$$\nSubstituting the approximations for the odds, we find:\n$$OR = \\frac{O_1}{O_0} \\approx \\frac{R_1}{R_0} = RR$$\nThus, under the rare outcome condition, $OR \\approx RR$. The magnitude of the error in this approximation depends on the magnitude of the risks $R_0$ and $R_1$. As the risks increase, the approximation becomes less accurate, which is what we will quantify next.\n\n**Part 3: Quantification of Deviation from the Approximation**\n\nUsing the provided cohort data, we first compute the risks and the measures of association.\n- Risk in the vaccinated group: $R_1 = \\frac{144}{1200} = 0.12$.\n- Risk in the unvaccinated group: $R_0 = \\frac{160}{800} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.20$.\nThese risks, at $12\\%$ and $20\\%$, are not rare, so we expect a notable difference between the $OR$ and $RR$.\n\n- Risk Ratio ($RR$):\n$$RR = \\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{0.12}{0.20} = \\frac{12}{20} = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6$$\n\n- Odds Ratio ($OR$):\n$$OR = \\frac{ad}{bc} = \\frac{144 \\times 640}{1056 \\times 160} = \\frac{144}{160} \\times \\frac{640}{1056} = \\frac{9}{10} \\times \\frac{20}{33} = \\frac{9 \\times 2}{33} = \\frac{18}{33} = \\frac{6}{11}$$\nVerifying with the derived formula:\n$$OR = RR \\left(\\frac{1-R_0}{1-RR \\cdot R_0}\\right) = 0.6 \\left(\\frac{1-0.20}{1 - 0.6 \\cdot 0.20}\\right) = 0.6 \\left(\\frac{0.8}{1 - 0.12}\\right) = 0.6 \\left(\\frac{0.8}{0.88}\\right) = \\frac{6}{10} \\left(\\frac{80}{88}\\right) = \\frac{6}{10} \\left(\\frac{10}{11}\\right) = \\frac{6}{11}$$\nThe calculation is consistent.\n\nFinally, we compute the absolute relative error between $OR$ and $RR$:\n$$ \\text{Error} = \\frac{|OR - RR|}{RR} $$\nWe have $OR = 6/11$ and $RR = 0.6 = 3/5 = 6/10$.\n$$ |OR - RR| = \\left|\\frac{6}{11} - \\frac{6}{10}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{60 - 66}{110}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{-6}{110}\\right| = \\frac{6}{110} = \\frac{3}{55} $$\nNow, we compute the relative error:\n$$ \\text{Error} = \\frac{3/55}{RR} = \\frac{3/55}{6/10} = \\frac{3}{55} \\times \\frac{10}{6} = \\frac{30}{330} = \\frac{1}{11} $$\nTo express this as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures:\n$$ \\frac{1}{11} = 0.09090909\\dots \\approx 0.09091 $$\nThe relative error is approximately $9.1\\%$, which confirms that for a common outcome, the $OR$ deviates substantially from the $RR$.

By deriving the formula for the E-value, you will learn to calculate the minimum strength of association an unmeasured confounder must have with both the exposure and the outcome to explain away an observed risk ratio, providing a crucial tool for appraising the strength of causal claims [@problem_id:4592635].", "problem": "An observational evaluation of a city-wide regulation that bans the sale of sugar-sweetened beverages in schools reports an observed risk ratio (RR) for incident obesity comparing students in regulated versus unregulated schools equal to $RR_{\\mathrm{obs}}=R$, where $R \\ge 1$.

The problem asks for the derivation of the E-value, a standard metric in sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding, based on its definition and a sharp bound on confounding bias.\n\nThe derivation proceeds as follows.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in quantifying the maximum amount of bias that an unmeasured confounder $U$ can induce. The problem states we can start from a \"well-tested multiplicative sharp bound on confounding bias\". For a binary exposure $E$, binary outcome $Y$, and a binary (or categorical) unmeasured confounder $U$, the relationship between the observed risk ratio, $RR_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, and the true causal risk ratio, $RR_{\\mathrm{true}}$, is bounded. The bias factor, defined as $\\frac{RR_{\\mathrm{obs}}}{RR_{\\mathrm{true}}}$, is bounded by a function of the confounder-exposure and confounder-outcome associations. A sharp bound for this bias factor is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{RR_{\\mathrm{obs}}}{RR_{\\mathrm{true}}} \\le \\frac{RR_{EU} \\cdot RR_{UY}}{RR_{EU} + RR_{UY} - 1}\n$$\nwhere $RR_{EU}=\\sup_{u,u'} \\frac{P(E=1 \\mid U=u)}{P(E=1 \\mid U=u')}$ and $RR_{UY}=\\max\\!\\left\\{\\sup_{u,u'} \\frac{P(Y=1 \\mid E=1, U=u)}{P(Y=1 \\mid E=1, U=u')},\\ \\sup_{u,u'} \\frac{P(Y=1 \\mid E=0, U=u)}{P(Y=1 \\mid E=0, U=u')}\\right\\}$. By definition, risk ratios are non-negative, and in this context, we consider associations that increase risk, so $RR_{EU} \\ge 1$ and $RR_{UY} \\ge 1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the conditions under which an unmeasured confounder could \"fully explain away an observed association\". This corresponds to the scenario where the true causal risk ratio is null, i.e., $RR_{\\mathrm{true}} = 1$. The observed risk ratio is given as $RR_{\\mathrm{obs}} = R$, where $R \\ge 1$. Substituting these values into the inequality gives the condition that must be met for a confounder with parameters $RR_{EU}$ and $RR_{UY}$ to be capable of producing the observed association from a true null effect:\n$$\nR \\le \\frac{RR_{EU} \\cdot RR_{UY}}{RR_{EU} + RR_{UY} - 1}\n$$\n\nThe E-value, which we will denote as $E(R)$, is defined as the minimal common strength $r$ such that an unmeasured confounder with associations bounded by $r$ (i.e., $RR_{EU} \\le r$ and $RR_{UY} \\le r$) could satisfy the above inequality. To find the minimal required strength $r$, we must consider the most adversarial scenario, which is the one that produces the maximum possible bias for a given strength. The bias term on the right-hand side of the inequality is an increasing function of both $RR_{EU}$ and $RR_{UY}$ (for values $\\ge 1$). Therefore, to check if a strength $r$ is sufficient, we must test against the maximum possible values, which are $RR_{EU} = r$ and $RR_{UY} = r$.\n\nSubstituting $RR_{EU} = r$ and $RR_{UY} = r$ into the condition yields:\n$$\nR \\le \\frac{r^2}{2r - 1}\n$$\nThe E-value is the minimum value of $r \\ge 1$ that satisfies this inequality. To find this minimum value, we can solve the corresponding equality, which represents the boundary case:\n$$\nR = \\frac{r^2}{2r - 1}\n$$\nWe now solve this equation for $r$ in terms of $R$. Since we are interested in $r \\ge 1$, the denominator $2r - 1$ is positive (for $r > 1/2$), so we can multiply both sides by it without changing any inequality direction:\n$$\nR(2r - 1) = r^2\n$$\n$$\n2Rr - R = r^2\n$$\nRearranging this into a standard quadratic form $ar^2+br+c=0$ with respect to the variable $r$:\n$$\nr^2 - 2Rr + R = 0\n$$\nWe can solve for $r$ using the quadratic formula, $r = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with coefficients $a=1$, $b=-2R$, and $c=R$:\n$$\nr = \\frac{-(-2R) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2R)^2 - 4(1)(R)}}{2(1)}\n$$\n$$\nr = \\frac{2R \\pm \\sqrt{4R^2 - 4R}}{2}\n$$\n$$\nr = \\frac{2R \\pm \\sqrt{4(R^2 - R)}}{2}\n$$\n$$\nr = \\frac{2R \\pm 2\\sqrt{R^2 - R}}{2}\n$$\n$$\nr = R \\pm \\sqrt{R^2 - R}\n$$\nThis gives two potential solutions for $r$:\n$r_1 = R + \\sqrt{R^2 - R}$\n$r_2 = R - \\sqrt{R^2 - R}$\n\nBy definition, the strength parameter $r$ must be a risk ratio and thus must satisfy $r \\ge 1$. We must check which of these solutions is valid.\nThe problem states $R \\ge 1$.\nIf $R = 1$, then $\\sqrt{R^2 - R} = 0$, and both roots are $r_1 = r_2 = 1$. This is a valid solution.\nIf $R > 1$, then $R^2 - R > 0$. Consider the second root, $r_2 = R - \\sqrt{R^2 - R}$. Let's test if $r_2 \\ge 1$:\n$R - \\sqrt{R^2 - R} \\ge 1 \\iff R - 1 \\ge \\sqrt{R^2 - R}$.\nSince $R > 1$, both sides of the inequality are positive, so we can square them:\n$(R - 1)^2 \\ge R^2 - R$\n$R^2 - 2R + 1 \\ge R^2 - R$\n$1 \\ge R$\nThis contradicts our assumption that $R > 1$. Therefore, for any $R > 1$, the root $r_2 = R - \\sqrt{R^2 - R}$ is less than $1$ and is not a valid strength parameter for a confounder risk ratio.\n\nThe first root, $r_1 = R + \\sqrt{R^2 - R}$, is clearly greater than $R$, and since $R>1$, we have $r_1 > 1$. Thus, this is the only valid physical solution for $r$ when $R > 1$.\n\nThe inequality we seek to satisfy is $R \\le \\frac{r^2}{2r - 1}$, which is equivalent to $r^2 - 2Rr + R \\ge 0$ for $r \\ge 1$. The quadratic function $f(r) = r^2 - 2Rr + R$ is a parabola opening upwards. It is non-negative for values of $r$ outside its roots, i.e., for $r \\ge r_1$ or $r \\le r_2$. Since we require $r \\ge 1$ and we have shown $r_2  1$ (for $R>1$), the valid solution set is $r \\ge r_1 = R + \\sqrt{R^2 - R}$.\n\nThe E-value is defined as the *minimal* value of $r$ that satisfies this condition. The minimum value in the set $[R + \\sqrt{R^2 - R}, \\infty)$ is precisely its lower bound.\nTherefore, the E-value is:\n$$\nE(R) = R + \\sqrt{R^2 - R}\n$$\nThis expression quantifies the minimum strength of association that an unmeasured confounder must have with both the exposure and the outcome, on the risk ratio scale, to fully explain away an observed risk ratio of $R$. For an observed $RR_{\\mathrm{obs}}=R$, if no unmeasured confounder $U$ exists that has an association of at least $E(R)$ with both $E$ and $Y$, then the observed association cannot be entirely attributed to confounding by $U$. It provides a quantitative threshold for the plausibility of unmeasured confounding as a complete explanation for an observed effect.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{R + \\sqrt{R^2 - R}}\n$$", "id": "4592635"}]}
