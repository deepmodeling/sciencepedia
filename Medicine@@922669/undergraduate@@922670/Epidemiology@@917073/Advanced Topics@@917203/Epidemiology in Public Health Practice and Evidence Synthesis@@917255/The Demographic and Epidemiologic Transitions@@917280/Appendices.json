This means that even if this country immediately adopted the low birth and death rates of a Stage $4$ society, its population would continue to grow. This is because the young age structure, a legacy of past high fertility, contains a large proportion of people in the low-mortality age groups and a large cohort of women in their childbearing years. The resulting CDR is very low, and births still outnumber deaths. This \"built-in\" tendency for a young population to continue growing for several generations, even after fertility rates fall, is the essence of population momentum.
