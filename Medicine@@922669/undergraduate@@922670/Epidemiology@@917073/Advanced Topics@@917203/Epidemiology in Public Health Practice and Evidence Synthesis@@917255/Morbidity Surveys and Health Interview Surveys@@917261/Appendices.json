For each stratum $i$, the survey estimated the age-specific prevalence $p_i$ of hypertension. To enable comparison across populations with different age structures, epidemiologists often perform direct age standardization by asking: what proportion of individuals would be hypertensive if the stratum-specific prevalences observed in the study were applied to the age structure of a chosen standard population?\n\nUse the following data:\n- Age-specific prevalences from the survey: $p_1 = 0.06$ (ages $18$-$29$), $p_2 = 0.12$ (ages $30$-$44$), $p_3 = 0.27$ (ages $45$-$59$), $p_4 = 0.46$ (ages $60$-$74$), $p_5 = 0.58$ (ages $\\geq 75$).\n- World Health Organization (WHO) standard adult population vector for these strata, normalized to sum to $1$: $w_1 = 0.33$, $w_2 = 0.28$, $w_3 = 0.20$, $w_4 = 0.14$, $w_5 = 0.05$.\n\nStarting from the definition of prevalence and the principle of direct standardization as the expected proportion of cases when applying stratum-specific prevalences to a fixed standard age distribution, compute the directly standardized prevalence of hypertension for this survey using the provided World Health Organization (WHO) standard population vector.

We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of a directly standardized prevalence. Direct age standardization is a method used to adjust for the confounding effect of age, allowing for the comparison of prevalence or incidence rates between populations with different underlying age structures. The core principle is to calculate a weighted average of the age-specific rates or prevalences from the study population, where the weights are derived from the age distribution of a standard population.\n\nLet $i$ be the index for the age strata, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\nThe age-specific prevalence for each stratum $i$ in the study population is denoted by $p_i$.\nThe proportion of individuals in each stratum $i$ in the standard population is denoted by the weight $w_i$. The standard population weights are normalized such that $\\sum_{i} w_i = 1$.\n\nThe directly standardized prevalence, denoted as $P_{std}$, is formally defined as the expected prevalence if the study population had the same age structure as the standard population. It is calculated by the formula:\n$$P_{std} = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} w_i p_i$$\n\nThe given data are:\nAge-specific prevalences from the survey:\n$p_1 = 0.06$ for ages $18$-$29$\n$p_2 = 0.12$ for ages $30$-$44$\n$p_3 = 0.27$ for ages $45$-$59$\n$p_4 = 0.46$ for ages $60$-$74$\n$p_5 = 0.58$ for ages $\\geq 75$\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) standard population weights:\n$w_1 = 0.33$\n$w_2 = 0.28$\n$w_3 = 0.20$\n$w_4 = 0.14$\n$w_5 = 0.05$\n\nWe can verify that the weights sum to unity:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{5} w_i = 0.33 + 0.28 + 0.20 + 0.14 + 0.05 = 1.00$.\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into the formula for the standardized prevalence:\n$$P_{std} = w_1 p_1 + w_2 p_2 + w_3 p_3 + w_4 p_4 + w_5 p_5$$\n$$P_{std} = (0.33)(0.06) + (0.28)(0.12) + (0.20)(0.27) + (0.14)(0.46) + (0.05)(0.58)$$\n\nWe calculate each term individually:\nThe contribution from the first stratum ($18$-$29$ years) is $0.33 \\times 0.06 = 0.0198$.\nThe contribution from the second stratum ($30$-$44$ years) is $0.28 \\times 0.12 = 0.0336$.\nThe contribution from the third stratum ($45$-$59$ years) is $0.20 \\times 0.27 = 0.0540$.\nThe contribution from the fourth stratum ($60$-$74$ years) is $0.14 \\times 0.46 = 0.0644$.\nThe contribution from the fifth stratum ($\\geq 75$ years) is $0.05 \\times 0.58 = 0.0290$.\n\nSumming these contributions gives the standardized prevalence:\n$$P_{std} = 0.0198 + 0.0336 + 0.0540 + 0.0644 + 0.0290$$\n$$P_{std} = 0.2008$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal proportion rounded to $4$ significant figures. The calculated value of $0.2008$ has exactly four significant figures (the digits $2$, $0$, $0$, and $8$).

We can therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $p$ be the true prevalence of hypertension, defined as $p = \\mathbb{P}(D=1)$, where $D=1$ indicates the true disease status. The observed proportion of self-reported hypertension is $p_{obs} = \\mathbb{P}(Y=1)$, where $Y=1$ indicates a self-report of the disease.

The given values are $Se = 0.80$, $Sp = 0.95$, and $p_{obs} = 0.28$.\n\nWe are tasked with deriving an expression for the true prevalence $p$ and computing its value. The derivation relies on the law of total probability, which allows us to express the overall probability of an event in terms of conditional probabilities given a partition of the sample space. Here, we partition the population based on the true disease status, $D=1$ (diseased) and $D=0$ (not diseased).\n\nThe observed proportion of self-reported hypertension, $p_{obs}$, can be expressed as:\n$$p_{obs} = \\mathbb{P}(Y=1)$$\nBy the law of total probability, we can expand this expression:\n$$p_{obs} = \\mathbb{P}(Y=1 \\mid D=1)\\mathbb{P}(D=1) + \\mathbb{P}(Y=1 \\mid D=0)\\mathbb{P}(D=0)$$\n\nWe can now substitute the defined epidemiological terms into this equation:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\mathbb{P}(D=1) = p$ (the true prevalence we seek to find).\n    \\item $\\mathbb{P}(D=0) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(D=1) = 1 - p$.\n    \\item $\\mathbb{P}(Y=1 \\mid D=1) = Se$ (the sensitivity).\n    \\item $\\mathbb{P}(Y=1 \\mid D=0)$ is the probability of a false positive.

Since the response $Y$ is binary, $\\mathbb{P}(Y=1 \\mid D=0) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(Y=0 \\mid D=0) = 1 - Sp$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nSubstituting these terms into the expanded equation for $p_{obs}$ gives the fundamental relationship between the observed proportion and the true prevalence:\n$$p_{obs} = (Se)(p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)$$\n\nThis equation contains our single unknown, $p$. We must now perform algebraic manipulation to solve for $p$.\n$$p_{obs} = p \\cdot Se + (1 - Sp) - p(1 - Sp)$$\n$$p_{obs} = p \\cdot Se + 1 - Sp - p + p \\cdot Sp$$\nGroup the terms containing $p$:\n$$p_{obs} = p(Se - 1 + Sp) + (1 - Sp)$$\nIsolate the term with $p$:\n$$p_{obs} - (1 - Sp) = p(Se + Sp - 1)$$\n$$p_{obs} + Sp - 1 = p(Se + Sp - 1)$$\nFinally, divide to solve for $p$, assuming $Se + Sp - 1 \\neq 0$. If $Se + Sp = 1$, the test is no better than a random guess, and the true prevalence cannot be identified from the observed data.\n$$p = \\frac{p_{obs} + Sp - 1}{Se + Sp - 1}$$\nThis is the general expression for the true prevalence $p$ in terms of the observed proportion $p_{obs}$, sensitivity $Se$, and specificity $Sp$.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression: $p_{obs} = 0.28$, $Se = 0.80$, and $Sp = 0.95$.\n$$p = \\frac{0.28 + 0.95 - 1}{0.80 + 0.95 - 1}$$\n$$p = \\frac{0.23}{0.75}$$\n$$p = \\frac{23}{75}$$\nAs a decimal, this is $p \\approx 0.30666...$. The problem requires rounding to four significant figures.\n$$p \\approx 0.3067$$\n\nFinally, we interpret the result. The corrected prevalence, $p \\approx 0.3067$, is higher than the observed self-reported proportion, $p_{obs} = 0.28$. The direction of the bias (i.e., whether the observed prevalence is an over- or underestimate) depends on the balance between two types of misclassification: false positives and false negatives.\n\n1.  A **false negative** occurs when a person with hypertension is not identified ($Y=0$ given $D=1$). The rate is $1 - Se = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$.\n2.  A **false positive** occurs when a person without hypertension is incorrectly identified as having it ($Y=1$ given $D=0$). The rate is $1 - Sp = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n\nThe observed prevalence is an underestimate of the true prevalence because the total number of false negatives in the population outweighs the total number of false positives. We can verify this using our estimated true prevalence $p \\approx 0.3067$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Proportion of false negatives in the total population: $\\mathbb{P}(Y=0, D=1) = (1-Se)p = 0.20 \\times 0.3067 \\approx 0.0613$.\n    \\item Proportion of false positives in the total population: $\\mathbb{P}(Y=1, D=0) = (1-Sp)(1-p) = 0.05 \\times (1 - 0.3067) = 0.05 \\times 0.6933 \\approx 0.0347$.\n\\end{itemize}\nSince the proportion of the population that are false negatives ($\\approx6.1\\%$) is greater than the proportion that are false positives ($\\approx3.5\\%$), more cases of hypertension are being missed by the survey than are being incorrectly added. This leads to a net underestimation of the prevalence, which is why the corrected prevalence $p$ is higher than the observed proportion $p_{obs}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.3067}\n$$", "id": "4612212"}, {"introduction": "An accurate point estimate is only part of the story; to fully understand our survey results, we must also quantify their precision, typically by constructing a confidence interval.
