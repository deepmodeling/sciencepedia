I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Computation\n\nThe problem requires a solution built from first principles.\n\n**1. Inverse-Variance Weights ($w_i$)**\n\nThe model assumes that the variance of the $i$-th study's estimate $y_i$ is $s_i^2$. Inverse-variance weighting assigns a weight $w_i$ to each study that is inversely proportional to its variance. This method gives more weight to more precise studies (those with smaller variances).\n\nThe weight for the $i$-th study is defined as:\n$$w_i = \\frac{1}{s_i^2}$$\nFirst, we compute the variances $s_i^2$ from the given standard errors $s_i$:\n-   $s_1^2 = (0.10)^2 = 0.0100$\n-   $s_2^2 = (0.12)^2 = 0.0144$\n-   $s_3^2 = (0.20)^2 = 0.0400$\n-   $s_4^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225$\n-   $s_5^2 = (0.18)^2 = 0.0324$\n\nNext, we calculate the inverse-variance weights $w_i$:\n-   $w_1 = \\frac{1}{0.0100} = 100.0$\n-   $w_2 = \\frac{1}{0.0144} \\approx 69.4444$\n-   $w_3 = \\frac{1}{0.0400} = 25.0$\n-   $w_4 = \\frac{1}{0.0225} \\approx 44.4444$\n-   $w_5 = \\frac{1}{0.0324} \\approx 30.8642$\n\nWe will retain precision for intermediate calculations.\n\n**2. Fixed-Effect Pooled Estimator ($\\hat{\\mu}$)**\n\nThe problem specifies that the pooled estimator $\\hat{\\mu}$ is the value of the common effect $\\mu$ that minimizes the weighted sum of squared deviations (WSS). Let the WSS be a function of $\\mu$:\n$$S(\\mu) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i (y_i - \\mu)^2$$\nTo find the minimum, we differentiate $S(\\mu)$ with respect to $\\mu$ and set the derivative to zero:\n$$\\frac{dS}{d\\mu} = \\frac{d}{d\\mu} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i (y_i - \\mu)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i \\cdot 2(y_i - \\mu) \\cdot (-1) = -2 \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i (y_i - \\mu)$$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find the estimator $\\hat{\\mu}$:\n$$-2 \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i (y_i - \\hat{\\mu}) = 0$$\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i y_i - \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i \\hat{\\mu} = 0$$\n$$\\hat{\\mu} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i y_i$$\n$$\\hat{\\mu} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i y_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i}$$\nThis derived estimator is the weighted mean of the study-specific effects.\n\nNow, we compute the necessary sums:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^5 w_i = 100.0 + 69.4444... + 25.0 + 44.4444... + 30.8642... \\approx 269.753086$\n$\\sum_{i=1}^5 w_i y_i = (100.0 \\times 0.2) + (69.4444... \\times 0.4) + (25.0 \\times 0.1) + (44.4444... \\times 0.3) + (30.8642... \\times 0.0)$\n$\\sum_{i=1}^5 w_i y_i = 20.0 + 27.7777... + 2.5 + 13.3333... + 0.0 \\approx 63.611111$\n\nNow, we compute $\\hat{\\mu}$:\n$$\\hat{\\mu} = \\frac{63.611111}{269.753086} \\approx 0.235812$$\n\n**3. Cochran’s Q Statistic**\n\nCochran's $Q$ is defined as the minimized weighted sum of squared deviations, evaluated at $\\mu = \\hat{\\mu}$:\n$$Q = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i (y_i - \\hat{\\mu})^2$$\nUsing $\\hat{\\mu} \\approx 0.235812$:\n-   $w_1(y_1 - \\hat{\\mu})^2 = 100.0 \\times (0.2 - 0.235812)^2 \\approx 100.0 \\times (-0.035812)^2 \\approx 0.12825$\n-   $w_2(y_2 - \\hat{\\mu})^2 = 69.4444 \\times (0.4 - 0.235812)^2 \\approx 69.4444 \\times (0.164188)^2 \\approx 1.87211$\n-   $w_3(y_3 - \\hat{\\mu})^2 = 25.0 \\times (0.1 - 0.235812)^2 \\approx 25.0 \\times (-0.135812)^2 \\approx 0.46112$\n-   $w_4(y_4 - \\hat{\\mu})^2 = 44.4444 \\times (0.3 - 0.235812)^2 \\approx 44.4444 \\times (0.064188)^2 \\approx 0.18312$\n-   $w_5(y_5 - \\hat{\\mu})^2 = 30.8642 \\times (0.0 - 0.235812)^2 \\approx 30.8642 \\times (-0.235812)^2 \\approx 1.71620$\n\nSumming these values gives $Q$:\n$$Q \\approx 0.12825 + 1.87211 + 0.46112 + 0.18312 + 1.71620 = 4.3608$$\n\n**4. Hypothesis Test for Homogeneity**\n\nThe null hypothesis, $H_0$, is that of homogeneity: all studies are estimating the same true effect, $\\mu$. Under $H_0$, the $Q$ statistic follows a chi-squared ($\\chi^2$) distribution. The degrees of freedom ($df$) are equal to the number of studies, $k$, minus the number of parameters estimated from the data to define the expected values, which in this case is one parameter ($\\hat{\\mu}$).\n$$df = k - 1$$\nFor this problem, $k=5$, so the degrees of freedom are $df = 5 - 1 = 4$.\nThe test compares the observed value of $Q$ to the critical value from the $\\chi^2$ distribution with $4$ degrees of freedom at the chosen significance level $\\alpha=0.05$.\nThe critical value $\\chi^2_{0.05, 4}$ is $9.488$.\nSince our observed statistic $Q_{obs} \\approx 4.3608$ is less than the critical value of $9.488$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis $H_0$. There is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that heterogeneity exists among the study effects.\n\n**5. $I^2$ Statistic**\n\nThe $I^2$ statistic quantifies the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance). It is derived from the $Q$ statistic.\nThe expected value of $Q$ under homogeneity is its degrees of freedom, $df = k-1$. The excess variation, $Q - (k-1)$, is an estimate of the component due to between-study heterogeneity. The $I^2$ statistic expresses this excess variation as a proportion of the total variation (represented by $Q$).\nThe formula is:\n$$I^2 = \\frac{Q - df}{Q}$$\nIf $Q < df$, the value would be negative, which is not sensible for a proportion. In such cases, $I^2$ is defined to be $0$. Therefore,\n$$I^2 = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{Q - (k-1)}{Q}\\right)$$\nUsing our calculated values:\n-   $Q \\approx 4.3608$\n-   $df = k-1 = 4$\nSince $Q > df$, the formula is directly applicable without truncation.\n$$I^2 = \\frac{4.3608 - 4}{4.3608} = \\frac{0.3608}{4.3608} \\approx 0.082739$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe value $0.082739...$ rounded to four significant figures is $0.08274$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.08274}$$", "id": "4598420"}, {"introduction": "A summary statistic like $I^2$ tells us the extent of heterogeneity, but not its source.

The pooled estimate is again a weighted average, but the weights, $w_i^*$, now incorporate both the within-study variance ($s_i^2$) and the between-study variance ($\\tau^2=0.02$).\n\nThe random-effects weights, $w_i^*=1/(s_i^2 + \\tau^2)$, are calculated using the total variance for each study:\n$v_1^* = s_1^2 + \\tau^2 = 0.01 + 0.02 = 0.03$\n$v_2^* = s_2^2 + \\tau^2 = 0.01 + 0.02 = 0.03$\n$v_3^* = s_3^2 + \\tau^2 = 0.04 + 0.02 = 0.06$\n$v_4^* = s_4^2 + \\tau^2 = 0.0025 + 0.02 = 0.0225$\n\nThe weights are:\n$w_1^* = 1/0.03 = 100/3$\n$w_2^* = 1/0.03 = 100/3$\n$w_3^* = 1/0.06 = 50/3$\n$w_4^* = 1/0.0225 = 400/9$\n\nThe sum of the random-effects weights is $\\sum_{i=1}^{4} w_i^* = \\frac{100}{3} + \\frac{100}{3} + \\frac{50}{3} + \\frac{400}{9} = \\frac{300+300+150+400}{9} = \\frac{1150}{9}$.\n\nThe random-effects pooled estimate, $\\hat{\\mu}_{\\text{RE}}$, is calculated as:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mu}_{\\text{RE}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{4} w_i^* y_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{4} w_i^*}\n$$\nThe numerator is $\\sum w_i^* y_i = (\\frac{100}{3})(0.3) + (\\frac{100}{3})(0.1) + (\\frac{50}{3})(0.0) + (\\frac{400}{9})(0.4) = 10 + \\frac{10}{3} + 0 + \\frac{160}{9} = \\frac{90+30+160}{9} = \\frac{280}{9}$.\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\hat{\\mu}_{\\text{RE}} = \\frac{280/9}{1150/9} = \\frac{280}{1150} = \\frac{28}{115}\n$$\nNumerically, $\\hat{\\mu}_{\\text{RE}} \\approx 0.243478...$\n\nThe substantial heterogeneity ($I^2=70\\%$) is consistent with the difference observed between the two pooled estimates. In the fixed-effect model, the weights are solely determined by study precision ($1/s_i^2$). Study $4$ ($s_4=0.05$) is the most precise and receives a weight of $w_4=400$, which is $64\\%$ of the total weight ($\\sum w_i=625$). This large study, with a high estimate ($y_4=0.4$), strongly influences the fixed-effect estimate, pulling it up to $\\hat{\\mu}_{\\text{FE}}=0.32$.\nIn the random-effects model, the constant between-study variance $\\tau^2$ is added to each $s_i^2$. This addition has a larger proportional impact on the smaller variances, making the total variances $v_i^*$ more similar to each other. Consequently, the weights $w_i^*$ are more evenly distributed. Study $4$'s weight becomes $w_4^* \\approx 44.44$, which is only about $34.8\\%$ of the total weight ($\\sum w_i^* \\approx 127.78$). Smaller studies (e.g., study $3$ with $y_3=0.0$ and $s_3=0.2$) gain relative influence. As the random-effects model gives more weight to the studies with smaller effect estimates ($y_2=0.1, y_3=0.0$), the resulting pooled estimate $\\hat{\\mu}_{\\text{RE}}$ is pulled downward, away from the estimate of the dominant large study.\n\nThe shift $\\Delta$ is the difference between the random-effects and fixed-effect estimates:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\hat{\\mu}_{\\text{RE}} - \\hat{\\mu}_{\\text{FE}} = \\frac{28}{115} - 0.32 = \\frac{28}{115} - \\frac{8}{25} = \\frac{28 \\times 25 - 8 \\times 115}{115 \\times 25} = \\frac{700 - 920}{2875} = -\\frac{220}{2875} = -\\frac{44}{575}\n$$\nNumerically, $\\Delta \\approx -0.076521739...$\nRounding to four significant figures, the shift is $-0.07652$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.07652}$$", "id": "4598384"}]}
