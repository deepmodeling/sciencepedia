It presents a classic scenario of collider stratification bias, a fundamental concept in epidemiology and causal inference. All necessary data for a quantitative analysis are provided.\n\nThe problem asks us to analyze the association between a binary exposure $E$ and a binary outcome, disease severity $S$, within a subpopulation of hospitalized cases ($H=1$). In the source population, $E$ and $S$ are given to be independent. Hospitalization $H$ is a common effect of both $E$ and $S$. This relationship can be represented by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) as $E \\to H \\leftarrow S$. In such a structure, $H$ is known as a \"collider\" because two causal arrows \"collide\" at it.\n\nA fundamental rule of DAGs is that conditioning on a collider (or a descendant of a collider) can induce a statistical association between its parents, even if they are marginally independent. In this problem, the team analyzes only hospitalized cases, which is equivalent to conditioning on $H=1$. This action is expected to create a spurious, non-causal association between $E$ and $S$.\n\nWe are given the following probabilities for the source population:\n-   $P(E=1) = 0.5$, which implies $P(E=0) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$.\n-   $P(S=1) = 0.2$, which implies $P(S=0) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8$.\n-   By independence, $P(S=s, E=e) = P(S=s)P(E=e)$ for all $s, e$. This also means $P(S=s \\mid E=e) = P(S=s)$.\n\nThe probabilities of hospitalization are given conditional on $E$ and $S$:\n-   $P(H=1 \\mid S=1, E=1) = 0.95$\n-   $P(H=1 \\mid S=1, E=0) = 0.90$\n-   $P(H=1 \\mid S=0, E=1) = 0.30$\n-   $P(H=1 \\mid S=0, E=0) = 0.10$\n\nTo determine the association between $E$ and $S$ among hospitalized cases, we must compare the probability of severe disease ($S=1$) given hospitalization ($H=1$) for those with the exposure ($E=1$) versus those without ($E=0$). That is, we must compare $P(S=1 \\mid H=1, E=1)$ with $P(S=1 \\mid H=1, E=0)$.\n\nUsing Bayes' rule, we have:\n$$P(S=1 \\mid H=1, E=e) = \\frac{P(H=1 \\mid S=1, E=e) P(S=1 \\mid E=e)}{P(H=1 \\mid E=e)}$$\nSince $S$ and $E$ are independent, $P(S=1 \\mid E=e) = P(S=1) = 0.2$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the denominators, $P(H=1 \\mid E=1)$ and $P(H=1 \\mid E=0)$, using the law of total probability, marginalizing over $S$:\n$$P(H=1 \\mid E=e) = P(H=1 \\mid S=1, E=e)P(S=1 \\mid E=e) + P(H=1 \\mid S=0, E=e)P(S=0 \\mid E=e)$$\n$$P(H=1 \\mid E=e) = P(H=1 \\mid S=1, E=e)P(S=1) + P(H=1 \\mid S=0, E=e)P(S=0)$$\n\nFor $E=1$:\n$$P(H=1 \\mid E=1) = (0.95)(0.2) + (0.30)(0.8) = 0.19 + 0.24 = 0.43$$\n\nFor $E=0$:\n$$P(H=1 \\mid E=0) = (0.90)(0.2) + (0.10)(0.8) = 0.18 + 0.08 = 0.26$$\n\nNow we can compute the conditional probabilities of interest:\n\nFor individuals with the exposure ($E=1$) among the hospitalized:\n$$P(S=1 \\mid H=1, E=1) = \\frac{P(H=1 \\mid S=1, E=1) P(S=1)}{P(H=1 \\mid E=1)} = \\frac{(0.95)(0.2)}{0.43} = \\frac{0.19}{0.43} \\approx 0.4419$$\n\nFor individuals without the exposure ($E=0$) among the hospitalized:\n$$P(S=1 \\mid H=1, E=0) = \\frac{P(H=1 \\mid S=1, E=0) P(S=1)}{P(H=1 \\mid E=0)} = \\frac{(0.90)(0.2)}{0.26} = \\frac{0.18}{0.26} = \\frac{9}{13} \\approx 0.6923$$\n\nComparing these two probabilities, we see that $0.4419 < 0.6923$. Therefore, $P(S=1 \\mid H=1, E=1) < P(S=1 \\mid H=1, E=0)$. This demonstrates that conditioning on hospitalization ($H=1$) has induced a spurious negative association between the prophylaxis program ($E$) and disease severity ($S$). In the restricted sample, it appears that prophylaxis is associated with a lower risk of severe disease, which contradicts the fact that there is no such association in the source population. This is a classic example of collider bias, also known as selection bias.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. Because hospitalization $H$ is a common effect (collider) of exposure $E$ and severity $S$, conditioning on $H=1$ opens a non-causal path between $E$ and $S$, which can induce an association even when $E$ and $S$ are independent in the source population; with the given values, $P(S=1 \\mid H=1, E=1) < P(S=1 \\mid H=1, E=0)$.**\nThis statement accurately describes the causal structure ($H$ as a collider) and the consequence of conditioning on it (inducing an association by opening a non-causal path). The calculation performed above confirms the specific inequality $P(S=1 \\mid H=1, E=1) < P(S=1 \\mid H=1, E=0)$. The statement is entirely correct, both in its theoretical reasoning and its quantitative conclusion based on the provided data. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Conditioning on $H=1$ removes confounding by $S$, so the association between $E$ and $S$ among hospitalized cases is an unbiased estimate of the causal effect of $E$ on $S$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Hospitalization ($H$) is a collider, not a confounder of the $E-S$ relationship. A confounder would be a common cause of $E$ and $S$. Conditioning on a collider *induces* bias, it does not remove it. The resulting association is a biased estimate of the true causal effect (which is null in this case). **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Any association between $E$ and $S$ observed among hospitalized cases must be due to random error alone; selection based on $H=1$ cannot systematically induce associations.**\nThis statement is incorrect. As demonstrated by the principles of causal inference and our calculations, selection based on a common effect ($H=1$) systematically induces an association known as collider bias or selection bias. The observed association is a systematic artifact of the sampling strategy, not merely a result of random chance. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. A defensible step in an outbreak investigation to avoid this bias is to design case ascertainment to include both hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases or to explicitly model $P(H=1 \\mid E,S)$ and use inverse probability weighting, rather than conditioning on $H=1$.**\nThis statement proposes two valid strategies to deal with the identified collider bias. First, analyzing the entire population (both hospitalized and not) avoids conditioning on the collider $H$, thus no spurious association would be created. This would allow for an unbiased estimation of the (null) association between $E$ and $S$. Second, if analysis must be restricted to the selected sample, inverse probability of selection weighting (IPSW) is a standard statistical technique to correct for selection bias. By weighting each observation by the inverse of its probability of being selected ($1 / P(H=1 \\mid E, S)$), one can create a pseudo-population that is representative of the original source population, thereby removing the bias. Both suggestions are methodologically sound and widely used in epidemiology. **Correct**.\n\n**E. Matching cases and controls on hospitalization status ($H=1$) is sufficient to eliminate any bias arising from differential hospitalization probabilities by $E$ and $S$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The problem describes a study restricted to those with $H=1$. Matching cases (e.g., $S=1, H=1$) and controls (e.g., $S=0, H=1$) on their hospitalization status simply formalizes the conditioning on $H=1$. This procedure *is* the cause of the collider bias; it does not eliminate it. Matching is a technique used to control for confounding, but $H$ is not a confounder in this context. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "4637940"}]}
