## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the fundamental principles and mechanisms distinguishing the Intention-to-Treat (ITT) and Per-Protocol (PP) analytical approaches. The ITT principle, by analyzing all participants as randomized, preserves the prognostic balance achieved at baseline and provides an unbiased estimate of the causal effect of a treatment *policy* or *assignment*. In contrast, a Per-Protocol analysis seeks to estimate the effect of a treatment under conditions of perfect adherence, a laudable scientific goal that is fraught with methodological peril. By conditioning on post-randomization events—namely, adherence to the protocol—a naive PP analysis breaks the randomization, introduces selection bias, and risks producing misleading conclusions.

This chapter moves beyond these foundational concepts to explore the application of per-protocol analysis in diverse, real-world scientific contexts. Our objective is not to reiterate the core definitions but to demonstrate the utility, challenges, and interdisciplinary connections of PP analysis. We will see that the tension between ITT and PP is not merely a statistical debate but a recurring theme with profound implications for regulatory science, causal inference, clinical counseling, and public health ethics. The key to navigating this tension lies in precisely defining the scientific question of interest—the estimand—and selecting the analytical tools that can validly answer it.

### The Per-Protocol Estimand in Regulatory Science: Superiority versus Non-Inferiority Trials

In the landscape of clinical trials designed for regulatory approval, the choice between ITT and PP analysis is of paramount importance, and the appropriate emphasis depends critically on the trial's objective: to demonstrate superiority or non-inferiority.

In a **superiority trial**, the goal is to prove that a new intervention is more effective than a standard control. Here, the ITT analysis is universally regarded as the primary and most conservative approach. Non-adherence, crossovers, and use of non-protocol therapies tend to make the outcomes in the two randomized arms more similar, a phenomenon known as effect dilution. This dilution biases the ITT effect estimate towards the null hypothesis of no difference. Consequently, it becomes *more difficult* to demonstrate superiority, making the ITT analysis a robust and conservative test of a new treatment's benefit. A PP analysis may be presented as a supportive or [sensitivity analysis](@entry_id:147555) to estimate the treatment's effect under ideal adherence, but it is not the primary basis for a claim of superiority [@problem_id:4802373].

The situation is inverted in a **non-inferiority trial**. Here, the goal is to show that a new treatment is not unacceptably worse than an active control, as defined by a pre-specified non-inferiority margin, $\Delta$. In this context, the conservative bias of the ITT analysis becomes anti-conservative. The same dilution of effect that makes it harder to show a difference now makes it *easier* to claim that a new treatment is "not unacceptably worse." A genuinely inferior treatment may appear non-inferior simply because widespread non-adherence has biased the estimated effect towards zero [@problem_id:4618645, @problem_id:4917217]. This threatens the trial's **[assay sensitivity](@entry_id:176035)**—its ability to distinguish an effective therapy from an ineffective (or harmful) one.

Consider a hypothetical non-inferiority trial where the true risk difference between a new and standard drug among perfect adherers is $0.07$, exceeding the non-inferiority margin of $\Delta = 0.05$. A per-protocol analysis would correctly identify the new drug as inferior. However, if significant crossover occurs—for instance, 30% of patients in the new drug arm switch to the standard drug, and 25% in the standard arm switch to the new one—the ITT analysis would observe a diluted risk difference of approximately $0.03$. This estimate falls within the margin, leading to an erroneous conclusion of non-inferiority [@problem_id:4618645].

Because of this risk, regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) are highly cautious. For [non-inferiority trials](@entry_id:176667), they often expect the sponsor to demonstrate non-inferiority in *both* the ITT and the PP analysis populations. Concordance between the two analyses provides robust evidence. Conversely, if the analyses are discordant—for example, if ITT suggests non-inferiority but PP suggests inferiority—it raises a significant red flag that the ITT result may be an artifact of poor [assay sensitivity](@entry_id:176035), and the claim of non-inferiority is generally not accepted [@problem_id:4618693, @problem_id:4568055].

### The Per-Protocol Estimand as a Causal Question: Beyond Naive Analysis

While a naive PP analysis that simply excludes non-adherers is known to be biased, the scientific question it attempts to answer—"What is the effect of the treatment if taken as intended?"—remains highly relevant. The modern field of causal inference provides a framework for defining this question precisely and for developing analytical methods to answer it more rigorously.

#### The Problem of Selection Bias

The fundamental flaw of a naive PP analysis is **selection bias**. Adherence is a post-randomization behavior, and the factors that drive adherence are often related to a patient's prognosis. For example, patients who discontinue a therapy due to side effects may be systematically different (e.g., sicker, more frail) than those who tolerate it. Likewise, patients who proactively seek out a treatment outside of the protocol may be more motivated or have a different health status. Comparing these self-selected groups of "adherers" breaks the prognostic balance guaranteed by randomization [@problem_id:4618641]. This is not a theoretical concern; in a trial of long-acting injectable (LAI) versus oral antipsychotics for schizophrenia, for instance, the non-adherent group in the oral arm had a relapse rate more than double that of the non-adherent group in the LAI arm, indicating that the reasons for and consequences of non-adherence were profoundly different across the trial arms [@problem_id:4723820].

#### Formalizing the Estimand in the ICH E9 (R1) Framework

The International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E9 (R1) addendum on estimands provides a formal language to articulate the precise causal question of interest. In this framework, a per-protocol estimand is defined using a **hypothetical strategy** for handling intercurrent events (such as non-adherence or use of rescue medication). The key attributes of this estimand are:
*   **Population**: All randomized and eligible participants.
*   **Variable**: A counterfactual outcome, i.e., the outcome that *would have been observed* at the study's end if the protocol had been followed perfectly.
*   **Intervention**: Assignment to treatment versus control.
*   **Intercurrent Event Handling**: A hypothetical scenario is specified where events like treatment discontinuation, switching, or use of non-protocol therapy "would not occur."
*   **Summary Measure**: The difference in the average of this counterfactual outcome between the two treatment arms.

This formulation reframes the per-protocol question from "What was the effect in the subgroup of people who happened to adhere?" to "What would the effect have been in the entire randomized population if everyone had adhered?" [@problem_id:4618712].

#### Advanced Methods for Estimating the Per-Protocol Effect

Answering this counterfactual question requires advanced statistical methods that can adjust for the biases introduced by conditioning on post-randomization adherence. These methods often originate from the analysis of observational data, where confounding is the central challenge. The process can be conceptualized as emulating a new, hypothetical "target trial" from the data of the original trial.

A key step is to explicitly handle the protocol deviations. Individuals are followed until they deviate from their assigned protocol, at which point their follow-up is administratively censored. Because this censoring is informative (i.e., related to prognosis), a naive analysis of the uncensored data would be biased. To correct for this, methods such as **Inverse Probability of Censoring Weighting (IPCW)** can be employed. This approach involves creating a "pseudo-population" in which individuals who remained adherent are weighted up to represent those who deviated but had a similar measured history of covariates. If all factors that jointly predict adherence and the outcome (i.e., all confounders) are measured over time and included in the weighting model, this method can produce an unbiased estimate of the per-protocol effect [@problem_id:4618622].

In many realistic scenarios, the confounders are not just baseline characteristics but are **time-varying covariates** that are themselves affected by past treatment (e.g., blood pressure measurements in an antihypertensive trial). In such cases, more sophisticated methods like **Marginal Structural Models (MSM)** with combined inverse probability of treatment and censoring weights (IPTW/IPCW), **G-computation**, or **Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE)** are necessary to properly adjust for the complex feedback loop between treatment, covariates, and adherence [@problem_id:4618634].

It is also important to recognize that the per-protocol effect is not the only causal question one might ask in the presence of non-adherence. An alternative is the **Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE)**, which asks for the treatment effect specifically within the subgroup of "compliers"—individuals who would adhere to treatment if assigned to the treatment arm and adhere to control if assigned to the control arm. This effect can be estimated using the random assignment as an **instrumental variable**, under a specific set of assumptions [@problem_id:4400587].

### Interdisciplinary Applications and Interpretation

The principles of per-protocol analysis find application across a wide spectrum of medical and scientific disciplines, where the interpretation of the results requires careful consideration of the specific context.

#### Pharmacology and Medical Microbiology

In some cases, a PP analysis is essential for answering a specific biological question. Consider a trial comparing two [antiviral drugs](@entry_id:171468) for Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. The primary outcome might be viral clearance, but a key secondary outcome could be the emergence of antiviral resistance among patients who fail therapy. The ITT failure group will include patients who failed for various reasons: some may have failed due to true drug ineffectiveness or resistance, while others may have failed simply because they stopped taking the drug early due to side effects. The PP failure group, by contrast, is enriched for patients who took the drug as prescribed but still failed to clear the virus. Analyzing this PP group provides a clearer, less diluted estimate of the proportion of "on-treatment" failures that are associated with genotypic resistance. This allows for a more accurate comparison of the resistance profiles of the two drugs under sustained selective pressure [@problem_id:4625516].

#### Pragmatic Trials and Health Systems Research

In pragmatic trials, which aim to evaluate interventions under "real-world" conditions, the ITT effect is often the most relevant for health policy. For example, in a trial comparing a long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotic to a daily oral formulation, a primary advantage of the LAI is that it overcomes the problem of daily medication non-adherence. A PP analysis that only includes adherent patients would completely miss this key mechanism of action. Indeed, such a trial might show a large, clinically important benefit for the LAI strategy in the ITT analysis, but a negligible difference in a (biased) PP analysis comparing only adherers in both arms. In this case, the ITT result correctly captures the total causal effect of the LAI *strategy*, which is the quantity of interest for a health system deciding which formulation to make available [@problem_id:4723820]. Similarly, in complex surgical trials comparing techniques like Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) and Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement (SAVR), patient risk profiles often lead to "informative crossovers" (e.g., sicker patients assigned to surgery are switched to the less invasive TAVR). In such settings, "as-treated" and naive PP analyses are subject to severe confounding by indication, making the ITT estimate the most robust and interpretable measure of the effect of assigning one strategy versus the other [@problem_id:5084627].

#### Clinical Counseling and Public Health Ethics

The choice of analysis also has profound ethical dimensions, particularly in how results are communicated to different stakeholders. For **policymakers**, the ITT effect is generally the most ethically relevant measure to emphasize when considering the public deployment of an intervention. It provides the most realistic expectation of the population-level benefit and harm when a treatment policy is implemented in a setting with imperfect adherence [@problem_id:4618641].

For **individual patient counseling**, the situation is more nuanced. While the ITT effect gives a pragmatic picture of the average outcome, a properly estimated PP effect can be valuable. It helps answer a patient's question: "If I am able to commit to this therapy and take it as directed, what is the potential benefit I might see?" Presenting a (validly estimated) PP effect alongside the ITT effect and a transparent discussion of the risks of non-adherence (e.g., side effects that lead to discontinuation) can empower a shared decision-making process. However, it is unethical to present a biased PP estimate as the primary evidence of efficacy while omitting the ITT result, as this would hide the full picture of the treatment's benefits and harms in a typical patient population [@problem_id:4618654]. Transparent reporting, including the pre-specification of estimands, the explicit statement of all assumptions, and a thorough exploration of the results' sensitivity to those assumptions, is a scientific and ethical imperative [@problem_id:4618634].

In conclusion, per-protocol analysis represents a critical but challenging component of clinical trial interpretation. When applied naively, it is a source of profound bias. When framed within the modern estimand framework and executed with rigorous causal inference methods, it can answer important scientific questions about a treatment's effect under ideal conditions. The ultimate value of both ITT and PP analyses lies in a clear-eyed understanding of the distinct questions they answer and the transparent communication of their results and limitations to the scientific community, clinicians, patients, and policymakers.
