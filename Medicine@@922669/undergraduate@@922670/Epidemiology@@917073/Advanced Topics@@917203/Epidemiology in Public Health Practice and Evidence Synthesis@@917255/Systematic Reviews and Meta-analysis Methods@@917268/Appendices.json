Mastering this essential data extraction skill allows you to incorporate a wider range of published evidence into your synthesis. [@problem_id:4641431]", "problem": "A systematic review of antihypertensive interventions aims to perform a fixed-effect meta-analysis of mean differences in systolic blood pressure between intervention and control groups, using inverse-variance weighting. One included randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports a mean difference of $\\text{MD}=-4.8$ mmHg with a two-sided $0.95$ confidence interval (CI) from $-7.6$ mmHg (lower limit) to $-2.0$ mmHg (upper limit). The trial had $n_{1}=32$ participants in the intervention group and $n_{2}=30$ participants in the control group, and the CI was constructed using Student’s $t$-distribution under the equal-variance assumption with degrees of freedom $\\text{df} = n_{1} + n_{2} - 2$.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions of a two-sided $t$-based confidence interval for a mean difference, use only the reported CI limits and the degrees of freedom to obtain the standard error of the mean difference.

Express the final variance in $\\text{mmHg}^{2}$ and round your final answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the sampling variance of a mean difference from a reported confidence interval. The validation of the problem statement is the first step.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Mean difference: $\\text{MD} = -4.8$ mmHg\n- Confidence level: $0.95$ (two-sided)\n- Confidence interval (CI): Lower limit $L = -7.6$ mmHg, Upper limit $U = -2.0$ mmHg\n- Sample sizes: $n_{1} = 32$ (intervention), $n_{2} = 30$ (control)\n- Statistical distribution for CI: Student’s $t$-distribution\n- Degrees of freedom: $\\text{df} = n_{1} + n_{2} - 2$\n- Assumption: Equal variances between groups\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, describing a standard procedure in meta-analysis. It is well-posed and objective. We check for internal consistency.\nFirst, the degrees of freedom are calculated as $\\text{df} = 32 + 30 - 2 = 60$. This is consistent with the problem statement.\nSecond, the midpoint of the confidence interval is calculated as $\\frac{U + L}{2} = \\frac{(-2.0) + (-7.6)}{2} = \\frac{-9.6}{2} = -4.8$ mmHg. This value matches the reported mean difference $\\text{MD} = -4.8$ mmHg.\nThe problem is therefore self-contained, consistent, and scientifically valid. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Calculation\nThe fundamental formula for a two-sided confidence interval for a mean difference ($\\text{MD}$), based on the Student's $t$-distribution, is given by:\n$$ \\text{CI} = [\\text{MD} - t_{\\alpha/2, \\text{df}} \\times \\text{SE}, \\text{MD} + t_{\\alpha/2, \\text{df}} \\times \\text{SE}] $$\nwhere $\\text{SE}$ is the standard error of the mean difference, $\\text{df}$ are the degrees of freedom, and $t_{\\alpha/2, \\text{df}}$ is the critical value from the $t$-distribution for a confidence level of $1-\\alpha$.\n\nThe lower limit ($L$) and upper limit ($U$) of the CI are:\n$$ L = \\text{MD} - t_{\\alpha/2, \\text{df}} \\times \\text{SE} $$\n$$ U = \\text{MD} + t_{\\alpha/2, \\text{df}} \\times \\text{SE} $$\n\nTo find the standard error, we can use the width of the confidence interval, which is the difference between the upper and lower limits:\n$$ \\text{Width} = U - L = (\\text{MD} + t_{\\alpha/2, \\text{df}} \\times \\text{SE}) - (\\text{MD} - t_{\\alpha/2, \\text{df}} \\times \\text{SE}) = 2 \\times t_{\\alpha/2, \\text{df}} \\times \\text{SE} $$\nRearranging this equation allows us to solve for the standard error, $\\text{SE}$:\n$$ \\text{SE} = \\frac{U - L}{2 \\times t_{\\alpha/2, \\text{df}}} $$\nThis formula is robust as it depends only on the CI limits and the critical value, not the point estimate $\\text{MD}$.\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Upper limit $U = -2.0$ mmHg\n- Lower limit $L = -7.6$ mmHg\n- Confidence level is $0.95$, which implies a significance level of $\\alpha = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$. For a two-sided interval, we use $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$.\n- Degrees of freedom $\\text{df} = 60$.\n\nWe need the critical value $t_{\\alpha/2, \\text{df}} = t_{0.025, 60}$. From standard statistical tables for the Student's $t$-distribution, the critical value for $\\text{df}=60$ and a two-tailed probability of $0.05$ is exactly:\n$$ t_{0.025, 60} = 2.000 $$\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard error, $\\text{SE}$:\n$$ \\text{SE} = \\frac{(-2.0) - (-7.6)}{2 \\times 2.000} = \\frac{5.6}{4.0} = 1.4 \\text{ mmHg} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the sampling variance, which is required for inverse-variance weighting in a meta-analysis. The sampling variance, denoted by $V$, is the square of the standard error:\n$$ V = (\\text{SE})^{2} $$\nSubstituting the calculated value of $\\text{SE}$:\n$$ V = (1.4)^{2} = 1.96 \\text{ mmHg}^{2} $$\n\nThe final step is to round the result to four significant figures as requested. The number $1.96$ currently has three significant figures. To express it with four significant figures, we add a trailing zero.\n$$ V = 1.960 \\text{ mmHg}^{2} $$\nThis value represents the sampling variance of the mean difference for this specific study, which would be used in the denominator of its weight in a fixed-effect meta-analysis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.960}$$", "id": "4641431"}, {"introduction": "Before pooling study results, it is crucial to determine if they are consistent enough to be combined under a fixed-effect model, or if there is significant heterogeneity suggesting a random-effects model is more appropriate.
