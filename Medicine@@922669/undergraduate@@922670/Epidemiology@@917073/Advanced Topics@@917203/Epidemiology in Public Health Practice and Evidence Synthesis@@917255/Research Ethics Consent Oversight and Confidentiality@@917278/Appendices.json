Consider a proposed observational study that collects sensitive health data with strong confidentiality safeguards (for example, encryption and restricted access) but still retains a residual chance of harm from a confidentiality breach. A proportion of participants may receive a direct benefit (for example, a clinically actionable referral prompted by abnormal findings uncovered during data collection). Each participant also incurs a small burden cost (for example, time and inconvenience).\n\nUse the following fundamental base:\n- The expected value of a random quantity $X$ with outcomes $x_{i}$ and probabilities $p_{i}$ is $E[X]=\\sum_{i} p_{i} x_{i}$.\n- Ethical evaluation treats harms as negative contributions to net welfare and benefits as positive contributions, and fixed burdens add as a constant negative term per participant.\n\nLet $p_{h}$ be the probability of a harmful confidentiality breach with harm magnitude $H$ (in utility units), $p_{b}$ be the probability of a direct benefit with magnitude $B$ (in utility units), and $C$ be the fixed burden cost per participant (in utility units). Derive from first principles an expression for the net expected utility per participant, $U$, that combines the expected benefit, expected harm, and fixed burden cost. Then compute $U$ for $p_{h}=0.01$, $H=100$, $p_{b}=0.2$, $B=10$, and $C=0.5$.\n\nState whether $U>0$ and briefly interpret the result in terms of IRB risk–benefit oversight. Express the final numerical value of $U$ in utility units. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the net expected utility per participant, $U$, in a proposed observational study. This derivation will be based on the provided principles of expected value and ethical evaluation. Subsequently, the numerical value of $U$ will be calculated using the given parameters, and the result will be interpreted.\n\nFirst, we establish the components of the net expected utility based on the problem description. The ethical evaluation considers three factors for each participant: a potential benefit, a potential harm, and a fixed burden. The net expected utility $U$ will be the sum of the expected values of each of these components.\n\n1.  **Expected Benefit**: A participant has a probability $p_b$ of receiving a direct benefit of magnitude $B$. The alternative is receiving no benefit, which has a utility of $0$, with a probability of $1 - p_b$. The expected utility from the benefit, which we can denote as $U_B$, is calculated using the expected value formula $E[X] = \\sum_{i} p_{i} x_{i}$:\n    $$U_B = (p_b \\times B) + ((1 - p_b) \\times 0) = p_b B$$\n\n2.  **Expected Harm**: A participant has a probability $p_h$ of suffering harm of magnitude $H$ from a confidentiality breach. The problem states that harms are treated as negative contributions to welfare. Therefore, the utility of this outcome is $-H$. The alternative is no harm, which has a utility of $0$, with a probability of $1 - p_h$. The expected utility from the harm, denoted as $U_H$, is:\n    $$U_H = (p_h \\times (-H)) + ((1 - p_h) \\times 0) = -p_h H$$\n\n3.  **Burden Cost**: Each participant incurs a fixed burden cost $C$. This is a definite cost, not a probabilistic one, meaning it occurs with a probability of $1$. It is described as a constant negative term. The utility contribution from the burden, denoted $U_C$, is therefore:\n    $$U_C = 1 \\times (-C) = -C$$\n\nThe net expected utility per participant, $U$, is the sum of these three components:\n$$U = U_B + U_H + U_C$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above, we obtain the general formula for the net expected utility:\n$$U = p_b B - p_h H - C$$\nThis expression represents the derived formula from first principles, combining the expected benefit, the expected harm, and the fixed burden cost for a single participant.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $U$ using the provided data:\n-   Probability of harm, $p_h = 0.01$\n-   Magnitude of harm, $H = 100$ utility units\n-   Probability of benefit, $p_b = 0.2$\n-   Magnitude of benefit, $B = 10$ utility units\n-   Fixed burden cost, $C = 0.5$ utility units\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $U$:\n$$U = (0.2 \\times 10) - (0.01 \\times 100) - 0.5$$\nPerforming the calculations for each term:\n-   Expected benefit component: $0.2 \\times 10 = 2$\n-   Expected harm component: $0.01 \\times 100 = 1$\n-   Burden cost component: $0.5$\n\nSo, the net expected utility is:\n$$U = 2 - 1 - 0.5$$\n$$U = 0.5$$\n\nThe final numerical value is $U = 0.5$ utility units.\n\nFinally, we interpret this result. Since $U = 0.5$, it is true that $U > 0$. A positive net expected utility suggests that, according to this quantitative model, the anticipated benefits for a participant outweigh the combination of anticipated risks and certain burdens. In the context of Institutional Review Board (IRB) oversight, a result of $U > 0$ provides preliminary support for the study's ethical favorability under the principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence. It indicates an acceptable risk-benefit profile, at least at this simplified screening level. While not the sole determinant of approval (as principles like justice and the particulars of informed consent must also be thoroughly evaluated), a positive net expected utility is a crucial condition for a study to be considered ethically justifiable.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5}$$", "id": "4630314"}, {"introduction": "Informed consent is the cornerstone of ethical research involving human participants, but how can we be sure that consent is truly \"informed\"?

Do not use a percentage sign.", "solution": "The problem requires us to derive and compute the posterior expected value of a participant's comprehension probability, denoted by $\\theta$. This is a classic application of Bayesian inference. We are given the prior distribution for $\\theta$, the data from a comprehension check, and the model for the data generation process.\n\nFirst, we define the components of our Bayesian model: the prior distribution, the likelihood function, and the posterior distribution.\n\nThe prior distribution for the probability $\\theta$ is given as a Beta distribution with parameters $a=8$ and $b=2$:\n$$ \\theta \\sim \\mathrm{Beta}(a, b) $$\nThe probability density function (PDF) for the prior is:\n$$ p(\\theta) = p(\\theta | a, b) = \\frac{\\Gamma(a+b)}{\\Gamma(a)\\Gamma(b)} \\theta^{a-1} (1-\\theta)^{b-1} $$\nfor $\\theta \\in [0, 1]$, where $\\Gamma(\\cdot)$ is the gamma function.\n\nThe data consists of the number of correct answers, $k$, in a comprehension check with $n$ independent items. Given a specific value of $\\theta$, the number of correct answers $k$ follows a Binomial distribution. This is our likelihood function:\n$$ p(k|\\theta, n) = \\binom{n}{k} \\theta^k (1-\\theta)^{n-k} $$\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, the posterior distribution of $\\theta$ given the observed data ($k$ and $n$) is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the prior distribution:\n$$ p(\\theta | k, n) \\propto p(k|\\theta, n) \\cdot p(\\theta) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the likelihood and the prior:\n$$ p(\\theta | k, n) \\propto \\left[ \\binom{n}{k} \\theta^k (1-\\theta)^{n-k} \\right] \\cdot \\left[ \\frac{\\Gamma(a+b)}{\\Gamma(a)\\Gamma(b)} \\theta^{a-1} (1-\\theta)^{b-1} \\right] $$\nTo find the functional form of the posterior distribution, we can ignore all terms that do not depend on $\\theta$, as they are part of the normalization constant. This gives:\n$$ p(\\theta | k, n) \\propto \\theta^k (1-\\theta)^{n-k} \\cdot \\theta^{a-1} (1-\\theta)^{b-1} $$\nCombining the powers of $\\theta$ and $(1-\\theta)$:\n$$ p(\\theta | k, n) \\propto \\theta^{a+k-1} (1-\\theta)^{b+n-k-1} $$\nThis expression is the kernel of a Beta distribution. This confirms the conjugacy of the Beta prior and the Binomial likelihood. The posterior distribution for $\\theta$ is therefore also a Beta distribution, with updated parameters $a'$ and $b'$:\n$$ a' = a+k $$\n$$ b' = b+n-k $$\nSo, the posterior distribution is:\n$$ \\theta | k, n \\sim \\mathrm{Beta}(a+k, b+n-k) $$\n\nThe next step is to derive the posterior expected comprehension probability, $E[\\theta | k, n]$. The expected value of a random variable $X$ that follows a Beta distribution, $X \\sim \\mathrm{Beta}(\\alpha, \\beta)$, is given by the formula:\n$$ E[X] = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta} $$\nApplying this formula to our posterior distribution, $\\mathrm{Beta}(a', b')$, we find the posterior expectation of $\\theta$:\n$$ E[\\theta | k, n] = \\frac{a'}{a'+b'} = \\frac{a+k}{(a+k) + (b+n-k)} $$\nSimplifying the denominator, we get the general expression for the posterior mean:\n$$ E[\\theta | k, n] = \\frac{a+k}{a+b+n} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of this expectation using the values provided in the problem statement: $a=8$, $b=2$, $n=5$, and $k=4$.\n$$ E[\\theta | k=4, n=5] = \\frac{8+4}{8+2+5} $$\n$$ E[\\theta | k=4, n=5] = \\frac{12}{10+5} $$\n$$ E[\\theta | k=4, n=5] = \\frac{12}{15} $$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$$ \\frac{12}{15} = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be reported as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. To express $0.8$ with four significant figures, we write:\n$$ 0.8000 $$\nThis value meets the threshold condition for not requiring re-consent, as $E[\\theta | k] < 0.8$ is not satisfied.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8000}$$", "id": "4630320"}, {"introduction": "Protecting participant confidentiality in the age of big data requires more than simply removing names and addresses.

We proceed by applying the provided definitions to the given data.\n\nFirst, we establish the parameters of the problem. The equivalence class contains a total of $N=10$ records. Within this class, the sensitive attribute, which has two distinct categories, has counts of $\\{7, 3\\}$. The sum of these counts is $7+3=10$, which is consistent with the size of the equivalence class. The distribution of the same sensitive attribute in the overall population is given as a probability distribution $Q = \\{q_1, q_2\\} = \\{0.6, 0.4\\}$.\n\nThe first metric to compute is the distinct-value $l$-diversity. The problem defines this as \"the number of distinct sensitive attribute values present in the equivalence class (counting values with nonzero frequency)\". The counts of the sensitive values in the class are $7$ and $3$. Since both counts are greater than zero, there are two distinct values for the sensitive attribute represented in the equivalence class. Therefore, the distinct-value $l$-diversity, denoted by $l$, is:\n$$ l = 2 $$\n\nThe second metric is $t$-closeness, which is given by the total variation distance between the empirical distribution of the sensitive attribute within the equivalence class, $P$, and the overall population distribution, $Q$. The formula for the total variation distance is:\n$$ t = d_{TV}(P, Q) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i} |p_{i} - q_{i}| $$\nFirst, we must determine the empirical distribution $P = \\{p_1, p_2\\}$ for the equivalence class.

The probabilities are calculated as the relative frequencies:\n$$ p_1 = \\frac{7}{10} = 0.7 $$\n$$ p_2 = \\frac{3}{10} = 0.3 $$\nThus, the distribution within the equivalence class is $P = \\{0.7, 0.3\\}$.
