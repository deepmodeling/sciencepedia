The concepts of a closed cohort, incidence proportion (risk), and complete follow-up are standard epidemiological definitions.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data to calculate the incidence proportion: the number of new cases and the size of the initial population at risk. The question is unambiguous. The conditions, while idealized (e.g., no loss to follow-up), serve to make the problem solvable using the fundamental definition of incidence proportion without requiring more advanced methods like survival analysis.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated using clear, objective, and quantitative language. It is free of any subjectivity or opinion.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. It is a standard, albeit idealized, problem designed to test the understanding of a core epidemiological concept.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe quantity to be determined is the $2$-year incidence proportion, $IP(2)$. In epidemiology, for a closed cohort followed over a specified time period, the incidence proportion (also known as cumulative incidence or risk) is defined as the proportion of individuals in the population, initially free of the outcome, who develop the outcome during that period.\n\nThe formula for incidence proportion is:\n$$\nIP(\\Delta t) = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases during the time period } \\Delta t}{\\text{Number of individuals at risk at the start of the time period}}\n$$\n\nLet $I$ be the number of new cases (first events) observed during the follow-up period and let $N$ be the size of the cohort at baseline. The problem states that the entire cohort was free of the event at the start of the study, so all $N$ individuals were at risk.\n\nFrom the extracted givens, we have:\n- The number of new cases over the $2$-year period, $I = 400$.\n- The number of individuals at risk at baseline, $N = 10{,}000$.\n- The time period is $\\Delta t = 2$ years.\n\nWe can now calculate the $2$-year incidence proportion, $IP(2)$:\n$$\nIP(2) = \\frac{I}{N} = \\frac{400}{10{,}000}\n$$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$\nIP(2) = 0.04\n$$\n\nThe problem also requires an interpretation of this quantity as a probability. For a closed cohort with no competing risks and complete follow-up, as specified in this problem, the incidence proportion is a direct measure of the average risk for an individual to develop the event over the specified time period. Therefore, $IP(2) = 0.04$ can be interpreted as the probability that a randomly selected individual from this cohort at baseline will experience their first adverse health event within the $2$-year follow-up period. This probabilistic interpretation is valid because the denominator ($N$) represents the complete set of all possible outcomes for the population at risk at the beginning, and the numerator ($I$) represents the count of the specific event of interest occurring within that population over the defined time. The ratio thus conforms to the classical definition of probability for a finite sample space.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.04}$$", "id": "4599565"}, {"introduction": "The accuracy of any risk calculation depends critically on correctly defining the denominator: the population at risk. This exercise uses a simple, minimal counterexample to demonstrate the significant bias that arises when this rule is violated. You will see how including even one immune individual in the at-risk population can dilute the estimated risk, a crucial lesson in study design and analysis [@problem_id:4599591].", "problem": "A closed cohort study of a short outbreak is conducted over a fixed interval with the goal of estimating the incidence proportion (risk) among individuals eligible to develop the disease in that interval.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement has been rigorously validated and is deemed to be a valid, self-contained, and scientifically grounded problem in epidemiology. It is well-posed, objective, and free from internal contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe central concept is the incidence proportion, or risk, which is defined as the number of new cases of a disease that occur during a specified time interval, divided by the number of individuals in the population who are at risk of developing the disease at the beginning of that interval. Let $IP$ denote the incidence proportion, $C$ denote the number of new cases, and $N_{elig}$ denote the number of eligible (at-risk) individuals. The definition is formally expressed as:\n$$IP = \\frac{C}{N_{elig}}$$\n\nWe must first calculate the true incidence proportion, denoted as $IP_{true}$. According to the problem statement, the cohort consists of $2$ individuals at baseline. Of these, $1$ is susceptible to the disease and $1$ is completely immune. By definition, only susceptible individuals are eligible to become new cases and are thus included in the at-risk population.\nThe true number of eligible individuals is therefore $N_{elig, true} = 1$.\nThe problem states that exactly $1$ new case is observed during the interval. Therefore, $C = 1$.\n\nUsing these values, the true incidence proportion is:\n$$IP_{true} = \\frac{C}{N_{elig, true}} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$$\nAn incidence proportion of $1$ indicates that all individuals who were at risk at the start of the interval developed the disease during the interval.\n\nNext, we calculate the misclassified incidence proportion, denoted as $IP_{misc}$. The problem states that due to a misclassification error, the investigators \"mistakenly include all baseline cohort members as eligible\". The total number of individuals in the cohort at baseline is $2$.\nTherefore, the misclassified number of eligible individuals is $N_{elig, misc} = 2$.\nThe number of observed cases remains unchanged, so $C = 1$.\n\nThe misclassified incidence proportion is:\n$$IP_{misc} = \\frac{C}{N_{elig, misc}} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the signed relative bias, which we will denote as $B_{rel}$. The definition is provided as the ratio of the misclassified incidence proportion to the true incidence proportion, minus one.\n$$B_{rel} = \\frac{IP_{misc}}{IP_{true}} - 1$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated values for $IP_{true}$ and $IP_{misc}$ into this formula yields:\n$$B_{rel} = \\frac{1/2}{1} - 1$$\n$$B_{rel} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1$$\n$$B_{rel} = -\\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nAs a decimal, this is equal to $-0.5$. This negative value indicates that the misclassification has led to an underestimation of the true risk. Specifically, including an immune individual in the denominator artificially inflates the size of the at-risk population, thereby decreasing the calculated proportion of new cases. The magnitude of the relative bias is $50\\%$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.5}$$", "id": "4599591"}, {"introduction": "While incidence proportion (risk) and incidence rate are related, they are distinct measures that are often confused. This practice explores the formal mathematical link between them under the common assumption of a constant hazard, a scenario with broad applications.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of epidemiology and time-to-event analysis, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objectively stated. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the $3$-year cumulative incidence, also known as incidence proportion or risk, from first principles, given a constant hazard rate.\n\nLet $T$ be a non-negative random variable representing the time to an event. We begin by defining the fundamental quantities of time-to-event analysis.\n\n1.  The **survivor function**, $S(t)$, is the probability that an individual has not experienced the event by time $t$.\n    $$S(t) = P(T  t)$$\n2.  The **hazard function**, $\\lambda(t)$, is the instantaneous rate of event occurrence at time $t$, conditional on survival up to that time. It is defined as:\n    $$\\lambda(t) = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{P(t  T \\le t + \\Delta t | T  t)}{\\Delta t}$$\n    The probability in the numerator can be expressed using conditional probability rules as $\\frac{P(t  T \\le t + \\Delta t \\text{ and } T  t)}{P(T  t)} = \\frac{P(t  T \\le t + \\Delta t)}{S(t)}$.\n    The probability $P(t  T \\le t + \\Delta t)$ is equal to $S(t) - S(t + \\Delta t)$. Therefore,\n    $$\\lambda(t) = \\frac{1}{S(t)} \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{S(t) - S(t + \\Delta t)}{\\Delta t} = -\\frac{1}{S(t)} \\frac{dS(t)}{dt}$$\n3.  The **cumulative incidence** or **risk**, $F(t)$, is the probability that an individual has experienced the event by time $t$. It is the complement of the survivor function.\n    $$F(t) = P(T \\le t) = 1 - S(t)$$\n\nFrom the definition of the hazard function, we have the differential equation $\\frac{dS(t)}{S(t)} = -\\lambda(t) dt$. Integrating both sides from $0$ to a time $t$ gives:\n$$\\int_0^t \\frac{dS(u)}{S(u)} = -\\int_0^t \\lambda(u) du$$\n$$[\\ln(S(u))]_0^t = -\\int_0^t \\lambda(u) du$$\nSince $S(0) = P(T  0) = 1$ (assuming the entire cohort is at risk at the start), $\\ln(S(0)) = 0$.\n$$\\ln(S(t)) = -\\int_0^t \\lambda(u) du$$\nThe integral on the right-hand side is the **cumulative hazard function**, $\\Lambda(t) = \\int_0^t \\lambda(u) du$.\nExponentiating both sides yields the fundamental relationship between the survivor function and the cumulative hazard:\n$$S(t) = \\exp(-\\Lambda(t)) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^t \\lambda(u) du\\right)$$\n\nThe problem states that the hazard is constant over time, so $\\lambda(t) = \\lambda$ for a constant $\\lambda$. The given incidence rate is $5$ per $100$ person-years, which is stated to be equal to this constant hazard. We convert this to a rate per year:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{5}{100 \\text{ person-years}} = 0.05 \\text{ year}^{-1}$$\nUnder this constant hazard assumption, the cumulative hazard function becomes:\n$$\\Lambda(t) = \\int_0^t \\lambda du = \\lambda \\int_0^t du = \\lambda t$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the survivor function:\n$$S(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\nThe cumulative incidence $F(t)$ is therefore:\n$$F(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\nThis is the exact expression for the cumulative incidence under a constant hazard model (which corresponds to an exponential distribution of event times).\n\nWe are asked to compute the $3$-year cumulative incidence, which means we must evaluate $F(t)$ at $t=3$ years, using $\\lambda = 0.05 \\text{ year}^{-1}$.\n$$F(3) = 1 - \\exp(-0.05 \\times 3) = 1 - \\exp(-0.15)$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$$F(3) \\approx 1 - 0.860707976... = 0.139292024...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the $3$-year cumulative incidence is $0.1393$.\n\nFor comparison, the problem mentions the naive linear (rare disease) approximation, which is given by the product of the incidence rate and the time at risk:\n$$F_{approx}(t) = \\lambda \\times t$$\nFor $t=3$ years:\n$$F_{approx}(3) = 0.05 \\text{ year}^{-1} \\times 3 \\text{ years} = 0.15$$\nThe difference between the approximation and the exact value is $0.15 - 0.1393 = 0.0107$. The sign is positive, meaning the naive approximation overestimates the true risk.\n\nThe explanation for this difference lies in two related perspectives:\n\n1.  **Depletion of Susceptibles**: The linear approximation $F_{approx}(t) = \\lambda t$ implicitly assumes that the number of individuals at risk remains constant throughout the follow-up period. It calculates the expected number of events as if the initial population size is maintained. However, in reality, as individuals experience the event, they are removed from the at-risk population. The true number of events occurring in any interval is proportional to the size of the susceptible pool at the start of that interval, which is continuously decreasing. The exact formula $F(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t)$ correctly accounts for this \"depletion of susceptibles.\" Because the linear approximation fails to account for this decline in the at-risk population, it consistently overestimates the true cumulative risk.\n\n2.  **Series Expansion**: The mathematical basis for the approximation and its error can be seen through the Taylor series expansion of the exponential function. The exact risk is $F(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t)$. The Maclaurin series for $\\exp(x)$ is $\\exp(x) = 1 + x + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\dots$.\n    Letting $x = -\\lambda t$, we get:\n    $$\\exp(-\\lambda t) = 1 - \\lambda t + \\frac{(\\lambda t)^2}{2!} - \\frac{(\\lambda t)^3}{3!} + \\dots$$\n    Substituting this into the expression for $F(t)$:\n    $$F(t) = 1 - \\left(1 - \\lambda t + \\frac{(\\lambda t)^2}{2} - \\frac{(\\lambda t)^3}{6} + \\dots\\right)$$\n    $$F(t) = \\lambda t - \\frac{(\\lambda t)^2}{2} + \\frac{(\\lambda t)^3}{6} - \\dots$$\n    The naive approximation $F_{approx}(t) = \\lambda t$ is simply the first term of this series. This approximation is valid only when $\\lambda t$ is very small (the \"rare disease\" assumption), such that the higher-order terms are negligible.\n    The error in the approximation is:\n    $$F_{approx}(t) - F(t) = (\\lambda t) - \\left(\\lambda t - \\frac{(\\lambda t)^2}{2} + \\dots\\right) = \\frac{(\\lambda t)^2}{2} - \\frac{(\\lambda t)^3}{6} + \\dots$$\n    The leading error term is $\\frac{(\\lambda t)^2}{2}$. Since $\\lambda  0$ and $t  0$, this term is always positive, which mathematically confirms that the linear approximation $\\lambda t$ is an overestimate of the true risk $1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t)$. The magnitude of the error is principally determined by this leading term. For our case, with $\\lambda t = 0.15$, the leading error term is $\\frac{(0.15)^2}{2} = \\frac{0.0225}{2} = 0.01125$, which is a close approximation of the actual difference of $0.0107$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1393}$$", "id": "4599560"}]}
