It uses standard, non-controversial definitions from epidemiology. All necessary data are provided, and there are no internal contradictions. The data are hypothetical but plausible. The problem is a straightforward application of core epidemiological principles designed to highlight the distinction between proportionate mortality and absolute risk, which is a key concept. It does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core epidemiologic definition of Proportionate Mortality ($PM$) for a specific cause is the number of deaths from that cause in a given period divided by the total number of deaths from all causes in the same period. The formula is:\n$$\nPM_{\\text{cause}} = \\frac{\\text{Number of deaths from a specific cause}}{\\text{Total number of deaths from all causes}}\n$$\n\nFirst, we must calculate the total number of deaths ($D_{\\text{total}}$) for each municipality.\n\nFor Municipality $\\mathcal{A}$:\nThe total number of deaths, $D_{\\text{total},\\mathcal{A}}$, is the sum of deaths from all listed causes:\n$$\nD_{\\text{total},\\mathcal{A}} = D_{\\text{cvd},\\mathcal{A}} + D_{\\text{can},\\mathcal{A}} + D_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{A}} + D_{\\text{inj},\\mathcal{A}}\n$$\n$$\nD_{\\text{total},\\mathcal{A}} = 120 + 80 + 50 + 50 = 300\n$$\n\nFor Municipality $\\mathcal{B}$:\nThe total number of deaths, $D_{\\text{total},\\mathcal{B}}$, is the sum of deaths from all listed causes:\n$$\nD_{\\text{total},\\mathcal{B}} = D_{\\text{cvd},\\mathcal{B}} + D_{\\text{can},\\mathcal{B}} + D_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{B}} + D_{\\text{inj},\\mathcal{B}}\n$$\n$$\nD_{\\text{total},\\mathcal{B}} = 600 + 300 + 200 + 100 = 1200\n$$\n\nNow we can compute the required Proportionate Mortality values for each task.\n\n**Task 1: Proportionate Mortality for infectious disease**\n\nFor Municipality $\\mathcal{A}$, the Proportionate Mortality for infectious disease ($PM_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{A}}$) is:\n$$\nPM_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{A}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{A}}}{D_{\\text{total},\\mathcal{A}}} = \\frac{50}{300} = \\frac{1}{6}\n$$\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $0.16666...$. Rounded to four significant figures, $PM_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{A}} = 0.1667$.\n\nFor Municipality $\\mathcal{B}$, the Proportionate Mortality for infectious disease ($PM_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{B}}$) is:\n$$\nPM_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{B}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{B}}}{D_{\\text{total},\\mathcal{B}}} = \\frac{200}{1200} = \\frac{1}{6}\n$$\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $0.16666...$.

The absolute risk of death from a cause (or the cause-specific mortality rate) is defined as the number of deaths from that cause divided by the total population size.\n$$\n\\text{Absolute Risk}_{\\text{cause}} = \\frac{\\text{Number of deaths from a specific cause}}{\\text{Total population}}\n$$\nLet's compute the absolute risk for infectious death in each municipality.\nFor $\\mathcal{A}$:\n$$\n\\text{Risk}_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{A}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{A}}}{N_{\\mathcal{A}}} = \\frac{50}{50{,}000} = \\frac{1}{1000} = 0.001\n$$\nFor $\\mathcal{B}$:\n$$\n\\text{Risk}_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{B}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{B}}}{N_{\\mathcal{B}}} = \\frac{200}{600{,}000} = \\frac{2}{6000} = \\frac{1}{3000} \\approx 0.000333\n$$\nWe observe that $PM_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{A}} = PM_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{B}} = 1/6$, but $\\text{Risk}_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{A}} \\neq \\text{Risk}_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{B}}$. The risk of dying from an infectious disease is three times higher in Municipality $\\mathcal{A}$ than in Municipality $\\mathcal{B}$. Therefore, identical Proportionate Mortality does not imply identical absolute risk. This is because $PM$ is a ratio of deaths-to-deaths and is independent of the population size, whereas absolute risk is a ratio of deaths-to-population and directly measures the risk to an individual in that population.\n\nFinal computed values for reporting, rounded to four significant figures:\n- $PM_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{A}} = 0.1667$\n- $PM_{\\text{inf},\\mathcal{B}} = 0.1667$\n- $PM_{\\text{cvd},\\mathcal{A}} = 0.4000$\n- $PM_{\\text{cvd},\\mathcal{B}} = 0.5000$\n\nThese values will be placed in the final answer box in the specified order.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.1667 & 0.1667 & 0.4000 & 0.5000\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4575354"}, {"introduction": "In the midst of an unfolding outbreak, health officials often need to report on disease severity in real-time, even when many patients are still actively ill.

Concepts like a closed cohort, case-fatality, cumulative incidence, and the challenge of interpreting data from an ongoing outbreak (where not all outcomes are yet known) are fundamental and scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides explicit definitions for the quantities to be calculated and compared. The data are sufficient to perform the calculation. The question about bias is a standard exercise in epidemiological methods, comparing a biased estimator to a more standard measure of risk.\n- **Objective (Critical)**: The problem uses precise, objective terminology standard to the field. It is free from subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-defined question in epidemiological methods. I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Derivation\nThe problem requires two main steps: first, to calculate the \"naive case-fatality proportion\" as defined, and second, to analyze its bias relative to the $30$-day cumulative incidence of death for the entire cohort.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Naive Case-Fatality Proportion**\n\nThe problem states that the naive case-fatality proportion at day $30$ is \"computed only among cases with known outcomes by day $30$ (i.e., deaths or recoveries)\".\nThe number of deaths is $d$.\nThe total number of cases with a known outcome is the sum of deaths and recoveries, which is $d+r$.\nTherefore, the naive case-fatality proportion, which we can denote as $\\text{nCFP}$, is given by the formula:\n$$ \\text{nCFP} = \\frac{d}{d+r} $$\nUsing the provided data, $d=80$ and $r=650$:\n$$ \\text{nCFP} = \\frac{80}{80 + 650} = \\frac{80}{730} $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ \\frac{80}{730} \\approx 0.109589... $$\nRounding to four decimal places gives approximately $0.1096$.\n\n**Part 2: Bias Characterization**\n\nThe problem asks to characterize the bias of this $\\text{nCFP}$ relative to the \"$30$-day cumulative incidence among all cases\". The cumulative incidence of death at day $30$, denoted $\\text{CI}_{30}$, is the risk of death by day $30$ among all enrolled cases. This is calculated as the number of deaths divided by the total number of individuals in the cohort at the start of the follow-up period.\n$$ \\text{CI}_{30} = \\frac{d}{N} $$\nUsing the provided data, $d=80$ and $N=1000$:\n$$ \\text{CI}_{30} = \\frac{80}{1000} = 0.08 $$\nThe bias is the difference between the estimator ($\\text{nCFP}$) and the reference value ($\\text{CI}_{30}$):\n$$ \\text{Bias} = \\text{nCFP} - \\text{CI}_{30} = \\frac{d}{d+r} - \\frac{d}{N} $$\nIn this cohort, the number of active cases is $N - d - r = 1000 - 80 - 650 = 270$. Since there are actively ill individuals, the number of cases with resolved outcomes ($d+r$) is less than the total number of cases ($N$).\n$$ d+r = 730 < 1000 = N $$\nSince $d > 0$ and $d+r < N$, it is a mathematical certainty that $\\frac{1}{d+r} > \\frac{1}{N}$, and therefore:\n$$ \\frac{d}{d+r} > \\frac{d}{N} $$\nThis means that the $\\text{nCFP}$ is **upwardly biased** relative to the $30$-day cumulative incidence of death, $\\text{CI}_{30}$. Specifically, $0.1096 > 0.08$. This upward bias will always exist as long as there are cases with unresolved outcomes ($N > d+r$).\n\nNext, we must consider how the magnitude of this upward bias is affected by the typical timing of death versus recovery.\nThe magnitude of the bias is given by:\n$$ \\text{Bias magnitude} = \\frac{d}{d+r} - \\frac{d}{N} = d \\left( \\frac{1}{d+r} - \\frac{1}{N} \\right) $$\nLet's consider two scenarios for how the disease progresses, which will affect the observed values of $d$ and $r$ at the interim time point of day $30$:\n\n1.  **Deaths occur earlier than recoveries**: If the time from onset to death is typically shorter than the time from onset to recovery, then at any interim point like day $30$, the group of individuals with resolved outcomes ($d+r$) will be disproportionately composed of deaths. This means the ratio of $d$ to $r$ will be relatively high. A higher value of $d$ for a given sum $d+r$ (or a lower value of $r$ for a given $d$) makes the fraction $\\frac{d}{d+r}$ larger. A larger $\\text{nCFP}$ results in a larger upward bias relative to $\\text{CI}_{30}$.\n\n2.  **Recoveries occur earlier than deaths**: If the time to recovery is typically shorter than the time to death, the group with resolved outcomes ($d+r$) will be disproportionately composed of recoveries. The ratio of $d$ to $r$ will be relatively low. This makes the fraction $\\frac{d}{d+r}$ smaller and brings it closer to the value of $\\frac{d}{N}$. Consequently, the magnitude of the upward bias is smaller.\n\nIn summary, the $\\text{nCFP}$ is always upwardly biased relative to $\\text{CI}_{30}$ when active cases exist. The magnitude of this upward bias is larger when deaths occur earlier in the course of illness than recoveries, and smaller when recoveries occur earlier than deaths.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The naive case-fatality proportion at day $30$ is $d/N = 80/1000 = 0.08$; it is upwardly biased when recoveries occur earlier than deaths and downwardly biased when deaths occur earlier than recoveries.**\n- The formula for the naive proportion is given as $d/N$. This is incorrect. The problem defines it based on resolved outcomes, which corresponds to $d/(d+r)$.\n- The characterization of the bias is incorrect. The bias of $\\text{nCFP}$ relative to $d/N$ is always upward, its direction does not change with timing. This option mischaracterizes the direction of the bias.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The naive case-fatality proportion at day $30$ is $d/(d+r) = 80/(80+650) \\approx 0.1096$; it is always upwardly biased relative to $d/N$, with the magnitude of the upward bias larger when deaths tend to occur earlier than recoveries and smaller when recoveries tend to occur earlier than deaths.**\n- The formula, $d/(d+r)$, and the calculation, $80/(80+650) \\approx 0.1096$, are correct as per the problem's definition.\n- The bias characterization is entirely correct. It correctly states that the $\\text{nCFP}$ is \"always upwardly biased relative to $d/N$\". It also correctly describes how the magnitude of this bias is affected by the relative timing of death and recovery.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The naive case-fatality proportion at day $30$ is $d/(d+r) = 80/(80+650) \\approx 0.1096$; it is downwardly biased relative to $d/N$ when recoveries occur earlier than deaths and upwardly biased when deaths occur earlier than recoveries.**\n- The calculation is correct.\n- The bias characterization is incorrect. It claims the direction of the bias can change, stating it can be \"downwardly biased\". As shown in the derivation, the bias of $\\frac{d}{d+r}$ relative to $\\frac{d}{N}$ is always upward as long as $N > d+r$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The naive case-fatality proportion at day $30$ is $r/N = 650/1000 = 0.65$; its bias direction cannot be determined from timing differences.**\n- The formula $r/N$ is the cumulative incidence of recovery, not the naive case-fatality proportion. The calculation is for the wrong quantity.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The naive case-fatality proportion at day $30$ is $d/D_{\\text{pop}}$, where $D_{\\text{pop}}$ is the total number of deaths from all causes in the source population by day $30$; it is unbiased relative to $d/N$ regardless of timing.**\n- The formula $d/D_{\\text{pop}}$ is irrelevant to the problem. It introduces a term, $D_{\\text{pop}}$, not defined in the problem's scope, which is a specific cohort of cases, not the general population. This is not the naive case-fatality proportion.\n- The claim of being \"unbiased\" is also incorrect.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4575428"}, {"introduction": "Aggregate data can sometimes tell a misleading story, a phenomenon famously known as Simpson's paradox.

The crude rates, $\\frac{135+1}{900+100} = 0.136$ for $X$ and $\\frac{20+18}{100+900} = 0.038$ for $Y$, show a reversed conclusion, confirming Simpson's paradox.\n\nNext, we establish the standard population as specified: the combined case distribution across both hospitals.\n-   Number of severe cases in the standard population, $N_{\\text{std,sev}}$:\n    $$\n    N_{\\text{std,sev}} = N_{X,\\text{sev}} + N_{Y,\\text{sev}} = 900 + 100 = 1000\n    $$\n-   Number of mild cases in the standard population, $N_{\\text{std,mild}}$:\n    $$\n    N_{\\text{std,mild}} = N_{X,\\text{mild}} + N_{Y,\\text{mild}} = 100 + 900 = 1000\n    $$\n-   Total number of cases in the standard population, $N_{\\text{std,total}}$:\n    $$\n    N_{\\text{std,total}} = N_{\\text{std,sev}} + N_{\\text{std,mild}} = 1000 + 1000 = 2000\n    $$\n\nNow, we compute the direct standardized CFR for each hospital. This is a weighted average of its stratum-specific CFRs, where the weights are the proportions of each stratum in the standard population. Alternatively, we can calculate the expected number of deaths in the standard population if it were subject to each hospital's stratum-specific CFRs.\n\nThe weight for the severe stratum is $w_{\\text{sev}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{std,sev}}}{N_{\\text{std,total}}} = \\frac{1000}{2000} = 0.5$.\nThe weight for the mild stratum is $w_{\\text{mild}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{std,mild}}}{N_{\\text{std,total}}} = \\frac{1000}{2000} = 0.5$.\n\nThe direct standardized CFR for Hospital $X$, denoted $\\text{DS-CFR}_X$:\n$$\n\\text{DS-CFR}_X = (\\text{CFR}_{X,\\text{sev}} \\times w_{\\text{sev}}) + (\\text{CFR}_{X,\\text{mild}} \\times w_{\\text{mild}})\n$$\n$$\n\\text{DS-CFR}_X = (0.15 \\times 0.5) + (0.01 \\times 0.5) = 0.075 + 0.005 = 0.080\n$$\n\nThe direct standardized CFR for Hospital $Y$, denoted $\\text{DS-CFR}_Y$:\n$$\n\\text{DS-CFR}_Y = (\\text{CFR}_{Y,\\text{sev}} \\times w_{\\text{sev}}) + (\\text{CFR}_{Y,\\text{mild}} \\times w_{\\text{mild}})\n$$\n$$\n\\text{DS-CFR}_Y = (0.20 \\times 0.5) + (0.02 \\times 0.5) = 0.100 + 0.010 = 0.110\n$$\n\nThe final step is to compute the direct standardized case-fatality ratio of Hospital $X$ to Hospital $Y$.\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{DS-CFR}_X}{\\text{DS-CFR}_Y} = \\frac{0.080}{0.110} = \\frac{8}{11}\n$$\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $0.727272...$.\n\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.7273$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.7273}\n$$", "id": "4575382"}]}
