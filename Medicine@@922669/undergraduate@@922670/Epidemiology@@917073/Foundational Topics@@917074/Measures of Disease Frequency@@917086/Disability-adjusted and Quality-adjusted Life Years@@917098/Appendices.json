This requires a clear understanding of the definitions of DALYs and QALYs and a careful application of the provided mapping assumptions and discounting principles.\n\nFirst, let us state the core definitions. A DALY is a measure of overall disease burden, expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability, or early death. It is the sum of Years of Life Lost (YLL) and Years Lived with Disability (YLD):\n$$ \\text{DALY} = \\text{YLL} + \\text{YLD} $$\nA QALY is a measure of health outcome which looks at both quantity and quality of life.

The problem states that survivors have a baseline health-state utility of $u_b = 0.82$. Therefore, each year of life saved does not contribute $1$ QALY (which would imply perfect health), but rather $u_b$ QALYs. The QALY gain in year $t$ from averting $YLL_t$ years of life lost is:\n$$ QALY_{YLL, t} = YLL_t \\times u_b $$\n\n$2$. **Conversion of YLD Averted to QALYs Gained**:\nAverting one YLD means preventing one year of life lived with a certain level of disability. This corresponds to an improvement in health-state utility. The problem provides a direct mapping: each unit of YLD averted corresponds to a utility improvement scaled by $\\alpha = 0.95$. This implies that the QALY gain for each unit of YLD averted is $\\alpha$. The QALY gain in year $t$ from averting $YLD_t$ years lived with disability is:\n$$ QALY_{YLD, t} = YLD_t \\times \\alpha $$\n\n$3$. **Total Undiscounted QALYs Gained per Year**:\nThe total undiscounted QALYs gained in year $t$ is the sum of these two components:\n$$ QALY_t = QALY_{YLL, t} + QALY_{YLD, t} = (YLL_t \\times u_b) + (YLD_t \\times \\alpha) $$\nThis is the required conversion expression.\n\nNow, we apply this expression to the given data to calculate the undiscounted QALYs for each year $t \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, using $u_b = 0.82$ and $\\alpha = 0.95$.\n- For $t=1$: $QALY_1 = (20 \\times 0.82) + (30 \\times 0.95) = 16.4 + 28.5 = 44.9$\n- For $t=2$: $QALY_2 = (25 \\times 0.82) + (35 \\times 0.95) = 20.5 + 33.25 = 53.75$\n- For $t=3$: $QALY_3 = (25 \\times 0.82) + (35 \\times 0.95) = 20.5 + 33.25 = 53.75$\n- For $t=4$: $QALY_4 = (20 \\times 0.82) + (30 \\times 0.95) = 16.4 + 28.5 = 44.9$\n- For $t=5$: $QALY_5 = (10 \\times 0.82) + (20 \\times 0.95) = 8.2 + 19.0 = 27.2$\n\nThe next step is to compute the present value of these total QALYs gained. The problem specifies an annual discount rate of $r = 1.5\\% = 0.015$, with effects realized at the end of each year. The formula for the present value ($PV$) of a future stream of benefits is:\n$$ PV_{QALY} = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\frac{QALY_t}{(1+r)^t} $$\nFor $T=5$ years:\n$$ PV_{QALY} = \\frac{QALY_1}{(1+r)^1} + \\frac{QALY_2}{(1+r)^2} + \\frac{QALY_3}{(1+r)^3} + \\frac{QALY_4}{(1+r)^4} + \\frac{QALY_5}{(1+r)^5} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ PV_{QALY} = \\frac{44.9}{(1.015)^1} + \\frac{53.75}{(1.015)^2} + \\frac{53.75}{(1.015)^3} + \\frac{44.9}{(1.015)^4} + \\frac{27.2}{(1.015)^5} $$\n$$ PV_{QALY} \\approx 44.23645 + 52.17324 + 51.40221 + 42.30211 + 25.24767 $$\n$$ PV_{QALY} \\approx 215.36168 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $215.4$.\n\nFinally, we identify two conceptual pitfalls as requested.\n\n**Pitfall 1: Construct Differences and Value Judgments.**\nDALYs and QALYs are constructed on different philosophical foundations. DALYs are a \"health gap\" metric measuring loss from an ideal health state, with disability weights (DWs) often determined by expert panels or general population surveys on the perceived severity of diseases. QALYs are a \"health gain\" metric, with utility values based on individual preferences for different health states, typically measured through methods like the time trade-off or standard gamble. A core pitfall is to assume that these two value systems are directly interchangeable. The mapping in this problem, where a YLD averted is converted to a QALY gain via a scaling factor $\\alpha$, is a pragmatic simplification that masks a deep conceptual disparity. A disability weight $DW$ in the DALY framework does not necessarily equate to a utility loss of the same magnitude (i.e., $u = 1 - DW$) in the QALY framework. This conversion, therefore, bridges two distinct sets of value judgments about health and disability, which can lead to misinterpretation if the results are treated as equivalent to a pure QALY-based analysis.\n\n**Pitfall 2: Time-Preference Specifications and Discounting.**\nThe problem highlights that DALYs were reported with a $3\\%$ discount rate, while the QALYs are to be calculated with a $1.5\\%$ rate. This reflects different conventions in the field. The choice of a discount rate is a normative decision with significant ethical implications. A higher rate devalues future health benefits more heavily, potentially biasing decisions against preventative programs or interventions for the young, whose benefits accrue over a long period. The pitfall is not just the risk of inconsistent application, but the fundamental difference in what is being discounted. In DALYs, one discounts health itself. In QALYs, the practice is typically justified by analogy to economic time preference for consumption. Comparing cost-effectiveness results or policy thresholds (e.g., cost per DALY vs. cost per QALY) is fraught with difficulty when the underlying time-preference specifications differ. The choice of rate can alter the ranking of interventions, and the lack of a universally agreed-upon standard for both metrics complicates comparative analyses.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{215.4}$$", "id": "4587971"}]}
