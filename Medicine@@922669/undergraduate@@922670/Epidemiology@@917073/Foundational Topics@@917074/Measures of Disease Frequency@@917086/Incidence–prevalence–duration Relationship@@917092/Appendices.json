It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective problem statement rooted in fundamental principles of compartmental modeling in epidemiology. All necessary information is provided, and the problem is internally consistent.\n\nLet $N$ be the total population size, which is constant. Let $S(t)$ and $C(t)$ denote the number of non-diseased and diseased individuals at time $t$, respectively. By definition, $S(t) + C(t) = N$ for all $t$. The prevalence of the disease at time $t$ is $P(t) = \\frac{C(t)}{N}$.\n\nThe dynamics of the system are described by the rate of change in the number of diseased individuals, $\\frac{dC}{dt}$. This change is determined by the balance between the inflow into the diseased state (new cases) and the outflow from the diseased state (recovery or death).\n\nThe rate of new cases (inflow) is the product of the number of non-diseased individuals, $S(t)$, and the constant hazard of disease onset, $i$.\n$$\n\\text{Inflow rate} = i S(t)\n$$\nThe rate of exit from the diseased state (outflow) is the product of the number of diseased individuals, $C(t)$, and the constant hazard of exit, $\\mu$.\n$$\n\\text{Outflow rate} = \\mu C(t)\n$$\nThe mass balance equation for the diseased compartment is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = i S(t) - \\mu C(t)\n$$\nSubstituting $S(t) = N - C(t)$, we obtain the differential equation governing the number of diseased individuals:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = i(N - C(t)) - \\mu C(t) = iN - (i + \\mu)C(t)\n$$\n\nFirst, we derive the exact expression for the steady-state prevalence, $P^{\\ast}$. At steady state, the number of individuals in each state is constant, which implies that the net rate of change is zero. Let $C^{\\ast}$ be the number of diseased individuals at steady state. Setting $\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0$:\n$$\n0 = i(N - C^{\\ast}) - \\mu C^{\\ast}\n$$\nThis equation expresses the steady-state condition: inflow equals outflow.\n$$\ni(N - C^{\\ast}) = \\mu C^{\\ast}\n$$\nWe solve for $C^{\\ast}$:\n$$\niN - iC^{\\ast} = \\mu C^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\niN = (i + \\mu)C^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\nC^{\\ast} = \\frac{iN}{i + \\mu}\n$$\nThe steady-state prevalence $P^{\\ast}$ is defined as $P^{\\ast} = \\frac{C^{\\ast}}{N}$.\n$$\nP^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{N} \\left( \\frac{iN}{i + \\mu} \\right) = \\frac{i}{i + \\mu}\n$$\nThe problem provides the mean duration of disease, $D$, which is related to the exit hazard $\\mu$ by $D = \\frac{1}{\\mu}$.

This approximation is based on the condition that the disease is rare, meaning the steady-state prevalence $P^{\\ast}$ is small ($P^{\\ast} \\ll 1$). If $P^{\\ast}$ is small, then the number of diseased individuals $C^{\\ast}$ is much smaller than the total population $N$.
