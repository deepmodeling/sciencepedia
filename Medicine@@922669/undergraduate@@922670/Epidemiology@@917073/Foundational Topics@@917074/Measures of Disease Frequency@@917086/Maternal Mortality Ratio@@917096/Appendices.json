It is free of ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. The constraints on $\\delta$ ($0 \\leq \\delta < 1$) and $\\epsilon$ ($\\epsilon \\geq 0$) are consistent with their definitions as factors for undercounting and overcounting, respectively, and ensure that the denominators in the final expression are non-zero.
