The population at risk is defined as all residents aged $35$ to $74$ years with no prior myocardial infarction who reside within the city limits at the time of observation; individuals who experience their first event are removed from the population at risk at the time of the event. Let $P(t)$ denote the instantaneous size of the population at risk at time $t$ measured in years, and let total person-time at risk over a period be the time integral of $P(t)$ across that period.\n\nThe department has reliable annual mid-year census counts for the population at risk for the calendar years $2016$ through $2020$.

Do not round the final value.", "solution": "The problem asks for a derivation and calculation of the total person-time at risk over a five-year period, based on a set of annual mid-year population counts. The solution proceeds by first formalizing the concept of person-time as an integral, then using the provided linearity assumption to approximate this integral.\n\nLet $P(t)$ be the size of the population at risk at time $t$, where $t$ is measured in years. The problem specifies a $5$-year interval from the start of calendar year $2016$ to the end of calendar year $2020$. We can define a time axis where $t=2016.0$ represents the start of the year $2016$, $t=2017.0$ represents the start of $2017$, and so on, until $t=2021.0$, which represents the end of $2020$. The time interval of interest is therefore $[2016, 2021]$.\n\nThe fundamental definition of total person-time at risk, which we will denote as $PT_{total}$, over this interval is the time integral of the population-at-risk function $P(t)$:\n$$ PT_{total} = \\int_{2016}^{2021} P(t) dt $$\n\nTo utilize the annual data, we can decompose this integral into a sum of integrals over each of the five calendar years:\n$$ PT_{total} = \\int_{2016}^{2017} P(t) dt + \\int_{2017}^{2018} P(t) dt + \\int_{2018}^{2019} P(t) dt + \\int_{2019}^{2020} P(t) dt + \\int_{2020}^{2021} P(t) dt $$\nThis can be expressed more compactly as:\n$$ PT_{total} = \\sum_{y=2016}^{2020} \\int_{y}^{y+1} P(t) dt $$\n\nThe problem states the key assumption that within each calendar year, the population function $P(t)$ is well-approximated by a linear function of time. Let us analyze the integral for a single year $y$, corresponding to the time interval $[y, y+1]$. Let $P_y(t)$ be the linear approximation of $P(t)$ over this interval. The person-time for that year, $PT_y$, is:\n$$ PT_y = \\int_{y}^{y+1} P_y(t) dt $$\nA property of any linear function, $f(x) = mx+c$, integrated over an interval $[a, b]$ is that the value of the integral is equal to the length of the interval multiplied by the value of the function at the midpoint of the interval. That is:\n$$ \\int_a^b f(x) dx = (b-a) \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right) $$\nTo demonstrate this, we evaluate the integral:\n$$ \\int_a^b (mx+c) dx = \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}mx^2 + cx \\right]_a^b = \\frac{1}{2}m(b^2-a^2) + c(b-a) = (b-a) \\left( \\frac{1}{2}m(b+a) + c \\right) $$\nThe value of the function at the midpoint $\\frac{a+b}{2}$ is $f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right) = m\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right) + c$. Thus, the identity is proven.\n\nFor the year $y$, the time interval is $[y, y+1]$. The length of this interval is $(y+1) - y = 1$ year. The midpoint of the interval is $t = \\frac{y+(y+1)}{2} = y+0.5$. The problem provides the annual mid-year census count, $M_y$, which is the population size at this midpoint. Therefore, $M_y = P(y+0.5)$. Applying the property of linear functions:\n$$ PT_y = \\int_{y}^{y+1} P_y(t) dt = \\left((y+1)-y\\right) \\cdot P_y(y+0.5) = 1 \\cdot M_y = M_y $$\nThe unit of $PT_y$ is person-years, as it is the product of population size (persons) and time (years).\n\nThis derivation provides the approximation for the total person-time at risk: it is the sum of the mid-year population counts over the observation period.\n$$ PT_{total} \\approx \\sum_{y=2016}^{2020} M_y $$\nThe problem requires us to evaluate this approximation using the provided data:\n- $M_{2016} = 10240$\n- $M_{2017} = 10360$\n- $M_{2018} = 10550$\n- $M_{2019} = 10430$\n- $M_{2020} = 10390$\n\nWe now compute the sum:\n$$ PT_{total} \\approx 10240 + 10360 + 10550 + 10430 + 10390 $$\nPerforming the addition:\n$$ PT_{total} \\approx 20600 + 10550 + 10430 + 10390 $$\n$$ PT_{total} \\approx 31150 + 10430 + 10390 $$\n$$ PT_{total} \\approx 41580 + 10390 $$\n$$ PT_{total} \\approx 51970 $$\n\nThe total person-time at risk over the $5$-year interval, under the given assumption, is approximated as $51970$ person-years.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{51970} $$", "id": "4643084"}, {"introduction": "Moving from population-level estimates to individual-level cohort data requires a more precise approach to calculating person-time.
