The problem is deemed valid.\n\nWe will proceed with the five-part solution as requested. Let $j$ denote the country, where $j \\in \\{A, B\\}$, and let $i$ be the index for the age stratum, where $i=1$ for ages 0–49 and $i=2$ for ages $\\geq 50$. We denote the number of deaths as $D_{j,i}$, the population as $N_{j,i}$, and the standard population as $N_{S,i}$.\n\n**1. Computation of Age-Specific Cause-Specific Mortality Rates**\n\nThe age-specific cause-specific mortality rate, $m_{j,i}$, for country $j$ and age group $i$ is calculated as the number of deaths in that group divided by the population of that group, typically expressed per $100{,}000$ persons. The formula is:\n$$m_{j,i} = \\frac{D_{j,i}}{N_{j,i}} \\times 100{,}000$$\n\nFor Country $A$:\n- Ages 0–49 ($i=1$): $D_{A,1} = 450$, $N_{A,1} = 900{,}000$.\n  $$m_{A,1} = \\frac{450}{900{,}000} \\times 100{,}000 = 0.0005 \\times 100{,}000 = 50 \\text{ per } 100{,}000$$\n- Ages $\\geq 50$ ($i=2$): $D_{A,2} = 500$, $N_{A,2} = 100{,}000$.\n  $$m_{A,2} = \\frac{500}{100{,}000} \\times 100{,}000 = 0.005 \\times 100{,}000 = 500 \\text{ per } 100{,}000$$\n\nFor Country $B$:\n- Ages 0–49 ($i=1$): $D_{B,1} = 90$, $N_{B,1} = 300{,}000$.\n  $$m_{B,1} = \\frac{90}{300{,}000} \\times 100{,}000 = 0.0003 \\times 100{,}000 = 30 \\text{ per } 100{,}000$$\n- Ages $\\geq 50$ ($i=2$): $D_{B,2} = 2{,}800$, $N_{B,2} = 700{,}000$.\n  $$m_{B,2} = \\frac{2{,}800}{700{,}000} \\times 100{,}000 = 0.004 \\times 100{,}000 = 400 \\text{ per } 100{,}000$$\n\nA comparison of these age-specific rates shows that Country $A$ has a higher mortality rate than Country $B$ in both age strata ($m_{A,1} > m_{B,1}$ and $m_{A,2} > m_{B,2}$).\n\n**2. Computation of Crude Cause-Specific Mortality Rates**\n\nThe crude cause-specific mortality rate ($CMR$) is the total number of cause-specific deaths divided by the total population, expressed per $100{,}000$.\n$$CMR_j = \\frac{\\sum_{i} D_{j,i}}{\\sum_{i} N_{j,i}} \\times 100{,}000$$\n\nFor Country $A$:\n- Total deaths: $D_A = 450 + 500 = 950$.\n- Total population: $N_A = 900{,}000 + 100{,}000 = 1{,}000{,}000$.\n  $$CMR_A = \\frac{950}{1{,}000{,}000} \\times 100{,}000 = 95 \\text{ per } 100{,}000$$\n\nFor Country $B$:\n- Total deaths: $D_B = 90 + 2{,}800 = 2{,}890$.\n- Total population: $N_B = 300{,}000 + 700{,}000 = 1{,}000{,}000$.\n  $$CMR_B = \\frac{2{,}890}{1{,}000{,}000} \\times 100{,}000 = 289 \\text{ per } 100{,}000$$\n\nBased on crude rates, $CMR_B$ ($289$) is substantially higher than $CMR_A$ ($95$). This finding suggests that Country $B$ has a higher overall mortality from ischemic heart disease.\n\n**3. Direct Age Standardization**\n\nDirect age standardization computes the overall mortality rate that would be observed in the study populations if they had the same age structure as a standard population. The age-standardized mortality rate ($ASMR$) is the sum of the expected deaths in each age stratum divided by the total standard population.\nThe expected number of deaths for country $j$ in stratum $i$ is $E_{j,i} = (\\frac{D_{j,i}}{N_{j,i}}) \\times N_{S,i}$.\nThe $ASMR_j$ is then:\n$$ASMR_j = \\frac{\\sum_i E_{j,i}}{\\sum_i N_{S,i}} \\times 100{,}000$$\nThe standard population is given as $N_{S,1} = 500{,}000$ and $N_{S,2} = 500{,}000$, so the total standard population is $N_S = 1{,}000{,}000$.\n\nFor Country $A$:\n- Expected deaths in stratum $1$: $E_{A,1} = \\frac{450}{900{,}000} \\times 500{,}000 = 250$.\n- Expected deaths in stratum $2$: $E_{A,2} = \\frac{500}{100{,}000} \\times 500{,}000 = 2{,}500$.\n- Total expected deaths: $E_A = 250 + 2{,}500 = 2{,}750$.\n  $$ASMR_A = \\frac{2{,}750}{1{,}000{,}000} \\times 100{,}000 = 275 \\text{ per } 100{,}000$$\n\nFor Country $B$:\n- Expected deaths in stratum $1$: $E_{B,1} = \\frac{90}{300{,}000} \\times 500{,}000 = 150$.\n- Expected deaths in stratum $2$: $E_{B,2} = \\frac{2{,}800}{700{,}000} \\times 500{,}000 = 2{,}000$.\n- Total expected deaths: $E_B = 150 + 2{,}000 = 2{,}150$.\n  $$ASMR_B = \\frac{2{,}150}{1{,}000{,}000} \\times 100{,}000 = 215 \\text{ per } 100{,}000$$\n\n**4. Demonstration of Simpson's Paradox**\n\nWe now compare the conclusions from the crude and standardized rates.\n- Crude Rate Comparison: $CMR_A = 95  CMR_B = 289$. This implies mortality is lower in Country $A$.\n- Standardized Rate Comparison: $ASMR_A = 275 > ASMR_B = 215$. This implies mortality is higher in Country $A$.\n\nThe direction of the comparison is reversed ($ \\rightarrow >$), which numerically demonstrates Simpson's paradox. The crude rates are confounded by the different age structures of the two countries. Country $A$ has a predominantly young population ($90\\%$ in the low-risk 0–49 age group), which artificially lowers its crude rate. Country $B$ has an older population ($70\\%$ in the high-risk $\\geq 50$ age group), which inflates its crude rate. Standardization removes this confounding effect, revealing that Country $A$ has higher underlying age-specific mortality rates.\n\n**5. Age-Standardized Rate Ratio**\n\nThe final task is to compute the age-standardized rate ratio ($SRR$) of Country $A$ to Country $B$.\n$$SRR_{A:B} = \\frac{ASMR_A}{ASMR_B}$$\n$$SRR_{A:B} = \\frac{275}{215} \\approx 1.2790697...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio is $1.279$. This indicates that after adjusting for age, the mortality rate from ischemic heart disease in Country $A$ is approximately $1.279$ times the rate in Country $B$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.279}\n$$", "id": "4576362"}, {"introduction": "After mastering age standardization, we can confidently compare cause-specific mortality rates, but how do these different causes of death interact within a single population?

In the baseline year, the numbers of deaths are: circulatory $D_{\\text{circ},0}(a) = 300$, malignant neoplasms $D_{\\text{neop},0}(a) = 250$, external causes $D_{\\text{ext},0}(a) = 50$, and other causes $D_{\\text{other},0}(a) = 100$.

In this problem, observing only $D_k = 3$ deaths is an instance of sparse data. The resulting confidence interval, $[1.237 \\times 10^{-5}, 1.753 \\times 10^{-4}]$, reveals two key implications of this sparsity:\n\n1.  **Asymmetry**: The interval is highly asymmetric around the point estimate of the rate, $\\hat{m} = D_k/PT = 3/50{,}000 = 6.0 \\times 10^{-5}$. The upper limit ($17.53 \\times 10^{-5}$) is much farther from the point estimate than the lower limit ($1.237 \\times 10^{-5}$). This asymmetry is a characteristic feature of exact intervals for Poisson rates when counts are low, correctly reflecting the right-skewed nature of the underlying Poisson distribution and its parameter estimation. A symmetric approximation (e.g., Wald interval) would be inappropriate and could even yield a non-physical negative lower bound.\n\n2.  **Imprecision (Wide Interval)**: The confidence interval is extremely wide, spanning more than an order of magnitude. The ratio of the upper bound to the lower bound is $\\frac{1.753 \\times 10^{-4}}{1.237 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 14.17$. This vast range indicates a high degree of uncertainty about the true underlying mortality rate. With only three events, the data provide very little statistical information, leading to an estimate with low precision. The interval shows that while our best guess for the rate is $6.0 \\times 10^{-5}$, the true rate could plausibly be as low as $1.2 \\times 10^{-5}$ or as high as $17.5 \\times 10^{-5}$. This instability is a direct consequence of the sparse data; each single observed event has a disproportionately large impact on the estimate and its uncertainty.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1.237 \\times 10^{-5}  1.753 \\times 10^{-4} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4576370"}]}
