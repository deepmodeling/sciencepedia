A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nLet $P$ be the true, unknown prevalence of the chronic condition in the finite population of $N$ adults. This is the parameter of interest. $P$ is the proportion of a binary characteristic, so it can be defined as the mean of indicator variables. Let $Y_i = 1$ if person $i$ has the condition and $Y_i = 0$ otherwise, for $i = 1, \\dots, N$. The population prevalence is $P = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_i$.\n\nA simple random sample of size $n$ is drawn without replacement. Let $y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n$ be the indicator variables for the individuals in the sample. The sample prevalence, $\\hat{p}$, is the natural estimator for $P$. It is the sample mean of the indicator variables:\n$$ \\hat{p} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} y_j $$\nFrom the given data, a total of $x = 312$ individuals in the sample of size $n = 2{,}400$ have the condition. Thus, the sample prevalence is:\n$$ \\hat{p} = \\frac{x}{n} = \\frac{312}{2{,}400} = 0.13 $$\n\nThe problem requires deriving the standard error of $\\hat{p}$. According to the theory of simple random sampling without replacement, the variance of the sample mean, $\\hat{p}$, is given by:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\hat{p}) = \\left( \\frac{N-n}{N} \\right) \\frac{S^2}{n} $$\nwhere $S^2$ is the finite population variance, defined as $S^2 = \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (Y_i - P)^2$. The term $\\frac{N-n}{N} = 1 - \\frac{n}{N}$ is the finite population correction (FPC) factor. For a binary variable $Y_i$, the population variance $S^2$ simplifies to:\n$$ S^2 = \\frac{N}{N-1} P(1-P) $$\nThe variance of $\\hat{p}$ is therefore $\\text{Var}(\\hat{p}) = \\left( \\frac{N-n}{N} \\right) \\frac{1}{n} \\frac{N}{N-1} P(1-P) = \\frac{N-n}{n(N-1)} P(1-P)$.\n\nTo construct a confidence interval, we need an estimate of this variance, which in turn requires an estimate of its square root, the standard error $\\text{SE}(\\hat{p})$. We can estimate the unknown variance term $P(1-P)$ using the sample data. A consistent estimator for the population variance $S^2$ is the sample variance $s^2$:\n$$ s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (y_j - \\hat{p})^2 $$\nFor binary data, this simplifies to $s^2 = \\frac{n}{n-1} \\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})$. By substituting $s^2$ for $S^2$ in the variance formula, we obtain an estimator for the variance of $\\hat{p}$:\n$$ \\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{p}) = \\left( 1 - \\frac{n}{N} \\right) \\frac{s^2}{n} = \\left( 1 - \\frac{n}{N} \\right) \\frac{1}{n} \\left( \\frac{n}{n-1} \\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p}) \\right) = \\left( 1 - \\frac{n}{N} \\right) \\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n-1} $$\nThe approximate standard error of the sample prevalence, $\\text{SE}(\\hat{p})$, is the square root of this estimated variance:\n$$ \\text{SE}(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{p})} = \\sqrt{\\left( 1 - \\frac{n}{N} \\right) \\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n-1}} $$\nThis expression incorporates the finite population correction as required.\n\nBased on the large-sample normal approximation, an approximate two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval for the population prevalence $P$ is given by:\n$$ \\hat{p} \\pm z_{1-0.05/2} \\times \\text{SE}(\\hat{p}) $$\nwhere $z_{1-0.05/2} = z_{0.975}$ is the $0.975$ quantile of the standard normal distribution. The value of $z_{0.975}$ is approximately $1.96$.\n\nThe total width, $W$, of this confidence interval is the difference between the upper and lower bounds:\n$$ W = \\left( \\hat{p} + z_{0.975} \\text{SE}(\\hat{p}) \\right) - \\left( \\hat{p} - z_{0.975} \\text{SE}(\\hat{p}) \\right) = 2 z_{0.975} \\text{SE}(\\hat{p}) $$\nSubstituting the derived expression for the standard error:\n$$ W = 2 z_{0.975} \\sqrt{\\left( 1 - \\frac{n}{N} \\right) \\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n-1}} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $N = 120{,}000$\n- $n = 2{,}400$\n- $\\hat{p} = 0.13$\n- $z_{0.975} \\approx 1.96$\n\nFirst, calculate the FPC factor:\n$$ 1 - \\frac{n}{N} = 1 - \\frac{2{,}400}{120{,}000} = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98 $$\nNext, calculate the variance component:\n$$ \\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n-1} = \\frac{0.13 \\times (1-0.13)}{2{,}400-1} = \\frac{0.13 \\times 0.87}{2{,}399} = \\frac{0.1131}{2{,}399} $$\nNow, compute the standard error:\n$$ \\text{SE}(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{0.98 \\times \\frac{0.1131}{2{,}399}} = \\sqrt{0.98 \\times 0.00004714464...} = \\sqrt{0.00004620175...} \\approx 0.006797187 $$\nFinally, calculate the total width of the CI:\n$$ W = 2 \\times 1.96 \\times 0.006797187... = 3.92 \\times 0.006797187... \\approx 0.02664497... $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $0.02664$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.02664}\n$$", "id": "4639611"}, {"introduction": "A primary use of cross-sectional data is to compare the prevalence of a condition between different groups, but such comparisons are fraught with potential biases.

The data is internally consistent and does not violate any mathematical or logical principles. The scenario, including the presence of Simpson's paradox, is a classic and realistic teaching example in epidemiology. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to solve it.\n\nThe solution requires calculating the age-standardized prevalence for both the exposed and unexposed groups and then finding their ratio. This process begins by calculating the stratum-specific prevalences.\n\nLet $P(C|E, Y)$ be the prevalence of the condition ($C$) among the exposed ($E$) who are young ($Y$). Similarly, we define $P(C|E, O)$, $P(C|U, Y)$, and $P(C|U, O)$ for the other three subgroups.\n\nThe stratum-specific prevalences are calculated as follows:\n1.  Prevalence in exposed, young group:\n    $$P(C|E, Y) = \\frac{C_{E,Y}}{N_{E,Y}} = \\frac{16}{200} = 0.08$$\n2.  Prevalence in exposed, old group:\n    $$P(C|E, O) = \\frac{C_{E,O}}{N_{E,O}} = \\frac{280}{800} = 0.35$$\n3.  Prevalence in unexposed, young group:\n    $$P(C|U, Y) = \\frac{C_{U,Y}}{N_{U,Y}} = \\frac{80}{800} = 0.10$$\n4.  Prevalence in unexposed, old group:\n    $$P(C|U, O) = \\frac{C_{U,O}}{N_{U,O}} = \\frac{80}{200} = 0.40$$\n\nNext, we apply the method of direct standardization. This involves creating a weighted average of the stratum-specific prevalences for each exposure group, using the weights from a common standard population. The problem specifies a standard population with equal weights for the young and old strata: $w_{\\text{young}} = 0.5$ and $w_{\\text{old}} = 0.5$.\n\nThe age-standardized prevalence for the exposed group, $P_{\\text{std, E}}$, is calculated using the law of total probability with the standard weights:\n$$P_{\\text{std, E}} = w_{\\text{young}} \\times P(C|E, Y) + w_{\\text{old}} \\times P(C|E, O)$$\n$$P_{\\text{std, E}} = (0.5 \\times 0.08) + (0.5 \\times 0.35) = 0.040 + 0.175 = 0.215$$\n\nSimilarly, the age-standardized prevalence for the unexposed group, $P_{\\text{std, U}}$, is:\n$$P_{\\text{std, U}} = w_{\\text{young}} \\times P(C|U, Y) + w_{\\text{old}} \\times P(C|U, O)$$\n$$P_{\\text{std, U}} = (0.5 \\times 0.10) + (0.5 \\times 0.40) = 0.050 + 0.200 = 0.250$$\n\nFinally, the directly age-standardized prevalence ratio (SPR) is the ratio of the standardized prevalence in the exposed group to that in the unexposed group.\n$$\\text{SPR} = \\frac{P_{\\text{std, E}}}{P_{\\text{std, U}}}$$\n$$\\text{SPR} = \\frac{0.215}{0.250} = 0.86$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.
