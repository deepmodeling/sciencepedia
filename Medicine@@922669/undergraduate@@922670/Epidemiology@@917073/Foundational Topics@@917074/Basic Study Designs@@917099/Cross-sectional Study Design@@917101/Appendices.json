Let $E \\in \\{1,0\\}$ denote exposure (exposed, unexposed) and $Y \\in \\{1,0\\}$ denote current wheeze (present, absent).

It is self-contained, consistent, and scientifically grounded in the principles of epidemiology and statistics. All necessary data and definitions are provided for a unique solution. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and computation.\n\nThe problem requires a step-by-step derivation and calculation of several epidemiological measures from cross-sectional data. We are given the counts of individuals in a $2 \\times 2$ table format, classified by exposure status ($E$) and disease status ($Y$):\n- $a = 84$: Exposed ($E=1$) and have current wheeze ($Y=1$).\n- $b = 316$: Exposed ($E=1$) and do not have current wheeze ($Y=0$).\n- $c = 46$: Unexposed ($E=0$) and have current wheeze ($Y=1$).\n- $d = 554$: Unexposed ($E=0$) and do not have current wheeze ($Y=0$).\n\n1. The target parameters are defined as follows:\n- The prevalence of wheeze in the exposed group: $p_1 = P(Y=1 \\mid E=1)$.\n- The prevalence of wheeze in the unexposed group: $p_0 = P(Y=1 \\mid E=0)$.\n- The prevalence ratio: $PR = p_1 / p_0$.\n- The prevalence difference: $PD = p_1 - p_0$.\n- The prevalence odds ratio: $POR = \\dfrac{p_1/(1-p_1)}{p_0/(1-p_0)}$.\n\n2. We derive the estimators. The problem specifies conditioning on the total number of exposed individuals, $n_1 = a+b$, and the total number of unexposed individuals, $n_0 = c+d$.\nThe total number of exposed individuals is $n_1 = 84 + 316 = 400$.\nThe total number of unexposed individuals is $n_0 = 46 + 554 = 600$.\n\nWithin the stratum of $n_1$ exposed individuals, the number who have wheeze, $a$, can be modeled as a realization of a binomial random variable, $A$. The random variable $A$ follows a binomial distribution $A \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n_1, p_1)$, where $p_1$ is the true prevalence of wheeze in the exposed population. The standard unbiased estimator for the binomial probability parameter $p_1$ is the sample proportion.\nThus, the estimator for $p_1$ is:\n$$ \\hat{p}_1 = \\frac{a}{n_1} = \\frac{a}{a+b} $$\nThe expectation of this estimator is $E[\\hat{p}_1] = E[A/n_1] = (1/n_1) E[A] = (1/n_1)(n_1 p_1) = p_1$, confirming it is an unbiased estimator.\n\nSimilarly, within the stratum of $n_0$ unexposed individuals, the number who have wheeze, $c$, is a realization of a binomial random variable $C \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n_0, p_0)$. The unbiased estimator for the prevalence $p_0$ is the sample proportion:\n$$ \\hat{p}_0 = \\frac{c}{n_0} = \\frac{c}{c+d} $$\nThe expectation is $E[\\hat{p}_0] = E[C/n_0] = (1/n_0) E[C] = (1/n_0)(n_0 p_0) = p_0$, also confirming unbiasedness.\n\nThe estimators for the measures of association ($PR$, $PD$, $POR$) are obtained by the plug-in principle, which involves substituting the estimators $\\hat{p}_1$ and $\\hat{p}_0$ into the definitions of the parameters:\n- Estimator for Prevalence Ratio: $\\widehat{PR} = \\dfrac{\\hat{p}_1}{\\hat{p}_0}$.\n- Estimator for Prevalence Difference: $\\widehat{PD} = \\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_0$.\n- Estimator for Prevalence Odds Ratio: $\\widehat{POR} = \\dfrac{\\hat{p}_1/(1-\\hat{p}_1)}{\\hat{p}_0/(1-\\hat{p}_0)}$.\n\nThe estimator for the prevalence odds ratio can be simplified by substituting the expressions for the sample proportions. The sample odds of wheeze among the exposed is:\n$$ \\frac{\\hat{p}_1}{1-\\hat{p}_1} = \\frac{a/(a+b)}{1 - a/(a+b)} = \\frac{a/(a+b)}{b/(a+b)} = \\frac{a}{b} $$\nThe sample odds of wheeze among the unexposed is:\n$$ \\frac{\\hat{p}_0}{1-\\hat{p}_0} = \\frac{c/(c+d)}{1 - c/(c+d)} = \\frac{c/(c+d)}{d/(c+d)} = \\frac{c}{d} $$\nTherefore, the estimator for the prevalence odds ratio is the cross-product ratio from the $2 \\times 2$ table:\n$$ \\widehat{POR} = \\frac{a/b}{c/d} = \\frac{ad}{bc} $$\n\n3.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Option Evaluation\n\nFirst, I will calculate the key measures of association from the provided data: prevalence, prevalence ratio (PR), odds, and odds ratio (OR).\n\nLet $P_{low}$ be the prevalence of inactivity in the low-walkability group and $P_{high}$ be the prevalence in the high-walkability group.\n-   Prevalence in the low-walkability group:\n    $$P_{low} = \\frac{d_{low}}{n_{low}} = \\frac{320}{800} = 0.40$$\n-   Prevalence in the high-walkability group:\n    $$P_{high} = \\frac{d_{high}}{n_{high}} = \\frac{240}{1200} = 0.20$$\n\nThe outcome prevalence in both groups ($40\\%$ and $20\\%$) is common, not rare.\n\n-   The sample **Prevalence Ratio (PR)** is:\n    $$PR = \\frac{P_{low}}{P_{high}} = \\frac{0.40}{0.20} = 2.00$$\n\nNext, we calculate the odds for each group. The odds of an event is the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring, $Odds = P / (1-P)$.\n-   Odds of inactivity in the low-walkability group:\n    $$Odds_{low} = \\frac{P_{low}}{1 - P_{low}} = \\frac{0.40}{1 - 0.40} = \\frac{0.40}{0.60} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n-   Odds of inactivity in the high-walkability group:\n    $$Odds_{high} = \\frac{P_{high}}{1 - P_{high}} = \\frac{0.20}{1 - 0.20} = \\frac{0.20}{0.80} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\n-   The sample **Odds Ratio (OR)** is:\n    $$OR = \\frac{Odds_{low}}{Odds_{high}} = \\frac{2/3}{1/4} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 4 = \\frac{8}{3} \\approx 2.666...$$\n\nNow, I will evaluate each option.\n\n**Option A:** Using the data provided, the sample odds ratio comparing low- versus high-walkability neighborhoods is approximately $2.67$, whereas the sample prevalence ratio is $2.00$, illustrating that for common outcomes the odds ratio can overstate the magnitude of association relative to the prevalence ratio.\n\nMy calculations show the sample PR is exactly $2.00$ and the sample OR is approximately $2.67$. The statement's numerical values are correct. The conclusion is that for common outcomes (here, $20\\%$ and $40\\%$), the OR overstates the magnitude of the PR ($2.67 > 2.00$). This is a well-known mathematical property: when the relative risk (or PR) is greater than $1$, the OR is always greater than the RR, and the divergence increases as the baseline prevalence increases. The statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B:** In cross-sectional studies, if the outcome prevalence exceeds $10\\%$, the odds ratio from logistic regression can be interpreted as a risk ratio without material error.\n\nThis statement is the inverse of the actual epidemiological rule of thumb. The odds ratio approximates the risk ratio (or prevalence ratio) only when the outcome is rare, typically taken to mean a prevalence of *less than* $10\\%$. When the prevalence exceeds $10\\%$, as in the data provided, the OR and PR diverge significantly. As shown in option A, with prevalences of $20\\%$ and $40\\%$, the OR ($2.67$) is substantially different from the PR ($2.00$). Hence, interpreting the OR as a PR in this scenario would lead to material error.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C:** In cross-sectional analyses, odds ratios are non-collapsible; including non-confounding covariates can change the estimated odds ratio even when there is no confounding, which complicates interpretation compared with prevalence ratios.\n\nThis statement addresses the property of collapsibility. An effect measure is collapsible if the marginal (crude) measure is a simple weighted average of the conditional (stratum-specific) measures. The prevalence ratio and prevalence difference are collapsible. The odds ratio is non-collapsible. This means that if one conditions on a variable that is associated with the outcome but not the exposure (and is therefore not a confounder), the conditional odds ratio will differ from the marginal odds ratio. In a logistic regression model, adding such a non-confounding covariate can change the coefficient for the exposure of interest. This mathematical property complicates the interpretation of an odds ratio from a multivariable model, as its value depends on the other covariates in the model, even if they are not confounders.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option D:** A binomial Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a log link (log-binomial regression) targets the prevalence ratio directly; however, it can experience convergence issues, particularly when estimated probabilities approach $1$.\n\nA binomial GLM models the probability of a binary outcome, $p = P(Y=1)$. With a log link, the model is $\\log(p) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X$ for a binary exposure $X$. The ratio of prevalences is then $p_1/p_0 = \\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1) / \\exp(\\beta_0) = \\exp(\\beta_1)$. Thus, $\\exp(\\beta_1)$ directly estimates the PR. This part is correct. The model requires that the linear predictor, $\\eta = \\log(p)$, must be $\\le 0$ to ensure that the fitted probability $p = \\exp(\\eta)$ is $\\le 1$. Optimization algorithms like Newton-Raphson can fail to converge if they attempt to step into the invalid parameter space where $\\eta > 0$ for any observation. This issue becomes more likely when some individuals have a high predicted probability of the outcome (i.e., close to $1$). The statement is a correct description of the log-binomial model and its primary practical limitation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option E:** A Poisson Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a log link applied to binary outcomes, combined with Huber-White robust variance estimators (sandwich), can consistently estimate prevalence ratios and often converges more reliably than log-binomial regression.\n\nThis describes a widely used alternative to log-binomial regression. Applying a Poisson GLM with a log link to a binary outcome means we are modeling $\\log(E[Y]) = \\log(p) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X$. As in the log-binomial model, $\\exp(\\beta_1)$ is the PR. While the binomial distribution is misspecified as Poisson, the estimating equations for the regression coefficients are unbiased, leading to a consistent point estimate of the PR. However, the standard errors will be incorrect because the Poisson variance assumption ($Var(Y)=\\mu=p$) is wrong for a binary outcome ($Var(Y)=p(1-p)$). The Huber-White robust variance estimator (or sandwich estimator) corrects for this model misspecification and provides consistent variance estimates. This combination is known to be numerically more stable and converge more reliably than log-binomial regression.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option F:** A linear probability model estimated by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) targets the prevalence difference (an absolute effect), which can be a valid alternative effect measure in cross-sectional studies, but it does not yield prevalence ratios.\n\nA linear probability model regressions the probability $p$ directly onto the covariates: $p = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X$. For a binary exposure $X$, the coefficient $\\beta_1$ represents the difference in probabilities, $p_1 - p_0$, which is the prevalence difference (an absolute measure), not the prevalence ratio (a relative measure). The prevalence difference is a perfectly valid and often highly interpretable measure of effect. The statement accurately describes what this model estimates and correctly distinguishes it from models that estimate ratios.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option G:** Using a Gaussian (normal) GLM with a log link and robust variance is appropriate for binary outcomes and will produce valid prevalence ratio estimates because the log link constrains fitted values to lie between $0$ and $1$.\n\nThis statement contains a critical flaw. A GLM with a log link models the log of the mean: $\\log(\\mu) = \\eta$, where $\\eta$ is the linear predictor. The fitted mean is therefore $\\hat{\\mu} = \\exp(\\hat{\\eta})$. Since the linear predictor $\\hat{\\eta}$ can take any value on the real line $(-\\infty, \\infty)$, the fitted mean $\\hat{\\mu}$ can take any value on the positive real line $(0, \\infty)$. The log link does *not* constrain the fitted values to be less than $1$. It is the *logit* link, $g(p) = \\log(p/(1-p))$, whose inverse function (the logistic function) maps the real line to the $(0, 1)$ interval, thereby constraining fitted probabilities. The central justification provided in the statement is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACDEF}$$", "id": "4517813"}]}
