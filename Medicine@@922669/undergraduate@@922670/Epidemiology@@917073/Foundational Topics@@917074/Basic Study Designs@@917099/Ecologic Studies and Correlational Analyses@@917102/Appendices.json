The expected deaths are calculated by applying the age-specific mortality rates from a standard population (in this case, the national population) to the age structure of the study population (region $g$). The formula is:\n$$ SMR_g = \\frac{O_g}{E_g} $$\nAn $SMR$ value of $1$ indicates that the mortality in the study population is the same as in the standard population, after accounting for age differences. An $SMR > 1$ indicates excess mortality (excess risk), while an $SMR < 1$ indicates lower-than-expected mortality (deficit risk or protective effect).\n\nWe calculate the SMR for each of the $G=5$ regions using the provided data.\n\nFor Region $1$:\n$$ SMR_1 = \\frac{O_1}{E_1} = \\frac{145}{130} \\approx 1.1154 $$\nSince $SMR_1 > 1$, Region $1$ experienced approximately $11.5\\%$ more deaths than would be expected based on national rates, indicating an excess mortality risk.\n\nFor Region $2$:\n$$ SMR_2 = \\frac{O_2}{E_2} = \\frac{98}{110} \\approx 0.8909 $$\nSince $SMR_2 < 1$, Region $2$ experienced approximately $10.9\\%$ fewer deaths than expected, indicating a deficit risk.\n\nFor Region $3$:\n$$ SMR_3 = \\frac{O_3}{E_3} = \\frac{210}{190} \\approx 1.1053 $$\nSince $SMR_3 > 1$, Region $3$ experienced approximately $10.5\\%$ more deaths than expected, indicating an excess mortality risk.\n\nFor Region $4$:\n$$ SMR_4 = \\frac{O_4}{E_4} = \\frac{75}{95} \\approx 0.7895 $$\nSince $SMR_4 < 1$, Region $4$ experienced approximately $21.1\\%$ fewer deaths than expected, indicating a significant deficit risk.\n\nFor Region $5$:\n$$ SMR_5 = \\frac{O_5}{E_5} = \\frac{160}{175} \\approx 0.9143 $$\nSince $SMR_5 < 1$, Region $5$ experienced approximately $8.6\\%$ fewer deaths than expected, indicating a deficit risk.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation and Computation of the Pooled SMR**\n\nThe second task is to derive, from first principles, an expression for the pooled SMR across all regions and to compute its value. The \"first principle\" for pooling SMRs is to treat the combined regions as a single, larger population. The SMR for this combined population is the ratio of the total observed deaths across all regions to the total expected deaths across all regions.\n\nLet $O_{total}$ be the sum of observed deaths and $E_{total}$ be the sum of expected deaths over all $G$ regions.\n$$ O_{total} = \\sum_{g=1}^{G} O_g $$\n$$ E_{total} = \\sum_{g=1}^{G} E_g $$\nThe pooled SMR, denoted $SMR_{pooled}$, is then defined as:\n$$ SMR_{pooled} = \\frac{O_{total}}{E_{total}} = \\frac{\\sum_{g=1}^{G} O_g}{\\sum_{g=1}^{G} E_g} $$\nThis formula represents a weighted average of the individual region SMRs, where the weights are the expected number of deaths in each region, $E_g$:\n$$ SMR_{pooled} = \\frac{\\sum_{g=1}^{G} (SMR_g \\cdot E_g)}{\\sum_{g=1}^{G} E_g} $$\nThis derivation from the principle of aggregation is fundamental.\n\nNow, we compute the value using the given data for $G=5$.\nFirst, we calculate the total observed deaths:\n$$ \\sum_{g=1}^{5} O_g = O_1 + O_2 + O_3 + O_4 + O_5 = 145 + 98 + 210 + 75 + 160 = 688 $$\nNext, we calculate the total expected deaths:\n$$ \\sum_{g=1}^{5} E_g = E_1 + E_2 + E_3 + E_4 + E_5 = 130 + 110 + 190 + 95 + 175 = 700 $$\nNow, we can compute the pooled SMR:\n$$ SMR_{pooled} = \\frac{688}{700} $$\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we perform the division and round to four significant figures.\n$$ SMR_{pooled} = \\frac{688}{700} \\approx 0.98285714... $$\nThe first four significant figures are $9$, $8$, $2$, and $8$. The fifth digit is $5$, which requires rounding up the fourth significant digit.\n$$ SMR_{pooled} \\approx 0.9829 $$\nThe pooled SMR is less than $1$, indicating that, overall, the combined five regions have a slightly lower mortality rate (approximately $1.7\\%$ lower) than the national standard, after accounting for age structure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9829}$$", "id": "4589093"}, {"introduction": "After comparing rates, the next step in an ecologic study is often to explore the relationship between an exposure and an outcome across groups.

The average life expectancy is constant at $80$ across all regions, regardless of average income. The ecologic association is exactly zero (null). The problem requires a *positive* association. This criterion is **not satisfied**.\n\n-   **Criterion 2: Null or Negative Individual-Level Association.**\n    The option states: \"No relationship between individual nominal income and life expectancy within any region (flat).\" This is a null association, which is permitted by the problem's \"null or negative\" requirement. This part of the condition would be met.\n\n-   **Additional Flaw:** The option concludes that cost of living is not a confounder because it does not relate to life expectancy. This is a correct interpretation of the provided data, as a confounder must be associated with the outcome. Since the average life expectancy is $80$ in both low-cost and high-cost strata, there is no association between cost of living and life expectancy. Therefore, this dataset does not represent confounding by cost of living, which is the mechanism the problem seeks to illustrate.\n\n-   **Verdict for Option D:** This option fails to provide the required positive ecologic association.
