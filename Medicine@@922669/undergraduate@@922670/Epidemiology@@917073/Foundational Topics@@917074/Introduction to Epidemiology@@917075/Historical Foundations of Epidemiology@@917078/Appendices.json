First, we compute the age-specific mortality rates, $r_i$, for each of the five age groups. Second, we use these rates to calculate the directly standardized mortality rate ($DSMR$).\n\n**Part 1: Compute Age-Specific Mortality Rates ($r_i$)**\n\nThe age-specific mortality rate for group $i$ is defined as $r_i = \\frac{D_i}{N_i}$.\n\nFor age group $1$ ($0$–$4$ years):\n$r_1 = \\frac{D_1}{N_1} = \\frac{1\\,650}{12\\,000} = 0.1375$.\n\nFor age group $2$ ($5$–$14$ years):\n$r_2 = \\frac{D_2}{N_2} = \\frac{300}{20\\,000} = 0.015$.\n\nFor age group $3$ ($15$–$44$ years):\n$r_3 = \\frac{D_3}{N_3} = \\frac{1\\,100}{35\\,000} = \\frac{11}{350}$.\n\nFor age group $4$ ($45$–$64$ years):\n$r_4 = \\frac{D_4}{N_4} = \\frac{900}{15\\,000} = 0.06$.\n\nFor age group $5$ ($\\ge 65$ years):\n$r_5 = \\frac{D_5}{N_5} = \\frac{1\\,050}{8\\,000} = 0.13125$.\n\n**Part 2: Compute the Directly Standardized Mortality Rate ($DSMR$)**\n\nThe $DSMR$ is calculated by determining the total number of expected deaths that would occur if the study population's age-specific mortality rates ($r_i$) were applied to the standard population distribution ($S_i$), and then dividing this total by the size of the standard population ($N_{std}$).\n\nThe total standard population is $N_{std} = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} S_i = 100\\,000$.\n\nThe expected number of deaths ($E_i$) in each age stratum of the standard population is $E_i = r_i \\cdot S_i$.\n\n$E_1 = r_1 \\cdot S_1 = 0.1375 \\cdot 6\\,000 = 825$.\n\n$E_2 = r_2 \\cdot S_2 = 0.015 \\cdot 12\\,000 = 180$.\n\n$E_3 = r_3 \\cdot S_3 = \\frac{11}{350} \\cdot 50\\,000 = \\frac{11 \\cdot 5000}{35} = \\frac{11 \\cdot 1000}{7} = \\frac{11\\,000}{7}$.\n\n$E_4 = r_4 \\cdot S_4 = 0.06 \\cdot 20\\,000 = 1\\,200$.\n\n$E_5 = r_5 \\cdot S_5 = 0.13125 \\cdot 12\\,000 = 1\\,575$.\n\nThe total expected number of deaths is the sum of the expected deaths in each stratum:\n$E_{total} = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} E_i = 825 + 180 + \\frac{11\\,000}{7} + 1\\,200 + 1\\,575$.\n$E_{total} = (825 + 180 + 1\\,200 + 1\\,575) + \\frac{11\\,000}{7} = 3\\,780 + \\frac{11\\,000}{7}$.\nTo combine these terms, we find a common denominator:\n$E_{total} = \\frac{3\\,780 \\cdot 7}{7} + \\frac{11\\,000}{7} = \\frac{26\\,460 + 11\\,000}{7} = \\frac{37\\,460}{7}$.\n\nThe $DSMR$ is the total expected deaths divided by the total standard population:\n$DSMR = \\frac{E_{total}}{N_{std}} = \\frac{37\\,460 / 7}{100\\,000} = \\frac{37\\,460}{700\\,000}$.\n\nThe problem requires the rate to be expressed per $1\\,000$ person-years. Let this be denoted $DSMR_{1000}$.\n$DSMR_{1000} = DSMR \\times 1\\,000 = \\frac{37\\,460}{700\\,000} \\times 1\\,000 = \\frac{37\\,460}{700} = \\frac{374.6}{7}$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$DSMR_{1000} \\approx 53.5142857...$\n\nFinally, we round this result to four significant figures. The first four significant digits are $5$, $3$, $5$, and $1$. The fifth digit is $4$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$DSMR_{1000} \\approx 53.51$.\n\nThe final directly standardized rate is $53.51$ deaths per $1\\,000$ person-years.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{53.51}$$", "id": "4599258"}, {"introduction": "Robert Koch's postulates provided a revolutionary framework for linking specific microbes to specific diseases, yet the realities of infection and disease proved more complex.
