{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A core function of epidemiology is to accurately quantify disease burden. However, different questions require different measures. This practice clarifies the crucial distinction between the cause-specific mortality rate, which assesses a disease's impact on the entire population, and the case fatality risk (CFR), which measures the severity of the disease among those who are ill. Mastering this distinction is fundamental for correctly interpreting public health data and communicating risk [@problem_id:4581956].", "problem": "A city with a closed and approximately stable population of size $500{,}000$ implements active surveillance for a novel infectious disease over a $6$-month period.

Its denominator is the total person-time experienced by the population at risk. Person-time is the sum of the time each individual in the population was at risk of the outcome (in this case, dying from the disease). It is a measure of how quickly members of the population are dying from the disease. The units are $[events]/[person \\cdot time]$, often expressed as deaths per $100,000$ person-years. The formula is:\n$$\n\\text{Cause-Specific Mortality Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Number of deaths from a specific cause}}{\\text{Total person-time of the population}}\n$$\n\nThe **case fatality risk (CFR)**, often imprecisely called the case fatality rate, is a proportion, not a true rate. It quantifies the risk of death among individuals who have already been diagnosed with the disease (i.e., among cases). The denominator is not the entire population, but the subset of the population that consists of confirmed cases. It is a measure of the severity or lethality of the disease. Being a proportion, it is a unitless quantity that ranges from $0$ to $1$, often expressed as a percentage. The formula is:\n$$\n\\text{Case Fatality Risk} = \\frac{\\text{Number of deaths from a specific cause among cases}}{\\text{Total number of cases of the disease}}\n$$\nIn summary, the mortality rate's denominator is the person-time of the entire population, while the CFR's denominator is the count of individuals with the disease.\n\nNext, we compute the two quantities.\n\n**1. Cause-Specific Mortality Rate**\n\nThe problem specifies that the population size can be treated as constant. Therefore, the total person-time at risk for the population is the product of the population size and the duration of the observation period.\n$$\n\\text{Person-Time} = N \\times \\Delta t\n$$\nGiven $N = 500,000$ persons and $\\Delta t = 0.5$ years:\n$$\n\\text{Person-Time} = 500,000 \\text{ persons} \\times 0.5 \\text{ years} = 250,000 \\text{ person-years}\n$$\nThe number of deaths from the disease is $D = 150$. The cause-specific mortality rate ($M$) is:\n$$\nM = \\frac{D}{\\text{Person-Time}} = \\frac{150 \\text{ deaths}}{250,000 \\text{ person-years}} = 0.0006 \\text{ deaths per person-year}\n$$\nThe problem requires the rate to be expressed per $100,000$ person-years. To do this, we multiply the calculated rate by $100,000$.\n$$\nM_{\\text{per 100k}} = \\left( \\frac{150}{250,000} \\right) \\times 100,000 = \\frac{150 \\times 100,000}{250,000} = \\frac{15,000,000}{250,000} = 60\n$$\nThe rate is $60$ deaths per $100,000$ person-years. Rounding to three significant figures gives $60.0$.\n\n**2. Case Fatality Risk (CFR)**\n\nThe CFR is the ratio of the number of deaths among cases to the total number of cases.\nThe number of deaths is $D = 150$.\nThe number of cases is $I = 2000$.\n$$\n\\text{CFR} = \\frac{D}{I} = \\frac{150}{2000} = \\frac{15}{200} = \\frac{3}{40} = 0.075\n$$\nThis is a unitless decimal, as required. To express this to three significant figures, we write it as $0.0750$.\n\nThe two requested results, in order, are the mortality rate per $100,000$ person-years and the case fatality risk.\nMortality Rate: $60.0$\nCase Fatality Risk: $0.0750$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n60.0 & 0.0750\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4581956"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply counting cases, epidemiologists seek to understand the associations between exposures and outcomes. This exercise introduces the three primary measures used to quantify these associations: the risk ratio ($RR$), the risk difference ($RD$), and the odds ratio ($OR$).

Then, state the causal interpretation of each measure under exchangeability in terms of the cohort’s potential outcomes.", "solution": "The following values are given for a prospective cohort study with a fixed follow-up period:\nThe cumulative incidence, or risk, of the outcome in the exposed group is $p_1 = 0.15$.\nThe cumulative incidence, or risk, of the outcome in the unexposed group is $p_0 = 0.05$.\nThe problem states that the exposed and unexposed groups are exchangeable, which is a key assumption for causal inference.\n\nFirst, we will compute the three requested comparative measures: the risk ratio ($RR$), the risk difference ($RD$), and the odds ratio ($OR$). It is convenient to express the given probabilities in fractional form:\n$p_1 = 0.15 = \\frac{15}{100} = \\frac{3}{20}$\n$p_0 = 0.05 = \\frac{5}{100} = \\frac{1}{20}$\n\n1.  **Risk Ratio (RR)**\n    The risk ratio is defined as the ratio of the risk in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group.\n    $$RR = \\frac{p_1}{p_0}$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$RR = \\frac{0.15}{0.05} = \\frac{3/20}{1/20} = 3$$\n\n2.  **Risk Difference (RD)**\n    The risk difference is defined as the difference in risk between the exposed and unexposed groups.\n    $$RD = p_1 - p_0$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$RD = 0.15 - 0.05 = 0.10 = \\frac{1}{10}$$\n\n3.  **Odds Ratio (OR)**\n    The odds ratio is the ratio of the odds of the outcome in the exposed group to the odds of the outcome in the unexposed group. The odds of an event with probability $p$ is given by $\\frac{p}{1-p}$.\n    Let $O_1$ be the odds in the exposed group and $O_0$ be the odds in the unexposed group.\n    $$O_1 = \\frac{p_1}{1-p_1} = \\frac{0.15}{1-0.15} = \\frac{0.15}{0.85} = \\frac{15}{85} = \\frac{3}{17}$$\n    $$O_0 = \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0} = \\frac{0.05}{1-0.05} = \\frac{0.05}{0.95} = \\frac{5}{95} = \\frac{1}{19}$$\n    The odds ratio is then:\n    $$OR = \\frac{O_1}{O_0} = \\frac{3/17}{1/19} = \\frac{3}{17} \\times \\frac{19}{1} = \\frac{57}{17}$$\n    The fraction $\\frac{57}{17}$ is in its simplest form as $17$ is a prime number and not a factor of $57$.\n\nNext, we state the causal interpretation of each measure. The assumption of exchangeability is crucial. In the potential outcomes framework, let $Y^1$ be the outcome if an individual were exposed and $Y^0$ be the outcome if they were unexposed. Exchangeability implies that the risk of the outcome under a specific exposure level is the same regardless of the exposure group an individual actually belongs to. That is, $P(Y^0=1 | E=1) = P(Y^0=1 | E=0) = P(Y^0=1)$, where $E$ denotes exposure status. This allows us to interpret the observed risk in the unexposed, $p_0$, as the counterfactual risk in the exposed had they not been exposed. Thus, $p_1$ represents the risk if everyone in the population were exposed, and $p_0$ represents the risk if everyone were unexposed.\n\n-   **Causal Interpretation of Risk Ratio (RR)**: The calculated $RR = 3$ means that, for the population studied, being exposed multiplies the risk of the outcome by a factor of $3$ compared to what the risk would have been in the absence of exposure. In other words, the exposure causes a $3$-fold increase in the risk of the outcome.\n\n-   **Causal Interpretation of Risk Difference (RD)**: The calculated $RD = \\frac{1}{10}$ or $0.10$ represents the absolute increase in risk caused by the exposure. It means that the exposure leads to $10$ additional cases of the outcome for every $100$ individuals exposed over the study's time horizon, compared to the number of cases that would have occurred if those same individuals had not been exposed. This is often referred to as the average causal effect on the additive scale.\n\n-   **Causal Interpretation of Odds Ratio (OR)**: The calculated $OR = \\frac{57}{17} \\approx 3.35$ means that the odds of developing the outcome are approximately $3.35$ times higher if the population were exposed compared to what the odds would have been if the population were unexposed. While the odds ratio is a valid measure of association and has important mathematical properties (e.g., its invariance in case-control studies), its direct causal interpretation in terms of \"odds\" is generally less intuitive for public health communication than the risk-based measures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & \\frac{1}{10} & \\frac{57}{17} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4582002"}, {"introduction": "Observing an association is not the same as proving causation, as a \"third variable\" can often distort the true relationship.

Round your answer to four significant figures. Express the final value as a pure decimal number with no units.", "solution": "**1. Conceptual Explanation of Simpson’s Paradox via Confounding**\n\nThe phenomenon of Simpson's paradox arises in this context due to confounding by age. According to the provided definition, a variable is a confounder if it is associated with both the exposure (the preventive intervention) and the outcome, and is not on the causal pathway from exposure to outcome. We can verify that age meets these criteria with the given data.\n\n- **Association of Age with Exposure**: The problem states the intervention is more common in the older group. The proportion of exposed individuals in the younger stratum is $\\frac{100}{100+900} = \\frac{100}{1000} = 0.1$. The proportion of exposed individuals in the older stratum is $\\frac{900}{900+100} = \\frac{900}{1000} = 0.9$. There is a strong association between age and exposure status.\n\n- **Association of Age with Outcome**: The problem states outcome risk is strongly age-dependent. The overall risk in the younger stratum is $\\frac{1+18}{100+900} = \\frac{19}{1000} = 0.019$. The overall risk in the older stratum is $\\frac{90+20}{900+100} = \\frac{110}{1000} = 0.11$. Older individuals have a substantially higher baseline risk of the outcome, regardless of the intervention.\n\n- **Not on Causal Pathway**: It is implicit that the intervention does not cause a change in age, so age is not on the causal pathway.\n\nConfounding occurs because the crude (unadjusted) analysis mixes these disparate groups. The crude exposed group is predominantly composed of older individuals ($900$ out of $1000$, or $90\\%$), who have a high baseline risk. The crude unexposed group is predominantly composed of younger individuals ($900$ out of $1000$, or $90\\%$), who have a low baseline risk.\n\nConsequently, the crude comparison of risks is not a fair comparison of the intervention's effect. It is largely a comparison between high-risk older people (most of whom are exposed) and low-risk younger people (most of whom are unexposed). This imbalance creates a spurious association. The protective effect of the intervention within each age group is masked. The confounding by age is so severe that it not only biases the result but inverts its direction, making a protective intervention appear harmful. This reversal of association is Simpson's paradox. Stratified analysis, which compares exposed and unexposed individuals within the same age group, controls for this confounding and reveals the true, underlying association.\n\n**2. Crude Risk and Crude Relative Risk**\n\nFirst, we combine the data from both strata to get the crude totals.\n- Total number of exposed individuals: $N_{Exp,crude} = 100 \\text{ (young)} + 900 \\text{ (old)} = 1000$.\n- Number of outcomes among exposed: $O_{Exp,crude} = 1 \\text{ (young)} + 90 \\text{ (old)} = 91$.\n- Total number of unexposed individuals: $N_{Unexp,crude} = 900 \\text{ (young)} + 100 \\text{ (old)} = 1000$.\n- Number of outcomes among unexposed: $O_{Unexp,crude} = 18 \\text{ (young)} + 20 \\text{ (old)} = 38$.\n\nUsing the definition of risk, we compute the crude risks:\n- Crude risk among exposed: $R_{Exp,crude} = \\frac{O_{Exp,crude}}{N_{Exp,crude}} = \\frac{91}{1000} = 0.091$.\n- Crude risk among unexposed: $R_{Unexp,crude} = \\frac{O_{Unexp,crude}}{N_{Unexp,crude}} = \\frac{38}{1000} = 0.038$.\n\nUsing the definition of relative risk, we compute the crude relative risk:\n- Crude Relative Risk: $RR_{crude} = \\frac{R_{Exp,crude}}{R_{Unexp,crude}} = \\frac{0.091}{0.038} = \\frac{91}{38} \\approx 2.3947$.\n\nThe crude relative risk of approximately $2.39$ suggests that the intervention is associated with more than a twofold *increase* in risk, which is the paradox.\n\n**3. Stratum-Specific Relative Risks**\n\nWe now calculate the risks and relative risk within each age stratum. Let subscripts $y$ denote the younger stratum and $o$ denote the older stratum.\n\n- **Younger Stratum:**\n  - Risk among exposed: $R_{Exp,y} = \\frac{1}{100} = 0.01$.\n  - Risk among unexposed: $R_{Unexp,y} = \\frac{18}{900} = 0.02$.\n  - Stratum-specific Relative Risk: $RR_y = \\frac{R_{Exp,y}}{R_{Unexp,y}} = \\frac{0.01}{0.02} = 0.5$.\n\n- **Older Stratum:**\n  - Risk among exposed: $R_{Exp,o} = \\frac{90}{900} = 0.1$.\n  - Risk among unexposed: $R_{Unexp,o} = \\frac{20}{100} = 0.2$.\n  - Stratum-specific Relative Risk: $RR_o = \\frac{R_{Exp,o}}{R_{Unexp,o}} = \\frac{0.1}{0.2} = 0.5$.\n\nWithin both the younger and older strata, the relative risk is consistently $0.5$, indicating that the intervention cuts the risk of the outcome by half. This protective effect is the opposite of the harmful effect suggested by the crude analysis.\n\n**4. Mantel-Haenszel Age-Adjusted Pooled Relative Risk**\n\nTo obtain a single,summary estimate of the effect that is adjusted for the confounding by age, we use a stratum-weighted approach. The Mantel-Haenszel (MH) estimator is a standard and principled method for this. The MH estimator for a pooled relative risk, $\\widehat{RR}_{MH}$, does not simply average the stratum-specific RRs. Instead, it pools the data by constructing a weighted sum of numerators and denominators.\n\nLet $i$ be the index for a stratum. For each stratum $i$, the data are:\n- $a_i$: outcomes among exposed\n- $b_i$: outcomes among unexposed\n- $N_{1i}$: total number of exposed\n- $N_{0i}$: total number of unexposed\n- $T_i = N_{1i} + N_{0i}$: total in stratum $i$\n\nThe MH estimator is defined as:\n$$ \\widehat{RR}_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{i} a_i \\frac{N_{0i}}{T_i}}{\\sum_{i} b_i \\frac{N_{1i}}{T_i}} $$\nThe logic of this weighting scheme is to give more weight to strata that are more informative. The term $b_i N_{1i} / T_i$ in the denominator for stratum $i$ can be seen as a measure of the amount of information the stratum contributes to the comparison. The weighting is precise and has been shown to yield a consistent estimator of a common relative risk across strata. The estimator essentially compares the sum of observed exposed cases (weighted) to the sum of observed unexposed cases (with a different weighting). This specific cross-weighting scheme ($a_i$ weighted by a factor of the unexposed group, $b_i$ by a factor of the exposed group) ensures that the pooled estimate is not distorted by strata with very unbalanced distributions of exposure, which is the source of the confounding.\n\nWe apply this formula to the given data.\n\n- For the younger stratum ($i=y$):\n  - $a_y = 1$, $b_y = 18$, $N_{1y} = 100$, $N_{0y} = 900$, $T_y = 1000$.\n- For the older stratum ($i=o$):\n  - $a_o = 90$, $b_o = 20$, $N_{1o} = 900$, $N_{0o} = 100$, $T_o = 1000$.\n\nCalculate the numerator of the MH estimator:\n$$ \\sum_i a_i \\frac{N_{0i}}{T_i} = a_y \\frac{N_{0y}}{T_y} + a_o \\frac{N_{0o}}{T_o} = (1) \\left(\\frac{900}{1000}\\right) + (90) \\left(\\frac{100}{1000}\\right) $$\n$$ = 1 \\times 0.9 + 90 \\times 0.1 = 0.9 + 9.0 = 9.9 $$\n\nCalculate the denominator of the MH estimator:\n$$ \\sum_i b_i \\frac{N_{1i}}{T_i} = b_y \\frac{N_{1y}}{T_y} + b_o \\frac{N_{1o}}{T_o} = (18) \\left(\\frac{100}{1000}\\right) + (20) \\left(\\frac{900}{1000}\\right) $$\n$$ = 18 \\times 0.1 + 20 \\times 0.9 = 1.8 + 18.0 = 19.8 $$\n\nFinally, compute the MH pooled relative risk:\n$$ \\widehat{RR}_{MH} = \\frac{9.9}{19.8} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 $$\nThe age-adjusted pooled relative risk is $0.5$. Rounding to four significant figures, the final answer is $0.5000$. This adjusted estimate accurately reflects the protective effect of the intervention, consistent with the stratum-specific findings.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5000}\n$$", "id": "4582030"}]}
