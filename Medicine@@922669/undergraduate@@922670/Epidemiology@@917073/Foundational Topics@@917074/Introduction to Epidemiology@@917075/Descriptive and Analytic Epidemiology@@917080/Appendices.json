It is scientifically grounded in the fundamental principles of epidemiology, well-posed with all necessary data and clear definitions provided, and objective in its language. The scenario is a standard textbook case for calculating basic measures of disease frequency in an outbreak setting.\n\nThe core task is to calculate two epidemiological measures: the attack rate and the secondary attack rate. Both are specific instances of the incidence proportion, also known as risk. The fundamental definition of incidence proportion ($IP$) is the ratio of the number of new cases of a disease ($C$) that develop over a specified period of time to the number of individuals in the population at risk ($N$) at the beginning of that period.\n\n$$\nIP = \\frac{C}{N}\n$$\n\nThe problem defines the attack rate ($AR$) as the incidence proportion in a narrowly defined exposure setting, and the secondary attack rate ($SAR$) as the incidence proportion among susceptible contacts of primary cases.\n\nFirst, we will calculate the attack rate for the school cohort.\nThe problem provides the following data for the school outbreak:\n- The total number of students in the well-defined cohort exposed to the suspect meal is $150$. This represents the population at risk, so the denominator is $N_{\\text{school}} = 150$.\n- The number of students who developed the illness is $30$. This represents the number of new cases in the cohort, so the numerator is $C_{\\text{school}} = 30$.\n\nUsing the definition of attack rate as an incidence proportion, we have:\n$$\nAR_{\\text{school}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{school}}}{N_{\\text{school}}} = \\frac{30}{150}\n$$\nCalculating this value:\n$$\nAR_{\\text{school}} = 0.2\n$$\n\nNext, we will calculate the secondary attack rate for the household contacts.\nThe problem provides the following data for the household transmission:\n- The number of primary cases is $4$. These individuals are the source of infection for the contacts and are not considered at risk for becoming secondary cases.\n- The number of susceptible household contacts who were disease-free at the start is $20$. This is the population at risk for secondary infection. Therefore, the denominator is $N_{\\text{contacts}} = 20$.\n- The number of these contacts who subsequently developed the illness is $6$. This represents the number of new (secondary) cases, so the numerator is $C_{\\text{contacts}} = 6$.\n\nUsing the definition of secondary attack rate as the incidence proportion among susceptible contacts, we have:\n$$\nSAR_{\\text{household}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{contacts}}}{N_{\\text{contacts}}} = \\frac{6}{20}\n$$\nIt is crucial to note that the denominator for the secondary attack rate is the number of susceptible contacts, which is explicitly given as $20$. The $4$ primary cases are excluded from this denominator.\nCalculating this value:\n$$\nSAR_{\\text{household}} = 0.3\n$$\n\nThe final step is to format the answers as decimal fractions rounded to four significant figures.\n- For the school attack rate, $0.2$ becomes $0.2000$.\n- For the household secondary attack rate, $0.3$ becomes $0.3000$.\n\nThe requested final answer is the pair of these two values, in the specified order: school attack rate, then household secondary attack rate.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.2000 & 0.3000 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4585374"}, {"introduction": "Moving from describing a health event to analyzing its potential causes is the core of analytic epidemiology.

The problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of epidemiology, is well-posed with sufficient data for the calculation, and is stated objectively. The problem is valid and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nTo formalize the analysis, we arrange the given data into a standard $2 \\times 2$ contingency table. Let the rows represent exposure status (Exposed/Unexposed) and the columns represent disease status (Cases/Controls). We assign the standard variables $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ to the cells of the table.\n\n- $a$ = number of exposed cases = $120$\n- $b$ = number of exposed controls = $90$\n- $c$ = number of unexposed cases = $80$\n- $d$ = number of unexposed controls = $110$\n\nThe contingency table is as follows:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc|c}\n& \\text{Cases (Disease)} & \\text{Controls (No Disease)} & \\text{Total} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Exposed} & a = 120 & b = 90 & 210 \\\\\n\\text{Unexposed} & c = 80 & d = 110 & 190 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Total} & 200 & 200 & 400\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Odds Ratio (OR)**\n\nIn a case-control study, the odds ratio is computed by comparing the odds of exposure among cases to the odds of exposure among controls.\n\nThe odds of prior exposure among the cases is the ratio of exposed cases to unexposed cases:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{cases}} = \\frac{a}{c} = \\frac{120}{80} = \\frac{3}{2} $$\n\nThe odds of prior exposure among the controls is the ratio of exposed controls to unexposed controls:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{controls}} = \\frac{b}{d} = \\frac{90}{110} = \\frac{9}{11} $$\n\nThe odds ratio ($OR$) is the ratio of these two odds, also known as the cross-product ratio:\n$$ OR = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{cases}}}{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{controls}}} = \\frac{a/c}{b/d} = \\frac{ad}{bc} $$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values into the formula:\n$$ OR = \\frac{120 \\times 110}{90 \\times 80} $$\nTo find the exact fraction, we simplify the expression by canceling common factors:\n$$ OR = \\frac{120 \\times 110}{90 \\times 80} = \\frac{12 \\times 10 \\times 11 \\times 10}{9 \\times 10 \\times 8 \\times 10} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{9 \\times 8} $$\n$$ OR = \\frac{(3 \\times 4) \\times 11}{(3 \\times 3) \\times (2 \\times 4)} = \\frac{11}{3 \\times 2} = \\frac{11}{6} $$\nThe odds ratio is $\\frac{11}{6}$.\n\n**Part 2: The Rare Disease Assumption**\n\nThe odds ratio calculated from a case-control study approximates the risk ratio ($RR$), also known as the relative risk, under a specific condition known as the \"rare disease assumption\". To understand this, we must first define the risk ratio and the odds ratio in the context of the entire source population.\n\nThe risk ratio ($RR$) is the ratio of the incidence of disease in the exposed population ($R_e$) to the incidence of disease in the unexposed population ($R_u$).\n$$ RR = \\frac{R_e}{R_u} $$\nThe population odds ratio ($OR_{pop}$) is the ratio of the odds of disease in the exposed population to the odds of disease in the unexposed population. The odds of an event is the probability of the event occurring divided by the probability of it not occurring, $p/(1-p)$. So, the odds of disease in the exposed is $R_e/(1 - R_e)$ and in the unexposed is $R_u/(1 - R_u)$.\n$$ OR_{pop} = \\frac{R_e / (1-R_e)}{R_u / (1-R_u)} $$\nWe can rearrange this expression to show its relationship with the risk ratio:\n$$ OR_{pop} = \\left(\\frac{R_e}{R_u}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1-R_u}{1-R_e}\\right) = RR \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1-R_u}{1-R_e}\\right) $$\nThis equation is the formal link between the odds ratio and the risk ratio.\n\nThe rare disease assumption states that the incidence of the disease is low in both the exposed and unexposed groups. If the disease is rare, then $R_e$ and $R_u$ are both very small numbers (i.e., $R_e \\ll 1$ and $R_u \\ll 1$).\nConsequently:\n- The term $1-R_e$ is approximately equal to $1$.\n- The term $1-R_u$ is also approximately equal to $1$.\n\nUnder this assumption, the correction factor $\\left(\\frac{1-R_u}{1-R_e}\\right)$ approaches $1$:\n$$ \\frac{1-R_u}{1-R_e} \\approx \\frac{1}{1} = 1 $$\nTherefore, when the disease is rare, the population odds ratio becomes a good approximation of the risk ratio:\n$$ OR_{pop} \\approx RR \\cdot 1 = RR $$\nA case-control study, if well-designed, yields an odds ratio ($OR = ad/bc$) that is an unbiased estimate of the population odds ratio ($OR_{pop}$). Thus, under the rare disease assumption, the odds ratio calculated from a case-control study serves as a valid approximation of the risk ratio in the source population.\n\nThe conditions under which this approximation is valid are:\n1.  **The disease is rare**: The cumulative incidence of the disease in the source population should be low. As a general guideline, an incidence of less than $10\\%$ is often considered sufficiently rare for the approximation to be reasonable. The smaller the incidence, the closer the $OR$ is to the $RR$.\n2.  **Cases are representative**: The cases selected for the study must be representative of all cases in the source population with respect to their exposure status.\n3.  **Controls are representative**: The controls must be sampled from the same source population that produced the cases, and their selection must be independent of exposure status. This means that a control is an individual who, if they had developed the disease, would have been included as a case in the study.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{11}{6}} $$", "id": "4585355"}, {"introduction": "A critical challenge in analytic epidemiology is to ensure that an observed association between an exposure and a disease is not distorted by a third variable, known as a confounder.
