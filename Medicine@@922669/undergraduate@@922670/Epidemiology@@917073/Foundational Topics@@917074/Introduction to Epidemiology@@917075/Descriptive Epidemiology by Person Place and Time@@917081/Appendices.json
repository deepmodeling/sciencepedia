Investigators collected counts of newly diagnosed cases and mid-year population sizes for three age strata at two time points, $2005$ and $2025$.

The core of the analysis is to compare the crude secular trend with the age-adjusted trend to understand the impact of a changing population age structure, a phenomenon known as confounding. We will proceed by rigorously applying the definitions of crude and age-adjusted incidence rates.\n\nLet $i$ be the index for the age stratum, where $i=1$ for ages $0$–$39$, $i=2$ for ages $40$–$64$, and $i=3$ for ages $\\geq 65$. Let $y$ denote the year, either $2005$ or $2025$.\nLet $C_{i,y}$ be the number of incident cases in stratum $i$ and year $y$.\nLet $N_{i,y}$ be the mid-year population in stratum $i$ and year $y$.\nThe provided data is as follows:\nFor year $y=2005$:\n$C_{1,2005} = 300$, $N_{1,2005} = 600,000$\n$C_{2,2005} = 600$, $N_{2,2005} = 300,000$\n$C_{3,2005} = 800$, $N_{3,2005} = 100,000$\n\nFor year $y=2025$:\n$C_{1,2025} = 160$, $N_{1,2025} = 400,000$\n$C_{2,2025} = 560$, $N_{2,2025} = 350,000$\n$C_{3,2025} = 1,600$, $N_{3,2025} = 250,000$\n\nAll rates are to be expressed per $100,000$ person-years.\n\n### 1. Crude Incidence Rates\n\nThe crude incidence rate ($CIR$) for a specific year is the total number of new cases divided by the total mid-year population, multiplied by $100,000$.\n$$CIR_y = \\frac{\\sum_{i} C_{i,y}}{\\sum_{i} N_{i,y}} \\times 100,000$$\n\nFor year $2005$:\nTotal cases: $C_{2005} = \\sum_{i} C_{i,2005} = 300 + 600 + 800 = 1,700$.\nTotal population: $N_{2005} = \\sum_{i} N_{i,2005} = 600,000 + 300,000 + 100,000 = 1,000,000$.\nThe crude incidence rate for $2005$ is:\n$$CIR_{2005} = \\frac{1,700}{1,000,000} \\times 100,000 = 170 \\text{ per } 100,000 \\text{ person-years}$$\n\nFor year $2025$:\nTotal cases: $C_{2025} = \\sum_{i} C_{i,2025} = 160 + 560 + 1,600 = 2,320$.\nTotal population: $N_{2025} = \\sum_{i} N_{i,2025} = 400,000 + 350,000 + 250,000 = 1,000,000$.\nThe crude incidence rate for $2025$ is:\n$$CIR_{2025} = \\frac{2,320}{1,000,000} \\times 100,000 = 232 \\text{ per } 100,000 \\text{ person-years}$$\nBased on crude rates, the incidence appears to have increased from $170$ to $232$ per $100,000$ between $2005$ and $2025$.\n\n### 2. Age-Adjusted Incidence Rates\n\nTo account for the change in the age distribution of the population, we use direct standardization. This involves calculating what the crude rate would have been in each year if the populations had a \"standard\" age structure.\n\nFirst, we define the standard population as the sum of the populations from both years for each age stratum. Let $N_{i,std}$ be the standard population for stratum $i$.\n$$N_{1,std} = N_{1,2005} + N_{1,2025} = 600,000 + 400,000 = 1,000,000$$\n$$N_{2,std} = N_{2,2005} + N_{2,2025} = 300,000 + 350,000 = 650,000$$\n$$N_{3,std} = N_{3,2005} + N_{3,2025} = 100,000 + 250,000 = 350,000$$\nThe total standard population is $N_{std} = \\sum_{i} N_{i,std} = 1,000,000 + 650,000 + 350,000 = 2,000,000$.\n\nNext, we compute the age-specific incidence rates ($ASIR$) for each stratum and year.\n$$ASIR_{i,y} = \\frac{C_{i,y}}{N_{i,y}}$$\nFor year $2005$:\n$ASIR_{1,2005} = \\frac{300}{600,000} = 0.0005$\n$ASIR_{2,2005} = \\frac{600}{300,000} = 0.0020$\n$ASIR_{3,2005} = \\frac{800}{100,000} = 0.0080$\n\nFor year $2025$:\n$ASIR_{1,2025} = \\frac{160}{400,000} = 0.0004$\n$ASIR_{2,2025} = \\frac{560}{350,000} = 0.0016$\n$ASIR_{3,2025} = \\frac{1,600}{250,000} = 0.0064$\n\nThe age-adjusted incidence rate ($AAIR$) is the sum of the expected number of cases in each stratum of the standard population, divided by the total standard population, and multiplied by $100,000$. The expected cases for a given year $y$ are calculated by applying its $ASIRs$ to the standard population strata.\n$$AAIR_y = \\frac{\\sum_{i} (ASIR_{i,y} \\times N_{i,std})}{\\sum_{i} N_{i,std}} \\times 100,000$$\n\nFor year $2005$:\nExpected cases $E_{2005} = (0.0005 \\times 1,000,000) + (0.0020 \\times 650,000) + (0.0080 \\times 350,000)$\n$E_{2005} = 500 + 1,300 + 2,800 = 4,600$\n$$AAIR_{2005} = \\frac{4,600}{2,000,000} \\times 100,000 = 230 \\text{ per } 100,000 \\text{ person-years}$$\n\nFor year $2025$:\nExpected cases $E_{2025} = (0.0004 \\times 1,000,000) + (0.0016 \\times 650,000) + (0.0064 \\times 350,000)$\n$E_{2025} = 400 + 1,040 + 2,240 = 3,680$\n$$AAIR_{2025} = \\frac{3,680}{2,000,000} \\times 100,000 = 184 \\text{ per } 100,000 \\text{ person-years}$$\n\nAfter adjusting for age, the incidence rate has actually decreased from $230$ to $184$ per $100,000$. The initial crude rate increase was misleading because the population of City Delta aged significantly between 2005 and 2025. The proportion of the population in the highest-risk age group ($\\geq 65$) increased from $10\\%$ ($100,000/1,000,000$) to $25\\%$ ($250,000/1,000,000$). Since incidence increases with age, this demographic shift inflated the crude rate for $2025$, masking a true decline in age-specific risk.\n\n### 3. Age-Adjusted Incidence Rate Ratio\n\nThe age-adjusted incidence rate ratio ($IRR_{\\text{adj}}$) compares the age-adjusted rates of $2025$ to $2005$.\n$$IRR_{\\text{adj}} = \\frac{AAIR_{2025}}{AAIR_{2005}}$$\nUsing the calculated values:\n$$IRR_{\\text{adj}} = \\frac{184}{230}$$\nThe calculation simplifies to:\n$$IRR_{\\text{adj}} = \\frac{ \\frac{E_{2025}}{N_{std}} \\times 100,000 }{ \\frac{E_{2005}}{N_{std}} \\times 100,000 } = \\frac{E_{2025}}{E_{2005}} = \\frac{3,680}{4,600} = \\frac{368}{460} = \\frac{184}{230} = \\frac{92}{115} = 0.8$$\nThe result is exactly $0.8$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. This gives $0.8000$.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the ratio of the age-specific rates ($ASIR_{i,2025} / ASIR_{i,2005}$) is constant across all age strata:\n$0.0004/0.0005 = 0.8$\n$0.0016/0.0020 = 0.8$\n$0.0064/0.0080 = 0.8$\nWhen this condition of a constant rate ratio holds (no effect modification by age), the directly adjusted rate ratio will be equal to this common stratum-specific rate ratio, which is $0.8$.\nThe final answer is the decimal value of this ratio, expressed to four significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8000}$$", "id": "4585765"}, {"introduction": "Just as population structures can change over time, they often differ significantly between places.

Discussion on the Standard Population\n\nThe choice of a standard population is essential for making fair comparisons. By applying both cities' age-specific rates to the same age structure, we remove the confounding effect of age. The resulting standardized rates answer the question: \"What would the mortality rate in each city be if they had the same age distribution?\" Using a stable, external standard (like a national or world standard) is particularly useful for comparing multiple locations or tracking trends over time, as it provides a consistent, neutral benchmark for all comparisons. The SRR of $1.271$ indicates that after accounting for age differences, the mortality risk in Ridgefield is about $27\\%$ higher than in Harborview.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.271}\n$$", "id": "4585753"}, {"introduction": "We now shift from analyzing long-term trends to the urgent task of monitoring an active disease outbreak.

We calculate the report date for every case in the line list:\n- Onset $1$, delays $\\{2, 1\\}$ $\\rightarrow$ Report dates $\\{3, 2\\}$\n- Onset $2$, delays $\\{0, 1, 3\\}$ $\\rightarrow$ Report dates $\\{2, 3, 5\\}$\n- Onset $3$, delays $\\{1, 0, 1, 2\\}$ $\\rightarrow$ Report dates $\\{4, 3, 4, 5\\}$\n- Onset $4$, delays $\\{1, 2, 0, 1, 3\\}$ $\\rightarrow$ Report dates $\\{5, 6, 4, 5, 7\\}$\n- Onset $5$, delays $\\{1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 3\\}$ $\\rightarrow$ Report dates $\\{6, 5, 6, 7, 6, 8\\}$\n- Onset $6$, delays $\\{2, 1, 0, 1, 2\\}$ $\\rightarrow$ Report dates $\\{8, 7, 6, 7, 8\\}$\n- Onset $7$, delays $\\{1, 2, 2, 0\\}$ $\\rightarrow$ Report dates $\\{8, 9, 9, 7\\}$\n- Onset $8$, delays $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$ $\\rightarrow$ Report dates $\\{8, 9, 10\\}$\n- Onset $9$, delays $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ $\\rightarrow$ Report dates $\\{10, 11, 12\\}$\n- Onset $10$, delays $\\{1, 2\\}$ $\\rightarrow$ Report dates $\\{11, 12\\}$\n\nWe tally the number of cases for each report date $T_R$:\n- $N_{\\text{report}}(1) = 0$\n- $N_{\\text{report}}(2) = 2$\n- $N_{\\text{report}}(3) = 3$\n- $N_{\\text{report}}(4) = 3$\n- $N_{\\text{report}}(5) = 5$\n- $N_{\\text{report}}(6) = 5$\n- $N_{\\text{report}}(7) = 5$\n- $N_{\\text{report}}(8) = 5$\n- $N_{\\text{report}}(9) = 3$\n- $N_{\\text{report}}(10) = 2$\n- $N_{\\text{report}}(11) = 2$\n- $N_{\\text{report}}(12) = 2$\nThe epidemic curve by report date has a peak daily incidence of $5$ cases, which occurs on days $5, 6, 7,$ and $8$.\n$$ \\text{Peak}_{\\text{report}} = 5 $$\n\nThird, we compute the required ratio of the peak of the adjusted onset curve to the peak of the report date curve.\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Peak}_{\\text{adj,onset}}}{\\text{Peak}_{\\text{report}}} = \\frac{6}{5} = 1.2 $$\nThe result is 1.2. As the problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, the final answer is 1.200.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.200}$$", "id": "4585658"}]}
