This practice builds essential skills in adjusting for confounding at the population level.", "problem": "A cohort study aims to compare all-cause mortality in a study population to a reference population using indirect age standardization. Age is the person attribute of interest. The Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) is defined conceptually as the comparison of the observed deaths in the study population to the deaths that would be expected if the study population experienced the reference population’s age-specific mortality rates. Expected deaths under indirect age standardization are obtained by applying the reference age-specific mortality rates to the study population’s age-specific person-time and summing over strata.\n\nYou are given three age strata and the following data:\n- Ages $18$–$39$: study person-time $10{,}000$ person-years; reference mortality rate $2$ per $1{,}000$ person-years; observed deaths in the study population $25$.\n- Ages $40$–$64$: study person-time $5{,}000$ person-years; reference mortality rate $8$ per $1{,}000$ person-years; observed deaths in the study population $50$.\n- Ages $\\geq 65$: study person-time $2{,}000$ person-years; reference mortality rate $30$ per $1{,}000$ person-years; observed deaths in the study population $75$.\n\nUsing only the foundational definitions that:\n1. age-specific expected deaths in stratum $i$ equal the reference age-specific mortality rate in that stratum multiplied by the study age-specific person-time in that stratum (with correct unit conversion), and\n2. indirectly standardized total expected deaths equal the sum of age-specific expected deaths across strata,\n\ncompute the indirectly standardized SMR for this study population and express it as a decimal.

No rounding is required, and the SMR is unitless; express the SMR as a decimal number.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) using the method of indirect age standardization. The SMR is defined as the ratio of the total observed deaths in the study population to the total expected deaths.\n\nLet $O$ be the total observed deaths and $E$ be the total expected deaths. The SMR is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\text{SMR} = \\frac{O}{E}\n$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of observed deaths, $O$, by summing the observed deaths from each of the three age strata. Let the strata be indexed by $i=1, 2, 3$.\nThe observed deaths in each stratum are given as:\n- Stratum $1$ (ages $18$–$39$): $O_1 = 25$\n- Stratum $2$ (ages $40$–$64$): $O_2 = 50$\n- Stratum $3$ (ages $\\geq 65$): $O_3 = 75$\n\nThe total number of observed deaths is the sum of these values:\n$$\nO = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} O_i = 25 + 50 + 75 = 150\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of expected deaths, $E$. The problem defines the expected deaths for a given age stratum $i$, denoted $E_i$, as the product of the reference population's age-specific mortality rate, $M_i^{\\text{ref}}$, and the study population's age-specific person-time, $PT_i^{\\text{study}}$.\n$$\nE_i = M_i^{\\text{ref}} \\times PT_i^{\\text{study}}\n$$\nWe must perform this calculation for each stratum and then sum the results. It is critical to ensure the units of the mortality rates are consistent. The rates are given \"per $1{,}000$ person-years\", which must be converted to a rate per person-year.\n\nFor stratum $1$ (ages $18$–$39$):\nThe study person-time is $PT_1^{\\text{study}} = 10{,}000$ person-years.\nThe reference mortality rate is $M_1^{\\text{ref}} = 2$ per $1{,}000$ person-years, which is equivalent to $\\frac{2}{1{,}000} = 0.002$ deaths per person-year.\nThe expected deaths for this stratum are:\n$$\nE_1 = 0.002 \\, \\text{person-years}^{-1} \\times 10{,}000 \\, \\text{person-years} = 20\n$$\n\nFor stratum $2$ (ages $40$–$64$):\nThe study person-time is $PT_2^{\\text{study}} = 5{,}000$ person-years.\nThe reference mortality rate is $M_2^{\\text{ref}} = 8$ per $1{,}000$ person-years, which is equivalent to $\\frac{8}{1{,}000} = 0.008$ deaths per person-year.\nThe expected deaths for this stratum are:\n$$\nE_2 = 0.008 \\, \\text{person-years}^{-1} \\times 5{,}000 \\, \\text{person-years} = 40\n$$\n\nFor stratum $3$ (ages $\\geq 65$):\nThe study person-time is $PT_3^{\\text{study}} = 2{,}000$ person-years.\nThe reference mortality rate is $M_3^{\\text{ref}} = 30$ per $1{,}000$ person-years, which is equivalent to $\\frac{30}{1{,}000} = 0.030$ deaths per person-year.\nThe expected deaths for this stratum are:\n$$\nE_3 = 0.030 \\, \\text{person-years}^{-1} \\times 2{,}000 \\, \\text{person-years} = 60\n$$\n\nThe total number of expected deaths, $E$, is the sum of the stratum-specific expected deaths:\n$$\nE = E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120\n$$\n\nNow, we can compute the SMR by dividing the total observed deaths by the total expected deaths:\n$$\n\\text{SMR} = \\frac{O}{E} = \\frac{150}{120} = \\frac{15}{12} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25\n$$\n\nThe problem also asks what the SMR equals under the assumption that the study-to-reference age-specific rate ratio is constant across strata. Let this constant ratio be $C$. For any stratum $i$, this means $M_i^{\\text{study}} / M_i^{\\text{ref}} = C$, where $M_i^{\\text{study}}$ is the mortality rate in the study population.\nThe observed deaths are $O_i = M_i^{\\text{study}} \\times PT_i^{\\text{study}}$. From the assumption, $M_i^{\\text{study}} = C \\times M_i^{\\text{ref}}$. Substituting this, we get $O_i = (C \\times M_i^{\\text{ref}}) \\times PT_i^{\\text{study}} = C \\times E_i$.\nThe SMR is therefore:\n$$\n\\text{SMR} = \\frac{\\sum O_i}{\\sum E_i} = \\frac{\\sum (C \\times E_i)}{\\sum E_i} = \\frac{C \\times \\sum E_i}{\\sum E_i} = C\n$$\nThis shows that if the age-specific rate ratios are constant, the SMR is equal to that constant ratio. The data provided in this problem were constructed such that this assumption holds, as the rate ratio for each stratum is $1.25$:\n- Stratum 1: $(\\frac{25}{10{,}000}) / (\\frac{2}{1{,}000}) = 0.0025 / 0.002 = 1.25$\n- Stratum 2: $(\\frac{50}{5{,}000}) / (\\frac{8}{1{,}000}) = 0.01 / 0.008 = 1.25$\n- Stratum 3: $(\\frac{75}{2{,}000}) / (\\frac{30}{1{,}000}) = 0.0375 / 0.03 = 1.25$\nThus, both the direct computation and the conceptual interpretation under the stated assumption yield the same numerical value.

To control confounding by neighborhood socioeconomic status, a binary person attribute $C \\in \\{0,1\\}$ (where $C=1$ indicates high socioeconomic status and $C=0$ indicates low socioeconomic status) is used for matching. Specifically, controls are sampled so that the distribution of $C$ among controls approximates the distribution of $C$ among cases.\n\nThe sample yields the following counts by stratum of $C$:\n\n- For $C=0$: cases with $E=1$ are $48$, cases with $E=0$ are $72$; controls with $E=1$ are $30$, controls with $E=0$ are $90$.\n- For $C=1$: cases with $E=1$ are $100$, cases with $E=0$ are $50$; controls with $E=1$ are $75$, controls with $E=0$ are $75$.\n\nUsing only core definitions and well-tested facts from epidemiology, consider the following:\n\n- A confounder $C$ is a variable associated with the exposure $E$ and the disease $D$ that is not on the causal pathway from $E$ to $D$.\n- Matching is a sampling design feature that constrains $P(C \\mid D=1)$ and $P(C \\mid D=0)$ to be similar in the sampled data.\n- Selection bias arises when selection into the study, denoted by a selection indicator $S$, depends jointly on exposure and other variables (here the matching factor $C$), such that $P(S=1 \\mid E=1)$ differs from $P(S=1 \\mid E=0)$ for controls because of the matching.\n\nWhich option best justifies how matching controls confounding by $C$ in this study but may introduce selection bias if the matching factor is not properly accounted for in the analysis, and correctly characterizes the implications for the odds ratio (OR) estimates from crude versus stratified analyses?\n\nA. Matching balances $C$ between cases and controls in the sample, thereby addressing confounding by $C$. However, because control selection is constrained by $C$ and $E$ is associated with $C$, the exposure odds among controls depend on the matching, so ignoring $C$ in analysis can introduce selection bias.

Matching is a sampling strategy, not an analysis strategy. By deliberately selecting controls based on a factor $C$, we control for confounding by $C$ (by breaking the $C-D$ link in the sample). However, if the matching factor $C$ is also associated with the exposure $E$ in the population from which controls are drawn, then matching can induce a form of selection bias if the analysis does not account for the matching. The correct way to analyze the data is to perform a stratified analysis, conditioning on the matching factor $C$.\n\nFirst, let's verify if $C$ is associated with $E$ in the control population (our proxy for the source population).\n- In the $C=0$ stratum, the odds of exposure among controls are $30/90 = 1/3$.\n- In the $C=1$ stratum, the odds of exposure among controls are $75/75 = 1$.\nSince the odds of exposure differ ($1/3 \\neq 1$), $C$ is associated with $E$. Therefore, a crude (unstratified) analysis is expected to produce a biased odds ratio.\n\n**1.

The common odds ratio is $2.0$. The Mantel-Haenszel (MH) odds ratio is the appropriate adjusted summary measure and will equal this common value. As calculated in option A, the MH odds ratio is indeed $2.0$.\n\nThe calculations show that the crude odds ratio ($1.906$) is biased relative to the adjusted odds ratio ($2.0$). This discrepancy is a direct result of ignoring the matching factor in the analysis.\n\nOption A correctly explains this principle: matching controls confounding but can introduce selection bias if not accounted for in the analysis. It provides the correct calculations for both the crude ($OR \\approx 1.906$) and the adjusted ($OR_{MH} = 2.0$) estimates, demonstrating the bias.
