The fundamental base for this derivation is conservation of mass for a conservative tracer in a well-mixed volume and the ideal gas approximation, wherein volumetric fraction equals molar fraction at uniform temperature and pressure. Carbon dioxide is used as an occupant-emitted tracer. The classroom has volume $V = 240$ cubic meters, with $N = 30$ occupants engaged in light activity. Each occupant emits carbon dioxide at a volumetric rate $r = 0.30$ liters per minute.

A rigorous solution can be constructed.\n\nThe ventilation rate, expressed as Air Changes per Hour (ACH), can be derived from a mass balance of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) in the classroom, which is treated as a single control volume. The governing principle is the conservation of mass.\n\nLet $C(t)$ be the volumetric fraction of CO$_2$ inside the classroom at time $t$, and let $C_{out}$ be the constant volumetric fraction of CO$_2$ in the outdoor air. The total volume of CO$_2$ in the room is $V C(t)$. The rate of accumulation of CO$_2$ mass (or volume, under the ideal gas assumption at constant temperature and pressure) within the control volume is given by the time derivative of this quantity.\n\nThe mass balance equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{d(V C(t))}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of CO}_2\\text{ in}) - (\\text{Rate of CO}_2\\text{ out}) + (\\text{Rate of CO}_2\\text{ generation})\n$$\n\nLet $Q$ be the volumetric flow rate of outdoor air into the classroom (in units of m$^3$/h). This is the ventilation rate.\n- The rate of CO$_2$ inflow is $Q C_{out}$.\n- Since the room is assumed to be well-mixed, the concentration of the air exiting the room is the same as the concentration inside, $C(t)$. Thus, the rate of CO$_2$ outflow is $Q C(t)$.\n- The rate of CO$_2$ generation, $G$, is the product of the number of occupants, $N$, and the emission rate per occupant, $r$.\n$$\nG = N \\times r\n$$\n\nSubstituting these terms into the balance equation, and noting that the volume $V$ is constant:\n$$\nV \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = Q C_{out} - Q C(t) + G\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the system is at steady state. At steady state, the concentration inside the room, $C_{ss}$, is constant, which means its time derivative is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_{ss}}{dt} = 0\n$$\n\nThe balance equation at steady state becomes:\n$$\n0 = Q C_{out} - Q C_{ss} + G\n$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the ventilation rate $Q$:\n$$\nQ C_{ss} - Q C_{out} = G\n$$\n$$\nQ (C_{ss} - C_{out}) = G\n$$\n\nThe problem defines the steady-state elevation in concentration as $\\Delta C = C_{ss} - C_{out}$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$\nQ \\Delta C = G\n$$\nSolving for $Q$:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{G}{\\Delta C} = \\frac{N \\times r}{\\Delta C}\n$$\n\nNow, we must use consistent units to compute the numerical value. We will convert all quantities to units involving meters and hours.\nThe given parameters are:\n- $N = 30$ (dimensionless)\n- $V = 240 \\text{ m}^3$\n- $r = 0.30 \\frac{\\text{L}}{\\text{min}}$\n- $\\Delta C = 900 \\text{ ppm} = 900 \\times 10^{-6}$ (dimensionless volumetric fraction)\n\nFirst, we convert the generation rate per person, $r$, to units of $\\text{m}^3/\\text{h}$:\n$$\nr = 0.30 \\frac{\\text{L}}{\\text{min}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ m}^3}{1000 \\text{ L}} \\times \\frac{60 \\text{ min}}{1 \\text{ h}} = 0.30 \\times \\frac{60}{1000} \\frac{\\text{m}^3}{\\text{h}} = 0.018 \\frac{\\text{m}^3}{\\text{h}}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the total generation rate, $G$:\n$$\nG = N \\times r = 30 \\times 0.018 \\frac{\\text{m}^3}{\\text{h}} = 0.54 \\frac{\\text{m}^3}{\\text{h}}\n$$\nNow, we can calculate the volumetric ventilation rate, $Q$:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{G}{\\Delta C} = \\frac{0.54 \\frac{\\text{m}^3}{\\text{h}}}{900 \\times 10^{-6}} = \\frac{0.54}{9 \\times 10^{-4}} \\frac{\\text{m}^3}{\\text{h}} = \\frac{0.06}{10^{-4}} \\frac{\\text{m}^3}{\\text{h}} = 600 \\frac{\\text{m}^3}{\\text{h}}\n$$\nThe Air Changes per Hour (ACH) is defined as the ratio of the volumetric ventilation rate $Q$ to the room volume $V$. It represents how many times the air in the volume is replaced per hour.\n$$\n\\text{ACH} = \\frac{Q}{V}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated value for $Q$ and the given value for $V$:\n$$\n\\text{ACH} = \\frac{600 \\frac{\\text{m}^3}{\\text{h}}}{240 \\text{ m}^3} = \\frac{600}{240} \\text{ h}^{-1} = \\frac{60}{24} \\text{ h}^{-1} = \\frac{10}{4} \\text{ h}^{-1} = 2.5 \\text{ h}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\text{ACH} = 2.50 \\text{ h}^{-1}\n$$\n\nFinally, a discussion on the main sources of error in this method:\n1.  **Imperfect Mixing Assumption**: Real-world spaces are not perfectly mixed. Air stratification and stagnant zones are common. If the CO$_2$ sensor is placed in a location with better-than-average ventilation (e.g., near an air supply vent), it will measure a lower $\\Delta C$, leading to an *overestimation* of the calculated ACH ($Q = G/\\Delta C$). Conversely, if placed in a poorly-ventilated zone or too close to occupants, it will measure a higher $\\Delta C$, leading to an *underestimation* of the overall ACH.\n2.  **CO$_2$ Emission Rate ($r$) Estimation**: The metabolic rate and corresponding CO$_2$ emission rate vary significantly among individuals and with activity level. The value $r = 0.30$ L/min is an approximation for light activity. If the occupants' actual average activity is higher than assumed, the true generation rate $G$ is higher. Using a lower, assumed $G$ in the calculation results in an *underestimation* of the true ACH. If the actual activity is lower (e.g., during a silent exam), the true $G$ is lower, and using the assumed $G$ leads to an *overestimation* of ACH.\n3.  **Non-Steady-State Conditions**: Occupancy levels, ventilation rates, and occupant activity can change over time. If a measurement of $\\Delta C$ is taken before the system has reached a true steady state (i.e., while CO$_2$ levels are still rising), the measured $\\Delta C$ will be lower than the true steady-state value. This would lead to an *overestimation* of the ACH.\n4.  **Unaccounted Sinks or Sources**: The model assumes occupants are the only source and there are no sinks. If other sources of CO$_2$ exist (e.g., laboratory equipment, combustion), the total generation $G$ is higher than accounted for, leading to an *underestimation* of the ACH. If sinks exist (e.g., plants performing photosynthesis, chemical absorption), the measured $\\Delta C$ would be lower for a given ventilation rate, leading to an *overestimation* of the ACH.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2.50}\n$$", "id": "4570625"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond qualitative statements, Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) provides the tools to estimate the likelihood of infection from exposure to contaminated environments.

It is a well-posed, scientifically sound problem in the field of epidemiology. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the infection probability based on first principles.\n\nFirst, we calculate the expected ingested dose, $D$. According to the problem statement, the dose is the product of the pathogen concentration, $C$, and the volume of water consumed, $V$.\n\n$$\nD = C \\times V\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n$$\nD = (10\\,\\mathrm{CFU/L}) \\times (2\\,\\mathrm{L}) = 20\\,\\mathrm{CFU}\n$$\n\nThis value, $D=20$, represents the average number of colony-forming units ingested. This is the requested intermediate value.\n\nSecond, we model the number of pathogens ingested. The problem states that pathogen counts follow a Poisson process. Therefore, the probability of ingesting exactly $k$ pathogens, where $k$ is a non-negative integer, is given by the Poisson probability mass function with mean $\\lambda = D$:\n\n$$\nP(k; D) = \\frac{D^k \\exp(-D)}{k!}\n$$\n\nThird, we model the probability of infection. The problem states that each of the $k$ ingested pathogens acts independently to cause infection, with a per-organism probability of infection equal to $r$. The probability that a single pathogen does *not* cause infection is therefore $1-r$. Given the independence of pathogens, the probability that *none* of the $k$ ingested pathogens cause an infection is $(1-r)^k$.\n\nThe event of an infection occurring is the complement of the event that no infection occurs. Thus, the probability of infection, given that exactly $k$ pathogens were ingested, is:\n\n$$\nP(\\text{infection} | k) = 1 - (1-r)^k\n$$\nThis relationship holds for $k \\ge 1$. For $k=0$ (no pathogens ingested), the probability of infection is $0$, which is consistent with the formula as $1 - (1-r)^0 = 1-1=0$.\n\nFinally, to find the overall probability of infection, $P_{inf}$, we must account for all possible numbers of ingested pathogens, $k$. We do this by summing the conditional probabilities of infection over the Poisson distribution of $k$, an application of the law of total probability:\n\n$$\nP_{inf} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} P(\\text{infection} | k) P(k; D)\n$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the conditional probability and the Poisson distribution:\n\n$$\nP_{inf} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} [1 - (1-r)^k] \\frac{D^k \\exp(-D)}{k!}\n$$\n\nWe can split this summation into two parts:\n\n$$\nP_{inf} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{D^k \\exp(-D)}{k!} - \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (1-r)^k \\frac{D^k \\exp(-D)}{k!}\n$$\n\nThe first term is the sum of all probabilities of a Poisson distribution, which is equal to $1$:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{D^k \\exp(-D)}{k!} = \\exp(-D) \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{D^k}{k!} = \\exp(-D) \\exp(D) = 1\n$$\n\nFor the second term, we can rearrange the expression:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (1-r)^k \\frac{D^k \\exp(-D)}{k!} = \\exp(-D) \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{[D(1-r)]^k}{k!}\n$$\n\nThe summation is the Taylor series for $\\exp(D(1-r))$. Therefore, the second term becomes:\n\n$$\n\\exp(-D) \\exp(D(1-r)) = \\exp(-D + D - Dr) = \\exp(-Dr)\n$$\n\nCombining the two terms, we derive the formula for the exponential dose-response model:\n\n$$\nP_{inf} = 1 - \\exp(-Dr)\n$$\nThis derivation confirms that the \"exponential dose-response parameter $r$\" given in the problem is indeed the parameter in the exponent of this final model.\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values for $D$ and $r$ to compute the infection probability:\n$D = 20$\n$r = 0.01$\n\n$$\nP_{inf} = 1 - \\exp(-20 \\times 0.01) = 1 - \\exp(-0.2)\n$$\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$\\exp(-0.2) \\approx 0.81873075...$\n$P_{inf} \\approx 1 - 0.81873075 = 0.18126925...$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n\n$$\nP_{inf} \\approx 0.1813\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1813}\n$$", "id": "4570607"}, {"introduction": "Foodborne illnesses can be caused by either active infection or, as in this case, the ingestion of pre-formed toxins produced by bacteria in the food—a critical distinction known as food intoxication.

The portion is unsafe because the ingested SE dose is on the order of $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$ (exceeding $D_{\\min}$), and reheating does not inactivate preformed SE.**\nOur calculation derived an ingested dose of $1.164\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$, which is \"on the order of $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$\". This dose ($1164\\,\\mathrm{ng}$) exceeds the minimal emetic dose $D_{\\min}$ ($200\\,\\mathrm{ng}$). The reason given about reheating not inactivating the preformed toxin is also consistent with the problem's premises. Therefore, the portion is unsafe. This option is fully consistent with our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The portion is likely safe because SE production would begin only near stationary phase, which is not reached here; the ingested SE dose is $100\\,\\mathrm{ng}$.**\nThis option introduces an external, unsubstantiated assumption that toxin production requires stationary phase. The problem defines the trigger for toxin production as a specific cell density, $N_{\\mathrm{thr}}$, which is reached during the exponential growth phase. Our calculation shows the ingested dose is $\\approx 1164\\,\\mathrm{ng}$, which is significantly greater than $100\\,\\mathrm{ng}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The risk cannot be assessed without post-reheating CFU counts, because illness requires ingestion of viable cells rather than preformed toxin.**\nThis statement misrepresents the pathology of this specific foodborne illness. Staphylococcal food poisoning is a classic example of a food intoxication, where the illness is caused by a preformed toxin, not an active infection by ingested viable cells. The problem correctly links the clinical response to the \"minimal emetic dose\" of SE, not the number of viable cells.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4570611"}]}
