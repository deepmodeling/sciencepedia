A \"sufficient cause\" is defined as a minimal set of \"component causes\" whose joint occurrence is sufficient to produce the disease within the time window of interest. A \"component cause\" is any individual element of a sufficient cause. For a given individual, a particular component cause $C$ is \"necessary\" if every sufficient cause that could produce that individual's disease within the time window includes $C$.\n\nSuppose a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is conducted in a population where $C$ is believed to be involved in at least some sufficient causes. Individuals are randomly assigned at baseline either to an intervention that entirely eliminates $C$ for the duration of follow-up without affecting the occurrence of other component causes, or to a control condition in which $C$ is left unaltered. Let $I_{1}$ denote the cumulative incidence of the disease in the control arm over the follow-up period, and let $I_{0}$ denote the cumulative incidence in the intervention arm over the same period. Assume the trial satisfies consistency, exchangeability, and positivity, and assume monotonicity over the time window in the sense that eliminating $C$ cannot increase an individual's risk of disease during follow-up relative to leaving $C$ unaltered.\n\nUnder these conditions, derive from first principles an expression for the necessary cause fraction among cases in the population during the follow-up period—that is, the proportion of cases for whom $C$ was necessary—and then compute its value given $I_{1} = 0.24$ and $I_{0} = 0.09$. Express your final answer as a decimal, and no rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the necessary cause fraction among cases from first principles within the sufficient-cause framework, and its calculation given specific incidence data from a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT).\n\nFirst, let us formalize the concepts outlined in the problem statement. The setting is an RCT where a population is randomized into two arms.\n-   Control arm ($X=1$): Component cause $C$ is left unaltered. The cumulative incidence of the disease is $I_{1}$.\n-   Intervention arm ($X=0$): Component cause $C$ is entirely eliminated. The cumulative incidence of the disease is $I_{0}$.\n\nThe problem provides the following critical assumptions:\n1.  **Exchangeability**: Because of randomization, the two arms are comparable on average with respect to all other factors that could cause the disease. This means the underlying risk profiles are the same in both groups, apart from the presence or absence of $C$.\n2.  **Consistency**: The observed outcome for an individual corresponds to the potential outcome under the exposure they actually received.\n3.  **Monotonicity**: The elimination of $C$ cannot cause the disease in any individual. That is, if an individual develops the disease when $C$ is absent, they would also have developed it if $C$ had been present.\n\nLet's use the potential outcomes framework to formalize the problem. Let $D_x$ be the potential outcome for disease for an individual, where $x$ indicates the exposure status. $D_{1}=1$ if the person gets the disease when $C$ is present (control condition), and $D_{1}=0$ otherwise. $D_{0}=1$ if the person gets the disease when $C$ is eliminated (intervention condition), and $D_{0}=0$ otherwise.\n\nDue to exchangeability and consistency, the observed incidences in the study arms are equal to the population probabilities of the corresponding potential outcomes:\n$$I_{1} = P(D = 1 | X=1) = P(D_{1}=1)$$\n$$I_{0} = P(D = 1 | X=0) = P(D_{0}=1)$$\n\nThe monotonicity assumption implies that for any individual in the population, $D_{0} \\le D_{1}$. This forbids the case where an individual would get the disease only when $C$ is eliminated (i.e., $D_{0}=1$ and $D_{1}=0$).\n\nThe population can be stratified into four mutually exclusive groups based on their potential outcome pairs $(D_{1}, D_{0})$:\n1.  Individuals for whom $(D_{1}=1, D_{0}=1)$: These individuals develop the disease regardless of the presence of $C$. Their disease is caused by sufficient causes that do not include $C$.\n2.  Individuals for whom $(D_{1}=1, D_{0}=0)$: These individuals develop the disease only if $C$ is present. For this group, $C$ is a necessary component of the sufficient cause that results in their disease within the follow-up period.\n3.  Individuals for whom $(D_{1}=0, D_{0}=1)$: The monotonicity assumption ensures that the proportion of such individuals in the population is zero.\n4.  Individuals for whom $(D_{1}=0, D_{0}=0)$: These individuals do not develop the disease under either condition during the follow-up.\n\nThe incidence in the control arm, $I_{1}$, represents the total proportion of individuals who would get the disease if $C$ were present. This includes those who get sick regardless of $C$ and those who get sick only because of $C$.\n$$I_{1} = P(D_{1}=1) = P(D_{1}=1, D_{0}=1) + P(D_{1}=1, D_{0}=0)$$\n\nThe incidence in the intervention arm, $I_{0}$, represents the proportion of individuals who get the disease even when $C$ is eliminated. These are the individuals whose disease is caused by mechanisms not involving $C$.\n$$I_{0} = P(D_{0}=1) = P(D_{1}=1, D_{0}=1) + P(D_{1}=0, D_{0}=1)$$\nBy the monotonicity assumption, $P(D_{1}=0, D_{0}=1) = 0$, so this simplifies to:\n$$I_{0} = P(D_{1}=1, D_{0}=1)$$\n\nThis term, $I_{0}$, represents the \"background\" incidence—the incidence due to sufficient causes that do not contain $C$.\n\nWe can now express the proportion of individuals for whom $C$ is a necessary component cause. These are the individuals corresponding to the stratum $(D_{1}=1, D_{0}=0)$.\n$$P(D_{1}=1, D_{0}=0) = I_{1} - P(D_{1}=1, D_{0}=1) = I_{1} - I_{0}$$\nThis quantity, $I_{1} - I_{0}$, is the risk difference. It isolates the incidence of disease that is causally attributable to the presence of $C$.\n\nThe problem asks for the \"necessary cause fraction among cases\". This is the proportion of individuals who develop the disease in the control condition (i.e., the \"cases\") for whom $C$ was a necessary cause. We can express this as a conditional probability:\n$ \\text{Fraction} = P(\\text{C is necessary} | \\text{Disease occurs}) $\nIn our notation, this is the probability that an individual is of type $(D_{1}=1, D_{0}=0)$, given that they are a case, i.e., $D_{1}=1$.\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = P(D_{0}=0 | D_{1}=1) = \\frac{P(D_{1}=1, D_{0}=0)}{P(D_{1}=1)} $$\n\nSubstituting the expressions we derived for the numerator and the denominator:\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = \\frac{I_{1} - I_{0}}{I_{1}} $$\nThis is the general expression for the necessary cause fraction among cases, also known as the attributable fraction or etiologic fraction.\n\nNow, we compute the value using the given data: $I_{1} = 0.24$ and $I_{0} = 0.09$.\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = \\frac{0.24 - 0.09}{0.24} $$\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = \\frac{0.15}{0.24} $$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can write it as:\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = \\frac{15}{24} = \\frac{3 \\times 5}{3 \\times 8} = \\frac{5}{8} $$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = 0.625 $$\nThus, among those who develop the disease in the population, $62.5\\%$ do so via a causal mechanism for which $C$ is a necessary component.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.625}$$", "id": "4580177"}, {"introduction": "While the previous exercise used experimental data, this practice builds a disease process from the ground up using a hypothetical model of causal pies.

Disease Risk in the Observed Setting**\nThe disease risk in the observed setting is the probability of event $D$, which we will denote as $R_1 = P(D)$.\nLet's define two intermediate events: $A = E \\cap (X \\cup Y)$ and $B = Z \\cap W$. The event $D$ is their union, $D = A \\cup B$.\nThe component causes involved in event $A$ are $\\{E, X, Y\\}$, and the component causes in event $B$ are $\\{Z, W\\}$. Since these sets of component causes are disjoint and all component causes are independent, the events $A$ and $B$ are independent.\nTherefore, the probability of their union is:\n$$R_1 = P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B)$$\nWe calculate $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ separately.\nDue to the independence of $Z$ and $W$:\n$$P(B) = P(Z \\cap W) = P(Z)P(W) = p_{Z} p_{W}$$\nFor $P(A)$, we use the independence of $E$ from $X$ and $Y$:\n$$P(A) = P(E \\cap (X \\cup Y)) = P(E)P(X \\cup Y) = p_{E}P(X \\cup Y)$$\nThe probability $P(X \\cup Y)$, using the independence of $X$ and $Y$, is:\n$$P(X \\cup Y) = P(X) + P(Y) - P(X \\cap Y) = p_{X} + p_{Y} - p_{X}p_{Y}$$\nSubstituting the given probability values:\n$$p_X + p_Y - p_X p_Y = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{4} - \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{4}{20} + \\frac{5}{20} - \\frac{1}{20} = \\frac{8}{20} = \\frac{2}{5}$$\nSo, $P(A) = p_{E} \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{3}{10} \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{6}{50} = \\frac{3}{25}$.\nAnd, $P(B) = p_{Z} p_{W} = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{3}{100}$.\n\nNow we can calculate the total risk $R_1$:\n$$R_1 = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B) = \\frac{3}{25} + \\frac{3}{100} - \\left(\\frac{3}{25}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{100}\\right)$$\n$$R_1 = \\frac{12}{100} + \\frac{3}{100} - \\frac{9}{2500} = \\frac{15}{100} - \\frac{9}{2500} = \\frac{3}{20} - \\frac{9}{2500}$$\nTo subtract, we find a common denominator, which is $2500$:\n$$R_1 = \\frac{3 \\times 125}{20 \\times 125} - \\frac{9}{2500} = \\frac{375}{2500} - \\frac{9}{2500} = \\frac{366}{2500} = \\frac{183}{1250}$$\nThe disease risk in the observed setting is $R_1 = \\frac{183}{1250}$.\n\n**2. Disease Risk Under Elimination of E**\nWe are asked to find the disease risk in a counterfactual scenario where exposure $E$ is eliminated. This means we set $p_E = 0$. Let's denote the risk in this scenario as $R_0$.\nWhen $p_E = 0$, the probability of event $E$ is $0$.\nThe mechanisms $\\mathrm{SC}_1$ ($E \\cap X$) and $\\mathrm{SC}_2$ ($E \\cap Y$) can no longer be completed, as $P(E \\cap X) = P(E)P(X) = 0 \\times p_X = 0$ and $P(E \\cap Y) = P(E)P(Y) = 0 \\times p_Y = 0$.\nThe only remaining causal mechanism is $\\mathrm{SC}_3$ ($Z \\cap W$). Therefore, the disease occurs only if $\\mathrm{SC}_3$ is completed.\nThe risk $R_0$ is the probability of this event:\n$$R_0 = P(Z \\cap W) = p_{Z}p_{W} = \\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{10}\\right) = \\frac{3}{100}$$\nThe disease risk under elimination of $E$ is $R_0 = \\frac{3}{100}$.\n\n**3. Population Attributable Fraction (PAF)**\nThe problem defines the PAF as the proportion of cases that would be prevented by eliminating the exposure. Let $R_1$ be the risk with the exposure and $R_0$ be the risk without it. The risk reduction is $R_1 - R_0$. The PAF is this reduction as a fraction of the original risk $R_1$.\n$$PAF = \\frac{R_1 - R_0}{R_1}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $R_1$ and $R_0$:\n$$PAF = \\frac{\\frac{183}{1250} - \\frac{3}{100}}{\\frac{183}{1250}}$$\nTo compute the numerator, we find a common denominator for $1250$ and $100$, which is $2500$.\n$$R_1 = \\frac{183}{1250} = \\frac{366}{2500}$$\n$$R_0 = \\frac{3}{100} = \\frac{75}{2500}$$\nThe risk difference is:\n$$R_1 - R_0 = \\frac{366}{2500} - \\frac{75}{2500} = \\frac{291}{2500}$$\nNow, we can compute the PAF:\n$$PAF = \\frac{\\frac{291}{2500}}{\\frac{366}{2500}} = \\frac{291}{366}$$\nTo simplify this fraction, we find the prime factorization of the numerator and denominator.\n$291 = 3 \\times 97$. ($97$ is a prime number).\n$366 = 3 \\times 122$.\n$$PAF = \\frac{3 \\times 97}{3 \\times 122} = \\frac{97}{122}$$\nThe prime factorization of $122$ is $2 \\times 61$.
