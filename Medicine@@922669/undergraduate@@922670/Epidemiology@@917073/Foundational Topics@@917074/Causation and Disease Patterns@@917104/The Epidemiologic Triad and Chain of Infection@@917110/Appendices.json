In the language of the epidemiologic triad, the agent is characterized by a constant quanta generation rate per infectious host, the host susceptibility is assumed uniform with identical breathing rates, and the environment is characterized by mechanical ventilation that removes quanta from air. Consider a single infectious source and a group of susceptible individuals sharing the same room air. Assume the following:\n\n- The room air is well mixed at all times, with only mechanical ventilation removing quanta.\n- The infectious source emits quanta at a constant rate and the system reaches a quasi-steady state rapidly relative to the total exposure time, so that a steady concentration can be used over the exposure interval.\n- Each susceptible host inhales air at a constant volumetric rate, independent of time, and infection occurs via inhalation of infectious quanta modeled as a Poisson process (that is, the probability of avoiding infection after inhaling a mean dose equals the exponential of its negative).\n- Hosts act independently and share identical exposure conditions.\n\nData:\n\n- Quanta generation rate per infectious source: $q = 50$ quanta per hour.\n- Number of infectious sources: $I = 1$.\n- Total occupancy: $N = 25$ persons.\n- Exposure duration: $t = 2$ hours.\n- Room ventilation volumetric flow rate (clean air supply plus exhaust): $Q = 600 \\, \\mathrm{m}^3$ per hour.\n- Pulmonary ventilation (breathing) rate per susceptible host: $p = 0.6 \\, \\mathrm{m}^3$ per hour.\n\nStarting only from core principles appropriate to this context—namely, conservation of infectious quanta in a well-mixed control volume with ventilation removal, and the Poisson model for infection based on inhaled quanta dose—derive an expression for the expected number of new infections among the susceptible occupants and evaluate it numerically for the given parameters. Express the final expected number of infections as a pure number (no units) and round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The first principle is the conservation of infectious quanta in the control volume of the room. Let $C_q$ be the concentration of infectious quanta in the room air (in units of quanta per cubic meter). In a well-mixed space, the rate of change of the total number of quanta in the room is the difference between the generation rate and the removal rate.\nThe total generation rate is the product of the number of infectious sources, $I$, and the quanta generation rate per source, $q$.\n$$ \\text{Generation Rate} = I q $$\nThe removal rate is due to ventilation, where air containing quanta at concentration $C_q$ is removed at a volumetric flow rate $Q$.\n$$ \\text{Removal Rate} = C_q Q $$\nThe mass balance equation is:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\text{Total Quanta})}{d\\tau} = \\text{Generation Rate} - \\text{Removal Rate} $$\nAssuming a room volume $V$, the total number of quanta is $C_q V$. The equation becomes:\n$$ V \\frac{dC_q}{d\\tau} = I q - C_q Q $$\nThe problem states that the system can be considered to be in a quasi-steady state. At steady state, the concentration does not change with time, so $\\frac{dC_q}{d\\tau} = 0$. This leads to:\n$$ 0 = I q - C_q Q $$\nSolving for the steady-state concentration $C_q$, we find:\n$$ C_q = \\frac{I q}{Q} $$\n\nThe second principle is the calculation of the inhaled dose and the resulting infection probability. Each susceptible host breathes air at a pulmonary ventilation rate $p$. The rate at which a susceptible individual inhales quanta is the product of the quanta concentration in the air and their breathing rate:\n$$ \\text{Rate of Quanta Inhalation} = C_q p $$\nThe total number of quanta inhaled by one susceptible person over the exposure duration $t$ is the mean dose, $D$.\n$$ D = C_q p t $$\nSubstituting the expression for the steady-state concentration $C_q$:\n$$ D = \\left(\\frac{I q}{Q}\\right) p t = \\frac{I q p t}{Q} $$\n\nThe third principle is the Poisson model for infection. The probability that a susceptible individual *avoids* infection after inhaling a mean dose $D$ is given by the zeroth term of the Poisson distribution:\n$$ P(\\text{no infection}) = \\exp(-D) $$\nConsequently, the probability of becoming infected, which is the complement, is:\n$$ P(\\text{infection}) = 1 - P(\\text{no infection}) = 1 - \\exp(-D) $$\nSubstituting the expression for the dose $D$, we get the probability of infection for a single susceptible individual:\n$$ P(\\text{infection}) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{I q p t}{Q}\\right) $$\nThis quantity is also known as the attack rate.\n\nFinally, we need to find the expected number of new infections, denoted as $E[C_{new}]$. The number of susceptible individuals, $S$, is the total occupancy $N$ minus the number of infectious sources $I$.\n$$ S = N - I $$\nSince all susceptible hosts are independent and have the same probability of infection, the expected number of new infections is the product of the number of susceptible individuals and the probability of infection for any one of them.\n$$ E[C_{new}] = S \\times P(\\text{infection}) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $S$ and $P(\\text{infection})$ gives the final formula:\n$$ E[C_{new}] = (N - I) \\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{I q p t}{Q}\\right)\\right] $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression.\nThe given data are:\n$q = 50$\n$I = 1$\n$N = 25$\n$t = 2$\n$Q = 600$\n$p = 0.6$\n\nFirst, calculate the number of susceptible individuals:\n$$ S = N - I = 25 - 1 = 24 $$\nNext, calculate the argument of the exponential function, which corresponds to the mean inhaled dose $D$:\n$$ D = \\frac{I q p t}{Q} = \\frac{(1)(50)(0.6)(2)}{600} = \\frac{60}{600} = 0.1 $$\nThe units are consistent: $\\frac{(\\mathrm{quanta}/\\mathrm{hr}) (\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{hr}) (\\mathrm{hr})}{\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{hr}} = \\mathrm{quanta}$.

The cases are clustered in time. The time from the exposure to the onset of symptoms for these primary cases defines the **incubation period**, $\\tau$. The spread of the peak is determined by the variation in $\\tau$ among the exposed population.\n    - **Chain of Infection:** The key elements are the agent, a common reservoir/vehicle (the meal), a portal of entry (ingestion), and a susceptible host. The mode of transmission is from the vehicle to the host. In a *pure* point-source outbreak, there is no subsequent person-to-person transmission.\n\n2.  **Propagated (Person-to-Person) Outbreak:** This type of outbreak is spread by transmission from one person to another.\n    - **Exposure:** Exposures are not simultaneous but occur serially over time.\n    - **Epidemic Curve:** This results in a series of progressively taller peaks, each representing a new \"generation\" of cases. The time interval between successive peaks approximates the **serial interval**, $s$. The outbreak continues until the number of susceptible individuals falls or control measures become effective.\n    - **Chain of Infection:** This involves the full chain: an agent exiting a human reservoir (the infected person) through a portal of exit (e.g., fecal-oral route), being transmitted via a mode of transmission (e.g., direct contact), and entering a new susceptible host through a portal of entry.\n\n**Analysis of the Scenario:**\n\n- The cases among meal attendees ($42$ at $t=1$ day, $28$ at $t=2$ days) represent the **point-source component**. The common vehicle is the meal at $t=0$. The incubation period, $\\tau$, for this agent is approximately $1-2$ days. The positive environmental sample confirms this.\n- The cases among non-attendees ($12$ at $t=3$, $9$ at $t=5$, $4$ at $t=7$ days) who are household contacts represent the **propagated component**. These are secondary cases (and potentially tertiary, etc.).\n- The time from onset in primary cases (e.g., median onset at $t \\approx 1.5$ days) to onset in secondary cases (e.g., first cluster at $t=3$ days) gives an estimate of the serial interval, $s$. For a primary case with onset at $t=1$, a secondary case at $t=3$ implies $s = 3 - 1 = 2$ days. This is consistent with subsequent person-to-person transmission. The contact tracing data ($p=0.90$ contact) provides strong evidence for this mode of transmission.\n- This scenario depicts a **mixed outbreak**, which begins as a point-source and then initiates propagated transmission. The criteria to distinguish the two *types* of transmission are clearly illustrated by the two *components* of this single outbreak.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Cases are largely confined to a single window corresponding to one incubation period $\\tau$ after a single exposure at $t=0$; the epidemic curve shows a steep upslope and more gradual downslope; there is minimal transmission to persons without exposure to the source (few secondary cases), and the chain of infection indicates a common vehicle as the dominant mode of transmission.**\n- **Justification:** This option provides a precise and accurate description of the defining features of a *pure* point-source outbreak. Each element—the temporal clustering of cases one incubation period after exposure, the classic epidemic curve shape, the confinement of cases to the exposed group, and the common vehicle transmission mode—is a valid criterion for identifying this pattern and distinguishing it from a propagated one.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Successive peaks on the epidemic curve are separated by approximately one serial interval $s$; there is clear occurrence of cases among persons without exposure to the common source but with direct contact to earlier cases; the chain of infection is dominated by person-to-person transmission with household clustering.**\n- **Justification:** This option provides a precise and accurate description of the defining features of a propagated outbreak. The periodic peaks separated by the serial interval, the evidence of transmission to non-exposed contacts, and the dominance of person-to-person transmission in the chain of infection are the classic hallmarks of this outbreak type. These criteria stand in direct contrast to those of a point-source outbreak.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**C. When the agent has a short incubation period $\\tau$, multiple peaks cannot indicate propagation; therefore temporal patterns are not useful for distinguishing point-source from propagated outbreaks, and classification should rely solely on laboratory confirmation of the source.**\n- **Justification:** This statement is fundamentally incorrect. The length of the incubation period $\\tau$ does not negate the significance of multiple peaks. Multiple peaks separated by the serial interval $s$ are the primary temporal signature of propagation, regardless of whether $\\tau$ is short or long. A short $\\tau$ and short $s$ will simply result in peaks that are closer together. Dismissing temporal patterns is contrary to fundamental epidemiological practice. While lab confirmation is vital, it is only one part of the evidence; relying on it solely, while ignoring the epidemic curve and contact tracing, is an error that could lead to missing the propagated component of an outbreak.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. In point-source outbreaks, changes in contact rates after control measures produce new peaks at intervals equal to $s$, whereas in propagated outbreaks control measures have no predictable effect on peak timing; thus peak spacing is a criterion unique to point-source outbreaks.**\n- **Justification:** This statement reverses the concepts and contains multiple falsehoods. New peaks separated by the serial interval $s$ are characteristic of **propagated** outbreaks, not point-source ones. A pure point-source outbreak has only one peak related to $\\tau$. Control measures in a propagated outbreak are specifically intended to have a predictable effect: to shrink or eliminate subsequent peaks by reducing transmission. The statement's logic is entirely backward.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. If the suspected vehicle is food and environmental sampling is positive, the outbreak must be point-source regardless of the epidemic curve or evidence of household transmission; vehicle identification alone suffices to classify the outbreak type.**\n- **Justification:** This is a flawed oversimplification. Positive vehicle identification confirms that a point-source event *initiated* the outbreak but does not rule out subsequent person-to-person spread. Many foodborne pathogens are also transmissible between people. A complete classification of the outbreak's dynamics requires an integrated analysis of all evidence, including the epidemic curve and contact tracing data, as demonstrated by the mixed outbreak in the problem scenario. Ignoring evidence of propagation is a critical failure in an investigation, as control measures would be incomplete.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "4644326"}, {"introduction": "To control an ongoing outbreak, public health officials must know if it is growing or shrinking.
