Work within the potential outcomes framework with potential outcomes $Y_1$ and $Y_0$, and assume the following foundational conditions: (i) randomization implies $X \\perp (Y_0,Y_1)$, (ii) the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) holds so that $Y = Y_X$, and (iii) monotonicity (no preventers) holds, so $Y_1 \\ge Y_0$ almost surely.\n\nUsing only these assumptions and the core definitions of the probabilities of necessity, sufficiency, and necessity-and-sufficiency, where\n- the probability of necessity is $PN = P(Y_0 = 0 \\mid X=1, Y=1)$,\n- the probability of sufficiency is $PS = P(Y_1 = 1 \\mid X=0, Y=0)$,\n- the probability of necessity-and-sufficiency is $PNS = P(Y_1=1, Y_0=0)$,\n\nfirst derive expressions for $PN$, $PS$, and $PNS$ in terms of $p_1$ and $p_0$ under the stated assumptions, and then evaluate them for $p_1=0.35$ and $p_0=0.10$.

The problem provides the observed risk in the exposed arm, $p_1 = P(Y=1 \\mid X=1)$, and in the unexposed arm, $p_0 = P(Y=1 \\mid X=0)$.\n\nUnder the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), an individual's observed outcome $Y$ is equal to their potential outcome under the exposure they actually received, i.e., $Y = Y_X$. This allows us to write:\n$p_1 = P(Y=1 \\mid X=1) = P(Y_1=1 \\mid X=1)$\n$p_0 = P(Y=1 \\mid X=0) = P(Y_0=1 \\mid X=0)$\n\nThe assumption of randomization, $X \\perp (Y_0, Y_1)$, implies that the exposure assignment is independent of the potential outcomes. This allows us to remove the conditioning on $X$:\n$P(Y_1=1 \\mid X=1) = P(Y_1=1)$\n$P(Y_0=1 \\mid X=0) = P(Y_0=1)$\n\nCombining these results, we establish the fundamental connection between the observable probabilities and the unobservable potential outcome probabilities:\n$p_1 = P(Y_1=1)$\n$p_0 = P(Y_0=1)$\n\nThe third crucial assumption is monotonicity, $Y_1 \\ge Y_0$, which states that the exposure does not prevent the outcome for any individual. This implies that the potential outcome pair $(Y_1=0, Y_0=1)$ cannot occur, so $P(Y_1=0, Y_0=1) = 0$. Consequently, the event $\\{Y_0=1\\}$ is a subset of the event $\\{Y_1=1\\}$, meaning that anyone who would have the outcome without exposure must also have it with exposure. This leads to the identity $P(Y_1=1, Y_0=1) = P(Y_0=1) = p_0$.\n\nNow we derive the expressions for $PNS$, $PN$, and $PS$.\n\n**1. Probability of Necessity-and-Sufficiency ($PNS$)**\n$PNS$ is defined as $P(Y_1=1, Y_0=0)$. This is the unconditional probability of an individual for whom the exposure is both a necessary cause (they would not have the outcome without it, $Y_0=0$) and a sufficient cause (they would have the outcome with it, $Y_1=1$). This group is often called \"compliers\" or the \"causally-affected\" subgroup.\nWe can express $P(Y_1=1)$ using the law of total probability, partitioning on the value of $Y_0$:\n$P(Y_1=1) = P(Y_1=1, Y_0=0) + P(Y_1=1, Y_0=1)$\nSubstituting the known quantities:\n$p_1 = PNS + P(Y_0=1)$\n$p_1 = PNS + p_0$\nSolving for $PNS$, we get:\n$PNS = p_1 - p_0$\n\nFor the given values $p_1 = 0.35$ and $p_0 = 0.10$:\n$PNS = 0.35 - 0.10 = 0.25 = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\n**2. Probability of Necessity ($PN$)**\n$PN$ is defined as $P(Y_0 = 0 \\mid X=1, Y=1)$. This quantity represents the probability that the exposure was necessary for the outcome to occur, for an individual who was in fact exposed and developed the outcome.\nUsing the definition of conditional probability:\n$PN = \\frac{P(Y_0=0, X=1, Y=1)}{P(X=1, Y=1)}$\nApplying SUTVA ($Y=Y_X$), the event $\\{X=1, Y=1\\}$ is equivalent to $\\{X=1, Y_1=1\\}$. The numerator event becomes $\\{Y_0=0, X=1, Y_1=1\\}$.\n$PN = \\frac{P(Y_0=0, Y_1=1, X=1)}{P(Y_1=1, X=1)}$\nBy the randomization assumption, $X$ is independent of $(Y_0, Y_1)$, so we can factor out $P(X=1)$:\n$PN = \\frac{P(Y_0=0, Y_1=1)P(X=1)}{P(Y_1=1)P(X=1)} = \\frac{P(Y_0=0, Y_1=1)}{P(Y_1=1)}$\nSubstituting the expressions we found earlier:\n$P(Y_0=0, Y_1=1) = PNS = p_1 - p_0$\n$P(Y_1=1) = p_1$\nTherefore, the expression for $PN$ is:\n$PN = \\frac{p_1 - p_0}{p_1}$\nThis is epidemiologically known as the attributable fraction among the exposed.\n\nFor the given values:\n$PN = \\frac{0.35 - 0.10}{0.35} = \\frac{0.25}{0.35} = \\frac{25}{35} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n**3. Probability of Sufficiency ($PS$)**\n$PS$ is defined as $P(Y_1 = 1 \\mid X=0, Y=0)$. This represents the probability that the exposure would have been sufficient to cause the outcome, for an individual who was not exposed and did not develop the outcome.\nUsing the definition of conditional probability:\n$PS = \\frac{P(Y_1=1, X=0, Y=0)}{P(X=0, Y=0)}$\nApplying SUTVA, the event $\\{X=0, Y=0\\}$ is equivalent to $\\{X=0, Y_0=0\\}$. The numerator event becomes $\\{Y_1=1, X=0, Y_0=0\\}$.\n$PS = \\frac{P(Y_1=1, Y_0=0, X=0)}{P(Y_0=0, X=0)}$\nBy randomization, $X$ is independent of $(Y_0, Y_1)$:\n$PS = \\frac{P(Y_1=1, Y_0=0)P(X=0)}{P(Y_0=0)P(X=0)} = \\frac{P(Y_1=1, Y_0=0)}{P(Y_0=0)}$\nWe know $P(Y_1=1, Y_0=0) = PNS = p_1 - p_0$. The denominator is $P(Y_0=0) = 1 - P(Y_0=1) = 1 - p_0$.\nTherefore, the expression for $PS$ is:\n$PS = \\frac{p_1 - p_0}{1 - p_0}$\n\nFor the given values:\n$PS = \\frac{0.35 - 0.10}{1 - 0.10} = \\frac{0.25}{0.90} = \\frac{25}{90} = \\frac{5}{18}$\n\nIn summary, the derived expressions are:\n$PNS = p_1 - p_0$\n$PN = \\frac{p_1 - p_0}{p_1}$\n$PS = \\frac{p_1 - p_0}{1 - p_0}$\n\nAnd their numerical values are:\n$PNS = \\frac{1}{4}$\n$PN = \\frac{5}{7}$\n$PS = \\frac{5}{18}$\n\nThe final answer is required as a row matrix in the order $(PN, PS, PNS)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{5}{7} & \\frac{5}{18} & \\frac{1}{4}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4613567"}, {"introduction": "Our journey into causal analysis now confronts a common obstacle in real-world research: imperfect measurement.

Let $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ represent the true counts in the cells $(E=1, Y=1)$, $(E=1, Y=0)$, $(E=0, Y=1)$, and $(E=0, Y=0)$ respectively.

Using the definition of conditional probability, we can write:\n$$PN = \\frac{P(Y_{1}=1, Y_{0}=0)}{P(Y_{1}=1)}$$\nThe population can be partitioned into four principal strata based on potential outcomes:\n1.  Compliers/Causally affected: $(Y_0=0, Y_1=1)$\n2.  Always-takers/Doomed: $(Y_0=1, Y_1=1)$\n3.  Never-takers/Immune: $(Y_0=0, Y_1=0)$\n4.  Defiers/Prevented: $(Y_0=1, Y_1=0)$\n\nThe monotonicity assumption, $Y_{1} \\geq Y_{0}$, implies that no individual is prevented from having the outcome by the exposure. This means the probability of being a \"defier\" is zero: $P(Y_0=1, Y_1=0) = 0$.\n\nUnder monotonicity, the probability of the outcome under exposure, $P(Y_1=1)$, can be decomposed as:\n$$P(Y_1=1) = P(Y_1=1, Y_0=0) + P(Y_1=1, Y_0=1)$$\nSimilarly, the probability of the outcome without exposure, $P(Y_0=1)$, is:\n$$P(Y_0=1) = P(Y_0=1, Y_1=0) + P(Y_0=1, Y_1=1)$$\nSince monotonicity forces $P(Y_0=1, Y_1=0) = 0$, this simplifies to $P(Y_0=1) = P(Y_1=1, Y_0=1)$. This means that anyone who would have the outcome without exposure must also have it with exposure (the \"always-takers\").\n\nSubstituting $P(Y_1=1, Y_0=1) = P(Y_0=1)$ into the decomposition of $P(Y_1=1)$ gives:\n$$P(Y_1=1) = P(Y_1=1, Y_0=0) + P(Y_0=1)$$\nRearranging this equation allows us to express the numerator of the $PN$ formula:\n$$P(Y_1=1, Y_0=0) = P(Y_1=1) - P(Y_0=1)$$\nNow we substitute this back into the definition of $PN$:\n$$PN = \\frac{P(Y_1=1) - P(Y_0=1)}{P(Y_1=1)} = 1 - \\frac{P(Y_0=1)}{P(Y_1=1)}$$\nThe causal risk ratio, $RR_{causal}$, is defined as the ratio of the risk of the outcome if everyone were exposed to the risk if everyone were unexposed:\n$$RR_{causal} = \\frac{P(Y_1=1)}{P(Y_0=1)}$$\nTherefore, the relationship between $PN$ and $RR_{causal}$ is:\n$$PN = 1 - \\frac{1}{RR_{causal}} = \\frac{RR_{causal} - 1}{RR_{causal}}$$\nThis expression links the probability that the exposure was a necessary cause for an individual's outcome, given they had the outcome and were exposed, to the causal risk ratio in the population.\n\nThe second part of the task is to determine what change in the true causal risk ratio would make necessity unsubstantiated, i.e., force $PN$ to $0$. From the derived formula, $PN = \\frac{RR_{causal} - 1}{RR_{causal}}$, it is clear that $PN = 0$ if and only if the numerator is zero (assuming $RR_{causal}$ is not zero). This occurs when:\n$$RR_{causal} - 1 = 0 \\implies RR_{causal} = 1$$\nA causal risk ratio of $1$ signifies no causal effect of the exposure on the outcome. Thus, necessity is unsubstantiated if there is no causal effect, which is logically consistent. The problem of unmeasured confounding arises because the observed risk ratio, $RR_{obs} = 2.5$, may not be equal to the true causal risk ratio, $RR_{causal}$.\n\nThe third and fourth parts require using the E-value to quantify the potential impact of an unmeasured confounder. The E-value is defined as the minimum strength of association, on the risk ratio scale, that an unmeasured confounder must have with both the exposure and the outcome to explain away the observed association, i.e., to reduce the estimate to the null. In this context, \"explaining away the association\" means reducing the true causal risk ratio to $RR_{causal} = 1$. As shown above, this is the condition that eliminates necessity ($PN=0$).\n\nFor an observed risk ratio $RR > 1$, the E-value is calculated by the formula:\n$$E = RR + \\sqrt{RR(RR-1)}$$\nUsing the given observed risk ratio, $RR = 2.5$, we compute the E-value:\n$$E = 2.5 + \\sqrt{2.5(2.5-1)} = 2.5 + \\sqrt{2.5 \\times 1.5} = 2.5 + \\sqrt{3.75}$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\\sqrt{3.75} \\approx 1.93649167$$\n$$E \\approx 2.5 + 1.93649167 = 4.43649167$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $4.436$.\n\nFinally, the fifth part asks for an interpretation of a reported E-value of $3.0$ for the observed $RR=2.5$. The E-value quantifies the robustness of an association to unmeasured confounding. An E-value of $3.0$ means that to fully explain away the observed risk ratio of $2.5$ — that is, to shift the true causal risk ratio to $1.0$ and thereby render any claim of necessity void — an unmeasured confounder would need to be associated with both the exposure and the outcome with risk ratios of at least $3.0$ each, conditional on the measured covariates. A single confounder with weaker associations with either the exposure or the outcome could not, on its own, be sufficient to explain the observed effect. This provides a threshold for clinicians and researchers to consider; they must judge whether an unmeasured confounder with such strong associations is plausible in the context of their study.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4.436}\n$$", "id": "4613529"}]}
