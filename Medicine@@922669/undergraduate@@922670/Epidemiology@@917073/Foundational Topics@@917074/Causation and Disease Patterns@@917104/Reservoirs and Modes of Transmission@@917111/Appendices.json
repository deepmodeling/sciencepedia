A human enteric virus is shed into the reservoir by infectious individuals living adjacent to the facility.

We can therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the concentration dynamics of a virus in a well-mixed reservoir, followed by the calculation of the steady-state concentration. The derivation begins from the mass balance principle.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) for Viral Concentration**\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the amount of virus in the reservoir is the mass balance equation, which states that the rate of change of the total viral mass, $M(t)$, is equal to the rate of viral input minus the rate of viral loss.\n$$\n\\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of Input}) - (\\text{Rate of Loss})\n$$\nThe problem provides the following terms:\n- The total rate of viral input is from $I(t)$ infectious individuals, each shedding at a per-capita rate of $\\sigma$. Thus, the total input rate is $\\sigma I(t)$.\n- The viral loss is due to first-order decay with a rate constant $\\delta$. This means the loss rate is proportional to the total mass of virus present, $M(t)$. Thus, the rate of loss is $\\delta M(t)$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the mass balance equation gives the ODE for the total viral mass $M(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = \\sigma I(t) - \\delta M(t)\n$$\nThe problem requires an ODE for the concentration, $C(t)$, which is defined as $C(t) = M(t)/V$, where $V$ is the constant volume of the reservoir. From this definition, we can express the mass as $M(t) = V \\cdot C(t)$.\n\nTo find the time derivative of $M(t)$ in terms of $C(t)$, we differentiate this relationship with respect to time $t$. Since $V$ is a constant, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} [V \\cdot C(t)] = V \\frac{dC(t)}{dt}\n$$\nNow, we substitute both $M(t) = V C(t)$ and its derivative into the mass balance ODE:\n$$\nV \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = \\sigma I(t) - \\delta (V C(t))\n$$\nTo obtain the final form of the ODE for $C(t)$, we divide the entire equation by the constant volume $V$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = \\frac{\\sigma I(t)}{V} - \\delta C(t)\n$$\nThis is the ordinary differential equation for the viral concentration $C(t)$ in terms of the given parameters $\\sigma$, $I(t)$, $V$, and $\\delta$.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Steady-State Concentration**\n\nA steady state is a condition where the state variables of the system no longer change with time. For the viral concentration, this means that the concentration $C(t)$ becomes constant. We denote this steady-state concentration as $C^{*}$. Mathematically, the condition for a steady state is:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = 0\n$$\nThe problem also states that for the analysis of the steady state, the number of infectious individuals is a constant, $I(t) = I^{*}$. Applying these conditions to the derived ODE:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{\\sigma I^{*}}{V} - \\delta C^{*}\n$$\nWe can now solve this algebraic equation for the steady-state concentration $C^{*}$:\n$$\n\\delta C^{*} = \\frac{\\sigma I^{*}}{V}\n$$\nIsolating $C^{*}$ yields the analytical expression for the steady-state concentration:\n$$\nC^{*} = \\frac{\\sigma I^{*}}{\\delta V}\n$$\n\n**3. Numerical Evaluation of the Steady-State Concentration**\n\nThe final task is to compute a numerical value for $C^{*}$ using the provided parameter values:\n- Volume of the reservoir, $V = 2.0 \\times 10^{6}$ liters.\n- Per-capita viral shedding rate, $\\sigma = 3.0 \\times 10^{10}$ genome copies per person per day.\n- Viral decay rate constant, $\\delta = 0.30$ day$^{-1}$.\n- Number of infectious individuals, $I^{*} = 12$ persons.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $C^{*}$:\n$$\nC^{*} = \\frac{(3.0 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ gc} \\cdot \\text{person}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{day}^{-1}) \\times (12 \\text{ persons})}{(0.30 \\text{ day}^{-1}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ L})}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the numerator and the denominator separately.\nNumerator:\n$$\n(3.0 \\times 10^{10}) \\times 12 = 36 \\times 10^{10} = 3.6 \\times 10^{11} \\text{ gc} \\cdot \\text{day}^{-1}\n$$\nDenominator:\n$$\n(0.30) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{6}) = 0.60 \\times 10^{6} = 6.0 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ L} \\cdot \\text{day}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, we perform the division:\n$$\nC^{*} = \\frac{3.6 \\times 10^{11}}{6.0 \\times 10^{5}} \\frac{\\text{gc} \\cdot \\text{day}^{-1}}{\\text{L} \\cdot \\text{day}^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nC^{*} = (\\frac{3.6}{6.0}) \\times 10^{(11-5)} \\frac{\\text{gc}}{\\text{L}}\n$$\n$$\nC^{*} = 0.6 \\times 10^{6} \\frac{\\text{gc}}{\\text{L}}\n$$\nExpressing this in standard scientific notation gives:\n$$\nC^{*} = 6.0 \\times 10^{5} \\frac{\\text{gc}}{\\text{L}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final numerical result to be rounded to three significant figures.

Assume an exponential single-hit dose-response mechanism rooted in the following fundamental principles: the number of successful infection-initiating events is modeled as a Poisson process when many independent rare opportunities for initiation are present; each infectious particle acts independently with a per-particle success probability; and the dose is the product of concentration and volume delivered.

The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\nThe problem requires the calculation of the infection risk, defined as the probability of at least one successful infection-initiating event. The derivation proceeds from the fundamental principles provided.\n\nFirst, we determine the dose, $D$, which is the total number of infectious particles transferred to the second person. The problem states that the dose is the product of the concentration of infectious particles, $L$, and the volume of blood delivered, $v$.\n$$\nD = L \\times v\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nD = (6.5 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ mL}^{-1}) \\times (1.8 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ mL}) = 1170\n$$\nSo, the inoculum contains $1170$ infectious particles.\n\nNext, we consider the process of infection initiation. Each of the $D$ particles acts independently with a per-particle probability of successfully causing an infection, $r$. The number of successful infection-initiating events, let's call this random variable $X$, can be precisely described by a binomial distribution with $D$ trials and success probability $r$, i.e., $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(D, r)$.\n\nHowever, the problem statement explicitly directs that \"the number of successful infection-initiating events is modeled as a Poisson process\". This is a common and valid approximation to the binomial distribution when the number of trials ($D$) is large and the probability of success ($r$) is small. The mean of the Poisson distribution, $\\lambda$, is set equal to the mean of the binomial distribution, which is the product of the number of trials and the success probability.\n$$\n\\lambda = E[X] = D \\times r = (L \\times v) \\times r\n$$\nThis parameter $\\lambda$ represents the mean or expected number of successful infection-initiating events for a given exposure.\n\nNow, we calculate the value of $\\lambda$ using the provided constants:\n$$\n\\lambda = (6.5 \\times 10^{5}) \\times (1.8 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (1.9 \\times 10^{-4})\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda = (6.5 \\times 1.8 \\times 1.9) \\times 10^{5-3-4} = 22.23 \\times 10^{-2} = 0.2223\n$$\n\nThe probability of observing exactly $k$ successful events, according to the Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$, is given by the probability mass function:\n$$\nP(X=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}\n$$\nThe infection risk, $P_{\\text{inf}}$, is defined as the probability of at least one successful event, which is $P(X \\ge 1)$. It is more direct to calculate the complementary probability, the probability of zero successful events, $P(X=0)$, and subtract it from $1$.\n$$\nP_{\\text{inf}} = P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X=0)\n$$\nUsing the Poisson probability mass function for $k=0$:\n$$\nP(X=0) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{0!} = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\exp(-\\lambda)}{1} = \\exp(-\\lambda)\n$$\nTherefore, the infection risk is given by the formula for the exponential single-hit model:\n$$\nP_{\\text{inf}} = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda) = 1 - \\exp(-Lvr)\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated value of $\\lambda = 0.2223$:\n$$\nP_{\\text{inf}} = 1 - \\exp(-0.2223)\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\exp(-0.2223) \\approx 0.8006846\n$$\n$$\nP_{\\text{inf}} \\approx 1 - 0.8006846 = 0.1993154\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
