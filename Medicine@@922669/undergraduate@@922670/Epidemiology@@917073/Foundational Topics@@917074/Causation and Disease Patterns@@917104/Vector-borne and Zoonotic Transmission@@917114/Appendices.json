Assume a homogeneous environment with two host classes only: humans and the wildlife reservoir. Each vector takes $a$ bites per vector per day, survives day-to-day with probability $s$, and requires $n$ days of extrinsic incubation before it becomes infectious after acquiring the pathogen. On any bite, the vector chooses a human with probability $p_{h}$ and a reservoir host with probability $p_{r}$, with $p_{h}+p_{r}=1$. Let $m$ denote vectors per human, $b_{vh}$ the per-bite transmission probability from an infectious vector to a human, $b_{vr}$ the per-bite probability that a susceptible vector acquires infection from an infectious reservoir host, and $\\pi_{r}$ the prevalence of infectious hosts in the reservoir.\n\nUse only the following foundational facts to build your derivation:\n1.

We assume the vector population is at a steady state. In this state, the rate at which vectors enter the infectious class must equal the rate at which they leave it (i.e., by dying).\n\nThe rate of entry into the infectious class depends on the incidence of new infections in susceptible vectors and their survival through the extrinsic incubation period. A single susceptible vector is infected at a rate equal to its biting rate on the infectious reservoir, $a p_r$, multiplied by the prevalence of infection in the reservoir, $\\pi_r$, and the probability of pathogen acquisition per bite, $b_{vr}$.

For a newly infected vector to become infectious, it must survive the EIP of $n$ days, which occurs with probability $s^n$ (from Foundational Fact 3). The rate of inflow into the infectious proportion of the vector population per day is therefore $(a p_r \\pi_r b_{vr}) s^n$.\n\nThe rate of outflow from the infectious class is due to vector mortality.
