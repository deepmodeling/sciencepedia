They adopt the following operational definition, built from core epidemiologic taxonomy and well-tested aerosol physics facts:\n\n- Direct transmission is defined as source-to-susceptible transfer that occurs without a persistent intermediary environment, either via physical person-to-person contact (e.g., skin-to-skin or mucosa-to-mucosa) or via short-range ballistic droplets that deposit on the susceptible host within a straight-line source-to-susceptible separation less than $1 \\ \\mathrm{m}$ and within $5 \\ \\mathrm{s}$ of emission.\n- Indirect transmission is defined as transfer mediated by an environmental or vector intermediary that decouples source and susceptible in space (greater than $1 \\ \\mathrm{m}$) or time (greater than $5 \\ \\mathrm{s}$), including air as a carrier of droplet nuclei that remain suspended for minutes, inanimate surfaces (fomites), water, food, or arthropod vectors.\n\nConsider the five scenarios below.

The taxonomic base recognized in epidemiology is that direct transmission involves immediate person-to-person transfer without a persistent intermediary environment, through physical contact or via short-range, large, ballistic droplets. Indirect transmission involves environmental or vector intermediaries, such as air as a vehicle for droplet nuclei that remain suspended for longer than a brief moment, inanimate objects (fomites), water, food, or arthropods.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and provides all necessary information. We may proceed with a solution.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation and Calculation of Infection Probability $P$\n\nThe analysis begins with the mass-balance principle for the concentration of infectious quanta, $C(t)$, in a well-mixed volume $V$. The rate of change of the number of quanta in the room, $V \\frac{dC}{dt}$, is equal to the rate of generation minus the rate of removal.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the Mass-Balance Equation**\nAn infectious individual ($I=1$) generates quanta at a rate $q$. The removal of quanta is due to ventilation at a volumetric rate $Q$. The concentration of quanta being removed is $C(t)$. Therefore, the mass-balance ordinary differential equation (ODE) is:\n$$V \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = I q - Q C(t)$$\nGiven $I=1$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$V \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = q - Q C(t)$$\nRearranging into standard linear first-order form:\n$$\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} + \\frac{Q}{V} C(t) = \\frac{q}{V}$$\nWe assume the room is initially free of quanta, so the initial condition is $C(0)=0$. The term $\\frac{Q}{V}$ is the air exchange rate, often denoted by $\\lambda$.\n\n**Step 2: Solve the ODE for Quanta Concentration $C(t)$**\nThis is a linear first-order ODE. We can solve it using an integrating factor, $\\mu(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int \\frac{Q}{V} dt\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{Q}{V}t\\right)$.\nMultiplying the ODE by $\\mu(t)$:\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{Q}{V}t\\right)\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} + \\frac{Q}{V}\\exp\\left(\\frac{Q}{V}t\\right)C(t) = \\frac{q}{V}\\exp\\left(\\frac{Q}{V}t\\right)$$\nThe left side is the derivative of a product:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\left[C(t)\\exp\\left(\\frac{Q}{V}t\\right)\\right] = \\frac{q}{V}\\exp\\left(\\frac{Q}{V}t\\right)$$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$:\n$$C(t)\\exp\\left(\\frac{Q}{V}t\\right) = \\int \\frac{q}{V}\\exp\\left(\\frac{Q}{V}t\\right) dt = \\frac{q}{V} \\left(\\frac{V}{Q}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{Q}{V}t\\right) + K$$\n$$C(t)\\exp\\left(\\frac{Q}{V}t\\right) = \\frac{q}{Q} \\exp\\left(\\frac{Q}{V}t\\right) + K$$\nSolving for $C(t)$:\n$$C(t) = \\frac{q}{Q} + K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{V}t\\right)$$\nUsing the initial condition $C(0)=0$:\n$$0 = \\frac{q}{Q} + K \\exp(0) \\implies K = -\\frac{q}{Q}$$\nSubstituting $K$ back, we get the time-dependent concentration of infectious quanta:\n$$C(t) = \\frac{q}{Q} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{V}t\\right)\\right)$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inhaled Dose $N$**\nA susceptible individual inhales air at a volumetric rate $p$ for a duration $t$. The total number of inhaled quanta, $N$, is the integral of the instantaneous inhalation rate, $p C(\\tau)$, over the exposure period from $\\tau=0$ to $\\tau=t$.\n$$N = \\int_{0}^{t} p C(\\tau) d\\tau = \\int_{0}^{t} p \\frac{q}{Q} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{V}\\tau\\right)\\right) d\\tau$$\n$$N = \\frac{pq}{Q} \\int_{0}^{t} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{V}\\tau\\right)\\right) d\\tau$$\n$$N = \\frac{pq}{Q} \\left[ \\tau - \\left(-\\frac{V}{Q}\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{V}\\tau\\right) \\right]_{0}^{t}$$\n$$N = \\frac{pq}{Q} \\left[ \\left(t + \\frac{V}{Q}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{V}t\\right)\\right) - \\left(0 + \\frac{V}{Q}\\exp(0)\\right) \\right]$$\n$$N = \\frac{pq}{Q} \\left(t + \\frac{V}{Q}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{V}t\\right) - \\frac{V}{Q}\\right)$$\nThis gives the analytical expression for the mean number of inhaled quanta:\n$$N = \\frac{pq}{Q} \\left(t - \\frac{V}{Q}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{V}t\\right)\\right)\\right)$$\n\n**Step 4: Derive the Infection Probability $P$**\nThe problem specifies a Poisson infection process. The probability of inhaling exactly $k$ quanta is given by the Poisson distribution $P(k) = \\frac{N^k e^{-N}}{k!}$, where $N$ is the mean number of inhaled quanta. Infection occurs if one or more quanta are inhaled ($k \\geq 1$). The probability of this is $1$ minus the probability of inhaling zero quanta ($k=0$):\n$$P = 1 - P(k=0) = 1 - \\frac{N^0 e^{-N}}{0!} = 1 - e^{-N}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $N$, we obtain the analytical expression for the infection probability $P$:\n$$P(Q) = 1 - \\exp\\left[ -\\frac{pq}{Q} \\left(t - \\frac{V}{Q}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Qt}{V}\\right)\\right)\\right) \\right]$$\n\n**Step 5: Compute the numerical value of $P$**\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n$V=200\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}$, $Q=600\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}/\\mathrm{h}$, $I=1$, $q=50\\,\\text{quanta}/\\mathrm{h}$, $p=0.5\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}/\\mathrm{h}$, $t=2\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the mean dose $N$:\nThe air exchange rate is $\\frac{Q}{V} = \\frac{600\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}/\\mathrm{h}}{200\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}} = 3\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\nThe dimensionless group $\\frac{Qt}{V} = \\frac{600 \\cdot 2}{200} = 6$.\n$$N = \\frac{0.5 \\cdot 50}{600} \\left(2 - \\frac{200}{600}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{600 \\cdot 2}{200}\\right)\\right)\\right)$$\n$$N = \\frac{25}{600} \\left(2 - \\frac{1}{3}\\left(1 - \\exp(-6)\\right)\\right) = \\frac{1}{24} \\left(2 - \\frac{1}{3}\\left(1 - \\exp(-6)\\right)\\right)$$\n$$N \\approx \\frac{1}{24} \\left(2 - \\frac{1}{3}(1 - 0.00247875)\\right) = \\frac{1}{24} \\left(2 - \\frac{0.99752125}{3}\\right)$$\n$$N \\approx \\frac{1}{24} (2 - 0.33250708) = \\frac{1.66749292}{24} \\approx 0.06947887$$\nNow, calculate $P$:\n$$P = 1 - e^{-N} \\approx 1 - \\exp(-0.06947887) \\approx 1 - 0.9328796 = 0.0671204$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $P \\approx 0.06712$.\n\n### Part 2: Derivation and Calculation of Elasticity $\\mathcal{E}_{Q}$\n\n**Step 1: Derive the analytical expression for $\\mathcal{E}_{Q}$**\nThe elasticity of $P$ with respect to $Q$ is defined as $\\mathcal{E}_{Q}=\\left(\\frac{dP}{dQ}\\right)\\left(\\frac{Q}{P}\\right)$.\nFirst, we find $\\frac{dP}{dQ}$ using the chain rule:\n$$P = 1 - e^{-N(Q)} \\implies \\frac{dP}{dQ} = -e^{-N(Q)} \\left(-\\frac{dN}{dQ}\\right) = e^{-N} \\frac{dN}{dQ}$$\nSubstituting this into the elasticity definition:\n$$\\mathcal{E}_{Q} = \\left(e^{-N} \\frac{dN}{dQ}\\right) \\left(\\frac{Q}{1-e^{-N}}\\right) = \\frac{Q e^{-N}}{1 - e^{-N}} \\frac{dN}{dQ}$$\nNext, we must find $\\frac{dN}{dQ}$.
