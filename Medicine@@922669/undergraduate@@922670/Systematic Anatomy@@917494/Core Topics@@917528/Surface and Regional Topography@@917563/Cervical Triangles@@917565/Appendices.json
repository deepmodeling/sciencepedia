[@problem_id:5097451]", "problem": "In the lateral cervical region, the anterior scalene muscle contributes to the floor of the posterior triangle. The phrenic nerve descends on the anterior surface of the anterior scalene within the prevertebral fascia and passes posterior to the subclavian vein en route to the thorax. For a percutaneous procedure that targets the interscalene interval, a practical safety principle is to confine needle entry to a circular “safe zone” centered on a reliably identified point on the lateral border of the anterior scalene, chosen at a known vertical distance above the clavicle, so that the needle path remains lateral to the nerve by a minimal clearance.\n\nAssume the following anatomical model is supported by pooled cadaveric and imaging data in the lower neck: the mediolateral separation between the phrenic nerve and the lateral border of the anterior scalene at a vertical height $x$ above the clavicle is well-approximated by a linear function\n$$\nd(x) = \\alpha + \\beta x,\n$$\nwhere $d(x)$ is measured in $\\mathrm{mm}$ and $x$ in $\\mathrm{mm}$, with $\\alpha = 5.8$ and $\\beta = 0.12$.

To ensure safety, a minimal anatomical clearance of $c = 3.0 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ from the phrenic nerve is required.

I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to calculate the \"safe zone radius,\" $r_{\\mathrm{safe}}$. This radius defines a circular area on the skin, centered on the identified lateral border of the anterior scalene muscle. By definition, any needle entry point within this circle must maintain a minimum clearance of $c$ from the phrenic nerve, even under worst-case conditions.\n\nThe problem is essentially one-dimensional in the mediolateral plane at the specified vertical height $x_0$. Let us define the position of the phrenic nerve as the origin, $p_{\\mathrm{nerve}} = 0$. The lateral border of the anterior scalene muscle is, therefore, at a position $p_{\\mathrm{muscle}} = d(x_0)$. The needle is inserted relative to an *identified* position of the muscle border, not its true position.\n\nThe true anatomical separation between the nerve and the muscle border at the height $x_{0} = 25 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ is given by the function $d(x)$:\n$$\nd(x_0) = \\alpha + \\beta x_0\n$$\nSubstituting the given values, $\\alpha = 5.8$ and $\\beta = 0.12$:\n$$\nd(25) = 5.8 + (0.12)(25) = 5.8 + 3.0 = 8.8 \\ \\mathrm{mm}\n$$\nThis value, $d(x_0)$, represents the total available distance or \"safety budget\" between the true positions of the nerve and the muscle's lateral border.\n\nThis budget must accommodate three components in a worst-case scenario:\n1.  The desired minimal clearance, $c$.\n2.  The maximum possible offset of the needle entry point from the center of the safe zone, which is the radius $r_{\\mathrm{safe}}$. The worst case occurs when the needle is inserted at the medialmost edge of the circular safe zone, bringing it closer to the nerve by a distance of $r_{\\mathrm{safe}}$.\n3.  The total uncertainty in localization, $e_{\\mathrm{total}}$. This uncertainty effectively reduces the known separation between the needle and the nerve. The problem states that the localization and motion errors are additive in the worst case.\n    $$\n    e_{\\mathrm{total}} = e_{\\mathrm{loc}} + e_{\\mathrm{motion}}\n    $$\n    Substituting the given values, $e_{\\mathrm{loc}} = 1.5 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and $e_{\\mathrm{motion}} = 0.7 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$:\n    $$\n    e_{\\mathrm{total}} = 1.5 + 0.7 = 2.2 \\ \\mathrm{mm}\n    $$\n\nTo find the largest possible safe radius, $r_{\\mathrm{safe}}$, we set up an equation where the total available separation is exactly consumed by the sum of these three components. The true separation, $d(x_0)$, must be equal to the sum of the radius of the safe zone, the total error, and the required clearance.\n$$\nd(x_0) = r_{\\mathrm{safe}} + e_{\\mathrm{total}} + c\n$$\nThis equation ensures that in the worst case (where the needle is inserted at the medial edge of the safe zone and all uncertainties conspire to reduce the distance), the final clearance to the nerve is exactly $c$.\n\nWe can now solve for $r_{\\mathrm{safe}}$:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{safe}} = d(x_0) - e_{\\mathrm{total}} - c\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $d(x_0)$ and $e_{\\mathrm{total}}$, and the given value for $c = 3.0 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{safe}} = 8.8 \\ \\mathrm{mm} - 2.2 \\ \\mathrm{mm} - 3.0 \\ \\mathrm{mm}\n$$\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{safe}} = 3.6 \\ \\mathrm{mm}\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $3.6$ has two significant figures. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $3.60$.\n\nThe final symbolic expression for the safe radius is:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{safe}} = (\\alpha + \\beta x_0) - (e_{\\mathrm{loc}} + e_{\\mathrm{motion}}) - c\n$$\nThe final numerical computation is:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{safe}} = (5.8 + 0.12 \\times 25) - (1.5 + 0.7) - 3.0 = 8.8 - 2.2 - 3.0 = 3.60 \\ \\mathrm{mm}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.60}$$", "id": "5097451"}, {"introduction": "Once a safe entry region has been determined, the clinician must plan a precise path to the target.

Let the skin entry point be the origin, $(0, 0)$. Let the positive x-axis point laterally along the skin surface, and the positive y-axis point downwards, representing depth.\n\n1.  **Define Coordinates of Key Points**\n    -   **Skin Entry Point ($P_{entry}$)**: As the origin of our coordinate system, its coordinates are $(0, 0)$.\n    -   **IJV Center ($C_{IJV}$)**: The center is at a depth of $D_{center} = 1.8$ cm and a horizontal distance of $H_{center} = 1.2$ cm laterally. In our coordinate system, its coordinates are $(H_{center}, D_{center}) = (1.2, 1.8)$. All units are in cm.\n    -   **Target Point ($P_{target}$)**: The target is the \"lateral one-third point across the IJV lumen\". The IJV has a diameter $d = 1.2$ cm, so its radius is $r = d/2 = 0.6$ cm. The horizontal extent of the IJV lumen, passing through its center, is from $x = H_{center} - r$ to $x = H_{center} + r$. To \"bias away from the carotid artery\" (which is medial), the target must be lateral to the IJV's center. We interpret \"lateral one-third point\" as the point that divides the vessel's diameter into a medial two-thirds and a lateral one-third. This point is located a distance of $\\frac{2}{3}d$ from the medial edge of the lumen.\n    \n    The x-coordinate of the medial edge of the IJV is $x_{medial} = H_{center} - r$.\n    The x-coordinate of the target, $x_{target}$, is therefore:\n    $$x_{target} = x_{medial} + \\frac{2}{3}d = (H_{center} - r) + \\frac{2}{3}(2r) = H_{center} - r + \\frac{4}{3}r = H_{center} + \\frac{1}{3}r$$\n    The target point lies on the horizontal line passing through the IJV center, so its depth is the same as the center's depth, $y_{target} = D_{center}$.\n    Thus, the coordinates of the target point are $P_{target} = (H_{center} + \\frac{1}{3}r, D_{center})$.\n\n2.  **Construct the Right Triangle**\n    The needle path is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with vertices at the entry point $P_{entry}$, the target point $P_{target}$, and the point on the skin surface directly above the target.\n    -   **Horizontal Leg ($L_h$)**: This is the lateral distance from the entry point to the target point.\n        $$L_h = x_{target} - 0 = H_{center} + \\frac{1}{3}r = H_{center} + \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right) = H_{center} + \\frac{d}{6}$$\n    -   **Vertical Leg ($L_v$)**: This is the depth of the target point.\n        $$L_v = y_{target} - 0 = D_{center}$$\n\n3.  **Derive Angle and Path Length**\n    -   **Insertion Angle ($\\theta$)**: The angle is measured relative to the skin surface (the horizontal axis). From the definition of the tangent function:\n        $$\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}} = \\frac{L_v}{L_h} = \\frac{D_{center}}{H_{center} + \\frac{d}{6}}$$\n        Therefore, the angle is:\n        $$\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{D_{center}}{H_{center} + \\frac{d}{6}}\\right)$$\n    -   **Needle Path Length ($L$)**: The path length is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.
