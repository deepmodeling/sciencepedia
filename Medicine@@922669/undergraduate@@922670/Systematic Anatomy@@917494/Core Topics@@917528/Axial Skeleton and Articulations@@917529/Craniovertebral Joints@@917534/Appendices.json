The model of summing segmental rotations is a standard and valid simplification in kinematics. The anatomical definitions are correct. The stated values for total rotation (approximately $80^{\\circ}-90^{\\circ}$ is normal), the negligible contribution of the atlanto-occipital joint ($C_0-C_1$) to axial rotation, and the substantial contribution of both the atlanto-axial ($C_1-C_2$) and subaxial ($C_2-C_7$) spine are all consistent with clinical and biomechanical literature.

Using the core definitions that torque about a specified axis is the projection of the moment vector onto that axis and that the moment arm is the perpendicular distance from the axis to the line of action of the force, you will map the rectus capitis posterior major and the obliquus capitis inferior to the craniovertebral joints they primarily act upon and compute their axial-rotation moment arms.\n\nAssume the following scientifically plausible geometric model based on adult anatomy. Establish a right-handed coordinate system with the origin at the center of the odontoid process (dens) at the level of the atlas ring, with the $z$-axis ($\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_{z}$) aligned superiorly along the dens (the axial rotation axis), the $x$-axis to the subject’s right, and the $y$-axis anteriorly.

This involves a brief anatomical justification followed by vector calculations based on a provided geometric model. All coordinates are in centimeters.\n\nFirst, the anatomical justification for the muscles' action. Axial rotation of the head (the \"no\" motion) primarily occurs at the atlanto-axial joint, which is the articulation between the first cervical vertebra ($C_1$, atlas) and the second cervical vertebra ($C_2$, axis). This joint is a pivot joint, with the dens of the axis serving as the pivot around which the atlas rotates. The skull (occiput, $C_0$) is firmly bound to the atlas and rotates with it as a single unit. Therefore, muscles that produce axial rotation at the atlanto-axial joint must connect the $C_1$/$C_0$ unit to the $C_2$ vertebra.\n1.  **Rectus capitis posterior major (RCPM)**: This muscle originates from the spinous process of the axis ($C_2$) and inserts on the occipital bone ($C_0$). By spanning from $C_2$ to $C_0$, it crosses the atlanto-axial joint. When it contracts, it pulls the occiput posteriorly and medially, contributing to ipsilateral axial rotation of the head.\n2.  **Obliquus capitis inferior (OCI)**: This muscle originates from the spinous process of the axis ($C_2$) and inserts on the transverse process of the atlas ($C_1$). It is unique in that it is the only suboccipital muscle that does not attach to the skull. By spanning from $C_2$ to $C_1$, it acts exclusively on the atlanto-axial joint and is the most powerful primary mover for ipsilateral axial rotation of this joint.\n\nBoth muscles are correctly identified as effectors of axial rotation at the atlanto-axial joint. The problem specifies modeling this rotation as motion about the $z$-axis, which is consistent with the anatomy of the dens.\n\nThe moment arm, $m$, for axial rotation is defined as the magnitude of the axial torque per unit force. The axial torque about the $z$-axis ($\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_{z}$) generated by a force $\\mathbf{F}$ applied at position $\\mathbf{I}$ is $\\tau_z = \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_{z} \\cdot (\\mathbf{I} \\times \\mathbf{F})$. The force vector is given by $\\mathbf{F} = F \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$, where $F$ is the magnitude of the force and $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$ is the unit vector along the muscle's line of action. The line of action is directed from the insertion point $\\mathbf{I}$ to the origin point $\\mathbf{O}$. The direction vector is $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{O} - \\mathbf{I}$, and the unit vector is $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = \\mathbf{v} / |\\mathbf{v}|$.\n\nSubstituting $\\mathbf{F}$ into the torque equation gives $\\tau_z = \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_{z} \\cdot (\\mathbf{I} \\times (F\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})) = F (\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_{z} \\cdot (\\mathbf{I} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}))$.\nThe moment arm is then $m = |\\frac{\\tau_z}{F}| = |\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_{z} \\cdot (\\mathbf{I} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{n}})|$.\nThe scalar triple product can be calculated using a determinant. Let $\\mathbf{I} = (I_x, I_y, I_z)$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$.\n$$m = \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_{z} \\\\ \\mathbf{I} \\\\ \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} \\end{pmatrix} \\right| = \\left| \\begin{vmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ I_x & I_y & I_z \\\\ n_x & n_y & n_z \\end{vmatrix} \\right| = |I_x n_y - I_y n_x|$$\nSince $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = \\mathbf{v} / |\\mathbf{v}|$, where $\\mathbf{v} = (v_x, v_y, v_z)$, this can be written as:\n$$m = \\frac{|I_x v_y - I_y v_x|}{|\\mathbf{v}|}$$\nWe will apply this formula to each muscle.\n\n**1.
