The radius of the foramen cecum, $r$, is half of its diameter, $d$:\n$$\nr = \\frac{d}{2}\n$$\nThe cross-sectional area of the foramen, $A$, assuming a circular shape, is given by:\n$$\nA = \\pi r^2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}\n$$\nNext, we determine the area required, $A_{\\text{req}}$.

The radius of the vein, $r_v$, is half of its diameter, $d_v$:\n$$\nr_v = \\frac{d_v}{2}\n$$\nThe clearance annulus has a uniform thickness, $c$. Therefore, the total radius required to accommodate both the vein and its clearance, $r_{\\text{req}}$, is the sum of the vein's radius and the clearance thickness:\n$$\nr_{\\text{req}} = r_v + c = \\frac{d_v}{2} + c\n$$\nThe minimum area required, $A_{\\text{req}}$, is the area of a circle with this total radius:\n$$\nA_{\\text{req}} = \\pi (r_{\\text{req}})^2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d_v}{2} + c\\right)^2\n$$\nThe patency margin, $M$, is defined as $M = A - A_{\\text{req}}$.

This is associated with a more primitive hominid skull morphology, leading to a more prognathic (projecting) face and an elongated skull shape. This configuration tends to increase the anteroposterior dimension of the cranial base.\n\nA smaller angle indicates a more flexed cranial base. This flexion is a key derived trait of modern humans ($H.$ $sapiens$). It is associated with a shortened cranial base, an orthognathic (flatter) face, and a more globular, vertically expanded neurocranium. This flexion brings the foramen magnum into a more forward and inferior position, which is biomechanically advantageous for bipedal locomotion. A more flexed base effectively \"tucks\" the posterior fossa underneath the middle and anterior fossae, contributing to the characteristic high, rounded shape of the modern human skull.\n\nThe calculated value of $139.7^\\circ$ falls within the typical range for a modern adult human, which is approximately $125^\\circ$ to $143^\\circ$.
