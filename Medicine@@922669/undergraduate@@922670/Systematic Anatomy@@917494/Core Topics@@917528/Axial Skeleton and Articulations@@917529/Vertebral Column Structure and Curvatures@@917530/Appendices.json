The Cobb angle method is defined anatomically as follows: for a given curvature bounded by an upper vertebra and a lower vertebra, draw lines along the superior endplate of the upper vertebra and the inferior endplate of the lower vertebra. The Cobb angle is the magnitude of the angle between those lines, which is equivalently computed as the absolute difference of their endplate inclinations with respect to a fixed horizontal axis. In this setup, endplate inclination is measured as the signed angle in degrees between the endplate line and the horizontal, with counterclockwise rotations defined as positive.\n\nGiven the following endplate inclination measurements (in degrees) on a standing lateral radiograph: cervical curvature bounded superiorly by the inferior endplate of the second cervical vertebra ($C2$) and inferiorly by the inferior endplate of the seventh cervical vertebra ($C7$), with $\\theta_{C2} = 5.0^{\\circ}$ and $\\theta_{C7} = -28.0^{\\circ}$; thoracic curvature bounded superiorly by the superior endplate of the first thoracic vertebra ($T1$) and inferiorly by the inferior endplate of the twelfth thoracic vertebra ($T12$), with $\\theta_{T1} = -8.0^{\\circ}$ and $\\theta_{T12} = 34.0^{\\circ}$; lumbar curvature bounded superiorly by the superior endplate of the first lumbar vertebra ($L1$) and inferiorly by the superior endplate of the first sacral vertebra ($S1$), with $\\theta_{L1} = 6.0^{\\circ}$ and $\\theta_{S1} = -44.0^{\\circ}$.\n\nEach endplate inclination measurement carries a standard measurement uncertainty (one standard deviation) due to line placement and imaging factors: $u_{C2} = 0.8^{\\circ}$, $u_{C7} = 1.0^{\\circ}$; $u_{T1} = 0.9^{\\circ}$, $u_{T12} = 0.9^{\\circ}$; $u_{L1} = 0.7^{\\circ}$, $u_{S1} = 1.2^{\\circ}$.

Therefore, a complete solution can be derived.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the Sagittal Vertical Axis (SVA) in millimeters.

The horizontal distance in pixels, which we denote as $SVA_{\\text{pixel}}$, is the difference between the $x$-coordinate of the plumb line and the $x$-coordinate of the $S_1$ landmark.\n\nThe problem specifies the sign convention: SVA is positive when the C7 plumb line falls anterior to the S1 corner. Given that the image's $x$-axis increases anteriorly, \"anterior to\" corresponds to a larger $x$-coordinate. Thus, the SVA is positive if $x_{C7} > x_{S1}$.

The relationship between the arc's radius $R$, its central angle $\\theta$, and the sagitta $h$ is derived from first principles.\n\nConsider a circular arc of radius $R$ and central angle $\\theta$. The sagitta $h$ is the distance from the arc's midpoint to the midpoint of its chord. A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius $R$ (hypotenuse), half the chord length, and the line segment from the circle's center to the chord's midpoint (length $R-h$).
