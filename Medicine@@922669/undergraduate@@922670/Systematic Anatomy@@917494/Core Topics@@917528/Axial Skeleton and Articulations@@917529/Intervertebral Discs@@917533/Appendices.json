A solution will be derived as requested.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe Disc Height Index, denoted as $DHI$, is defined as the ratio of a representative disc height to a representative vertebral body diameter. The problem directs the use of the arithmetic mean as the method for determining these representative values.\n\nFirst, we define the representative disc height, $H_{\\text{rep}}$, as the arithmetic mean of the anterior disc height, $h_a$, and the posterior disc height, $h_p$.\n$$\nH_{\\text{rep}} = \\frac{h_a + h_p}{2}\n$$\n\nNext, we define the representative vertebral body diameter, $D_{\\text{ref}}$, which serves as the normalizing reference. It is the arithmetic mean of the sagittal anteroposterior diameter of the superior vertebral body, $d_s$, and that of the inferior vertebral body, $d_i$.\n$$\nD_{\\text{ref}} = \\frac{d_s + d_i}{2}\n$$\n\nThe $DHI$ is the ratio of these two representative values:\n$$\nDHI = \\frac{H_{\\text{rep}}}{D_{\\text{ref}}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $H_{\\text{rep}}$ and $D_{\\text{ref}}$ into the equation for $DHI$ yields:\n$$\nDHI = \\frac{\\frac{h_a + h_p}{2}}{\\frac{d_s + d_i}{2}}\n$$\n\nThis expression can be simplified by canceling the common factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ from the numerator and the denominator. This gives the final closed-form expression for the $DHI$:\n$$\nDHI = \\frac{h_a + h_p}{d_s + d_i}\n$$\nThis simplified form is intuitive: it is the ratio of the summed disc heights to the summed vertebral body diameters. The use of ratios automatically ensures the resulting index is dimensionless, as the units (mm in this case) in the numerator and denominator cancel out.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of the $DHI$ using the provided measurements: $h_{a} = 10.8$ mm, $h_{p} = 7.2$ mm, $d_{s} = 34.5$ mm, and $d_{i} = 35.5$ mm.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\nDHI = \\frac{10.8 + 7.2}{34.5 + 35.5}\n$$\n$$\nDHI = \\frac{18.0}{70.0}\n$$\n$$\nDHI = \\frac{18}{70} = \\frac{9}{35}\n$$\n\nTo provide the answer as a decimal, we perform the division:\n$$\nDHI \\approx 0.257142857...\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $2$, $5$, $7$, and $1$. The fifth digit is $4$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., we truncate at the fourth significant figure).\n$$\nDHI \\approx 0.2571\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2571}$$", "id": "5117939"}, {"introduction": "The intervertebral disc is not a static structure; it is a dynamic, living tissue that responds to the daily cycle of loading and unloading.

The intervertebral disc lies between adjacent vertebral bodies.\n2.  Each lumbar spinal nerve exits the vertebral canal through the intervertebral foramen below the pedicle of the same-numbered vertebra.\n3.

It is clearly structured to have a unique, stable, and meaningful solution derived from these axioms.\n3.  **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjectivity or ambiguity. Terms like \"posterolateral,\" \"lateral recess,\" and \"pedicle\" have universally accepted anatomical meanings. The problem defines \"traversing root\" for clarity.\n\n**Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-structured deductive reasoning question based on sound anatomical principles. I will now proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nLet us analyze the anatomical relationships at a generic lumbar intervertebral level, which we can denote as the $\\mathrm{L}n$–$\\mathrm{L}(n+1)$ level. The intervertebral disc at this level is the $\\mathrm{L}n$–$\\mathrm{L}(n+1)$ disc.\n\n1.  **The Exiting Nerve Root:** Based on the given rule \"each lumbar spinal nerve exits the vertebral canal through the intervertebral foramen below the pedicle of the same-numbered vertebra,\" the $\\mathrm{L}n$ spinal nerve exits below the pedicle of the $\\mathrm{L}n$ vertebra. The intervertebral foramen it passes through is formed by the inferior aspect of the $\\mathrm{L}n$ vertebra and the superior aspect of the $\\mathrm{L}(n+1)$ vertebra. Therefore, at the level of the $\\mathrm{L}n$–$\\mathrm{L}(n+1)$ disc, the $\\mathrm{L}n$ nerve root is the **exiting root**. To reach its foramen, this root must travel superior to the disc and laterally, under the $\\mathrm{L}n$ pedicle.\n\n2.  **The Traversing Nerve Root:** Based on the given rule, \"a root descending to exit at the next caudal level occupies the lateral recess medial to the foramen.\" At the $\\mathrm{L}n$–$\\mathrm{L}(n+1)$ disc level, the nerve root descending to exit at the next level (the $\\mathrm{L}(n+1)$–$\\mathrm{L}(n+2)$ foramen) is the $\\mathrm{L}(n+1)$ nerve root. This is the **traversing root**. It passes across the posterior aspect of the $\\mathrm{L}n$–$\\mathrm{L}(n+1)$ disc on its way down.\n\n3.  **Location of Herniation:** The problem states that a \"posterolateral herniation of the disc protrudes into the lateral recess.\"\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Combining these facts, a posterolateral herniation of the $\\mathrm{L}n$–$\\mathrm{L}(n+1)$ disc will protrude into the lateral recess at that level. The structure occupying the lateral recess at this level is the traversing $\\mathrm{L}(n+1)$ nerve root. The exiting $\\mathrm{L}n$ nerve root is located more superiorly and laterally, having already passed over the level of the disc to enter its foramen, and is therefore typically spared by a posterolateral herniation. The general rule is: **A posterolateral herniation at level $\\mathrm{L}n$–$\\mathrm{L}(n+1)$ affects the traversing $\\mathrm{L}(n+1)$ nerve root.**\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. At $\\mathrm{L}4$–$\\mathrm{L}5$, a posterolateral disc herniation typically compresses the traversing $\\mathrm{L}5$ nerve root because the exiting $\\mathrm{L}4$ root lies superior and lateral under the $\\mathrm{L}4$ pedicle.**\nApplying our derived general rule to the $\\mathrm{L}4$–$\\mathrm{L}5$ level (where $n=4$): a posterolateral herniation of the $\\mathrm{L}4$–$\\mathrm{L}5$ disc should affect the traversing $\\mathrm{L}(4+1) = \\mathrm{L}5$ nerve root. The statement claims this and correctly identifies the reason: the exiting $\\mathrm{L}4$ root is already superior and lateral, on its way out of the $\\mathrm{L}4$–$\\mathrm{L}5$ foramen. This statement is perfectly consistent with our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. At $\\mathrm{L}5$–$\\mathrm{S}1$, a posterolateral disc herniation typically compresses the exiting $\\mathrm{L}5$ root because the traversing $\\mathrm{S}1$ root has already left the canal.**\nApplying our rule to the $\\mathrm{L}5$–$\\mathrm{S}1$ level (where $n=5$): a posterolateral herniation of the $\\mathrm{L}5$–$\\mathrm{S}1$ disc should affect the traversing $\\mathrm{S}(5+1) = \\mathrm{S}1$ nerve root. This statement claims the herniation compresses the *exiting* $\\mathrm{L}5$ root, which contradicts our findings. The reason given—that the \"traversing $\\mathrm{S}1$ root has already left the canal\"—is factually incorrect. At the level of the $\\mathrm{L}5$–$\\mathrm{S}1$ disc, the $\\mathrm{S}1$ root is precisely the root traversing the disc to exit through the first sacral foramen.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Throughout the lumbar spine, posterolateral disc herniations most often injure the exiting root at the same level (for example, $\\mathrm{L}4$ at $\\mathrm{L}4$–$\\mathrm{L}5$).**\nThis is a general statement that claims the exiting root (e.g., $\\mathrm{L}n$) is affected at the $\\mathrm{L}n$–$\\mathrm{L}(n+1)$ level. Our derivation concluded the opposite: it is the traversing root ($\\mathrm{L}(n+1)$) that is typically affected. The example given ($\\mathrm{L}4$ at $\\mathrm{L}4$–$\\mathrm{L}5$) is incorrect, as established in the analysis of option A.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. At upper lumbar levels such as $\\mathrm{L}2$–$\\mathrm{L}3$, a posterolateral herniation impinges the traversing $\\mathrm{L}3$ root, not the exiting $\\mathrm{L}2$ root.**\nApplying our rule to the $\\mathrm{L}2$–$\\mathrm{L}3$ level (where $n=2$): a posterolateral herniation of the $\\mathrm{L}2$–$\\mathrm{L}3$ disc should affect the traversing $\\mathrm{L}(2+1) = \\mathrm{L}3$ nerve root. The exiting $\\mathrm{L}2$ root, being superior and lateral, should be spared. This statement accurately describes this exact relationship. It is consistent with our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. Only far-lateral (foraminal or extraforaminal) herniations compress the traversing root; posterolateral herniations spare it.**\nA far-lateral herniation would occur within or lateral to the intervertebral foramen. At the $\\mathrm{L}n$–$\\mathrm{L}(n+1)$ level, the structure exiting the foramen is the $\\mathrm{L}n$ root. Therefore, a far-lateral herniation affects the *exiting* root, not the traversing root. The second part of the statement, that posterolateral herniations spare the traversing root, is the direct opposite of our derived conclusion. This option misattributes the affected nerve root for both types of herniation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "AD", "id": "5118015"}]}
