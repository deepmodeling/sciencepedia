I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Hydraulic Resistance $R$**\n\nThe problem provides the definition of hydraulic resistance $R$ as:\n$$ \\Delta P = R\\,Q $$\nThe \"well-tested relationship\" for laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid through a straight, rigid cylinder of radius $r$ and length $L$ is the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which gives the volumetric flow rate $Q$ as:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L} $$\nwhere $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity and $\\Delta P$ is the pressure drop across the length $L$.\n\nTo find an expression for $R$, we rearrange the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to express $\\Delta P$ in terms of $Q$:\n$$ \\Delta P = \\left( \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4} \\right) Q $$\nBy comparing this equation directly with the definition $\\Delta P = R\\,Q$, we can identify the hydraulic resistance $R$ as:\n$$ R = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4} $$\nThis expression gives the hydraulic resistance in terms of the fluid viscosity $\\eta$ and the geometry of the tube ($L$ and $r$).\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Hydraulic Resistance $R$**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Radius: $r = 2 \\text{ mm}$\n- Length: $L = 25 \\text{ cm}$\n- Viscosity: $\\eta = 0.001 \\text{ Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}$\n\nTo calculate $R$ in the required SI units of $\\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s/m}^3$, we must first convert all given values to base SI units (meters, Pascal-seconds).\n- $r = 2 \\text{ mm} = 2 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m}$\n- $L = 25 \\text{ cm} = 0.25 \\text{ m}$\n- $\\eta = 0.001 \\text{ Pa}\\cdot\\text{s} = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the derived expression for $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{8 (1 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}) (0.25 \\text{ m})}{\\pi (2 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m})^4} $$\n$$ R = \\frac{8 \\times 0.25 \\times 10^{-3}}{\\pi (2^4 \\times (10^{-3})^4)} \\frac{\\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}\\cdot\\text{m}}{\\text{m}^4} $$\n$$ R = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-3}}{\\pi (16 \\times 10^{-12})} \\text{ Pa}\\cdot\\text{s/m}^3 $$\n$$ R = \\frac{2}{16\\pi} \\times 10^{-3 - (-12)} \\text{ Pa}\\cdot\\text{s/m}^3 $$\n$$ R = \\frac{1}{8\\pi} \\times 10^9 \\text{ Pa}\\cdot\\text{s/m}^3 $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ R \\approx \\frac{1}{8 \\times 3.14159265...} \\times 10^9 \\text{ Pa}\\cdot\\text{s/m}^3 $$\n$$ R \\approx 0.0397887... \\times 10^9 \\text{ Pa}\\cdot\\text{s/m}^3 $$\n$$ R \\approx 3.97887 \\times 10^7 \\text{ Pa}\\cdot\\text{s/m}^3 $$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ R \\approx 3.98 \\times 10^7 \\text{ Pa}\\cdot\\text{s/m}^3 $$\n\n**Part 3: Determination of the Flow-Change Factor**\n\nWe need to find the multiplicative factor by which the flow rate $Q$ changes if the radius is halved, i.e., $r_{\\text{new}} = r/2$, assuming the driving pressure $\\Delta P$ remains constant.\nLet the initial state be denoted by subscript $1$ and the final state by subscript $2$.\nThe flow rate is given by $Q = \\Delta P / R$.\nThe initial flow rate is $Q_1 = \\Delta P / R_1$.\nThe final flow rate is $Q_2 = \\Delta P / R_2$.\nThe multiplicative factor is the ratio $Q_2/Q_1$:\n$$ \\frac{Q_2}{Q_1} = \\frac{\\Delta P / R_2}{\\Delta P / R_1} = \\frac{R_1}{R_2} $$\nWe use the expression $R = 8 \\eta L / (\\pi r^4)$. Since $\\eta$ and $L$ are also constant, the resistance $R$ is solely dependent on the radius $r$ as $R \\propto 1/r^4$.\nThe ratio of resistances is:\n$$ \\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \\frac{8 \\eta L / (\\pi r_1^4)}{8 \\eta L / (\\pi r_2^4)} = \\frac{r_2^4}{r_1^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_2}{r_1}\\right)^4 $$\nWe are given that $r_2 = r_1/2$. Substituting this into the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{Q_2}{Q_1} = \\left(\\frac{r_1/2}{r_1}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{16} $$\nThus, if the ureter's radius decreases by $50\\%$, the flow rate decreases by a factor of $16$. The required factor is $1/16$, which is a reduced fraction.\n\nThe final answer is a row vector containing the calculated hydraulic resistance and the flow-change factor.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3.98 \\times 10^7 & \\frac{1}{16} \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "5162254"}, {"introduction": "The connection between the ureter and the bladder, the ureterovesical junction, is more than a simple entry point; it functions as a critical one-way valve to prevent the backflow of urine.

It is deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Problem Solution**\n\nThe problem consists of two parts: first, to calculate the minimum length of the intramural ureter based on a clinical design criterion, and second, to provide a physical justification for this criterion.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Minimum Intramural Ureter Length ($L_{\\min}$)**\n\nThe clinical design target specifies a minimum length-to-diameter ratio for the intramural ureteral segment. This is given as:\n$$\n\\frac{L}{d} \\geq 5\n$$\nwhere $L$ is the length of the intramural ureter and $d$ is its diameter.\n\nThe minimum length, $L_{\\min}$, corresponds to the case of equality in this relationship:\n$$\n\\frac{L_{\\min}}{d} = 5\n$$\nThe problem provides the ureteral diameter as:\n$$\nd = 4\\ \\text{mm}\n$$\nWe can solve for $L_{\\min}$ by substituting the given value of $d$:\n$$\nL_{\\min} = 5 \\times d\n$$\n$$\nL_{\\min} = 5 \\times 4 \\text{ mm} = 20 \\text{ mm}\n$$\nThus, the minimum required length for the intramural ureter to meet the $5:1$ criterion is $20\\ \\text{mm}$.\n\n**Part 2: Justification for the Anti-Reflux Mechanism**\n\nThe anti-reflux mechanism relies on the intramural ureter acting as a passive flap valve, which closes when the intravesical pressure $P_{\\mathrm{ves}}$ increases. A longer intramural segment $L$ enhances this valve-like function in two distinct ways, as explained by the provided physical laws.\n\n1.  **Increased Hydraulic Resistance (Hagen–Poiseuille Relation):**\n\n    Vesicoureteral reflux is the retrograde flow of urine from the bladder into the ureter. This flow, denoted by $Q$, is driven by an adverse pressure gradient, $\\Delta P = P_{\\mathrm{ves}} - P_{\\mathrm{ureter}}$, where $P_{\\mathrm{ves}}$ is the pressure inside the bladder and $P_{\\mathrm{ureter}}$ is the pressure inside the ureter. During bladder contraction (micturition), $P_{\\mathrm{ves}}$ rises significantly, creating a potential for reflux.\n\n    The Hagen–Poiseuille relation, $Q = \\dfrac{\\pi r^{4}}{8 \\mu L}\\,\\Delta P$, quantifies the flow rate. For a fixed pressure gradient $\\Delta P$, ureteral radius $r$, and urine viscosity $\\mu$, the flow rate $Q$ is inversely proportional to the length $L$ of the conduit:\n    $$\n    Q \\propto \\frac{1}{L}\n    $$\n    This relationship shows that increasing the length $L$ of the intramural segment increases its hydraulic resistance to flow. A greater resistance means that for any given pressure gradient promoting reflux, the resulting volume of reflux $Q$ will be smaller. Therefore, a longer intramural ureter inherently provides greater passive resistance to backflow.\n\n2.  **Enhanced Mechanical Coaptation (Laplace's Law and Compression):**\n\n    The primary anti-reflux mechanism is the active compression and closure (coaptation) of the intramural ureter by the contraction of the surrounding detrusor muscle in the bladder wall. This compression is driven by the increase in $P_{\\mathrm{ves}}$.\n\n    The total compressive force exerted by the bladder wall on the ureter acts over the entire length $L$ of the intramural segment. A longer segment provides a greater surface area for this compressive force to act upon. This results in a more effective and reliable seal. Imagine trying to pinch a garden hose shut; pinching it over a longer section creates a much more robust seal against water pressure than pinching at a single point.\n\n    Laplace's law, $T = P r$, describes the wall tension $T$ required to keep the ureter open against a net transmural pressure $P = P_{\\mathrm{ves}} - P_{\\mathrm{ureter}}$. For coaptation to occur, the external compressive force exerted by the detrusor over the length $L$ must be sufficient to overcome the forces that keep the lumen patent, which are related to this wall tension and the structural stiffness of the ureter wall. By increasing $L$, the total applied compressive force increases, ensuring that the lumen can be reliably flattened and sealed even when $P_{\\mathrm{ves}}$ is high. A longer region of coaptation is less susceptible to focal points of leakage, thus providing a more effective valve.\n\n    In summary, increasing $L$ strengthens the anti-reflux mechanism by simultaneously increasing the passive hydraulic resistance to backflow and enhancing the effectiveness of the active mechanical compression that seals the ureteral lumen. The $5:1$ ratio is a clinical guideline derived from experience that ensures $L$ is sufficient for these two physical effects to function reliably.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{20}\n$$", "id": "4946469"}, {"introduction": "The urinary bladder's primary function during its filling phase is to act as a highly distensible, low-pressure reservoir.
