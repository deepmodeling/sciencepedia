We are asked to determine how $Q$ scales with the radius $r$. Assuming $\\Delta P$, $\\eta$, and $L$ are constant, we can express this relationship as a proportionality:\n$$Q \\propto r^4$$\nThis indicates that the volumetric flow rate is extremely sensitive to changes in the vessel radius, scaling with the fourth power of the radius.\n\nNext, we consider the hydrodynamic resistance, $R$, which is defined in the problem statement as:\n$$R = \\frac{\\Delta P}{Q}$$\nTo find the expression for $R$ in terms of the system's geometric and fluid properties, we substitute the Poiseuille equation for $Q$ into this definition:\n$$R = \\frac{\\Delta P}{\\left(\\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}\\right)} = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4}$$\nFrom this expression, we can determine the scaling of resistance $R$ with the radius $r$.

This demonstrates the profound impact of vessel diameter on perfusion, a critical concept in physiological regulation.
