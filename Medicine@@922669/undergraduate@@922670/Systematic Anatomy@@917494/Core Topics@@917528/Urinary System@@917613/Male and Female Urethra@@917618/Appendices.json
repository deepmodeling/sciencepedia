The derivation will be based on the principles of steady, laminar fluid flow through a cylindrical conduit.\n\nFirst, the physical model and governing equations are established. The problem specifies treating urine as a Newtonian fluid and the flow as steady and laminar within a straight cylindrical conduit. Under these conditions, the flow is described by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which relates the volumetric flow rate $Q$ to the pressure drop $\\Delta P$ over a segment of length $L$:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}$$\nwhere $r$ is the radius of the cylindrical lumen and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nHydraulic resistance, $R_{hyd}$, is defined in analogy to electrical resistance, as the ratio of the potential difference (pressure drop $\\Delta P$) to the flow rate (volumetric flow rate $Q$):\n$$R_{hyd} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{Q}$$\nBy rearranging the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, we can express the hydraulic resistance in terms of the geometrical and fluid properties:\n$$R_{hyd} = \\frac{8 \\mu L}{\\pi r^4}$$\nThis equation is the fundamental expression for resistance that will be used for the analysis.\n\nThe problem asks for the change in resistance relative to a baseline. Let the initial (pre-BPH, baseline) state be denoted by subscript $0$ and the final (post-BPH, narrowed) state be denoted by subscript $1$.\nThe initial resistance is:\n$$R_0 = \\frac{8 \\mu L_0}{\\pi r_0^4}$$\nThe final resistance is:\n$$R_1 = \\frac{8 \\mu L_1}{\\pi r_1^4}$$\n\nTo compare $R_1$ and $R_0$, we must state our assumptions regarding which variables remain constant.\n1.  The dynamic viscosity of the fluid (urine), $\\mu$, is constant. This is a justified assumption as the composition of the fluid does not change.\n2.  The length of the prostatic urethral segment, $L$, is constant, so $L_0 = L_1 = L$. This is explicitly stated in the problem (\"unchanged length\").\n\nGiven these constants, the ratio of the final resistance to the initial resistance is:\n$$\\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{\\frac{8 \\mu L}{\\pi r_1^4}}{\\frac{8 \\mu L}{\\pi r_0^4}} = \\frac{r_0^4}{r_1^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_0}{r_1}\\right)^4$$\nThe problem provides information about the cross-sectional area, $A$, not the radius, $r$. The relationship between the area and radius of a circle is $A = \\pi r^2$. We can express the resistance formula in terms of area.\nFrom $A = \\pi r^2$, we have $r^2 = A/\\pi$, and thus $r^4 = (A/\\pi)^2 = A^2/\\pi^2$. Substituting this into the general expression for resistance:\n$$R_{hyd} = \\frac{8 \\mu L}{\\pi (A^2/\\pi^2)} = \\frac{8 \\mu L \\pi}{A^2}$$\nThis shows that hydraulic resistance is inversely proportional to the square of the cross-sectional area: $R_{hyd} \\propto A^{-2}$.\n\nNow, we can compute the ratio of resistances using the areas:\n$$\\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{\\frac{8 \\mu L \\pi}{A_1^2}}{\\frac{8 \\mu L \\pi}{A_0^2}} = \\frac{A_0^2}{A_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{A_0}{A_1}\\right)^2$$\nThe problem states that the narrowing reduces the local cross-sectional area by $0.40$ of its original value, $A_0$. Therefore, the new area, $A_1$, is:\n$$A_1 = A_0 - 0.40 A_0 = (1 - 0.40) A_0 = 0.60 A_0$$\nSubstituting this relationship into the ratio equation:\n$$\\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\left(\\frac{A_0}{0.60 A_0}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{0.60}\\right)^2$$\nTo express this as an exact fraction, we convert the decimal to a fraction: $0.60 = \\frac{60}{100} = \\frac{3}{5}$.\n$$\\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3/5}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{5^2}{3^2} = \\frac{25}{9}$$\nThe multiplicative factor by which the hydraulic resistance increases is therefore $\\frac{25}{9}$. This value is dimensionless, as expected for a ratio of like quantities.\n\nFor the qualitative component: an increase in hydraulic resistance by a factor of $\\frac{25}{9} \\approx 2.78$ is very significant from a physiological perspective. According to the relation $\\Delta P = Q R_{hyd}$, to maintain a normal urinary flow rate ($Q$), the bladder's detrusor muscle would need to generate nearly $2.8$ times the pressure drop across the prostatic urethra. Since the muscle's ability to generate pressure is finite, the more likely outcome is a substantial reduction in flow rate, leading to the classic obstructive symptoms of BPH such as a weak or intermittent stream, hesitancy (a delay in starting urination as pressure builds), and straining. The marked increase in resistance arises from the powerful inverse fourth-power dependence on radius ($R_{hyd} \\propto r^{-4}$), meaning even a modest decrease in luminal radius causes a large increase in resistance.\nThis specific pathophysiological mechanism is unique to the male anatomy. The female urethra is substantially shorter (approximately $4$ cm vs. $20$ cm in males) and does not have an encircling prostate gland. Consequently, it is not subject to compressive obstruction from BPH. While lower urinary tract symptoms in females can occur due to other causes, the anatomical basis for obstruction presented in this problem is exclusively a male pathology.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{25}{9}}$$", "id": "5125389"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of hydraulic resistance, this exercise shifts the focus from a pathological state to the normal anatomy of the male urethra. You will compare the contributions of two distinct segments—the short, narrow membranous urethra and the long, wider spongy urethra—to the total resistance to urine flow.

A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of fluid flow through two cylindrical tubes in series, based on the principles of laminar flow. The relationship between pressure drop ($\\Delta p$), volumetric flow rate ($Q$), fluid viscosity ($\\eta$), tube length ($L$), and tube radius ($r$) for steady laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid is described by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta p}{8 \\eta L}\n$$\nThe problem defines hydraulic resistance, $R$, as the ratio of pressure drop to flow rate:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\Delta p}{Q}\n$$\nTo derive the dependence of $R$ on $L$ and $r$, we rearrange the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to solve for the ratio $\\Delta p/Q$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta p}{Q} = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4}\n$$\nTherefore, the hydraulic resistance $R$ is given by:\n$$\nR = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4}\n$$\nThis equation shows that for a given fluid viscosity $\\eta$, the resistance $R$ is directly proportional to the length $L$ and inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius $r$ ($R \\propto L/r^4$). This completes the first part of the task.\n\nNext, we compute the hydraulic resistance for each urethral segment. For the membranous segment, the resistance $R_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{8 \\eta L_{\\mathrm{m}}}{\\pi r_{\\mathrm{m}}^4}\n$$\nFor the spongy segment, the resistance $R_{\\mathrm{s}}$ is:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{8 \\eta L_{\\mathrm{s}}}{\\pi r_{\\mathrm{s}}^4}\n$$\nWe are asked to find the dimensionless ratio $R_{\\mathrm{m}}/R_{\\mathrm{s}}$. Taking the ratio of the two expressions, the constant terms $8$, $\\eta$, and $\\pi$ cancel out, as the fluid (urine) is the same in both segments:\n$$\n\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{m}}}{R_{\\mathrm{s}}} = \\frac{\\frac{8 \\eta L_{\\mathrm{m}}}{\\pi r_{\\mathrm{m}}^4}}{\\frac{8 \\eta L_{\\mathrm{s}}}{\\pi r_{\\mathrm{s}}^4}} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{m}}}{r_{\\mathrm{m}}^4} \\cdot \\frac{r_{\\mathrm{s}}^4}{L_{\\mathrm{s}}}\n$$\nThis can be rearranged into a more convenient form:\n$$\n\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{m}}}{R_{\\mathrm{s}}} = \\left(\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{m}}}{L_{\\mathrm{s}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{r_{\\mathrm{s}}}{r_{\\mathrm{m}}}\\right)^4\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given values: $L_{\\mathrm{m}}=2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, $L_{\\mathrm{s}}=15\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, $r_{\\mathrm{m}}=2.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, and $r_{\\mathrm{s}}=3.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. It is crucial to maintain consistent units within each ratio, but the units for length and radius do not need to be the same as they are in separate ratios.\n$$\n\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{m}}}{L_{\\mathrm{s}}} = \\frac{2\\,\\mathrm{cm}}{15\\,\\mathrm{cm}} = \\frac{2}{15}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{r_{\\mathrm{s}}}{r_{\\mathrm{m}}} = \\frac{3.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{2.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}} = \\frac{3}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting these ratios back into the expression for $R_{\\mathrm{m}}/R_{\\mathrm{s}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{m}}}{R_{\\mathrm{s}}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{15}\\right) \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2}{15} \\cdot \\frac{3^4}{2^4} = \\frac{2}{15} \\cdot \\frac{81}{16}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$\n\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{m}}}{R_{\\mathrm{s}}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 81}{15 \\cdot 16} = \\frac{81}{15 \\cdot 8} = \\frac{81}{120}\n$$\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $3$:\n$$\n\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{m}}}{R_{\\mathrm{s}}} = \\frac{81 \\div 3}{120 \\div 3} = \\frac{27}{40}\n$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives the final dimensionless ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{m}}}{R_{\\mathrm{s}}} = 0.675\n$$\nFinally, we interpret this result. For components in series, the total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances: $R_{\\mathrm{total}} = R_{\\mathrm{m}} + R_{\\mathrm{s}}$. The segment with the larger resistance value contributes more to the total resistance. Since the ratio $R_{\\mathrm{m}}/R_{\\mathrm{s}} = 0.675$ is less than $1$, it implies that $R_{\\mathrm{m}}  R_{\\mathrm{s}}$. Therefore, the spongy urethra ($R_{\\mathrm{s}}$) contributes more to the overall hydraulic resistance than the membranous urethra ($R_{\\mathrm{m}}$). This occurs because its much greater length ($L_{\\mathrm{s}}/L_{\\mathrm{m}} = 7.5$) has a stronger influence on resistance than its larger radius ($r_{\\mathrm{s}}/r_{\\mathrm{m}} = 1.5$), given that resistance scales linearly with length but with the inverse fourth power of the radius.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.675}\n$$", "id": "5125415"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice moves from the dynamics of voiding to the crucial function of continence, which relies on the urethra's ability to remain securely closed.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective, allowing for a rigorous, principle-based solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe maximal urethral closure pressure (MUCP) is a quantitative measure of the sealing function of the urethra at rest. It represents the sum of contributions from all components that constitute the intrinsic urethral sphincter mechanism. The provided typical values are approximately $55\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$ for females and $70\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$ for males. The patient's value of $30\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$ is significantly reduced, indicating a substantial failure of the closure mechanism.\n\nThe total resting MUCP can be conceptually broken down into contributions from its primary components:\n$1$. The internal urethral sphincter (smooth muscle) at the bladder neck/proximal urethra.\n$2$. The external urethral sphincter (striated muscle, or rhabdosphincter).\n$3$. The urethral mucosa and submucosal vascular plexus, which provide a \"cushion\" or \"seal\" effect through coaptation of the urethral lining.\n\nA common rule of thumb in urodynamics is that these three components contribute roughly equally to the resting pressure, each accounting for about one-third of the total MUCP. A significant drop in MUCP to $30\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$ from a normal baseline of $55-70\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$ represents a reduction of approximately $45-57\\%$. A deficit of this magnitude is highly unlikely to be caused by the failure of a single component. For instance, if only the external sphincter failed, one would expect the MUCP to drop by about one-third, resulting in a value around $37\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$ in a female or $47\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$ in a male, which are still substantially higher than the measured $30\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$.\n\nA value of $30\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$ or lower is the classic threshold used to diagnose **intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD)**. ISD is defined not by the failure of one specific component, but by a global weakness of the urethral sphincter complex, most often involving damage to both the striated muscle of the rhabdosphincter and the integrity of the mucosal/submucosal tissues. This combined failure results in poor urethral coaptation and a severely compromised sealing pressure.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Combined deficiency of the external urethral sphincter (striated rhabdosphincter) and the urethral mucosa/submucosal vascular plexus (intrinsic sphincter deficiency)**\nThis option describes the exact pathophysiology of intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD). A combined failure of the striated muscle sphincter and the mucosal/submucosal seal would lead to a profound decrease in the resting MUCP. As derived above, a pressure of $30\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$ is a hallmark of this condition. This is the most plausible explanation for the severe reduction in closure pressure.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Pelvic floor (levator ani) hypotonia alone with intact sphincters and mucosa**\nThe pelvic floor muscles (levator ani) provide *extrinsic* support to the urethra. Their primary role in continence is to provide a \"backstop\" during increases in intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., coughing, sneezing), which prevents urethral hypermobility and subsequent leakage. While pelvic floor weakness is a common cause of stress urinary incontinence (Type I or II), it does not significantly affect the *resting* MUCP. The resting pressure is almost entirely determined by the *intrinsic* components of the urethra (sphincters and mucosa). If these intrinsic components are \"intact\" as stated, the resting MUCP would be normal or near-normal.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Increased bladder compliance with detrusor underactivity**\nThese terms describe the function of the urinary bladder (the reservoir), not the urethra (the outlet). Increased compliance means the bladder can store large volumes of urine at low pressures. Detrusor underactivity means the bladder muscle is weak, leading to inefficient emptying. These conditions are related to urinary storage and voiding phases and are typically associated with urinary retention and overflow incontinence. They do not directly cause a reduction in the pressure generated by the urethral sphincter itself. The MUCP is a measure of urethral strength relative to bladder pressure, and a pathology of the urethral sphincter is needed to explain such a low value.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Isolated reduction in proximal urethral length with otherwise normal sphincteric tissues**\nUrethral pressure profilometry yields a pressure profile over the length of the urethra. The functional urethral length is the distance over which urethral pressure exceeds bladder pressure. While a short functional length can contribute to incontinence, the MUCP is the *peak* pressure value recorded along this length. If the sphincteric tissues are \"otherwise normal,\" they should be capable of generating a normal peak pressure, even if this pressure is exerted over a shorter distance. A low MUCP indicates weak tissue, not just a shorter segment of strong tissue.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5125450"}]}
