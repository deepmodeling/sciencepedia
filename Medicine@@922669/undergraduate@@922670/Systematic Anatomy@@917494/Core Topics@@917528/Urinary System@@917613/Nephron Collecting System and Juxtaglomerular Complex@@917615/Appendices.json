It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective, providing a clear and solvable task based on established biological principles. The solution will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\nThe problem asks to identify the histological features of the \"specialized sensor cells that mediate tubuloglomerular feedback.\" By definition, these cells constitute the **macula densa**. The macula densa is a specialized plaque of epithelial cells located in the wall of the distal nephron where it passes between the afferent and efferent arterioles at the vascular pole of its parent glomerulus. It is a critical component of the juxtaglomerular apparatus ($JGA$).\n\nThe task is to differentiate these macula densa cells from the \"neighboring absorptive epithelium,\" which, in this anatomical context, refers to the cells of the cortical thick ascending limb ($TAL$) of the loop of Henle, from which the macula densa is a specialized continuation.\n\nWe apply the stated fundamental bases:\n\n1.  **Nephron Segmental Organization and $JGA$ Architecture:** The macula densa is anatomically positioned to sense the tubular fluid composition just before it enters the distal convoluted tubule and to signal the vascular components of the $JGA$. This physical proximity is key. The macula densa cells are in direct basal contact with the extraglomerular mesangial cells (also known as lacis cells) and, through them, the juxtaglomerular (or granular) cells in the wall of the afferent arteriole. This structural arrangement is essential for paracrine signaling.\n\n2.  **Epithelial Polarity and the Structure-Function Principle:**\n    - **Thick Ascending Limb ($TAL$) Cells:** The primary function of $TAL$ cells is the active reabsorption of a large amount of $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ from the tubular fluid. This is a highly energy-dependent process, driven by the basolateral $\\mathrm{Na}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-ATPase. To support this high transport capacity, the cells' structure is optimized for absorption: they possess extensive and deep basolateral membrane infoldings, which massively increase the surface area for ion pumps, and are packed with numerous, large mitochondria to supply the necessary $ATP$. Their nuclei are typically round and evenly spaced.\n    - **Macula Densa ($MD$) Cells:** The primary function of $MD$ cells is sensory, not bulk transport. They sense the luminal $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ concentration via the apical $\\mathrm{Na}^+$-$\\mathrm{K}^+$-$2\\mathrm{Cl}^-$ cotransporter (NKCC2). Their response is to release signaling molecules (e.g., $ATP$, adenosine) from their basolateral surface to modulate arteriolar tone and renin release. This sensory and signaling role requires a different morphology.\n        -   Structurally, $MD$ cells are taller and more slender than the surrounding $TAL$ cells. This causes their nuclei to be crowded together, forming a dense-looking plaque on cross-section, which gives the structure its name (\"dense spot\").\n        -   The apical surface has sparse, short microvilli, consistent with a sensory rather than a high-capacity absorptive function.\n        -   Crucially, because their primary role is not massive ion transport, $MD$ cells have **significantly fewer and less complex basolateral infoldings and a much lower density of mitochondria** compared to the adjacent $TAL$ cells. This is a key distinguishing feature at the ultrastructural (electron microscopy) level.\n        -   The basal lamina separating the $MD$ from the underlying extraglomerular mesangium is often thin or fenestrated, facilitating rapid diffusion of signaling molecules.\n\nIn summary, the macula densa is distinguished from the adjacent $TAL$ by its plaque-like appearance with crowded nuclei, its specific basal apposition to other $JGA$ components, and its comparatively reduced machinery for transport (fewer mitochondria and less basolateral infolding).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. A tall epithelial plaque with markedly crowded nuclei, an apical specialization with a tight junction belt and sparse microvilli, and basolateral contact specializations directly apposed to extraglomerular mesangial (lacis) cells and juxtaglomerular renin cells toward the vascular pole; comparatively reduced basolateral infoldings and mitochondrial density relative to adjacent absorptive thick ascending limb cells.**\nThis option comprehensively and accurately describes the defining features of macula densa cells.

It is an accurate description of $TAL$ cells, but it is not the answer to the question, which asks for the features of the sensor cells themselves.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Proximal tubule features including a prominent apical brush border, abundant endocytic vesicles and lysosomes, aquaporin-1 water channels, and location distant from the vascular pole, without specialized contact to the afferent arteriole.**\nThis option describes the cells of the proximal convoluted tubule ($PCT$). Key features like the prominent brush border (dense, long microvilli) and extensive endocytic apparatus are characteristic of the $PCT$, not the macula densa.

Principal cell morphology of the collecting duct with an apical primary cilium, antidiuretic hormone (ADH)-regulated aquaporin-2 water channels, and intercalated cells interspersed, lacking direct structural integration with the juxtaglomerular apparatus.**\nThis option describes the epithelium of the collecting duct. The presence of principal cells (with regulatable aquaporin-$2$ channels) and intercalated cells is unique to the collecting system.
