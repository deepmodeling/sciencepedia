A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires calculating the epithelial surface area magnification factor, $F$. This factor is the ratio of the total true epithelial surface area, $A_{true}$, to the initial flat reference area, $A_{ref} = 1\\,\\text{cm}^{2}$.\nFirst, we must ensure all parameters are in consistent units. We will convert all length measurements to centimeters ($\\text{cm}$).\n-   Crypt radius: $r = 0.20\\,\\text{mm} = 0.020\\,\\text{cm}$.\n-   Crypt depth: $d = 1.5\\,\\text{mm} = 0.15\\,\\text{cm}$.\n-   Crypt density: $\\rho = 25\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$.\n-   Reference area: $A_{ref} = 1\\,\\text{cm}^{2}$.\n\nThe total number of crypts, $N$, within the reference area $A_{ref}$ is given by:\n$$N = \\rho \\times A_{ref}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$N = 25\\,\\text{cm}^{-2} \\times 1\\,\\text{cm}^{2} = 25$$\n\nThe total true epithelial area, $A_{true}$, is the sum of the flat epithelial area between the crypt openings and the total surface area inside all the crypts.\n\nLet's first determine the area of the flat surface. The original area is $A_{ref}$. Each crypt creates a circular opening on this surface. The area of one such opening is $A_{opening} = \\pi r^2$. The total area occupied by all crypt openings is $N \\times A_{opening}$.\nThe remaining flat surface area, $A_{surface\\_flat}$, is therefore:\n$$A_{surface\\_flat} = A_{ref} - N \\times A_{opening} = A_{ref} - (\\rho A_{ref})(\\pi r^2)$$\n\nNext, let's determine the surface area contributed by the interior of a single crypt, $A_{crypt}$. A crypt is modeled as a right circular cylinder that is open at the top. Its surface area consists of the lateral (wall) surface area, $A_{lateral}$, and the area of the circular bottom, $A_{bottom}$.\n$$A_{lateral} = 2 \\pi r d$$\n$$A_{bottom} = \\pi r^2$$\nThus, the surface area inside a single crypt is:\n$$A_{crypt} = A_{lateral} + A_{bottom} = 2 \\pi r d + \\pi r^2$$\n\nThe total surface area contributed by the interiors of all $N$ crypts, $A_{crypts\\_total}$, is:\n$$A_{crypts\\_total} = N \\times A_{crypt} = (\\rho A_{ref})(2 \\pi r d + \\pi r^2)$$\n\nThe true total epithelial area, $A_{true}$, is the sum of the remaining flat surface area and the total interior crypt area:\n$$A_{true} = A_{surface\\_flat} + A_{crypts\\_total}$$\n$$A_{true} = (A_{ref} - \\rho A_{ref} \\pi r^2) + (\\rho A_{ref})(2 \\pi r d + \\pi r^2)$$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$A_{true} = A_{ref} - \\rho A_{ref} \\pi r^2 + 2 \\pi \\rho A_{ref} r d + \\rho A_{ref} \\pi r^2$$\nThe term $\\rho A_{ref} \\pi r^2$ cancels out. This is logical: the area of the epithelial surface lost at the crypt opening is exactly replaced by the area of the crypt floor, as both are circles of radius $r$. The net increase in area comes solely from the lateral walls of the cylindrical crypts.\n$$A_{true} = A_{ref} + 2 \\pi \\rho A_{ref} r d$$\n\nThe magnification factor $F$ is defined as $F = \\frac{A_{true}}{A_{ref}}$.\n$$F = \\frac{A_{ref} + 2 \\pi \\rho A_{ref} r d}{A_{ref}}$$\n$$F = 1 + 2 \\pi \\rho r d$$\n\nNow we substitute the numerical values into this final expression for $F$:\n-   $\\rho = 25\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$\n-   $r = 0.020\\,\\text{cm}$\n-   $d = 0.15\\,\\text{cm}$\n\n$$F = 1 + 2 \\pi (25) (0.020) (0.15)$$\nCalculate the product of the numerical terms:\n$$(25) \\times (0.020) \\times (0.15) = 0.5 \\times 0.15 = 0.075$$\nSo, the expression for $F$ becomes:\n$$F = 1 + 2 \\pi (0.075)$$\n$$F = 1 + 0.15 \\pi$$\nUsing the value of $\\pi \\approx 3.14159265...$:\n$$F \\approx 1 + 0.15 \\times 3.14159265...$$\n$$F \\approx 1 + 0.47123889...$$\n$$F \\approx 1.47123889...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1.471$. The fifth significant digit is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$F \\approx 1.471$$\nThe magnification factor is a dimensionless quantity, as expected.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.471}$$", "id": "5159659"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its overall shape, the functional capacity of an organ is often determined by the distribution of its neurovascular resources.
