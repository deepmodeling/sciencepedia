Blood flows from portal tracts to central veins, creating a gradient in oxygen and nutrients across the functional unit known as the hepatic acinus. This practice challenges you to apply this concept to map the acinar zones and predict which hepatocytes are most susceptible to injury from low oxygen (hypoxia) [@problem_id:5121955]. Mastering this model is key to understanding many forms of liver disease.", "problem": "A histologic section of human liver shows a single central vein (terminal hepatic venule) surrounded by three ($3$) portal tracts that together approximate a diamond-shaped functional unit. Each portal tract contains a branch of the portal vein, a branch of the hepatic artery, and a bile duct, which are conduits that enter and leave the liver via the porta hepatis. Using the concept of the hepatic acinus (Rappaport), define the acinar zones $1$ through $3$ relative to the central vein and the portal tracts, starting from a base of well-tested facts about intrahepatic blood flow and oxygen delivery: blood enters sinusoids from branches of the portal vein and hepatic artery in the portal tracts and flows toward the central vein; hepatocytes extract oxygen along the sinusoidal path, establishing a gradient of partial pressure of oxygen ($pO_2$) from periportal to pericentral regions.

This arrangement approximates a diamond-shaped functional unit.\n2.  **Portal Tract Contents:** Each portal tract contains a branch of the portal vein, a branch of the hepatic artery, and a bile duct.\n3.  **Functional Model:** The analysis is to be based on the concept of the hepatic acinus (Rappaport).\n4.  **Blood Flow Direction:** Blood enters sinusoids from branches of the portal vein and hepatic artery located in the portal tracts and flows toward the central vein.\n5.  **Oxygen Gradient:** Hepatocytes extract oxygen along the sinusoidal path, which establishes a gradient of partial pressure of oxygen ($pO_2$) from periportal to pericentral regions.\n6.  **Question:** The task is to define acinar zones $1$, $2$, and $3$ relative to the central vein and portal tracts and to predict which hepatocytes are most vulnerable to hypoxia based on this framework.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe provided problem statement is evaluated against the established criteria.\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded:** The description of liver microanatomy, including the central vein, portal tracts (containing the portal triad), and the direction of blood flow from portal tracts to the central vein, is a cornerstone of medical histology and physiology. The concept of the hepatic acinus as proposed by Rappaport is a standard and widely accepted functional model of the liver, contrasting with the classic anatomical lobule. The existence of a $pO_2$ gradient across the acinus is a well-documented physiological fact. Therefore, the problem is scientifically sound.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a set of consistent and sufficient premises (the acinar model, blood flow direction, oxygen consumption) and asks for a logical deduction based on these premises (zonal mapping and hypoxic vulnerability). A unique and stable solution can be derived.\n*   **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and objective, using standard terminology from anatomy and physiology. It is free from subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is internally consistent, scientifically accurate, and well-posed. It presents a standard scenario for understanding liver pathophysiology. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. The solution will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe problem requires the application of the Rappaport acinar model to liver histology and physiology.\n\n1.  **The Hepatic Acinus (Rappaport Model):** This model defines the primary functional unit of the liver based on its blood supply. The acinus is conceptualized as a diamond-shaped or oval mass of hepatocytes oriented around the terminal afferent vessels (branches of the portal vein and hepatic artery) as they leave the portal tract. Its long axis connects two adjacent central veins, and its short axis connects two adjacent portal tracts. For simplicity, as described in the problem, the acinus is defined by the blood supply radiating from a terminal portal tract.\n\n2.  **Definition of Acinar Zones:** The acinus is divided into three zones based on the proximity of hepatocytes to the afferent blood supply originating from the portal tract.\n    *   **Zone $1$:** This zone is closest to the afferent vessels in the portal tract. It receives blood that is richest in oxygen and nutrients. Consequently, hepatocytes in Zone $1$ are referred to as periportal.\n    *   **Zone $3$:** This zone is the most distant from the afferent vessels and is located adjacent to the terminal hepatic venule (central vein). It receives blood that has already perfused Zones $1$ and $2$ and is therefore lowest in oxygen and nutrient content. Hepatocytes in Zone $3$ are referred to as pericentral or centrilobular.\n    *   **Zone $2$:** This is the intermediate zone, lying between Zones $1$ and $3$. It has perfusion and metabolic characteristics that are intermediate between the other two zones.\n\n3.  **Prediction of Hypoxic Vulnerability:** The problem explicitly states that blood flows from the portal tracts to the central vein, and hepatocytes extract oxygen along this path. This establishes a decreasing $pO_2$ gradient from Zone $1$ to Zone $3$.\n    *   Blood enters Zone $1$ with the highest $pO_2$.\n    *   As blood flows through the sinusoids, its $pO_2$ progressively decreases.\n    *   By the time blood reaches Zone $3$, its $pO_2$ is at its lowest point before entering the central vein.\n    *   Therefore, the hepatocytes in Zone $3$ exist in a state of relative physiological hypoxia compared to Zone $1$. In pathological conditions that decrease overall hepatic blood flow or oxygenation (e.g., ischemia from shock, heart failure), the hepatocytes in Zone $3$ are the first to suffer and die from hypoxia. This phenomenon is known as centrilobular necrosis.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Zone $1$ comprises hepatocytes adjacent to the portal tracts, zone $2$ lies intermediate, and zone $3$ is adjacent to the central vein; blood flows from the portal tracts toward the central vein, so zone $3$ hepatocytes are most vulnerable to hypoxia.**\nThis statement accurately describes the zonation of the Rappaport acinus (Zone $1$ = periportal, Zone $3$ = pericentral). It correctly states the direction of blood flow. Based on these correct premises, it draws the correct conclusion that Zone $3$ hepatocytes are the most vulnerable to hypoxia.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Zone $1$ comprises hepatocytes adjacent to the central vein, zone $2$ lies intermediate, and zone $3$ is adjacent to the portal tracts; blood flows from the central vein toward the portal tracts, so zone $1$ hepatocytes are most vulnerable to hypoxia.**\nThis statement reverses both the zonal numbering and the direction of blood flow. Zone $1$ is periportal, not pericentral. Blood flows *to* the central vein, not *from* it. The entire premise is factually incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Zone $1$ is near portal tracts, zone $2$ is intermediate, and zone $3$ is near the central vein; however, because the hepatic artery predominantly delivers oxygen to the central vein region, zone $2$ hepatocytes are most vulnerable to hypoxia.**\nWhile the mapping of zones is correct, the assertion that the hepatic artery delivers oxygen predominantly to the central vein region is false. The hepatic artery's terminal branches are in the portal tracts, and its oxygenated blood mixes with portal venous blood to flow *towards* the central vein. The conclusion that Zone $2$ is most vulnerable is arbitrary and contradicts the established oxygen gradient.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Acinar zones are defined by bile flow from canaliculi to bile ductules at the portal tracts rather than by blood flow; therefore, hepatocytes near portal tracts are most vulnerable to hypoxia due to bile stasis.**\nThe fundamental premise is wrong. The acinar model of Rappaport is explicitly defined by the microvascular blood supply and the resulting metabolic gradients. Bile flow occurs in the opposite direction (from the pericentral region toward the portal tracts), but it is not the basis for acinar zonation. Furthermore, the question is specifically about vulnerability to *hypoxia*, which is a function of blood oxygenation, not bile flow dynamics.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The acinus is a physiological construct not inferable from histology; acinar zones cannot be mapped in a section with a central vein and portal tracts, and vulnerability to hypoxia is uniform across hepatocytes.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While the acinus is a functional concept, its zones are routinely mapped onto histological sections by identifying the key anatomical landmarks (portal tracts and central veins). The statement that vulnerability to hypoxia is uniform is a direct contradiction of the established oxygen gradient within the liver lobule/acinus, a premise given in the problem itself.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5121955"}, {"introduction": "Our understanding of hepatic hemodynamics allows us not only to diagnose but also to intervene when flow is impaired, as in cirrhosis.
