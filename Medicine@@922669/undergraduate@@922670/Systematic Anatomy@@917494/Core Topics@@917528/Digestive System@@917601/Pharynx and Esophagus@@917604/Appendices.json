This practice delves into the physiology of the LES by applying the fundamental concept of pressure gradients between the abdomen and the thorax.

In systematic anatomy of the pharynx and esophagus, the Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES) acts as a circular muscular valve that prevents retrograde flow from the stomach into the esophagus by generating a resting closure pressure.

The LES acts as a circular muscular valve that resists retrograde flow from the stomach to the esophagus.\n\nWe begin from the fundamental principle that flow occurs from higher to lower pressure. The net driving pressure for reflux across the LES from stomach to esophagus is the pressure difference between the gastric lumen and the esophageal lumen, which we define as\n$$\n\\Delta P_{\\text{drive}} = P_{g} - P_{e}.\n$$\nIf $\\Delta P_{\\text{drive}} > 0$, the stomach is at higher pressure than the esophagus and, in the absence of a barrier, fluid would move retrograde into the esophagus.\n\nTo prevent reflux under quasi-static conditions, the sphincter must generate an opposing closure pressure that is at least as large as the net driving pressure, so that the effective trans-sphincter pressure available to open the sphincter is zero or negative. Denote the LES resting closure pressure by $P_{LES}$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of static mechanics, specifically the derivation of the Law of Laplace for a thin-walled cylinder, which is a standard and appropriate model for analyzing stresses in biological vessels like esophageal varices. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data, assumptions, and conversion factors for a unique solution. The given values for transmural pressure and radius are physiologically plausible.\n\nThe objective is to first derive the relationship between circumferential wall tension per unit length, $T$, the transmural pressure, $P$, and the internal radius, $r$, for a thin-walled cylinder. Subsequently, we are to calculate the numerical value of $T$ for a specific esophageal varix.\n\nWe begin the derivation by considering a segment of the idealized cylindrical varix of length $L$ and radius $r$. To analyze the forces, we conceptually bisect this segment along its longitudinal axis. The transmural pressure, $P$, which is the pressure difference between the inside (lumen) and the outside, acts perpendicularly on the internal surface of the cylindrical wall. This pressure creates an outward-directed force that tends to separate the two halves of the bisected segment.\n\nThe total bursting force, $F_p$, due to this pressure must be calculated by integrating the component of the pressure force that is perpendicular to the plane of bisection. It is equivalent to the pressure $P$ acting on the projected area of the internal curved surface onto the bisection plane. This projected area is a rectangle with dimensions equal to the diameter of the cylinder, $2r$, and the length of the segment, $L$.\nTherefore, the total pressure force is given by:\n$$F_p = P \\times (\\text{Projected Area}) = P \\times (2rL)$$\n\nIn static equilibrium, this outward-directed pressure force must be exactly balanced by an inward-directed force generated by the tension within the cylindrical wall. This is the circumferential wall tension. The problem asks for the wall tension per unit length, denoted as $T$. This tension acts along the two cut edges of the wall. Each cut edge has a length $L$. Thus, the total restoring force from the wall tension, $F_T$, is the sum of the forces along both edges.\n$$F_T = T \\times L + T \\times L = 2TL$$\n\nFor the cylinder to be in mechanical equilibrium, the pressure force must equal the tension force:\n$$F_p = F_T$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $F_p$ and $F_T$:\n$$P(2rL) = 2TL$$\nWe can divide both sides of the equation by the common factor $2L$ (assuming $L>0$):\n$$Pr = T$$\nThis is the Law of Laplace for a thin-walled cylinder, which provides the desired relationship between the circumferential wall tension per unit length ($T$), the transmural pressure ($P$), and the radius ($r$).\n\nNext, we use this derived relationship to calculate the wall tension for the given parameters. The problem provides:\nTransmural pressure, $P = 25$ mmHg\nInternal radius, $r = 3$ mm\n\nWe must first convert these values to SI units (pascals for pressure and meters for radius) to obtain the tension in newtons per meter (N/m).\nThe given conversion factors are:\n$1$ mmHg $= 133.322$ Pa\n$1$ mm $= 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n\nConverting the pressure $P$:\n$$P = 25 \\text{ mmHg} \\times \\frac{133.322 \\text{ Pa}}{1 \\text{ mmHg}} = 3333.05 \\text{ Pa}$$\nNote that a pascal (Pa) is defined as one newton per square meter ($1 \\text{ Pa} = 1 \\text{ N/m}^2$).\n\nConverting the radius $r$:\n$$r = 3 \\text{ mm} \\times \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m}}{1 \\text{ mm}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these SI values into the derived formula $T = Pr$:\n$$T = (3333.05 \\text{ N/m}^2) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m})$$\n$$T = 9999.15 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ N/m}$$\n$$T = 9.99915 \\text{ N/m}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\nThe calculated value is $9.99915$.
