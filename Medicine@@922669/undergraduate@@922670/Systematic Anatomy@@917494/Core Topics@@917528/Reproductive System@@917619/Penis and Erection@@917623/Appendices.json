Modeling blood as an incompressible Newtonian fluid and the artery as a rigid pipe are standard and valid simplifications for this type of hemodynamic analysis, especially in larger vessels where shear rates are high.

A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe physical situation described—steady, fully developed, incompressible laminar flow through a straight, rigid cylindrical pipe—is governed by the Hagen-Poiseuille law. This law quantifies the relationship between the volumetric flow rate $Q$, the pressure drop $\\Delta P$, the fluid's dynamic viscosity $\\mu$, and the geometry of the pipe (radius $r$ and length $L$). The equation is:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}$$\n\nWe are asked to compare the volumetric inflow in two distinct physiological states: a flaccid state (state $0$) and an erect state (state $1$). We can apply the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to each state.\n\nFor the flaccid state (state $0$), the radius is $r_0$, and the volumetric flow rate is $Q_0$. The equation is:\n$$Q_0 = \\frac{\\pi r_0^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}$$\n\nFor the erect state (state $1$), the radius is $r_1$, and the volumetric flow rate is $Q_1$. The problem states that the vasodilation process results in $r_1 = 2 r_0$. The parameters $\\Delta P$, $\\mu$, and $L$ are held constant. The equation for this state is:\n$$Q_1 = \\frac{\\pi r_1^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}$$\n\nTo find the multiplicative factor by which the inflow changes, we need to compute the ratio $Q_1 / Q_0$. We construct this ratio using the expressions for $Q_1$ and $Q_0$:\n$$\\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\pi r_1^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{\\pi r_0^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}\\right)}$$\n\nThe constant terms $\\pi$, $\\Delta P$, $8$, $\\mu$, and $L$ are common to both the numerator and the denominator, and thus they cancel out. This simplification leaves a relationship dependent only on the radii:\n$$\\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = \\frac{r_1^4}{r_0^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_0}\\right)^4$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given relationship between the radii, $r_1 = 2 r_0$, into this expression:\n$$\\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = \\left(\\frac{2 r_0}{r_0}\\right)^4$$\n\nThe term $r_0$ in the numerator and denominator within the parentheses cancels out, leaving:\n$$\\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = (2)^4$$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $2$ raised to the power of $4$:\n$$\\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = 16$$\n\nThis result demonstrates that doubling the radius of the artery, while keeping the pressure gradient constant, increases the volumetric blood flow by a factor of $16$.

The idealization of a corpus cavernosum as a thin-walled pressure vessel is a standard and appropriate simplification in biomechanics, and the provided physiological parameters are realistic.\n\nWe proceed with the derivation. The problem asks for the circumferential tension per unit axial length, $T_{\\theta}$, in the wall of a thin-walled cylinder. We are instructed to use a free-body diagram created by slicing the cylinder longitudinally.\n\nLet the cylinder have an internal radius $r$ and an arbitrary axial length $L$. The internal fluid pressure is a uniform gauge pressure $P$. Consider a free-body diagram of one half of this cylindrical segment, created by cutting it through a plane containing the central axis.\n\nTwo principal forces act on this free-body in the circumferential direction.\n$1$. The force exerted by the internal pressure $P$. This pressure acts normal to the internal surface of the semi-cylinder. To find the net force pushing the two halves apart, we consider the force exerted on the projected area of the cut. This projected area is a rectangle with dimensions $2r$ (the diameter of the cylinder) and $L$ (the length of the segment). The area is $A_p = 2rL$. The total force due to pressure, $F_P$, is the product of the pressure and this projected area:\n$$F_P = P \\cdot A_p = P(2rL)$$\nThis force acts perpendicularly to the plane of the cut, tending to separate the two halves of the cylinder.\n\n$2$. The resisting force exerted by the material of the cylinder wall. This force is the circumferential tension within the tunica albuginea. The problem defines $T_{\\theta}$ as the tension per unit axial length. This tension acts along the two cut edges of the wall. Each cut edge has a length $L$. Therefore, the total tensile force, $F_T$, resisting the separation is the product of the tension per unit length and the total length of the cut edges, which is $2L$.\n$$F_T = T_{\\theta} \\cdot (2L) = 2T_{\\theta}L$$\nThis force acts in the plane of the cut, opposing the pressure-induced force $F_P$.\n\nFor the cylinder to be in static equilibrium, the sum of forces in any direction must be zero. Applying this condition in the direction perpendicular to the cut plane, the force due to pressure must be balanced by the total tensile force in the wall:\n$$\\sum F = 0$$\n$$F_P - F_T = 0 \\implies F_P = F_T$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $F_P$ and $F_T$:\n$$P(2rL) = 2T_{\\theta}L$$\nThe arbitrary length $L$ appears on both sides of the equation and can be canceled. This is expected, as we are determining a property per unit length.\n$$2Pr = 2T_{\\theta}$$\nSolving for the circumferential tension per unit length, $T_{\\theta}$, we obtain:\n$$T_{\\theta} = Pr$$\nThis result is a specific form of the Law of Laplace for a cylindrical membrane.\n\nNext, we evaluate $T_{\\theta}$ using the given numerical values.

This phenomenon is described by Euler's critical load theory for slender columns. The governing differential equation for the lateral deflection $y(x)$ of a column under an axial load $P$ is:\n$$EI \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + Py = 0$$\nThe general solution to this second-order linear homogeneous differential equation is:\n$$y(x) = C_1 \\sin\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{P}{EI}}x\\right) + C_2 \\cos\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{P}{EI}}x\\right)$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nFor a general set of boundary conditions, the critical load for the first buckling mode ($n=1$) is given by the generalized Euler formula:\n$$P_{\\text{cr}} = \\frac{\\pi^2 EI}{L_{\\text{eff}}^2}$$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus of the material, $I$ is the second moment of area of the cross-section, and $L_{\\text{eff}}$ is the effective length of the column.\n\nThe effective length, $L_{\\text{eff}}$, accounts for the boundary conditions and is related to the column's actual length $L$ by the effective length factor $K$:\n$$L_{\\text{eff}} = K L$$\nThe factor $K$ depends on how the ends of the column are supported. The problem describes the proximal end as \"mechanically fixed\" and the distal end as free to \"rotate with negligible bending moment\", which corresponds to a fixed-pinned boundary condition. For this case, the theoretically derived effective length factor is $K \\approx 0.699$, which is consistent with the provided value of $K = 0.70$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for the effective length into the Euler formula yields the analytical expression for the critical buckling load in terms of the given parameters:\n$$P_{\\text{cr}} = \\frac{\\pi^2 EI}{(KL)^2}$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the smallest axial load that will induce buckling in the first mode.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression to calculate $P_{\\text{cr}}$.\nGiven:\n- $E = 1.2 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n- $I = 3.9 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{4}$\n- $L = 0.160 \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $K = 0.70$\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n$$P_{\\text{cr}} = \\frac{\\pi^2 (1.2 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{Pa}) (3.9 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{4})}{(0.70 \\times 0.160 \\ \\mathrm{m})^2}$$\nFirst, evaluate the numerator:\n$$\\text{Numerator} = \\pi^2 \\times (1.2 \\times 10^{6}) \\times (3.9 \\times 10^{-8}) \\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot m^4} = 0.461897... \\ \\mathrm{N \\cdot m^2}$$\nNext, evaluate the term in the denominator:\n$$(KL)^2 = (0.70 \\times 0.160 \\ \\mathrm{m})^2 = (0.112 \\ \\mathrm{m})^2 = 0.012544 \\ \\mathrm{m^2}$$\nFinally, compute the ratio:\n$$P_{\\text{cr}} = \\frac{0.461897... \\ \\mathrm{N \\cdot m^2}}{0.012544 \\ \\mathrm{m^2}} \\approx 36.8228 \\ \\mathrm{N}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$P_{\\text{cr}} \\approx 36.8 \\ \\mathrm{N}$$\nThis value represents the maximum compressive axial force the idealized erect shaft can withstand before undergoing lateral buckling.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{36.8}$$", "id": "5143696"}]}
