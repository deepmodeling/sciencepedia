Understanding the contribution of each muscle is key to diagnosing the impact of pathologies, such as nerve damage. This advanced problem applies the principles of force and stiffness to a clinical scenario, modeling how the loss of a single muscle—the mylohyoid—affects the complex action of hyoid elevation during swallowing, a critical step in understanding functional anatomy.

The mylohyoid muscle is a suprahyoid muscle forming the muscular floor of the mouth and normally contributes to hyoid elevation during the oral phase of swallowing. In a simplified, quasi-static model of hyoid vertical displacement during the oral phase, assume the following foundational biomechanical facts that are consistent with small-displacement behavior:\n- The net elevating force generated by the suprahyoid muscle group is the vector sum of individual muscle forces, and the vertical displacement of the hyoid, $h$, satisfies a linear elastic relation with the effective vertical stiffness of the suspensory tissues, $k$, namely $F_{\\text{suprahyoid}} = k h$.\n- Immediately after denervation, compensatory changes in activation of remaining muscles are negligible on the timescale of the oral phase, so the force contribution from the mylohyoid drops to $0$.\n\nSuppose that, prior to transection, the total suprahyoid elevating force at peak of the oral phase is $F_{\\text{total}} = 12.0$ N and the effective vertical stiffness is $k = 0.80$ N/mm.
