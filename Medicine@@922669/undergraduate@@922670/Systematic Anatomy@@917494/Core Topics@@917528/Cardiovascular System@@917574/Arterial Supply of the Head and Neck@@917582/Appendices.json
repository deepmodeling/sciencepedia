It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. I will therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation as requested.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, for a steady, fully developed laminar flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid through a rigid cylindrical conduit of radius $r$ and length $L$, driven by a pressure drop $\\Delta P$. The derivation must begin from a radial force balance.\n\nLet the cylindrical coordinate system be $(\\rho, \\phi, z)$, with the $z$-axis aligned with the cylinder's central axis. The flow is in the positive $z$-direction. Due to the axial symmetry and fully developed nature of the flow, the axial velocity $u_z$ is a function of the radial coordinate $\\rho$ only, i.e., $u_z = u_z(\\rho)$.\n\nFirst, consider a cylindrical fluid element of radius $\\rho$ (where $0 \\le \\rho \\le r$) and length $L$. For steady flow, the net force on this element must be zero. The forces acting in the $z$-direction are the pressure forces on the two circular faces and the viscous shear force on the cylindrical surface.\n\nThe pressure force, $F_P$, is the difference between the force on the face at $z=0$ and the face at $z=L$.\n$$ F_P = P(0) \\cdot \\pi\\rho^2 - P(L) \\cdot \\pi\\rho^2 = (P(0) - P(L))\\pi\\rho^2 $$\nWe define the pressure drop over the length $L$ as $\\Delta P = P(0) - P(L)$. For a steady flow, the pressure gradient $\\frac{dP}{dz}$ is constant and can be written as $-\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}$.\nThus, the pressure force is $F_P = \\Delta P \\pi\\rho^2$.\n\nThe viscous shear force, $F_S$, acts on the surface area $A_S = 2\\pi\\rho L$ of the fluid cylinder. The shear stress, $\\tau_{\\rho z}$, is the $z$-component of force acting on a surface with its normal in the $\\rho$-direction. This stress is exerted by the fluid at radial position $\\rho_2 > \\rho$ on the fluid at $\\rho_1 < \\rho$. It opposes the motion of the inner fluid cylinder relative to the outer fluid layers. The total shear force is $F_S = \\tau_{\\rho z} \\cdot (2\\pi\\rho L)$.\n\nThe force balance in the $z$-direction requires the sum of all forces to be zero:\n$$ \\sum F_z = F_P + F_S = 0 $$\n$$ \\Delta P \\pi\\rho^2 + \\tau_{\\rho z} (2\\pi\\rho L) = 0 $$\nSolving for the shear stress $\\tau_{\\rho z}$:\n$$ \\tau_{\\rho z} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2L} \\rho $$\nThis equation shows that the shear stress is a linear function of the radial position, being zero at the centerline ($\\rho=0$) and maximum at the wall ($\\rho=r$).\n\nNext, we use the constitutive relation for a Newtonian fluid, which states that shear stress is proportional to the rate of shear strain (the velocity gradient). For this geometry, the relation is:\n$$ \\tau_{\\rho z} = \\eta \\frac{du_z}{d\\rho} $$\nwhere $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nEquating the two expressions for $\\tau_{\\rho z}$:\n$$ \\eta \\frac{du_z}{d\\rho} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2L} \\rho $$\nTo find the velocity profile $u_z(\\rho)$, we separate variables and integrate with respect to $\\rho$:\n$$ du_z = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta L} \\rho \\, d\\rho $$\n$$ \\int du_z = \\int -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta L} \\rho \\, d\\rho $$\n$$ u_z(\\rho) = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\eta L} \\rho^2 + C $$\nThe integration constant $C$ is determined by the no-slip boundary condition at the cylinder wall, which states that the fluid velocity is zero at the wall, i.e., $u_z(r) = 0$.\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\eta L} r^2 + C \\implies C = \\frac{\\Delta P r^2}{4\\eta L} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $C$ back into the velocity equation gives the parabolic velocity profile:\n$$ u_z(\\rho) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\eta L} (r^2 - \\rho^2) $$\n\nThe volumetric flow rate, $Q$, is found by integrating this velocity profile over the cross-sectional area of the cylinder.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid dynamics, specifically the continuity equation for an incompressible fluid. The provided values are physiologically plausible for the described clinical scenario. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to compute the requested quantity based on the stated assumptions.\n\nThe fundamental principle to be applied is the conservation of volumetric flow rate, $Q$, for an incompressible fluid flowing through a tube of varying cross-sectional area. The problem specifies that we should assume conservation of $Q$ across the stenotic lesion at the instant of peak systole. The volumetric flow rate is given by the product of the cross-sectional area, $A$, and the average fluid velocity, $v$, perpendicular to that area.\n\nLet the subscript $0$ denote the pre-stenotic segment of the Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) and the subscript $s$ denote the segment at the point of maximum stenosis. The given variables are the peak systolic velocities (PSV) in these segments: $v_{0} = 88 \\text{ cm/s}$ and $v_{s} = 352 \\text{ cm/s}$. The cross-sectional areas are $A_{0}$ and $A_{s}$, respectively.\n\nThe principle of conservation of mass, simplified as the continuity equation for an incompressible fluid, states that the volumetric flow rate must be constant along the vessel.\n$$Q_{0} = Q_{s}$$\nSubstituting the expression for flow rate, $Q = A \\cdot v$, we have:\n$$A_{0} v_{0} = A_{s} v_{s}$$\nThis equation relates the areas and velocities in the two segments. The problem asks for the area stenosis fraction, $\\alpha$, which is defined as:\n$$\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{A_{s}}{A_{0}}$$\nTo compute $\\alpha$, we first need to find the ratio of the areas, $\\frac{A_{s}}{A_{0}}$. We can rearrange the continuity equation to solve for this ratio:\n$$\\frac{A_{s}}{A_{0}} = \\frac{v_{0}}{v_{s}}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression back into the definition of the area stenosis fraction $\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{v_{0}}{v_{s}}$$\nUsing the provided numerical values for the velocities:\n$$v_{0} = 88 \\text{ cm/s}$$\n$$v_{s} = 352 \\text{ cm/s}$$\nWe can calculate the value of $\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{88}{352}$$\nThe ratio of the velocities is:\n$$\\frac{88}{352} = \\frac{88}{4 \\times 88} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$$\nTherefore, the area stenosis fraction is:\n$$\\alpha = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, we express the result as $0.7500$. This value corresponds to a $75\\%$ reduction in the cross-sectional area of the artery at the site of the stenosis.\n\nFor completeness, we consider the additional clinical context provided. The stenotic peak systolic velocity is $v_{s} = 352 \\text{ cm/s}$, which is significantly greater than the widely accepted threshold of $230 \\text{ cm/s}$ used to suggest a hemodynamically severe stenosis (often correlated with a diameter stenosis greater than $0.70$).\n\nFurthermore, we can calculate the ICA-to-CCA PSV ratio:\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{v_{s}}{v_{\\text{CCA}}} = \\frac{352 \\text{ cm/s}}{72 \\text{ cm/s}} \\approx 4.889$$\nThis ratio is substantially greater than the threshold of $4.0$, which also strongly indicates a severe stenosis (greater than $0.70$ diameter stenosis).\n\nIt is important to note that the simplified continuity equation used for this calculation relates a $0.75$ area stenosis to a $0.50$ diameter stenosis (since $\\alpha = 1 - (1-\\delta)^2 \\implies \\delta = 1 - \\sqrt{1-\\alpha} = 1 - \\sqrt{1-0.75} = 0.5$, where $\\delta$ is diameter stenosis). This apparent discrepancy with the empirical Doppler criteria (which suggest a $>0.70$ diameter stenosis for these velocities) highlights the limitations of the ideal fluid model. The model neglects energy losses due to viscosity and turbulence, which are significant in high-grade stenosis and are implicitly accounted for in the empirically derived clinical velocity thresholds.\n\nGiven the strong suggestion of a high-grade, hemodynamically significant stenosis based on the duplex ultrasound findings (both absolute PSV and ICA/CCA ratio), a confirmatory imaging study is clinically warranted to provide precise anatomical detail for potential intervention (e.g., carotid endarterectomy or stenting). The most appropriate and commonly used non-invasive modality for this purpose is CT Angiography (CTA) of the neck.

The zone with the lower distal terminal pressure is considered more vulnerable. The task is to calculate the distal terminal pressures for the ACA, MCA, and PCA territories during the hypotensive state.\n\nThe fundamental relationship is the pressure drop, $\\Delta P_i$, across the resistance, $R_i$, for a given flow, $Q_i$:\n$$ \\Delta P_i = Q_i \\cdot R_i $$\nThe distal terminal pressure, $P_{\\text{distal}, i}$, is then:\n$$ P_{\\text{distal}, i} = P_{\\text{in}} - \\Delta P_i = P_{\\text{in}} - (Q_i \\cdot R_i) $$\nThe problem states that \"flows scale proportionally with proximal driving pressure.\" The most appropriate interpretation of \"proximal driving pressure\" is the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), defined as $P_{\\text{CPP}} = P_{\\text{MAP}} - P_{\\text{venous}}$. This is the effective pressure gradient driving blood flow through the brain.\n\n1.  **Calculate the CPP for both states:**\n    - Initial CPP: $P_{\\text{CPP, initial}} = P_{\\text{MAP, initial}} - P_{\\text{venous}} = 90\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} - 10\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} = 80\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n    - Hypotensive CPP: $P_{\\text{CPP, hypo}} = P_{\\text{MAP, hypotensive}} - P_{\\text{venous}} = 60\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} - 10\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} = 50\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the flows during hypotension.**\n    The assumption of proportional scaling means that the flow in any territory $i$ during hypotension, $Q'_{i}$, is related to its initial flow, $Q_i$, by the ratio of the CPPs.

Therefore, the ACA–MCA cortical watershed is more vulnerable to ischemia.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The ACA–MCA cortical watershed is more vulnerable than the MCA–PCA watershed, because the minimum adjacent terminal branch pressure at the ACA–MCA border is lower during hypotension.**\nThis assertion matches the result of the derivation. The calculated minimum adjacent pressure for the ACA-MCA zone ($36.625\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$) is lower than that for the MCA-PCA zone ($37.3125\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$). The reasoning that lower pressure implies greater vulnerability is correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The MCA–PCA cortical watershed is more vulnerable than the MCA–PCA watershed, because posterior circulation branches have higher distal resistance and thus lower terminal pressures during hypotension.**\nThis assertion that the MCA-PCA watershed is more vulnerable is contrary to the calculated result. The reasoning provided is also flawed. The resistance of the PCA ($R_{\\mathrm{PCA}} = 120\\,\\mathrm{mmHg\\cdot min/L}$) is not the highest; the ACA's is higher ($R_{\\mathrm{ACA}} = 170\\,\\mathrm{mmHg\\cdot min/L}$). Furthermore, the PCA territory was calculated to have the *highest* terminal pressure ($45.0\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$), not the lowest.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Both cortical watershed zones have equal vulnerability during hypotension, because distal pressures equalize via the Circle of Willis.**\nThis assertion is contradicted by the calculations, which show unequal distal pressures: $P'_{\\text{distal, ACA}} \\approx 36.6\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, $P'_{\\text{distal, MCA}} \\approx 37.3\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, and $P'_{\\text{distal, PCA}} = 45.0\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$. The reasoning is also incorrect; the Circle of Willis primarily equalizes proximal inflow pressures (an assumption already included in the problem setup), not distal terminal branch pressures.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Neither cortical watershed zone is preferentially affected during hypotension; only deep perforator territories are vulnerable.**\nWhile deep perforating arteries are indeed highly vulnerable to hypotension in a real clinical scenario, this option introduces information external to the provided model and problem scope. The question explicitly demands a comparison between the ACA–MCA and MCA–PCA watershed zones based *only* on the supplied parameters. The calculations demonstrate a clear preferential vulnerability within the model's framework.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5083266"}]}
