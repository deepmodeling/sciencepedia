It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid dynamics (Hagen-Poiseuille flow), a standard and appropriate model for this type of analysis. The parameters provided are physically realistic for human anatomy. The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and objective, with a clear path to a unique solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires starting from the standard relation for laminar flow in a circular tube, which is the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. This equation relates the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, to the pressure drop, $\\Delta P$, along a tube of length $L$ and radius $r$, for a fluid with dynamic viscosity $\\eta$. The equation is:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\n\nHydraulic resistance, $R$, is defined by analogy to Ohm's law for electrical circuits, as the ratio of the driving pressure drop to the resulting flow rate:\n$$\\Delta P = Q R$$\nBy rearranging the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to solve for $\\Delta P$, we get:\n$$\\Delta P = Q \\left( \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4} \\right)$$\nComparing this with the definition of hydraulic resistance, we can identify the expression for $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4}$$\nThis equation shows that for a tube of a given length, the hydraulic resistance is inversely proportional to the fourth power of its radius ($R \\propto r^{-4}$).\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the hydraulic resistance of the anterior tibial vein, $R_{\\text{ant}}$, to that of the posterior tibial vein, $R_{\\text{post}}$. Using the derived formula for $R$, we can write the resistances for each vein:\n$$R_{\\text{ant}} = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r_{\\text{ant}}^4}$$\n$$R_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r_{\\text{post}}^4}$$\nThe problem states that the length $L$ and the blood viscosity $\\eta$ are the same for both segments. The constants $8$ and $\\pi$ are also common to both expressions. Therefore, when we compute the ratio $R_{\\text{ant}}/R_{\\text{post}}$, these terms will cancel out:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\text{ant}}}{R_{\\text{post}}} = \\frac{\\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r_{\\text{ant}}^4}}{\\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r_{\\text{post}}^4}} = \\frac{r_{\\text{post}}^4}{r_{\\text{ant}}^4} = \\left( \\frac{r_{\\text{post}}}{r_{\\text{ant}}} \\right)^4$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values for the radii: $r_{\\text{ant}} = 2.5 \\, \\text{mm}$ and $r_{\\text{post}} = 3.0 \\, \\text{mm}$. Since we are calculating a ratio, the units of the radii (mm) will cancel, and no conversion to SI units is necessary.\n$$\\frac{R_{\\text{ant}}}{R_{\\text{post}}} = \\left( \\frac{3.0}{2.5} \\right)^4 = (1.2)^4$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$(1.2)^4 = 1.2 \\times 1.2 \\times 1.2 \\times 1.2 = 1.44 \\times 1.44 = 2.0736$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure of $2.0736$ is $6$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$\\frac{R_{\\text{ant}}}{R_{\\text{post}}} \\approx 2.074$$\n\nFinally, we address the question of which vein is more susceptible to stasis. Stasis refers to a condition of low or zero blood flow. From the definition of hydraulic resistance, the flow rate is given by $Q = \\Delta P / R$. The problem asks to consider an equal driving pressure gradient for both veins. Since the lengths $L$ are equal, an equal pressure gradient ($\\Delta P/L$) implies an equal pressure drop ($\\Delta P$) across the segments. Under this condition, the flow rate $Q$ is inversely proportional to the resistance $R$ ($Q \\propto 1/R$).\n\nSince we calculated that $R_{\\text{ant}}/R_{\\text{post}} \\approx 2.074 > 1$, it follows that $R_{\\text{ant}} > R_{\\text{post}}$. A higher resistance leads to a lower flow rate for the same driving pressure. Consequently, the anterior tibial vein will have a lower blood flow rate compared to the posterior tibial vein. This reduced flow (stasis) increases the risk of thrombus formation. Therefore, the anterior tibial vein, with its smaller radius and higher resistance, is more susceptible to stasis and thrombosis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.074}$$", "id": "5157358"}, {"introduction": "The return of venous blood from the lower limbs to the heart must overcome the force of gravity, a feat accomplished largely by the calf muscle pump.
