This exercise is fundamental for public health planning and understanding the population-level impact of anatomical variations.", "problem": "A cohort study is designed to investigate symptomatic consequences of the anatomical variation known as aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA). Dysphagia lusoria is a clinical presentation that occurs when the esophagus is compressed by this vessel. Assume the following foundational facts:\n\n- Prevalence is defined as the proportion of individuals in a population who have a specified anatomical variation at a given time. Let the prevalence of aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA) in the general population be $p(A) = 0.007$.\n- Symptom penetrance is defined as the conditional probability that an individual expressing a given anatomical variation exhibits a particular clinical symptom. Let the penetrance of dysphagia lusoria among individuals with ARSA be $p(D \\mid A) = 0.10$.\n- The expected count in a cohort of size $N$ is the sum of expectations over independent Bernoulli trials, where each individual is modeled to have probability $p(D)$ of being symptomatic.

Provide the final answer as an exact number of individuals (no rounding).", "solution": "The problem asks for the expected number of individuals in a cohort of a specified size who will present with dysphagia lusoria attributable to an aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA). This is a problem in elementary probability and biostatistics.\n\nFirst, we define the events as follows:\n- Let $A$ be the event that a randomly selected individual from the general population has an aberrant right subclavian artery.\n- Let $D$ be the event that a randomly selected individual has dysphagia lusoria due to ARSA.\n\nThe problem provides the following probabilities:\n1. The prevalence of ARSA, which is the probability of event $A$: $p(A) = 0.007$.\n2. The symptom penetrance, which is the conditional probability of having dysphagia lusoria given the presence of ARSA: $p(D \\mid A) = 0.10$.\n\nThe problem states to assume that dysphagia lusoria in this model arises only via ARSA. This simplifies the calculation of the overall probability of an individual having dysphagia lusoria. The event $D$ is effectively the intersection of the event that an individual has ARSA and the event that they are symptomatic given they have ARSA. In probabilistic terms, the probability of a randomly selected individual having dysphagia lusoria, $p(D)$, is given by the product of the probability of having ARSA and the conditional probability of being symptomatic given ARSA. This is consistent with the definition of conditional probability, $p(D \\cap A) = p(D \\mid A) \\, p(A)$. Since the problem specifies that $D$ only occurs via $A$, the event $D$ is equivalent to the event $D \\cap A$. Therefore, we have:\n$$p(D) = p(D \\cap A) = p(D \\mid A) \\, p(A)$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$p(D) = 0.10 \\times 0.007 = 0.0007$$\nThis value, $p(D) = 0.0007$, represents the probability that any single individual selected at random from the population will have dysphagia lusoria attributable to ARSA.\n\nNext, we consider a cohort of size $N = 10{,}000$. We want to find the expected number of individuals in this cohort who exhibit the condition. We can model the status of each individual in the cohort as an independent Bernoulli trial. Let $X_i$ be a random variable for the $i$-th individual, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $N$. We define $X_i = 1$ if the individual has dysphagia lusoria (with probability $p(D)$) and $X_i = 0$ if they do not (with probability $1 - p(D)$).\n\nThe expected value of a single Bernoulli trial, $E[X_i]$, is given by:\n$$E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot p(D) + 0 \\cdot (1 - p(D)) = p(D)$$\n\nThe total number of individuals with the condition in the cohort is the sum of these random variables: $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$. By the linearity of expectation, the expected value of this sum is the sum of the individual expected values:\n$$E[S] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]$$\n\nSince each trial is identical, $E[X_i] = p(D)$ for all $i$. Thus, we have:\n$$E[S] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p(D) = N \\cdot p(D)$$\nThis formula corresponds to the mean (expected value) of a binomial distribution with parameters $N$ (number of trials) and $p$ (probability of success).\n\nNow, we substitute the known values for $N$ and $p(D)$ into this equation:\n$$E[S] = 10{,}000 \\times 0.0007$$\n$$E[S] = 10^{4} \\times (7 \\times 10^{-4})$$\n$$E[S] = 7$$\n\nTherefore, the expected number of individuals in a cohort of $10{,}000$ who will have dysphagia lusoria attributable to ARSA is $7$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{7}\n$$", "id": "5164128"}, {"introduction": "Moving from population estimates to individual diagnosis, this exercise demonstrates how to quantitatively update clinical suspicion using diagnostic evidence.

The pre-test probability of ARSA, which is the prior probability of the condition, is $P(\\text{ARSA}) = 0.008$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the CT sign for detecting ARSA is $0.92$.\n3.  The specificity of the CT sign for detecting ARSA is $0.95$.\nThe problem asks to compute the posterior probability of ARSA given a positive CT sign, rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, using established principles of medical diagnostics and probability theory (Bayes' theorem). The terms sensitivity, specificity, and prior/posterior probability are standard in this field. The data provided are self-contained, consistent, and plausible. The problem is well-posed and objective, with a clear, unique solution path. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nTo solve the problem, we define the following events:\n-   Let $A$ be the event that the patient has ARSA.\n-   Let $A^c$ be the event that the patient does not have ARSA.\n-   Let $T^+$ be the event that the CT scan shows a positive sign for ARSA.\n-   Let $T^-$ be the event that the CT scan shows a negative sign for ARSA.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we can formalize the given probabilities:\n1.  The prior probability of having ARSA is $P(A) = 0.008$.\n2.  The prior probability of not having ARSA is the complement: $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.008 = 0.992$.\n3.  The sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the condition. This is the true positive rate: $P(T^+ | A) = 0.92$.\n4.  The specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the condition. This is the true negative rate: $P(T^- | A^c) = 0.95$.\n\nWe need to compute the posterior probability of having ARSA given a positive test result, which is denoted as $P(A | T^+)$. We use Bayes' theorem for this purpose:\n$$ P(A | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | A) P(A)}{P(T^+)} $$\n\nThe numerator, $P(T^+ | A) P(A)$, is the probability of having ARSA and testing positive (a true positive).\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, which considers both true positives and false positives:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ | A) P(A) + P(T^+ | A^c) P(A^c) $$\n\nTo evaluate this expression, we need $P(T^+ | A^c)$, which is the probability of a positive test given the patient does not have ARSA. This is the false positive rate. It is the complement of the specificity (the true negative rate):\n$$ P(T^+ | A^c) = 1 - P(T^- | A^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 $$\n\nNow we can calculate the components for Bayes' theorem.\nThe probability of a true positive result is:\n$$ P(T^+ \\cap A) = P(T^+ | A) P(A) = (0.92)(0.008) = 0.00736 $$\n\nThe probability of a false positive result is:\n$$ P(T^+ \\cap A^c) = P(T^+ | A^c) P(A^c) = (0.05)(0.992) = 0.0496 $$\n\nThe total probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$, is the sum of the probabilities of a true positive and a false positive:\n$$ P(T^+) = 0.00736 + 0.0496 = 0.05696 $$\n\nFinally, we substitute these values into Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability $P(A | T^+)$:\n$$ P(A | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | A) P(A)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{0.00736}{0.05696} $$\n\nPerforming the division:\n$$ P(A | T^+) \\approx 0.129213483... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of static mechanics applied to biomechanics, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objective in its formulation. The model, though simplified, is a standard and appropriate representation for analyzing wall tension in thin-walled pressure vessels such as arteries and aneurysmal diverticula.\n\nThe central task is to derive the circumferential wall tension per unit length, often denoted as hoop tension, for a thin-walled cylinder. Let the inner radius of the cylindrical vessel be $r$ and its length be $L$. The vessel is subjected to a uniform internal transmural pressure $P$. We are instructed to use a free-body equilibrium argument on a segment that has been longitudinally bisected.\n\nConsider a semicylindrical segment of length $L$. We analyze the forces acting on this half-cylinder in the direction perpendicular to the cutting plane.\nThere are two primary forces to consider for equilibrium:\n$1$. The force exerted by the internal pressure $P$ on the inner surface of the semicylinder. This force tends to push the semicylindrical segment outwards.\n$2$. The tensile forces within the wall of the vessel at the two edges where the cylinder was cut. These forces hold the segment together, counteracting the pressure force.\n\nLet us calculate the total force due to pressure, $F_P$. The pressure $P$ acts normally (perpendicularly) to the curved inner surface. To find the net force pushing the two halves apart, we can integrate the component of the pressure force that is perpendicular to the cutting plane over the entire inner surface area of the semicylinder. A more direct method is to consider the force on the projected area. The projected area of the internal curved surface onto the cutting plane is a rectangle with dimensions $2r$ (the diameter) and $L$ (the length). The net force due to pressure acting to separate the two halves is the pressure multiplied by this projected area.\n$$F_P = P \\times (\\text{Projected Area}) = P \\times (2r \\times L) = 2PrL$$\n\nNext, let us calculate the total tensile force, $F_T$, that resists this separation. The problem defines the circumferential wall tension per unit length as $T$. This tension acts along the thickness of the wall at the cut surfaces. Since the bisection creates two such cut surfaces, each of length $L$, the total tensile force pulling the half-cylinder together is the tension per unit length, $T$, multiplied by the total length of the cut edges.\n$$F_T = T \\times L + T \\times L = 2TL$$\n\nFor the vessel to be in static equilibrium, the outward force due to pressure must be exactly balanced by the inward tensile force from the vessel wall. Therefore, we set $F_P = F_T$.\n$$2PrL = 2TL$$\nWe can divide both sides of the equation by $2L$ (since $L$ is a finite, non-zero length).\n$$T = Pr$$\nThis is the derived expression for the circumferential wall tension per unit length as a function of the transmural pressure $P$ and the inner radius $r$. This result is a specific form of the Law of Laplace for a cylindrical geometry.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires us to find the ratio of the circumferential wall tensions in an aberrant subclavian artery with a Kommerell's diverticulum (radius $r_d$) to that of a normal ostium (radius $r_n$). The systolic pressure $P$ is stated to be the same for both cases.\n\nLet $T_d$ be the tension in the diverticulum wall and $T_n$ be the tension in the normal ostium wall. Using the formula we just derived:\nFor the Kommerell's diverticulum:\n$$T_d = P r_d$$\nFor the normal ostium:\n$$T_n = P r_n$$\n\nThe ratio of the tensions is therefore:\n$$\\frac{T_d}{T_n} = \\frac{P r_d}{P r_n}$$\nSince the pressure $P$ is identical in the numerator and denominator, it cancels out, leaving:\n$$\\frac{T_d}{T_n} = \\frac{r_d}{r_n}$$\nThis shows that for a given pressure, the wall tension is directly proportional to the radius of the vessel.\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the numerical value of this ratio using the provided imaging-derived values: $r_d = 12\\ \\text{mm}$ and $r_n = 5\\ \\text{mm}$.\nSubstituting these values into our expression for the ratio:\n$$\\frac{T_d}{T_n} = \\frac{12\\ \\text{mm}}{5\\ \\text{mm}}$$\nThe units of millimeters ($\\text{mm}$) cancel out, resulting in a dimensionless ratio.\n$$\\frac{T_d}{T_n} = \\frac{12}{5} = 2.4$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $2.4$ can be expressed as $2.40$ to reflect this precision.
