In primary position, the SR’s muscle plane is rotated temporally by an angle $\\phi$ from the orbital sagittal plane; take the well-established anatomical value $\\phi = 23^{\\circ}$. Assume the following modeling assumptions:\n- The globe is a sphere with orthogonal globe-fixed axes: the lateral axis $\\mathbf{x'}$ (positive to the subject’s right), the vertical axis $\\mathbf{y'}$ (positive superiorly), and the visual axis $\\mathbf{z'}$ (positive anteriorly).\n- Primary gaze aligns the globe-fixed axes with the orbital axes $(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{z})$.\n- Abduction by an angle $\\theta$ rotates the globe about the superior–inferior axis $\\mathbf{y}$, so that the globe-fixed axes are rotated relative to the orbital axes by that angle.\n- The SR force vector lies in the SR muscle plane, which, in primary position, contains $\\mathbf{y}$ and is rotated temporally by $\\phi$ about $\\mathbf{y}$ relative to the orbital sagittal plane.\n\nUsing only rigid-body rotation and vector resolution, start from these definitions and decompose the SR force vector relative to the globe-fixed axes after abduction by $\\theta$.

It is a standard problem in the biomechanics of ocular motility, based on a simplified but established model (Fick's axes). The provided data are sufficient and consistent for deriving a unique solution.\n\nThe goal is to find the abduction angle $\\theta$ at which the superior rectus (SR) muscle acts as a pure elevator. The condition for pure elevation is explicitly defined in the problem as having a zero force component along the globe's lateral axis ($\\mathbf{x'}$) and generating no torsion about the globe's visual axis ($\\mathbf{z'}$).\n\nFirst, we establish the coordinate systems.\nThe fixed orbital coordinate system is $O = (\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{z})$, where $\\mathbf{x}$ is lateral, $\\mathbf{y}$ is superior, and $\\mathbf{z}$ is anterior.\nThe globe-fixed coordinate system is $O' = (\\mathbf{x'}, \\mathbf{y'}, \\mathbf{z'})$, which is aligned with $O$ in the primary position.\n\nNext, we determine the vector representing the force of the SR muscle, $\\mathbf{F}_{SR}$, in the orbital frame. The problem states that the SR's muscle plane contains the vertical axis $\\mathbf{y}$ and is rotated temporally (laterally, towards positive $\\mathbf{x}$) by an angle $\\phi = 23^{\\circ}$ from the orbital sagittal plane (the $\\mathbf{y}$-$\\mathbf{z}$ plane). The SR muscle pulls the eye superiorly (positive $\\mathbf{y}$ component), posteriorly (negative $\\mathbf{z}$ component), and medially (negative $\\mathbf{x}$ component, causing adduction).\n\nLet us define a unit vector $\\mathbf{u}_{SR}$ in the direction of the SR force. This vector lies in the specified muscle plane. Let $\\gamma$ be the angle the muscle's line of action makes with the horizontal ($\\mathbf{x}$-$\\mathbf{z}$) plane. The force vector has a vertical component proportional to $\\sin\\gamma$ and a horizontal projection proportional to $\\cos\\gamma$. The horizontal projection is oriented posteriorly and medially. The direction of this projection is obtained by rotating the posterior direction vector $(-\\mathbf{z})$ by the angle $\\phi$ about the $\\mathbf{y}$-axis towards the medial (negative $\\mathbf{x}$) side. This corresponds to a direction vector in the $\\mathbf{x}$-$\\mathbf{z}$ plane of $(-\\sin\\phi, 0, -\\cos\\phi)$.\n\nCombining the vertical and horizontal components, the unit vector for the SR force in the orbital frame is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}_{SR} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\cos\\gamma \\sin\\phi \\\\ \\sin\\gamma \\\\ -\\cos\\gamma \\cos\\phi \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe force vector is $\\mathbf{F}_{SR} = F \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_{SR}$, where $F$ is the magnitude of the force.\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{SR} = F \\begin{pmatrix} -\\cos\\gamma \\sin\\phi \\\\ \\sin\\gamma \\\\ -\\cos\\gamma \\cos\\phi \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNote that the parameter $\\gamma$ is not given, but as we will see, it does not affect the final result.\n\nThe globe is abducted by an angle $\\theta$. This corresponds to a rotation of the globe-fixed frame $O'$ with respect to the orbital frame $O$ by an angle $\\theta$ about the common $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{y'}$ axis.

This practice focuses on the superior oblique, a critical muscle for downward and torsional eye movements, whose function is often misunderstood.

Mastering this geometric relationship is essential for interpreting clinical tests for superior oblique palsy.", "problem": "A simplified biomechanical model of the Superior Oblique muscle considers its effective line of action to lie in a fixed “oblique muscle plane” determined by its trochlear pulley and posterior-lateral insertion relative to the globe. In primary gaze, the globe’s visual axis is taken as the anterior direction, and the globe-fixed axes are defined as follows: the horizontal axis $\\hat{x}$ points temporally, the vertical axis $\\hat{y}$ points superiorly, and the visual axis $\\hat{z}$ points anteriorly. Horizontal rotations (adduction and abduction) about the vertical axis $\\hat{y}$ are parameterized by an angle $\\theta$, where positive $\\theta$ denotes adduction.\n\nUse the following foundational facts and definitions:\n\n- The “vertical component” of a muscle’s action on the globe refers to the component that produces rotation about the globe’s horizontal axis $\\hat{x}$ (i.e., depression/elevation), and its magnitude in a given horizontal eye position is proportional to the projection of the muscle’s effective line-of-action plane onto the globe’s vertical meridian plane.\n- The magnitude of the projection of one direction onto another equals the cosine of the angle between the two directions.\n- The Superior Oblique’s functional plane has a fixed azimuthal orientation in the orbit relative to the globe’s visual axis in primary position: in well-established anatomical measurements, the oblique muscle plane is inclined by an angle $\\alpha = 51^{\\circ}$ from the globe’s visual axis, toward the nasal side, when referenced in the horizontal (transverse) plane.\n- When the eye adducts by $\\theta$ (rotation about $\\hat{y}$), the globe’s vertical meridian plane rotates in the horizontal plane by $\\theta$ relative to its primary position orientation.\n\nStarting strictly from these principles, model the alignment between the Superior Oblique’s oblique muscle plane and the globe’s vertical meridian plane in adduction as a function of $\\theta$.

The solution will be derived by modeling the geometry of the eye and muscle action as described.\n\nFirst, we establish a geometric framework in the horizontal (transverse) plane, which contains the globe's horizontal axis $\\hat{x}$ and visual axis $\\hat{z}$ in primary gaze. Let us define a fixed orbital coordinate system with axes $\\hat{X}$ (temporal), $\\hat{Y}$ (superior), and $\\hat{Z}$ (anterior). The analysis can be simplified by considering the orientation of the relevant planes as defined by direction vectors in the horizontal ($\\hat{X}$-$\\hat{Z}$) plane.\n\nThe problem states that the vertical component's magnitude is proportional to the projection of the muscle's plane onto the globe's vertical meridian plane. It further simplifies this by stating that the magnitude of such a projection is related to the cosine of the angle between two \"directions\". We identify these two critical directions in the horizontal plane:\n$1$. The direction representing the SO muscle's effective line of action.\n$2$. The direction representing the orientation of the globe's vertical meridian plane, which is defined by the visual axis.\n\nLet's define these directions using unit vectors in the orbital $\\hat{X}$-$\\hat{Z}$ plane. We will measure angles from the anterior direction ($\\hat{Z}$), with positive angles representing rotation toward the nasal side (the $-\\hat{X}$ direction).\n\nThe problem specifies that the SO's functional plane is fixed in the orbit and \"is inclined by an angle $\\alpha = 51^{\\circ}$ from the globe’s visual axis, toward the nasal side,\" when the eye is in primary position. In primary position, the visual axis is aligned with the orbital $\\hat{Z}$ axis. Therefore, the direction of the SO muscle's action in the horizontal plane is fixed at an angle $\\alpha$ from the $\\hat{Z}$ axis, pointed nasally. Let $\\vec{u}_{SO}$ be the unit vector representing this direction. In the $(\\hat{X}, \\hat{Z})$ basis, this vector can be written as:\n$$ \\vec{u}_{SO} = -\\sin(\\alpha) \\hat{X} + \\cos(\\alpha) \\hat{Z} $$\nThis vector is constant with respect to the orbit.\n\nNext, we consider the globe's vertical meridian plane. This plane contains the visual axis $\\hat{z}$ and the vertical axis $\\hat{y}$. Its orientation in the horizontal plane is determined by the direction of the visual axis. The problem states that when the eye adducts by an angle $\\theta$, the vertical meridian plane rotates by $\\theta$ from its primary position. Since positive $\\theta$ denotes adduction (a nasalward rotation), the visual axis $\\hat{z}$ rotates by an angle $\\theta$ from the orbital $\\hat{Z}$ axis toward the nasal side ($-\\hat{X}$).

This vector is given by:\n$$ \\vec{u}_{vis}(\\theta) = -\\sin(\\theta) \\hat{X} + \\cos(\\theta) \\hat{Z} $$\n\nThe problem states that the magnitude of the vertical component of the SO's action, let's call it $M_v$, is proportional to the cosine of the angle between these two directions. The cosine of the angle between two unit vectors is given by their dot product. Let $\\phi$ be the angle between $\\vec{u}_{SO}$ and $\\vec{u}_{vis}(\\theta)$.\n$$ M_v(\\theta) \\propto \\cos(\\phi) = \\vec{u}_{SO} \\cdot \\vec{u}_{vis}(\\theta) $$\nLet's compute the dot product:\n$$ \\vec{u}_{SO} \\cdot \\vec{u}_{vis}(\\theta) = (-\\sin(\\alpha))(-\\sin(\\theta)) + (\\cos(\\alpha))(\\cos(\\theta)) $$\n$$ \\vec{u}_{SO} \\cdot \\vec{u}_{vis}(\\theta) = \\cos(\\alpha)\\cos(\\theta) + \\sin(\\alpha)\\sin(\\theta) $$\nUsing the trigonometric identity for the cosine of a difference, we get:\n$$ \\cos(\\phi) = \\cos(\\alpha - \\theta) $$\nSo, the magnitude of the vertical component is a function of $\\theta$:\n$$ M_v(\\theta) = k \\cos(\\alpha - \\theta) $$\nwhere $k$ is a positive constant of proportionality.\n\nWe are asked to find the adduction angle $\\theta^{\\star}$ that maximizes this magnitude. The \"pure depression condition\" implies finding the maximum depressor action. The SO muscle is a depressor, so its vertical action component is maximized when the term $\\cos(\\alpha - \\theta)$ is at its maximum positive value. The maximum value of the cosine function is $1$, which occurs when its argument is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$. We are looking for a physically realistic angle, so we set the argument to zero.\n$$ \\alpha - \\theta^{\\star} = 0 $$\nThis yields:\n$$ \\theta^{\\star} = \\alpha $$\n\nThis result has a clear physical interpretation: the SO muscle's vertical action is maximal when the eye is adducted by an amount that aligns the globe's vertical meridian plane (sagittal plane) with the fixed plane of action of the SO muscle.\n\nThe problem provides the value $\\alpha = 51^{\\circ}$. Therefore, the adduction angle for maximal depression is:\n$$ \\theta^{\\star} = 51^{\\circ} $$\nThe question asks for the result to be expressed in degrees and rounded to two significant figures.
