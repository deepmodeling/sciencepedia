The widely accepted physiological bases are that ABR waves arise from serially ordered neural generators (wave I from the distal cochlear division of the vestibulocochlear nerve, wave III from lower pontine relays such as the superior olivary complex, and wave V from rostral brainstem pathways such as the lateral lemniscus and inferior colliculus), and that conduction times across serial segments add linearly. Consequently, for interpeak latencies, the latency between wave I and wave V equals the sum of the latencies between wave I and wave III and between wave III and wave V.\n\nA patient’s ABR, compared to age-matched normative values, shows an interpeak latency prolongation of wave I–III by $0.5$ milliseconds and wave I–V by $1.2$ milliseconds.
