A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Characteristic Frequency Map $f(x)$**\n\nThe problem states that the local resonant frequency $f(x)$ of the basilar membrane is governed by the resonance of a mass–spring system. The resonant angular frequency, $\\omega$, of a simple harmonic oscillator with stiffness $k$ and mass $m$ is given by:\n$$ \\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} $$\nThe frequency $f$ is related to the angular frequency $\\omega$ by $f = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}$. Therefore, the resonant frequency is:\n$$ f = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} $$\nIn this model, the relevant quantities are the stiffness per unit area, $K(x)$, and the mass per unit area, $m$. The same resonance relationship applies to these local densities. Thus, the local resonant frequency at position $x$ along the basilar membrane is:\n$$ f(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{K(x)}{m}} $$\nWe are given the explicit functional form for the stiffness:\n$$ K(x) = K_{0}\\exp(-2\\alpha x) $$\nwhere $K_{0}$ is the stiffness at the base ($x=0$), and $\\alpha$ is a positive constant describing the exponential decay rate. The mass per unit area, $m$, is assumed to be constant. Substituting the expression for $K(x)$ into the equation for $f(x)$:\n$$ f(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{K_{0}\\exp(-2\\alpha x)}{m}} $$\nWe can separate the terms inside the square root:\n$$ f(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{K_{0}}{m}} \\sqrt{\\exp(-2\\alpha x)} $$\nThe square root of the exponential term simplifies as follows:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\exp(-2\\alpha x)} = \\left( \\exp(-2\\alpha x) \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\alpha x}{2}\\right) = \\exp(-\\alpha x) $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $f(x)$:\n$$ f(x) = \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{K_{0}}{m}} \\right) \\exp(-\\alpha x) $$\nNow, we use the given condition for the characteristic frequency at the base, $f_{0}$, which corresponds to the frequency at $x=0$.\n$$ f_{0} = f(0) $$\nEvaluating our expression for $f(x)$ at $x=0$:\n$$ f(0) = \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{K_{0}}{m}} \\right) \\exp(-\\alpha \\cdot 0) = \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{K_{0}}{m}} \\right) \\cdot 1 $$\nTherefore, the term in the parenthesis is equal to $f_{0}$:\n$$ f_{0} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{K_{0}}{m}} $$\nSubstituting $f_{0}$ back into the general equation for $f(x)$, we obtain the desired expression for the characteristic frequency map:\n$$ f(x) = f_{0}\\exp(-\\alpha x) $$\nThis expression, often referred to as the Greenwood function, describes how the characteristic frequency decreases exponentially from the base to the apex of the cochlea.\n\n**Calculation of the Characteristic Frequency**\n\nNow, we use the derived formula to calculate the frequency at the specified position. We are given:\n- Position: $x = 12\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Base frequency: $f_{0} = 20\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$\n- Decay constant: $\\alpha = 0.12\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless exponent $\\alpha x$:\n$$ \\alpha x = (0.12\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-1}) \\times (12\\,\\mathrm{mm}) = 1.44 $$\nNow substitute the values into the frequency map equation.

Approximate the canal lumen centerline as a circular arc of radius $R$ that lies in a fixed plane of the temporal bone.

Gravity is a constant vector $\\vec{g}$ of magnitude $g$ pointing inferiorly in the laboratory frame. During a right Dix–Hallpike maneuver, the head is first turned by $45^\\circ$ to the right and then extended by $30^\\circ$ into the supine head-hanging position, which places the right posterior canal plane close to a gravity-dependent orientation. Immediately after reaching the final position, assume the particle is free to move with negligible friction along the arc and entrains endolymph with it (drag-dominated transient), and that the cupula behaves as a compliant partition at the ampulla.\n\nUsing only the component of the gravitational force along the canal arc and the known excitatory–inhibitory polarity of the vertical semicircular canals, reason through the following steps for the right posterior canal: (i) the initial direction of otoconial motion (ampullopetal versus ampullofugal), based on the sign of $m\\vec{g}\\cdot \\hat{t}$; (ii) the resultant direction of endolymph flow at the ampulla relative to the ampulla (ampullopetal versus ampullofugal); (iii) whether this flow excites or inhibits posterior canal afferents; and (iv) the dominant nystagmus fast-phase direction, including the torsional component, produced by the vestibulo-ocular reflex.

The solution requires a step-by-step analysis of the physics and physiology.\n\n1.  **Step (i): Direction of Otoconial Motion.** The right Dix-Hallpike maneuver places the head in a position that aligns the R-PSCC plane vertically with respect to gravity. The otoconia, located in the long (non-ampullated) arm, are now in the most superior part of the canal arc. Under the force of gravity, $\\vec{F}_g = m\\vec{g}$, they will sink along the canal arc. This direction of motion is away from the ampulla and toward the common crus. This is, by definition, an **ampullofugal** motion. The tangential force component along the canal, $m\\vec{g}\\cdot \\hat{t}$, is positive, driving this motion.\n\n2.  **Step (ii): Direction of Endolymph Flow.** In canalithiasis, the sinking otoconia act like a piston, displacing and entraining the endolymph. As the particles move ampullofugally, they cause a bulk flow of endolymph that is also **ampullofugal**. This fluid movement deflects the cupula at the ampulla.\n\n3.  **Step (iii): Excitatory vs. Inhibitory Flow.** This step is governed by Ewald's Laws. For the vertical semicircular canals (anterior and posterior), ampullofugal flow (i.e., flow away from the utricle) is **excitatory**. This is because the kinocilia of the hair cells in the vertical canal cristae are oriented on the canal side, so ampullofugal flow deflects the stereocilia toward the kinocilia, causing depolarization.\n\n4.  **Step (iv): Nystagmus Direction.** The excitatory signal from the R-PSCC is interpreted by the brain as a head rotation in the plane of that canal (a combination of pitching down and rolling with the right ear down). The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) generates a compensatory slow-phase eye movement to counteract this perceived motion. Excitation of the R-PSCC activates the ipsilateral superior oblique (R-SO) and contralateral inferior rectus (L-IR) muscles. The combined action of these muscles produces a slow-phase eye movement that is downward (depression) and torsional with the top poles of the eyes rotating to the patient's left (levo-torsion). The nystagmus is defined by its fast phase, which is a rapid saccadic reset in the opposite direction. Therefore, the fast phase is **up-beating** and **dextro-torsional** (top poles of the eyes beat toward the patient's right shoulder).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n-   **A.** This option correctly states: $m\\vec{g}\\cdot \\hat{t} > 0$, ampullofugal motion, ampullofugal flow, excitatory effect, and the resulting nystagmus is up-beating with torsion toward the right ear. This matches our derivation perfectly.\n-   **B.** This option incorrectly identifies the motion as ampullopetal and incorrectly states that vertical canal ampullopetal flow is excitatory.\n-   **C.** This option correctly identifies the motion but incorrectly states that ampullofugal flow is inhibitory. This contradicts known physiology.\n-   **D.** This option incorrectly identifies the motion as ampullopetal.\n\nThe only option that presents a correct and complete chain of reasoning is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5116439"}]}
