The ACL is modeled as a single linear elastic element, which is mathematically equivalent to an ideal spring. The governing equation for such an element is Hooke's Law.\n\nHooke's Law states that the force, $F$, required to stretch or compress a spring by some distance, $x$, from its equilibrium position is directly proportional to that distance. The constant of proportionality is the stiffness, $k$, of the spring. The relationship is expressed as:\n$$F = kx$$\n\nIn this problem:\n-   $F$ is the applied anterior drawer force, given as $F = 150 \\ \\mathrm{N}$.\n-   $k$ is the effective stiffness of the ACL, given as $k = 200 \\ \\mathrm{N/mm}$.\n-   $x$ is the deformation of the ligament. The problem states that for the small displacements considered, the ligament elongation is equal to the anterior tibial translation. Therefore, $x$ represents the anterior tibial translation we need to find.\n\nTo solve for the anterior tibial translation, $x$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$x = \\frac{F}{k}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into the equation:\n$$x = \\frac{150 \\ \\mathrm{N}}{200 \\ \\mathrm{N/mm}}$$\n\nPerforming the division:\n$$x = 0.75 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in millimeters and rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $0.75$ has two significant figures.
