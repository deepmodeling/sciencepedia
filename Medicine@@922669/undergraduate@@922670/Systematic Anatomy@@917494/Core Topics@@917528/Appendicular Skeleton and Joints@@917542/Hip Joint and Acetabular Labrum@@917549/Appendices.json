Treat all angles in radians.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is a well-defined application of solid mechanics and geometry to a simplified biomechanical model of the human hip joint.\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The model utilizes standard simplifications (spherical joint, spherical cap contact area, uniform stress assumption) and physiologically reasonable parameters for a biomechanics problem. It adheres to fundamental principles of mechanics and geometry.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary information to calculate the new contact area and the resulting stress. The relationship between the labral deepening and the change in contact angle is unambiguously defined by the geometry of the sphere. The question asks for a single numerical value.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and objective language.\n\nThe term \"peak contact stress\" could imply a non-uniform stress distribution. However, the problem's constraint to use only first principles of stress and geometry, without providing a stress distribution model (e.g., Hertzian), strongly implies that a uniform stress distribution should be assumed. In this standard simplification, the peak stress is equal to the average stress. With this clarification, the problem is entirely self-contained and consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the new contact stress on the femoral head after a surgical procedure increases the contact area.\n\n$1$. **Normal Stress Definition**: Mechanical stress, $\\sigma$, is defined as force per unit area. Since the force $F$ is stated to act normally to the contact patch of area $A$, the normal stress is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{F}{A}\n$$\nAs discussed in the validation, we assume the stress is uniformly distributed over the contact area. Therefore, the peak stress is equal to the average stress calculated by this formula.\n\n$2$. **Contact Area Geometry**: The contact patch is a spherical cap on a sphere of radius $R$. The area of a spherical cap is a standard result from differential geometry. For a cap defined by a half-angle $\\varphi$ (measured from the pole of the cap), its area $A$ is given by:\n$$\nA(\\varphi) = 2 \\pi R^{2} (1 - \\cos(\\varphi))\n$$\n\n$3$. **Determining the New Geometry**: The initial contact patch has a half-angle of $\\varphi_{0}$. The acetabular labrum is deepened by an amount $d = 2.0\\,\\text{mm}$, described as \"coverage measured along the spherical articular surface\". This description corresponds to an arc length on the surface of the sphere. This added arc length increases the half-angle of the spherical cap. Let the new half-angle be $\\varphi_{\\text{new}}$.\n\nThe relationship between an arc length $s$ on a great circle of a sphere of radius $R$ and the angle $\\theta$ it subtends at the center is $s = R\\theta$. The deepening $d$ represents the additional arc length by which the contact patch extends from its original rim. This corresponds to an angular increase $\\Delta\\varphi$ such that:\n$$\nd = R (\\Delta\\varphi)\n$$\nTherefore, the change in angle is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\varphi = \\frac{d}{R}\n$$\nThe new half-angle of the contact patch is the sum of the original half-angle and this increment:\n$$\n\\varphi_{\\text{new}} = \\varphi_{0} + \\Delta\\varphi = \\varphi_{0} + \\frac{d}{R}\n$$\n\n$4$. **Calculating the New Contact Stress**: We can now formulate an expression for the new stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{new}}$, by combining the equations above. The force $F$ is assumed to remain constant. The new area, $A_{\\text{new}}$, is calculated using the new angle, $\\varphi_{\\text{new}}$:\n$$\nA_{\\text{new}} = 2 \\pi R^{2} (1 - \\cos(\\varphi_{\\text{new}})) = 2 \\pi R^{2} \\left(1 - \\cos\\left(\\varphi_{0} + \\frac{d}{R}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThe new stress is then:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{F}{A_{\\text{new}}} = \\frac{F}{2 \\pi R^{2} \\left(1 - \\cos\\left(\\varphi_{0} + \\frac{d}{R}\\right)\\right)}\n$$\n\n$5$. **Numerical Calculation**: We now substitute the given values. The final answer is requested in megapascals (MPa). We recognize that $1\\,\\text{MPa} = 10^{6}\\,\\text{Pa} = 10^{6}\\,\\text{N/m}^{2} = 1\\,\\text{N/mm}^{2}$.

The description of the `acetabular labrum`, its blood supply, tear patterns (`radial tear`), and diagnostic methods (`MRI arthrography`) are all factually correct and represent a standard clinical scenario. The core concept that tissue healing is dependent on vascularization is a fundamental biological principle.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides sufficient, clear, and relevant information to arrive at a logical conclusion. It asks for a prediction based on a specific and well-defined set of anatomical principles, making it a solvable problem of deductive reasoning.\n3.  **Objective:** The language used is precise, clinical, and devoid of subjective or ambiguous terminology. Terms such as `anterosuperior`, `radial tear`, `avascular`, and `vascularity gradient` have specific, universally understood meanings in the medical sciences.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and free of any flaws that would preclude a rigorous analysis. A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe intrinsic healing potential of any tissue is fundamentally dependent on its blood supply, which delivers oxygen, nutrients, inflammatory mediators, and progenitor cells necessary for the complex cascade of repair. The `acetabular labrum`, being a fibrocartilaginous structure, has a unique and non-uniform vascular anatomy.\n\n1.  **Labral Vascularity:** The primary blood supply to the `acetabular labrum` arises from the surrounding hip joint capsule, which is fed by branches of the superior and inferior gluteal, obturator, and medial/lateral circumflex femoral arteries. These capsular vessels penetrate the labrum at its periphery, or base, where it attaches to the `acetabular rim`. Crucially, this vascular penetration is limited. The blood supply is most abundant in the outer one-third of the labrum (the capsular side) and diminishes progressively toward the inner, `articular free edge`. The inner two-thirds of the labrum are essentially `avascular`, receiving nutrition primarily through diffusion from the `synovial fluid`. This creates a distinct vascularity gradient from the well-perfused base to the `avascular` free edge.\n\n2.  **Regional Perfusion:** In addition to this base-to-edge gradient, vascularity also varies by quadrant. Histological and angiographic studies have demonstrated that the anterosuperior and superior regions of the labrum are comparatively less vascularized than the posterior and anteroinferior regions. The `anterosuperior` quadrant, a common location for tears related to femoroacetabular impingement, is thus a region with a relatively poor blood supply.\n\n3.  **Tear Morphology and Biomechanics:** The problem specifies a `radial tear`. The predominant `collagen fibers` in the labrum are oriented circumferentially, parallel to the `acetabular rim`, to resist hoop stresses. A `radial tear` propagates `perpendicularly` to these fibers, cleaving them. This is biomechanically unstable, as loading of the hip joint can cause the tear edges to gap, hindering any potential for approximation and healing.\n\n**Synthesis:** The specified `lesion` has three characteristics that jointly predict a very poor prognosis for intrinsic healing:\n- **Origin:** It originates at the `free inner edge`, the most `avascular` part of the labrum.\n- **Location:** It is in the `anterosuperior` quadrant, a region known for its relatively sparse perfusion.\n- **Type:** It is a `radial tear`, which disrupts the primary `collagen fibers` and is biomechanically unfavorable for healing.\n\nTherefore, the `intrinsic healing potential` is expected to be low due to an insufficient biological environment to support repair. The lack of blood flow prevents the formation of a fibrin clot and the subsequent migration of `inflammatory and reparative cells`.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. High intrinsic healing potential, because the anterosuperior labrum is richly vascularized by capsular vessels from the ascending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex artery and therefore supports robust repair even at the free inner edge.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The `anterosuperior labrum` is not richly vascularized; it is one of the less perfused quadrants. Furthermore, the claim of robust repair at the `free inner edge` directly contradicts the established principle of labral vascularity, as this edge is `avascular`.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. Low intrinsic healing potential, because a radial tear at the anterosuperior rim principally involves the inner articular zone that is relatively avascular, and this quadrant has comparatively sparse perfusion, limiting delivery of inflammatory and reparative cells.**\nThis statement accurately synthesizes the key anatomical facts. It correctly identifies that the tear involves the `avascular` `inner articular zone`. It correctly notes that the `anterosuperior` quadrant has `comparatively sparse perfusion`. Finally, it provides the correct physiological consequence: a limited delivery of the cells necessary for healing. This aligns perfectly with the derivation.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. Moderate intrinsic healing potential, because synovial fluid diffusion can provide nutrients comparable to vascular inflow, allowing fibrocartilaginous repair across the inner edge without reliance on capsular vessels.**\nThis statement makes an incorrect equivalence. While `synovial fluid diffusion` provides nutrition for the maintenance of chondrocytes in an `avascular` environment, it is wholly insufficient for the high metabolic demands and cellular processes of tissue repair (inflammation, proliferation, remodeling). Vascular inflow is indispensable for robust healing. The premise is false.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Uniform healing potential throughout the labrum regardless of location, because circumferential fiber tension approximates the tear edges and compensates for any vascular differences.**\nThis statement contains two major errors. First, healing potential is not uniform; it varies significantly based on the vascularity gradient from base-to-edge and by quadrant. Second, for a `radial tear`, the tension in the `circumferential fibers` would cause the tear to gape open, not approximate its edges.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. High intrinsic healing potential, because vessels traveling with the transverse acetabular ligament and ligament of the head of femur (ligamentum teres) enter the acetabular notch and directly perfuse the labral substance in the anterosuperior quadrant.**\nThis statement mischaracterizes the vascular anatomy. Blood supply from the vessels of the `ligamentum teres` is primarily for the femoral head. The vessels accompanying the `transverse acetabular ligament` supply structures in the inferior aspect of the joint, such as the acetabular fat pad and the inferior labrum, not the `anterosuperior` quadrant.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5114123"}, {"introduction": "This final practice is a capstone exercise that integrates anatomical structure, biomechanical forces, and clinical diagnostics. Clinicians rely on precise radiographic measurements to identify underlying hip morphologies that predispose patients to labral injury.

The acetabular center-edge angle (CEA) is defined as the angle between a vertical line through the femoral head center and a line connecting the femoral head center to the lateral edge of the acetabular sourcil; it quantifies superolateral acetabular coverage of the femoral head. The alpha angle is defined on the radial plane about the femoral neck axis as the angle between a line from the femoral head center to the point where the head-neck contour first departs from a best-fit circle and a reference line along the femoral neck axis; it quantifies femoral head-neck asphericity. Use the following well-accepted thresholds: developmental dysplasia of the hip is suggested when $\\text{CEA}  20^\\circ$, and a cam deformity is suggested when the alpha angle  55^\\circ$.\n\nAssume the following biomechanical principles and observations:\n- During single-leg stance in neutral hip position, the hip joint reaction force resultant passes through the femoral head center toward the superior load-bearing dome of the acetabulum, biasing contact toward the superolateral rim when osseous coverage is reduced. The acetabular labrum acts as a fibrocartilaginous ring that deepens the socket and resists rim-directed loads by hoop stress.\n- During deep hip flexion to approximately $90^\\circ$ with internal rotation of approximately $20^\\circ$, the anterosuperior femoral head-neck junction approaches the anterosuperior acetabular rim; in the presence of an increased alpha angle, the aspheric head-neck junction abuts the rim, imparting shear forces to the anterosuperior labrum.\n\nRadiographic measurements for two hips are:\n- Hip X: $\\text{CEA} = 18^\\circ$, alpha angle $= 48^\\circ$.\n- Hip Y: $\\text{CEA} = 30^\\circ$, alpha angle $= 62^\\circ$.\n\nWhich option best classifies each hip and predicts the predominant labral loading pattern in single-leg stance and in deep flexion with internal rotation?\n\nA. Hip X shows developmental dysplasia of the hip; in single-leg stance, the superolateral to anterosuperior labrum experiences increased compressive edge loading and hoop tension; Hip Y shows cam-type femoroacetabular impingement; in deep flexion with internal rotation, the anterosuperior labrum is subjected primarily to shear from femoral head-neck abutment, while quiet stance produces relatively lower labral load than the dysplastic hip.\n\nB.

All definitions, principles, and data are standard within the fields of orthopedic radiology and biomechanics. The problem is self-contained and allows for a unique solution based on the provided information.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by applying the given definitions, thresholds, and biomechanical principles to each hip individually.\n\nAnalysis of Hip X:\nGivens for Hip X are $\\text{CEA} = 18^\\circ$ and alpha angle $= 48^\\circ$.\n1.  **Classification:** The problem defines developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) as suggested when $\\text{CEA}  20^\\circ$. For Hip X, $\\text{CEA} = 18^\\circ$, which satisfies the condition $18^\\circ  20^\\circ$. Therefore, Hip X is classified as having developmental dysplasia of the hip. The problem defines a cam deformity as suggested when the alpha angle  55^\\circ$. For Hip X, the alpha angle is $48^\\circ$, which does not satisfy the condition $48^\\circ  55^\\circ$. Thus, Hip X does not have a cam deformity. The primary diagnosis is acetabular dysplasia.\n\n2.  **Loading Pattern:** The problem's first biomechanical principle states that in single-leg stance, reduced osseous coverage (as in DDH) biases contact forces toward the superolateral rim. The labrum resists these rim-directed loads. This increased loading on the labral rim results in both direct compressive stress (edge loading) and tensile stress along its circumference (hoop stress). This pathological loading predominantly affects the superolateral and anterosuperior aspects of the labrum, which are most under-covered in dysplastic hips.\n\nAnalysis of Hip Y:\nGivens for Hip Y are $\\text{CEA} = 30^\\circ$ and alpha angle $= 62^\\circ$.\n1.  **Classification:** For Hip Y, $\\text{CEA} = 30^\\circ$. This does not meet the criterion for DDH ($\\text{CEA}  20^\\circ$). A $\\text{CEA}$ of $30^\\circ$ is within the normal range (typically considered $25^\\circ$ to $39^\\circ$), indicating adequate acetabular coverage. For Hip Y, the alpha angle is $62^\\circ$. This satisfies the condition for a cam deformity, $62^\\circ  55^\\circ$. Therefore, Hip Y is classified as having a cam deformity, which is the characteristic feature of cam-type femoroacetabular impingement (FAI).\n\n2.  **Loading Pattern:** The problem's second biomechanical principle describes the loading pattern in the presence of an increased alpha angle. During deep hip flexion (approximately $90^\\circ$) with internal rotation (approximately $20^\\circ$), the aspheric femoral head-neck junction abuts the anterosuperior acetabular rim, imparting shear forces to the anterosuperior labrum. This is the classic mechanism of injury in cam-type FAI. In single-leg stance, because Hip Y has normal osseous coverage ($\\text{CEA} = 30^\\circ$), the joint reaction force is expected to be distributed more centrally over the superior acetabular cartilage dome, leading to relatively lower labral loading compared to the dysplastic Hip X, where forces are concentrated on the rim.\n\nEvaluation of Options:\n\nA. **Hip X shows developmental dysplasia of the hip; in single-leg stance, the superolateral to anterosuperior labrum experiences increased compressive edge loading and hoop tension; Hip Y shows cam-type femoroacetabular impingement; in deep flexion with internal rotation, the anterosuperior labrum is subjected primarily to shear from femoral head-neck abutment, while quiet stance produces relatively lower labral load than the dysplastic hip.**\nThis option correctly classifies Hip X as dysplastic ($\\text{CEA} = 18^\\circ  20^\\circ$) and accurately describes the resultant labral loading in stance (increased compressive and hoop stress on the superolateral rim). It correctly classifies Hip Y as having a cam deformity/impingement ($\\text{alpha angle} = 62^\\circ  55^\\circ$) and accurately describes the loading in flexion/internal rotation (anterosuperior shear). It also correctly infers that the labral load in stance for the normally-covered Hip Y is lower than for the dysplastic Hip X. All statements are consistent with our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nB. **Hip X has normal coverage; in single-leg stance, the labrum is unloaded relative to cartilage; Hip Y shows pincer-type impingement; the labrum is primarily compressed circumferentially both in stance and flexion.**\nThis option incorrectly classifies Hip X as having normal coverage; its $\\text{CEA}$ of $18^\\circ$ is dysplastic. The claim that the labrum is unloaded is contrary to the provided principles for dysplastic hips. It incorrectly classifies Hip Y as having pincer-type impingement, which is associated with acetabular overcoverage, not the femoral cam deformity present here.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nC. **Hip X demonstrates acetabular overcoverage; the posteroinferior labrum is preferentially loaded in single-leg stance; Hip Y shows cam deformity; in deep flexion with internal rotation, the posteroinferior labrum is primarily stressed.**\nThis option incorrectly classifies Hip X as having overcoverage; its $\\text{CEA}$ of $18^\\circ$ represents undercoverage. It incorrectly identifies the posteroinferior labrum as the loaded region in stance for a dysplastic hip; the load is superolateral.
