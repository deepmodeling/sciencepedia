The approximation for the obstetric conjugate is a standard clinical rule of thumb. The Caldwell-Moloy classification system based on the pelvic inlet shape is a classical method used in this field. The provided numerical values for the pelvic dimensions are within the normal physiological range for an adult human.

It is a straightforward computational problem grounded in established anatomical principles.\n\n### Step 3: Proceed to Solution\nThe task is to compute three pelvic ratios, classify the pelvis type based on the inlet ratio, and report the numerical value of the inlet ratio.\n\nFirst, we determine the anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic inlet, which is the obstetric conjugate, $C_{o}$. The problem provides an approximation based on the clinically measurable diagonal conjugate, $D_{c}$.\nThe given approximation is:\n$$C_{o} \\approx D_{c} - 1.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$$\nSubstituting the given value for $D_{c}$:\n$$C_{o} \\approx 12.9\\,\\mathrm{cm} - 1.5\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 11.4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$$\n\nNext, we compute the required pelvic indices.\n\n1.  **Inlet ratio ($r_{i}$)**: This is defined as the inlet anteroposterior diameter ($C_{o}$) divided by the inlet maximum transverse diameter ($T_{i}$).\n    $$r_{i} = \\frac{C_{o}}{T_{i}}$$\n    Using the calculated value of $C_{o}$ and the given value of $T_{i}$:\n    $$r_{i} = \\frac{11.4\\,\\mathrm{cm}}{13.2\\,\\mathrm{cm}} \\approx 0.863636...$$\n    The units of $\\mathrm{cm}$ cancel, yielding a dimensionless ratio as required.\n\n2.  **Midplane ratio ($r_{m}$)**: This is defined as the midplane anteroposterior diameter ($A_{m}$) divided by the interspinous diameter ($T_{m}$).\n    $$r_{m} = \\frac{A_{m}}{T_{m}}$$\n    Using the given values:\n    $$r_{m} = \\frac{11.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}}{10.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}} = 1.1$$\n\n3.  **Outlet ratio ($r_{o}$)**: This is defined as the outlet anteroposterior diameter ($A_{o}$) divided by the intertuberous diameter ($T_{o}$).\n    $$r_{o} = \\frac{A_{o}}{T_{o}}$$\n    Using the given values:\n    $$r_{o} = \\frac{11.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}}{10.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}} \\approx 1.095238...$$\n\nAfter calculating the indices, we classify the pelvis type based on the value of the inlet ratio, $r_{i} \\approx 0.8636$. The provided criteria are:\n- Anthropoid: $r_{i} \\geq 1.05$\n- Gynecoid: $0.95 \\leq r_{i} < 1.05$\n- Android: $0.85 \\leq r_{i} < 0.95$\n- Platypelloid: $r_{i} < 0.85$\n\nOur calculated value $r_{i} \\approx 0.8636$ satisfies the condition $0.85 \\leq 0.8636 < 0.95$.

The model, though simplified, is a common representation used in biomechanics for educational and first-order analysis purposes. All parameters (forces, dimensions, constraints) are explicitly defined. The problem is scientifically grounded in Newtonian mechanics, is well-posed with three linear equations for three unknowns, and is expressed in objective, formal language. A minor ambiguity exists in the statement \"$J_x = F_{abd}$\" when combined with \"$J_x$ (medially directed)\". Typically, $F_{\\mathrm{abd}}$ would be a magnitude (positive), while a medially-directed (leftward) component in the given coordinate system would be negative. The most logical interpretation is that the magnitude of the horizontal component is $|J_x| = F_{\\mathrm{abd}}$, and its direction is in the negative $x$-axis, thus the component value is $J_x = -F_{\\mathrm{abd}}$. This interpretation makes the problem physically and mathematically consistent. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will now be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution proceeds by applying the three conditions of static equilibrium to the pelvic ring, treated as a single rigid body.\n\n**1.

Its components are $\\vec{J} = (J_x, J_y)$.\n  - The vertical component is given: $J_y = 700\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n  - The horizontal component $J_x$ is related to the abductor force magnitude $F_{\\mathrm{abd}}$. We first calculate $F_{\\mathrm{abd}}$ from the moment balance equation:\n    $$F_{\\mathrm{abd}} d_{\\mathrm{abd}} = W d_{W}$$\n    $$F_{\\mathrm{abd}} = W \\frac{d_{W}}{d_{\\mathrm{abd}}} = (700\\,\\mathrm{N}) \\frac{0.10\\,\\mathrm{m}}{0.06\\,\\mathrm{m}} = 700 \\times \\frac{10}{6} = \\frac{7000}{6} = \\frac{3500}{3}\\,\\mathrm{N}$$\n  - The problem states $J_x$ is medially directed, which is the negative $x$-direction in the given coordinate system. Thus, the component $J_x$ is negative. Following the interpretation from the validation step, we take $J_x = -F_{\\mathrm{abd}}$.\n    $$J_x = -\\frac{3500}{3}\\,\\mathrm{N}$$\n  - The hip joint contact force vector is $\\vec{F}_J = (-\\frac{3500}{3}, 700)\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n- **Internal Reactions**:\n  - Left SI reaction: $\\vec{F}_{RL} = (0, R_L)$ at $\\vec{r}_L = (-0.08, 0)\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n  - Right SI reaction: $\\vec{F}_{RR} = (0, R_R)$ at $\\vec{r}_R = (0.08, 0)\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n  - Pubic symphysis reaction: $\\vec{F}_P = (P, 0)$ at $\\vec{r}_P = (0, -0.10)\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\n**2.

The Denis classification is a standard, widely accepted system for categorizing sacral fractures. The anatomical structures mentioned (sacral foramina, sacral canal, nerve roots) and the described injury pattern are factually correct and clinically realistic.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a specific and detailed set of radiological findings and asks for a classification and clinical correlation based on a defined system. The information is sufficient and internally consistent, allowing for a unique and logical deduction.\n- **Objectivity**: The description uses precise, objective clinical and radiological terminology (e.g., \"vertically oriented fracture line,\" \"preserved sacral canal outline\"). It is free from subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a rigorous analysis. I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\n**1. Fracture Classification using the Denis System:**\n\nThe Denis classification for sacral fractures is based on the location of the fracture line relative to the sacral foramina. It defines three zones:\n- **Zone I:** The fracture line is lateral to the sacral foramina, involving the sacral ala.\n- **Zone II:** The fracture line passes through one or more of the sacral foramina. These are typically vertical shear fractures.\n- **Zone III:** The fracture line involves the central sacral canal. This includes transverse fractures that cross the canal or longitudinal fractures of the central sacral body.\n\nThe problem states there is a \"vertically oriented fracture line passing through the right anterior sacral foramina at levels $S_1$ through $S_3$.\" This description precisely matches the definition of a **Denis Zone~$II$ fracture**. The findings that the \"midline sacral elements are intact\" and the \"sacral canal outline is preserved\" explicitly rule out a Zone~$III$ fracture. Because the fracture passes *through* the foramina, it cannot be a pure Zone~$I$ fracture.\n\n**2. Anticipated Neurological Deficit:**\n\nNeurological injury in sacral fractures is directly related to the anatomical structures compromised by the fracture.\n- The sacral foramina are the conduits for the sacral nerve roots. The anterior foramina transmit the ventral rami.\n- The fracture is on the right side and passes through the $S_1$, $S_2$, and $S_3$ foramina. Therefore, the structures at highest risk are the right $S_1$, $S_2$, and $S_3$ nerve roots. This would manifest as an ipsilateral (right-sided) radiculopathy.\n- An injury to the $S_1$ nerve root characteristically causes:\n    - **Motor deficit:** Weakness in ankle plantar flexion (innervation of gastrocnemius and soleus muscles).\n    - **Reflex deficit:** A diminished or absent Achilles tendon reflex.\n    - **Sensory deficit:** Numbness or paresthesia along the posterior calf and the lateral aspect of the foot.\n- Injury to the $S_2$ and $S_3$ roots would contribute to weakness in toe flexion and sensory changes in the posterior thigh and leg.\n- Critically, the central sacral canal, which contains the cauda equina fibers controlling bilateral perineal sensation and sphincter function (bowel, bladder), is explicitly noted as being \"preserved without visible encroachment.\" Therefore, central deficits like cauda equina syndrome (e.g., saddle anesthesia, urinary retention, loss of anal sphincter tone) are not the expected primary outcome for this unilateral Zone~$II$ injury.\n\nBased on this analysis, the patient is expected to have a Denis Zone~$II$ fracture with an ipsilateral radiculopathy affecting the $S_1-S_3$ nerve roots, with signs of $S_1$ injury being most prominent clinically. Bowel and bladder function should be preserved.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Denis Zone~$I$ fracture with the highest risk of bowel and bladder dysfunction due to central canal compromise; perianal anesthesia expected.**\n- **Classification:** Incorrect. The fracture passes through the foramina, defining it as Zone~$II$, not Zone~$I$.\n- **Neurology:** Incorrect. The highest risk for bowel/bladder dysfunction and perianal anesthesia is associated with Zone~$III$ fractures, which involve the central canal. The problem states the canal is preserved. This option is incorrect on both points.\n\n**B. Denis Zone~$II$ fracture with ipsilateral radiculopathy in $S_1$–$S_3$ distributions, such as weak ankle plantar flexion, reduced Achilles tendon reflex, and sensory loss over the lateral foot and posterior calf; anal sphincter tone and continence typically preserved.**\n- **Classification:** Correct. The fracture is a Denis Zone~$II$.\n- **Neurology:** Correct. The predicted deficit is an ipsilateral radiculopathy involving the nerve roots passing through the fractured foramina ($S_1-S_3$), with the signs described being classic for an $S_1$ root injury. The preservation of sphincter function is also the correct expectation for a unilateral Zone~$II$ fracture without canal compromise. This option aligns perfectly with the derivation.\n\n**C. Denis Zone~$III$ fracture causing isolated $L_5$ radiculopathy with foot dorsiflexion weakness and no distal sacral sensory or sphincter disturbance.**\n- **Classification:** Incorrect. The fracture is Zone~$II$, not Zone~$III$.\n- **Neurology:** Incorrect. First, a Zone~$III$ fracture would typically cause more extensive sacral plexus/cauda equina injury, not an isolated $L_5$ radiculopathy. Second, the anatomical location of the fracture (through $S_1-S_3$ foramina) points to an $S_1-S_3$ radiculopathy, not an $L_5$ radiculopathy (which affects foot dorsiflexion).\n\n**D. Denis Zone~$II$ fracture with predominant $L_5$ radiculopathy due to lumbosacral trunk injury across the sacral ala; Achilles reflex and plantar flexion remain normal.**\n- **Classification:** Correct. The fracture is a Denis Zone~$II$.\n- **Neurology:** Incorrect. While $L_5$ root injury can occur with high sacral fractures (typically Zone~$I$ involving the ala where the lumbosacral trunk passes), this option incorrectly predicts the sequelae. A fracture through the $S_1$ foramen would directly threaten the $S_1$ root, making it highly unlikely that the Achilles reflex and plantar flexion would \"remain normal.\" This neurological description contradicts the anatomical location of the injury.\n\n**E. Denis Zone~$III$ fracture with a high likelihood of bilateral saddle anesthesia and urinary retention, even when there is no sacral canal involvement on CT as described.**\n- **Classification:** Incorrect. The fracture is Zone~$II$, not Zone~$III$.\n- **Neurology:** Incorrect. This option presents a contradiction. A Zone~$III$ fracture is *defined* by central canal involvement. Claiming it is a Zone~$III$ fracture while accepting there is no canal involvement is logically inconsistent. Bilateral saddle anesthesia and urinary retention are hallmarks of central canal compromise, which is explicitly absent.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis confirms that the fracture is a Denis Zone~$II$ fracture and the most probable neurological finding is an ipsilateral $S_1-S_3$ radiculopathy, with preserved sphincter function. Option B is the only one that correctly identifies both the fracture classification and the corresponding neurological syndrome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5143183"}]}
