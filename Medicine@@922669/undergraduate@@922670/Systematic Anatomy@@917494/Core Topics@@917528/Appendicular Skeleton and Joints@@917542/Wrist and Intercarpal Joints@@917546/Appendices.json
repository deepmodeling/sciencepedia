The concept of ulnar variance and its effect on load distribution across the radiocarpal and ulnocarpal joints is a standard topic in orthopedics and bioengineering. The given load-sharing fractions ($82\\%$ on the radius and $18\\%$ on the ulna at neutral) are consistent with classic experimental findings (e.g., Palmer & Werner, 1984). The assumption of linearity for small deviations is a reasonable and common modeling approach.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides two distinct data points for the ulnar load fraction as a function of ulnar variance, which is sufficient to uniquely determine the parameters of the assumed linear model. The \"conservation of load\" provides a clear constraint to determine the load fraction on the radius from the ulna's fraction.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and objective language.\n4.  **Consistency:** The provided data points are consistent. For neutral variance, the sum of fractions is $0.82 + 0.18 = 1.00$, which agrees with the \"conservation of load\" principle. There are no internal contradictions.\n\nThe phrasing \"estimate... the fractions... in neutral posture\" might initially seem tautological, as these values are given. However, in the context of building and applying a model, this is a request to use the derived model to predict the values at one of the input data points, serving as a verification of the model's construction before applying it to a new, unknown point. This does not invalidate the problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nLet $x$ denote the ulnar variance in millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}$). Let $F_u(x)$ be the fraction of axial load transmitted through the ulna, and $F_r(x)$ be the fraction transmitted through the radius.\n\nThe problem states two primary conditions:\n1.  The total load is conserved between the radius and ulna:\n    $$F_r(x) + F_u(x) = 1$$\n2.  The fraction of load on the ulna, $F_u(x)$, is a linear function of the ulnar variance, $x$:\n    $$F_u(x) = mx + c$$\n    where $m$ is the slope and $c$ is the intercept.\n\nWe are given two data points to determine the parameters $m$ and $c$:\n-   Point 1: At neutral ulnar variance, $x_1 = 0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, the ulna transmits a fraction $F_u(0) = 0.18$. This gives the point $(0, 0.18)$.\n-   Point 2: At an ulnar variance of $x_2 = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, the ulna transmits a fraction $F_u(2.5) = 0.42$. This gives the point $(2.5, 0.42)$.\n\nWe can use these points to find the equation of the line. The intercept $c$ is the value of $F_u(x)$ at $x=0$. From Point 1, we have:\n$$c = F_u(0) = 0.18$$\n\nThe slope $m$ is calculated as the change in $F_u$ divided by the change in $x$:\n$$m = \\frac{F_u(x_2) - F_u(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{0.42 - 0.18}{2.5 - 0} = \\frac{0.24}{2.5}$$\n$$m = 0.096$$\n\nThus, the linear model for the fraction of load transmitted by the ulna is:\n$$F_u(x) = 0.096x + 0.18$$\n\nUsing the conservation of load, we can find the model for the radius:\n$$F_r(x) = 1 - F_u(x) = 1 - (0.096x + 0.18)$$\n$$F_r(x) = 0.82 - 0.096x$$\n\nNow we can calculate the required fractions.\n\n**1. Fractions at neutral ulnar variance ($x=0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$):**\nUsing our derived models at $x=0$:\n-   Radius fraction: $F_r(0) = 0.82 - 0.096(0) = 0.82$\n-   Ulna fraction: $F_u(0) = 0.096(0) + 0.18 = 0.18$\nThese results correctly match the input data provided in the problem statement.\n\n**2. Fractions at $+2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ ulnar variance ($x=2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$):**\nWe evaluate the models at $x=2$:\n-   Ulna fraction: $F_u(2) = 0.096(2) + 0.18 = 0.192 + 0.18 = 0.372$\n-   Radius fraction: $F_r(2) = 0.82 - 0.096(2) = 0.82 - 0.192 = 0.628$\nAs a check, the sum of fractions is $0.372 + 0.628 = 1.000$, which is consistent with the conservation of load.\n\nThe problem requires the answer as four decimal values, rounded to four significant figures.\n-   $F_r(0) = 0.82$. To four significant figures, this is $0.8200$.\n-   $F_u(0) = 0.18$. To four significant figures, this is $0.1800$.\n-   $F_r(2) = 0.628$. To four significant figures, this is $0.6280$.\n-   $F_u(2) = 0.372$. To four significant figures, this is $0.3720$.\n\nThe final results are presented in the specified order: radius at $0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, ulna at $0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, radius at $+2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, ulna at $+2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.8200 & 0.1800 & 0.6280 & 0.3720\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5167271"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple axial loads, we now examine the rotational stability of the carpus.

This corresponds to a normal range of approximately $0.51$ to $0.57$.\n- The accepted normal value for the revised carpal height ratio, $CHR_{Rev}$, is $1.57 \\pm 0.05$. This corresponds to a normal range of approximately $1.52$ to $1.62$.\n\nComparing our computed values to these standards:\n- The calculated $CHR_{Youm}$ of $0.4768$ is significantly below the lower limit of the normal range ($0.51$).\n- The calculated $CHR_{Rev}$ of $1.371$ is also significantly below the lower limit of the normal range ($1.52$).\n\nBoth indices consistently demonstrate a marked reduction in relative carpal height. This finding is the quantitative definition of **carpal collapse**.\n\nCarpal collapse refers to the loss of vertical height of the carpus, which is a key indicator of significant structural derangement and instability. This process is a common endpoint for several wrist pathologies, most notably scapholunate advanced collapse (SLAC) and scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse (SNAC). In these conditions, disruption of key ligamentous constraints (e.g., the scapholunate interosseous ligament in SLAC) or loss of scaphoid integrity (e.g., a scaphoid waist nonunion in SNAC) leads to a predictable pattern of carpal malalignment. The capitate, which is the keystone of the distal carpal row, migrates proximally into the space created by the flexion of the scaphoid and extension of the lunate (a deformity known as Dorsal Intercalated Segment Instability or DISI, characteristic of SLAC wrist). This proximal subsidence of the capitate directly reduces the carpal height, $H_c$, measured from the radius to the base of the third metacarpal.\n\nThe computed ratios, being significantly below normal, strongly indicate the presence of carpal collapse. The severity of the reduction suggests an advanced state of instability, although, as per the problem constraints, no specific stage of SLAC or SNAC can or should be inferred from these ratios alone. The measurement of carpal height loss is a fundamental tool for diagnosing, staging, and monitoring the progression of these debilitating wrist conditions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.4768 & 1.371 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "5167268"}]}
