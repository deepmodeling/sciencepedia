In the peripheral nervous system, large myelinated motor axons rapidly convey commands from the spinal cord to skeletal muscles, whereas small unmyelinated C fibers convey slow nociceptive signals from peripheral receptors back to the central nervous system. Two widely used empirical relationships (consistent with cable theory and saltatory conduction) approximate conduction velocity as proportional to axon diameter, with different proportionality constants for myelinated versus unmyelinated fibers. Using these relationships as well-tested formulas, compute the conduction velocities for:\n- a myelinated motor axon of diameter $d_{\\mathrm{m}}=12\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ using $v_{\\mathrm{m}}\\approx 6d_{\\mathrm{m}}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$,\n- an unmyelinated C fiber of diameter $d_{\\mathrm{u}}=1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ using $v_{\\mathrm{u}}\\approx 0.5d_{\\mathrm{u}}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\nThen, from the standpoint of the organization of sensorimotor and nociceptive pathways, interpret how these differences in conduction velocity influence the timing of motor outputs and pain perception between the spinal cord and distal limbs.

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of neurophysiology, specifically concerning the relationship between axonal properties and nerve conduction velocity. The provided data and empirical formulas are self-contained, consistent, and physiologically realistic for the specified neuron types. The problem is well-posed, leading to a unique quantitative solution and a reasoned qualitative interpretation.\n\nThe problem requires two parts: first, a quantitative calculation of conduction velocities for a myelinated motor axon and an unmyelinated C fiber; second, a qualitative interpretation of the physiological significance of these different velocities.\n\nFirst, we calculate the conduction velocity for the myelinated motor axon. The given relationship is $v_{\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 6d_{\\mathrm{m}}$, where the velocity $v_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is in units of $\\mathrm{m/s}$ when the axon diameter $d_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is in units of $\\mathrm{\\mu m}$. The constant of proportionality, $6$, therefore has the implicit units of $(\\mathrm{m/s}) / (\\mathrm{\\mu m})$.\nGiven the diameter $d_{\\mathrm{m}} = 12\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$, the conduction velocity is:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{m}} \\approx (6 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{m/s}}{\\mathrm{\\mu m}}) \\times (12\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}) = 72\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the conduction velocity for the unmyelinated nociceptive C fiber. The given relationship is $v_{\\mathrm{u}} \\approx 0.5d_{\\mathrm{u}}$, where the velocity $v_{\\mathrm{u}}$ is in $\\mathrm{m/s}$ and the diameter $d_{\\mathrm{u}}$ is in $\\mathrm{\\mu m}$. The constant $0.5$ has the same implicit units as before.\nGiven the diameter $d_{\\mathrm{u}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$, the conduction velocity is:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{u}} \\approx (0.5 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{m/s}}{\\mathrm{\\mu m}}) \\times (1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}) = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the final numerical answers to be rounded to three significant figures.\nFor the myelinated axon, $v_{\\mathrm{m}} = 72\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$ is written as $72.0\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\nFor the unmyelinated axon, $v_{\\mathrm{u}} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$ is written as $0.500\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\nThe interpretation of these results from the standpoint of the organization of the nervous system is as follows. The calculated velocities differ by a factor of $\\frac{72}{0.5} = 144$. This vast difference is a fundamental organizational principle that segregates neural information by urgency and function.\n\nMotor commands to skeletal muscles, particularly those in distal limbs, must be transmitted rapidly to allow for swift, coordinated, and precise movements. The high conduction velocity ($v_{\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 72.0\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$) of large myelinated motor axons ensures a minimal delay between a command issued from the central nervous system (spinal cord) and its execution by the muscle. For a limb approximately $1\\,\\mathrm{m}$ in length, the conduction delay is merely on the order of $\\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{m}}{72.0\\,\\mathrm{m/s}} \\approx 0.014\\,\\mathrm{s}$, or $14\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. This speed is critical for fast reflexes (e.g., the withdrawal reflex) and effective voluntary motor control.\n\nIn stark contrast, nociceptive signals, which convey information about potential or actual tissue damage (experienced as pain), are often carried by small, unmyelinated C fibers. The calculated low conduction velocity ($v_{\\mathrm{u}} \\approx 0.500\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$) means that these signals travel very slowly. For an injury in a distal limb $1\\,\\mathrm{m}$ from the spinal cord, the signal would take approximately $\\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{m}}{0.500\\,\\mathrm{m/s}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{s}$ to reach the central nervous system. This significant delay explains the phenomenon of \"second pain\"—the dull, burning, or aching sensation that develops well after an injury, following the initial sharp \"first pain\" sensation which is carried by faster, thinly myelinated A$\\delta$ fibers.\n\nThis functional segregation by conduction speed is a key aspect of nervous system organization. It allows the system to prioritize rapid protective motor reflexes and initial sensory awareness of a stimulus (via fast pathways) over the slower, more diffuse, and persistent signal of tissue damage (via slow pathways). This ensures immediate action for survival while still providing the central nervous system with the necessary information for longer-term responses like inflammation and guarding behaviors.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 72.0 & 0.500 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5138349"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of myelination, this practice explores a crucial organizational difference between the central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous systems.

In the central nervous system, a single oligodendrocyte can form multiple myelin internodes across different axons, whereas in the peripheral nervous system a single Schwann cell forms one myelin internode on a single axon. Assume the following idealized definitions:\n- An internode is the myelinated segment between two nodes of Ranvier, and a tract contains a total of $M$ internodes.\n- A glial cell’s myelination capacity is the average number of internodes it maintains, denoted $n$ for oligodendrocytes and $1$ for Schwann cells.\n- A demyelinating event is defined as the loss of a single glial cell, which immediately removes the myelin from all internodes that cell maintained.\nStarting only from these definitions and the principle of proportional reasoning, do the following:\n1) Derive a symbolic expression for the ratio of the expected proportion of internodes lost per demyelinating event in a tract populated by oligodendrocytes with average capacity $n$ versus a tract populated by Schwann cells.

Express the final answer as an integer (no rounding is needed).", "solution": "The problem asks for a derivation of the comparative vulnerability of myelinated tracts and for a specific numerical calculation regarding the cellular composition of a central nervous system (CNS) tract. The solution requires formalizing the provided definitions using proportional reasoning.\n\nFirst, we establish the mathematical relationships for a myelinated tract containing a total of $M$ internodes.\n\nFor a CNS tract myelinated by oligodendrocytes:\nLet $N_{oligo}$ be the number of oligodendrocytes. Each oligodendrocyte myelinates an average of $n$ internodes. The total number of internodes, $M$, can be expressed as the product of the number of cells and the average capacity per cell:\n$$M = N_{oligo} \\cdot n$$\nFrom this, the number of oligodendrocytes required to myelinate the tract is:\n$$N_{oligo} = \\frac{M}{n}$$\nA demyelinating event is defined as the loss of a single glial cell. In this case, the loss of one oligodendrocyte results in the demyelination of all $n$ internodes it maintains. The proportion of the tract's internodes lost, denoted $P_{oligo}$, is the number of internodes lost divided by the total number of internodes:\n$$P_{oligo} = \\frac{n}{M}$$\n\nFor a peripheral nervous system (PNS) tract myelinated by Schwann cells:\nLet $N_{Schwann}$ be the number of Schwann cells. Each Schwann cell myelinates a single internode, so its capacity is $1$. The total number of internodes is given by:\n$$M = N_{Schwann} \\cdot 1$$\nThis implies that the number of Schwann cells is equal to the number of internodes: $N_{Schwann} = M$.\nA demyelinating event in this system is the loss of one Schwann cell. This results in the loss of the single internode it maintains. The proportion of the tract's internodes lost, denoted $P_{Schwann}$, is:\n$$P_{Schwann} = \\frac{1}{M}$$\n\nPart 1: Derive the symbolic expression for the ratio of vulnerabilities.\nThe problem requires the ratio of the expected proportion of internodes lost per demyelinating event in the CNS tract versus the PNS tract. Let this ratio be $R$.\n$$R = \\frac{P_{oligo}}{P_{Schwann}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$R = \\frac{\\frac{n}{M}}{\\frac{1}{M}}$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$R = n$$\nThis result demonstrates that the vulnerability of the tract to a single-cell loss event is amplified by the factor $n$, the myelination capacity of the oligodendrocyte. The proportion of internodes lost from a single oligodendrocyte failure ($P_{oligo} = \\frac{n}{M}$) is directly proportional to $n$. A higher capacity $n$ means that the system is more efficient in terms of the number of cells required, but it is also more fragile, as the failure of a single cell has consequences that are $n$-times greater than the failure of a single Schwann cell in a comparably sized tract.\n\nPart 2: Estimate the number of oligodendrocytes for a given CNS tract.\nWe are given the following parameters for a specific CNS tract:\nThe total number of internodes is $M = 90,000$.\nThe average myelination capacity of an oligodendrocyte is $n = 30$.\nUsing the relationship $M = N_{oligo} \\cdot n$, we can calculate the number of oligodendrocytes, $N_{oligo}$, required to myelinate this tract.\n$$N_{oligo} = \\frac{M}{n}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values into the equation:\n$$N_{oligo} = \\frac{90,000}{30}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$N_{oligo} = 3,000$$\nThus, an estimated $3,000$ oligodendrocytes are required to myelinate a central nervous system tract that contains $90,000$ internodes, based on the given average capacity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3000}$$", "id": "5138472"}, {"introduction": "This final practice challenges you to apply your knowledge of large-scale anatomical organization to solve realistic clinical puzzles.

The anatomical pathways mentioned (corticospinal, DCML, anterolateral, spinal trigeminal) and their organization, including sites of decussation, are well-established facts in neuroscience and clinical neurology. The lesion scenarios are classic, clinically relevant examples (e.g., a variant of lateral medullary syndrome for Patient $1$, and focal spinal cord lesions for Patients $2$ and $3$).\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. For each patient, the lesion location and the affected tracts are specified. The task is to deduce a unique set of clinical deficits by applying the principle of decussation, which is explicitly defined.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and requires a rigorous, principle-based deduction.

Because these fibers have already crossed in the spinal cord, they are carrying sensory information from the **contralateral (right)** side of the body.\n    - **Conclusion**: The deficit is a contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation from the body.\n\n2.  **Spinal Trigeminal System (Pain/Temperature from the Face)**:\n    - First-order neurons, with cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion, enter the pons, and their central processes **descend ipsilaterally** as the spinal trigeminal tract.\n    - These descending fibers synapse on second-order neurons in the spinal trigeminal nucleus, which is located in the lateral pons, medulla, and upper cervical spinal cord.\n    - The axons of these second-order neurons then **decussate** and ascend to the thalamus.\n    - **Analysis**: The lesion in the left lateral medulla damages the left spinal trigeminal nucleus and its afferent tract. These structures process sensory information from the **ipsilateral (left)** side of the face *before* decussation.\n    - **Conclusion**: The deficit is an ipsilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation from the face.\n\n**Summary for Patient $1$**: Contralateral body pain/temperature loss and ipsilateral facial pain/temperature loss.\n\n**Patient $2$: Lesion in the Right Dorsal Columns at T$10$**\n\n1.  **Dorsal Column–Medial Lemniscus (DCML) System (Vibration/Proprioception/Fine Touch)**:\n    - First-order neurons, with cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia, send axons that enter the spinal cord and **ascend ipsilaterally** in the dorsal columns. Fibers from levels below T$6$ ascend in the fasciculus gracilis.\n    - These axons synapse on second-order neurons in the nucleus gracilis and nucleus cuneatus in the caudal medulla.\n    - The axons of these second-order neurons then **decussate** in the medulla (as internal arcuate fibers) to form the medial lemniscus.\n    - **Analysis**: A lesion of the right dorsal columns (fasciculus gracilis) at level T$10$ damages the axons of first-order neurons that are ascending on the same side they entered. These fibers are carrying information from the **ipsilateral (right)** side of the body and have not yet reached their decussation point in the medulla.\n    - **Conclusion**: The deficit is an ipsilateral loss of vibration and proprioception from the body at and below the level of the lesion (T$10$).\n\n**Summary for Patient $2$**: Ipsilateral vibration/proprioception loss below T$10$.\n\n**Patient $3$: Lesion in the Left Lateral Corticospinal Tract at C$6$**\n\n1.  **Corticospinal Tract (Voluntary Motor Control)**:\n    - The axons of upper motor neurons originate in the cerebral cortex and descend through the brainstem.\n    - Approximately $85-90\\%$ of these fibers **decussate** at the cervicomedullary junction (the pyramidal decussation) and descend in the contralateral spinal cord as the lateral corticospinal tract.\n    - These fibers then synapse on interneurons and lower motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord.\n    - **Analysis**: A lesion of the left lateral corticospinal tract at level C$6$ damages fibers that have *already crossed* in the pyramidal decussation. These fibers originated from the right motor cortex and are destined to control muscles on the **ipsilateral (left)** side of the body at and below level C$6$.\n    - **Conclusion**: The deficit is ipsilateral limb weakness (an upper motor neuron sign) at and below the level of the lesion (C$6$).\n\n**Summary for Patient $3$**: Ipsilateral limb weakness below C$6$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nBased on the derivations above:\n- **Patient $1$**: Contralateral body pain/temperature loss; Ipsilateral facial pain/temperature loss.\n- **Patient $2$**: Ipsilateral vibration/proprioception loss below T$10$.\n- **Patient $3$**: Ipsilateral limb weakness below C$6$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\n**A.
