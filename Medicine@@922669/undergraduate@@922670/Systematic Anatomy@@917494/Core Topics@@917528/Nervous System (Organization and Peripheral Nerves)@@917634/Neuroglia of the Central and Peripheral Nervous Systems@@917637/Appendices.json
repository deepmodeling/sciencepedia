Consider a cortical microdomain where neurons release glutamate into the extracellular space at a mean flux $F$ (in nmol/min).

It is scientifically sound, formalizable, self-contained, plausible, and well-structured.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the total steady-state ATP hydrolysis rate in astrocytes, which we will denote as $R_{ATP,a}$. This rate has two components based on the provided information:\n1. The ATP consumed by the $\\text{Na}^+/\\text{K}^+$ ATPase to restore the sodium gradient after glutamate uptake. Let this rate be $R_{ATP,pump}$.\n2. The ATP consumed by glutamine synthetase (GS) to convert glutamate to glutamine. Let this rate be $R_{ATP,GS}$.\n\nThe total astrocytic ATP hydrolysis rate is the sum of these two rates:\n$$R_{ATP,a} = R_{ATP,pump} + R_{ATP,GS}$$\n\nFirst, we determine the ATP cost per molecule of glutamate taken up by an astrocyte.\n- For each molecule of glutamate transported by an astrocytic EAAT, $3$ $\\text{Na}^{+}$ ions enter the cell.\n- The problem states that astrocytes restore this Na$^{+}$ balance using the $\\text{Na}^+/\\text{K}^+$ ATPase. One cycle of the $\\text{Na}^+/\\text{K}^+$ ATPase extrudes $3$ $\\text{Na}^{+}$ ions at the cost of hydrolyzing $1$ molecule of ATP.\n- Therefore, the energy cost for restoring the sodium gradient is $1$ ATP per glutamate molecule.\n- Additionally, glutamine synthetase consumes $1$ ATP to convert $1$ molecule of glutamate into glutamine.\n\nCombining these costs, the total ATP consumed by an astrocyte per molecule of glutamate it clears and converts is $1 + 1 = 2$ ATP.\n\nLet $J_a$ be the steady-state glutamate uptake flux into astrocytes, with units of nmol/min. The total astrocytic ATP hydrolysis rate is then twice the glutamate uptake flux:\n$$R_{ATP,a} = 2 J_a$$\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the steady-state astrocytic glutamate flux, $J_a$.\n\nLet $[Glu]$ be the steady-state extracellular glutamate concentration. The glutamate uptake fluxes into astrocytes ($J_a$) and neurons ($J_n$) are described by the Michaelis–Menten equation:\n$$J_a = V_a \\frac{[Glu]}{K_m + [Glu]}$$\n$$J_n = V_n \\frac{[Glu]}{K_m + [Glu]}$$\nThe total uptake flux, $J_{total}$, is the sum of the astrocytic and neuronal fluxes:\n$$J_{total} = J_a + J_n = V_a \\frac{[Glu]}{K_m + [Glu]} + V_n \\frac{[Glu]}{K_m + [Glu]} = (V_a + V_n) \\frac{[Glu]}{K_m + [Glu]}$$\n\nAt steady state, the total rate of glutamate release, $F$, must equal the total rate of glutamate uptake, $J_{total}$:\n$$F = J_{total}$$\n$$F = (V_a + V_n) \\frac{[Glu]}{K_m + [Glu]}$$\n\nThis equation defines the steady-state condition. We can solve for the fractional saturation term, $\\frac{[Glu]}{K_m + [Glu]}$:\n$$\\frac{[Glu]}{K_m + [Glu]} = \\frac{F}{V_a + V_n}$$\n\nNow we can express the astrocytic flux $J_a$ in terms of the given parameters by substituting this expression back into the Michaelis-Menten equation for $J_a$:\n$$J_a = V_a \\left( \\frac{[Glu]}{K_m + [Glu]} \\right) = V_a \\left( \\frac{F}{V_a + V_n} \\right)$$\nThis result shows that the total glutamate flux $F$ is partitioned between astrocytes and neurons according to the ratio of their maximal velocities, which is expected since they share the same $K_m$ and are exposed to the same $[Glu]$.\n\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $J_a$ into our equation for the ATP hydrolysis rate:\n$$R_{ATP,a} = 2 J_a = 2 V_a \\left( \\frac{F}{V_a + V_n} \\right) = \\frac{2 V_a F}{V_a + V_n}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the steady-state astrocytic ATP hydrolysis rate in terms of the given parameters. Notably, the value of $K_m$ is not required for this calculation.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values:\n$F = 2.4$ nmol/min\n$V_a = 3.0$ nmol/min\n$V_n = 1.2$ nmol/min\n\n$$R_{ATP,a} = \\frac{2 \\times (3.0) \\times (2.4)}{3.0 + 1.2} \\, \\text{nmol/min}$$\n$$R_{ATP,a} = \\frac{6.0 \\times 2.4}{4.2} \\, \\text{nmol/min}$$\n$$R_{ATP,a} = \\frac{14.4}{4.2} \\, \\text{nmol/min}$$\nTo simplify the fraction:\n$$R_{ATP,a} = \\frac{144}{42} = \\frac{72}{21} = \\frac{24}{7} \\, \\text{nmol/min}$$\nPerforming the division to obtain a decimal value:\n$$R_{ATP,a} = 3.4285714... \\, \\text{nmol/min}$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$R_{ATP,a} \\approx 3.429 \\, \\text{nmol/min}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.429}$$", "id": "5134944"}, {"introduction": "Myelination is a masterpiece of biological engineering, enabling the rapid transmission of neural signals, but this advantage comes at a metabolic price.
