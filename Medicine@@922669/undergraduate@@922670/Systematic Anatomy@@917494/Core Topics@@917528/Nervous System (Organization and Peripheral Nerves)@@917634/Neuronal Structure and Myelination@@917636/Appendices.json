The myelin sheath thickness is often summarized by the dimensionless g-ratio, defined anatomically as the ratio of the axon diameter to the total fiber diameter. Specifically, if the axon diameter is $d_{axon}$ and the total fiber diameter (axon plus myelin) is $d_{fiber}$, then by definition of the g-ratio, $g = \\frac{d_{axon}}{d_{fiber}}$. Empirically, for myelinated mammalian axons, conduction velocity (CV) is observed to scale approximately linearly with total fiber diameter, such that $v = k \\cdot d_{fiber}$, where $k$ is an empirical proportionality constant reflecting biophysical determinants of saltatory conduction.\n\nStarting from these anatomical and empirical bases (the definition of the g-ratio and the linear scaling of conduction velocity with fiber diameter), derive an expression for the conduction velocity as a function of the axon diameter and the g-ratio. Then, compute the conduction velocity and its sensitivity with respect to the g-ratio for the following anatomically realistic parameters:\n- Axon diameter $d_{axon} = 8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n- g-ratio $g = 0.60$.\n- Proportionality constant $k = 6.0\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$.\n\nDefine the sensitivity at a given g-ratio as the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial g}$ evaluated at the specified $d_{axon}$ and $g$.

Rearranging this definition to solve for $d_{fiber}$ in terms of $d_{axon}$ and $g$ gives\n$$\nd_{fiber} = \\frac{d_{axon}}{g}.\n$$\nThe empirical relation between conduction velocity and fiber diameter is $v = k \\cdot d_{fiber}$. Substituting the expression for $d_{fiber}$ into the conduction velocity relation yields\n$$\nv = k \\cdot \\frac{d_{axon}}{g}.\n$$\nThis expression shows that, for fixed $d_{axon}$ and $k$, the conduction velocity $v$ is inversely proportional to the g-ratio $g$. Anatomically, decreasing $g$ (thicker myelin relative to axon size) increases the total fiber diameter and thereby increases $v$; increasing $g$ (thinner myelin) decreases total fiber diameter and reduces $v$. This explains qualitatively why the sensitivity of $v$ to $g$ is negative.\n\nTo formalize the sensitivity, we compute the partial derivative of $v$ with respect to $g$ at fixed $d_{axon}$ and $k$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial g} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial g}\\left(k \\cdot \\frac{d_{axon}}{g}\\right) = -k \\cdot \\frac{d_{axon}}{g^{2}}.\n$$\nThis derivative is negative for positive $k$, $d_{axon}$, and $g$ (which hold anatomically), consistent with the inverse relationship.\n\nNow we evaluate the conduction velocity and its sensitivity numerically for the given parameters.

It presents a well-posed optimization problem grounded in established biophysical principles of neuroanatomy and physiology. All terms are clearly defined, the setup is internally consistent, and the assumptions, such as the linear scaling of conduction velocity with fiber diameter and costs scaling with cross-sectional areas, are standard and reasonable approximations in theoretical models of this nature. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of the g-ratio, $g$, that maximizes the dimensionless performance index $\\tilde{J}(g)$. The index is given as:\n$$\n\\tilde{J}(g) = a\\,\\tilde{d} - b\\,\\big(\\tilde{d}^{2} - 1\\big) - c\\,\\tilde{d}^{2}\n$$\nwhere $\\tilde{d} = \\frac{d_{\\text{fiber}}}{d_{\\text{axon}}} = \\frac{1}{g}$.

Since the parameters $b$ and $c$ are given as positive ($b > 0, c > 0$), the coefficient of the $\\tilde{d}^2$ term, $-(b+c)$, is strictly negative. This indicates that the function represents a parabola opening downwards, which possesses a single global maximum.\n\nTo find the value of $\\tilde{d}$ that maximizes $\\tilde{J}$, we take the first derivative of $\\tilde{J}(\\tilde{d})$ with respect to $\\tilde{d}$ and set it equal to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tilde{J}}{d\\tilde{d}} = \\frac{d}{d\\tilde{d}} \\left[ -(b+c)\\,\\tilde{d}^{2} + a\\,\\tilde{d} + b \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tilde{J}}{d\\tilde{d}} = -2(b+c)\\,\\tilde{d} + a\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find the critical point $\\tilde{d}^*$:\n$$\n-2(b+c)\\,\\tilde{d}^* + a = 0\n$$\n$$\n2(b+c)\\,\\tilde{d}^* = a\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{d}^* = \\frac{a}{2(b+c)}\n$$\nTo confirm this is a maximum, we can examine the second derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\tilde{J}}{d\\tilde{d}^2} = -2(b+c)\n$$\nSince $b>0$ and $c>0$, the second derivative is negative, which confirms that $\\tilde{d}^*$ corresponds to a maximum.\n\nThe optimal g-ratio, $g^*$, is the reciprocal of the optimal non-dimensionalized diameter, $\\tilde{d}^*$.\n$$\ng^* = \\frac{1}{\\tilde{d}^*} = \\frac{2(b+c)}{a}\n$$\nThis expression provides the general symbolic solution for the optimal g-ratio in terms of the weighting parameters $a$, $b$, and $c$.

The condition $g^* < 1$ requires $\\frac{2(b+c)}{a} < 1$, which is equivalent to $a > 2(b+c)$.\n\nNow, we substitute the specified numerical values for the parameters: $a = 10$, $b = 2$, and $c = 1$.\nFirst, we check the condition for the solution to be in the valid range: $10 > 2(2+1)$, which simplifies to $10 > 6$.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and its components are consistent. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is addressed in two parts as requested: a qualitative prediction followed by quantitative calculations.\n\n#### Qualitative Analysis\n\nSaltatory conduction relies on the efficient transmission of depolarizing current from one node of Ranvier to the next, across the intervening myelinated internode. The high resistance of the myelin sheath (represented by $R_{m}$) minimizes current loss, allowing the axial current to propagate with little attenuation.\n\n1.  **Effect on Current Spread and Attenuation**:\n    A selective increase in paranodal leak means the specific membrane resistance in the paranodal regions, $R_m$, is reduced. According to the formula for membrane resistance per unit length, $r_{m}(x) = \\frac{R_{m}(x)}{2 \\pi a}$, a decrease in $R_{m}$ leads to a proportional decrease in $r_{m}$ in the paranodal regions. This creates low-resistance \"shunt pathways\" for current to leak out of the axon before it reaches the next node. Consequently, a larger fraction of the total axial current is lost across the paranodal membrane. The voltage attenuation over the internode, described by $V(L)/V(0)$, will be more severe; that is, for a given voltage at the starting node $V(0)$, the voltage arriving at the next node, $V(L)$, will be smaller.\n\n2.  **Effect on Conduction Velocity ($v$)**:\n    Conduction velocity in saltatory conduction is determined by the time it takes for the depolarizing current to charge the membrane capacitance of the next node to its firing threshold. If the current arriving at the next node is weaker due to increased paranodal leak, this charging process will take longer. A longer internodal delay results in a slower overall conduction velocity. Therefore, the conduction velocity $v$ is predicted to **decrease**.\n\n3.  **Effect on Safety Factor**:\n    The safety factor of propagation is a measure of the robustness of the action potential transmission. It is defined as the ratio of the charge (or current) available to excite a node to the minimum charge (or current) required to bring it to threshold. Since the increased paranodal leak reduces the amount of current that successfully reaches the next node, the charge available for its excitation is diminished. This directly leads to a **reduction** in the safety factor. If the safety factor drops below $1$, conduction will fail entirely.\n\n#### Quantitative Analysis\n\nWe will now compute the change in internodal conductance and the ratio of conduction velocities. The axial resistance per unit length, $r_i$, is constant.\n$r_{i} = \\frac{\\rho_{i}}{\\pi a^{2}} = \\frac{0.70}{\\pi (4.0 \\times 10^{-6})^{2}} = \\frac{0.70}{1.6 \\pi \\times 10^{-11}}\\ \\Omega/\\mathrm{m}$.\n\n**1. Total Internodal Leak Conductance ($G$)**\nThe total internodal leak conductance $G$ is the integral of the membrane conductance per unit length, $g_m(x) = 1/r_m(x) = 2 \\pi a / R_m(x)$, over the length of the internode, $L$.\n$$ G = \\int_{0}^{L} g_{m}(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{2 \\pi a}{R_{m}(x)} dx $$\n\n-   **Before Disruption (old)**:\n    The specific membrane resistance is uniform: $R_m(x) = R_{m,0} = 5.0 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^2$.\n    The total conductance, $G_{\\mathrm{old}}$, is:\n    $$ G_{\\mathrm{old}} = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{2 \\pi a}{R_{m,0}} dx = \\frac{2 \\pi a L}{R_{m,0}} $$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$ G_{\\mathrm{old}} = \\frac{2 \\pi (4.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}) (1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m})}{5.0 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{2}} = \\frac{8.0 \\pi \\times 10^{-9}}{5.0 \\times 10^{7}}\\ \\mathrm{S} = 1.6 \\pi \\times 10^{-16}\\ \\mathrm{S} \\approx 5.027 \\times 10^{-16}\\ \\mathrm{S} $$\n\n-   **After Disruption (new)**:\n    The internode now has two regions. The paranodal regions have a total length of $fL$ and a specific resistance of $R_{m,1} = R_{m,0}/\\gamma$. The mid-internode region has a length of $(1-f)L$ and a resistance of $R_{m,0}$. The total conductance is the sum of the conductances of these parts:\n    $$ G_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\left(\\frac{2 \\pi a}{R_{m,1}}\\right)(fL) + \\left(\\frac{2 \\pi a}{R_{m,0}}\\right)((1-f)L) $$\n    Substituting $R_{m,1} = R_{m,0}/\\gamma$:\n    $$ G_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\left(\\frac{2 \\pi a \\gamma}{R_{m,0}}\\right)(fL) + \\left(\\frac{2 \\pi a}{R_{m,0}}\\right)((1-f)L) = \\frac{2 \\pi a L}{R_{m,0}} \\left( \\gamma f + (1-f) \\right) $$\n    $$ G_{\\mathrm{new}} = G_{\\mathrm{old}} \\left( 1 + f(\\gamma - 1) \\right) $$\n    Substituting the values $f=0.10$ and $\\gamma=5$:\n    $$ G_{\\mathrm{new}} = G_{\\mathrm{old}} \\left( 1 + 0.10(5 - 1) \\right) = G_{\\mathrm{old}} (1 + 0.40) = 1.4 \\times G_{\\mathrm{old}} $$\n    $$ G_{\\mathrm{new}} \\approx 1.4 \\times (5.027 \\times 10^{-16}\\ \\mathrm{S}) \\approx 7.038 \\times 10^{-16}\\ \\mathrm{S} $$\n    The disruption increases the total internodal leak conductance by a factor of $1.4$.\n\n**2. Ratio of Conduction Velocities ($v_{\\mathrm{new}}/v_{\\mathrm{old}}$)**\nThe problem states that conduction velocity $v$ is proportional to an effective length constant $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The ratio of velocities is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{new}}}{v_{\\mathrm{old}}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff, new}}}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff, old}}} $$\nThe effective length constant $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is defined such that the passive voltage attenuation over the internode is $\\exp(-L/\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}})$, which must equal the attenuation calculated from the local length constant $\\lambda(x)$, $\\exp\\left(-\\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{dx}{\\lambda(x)}\\right)$. Thus:\n$$ \\frac{L}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{dx}{\\lambda(x)} \\implies \\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{L}{\\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{dx}{\\lambda(x)}} $$\nThe local length constant is $\\lambda(x) = \\sqrt{r_m(x)/r_i} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m(x)}{2 \\pi a} \\frac{\\pi a^2}{\\rho_i}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m(x) a}{2 \\rho_i}}$.\n\n-   **Before Disruption (old)**:\n    $R_m(x) = R_{m,0}$ everywhere. The local length constant is uniform, $\\lambda(x) = \\lambda_{0} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m,0} a}{2 \\rho_i}}$.\n    The integral is simple: $\\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{dx}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{L}{\\lambda_0}$.\n    Therefore, the effective length constant is:\n    $$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff, old}} = \\frac{L}{L/\\lambda_0} = \\lambda_0 $$\n\n-   **After Disruption (new)**:\n    We have two regions for $\\lambda(x)$:\n    1.
