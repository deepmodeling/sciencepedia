This requires an understanding of the myotomes of the upper limb. A myotome is the group of muscles primarily innervated by the motor fibers of a single spinal nerve root. Since most muscles receive innervation from multiple spinal roots, weakness from a single radiculopathy (a lesion of a single root) is typically partial and proportional to that root's contribution to the muscle's overall innervation.\n\nWe must identify the key movements for which the $C7$ spinal nerve provides the primary or a very significant contribution.\n\n$1$. **Movements primarily controlled by $C7$**:\n    *   **Elbow Extension**: The triceps brachii muscle, the primary extensor of the elbow, is predominantly innervated by the $C7$ root (with contributions from $C6$ and $C8$). Therefore, weakness in elbow extension is a cardinal sign of $C7$ radiculopathy. The triceps reflex (a $C7$-mediated reflex) would also be expected to be diminished or absent.\n    *   **Wrist Flexion**: The wrist flexors, particularly the flexor carpi radialis, receive significant $C7$ innervation (along with $C6$). The flexor carpi ulnaris is more $C8$/$T1$. Thus, wrist flexion weakness is expected.\n    *   **Finger Extension**: The extensors of the fingers located in the posterior compartment of the forearm (e.g., extensor digitorum communis) are primarily innervated by $C7$ (and $C8$). Weakness in extending the fingers at the metacarpophalangeal joints is a key finding.\n\n$2$. **Movements with some $C7$ contribution but not primary**:\n    *   **Wrist Extension**: The wrist extensors (e.g., extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis) are often considered primarily $C6$ innervated, but $C7$ provides a major contribution. Some weakness may be present, but it's the hallmark of $C6$ radiculopathy when it is the predominant weakness.\n    *   **Forearm Pronation**: The pronator teres is innervated by $C6$ and $C7$. Some weakness may be observed.\n\n$3$. **Movements with minimal $C7$ contribution (relatively preserved)**:\n    *   **Shoulder Abduction**: This action is performed by the deltoid and supraspinatus muscles, which are primarily innervated by the $C5$ root (with some $C6$ contribution). Strength should be largely preserved.\n    *   **Elbow Flexion**: This action is carried out by the biceps brachii and brachialis muscles, which are primarily innervated by the $C5$ and $C6$ roots. Strength should be largely preserved.\n    *   **Intrinsic Hand Muscle Function**: The small muscles of the hand (interossei, lumbricals, thenar and hypothenar muscles) are primarily innervated by the $C8$ and $T1$ roots. Actions like finger abduction/adduction and fine motor control of the digits should be unaffected.\n\n**Summary of Expected Pattern for $C7$ Radiculopathy:**\n*   **Weakness**: Elbow extension, wrist flexion, finger extension.\n*   **Preserved Strength**: Shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, intrinsic hand movements.\n\nBased on the derived pattern, each option is evaluated.\n\n**A. Weak elbow extension, weak wrist flexion, and weak finger extension, with relative preservation of shoulder abduction and elbow flexion; no primary deficit of intrinsic hand abduction**\n*   **Weak elbow extension**: Consistent with $C7$ (triceps).\n*   **Weak wrist flexion**: Consistent with $C7$ (flexor carpi radialis).\n*   **Weak finger extension**: Consistent with $C7$ (finger extensors).\n*   **Relative preservation of shoulder abduction**: Consistent with sparing of $C5$/$C6$ (deltoid).\n*   **Relative preservation of elbow flexion**: Consistent with sparing of $C5$/$C6$ (biceps, brachialis).\n*   **No primary deficit of intrinsic hand abduction**: Consistent with sparing of $C8$/$T1$ (interossei).\nThis option perfectly matches the expected clinical presentation of an isolated $C7$ radiculopathy derived from first principles.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Weak shoulder abduction and elbow flexion, with preserved elbow extension and wrist flexion; marked weakness of deltoid and supraspinatus**\n*   **Weak shoulder abduction and elbow flexion**: This pattern points to $C5$ and $C6$ myotomes.\n*   **Preserved elbow extension and wrist flexion**: This is the opposite of a $C7$ lesion, where these movements would be weak.\n*   **Marked weakness of deltoid and supraspinatus**: These muscles are primarily $C5$ innervated.\nThis option describes a classic $C5$ or $C5$/$C6$ radiculopathy or an upper trunk brachial plexus injury, not a $C7$ radiculopathy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Weak wrist extension and thumb abduction with preserved elbow extension and wrist flexion; brachioradialis reflex diminished while triceps strength intact**\n*   **Weak wrist extension**: This is the cardinal sign of a $C6$ radiculopathy (extensor carpi radialis).\n*   **Preserved elbow extension**: This contradicts a $C7$ lesion, as the triceps ($C7$) would be weak.\n*   **Brachioradialis reflex diminished**: The brachioradialis reflex is primarily a $C6$-mediated reflex.\nThis option describes a classic $C6$ radiculopathy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Profound weakness of distal finger flexion and intrinsic hand abduction with intact elbow extension and wrist flexion; thenar and interosseous wasting predominates**\n*   **Profound weakness of ... intrinsic hand abduction**: This is a function of the interossei, innervated by $C8$ and $T1$.\n*   **Weakness of distal finger flexion**: Flexor digitorum profundus is $C8$/$T1$.\n*   **Intact elbow extension and wrist flexion**: This contradicts a $C7$ lesion.\n*   **Thenar and interosseous wasting**: This points to a chronic $C8$/$T1$ lesion (or peripheral nerve pathology like ulnar/median neuropathy).\nThis option describes a $C8$/$T1$ radiculopathy or a lower trunk brachial plexus injury (Klumpke's palsy).\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E.

This requires a systematic breakdown of the patient's signs and symptoms and mapping them to specific nerve roots and peripheral nerves.\n\n**Analyze the Patient's Deficits (using the givens):**\n\n*   **Motor Weakness:**\n    *   Ankle dorsiflexion ($3/5$): Primarily Tibialis Anterior. Innervation: Deep fibular nerve ($L4$, $L5$). This is weak.\n    *   Great toe extension ($3/5$): Primarily Extensor Hallucis Longus. Innervation: Deep fibular nerve ($L5$). This is weak.\n    *   Foot eversion ($2/5$): Primarily Fibularis (Peroneus) Longus and Brevis. Innervation: Superficial fibular nerve ($L5$, $S1$). This is weak.\n    *   Foot inversion ($4-/5$): Primarily Tibialis Posterior. Innervation: Tibial nerve ($L4$, $L5$). This is slightly weak. Tibialis Anterior (Deep fibular, L4, L5) also contributes to inversion. The mildness of this weakness is a key clue.\n    *   Plantarflexion ($5/5$): Primarily Gastrocnemius and Soleus. Innervation: Tibial nerve ($S1$, $S2$). This is normal.\n    *   Hip abduction ($4/5$): Primarily Gluteus Medius and Minimus. Innervation: Superior gluteal nerve ($L4$, $L5$, $S1$). This is weak. This is a CRITICAL finding.\n\n*   **Sensory Loss:**\n    *   Lateral aspect of the leg and the dorsum of the foot, including the first dorsal web space.\n    *   Lateral leg: Corresponds to the $L5$ dermatome and the territory of the superficial fibular nerve.\n    *   Dorsum of foot: Corresponds to the $L5$ dermatome and the territories of the superficial and deep fibular nerves.\n    *   First dorsal web space: Classic territory of the deep fibular nerve and the $L5$ dermatome.\n\n*   **Reflexes:**\n    *   Patellar tendon reflex ($L2$-$L4$, primarily $L4$): Normal. This argues *against* a significant $L4$ radiculopathy.\n    *   Achilles tendon reflex ($S1$): Normal. This argues *against* an $S1$ radiculopathy or significant tibial nerve/sciatic nerve lesion affecting the S1 fibers.\n    *   Medial hamstring reflex ($L5$, $S1$): Slightly diminished. The medial hamstrings (semitendinosus, semimembranosus) are innervated by the tibial division of the sciatic nerve ($L5$, $S1$, $S2$). This finding points to a lesion proximal to the knee affecting $L5$ or $S1$ fibers.\n\n**Synthesize the Findings:**\n\n*   The combination of weakness in ankle dorsiflexion, great toe extension, and foot eversion points strongly to the $L5$ myotome or the common fibular nerve.\n*   The sensory loss pattern (lateral leg, foot dorsum, first web space) is a classic fit for the $L5$ dermatome.\n*   **Crucial Differentiator 1: Hip Abduction Weakness.** Weakness of the gluteus medius/minimus (hip abduction) is a key sign. These muscles are innervated by the Superior Gluteal Nerve, which arises from the sacral plexus ($L4$, $L5$, $S1$) proximally in the pelvis. A lesion at the fibular neck or anywhere distal to the sciatic nerve's bifurcation would NOT affect the superior gluteal nerve. Therefore, the lesion must be more proximal: at the $L5$ nerve root or the sciatic nerve in the buttock/pelvis. This finding makes a peripheral fibular neuropathy (Option B, C) very unlikely.\n*   **Crucial Differentiator 2: Foot Inversion Weakness.** The Tibialis Posterior muscle (foot inversion) is innervated by the Tibial Nerve ($L4$, $L5$). The weakness here is mild ($4-/5$). In a pure common fibular nerve palsy, inversion should be strong. In an $L5$ radiculopathy, Tibialis Posterior weakness is expected, as $L5$ is a primary root for this muscle. So, mild inversion weakness supports an $L5$ radiculopathy over a common fibular lesion.\n*   **Crucial Differentiator 3: Reflexes.** The normal Achilles ($S1$) reflex makes a significant $S1$ radiculopathy or a severe tibial/sciatic neuropathy unlikely. The normal patellar ($L4$) reflex argues against a significant $L4$ radiculopathy. The diminished medial hamstring reflex ($L5$, $S1$) points to a proximal lesion involving $L5$ fibers, consistent with an $L5$ radiculopathy.\n*   **History and Provocative Signs:** The history of low back pain is suggestive of a radicular origin. The absence of Tinel's sign or tenderness at the fibular head argues against a compression at that site (common fibular neuropathy).\n\n**Evaluate Each Option:**\n\n*   **A. $L5$ radiculopathy due to $L4-L5$ disc herniation compressing the $L5$ root:**\n    *   **Motor:** An $L5$ radiculopathy classically causes weakness in $L5$-innervated muscles. This includes ankle dorsiflexion (Tibialis Anterior, root value $L4$, **$L5$**), great toe extension (Extensor Hallucis Longus, **$L5$**), foot eversion (Fibularis muscles, **$L5$**, $S1$), foot inversion (Tibialis Posterior, $L4$, **$L5$**), and hip abduction (Gluteus Medius and Minimus, $L4$, **$L5$**, $S1$). This pattern perfectly matches the patient's pattern of weakness: dorsiflexion ($3/5$), toe extension ($3/5$), eversion ($2/5$), mild inversion weakness ($4-/5$), and hip abduction weakness ($4/5$).\n    *   **Sensory:** The sensory loss described (lateral aspect of the leg, dorsum of the foot, first dorsal web space) corresponds precisely to the $L5$ dermatome.\n    *   **Reflexes:** The patellar tendon reflex ($L4$) and Achilles tendon reflex ($S1$) are expected to be normal in an isolated $L5$ radiculopathy, which they are. The medial hamstring reflex receives $L5$ innervation, so its diminution is also consistent.\n    *   **Localization:** A paracentral or foraminal disc herniation at the $L4-L5$ level is the most common cause of $L5$ radiculopathy. The history of low back pain is congruent with this etiology. This option provides a single, unified explanation for all the patient's signs and symptoms.\n    *   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. Common fibular (peroneal) nerve compression at the fibular neck:**\n    *   **Motor:** A lesion of the common fibular nerve would cause weakness in ankle dorsiflexion, toe extension, and foot eversion. However, it would **not** affect muscles innervated by the tibial nerve (like Tibialis Posterior, resulting in preserved or strong foot inversion) or the superior gluteal nerve (like Gluteus Medius, resulting in normal hip abduction). The patient has weakness in both foot inversion and hip abduction.\n    *   **Physical Exam:** The absence of tenderness or a positive Tinel's sign at the fibular head argues against this diagnosis.\n    *   Verdict: **Incorrect**. This diagnosis fails to account for the hip abduction weakness and the foot inversion weakness.\n\n*   **C. Deep fibular (peroneal) nerve entrapment at the ankle (anterior tarsal tunnel):**\n    *   **Motor:** A lesion of the deep fibular nerve at the ankle would cause weakness in the muscles it innervates distally, primarily the Extensor Digitorum Brevis and Extensor Hallucis Brevis. More proximal entrapment in the leg would affect the Tibialis Anterior and Extensor Hallucis Longus, causing foot drop. Crucially, it would spare the Fibularis muscles (foot eversion), which are innervated by the superficial fibular nerve. The patient has profound eversion weakness ($2/5$).\n    *   **Sensory:** Sensory loss would be confined to the first dorsal web space. The patient has much more extensive sensory loss.\n    *   Verdict: **Incorrect**. This diagnosis is inconsistent with the eversion weakness and the broad sensory deficit.\n\n*   **D. $L4$ radiculopathy due to $L3-L4$ disc herniation compressing the $L4$ root:**\n    *   **Motor:** An $L4$ radiculopathy typically affects knee extension (Quadriceps Femoris) and ankle dorsiflexion (Tibialis Anterior). Foot inversion may also be weak.\n    *   **Sensory:** The $L4$ dermatome involves the medial aspect of the leg and ankle, not the lateral leg and dorsum of the foot.\n    *   **Reflexes:** It would characteristically diminish or abolish the patellar tendon reflex. The patient's patellar reflex is normal, and the sensory loss is in the $L5$ distribution.\n    *   Verdict: **Incorrect**. The patient's presentation is a poor match for an $L4$ radiculopathy in terms of motor weakness, sensory distribution, and reflex findings.\n\n*   **E. Sciatic neuropathy predominantly affecting the fibular division:**\n    *   **Motor:** A lesion of the sciatic nerve could explain the weakness in muscles innervated by both its fibular and tibial divisions. A lesion predominantly affecting the fibular division would explain the foot drop (dorsiflexion and eversion weakness). It could also explain the mild foot inversion weakness (tibial division) and the diminished hamstring reflex (sciatic nerve proper). However, the sciatic nerve is formed distal to the takeoff of the superior gluteal nerve ($L4$, $L5$, $S1$), which innervates the hip abductors (Gluteus Medius and Minimus). The patient's hip abduction weakness ($4/5$) localizes the lesion more proximally to the nerve root or lumbosacral plexus itself, making a radiculopathy a better explanation than a sciatic neuropathy.\n    *   Verdict: **Incorrect**. The hip abduction weakness is the key finding that points to a lesion proximal to the sciatic nerve proper, favoring a radiculopathy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5151734"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice elevates the diagnostic challenge, asking you to distinguish a lesion in the peripheral nervous system (a dorsal root) from one within the central nervous system (the spinal cord itself).

You are asked to design a bedside sensory examination using pinprick, temperature, vibration, and two-point discrimination to distinguish a focal dorsal root lesion from a central cord lesion. The clinical decision must be based on mapping both segmental and longitudinal patterns of sensory loss across dermatomes.\n\nUse the following foundational base to guide your reasoning: dermatomes are cutaneous territories supplied by single spinal nerves; myotomes are muscle groups innervated by single spinal roots; the spinothalamic tract transmits pain and temperature sensations that enter the dorsal horn, synapse, cross the cord within approximately $1-2$ segments via the anterior white commissure, and then ascend contralaterally; the dorsal columns (gracile and cuneate fasciculi) transmit vibration and discriminative touch ipsilaterally to the medulla where they decussate; dorsal root lesions interrupt sensory input from a single root producing an ipsilateral, segmentally restricted loss across modalities in the corresponding dermatome; central cord lesions commonly interrupt the crossing spinothalamic fibers near the central canal producing a bilateral, “suspended” loss of pain and temperature at the affected segments with relative preservation of dorsal column modalities.\n\nWhich of the following proposed testing sequences and interpretations best distinguishes between a focal dorsal root lesion and a central cord lesion, by explicitly comparing segmental and longitudinal patterns?\n\nA.

First, it only tests dorsal column modalities, making it impossible to detect the dissociated sensory loss characteristic of a central cord lesion. Second, the pattern it describes—symmetrical distal sensory loss of vibration and proprioception—is the classic presentation of a length-dependent peripheral neuropathy, not a central cord lesion. Third, limiting the test to distal points prevents proper dermatomal mapping.

The examination is grossly incomplete, testing only one side and one set of modalities below the level of interest. The interpretation is incorrect. A contralateral loss of pain and temperature below a certain level is the hallmark of a Brown-Séquard syndrome (spinal cord hemisection), not a dorsal root lesion.
