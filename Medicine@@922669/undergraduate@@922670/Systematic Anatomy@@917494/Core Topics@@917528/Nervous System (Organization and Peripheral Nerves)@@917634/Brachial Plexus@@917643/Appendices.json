This first practice problem translates a specific nerve lesion—damage to the musculocutaneous nerve—into a tangible biomechanical quantity: the loss of elbow flexion torque. By calculating this deficit, you will apply the principle that net joint torque is the sum of contributions from individual muscles, directly linking anatomical structure to functional capacity.

At a standardized elbow angle and forearm position, the net elbow flexion torque in the intact limb is measured as $50\\,\\text{N·m}$. In this posture, the biceps brachii contributes a fraction $0.60$ of the net flexion torque and the brachialis contributes a fraction $0.30$ of the net flexion torque; remaining flexors (for example, brachioradialis innervated by the radial nerve and pronator teres innervated by the median nerve) supply the rest. Using the definition that net joint torque is the sum of individual muscle moments about the joint axis, and assuming the musculocutaneous lesion acutely eliminates active force generation from biceps brachii and brachialis while other muscles are unaffected and no compensatory changes occur, compute the reduction in net elbow flexion torque due to the lesion.

Provide an exact value; no rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific soundness, consistency, and completeness.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   The lesion affects the musculocutaneous nerve.\n-   The musculocutaneous nerve innervates the biceps brachii and brachialis muscles.\n-   The net elbow flexion torque in the intact limb is $\\tau_{\\text{net, intact}} = 50\\,\\text{N·m}$.\n-   The fractional contribution of the biceps brachii to the net flexion torque is $f_{\\text{biceps}} = 0.60$.\n-   The fractional contribution of the brachialis to the net flexion torque is $f_{\\text{brachialis}} = 0.30$.\n-   The remaining flexors contribute the rest of the torque.\n-   The net joint torque is the sum of individual muscle moments.\n-   The lesion is acute and eliminates active force generation from biceps brachii and brachialis.\n-   Other muscles are unaffected, and no compensatory changes occur.\n-   The objective is to compute the reduction in net elbow flexion torque.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The anatomical information regarding the musculocutaneous nerve, its innervation of the biceps brachii and brachialis, and their function as primary elbow flexors is correct. The biomechanical principle that net joint torque is the sum of individual muscle moments is a fundamental concept. The values provided for torque and fractional contributions are physiologically plausible.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data and a clear, unambiguous question. The simplifying assumption that \"other muscles are unaffected and no compensatory changes occur\" ensures that the problem is self-contained and has a unique solution.\n\nThe problem is objective. The language is precise and quantitative, free from subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\nThe problem setup does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, realistic, and well-structured.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nLet $\\tau_{\\text{net, intact}}$ denote the initial net elbow flexion torque in the intact limb. According to the problem statement, $\\tau_{\\text{net, intact}} = 50\\,\\text{N·m}$.\n\nThe net torque is the sum of the torques produced by the individual a muscles involved in elbow flexion. We can categorize these muscles into two groups: those innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve (biceps brachii and brachialis) and all other flexors.\nLet $\\tau_{\\text{biceps}}$ be the torque from the biceps brachii, $\\tau_{\\text{brachialis}}$ be the torque from the brachialis, and $\\tau_{\\text{other}}$ be the combined torque from all other elbow flexors.\n\nThe problem defines the net torque as the sum of individual contributions:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{net, intact}} = \\tau_{\\text{biceps}} + \\tau_{\\text{brachialis}} + \\tau_{\\text{other}} $$\n\nThe problem provides the fractional contributions of the biceps brachii and brachialis to the net torque:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{biceps}} = f_{\\text{biceps}} \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{net, intact}} = 0.60 \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{net, intact}} $$\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{brachialis}} = f_{\\text{brachialis}} \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{net, intact}} = 0.30 \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{net, intact}} $$\n\nThe lesion to the musculocutaneous nerve eliminates the function of the biceps brachii and brachialis. Under the assumption that other muscles are unaffected, their contributions to torque become zero. The new net torque after the lesion, $\\tau_{\\text{net, lesion}}$, is therefore solely due to the remaining flexors:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{net, lesion}} = \\tau_{\\text{other}} $$\n\nThe reduction in net elbow flexion torque, denoted as $\\Delta\\tau$, is the difference between the intact torque and the post-lesion torque:\n$$ \\Delta\\tau = \\tau_{\\text{net, intact}} - \\tau_{\\text{net, lesion}} $$\n\nSubstituting $\\tau_{\\text{net, lesion}} = \\tau_{\\text{other}}$:\n$$ \\Delta\\tau = \\tau_{\\text{net, intact}} - \\tau_{\\text{other}} $$\n\nFrom the initial torque summation, we can express $\\tau_{\\text{other}}$ as:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{other}} = \\tau_{\\text{net, intact}} - \\tau_{\\text{biceps}} - \\tau_{\\text{brachialis}} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\tau_{\\text{other}}$ into the equation for $\\Delta\\tau$:\n$$ \\Delta\\tau = \\tau_{\\text{net, intact}} - (\\tau_{\\text{net, intact}} - \\tau_{\\text{biceps}} - \\tau_{\\text{brachialis}}) $$\n$$ \\Delta\\tau = \\tau_{\\text{biceps}} + \\tau_{\\text{brachialis}} $$\n\nThis result is intuitive: the reduction in torque is precisely the sum of the torques that were being produced by the now-denervated muscles.\n\nWe can now substitute the fractional contributions:\n$$ \\Delta\\tau = (f_{\\text{biceps}} \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{net, intact}}) + (f_{\\text{brachialis}} \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{net, intact}}) $$\n$$ \\Delta\\tau = (f_{\\text{biceps}} + f_{\\text{brachialis}}) \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{net, intact}} $$\n\nUsing the given numerical values:\n$$ \\Delta\\tau = (0.60 + 0.30) \\cdot 50\\,\\text{N·m} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\tau = 0.90 \\cdot 50\\,\\text{N·m} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\tau = 45\\,\\text{N·m} $$\n\nThe reduction in net elbow flexion torque due to the lesion is $45\\,\\text{N·m}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{45}\n$$", "id": "5089877"}, {"introduction": "Neurological diagnosis is a process of systematic deduction, and the brachial plexus provides a perfect landscape for honing this skill. This exercise challenges you to design a clinical testing battery to distinguish between an injury to the $C5$ spinal root and a lesion of the terminal axillary nerve. Successfully solving this requires applying the fundamental principle that root lesions create broader deficits across a myotome, while peripheral nerve lesions are highly localized, a crucial distinction in clinical practice. [@problem_id:5089854]", "problem": "You are asked to design and select a focused clinical testing battery that distinguishes an isolated axillary nerve lesion from a $C5$ cervical root lesion in a patient with post-traumatic shoulder symptoms. Use only the following four domains: motor function of the deltoid, motor function of the teres minor, motor function of the biceps brachii, and cutaneous sensation over the “regimental badge” area. The battery must define both the maneuvers to test each domain and the diagnostic interpretation criteria.\n\nFundamental base for reasoning: the brachial plexus is formed by roots $C5$ through $T1$ that combine into trunks, divisions, cords, and terminal branches. The axillary nerve is a terminal branch of the posterior cord carrying predominantly $C5$–$C6$ fibers; it innervates the deltoid and teres minor and supplies cutaneous sensation via the superior lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm over the inferior aspect of the deltoid (“regimental badge”). The musculocutaneous nerve (from the lateral cord, predominantly $C5$–$C6$) innervates the biceps brachii. In root lesions, weakness and sensory loss follow a myotomal and dermatomal pattern (spanning multiple terminal nerves), whereas in terminal nerve lesions, deficits are confined to that nerve’s motor targets and cutaneous territory. The biceps deep tendon reflex (DTR) predominantly assesses $C5$–$C6$.\n\nWhich option below specifies a test battery and interpretation that most specifically identifies isolated axillary nerve palsy and, by contrast, a $C5$ root lesion?\n\nA. Maneuvers: isometric shoulder abduction strength test at $90^\\circ$ to assess the deltoid; isometric external rotation with arm adducted to assess the teres minor; elbow flexion strength in full forearm supination to assess the biceps brachii; pinprick/light touch over the inferior aspect of the deltoid (“regimental badge”) to assess axillary cutaneous sensation; plus biceps DTR. Interpretation: axillary nerve palsy is indicated by weak deltoid and teres minor with intact biceps strength, reduced sensation strictly over the regimental badge, and preserved biceps DTR. $C5$ root lesion is indicated by weakness in deltoid, teres minor, and biceps, broader lateral arm/forearm sensory change (dermatomal), and reduced biceps DTR.\n\nB. Maneuvers: shoulder abduction strength at $90^\\circ$, external rotation strength, elbow flexion strength, and pinprick over the regimental badge; plus biceps DTR. Interpretation: axillary nerve palsy is indicated when all three muscles (deltoid, teres minor, biceps) are weak, sensation is decreased along the entire lateral arm and forearm, and the biceps DTR is reduced; $C5$ root lesion is indicated when deltoid alone is weak with normal biceps and normal DTR.\n\nC. Maneuvers: shoulder abduction strength at $90^\\circ$ and external rotation with the arm adducted only; no biceps or sensory testing.

It innervates the deltoid and teres minor and provides sensation to the \"regimental badge\" area.\n    - The musculocutaneous nerve, from the lateral cord with predominant $C5$–$C6$ fibers, innervates the biceps brachii.\n    - Root lesions cause myotomal and dermatomal deficits (spanning multiple nerves).\n    - Terminal nerve lesions cause deficits confined to that nerve's distribution.\n    - The biceps deep tendon reflex (DTR) assesses the $C5$–$C6$ nerve roots.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The anatomical and physiological principles provided (brachial plexus structure, nerve innervations, myotomes, dermatomes) are fundamental and accurate facts in clinical neuroanatomy.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The task is to create a differential diagnosis based on a specified set of clinical tests. The existence of distinct anatomical pathways for the $C5$ root versus the terminal axillary nerve allows for a logical, unique solution.\n- **Objectivity:** The language is precise and uses standard, unambiguous medical terminology.\n\n**Flaw Checklist:**\n1.  **Scientific Unsoundness:** None.

Derivation of the Differentiating Clinical Profile**\n\nBased on the provided principles, we can deduce the expected clinical findings for each condition.\n\n**Profile 1: Isolated Axillary Nerve Lesion**\nAn isolated lesion of the axillary nerve will affect only the structures it innervates distal to the lesion.\n- **Motor Function:**\n    - Deltoid: Weakness, as it is innervated by the axillary nerve.\n    - Teres minor: Weakness, as it is also innervated by the axillary nerve.\n    - Biceps brachii: **Normal strength**. The biceps is innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve, which is a separate terminal branch from a different cord (lateral cord) and would be spared.\n- **Sensation:**\n    - Numbness or altered sensation will be confined to the cutaneous distribution of the axillary nerve, which is the \"regimental badge\" area (via the superior lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm).\n- **Reflexes:**\n    - Biceps DTR ($C5$, $C6$): **Normal**. The reflex arc (sensory afferent, spinal segment, and motor efferent via the musculocutaneous nerve) is intact. The lesion is peripheral to this arc.\n\n**Profile 2: $C5$ Cervical Root Lesion (Radiculopathy)**\nA lesion at the $C5$ root will affect all muscles (myotome) and sensory areas (dermatome) supplied by that root, regardless of the terminal nerve.\n- **Motor Function:**\n    - Deltoid: Weakness, as it is part of the $C5$ myotome.\n    - Teres minor: Weakness, as it is part of the $C5, C6$ myotome.\n    - Biceps brachii: **Weakness**. The biceps is a key muscle of the $C5$ myotome, innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve which carries $C5$ fibers.\n- **Sensation:**\n    - Numbness or altered sensation will follow the $C5$ dermatome pattern. This typically includes the lateral aspect of the shoulder and upper arm, a region that is *larger than and inclusive of* the \"regimental badge\" area.\n- **Reflexes:**\n    - Biceps DTR ($C5$, $C6$): **Diminished or absent**. A lesion at the $C5$ root directly disrupts the integrity of this reflex arc.\n\n**Summary of Key Differentiators:**\nThe critical distinction lies in the structures innervated by $C5$ fibers but via nerves other than the axillary nerve. Specifically, the status of the biceps brachii (motor function and reflex) is the most powerful differentiator.\n- **Axillary Nerve Lesion:** Deltoid/Teres minor weakness ONLY. Biceps strength and reflex are PRESERVED. Sensory loss is FOCAL.\n- **$C5$ Root Lesion:** Deltoid/Teres minor weakness PLUS Biceps weakness. Biceps reflex is DIMINISHED/ABSENT. Sensory loss is DERATOMAL (broad).\n\n**3. Evaluation of Options**\n\n**Option A:**\n- **Maneuvers:** Proposes testing of deltoid (isometric abduction at $90^\\circ$), teres minor (isometric external rotation with arm adducted), biceps brachii (elbow flexion in supination), sensation in the regimental badge area, and the biceps DTR. These are the correct, specific, and comprehensive maneuvers required to elicit the signs derived above.\n- **Interpretation:** States that axillary nerve palsy presents with weak deltoid/teres minor, intact biceps strength, sensory loss restricted to the regimental badge area, and a preserved biceps DTR. This is correct. It further states that a $C5$ root lesion presents with weakness in all three muscles (deltoid, teres minor, biceps), broader dermatomal sensory loss, and a reduced biceps DTR. This is also correct. The interpretation correctly uses the key differentiating findings.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option provides an accurate and complete testing battery and interpretation.\n\n**Option B:**\n- **Maneuvers:** The list of maneuvers is adequate.\n- **Interpretation:** This option incorrectly reverses the clinical findings. It describes the findings of a $C5$ root lesion (weakness in all three muscles, broad sensory loss, reduced DTR) and attributes them to an axillary nerve palsy. It then describes the findings of an isolated axillary nerve palsy (isolated deltoid weakness, normal biceps/DTR) and attributes them to a $C5$ root lesion. This is fundamentally flawed.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C:**\n- **Maneuvers:** Proposes testing only the deltoid and teres minor, explicitly excluding biceps and sensory testing. This is an incomplete test battery, as it omits the key differentiating tests. Both the deltoid and teres minor are weak in both conditions, so testing them alone cannot distinguish between the two pathologies.\n- **Interpretation:** The interpretation is non-specific. Diagnosing axillary palsy from deltoid weakness is insufficient. Diagnosing a $C5$ lesion from weak external rotation is also insufficient, as this is also a feature of axillary nerve palsy.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The proposed battery is inadequate for the stated diagnostic purpose.\n\n**Option D:**\n- **Maneuvers:** Omits deltoid testing. It suggests elbow flexion in pronation, which is a less specific test for the biceps brachii compared to flexion in supination.\n- **Interpretation:** The interpretation contains multiple errors. It suggests an axillary nerve palsy would have \"normal regimental badge sensation,\" which is a direct contradiction; the axillary nerve provides sensation to this area. It suggests a $C5$ root lesion would cause \"isolated biceps weakness\", which is also false; a root lesion would also affect other $C5$-innervated muscles like the deltoid.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.

The posterior cord supplies two of the three listed muscles (latissimus dorsi and triceps), making it an excellent target for initial screening.\n    *   **Step 1**: Test a muscle innervated by the posterior cord. Assessing elbow extension against resistance tests the triceps brachii (radial nerve).\n    *   **Step 2 (if Step 1 is positive)**: If triceps is weak, a posterior cord lesion is suspected. To confirm, test the other muscle supplied by the posterior cord, the latissimus dorsi. If latissimus dorsi is also weak, the diagnosis of a posterior cord lesion is strongly supported.\n    *   **Step 3 (if Step 1 is negative)**: If triceps is strong, a significant posterior cord lesion is unlikely. The investigation should then focus on finding evidence for a medial cord lesion. Test for the signature finding of a medial cord lesion: weakness of the sternocostal head of pectoralis major. This is tested via resisted horizontal adduction. To confirm the lesion is isolated to the medial cord, one must also confirm that the clavicular head (innervated by the lateral cord) is spared, which is done by testing resisted shoulder flexion. Isolated weakness of the sternocostal head localizes the lesion to the medial cord.\n\nThis derived algorithm is logical, efficient, and directly based on the provided anatomical principles.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Begin by assessing elbow extension against resistance to screen radial nerve function (posterior cord). If elbow extension is weak, next isolate latissimus dorsi... concurrent weakness of triceps and latissimus dorsi localizes to the posterior cord. If triceps and latissimus dorsi are normal, test pectoralis major by isolating the sternocostal fibers... Isolated sternocostal weakness with preserved clavicular head function indicates a medial cord lesion.**\nThis option perfectly matches the logically derived algorithm. It starts by screening for a posterior cord lesion by testing triceps, confirms with latissimus dorsi, and if negative, proceeds to test for the specific deficit of a medial cord lesion. The muscle testing descriptions are clinically accurate.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Begin by testing pectoralis major adduction; if weak, diagnose a posterior cord lesion. If strong, test elbow extension; if normal, diagnose a medial cord lesion.**\nThe first statement is anatomically incorrect. Weakness of pectoralis major adduction points to a medial and/or lateral cord lesion, not a posterior cord lesion. The second part of the algorithm is also flawed; normal elbow extension and \"strong\" pectoralis major adduction does not automatically confirm a medial cord lesion, as a subtle weakness of the sternocostal head could be missed or the patient could have no lesion at all.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Begin by assessing latissimus dorsi with resisted shoulder adduction; if weak while triceps is normal, diagnose a medial cord lesion. If both latissimus dorsi and triceps are weak, diagnose a lateral cord lesion.**\nThis option contains multiple errors. First, if latissimus dorsi (posterior cord) is weak, the diagnosis cannot be a medial cord lesion. Second, if both latissimus dorsi and triceps are weak, this indicates a **posterior** cord lesion, not a lateral cord lesion as the option claims.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Diagnose a medial cord lesion if the clavicular head of pectoralis major (tested by resisted shoulder flexion from neutral) is weak, regardless of triceps and latissimus dorsi findings; diagnose a posterior cord lesion if the sternocostal head is weak.**\nThis option incorrectly reverses the innervation of the pectoralis major heads. The problem states the lateral cord (via the lateral pectoral nerve) innervates the clavicular head, and the medial cord (via the medial pectoral nerve) innervates the sternocostal head. Therefore, weakness of the clavicular head would suggest a lateral cord lesion, and weakness of the sternocostal head would suggest a medial cord lesion. The option's diagnostic conclusions are the opposite of what the anatomical facts imply.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Begin by testing latissimus dorsi; if weak and pectoralis major (both heads) is weak, diagnose a posterior cord lesion because posterior cord supplies the pectoral nerves; if latissimus dorsi is normal and triceps is weak, diagnose a medial cord lesion.**\nThis option is factually incorrect on multiple counts. The posterior cord does NOT supply the pectoral nerves; the medial and lateral cords do. Therefore, the first diagnostic conclusion is based on a false premise. The second part is also incorrect; weakness of the triceps points to a posterior cord or radial nerve pathology, not a medial cord lesion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5089889"}]}
