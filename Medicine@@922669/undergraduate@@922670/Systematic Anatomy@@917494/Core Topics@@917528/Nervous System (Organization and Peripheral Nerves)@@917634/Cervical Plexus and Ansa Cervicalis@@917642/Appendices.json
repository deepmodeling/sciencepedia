This anatomical arrangement is crucial for the clinical reasoning required.\n\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear differential diagnosis between two specific neurological lesions and asks for the most distinguishing clinical sign. The provided information is sufficient to deduce a unique answer through logical application of anatomical principles.\n\n3.  **Objective**: The language is precise and unbiased. Terms like \"hypoglossal nerve\", \"ansa cervicalis\", \"superior root\", \"atrophy\", and \"fasciculations\" are standard, objective medical terms.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, realistic, and well-structured.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution will be derived by analyzing the distinct anatomical pathways and resulting clinical deficits.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe task is to identify a clinical sign that is present in a hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve $XII$) lesion but absent in an isolated lesion of the superior root of the ansa cervicalis (which is formed by fibers from cervical spinal nerve $\\mathrm{C1}$).\n\nLet's analyze the innervation patterns and the consequences of each lesion based on the provided facts:\n\n1.  **Hypoglossal Nerve ($CN~XII$) Injury**: The hypoglossal nerve's primary function is to provide motor innervation to the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue (except palatoglossus). Therefore, a lesion of $CN~XII$ will directly result in paralysis and subsequent denervation changes in the ipsilateral tongue muscles. As the problem states, this manifests as:\n    - Weakness of the genioglossus muscle, causing the tongue to deviate *toward* the side of the lesion upon protrusion.\n    - Long-term denervation leads to ipsilateral tongue muscle *atrophy* (loss of bulk) and *fasciculations* (spontaneous, fine muscle twitches).\n    These signs are specific to the loss of function of the hypoglossal nerve itself.\n\n2.  **Isolated Superior Root of the Ansa Cervicalis Injury**: The superior root is formed by fibers originating from the $\\mathrm{C1}$ spinal nerve that travel briefly with $CN~XII$ before branching off. This root, along with the inferior root (from $\\mathrm{C2}$-$\\mathrm{C3}$), innervates the infrahyoid muscles (sternohyoid, sternothyroid, omohyoid). An *isolated* lesion of the superior root, by definition, affects only these $\\mathrm{C1}$ fibers after they have separated from the main trunk of the hypoglossal nerve. Crucially, such a lesion would *not* affect the motor fibers of $CN~XII$ that continue on to supply the tongue muscles. Therefore, an isolated superior root lesion would result in weakness of the infrahyoid muscles but would spare all tongue muscles. The tongue would have normal strength, bulk, and no fasciculations or deviation.\n\n**Distinguishing Sign**: The key difference lies in the function of the tongue muscles. Signs of tongue muscle denervation are pathognomonic for a lesion affecting the motor fibers of the hypoglossal nerve proper. These signs would be completely absent in an isolated lesion of the ansa cervicalis' superior root. Therefore, the most specific sign favoring a $CN~XII$ injury is one that demonstrates tongue muscle dysfunction.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. On tongue protrusion, the tongue deviates toward the side of the lesion, with ipsilateral tongue atrophy and fasciculations.**\n- **Analysis**: This option describes the classic triad of signs resulting from a unilateral lesion of the hypoglossal nerve ($CN~XII$). As derived above, these signs are caused by the denervation of the tongue muscles. An isolated lesion of the superior root of the ansa cervicalis spares the tongue muscles, so these signs would be absent. The presence of these signs is therefore highly specific for a $CN~XII$ lesion in this differential diagnosis.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Delayed descent of the larynx after swallowing due to inability to depress the hyoid, with preserved tongue strength and bulk.**\n- **Analysis**: \"Delayed descent of the larynx\" points to weakness of the infrahyoid muscles, which are innervated by the ansa cervicalis. A lesion of the superior root ($\\mathrm{C1}$) would contribute to this weakness. However, a lesion of the hypoglossal nerve *proximal* to where the superior root branches off would also damage the traveling $\\mathrm{C1}$ fibers, causing the same infrahyoid weakness. Thus, the sign of infrahyoid weakness is not specific and can occur in both conditions. The phrase \"with preserved tongue strength and bulk\" describes the findings in an ansa cervicalis lesion, but the question asks for a sign that favors a *hypoglossal nerve injury*. This option describes a clinical picture that favors the ansa cervicalis lesion.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Shoulder droop with impaired resisted shoulder shrug on the side of the lesion.**\n- **Analysis**: These signs are characteristic of a lesion of the spinal accessory nerve (cranial nerve $XI$), which innervates the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles. This is unrelated to the hypoglossal nerve or the ansa cervicalis and is therefore irrelevant to the differential diagnosis presented.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Loss of taste from the anterior $\\tfrac{2}{3}$ of the tongue with an intact gag reflex.**\n- **Analysis**: Taste sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue is mediated by the chorda tympani, a branch of the facial nerve (cranial nerve $VII$). The gag reflex involves the glossopharyngeal nerve ($CN~IX$) and vagus nerve ($CN~X$). These functions are unrelated to the motor functions of the hypoglossal nerve or the ansa cervicalis.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5097070"}]}
