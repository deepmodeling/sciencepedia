Using idealized geometric shapes to model anatomical structures is a standard and valid method in biophysics, medical imaging, and quantitative anatomy. The mathematical principles cited (volume by integration, scaling of similar figures) are fundamental truths of calculus and geometry. The provided dimensions for a maxillary sinus are anatomically plausible.\n*   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information ($B$, $h$, and the first principles for the derivation) to arrive at a unique and meaningful solution. The instructions are clear and unambiguous.\n*   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in objective, formal language, free of subjective claims or bias.\n\n**Verdict:**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains a complete and consistent set of data and instructions for its resolution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the General Formula for Pyramidal Volume\n\nThe derivation will proceed as specified, starting from the principle of volume by integration.\n\nLet us set up a coordinate system. We place the apex of the pyramid at the origin $(0, 0, 0)$ and orient the pyramid such that its height lies along the $z$-axis. The base of the pyramid, with area $B$, is therefore located in the plane $z = h$.\n\nThe volume $V$ of any solid can be calculated by integrating the area of its cross-sections, $A(z)$, along an axis perpendicular to those cross-sections. In this case, we integrate along the $z$-axis from the apex ($z=0$) to the base ($z=h$):\n$$V = \\int_{0}^{h} A(z) \\, dz$$\n\nHere, $A(z)$ is the area of the cross-section of the pyramid at a given height $z$ from the apex. This cross-section is a planar figure (a triangle) that is geometrically similar to the base.\n\nThe problem states that the areas of similar planar figures scale as the square of the linear scale factor. Let $k$ be the linear scale factor between the cross-section at height $z$ and the base at height $h$. The relationship between the area of the cross-section, $A(z)$, and the area of the base, $B$, is:\n$$A(z) = k^2 B$$\n\nTo find the scale factor $k$, we can consider any linear dimension of the cross-section, say $L(z)$, and the corresponding linear dimension of the base, $L_B$. By constructing a right triangle with vertices at the origin (apex), a point on the perimeter of the base, and the center of the base, we see by similar triangles that the ratio of a linear dimension at height $z$ to the height $z$ itself is constant and equal to the ratio of the corresponding base dimension to the total height $h$.\n$$\\frac{L(z)}{z} = \\frac{L_B}{h}$$\nThe linear scale factor $k$ is the ratio of the linear dimensions of the cross-section to those of the base:\n$$k = \\frac{L(z)}{L_B} = \\frac{z}{h}$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $k$ into the area relationship gives the cross-sectional area as a function of $z$:\n$$A(z) = \\left(\\frac{z}{h}\\right)^2 B = \\frac{B}{h^2} z^2$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $A(z)$ back into the volume integral:\n$$V = \\int_{0}^{h} \\frac{B}{h^2} z^2 \\, dz$$\n\nSince $B$ and $h$ are constants for a given pyramid, we can move the term $\\frac{B}{h^2}$ outside the integral:\n$$V = \\frac{B}{h^2} \\int_{0}^{h} z^2 \\, dz$$\n\nThe integral of $z^2$ with respect to $z$ is $\\frac{z^3}{3}$. We evaluate this from $z=0$ to $z=h$:\n$$V = \\frac{B}{h^2} \\left[ \\frac{z^3}{3} \\right]_{0}^{h} = \\frac{B}{h^2} \\left( \\frac{h^3}{3} - \\frac{0^3}{3} \\right)$$\n$$V = \\frac{B}{h^2} \\left( \\frac{h^3}{3} \\right)$$\n\nSimplifying the expression yields the general formula for the volume of a pyramid:\n$$V = \\frac{1}{3} B h$$\nThis derivation successfully uses the two specified fundamental bases to arrive at the general expression for the volume of a pyramid, which is independent of the specific shape of its base.\n\n### Step 3: Numerical Evaluation\n\nThe problem requires the volume to be expressed in cubic centimeters ($\\text{cm}^3$). First, we must convert the given measurements from millimeters to centimeters.\n\nThe conversion factors are:\n$1\\,\\text{cm} = 10\\,\\text{mm}$\n$1\\,\\text{cm}^2 = (10\\,\\text{mm})^2 = 100\\,\\text{mm}^2$\n\nThe given values are:\n$B = 600\\,\\text{mm}^2$\n$h = 35\\,\\text{mm}$\n\nConverting to centimeters:\n$B = 600\\,\\text{mm}^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{1\\,\\text{cm}}{10\\,\\text{mm}}\\right)^2 = 600\\,\\text{mm}^2 \\times \\frac{1\\,\\text{cm}^2}{100\\,\\text{mm}^2} = 6.00\\,\\text{cm}^2$\n$h = 35\\,\\text{mm} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\text{cm}}{10\\,\\text{mm}} = 3.5\\,\\text{cm}$\n\nNow, we substitute these numerical values into the derived volume formula:\n$$V = \\frac{1}{3} B h = \\frac{1}{3} (6.00\\,\\text{cm}^2) (3.5\\,\\text{cm})$$\n$$V = (2.00\\,\\text{cm}^2) (3.5\\,\\text{cm})$$\n$$V = 7.0\\,\\text{cm}^3$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures. The calculated volume is $7.0\\,\\text{cm}^3$. To express this value with three significant figures, we write it as $7.00\\,\\text{cm}^3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.00}$$", "id": "5142066"}, {"introduction": "Beyond general size, specific anatomical dimensions can have profound clinical significance, particularly in surgical planning.

The new volumetric flow rate, $Q_{\\text{new}}$, is therefore given by:\n$$Q_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{\\pi (r_{\\text{new}})^{4}\\Delta P}{8\\eta L}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $r_{\\text{new}}$ into this equation yields:\n$$Q_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{\\pi (0.8r)^{4}\\Delta P}{8\\eta L}$$\n\nWe are tasked with finding the multiplicative factor by which the flow rate changes, which is the ratio $\\frac{Q_{\\text{new}}}{Q_{\\text{old}}}$. We construct this ratio using the expressions for $Q_{\\text{new}}$ and $Q_{\\text{old}}$:\n$$\\frac{Q_{\\text{new}}}{Q_{\\text{old}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi (0.8r)^{4}\\Delta P}{8\\eta L}}{\\frac{\\pi r^{4}\\Delta P}{8\\eta L}}$$\n\nThe term $\\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{8\\eta L}$ is common to both the numerator and the denominator and can be canceled, as it represents the collection of parameters that remain constant.
