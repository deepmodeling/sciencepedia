{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Before the vocal folds can vibrate to produce sound, they must first be brought together in a process called adduction. This action is not a simple closure but a precise three-dimensional movement of the arytenoid cartilages, controlled by several intrinsic laryngeal muscles. In this exercise [@problem_id:5120613], you will apply principles of biomechanics, specifically vector torque analysis, to understand how the coordinated action of the lateral cricoarytenoid (LCA) and interarytenoid (IA) muscles achieves complete closure of the glottis.", "problem": "An advanced-undergraduate anatomy student is asked to predict the kinematics at the cricoarytenoid joint during phonatory adduction by analyzing forces and torques on the arytenoid muscular process. Use the following baseline facts and definitions.\n\nThe lateral cricoarytenoid (LCA) muscle originates on the superior rim of the cricoid cartilage and inserts on the muscular process of the arytenoid cartilage; its contraction pulls the muscular process anteriorly and medially, producing adduction of the membranous glottis. The interarytenoid (IA) complex (transverse and oblique interarytenoid muscles) spans between the posterior surfaces of the two arytenoid cartilages and approximates their bodies, contributing to posterior glottic closure. The cricoarytenoid joint permits both rotation (rocking) and translation (gliding).\n\nLet the center of rotation and glide of each cricoarytenoid joint be the origin of a right-handed coordinate system with axes: lateral–medial along $x$ (with $+x$ lateral), anterior–posterior along $y$ (with $+y$ anterior), and inferior–superior along $z$ (with $+z$ superior). Approximate the position vector from the joint center to the muscular process as $\\mathbf{r} = (l, 0, 0)$ with $l > 0$. Model the LCA’s line of action at the muscular process as a net force $\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{LCA}} = (-f_m, +f_a, 0)$, where $f_m > 0$ is the medial component and $f_a > 0$ is the anterior component. The IA produces a net medial approximation force between the arytenoid bodies that, for each arytenoid, can be modeled as $\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{IA}} = (-g, 0, 0)$ acting approximately through the joint center, with $g > 0$.\n\nUsing the torque definition $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{F}$ and these anatomical constraints, which option best explains how simultaneous activation of LCA and IA achieves complete posterior glottic closure at the level of the posterior commissure?\n\nA. The LCA’s anterior component at the muscular process generates a torque about the vertical axis ($\\tau_z$) that internally rotates the arytenoid to adduct the vocal process, while the IA’s medial force acts with negligible moment (through the joint center) to translate and approximate the arytenoid bodies; together these effects close the posterior glottis.\n\nB. The LCA produces torque about the anteroposterior axis ($\\tau_y$) that tilts the arytenoid laterally and abducts the vocal folds, while the IA adds a downward ($-z$) force that depresses the arytenoids, thereby opening the posterior glottis.\n\nC. The LCA alone generates sufficient medial translation to close the posterior glottis, whereas the IA’s dominant effect is a lateralizing torque that counteracts closure by rotating the arytenoids away from midline.\n\nD. Simultaneous activation primarily elevates the arytenoids via torque about the vertical axis ($\\tau_z$), raising the glottis without changing mediolateral position; posterior closure is achieved by cricothyroid tension rather than by LCA–IA synergies.\n\nE. Posterior glottic closure depends mainly on oblique interarytenoid torque about the transverse axis ($\\tau_x$), producing posterior rotation of the arytenoids, with the LCA contributing minor lateral translation; rotational adduction of the vocal process is minimal in this mechanism.", "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **System**: Kinematics at the cricoarytenoid (CA) joint during phonatory adduction.\n- **Muscles and Anatomy**:\n    - Lateral cricoarytenoid (LCA) muscle: Originates on the superior rim of the cricoid cartilage and inserts on the muscular process of the arytenoid cartilage. Its contraction pulls the muscular process anteriorly and medially, producing adduction of the membranous glottis.\n    - Interarytenoid (IA) complex: Spans between the posterior surfaces of the two arytenoid cartilages and approximates their bodies, contributing to posterior glottic closure.\n- **Joint Kinematics**: The cricoarytenoid joint permits both rotation (rocking) and translation (gliding).\n- **Coordinate System**:\n    - Origin: Center of rotation and glide of each CA joint.\n    - Type: Right-handed.\n    - Axes: lateral–medial along $x$ (with $+x$ lateral), anterior–posterior along $y$ (with $+y$ anterior), and inferior–superior along $z$ (with $+z$ superior).\n- **Mathematical Model**:\n    - Position vector of the muscular process: $\\mathbf{r} = (l, 0, 0)$ with $l > 0$.\n    - Force vector of the LCA at the muscular process: $\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{LCA}} = (-f_m, f_a, 0)$, where $f_m > 0$ (medial component) and $f_a > 0$ (anterior component).\n    - Force vector of the IA: $\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{IA}} = (-g, 0, 0)$ with $g > 0$, acting approximately through the joint center.\n- **Governing Equation**: Torque $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{F}$.\n- **Question**: Which option best explains how simultaneous activation of LCA and IA achieves complete posterior glottic closure at the level of the posterior commissure?\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated for validity.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on established principles of human anatomy, physiology, and classical mechanics. The descriptions of the LCA and IA muscles, the CA joint, and the resulting adductory motion are consistent with standard anatomical literature. The use of vectors to represent forces and positions, and torque calculation via the cross product, is a standard biomechanical approach. The model is a simplification, but it is a physically and anatomically reasonable one for pedagogical purposes.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all the necessary information—a coordinate system, position vectors, force vectors, and the governing equation for torque—to derive the mechanical effects of the specified muscle activations. A unique and meaningful analysis is possible based on the givens.\n- **Objective**: The problem statement is written in precise, objective language. All quantities are defined mathematically, avoiding ambiguity and subjectivity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no contradictions, missing information, or other flaws.\n**Verdict: The problem is valid.**\nThe solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe task is to determine the kinematic effects (rotation and translation) produced by the LCA and IA muscles based on the provided force models and to explain how their combined action leads to posterior glottic closure.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Lateral Cricoarytenoid (LCA) Muscle**\nThe LCA force $\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{LCA}} = (-f_m, f_a, 0)$ is applied at the muscular process, located at position $\\mathbf{r} = (l, 0, 0)$ relative to the CA joint's center of rotation.\n\nThe torque produced by the LCA is calculated using the cross product:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{LCA}} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{LCA}} $$\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{LCA}} = (l, 0, 0) \\times (-f_m, f_a, 0) $$\nWe can compute the components of the torque vector using the determinant form:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{LCA}} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\ l & 0 & 0 \\\\ -f_m & f_a & 0 \\end{vmatrix} = \\mathbf{i}((0)(0) - (0)(f_a)) - \\mathbf{j}((l)(0) - (0)(-f_m)) + \\mathbf{k}((l)(f_a) - (0)(-f_m)) $$\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{LCA}} = (0)\\mathbf{i} - (0)\\mathbf{j} + (l f_a)\\mathbf{k} $$\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{LCA}} = (0, 0, l f_a) $$\nThe components of the torque are $\\tau_x = 0$, $\\tau_y = 0$, and $\\tau_z = l f_a$. Since it is given that $l > 0$ and $f_a > 0$, the torque component $\\tau_z$ is positive.\n\n- **Rotational Effect**: The LCA produces a pure torque about the vertical ($z$) axis. A positive $\\tau_z$ corresponds, by the right-hand rule, to a counter-clockwise rotation when viewed from above (from the $+z$ direction). The muscular process at $(l, 0, 0)$ is lateral to the joint center. The anterior component of the force, $f_a$, pulls this lateral process anteriorly. This rotation pivots the anteriorly-projecting vocal process toward the midline. This is known as internal rotation, which adducts the vocal fold.\n\n- **Translational Effect**: The force $\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{LCA}}$ also acts on the arytenoid cartilage as a whole, tending to cause translation. The components are a medial force $-f_m$ and an anterior force $f_a$. Thus, the LCA tends to slide the arytenoid medially and anteriorly across the cricoid facet.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Interarytenoid (IA) Muscle**\nThe IA muscle produces a force $\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{IA}} = (-g, 0, 0)$ which is stated to act \"approximately through the joint center\". This means the position vector for the application of this force is approximately zero, $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{IA}} \\approx (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n- **Rotational Effect**: The torque produced by the IA is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{IA}} = \\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{IA}} \\times \\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{IA}} \\approx \\mathbf{0} \\times \\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{IA}} = \\mathbf{0} $$\nThe IA muscle, as modeled, produces negligible torque (moment).\n\n- **Translational Effect**: The force $\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{IA}}$ is a pure medial force ($g > 0$, so the direction is $-x$). This force acts to translate the entire arytenoid cartilage medially, bringing it closer to the contralateral arytenoid. This action directly closes the posterior part of the glottis (the intercartilaginous part or posterior commissure).\n\n**3. Combined Effect for Posterior Glottic Closure**\n- The LCA's primary rotational effect is the adduction of the vocal processes, which closes the anterior (membranous) glottis.\n- The IA's primary translational effect is the approximation of the arytenoid bodies, which closes the posterior (cartilaginous) glottis.\n- The LCA also contributes a medial translational force which assists the IA.\nComplete glottic adduction for phonation requires this synergy: LCA-induced rotation closes the anterior glottis while IA-induced translation closes the posterior glottis.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The LCA’s anterior component at the muscular process generates a torque about the vertical axis ($\\tau_z$) that internally rotates the arytenoid to adduct the vocal process, while the IA’s medial force acts with negligible moment (through the joint center) to translate and approximate the arytenoid bodies; together these effects close the posterior glottis.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with the derivation. The LCA's anterior force component $f_a$ acting at a lateral distance $l$ creates the vertical torque $\\tau_z = l f_a$, causing adductory internal rotation. The IA acts through the joint center, producing negligible moment but a strong medial translational force that approximates the arytenoids. The combination of these actions closes the glottis.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The LCA produces torque about the anteroposterior axis ($\\tau_y$) that tilts the arytenoid laterally and abducts the vocal folds, while the IA adds a downward ($-z$) force that depresses the arytenoids, thereby opening the posterior glottis.**\nThe derivation shows $\\tau_y = 0$; the torque is about the $z$-axis. The resulting rotation is adduction, not abduction. The modeled IA force has no downward ($-z$) component. All claims in this option are contrary to the model and the derived results.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The LCA alone generates sufficient medial translation to close the posterior glottis, whereas the IA’s dominant effect is a lateralizing torque that counteracts closure by rotating the arytenoids away from midline.**\nThis is incorrect. The IA is explicitly described as contributing to posterior closure. The model shows the IA produces a medial force and negligible torque. The claim that IA produces a \"lateralizing torque\" is false. The LCA contributes to medial translation but is not solely responsible for posterior closure.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Simultaneous activation primarily elevates the arytenoids via torque about the vertical axis ($\\tau_z$), raising the glottis without changing mediolateral position; posterior closure is achieved by cricothyroid tension rather than by LCA–IA synergies.**\nThis is incorrect on multiple grounds. Torque about the vertical axis ($\\tau_z$) causes rotation, not elevation (translation along $z$). The modeled forces have no vertical components, so no elevation is predicted. Both LCA and IA have medial force components, so the mediolateral position changes significantly. Attributing closure to the cricothyroid muscle contradicts the premise of the question, which is about LCA-IA synergy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Posterior glottic closure depends mainly on oblique interarytenoid torque about the transverse axis ($\\tau_x$), producing posterior rotation of the arytenoids, with the LCA contributing minor lateral translation; rotational adduction of the vocal process is minimal in this mechanism.**\nThis is incorrect. The provided model for the IA states it acts through the joint center, producing negligible torque. Thus, it cannot have a dominant torque about the $\\tau_x$ axis. The LCA force produces a medial translation, not lateral. The rotational adduction from the LCA ($\\tau_z = l f_a$) is a key mechanism for membranous glottis closure and is not minimal.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5120613"}, {"introduction": "The acoustic pitch of the voice corresponds directly to the fundamental frequency ($f_0$) of vocal fold vibration. A fundamental question in voice science is how this acoustic output relates to the underlying physical state of the laryngeal tissues.

The final part of the question asks for an assessment of physiological plausibility, which is a standard scientific evaluation based on existing anatomical and physiological data, not subjective opinion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains no discernible flaws. It is therefore deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe physics of a uniform, tensioned string provides the basis for this analysis. The speed of a transverse wave, $v$, propagating along a string with tension $T$ and linear mass density $\\mu$ is given by the expression:\n$$v = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}$$\nFor a string of length $L$ fixed at both ends (at $x=0$ and $x=L$), the boundary conditions allow for the formation of standing waves. The wavelengths, $\\lambda_n$, of these standing waves are restricted to values that satisfy the condition $L = n \\frac{\\lambda_n}{2}$, where $n$ is a positive integer ($n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$) representing the harmonic number.\nThe frequency of each harmonic, $f_n$, is related to the wave speed $v$ and wavelength $\\lambda_n$ by $f_n = \\frac{v}{\\lambda_n}$. Substituting the expression for $\\lambda_n = \\frac{2L}{n}$, we get the formula for the allowed frequencies:\n$$f_n = \\frac{n v}{2L}$$\nThe fundamental frequency, $f_0$, corresponds to the first harmonic, where $n=1$. The problem statement designates the given frequency of $220$ hertz as the fundamental frequency. Therefore:\n$$f_0 = \\frac{v}{2L}$$\nNow, we derive the expression for the tension $T$. We begin by substituting the formula for the wave speed $v$ into the equation for the fundamental frequency:\n$$f_0 = \\frac{1}{2L} \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}$$\nTo solve for $T$, we rearrange the equation. First, we isolate the square root term:\n$$2 L f_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}}$$\nNext, we square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:\n$$(2 L f_0)^2 = \\frac{T}{\\mu}$$\n$$4 L^2 f_0^2 = \\frac{T}{\\mu}$$\nFinally, we multiply by $\\mu$ to solve for $T$:\n$$T = 4 \\mu L^2 f_0^2$$\nThis is the derived expression for the mean longitudinal tension $T$ in terms of the given parameters.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $T$ using the provided measurements: $L = 0.012$ m, $f_0 = 220$ Hz, and $\\mu = 0.015$ kg/m.\n$$T = 4 (0.015 \\, \\text{kg/m}) (0.012 \\, \\text{m})^2 (220 \\, \\text{Hz})^2$$\nLet's evaluate the terms:\n$$(0.012)^2 = 0.000144$$\n$$(220)^2 = 48400$$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $T$:\n$$T = 4 \\times 0.015 \\times 0.000144 \\times 48400$$\n$$T = 0.06 \\times 0.000144 \\times 48400$$\n$$T = 0.418176 \\, \\text{N}$$\nThe unit of the result is $\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-2}$, which is the definition of a Newton ($\\text{N}$). The problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$T \\approx 0.4182 \\, \\text{N}$$\n\nFinally, we assess the physiological plausibility of this result. The longitudinal tension of the vocal folds is actively controlled by the intrinsic laryngeal musculature. The primary muscles involved are the **cricothyroid (CT)** muscle, which stretches the vocal folds to increase tension and raise pitch, and the **thyroarytenoid (TA)** muscle (the body of the vocal fold), whose contraction increases the internal stiffness of the fold. The calculated tension of approximately $0.42$ N is for a fundamental frequency of $220$ Hz (the note A3), which is a typical mid-range pitch in the female speaking and singing voice (modal phonation). Published biomechanical studies and models of the human larynx report vocal fold tensions ranging from less than $1$ N for low to mid-range pitches up to several Newtons for high-pitched phonation (falsetto). The computed value of $T \\approx 0.4182$ N falls squarely within this physiologically expected range for modal phonation. Therefore, the result is considered physiologically plausible.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4182}$$", "id": "5120600"}, {"introduction": "Simple models are powerful, but the true elegance of the larynx lies in its complex, layered structure, which allows for subtle and varied vocal control.

This problem will deepen your understanding of how effective vibrating mass and tissue stiffness interact to control our voice.", "problem": "A subject phonates a sustained vowel while the cricothyroid (CT) muscle activation is kept approximately constant by biofeedback, and the subglottal pressure $P_s$ is held near $800\\ \\text{Pa}$ by monitoring and coaching. High-speed imaging and ultrasound show that, as the thyroarytenoid (TA) muscle activation is gradually increased, the medial vibratory thickness increases, the visible vibratory depth extends from the cover into the body, and vocal fold length decreases slightly by about $5\\%$. Concurrently, the measured fundamental frequency $f_0$ drops by about $20\\ \\text{Hz}$. \n\nUsing the body-cover model of the vocal folds, and reasoning from first principles about vibrating systems and tissue mechanics, select the option that best justifies how increased TA activation can lower $f_0$ at constant $P_s$ by altering the effective vibrating mass and the longitudinal mechanical state of the tissue. Your justification should be consistent with the layered anatomy (cover versus body), conservation of tissue volume on short time scales, and the distinction between aerodynamic drive and tissue resonance.\n\nA. Increased TA activation recruits the body into the vibrating structure, increasing effective vibratory thickness and therefore effective mass $m_{\\text{eff}}$, while active shortening reduces longitudinal strain and stress in the cover-ligament complex, lowering effective stiffness $k_{\\text{eff}}$; with $P_s$ unchanged, the decrease in $k_{\\text{eff}}$ and increase in $m_{\\text{eff}}$ together lower $f_0$.\n\nB. Increased TA activation primarily raises active stiffness of the body without changing the vibrating thickness, so effective stiffness $k_{\\text{eff}}$ increases at roughly constant effective mass $m_{\\text{eff}}$, and because $P_s$ is fixed, $f_0$ must increase.\n\nC. Increased TA activation raises $P_s$ via laryngeal constriction, and since $f_0$ is directly proportional to $P_s$, the observed reduction in $f_0$ follows from the reduced pressure after the constriction is overcome.\n\nD.

The body-cover model (Hirano, 1974) is a fundamental concept. The described roles of the CT and TA muscles are accurate: CT is the primary pitch-raising muscle via longitudinal tension, while TA forms the vocal fold body and can actively stiffen or shorten it. The observed phenomena (increased vibratory mass, decreased length, and decreased $f_0$ with increased TA activation at constant CT) are consistent with extensive experimental data and theoretical models in the field (e.g., those developed by Ingo Titze).

It is free of subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is a valid problem. The analysis will proceed.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\n\nThe fundamental frequency of vocal fold vibration, $f_0$, is primarily determined by the tissue's mechanical properties. As a first approximation, we can model the vocal fold as a simple mechanical oscillator, whose natural frequency, $f_n$, is given by:\n$$f_n = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\text{eff}}}{m_{\\text{eff}}}}$$\nHere, $k_{\\text{eff}}$ is the effective stiffness of the vibrating tissue, and $m_{\\text{eff}}$ is the effective mass participating in the oscillation. The phonation frequency $f_0$ is closely coupled to this natural frequency. We must analyze how increasing TA activation affects $k_{\\text{eff}}$ and $m_{\\text{eff}}$ under the given conditions.\n\n1.  **Effect on Effective Mass ($m_{\\text{eff}}$):**\n    The problem states that as TA activation increases, \"the medial vibratory thickness increases\" and \"the visible vibratory depth extends from the cover into the body.\" The body-cover model distinguishes the superficial, pliable 'cover' from the deeper, muscular 'body' (the TA muscle itself). These observations mean that a greater volume of tissue, including the deeper and denser muscle layer, is being set into motion. Therefore, the effective mass participating in the vibration, $m_{\\text{eff}}$, increases.\n\n2.  **Effect on Effective Stiffness ($k_{\\text{eff}}$):**\n    This effect is more complex and involves the interplay between active muscle contraction and passive tissue tension.\n    - The TA muscle is an agonist to the CT muscle. The CT muscle elongates the vocal folds, increasing longitudinal tension and thus stiffness (raising $f_0$). The TA muscle, when it contracts, tends to shorten the vocal folds.\n    - In this scenario, CT activation is held constant, while TA activation increases. The problem states this results in a net \"vocal fold length decrease[] slightly by about $5\\%$\".\n    - This shortening has a critical consequence for the 'cover' of the vocal fold (the epithelium, lamina propria, and vocal ligament). As the overall length decreases, these passive, elastic layers become less stretched; they become slack. The longitudinal tensile stress ($\\sigma$) within the cover decreases. Stiffness is proportional to tension, so the stiffness contribution from the cover, $k_{\\text{cover}}$, decreases significantly.\n    - Concurrently, the TA muscle itself becomes stiffer due to active contraction. This increases the stiffness of the 'body', $k_{\\text{body}}$.\n    - The *effective* stiffness, $k_{\\text{eff}}$, is a combination of these factors. However, for pitch control in this \"chest voice\" or \"modal register\" mechanism, the longitudinal tension of the cover is a dominant factor. The slackening of the cover due to TA-induced shortening leads to a net *decrease* in the overall effective stiffness $k_{\\text{eff}}$.\n\n3.  **Synthesis and Effect on $f_0$:**\n    We have established that with increased TA activation:\n    - $m_{\\text{eff}}$ increases ($\\uparrow$).\n    - $k_{\\text{eff}}$ decreases ($\\downarrow$).\n\n    Substituting these changes into the frequency equation:\n    $$f_0 \\propto \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\text{eff}} \\downarrow}{m_{\\text{eff}} \\uparrow}}$$\n    Both the decrease in the numerator ($k_{\\text{eff}}$) and the increase in the denominator ($m_{\\text{eff}}$) act to lower the frequency $f_0$. This physical reasoning is fully consistent with the observed drop in $f_0$ by approximately $20\\ \\text{Hz}$. The principle of volume conservation is also consistent: the observed decrease in length ($L$) of $5\\%$ must be accompanied by an increase in cross-sectional area ($A$) to keep volume ($V = L \\times A$) constant, which aligns with the observation of increased vibratory thickness.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Increased TA activation recruits the body into the vibrating structure, increasing effective vibratory thickness and therefore effective mass $m_{\\text{eff}}$, while active shortening reduces longitudinal strain and stress in the cover-ligament complex, lowering effective stiffness $k_{\\text{eff}}$; with $P_s$ unchanged, the decrease in $k_{\\text{eff}}$ and increase in $m_{\\text{eff}}$ together lower $f_0$.**\nThis option correctly identifies all key mechanisms derived from first principles. It correctly states that $m_{\\text{eff}}$ increases due to body recruitment. It correctly identifies that active shortening reduces longitudinal stress in the cover, thus lowering $k_{\\text{eff}}$. It correctly concludes that the combination of increased $m_{\\text{eff}}$ and decreased $k_{\\text{eff}}$ causes $f_0$ to decrease, matching the experimental data.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Increased TA activation primarily raises active stiffness of the body without changing the vibrating thickness, so effective stiffness $k_{\\text{eff}}$ increases at roughly constant effective mass $m_{\\text{eff}}$, and because $P_s$ is fixed, $f_0$ must increase.**\nThis option contains several errors. It claims vibrating thickness does not change, which directly contradicts the problem statement (\"medial vibratory thickness increases\"). It claims $m_{\\text{eff}}$ is roughly constant, which is inconsistent with the vibration extending into the body. It incorrectly assumes the net effect is an increase in $k_{\\text{eff}}$ by ignoring the slackening of the cover. Finally, it predicts an increase in $f_0$, which is the opposite of the observed outcome.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Increased TA activation raises $P_s$ via laryngeal constriction, and since $f_0$ is directly proportional to $P_s$, the observed reduction in $f_0$ follows from the reduced pressure after the constriction is overcome.**\nThis option violates a primary condition of the problem, which explicitly states that subglottal pressure $P_s$ is \"held near $800\\ \\text{Pa}$\" (i.e., is constant). Furthermore, the relationship between $f_0$ and $P_s$ is not one of direct proportionality, and the logic presented is internally inconsistent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Increased TA activation lengthens the vocal folds, increasing longitudinal strain and stress in the cover-ligament complex and decreasing the effective mass $m_{\\text{eff}}$, thereby raising $f_0$ despite constant $P_s$.**\nThis option misidentifies the action of the TA muscle. Increased TA activation shortens the vocal folds, it does not lengthen them. The problem explicitly states that \"vocal fold length decreases slightly\". Consequently, all subsequent deductions in this option (increased strain, decreased mass, raised frequency) are based on a false premise and contradict the provided data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Increased TA activation affects only adduction and collision (damping), not the tissue’s effective mass or stiffness; increased damping alone lowers $f_0$ appreciably at constant $P_s$ even if the mechanical resonance remains unchanged.**\nThis option's central premise, that TA activation affects *only* damping, is fundamentally wrong. The TA muscle *is* the body of the vocal fold, and its activation is a primary control over the tissue's mass and stiffness properties, as explicitly stated in the problem's observations. While damping does increase, its effect on frequency is generally small compared to the effects of mass and stiffness changes. Attributing a $20\\ \\text{Hz}$ drop entirely to damping is not a plausible explanation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5120653"}]}
