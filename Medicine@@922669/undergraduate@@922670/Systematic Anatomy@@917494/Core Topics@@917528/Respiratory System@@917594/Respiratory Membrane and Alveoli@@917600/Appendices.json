A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires the calculation of the total surface area of all alveoli in the human lung, based on an idealized spherical model.\n\nFirst, we establish the formula for the surface area of a single sphere. The surface area, $A_{single}$, of a sphere with radius $r$ is given by the geometric formula:\n$$A_{single} = 4\\pi r^2$$\n\nThe problem states that the lung contains $N$ such identical alveoli. According to the principle of additivity, the total surface area, $A_{total}$, is the product of the number of alveoli and the surface area of a single alveolus:\n$$A_{total} = N \\times A_{single} = N(4\\pi r^2)$$\n\nNext, we must ensure all quantities are in coherent SI units. The final area is requested in square meters ($\\text{m}^2$), so we must convert the given radius from micrometers ($\\mu\\text{m}$) to meters ($\\text{m}$).\nThe given radius is $r = 100 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$.\nUsing the conversion factor $1 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$:\n$$r = 100 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m} = 1 \\times 10^2 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m} = 1 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{m}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values for $N$ and the converted value for $r$ into the equation for $A_{total}$:\n$$A_{total} = (3 \\times 10^8) \\times 4\\pi (1 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{m})^2$$\n$$A_{total} = (3 \\times 10^8) \\times 4\\pi (1 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{m}^2)$$\n$$A_{total} = 12\\pi \\times 10^{8-8} \\, \\text{m}^2$$\n$$A_{total} = 12\\pi \\, \\text{m}^2$$\n\nTo obtain a numerical value, we use the value of $\\pi \\approx 3.14159265...$:\n$$A_{total} \\approx 12 \\times 3.14159265... \\, \\text{m}^2 \\approx 37.6991118... \\, \\text{m}^2$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures as instructed:\n$$A_{total} \\approx 37.70 \\, \\text{m}^2$$\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the ratio of this computed value to the commonly reported morphometric estimate of $A_{reported} = 70 \\, \\text{m}^2$.\nLet the ratio be denoted by $R$.\n$$R = \\frac{A_{total}}{A_{reported}} = \\frac{12\\pi \\, \\text{m}^2}{70 \\, \\text{m}^2}$$\nThe units cancel out, making the ratio dimensionless as required.\n$$R = \\frac{12\\pi}{70} = \\frac{6\\pi}{35}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value of the ratio:\n$$R \\approx \\frac{37.6991118...}{70} \\approx 0.53855874...$$\nRounding this to three significant figures as instructed:\n$$R \\approx 0.539$$\n\nFinally, a brief explanation for the discrepancy between the calculated area ($A_{total} \\approx 37.70 \\, \\text{m}^2$) and the reported area ($A_{reported} = 70 \\, \\text{m}^2$) is required.\nThe discrepancy arises primarily because the idealized spherical model oversimplifies the complex lung architecture. Real alveoli are more accurately described as polyhedral or polygonal shapes that pack tightly together, sharing walls (interalveolar septa), which provides a larger surface area for a given volume compared to isolated spheres. Furthermore, the reported value of $70 \\, \\text{m}^2$ is an average that may correspond to a different state of lung inflation or accounts for the intricate folding of the alveolar surface, factors not captured by a model with a single, fixed radius for all alveoli.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.539}$$", "id": "5149466"}, {"introduction": "Maintaining the vast surface area of millions of tiny alveoli presents a significant physical challenge, as surface tension at the air-liquid interface creates a pressure that tends to collapse smaller structures.

The scenario described—an increase in membrane thickness due to edema and an increase in surface area due to alveolar recruitment—is a physiologically realistic combination of pathological and compensatory processes. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and relationships to arrive at a unique quantitative solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is free of the flaws listed in the validation criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Solution\n\nThe solution is derived by combining the foundational principles provided.\n\nFirst, we state Fick’s first law for steady-state diffusion. The rate of transfer of gas, or flow $\\dot{V}_{\\text{gas}}$, across a planar barrier of area $A$ is proportional to the area and the concentration gradient $\\frac{dC}{dx}$. The diffusion coefficient $D$ is the constant of proportionality.\n$$ \\dot{V}_{\\text{gas}} = -D A \\frac{dC}{dx} $$\nFor a barrier of uniform thickness $T$ with concentration $C_1$ on one side and $C_2$ on the other, the gradient can be approximated as $\\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{C_2 - C_1}{T}$. Assuming flow occurs from the region of higher concentration ($C_1$) to lower concentration ($C_2$), we can write the magnitude of the flow as:\n$$ \\dot{V}_{\\text{gas}} = D A \\frac{C_1 - C_2}{T} $$\n\nNext, we use Henry's law to relate the concentration $C$ of a gas dissolved in a fluid to its partial pressure $P$ in the gas phase. The relationship is $C = \\alpha P$, where $\\alpha$ is the solubility coefficient of the gas. Applying this to the concentrations on both sides of the respiratory membrane (alveolar side and capillary side):\n$$ C_1 = \\alpha P_1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad C_2 = \\alpha P_2 $$\nwhere $P_1$ is the alveolar partial pressure and $P_2$ is the capillary partial pressure.\n\nSubstituting these expressions for concentration into the Fick's law equation yields an expression for gas flow in terms of partial pressures:\n$$ \\dot{V}_{\\text{gas}} = D A \\frac{\\alpha P_1 - \\alpha P_2}{T} = \\frac{D \\alpha A}{T} (P_1 - P_2) $$\n\nThe problem defines the diffusing capacity of the lung, $D_L$, as the proportionality constant between the gas flow and the partial pressure difference across the membrane:\n$$ \\dot{V}_{\\text{gas}} = D_L (P_1 - P_2) $$\n\nBy comparing the two preceding equations for $\\dot{V}_{\\text{gas}}$, we can derive the expression for $D_L$ in terms of the physical properties of the membrane:\n$$ D_L (P_1 - P_2) = \\frac{D \\alpha A}{T} (P_1 - P_2) $$\nThis yields the desired relationship:\n$$ D_L = \\frac{D \\alpha A}{T} $$\nThis equation shows that the diffusing capacity is directly proportional to the gas diffusivity $D$, its solubility $\\alpha$, and the surface area of the membrane $A$, and it is inversely proportional to the thickness of the membrane $T$.\n\nNow, we can compute the effect of the specified changes. The initial diffusing capacity is $D_L$. The final diffusing capacity, $D_L^{\\prime}$, is determined by the new area $A^{\\prime}$ and new thickness $T^{\\prime}$. Since $D$ and $\\alpha$ are constant:\n$$ D_{L}^{\\prime} = \\frac{D \\alpha A^{\\prime}}{T^{\\prime}} $$\nWe are given the relationships $A^{\\prime} = 1.25 A$ and $T^{\\prime} = 2T$.
