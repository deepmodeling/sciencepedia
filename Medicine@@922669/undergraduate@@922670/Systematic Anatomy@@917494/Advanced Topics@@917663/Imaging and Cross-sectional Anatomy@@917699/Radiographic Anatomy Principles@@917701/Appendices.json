Let $W$ be the projected width of the heart on the image detector and $W_{0}$ be the true transverse width of the heart. Let $\\text{SID}$ be the source-to-image distance and $\\text{SOD}$ be the source-to-object distance. The geometry of projection forms two similar triangles.

The principle of magnification, as demonstrated mathematically above, shows that the apparent size of an object increases as its distance from the image detector (the $\\text{OID}$) increases.\n\nThis principle creates a critical difference between posteroanterior (PA) and anteroposterior (AP) chest radiographs.\n1.  **PA Projection:** The standard for chest radiography is the PA view, where the X-ray beam enters the patient's posterior aspect and exits the anterior aspect to strike an image detector placed against the anterior chest. The human heart is situated in the anterior portion of the thoracic cavity. In a PA projection, the heart is close to the detector, minimizing its $\\text{OID}$. This results in a projected cardiac silhouette with minimal magnification, providing a more accurate representation of its true size.\n\n2.  **AP Projection:** Portable chest radiographs are typically performed in the AP projection, especially for bedridden patients. The X-ray source is in front of the patient, and the detector is placed behind the back. In this configuration, the anteriorly located heart is significantly farther from the detector, resulting in a large $\\text{OID}$.\n\nThe **cardiothoracic ratio (CTR)**, defined as the ratio of the maximum transverse cardiac diameter to the maximum internal thoracic diameter, is a common metric used to assess for cardiomegaly (enlarged heart). A CTR exceeding $0.5$ is often considered abnormal.\n\nThe diagnostic bias arises because the increased $\\text{OID}$ in an AP projection causes significant magnification of the heart shadow. As calculated in Part 1, a mere $10\\,\\text{cm}$ increase in $\\text{OID}$ can increase the apparent cardiac width by nearly $1\\,\\text{cm}$. This magnification artificially inflates the numerator of the CTR. Consequently, a patient with a normal-sized heart may exhibit a CTR greater than $0.5$ on an AP film, leading to a false-positive diagnosis of cardiomegaly (a condition known as pseudo-cardiomegaly). For this reason, the CTR is considered a reliable indicator of heart size only on a standard PA chest film. On AP films, the cardiac silhouette is known to be magnified, and any assessment of cardiomegaly must be made with extreme caution, taking the projection geometry into full account.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.926}$$", "id": "5147757"}, {"introduction": "Modern medical imaging, particularly Computed Tomography (CT), captures a vast range of tissue attenuation data, measured in Hounsfield Units ($HU$).
