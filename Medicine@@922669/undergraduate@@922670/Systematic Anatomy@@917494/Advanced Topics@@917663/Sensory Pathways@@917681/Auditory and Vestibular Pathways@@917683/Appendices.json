This process relies on subtle cues, including the miniscule difference in the arrival time of a sound at your two ears, known as the Interaural Time Difference (ITD).

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for three components: a derivation of the Interaural Time Difference (ITD) formula, a numerical evaluation for specific parameters, and an analysis of front-back ambiguity.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Interaural Time Difference (ITD)**\n\nWe begin by establishing a geometric framework. Let the center of the head be at the origin $(0, 0)$ of a $2$-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system representing the horizontal plane. The interaural axis is aligned with the x-axis. The left ear (L) is located at $(-\\frac{d}{2}, 0)$ and the right ear (R) is at $(\\frac{d}{2}, 0)$, where $d$ is the interaural distance. The vector pointing from the left ear to the right ear is thus $\\vec{d} = (\\frac{d}{2} - (-\\frac{d}{2}), 0-0) = (d, 0)$.\n\nThe problem defines the straight-ahead direction as the reference for the azimuthal angle $\\theta$. We align this direction with the positive y-axis. Therefore, an angle of $\\theta = 0^\\circ$ corresponds to a sound source directly in front. The angle $\\theta$ is measured from the y-axis, with positive values toward the right (positive x-axis).\n\nA planar acoustic wave from the far-field propagates with a speed $c$. The direction of propagation is given by the wavefront normal vector, $\\hat{k}$. Since the source is at an azimuth $\\theta$ relative to the straight-ahead direction (the y-axis), the components of this unit vector are given by standard trigonometry:\n$$\n\\hat{k} = (\\sin\\theta, \\cos\\theta)\n$$\nWe can verify this choice of coordinates. For a source straight ahead ($\\theta=0^\\circ$), $\\hat{k} = (\\sin 0^\\circ, \\cos 0^\\circ) = (0, 1)$, which is along the y-axis. For a source directly to the right ($\\theta=90^\\circ$), $\\hat{k} = (\\sin 90^\\circ, \\cos 90^\\circ) = (1, 0)$, which is along the x-axis. This corresponds correctly to the geometric setup.\n\nThe path length difference, $\\Delta L$, to the two ears is the projection of the interaural vector $\\vec{d}$ onto the direction of wave propagation $\\hat{k}$. This projection is calculated using the dot product:\n$$\n\\Delta L = \\vec{d} \\cdot \\hat{k}\n$$\nSubstituting the vectors:\n$$\n\\Delta L = (d, 0) \\cdot (\\sin\\theta, \\cos\\theta) = d \\sin\\theta + 0 \\cdot \\cos\\theta = d \\sin\\theta\n$$\nA positive $\\Delta L$ (for $0^\\circ < \\theta < 180^\\circ$) indicates that the path to the left ear is longer than the path to the right ear, meaning the sound arrives at the right ear first. Conversely, a negative $\\Delta L$ (for $-180^\\circ < \\theta < 0^\\circ$) means the sound arrives at the left ear first.\n\nThe Interaural Time Difference (ITD) is defined as the time it takes for the sound to travel this extra distance $\\Delta L$. Using the fundamental relationship time = distance / speed, we have:\n$$\n\\text{ITD}(\\theta) = \\frac{\\Delta L}{c}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta L$, we arrive at the desired function for ITD:\n$$\n\\text{ITD}(\\theta) = \\frac{d \\sin\\theta}{c}\n$$\nThis formula provides the ITD as a function of the interaural distance $d$, the speed of sound $c$, and the azimuthal angle $\\theta$.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the ITD for the following parameters:\n- Azimuthal angle, $\\theta = 30^\\circ$\n- Interaural distance, $d = 0.18\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Speed of sound, $c = 343\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n\nWe use the derived formula:\n$$\n\\text{ITD}(30^\\circ) = \\frac{(0.18\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\sin(30^\\circ)}{343\\,\\mathrm{m/s}}\n$$\nThe sine of $30^\\circ$ is a known value, $\\sin(30^\\circ) = 0.5$.\n$$\n\\text{ITD}(30^\\circ) = \\frac{0.18 \\times 0.5}{343}\\,\\mathrm{s} = \\frac{0.09}{343}\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nPerforming the division gives the result in seconds:\n$$\n\\text{ITD}(30^\\circ) \\approx 0.00026239067\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in milliseconds ($\\mathrm{ms}$) and rounded to four significant figures. To convert from seconds to milliseconds, we multiply by $1000$:\n$$\n\\text{ITD}(30^\\circ) \\approx 0.26239067\\,\\mathrm{ms}\n$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures yields:\n$$\n\\text{ITD}(30^\\circ) \\approx 0.2624\\,\\mathrm{ms}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Analysis of Front-Back Ambiguity**\n\nThe final task is to analyze whether the ITD cue alone can distinguish between a sound source in the front versus one in the back. This analysis relies on the symmetry of the derived ITD function, $\\text{ITD}(\\theta) = \\frac{d \\sin\\theta}{c}$.\n\nConsider a sound source at an angle $\\theta$ in the front hemisphere (let's say $0^\\circ < \\theta < 90^\\circ$). A symmetrically located point in the rear hemisphere, with respect to the interaural axis (the x-axis), would be at an angle of $180^\\circ - \\theta$. Let's calculate the ITD for this rear position:\n$$\n\\text{ITD}(180^\\circ - \\theta) = \\frac{d \\sin(180^\\circ - \\theta)}{c}\n$$\nWe use the trigonometric identity $\\sin(180^\\circ - \\alpha) = \\sin(\\alpha)$. Applying this identity, we find:\n$$\n\\text{ITD}(180^\\circ - \\theta) = \\frac{d \\sin\\theta}{c} = \\text{ITD}(\\theta)\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that a source at angle $\\theta$ and a source at angle $180^\\circ - \\theta$ produce the exact same Interaural Time Difference. For the specific case of $\\theta=30^\\circ$, the symmetric location in the back is at $180^\\circ - 30^\\circ = 150^\\circ$. Both $\\sin(30^\\circ)$ and $\\sin(150^\\circ)$ are equal to $0.5$, yielding identical ITD values.\n\nTherefore, within this simplified geometric model, the ITD cue alone is insufficient to disambiguate between front and back sound sources. For any given ITD value (except for the maximum at $\\theta = \\pm 90^\\circ$ and zero at $\\theta=0^\\circ, 180^\\circ$), there are two possible source directions in the horizontal plane, one in front and one in back, that are symmetric with respect to the interaural axis.
