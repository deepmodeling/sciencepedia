The provided physiological values are standard for a healthy adult. The scenario describes the primary effect of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) on water balance, a fundamental concept in renal physiology and endocrinology.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe core principle for solving this problem is the conservation of the total amount of solute (exchangeable sodium) within the total body water. Let $N_{Na}$ represent the total moles of exchangeable sodium in the body. The concentration $C$ of a solute is defined as the amount of solute $N$ per unit volume $V$ of the solvent.\n\n$$C = \\frac{N}{V}$$\n\nInitially, before the water gain, the state of the system is defined by the initial volume $V_0$ and the initial concentration $C_0$. The total amount of exchangeable sodium, $N_{Na,0}$, can be calculated as:\n\n$$N_{Na,0} = C_0 \\times V_0$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$N_{Na,0} = (140\\,\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}) \\times (40\\,\\mathrm{L}) = 5600\\,\\mathrm{mmol}$$\n\nThe problem states that an acute gain of pure water, $\\Delta V$, occurs without any change in the total exchangeable sodium content. This is a key condition. Therefore, the final amount of sodium, $N_{Na,1}$, is equal to the initial amount, $N_{Na,0}$.\n\n$$N_{Na,1} = N_{Na,0} = 5600\\,\\mathrm{mmol}$$\n\nThe new total body water volume, $V_1$, is the sum of the initial volume and the volume of water gained.\n\n$$V_1 = V_0 + \\Delta V$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$V_1 = 40\\,\\mathrm{L} + 1\\,\\mathrm{L} = 41\\,\\mathrm{L}$$\n\nThe new plasma sodium concentration, $C_1$, can now be calculated using the final amount of sodium and the final volume.\n\n$$C_1 = \\frac{N_{Na,1}}{V_1}$$\n\nBy substituting the expressions for $N_{Na,1}$ and $V_1$, we derive a general formula for the new concentration:\n\n$$C_1 = \\frac{C_0 V_0}{V_0 + \\Delta V}$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $C_1$ using the given data.\n\n$$C_1 = \\frac{5600\\,\\mathrm{mmol}}{41\\,\\mathrm{L}}$$\n\n$$C_1 \\approx 136.58536585... \\,\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
