The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe total perceptual latency ($T$) for a signal to travel from the receptor to the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is the sum of the total axonal conduction time ($T_{cond}$) and the total synaptic delay time ($T_{syn}$).\n\nThe governing equation is:\n$$T = T_{cond} + T_{syn}$$\n\nThe axonal conduction time is the path length $L$ divided by the conduction velocity $v$:\n$$T_{cond} = \\frac{L}{v}$$\n\nThe total synaptic delay is the number of synapses $n_s$ multiplied by the delay per synapse $\\tau_s$:\n$$T_{syn} = n_s \\times \\tau_s$$\n\nTherefore, the total latency for each modality is:\n$$T = \\frac{L}{v} + n_s \\tau_s$$\n\nTo find the \"earliest plausible perceptual latency,\" we must minimize $T$. Since $L$, $n_s$, and $\\tau_s$ are fixed for each modality, $T$ is minimized when the conduction time $T_{cond}$ is minimized. This occurs when the conduction velocity $v$ is maximized. We will use the maximum velocity ($v_{max}$) from the provided range for each fiber type.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n-   $L = 1.2$ $\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $\\tau_s = 1$ $\\mathrm{ms} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}$ $\\mathrm{s}$\n\n**1.

This falls squarely within the stated range of \"$40$–$50$ $\\mathrm{ms}$\".\n-   **Slow Pain Latency:** The calculated value is $0.603$ $\\mathrm{s}$. \"Approximately $0.6$ $\\mathrm{s}$\" is an excellent approximation.\n-   **Order:** The stated order, Touch $\\rightarrow$ Fast Pain $\\rightarrow$ Slow Pain, matches our derived order.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.

Touch perceived at approximately $20$ $\\mathrm{ms}$, fast pain at approximately $0.2$ $\\mathrm{s}$, and slow burning pain at approximately $2$–$3$ $\\mathrm{s}$; ordered Touch $\\rightarrow$ Fast Pain $\\rightarrow$ Slow Pain.**\n-   **Touch Latency:** The value of $\\approx 20$ $\\mathrm{ms}$ is consistent with our calculation of $18$ $\\mathrm{ms}$.\n-   **Fast Pain Latency:** The value of $\\approx 0.2$ $\\mathrm{s}$ ($200$ $\\mathrm{ms}$) is highly inconsistent with the \"earliest plausible\" latency of $43$ $\\mathrm{ms}$. This value would arise from using the *slowest* A$\\delta$ velocity ($v_{min} = 5$ $\\mathrm{m/s}$), which gives $T = (1.2/5) + 0.003 = 0.24 + 0.003 = 0.243$ $\\mathrm{s}$, contradicting the problem's instruction.\n-   **Slow Pain Latency:** The value of $\\approx 2$–$3$ $\\mathrm{s}$ is inconsistent with the \"earliest plausible\" latency of $0.603$ $\\mathrm{s}$. This range corresponds to the *slowest* C fiber velocity ($v_{min} = 0.5$ $\\mathrm{m/s}$), which gives $T = (1.2/0.5) + 0.003 = 2.4 + 0.003 = 2.403$ $\\mathrm{s}$. This again violates the premise of finding the earliest latency.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. It misinterprets \"earliest\" as \"latest\" for the pain modalities.\n\n**D.

The slow pain value ($\\approx 0.6~\\mathrm{s}$) is correct, but this does not salvage the option.\n-   **Order:** The explicitly stated order \"Touch $\\rightarrow$ Slow Pain $\\rightarrow$ Fast Pain\" is physiologically impossible and factually incorrect. It also contradicts the numerical latencies given within the option itself ($100 \\text{ ms}  500 \\text{ ms}  600 \\text{ ms}$ implies Touch $\\rightarrow$ Fast Pain $\\rightarrow$ Slow Pain).

The scenario is a standard and valid problem in clinical neuroanatomy.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a specific lesion (right hemisection at $T_{10}$), a set of rules governing the relevant neural pathway, and a clear question regarding the resulting sensory deficit. The use of ranges (e.g., \"$1$–$2$ segments\") introduces a degree of approximation, but this is consistent with biological variability and the options are phrased in a way that accommodates this (e.g., \"approximately\"). A logical and unique conclusion about the nature of the deficit can be derived.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective anatomical and clinical language, free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a self-contained set of principles from which to derive a logical conclusion. I will now proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the sensory deficit for pain and temperature resulting from a right hemisection of the spinal cord at level $T_{10}$. We must trace the path of sensory information from various dermatomes relative to this lesion, using only the two principles provided. The key pathway is the anterolateral system (ALS), also known as the spinothalamic tract for pain and temperature.\n\n1.  **Identify the Interrupted Tract:** The lesion is a right hemisection at $T_{10}$. This will destroy all tracts within the right half of the spinal cord at this specific level. For pain and temperature, the critical tract is the right anterolateral system (ALS). According to Principle 2, the ALS contains second-order neurons that have crossed from the *contralateral* (left) side of the spinal cord. Therefore, the lesion at the right $T_{10}$ level will primarily affect sensation from the left side of the body.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Contralateral (Left) Side:** Let us trace the pathway for afferents entering from the left side of the body at different spinal levels.\n    -   Consider a primary afferent from a dermatome well below the lesion, for instance, left $L_1$. It enters the spinal cord at the left $L_1$ dorsal root.\n    -   Per Principle 1, it synapses in the ipsilateral (left) dorsal horn at a level between approximately $L_1$ and $T_{11}$ (ascending $0$ to $2$ segments in Lissauer's tract).\n    -   Per Principle 2, the second-order neuron originating from this synapse decussates (crosses to the right side) via the anterior white commissure $1$–$2$ segments rostral to its dorsal root entry level ($L_1$). This means the crossing occurs around segment $T_{12}$ or $T_{11}$.\n    -   After crossing, the fiber ascends in the *right* ALS. As this fiber travels up the cord, it reaches the $T_{10}$ level, where the right hemisection exists. The fiber is transected by the lesion.\n    -   Therefore, pain and temperature sensation from the left $L_1$ dermatome will be lost. This logic applies to all dermatomes below this level.\n\n3.  **Determine the Rostral Onset of the Contralateral Deficit:** We must find the highest dermatome on the left side that is spared, which will define the upper border of the sensory loss.\n    -   **Left $T_{12}$ dermatome:** Afferents enter at $T_{12}$. Per Principle 2, they cross $1$–$2$ segments rostral, at $T_{11}$ or $T_{10}$. If they cross at $T_{11}$, they ascend in the right ALS and are cut at $T_{10}$. If they cross at $T_{10}$, the decussating fibers themselves are caught in the right-sided lesion. In either case, sensation from left $T_{12}$ is lost.\n    -   **Left $T_{11}$ dermatome:** Afferents enter at $T_{11}$. They cross $1$–$2$ segments rostral, at $T_{10}$ or $T_9$. Fibers crossing at $T_{10}$ will be cut by the lesion. Fibers crossing at $T_9$ will be above the lesion and thus spared. Therefore, sensation from left $T_{11}$ may be partially or completely lost.\n    -   **Left $T_{10}$ dermatome:** Afferents enter at $T_{10}$. They cross $1$–$2$ segments rostral, at $T_9$ or $T_8$. The decussation and subsequent ascent in the right ALS occur entirely rostral (superior) to the $T_{10}$ lesion. These pathways are therefore intact. Sensation from the left $T_{10}$ dermatome is spared.\n\n    **Conclusion for Contralateral Side:** There is a loss of pain and temperature sensation on the left side of the body. This loss begins definitively around segment $T_{12}$ and continues downwards. The dermatomes corresponding to spinal levels $T_{10}$ and $T_{11}$ are relatively or completely spared. This \"sensory level\" being a few segments below the anatomical lesion is a classic consequence of the delayed decussation of the ALS.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Ipsilateral (Right) Side:**\n    -   For dermatomes below the lesion (e.g., right $L_1$), the primary afferents enter, synapse in the right dorsal horn, and the second-order neurons cross to the *left* ALS. The left ALS is completely untouched by the right hemisection at $T_{10}$. Therefore, pain and temperature sensation from the right side of the body *below* the lesion level is preserved.\n    -   At the level of the lesion (right $T_{10}$), the primary afferents enter the right dorsal root. However, the lesion has destroyed the right dorsal horn at $T_{10}$. Per Principle 1, these fibers travel in Lissauer's tract and can ascend or descend $0-2$ segments. The primary afferent fibers themselves and the dorsal horn grey matter at $T_{10}$ are destroyed. This causes a loss of sensation at the ipsilateral $T_{10}$ dermatome. This may extend to adjacent dermatomes (e.g., $T_9$, $T_{11}$) whose primary afferents are damaged as they pass through the $T_{10}$ segment in Lissauer's tract. This creates a narrow \"band\" of ipsilateral sensory loss at and around the level of the lesion.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Overall Deficit:** The major, extensive sensory deficit is a contralateral (left-sided) loss of pain and temperature starting approximately $1$–$2$ segments below the lesion level (i.e., around $T_{12}$ and downwards). There is also a small band of ipsilateral (right-sided) loss at the level of the lesion. The question asks for the description of the deficit, and the most significant and defining feature is the contralateral loss.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Predominantly contralateral (left) loss of pain and temperature that begins approximately $1$–$2$ segments below $T_{10}$ (from about $T_{12}$ downward), with relative sparing at $T_{10}$–$T_{11}$ because of delayed decussation through the anterior white commissure.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with our derivation.\n-   It correctly identifies the deficit as \"predominantly contralateral (left)\".\n-   It correctly places the onset of the deficit at \"approximately $1$–$2$ segments below $T_{10}$ (from about $T_{12}$ downward)\".\n-   It correctly notes the \"relative sparing at $T_{10}$–$T_{11}$\".\n-   It provides the correct reason: \"delayed decussation\".\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Predominantly ipsilateral (right) loss of pain and temperature beginning at and below $T_{10}$ because spinothalamic fibers have not yet crossed at this level.**\nThis is incorrect. The extensive loss is contralateral, not ipsilateral. The reason provided is also flawed; the fibers that are damaged are precisely those that *have* already crossed from the contralateral side and are ascending in the ipsilateral ALS.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Contralateral (left) loss of pain and temperature confined to the $T_{10}$ dermatome only, with normal sensation below, because decussation occurs immediately at the segment of entry.**\nThis is incorrect. A lesion of an ascending tract affects all dermatomes whose fibers have entered that tract below the lesion level; the deficit is not confined to a single dermatome. Furthermore, the reason given (\"decussation occurs immediately\") directly contradicts Principle 2 provided in the problem statement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Bilateral symmetric loss of pain and temperature below $T_{10}$ because second-order neurons cross and then re-cross over multiple segments within the anterior white commissure.**\nThis is incorrect. A unilateral lesion (hemisection) produces an asymmetric deficit, not a symmetric one.

We analyze each finding to build a complete picture.\n\n**1. Determine the Side of the Lesion (Right vs. Left)**\n\n*   **Vibration and Joint Position Sense (Proprioception):** The patient has lost these modalities on the **right** side. This information travels in the **dorsal columns**, which ascend **ipsilaterally** (on the same side). Therefore, the loss on the right implies a lesion in the **right dorsal column**.\n*   **Motor Function:** The patient has upper motor neuron (UMN) signs (hyperreflexia, extensor plantar response) in the **right** lower limb. These signs are due to damage to the **corticospinal tract**. In the spinal cord, this tract is also predominantly **ipsilateral**. Therefore, the signs on the right imply a lesion in the **right corticospinal tract**.\n*   **Pain and Temperature Sensation:** The patient has lost these modalities on the **left** side. This information travels in the **anterolateral system (spinothalamic tract)**. Fibers of this pathway **decussate** (cross the midline) in the spinal cord. Therefore, a loss of sensation on the left implies a lesion in the **contralateral (right) anterolateral system**.\n\n**Conclusion on Side:** All three key findings point consistently to a lesion in the **right half** of the spinal cord. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n**2. Determine the Segmental Level of the Lesion**\n\n*   The sensory level for all deficits is given as beginning at the **$T_{10}$ dermatome**.\n*   The key to pinpointing the level is the anatomy of the anterolateral system. Second-order neurons in this pathway ascend for 1 to 2 segments *before* they cross the midline. This means a lesion at a given spinal segment `X` will cause a loss of pain and temperature sensation on the contralateral side starting approximately 1 to 2 dermatomes *below* `X` (i.e., at dermatome `X+1` or `X+2`).\n*   Working backward: The patient has a contralateral sensory level for pain and temperature at dermatome **$T_{10}$**. This means the lesion must be located approximately **1 to 2 segments above** the $T_{10}$ spinal segment.\n*   Calculation: Lesion Level ≈ Sensory Level - 2 segments = $T_{10}$ - 2 = **$T_8$**.\n*   Let's verify this. A right hemisection at spinal segment **$T_8$** would:\n    *   Damage the right dorsal columns, causing ipsilateral loss of vibration/proprioception at and below $T_8$. A sensory level manifesting at $T_{10}$ is consistent with this.\n    *   Damage the right corticospinal tract, causing ipsilateral UMN signs below $T_8$. This is consistent with the right lower limb findings.\n    *   Damage the right anterolateral system at $T_8$. This tract contains fibers from the left side of the body. The fibers from the left $T_{10}$ dermatome enter at spinal level $T_{10}$, ascend to about $T_8$, and are then interrupted as they cross. Fibers from below $T_{10}$ would also be interrupted. This would produce a contralateral sensory loss beginning at the $T_{10}$ dermatome.\n\n**Conclusion on Level:** The neurological findings, particularly the contralateral sensory level at $T_{10}$, strongly indicate a lesion at the **$T_8$ spinal segment**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A. Right hemisection at $T_8$**: This matches our derived side (right) and level ($T_8$). **Correct**.\n*   **B. Left hemisection at $T_8$**: Incorrect side.\n*   **C. Right hemisection at $T_{10}$**: Correct side, but incorrect level. A lesion at $T_{10}$ would result in a contralateral sensory loss beginning around $T_{12}$ or $L_1$, not $T_{10}$.\n*   **D. Left hemisection at $T_{10}$**: Incorrect side and level.\n*   **E. Right hemisection at $T_9$**: Correct side. A lesion at $T_9$ would typically cause a contralateral sensory level at $T_{10}$ or $T_{11}$. While plausible, $T_8$ is the more classic and precise answer based on the \"2-segment rule\" often taught for localization. Given the options, $T_8$ is the best fit.\n\nTherefore, the most likely location of the lesion is a right hemisection at the $T_8$ spinal segment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4523805"}]}
