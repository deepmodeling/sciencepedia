The question is objective and precisely formulated. No scientific, logical, or structural flaws are detected.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem describes two pathways for blood flow arranged in parallel: the intrahepatic pathway (subscript $h$) and the collateral pathway (subscript $c$). In a parallel flow arrangement, the pressure drop, $\\Delta P$, across each pathway is identical.\n\nLet $Q_h$ and $Q_c$ be the volumetric flow rates through the intrahepatic and collateral pathways, respectively. The total portal inflow, $Q_{total}$, is the sum of the flows through the individual pathways:\n$$Q_{total} = Q_h + Q_c$$\n\nAccording to the fluid dynamics analogue of Ohm's law, the pressure drop across a pathway is the product of its flow rate and hydraulic resistance, $R$:\n$$\\Delta P = Q R$$\n\nSince the pressure drop is the same for both pathways:\n$$\\Delta P = Q_h R_h = Q_c R_c$$\nwhere $R_h$ and $R_c$ are the hydraulic resistances of the intrahepatic and collateral pathways, respectively. From this relationship, we can express $Q_h$ in terms of $Q_c$:\n$$Q_h = Q_c \\frac{R_c}{R_h}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the fractional portal flow through the collateral pathway, which we denote as $F_c$. This is defined as the ratio of the collateral flow to the total flow:\n$$F_c = \\frac{Q_c}{Q_{total}}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $Q_{total}$ and $Q_h$ into the definition of $F_c$:\n$$F_c = \\frac{Q_c}{Q_h + Q_c} = \\frac{Q_c}{Q_c \\frac{R_c}{R_h} + Q_c}$$\n\nFactoring out $Q_c$ from the denominator (assuming $Q_c \\neq 0$):\n$$F_c = \\frac{Q_c}{Q_c \\left(\\frac{R_c}{R_h} + 1\\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{R_c}{R_h} + 1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{R_c + R_h}{R_h}} = \\frac{R_h}{R_h + R_c}$$\nThis is the general expression for the fractional flow through the collateral pathway based on the resistances.\n\nNext, we use the provided Poiseuille’s law for resistance:\n$$R = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^{4}}$$\nThe resistances for the two pathways are:\n$$R_h = \\frac{8 \\eta L_h}{\\pi r_h^4}$$\n$$R_c = \\frac{8 \\eta L_c}{\\pi r_c^4}$$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $F_c$:\n$$F_c = \\frac{\\frac{8 \\eta L_h}{\\pi r_h^4}}{\\frac{8 \\eta L_h}{\\pi r_h^4} + \\frac{8 \\eta L_c}{\\pi r_c^4}}$$\n\nThe constant factor $\\frac{8 \\eta}{\\pi}$ cancels out from the numerator and denominator, indicating that the fractional flow is independent of the fluid's viscosity, provided it is the same in both pathways.\n$$F_c = \\frac{\\frac{L_h}{r_h^4}}{\\frac{L_h}{r_h^4} + \\frac{L_c}{r_c^4}}$$\nThis can be rearranged by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $r_h^4 r_c^4$ to obtain:\n$$F_c = \\frac{L_h r_c^4}{L_h r_c^4 + L_c r_h^4}$$\n\nThe problem requires us to compute this fraction after the collateral vessel radius doubles. Let the new state be denoted by a prime symbol ($'$). The new collateral radius is $r'_c = 2 r_c$. All other parameters remain the same ($L_h$, $r_h$, $L_c$). The new fractional flow through the collateral, $F'_c$, is:\n$$F'_c = \\frac{L_h (r'_c)^4}{L_h (r'_c)^4 + L_c r_h^4} = \\frac{L_h (2 r_c)^4}{L_h (2 r_c)^4 + L_c r_h^4}$$\n$$F'_c = \\frac{16 L_h r_c^4}{16 L_h r_c^4 + L_c r_h^4}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n-   $L_h = 0.10\\,\\text{m}$\n-   $r_h = 0.0008\\,\\text{m} = 8 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{m}$\n-   $L_c = 0.20\\,\\text{m}$\n-   $r_c = 0.0015\\,\\text{m} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$\n\nWe calculate the two terms in the expression for $F'_c$.\nThe term related to the collateral pathway is:\n$$16 L_h r_c^4 = 16 \\times (0.10) \\times (1.5 \\times 10^{-3})^4 = 1.6 \\times (1.5^4 \\times 10^{-12}) = 1.6 \\times (5.0625 \\times 10^{-12}) = 8.1 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{m}^5$$\nThe term related to the hepatic pathway is:\n$$L_c r_h^4 = (0.20) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-4})^4 = 0.2 \\times (8^4 \\times 10^{-16}) = 0.2 \\times (4096 \\times 10^{-16}) = 819.2 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\text{m}^5 = 8.192 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\text{m}^5$$\n\nNow, we compute the fractional flow $F'_c$:\n$$F'_c = \\frac{16 L_h r_c^4}{16 L_h r_c^4 + L_c r_h^4} = \\frac{8.1 \\times 10^{-12}}{8.1 \\times 10^{-12} + 8.192 \\times 10^{-14}}$$\nTo perform the addition in the denominator, we express both terms with the same power of $10$:\n$$8.192 \\times 10^{-14} = 0.08192 \\times 10^{-12}$$\nSo, the denominator is:\n$$8.1 \\times 10^{-12} + 0.08192 \\times 10^{-12} = 8.18192 \\times 10^{-12}$$\nFinally, we compute the ratio:\n$$F'_c = \\frac{8.1 \\times 10^{-12}}{8.18192 \\times 10^{-12}} = \\frac{8.1}{8.18192} \\approx 0.9899877$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as requested:\n$$F'_c \\approx 0.9900$$\nThis result demonstrates that due to the $r^4$ dependence of flow in Poiseuille's law, even a modest increase in the radius of a collateral vessel can cause a dramatic diversion of portal flow away from the liver, a key pathophysiological feature of portal hypertension.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9900}$$", "id": "5146246"}, {"introduction": "While the formation of varices provides an essential outlet for high portal pressure, it also creates a risk of life-threatening hemorrhage.

All parameters and conditions are stated objectively.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. I will now proceed to the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe pathophysiology of portal hypertension can be understood using an analogy from electrical circuits, based on Ohm's law for fluid dynamics: $\\Delta P = Q \\times R$, where $\\Delta P$ is the pressure gradient, $Q$ is the blood flow, and $R$ is the resistance.\n\nIn this case:\n*   $\\Delta P$ is the portal pressure gradient, measured as the HVPG, which is given as $12\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n*   $Q$ is the total splanchnic blood inflow into the portal system. The problem states this remains elevated.\n*   $R$ is the total resistance to outflow from the portal system into the systemic circulation.\n\nThe outflow from the portal system occurs through multiple parallel pathways:\n1.  The liver itself (via the sinusoids), which has pathologically high resistance ($R_{liver}$) due to cirrhosis.\n2.  Various collateral channels (varices), such as the esophagogastric pathway ($R_{esoph}$), the paraumbilical pathway ($R_{para}$), the retroperitoneal pathway ($R_{retro}$), and the rectal pathway ($R_{rectal}$).\n\nThe total resistance ($R_{total}$) of a parallel circuit is given by the formula:\n$$ \\frac{1}{R_{total}} = \\frac{1}{R_{liver}} + \\frac{1}{R_{esoph}} + \\frac{1}{R_{para}} + \\frac{1}{R_{retro}} + \\frac{1}{R_{rectal}} + \\dots $$\nThe total conductance ($1/R_{total}$) is the sum of the individual conductances.\n\nThe intervention is endoscopic band ligation, which functionally obliterates the esophageal varices. This is equivalent to increasing the resistance of that specific pathway ($R_{esoph}$) to a very high value, effectively approaching infinity ($\\infty$). When $R_{esoph} \\to \\infty$, the term $1/R_{esoph} \\to 0$.\n\nLet $R'_{total}$ be the new total resistance after ligation. The new equation for the total resistance is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{R'_{total}} = \\frac{1}{R_{liver}} + \\frac{1}{R_{para}} + \\frac{1}{R_{retro}} + \\frac{1}{R_{rectal}} + \\dots $$\nBy removing a term ($1/R_{esoph}$) from the sum, the total conductance decreases: $1/R'_{total} < 1/R_{total}$. Consequently, the new total resistance increases: $R'_{total} > R_{total}$.\n\nThe problem states that the splanchnic inflow ($Q_{splanchnic}$) remains elevated. According to the relationship $\\Delta P = Q \\times R$, if $Q$ remains high and $R$ increases, the portal pressure gradient ($\\Delta P_{portal} = \\text{HVPG}$) must either remain elevated or, more likely, increase further. The statement in the question prompt \"without altering portal pressure\" should be interpreted as \"without a therapy intended to lower portal pressure,\" meaning the underlying condition of portal hypertension persists.\n\nThe total blood flow ($Q_{splanchnic}$) must now be shunted through the remaining open pathways. Since the total flow is conserved and one major outflow tract has been closed, the flow through the remaining collateral channels ($Q_{para}$, $Q_{retro}$, $Q_{rectal}$, etc.) must increase to accommodate the redistributed blood. Furthermore, the persistent (or increased) high portal pressure will promote the development of new collateral vessels and the enlargement of existing small ones. This includes new vessels feeding the esophagus (leading to recurrence) and other nearby pathways like the short and posterior gastric veins, which can cause dangerous gastric varices.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Portal pressure decreases because the resistance at the banded site increases, making recurrence of esophageal varices unlikely and reducing global collateral flow.**\n*   **Analysis:** Increasing resistance in a parallel pathway *increases*, not decreases, the total resistance of the circuit. With constant inflow, this leads to an *increase*, not a decrease, in the driving pressure. The continued high pressure is precisely why varices are prone to recur. The flow is not globally reduced; it is redistributed, increasing flow in other collateral channels.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Portal pressure remains elevated; esophageal varices tend to recur over time due to persistent high gradient, and collateral blood redistributes to other portal-systemic anastomoses (for example, short gastric and posterior gastric routes, paraumbilical, and retroperitoneal pathways), increasing the risk of gastric or ectopic varices.**\n*   **Analysis:** This statement correctly identifies all key consequences. The portal pressure remains pathologically elevated because the underlying liver disease and high inflow are untreated. The persistent high-pressure gradient is the stimulus for variceal recurrence. Blocking one outflow path (esophageal) forces the blood to find alternative routes, leading to redistribution. This redistribution increases flow and pressure in other collateral beds, such as the short/posterior gastric veins (leading to gastric varices) and other systemic anastomoses.\n*   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Band ligation transforms the condition into prehepatic portal hypertension by adding resistance at the variceal site; ascites may worsen, but varices cannot recur.**\n*   **Analysis:** The classification of portal hypertension is based on the primary site of obstruction. Here, the primary site remains the liver (intrahepatic). Adding resistance downstream in a collateral channel does not change the primary pathology to prehepatic (e.g., portal vein thrombosis). The claim that \"varices cannot recur\" is fundamentally incorrect and contradicts extensive clinical evidence. The driving force for their formation remains.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Removal of one parallel collateral pathway increases systemic venous return and reduces splanchnic inflow, thereby lowering the hepatic venous pressure gradient and improving portal hypertensive gastropathy.**\n*   **Analysis:** This option makes several false claims. It directly contradicts the problem's explicit assumption that \"splanchnic inflow continues to be elevated\". A reduction in outflow paths with constant inflow would raise, not lower, the HVPG. An increased HVPG would worsen, not improve, portal hypertensive gastropathy.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Persistent portal hypertension preferentially diverts flow to the superior rectal-to-internal iliac pathway, increasing hemorrhoids while esophageal varices do not recur.**\n*   **Analysis:** While flow will be diverted to all open collaterals, including the rectal pathway, there is no physiological basis to assume a *preferential* diversion to this specific route. In fact, pathways anatomically adjacent to the ligated varices, such as the gastric fundus, are at very high risk. The statement that \"esophageal varices do not recur\" is, again, a critical and definitive error.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5146364"}]}
