It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid dynamics as applied to physiological systems, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objective in its phrasing. The model of blood flow, while a simplification, is a standard and appropriate first-order approximation for the context described.\n\nThe problem requires the determination of the multiplicative change in volumetric blood flow through a cylindrical artery following a specified increase in its radius. The flow is described as steady, laminar, and involving a Newtonian fluid. These conditions are precisely those under which the Hagen-Poiseuille equation is applicable.\n\nThe Hagen-Poiseuille equation gives the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, through a rigid cylindrical pipe of length $L$ and internal radius $R$ as:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi R^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\nwhere $\\Delta P$ is the pressure drop across the pipe and $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nLet the initial state of the artery be denoted by subscript $1$ and the final state after the pharmacologic intervention by subscript $2$.\nThe initial volumetric flow rate is:\n$$Q_1 = \\frac{\\pi R_1^4 \\Delta P_1}{8 \\eta_1 L_1}$$\nThe final volumetric flow rate is:\n$$Q_2 = \\frac{\\pi R_2^4 \\Delta P_2}{8 \\eta_2 L_2}$$\n\nThe problem states that the pressure drop ($\\Delta P$), dynamic viscosity ($\\eta$), and vessel length ($L$) remain constant. Therefore, we have:\n$\\Delta P_1 = \\Delta P_2 = \\Delta P$\n$\\eta_1 = \\eta_2 = \\eta$\n$L_1 = L_2 = L$\n\nThe intervention causes a uniform increase in the vessel's internal radius by 20%. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$R_2 = R_1 + 0.20 R_1 = (1 + 0.20) R_1 = 1.2 R_1$$\nFor exact calculation, we can express $1.2$ as a rational fraction:\n$$R_2 = \\frac{6}{5} R_1$$\n\nWe seek the multiplicative change, or fold-change, in volumetric blood flow, which is the ratio $\\frac{Q_2}{Q_1}$.\n$$\\frac{Q_2}{Q_1} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi R_2^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}}{\\frac{\\pi R_1^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}}$$\nThe constant terms $\\pi$, $\\Delta P$, $8$, $\\eta$, and $L$ cancel out, leaving a simplified relationship that depends only on the radii:\n$$\\frac{Q_2}{Q_1} = \\frac{R_2^4}{R_1^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_2}{R_1}\\right)^4$$\n\nSubstituting the relationship between $R_2$ and $R_1$:\n$$\\frac{Q_2}{Q_1} = \\left(\\frac{\\frac{6}{5} R_1}{R_1}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{6}{5}\\right)^4$$\n\nCalculating the final value:\n$$\\frac{Q_2}{Q_1} = \\frac{6^4}{5^4} = \\frac{1296}{625}$$\nIn decimal form, this is exactly $2.0736$. Thus, a 20% increase in the radius of the artery results in a 107.36% increase in blood flow, more than doubling the volumetric rate.\n\nBrief clinical interpretation:\nThe result highlights the profound impact of small changes in vessel diameter on blood flow, a consequence of the fourth-power relationship in the Hagen-Poiseuille law. In the context of the hip, the femoral head's blood supply is notoriously tenuous, relying principally on the retinacular arteries. This calculation demonstrates that a minor vasodilation (a 20% increase in radius) can more than double perfusion, which could be critical in preventing or treating ischemia. Conversely, it illustrates a severe vulnerability: a small vasospasm (narrowing) would cause a disproportionately large and potentially catastrophic reduction in blood flow, increasing the risk of avascular necrosis.\n\nThis situation contrasts sharply with the blood supply to the scapular region. The scapula is nourished by a rich collateral network involving the dorsal scapular, suprascapular, and circumflex scapular arteries, which form the scapular anastomosis. This network provides multiple, redundant pathways for blood flow. If one artery is compromised, the others can compensate, maintaining adequate perfusion. This redundancy makes the scapular circulation far more resilient to the occlusion or stenosis of a single vessel. The clinical significance of a change in a single artery's radius is therefore greatly diminished in the scapular region compared to the high-stakes, \"end-artery\" nature of the femoral head's supply.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1296}{625}}$$", "id": "5098759"}, {"introduction": "Collateral circulation inherently involves multiple pathways for blood.

Direct antegrade flow into the axillary artery is therefore severely reduced, and perfusion of the distal axillary segment must rely on scapular collateral channels.

Both channels converge into the circumflex scapular artery and then into the subscapular and axillary arteries distal to the stenosis.\n\nModel each arterial segment as a rigid cylindrical tube carrying steady, laminar flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid dynamics, specifically hemodynamics. It is well-posed, objective, self-contained, and describes a physically plausible scenario. The problem can be formalized and solved using standard mathematical and physical models.\n\nThe problem asks for the fraction of total collateral blood flow that passes through the suprascapular artery in a simplified model of the scapular anastomosis. The model treats arterial segments as rigid cylindrical tubes with steady, laminar flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid. The core principle governing this system is the Hagen-Poiseuille law, which relates the pressure drop, $\\Delta P$, across a segment to its volumetric flow rate, $Q$, and its hydraulic resistance, $R$:\n$$\n\\Delta P = Q R\n$$\nFor a cylindrical tube of length $L$ and internal radius $r$, the hydraulic resistance $R$ is given by:\n$$\nR = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4}\n$$\nwhere $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nThe anatomical description indicates that the suprascapular artery and the dorsal scapular artery form a parallel network. They originate from a common pressure source (proximal subclavian inflow) and terminate at a common pressure sink (the circumflex scapular anastomotic node). For any two or more conduits arranged in parallel, the pressure drop across each conduit is identical.\n\nLet the subscripts $s$ and $d$ denote the suprascapular and dorsal scapular arteries, respectively. We can write the flow rates and resistances for each branch as $Q_s, R_s$ and $Q_d, R_d$. Since they are in parallel, the pressure drop across them is the same:\n$$\n\\Delta P_s = \\Delta P_d\n$$\nUsing the Hagen-Poiseuille relation, we get:\n$$\nQ_s R_s = Q_d R_d\n$$\nThe total collateral flow, $Q_{total}$, entering the anastomotic node is the sum of the flows from the two branches:\n$$\nQ_{total} = Q_s + Q_d\n$$\nThe objective is to find the fraction of the total flow that comes from the suprascapular artery, which is the ratio $\\frac{Q_s}{Q_{total}}$.\n\nFrom the equal pressure drop equation, we can express $Q_d$ in terms of $Q_s$:\n$$\nQ_d = Q_s \\frac{R_s}{R_d}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for total flow:\n$$\nQ_{total} = Q_s + Q_s \\frac{R_s}{R_d} = Q_s \\left(1 + \\frac{R_s}{R_d}\\right) = Q_s \\left(\\frac{R_d + R_s}{R_d}\\right)\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives the desired fraction:\n$$\n\\frac{Q_s}{Q_{total}} = \\frac{R_d}{R_s + R_d}\n$$\nThis relationship is analogous to the current divider rule in electrical circuits. Note that the properties of the shared anastomotic segment ($L_c$, $r_c$) are not required to determine the distribution of flow between the parallel branches, as this ratio depends only on the relative resistances of the parallel paths themselves.\n\nNow, we substitute the formula for hydraulic resistance into the flow fraction equation:\n$$\n\\frac{Q_s}{Q_{total}} = \\frac{\\frac{8 \\eta L_d}{\\pi r_d^4}}{\\frac{8 \\eta L_s}{\\pi r_s^4} + \\frac{8 \\eta L_d}{\\pi r_d^4}}\n$$\nThe constant term $\\frac{8 \\eta}{\\pi}$ is common to all terms and can be canceled out:\n$$\n\\frac{Q_s}{Q_{total}} = \\frac{\\frac{L_d}{r_d^4}}{\\frac{L_s}{r_s^4} + \\frac{L_d}{r_d^4}}\n$$\nThe problem provides the following geometric data:\n- Suprascapular branch: $L_{s} = 6$ cm, $r_{s} = 1.2$ mm\n- Dorsal scapular branch: $L_{d} = 9$ cm, $r_{d} = 1.0$ mm\n\nFor the calculation to be dimensionally consistent, the units for length and radius must be harmonized. We convert all lengths to millimeters (mm):\n- $L_s = 6$ cm $= 60$ mm\n- $r_s = 1.2$ mm\n- $L_d = 9$ cm $= 90$ mm\n- $r_d = 1.0$ mm\n\nWe can now compute the relative resistance terms $\\frac{L}{r^4}$:\n- For the suprascapular artery: $\\frac{L_s}{r_s^4} = \\frac{60}{(1.2)^4} = \\frac{60}{2.0736}$\n- For the dorsal scapular artery: $\\frac{L_d}{r_d^4} = \\frac{90}{(1.0)^4} = \\frac{90}{1} = 90$\n\nThe numerical value for the suprascapular term is $\\frac{60}{2.0736} \\approx 28.935185$. The units are mm$^{-3}$, but they will cancel in the final ratio.\n\nSubstitute these values into the flow fraction formula:\n$$\n\\frac{Q_s}{Q_{total}} = \\frac{90}{\\frac{60}{2.0736} + 90} = \\frac{90}{28.935185... + 90} = \\frac{90}{118.935185...}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\n\\frac{Q_s}{Q_{total}} \\approx 0.756708...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure is $0$, so we round down.\n$$\n\\frac{Q_s}{Q_{total}} \\approx 0.7567\n$$\nThus, approximately $75.67\\%$ of the total collateral flow arrives via the suprascapular artery. This is counterintuitive, as the suprascapular artery is shorter but the dorsal scapular artery's resistance is much higher due to its smaller radius (resistance is proportional to $r^{-4}$). Let me re-check the calculation.\n\nAh, I made an error in the final step. I calculated the fraction for the dorsal scapular artery, not the suprascapular artery. Let me correct the formula derivation.\n\nThe goal is to find $\\frac{Q_s}{Q_{total}}$.\nMy derived formula was $\\frac{Q_s}{Q_{total}} = \\frac{R_d}{R_s + R_d}$. This is correct.\nThe resistance of the dorsal scapular artery is $R_d \\propto \\frac{L_d}{r_d^4} = 90$.\nThe resistance of the suprascapular artery is $R_s \\propto \\frac{L_s}{r_s^4} \\approx 28.935$.\nSo the formula is $\\frac{Q_s}{Q_{total}} = \\frac{R_d}{R_s + R_d} = \\frac{90}{28.935... + 90} = \\frac{90}{118.935...} \\approx 0.7567$.\n\nWait, checking the current divider rule again.\nTotal current $I_{total} = I_1 + I_2$. Voltage drop is $V = I_1 R_1 = I_2 R_2$.\nFraction of current through $R_1$ is $\\frac{I_1}{I_{total}}$.\n$I_2 = I_1 \\frac{R_1}{R_2}$.\n$I_{total} = I_1 + I_1 \\frac{R_1}{R_2} = I_1 \\left(1 + \\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right) = I_1 \\left(\\frac{R_2 + R_1}{R_2}\\right)$.\nSo $\\frac{I_1}{I_{total}} = \\frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$.\nThis is correct. The flow fraction through a given branch is proportional to the resistance of the *other* branch.\n\nSo, the fraction of flow through the suprascapular artery ($s$) is proportional to the resistance of the dorsal scapular artery ($d$).\nMy calculation is:\n$\\frac{Q_s}{Q_{total}} = \\frac{R_d}{R_s + R_d}$.\n$R_s \\propto \\frac{L_s}{r_s^4} \\approx 28.935$.\n$R_d \\propto \\frac{L_d}{r_d^4} = 90$.\nThe dorsal scapular artery ($d$) is the higher resistance path.\nThe suprascapular artery ($s$) is the lower resistance path.\nTherefore, more flow should go through the suprascapular artery.\nThe fraction of flow through the suprascapular path ($s$) is $\\frac{R_d}{R_s + R_d}$, which is $\\frac{90}{28.935+90}$. This value is greater than $0.5$, which is consistent with more flow going through the lower resistance path.\n\nThe calculation stands. It seemed counterintuitive that the fraction was so high, but the fourth-power dependence on radius is extremely strong. Even though the dorsal scapular artery is only slightly smaller in radius ($1.0$ mm vs $1.2$ mm), its resistance per unit length is $(1.2/1.0)^4 = 1.2^4 = 2.0736$ times greater. A $20\\%$ larger radius leads to more than double the flow for a given pressure drop and length.\n\nFinal calculation again for precision:\n$$\n\\frac{Q_s}{Q_{total}} = \\frac{90}{\\frac{60}{2.0736} + 90} = \\frac{90 \\times 2.0736}{60 + (90 \\times 2.0736)} = \\frac{186.624}{60 + 186.624} = \\frac{186.624}{246.624}\n$$\n$186.624 / 246.624 \\approx 0.756708...$\n\nThe result is indeed correct.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\n**Part 1: Series vs. Parallel Resistance**\n\nWe start from the definition of hydrodynamic resistance, $R \\equiv \\frac{\\Delta P}{Q}$, and the principle of conservation of mass for an incompressible fluid.\n\nFor two arterial segments with resistances $R_1$ and $R_2$ arranged in **series**, they form a single, end-to-end pathway. By conservation of mass, the volumetric flow rate $Q$ must be the same through both segments: $Q_{total} = Q_1 = Q_2$. The total pressure drop $\\Delta P_{total}$ across the series combination is the sum of the individual pressure drops: $\\Delta P_{total} = \\Delta P_1 + \\Delta P_2$. Substituting the definition of resistance, we have:\n$$R_{series} Q_{total} = R_1 Q_1 + R_2 Q_2$$\nSince $Q_{total} = Q_1 = Q_2$, we can divide by the flow rate, yielding the total resistance for a series arrangement:\n$$R_{series} = R_1 + R_2$$\nIn a series arrangement, the total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances, meaning each added segment increases the total resistance to flow.\n\nFor two segments with resistances $R_1$ and $R_2$ arranged in **parallel**, they provide alternative pathways between a common upstream node and a common downstream node. Thus, the pressure drop $\\Delta P$ across each segment is the same: $\\Delta P_{total} = \\Delta P_1 = \\Delta P_2$. At the upstream junction, the total flow $Q_{total}$ splits between the branches, so by conservation of mass: $Q_{total} = Q_1 + Q_2$. Substituting the definition of resistance ($Q = \\Delta P / R$) into this expression gives:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta P_{total}}{R_{parallel}} = \\frac{\\Delta P_1}{R_1} + \\frac{\\Delta P_2}{R_2}$$\nSince $\\Delta P_{total} = \\Delta P_1 = \\Delta P_2$, we can divide by the pressure drop, yielding the rule for parallel resistances:\n$$\\frac{1}{R_{parallel}} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2}$$\nIn a parallel arrangement, the reciprocal of the total resistance is the sum of the reciprocals of individual resistances. This means that adding a new parallel pathway always decreases the total effective resistance.\n\nThe problem states that collateral channels \"interconnect a common upstream node to a common downstream node.\" This is the definition of a parallel arrangement. Therefore, both the scapular and hip anastomotic networks functionally present as parallel arrangements, which serve to decrease the overall resistance to flow and thereby maintain perfusion distal to an upstream occlusion.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of Single-Vessel Resistance**\n\nWe are given the assumptions of steady, incompressible, laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid in a rigid, cylindrical vessel. These are the conditions under which the Hagen-Poiseuille equation applies. The equation gives the volumetric flow rate $Q$ as:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4}{8 \\eta L} \\Delta P$$\nwhere $r$ is the vessel radius, $L$ is its length, $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, and $\\Delta P$ is the pressure drop along the length $L$.\nThe problem requires us to find the hydrodynamic resistance $R$, defined as $R \\equiv \\frac{\\Delta P}{Q}$. We can rearrange the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to solve for this ratio:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta P}{Q} = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4}$$\nThus, the hydrodynamic resistance of a single cylindrical vessel is:\n$$R = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4}$$\nThis result shows that resistance is highly sensitive to the vessel radius, scaling with $r^{-4}$.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of Effective Resistance**\n\nThe simplified scapular plexus is modeled as two channels, $A$ and $B$, in parallel. The effective resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is found using the formula for parallel resistors:\n$$\\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{1}{R_A} + \\frac{1}{R_B}$$\nFirst, we calculate the individual resistances $R_A$ and $R_B$ using the derived formula and the given parameters.\n\nThe parameters are:\n$\\eta = 3.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}$\n$r_{A} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$L_{A} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$r_{B} = 1.6 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$L_{B} = 0.16\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nCalculating resistance for Branch $A$:\n$$R_A = \\frac{8 \\eta L_A}{\\pi r_A^4} = \\frac{8 (3.5 \\times 10^{-3}) (0.10)}{\\pi (1.2 \\times 10^{-3})^4}$$\n$$R_A = \\frac{2.8 \\times 10^{-3}}{\\pi (2.0736 \\times 10^{-12})} \\approx 4.2983 \\times 10^8 \\, \\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s\\cdot m^{-3}}$$\n\nCalculating resistance for Branch $B$:\n$$R_B = \\frac{8 \\eta L_B}{\\pi r_B^4} = \\frac{8 (3.5 \\times 10^{-3}) (0.16)}{\\pi (1.6 \\times 10^{-3})^4}$$\n$$R_B = \\frac{4.48 \\times 10^{-3}}{\\pi (6.5536 \\times 10^{-12})} \\approx 2.1743 \\times 10^8 \\, \\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s\\cdot m^{-3}}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the effective resistance $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ of the parallel combination. Instead of inverting the large numbers, it is more precise to compute the sum of the reciprocals first.\n$$\\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{1}{R_A} + \\frac{1}{R_B} = \\frac{\\pi r_A^4}{8 \\eta L_A} + \\frac{\\pi r_B^4}{8 \\eta L_B} = \\frac{\\pi}{8 \\eta} \\left( \\frac{r_A^4}{L_A} + \\frac{r_B^4}{L_B} \\right)$$\nLet's compute the terms in the parenthesis:\n$$\\frac{r_A^4}{L_A} = \\frac{(1.2 \\times 10^{-3})^4}{0.10} = \\frac{2.0736 \\times 10^{-12}}{0.10} = 2.0736 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{m^3}$$\n$$\\frac{r_B^4}{L_B} = \\frac{(1.6 \\times 10^{-3})^4}{0.16} = \\frac{6.5536 \\times 10^{-12}}{0.16} = 4.096 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{m^3}$$\nThe sum is:\n$$\\frac{r_A^4}{L_A} + \\frac{r_B^4}{L_B} = (2.0736 + 4.096) \\times 10^{-11} = 6.1696 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{m^3}$$\nNow we find $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{8 \\eta} \\left( 6.1696 \\times 10^{-11} \\right) \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{8 \\eta}{\\pi (6.1696 \\times 10^{-11})}$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{8 (3.5 \\times 10^{-3})}{\\pi (6.1696 \\times 10^{-11})} = \\frac{2.8 \\times 10^{-2}}{1.9382 \\times 10^{-10}} \\approx 1.4446 \\times 10^8 \\, \\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s\\cdot m^{-3}}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives $1.44 \\times 10^8$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.44 \\times 10^{8}}$$", "id": "5098765"}]}
