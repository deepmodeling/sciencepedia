The physiological premise—the transition from parallel fetal circulation (placenta and body) to series neonatal circulation (body only)—is a fundamental concept in developmental anatomy and physiology. The given resistance values are within a plausible physiological range. The problem contains a measured value, $R_{\\text{eff,fetal}}$, which differs from the theoretical parallel resistance calculated from the given components ($R_{\\text{eq,fetal}} = (1/R_p + 1/R_b)^{-1} = (1/0.5 + 1/1.4)^{-1} = (2 + 10/14)^{-1} = (19/7)^{-1} = 7/19 \\approx 0.368\\,\\text{mmHg·min/L}$).

The measured value is extraneous to the specific tasks, which are to derive a general formula and identify a parameter for the postnatal state. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to arrive at a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Equivalent Resistance in the Fetal State**\nThe problem is based on the hydrodynamic analog of Ohm's law, $\\Delta P = Q R$, where $\\Delta P$ is the pressure difference across the circuit, $Q$ is the volumetric flow rate, and $R$ is the hydrodynamic resistance.\n\nIn the fetal state, the placental vasculature and the systemic body vasculature are arranged in parallel. Let the total blood flow entering this parallel segment be $Q_{\\text{total}}$. This flow splits into the placental flow, $Q_p$, and the body flow, $Q_b$. According to the principle of conservation of mass for an incompressible fluid, the total flow is the sum of the flows through the individual branches:\n$$Q_{\\text{total}} = Q_p + Q_b$$\n\nFor components in a parallel arrangement, the pressure drop, $\\Delta P$, across each branch is identical. Applying the hydrodynamic law to each branch gives:\n$$Q_p = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_p}$$\n$$Q_b = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_b}$$\n\nThe equivalent resistance of the entire parallel system, which we denote as $R_{\\text{eq,fetal}}$, is defined by the relationship between the total flow and the common pressure drop:\n$$Q_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_{\\text{eq,fetal}}}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $Q_{\\text{total}}$, $Q_p$, and $Q_b$ into the flow summation equation, we have:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta P}{R_{\\text{eq,fetal}}} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_p} + \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_b}$$\n\nAssuming a non-zero pressure drop ($\\Delta P \\neq 0$), we can divide the entire equation by $\\Delta P$ to obtain the general expression for the reciprocal of the equivalent resistance:\n$$\\frac{1}{R_{\\text{eq,fetal}}} = \\frac{1}{R_p} + \\frac{1}{R_b}$$\nThis completes the derivation for the equivalent resistance of the parallel fetal circulation segment. This can also be written as $R_{\\text{eq,fetal}} = \\frac{R_p R_b}{R_p + R_b}$.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Postnatal Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR)**\nThe problem states that immediately after birth, the placental circulation is eliminated. This physiological event is equivalent to removing the parallel branch corresponding to the placental resistance, $R_p$, from the circuit.\n\nWith the placental pathway removed, the only remaining component in the described circulatory segment is the systemic body vasculature. Therefore, the total resistance of this segment in the postnatal state is simply the resistance of the body's vascular bed. The problem defines this as the Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR).\n\nThe value for the body's systemic resistance is given in the problem statement as $R_b$.\n$$R_b = 1.4\\,\\text{mmHg·min/L}$$\nTherefore, the postnatal SVR for this segment is equal to $R_b$.\n$$SVR_{\\text{postnatal}} = R_b = 1.4\\,\\text{mmHg·min/L}$$\nThe given values for the fetal placental resistance, $R_p = 0.5\\,\\text{mmHg·min/L}$, and the measured effective fetal resistance, $R_{\\text{eff,fetal}} = 0.7\\,\\text{mmHg·min/L}$, are relevant only to the prenatal state and are not required for determining the postnatal SVR.
