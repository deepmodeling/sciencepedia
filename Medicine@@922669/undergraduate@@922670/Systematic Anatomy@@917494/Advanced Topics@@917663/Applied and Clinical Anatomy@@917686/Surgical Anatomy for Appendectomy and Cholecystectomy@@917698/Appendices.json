A well-tested and widely accepted anatomical fact is that the normal net rotation of the midgut is $270^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise, which positions the cecum to ultimately descend into the Right Lower Quadrant (RLQ). In incomplete rotation, the cecum may remain subhepatic, affecting the surgical approach.\n\nA patient is observed to have a total midgut rotation of $180^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise. Using the fundamental base above and first principles of developmental rotation about the SMA, do the following:\n\n1. Compute the signed net deviation angle $\\Delta\\theta$ from normal, defined as $\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_{\\text{observed}} - \\theta_{\\text{normal}}$, where $\\theta_{\\text{observed}}$ is the actual rotation and $\\theta_{\\text{normal}}$ is the established normal rotation. Express $\\Delta\\theta$ in degrees.\n\n2. Predict the quadrant in which the cecum is most likely located based on this rotational deviation and the known sequence of cecal migration.

This sequence proceeds as follows: during physiological herniation, the first $90^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise rotation positions the prearterial segment (future small intestine) to the right and the postarterial segment (future colon) to the left. In this configuration, the cecal bud lies high and subhepatic. As the midgut returns to the abdominal cavity, an additional $180^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise rotation completes a total of $270^{\\circ}$, and subsequent cecal descent places the cecum into the Right Lower Quadrant (RLQ).\n\nWe are given $\\theta_{\\text{observed}} = 180^{\\circ}$ and the normal $\\theta_{\\text{normal}} = 270^{\\circ}$. The signed deviation is defined by\n$$\n\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_{\\text{observed}} - \\theta_{\\text{normal}}.\n$$\nSubstituting,\n$$\n\\Delta\\theta = 180^{\\circ} - 270^{\\circ} = -90^{\\circ}.\n$$\nThe negative value indicates a shortfall of $90^{\\circ}$ relative to normal counterclockwise rotation, that is, incomplete rotation. From the fundamental developmental sequence, after the initial $90^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise rotation, the cecal bud is positioned subhepatically. Failure to achieve the full additional $180^{\\circ}$ rotation and descent can leave the cecum in a subhepatic location. Therefore, with a $90^{\\circ}$ shortfall (total $180^{\\circ}$), the cecum is most likely retained in the subhepatic position, corresponding to the Right Upper Quadrant (RUQ).\n\nUsing the required encoding, RUQ corresponds to the code $1$.\n\nThus, the final ordered pair is $\\Delta\\theta = -90$ (degrees) and quadrant code $1$.\n\nNo rounding is required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}-90 & 1\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5156033"}, {"introduction": "Beyond knowing that anatomical variations exist, a surgeon must also consider the likelihood of encountering them.

A linear function can be expressed in the form $y = m x + b$. In this context, the diameter $D(A)$ is the dependent variable, and the age $A$ is the independent variable.\n\nThe baseline condition is given: at age $A=50$, the diameter is $D(50) = 6$ mm.\nThe rate of increase is given as $1$ millimeter per decade. A decade is equivalent to $10$ years. Therefore, the slope of the linear function, which represents the rate of change of diameter with respect to age, is:\n$$m = \\frac{\\Delta D}{\\Delta A} = \\frac{1 \\text{ mm}}{10 \\text{ years}} = 0.1 \\frac{\\text{mm}}{\\text{year}}$$\nWe can model the diameter $D(A)$ for any age $A \\ge 50$ using the point-slope form of a linear equation, with the point being $(A_0, D_0) = (50, 6)$.\n$$D(A) - D_0 = m(A - A_0)$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$D(A) - 6 = 0.1 \\times (A - 50)$$\nThis can be rearranged to give the explicit function for $D(A)$:\n$$D(A) = 6 + 0.1 \\times (A - 50)$$\nAn alternative, more direct interpretation of the problem statement is to calculate the number of decades past age $50$ and add the corresponding increase to the baseline diameter.\nThe number of decades past age $50$ for a patient of age $A$ is given by $\\frac{A - 50}{10}$.\nThe total increase in diameter is the rate of increase ($1$ mm/decade) multiplied by the number of decades:\n$$\\text{Increase} = 1 \\frac{\\text{mm}}{\\text{decade}} \\times \\left( \\frac{A - 50}{10} \\right) \\text{decades}$$\nThe expected diameter $D(A)$ is the sum of the baseline diameter at age $50$ and this increase:\n$$D(A) = D(50) + 1 \\times \\frac{A - 50}{10}$$\n$$D(A) = 6 + \\frac{A - 50}{10}$$\nThis is equivalent to the first formulation.\n\nNow, we must compute the expected diameter for the patient aged $70$ years. We substitute $A = 70$ into the derived formula:\n$$D(70) = 6 + \\frac{70 - 50}{10}$$\nFirst, calculate the difference in age:\n$$70 - 50 = 20$$\nSubstitute this back into the equation:\n$$D(70) = 6 + \\frac{20}{10}$$\nThe number of decades past $50$ is:\n$$\\frac{20}{10} = 2$$\nSo, the increase in diameter is $2$ decades $\\times 1$ mm/decade, which is $2$ mm.\nFinally, add this increase to the baseline diameter:\n$$D(70) = 6 + 2 = 8$$\nThe expected common bile duct diameter for a $70$-year-old patient, according to the given rule, is $8$ millimeters.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "5156109"}]}
