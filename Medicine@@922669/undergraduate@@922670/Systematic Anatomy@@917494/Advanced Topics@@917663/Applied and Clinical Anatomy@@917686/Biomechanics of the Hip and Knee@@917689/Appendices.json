The problem is approached by applying the principles of static equilibrium to a simplified model of the human pelvis.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\nAll given information is extracted verbatim:\n- The system is a subject in a steady single-leg stance on the right lower limb.\n- The pelvis is modeled as a rigid body pivoting about the right hip joint center.\n- The subject's total mass is $m$.\n- The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.\n- The pelvis width, $w$, is the horizontal distance between the right and left hip joint centers.\n- The gravitational line of action of the body's weight passes vertically downward at a horizontal distance of $w/2$ from the right hip joint center.\n- The right hip abductor muscle group acts with a combined effective force $F$ and an effective abductor moment arm $r$ about the right hip joint center.\n- Torques from passive structures and other muscles are neglected.\n- The hip joint reaction force passes through the joint center.\n- There is no angular acceleration of the pelvis.\nThe problem requires deriving an expression for $F$ in terms of $m$, $g$, $w$, and $r$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in Newtonian mechanics (specifically, statics), well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objective in its language. The model is a standard simplification used in biomechanics and does not violate any physical laws or contain inconsistencies. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nTo solve the problem, we apply the condition for static rotational equilibrium. The problem states that the stance is \"steady\" and there is \"no angular acceleration,\" which implies that the net moment (or torque), $\\sum \\tau$, acting on the pelvis about any point must be zero.\n$$\n\\sum \\tau = 0\n$$\nWe choose the pivot point to be the center of the right hip joint, as specified in the problem. This is a convenient choice because the hip joint reaction force passes through this point, meaning its moment arm is zero, and thus it exerts no torque about this axis. This simplifies the analysis.\n\nTwo forces create moments about the right hip joint center:\n1.  The force due to the body's weight, which has a magnitude of $mg$. The problem states that its line of action is at a perpendicular horizontal distance of $w/2$ from the pivot. This force tends to cause the unsupported (left) side of the pelvis to drop, which corresponds to a clockwise (adduction) rotation about the right hip.\n2.  The force from the hip abductor muscles, $F$. The problem provides its effective moment arm as $r$. This force counteracts the weight by pulling the pelvis up on the supported side, creating a counter-clockwise (abduction) rotation.\n\nLet's adopt the standard convention where counter-clockwise (CCW) moments are positive and clockwise (CW) moments are negative.\n\nThe moment produced by the body's weight, $\\tau_g$, is a clockwise moment:\n$$\n\\tau_g = - (mg) \\left( \\frac{w}{2} \\right)\n$$\nThe moment produced by the abductor muscle force, $\\tau_F$, is a counter-clockwise moment:\n$$\n\\tau_F = F \\cdot r\n$$\nFor the pelvis to remain level (in rotational equilibrium), the sum of these moments must be zero:\n$$\n\\sum \\tau = \\tau_F + \\tau_g = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the moments into the equilibrium equation:\n$$\n(F \\cdot r) + \\left( - mg \\frac{w}{2} \\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\nF \\cdot r - \\frac{mgw}{2} = 0\n$$\nNow, we solve for the force $F$:\n$$\nF \\cdot r = \\frac{mgw}{2}\n$$\n$$\nF = \\frac{mgw}{2r}\n$$\nThis expression represents the magnitude of the abductor force required to exactly balance the moment created by the body's weight. Any force smaller than this value would result in a net clockwise torque, causing the pelvis to tilt. Therefore, this is the minimum force required to prevent pelvic tilt.

This exercise uses a combination of static force balance and a simple elastic model of the ACL (Hooke's Law) to quantify how hamstring muscle activation can \"shield\" the ligament from excessive strain. This practice provides a clear mechanical basis for understanding injury prevention and rehabilitation strategies involving muscle co-contraction.

Assume quasi-static conditions so that inertial effects are negligible, and take the anterior tibial direction as positive. At this knee angle, the Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) is slack and does not carry load, and all net anterior shear at the tibiofemoral joint is resisted by the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL). Model the ACL as a linear elastic structure that engages only under anterior tibial translation, with constant small-strain stiffness $k_A$.

Co-contraction of the hamstrings produces a posteriorly directed shear at the tibia of magnitude $F_h$.\n\nUsing Newton’s laws for static equilibrium in the anteroposterior direction and Hooke’s law for the ACL, derive from first principles how hamstring co-contraction changes ACL elongation and thus anterior tibial translation.

The final reported quantity is a single number representing $\\Delta x$ in millimeters.", "solution": "The solution proceeds from first principles, applying Newton's laws for static equilibrium and Hooke's law for the ACL. We analyze two states: the baseline state without hamstring co-contraction and the final state with hamstring co-contraction. The anterior direction is designated as positive.\n\n**State 1: Baseline Condition (No Hamstring Co-contraction)**\n\nIn the baseline state, the tibia is subjected to a net anterior shear force $F_A$. According to the problem statement, the ACL is the sole structure resisting this anterior shear. For the tibiofemoral joint to be in static equilibrium in the anteroposterior direction, the tensile force generated within the ACL, which pulls the tibia posteriorly, must balance the applied anterior shear force. Let $F_{\\text{ACL},1}$ be the tensile force in the ACL and $x_1$ be the corresponding anterior tibial translation (which is also the elongation of the ACL).\n\nApplying Newton's first law for static equilibrium in the anterior direction:\n$$ \\sum F_{\\text{anterior}} = F_A - F_{\\text{ACL},1} = 0 $$\nTherefore, the magnitude of the ACL force is:\n$$ F_{\\text{ACL},1} = F_A $$\nAccording to Hooke's law, the force in the ACL is related to its elongation by its stiffness, $k_A$:\n$$ F_{\\text{ACL},1} = k_A x_1 $$\nBy combining these two equations, we can solve for the initial anterior translation, $x_1$:\n$$ x_1 = \\frac{F_A}{k_A} $$\n\n**State 2: With Hamstring Co-contraction**\n\nNow, we consider the effect of hamstring co-contraction. The hamstrings produce a posteriorly directed shear force of magnitude $F_h$. Since the anterior direction is positive, this force contributes a component of $-F_h$ to the net force calculation. The total net shear force, $F_{\\text{net}}$, acting on the tibia is now the sum of the baseline anterior shear and the hamstring-induced posterior shear.\n$$ F_{\\text{net}} = F_A - F_h $$\nThis net force must be balanced by the new tensile force in the ACL, $F_{\\text{ACL},2}$, for the joint to remain in static equilibrium.\n$$ \\sum F_{\\text{anterior}} = F_{\\text{net}} - F_{\\text{ACL},2} = (F_A - F_h) - F_{\\text{ACL},2} = 0 $$\nTherefore, the new ACL force is:\n$$ F_{\\text{ACL},2} = F_A - F_h $$\nThis new ACL force corresponds to a new anterior tibial translation, $x_2$, according to Hooke's law:\n$$ F_{\\text{ACL},2} = k_A x_2 $$\nSolving for the new translation, $x_2$:\n$$ x_2 = \\frac{F_A - F_h}{k_A} $$\n\n**Justification of Hamstring Effect**\n\nThe hamstring co-contraction introduces a posterior shear force $F_h$. This force directly counteracts the baseline anterior shear force $F_A$. As shown in the derivation above, the net anterior shear that the ACL must resist is reduced from $F_A$ to $F_A - F_h$. This reduction in net anterior shear consequently reduces the tensile load on the ACL. Because the ACL is modeled as a spring, the reduced load leads to a smaller elongation, meaning a smaller anterior tibial translation. This mechanism is often referred to as \"ACL shielding\" or a \"protective\" co-contraction.\n\n**Calculation of the Change in Anterior Tibial Translation ($\\Delta x$)**\n\nThe change in anterior tibial translation, $\\Delta x$, is the final translation minus the initial translation:\n$$ \\Delta x = x_2 - x_1 $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $x_1$ and $x_2$:\n$$ \\Delta x = \\frac{F_A - F_h}{k_A} - \\frac{F_A}{k_A} $$\n$$ \\Delta x = \\frac{(F_A - F_h) - F_A}{k_A} $$\n$$ \\Delta x = -\\frac{F_h}{k_A} $$\nThis elegant result shows that the change in translation depends only on the hamstring force and the ACL stiffness, not on the baseline anterior shear. The negative sign indicates that the change is in the posterior direction, as expected for a protective muscle action.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $F_h = 120\\,\\mathrm{N}$ and $k_A = 240\\,\\mathrm{N/mm}$.\n$$ \\Delta x = -\\frac{120\\,\\mathrm{N}}{240\\,\\mathrm{N/mm}} $$\n$$ \\Delta x = -0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\nThe result is a change of $-0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, where the negative sign correctly signifies a posterior shift, which is a protective change for the ACL.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.5}$$", "id": "5086120"}]}
