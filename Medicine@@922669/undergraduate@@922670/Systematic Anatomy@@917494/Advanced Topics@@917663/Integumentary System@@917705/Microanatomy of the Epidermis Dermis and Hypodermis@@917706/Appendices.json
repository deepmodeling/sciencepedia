It constitutes only $\\approx 1.4\\%$ of the total thickness and has a moderate modulus. Its compliance contribution is negligible ($\\approx 0.12\\%$).\n- The dermis, rich in collagen, is the stiffest layer ($E_{\\mathrm{der}} = 1.20\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$). Although it makes up a substantial portion of the thickness ($\\approx 28.2\\%$), its high stiffness greatly limits its deformation, resulting in a very small contribution to the total compliance ($\\approx 1\\%$). It provides structural strength rather than compliance.\n- The hypodermis is primarily adipose tissue, which is known to be very soft. It is the thickest layer ($\\approx 70.4\\%$) and by far the most compliant (lowest $E$, $E_{\\mathrm{hyp}} = 0.030\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$). The combination of large thickness and extremely low elastic modulus makes its compliance term, $t_{\\mathrm{hyp}}/E_{\\mathrm{hyp}}$, overwhelmingly dominant. It accounts for almost $99\\%$ of the total compliance of the skin stack.\nIn conclusion, the overall through-thickness mechanical compliance is almost entirely governed by the properties of the hypodermis. The skin behaves mechanically like a very soft, thick foundation (hypodermis) protected by a relatively thin, stiff composite sheet (dermis and epidermis).\n\nThe final numerical answer for the total compliance is $134.82666...$, which rounds to $135$ to three significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{135}$$", "id": "5127394"}, {"introduction": "One of the epidermis's most critical functions is serving as a protective barrier against the environment.

The anatomical and physical parameters are within plausible ranges for a biophysical model. Proceeding with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the characteristic diffusion time's dependence on slab thickness and diffusion coefficient, starting from first principles.\n\nThe first principle is the conservation of mass for a solute in a one-dimensional system where concentration $C$ varies with position $x$ and time $t$. In the absence of sources or sinks (as stipulated by \"negligible binding, metabolism\"), the continuity equation in one dimension is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $J$ is the diffusive flux, representing the amount of substance passing through a unit area per unit time.\n\nThe second principle is the phenomenological definition of diffusive flux, given by Fick's first law. For a solute in a stationary medium (as per \"negligible ... convection\"), the flux is proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient:\n$$\nJ = -D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, a measure of the mobility of the solute within the medium.\n\nSubstituting Fick's first law into the continuity equation yields the general one-dimensional diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(-D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that the epidermis is treated as a \"homogeneous planar slab\" and the \"diffusion coefficient $D$ ... is identical at both sites\". This implies that $D$ is constant with respect to position $x$. Therefore, $D$ can be taken outside the spatial derivative, yielding Fick's second law for a homogeneous medium:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nTo determine the characteristic diffusion time, we perform a dimensional analysis of this equation. Let $L$ be the characteristic length scale of the system, which in this case is the thickness of the epidermal slab. Let $\\tau$ be the characteristic time scale, which is the quantity we seek to understand. The terms in the partial differential equation have the following dimensions, where $[C]$, $[t]$, and $[x]$ represent the dimensions of concentration, time, and length, respectively:\n$$\n\\frac{[C]}{[t]} \\sim D \\frac{[C]}{[x]^2}\n$$\nReplacing the dimensions with their characteristic scales, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{C_{char}}{\\tau} \\sim D \\frac{C_{char}}{L^2}\n$$\nwhere $C_{char}$ is some characteristic concentration scale, which cancels from both sides. Solving for the characteristic time $\\tau$ yields the fundamental relationship:\n$$\n\\tau \\sim \\frac{L^2}{D}\n$$\nThis relationship shows that the characteristic diffusion time across a slab is proportional to the square of the slab's thickness and inversely proportional to the diffusion coefficient. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nThe second part of the problem is to compute the ratio of the characteristic diffusion time for the plantar epidermis ($\\tau_{plantar}$) to that of the forearm epidermis ($\\tau_{forearm}$).
