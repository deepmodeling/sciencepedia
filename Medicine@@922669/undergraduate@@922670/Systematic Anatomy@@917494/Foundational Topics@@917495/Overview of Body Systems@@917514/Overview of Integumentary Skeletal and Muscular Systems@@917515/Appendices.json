A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Second Moment of Area, $I$**\n\nThe second moment of area, $I$, for a cross-section with respect to a centroidal axis (let's say the x-axis) is defined as $I = \\int_A y^2 \\, dA$. The cross-section is a hollow circle (an annulus) with outer radius $R$ and inner radius $r$. The thickness is $t = R-r$, so the inner radius is $r = R-t$.\n\nTo compute the integral, it is convenient to use polar coordinates $(\\rho, \\theta)$, where the y-coordinate is given by $y = \\rho \\sin\\theta$ and the differential area element is $dA = \\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$. The integration domain for the annulus is $\\rho \\in [r, R]$ and $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\n\nSubstituting these into the definition of $I$:\n$$I = \\int_A y^2 \\, dA = \\int_r^R \\int_0^{2\\pi} (\\rho \\sin\\theta)^2 (\\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta)$$\nWe can separate the integrals with respect to $\\rho$ and $\\theta$:\n$$I = \\int_r^R \\rho^3 \\, d\\rho \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin^2\\theta \\, d\\theta$$\n\nFirst, we evaluate the integral with respect to $\\rho$:\n$$\\int_r^R \\rho^3 \\, d\\rho = \\left[ \\frac{\\rho^4}{4} \\right]_r^R = \\frac{R^4 - r^4}{4}$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the integral with respect to $\\theta$, using the identity $\\sin^2\\theta = \\frac{1 - \\cos(2\\theta)}{2}$:\n$$\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin^2\\theta \\, d\\theta = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{1 - \\cos(2\\theta)}{2} \\, d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\theta - \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2\\theta) \\right]_0^{2\\pi}$$\n$$\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin^2\\theta \\, d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( (2\\pi - \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(4\\pi)) - (0 - \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(0)) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} (2\\pi - 0) = \\pi$$\n\nMultiplying the results of the two integrals gives the expression for $I$:\n$$I = \\left( \\frac{R^4 - r^4}{4} \\right) \\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{4}(R^4 - r^4)$$\nTo express this in terms of $R$ and $t$, we substitute $r = R-t$:\n$$I = \\frac{\\pi}{4}(R^4 - (R-t)^4)$$\nExpanding $(R-t)^4 = R^4 - 4R^3t + 6R^2t^2 - 4Rt^3 + t^4$, we get:\n$$I = \\frac{\\pi}{4}(R^4 - (R^4 - 4R^3t + 6R^2t^2 - 4Rt^3 + t^4))$$\n$$I = \\frac{\\pi}{4}(4R^3t - 6R^2t^2 + 4Rt^3 - t^4)$$\nThis is the derived expression for $I$ in terms of $R$ and $t$.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation of $I$**\n\nWe are given $R = 13\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and $t = 4\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of static equilibrium and biomechanics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objective in its language. The requested tasks are a standard application of these principles.\n\nThe fundamental definition of torque, $\\vec{\\tau}$, the rotational effect of a force, $\\vec{F}$, about an axis of rotation is given by the cross product of the position vector, $\\vec{p}$, from the axis to the point of force application, and the force vector itself:\n$$\n\\vec{\\tau} = \\vec{p} \\times \\vec{F}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the torque, $\\tau$, is given by:\n$$\n\\tau = |\\vec{p}| |\\vec{F}| \\sin(\\theta)\n$$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle between the vectors $\\vec{p}$ and $\\vec{F}$.\n\nThe problem introduces the concept of the moment arm, $r$, as the perpendicular distance from the joint's flexion axis to the force's line-of-action. This geometric quantity is defined as $r = |\\vec{p}| \\sin(\\theta)$. Substituting this definition into the torque magnitude equation provides the direct relationship linking torque, force, and moment arm:\n$$\n\\tau = (|\\vec{p}| \\sin(\\theta)) |\\vec{F}| = r F\n$$\nwhere $F = |\\vec{F}|$ is the magnitude of the muscle force.

This shows that the required muscle force $F$ is inversely proportional to the moment arm $r$ for a constant external torque $\\tau$.\n- An individual with a tendon insertion located more distally on the radius (a larger moment arm, $r$) would possess a greater mechanical advantage. They would need to generate less muscle force to produce the same $30 \\ \\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$ of elbow torque.\n- Conversely, an individual with a more proximal tendon insertion (a smaller moment arm, $r$) would be at a mechanical disadvantage, requiring greater muscle force to generate the same torque.\n\nSecond, concerning muscle excursion and contraction velocity, we must relate the linear motion of the muscle to the angular motion of the joint. The change in muscle-tendon unit length, or excursion ($\\Delta L$), required to produce a given joint angular displacement ($\\Delta\\theta$, in radians) is approximated by the arc length formula:\n$$\n\\Delta L \\approx r \\Delta\\theta\n$$\nThis relationship shows that the required muscle excursion is directly proportional to the moment arm $r$.\n- An individual with a larger moment arm $r$ must undergo a greater muscle excursion to produce the same angular displacement of the forearm.\n- An individual with a smaller moment arm $r$ will achieve the same joint rotation with less muscle shortening.\n\nSimilarly, we can relate the muscle's contraction velocity, $v_{muscle} = \\frac{dL}{dt}$, to the joint's angular velocity, $\\omega = \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}$, by differentiating the excursion relationship with respect to time:\n$$\nv_{muscle} = \\frac{d}{dt}(r\\theta) = r \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = r \\omega\n$$\nThis relationship shows that the required muscle contraction velocity is also directly proportional to the moment arm $r$.\n- An individual with a larger moment arm $r$ must contract their muscle at a higher velocity to produce the same joint angular velocity.\n- An individual with a smaller moment arm $r$ can produce the same joint angular velocity with a lower muscle contraction velocity.\n\nIn summary, there is a fundamental trade-off in musculoskeletal mechanics governed by the moment arm length. A larger moment arm ($r$) is optimized for force production (a \"force advantage\"), as less muscle force is needed to generate a given joint torque. However, this comes at the cost of a \"velocity disadvantage,\" as the muscle must shorten more and at a higher velocity to achieve a given joint rotation and angular velocity. Conversely, a smaller moment arm provides a \"velocity advantage,\" enabling rapid joint movements for a given muscle contraction velocity, but at the cost of a \"force disadvantage,\" requiring greater muscle force for a given torque. This trade-off illustrates how anatomical variations can predispose individuals toward proficiency in either high-force or high-speed tasks.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{7.50 \\times 10^{2}}\n$$", "id": "5139792"}]}
