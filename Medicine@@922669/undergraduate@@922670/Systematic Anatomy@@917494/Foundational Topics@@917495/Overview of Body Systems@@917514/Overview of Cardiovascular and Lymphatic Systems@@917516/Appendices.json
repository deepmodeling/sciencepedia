It utilizes a standard, albeit simplified, fluid dynamics model (Poiseuille-Hagen flow) to analyze a biofluid mechanics problem. This is a classic and valid approach in biophysics and biomedical engineering. The assumptions required, such as treating blood as a Newtonian fluid and the artery as a rigid tube, are common idealizations for establishing a first-order approximation, and the problem explicitly requests that they be stated. The data provided are self-consistent and sufficient to determine a unique solution. The problem does not violate any fundamental scientific principles, is mathematically formalizable, and contains no ambiguities or contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be formulated based on the provided information and governing physical laws.\n\nThe solution proceeds by applying the principles of steady, laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid through a rigid cylindrical tube. The relationship between volumetric flow rate $Q$, pressure drop $\\Delta P$, and hydraulic resistance $R$ is analogous to Ohm's law in electrical circuits:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R}$$\nThis fundamental definition states that flow is driven by a pressure difference and impeded by resistance.\n\nThe problem requires the use of the \"well-tested relation between laminar flow and vessel geometry,\" which is the Poiseuille-Hagen equation. This equation provides an expression for the hydraulic resistance $R$ of a cylindrical tube of length $L$ and radius $r$ to a Newtonian fluid of viscosity $\\eta$ under laminar flow conditions:\n$$R = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4}$$\nSubstituting this expression for resistance into the flow equation yields the full Poiseuille-Hagen law for volumetric flow rate:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\nThis derivation rests upon several key physical assumptions:\n1.  **Newtonian Fluid:** The fluid has a constant dynamic viscosity, $\\eta$, that is independent of the shear rate. Blood is, in fact, a non-Newtonian, shear-thinning fluid, but this assumption is a common and necessary simplification for this model.\n2.  **Laminar Flow:** The flow is smooth and orderly, occurring in parallel layers (laminae) with no disruption or mixing between them. Flow in arteries can become turbulent, particularly in or downstream of a stenosis, but the problem specifies laminar conditions.\n3.  **Rigid, Cylindrical Tube:** The vessel is modeled as a perfect cylinder with a constant radius and non-distensible (rigid) walls. Real arteries are tapered, branched, and elastic (compliant).\n4.  **Steady Flow:** The flow rate $Q$ and pressure drop $\\Delta P$ are constant over time. Arterial blood flow is pulsatile due to the cardiac cycle.\n5.  **No-Slip Boundary Condition:** The fluid velocity is zero at the inner wall of the vessel. This is a standard and accurate assumption in continuum fluid mechanics.\n\nWe apply this relationship to the two specified conditions: the baseline case and the stenosed case.\n\nFor the baseline (pre-stenosis) condition, the flow rate $Q_{0}$ through the vessel of radius $r_{0}$ is:\n$$Q_{0} = \\frac{\\pi r_{0}^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\nFor the stenosed condition, the flow rate $Q_{1}$ through the vessel of reduced radius $r_{1}$ is:\n$$Q_{1} = \\frac{\\pi r_{1}^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\nThe problem states that the pressure drop $\\Delta P$, fluid viscosity $\\eta$, and vessel length $L$ remain unchanged between the two states.\n\nTo find the fractional flow $Q_{1}/Q_{0}$, we take the ratio of the two expressions:\n$$\\frac{Q_{1}}{Q_{0}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{\\pi r_{1}^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{\\pi r_{0}^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L} \\right)}$$\nThe constants $\\pi$, $\\Delta P$, $8$, $\\eta$, and $L$ cancel out, simplifying the expression to a relationship purely dependent on the vessel radii:\n$$\\frac{Q_{1}}{Q_{0}} = \\frac{r_{1}^4}{r_{0}^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_{1}}{r_{0}}\\right)^4$$\nThis result demonstrates the powerful fourth-power dependence of flow rate on vessel radius, a cornerstone of cardiovascular physiology.\n\nWe are given the relationship between the stenosed radius and the baseline radius:\n$$r_{1} = \\frac{1}{2} r_{0}$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for the fractional flow:\n$$\\frac{Q_{1}}{Q_{0}} = \\left(\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} r_{0}}{r_{0}}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4$$\nCalculating the final numerical value:\n$$\\frac{Q_{1}}{Q_{0}} = \\frac{1^4}{2^4} = \\frac{1}{16} = 0.0625$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be reported as a dimensionless number rounded to four significant figures.

A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe movement of fluid across the capillary wall is governed by the net driving pressure, $P_{net}$, as described by the Starling equation. The problem statement defines the net driving pressure as the difference between the net hydrostatic pressure and the effective net oncotic pressure. Let $x$ be the position along the capillary, where $x$ ranges from $0$ at the arteriolar end to $L$ at the venular end.\n\nThe net driving pressure as a function of position, $P_{net}(x)$, is given by:\n$$P_{net}(x) = (P_{c}(x) - P_{i}) - \\sigma (\\pi_{c} - \\pi_{i})$$\nwhere:\n- $P_{c}(x)$ is the capillary hydrostatic pressure at position $x$.\n- $P_{i}$ is the interstitial hydrostatic pressure.\n- $\\pi_{c}$ is the capillary colloid osmotic pressure.\n- $\\pi_{i}$ is the interstitial colloid osmotic pressure.\n- $\\sigma$ is the solute reflection coefficient.\n\nNet filtration (fluid moving out of the capillary) occurs when $P_{net}(x) > 0$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the expression for $P_{c}(x)$. The problem states that $P_{c}(x)$ decreases linearly from $P_{c}(0) = 35$ mmHg to $P_{c}(L) = 15$ mmHg. A linear function can be written in the form $f(x) = mx+b$. For $P_{c}(x)$, the intercept at $x=0$ is $b = P_{c}(0) = 35$. The slope $m$ is given by the change in pressure over the length:\n$$m = \\frac{P_{c}(L) - P_{c}(0)}{L - 0} = \\frac{15 - 35}{L} = -\\frac{20}{L}$$\nThus, the capillary hydrostatic pressure at any position $x$ is:\n$$P_{c}(x) = P_{c}(0) + m x = 35 - 20\\frac{x}{L}$$\n\nNext, we assemble the terms for the net driving pressure. The hydrostatic pressure difference is:\n$$\\Delta P(x) = P_{c}(x) - P_{i} = \\left(35 - 20\\frac{x}{L}\\right) - (-3) = 38 - 20\\frac{x}{L}$$\nThe effective oncotic pressure difference is constant along the capillary:\n$$\\sigma(\\pi_{c} - \\pi_{i}) = 0.9 \\times (28 - 5) = 0.9 \\times 23 = 20.7$$\nAll pressures are in units of mmHg.\n\nNow, we can write the full expression for the net driving pressure $P_{net}(x)$:\n$$P_{net}(x) = \\left(38 - 20\\frac{x}{L}\\right) - 20.7$$\n$$P_{net}(x) = 17.3 - 20\\frac{x}{L}$$\n\nNet filtration occurs for all positions $x$ where $P_{net}(x) > 0$. We need to find the range of $x$ that satisfies this condition.\n$$17.3 - 20\\frac{x}{L} > 0$$\n$$17.3 > 20\\frac{x}{L}$$\n$$\\frac{17.3}{20} > \\frac{x}{L}$$\n$$0.865 > \\frac{x}{L}$$\n\nThis inequality shows that net filtration occurs for the portion of the capillary from $x=0$ up to the point where the fractional length $x/L$ is less than $0.865$. The point of zero net driving pressure, let's call it $x_{eq}$, is where filtration ceases and reabsorption begins. This equilibrium point is found by setting $P_{net}(x_{eq}) = 0$:\n$$0 = 17.3 - 20\\frac{x_{eq}}{L}$$\n$$\\frac{x_{eq}}{L} = \\frac{17.3}{20} = 0.865$$\nTherefore, net filtration occurs over the fraction of the capillary length from $x/L=0$ to $x/L=0.865$. The length of this filtration segment is $x_{eq} = 0.865L$. The fraction of the total capillary length that experiences net filtration is:\n$$\\text{Fraction} = \\frac{x_{eq}}{L} = 0.865$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be a unitless decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$0.865 = 0.8650$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8650}$$", "id": "5139434"}, {"introduction": "Connecting fundamental principles to clinical practice is a vital skill. This final exercise introduces Fractional Flow Reserve ($FFR$), a powerful diagnostic tool that directly applies the concepts of pressure, flow, and resistance to assess the severity of a coronary artery stenosis. By deriving the $FFR$ formula from a fluid dynamics model analogous to Ohm's law and applying it to real-world data, you will see how physicians quantify the physiological impact of a lesion to guide treatment decisions. [@problem_id:5139342]", "problem": "An interventional cardiology team is performing an invasive assessment of a coronary artery lesion during pharmacologically induced maximal hyperemia. The goal is to compute the Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR), defined physiologically as the ratio of maximal flow in the stenotic artery to maximal flow in the same artery without the stenosis. Let $P_{a}$ denote aortic pressure measured proximal to the lesion, $P_{d}$ denote pressure measured distal to the lesion, and $P_{v}$ denote coronary venous pressure. Assume the following hemodynamic bases and conditions are valid during stable maximal hyperemia: (i) the fluid analogue of Ohm’s law applies, so that for any vascular segment $Q = \\Delta P / R$, where $Q$ is flow, $\\Delta P$ is the pressure drop across the segment, and $R$ is resistance; (ii) microvascular resistance distal to the epicardial lesion achieves a minimal and approximately constant value under hyperemia; (iii) coronary venous pressure is negligible compared with proximal arterial pressure under these conditions.\n\nUsing these bases and conditions, first derive an expression for $FFR$ in terms of $P_{a}$, $P_{d}$, and $P_{v}$, and then reduce it under the assumption $P_{v} \\approx 0$ to an expression involving only $P_{a}$ and $P_{d}$.

Express the final numerical $FFR$ value only in your final answer.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of cardiovascular hemodynamics, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and free from subjective or ambiguous language. The problem requires a derivation based on fundamental principles, a numerical calculation, and a subsequent interpretation based on a provided clinical standard.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of an expression for Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR), its calculation for a specific case, and an interpretation of the result.\n\nFirst, we begin with the physiological definition of FFR provided: the ratio of maximal coronary blood flow in the presence of a stenosis ($Q_{stenotic}$) to the theoretical maximal flow in the same artery if it were normal ($Q_{normal}$).\n$$\nFFR = \\frac{Q_{stenotic}}{Q_{normal}}\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the fluid analogue of Ohm’s law, $Q = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R}$, is applicable. Here, $Q$ is blood flow, $\\Delta P$ is the pressure gradient across a vascular segment, and $R$ is the resistance of that segment.\n\nWe must define the flow in both the normal and stenotic scenarios. The coronary circulation can be modeled as the epicardial artery in series with the distal microvascular bed. The pressure drops from the aortic pressure, $P_{a}$, across this circuit to the coronary venous pressure, $P_{v}$.\n\nFor a hypothetical normal artery, the resistance of the large epicardial vessel is considered negligible. Therefore, the total resistance to flow is dominated by the microvascular resistance, which we denote as $R_{micro}$. Under conditions of maximal hyperemia, this resistance is at its minimum and is assumed to be constant (Assumption ii). The overall pressure gradient driving flow through the coronary system is $\\Delta P = P_{a} - P_{v}$.\nThus, the maximal flow in a normal artery, $Q_{normal}$, is given by:\n$$\nQ_{normal} = \\frac{P_{a} - P_{v}}{R_{micro}}\n$$\n\nFor the stenotic artery, the lesion introduces an additional resistance, $R_{stenosis}$, in series with the microvascular resistance. The flow through the stenotic artery, $Q_{stenotic}$, is driven by the same overall pressure gradient, $\\Delta P = P_{a} - P_{v}$, across the total resistance, $R_{total} = R_{stenosis} + R_{micro}$.\nHowever, a more direct way to express $Q_{stenotic}$ is to apply Ohm's law to the microvascular bed alone. The pressure gradient across the microvasculature is the difference between the pressure measured distal to the stenosis, $P_{d}$, and the coronary venous pressure, $P_{v}$. The resistance of this bed is $R_{micro}$. Therefore, the maximal flow through the stenotic artery, which must also be the flow through the downstream microvasculature, is:\n$$\nQ_{stenotic} = \\frac{P_{d} - P_{v}}{R_{micro}}\n$$\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions for $Q_{normal}$ and $Q_{stenotic}$ into the definition of FFR:\n$$\nFFR = \\frac{Q_{stenotic}}{Q_{normal}} = \\frac{\\frac{P_{d} - P_{v}}{R_{micro}}}{\\frac{P_{a} - P_{v}}{R_{micro}}}\n$$\nThe term for microvascular resistance, $R_{micro}$, cancels out. This cancellation is fundamentally important and relies on the assumption that maximal hyperemia ensures $R_{micro}$ is minimal, constant, and the same in both the actual stenotic state and the hypothetical normal state. This yields the first required expression for FFR:\n$$\nFFR = \\frac{P_{d} - P_{v}}{P_{a} - P_{v}}\n$$\n\nNext, we apply Assumption (iii), which states that coronary venous pressure is negligible, i.e., $P_{v} \\approx 0$. Substituting $P_{v} = 0$ into the expression:\n$$\nFFR = \\frac{P_{d} - 0}{P_{a} - 0} = \\frac{P_{d}}{P_{a}}\n$$\nThis is the simplified and clinically used formula for FFR.\n\nNow, we apply this expression to the measured data: aortic pressure $P_{a} = 96\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$ and distal coronary pressure $P_{d} = 75\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n$$\nFFR = \\frac{75}{96} = 0.78125\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$\nFFR \\approx 0.781\n$$\n\nFinally, we must interpret this result. The problem states that an FFR value below $0.80$ indicates a functionally significant epicardial stenosis. Our calculated value is $FFR \\approx 0.781$, which is less than $0.80$. Therefore, the lesion is determined to be functionally significant, meaning it substantially limits blood flow to the downstream myocardium during periods of maximal demand.\n\nThe question also asks to relate this functional significance to anatomical severity. An FFR of $0.781$ implies that the maximal blood flow to the heart muscle supplied by this artery is only $78.1\\%$ of what it would be if the artery were healthy. This degree of flow limitation is caused by a significant pressure drop across the stenosis, which is a direct consequence of the high resistance a physically severe lesion imposes on blood flow. While the correlation between anatomical stenosis (e.g., percent diameter reduction seen on an angiogram) and functional significance is not absolute, a functionally significant lesion with an FFR below $0.80$ is very likely to correspond to an anatomically severe stenosis, typically with a diameter reduction greater than $70\\%$. The FFR measurement provides physiological confirmation that the anatomical narrowing is indeed causing a hemodynamically important impairment of perfusion.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.781}\n$$", "id": "5139342"}]}
