A typical neuron's resting membrane potential is around $-70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. The fact that $E_K$ is very close to the resting potential signifies that the neuronal membrane at rest is highly permeable to potassium ions.

The small difference between $E_K$ ($-95.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) and the typical resting potential ($-70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) is due to the minor but non-zero permeability of the membrane to other ions, most notably sodium ($Na^+$), which has a positive equilibrium potential and leaks slowly into the cell, making the resting potential slightly more positive than $E_K$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-95.0}$$", "id": "5140403"}, {"introduction": "While the potassium gradient sets the primary stage, a real neuron's membrane is permeable to multiple ions.
