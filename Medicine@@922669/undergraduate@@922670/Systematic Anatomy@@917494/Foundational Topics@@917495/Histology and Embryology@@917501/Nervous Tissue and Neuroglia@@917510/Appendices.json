The problem is objective and uses precise, unambiguous language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe problem requires determining the total number of nodes of Ranvier along a specified length of an axon. We are given the total length of the axonal segment, $L$, and the length of a single myelinated internode, $l_{internode}$.\n\nFirst, we must ensure consistent units for all length measurements. We convert the total length $L$ from centimeters to millimeters.\n$$L = 5\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 5 \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 50\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nThe length of an internode is given as:\n$$l_{internode} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nThe problem states that the axon segment is composed of contiguous internodes of uniform length. Therefore, the total number of internodes, denoted as $N_{internodes}$, can be calculated by dividing the total length of the axon segment by the length of a single internode.\n$$N_{internodes} = \\frac{L}{l_{internode}} = \\frac{50\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{1\\,\\mathrm{mm}} = 50$$\nSo, there are exactly $50$ internodes in the segment from $x=0$ to $x=5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nThe problem defines that nodes of Ranvier are located at the boundaries between successive internodes. This establishes a direct topological relationship between the number of internodes and the number of nodes. An arrangement of $N_{internodes}$ contiguous segments requires $N_{internodes} + 1$ boundary points, or \"posts,\" to define them. This is a classic \"fencepost problem\".\n\nLet us visualize the structure:\n- A node exists at $x_0 = 0$. Let this be Node $0$.\n- The first internode spans from Node $0$ to Node $1$. Its length is $l_{internode} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Thus, Node $1$ is at position $x_1 = 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- The second internode spans from Node $1$ to Node $2$. Node $2$ is at position $x_2 = 2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- This pattern continues. The $k$-th internode (for $k \\ge 1$) spans from Node $(k-1)$ at position $x_{k-1} = (k-1) \\cdot l_{internode}$ to Node $k$ at position $x_k = k \\cdot l_{internode}$.\n\nThe final node is located at $x_{end} = 50\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The index $k_{final}$ of this final node can be found by:\n$$x_{final} = k_{final} \\cdot l_{internode}$$\n$$50\\,\\mathrm{mm} = k_{final} \\cdot 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n$$k_{final} = 50$$\nThe nodes are therefore indexed from $k=0$ (at $x=0$) to $k=50$ (at $x=50\\,\\mathrm{mm}$). The total number of nodes, $N_{nodes}$, is the count of integers in the set $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, 50\\}$.\n$$N_{nodes} = (k_{final} - 0) + 1 = 50 + 1 = 51$$\nThis confirms the relationship $N_{nodes} = N_{internodes} + 1$. Since we calculated $N_{internodes} = 50$, the total number of nodes is:\n$$N_{nodes} = 50 + 1 = 51$$\nThe count is inclusive of the starting node at $x=0$ and the ending node at $x=5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, which is consistent with this calculation. The total number of nodes of Ranvier encountered by the propagating action potential is $51$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{51}$$", "id": "5134335"}, {"introduction": "To understand the efficiency of myelinated axons, neuroscientists use the g-ratio, a single powerful parameter that captures the proportional investment in the axon versus its myelin sheath.
