The velocity of this propagation, $v_{\\mathrm{un}}$, can be derived from cable theory. A standard result from the analysis of core-conductor models (e.g., Offner, Weinberg, and Young, 1940) for an action potential propagating at a constant velocity under threshold stimulus is:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{un}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\tau_m r_i c_m}}$$\nwhere $\\tau_m$ is the membrane time constant, $r_i$ is the axial resistance per unit length, and $c_m$ is the membrane capacitance per unit length.\n\nThe membrane time constant $\\tau_m$ is the product of the specific membrane resistance $R_m$ and the specific membrane capacitance $C_m$:\n$$\\tau_m = R_m C_m$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\tau_m$, $r_i$, and $c_m$ into the velocity equation:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{un}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(R_m C_m) \\left(\\frac{4 R_i}{\\pi d_{\\mathrm{un}}^2}\\right) (C_m \\pi d_{\\mathrm{un}})}}$$\nSimplifying the expression within the square root:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{un}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{4 R_m C_m^2 R_i}{d_{\\mathrm{un}}}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{d_{\\mathrm{un}}}}{2 \\sqrt{R_m R_i C_m^2}}$$\nThis yields the final symbolic expression for the unmyelinated conduction velocity:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{un}} = \\frac{1}{2 C_m \\sqrt{R_i R_m}} \\sqrt{d_{\\mathrm{un}}}$$\nThis result shows the characteristic dependence of continuous conduction velocity on the square root of the axon diameter, $v_{\\mathrm{un}} \\propto \\sqrt{d_{\\mathrm{un}}}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically with the given parameters, ensuring all units are in the SI system.\nGivens:\n$d_{\\mathrm{un}} = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$C_m = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{F}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$\n$R_i = 1\\,\\Omega\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$R_m = 0.1\\,\\Omega\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n\n$$v_{\\mathrm{un}} = \\frac{1}{2 (0.01\\,\\mathrm{F}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}) \\sqrt{(1\\,\\Omega\\,\\mathrm{m})(0.1\\,\\Omega\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2})}} \\sqrt{2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}}$$\n$$v_{\\mathrm{un}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 \\times 10^{-6}}}{0.02 \\sqrt{0.1}}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n$$v_{\\mathrm{un}} = \\frac{1.41421... \\times 10^{-3}}{0.02 \\times 0.31622...}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n$$v_{\\mathrm{un}} = \\frac{1.41421... \\times 10^{-3}}{0.0063245...}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 0.2236067...\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the velocity is $v_{\\mathrm{un}} = 0.2236\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\n### Part 2: Myelinated Axon Conduction Velocity ($v_{\\mathrm{my}}$)\n\nFor a myelinated axon, propagation is saltatory. The problem specifies a model where the conduction time from one node of Ranvier to the next is dominated by the time required to charge the internodal membrane capacitance through the axial resistance of the internode. Velocity is the internode length $L$ divided by this propagation time delay $\\Delta t$.\n$$v_{\\mathrm{my}} = \\frac{L}{\\Delta t}$$\nThe time delay $\\Delta t$ is approximated by the characteristic charging time of the distributed RC cable that constitutes the internode. This time is proportional to the product of the total axial resistance $R_{\\mathrm{ax}}$ and the total internodal capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{int}}$.\n$$\\Delta t \\approx R_{\\mathrm{ax}} C_{\\mathrm{int}} = (r_i L) (c_{m, \\mathrm{eff}} L) = r_i c_{m, \\mathrm{eff}} L^2$$\nHere, $c_{m, \\mathrm{eff}}$ is the effective capacitance per unit length of the myelinated internode.\nThe velocity is therefore:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{my}} \\approx \\frac{L}{r_i c_{m, \\mathrm{eff}} L^2} = \\frac{1}{r_i c_{m, \\mathrm{eff}} L}$$\nWe now substitute the expressions for $r_i$, $c_{m, \\mathrm{eff}}$, and $L$.\n$r_i = \\frac{4 R_i}{\\pi d_{\\mathrm{my}}^2}$\nThe effective specific membrane capacitance for the internode is $C_{m,\\mathrm{eff}} = C_m/N$, where $N$ is the number of myelin lamellae. The effective capacitance per unit length is:\n$c_{m,\\mathrm{eff}} = C_{m,\\mathrm{eff}} (\\pi d_{\\mathrm{my}}) = \\frac{C_m}{N} (\\pi d_{\\mathrm{my}})$\nThe internode length is given by the scaling relation $L = \\beta d_{\\mathrm{my}}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the velocity expression:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{my}} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{4 R_i}{\\pi d_{\\mathrm{my}}^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{C_m \\pi d_{\\mathrm{my}}}{N}\\right) (\\beta d_{\\mathrm{my}})}$$\nThe terms involving $d_{\\mathrm{my}}$ cancel out:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{my}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{4 R_i C_m \\beta (\\pi d_{\\mathrm{my}}^2)}{N (\\pi d_{\\mathrm{my}}^2)}} = \\frac{N}{4 R_i C_m \\beta}$$\nThe number of myelin lamellae, $N$, is the total myelin thickness $t_{\\mathrm{my}}$ divided by the thickness of a single lamella $t_{\\ell}$:\n$$N = \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{my}}}{t_{\\ell}}$$\nThus, the final symbolic expression for the myelinated conduction velocity is:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{my}} = \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{my}}}{4 \\beta R_i C_m t_{\\ell}}$$\nUnder the given model assumptions ($L \\propto d$), the conduction velocity is independent of the axon diameter.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically.\nGivens:\n$d_{\\mathrm{my}} = 12\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 12 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$t_{\\mathrm{my}} = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$t_{\\ell} = 20\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 20 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$\\beta = 100$\n$R_i = 1\\,\\Omega\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$C_m = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{F}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$\n\nFirst, calculate the number of lamellae $N$:\n$$N = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{20 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-6}}{2 \\times 10^{-8}} = 100$$\nNow, substitute $N$ and other parameters into the velocity formula:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{my}} = \\frac{100}{4 (1\\,\\Omega\\,\\mathrm{m}) (0.01\\,\\mathrm{F}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}) (100)}$$\n$$v_{\\mathrm{my}} = \\frac{100}{4 \\times 0.01 \\times 100} = \\frac{100}{4} = 25\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nTo adhere to the four significant figures requirement, we write this as $v_{\\mathrm{my}} = 25.00\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nFinal compilation of results:\nVelocity of myelinated axon: $v_{\\mathrm{my}} = 25.00\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\nVelocity of unmyelinated axon: $v_{\\mathrm{un}} = 0.2236\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\nThe final answer is to be presented in a row matrix in the order [myelinated, unmyelinated].", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n25.00 & 0.2236\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5120880"}, {"introduction": "Building on the cellular level, this practice explores how tissues, as organized collections of cells and extracellular matrix, adapt to mechanical demands.

The language is objective and the values are physiologically realistic.\n\nThe problem consists of two parts: a qualitative explanation of tendon adaptation and a quantitative calculation of the change in thickness.\n\nPart 1: Explanation of Tendon Adaptation\n\nThe change in Achilles tendon thickness following a sustained resistance training program is an expected physiological adaptation rooted in the hierarchical structure of the tendon and the biological processes that govern tissue homeostasis and remodeling. This can be understood by examining the levels of structural organization from a systematic anatomy perspective.\n\n1.  **Molecular and Cellular Level:** The fundamental tensile-resistant unit of a tendon is the Type I collagen molecule (tropocollagen). These molecules are synthesized by specialized fibroblast-like cells called tenocytes, which are embedded within the tendon's extracellular matrix (ECM). Tenocytes are mechanosensitive; they can detect and respond to mechanical strain. The progressive loading from the exercise program imposes a controlled tensile strain on the tendon. This strain is transduced by the tenocytes into a biochemical response, a process known as mechanotransduction. A primary response to an appropriate level of sustained loading is the upregulation of genes responsible for the synthesis of new ECM components, most notably Type I collagen.\n\n2.  **Tissue Level (Microstructure):** Newly synthesized collagen molecules self-assemble into larger, hierarchical structures. They form microfibrils, which then aggregate into collagen fibrils. These fibrils are the primary structural elements that bear tensile load. The increased synthesis of collagen leads to an increase in either the number of fibrils (hyperplasia) or, more commonly, the diameter of existing fibrils (hypertrophy). This process results in a greater overall volume of collagenous material within the ECM.\n\n3.  **Tissue Level (Macrostructure):** Collagen fibrils are bundled together to form collagen fibers, and these fibers are in turn grouped into fascicles. The increase in fibril diameter and density translates to an increase in the cross-sectional area of the fibers and fascicles. This growth at the tissue level is what manifests as a measurable increase in the gross dimensions of the tendon, such as its anteroposterior thickness. The assumption that the averaged thickness measurement reflects this steady-state ECM content is key, as it treats the measured dimension as a direct proxy for the underlying biological adaptation.\n\n4.  **Organ Level:** The Achilles tendon, as a complete organ, thus becomes thicker and denser. This adaptation increases its mechanical stiffness and tensile strength, allowing it to more effectively transmit the forces generated by the calf muscles (triceps surae) to the heel bone (calcaneus) and to withstand higher peak loads, thereby reducing the risk of injury.\n\nAnatomical variation across these levels influences the magnitude of this adaptive change:\n-   **Genetic Variation:** At the cellular level, individual genetic differences can affect the sensitivity of tenocytes to mechanical strain, the efficiency of the collagen synthesis pathway, or the expression of growth factors. This results in some individuals being \"high responders\" and others \"low responders\" to the same training stimulus.\n-   **Anatomical Variation:** At the tissue and organ level, baseline anatomical characteristics such as initial tendon size, collagen fiber density, and fiber orientation vary among individuals. These pre-existing conditions can influence the relative magnitude of the hypertrophic response.\n-   **Systemic and Biomechanical Variation:** Systemic factors like age, sex, and hormonal status modulate the body's capacity for tissue repair and adaptation. Furthermore, individual differences in biomechanics (e.g., foot strike pattern, joint alignment) can alter the strain distribution within the tendon, leading to non-uniform adaptation and different overall changes between people performing the same exercise.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of Percent Change in Tendon Thickness\n\nThe problem provides baseline and post-training measurements and specifies the calculation method.\n\nThe baseline measurements are $B_1 = 5.3$ mm, $B_2 = 5.1$ mm, and $B_3 = 5.2$ mm.\nThe mean baseline thickness, $\\bar{T}_{base}$, is calculated as:\n$$ \\bar{T}_{base} = \\frac{5.3 + 5.1 + 5.2}{3} = \\frac{15.6}{3} = 5.2 \\text{ mm} $$\n\nThe post-training measurements after $12$ weeks are $P_1 = 5.7$ mm, $P_2 = 5.5$ mm, and $P_3 = 5.6$ mm.\nThe mean post-training thickness, $\\bar{T}_{post}$, is calculated as:\n$$ \\bar{T}_{post} = \\frac{5.7 + 5.5 + 5.6}{3} = \\frac{16.8}{3} = 5.6 \\text{ mm} $$\n\nThe percent change, expressed as a decimal (unitless relative change), is calculated with respect to the baseline value.\n$$ \\text{Relative Change} = \\frac{\\bar{T}_{post} - \\bar{T}_{base}}{\\bar{T}_{base}} $$\nSubstituting the calculated mean values:\n$$ \\text{Relative Change} = \\frac{5.6 - 5.2}{5.2} = \\frac{0.4}{5.2} $$\nTo simplify the fraction:\n$$ \\frac{0.4}{5.2} = \\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{1}{13} $$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$$ \\frac{1}{13} \\approx 0.0769230769... $$\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to four significant figures.

Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is divided into two parts, corresponding to the two tasks in the problem statement.\n\nTask 1: Derivation of the measured voxel intensity expression.\n\nThe solution begins from the first principle provided: the measured voxel intensity, which we denote as $I_{\\text{voxel}}$, is proportional to the spatial average of the local tissue signal over the voxel volume. In the standard formulation of this model, the proportionality constant is taken to be unity, as the intensity is typically defined as this average value. Let the local signal intensity at a position vector $\\vec{r}$ within the voxel be $I(\\vec{r})$, and the total volume of the voxel be $V$. The spatial average is defined by the volume integral:\n$$\nI_{\\text{voxel}} = \\frac{1}{V} \\int_{V} I(\\vec{r}) \\, dV\n$$\nThe voxel volume $V$ is composed of two distinct tissue sub-volumes, $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$, such that $V = V_{1} + V_{2}$. The integral can be decomposed into a sum of integrals over these two sub-volumes:\n$$\nI_{\\text{voxel}} = \\frac{1}{V} \\left( \\int_{V_{1}} I(\\vec{r}) \\, dV + \\int_{V_{2}} I(\\vec{r}) \\, dV \\right)\n$$\nAccording to the second principle, each tissue contributes a uniform true signal intensity. This means the local intensity $I(\\vec{r})$ is constant within each sub-volume. Specifically, $I(\\vec{r}) = I_1$ for all $\\vec{r} \\in V_1$, and $I(\\vec{r}) = I_2$ for all $\\vec{r} \\in V_2$. We can substitute these constant values into the integrals:\n$$\nI_{\\text{voxel}} = \\frac{1}{V} \\left( \\int_{V_{1}} I_{1} \\, dV + \\int_{V_{2}} I_{2} \\, dV \\right)\n$$\nSince $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ are constants with respect to the spatial integration, they can be factored out of their respective integrals:\n$$\nI_{\\text{voxel}} = \\frac{1}{V} \\left( I_{1} \\int_{V_{1}} dV + I_{2} \\int_{V_{2}} dV \\right)\n$$\nThe integral of the differential volume element $dV$ over a region is equal to the volume of that region.

Substituting these definitions provides the final expression for the measured voxel intensity:\n$$\nI_{\\text{voxel}} = f_{1}I_{1} + f_{2}I_{2}\n$$\nThis expression, known as the linear mixing model, shows that the measured intensity of a partial volume voxel is the weighted average of the true intensities of the constituent tissues, where the weights are the respective volume fractions.\n\nTask 2: Computation of the measured voxel intensity for a specific case.\n\nFor this task, we apply the derived formula to the given numerical values for a voxel at the gray matter–cerebrospinal fluid interface.

The volume fraction of cerebrospinal fluid, $f_{\\mathrm{CSF}}$, is given by:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{CSF}} = 1 - f_{\\mathrm{GM}} = 1 - 0.65 = 0.35\n$$\nUsing the formula derived in Task 1, we can compute the expected measured voxel intensity, $I_{\\text{voxel}}$:\n$$\nI_{\\text{voxel}} = f_{\\mathrm{GM}} I_{\\mathrm{GM}} + f_{\\mathrm{CSF}} I_{\\mathrm{CSF}}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nI_{\\text{voxel}} = (0.65)(800) + (0.35)(200)\n$$\nPerforming the multiplication for each term:\n$$\nI_{\\text{voxel}} = 520 + 70\n$$\nSumming the terms gives the final intensity:\n$$\nI_{\\text{voxel}} = 590 \\text{ a.u.}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.
