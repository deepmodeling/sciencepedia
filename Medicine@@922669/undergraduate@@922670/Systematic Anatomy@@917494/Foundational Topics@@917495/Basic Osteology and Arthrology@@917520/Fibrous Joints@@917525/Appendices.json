The fundamental definition of average normal stress is provided as the force, $F$, applied perpendicularly to an area, $A$.\n\nThe governing equation is:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{F}{A}\n$$\n\nThe given values are an applied load of $F = 120\\,\\mathrm{N}$ and an effective load-bearing area of $A = 25\\,\\mathrm{mm^2}$.

We must perform a unit conversion. The definition of a Pascal (Pa) is $1\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 1\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}$. A megapascal is $1\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n\nTo convert from $\\mathrm{N/mm^2}$ to $\\mathrm{MPa}$, we establish the relationship between $\\mathrm{mm^2}$ and $\\mathrm{m^2}$:\n$1\\,\\mathrm{m} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 10^3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n$$\n1\\,\\mathrm{m^2} = (10^3\\,\\mathrm{mm})^2 = 10^6\\,\\mathrm{mm^2}\n$$\nTherefore, $1\\,\\mathrm{mm^2} = 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$.\n\nSubstituting this into our calculated stress unit:\n$$\n1\\,\\mathrm{N/mm^2} = \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{N}}{10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}} = 10^6\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2} = 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 1\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\nThis establishes the direct equivalence: $1\\,\\mathrm{N/mm^2} = 1\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nThus, the calculated stress is:\n$$\n\\sigma = 4.8\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\n\nThe final step in the calculation is to adhere to the specified precision of three significant figures. The value $4.8$ has two significant figures. To express it with three, we add a trailing zero.\n$$\n\\sigma = 4.80\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\n\n### Qualitative Interpretation\n\nThe second part of the task is to interpret this result. The computed stress is $\\sigma = 4.80\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$. The problem states that such tissues \"typically tolerate single-episode physiological tensile stresses in the single-digit megapascals before microfailure becomes likely\".\n\nThe term \"single-digit megapascals\" refers to the range from $1\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ up to, but not including, $10\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$. The calculated stress of $4.80\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ falls squarely within this range. It is not an insignificant value; it is approximately half of the maximum value in this nominal tolerance band. Therefore, the computed stress represents a substantial load condition that approaches the physiological stress limits of the tissue.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe constitutive equation for a Kelvin–Voigt model, which consists of a purely elastic spring and a purely viscous dashpot arranged in parallel, is derived by summing the stresses in each component while the strain is common to both. The total stress $\\sigma(t)$ is the sum of the stress in the spring, $\\sigma_s = E\\varepsilon(t)$, and the stress in the dashpot, $\\sigma_d = \\eta \\frac{d\\varepsilon(t)}{dt}$.\n\nTherefore, the governing differential equation is:\n$$ \\sigma(t) = E\\varepsilon(t) + \\eta \\frac{d\\varepsilon(t)}{dt} $$\nThe problem describes a creep test, where a constant stress $\\sigma$ is applied at $t=0$ and held. Thus, for $t \\geq 0$, $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma = \\text{constant}$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\sigma = E\\varepsilon + \\eta \\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt} $$\nThis is a first-order, linear, non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation for the strain $\\varepsilon(t)$. We can rearrange it into the standard form:\n$$ \\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt} + \\frac{E}{\\eta}\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\eta} $$\nThe general solution to this equation is the sum of the homogeneous solution, $\\varepsilon_h(t)$, and a particular solution, $\\varepsilon_p(t)$.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is $\\frac{d\\varepsilon_h}{dt} + \\frac{E}{\\eta}\\varepsilon_h = 0$, which has the solution:\n$$ \\varepsilon_h(t) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta}t\\right) $$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the right-hand side is a constant, we assume a constant particular solution $\\varepsilon_p(t) = A$. Substituting this into the differential equation gives:\n$$ 0 + \\frac{E}{\\eta}A = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\eta} \\implies A = \\frac{\\sigma}{E} $$\nThe particular solution represents the steady-state strain as $t \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe general solution for the strain is:\n$$ \\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_h(t) + \\varepsilon_p(t) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta}t\\right) + \\frac{\\sigma}{E} $$\nTo find the constant $C$, we apply the initial condition. The problem states the ligament is unstrained at $t<0$. For a Kelvin-Voigt model, the viscous dashpot resists instantaneous changes in strain. An infinite strain rate would be required for the strain to change instantaneously, which would require an infinite stress. Therefore, the strain at the moment the load is applied must be zero: $\\varepsilon(0) = 0$.\n\nApplying this condition to the general solution at $t=0$:\n$$ \\varepsilon(0) = C \\exp(0) + \\frac{\\sigma}{E} = C + \\frac{\\sigma}{E} $$\n$$ 0 = C + \\frac{\\sigma}{E} \\implies C = -\\frac{\\sigma}{E} $$\nSubstituting this value of $C$ back into the general solution gives the specific solution for the creep response:\n$$ \\varepsilon(t) = -\\frac{\\sigma}{E} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta}t\\right) + \\frac{\\sigma}{E} $$\nFactoring out the term $\\frac{\\sigma}{E}$ yields the final expression for the time-dependent strain:\n$$ \\varepsilon(t) = \\frac{\\sigma}{E} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta}t\\right)\\right) $$\nThe term $\\tau = \\frac{\\eta}{E}$ is known as the retardation time, which characterizes the time scale of the creep response.

This is the characteristic time scale over which the viscous effects are significant. The strain at any time $t$ is given by $\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{\\infty}(1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau))$. After a time equal to a few multiples of $\\tau$ (e.g., $t=5\\tau = 0.625\\,\\mathrm{s}$), the strain will have reached over $99\\%$ of its final value.\nThe specified time of $t=60\\,\\mathrm{s}$ is equal to $480$ retardation times ($60/0.125 = 480$). At this point, the exponential term $\\exp(-480)$ is practically zero, meaning the strain has fully reached its equilibrium or steady-state value of $\\varepsilon_{\\infty} = \\sigma/E$.\nThis implies that for a ligament with these material properties, the short-term creep behavior is extremely rapid. The time-dependent deformation (creep) is essentially complete within the first second of sustained loading. Thereafter, for the remainder of the $60\\,\\mathrm{s}$ period, the ligament behaves as a simple elastic solid, maintaining a constant strain with no further significant time-dependent deformation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.005000}$$", "id": "5110716"}]}
