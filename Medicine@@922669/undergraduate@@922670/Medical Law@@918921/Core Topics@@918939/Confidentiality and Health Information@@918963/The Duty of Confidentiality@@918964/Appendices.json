This exercise explores a fundamental technique in statistical disclosure control: the minimum cell-size rule.

Under the common law duty of confidentiality and professional codes, disclosures of health information are only permissible if the data are not reasonably identifiable. In practice, to mitigate re-identification risk consistent with the “motivated intruder” test and data minimization principles under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), many organizations apply a minimum cell-size rule: do not publish an aggregate if the cohort size is below a threshold $n_{\\min}$, because very small groups risk singling out individuals.\n\nAssume the policy threshold is $n_{\\min} = 5$, and the team size is $n = 4$. Using these foundations, construct a minimal binary decision rule that encodes the legal-policy principle “publish only if the cohort size meets or exceeds the minimum threshold,” by mapping the pair $(n, n_{\\min})$ to $\\{0,1\\}$, where the value $1$ flags that publication would breach the duty of confidentiality and the value $0$ flags that it would not.

The use of a minimum cell-size threshold is a standard, well-established technique in statistical disclosure limitation to prevent re-identification of individuals in aggregate data, a core concern in fields like medical statistics and public health. The legal and regulatory context provided (common law duty of confidentiality, GDPR) is an accurate framing for such a technical control.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information to construct and evaluate the required function. The variables, conditions, and desired output format are clearly defined.\n\nThe problem is objective. The rule is based on a clear, formalizable logical condition, not on subjective interpretation.\n\nThe problem setup is complete and internally consistent. There are no missing data or contradictory constraints.\n\nThe values provided ($n=4, n_{\\min}=5$) are realistic and do not pose any physical or logical impossibility.\n\nTherefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe task is to construct a binary decision rule, which we can denote as a function $B(n, n_{\\min})$, that formalizes the given policy.\n\nThe policy states that publication is permissible if and only if the cohort size $n$ is greater than or equal to the minimum threshold $n_{\\min}$. We can express this condition for permissible publication as the inequality:\n$$\nn \\ge n_{\\min}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that an output of $0$ corresponds to a permissible publication (no breach of confidentiality). Therefore:\n$$\nB(n, n_{\\min}) = 0 \\quad \\text{if} \\quad n \\ge n_{\\min}\n$$\nConversely, a breach of confidentiality occurs if publication is not permissible. This happens when the condition for permissible publication is false. The logical negation of $n \\ge n_{\\min}$ is $n  n_{\\min}$.\n$$\n\\neg(n \\ge n_{\\min}) \\iff n  n_{\\min}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that an output of $1$ flags a breach of confidentiality. Thus:\n$$\nB(n, n_{\\min}) = 1 \\quad \\text{if} \\quad n  n_{\\min}\n$$\nCombining these two cases, we can write the complete definition of the binary decision rule as a piecewise function:\n$$\nB(n, n_{\\min}) =\n\\begin{cases}\n1  \\text{if } n  n_{\\min} \\\\\n0  \\text{if } n \\ge n_{\\min}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis function is a minimal representation of the specified rule. It is an indicator function for the condition $n  n_{\\min}$.\n\nNow, we must compute the value of this rule for the given inputs: the team size is $n = 4$ and the policy threshold is $n_{\\min} = 5$. We need to evaluate $B(4, 5)$.\n\nWe compare the values of $n$ and $n_{\\min}$:\n$$\nn = 4\n$$\n$$\nn_{\\min} = 5\n$$\nThe condition to check is $n  n_{\\min}$, which is $4  5$. This inequality is true.\n\nAccording to the definition of our function $B(n, n_{\\min})$, if $n  n_{\\min}$ is true, the function's value is $1$.\nTherefore, for $n=4$ and $n_{\\min}=5$, the publication of the aggregate illness rate would be a breach of the confidentiality rule, and the decision rule outputs a value of $1$.\n\n$$\nB(4, 5) = 1\n$$\nThis confirms that for a team of size $4$, publishing data under a minimum threshold of $5$ is not permitted.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "4510698"}, {"introduction": "The \"minimum necessary\" principle is a cornerstone of modern data protection law, requiring that disclosures of confidential information be limited to what is essential for a specific purpose.

Under the legal duty of confidentiality, the institution operationalizes the “minimum necessary” principle as a quantitative limit on surplus disclosure for any non-treatment use or disclosure: the fraction of disclosed information that is not strictly necessary for the stated purpose must be less than a fixed upper bound. Let the total dataset contain $N$ image slices, and let the proportion of slices strictly necessary to answer the quality-assurance question be $p_{r}$.

The absolute number of necessary slices is therefore $N_n = p_r N$.\nLet $N_d$ be the number of slices in the proposed disclosure.\n\nThe problem defines the surplus proportion, $p_s$, as \"the fraction of the disclosed dataset that is not strictly necessary for the stated purpose.\" To formalize this, we must first determine the number of non-necessary slices within the disclosed set. Assuming the disclosure contains all necessary slices (as any other disclosure would be inadequate for the primary purpose), the number of surplus (non-necessary) slices included in the disclosure is the total number of disclosed slices minus the number of necessary slices.\nNumber of surplus slices = $N_d - N_n$.\nSubstituting the expression for $N_n$, we have:\nNumber of surplus slices = $N_d - p_r N$.\n\nThe surplus proportion $p_s$ is this quantity divided by the total number of disclosed slices, $N_d$:\n$$p_s = \\frac{N_d - p_r N}{N_d}$$\nThis can be simplified to:\n$$p_s = 1 - \\frac{p_r N}{N_d}$$\n\nThe institutional policy sets a limit $L$ on this surplus proportion, such that compliance requires $p_s \\leq L$.\nThe violation margin, $V$, is defined as the amount by which $p_s$ exceeds this limit:\n$$V = p_s - L$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $p_s$ into the definition of $V$, we obtain the general expression for the violation margin:\n$$V = \\left(1 - \\frac{p_r N}{N_d}\\right) - L$$\nThis expression is valid for any disclosure size $N_d \\geq N_n$.\n\nWe are now asked to evaluate $V$ for a specific case:\n1.

The problem states that this should be computed under the expected value principle from decision theory. We are given a single harmful outcome with severity $s$ and probability of occurrence $p$. The severity is a cardinal value on a scale from $0$ to $100$. The alternative outcome is the absence of harm, which has a severity of $0$. The probability of this non-harmful outcome is complementary to $p$, i.e., $1-p$.\n\nAccording to the expected value principle, the expected harm $H_E$ is the sum of the products of each outcome's value (severity) and its probability.\n$$\nH_E = (s \\times p) + (0 \\times (1-p))\n$$\nSimplifying this expression, we find that the expected harm is the product of the severity and its probability:\n$$\nH_E = sp\n$$\n\nNext, we formalize the decision rule.
