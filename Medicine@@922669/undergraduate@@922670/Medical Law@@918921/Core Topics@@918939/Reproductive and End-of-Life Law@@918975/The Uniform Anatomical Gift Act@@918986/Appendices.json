During routine document and registry checks, the hospital’s decedent affairs team discovers the following, each appearing facially valid and attributable to the decedent:\n\n- State donor registry entry dated 2021-05-14, created during a Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) transaction, stating: “Consent to donate all organs and tissues.”\n- A second state donor registry entry dated 2023-02-10 at 10:15, created at a later DMV renewal, stating: “Consent limited to corneas only.”\n- A physical wallet donor card signed and dated 2024-03-05, which states: “I do NOT wish to be an organ or tissue donor,” with the decedent’s handwritten signature.\n\nThe decedent’s family requests that donation proceed, pointing to the earlier registry consent.

The analysis rests on the UAGA's principles for making, amending, and revoking anatomical gifts and refusals.\n\n**First Principles of the 2006 UAGA:**\n\n1.  **Forms of Declaration**: The UAGA recognizes several valid methods for an individual to declare their intent. Section 4 and Section 5 establish that a gift can be made via a donor registry, a will, or a \"document of gift,\" which includes a signed donor card. Section 7 establishes that a refusal can also be made by a signed record. All three documents presented in the problem are facially valid forms of declaration under the Act.\n\n2.  **Rule for Resolving Conflicts (Temporal Precedence)**: The UAGA provides a clear \"last-in-time\" rule to resolve conflicts among multiple valid documents. Section 6(e) states: \"In the absence of an express, contrary indication by the donor, a document of gift that is later in time than a previous document of gift or a refusal revokes the previous document of gift or refusal to the extent of any conflict.\" This principle applies to both gifts and refusals. The most recent, legally valid expression of the donor's intent is the one that controls.\n\n3.  **Finality of Donor's Decision**: The 2006 UAGA is designed to give ultimate authority to the donor's own decision.\n    -   An unrevoked gift made by the donor is irrevocable upon death and does not require the consent of any other person (Section 8(a)).\n    -   Crucially, a refusal by the donor to make an anatomical gift is legally binding and bars any other person from making a gift of the donor's body or parts (Section 7(c)).\n\n**Application of Principles to the Facts:**\n\nLet us denote the three instruments chronologically:\n-   $I_1$: Registry gift of \"all organs and tissues\" dated 2021-05-14.\n-   $I_2$: Registry gift of \"corneas only\" dated 2023-02-10.\n-   $I_3$: Signed wallet card constituting a refusal, dated 2024-03-05.\n\nThe temporal order is $I_1 \\rightarrow I_2 \\rightarrow I_3$. We apply the last-in-time rule sequentially.\n\n-   At the time of $I_2$ (2023-02-10), the more recent and more specific gift of \"corneas only\" amends and supersedes the earlier, broader gift $I_1$ of \"all organs and tissues.\" Thus, as of this date, the operative intent was a limited gift of corneas.\n\n-   At the time of $I_3$ (2024-03-05), the signed wallet card expresses a refusal to be a donor. As this is the most recent instrument, dated after both registry entries, it revokes all prior gifts, including the limited gift of corneas ($I_2$).\n\nTherefore, the legally operative instrument is the wallet card from 2024-03-05, which is a refusal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the UAGA's last-in-time rule, the decedent's final and controlling intent was a refusal to donate. According to Section 7(c) of the UAGA, this refusal is an absolute bar to donation. The family's request to proceed with donation is legally irrelevant and cannot override the decedent's documented refusal. Consequently, procurement must not proceed.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The earliest registry entry controls because registry records are superior to informal paper records; procurement should proceed for all organs and tissues.**\nThis option is incorrect. The UAGA employs a last-in-time rule, not a first-in-time rule. Furthermore, it does not grant absolute superiority to a registry entry over a later-executed signed document like a wallet card. Both are valid forms of declaration. The most recent valid declaration controls.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The most recent registry entry controls, and only registry entries count under the UAGA; procurement should be limited to corneas.**\nThis option is incorrect. The premise that \"only registry entries count\" is false. A signed wallet card is a valid \"document of gift\" or refusal under the UAGA. Since the wallet card is dated later than the most recent registry entry, the card's refusal is the controlling instrument, not the registry entry for corneas.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The later-signed wallet card is a valid refusal that revokes prior gifts; procurement must not proceed, and no other person may authorize donation.**\nThis option is correct. It accurately applies the UAGA's principles. The wallet card is a valid form of refusal. As the latest dated instrument, it revokes all prior conflicting gifts according to the last-in-time rule. The refusal is legally binding and, per the UAGA, prohibits anyone else, including family, from authorizing donation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Family consent can override a donor’s refusal if there is any earlier registry gift; procurement should proceed according to the earliest registry consent.**\nThis option is incorrect. It directly contradicts a central tenet of the 2006 UAGA, which is to honor the donor's autonomy. A documented refusal by the donor cannot be overridden by the family. The family's wishes are subordinate to the decedent's own legally declared intent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. All instruments are void due to conflict; hospital policy should default to next-of-kin consent without regard to the decedent’s documents.**\nThis option is incorrect. The UAGA is explicitly structured to resolve such conflicts, not to void the instruments. The last-in-time rule provides a clear resolution. Defaulting to next-of-kin arises when the decedent's wishes are unknown, not when they are documented but require statutory interpretation to resolve conflicts.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4516123"}, {"introduction": "Often, a person may pass away without ever having documented their wishes on organ donation, leaving the decision to others. The UAGA addresses this by establishing a clear, prioritized hierarchy of surrogate decision-makers who may authorize a gift on the decedent's behalf. By analyzing this scenario [@problem_id:4516109], you will learn to navigate this statutory hierarchy, a fundamental skill for understanding who has the legal authority to consent, particularly in cases involving non-traditional family relationships.", "problem": "A hospital identifies a decedent D who died unexpectedly in the emergency department. There is no documented first-person authorization by D (no enrollment in a donor registry, no advance directive granting authority to an agent), and no health care power of attorney naming an agent. The hospital H contacts its designated organ procurement organization O to determine whether an anatomical gift may lawfully be made. A longtime partner P of D arrives and states that P and D cohabited continuously for 10 years and shared day-to-day caregiving responsibilities but never married and never registered as a legally recognized domestic partner. H and O jointly document reasonable efforts over 6 hours to identify any person with potentially higher priority under the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA), including searching medical records for emergency contacts, consulting police databases for next of kin, and calling the decedent’s employer and landlord; no adult children, parents, adult siblings, grandparents, or legally recognized domestic partner are identified or reasonably available. There is no evidence that D refused donation during life. Under the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA), which option best states who may authorize the anatomical gift and on what basis?\n\nA. The longtime partner P may authorize as an “adult who exhibited special care and concern for the decedent,” provided O has made reasonable inquiries confirming that no higher-priority class is reasonably available and there is no known contrary indication by D.\n\nB. The hospital H may authorize donation without any surrogate because there are no known relatives, and P lacks formal legal status.\n\nC. The county medical examiner may unilaterally consent to a full organ donation whenever no family is located, regardless of investigative needs or statutory limits.\n\nD. Only a legally recognized spouse or registered domestic partner may authorize; because P lacks formal legal recognition, donation cannot proceed in the absence of a spouse or registered partner.", "solution": "The problem requires applying the hierarchy of surrogate decision-makers as defined by the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA) when a decedent has not made a first-person authorization. The UAGA (2006 revision) provides a prioritized list of individuals who may make the gift on the decedent's behalf in Section 9.\n\nThe priority list is as follows:\n1.  An agent of the decedent.\n2.  The spouse of the decedent.\n3.  Adult children of the decedent.\n4.  Parents of the decedent.\n5.  Adult siblings of the decedent.\n6.  Adult grandchildren of the decedent.\n7.  Grandparents of the decedent.\n8.  An adult who exhibited special care and concern for the decedent.\n9.  A guardian of the person of the decedent.\n10. Any other person having authority to dispose of the body.\n\nThe problem states that due diligence by the hospital and OPO established that no individuals from classes 1 through 7 were identifiable or reasonably available. This moves the legal inquiry to class 8: \"an adult who exhibited special care and concern for the decedent.\" The description of the partner P—\"cohabited continuously for 10 years and shared day-to-day caregiving responsibilities\"—is a textbook example of the relationship this category is intended to cover. It allows individuals with close, personal relationships but no formal legal status to make decisions consistent with their knowledge of the decedent.\n\nFor P to authorize the gift, two conditions must be met: (1) no individual in a higher-priority class is reasonably available, and (2) there is no known refusal by the decedent to make a gift. The problem confirms that reasonable efforts were made to find higher-priority relatives and that no refusal is on record. Therefore, P has the legal authority to authorize the gift.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis:**\n\nA. This option correctly identifies P's authority under the \"special care and concern\" category and accurately includes the necessary preconditions: that no higher-priority class is reasonably available and that no contrary wish from the decedent is known. This is the correct legal conclusion.\n\nB. This is incorrect. The UAGA does not grant hospitals the authority to authorize donation. This option also wrongly dismisses P's standing, which is explicitly established under class 8 of the surrogate hierarchy.\n\nC. This is incorrect. The medical examiner's authority to consent to donation is very limited, subject to statutory restrictions and investigative needs, and does not apply when a valid surrogate, such as P, is available.\n\nD. This is incorrect. It reflects an outdated or incomplete understanding of the UAGA. The 2006 revision includes a broad hierarchy far beyond just a spouse or registered partner, specifically to address situations like the one described.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4516109"}, {"introduction": "A donor's decision is not always a simple yes or no; it can include specific limitations on how the anatomical gift may be used. A core principle of the UAGA is the profound respect for donor autonomy, which extends to honoring these express limitations, such as restricting a gift to \"research only.\" This practice [@problem_id:4516076] challenges you to uphold the legal authority of a donor's documented instructions, even when faced with compelling ethical arguments to do otherwise, reinforcing the primacy of the donor's explicit wishes.", "problem": "An Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) is notified of a decedent who, during life, executed a documented anatomical gift stating: “I consent to donation for research only.” The documentation appears on the state donor registry and is also printed on a wallet card signed by the decedent. The OPO confirms the decedent’s identity and the validity of the documentation. While evaluating the decedent’s organs, the OPO identifies a histocompatible heart that could be allocated immediately to an identified pediatric recipient with an urgent, life-saving need. The decedent’s family asks the OPO to “do what saves a life,” and the transplant team is standing by. Assume the jurisdiction has adopted the Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA) (2006), without material deviation, and that there is no evidence the decedent revoked or amended the document of gift. \n\nThe UAGA requires that a donor’s specified purpose be honored if practicable and that this documented intent controls the gift; third parties generally may not override an express limitation. Given these principles, which of the following is the legally permissible course of action?\n\nA. Proceed with transplantation due to the urgent, life-saving need; under the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, public health necessity creates an exception to donor-imposed purpose limitations.\n\nB. Decline to transplant and honor the “research only” restriction by recovering the organ for research if medically suitable; do not proceed to transplantation notwithstanding family requests or clinical urgency.\n\nC. Seek and rely on next-of-kin authorization to change the purpose from research to transplantation; with family consent, proceeding to transplant is lawful despite the donor’s limitation.\n\nD. If no research institution will accept the organ promptly, repurpose it for transplantation to avoid waste; the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act allows reallocation when the specified purpose is not immediately practicable.", "solution": "We begin from the Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (2006) core principles, which supply the governing legal baseline for analysis:\n\n- Purpose categories: The statute recognizes 4 authorized purposes for anatomical gifts: transplantation, therapy, research, and education. A donor may specify one or more purposes. If a donor specifies a purpose, that limitation is binding; the donee and procurement entities must honor the specified purpose if practicable. If no purpose is specified, the default is broad use across the 4 purposes.\n- Donor’s intent controls: The Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act prioritizes the donor’s documented wishes. Once a donor has made a documented anatomical gift with specified terms, third parties generally may not amend or revoke those terms after the donor’s death. Family disagreement, public interest arguments, or clinical urgency do not authorize override of the decedent’s explicit limitation.\n- Role of Organ Procurement Organizations: An OPO must determine the existence and content of a document of gift and act consistently with it, including honoring purpose limitations. The OPO may not convert a research-only gift into a transplant gift absent a valid amendment attributable to the donor under the statute.\n\nApplying these principles to the scenario:\n\n- The decedent’s document of gift unambiguously restricts use to “research only.” Under the statute, this expresses the donor’s chosen purpose and thus limits the permissible use of the donated parts.\n- No evidence suggests that the donor amended or revoked the gift. The family’s request, while ethically weighty, does not supply legal authority to disregard the donor’s explicit limitation.\n- Clinical urgency and potential life-saving benefit do not create a statutory exception that allows conversion from research to transplantation.\n- If “research only” cannot be effectuated (for example, no research program accepts the organ), the OPO is not thereby authorized to transplant; rather, the limitation remains controlling, and the part should not be used in a manner contrary to the donor’s terms.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. “Proceed with transplantation due to the urgent, life-saving need; public health necessity creates an exception to donor-imposed purpose limitations.” The Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act contains no general “public health necessity” or “life-saving emergency” exception that permits an OPO to override a donor’s explicit purpose restriction. Donor intent controls, and purpose limitations must be honored. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nB. “Decline to transplant and honor the ‘research only’ restriction by recovering the organ for research if medically suitable; do not proceed to transplantation notwithstanding family requests or clinical urgency.” This aligns with the statute’s core rule that the donor’s documented purpose controls and must be honored if practicable. The OPO’s permissible path is to use the organ for research as specified and to decline transplantation that contravenes the limitation. Verdict — Correct.\n\nC. “Seek and rely on next-of-kin authorization to change the purpose from research to transplantation.” Under the Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, next-of-kin authority is subordinate to the donor’s express wishes. Family cannot amend or override the donor’s stated purpose after death when a valid document of gift exists with an explicit limitation. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. “If no research institution will accept the organ promptly, repurpose it for transplantation to avoid waste.” The statute does not authorize repurposing contrary to the donor’s express restriction merely because the specified purpose is not immediately practicable or acceptance is uncertain. Avoiding waste is not a statutory basis to contravene the donor’s limitation. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only legally permissible option on these facts is to honor the “research only” limitation and decline to transplant, as stated in option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4516076"}]}
