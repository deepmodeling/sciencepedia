{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The \"reasonable patient\" standard requires physicians to disclose risks that a patient would find significant, but what makes a risk \"significant\"? This practice provides a quantitative framework to explore this question, using a decision-theoretic index that balances a risk's probability, $p$, with its severity, $s$. By analyzing a case of a very low-probability but catastrophic outcome [@problem_id:4506041], you will see how the patient-centered standard gives great weight to the potential impact of a harm, a concept often at odds with a physician-centered standard focused on statistical frequency.", "problem": "A hospital adopts a transparent policy aimed at satisfying the duty of informed consent under both the reasonable physician and reasonable patient disclosure standards. Under the reasonable physician standard, disclosure follows professional custom: risks below a certain frequency are commonly omitted unless the specialty community deems them salient. Under the reasonable patient standard, disclosure is guided by whether a risk would be important to a reasonable patient’s decision. The hospital’s ethics committee decides to operationalize patient-side materiality through a decision-theoretic index that combines probability of harm and its severity, and sets a threshold of $T = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ for materiality.\n\nConsider a proposed elective spinal decompression procedure for an otherwise healthy adult with severe functional impairment due to nerve compression. The procedure carries a documented risk of permanent paralysis with probability $p$ described as $1$ in $20{,}000$ and a severity measure on a $0$ to $10$ scale of $s=10$ (with $10$ denoting catastrophic, life-altering harm). Assume the committee’s index is monotonic in both $p$ and $s$ and is grounded in rational decision-making principles in which expected harm escalates with both probability and severity.\n\nTask: Using the decision-theoretic materiality index adopted by the committee and the given values for $p$ and $s$, calculate the index value for this paralysis risk and state whether it meets the threshold $T$ for disclosure under the reasonable patient standard. Provide the numerical value of the index as a single decimal in scientific notation, rounded to four significant figures, and do not use a percentage sign. Then, justify, in brief, why an outcome with very high severity can warrant disclosure even when its probability is very low, and contrast this conclusion with the likely approach under the reasonable physician standard based on professional custom.", "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   **Disclosure Standards**: reasonable physician standard (based on professional custom) and reasonable patient standard (based on materiality to a reasonable patient).\n-   **Reasonable Physician Standard Detail**: Risks below a certain frequency are commonly omitted.\n-   **Reasonable Patient Standard Operationalization**: A decision-theoretic index combining probability of harm ($p$) and its severity ($s$).\n-   **Materiality Threshold**: $T = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n-   **Index Properties**: Monotonic in both $p$ and $s$; grounded in rational decision-making principles where expected harm escalates with both probability and severity.\n-   **Procedure Context**: Elective spinal decompression for an otherwise healthy adult.\n-   **Specific Risk**: Permanent paralysis.\n-   **Probability of Paralysis**: $p = 1$ in $20,000$.\n-   **Severity of Paralysis**: $s=10$ on a $0$ to $10$ scale, where $10$ is catastrophic.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem integrates concepts from medical law and decision theory to form a quantitative question.\n-   **Scientific Groundedness**: The problem is scientifically grounded. The \"reasonable physician\" and \"reasonable patient\" standards are foundational concepts in the legal doctrine of informed consent. The use of a decision-theoretic model based on probability and severity (utility/disutility) is a standard and rational approach to risk assessment and decision-making. The premises are factually sound and do not violate scientific or logical principles.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem asks for the calculation of an index value, but does not provide an explicit formula for the index, $I(p, s)$. However, it states that the index is \"grounded in rational decision-making principles in which expected harm escalates with both probability and severity\". In decision theory, the concept of \"expected harm\" has a canonical form: the product of the probability of an adverse event and a measure of its severity or disutility. Therefore, the simplest and most direct interpretation consistent with the provided principles is that the index $I$ is directly proportional to the product of $p$ and $s$. Assuming the simplest such model, $I = k \\cdot p \\cdot s$, and given that no scaling constant $k$ or normalization for the severity scale is mentioned, the most parsimonious model is $I = p \\cdot s$. The fact that this model yields an index value identical to the given threshold $T$ suggests this is the intended interpretation, resolving the potential ambiguity. Thus, the problem is sufficiently specified for a unique solution.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, precise language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe task is to calculate a decision-theoretic index for a specified risk and compare it to a materiality threshold, then discuss the implications for different disclosure standards.\n\nThe given probability of permanent paralysis is $p = 1$ in $20,000$. This can be written as a dimensionless number:\n$$p = \\frac{1}{20000} = 0.00005 = 5 \\times 10^{-5}$$\nThe severity of this outcome is given on a scale from $0$ to $10$ as $s=10$.\n\nThe problem states that the hospital's materiality index is grounded in rational decision-making principles of expected harm. The standard quantitative model for expected harm is the product of the probability of the harm and its severity. We therefore define the index $I$ as:\n$$I = p \\cdot s$$\n\nSubstituting the given values for $p$ and $s$:\n$$I = (5 \\times 10^{-5}) \\cdot 10 = 5 \\times 10^{-4}$$\nThe problem requires this value to be expressed in scientific notation rounded to four significant figures. This gives:\n$$I = 5.000 \\times 10^{-4}$$\n\nThe hospital committee has set a materiality threshold of $T = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}$. To determine if the risk is material under the reasonable patient standard as operationalized by the hospital, we compare the calculated index value $I$ with the threshold $T$.\n$$I = 5.000 \\times 10^{-4}$$\n$$T = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}$$\nSince $I = T$, the calculated index value meets the threshold for materiality ($I \\ge T$). Therefore, according to the hospital's policy for the reasonable patient standard, the risk of permanent paralysis must be disclosed.\n\nThe second part of the task requires a justification for why a high-severity, low-probability risk can be material, and a contrast with the reasonable physician standard.\n\nThe decision-theoretic index $I = p \\cdot s$ explicitly demonstrates how probability and severity interact. A very high severity, $s$, can yield a material risk (i.e., $I \\ge T$) even if the probability, $p$, is very low. In this case, the catastrophic nature of the outcome ($s=10$) acts as a powerful weighting factor, elevating the overall index value of a very rare event ($p=5 \\times 10^{-5}$) to the threshold of materiality. This reflects the core principle of the reasonable patient standard: a rational person may consider a risk of a devastating outcome, however improbable, to be a critical factor in their decision-making process.\n\nIn contrast, the reasonable physician standard is described as being based on professional custom, where \"risks below a certain frequency are commonly omitted\". A risk with a frequency of $1$ in $20,000$ is exceedingly low. It is highly probable that under a standard based purely on customary practice and statistical frequency, such a risk would not be routinely disclosed. While the problem allows for exceptions if the \"specialty community deems them salient\", the default approach would likely focus on the low probability and omit disclosure. The fundamental difference is that the reasonable physician standard, as described, is primarily frequency-driven, whereas the reasonable patient standard is impact-driven, giving significant weight to the magnitude of the potential harm on the patient's life.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.000 \\times 10^{-4}}$$", "id": "4506041"}, {"introduction": "A risk's materiality is not absolute; it is judged from the perspective of a reasonable person *in the patient's unique circumstances*. This exercise [@problem_id:4505925] presents a compelling scenario with two different patients to illustrate how the same medical risk can be material to one but not the other. Your task is to analyze how a patient's profession and personal priorities can transform a minor risk into a deal-breaker, and how this analysis is crucial for establishing the legal element of causation.", "problem": "In the law of medical negligence for informed consent, liability requires proof of duty, breach, causation, and damage. In the consent context, the duty of disclosure is framed by one of two standards: the reasonable physician standard, which measures disclosure against what a reasonably prudent physician would communicate, and the reasonable patient standard, which asks what a reasonably prudent patient in the patient’s position would find significant. A “material” risk under the reasonable patient standard is one to which a reasonable person in the patient’s position would likely attach significance when deciding whether to consent. Causation requires proof that, but for the failure to disclose, the patient would not have consented to the intervention or would have chosen a materially different course.\n\nConsider the following scenario involving laparoscopic cholecystectomy recommended for symptomatic gallstones. The operation is expected to substantially reduce the weekly risk of severe biliary pancreatitis from $r_{0} = 0.05$ per week to approximately $0$ once performed. Endotracheal intubation carries a risk $p = 0.01$ of transient hoarseness lasting $d = 2$ weeks. The surgeon does not disclose the hoarseness risk.\n\nTwo unrelated patients undergo the procedure:\n\n- Patient $A$ is an office accountant. They have no time-sensitive vocal commitments and report typical preferences for avoiding both pain and serious complications. The operation can be scheduled in $3$ days. An alternative is to delay surgery and manage medically for $t = 3$ weeks, during which the weekly risk of pancreatitis remains $r_{\\text{delay}} = 0.05$.\n\n- Patient $B$ is a professional singer who informs the surgeon of a non-refundable concert scheduled in $7$ days and states that hoarseness during the next $2$ weeks would cause cancellation, reputational harm, and financial loss. The same scheduling and delay options ($3$ days for immediate surgery; $t = 3$ weeks for delay at $r_{\\text{delay}} = 0.05$) apply.\n\nIn both cases, the undisclosed hoarseness risk materializes, and each patient sues for lack of informed consent. Assume the jurisdiction applies the reasonable patient standard for breach and the “but-for” test for causation (i.e., the plaintiff must show they would have declined or materially altered the timing or nature of consent if properly informed).\n\nWhich option best captures how the materiality threshold interacts with causation in these facts?\n\nA. For Patient $A$, the hoarseness risk at $p = 0.01$ lasting $d = 2$ weeks is non-material relative to the $r_{0} = 0.05$ weekly pancreatitis risk, so the undisclosed risk is unlikely to satisfy the but-for test; for Patient $B$, the surgeon’s knowledge of the concert elevates the hoarseness risk to material from the patient’s position, and it is plausible that, but for disclosure, $B$ would have postponed for $t = 3$ weeks, satisfying causation.\n\nB. But-for causation is automatically satisfied for both patients whenever an undisclosed risk occurs, because, absent consent, the injury would not have happened.\n\nC. Under the reasonable physician standard, the hoarseness risk is non-material, so there is no breach and therefore causation fails for both patients, regardless of patient-specific circumstances.\n\nD. Because $p = 0.01$ is numerically smaller than $r_{\\text{delay}} = 0.05$, causation fails for both patients: a rational actor would never refuse or postpone the surgery if the undisclosed risk’s probability is lower than the alternative risk’s probability.", "solution": "This problem requires an analysis of legal principles of informed consent—specifically materiality and causation—applied to a quantitative medical risk scenario. The jurisdiction uses the \"reasonable patient standard\" for materiality and the \"but-for\" test for causation. The analysis must be performed for two distinct patients, Patient $A$ and Patient $B$.\n\n**1. General Principles of Analysis**\n\nThe legal framework provided has two key components:\n-   **Breach of Duty (Materiality)**: The problem defines a material risk under the reasonable patient standard as \"one to which a reasonable person in the patient’s position would likely attach significance when deciding whether to consent.\" This standard is patient-centric and considers the specific circumstances of the individual.\n-   **Causation (\"But-For\" Test)**: The plaintiff must prove that, \"but for the failure to disclose, the patient would not have consented to the intervention or would have chosen a materially different course.\" This means we must evaluate if a reasonable patient, armed with the full information, would have made a different choice.\n\nThe core decision for both patients is whether to have surgery immediately or to delay for $t=3$ weeks. A rational analysis involves comparing the risks and benefits of these two options.\n\n-   **Option 1: Surgery Now** (in $3$ days). The benefit is the immediate elimination of the weekly pancreatitis risk ($r_0 = 0.05$). The undisclosed risk is a $p = 0.01$ probability of transient hoarseness lasting $d=2$ weeks.\n-   **Option 2: Delay for $t=3$ Weeks**. This avoids the immediate risk of surgery-induced hoarseness but exposes the patient to the weekly pancreatitis risk of $r_{\\text{delay}} = 0.05$ for $3$ weeks. The cumulative probability of suffering at least one episode of pancreatitis during this delay is $1 - (1 - r_{\\text{delay}})^t = 1 - (1 - 0.05)^3 = 1 - (0.95)^3 = 1 - 0.857375 = 0.142625$, or approximately $14.3\\%$.\n\n**2. Analysis for Patient A (Office Accountant)**\n\n-   **Materiality**: Patient $A$ is an accountant with no special vocal needs. For this patient, the \"position\" is that of a typical person. The choice, if properly informed, would be between:\n    -   A $p=0.01$ ($1\\%$) chance of a minor, temporary inconvenience (hoarseness for $d=2$ weeks).\n    -   A $\\approx 14.3\\%$ chance of \"severe biliary pancreatitis,\" a life-threatening condition, by delaying.\n    A reasonable person in Patient $A$'s position would weigh the small risk of a minor problem against the much larger risk of a severe medical complication. The pancreatitis risk is over an order of magnitude higher in probability ($0.143$ vs. $0.01$) and vastly more severe in consequence. Therefore, a reasonable person in this position would be highly unlikely to attach significance to the hoarseness risk when making the decision. The risk is **non-material** for Patient $A$.\n\n-   **Causation**: Since the risk is non-material, a reasonable patient in $A$'s shoes would not have altered their decision if informed. Faced with the choice, they would have proceeded with the surgery to avoid the substantial risk of pancreatitis. Thus, the failure to disclose did not *cause* the patient to consent to a procedure they otherwise would have altered or refused. The but-for test **fails**.\n\n**3. Analysis for Patient B (Professional Singer)**\n\n-   **Materiality**: Patient $B$'s \"position\" is fundamentally different. She is a professional singer, and she has explicitly informed the surgeon of an imminent, high-stakes concert. For her, hoarseness is not a minor inconvenience; it signifies \"cancellation, reputational harm, and financial loss.\" The outcome's disutility is exceptionally high for this specific patient. The surgery is in $3$ days, the concert in $7$ days, and the hoarseness, if it occurs, would last $2$ weeks ($14$ days), directly impacting the concert. A reasonable person in the position of a professional singer with this specific commitment would almost certainly attach significance to even a small ($p=0.01$) risk of an outcome that would jeopardize their livelihood and reputation. Therefore, the risk of hoarseness is **material** for Patient $B$. The surgeon's failure to disclose this risk constitutes a breach of duty.\n\n-   **Causation**: The but-for test asks if a reasonable patient in $B$'s position, knowing the $p=0.01$ risk of hoarseness, would have altered their choice. The choice is:\n    -   Surgery now, with a $1\\%$ chance of career/financial damage.\n    -   Delay for $3$ weeks, accepting a $\\approx 14.3\\%$ risk of severe pancreatitis to guarantee her ability to perform at the concert.\n    This is a difficult trade-off between a medical risk and a professional/financial risk. It is entirely plausible that a reasonable person in Patient $B$'s specific, known circumstances would choose to accept the pancreatitis risk for a short period to protect her career. She could opt to delay the surgery until after the concert. This constitutes \"choosing a materially different course\" (i.e., altering the timing of the consent). Because a reasonable patient in her position might have made this choice, the but-for causation test is **satisfied**.\n\n**4. Option-by-Option Evaluation**\n\n**A. For Patient $A$, the hoarseness risk at $p = 0.01$ lasting $d = 2$ weeks is non-material relative to the $r_{0} = 0.05$ weekly pancreatitis risk, so the undisclosed risk is unlikely to satisfy the but-for test; for Patient $B$, the surgeon’s knowledge of the concert elevates the hoarseness risk to material from the patient’s position, and it is plausible that, but for disclosure, $B$ would have postponed for $t = 3$ weeks, satisfying causation.**\nThis option accurately reflects the analysis above. It correctly identifies the risk as non-material for Patient $A$ due to the high competing risk of pancreatitis, leading to a failure of causation. It also correctly identifies the risk as material for Patient $B$ due to her unique professional circumstances, making it plausible that she would have altered the timing of her surgery, thus satisfying causation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. But-for causation is automatically satisfied for both patients whenever an undisclosed risk occurs, because, absent consent, the injury would not have happened.**\nThis misstates the but-for test for informed consent. The test is not whether the procedure caused the injury, but whether the *lack of information* caused the *consent* to be given in a way it otherwise would not have been. As shown with Patient $A$, even with full information, a reasonable patient would likely still have consented in the same manner. Therefore, causation is not automatic.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Under the reasonable physician standard, the hoarseness risk is non-material, so there is no breach and therefore causation fails for both patients, regardless of patient-specific circumstances.**\nThis option fails for two reasons. First, it applies the \"reasonable physician standard,\" whereas the problem explicitly mandates the \"reasonable patient standard.\" Second, it ignores the patient-specific circumstances, which are the entire crux of the reasonable patient standard. The outcomes for Patient $A$ and Patient $B$ are different precisely because of their different circumstances.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Because $p = 0.01$ is numerically smaller than $r_{\\text{delay}} = 0.05$, causation fails for both patients: a rational actor would never refuse or postpone the surgery if the undisclosed risk’s probability is lower than the alternative risk’s probability.**\nThis reasoning is flawed. First, it incorrectly compares a one-time probability ($p=0.01$) with a weekly rate ($r_{\\text{delay}}=0.05$). The correct comparison is with the cumulative risk over $t=3$ weeks, which is $\\approx 14.3\\%$. More fundamentally, it ignores the utility (or severity) of the outcomes. Rational decision-making weighs both probability and utility. For Patient $B$, the disutility of hoarseness is immense, so even a low-probability risk can be decision-altering.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4505925"}, {"introduction": "When a physician fails to secure proper consent, what is the resulting legal claim?

During the preoperative visit, Dr. Nguyen provides a brief overview of “routine risks like bleeding and infection” and obtains a signed consent that lists “bilateral reduction mammoplasty.” Dr. Nguyen does not disclose two risks with associated probabilities that are documented in the clinic’s evidence-based counseling checklist: a risk of nipple-areolar complex ischemia leading to partial or total loss of nipple sensation of approximately $10\\%$, and a risk of requiring intraoperative conversion to a free-nipple graft technique if perfusion is compromised of approximately $2\\%$, which entails a materially different recovery and permanently eliminates breastfeeding capacity. Dr. Nguyen’s local professional society guideline shows that about $85\\%$ of board-certified plastic surgeons in the region disclose these risks preoperatively as part of routine informed consent for reduction mammoplasty.\n\nIntraoperatively, after beginning a standard pedicled technique, Dr. Nguyen judges that perfusion is marginal and converts to a free-nipple graft technique without pausing to obtain intraoperative consent and without documented emergent circumstances. In addition, Dr. Nguyen performs a minor excision of a benign-appearing accessory axillary breast tissue “for better contour,” not mentioned preoperatively and not included in the written consent. Postoperatively, Patient A experiences complete loss of nipple sensation and is informed that breastfeeding will not be possible due to the graft technique; she also notes scar and contour changes in the axillary area where the accessory tissue was excised.\n\nPatient A sues, alleging that her apparent consent was invalid due to inadequate disclosure and mischaracterization of the procedure, and asserts both battery and negligence claims. The jurisdiction recognizes two standards for disclosure in informed consent: the “reasonable physician” standard (disclosure consistent with what a reasonably prudent physician in the same specialty would disclose) and the “reasonable patient” standard (disclosure of all material information a reasonably prudent patient would consider significant to the decision, including nature of the procedure, alternatives, and material risks). The jurisdiction’s battery doctrine defines battery as an intentional, unpermitted touching, including performing a substantially different procedure or exceeding the scope of consent; the negligence doctrine for informed consent requires proof of a duty to disclose under the applicable standard, breach, causation (that a reasonably prudent patient would have declined if properly informed), and damages.\n\nWhich option best characterizes the most defensible allocation of Patient A’s claims between battery and negligence, and the applicable disclosure standard(s), given the facts above?\n\nA.

The medical procedures (reduction mammoplasty, free-nipple graft), risks (ischemia, sensation loss), and anatomical structures (nipple-areolar complex, accessory axillary breast tissue) are all standard and factually correct within medicine. The legal doctrines provided (battery, negligence, reasonable physician standard, reasonable patient standard) are standard concepts in tort law and medical malpractice. The problem does not violate any scientific or legal principles.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a set of facts and a set of rules (legal doctrines) and asks for the logical application of those rules to the facts to determine the most defensible legal characterization.

There are no contradictory facts or legal definitions.\n-   **Topic Relevance**: The problem squarely addresses the topic of \"standards for disclosure: reasonable physician vs.reasonable patient\" within the field of \"medical law,\" which is explicitly permitted.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a logically structured problem requiring the application of provided definitions to a set of facts. I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis requires dissecting Patient A's claims by mapping Dr. Nguyen's specific actions to the provided legal doctrines of battery and negligence.\n\n**Analysis of Battery Claim:**\nThe jurisdiction's battery doctrine applies to \"intentional, unpermitted touching, including performing a substantially different procedure or exceeding the scope of consent.\" The intent required is the intent to perform the touching, not an intent to harm.\n\n1.  **Excision of accessory axillary breast tissue**: This procedure was \"not mentioned preoperatively and not included in the written consent.\" The consent was for \"bilateral reduction mammoplasty.\" The excision of axillary tissue, even if for a subjectively \"better contour,\" is a distinct procedure. This action clearly constitutes \"exceeding the scope of consent.\" Therefore, it is a classic case of medical battery.\n\n2.  **Intraoperative conversion to a free-nipple graft technique**: The problem states this technique \"entails a materially different recovery and permanently eliminates breastfeeding capacity.\" This qualifies it as a \"substantially different procedure\" from the standard pedicled technique the patient implicitly consented to. The conversion was performed \"without pausing to obtain intraoperative consent and without documented emergent circumstances.\" The absence of an emergency negates any defense of implied consent for life-saving measures. This action, therefore, also constitutes a battery.\n\n**Analysis of Negligence Claim (Informed Consent):**\nA negligence claim for lack of informed consent is appropriate for cases where consent for the procedure was given, but the consent was not \"informed\" because the physician failed to disclose material information. This claim requires analyzing the duty to disclose, breach, causation, and damages. The core of the analysis is the breach of the duty to disclose.\n\n1.  **Nondisclosure of Risks**: Dr. Nguyen failed to disclose the $10\\%$ risk of nipple sensation loss and the $2\\%$ risk of conversion to a free-nipple graft. The disclosure of \"routine risks like bleeding and infection\" is insufficient. The issue is whether this nondisclosure breached a duty.\n\n2.  **Applicable Disclosure Standards**: The jurisdiction recognizes two standards. We must evaluate the nondisclosure against both.\n    -   **Reasonable Physician Standard**: This standard is based on professional custom. The problem states that \"$85\\%$ of board-certified plastic surgeons in the region disclose these risks.\" An $85\\%$ prevalence strongly suggests that this disclosure is the standard of care. A physician who is part of the $15\\%$ minority that does not disclose would likely be found to have breached the duty of care as defined by what a \"reasonably prudent\" physician would do. Therefore, a breach of this standard is highly probable.\n    -   **Reasonable Patient Standard**: This standard focuses on materiality to the patient. Would a \"reasonably prudent patient\" find this information significant? A $10\\%$ risk of permanent loss of nipple sensation is a significant outcome that could influence a patient's decision. A $2\\%$ risk of a \"materially different\" procedure that \"permanently eliminates breastfeeding capacity\" is also undoubtedly material, as the ability to breastfeed is a major life consideration for many patients. The nondisclosure of these risks is a clear breach of the reasonable patient standard.\n\n3.  **Causation and Damages**: Patient A suffered the exact harms she was not warned about (loss of sensation, consequences of the free-nipple graft), and she incurred an additional unconsented procedure (axillary excision). For the negligence claim, she would need to prove that a reasonable patient in her position would have declined the surgery if properly informed of the risks. Given the materiality of the risks, this is a plausible argument. The harms themselves constitute the damages.\n\n**Conclusion of Analysis**:\n-   The unconsented-to procedures (axillary excision and conversion to free-nipple graft) are properly characterized as **battery**. They represent a total lack of consent for those specific touchings.\n-   The failure to disclose the risks of sensation loss and the potential for conversion is properly characterized as **negligence**. This concerns the quality of the consent obtained for the overall procedure, not a complete lack of consent.\n-   The negligence claim is strong under both the reasonable patient standard (due to the materiality of the risks) and the reasonable physician standard (due to the $85\\%$ professional custom).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. All claims sound in battery because any failure to disclose risks nullifies consent; no negligence claim lies where the patient signed a written consent listing the procedure.**\nThis option incorrectly conflates the torts of battery and negligence. Modern medical malpractice law distinguishes between performing an unconsented procedure (battery) and failing to provide adequate information for a consented procedure (negligence). The statement that \"any failure to disclose risks nullifies consent\" is an oversimplification and legally inaccurate.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The unauthorized axillary tissue excision and the intraoperative conversion to a free-nipple graft without prior disclosure are battery because they exceed the scope and nature of consent; nondisclosure of the $10\\%$ nipple sensation loss risk and the $2\\%$ conversion risk sounds in negligence under the reasonable patient standard, and likely also under the reasonable physician standard given the $85\\%$ custom.**\nThis option accurately segregates the claims. It correctly identifies the axillary excision and the conversion to a different procedure as batteries for exceeding the scope and nature of consent. It correctly identifies the nondisclosure of risks as the basis for a negligence claim. Furthermore, it correctly analyzes the strength of the negligence claim under both the reasonable patient standard (materiality) and the reasonable physician standard (the $85\\%$ custom). This aligns perfectly with the derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. There is no battery because the free-nipple graft is within the surgeon’s technical discretion once surgery begins; nondisclosure cannot support negligence if at least one physician would have proceeded similarly, making the reasonable physician standard satisfied.**\nThis option contains two flawed legal interpretations. First, \"technical discretion\" does not permit a surgeon to perform a \"substantially different\" procedure without consent, especially when no emergency exists. Second, it mischaracterizes the reasonable physician standard. The standard is what a \"reasonably prudent\" physician would do, which is typically established by a majority or a respected body of the profession (here, $85\\%$), not by the existence of a small minority ($15\\%$) who might act differently.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Battery applies only if Dr. Nguyen intended to harm Patient A; absent intent to harm, both the undisclosed risks and the added axillary excision are analyzed solely as negligence, and disclosure adequacy is judged exclusively by professional custom regardless of patient values.**\nThis option is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, the intent for battery is the intent to make contact, not the intent to cause harm. Second, it wrongly dismisses the battery claim for the axillary excision. Third, it incorrectly states that disclosure is judged \"exclusively by professional custom\" (the reasonable physician standard), which contradicts the problem statement that the jurisdiction recognizes *both* standards, including the reasonable patient standard.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4505951"}]}
