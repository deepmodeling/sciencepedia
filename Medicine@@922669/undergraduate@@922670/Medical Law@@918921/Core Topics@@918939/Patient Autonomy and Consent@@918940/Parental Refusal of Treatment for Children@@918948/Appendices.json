It grounds a quantitative question in a realistic scenario from medical law. The interpretation of \"balance of probabilities\" as a probability greater than $0.5$ is a standard, correct formalization in legal theory and quantitative analysis. The provided probability value is realistic. No scientific principles are violated.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. The phrase \"more likely than not\" translates unambiguously into a mathematical inequality, which in turn defines a clear numerical threshold. The quantity to be calculated is explicitly defined. The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information for a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective language. It presents a clinical estimate and a legal standard, asking for a formal calculation based on their definitions. It avoids subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the instructions (e.g., incompleteness, contradiction, reliance on pseudoscience).

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires the calculation of an excess probability based on a given clinical estimate and a legal standard of proof.\n\nLet $P(\\text{harm})$ be the clinician's estimated probability of serious harm resulting from non-treatment. From the problem statement, we have:\n$$P(\\text{harm}) = 0.62$$\n\nThe legal evidentiary standard is the \"balance of probabilities,\" which is defined as \"more likely than not.\" For an event with probability $p$, the condition \"more likely than not\" is mathematically expressed as the inequality $p > 0.5$. The evidentiary threshold, which we denote as $p^{\\ast}$, is the boundary value for this inequality. Thus, the threshold is:\n$$p^{\\ast} = 0.5$$\n\nThe court would authorize treatment if the probability of serious harm exceeds this threshold, i.e., if $P(\\text{harm}) > p^{\\ast}$. In this case, $0.62 > 0.5$, so the condition is met.\n\nThe problem asks for the \"minimal quantitative indicator of threshold exceedance,\" which is defined as \"the excess probability of serious harm above that threshold.\" Let this quantity be denoted by $\\Delta P$. This value is the difference between the estimated probability and the threshold probability:\n$$\\Delta P = P(\\text{harm}) - p^{\\ast}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values into this equation:\n$$\\Delta P = 0.62 - 0.5$$\n$$\\Delta P = 0.12$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a dimensionless number rounded to four significant figures.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe primary task is to calculate the total probability of a child suffering \"serious harm\" within one month if insulin treatment and hospital care are refused. We will use the law of total probability.\n\nLet $H$ be the event that the child suffers serious harm (death or permanent injury) within one month.\nLet $DKA$ be the event that the child develops diabetic ketoacidosis within one month.\nLet $DKA^c$ be the complement event, i.e., the child does not develop DKA within one month.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n-   The probability of developing DKA within one month is $P(DKA) = 0.60$.\n-   The conditional probability of serious harm given that DKA occurs is $P(H | DKA) = 0.25$.\n-   The conditional probability of serious harm given that DKA does not occur is $P(H | DKA^c) = 0.02$.\n\nThe events $DKA$ and $DKA^c$ form a partition of the sample space, as within the one-month period, the child either develops DKA or does not. The law of total probability states that the total probability of an event $H$ can be found by summing its probabilities across the partitions.\nThe formula is:\n$$P(H) = P(H \\cap DKA) + P(H \\cap DKA^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can write this as:\n$$P(H) = P(H|DKA)P(DKA) + P(H|DKA^c)P(DKA^c)$$\n\nFirst, we must find the probability of the complement event, $DKA^c$.\n$$P(DKA^c) = 1 - P(DKA)$$\nSubstituting the given value for $P(DKA)$:\n$$P(DKA^c) = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$$\n\nNow, we can substitute all the known values into the law of total probability formula:\n$$P(H) = (0.25)(0.60) + (0.02)(0.40)$$\nPerforming the multiplication for each term:\n$$P(H) = 0.1500 + 0.0080$$\nSumming the terms gives the total probability of serious harm:\n$$P(H) = 0.1580$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.1580$ is already in this form.\n\nThe final step is to compare this computed risk to the harm threshold. The harm threshold policy states that intervention is justified if the risk of serious harm exceeds 10%. In terms of probability, this corresponds to a risk greater than $0.10$.\nWe must check if $P(H) > 0.10$.\nOur calculated risk is $P(H) = 0.1580$.\nComparing the two values:\n$$0.1580 > 0.10$$\nThe inequality is true. Therefore, the calculated one-month risk of serious harm, which is $15.8\\%$, exceeds the $10\\%$ harm threshold. Based on this calculation, the harm threshold for state intervention is met.

It requires a holistic comparison of potential futures. This advanced practice introduces a powerful method from decision theory to quantify the child’s best interests, integrating not just the probabilities of outcomes like survival or disability, but also their relative value or 'utility.' Calculating the expected utility provides a transparent and structured framework to support the most difficult clinical and legal judgments [@problem_id:4498205].", "problem": "A hospital ethics committee is asked to advise in a case involving a $7$-year-old child with a life-threatening infection whose parents refuse consent for an indicated course of intravenous antibiotics. The child does not have decision-making capacity. Clinicians submit probabilistic estimates of clinical outcomes under two options: proceed with treatment or respect non-treatment. An ethics modeler proposes to operationalize the legal “best interests” standard by aggregating outcome utilities weighted by their probabilities to approximate the child’s expected welfare. The committee adopts the following utility assignments: $U(\\text{survival})=1$, $U(\\text{severe disability})=0.3$, and $U(\\text{death})=0$. The multidisciplinary team provides the following outcome probability vectors: for treatment, $(0.9,\\,0.05,\\,0.05)$ corresponding to survival, severe disability, and death; for non-treatment, $(0.2,\\,0.1,\\,0.7)$ in the same order.\n\nStarting from first principles in medical law—namely, that in disputes over parental refusal for an incapacitated child, the child’s best interests are paramount and must be assessed holistically—derive an expression that captures the expected best-interests advantage of treatment over non-treatment by combining utilities and probabilities in a scientifically transparent manner. Then compute the numerical value of this net advantage, defined as $E[U\\,|\\,\\text{treatment}]-E[U\\,|\\,\\text{non-treatment}]$. Round your final numerical answer to four significant figures.

It is scientifically grounded in decision theory, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation. It presents a formalizable application of expected utility theory to a recognized medico-legal dilemma.\n\nThe first principle states that the child's best interests are paramount. The problem proposes to operationalize this standard by calculating the expected utility, or welfare, associated with two courses of action: treatment and non-treatment. The expected utility of a course of action, $A$, is defined as the sum of the utilities of all possible outcomes, each weighted by its probability of occurrence given that action. The general formula is:\n$$E[U|A] = \\sum_{i} U_i \\cdot P(i|A)$$\nwhere $U_i$ is the utility of outcome $i$ and $P(i|A)$ is the probability of outcome $i$ occurring given action $A$.\n\nLet the three possible outcomes be survival ($s$), severe disability ($d$), and death ($m$). The utilities assigned to these outcomes are given as:\n$U_s = U(\\text{survival}) = 1$\n$U_d = U(\\text{severe disability}) = 0.3$\n$U_m = U(\\text{death}) = 0$\n\nLet the action of administering treatment be denoted by $T$ and the action of non-treatment be denoted by $NT$.\n\nThe problem provides the probability vectors for the outcomes under each action.\nFor treatment ($T$), the probabilities are:\n$P(s|T) = 0.9$\n$P(d|T) = 0.05$\n$P(m|T) = 0.05$\nThe sum of these probabilities is $0.9 + 0.05 + 0.05 = 1$, confirming the vector is valid.\n\nFor non-treatment ($NT$), the probabilities are:\n$P(s|NT) = 0.2$\n$P(d|NT) = 0.1$\n$P(m|NT) = 0.7$\nThe sum of these probabilities is $0.2 + 0.1 + 0.7 = 1$, also confirming validity.\n\nUsing the formula for expected utility, we can calculate the expected utility for treatment, $E[U|T]$:\n$$E[U|T] = U_s \\cdot P(s|T) + U_d \\cdot P(d|T) + U_m \\cdot P(m|T)$$\nNext, we calculate the expected utility for non-treatment, $E[U|NT]$:\n$$E[U|NT] = U_s \\cdot P(s|NT) + U_d \\cdot P(d|NT) + U_m \\cdot P(m|NT)$$\n\nThe problem asks for an expression for the \"net advantage\" of treatment over non-treatment, which is defined as the difference in their expected utilities, $\\Delta E[U]$.\nThe expression is therefore:\n$$\\Delta E[U] = E[U|T] - E[U|NT]$$\nSubstituting the expanded forms, we derive the full expression:\n$$\\Delta E[U] = \\left( U_s P(s|T) + U_d P(d|T) + U_m P(m|T) \\right) - \\left( U_s P(s|NT) + U_d P(d|NT) + U_m P(m|NT) \\right)$$\nThis expression captures the expected best-interests advantage in a scientifically transparent manner by combining the assigned utilities and the estimated probabilities.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of this net advantage.\nFirst, for treatment:\n$$E[U|T] = (1)(0.9) + (0.3)(0.05) + (0)(0.05)$$\n$$E[U|T] = 0.9 + 0.015 + 0 = 0.915$$\nNext, for non-treatment:\n$$E[U|NT] = (1)(0.2) + (0.3)(0.1) + (0)(0.7)$$\n$$E[U|NT] = 0.2 + 0.03 + 0 = 0.23$$\nThe net advantage is the difference between these two values:\n$$\\Delta E[U] = 0.915 - 0.23 = 0.685$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, the value is $0.6850$. This is a dimensionless quantity as utility is dimensionless.\n\nBased on this computation, the option that maximizes the child's expected best interests is treatment, as its expected utility ($0.915$) is substantially higher than that of non-treatment ($0.23$). The positive net advantage of $0.6850$ quantifies this benefit.\n\nIn legal terms, this finding is highly significant. The governing legal principle in such cases is the \"best interests of the child\" standard. In common law jurisdictions, the doctrine of *parens patriae* grants the state the authority to intervene to protect individuals, like minors, who are unable to protect themselves. While parental rights are respected, they are not absolute and can be overridden if a parental decision poses a significant risk of harm to the child. The quantitative analysis provides a rigorous, objective, and transparent demonstration that the parental refusal of treatment leads to a demonstrably worse outcome for the child, based on the probabilities and utilities accepted by the committee. The large, positive value of the net advantage provides strong evidence that respecting the parental refusal would be contrary to the child's best interests. This evidence would support an application to a court for an order to authorize treatment against the parents' wishes. The court would weigh this formal analysis as a key part of its holistic assessment of the child's best interests, likely finding that the prevention of death or severe disability warrants overriding the parental decision.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6850}$$", "id": "4498205"}]}
