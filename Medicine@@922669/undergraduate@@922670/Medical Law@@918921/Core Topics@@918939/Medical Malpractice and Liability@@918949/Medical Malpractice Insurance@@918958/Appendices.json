{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding a medical malpractice insurance policy begins with its most fundamental components: the limits of liability. This exercise focuses on the interplay between the per-claim limit, which caps the payout for a single incident, and the annual aggregate limit, which caps the total payout for a policy year. By walking through a sequence of claims where legal costs are \"inside the limits,\" you will gain a practical, step-by-step mastery of how a policy's coverage is applied and eventually exhausted, a core skill in assessing financial exposure. [@problem_id:4495869]", "problem": "A physician group purchases a medical professional liability (medical malpractice) policy with a per-claim limit of $1{,}000{,}000$ and an annual aggregate limit of $3{,}000{,}000$. All claims described below are covered and occur within the same policy period. There is no deductible or self-insured retention. Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses (ALAE) are “inside the limits,” meaning such expenses reduce the available limits of insurance for each claim and the annual aggregate.\n\nUsing only the core definitions of insurance contract limits and the legal effect of “inside the limits” cost handling, do the following: first, precisely define the per-claim limit and the aggregate limit in this context; second, determine the insured’s total out-of-pocket cost across the sequence of claims described below, taking into account that ALAE are inside the limits and that the insurer’s obligation is exhausted when either the applicable per-claim limit or the annual aggregate limit is reached.\n\nThe four claims are presented and paid in the following chronological order within the same policy year. For each claim, the indemnity demand is followed by its ALAE:\n- Claim $1$: indemnity $1.2$ million, ALAE $0.1$ million.\n- Claim $2$: indemnity $0.8$ million, ALAE $0.1$ million.\n- Claim $3$: indemnity $1.1$ million, ALAE $0.15$ million.\n- Claim $4$: indemnity $0.5$ million, ALAE $0.05$ million.\n\nCompute the insured’s total out-of-pocket cost (the sum of all amounts not paid by the insurer, including any indemnity and ALAE amounts above limits) across all four claims, respecting both the per-claim and aggregate limits and the fact that ALAE are inside the limits.

These principles are mathematically formalizable and represent real-world industry practice. The problem is fundamentally sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data (limits, claim amounts, ALAE, chronological order) and clear rules for how payments are constrained. The sequence of calculations is unambiguous, leading to a unique, stable, and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem uses precise, standard terminology from the insurance field. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A complete, reasoned solution can be constructed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires a precise definition of the insurance limits and a chronological calculation of the insurer's payments and the insured's out-of-pocket costs for a sequence of $4$ claims.\n\nFirst, the definitions are established as requested.\n- **Per-claim limit**: This is the maximum amount the insurer is obligated to pay for the sum of all covered losses and expenses arising from a single claim. In this problem, the total cost of a claim, which is the sum of the indemnity payment and the Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses (ALAE), is subject to this limit. Any amount of this sum exceeding the per-claim limit is the responsibility of the insured. The per-claim limit is given as $L_{claim} = \\$1{,}000{,}000$.\n- **Annual aggregate limit**: This is the maximum total amount the insurer is obligated to pay for all covered claims during a single policy year. Each payment made by the insurer for a claim reduces the available aggregate limit for subsequent claims in that year. Once the total payments reach this limit, the insurer has no further obligation to pay for any subsequent claims or remaining costs of current claims in that policy year. The annual aggregate limit is given as $L_{agg} = \\$3{,}000{,}000$.\n\nThe calculation proceeds by analyzing each claim in the specified chronological order. Let $I_i$ be the indemnity and $A_i$ be the ALAE for claim $i$. The total cost of claim $i$ is $C_i = I_i + A_i$, as ALAE are \"inside the limits.\" Let $P_i$ be the payment by the insurer for claim $i$, and $OOP_i$ be the out-of-pocket cost for the insured for claim $i$. The remaining aggregate limit before processing claim $i$ is denoted as $L_{agg\\_rem}^{(i-1)}$. Initially, $L_{agg\\_rem}^{(0)} = L_{agg} = \\$3{,}000{,}000$.\n\nThe insurer's payment for claim $i$, $P_i$, is determined by a two-step process. First, the total claim cost $C_i$ is subject to the per-claim limit, $L_{claim}$. The potentially payable amount, let's call it the capped claim amount $C'_{i}$, is $C'_{i} = \\min(C_i, L_{claim})$. Second, this capped amount is subject to the remaining aggregate limit, $L_{agg\\_rem}^{(i-1)}$. Thus, the actual insurer payment is $P_i = \\min(C'_{i}, L_{agg\\_rem}^{(i-1)})$. The insured's out-of-pocket cost is $OOP_i = C_i - P_i$. The aggregate limit is then updated: $L_{agg\\_rem}^{(i)} = L_{agg\\_rem}^{(i-1)} - P_i$.\n\n**Claim $1$:**\n- Indemnity $I_1 = \\$1{,}200{,}000$, ALAE $A_1 = \\$100{,}000$.\n- Total claim cost: $C_1 = I_1 + A_1 = \\$1{,}200{,}000 + \\$100{,}000 = \\$1{,}300{,}000$.\n- The cost $C_1$ exceeds the per-claim limit $L_{claim} = \\$1{,}000{,}000$.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to calculate the insured’s (the physician group's) total out-of-pocket payment for all claims occurring during the policy period. We first analyze the costs for a single claim and then aggregate them for all claims.\n\nLet's define the given variables symbolically:\n- Number of claims: $N = 5$\n- Indemnity per claim: $I_{claim} = 120000$\n- Defense costs per claim: $D_{claim} = 30000$\n- Per-claim Self-Insured Retention: $S_{SIR} = 100000$\n- Per-claim limit: $L_{claim} = 1000000$\n- Aggregate limit: $L_{agg} = 3000000$\n\nThe insured's total out-of-pocket payment, $P_{insured,total}$, is the sum of their payments across all claims. For each claim, the insured's payment, $P_{insured,claim}$, is the sum of their contribution to indemnity and defense costs.\n$$P_{insured,claim} = P_{insured,indemnity} + P_{insured,defense}$$\n\n1.  **Calculate the insured's payment for defense costs per claim ($P_{insured,defense}$)**\n    The policy states that the \"insurer’s duty to defend applies from dollar one\" and the \"SIR applies to indemnity only (not to defense costs).\" Definition (iv) further clarifies that defense costs under such an arrangement are paid by the insurer without application of the SIR. Therefore, the insurer pays the full amount of defense costs for each claim. The insured's out-of-pocket payment for defense costs is zero.\n    $$P_{insured,defense} = 0$$\n\n2.  **Calculate the insured's payment for indemnity per claim ($P_{insured,indemnity}$)**\n    The indemnity for a single claim is $I_{claim} = 120000$. The policy has a Self-Insured Retention (SIR) of $S_{SIR} = 100000$ that applies to indemnity. According to Definition (i), the SIR is the amount the insured must pay toward indemnity on a per-claim basis before the insurer's obligation begins.\n    The insured's indemnity payment for one claim is the lesser of the total indemnity for that claim and the SIR amount.\n    $$P_{insured,indemnity} = \\min(I_{claim}, S_{SIR})$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$P_{insured,indemnity} = \\min(120000, 100000) = 100000$$\n    So, for each claim, the insured pays $\\$100,000$ toward indemnity.\n\n3.  **Calculate the insured's total payment per claim ($P_{insured,claim}$)**\n    The total out-of-pocket payment for the insured for one claim is the sum of their indemnity and defense payments.\n    $$P_{insured,claim} = P_{insured,indemnity} + P_{insured,defense} = 100000 + 0 = 100000$$\n\n4.  **Calculate the insured's total payment for all claims ($P_{insured,total}$)**\n    There are $N = 5$ separate and identical claims. The total out-of-pocket payment for the insured is the payment per claim multiplied by the number of claims.\n    $$P_{insured,total} = N \\times P_{insured,claim}$$\n    $$P_{insured,total} = 5 \\times 100000 = 500000$$\n\n**Verification of Insurer's Limits:**\nTo ensure our calculation is final, we must verify that the insurer's payments do not exceed the policy limits, as this could potentially shift costs back to the insured (though typically not in this policy structure).\n- Insurer's indemnity payment per claim: This is the indemnity amount exceeding the SIR, $I_{claim} - S_{SIR} = 120000 - 100000 = 20000$. This amount is less than the per-claim limit $L_{claim} = 1000000$, so the per-claim limit is not reached.\n- Total indemnity paid by the insurer: This is the insurer's indemnity payment per claim multiplied by the number of claims: $5 \\times 20000 = 100000$. This amount is less than the aggregate limit $L_{agg} = 3000000$, so the aggregate limit is not reached.\n- Defense costs are \"outside the limits,\" so they do not erode the $L_{claim}$ or $L_{agg}$ values.\n\nThe policy limits are not breached, confirming that the insured's total out-of-pocket payment is correctly calculated based on the SIR.
