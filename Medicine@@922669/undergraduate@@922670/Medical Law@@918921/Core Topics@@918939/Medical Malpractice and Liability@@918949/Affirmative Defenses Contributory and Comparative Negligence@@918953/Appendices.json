The jury finds total compensatory damages of $D_{\\text{gross}} = \\$1,000,000$. The jury also finds that the patient was comparatively negligent by failing to follow discharge instructions, assigning the patient a fault share of $p = 0.51$.\n\nIn medical law, affirmative defenses of contributory and comparative negligence adjust a plaintiff’s recovery based on the plaintiff’s share of fault. The foundational principles are:\n\n- Under the traditional contributory negligence rule, any nonzero plaintiff fault bars recovery.\n\n- Under comparative negligence, fault is apportioned and recovery is adjusted accordingly. Two widely used comparative regimes are:\n  1. Pure comparative negligence.\n  2. Modified comparative negligence with a threshold bar at either $50\\%$ (the “$50\\%$ bar”) or $51\\%$ (the “$51\\%$ bar”).\n\nStarting only from these definitions, do the following:\n\n1. Derive the functional form of the net recoverable damages $D_{net}(p)$ under each of the three regimes: pure comparative negligence, modified comparative negligence with a $50\\%$ bar, and modified comparative negligence with a $51\\%$ bar.

It is self-contained, logically consistent, and grounded in established principles of tort law that can be formalized mathematically. All necessary definitions and data are provided, and the questions posed are well-defined and admit unique, meaningful solutions.\n\n### 1. Derivation of Net Recoverable Damages $D_{net}(p)$\n\nLet $D_{\\text{gross}}$ be the total compensatory damages awarded by the jury, and let $p$ be the fractional share of fault assigned to the plaintiff, where $p \\in [0, 1]$. The net recoverable damages, $D_{\\text{net}}(p)$, depend on the specific negligence regime. The foundational principle of comparative negligence is that the defendant is responsible for their share of the fault, which is $(1-p)$. Thus, the base recovery, before any bar is applied, is $D_{\\text{gross}}(1-p)$.\n\n**A. Pure Comparative Negligence**\n\nUnder this regime, the plaintiff's recovery is reduced proportionally to their share of fault, with no absolute bar to recovery. The defendant pays for their share of the damages regardless of the plaintiff's fault level. Therefore, the net recoverable damages are given by:\n$$D_{\\text{net, pure}}(p) = D_{\\text{gross}}(1-p) \\quad \\text{for } p \\in [0, 1]$$\nThis function is continuous over its domain. Recovery is possible as long as the plaintiff is not $100\\%$ at fault (i.e., $p < 1$).\n\n**B. Modified Comparative Negligence with a 50% Bar**\n\nThis regime imposes a threshold. A plaintiff is barred from any recovery if their fault is determined to be equal to or greater than a certain percentage. For the \"$50\\%$ bar\" rule, recovery is barred if the plaintiff's fault is $50\\%$ or more. Mathematically, this means if $p \\geq 0.5$, the recovery is $0$. Otherwise, the recovery is calculated as in the pure comparative system.\n\nThis translates to the following piecewise function:\n$$D_{\\text{net, 50%}}(p) = \\begin{cases} D_{\\text{gross}}(1-p) & \\text{if } 0 \\leq p < 0.5 \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } 0.5 \\leq p \\leq 1 \\end{cases}$$\n\n**C. Modified Comparative Negligence with a 51% Bar**\n\nSimilar to the $50\\%$ bar, the \"$51\\%$ bar\" rule bars recovery if the plaintiff's fault is $51\\%$ or greater. This means recovery is permitted if the plaintiff's fault is less than $51\\%$, including cases where fault is exactly $50\\%$. The threshold for being barred is $p = 0.51$.\n\nThis translates to the following piecewise function:\n$$D_{\\text{net, 51%}}(p) = \\begin{cases} D_{\\text{gross}}(1-p) & \\text{if } 0 \\leq p < 0.51 \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } 0.51 \\leq p \\leq 1 \\end{cases}$$\n\n### 2. Evaluation of $D_{net}$ for $p = 0.51$\n\nGiven $D_{\\text{gross}} = 1{,}000{,}000$ and the plaintiff's fault share $p = 0.51$.\n\n**A. Pure Comparative Negligence:**\n$$D_{\\text{net, pure}}(0.51) = 1{,}000{,}000 \\times (1 - 0.51) = 1{,}000{,}000 \\times 0.49 = 490{,}000$$\n\n**B. Modified Comparative Negligence (50% Bar):**\nAccording to the function derived in part 1B, recovery is barred for $p \\geq 0.5$. Since $p = 0.51 \\geq 0.5$, the condition for the bar is met.\n$$D_{\\text{net, 50%}}(0.51) = 0$$\n\n**C. Modified Comparative Negligence (51% Bar):**\nAccording to the function derived in part 1C, recovery is barred for $p \\geq 0.51$. Since $p = 0.51$, the condition for the bar is met.\n$$D_{\\text{net, 51%}}(0.51) = 0$$\n\n### 3. Discontinuity Analysis\n\nThe jump size $J$ at the threshold $p^{\\ast}$ is defined as the difference between the left-hand limit and the right-hand value of $D_{\\text{net}}(p)$ at $p=p^{\\ast}$:\n$$J = \\lim_{p \\to p^{\\ast -}} D_{\\text{net}}(p) - D_{\\text{net}}(p^{\\ast})$$\nFor both modified regimes, the function for $p < p^{\\ast}$ is $D_{\\text{gross}}(1-p)$, and the value at $p=p^{\\ast}$ is $0$.\n\nThe left-hand limit is:\n$$\\lim_{p \\to p^{\\ast -}} D_{\\text{net}}(p) = \\lim_{p \\to p^{\\ast -}} D_{\\text{gross}}(1-p) = D_{\\text{gross}}(1-p^{\\ast})$$\nThe value at the threshold is:\n$$D_{\\text{net}}(p^{\\ast}) = 0$$\nTherefore, the jump size $J$ is:\n$$J = D_{\\text{gross}}(1-p^{\\ast}) - 0 = D_{\\text{gross}}(1-p^{\\ast})$$\n\n**Legal-Policy Implications of the Discontinuity:**\n\nThe existence of a non-zero jump $J$ at the threshold $p^{\\ast}$ in modified comparative negligence regimes has significant legal-policy implications.\n\n*   **Fairness:** The discontinuity creates a \"cliff effect,\" which challenges the principle of proportionality. A plaintiff found to be infinitesimally less at fault than the threshold (e.g., $p = p^{\\ast} - \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is a very small positive number) recovers a substantial amount, approximately $D_{\\text{gross}}(1-p^{\\ast})$. In contrast, a plaintiff found to be exactly at fault $p = p^{\\ast}$ recovers nothing. This all-or-nothing outcome for a minuscule, often practically indistinguishable, difference in assessed fault can be viewed as arbitrary and inequitable.\n\n*   **Error Sensitivity in Fault Apportionment:** The apportionment of fault by a jury is an inherently subjective process, not a precise scientific measurement. The discontinuity makes the final monetary award extremely sensitive to small variations or errors in this subjective apportionment when the fault level is near the threshold $p^{\\ast}$. For example, in a $50\\%$ bar jurisdiction, the difference between a jury finding of $49.9\\%$ fault and $50.0\\%$ fault is the entire difference between a large recovery and zero recovery. This high sensitivity can amplify the impact of jury bias or misjudgment, undermining the stability and predictability of legal outcomes.\n\n*   **Litigation and Settlement Incentives:** The discontinuity fundamentally alters the incentives for litigation and settlement. For cases where the plaintiff's fault is likely to be near the threshold $p^{\\ast}$, the all-or-nothing nature of the potential outcome creates a high-stakes gamble. Plaintiffs are heavily incentivized to litigate aggressively, hoping to persuade the jury to assign a fault percentage just below the bar. Conversely, defendants have a powerful incentive to invest resources to push the fault assessment to or just over the threshold. This can hinder settlement negotiations, as both parties might prefer to risk trial rather than compromise. The plaintiff might reject a reasonable settlement offer, gambling on a full (though reduced) recovery, while the defendant might offer a very low settlement, gambling on a complete victory. The \"jump\" size $J$ quantifies the monetary value of this gamble, which can lead to more protracted, expensive litigation compared to the continuous and more predictable pure comparative negligence system.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n490000 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4471866"}, {"introduction": "Real-world medical malpractice cases often involve multiple layers of conduct, both pre-injury and post-injury.

The first is for a scenario under pure comparative negligence. The second is for a scenario under modified comparative negligence with an added failure to mitigate. The final answer to be reported is the result of the second calculation only.\n\n**Calculation 1: Pure Comparative Negligence**\n\nUnder the doctrine of pure comparative negligence, the plaintiff's recovery is reduced by their percentage of fault.\nThe gross damages are $D_{gross} = 900,000$.\nThe plaintiff's fault is $p = 0.35$.\nThe defendant's share of responsibility is therefore $(1-p) = (1 - 0.35) = 0.65$.\nThe net recoverable damages, $D_{net,1}$, are:\n$$D_{net,1} = D_{gross} \\times (1-p)$$\n$$D_{net,1} = 900,000 \\times (1 - 0.35) = 900,000 \\times 0.65 = 585,000$$\n\n**Calculation 2: Modified Comparative Negligence with Failure to Mitigate**\n\nThis scenario involves a sequence of two distinct adjustments. The order of operations is explicitly defined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we apply the doctrine of avoidable consequences (failure to mitigate). The problem states this removes the avoidable portion from the damages base *before* apportioning fault.\nThe amount of damages due to failure to mitigate is $10\\%$ of $D_{gross}$.\nLet this amount be $D_{mitigate}$.\n$$D_{mitigate} = 0.10 \\times D_{gross} = 0.10 \\times 900,000 = 90,000$$\nThis amount is subtracted from the gross damages to determine the adjusted damages base, $D_{adj}$, which is the portion of damages subject to apportionment of fault.\n$$D_{adj} = D_{gross} - D_{mitigate} = 900,000 - 90,000 = 810,000$$\n\nSecond, we apply the modified comparative negligence rule to this adjusted damages base, $D_{adj}$.\nThe rule includes a $50\\%$ bar. The plaintiff's recovery is zero if their fault $p$ is $50\\%$ or greater.\nThe plaintiff's fault is given as $p = 0.35$.\nWe check the condition: is $p \\ge 0.50$?\n$$0.35 < 0.50$$\nThe condition is not met. Therefore, the plaintiff is not barred from recovery.\n\nSince the plaintiff is not barred, their recovery is reduced in proportion to their fault. This proportional reduction is applied to the adjusted damages base, $D_{adj}$.\nThe net recoverable damages, $D_{net,2}$, are calculated by awarding the defendant-caused portion of the adjusted damages.\n$$D_{net,2} = D_{adj} \\times (1 - p)$$\n$$D_{net,2} = 810,000 \\times (1 - 0.35)$$\n$$D_{net,2} = 810,000 \\times 0.65$$\n$$D_{net,2} = 526,500$$\n\nThe final answer to be reported is $D_{net,2}$, the net recoverable damages under the second regime.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{526500}$$", "id": "4471871"}, {"introduction": "When harm results from the negligence of multiple actors—such as a hospital and a medical device manufacturer—the question of who pays for what becomes critical.

The validation process determined the problem to be well-posed, scientifically grounded in its legal-economic principles, and internally consistent.\n\nFirst, we formally define the variables provided in the problem statement:\n- The total compensatory damages found by the jury: $D_{gross} = \\$1,200,000$.\n- The apportioned fault for the hospital provider: $f_{provider} = 0.35$.\n- The apportioned fault for the medical device manufacturer: $f_{manufacturer} = 0.45$.\n- The apportioned fault for the patient: $f_{patient} = 0.20$.\n\nA necessary condition for a complete and logical apportionment of fault is that the sum of the fault shares equals unity. We verify this condition:\n$$f_{provider} + f_{manufacturer} + f_{patient} = 0.35 + 0.45 + 0.20 = 1.00$$\nThe condition is satisfied, so the fault apportionment is consistent.\n\nNext, we apply the principle of **pure comparative negligence**. This doctrine dictates that a plaintiff's recoverable damages are reduced by their own percentage of fault. The patient is found to be $20\\%$ at fault for their own injuries. Therefore, the total gross damages of $\\$1,200,000$ must be reduced by this proportion. The patient's net recovery, which we denote as $R_{net}$, is the portion of the damages attributable to the other parties (the tortfeasors).\n\nThe calculation for the patient's net recovery is:\n$$R_{net} = D_{gross} \\times (1 - f_{patient})$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R_{net} = \\$1,200,000 \\times (1 - 0.20) = \\$1,200,000 \\times 0.80 = \\$960,000$$\nAlternatively, the net recovery is the sum of the portions of damages caused by the tortfeasors:\n$$R_{net} = D_{gross} \\times (f_{provider} + f_{manufacturer}) = \\$1,200,000 \\times (0.35 + 0.45) = \\$1,200,000 \\times 0.80 = \\$960,000$$\nBoth calculations yield the same result. The patient is entitled to recover a total of $\\$960,000$.\n\nNow, we apply the principle of **several-only liability**.

One defendant cannot be made to pay the share of another, even if the other defendant is unable to pay. This is distinct from Joint and Several Liability (JSL), where a plaintiff could recover the full judgment from any single defendant.\n\nThe payment obligation for the provider, $P_{provider}$, is their percentage of fault applied to the total gross damages:\n$$P_{provider} = D_{gross} \\times f_{provider}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P_{provider} = \\$1,200,000 \\times 0.35 = \\$420,000$$\n\nSimilarly, the payment obligation for the manufacturer, $P_{manufacturer}$, is their percentage of fault applied to the total gross damages:\n$$P_{manufacturer} = D_{gross} \\times f_{manufacturer}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P_{manufacturer} = \\$1,200,000 \\times 0.45 = \\$540,000$$\n\nAs a final consistency check, the sum of the individual payments made by the tortfeasors must equal the patient's total net recovery:\n$$P_{provider} + P_{manufacturer} = \\$420,000 + \\$540,000 = \\$960,000$$\nThis sum precisely matches the calculated net recovery, $R_{net}$, for the patient, confirming the logical and arithmetic integrity of the result.\n\nThe results are as follows:\n- The patient's net recovery is $\\$960,000$.\n- The provider's payment obligation is $\\$420,000$.\n- The manufacturer's payment obligation is $\\$540,000$.\nThe problem requires these three values to be presented in a single row vector.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 960000 & 420000 & 540000 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4471904"}]}
