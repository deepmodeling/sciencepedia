It is a straightforward application of arithmetic rules.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. The solution will proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nLet $p$ represent the probability of the lost chance, $D$ represent the full non-economic damages for the underlying injury, and $C$ represent the statutory cap on non-economic damages. The final recoverable amount will be denoted by $R$.\n\nThe values provided are:\n$$p = 0.40$$\n$$D = 2,000,000$$\n$$C = 500,000$$\n\nThe problem mandates a two-step procedure for calculating the recoverable amount.\n\nFirst, the full non-economic damages $D$ must be adjusted according to the \"lost chance\" doctrine. This requires scaling the damages by the probability of the lost chance, $p$. Let this pro-rated damage amount be $D_p$.\n$$D_p = p \\times D$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$D_p = 0.40 \\times 2,000,000$$\n$$D_p = 800,000$$\nThus, the calculated damages based on the lost chance are $800,000$ dollars.\n\nSecond, the statutory cap $C$ must be applied to this pro-rated amount $D_p$. A cap functions as an upper limit. Therefore, the final recoverable amount $R$ is the minimum of the pro-rated damages and the statutory cap. This can be expressed mathematically using the minimum function:\n$$R = \\min(D_p, C)$$\nSubstituting the calculated value of $D_p$ and the given value for $C$:\n$$R = \\min(800,000, 500,000)$$\nBy comparing the two values, it is clear that $500,000$ is less than $800,000$. Consequently, the recoverable amount is limited by the cap.\n$$R = 500,000$$\nThe final recoverable amount is $500,000$ dollars.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{500000}\n$$", "id": "4495510"}, {"introduction": "Building on the foundational mechanics, this next practice presents a more comprehensive and realistic challenge: calculating a total damages award from its constituent parts. Real-world malpractice awards are rarely simple; they often involve distinct categories of damages, each with its own set of rules and limitations [@problem_id:4479950]. This exercise requires you to calculate economic losses using financial principles, apply a statutory cap to non-economic damages, and navigate the complex rules governing punitive damages to assemble a complete and legally sound final award.", "problem": "A patient prevails in a medical malpractice action. In a jurisdiction that follows the compensatory principle in tort—namely, that damages should place the plaintiff as nearly as possible in the position the plaintiff would have occupied absent the tort—economic damages are measured by the present value of the loss of earning capacity, and non-economic damages compensate for pain and suffering but are subject to statutory caps. Punitive damages, which are designed to punish and deter egregious misconduct rather than to compensate, are constrained by both due process considerations and statutory caps.\n\nAssume the following facts:\n- Before the malpractice, the plaintiff’s annual earning capacity was $\\$90{,}000$, with no expected real growth, for the next $20$ years, paid at the end of each year.\n- Because of the malpractice, the plaintiff’s post-injury annual earning capacity is reduced to $\\$40{,}000$ for those same $20$ end-of-year periods.\n- Courts in this jurisdiction discount future economic losses to present value using a real annual discount rate of $r=0.02$.\n- The jury finds non-economic damages of $\\$600{,}000$, but the jurisdiction caps non-economic damages at $\\$350{,}000$.\n- The jury also assesses punitive damages of $\\$1{,}500{,}000$, but a statute limits punitive damages to not more than $3$ times total compensatory damages and, in any event, not more than $\\$750{,}000$. The recoverable punitive damages are the minimum of the jury’s punitive award and the statutory limits.\n\nUsing only these facts and the foundational principles that (i) economic damages equal the present value of the incremental loss attributable to malpractice, defined as the difference between pre-injury and post-injury earning capacity, (ii) the time value of money requires discounting each future loss by the factor $(1+r)^{t}$ at time $t$, and (iii) statutory caps limit recoverable non-economic and punitive damages as stated, compute the total damages award (economic plus capped non-economic plus capped punitive).

It provides a complete set of data and specifies a clear, unambiguous set of rules for calculating the final value. The core of the problem is a standard present value calculation for an annuity, combined with a set of conditional rules for applying statutory caps. These concepts are fundamental in finance and economics. The problem does not violate any principles of mathematics or logic, is free of subjective claims, and contains no contradictory or incomplete information. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe total damages award is the sum of three components: (1) economic damages, (2) recoverable non-economic damages, and (3) recoverable punitive damages. Each component is calculated in sequence.\n\n1.  **Economic Damages**\n    The annual loss of earning capacity, $L$, is the difference between the pre-injury and post-injury annual capacities.\n    $$\n    L = \\$90,000 - \\$40,000 = \\$50,000\n    $$\n    This loss constitutes an ordinary annuity of $\\$50,000$ per year for a term of $T=20$ years. The economic damages are the present value ($PV_{econ}$) of this annuity, discounted at the real annual rate of $r=0.02$. The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is:\n    $$\n    PV_{econ} = L \\left( \\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-T}}{r} \\right)\n    $$\n    Substituting the given values into the formula:\n    $$\n    PV_{econ} = \\$50,000 \\left( \\frac{1 - (1+0.02)^{-20}}{0.02} \\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    PV_{econ} = \\$50,000 \\left( \\frac{1 - (1.02)^{-20}}{0.02} \\right)\n    $$\n    Calculation of the discount factor yields $(1.02)^{-20} \\approx 0.67297133$.\n    $$\n    PV_{econ} \\approx \\$50,000 \\left( \\frac{1 - 0.67297133}{0.02} \\right) = \\$50,000 \\left( \\frac{0.32702867}{0.02} \\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    PV_{econ} \\approx \\$50,000 \\times 16.3514335 = \\$817,571.675\n    $$\n\n2.  **Recoverable Non-Economic Damages**\n    The jury found non-economic damages of $\\$600,000$. However, a statutory cap limits this category of damages to $\\$350,000$. The recoverable amount, $D_{non-econ}$, is therefore the minimum of the jury's finding and the statutory cap.\n    $$\n    D_{non-econ} = \\min(\\$600,000, \\$350,000) = \\$350,000\n    $$\n\n3.  **Recoverable Punitive Damages**\n    The recoverable punitive damages, $D_{puni}$, are determined by finding the minimum of three values: (a) the jury's assessment, (b) a cap of $3$ times total compensatory damages, and (c) an absolute cap.\n    a. Jury's assessment: $\\$1,500,000$.\n    b. Absolute cap: $\\$750,000$.\n    c. Cap based on compensatory damages: This requires first calculating the total compensatory damages, $D_{comp}$, which is the sum of economic damages and recoverable non-economic damages.\n    $$\n    D_{comp} = PV_{econ} + D_{non-econ} \\approx \\$817,571.675 + \\$350,000 = \\$1,167,571.675\n    $$\n    The cap is $3$ times this amount:\n    $$\n    3 \\times D_{comp} \\approx 3 \\times \\$1,167,571.675 = \\$3,502,715.025\n    $$\n    Now, we find the minimum of the three potential values for punitive damages:\n    $$\n    D_{puni} = \\min(\\$1,500,000, \\$3,502,715.025, \\$750,000)\n    $$\n    The binding constraint is the absolute statutory cap.\n    $$\n    D_{puni} = \\$750,000\n    $$\n\n4.  **Total Damages Award**\n    The total award, $D_{total}$, is the sum of the calculated components.\n    $$\n    D_{total} = PV_{econ} + D_{non-econ} + D_{puni}\n    $$\n    $$\n    D_{total} \\approx \\$817,571.675 + \\$350,000 + \\$750,000 = \\$1,917,571.675\n    $$\n    The problem requires this final total to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant digits of $\\$1,917,571.675$ are $1, 9, 1, 7$. The fifth significant digit is $5$, so the fourth digit is rounded up.\n    $$\n    D_{total, rounded} = \\$1,918,000\n    $$\n    Expressing this in scientific notation gives $1.918 \\times 10^6$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.918 \\times 10^6}$$", "id": "4479950"}, {"introduction": "The consequences of medical malpractice caps extend beyond the calculation of an individual plaintiff's award; they create economic incentives that shape the entire legal landscape.
