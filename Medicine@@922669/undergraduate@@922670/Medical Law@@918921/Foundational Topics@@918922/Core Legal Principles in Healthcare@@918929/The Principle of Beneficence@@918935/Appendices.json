The best available evidence shows an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of the target outcome of $0.03$ and an absolute risk increase (ARI) of a serious adverse event of $0.01$. Assume independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials for each treated patient, where the probability that a single patient experiences a benefit attributable to treatment equals the absolute reduction in risk, and the probability that a single patient experiences a serious treatment-attributable harm equals the absolute increase in risk.\n\nUsing only foundational probability results and the definitions of absolute risk reduction and absolute risk increase, derive from first principles the expected number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one additional target outcome (Number Needed to Treat, $NNT$) and the expected number needed to cause one additional serious adverse event (Number Needed to Harm, $NNH$).

We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) and the Number Needed to Harm (NNH) from first principles. The scenario is modeled as a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli trials for each patient treated.\n\nLet us first derive the general formula for the expected number of trials required to achieve the first success in a sequence of i.i.d. Bernoulli trials. Let $X$ be a discrete random variable representing the number of the trial on which the first success occurs. Let $p$ be the probability of success on any single trial. The probability of failure is then $1-p$. The random variable $X$ follows a geometric distribution. For the first success to occur on the $k$-th trial, there must be $k-1$ failures followed by one success. The probability mass function of $X$ is given by:\n$$P(X=k) = (1-p)^{k-1}p, \\quad \\text{for } k = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$$\nThe expected value of $X$, denoted $E[X]$, is the sum of $k$ weighted by its probability $P(X=k)$ over all possible values of $k$:\n$$E[X] = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k \\cdot P(X=k) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k(1-p)^{k-1}p$$\nLet $q = 1-p$. The expression for the expected value becomes:\n$$E[X] = p \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k q^{k-1}$$\nTo evaluate this summation, we recall the formula for a geometric series, which converges for $|q| < 1$:\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} q^k = \\frac{1}{1-q}$$\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to $q$ yields:\n$$\\frac{d}{dq} \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} q^k \\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k q^{k-1} = \\frac{d}{dq} \\left( \\frac{1}{1-q} \\right) = \\frac{1}{(1-q)^2}$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $E[X]$:\n$$E[X] = p \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1-q)^2}$$\nNow, we substitute $q = 1-p$ back into the equation:\n$$E[X] = p \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1-(1-p))^2} = p \\cdot \\frac{1}{p^2} = \\frac{1}{p}$$\nThus, the expected number of trials until the first success is the reciprocal of the probability of success.\n\nWe now apply this general result to the specific cases of NNT and NNH.\n\n**1. Derivation and Calculation of NNT**\nThe Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is defined as the expected number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one additional target outcome. This corresponds to a \"success\" event in our probabilistic framework. The problem states that the probability of a single patient experiencing a benefit attributable to treatment is equal to the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR).\nTherefore, the probability of success is $p_{benefit} = ARR$.\nUsing our derived formula for the expected value:\n$$NNT = E[\\text{patients until one benefits}] = \\frac{1}{p_{benefit}} = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nGiven the value $ARR = 0.03$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.03} = \\frac{1}{3/100} = \\frac{100}{3}$$\n\n**2. Derivation and Calculation of NNH**\nSimilarly, the Number Needed to Harm (NNH) is the expected number of patients who need to be treated to cause one additional serious adverse event. This corresponds to a \"harm\" event. The problem states that the probability of a single patient experiencing a serious treatment-attributable harm is equal to the Absolute Risk Increase (ARI).\nTherefore, the probability of this event is $p_{harm} = ARI$.\nUsing the same derived formula:\n$$NNH = E[\\text{patients until one is harmed}] = \\frac{1}{p_{harm}} = \\frac{1}{ARI}$$\nGiven the value $ARI = 0.01$:\n$$NNH = \\frac{1}{0.01} = \\frac{1}{1/100} = 100$$\n\nThe final numeric values are $NNT = \\frac{100}{3}$ and $NNH = 100$.\n\n**Application to Informed Consent and Material Risk**\nThe principle of beneficence in medical law obligates a clinician to act in a patient's best interest by balancing the potential benefits of a treatment against its foreseeable harms. The derived figures, $NNT = \\frac{100}{3} \\approx 33.3$ and $NNH = 100$, provide a quantitative basis for this balance. They indicate that for every $100$ patients treated, one is expected to suffer a serious adverse event, while approximately three ($100 / (\\frac{100}{3}) = 3$) are expected to benefit by avoiding the target outcome. Under the legal doctrine of informed consent, a clinician must disclose all \"material risks\". A risk is material if a reasonable person in the patient's position would likely attach significance to it when deciding whether to undergo a procedure. The materiality of a risk is a function of both its probability and the severity of the potential harm. In this case, the ARI of $0.01$ (a $1$ in $100$ chance per patient) is associated with a \"serious adverse event.\" An NNH of $100$ makes this probability tangible. Given the severity of the outcome, such a risk is almost certainly material and must be disclosed to the patient. This disclosure, framed alongside the NNT, empowers the patient to weigh the likelihood of benefit against the likelihood of serious harm, thereby enabling an autonomous and informed decision that respects the ethical and legal obligations of beneficence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{100}{3} & 100 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4513069"}, {"introduction": "While the standard of care is typically set by a \"responsible body of medical opinion\" (the *Bolam* test), the law demands that such opinion be logically sound. This practice challenges you to step into the role of a judge and apply the critical qualification from *Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority*, which requires a medical opinion to withstand logical analysis.[@problem_id:4513121] Using published clinical trial data, you will dissect the reasoning behind a hospital's treatment policy to determine if it truly aligns with the principle of beneficence by properly balancing quantified risks and benefits.", "problem": "A hospital’s acute stroke unit has a written policy, endorsed by a “responsible body” of senior clinicians, to withhold intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) from patients aged $\\geq 75$ years who present with acute ischemic stroke within $3$ hours of symptom onset, even when standard contraindication screening is negative. The policy rationale is that “the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage is unacceptably high in older patients,” and that “non-treatment is therefore safer.” A specific patient aged $78$ years arrives $2.5$ hours from symptom onset with a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan showing no hemorrhage, normal coagulation studies, blood pressure within guideline thresholds, no recent surgery or anticoagulation, and intact decision-making capacity. Published randomized controlled trial data for patients treated within $3$ hours report an absolute increase in functional independence at $90$ days of approximately $13\\%$ (for example, independence rates rising from $26\\%$ without tPA to $39\\%$ with tPA), an increase in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage of approximately $5.4\\%$ to $6\\%$ (for example, from $0.6\\%$ without tPA to $6\\%$ with tPA), and no clear increase in overall $90$-day mortality. Assume these figures are applicable to this patient absent specific contraindications.\n\nStarting from the core definitions in medical law—namely, that the principle of beneficence requires clinicians to act so as to promote the patient’s welfare by reasonably maximizing expected clinical benefit and minimizing expected harm, the Bolam test requires that the clinician’s conduct be supported by a responsible body of medical opinion, and the refinement in Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority requires that such opinion must be capable of withstanding logical analysis—evaluate whether the hospital’s non-treatment practice is capable of withstanding logical analysis under Bolitho in light of the quantified risks and benefits. Which option best states the legally correct conclusion and the key reasoning?\n\nA. The non-treatment practice fails Bolitho because, given the published absolute benefit of approximately $13\\%$ in functional independence and the absolute harm of approximately $5.4\\%$ to $6\\%$ symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage without a corresponding rise in $90$-day mortality, a responsible body’s blanket refusal to treat solely due to age, absent contraindications, does not logically integrate the quantitative evidence required by beneficence; the opinion therefore cannot be considered reasonable under Bolam as qualified by Bolitho.\n\nB. The non-treatment practice passes Bolitho because the existence of any responsible body endorsing non-treatment suffices; logical analysis under Bolitho does not require engagement with quantitative evidence of risk and benefit.\n\nC. The non-treatment practice passes Bolitho because focusing on non-maleficence allows clinicians to prioritize avoidance of harm, and the increase in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage alone justifies withholding tPA irrespective of quantified functional benefits.\n\nD. The non-treatment practice passes Bolitho because age-based policies are per se lawful; justice in resource allocation can outweigh beneficence even where individual patients meet clinical criteria and published evidence shows net benefit.\n\nE. The non-treatment practice fails Bolitho only if a national guideline explicitly mandates tPA in all patients $\\geq 75$ years; without such a mandate, courts will not scrutinize the logic of competing medical opinions that decline treatment.", "solution": "The problem requires an evaluation of a hospital's non-treatment policy against the legal standard established in *Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority*, which qualifies the *Bolam* test.\n\nFirst, the relevant principles must be clearly understood based on the definitions provided in the problem statement.\n- The **principle of beneficence** mandates acting to promote the patient's welfare by reasonably maximizing expected clinical benefit and minimizing expected harm. This necessitates a balancing of risks and benefits.\n- The **Bolam test** states that a clinician's conduct is not negligent if it is supported by a responsible body of medical opinion. The problem stipulates that the hospital's policy is endorsed by such a body.\n- The refinement in **Bolitho** requires that the opinion of this responsible body must itself be \"capable of withstanding logical analysis.\" A court is not obliged to accept a medical opinion if, in its judgment, the opinion is not logically sound.\n\nThe hospital's policy is to withhold intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) from all patients aged $\\geq 75$ years, even in the absence of standard contraindications. The rationale provided is that \"the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage is unacceptably high in older patients,\" and that \"non-treatment is therefore safer.\"\n\nTo apply the *Bolitho* test, we must subject this rationale to logical analysis using the provided quantitative evidence. The evidence, derived from randomized controlled trials, is as follows:\n- **Benefit of tPA:** An absolute increase in functional independence at $90$ days of approximately $13\\%$. This is a substantial, positive outcome. For every $100$ patients treated, $13$ more will achieve functional independence than would have without treatment.\n- **Harm of tPA:** An increase in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) of approximately $5.4\\%$ to $6\\%$. Specifically, the risk rises from a baseline of about $0.6\\%$ to about $6\\%$ with treatment. This is a serious, negative outcome.\n- **Overall Mortality:** No clear increase in overall $90$-day mortality. This is a critical piece of information. It implies that while tPA causes some fatal sICH events, it prevents a similar number of deaths from other stroke-related causes (e.g., complications of severe disability), resulting in a neutral effect on survival at $90$ days.\n\nNow, we must logically analyze the policy's rationale: \"non-treatment is therefore safer.\"\nThe term \"safer\" must be evaluated in the context of all relevant outcomes, as required by the principle of beneficence (balancing benefits and harms).\n1. The policy's rationale focuses exclusively on the increased risk of sICH (from $\\approx 0.6\\%$ to $\\approx 6\\%$). In this narrow respect, non-treatment is indeed \"safer.\"\n2. However, the rationale completely ignores the substantial benefit: a $13\\%$ absolute increase in the chance of being functionally independent. With respect to this outcome, treatment is far superior, and non-treatment is the far \"less safe\" option for the patient's future quality of life.\n3. Furthermore, the rationale implicitly suggests that the risk of sICH makes the treatment more dangerous overall, but the evidence on $90$-day mortality contradicts this. The data show no net increase in mortality, meaning the risk of death is comparable between treatment and non-treatment. The claim that non-treatment is globally \"safer\" is therefore not supported by the evidence on the most final of all outcomes.\n\nAn opinion or policy that fixates on a single harm while ignoring a significant countervailing benefit and the overall mortality data fails to perform the balanced risk-benefit analysis required by the principle of beneficence. The conclusion that \"non-treatment is therefore safer\" is a logical fallacy; it does not follow from a complete and rational consideration of the provided evidence. A blanket policy that prohibits treatment for an entire age group, precluding individualized assessment and discussion with a capacitous patient, is particularly vulnerable to a finding of being illogical, especially when the evidence suggests a net benefit for the population in question.\n\nTherefore, the opinion of the \"responsible body\" in this case is not capable of withstanding logical analysis. It fails the *Bolitho* test.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n\n**A. The non-treatment practice fails Bolitho because, given the published absolute benefit of approximately $13\\%$ in functional independence and the absolute harm of approximately $5.4\\%$ to $6\\%$ symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage without a corresponding rise in $90$-day mortality, a responsible body’s blanket refusal to treat solely due to age, absent contraindications, does not logically integrate the quantitative evidence required by beneficence; the opinion therefore cannot be considered reasonable under Bolam as qualified by Bolitho.**\nThis option correctly concludes that the practice fails the *Bolitho* test. It accurately identifies the logical flaw: the failure to weigh the significant benefit ($13\\%$ gain in independence) against the harm ($5.4\\%-6\\%$ increase in sICH) in the context of neutral mortality. It correctly links this failure to the principle of beneficence and properly frames the conclusion within the legal doctrine of *Bolam* as qualified by *Bolitho*.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The non-treatment practice passes Bolitho because the existence of any responsible body endorsing non-treatment suffices; logical analysis under Bolitho does not require engagement with quantitative evidence of risk and benefit.**\nThis is a direct contradiction of the *Bolitho* principle. The entire purpose of the *Bolitho* qualification is to allow courts to reject an opinion from a responsible body if its reasoning is flawed. Logical analysis of medical risk and benefit inherently requires engagement with the quantitative evidence.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The non-treatment practice passes Bolitho because focusing on non-maleficence allows clinicians to prioritize avoidance of harm, and the increase in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage alone justifies withholding tPA irrespective of quantified functional benefits.**\nThis misrepresents the ethical and legal standard. The problem defines beneficence as balancing benefit and harm, not simply avoiding harm (non-maleficence) at all costs. An opinion that considers harm \"irrespective of quantified functional benefits\" is by definition one-sided and illogical, and thus fails the *Bolitho* test.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The non-treatment practice passes Bolitho because age-based policies are per se lawful; justice in resource allocation can outweigh beneficence even where individual patients meet clinical criteria and published evidence shows net benefit.**\nAge-based policies are not *per se* lawful and can be discriminatory. More importantly, the stated rationale for the policy is clinical safety, not resource allocation. The *Bolitho* test assesses the logic of the actual opinion provided, not a hypothetical alternative justification. This option introduces an irrelevant consideration.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The non-treatment practice fails Bolitho only if a national guideline explicitly mandates tPA in all patients $\\geq 75$ years; without such a mandate, courts will not scrutinize the logic of competing medical opinions that decline treatment.**\nThis is an incorrect statement of the law. The *Bolitho* test gives courts the power to scrutinize the logic of a medical opinion even in the absence of, or in the presence of conflicting, national guidelines. The test is whether the opinion itself is logical, independent of its conformity with a specific guideline.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4513121"}, {"introduction": "Perhaps the most demanding test of the principle of beneficence occurs when scarce resources force physicians to make tragic choices between patients.

In medical law, the principle of beneficence requires decision-makers to act in ways that maximize expected health benefits and minimize harms for patients and the broader community, subject to legal duties of equal respect and non-discrimination. A standard, well-tested metric for health benefit is the Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY), which is the product of life expectancy and a health-related quality weight on the unit interval. In health policy analysis, expected benefit is commonly evaluated by the expected value principle: if a patient has survival probability $p$ conditional on receiving the intervention, and would accrue $q$ QALYs upon survival, then the expected QALYs attributable to the intervention for that patient is the expected value of benefit.\n\nYou are given the following ethically relevant and scientifically realistic facts:\n- Patient A: survival probability $0.7$ if ventilated; post-survival benefit $3$ QALYs.\n- Patient B: survival probability $0.5$ if ventilated; post-survival benefit $6$ QALYs.\n\nAssume that without the ventilator, neither patient is expected to survive to accrue any QALYs from this episode, so the ventilator’s expected benefit to each patient equals the expected QALYs computed from survival under ventilation.

It presents a solvable quantitative problem based on a clearly defined framework.\n\nThe core task is to determine the allocation of a single ventilator that maximizes the expected health benefit, measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), and then to compute the net societal benefit of this optimal allocation compared to the alternative. The guiding principle is beneficence, which is operationalized as maximizing expected QALYs.\n\nThe expected QALYs for a patient, denoted as $E$, is calculated using the expected value principle. Given a survival probability $p$ conditional on receiving an intervention and a post-survival benefit of $q$ QALYs, the expected QALYs are given by the product:\n$$E = p \\times q$$\nThe problem states that without the ventilator, the expected QALYs for both patients are $0$. Therefore, the expected benefit from the ventilator for each patient is equal to their expected QALYs if they receive it.\n\nLet's denote the survival probability and post-survival QALYs for Patient A as $p_A$ and $q_A$, respectively, and for Patient B as $p_B$ and $q_B$.\nFrom the problem statement, the given values are:\nFor Patient A:\n- Survival probability if ventilated: $p_A = 0.7$\n- Post-survival benefit: $q_A = 3$ QALYs\n\nFor Patient B:\n- Survival probability if ventilated: $p_B = 0.5$\n- Post-survival benefit: $q_B = 6$ QALYs\n\nWe can now compute the expected QALYs for each patient if they were to receive the ventilator.\n\nFor Patient A, the expected QALYs, $E_A$, are:\n$$E_A = p_A \\times q_A = 0.7 \\times 3 = 2.1 \\text{ QALYs}$$\n\nFor Patient B, the expected QALYs, $E_B$, are:\n$$E_B = p_B \\times q_B = 0.5 \\times 6 = 3.0 \\text{ QALYs}$$\n\nAccording to the principle of beneficence, the ethically preferable allocation is the one that maximizes the expected benefit. We must compare the two expected QALY values:\n$$E_A = 2.1$$\n$$E_B = 3.0$$\nSince $3.0 > 2.1$, we have $E_B > E_A$. Therefore, allocating the ventilator to Patient B yields a greater expected health benefit.
