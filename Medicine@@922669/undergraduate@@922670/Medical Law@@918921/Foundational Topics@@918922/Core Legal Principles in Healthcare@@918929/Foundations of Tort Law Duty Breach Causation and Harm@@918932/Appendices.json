This exercise [@problem_id:4485307] will allow you to apply this formula to a clinical scenario, honing your ability to dissect the critical element of breach in tort law.", "problem": "A hospital emergency department physician faces a patient with suspected sepsis. The standard of care imposes a duty to act reasonably to prevent foreseeable harm when such harm is causally linked to the physician’s conduct. In negligence analysis, breach occurs when a reasonable provider would have taken a precaution because the expected harm avoided that is causally attributable to the precaution exceeds the burden of taking that precaution. Assume that delaying intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics by $2$ hours increases the patient's mortality risk by $p=0.10$ relative to immediate administration, that the harm from mortality is valued using the value of a statistical life at $L = \\$3,000,000$, and that the burden (cost) of immediate administration is $B = \\$2,000$ (including drug cost, staffing, and potential adverse effects management). For purposes of this analysis, assume causation is satisfied in that the increased risk $p$ is attributable to the delay and the harm measure $L$ appropriately monetizes the relevant loss.\n\nUsing the foundations of tort law (duty, breach, causation, and harm) and the economic analysis of reasonable precautions, define the net expected benefit of the precaution as the difference between the expected harm avoided and the burden of the precaution, denoted by $\\Delta$. Compute $\\Delta$ in dollars. Express your final quantity in dollars. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the net expected benefit, $\\Delta$, of a precaution. The precaution is the immediate administration of antibiotics. The net expected benefit is defined as the difference between the expected harm avoided by taking the precaution and the burden of taking that precaution.\n\nFirst, we identify the components of the calculation based on the provided givens. The burden of the precaution, which includes costs of the drug, staffing, and managing potential side effects, is given as $B = \\$2,000$.\n\nNext, we calculate the expected harm avoided. This is the reduction in the expected value of the loss (mortality) that is achieved by taking the precaution. The problem states that delaying the precaution increases the mortality risk by $p$. Therefore, taking the precaution (administering antibiotics immediately) avoids this increase in risk. The value of the harm of mortality is given as $L = \\$3,000,000$.\n\nThe expected harm avoided, which we can denote as $E_{\\text{avoided}}$, is the product of the probability of harm that is avoided, $p = 0.10$, and the magnitude of that harm, $L$.\n$$E_{\\text{avoided}} = p \\times L$$\n$$E_{\\text{avoided}} = 0.10 \\times 3,000,000 = 300,000$$\nSo, the expected harm avoided is $\\$300,000$.\n\nThe problem defines the net expected benefit, $\\Delta$, as the difference between the expected harm avoided and the burden of the precaution.\n$$\\Delta = E_{\\text{avoided}} - B$$\nSubstituting the numerical values into this equation:\n$$\\Delta = \\$300,000 - \\$2,000$$\n$$\\Delta = \\$298,000$$\nThe net expected benefit of administering the antibiotics immediately is $\\$298,000$. According to the negligence standard described, since the expected harm avoided $(\\$300,000)$ exceeds the burden $(\\$2,000)$, a reasonable provider would take the precaution.

The \"loss-of-chance\" doctrine addresses this by redefining the legal injury not as the ultimate adverse outcome, but as the reduction in the probability of achieving a better one. This shifts the focus from an all-or-nothing \"but-for\" test to a proportional assessment of the harm caused by the negligent act. This problem [@problem_id:4485291] provides hands-on practice in calculating damages under this modern doctrine, which is crucial for understanding how courts provide remedies for patients whose chances of survival or recovery were diminished by negligence.", "problem": "A hospital patient presented to the emergency department with symptoms consistent with a condition for which timely intervention significantly affects survival. In a medical negligence action brought in a jurisdiction that recognizes loss-of-chance as an actionable harm and uses proportional valuation of the lost chance for damages, assume the following facts have been established by a preponderance of the evidence: the physician owed a duty of care and breached that duty by negligently delaying diagnosis. The patient later died.\n\nExpert testimony, accepted by the court, establishes that if the patient had been treated without negligent delay, the probability of surviving the condition would have been $0.60$. Because of the negligent delay, the probability of survival was reduced to $0.45$. The jury has determined that full wrongful-death damages for the complete loss of life in this case would be valued at $\\$2,000,000$.\n\nStarting from the foundational elements of tort law—duty, breach, causation, and harm—and the legal recognition that a lost chance of survival is itself a compensable harm measured proportionally to the chance lost, determine the recoverable damages for the lost chance under these facts. Express your final answer in dollars as an exact number (no rounding).", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of recoverable damages in a medical negligence case under the \"loss of chance\" doctrine. We begin by validating the problem's structure and premises.\n\nThe foundational elements of a tort action for negligence are:\n1.  A duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff.\n2.  A breach of that duty by the defendant.\n3.  Causation linking the breach to the harm.\n4.  Harm or damages suffered by the plaintiff.\n\nThe problem statement stipulates that duty and breach have been established. The central issue revolves around causation and the quantification of harm. In traditional tort law, causation often requires the plaintiff to prove that it was \"more likely than not\" (i.e., with a probability greater than $0.5$) that the defendant's negligence caused the ultimate negative outcome. In this case, the ultimate outcome is the patient's death. However, this standard is difficult to meet in medical cases where a patient already had a substantial risk of a negative outcome even with proper care.\n\nThe \"loss of chance\" doctrine, which the problem specifies is recognized in the governing jurisdiction, modifies the analysis of causation and harm. Under this doctrine, the legally cognizable harm is not the ultimate adverse outcome (death) itself, but rather the reduction in the probability of achieving a more favorable outcome (survival). The negligence is deemed to have caused this reduction in probability.\n\nThe problem provides the necessary data to quantify this harm using a \"proportional valuation\" method. Let us define the variables:\n\nLet $P_1$ be the probability of the patient's survival had there been no negligent delay in diagnosis. The problem states this is $P_1 = 0.60$.\nLet $P_2$ be the probability of the patient's survival given that the negligent delay occurred. The problem states this is $P_2 = 0.45$.\nLet $V$ be the full value of the patient's life, as determined by a jury for the purpose of calculating wrongful-death damages. This value is given as $V = \\$2,000,000$.\n\nThe loss of chance is the absolute reduction in the probability of survival due to the physician's negligence. We calculate this as the difference between the two probabilities:\n$$\n\\Delta P = P_1 - P_2\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Delta P = 0.60 - 0.45 = 0.15\n$$\nThis means the physician's negligence caused a $15\\%$ absolute reduction in the patient's chance of survival.\n\nThe doctrine of proportional valuation dictates that the recoverable damages, $D$, are calculated by multiplying the full value of the outcome ($V$) by the percentage of the chance lost ($\\Delta P$). This method compensates the plaintiff for the portion of their chance of survival that was taken away by the negligence.\n\nThe formula for the damages is:\n$$\nD = V \\times \\Delta P = V \\times (P_1 - P_2)\n$$\nWe substitute the given numerical values into this equation:\n$$\nD = 2,000,000 \\times (0.60 - 0.45)\n$$\n$$\nD = 2,000,000 \\times 0.15\n$$\n$$\nD = 300,000\n$$\nTherefore, the recoverable damages for the lost chance of survival are $\\$300,000$.

By working through this problem [@problem_id:4485233], you will learn how to calculate the plaintiff's net recovery, a fundamental skill in translating a legal finding of liability into a final monetary judgment.", "problem": "A patient is discharged from a hospital Emergency Department (ED) after a minor surgical procedure. The patient has a physician–patient relationship with the attending surgeon, which creates a legally recognized duty of care. The discharge includes instructions to take a prescribed antibiotic for $7$ days and to abstain from strenuous activity for $10$ days. The physician briefly reviews the instructions but does not confirm the patient’s comprehension, and the written instructions use technical terminology not reasonably understandable to a layperson.\n\nThree days later, the patient stops the antibiotic and resumes strenuous activity, leading to a preventable wound infection that requires readmission, a second procedure, and extended recovery. A jury finds the following in a jurisdiction that applies pure comparative negligence: the physician breached the duty of care by failing to provide discharge instructions with reasonable clarity and to confirm understanding, the breach was both the actual cause (under a but-for test) and proximate cause of the infection, and the patient suffered legally cognizable harm. The jury also finds that the patient’s noncompliance with instructions contributed to the harm and assigns the patient a fault allocation of $0.30$.\n\nTotal damages (including medical expenses and noneconomic losses), assuming all tort elements are satisfied, are assessed at $\\$1,000,000$.

Express the final answer as the exact dollar amount in dollars. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The resolution of this problem proceeds by applying the specified legal doctrine of pure comparative negligence to the given facts. The foundation of a negligence claim in tort law requires the plaintiff to establish four elements: duty, breach of duty, causation, and harm. The problem statement stipulates that a jury has already found all four elements satisfied in the case against the physician.\n\n1.  **Duty**: A physician–patient relationship existed, creating a legal duty of care.\n2.  **Breach**: The physician breached this duty by failing to provide reasonably clear discharge instructions and to confirm the patient's comprehension.\n3.  **Causation**: The jury found that the physician's breach was both the actual cause and proximate cause of the patient's harm.\n4.  **Harm**: The patient suffered legally cognizable damages, which the jury assessed at a total value.\n\nWith these elements established, the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages. The next step is to determine the amount of that recovery. The jurisdiction applies the rule of pure comparative negligence. This doctrine apportions financial responsibility according to each party's percentage of fault. A plaintiff's recovery is reduced by their own percentage of fault, but they are not barred from recovery even if their fault is substantial (e.g., greater than $50\\%$).\n\nLet $D$ represent the total damages assessed by the jury.\n$$D = \\$1,000,000$$\nLet $f_p$ represent the proportion of fault allocated to the plaintiff (the patient).\n$$f_p = 0.30$$\nThe defendant physician's share of fault, $f_d$, is the complement of the plaintiff's fault.\n$$f_d = 1 - f_p = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$$\nThe net recovery for the plaintiff, denoted by $R$, is calculated by multiplying the total damages $D$ by the defendant's share of the fault $f_d$.\n$$R = D \\times f_d$$\n$$R = \\$1,000,000 \\times 0.70 = \\$700,000$$\nTherefore, under the rule of pure comparative negligence, the plaintiff's total damage award of $\\$1,000,000$ is reduced by their $30\\%$ share of fault $(\\$300,000)$, resulting in a net recovery of $\\$700,000$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{700000}$$", "id": "4485233"}]}
