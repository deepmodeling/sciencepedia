The patient, who identifies as a Jehovah’s Witness, refuses transfusion of packed red blood cells despite an estimated near-term mortality risk without transfusion of approximately $30\\%$. The chart includes a prior written advance directive refusing blood products signed $6$ months earlier. The patient’s hemoglobin is reported as critically low, and the team anticipates that within $2$ hours the risk of cardiac ischemia will escalate substantially. The patient provides reasons for refusing blood grounded in religious doctrine and expresses understanding that death may result. The patient’s spouse is present, tearful, and asks the team to proceed with transfusion “to save them,” while the patient repeats the refusal. There is no court order and no prior adjudication of incompetence. The attending physician, aware of the historical evolution from medical paternalism toward patient autonomy, seeks to apply a clinical-legal assessment protocol that properly distinguishes legal competence from clinical decision-making capacity and aligns decisional ability with the right to refuse treatment.\n\nFrom the standpoint of core medical law principles (including bodily integrity, the doctrine of informed consent and refusal, the presumption of capacity, and the state’s parens patriae authority limited to persons lacking capacity), which protocol below most appropriately distinguishes legal competence from clinical capacity and operationalizes the right to refuse life-sustaining treatment in this scenario?\n\nA.

The clinical details (gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, risk of ischemia) are medically realistic. The legal principles cited (autonomy, informed consent, capacity, *parens patriae*) are foundational doctrines in this field. The scenario is a classic, well-documented ethical and legal dilemma. The problem is grounded in the established principles of its domain.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly formulated. It presents a detailed case and a set of explicit legal and ethical principles. The task is to select the one protocol from the options that best aligns with these principles. This structure permits a single best answer to be determined through logical application of the given principles.\n- **Objective:** The scenario is described using objective, factual language. The question asks for the protocol that *most appropriately* applies a specified set of principles, which is a question of correct application rather than subjective opinion.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a self-contained, consistent, and well-posed problem grounded in the established principles of medical law and ethics. It is free from the flaws listed in the validation checklist. Therefore, proceeding to a full solution is warranted.\n\n**Solution Derivation and Option Analysis**\n\nThe core of this problem rests on the legal and ethical principles governing the right of a patient to refuse medical treatment. The historical evolution mentioned in the problem is the shift from a paternalistic model (where the physician decides what is in the patient's \"best interest\") to an autonomy-based model (where the patient's own values and decisions are paramount, provided the patient has decision-making capacity).\n\n**Fundamental Principles:**\n1.  **Autonomy and Bodily Integrity:** A competent adult has a fundamental right to self-determination regarding their own body. This includes the right to refuse any medical intervention, including life-sustaining treatment.\n2.  **Informed Consent and Refusal:** For a refusal to be legally and ethically valid, it must be (a) informed, (b) voluntary, and (c) made by a person with decision-making capacity. The patient in this scenario appears to meet criteria (a) and (b): they have been informed of the risks, including death, and are making a choice free from legal coercion (a spouse's plea does not legally constitute coercion that vitiates consent). The central question is (c) capacity.\n3.  **Presumption of Capacity:** An adult is presumed to be competent and to possess decision-making capacity. The burden of proof falls on the party seeking to demonstrate that the patient lacks capacity. The patient's presentation as \"conscious, oriented, and speaking coherently\" strongly supports this initial presumption.\n4.  **Clinical vs. Legal Determination:** \"Capacity\" is a clinical determination, specific to the decision at hand and the time it is made. It is a functional assessment of the patient's ability to understand, appreciate, reason, and communicate a choice. \"Competence\" is a legal state, determined by a court, and is a more global assessment of a person's ability to manage their affairs. Clinical practice deals with assessing capacity; courts adjudicate competence.\n5.  **State Interest (*Parens Patriae*):** The state's interest in preserving life does not override the refusal of a capacitous adult. The *parens patriae* power is reserved for protecting individuals who are unable to make their own decisions (i.e., those who lack capacity).\n\nA correct protocol must operationalize these principles by focusing on a functional assessment of capacity, respecting the patient's decision if capacity is present, and treating only if capacity is absent.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n**A. Treat any refusal of a high-risk, potentially life-saving intervention as legally ineffective absent a prior court adjudication of competence; obtain an emergency transfusion under a generalized best interests standard while seeking judicial review, because the gravity of risk converts the refusal into a matter for the courts rather than clinical assessment.**\n- **Analysis:** This option is a direct regression to medical paternalism. It incorrectly equates a high-risk decision with a lack of capacity or competence. It violates the principle of autonomy by making a patient's refusal \"legally ineffective\" simply because the stakes are high. It improperly shifts a primary clinical responsibility (assessing capacity) to the courts as a default, which is inefficient and contrary to established law. The right to refuse holds even when the risk is death.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Begin with a presumption that the patient has capacity; perform a decision-specific, time-specific functional assessment of the patient’s ability to understand, retain, use and weigh information, and communicate a choice (without regard to the outcome the patient chooses); provide practicable supports to facilitate decision-making; if capacity is present with respect to transfusion, respect the refusal and document reasoning, alternatives discussed, and voluntariness; treat under necessity only if the patient lacks capacity or capacity cannot be assessed in time, and escalate to court only if there is a genuine dispute about capacity, coercion, or validity of the directive.**\n- **Analysis:** This protocol is a textbook implementation of modern medical-legal principles. It starts with the correct presumption of capacity. It accurately defines capacity as a functional, decision-specific, and time-specific clinical assessment. Critically, it separates the process of the decision from the outcome (\"without regard to the outcome the patient chooses\"), thereby protecting decisions based on unconventional values (such as religion). It correctly outlines the consequences: respect the refusal if capacity is present, and only treat under emergency doctrines if capacity is absent. It appropriately reserves judicial intervention for genuine, irresolvable disputes, which is its proper role. This protocol correctly distinguishes capacity from competence and aligns with the right to refuse treatment.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**C. Apply a “sliding-scale” threshold whereby the degree of decisional ability required increases with the stakes of the decision; for a refusal carrying approximately $30\\%$ mortality risk, require heightened rationality beyond ordinary understanding and appreciation; if the patient does not meet this elevated threshold, override the refusal and transfuse.**\n- **Analysis:** The \"sliding-scale\" concept is ethically controversial and legally tenuous. While clinicians may be more careful in their assessment for high-stakes decisions, formally instituting a higher standard of \"rationality\" is problematic. It opens the door for physicians to judge the patient's values and imposes a subjective standard that is inconsistent with the principle of autonomy. Legal standards for capacity do not typically require \"heightened rationality\"; they require a functional ability to understand, appreciate, and reason. A decision based on deeply held religious beliefs, while perhaps not \"rational\" from a purely secular medical perspective, does not in itself indicate a lack of capacity. This approach risks penalizing patients for their beliefs.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Determine incapacity based on diagnosis or cognitive screening (for example, set an intelligence quotient cutoff at $70$ or use psychiatric labeling) and, if such criteria are met, allow family members to override the refusal as substitute decision-makers; in the absence of such diagnostic indicators, treat the refusal as valid solely because the patient is an adult.**\n- **Analysis:** This protocol is doubly flawed. First, it relies on a status-based assessment (a diagnosis or IQ score) rather than a functional assessment of capacity. A person can have a low IQ or a psychiatric diagnosis and still possess capacity for a specific medical decision. Conversely, a person can lack capacity due to an acute illness (e.g., delirium) without having any such label. The assessment must be functional. Second, it incorrectly allows family members to override the patient based on this flawed assessment and incorrectly validates a refusal solely based on age in the absence of such indicators.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Require written reaffirmation of the advance directive witnessed within the last $24$ hours; if not available, presume lack of capacity when the spouse disagrees, and proceed with transfusion on the basis that family assent substitutes for clinical assessment in emergencies.**\n- **Analysis:** This option introduces arbitrary and legally unsupported bureaucratic hurdles. There is no legal requirement for an advance directive to be reaffirmed within $24$ hours. Furthermore, it makes two grave errors: it presumes incapacity based on a family member's disagreement, which directly contradicts the patient-centered model of care, and it allows family assent to substitute for a clinical assessment of capacity, which is legally improper when the patient is conscious and communicating their own wishes. The spouse's distress does not grant them legal authority to make decisions for a capacitous patient.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4487826"}, {"introduction": "Meaningful autonomy depends on having the right information, which led to the development of the doctrine of informed consent.

Under the physician-centered standard, the legal duty to disclose is set by what a responsible body of medical practitioners customarily discloses; under the patient-centered standard, a risk is material if a reasonable person in the patient’s position would likely attach significance to it when deciding whether to undergo the intervention.

It is a well-structured question in medical jurisprudence that requires logical analysis based on defined principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Principles**\n\nThe core of the problem requires distinguishing two legal standards for informed consent and defining the criteria for one of them.\n\n1.  **Physician-Centered Standard (Professional Standard):**\n    This standard defines the scope of a physician's duty to disclose based on the customs of the medical profession. The dispositive question is: What would a reasonable physician of similar training and experience have disclosed to a patient in this situation? The standard of care is set by the profession itself. Evidence in a legal case would consist primarily of expert testimony from other physicians affirming or denying that the nondisclosure conformed to accepted medical practice. This standard has been criticized for being paternalistic and prioritizing professional consensus over individual patient autonomy.\n\n2.  **Patient-Centered Standard (Material Risk Standard):**\n    This standard shifts the focus from the physician's practice to the patient's need for information. It defines the duty to disclose based on the \"materiality\" of a risk to a patient's decision-making process. The dispositive question is: What would a reasonable person, in the patient's position, need to know to make an informed and intelligent decision about the proposed treatment? This standard is designed to protect the patient's right to self-determination.\n\n3.  **Criteria for Materiality under the Patient-Centered Standard:**\n    The determination of whether a risk is \"material\" is not based on a single factor but is a multifactorial assessment. A court would consider what a reasonable person in the patient's position would likely deem significant. The key criteria are:\n    a.  **The gravity of the potential harm:** The severity of the consequence if the risk materializes. A risk of a catastrophic outcome (e.g., death, paralysis, a career-ending injury as in the scenario) can be material even if its probability is very low.\n    b.  **The likelihood of occurrence:** The statistical probability that the harm will occur. This is weighed against the severity. A high-probability risk of a minor issue may be less material than a low-probability risk of a grave one.\n    c.  **The availability of alternatives:** The existence, risks, and benefits of any alternative treatments, including the option of no treatment. The materiality of a risk associated with a proposed procedure is evaluated in the context of what other choices the patient has.\n    d.  **Patient-specific circumstances:** Any particularities of the patient (e.g., occupation, lifestyle, values, beliefs) that the physician knows or reasonably should know. The test is for a \"reasonable person *in the patient's position*.\" A fact known to the physician, such as the patient being a professional pianist, makes a risk to fine motor control in the hands exceptionally significant and therefore highly material for that specific patient's decision calculus.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Under the physician-centered standard, the legal duty to disclose is set by what a responsible body of medical practitioners customarily discloses; under the patient-centered standard, a risk is material if a reasonable person in the patient’s position would likely attach significance to it when deciding whether to undergo the intervention. Materiality turns on the gravity of the potential harm, the likelihood of its occurrence, the availability and comparative profiles of alternatives, and any particular vulnerabilities or values of the patient that the clinician knows or ought to know.**\n- This option correctly defines the physician-centered standard as being based on professional custom.\n- It correctly defines the patient-centered standard using the \"reasonable person in the patient’s position\" test.\n- It provides a comprehensive and accurate list of the criteria for materiality: gravity, likelihood, alternatives, and known patient-specific factors.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Under the physician-centered standard, hospital policy is the sole determinant of disclosure duties; under the patient-centered standard, the clinician must disclose all conceivable risks regardless of how trivial or remote, because any undisclosed possibility defeats consent. Materiality does not require consideration of alternatives or the patient’s circumstances.**\n- The first part is incorrect. The physician-centered standard is based on professional custom, not solely hospital policy.\n- The second part is a mischaracterization. The patient-centered standard is based on \"material\" risk, not \"all conceivable\" risks. Disclosing every remote and trivial risk is seen as counterproductive to informed decision-making.\n- The final sentence is incorrect. Alternatives and patient circumstances are central to the materiality analysis.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Under the physician-centered standard, disclosure is mandatory only if the statistical probability of a risk exceeds a fixed threshold; under the patient-centered standard, materiality is determined purely by probability, such that severity and treatment alternatives are irrelevant unless the probability is high.**\n- The first part is incorrect. The physician-centered standard is based on custom, not a fixed probability threshold.\n- The second part is incorrect. Under the patient-centered standard, materiality is a complex balance of factors, with severity often being more important than probability, especially for grave risks. It is not determined \"purely by probability.\"\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The physician-centered and patient-centered standards are functionally identical because both rely exclusively on community medical custom to define disclosure; the patient’s subjective preferences are never relevant to materiality even if known to the clinician.**\n- This statement is fundamentally false. The two standards are distinct precisely because the patient-centered standard moves *away* from exclusive reliance on medical custom.\n- The claim that known patient preferences are \"never relevant\" is directly contrary to the \"in the patient's position\" element of the patient-centered test.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Under the physician-centered standard, disclosure is governed by a reasonable patient test; under the patient-centered standard, materiality depends solely on the particular patient’s subjective wishes, even if those wishes were never communicated and could not reasonably have been known to the clinician at the time of consent.**\n- This option incorrectly swaps the tests for the two standards. The physician-centered standard is governed by a \"reasonable physician\" test.\n- It also mischaracterizes the patient-centered standard as purely subjective. The test is objective (\"reasonable person\") but tailored to the patient's *known* circumstances. A physician is not held to a standard of knowing uncommunicated and unknowable wishes.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the principled derivation and option-by-option analysis, Option A is the only statement that accurately distinguishes the two standards and correctly outlines the criteria for materiality.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4487782"}, {"introduction": "Beyond individual doctor-patient interactions, the very system for addressing medical injury has evolved.

Policymakers have piloted an administrative no-fault compensation scheme modeled on Nordic patient injury systems and the United States Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), in which eligibility turns on defined injury criteria rather than fault. The pilot produced the following aggregate observations, each measured per the same hospital cohort and adjusted for casemix: average claim resolution time under tort $t_T = 36$ months versus administrative $t_A = 9$ months; share of medically injured patients receiving compensation under tort $p_T = 0.25$ versus administrative $p_A = 0.65$; proportion of total expenditures consumed by legal and administrative costs under tort $c_T = 0.50$ versus administrative $c_A = 0.20$; adverse event occurrences per $10{,}000$ admissions under tort $R_T = 35$ versus administrative $R_A = 33$. Policymakers must decide whether to adopt the administrative scheme permanently, knowing that tort-based redress historically evolved to vindicate individual rights through fault-finding and jury assessment, while administrative systems evolved to broaden access and speed compensation with expert adjudication.\n\nUsing first principles—namely, (i) that tort-based deterrence arises from the expected sanction facing a provider when negligence is alleged and proven, and (ii) that fairness can be understood in two complementary senses: horizontal fairness (similarly situated injured patients receive similar compensation) and fault-responsiveness (alignment between sanction and negligent conduct)—which of the following options most accurately distinguishes administrative compensation from tort-based redress and justifies the principal trade-offs in speed, fairness, and deterrence indicated by the pilot?\n\nA. Administrative no-fault prioritizes compensation without requiring proof of fault, increasing speed and breadth of access while lowering transaction costs; however, because individual providers face lower expected negligence sanctions, deterrence may weaken unless accompanied by robust safety regulation and reporting. Given $t_A < t_T$, $p_A > p_T$, $c_A < c_T$, and only modest change from $R_T$ to $R_A$, adopting no-fault is justified if the policy objective is rapid and horizontally fair compensation.\n\nB. Tort-based redress maximizes fairness because awards reflect fault and damages, and although slower and costlier, it deters errors by compensating a higher share of injuries; therefore the pilot’s results favor retaining tort to improve both fairness and deterrence.\n\nC. Administrative schemes are slower but fairer because they avoid jury variability and ensure proportionality in awards; they also increase deterrence since more claims are paid, as shown by $p_A > p_T$.\n\nD.

The concepts presented (tort law, no-fault systems, deterrence, fairness) are standard and well-established in legal and economic scholarship. The provided data are hypothetical but plausible and internally consistent, reflecting known trade-offs between these systems. The problem does not violate any principles of logic or science.\n2.  **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant:** The problem is well-formalized. It provides quantitative data and precise (for the purpose of the problem) definitions of deterrence and fairness, allowing for a rigorous, deductive analysis. The topic is a comparative analysis of medical redress systems, which is central to the field of medical law.\n3.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup:** The problem is self-contained. It provides all necessary data and analytical principles to evaluate the options. The data are not contradictory; for example, the administrative system is shown to be faster ($t_A < t_T$), more inclusive ($p_A > p_T$), and more efficient ($c_A < c_T$), which are its intended design features.\n4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible:** The data values are realistic. Studies comparing tort and no-fault systems often find that no-fault is quicker, cheaper to administer, and compensates a higher percentage of injured parties. A small change in adverse event rates is also a plausible outcome of such a pilot.\n5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured:** The problem is well-posed. It asks for the option that *most accurately* distinguishes the systems and justifies the trade-offs based on a specific, provided framework (the data and first principles). A unique, best answer can be determined through logical analysis. The terms are sufficiently defined for the context.\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological:** The problem is not trivial. It requires the synthesis of quantitative data with qualitative legal and ethical principles to evaluate a complex policy trade-off, which is a substantive analytical task.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability:** The problem is a logical deduction puzzle. Its solution is verifiable within the framework of a closed-form logical system defined by the premises and data.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-constructed, logically consistent, and solvable analytical problem. The process will proceed to the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to evaluate the two systems based on the provided data and principles.\n\n**Analysis of Speed, Access, and Cost:**\n\n-   **Speed:** The administrative scheme is significantly faster, with a resolution time of $t_A = 9$ months compared to the tort system's $t_T = 36$ months.\n-   **Access:** The administrative scheme provides compensation to a much larger share of injured patients ($p_A = 0.65$ or $65\\%$) than the tort system ($p_T = 0.25$ or $25\\%$).\n-   **Cost-Efficiency:** The administrative scheme has much lower overhead costs, consuming only $c_A = 0.20$ ($20\\%$) of expenditures, versus $c_T = 0.50$ ($50\\%$) for the tort system.\n\nThese data points unequivocally show that the administrative scheme is superior in terms of speed, breadth of access, and administrative efficiency.\n\n**Analysis of Fairness:**\n\n-   **Horizontal Fairness:** This principle requires that similarly situated patients receive similar outcomes. Since the administrative scheme compensates a far greater proportion of injured patients ($p_A > p_T$) based on \"defined injury criteria,\" it offers a more consistent outcome for the general class of \"medically injured patients.\" The tort system, by compensating only a fraction ($p_T = 0.25$), inherently treats similarly injured patients differently (some receive large awards, most receive nothing), thus scoring lower on horizontal fairness.\n-   **Fault-Responsiveness:** This principle requires alignment between sanction and negligence. The tort system is explicitly designed around this, as it requires proving fault. The administrative system is \"no-fault,\" meaning it deliberately sacrifices fault-responsiveness to achieve other goals like speed and access.\n\nTherefore, there is a trade-off in fairness: the administrative system promotes horizontal fairness, while the tort system promotes fault-responsiveness.\n\n**Analysis of Deterrence:**\n\n-   The principle states that deterrence in tort arises from the \"expected sanction...when negligence is...proven.\" By removing the need to prove negligence, the administrative system weakens or eliminates this specific provider-facing sanction mechanism. This creates a theoretical risk of reduced deterrence.\n-   The empirical data on adverse events, which can be a proxy for the system's overall effect on patient safety, show a slight decrease from $R_T = 35$ to $R_A = 33$ per $10,000$ admissions. This outcome is modest but directionally positive (i.e., safety did not worsen). This suggests either that the tort system's deterrent effect is not as strong as presumed, or that the administrative system introduces other safety-promoting mechanisms (e.g., improved data collection and analysis for system-level improvements) that compensate for or outweigh the loss of fault-based sanction. A logical policy conclusion is that while the primary fault-based deterrent is weakened, it does not necessarily lead to worse safety outcomes, and its weakening might be managed with other regulatory tools.\n\n**Summary of Trade-offs:**\n\nThe jurisdiction faces a choice. The administrative scheme offers empirically verified, large gains in speed, efficiency, and access (horizontal fairness). The cost is a sacrifice of the principle of fault-responsiveness and a change in the mechanism of deterrence. The pilot data suggest that this change in deterrence does not lead to a negative safety outcome, and may even be associated with a small improvement.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Administrative no-fault prioritizes compensation without requiring proof of fault, increasing speed and breadth of access while lowering transaction costs; however, because individual providers face lower expected negligence sanctions, deterrence may weaken unless accompanied by robust safety regulation and reporting. Given $t_A < t_T$, $p_A > p_T$, $c_A < c_T$, and only modest change from $R_T$ to $R_A$, adopting no-fault is justified if the policy objective is rapid and horizontally fair compensation.**\n\n-   This option correctly states that the administrative scheme is no-fault and that this leads to increased speed ($t_A < t_T$), access ($p_A > p_T$), and efficiency ($c_A < c_T$). It accurately applies the deterrence principle (i) by noting the weakened sanction on individual providers and the potential need for other safety measures. It correctly characterizes the change in adverse event rates ($R_T$ to $R_A$) as \"modest.\" Finally, it draws a logical conclusion: if the policy goal is rapid and horizontally fair compensation (which the administrative system excels at), adoption is justified. This statement aligns perfectly with the data and principles.\n-   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. Tort-based redress maximizes fairness because awards reflect fault and damages, and although slower and costlier, it deters errors by compensating a higher share of injuries; therefore the pilot’s results favor retaining tort to improve both fairness and deterrence.**\n\n-   This option makes several claims that are factually incorrect based on the problem statement. It claims tort \"deters errors by compensating a higher share of injuries,\" but the data show $p_T = 0.25$ and $p_A = 0.65$, meaning tort compensates a *lower* share. Its claim that tort \"maximizes fairness\" is a biased oversimplification, as it only considers fault-responsiveness and ignores the system's poor performance on horizontal fairness. The conclusion that the results favor retaining tort is contradicted by the overwhelming evidence of the administrative scheme's superior performance on speed, cost, and access, and equivalent-or-better performance on the safety proxy ($R_A \\le R_T$).\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Administrative schemes are slower but fairer because they avoid jury variability and ensure proportionality in awards; they also increase deterrence since more claims are paid, as shown by $p_A > p_T$.**\n\n-   This option begins with a statement that is directly false: \"Administrative schemes are slower.\" The data clearly shows $t_A = 9$ months and $t_T = 36$ months. It also provides a flawed explanation for deterrence, suggesting that paying more claims under no-fault automatically increases deterrence. This conflates patient compensation with provider sanction; the defined deterrence principle is based on sanctioning a provider for *proven negligence*, a link that the no-fault system breaks.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Tort provides rapid compensation and low transaction costs, and because it requires proof of negligence, it targets only preventable injuries, making it fairer in access than administrative schemes; the pilot’s $t_T$ and $c_T$ support this.**\n\n-   This option is contradicted by the data on nearly every point. It claims tort is \"rapid\" ($t_T = 36$ months) and has \"low transaction costs\" ($c_T = 0.50$). Both are false. It claims tort is \"fairer in access,\" but it compensates a much smaller fraction of injured patients ($p_T = 0.25$) than the administrative scheme ($p_A = 0.65$). The final claim that the data ($t_T$ and $c_T$) support these assertions is a patent falsehood.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4487765"}]}
