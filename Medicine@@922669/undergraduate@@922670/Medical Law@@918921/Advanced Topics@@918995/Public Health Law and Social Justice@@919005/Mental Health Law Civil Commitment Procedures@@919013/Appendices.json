Rely only on the following foundational principles and definitions, which capture widely accepted procedural safeguards at commitment hearings:\n\n1. Timely adjudication: After a petition is filed, a commitment hearing must commence within a specified number of court days to reduce the risk of erroneous deprivation of liberty. Here, the statute requires that the hearing commence not later than the close of court business on the third court day after filing.\n2. Adequate notice: The respondent and appointed counsel must receive notice sufficiently in advance of the hearing to prepare a defense. Here, statutory adequate notice is satisfied only if at least $36$ continuous hours elapse between the later of respondent notice and counsel notice, and the start of the hearing.\n3. Right to counsel with meaningful preparation: Counsel must be appointed sufficiently before the hearing to allow preparation. Here, the minimum preparation time is $24$ continuous hours from the time of appointment.\n4. Independent evaluation: An independent psychiatric examiner’s report must be filed sufficiently before the hearing to allow meaningful use at the hearing. Here, the report must be filed at least $12$ continuous hours before the hearing.\n5. Court-day counting and court hours: A court day is any weekday (Monday through Friday) that is not a state holiday. The first court day counted for the hearing deadline is the next court day after filing. Court hours are $09{:}00$ to $17{:}00$ local time. Hearings must begin during court hours.\n6. Emergency detention and petition filing: Emergency detention may precede the petition, but the petition must be filed within $24$ hours of the start of detention. Assume that requirement is independently enforced and does not itself set the hearing time, except insofar as it constrains the filing date and time.\n\nAssume there are no state holidays during the relevant week. In a particular case, the following undisputed timestamps occur (all in the same local time zone):\n\n- Emergency detention begins on Monday, March $10$, $2025$, at $21{:}00$.\n- The petition is filed on Tuesday, March $11$, $2025$, at $15{:}10$.\n- Counsel is appointed on Wednesday, March $12$, $2025$, at $12{:}10$.\n- Notice is served on the respondent on Wednesday, March $12$, $2025$, at $09{:}15$.\n- Notice is served on counsel on Wednesday, March $12$, $2025$, at $14{:}45$.\n- The independent examiner’s report is filed on Thursday, March $13$, $2025$, at $20{:}30$.\n\nUsing only the principles and definitions above, determine the maximum legally permissible duration, in hours, from the start of emergency detention to the start of the commitment hearing, such that all safeguards are simultaneously satisfied. Express your final answer as a single real number of hours. Do not round.", "solution": "The user wants me to determine the maximum legally permissible duration, in hours, from the start of emergency detention to the start of a commitment hearing, subject to a set of specified rules and timestamps.\n\nTo solve this problem, we must first determine the permissible time window for the commitment hearing to begin. Let $T_{hearing}$ denote the start time of the hearing. This window is defined by a series of constraints derived from the provided rules. The problem asks for the maximum duration from detention to hearing, which means we must find the latest possible valid time for $T_{hearing}$ and calculate the time elapsed from the start of detention.\n\nLet us denote the given timestamps as follows:\n-   $T_{detention}$: Monday, March $10$, $2025$, at $21{:}00$.\n-   $T_{petition}$: Tuesday, March $11$, $2025$, at $15{:}10$.\n-   $T_{counsel\\_appt}$: Wednesday, March $12$, $2025$, at $12{:}10$.\n-   $T_{resp\\_notice}$: Wednesday, March $12$, $2025$, at $09{:}15$.\n-   $T_{counsel\\_notice}$: Wednesday, March $12$, $2025$, at $14{:}45$.\n-   $T_{report}$: Thursday, March $13$, $2025$, at $20{:}30$.\n\nWe analyze each constraint to determine its effect on the permissible range for $T_{hearing}$.\n\n**1. The Upper Bound: Timely Adjudication (Rule 1)**\nThis rule sets the ultimate deadline for the hearing.\n-   The petition was filed on Tuesday, March $11$, $2025$.\n-   According to Rule $5$, the first court day counted is the next court day after filing. Since the filing was on a Tuesday, the first court day is Wednesday, March $12$.\n-   The second court day is Thursday, March $13$.\n-   The third court day is Friday, March $14$.\n-   The hearing must commence no later than the close of court business on this third day. Court hours are $09{:}00$ to $17{:}00$. Thus, the close of business is at $17{:}00$.\n-   This establishes an upper bound for the hearing start time: $T_{hearing} \\le \\text{Friday, March } 14, 2025, 17{:}00$.\n\n**2. The Lower Bounds: Safeguard-Imposed Minimum Start Times**\nSeveral rules require a minimum amount of time to pass before the hearing can begin. $T_{hearing}$ must be at or after the latest of these calculated times.\n\n**a. Adequate Notice (Rule 2)**\n-   This rule requires at least $36$ continuous hours between the start of the hearing and the *later* of the notice to the respondent and the notice to counsel.\n-   $T_{resp\\_notice}$ is Wednesday at $09{:}15$.\n-   $T_{counsel\\_notice}$ is Wednesday at $14{:}45$.\n-   The later time is $T_{counsel\\_notice}$. Let this be $T_{notice\\_event} = \\text{Wednesday, March } 12, 14{:}45$.\n-   The earliest hearing start time under this rule is $T_{notice\\_event} + 36 \\text{ hours}$.\n-   Calculation: Wednesday, $14{:}45 + 36 \\text{ hours} = \\text{Wednesday, } 14{:}45 + (24 + 12) \\text{ hours} = \\text{Thursday, } 14{:}45 + 12 \\text{ hours} = \\text{Friday, } 02{:}45$.\n-   Thus, constraint (a) requires: $T_{hearing} \\ge \\text{Friday, March } 14, 02{:}45$.\n\n**b. Right to Counsel (Rule 3)**\n-   This rule requires at least $24$ continuous hours for counsel preparation, starting from the time of appointment.\n-   $T_{counsel\\_appt}$ is Wednesday, March $12$, at $12{:}10$.\n-   The earliest hearing start time under this rule is $T_{counsel\\_appt} + 24 \\text{ hours}$.\n-   Calculation: Wednesday, $12{:}10 + 24 \\text{ hours} = \\text{Thursday, } 12{:}10$.\n-   Thus, constraint (b) requires: $T_{hearing} \\ge \\text{Thursday, March } 13, 12{:}10$.\n\n**c. Independent Evaluation (Rule 4)**\n-   This rule requires the examiner's report to be filed at least $12$ continuous hours before the hearing.\n-   $T_{report}$ is Thursday, March $13$, at $20{:}30$.\n-   The earliest hearing start time under this rule is $T_{report} + 12 \\text{ hours}$.\n-   Calculation: Thursday, $20{:}30 + 12 \\text{ hours} = \\text{Friday, } 08{:}30$.\n-   Thus, constraint (c) requires: $T_{hearing} \\ge \\text{Friday, March } 14, 08{:}30$.\n\n**3. Synthesizing the Constraints to Find the Permissible Window**\nThe hearing must satisfy all constraints simultaneously.\n-   The combined lower bound is the latest of the individual lower bounds:\n    -   From (a): Friday, $02{:}45$\n    -   From (b): Thursday, $12{:}10$\n    -   From (c): Friday, $08{:}30$\n-   The latest of these is Friday, March $14$, at $08{:}30$. So, $T_{hearing} \\ge \\text{Friday, March } 14, 08{:}30$.\n\n-   Additionally, Rule $5$ states that hearings must begin during court hours, which are $09{:}00$ to $17{:}00$.\n-   The earliest the hearing can start must be the later of the combined lower bound and the start of court hours on that day.\n-   The day is Friday, March $14$. The lower bound is $08{:}30$. The court opens at $09{:}00$. Therefore, the effective earliest start time is Friday, March $14$, at $09{:}00$.\n\n-   The permissible window for $T_{hearing}$ begins at Friday, March $14$, $09{:}00$ and ends at the deadline calculated from Rule $1$, which is Friday, March $14$, $17{:}00$.\n-   Permissible window: $[ \\text{Friday, March } 14, 09{:}00, \\text{ Friday, March } 14, 17{:}00 ]$.\n\n**4. Calculating the Maximum Duration**\nTo find the maximum legally permissible duration from detention to hearing, we must select the latest possible start time for the hearing, which is the upper end of the permissible window.\n-   $T_{hearing\\_max} = \\text{Friday, March } 14, 2025, 17{:}00$.\n-   The start of detention was $T_{detention} = \\text{Monday, March } 10, 2025, 21{:}00$.\n\nThe duration is the total number of hours between these two timestamps.\n-   Time remaining on Monday, March $10$: $24{:}00 - 21{:}00 = 3$ hours.\n-   Time for Tuesday, March $11$: $24$ hours.\n-   Time for Wednesday, March $12$: $24$ hours.\n-   Time for Thursday, March $13$: $24$ hours.\n-   Time on Friday, March $14$: $17$ hours (from $00{:}00$ to $17{:}00$).\n\nTotal duration = $3 + 24 + 24 + 24 + 17 = 92$ hours.\n\nAlternatively, the number of full days between Monday $21{:}00$ and Friday $21{:}00$ is $4$ days. This is $4 \\times 24 = 96$ hours. Since the hearing ends at $17{:}00$ on Friday, not $21{:}00$, we subtract the difference: $21{:}00 - 17{:}00 = 4$ hours. The total duration is $96 - 4 = 92$ hours.\n\nThe maximum legally permissible duration from the start of emergency detention to the start of the commitment hearing is $92$ hours.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{92}$$", "id": "4496940"}, {"introduction": "Legal standards such as 'probable cause' often seem subjective, but they can be analyzed with the rigorous logic of probability theory.

In a judicial review of proposed interventions for an individual, the court uses the following operationalization, grounded in the statute’s core definitions, to make a determination:\n\n1.
