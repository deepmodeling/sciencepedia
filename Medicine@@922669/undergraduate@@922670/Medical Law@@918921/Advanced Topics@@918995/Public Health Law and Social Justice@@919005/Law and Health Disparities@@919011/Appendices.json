A critical first step in legal and ethical oversight is learning how to quantify potential discrimination.

Mastering this calculation provides a primary tool for identifying red flags in algorithmic systems that may warrant deeper investigation [@problem_id:4491417].", "problem": "A health system deploys an algorithmic risk score to flag patients for enhanced care coordination.

Within the framework of United States civil rights law addressing disparate impact and the screening heuristic commonly referred to as the four-fifths rule used by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), treat the proportion flagged at equal need as the selection rate for each group.

The \"four-fifths rule\" is a specific, widely known heuristic used by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) as a rule of thumb to identify potential adverse impact in employment selection processes. Its application by analogy to algorithmic fairness in other domains, such as healthcare, is a standard practice in the field. The provided data are proportions, which are mathematically sound. The problem is scientifically and factually sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data and a clear definition of the task. The disparate impact ratio is a standard metric with an unambiguous formula. A unique solution can be calculated from the givens.\n-   **Objective**: The language is objective and quantitative. It asks for a specific calculation based on numerical data and a defined rule.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the calculation of the disparate impact ratio, a metric used to assess whether a selection process has a disproportionately adverse effect on a protected group compared to a reference group.\n\nLet $S_{\\text{protected}}$ be the selection rate for the protected group (Black patients) and $S_{\\text{reference}}$ be the selection rate for the reference group (White patients). From the problem statement, the selection rates are the proportions of patients flagged by the algorithm.\n\nThe given values are:\n$$ S_{\\text{protected}} = f_{\\text{Black}} = 0.20 $$\n$$ S_{\\text{reference}} = f_{\\text{White}} = 0.40 $$\n\nThe disparate impact ratio (DIR) is defined as the ratio of the selection rate for the protected group to the selection rate for the reference group.\n\n$$ \\text{DIR} = \\frac{S_{\\text{protected}}}{S_{\\text{reference}}} $$\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$ \\text{DIR} = \\frac{f_{\\text{Black}}}{f_{\\text{White}}} = \\frac{0.20}{0.40} $$\n\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$ \\text{DIR} = 0.5 $$\n\nThe problem asks for an assessment based on the four-fifths rule. The four-fifths rule, sometimes called the $80\\%$ rule, suggests that if the selection rate for a protected group is less than four-fifths (or $80\\%$) of the selection rate for the group with the highest rate, it can be considered evidence of disparate impact. The threshold value is $\\frac{4}{5} = 0.8$.\n\nIn this case, the calculated disparate impact ratio is $0.5$. Since $0.5  0.8$, the selection process would fail the four-fifths rule test. This suggests a prima facie case of disparate impact that would typically warrant further investigation.\n\nThe final answer required is the disparate impact ratio expressed as a pure decimal and rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $0.5$. To express this with four significant figures, we append trailing zeros.\n\n$$ \\text{DIR} = 0.5000 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5000}$$", "id": "4491417"}, {"introduction": "Discrimination in health insurance can be subtle, operating not through explicit exclusion but through benefit design that makes care unaffordable for those with specific health conditions. This practice builds upon the concept of disparate impact to explore \"proxy discrimination,\" where a plan design that appears neutral on its face disproportionately harms individuals with a disability. By applying the four-fifths rule in the context of a pharmacy formulary, you will learn to analyze how benefit structures can function as a proxy for a protected characteristic, a key skill for ensuring compliance with laws like the Affordable Care Act [@problem_id:4491430].", "problem": "A health plan uses a two-tier formulary for maintenance medications. Insulin products predominantly used by individuals with Type 1 diabetes are placed in a higher cost-sharing tier with per-fill cost-sharing $c_{Type1} = \\$50$, while the lower tier has per-fill cost-sharing $c_{low} = \\$10$. Non-diabetic comparators (for example, users of non-diabetic chronic maintenance medications within the same formulary tier structure) are assigned to the lower tier for all fills, with per-fill cost-sharing $c_{nonDiabetic} = \\$10$. In recent utilization data, $0.8$ of Type 1 diabetic insulin fills are assigned to the higher cost-sharing tier (and therefore $0.2$ are in the lower tier).\n\nStarting from the legal foundation that Section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) forbids discrimination on the basis of disability and that a facially neutral plan feature can be challenged under a disparate impact theory, apply the commonly used adverse impact screening heuristic from the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (UGESP), often referred to as the four-fifths rule. Treat the favorable outcome as assignment to the lower cost-sharing tier, and the selection rate for each group as the probability of assignment to the lower tier.

It presents a self-contained, logically consistent, and well-posed question. The scenario is grounded in the real-world application of legal and statistical heuristics to health plan benefit design, a topic within medical law and health policy. All data required for the calculation are explicitly provided, and the terminology is defined. The problem requires the application of a specified quantitative rule, the four-fifths rule, to determine a binary outcome.\n\nThe problem asks to compute a binary indicator, $I$, for a prima facie case of discrimination under a disparate impact theory, using the four-fifths rule as the screening heuristic. The rule, originating from the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (UGESP), is a tool to assess adverse impact. It states that an adverse impact is suggested if the selection rate for a protected group is less than four-fifths (or $80\\%$) of the selection rate for the group with the highest rate.\n\nLet us define the two groups in this problem:\n1.  The protected group, which consists of individuals with Type 1 diabetes. We shall denote this group as $D$.\n2.  The comparator group, which consists of non-diabetic individuals using chronic maintenance medications. We shall denote this group as $N$.\n\nThe \"favorable outcome\" is defined as assignment to the lower cost-sharing tier. The \"selection rate\" for each group is the probability of this favorable outcome. Let $S_D$ be the selection rate for group $D$ and $S_N$ be the selection rate for group $N$.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we extract the following probabilities:\n- For the comparator group $N$, individuals \"are assigned to the lower tier for all fills\". This implies a probability of $1$ for the favorable outcome. Thus, the selection rate for group $N$ is $S_N = 1$.\n- For the protected group $D$, \"$0.8$ of Type 1 diabetic insulin fills are assigned to the higher cost-sharing tier\". The remainder, or $1 - 0.8 = 0.2$, are assigned to the lower tier. The problem confirms this by stating \"and therefore $0.2$ are in the lower tier\". Therefore, the selection rate for group $D$ is $S_D = 0.2$.\n\nThe four-fifths rule compares the selection rate of the protected group to the selection rate of the comparator (highest-rate) group. Adverse impact is indicated if the following inequality holds:\n$$S_{protected}  \\frac{4}{5} \\times S_{comparator}$$\nIn our case, group $N$ has the higher selection rate ($S_N = 1 > S_D = 0.2$), so it serves as the comparator group. The inequality becomes:\n$$S_D  \\frac{4}{5} S_N$$\nSubstituting the numerical values for the selection rates:\n$$0.2  \\frac{4}{5} \\times 1$$\nWe can write the fraction $\\frac{4}{5}$ as the decimal $0.8$:\n$$0.2  0.8 \\times 1$$\n$$0.2  0.8$$\nThis inequality is true.\n\nThe problem defines the binary indicator $I$ such that $I=1$ if the pattern supports a prima facie case of discrimination, and $I=0$ otherwise. Since the condition for the four-fifths rule is met, a prima facie case is supported by this heuristic.\n\nTherefore, the value of the indicator is $I = 1$. The cost-sharing values, $c_{\\text{Type1}} = \\$50$, $c_{\\text{low}} = \\$10$, and $c_{\\text{nonDiabetic}} = \\$10$, provide context for the disparity but are not directly used in the calculation of the indicator $I$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "4491430"}, {"introduction": "Measuring the magnitude of a health disparity is often the starting point for legal action, particularly for vulnerable populations such as those in correctional facilities. This exercise introduces the risk ratio ($RR$), another fundamental epidemiological tool for comparing outcomes between groups. More importantly, it challenges you to connect a stark statistical finding to the stringent legal standard of \"deliberate indifference\" under constitutional law. This practice hones your ability not only to calculate a disparity but to critically assess the limits of what that statistic alone can prove, a crucial distinction in constructing a sound legal argument [@problem_id:4491339].", "problem": "A state oversight committee asks a public health lawyer to analyze disparities in the incidence of Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA), defined as a serious diabetes complication involving high levels of blood ketones and acidosis requiring urgent medical intervention.

To achieve this, we add a trailing zero.\n$$RR = 4.40$$\nThis result indicates that the incidence of DKA is $4.40$ times higher in the incarcerated population compared to the general population.\n\n**Part 2: Reasoned Assessment of the Disparity**\n\nThe second task is to assess whether this statistically significant disparity ($RR = 4.40$) *alone* plausibly signals potential deliberate indifference or is more likely to reflect systemic issues. This assessment must be grounded in the provided legal standard.\n\nThe legal standard for deliberate indifference is composed of two essential elements:\n1.  A **serious medical need**.\n2.  **Knowledge** of the risk associated with that need and a **reckless disregard** for that risk (a culpable state of mind).\n\nLet us analyze the evidence—the risk ratio—against these two elements from first principles.\n\nFirst, the \"serious medical need\" element is unquestionably satisfied. DKA is explicitly defined in the problem as a \"serious diabetes complication...requiring urgent medical intervention.\" A population-level incidence rate of $\\frac{22}{10{,}000}$ confirms that this serious medical need is manifesting at a high rate within the prison system.\n\nSecond, we must evaluate the \"knowledge and reckless disregard\" element. This is a question of causation and intent. A risk ratio is a measure of association or correlation; it is not, in itself, proof of causation or a specific mental state. The elevated $RR$ of $4.40$ demonstrates a severe disparity in outcomes, but it does not, *in isolation*, explain *why* this disparity exists.\n\nTo prove deliberate indifference, one would need to show that prison officials were aware of a substantial risk of serious harm to inmates and consciously chose to ignore it. The statistic $RR = 4.40$ can serve as powerful evidence that a systemic problem exists, which could contribute to establishing that officials *should have had* knowledge of the risk. However, it does not prove that they acted with reckless disregard. There are alternative, plausible explanations for the observed disparity that do not necessarily involve the culpable state of mind required for deliberate indifference:\n\n*   **Structural Determinants of Health**: The incarcerated population is not a random sample of the general population. It is well-documented that incarcerated individuals, as a group, enter the correctional system with a higher burden of chronic disease (including diabetes), substance use disorders, mental illness, and have experienced lower socioeconomic status and less access to healthcare prior to incarceration. These pre-existing factors (confounding variables) could contribute significantly to a higher baseline risk of DKA, regardless of the quality of care provided within the prison. The provided data does not adjust for these baseline differences.\n*   **Systemic Resource Constraints**: A high rate of DKA could result from systemic deficiencies such as understaffing, lack of specialized medical personnel, or inadequate funding for chronic disease management programs. While such conditions may constitute negligence or medical malpractice, they do not automatically meet the higher legal standard of deliberate indifference, which requires a conscious or willful disregard of a known risk, rather than mere incompetence or lack of resources.\n\nIn conclusion, the calculated risk ratio of $4.40$ is a critical piece of evidence. It strongly signals a major public health problem and a severe health disparity that demands immediate investigation. It provides substantial weight to the argument that a serious medical need is going unmet on a large scale. However, the statistic *alone* is insufficient to prove deliberate indifference. It establishes a correlation, but it cannot, by itself, disentangle the cause from a web of potential factors including pre-existing health status and systemic resource issues versus a culpable state of \"reckless disregard\" by specific actors. Therefore, the disparity is a powerful indicator that warrants scrutiny, but it more likely reflects a complex interplay of systemic and structural factors. A definitive conclusion of deliberate indifference would require further evidence linking specific actions or inactions of officials directly to the poor outcomes.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4.40}\n$$", "id": "4491339"}]}
