This first practice moves from abstract principles to concrete measurement by asking you to operationalize the concept of accessibility. By calculating a simple public health metric, you will learn how quantitative indicators are used to create benchmarks, monitor progress, and hold health systems accountable to their \"minimum core obligations\" under human rights law [@problem_id:4489336].", "problem": "A rights-based assessment of health system accessibility begins from the normative framework of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) Article 12 and the Availability, Accessibility, Acceptability, and Quality (AAAQ) framework articulated in General Comment No. $14$ by the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR). Under minimum core obligations, a state must ensure non-discriminatory access to essential primary care. To operationalize accessibility for planning and monitoring, consider a simple density metric that captures how many primary care facilities are within reasonable geographic reach of the population in need.\n\nA state sets a policy benchmark that, at a minimum, there should be at least one accessible primary care facility within $10$ km for every $20{,}000$ persons in need. In a region, there are $112$ healthcare sites. Of these, $24$ are specialized referral centers not providing primary care. The remainder are primary care facilities. Of the primary care facilities, $19$ are located beyond $10$ km of any population cluster and are therefore not counted as accessible for the purpose of this metric. The region’s total population is $2.4 \\times 10^{6}$, and the proportion of the population in need of essential primary care services during the current year is $0.60$.\n\nUsing only these facts and the AAAQ framework as your foundational basis, compute the accessibility density $A$ defined as the number of accessible primary care facilities per person in need, and then, in your explanation, articulate how such a threshold relates to right-to-health benchmarks and the concepts of minimum core obligations and progressive realization. Express $A$ as a decimal in standard scientific notation and round your answer to four significant figures. No units are required in the final numeric value.", "solution": "The problem is assessed as valid. It is self-contained, internally consistent, and scientifically grounded in the methods of quantitative public health and policy analysis. All necessary data for the calculation are provided, and the terms are defined unambiguously. The problem formalizes concepts from international law into a solvable quantitative question, which is a standard practice in operationalizing policy.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts. First, the accessibility density $A$ is calculated. Second, the result is contextualized within the provided human rights framework.\n\nLet $N_{total\\_sites}$ be the total number of healthcare sites in the region.\nLet $N_{specialized}$ be the number of specialized referral centers.\nLet $N_{pcf}$ be the number of primary care facilities.\nLet $N_{inaccessible}$ be the number of primary care facilities not counted as accessible under the given definition.\nLet $N_{accessible}$ be the number of accessible primary care facilities.\n\nAccording to the givens:\n$N_{total\\_sites} = 112$\n$N_{specialized} = 24$\n\nThe number of primary care facilities is the total number of sites minus the specialized centers:\n$$N_{pcf} = N_{total\\_sites} - N_{specialized} = 112 - 24 = 88$$\n\nOf these primary care facilities, $N_{inaccessible} = 19$ are not counted as accessible. Therefore, the number of accessible facilities is:\n$$N_{accessible} = N_{pcf} - N_{inaccessible} = 88 - 19 = 69$$\n\nNext, we calculate the number of persons in need of essential primary care.\nLet $P_{total}$ be the total population of the region.\nLet $f_{need}$ be the proportion of the population in need.\nLet $P_{need}$ be the absolute number of persons in need.\n\nAccording to the givens:\n$P_{total} = 2.4 \\times 10^{6}$\n$f_{need} = 0.60$\n\nThe number of persons in need is:\n$$P_{need} = P_{total} \\times f_{need} = (2.4 \\times 10^{6}) \\times 0.60 = 1.44 \\times 10^{6}$$\n\nThe accessibility density $A$ is defined as the number of accessible primary care facilities per person in need.\n$$A = \\frac{N_{accessible}}{P_{need}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$A = \\frac{69}{1.44 \\times 10^{6}} \\approx 47.91666... \\times 10^{-6}$$\nTo express this in standard scientific notation, we adjust the exponent:\n$$A \\approx 4.791666... \\times 10^{-5}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required:\n$$A \\approx 4.792 \\times 10^{-5}$$\n\nFor the second part of the task, we must articulate how this quantitative result relates to the concepts of right-to-health benchmarks, minimum core obligations, and progressive realization.\n\nFirst, we must quantify the state's policy benchmark. The benchmark is at least one accessible facility for every $20{,}000$ persons in need. Let's call this benchmark density $A_{benchmark}$.\n$$A_{benchmark} = \\frac{1 \\text{ facility}}{20{,}000 \\text{ persons}} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 10^{4}} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-4} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}$$\nComparing the calculated accessibility density $A$ with the benchmark $A_{benchmark}$:\n$$A \\approx 4.792 \\times 10^{-5}$$\n$$A_{benchmark} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}$$\nWe find that $A < A_{benchmark}$. The region's accessibility density is below the minimum policy benchmark set by the state.\n\nThe relationship to the specified concepts is as follows:\n1.  **Right-to-Health Benchmarks**: The state's policy ($1$ facility per $20{,}000$ persons) is a prime example of a **benchmark**. The AAAQ framework provides qualitative standards (e.g., services must be physically accessible). To make these standards operational for policy and monitoring, states translate them into quantitative targets. The threshold $A_{benchmark} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}$ is such a target. The calculated metric $A$ serves as an **indicator** used to measure the current status against this benchmark.\n\n2.  **Minimum Core Obligations**: The CESCR's General Comment No. $14$ establishes that states have an immediate minimum core obligation to ensure non-discriminatory access to essential goods and services, including primary healthcare. This is not subject to progressive realization; it must be satisfied. By setting a minimum benchmark for accessibility, the state is effectively defining its own interpretation of this core obligation in concrete terms. The finding that $A < A_{benchmark}$ suggests that the state is failing to meet its own defined minimum core obligation in this region. From a rights-based perspective, this signals a potential violation of the right to health.\n\n3.  **Progressive Realization**: This principle acknowledges that the full realization of the right to health may take time and resources. States are obligated to take \"deliberate, concrete and targeted\" steps towards this full realization. While core obligations are immediate, aspects of the right to health beyond the core are subject to progressive realization. The use of indicators like $A$ and benchmarks like $A_{benchmark}$ is fundamental to monitoring this progress. If the state were to track $A$ over several years and show a consistent increase towards and beyond the benchmark, it would be demonstrating progressive realization. However, the failure to meet the *minimum core* benchmark cannot be justified by appealing to progressive realization alone. The state would be required to demonstrate that it has used the \"maximum of its available resources\" to meet this core obligation and must take immediate steps to rectify the shortfall. The calculation of $A$ thus provides a critical piece of evidence for holding the state accountable to both its immediate core obligations and its long-term duty of progressive realization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.792 \\times 10^{-5}}$$", "id": "4489336"}, {"introduction": "Navigating the rights of children in healthcare requires a delicate balance between parental authority, the child's welfare, and their own developing autonomy. This exercise places you in a common clinical dilemma where a minor's wish for care conflicts with parental objections, challenging you to apply the legal doctrines of \"evolving capacities\" and the \"best interests of the child.\" This practice will help you move beyond simplistic age-based rules to a more nuanced, functional assessment of a young person's capacity to participate in their own healthcare decisions [@problem_id:4489321].", "problem": "A pediatric clinician in a public hospital is asked to provide non-urgent preventive care to a 13-year-old patient, Samira, who seeks vaccination and counseling for sexually transmitted infection prevention. Samira expresses a clear wish to proceed. Her parents object on religious grounds and insist that no care be provided without their consent. National law (consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and common-law capacity tests) recognizes the child’s right to health and requires an individualized assessment of capacity. The clinician must determine whether Samira’s request can be honored and how to weigh parental objections. \n\nStarting from first principles in human rights and medical law, derive the correct characterization of the “best interests of the child,” distinguish it from parental preference, and explain how the doctrine of evolving capacities affects whether the clinician should seek consent from Samira or merely her assent. Base your reasoning on the following core definitions and legal principles:\n\n- The CRC, Article 3: the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration in all actions concerning children.\n- The CRC, Article 12: the child has the right to be heard in all matters affecting the child, with due weight given in accordance with age and maturity.\n- The CRC, Article 5: parents and legal guardians provide appropriate guidance consistent with the evolving capacities of the child.\n- The CRC, Article 24: the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health.\n- Common-law capacity tests in healthcare (for example, “Gillick competence” in some jurisdictions): under-16 patients may consent if they demonstrate sufficient understanding and intelligence to understand fully the proposed intervention; elements include the ability to understand, retain, use and weigh information, and communicate a choice.\n- Distinction between consent (valid authorization by a person with capacity) and assent (affirmative agreement by a person who lacks legal capacity but whose views should still be sought and respected where possible).\n\nWhich one option best expresses the correct legal-ethical approach for the clinician in this case?\n\nA. Best interests are determined by parents’ moral and religious preferences; evolving capacities do not apply until age 16, so parental consent is required and Samira’s views carry no legal weight.\n\nB. Best interests center on Samira’s welfare, including clinical benefits, risks, and her own views; evolving capacities require assessing Samira’s individual maturity and, if she is demonstrably competent, accepting her valid consent despite parental objection; if she is not competent, the clinician should seek her assent, weigh her views, and proceed in her best interests even where parental preferences conflict, escalating only if refusal poses a risk of significant harm.\n\nC. Evolving capacities require always privileging the child’s wishes over any other consideration; parental preferences are irrelevant to best interests, and consent from the child is always sufficient regardless of maturity or risk.\n\nD. Best interests are defined solely by clinical judgment; parents have absolute legal authority to decide until age 18, so the clinician must defer to parental refusal unless there is an emergency.\n\nE. Whenever parents disagree with the child’s wishes, the best interests of the child can only be determined by a court; treatment must not proceed until a judicial order is obtained, regardless of urgency or the child’s maturity.", "solution": "The problem requires a derivation of the correct legal-ethical approach for a clinician in a pediatric scenario involving a conflict between a minor patient's request for care and parental objections. The derivation must be based on a set of provided first principles from human rights law and medical ethics.\n\n**Validation of Problem Statement**\n\nFirst, I shall validate the problem statement according to the specified criteria.\n\n*   **Step 1: Extract Givens**\n    *   **Case:** A pediatric clinician in a public hospital is presented with a 13-year-old patient, Samira.\n    *   **Request:** Samira seeks non-urgent preventive care: vaccination and counseling for sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention.\n    *   **Patient's Position:** Samira \"expresses a clear wish to proceed.\"\n    *   **Parents' Position:** They \"object on religious grounds and insist that no care be provided without their consent.\"\n    *   **Legal Context:** National law is \"consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and common-law capacity tests.\" The law \"recognizes the child’s right to health and requires an individualized assessment of capacity.\"\n    *   **Clinician's Task:** \"determine whether Samira’s request can be honored and how to weigh parental objections.\"\n    *   **Provided Principles:**\n        1.  CRC, Article 3: \"the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration in all actions concerning children.\"\n        2.  CRC, Article 12: \"the child has the right to be heard in all matters affecting the child, with due weight given in accordance with age and maturity.\"\n        3.  CRC, Article 5: \"parents and legal guardians provide appropriate guidance consistent with the evolving capacities of the child.\"\n        4.  CRC, Article 24: \"the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health.\"\n        5.  Common-law capacity tests (e.g., “Gillick competence”): patients under 16 may consent if they demonstrate \"sufficient understanding and intelligence to understand fully the proposed intervention; elements include the ability to understand, retain, use and weigh information, and communicate a choice.\"\n        6.  Consent vs. Assent: \"consent (valid authorization by a person with capacity)\" vs. \"assent (affirmative agreement by a person who lacks legal capacity but whose views should still be sought and respected where possible).\"\n\n*   **Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n    *   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is set within the domain of medical law and ethics. The principles cited (articles of the CRC, the concept of Gillick competence) are actual, foundational tenets in this field. The scenario is a classic, realistic ethical dilemma. The problem is therefore firmly grounded in the established principles of its domain.\n    *   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a specific factual scenario and a closed set of legal and ethical principles to apply. The question asks for the \"best\" approach according to these principles, which allows for a single, most-correct answer to be derived logically.\n    *   **Objective:** The language used is descriptive and non-prejudicial, presenting the facts of the case and the positions of the involved parties without bias.\n\n*   **Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n    The problem is valid. It is a self-contained, objective, and well-posed question based on established principles of medical law and ethics. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or scientific flaws. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in navigating the tension between parental authority, the child's emerging autonomy, and the child's right to health. The provided principles form a framework for resolving this tension.\n\n1.  **The \"Best Interests of the Child\" (CRC, Article 3):** This is the paramount principle. \"Best interests\" is a holistic concept. It is not synonymous with parental preference, nor is it defined solely by the child's wishes or by clinical judgment alone. It must be determined by weighing all relevant factors. CRC Article 24 (right to the highest attainable standard of health) establishes that the clinical benefits of the proposed care (vaccination and STI prevention) are a critical component of Samira's best interests. CRC Article 12 (right to be heard) establishes that Samira's own views are also a key component. CRC Article 5 indicates that parental guidance is a factor, but this guidance itself is qualified by the principle of the child's \"evolving capacities.\" Therefore, parental preferences based on religious grounds are a consideration, but they do not automatically define or override the child's best interests, especially when they conflict with the child's right to health.\n\n2.  **\"Evolving Capacities\" and Capacity Assessment (CRC, Articles 5 & 12, Common Law):** The framework rejects a fixed age of majority for all decisions. Instead, it mandates a functional and individualized approach. The concept of \"evolving capacities\" (Art 5) means that as a child matures, their ability to participate in and make decisions increases. The clinician's legal duty is to perform an \"individualized assessment of capacity.\" The common-law test (like \"Gillick competence\") provides the specific criteria for this assessment: can Samira, a 13-year-old, demonstrate \"sufficient understanding and intelligence\" regarding the proposed preventive care? This includes understanding the benefits, risks, alternatives, and consequences of accepting or refusing treatment. Her age of 13 does not, by itself, determine the outcome of this assessment; her individual maturity is the key.\n\n3.  **Consent vs. Assent:** The outcome of the capacity assessment dictates the legal and ethical path forward.\n    *   **If Samira is Found to Have Capacity:** If the clinician assesses that Samira meets the threshold for competence, she can provide **valid consent** for her own medical care. In this situation, her consent is legally sufficient. While parental objections should be heard respectfully, they cannot, in this legal framework, veto the decision of a competent minor, particularly when that decision is to accept care that promotes her health (Art 24).\n    *   **If Samira is Found Not to Have Capacity:** If she does not demonstrate sufficient understanding to be deemed competent, she cannot give valid consent. However, her clearly expressed wish to proceed still carries significant weight under CRC Article 12 (\"due weight given in accordance with age and maturity\"). Her agreement is sought as **assent**. The decision then defaults to a \"best interests\" determination made by the clinician, in consultation with the parents. This determination must weigh the high clinical benefit of preventive care (Art 24), Samira's strong 'assent' (Art 12), and the parents' objections. Given the strong mandate to protect the child's health, a clinician would be on firm ground to proceed with non-urgent preventive care in the child's best interests, even over parental objections, especially when supported by the patient's assent. Escalation to a court would typically be reserved for situations where withholding care would lead to \"significant harm,\" or for more invasive or risky procedures where the conflict is intractable.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation:** The correct legal-ethical approach is a two-stage process. First, assess Samira's capacity. Second, act based on that assessment: if she is competent, honor her consent; if she is not, seek her assent and act in her best interests, giving significant weight to her health and her own views.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Best interests are determined by parents’ moral and religious preferences; evolving capacities do not apply until age 16, so parental consent is required and Samira’s views carry no legal weight.**\n    This is **Incorrect**. It misrepresents \"best interests\" as being identical to parental preference, which contradicts the holistic nature of the principle. It incorrectly imposes a fixed age of 16, contrary to the concept of \"evolving capacities\" and individualized assessment. It wrongly dismisses the child's views, which are explicitly protected by CRC Article 12.\n\n*   **B. Best interests center on Samira’s welfare, including clinical benefits, risks, and her own views; evolving capacities require assessing Samira’s individual maturity and, if she is demonstrably competent, accepting her valid consent despite parental objection; if she is not competent, the clinician should seek her assent, weigh her views, and proceed in her best interests even where parental preferences conflict, escalating only if refusal poses a risk of significant harm.**\n    This is **Correct**. This option perfectly captures the derived logical flow. It correctly defines \"best interests.\" It mandates the capacity assessment based on \"evolving capacities.\" It correctly distinguishes the two pathways based on the outcome of that assessment (competent -> consent; not competent -> assent + best interests). It accurately reflects the balance of all principles provided in the problem statement.\n\n*   **C. Evolving capacities require always privileging the child’s wishes over any other consideration; parental preferences are irrelevant to best interests, and consent from the child is always sufficient regardless of maturity or risk.**\n    This is **Incorrect**. It creates a standard of absolute autonomy for the child, which is an overstatement. A child's wishes are given \"due weight,\" not absolute privilege. It wrongly states parental preferences are \"irrelevant,\" whereas they are a factor to be considered (Art 5). Most importantly, it incorrectly asserts that a child's \"consent\" is always sufficient, ignoring the crucial prerequisite of a capacity assessment.\n\n*   **D. Best interests are defined solely by clinical judgment; parents have absolute legal authority to decide until age 18, so the clinician must defer to parental refusal unless there is an emergency.**\n    This is **Incorrect**. It describes an outdated paternalistic model. It ignores the child's views (Art 12). It incorrectly posits absolute parental authority until a fixed age of 18, which is directly contradicted by the principles of \"evolving capacities\" and common-law capacity tests. It wrongly limits the clinician's duty to act to \"emergencies\" only.\n\n*   **E. Whenever parents disagree with the child’s wishes, the best interests of the child can only be determined by a court; treatment must not proceed until a judicial order is obtained, regardless of urgency or the child’s maturity.**\n    This is **Incorrect**. This proposes an impractical and legally incorrect process. It makes court intervention mandatory for any disagreement, which is not the case. The clinician is empowered and obligated to make these assessments. It importantly ignores the central role of the child's maturity (capacity), which can make court intervention unnecessary if the minor is competent to consent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4489321"}, {"introduction": "Perhaps the most severe test of a healthcare system's commitment to human rights occurs when life-saving resources are scarce.

It is a substantive reasoning problem, not trivial or tautological.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived by applying the given principles.\n\n### Derivation of a Rights-Consistent Triage Policy\n\nA policy consistent with the given principles must integrate autonomy, equality, and a legitimate aim (beneficence, or saving lives) in a structured, non-arbitrary way.\n\n1.  **Principle of Autonomy:** The foremost consideration is the patient's expressed will. A competent patient's refusal of treatment, including through a valid advance directive, is determinative.\n    -   Mateo has a Do-Not-Intubate (DNI) order. He explicitly refuses invasive ventilation. Therefore, he must be excluded from the pool of candidates for the $2$ ventilators, despite his high probability of survival with the treatment ($0.85$). To force treatment would constitute battery and be a profound violation of his autonomy and dignity.\n\n2.  **Forming the Candidate Pool:** After respecting autonomy, the pool of candidates consists of patients who consent to treatment and require it.\n    -   Noor (Age $35$, P(survival) = $0.80$)\n    -   Sebastian (Age $68$, P(survival) = $0.60$)\n    -   Lila (Age $28$, P(survival) = $0.78$)\n\n3.  **Principle of Equality and Non-Discrimination:** The policy must now rank these candidates without discriminating on prohibited grounds like age or disability. The CRPD is explicit that disability status must not be used as a negative proxy for prognosis. International human rights law permits differential treatment only if it serves a legitimate aim and is proportionate.\n    -   The legitimate aim in this context is maximizing the number of lives saved with a scarce resource.\n    -   The most direct, objective, and non-discriminatory criterion related to this aim is the individualized, evidence-based short-term prognosis (probability of survival to hospital discharge).\n    -   Therefore, criteria such as age, disability status (independent of its effect on short-term prognosis), or perceived social worth are illegitimate grounds for prioritization. Lila must be assessed based on her $0.78$ survival probability, not her disability. Sebastian must be assessed on his $0.60$ survival probability, not his age of $68$.\n\n4.  **Prioritization and Allocation:** Ranking the candidates by their short-term probability of survival with ventilation:\n    1.  Noor: P(survival) = $0.80$\n    2.  Lila: P(survival) = $0.78$\n    3.  Sebastian: P(survival) = $0.60$\n\n    With $2$ ventilators available, they are allocated to the top two candidates on this list.\n    -   Ventilator $1 \\to$ Noor\n    -   Ventilator $2 \\to$ Lila\n\nThis decision-making process is transparent, evidence-based, and respects all the core principles outlined in the problem statement.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Adopt categorical exclusions for persons with significant long-term disabilities and for persons above a fixed age threshold to maximize expected life-years; disregard advance directives when survival odds are high; among the remaining, prefer younger patients in ties.**\nThis policy is fundamentally inconsistent with the provided framework. It explicitly promotes discrimination based on disability and age (\"categorical exclusions\"), which violates the principles of equality, dignity, and the CRPD. It also proposes to \"disregard advance directives,\" which is a direct violation of patient autonomy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Use individualized, evidence-based short-term clinical prognosis to prioritize those with the highest chance of near-term survival conditional on consent; do not consider disability or age except insofar as they demonstrably and objectively affect short-term prognosis; provide reasonable accommodations so that disability-related functional dependence does not depress prognostic scoring; treat a refusal of invasive ventilation as determinative; when prognoses are within a small clinically meaningful margin $\\delta$, allocate by random lottery; document decisions and allow rapid review. In this scenario, allocate ventilators to Noor and Lila; honor Mateo’s DNI.**\nThis policy perfectly aligns with the derived solution. It (i) respects autonomy (\"treat a refusal... as determinative\"), thus correctly handling Mateo's case; (ii) uses a legitimate, non-discriminatory primary criterion (\"individualized... short-term clinical prognosis\"); (iii) explicitly forbids discrimination based on age or disability, in line with the CRPD (\"do not consider disability or age except...\"); and (iv) includes provisions for procedural justice (\"document decisions,\" \"rapid review,\" \"random lottery\"). Its application to the scenario—allocating ventilators to Noor and Lila—is the correct outcome of this rights-consistent process.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Use first-come, first-served to treat everyone “equally” and avoid difficult value judgments; do not inquire about advance directives to prevent delays; avoid prognostic assessments to reduce bias.**\nThis policy fails on multiple grounds. \"First-come, first-served\" is arbitrary and does not align with the medical goal of saving the most lives, potentially leading to tragic misallocations. Critically, it advocates to \"not inquire about advance directives,\" a flagrant violation of patient autonomy. Avoiding prognostic assessment altogether is an abdication of clinical responsibility; the solution to bias is better assessment, not no assessment.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Prioritize those deemed of greater social value (for example, essential workers and parents of minor children) and deprioritize those whose choices increased their risk (for example, unvaccinated individuals); override refusal of invasive ventilation when necessary to save more lives.**\nThis policy is based on judging the \"social value\" of individuals, which violates the fundamental principle of the inherent and equal dignity of all persons. It is explicitly discriminatory. Introducing punitive criteria (\"deprioritize those whose choices increased their risk\") is contrary to the ethos of providing care based on need, not moral judgment. Finally, it proposes to \"override refusal of invasive ventilation,\" a gross violation of autonomy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Rely strictly on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score without any adjustments or accommodations; in ties, prefer younger patients due to expected life-years; disregard advance directives if the patient’s objective survival is high.**\nThis policy contains several fatal flaws. Using any scoring system \"strictly\" and \"without accommodations\" can be discriminatory and may not reflect the individual's prognosis, violating the spirit of the CRPD. Using age as a tie-breaker introduces discrimination. Most significantly, it advocates to \"disregard advance directives,\" which directly violates patient autonomy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4489380"}]}
