This total number is the sum of the indicator variables for all participants in the cohort:\n$$K = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$$\n\nThe expected number of participants with a reportable variant, $E[K]$, can be found using the linearity of expectation. The expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their expectations:\n$$E[K] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]$$\n\nSince $E[X_i] = p$ for every participant $i$, the sum becomes:\n$$E[K] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p = Np$$\n\nThe total cost, let us denote it by $T_{cost}$, is the product of the number of cases, $K$, and the per-case cost, $C$.\n$$T_{cost} = K \\times C$$\n\nWe are asked to find the expected total resource cost, which is $E[T_{cost}]$.\n$$E[T_{cost}] = E[K \\times C]$$\n\nSince $C$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the expectation:\n$$E[T_{cost}] = C \\times E[K]$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $E[K]$:\n$$E[T_{cost}] = C \\times (Np) = NpC$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n- $N = 6000$\n- $p = 0.02$\n- $C = 750$\n\n$$E[T_{cost}] = 6000 \\times 0.02 \\times 750$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the expected number of cases, $E[K] = Np$:\n$$E[K] = 6000 \\times 0.02 = 120$$\nSo, we expect $120$ participants to have a reportable pathogenic variant.\n\nNext, we calculate the expected total cost by multiplying the expected number of cases by the per-case cost:\n$$E[T_{cost}] = 120 \\times 750$$\n$$E[T_{cost}] = 90000$$\n\nThe expected total resource cost for the biobank to return pathogenic variant confirmations to this cohort is $90000$ United States Dollars.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{90000}$$", "id": "4475158"}, {"introduction": "Biobank governance must strike a delicate balance between maximizing the utility of data for research and upholding the stringent privacy protections mandated by regulations like the GDPR.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nLet the set of all equivalence classes in the dataset be $\\mathcal{C} = \\{C_1, C_2, \\dots, C_m\\}$, where $m$ is the total number of classes. The size of an equivalence class $C_i$ is denoted by $|C_i|$. According to the formal definition provided, a dataset is $k$-anonymous if and only if every equivalence class in the dataset contains at least $k$ records. Mathematically, this condition is:\n$$ \\forall C_i \\in \\mathcal{C}, |C_i| \\ge k $$\nThis is equivalent to the condition that the minimum size of any equivalence class in the dataset must be greater than or equal to $k$:\n$$ \\min_{i} |C_i| \\ge k $$\n\nThe problem provides the sizes of all equivalence classes in the dataset. Let $S$ be the set of distinct class sizes. Based on the given distribution, the elements of $S$ are $\\{15, 12, 10, 9, 7, 5, 3\\}$.\n\n**Task 1: Determine $k$-anonymity for $k=10$ and find the maximum $k$.**\n\nFirst, we assess if the dataset satisfies $10$-anonymity. For the dataset to be $10$-anonymous, all equivalence classes must have a size of at least $10$.\nWe examine the given class sizes:\n- Sizes $15$, $12$, and $10$ meet the criterion $|C_i| \\ge 10$.\n- Sizes $9$, $7$, $5$, and $3$ do not meet the criterion, as they are all less than $10$.\nSince there are equivalence classes of sizes $9$, $7$, $5$, and $3$, the condition $\\forall C_i, |C_i| \\ge 10$ is false. Therefore, the dataset is **not** $10$-anonymous.\n\nNext, we calculate the maximum value of $k$, let us call it $k_{max}$, for which the dataset is $k$-anonymous. This value is determined by the size of the smallest equivalence class in the entire dataset.\n$$ k_{max} = \\min_{i} |C_i| $$\nFrom the given list of class sizes, the minimum size is $3$.\n$$ k_{max} = \\min(\\{15, 12, 10, 9, 7, 5, 3\\}) = 3 $$\nThus, the dataset as currently configured is $3$-anonymous, but not $4$-anonymous, as it contains classes of size $3$. The maximum value of $k$ for which the dataset is $k$-anonymous is $3$.\n\n**Task 2: Propose generalization strategies to achieve $k=10$.**\n\nTo achieve $10$-anonymity, it is necessary to modify the dataset such that no equivalence class has fewer than $10$ members. This involves merging the non-compliant equivalence classes (those of size $3, 5, 7,$ and $9$) with each other or with other classes to form new equivalence classes of size $10$ or greater. This is achieved by making the quasi-identifier (QI) values less specific, a process known as generalization. The proposed strategies must be consistent with biobank governance, not alter consent permissions, and minimize information loss.\n\nThe QIs are age, $5$-digit postal code, sex, and consent tier.\n\n**Proposed Generalization Strategies:**\n\n1.  **Generalization of 'Age':** The 'age' attribute is given in single years, which is highly specific. It can be generalized by replacing the exact age with an age interval. A principled approach is to start with minimal information loss.\n    - **Strategy:** Generalize age into $5$-year or $10$-year bins (e.g., $[20-24]$, $[25-29]$, etc.). This would merge records of individuals who differ only by their specific age within that interval into a single, larger equivalence class. The width of the interval can be adjusted to achieve the desired level of anonymity. This is a standard, effective technique that is compatible with governance principles.\n\n2.  **Generalization of 'Postal Code':** The full $5$-digit postal code is a highly distinguishing QI. It can be generalized by truncating it, thereby mapping it to a larger geographical area.\n    - **Strategy:** Truncate the $5$-digit postal code to its first $3$ digits (sectional center facility) or fewer (e.g., first $2$ digits for a larger region). For example, a postal code `90210` could be generalized to `902xx`. This strategy effectively merges individuals from distinct but geographically close neighborhoods, increasing class sizes. This is analogous to age generalization in that the degree of generalization is tunable and governance-compatible.\n\n**Evaluation of Other QIs for Generalization:**\n\n- **'Sex':** This attribute is typically binary (e.g., Male/Female). Generalizing a binary attribute is not meaningful without resorting to suppression (i.e., replacing all values with a token like `*`, effectively removing the attribute from the set of QIs). Suppression of an entire attribute leads to significant information loss and is usually a measure of last resort.\n\n- **'Consent Tier':** The problem states there are three consent tiers and explicitly forbids \"altering the underlying consent permissions.\" Generalizing this attribute by merging different consent tiers (e.g., combining a 'specific disease research' tier with a 'broad unspecified research' tier) is extremely problematic. To remain compliant, any merged class would have to adopt the most restrictive consent permission of its constituent records. This would severely limit the utility of data from participants who had provided broader consent, undermining the purpose of the consent model. Therefore, generalizing the consent-tier attribute is governance-incompatible and should be avoided.\n\n**Recommended Implementation:**\n\nA practical implementation would follow a hierarchical approach to minimize information loss:\n1.  Apply a minimal generalization, such as converting `age` to $5$-year intervals.\n2.  Re-calculate the sizes of the new equivalence classes.\n3.  If $10$-anonymity is not yet achieved, apply a slightly stronger generalization, such as using $3$-digit postal codes or expanding age intervals to $10$ years.\n4.  This iterative process of generalization and re-evaluation should be continued until the $k=10$ criterion is met, using a combination of age and postal code generalization that results in the least overall loss of data specificity. The `sex` and `consent tier` attributes should not be generalized.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "4475186"}]}
