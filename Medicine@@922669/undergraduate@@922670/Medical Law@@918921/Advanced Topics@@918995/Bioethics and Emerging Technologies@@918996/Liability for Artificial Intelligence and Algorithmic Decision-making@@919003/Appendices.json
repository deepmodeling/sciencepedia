The two groups are Group $A$ (AI-only triage) and Group $B$ (AI with physician oversight). The outcomes are \"Missed Diagnosis\" and \"Correct Diagnosis\".\n\nThe total number of cases is $N = 5,000$. The cases are split evenly, so each group has a size of $n_A = n_B = \\frac{5,000}{2} = 2,500$.\n\nFor Group $A$, there were $400$ missed diagnoses. The number of correct diagnoses is therefore $2,500 - 400 = 2,100$.\nFor Group $B$, there were $200$ missed diagnoses.

The problem provides a formal framework for calculating damages under the lost chance doctrine, which is a recognized concept in tort law, particularly in medical malpractice cases. The provided data are self-contained and consistent.\n\nThe problem asks for the calculation of two quantities: the lost chance, denoted as $\\Delta p$, and the corresponding damages award, $D_{\\text{award}}$. We are given the following information:\n- The probability of a cure with timely therapy (the counterfactual scenario without error): $p_{\\text{pre}} = 0.40$.\n- The probability of a cure after the delay caused by the AI error (the actual scenario): $p_{\\text{post}} = 0.25$.\n- The total compensable value of a cure: $D_{\\text{total}} = \\$1,000,000$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the lost chance, $\\Delta p$. The problem statement defines this as the \"reduction in the probability of a favorable outcome\". The favorable outcome is a cure. The probability of this outcome was $p_{\\text{pre}}$ before the error and was reduced to $p_{\\text{post}}$ after the error.
