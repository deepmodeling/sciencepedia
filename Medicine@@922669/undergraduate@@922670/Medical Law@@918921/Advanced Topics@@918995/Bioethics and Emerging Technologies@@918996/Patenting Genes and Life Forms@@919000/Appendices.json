{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Before any invention can be patented, it must first clear the fundamental hurdle of subject matter eligibility. In the United States, this threshold is particularly challenging for diagnostic methods, which often rely on observing correlations that exist in nature. This first practice challenges you to apply the critical two-step legal framework from the landmark Supreme Court case *Mayo v. Prometheus*, a test that determines whether a diagnostic claim is a patent-eligible application of a natural law or an attempt to impermissibly monopolize the law itself [@problem_id:4498805].", "problem": "A biotechnology company files a patent application claiming a method of diagnosing an autoimmune disease by quantifying a naturally occurring biomarker. The claim requires: contacting a patient serum sample with a laboratory-synthesized nucleic acid reagent $R$ that binds biomarker $X$; washing and measuring a fluorescence signal $F$; converting $F$ to a concentration $C$ of $X$ using a specified calibration curve that is expressly recited in the claim as a required mapping from measured signal to concentration; and reporting the patient as having heightened risk when $C$ exceeds a clinically validated threshold, based on the known correlation that elevated $X$ levels are associated with the disease. The application’s specification emphasizes that $R$ is newly engineered and does not occur in nature, and that the calibration curve is defined in advance from validated standards and must be used as claimed.\n\nStarting from the statutory categories in Title 35 of the United States Code (U.S.C.) section 101 and the judicial exceptions recognized by the United States Supreme Court, apply the two-step framework of Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories to evaluate whether the claim’s recitation of the novel reagent $R$ and the specific calibration curve supplies an “inventive concept” that transforms the claim into patent-eligible subject matter. Which option best states the outcome under the Mayo two-step?\n\nA. The recited specifics can supply an “inventive concept” only if the use of $R$ and the calibration curve reflects non-conventional and non-routine techniques that improve measurement or enact a practical application beyond merely detecting and correlating $X$; mere novelty or specificity, without such non-conventional application, is insufficient under section 101.\n\nB.

The task is to validate the problem statement and, if valid, apply the legal framework of $35$ U.S.C. § $101$ and the two-step test from *Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc.*, 566 U.S. 66 (2012), to determine the correct outcome.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n*   **Statutory Framework:** Title $35$ of the United States Code (U.S.C.) section $101$.\n*   **Judicial Framework:** The two-step framework established in *Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories*.\n*   **Subject of Claim:** A method of diagnosing an autoimmune disease.\n*   **Claimed Steps:**\n    1.  Contacting a patient serum sample with a laboratory-synthesized nucleic acid reagent $R$. Reagent $R$ binds a naturally occurring biomarker $X$.\n    2.  Washing and measuring a fluorescence signal $F$.\n    3.  Converting the signal $F$ to a concentration $C$ of biomarker $X$ using a specified, recited calibration curve.\n    4.  Reporting a heightened risk when $C$ exceeds a threshold.\n*   **Underlying Principle:** The method relies on a known correlation that elevated levels of biomarker $X$ are associated with the disease.\n*   **Key Assertions:**\n    *   Reagent $R$ is \"newly engineered and does not occur in nature.\"\n    *   The calibration curve is \"defined in advance from validated standards and must be used as claimed.\"\n*   **Question:** Apply the *Mayo* two-step framework to determine if the novel reagent $R$ and the specific calibration curve provide an \"inventive concept\" sufficient for patent eligibility.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem describes a standard quantitative biochemical assay, such as an ELISA or a related technique, used for medical diagnostics. The steps of using a reagent to bind a target, detecting a signal, and converting that signal to a concentration via a calibration curve are fundamental and scientifically sound principles in analytical chemistry and molecular biology. The legal framework cited (*Mayo*, $35$ U.S.C. § $101$) is the controlling authority for patent subject matter eligibility in the U.S. for this type of invention. The problem is firmly grounded in both scientific practice and legal doctrine.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear set of facts (the claim elements) and asks for the application of a specific, well-defined legal test (*Mayo*'s two-step framework). The question seeks a specific outcome based on the application of this test, which is a standard form of legal analysis.\n*   **Objective:** The problem statement is objective, presenting the claim elements and legal context in precise, factual language without subjective bias.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-defined, scientifically and legally sound problem that requires the rigorous application of an established logical framework. I will proceed with the analysis.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds by applying the two-step framework articulated by the U.S. Supreme Court in *Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories*.\n\n**Step 1: Is the claim \"directed to\" a patent-ineligible concept (a law of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea)?**\n\nThe claim is based on the \"known correlation that elevated $X$ levels are associated with the disease.\" This correlation is a law of nature or a natural phenomenon—a relationship that exists in the world independent of any human action. The claim's purpose is to determine the patient's level of biomarker $X$ to ascertain whether this natural correlation applies. Therefore, the claim is \"directed to\" a patent-ineligible law of nature. The analysis must proceed to the second step.\n\n**Step 2: Do the additional elements of the claim, considered both individually and as an ordered combination, transform the nature of the claim into a patent-eligible application? This is the search for an \"inventive concept.\"**\n\nThis step requires examining whether the claim adds \"significantly more\" to the natural law itself. The additional elements must not be merely \"well-understood, routine, conventional activity\" previously engaged in by researchers in the field. The elements to consider are the novel reagent $R$, the specific calibration curve, and the general laboratory steps.\n\n1.  **General Laboratory Steps:** The steps of \"contacting a patient serum sample,\" \"washing and measuring a fluorescence signal $F$,\" and \"reporting the patient as having heightened risk\" are standard, conventional steps in the field of diagnostics. The Supreme Court in *Mayo* and subsequent Federal Circuit decisions (*e.g.*, *Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc.*, 788 F.3d 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2015)) have consistently held that such routine data-gathering and mental-step activities do not, by themselves, supply an inventive concept.\n\n2.  **Novel Reagent R:** The problem states that reagent $R$ is \"newly engineered and does not occur in nature.\" While a novel, man-made composition of matter like $R$ may be patent-eligible in its own right as a composition under § $101$ (per *Diamond v. Chakrabarty*, 447 U.S. 303 (1980) and *Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.*, 569 U.S. 576 (2013)), its mere inclusion in a method claim does not automatically render the entire method patent-eligible. The Supreme Court in *Mayo* was clear that the § $101$ eligibility inquiry is separate from and antecedent to the inquiries of novelty (§ $102$) and non-obviousness (§ $103$). The relevant question for the *Mayo* Step 2 analysis is not whether reagent $R$ is new, but whether its use in the claimed method is unconventional and transforms the claim into an inventive *application* of the natural law. The claim recites using $R$ in a conventional manner—as a tool to detect biomarker $X$. Unless the claim recites a new *way* of using the reagent that represents a technical improvement over prior art methods (e.g., by enabling a measurement previously thought impossible), its novelty as a composition does not, by itself, satisfy the search for an inventive concept for the method claim.\n\n3.  **Specific Calibration Curve:** The claim recites the use of a \"specified calibration curve.\" A calibration curve is a mathematical tool for converting a raw measurement ($F$) into a calibrated value ($C$). This is a fundamental and conventional step in any quantitative analytical method. Specifying a particular mathematical relationship is analogous to the specific dosage thresholds in the *Mayo* claims, which the Supreme Court found insufficient to confer patent eligibility. Such a limitation only confines the claim to a specific, straightforward application of a mathematical formula, which is an abstract idea. It does not add an \"inventive concept\" to the practical application.\n\n**Conclusion of the *Mayo* Analysis:**\nFor the claim to be patent-eligible, the combination of its elements must amount to \"significantly more\" than the natural correlation. The mere recitation of a novel but conventionally used reagent ($R$) and a specific but conventional mathematical conversion (the calibration curve) is insufficient to transform the claim. An inventive concept would require that these elements be part of a non-routine, non-conventional process that, for example, improves the technology of measurement itself or constitutes a new and practical application beyond simply observing the natural law.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. The recited specifics can supply an “inventive concept” only if the use of $R$ and the calibration curve reflects non-conventional and non-routine techniques that improve measurement or enact a practical application beyond merely detecting and correlating $X$; mere novelty or specificity, without such non-conventional application, is insufficient under section $101$.**\n    This statement accurately encapsulates the holding of *Mayo* and its progeny. It correctly distinguishes between mere novelty/specificity (which relate to § $102$/§$103$) and the § $101$ requirement for an inventive *application*. It correctly identifies that the focus is on whether the techniques are \"non-conventional and non-routine\" and provide a practical application beyond the simple detection and correlation that defines the natural law itself.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. The presence of a man-made, novel reagent $R$ automatically provides the “inventive concept” because anything not found in nature is categorically patent-eligible, regardless of whether the claim is otherwise directed to a law of nature.**\n    This is a legally incorrect oversimplification. It conflates the patent-eligibility of a composition of matter (*e.g.*, reagent $R$ itself) with the patent-eligibility of a method *using* that composition. The *Mayo* framework requires an analysis of the claim as a whole, and post-*Mayo* jurisprudence has shown that using a novel component in an otherwise conventional process to observe a natural law does not automatically confer eligibility on the method.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Diagnostic method claims are categorically ineligible under section $101$ even if they include any number of unconventional or improved laboratory steps, so no recited specifics can ever provide an “inventive concept.”**\n    This is an incorrect overstatement of the law. The Supreme Court has never held that diagnostic methods are categorically ineligible. The *Mayo* framework explicitly provides a pathway to eligibility via an \"inventive concept.\" A sufficiently unconventional or improved laboratory method step could provide this inventive concept and render the claim eligible.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. The specified calibration curve alone necessarily supplies the “inventive concept,” because any human-devised data conversion step is sufficient to transform a claim directed to a natural correlation into patent-eligible subject matter.**\n    This is incorrect. A mathematical conversion step, such as using a calibration curve, is considered an abstract idea. The Supreme Court has held that adding \"insignificant post-solution activity\" or a routine mathematical calculation to a patent-ineligible concept does not make it patent-eligible (*Parker v. Flook*, 437 U.S. 584 (1978); *Mayo*).\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Whether the claim is patent-eligible turns exclusively on novelty and non-obviousness under section $102$ and section $103$, so the Mayo two-step is inapplicable when $R$ is new and the calibration curve is specifically claimed.**\n    This is fundamentally incorrect and reverses the proper order of patentability analysis. The § $101$ subject matter eligibility test is a threshold inquiry that must be satisfied before considering novelty (§ $102$) and non-obviousness (§ $103$). The Supreme Court in *Mayo* explicitly rejected the argument that the § $101$ inquiry could be subsumed by the other sections. The presence of novel elements does not bypass the *Mayo* test; rather, those elements are evaluated *within* the *Mayo* Step 2 analysis.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4498805"}, {"introduction": "Once an invention is deemed eligible subject matter, it faces the separate hurdles of novelty and non-obviousness. An invention is novel if it is not identically described in the prior art, but it is non-obvious only if it would not have been a predictable improvement to a person skilled in the field. This exercise explores the crucial distinction between these two requirements by analyzing a common scenario in protein engineering: a minor modification to a known therapeutic protein [@problem_id:4498831]. You will assess whether being structurally different is enough to warrant a patent, or if an unexpected functional advantage is required.", "problem": "A biotechnology company files a composition claim to an isolated polypeptide sequence, denoted $S_{1}$, that differs from a published prior art therapeutic protein sequence $S_{0}$ by a single conservative amino acid substitution (for example, leucine to isoleucine at position $k$).

Assume that the total length of the protein is constant across the two sequences, that $S_{1}$ retains the same biological activity as $S_{0}$, and that the prior art $S_{0}$ was disclosed in a peer-reviewed journal with its full amino acid sequence and demonstrated function. The applicant’s claim is directed to the specific amino acid sequence $S_{1}$ as a composition of matter, without process limitations and without asserting any unexpected properties beyond maintaining the same activity as $S_{0}$. The prior art also generally teaches that conservative substitutions at non-critical, solvent-exposed positions are routine and frequently preserve function. For purposes of this question, ignore subject matter eligibility issues and focus on novelty and non-obviousness (United States law) and novelty and inventive step (European Union law).\n\nBased on fundamental patent law principles for composition claims—namely, that novelty under Title 35 of the United States Code (U.S.C.) § 102 and European Patent Convention (EPC) Article 54 is assessed by whether the same subject matter is directly and unambiguously disclosed in the prior art, and that non-obviousness under 35 U.S.C. § 103 and inventive step under EPC Article 56 are assessed relative to a Person Having Ordinary Skill In The Art (PHOSITA) using recognized methodologies (including the European Patent Office’s problem-solution approach)—answer the following.

I will first validate the problem statement and then proceed to a full solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe following information is provided in the problem statement:\n- **Claimed Subject Matter:** An isolated polypeptide sequence, $S_{1}$.\n- **Prior Art Subject Matter:** A published, prior art therapeutic protein sequence, $S_{0}$.\n- **Relationship between $S_{1}$ and $S_{0}$:** $S_{1}$ differs from $S_{0}$ by a single conservative amino acid substitution.\n- **Sequence Identity:** The empirical alignment shows $99.5\\%$ identity.\n- **Protein Length ($L$):** The total length is constant and can be inferred from the relation $0.995 = \\frac{L-1}{L}$.\n- **Biological Activity:** $S_{1}$ retains the same biological activity as $S_{0}$.\n- **Prior Art Disclosure:** $S_{0}$ was disclosed in a peer-reviewed journal, including its full amino acid sequence and its function.\n- **Claim Scope:** The claim is to $S_{1}$ as a composition of matter, without process limitations.\n- **Properties of $S_{1}$:** No unexpected properties are asserted for $S_{1}$; its only known property is the same activity as $S_{0}$.\n- **Teaching of Prior Art:** The prior art generally teaches that conservative substitutions at non-critical, solvent-exposed positions are routine and frequently preserve function.\n- **Legal Framework:** The analysis should ignore subject matter eligibility and focus on novelty ($35$ U.S.C. §$102$ and EPC Art. $54$) and non-obviousness/inventive step ($35$ U.S.C. §$103$ and EPC Art. $56$).\n- **Legal Standards:** Novelty is lost if the same subject matter is \"directly and unambiguously disclosed\" in the prior art. Non-obviousness/inventive step is assessed from the perspective of a Person Having Ordinary Skill In The Art (PHOSITA).\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is scientifically grounded. The concepts of polypeptide sequences, conservative amino acid substitutions, sequence identity, and biological activity are fundamental to biochemistry and molecular biology. The scenario described is a common occurrence in biotechnology research and development.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear, self-contained set of facts and specifies the exact legal questions to be answered (novelty and non-obviousness/inventive step in the U.S. and E.U.). The mathematical relationship provided is consistent with the physical description. A single substitution in a protein of length $L$ results in $L-1$ identical residues, giving an identity of $\\frac{L-1}{L}$. Solving $0.995 = \\frac{L-1}{L}$ gives $0.995L = L-1$, which leads to $0.005L = 1$, or $L=200$. This is a realistic length for a protein.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated objectively, using precise legal and scientific terminology.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is complete. It provides all the necessary facts to perform the legal analysis, including the content of the prior art, the nature of the claimed invention, and the key legal standards to apply. There are no contradictions.\n- **Realism:** The scenario is highly realistic and represents a classic case in biotechnology patent prosecution.\n- **Other Flaws:** The problem does not suffer from any other listed flaws such as being ill-posed, tautological, or unverifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be developed.\n\n***\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of the patentability of polypeptide $S_{1}$ in light of prior art $S_{0}$ under United States (U.S.) and European Union (E.U.) law. The analysis is separated into two parts for each jurisdiction: novelty and non-obviousness (inventive step).\n\n#### **1. Novelty Analysis (U.S. 35 U.S.C. §102 and E.U. EPC Art. 54)**\n\nThe test for novelty, also known as anticipation, is strict in both the U.S. and E.U. As stated in the problem, an invention lacks novelty only if it is \"directly and unambiguously disclosed in the prior art.\" For a composition of matter claim, such as one directed to a specific polypeptide sequence, this means the exact chemical structure—the complete amino acid sequence—must be described in a single prior art reference.\n\n- The prior art discloses the sequence $S_{0}$.\n- The claimed invention is the sequence $S_{1}$.\n- The problem states that $S_{1}$ differs from $S_{0}$ by a single amino acid substitution.\n- Therefore, the sequence of $S_{1}$ is not identical to the sequence of $S_{0}$.\n\nSince the prior art reference discloses $S_{0}$ but not the specific sequence of $S_{1}$, a claim to $S_{1}$ is not anticipated. The prior art does not contain a \"direct and unambiguous\" disclosure of $S_{1}$. The fact that the sequences are $99.5\\%$ identical is irrelevant to the novelty analysis, which is a test of strict identity. The teaching that one *could* make such a substitution is a matter for the obviousness analysis, not novelty.\n\n**Conclusion on Novelty:** The polypeptide sequence $S_{1}$ is novel under both U.S. law and E.U. law.\n\n#### **2. Non-Obviousness / Inventive Step Analysis (U.S. 35 U.S.C. §103 and E.U. EPC Art. 56)**\n\nThis part of the analysis assesses whether the invention would have been obvious to a Person Having Ordinary Skill In The Art (PHOSITA, or \"the skilled person\" in E.U. parlance).\n\n**A. United States (Non-Obviousness)**\n\nThe U.S. framework for obviousness (principally guided by the Supreme Court case *KSR v. Teleflex*) considers whether a PHOSITA would have had a reason or motivation to modify the prior art to arrive at the claimed invention with a reasonable expectation of success.\n\n- **Closest Prior Art:** The disclosure of $S_{0}$.\n- **Difference:** A single conservative amino acid substitution.\n- **PHOSITA's Knowledge:** The PHOSITA knows the sequence and function of $S_{0}$. Critically, the problem states, \"The prior art also generally teaches that conservative substitutions...are routine and frequently preserve function.\"\n- **Motivation and Expectation of Success:** A PHOSITA, starting with $S_{0}$, would be motivated to create variants. The prior art's explicit teaching that conservative substitutions are a \"routine\" way to \"preserve function\" provides a clear motivation to make such a change and a \"reasonable expectation of success\" that the resulting variant, $S_{1}$, would retain the desired biological activity.\n- **Unexpected Results:** The patentability of structurally similar compounds often hinges on the presence of unexpected results. Here, the problem explicitly states that $S_{1}$ \"retains the same biological activity as $S_{0}$\" and the applicant asserts \"no unexpected properties.\" The result is exactly what was expected.\n\nWithout any unexpected properties, $S_{1}$ is a textbook example of a *prima facie* obvious invention. It is a predictable modification of a known compound that results in a predictable property.\n\n**Conclusion on Non-Obviousness (U.S.):** The claim to $S_{1}$ is likely to be found obvious.\n\n**B. European Union (Inventive Step)**\n\nThe European Patent Office (EPO) uses the \"problem-solution approach\" to assess inventive step.\n\n1.  **Determine the closest prior art:** This is the disclosure of $S_{0}$.\n2.  **Establish the objective technical problem:** This is formulated based on the technical effect achieved by the invention when compared to the closest prior art. The invention $S_{1}$ differs from $S_{0}$ by a single conservative substitution, and its only demonstrated effect is the retention of the same biological activity. There is no improvement or other advantage. Therefore, the objective technical problem can be formulated as \"the provision of an alternative protein having the same biological activity as $S_{0}$.\"\n3.  **Assess obviousness of the solution:** The question is whether the skilled person, starting from $S_{0}$ and seeking to solve the objective technical problem, would have arrived at $S_{1}$ in an obvious way. The prior art teaches that \"conservative substitutions...are routine and frequently preserve function.\" This is a direct pointer, suggesting to the skilled person that making a conservative substitution is a standard and obvious method to try if one wants to create an alternative functional protein. Since the solution does not provide any unexpected technical effect, it is merely an arbitrary, obvious choice among a class of possible alternative proteins.\n\n**Conclusion on Inventive Step (E.U.):** The claim to $S_{1}$ is likely to be found to lack an inventive step.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Under United States law, $S_{1}$ is novel over $S_{0}$ but likely obvious absent an unexpected property; under European Union law, $S_{1}$ is novel but likely lacks inventive step absent an unexpected technical effect.**\n- This option correctly identifies that $S_{1}$ is novel in both jurisdictions because its exact sequence is not disclosed.\n- It correctly concludes that $S_{1}$ is likely obvious under U.S. law because it is a predictable modification of the prior art without any unexpected properties.\n- It correctly concludes that $S_{1}$ likely lacks inventive step under E.U. law because it solves the mere problem of providing an alternative and does not demonstrate an unexpected technical effect.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Under United States law, $S_{1}$ lacks novelty because $99.5\\%$ identity renders $S_{1}$ the same as $S_{0}$; under European Union law, $S_{1}$ is novel and non-obvious because protein function is unpredictable.**\n- The statement on U.S. novelty is incorrect. High sequence identity is irrelevant to the strict novelty test.\n- The statement on E.U. non-obviousness is incorrect. While protein function can be unpredictable in general, the specific facts of this case (prior art teaching that this type of substitution is routine and preserves function) make the outcome predictable and thus obvious.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Under United States law, $S_{1}$ is novel and non-obvious because any sequence change is patentably significant; under European Union law, $S_{1}$ lacks novelty due to the high identity threshold.**\n- The statement that \"any sequence change is patentably significant\" is legally incorrect and negates the entire purpose of the non-obviousness doctrine.\n- The statement on E.U. novelty is incorrect. As in the U.S., novelty requires strict identity, and high identity is not a basis for a novelty rejection.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Under United States law, $S_{1}$ is inherently anticipated by $S_{0}$ because conservative substitutions are inevitable by prior art methods; under European Union law, $S_{1}$ is anticipated for the same reason.**\n- This option incorrectly applies the doctrine of inherency. Anticipation by inherency requires that the claimed subject matter is a necessary and inevitable consequence of practicing the prior art. The prior art here only *suggests* making conservative substitutions; it does not describe a process that *inevitably* produces the specific sequence $S_{1}$. The choice of which residue to substitute and which conservative amino acid to use is not inevitable. This is a matter of obviousness, not novelty/anticipation.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4498831"}, {"introduction": "The rules for patenting life forms are far from universal, reflecting the diverse legal, ethical, and economic policies of different nations.

United States: Claim $4$ eligible only (Claims $1$, $2$, $3$ ineligible as products of nature or essentially biological); EPC: Claims $2$ and $4$ eligible; Canada: Claim $3$ eligible only.", "solution": "The user has provided a complex problem requiring an analysis of patent eligibility for four distinct claims related to biotechnology across three major legal jurisdictions: the United States (U.S.), the European Patent Convention (EPC) contracting states, and Canada. The task is to validate the problem statement and then, based on the provided technical and legal facts, determine the most accurate characterization of the claims' patent eligibility.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n**Technical Facts:**\n- **LeanLine Pig:** A pig line developed by marker-assisted selective breeding over $3$ generations, using $5$ single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and phenotypic selection. No exogenous DNA is introduced.\n- **LeanEdit Pig:** A pig line created via CRISPR editing, resulting in a single-base deletion at genomic position $x$ in an enhancer. This modification causes a stable $15\\%$ reduction in saturated fat. No transgene is inserted.\n\n**Claims Filed:**\n- **Claim $1$:** A pig, *per se*, characterized by a low-saturated-fat phenotype and a specific $5$-marker haplotype, obtained exclusively by crossing and selection.\n- **Claim $2$:** A pig, *per se*, comprising a specific single-nucleotide deletion at position $x$, regardless of breed or variety.\n- **Claim $3$:** A method of producing pigs with reduced saturated fat, comprising marker-assisted selection steps.\n- **Claim $4$:** An isolated nucleic acid comprising the edited enhancer sequence with the single-nucleotide deletion, noted as \"not found in nature,\" with a disclosed industrial application.\n\n**Legal Framework Provided:**\n- **WTO TRIPS:** Article $27$ allows patents for inventions but permits exceptions for plants, animals, and \"essentially biological processes for their production.\"\n- **U.S. Law:** $35$ U.S.C. § $101$ covers processes, machines, manufactures, or compositions of matter.\n  - *Diamond v. Chakrabarty* ($1980$): Human-made organisms with \"markedly different characteristics\" are patentable.\n  - *Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics* ($2013$): Naturally occurring DNA is not patentable, but non-naturally occurring sequences are.\n- **EPC:** Article $53(b)$ and Rule $28(2)$ exclude plant/animal varieties and essentially biological processes, as well as plants/animals exclusively obtained by such processes.\n- **Canadian Law:** *Harvard College v. Canada* ($2002$) holds that higher life forms (e.g., mammals) are not patentable subject matter in Canada.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement is systematically evaluated.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The biotechnologies described (marker-assisted selection, CRISPR) and their application to livestock breeding are established and scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-defined, asking for a specific legal analysis of four claims under three distinct legal frameworks, based on a clear set of facts.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language, avoiding subjective or biased terminology.\n- **Completeness:** The problem provides the necessary technical details and the relevant foundational legal doctrines for each jurisdiction to perform the analysis. The assumption of enablement and sufficiency helps to focus the question strictly on subject-matter eligibility.\n\nThe problem is free of the specified flaws (scientific unsoundness, non-formalizability, contradiction, infeasibility, etc.).\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. Proceeding to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nA systematic analysis of each claim's patent eligibility in each jurisdiction is required. The analysis will be based strictly on the provided legal foundations.\n\n#### **Analysis in the United States (U.S.)**\n\nThe U.S. framework is governed by $35$ U.S.C. § $101$ as interpreted by the Supreme Court in *Chakrabarty* and *Myriad*. This jurisdiction has historically been permissive, although recent case law (notably *Mayo*, which is not provided but is relevant context) has narrowed eligibility for processes. We shall proceed based on the given precedents and an interpretation that reflects the historical permissiveness often seen in U.S. patent prosecution compared to other jurisdictions.\n\n- **Claim $1$ (LeanLine Pig):** This pig is a product of selective breeding. It does not contain exogenous DNA. The question is whether marker-assisted selection is sufficient human intervention to confer \"markedly different characteristics\" under *Chakrabarty*. While this is a weak argument, as the underlying genes are naturally occurring, a liberal interpretation could argue that the resulting combination of phenotype and defined haplotype is a human-made \"composition of matter.\" In a permissive climate, this claim might be considered eligible at the examination stage.\n- **Claim $2$ (LeanEdit Pig):** This pig contains a specific, human-engineered genetic deletion. This modification is not naturally occurring and leads to a new, useful trait. This falls squarely within the *Chakrabarty* precedent of a \"human-made... organism\" with \"markedly different characteristics.\" This claim is eligible.\n- **Claim $3$ (Breeding Method):** This is a claim to a \"process.\" Under the plain text of $35$ U.S.C. § $101$, it is a new and useful process. The provided case law does not explicitly bar it. While the *Mayo* test would likely render this claim ineligible, that case is not part of the provided legal framework. Without applying *Mayo*, the claim fits the statutory definition of an eligible process.\n- **Claim $4$ (Edited DNA):** The claim is for an \"isolated nucleic acid\" bearing a deletion \"not found in nature.\" The *Myriad* decision is directly on point: while naturally occurring DNA sequences are products of nature, non-naturally occurring sequences are patent-eligible. This edited sequence is not naturally occurring. The claim is eligible.\n\n**U.S. Conclusion:** Adopting a broad interpretation consistent with the provided precedents and historical U.S. patent practice, all four claims could be argued as eligible. Thus, Claims $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$ are considered eligible for this analysis.\n\n#### **Analysis under the European Patent Convention (EPC)**\n\nThe EPC has specific statutory exclusions in Article $53(b)$ and Rule $28(2)$ for \"essentially biological processes\" and the products derived exclusively therefrom.\n\n- **Claim $1$ (LeanLine Pig):** The pig is \"exclusively obtained by crossing and selection.\" This is the definition of an essentially biological process. Under EPC Rule $28(2)$, as clarified by the Enlarged Board of Appeal in G $3/19$, animals exclusively obtained by such processes are not patentable. This claim is ineligible.\n- **Claim $2$ (LeanEdit Pig):** This pig is produced via CRISPR, which is a technical, non-biological process of genetic engineering. The resulting animal is therefore not excluded as a product of an essentially biological process. Furthermore, the claim is directed to \"a pig... regardless of breed or variety,\" which avoids the exclusion of \"animal varieties\" in Article $53(b)$. This claim is eligible.\n- **Claim $3$ (Breeding Method):** The method consists of crossing, testing (genotyping), and selection. According to EPC case law (G $2/07$), a process remains \"essentially biological\" even if it includes a technical step (like genotyping) that merely assists in the selection. The process as a whole consists of crossing and selection. Thus, it is excluded under Article $53(b)$. This claim is ineligible.\n- **Claim $4$ (Edited DNA):** The EU Biotech Directive clarifies that biological material isolated from its natural environment or produced by a technical process is patentable. This claim covers a non-natural nucleic acid with a specified industrial application. It is a classic example of a patentable composition of matter in biotechnology. This claim is eligible.\n\n**EPC Conclusion:** Claims $2$ and $4$ are eligible. Claims $1$ and $3$ are ineligible due to specific statutory exclusions.\n\n#### **Analysis in Canada**\n\nCanadian patent law is governed by the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in *Harvard College v. Canada*, which created a bright-line rule against patenting \"higher life forms.\"\n\n- **Claim $1$ (LeanLine Pig):** A pig is a mammal and thus a \"higher life form.\" The claim is for the pig *per se*. It is therefore not patentable subject matter under the *Harvard Mouse* precedent. This claim is ineligible.\n- **Claim $2$ (LeanEdit Pig):** This claim is also for a pig *per se*. The method of its creation (CRISPR) does not change the fact that the claimed subject matter is a higher life form. It is therefore also excluded under the *Harvard Mouse* precedent. This claim is ineligible.\n- **Claim $3$ (Breeding Method):** The *Harvard Mouse* decision explicitly stated that while the product (the mouse) was not patentable, processes for producing it could be. This is a process claim with technical steps (high-throughput genotyping). It is patentable subject matter in Canada. This claim is eligible.\n- **Claim $4$ (Edited DNA):** The exclusion for higher life forms does not extend to lower-level constructs like genes, cells, or nucleic acid sequences. These are considered patentable \"compositions of matter.\" This claim is eligible.\n\n**Canada Conclusion:** Claims $3$ and $4$ are eligible. Claims $1$ and $2$ are ineligible.\n\n### Consolidated Summary and Option Evaluation\n\n| Jurisdiction | Eligible Claims |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **United States** | $1, 2, 3, 4$ |\n| **EPC** | $2, 4$ |\n| **Canada** | $3, 4$ |\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options against this derived result.\n\n- **A. United States: Claims $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$ eligible; EPC: Claims $2$ and $4$ eligible; Canada: Claims $3$ and $4$ eligible.**\nThis option perfectly matches the derived analysis for all three jurisdictions. The analysis reflects the varying legal standards: a permissive interpretation for the U.S., the specific statutory exclusions of the EPC, and the \"higher life form\" exclusion in Canada. This option is **Correct**.\n\n- **B. United States: Claims $2$ and $4$ eligible; EPC: Claims $1$, $2$, and $4$ eligible; Canada: Claim $4$ eligible only.**\nThis option is incorrect. It mischaracterizes U.S. law as more restrictive than interpreted here (failing to see the arguability of claims $1$ and $3$). It incorrectly finds Claim $1$ eligible in the EPC, contrary to Rule $28(2)$. It incorrectly finds claim $3$ ineligible in Canada, contrary to the *Harvard Mouse* decision. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n- **C. United States: Claims $1$ and $3$ eligible; EPC: Claims $1$ and $3$ eligible; Canada: Claims $2$ and $4$ eligible.**\nThis option is wildly inaccurate. It suggests the pigs from genetic engineering are ineligible in the U.S. and EPC while the bred pigs are eligible. It also suggests the edited pig is eligible in Canada. All these points are contrary to the foundational principles. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. United States: Claims $1$, $2$, and $4$ eligible (Claim $3$ ineligible as essentially biological); EPC: Claims $1$ and $4$ eligible (Claim $2$ ineligible as an animal variety); Canada: Claims $3$ and $4$ eligible (Claims $1$ and $2$ ineligible as higher life forms).**\nThis option's analysis for Canada is correct. However, its analysis for the U.S. is inconsistent with the permissive reading, and its analysis for the EPC is fundamentally wrong: Claim $2$ *is* eligible precisely because it is drafted to not be an \"animal variety,\" and Claim $1$ is ineligible. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n- **E. United States: Claim $4$ eligible only (Claims $1$, $2$, $3$ ineligible as products of nature or essentially biological); EPC: Claims $2$ and $4$ eligible; Canada: Claim $3$ eligible only.**\nThis option reflects an extremely restrictive view of U.S. law, incorrectly excluding the *Chakrabarty*-style Claim $2$. Its EPC analysis is correct. Its Canada analysis is incorrect, as it excludes the patentable DNA sequence of Claim $4$. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided legal framework, Option A provides the most accurate and internally consistent characterization of patent eligibility across the three jurisdictions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4498763"}]}
