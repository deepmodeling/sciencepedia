This practice exercise introduces the critical contract law distinctions between agreements that are `void`, `voidable`, and `unenforceable`, applying them to common scenarios in surrogacy. Mastering these classifications is the first step in analyzing the rights and obligations of intended parents and surrogates. [@problem_id:4474178]", "problem": "In a hypothetical common-law jurisdiction, courts apply general contract principles to agreements arising from Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART), including In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and gestational surrogacy. Under these principles, a contract is void if its primary purpose violates a statute or fundamental public policy, voidable if a valid contract is formed but a party’s consent or capacity defect allows that party to rescind, and unenforceable if statutory formalities are unsatisfied such that courts will not grant specific performance or damages, though the agreement is not illegal per se. Consider the following $3$ surrogacy scenarios, each evaluated at the time of execution and prior to any judicial parentage orders:\n\nScenario I: Intended parents and a surrogate sign a written agreement providing a lump-sum payment of $50{,}000$ to the surrogate for carrying the pregnancy, in a jurisdiction where a clear statute prohibits commercial surrogacy compensation beyond documented reasonable expenses. The agreement’s central bargain is the prohibited payment, and the parties intend to proceed without seeking judicial modification or severance.\n\nScenario II: Intended parents and a surrogate enter an altruistic surrogacy agreement (no compensation beyond documented expenses) in a jurisdiction that requires independent legal advice for both parties and judicial pre-approval before embryo transfer. They intentionally skip independent legal advice and do not seek court approval, and attempt to compel performance after IVF embryos are created but before transfer.\n\nScenario III: A prospective surrogate, aged $17$ and not legally emancipated, signs a standard gestational surrogacy agreement without a guardian’s consent. The jurisdiction follows general contract capacity rules for minors and does not classify surrogacy as a contract for “necessaries.”\n\nWhich option correctly classifies Scenarios I–III, respectively, using the categories void, voidable, and unenforceable?\n\nA.

Scenario I: voidable; Scenario II: unenforceable; Scenario III: void\n\nD. Scenario I: void; Scenario II: void; Scenario III: unenforceable", "solution": "The problem statement provides a set of legal definitions and three scenarios, asking for the correct legal classification of each scenario based on the provided definitions. The problem is self-contained, logically consistent, and well-posed. The scenarios are grounded in established legal concepts of contract law. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem defines three categories for classifying agreements:\n1.  **Void**: An agreement is void if its primary purpose violates a statute or fundamental public policy.\n2.  **Voidable**: A valid contract is formed, but a defect in a party's consent or capacity allows that party to rescind the agreement.\n3.  **Unenforceable**: An agreement for which statutory formalities are not satisfied, preventing courts from granting remedies like specific performance or damages, even though the agreement is not illegal per se.\n\nWe will now analyze each of the $3$ scenarios based on these definitions.\n\n**Scenario I Analysis**\nThe agreement involves a lump-sum payment of $\\$50,000$ to the surrogate. This takes place in a jurisdiction where a statute explicitly \"prohibits commercial surrogacy compensation beyond documented reasonable expenses.\" The problem states that this prohibited payment constitutes the \"central bargain\" of the agreement.\n\nAccording to the provided definitions, a contract is **void** if its \"primary purpose violates a statute.\" The primary purpose of this agreement, its central bargain, is the commercial payment, which is expressly forbidden by statute. Therefore, the agreement is illegal at its core and is a nullity from its inception. It is not merely a matter of a procedural defect (unenforceable) or a party's capacity (voidable).\n\nConclusion for Scenario I: The agreement is **void**.\n\n**Scenario II Analysis**\nThe agreement is for altruistic surrogacy, which is not stated to be illegal. However, the jurisdiction imposes two mandatory \"statutory formalities\": independent legal advice for both parties and judicial pre-approval before embryo transfer. The parties have intentionally failed to comply with these requirements. They are attempting to \"compel performance.\"\n\nThe definition of an **unenforceable** contract is one where \"statutory formalities are unsatisfied such that courts will not grant specific performance or damages, though the agreement is not illegal per se.\" This definition perfectly describes the situation in Scenario II. The underlying purpose (altruistic surrogacy) is not illegal, but the failure to adhere to the required statutory procedures (formalities) renders it unenforceable. A court would refuse the parties' attempt to compel performance. The agreement is not void because its substance is legal, and it is not voidable because there is no issue of consent or capacity.\n\nConclusion for Scenario II: The agreement is **unenforceable**.\n\n**Scenario III Analysis**\nA prospective surrogate, aged $17$ and not legally emancipated, signs the agreement. The jurisdiction adheres to \"general contract capacity rules for minors\" and does not consider surrogacy a contract for \"necessaries.\"\n\nThe definition of a **voidable** contract is one where \"a party’s consent or capacity defect allows that party to rescind.\" Under general common law principles, contracts entered into by a minor (a person under the age of majority, here $17$ years old) are not automatically void. Instead, the minor has a \"capacity defect,\" which gives them the power to either honor the contract or to disaffirm (rescind) it. This makes the contract voidable at the option of the minor. The problem explicitly directs us to apply these general rules.\n\nThe agreement is not void because it is not illegal in its purpose. It is not unenforceable due to a procedural flaw; the issue is the inherent legal status of one of the parties. Therefore, the contract is voidable by the $17$-year-old surrogate.\n\nConclusion for Scenario III: The agreement is **voidable**.\n\n**Summary and Option Evaluation**\nBased on the analysis:\n- Scenario I is **void**.\n- Scenario II is **unenforceable**.\n- Scenario III is **voidable**.\n\nWe now evaluate the given options:\n\n**A. Scenario I: void; Scenario II: unenforceable; Scenario III: voidable**\nThis option aligns perfectly with our derived classifications for all three scenarios. This option is **Correct**.\n\n**B. Scenario I: unenforceable; Scenario II: void; Scenario III: voidable**\nThis option incorrectly classifies Scenario I as unenforceable (it is void) and Scenario II as void (it is unenforceable). This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Scenario I: voidable; Scenario II: unenforceable; Scenario III: void**\nThis option incorrectly classifies Scenario I as voidable (it is void) and Scenario III as void (it is voidable). This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Scenario I: void; Scenario II: void; Scenario III: unenforceable**\nThis option incorrectly classifies Scenario II as void (it is unenforceable) and Scenario III as unenforceable (it is voidable). This option is **Incorrect**.\n\nThe only option that correctly classifies all three scenarios is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4474178"}, {"introduction": "Legal practice often involves navigating detailed statutory frameworks rather than relying on general principles alone. This problem presents a hypothetical but realistic surrogacy act and asks you to trace the legal consequences for a specific arrangement, from its initial classification to the ultimate pathway for establishing parentage. This develops the core legal skill of statutory interpretation in the rapidly evolving field of ART law. [@problem_id:4474330]", "problem": "A jurisdiction enacts the Northshire Surrogacy Act, which provides the following baseline legal framework: (i) commercial surrogacy agreements that include compensation beyond documented pregnancy-related expenses are void as against public policy, (ii) altruistic arrangements that limit payments to documented pregnancy-related expense reimbursements are permitted, (iii) courts may issue a parentage order only after birth, contingent on the surrogate’s consent, a best-interests-of-the-child analysis, and the presence of a genetic link between at least one intended parent and the child; if there is no genetic link, intended parents must proceed by adoption; (iv) gamete donors who execute a compliant donation relinquish any parental rights and obligations; (v) any clause in a surrogacy agreement that purports to control a pregnant person’s prenatal medical decisions or bodily autonomy is unenforceable. Alex and Jordan, who are unable to use their own gametes, receive a cryopreserved embryo created from anonymous donor gametes through a licensed program after the donors executed a valid donation. They enter into a written agreement with Mia, who will carry the pregnancy. The agreement provides for reimbursement of documented pregnancy-related expenses only and contains no fee for carrying the pregnancy. Alex and Jordan hope to obtain a court order recognizing them as legal parents as soon as possible after the child’s birth. The embryo is transferred to Mia, who becomes pregnant. Based solely on the definitions and rules above, and applying standard surrogacy taxonomy, which option best classifies the arrangement and predicts the most likely enforceability and parentage pathway?\n\nA. This is gestational altruistic surrogacy; reimbursements are lawful; the agreement is enforceable in part, including expense reimbursements and administrative obligations, but clauses controlling medical decisions are unenforceable; because there is no genetic link to either intended parent, a direct parentage order is not available, so adoption is the likely pathway if the surrogate consents and the best-interests standard is satisfied.\n\nB. This is traditional commercial surrogacy; the entire agreement is void because any payment, including expense reimbursement, is treated as baby-selling; the surrogate remains the legal mother indefinitely and the intended parents have no viable path to parentage due to embryo donation.\n\nC. This is gestational altruistic surrogacy; the agreement is fully enforceable, including any prenatal conduct provisions; a pre-birth parentage order is available even without a genetic link because donor relinquishment eliminates the need for a genetic tie.\n\nD. This is gestational altruistic surrogacy; reimbursements are lawful; despite the lack of a genetic link, the court is likely to issue a post-birth parentage order to the intended parents based on donor relinquishment and the best-interests standard, making adoption unnecessary.", "solution": "The problem statement constitutes a set of legal axioms and a factual scenario, requiring a logical deduction based on these premises. It is scientifically grounded in the context of assisted reproductive technology, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. Therefore, the problem is valid and can be solved through direct application of the provided rules.\n\nThe analysis of the arrangement between Alex, Jordan, and Mia under the Northshire Surrogacy Act involves three components: classification of the surrogacy, enforceability of the agreement, and the legal pathway to parentage for the intended parents.\n\n1.  **Classification of the Surrogacy Arrangement**\n    The type of surrogacy is determined by two factors: the genetic origin of the embryo and the nature of the compensation.\n    *   **Gestational vs. Traditional Surrogacy**: Traditional surrogacy involves the fertilization of the surrogate’s own ovum, making her a genetic parent. Gestational surrogacy involves the transfer of an embryo to which the surrogate has no genetic relationship. The problem states the embryo was \"created from anonymous donor gametes\" and transferred to Mia. Therefore, Mia, the surrogate, is not genetically related to the child. This is correctly classified as **gestational surrogacy**.\n    *   **Altruistic vs. Commercial Surrogacy**: Rule (i) of the Act voids \"commercial surrogacy agreements that include compensation beyond documented pregnancy-related expenses\". Rule (ii) permits \"altruistic arrangements that limit payments to documented pregnancy-related expense reimbursements\". The agreement with Mia \"provides for reimbursement of documented pregnancy-related expenses only and contains no fee for carrying the pregnancy.\" This arrangement falls squarely under the definition of a permitted altruistic surrogacy in rule (ii).\n    *   Combining these, the arrangement is **gestational altruistic surrogacy**.\n\n2.  **Enforceability of the Agreement**\n    The Act provides specific rules regarding the legality and enforceability of surrogacy agreements.\n    *   Rule (ii) explicitly states that altruistic arrangements are \"permitted\". Therefore, the core provision of the agreement—the reimbursement of documented expenses for Mia—is lawful.\n    *   Rule (v) specifies that \"any clause in a surrogacy agreement that purports to control a pregnant person’s prenatal medical decisions or bodily autonomy is unenforceable.\" This means that even if such clauses exist in the agreement, they cannot be legally enforced. This rule implies a principle of severability, where the unenforceability of one part of the contract does not automatically void the entire agreement. Thus, the agreement would be considered **enforceable in part**: the lawful provisions, such as expense reimbursement and administrative cooperation, would likely remain valid, while any unlawful provisions would be struck down.\n\n3.  **Pathway to Parentage**\n    The central question for Alex and Jordan is how to establish legal parentage. Rule (iii) of the Act is definitive on this matter.\n    *   Rule (iii) outlines the requirements for a court to issue a \"parentage order\": it must be post-birth, have the surrogate’s consent, satisfy a best-interests-of-the-child analysis, and—critically—there must be \"a genetic link between at least one intended parent and the child.\"\n    *   The facts state the embryo was created from \"anonymous donor gametes\" and that Alex and Jordan \"are unable to use their own gametes.\" This establishes that there is **no genetic link** to either intended parent.\n    *   Rule (iii) contains a clear and unambiguous contingency for this exact situation: \"if there is no genetic link, intended parents must proceed by **adoption**.\" This explicitly bars Alex and Jordan from obtaining a direct parentage order.\n    *   Rule (iv), which states that gamete donors relinquish parental rights, is relevant for clearing potential claims from the anonymous donors, but it does not override the specific requirement for parentage orders in rule (iii). The donors' relinquishment makes the child legally available for adoption but does not in itself create a parental relationship for Alex and Jordan. The path for creating that relationship is dictated by rule (iii).\n    *   Therefore, the only available pathway to legal parentage for Alex and Jordan under the Northshire Surrogacy Act is adoption, which would be contingent on Mia's consent post-birth and a best-interests-of-the-child finding by the court.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, we can evaluate the provided options.\n\n**A. This is gestational altruistic surrogacy; reimbursements are lawful; the agreement is enforceable in part, including expense reimbursements and administrative obligations, but clauses controlling medical decisions are unenforceable; because there is no genetic link to either intended parent, a direct parentage order is not available, so adoption is the likely pathway if the surrogate consents and the best-interests standard is satisfied.**\n*   **Analysis**: This option correctly identifies the arrangement as \"gestational altruistic surrogacy\". It accurately describes the partial enforceability of the agreement, noting that reimbursements are lawful per rule (ii) while clauses controlling medical decisions are unenforceable per rule (v). Most importantly, it correctly applies rule (iii) by stating that the lack of a genetic link prevents a direct parentage order and necessitates adoption as the legal pathway, contingent upon the surrogate's consent and a best-interests analysis. This statement is fully consistent with the derivation from the problem's rules.\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. This is traditional commercial surrogacy; the entire agreement is void because any payment, including expense reimbursement, is treated as baby-selling; the surrogate remains the legal mother indefinitely and the intended parents have no viable path to parentage due to embryo donation.**\n*   **Analysis**: This option is incorrect on multiple grounds. It misclassifies the arrangement as \"traditional\" (it is gestational) and \"commercial\" (it is altruistic). It incorrectly claims the agreement is void, contradicting rule (ii). It wrongly asserts there is \"no viable path to parentage,\" contradicting rule (iii) which specifies adoption as the path.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. This is gestational altruistic surrogacy; the agreement is fully enforceable, including any prenatal conduct provisions; a pre-birth parentage order is available even without a genetic link because donor relinquishment eliminates the need for a genetic tie.**\n*   **Analysis**: While the classification is correct, the remainder is flawed. It incorrectly claims the agreement is \"fully enforceable,\" which contradicts rule (v). It suggests a \"pre-birth\" order is available, which contradicts rule (iii) requiring a post-birth process. It incorrectly argues that donor relinquishment (rule (iv)) overrides the explicit genetic link requirement for a parentage order (rule (iii)).\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. This is gestational altruistic surrogacy; reimbursements are lawful; despite the lack of a genetic link, the court is likely to issue a post-birth parentage order to the intended parents based on donor relinquishment and the best-interests standard, making adoption unnecessary.**\n*   **Analysis**: This option correctly classifies the surrogacy and the lawfulness of reimbursements. However, its core claim about the parentage pathway is a direct contradiction of the provided law. It suggests a court would issue a parentage order \"despite the lack of a genetic link,\" when rule (iii) explicitly states that in such a case, the parents \"must proceed by adoption.\" The problem requires an answer based solely on the given rules, and this option proposes that a court would ignore an explicit directive.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4474330"}, {"introduction": "The legal duty to provide informed consent is not merely a formality; it requires a clear communication of relevant risks, which are often statistical in nature.

The problem is determined to be valid as it is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and mathematically well-posed.\n\nFirst, we establish a formal probabilistic framework based on the provided information.\nLet $A$ be the event that an embryo is affected by the pathogenic variant.\nLet $U$ be the event that an embryo is unaffected. The event $U$ is the complement of event $A$.\nLet $+$ be the event that the PGD test result is positive.\nLet $-$ be the event that the PGD test result is negative.\n\nThe problem statement provides the following probabilities:\nThe probability that an embryo is affected is given as $\\pi$. This represents the prevalence of the condition in the population of embryos.\n$$P(A) = \\pi = 0.5$$\nSince the events $A$ and $U$ are complementary, the probability that an embryo is unaffected is:\n$$P(U) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - \\pi = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$$\n\nThe diagnostic accuracy of the PGD assay is defined by its sensitivity ($Se$) and specificity ($Sp$).\nSensitivity is the conditional probability of a positive test result given that the embryo is affected:\n$$Se = P(+ | A) = 0.96$$\nSpecificity is the conditional probability of a negative test result given that the embryo is unaffected:\n$$Sp = P(- | U) = 0.98$$\n\nThe task is to derive an expression for the \"overall false positive rate $FP$\". The problem provides an explicit definition for this term: \"$FP$ is defined as the probability that an embryo is truly unaffected but yields a positive PGD result.\" This translates to the joint probability of the event $U$ and the event $+$. We must, therefore, calculate:\n$$FP = P(U \\cap +)$$\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, the joint probability of two events can be expressed as $P(E_1 \\cap E_2) = P(E_1 | E_2)P(E_2)$.

The term $P(+ | U)$ is the probability of a positive test result, given the embryo is unaffected.
