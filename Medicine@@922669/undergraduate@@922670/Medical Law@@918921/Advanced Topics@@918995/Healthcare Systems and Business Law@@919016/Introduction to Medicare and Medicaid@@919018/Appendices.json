Under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS), payment for each service is built on the Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS), which assigns three component Relative Value Units (RVUs): physician work, practice expense, and professional liability (malpractice). Federal statute and regulation require that each component RVU be geographically adjusted by its corresponding Geographic Practice Cost Index (GPCI) for the locality, and that the sum of those geographically adjusted RVUs be translated into dollars by multiplying by the annual national conversion factor. \n\nFor a particular Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code furnished in a non-facility setting in a specified locality, suppose the following values apply:\n- Physician work RVU: $1.90$, practice expense RVU: $1.35$, malpractice RVU: $0.09$.\n- Work GPCI: $1.025$, practice expense GPCI: $0.975$, malpractice GPCI: $0.980$.\n- Annual conversion factor: $32.74$.\n\nStarting only from the above legal-structural facts about how the MPFS constructs payment and the given inputs, derive the appropriate expression for the Medicare-allowed amount for this service in this locality and compute its value.

The procedure for this calculation is explicitly stated and can be formalized into a mathematical expression.\n\nFirst, let us define symbolic variables for the given quantities.\nLet $RVU_w$, $RVU_p$, and $RVU_m$ represent the Relative Value Units for physician work, practice expense, and professional liability (malpractice), respectively.\nLet $GPCI_w$, $GPCI_p$, and $GPCI_m$ represent the corresponding Geographic Practice Cost Indices for the locality.\nLet $CF$ be the annual national conversion factor.\nLet $P$ be the Medicare-allowed payment amount in United States dollars (USD).\n\nAccording to the problem description, the calculation proceeds in two steps:\n1.  Each component RVU is geographically adjusted by multiplying it with its corresponding GPCI. The sum of these three products yields the total geographically adjusted RVU for the service in the specific locality. Let us denote this total as $RVU_{total}$. The formula is:\n$$RVU_{total} = (RVU_w \\cdot GPCI_w) + (RVU_p \\cdot GPCI_p) + (RVU_m \\cdot GPCI_m)$$\n\n2.  The total geographically adjusted RVU is then converted into a dollar amount by multiplying it by the national conversion factor. The formula for the payment amount $P$ is:\n$$P = RVU_{total} \\cdot CF$$\n\nCombining these two steps, we derive the complete expression for the payment amount:\n$$P = [(RVU_w \\cdot GPCI_w) + (RVU_p \\cdot GPCI_p) + (RVU_m \\cdot GPCI_m)] \\cdot CF$$\n\nThe problem provides the following numerical values for these variables:\n- Physician work RVU, $RVU_w = 1.90$\n- Practice expense RVU, $RVU_p = 1.35$\n- Malpractice RVU, $RVU_m = 0.09$\n- Work GPCI, $GPCI_w = 1.025$\n- Practice expense GPCI, $GPCI_p = 0.975$\n- Malpractice GPCI, $GPCI_m = 0.980$\n- Annual conversion factor, $CF = 32.74$\n\nWe substitute these values into the formula. First, we calculate the individual geographically adjusted RVU components:\n- Adjusted work RVU: $RVU_w \\cdot GPCI_w = 1.90 \\times 1.025 = 1.9475$\n- Adjusted practice expense RVU: $RVU_p \\cdot GPCI_p = 1.35 \\times 0.975 = 1.31625$\n- Adjusted malpractice RVU: $RVU_m \\cdot GPCI_m = 0.09 \\times 0.980 = 0.0882$\n\nNext, we sum these components to find the total geographically adjusted RVU, $RVU_{total}$:\n$$RVU_{total} = 1.9475 + 1.31625 + 0.0882 = 3.35195$$\n\nFinally, we multiply this total by the conversion factor to determine the payment amount $P$:\n$$P = 3.35195 \\times 32.74 = 109.749803$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $P = 109.749803$. The first four significant figures are $1$, $0$, $9$, and $7$. The fifth significant figure is $4$. Since $4$ is less than $5$, we do not round up the fourth significant figure. Therefore, the value rounded to four significant figures is $109.7$.

The solution is derived by systematically applying the provided income-counting rules and spend-down procedures over the specified budget period.\n\nFirst, we define the given parameters symbolically:\n- Monthly earned income: $I_E = 2000$\n- Monthly unearned income: $I_U = 400$\n- General monthly income disregard: $D_G = 20$\n- Specific monthly earned income disregard: $D_E = 65$\n- Countable fraction of remaining earned income: $F_E = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- Medically Needy Income Level for a household of $3$: $MNIL = 850$\n- Budget period: $T = 6$ months\n- Monthly health insurance premium expense: $E_{prem} = 120$\n- Monthly prescribed medication expense: $E_{med} = 60$\n- One-time hospital bill: $E_{hosp} = 400$\n\nThe calculation proceeds in several steps as mandated by the problem.\n\n**1. Calculation of Countable Monthly Income**\n\nThe Supplemental Security Income (SSI) methodology involves a specific sequence of disregards applied to unearned and earned income.\n\nFirst, we calculate the countable unearned income, $I_{UC}$. The general income disregard of $\\$20$ is applied first to unearned income.\n$$I_{UC} = I_U - D_G = \\$400 - \\$20 = \\$380$$\nSince the unearned income $I_U = 400$ is greater than the disregard $D_G = 20$, the full disregard is utilized, and no portion remains to be applied to earned income.\n\nNext, we calculate the countable earned income, $I_{EC}$. The rules specify two disregards for earned income: a flat $\\$65$ and then one-half of the remainder.\nFirst, the $\\$65$ disregard is subtracted from the gross earned income:\n$$\\$2000 - D_E = \\$2000 - \\$65 = \\$1935$$\nAs noted, there is no leftover general disregard to apply. Next, one-half of this remaining amount is counted as income:\n$$I_{EC} = F_E \\times (\\$2000 - D_E) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\$1935 = \\$967.50$$\n\nThe total countable monthly income, $I_C$, is the sum of the countable unearned and earned incomes.\n$$I_C = I_{UC} + I_{EC} = \\$380 + \\$967.50 = \\$1347.50$$\n\n**2. Calculation of Monthly Excess Income and Total Spend-Down Requirement**\n\nThe monthly excess income, $I_{excess}$, is the amount by which the countable monthly income exceeds the state's MNIL.\n$$I_{excess} = I_C - MNIL = \\$1347.50 - \\$850 = \\$497.50$$\nThis excess income represents the monthly spend-down liability.\n\nThe total spend-down requirement, $S_{total}$, is the cumulative excess income over the entire $6$-month budget period.\n$$S_{total} = I_{excess} \\times T = \\$497.50 \\times 6 = \\$2985$$\nThis is the total amount of medical expenses the household must incur to become eligible for Medicaid for the duration of the budget period.\n\n**3. Application of Incurred Medical Expenses**\n\nWe must now sum the total allowable medical expenses incurred by the household during the $6$-month budget period to see how much of the spend-down requirement has been met.\n\nThe total recurring monthly expenses are the sum of the insurance premium and medication costs:\n$$E_{monthly} = E_{prem} + E_{med} = \\$120 + \\$60 = \\$180$$\nOver the $6$-month budget period, these recurring expenses total:\n$$E_{recurring\\_total} = E_{monthly} \\times T = \\$180 \\times 6 = \\$1080$$\n\nThe total incurred medical expenses, $E_{total}$, is the sum of the total recurring expenses and the one-time hospital bill.\n$$E_{total} = E_{recurring\\_total} + E_{hosp} = \\$1080 + \\$400 = \\$1480$$\n\n**4. Calculation of the Remaining Spend-Down Amount**\n\nFinally, the remaining spend-down amount, $S_{rem}$, is the total spend-down requirement minus the total incurred medical expenses that have been applied.\n$$S_{rem} = S_{total} - E_{total} = \\$2985 - \\$1480 = \\$1505$$\n\nThus, after applying all listed medical expenses for the $6$-month period, the household still has a remaining spend-down requirement of $\\$1505$ to meet before establishing Medicaid eligibility.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1505}$$", "id": "4491101"}, {"introduction": "The integrity of the Medicare and Medicaid programs relies on robust legal enforcement against fraud, waste, and abuse.
