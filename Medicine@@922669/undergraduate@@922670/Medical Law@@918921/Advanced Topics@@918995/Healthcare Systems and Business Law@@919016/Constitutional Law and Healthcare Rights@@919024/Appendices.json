This practice [@problem_id:4477491] challenges you to dissect the complex relationship between a private hospital and a county government to master the crucial legal tests that determine when private conduct becomes fairly attributable to the state.", "problem": "A private, nonprofit hospital, Riverbend Medical Center, operates the only full-service emergency department in Polk County. By county ordinance, Riverbend is designated as the county’s emergency receiving center for trauma and advanced life support cases. County Emergency Medical Services (EMS) protocols require ambulances to route qualifying patients to Riverbend. Riverbend accepts these ambulance deliveries and is subject to extensive county reporting and quality benchmarks tied to a modest annual subsidy for trauma readiness. A patient alleges that Riverbend’s refusal to provide stabilizing treatment violated the patient’s rights under the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The patient can prevail on a constitutional claim only if Riverbend’s challenged conduct constitutes “state action.”\n\nUsing the foundational constitutional law requirement that the Fourteenth Amendment binds governmental actors and private conduct is subject to constitutional constraints only when it is fairly attributable to the state, analyze which of the following additional facts, if true, would most likely establish that Riverbend’s refusal to treat constitutes state action for constitutional purposes. Apply first principles of the state action doctrine, including the public function test, state compulsion/coercion, joint action, and nexus/entwinement, rather than relying on mere funding or regulation.\n\nSelect all that apply.\n\nA.

Providing emergency medical care is a traditional and exclusive public function historically performed by the government; by operating the county’s designated emergency receiving center, Riverbend necessarily acts as the government.\n\nE. Under state law, Riverbend is expressly authorized to detain individuals for an emergency psychiatric evaluation without a court order, and the challenged conduct is Riverbend’s involuntary detention of the patient pursuant to that delegated authority.", "solution": "### Principle-Based Derivation\n\nThe 14th Amendment's limitations apply to governmental or \"state\" action, not the conduct of private individuals or entities. For a private entity's conduct to be subject to constitutional constraints, it must be \"fairly attributable to the state.\" The problem requires an analysis based on four established tests for determining this attribution:\n\n1.  **Public Function Test:** State action is found if a private entity exercises powers \"traditionally and exclusively reserved to the State.\" This is a very narrow and stringent test.\n2.  **State Compulsion/Coercion Test:** State action exists if the state has exercised coercive power or has provided such significant encouragement, either overt or covert, that the choice must in law be deemed to be that of the State.\n3.  **Joint Action/Participation Test:** State action is present when the state has \"so far insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with [the private entity] that it must be recognized as a joint participant in the challenged activity.\"\n4.  **Nexus/Entwinement Test:** This test looks for a \"sufficiently close nexus\" between the state and the challenged action of the private entity, such that the action may be fairly treated as that of the state itself. This can involve the state's delegation of its authority or deep entwinement in the entity's management or activities.\n\nThe baseline facts (exclusive designation, EMS protocol, subsidy, reporting) establish a relationship between the county and Riverbend, but under Supreme Court precedent, this extensive regulation and funding alone is typically insufficient to convert a private hospital's medical decisions into state action. We will now evaluate each option as an additional fact.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Riverbend receives county funds for trauma readiness and is subject to detailed county regulations governing triage and reporting, but Riverbend’s clinicians alone decide whether any particular patient will be stabilized or transferred.**\n\nThis option strengthens the argument *against* a finding of state action. The core of the patient's claim is the \"refusal to provide stabilizing treatment.\" This option explicitly states that this specific decision is made by \"Riverbend’s clinicians alone.\" The state's involvement is limited to funding and regulation, which the prompt instructs us to disregard as a sole basis for state action. By stipulating that the state has no influence over the challenged clinical decision, this fact fails the compulsion, joint action, and nexus tests with respect to the specific conduct at issue.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. The county ordinance designating Riverbend as the emergency receiving center directs all county ambulances to deliver trauma patients there, but the county does not participate in or review specific treatment decisions.**\n\nThis fact is similar to option A. It clarifies that while the state compels patients to be brought to Riverbend's door, its involvement ceases at that point. The challenged action is the \"refusal to treat,\" not the transport. Because the county \"does not participate in or review specific treatment decisions,\" there is no state compulsion or joint participation in the act giving rise to the alleged constitutional violation. The nexus between the state and the *challenged action* is severed.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The county contracts with Riverbend to operate intake at the emergency department; a sheriff’s deputy, stationed at Riverbend and deputized to screen admissions under county policy, makes binding admission decisions, and Riverbend’s refusal to treat the patient followed the deputy’s direction.**\n\nThis set of facts provides a powerful argument for state action. A sheriff's deputy is a state actor. The deputy is not merely present but is making \"binding admission decisions\" pursuant to \"county policy.\" Most critically, Riverbend's challenged action—the refusal to treat—\"followed the deputy’s direction.\" This is a textbook example of the **State Compulsion/Coercion Test**. The state, through its agent, has directly commanded the private entity to take the specific action being challenged. The decision is no longer that of the private hospital but is \"fairly attributable to the state.\" This scenario also satisfies the **Joint Action Test**, as the state and the hospital are acting as joint participants in the admissions process that resulted in the refusal to treat.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Providing emergency medical care is a traditional and exclusive public function historically performed by the government; by operating the county’s designated emergency receiving center, Riverbend necessarily acts as the government.**\n\nThis option invokes the **Public Function Test**. However, its premise is a false statement of US constitutional law. The Supreme Court has interpreted the \"traditional and exclusive\" requirement extremely narrowly. It has found functions like running an entire town or conducting primary elections to meet the test, but has explicitly held that functions such as providing education, utility services, and even nursing home care are not exclusive state functions. Healthcare, including emergency medical services, has a long history of private provision in the United States. Therefore, the assertion that providing emergency care is a \"traditional and exclusive public function\" is legally incorrect. The conclusion that Riverbend \"necessarily acts as the government\" is based on this flawed premise.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Under state law, Riverbend is expressly authorized to detain individuals for an emergency psychiatric evaluation without a court order, and the challenged conduct is Riverbend’s involuntary detention of the patient pursuant to that delegated authority.**\n\nThis option presents a strong case for state action, albeit by slightly reformulating the challenged conduct for the purpose of the hypothetical. The power to deprive an individual of liberty through involuntary detention is a quintessential sovereign power of the state. When a state passes a law that \"expressly authorize[s]\" a private entity to exercise this power, it is delegating its sovereign authority. A private actor exercising such delegated state power is considered a state actor for purposes of that action. This falls squarely under the principle of the **Nexus/Entwinement Test**, particularly as articulated in cases involving the delegation of state authority. Even though the problem's preamble focuses on \"refusal to treat,\" this option states that the challenged conduct *is* the detention. A private hospital exercising a state-delegated power to involuntarily commit a person is engaging in state action. Furthermore, if the refusal to treat occurred during or as a consequence of this unlawful detention, the entire course of conduct would be viewed as being under color of state law, making the refusal to treat state action as well. Thus, this fact establishes a direct link between the state and a deprivation of a constitutional right (liberty).\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{CE}$$", "id": "4477491"}, {"introduction": "When a government agency acts to deprive an individual of a significant interest like a professional license, the Constitution demands \"procedural due process.\" This is not a rigid checklist but a flexible balancing of the private interests at stake, the government's justification for its actions, and the risk of making a mistake. This exercise [@problem_id:4477670] requires you to apply this nuanced balancing framework to an urgent public health scenario, honing your ability to analyze what process is constitutionally \"due\" when immediate action is taken.", "problem": "A state medical board received an investigative audit indicating that a licensed physician, Dr. L, submitted reimbursement claims for services that a sampling suggested were not actually performed and wrote a cluster of unusually high-dose opioid prescriptions. The audit flagged approximately 200 prescriptions over the prior 30 days, and state investigators reported that 2 nonfatal overdoses were linked to patients of Dr. L’s clinic during that period. Without providing prior notice or an opportunity to be heard, the board issued an order “terminating” Dr. L’s medical license effective immediately. The order recited statutory authority permitting immediate action where the board finds an “immediate danger to public health, safety, or welfare,” listed the audit findings and overdose reports, and scheduled a post-deprivation evidentiary hearing for 45 days later. Dr. L sued in state court, alleging a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and seeking reinstatement or, at minimum, a prompt hearing. The state argues that the combination of alleged fraud and risk of opioid harm justified its action and that a later hearing suffices.\n\nAssuming the audit is facially credible but not yet tested in an adversarial setting, which option best states the constitutionally sound analysis of whether the lack of a predeprivation hearing violates procedural due process?\n\nA. The action likely complies with procedural due process because protecting patients and preventing healthcare fraud always outweighs a physician’s interest in continued practice, and any hearing scheduled within 60 days is per se “prompt,” regardless of the deprivation’s severity.\n\nB. The action likely violates procedural due process because permanent termination of a professional license without a prior hearing is generally impermissible; where immediate action is justified by a concrete, articulable danger, the Constitution tolerates only temporary, interim measures coupled with a genuinely prompt post-deprivation hearing measured in days, not weeks.\n\nC. There is no procedural due process problem because professional licenses are privileges, not property, and therefore are not protected interests requiring notice and an opportunity to be heard.\n\nD. There is no procedural due process violation because a post-deprivation state-law damages remedy suffices whenever the deprivation results from a decision by a government employee, even if the decision reflects established state procedures.\n\nE. The action is constitutional if and only if the state can prove the alleged fraud by clear and convincing evidence before the delayed hearing; the timing of the hearing is irrelevant so long as the ultimate evidentiary standard is high.", "solution": "The central issue is whether the state medical board's procedures satisfied the requirements of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This analysis requires applying the framework established by the U.S. Supreme Court for procedural due process claims.\n\n**1. Governing Principles:**\nThe Fourteenth Amendment prohibits any state from depriving a person of \"life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" The analysis proceeds in two steps: first, determining whether a protected liberty or property interest is at stake, and second, determining what process is \"due.\"\n\n*   **Property Interest:** It is long-settled constitutional law that a professional license, once issued, constitutes a protected property interest. The state cannot revoke or suspend it without affording procedural due process. The old \"right-privilege distinction,\" which might have categorized such licenses as mere privileges, has been defunct in this area of law for decades.\n\n*   **The *Mathews v. Eldridge* Balancing Test:** To determine what process is due, courts balance three factors:\n    1.  The private interest that will be affected by the official action.\n    2.  The risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards.\n    3.  The Government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\n\n*   **Pre-Deprivation Hearing Requirement and its Exception:** Ordinarily, the Constitution requires notice and an opportunity to be heard *before* the government deprives an individual of a property interest. However, the Supreme Court has recognized an exception for exigent circumstances. Where there is a demonstrated immediate threat to public health or safety, the government may take immediate action (e.g., suspension of a license) and provide a hearing afterward. See, e.g., *Gilbert v. Homar*, *FDIC v. Mallen*.\n\n*   **Requirements in Exigent Circumstances:** When a pre-deprivation hearing is bypassed, due process still imposes strict limits. The post-deprivation hearing must be \"prompt.\" Furthermore, the nature of the immediate action is critical. The courts are far more likely to uphold a temporary *suspension* pending a hearing than an outright, permanent *termination* or revocation.\n\n**2. Application to the Facts:**\n\n*   **Private Interest:** Dr. L's interest in their medical license is profoundly important. It is the basis for their livelihood, professional standing, and reputation. Its \"termination\" is a deprivation of the highest severity.\n*   **Government's Interest:** The government's interest is also extremely high. The allegations involve not only potential fraud but, more critically, a direct threat to public health via the over-prescription of opioids, linked to 2 recent overdoses. Preventing further harm is a compelling state interest that can justify immediate action.\n*   **Risk of Error and Value of Process:** The risk of an erroneous deprivation is significant. The audit is \"facially credible but not yet tested.\" Dr. L has had no opportunity to challenge the findings, explain the pattern of prescriptions (e.g., they may relate to a specialized palliative care practice), or clarify the billing issues. A pre-deprivation hearing, or at least a very prompt post-deprivation hearing, would have immense value in correcting a potential error before irreparable harm is done to Dr. L's career.\n\n**3. Synthesis:**\nBalancing these factors, the state's compelling interest in public safety likely justifies dispensing with a *pre-deprivation* hearing. The evidence of high-dose opioid prescriptions and linked overdoses presents a classic \"immediate danger\" scenario. However, the state's chosen procedure has two constitutionally problematic features:\n\n*   **Nature of the Deprivation:** The board \"terminated\" the license. This implies a permanent revocation. Due process in emergency situations typically condones only a temporary *suspension* to remove the immediate threat, with the final decision of termination reserved for after a full evidentiary hearing. An immediate, final termination based on untested evidence is constitutionally suspect.\n*   **Timing of the Post-Deprivation Hearing:** The hearing is scheduled for 45 days later. For a deprivation as severe as the complete loss of one's profession, a delay of six-and-a-half weeks is unlikely to be considered \"prompt.\" The promptness of the hearing is a crucial element that ensures the emergency suspension is not a de facto final termination without due process. Courts have scrutinized delays of this length and often found them wanting. The hearing should be held as soon as practicable, typically measured in days or a small number of weeks.\n\nTherefore, the state's action likely violates procedural due process because it used an excessive measure (termination instead of suspension) and scheduled the post-deprivation hearing after an unreasonable delay.\n\n## EVALUATION OF OPTIONS\n\n**A. The action likely complies with procedural due process because protecting patients and preventing healthcare fraud always outweighs a physician’s interest in continued practice, and any hearing scheduled within 60 days is per se “prompt,” regardless of the deprivation’s severity.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. The *Mathews* test is a *balancing* test, not a categorical rule where the government's interest \"always outweighs\" the private one. Furthermore, there is no *per se* rule that a 60 day (or 45 day) delay is prompt; promptness is context-sensitive and evaluated based on the specific circumstances, including the severity of the deprivation.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. The action likely violates procedural due process because permanent termination of a professional license without a prior hearing is generally impermissible; where immediate action is justified by a concrete, articulable danger, the Constitution tolerates only temporary, interim measures coupled with a genuinely prompt post-deprivation hearing measured in days, not weeks.**\nThis option provides an accurate and nuanced analysis. It correctly states the general rule requiring a pre-deprivation hearing, acknowledges the specific exception for immediate danger, and—most critically—identifies the two key flaws in the state's action: the use of \"termination\" (a permanent measure) instead of a temporary suspension, and the lengthy delay for the post-deprivation hearing (45 days, which is measured in weeks, not days). This aligns perfectly with the controlling legal principles.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. There is no procedural due process problem because professional licenses are privileges, not property, and therefore are not protected interests requiring notice and an opportunity to be heard.**\nThis is a misstatement of modern constitutional law. The Supreme Court has long held that professional licenses are a form of property protected by the Due Process Clause. This option relies on the obsolete right-privilege distinction.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. There is no procedural due process violation because a post-deprivation state-law damages remedy suffices whenever the deprivation results from a decision by a government employee, even if the decision reflects established state procedures.**\nThis misapplies the *Parratt-Hudson* doctrine. That doctrine applies to \"random and unauthorized\" acts of state employees for which a pre-deprivation hearing is impracticable. Here, the board's action was taken pursuant to an \"established state procedure\" (a statute authorizing immediate action). In such cases, the state is required to provide constitutionally adequate procedures (like a prompt post-deprivation hearing), and a subsequent tort remedy is not a sufficient substitute.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The action is constitutional if and only if the state can prove the alleged fraud by clear and convincing evidence before the delayed hearing; the timing of the hearing is irrelevant so long as the ultimate evidentiary standard is high.**\nThis option incorrectly asserts that the timing of the hearing is \"irrelevant.\" The timing of the opportunity to be heard is a core component of procedural due process. A high standard of proof at a late hearing cannot cure the constitutional defect of an unreasonably delayed process, especially while a severe deprivation is ongoing.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4477670"}, {"introduction": "While constitutional claims are powerful, some of the most important healthcare rights are established by federal statutes. Laws like the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) create specific, enforceable duties for healthcare providers. This final practice [@problem_id:4477577] presents a complex scenario where you must analyze the interplay between these federal statutes, a provider's constitutional claims of religious freedom, and conflicting state laws, demonstrating how a patient's right to care is often determined at the intersection of multiple legal frameworks.", "problem": "A privately owned, non-profit hospital that participates in Medicare operates a busy emergency department. A patient arrives with acute internal bleeding following a recent gender-affirming procedure performed elsewhere.

The hospital points to a state conscience statute that permits providers to decline participation in procedures that conflict with their sincerely held beliefs. The patient sues, alleging violations of the United States Constitution, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), and Section $1557$ of the Affordable Care Act, and seeks federal administrative enforcement by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nWhich option best reflects the correct constitutional and healthcare rights analysis of the hospital’s refusal?\n\nA. Because constitutional guarantees typically bind government actors, the Equal Protection Clause claim against the private hospital fails absent state action. EMTALA independently obligates Medicare-participating hospitals with emergency departments to provide an appropriate medical screening examination and stabilizing care for emergency medical conditions, without regard to gender identity. Section $1557$ likely prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex as interpreted to include gender identity by federal regulators and courts. The Free Exercise Clause does not excuse noncompliance with neutral, generally applicable federal obligations, and any religious defense under federal statute would not displace EMTALA’s compelling interest in preventing denial of emergency stabilizing care. The state conscience law cannot override federal duties due to the Supremacy Clause.\n\nB. Emergency care is a traditional public function, making the hospital a state actor; therefore, the Equal Protection Clause applies and the refusal violates it. However, EMTALA does not apply when treatment conflicts with sincerely held religious beliefs, so the hospital is exempt.\n\nC.

Moreover, the First Amendment categorically bars enforcement of federal health obligations that burden religious exercise, so HHS cannot act.\n\nD. EMTALA obligations to screen and stabilize attach only after inpatient admission, so the hospital was permitted to refuse examination and stabilization in the emergency department. Constitutional equal protection duties attach to any entity that receives federal funds, so the patient’s constitutional claim is likely to succeed against the hospital.\n\nE. Even if federal law requires stabilization, the state conscience statute preempts EMTALA for cases involving moral objections, allowing the hospital to refuse treatment without federal consequence.", "solution": "A correct analysis requires an examination of each legal claim and defense presented in the fact pattern.\n\n1.  **Constitutional Claim (Equal Protection Clause):** The Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause prohibits government entities from denying equal protection of the laws. A critical prerequisite for such a claim is \"state action.\" The hospital is described as \"privately owned.\" While there are doctrines to find state action in private conduct (e.g., the public function test, the entanglement test), the U.S. Supreme Court has held that neither the receipt of government funds (including Medicare) nor heavy state regulation is generally sufficient on its own to convert a private entity into a state actor for constitutional purposes. Therefore, a direct constitutional claim against the private hospital is likely to fail for lack of state action.\n\n2.  **Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA):** This federal statute applies to any hospital that participates in the Medicare program and has an emergency department. The hospital meets these criteria. EMTALA imposes two core obligations:\n    *   When an individual \"comes to the emergency department,\" the hospital must provide an \"appropriate medical screening examination\" (MSE) to determine if an \"emergency medical condition\" (EMC) exists.\n    *   If an EMC is identified, the hospital must provide treatment to \"stabilize\" the condition, or provide for an appropriate transfer.\n    These obligations apply to **all** individuals, regardless of their diagnosis, personal history, insurance status, or ability to pay. The statute contains no exception for religious or moral objections. The hospital's refusal to provide an MSE and stabilizing treatment for a confirmed EMC is a direct violation of its duties under EMTALA.\n\n3.  **Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA):** Section $1557$ prohibits discrimination on several grounds, including \"sex,\" in any health program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. The hospital receives Medicare funds, so it is covered. Following the Supreme Court's ruling in *Bostock v. Clayton County*, which held that discrimination on the basis of gender identity is a form of sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, federal agencies (like HHS) and courts have extended this interpretation to other federal statutes prohibiting sex discrimination, including Section $1557$. Refusing to treat a patient's emergency medical condition (acute internal bleeding) because it arose from gender-affirming care, when it would treat the same condition for another patient, constitutes discrimination based on gender identity. This is therefore a likely violation of Section $1557$.\n\n4.  **Religious/Conscience Defenses:** The hospital raises religious and moral objections.\n    *   **First Amendment Free Exercise Clause:** In *Employment Division v. Smith*, the Supreme Court established that the Free Exercise Clause does not provide an exemption from neutral laws of general applicability. EMTALA is a neutral law that applies generally to all Medicare-participating hospitals with emergency departments, aimed at the secular purpose of preventing patient harm.\n    *   **Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA):** While not explicitly mentioned, RFRA could be invoked. It requires the government to show that a law substantially burdening religious exercise is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest. Preventing the imminent death or serious bodily harm of a patient in an emergency department is indisputably a compelling interest. Mandating immediate screening and stabilization is the only, and therefore least restrictive, means of achieving that interest. A RFRA defense would almost certainly fail in the face of EMTALA's life-saving mandate.\n\n5.  **State Conscience Statute and the Supremacy Clause:** The U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause (Article VI, Clause $2$) dictates that valid federal laws are the supreme law of the land and preempt, or override, conflicting state laws. The hospital's obligations under federal statutes (EMTALA and Section $1557$) cannot be nullified by a state's conscience protection law. The state law is preempted in this context and offers no legal defense to the violation of federal duties.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A: Because constitutional guarantees typically bind government actors, the Equal Protection Clause claim against the private hospital fails absent state action. EMTALA independently obligates Medicare-participating hospitals with emergency departments to provide an appropriate medical screening examination and stabilizing care for emergency medical conditions, without regard to gender identity. Section $1557$ likely prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex as interpreted to include gender identity by federal regulators and courts. The Free Exercise Clause does not excuse noncompliance with neutral, generally applicable federal obligations, and any religious defense under federal statute would not displace EMTALA’s compelling interest in preventing denial of emergency stabilizing care. The state conscience law cannot override federal duties due to the Supremacy Clause.**\n    This option correctly analyzes every legal issue. It accurately describes the state action doctrine, the scope of EMTALA, the current interpretation of Section $1557$, the high bar for religious exemptions from emergency care laws, and the principle of federal preemption under the Supremacy Clause. This statement is legally and factually sound.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B: Emergency care is a traditional public function, making the hospital a state actor; therefore, the Equal Protection Clause applies and the refusal violates it. However, EMTALA does not apply when treatment conflicts with sincerely held religious beliefs, so the hospital is exempt.**\n    This option contains two major errors. First, courts have not generally held that providing hospital care constitutes an \"exclusive public function\" sufficient to create state action. Second, EMTALA contains no exemption for religious beliefs.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C: The patient cannot recover under EMTALA because it protects only uninsured individuals, and Section $1557$ does not cover gender identity. Moreover, the First Amendment categorically bars enforcement of federal health obligations that burden religious exercise, so HHS cannot act.**\n    This option is incorrect on all points. EMTALA protects all individuals, not just the uninsured. The current legal consensus is that Section $1557$'s prohibition on sex discrimination includes gender identity. The First Amendment does not create a categorical bar against enforcing neutral, generally applicable laws.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D: EMTALA obligations to screen and stabilize attach only after inpatient admission, so the hospital was permitted to refuse examination and stabilization in the emergency department. Constitutional equal protection duties attach to any entity that receives federal funds, so the patient’s constitutional claim is likely to succeed against the hospital.**\n    This option is fundamentally wrong about both EMTALA and the Constitution. EMTALA obligations attach upon arrival at the emergency department, *before* an admission decision. Receipt of federal funds alone does not convert a private entity into a state actor for constitutional purposes.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E: Even if federal law requires stabilization, the state conscience statute preempts EMTALA for cases involving moral objections, allowing the hospital to refuse treatment without federal consequence.**\n    This option incorrectly applies the doctrine of preemption. The Supremacy Clause means federal law (EMTALA) preempts conflicting state law, not the other way around. A state law cannot immunize an entity from federal liability.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4477577"}]}
