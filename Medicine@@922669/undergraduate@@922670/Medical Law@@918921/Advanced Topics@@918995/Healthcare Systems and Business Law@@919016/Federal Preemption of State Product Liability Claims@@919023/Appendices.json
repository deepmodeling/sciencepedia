{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The legal framework for generic drugs presents one of the clearest applications of impossibility preemption. Because federal law requires a generic drug to be identical in composition and labeling to its brand-name counterpart, a manufacturer is caught in a legal bind if state law demands a safer design. This practice challenges you to apply the landmark Supreme Court ruling in *Mutual Pharmaceutical Co. v. Bartlett* ($2013$) to understand why state-law design defect claims against generic manufacturers are typically preempted [@problem_id:4483418].", "problem": "A patient files a state-law design defect action against a manufacturer of a generic anti-inflammatory drug after suffering severe skin reactions. The brand-reference version of the drug remains on the market with the same active ingredient and the same labeling as when it was approved. The plaintiff’s expert opines that the product is unreasonably dangerous unless either the active ingredient is reformulated to reduce risk or the warning is strengthened beyond the brand-reference warning; alternatively, the expert testifies that the manufacturer could comply with state law by ceasing sales in the jurisdiction.\n\nAssume the following foundational legal principles:\n- Under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, a state requirement is preempted when it is impossible to comply with both federal and state duties at the same time.\n- The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations impose a “sameness” requirement on generic drugs, obligating the generic’s composition and labeling to match the brand-reference drug, and do not generally permit a generic manufacturer to unilaterally change the drug’s composition or labeling. By contrast, brand manufacturers may in some circumstances strengthen warnings via the Changes Being Effected (CBE) process.\n- A typical state design defect claim, applying a risk-utility framework, may require a manufacturer to adopt a safer alternative design, add warnings sufficient to render the product reasonably safe, or withdraw the product from the market.\n\nWhich option best defines Mutual Pharmaceutical Co. v. Bartlett ($2013$) and correctly explains, under that decision, why design defect claims against generic manufacturers are or are not preempted when the state-law duty would be satisfied only by changing the drug’s composition or label, or by ceasing to sell?\n\nA. Not preempted. Design defect claims regulate product composition rather than information, so they do not conflict with federal labeling rules. A generic may alter its formulation if therapeutic equivalence is preserved, satisfying state law without violating federal requirements.\n\nB. Not preempted. Generic manufacturers may unilaterally strengthen their labels using the Changes Being Effected process, so a state duty to add stronger warnings can be satisfied without violating federal law.\n\nC. Preempted. Federal sameness requirements make it impossible for a generic to unilaterally redesign the drug or strengthen its label to satisfy a state design duty; the “stop-selling” option does not defeat impossibility preemption. Mutual Pharmaceutical Co. v. Bartlett ($2013$) holds that such design defect claims are preempted because they effectively require changes the generic cannot make consistent with federal law.\n\nD. Not preempted if framed as failure to test or failure to seek agency action. A generic could petition the FDA to approve a label or design change, or simply withdraw the drug, so it remains possible to comply with both state and federal law.\n\nE. Preempted only if a state expressly mandates a label different from the brand-reference label. A general risk-utility design standard never creates a conflict with federal generic drug requirements.", "solution": "The analysis hinges on impossibility preemption. Federal law imposes a \"duty of sameness\" on generic drug manufacturers, requiring their products' composition and labeling to be identical to the brand-name counterpart. A generic manufacturer cannot unilaterally change either. In contrast, the plaintiff's state-law design defect claim, under a risk-utility standard, would require the manufacturer to change the drug's formulation (a different design) or strengthen its warning label to be deemed reasonably safe.\n\nThis creates an irreconcilable conflict: it is impossible for the manufacturer to simultaneously comply with the federal duty to *not* change its product and the state-law duty to *change* its product. The Supreme Court addressed this exact scenario in *Mutual Pharmaceutical Co. v. Bartlett* ($2013$), holding that such design defect claims are preempted. The Court also rejected the argument that the manufacturer could simply \"stop selling\" the drug to comply with state law, reasoning that this is not a method of compliance but rather an acknowledgment of the inability to comply with both federal and state law. Therefore, the claim is preempted.\n\n- **Option A is incorrect** because generic manufacturers cannot unilaterally alter their formulation, even if therapeutic equivalence is preserved. The duty is one of sameness.\n- **Option B is incorrect** because only brand-name manufacturers, not generics, can use the Changes Being Effected (CBE) process.\n- **Option C is correct** as it accurately summarizes the impossibility conflict and the holding in *Bartlett*, including the rejection of the \"stop-selling\" argument.\n- **Option D is incorrect** because the ability to petition the FDA or to stop selling does not resolve the impossibility of complying with conflicting duties, as established in *Bartlett*.\n- **Option E is incorrect** because a general common-law standard, not just an express state mandate, can create a conflict that gives rise to preemption.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4483418"}, {"introduction": "For Class III medical devices that undergo the rigorous Premarket Approval (PMA) process, the Medical Device Amendments (MDA) include a powerful express preemption clause that bars most state-law claims. However, a critical exception exists for so-called \"parallel claims.\" This exercise will test your ability to construct a viable legal theory that threads this needle, alleging a violation of a traditional state duty by pointing to the manufacturer's failure to meet its specific, pre-existing federal obligations [@problem_id:4483429].", "problem": "A patient is injured when the insulating sheath on the atrial lead of an implantable neurostimulator tears intraoperatively, causing unintended current flow and tissue damage. The device is a Class III implant that obtained Premarket Approval (PMA) from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The plaintiff brings a state-law product liability action. The defense moves to dismiss under $21$ United States Code ($21$ U.S.C.) $\\S 360k(a)$, arguing that the claim is expressly preempted by the Medical Device Amendments (MDA) to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). Assume the following foundational legal principles and facts:\n\n- Under $21$ U.S.C. $\\S 360k(a)$, no State may establish or continue in effect a requirement that is different from, or in addition to, federal requirements applicable to a medical device, insofar as the requirement relates to safety or effectiveness.\n- The Supreme Court has held that common-law duties can be “requirements” within the meaning of $21$ U.S.C. $\\S 360k(a)$, and that state-law claims targeting Premarket Approval (PMA) devices are expressly preempted unless they constitute “parallel claims” that genuinely mirror federal requirements without adding to them.\n- A “parallel claim” in this context is a traditional state-law cause of action (e.g., negligent manufacturing) whose duty and breach are defined by violation of a specific federal requirement already applicable to the device (such as a PMA condition or device-specific specification), and that does not impose obligations “different from, or in addition to” the federal scheme.\n- Under $21$ U.S.C. $\\S 337(a)$, enforcement of the FDCA is committed to the United States, and private claims that exist solely by virtue of the FDCA (e.g., “fraud-on-the-FDA”) are impliedly preempted.\n- The Quality System Regulation (QSR) at $21$ Code of Federal Regulations ($21$ C.F.R.) Part $820$ and Medical Device Reporting (MDR) at $21$ C.F.R. Part $803$ impose federal obligations on manufacturers, but a state-law claim must tie alleged violations to a cognizable state duty and a specific, device-related requirement to avoid both express and implied preemption.\n\nThe device’s PMA approval includes a “Condition $17$” stating that each production lot of atrial leads must pass a validated tensile pull test with a minimum break-strength of $20$ newtons ($20$ N) at the connector-crimp before release to market, and that any lot with fewer than $99.5\\%$ conforming units must be quarantined and reworked or destroyed. Internal records show the manufacturer released three lots in the year of implant without performing the tensile test, and post-release sampling revealed $4\\%$ sub-conforming units in one lot. The plaintiff alleges the torn lead originated from that lot.\n\nWhich option best constructs a “parallel claim” theory that survives $21$ U.S.C. $\\S 360k(a)$ express preemption (by alleging violation of a specific federal requirement without adding to it) and also avoids implied preemption under $21$ U.S.C. $\\S 337(a)$?\n\nA. Plead a state-law negligent manufacturing claim alleging the manufacturer breached the traditional duty to use reasonable care in production by failing to perform the PMA-mandated tensile pull test in Condition $17$ (minimum $20$ N; $99.5\\%$ conformity threshold), and that this violation proximately caused the lead failure and injury; seek compensatory damages.\n\nB. Plead a state-law failure-to-warn claim alleging the manufacturer should have added a new, stronger warning about “risk of intraoperative lead tear” to the device label and disseminated a “Dear Doctor” letter immediately, notwithstanding the FDA-approved PMA labeling; seek damages for inadequate warnings.\n\nC. Plead negligence per se under state law by asserting the manufacturer “violated Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP)” generally under $21$ C.F.R. Part $820$ without identifying any device-specific specification; seek an injunction compelling FDCA compliance and enhanced FDA oversight.\n\nD. Plead “fraud-on-the-FDA” under state law, alleging the manufacturer concealed adverse testing results during PMA and thereafter, and seek punitive damages for misrepresentations to the FDA.\n\nE. Plead a state-law design defect claim alleging the PMA-approved lead design is unreasonably dangerous because a thicker sheath (e.g., increased wall thickness by $0.5$ millimeters) would have prevented tearing; seek damages and an order requiring design changes beyond the PMA-approved specification.", "solution": "To survive preemption, a claim related to a PMA-approved device must be a \"parallel claim.\" This means it must be based on a traditional state-law cause of action (like negligence) but use a violation of a specific federal requirement as the basis for the breach of duty.\n\n- **Option A correctly constructs a parallel claim.** It pleads a traditional state tort (negligent manufacturing) and defines the breach of duty as the manufacturer's failure to adhere to a specific, binding federal requirement—Condition $17$ of its PMA approval. This claim does not impose a new or different requirement; it seeks to enforce the existing federal standard under state law. It also avoids implied preemption under *Buckman* because it is a genuine state tort claim, not a disguised attempt to privately enforce the FDCA.\n\n- **Option B is incorrect.** It alleges failure-to-warn and demands a warning different from the FDA-approved label. This is a classic example of a claim that is expressly preempted by $21$ U.S.C. $\\S 360k(a)$ under the *Riegel v. Medtronic* precedent.\n\n- **Option C is incorrect.** It alleges a general violation of CGMP regulations, which lacks the specificity required for a parallel claim. It also seeks an injunction to enforce the FDCA, a remedy that is impliedly preempted as it falls under the exclusive enforcement authority of the federal government.\n\n- **Option D is incorrect.** It pleads \"fraud-on-the-FDA,\" a claim that the Supreme Court in *Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs' Legal Committee* held is impliedly preempted because it attempts to police the relationship between a manufacturer and the FDA, an area reserved for federal oversight.\n\n- **Option E is incorrect.** It alleges a design defect and proposes an alternative design.

This key difference complicates a manufacturer's attempt to use an impossibility preemption defense against failure-to-warn claims. This scenario asks you to analyze a situation where a manufacturer fails to implement a federally mandated label change, exploring how such a delay can align federal and state duties and thereby defeat a preemption defense [@problem_id:4483392].", "problem": "A brand-name prescription drug manufacturer markets a cardiovascular drug. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued, under Section $355(o)(4)$ of Title $21$ of the United States Code, a binding safety labeling change order requiring the manufacturer to add a boxed warning about a newly identified risk. Let $t_0$ denote the date FDA communicated the order, $t_1$ denote the effective date by which the change must appear on the label, and $t_2$ denote the later date on which the manufacturer actually incorporated the change. A patient was injured at time $t_h$ where $t_1 \\leq t_h  t_2$. The patient brings a state common-law failure-to-warn claim, framed as a failure-to-update theory: the manufacturer breached a state duty to provide adequate warnings by continuing to distribute product with outdated labeling after $t_1$.\n\nAssume the following foundational legal principles as the base for analysis:\n- Under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, state law is preempted where compliance with both state and federal requirements is impossible. Define $C_F$ as the set of conduct that satisfies applicable federal duties, and $C_S$ as the set of conduct that satisfies applicable state duties; if $C_F \\cap C_S = \\emptyset$, impossibility preemption applies.\n- The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) has no private right of action; claims that exist solely by virtue of the FDCA and are premised on fraud-on-the-agency are impliedly preempted (Buckman Company v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Committee).\n- For brand-name drugs, federal regulations permit manufacturers to unilaterally strengthen safety labeling through the Changes Being Effected (CBE) process pending FDA review, such that a manufacturer can add or clarify risk information without prior FDA approval to address newly acquired information.\n- In Wyeth v. Levine, the United States Supreme Court held that state-law failure-to-warn claims against brand manufacturers are not preempted absent “clear evidence” that the FDA would have rejected the specific change required by state law; Merck Sharp  Dohme Corporation v. Albrecht clarified that “clear evidence” means agency action, taken pursuant to the FDA’s authorities and bearing the force of law, that would have prohibited the manufacturer from making the change.\n\nUnder these assumptions and the described timeline $(t_0, t_1, t_h, t_2)$, which option most accurately characterizes the federal preemption analysis of the patient’s state-law failure-to-update claim?\n\nA. The claim is preempted by impossibility under PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing because, at $t_h$, the manufacturer could not simultaneously comply with federal labeling requirements and state duties to warn; federal law required maintaining the existing label until FDA gave final approval of precise wording.\n\nB. The claim is not preempted: at $t_h$, federal law affirmatively permitted and, under Section $355(o)(4)$, required adding the boxed warning, so the manufacturer could have complied with both federal and state duties; the failure-to-update theory enforces an independent state duty to warn and does not exist solely by virtue of the FDCA.\n\nC. The claim is impliedly preempted under Buckman Company v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Committee because it depends on the existence of an FDA-ordered change and therefore is an impermissible private attempt to enforce the FDCA rather than an independent state duty.\n\nD. The claim is preempted under the “clear evidence” standard articulated in Merck Sharp  Dohme Corporation v. Albrecht because ongoing FDA negotiation over the exact label language at $t_h$ shows the agency would have rejected stronger warnings, rendering compliance with the state duty impossible.", "solution": "The preemption analysis for a brand-name drug hinges on whether it is impossible for the manufacturer to comply with both state and federal law. At the time of the patient's injury, $t_h$, federal and state duties were aligned.\n\n1.  **Federal Duty:** The FDA had issued a binding safety labeling change order under Section $355(o)(4)$ with an effective date of $t_1$. Since the injury occurred at $t_h$ (where $t_h \\ge t_1$), federal law affirmatively *required* the manufacturer to have already implemented the new boxed warning. Continuing to sell the product with the old label was a violation of federal law.\n\n2.  **State Duty:** The state common-law duty to warn would require the manufacturer to inform consumers and prescribers of the newly identified risk that prompted the FDA's order. Thus, state law also required the label to be updated.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Since both federal law and state law required the same conduct—updating the warning label—it was not impossible to comply with both. Therefore, impossibility preemption does not apply. The claim is also not a preempted \"private enforcement\" action under *Buckman* because the duty to warn is a traditional state-law duty that exists independently of the FDCA.\n\n- **Option A is incorrect** because it invokes the preemption standard for generic drugs (*Mensing*) and wrongly claims federal law required maintaining the old label.\n- **Option B is correct.** It accurately states that federal law required the label change at time $t_h$, making compliance with both state and federal duties possible. It also correctly notes that the claim is based on an independent state duty, thus avoiding *Buckman* preemption.\n- **Option C is incorrect** as it misapplies *Buckman*. The claim is rooted in an independent state-law duty to warn, not solely in a duty created by the FDCA.\n- **Option D is incorrect** because the \"clear evidence\" standard from *Wyeth/Albrecht* applies when a manufacturer argues the FDA would have rejected a warning.
