## Introduction
When a patient is injured by a medical drug or device, a critical legal question arises: can they sue the manufacturer under state law, or does federal regulation of that product prevent the lawsuit? This tension between state tort law and the comprehensive federal oversight by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is resolved by the doctrine of **federal preemption**. This article addresses the complex and often fragmented legal landscape created by preemption, explaining why a claim might succeed against one type of product but fail against a nearly identical one. By navigating the principles, applications, and practical challenges of preemption, you will gain a clear understanding of one of the most consequential doctrines in modern medical law.

This article is structured to build your expertise systematically. In "Principles and Mechanisms," you will learn the constitutional foundations of preemption and the distinct legal rules governing medical devices and prescription drugs. Next, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" will illustrate how these principles apply to real-world litigation scenarios, from mass torts to emerging technologies, and explore connections to public health and policy. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will challenge you to apply your knowledge to solve complex legal problems, solidifying your grasp of this critical subject. We begin by deconstructing the core principles that form the bedrock of all preemption analysis.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The intersection of federal regulation and state product liability law presents one of the most complex and consequential areas of modern medical law. When a patient is injured by a medical drug or device, the legal recourse they may seek through state tort law often collides with the comprehensive regulatory frameworks established by the federal government. This chapter examines the principles and mechanisms of **federal preemption**, the doctrine that resolves these conflicts by establishing the supremacy of federal law. We will deconstruct the constitutional foundations of preemption and explore its distinct application across the landscapes of medical devices and prescription drugs, revealing a nuanced legal terrain shaped by statutory text, regulatory processes, and landmark judicial interpretations.

### The Constitutional Foundation: Supremacy and the Forms of Preemption

The authority of federal law to displace state law originates in Article $VI$, Clause $2$ of the United States Constitution, commonly known as the **Supremacy Clause**. It declares that the Constitution, and the laws of the United States made in pursuance thereof, "shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Consequently, any state law that conflicts with a valid federal law is "without effect." The doctrine of federal preemption is the judicial application of this constitutional command.

Courts have identified several ways in which federal law can preempt state law, which are broadly categorized as either express or implied.

**Express preemption** is the most direct form. It occurs when the text of a federal statute explicitly states Congress's intent to displace state law. As we will see, this is the dominant form of preemption in the context of high-risk medical devices.

**Implied preemption** occurs when Congress's intent to preempt is not explicitly stated but is inferred from the structure and purpose of the federal law. There are two primary categories of implied preemption:

1.  **Field Preemption**: This arises when the scheme of federal regulation is so pervasive and comprehensive that it is reasonable to infer that Congress "left no room" for the states to supplement it. The Supreme Court has generally held that the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) does not occupy the entire field of medical product safety, leaving a significant role for state tort law. [@problem_id:4483343]

2.  **Conflict Preemption**: This is the most common form of implied preemption in medical product liability. A conflict exists where it is either impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements (**impossibility preemption**), or where the state law "stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress" (**obstacle preemption**). This form of preemption is central to the regulation of prescription drugs.

Understanding this [taxonomy](@entry_id:172984) is the essential first step to analyzing any preemption defense in a medical product liability case. The specific type of preemption at issue—and its likelihood of success—depends entirely on the product in question and the specific federal laws that govern it.

### Preemption in Medical Device Regulation: Express Preemption and the Parallel Claim

The regulatory framework for medical devices was established by the **Medical Device Amendments (MDA)** of $1976$ to the FDCA. Crucially, the MDA includes a powerful express preemption provision, codified at $21$ U.S.C. $\S 360k(a)$. This statute provides that no state may establish any **requirement** that is "**different from, or in addition to**" any federal requirement applicable to a medical device and that relates to its safety or effectiveness. [@problem_id:4483275] The Supreme Court's interpretation of this clause has created a stark dichotomy in preemption outcomes, turning entirely on the regulatory pathway a device takes to market.

#### The Decisive Role of the Regulatory Pathway

The FDA classifies medical devices into three categories based on risk: Class I (low risk), Class II (moderate risk), and Class III (high risk). The preemption analysis hinges on the pathway used for Class II and Class III devices.

The majority of Class II devices come to market through the **Section 510(k) premarket notification** process. This is a comparative pathway where a manufacturer demonstrates that its new device is "**substantially equivalent**" to a legally marketed predicate device. The FDA "clears" the device for marketing; it does not independently approve its safety and effectiveness. In *Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr* ($1996$), the Supreme Court held that the 510(k) process is generally not a device-specific federal "requirement" sufficient to trigger express preemption under $\S 360k(a)$. [@problem_id:4483268] Because the process is focused on equivalence rather than a direct federal finding of safety for the device itself, state-law product liability claims—such as for the negligent design of an orthopedic screw or pacemaker cleared via 510(k)—are generally **not preempted**. [@problem_id:4483409]

In stark contrast, Class III devices, which are those that support or sustain human life or present a potential, unreasonable risk of injury, typically undergo the most rigorous **Premarket Approval (PMA)** process. To obtain PMA, a manufacturer must provide the FDA with a "reasonable assurance of [the device’s] safety and effectiveness," supported by extensive scientific and clinical data. In *Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc.* ($2008$), the Supreme Court held that this intensive, device-specific review *does* impose federal requirements. [@problem_id:4483461] The FDA’s approval of a device’s specific design, manufacturing process, and labeling constitutes a set of binding federal "requirements." The Court also affirmed that state common-law duties, such as those enforced through a jury verdict, are also "requirements."

Therefore, for a PMA-approved device like an implantable cardiac stent, state-law claims for design defect or failure-to-warn are expressly preempted. [@problem_id:4483461] A jury verdict finding that the device should have had a different design or a stronger warning would impose a requirement "different from, or in addition to" the very design and label the FDA specifically approved. Such claims are barred by $\S 360k(a)$.

#### The Narrow Exception: "Parallel Claims"

The holding in *Riegel* did not eliminate all state-law recourse for patients injured by PMA-approved devices. The Court preserved a narrow but critical exception for "**parallel claims**." A parallel claim is a state-law claim that is premised on a violation of the FDA's *own* requirements. The logic is that such a claim does not impose a duty "different from, or in addition to" federal law; it seeks to enforce a duty that is equivalent, or "parallel," to it.

For a parallel claim to survive, a plaintiff must navigate a narrow channel between two forms of preemption. [@problem_id:4483309] First, to avoid express preemption under *Riegel*, the claim must not challenge the FDA-approved specifications but must instead allege that the manufacturer violated those very specifications. For example, a claim that a manufacturer negligently deviated from the FDA-approved manufacturing process, resulting in a defective device, would be a classic parallel claim.

Second, to avoid implied preemption, the claim must be a genuine state-law cause of action (e.g., negligence) and not a disguised attempt to privately enforce the FDCA. In *Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Committee* ($2001$), the Supreme Court held that claims of "**fraud-on-the-FDA**"—allegations that a defendant's misrepresentations to the agency led to improper clearance or approval—are impliedly preempted. [@problem_id:4483448] The Court reasoned that such claims exist solely by virtue of the federal regulatory scheme, and that the FDCA's enforcement provision, $\S 337(a)$, reserves the authority to police the integrity of the FDA's processes to the federal government alone. Allowing private state-law fraud-on-the-FDA claims would stand as an obstacle to this federal objective.

Thus, a viable parallel claim must be rooted in a traditional state-law duty but use the federal requirement as the standard of care. A plaintiff must identify a specific, device-specific federal requirement, allege a plausible violation of that requirement, and causally connect that violation to their injury under a cognizable state tort theory. [@problem_id:4483309]

### Preemption in Prescription Drug Regulation: The Primacy of Conflict Preemption

Unlike the MDA for devices, the FDCA contains no express preemption clause for prescription drugs. Consequently, the analysis shifts entirely to the doctrines of implied conflict preemption, yielding a different but equally stark divergence based on the type of drug at issue: brand-name or generic.

#### Brand-Name Drugs and the *Wyeth* Framework

For brand-name drugs, the landmark case is *Wyeth v. Levine* ($2009$). The Supreme Court held that state-law failure-to-warn claims against brand-name drug manufacturers are generally **not preempted**. [@problem_id:4483373] The manufacturer in *Wyeth* argued for impossibility preemption, asserting it could not simultaneously comply with its FDA-approved label and a state-law duty to provide a stronger warning. The Court rejected this argument by pointing to a specific regulatory mechanism: the "**Changes Being Effected**" (CBE) regulation.

The CBE regulation allows a brand-name manufacturer to unilaterally strengthen a drug's warning label to reflect newly acquired safety information *before* receiving formal FDA approval for the change. Because manufacturers have this federally authorized power to change their labels, it is not impossible for them to comply with a state-law duty to warn. The federal scheme, the Court reasoned, establishes a floor, not a ceiling, for drug safety warnings, and state tort law provides a complementary layer of protection.

Preemption for a brand-name drug is therefore possible only in a narrow circumstance: where the manufacturer can provide "**clear evidence**" that the FDA would have rejected the specific warning that the plaintiff alleges state law requires. In *Merck Sharp  Dohme Corp. v. Albrecht* ($2019$), the Court clarified this standard, holding that the determination of whether such "clear evidence" exists is a **question of law for a judge**, not a question of fact for a jury. [@problem_id:4483271] This evidence must show that the FDA, after being fully informed of the risks, rejected the proposed warning change.

#### Generic Drugs and the *Mensing* Impossibility

The legal landscape is completely different for generic drugs. In *PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing* ($2011$), the Supreme Court held that state-law failure-to-warn claims against generic drug manufacturers **are preempted** by impossibility. [@problem_id:4483284] The dispositive factor is the federal "**duty of sameness**."

Under the Hatch-Waxman Act and FDA regulations, a generic drug's labeling must be the same as that of its brand-name counterpart, the reference listed drug. Crucially, generic manufacturers cannot use the CBE process to unilaterally change their labels. If a generic manufacturer were to strengthen its warning to comply with a state-law duty, its label would no longer be the "same as" the brand-name label, and its product would be misbranded under federal law.

This creates an irreconcilable conflict. It is impossible for a generic manufacturer to simultaneously obey the state-law duty to change its label and the federal-law duty *not* to change its label. This impossibility leads to preemption. The same logic was later extended to design-defect claims, creating a broad shield of preemption for generic drug manufacturers that does not exist for their brand-name counterparts.

In sum, the principles and mechanisms of federal preemption create a complex and fragmented landscape for medical product liability. The legal outcome of a patient's claim for injury depends critically on the specific product, its regulatory history, and the precise nature of the state-law claim being asserted. For medical devices, the analysis is driven by express preemption and the distinction between the 510(k) and PMA pathways. For prescription drugs, the analysis is one of implied conflict preemption, hinging on whether the manufacturer is a brand-name company with the power to change its label or a generic company bound by the duty of sameness.
