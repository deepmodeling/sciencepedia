Regulators apply a structural presumption of harm when a merger significantly increases market concentration in an already concentrated market, commonly operationalized by the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI), and then examine whether claimed efficiencies are merger-specific, verifiable, and likely to benefit patients through lower prices or improved quality. Under the consumer welfare standard, the merging parties must show that any efficiency gains are passed through to patients sufficiently to prevent a net increase in prices.\n\nAssume the following, consistent with standard microeconomic treatment of pass-through in price-setting for homogeneous services:\n- Baseline pre-merger price is $p_{0}$.\n- Absent efficiencies, standard bargaining and unilateral effects modeling predicts a post-merger price of $p_{0}(1 + \\alpha)$, where $\\alpha = 0.06$ is the expected proportional price increase from reduced competition.\n- The merging parties claim verifiable marginal cost savings equal to a proportional reduction $\\beta = 0.03$ relative to $p_{0}$.\n- Define the pass-through rate $\\tau$ as the proportion of marginal cost reductions that are transmitted into lower transaction prices paid by patients. A value of $\\tau$ in $[0,1]$ reflects full to zero pass-through under conventional assumptions.\n\nStarting only from these core definitions and the consumer welfare criterion that the net post-merger price should be no higher than $p_{0}$ for efficiencies to rebut the structural presumption of harm, derive the minimum pass-through rate $\\tau^{*}$ such that the claimed efficiencies exactly neutralize the predicted anticompetitive price effect.

The consumer welfare criterion dictates that the net post-merger price must be no higher than the pre-merger price. For exact neutralization, the net post-merger price must be equal to the pre-merger price.\n\nLet us define the variables as provided:\n- $p_0$ is the baseline pre-merger price.\n- $\\alpha = 0.06$ is the proportional price increase anticipated due to reduced competition (unilateral and bargaining effects), absent any efficiencies.\n- $\\beta = 0.03$ is the proportional marginal cost saving relative to the pre-merger price, $p_0$.\n- $\\tau$ is the pass-through rate, representing the fraction of marginal cost savings that are passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices.\n\nFirst, we establish the predicted post-merger price in the absence of any efficiencies. This price, let us call it $p_{ac}$ (for anti-competitive), is given by a proportional increase $\\alpha$ over the initial price $p_0$:\n$$p_{ac} = p_0 (1 + \\alpha)$$\n\nNext, we quantify the effect of the claimed efficiencies. The problem states that the merging parties claim verifiable marginal cost savings equal to a proportional reduction $\\beta$ relative to $p_0$. This means the absolute value of the marginal cost reduction, $\\Delta MC$, is:\n$$\\Delta MC = \\beta p_0$$\n\nThe pass-through rate, $\\tau$, determines what portion of this cost saving is translated into a price reduction for consumers. The absolute price reduction resulting from the passed-through efficiencies, $\\Delta p_{eff}$, is therefore:\n$$\\Delta p_{eff} = \\tau \\times \\Delta MC = \\tau (\\beta p_0)$$\n\nThe net post-merger price, $p_{net}$, is the result of the initial price increase from reduced competition, offset by the price decrease from passed-through efficiencies. We can express this by subtracting the efficiency-related price reduction from the anti-competitive price level:\n$$p_{net} = p_{ac} - \\Delta p_{eff}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $p_{ac}$ and $\\Delta p_{eff}$:\n$$p_{net} = p_0(1 + \\alpha) - \\tau \\beta p_0$$\n\nThe problem requires us to find the specific pass-through rate, $\\tau^*$, at which the claimed efficiencies *exactly neutralize* the predicted anticompetitive price effect. This condition of exact neutralization corresponds to the net post-merger price being equal to the original pre-merger price:\n$$p_{net} = p_0$$\n\nWe can now set up the equation to solve for $\\tau^*$:\n$$p_0 = p_0(1 + \\alpha) - \\tau^* \\beta p_0$$\n\nSince $p_0$ represents a market price, it must be a positive value ($p_0 > 0$). Therefore, we can divide the entire equation by $p_0$ without loss of generality:\n$$1 = (1 + \\alpha) - \\tau^* \\beta$$\n\nNow, we solve for $\\tau^*$.\n$$1 = 1 + \\alpha - \\tau^* \\beta$$\nSubtracting $1$ from both sides gives:\n$$0 = \\alpha - \\tau^* \\beta$$\nRearranging the terms to isolate $\\tau^*$:\n$$\\tau^* \\beta = \\alpha$$\n$$\\tau^* = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}$$\n\nThe final step is to substitute the given numerical values for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:\n$$\\alpha = 0.06$$\n$$\\beta = 0.03$$\n\nPlugging these into our derived expression for $\\tau^*$:\n$$\\tau^* = \\frac{0.06}{0.03}$$\n$$\\tau^* = 2$$\n\nThis result indicates that the pass-through rate must be $2$. While the problem notes that a conventional pass-through rate $\\tau$ is in the range $[0, 1]$, the derived value of $\\tau^* = 2$ is the correct mathematical consequence of the given parameters and the neutralization criterion.
