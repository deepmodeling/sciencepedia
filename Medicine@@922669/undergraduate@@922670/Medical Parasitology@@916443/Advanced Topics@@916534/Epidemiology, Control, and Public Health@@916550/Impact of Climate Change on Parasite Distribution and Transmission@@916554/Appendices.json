Since the daily temperature $T = 23^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ is greater than the base temperature $T_b = 15^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, development occurs. The contribution for one day is:\n$$\\text{Daily Accumulation} = \\max(T - T_{b}, 0) = \\max(23 - 15, 0) = \\max(8, 0) = 8$$\nThe units of this value are degree-days.\n\nNext, we calculate the total degree-days, $DD$, accumulated over the $D = 10$ day period. As the temperature is constant, the daily accumulation is the same for each day.\n$$DD = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} (8)$$\nThis simplifies to a multiplication:\n$$DD = 10 \\times 8 = 80$$\nThe total accumulated thermal energy over the $10$-day period is $80$ degree-days.\n\nThe problem asks for the surplus, $S$, which is defined as the difference between the accumulated degree-days, $DD$, and the required degree-days, $R$.\n$$S = DD - R$$\nSubstituting the calculated value of $DD$ and the given value of $R$:\n$$S = 80 - 80 = 0$$\nThe surplus is exactly $0$ degree-days. According to the condition for completion, $S \\geq 0$, the parasite has accumulated the exact amount of thermal energy required to complete its development to the infective stage by the end of the $10$-day period.

The problem specifies no dispersal limitation and continuous suitable habitat. These are ideal assumptions meaning the parasite can move as fast as needed and there are no barriers to its movement. Under these conditions, the parasite can perfectly track its moving thermal niche. Therefore, the climate velocity $v$ sets the exact magnitude of the parasite's range boundary shift.
