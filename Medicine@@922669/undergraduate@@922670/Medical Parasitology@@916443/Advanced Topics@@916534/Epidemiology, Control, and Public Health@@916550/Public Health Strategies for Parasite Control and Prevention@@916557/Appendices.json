It presents a standard biostatistical sample size calculation problem with realistic parameters and clear definitions. There are no scientific flaws, ambiguities, or missing information.\n\nThe task is to determine the minimum total number of individuals, $n_{\\text{tot}}$, to be enrolled in a cluster-based survey to achieve a specified precision for a prevalence estimate. The solution involves a two-step process: first, calculating the required sample size for a simple random sample ($n$) based on the Wilson score interval, and second, adjusting this sample size to account for the clustering using the given design effect.\n\nStep 1: Sample Size for a Simple Random Sample ($n$)\n\nThe Wilson score interval for a binomial proportion $p$ is derived from inverting the score test.

The minimum integer sample size for a simple random sample is $n = 320$.\n\nStep 2: Adjust for Cluster Sampling\n\nThe survey design is not a simple random sample but a cluster sample. The correlation among individuals within a cluster reduces the statistical information per individual. This effect is quantified by the design effect, $D$.\nThe problem provides the formula for the design effect: $D = 1 + \\rho (m - 1)$.\nThe givens are the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) $\\rho = 0.05$ and the average cluster size $m = 20$.\n$$ D = 1 + 0.05 (20 - 1) = 1 + 0.05(19) = 1 + 0.95 = 1.95 $$\nTo achieve the same precision as a simple random sample of size $n$, the total sample size for the cluster design, $n_{\\text{tot}}$, must be inflated by the design effect. The relationship is given by:\n$$ n_{\\text{tot}} = n \\times D $$\nUsing the required simple random sample size $n = 320$ and the calculated design effect $D = 1.95$:\n$$ n_{\\text{tot}} = 320 \\times 1.95 = 624 $$\nThe result is an integer. Thus, the minimum total number of individuals that must be enrolled is $624$. We can verify that an effective sample size of $n_{\\text{eff}} = 624 / 1.95 = 320$ satisfies the precision requirement, while an enrollment of $623$ would yield an effective sample size of $623/1.95 \\approx 319.49 < 319.584$, which would be insufficient.\n\nThe final answer is the minimum integer total number of individuals required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{624}$$", "id": "4810565"}, {"introduction": "With a clear picture of disease prevalence, the next step is to design an effective intervention. This practice connects a core epidemiological principle, the basic reproduction number ($R_0$), to a critical operational question: what percentage of the population must we treat to stop transmission?

The problem provides the basic reproduction number $R_{0}$, which is the expected number of secondary cases from a single infection in a completely susceptible population, and the efficacy $e$ of the anthelminthic drug, which reduces an individual's contribution to transmission.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the relationship between the basic reproduction number $R_{0}$ and the effective reproduction number $R_{e}$ under the intervention. The population is divided into two subgroups: a fraction $c$ that is treated and a fraction $(1-c)$ that is untreated. The problem states to assume homogeneous mixing, which means that an infectious individual is equally likely to contact any other individual in the population, regardless of their treatment status.\n\nThe effective reproduction number $R_{e}$ is the average number of secondary cases produced by a typical infectious individual in this mixed population. An infectious individual from the untreated group will, on average, cause $R_{0}$ secondary infections. An infectious individual from the treated group has their contribution to onward transmission reduced by the drug's efficacy $e$. Thus, their transmission potential is reduced by a factor of $e$, and they contribute $(1-e)$ of what an untreated individual would. Therefore, an infectious individual from the treated group will, on average, cause $R_{0}(1-e)$ secondary infections.\n\n$R_{e}$ is the weighted average of the contributions from these two types of infectious individuals, weighted by their respective proportions in the population:\n$$R_{e} = (1-c) \\cdot R_{0} + c \\cdot \\left[R_{0}(1-e)\\right]$$\nThis expression represents the aggregation over the treated and untreated subpopulations, as specified in the problem statement.

The condition is:\n$$R_{e} < 1$$\nSubstituting our expression for $R_{e}$ into this inequality gives:\n$$R_{0}(1 - ce) < 1$$\n\nWe now solve this inequality for the coverage $c$. Since $R_{0}=2.5 > 0$, we can divide by $R_{0}$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$1 - ce < \\frac{1}{R_{0}}$$\nRearranging the terms to isolate $c$:\n$$1 - \\frac{1}{R_{0}} < ce$$\nSince the efficacy $e=0.9 > 0$, we can divide by $e$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$c > \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{R_{0}}}{e}$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$c > \\frac{\\frac{R_{0}-1}{R_{0}}}{e} = \\frac{R_{0}-1}{eR_{0}}$$\nThis inequality gives the condition on the coverage $c$ required to ensure $R_{e} < 1$.

Let $p_t$ be the frequency of the resistant allele $\\mathrm{R}$ in generation $t$, and $q_t$ be the frequency of the susceptible allele $\\mathrm{S}$. By definition, $p_t + q_t = 1$.

A $\\Delta p$ of approximately $0.0009890$ means the frequency of the resistant allele increases by nearly $0.1$ percentage points in a single parasite generation. For many parasites, generation times are short, so this indicates a rapid selection for resistance under the specified drug pressure. This rapid increase has significant implications for control program design:\n1.  **Drug Rotation**: The fast rise of resistance against the current drug implies its useful lifespan is limited. A strategy of rotating to a different class of drug after a certain period may be necessary to manage the spread of resistance.\n2.  **Combination Therapy**: The strong selective advantage of the single resistance allele highlights the vulnerability of monotherapy. Using two or more drugs with different mechanisms of action simultaneously (combination therapy) makes it exponentially more difficult for a parasite to evolve resistance, as it would need to acquire multiple, independent resistance mutations. This result provides a quantitative argument in favor of deploying combination therapies from the outset.\n3.  **Refugia**: The speed of selection underscores the importance of refugia—a subpopulation of parasites not exposed to the drug. These parasites, being predominantly drug-susceptible, slow the overall increase in resistance frequency in the total parasite population by competing with and diluting the resistant parasites. The calculated rate of change helps quantify how quickly resistance would spread in the absence of such refugia, informing policies on the extent of MDA coverage (e.g., targeted vs. universal treatment) to balance therapeutic benefit with resistance management.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.0009890}\n$$", "id": "4810561"}]}
