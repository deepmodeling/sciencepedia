The leverage of a parameter corresponds to the magnitude of its elasticity, $|E_x|$. A larger magnitude implies that a given proportional change in the parameter will have a greater proportional effect on $R_0$. To reduce $R_0$, one would decrease parameters with positive elasticity and increase parameters with negative elasticity.\n\nThe magnitudes of the derived elasticities are:\n$|E_a| = |2| = 2$\n$|E_m| = |1| = 1$\n$|E_b| = |1| = 1$\n$|E_c| = |1| = 1$\n$|E_{\\mu_v}| = |-1 - \\mu_v n| = 1 + \\mu_v n$ (since $\\mu_v > 0$ and $n > 0$)\n$|E_r| = |-1| = 1$\n$|E_n| = |-\\mu_v n| = \\mu_v n$\n\nThe ranking of these magnitudes depends on the value of the dimensionless product $\\mu_v n$, which represents the probability that a mosquito perishes during the extrinsic incubation period.\nWe can establish a partial ordering:\n$|E_{\\mu_v}| = 1 + \\mu_v n  2$ if $\\mu_v n  1$.\n$|E_{\\mu_v}| = 1 + \\mu_v n  2$ if $\\mu_v n  1$.\n$|E_{n}| = \\mu_v n$ could be greater or less than $1$.\n\nGiven that all parameters are positive:\n$|E_{\\mu_v}| = 1 + \\mu_v n  1$.\n$|E_{\\mu_v}| = 1 + \\mu_v n  |E_{n}| = \\mu_v n$.\nThis means that the mosquito mortality rate ($\\mu_v$) always has greater leverage than the extrinsic incubation period ($n$).\n\nThe ranking depends on the comparison of $\\{|E_a|, |E_{\\mu_v}|, |E_n|\\}$ with each other and with $1$.\nThe highest leverage belongs to either $a$ (if $\\mu_v n  1$) or $\\mu_v$ (if $\\mu_v n  1$). In either case, these two parameters offer the greatest potential for control.\nThe parameters $m, b, c, r$ all have an elasticity magnitude of $1$. The rank of $n$ relative to this group depends on whether $\\mu_v n$ is greater than, equal to, or less than $1$.\n\nFor example, in a scenario where $\\mu_v n  1$, we have $|E_{\\mu_v}|  |E_a|=2$ since $1+\\mu_v n  2$, and $|E_n|  1$. The ranking from highest to lowest leverage would be: $\\mu_v, a, n$, followed by the group $\\{m, b, c, r\\}$ which are tied.\nIn a scenario where $\\mu_v n  1$, we have $|E_a|=2  |E_{\\mu_v}| = 1 + \\mu_v n$, and $|E_n|  1$. The ranking would be: $a, \\mu_v$, followed by the group $\\{m, b, c, r\\}$, and finally $n$.\n\nThe squared term for the biting rate $a$ ($E_a=2$) highlights its significant impact, reflecting that biting is required for both transmission from human to mosquito and from mosquito to human. The leverage of mosquito mortality rate $\\mu_v$ is also substantial, as increasing it both reduces the overall mosquito population density (implicit in $m$) and decreases the chance that an infected mosquito will survive the incubation period to become infectious (the $\\exp(-\\mu_v n)$ term).\n\nThe final answer requires only the matrix of elasticities.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2  1  1  1  -1 - \\mu_v n  -1  -\\mu_v n \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4800076"}, {"introduction": "Mathematical models often begin with simplifying assumptions, such as linear relationships between variables.

The Entomological Inoculation Rate (EIR) is defined as the rate of infectious bites received per host per unit time. In the absence of host defensive saturation, the baseline model assumes a linear relationship: the attempted biting rate per mosquito is $a$ (in bites per mosquito per day), the mosquito-to-human ratio is $m$ (mosquitoes per host), and the fraction of mosquitoes that are infectious is $i_{v}$ (dimensionless). Under this linear assumption, the successful biting rate per host equals the attempted rate $a m$, and infectious bites occur at rate $i_{v}$ times the successful biting rate. However, field observations indicate that human defensive behavior (e.g., swatting and avoidance) saturates as mosquito pressure increases. Assume this saturation can be described by a Holling type II functional response: the successful biting rate per host is the attempted rate moderated by a handling time parameter $\\alpha$ (with units of days per bite), so that increasing $a m$ leads to a saturating rather than linear increase in successful bite rate.

Substituting this into the numerator:\n$$ E_\\beta = \\frac{\\gamma(1 + \\alpha i^\\ast)}{i^\\ast(\\beta + \\gamma \\alpha)} $$\nDifferentiate the equilibrium condition with respect to $\\gamma$:\n$$ \\beta\\left(-\\frac{\\partial i^\\ast}{\\partial \\gamma}\\right) - \\left[ (1)(1 + \\alpha i^\\ast) + \\gamma\\left(\\alpha \\frac{\\partial i^\\ast}{\\partial \\gamma}\\right) \\right] = 0 $$\n$$ -(\\beta + \\gamma \\alpha)\\frac{\\partial i^\\ast}{\\partial \\gamma} = 1 + \\alpha i^\\ast \\implies \\frac{\\partial i^\\ast}{\\partial \\gamma} = - \\frac{1 + \\alpha i^\\ast}{\\beta + \\gamma \\alpha} $$\nThe elasticity $E_\\gamma$ is:\n$$ E_\\gamma = \\frac{\\partial i^\\ast}{\\partial \\gamma} \\frac{\\gamma}{i^\\ast} = - \\frac{1 + \\alpha i^\\ast}{\\beta + \\gamma \\alpha} \\frac{\\gamma}{i^\\ast} = - \\frac{\\gamma(1 + \\alpha i^\\ast)}{i^\\ast(\\beta + \\gamma \\alpha)} $$\nThus, for saturating incidence, we also find $E_\\gamma = -E_\\beta$, and their magnitudes are equal: $|E_\\beta| = |E_\\gamma|$.\n\n**3. Numerical Evaluation**\nParameters: $\\beta = 0.6\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$, $\\gamma = 0.3\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$, $\\alpha = 2$.\nThe condition $\\beta  \\gamma$ ($0.6  0.3$) is met.\n\n*   **Mass-Action Model:**\n    -   $i^\\ast_{MA} = 1 - \\dfrac{0.3}{0.6} = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$.\n    -   $E_\\beta = \\dfrac{0.3}{0.6 - 0.3} = \\dfrac{0.3}{0.3} = 1$.\n    -   $E_\\gamma = -1$.\n    -   Magnitude: $|E_\\beta| = |E_\\gamma| = 1$.\n\n*   **Saturating Incidence Model:**\n    -   $i^\\ast_{Sat} = \\dfrac{0.6 - 0.3}{0.6 + (0.3)(2)} = \\dfrac{0.3}{0.6 + 0.6} = \\dfrac{0.3}{1.2} = 0.25$.\n    -   To calculate elasticities, we can use the expressions derived or substitute numerical values into the final formula for $E_\\beta$. Using the explicit formula for $E_\\beta$ derived from the $i^*$ expression:\n        $E_\\beta = \\dfrac{\\gamma \\beta (1 + \\alpha)}{(\\beta + \\gamma \\alpha)(\\beta - \\gamma)} = \\dfrac{(0.3)(0.6)(1+2)}{(0.6+(0.3)(2))(0.6-0.3)} = \\dfrac{(0.18)(3)}{(1.2)(0.3)} = \\dfrac{0.54}{0.36} = 1.5$.\n    -   $E_\\gamma = -E_\\beta = -1.5$.\n    -   Magnitude: $|E_\\beta| = |E_\\gamma| = 1.5$.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n-   $i^\\ast_{MA} = 0.5$ and $i^\\ast_{Sat} = 0.25$.\n-   For mass-action: $|E_\\beta| = |E_\\gamma| = 1$.\n-   For saturating incidence: $|E_\\beta| = |E_\\gamma| = 1.5$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A) For these parameters, endemic prevalence is lower under saturating incidence than under mass-action; within each incidence form, the elasticity magnitudes with respect to $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ are equal, so a given percent reduction in $\\beta$ or a given percent increase in $\\gamma$ produces the same proportional change in $i^\\ast$; the proportional impact is larger under saturating incidence, implying higher returns to percent-based interventions, with no difference between targeting $\\beta$ versus $\\gamma$.**\n-   \"endemic prevalence is lower under saturating incidence\": $i^\\ast_{Sat} = 0.25  i^\\ast_{MA} = 0.5$. This is **Correct**.\n-   \"within each incidence form, the elasticity magnitudes with respect to $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ are equal\": For MA, $|E_\\beta| = |E_\\gamma| = 1$. For Sat, $|E_\\beta| = |E_\\gamma| = 1.5$. This is **Correct**.\n-   \"so a given percent reduction in $\\beta$ or a given percent increase in $\\gamma$ produces the same proportional change in $i^\\ast$\": The proportional change is $\\Delta i^\\ast/i^\\ast \\approx E_p (\\Delta p/p)$. A reduction in $\\beta$ by $k\\%$ gives a change of $E_\\beta(-k/100)$. An increase in $\\gamma$ by $k\\%$ gives a change of $E_\\gamma(k/100)$. Since $E_\\gamma = -E_\\beta$, the change is $-E_\\beta(k/100)$ in both cases. The proportional change is the same. This is **Correct**.\n-   \"the proportional impact is larger under saturating incidence\": The magnitude of elasticity measures proportional impact. $|E|_{Sat} = 1.5  |E|_{MA} = 1$. This is **Correct**.\n-   \"implying higher returns to percent-based interventions, with no difference between targeting $\\beta$ versus $\\gamma$\": The first part is a correct implication of the larger elasticity. The second part is correct because $|E_\\beta| = |E_\\gamma|$ in each model. This is **Correct**.\nAll parts of this statement are correct.\n\n**B) For these parameters, a $10\\%$ reduction in $\\beta$ yields a larger proportional reduction in endemic prevalence than a_10% increase in $\\gamma$ under mass-action, but under saturating incidence the $10\\%$ increase in $\\gamma$ is more effective than the $10\\%$ reduction in $\\beta$.**\n-   We have shown that for both mass-action and saturating incidence, $|E_\\beta| = |E_\\gamma|$. This means, for a given model, a $10\\%$ reduction in $\\beta$ and a $10\\%$ increase in $\\gamma$ produce the exact same magnitude of proportional change in $i^\\ast$. The statement claims they are different. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C) For these parameters, elasticity magnitudes are smaller under saturating incidence than under mass-action, so per percent change, interventions have diminished returns when contacts saturate.**\n-   Our calculations show the elasticity magnitude for saturating incidence is $1.5$, while for mass-action it is $1$. Since $1.5  1$, the elasticity magnitude is *larger* under saturating incidence, not smaller. This statement is factually opposite to the results. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D) For these parameters, endemic prevalence and elasticities are identical under the two incidence forms, so the choice of incidence does not affect intervention impact.**\n-   Endemic prevalences are $i^\\ast_{MA} = 0.5$ and $i^\\ast_{Sat} = 0.25$, which are not identical.\n-   Elasticity magnitudes are $|E|_{MA} = 1$ and $|E|_{Sat} = 1.5$, which are not identical.\n-   This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, statement A is the only one that is fully consistent with the derived and calculated results.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4800088"}]}
