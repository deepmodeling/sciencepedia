The analysis will proceed by first determining the requirement for each stage separately and then calculating their ratio, based on the provided definitions.\n\nLet $N_s$ be the number of sporozoites that establish liver infection, and $N_m$ be the total number of merozoites that arise from the liver stage. We are given the values:\n$$N_s = 10$$\n$$N_m = 10^{11}$$\n\nThe problem defines the effect of a vaccine as reducing the parasite count $N$ at a given stage by a multiplicative factor $r$. The post-vaccination parasite count is thus $\\frac{N}{r}$.\n\nSterile protection is defined as the condition where the expected number of viable parasites proceeding past the targeted stage is less than $1$. To find the minimum fold-reduction $r_{\\text{min}}$ required to achieve this, we analyze the boundary condition where the expected number of viable parasites is exactly $1$.\n$$\\frac{N_{\\text{target}}}{r_{\\text{min}}} = 1$$\nThis implies that the minimum required fold-reduction is equal to the initial number of parasites at the targeted stage:\n$$r_{\\text{min}} = N_{\\text{target}}$$\n\nPart 1: Minimum fold-reduction for the pre-erythrocytic stage ($r_{s, \\text{min}}$)\nFor a vaccine targeting the pre-erythrocytic stage, the parasite population to be controlled is the sporozoites, $N_s$. The parasites \"proceeding past\" this stage are the ones that successfully establish liver infection. The number of these is $N_s$. Therefore, $N_{\\text{target}} = N_s$.\nThe minimum required fold-reduction, $r_{s, \\text{min}}$, is found by setting the post-vaccination count of successful sporozoites to $1$:\n$$\\frac{N_s}{r_{s, \\text{min}}} = 1$$\n$$r_{s, \\text{min}} = N_s$$\nSubstituting the given value, we get:\n$$r_{s, \\text{min}} = 10$$\n\nPart 2: Minimum fold-reduction for the blood stage ($r_{m, \\text{min}}$)\nFor a vaccine targeting the blood stage, the parasite population to be controlled is the merozoites, $N_m$. \"Proceeding past\" this stage means establishing a patent blood-stage infection. Within the context of the model, this requires at least one viable merozoite. Thus, the target population is $N_m$, and $N_{\\text{target}} = N_m$.\nThe minimum required fold-reduction, $r_{m, \\text{min}}$, is found by setting the post-vaccination count of merozoites to $1$:\n$$\\frac{N_m}{r_{m, \\text{min}}} = 1$$\n$$r_{m, \\text{min}} = N_m$$\nSubstituting the given value, we get:\n$$r_{m, \\text{min}} = 10^{11}$$\n\nPart 3: Ratio of the requirements\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the blood-stage requirement to the pre-erythrocytic requirement. This is the ratio $\\frac{r_{m, \\text{min}}}{r_{s, \\text{min}}}$.\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{r_{m, \\text{min}}}{r_{s, \\text{min}}} = \\frac{N_m}{N_s}$$\nUsing the determined values for $r_{m, \\text{min}}$ and $r_{s, \\text{min}}$:\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{10^{11}}{10} = 10^{11-1} = 10^{10}$$\n\nThe final answer is $10^{10}$, which represents how many times greater the necessary fold-reduction is for a blood-stage vaccine compared to a pre-erythrocytic stage vaccine to achieve sterile protection under this model.

This practice delves into this challenge by modeling a vaccine against the polymorphic Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA1) of malaria.

For a randomly selected infection in this region, the probability that its AMA1 haplotype is a specific type equals that haplotype’s allele frequency. Consider the following data and assumptions grounded in standard probabilistic modeling of vaccine coverage and allele-specific immunity.\n\nGiven:\n- The three circulating AMA1 haplotypes $H_{1}$, $H_{2}$, and $H_{3}$ have allele frequencies $f_{1} = 0.52$, $f_{2} = 0.33$, and $f_{3} = 0.15$, respectively, so that $f_{1} + f_{2} + f_{3} = 1$.\n- If the vaccine includes a component exactly matching the infecting haplotype, the probability of protection is an allele-specific efficacy $e = 0.85$.\n- If the vaccine does not include a component exactly matching the infecting haplotype, each included component confers independent partial cross-protection with probability $c = 0.20$ against that non-matched haplotype.

All necessary parameters are provided, and the objective is clearly defined. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to calculate the marginal increase in expected strain coverage when moving from the best possible bivalent vaccine to a trivalent vaccine. The expected strain coverage is defined as the probability of protection against a randomly selected infection, where the infecting haplotype is drawn according to the given allele frequencies.\n\nLet $V$ be the set of haplotypes included in the vaccine. Let the three haplotypes be $H_{1}$, $H_{2}$, and $H_{3}$ with respective allele frequencies $f_{1} = 0.52$, $f_{2} = 0.33$, and $f_{3} = 0.15$. The total frequency is $f_{1} + f_{2} + f_{3} = 0.52 + 0.33 + 0.15 = 1.00$.\n\nThe expected strain coverage, denoted as $C(V)$, is the sum of the probabilities of protection for each possible infecting haplotype, weighted by their frequencies:\n$$C(V) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} f_{i} \\cdot P(\\text{protection} | \\text{infection with } H_{i}, \\text{vaccine } V)$$\n\nThe probability of protection depends on whether the infecting haplotype $H_i$ is included in the vaccine set $V$:\n1.  If $H_i \\in V$ (matched case), the protection probability is the allele-specific efficacy, $e = 0.85$.\n2.  If $H_i \\notin V$ (non-matched case), the protection is due to cross-protection from the $k = |V|$ components in the vaccine. Under the assumption of independence, this probability is $P_{cross} = 1 - (1 - c)^{k}$, where $c = 0.20$ is the cross-protection probability per component.\n\nWe can write a general formula for the coverage $C(V)$ with $k = |V|$ components:\n$$C(V) = \\sum_{H_i \\in V} f_i \\cdot e + \\sum_{H_j \\notin V} f_j \\cdot (1 - (1 - c)^{k})$$\n\nFirst, we must identify the optimal bivalent vaccine. A bivalent vaccine includes $k=2$ components. There are $\\binom{3}{2}=3$ possible bivalent vaccines: $V_{12} = \\{H_1, H_2\\}$, $V_{13} = \\{H_1, H_3\\}$, and $V_{23} = \\{H_2, H_3\\}$.\nFor any bivalent vaccine ($k=2$), the cross-protection probability against a non-matched haplotype is:\n$$P_{cross, 2} = 1 - (1 - c)^{2} = 1 - (1 - 0.20)^{2} = 1 - (0.80)^{2} = 1 - 0.64 = 0.36$$\n\nNow, we calculate the expected coverage for each bivalent vaccine:\n\n1.

Vaccine $V_{13} = \\{H_1, H_3\\}$: The included haplotypes are $H_1, H_3$. The non-included haplotype is $H_2$.\n    $$C(V_{13}) = (f_1 + f_3)e + f_2 P_{cross, 2}$$\n    $$C(V_{13}) = (0.52 + 0.15) \\cdot 0.85 + 0.33 \\cdot 0.36$$\n    $$C(V_{13}) = 0.67 \\cdot 0.85 + 0.1188 = 0.5695 + 0.1188 = 0.6883$$\n\n3.

The non-included haplotype is $H_1$.\n    $$C(V_{23}) = (f_2 + f_3)e + f_1 P_{cross, 2}$$\n    $$C(V_{23}) = (0.33 + 0.15) \\cdot 0.85 + 0.52 \\cdot 0.36$$\n    $$C(V_{23}) = 0.48 \\cdot 0.85 + 0.1872 = 0.4080 + 0.1872 = 0.5952$$\n\nComparing the coverages, $0.7765 > 0.6883 > 0.5952$. The optimal bivalent vaccine is $V_{12}$, which includes the two most frequent haplotypes. The maximum expected strain coverage for a bivalent vaccine is:\n$$C_{opt\\_bivalent} = C(V_{12}) = 0.7765$$\n\nNext, we calculate the expected coverage for the trivalent vaccine, $V_{trivalent} = \\{H_1, H_2, H_3\\}$.\nFor this vaccine, $k=3$. For any infection with haplotype $H_i$ (where $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$), the haplotype is always included in the vaccine ($H_i \\in V_{trivalent}$). Therefore, the protection probability is always the matched efficacy, $e$.\n$$C_{trivalent} = f_1 \\cdot e + f_2 \\cdot e + f_3 \\cdot e = (f_1 + f_2 + f_3) \\cdot e$$\nSince $f_1 + f_2 + f_3 = 1$, the coverage simplifies to:\n$$C_{trivalent} = 1 \\cdot e = e = 0.85$$\n\nFinally, we compute the marginal increase in expected strain coverage, which is the difference between the trivalent coverage and the optimal bivalent coverage.\n$$\\Delta C = C_{trivalent} - C_{opt\\_bivalent}$$\n$$\\Delta C = 0.85 - 0.7765 = 0.0735$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer rounded to four significant figures.

The basic reproduction number (denoted $R_{0}$) is defined as the expected number of secondary infections caused by a single typical infectious host introduced into a wholly susceptible population. The effective reproduction number (denoted $R_{\\text{eff}}$) is defined as the expected number of secondary infections caused by a single typical infectious host in the actual population under the specified intervention. The vaccine under study is leaky: for vaccinated individuals, it reduces their contribution to onward transmission by a proportion equal to the vaccine efficacy, denoted $e$, uniformly and independently across transmission events.

The task is to derive an expression for the effective reproduction number, $R_{\\text{eff}}$, and compute its numerical value based on the provided parameters.\n\n**1. Derivation of the expression for $R_{\\text{eff}}$**\n\nThe basic reproduction number, $R_0$, represents the expected number of secondary infections from a single infectious individual in a completely susceptible population. The effective reproduction number, $R_{\\text{eff}}$, is the corresponding quantity in the actual population, which includes the effects of an intervention, in this case, vaccination.\n\nThe problem states that a fraction $c$ of the host population is vaccinated. We are considering the number of secondary infections caused by a \"single typical infectious host.\" Under the assumption of homogeneous mixing, and given that the vaccine is described as reducing onward transmission rather than preventing infection, a typical infectious host is a randomly selected member of the population who has become infectious. Therefore, this typical host is:\n- Unvaccinated with probability $1-c$.\n- Vaccinated with probability $c$.\n\nLet us analyze the transmission potential of each type of host. We consider an environment that is, at the outset, entirely susceptible, so the baseline for transmission is set by $R_0$.\n\nAn **unvaccinated infectious host** will, by definition, cause a number of secondary infections equal to $R_0$ on average.\nContribution from unvaccinated host $= R_0$.\n\nA **vaccinated infectious host** has their contribution to onward transmission reduced by a proportion equal to the vaccine efficacy, $e$. This means their transmission potential is a fraction $(1-e)$ of the baseline.\nContribution from vaccinated host $= R_0 (1-e)$.\n\nThe effective reproduction number, $R_{\\text{eff}}$, is the expected value of the number of secondary infections caused by a typical infectious host. This is the weighted average of the contributions from the two types of hosts, weighted by their respective probabilities in the population.\n\n$$\nR_{\\text{eff}} = (\\text{Prob. host is unvaccinated}) \\times (\\text{Contribution from unvaccinated host}) + (\\text{Prob. host is vaccinated}) \\times (\\text{Contribution from vaccinated host})\n$$\n\nSubstituting the probabilities and contributions:\n$$\nR_{\\text{eff}} = (1-c) \\cdot R_0 + c \\cdot [R_0(1-e)]\n$$\n\nWe can factor out $R_0$ from the expression:\n$$\nR_{\\text{eff}} = R_0 [ (1-c) + c(1-e) ]\n$$\n\nSimplifying the term inside the brackets:\n$$\nR_{\\text{eff}} = R_0 [ 1 - c + c - ce ]\n$$\n$$\nR_{\\text{eff}} = R_0 (1 - ce)\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for $R_{\\text{eff}}$ in terms of $R_0$, $c$, and $e$. The term $ce$ represents the total effective reduction in population-level transmission due to the vaccination program.\n\n**2. Numerical Computation of $R_{\\text{eff}}$**\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Basic reproduction number, $R_0 = 3$.\n- Vaccine efficacy, $e = 0.6$.\n- Vaccination coverage, $c = 0.7$.\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived formula:\n$$\nR_{\\text{eff}} = 3 \\times (1 - 0.7 \\times 0.6)\n$$\n\nFirst, we compute the product $ce$:\n$$\nce = 0.7 \\times 0.6 = 0.42\n$$\n\nNow substitute this back into the expression for $R_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$\nR_{\\text{eff}} = 3 \\times (1 - 0.42)\n$$\n$$\nR_{\\text{eff}} = 3 \\times (0.58)\n$$\n$$\nR_{\\text{eff}} = 1.74\n$$\n\nThe result $1.74$ has three significant figures, so no further rounding is required.\n\n**3. Qualitative Assessment of Transmission Interruption**\n\nThe threshold criterion for interrupting disease transmission is that the effective reproduction number must be less than one, i.e., $R_{\\text{eff}} < 1$. If each infectious individual produces, on average, less than one new infection, the prevalence of the disease will decline and transmission will eventually cease.\n\nIn this case, we calculated $R_{\\text{eff}} = 1.74$. Since $1.74 > 1$, the intervention is insufficient to interrupt transmission. The disease will continue to spread in the population, although at a reduced rate compared to an unvaccinated population (where the reproduction number would be $3$).
