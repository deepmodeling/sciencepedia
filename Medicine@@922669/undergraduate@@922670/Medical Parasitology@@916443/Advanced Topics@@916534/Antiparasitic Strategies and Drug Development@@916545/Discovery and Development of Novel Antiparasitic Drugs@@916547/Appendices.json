It is scientifically grounded in the principles of biostatistics and high-throughput screening (HTS) assay validation. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data ($\\mu_n, s_n^2, \\mu_p, s_p^2$) to calculate the requested metric, the Z-prime factor. The terminology, while using $\\mu$ to denote a sample mean rather than the more rigorous $\\bar{x}$, is standard practice in the relevant biological literature and its meaning is unambiguous in this context. The problem is therefore solvable.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the Z-prime factor ($Z'$-factor), a statistical parameter used to assess the quality of an HTS assay. It quantifies the separation between the distributions of the positive and negative controls. The formula for the $Z'$-factor is:\n$$ Z' = 1 - \\frac{3(\\sigma_p + \\sigma_n)}{|\\mu_p - \\mu_n|} $$\nwhere $\\mu_n$ and $\\sigma_n$ are the mean and standard deviation of the negative controls, and $\\mu_p$ and $\\sigma_p$ are the mean and standard deviation of the positive controls.

The sample standard deviation is the square root of the sample variance. The problem notes that the provided sample variances include the Bessel correction ($n-1$ denominator), which is appropriate.\n\nThe standard deviation for the negative controls is:\n$$ s_n = \\sqrt{s_n^2} = \\sqrt{38.44} = 6.2 $$\nThe standard deviation for the positive controls is:\n$$ s_p = \\sqrt{s_p^2} = \\sqrt{19.36} = 4.4 $$\n\nNow, these values can be substituted into the $Z'$-factor formula.

It is a well-posed problem in quantitative pharmacology, grounded in established scientific principles, and provides all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of drug interaction based on the **Loewe additivity** principle at a fixed effect level ($50\\%$ inhibition). This principle serves as the definition for non-interaction.\n\nThe core idea of Loewe additivity is that a drug can be considered a dilution of itself. When two drugs, A and B, are combined, they are considered additive if they behave as if they are dilutions of one another. To formalize this, we consider the concentrations that produce a specific effect, in this case, $50\\%$ growth inhibition (the $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$).\n\nLet $D_A$ and $D_B$ be the concentrations of drug A and drug B, respectively, that individually produce the $50\\%$ inhibitory effect. The problem provides these values as:\n$D_A = 20\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$D_B = 100\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n\nNow, consider a combination of the two drugs with concentrations $d_A$ and $d_B$ that also produces the same $50\\%$ effect. The contribution of drug A to the total effect can be expressed as a fraction of the dose that would be required if drug A were acting alone. This is the Fractional Inhibitory Concentration (FIC) of drug A:\n$$ \\mathrm{FIC}_A = \\frac{d_A}{D_A} $$\nSimilarly, for drug B:\n$$ \\mathrm{FIC}_B = \\frac{d_B}{D_B} $$\n\nAccording to the Loewe additivity principle, if the two drugs are simply additive (i.e., non-interacting), the sum of their fractional contributions must equal $1$ to achieve the total desired effect. This sum is known as the Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index (FICI):\n$$ \\mathrm{FICI} = \\mathrm{FIC}_A + \\mathrm{FIC}_B = \\frac{d_A}{D_A} + \\frac{d_B}{D_B} $$\nFor a purely additive interaction, $\\mathrm{FICI} = 1$.\n\n### Isobologram Construction and Interpretation\n\nAn isobologram is a graphical representation of this principle. For a two-drug combination at a fixed effect level:\n1.  The concentration of drug A, $d_A$, is plotted on the x-axis.\n2.  The concentration of drug B, $d_B$, is plotted on the y-axis.\n3.  The point $(D_A, 0)$ represents the concentration of drug A alone needed for the effect. In this case, $(20\\,\\mathrm{nM}, 0)$.\n4.  The point $(0, D_B)$ represents the concentration of drug B alone needed for the effect. In this case, $(0, 100\\,\\mathrm{nM})$.\n5.  The equation for additivity, $\\frac{d_A}{D_A} + \\frac{d_B}{D_B} = 1$, describes a straight line connecting these two intercepts. This is the **line of additivity**, or the isobole for additivity.\n\nAny experimentally determined dose pair $(d_A, d_B)$ that produces the $50\\%$ effect can be plotted on this graph and its interaction classified based on its position relative to the line of additivity:\n-   **On the line ($\\mathrm{FICI} = 1$)**: The combination is **additive**. The effect is what is expected from the sum of the actions of the two drugs.\n-   **Below the line ($\\mathrm{FICI} < 1$)**: The combination is **synergistic**. Less drug is required in combination than predicted by additivity, meaning the drugs potentiate each other.\n-   **Above the line ($\\mathrm{FICI} > 1$)**: The combination is **antagonistic**. More drug is required in combination than predicted, meaning the drugs interfere with each other's effects.\n\n### Analysis of the Given Dose Pairs\n\nWe calculate the FICI for each of the three experimental dose pairs which all result in $50\\%$ inhibition.\n-   $D_A = 20\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n-   $D_B = 100\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n\n**Pair 1:** $(d_A, d_B) = (10\\,\\mathrm{nM}, 50\\,\\mathrm{nM})$\n$$ \\mathrm{FICI}_1 = \\frac{10}{20} + \\frac{50}{100} = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0 $$\nSince $\\mathrm{FICI}_1 = 1$, this combination is **additive**.\n\n**Pair 2:** $(d_A, d_B) = (5\\,\\mathrm{nM}, 30\\,\\mathrm{nM})$\n$$ \\mathrm{FICI}_2 = \\frac{5}{20} + \\frac{30}{100} = 0.25 + 0.30 = 0.55 $$\nSince $\\mathrm{FICI}_2 < 1$, this combination is **synergistic**.\n\n**Pair 3:** $(d_A, d_B) = (12\\,\\mathrm{nM}, 80\\,\\mathrm{nM})$\n$$ \\mathrm{FICI}_3 = \\frac{12}{20} + \\frac{80}{100} = 0.6 + 0.8 = 1.4 $$\nSince $\\mathrm{FICI}_3 > 1$, this combination is **antagonistic**.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Under Loewe additivity at $50\\%$ effect, plot $d_A$ on the $x$-axis and $d_B$ on the $y$-axis. The line of additivity is the straight line connecting the intercepts $(D_A, 0)$ and $(0, D_B)$. Dose pairs that satisfy $(d_A / D_A) + (d_B / D_B) = 1$ lie on the line (additive), those with $(d_A / D_A) + (d_B / D_B) < 1$ lie below the line (synergy), and those with $(d_A / D_A) + (d_B / D_B) > 1$ lie above the line (antagonism). For the three dose pairs: $(10, 50)$ is additive, $(5, 30)$ is synergistic, and $(12, 80)$ is antagonistic.**\nThis option correctly describes the construction of the isobologram, the mathematical definition of the line of additivity, and the criteria for synergy, additivity, and antagonism based on first principles of Loewe additivity. Its classification of the three dose pairs exactly matches our calculations: $(10, 50)$ is additive ($\\mathrm{FICI}=1.0$), $(5, 30)$ is synergistic ($\\mathrm{FICI}=0.55$), and $(12, 80)$ is antagonistic ($\\mathrm{FICI}=1.4$).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Using Bliss independence for noninteraction at $50\\%$ effect, the additivity boundary in dose–dose space is curved; points below this boundary indicate antagonism and points above indicate synergy. For the three dose pairs, $(10, 50)$ is antagonistic because it uses more total drug than expected under independence.**\nThis option is incorrect for multiple reasons. First, it invokes Bliss independence, which is a different model of noninteraction and contradicts the problem's explicit instruction to use Loewe additivity. Second, the interpretation of points above/below the boundary for Bliss independence is often the reverse of what is stated.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The isobologram should plot fractional effects on both axes, and the line of additivity runs from $(0, 0)$ to $(1, 1)$. Because each combination achieves $50\\%$ inhibition, all three points lie on the line and are additive.**\nThis description is a fundamental misunderstanding of an isobologram. An isobologram plots concentrations ($d_A$ vs. $d_B$) for a *fixed* effect level, not fractional effects on the axes. The reasoning that all points must be additive because they achieve the same effect is fallacious; the very purpose of the analysis is to determine if the experimental curve of constant effect (the isobole) deviates from the theoretical line of additivity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The correct additivity condition is $d_A D_A + d_B D_B = D_A D_B$. With the given data, each combination satisfies $d_A D_A + d_B D_B < D_A D_B$, so all three are synergistic.**\nThe proposed additivity condition is mathematically incorrect. Multiplying the correct relation, $\\frac{d_A}{D_A} + \\frac{d_B}{D_B} = 1$, by $D_A D_B$ yields $d_A D_B + d_B D_A = D_A D_B$. The formula in the option is dimensionally inconsistent and algebraically incorrect. Furthermore, applying the incorrect formula to the data leads to a false conclusion. For pair 1: $(10)(20) + (50)(100) = 5200$, while $(20)(100) = 2000$. The condition $5200 < 2000$ is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Define the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) for each drug as $\\mathrm{FIC}_i = d_i / D_i$ and the FIC index (FICI) as $\\mathrm{FICI} = \\mathrm{FIC}_A + \\mathrm{FIC}_B$. Classify synergy if $\\mathrm{FICI} < 0.5$, additivity if $0.5 \\le \\mathrm{FICI} \\le 1$, and antagonism if $\\mathrm{FICI} > 1$. For the three dose pairs, $\\mathrm{FICI} = 1.0$, $0.55$, and $1.4$, respectively, so only $(5, 30)$ is synergistic.**\nThis option correctly defines FICI and calculates the values accurately. However, it introduces a specific set of practical classification cutoffs ($\\mathrm{FICI} < 0.5$ for synergy) that are not derived from first principles. More importantly, it then contradicts its own rule. The FICI for $(5, 30)$ is $0.55$. According to the stated rule, this would be classified as \"additivity\" since $0.5 \\le 0.55 \\le 1$. The option's conclusion that this point is \"synergistic\" is false under its own premise. The option is internally inconsistent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4786029"}]}
