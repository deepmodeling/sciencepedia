In evaluating progression criteria for antiparasitic chemotherapy, two quantitative measures are central: the selectivity index and a minimal margin requirement that accounts for pharmacodynamic and translational factors.\n\nUse the following foundational definitions and well-tested relationships:\n\n- The selectivity index is defined as $S = \\mathrm{CC}_{50}/\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$.\n- The pharmacodynamic response of effect $E$ versus concentration $C$ can be modeled by the Hill function $E(C) = E_{\\max}\\,\\dfrac{C^{n}}{C^{n} + \\mathrm{EC}_{50}^{n}}$, where $n$ is the Hill coefficient and $E_{\\max}$ is the maximal effect.\n- To ensure translational robustness when moving from in vitro to in vivo, progression requires achieving $90\\%$ of maximal antiparasitic effect (i.e., target $\\mathrm{EC}_{90}$ rather than $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$), covering inter-assay potency variability by a multiplicative factor $v$, accounting for plasma protein binding via the unbound fraction $f_{u}$ (only unbound drug is pharmacologically active), and reserving a safety buffer factor $b$ to reduce the risk of off-target host toxicity.\n\nAssume $n = 1$, $v = 3$, $f_{u} = 0.10$, and $b = 10$.

We can therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part calculation: first, the observed selectivity index, $S$, for the candidate compound, and second, the minimum required selectivity index for progression, $S_{\\mathrm{req}}$, based on a set of translational criteria.\n\nFirst, we compute the selectivity index, $S$, defined as the ratio of the half maximal cytotoxic concentration ($\\mathrm{CC}_{50}$) to the half maximal effective concentration ($\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$).\nThe given values are $\\mathrm{CC}_{50} = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $\\mathrm{EC}_{50} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.

This derivation incorporates several translational factors into the simple selectivity index definition.\n\nThe first step is to determine the concentration required to achieve $90\\%$ of the maximal effect, denoted as $\\mathrm{EC}_{90}$. We use the provided Hill function:\n$$ E(C) = E_{\\max}\\,\\frac{C^{n}}{C^{n} + \\mathrm{EC}_{50}^{n}} $$\nBy definition, at $C = \\mathrm{EC}_{90}$, the effect $E$ is $0.90 \\times E_{\\max}$.\n$$ 0.90 \\times E_{\\max} = E_{\\max}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{EC}_{90}^{n}}{\\mathrm{EC}_{90}^{n} + \\mathrm{EC}_{50}^{n}} $$\nDividing by $E_{\\max}$ and rearranging the equation:\n$$ 0.90 (\\mathrm{EC}_{90}^{n} + \\mathrm{EC}_{50}^{n}) = \\mathrm{EC}_{90}^{n} $$\n$$ 0.90 \\mathrm{EC}_{90}^{n} + 0.90 \\mathrm{EC}_{50}^{n} = \\mathrm{EC}_{90}^{n} $$\n$$ 0.90 \\mathrm{EC}_{50}^{n} = \\mathrm{EC}_{90}^{n} - 0.90 \\mathrm{EC}_{90}^{n} = 0.10 \\mathrm{EC}_{90}^{n} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{EC}_{90}^{n} = \\frac{0.90}{0.10} \\mathrm{EC}_{50}^{n} = 9 \\mathrm{EC}_{50}^{n} $$\nTaking the $n$-th root of both sides gives the relationship between $\\mathrm{EC}_{90}$ and $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{EC}_{90} = 9^{1/n} \\mathrm{EC}_{50} $$\nFor the given Hill coefficient $n=1$, this simplifies to $\\mathrm{EC}_{90} = 9 \\mathrm{EC}_{50}$.\n\nNow, we construct the progression criterion. The criterion requires that the therapeutically necessary drug concentration is safely below the toxic concentration.\nThe required total plasma concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{required}}$, must be high enough to achieve an unbound concentration equal to $\\mathrm{EC}_{90}$, accounting for plasma protein binding (via the unbound fraction $f_u$) and inter-assay variability ($v$). The unbound concentration is the total concentration multiplied by $f_u$. Therefore, to achieve an unbound concentration of $\\mathrm{EC}_{90}$, the total concentration must be $\\mathrm{EC}_{90}/f_u$. The variability factor $v$ is a multiplier to ensure robustness against less favorable potency measurements.\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{required}} = v \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{EC}_{90}}{f_u} $$\nThe maximum tolerable total plasma concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{tolerable}}$, is determined by the in vitro cytotoxicity, $\\mathrm{CC}_{50}$, adjusted by a safety buffer factor $b$.\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{tolerable}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{CC}_{50}}{b} $$\nFor a drug candidate to progress, the required therapeutic concentration must not exceed the maximum tolerable concentration:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{required}} \\le C_{\\mathrm{tolerable}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $C_{\\mathrm{required}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{tolerable}}$:\n$$ v \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{EC}_{90}}{f_u} \\le \\frac{\\mathrm{CC}_{50}}{b} $$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $\\mathrm{EC}_{90}$:\n$$ v \\cdot \\frac{9^{1/n} \\mathrm{EC}_{50}}{f_u} \\le \\frac{\\mathrm{CC}_{50}}{b} $$\nTo find the required selectivity index, we rearrange the inequality to isolate the ratio $\\mathrm{CC}_{50}/\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$, which is the selectivity index $S$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{CC}_{50}}{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}} \\ge \\frac{v \\cdot b \\cdot 9^{1/n}}{f_u} $$\nThe expression on the right-hand side represents the minimum required selectivity index, $S_{\\mathrm{req}}$.\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{req}} = \\frac{v \\cdot b \\cdot 9^{1/n}}{f_u} $$\nThis is the required closed-form expression.\n\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value of $S_{\\mathrm{req}}$ using the provided parameters: $n=1$, $v=3$, $f_u=0.10$, and $b=10$.\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{req}} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9^{1/1}}{0.10} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9}{0.10} = \\frac{270}{0.10} = 2700 $$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $S_{\\mathrm{req}} = 2.70 \\times 10^3$.\n\nThe calculated selectivity index for the compound is $S = 1.00 \\times 10^3$ ($1000$), while the required minimum selectivity index for progression is $S_{\\mathrm{req}} = 2.70 \\times 10^3$ ($2700$).

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part answer: first, a calculation of the probability of resistance establishment, and second, a justification for the properties of a partner drug in combination therapy.\n\nPart 1: Calculating the probability of resistance establishment.\n\nThe first step is to determine the total number of parasite genome replications that occur under drug pressure. This represents the number of independent trials for a resistance-conferring mutation to occur.\nGiven an initial parasite burden $N_{0} = 1.0 \\times 10^{11}$ and a fraction $f = 0.005$ of these parasites successfully initiating replication, the number of replication attempts, $N_{\\mathrm{rep}}$, is:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{rep}} = f N_{0} = (0.005) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{11}) = 5.0 \\times 10^{8}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the probability that a single replication event leads to an *established* resistant lineage. This is a compound event requiring two sequential and independent steps:\n1.  A specific point mutation ($\\mathrm{Y268S}$) must occur during replication. The probability of this is given by the mutation rate, $\\mu = 3.0 \\times 10^{-8}$.\n2.  The newly formed mutant parasite must survive stochastic extinction and establish a persistent lineage. The probability of this is the establishment probability, $p_{\\mathrm{est}} = 0.12$.\n\nThe overall probability of success for a single replication attempt, let's call it $p_{\\mathrm{event}}$, is the product of these two probabilities:\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{event}} = \\mu \\times p_{\\mathrm{est}} = (3.0 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times (0.12) = 3.6 \\times 10^{-9}\n$$\nThis is the probability that one specific replication attempt produces a mutant that goes on to found a successful resistant population.\n\nNow, we have $N_{\\mathrm{rep}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{8}$ independent trials (replication events), each with a very small probability of success $p_{\\mathrm{event}} = 3.6 \\times 10^{-9}$. The number of established resistant lineages, let's denote it by the random variable $X$, follows a binomial distribution, $X \\sim B(N_{\\mathrm{rep}}, p_{\\mathrm{event}})$.\nSince $N_{\\mathrm{rep}}$ is very large and $p_{\\mathrm{event}}$ is very small, this binomial distribution can be accurately approximated by a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda$, where $\\lambda$ is the expected number of successful events.\n$$\n\\lambda = E[X] = N_{\\mathrm{rep}} \\times p_{\\mathrm{event}} = (5.0 \\times 10^{8}) \\times (3.6 \\times 10^{-9}) = 1.8\n$$\nThe probability of observing $k$ established lineages is given by the Poisson probability mass function:\n$$\nP(X=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!} = \\frac{(1.8)^k \\exp(-1.8)}{k!}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the probability that *at least one* resistant lineage establishes, which is $P(X \\ge 1)$. It is more direct to calculate the probability of the complementary event, i.e., that *zero* resistant lineages establish, $P(X=0)$, and subtract it from $1$.\n$$\nP(X=0) = \\frac{(1.8)^0 \\exp(-1.8)}{0!} = \\frac{1 \\times \\exp(-1.8)}{1} = \\exp(-1.8)\n$$\nTherefore, the probability of at least one resistant lineage establishing is:\n$$\nP(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X=0) = 1 - \\exp(-1.8)\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\nP(X \\ge 1) \\approx 1 - 0.1652988... = 0.8347011...\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the probability is $0.835$.\n\nPart 2: Justification for partner drug properties.\n\nThe calculation above demonstrates a high probability ($83.5\\%$) of treatment failure due to the de novo emergence of resistance when atovaquone is used as monotherapy against a high parasite burden. To mitigate this risk, a partner drug should be added, forming a combination therapy. The ideal properties of this partner drug are based on the principle of making the simultaneous acquisition of resistance to both drugs an exceedingly rare event.\n\n1.  **Different Mechanism of Action (MOA) and Target:** The partner drug must act on a different molecular target than atovaquone (the cytochrome $b$c1 complex). This ensures that a single mutation, like $\\mathrm{Y268S}$, cannot confer resistance to both drugs.\n\n2.  **No Cross-Resistance:** The genetic determinants of resistance to the partner drug must be different from those for atovaquone. If a parasite acquires the $\\mathrm{Y268S}$ mutation, it remains fully susceptible to the partner drug. The probability of a single parasite developing resistance to both drugs requires (at least) two independent mutation events. The probability of this occurring in a single replication is the product of the individual mutation rates, e.g., $\\mu_1 \\times \\mu_2 \\approx (10^{-8}) \\times (10^{-8}) = 10^{-16}$. Such a low probability makes the emergence of a dually-resistant mutant within a single host virtually impossible.\n\n3.  **Similar Pharmacokinetic (PK) Profiles:** To prevent a period of \"functional monotherapy,\" both drugs should maintain therapeutic concentrations for a similar duration. If one drug is cleared from the body much faster than the other, the remaining drug will be exposed to the parasite population alone, creating a selective window for resistance to emerge against that single agent, thereby undermining the primary advantage of the combination.
