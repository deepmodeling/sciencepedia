We will proceed to derive the analytical expressions for Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) and then compute their numerical values.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has the disease (malaria) and $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have the disease. Let $T$ be the event that the test result is positive and $T^c$ be the event that the test result is negative.\n\nThe given definitions can be expressed in terms of conditional probabilities:\n-   Prevalence ($\\pi$): $P(D) = \\pi$. Consequently, the probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - \\pi$.\n-   Sensitivity ($Se$): $P(T|D) = Se$. This is the probability of a true positive.

The probability of a false positive is thus $P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - Sp$.\n\nOur goal is to derive expressions for PPV and NPV.\n-   Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is the probability of having the disease given a positive test result: $PPV = P(D|T)$.\n-   Negative Predictive Value (NPV) is the probability of not having the disease given a negative test result: $NPV = P(D^c|T^c)$.\n\nWe will use Bayes' theorem, which states that for events $A$ and $B$, $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$.\n\n**Derivation of Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\n\nApplying Bayes' theorem to find $PPV = P(D|T)$:\n$$PPV = P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result.

As prevalence $\\pi$ increases, the numerator ($Se \\cdot \\pi$) increases, and the contribution of true positives ($Se \\cdot \\pi$) dominates the contribution of false positives ($(1-Sp)(1-\\pi)$) in the denominator. This means that in high-prevalence settings, a positive test result is highly likely to be a true positive, making the test very useful for \"ruling in\" the diagnosis of malaria. Conversely, as $\\pi$ decreases towards $0$, the $PPV$ also approaches $0$. In a low-prevalence setting, a large proportion of positive results will be false positives, severely limiting the test's utility for confirming the disease.\n\n-   **NPV and Ruling Out Disease:** The expression $NPV = \\frac{Sp \\cdot (1-\\pi)}{(1-Se)\\cdot \\pi + Sp \\cdot (1-\\pi)}$ shows that $NPV$ is a decreasing function of $\\pi$. As prevalence $\\pi$ decreases, the term $(1-\\pi)$ approaches $1$, and the term $(1-Se)\\cdot\\pi$ in the denominator approaches $0$. This makes the $NPV$ approach $1$. A very high $NPV$ means that a negative test result is extremely likely to be a true negative. Therefore, in low-prevalence settings, the test is exceptionally powerful for \"ruling out\" malaria, assuring the clinician that the patient is very likely disease-free. As prevalence $\\pi$ increases, the probability of false negatives ($(1-Se)\\cdot\\pi$) increases relative to true negatives ($Sp \\cdot(1-\\pi)$), causing the $NPV$ to decrease, thus slightly weakening its ability to definitively rule out the disease.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.8407  0.9944 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4778776"}, {"introduction": "Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) is a cornerstone of modern molecular diagnostics, allowing us to not only detect but also quantify pathogen DNA.

For a given assay run, the standard curve has slope $m=-3.5$ and intercept $b=38$. A patient sample yields $C_t=30$.

This relationship can be expressed as a linear equation:\n$$C_t = m \\cdot \\log_{10}(N_0) + b$$\nwhere $m$ is the slope of the standard curve and $b$ is the y-intercept.\n\nTo derive an expression for $N_0$ in terms of $C_t$, $m$, and $b$, we must algebraically rearrange this equation.\nFirst, subtract the intercept $b$ from both sides of the equation:\n$$C_t - b = m \\cdot \\log_{10}(N_0)$$\nNext, divide both sides by the slope $m$ to isolate the logarithmic term:\n$$\\frac{C_t - b}{m} = \\log_{10}(N_0)$$\nFinally, to solve for $N_0$, we apply the definition of the base-$10$ logarithm. The equation $\\log_{10}(x) = y$ is equivalent to $x = 10^y$. Applying this property, we obtain the expression for $N_0$:\n$$N_0 = 10^{\\left(\\frac{C_t - b}{m}\\right)}$$\nThis is the general expression for the starting copy number based on the parameters of a qPCR standard curve.\n\nNow, we can compute the value of $N_0$ for the patient sample using the provided data:\nThe measured threshold cycle is $C_t = 30$.\nThe slope of the standard curve is $m = -3.5$.\nThe y-intercept of the standard curve is $b = 38$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$N_0 = 10^{\\left(\\frac{30 - 38}{-3.5}\\right)}$$\nFirst, we evaluate the exponent:\n$$\\frac{30 - 38}{-3.5} = \\frac{-8}{-3.5} = \\frac{8}{3.5} = \\frac{8}{7/2} = \\frac{16}{7}$$\nSo the expression for $N_0$ becomes:\n$$N_0 = 10^{16/7}$$\nNumerically evaluating this expression:\n$$N_0 \\approx 10^{2.285714...} \\approx 193.06977$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$N_0 \\approx 193$$\nTherefore, the starting copy number of the target sequence in the reaction is approximately $193$ copies.\n\nFinally, we are asked to comment on whether this value is biologically plausible for a low-parasitemia infection. The calculated value is $N_0 \\approx 193$ target copies per reaction. This quantity was present in the $5$ µL of template DNA added to the total reaction volume of $20$ µL.\n\nThe target is specified as a multicopy locus within the *Plasmodium falciparum* genome. A common example is the $18$S ribosomal RNA gene, of which there are approximately $5$ to $8$ copies per haploid parasite genome. Let us assume an average of $c \\approx 5$ copies of the target per parasite.\nThe number of parasite genomes in the reaction can be estimated as:\n$$\\text{Number of parasites} = \\frac{N_0}{c} \\approx \\frac{193}{5} \\approx 38.6 \\text{ parasites}$$\nThis number of parasites was contained in the $5$ µL of template DNA. This corresponds to a template concentration of approximately $38.6 / 5 = 7.72$ parasite genomes per microliter of DNA extract.\n\nTo relate this back to parasitemia in blood, we must consider the DNA extraction process, for which details are not provided. A typical protocol might involve extracting DNA from $V_{\\text{blood}} = 200$ µL of whole blood and eluting it into a final volume of $V_{\\text{eluate}} = 50$ to $100$ µL. Assuming an elution volume of $V_{\\text{eluate}} = 100$ µL and a hypothetical $100\\%$ recovery efficiency, the total number of parasites in the original blood sample would be $(7.72 \\text{ parasites/µL}) \\times (100 \\text{ µL}) = 772$ parasites. The parasitemia would then be $\\frac{772 \\text{ parasites}}{200 \\text{ µL of blood}} \\approx 3.9$ parasites/µL.\n\nClinical thresholds for low parasitemia are typically considered to be below $100$ parasites/µL, and submicroscopic infections (those generally missed by light microscopy) can have levels below $1$ parasite/µL. An estimated parasitemia of approximately $4$ parasites/µL falls squarely within the range of a low-level infection that molecular methods like qPCR are designed to detect. The use of a multicopy target enhances the sensitivity of the assay, making the detection of such low parasite burdens feasible. Therefore, the computed copy number $N_0 \\approx 193$ is entirely plausible in the context of diagnosing a low-parasitemia *P. falciparum* infection.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{193}$$", "id": "4778763"}, {"introduction": "The sensitivity of a molecular assay is not just a function of the qPCR machine itself, but of the entire workflow, from sample collection to the final reaction setup.
