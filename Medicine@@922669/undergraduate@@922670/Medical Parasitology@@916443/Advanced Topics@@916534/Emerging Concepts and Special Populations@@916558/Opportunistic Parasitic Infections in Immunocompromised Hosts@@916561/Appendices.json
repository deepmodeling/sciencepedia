At baseline, participants are stratified by absolute CD4 T-lymphocyte count into three categories that each represent a one-step decrement of approximately $50$ cells per $\\text{mm}^3$ over the range studied.

The inverse relationship between CD4 T-lymphocyte count and the risk of opportunistic infections, such as toxoplasmic encephalitis, in HIV-positive individuals is a fundamental principle of infectious disease pathogenesis. The data, while hypothetical, are plausible for an untreated cohort latent with *Toxoplasma gondii*. The use of cumulative incidence and relative risk are standard epidemiological measures. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data and a clear modeling assumption (constant multiplicative risk factor) required to compute a unique solution. The question is specific and the objective is clearly defined.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and objective language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n- **Consistency and Completeness**: The problem is self-contained. The data and the modeling assumption are sufficient for a solution. The problem explicitly requests a check of the internal consistency of the assumption with the data, which is a key part of the scientific method. There are no apparent contradictions.\n- **Other Flaws**: The problem does not violate any other criteria. It is not trivial, as it requires correct application of epidemiological definitions and verification of a model. It is a formalizable and relevant exercise in biostatistics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a well-constructed exercise in applying core epidemiological principles to a clinically relevant scenario. I will now proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe primary task is to calculate a single, constant relative risk ($RR$) for a $50$-cell/$\\text{mm}^3$ decrement in CD4 count, based on the provided cohort data. This requires first calculating the cumulative incidence in each stratum and then using the modeling assumption to determine the relative risk.\n\n**1. Definition and Calculation of Cumulative Incidence (CI)**\n\nCumulative incidence, or risk, is a measure of the proportion of a population at risk that develops a disease over a specified time period. It is defined as:\n$$CI = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases during a specified period}}{\\text{Number of individuals at risk at the start of the period}}$$\n\nUsing the provided data for the $12$-month follow-up period, we calculate the $CI$ for each stratum:\n\n- **Stratum 1 (CD4 $150$–$199$ cells/$\\text{mm}^3$)**:\nLet the risk be $CI_1$. With $20$ incident cases among $1000$ individuals at risk:\n$$CI_1 = \\frac{20}{1000} = 0.02$$\n\n- **Stratum 2 (CD4 $100$–$149$ cells/$\\text{mm}^3$)**:\nLet the risk be $CI_2$. With $36$ incident cases among $800$ individuals at risk:\n$$CI_2 = \\frac{36}{800} = \\frac{9}{200} = 0.045$$\n\n- **Stratum 3 (CD4 $50$–$99$ cells/$\\text{mm}^3$)**:\nLet the risk be $CI_3$. With $81$ incident cases among $800$ individuals at risk:\n$$CI_3 = \\frac{81}{800} = 0.10125$$\n\n**2. Scientific Reasonableness of the Modeling Assumption**\n\nThe problem posits that the risk increases by a constant multiplicative factor for each $50$-cell/$\\text{mm}^3$ decrement. This implies an exponential relationship between the CD4 count decrement and risk. This is a scientifically reasonable simplifying assumption in this context. The risk profile of many opportunistic infections does not increase linearly with the decline in CD4 count but rather accelerates as the immune system becomes more profoundly compromised. An exponential model, where risk is multiplied by a constant factor for each unit decrease in the protective variable (CD4 cells), captures this accelerating phenomenon more effectively than a simple additive model. This type of log-linear relationship is a common and often appropriate model for dose-response or exposure-outcome relationships in biology and epidemiology over a circumscribed range.\n\n**3. Application of the Model and Internal Consistency Check**\n\nLet $RR_{\\Delta 50}$ be the constant relative risk for a single-step $50$-cell/$\\text{mm}^3$ decrement. The strata represent such decrements. The model assumption implies:\n$$CI_2 = CI_1 \\times RR_{\\Delta 50}$$\n$$CI_3 = CI_2 \\times RR_{\\Delta 50}$$\n\nTo find the \"single...relative risk that is consistent with these data,\" we can compute the relative risk for each step-wise transition and check for consistency, as required by the prompt.\n\n- **Relative Risk from Stratum 1 to Stratum 2**:\nThe relative risk, $RR_{1 \\to 2}$, is the ratio of the risk in the lower CD4 stratum to the risk in the higher one.\n$$RR_{1 \\to 2} = \\frac{CI_2}{CI_1} = \\frac{0.045}{0.02} = 2.25$$\n\n- **Relative Risk from Stratum 2 to Stratum 3**:\nSimilarly, the relative risk, $RR_{2 \\to 3}$, is:\n$$RR_{2 \\to 3} = \\frac{CI_3}{CI_2} = \\frac{0.10125}{0.045}$$\nTo compute this fraction:\n$$RR_{2 \\to 3} = \\frac{0.10125}{0.045} = \\frac{101.25}{45} = \\frac{202.5}{90} = \\frac{405}{180} = \\frac{81}{36} = \\frac{9}{4} = 2.25$$\n\nThe calculations show that $RR_{1 \\to 2} = RR_{2 \\to 3} = 2.25$. The data are perfectly consistent with the assumption of a constant multiplicative factor. The problem was constructed such that a statistical estimation technique (like computing a geometric mean or performing regression) is unnecessary. The single consistent relative risk per $50$-cells per $\\text{mm}^3$ decrement is therefore exactly $2.25$.\n\n**4. Final Answer Formulation**\n\nThe computed relative risk is $2.25$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Since the value is exact, we express it with the required precision by appending a trailing zero.\n$$RR_{\\Delta 50} = 2.250$$\nThis value is dimensionless, as it is a ratio of two probabilities (risks).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.250}$$", "id": "4804358"}, {"introduction": "In practice, clinical diagnosis is a dynamic process of synthesizing multiple pieces of information, not relying on a single test.
