Let the alleles be $A$ and $a$, with allele $A$ providing partial protection against severe malaria when present in the heterozygous genotype but causing a fitness cost when homozygous due to red blood cell (RBC) pathology. Assume the following viability fitnesses after zygote formation but before reproduction: the homozygote $AA$ has relative fitness $1 - s_{1}$, the heterozygote $Aa$ has relative fitness $1$, and the homozygote $aa$ has relative fitness $1 - s_{2}$, where $0 < s_{1} < 1$ and $0 < s_{2} < 1$.

The model of heterozygote advantage is a cornerstone of population genetics and is well-established. The use of *Plasmodium falciparum* as the selective agent is a classic, factually correct example (e.g., the sickle-cell allele).\n- The problem is well-posed. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided, and the objective is clearly stated. The constraints on $s_1$ and $s_2$ ensure biological realism. A unique internal equilibrium is expected and exists under these conditions.\n- The language is objective and precise, with no ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n- The problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $p_t$ be the frequency of allele $A$ and $q_t = 1 - p_t$ be the frequency of allele $a$ in the population of zygotes at the start of generation $t$. Under the assumption of random mating, the genotype frequencies before selection are given by the Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium proportions:\n- Frequency of $AA$: $P_{AA} = p_t^2$\n- Frequency of $Aa$: $P_{Aa} = 2p_t q_t = 2p_t(1 - p_t)$\n- Frequency of $aa$: $P_{aa} = q_t^2 = (1 - p_t)^2$\n\nViability selection occurs before adulthood. The contribution of each genotype to the next generation is proportional to its initial frequency multiplied by its relative fitness. The relative frequencies after selection are:\n- Proportional frequency of $AA$ survivors: $p_t^2 w_{AA} = p_t^2(1 - s_1)$\n- Proportional frequency of $Aa$ survivors: $2p_t(1 - p_t)w_{Aa} = 2p_t(1 - p_t)$\n- Proportional frequency of $aa$ survivors: $(1 - p_t)^2 w_{aa} = (1 - p_t)^2(1 - s_2)$\n\nTo find the actual frequencies of the surviving adults, we must normalize by the mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}_t$. The mean fitness is the sum of the genotype frequencies weighted by their fitnesses:\n$$ \\bar{w}_t = p_t^2 w_{AA} + 2p_t(1 - p_t)w_{Aa} + (1 - p_t)^2 w_{aa} $$\n$$ \\bar{w}_t = p_t^2 (1 - s_1) + 2p_t(1 - p_t) + (1 - p_t)^2 (1 - s_2) $$\nExpanding this expression:\n$$ \\bar{w}_t = p_t^2 - s_1 p_t^2 + 2p_t - 2p_t^2 + (1 - 2p_t + p_t^2)(1 - s_2) $$\n$$ \\bar{w}_t = -p_t^2 + 2p_t - s_1 p_t^2 + 1 - 2p_t + p_t^2 - s_2(1 - p_t)^2 $$\n$$ \\bar{w}_t = 1 - s_1 p_t^2 - s_2(1 - p_t)^2 $$\n\nThe frequency of allele $A$ in the next generation, $p_{t+1}$, is the frequency of allele $A$ in the gene pool of the adult survivors who will contribute gametes to form the zygotes of generation $t+1$. This is calculated from the frequencies of the surviving genotypes:\n$$ p_{t+1} = \\frac{\\text{(Freq of } AA \\text{ after selection)} + \\frac{1}{2}(\\text{Freq of } Aa \\text{ after selection)}}{\\text{Sum of frequencies after selection}} $$\nThe denominator is $\\bar{w}_t / \\bar{w}_t = 1$. The frequencies of genotypes after selection are their proportional frequencies divided by $\\bar{w}_t$.\n$$ p_{t+1} = \\frac{p_t^2 (1 - s_1)}{\\bar{w}_t} + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2p_t(1 - p_t)}{\\bar{w}_t} $$\n$$ p_{t+1} = \\frac{p_t^2(1 - s_1) + p_t(1 - p_t)}{\\bar{w}_t} $$\nSimplifying the numerator:\n$$ p_t^2 - s_1 p_t^2 + p_t - p_t^2 = p_t - s_1 p_t^2 = p_t(1 - s_1 p_t) $$\nSubstituting the numerator and the expression for $\\bar{w}_t$, we obtain the allele-frequency recursion equation:\n$$ p_{t+1} = \\frac{p_t(1 - s_1 p_t)}{1 - s_1 p_t^2 - s_2(1 - p_t)^2} $$\nThis is the explicit algebraic expression for $p_{t+1}$ as a function of $p_t$, $s_1$, and $s_2$.\n\nNext, we compute the internal polymorphic equilibrium frequency, $p^*$. At equilibrium, the allele frequency does not change between generations, so $p_{t+1} = p_t = p^*$.\n$$ p^* = \\frac{p^*(1 - s_1 p^*)}{1 - s_1 (p^*)^2 - s_2(1 - p^*)^2} $$\nThis equation has trivial solutions at the boundaries of the frequency domain: $p^* = 0$ (fixation of allele $a$) and $p^* = 1$ (fixation of allele $A$). For the internal equilibrium, we assume $0 < p^* < 1$, which allows us to divide by $p^*$ (since $p^* \\neq 0$):\n$$ 1 = \\frac{1 - s_1 p^*}{1 - s_1 (p^*)^2 - s_2(1 - p^*)^2} $$\nThis implies that at the internal equilibrium, the mean fitness $\\bar{w}$ at $p^*$ is equal to the marginal fitness of the heterozygote carriers of allele $A$.\n$$ \\bar{w}_{p=p^*} = 1 - s_1 p^* $$\nSubstituting the full expression for $\\bar{w}$:\n$$ 1 - s_1 (p^*)^2 - s_2(1 - p^*)^2 = 1 - s_1 p^* $$\nWe can subtract $1$ from both sides:\n$$ -s_1 (p^*)^2 - s_2(1 - p^*)^2 = -s_1 p^* $$\nExpand the squared term:\n$$ -s_1 (p^*)^2 - s_2(1 - 2p^* + (p^*)^2) = -s_1 p^* $$\n$$ -s_1 (p^*)^2 - s_2 + 2s_2 p^* - s_2 (p^*)^2 = -s_1 p^* $$\nRearrange the equation to solve for $p^*$:\n$$ s_1 p^* - s_1 (p^*)^2 + 2s_2 p^* - s_2 (p^*)^2 - s_2 = 0 $$\nGroup terms by powers of $p^*$:\n$$ -(s_1 + s_2)(p^*)^2 + (s_1 + 2s_2)p^* - s_2 = 0 $$\n$$ (s_1 + s_2)(p^*)^2 - (s_1 + 2s_2)p^* + s_2 = 0 $$\nThis is a quadratic equation in $p^*$. As noted earlier, $p^* = 1$ is one root:\n$(s_1 + s_2)(1)^2 - (s_1 + 2s_2)(1) + s_2 = s_1 + s_2 - s_1 - 2s_2 + s_2 = 0$.\nA quadratic polynomial $ax^2+bx+c$ with roots $x_1, x_2$ can be factored as $a(x-x_1)(x-x_2)$. The product of the roots is $x_1 x_2 = c/a$. Let $p^*_1 = 1$. The other root, $p^*_2$, which corresponds to the internal equilibrium, is:\n$$ (1) \\cdot p^*_2 = \\frac{s_2}{s_1 + s_2} $$\nTherefore, the internal equilibrium frequency is:\n$$ p^* = \\frac{s_2}{s_1 + s_2} $$\nGiven the constraints $s_1 > 0$ and $s_2 > 0$, it is clear that $0 < s_2 < s_1 + s_2$, which implies $0 < p^* < 1$.
