Once the adaptive immune response is engaged, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) recognize and lyse infected cells. Let $I(t)$ denote the number of infected cells at time $t$, let $E$ denote the dimensionless CTL frequency (the fraction of CTLs among lymphocytes), and let $k$ denote the per capita lysis rate constant, such that CTL-mediated killing scales as mass action with term $k E I$.

Do not round your answer.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the minimal cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) frequency, denoted as $E_{\\mathrm{min}}$, that guarantees the control of an intracellular parasitic infection. The dynamics of the number of infected cells, $I(t)$, are provided by the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dt} = r I - k E I\n$$\nwhere $r$ is the effective per capita replication rate of the infected cell population, $k$ is the per capita lysis rate constant mediated by CTLs, $E$ is the dimensionless CTL frequency, and $I$ is the number of infected cells. All parameters $r$ and $k$ are inherently positive constants, representing a biological rate of production and clearance, respectively.\n\nThe condition for \"control of infection\" is explicitly defined in the problem statement as a \"monotonic decline of $I(t)$ for all $I(t) > 0$\". A monotonic decline of a function implies that its first derivative is strictly negative. Applying this definition to $I(t)$, the mathematical condition for control is:\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dt} < 0\n$$\nTo find the condition on $E$ that satisfies this requirement, we substitute the given differential equation into the inequality:\n$$\nr I - k E I < 0\n$$\nThis inequality must hold for any positive number of infected cells, i.e., for all $I > 0$. We can factor out the term $I$ from the left-hand side of the inequality:\n$$\nI (r - k E) < 0\n$$\nGiven that $I > 0$, the term $I$ is a positive quantity. Therefore, we can divide both sides of the inequality by $I$ without changing the direction of the inequality sign. This yields:\n$$\nr - k E < 0\n$$\nTo determine the required CTL frequency $E$, we solve this linear inequality for $E$. Adding $k E$ to both sides, we get:\n$$\nr < k E\n$$\nSince the lysis rate constant $k$ is a positive physical parameter ($k>0$), we can divide both sides by $k$ without altering the inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{r}{k} < E\n$$\nThis inequality, $E > \\frac{r}{k}$, provides the condition that the CTL frequency $E$ must satisfy to ensure that the infected cell population $I(t)$ declines over time. The ratio $\\frac{r}{k}$ represents a critical threshold. If the CTL frequency is above this value, the rate of CTL-mediated killing ($kEI$) is greater than the rate of production of new infected cells ($rI$), resulting in a net decrease in the infected cell population.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimal CTL frequency, $E_{\\mathrm{min}}$, that guarantees control. This quantity corresponds to the critical threshold value that separates the regime of infection growth ($E < \\frac{r}{k}$) from the regime of infection control ($E > \\frac{r}{k}$). This boundary value is the greatest lower bound (infimum) of the set of all frequencies $E$ that ensure control. Therefore, the minimal frequency is defined by the equality case:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{r}{k}\n$$\nAt this specific frequency, $\\frac{dI}{dt} = 0$, representing an equilibrium where the infection is held in check but not cleared. Any frequency $E$ strictly greater than $E_{\\mathrm{min}}$ will lead to the monotonic decline stipulated in the problem.

For each patient, the lab measures Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and Interleukin 4 (IL-4) in the supernatant and computes a cytokine signature as the ratio $R = \\dfrac{\\text{IFN-}\\gamma}{\\text{IL-}4}$. To stabilize variance and make distributions comparable across patients and assay runs, the lab uses the base-$10$ logarithm $X = \\log_{10}(R)$. Gold-standard adjudication (by microscopy, polymerase chain reaction, and clinical criteria) assigns patients to one of two classes: class $1$ is intracellular protozoal infection with expected T helper type $1$ (Th$1$) polarization, and class $2$ is helminth infection with expected T helper type $2$ (Th$2$) polarization.\n\nUse the following foundational facts as your starting point:\n- Innate and adaptive coordination: dendritic cell-derived Interleukin $12$ (IL-$12$) and natural killer (NK) cells promote IFN-γ production and T helper type $1$ differentiation, enabling macrophage activation and intracellular parasite control; type $2$ innate cues (e.g., epithelial alarmins) and basophils/type $2$ innate lymphoid cells promote IL-$4$/IL-$5$/IL-$13$, enabling eosinophil activation, immunoglobulin E (IgE), and anti-helminth responses.\n- In stimulated whole-blood assays, cytokine concentrations across individuals are multiplicative and approximately log-normal; ratios reduce inter-individual and batch scaling, while log-ratios often approximate normal distributions.\n- In this lab’s dataset, $X$ is approximately Gaussian within each class with equal variance: for class $1$, $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_1, \\sigma^2)$ with $\\mu_1 = 0.7$ and $\\sigma = 0.3$; for class $2$, $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_2, \\sigma^2)$ with $\\mu_2 = -0.2$ and the same $\\sigma = 0.3$.\n- In the target clinic, the prior probability of class $1$ is $\\pi_1 = 0.4$ and of class $2$ is $\\pi_2 = 0.6$. The relative cost of misclassifying class $1$ as class $2$ is $C_{1\\to 2} = 3$ (reflecting risk of undertreating an intracellular protozoal infection), whereas misclassifying class $2$ as class $1$ costs $C_{2\\to 1} = 1$.\n\nA single-threshold rule $t$ on $X$ is to be deployed: if $X \\ge t$, classify as Th$1$-dominant (class $1$); otherwise classify as Th$2$-dominant (class $2$). Which option best explains the immunological rationale for using an IFN-γ/IL-$4$ signature, correctly links innate-to-adaptive polarization, and justifies an appropriate cutoff by minimizing expected misclassification cost under the stated distributions, priors, and costs?\n\nA. The IFN-γ/IL-$4$ ratio captures Th$1$ versus Th$2$ polarization because IFN-γ (amplified by NK cells and IL-$12$) marks macrophage-activating responses needed for intracellular protozoa, whereas IL-$4$ marks helminth-oriented responses; taking $X = \\log_{10}(R)$ makes the class-conditional distributions approximately Gaussian and stabilizes scale. With unequal priors and asymmetric costs, a Bayes risk-minimizing threshold solves a likelihood-ratio condition, yielding $t \\approx 0.18$, which shifts left of the midpoint to penalize missing Th$1$ cases more heavily.\n\nB. A biologically intuitive cutoff is $t = 0$ because $X = 0$ means $R = 1$, so IFN-γ simply exceeds IL-$4$ in Th$1$ states. Because biology determines the direction of the effect, priors and costs do not change the cutoff, and the log transform is unnecessary for decision-making.\n\nC. Because IFN-γ is the critical anti-protozoal cytokine, use its absolute concentration alone: declare class $1$ if IFN-γ exceeds $10$ pg/mL, otherwise class $2$. Ratios can be misleading if IL-$4$ is low, so the denominator should be ignored; priors and costs are secondary once the dominant cytokine is identified.\n\nD. The equal-variance Gaussians imply a simple midpoint threshold, so set $t = (\\mu_1 + \\mu_2)/2 = 0.25$. The midpoint is robust, and the innate phase does not materially affect an adaptive readout, making priors and costs largely irrelevant.\n\nE. To guarantee sensitivity for protozoal infections, choose $t$ so that class $1$ sensitivity is approximately $95\\%$: with $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0.7, 0.3^2)$ for class $1$, set $t \\approx \\mu_1 - 1.645\\,\\sigma \\approx 0.21$.

Incorrect.** A threshold of $t=0$ (where IFN-γ = IL-4) is arbitrary and suboptimal because it ignores the actual distributions of the data for each class and, critically, disregards the influence of prior probabilities and misclassification costs on the optimal decision boundary.\n\n- **C. Incorrect.** This option discards the ratiometric approach, which is a key feature for controlling experimental variability. Using an absolute concentration is less robust. It also wrongly dismisses the importance of priors and costs in formal decision-making.\n\n- **D. Incorrect.** The midpoint threshold $t=0.25$ is only optimal when priors are equal and costs are symmetric. Neither is true here.
