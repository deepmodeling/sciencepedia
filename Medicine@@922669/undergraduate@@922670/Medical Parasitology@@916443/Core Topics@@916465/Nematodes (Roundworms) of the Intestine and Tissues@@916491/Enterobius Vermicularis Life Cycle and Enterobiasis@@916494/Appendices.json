The description of *Enterobius vermicularis* behavior, the use of the perianal tape test, and the definition of sensitivity are all factually correct.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary definitions, variables ($S_1$, $n$), and conditions (independence) to derive a unique mathematical relationship and calculate a specific numerical value.\n- **Objective:** The language is precise, quantitative, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. The assumptions of constant sensitivity and independence across tests are explicitly stated, which are standard for modeling such a process.\n- **Realism:** The scenario is realistic. Multiple tests are indeed recommended for pinworm diagnosis precisely because the sensitivity of a single test is not $100\\%$.

By definition, this is the probability of a positive test on any given morning for an infected individual.\n$$P(\\text{Test is positive}) = S_1$$\nThe complementary event is that the test is negative. The probability of a single test being negative is:\n$$P(\\text{Test is negative}) = 1 - P(\\text{Test is positive}) = 1 - S_1$$\nThe problem states that tests on $n$ consecutive mornings are independent events. The composite sensitivity, which we can denote as $S_n$, is the probability of detecting the infection. Detection occurs if at least one of the $n$ tests is positive. Therefore, $S_n$ is the probability of \"at least one positive test\" in $n$ trials.\n\nAs suggested, the probability of \"at least one success\" is most easily calculated as one minus the probability of \"no successes.\" In this context, \"no successes\" means all $n$ tests are negative.\nThe probability of all $n$ independent tests being negative is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(\\text{All } n \\text{ tests are negative}) = \\underbrace{(1 - S_1) \\times (1 - S_1) \\times \\dots \\times (1 - S_1)}_{n \\text{ times}}$$\n$$P(\\text{All } n \\text{ tests are negative}) = (1 - S_1)^n$$\nThe composite sensitivity $S_n$ is the probability of the complementary event, i.e., at least one test being positive.\n$$S_n = 1 - P(\\text{All } n \\text{ tests are negative})$$\nSubstituting the expression derived above, we obtain the general formula for the composite sensitivity across $n$ mornings:\n$$S_n = 1 - (1 - S_1)^n$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nFor the second part, we must evaluate this expression for the given values: $n=3$ and $S_1=0.6$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula for $S_n$:\n$$S_3 = 1 - (1 - 0.6)^3$$\nFirst, calculate the term inside the parentheses:\n$$1 - 0.6 = 0.4$$\nNext, compute the exponentiation:\n$$(0.4)^3 = 0.4 \\times 0.4 \\times 0.4 = 0.16 \\times 0.4 = 0.064$$\nFinally, subtract this result from $1$:\n$$S_3 = 1 - 0.064 = 0.936$$\nThus, the composite sensitivity across $3$ mornings, with a single-test sensitivity of $0.6$, is $0.936$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of epidemiology and diagnostic testing, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation. The provided values for prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity are plausible for the described scenario involving *Enterobius vermicularis* detection.\n\nThe task is to derive the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) from first principles and then calculate its numerical value. The PPV is defined as the probability that an individual is truly infected given that their test result is positive.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $I$: The event that an individual is infected with *Enterobius vermicularis*.\n- $I^c$: The event that an individual is not infected.\n- $T^+$: The event that the test result is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the test result is negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following information, which we formalize using probabilistic notation:\n1.  The prevalence of the infection, $P(I)$, is given as $0.05$.\n    $$P(I) = 0.05$$\n    From this, the probability of an individual not being infected is:\n    $$P(I^c) = 1 - P(I) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$$\n\n2.

A positive result can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios:\n1.  The individual is infected and tests positive (a true positive). The probability of this is $P(I \\cap T^+)$.\n2.  The individual is not infected and tests positive (a false positive).

Consider a household in which each day there are multiple independent opportunities for ingestion of eggs, and let each potential exposure have a baseline per-event transmission probability $q$ in the absence of handwashing. Suppose that for any given exposure event, a person performs effective handwashing with probability $p$ (compliance), and that when handwashing occurs the per-event transmission probability is multiplied by a constant factor $r$ with $0 < r < 1$ (that is, the risk of transmission during that event is reduced to $rq$).

Do not use a percent sign.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and evaluation of the fractional reduction in daily transmission probability of *Enterobius vermicularis* when handwashing compliance increases.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the probability of transmission for a single exposure event. Let $p$ be the probability of performing effective handwashing (compliance). The probability of not performing handwashing is therefore $1-p$. Let $q$ be the baseline per-event transmission probability in the absence of handwashing. The problem states that when handwashing is performed, this probability is reduced to $rq$, where $r$ is a constant factor such that $0 < r < 1$.\n\nWe can calculate the overall probability of transmission for a single event, which we denote as $P_{event}$, using the law of total probability. An event can be partitioned into two mutually exclusive outcomes: handwashing is performed, or handwashing is not performed.\n\nThe probability of transmission is the sum of the probabilities of two joint events: (1) transmission occurs AND handwashing is performed, and (2) transmission occurs AND handwashing is not performed.\n\nThe probability of the first joint event is the product of the probability of performing handwashing ($p$) and the conditional probability of transmission given that handwashing was performed ($rq$). This gives $p \\times (rq)$.\nThe probability of the second joint event is the product of the probability of not performing handwashing ($1-p$) and the conditional probability of transmission given that no handwashing was performed ($q$). This gives $(1-p) \\times q$.\n\nThus, the total probability of transmission for a single event is:\n$$P_{event} = (p \\times rq) + ((1-p) \\times q)$$\n$$P_{event} = prq + q - pq$$\nFactoring out $q$ gives:\n$$P_{event} = q(pr + 1 - p)$$\nFurther rearrangement yields:\n$$P_{event} = q(1 - p(1-r))$$\n\nThe problem states that there are multiple, say $N$, independent exposure opportunities per day. It also provides a critical simplifying assumption: because $q$ is small, the daily transmission probability, $P_{daily}$, can be approximated by the sum of the per-event probabilities. This is the first-order term of the more exact calculation $1 - (1-P_{event})^N \\approx N \\times P_{event}$ for small $P_{event}$.\n\nTherefore, the daily transmission probability as a function of compliance $p$ is:\n$$P_{daily}(p) \\approx N \\times P_{event} = Nq(1 - p(1-r))$$\n\nWe are interested in the change in this probability as compliance increases from an initial level $p_1$ to a new level $p_2$.\nThe daily probability at compliance $p_1$ is:\n$$P_{daily,1} = Nq(1 - p_1(1-r))$$\nThe daily probability at compliance $p_2$ is:\n$$P_{daily,2} = Nq(1 - p_2(1-r))$$\n\nThe fractional reduction in daily transmission probability, which we denote as $F_R$, is defined as the absolute reduction in probability ($P_{daily,1} - P_{daily,2}$) divided by the initial probability ($P_{daily,1}$).\n\n$$F_R = \\frac{P_{daily,1} - P_{daily,2}}{P_{daily,1}}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the daily probabilities:\n$$F_R = \\frac{Nq(1 - p_1(1-r)) - Nq(1 - p_2(1-r))}{Nq(1 - p_1(1-r))}$$\n\nThe term $Nq$ appears in both the numerator and the denominator, and since $N>0$ and $q>0$, it can be canceled out.
