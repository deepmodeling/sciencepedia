It describes a classic clinical presentation of cutaneous larva migrans, a well-documented parasitic skin infestation. The provided data are quantitative and consistent. The task is a direct application of fundamental kinematics (the definition of average speed) to a real-world biological scenario. The parameters ($L_i$, $L_f$, $\\Delta t$) are physically realistic for this condition. No scientific principles are violated, no essential information is missing, and the problem is free of ambiguity or contradiction.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid and a full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe fundamental principle for this problem is the definition of average speed, or in this context, the mean rate of advance, denoted by $\\bar{v}$. The average speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the elapsed time. In this case, the distance traveled is the net increase in the length of the track, $\\Delta L$, over the time interval $\\Delta t$.\n\nThe formula is:\n$$ \\bar{v} = \\frac{\\Delta L}{\\Delta t} $$\n\nThe net increase in the track length, $\\Delta L$, is the difference between the final length, $L_f$, and the initial length, $L_i$.\n$$ \\Delta L = L_f - L_i $$\n\nThe givens are:\n- Initial length: $L_i = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- Final length: $L_f = 2.1\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- Time interval: $\\Delta t = 3\\,\\mathrm{days}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total advancement of the track, $\\Delta L$:\n$$ \\Delta L = 2.1\\,\\mathrm{cm} - 1.2\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 0.9\\,\\mathrm{cm} $$\n\nNext, we compute the mean daily advance, $\\bar{v}$, by dividing the total advancement by the time interval:\n$$ \\bar{v} = \\frac{0.9\\,\\mathrm{cm}}{3\\,\\mathrm{days}} = 0.3\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{cm}}{\\mathrm{day}} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in millimeters per day ($\\mathrm{mm/day}$). We use the conversion factor $1\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$ \\bar{v} = 0.3\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{cm}}{\\mathrm{day}} \\times \\left(\\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{1\\,\\mathrm{cm}}\\right) = 3\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mm}}{\\mathrm{day}} $$\n\nThe problem explicitly requests the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $3$. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $3.00$.\n$$ \\bar{v} = 3.00\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mm}}{\\mathrm{day}} $$\n\nFinally, an interpretation is required regarding the compatibility of this result with the known clinical behavior of CLM. The problem states that CLM tracks are known to advance \"a few millimeters per day\". Our calculated mean daily advance of $3.00\\,\\mathrm{mm/day}$ falls squarely within this expected range. An advance of a few millimeters per day is a hallmark of this condition, distinguishing it from other dermatoses. Therefore, the observed kinetics are entirely consistent with and supportive of a clinical diagnosis of cutaneous larva migrans.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.00}\n$$", "id": "4426288"}, {"introduction": "After suspecting cutaneous larva migrans, a common next thought is to obtain a tissue sample for definitive diagnosis. This practice challenges that impulse, forcing a deeper consideration of the parasite's biology, the geometry of the lesion, and the potential for iatrogenic harm. This problem will help you develop the crucial clinical skill of weighing the diagnostic yield of a procedure against its risks, and knowing when non-invasive methods are superior [@problem_id:4426347].", "problem": "A traveler returns from a subtropical beach with pruritic, serpiginous tracks on the plantar forefoot. The longest visible track measures an arc-length of approximately $L = 120\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and has a width of about $w = 2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. On clinical grounds, you suspect cutaneous larva migrans caused by an animal hookworm species. In cutaneous larva migrans, the larva typically resides within the superficial epidermis, advancing at a rate on the order of $v \\approx 20\\text{–}30\\,\\mathrm{mm/day}$.\n\nThe dermatology team proposes a $d = 4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ punch biopsy to “catch” the larva. However, you recall that the larva occupies only a short segment near the advancing tip (on the order of $l \\sim 1\\text{–}2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$), and that biopsy scheduling could lag by $1$–$2$ days. You also note the plantar location’s high functional demand and propensity for painful scarring. Consider the following reasoning framework grounded in fundamental definitions and well-tested observations:\n- Skin anatomy and parasite biology: Cutaneous larva migrans is confined to the stratum corneum and viable epidermis, creating a tunnel and an advancing leading edge; the larva’s body length is short compared to the total track.\n- Basic probability and geometry: The chance that a randomly placed punch intersects a small, moving target along a long track depends on the ratio of target length to total track length and the punch diameter; the larva’s movement during scheduling delay further decouples planned placement from actual position.\n- Wound mechanics and scarring: A circular punch of diameter $d$ removes an area $A = \\pi (d/2)^2$, and on weight-bearing plantar skin, even small scars can be symptomatic and functionally problematic.\n\nWhich option best integrates these first principles to explain why biopsy is often discouraged in cutaneous larva migrans and recommends scientifically sound alternatives to confirm the diagnosis?\n\nA. Because the larva occupies only the short leading segment ($l \\ll L$) and continues to migrate ($v$ non-zero), a single $d = 4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ punch randomly placed has a low probability of sampling the larva; meanwhile, a plantar punch creates a wound area $A = \\pi (2\\,\\mathrm{mm})^2 \\approx 12.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$, risking painful scar. Prefer non-invasive confirmation using dermoscopy to visualize the serpiginous tunnel, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) to detect a refractile organism in the superficial epidermis, and a therapeutic trial with oral ivermectin or albendazole demonstrating arrest of migration within $24$–$48\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n\nB. A deep incisional biopsy down to subcutis increases yield because the larva commonly resides in the dermis and deeper; excising the entire track both treats and diagnoses. Confirmation should rely on stool ova and parasites and serum antibodies against Ancylostoma species.\n\nC. Biopsy is discouraged because the larva secretes anticoagulants causing uncontrolled bleeding from the biopsy site; best confirmation is Gram stain and aerobic/anaerobic bacterial culture from the track fluid.\n\nD. A $1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ shave from any portion of the track suffices because the larva sheds abundant antigen along the entire tunnel; confirmation is analogous to superficial fungal infection using potassium hydroxide preparation from scale and empiric topical corticosteroids to reduce inflammation.\n\nE. The main issue with biopsy is that ultrasound guidance would be required to locate a deeply seated larva; thus avoid biopsy and confirm with high-frequency ultrasound and patch testing to aeroallergens to rule out mimickers such as contact dermatitis.", "solution": "The problem asks for a scientifically reasoned justification for why a skin biopsy is generally discouraged for diagnosing classic cutaneous larva migrans (CLM), and to identify the best alternative diagnostic approach from a list of options. The validation of the problem statement is the mandatory first step.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   Clinical presentation: Pruritic, serpiginous tracks on the plantar forefoot after travel to a subtropical beach.\n-   Track dimensions: Length $L = 120\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, width $w = 2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n-   Larva properties: Resides at the leading edge, body length $l \\sim 1\\text{–}2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, migrates at $v \\approx 20\\text{–}30\\,\\mathrm{mm/day}$.\n-   Proposed procedure: $d = 4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ punch biopsy.\n-   Delay: Potential scheduling lag of $1\\text{–}2$ days.\n-   Anatomical consideration: Plantar location is weight-bearing and prone to painful scarring.\n-   Reasoning framework: Integrate parasite biology, probability/geometry, and wound mechanics.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The scenario is a classic presentation of CLM. The parasite's location (superficial epidermis), mobility, and dimensions are all medically accurate. The risks associated with plantar biopsies are well-established principles in dermatology and podiatry.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides sufficient qualitative and quantitative information to evaluate the risks and benefits of the proposed biopsy. It clearly frames the task as a clinical reasoning challenge.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated factually and asks for an evaluation based on established scientific and clinical principles.\n\nThe problem does not violate any scientific principles, is self-contained, and is free from contradiction or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed by systematically analyzing the reasoning and evaluating the given options.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in a risk-benefit analysis of performing a punch biopsy for CLM.\n\n1.  **Low Diagnostic Yield (Low Benefit)**:\n    -   **Geometric Mismatch**: The target (the larva) is very small ($l \\approx 1\\text{–}2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) compared to the total area of suspicion (the entire track, $L = 120\\,\\mathrm{mm}$).\n    -   **Mobile Target**: The larva is not static; it moves. A delay of $t=1\\text{–}2$ days means the larva could have migrated a distance of $\\Delta x = v \\times t \\approx (20\\,\\mathrm{mm/day}) \\times (2\\,\\mathrm{days}) = 40\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ or more from its last known position. Attempting to biopsy the \"leading edge\" is a guess, as the visible inflammation can lag behind the actual organism.\n    -   **Low Probability**: The probability of a $d=4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ punch capturing a moving $1\\text{–}2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ target that could be anywhere along a potential path of $40\\text{–}60\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ is extremely low. A negative biopsy result is therefore uninformative and does not rule out the diagnosis.\n\n2.  **High Procedural Risk (High Cost)**:\n    -   **Wound Creation**: A $d=4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ punch biopsy creates a full-thickness skin wound. The area of tissue removed is $A = \\pi (d/2)^2 = \\pi (4\\,\\mathrm{mm}/2)^2 = 4\\pi \\approx 12.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$.\n    -   **Location**: The plantar surface is a mechanically stressed, weight-bearing area. Wounds here are notoriously painful, slow to heal, and have a higher risk of infection and developing into a tender, hyperkeratotic scar that can cause chronic pain with ambulation. The iatrogenic harm from a low-yield diagnostic procedure is not justified.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n-   **A. Correct.** This option perfectly integrates the principles. It correctly identifies the low probability of success due to the small, mobile larva ($l \\ll L, v$ is non-zero) and the significant risk of a painful plantar scar (calculating the area $A \\approx 12.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$). Crucially, it recommends the scientifically sound, non-invasive, and effective alternatives: clinical/dermoscopic observation and a therapeutic trial, which serves as both treatment and confirmation. RCM is also a valid, though less common, high-tech option.\n-   **B. Incorrect.** This is factually wrong on multiple counts. The larva is confined to the epidermis in CLM, not the dermis or subcutis. A deep incisional biopsy is inappropriate and dangerous. Stool examination and serology are not useful for diagnosing this non-systemic, dead-end zoonotic infection.\n-   **C. Incorrect.** The primary issue is not anticoagulant secretion or bleeding. Gram stain and culture are used to diagnose secondary bacterial infection, not the parasite itself.\n-   **D. Incorrect.** The entire tunnel does not contain diagnostically useful material for a KOH prep, which is used for fungal infections. A shave biopsy would likely miss the larva. Empiric corticosteroids can mask the lesion's progression and are not a diagnostic tool.\n-   **E. Incorrect.** Ultrasound is not the standard tool for this superficial condition, and the larva is not \"deeply seated\". Patch testing is irrelevant as it is used for allergic contact dermatitis, a completely different immunologic process.\n\nBased on this analysis, option A provides the most accurate and clinically sound reasoning.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4426347"}, {"introduction": "With a diagnosis established and a treatment plan in place, the final step is accurate execution.

The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Solution**\n\nFirst, the target dose for the patient is calculated based on their body mass. Let $D_{target}$ be the target dose, $D_{rate}$ be the dose per kilogram, and $m$ be the patient's mass.\nThe given dose rate is $D_{rate} = 200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{kg}$ and the mass is $m = 68\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n\n$$D_{target} = D_{rate} \\times m = (200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{kg}) \\times (68\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 13600\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$$\n\nNext, this target dose is converted from micrograms ($\\mu\\mathrm{g}$) to milligrams ($\\mathrm{mg}$) using the given conversion factor $1\\,\\mathrm{mg} = 1000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$.\n\n$$D_{target, \\mathrm{mg}} = 13600\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{1000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}} = 13.6\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding this value to four significant figures. To express $13.6$ with four significant figures, a trailing zero is added.\nRounded target dose = $13.60\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n\nThe available tablets have a strength of $S_T = 3\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, and only whole tablets can be administered. Let $n$ be the integer number of tablets. The administered dose, $D_{admin}$, is given by:\n\n$$D_{admin}(n) = n \\times S_T = n \\times 3\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nWe must find the integer $n$ that satisfies two conditions:\n1.

The number of tablets that would theoretically yield this dose is $13.6 / 3 \\approx 4.53$. Therefore, we should investigate the integer options closest to this value, which are $n=4$ and $n=5$.\n\nFor $n=4$ tablets:\nThe administered dose is $D_{admin}(4) = 4 \\times 3\\,\\mathrm{mg} = 12\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\nThe absolute relative deviation is:\n$$\\delta(4) = \\frac{|12 - 13.6|}{13.6} = \\frac{1.6}{13.6} \\approx 0.1176$$\nSince $0.1176 \\le 0.15$, this option is acceptable.\n\nFor $n=5$ tablets:\nThe administered dose is $D_{admin}(5) = 5 \\times 3\\,\\mathrm{mg} = 15\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\nThe absolute relative deviation is:\n$$\\delta(5) = \\frac{|15 - 13.6|}{13.6} = \\frac{1.4}{13.6} \\approx 0.1029$$\nSince $0.1029 \\le 0.15$, this option is also acceptable.\n\nWe can check $n=3$ and $n=6$ to confirm they are not acceptable.\nFor $n=3$, $D_{admin}(3) = 9\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. $\\delta(3) = \\frac{|9 - 13.6|}{13.6} = \\frac{4.6}{13.6} \\approx 0.338 > 0.15$.
