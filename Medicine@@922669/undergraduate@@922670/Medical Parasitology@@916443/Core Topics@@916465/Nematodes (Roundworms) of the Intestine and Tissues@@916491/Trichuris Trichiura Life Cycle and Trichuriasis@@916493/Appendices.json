Mastering this skill is crucial for avoiding misidentification and ensuring correct patient management.", "problem": "A microscopist in a stool diagnostic laboratory must differentiate whipworm eggs of Trichuris trichiura from eggs of capillariid nematodes based solely on bright-field microscopy. The foundational facts available are the following: eggs of Trichuris trichiura are classically barrel-shaped with conspicuous bipolar plugs, have a smooth shell, and typically measure length in the range of $50$–$55$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ and width in the range of $22$–$24$ $\\mu\\text{m}$. Eggs of capillariid nematodes (family Capillariidae) can also be barrel-shaped with bipolar plugs but frequently exhibit distinct shell striations; reported sizes vary by species, with some species producing smaller eggs (for example, length approximately $36$–$45$ $\\mu\\text{m}$) and others larger eggs (for example, length approximately $60$–$70$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ and width approximately $30$–$35$ $\\mu\\text{m}$). The laboratory’s micrometer calibration yields a measurement error with an approximately symmetric, zero-mean distribution and a standard deviation of $\\sigma = 1.5$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ for both length and width; for practical decision-making, the laboratory treats $\\pm 2\\sigma$ (that is, $\\pm 3$ $\\mu\\text{m}$) as encompassing most measurement variability.\n\nUsing only these foundational facts, derive a decision rule that minimizes misclassification in practice by integrating shell ornamentation and measured dimensions in light of the stated measurement error. Then, select the option that best explains why capillariid eggs can be mistaken for Trichuris trichiura and provides a decision rule consistent with those principles.\n\nWhich option is most appropriate?\n\nA. Capillariid eggs are sometimes barrel-shaped with bipolar plugs, which mirrors Trichuris trichiura; however, capillariid eggs typically have distinct shell striations, whereas Trichuris trichiura eggs have smooth shells. A practical decision rule is: first, if distinct shell striations are present, classify as capillariid; second, if the shell is smooth, classify as Trichuris trichiura only if measured length falls within $[50 - 3,\\, 55 + 3]$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ and measured width within $[22 - 3,\\, 24 + 3]$ $\\mu\\text{m}$; otherwise classify as capillariid.\n\nB. Capillariid eggs lack bipolar plugs, unlike Trichuris trichiura. Therefore, a rule that minimizes misclassification is to classify any egg with bipolar plugs as Trichuris trichiura and any egg without plugs as capillariid, irrespective of shell ornamentation or dimensions.\n\nC. Capillariid eggs are darker in color and float differently in fecal concentration techniques than Trichuris trichiura. Thus, a robust rule is to classify based on color intensity and flotation behavior rather than shell features or dimensions, as these are less affected by measurement error.\n\nD. Capillariid eggs are barrel-shaped with bipolar plugs like Trichuris trichiura, so shape and plugs are not discriminative. The most parsimonious size-only rule is to classify any egg with measured length in $[40,\\, 65]$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ as Trichuris trichiura and otherwise as capillariid, since this interval covers likely measurement deviations.", "solution": "The problem statement is first validated for scientific soundness, consistency, and completeness before proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe foundational facts provided are as follows:\n- **Organisms for differentiation:** Whipworm eggs (*Trichuris trichiura*) versus eggs of capillariid nematodes.\n- **Diagnostic method:** Bright-field microscopy.\n- **Characteristics of *Trichuris trichiura* eggs:**\n    - Shape: Classically barrel-shaped.\n    - Plugs: Conspicuous bipolar plugs.\n    - Shell: Smooth.\n    - Length: Typically $50$–$55$ $\\mu\\text{m}$.\n    - Width: Typically $22$–$24$ $\\mu\\text{m}$.\n- **Characteristics of capillariid nematode eggs:**\n    - Shape: Can also be barrel-shaped.\n    - Plugs: Can have bipolar plugs.\n    - Shell: Frequently exhibit distinct shell striations.\n    - Size: Varies by species. Examples include smaller species (length approx. $36$–$45$ $\\mu\\text{m}$) and larger species (length approx. $60$–$70$ $\\mu\\text{m}$, width approx. $30$–$35$ $\\mu\\text{m}$).\n- **Measurement Uncertainty:**\n    - Source: Laboratory micrometer calibration.\n    - Error distribution: Approximately symmetric, zero-mean.\n    - Standard deviation: $\\sigma = 1.5$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ for both length and width.\n    - Practical range for variability: $\\pm 2\\sigma$, which equals $\\pm 3$ $\\mu\\text{m}$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated based on the established criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly based in medical parasitology. The morphological descriptions of *Trichuris trichiura* and capillariid eggs (e.g., *Capillaria philippinensis*, *Aonchotheca putorii*) are factually correct and represent a standard diagnostic challenge in clinical and veterinary laboratories. The use of morphometrics and the consideration of measurement error are standard scientific practice.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It asks for the derivation of a decision rule to minimize misclassification, based on a finite and clearly defined set of features and constraints. The objective is clear, and the provided data are sufficient to construct a logical, hierarchical classification algorithm.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms. There are no subjective or opinion-based claims.\n- **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup:** The problem is internally consistent and complete. It provides all necessary parameters (morphological features, typical dimensions, measurement uncertainty) to formulate the requested decision rule. The apparent overlap in features (barrel shape, bipolar plugs) is the central challenge to be resolved, not a contradiction.\n- **Unrealistic or Infeasible:** The scenario is highly realistic. The specified egg dimensions and features are accurate, and accounting for a measurement error of $\\sigma = 1.5$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ is a plausible and practical consideration in microscopy.\n- **Summary of Validation:** The problem is scientifically sound, well-defined, objective, and internally consistent. It poses a realistic diagnostic puzzle that can be solved using logical deduction based on the provided facts.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Optimal Decision Rule\nThe goal is to create a decision rule that minimizes misclassification by integrating the given features: shell ornamentation and dimensions, while accounting for measurement error. A hierarchical approach, prioritizing the most definitive feature, is optimal.\n\n1.  **Analyze Discriminatory Power of Features:**\n    - **Shape and Plugs:** Both egg types are described as potentially being barrel-shaped with bipolar plugs. Therefore, these features are not reliable for differentiation and cannot be the primary basis for classification.\n    - **Shell Ornamentation:** *Trichuris trichiura* eggs have a smooth shell. Capillariid eggs *frequently* have distinct shell striations. The presence of striations is a strong positive predictor for capillariids. Its absence is inconclusive, as some capillariids may lack prominent striations, or they may be difficult to resolve. This makes shell ornamentation a powerful, albeit one-sided, initial test.\n    - **Dimensions:** The typical size ranges are distinct but close enough that measurement error can cause overlap.\n        - *T. trichiura* true length: $[50, 55]$ $\\mu\\text{m}$. True width: $[22, 24]$ $\\mu\\text{m}$.\n        - The practical measurement range for *T. trichiura*, accounting for the $\\pm 3$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ ($2\\sigma$) error, is:\n            - Length: $[50 - 3, 55 + 3]$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ = $[47, 58]$ $\\mu\\text{m}$.\n            - Width: $[22 - 3, 24 + 3]$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ = $[19, 27]$ $\\mu\\text{m}$.\n        - Capillariid eggs can be smaller (e.g., measured length near $[36-3, 45+3] = [33, 48]$ $\\mu\\text{m}$) or larger (e.g., measured length near $[60-3, 70+3] = [57, 73]$ $\\mu\\text{m}$). There is a small overlap region (e.g., $47-48$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ and $57-58$ $\\mu\\text{m}$).\n\n2.  **Construct the Hierarchical Decision Rule:**\n    - **Step 1 (Primary Criterion):** Examine the shell. The presence of distinct striations is a strong indicator.\n        - If distinct shell striations are present $\\rightarrow$ Classify as **capillariid**.\n    - **Step 2 (Secondary Criterion):** If the shell is smooth, the egg could be *T. trichiura* or a capillariid with a smooth shell. In this case, morphometrics become the deciding factor. The egg is compared against the expected measured size range for *T. trichiura*.\n        - If the shell is smooth **AND** measured length is within $[47, 58]$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ **AND** measured width is within $[19, 27]$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ $\\rightarrow$ Classify as ***Trichuris trichiura***.\n    - **Step 3 (Default Classification):** If an egg with a smooth shell has dimensions that fall *outside* the *T. trichiura* range, it is highly unlikely to be *T. trichiura*. Given the alternatives provided, it should be classified as a capillariid.\n        - If the shell is smooth **AND** the dimensions do not meet the criteria in Step 2 $\\rightarrow$ Classify as **capillariid**.\n\nThis derived rule uses all available information in a logical sequence to minimize misclassification, consistent with the problem's requirements.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Capillariid eggs are sometimes barrel-shaped with bipolar plugs, which mirrors Trichuris trichiura; however, capillariid eggs typically have distinct shell striations, whereas Trichuris trichiura eggs have smooth shells. A practical decision rule is: first, if distinct shell striations are present, classify as capillariid; second, if the shell is smooth, classify as Trichuris trichiura only if measured length falls within $[50 - 3,\\, 55 + 3]$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ and measured width within $[22 - 3,\\, 24 + 3]$ $\\mu\\text{m}$; otherwise classify as capillariid.**\n- **Analysis:** This option perfectly matches the hierarchical decision rule derived above. It correctly identifies the ambiguity of shape/plugs and the primary diagnostic value of shell striations. It then uses the size of smooth-shelled eggs as a secondary criterion, correctly applying the specified measurement error of $\\pm 3$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ to the typical *T. trichiura* dimensions. The final \"otherwise classify as capillariid\" clause correctly handles smooth eggs that do not fit the size profile of *T. trichiura*.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Capillariid eggs lack bipolar plugs, unlike Trichuris trichiura. Therefore, a rule that minimizes misclassification is to classify any egg with bipolar plugs as Trichuris trichiura and any egg without plugs as capillariid, irrespective of shell ornamentation or dimensions.**\n- **Analysis:** This option makes a factually incorrect claim based on the problem statement. The problem explicitly states that eggs of capillariid nematodes \"can have bipolar plugs\". Therefore, the premise of this option is false, and the resulting classification rule is invalid.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Capillariid eggs are darker in color and float differently in fecal concentration techniques than Trichuris trichiura. Thus, a robust rule is to classify based on color intensity and flotation behavior rather than shell features or dimensions, as these are less affected by measurement error.**\n- **Analysis:** This option introduces information not provided in the problem statement. The task is to \"Using **only these foundational facts**\". The facts given are restricted to shell morphology, dimensions, and measurement error. Color and flotation behavior are not included. Thus, this option violates the constraints of the problem.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Capillariid eggs are barrel-shaped with bipolar plugs like Trichuris trichiura, so shape and plugs are not discriminative. The most parsimonious size-only rule is to classify any egg with measured length in $[40,\\, 65]$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ as Trichuris trichiura and otherwise as capillariid, since this interval covers likely measurement deviations.**\n- **Analysis:** This option correctly notes that shape and plugs are not discriminative but then proposes a flawed \"size-only\" rule. This rule improperly ignores the significant diagnostic information provided by shell striations. Furthermore, the proposed length interval of $[40, 65]$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ is poorly constructed. It would misclassify many capillariid eggs as *T. trichiura* (e.g., a small capillariid measuring $44$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ or a large one measuring $62$ $\\mu\\text{m}$). This does not minimize misclassification; it creates a rule with low specificity. The derived range $[47, 58]$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ is the correct one based on the provided data.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4817686"}, {"introduction": "Moving from individual diagnosis to public health, we must assess the overall infection burden within a community. Helminth infections like trichuriasis are rarely distributed evenly; instead, they follow an 'aggregated' pattern where most people have light infections and a few are heavily infected.

Arithmetic and geometric means are identical at large sample sizes, so the choice of mean is irrelevant even in the presence of extreme values.", "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific and logical integrity.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   **Topic:** Monitoring of *Trichuris trichiura* infection intensity.\n-   **Metric:** Eggs per gram (EPG) of stool.\n-   **Measurement Method:** Kato-Katz thick smear.\n-   **Distribution Characteristic:** Aggregated (overdispersed), right-skewed, multiplicative nature.\n-   **Initial Data Set:** $X = \\{3, 8, 12, 20, 25, 40, 55, 80, 120\\}$, with sample size $n = 9$.\n-   **Expanded Data Set:** $Y = X \\cup \\{3000\\}$, with sample size $n = 10$.\n-   **Objective:** Compare the response of the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean to the introduction of the extreme value ($3000$ EPG) and use this comparison to justify the preference for the geometric mean in this context.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is scientifically sound. The description of parasite egg counts (specifically for soil-transmitted helminths like *T. trichiura*) as having an aggregated or overdispersed distribution is a fundamental concept in parasitology and quantitative epidemiology. This pattern, where most hosts have low parasite burdens and a few hosts have very high burdens, is well-documented and is often modeled using a negative binomial distribution. The use of Kato-Katz EPG counts is a standard diagnostic and monitoring tool.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, presenting a realistic scenario from quantitative parasitology. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is to compare the robustness of two measures of central tendency—the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean—when applied to a right-skewed dataset, which is characteristic of parasite counts.\n\n**1. Definition of Means**\nThe arithmetic mean ($\\bar{x}_A$) of a set of $n$ numbers $\\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n\\}$ is given by:\n$$ \\bar{x}_A = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i $$\nThe geometric mean ($\\bar{x}_G$) is given by:\n$$ \\bar{x}_G = \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\right)^{1/n} $$\nFor computational purposes, especially with non-integer or large values, the geometric mean is more conveniently calculated using logarithms. It is the exponential of the arithmetic mean of the natural logarithms of the values:\n$$ \\bar{x}_G = \\exp\\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln(x_i) \\right) $$\nThis formulation reveals that the geometric mean effectively performs averaging on a logarithmic scale.\n\n**2. Calculations for the Initial Data Set $X$**\nThe initial data set is $X = \\{3, 8, 12, 20, 25, 40, 55, 80, 120\\}$ with $n=9$.\n\n-   **Arithmetic Mean of $X$ ($\\bar{x}_{A,X}$):**\n    $$ \\sum_{i=1}^{9} x_i = 3 + 8 + 12 + 20 + 25 + 40 + 55 + 80 + 120 = 363 $$\n    $$ \\bar{x}_{A,X} = \\frac{363}{9} \\approx 40.33 \\text{ EPG} $$\n\n-   **Geometric Mean of $X$ ($\\bar{x}_{G,X}$):**\n    First, we find the sum of the natural logarithms of the values:\n    $$ \\sum_{i=1}^{9} \\ln(x_i) = \\ln(3) + \\ln(8) + \\dots + \\ln(120) \\approx 1.0986 + 2.0794 + 2.4849 + 2.9957 + 3.2189 + 3.6889 + 4.0073 + 4.3820 + 4.7875 \\approx 28.7432 $$\n    $$ \\bar{x}_{G,X} = \\exp\\left( \\frac{28.7432}{9} \\right) = \\exp(3.1937) \\approx 24.38 \\text{ EPG} $$\n\n**3. Calculations for the Expanded Data Set $Y$**\nThe expanded data set is $Y = \\{3, 8, 12, 20, 25, 40, 55, 80, 120, 3000\\}$ with $n=10$.\n\n-   **Arithmetic Mean of $Y$ ($\\bar{x}_{A,Y}$):**\n    $$ \\sum_{i=1}^{10} y_i = \\left(\\sum x_i\\right) + 3000 = 363 + 3000 = 3363 $$\n    $$ \\bar{x}_{A,Y} = \\frac{3363}{10} = 336.3 \\text{ EPG} $$\n\n-   **Geometric Mean of $Y$ ($\\bar{x}_{G,Y}$):**\n    We add the logarithm of the new value, $\\ln(3000) \\approx 8.0064$:\n    $$ \\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\ln(y_i) = \\left(\\sum \\ln(x_i)\\right) + \\ln(3000) \\approx 28.7432 + 8.0064 = 36.7496 $$\n    $$ \\bar{x}_{G,Y} = \\exp\\left( \\frac{36.7496}{10} \\right) = \\exp(3.6750) \\approx 39.45 \\text{ EPG} $$\n\n**4. Comparison and Interpretation**\n-   **Change in Arithmetic Mean:** The arithmetic mean increased from $\\approx 40.33$ to $336.3$. This is an increase of a factor of $\\frac{336.3}{40.33} \\approx 8.34$.\n-   **Change in Geometric Mean:** The geometric mean increased from $\\approx 24.38$ to $\\approx 39.45$. This is an increase of a factor of $\\frac{39.45}{24.38} \\approx 1.62$.\n\nThe introduction of a single extreme value (an outlier) caused the arithmetic mean to increase by over $800\\%$, dramatically shifting the measure of central tendency. In contrast, the geometric mean increased by only about $62\\%$. This demonstrates that the arithmetic mean is highly sensitive to outliers, whereas the geometric mean is far more robust.\n\nIn the context of aggregated parasite distributions, where most individuals have low egg counts and a few have very high counts, the arithmetic mean will be heavily skewed upwards by these few \"super-shedders\". The geometric mean, by averaging on a logarithmic scale, down-weights the influence of these extreme values and provides a more stable estimate of the \"typical\" infection intensity in the population. For programmatic monitoring over time, a stable indicator is crucial to reliably assess the impact of interventions (e.g., mass drug administration) and to avoid misleading conclusions based on the random sampling of one or two heavily infected individuals.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The geometric mean, by averaging on the logarithmic scale, reduces the influence of extreme high EPG values and better captures the typical infection level in an aggregated distribution, yielding more stable indicators across survey rounds; the arithmetic mean is highly sensitive to occasional heavy shedders and therefore fluctuates widely.**\nThis statement is entirely consistent with our calculations and the principles of quantitative epidemiology. The calculation showed that the geometric mean is significantly more stable (robust) than the arithmetic mean in the presence of an outlier. The reasoning provided—averaging on a log scale, reducing the influence of extreme values, better capturing typical levels in aggregated distributions, and providing a stable indicator—is precisely the justification for its use. **Correct**.\n\n**B. The arithmetic mean should be preferred because it gives greater weight to heavily infected individuals who are the main drivers of transmission; its sensitivity to extreme values is desirable for program monitoring.**\nWhile it is true that heavily infected individuals are critical for transmission, using a highly unstable indicator like the arithmetic mean for routine population-level monitoring is problematic. Its sensitivity makes it difficult to distinguish true trends from sampling noise. A public health program needs to distinguish between a genuine rise in community-wide infection and the chance inclusion of a single outlier. Therefore, for assessing population-level trends, this sensitivity is generally considered a disadvantage, not desirable. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The geometric mean is preferred solely because Trichuris eggs are non-motile and sink in stool, minimizing laboratory counting errors; therefore any averaging method performs equivalently.**\nThis statement conflates two unrelated concepts. The physical properties of parasite eggs (e.g., density influencing floatation or sedimentation) affect the diagnostic performance of a specific laboratory technique (like Kato-Katz or a flotation method). This is a matter of measurement accuracy and precision. The choice between an arithmetic and geometric mean is a statistical decision based on the underlying distribution of the data, not the physical properties of what is being counted. Furthermore, the assertion that \"any averaging method performs equivalently\" is demonstrably false, as proven by the calculations. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Arithmetic and geometric means are identical at large sample sizes, so the choice of mean is irrelevant even in the presence of extreme values.**\nThis statement is mathematically false. The arithmetic-geometric mean inequality states that the arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean ($\\bar{x}_A \\ge \\bar{x}_G$), with equality holding only if all values in the dataset are identical. For a skewed distribution, these two means will not converge to the same value, regardless of the sample size. The presence of extreme values will always have a disproportionate effect on the arithmetic mean. Consequently, the choice of mean remains highly relevant. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4817678"}, {"introduction": "Once we can identify and quantify an infection, the next step is to strategize its control.

Your task is to derive the 'critical coverage threshold,' a calculation that directly informs how much effort is needed to interrupt transmission and work towards elimination.", "problem": "A rural community is experiencing high transmission of the human whipworm, Trichuris trichiura. Adult worms residing in the large intestine shed unembryonated eggs into the environment; after development in moist soil, eggs become infective and ingestion leads to establishment of new adult worms. The basic reproduction number, denoted by $R_0$, is defined as the average number of new infections produced by a single typical infection in an otherwise susceptible population with no intervention. In this setting, periodic Mass Drug Administration (MDA) targets human hosts to reduce the population of fecund adult worms and thereby reduce environmental egg contamination and onward transmission.\n\nAssume the following well-tested modeling assumptions grounded in the parasite’s life cycle and transmission ecology:\n- A fraction $c$ of the population receives MDA in a given round.\n- The drug efficacy $e$ is the probability that treatment removes (or sterilizes) an adult worm in a treated host during the intervention period.\n- The average force of transmission and environmental egg contamination scale linearly with the fraction of adult worm burden that remains after treatment, and mixing is homogeneous over the short time horizon considered.\n\nLet $R_{\\text{eff}}$ denote the effective reproduction number under the MDA intervention. Using the fundamental definition of $R_0$ and the above assumptions, formulate $R_{\\text{eff}}$ in terms of $R_0$, $c$, and $e$, impose the condition required for elimination ($R_{\\text{eff}} < 1$), and solve for the minimal coverage threshold $c^{*}$ that makes this inequality hold.

Coverage $c$ and efficacy $e$ are dimensionless fractions in the interval $[0,1]$.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the minimal Mass Drug Administration (MDA) coverage threshold, denoted as $c^*$, necessary to achieve the elimination of *Trichuris trichiura*. Elimination is defined by the condition that the effective reproduction number, $R_{\\text{eff}}$, is less than $1$. The derivation must be based on the provided modeling assumptions.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, and the effective reproduction number, $R_{\\text{eff}}$. The basic reproduction number, $R_0$, represents the transmission potential in an untreated population. The problem states that the force of transmission scales linearly with the population's total adult worm burden. We can therefore express the reproduction number as being directly proportional to the average worm burden, $W$, in the population. In the absence of intervention, let the average worm burden be $W_0$. Thus, we can write:\n$$R_0 \\propto W_0$$\n\nThe intervention consists of administering a drug to a fraction $c$ of the population. The drug has an efficacy $e$, which is the probability that an adult worm is removed or sterilized in a treated individual.\n\nWe can now calculate the new average worm burden in the population following the MDA, which we will denote as $W_{\\text{eff}}$. The population is divided into two groups: the untreated fraction, $(1-c)$, and the treated fraction, $c$.\n-   The untreated individuals, comprising a fraction $(1-c)$ of the population, retain their original worm burden. Assuming a homogeneous distribution, their average burden remains $W_0$.\n-   The treated individuals, comprising a fraction $c$ of the population, experience a reduction in their worm burden by a factor of $e$. Their post-treatment average burden is thus $(1-e)W_0$.\n\nThe new population-wide average worm burden, $W_{\\text{eff}}$, is the weighted average of the burdens in these two subgroups:\n$$W_{\\text{eff}} = (1-c) \\cdot W_0 + c \\cdot (1-e) \\cdot W_0$$\n\nFactoring out $W_0$:\n$$W_{\\text{eff}} = W_0 \\left[ (1-c) + c(1-e) \\right]$$\n$$W_{\\text{eff}} = W_0 [ 1 - c + c - ce ]$$\n$$W_{\\text{eff}} = W_0 (1 - ce)$$\n\nThe term $(1 - ce)$ represents the fraction of the total worm burden remaining in the population after the intervention. Since the force of transmission and, consequently, the reproduction number are proportional to the average worm burden, the effective reproduction number $R_{\\text{eff}}$ is proportional to $W_{\\text{eff}}$ with the same constant of proportionality as $R_0$:\n$$R_{\\text{eff}} \\propto W_{\\text{eff}}$$\n\nWe can now formulate $R_{\\text{eff}}$ in terms of $R_0$ by taking the ratio:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\text{eff}}}{R_0} = \\frac{W_{\\text{eff}}}{W_0} = \\frac{W_0 (1 - ce)}{W_0} = 1 - ce$$\nThis gives the expression for the effective reproduction number under MDA:\n$$R_{\\text{eff}} = R_0 (1 - ce)$$\n\nThe condition for the elimination of the parasite is that each infectious case must, on average, produce less than one new case. This is mathematically stated as:\n$$R_{\\text{eff}} < 1$$\n\nSubstituting our expression for $R_{\\text{eff}}$ into this inequality:\n$$R_0 (1 - ce) < 1$$\n\nWe now solve this inequality for the coverage $c$. The problem is concerned with a \"high transmission\" setting, which implies $R_0 > 1$. If $R_0 \\le 1$, the infection would not persist and no intervention would be needed. Assuming $R_0 > 1$:\n$$1 - ce < \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\n$$-ce < \\frac{1}{R_0} - 1$$\n$$-ce < \\frac{1 - R_0}{R_0}$$\n\nTo isolate the term $ce$, we multiply both sides by $-1$. This operation reverses the direction of the inequality:\n$$ce > -\\left(\\frac{1 - R_0}{R_0}\\right)$$\n$$ce > \\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0}$$\n\nThe drug efficacy $e$ is a probability and lies in the interval $[0, 1]$. For the intervention to have any effect, we must have $e > 0$. Assuming a non-zero efficacy, we can divide by $e$ without changing the inequality's direction:\n$$c > \\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0 e}$$\n\nThis inequality specifies the required coverage $c$ to ensure $R_{\\text{eff}} < 1$. The minimal coverage threshold, $c^*$, is the smallest value of $c$ that satisfies this condition. Therefore, $c^*$ is equal to the lower bound of the inequality:\n$$c^{*} = \\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0 e}$$\n\nThis expression represents the minimal fraction of the population that must be covered by the MDA to drive the parasite population towards extinction, given the parasite's basic reproduction number $R_0$ and the drug's efficacy $e$. This can also be written as $c^* = \\frac{1}{e} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}\\right)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0 e}}$$", "id": "4817602"}]}
