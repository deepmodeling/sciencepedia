Consider the following stage-specific, per-larva survival probabilities, each defined as the conditional probability of progressing from one stage to the next within the same host: survival through gastric digestion in the stomach is $0.8$, successful establishment and maturation in the intestine is $0.5$, survival during hematogenous dissemination is $0.3$, and successful settlement and encystment in muscle is $0.6$. Assume that survival events at each stage are independent given arrival at that stage, and that a larva must traverse all stages in order.\n\nUsing foundational probability principles, including the multiplication rule for independent events and the definition of expected value for a Bernoulli outcome, derive from first principles the expected number of larvae that ultimately establish in muscle per single ingested larva.

Since larvae can be sparsely and randomly distributed, simply testing a small sample may not be enough to declare meat safe.

Working through this scenario will illuminate the statistical principles that underpin modern food safety protocols and diagnostic sensitivity.", "problem": "Trichinella spiralis is detected in meat by the Artificial Digestion Method (ADM), in which a defined mass of muscle is digested and the entire digest is microscopically examined for larvae. In many hosts, encysted larvae are rare and approximately independently distributed in muscle tissue, and the expected count in a sample is proportional to the mass examined. Assume a carcass has a true larval density of $0.5$ larvae per gram, and that the occurrence of larvae in disjoint muscle portions is independent with a constant spatial rate per gram.\n\nUsing the principles of rare independent event counting in space, model the number of larvae observed in a digested muscle sample of mass $m$ grams. From this model, derive the expression for the probability of failing to detect any larvae (that is, observing zero larvae) when examining the entire digest.

This is a classic application of the Poisson distribution.\n\nLet $X$ be the random variable for the number of larvae found in a sample. The probability mass function (PMF) of a Poisson distribution is:\n$$P(X=k) = \\frac{\\mu^k e^{-\\mu}}{k!}$$\nwhere $k$ is the number of observed larvae and $\\mu$ is the average number of larvae in the sample.\n\nThe problem gives the larval density, $\\lambda = 0.5$ larvae/gram. The average number of larvae $\\mu$ in a sample of mass $m$ grams is:\n$$\\mu = \\lambda \\times m = 0.5m$$\nSo, the model for the number of larvae in a sample of mass $m$ is a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu = 0.5m$.\n\nWe need to find the probability of failing to detect any larvae, which means finding $P(X=0)$. Using the Poisson PMF:\n$$P(X=0) = \\frac{(0.5m)^0 e^{-0.5m}}{0!}$$\nSince any number to the power of $0$ is $1$, and $0! = 1$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$P(X=0) = e^{-0.5m}$$\nThis is the general expression for the probability of observing zero larvae in a sample of mass $m$.\n\nNow, we apply this to the two cases.\n\n**Case 1: A single 1 gram sample ($m=1$)**\nThe probability of observing zero larvae, $P_1$, is:\n$$P_1 = e^{-0.5 \\times 1} = e^{-0.5}$$\n$$P_1 \\approx 0.6065306...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.6065$.\n\n**Case 2: A pooled 100 gram sample ($m=100$)**\nThe probability of observing zero larvae, $P_{100}$, is:\n$$P_{100} = e^{-0.5 \\times 100} = e^{-50}$$\n$$P_{100} \\approx 1.928749... \\times 10^{-22}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $1.929 \\times 10^{-22}$.\n\nThe two required probabilities are $0.6065$ for the 1-gram sample and $1.929 \\times 10^{-22}$ for the 100-gram sample.

This advanced exercise guides you through building and analyzing a mathematical model to compare the evolutionary fitness ($R_0$) of these competing strategies [@problem_id:4816863]. By quantifying the trade-offs between fecundity, survival, and host-finding efficiency, you will learn how evolutionary theory can be used to explain why certain life-history traits are adaptive.", "problem": "A parasitic nematode such as Trichinella spiralis completes its life cycle within mammalian hosts: adult worms inhabit the small intestine, newborn larvae migrate to striated muscle, and infective larvae are passed to a new host when muscle tissue is consumed. There is no environmental free-living stage. Using the principle that natural selection favors life-history strategies that maximize the expected number of successful new infections per infection (the basic reproductive number, $R_0$), and modeling outside-host survival and host encounter as memoryless processes with constant hazards, evaluate whether a hypothetical environmental free-living stage would be favored over the carcass-to-host encysted strategy.\n\nAssume two competing strategies for the infective stage:\n\n- Encysted carcass-to-host strategy ($C$): Infective larvae are in muscle of a dead host (a carcass) and are transferred when the carcass is consumed by a carnivore or scavenger. Let the outside-host death hazard be $\\mu_c$ per day, the host encounter (carcass consumption) hazard be $\\lambda_c$ per day, the probability of successful establishment upon ingestion be $p_c$, and the mean newborn larval output per adult female be $f_c$.\n\n- Environmental free-living strategy ($E$): Infective larvae hatch into a motile free-living stage in moist soil and attempt to reach a host (e.g., via contaminating food), but this requires allocation to structures that reduce adult fecundity. Let the outside-host death hazard be $\\mu_e$ per day, the host encounter hazard be $\\lambda_e$ per day, the probability of successful establishment upon entry be $p_e$, and the mean newborn larval output per adult female be $f_e$.\n\nAssume exponentially distributed times to death and to host encounter outside the host, independence of these hazards, and that within-host reproduction is approximately proportional to $f$. For the sake of evaluating trade-offs in transmission reliability, carcass-to-host transfer efficiency, and outside-host mortality, consider the following ecologically plausible parameterization: $\\mu_c = 0.05$ per day, $\\lambda_c = 0.20$ per day, $p_c = 0.90$, $f_c = 1000$; and $\\mu_e = 0.50$ per day, $\\lambda_e = 0.001$ per day, $p_e = 0.60$, $f_e = 500$.\n\nWhich option best justifies why no environmental free-living stage evolved in Trichinella spiralis?\n\nA. Across diverse host communities, the product of outside-host survival and host encounter for carcasses is large relative to soil, and avoiding energy allocation to a free-living stage preserves fecundity; under the given hazards, the expected transmissions per infection are much greater for the carcass route than for an environmental stage, which would often yield $R_0 < 1$.\n\nB. Trichinella spiralis cannot form a cuticle, so an environmental stage is physiologically impossible; the absence of a free-living stage is unrelated to transmission or mortality trade-offs.\n\nC. Because herbivory is the dominant feeding mode among mammals, carcasses are rarely consumed; therefore, an environmental stage would be superior, and the current life cycle is maladaptive.\n\nD. An environmental free-living stage would avoid host immunity entirely and therefore increase fecundity so strongly that it would be favored, even if outside-host mortality and host encounter probabilities are low.\n\nSelect the single best option.", "solution": "The problem asks to evaluate two competing life-history strategies for *Trichinella spiralis* by comparing their basic reproductive number, $R_0$. The fitness of each strategy can be represented by a metric, $W$, which is proportional to $R_0$. This metric is the product of three key factors: the mean fecundity ($f$), the probability of an infective stage surviving to encounter a new host, and the probability of successful establishment in that host ($p$).\n\nThe model treats outside-host survival and host encounter as competing, independent, memoryless processes with constant hazards $\\mu$ (death) and $\\lambda$ (encounter). The probability of a successful host encounter before death is given by the ratio of the encounter hazard to the total hazard:\n$$P(\\text{encounter before death}) = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda + \\mu}$$\nThus, the fitness metric for each strategy is calculated as:\n$$W = f \\times \\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda + \\mu} \\times p$$\n\n**Strategy C: Encysted Carcass-to-Host**\nUsing the given parameters ($f_c = 1000$, $\\mu_c = 0.05$, $\\lambda_c = 0.20$, $p_c = 0.90$):\nThe probability of a larva in a carcass being transmitted successfully is:\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda_c}{\\lambda_c + \\mu_c} = \\frac{0.20}{0.20 + 0.05} = \\frac{0.20}{0.25} = 0.8 $$\nThe fitness metric for Strategy C is:\n$$ W_c = f_c \\times \\frac{\\lambda_c}{\\lambda_c + \\mu_c} \\times p_c = 1000 \\times 0.8 \\times 0.90 = 720 $$\n\n**Strategy E: Environmental Free-Living**\nUsing the given parameters ($f_e = 500$, $\\mu_e = 0.50$, $\\lambda_e = 0.001$, $p_e = 0.60$):\nThe probability of a free-living larva finding and infecting a host is:\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda_e}{\\lambda_e + \\mu_e} = \\frac{0.001}{0.001 + 0.50} = \\frac{0.001}{0.501} \\approx 0.001996 $$\nThe fitness metric for Strategy E is:\n$$ W_e = f_e \\times \\frac{\\lambda_e}{\\lambda_e + \\mu_e} \\times p_e \\approx 500 \\times 0.001996 \\times 0.60 \\approx 0.5988 $$\n\n**Comparison and Evaluation of Options:**\nThe fitness of the carcass strategy ($W_c = 720$) is dramatically higher than that of the hypothetical environmental strategy ($W_e \\approx 0.6$). This indicates that natural selection would strongly favor the existing life cycle. The value $W_e  1$ suggests that the environmental strategy is not sustainable and would lead to parasite extinction (i.e., $R_0  1$).\n\nNow we analyze the options:\n*   **A:** This option correctly identifies all the key factors. The probability of survival and encounter is much higher for carcasses ($0.8$) than soil ($\\approx 0.002$). Avoiding an environmental stage allows for higher fecundity ($f_c > f_e$). The expected transmissions (our metric $W$) are much greater for the carcass route ($720$ vs. $\\approx 0.6$). And the environmental strategy would likely yield $R_0  1$. This aligns perfectly with our calculations.\n*   **B:** This option is factually incorrect; all nematodes, including *Trichinella*, possess a cuticle. It incorrectly dismisses the evolutionary trade-offs.\n*   **C:** This option's conclusion is directly contradicted by our quantitative analysis. The carcass-to-host strategy is shown to be vastly superior, making the current life cycle highly adaptive, not maladaptive.\n*   **D:** This option makes biologically unfounded claims about immunity and fecundity. The quantitative analysis shows that the extremely low probability of host encounter and survival in the environment makes this strategy inviable, regardless of other factors.\n\nTherefore, the calculations and analysis of the underlying evolutionary trade-offs robustly support option A as the correct explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4816863"}]}
