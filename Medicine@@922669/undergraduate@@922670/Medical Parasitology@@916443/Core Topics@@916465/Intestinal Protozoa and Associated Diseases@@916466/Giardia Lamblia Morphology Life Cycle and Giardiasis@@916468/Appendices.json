The solution will now be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three parts as requested: first finding the infectivity parameter $r$, then calculating the probability of infection for the two specified doses.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the infectivity parameter $r$**\nThe dose-response model is given by:\n$$P_{inf}(D) = 1 - \\exp(-rD)$$\nThe Infectious Dose $50$ ($ID_{50}$) is defined as the dose $D$ for which $P_{inf}(D) = 0.5$.

For maximum accuracy, we use the symbolic form of $r$ in the calculation.\n$$P_{inf}(D) = 1 - \\exp(-rD)$$\n$$P_{inf}(10) = 1 - \\exp(-r \\cdot 10) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{25} \\cdot 10\\right)$$\n$$P_{inf}(10) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{10}{25}\\ln(2)\\right) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\ln(2)\\right)$$\nUsing the identity $\\exp(a \\ln(b)) = b^a$:\n$$P_{inf}(10) = 1 - (2)^{-2/5} = 1 - 2^{-0.4}$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$$P_{inf}(10) \\approx 1 - 0.75785814... \\approx 0.24214185...$$\nRounding this to four significant figures gives:\n$$P_{inf}(10) \\approx 0.2421$$\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of $P_{inf}$ for $D = 100$ cysts**\nSimilarly, we calculate the probability of infection for a dose of $100$ cysts.\n$$P_{inf}(100) = 1 - \\exp(-r \\cdot 100) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{25} \\cdot 100\\right)$$\n$$P_{inf}(100) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{100}{25}\\ln(2)\\right) = 1 - \\exp(-4\\ln(2))$$\nAgain, using the identity $\\exp(a \\ln(b)) = b^a$:\n$$P_{inf}(100) = 1 - (2)^{-4} = 1 - \\frac{1}{16}$$\n$$P_{inf}(100) = 1 - 0.0625 = 0.9375$$\nThis result is exact and already has four significant figures, so no rounding is necessary.\n\nThe three requested values, rounded to four significant figures, are:\n- $r \\approx 0.02773$\n- $P_{inf}(10) \\approx 0.2421$\n- $P_{inf}(100) = 0.9375$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0.02773  0.2421  0.9375 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4790658"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of dose-response, this practice explores how public health engineering mitigates the risk of waterborne pathogens like *Giardia*.

All provided parameters are plausible and allow for a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested: computation of the total log reduction and the residual infection risk.\n\n**Part 1: Total Log Reduction**\n\nLogarithmic reduction is a standard measure of the efficacy of a treatment process in reducing the concentration of a contaminant. A log reduction value, $L$, is defined as the base-$10$ logarithm of the ratio of the initial concentration, $C_0$, to the final concentration, $C_f$.\n$$L = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{C_0}{C_f}\\right)$$\nThe problem states that the water treatment consists of two sequential and independent barriers: granular filtration and chlorination.

The model is given by:\n$$P_{inf} = 1 - \\exp(-k \\cdot D)$$\nThis model is derived from the assumption that a single viable organism can cause infection and that the number of organisms that successfully initiate infection follows a Poisson distribution with a mean of $k \\cdot D$.\n\nThe given infectivity constant is $k = 1.99 \\times 10^{-2}$ per cyst.\nThe calculated dose is $D = 0.1$ cysts.\n\nWe substitute these values into the model:\n$$P_{inf} = 1 - \\exp(-(1.99 \\times 10^{-2}) \\cdot (0.1))$$\n$$P_{inf} = 1 - \\exp(-1.99 \\times 10^{-3})$$\n$$P_{inf} = 1 - \\exp(-0.00199)$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\\exp(-0.00199) \\approx 0.998011988$$\n$$P_{inf} \\approx 1 - 0.998011988 = 0.001988012$$\n\nThe problem requires the infection risk to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.

This corresponds to the conditional probability $P(G | T^+)$, where $G$ is the event that the patient has giardiasis and $T^+$ is the event of a positive test result.\n\nFirst, we define the relevant events and extract the given probabilities from the problem statement.\nLet $G$ be the event that the patient has giardiasis.\nLet $G^c$ be the event that the patient does not have giardiasis.\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the stool antigen test is positive.\nLet $T^-$ be the event that the stool antigen test is negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n1.
