By modeling how microscope magnification and observer training quantitatively impact diagnostic accuracy, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the practical skills and quality control measures that are essential in a clinical parasitology laboratory [@problem_id:4781844].", "problem": "A clinical parasitology laboratory is validating microscope-based identification of intestinal protozoa in stool wet mounts. The primary diagnostic distinction is between the ciliated trophozoite of Balantidium coli and the pseudopod-bearing trophozoite of Entamoeba histolytica. Under lower magnification, key morphological cues such as a complete covering of cilia and a characteristic kidney-shaped macronucleus in Balantidium coli can be missed. Under higher magnification, these features are more reliably seen. Laboratory observers undergo targeted training to improve cue recognition.\n\nUse the following fundamental bases:\n- The probability of misidentifying a specimen of Balantidium coli as Entamoeba histolytica equals one minus the probability of correctly classifying the specimen as Balantidium coli when Balantidium coli is truly present (that is, one minus the true-positive classification probability for Balantidium coli under the given conditions).\n- In this validation, classification is binary between Balantidium coli and Entamoeba histolytica once an intestinal protozoan is detected in the field of view.\n\nThe laboratory models the training effect at magnification $m \\in \\{100, 400\\}$ as a linear improvement in correct classification probability with training hours $h$, subject to an optics-limited performance floor. Equivalently, the conditional probability of misidentifying Balantidium coli as Entamoeba histolytica at magnification $m$ after $h$ hours of training is modeled as\n$$\np_{m}(h) \\;=\\; \\max\\!\\left\\{f_{m},\\; p_{0,m} \\;-\\; r_{m}\\,h \\right\\},\n$$\nwhere $p_{0,m}$ is the baseline misidentification probability at $h=0$, $r_{m}$ is the reduction rate per hour, and $f_{m}$ is the minimum achievable misidentification probability due to irreducible limitations at that magnification.\n\nParameter values grounded in pilot observations and the known visibility of cilia and nuclear morphology at the two magnifications are:\n- For $100\\times$: $p_{0,100} = 0.28$, $r_{100} = 0.02\\,\\text{hour}^{-1}$, $f_{100} = 0.01$.\n- For $400\\times$: $p_{0,400} = 0.09$, $r_{400} = 0.015\\,\\text{hour}^{-1}$, $f_{400} = 0.005$.\n\nThe laboratory’s quality target is that, after training, the misidentification probability of Balantidium coli as Entamoeba histolytica must be at most $0.01$ at both $100\\times$ and $400\\times$ magnification.\n\nUsing only the definitions above and the given parameters, derive the misidentification probabilities at $100\\times$ and $400\\times$ as functions of $h$, and compute the minimal training duration $h^{\\star}$ such that $p_{100}(h^{\\star}) \\le 0.01$ and $p_{400}(h^{\\star}) \\le 0.01$ simultaneously.
