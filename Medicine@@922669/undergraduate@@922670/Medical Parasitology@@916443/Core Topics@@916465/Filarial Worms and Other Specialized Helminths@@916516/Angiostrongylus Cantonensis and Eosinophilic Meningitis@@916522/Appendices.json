It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The scenario describes a standard epidemiological unmatched case-control study, and all necessary data for the requested calculations are provided without contradiction or ambiguity. The task is a formal application of established biostatistical methods.\n\nThe data from the unmatched case-control study can be organized into a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table. Let 'Cases' refer to individuals with eosinophilic meningitis and 'Controls' refer to individuals without the illness. Let 'Exposed' refer to the consumption of raw homegrown salad greens and 'Not Exposed' refer to the absence of this consumption. The data are as follows:\n\n-   Number of cases who were exposed: $a = 28$\n-   Number of cases who were not exposed: $c = 22$\n-   Number of controls who were exposed: $b = 12$\n-   Number of controls who were not exposed: $d = 88$\n\nThe total number of cases is $a+c = 28+22=50$. The total number of controls is $b+d = 12+88=100$.\n\nFirst, we compute the odds ratio ($OR$). In a case-control study, the $OR$ is the ratio of the odds of exposure among cases to the odds of exposure among controls.\n\nThe odds of exposure among cases is given by the ratio $\\frac{a}{c}$.\nThe odds of exposure among controls is given by the ratio $\\frac{b}{d}$.\n\nThe odds ratio is therefore:\n$$\nOR = \\frac{a/c}{b/d} = \\frac{ad}{bc}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$\nOR = \\frac{28 \\times 88}{12 \\times 22} = \\frac{2464}{264} = \\frac{28}{3} \\approx 9.3333\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the odds ratio is $9.33$.\n\nNext, we construct the $95\\%$ confidence interval ($CI$) for the odds ratio.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of medical parasitology and disease ecology, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objective in its formulation. All premises, including the life cycle of *Angiostrongylus cantonensis*, its role in eosinophilic meningitis, the concept of overdispersion in parasite counts, and the use of specific probability distributions (Poisson, Negative Binomial) are consistent with established scientific literature.\n\nThe task is to determine the probability that a slug tissue fragment contains at least one third-stage larva (L3) of *A. cantonensis*.\n\nFirst, we must select the appropriate statistical model for the larval count. The problem provides two candidate distributions: the Poisson distribution and the Negative Binomial Distribution (NBD). It is also given that parasite counts are typically aggregated, a condition characterized by the variance of the count distribution exceeding its mean. The provided empirical data for larval intensity (larvae per gram of tissue) are a mean of $\\mu = 12$ and a variance of $\\sigma^{2} = 84$.\n\nWe compare the variance to the mean:\n$$ \\sigma^{2} = 84 > \\mu = 12 $$\nThis condition is known as overdispersion. The Poisson distribution is defined by the property that its mean is equal to its variance ($\\sigma^{2} = \\mu$). Therefore, it is not an appropriate model for these overdispersed data. The Negative Binomial Distribution, however, allows for the variance to be greater than the mean and is the standard model for aggregated counts. The relationship between the mean $\\mu$, variance $\\sigma^2$, and the dispersion parameter $k$ for the NBD is given by:\n$$ \\sigma^{2} = \\mu + \\frac{\\mu^{2}}{k} $$\nThe parameter $k$ is a measure of aggregation; smaller values of $k$ indicate a higher degree of clustering.\n\nUsing the given data for larval intensity per gram, we can solve for the dispersion parameter $k$:\n$$ 84 = 12 + \\frac{12^{2}}{k} $$\n$$ 84 - 12 = \\frac{144}{k} $$\n$$ 72 = \\frac{144}{k} $$\n$$ k = \\frac{144}{72} = 2 $$\nThus, the distribution of L3 larvae per gram of slug tissue follows an NBD with mean $\\mu_I = 12$ and dispersion parameter $k=2$.\n\nNext, we must determine the parameters for the number of larvae, denoted by the random variable $X$, within the specific tissue fragment of mass $m = 0.05$ grams. The problem states that larval counts scale proportionally with mass. This implies that the mean number of larvae in the fragment, $\\mu_X$, is the product of the mean intensity and the fragment's mass.\n$$ \\mu_X = \\mu_I \\times m = 12 \\frac{\\text{larvae}}{\\text{gram}} \\times 0.05 \\text{ grams} = 0.6 \\text{ larvae} $$\nThe dispersion parameter $k$ is an intrinsic property of the aggregation process and does not change with the sample size (mass). Therefore, for the fragment, the larval count $X$ also follows an NBD with parameters $\\mu_X = 0.6$ and $k=2$.\n\nWe are asked to find the probability that the fragment contains at least one larva, which is $P(X \\ge 1)$. This is most easily calculated as the complement of the probability that the fragment contains zero larvae, $P(X=0)$.\n$$ P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X=0) $$\nThe probability mass function for the NBD, giving the probability of observing exactly $j$ events, is:\n$$ P(X=j) = \\binom{j+k-1}{j} \\left( \\frac{k}{\\mu_X+k} \\right)^{k} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_X}{\\mu_X+k} \\right)^{j} $$\nTo find $P(X=0)$, we set $j=0$:\n$$ P(X=0) = \\binom{0+k-1}{0} \\left( \\frac{k}{\\mu_X+k} \\right)^{k} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_X}{\\mu_X+k} \\right)^{0} $$\nSince $\\binom{n}{0} = 1$ and $a^{0}=1$ for any non-zero $a$, this simplifies to:\n$$ P(X=0) = \\left( \\frac{k}{\\mu_X+k} \\right)^{k} $$\nSubstituting the parameters for the fragment, $\\mu_X = 0.6$ and $k=2$:\n$$ P(X=0) = \\left( \\frac{2}{0.6+2} \\right)^{2} = \\left( \\frac{2}{2.6} \\right)^{2} = \\left( \\frac{10}{13} \\right)^{2} = \\frac{100}{169} $$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$ P(X=0) \\approx 0.591715976... $$\nFinally, we calculate the probability of finding at least one larva:\n$$ P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X=0) = 1 - \\frac{100}{169} = \\frac{69}{169} $$\n$$ P(X \\ge 1) \\approx 1 - 0.591715976... = 0.408284023... $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ P(X \\ge 1) \\approx 0.4083 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4083}$$", "id": "4779479"}, {"introduction": "A reliable diagnosis is essential for proper patient management.

The prevalence of the disease, which is the prior probability of a patient having the disease:\n    $$P(D) = p = 0.12$$\n    From this, the probability of a patient not having the disease is:\n    $$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.12 = 0.88$$\n\n2.  The sensitivity of the test, which is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease (the true positive rate):\n    $$P(T^+ | D) = 0.93$$\n\n3.  The specificity of the test, which is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease (the true negative rate):\n    $$P(T^- | D^c) = 0.985$$\n\nFrom these definitions, we can derive two other useful probabilities:\n-   The false negative rate, which is the probability of a negative test given that the patient has the disease:\n    $$P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - 0.93 = 0.07$$\n-   The false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test given that the patient does not have the disease:\n    $$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.985 = 0.015$$\n\nWe are asked to compute the positive predictive value (PPV) and the negative predictive value (NPV).\n\n**1.

Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\nThe NPV is the probability that a patient is truly not infected given that the test result is negative. This is the conditional probability $P(D^c | T^-)$. We again use the principles of conditional probability, analogous to Bayes' theorem:\n$$NPV = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of obtaining a negative test result. It can be found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)$$\nAlternatively, since a test result is either positive or negative, $P(T^-) = 1 - P(T^+)$.\n$$P(T^-) = 1 - 0.1248 = 0.8752$$\nLet's verify this using the first formula:\n$$P(T^-) = (0.985)(0.88) + (0.07)(0.12)$$\n$$P(T^-) = 0.8668 + 0.0084 = 0.8752$$\nThe results match.
