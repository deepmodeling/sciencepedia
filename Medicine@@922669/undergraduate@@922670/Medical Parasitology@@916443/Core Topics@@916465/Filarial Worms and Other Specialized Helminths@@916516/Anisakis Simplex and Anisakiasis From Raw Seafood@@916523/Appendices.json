To quantify risk from first principles in medical parasitology, model the count of larvae per unit mass as a rare-event process: the number of larvae in an ingested mass is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution with a mean proportional to mass, consistent with independent, sparse contamination and spatial homogeneity within the fillet. It is a well-tested food safety fact that proper freezing to the recommended temperatures and durations (for example, $-20\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ for $7$ days or $-35\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ for $15$ hours) inactivates nematode larvae in fish.\n\nSuppose the patient ate $200\\,\\mathrm{g}$ of raw herring sourced from a supplier with a freezing compliance of $0.80$ (that is, with probability $0.80$ the product was properly frozen as above, and with probability $0.20$ it was not properly frozen).

This involves identifying the appropriate probabilistic framework and necessary parameters.\n3.  **Solution Derivations**: We will derive the solution step-by-step, starting from first principles. This will include applying the Law of Total Probability and the properties of the Poisson distribution.\n4.  **Final Calculation**: Finally, we will compute the numerical answer and round it as specified.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\nThe givens extracted from the problem statement are:\n-   Ingested mass of herring, $m = 200\\,\\mathrm{g}$.\n-   The number of larvae, $N$, in an ingested mass follows a Poisson distribution.\n-   The mean of the Poisson distribution is proportional to the mass.\n-   The average contamination level is $1$ larva per $100\\,\\mathrm{g}$.\n-   The probability of compliant freezing is $P(F) = 0.80$.\n-   The probability of non-compliant freezing is $P(F^c) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$.\n-   Condition on compliant freezing: All larvae are inactivated (non-viable).\n-   Condition on non-compliant freezing: Larvae remain viable.\n-   Larval presence and freezing status are independent events.\n-   The objective is to compute the probability of ingesting at least one viable larva.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The use of a Poisson distribution to model rare, randomly distributed contaminants in a medium is a standard and appropriate technique in fields like epidemiology and food safety. The anisakiasis context, the parasite *Anisakis simplex*, and the efficacy of freezing for inactivation are all factually correct and established within medical parasitology. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary data and conditions provided for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. No flaws related to scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, or ambiguity are found. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 2: Problem Analysis and Solution Derivation\n\nLet $V$ be the event that the patient ingests at least one viable larva.\nLet $F$ be the event that the herring was properly frozen according to compliance standards.\nLet $F^c$ be the complement event, that the herring was not properly frozen.\n\nWe are given the probabilities of the freezing status:\n$$P(F) = 0.80$$\n$$P(F^c) = 1 - P(F) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$$\n\nWe can compute the probability of event $V$ using the Law of Total Probability, partitioning the sample space by the events $F$ and $F^c$:\n$$P(V) = P(V|F)P(F) + P(V|F^c)P(F^c)$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the conditional probabilities, $P(V|F)$ and $P(V|F^c)$.\n\nIf the fish was properly frozen (event $F$), the problem states that all larvae are inactivated. This means the number of viable larvae is zero, regardless of how many were initially present. Therefore, the probability of ingesting at least one viable larva, given compliant freezing, is zero.\n$$P(V|F) = 0$$\n\nIf the fish was not properly frozen (event $F^c$), the larvae remain viable. In this case, the event of ingesting at least one viable larva is equivalent to the event of ingesting at least one larva. Let $N$ be the random variable representing the total count of larvae in the ingested portion of fish. The problem states that $N$ follows a Poisson distribution. We have:\n$$P(V|F^c) = P(N \\ge 1)$$\n\nTo determine the parameter $\\lambda$ (the mean) of the Poisson distribution, we use the given contamination rate and the mass of fish consumed.\nThe average rate is $1$ larva per $100\\,\\mathrm{g}$. The patient consumed $200\\,\\mathrm{g}$.\nThus, the mean number of larvae in the consumed portion is:\n$$\\lambda = \\left( \\frac{1 \\text{ larva}}{100\\,\\mathrm{g}} \\right) \\times 200\\,\\mathrm{g} = 2$$\nSo, the number of larvae $N$ in the $200\\,\\mathrm{g}$ portion follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda = 2$, which we write as $N \\sim \\text{Poisson}(2)$.\n\nThe probability of finding at least one larva, $P(N \\ge 1)$, is most easily calculated using the complement event, which is finding zero larvae, $P(N=0)$.\n$$P(N \\ge 1) = 1 - P(N=0)$$\nThe probability mass function for a Poisson distribution is $P(N=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$. For $k=0$, we have:\n$$P(N=0) = \\frac{2^0 \\exp(-2)}{0!} = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\exp(-2)}{1} = \\exp(-2)$$\nTherefore, the conditional probability given non-compliant freezing is:\n$$P(V|F^c) = P(N \\ge 1) = 1 - \\exp(-2)$$\n\nNow we substitute these components back into the Law of Total Probability equation:\n$$P(V) = P(V|F)P(F) + P(V|F^c)P(F^c)$$\n$$P(V) = (0)(0.80) + (1 - \\exp(-2))(0.20)$$\n$$P(V) = 0 + (0.20)(1 - \\exp(-2))$$\n$$P(V) = 0.20(1 - \\exp(-2))$$\n\n### Step 3: Final Calculation\n\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we calculate the value of the expression and round to four significant figures as requested.\nUsing the value $e \\approx 2.71828$:\n$$ \\exp(-2) \\approx 0.13533528 $$\n$$ 1 - \\exp(-2) \\approx 1 - 0.13533528 = 0.86466472 $$\n$$ P(V) \\approx 0.20 \\times 0.86466472 = 0.17293294 $$\n\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $0.1729$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1729}$$", "id": "4779858"}, {"introduction": "Once a viable parasite is ingested, what is the actual probability of becoming ill?

It is based on the standard exponential dose-response model derived from a Poisson process, a foundational concept in quantitative microbial risk assessment. All variables, assumptions, and constants are clearly defined, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Infection Probability Model $P(d)$\n\nLet $X$ be the random variable representing the number of larvae that successfully establish an infection (i.e., the number of initiating events). According to the problem's assumptions, $X$ follows a Poisson distribution. The mean of this distribution, $\\lambda$, is proportional to the ingested dose $d$, with the constant of proportionality being the per-larva initiation rate $r$.\nThus, the mean is given by:\n$$ \\lambda = r d $$\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for a Poisson-distributed random variable $X$ with mean $\\lambda$ is:\n$$ P(X=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!} \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\} $$\nInfection is defined as the event where at least one larva successfully establishes itself, which corresponds to $X \\ge 1$. The probability of this event, denoted as $P(d)$, is therefore $P(X \\ge 1)$.\n\nIt is computationally more straightforward to calculate this probability using the complement rule. The complement of the event $X \\ge 1$ is the event $X=0$ (no larvae establish an infection).\n$$ P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X < 1) = 1 - P(X=0) $$\nWe can find $P(X=0)$ by substituting $k=0$ into the Poisson PMF:\n$$ P(X=0) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{0!} $$\nUsing the identities $\\lambda^0 = 1$ and $0! = 1$, this simplifies to:\n$$ P(X=0) = \\exp(-\\lambda) $$\nSubstituting the expression for the mean, $\\lambda = rd$, we get the probability of no infection:\n$$ P(X=0) = \\exp(-rd) $$\nFinally, the probability of infection, $P(d)$, is:\n$$ P(d) = 1 - P(X=0) = 1 - \\exp(-rd) $$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the infection probability as a function of dose $d$ and per-larva initiation rate $r$. This relationship is known as the exponential dose-response model.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of Infection Probability for a Specific Scenario\n\nThe problem asks for the infection probability for a dose of $d = 5$ larvae and a per-larva initiation rate of $r = 0.05$.\nFirst, we calculate the mean number of initiating events, $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda = r d = (0.05)(5) = 0.25 $$\nNext, we use the derived formula for $P(d)$ with $d=5$:\n$$ P(5) = 1 - \\exp(-(0.05)(5)) = 1 - \\exp(-0.25) $$\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically:\n$$ \\exp(-0.25) \\approx 0.77880078... $$\n$$ P(5) \\approx 1 - 0.77880078 = 0.22119922... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. The first four significant figures are $2$, $2$, $1$, and $1$. The fifth significant figure is $9$, so we round the fourth digit up.\n$$ P(5) \\approx 0.2212 $$\n\n### Part 3: Interpretation of the Risk Curve $P(d)$\n\nThe risk curve is given by the function $P(d) = 1 - \\exp(-rd)$ for $d \\ge 0$.\n\n**Monotonicity**: To analyze the monotonicity, we compute the first derivative of $P(d)$ with respect to $d$:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{d d} = \\frac{d}{d d} \\left( 1 - \\exp(-rd) \\right) = -(-r)\\exp(-rd) = r\\exp(-rd) $$\nSince $r > 0$ and the exponential term $\\exp(-rd)$ is always positive for any finite $d$, the derivative $\\frac{dP}{d d}$ is always positive. This indicates that $P(d)$ is a strictly monotonically increasing function of $d$. This is biologically intuitive: as the number of ingested larvae increases, the probability of at least one of them causing an infection also increases.\n\n**Curvature**: To analyze the curvature, we compute the second derivative of $P(d)$ with respect to $d$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 P}{d d^2} = \\frac{d}{d d} \\left( r\\exp(-rd) \\right) = r(-r)\\exp(-rd) = -r^2\\exp(-rd) $$\nSince $r^2 > 0$ and $\\exp(-rd) > 0$, the second derivative $\\frac{d^2 P}{d d^2}$ is always negative. This indicates that the function $P(d)$ is strictly concave down.\n\n**Qualitative Interpretation**: The shape of the curve reflects the nature of the single-hit process and independent action.\n- At a dose of $d=0$, the risk is $P(0) = 1 - \\exp(0) = 0$, which is logical.\n- At very low doses, the risk increases almost linearly with dose (since for small $x$, $1-\\exp(-x) \\approx x$, so $P(d) \\approx rd$). Each larva contributes substantially to the overall risk because the probability of an infection having already been initiated by another larva is very low.\n- As the dose increases, the curve flattens. This demonstrates a \"law of diminishing returns\". Each additional larva still contributes to the risk, but the *incremental* increase in probability becomes smaller. This is because at higher doses, it is already likely that one of the previously ingested larvae has initiated an infection, so the chance that an additional larva will be the one to change the outcome from 'no infection' to 'infection' decreases.\n- As $d \\to \\infty$, the term $\\exp(-rd) \\to 0$, and the risk $P(d)$ asymptotically approaches $1$. The probability of infection approaches certainty but never reaches it for any finite dose.\n\nThis concave-down, increasing shape is characteristic of single-hit models where independent events can lead to an outcome.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.2212}\n$$", "id": "4779936"}, {"introduction": "When a patient presents with symptoms suggestive of anisakiasis, clinicians use diagnostic tools like skin prick tests or serology to confirm their suspicion.

We use Bayes' theorem to find this value:\n$$PPV = P(S|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|S) P(S)}{P(T^+)}$$\nTo use this formula, we first need to calculate $P(T^+)$, the overall probability of a positive test in the population. We apply the law of total probability:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+|S)P(S) + P(T^+|S^c)P(S^c) $$\nSubstituting the given and derived values:\n$$ P(T^+) = (0.85)(0.10) + (0.10)(0.90) $$\n$$ P(T^+) = 0.085 + 0.090 = 0.175 $$\nNow we can compute the $PPV$:\n$$ PPV = \\frac{P(T^+|S) P(S)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{(0.85)(0.10)}{0.175} = \\frac{0.085}{0.175} $$\n$$ PPV \\approx 0.48571428... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $PPV = 0.4857$.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$)**\n\nThe $NPV$ is the probability that an individual is truly not sensitized given a negative test result, denoted as $P(S^c|T^-)$. We again use Bayes' theorem:\n$$ NPV = P(S^c|T^-) = \\frac{P(T^-|S^c) P(S^c)}{P(T^-)} $$\nFirst, we must calculate $P(T^-)$, the overall probability of a negative test. As $T^+$ and $T^-$ are complementary events, we have:\n$$ P(T^-) = 1 - P(T^+) = 1 - 0.175 = 0.825 $$\nAlternatively, we can use the law of total probability for $P(T^-)$:\n$$ P(T^-) = P(T^-|S)P(S) + P(T^-|S^c)P(S^c) $$\n$$ P(T^-) = (0.15)(0.10) + (0.90)(0.90) $$\n$$ P(T^-) = 0.015 + 0.810 = 0.825 $$\nBoth methods yield the same result, confirming our calculation.
