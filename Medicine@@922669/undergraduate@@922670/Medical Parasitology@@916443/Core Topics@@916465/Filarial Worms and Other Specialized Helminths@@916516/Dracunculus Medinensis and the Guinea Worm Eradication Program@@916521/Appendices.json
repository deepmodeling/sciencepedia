The description of the life cycle and transmission of *Dracunculus medinensis* (Guinea worm) via copepods in drinking water is a well-established fact in medical parasitology. The modeling assumptions—uniform distribution, independent infection events (Bernoulli trials), and ingestion proportional to volume—are standard and reasonable simplifications used in epidemiological modeling to approximate real-world scenarios. The parameter values provided are plausible for an endemic region pre-eradication. The topic is correctly situated within medical parasitology and public health.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It requests the derivation of a specific probability under a clear set of assumptions and then a numerical calculation using given parameters. The information provided is self-contained and sufficient to determine a unique, meaningful solution.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated in objective, formal language, free of bias, subjectivity, or opinion-based assertions.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, non-formalizability, incompleteness, contradiction, unfeasibility, or ill-posed structure. It is a standard, solvable problem in applied probability theory relevant to epidemiology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet $P_I$ be the probability of ingesting at least one infected copepod in a single drink of volume $V$.\nThe givens are:\n- The density of copepods in the water is $n$ copepods per liter.\n- The volume of water drunk is $V$ liters.\n- The probability that any single copepod is infected is $p$.\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of copepods ingested, which we shall denote as $N_{total}$. According to the problem statement, a person drinking $V$ liters ingests exactly $nV$ copepods.\n$$N_{total} = nV$$\n\nEach of these $N_{total}$ copepods is an independent Bernoulli trial concerning its infection status. The two possible outcomes for each trial (i.e., for each copepod) are \"infected\" or \"not infected\".\n- The probability of a single copepod being infected is $p$.\n- The probability of a single copepod *not* being infected is, therefore, $1-p$.\n\nThe event of interest is \"ingesting at least one infected copepod\". Directly calculating this probability would require summing the probabilities of ingesting exactly one, exactly two, ..., up to exactly $N_{total}$ infected copepods. A more direct approach is to calculate the probability of the complementary event and subtract it from $1$.\n\nThe complementary event, which we denote as $A^c$, is \"ingesting zero infected copepods\". This occurs if and only if *all* $N_{total}$ ingested copepods are not infected.\nThe event is the intersection of $N_{total}$ independent events:\n$$A^c = (\\text{copepod 1 is not infected}) \\cap (\\text{copepod 2 is not infected}) \\cap \\dots \\cap (\\text{copepod } N_{total} \\text{ is not infected})$$\n\nDue to the stated independence of infection status for each copepod, the probability of this compound event is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$P(A^c) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N_{total}} P(\\text{copepod } i \\text{ is not infected})$$\nSince the probability of any single copepod not being infected is $1-p$, this simplifies to:\n$$P(A^c) = (1-p)^{N_{total}}$$\nSubstituting our expression for $N_{total}$:\n$$P(A^c) = (1-p)^{nV}$$\n\nThe probability of the original event, $P_I$, is $1$ minus the probability of its complement:\n$$P_I = 1 - P(A^c)$$\nTherefore, the general formula for the probability of ingesting at least one infected copepod is:\n$$P_I = 1 - (1-p)^{nV}$$\nThis completes the derivation from first principles.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nWe are now required to evaluate this probability for the specific values:\n- $n = 30$ copepods/liter\n- $p = 0.015$\n- $V = 2.5$ liters\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of copepods ingested, $N_{total}$:\n$$N_{total} = nV = (30 \\text{ L}^{-1}) \\times (2.5 \\text{ L}) = 75$$\nSo, a total of $75$ copepods are ingested. Each represents an independent Bernoulli trial with a success (infection) probability of $p=0.015$.\n\nNow, we substitute these values into our derived formula for $P_I$:\n$$P_I = 1 - (1 - 0.015)^{75}$$\n$$P_I = 1 - (0.985)^{75}$$\n\nWe calculate the value of $(0.985)^{75}$:\n$$(0.985)^{75} \\approx 0.32191535$$\n\nFinally, we calculate $P_I$:\n$$P_I = 1 - 0.32191535 = 0.67808465$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $6$, $7$, $8$, and $0$. The fifth digit is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$P_I \\approx 0.6781$$\nThis is the probability of ingesting at least one infected copepod from a $2.5$-liter drink of water under the specified conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6781}$$", "id": "4786526"}, {"introduction": "A cornerstone of the Guinea Worm Eradication Program is vector control—targeting the copepod intermediate hosts to break the parasite's life cycle.

This final practice integrates several key concepts by asking you to evaluate the combined impact of two independent interventions: water filtration and case containment.

The district’s baseline is $R_0 = 1.5$.

The starting point is the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, which represents the transmission potential in the absence of these interventions.\n\nThe effective reproduction number, $R_t$, is related to the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, by incorporating the effects of control measures. Since the interventions are stated to be independent and act multiplicatively, we can write $R_t$ as the product of $R_0$ and the reduction factors corresponding to each intervention.\nLet's denote the reduction factor due to case containment as $r_c$ and the reduction factor due to water filtration as $r_f$. The relationship is then:\n$$R_t = R_0 \\cdot r_c \\cdot r_f$$\n\nFirst, we determine the reduction factor from case containment, $r_c$.\nThe problem states that a fraction $c = 0.7$ of symptomatic cases are effectively contained, which eliminates their ability to contaminate water sources and contribute to onward transmission. This means that only the remaining fraction of cases, which is $1-c$, can transmit the parasite. Therefore, the overall transmission from infectious individuals is reduced by this factor.\n$$r_c = 1 - c$$\nSubstituting the given value $c = 0.7$:\n$$r_c = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3$$\n\nNext, we determine the reduction factor from household-level water filtration, $r_f$.\nThis intervention reduces the susceptibility of the population to infection by preventing the ingestion of infected copepods.
