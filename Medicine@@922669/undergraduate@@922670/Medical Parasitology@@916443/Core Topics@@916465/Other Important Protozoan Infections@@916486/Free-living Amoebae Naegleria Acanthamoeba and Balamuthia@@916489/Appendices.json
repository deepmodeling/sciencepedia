It provides all necessary and consistent data to compute the temperature coefficient, $Q_{10}$, and discuss its biological implications for *Naegleria fowleri*. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nThe temperature coefficient, denoted as $Q_{10}$, is a measure of the rate of change of a biological or chemical process as a consequence of increasing the temperature by $10^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. The general formula for $Q_{10}$ is given by:\n$$\nQ_{10} = \\left( \\frac{R_2}{R_1} \\right)^{\\frac{10}{T_2 - T_1}}\n$$\nwhere $R_1$ is the measured rate at temperature $T_1$ and $R_2$ is the measured rate at temperature $T_2$. The temperatures are typically expressed in degrees Celsius.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following values:\nTemperature $T_1 = 30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\nMetabolic rate at $T_1$: $R_1 = 1.95 \\, \\text{nmol} \\, \\mathrm{O}_2 \\, \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$ per $10^6$ cells\nTemperature $T_2 = 40^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\nMetabolic rate at $T_2$: $R_2 = 4.22 \\, \\text{nmol} \\, \\mathrm{O}_2 \\, \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$ per $10^6$ cells\n\nFirst, we calculate the temperature difference, $\\Delta T = T_2 - T_1$:\n$$\n\\Delta T = 40^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} - 30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} = 10^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the exponent of the $Q_{10}$ formula:\n$$\n\\frac{10}{T_2 - T_1} = \\frac{10}{10} = 1\n$$\nThis simplifies the calculation, as the problem is designed around the fundamental definition of $Q_{10}$ over a $10$-degree interval. The formula reduces to a direct ratio of the rates:\n$$\nQ_{10} = \\frac{R_2}{R_1}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given metabolic rates into this simplified formula. The units (nmol $\\mathrm{O}_2\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$ per $10^6$ cells) are identical for both rates and will cancel, yielding a dimensionless number as required.\n$$\nQ_{10} = \\frac{4.22}{1.95} \\approx 2.16410256...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nQ_{10} \\approx 2.16\n$$\n\nHaving calculated the value of $Q_{10}$, we consider its implications. Under nutrient-replete conditions as specified, the metabolic rate, measured here as oxygen consumption, is directly coupled to anabolic processes such as biosynthesis and replication. A higher metabolic rate provides the energy and building blocks necessary for a higher specific growth rate ($\\mu$), leading to more rapid cell proliferation.\n\nThe calculated value of $Q_{10} \\approx 2.16$ indicates that for every $10^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ rise in temperature within the range of $30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to $40^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, the metabolic activity of *Naegleria fowleri* more than doubles. This strong positive temperature dependence is characteristic of a thermophilic (heat-loving) organism.\n\nThe implications for *Naegleria* proliferation in warm waters are significant. The high $Q_{10}$ value quantitatively explains why populations of this amoeba can expand rapidly in freshwater bodies (lakes, ponds, rivers, and hot springs) when water temperatures increase, particularly during hot summer months. This temperature-driven proliferation elevates the concentration of amoebic trophozoites in the water. Since human infection—Primary Amebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM)—occurs when water containing the amoeba is forcibly insufflated into the nasal cavity, a higher density of the organism in the environment directly increases the probability of exposure and the risk of contracting this almost invariably fatal disease. Therefore, the temperature sensitivity quantified by $Q_{10}$ is a critical factor in the epidemiology and ecology of *Naegleria fowleri*, linking environmental temperature to public health risk. Changes in global or local temperatures, such as those due to climate change or thermal pollution from industrial sources, can be expected to expand the geographic range and seasonal windows for hazardous *Naegleria* blooms.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2.16}\n$$", "id": "4789682"}, {"introduction": "Once an individual is exposed to contaminated water, infection is a matter of probability, not certainty.

This approach is a valid and established method for modeling infectious disease transmission where exposure consists of discrete pathogenic units. The biological context, infection by *Naegleria fowleri*, is a recognized topic in medical parasitology.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem statement is clear, and all necessary variables and parameters ($C, F, t, P_{inf, obs}$) are provided to determine the unknown parameter $\\alpha$. The question is structured to first require a general derivation and then a specific calculation, which is a logical and solvable sequence.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal and quantitative, free from subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is deemed valid as it is self-contained, scientifically sound, and well-posed.\n\n**Derivation of the Infection Probability**\nLet $N$ be the random variable representing the number of pathogenic organisms that reach the olfactory mucosa during the contact time $t$. As per the problem statement, $N$ follows a Poisson distribution with a mean (or intensity parameter) $\\lambda$.\n$$ \\lambda = E[N] = C F t $$\nThe probability mass function of $N$ is given by:\n$$ P(N=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}, \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\nEach of these $k$ organisms acts as an independent Bernoulli trial, with a probability of success (initiating infection) equal to $\\alpha$. An infection occurs if at least one organism successfully invades. Let $M$ be the random variable for the number of successful invasions. The overall probability of infection, $P_{inf}$, is $P(M \\geq 1)$. This is equivalent to $1 - P(M=0)$.\n\nWe calculate the probability of no infection, $P(M=0)$, using the law of total probability, by conditioning on the number of organisms $N$ that arrive:\n$$ P(M=0) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} P(M=0 | N=k) \\cdot P(N=k) $$\nGiven $k$ organisms, the probability that none of them cause an infection is $(1-\\alpha)^k$, since they are independent.\n$$ P(M=0 | N=k) = (1-\\alpha)^k $$\nSubstituting this and the Poisson probability into the summation:\n$$ P(M=0) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (1-\\alpha)^k \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!} $$\nWe can factor out the term $\\exp(-\\lambda)$ which is constant with respect to the summation index $k$:\n$$ P(M=0) = \\exp(-\\lambda) \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\lambda(1-\\alpha))^k}{k!} $$\nThe summation is the Taylor series expansion for the exponential function, $\\exp(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^k}{k!}$, with $x = \\lambda(1-\\alpha)$.\n$$ \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\lambda(1-\\alpha))^k}{k!} = \\exp(\\lambda(1-\\alpha)) $$\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$ P(M=0) = \\exp(-\\lambda) \\cdot \\exp(\\lambda(1-\\alpha)) = \\exp(-\\lambda + \\lambda - \\lambda\\alpha) = \\exp(-\\lambda\\alpha) $$\nTherefore, the probability of infection (at least one successful invasion) is:\n$$ P_{inf} = 1 - P(M=0) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda\\alpha) $$\nSubstituting $\\lambda = C F t$, we arrive at the final expression for the infection probability:\n$$ P_{inf}(C, F, t, \\alpha) = 1 - \\exp(-\\alpha C F t) $$\n\n**Biological Interpretation of $\\alpha$**\nThe parameter $\\alpha$, the per-organism invasion efficiency, is a dimensionless probability that represents the virulence of a single *Naegleria fowleri* amoeba at the host-pathogen interface. It quantifies the likelihood that one organism, upon reaching the olfactory mucosa, will successfully execute the entire sequence of biological processes required for invasion—adherence, cytotoxicity, penetration of the epithelial barrier, and traversal along the olfactory nerves to the brain—while evading immediate local host defenses. It is a critical parameter in risk assessment models, linking the dose of exposure to the probability of an adverse outcome.\n\n**Calculation of the Maximum Likelihood Estimate for $\\alpha$**\nWe are asked to find the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of $\\alpha$. Given that the problem provides a fixed, empirically observed infection probability ($P_{inf, obs} = 0.26$), the MLE for $\\alpha$ is the value that makes the model's predicted probability equal to this observed probability.\n$$ P_{inf}(C, F, t, \\alpha) = P_{inf, obs} $$\n$$ 1 - \\exp(-\\alpha C F t) = 0.26 $$\nWe solve this equation for $\\alpha$.
