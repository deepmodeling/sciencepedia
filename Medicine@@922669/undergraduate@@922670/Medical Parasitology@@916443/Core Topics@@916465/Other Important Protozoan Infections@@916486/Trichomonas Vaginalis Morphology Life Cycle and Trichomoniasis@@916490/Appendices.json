This exercise bridges the gap between the parasite's biology and the mathematical models used to describe its proliferation [@problem_id:4817208].", "problem": "A laboratory is quantifying the in vitro growth kinetics of Trichomonas vaginalis, a flagellated protozoan parasite that reproduces by longitudinal binary fission and lacks a cyst stage.

Assume that during this interval the population grows exponentially with a constant specific growth rate.\n\nUsing only the foundational definitions of exponential growth, namely that population size follows $N(t) = N_{0} \\exp(r t)$ for constant specific growth rate $r$ and that the doubling time $T_{d}$ is defined by $N(t + T_{d}) = 2 N(t)$, first infer the axenic doubling time from the given observations. Then, consider xenic culture conditions (co-culture with nonpathogenic bacteria), under which well-controlled experiments have shown that the specific growth rate of Trichomonas vaginalis is $1.25$ times the axenic specific growth rate under otherwise identical conditions.\n\nWhat is the expected doubling time under xenic conditions? Express your final answer in hours and round your answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in microbiology, well-posed with sufficient data, and objectively stated.\n\nThe solution requires determining the doubling time of *Trichomonas vaginalis* under xenic conditions based on provided growth data from an axenic culture. This will be accomplished in three steps: 1) deriving the general relationship between the specific growth rate and doubling time from the exponential growth model, 2) calculating the specific growth rate and doubling time for the axenic culture, and 3) calculating the doubling time for the xenic culture.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the specific growth rate, $r$, and the doubling time, $T_d$. The population size, $N(t)$, at a given time $t$ is described by the exponential growth model:\n$$N(t) = N_0 \\exp(rt)$$\nwhere $N_0$ is the initial population size at $t=0$. The doubling time, $T_d$, is defined by the condition $N(t + T_d) = 2N(t)$. Applying the exponential growth model to this definition yields:\n$$N_0 \\exp(r(t + T_d)) = 2 \\cdot N_0 \\exp(rt)$$\nThe terms $N_0$ and $\\exp(rt)$ are non-zero and can be cancelled from both sides, leaving:\n$$\\exp(rT_d) = 2$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides of this equation isolates the product $rT_d$:\n$$rT_d = \\ln(2)$$\nThis provides a fundamental inverse relationship between the doubling time and the specific growth rate:\n$$T_d = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{r}$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the specific growth rate under axenic conditions, $r_{\\text{axenic}}$, using the provided experimental data. The initial parasite density is $N_{0, \\text{axenic}} = 1.2 \\times 10^5$ cells/mL, and it increases to a final density of $N_{\\text{axenic}}(t) = 7.68 \\times 10^6$ cells/mL over a time interval of $t = 48$ hours.\nWe rearrange the exponential growth equation to solve for $r_{\\text{axenic}}$:\n$$r_{\\text{axenic}} = \\frac{1}{t} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{\\text{axenic}}(t)}{N_{0, \\text{axenic}}}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the numerical values into this equation:\n$$r_{\\text{axenic}} = \\frac{1}{48 \\text{ h}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{7.68 \\times 10^6}{1.2 \\times 10^5}\\right)$$\nWe first compute the ratio of the final to initial densities:\n$$\\frac{7.68 \\times 10^6}{1.2 \\times 10^5} = \\frac{76.8}{1.2} = 64$$\nThe expression for $r_{\\text{axenic}}$ becomes:\n$$r_{\\text{axenic}} = \\frac{\\ln(64)}{48} \\text{ h}^{-1}$$\nRecognizing that $64 = 2^6$, we can simplify $\\ln(64) = \\ln(2^6) = 6\\ln(2)$.\n$$r_{\\text{axenic}} = \\frac{6\\ln(2)}{48} \\text{ h}^{-1} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{8} \\text{ h}^{-1}$$\nAs an intermediate step, we infer the axenic doubling time, $T_{d, \\text{axenic}}$, using the relationship derived earlier:\n$$T_{d, \\text{axenic}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{r_{\\text{axenic}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{8} \\text{ h}^{-1}} = 8 \\text{ h}$$\n\nThird, we proceed to find the doubling time under xenic conditions, $T_{d, \\text{xenic}}$. The problem states that the specific growth rate under xenic conditions, $r_{\\text{xenic}}$, is $1.25$ times the rate under axenic conditions:\n$$r_{\\text{xenic}} = 1.25 \\cdot r_{\\text{axenic}}$$\nThe xenic doubling time is given by:\n$$T_{d, \\text{xenic}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{r_{\\text{xenic}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{1.25 \\cdot r_{\\text{axenic}}}$$\nThis can be expressed in terms of the axenic doubling time:\n$$T_{d, \\text{xenic}} = \\frac{1}{1.25} \\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{r_{\\text{axenic}}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{1.25} T_{d, \\text{axenic}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated value $T_{d, \\text{axenic}} = 8$ hours:\n$$T_{d, \\text{xenic}} = \\frac{1}{1.25} \\cdot 8 \\text{ h}$$\nUsing the fractional equivalent of $1.25 = \\frac{5}{4}$:\n$$T_{d, \\text{xenic}} = \\frac{1}{5/4} \\cdot 8 \\text{ h} = \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot 8 \\text{ h} = \\frac{32}{5} \\text{ h} = 6.4 \\text{ h}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in hours and rounded to three significant figures.\n$$T_{d, \\text{xenic}} = 6.40 \\text{ h}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.40}$$", "id": "4817208"}, {"introduction": "Accurate diagnosis is the cornerstone of managing any infectious disease, and understanding the performance of different tests is crucial for clinical practice.

Trichomonas vaginalis exists only as a trophozoite, lacks a cyst stage, and rapidly loses motility outside the host. Wet mount microscopy therefore depends on immediate visualization of characteristic flagellated motility, which is further diminished in acidic conditions. Culture, by supporting trophozoite survival and multiplication, can detect lower initial organism burdens.\n\nTo estimate the sensitivity improvement when moving from wet mount to culture, the laboratory stratifies truly infected patients by vaginal pH into two biologically plausible subgroups reflecting trophozoite motility stability. The true infection status is established by a Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT), treated as the reference.\n\nAmong truly infected patients, a fraction $0.60$ have vaginal pH in a motility-favorable range (denote this stratum “high pH”), and a fraction $0.40$ have a motility-unfavorable range (“low pH”).
