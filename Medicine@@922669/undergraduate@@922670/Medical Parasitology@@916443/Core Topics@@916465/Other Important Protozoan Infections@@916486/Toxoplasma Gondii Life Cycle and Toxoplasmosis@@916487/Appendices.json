The distinction between the genera *Toxoplasma* (Family Sarcocystidae) and *Eimeria* (Family Eimeriidae) is based on well-established, fundamental morphological characteristics of the sporulated oocyst. The laboratory procedures mentioned (fecal concentration, sporulation in potassium dichromate) are standard and scientifically correct.\n- **Well-Posed**: The question is well-posed. It asks for a minimal but sufficient set of criteria to achieve a specific diagnostic goal (*Toxoplasma* vs. *Eimeria*) given a defined set of tools and constraints. This structure allows for a unique and correct answer based on established taxonomic principles.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and technical language common to the field of biology. It is free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Conclusion**: The problem is valid. It is a scientifically sound and well-posed question in the field of medical parasitology.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of Solution\nThe classification of apicomplexan parasites in the subclass Coccidia is fundamentally based on the morphology of the sporulated oocyst. The most critical and defining taxonomic feature at the family and genus level is the number of sporocysts within the oocyst and the number of sporozoites within each sporocyst.\n\n1.  ***Toxoplasma gondii***: This species belongs to the family Sarcocystidae. Within this family, genera such as *Toxoplasma*, *Neospora*, *Hammondia*, and *Cystoisospora* are characterized by oocysts that, upon sporulation, contain **two** sporocysts. For *Toxoplasma gondii* specifically, the sporulated oocyst contains $2$ sporocysts, and each sporocyst contains $4$ sporozoites. This is often represented as a ($2 \\times 4$) configuration. *T. gondii* oocysts are small, spherical to subspherical, typically $10$–$12 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$ in diameter, and lack a micropyle, polar granule, and oocyst residuum.\n\n2.  ***Eimeria*** **spp.**: This genus belongs to the family Eimeriidae. The defining characteristic of the vast majority of species in this family, and certainly for the genus *Eimeria*, is that the sporulated oocyst contains **four** sporocysts, and each sporocyst contains **two** sporozoites. This is a ($4 \\times 2$) configuration. The morphology of *Eimeria* oocysts is highly diverse across hundreds of species; they vary widely in size (from $\\sim 10 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$ to $> 50 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$), shape (spherical, ovoid, ellipsoidal), and presence of features like a micropyle, micropylar cap, or oocyst residuum.\n\nThe most robust, definitive, and minimal criterion to distinguish an oocyst of the genus *Toxoplasma* from an oocyst of the genus *Eimeria* is therefore the internal architecture of the sporulated oocyst. The problem explicitly states that sporulation is feasible, making this the ideal diagnostic strategy.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Measure only the oocyst diameter; classify any spherical oocyst with mean diameter $\\leq 12\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ as *Toxoplasma gondii* and any larger as *Eimeria*.**\nThis criterion is insufficient and unreliable. While *T. gondii* oocysts fit this description (spherical, $\\sim 10$–$12 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$), numerous species of *Eimeria* from various hosts (e.g., certain rodent or avian species) also produce small, spherical oocysts that fall within or very near this size range. For example, oocysts of *Eimeria mitis* from chickens are spherical and about $16 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$ in diameter, and oocysts of *Eimeria coecicola* from rabbits are subspherical with a size of $12.8$–$19.2 \\times 11.2$–$16.0 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$. Relying on size alone would lead to frequent misidentification.\n**Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**B. In unsporulated oocysts, count internal sporoblasts; two sporoblasts indicates *Toxoplasma gondii*, while four indicates *Eimeria*; do not perform sporulation.**\nThis option is logically flawed. An unsporulated oocyst, by definition, contains a single-celled sporont. Sporoblasts are formed during the process of sporulation. One cannot count sporoblasts in an unsporulated oocyst. Furthermore, the instruction \"do not perform sporulation\" directly contradicts the method of counting sporoblasts, which requires sporulation to have at least initiated. Even if interpreted as \"observing early sporulation,\" distinguishing *T. gondii* from other Sarcocystidae that also produce $2$ sporoblasts (e.g., *Hammondia*, *Neospora*) would not be possible on this basis alone.\n**Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**C. After sporulation, count the number of sporocysts per oocyst and the number of sporozoites per sporocyst; classify oocysts with $2$ sporocysts each containing $4$ sporozoites as *Toxoplasma gondii* and those with $4$ sporocysts each containing $2$ sporozoites as *Eimeria*; no additional measurements are required.**\nThis option describes the fundamental taxonomic difference between the families Sarcocystidae (represented here by *Toxoplasma*) and Eimeriidae (*Eimeria*). The ($2$ sporocysts $\\times$ $4$ sporozoites) structure is characteristic of *Toxoplasma*. The ($4$ sporocysts $\\times$ $2$ sporozoites) structure is characteristic of *Eimeria*. This criterion is both sufficient for a high-confidence distinction and minimal, as it relies on a single, definitive set of observations that define the genera, without needing other, less reliable metrics like size or wall features. The problem grants that sporulation is feasible, making this the correct and most rigorous approach.\n**Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**D. Rely on oocyst wall specializations: the presence of a micropyle and polar cap identifies *Eimeria*, whereas their absence identifies *Toxoplasma gondii*; do not require sporulation or size measurements.**\nThis criterion is unreliable. *Toxoplasma gondii* oocysts do indeed lack a micropyle. However, while many species of *Eimeria* (particularly in large animals like ruminants) have a conspicuous micropyle, many other *Eimeria* species (e.g., from birds and rodents) lack a micropyle entirely or have one that is not visible with bright-field microscopy. Therefore, the absence of a micropyle is not a definitive characteristic to rule out *Eimeria*. An oocyst lacking a micropyle could be either *Toxoplasma* or one of many *Eimeria* species.\n**Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**E. Use an acid-fast staining method: call strongly acid-fast oocysts *Toxoplasma gondii* and weakly acid-fast oocysts *Eimeria*; do not require sporulation or size measurements.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. Acid-fast staining (e.g., modified Ziehl-Neelsen) is a key technique for identifying oocysts of *Cryptosporidium* spp., which stain bright pink to red. Oocysts of *Cystoisospora belli* are also acid-fast. However, oocysts of *Toxoplasma gondii* and *Eimeria* spp. are generally considered **not** acid-fast; they typically stain blue or green with the counterstain. This method is inappropriate for differentiating *Toxoplasma* from *Eimeria*.\n**Verdict**: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4816076"}, {"introduction": "Understanding a parasite's life cycle is not just an academic exercise; it is the key to breaking the chain of transmission.

It is a well-defined applied mathematics problem grounded in established biological principles. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the General Model\n\nOur first step is to model the number of infective (sporulated) oocysts, $S(t)$, present in the litter box at a time $t$ within a single cleaning cycle of duration $T_c$. We define $t=0$ as the moment immediately after a cleaning, so the number of oocysts is zero.\n\nOocysts are shed at a constant rate $r$. An oocyst shed at time $\\tau$ (where $0 \\le \\tau < t$) becomes infective at time $\\tau + T_s$. For this oocyst to be counted as infective at time $t$, it must have been shed at a time $\\tau$ such that $\\tau + T_s \\le t$, which implies $\\tau \\le t - T_s$.\n\nThis condition means that infective oocysts can only be present if $t > T_s$.\n-   For $0 \\le t \\le T_s$: No oocyst has had sufficient time to sporulate. Thus, the number of infective oocysts is zero: $S(t) = 0$.\n-   For $T_s < t < T_c$: The infective oocysts are those that were shed in the time interval $[0, t-T_s]$. The duration of this interval is $(t-T_s)$. Given a constant shedding rate $r$, the total number of oocysts shed during this interval is $r(t-T_s)$.\n\nTherefore, the number of infective oocysts within one cleaning cycle is a piecewise function of time $t$:\n$$\nS(t) =\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{if } 0 \\le t \\le T_s \\\\\nr(t - T_s) & \\text{if } T_s < t < T_c\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe expected number of exposure events over one cycle, $E_{cycle}$, is given by the integral of $\\alpha S(t)$ over the cycle duration $T_c$:\n$$\nE_{cycle}(T_c) = \\alpha \\int_{0}^{T_c} S(t) \\, dt\n$$\nIf the cleaning interval $T_c$ is less than or equal to the sporulation time $T_s$, then $S(t)=0$ for the entire interval $[0, T_c)$, and thus $E_{cycle}(T_c) = 0$.\n\nIf $T_c > T_s$, we must evaluate the integral:\n$$\nE_{cycle}(T_c) = \\alpha \\left( \\int_{0}^{T_s} 0 \\, dt + \\int_{T_s}^{T_c} r(t - T_s) \\, dt \\right) = \\alpha r \\int_{T_s}^{T_c} (t - T_s) \\, dt\n$$\nEvaluating the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{T_s}^{T_c} (t - T_s) \\, dt = \\left[ \\frac{(t-T_s)^2}{2} \\right]_{T_s}^{T_c} = \\frac{(T_c - T_s)^2}{2} - \\frac{(T_s - T_s)^2}{2} = \\frac{(T_c - T_s)^2}{2}\n$$\nThus, for $T_c > T_s$, the exposure per cycle is:\n$$\nE_{cycle}(T_c) = \\frac{\\alpha r}{2} (T_c - T_s)^2\n$$\nTo find the expected weekly exposure, we calculate the average exposure rate over a cycle and multiply it by the total duration of a week, $T_{week} = 168$ hours. The average exposure rate is $\\frac{E_{cycle}(T_c)}{T_c}$.\n$$\nE_{week}(T_c) = T_{week} \\times \\frac{E_{cycle}(T_c)}{T_c}\n$$\n\n### Application to an Every-Other-Day (48-hour) Schedule\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the expected weekly exposure under a $48$-hour cleaning schedule ($T_{c2} = 48$ hours). We have $T_{c2} = 48 > T_s = 36$, so exposure will occur. The weekly exposure is:\n$$\nE_{week,2} = E_{week}(T_{c2}) = \\frac{T_{week}}{T_{c2}} E_{cycle}(T_{c2}) = \\frac{T_{week}}{T_{c2}} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha r}{2} (T_{c2} - T_s)^2 \\right)\n$$\nThis is the general expression for weekly exposure for the $48$-hour schedule.\n\n### Calculation of Exposure Increase\n\nWe now compare the weekly exposure for the two schedules.\n\n**Scenario 1: Daily Cleaning ($T_{c1} = 24$ hours)**\nThe cleaning interval is $T_{c1} = 24$ hours. The sporulation time is $T_s = 36$ hours. Since $T_{c1} < T_s$, all oocysts are removed before they can become infective. From our general formula, as $T_{c1} \\le T_s$, the exposure per cycle is $E_{cycle}(T_{c1}) = 0$.\nTherefore, the total expected weekly exposure is $E_{week,1} = 0$.\n\n**Scenario 2: Every-Other-Day Cleaning ($T_{c2} = 48$ hours)**\nWe use the derived expression for $E_{week,2}$ and substitute the given values:\n$r = 5.0 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ hr}^{-1}$\n$\\alpha = 2.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ (oocyst-hr)}^{-1}$\n$T_s = 36 \\text{ hr}$\n$T_{c2} = 48 \\text{ hr}$\n$T_{week} = 168 \\text{ hr}$\n$$\nE_{week,2} = \\frac{168}{48} \\left( \\frac{(2.0 \\times 10^{-10})(5.0 \\times 10^{6})}{2} (48 - 36)^2 \\right)\n$$\nFirst, calculate the terms inside the parenthesis:\n$$\n\\frac{(2.0 \\times 10^{-10})(5.0 \\times 10^{6})}{2} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{2} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\n$$\n(48 - 36)^2 = (12)^2 = 144\n$$\nNow, substitute these back into the expression for $E_{week,2}$:\n$$\nE_{week,2} = \\frac{168}{48} \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times 144\n$$\nRecognizing that $\\frac{168}{48} = 3.5$:\n$$\nE_{week,2} = 3.5 \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times 144 = 0.252\n$$\nThe expected weekly exposure for the $48$-hour schedule is $0.252$ events.\n\nThe increase in weekly exposure is the difference between the two scenarios:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{week} = E_{week,2} - E_{week,1} = 0.252 - 0 = 0.252\n$$\nThe result $0.252$ has three significant figures, as requested.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.252}\n$$", "id": "4816129"}, {"introduction": "In clinical medicine, diagnostic tests are powerful but rarely perfect, and interpreting their results requires careful quantitative reasoning.
