For the purpose of modeling early transmission, assume a constant contact process and ecological stability of Sarcoptes scabiei, so that the per-contact transmission probability, the average number of effective contacts per unit time, and the duration of infectiousness are time-invariant.

The concept of the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, and its derivation from fundamental parameters like transmission probability ($\\beta$), contact rate ($c$), and infectious duration ($D$) are cornerstones of compartmental modeling. The application to scabies, including the distinction between classic and the more severe crusted form, is medically and epidemiologically sound. The parameter values provided are plausible representations of these two distinct clinical scenarios, where crusted scabies is known to be associated with a much higher mite burden and thus much higher transmissibility.\n\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly stated and contains all necessary information.

It is a standard, well-posed problem in mathematical epidemiology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is developed in two parts as requested: first, the derivation of the analytical expression for $R_0$, and second, the computation of $R_0$ for the two specified scenarios.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the analytical expression for $R_0$**\n\nThe problem defines the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a single infectious individual in a completely susceptible population. It further states that this value can be calculated as the time integral of the instantaneous hazard of transmission over the entire duration of infectiousness.\n\nLet $H(t)$ be the instantaneous hazard rate of producing a new case at time $t$. According to the problem statement, this hazard is the product of the per-contact transmission probability, $\\beta$, and the rate of effective contacts, $c$.\n$$H(t) = \\beta \\cdot c$$\nThe problem specifies that $\\beta$ and $c$ are constant over time. Therefore, the hazard rate $H(t)$ is also a constant.\n\n$R_0$ is the total expected number of transmissions over the infectious period, which has a duration of $D$. This is found by integrating the hazard rate $H(t)$ from the beginning of the infectious period (time $t=0$) to the end (time $t=D$).\n$$R_0 = \\int_{0}^{D} H(t) \\, dt$$\nSubstituting the expression for $H(t)$:\n$$R_0 = \\int_{0}^{D} (\\beta c) \\, dt$$\nSince $\\beta$ and $c$ are constants, they can be factored out of the integral:\n$$R_0 = \\beta c \\int_{0}^{D} 1 \\, dt$$\nEvaluating the definite integral:\n$$\\int_{0}^{D} 1 \\, dt = [t]_{0}^{D} = D - 0 = D$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $R_0$ yields the final analytical expression:\n$$R_0 = \\beta c D$$\nThis expression is dimensionally consistent. The probability $\\beta$ is dimensionless. The contact rate $c$ has units of $[\\text{time}]^{-1}$ (e.g., days$^{-1}$), and the duration $D$ has units of $[\\text{time}]$ (e.g., days). The product $\\beta c D$ is therefore dimensionless, which is correct for a reproduction number representing a count of secondary cases.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of $R_0$ for two scenarios**\n\nNow, we will use the derived formula $R_0 = \\beta c D$ to compute the basic reproduction number for the two given scenarios.\n\n**Scenario A: Classic scabies**\nThe parameters are given as:\n- $\\beta_{\\mathrm{classic}} = 0.02$\n- $c_{\\mathrm{classic}} = 1.0 \\, \\text{day}^{-1}$\n- $D_{\\mathrm{classic}} = 30 \\, \\text{days}$\n\nThe basic reproduction number, $R_{0, \\mathrm{classic}}$, is calculated as:\n$$R_{0, \\mathrm{classic}} = (0.02) \\cdot (1.0) \\cdot (30)$$\n$$R_{0, \\mathrm{classic}} = 0.6$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $0.600$. This value being less than $1$ suggests that, under these specific conditions, a single case of classic scabies would not be expected to sustain an outbreak in the population.\n\n**Scenario B: Crusted scabies**\nThe parameters are given as:\n- $\\beta_{\\mathrm{crusted}} = 0.05$\n- $c_{\\mathrm{crusted}} = 2.0 \\, \\text{day}^{-1}$\n- $D_{\\mathrm{crusted}} = 60 \\, \\text{days}$\n\nThe basic reproduction number, $R_{0, \\mathrm{crusted}}$, is calculated as:\n$$R_{0, \\mathrm{crusted}} = (0.05) \\cdot (2.0) \\cdot (60)$$\n$$R_{0, \\mathrm{crusted}} = (0.10) \\cdot (60)$$\n$$R_{0, \\mathrm{crusted}} = 6.0$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $6.00$. This value being significantly greater than $1$ indicates a high potential for sustained transmission and a large-scale outbreak, which is consistent with the clinical understanding of crusted scabies in institutional settings.\n\nThe two computed values are $R_{0, \\mathrm{classic}} = 0.600$ and $R_{0, \\mathrm{crusted}} = 6.00$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.600 & 6.00\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4811169"}, {"introduction": "Accurate diagnosis is the critical first step in managing any infectious disease, both for the individual patient and for preventing community spread.

Confirmed scabies — Category A$2$ (mite visualized on dermoscopy): Correct. Dermoscopy demonstrated the “delta-wing” sign, which is accepted by IACS as visualization of the mite on the patient.\n- B. Confirmed scabies — Category A$1$ (mite, eggs, or feces visualized on light microscopy of skin samples): Incorrect. Light microscopy was negative; A$1$ is not met.\n- C. Clinical scabies — Category B$1$ (presence of scabies burrows): Incorrect. Although B$1$ is satisfied by observed burrows, the patient meets a higher category (A$2$), which must be used.\n- D. Suspected scabies — Category C$1$ (typical lesions in a typical distribution with one history feature): Incorrect. The presentation exceeds C$1$ because there are two history features and burrows, and most importantly A$2$ is met.\n- E. Not scabies, because negative microscopy excludes the diagnosis: Incorrect.
