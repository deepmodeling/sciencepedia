This practice bridges the gap between field entomology and epidemiology by calculating a key measure of transmission intensity, the Entomological Inoculation Rate ($\\mathrm{EIR}$).

The Entomological Inoculation Rate (EIR) is defined as the expected number of infectious bites received per person per unit time and is grounded in the idea that an infectious bite occurs when a bite is delivered by a sporozoite-positive mosquito. For a particular month in a coastal township, the observed values were $ \\mathrm{HBR} = 12 $ bites per person per month and $ \\mathrm{SR} = 0.04 $.

The relationship between them is a cornerstone of transmission modeling. The premises are scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides sufficient definitions and data to derive and compute the EIR. The objective is clear, and a unique solution is attainable.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased terminology.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, missing information, contradiction, infeasibility, or ambiguity. The request to derive the relationship from first principles is a valid exercise in applying fundamental probability theory to an epidemiological context. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be formulated.\n\nThe derivation of the Entomological Inoculation Rate (EIR) from first principles is as follows.\n\nLet $N$ be the random variable representing the total number of mosquito bites received by a single person in one month. The problem defines the Human Biting Rate (HBR) as the average number of bites per person per month. In the language of probability, this average is the expected value of $N$.\n$$\nE[N] = \\mathrm{HBR}\n$$\n\nLet us consider a single mosquito bite. We can define an indicator random variable, $I$, for this bite being infectious. $I = 1$ if the bite is infectious, and $I = 0$ if it is not. The Sporozoite Rate (SR) is defined as the proportion of host-seeking female mosquitoes that are infectious. Assuming that any given bite is from a randomly selected member of the host-seeking mosquito population, the probability that a single bite is infectious is equal to the Sporozoite Rate.\n$$\nP(I=1) = \\mathrm{SR}\n$$\nBy definition, the expected value of an indicator variable is the probability of the event it indicates.\n$$\nE[I] = 1 \\cdot P(I=1) + 0 \\cdot P(I=0) = P(I=1) = \\mathrm{SR}\n$$\n\nThe total number of infectious bites received by a person in one month, let's call this random variable $X$, is the sum of the indicator variables for each bite. If a person receives $N$ bites in total, then\n$$\nX = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} I_k\n$$\nwhere $I_k$ is the indicator variable for the $k$-th bite being infectious. We assume that the event of one bite being infectious is independent of another, so the variables $I_k$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with $E[I_k] = \\mathrm{SR}$.\n\nThe Entomological Inoculation Rate (EIR) is defined as the expected number of infectious bites per person per month, which is $E[X]$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{EIR} = E[X] = E\\left[\\sum_{k=1}^{N} I_k\\right]\n$$\nTo evaluate this expectation where the number of terms in the sum ($N$) is itself a random variable, we use the Law of Total Expectation, also known as Wald's identity. This states that $E[\\sum_{k=1}^{N} I_k] = E[N] \\cdot E[I_k]$, provided that $N$ has a finite expectation, the $I_k$ are i.i.d. with finite expectation, and the $I_k$ are independent of $N$. These are standard assumptions in this context.\n\nApplying this identity:\n$$\n\\mathrm{EIR} = E[N] \\cdot E[I_k]\n$$\nSubstituting the definitions of HBR and SR:\n$$\n\\mathrm{EIR} = \\mathrm{HBR} \\cdot \\mathrm{SR}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation from first principles.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for the monthly EIR using the provided data: $\\mathrm{HBR} = 12$ bites per person per month and $\\mathrm{SR} = 0.04$. The Sporozoite Rate is a dimensionless proportion.\n$$\n\\mathrm{EIR} = 12 \\times 0.04\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{EIR} = 0.48\n$$\nThe units of EIR are determined by the units of HBR, resulting in $0.48$ infectious bites per person per month.\n\nFinally, a brief interpretation of this magnitude is required. An EIR of $0.48$ infectious bites per person per month signifies a moderate level of malaria transmission. It implies that a typical person in this coastal township is expected to receive, on average, nearly half of one infectious bite each month. To express this in terms of frequency, we can calculate the average time it takes for a person to receive one infectious bite: $1 / \\mathrm{EIR} = 1 / 0.48 \\text{ months} = 1 / (48/100) \\text{ months} = 100/48 \\text{ months} = 25/12 \\text{ months} \\approx 2.08$ months. Thus, a typical individual in this epidemiological setting is exposed to one infectious mosquito bite approximately every two months. This sustained rate of exposure is sufficient to maintain malaria endemicity within the population.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.48}\n$$", "id": "4801914"}, {"introduction": "Beyond measuring current exposure, we can build models to predict whether an outbreak will grow or decline.

Assume the dynamics are well described by the classical Ross–Macdonald framework for vector-borne transmission. Let the following parameters be defined as standard in this framework: the ratio of female mosquitoes to humans is $m$, the per-mosquito human biting rate is $a$ per day, the probability that a bite from an infectious mosquito infects a human is $b$, the probability that a bite on an infectious human infects a mosquito is $c$, the instantaneous mosquito mortality rate is $\\mu$ per day, the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) in the mosquito is $n$ days, and the human recovery rate is $r$ per day.

All parameters are clearly defined and consistent with established epidemiological models. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe basic reproduction number, $R_{0}$, is defined as the expected number of secondary human infections arising from a single primary infectious human in a completely susceptible population. To derive its expression, we trace the full transmission cycle from an infected human to new human cases. This cycle can be decomposed into two stages: the number of mosquitoes infected by one human, and the number of humans infected by one infected mosquito.\n\nStage 1: Transmission from Human to Mosquito\nLet us consider a single infectious human introduced into the population.\nThe average duration of infectiousness for a human is given by the inverse of the recovery rate, $r$. Thus, the mean infectious period is $1/r$ days.\nThe ratio of female mosquitoes to humans is $m$. A single human is therefore in proximity to, on average, $m$ mosquitoes.\nEach mosquito bites humans at a rate of $a$ bites per day. Therefore, a single human is bitten at a total rate of $m \\times a$ bites per day.\nThe probability that a bite on an infectious human successfully infects a susceptible mosquito is $c$.\nThe rate at which a single infectious human generates newly infected mosquitoes is the product of the biting rate on that human and the probability of transmission per bite: $m \\times a \\times c$.\nThe total expected number of mosquitoes infected by one human over their entire infectious period is this rate multiplied by the duration of the infectious period. Let this quantity be $N_{H \\to M}$:\n$$N_{H \\to M} = (m a c) \\times \\frac{1}{r} = \\frac{mac}{r}$$\n\nStage 2: Transmission from Mosquito to Human\nNow, consider a single mosquito that has just become infected. It is not immediately infectious.\nThe pathogen must undergo an extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of duration $n$ days within the mosquito.\nThe mosquito faces a constant instantaneous mortality rate of $\\mu$. The probability that a mosquito survives this EIP of length $n$ is given by $P(\\text{survive EIP}) = \\exp(-\\mu n)$.\nIf the mosquito survives the EIP, it becomes infectious and remains so for the rest of its life. Due to the assumption of a constant mortality rate (a memoryless process), the expected remaining lifespan of an infectious mosquito is $1/\\mu$ days.\nDuring its infectious lifespan, the mosquito bites humans at a rate of $a$ per day.\nThe probability that a bite from an infectious mosquito transmits the pathogen to a susceptible human is $b$.\nTherefore, the expected number of humans infected by a single mosquito, *conditional on it having survived the EIP to become infectious*, is the product of its biting rate, the transmission probability per bite, and its expected infectious lifespan: $a \\times b \\times (1/\\mu) = \\frac{ab}{\\mu}$.\nTo find the total expected number of secondary human infections from a single *newly infected* mosquito, we must multiply this by the probability that the mosquito survives the EIP. Let this quantity be $N_{M \\to H}$:\n$$N_{M \\to H} = P(\\text{survive EIP}) \\times (\\text{expected infections given infectious}) = \\exp(-\\mu n) \\times \\frac{ab}{\\mu}$$\n\nCombining the Stages to Find $R_{0}$\nThe basic reproduction number, $R_{0}$, is the product of the number of mosquitoes the primary human case infects ($N_{H \\to M}$) and the expected number of new human cases each of those infected mosquitoes will generate ($N_{M \\to H}$).\n$$R_{0} = N_{H \\to M} \\times N_{M \\to H}$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$R_{0} = \\left( \\frac{mac}{r} \\right) \\left( \\frac{ab}{\\mu} \\exp(-\\mu n) \\right)$$\nThis simplifies to the final closed-form expression for the basic reproduction number:\n$$R_{0} = \\frac{m a^{2} b c}{r \\mu} \\exp(-\\mu n)$$\n\nNumerical Evaluation\nWe are given the following parameter values for dengue:\n$m = 2$\n$a = 0.4$ day$^{-1}$\n$b = 0.6$\n$c = 0.6$\n$\\mu = 0.12$ day$^{-1}$\n$n = 8$ days\nThe human infectious period is $1/r = 5$ days, which implies a recovery rate $r = 1/5 = 0.2$ day$^{-1}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $R_{0}$:\n$$R_{0} = \\frac{(2)(0.4)^{2}(0.6)(0.6)}{(0.2)(0.12)} \\exp(-(0.12)(8))$$\nFirst, calculate the pre-exponential factor:\n$$\\frac{m a^{2}b c}{r \\mu} = \\frac{(2)(0.16)(0.36)}{0.024} = \\frac{0.1152}{0.024} = 4.8$$\nNext, calculate the exponential term, which represents the probability of a mosquito surviving the EIP:\n$$\\exp(-\\mu n) = \\exp(-(0.12)(8)) = \\exp(-0.96)$$\nUsing a calculator, $\\exp(-0.96) \\approx 0.38289$.\nNow, multiply the two parts:\n$$R_{0} = 4.8 \\times \\exp(-0.96) \\approx 4.8 \\times 0.38289 \\approx 1.83788$$\nRounding the numerical answer to three significant figures gives $1.84$.\n\nInterpretation of the Result\nThe basic reproduction number, $R_{0}$, is approximately $1.84$. Since $R_0 > 1$, each infectious individual, on average, gives rise to more than one new infection in a fully susceptible population. This indicates that the conditions are favorable for disease transmission, and the outbreak would be expected to grow or expand.

Elasticity with respect to daily survival, $\\epsilon_{p}$**\n\nThe elasticity $\\epsilon_{p}$ is defined as $\\frac{\\partial \\ln R_{0}}{\\partial \\ln p}$. We differentiate with respect to $\\ln(p)$. Let $u = \\ln(p)$. The terms involving $p$ are $n\\ln(p)$ and $-\\ln(-\\ln(p))$, which become $nu$ and $-\\ln(-u)$.\n$$ \\epsilon_{p} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln p} \\left[ n\\ln(p) - \\ln(-\\ln(p)) \\right] = \\frac{d}{du} \\left[ nu - \\ln(-u) \\right] $$\nUsing the chain rule for the second term:\n$$ \\epsilon_{p} = n - \\frac{1}{-u} \\cdot \\frac{d(-u)}{du} = n - \\frac{1}{-u} \\cdot (-1) = n - \\frac{1}{u} $$\nSubstituting $u = \\ln(p)$ back into the expression:\n$$ \\epsilon_{p} = n - \\frac{1}{\\ln(p)} $$\n\n**3. Elasticity with respect to extrinsic incubation period, $\\epsilon_{n}$**\n\nThe elasticity $\\epsilon_{n}$ is defined as $\\frac{\\partial \\ln R_{0}}{\\partial \\ln n}$. The variable $n$ does not appear inside a logarithm in the expression for $\\ln(R_0)$. We must use the chain rule: $\\epsilon_{n} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln R_{0}}{\\partial n} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\ln n}$.\nFirst, we find the partial derivative of $\\ln(R_0)$ with respect to $n$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\ln R_{0}}{\\partial n} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n} \\left[ \\ln(K) + 2\\ln(a) + n\\ln(p) - \\ln(-\\ln(p)) \\right] = \\ln(p) $$\nNext, we find $\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\ln n}$. Let $y = \\ln(n)$, which implies $n = \\exp(y)$. Then $\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial y} = \\exp(y) = n$.\nCombining these results:\n$$ \\epsilon_{n} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\ln R_{0}}{\\partial n} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\ln n} \\right) = (\\ln(p)) \\cdot (n) $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{n} = n \\ln(p) $$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation and Justification\n\nWe are given the baseline values $p = 0.9$ and $n = 10$.

To determine which parameter is the most influential control lever, we must compare the magnitudes (absolute values) of their respective elasticities. A larger magnitude implies a greater proportional impact on $R_0$.\nThe magnitudes are:\n-   $|\\epsilon_{a}| = |2.000| = 2.000$\n-   $|\\epsilon_{p}| = |19.49| = 19.49$\n-   $|\\epsilon_{n}| = |-1.054| = 1.054$\n\nComparing these values, $|\\epsilon_{p}|$ is the largest by a significant margin. Specifically, $19.49 > 2.000 > 1.054$.\nThis means that, at the specified baseline parameter values, a small percentage change in the daily survival probability of mosquitoes, $p$, has a much larger percentage impact on the basic reproduction number $R_0$ than an equivalent percentage change in either the biting rate $a$ or the extrinsic incubation period $n$. For instance, a $1\\%$ increase in $p$ would lead to an approximate $19.49\\%$ increase in $R_0$. This high sensitivity makes the mosquito daily survival probability, $p$, the most influential control lever among the three parameters considered. Interventions that reduce mosquito lifespan (i.e., decrease $p$) are therefore predicted to be highly effective at reducing disease transmission.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2.000 & 19.49 & -1.054 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4801954"}]}
