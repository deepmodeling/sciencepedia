Using the following fundamental base, construct an estimator for reservoir competence and quantify it for two sympatric small mammals, Peromyscus leucopus and Tamias striatus, using xenodiagnosis:\n\n- Reservoir competence of a host species is the probability that a larval Ixodes scapularis tick becomes infected after feeding on a randomly encountered individual of that host species. Under the standard epidemiological decomposition, this equals the product of the host infection prevalence and the conditional probability that a larva acquires infection given that the host is infected.\n- In Ixodes scapularis and Borrelia burgdorferi, transovarial transmission is negligible, so xenodiagnostic larvae are effectively uninfected prior to feeding.\n- The maximum likelihood estimator for a binomial probability under independent trials is the observed number of successes divided by the number of trials.\n\nField study and xenodiagnosis data:\n\n- Peromyscus leucopus: Of $40$ captured individuals, $30$ tested positive for Borrelia burgdorferi infection by ear biopsy culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Xenodiagnosis on the $30$ infected individuals used naive laboratory-reared Ixodes scapularis larvae; across all infected hosts combined, $600$ larvae fed to repletion and were subsequently tested by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), of which $300$ were positive for Borrelia burgdorferi.\n- Tamias striatus: Of $30$ captured individuals, $9$ tested positive by the same diagnostic scheme. Xenodiagnosis on the $9$ infected chipmunks involved $450$ larvae fed in total, of which $45$ later tested positive by qPCR.\n\nAssume that within each host species, larval infection outcomes are independent given host infection status and share a common per-tick transmission probability when feeding on infected hosts.
