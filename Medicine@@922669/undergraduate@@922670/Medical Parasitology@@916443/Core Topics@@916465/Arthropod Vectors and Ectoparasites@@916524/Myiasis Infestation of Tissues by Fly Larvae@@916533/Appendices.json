Let the lesion diameter be denoted by $D(t)$ in millimeters, where $t$ is time in days. A foundational modeling assumption in biomedical kinetics is that a rate of change can be proportional to a driving factor; here, enzyme-mediated tissue degradation suggests that the rate of change of lesion diameter is proportional to the local enzyme activity. Thus, the rate of change of diameter is modeled as proportional to the enzyme activity $E(t)$, with proportionality constant $k$ that carries the units needed to yield a rate of diameter change. In a clinical measurement, the enzyme activity is approximately constant over the next $1$ day at $E = 3$ units of enzyme activity, where one unit (U) is defined by a standard biochemical assay.

Thus, we can substitute $T_{t} = T$ into the equation:\n$$DD(n)=\\sum_{t=1}^{n}\\max\\{0,\\,T-T_{0}\\}$$\nWe are also given the condition that $T  T_{0}$. This implies that the difference $T-T_{0}$ is a positive value. Consequently, the maximum of $0$ and $T-T_{0}$ is simply $T-T_{0}$:\n$$\\max\\{0,\\,T-T_{0}\\} = T-T_{0}$$\nSubstituting this back into the summation, we get:\n$$DD(n)=\\sum_{t=1}^{n}(T-T_{0})$$\nThe term $(T-T_{0})$ is a constant with respect to the summation index $t$. The sum of a constant term over $n$ iterations is equal to $n$ times the constant term. Therefore, the expression for accumulated degree-days simplifies to:\n$$DD(n) = n(T-T_{0})$$\nPupation is defined to occur at the time $t^{*}$ when the accumulated degree-days, $DD(t^{*})$, reach the species-specific threshold, $DD^{*}$. We set $n=t^{*}$ and $DD(t^{*})=DD^{*}$ in our simplified equation:\n$$DD^{*} = t^{*}(T-T_{0})$$\nTo find the expression for the time to pupation, $t^{*}$, we rearrange this equation. Since we know $T  T_{0}$, the term $(T-T_{0})$ is non-zero, and we can legally divide by it:\n$$t^{*} = \\frac{DD^{*}}{T-T_{0}}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the expected time to pupation.\n\nNext, we must compute the numerical value of $t^{*}$ for the specific case provided. The given parameters are:\n- $DD^{*} = 180$ degree-days\n- $T = 25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n- $T_{0} = 10^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived formula:\n$$t^{*} = \\frac{180}{25 - 10}$$\nFirst, we evaluate the denominator:\n$$25 - 10 = 15$$\nNow we perform the division:\n$$t^{*} = \\frac{180}{15}$$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can note that $180 = 12 \\times 15$.\n$$t^{*} = 12$$\nThe expected time to pupation is $12$ days.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12}$$", "id": "4802285"}, {"introduction": "Accurate species identification is critical for appropriate clinical management and epidemiological tracking of myiasis.
