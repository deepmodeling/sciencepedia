Assume a single infectious rat introduces Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis) into a fully susceptible rat population and flea population. Under the standard Ross–Macdonald assumptions for vector-borne transmission, the flea population is characterized by a constant per-day mortality hazard, the rat infectious period ends by recovery at a constant rate, and transmission at each bite is independent across events.\n\nStart from the following foundational elements:\n- The basic reproductive number $R_0$ is the expected number of new infectious hosts generated by a single infectious host introduced into a fully susceptible host and vector system.\n- Vectors (fleas) bite hosts at a mean rate $a$ bites per flea per day, hosts carry on average $m$ fleas, and an infectious host remains infectious for an average duration of $1/r$ days (with $r$ the host recovery rate per day).\n- The probability that an infectious host infects a biting flea is $c$ per bite, and the probability that an infectious flea infects a host is $b$ per bite.\n- Flea mortality follows an exponential (memoryless) process with constant daily hazard $\\mu$, and the daily survival probability is $p$. The extrinsic incubation period (the time from flea infection to flea infectiousness) is $n$ days.\n\nTask:\n1.

The parameters ($a, m, b, c, r, p, n$) are standard in this field. The context of *Yersinia pestis* transmission via fleas and rats is a classic and well-studied example. The assumption of exponential (memoryless) processes for flea mortality and host recovery is a standard simplification for creating tractable analytical models. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed:** All necessary parameters for deriving and calculating $R_0$ are provided. The task is clearly defined. An implicit relationship between the daily survival probability $p$ and the daily mortality hazard $\\mu$ ($p = \\exp(-\\mu)$) is a standard feature of the exponential model and does not represent a contradiction or lack of information. A unique, meaningful solution exists.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased technical language.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Expression for $R_0$ (Task 1)\n\nThe basic reproductive number, $R_0$, is the expected number of secondary host infections produced by a single primary infectious host in an otherwise entirely susceptible population. We can derive its expression by sequentially tracing the transmission cycle from one infected host to the next generation of infected hosts.\n\n1.  **Number of fleas infected by a single host:**\n    A single infectious host is, on average, infectious for a duration of $1/r$ days. This host carries an average of $m$ fleas. These fleas bite the host at a rate of $a$ bites per flea per day. Thus, the total rate of flea bites on this single host is $m \\times a$ bites per day. The probability that any given bite from a susceptible flea on this infectious host results in the flea becoming infected is $c$.\n    The rate at which new fleas are infected by this single host is the product of these terms: $m \\times a \\times c$ infected fleas per day.\n    The total number of fleas that become infected over the entire infectious period of the host is the rate of infection multiplied by the duration of infectiousness:\n    $$N_{\\text{infected fleas}} = (m \\cdot a \\cdot c) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right) = \\frac{mac}{r}$$\n\n2.  **Number of infected fleas that become infectious:**\n    A flea that acquires the pathogen is not immediately able to transmit it. It must first survive the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of $n$ days. The probability that a flea survives a single day is $p$. Assuming daily survival is an independent event (consistent with the memoryless exponential mortality process), the probability that a flea survives for $n$ consecutive days is $p^n$.\n    Therefore, the total number of fleas produced by the primary host that successfully become infectious is the number of initially infected fleas multiplied by the probability of surviving the EIP:\n    $$N_{\\text{infectious fleas}} = N_{\\text{infected fleas}} \\times p^n = \\frac{macp^n}{r}$$\n\n3.  **Number of new hosts infected by a single infectious flea:**\n    Once a flea becomes infectious, it remains so for the rest of its life. An infectious flea bites susceptible hosts at a rate of $a$ bites per day. The probability of transmitting the infection to a host at each bite is $b$. Thus, the rate at which a single infectious flea infects new hosts is $a \\times b$ infections per day.\n    The expected duration that this flea will live (and remain infectious) must be calculated. The problem states that flea mortality is a memoryless exponential process with a constant daily hazard $\\mu$. The daily survival probability is $p$. These are related by $p = \\exp(-\\mu)$. From this, the mortality hazard can be expressed in terms of the survival probability: $\\mu = -\\ln(p)$.\n    For a memoryless process, the expected future lifetime is constant, regardless of the age of the individual. Therefore, the expected lifespan of a newly infectious flea is $1/\\mu$.\n    The total number of new hosts infected by a single infectious flea over its entire remaining lifetime is the rate of infection multiplied by the expected infectious lifespan:\n    $$N_{\\text{new hosts per infectious flea}} = (a \\cdot b) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu}\\right) = \\frac{ab}{-\\ln(p)}$$\n\n4.  **Combining the steps to derive $R_0$:**\n    $R_0$ is the total number of secondary host infections generated by the initial primary host. This is found by multiplying the number of infectious fleas produced by the primary host by the expected number of new hosts infected per infectious flea.\n    $$R_0 = (N_{\\text{infectious fleas}}) \\times (N_{\\text{new hosts per infectious flea}})$$\n    $$R_0 = \\left( \\frac{macp^n}{r} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{ab}{-\\ln(p)} \\right)$$\n    Combining terms gives the final analytical expression for $R_0$:\n    $$R_0 = \\frac{ma^2bcp^n}{r(-\\ln(p))}$$\n\n### Numerical Calculation of $R_0$ (Task 2)\n\nWe are given the following parameter values: $m = 12$, $a = 0.4$, $b = 0.2$, $c = 0.5$, $p = 0.85$, $n = 6$, and $r = 0.25$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $R_0$:\n$$R_0 = \\frac{(12)(0.4)^2(0.2)(0.5)(0.85)^6}{(0.25)(-\\ln(0.85))}$$\nFirst, we evaluate the components of the expression:\n-   $a^2 = (0.4)^2 = 0.16$\n-   $p^n = (0.85)^6 \\approx 0.3771495156$\n-   $-\\ln(p) = -\\ln(0.85) \\approx -(-0.1625189295) \\approx 0.1625189295$\n\nNow, we substitute these intermediate results back into the equation for $R_0$:\n$$R_0 = \\frac{(12)(0.16)(0.2)(0.5)(0.3771495156)}{(0.25)(0.1625189295)}$$\nCalculate the numerator:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = 12 \\times 0.16 \\times 0.2 \\times 0.5 \\times 0.3771495156 = 0.192 \\times 0.3771495156 \\approx 0.072412707 $$\nCalculate the denominator:\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = 0.25 \\times 0.1625189295 \\approx 0.040629732 $$\nFinally, compute the ratio:\n$$ R_0 = \\frac{0.072412707}{0.040629732} \\approx 1.7821600 $$\nRounding the final result to four significant figures gives $R_0 \\approx 1.782$.\n\n### Assessment of Transmission Feasibility (Task 3)\n\nThe basic reproductive number, $R_0$, is the threshold quantity for determining whether an epidemic can occur in a susceptible population.\n-   If $R_0 > 1$, each infectious individual, on average, causes more than one new infection. This leads to exponential growth in the number of cases (in the early phase), and sustained transmission is possible. An epidemic is likely.\n-   If $R_0 \\leq 1$, each infectious individual, on average, causes one or fewer new infections. The chain of transmission cannot sustain itself, and the outbreak will die out.\n\nIn this scenario, the calculated value is $R_0 \\approx 1.782$. Since $R_0 > 1$, the conditions are sufficient for the pathogen to invade the host and vector populations. Each infectious rat is expected to lead to approximately $1.782$ new infectious rats. Therefore, based on this result, sustained transmission of *Yersinia pestis* is feasible in this setting, and the system has epidemic potential.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.782}$$", "id": "4789337"}, {"introduction": "Building on a firm understanding of $R_0$, we can now use it as a powerful tool to evaluate public health interventions.

Use the following foundational definitions. The basic reproduction number ($R_0$) is the expected number of new host infections caused by a single infectious host introduced into a fully susceptible host population. A single flea attempts blood meals on hosts at a rate $a$ (successful bites per flea per day on the target host species). There are $m$ fleas per host. When a flea feeds on an infectious host, the probability per bite that the flea becomes infected is $c$. Infected fleas must complete an extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of duration $\\tau$ days before becoming infectious to hosts. Fleas die at a per-capita rate $\\mu$ (per day), so the probability that a flea survives the EIP is $\\exp(-\\mu \\tau)$. After the EIP, an infectious flea bites hosts at rate $a$ and transmits infection to a susceptible host with probability $b$ per bite. Fleas remain infectious until death; the mean infectious duration of a flea is $1/\\mu$. Hosts recover at per-capita rate $r$ (per day), so the mean infectious duration of a host is $1/r$.\n\nA host-targeted intervention consisting of a systemic insecticide administered to pets reduces the fraction of successful flea blood meals by $p$, resulting in a reduced effective biting rate $a' = (1 - p)a$ on the treated host species.

The transmission cycle is `Host -> Flea -> Host`. We can derive $R_0$ by tracking the number of infections generated over one full cycle.\n\n    *   **Step 1: Host-to-flea transmission.**\n        Consider a single infectious host introduced into a susceptible population.\n        *   The average duration of infectiousness for a host is $1/r$ days.\n        *   There are $m$ fleas associated with this host.

It must survive the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of duration $\\tau$. The probability of a flea surviving this period is given as $\\exp(-\\mu \\tau)$.\n        *   After surviving the EIP, the flea becomes infectious and remains so for the rest of its life.

The last term is $a_N = 0.8N - 3$.\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is given by $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(\\text{first term} + \\text{last term})$.\n$$DD(N) = \\frac{N-5}{2} (1.8 + (0.8N - 3))$$\n$$DD(N) = \\frac{N-5}{2} (0.8N - 1.2)$$\n$$DD(N) = (N-5)(0.4N - 0.6)$$\n$$DD(N) = 0.4N^2 - 0.6N - 2N + 3$$\n$$DD(N) = 0.4N^2 - 2.6N + 3$$\nWe must now find the smallest integer $N$ (where $N \\geq 6$) for which $DD(N) \\geq K$.\n$$0.4N^2 - 2.6N + 3 \\geq 168$$\n$$0.4N^2 - 2.6N - 165 \\geq 0$$\nTo find the values of $N$ for which this inequality holds, we first find the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation $0.4N^2 - 2.6N - 165 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, $N = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=0.4$, $b=-2.6$, and $c=-165$:\n$$N = \\frac{-(-2.6) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2.6)^2 - 4(0.4)(-165)}}{2(0.4)}$$\n$$N = \\frac{2.6 \\pm \\sqrt{6.76 + 1.6(165)}}{0.8}$$\n$$N = \\frac{2.6 \\pm \\sqrt{6.76 + 264}}{0.8}$$\n$$N = \\frac{2.6 \\pm \\sqrt{270.76}}{0.8}$$\nThe value of the square root is $\\sqrt{270.76} \\approx 16.45$.\nSince $N$ represents days and must be positive, we take the positive root:\n$$N \\approx \\frac{2.6 + 16.45}{0.8} = \\frac{19.05}{0.8} \\approx 23.81$$\nThe quadratic function $f(N) = 0.4N^2 - 2.6N - 165$ is an upward-opening parabola, so the inequality $f(N) \\geq 0$ holds for $N$ greater than or equal to the positive root. Thus, we need $N \\geq 23.81$.\nThe problem asks for the earliest integer day $N$ that satisfies this condition. The smallest integer greater than or equal to $23.81$ is $24$. So, $N=24$.\n\nTo verify, we can compute $DD(N)$ for $N=23$ and $N=24$ using the derived formula $DD(N) = 0.4N^2 - 2.6N + 3$:\nFor $N=23$:\n$$DD(23) = 0.4(23)^2 - 2.6(23) + 3 = 0.4(529) - 59.8 + 3 = 211.6 - 59.8 + 3 = 151.8 + 3 = 154.8$$\nSince $154.8 < 168$, the cohort has not completed development by the end of day $23$.\n\nFor $N=24$:\n$$DD(24) = 0.4(24)^2 - 2.6(24) + 3 = 0.4(576) - 62.4 + 3 = 230.4 - 62.4 + 3 = 168 + 3 = 171$$\nSince $171 \\geq 168$, the cumulative degree-day requirement is first met on day $24$. Emergence occurs on this day.\n\nThe ecological implication of this result is that the timing of vector emergence is not solely dependent on temperature reaching a certain level. Other environmental constraints, such as humidity, can act as a critical gate, delaying a population's development. In this case, although temperatures were favorable from day $4$ onwards, the lack of sufficient humidity postponed the start of development until day $6$. This creates a lag between the initial onset of warm conditions and the appearance of the new generation of adult fleas, which has significant consequences for predicting the timing of disease transmission risk. Modeling these interacting factors is crucial for accurate public health forecasting for vector-borne diseases.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{24}$$", "id": "4789303"}]}
