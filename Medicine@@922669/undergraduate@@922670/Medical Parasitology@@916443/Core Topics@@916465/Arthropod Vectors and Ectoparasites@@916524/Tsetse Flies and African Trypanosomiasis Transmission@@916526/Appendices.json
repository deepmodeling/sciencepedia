The solution involves three primary steps: deriving the expression for $n$ as a function of temperature ($T$), calculating the ratio of vectorial capacities at two different temperatures, and computing the final numerical result.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the extrinsic incubation period, $n$, and the ambient temperature, $T$, based on the provided degree-day model. The model states that parasite development requires the accumulation of a fixed heat sum, $K$, in degree-days, above a minimum developmental threshold temperature, $T_{\\min}$. For a constant ambient temperature $T$, the number of degree-days accumulated per day is the surplus temperature, $(T - T_{\\min})$. This accumulation is assumed to happen only if $T  T_{\\min}$. The total heat sum accumulated over $n$ days is the product of the daily accumulation and the number of days. This leads to the equation:\n$$\nn \\cdot (T - T_{\\min}) = K\n$$\nSolving for $n$ as a function of $T$ yields the expression for the extrinsic incubation period:\n$$\nn(T) = \\frac{K}{T - T_{\\min}}\n$$\nThis expression is valid for $T  T_{\\min}$. If $T \\le T_{\\min}$, development does not proceed, and $n$ would be infinite. The inverse relationship shows that as temperature increases, the time required for parasite development decreases.\n\nSecond, we determine how this temperature-dependent EIP affects the vectorial capacity, $C$. The problem provides the Macdonald formulation for $C$:\n$$\nC = \\frac{m\\,a^{2}\\,p^{n}}{-\\ln(p)}\n$$\nwhere $m$ is the number of vectors per host, $a$ is the daily biting rate, and $p$ is the daily survival probability of the vector. The problem specifies that $m$, $a$, and $p$ are constant across the temperatures being compared. The temperature dependence of $C$ therefore arises exclusively from $n(T)$. We can write $C$ as a function of $T$:\n$$\nC(T) = \\frac{m\\,a^{2}\\,p^{n(T)}}{-\\ln(p)}\n$$\nWe need to compute the ratio $R = \\frac{C(T_2)}{C(T_1)}$ for two temperatures, $T_1$ and $T_2$.
