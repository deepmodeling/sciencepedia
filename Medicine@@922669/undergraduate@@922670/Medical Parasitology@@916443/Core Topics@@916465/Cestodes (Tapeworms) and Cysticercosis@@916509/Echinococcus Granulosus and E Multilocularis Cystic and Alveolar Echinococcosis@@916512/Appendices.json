Let the cumulative annual egg deposition density on frequently contacted soil be $D$ eggs per square meter per year. Each person’s annual cumulative hand-to-soil contact area is $A$ square meters. Conditional on contacting an area with $x$ eggs per square meter, assume an effective ingestion probability per contact $p$ that represents the fraction of eggs present on the contacted area that are transferred and ingested. Assume the Independent Action Hypothesis (IAH), under which each ingested egg acts independently to establish infection with species-specific per-egg establishment probabilities. Let $f_{\\text{g}}$ be the fraction of environmental eggs from Echinococcus granulosus and $f_{\\text{m}} = 1 - f_{\\text{g}}$ the fraction from Echinococcus multilocularis.

This value represents the mean of the distribution of ingested eggs. It is the product of the egg density on the soil, the area of contact, and the probability of transfer and ingestion.\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{total}} = D \\times A \\times p\n$$\n\nThe units of this product are $(\\text{eggs} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-2} \\cdot \\text{year}^{-1}) \\times (\\text{m}^{2} \\cdot \\text{person}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{year}^{-1}) \\times (\\text{dimensionless})$, which results in eggs per person per year. This confirms dimensional consistency.\n\nThe expected number of ingested eggs is composed of eggs from the two species. We can calculate the species-specific expected number of ingested eggs, $\\lambda_{\\text{g}}$ and $\\lambda_{\\text{m}}$, by multiplying the total by the respective fractions:\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{g}} = \\lambda_{\\text{total}} \\times f_{\\text{g}} = (D \\times A \\times p) \\times f_{\\text{g}}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{m}} = \\lambda_{\\text{total}} \\times f_{\\text{m}} = (D \\times A \\times p) \\times f_{\\text{m}}\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the number of ingested eggs can be modeled as a random event. For rare events occurring over a large number of trials (contacts), the Poisson distribution is appropriate. We model the number of ingested eggs of species $i$ (where $i$ is $g$ or $m$), $K_i$, as a Poisson random variable with mean $\\lambda_i$: $K_i \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_i)$.\n\nThe Independent Action Hypothesis (IAH) posits that each ingested egg has an independent probability, $\\alpha_i$, of causing an infection. The probability that a single egg of species $i$ does *not* cause an infection is $(1 - \\alpha_i)$.\n\nThe probability of having no infection from species $i$, $P(\\text{NoInf}_{i})$, can be found by considering all possible numbers of ingested eggs, $k$. Using the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(\\text{NoInf}_{i}) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} P(\\text{NoInf}_{i} | K_i=k) \\cdot P(K_i=k)\n$$\nGiven that $k$ eggs are ingested, the probability of no infection is $(1-\\alpha_i)^k$, due to independence. The probability of ingesting $k$ eggs is given by the Poisson distribution, $P(K_i=k) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda_i) \\lambda_i^k}{k!}$.\nSubstituting these into the sum:\n$$\nP(\\text{NoInf}_{i}) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (1-\\alpha_i)^k \\cdot \\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda_i) \\lambda_i^k}{k!}\n$$\n$$\nP(\\text{NoInf}_{i}) = \\exp(-\\lambda_i) \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\lambda_i(1-\\alpha_i))^k}{k!}\n$$\nThe sum is the Taylor series for the exponential function, $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^k}{k!} = \\exp(x)$, with $x = \\lambda_i(1-\\alpha_i)$.\n$$\nP(\\text{NoInf}_{i}) = \\exp(-\\lambda_i) \\cdot \\exp(\\lambda_i(1-\\alpha_i)) = \\exp(-\\lambda_i + \\lambda_i - \\lambda_i\\alpha_i) = \\exp(-\\lambda_i\\alpha_i)\n$$\nThis is a standard result from quantitative microbial risk assessment, known as the exponential dose-response model. The term $\\lambda_i\\alpha_i$ represents the expected number of established infections per year for species $i$.\n\nThe annual risk of at least one infection is the complement of having no infection from either species. Assuming the establishment of infection by *E. granulosus* is independent of infection by *E. multilocularis*, the probability of no infection from either species is the product of the individual probabilities of no infection:\n$$\nP(\\text{No infection, total}) = P(\\text{NoInf}_{\\text{g}}) \\times P(\\text{NoInf}_{\\text{m}})\n$$\n$$\nP(\\text{No infection, total}) = \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\text{g}}\\alpha_{\\text{g}}) \\times \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\text{m}}\\alpha_{\\text{m}}) = \\exp(-(\\lambda_{\\text{g}}\\alpha_{\\text{g}} + \\lambda_{\\text{m}}\\alpha_{\\text{m}}))\n$$\nThe annual risk of at least one infection, $R$, is therefore:\n$$\nR = 1 - P(\\text{No infection, total}) = 1 - \\exp(-(\\lambda_{\\text{g}}\\alpha_{\\text{g}} + \\lambda_{\\text{m}}\\alpha_{\\text{m}}))\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\lambda_{\\text{g}}$ and $\\lambda_{\\text{m}}$:\n$$\nR = 1 - \\exp(-(D A p f_{\\text{g}} \\alpha_{\\text{g}} + D A p f_{\\text{m}} \\alpha_{\\text{m}})) = 1 - \\exp(-D A p (f_{\\text{g}}\\alpha_{\\text{g}} + f_{\\text{m}}\\alpha_{\\text{m}}))\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values.
