It is scientifically grounded in established principles of clinical pharmacology and medical parasitology, is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part response: first, the calculation of the total dose of praziquantel for the patient, justified by dimensional analysis; and second, an outline of the strategy for post-treatment verification of cure, based on the biology of *Taenia saginata*.\n\n**Part 1: Dose Calculation and Dimensional Analysis**\n\nThe foundational principle for weight-based dosing is that the total dose is a function of the patient's body mass and a prescribed specific dose. We are given the following quantities:\n- Patient's body mass, $M = 70 \\text{ kg}$\n- Prescribed specific dose of praziquantel, $D_{\\text{specific}} = 10 \\text{ mg/kg}$\n\nThe total dose, $D_{\\text{total}}$, is calculated by multiplying the specific dose by the patient's mass:\n$$D_{\\text{total}} = D_{\\text{specific}} \\times M$$\n\nTo validate this calculation, we perform a dimensional analysis. The dimensions of a physical quantity are represented by square brackets $[...]$.\nThe dimension of mass, $[M]$, is mass, for which the unit given is kilograms ($\\text{kg}$).\nThe dimension of the specific dose, $[D_{\\text{specific}}]$, is mass of drug per mass of patient, for which the units given are milligrams per kilogram ($\\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}}$).\n\nThe dimensions of the total dose are therefore:\n$$[D_{\\text{total}}] = [D_{\\text{specific}}] \\times [M]$$\nSubstituting the units:\n$$[D_{\\text{total}}] = \\left( \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}} \\right) \\times (\\text{kg})$$\nThe unit of kilograms ($\\text{kg}$) in the denominator cancels with the unit of kilograms in the numerator, yielding the unit of milligrams ($\\text{mg}$):\n$$[D_{\\text{total}}] = \\text{mg}$$\nThis confirms that the resulting quantity is a mass, specifically the mass of the medication to be administered, which is dimensionally correct.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the equation:\n$$D_{\\text{total}} = 10 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}} \\times 70 \\text{ kg}$$\n$$D_{\\text{total}} = 700 \\text{ mg}$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $700$. To express this unambiguously with three significant figures, we can write it in scientific notation as $7.00 \\times 10^2 \\text{ mg}$.\n\n**Part 2: Post-Treatment Verification Strategy**\n\nThe definitive goal of treating a *Taenia saginata* infection is the complete eradication of the parasite from the host. A logical verification strategy must be based on the parasite's fundamental biology, specifically its mechanism of attachment and regeneration.\n\n*   **Parasite Morphology and Attachment:** The adult beef tapeworm, *T. saginata*, resides in the small intestine of the human host. Its structure consists of a scolex (head), a short unsegmented neck, and a long chain of segments known as a strobila. The scolex, which measures approximately $1-2 \\text{ mm}$ in diameter, is the organ of attachment. It is characterized by four powerful suckers but lacks the hooks found in other tapeworms like *Taenia solium* (hence, it is \"unarmed\"). The scolex and its suckers anchor the worm firmly to the mucosa of the upper jejunum.\n\n*   **Parasite Regeneration:** The neck region, located just behind the scolex, is the zone of proliferation (a germinal center). New segments, or proglottids, are continuously produced from the neck. As long as the scolex and neck remain attached to the intestinal wall, the worm can regenerate its entire strobila, even if all existing proglottids are lost or expelled. Therefore, simple passage of proglottids following treatment does not signify a cure. A cure is only confirmed by the expulsion of the scolex.\n\n*   **Mechanism of Praziquantel:** Praziquantel induces a rapid influx of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) into the parasite's cells, causing intense, spastic muscular contraction and paralysis. It also causes vacuolization and damage to the parasite's outer layer, the tegument. This combined effect leads to the detachment of the scolex from the intestinal wall and the expulsion of the paralyzed worm via the host's normal peristaltic activity.\n\n*   **Logical Verification Protocol:**\n    1.  **Stool Collection:** Following administration of the single oral dose of praziquantel, the patient must collect all feces for a period of $48$ to $72$ hours. The paralyzed worm is typically expelled within this timeframe.\n    2.  **Macroscopic Examination:** The collected stool must be carefully examined for remnants of the tapeworm. To facilitate this, the fecal material is often emulsified in water and passed through a fine-mesh sieve. The primary objective of this search is to locate and identify the scolex.\n    3.  **Morphological Identification:** The recovered scolex must be definitively identified. For *T. saginata*, this involves observing its characteristic quadrate shape, the presence of four suckers, and the absence of a rostellum and hooks. Due to its small size, locating the scolex requires meticulous inspection. Recovery of the scolex is the gold standard for confirmation of cure.\n    4.  **Follow-up if Scolex is Not Found:** The scolex is small and can be easily missed or partially digested before expulsion. If the scolex is not recovered, treatment success cannot be immediately confirmed. In this scenario, a follow-up examination is required. The pre-patent period of *T. saginata* (the time from initial infection to the first appearance of eggs or proglottids in the feces) is approximately $2$ to $3$ months. Therefore, stool samples should be re-examined for the presence of *Taenia* eggs or proglottids at $1$-month and $3$-month intervals post-treatment. The absence of eggs and proglottids at the $3$-month mark is considered strong evidence of a cure, even if the scolex was not initially found.\n\nThis two-tiered strategy, combining immediate search for the scolex with long-term monitoring for recurrence, provides a robust and logically sound method for verifying the successful eradication of *Taenia saginata*.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{7.00 \\times 10^{2}}\n$$", "id": "4814364"}, {"introduction": "Effective public health control of *Taenia saginata* depends on interrupting its life cycle, particularly the contamination of pastures where cattle graze.

A numerical calculation is required for $t = 60$ days and $k = 0.03$ day$^{-1}$.\n6.  The final numerical answer must be a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, employing the standard exponential decay model that arises from a constant hazard rate. This model is fundamental in many scientific fields, including survival analysis, epidemiology, and chemical kinetics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information ($k$, $t$, $S(0)$, and the underlying principle) to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nWe begin the derivation. The fundamental relationship between the hazard function, $h(t)$, and the survival function, $S(t)$, is given by:\n$$ h(t) = -\\frac{1}{S(t)} \\frac{d S(t)}{dt} $$\nThis equation states that the hazard rate at time $t$ is the instantaneous rate of failure per unit of time, conditional on survival up to that time $t$.\n\nThe problem states that the hazard rate is constant, so $h(t) = k$ for all $t \\ge 0$. Substituting this into the relationship gives the following ordinary differential equation:\n$$ k = -\\frac{1}{S(t)} \\frac{d S(t)}{dt} $$\n\nThis is a first-order separable differential equation. We can rearrange it to separate the variables $S$ and $t$:\n$$ \\frac{dS(t)}{S(t)} = -k \\, dt $$\n\nTo find the form of $S(t)$, we integrate both sides. We integrate the left side from the initial survival fraction $S(0)$ to the survival fraction $S(t)$ at a later time $t$. We integrate the right side over the corresponding time interval from $0$ to $t$. Using dummy variables of integration, $\\tau$ for time and $S'$ for survival, we have:\n$$ \\int_{S(0)}^{S(t)} \\frac{1}{S'} dS' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, d\\tau $$\n\nEvaluating the integrals yields:\n$$ [\\ln(S')]_{S(0)}^{S(t)} = [-k\\tau]_{0}^{t} $$\n$$ \\ln(S(t)) - \\ln(S(0)) = -k t - (-k \\cdot 0) $$\n$$ \\ln(S(t)) - \\ln(S(0)) = -k t $$\n\nWe are given the initial condition $S(0) = 1$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$ \\ln(S(t)) - \\ln(1) = -k t $$\nSince the natural logarithm of $1$ is $0$ ($\\ln(1) = 0$), the equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\ln(S(t)) = -k t $$\n\nTo solve for $S(t)$, we exponentiate both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\exp(\\ln(S(t))) = \\exp(-k t) $$\n$$ S(t) = \\exp(-k t) $$\nThis is the derived form of the survival function, which describes exponential decay.\n\nNext, we must calculate the viable fraction after $t = 60$ days given a hazard rate of $k = 0.03$ day$^{-1}$. We substitute these values into the derived survival function:\n$$ S(60) = \\exp(-0.03 \\times 60) $$\n\nFirst, we compute the value of the exponent:\n$$ -k t = -0.03 \\, \\text{day}^{-1} \\times 60 \\, \\text{days} = -1.8 $$\nThe exponent is dimensionless, as required.\n\nNow, we calculate the survival fraction:\n$$ S(60) = \\exp(-1.8) $$\nUsing a calculator, we find the numerical value:\n$$ S(60) \\approx 0.165298888... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
