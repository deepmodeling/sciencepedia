This can be solved by applying the principle of mass balance to a control volume.\n\nThe governing principle, as stated, is that for a well-mixed system at steady-state, the rate of production must equal the rate of loss. The accumulation term, which is the rate of change of concentration with time, is zero under steady-state conditions.\n\nLet $C$ be the concentration of cercariae in the water, with units of cercariae per $\\mathrm{m}^3$.

The steady-state mass balance in each well-mixed zone implies concentration scales with source strength and inversely with the control volume and first-order removal. Using the given parameters, the nearshore zone has $50$ snails (area $10\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$ times $5\\,\\text{snails} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$) producing $S_s = 50 \\times 500 = 25{,}000\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$ into a volume $V_s = 10\\,\\mathrm{m} \\times 0.5\\,\\mathrm{m} \\times 1\\,\\mathrm{m} = 5\\,\\mathrm{m^3} = 5{,}000\\,\\mathrm{L}$. Offshore, $10$ snails (area $50\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$ times $0.2\\,\\text{snails} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$) produce $S_o = 5{,}000\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$ into $V_o = 50\\,\\mathrm{m} \\times 2.0\\,\\mathrm{m} \\times 1\\,\\mathrm{m} = 100\\,\\mathrm{m^3} = 100{,}000\\,\\mathrm{L}$. With $k = \\ln(2)/(4\\,\\mathrm{h}) \\approx 0.173\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$, the nearshore concentration is about $C_s \\approx 25{,}000/(0.173 \\times 5{,}000) \\approx 28.9\\,\\mathrm{L^{-1}}$, while offshore $C_o \\approx 5{,}000/(0.173 \\times 100{,}000) \\approx 0.289\\,\\mathrm{L^{-1}}$. Expected dose scales as $C \\times A \\times t$, so the ratio of nearshore to offshore exposure is $\\dfrac{C_s A_s}{C_o A_o} \\approx \\dfrac{28.9 \\times 0.8}{0.289 \\times 1.8} \\approx 44$, meaning wading nearshore yields roughly $40$–$50$ times greater exposure despite the larger wetted area while swimming offshore.**\n\nThis option correctly follows the derivation. It calculates the number of snails, source rates ($S_s, S_o$), and volumes ($V_s, V_o$) correctly. It uses the correct formula for steady-state concentration and converts volumes to liters ($1\\,\\mathrm{m^3}=1000\\,\\mathrm{L}$) to calculate concentrations in $\\mathrm{L^{-1}}$. Let's verify the numerical calculations:\n- $k = \\ln(2)/4 \\approx 0.6931/4 \\approx 0.1733\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$. The value $0.173$ is a reasonable approximation.\n- $C_s = S_s / (k V_s) = 25000\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}} / (0.1733\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}} \\times 5000\\,\\mathrm{L}) \\approx 25000 / 866.5 \\approx 28.85\\,\\mathrm{L^{-1}}$. The value $28.9\\,\\mathrm{L^{-1}}$ is correct.\n- $C_o = S_o / (k V_o) = 5000\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}} / (0.1733\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}} \\times 100000\\,\\mathrm{L}) \\approx 5000 / 17330 \\approx 0.2885\\,\\mathrm{L^{-1}}$. The value $0.289\\,\\mathrm{L^{-1}}$ is correct.\n- The exposure ratio is calculated as $\\frac{28.9 \\times 0.8}{0.289 \\times 1.8} = \\frac{100 \\times 0.289 \\times 0.8}{0.289 \\times 1.8} = 100 \\times \\frac{0.8}{1.8} \\approx 44.44$. The value $\\approx 44$ is correct.\nThe conclusion that nearshore exposure is $40$–$50$ times greater is a correct summary of the result. This option provides a complete and quantitatively accurate explanation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Because the offshore zone encompasses more area, the total number of snails per meter of shoreline is effectively the same as nearshore, so concentrations are similar; the larger skin area while swimming offshore then makes the offshore exposure greater.**\n\nThis option contains several factual errors based on the problem's parameters.\n- It claims the total number of snails is \"effectively the same\". We calculated $N_{\\text{snails},s} = 50$ and $N_{\\text{snails},o} = 10$. These are not \"effectively the same\"; there are 5 times more snails in the nearshore zone per meter of shoreline.\n- It claims \"concentrations are similar\". We calculated that $C_s$ is $100$ times larger than $C_o$. This claim is false.\n- The conclusion that offshore exposure is greater is incorrect, as our primary calculation showed nearshore exposure is $\\approx 44$ times greater.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Cercariae actively seek deeper, darker water and accumulate below the mixed layer; therefore, deeper offshore swimming increases contact with higher concentrations compared to the shoreline.**\n\nThis option introduces a hypothesis about cercarial behavior (vertical migration) that directly contradicts a fundamental assumption of the problem: \"each zone mixes to a quasi-uniform concentration.\" While cercarial behavior might be complex in reality, we are required to solve the problem based on the provided model. According to the model, concentration is uniform throughout the mixing depth in each zone.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Any increase in wetted skin area while swimming necessarily outweighs dilution effects; since $A_o > A_s$, offshore swimming must produce more exposure than nearshore wading irrespective of snail density and depth-related mixing volumes.**\n\nThis is an overgeneralization that is demonstrably false. The exposure ratio depends on both the concentration ratio ($C_s/C_o$) and the area ratio ($A_s/A_o$). Our calculation shows:\n- The concentration ratio is $C_s/C_o = 100$.\n- The area ratio is $A_o/A_s = 1.8/0.8 = 2.25$.\nThe dilution effect (leading to a $100$-fold lower concentration offshore) is far more significant than the increase in wetted area (which is only $2.25$ times larger). The statement that the area effect \"necessarily outweighs\" dilution is false. The claim that this is true \"irrespective of snail density and depth-related mixing volumes\" is also false, as these are precisely the parameters that determine the concentrations and, thus, the magnitude of the dilution effect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4782622"}, {"introduction": "Once exposure has occurred and symptoms appear, a definitive diagnosis can be surprisingly elusive.

The working diagnosis is cercarial dermatitis (swimmer’s itch). In routine histopathology using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), intact cercariae or schistosomula are rarely visualized. Consider the following fundamental base: in a non-permissive host, avian schistosome cercariae penetrate the epidermis, shed their tails, and become schistosomula that do not mature; host innate defenses (complement, proteases, reactive oxygen species, and early neutrophil and macrophage influx) rapidly damage and clear non-viable parasite structures; histologic sections sample only a thin plane of tissue and organisms are small and distributed focally. Let $n(t)$ denote the expected number of intact parasite bodies per routine punch biopsy at time $t$ hours after exposure. Assume clearance from skin is dominated by first-order processes with rate constant $k>0$, such that $n(t)$ decreases monotonically with $t$ (for instance, $n(t)=n_{0}e^{-kt}$ for some $n_{0}>0$).

Intact organisms are rare on H&E because they undergo rapid degeneration and phagocytic clearance in a non-permissive human host, coupled with small size, focal distribution, and thin-section sampling; therefore, detection probability is highest early, with a practical window in the first $6$–$12$ hours after exposure (before extensive lysis), and declines sharply by about $24$ hours as $n(t)$ falls approximately exponentially.\n\nB. Intact organisms are rare because cercariae transform into adult worms within human skin by $48$ hours, leaving only their cuticle visible on routine sections; accordingly, detection probability peaks at approximately $72$ hours when adults are established.\n\nC. Intact organisms are rare because cercariae remain viable for weeks and migrate into deeper muscle, beyond the reach of superficial biopsy; consequently, detection probability increases with time, and sampling at $1$ week post-exposure offers the best chance to find them.\n\nD. Intact organisms are rare because routine formalin fixatives immediately dissolve parasite tissues regardless of host response; thus, timing does not influence detection probability, which remains constant over the first $72$ hours.\n\nE.

This means the number of structurally intact organisms, $n(t)$, decreases quickly after the initial infection.\n    *   **Sampling Error**: Even if organisms were present, detecting them is a challenge. A standard punch biopsy removes a small cylinder of tissue. This tissue is then sliced into extremely thin sections (micrometer-scale thickness, $s$). The organisms themselves are small and are stated to be \"focally distributed\". Therefore, the probability that a random thin section happens to intersect one of the few, small, and sparsely distributed organisms is inherently low.\n    *   **Combined Effect**: The rarity is a product of both rapid biological clearance (reducing the number of targets over time) and the low geometric probability of sampling a target (even when present).\n\n2.  **Effect of Timing on Detection Probability**:\n    The problem defines the expected number of intact parasites as a monotonically decreasing function of time, $n(t)$, exemplified by $n(t) = n_0 e^{-kt}$. The detection probability is stated to be proportional to $n(t)$. Let $P_{detect}(t)$ be the probability of detection at time $t$. Then, $P_{detect}(t) \\propto n(t)$. Since $n(t)$ is a strictly decreasing function for $t > 0$ (because $k > 0$), $P_{detect}(t)$ must also be a strictly decreasing function of time.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The probability of detection is maximal at the earliest time point (theoretically, at $t=0$) and decreases exponentially thereafter. Therefore, to maximize the chance of finding an intact organism, the biopsy must be performed as early as possible after exposure. The likelihood of a successful detection will diminish significantly as time passes. For instance, after one half-life, $t_{1/2} = \\ln(2)/k$, the number of organisms is halved. After a few half-lives, the number becomes negligible. Given the \"rapid\" clearance, the time scale is expected to be in hours, not days or weeks.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Intact organisms are rare on H&E because they undergo rapid degeneration and phagocytic clearance in a non-permissive human host, coupled with small size, focal distribution, and thin-section sampling; therefore, detection probability is highest early, with a practical window in the first $6$–$12$ hours after exposure (before extensive lysis), and declines sharply by about $24$ hours as $n(t)$ falls approximately exponentially.**\n\nThis option correctly integrates all the provided principles.\n*   It correctly identifies the reasons for rarity: rapid clearance in a non-permissive host, and the sampling challenges of small size, focal distribution, and thin sections.\n*   It correctly deduces the effect of timing: detection probability is highest early and declines sharply (exponentially), consistent with $P_{detect}(t) \\propto n(t) = n_0 e^{-kt}$.\n*   The specified time window ($6$–$12$ hours, declining by $24$ hours) is a plausible, practical consequence of a \"rapid\" exponential decay process.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Intact organisms are rare because cercariae transform into adult worms within human skin by $48$ hours, leaving only their cuticle visible on routine sections; accordingly, detection probability peaks at approximately $72$ hours when adults are established.**\n\nThis option contradicts the fundamental premises.\n*   It claims that cercariae mature into \"adult worms\". The problem explicitly states that in a non-permissive host, \"schistosomula... do not mature\".\n*   It claims the detection probability peaks at $72$ hours. This contradicts the mathematical model where $n(t)$ is monotonically decreasing, meaning the detection probability must also be monotonically decreasing.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Intact organisms are rare because cercariae remain viable for weeks and migrate into deeper muscle, beyond the reach of superficial biopsy; consequently, detection probability increases with time, and sampling at $1$ week post-exposure offers the best chance to find them.**\n\nThis option contradicts multiple premises.\n*   It claims parasites \"remain viable for weeks\". The problem states the host's innate defenses \"rapidly damage and clear\" the parasites.\n*   It claims parasites migrate to \"deeper muscle\", which is not stated in the premises.\n*   It claims detection probability \"increases with time\". This directly contradicts the mathematical model of first-order decay, where $n(t)$ is a monotonically decreasing function.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Intact organisms are rare because routine formalin fixatives immediately dissolve parasite tissues regardless of host response; thus, timing does not influence detection probability, which remains constant over the first $72$ hours.**\n\nThis option introduces an external, unsupported mechanism and contradicts the given model.\n*   It attributes rarity to fixative artifact, a premise not included in the \"fundamental base\" provided. The problem grounds the phenomenon in in-vivo biological processes.\n*   It claims that timing \"does not influence detection probability\" and that it \"remains constant\". This directly contradicts the premise that clearance is a first-order process modeled by $n(t) = n_0 e^{-kt}$, which is explicitly time-dependent and decreasing.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Intact organisms are rare because parasite antigens are uniformly masked by human keratin and require special stains; timing has negligible impact since the number of organisms stays stable over the first $24$ hours.**\n\nThis option is flawed on multiple grounds.\n*   It introduces \"antigen masking\", which is irrelevant to the visualization of whole organisms via H&E staining, a morphological technique.\n*   It claims the \"number of organisms stays stable over the first $24$ hours\". This directly contradicts the given premises of \"rapid... clearance\" and a first-order decay model with rate constant $k > 0$.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4782613"}]}
