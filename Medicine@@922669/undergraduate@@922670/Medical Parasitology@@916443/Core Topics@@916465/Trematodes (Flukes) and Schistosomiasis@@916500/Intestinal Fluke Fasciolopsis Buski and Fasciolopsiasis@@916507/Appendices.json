The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. It requires the application of fundamental definitions from hematology to compute a cell fraction from absolute counts.\n\nThe primary objective is to calculate the eosinophil fraction in the peripheral blood. This fraction, which we shall denote as $f_{eos}$, is defined as the ratio of the absolute eosinophil count to the total white blood cell (WBC) count.\n\nLet $N_{eos}$ represent the absolute eosinophil count and $N_{WBC}$ represent the total white blood cell count.
