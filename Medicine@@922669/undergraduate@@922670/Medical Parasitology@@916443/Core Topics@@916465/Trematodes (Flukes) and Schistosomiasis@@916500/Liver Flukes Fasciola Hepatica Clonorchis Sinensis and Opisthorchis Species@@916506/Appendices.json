It contains no contradictions, missing information, or logical fallacies. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected number of viable metacercariae ingested per person per week. We can model this by considering the total mass of fish consumed as being divided into two distinct portions: an untreated portion and a treated (partially frozen) portion.\n\nLet the following variables be defined:\n- $M$: the total mass of fish consumed per person per week, $M = 150\\,\\mathrm{g}$.\n- $\\rho$: the initial density of viable metacercariae in the fish, $\\rho = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{g}^{-1}$.\n- $f$: the fraction of servings that are treated by freezing, $f = 0.30$.\n- $\\eta$: the efficacy of the freezing practice, representing the fraction of metacercariae that are inactivated, $\\eta = 0.70$.\n\nThe total expected number of ingested metacercariae, $E[N]$, is the sum of the expected numbers from the untreated and treated portions.\n$E[N] = E[N_{\\text{untreated}}] + E[N_{\\text{treated}}]$\n\nFirst, we consider the portion of fish that is consumed without undergoing the freezing treatment.\n- The fraction of servings that are untreated is $(1 - f)$.\n- The mass of untreated fish consumed is $M_{\\text{untreated}} = M \\times (1 - f)$.\n- The density of viable metacercariae in this portion remains the initial density, $\\rho$.\n- The expected number of metacercariae from the untreated portion is the product of its mass and the parasite density:\n$$E[N_{\\text{untreated}}] = M_{\\text{untreated}} \\times \\rho = M(1 - f)\\rho$$\n\nNext, we consider the portion of fish that is treated by freezing.\n- The fraction of servings that are treated is $f$.\n- The mass of treated fish consumed is $M_{\\text{treated}} = M \\times f$.\n- The freezing practice inactivates a fraction $\\eta$ of the metacercariae. Therefore, the fraction of metacercariae that remain viable is $(1 - \\eta)$.\n- The effective density of viable metacercariae in the treated portion is $\\rho_{\\text{treated}} = \\rho(1 - \\eta)$.\n- The expected number of metacercariae from the treated portion is the product of its mass and its effective parasite density:\n$$E[N_{\\text{treated}}] = M_{\\text{treated}} \\times \\rho_{\\text{treated}} = (M f) \\times (\\rho(1 - \\eta))$$\n\nThe total expected number of viable metacercariae ingested is the sum of these two quantities:\n$$E[N] = E[N_{\\text{untreated}}] + E[N_{\\text{treated}}] = M(1-f)\\rho + Mf\\rho(1-\\eta)$$\nWe can factor out the common terms $M$ and $\\rho$:\n$$E[N] = M\\rho \\left[ (1-f) + f(1-\\eta) \\right]$$\nSimplifying the expression within the brackets:\n$$E[N] = M\\rho \\left[ 1 - f + f - f\\eta \\right]$$\n$$E[N] = M\\rho(1 - f\\eta)$$\nThis final expression represents the baseline exposure, $M\\rho$, reduced by a factor corresponding to the overall protective effect of the intervention, which is the product of its coverage ($f$) and its efficacy ($\\eta$).\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $M = 150$\n- $\\rho = 0.8$\n- $f = 0.30$\n- $\\eta = 0.70$\n\n$$E[N] = 150 \\times 0.8 \\times (1 - 0.30 \\times 0.70)$$\nFirst, calculate the product inside the parentheses:\n$$f\\eta = 0.30 \\times 0.70 = 0.21$$\nSubstitute this back into the equation:\n$$E[N] = 150 \\times 0.8 \\times (1 - 0.21)$$\n$$E[N] = 150 \\times 0.8 \\times 0.79$$\nThe baseline exposure (expected number ingested if no freezing were applied) is:\n$$150 \\times 0.8 = 120$$\nNow, apply the reduction factor:\n$$E[N] = 120 \\times 0.79$$\n$$E[N] = 94.8$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures.
