The biology of *Schistosoma haematobium* itself provides crucial clues for improving efficiency, as its egg excretion follows a distinct daily rhythm, peaking around midday. This exercise challenges you to use this biological knowledge to design an optimal sampling strategy, demonstrating how parasitology, epidemiology, and basic statistics intersect to maximize the success of public health programs. [@problem_id:4811557]", "problem": "In urinary schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma haematobium, egg excretion varies by time of day, with higher excretion near midday. In a limited-resource survey using urine filtration microscopy, assume that for a single infected participant the mean true egg concentration in urine over three disjoint collection windows is approximately constant within each window, with values (from a pilot study) of $c_{\\mathrm{morning}} = 1.5$ eggs per $10$ milliliters, $c_{\\mathrm{midday}} = 5.0$ eggs per $10$ milliliters, and $c_{\\mathrm{evening}} = 0.8$ eggs per $10$ milliliters. Each field sample is exactly $10$ milliliters, and the filter has an egg retention efficiency of $\\eta = 0.75$. The number of eggs retained on the filter from any one sample collected in window $w$ is modeled as a Poisson random variable with mean $\\mu_{w}$, where $\\mu_{w}$ equals the expected number of eggs entering the filter multiplied by the retention efficiency. Samples collected in different windows are independent conditional on their means. A participant is classified as detected-positive if at least one egg is observed across all of their collected samples.\n\nLogistical constraints for a single-day survey impose that no more than $3$ samples can be collected from a participant in total, at most $1$ of these can be collected in the midday window, and at least $1$ must be collected in the morning window. You may choose the remaining sample or samples in any window while respecting these constraints.\n\nUsing only these assumptions and fundamental properties of the Poisson distribution and independence, first compute the expected retained egg count per single $10$ milliliter sample for each window. Then determine the sampling allocation that maximizes the detection probability for this participant under the stated constraints, and compute the maximum achievable detection probability under that allocation. Express the final detection probability as a unitless decimal, and round your final answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The first step is to compute the expected number of eggs retained on the filter per single $10$ milliliter sample for each of the three collection windows. This is the mean, $\\mu_w$, of the Poisson distribution for a sample from window $w$. The problem states that $\\mu_w$ is the product of the true mean egg concentration, $c_w$, and the filter retention efficiency, $\\eta$.\n\nThe given values are:\n- Morning concentration: $c_{\\mathrm{morning}} = 1.5$ eggs per $10$ mL\n- Midday concentration: $c_{\\mathrm{midday}} = 5.0$ eggs per $10$ mL\n- Evening concentration: $c_{\\mathrm{evening}} = 0.8$ eggs per $10$ mL\n- Filter retention efficiency: $\\eta = 0.75$\n\nThe expected retained egg counts per sample are:\nFor the morning window:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{morning}} = c_{\\mathrm{morning}} \\times \\eta = 1.5 \\times 0.75 = 1.125\n$$\nFor the midday window:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{midday}} = c_{\\mathrm{midday}} \\times \\eta = 5.0 \\times 0.75 = 3.75\n$$\nFor the evening window:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{evening}} = c_{\\mathrm{evening}} \\times \\eta = 0.8 \\times 0.75 = 0.6\n$$\n\nA participant is classified as detected-positive if at least one egg is observed across all collected samples. Let $n_{\\mathrm{morning}}$, $n_{\\mathrm{midday}}$, and $n_{\\mathrm{evening}}$ be the number of samples collected in the morning, midday, and evening windows, respectively. Let $X_i$ be the number of eggs counted in the $i$-th sample, where $X_i \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(\\mu_i)$, with $\\mu_i$ being the appropriate mean for the window in which sample $i$ was collected.\n\nDue to the property that the sum of independent Poisson random variables is also a Poisson random variable, the total number of eggs observed, $S$, across all samples follows a Poisson distribution with a mean, $\\lambda$, equal to the sum of the means of the individual samples.\n$$\nS \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(\\lambda)\n$$\nwhere\n$$\n\\lambda = n_{\\mathrm{morning}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{morning}} + n_{\\mathrm{midday}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{midday}} + n_{\\mathrm{evening}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{evening}}\n$$\nThe probability of detecting the infection is the probability of observing at least one egg, $P(S > 0)$. This is the complement of observing zero eggs, $P(S=0)$. For a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$, the probability of observing $k$ events is $P(S=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$.\nTherefore, $P(S=0) = \\exp(-\\lambda)$. The detection probability, $P_{\\text{detect}}$, is:\n$$\nP_{\\text{detect}} = P(S > 0) = 1 - P(S=0) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)\n$$\nTo maximize the detection probability, we must maximize the value of $\\lambda$, since $1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $\\lambda$ for $\\lambda \\ge 0$. The task reduces to an optimization problem: maximize $\\lambda$ subject to the given logistical constraints.\n\nThe constraints are:\n1.  Total number of samples: $n_{\\mathrm{morning}} + n_{\\mathrm{midday}} + n_{\\mathrm{evening}} \\le 3$\n2.  Midday samples: $n_{\\mathrm{midday}} \\le 1$\n3.  Morning samples: $n_{\\mathrm{morning}} \\ge 1$\n4.

The order of the means is $\\mu_{\\mathrm{midday}} > \\mu_{\\mathrm{morning}} > \\mu_{\\mathrm{evening}}$. Furthermore, to maximize $\\lambda$, we should use the maximum total number of samples allowed, which is $3$. So, $n_{\\mathrm{morning}} + n_{\\mathrm{midday}} + n_{\\mathrm{evening}} = 3$.\n\nWe apply a greedy strategy:\n1.  The window with the highest mean is midday ($\\mu_{\\mathrm{midday}} = 3.75$). The constraint is $n_{\\mathrm{midday}} \\le 1$. To maximize $\\lambda$, we should choose $n_{\\mathrm{midday}} = 1$. This uses $1$ of our $3$ samples.\n2.  The problem requires at least one morning sample ($n_{\\mathrm{morning}} \\ge 1$). Since we have not yet allocated a morning sample, we must allocate at least one. This uses a second sample.\n3.  We have used $2$ samples and have $1$ remaining sample to allocate. The required constraints ($n_{\\mathrm{midday}}=1$, $n_{\\mathrm{morning}} \\ge 1$) are satisfied. The remaining choices for the third sample are an additional morning sample or an evening sample. Comparing their means, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{morning}} = 1.125$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{evening}} = 0.6$. Since $\\mu_{\\mathrm{morning}} > \\mu_{\\mathrm{evening}}$, we allocate the final sample to the morning window to maximize $\\lambda$.\n\nThis results in the optimal sampling allocation:\n- $n_{\\mathrm{morning}} = 2$ samples\n- $n_{\\mathrm{midday}} = 1$ sample\n- $n_{\\mathrm{evening}} = 0$ samples\n\nLet's verify this allocation against the constraints:\n- Total samples: $2 + 1 + 0 = 3$. This satisfies $n_{\\text{total}} \\le 3$.\n- Midday samples: $1$. This satisfies $n_{\\mathrm{midday}} \\le 1$.\n- Morning samples: $2$. This satisfies $n_{\\mathrm{morning}} \\ge 1$.\nThe allocation is valid.\n\nNow, we compute the maximum total mean, $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$, for this optimal allocation:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{max}} = (2 \\times \\mu_{\\mathrm{morning}}) + (1 \\times \\mu_{\\mathrm{midday}}) + (0 \\times \\mu_{\\mathrm{evening}})\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{max}} = (2 \\times 1.125) + (1 \\times 3.75) + 0 = 2.25 + 3.75 = 6.0\n$$\nFinally, we compute the maximum achievable detection probability using this value of $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$:\n$$\nP_{\\text{max}} = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\text{max}}) = 1 - \\exp(-6.0)\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\nP_{\\text{max}} \\approx 1 - 0.0024787521... = 0.997521247...\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$\nP_{\\text{max}} \\approx 0.9975\n$$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0.9975} $$", "id": "4811557"}, {"introduction": "A diagnostic test is a critical tool, but its performance is not absolute; it depends heavily on the population in which it is used.
