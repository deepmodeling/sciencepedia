In a single host-to-vector-to-host cycle, parasites pass sequentially through biological “filters,” each of which removes a fraction of the population. Treat each filter as an independent event acting multiplicatively on the parasite population. Define the overall transmission efficiency per bite $E$ as the fraction of parasites present in the accessible dermal microenvironment of the initially infected mammalian host at the instant of the first sandfly bloodmeal that ultimately establish as intracellular amastigotes in macrophages of a subsequently bitten naïve mammalian host after one onward sandfly bite.

At each stage, a parasite is either lost or it survives. These are mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes. Therefore, the sum of their probabilities (or proportions) must be $1$.\n$$l_i + s_i = 1$$\nThis is consistent with the provided definition, $s_i = 1 - l_i$. The proportion of parasites lost at stage $i$ is $l_i$, which can be expressed in terms of the survival fraction as $l_i = 1 - s_i$.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the overall efficiency, $E$. Let $N_0$ be the initial number of parasites present in the accessible dermal microenvironment of the first mammalian host. The transmission cycle consists of $8$ sequential, independent stages.\n\nLet $N_i$ be the number of parasites that have successfully passed through stage $i$. The number of parasites surviving stage $1$ is the initial population multiplied by the survival fraction for stage $1$:\n$$N_1 = N_0 \\cdot s_1$$\nThe number of parasites surviving stage $2$ are those that survived stage $1$ and then also survived stage $2$. Since the events are independent, we multiply the populations by the next survival fraction:\n$$N_2 = N_1 \\cdot s_2 = (N_0 \\cdot s_1) \\cdot s_2 = N_0 \\cdot s_1 \\cdot s_2$$\nThis process is repeated for all $8$ stages. The final number of parasites, $N_{final}$, that have successfully established as amastigotes in the new host is the number that has survived all $8$ sequential filters:\n$$N_{final} = N_0 \\cdot s_1 \\cdot s_2 \\cdot s_3 \\cdot s_4 \\cdot s_5 \\cdot s_6 \\cdot s_7 \\cdot s_8$$\nThis can be expressed compactly using the product operator:\n$$N_{final} = N_0 \\prod_{i=1}^{8} s_i$$\nThe overall transmission efficiency, $E$, is defined as the fraction of the initial parasite population that successfully completes the entire cycle. This is the ratio of the final population to the initial population:\n$$E = \\frac{N_{final}}{N_0} = \\frac{N_0 \\prod_{i=1}^{8} s_i}{N_0}$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for $E$ in terms of the survival fractions:\n$$E = \\prod_{i=1}^{8} s_i = s_1 \\cdot s_2 \\cdot s_3 \\cdot s_4 \\cdot s_5 \\cdot s_6 \\cdot s_7 \\cdot s_8$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $E$. First, we calculate each survival fraction $s_i$ from the given loss fraction $l_i$ using $s_i = 1 - l_i$.\n- $s_1 = 1 - l_1 = 1 - 0.9965 = 0.0035$\n- $s_2 = 1 - l_2 = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$\n- $s_3 = 1 - l_3 = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25$\n- $s_4 = 1 - l_4 = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30$\n- $s_5 = 1 - l_5 = 1 - 0.50 = 0.50$\n- $s_6 = 1 - l_6 = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$\n- $s_7 = 1 - l_7 = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$\n- $s_8 = 1 - l_8 = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$\n\nNext, we calculate the product of these survival fractions:\n$$E = (0.0035) \\times (0.60) \\times (0.25) \\times (0.30) \\times (0.50) \\times (0.40) \\times (0.70) \\times (0.20)$$\n$$E = 0.00000441$$\nThe problem requires the result to be reported to four significant figures.
