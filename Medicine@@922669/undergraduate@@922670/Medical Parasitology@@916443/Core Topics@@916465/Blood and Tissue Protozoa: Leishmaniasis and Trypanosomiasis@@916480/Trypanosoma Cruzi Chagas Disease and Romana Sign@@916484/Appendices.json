Calculate the likelihood ratios for the positive Romana's sign and the positive IgM test.\n3.  Combine the updated prior odds with the likelihood ratios to compute the final posterior odds, and convert this to the posterior probability.\n\n**Stage 1: Update the Prior Probability**\n\nThe initial or baseline pre-test probability for a child from the specified population is $P_{prior_0}(D) = 0.015$. The corresponding probability of not having the disease is $P_{prior_0}(D^c) = 1 - 0.015 = 0.985$.\n\nThe baseline prior odds of having the disease are given by the ratio of the probability of having the disease to the probability of not having it:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{prior_0}(D) = \\frac{P_{prior_0}(D)}{P_{prior_0}(D^c)} = \\frac{0.015}{0.985} = \\frac{15}{985} = \\frac{3}{197}\n$$\n\nThe problem states that conjunctival contamination confers an odds ratio ($OR$) of $4$.

Triatomine insects (commonly called kissing bugs) transmit Trypanosoma cruzi through stercorarian contamination, and conjunctival inoculation can lead to the early clinical manifestation known as Romana's sign (unilateral painless periorbital edema). Consider the following scientifically grounded facts and survey measurements.\n\nFundamental base:\n- In a household infestation survey, the observed infestation fraction under imperfect detection is the product of the true infestation fraction and the detection sensitivity. If the detection sensitivity is known, the true infestation fraction can be inferred from the observed fraction by dividing by sensitivity. \n- The expected number of events in a population over a time horizon equals the sum of expected per-individual per-time probabilities, under independence and stationarity of exposure.\n- In an infested household, each triatomine has some nightly probability of blood feeding, and feeding events are distributed across residents.

This can be calculated by determining the total number of \"risk events\" (a feeding by an infected, defecating triatomine) and multiplying this by the probability that such an event leads to Romana's sign. The calculation proceeds in a stepwise fashion.\n\n**Step 1: Estimate the true household infestation fraction**\nThe observed infestation fraction in the sample, $\\hat{p}_{H, obs}$, is the ratio of infested households found to the total number of households sampled.\n$$ \\hat{p}_{H, obs} = \\frac{n_{H, obs}}{n_H} = \\frac{54}{240} = 0.225 $$\nThis observed fraction underestimates the true fraction due to imperfect detection. The true infestation fraction, $\\hat{p}_{H, true}$, is inferred by correcting for the detection sensitivity, $S$.\n$$ \\hat{p}_{H, true} = \\frac{\\hat{p}_{H, obs}}{S} = \\frac{0.225}{0.75} = 0.30 $$\nThus, we estimate that $30\\%$ of households in the village are truly infested.\n\n**Step 2: Estimate the total number of triatomine bugs in the village**\nFirst, we find the total number of infested households, $N_{H, inf}$, in the village by applying the true infestation fraction to the total number of households.\n$$ N_{H, inf} = N_{H, total} \\times \\hat{p}_{H, true} = 500 \\times 0.30 = 150 \\text{ households} $$\nNext, we calculate the total triatomine population, $N_T$, by multiplying the number of infested households by the average density of bugs per infested household, $D_T$.\n$$ N_T = N_{H, inf} \\times D_T = 150 \\times 3 = 450 \\text{ bugs} $$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of exposure-relevant feeding events over the season**\nAn exposure-relevant event is a feeding by a triatomine that is infected and defecates near the bite. We first find the total number of feeding events over the $T = 90$ night season.\n$$ N_{feeds, total} = N_T \\times p_{feed} \\times T = 450 \\times 0.35 \\times 90 = 14{,}175 $$\nFrom these, the number of feeds by infected bugs is:\n$$ N_{feeds, inf} = N_{feeds, total} \\times p_{inf} = 14{,}175 \\times 0.40 = 5{,}670 $$\nThe total number of \"risk events\", $N_{risk}$, where an infected bug also defecates, is:\n$$ N_{risk} = N_{feeds, inf} \\times p_{def} = 5{,}670 \\times 0.90 = 5{,}103 $$\nThis is the total number of potential conjunctival inoculation events distributed among the village population over the season.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the population-averaged probability of a risk event causing Romana's sign**\nThe probability of a host being inoculated depends on the bite location (face or not), which is affected by bed net use. We must calculate a population-averaged probability of a bite being on the face, $\\bar{p}_{face}$.\nThe proportion of residents not using nets is $(1 - f_{net}) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\nThe proportion of residents using nets is $f_{net} = 0.30$.\nFor unprotected residents, the probability of a facial bite is $p_{face, unprot} = 0.15$.\nFor protected residents, this probability is reduced by $R_{net} = 0.50$:\n$$ p_{face, prot} = p_{face, unprot} \\times (1 - R_{net}) = 0.15 \\times (1 - 0.50) = 0.075 $$\nThe population-averaged probability of a facial bite is the weighted average across both groups:\n$$ \\bar{p}_{face} = (1 - f_{net}) \\times p_{face, unprot} + f_{net} \\times p_{face, prot} $$\n$$ \\bar{p}_{face} = (0.70 \\times 0.15) + (0.30 \\times 0.075) = 0.105 + 0.0225 = 0.1275 $$\nNow, we can find the probability that a single risk event leads to Romana's sign, $P(Romana | \\text{risk})$. This is the product of the probabilities of the subsequent events in the causal chain: a facial bite, successful conjunctival contamination, successful infection, and presentation of Romana's sign.\n$$ P(Romana | \\text{risk}) = \\bar{p}_{face} \\times p_{conj} \\times p_{succ\\_inf} \\times p_{romana} $$\n$$ P(Romana | \\text{risk}) = 0.1275 \\times 0.05 \\times 0.30 \\times 0.60 = 0.0011475 $$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the expected number of Romana's sign cases**\nThe total expected number of cases is the product of the total number of risk events and the probability that any one of those events results in Romana's sign.\n$$ E[N_{Romana}] = N_{risk} \\times P(Romana | \\text{risk}) $$\n$$ E[N_{Romana}] = 5{,}103 \\times 0.0011475 = 5.8569925 $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested gives $5.86$.\nTherefore, the expected number of Romana's sign cases in the village over the $90$-night season is approximately $5.86$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.86}$$", "id": "4818389"}, {"introduction": "Modern diagnostics often involve multiple tests, which can sometimes yield conflicting results.
