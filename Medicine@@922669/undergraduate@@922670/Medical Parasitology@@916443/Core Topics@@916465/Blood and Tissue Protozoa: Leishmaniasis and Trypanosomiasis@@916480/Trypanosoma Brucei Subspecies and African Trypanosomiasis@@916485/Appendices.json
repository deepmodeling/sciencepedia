The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n**Part 1: Baseline Cumulative Dose Calculation**\n\nFirst, we calculate the standard daily dose for the patient under normal physiological conditions. The patient's weight is given as $W = 60$ kg, and the standard dosing regimen for pentamidine is a rate of $D_{rate, norm} = 4$ mg/kg/day.\n\nThe daily dose, $D_{daily, norm}$, is the product of the dosing rate and the patient's weight:\n$$D_{daily, norm} = D_{rate, norm} \\times W$$\n$$D_{daily, norm} = 4 \\, \\text{mg/kg/day} \\times 60 \\, \\text{kg} = 240 \\, \\text{mg/day}$$\nThe treatment duration is specified as $T = 7$ consecutive days.

The rate of administration is the dosing rate, which we can denote as $R_0$. The rate of elimination is the product of the total body clearance, $CL_T$, and the average steady-state plasma concentration, $C_{ss,avg}$.\n\n$$R_0 = CL_T \\times C_{ss,avg}$$\n\nThe therapeutic goal is to maintain the same average steady-state exposure, which means $C_{ss,avg}$ must remain constant between the normal and impaired states. We can express $C_{ss,avg}$ as:\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{R_0}{CL_T}$$\n\nLet the subscript 'norm' denote normal renal function and 'imp' denote impaired renal function. To maintain the same exposure:\n$$C_{ss,avg,norm} = C_{ss,avg,imp}$$\n$$\\frac{R_{0,norm}}{CL_{T,norm}} = \\frac{R_{0,imp}}{CL_{T,imp}}$$\nSolving for the adjusted dosing rate, $R_{0,imp}$, we get the scaling relationship:\n$$R_{0,imp} = R_{0,norm} \\times \\frac{CL_{T,imp}}{CL_{T,norm}}$$\nThis equation shows that the required maintenance dose rate must be adjusted in direct proportion to the change in the patient's total body clearance.\n\n**Calculation of Adjusted Clearance:**\nTotal body clearance ($CL_T$) is the sum of renal clearance ($CL_R$) and nonrenal clearance ($CL_{NR}$):\n$$CL_T = CL_R + CL_{NR}$$\nUnder normal conditions, a fraction $f_r = 0.40$ of the total clearance is renal.\n$$CL_{R,norm} = f_r \\times CL_{T,norm} = 0.40 \\times CL_{T,norm}$$\n$$CL_{NR,norm} = (1 - f_r) \\times CL_{T,norm} = (1 - 0.40) \\times CL_{T,norm} = 0.60 \\times CL_{T,norm}$$\nIn the state of renal impairment, nonrenal clearance is unchanged:\n$$CL_{NR,imp} = CL_{NR,norm} = 0.60 \\times CL_{T,norm}$$\nThe patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is reduced to $0.50$ of normal, and renal clearance scales proportionally.\n$$CL_{R,imp} = 0.50 \\times CL_{R,norm} = 0.50 \\times (0.40 \\times CL_{T,norm}) = 0.20 \\times CL_{T,norm}$$\nThe new total clearance, $CL_{T,imp}$, is the sum of the impaired renal and nonrenal components:\n$$CL_{T,imp} = CL_{R,imp} + CL_{NR,imp}$$\n$$CL_{T,imp} = (0.20 \\times CL_{T,norm}) + (0.60 \\times CL_{T,norm}) = 0.80 \\times CL_{T,norm}$$\nThe ratio of impaired to normal clearance is therefore:\n$$\\frac{CL_{T,imp}}{CL_{T,norm}} = \\frac{0.80 \\times CL_{T,norm}}{CL_{T,norm}} = 0.80$$\n\n**Calculation of Adjusted Dose:**\nUsing the derived scaling relationship, the adjusted dosing rate, $D_{rate, imp}$, is $0.80$ times the normal rate:\n$$D_{rate, imp} = D_{rate, norm} \\times \\frac{CL_{T,imp}}{CL_{T,norm}}$$\n$$D_{rate, imp} = (4 \\, \\text{mg/kg/day}) \\times 0.80 = 3.2 \\, \\text{mg/kg/day}$$\nThe adjusted daily dose, $D_{daily, imp}$, for the $W = 60$ kg patient is:\n$$D_{daily, imp} = D_{rate, imp} \\times W = 3.2 \\, \\text{mg/kg/day} \\times 60 \\, \\text{kg} = 192 \\, \\text{mg/day}$$\nFinally, the adjusted $7$-day cumulative dose, $D_{cum, imp}$, is:\n$$D_{cum, imp} = D_{daily, imp} \\times T = 192 \\, \\text{mg/day} \\times 7 \\, \\text{days} = 1344 \\, \\text{mg}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

Only stumpy forms can differentiate into midgut procyclic forms in the tsetse fly. Assume the following foundational facts: stumpy cells in the bloodmeal act independently with regard to establishing midgut procyclics, slender cells do not establish midgut procyclics, and infection of the tsetse fly is defined as the event that at least one midgut procyclic colony is successfully established after the bloodmeal.\n\nSuppose the bloodmeal contains exactly $n$ trypanosomes, and the host parasitemia is such that a proportion $f$ of bloodstream forms are stumpy, with the remainder $1 - f$ slender.

The statement \"a proportion $f$ of bloodstream forms are stumpy\" is interpreted in the standard probabilistic sense: any single trypanosome in the blood has an independent probability $f$ of being a stumpy form. This implies that the number of stumpy forms in a sample of size $n$ is a random variable following a binomial distribution. Under this standard interpretation, the problem is well-posed and has a unique, meaningful solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation\nLet $I$ be the event of a successful tsetse fly infection. The problem requires the calculation of the probability $P(I)$.\n\nThe bloodmeal contains $n$ trypanosomes. The proportion of stumpy forms in the host's blood is given as $f$. This is interpreted as the probability that any individual trypanosome is of the stumpy morphotype. The $n$ trypanosomes in the bloodmeal constitute a set of $n$ independent Bernoulli trials, where success is defined as a trypanosome being stumpy.\n\nLet $K$ be the random variable representing the number of stumpy forms in the bloodmeal. $K$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $f$, denoted as $K \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, f)$. The probability mass function of $K$ is given by:\n$$\nP(K=k) = \\binom{n}{k} f^k (1-f)^{n-k}, \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, n\\}\n$$\n\nInfection is defined as the establishment of at least one midgut procyclic colony. Slender forms do not contribute to infection. Each of the $k$ stumpy forms has an independent probability $p$ of establishing a colony.\n\nLet us find the conditional probability of infection, given that there are $k$ stumpy forms in the bloodmeal, $P(I|K=k)$. It is more straightforward to first calculate the probability of the complementary event, i.e., no infection, given $K=k$.\nThe probability that a single stumpy form *fails* to establish a colony is $1-p$.\nSince the $k$ stumpy forms act independently, the probability that *none* of them establish a colony is $(1-p)^k$.\nTherefore, the probability of at least one colony being established (i.e., infection) given $k$ stumpy forms is:\n$$\nP(I|K=k) = 1 - (1-p)^k\n$$\nThis holds for $k > 0$. If $k=0$, there are no stumpy forms, and infection is impossible. The formula correctly yields $P(I|K=0) = 1-(1-p)^0 = 1-1=0$, which is consistent.\n\nTo find the total probability of infection, $P(I)$, we use the law of total probability, summing over all possible values of $k$:\n$$\nP(I) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} P(I|K=k) P(K=k)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the conditional probability and the probability mass function of $K$:\n$$\nP(I) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\left[1 - (1-p)^k\\right] \\binom{n}{k} f^k (1-f)^{n-k}\n$$\nThis sum can be separated into two parts:\n$$\nP(I) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} f^k (1-f)^{n-k} - \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (1-p)^k \\binom{n}{k} f^k (1-f)^{n-k}\n$$\nThe first term is the sum of all probabilities for a binomial distribution $\\text{Binomial}(n, f)$, which identity is $1$. This is a direct result of the binomial theorem: $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^k b^{n-k} = (a+b)^n$. Here, $a=f$ and $b=1-f$, so the sum is $(f + (1-f))^n = 1^n = 1$.\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} f^k (1-f)^{n-k} = 1\n$$\nThe second term can be rearranged by grouping the powers of $k$:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} \\left[(1-p)f\\right]^k (1-f)^{n-k}\n$$\nThis expression is also in the form of a binomial expansion, with $a = (1-p)f$ and $b = 1-f$. Thus, the sum is:\n$$\n\\left[(1-p)f + (1-f)\\right]^n = [f - pf + 1 - f]^n = (1 - pf)^n\n$$\nCombining the two results:\n$$\nP(I) = 1 - (1 - pf)^n\n$$\nThis is the general analytic expression for the probability of infection.\n\nThe problem requires substituting the given value $p = 0.3$.\n$$\nP(I) = 1 - (1 - 0.3f)^n\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1 - (1 - 0.3f)^{n}}\n$$", "id": "4818050"}, {"introduction": "The relationship between *T. brucei* and its human host is a dynamic molecular arms race.
