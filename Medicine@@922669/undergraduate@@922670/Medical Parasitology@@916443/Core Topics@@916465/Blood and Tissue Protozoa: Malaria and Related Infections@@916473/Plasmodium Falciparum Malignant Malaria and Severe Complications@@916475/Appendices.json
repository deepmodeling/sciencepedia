The method described—calculating parasitemia from a thin smear count and then estimating absolute parasite density using the patient's red blood cell count—is a standard, accepted procedure in laboratory medicine for managing malaria. The given values for RBC count, hematocrit, and the degree of parasitemia are clinically plausible for a patient with malignant malaria.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data to calculate the two requested quantities. The assumption of one parasite per infected cell is explicitly stated, avoiding ambiguity in the calculation of parasite numbers from infected cell numbers. The objectives are clear and lead to unique solutions.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, quantitative terms, free from subjective language or opinion.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. The provided hematocrit value ($Hct = 30\\%$) is not required for the specified calculations (which use the absolute RBC count), but its presence is realistic as it is part of a standard complete blood count (CBC) report. It serves as clinically relevant context (indicating anemia, a common complication of malaria) rather than a contradiction or an instance of missing information.\n- **Feasibility**: All conditions and data are physically and clinically realistic.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution requires two separate calculations based on fundamental definitions used in parasitology.\n\n**1. Calculation of Parasitemia**\n\nParasitemia ($P$) is defined as the fraction of erythrocytes infected with parasites. It is typically determined from a manual count on a stained blood smear. The formula is:\n$$ P = \\frac{\\text{Number of infected RBCs}}{\\text{Total number of RBCs examined}} $$\nUsing the provided symbols:\n$$ P = \\frac{N_{infected, smear}}{N_{RBC, examined}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ P = \\frac{120}{4,000} $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ P = \\frac{12}{400} = \\frac{3}{100} = 0.03 $$\nThe problem requires this value to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to three significant figures. To express $0.03$ with three significant figures, we write:\n$$ P = 0.0300 $$\n\n**2. Calculation of Parasite Density**\n\nParasite density ($D_p$) is the absolute number of parasites per unit volume of whole blood, typically per microliter (µL). It can be estimated from the parasitemia and the patient's total red blood cell count. The relationship is:\n$$ D_p = P \\times C_{RBC} $$\nThis formula calculates the number of infected RBCs per microliter of blood. Given the problem's explicit assumption of one parasite per infected erythrocyte, the number of parasites per microliter is equal to the number of infected RBCs per microliter.\n\nSubstituting the calculated parasitemia and the given RBC count:\n$$ D_p = 0.03 \\times (4.0 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\text{parasites}/\\mu\\text{L}) $$\nNote that for the calculation, we use the exact value of parasitemia ($0.03$) before rounding.\n$$ D_p = 120,000 \\, \\text{parasites}/\\mu\\text{L} $$\n$$ D_p = 1.2 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\text{parasites}/\\mu\\text{L} $$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to three significant figures. In scientific notation, this is:\n$$ D_p = 1.20 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\text{parasites}/\\mu\\text{L} $$\n\nThe hematocrit value of $30\\%$ was provided but not used in these specific calculations, as the more direct measurement of the patient's absolute red blood cell count ($C_{RBC}$) was available and is the preferred value for this method of density estimation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.0300 & 1.20 \\times 10^{5} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4807726"}, {"introduction": "Once severe malaria is diagnosed, immediate and correctly dosed parenteral antimalarial therapy is essential to prevent mortality.

Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem states that the decline in peripheral parasitemia, $P(t)$, follows a first-order process. A first-order kinetic process is described by the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = -k P(t)\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the first-order rate constant of clearance. The negative sign indicates that the quantity $P(t)$ is decreasing over time.\n\nThis linear first-order ordinary differential equation can be solved by separation of variables and integration:\n$$\n\\int_{P(0)}^{P(t)} \\frac{dP}{P} = \\int_{0}^{t} -k\\,d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(P(t)) - \\ln(P(0)) = -kt\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{P(t)}{P(0)}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the standard equation for first-order decay:\n$$\nP(t) = P(0) \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThe problem provides the parasite clearance half-life, $t_{1/2}$, which is defined as the time required for $P(t)$ to be reduced to half of its value. We can relate the rate constant $k$ to the half-life $t_{1/2}$. By definition, at $t = t_{1/2}$, $P(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}P(0)$. Substituting this into the decay equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} P(0) = P(0) \\exp(-kt_{1/2})\n$$\nDividing by $P(0)$ (which is non-zero):\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-kt_{1/2})\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -kt_{1/2}\n$$\nUsing the property $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$:\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -kt_{1/2}\n$$\nSolving for the rate constant $k$:\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\n$$\nWe are given $t_{1/2} = 5\\,\\mathrm{h}$. Therefore, the rate constant is $k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{5}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n\nNow we can write the specific decay equation for this problem:\n$$\nP(t) = P(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} t\\right)\n$$\nWe need to find the time $t$ at which the parasitemia reaches $P(t) = 0.001$, starting from $P(0) = 0.10$. We substitute these values into the equation:\n$$\n0.001 = 0.10 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{5} t\\right)\n$$\nTo solve for $t$, we first isolate the exponential term by dividing by $P(0)$:\n$$\n\\frac{0.001}{0.10} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{5} t\\right)\n$$\n$$\n0.01 = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{5} t\\right)\n$$\nNext, we take the natural logarithm of both sides to remove the exponential function:\n$$\n\\ln(0.01) = -\\frac{\\ln(2)}{5} t\n$$\nNow, we solve for $t$:\n$$\nt = - \\frac{5 \\ln(0.01)}{\\ln(2)}\n$$\nWe can simplify $\\ln(0.01) = \\ln(10^{-2}) = -2\\ln(10)$. Substituting this into the expression for $t$:\n$$\nt = - \\frac{5 (-2\\ln(10))}{\\ln(2)} = \\frac{10 \\ln(10)}{\\ln(2)}\n$$\nThe problem requires a final numerical answer rounded to four significant figures.
