After the initial inoculation by the Anopheles mosquito, sporozoites reach the liver, undergo exoerythrocytic schizogony, and release merozoites into the bloodstream; thereafter, the blood-stage cycles dominate the within-host dynamics of parasitemia. Define parasitemia $P_{n}$ as the fraction (dimensionless) of RBCs that are infected at the start of discrete cycle $n$ of the erythrocytic stage.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded exercise in mathematical biology. A solution will be formulated.\n\n### Derivation of the Recurrence Relation\nLet $N_{\\text{RBC}}$ be the total number of red blood cells in the host, which is assumed to be a constant.\nThe parasitemia at the start of cycle $n$, $P_{n}$, is defined as the fraction of infected RBCs. Therefore, the absolute number of infected RBCs at the start of cycle $n$ is $P_{n} N_{\\text{RBC}}$.\n\nAt the end of cycle $n$, these infected RBCs rupture. Each of the $P_{n} N_{\\text{RBC}}$ cells releases a mean of $R$ merozoites. The total number of merozoites released into the bloodstream is:\n$$ N_{\\text{merozoites, released}} = (P_{n} N_{\\text{RBC}}) \\times R $$\n\nA fraction $\\delta$ of these merozoites are non-viable or cleared, while the remaining fraction, $1 - \\delta$, survive to invade new RBCs. The number of surviving, invasive merozoites is:\n$$ N_{\\text{merozoites, surviving}} = N_{\\text{merozoites, released}} \\times (1 - \\delta) = R(1 - \\delta) P_{n} N_{\\text{RBC}} $$\n\nAccording to the problem statement, each surviving merozoite successfully infects a single, previously uninfected RBC. Thus, the number of newly infected RBCs that will constitute the infected population for cycle $n+1$ is equal to the number of surviving merozoites:\n$$ N_{\\text{infected, } n+1} = R(1 - \\delta) P_{n} N_{\\text{RBC}} $$\n\nThe parasitemia for the next cycle, $P_{n+1}$, is the ratio of the number of infected RBCs at the start of that cycle to the total number of RBCs:\n$$ P_{n+1} = \\frac{N_{\\text{infected, } n+1}}{N_{\\text{RBC}}} = \\frac{R(1 - \\delta) P_{n} N_{\\text{RBC}}}{N_{\\text{RBC}}} $$\n\nThe term $N_{\\text{RBC}}$ cancels, yielding the discrete-time recurrence relation for parasitemia:\n$$ P_{n+1} = R(1 - \\delta) P_{n} $$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous recurrence relation, which describes geometric growth. The factor $R(1 - \\delta)$ is the net reproductive rate of the parasite per erythrocytic cycle.\n\n### Solution of the Recurrence Relation\nTo find a closed-form expression for $P_{k}$ in terms of the initial parasitemia $P_{0}$, we can solve the recurrence by iteration. Let the growth factor be $\\lambda = R(1 - \\delta)$. The relation is $P_{n+1} = \\lambda P_{n}$.\n\nFor $n=0$:\n$$ P_{1} = \\lambda P_{0} $$\nFor $n=1$:\n$$ P_{2} = \\lambda P_{1} = \\lambda (\\lambda P_{0}) = \\lambda^{2} P_{0} $$\nFor $n=2$:\n$$ P_{3} = \\lambda P_{2} = \\lambda (\\lambda^{2} P_{0}) = \\lambda^{3} P_{0} $$\n\nBy induction, for an arbitrary cycle $k$, the parasitemia is given by:\n$$ P_{k} = \\lambda^{k} P_{0} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\lambda$ back, we obtain the general closed-form solution:\n$$ P_{k} = (R(1 - \\delta))^{k} P_{0} $$\n\n### Evaluation for Specific Parameter Values\nThe problem requires evaluating this expression for $R = 8$ and $\\delta = 0.3$.\nFirst, we calculate the numerical value of the growth factor, $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda = R(1 - \\delta) = 8 \\times (1 - 0.3) = 8 \\times 0.7 = 5.6 $$\nNow, we substitute this value back into the closed-form solution for $P_{k}$:\n$$ P_{k} = (5.6)^{k} P_{0} $$\nThis is the final analytic expression for the parasitemia at cycle $k$, $P_k$, in terms of the initial parasitemia $P_0$ and the cycle number $k$, under the given conditions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{P_{0} (5.6)^{k}}\n$$", "id": "4808786"}, {"introduction": "Malaria transmission is exquisitely sensitive to environmental temperature, a factor that governs the parasite's development within the mosquito.

This quantity is purely entomological and abstracts out the transmission probabilities $b$ and $c$. For this derivation, we effectively set $b=1$ and $c=1$.\n\nLet us consider a single infectious human in a large population of susceptible humans. The ratio of mosquitoes to humans is $m$, so we associate $m$ mosquitoes with this one human. Each mosquito bites at a rate of $a$ bites per day. Thus, the total rate of bites on this one human is $m \\times a$.\n\nSince we abstract out the human-to-mosquito transmission probability $c$, every bite on the infectious human is assumed to infect the mosquito. Therefore, the rate at which new mosquitoes become infected from this single human is $m \\times a$ mosquitoes per day.\n\nLet a mosquito be infected at time $t=0$. It must survive the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of $n$ days to become infectious. The daily survival probability is $p$. The probability of surviving for $n$ days is $p^n$. The continuous-time mortality hazard rate is $\\mu$, related to $p$ by $p = \\exp(-\\mu)$, or $\\mu = -\\ln p$. The probability of surviving for $n$ days is thus $\\exp(-\\mu n) = (\\exp(-\\mu))^n = p^n$.\n\nTo find the vectorial capacity $C$, we can calculate the steady-state number of infectious mosquitoes, $Z_{ss}$, supported by this single infectious human. Let $Z(t)$ be the number of infectious mosquitoes at time $t$. The rate of change of $Z(t)$ is given by the balance between the rate at which mosquitoes become infectious and the rate at which they die.\n$$ \\frac{dZ}{dt} = (\\text{rate of inflow}) - (\\text{rate of outflow}) $$\nThe outflow rate is the death rate of infectious mosquitoes, which is $\\mu Z(t)$.\nThe inflow rate is the rate at which mosquitoes, infected $n$ days ago, complete the EIP and become infectious.
