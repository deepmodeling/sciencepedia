This corresponds to calculating $P(L \\mid T=42, M)$.\n\nWe will use Bayes' theorem for this calculation. Let $k$ represent a cause from the set $\\{L, C, I\\}$. The posterior probability of cause $L$ is given by:\n$$\nP(L \\mid T=t, M) = \\frac{P(T=t, M \\mid L) P(L)}{P(T=t, M)}\n$$\nThe prior probabilities $P(L)$ are given as the mixture weights $w_k$. Thus, $P(L) = w_L$.\n\nThe term $P(T=t, M \\mid L)$ is the likelihood of observing a recurrence at time $t$ with a genotype match, given that the cause is a relapse. A standard assumption in this type of model is that, conditional on the cause, the timing of the recurrence and the genetic outcome are independent events. Therefore, we can write:\n$$\nP(T=t, M \\mid L) = P(T=t \\mid L) P(M \\mid L)\n$$\nThe probability of a continuous variable $T$ being exactly $t$ is zero. Instead, we work with probability density functions (PDFs). The term $P(T=t \\mid L)$ is represented by the PDF $f_L(t)$. So the likelihood term is proportional to $f_L(t) P(M \\mid L)$.\n\nThe denominator, $P(T=t, M)$, is the total probability (or evidence) of the observations, which can be expanded using the law of total probability by summing over all possible causes:\n$$\nP(T=t, M) = \\sum_{k \\in \\{L, C, I\\}} P(T=t, M \\mid k) P(k)\n$$\nApplying the conditional independence assumption for each cause, this becomes:\n$$\nP(T=t, M) \\propto \\sum_{k \\in \\{L, C, I\\}} f_k(t) P(M \\mid k) w_k\n$$\nCombining these elements, the formula for the posterior probability of relapse is:\n$$\nP(L \\mid T=t, M) = \\frac{f_L(t) P(M \\mid L) w_L}{f_L(t) P(M \\mid L) w_L + f_C(t) P(M \\mid C) w_C + f_I(t) P(M \\mid I) w_I}\n$$\nLet's define the numerator and denominator terms as $\\mathcal{L}_k = f_k(t) P(M \\mid k) w_k$ for each cause $k$. The equation is then:\n$$\nP(L \\mid T=t, M) = \\frac{\\mathcal{L}_L}{\\mathcal{L}_L + \\mathcal{L}_C + \\mathcal{L}_I}\n$$\nWe are given $t = 42$.
