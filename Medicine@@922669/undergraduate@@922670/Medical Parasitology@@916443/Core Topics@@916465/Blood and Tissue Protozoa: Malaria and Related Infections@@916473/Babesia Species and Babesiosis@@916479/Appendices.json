The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient, consistent information to determine a unique solution. The language is objective and quantitative. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is developed in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we estimate the expected stage distribution in the specified blood smear field.\nThe total number of RBCs in the field is $N_{RBC} = 500$.\nThe parasitemia, $P$, is given as $1\\%$, or $P = 0.01$.\nThe total number of infected RBCs, $N_{inf}$, in the field is the product of the total RBC count and the parasitemia:\n$$N_{inf} = N_{RBC} \\times P = 500 \\times 0.01 = 5$$\nThe problem states that $10\\%$ of infected RBCs display the tetrad configuration. Let this fraction be $f_{tetrad} = 0.10$.\nThe expected number of infected RBCs in the tetrad stage, $N_{tetrad}$, is:\n$$N_{tetrad} = N_{inf} \\times f_{tetrad} = 5 \\times 0.10 = 0.5$$\nThe remaining infected RBCs are in other, non-tetrad stages of development (e.g., ring or amoeboid forms). Their expected number, $N_{other}$, is:\n$$N_{other} = N_{inf} - N_{tetrad} = 5 - 0.5 = 4.5$$\nThe number of uninfected RBCs, $N_{uninf}$, is:\n$$N_{uninf} = N_{RBC} - N_{inf} = 500 - 5 = 495$$\nThus, the expected stage distribution in the $500$-RBC field is $0.5$ tetrads, $4.5$ other infected stages, and $495$ uninfected RBCs.\n\nSecond, we infer the intrinsic exponential growth rate, $r$. The growth of the infected RBC population, $N(t)$, is modeled by the equation $N(t) = N_{0}\\exp(rt)$, where $N_{0}$ is the initial population size.\n\nLet $T_{cycle}$ be the total duration of the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (from invasion of an RBC to the rupture of the mature form). Let $M$ be the multiplication factor per cycle, defined as the number of newly infected RBCs produced from a single infected RBC at the end of one cycle.\nAfter one cycle time, $t = T_{cycle}$, the population will have grown to $N(T_{cycle}) = N_{0} M$.\nSubstituting this into the growth equation gives:\n$$N_{0} M = N_{0}\\exp(r T_{cycle})$$\n$$M = \\exp(r T_{cycle})$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides and solving for $r$ yields:\n$$r = \\frac{\\ln(M)}{T_{cycle}}$$\nTo calculate $r$, we must determine both $M$ and $T_{cycle}$ from the given data.\n\nWe determine the total cycle time, $T_{cycle}$, using the steady-state assumption. This assumption states that the fraction of the infected population in a given stage, $f_{stage}$, is equal to the ratio of that stage's duration, $T_{stage}$, to the total cycle time, $T_{cycle}$.\n$$f_{stage} = \\frac{T_{stage}}{T_{cycle}}$$\nWe are given the fraction of infected cells in the tetrad stage, $f_{tetrad} = 0.10$, and the duration of this stage, $T_{tetrad} = 3$ hours. We can thus solve for $T_{cycle}$:\n$$T_{cycle} = \\frac{T_{tetrad}}{f_{tetrad}} = \\frac{3 \\text{ hours}}{0.10} = 30 \\text{ hours}$$\n\nNext, we determine the multiplication factor, $M$. This factor represents the number of successful new infections generated from one initial infection over one life cycle. An infected RBC develops into a tetrad, which then ruptures.\nThe number of merozoites released per rupture is given as $m = 4$.\nThe invasion efficiency, $\\eta$, is the probability that a released merozoite successfully invades a new RBC, given as $\\eta = 0.60$.\nThe multiplication factor is the product of the number of merozoites released and their invasion efficiency:\n$$M = m \\times \\eta = 4 \\times 0.60 = 2.4$$\n\nNow we have both $M$ and $T_{cycle}$ and can calculate $r$. The problem requires $r$ to be expressed in units of day$^{-1}$. We must convert $T_{cycle}$ from hours to days.\n$$T_{cycle} = 30 \\text{ hours} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ day}}{24 \\text{ hours}} = \\frac{30}{24} \\text{ days} = 1.25 \\text{ days}$$\nSubstituting the values for $M$ and $T_{cycle}$ into the equation for $r$:\n$$r = \\frac{\\ln(2.4)}{1.25} \\text{ day}^{-1}$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$\\ln(2.4) \\approx 0.87546873735$$\n$$r \\approx \\frac{0.87546873735}{1.25} \\text{ day}^{-1} \\approx 0.70037498988 \\text{ day}^{-1}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$r \\approx 0.7004 \\text{ day}^{-1}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7004}$$", "id": "4781196"}]}
