It is based on the formal rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), which governs the naming of animals, including protozoan parasites. The principles cited for forming family-group names from the stem of a type genus, the use of the genitive case, and the standard suffixes are all correct representations of ICZN articles. The problem is well-posed, providing a clear, self-contained set of rules and a defined objective, leading to a unique, deterministic solution. The language is precise and objective. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not incomplete or contradictory, and is a formalizable_task directly relevant to the field of taxonomy.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution can be constructed by applying the given rules sequentially.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution proceeds by following the nomenclatural rules provided in the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Determine the stem of the type genus, $Leishmania$.**\n    The process begins with the nominative singular form of the type genus, which is given as $Leishmania$.\n    According to the provided rules, for a genus-group name ending in $-ia$, the genitive singular is formed by changing the ending to $-iae$.\n    Therefore, the genitive singular of $Leishmania$ is $Leishmaniae$.\n    The stem is obtained by removing the genitive ending from the genitive singular form. The genitive singular ending for a first-declension Latin noun is $-ae$.\n    Removing the ending $-ae$ from $Leishmaniae$ yields the stem.\n    Stem = $Leishmaniae - ae = Leishmani$.\n    The stem of the genus $Leishmania$ is thus $Leishmani$.\n\n2.  **Form the family-group names.**\n    The names for the family, subfamily, and tribe are formed by adding the appropriate rank-specific suffix to the stem $Leishmani$.\n    -   **Family Name:** The suffix for the family rank is $-idae$.\n        Family name = Stem + $-idae$ = $Leishmani + idae = Leishmaniidae$.\n    -   **Subfamily Name:** The suffix for the subfamily rank is $-inae$.\n        Subfamily name = Stem + $-inae$ = $Leishmani + inae = Leishmaniinae$.\n    -   **Tribe Name:** The suffix for the tribe rank is $-ini$.\n        Tribe name = Stem + $-ini$ = $Leishmani + ini = Leishmaniini$.\n\n3.  **Compute the number of characters for each name.**\n    The function $L(\\cdot)$ counts the number of alphabetic characters in each name.\n    -   $L(\\text{family name}) = L(Leishmaniidae)$. The name $Leishmaniidae$ has $13$ characters.\n    -   $L(\\text{subfamily name}) = L(Leishmaniinae)$. The name $Leishmaniinae$ has $13$ characters.\n    -   $L(\\text{tribe name}) = L(Leishmaniini)$. The name $Leishmaniini$ has $12$ characters.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final sum $S$.**\n    The problem asks for the sum of the character counts of the three names.\n    $$S = L(Leishmaniidae) + L(Leishmaniinae) + L(Leishmaniini)$$\n    Substituting the character counts:\n    $$S = 13 + 13 + 12$$\n    $$S = 38$$\nThe final value of $S$ is $38$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{38}$$", "id": "4810060"}, {"introduction": "As scientific discovery is a global, centuries-long endeavor, it is inevitable that two different species are sometimes given the same name, creating a \"homonym.\" This exercise plunges you into a realistic historical scenario where a taxonomic revision brings two such names into direct conflict [@problem_id:4810002]. By applying the core ICZN principles of priority and homonymy, you will learn to resolve this conflict, understand the difference between senior and junior homonyms, and see why replacement names are essential for ensuring every species has one unique, valid scientific name.", "problem": "Two valid species-group names were established in different genera with the same specific epithet: $\\textit{Taenia minor}$ by Author A in year $y_{1} = 1860$, and $\\textit{Cysticercus minor}$ by Author B in year $y_{2} = 1875$. In year $t = 1900$, new evidence showed that the species described as $\\textit{Cysticercus minor}$ is congeneric with $\\textit{Taenia}$, and the former was accordingly transferred, creating the new combination $\\textit{Taenia minor}$ (Author B, $1875$).

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in the application of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), a foundational framework in biology, including medical parasitology. The scenario is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data are provided and are internally consistent. The problem will be solved by applying the principles defined by the ICZN.\n\nThe core principles of the ICZN relevant to this problem are:\n$1$. **Binomial Nomenclature**: The scientific name of a species is a combination of two names: the generic name (genus) and the specific epithet.\n$2$. **The Principle of Priority**: The valid name for a taxon is the oldest available name applied to it.\n$3$. **The Principle of Homonymy**: Any one name, in its particular spelling, may be used for only one taxon within a particular nomenclatural rank. Among two or more identical names for different taxa, only the senior one (the one published earliest) is valid.\n\nFirst, we must establish whether a homonymy arises and classify it.\nA homonymy occurs when two or more species-group taxa bear the same specific epithet and are placed in the same genus. We are given two species-group names:\n- Name $1$: $\\textit{Taenia minor}$, established by Author A in year $y_{1} = 1860$.\n- Name $2$: $\\textit{Cysticercus minor}$, established by Author B in year $y_{2} = 1875$.\n\nAt the time of their establishment, these two names were in different genera, $\\textit{Taenia}$ and $\\textit{Cysticercus}$. Therefore, in the years from $y_{1}=1860$ to $t=1900$, they were not homonyms, as their full binomial names, $\\textit{Taenia minor}$ and $\\textit{Cysticercus minor}$, are different.\n\nIn year $t = 1900$, the species originally described as $\\textit{Cysticercus minor}$ was transferred to the genus $\\textit{Taenia}$. This action created the new combination $\\textit{Taenia minor}$ (Author B, $1875$). At this point, two distinct taxa are referred to by the identical binomial name $\\textit{Taenia minor}$:\n- Taxon $1$: $\\textit{Taenia minor}$ (Author A, $1860$)\n- Taxon $2$: $\\textit{Taenia minor}$ (Author B, $1875$)\n\nThis constitutes a homonymy. The ICZN distinguishes between two types of homonymy:\n- **Primary homonymy**: Exists when two identical species-group names are established in the same original genus.\n- **Secondary homonymy**: Exists when two identical species-group names, originally established in different genera, are subsequently placed in the same genus.\n\nIn this case, the homonymy was not present at the time of original publication but arose only upon the transfer of one species into the genus of the other. Therefore, this is a case of **secondary homonymy**.\n\nSecond, we must identify the senior and junior homonyms.\nThe Principle of Priority dictates that the validity and seniority of a name are determined by its date of publication. The dates of publication for the specific epithets are retained, even when they are transferred to a new genus.\n- The name $\\textit{Taenia minor}$ (Author A) was published in $y_{1} = 1860$.\n- The name $\\textit{Cysticercus minor}$ (Author B) was published in $y_{2} = 1875$.\n\nSince $y_{1} < y_{2}$ (i.e., $1860 < 1875$), the name established by Author A is the older one.\n- **Senior homonym**: $\\textit{Taenia minor}$ (Author A, $1860$). This name is valid.\n- **Junior homonym**: $\\textit{Taenia minor}$ (Author B, $1875$). This name is invalid according to the Principle of Homonymy.\n\nThe junior homonym must be rejected and replaced to avoid confusion and ensure that each taxon has a unique name. Thus, a new replacement name (`nomen novum`) is required for the species originally described as $\\textit{Cysticercus minor}$ by Author B in $1875$.\n\nThird, we will argue for the appropriateness of the replacement name.\nThe proposed replacement name is $\\textit{Taenia parvulus}$ (Author C, $1902$). This is an appropriate solution for the following reasons:\n- It resolves the homonymy by providing a new, unique specific epithet, `parvulus`, for the junior homonym. The resulting binomial name, $\\textit{Taenia parvulus}$, is distinct from the senior homonym, $\\textit{Taenia minor}$.\n- The authorship of the replacement name is correctly attributed to its proposer, Author C, and its date is the date of its publication, $r = 1902$.\n- A crucial aspect of a `nomen novum` is that it is a new name for a pre-existing taxon; it does not represent a new taxonomic discovery. Therefore, the name-bearing type of the replacement name is, by definition, the same as the name-bearing type of the name it replaces. In this instance, the type specimen(s) for $\\textit{Taenia parvulus}$ (Author C, $1902$) are the same as those designated for the original name, $\\textit{Cysticercus minor}$ (Author B, $1875$). This maintains nomenclatural stability and links the new name to the original biological entity.\n\nFinally, we compute the priority margin $\\Delta$.\nThe priority margin is defined as the difference in the publication years of the two specific epithets.\n$$ \\Delta = y_{2} - y_{1} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ y_{1} = 1860 $$\n$$ y_{2} = 1875 $$\nThe calculation is:\n$$ \\Delta = 1875 - 1860 = 15 $$\nThe priority margin is $15$ years.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{15}$$", "id": "4810002"}, {"introduction": "The rapid pace of digital communication has transformed scientific publishing, but it also poses challenges to the stability and formality of zoological nomenclature.

The fact that the preprint server \"allows versioning and replacement of files\" fundamentally compromises this requirement. A non-final, replaceable document cannot be considered a permanent record for nomenclatural purposes.\n    *   Conclusion: The name proposed in the $2021$ preprint is not an \"available name\". It has no formal standing in zoological nomenclature.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the $2023$ Peer-Reviewed Publication:**\n    *   The article was published electronically in the year $2023$, which is after $2012$.\n    *   According to Rule 3, it must show evidence of ZooBank registration. The problem states it \"explicitly states ZooBank registration with a Life Science Identifier (LSID)\". This condition is met.\n    *   According to Rule 2, it must be a \"permanent public record\". The problem states it was published in a journal with an ISSN and is \"permanently archived\". This condition is met.\n    *   The publication also contains a diagnosis and holotype information, which are necessary components for establishing a new species-group name.\n    *   Conclusion: The $2023$ publication fulfills all the stated requirements to be considered a \"work\" that makes the name \"available\".\n\n3.  **Application of the Principle of Priority and Consideration of the Spelling:**\n    *   According to Rule 4, the \"Principle of Priority applies only among available names\".\n    *   Since the name in the $2021$ preprint is not available, there is no conflict of priority. The first and only available name is the one published in $2023$.\n    *   The available name is therefore the one that appeared in the $2023$ work. This includes its specific spelling (the \"corrected Latinized epithet\"), its authorship (the authors of the $2023$ paper), and its date of publication ($2023$). The incorrect spelling in the unavailable $2021$ preprint is irrelevant from a nomenclatural standpoint.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **A. The $2021$ preprint makes the name available because it has a DOI and includes a holotype designation.**\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.** This option ignores the explicit and mandatory requirement for ZooBank registration for electronic publications after $2012$ (Rule 3). A DOI and holotype are necessary but not sufficient. The preprint fails on this crucial point, as well as on the requirement of being a permanent record (Rule 2).\n\n*   **B. Neither version makes the name available because the epithet was changed between $2021$ and $2023$.**\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.** The analysis shows that the $2023$ version *does* make the name available, as it meets all stated criteria. The change in the epithet is a correction of an error made in a nomenclaturally non-binding document (the preprint). This correction does not invalidate the subsequent, compliant publication.\n\n*   **C. Only the $2023$ peer-reviewed publication makes the name available, and the available name bears authorship and date of $2023$ under the corrected epithet.**\n    **Verdict: Correct.** This statement accurately reflects the logical consequences of the provided rules. The $2021$ preprint is nomenclaturally unavailable for failing to meet the requirements for electronic publication. The $2023$ article is the first publication to satisfy all conditions for availability. Consequently, the date, authorship, and spelling of the name are fixed by this $2023$ publication.\n\n*   **D. Both versions make names available, creating simultaneous availability of two spellings that must be settled by the Principle of the First Reviser.**\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.** This is false because the $2021$ preprint did not make the name available. The Principle of the First Reviser is invoked to resolve conflicts between two or more *available* names or spellings, which is not the case here.
