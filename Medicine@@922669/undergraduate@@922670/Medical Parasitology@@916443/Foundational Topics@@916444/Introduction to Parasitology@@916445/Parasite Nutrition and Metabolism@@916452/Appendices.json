It is scientifically grounded in the principles of biochemical kinetics, specifically the Michaelis-Menten model for enzyme or transporter activity. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and assumptions to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and the values provided are biologically plausible.\n\nThe first part of the task is to derive the functional dependence of the PfHT1-mediated glucose uptake rate, $V$, on the extracellular glucose concentration, $[G]$. The problem specifies that the system can be modeled by the classical enzyme–substrate framework, with the transporter, $T$, binding to the substrate, glucose $G$, to form a complex, $TG$. This complex then facilitates the transport of glucose into the cell. The process is described by the following kinetic scheme:\n\n$$\nT + G \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} TG \\stackrel{k_{cat}}{\\longrightarrow} T + G_{\\text{in}}\n$$\n\nHere, $T$ represents the free PfHT1 transporter, $G$ is the extracellular glucose, $TG$ is the transporter-glucose complex, and $G_{\\text{in}}$ is the intracellular glucose. The rate constants for the association, dissociation, and catalytic (turnover) steps are $k_1$, $k_{-1}$, and $k_{cat}$, respectively. The problem states that intracellular glucose is rapidly consumed, implying the reverse transport step is negligible.\n\nThe rate of formation of the transporter-glucose complex, $[TG]$, is given by:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of formation} = k_1 [T][G]\n$$\nThe rate of breakdown of the $[TG]$ complex is the sum of the rates of dissociation back to $T$ and $G$, and the turnover to release $G_{\\text{in}}$:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of breakdown} = k_{-1} [TG] + k_{cat} [TG] = (k_{-1} + k_{cat})[TG]\n$$\nThe problem requires the use of the steady-state approximation, which assumes that the concentration of the intermediate complex, $[TG]$, remains constant over time. Therefore, its rate of change is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d[TG]}{dt} = 0\n$$\nThis implies that the rate of formation of $[TG]$ must equal its rate of breakdown:\n$$\nk_1 [T][G] = (k_{-1} + k_{cat})[TG]\n$$\nThe total concentration of the transporter, $[T]_{\\text{total}}$, is constant and is the sum of the free transporter, $[T]$, and the bound transporter, $[TG]$:\n$$\n[T]_{\\text{total}} = [T] + [TG]\n$$\nFrom this conservation equation, we can express the concentration of free transporter as:\n$$\n[T] = [T]_{\\text{total}} - [TG]\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $[T]$ into the steady-state equation:\n$$\nk_1 ([T]_{\\text{total}} - [TG])[G] = (k_{-1} + k_{cat})[TG]\n$$\nOur goal is to solve for $[TG]$ in terms of known quantities.

The stoichiometric relationships provided for glycolysis and homolactic fermentation are correct. The problem is well-posed, as all necessary data for the calculation are provided.

We are given that a fraction $f_{\\text{C}} = 0.90$ of the carbon from consumed glucose is converted into lactate.\n\nFirst, we determine the rate of carbon consumption. The chemical formula for glucose is $\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{12}\\text{O}_6$, so each mole of glucose contains $6$ moles of carbon atoms. The rate of carbon consumption, $r_{\\text{C,c}}$, is:\n$$r_{\\text{C,c}} = r_{\\text{G,c}} \\times (\\text{number of C atoms in glucose})$$\n$$r_{\\text{C,c}} = (2 \\ \\mathrm{mmol}\\ \\mathrm{glucose}\\ \\mathrm{gDW}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{hr}^{-1}) \\times (6 \\ \\mathrm{mmol}\\ \\text{C} / \\mathrm{mmol}\\ \\mathrm{glucose})$$\n$$r_{\\text{C,c}} = 12 \\ \\mathrm{mmol}\\ \\text{C}\\ \\mathrm{gDW}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{hr}^{-1}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the rate at which this carbon is incorporated into lactate.
