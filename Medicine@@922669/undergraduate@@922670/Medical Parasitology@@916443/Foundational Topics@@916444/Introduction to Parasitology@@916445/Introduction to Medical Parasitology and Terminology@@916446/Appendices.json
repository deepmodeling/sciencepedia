The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary parameters are provided.\n\nFirst, we must formally define the events and probabilities based on the information given in the problem statement.\nLet $D$ represent the event that a febrile patient has patent *Plasmodium falciparum* parasitemia (i.e., truly has malaria).\nLet $D^c$ represent the complementary event that the patient does not have malaria.\nLet $T^+$ represent the event that the new rapid diagnostic test (RDT) yields a positive result.\nLet $T^-$ represent the event that the RDT yields a negative result.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\nThe baseline probability of the disease, or prevalence, is given as $P(D) = 0.12$.\nThe probability of a patient not having the disease is the complement of the prevalence:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.12 = 0.88$$\n\nThe sensitivity of the RDT is the true positive rate, defined as the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease:\n$$P(T^+ | D) = 0.92$$\n\nThe specificity of the RDT is the true negative rate, defined as the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease:\n$$P(T^- | D^c) = 0.95$$\n\nThe problem asks for the positive predictive value (PPV), which is defined as the probability that a patient truly has malaria given a positive RDT result. In probabilistic terms, this is the conditional probability $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nTo derive the expression for $P(D | T^+)$, we use Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe numerator contains terms that are directly given: the sensitivity $P(T^+ | D)$ and the prevalence $P(D)$.\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. This can occur in two mutually exclusive ways: either the patient has the disease and tests positive (a true positive), or the patient does not have the disease and tests positive (a false positive). We can express $P(T^+)$ using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A | B) P(B)$, we can rewrite this as:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nThe first term, $P(T^+ | D) P(D)$, is the probability of a true positive in the population. The second term requires $P(T^+ | D^c)$, the false positive rate. The false positive rate is the complement of the specificity (the true negative rate):\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the complete expression for $P(T^+)$ back into the Bayes' theorem formula. This yields the full derived expression for the PPV:\n$$PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)}$$\nThis expression relates the PPV to the core parameters of sensitivity ($P(T^+ | D)$), prevalence ($P(D)$), and specificity (via its complement, $P(T^+ | D^c) = 1-P(T^-|D^c)$).\n\nWith the expression derived, we can compute its numerical value by substituting the given data:\n$$PPV = \\frac{(0.92)(0.12)}{(0.92)(0.12) + (0.05)(0.88)}$$\nFirst, we calculate the individual terms:\nThe numerator (probability of a true positive):\n$$(0.92)(0.12) = 0.1104$$\nThe second term in the denominator (probability of a false positive):\n$$(0.05)(0.88) = 0.044$$\nNow, substitute these values back into the equation:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.1104}{0.1104 + 0.044} = \\frac{0.1104}{0.1544}$$\nPerforming the final division:\n$$PPV \\approx 0.7150259067...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $7$, $1$, $5$, and $0$. The fifth digit is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., we do not change the fourth digit).\nTherefore, the computed value for the PPV is $0.7150$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7150}$$", "id": "4795372"}, {"introduction": "Measuring the impact of public health interventions is essential for optimizing control strategies against parasitic diseases.
