Two clinically important examples are tissue cysts of Toxoplasma gondii in pork and cysticerci of Taenia saginata in beef. Cooking can interrupt this transmission route by thermally inactivating the parasites embedded in muscle. Assume the following foundational, widely accepted facts from thermal death kinetics and food parasitology:\n\n- At a constant temperature, the inactivation of viable parasites follows first-order kinetics with respect to the viable count, such that a decimal reduction time (the $D$-value) at temperature $T$, denoted $D(T)$, is the time required at temperature $T$ to reduce the viable population by a factor of $10$.\n- The temperature dependence of the $D$-value can be modeled by the Bigelow relationship: $\\log_{10} D(T) = \\log_{10} D(T_{\\mathrm{ref}}) - \\dfrac{T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{z}$, where $T$ and $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ are absolute cooking temperatures expressed in $\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and $z$ is the temperature increase in $\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ required to reduce $D$ by one log cycle.\n\nSuppose you are given the following empirically determined parameters, which are valid for the thermal center of intact muscle under isothermal conditions:\n\n- For Toxoplasma gondii tissue cysts in pork: $D(56\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) = 0.40\\,\\text{min}$ and $z = 5.5\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n- For Taenia saginata cysticerci in beef: $D(60\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) = 1.00\\,\\text{min}$ and $z = 7.0\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nA public health performance target is to achieve at least a $6$-log reduction for Toxoplasma gondii in pork and at least a $5$-log reduction for Taenia saginata in beef at the thermal center.

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Solution Derivation**\n\nThe total log reduction achieved by the treatment train is the sum of the log reductions of the individual, independent, serial steps.\nLet $k_{total}$ be the total log reduction.\n$$k_{total} = k_{cs} + k_{sf} + k_{uv}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$k_{total} = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6$$\nThis corresponds to a $6$-log total reduction of oocysts.\n\nThe final concentration of oocysts in the treated tap water, $C_{final}$, is the initial concentration, $C_{0}$, multiplied by the total reduction factor, which is defined as $10^{-k_{total}}$.\n$$C_{final} = C_{0} \\times 10^{-k_{total}}$$\nSubstituting the values for $C_{0}$ and $k_{total}$:\n$$C_{final} = (50\\,\\text{oocysts/L}) \\times 10^{-6} = 5.0 \\times 10^{1} \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{oocysts/L} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{oocysts/L}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the average daily dose, $d$, of oocysts ingested by the consumer. The dose is the product of the final concentration in the water and the volume of water consumed.\n$$d = C_{final} \\times V$$\nSubstituting the calculated $C_{final}$ and the given $V$:\n$$d = (5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{oocysts/L}) \\times (2.0\\,\\text{L})$$\n$$d = 10.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{oocysts} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{oocysts}$$\nThis represents the mean number of oocysts ingested per day.\n\nFinally, we use the exponential dose-response model to find the daily probability of infection, $P_{inf}$. The model is given by:\n$$P_{inf} = 1 - \\exp(-r \\cdot d)$$\nwhere $d$ is the dose and $r$ is the infectivity parameter.\nSubstituting the values for $r$ and $d$:\n$$r = 0.0042 = 4.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{per oocyst}$$\n$$d = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{oocysts}$$\nThe argument of the exponential function is:\n$$r \\cdot d = (4.2 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-4}) = 4.2 \\times 10^{-7}$$\nThis value is unitless, as required.\n\nThe probability of infection is then:\n$$P_{inf} = 1 - \\exp(-4.2 \\times 10^{-7})$$\nSince the argument of the exponential, $x = -4.2 \\times 10^{-7}$, is very close to zero ($|x| \\ll 1$), we can use the first-order Taylor series approximation $\\exp(x) \\approx 1 + x$.\n$$P_{inf} \\approx 1 - (1 - 4.2 \\times 10^{-7}) = 4.2 \\times 10^{-7}$$\nCalculating the full expression confirms this approximation is highly accurate:\n$$P_{inf} = 1 - \\exp(-0.00000042) \\approx 1 - 0.999999580000088...$$\n$$P_{inf} \\approx 4.1999991199... \\times 10^{-7}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to two significant figures.\n$$P_{inf} \\approx 4.2 \\times 10^{-7}$$\nThis represents the daily probability of infection for a consumer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.2 \\times 10^{-7}}$$", "id": "4798918"}]}
