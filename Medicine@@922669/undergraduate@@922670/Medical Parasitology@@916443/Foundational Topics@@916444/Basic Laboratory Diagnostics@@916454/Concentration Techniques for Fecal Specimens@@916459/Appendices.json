The use of flotation solutions with specific specific gravities to separate biological particles like helminth eggs is a standard and well-established technique in diagnostic parasitology. The given SG values for Sheather's solution and for *Taenia* and *Trichuris* eggs are consistent with values reported in scientific literature and clinical manuals.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data (SGs of the objects and the surrounding fluids) to determine the outcome (flotation or sedimentation). The question asks for a prediction based on these data, for which a unique solution can be derived.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and objective language (e.g., \"Specific Gravity\", numerical values). It avoids ambiguity and subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution can be derived from first principles.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\nThe principle governing flotation is a comparison between the buoyant force acting on an object and the gravitational force (weight) of that object. According to Archimedes' principle, the buoyant force ($F_B$) is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. The weight of the object ($W_{obj}$) is the product of its mass and the acceleration due to gravity ($g$).\n\nLet $V_{obj}$ be the volume of an egg.\nThe weight of the egg is $W_{obj} = m_{obj}g = (\\rho_{obj} V_{obj})g$, where $\\rho_{obj}$ is the density of the egg.\nThe buoyant force exerted by the fluid is $F_B = W_{displaced\\_fluid} = (\\rho_{fluid} V_{obj})g$, where $\\rho_{fluid}$ is the density of the flotation medium.\n\nAn object will float (experience a net upward force) if the buoyant force is greater than its weight:\n$F_B > W_{obj}$\n$(\\rho_{fluid} V_{obj})g > (\\rho_{obj} V_{obj})g$\n$\\rho_{fluid} > \\rho_{obj}$\n\nAn object will sink (experience a net downward force) if its weight is greater than the buoyant force:\n$W_{obj} > F_B$\n$\\rho_{obj} > \\rho_{fluid}$\n\nSpecific Gravity ($SG$) is defined as the ratio of a substance's density to the density of a reference substance (water, $\\rho_{water}$). Thus, $SG = \\rho / \\rho_{water}$. Since $\\rho_{water}$ is a positive constant, the condition for flotation, $\\rho_{fluid} > \\rho_{obj}$, is equivalent to $SG_{fluid} > SG_{obj}$. Sinking occurs if $SG_{obj} > SG_{fluid}$.\n\nWe will now apply this principle to the two scenarios described in the problem.\n\n**Scenario 1: Undiluted Sheather’s Sugar Medium ($SG_{medium, initial} = 1.27$)**\n- **Taenia eggs ($SG_{Taenia} = 1.23$)**: We compare the SG of the medium to the SG of the egg.\n  $SG_{medium, initial} = 1.27$\n  $SG_{Taenia} = 1.23$\n  Since $1.27 > 1.23$ ($SG_{medium, initial} > SG_{Taenia}$), the Taenia eggs will float.\n- **Trichuris eggs ($SG_{Trichuris} = 1.15$)**: We compare the SG of the medium to the SG of the egg.\n  $SG_{medium, initial} = 1.27$\n  $SG_{Trichuris} = 1.15$\n  Since $1.27 > 1.15$ ($SG_{medium, initial} > SG_{Trichuris}$), the Trichuris eggs will also float.\n- **Conclusion for Scenario 1**: In the standard Sheather's sugar solution with $SG=1.27$, both Taenia and Trichuris eggs are less dense than the medium and will float to the surface, allowing for their recovery at the coverslip.\n\n**Scenario 2: Diluted Medium ($SG_{medium, effective} = 1.20$)**\n- **Taenia eggs ($SG_{Taenia} = 1.23$)**: We compare the SG of the diluted medium to the SG of the egg.\n  $SG_{medium, effective} = 1.20$\n  $SG_{Taenia} = 1.23$\n  Since $1.20  1.23$ ($SG_{medium, effective}  SG_{Taenia}$), the Taenia eggs will sink. Recovery by flotation will be significantly reduced or impossible.\n- **Trichuris eggs ($SG_{Trichuris} = 1.15$)**: We compare the SG of the diluted medium to the SG of the egg.\n  $SG_{medium, effective} = 1.20$\n  $SG_{Trichuris} = 1.15$\n  Since $1.20 > 1.15$ ($SG_{medium, effective} > SG_{Trichuris}$), the Trichuris eggs will continue to float.\n- **Conclusion for Scenario 2**: In the diluted medium with $SG=1.20$, Trichuris eggs will still float, but Taenia eggs, being denser than the medium, will sink.\n\n**Summary of Predictions**:\n- In the $SG=1.27$ solution, both egg types float.\n- In the $SG=1.20$ solution, Trichuris eggs float, but Taenia eggs sink.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. In Sheather’s sugar at SG $1.27$, both Taenia and Trichuris eggs float to the meniscus; when diluted to SG $1.20$, Trichuris continues to float, but Taenia tends to sink, decreasing recovery by flotation.**\n- This statement accurately describes the outcomes derived from our analysis. In the initial solution ($SG=1.27$), both eggs float as $1.27 > 1.23$ and $1.27 > 1.15$. In the diluted solution ($SG=1.20$), Trichuris continues to float as $1.20 > 1.15$, but Taenia sinks as $1.20  1.23$.\n- **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. In Sheather’s sugar at SG $1.27$, only Trichuris floats; when diluted to SG $1.20$, both sink.**\n- The first part is incorrect. Taenia eggs also float in the $SG=1.27$ solution. The second part is also incorrect. Trichuris eggs float in the $SG=1.20$ solution.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. In Sheather’s sugar at SG $1.27$, both sink; when diluted to SG $1.20$, only Taenia floats because heavier eggs experience greater buoyancy.**\n- The first part is incorrect. Both eggs float in the $SG=1.27$ solution. The second part is doubly incorrect: Taenia eggs sink in the $SG=1.20$ solution, and the provided reasoning (\"heavier eggs experience greater buoyancy\") is physically false. Buoyant force depends on displaced volume, not the object's weight. A heavier (denser) object of the same size is *less* buoyant.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Flotation recovery is essentially independent of SG within this range; both eggs float equally in both conditions.**\n- This is incorrect. The analysis clearly shows that the outcome for Taenia eggs is critically dependent on the SG of the medium in this range. A change from $SG=1.27$ to $SG=1.20$ reverses the outcome for Taenia eggs from flotation to sedimentation.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4782818"}, {"introduction": "While flotation lifts parasites up, sedimentation techniques use centrifugal force to pellet them at the bottom of a tube.

It describes a standard laboratory procedure in medical parasitology and requires a calculation based on fundamental principles of circular motion, followed by a biophysical explanation. All necessary data are provided and are consistent. Therefore, a complete solution can be derived. The solution involves three parts: deriving the analytic expression for the centrifuge speed in rotations per minute (rpm), calculating its numerical value, and explaining the physical and biological implications of the specified Relative Centrifugal Force (RCF).\n\nFirst, we derive the analytic expression for the required speed in rpm, denoted by $N$. The Relative Centrifugal Force (RCF) is defined as the ratio of the centripetal acceleration, $a_c$, to the standard gravitational acceleration, $g$.\n$$\n\\text{RCF} = \\frac{a_c}{g}\n$$\nThe problem states that the desired RCF is $500$ times the force of gravity, which means the value of this ratio is $500$.\n$$\n\\frac{a_c}{g} = 500\n$$\nThe centripetal acceleration of an object in a circular path is given by $a_c = \\omega^2 r$, where $\\omega$ is the angular speed in radians per second and $r$ is the radius of the circular path.\n$$\na_c = \\omega^2 r\n$$\nSubstituting this into the RCF expression gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\omega^2 r}{g} = 500\n$$\nThe angular speed $\\omega$ must be related to the rotational speed $N$ in rpm. One revolution corresponds to $2\\pi$ radians, and one minute is equal to $60$ seconds. Therefore, the conversion is:\n$$\n\\omega \\, (\\text{rad/s}) = N \\, (\\text{rpm}) \\times \\frac{2\\pi \\, \\text{rad}}{1 \\, \\text{rev}} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{min}}{60 \\, \\text{s}} = \\frac{2\\pi N}{60} = \\frac{\\pi N}{30}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\omega$ into the RCF equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\pi N}{30}\\right)^2 r}{g} = 500\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi^2 N^2 r}{900 g} = 500\n$$\nWe can now solve for $N$ to obtain the analytic expression for the required rpm:\n$$\nN^2 = \\frac{500 \\times 900 g}{\\pi^2 r}\n$$\n$$\nN = \\sqrt{\\frac{450000 g}{\\pi^2 r}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{450000}}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{r}} = \\frac{30 \\sqrt{50}}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{r}}\n$$\nA more general form using a variable for the RCF value (let's call it $RCF_{val}$) is:\n$$\nN = \\sqrt{\\frac{RCF_{val} \\times 900 g}{\\pi^2 r}} = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{RCF_{val} \\times g}{r}}\n$$\nThis is the required analytic expression.\n\nSecond, we compute the numerical value for $N$ using the provided constants: $r = 0.12 \\, \\mathrm{m}$ and $g = 9.80665 \\, \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$. The specified RCF value is $500$.\n$$\nN = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{500 \\times 9.80665 \\, \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}}{0.12 \\, \\mathrm{m}}}\n$$\n$$\nN = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{4903.325}{0.12} \\, \\mathrm{s^{-2}}}\n$$\n$$\nN = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{40861.04167 \\, \\mathrm{s^{-2}}}\n$$\n$$\nN \\approx \\frac{30}{\\pi} (202.14114 \\, \\mathrm{s^{-1}})\n$$\n$$\nN \\approx 9.549296 \\times 202.14114 \\, \\mathrm{min^{-1}} \\approx 1930.34 \\, \\mathrm{min^{-1}}\n$$\nThe speed is in rotations per minute, so the units are correct. Rounding the result to three significant figures gives:\n$$\nN \\approx 1930 \\, \\mathrm{rpm}\n$$\n\nThird, we explain from first principles how this RCF affects pellet compaction and recovery. The fundamental principle governing the sedimentation of particles in a fluid is Stokes' Law. For a particle in a centrifugal field, the sedimentation velocity, $v_s$, is given by:\n$$\nv_s = \\frac{d^2 (\\rho_p - \\rho_f) a_c}{18 \\eta}\n$$\nwhere $d$ is the particle diameter, $\\rho_p$ is the particle density, $\\rho_f$ is the fluid density, $\\eta$ is the fluid's dynamic viscosity, and $a_c$ is the centripetal acceleration ($a_c = RCF \\times g$).\n\nThis equation reveals that the sedimentation velocity is directly proportional to the applied acceleration ($a_c$). The choice of RCF is therefore a critical parameter that must be optimized to balance two competing requirements: recovery efficiency and sample integrity.\n\n1.  **Pellet Compaction and Sample Integrity**: A higher RCF results in a greater sedimentation velocity and a larger force compacting particles into the pellet at the bottom of the centrifuge tube.\n    *   **If RCF is too high (e.g., > $1000 \\times g$):** This leads to overcompaction. The pellet becomes very hard and dense. Resuspending this pellet for microscopic analysis becomes difficult, which may result in diagnostic stages (eggs, cysts) being trapped and lost within the packed fecal debris. Furthermore, excessive force can damage or lyse fragile protozoan cysts (e.g., *Giardia lamblia*, *Dientamoeba fragilis*), distorting their morphology and rendering them unidentifiable. This reduces diagnostic sensitivity.\n    *   **If RCF is too low (e.g.,  $300 \\times g$):** Sedimentation is inefficient. The force may be insufficient to pellet all diagnostic stages within the given centrifugation time, especially for smaller or less dense cysts. Parasites may remain in the supernatant, which is discarded, leading to a low recovery rate and a high probability of a false-negative result. The resulting pellet is often loose and easily disturbed.\n\n2.  **Recovery of Diagnostic Stages**: The primary goal is to separate the denser parasites from the less dense components of the fecal suspension. Helminth eggs and protozoan cysts generally have a higher specific gravity (e.g., $\\approx 1.06-1.20$) than the aqueous formalin solution (specific gravity $\\approx 1.0$). The ethyl acetate layer removes fats and lipids (which are less dense and float), further cleaning the sample.\n    *   The RCF of $500 \\times g$ is an empirically established optimum. It provides sufficient force to efficiently sediment the target parasites in a reasonable time (typically $1-10$ minutes), maximizing the number of parasites recovered in the pellet. At the same time, it is gentle enough to prevent the overcompaction and organism damage associated with higher forces. This balance maximizes the probability of detecting parasites if they are present (high sensitivity) while preserving their morphology for accurate identification (high specificity).\n\nIn summary, the specified RCF of $500 \\times g$ is not an arbitrary value but a carefully chosen compromise, grounded in the physics of sedimentation, to maximize the recovery of intact, identifiable parasites from a complex biological sample.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1930}$$", "id": "4782864"}, {"introduction": "An effective concentration technique is not just about separating parasites, but about doing so efficiently.
