The diagnostic strategy of collecting multiple stool samples on non-consecutive days to increase the overall sensitivity of detection is standard practice in medical parasitology. The concept of test sensitivity and the assumption of independence for spaced-out biological samples are core principles in biostatistics and epidemiology.

The question asks for a specific, computable probability. A unique and stable solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, precise language. All terms like \"sensitivity\" and \"statistical independence\" have clear, unambiguous definitions in this context.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nLet $s$ be the per-specimen sensitivity of the assay. By definition, sensitivity is the probability that a single test on a specimen from an infected individual will be positive.\n$$P(\\text{positive test} | \\text{infected}) = s$$\nThe given value is $s = 0.65$.\n\nWe have $n=3$ specimens collected on non-consecutive days. Let $E$ be the event that at least one of the three specimens tests positive. It is often easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event, $E^c$, which is the event that *none* of the specimens test positive (i.e., all three tests are negative). The probability of $E$ can then be found using the rule of complementary events:\n$$P(E) = 1 - P(E^c)$$\n\nLet's first determine the probability of a single specimen testing negative. This is the complement of a single specimen testing positive.\n$$P(\\text{negative test} | \\text{infected}) = 1 - P(\\text{positive test} | \\text{infected}) = 1 - s$$\nFor the given sensitivity, this probability is $1 - 0.65 = 0.35$.\n\nThe event $E^c$ is the conjunction of three individual events: the first test is negative, AND the second test is negative, AND the third test is negative. The problem statement specifies that the outcomes of the tests on non-consecutive days should be treated as statistically independent. For independent events, the probability of their conjunction is the product of their individual probabilities.\n$$P(E^c) = P(\\text{1st is negative}) \\times P(\\text{2nd is negative}) \\times P(\\text{3rd is negative})$$\nSince the probability of any single test being negative is $(1 - s)$, we have:\n$$P(E^c) = (1 - s) \\times (1 - s) \\times (1 - s) = (1 - s)^3$$\nThis part of the derivation uses the definition of independence for repeated trials.\n\nNow we can derive the expression for $P(E)$, the probability of at least one positive test, by substituting the expression for $P(E^c)$ into the complement rule equation.\n$$P(\\text{at least one positive}) = 1 - (1 - s)^3$$\nThis formula has been derived using only the fundamental principles specified in the problem statement.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value using the given sensitivity $s = 0.65$.\n$$P(\\text{at least one positive}) = 1 - (1 - 0.65)^3$$\n$$P(\\text{at least one positive}) = 1 - (0.35)^3$$\nWe calculate the value of $(0.35)^3$:\n$$(0.35)^3 = 0.35 \\times 0.35 \\times 0.35 = 0.1225 \\times 0.35 = 0.042875$$\nFinally, we substitute this back into the equation:\n$$P(\\text{at least one positive}) = 1 - 0.042875 = 0.957125$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.

The fifth significant figure is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (truncate).\n$$0.957125 \\approx 0.9571$$\nThus, the probability that at least one of the three specimens will test positive in an infected patient is approximately $0.9571$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9571}$$", "id": "4813176"}, {"introduction": "Once a high-quality specimen is received, quantifying the parasite load is a critical task for assessing infection intensity and guiding treatment.

A solution will now be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe problem asks to first derive a general expression for converting a mean egg count from a sample of mass $m$ (in milligrams) into units of Eggs Per Gram (EPG).\n\nLet $\\bar{E}$ be the mean number of eggs counted across the $n$ replicates. Let $m$ be the mass of the stool sample on each slide in milligrams (mg). The mean egg density measured from the slides is the mean number of eggs divided by the mass of the sample:\n$$ \\text{Density}_{\\text{measured}} = \\frac{\\bar{E}}{m} $$\nThe units of this quantity are $\\frac{\\text{eggs}}{\\text{mg}}$.\n\nThe target quantity, EPG, has units of $\\frac{\\text{eggs}}{\\text{gram}}$.

First, we compute the mean egg count, $\\bar{E}$, from the three replicate counts $E_{1}=12$, $E_{2}=17$, and $E_{3}=16$.\n$$ \\bar{E} = \\frac{E_{1} + E_{2} + E_{3}}{n} = \\frac{12 + 17 + 16}{3} $$\n$$ \\bar{E} = \\frac{45}{3} = 15 $$\nThe mean egg count per slide is $15$.\n\nNow, we substitute the values of $\\bar{E}$ and $m$ into the derived EPG formula.
