Consider that you are using a compound light microscope at a total magnification of $400\\times$.

The stage micrometer (SM) provides a physical reference, while the ocular micrometer (OM) in the eyepiece provides an arbitrary scale whose divisions must be related to true length.\n\nStarting from the definitions that the stage micrometer divisions represent known physical lengths and that magnification linearly scales apparent lengths without altering ratios of aligned scales in the same image plane, you align the zero of the OM with the zero of the SM.

This factor, denoted by $C$, represents the true physical length corresponding to one division on the ocular micrometer scale. The calibration is performed by comparing the arbitrary scale of the OM to the known, fixed scale of a stage micrometer (SM).\n\nFirst, we must establish the physical length of a single division on the stage micrometer. The problem states that the stage micrometer has a total length, $L_{SM}$, of $1\\ \\text{mm}$ and is subdivided into $N_{SM} = 100$ equal divisions. The length of one stage micrometer division, $l_{SMD}$, is therefore given by the ratio:\n$$l_{SMD} = \\frac{L_{SM}}{N_{SM}} = \\frac{1\\ \\text{mm}}{100} = 0.01\\ \\text{mm}$$\nThe problem requires the final result in micrometers ($\\mu\\text{m}$). We use the standard conversion factor $1\\ \\text{mm} = 1000\\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\n$$l_{SMD} = 0.01\\ \\text{mm} \\times \\frac{1000\\ \\mu\\text{m}}{1\\ \\text{mm}} = 10\\ \\mu\\text{m}$$\nThus, each division on the stage micrometer represents a true physical distance of $10\\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nThe core of the calibration procedure is the observation of alignment between the stage micrometer and the ocular micrometer at the given magnification of $400\\times$. The problem states that $20$ stage micrometer divisions ($20\\ \\text{SMD}$) perfectly align with $80$ ocular micrometer divisions ($80\\ \\text{OMD}$). This means the physical length covered by $20$ SMDs is identical to the physical length represented by $80$ OMDs.\n\nLet $L_{align}$ be this total aligned physical length. We can calculate $L_{align}$ using the known length of the stage micrometer divisions:\n$$L_{align} = 20\\ \\text{SMD} \\times l_{SMD} = 20 \\times 10\\ \\mu\\text{m} = 200\\ \\mu\\text{m}$$\n\nNow we have an equivalence: the length of $200\\ \\mu\\text{m}$ is represented by $80$ divisions on the ocular micrometer scale. The calibration factor $C$, in units of micrometers per ocular division, is found by dividing this total length by the corresponding number of ocular micrometer divisions:\n$$C = \\frac{L_{align}}{80\\ \\text{OMD}} = \\frac{200\\ \\mu\\text{m}}{80\\ \\text{OMD}}$$\n$$C = 2.5\\ \\frac{\\mu\\text{m}}{\\text{OMD}}$$\nThe information about the total magnification, $400\\times$, is critical because this calibration factor $C$ is valid only for this specific magnification. If the objective lens were changed, the calibration would need to be re-established. The calculation itself does not use the value $400$, as the direct comparison of the scales implicitly accounts for the magnification.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed to four significant figures. To represent the value $2.5$ with four significant figures, we write it as $2.500$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.500}$$", "id": "4801241"}, {"introduction": "Once parasites are identified, it is often clinically important to assess the intensity of the infection.

The structures are observed to be rounded, measuring approximately $15$–$25$ $\\mu\\text{m}$, with thick, refractile borders and internal inclusions. We will derive the differentiating features based on the provided principles.\n\n1.  **Iodine Staining Chemistry and Internal Inclusions:**\n    The problem specifies that iodine complexes with polysaccharides, exhibiting different colors for starch versus glycogen.\n    *   **Starch:** This is the primary storage polysaccharide in plants, found within granules called amyloplasts. Starch is a polymer of glucose, consisting of linear amylose chains and branched amylopectin. In Lugol's iodine solution, the triiodide ion ($I_3^-$) intercalates into the helical structure of amylose, forming a stable charge-transfer complex. This complex strongly absorbs light across the visible spectrum, resulting in a characteristic deep blue-black color. These stained starch granules would appear as the \"dark internal inclusions\" mentioned. This staining is stable and does not fade quickly.\n    *   **Glycogen:** This is the storage polysaccharide in animals and protozoa. It is a highly branched polymer of glucose. Due to its extensive branching, it does not form long helical structures like amylose. The interaction with iodine is less organized, resulting in a less intense, yellow-brown to reddish-brown coloration. In protozoan cysts, this glycogen is often contained within a discrete mass or vacuole. This glycogen vacuole, if present, is a metabolic store and its staining may fade over time as the glycogen is consumed or diffuses.\n\n2.  **Cellular Anatomy and Morphology:**\n    The problem provides key anatomical differences between plant cells and protozoan cysts.\n    *   **Plant Cells:**\n        *   **Wall:** They possess a cell wall made primarily of cellulose. This wall is rigid and provides structural support. During digestion, the wall may partially degrade, but it often remains as a thick, refractile border. The fibrous nature of cellulose can lead to an appearance that is not perfectly smooth, but may show subtle texture, uneven thickness, or striations.\n        *   **Internal Structure:** A key feature of a mature plant parenchyma cell is a large central vacuole that can occupy up to $90\\%$ of the cell volume. This vacuole pushes the cytoplasm, nucleus, and other organelles (like the starch-containing amyloplasts) to the periphery of the cell. Consequently, the single ($n=1$) nucleus is often flattened against the cell wall and can be very difficult to visualize, especially without specific nuclear stains or fine focusing.\n    *   **Protozoan Cysts:**\n        *   **Wall:** They have a non-cellulosic cyst wall that is a protective secretion. This wall is typically uniform in thickness and characteristically smooth and highly refractile. In bright-field microscopy, it often presents a clean, sharp \"double contour\" or \"double wall\" appearance.\n        *   **Internal Structure:** Cysts lack a large central vacuole. Their cytoplasm contains one or more nuclei, and may also contain chromatoid bodies (aggregates of ribosomes, usually in immature cysts) and a glycogen vacuole. The number and morphology of the nuclei are critical, species-specific diagnostic features. For example, a mature *Entamoeba histolytica* cyst contains up to $4$ nuclei, while a mature *Entamoeba coli* cyst contains up to $8$. Each nucleus has a distinct internal structure, including a karyosome (a mass of chromatin) and peripheral chromatin lining the nuclear membrane, which are visible with iodine staining.\n\n### Synthesis for Differentiation\n\nBased on the derivation, the trainee's confusion is understandable: both structures can be round, fall in the $15$–$25$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ range, have a refractile \"wall\", and contain internal \"bodies\" that stain with iodine. However, a rigorous examination reveals clear differentiating features. The most reliable confirmatory checks are:\n\n1.  **Nuclear Examination:** This is the most definitive check. A protozoan cyst will have a specific number of discrete, well-defined nuclei ($n \\ge 1$, often $4$ or $8$ in mature *Entamoeba* spp.), each with identifiable internal morphology (karyosome, peripheral chromatin). A plant cell will have only one nucleus ($n=1$) that is typically displaced and flattened against the cell periphery by a large, non-staining central vacuole, making it difficult to see.\n2.  **Wall Texture:** The cyst wall is characteristically smooth and uniform. The plant cell wall, being composed of cellulose and subject to digestion, often appears less uniform, with potential striations, crenations, or uneven thickness.\n3.  **Iodine Reaction of Inclusions:** The \"dark internal inclusions\" in a plant cell are starch granules staining a stable, deep blue-black. In a cyst, iodine-staining inclusions would be a yellow-brown glycogen vacuole (which is not always present) and the nuclei themselves, which stain to reveal their internal structure.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Verify $n$ (number of nuclei) and their morphology and assess the wall texture while observing iodine reaction kinetics: plant cells typically have $1$ nucleus displaced peripherally by a large vacuole, a cellulose wall with subtle striations or uneven thickness, and deep blue-black staining of starch granules that remains stable; true protozoan cysts show discrete multiple nuclei with recognizable karyosomes and species-appropriate peripheral chromatin, a smooth refractile wall often with a clean double contour, and glycogen vacuoles that stain yellow-brown and dissipate over time.**\nThis option perfectly aligns with the derivation. It correctly identifies the most reliable checks: nuclear number/morphology and wall texture. It accurately describes the key features of both plant cells (one peripheral nucleus, uneven cellulose wall, blue-black starch) and protozoan cysts (multiple nuclei with specific morphology, smooth wall, yellow-brown glycogen). The mention of iodine reaction kinetics (dissipation) is also a valid, albeit secondary, point.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Rely primarily on size and roundness thresholds: objects larger than $25$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ are plant cells, whereas those smaller than $15$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ are cysts, making nuclear and wall assessments unnecessary.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. The size range of $15$–$25$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ is explicitly stated as the range of the observed objects, which is a known overlap zone for many important cysts (e.g., *Entamoeba coli*) and artifacts. Relying on arbitrary size cutoffs is a dangerous oversimplification and a common source of diagnostic error. It wrongly dismisses nuclear and wall assessments, which are the most critical differentiating features as established in our derivation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Warm the slide to $37$ $\\degree\\text{C}$ to elicit motility and confirm cysts by the persistence of blue-black iodine staining; plant cells will be non-motile and show only faint brown iodine staining.**\nThis option contains multiple scientific errors. First, cysts are a non-motile stage; warming the slide to $37^\\circ\\text{C}$ is a technique used to observe the motility of *trophozoites*, not cysts. Second, it misidentifies the staining reactions: protozoan cysts contain glycogen which stains yellow-brown, not blue-black. Blue-black staining is characteristic of starch in plant cells. The option incorrectly states plant cells would stain faint brown.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Apply a modified acid-fast stain to determine acid-fastness; plant cells are acid-fast positive while protozoan cysts are acid-fast negative, providing a clear distinction.**\nThis option misapplies a specialized stain and makes factually incorrect statements. The modified acid-fast stain is used for coccidian parasites (*Cryptosporidium*, *Cyclospora*), not for amoebic cysts like *Entamoeba*. Furthermore, plant cells are not acid-fast. *Entamoeba* cysts are also not acid-fast. Therefore, both the artifact (plant cell) and the suspected protozoan (*Entamoeba*) would be acid-fast negative, providing no distinction whatsoever. The premise that plant cells are acid-fast positive is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4801258"}]}
