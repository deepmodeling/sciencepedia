Use the following assumptions grounded in standard cell biological and kinematic principles: (i) fast axonal transport proceeds at a constant mean velocity along the microtubule track, (ii) the transit time is determined solely by the path length and mean velocity, and (iii) the mean retrograde velocity scales linearly with dynein functional capacity. You are given an anterograde transport velocity of $v_{a} = 200$ mm/day. For baseline conditions, take the mean retrograde velocity to equal the anterograde velocity, $v_{r,0} = v_{a}$.

The concept of axonal transport mediated by kinesin and dynein motors is fundamental to cell biology. The values provided for axon length ($L=1$ m for a corticospinal neuron) and transport velocity ($v_a = 200$ mm/day for fast axonal transport) are physiologically realistic.

It is a well-structured biophysics problem applying basic kinematic principles.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this problem is the kinematic relationship for motion at a constant velocity, where the transit time, $t$, is the ratio of the distance traveled, $d$, to the constant velocity, $v$. For this problem, the distance is the length of the axon, $L$.\n$$t = \\frac{L}{v}$$\nAll calculations must use consistent units. The length $L$ is given in meters (m) and the velocities are in millimeters per day (mm/day). We will convert the length to millimeters.\n$$L = 1 \\text{ m} = 1000 \\text{ mm}$$\n\nFirst, we determine the delivery time for synaptic vesicle precursors, which undergo anterograde transport from the soma to the terminal. This time, $t_a$, is calculated using the anterograde velocity, $v_a$.\n$$v_a = 200 \\text{ mm/day}$$\n$$t_a = \\frac{L}{v_a} = \\frac{1000 \\text{ mm}}{200 \\text{ mm/day}} = 5 \\text{ days}$$\nThis is the delivery time for synaptic vesicle precursors.\n\nNext, we address the retrograde signaling latency. We must calculate the baseline time, $t_{r,0}$, and the impaired time, $t_{r,1}$.\n\nThe baseline retrograde velocity, $v_{r,0}$, is given as equal to the anterograde velocity.\n$$v_{r,0} = v_a = 200 \\text{ mm/day}$$\nThe baseline retrograde signaling latency, $t_{r,0}$, is therefore:\n$$t_{r,0} = \\frac{L}{v_{r,0}} = \\frac{1000 \\text{ mm}}{200 \\text{ mm/day}} = 5 \\text{ days}$$\n\nUnder the condition of dynein impairment, the retrograde velocity is reduced. The new velocity, $v_{r,1}$, is described by a linear scaling with the reduced functional capacity. The capacity is reduced by $0.25$, meaning it is now $1 - 0.25 = 0.75$ of its baseline value.\n$$v_{r,1} = (1 - 0.25) v_{r,0} = 0.75 \\times v_{r,0}$$\nSubstituting the value for $v_{r,0}$:\n$$v_{r,1} = 0.75 \\times (200 \\text{ mm/day}) = 150 \\text{ mm/day}$$\nThe impaired retrograde signaling latency, $t_{r,1}$, is calculated using this new velocity:\n$$t_{r,1} = \\frac{L}{v_{r,1}} = \\frac{1000 \\text{ mm}}{150 \\text{ mm/day}} = \\frac{100}{15} \\text{ days} = \\frac{20}{3} \\text{ days}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the increase in retrograde signaling latency, which is the difference between the impaired latency and the baseline latency. Let this increase be $\\Delta t_r$.\n$$\\Delta t_r = t_{r,1} - t_{r,0}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\\Delta t_r = \\frac{20}{3} \\text{ days} - 5 \\text{ days}$$\nTo subtract, we use a common denominator:\n$$\\Delta t_r = \\frac{20}{3} - \\frac{15}{3} = \\frac{5}{3} \\text{ days}$$\nThe problem requires this answer as a single number in days, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\Delta t_r = \\frac{5}{3} \\approx 1.6666... \\text{ days}$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$\\Delta t_r = 1.667 \\text{ days}$$\nThis is the increase in retrograde signaling latency due to the specified dynein impairment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.667}$$", "id": "4997795"}, {"introduction": "The progressive loss of motor neurons in ALS can be monitored clinically.

This potential results from the synchronous activation of all $N$ motor units.\nLet $A_{SMUP, i}$ be the amplitude of the potential generated by the $i$-th single motor unit, where the index $i$ ranges from $1$ to $N$.\n\nThe problem states that extracellular potentials sum approximately linearly. Therefore, the supramaximal CMAP amplitude is the sum of the amplitudes of all individual single motor unit potentials:\n$$A_{CMAP, max} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} A_{SMUP, i}$$\n\nThe mean single motor unit potential amplitude, denoted as $\\bar{A}_{SMUP}$, is defined as the total potential from all units divided by the number of units:\n$$\\bar{A}_{SMUP} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} A_{SMUP, i}$$\n\nBy rearranging the definition of the mean, the sum of the individual SMUP amplitudes can be expressed as:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} A_{SMUP, i} = N \\cdot \\bar{A}_{SMUP}$$\n\nSubstituting this expression back into the equation for the supramaximal CMAP amplitude, we obtain the relationship:\n$$A_{CMAP, max} = N \\cdot \\bar{A}_{SMUP}$$\n\nSolving for $N$, the motor unit number estimation, yields the desired expression:\n$$N = \\frac{A_{CMAP, max}}{\\bar{A}_{SMUP}}$$\nThis equation demonstrates that the MUNE is the ratio of the maximal CMAP amplitude to the mean SMUP amplitude.\n\nNext, we compute the MUNE using the provided experimental data.
