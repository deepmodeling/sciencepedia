This practice explores the leading theory that phasic dopamine bursts encode a reward prediction error (RPE), a 'teaching signal' that drives learning. By calculating the RPE, you will see how drugs can artificially generate a powerful learning signal, tricking the brain into overvaluing drug-related experiences. [@problem_id:5040825]", "problem": "In the mesolimbic pathway, phasic activity of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is commonly interpreted as encoding a reward prediction error (RPE) that updates value estimates in downstream targets such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Consider a simple one-step temporal-difference learning scenario in which an agent transitions from state $s_t$ to state $s_{t+1}$ at time $t$, receives an immediate primary reward $r_t$, and maintains a scalar state-value function $V(s)$ that is interpreted biologically as the current prediction of discounted future reward. Use the following foundational bases: the discounted return is defined as $G_t = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^{k} r_{t+k}$ with discount factor $\\gamma \\in (0,1)$, and the state value is $V(s) = \\mathbb{E}[G_t \\mid s_t = s]$. From these definitions and the consistency of $V(s)$ with the discounted return, derive the canonical one-step temporal-difference RPE appropriate for mapping to phasic dopamine dynamics, and then compute its value for a single trial with $r_t = 1$, $\\gamma = 0.95$, $V(s_{t+1}) = 0.8$, and $V(s_t) = 0.5$. Round your numerical result to four significant figures and report it as a pure number with no units. Additionally, indicate qualitatively (in words) whether the sign and approximate magnitude of the computed RPE would predict a transient increase or decrease in VTA dopamine neuron firing, but do not include this qualitative mapping in your final numeric answer.", "solution": "The task is to first derive the expression for the one-step temporal-difference (TD) reward prediction error (RPE) and then compute its value for a specific trial. The RPE, denoted as $\\delta_t$, is hypothesized to be encoded by the phasic activity of dopamine neurons.\n\nThe derivation begins with the foundational definitions provided. The discounted return at time $t$ is given by:\n$$G_t = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^{k} r_{t+k}$$\nwhere $r_{t+k}$ is the reward received at time $t+k$ and $\\gamma \\in (0,1)$ is the discount factor.\n\nThe state-value function, $V(s)$, is the expectation of this discounted return, given the current state $s_t=s$:\n$$V(s) = \\mathbb{E}[G_t \\mid s_t = s]$$\n\nTo derive the one-step RPE, we first establish a recursive relationship for the discounted return, $G_t$. We can expand the sum for $G_t$ as:\n$$G_t = r_t + \\gamma r_{t+1} + \\gamma^2 r_{t+2} + \\dots$$\nFactoring out a $\\gamma$ from all terms except the first gives:\n$$G_t = r_t + \\gamma (r_{t+1} + \\gamma r_{t+2} + \\dots)$$\nThe term in the parenthesis is, by definition, the discounted return starting from time $t+1$, which is $G_{t+1}$. This yields the fundamental recursive relationship:\n$$G_t = r_t + \\gamma G_{t+1}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute this recursive form of $G_t$ into the definition of the state-value function $V(s_t)$:\n$$V(s_t) = \\mathbb{E}[r_t + \\gamma G_{t+1} \\mid s_t]$$\nUsing the linearity of the expectation operator, we can separate the terms:\n$$V(s_t) = \\mathbb{E}[r_t \\mid s_t] + \\mathbb{E}[\\gamma G_{t+1} \\mid s_t]$$\n$$V(s_t) = \\mathbb{E}[r_t \\mid s_t] + \\gamma \\mathbb{E}[G_{t+1} \\mid s_t]$$\nThe term $\\mathbb{E}[G_{t+1} \\mid s_t]$ represents the expected return from the next time step, given the current state $s_t$. By the law of total expectation, this can be written as the expectation over all possible next states $s_{t+1}$ of the value of those states: $\\mathbb{E}_{s_{t+1}}[\\mathbb{E}[G_{t+1} \\mid s_{t+1}]] = \\mathbb{E}[V(s_{t+1}) \\mid s_t]$. This leads to the Bellman equation for the value function:\n$$V(s_t) = \\mathbb{E}[r_t + \\gamma V(s_{t+1}) \\mid s_t]$$\n\nThe temporal-difference RPE, $\\delta_t$, is the difference between an updated estimate of the value of state $s_t$ and the current estimate, $V(s_t)$. The updated estimate, known as the TD target, is formed using the actual reward $r_t$ received at time $t$ and the current estimate of the value of the successor state, $V(s_{t+1})$. For a single, observed transition, the TD target is $r_t + \\gamma V(s_{t+1})$.\n\nThe RPE is therefore the difference between this target and the agent's prior prediction, $V(s_t)$:\n$$\\delta_t = \\left( r_t + \\gamma V(s_{t+1}) \\right) - V(s_t)$$\nThis is the canonical expression for the one-step temporal-difference reward prediction error.\n\nThe problem then requires the computation of $\\delta_t$ for a single trial with the following given values:\n- Immediate reward: $r_t = 1$\n- Discount factor: $\\gamma = 0.95$\n- Value of the next state: $V(s_{t+1}) = 0.8$\n- Value of the current state: $V(s_t) = 0.5$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula for $\\delta_t$:\n$$\\delta_t = 1 + (0.95 \\times 0.8) - 0.5$$\nFirst, we compute the product:\n$$0.95 \\times 0.8 = 0.76$$\nNow, we substitute this back into the equation for $\\delta_t$:\n$$\\delta_t = 1 + 0.76 - 0.5$$\n$$\\delta_t = 1.76 - 0.5$$\n$$\\delta_t = 1.26$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, the value is $1.260$.\n\nQualitatively, the computed RPE is $\\delta_t = 1.260$. Since this value is positive, it signifies a \"positive prediction error,\" meaning the actual experienced outcome (immediate reward plus the discounted value of the future) was better than predicted. According to the dopamine RPE hypothesis, a positive $\\delta_t$ would be encoded by a transient, phasic increase in the firing rate of VTA dopamine neurons above their tonic baseline.
