Their energetic demand arises from action potential conduction along axon length, synaptic vesicle cycling at release sites, and basal maintenance of ionic gradients and axonal transport. Mitochondria supply adenosine triphosphate (ATP), with a production rate per mitochondrion and a linear density along the axon. Assume the following widely accepted bases:\n- An action potential causes sodium influx that must be extruded by the sodium-potassium ATPase, which hydrolyzes one ATP per three sodium ions; empirical measurements can be summarized as an effective ATP cost per meter of axon per spike. Denote this cost by $k_{c}$ (ATP molecules per meter per spike).\n- Each synaptic vesicle cycle (fusion, retrieval, and refilling) has an effective ATP cost $C_{v}$ (ATP molecules per vesicle).\n- The basal maintenance cost along axon independent of spiking is proportional to axonal length with coefficient $k_{b}$ (ATP molecules per meter per second).\n- The average number of vesicles released per second is the product of firing rate $f$ (spikes per second), the number of release sites $N$, and the release probability per site per spike $p$.\n- Mitochondrial ATP supply equals the total number of mitochondria times the per-mitochondrion production rate $r_{m}$ (ATP molecules per second); the axonal mitochondrial count is the product of axonal length in micrometers and the linear density $\\rho_{m}$ (mitochondria per micrometer), and an additional $M_{\\text{soma}}$ mitochondria contribute from the soma.\n- Avogadro’s number is $N_{A}$, so that $1$ picomole (pmol) equals $N_{A} \\times 10^{-12}$ molecules.\n\nStarting from these bases, derive symbolic expressions for the total ATP demand rate per neuron, $D$ (in molecules per second), as the sum of conduction, vesicle cycling, and basal maintenance terms, and for the total mitochondrial ATP supply rate, $S$ (in molecules per second). Then convert both rates to picomoles per second using $N_{A}$ and finally compute the dimensionless ratio $R = D/S$.\n\nUse the parameter values:\n- Axonal length $L = 0.45$ m.\n- Number of release sites $N = 2.0 \\times 10^{5}$.\n- Firing rate $f = 4.0$ s$^{-1}$.\n- Release probability $p = 5 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n- ATP cost per vesicle $C_{v} = 1.5 \\times 10^{5}$ molecules.\n- Conduction cost per spike per meter $k_{c} = 2.0 \\times 10^{10}$ molecules m$^{-1}$ spike$^{-1}$.\n- Basal maintenance cost per meter $k_{b} = 5.35 \\times 10^{10}$ molecules m$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$.\n- Axonal mitochondrial density $\\rho_{m} = 0.03$ $\\mu$m$^{-1}$.\n- Mitochondrial ATP production rate $r_{m} = 5.0 \\times 10^{6}$ molecules s$^{-1}$.\n- Soma mitochondrial count $M_{\\text{soma}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{3}$.\n- Avogadro’s number $N_{A} = 6.022 \\times 10^{23}$ mol$^{-1}$.\n\nInstructions:\n1.

The available transporter density, $B_{\\text{avail}}$, is the direct measure of the DAT population. Therefore, we seek to calculate the fractional reduction in $B_{\\text{avail}}$.\n\nLet $B_{\\text{avail}, H}$ represent the available transporter density in healthy individuals and $B_{\\text{avail}, PD}$ represent the density in patients with early PD. The fractional reduction, denoted by $R$, is defined as the change in the quantity relative to its initial (or reference) value. Here, the healthy state is the reference.\n$$\nR = \\frac{B_{\\text{avail}, H} - B_{\\text{avail}, PD}}{B_{\\text{avail}, H}}\n$$\nThis expression can be rewritten as:\n$$\nR = 1 - \\frac{B_{\\text{avail}, PD}}{B_{\\text{avail}, H}}\n$$\nThe problem states the definition of the specific binding potential, $BP_{ND}$:\n$$\nBP_{ND} = f_{ND} \\cdot \\frac{B_{\\text{avail}}}{K_{D}}\n$$\nWe are given that for the specific radiotracer and imaging conditions used, the free fraction $f_{ND}$ and the dissociation constant $K_{D}$ do not change between the healthy and PD groups. We can therefore define a constant of proportionality, $k$, as:\n$$\nk = \\frac{f_{ND}}{K_{D}}\n$$\nSince $k$ is constant across groups, the relationship between $BP_{ND}$ and $B_{\\text{avail}}$ is:\n$$\nBP_{ND} = k \\cdot B_{\\text{avail}}\n$$\nThis confirms the stated proportionality. We can write this relationship for both the healthy and PD groups:\nFor the healthy group:\n$$\nBP_{ND, H} = k \\cdot B_{\\text{avail}, H} \\implies B_{\\text{avail}, H} = \\frac{BP_{ND, H}}{k}\n$$\nFor the PD group:\n$$\nBP_{ND, PD} = k \\cdot B_{\\text{avail}, PD} \\implies B_{\\text{avail}, PD} = \\frac{BP_{ND, PD}}{k}\n$$\nNow, we substitute these expressions for $B_{\\text{avail}, H}$ and $B_{\\text{avail}, PD}$ into the formula for the fractional reduction $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\frac{BP_{ND, H}}{k} - \\frac{BP_{ND, PD}}{k}}{\\frac{BP_{ND, H}}{k}}\n$$\nThe constant of proportionality $k$ is present in all terms and can be cancelled out:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\frac{1}{k} (BP_{ND, H} - BP_{ND, PD})}{\\frac{1}{k} (BP_{ND, H})} = \\frac{BP_{ND, H} - BP_{ND, PD}}{BP_{ND, H}}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the fractional reduction in DAT binding, expressed in terms of the measurable imaging outcome, $BP_{ND}$.
