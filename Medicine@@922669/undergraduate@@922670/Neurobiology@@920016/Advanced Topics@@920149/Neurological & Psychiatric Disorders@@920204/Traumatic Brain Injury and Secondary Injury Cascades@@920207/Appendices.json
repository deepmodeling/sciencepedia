It presents a realistic scenario from neurobiology and asks for a standard calculation based on fundamental principles of chemical kinetics. All necessary data are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the initial rate of hydroxyl radical ($\\mathrm{OH}\\cdot$) production from the Fenton reaction under conditions relevant to traumatic brain injury.

For an elementary reaction, the rate law is determined directly by the reaction's stoichiometry. The rate of reaction, denoted by $v$, is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants, with each concentration raised to the power of its stoichiometric coefficient. For the Fenton reaction, the reactants are $\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ and $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}_2$, and their stoichiometric coefficients are both $1$.\n\nThe rate law is therefore expressed as:\n$$\nv = k_{\\mathrm{F}} [\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}]^{1} [\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}_2]^{1} = k_{\\mathrm{F}} [\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}] [\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}_2]\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{F}}$ is the second-order rate constant.\n\nThe rate of formation of a product is related to the overall reaction rate $v$ by the product's stoichiometric coefficient.
