The pathologist notes a significant infiltration of immune cells.

These amoeboid microglia are seen to be actively performing phagocytosis.\n\nGiven the characteristic pathophysiology of Multiple Sclerosis, what is the primary cellular structure or substance that these activated microglia are phagocytosing within the acute lesion?\n\nA.

To solve this, we must understand the fundamental pathology of MS and the role of microglia in this context.\n\n1.  **Pathophysiology of Multiple Sclerosis (MS):** MS is an autoimmune disease of the Central Nervous System (CNS). The core pathological feature of MS is an inflammatory attack by the body's own immune system directed against the myelin sheath. The myelin sheath is a fatty, insulating layer that surrounds nerve axons, crucial for the rapid and efficient conduction of electrical signals. The destruction of this sheath is known as demyelination. This process leads to the formation of lesions, or plaques, in the brain and spinal cord, disrupting nerve communication and causing the neurological symptoms of the disease.\n\n2.  **Role of Microglia:** Microglia are the resident immune cells of the CNS. In a healthy state, they exist in a \"ramified\" or branched state, constantly surveying their microenvironment. When they detect signs of injury, infection, or inflammation—such as the autoimmune attack in an MS lesion—they become \"activated.\"\n\n3.  **Microglial Activation and Phagocytosis:** Activation involves a dramatic change in their morphology to an \"amoeboid\" (blob-like) shape, which facilitates migration to the site of injury and enhances their phagocytic capabilities. Phagocytosis is the process by which a cell engulfs and digests solid particles, such as cellular debris, dead cells, or pathogens.\n\n4.  **Connecting the Concepts:** In an active MS lesion, the autoimmune attack is actively destroying myelin sheaths. This creates a large amount of lipid and protein-rich myelin debris. The activated, amoeboid microglia migrate to these areas and act as \"clean-up crews,\" phagocytosing this debris. While this is a cleanup response, the pro-inflammatory state of the microglia can also contribute to further tissue damage. Therefore, the primary and most characteristic target of microglial phagocytosis in an acute MS lesion is the debris from the damaged myelin sheaths.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A. Apoptotic neurons:** While some neuronal death can occur as a secondary consequence of demyelination and inflammation, it is not the primary pathological event or the main target of phagocytosis in an early, active lesion. The attack is primarily on myelin.\n    *   **B. Debris from damaged myelin sheaths:** This aligns perfectly with the known pathophysiology of MS, where demyelination is the central event. Clearing this debris is a hallmark function of activated microglia in MS plaques.\n    *   **C. Extracellular amyloid-beta plaques:** These are the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, not Multiple Sclerosis. This option tests for the ability to differentiate the pathology of distinct neurodegenerative disorders.\n    *   **D. Hypertrophic astrocytes:** Astrocytes, another type of glial cell, react to CNS injury by becoming hypertrophic (enlarging) and forming a glial scar (astrogliosis). This is a response to the damage, not the initial material being phagocytosed by microglia in the acute inflammatory phase. Microglia do not primarily phagocytose living astrocytes.\n    *   **E. Invasive T-lymphocytes:** T-lymphocytes are key drivers of the autoimmune attack in MS, but they are not the primary target of microglial phagocytosis. Microglia interact with T-cells, but their main phagocytic role is clearing the debris *caused* by the attack.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is that the microglia are phagocytosing the debris from damaged myelin sheaths.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2337229"}, {"introduction": "The loss of myelin has a direct and measurable impact on the function of a neuron. This exercise moves from the qualitative to the quantitative, asking you to calculate how changes in myelin thickness affect nerve conduction velocity using the biophysical concept of the $g$-ratio.

The thickness change is reflected in the $g$-ratio, defined as $g = \\frac{d}{D_{\\text{fiber}}}$, where $d$ is the axon diameter and $D_{\\text{fiber}}$ is the total fiber diameter (axon plus myelin). For myelinated axons, conduction velocity $v$ scales linearly with total fiber diameter due to the combined effects of reduced membrane capacitance and increased membrane resistance in the internode; that is, $v$ is proportional to $D_{\\text{fiber}}$. Assume that the internode length, nodal properties, and axonal diameter $d$ remain unchanged across the two states.\n\nIf the $g$-ratio changes from $0.6$ (before remyelination) to $0.8$ (after remyelination), compute the ratio of the conduction velocity after remyelination to that before remyelination, $\\frac{v_{\\text{after}}}{v_{\\text{before}}}$.
