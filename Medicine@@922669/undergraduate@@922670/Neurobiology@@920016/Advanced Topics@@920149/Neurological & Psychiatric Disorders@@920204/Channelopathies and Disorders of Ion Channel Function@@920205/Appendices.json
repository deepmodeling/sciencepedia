A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe resting membrane potential, $V_{\\text{rest}}$, is defined as the steady-state membrane potential, $V_m$, at which the total transmembrane current, $I_{\\text{total}}$, is zero.

At steady state, this sum must be zero:\n$$J_{\\text{total}} = J_K + J_L = 0$$\nThe problem states that the currents are linear, which corresponds to an Ohmic relationship. The current density for a given ionic species `$i$` is defined as:\n$$J_i = g_i (V_m - E_i)$$\nwhere $g_i$ is the conductance density, $V_m$ is the membrane potential, and $E_i$ is the reversal potential for that ion.\n\nApplying this definition to the potassium and leak currents yields:\n$$J_K = g_K (V_m - E_K)$$\n$$J_L = g_L (V_m - E_L)$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the current balance equation at rest (where $V_m = V_{\\text{rest}}$) gives:\n$$g_K (V_{\\text{rest}} - E_K) + g_L (V_{\\text{rest}} - E_L) = 0$$\nThis equation is the formal representation of the problem's steady-state condition.

The equilibrium ratio of probabilities is given by:\n$$ \\frac{P_O}{P_C} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nwhere $\\Delta G = G_O - G_C$ is the difference in Gibbs free energy between the two states, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

Depolarization (increasing $V$) promotes activation, meaning $m_{\\infty}(V)$ increases with $V$. This requires a positive gating charge, $z_m > 0$. Thus, $|z_m| = z_m$, and the slope factor is $k_m = \\frac{k_B T}{z_m e}$.
