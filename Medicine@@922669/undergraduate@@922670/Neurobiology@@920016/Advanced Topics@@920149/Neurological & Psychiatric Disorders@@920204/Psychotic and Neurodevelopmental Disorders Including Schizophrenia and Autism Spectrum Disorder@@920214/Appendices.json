The total fractional occupancy, $\\theta_{total}$, is the fraction of the total receptor population $[R_T]$ that is bound by either ligand.\n\n$$\n\\theta_{total} = \\frac{[RL_1] + [RL_2]}{[R_T]}\n$$\n\nAccording to the principle of receptor conservation, the total concentration of receptors $[R_T]$ is the sum of free receptors $[R]$ and all bound receptor species.\n$$\n[R_T] = [R] + [RL_1] + [RL_2]\n$$\n\nFrom the definition of the dissociation constant, $K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$, we can express the concentration of each receptor-ligand complex in terms of the free receptor concentration $[R]$, the free ligand concentration $[L]$, and the respective dissociation constant $K_d$.\n$$\n[RL_1] = \\frac{[R][L_1]}{K_{d1}}\n$$\n$$\n[RL_2] = \\frac{[R][L_2]}{K_{d2}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the receptor conservation equation:\n$$\n[R_T] = [R] + \\frac{[R][L_1]}{K_{d1}} + \\frac{[R][L_2]}{K_{d2}} = [R] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[L_1]}{K_{d1}} + \\frac{[L_2]}{K_{d2}} \\right)\n$$\n\nThe numerator of the fractional occupancy equation is $[RL_1] + [RL_2]$. We can also express this in terms of $[R]$:\n$$\n[RL_1] + [RL_2] = \\frac{[R][L_1]}{K_{d1}} + \\frac{[R][L_2]}{K_{d2}} = [R] \\left( \\frac{[L_1]}{K_{d1}} + \\frac{[L_2]}{K_{d2}} \\right)\n$$\n\nNow, we can write the expression for $\\theta_{total}$ by substituting the expressions for the numerator and denominator:\n$$\n\\theta_{total} = \\frac{[R] \\left( \\frac{[L_1]}{K_{d1}} + \\frac{[L_2]}{K_{d2}} \\right)}{[R] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[L_1]}{K_{d1}} + \\frac{[L_2]}{K_{d2}} \\right)}\n$$\n\nThe term for the free receptor concentration, $[R]$, cancels out, yielding the general formula for total fractional occupancy under competitive binding:\n$$\n\\theta_{total} = \\frac{\\frac{[L_1]}{K_{d1}} + \\frac{[L_2]}{K_{d2}}}{1 + \\frac{[L_1]}{K_{d1}} + \\frac{[L_2]}{K_{d2}}}\n$$\n\nThis formula will be applied to each receptor system.\n\n**1.

NMDA Receptor Glycine Site System**\nThe competing ligands are endogenous glycine (Gly) and D-cycloserine (DCS).\n- $[L_1] = [\\mathrm{Gly}] = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $K_{d1} = K_{d,\\mathrm{Gly}} = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $[L_2] = [\\mathrm{DCS}] = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $K_{d2} = K_{d,\\mathrm{DCS}} = 80\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the normalized concentration terms:\n$$\n\\frac{[\\mathrm{Gly}]}{K_{d,\\mathrm{Gly}}} = \\frac{10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = 10\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{[\\mathrm{DCS}]}{K_{d,\\mathrm{DCS}}} = \\frac{20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{80\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\n$$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the total fractional occupancy formula:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{NMDA}, total} = \\frac{10 + 0.25}{1 + 10 + 0.25} = \\frac{10.25}{11.25} = \\frac{1025}{1125}\n$$\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by common factors. Both are divisible by $25$.\n$$\n1025 = 41 \\times 25\n$$\n$$\n1125 = 45 \\times 25\n$$\nSo, the fraction simplifies to:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{NMDA}, total} = \\frac{41}{45}\n$$\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{NMDA}, total} \\approx 0.9111111... \\approx 0.9111\n$$\n\nThe final answer requires the two occupancies, for the D2 receptor and the NMDA receptor glycine site respectively, presented in a two-entry row matrix.\n- D2 receptor total fractional occupancy: $0.9189$\n- NMDA receptor glycine site total fractional occupancy: $0.9111$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.9189 & 0.9111\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5054336"}, {"introduction": "The concept of excitation-inhibition (E-I) balance is central to many theories of brain function and dysfunction, particularly in schizophrenia and ASD.

This gives:\n$$\n\\text{Re}(g\\lambda_W - 1) = 0 \\implies g \\text{Re}(\\lambda_W) - 1 = 0 \\implies g = \\frac{1}{\\text{Re}(\\lambda_W)}\n$$\nSince $g$ must be positive, this transition is only possible if there exists an eigenvalue of $W$ with a positive real part. The first instability as $g$ is increased from $0$ will be triggered by the eigenvalue of $W$ with the largest real part. Let this be $\\max_{\\lambda_W} \\text{Re}(\\lambda_W)$.

Assume independent Gaussian observation noise for accuracy and reaction time and use the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) $AIC = 2 k + n \\, \\ln(\\text{RSS}/n)$, where $k$ is the number of free parameters and $n$ is the number of observed quantities per case, to compare models. Decide in favor of the model with the smaller $AIC$, using the tie-breaking rule that $\\mathcal{M}_v$ is preferred if $AIC_{\\mathcal{M}_v} \\le AIC_{\\mathcal{M}_a}$.\n\nUse the following test suite. In all cases, the control baseline parameters are $v_{\\text{control}} = 1.0$ (evidence per second), $a_{\\text{control}} = 0.5$ (evidence), $t_{0,\\text{control}} = 0.27$ (seconds), and $s = 1.0$ (evidence per square root second). Patient observations are provided as accuracy (a decimal fraction between $0$ and $1$) and mean reaction time in seconds:\n\n- Case $1$ (happy path, drift reduction explanation expected): observed patient accuracy $= 0.668$, observed patient mean reaction time $= 0.510$ seconds.\n- Case $2$ (happy path, boundary alteration explanation expected): observed patient accuracy $= 0.802$, observed patient mean reaction time $= 0.693$ seconds.\n- Case $3$ (edge case, near-zero drift): observed patient accuracy $= 0.512$, observed patient mean reaction time $= 0.520$ seconds.\n- Case $4$ (speed-accuracy trade-off via lower boundary): observed patient accuracy $= 0.646$, observed patient mean reaction time $= 0.357$ seconds.\n\nAll times must be handled in seconds, and accuracies must be treated as decimal fractions. Angles are not involved in this problem.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the model selection decisions for the four cases as a comma-separated list of integers enclosed in square brackets. Use the mapping $0 \\rightarrow$ drift reduction preferred (Model $\\mathcal{M}_v$), $1 \\rightarrow$ boundary alteration preferred (Model $\\mathcal{M}_a$). For example, an output could look like $[0,1,0,1]$.\n\nThe required final output format is exactly one line with the list of integers in square brackets. No other text should be printed.", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the well-established Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) of cognitive science, is mathematically well-posed, and uses standard statistical methods for parameter estimation and model comparison. All constants, variables, and conditions are clearly defined.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two main parts: first, the derivation of the necessary theoretical expressions for accuracy and mean reaction time from the DDM definition; second, the algorithmic implementation of the model fitting and comparison procedure.\n\n**1. Theoretical Derivations**\n\nThe Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) describes the evolution of a decision variable $X_t$ over time $t$. The dynamics are governed by the stochastic differential equation:\n$$dX_t = v \\, dt + s \\, dW_t$$\nwhere $v$ is the drift rate, $s$ is the standard deviation of the noise (diffusion coefficient), and $dW_t$ is a standard Wiener process. The process starts at $X_0 = z_0$, and in this problem, we assume a non-biased start, so $z_0=0$. A decision is made when $X_t$ reaches one of two absorbing boundaries, placed symmetrically at $+a$ (for a \"correct\" decision) and $-a$ (for an \"incorrect\" decision). We assume $v > 0$ corresponds to evidence accumulation towards the correct boundary $+a$.\n\n**1.1. Accuracy (Probability of Correct Response)**\n\nThe accuracy, $P_{acc}$, is the probability that the process $X_t$ hits the boundary $+a$ before it hits the boundary $-a$. This is a classic first-passage probability problem for a Wiener process with drift. For a process starting at $X_0 = z_0$ with absorbing boundaries at $b_1$ and $b_2$, the probability of hitting $b_1$ first is given by the general formula:\n$$ P(\\text{hit } b_1) = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2vz_0}{s^2}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2vb_2}{s^2}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2vb_1}{s^2}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2vb_2}{s^2}\\right)} $$\nIn our specific case, the starting point is $z_0=0$, the \"correct\" boundary is $b_1 = +a$, and the \"incorrect\" boundary is $b_2 = -a$. Substituting these values into the general formula:\n$$ P_{acc} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2v(0)}{s^2}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2v(-a)}{s^2}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2v(a)}{s^2}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2v(-a)}{s^2}\\right)} $$\n$$ P_{acc} = \\frac{\\exp(0) - \\exp\\left(\\frac{2va}{s^2}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2va}{s^2}\\right) - \\exp\\left(\\frac{2va}{s^2}\\right)} = \\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{2va}{s^2}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2va}{s^2}\\right) - \\exp\\left(\\frac{2va}{s^2}\\right)} $$\nTo simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{va}{s^2}\\right)$:\n$$ P_{acc} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{va}{s^2}\\right) \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{2va}{s^2}\\right)\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{va}{s^2}\\right) \\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2va}{s^2}\\right) - \\exp\\left(\\frac{va}{s^2}\\right)\\right)} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{va}{s^2}\\right) - \\exp\\left(\\frac{va}{s^2}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{3va}{s^2}\\right) - \\exp\\left(\\frac{va}{s^2}\\right)} $$\nThis does not seem to simplify well. A more direct simplification is to factor out $-\\exp\\left(\\frac{2va}{s^2}\\right)$ from the numerator and denominator:\n$$ P_{acc} = \\frac{-\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{2va}{s^2}\\right) - 1\\right)}{-\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{2va}{s^2}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2va}{s^2}\\right)\\right)} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\frac{2va}{s^2}\\right) - 1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{2va}{s^2}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2va}{s^2}\\right)} $$\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2va}{s^2}\\right)$:\n$$ P_{acc} = \\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2va}{s^2}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4va}{s^2}\\right)} = \\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2va}{s^2}\\right)}{\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2va}{s^2}\\right)\\right)\\left(1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2va}{s^2}\\right)\\right)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2va}{s^2}\\right)} $$\nThis is the standard logistic function form for accuracy in the DDM. If $v=0$, $P_{acc} = 1/(1+1) = 1/2$, which is the correct chance-level performance.\n\n**1.2. Mean Reaction Time**\n\nThe observed reaction time ($RT$) is the sum of the decision time ($DT$) and a non-decision time ($t_0$), $RT = DT + t_0$. The mean decision time, $DT$, is the expected first-passage time to either boundary. The expected time $E(x)$ to reach a boundary from a starting point $x \\in (-a, a)$ satisfies the second-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}s^2 \\frac{d^2E}{dx^2} + v \\frac{dE}{dx} + 1 = 0 $$\nwith the boundary conditions $E(a)=0$ and $E(-a)=0$. The solution to this ODE at the starting point $x=0$ gives the mean decision time:\n$$ DT = E(0) = \\frac{a}{v} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{va}{s^2}\\right) $$\nA special case occurs when the drift rate $v$ is zero. The expression becomes indeterminate ($0/0$). We must take the limit as $v \\to 0$. Using the Taylor series expansion for $\\tanh(x) \\approx x$ for small $x$:\n$$ \\lim_{v\\to 0} DT = \\lim_{v\\to 0} \\left[ \\frac{a}{v} \\left(\\frac{va}{s^2}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{a^2}{s^2} $$\nThis is the well-known result for the mean first-passage time of a standard Wiener process (no drift) from the origin to boundaries at $\\pm a$.\n\nThe final expression for the mean reaction time is:\n$$ RT(v, a, s, t_0) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{a}{v} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{va}{s^2}\\right) + t_0 & \\text{if } v \\neq 0 \\\\ \\frac{a^2}{s^2} + t_0 & \\text{if } v = 0 \\end{cases} $$\n\n**2. Model Fitting and Comparison**\n\nWe are given two models to explain the difference between control and patient data:\n- **Model $\\mathcal{M}_v$**: A change in drift rate, $v_{\\text{patient}} = r_v \\, v_{\\text{control}}$, with a single free parameter $r_v$. Other parameters ($a$, $t_0$) remain fixed.\n- **Model $\\mathcal{M}_a$**: A change in boundary separation, $a_{\\text{patient}} = r_a \\, a_{\\text{control}}$, with a single free parameter $r_a$. Other parameters ($v$, $t_0$) remain fixed.\n\nFor each model, the parameter ($r_v$ or $r_a$) is estimated by minimizing the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS), also known as the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE), between the model's predictions and the observed data:\n$$ RSS = (P_{acc, pred} - P_{acc, obs})^2 + (RT_{pred} - RT_{obs})^2 $$\nThis is a one-dimensional optimization problem that can be solved numerically.\n\nThe two models are compared using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC):\n$$ AIC = 2k + n \\ln\\left(\\frac{RSS}{n}\\right) $$\nIn our case, the number of free parameters is $k=1$ for both models. The number of observed quantities being fit is $n=2$ (one accuracy value and one reaction time value). The formula becomes:\n$$ AIC = 2(1) + 2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{RSS}{2}\\right) = 2 + 2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{RSS}{2}\\right) $$\nThe model with the lower AIC value is preferred. The tie-breaking rule specifies that if $AIC_{\\mathcal{M}_v} \\le AIC_{\\mathcal{M}_a}$, Model $\\mathcal{M}_v$ is chosen. The implementation will determine the best-fitting parameter for each model, calculate the corresponding minimum RSS, compute the AIC values, and apply the decision rule for each test case.", "answer": "[0,1,0,1]", "id": "5054340"}]}
