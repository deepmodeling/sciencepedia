The process will be executed in three main steps: first, determining the Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) components ($A$, $B$, and $C$ scores); second, calculating the argument of the logistic function ($z$); and third, computing the final probability ($p$).\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\n**1.1. Extract Givens:**\n- **Neurofibrillary Tangle (NFT) staging ($B$ score):**\n  - Threshold for involvement: average NFT count per HPF $\\ge t^{\\star} = 5$.\n  - $B1$: Braak stages $\\mathrm{I}$–$\\mathrm{II}$, involvement limited to entorhinal/transentorhinal cortex.\n  - $B2$: Braak stages $\\mathrm{III}$–$\\mathrm{IV}$, limbic structures (hippocampus and/or amygdala) involved, but fewer than two neocortical association areas involved.\n  - $B3$: Braak stages $\\mathrm{V}$–$\\mathrm{VI}$, at least two neocortical association areas involved.\n- **Amyloid-beta Plaque staging ($A$ score):**\n  - Deposits counted: neuritic plaques.\n  - Threshold for involvement: average neuritic plaque count per HPF $\\ge 1$.\n  - Thal phases: Phase $1$ (neocortex), Phase $2$ (hippocampus), Phase $3$ (striatum), Phase $4$ (brainstem), Phase $5$ (cerebellum). The highest phase reached is determined.\n  - NIA–AA $A$ score mapping: $A1$ for Thal phases $\\{1,2\\}$, $A2$ for Thal phases $\\{3,4\\}$, $A3$ for Thal phase $\\{5\\}$.\n- **Neuritic Plaque Density score ($C$ score):**\n  - Basis: maximum neocortical neuritic plaque count per HPF.\n  - $C0$: count $<1$.\n  - $C1$: count $\\in [1,5]$.\n  - $C2$: count $\\in [6,15]$.\n  - $C3$: count $>15$.\n- **Case Data (average counts per HPF):**\n  - NFTs: entorhinal cortex $= 18$, hippocampus $\\mathrm{CA1} = 14$, amygdala $= 9$, temporal neocortex $= 11$, frontal neocortex $= 7$, parietal neocortex $= 5$, occipital neocortex $= 3$.\n  - Neuritic Plaques: temporal neocortex $= 12$, frontal neocortex $= 6$, parietal neocortex $= 8$, occipital neocortex $= 4$, hippocampus $\\mathrm{CA1} = 7$, striatum $= 2$, midbrain $= 0$, cerebellar cortex $= 0$.\n- **Logistic Model:**\n  - Probability: $p = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-z)}$.\n  - Linear component: $z = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{A}\\,A_{\\text{code}} + \\beta_{B}\\,B_{\\text{code}} + \\beta_{C}\\,C_{\\text{code}}$.\n  - Coded values: $A_{\\text{code}} \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ for $A1, A2, A3$; $B_{\\text{code}} \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ for $B1, B2, B3$; $C_{\\text{code}} \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$ for $C0, C1, C2, C3$.\n  - Coefficients: $\\beta_{0} = -2.0$, $\\beta_{A} = 0.8$, $\\beta_{B} = 1.1$, $\\beta_{C} = 0.9$.\n- **Final requirement:** Round $p$ to four significant figures.\n\n**1.2. Validate Using Extracted Givens:**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem uses established (though simplified for this context) neuropathological frameworks (Braak, Thal, CERAD, NIA-AA) which are standard in the field of Alzheimer's disease research. The logistic regression model is a standard statistical tool for estimating probabilities based on such scores. The problem is firmly rooted in neurobiology and biostatistics.\n- **Well-Posed:** All necessary data, definitions, thresholds, and model parameters are explicitly provided. The questions are specific and lead to a unique numerical answer.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative terms and established classificatory schemes. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n- **No other flaws are present:** The problem is self-contained, consistent, and scientifically feasible.\n\n**1.3. Verdict and Action:**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\n\n**2.1. Determine the Braak staging group ($B$ score)**\nThe threshold for neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) involvement in a region is an average count of at least $t^{\\star} = 5$. We evaluate each region from the case data:\n- Entorhinal cortex: $18 \\ge 5$ (Involved)\n- Hippocampus CA1: $14 \\ge 5$ (Involved)\n- Amygdala: $9 \\ge 5$ (Involved)\n- Temporal association neocortex: $11 \\ge 5$ (Involved)\n- Frontal association neocortex: $7 \\ge 5$ (Involved)\n- Parietal association neocortex: $5 \\ge 5$ (Involved)\n- Occipital primary visual cortex: $3 < 5$ (Not involved)\n\nNext, we apply the rules for the $B$ score:\n- $B1$: Involvement limited to entorhinal cortex. This is false, as other regions are involved.\n- $B2$: Limbic structures (hippocampus and/or amygdala) are involved, but fewer than two neocortical association areas are involved. Here, both hippocampus and amygdala are involved. The involved neocortical association areas are temporal, frontal, and parietal, which is a total of $3$ areas. Since $3$ is not fewer than $2$, this rule does not apply.\n- $B3$: At least two neocortical association areas are involved. As established, $3$ such areas are involved (temporal, frontal, parietal). Since $3 \\ge 2$, this condition is met.\n\nTherefore, the Braak staging group is $B3$. The corresponding code is $B_{\\text{code}} = 3$.\n\n**2.2. Determine the Thal phase group ($A$ score)**\nThe threshold for neuritic plaque (NP) involvement is an average count of at least $1$. The Thal phases are assessed sequentially:\n- Phase $1$ (Neocortex): The counts are $12$ (temporal), $6$ (frontal), $8$ (parietal), and $4$ (occipital). All are $\\ge 1$. Phase $1$ is reached.\n- Phase $2$ (Hippocampus): The count is $7$. Since $7 \\ge 1$, Phase $2$ is reached.\n- Phase $3$ (Striatum): The count is $2$. Since $2 \\ge 1$, Phase $3$ is reached.\n- Phase $4$ (Brainstem/Midbrain): The count is $0$. Since $0 < 1$, Phase $4$ is not reached.\n- Phase $5$ (Cerebellum): The count is $0$. Since $0 < 1$, Phase $5$ is not reached.\n\nThe highest Thal phase reached is Phase $3$. We now map this to the $A$ score:\n- $A1$: For Thal phases $\\{1, 2\\}$.\n- $A2$: For Thal phases $\\{3, 4\\}$.\n- $A3$: For Thal phase $\\{5\\}$.\n\nSince the highest phase is $3$, the case falls into the $A2$ category. The corresponding code is $A_{\\text{code}} = 2$.\n\n**2.3. Determine the CERAD neuritic plaque density score ($C$ score)**\nThis score is based on the maximum NP count in the neocortical regions. The neocortical counts are temporal ($12$), frontal ($6$), parietal ($8$), and occipital ($4$).\nThe maximum of these counts is $\\max(12, 6, 8, 4) = 12$.\n\nWe apply the criteria for the $C$ score:\n- $C0$: count $< 1$.\n- $C1$: count $\\in [1, 5]$.\n- $C2$: count $\\in [6, 15]$.\n- $C3$: count $> 15$.\n\nThe maximum count of $12$ falls in the range $[6, 15]$. Therefore, the CERAD score is $C2$. The corresponding code is $C_{\\text{code}} = 2$.\n\n**2.4. Calculate the probability $p$**\nFirst, we calculate the linear component $z$ of the logistic model using the derived codes: $A_{\\text{code}} = 2$, $B_{\\text{code}} = 3$, and $C_{\\text{code}} = 2$.\nThe formula is $z = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{A}\\,A_{\\text{code}} + \\beta_{B}\\,B_{\\text{code}} + \\beta_{C}\\,C_{\\text{code}}$.\nSubstituting the given coefficients and the derived codes:\n$$\nz = (-2.0) + (0.8)(2) + (1.1)(3) + (0.9)(2)\n$$\n$$\nz = -2.0 + 1.6 + 3.3 + 1.8\n$$\n$$\nz = -2.0 + 6.7\n$$\n$$\nz = 4.7\n$$\nNext, we calculate the probability $p$ using the logistic function:\n$$\np = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-z)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-4.7)}\n$$\nCalculating the value of the exponential term:\n$$\n\\exp(-4.7) \\approx 0.009095204\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the probability formula:\n$$\np \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 0.009095204} = \\frac{1}{1.009095204} \\approx 0.99098616\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final result to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $9, 9, 0, 9$. The fifth significant figure is $8$, which is $\\ge 5$, so we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$\np \\approx 0.9910\n$$\nThe estimated likelihood that the observed Alzheimer-type pathology explains cognitive impairment is $0.9910$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9910}$$", "id": "4997524"}]}
