The provided values for diffusion coefficients, reaction rates, and concentrations are well-established in the field of cellular neurophysiology. The problem asks for a deduction based on the comparison of two characteristic timescales: the time for a calcium ion to diffuse out of a nanodomain ($\\tau_{\\text{escape}}$) and the time for it to be bound by a chelator molecule ($\\tau_{\\text{bind}}$).\n\nThe central principle is as follows: for a chelator to effectively buffer a rapid, localized calcium signal, it must capture the calcium ions before they diffuse away from the signaling domain. This means the characteristic binding time must be shorter than the characteristic escape time, i.e., $\\tau_{\\text{bind}} < \\tau_{\\text{escape}}$. If $\\tau_{\\text{bind}} \\gg \\tau_{\\text{escape}}$, the chelator will be ineffective at controlling the peak calcium concentration within the nanodomain.\n\nFirst, we calculate the characteristic escape time, $\\tau_{\\text{escape}}$, for a calcium ion from a nanodomain of radius $r$. The time dependence of the mean squared displacement for a diffusing particle is given by $\\langle d^2 \\rangle = 2n D t$, where $d$ is the displacement, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $t$ is time and $n$ is the number of dimensions.

The binding reaction is $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+} + \\mathrm{B} \\xrightarrow{k_\\text{on}} \\mathrm{CaB}$. Since the chelator concentration $[B]$ is high ($10\\ \\mathrm{mM}$) and vastly exceeds the transient free calcium concentration, the binding process can be treated as a pseudo-first-order reaction with a rate constant of $k_{\\text{on}} [B]$. The characteristic time for this process is given by the formula provided in the problem statement:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{bind}} = (k_{\\text{on}} [B])^{-1} $$\n\nGiven:\n- Chelator concentration, $[B] = 10\\ \\mathrm{mM} = 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{M}$.\n- On-rate for BAPTA, $k_{\\text{on}}^{\\text{BAPTA}} = 4 \\times 10^8\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- On-rate for EGTA, $k_{\\text{on}}^{\\text{EGTA}} = 1 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nFor BAPTA:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{bind}}^{\\text{BAPTA}} = ((4 \\times 10^8\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{M}))^{-1} = (4 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1})^{-1} = 0.25 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s} = 0.25\\ \\mu\\mathrm{s} $$\n\nFor EGTA:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{bind}}^{\\text{EGTA}} = ((1 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{M}))^{-1} = (1 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1})^{-1} = 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s} = 100\\ \\mu\\mathrm{s} $$\n\nNow, we compare these timescales to deduce the physiological outcome.\n- **For BAPTA**: $\\tau_{\\text{bind}}^{\\text{BAPTA}} = 0.25\\ \\mu\\mathrm{s}$, which is substantially smaller than $\\tau_{\\text{escape}} = 6.25\\ \\mu\\mathrm{s}$. The condition $\\tau_{\\text{bind}} \\ll \\tau_{\\text{escape}}$ is met. This implies that BAPTA molecules will capture calcium ions very rapidly, on a timescale much faster than their diffusion out of the nanodomain. Consequently, BAPTA will strongly suppress the local rise in free $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ near the NMDARs, preventing the activation of CaMKII and thereby blocking the induction of LTP.\n\n- **For EGTA**: $\\tau_{\\text{bind}}^{\\text{EGTA}} = 100\\ \\mu\\mathrm{s}$, which is substantially larger than $\\tau_{\\text{escape}} = 6.25\\ \\mu\\mathrm{s}$.

EGTA is too slow to affect the rapid, localized calcium transient that is critical for LTP induction. Therefore, EGTA will fail to suppress the nanodomain calcium signal and will not block LTP induction.\n\nBased on this analysis, we evaluate the given options.\n\nA. BAPTA will strongly suppress nanodomain $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and block LTP induction, whereas EGTA will not suppress nanodomain $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sufficiently and will fail to block LTP; this difference arises because $k_{\\text{on}}^{\\text{BAPTA}} [B]$ yields $\\tau_{\\text{bind}} \\ll$ the nanodomain escape time, while $k_{\\text{on}}^{\\text{EGTA}} [B]$ yields $\\tau_{\\text{bind}} \\gg$ the escape time.\n- **Evaluation**: This statement entirely and accurately reflects our derivation.

EGTA will block LTP induction whereas BAPTA will not, because EGTA has higher affinity and therefore a more effective $k_{\\text{on}}$ for capturing nanodomain $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$.\n- **Evaluation**: This statement is incorrect on multiple counts. First, it reverses the known and predicted physiological effects. Second, it incorrectly claims EGTA has a \"more effective $k_{\\text{on}}$\"; the provided data explicitly state that BAPTA's $k_{\\text{on}}$ is $400$ times larger than EGTA's. Third, it conflates affinity ($K_d = k_{\\text{off}}/k_{\\text{on}}$) with the on-rate ($k_{\\text{on}}$), which is the kinetically relevant parameter for capturing transient signals.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\nD. Neither BAPTA nor EGTA will affect nanodomain $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sufficiently to alter LTP induction, because the nanodomain transient occurs too fast for any buffer to bind calcium before it diffuses away.\n- **Evaluation**: This statement is partially correct in its assessment of EGTA, but fundamentally incorrect for BAPTA. Our analysis shows that BAPTA is indeed fast enough ($\\tau_{\\text{bind}}^{\\text{BAPTA}} \\ll \\tau_{\\text{escape}}$) to capture calcium within the nanodomain.

Condition 2 (Post) selectively reduces persistence at $180$ minutes, whereas Condition 1 (Pre) reduces both magnitude at $30$ minutes and persistence at $180$ minutes, because protein synthesis is required for both induction triggers and maintenance.", "solution": "Begin from the foundational bases:\n\n1. The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology states that DNA is transcribed to RNA, which is translated into protein. A translation inhibitor such as anisomycin suppresses the synthesis of new proteins during its effective window.\n\n2. The mechanistic distinction between LTP induction and expression is well established. Induction is initiated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent calcium influx during tetanus, activating pre-existing signaling pathways such as calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), protein kinase A, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Early expression (often termed early-phase LTP) arises from modifications to pre-existing proteins, notably phosphorylation of Alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors and their rapid insertion into the postsynaptic membrane, and does not require new protein synthesis. Late expression (late-phase LTP) involves persistent structural and molecular changes, including gene transcription and new protein synthesis (for example, scaffolding proteins and regulators of spine morphology), to maintain potentiation over hours.\n\n3. Anisomycin inhibits ribosomal elongation and thus translation. It does not block NMDA receptor activation, calcium influx, or kinase catalytic activity directly. Therefore, it should not prevent the triggering events of induction nor the early expression that depends on pre-existing proteins. However, if anisomycin is present during the early consolidation window following induction, it should prevent the synthesis of new proteins required to stabilize LTP, leading to a decay of potentiation by late time points (for example, $180$ minutes).\n\nApply this reasoning to the two conditions:\n\n- Condition 1 (Pre): Anisomycin is present from $-10$ minutes to $+20$ minutes relative to the tetanus. During the tetanus, NMDA receptors still open, calcium influx occurs, and kinases are activated because anisomycin does not impair these pre-existing components. Early-phase changes such as AMPA receptor phosphorylation and insertion proceed, yielding a normal or near-control magnitude at $30$ minutes. However, because protein synthesis is inhibited across the induction and immediate post-induction period, the consolidation processes that require new proteins fail. Thus, potentiation decays and is not stably maintained at $180$ minutes.\n\n- Condition 2 (Post): Anisomycin is present from $+10$ minutes to $+40$ minutes after the tetanus. The induction and early expression during the first $10$ minutes post-tetanus occur without translation inhibition, so the $30$ minute magnitude remains near control (early-phase LTP does not require new protein synthesis). Nevertheless, the drug overlaps the early consolidation window during which new proteins are normally synthesized to stabilize changes. Consequently, the maintenance of LTP is compromised, and potentiation fails to persist to $180$ minutes.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. States that in both conditions the $30$ minute magnitude is near control, while the $180$ minute persistence is abolished because maintenance requires protein synthesis within the early consolidation window. This matches the mechanistic derivation: anisomycin does not block induction triggers or early expression, but blocks late-phase maintenance when present during early post-induction intervals. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. Claims that pre-application abolishes induction (no $30$ minute potentiation) and post-application has no effects. This is inconsistent with the base facts: anisomycin does not block NMDA receptor function, calcium entry, or kinase activation; early-phase LTP is protein synthesis-independent. Therefore, pre-application should not abolish the $30$ minute potentiation. Moreover, post-application within $10$ to $40$ minutes after tetanus should disrupt maintenance at $180$ minutes, contrary to the option’s assertion. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. Asserts that pre-application reduces the $30$ minute magnitude by blocking AMPA receptor phosphorylation and that both conditions show intact $180$ minute persistence. Anisomycin does not block phosphorylation of pre-existing proteins or trafficking driven by kinase cascades; rather, it blocks translation. Maintenance at $180$ minutes requires new protein synthesis and should be impaired if anisomycin overlaps the consolidation window. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. Proposes that post-application reduces $180$ minute persistence, whereas pre-application reduces both $30$ and $180$ minute measures, implying protein synthesis is required for induction triggers. This contradicts the mechanistic separation: induction and early expression depend on pre-existing molecules and are protein synthesis-independent. Thus, $30$ minute magnitude should be spared even with pre-application, while $180$ minute persistence should be reduced in both conditions.
