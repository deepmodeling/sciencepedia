By interpreting a classic experimental observation, you will connect the appearance of specific molecular machinery to the functional consolidation of memory at the level of a single dendritic spine [@problem_id:2340591].", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating the cellular mechanisms underlying long-lasting memory formation. They focus on a phenomenon known as Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), which is a persistent strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity. Using a hippocampal slice preparation, they apply strong, high-frequency electrical stimulation to a bundle of axons, targeting a small population of dendritic spines on a postsynaptic neuron. Within 15-20 minutes, using high-resolution electron microscopy, they observe the distinct appearance of polysomes—structures consisting of a single messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule being simultaneously translated by multiple ribosomes—at the base of the stimulated dendritic spines. This observation occurs far too rapidly for new proteins to have been synthesized in the neuron's cell body (soma) and transported down the dendrite to these specific synapses.\n\nBased on this experimental finding, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and significant functional interpretation?\n\nA. The presence of polysomes signifies a mechanism for rapid, localized protein synthesis that allows for the structural and functional consolidation of potentiation at specific, stimulated synapses while leaving neighboring, unstimulated synapses unaltered.\n\nB. The formation of polysomes is a primary retrograde signal, where the clustered ribosomes physically travel back to the nucleus to directly inform it that a strong synaptic event has occurred, thereby initiating a new wave of gene transcription.\n\nC. This finding indicates a global stress response by the neuron. The strong stimulation causes ribosomes to aggregate as a protective measure, temporarily halting all protein synthesis to conserve energy until the cell's metabolic state stabilizes.\n\nD. The polysomes are involved in the rapid degradation of pre-existing, \"silent\" mRNA molecules that are stored in the dendrites, clearing the synaptic machinery to make it receptive to new proteins that will later arrive from the soma.\n\nE. This observation is a direct consequence of increased mitochondrial activity at the synapse. The local surge in ATP production required for potentiation causes ribosomes to non-specifically bind to any available mRNA, a process that is not directly related to memory consolidation.", "solution": "The key observation is the rapid appearance (within 15–20 minutes) of polysomes at the base of stimulated dendritic spines following strong, high-frequency stimulation that induces long-term potentiation. Polysomes are ribosome–mRNA complexes that mark ongoing translation; thus, their presence specifically indicates active protein synthesis rather than a halt in translation. The time course is too fast for proteins synthesized in the soma to be transported down the dendrite to the specific synapses, implying that protein synthesis must be occurring locally within the dendrite near the stimulated spines.\n\nPrinciple 1: Late phases of synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation, require new protein synthesis to stabilize and consolidate changes in synaptic strength. Principle 2: Dendrites house mRNAs and translational machinery, enabling local translation. Principle 3: The input specificity of LTP implies that mechanisms must allow strengthened synapses to selectively acquire stabilizing proteins without affecting neighboring, unstimulated synapses. Local translation at or near activated synapses is a mechanism that satisfies this requirement.\n\nGiven these principles, the localized, stimulus-contingent appearance of polysomes at stimulated spines is best interpreted as synapse-specific, activity-triggered local protein synthesis that supports structural and functional consolidation of LTP at those synapses.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A aligns directly with the observation and known mechanisms: polysomes reflect rapid, localized translation at stimulated synapses, enabling consolidation while sparing neighboring synapses.\n- B is inconsistent: polysomes do not serve as retrograde vehicles to the nucleus; retrograde signaling and nucleus-directed responses occur via signaling molecules and kinase cascades, not by physical transport of ribosome clusters.\n- C contradicts the role of polysomes: a global stress response typically suppresses translation and forms stress granules, whereas polysomes indicate active translation, and the localization to stimulated spines argues against a global suppression.\n- D is incorrect mechanistically: mRNA degradation is associated with processing bodies, not polysomes; polysomes denote translation, not targeted degradation of mRNA.\n- E is not the most accurate: while ATP demand increases locally, the specific, spatially restricted formation of polysomes on mRNAs following activity is a regulated, translation-related process directly tied to synaptic plasticity rather than a nonspecific byproduct of elevated ATP.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and significant functional interpretation is that polysomes at stimulated spines mediate rapid, localized protein synthesis necessary for the synapse-specific consolidation of potentiation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2340591"}, {"introduction": "Lasting memories require the synthesis of new proteins, a process orchestrated by the cell nucleus, but this is far more than a simple \"on\" switch. Consolidation involves precisely timed waves of gene expression and protein activity. This problem investigates the sophisticated regulatory logic behind memory consolidation, revealing the critical and perhaps counterintuitive role of targeted protein *degradation* in permitting long-term changes to endure [@problem_id:2340406].", "problem": "A team of neuroscientists is investigating the molecular mechanisms of memory consolidation using hippocampal brain slices. They induce late-phase Long-Term Potentiation (L-LTP), a cellular correlate of long-term memory, by applying a strong tetanic stimulation to the Schaffer collateral pathway. They confirm that this stimulation successfully triggers an initial wave of gene transcription, which is dependent on the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). This initial wave peaks within the first hour post-stimulation.\n\nIn a key experiment, the researchers apply a potent and specific proteasome inhibitor to the brain slices exactly 60 minutes after the tetanic stimulation. While early-LTP (lasting 1-2 hours) is unaffected, they observe that the potentiation decays back to baseline levels within 3-4 hours, indicating a complete failure of L-LTP consolidation. This occurs even though the initial CREB-dependent gene transcription was successfully completed before the inhibitor was introduced.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and specific molecular explanation for why inhibiting the proteasome at this time point blocks L-LTP consolidation?\n\nA. The proteasome inhibitor blocks the degradation of key synaptic scaffolding proteins like PSD-95, causing their excessive accumulation and leading to excitotoxic collapse of the postsynaptic density.\n\nB. The proteasome is essential for degrading misfolded or damaged proteins. Its inhibition triggers a cellular stress response (the unfolded protein response) that globally shuts down all protein synthesis, including that of proteins required for L-LTP.\n\nC. The initial wave of gene transcription produces not only plasticity-related proteins but also transcriptional repressor proteins. The proteasome is required to degrade these newly synthesized repressors, and its inhibition causes them to accumulate and shut down a second, necessary wave of gene expression.\n\nD. The proteasome directly modifies and activates ribosomes. Inhibiting the proteasome prevents the translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that were produced during the initial wave of transcription, thus blocking the synthesis of essential proteins for synaptic growth.\n\nE. The proteasome is required to degrade the inhibitory subunits of Protein Kinase A (PKA). By inhibiting the proteasome, PKA remains inactive, preventing the phosphorylation of downstream targets that are critical for the structural remodeling of the synapse during L-LTP.", "solution": "We begin by stating the relevant principles for late-phase Long-Term Potentiation (L-LTP) consolidation. L-LTP requires both new gene transcription and new protein synthesis as well as tightly regulated protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The initial wave of activity-dependent transcription, often CREB-dependent, occurs within the first hour and produces a mixture of products, including plasticity-related proteins and negative regulators (repressors) that serve as a feedback control. Consolidation later requires a second coordinated wave of gene expression and protein synthesis, which depends not only on the availability of mRNAs but also on the selective removal of inhibitory regulators produced during or shortly after the first wave. The proteasome is therefore necessary to degrade specific negative regulators to permit sustained signaling, transcription, and structural remodeling underlying L-LTP.\n\nIn the experiment, the proteasome inhibitor is applied at 60 minutes, after the first CREB-dependent transcriptional wave has been completed. Early-LTP remains intact, consistent with the idea that immediate early translation and post-translational mechanisms driving early potentiation are not critically dependent on proteasomal degradation at that moment. However, L-LTP subsequently fails, indicating a block in the processes required for consolidation, which rely on regulated degradation.\n\nWe now evaluate each option:\n\nA. Proposes that blocking proteasome causes excessive accumulation of synaptic scaffolds like PSD-95, leading to excitotoxic collapse. This is not a recognized immediate, specific mechanism for loss of L-LTP with proteasome inhibition at this time point, and accumulation of PSD-95 would not be expected to acutely collapse the postsynaptic density within hours in this paradigm.\n\nB. Suggests that proteasome inhibition broadly triggers an unfolded protein response shutting down all protein synthesis. This is overly global and nonspecific. Furthermore, since early-LTP remains intact and the inhibitor is applied at 60 minutes, an immediate, global cessation of translation is not supported by the temporal specificity typically observed in these preparations. The prototypical explanation for UPS dependence in L-LTP is targeted degradation, not an indiscriminate shutdown of protein synthesis.\n\nC. States that the initial wave produces both plasticity-related proteins and repressors; the proteasome is required to degrade these newly synthesized repressors; inhibition causes their accumulation, shutting down a second, necessary wave of gene expression. This precisely matches the established model in which consolidation requires proteasome-mediated removal of negative regulators (including CREB repressors) to permit continued transcriptional programs and plasticity-related expression necessary for L-LTP stabilization. Applying the inhibitor after the first wave allows that wave to occur but prevents the required clearance of repressors, thereby blocking subsequent gene expression and consolidation.\n\nD. Claims the proteasome directly modifies and activates ribosomes. This is incorrect; the proteasome does not directly activate ribosomes to permit translation.\n\nE. Claims the proteasome must degrade inhibitory subunits of Protein Kinase A to activate PKA. PKA activation is classically controlled by cAMP binding to regulatory subunits, not by proteasomal degradation. Thus, this mechanism is not accurate for the observed effect.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and specific explanation consistent with the timing, the known dual requirement for protein synthesis and selective protein degradation in L-LTP, and the preservation of early-LTP is that proteasome inhibition prevents the removal of newly synthesized repressors required to permit a second necessary wave of gene expression required for consolidation, as described in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2340406"}, {"introduction": "The stable strength of a synapse can be viewed as a dynamic equilibrium, where receptors are constantly being added and removed.

The dominant determinants of the number of surface $\\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) at the synapse are exocytotic insertion from an intracellular pool, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and lateral diffusion away from the synapse into the surrounding membrane. Assume the following conditions hold over the timescale of interest for late-LTP: (i) the intracellular AMPAR pool is large enough that its depletion does not significantly affect the exocytosis rate, (ii) endocytosis acts with first-order kinetics with respect to the synaptic AMPAR number, and (iii) lateral diffusion away from the synapse is well-approximated by a first-order loss term proportional to the synaptic AMPAR number.

There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no invalidating flaws. Therefore, it is deemed **valid**, and a full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the construction of a dynamical model for the number of synaptic AMPARs, $N(t)$, based on the principle of conservation. This principle states that the rate of change of $N(t)$ equals the rate of inflow minus the rate of outflow.\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of Inflow}) - (\\text{Rate of Outflow})\n$$\n\nThe inflow process is exocytotic insertion. The problem states that the intracellular pool is non-depleting, which implies the exocytosis rate is a constant, $k_{\\mathrm{exo}}$, with units of receptors/time. This is a zero-order influx term.\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Inflow} = k_{\\mathrm{exo}}\n$$\n\nThe outflow processes are endocytosis and lateral diffusion. Both are assumed to follow first-order kinetics with respect to the number of synaptic receptors, $N(t)$.\n- The rate of endocytosis is $k_{\\mathrm{endo}}N(t)$.\n- The rate of lateral diffusion away from the synapse is $k_{\\mathrm{diff}}N(t)$.\n\nThe total rate of outflow is the sum of these two rates:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Outflow} = k_{\\mathrm{endo}}N(t) + k_{\\mathrm{diff}}N(t) = (k_{\\mathrm{endo}} + k_{\\mathrm{diff}})N(t)\n$$\n\nCombining the inflow and outflow terms, we obtain the ordinary differential equation (ODE) governing $N(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{exo}} - (k_{\\mathrm{endo}} + k_{\\mathrm{diff}})N(t)\n$$\n\nThe steady-state solution, $N_{\\mathrm{ss}}$, is found by setting the time derivative to zero, $\\frac{dN}{dt} = 0$:\n$$\n0 = k_{\\mathrm{exo}} - (k_{\\mathrm{endo}} + k_{\\mathrm{diff}})N_{\\mathrm{ss}}\n$$\nSolving for $N_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ yields:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{exo}}}{k_{\\mathrm{endo}} + k_{\\mathrm{diff}}}\n$$\n\nThe stability of this steady-state solution can be determined by examining the ODE. Let $f(N) = k_{\\mathrm{exo}} - (k_{\\mathrm{endo}} + k_{\\mathrm{diff}})N$. The derivative is $\\frac{df}{dN} = -(k_{\\mathrm{endo}} + k_{\\mathrm{diff}})$. Since the rate constants $k_{\\mathrm{endo}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{diff}}$ are physically meaningful rates, they must be positive. Thus, $-(k_{\\mathrm{endo}} + k_{\\mathrm{diff}})  0$. A negative derivative at the fixed point indicates that the steady state is stable. Any small perturbation from $N_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ will decay exponentially back to $N_{\\mathrm{ss}}$.\n\nNow, we compute the steady-state AMPAR numbers for the baseline (pre-LTP) and late-LTP conditions.\n\n**Baseline (base) condition:**\nThe parameters are given as:\n$k_{\\mathrm{exo,base}} = 10 \\text{ receptors/min}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{endo,base}} = 0.10 \\text{ min}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{diff,base}} = 0.05 \\text{ min}^{-1}$\n\nThe steady-state number of receptors at baseline is:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{ss,base}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{exo,base}}}{k_{\\mathrm{endo,base}} + k_{\\mathrm{diff,base}}} = \\frac{10}{0.10 + 0.05} = \\frac{10}{0.15} \\text{ receptors}\n$$\n\n**Late-LTP (LTP) condition:**\nThe parameters are modified as follows:\n- $k_{\\mathrm{exo,LTP}}$ is $50\\%$ greater than baseline: $k_{\\mathrm{exo,LTP}} = 1.5 \\times k_{\\mathrm{exo,base}} = 1.5 \\times 10 = 15 \\text{ receptors/min}$.\n- $k_{\\mathrm{endo,LTP}}$ is $20\\%$ less than baseline: $k_{\\mathrm{endo,LTP}} = (1 - 0.20) \\times k_{\\mathrm{endo,base}} = 0.8 \\times 0.10 = 0.08 \\text{ min}^{-1}$.\n- $k_{\\mathrm{diff,LTP}}$ is unchanged: $k_{\\mathrm{diff,LTP}} = k_{\\mathrm{diff,base}} = 0.05 \\text{ min}^{-1}$.\n\nThe steady-state number of receptors during late-LTP is:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{ss,LTP}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{exo,LTP}}}{k_{\\mathrm{endo,LTP}} + k_{\\mathrm{diff,LTP}}} = \\frac{15}{0.08 + 0.05} = \\frac{15}{0.13} \\text{ receptors}\n$$\n\n**Fold-change calculation:**\nThe problem asks for the fold-change $F = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{ss,LTP}}}{N_{\\mathrm{ss,base}}}$.\n$$\nF = \\frac{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{exo,LTP}}}{k_{\\mathrm{endo,LTP}} + k_{\\mathrm{diff,LTP}}}}{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{exo,base}}}{k_{\\mathrm{endo,base}} + k_{\\mathrm{diff,base}}}} = \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{exo,LTP}}}{k_{\\mathrm{exo,base}}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{endo,base}} + k_{\\mathrm{diff,base}}}{k_{\\mathrm{endo,LTP}} + k_{\\mathrm{diff,LTP}}} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nF = \\left( \\frac{15}{10} \\right) \\left( \\frac{0.10 + 0.05}{0.08 + 0.05} \\right) = 1.5 \\times \\frac{0.15}{0.13}\n$$\n$$\nF = 1.5 \\times \\frac{15}{13} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 15}{13} = \\frac{22.5}{13}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\nF = 1.73076923...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required:\n$$\nF \\approx 1.731\n$$\nThis result indicates that the specified changes in trafficking rates during late-LTP lead to an approximately $73.1\\%$ increase in the steady-state number of synaptic AMPA receptors, thereby potentiating the synapse.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.731}$$", "id": "5004483"}]}
