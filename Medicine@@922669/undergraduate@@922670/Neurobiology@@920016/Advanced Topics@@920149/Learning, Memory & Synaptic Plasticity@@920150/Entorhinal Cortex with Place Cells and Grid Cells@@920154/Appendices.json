Its phase at time $t$ is:\n$$\n\\Phi_{\\theta}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} f_{\\theta} \\,dt' = f_{\\theta} t\n$$\nwhere we have set the initial phase at $t=0$ to zero without loss of generality.\n\nThe animal moves at a constant speed $v$ along the VCO's preferred direction.

The problem is a valid theoretical exploration.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated question in theoretical neuroscience that combines principles of neural dynamics and differential geometry. I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe core of the problem lies in the attempt to tile a curved surface with a lattice structure—a hexagonal grid—that is naturally flat (i.e., its natural embedding space is the Euclidean plane, with Gaussian curvature $K=0$). The mismatch between the local flatness of the hexagonal pattern and the global curvature of the surface necessitates either metric distortions or topological defects. The problem states the CAN maintains an intrinsic geodesic spacing of $\\lambda$, which implies the system attempts to preserve local metric properties. Consequently, topological defects must arise.\n\nThe relationship between local geometry and global topology is governed by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. For a closed surface $S$, the theorem states:\n$$ \\int_S K \\, dA = 2\\pi \\chi(S) $$\nwhere $K$ is the Gaussian curvature and $\\chi(S)$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface, a topological invariant. For a tiling of a surface, the Euler characteristic can also be expressed combinatorially as $\\chi = V - E + F$, where $V$, $E$, and $F$ are the number of vertices, edges, and faces, respectively.\n\n_**Defects in Tiling:**_\nA perfect hexagonal tiling has each vertex with a coordination number (number of neighbors) of $z=6$. Such a tiling can perfectly tile a plane ($K=0, \\chi=0$ for any simple finite patch). When tiling a curved surface, vertices with $z \\neq 6$ must be introduced. These are called disclinations. The topological charge of a disclination is related to the deviation from hexagonal coordination, often defined as $q_i = (6 - z_i)/c$ for some constant $c$. The discrete form of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem relates the total topological charge of defects to the Euler characteristic of the surface. For a graph of trivalent vertices (as in a hexagonal tiling), this relationship is often given as $\\sum_i (6-z_i) = 6\\chi$.\n\n_**Case 1: The Sphere**_\n- **Curvature and Topology:** A sphere has constant positive Gaussian curvature $K = 1/R^2 > 0$. It is a closed surface with an Euler characteristic of $\\chi = 2$.\n- **Topological Defects:** To tile a sphere with a locally hexagonal grid, the total topological charge must be $\\sum (6-z_i) = 6 \\chi = 6(2) = +12$. This requires a net positive charge, which is achieved by introducing vertices with coordination number $z < 6$. The most common defect is a $5$-fold coordinated field (a pentamer), which contributes a charge of $6-5 = +1$. Thus, a tiling of a sphere with hexagons requires at a minimum twelve $5$-fold defects, as famously seen on a soccer ball (a truncated icosahedron, with $12$ pentagonal faces and $20$ hexagonal faces). The average coordination number must be less than $6$.\n- **Geometric Effects:** The circumference of a geodesic circle of radius $r$ on a sphere is $C(r) = 2\\pi R \\sin(r/R)$. For small $r$, the Taylor expansion is $C(r) \\approx 2\\pi r - \\frac{\\pi r^3}{3R^2} + \\dots$, which is less than the Euclidean circumference $2\\pi r$. This means that the number of grid fields that can fit on a circle of geodesic radius $r$ is less than would be expected on a flat plane.\n- **Holonomy:** When a vector is parallel-transported around a closed loop on a curved surface, it undergoes a rotation known as holonomy. The angle of rotation $\\Delta\\alpha$ is given by the integral of the Gaussian curvature over the area $A$ enclosed by the loop: $\\Delta\\alpha = \\int_A K \\, dA$. Since $K > 0$ on the sphere, a grid cell module's orientation would rotate upon traversing a closed path. For constant $K$, $\\Delta\\alpha = K \\cdot \\text{Area}$.\n\n_**Case 2: The Hyperbolic Plane**_\n- **Curvature and Topology:** A hyperbolic plane has constant negative Gaussian curvature $K = -1/R^2 < 0$. It is an open, non-compact surface. While the global Gauss-Bonnet theorem for closed surfaces doesn't apply directly, the local implications of negative curvature are clear.\n- **Topological Defects:** The negative curvature requires a net negative topological charge to tile the surface. This is achieved by introducing vertices with coordination number $z > 6$. The most common defect would be a $7$-fold coordinated field (a heptamer), which contributes a charge of $6-7 = -1$. The average coordination number must be greater than $6$.\n- **Geometric Effects:** The circumference of a geodesic circle of radius $r$ on this hyperbolic plane is $C(r) = 2\\pi R \\sinh(r/R)$. For small $r$, the Taylor expansion is $C(r) \\approx 2\\pi r + \\frac{\\pi r^3}{3R^2} + \\dots$, which is greater than the Euclidean circumference $2\\pi r$. In fact, this circumference grows exponentially with $r$. Consequently, the number of grid fields encountered along a geodesic circle grows faster than linearly with its geodesic radius.\n- **Holonomy:** The holonomy is again given by $\\Delta\\alpha = \\int_A K \\, dA$. Since $K < 0$ on the hyperbolic plane, the holonomy is non-zero and has the opposite sign to that on the sphere. The grid orientation will rotate in the opposite direction when traversing a closed loop.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. On the sphere, grid fields tend to have mostly $7$ neighbors at near-equal geodesic distances and spacing that shrinks with geodesic radius, whereas on the hyperbolic plane they tend to have mostly $5$ neighbors and spacing that grows with geodesic radius.**\n- Analysis: This statement incorrectly reverses the roles of the defects. Positive curvature (sphere) requires defects with fewer than $6$ neighbors (e.g., $5$), while negative curvature (hyperbolic plane) requires defects with more than $6$ neighbors (e.g., $7$).\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. On the sphere, the pattern remains locally hexagonal in geodesic distance but must include positive disclinations (e.g., $5$-fold coordinated fields) with a net topological charge equivalent to $+12$ on a closed sphere, and grid orientation exhibits holonomy proportional to enclosed area; on the hyperbolic plane, the average coordination exceeds $6$ (e.g., $7$-fold neighbors are common), the number of fields encountered along a geodesic circle grows faster than linearly with its geodesic radius, and orientation holonomy has opposite sign.**\n- Analysis:\n    - **Sphere:** The description is entirely correct. It correctly identifies the need for positive disclinations ($5$-fold), correctly states the total charge required on a closed sphere ($+12$), and correctly describes the existence of orientation holonomy.\n    - **Hyperbolic Plane:** The description is also entirely correct. It correctly states that the average coordination must exceed $6$ ($7$-fold neighbors), that the number of fields on a geodesic circle grows faster than linearly (due to $C(r) \\propto \\sinh(r/R)$), and that the holonomy has the opposite sign compared to the sphere (since $K$ has the opposite sign).\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Because the CAN integrates in intrinsic coordinates, the embedding is irrelevant: both the sphere and the hyperbolic plane admit a perfect, infinite, defect-free hexagonal lattice with exactly $6$ neighbors everywhere and uniform orientation.**\n- Analysis: This statement contains a fundamental misunderstanding. While the extrinsic embedding in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is irrelevant, the *intrinsic geometry* (defined by the metric and curvature) is precisely what the CAN integrates on. A perfect, defect-free hexagonal lattice is a Euclidean object ($K=0$). It is mathematically impossible to tile a surface with non-zero curvature ($K \\neq 0$) with such a lattice without metric distortion or topological defects. The existence of curvature fundamentally prevents a defect-free hexagonal tiling and global uniform orientation.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. On the hyperbolic plane, the number of fields encountered along a geodesic circle increases more slowly than linearly with geodesic radius, yielding fewer than $6$ neighbors on average, while on the sphere it increases faster than linearly, yielding more than $6$ neighbors on average; orientation remains globally constant on both surfaces.**\n- Analysis: This statement makes multiple errors, reversing the properties of the two surfaces.\n    - On the hyperbolic plane, the circumference grows *faster* than linearly, requiring *more* than $6$ neighbors on average.\n    - On the sphere, the circumference grows *slower* than linearly, requiring *fewer* than $6$ neighbors on average.\n    - The claim that orientation remains globally constant is false; holonomy is a direct consequence of non-zero curvature.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5015199"}]}
