I will now proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Derivation\nThe goal is to find the normalized activity, $\\frac{A(x)}{A_{\\max}}$. According to the problem statement, this is the fraction of catalytic subunits that are free. Catalytic subunits are released only when the holoenzyme is fully saturated with cAMP, meaning both regulatory subunits, $R_1$ and $R_2$, have cAMP bound to both of their respective sites, $A$ and $B$. Therefore, the fraction of free catalytic subunits is equivalent to the fraction of PKA holoenzymes that are in this fully saturated state.\n\nLet's denote the free cAMP concentration as $x$. The two regulatory subunits, $R$, are identical and bind cAMP independently. This crucial simplification allows us to first determine the binding properties of a single $R$ subunit and then extend the result to the dimeric $R_2$ complex.\n\nConsider a single regulatory subunit, $R$. It can exist in four distinct states with respect to cAMP binding:\n1.  $R$: The unbound state.\n2.  $R_A$: cAMP bound only to site $A$.\n3.  $R_B$: cAMP bound only to site $B$.\n4.  $R_{AB}$: cAMP bound to both site $A$ and site $B$.\n\nLet's define the equilibrium relationships for these states based on the law of mass action and the given dissociation constants.\nThe binding of the first cAMP molecule to an unbound $R$ subunit is described by:\n$R + x \\rightleftharpoons R_A$, with dissociation constant $K_A = \\frac{[R]x}{[R_A]}$.\n$R + x \\rightleftharpoons R_B$, with dissociation constant $K_B = \\frac{[R]x}{[R_B]}$.\n\nFrom these, we can express the concentrations of the singly-occupied states in terms of the unbound state concentration $[R]$:\n$[R_A] = \\frac{[R]x}{K_A}$\n$[R_B] = \\frac{[R]x}{K_B}$\n\nNext, we consider the binding of the second cAMP molecule. Due to positive cooperativity, the dissociation constants are modified by a factor $\\alpha$.\nFor the formation of the doubly-occupied state, $R_{AB}$:\n$R_A + x \\rightleftharpoons R_{AB}$, with dissociation constant $K_{B,eff} = \\frac{K_B}{\\alpha}$. Thus, $\\frac{K_B}{\\alpha} = \\frac{[R_A]x}{[R_{AB}]}$.\n$R_B + x \\rightleftharpoons R_{AB}$, with dissociation constant $K_{A,eff} = \\frac{K_A}{\\alpha}$. Thus, $\\frac{K_A}{\\alpha} = \\frac{[R_B]x}{[R_{AB}]}$.\n\nUsing these relationships, we can express the concentration of the doubly-occupied state, $[R_{AB}]$, in terms of $[R]$:\nFrom the first path: $[R_{AB}] = \\frac{[R_A]x}{K_B/\\alpha} = \\frac{(\\frac{[R]x}{K_A})x}{K_B/\\alpha} = \\frac{\\alpha [R]x^2}{K_A K_B}$.\nFrom the second path: $[R_{AB}] = \\frac{[R_B]x}{K_A/\\alpha} = \\frac{(\\frac{[R]x}{K_B})x}{K_A/\\alpha} = \\frac{\\alpha [R]x^2}{K_A K_B}$.\nBoth paths yield the same expression, confirming the thermodynamic consistency of the model.\n\nThe total concentration of a single regulatory subunit, $[R_{total}]$, is the sum of the concentrations of all its possible states:\n$[R_{total}] = [R] + [R_A] + [R_B] + [R_{AB}]$\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of $[R]$:\n$[R_{total}] = [R] + \\frac{[R]x}{K_A} + \\frac{[R]x}{K_B} + \\frac{\\alpha [R]x^2}{K_A K_B}$\n$[R_{total}] = [R] \\left( 1 + \\frac{x}{K_A} + \\frac{x}{K_B} + \\frac{\\alpha x^2}{K_A K_B} \\right)$\n\nThe fraction of regulatory subunits that are fully occupied, $f_{R_{AB}}$, is the ratio of the concentration of the doubly-occupied state to the total concentration of the subunit:\n$f_{R_{AB}} = \\frac{[R_{AB}]}{[R_{total}]} = \\frac{[R] \\left( \\frac{\\alpha x^2}{K_A K_B} \\right)}{[R] \\left( 1 + \\frac{x}{K_A} + \\frac{x}{K_B} + \\frac{\\alpha x^2}{K_A K_B} \\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{\\alpha x^2}{K_A K_B}}{1 + \\frac{x}{K_A} + \\frac{x}{K_B} + \\frac{\\alpha x^2}{K_A K_B}}$\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $K_A K_B$:\n$f_{R_{AB}} = \\frac{\\alpha x^2}{K_A K_B + K_B x + K_A x + \\alpha x^2} = \\frac{\\alpha x^2}{K_A K_B + (K_A + K_B)x + \\alpha x^2}$\n\nNow, we return to the full $R_2C_2$ holoenzyme. The enzyme is active only when both regulatory subunits are in the fully occupied $R_{AB}$ state. Since the two subunits bind cAMP independently, the probability of the holoenzyme being fully saturated is the product of the individual probabilities for each subunit. Let $P(R_1 \\text{ is } R_{AB})$ be the probability for the first subunit and $P(R_2 \\text{ is } R_{AB})$ be the probability for the second.\n$P(R_1 \\text{ is } R_{AB}) = P(R_2 \\text{ is } R_{AB}) = f_{R_{AB}}$.\n\nThe probability that both are saturated is:\n$P(\\text{holoenzyme is active}) = P(R_1 \\text{ is } R_{AB}) \\times P(R_2 \\text{ is } R_{AB}) = (f_{R_{AB}})^2$.\n\nThis probability represents the fraction of the total enzyme pool that is active, which is, by definition, the normalized activity $\\frac{A(x)}{A_{\\max}}$.\nTherefore,\n$\\frac{A(x)}{A_{\\max}} = \\left( f_{R_{AB}} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\alpha x^2}{K_A K_B + (K_A + K_B)x + \\alpha x^2} \\right)^2$.\n\nThis is the final, closed-form analytic expression for the normalized activity as a function of $x$, $K_A$, $K_B$, and $\\alpha$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{\\alpha x^{2}}{K_{A} K_{B} + (K_{A} + K_{B})x + \\alpha x^{2}}\\right)^{2}}\n$$", "id": "5053598"}, {"introduction": "Once activated, kinases exert their influence by phosphorylating target proteins, such as ion channels.

At glutamatergic synapses, this timing dependence arises from the calcium control hypothesis: the postsynaptic calcium concentration, driven primarily by N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated influx, is transformed by the competitive and cooperative actions of Calcium/Calmodulin-dependent Protein Kinase II (CaMKII) and Protein Phosphatase 2B (PP2B, calcineurin) together with Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1).

The problem states that LTP is driven by CaMKII and LTD is driven by the PP2B/PP1 pathway. The pharmacological agent inhibits PP2B. It is also explicitly stated that CaMKII and NMDARs (the source of calcium) are unaffected. Therefore, the inhibition should selectively impact the LTD process, leaving the LTP process unchanged. This means the LTP lobe of the STDP window, described by $A_{+}$ and $\\tau_{+}$, will remain the same. The LTD lobe, described by $A_{-}$ and $\\tau_{-}$, will be altered. The problem assumes that the reduced activity of PP2B (to a fraction $k=0.4$) results in a scaling of both the amplitude and the time constant of the LTD window: $A_{-} \\to k\\,A_{-}$ and $\\tau_{-} \\to k\\,\\tau_{-}$. This premise dictates that the LTD lobe becomes both smaller in magnitude (attenuated) and shorter in its temporal extent (narrowed).\n\nNext, we calculate the signed area $S$. The integral of the STDP window is given by:\n$$S = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\Delta w(\\Delta t)\\, d\\Delta t = \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} \\Delta w(\\Delta t)\\, d\\Delta t + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\Delta w(\\Delta t)\\, d\\Delta t$$\nThe integral of the LTP lobe (for $\\Delta t > 0$) is:\n$$S_{+} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} A_{+}\\exp(-\\Delta t/\\tau_{+})\\, d\\Delta t = A_{+}[-\\tau_{+}\\exp(-\\Delta t/\\tau_{+})]_{0}^{\\infty} = A_{+}(0 - (-\\tau_{+}e^{0})) = A_{+}\\tau_{+}$$\nThe integral of the LTD lobe (for $\\Delta t < 0$) is:\n$$S_{-} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} -A_{-}\\exp(\\Delta t/\\tau_{-})\\, d\\Delta t = -A_{-}[\\tau_{-}\\exp(\\Delta t/\\tau_{-})]_{-\\infty}^{0} = -A_{-}(\\tau_{-}e^{0} - 0) = -A_{-}\\tau_{-}$$\nThe total signed area is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$S = S_{+} + S_{-} = A_{+}\\tau_{+} - A_{-}\\tau_{-}$$\n\nNow, we compute $S$ for the baseline and inhibited conditions.\n\n**Baseline Condition:**\nUsing the given parameters: $A_{+} = 1.0$, $\\tau_{+} = 20\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, $A_{-} = 0.5$, $\\tau_{-} = 60\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\nThe area of the LTP lobe is $S_{baseline, +} = (1.0) \\times (20\\,\\mathrm{ms}) = 20$ (arbitrary units $\\times$ ms).\nThe area of the LTD lobe is $S_{baseline, -} = -(0.5) \\times (60\\,\\mathrm{ms}) = -30$ (arbitrary units $\\times$ ms).\nThe total signed area at baseline is:\n$$S_{baseline} = S_{baseline, +} + S_{baseline, -} = 20 - 30 = -10 \\text{ (arbitrary units} \\times \\text{ms)}$$\nThe negative sign indicates that, integrated over all spike timings, the baseline synapse has a net bias toward depression.\n\n**Inhibited Condition:**\nThe inhibition factor is $k = 0.4$. The LTP parameters are unchanged: $A'_{+} = A_{+} = 1.0$ and $\\tau'_{+} = \\tau_{+} = 20\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\nThe new LTD parameters are:\n$A'_{-} = k\\,A_{-} = 0.4 \\times 0.5 = 0.2$\n$\\tau'_{-} = k\\,\\tau_{-} = 0.4 \\times 60\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 24\\,\\mathrm{ms}$\nThe area of the LTP lobe remains the same: $S_{inhibited, +} = A'_{+}\\tau'_{+} = 20$ (arbitrary units $\\times$ ms).\nThe new area of the LTD lobe is:\n$$S_{inhibited, -} = -A'_{-}\\tau'_{-} = -(0.2) \\times (24\\,\\mathrm{ms}) = -4.8 \\text{ (arbitrary units} \\times \\text{ms)}$$\nThe total signed area under inhibition is:\n$$S_{inhibited} = S_{inhibited, +} + S_{inhibited, -} = 20 - 4.8 = 15.2 \\text{ (arbitrary units} \\times \\text{ms)}$$\nThe total signed area changes from $S_{baseline} = -10$ to $S_{inhibited} = 15.2$. The sign flips from negative to positive. This represents a fundamental shift in the balance of plasticity. The synapse, which was biased towards depression, is now strongly biased towards potentiation. The \"skew\" of the function $\\Delta w(\\Delta t)$ has shifted from being dominated by the negative (LTD) lobe to being dominated by the positive (LTP) lobe, which can be described as a right-skew towards potentiation.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. PP2B inhibition reduces both $A_{-}$ and $\\tau_{-}$, selectively narrowing and attenuating the LTD lobe while leaving the LTP lobe unchanged; the signed area $S$ becomes positive, indicating a right-skew toward potentiation dominated $\\Delta w(\\Delta t)$.**\nThis option correctly describes the mechanism based on the problem statement: selective action on the LTD lobe by reducing both $A_{-}$ and $\\tau_{-}$. It correctly predicts that the LTP lobe is unchanged. The quantitative prediction matches our derivation perfectly: the signed area $S$ changes from negative ($-10$) to positive ($15.2$), indicating a shift toward a potentiation-dominated (right-skewed) window.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. PP2B inhibition reduces $A_{+}$ and $\\tau_{+}$ by diminishing NMDAR-driven calcium transients, selectively narrowing the LTP lobe; the signed area $S$ becomes more negative, indicating a left-skew toward depression dominated $\\Delta w(\\Delta t)$.**\nThis option is incorrect on multiple grounds. The mechanism described contradicts the problem statement, which explicitly says CaMKII (LTP pathway) and NMDARs are not directly affected by the inhibitor. The inhibition is of PP2B, which mediates LTD. The prediction that $S$ becomes more negative is the opposite of what was calculated.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. PP2B inhibition proportionally narrows both LTP and LTD lobes ($A_{\\pm}$ and $\\tau_{\\pm}$ scale together) such that the total signed area $S$ is unchanged and the window remains symmetric.**\nThis option incorrectly claims that both lobes are affected. The inhibition is selective for the LTD pathway. The claim that the signed area $S$ is unchanged is false, as our calculation shows a dramatic change from $-10$ to $15.2$. The window is not symmetric in either the baseline or the inhibited case.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. PP2B inhibition reduces $A_{-}$ but prolongs $\\tau_{-}$ by slowing dephosphorylation kinetics, thereby broadening the LTD lobe; the signed area $S$ becomes more negative, increasing the depression bias.**\nThis option correctly identifies that $A_{-}$ would be reduced. However, it incorrectly claims that $\\tau_{-}$ is prolonged, which contradicts the problem's explicit assumption that $\\tau_{-} \\to k\\,\\tau_{-}$ with $k < 1$ (a shortening). The prediction that $S$ becomes more negative is also contrary to the calculation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5053611"}]}
