This process depends on two key components: a local \"tag\" to mark an active synapse, and a cell-wide synthesis of plasticity-related proteins (PRPs). This first exercise [@problem_id:2351876] challenges you to apply this core principle to understand why a weak stimulation, which successfully sets a tag, is insufficient on its own to consolidate a lasting memory trace.", "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating synaptic plasticity in an isolated hippocampal neuron. They apply a weak tetanic stimulation (WTS) to a single dendritic spine, which we'll call Synapse A. This stimulation is sufficient to induce a temporary increase in synaptic strength, known as early-phase Long-Term Potentiation (E-LTP), which fades away after approximately two hours. According to the synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis, this weak stimulation successfully creates a \"synaptic tag\" at Synapse A. However, the more permanent, protein synthesis-dependent late-phase Long-Term Potentiation (L-LTP) does not occur.\n\nAccording to the synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis, which of the following is the primary reason that the weak stimulation at Synapse A, by itself, is insufficient to induce L-LTP?\n\nA. The WTS is insufficient to trigger the somatic synthesis of new plasticity-related proteins (PRPs) necessary for the structural and functional changes of L-LTP.\n\nB. The WTS fails to generate a synaptic tag at Synapse A; tags are only created by strong, L-LTP-inducing stimuli.\n\nC. The E-LTP induced by the WTS is mediated by a different set of receptors than L-LTP, making the synapse ineligible for protein capture.\n\nD. The WTS activates local protein degradation pathways that immediately destroy the synaptic tag before any proteins can be captured.\n\nE. The WTS does not lead to the initial influx of calcium through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors required for any form of potentiation.", "solution": "We apply the synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis. The key principles are:\n- A weak tetanic stimulation (WTS) at a synapse can induce early-phase LTP (E-LTP) and set a synaptic tag at that synapse.\n- Late-phase LTP (L-LTP) requires newly synthesized plasticity-related proteins (PRPs), typically generated by strong stimulation that engages somatic transcription and translation processes. These PRPs are then available for capture by tagged synapses to stabilize long-term changes.\n- A weak stimulation alone generally does not trigger the somatic synthesis of PRPs; thus, although a tag is set, there are no PRPs to capture, and only E-LTP is expressed and then decays.\n\nApplying this to Synapse A:\n- The WTS is sufficient to create a synaptic tag and induce E-LTP that fades after approximately two hours, consistent with the absence of PRP capture.\n- Since no strong, protein-synthesis-inducing event occurred, the pool of PRPs is not generated, and L-LTP is not established at Synapse A.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- A is correct: WTS fails to trigger somatic synthesis of PRPs, so the tag cannot capture proteins and L-LTP does not occur.\n- B is incorrect: weak stimulation can create synaptic tags; tags are not exclusive to strong stimuli.\n- C is incorrect: eligibility for capture is determined by the tag, not a fundamentally different receptor set for E-LTP versus L-LTP.\n- D is incorrect: the hypothesis does not posit that weak stimulation activates immediate tag-destroying degradation; rather, the limitation is lack of PRPs.\n- E is incorrect: E-LTP did occur, implying the necessary NMDA receptor-mediated calcium influx was present.\n\nTherefore, the primary reason is the lack of PRP synthesis following WTS.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2351876"}, {"introduction": "Having established that both a synaptic tag and newly synthesized proteins are required for lasting plasticity, we now consider the logistics of this process within a complex, branching neuron. Plasticity-related proteins (PRPs) are often synthesized in the cell body, potentially far from the distant synapses that need them. This problem [@problem_id:1747519] presents a thought experiment using a hypothetical drug that blocks cellular transport, testing your understanding of how these critical proteins are delivered to the correct location for capture.", "problem": "A neurophysiologist is investigating the molecular basis of memory using the Synaptic Tagging and Capture (STC) hypothesis as a theoretical framework. The STC hypothesis provides a mechanism for synapse-specific long-term memory storage. It posits that a strong, L-LTP-inducing stimulus sets a local, transient \"synaptic tag\" at the stimulated synapse and also triggers the synthesis of new Plasticity-Related Proteins (PRPs) in the neuron's soma. These PRPs are then transported throughout the dendritic tree. Only synapses that have been \"tagged\" can capture these PRPs, an event which consolidates transient potentiation into stable, Long-Term Potentiation (L-LTP), the late phase which lasts for many hours. A weak stimulus, which normally only induces a transient Early-LTP (E-LTP) lasting 1-2 hours, is sufficient to set a tag but not to trigger PRP synthesis.\n\nConsider a single pyramidal neuron with two distinct and spatially separated dendritic synapses, S1 and S2. The researcher performs an experiment under a specific condition: the neuron is continuously bathed in a solution containing a drug that selectively and completely inhibits the function of kinesin, a motor protein essential for anterograde transport of cargo from the soma out into the dendrites.\n\nThe experimental protocol is as follows:\n1.  At time $t=0$, synapse S1 is subjected to a weak tetanic stimulation, a protocol that would normally induce only E-LTP.\n2.  At time $t=5$ minutes, synapse S2 is subjected to a strong tetanic stimulation, a protocol that would normally induce L-LTP.\n\nBased on the STC hypothesis and the experimental conditions, what is the most likely fate of the synaptic strength at synapse S1 when measured 8 hours after the initial stimulation?\n\nA. S1 will exhibit a transient potentiation that decays back to its initial baseline strength within a few hours.\n\nB. S1 will undergo robust and stable Long-Term Potentiation (L-LTP).\n\nC. S1 will show no change in synaptic strength at any point, as the weak stimulus is subthreshold for any form of plasticity.\n\nD. S1 will undergo Long-Term Depression (LTD), resulting in a stable decrease in its synaptic strength.", "solution": "We apply the Synaptic Tagging and Capture (STC) hypothesis step by step under the specified constraint of blocked anterograde transport.\n\n1) Core STC principles relevant here:\n- A strong stimulus sets a synaptic tag at the stimulated synapse and induces synthesis of plasticity-related proteins (PRPs) in the soma. These PRPs must be delivered to dendritic synapses to be captured by tagged synapses, stabilizing potentiation into L-LTP.\n- A weak stimulus sets a synaptic tag but does not induce PRP synthesis; without PRP capture, only transient E-LTP occurs, which decays back to baseline within a few hours.\n- Transport of somatically synthesized PRPs to dendrites requires kinesin-dependent anterograde transport.\n\n2) Experimental manipulation:\n- The neuron is continuously bathed in a kinesin inhibitor that selectively and completely blocks anterograde transport from soma to dendrites. Therefore, even if PRPs are synthesized in the soma, they cannot reach dendritic synapses.\n\n3) Temporal sequence and consequences:\n- At $t=0$, S1 receives a weak tetanus. By STC, this sets a tag at S1 and induces E-LTP at S1. No PRP synthesis is triggered by this weak stimulus.\n- At $t=5$ minutes, S2 receives a strong tetanus. By STC, this sets a tag at S2 and induces PRP synthesis in the soma. However, due to kinesin inhibition, these PRPs cannot be transported anterogradely into the dendrites, so neither S1 nor S2 receives somatic PRPs during the tagging window.\n\n4) Outcome at S1:\n- S1 has a tag (set at $t=0$) and displays E-LTP initially, but there are no available PRPs reaching S1 to be captured because anterograde transport is blocked. Consequently, the tag at S1 cannot capture PRPs and E-LTP cannot be consolidated into L-LTP.\n- E-LTP at S1 decays back toward baseline within its typical duration (on the order of 1 to 2 hours), well before $t=8$ hours.\n\n5) Therefore, when measured 8 hours after the initial stimulation, S1 will have returned to its baseline synaptic strength after a transient potentiation, consistent with a failure to capture PRPs.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1747519"}, {"introduction": "The journey of molecular cargo from the soma to a tagged synapse is only half the story; for consolidation to occur, these components must be correctly utilized. This final practice [@problem_id:2351896] zooms into the synapse itself, probing the critical role of local machinery—specifically, dendritic ribosomes—in the final step of translating captured messenger RNAs into the proteins that enact long-term structural and functional change. It highlights the remarkable autonomy of individual dendritic compartments in memory formation.", "problem": "The Synaptic Tagging and Capture (STC) hypothesis provides a framework for understanding how synapses are selectively strengthened during learning and memory. This process underlies the consolidation of Late-Phase Long-Term Potentiation (L-LTP), a persistent, protein synthesis-dependent increase in synaptic efficacy. The hypothesis posits that a \"weak\" synaptic stimulation can create a local, transient \"synaptic tag.\" If a \"strong\" stimulation occurs elsewhere in the same neuron within a certain time window, the neuron's soma synthesizes a pool of Plasticity-Related Products (PRPs). These PRPs, which include key messenger RNAs (mRNAs), diffuse throughout the dendritic tree and are \"captured\" by any tagged synapse, enabling its conversion to L-LTP.\n\nConsider a model pyramidal neuron with two independent, spatially separate dendritic spines, Spine A and Spine B.\n- At time $t=0$, Spine A receives a weak tetanic stimulation. This stimulation is sufficient to induce a synaptic tag but is too weak to trigger the somatic synthesis of PRPs or to induce L-LTP on its own.\n- At time $t=45$ minutes, Spine B receives a strong tetanic stimulation, which is sufficient to induce L-LTP at Spine B and to initiate the transcription and translation of PRPs in the cell's soma.\n- Crucially, an experimental compound that selectively and irreversibly deactivates all ribosomal subunits has been microinjected into the dendritic shaft supporting Spine A prior to the experiment. This compound is localized and does not affect ribosomes in the soma, in the dendrite supporting Spine B, or anywhere else in the neuron. All other cellular machinery, including mRNA transport and the tagging mechanism itself, remains fully functional.\n\nBased on the principles of the Synaptic Tagging and Capture hypothesis, what is the most likely fate of the synaptic potentiation at Spine A several hours after the stimulation protocol?\n\nA. Spine A will fail to show any potentiation, as the deactivated ribosomes prevent the formation of the synaptic tag.\n\nB. Spine A will exhibit robust and stable L-LTP, as the necessary PRP-encoding mRNAs from the soma are successfully captured by the tag.\n\nC. Spine A will exhibit an initial, transient potentiation that decays back to its baseline state, failing to consolidate into L-LTP.\n\nD. Spine A will exhibit robust and stable L-LTP, as fully-formed PRP proteins synthesized in the soma will diffuse to and be utilized by the tagged synapse.\n\nE. Both Spine A and Spine B will fail to consolidate L-LTP due to a retrograde signal from the deactivated ribosomes at Spine A that inhibits global protein synthesis.", "solution": "We model the events using the Synaptic Tagging and Capture (STC) framework.\n\n1) Weak stimulation at Spine A at $t=0$ sets a synaptic tag without requiring new protein synthesis. Denote the tag at A by $T_{A}(t)$, with $T_{A}(t)>0$ for $0 \\le t \\le \\tau_{\\text{tag}}$ and $T_{A}(t)=0$ for $t>\\tau_{\\text{tag}}$. Formation of $T_{A}(t)$ does not depend on ribosomal function, so local ribosomal deactivation does not prevent tagging.\n\n2) Strong stimulation at Spine B at $t=t_{s}$ with $t_{s}=45$ minutes induces L-LTP at B and triggers somatic synthesis of plasticity-related products (PRPs). Let the somatic PRP pool be $P(t)$, which increases after $t_{s}$ and diffuses into dendrites. STC posits that tagged synapses capture PRPs, giving an effective availability at A of $C_{A}(t)=T_{A}(t)P(t)$ during the tag’s lifetime if transport is intact. The problem states that mRNA transport and tagging remain fully functional, so capture can occur in principle.\n\n3) Consolidation of L-LTP at a tagged synapse requires translation of captured PRP-encoding mRNAs or utilization of locally available protein PRPs to produce the effectors that stabilize potentiation. Denote the local translation capacity at A by $r_{A}$. The irreversible deactivation of all ribosomal subunits in the dendritic shaft supporting Spine A implies $r_{A}=0$ at and near Spine A. Therefore, even if PRP-encoding mRNAs are captured at A (so $C_{A}(t)>0$ within the time window), they cannot be translated locally into proteins needed to convert the transient potentiation into late, protein synthesis-dependent L-LTP.\n\n4) As tagging is intact, Spine A can still exhibit an early-phase potentiation (E-LTP) induced by the initial weak stimulation. Let the synaptic strength at A be $S_{A}(t)$. E-LTP is transient and decays on a timescale $\\tau_{\\text{E}}$ in the absence of the protein synthesis-dependent processes required for stabilization. With $r_{A}=0$, the condition for consolidation to L-LTP at A is not satisfied, so $S_{A}(t)$ returns to baseline for $t \\gg \\tau_{\\text{E}}$ (that is, several hours later).\n\n5) Potential alternatives are ruled out as follows:\n- The tag formation does not require protein synthesis, so the premise of option A is false.\n- Capturing PRP-encoding mRNAs without the ability to translate them locally does not yield robust L-LTP, so option B is false.\n- Although some PRPs can be proteins synthesized in the soma, the canonical STC literature and local translation requirements for spine-specific consolidation indicate that local protein synthesis at the tagged synapse is necessary; blocking ribosomes locally prevents L-LTP at that input even with intact somatic synthesis, so option D is not supported.\n- There is no mechanism given for a retrograde signal from A to suppress global protein synthesis; B and soma are unaffected, so option E is false.\n\nTherefore, the most likely fate of Spine A is an initial, transient potentiation that decays back to baseline, failing to consolidate into L-LTP.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2351896"}]}
