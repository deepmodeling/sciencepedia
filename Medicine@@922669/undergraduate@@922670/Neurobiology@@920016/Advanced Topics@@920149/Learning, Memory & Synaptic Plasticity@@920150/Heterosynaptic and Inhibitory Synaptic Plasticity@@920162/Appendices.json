This first exercise provides a hands-on opportunity to work with a simplified, yet conceptually powerful, calcium-based model of synaptic plasticity.

Two excitatory synapses, labeled $A$ and $B$, are located on the same branch and separated by distance $d$. Synapse $A$ receives presynaptic spikes, while synapse $B$ receives no presynaptic input. A postsynaptic spike occurs due to network activity that includes synapse $A$ and other inputs. Heterosynaptic plasticity refers to changes at synapse $B$ despite the absence of presynaptic input at $B$. Assume local calcium concentration at synapse $i$ is given by\n$$\nC_i = \\alpha x_i + \\beta y + \\gamma e^{-d/\\lambda} x_j,\n$$\nwhere $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ indicates a presynaptic spike at synapse $i$, $y \\in \\{0,1\\}$ indicates a postsynaptic spike, $x_j$ indicates presynaptic spikes at the neighboring synapse on the same branch (with $j \\neq i$), and $e^{-d/\\lambda}$ captures passive spread of depolarization and calcium signals along the branch with space constant $\\lambda$. The sign of plasticity is determined by two calcium thresholds: if $C_i \\ge \\theta_{\\mathrm{LTP}}$ then Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) occurs and the synaptic weight $w_i$ increases ($\\Delta w_i > 0$); if $\\theta_{\\mathrm{LTD}} \\le C_i < \\theta_{\\mathrm{LTP}}$ then Long-Term Depression (LTD) occurs and $w_i$ decreases ($\\Delta w_i  0$); if $C_i  \\theta_{\\mathrm{LTD}}$ then there is no net change ($\\Delta w_i = 0$). Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) can be recovered from such calcium-based rules when the temporal order of pre- and postsynaptic spikes sets the amplitude of $C_i$ via coincidence of glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) currents and back-propagating action potentials (bAPs), but here the sign is determined by thresholds on $C_i$.\n\nLet the parameters be $\\alpha = 0.6$, $\\beta = 0.7$, $\\gamma = 1.0$, $d/\\lambda = 1$ so that $e^{-d/\\lambda} = e^{-1} \\approx 0.37$, and thresholds $\\theta_{\\mathrm{LTP}} = 1.3$, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{LTD}} = 0.8$.

A solution can be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe objective is to determine the change in synaptic weight at synapse $B$, denoted $\\Delta w_B$. According to the provided rules, this change is dictated by the local calcium concentration at synapse $B$, $C_B$.\n\nThe general equation for calcium concentration at a synapse $i$ is:\n$$ C_i = \\alpha x_i + \\beta y + \\gamma e^{-d/\\lambda} x_j $$\nTo find the calcium concentration at synapse $B$, we set $i=B$. The neighboring synapse is $j=A$. The equation becomes:\n$$ C_B = \\alpha x_B + \\beta y + \\gamma e^{-d/\\lambda} x_A $$\nWe are given the conditions for the trial:\n*   Presynaptic activity at synapse $B$: $x_B = 0$.\n*   Postsynaptic activity: $y = 1$.\n*   Presynaptic activity at the neighboring synapse $A$: $x_A = 1$.\n\nSubstituting these binary values into the equation for $C_B$:\n$$ C_B = \\alpha (0) + \\beta (1) + \\gamma e^{-d/\\lambda} (1) $$\n$$ C_B = \\beta + \\gamma e^{-d/\\lambda} $$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values for the parameters:\n*   $\\beta = 0.7$\n*   $\\gamma = 1.0$\n*   $e^{-d/\\lambda} = e^{-1} \\approx 0.37$\n\nThe calculation for $C_B$ proceeds as follows:\n$$ C_B = 0.7 + (1.0)(0.37) $$\n$$ C_B = 0.7 + 0.37 $$\n$$ C_B = 1.07 $$\nThe next step is to compare this calcium concentration, $C_B = 1.07$, to the given plasticity thresholds:\n*   Threshold for LTP: $\\theta_{\\mathrm{LTP}} = 1.3$\n*   Threshold for LTD: $\\theta_{\\mathrm{LTD}} = 0.8$\n\nWe apply the plasticity rules:\n1.  Is $C_B \\ge \\theta_{\\mathrm{LTP}}$? Is $1.07 \\ge 1.3$? This is false. Therefore, LTP does not occur.\n2.  Is $\\theta_{\\mathrm{LTD}} \\le C_B  \\theta_{\\mathrm{LTP}}$? Is $0.8 \\le 1.07  1.3$? This is true, as $1.07$ is greater than $0.8$ and less than $1.3$. Therefore, LTD occurs.\n3.  Is $C_B  \\theta_{\\mathrm{LTD}}$? Is $1.07  0.8$? This is false.\n\nThe condition for LTD is met. The model predicts that synapse $B$ will undergo Long-Term Depression, resulting in a decrease in its synaptic weight, $\\Delta w_B  0$. This is a classic example of heterosynaptic LTD, where an inactive synapse is depressed due to activity at a neighboring synapse paired with a postsynaptic spike.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Long-Term Potentiation at $B$ (increase in $w_B$)**: This would require $C_B \\ge \\theta_{\\mathrm{LTP}} = 1.3$. Our calculation shows $C_B = 1.07$, which does not meet this condition. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **B. Long-Term Depression at $B$ (decrease in $w_B$)**: This requires $\\theta_{\\mathrm{LTD}} \\le C_B  \\theta_{\\mathrm{LTP}}$, which corresponds to $0.8 \\le C_B  1.3$. Our calculated value $C_B = 1.07$ falls within this range. **Correct**.\n\n*   **C. No net change at $B$ ($\\Delta w_B = 0$)**: This requires $C_B  \\theta_{\\mathrm{LTD}} = 0.8$. Our calculation gives $C_B = 1.07$, which is greater than this threshold. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. Indeterminate: depends only on the relative timing at $A$ and cannot be determined from the given information**: The problem provides a simplified rate-based/event-based model where the occurrence of spikes ($x_i, y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$) is sufficient to determine the outcome. The model, as specified, is not dependent on spike timing, and all necessary information is provided for a deterministic calculation.

The core definitions and well-tested facts we rely on are:\n\n- Synaptic plasticity is an activity-dependent change in synaptic efficacy, often modeled as a change in synaptic conductance $g_{\\mathrm{syn}}$ that scales the postsynaptic current $I = g_{\\mathrm{syn}}(V_m - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$, where $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ is the reversal potential.\n- Homosynaptic plasticity arises at synapses that are themselves active during induction; heterosynaptic plasticity is a change at synapses that were not activated.\n- Monosynaptic excitation is characterized by short, fixed-latency, low-jitter excitatory postsynaptic currents ($I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}}$), while polysynaptic activation produces delayed, variable-latency components and is sensitive to network excitability.\n- Feedforward and feedback inhibition mediated by $\\gamma$-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA$_\\text{A}$) receptors can alter the apparent excitatory response; isolation of excitatory currents or direct measurement of inhibitory postsynaptic currents ($I_{\\mathrm{IPSC}}$) helps disambiguate.\n- Recording rundown is a time-dependent decline in recorded current amplitude due to recording instabilities (e.g., changes in access resistance $R_s$ or cell health); proper controls include monitoring $R_s$, input resistance $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$, fiber volley amplitude $V_{\\mathrm{fv}}$ (a proxy for presynaptic axon excitability), and including a time-control input that is not subjected to induction.\n\nFrom these principles, an appropriate experimental strategy includes:\n\n1. Pathway independence verification. If $S1$ and $S2$ are independent, then the compound response from simultaneous stimulation should satisfy $I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}}^{S1+S2} \\approx I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}}^{S1} + I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}}^{S2}$ (linearity without occlusion), and failures or paired-pulse facilitation should not be correlated across pathways. This ensures that $S2$ is a distinct synaptic population whose strength can be assessed separately from $S1$.\n\n2. Induction at $S1$ only. Provide a plasticity induction protocol at $S1$ (for instance, pairing with depolarization to $V_m = 0\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ so that NMDA receptors are relieved of magnesium block) while $S2$ is only probed by low-frequency test pulses. If $I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}}^{S2}$ changes following induction, this suggests heterosynaptic plasticity.\n\n3. Excluding polysynaptic activation. Demonstrate monosynaptic characteristics: fixed-latency onset with low jitter across trials, absence of late components, and stable $V_{\\mathrm{fv}}$, which indicates stable presynaptic axon excitability. Pharmacological isolation of AMPA receptor-mediated currents and raising extracellular divalent cations can reduce recurrent network activity that would otherwise introduce polysynaptic components.\n\n4. Inhibitory confound controls. Either pharmacologically block GABA$_\\text{A}$ receptors (gabazine) to remove inhibitory circuit modulation during assessment of $I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}}$, or directly record $I_{\\mathrm{IPSC}}$ at $V_m \\approx 0\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ (near the excitatory reversal potential) to verify that any changes observed at $S2$ are not secondary to altered inhibition (e.g., disinhibition masquerading as potentiation of $I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}}$).\n\n5. Rundown controls. Continuously monitor $R_s$ and $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$; if they drift, synaptic amplitudes may change independently of plasticity. Include a time-control pathway $S3$ that receives only sparse test pulses; stability of $I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}}^{S3}$ across the experiment supports the absence of rundown.

It establishes pathway independence via the summation test $I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}}^{S1+S2} \\approx I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}}^{S1} + I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}}^{S2}$ and uncorrelated paired-pulse/failure statistics, isolates AMPA receptor-mediated $I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}}$ at $V_m = -70\\ \\mathrm{mV}$, induces plasticity only at $S1$, and leaves $S2$ unstimulated except for test pulses. It excludes polysynaptic recruitment by verifying fixed latency, lack of late components, and stable $V_{\\mathrm{fv}}$, with mention of increasing divalent cations to dampen recurrent activity. It incorporates inhibitory controls (gabazine or direct measurement of $I_{\\mathrm{IPSC}}$ at $V_m \\approx 0\\ \\mathrm{mV}$) to ensure changes are not due to altered inhibition. It also explicitly monitors $R_s$, $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$, and includes a time-control $S3$ to exclude rundown. The concluding criterion—changes in $I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}}^{S2}$ with stability of $V_{\\mathrm{fv}}$, $R_s$, $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$, and $I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}}^{S3}$—is a correct operational definition of heterosynaptic plasticity under these controls.

This option uses a single stimulating electrode driving a mixed population and does not test pathway independence, does not isolate excitatory currents, and does not monitor $V_{\\mathrm{fv}}$, $R_s$, or $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$. Changes in average $I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}}$ could reflect altered recruitment, polysynaptic activity, or recording rundown rather than heterosynaptic changes at a defined $S2$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. This option relies on extracellular field potential changes, attributes changes to $S2$ without clear separation, and interprets decreases in paired-pulse facilitation alongside increases in $V_{\\mathrm{fv}}$ as heterosynaptic plasticity. Increased $V_{\\mathrm{fv}}$ indicates altered presynaptic excitability or recruitment, which confounds interpretation; a fast rise time does not by itself exclude polysynaptic contributions. This lacks pathway independence testing, pharmacological isolation, and rundown controls. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. This option globally depolarizes the network with high extracellular potassium, which will alter excitability and synaptic release probability across many synapses, confounding any inference about $S1$-specific induction and $S2$ heterosynaptic changes. Recording both $I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}}$ and $I_{\\mathrm{IPSC}}$ at $V_m = -70\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ is not appropriate for isolating inhibitory currents; proper isolation typically uses $V_m \\approx 0\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ or pharmacology. It also lacks pathway independence and rundown controls. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5024027"}]}
