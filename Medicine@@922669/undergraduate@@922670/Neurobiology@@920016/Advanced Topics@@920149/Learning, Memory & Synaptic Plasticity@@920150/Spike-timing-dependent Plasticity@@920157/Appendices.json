Under control conditions, this synapse exhibits classic spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The standard observation is that if a presynaptic neuron's action potential repeatedly occurs just before a postsynaptic neuron's action potential (a positive time-delay), the synapse undergoes long-term potentiation (LTP). Conversely, if the postsynaptic action potential repeatedly occurs just before the presynaptic one (a negative time-delay), the synapse undergoes long-term depression (LTD).\n\nThe investigator then perfuses the culture with a solution containing AP5 (2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid), a potent and selective pharmacological antagonist that completely blocks NMDA-type glutamate receptors. After allowing the drug to take effect, the investigator repeats the STDP induction protocols.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes most accurately describes the expected effect of AP5 on the plasticity at this synapse?\n\nA. The synapse will now exhibit only LTP, regardless of the relative spike timing.\n\nB.

The depression component (LTD) of STDP will be abolished, but the potentiation component (LTP) will remain intact.", "solution": "The baseline observation is classic spike-timing-dependent plasticity at a glutamatergic synapse between hippocampal neurons. In this canonical form, pre-before-post timing produces long-term potentiation because coincident presynaptic glutamate release and postsynaptic depolarization relieve the voltage-dependent $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ block of NMDA receptors, allowing $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx through NMDA receptors. The resulting large, rapid postsynaptic $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ elevation activates kinases such as CaMKII that drive insertion and potentiation of AMPA receptors, yielding LTP. Conversely, post-before-pre timing typically produces a smaller and slower postsynaptic $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ elevation, which preferentially engages phosphatase-dependent mechanisms (for example, calcineurin and PP1) that drive AMPA receptor dephosphorylation and removal, yielding LTD. In classic hippocampal STDP at glutamatergic synapses, both the LTP and the LTD components depend critically on NMDA receptor-mediated $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry as the coincidence detector.\n\nApplication of AP5, a selective NMDA receptor antagonist, abolishes NMDA receptor activation and thus blocks NMDA receptor-mediated $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx for all relative spike timings. Without this NMDA-dependent coincidence signal, the induction pathways for both LTP (kinase-dominated, requiring large NMDA-dependent $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ transients) and LTD (phosphatase-dominated, requiring smaller NMDA-dependent $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ transients) fail. While there exist non-NMDA-dependent LTD mechanisms at some synapses (for example, those relying on metabotropic glutamate receptors or endocannabinoid signaling), the problem specifies a synapse exhibiting classic NMDA-dependent STDP. Therefore, under complete NMDA receptor blockade by AP5, both LTP and LTD components of STDP are expected to be abolished.\n\nThus, the correct outcome is that both potentiation and depression are eliminated.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2351069"}, {"introduction": "Neural communication rarely consists of single, isolated spikes; instead, neurons often fire in bursts or complex trains.
