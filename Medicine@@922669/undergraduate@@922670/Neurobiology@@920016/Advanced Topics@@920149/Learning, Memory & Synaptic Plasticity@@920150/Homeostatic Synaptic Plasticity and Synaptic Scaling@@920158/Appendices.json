The neuron receives inputs from $N$ presynaptic channels with average input rates $\\bar{x}_{i}$ and synaptic weights $w_{i}$, and its average firing rate over a slow homeostatic timescale is modeled by the linear rate equation $r=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}w_{i}\\bar{x}_{i}$. A homeostatic controller seeks to achieve a target average firing rate $r^{*}$ by multiplicatively scaling all synaptic weights by a common positive factor $\\alpha$, while preserving the ratios of synaptic strengths. Assume that over the timescale on which the controller acts, the presynaptic averages $\\bar{x}_{i}$ remain fixed, and that the neuron's transfer function is well approximated by a linear mapping in this operating regime.\n\nDerive, from these premises alone, an analytical expression for the scaling factor $\\alpha$ that achieves the target rate $r^{*}$.

The mechanism specified is a multiplicative scaling of all synaptic weights by a common positive factor, $\\alpha$. The new weights, $w'_{i}$, are therefore given by:\n$$w'_{i} = \\alpha w_{i}$$\nThe problem states that this scaling should result in the neuron's average firing rate becoming $r^{*}$. Using the same rate equation with the new weights, we have:\n$$r^{*} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w'_{i} \\bar{x}_{i}$$\nSubstituting the expression for the new weights, $w'_{i}$, into this equation:\n$$r^{*} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\\alpha w_{i}) \\bar{x}_{i}$$\nSince the scaling factor $\\alpha$ is a constant common to all terms in the summation, it can be factored out:\n$$r^{*} = \\alpha \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i} \\bar{x}_{i} \\right)$$\nThe term in the parentheses is the initial average firing rate, $r_{\\text{initial}}$. Thus, the relationship is:\n$$r^{*} = \\alpha \\cdot r_{\\text{initial}}$$\nTo find the required scaling factor $\\alpha$, we can rearrange this equation, assuming $r_{\\text{initial}} \\neq 0$:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{r^{*}}{r_{\\text{initial}}} = \\frac{r^{*}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i} \\bar{x}_{i}}$$\nThis is the general analytical expression for the scaling factor $\\alpha$.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the specific case provided.

For synaptic scaling, a classic approach involves measuring miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), which represent the quantal responses at individual synapses. This practice challenges you to predict the hallmark signature of multiplicative scaling on the statistical distribution of mEPSC amplitudes, a crucial piece of evidence that established this form of plasticity.", "problem": "A neurobiologist investigates homeostatic plasticity in cultured cortical neurons. The neurons are treated with tetrodotoxin (TTX), a neurotoxin that blocks voltage-gated sodium channels, effectively silencing network-wide electrical activity. This prolonged inactivity is known to induce a compensatory response called multiplicative synaptic scaling, which globally increases the strength of a neuron's excitatory synapses.\n\nTo quantify this change, the researcher performs whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to measure miniature Excitatory Postsynaptic Currents (mEPSCs) from a single neuron under two conditions: first before the treatment (Control), and then after 48 hours of continuous TTX exposure (Scaled). The amplitudes of thousands of mEPSCs are measured for each condition. The data is then used to generate two cumulative probability distribution plots, where the y-axis represents the cumulative probability and the x-axis represents the mEPSC amplitude in picoamperes (pA). Let the curve for the Control condition be denoted as $C_{control}$ and the curve for the Scaled condition be denoted as $C_{scaled}$.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate description of the relationship between the two curves, $C_{control}$ and $C_{scaled}$, on this plot?\n\nA. $C_{scaled}$ is shifted to the left of $C_{control}$, indicating that the median mEPSC amplitude has decreased as a result of the TTX treatment.\n\nB. $C_{scaled}$ is shifted vertically upward relative to $C_{control}$. This vertical shift signifies that all mEPSC amplitudes were increased by a constant, additive amount.\n\nC. $C_{scaled}$ is shifted to the right of $C_{control}$. For any given mEPSC amplitude value $A > 0$, the cumulative probability on $C_{scaled}$ is less than or equal to the cumulative probability on $C_{control}$.\n\nD. The median mEPSC amplitude for $C_{scaled}$ is greater than for $C_{control}$, but the curves have different shapes, causing $C_{scaled}$ to intersect $C_{control}$ at multiple points.\n\nE. $C_{scaled}$ and $C_{control}$ are identical because synaptic scaling affects the frequency of mEPSCs, but does not alter their individual amplitudes.", "solution": "Homeostatic multiplicative synaptic scaling can be modeled as a global multiplicative increase of all excitatory synaptic amplitudes by a common factor. Let $X$ be the random variable representing mEPSC amplitudes under Control with cumulative distribution function $C_{control}(a)=P(X \\leq a)$ for $a \\geq 0$. After TTX-induced multiplicative scaling, each amplitude is scaled by a constant factor $s1$, so the Scaled amplitudes are represented by $Y=sX$.\n\nUsing the standard transformation rule for cumulative distribution functions under positive scaling, we compute for any $a \\geq 0$:\n$$\nC_{scaled}(a) \\equiv P(Y \\leq a) = P(sX \\leq a) = P\\!\\left(X \\leq \\frac{a}{s}\\right) = C_{control}\\!\\left(\\frac{a}{s}\\right).\n$$\nBecause $s1$, for any $a0$ we have $\\frac{a}{s}a$. Since any cumulative distribution function is nondecreasing, it follows that\n$$\nC_{scaled}(a) = C_{control}\\!\\left(\\frac{a}{s}\\right) \\leq C_{control}(a).\n$$\nThus, at any fixed amplitude $a0$, the cumulative probability for the Scaled condition is less than or equal to that of Control, meaning the Scaled CDF is shifted to the right relative to Control. The shape is preserved because $C_{scaled}$ is obtained by a horizontal rescaling of the $x$-axis; it is not a vertical shift and does not introduce crossings except trivially at the distribution limits. The median also scales multiplicatively: if $m_{control}$ satisfies $C_{control}(m_{control})=\\frac{1}{2}$, then $C_{scaled}(sm_{control})=C_{control}(m_{control})=\\frac{1}{2}$, so $m_{scaled}=s\\,m_{control}m_{control}$.\n\nTherefore, the description that for any given amplitude $A0$ the cumulative probability on $C_{scaled}$ is less than or equal to that on $C_{control}$, corresponding to a rightward shift produced by multiplicative scaling, is correct. This matches option C, whereas options A, B, D, and E contradict the multiplicative, shape-preserving horizontal scaling of the amplitude distribution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2338668"}, {"introduction": "A fundamental challenge for the brain is to be both plastic enough to learn and stable enough to function reliably. This raises a critical question: how does a global homeostatic mechanism like synaptic scaling interact with synapse-specific learning rules like Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)? This problem delves into this interaction, demonstrating how multiplicative scaling can preserve the relative synaptic weight patterns that store information, even while adjusting the overall synaptic gain to maintain stability.", "problem": "A neuroscientist is studying a model neuron in a culture dish. In its initial, stable state, the neuron has a total of $N=2000$ excitatory synapses. All synapses are functionally identical, each having a synaptic strength of $w_{initial} = 1.0$ arbitrary units (a.u.). The neuron maintains its baseline activity level through homeostatic mechanisms that regulate its total synaptic input strength, with the initial total strength serving as the homeostatic set-point.\n\nThe scientist first performs an experiment to induce Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) at a single, specific synapse. This targeted stimulation causes the strength of this \"tagged\" synapse to increase by a fractional amount $f_{LTP} = 0.60$ (i.e., a 60% increase), while the strengths of the other $N-1$ \"naive\" synapses are unaffected.\n\nImmediately following the LTP induction, the entire culture is treated with a neurotoxin that blocks all presynaptic activity, thus chronically depriving the neuron of input. This prolonged deprivation is known to trigger a global homeostatic response. This response acts to multiplicatively scale the strength of every synapse on the neuron by a common factor. The scaling continues until the neuron's total potential synaptic input strength (the sum of all individual synaptic strengths) reaches a new target value that is $115\\%$ of the original homeostatic set-point (i.e., the total strength before LTP).\n\nCalculate the final strength of the tagged synapse after this homeostatic scaling is complete.
