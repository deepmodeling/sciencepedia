It is scientifically grounded in established principles of neurobiophysics, well-posed with all necessary information provided for a unique solution, and phrased in objective, formal language. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the membrane time constant, $\\tau_m$, from foundational principles for a single-compartment passive neuron model. The governing principle is charge conservation on the membrane. The total current, which is the sum of any externally applied current $I_{ext}$ and the internally generated ionic currents, must equal the rate of change of charge on the membrane capacitor. For this simplified model, the only ionic current is the leak current, $I_L$. The current stored by the capacitor is the capacitive current, $I_C$. The charge conservation law is thus expressed as:\n$$I_{ext}(t) = I_C(t) + I_L(t)$$\nThe capacitive current is defined by the physical properties of a capacitor: $I_C = C_m \\frac{dV_m}{dt}$, where $C_m$ is the membrane capacitance and $V_m$ is the membrane potential. The leak current is assumed to be Ohmic, following the relation $I_L = g_L(V_m - E_L)$, where $g_L$ is the leak conductance and $E_L$ is the reversal potential for the leak current.\n\nSubstituting these definitions into the charge conservation equation yields the full dynamic equation for the membrane potential:\n$$I_{ext}(t) = C_m \\frac{dV_m}{dt} + g_L(V_m - E_L)$$\nThe membrane time constant, $\\tau_m$, is defined as the characteristic time scale of voltage relaxation when external input is removed. Mathematically, this corresponds to setting $I_{ext}(t) = 0$ for time $t \\ge 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$0 = C_m \\frac{dV_m}{dt} + g_L(V_m - E_L)$$\nTo identify the time constant, we rearrange this equation into the canonical form of a first-order linear ordinary differential equation.\n$$C_m \\frac{dV_m}{dt} = -g_L(V_m - E_L)$$\nDividing both sides by the leak conductance $g_L$ gives:\n$$\\frac{C_m}{g_L} \\frac{dV_m}{dt} = -(V_m - E_L)$$\nThis equation is of the standard form $\\tau \\frac{dy}{dt} = -y$, where $y(t) = V_m(t) - E_L$ represents the deviation of the voltage from its resting equilibrium, and $\\tau$ is the time constant of the system.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe first step is to formally derive the expression for the rheobase current, $I_{\\mathrm{rheo}}$, from the given membrane equation and definition. The rheobase is defined for a constant input current $I$. The membrane equation becomes:\n$$C \\,\\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\frac{V - V_{\\mathrm{rest}}}{R_{\\mathrm{in}}} + I$$\nThe definition specifies the \"steady state\" condition. In steady state, the membrane potential $V$ no longer changes with time, so its derivative with respect to time is zero:\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dt} = 0 $$\nLet the steady-state voltage be denoted by $V_{ss}$. Substituting $\\frac{dV}{dt} = 0$ and $V = V_{ss}$ into the membrane equation gives:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{V_{ss} - V_{\\mathrm{rest}}}{R_{\\mathrm{in}}} + I $$\nThis equation relates the steady-state voltage to the constant input current $I$. We can solve for $V_{ss}$:\n$$ \\frac{V_{ss} - V_{\\mathrm{rest}}}{R_{\\mathrm{in}}} = I $$\n$$ V_{ss} = V_{\\mathrm{rest}} + I R_{\\mathrm{in}} $$\nThe rheobase, $I_{\\mathrm{rheo}}$, is defined as the smallest current $I$ for which the potential can reach the threshold $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$. In the context of the steady-state analysis, this corresponds to the current that sets the steady-state voltage exactly equal to the threshold voltage. For any current smaller than this, $V_{ss}$ would be less than $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$, and the neuron would never fire. Thus, we set $I = I_{\\mathrm{rheo}}$ and $V_{ss} = V_{\\mathrm{th}}$:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{th}} = V_{\\mathrm{rest}} + I_{\\mathrm{rheo}} R_{\\mathrm{in}} $$\nSolving for the rheobase current $I_{\\mathrm{rheo}}$:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{rheo}} R_{\\mathrm{in}} = V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_{\\mathrm{rest}} $$\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{rheo}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_{\\mathrm{rest}}}{R_{\\mathrm{in}}} $$\nThis expression is the general relationship between the rheobase and the biophysical parameters of the neuron in the LIF model. It shows that the rheobase is inversely proportional to the input resistance $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$, assuming $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{rest}}$ are constant.\n\nNow, we apply this relationship to the specific conditions of the problem. Let the initial state be denoted by subscript $1$ and the final state after the plasticity-induced change be denoted by subscript $2$.\nThe initial rheobase is:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{rheo},1} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_{\\mathrm{rest}}}{R_{\\mathrm{in},1}} $$\nThe new rheobase after the change in input resistance is:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{rheo},2} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_{\\mathrm{rest}}}{R_{\\mathrm{in},2}} $$\nThe problem states that $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{rest}}$ are unchanged. We are given $I_{\\mathrm{rheo},1} = 100$ pA and that $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$ increases by a factor of $1.2$, so $R_{\\mathrm{in},2} = 1.2 \\, R_{\\mathrm{in},1}$.\n\nTo find the new rheobase $I_{\\mathrm{rheo},2}$, we can take the ratio of the two rheobase expressions:\n$$ \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{rheo},2}}{I_{\\mathrm{rheo},1}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_{\\mathrm{rest}}}{R_{\\mathrm{in},2}} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_{\\mathrm{rest}}}{R_{\\mathrm{in},1}} \\right)} $$\nThe term $(V_{\\mathrm{th}} - V_{\\mathrm{rest}})$ cancels out:\n$$ \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{rheo},2}}{I_{\\mathrm{rheo},1}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{in},1}}{R_{\\mathrm{in},2}} $$\nNow, substitute the relationship between $R_{\\mathrm{in},1}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{in},2}$:\n$$ \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{rheo},2}}{I_{\\mathrm{rheo},1}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{in},1}}{1.2 \\, R_{\\mathrm{in},1}} = \\frac{1}{1.2} $$\nWe can now solve for $I_{\\mathrm{rheo},2}$:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{rheo},2} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{rheo},1}}{1.2} $$\nSubstituting the given value for the initial rheobase, $I_{\\mathrm{rheo},1} = 100$ pA:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{rheo},2} = \\frac{100}{1.2} \\text{ pA} $$\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{rheo},2} = \\frac{1000}{12} \\text{ pA} = \\frac{250}{3} \\text{ pA} \\approx 83.333... \\text{ pA} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{rheo},2} \\approx 83.3 \\text{ pA} $$\nThe increase in input resistance makes the neuron \"less leaky,\" meaning a smaller current is sufficient to charge the membrane to the threshold voltage.

I will dissect the problem by applying first principles of membrane biophysics and cable theory.\n\nThe governing equation for the membrane potential $V$ in the proximal dendrite is given as:\n$$\nC_m \\frac{dV}{dt} = -g_L (V - E_L) - g_A\\, m_\\infty(V)\\, h(t)\\, (V - E_K) + I_{\\text{syn}}(t) + I_{\\text{bAP}}(t)\n$$\nThe A-type current is $I_A = g_A m_\\infty(V) h(t) (V - E_K)$. We are given that $E_K \\approx -90\\ \\mathrm{mV}$. Since both bAPs and EPSPs are depolarizing events, the membrane potential $V$ will be significantly more positive than $E_K$. Therefore, the term $(V - E_K)$ is positive, and $I_A$ is an outward current (positive charge flows out of the cell). Outward currents are repolarizing or hyperpolarizing; they counteract depolarization.\n\nThe plastic change is an upregulation of the maximal A-type conductance: $g_A \\to \\alpha g_A$, where $\\alpha  1$. We will analyze the impact of this change on the two observables.\n\n**Analysis of Observable (i): Peak Local bAP Voltage**\n\nA backpropagating action potential (bAP) is a fast and large depolarization that travels from the soma into the dendrites. The current associated with it is $I_{\\text{bAP}}(t)$.\n\n1.  **Shunting Effect:** The problem states that A-type channel activation is rapid ($\\tau_m \\sim 1\\ \\mathrm{ms}$), so the fast-rising bAP will effectively activate $I_A$ (i.e., $m_\\infty(V)$ will increase rapidly as $V$ increases). The current term $-I_A = -g_A m_\\infty h (V - E_K)$ in the membrane equation acts as a negative feedback on voltage. When $g_A$ is upregulated to $\\alpha g_A$, the magnitude of this outward, repolarizing current increases for any given depolarization. This larger outward current more effectively counteracts the depolarizing current $I_{\\text{bAP}}(t)$, \"shunting\" the voltage increase. As a result, the peak voltage achieved by the bAP will be lower.\n\n2.  **Cable-Theoretic Effect:** The problem states that the electrotonic length constant, $\\lambda$, decreases with increased membrane conductance. The total membrane conductance, $g_{total}$, is the sum of all active conductances, so $g_{total} = g_L + g_A m_\\infty h + \\dots$. When the bAP activates the A-type channels, $g_A m_\\infty h$ becomes large, increasing $g_{total}$. Upregulating $g_A$ to $\\alpha g_A$ means that the peak conductance during a bAP will be even larger. A larger $g_{total}$ leads to a smaller length constant $\\lambda$. According to the qualitative cable equation $V(x) = V_0 e^{-x/\\lambda}$, a smaller $\\lambda$ results in more rapid voltage attenuation with distance $x$ from the soma. Thus, at any given proximal dendritic site, the bAP will have a smaller amplitude.\n\nBoth mechanisms lead to the same conclusion: upregulating $g_A$ **reduces** the peak local bAP amplitude.\n\n**Analysis of Observable (ii): Effective EPSP Integration Window**\n\nThis observable is the half-width of the voltage response to a high-frequency burst of $5$ EPSPs at $50\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$. The inter-stimulus interval is $T = 1 / (50\\ \\mathrm{Hz}) = 20\\ \\mathrm{ms}$. A wider integration window corresponds to greater temporal summation of EPSPs.\n\n1.  **Effect on a Single EPSP:** A single EPSP is a transient, relatively fast depolarization. This depolarization will activate $I_A$. The resulting outward K$^+$ current will speed up the repolarization phase of the EPSP, making it shorter in duration. Upregulating $g_A$ enhances this effect, making the EPSP even shorter and smaller in amplitude. This is because the activated A-type channels increase the total membrane conductance, $g_{total}$. The effective membrane time constant is $\\tau_{eff} = C_m / g_{total}$. A larger $g_A$ leads to a larger $g_{total}$ during the EPSP, which in turn leads to a smaller $\\tau_{eff}$. A smaller time constant implies a faster decay of voltage, hence a briefer EPSP.\n\n2.  **Effect on Temporal Summation:** Temporal summation depends on the duration of individual EPSPs. If each EPSP is shorter, its voltage has more time to decay before the next EPSP in the train arrives. This reduces the ability of successive EPSPs to build upon each other. With an increased $g_A$, the individual EPSPs are shorter, so temporal summation is less effective. This results in a smaller overall depolarization envelope for the burst of stimuli. The voltage response will rise to a lower peak and decay more quickly. A faster-decaying response has a smaller half-width. Therefore, upregulating $g_A$ **narrows** the effective EPSP integration window.\n\n3.  **Role of Inactivation:** The inactivation time constant is $\\tau_h \\sim 10-30\\ \\mathrm{ms}$, which is comparable to the inter-stimulus interval of $20\\ \\mathrm{ms}$. This means that the first EPSP in the train will activate $I_A$, which will then begin to inactivate. By the time the second EPSP arrives, $I_A$ will be partially inactivated, reducing its impact. While this is true, the primary consequence of upregulating $g_A$ is to amplify the current's effect whenever it *is* active. The powerful suppression of the first EPSP significantly reduces the depolarization on which subsequent EPSPs build, which is a dominant factor in reducing overall summation.\n\nThe classic function of $I_A$ is to act as a filter that preferentially suppresses inputs with a fast rate of rise ($dV/dt$), such as a typical AMPA receptor-mediated EPSP. Upregulating $g_A$ enhances this filtering property.\n\n**Summary of Predictions:**\n(i) bAP amplitude: Decreases.\n(ii) EPSP integration window: Narrows.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A) Upregulation of $g_A$ reduces local bAP amplitude and narrows the effective EPSP integration window by preferentially suppressing fast-rising EPSPs, while relatively sparing slowly rising inputs due to A-type inactivation dynamics.**\n    This option aligns perfectly with our analysis. It correctly states that bAP amplitude is reduced and the EPSP integration window is narrowed. The provided mechanism, a preferential suppression of fast-rising inputs, is the canonical function of $I_A$ and correctly explains the observed effects. The note about sparing slowly rising inputs is also correct, as slower inputs allow more time for inactivation to develop, blunting the peak $I_A$.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B) Upregulation of $g_A$ increases local bAP amplitude via enhanced repolarization and broadens the EPSP integration window by reducing effective leak conductance.**\n    This option is incorrect. Increasing an outward K$^+$ current ($I_A$) opposes depolarization and thus *reduces*, not increases, bAP amplitude. It increases total conductance, leading to a smaller time constant and a *narrower*, not broader, integration window. It does not reduce leak conductance.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) Upregulation of $g_A$ reduces local bAP amplitude but enhances temporal summation of high-frequency EPSPs because rapid inactivation of $I_A$ diminishes its impact during a $50\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$ burst.**\n    This option correctly identifies the reduction in bAP amplitude. However, it incorrectly claims that temporal summation is enhanced. As analyzed, the shortening of individual EPSPs by the stronger $I_A$ outweighs the effect of inactivation on later EPSPs, leading to a net *reduction* in summation.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) Upregulation of $g_A$ has minimal effect on proximal bAP amplitude due to its location and primarily increases EPSP amplitude by increasing membrane resistance.**\n    This option is incorrect. Dendritic $I_A$ is known to be a potent regulator of bAP amplitude. Furthermore, upregulating a conductance *decreases* effective membrane resistance ($R_{eff} = 1/g_{total}$), which would *decrease*, not increase, EPSP amplitude.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E) Upregulation of $g_A$ converts the proximal dendrite into a regenerative compartment, increasing bAP amplitude and causing supralinear EPSP summation.**\n    This option is incorrect. Regenerative events and supralinear summation are mediated by voltage-gated *inward* currents (e.g., Na$^+$, Ca$^{2+}$), not outward K$^+$ currents like $I_A$. $I_A$ has a shunting, inhibitory effect that linearizes or sub-linearizes summation and reduces excitability.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on a rigorous application of the provided principles, option A provides the most accurate and mechanistically sound description of the consequences of upregulating dendritic $I_A$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5027411"}]}
