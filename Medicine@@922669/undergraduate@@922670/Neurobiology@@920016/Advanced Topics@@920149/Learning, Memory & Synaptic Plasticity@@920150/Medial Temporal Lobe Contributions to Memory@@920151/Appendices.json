This practice introduces Signal Detection Theory (SDT), a powerful framework for separating true memory sensitivity from decision-making bias.

It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be furnished.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires an analysis using the framework of Signal Detection Theory (SDT). In a yes/no recognition task, each item elicits some level of internal \"evidence\" or \"familiarity strength\". SDT models this evidence as a random variable drawn from one of two distributions: a \"noise\" distribution for new items and a \"signal+noise\" distribution for old items. The problem specifies an equal-variance Gaussian model, which is the standard formulation.\n\nUnder this model, the evidence strength for new items is assumed to follow a standard normal distribution, $N(\\mu_N, \\sigma^2)$, which can be normalized to have a mean $\\mu_N=0$ and a standard deviation $\\sigma=1$. The evidence strength for old items is assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution with the same standard deviation, $N(\\mu_S, \\sigma^2)$, but a greater mean, $\\mu_S > \\mu_N$. The separation between the means of the two distributions, normalized by the standard deviation, defines the sensitivity or discriminability index, $d'$.\n$$d' = \\frac{\\mu_S - \\mu_N}{\\sigma}$$\nIn our normalized framework where $\\mu_N=0$ and $\\sigma=1$, this simplifies to $d' = \\mu_S$.\n\nA participant makes a \"yes\" (old) or \"no\" (new) decision by comparing the evidence for an item to a decision criterion, $\\lambda$. If the evidence exceeds $\\lambda$, the participant responds \"yes\".\n\nThe Hit Rate ($H$) is the probability of correctly identifying an old item as \"old\". This is the area under the signal+noise distribution to the right of the criterion $\\lambda$.\n$$H = P(\\text{evidence} > \\lambda | \\text{old}) = \\int_{\\lambda}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-d')^2}{2}\\right) dx = 1 - \\Phi( \\lambda - d')$$\nwhere $\\Phi(z)$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.\n\nThe False Alarm Rate ($F$) is the probability of incorrectly identifying a new item as \"old\". This is the area under the noise distribution to the right of the criterion $\\lambda$.\n$$F = P(\\text{evidence} > \\lambda | \\text{new}) = \\int_{\\lambda}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2}\\right) dx = 1 - \\Phi(\\lambda)$$\n\nTo solve for $d'$ and $\\lambda$, we invert these relationships using the inverse standard normal CDF, which we denote as $z(p) = \\Phi^{-1}(p)$.\nFrom the equation for $F$, we have $\\Phi(\\lambda) = 1 - F$. Using the symmetry property $\\Phi(x) = 1 - \\Phi(-x)$, we get $\\Phi(\\lambda) = \\Phi(-z(F))$, so the criterion location is $\\lambda = -z(F)$.\nFrom the equation for $H$, we have $\\Phi(\\lambda - d') = 1-H$, which implies $\\lambda - d' = z(1-H) = -z(H)$.\nSubstituting $\\lambda = -z(F)$ into this second equation gives:\n$$-z(F) - d' = -z(H)$$\nSolving for $d'$ yields the standard formula for sensitivity:\n$$d' = z(H) - z(F)$$\n\nThe decision criterion is often expressed as a bias measure, $c$, which specifies the location of the criterion relative to the neutral point where no response bias exists. This neutral point is located midway between the two distribution means, at $d'/2$. The bias $c$ is defined as the distance of the criterion $\\lambda$ from this point, normalized by $\\sigma=1$.\n$$c = \\lambda - \\frac{d'}{2}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\lambda$ and $d'$:\n$$c = -z(F) - \\frac{1}{2}(z(H) - z(F)) = -\\frac{1}{2}(z(H) + z(F))$$\nA value of $c=0$ indicates no bias. A value $c > 0$ indicates a conservative bias (a tendency to say \"no\"), and $c  0$ indicates a liberal bias (a tendency to say \"yes\").\n\nNow, we apply these formulae to the data from each group. We will use the property that $z(p) = -z(1-p)$.\n\n**1. Control Group Analysis**\n- Given: $H_{\\text{control}} = 0.80$, $F_{\\text{control}} = 0.20$.\n- We find the corresponding $z$-scores: $z(H_{\\text{control}}) = z(0.80)$ and $z(F_{\\text{control}}) = z(0.20)$.\n- Note that $z(0.20) = z(1 - 0.80) = -z(0.80)$.\n- The sensitivity $d'_{\\text{control}}$ is:\n$$d'_{\\text{control}} = z(0.80) - z(0.20) = z(0.80) - (-z(0.80)) = 2 \\times z(0.80)$$\n- Using a standard normal CDF table or calculator, $z(0.80) \\approx 0.84162$.\n$$d'_{\\text{control}} \\approx 2 \\times 0.84162 = 1.68324$$\n- The decision criterion $c_{\\text{control}}$ is:\n$$c_{\\text{control}} = -\\frac{1}{2}(z(0.80) + z(0.20)) = -\\frac{1}{2}(z(0.80) - z(0.80)) = 0$$\n\n**2. Perirhinal-Lesioned Patient Group Analysis**\n- Given: $H_{\\text{patient}} = 0.65$, $F_{\\text{patient}} = 0.35$.\n- We find the corresponding $z$-scores: $z(H_{\\text{patient}}) = z(0.65)$ and $z(F_{\\text{patient}}) = z(0.35)$.\n- Note that $z(0.35) = z(1 - 0.65) = -z(0.65)$.\n- The sensitivity $d'_{\\text{patient}}$ is:\n$$d'_{\\text{patient}} = z(0.65) - z(0.35) = z(0.65) - (-z(0.65)) = 2 \\times z(0.65)$$\n- Using a standard normal CDF table or calculator, $z(0.65) \\approx 0.38532$.\n$$d'_{\\text{patient}} \\approx 2 \\times 0.38532 = 0.77064$$\n- The decision criterion $c_{\\text{patient}}$ is:\n$$c_{\\text{patient}} = -\\frac{1}{2}(z(0.65) + z(0.35)) = -\\frac{1}{2}(z(0.65) - z(0.65)) = 0$$\n\n**3. Inference on the Lesion Effect**\nThe analysis yields the following parameters:\n- Control Group: $d'_{\\text{control}} \\approx 1.683$, $c_{\\text{control}} = 0$.\n- Patient Group: $d'_{\\text{patient}} \\approx 0.771$, $c_{\\text{patient}} = 0$.\n\nThe sensitivity index $d'$, which measures the ability to discriminate between old and new items, is substantially lower in the patient group ($d'_{\\text{patient}} \\approx 0.771$) compared to the control group ($d'_{\\text{control}} \\approx 1.683$). In contrast, the decision criterion $c$, which measures response bias, is identical for both groups ($c=0$).\n\nThe problem statement links the perirhinal cortex to familiarity-based recognition. In the SDT framework, familiarity is the underlying evidence signal. The sensitivity $d'$ directly reflects the separation between the evidence distributions for old and new items. A lesion that impairs the familiarity signal generated by the perirhinal cortex would cause the evidence for old items to be weaker and less distinct from the evidence for new items. This would manifest as a decrease in the separation between the signal and noise distributions, i.e., a reduction in $d'$. The data clearly show this pattern.\n\nThe decision criterion $c$ reflects a subject's response strategy, influenced by factors such as payoffs and perceived probabilities. Since these were held constant and are typically governed by prefrontal cognitive control systems rather than the medial temporal lobe, it is expected that the lesion would not affect decision bias. The finding that $c$ is unchanged supports this.\n\nTherefore, the effect of the perirhinal cortex lesion is unequivocally characterized as a deficit in memory sensitivity, not a change in decision bias.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Change in Sensitivity**\nThe final step is to calculate the change in sensitivity, $\\Delta d'$.\n$$\\Delta d' = d'_{\\text{control}} - d'_{\\text{patient}}$$\n$$\\Delta d' \\approx 1.68324 - 0.77064 = 0.91260$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\Delta d' \\approx 0.9126$$\nThe value is dimensionless, as $d'$ itself is a standardized measure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9126}$$", "id": "5031501"}, {"introduction": "While some models treat memory as varying along a single dimension of strength, many researchers believe recognition is supported by at least two distinct processes: a detail-rich 'recollection' and a more general 'familiarity'.

The validation of the problem statement confirms that it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We can therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nLet $R$ represent the probability that a studied item is successfully recollected. Recollection is defined as the retrieval of specific contextual details about the learning episode, which in this task includes knowing that the item belonged to the target list.\nLet $F$ represent the probability that a studied item is recognized on the basis of a feeling of familiarity, in the absence of recollection.\nThe problem states three core assumptions for the model:\n$1$. Recollection and familiarity are separable processes.\n$2$. Familiarity-based judgments occur only when recollection fails.\n$3$. The probabilities $R$ and $F$ are independent.\n\nWe are given the aggregate probabilities of responding \"old\" to a target-list item under two different instructional contexts:\n-   Inclusion context: $P(\\text{\"old\"}) = I = 0.71$\n-   Exclusion context: $P(\\text{\"old\"}) = E = 0.27$\n\nWe will now derive expressions for $I$ and $E$ in terms of $R$ and $F$ based on the task rules and model assumptions.\n\n**Inclusion Condition**\nIn the inclusion task, participants are instructed to respond \"old\" to any item they recognize as having been studied. An \"old\" response to a target item can be generated through two mutually exclusive pathways, based on the assumption that familiarity is only assessed if recollection fails:\n$1$. The participant successfully recollects the item. The probability of this event is $R$. A successful recollection leads directly to an \"old\" response.\n$2$. The participant fails to recollect the item, but the item generates a feeling of familiarity. The probability of failing to recollect is $(1 - R)$. Given that recollection has failed, the probability that the item feels familiar is $F$. Due to the independence of these processes, the joint probability of this pathway is $(1 - R) \\times F$.\n\nThe total probability of responding \"old\" in the inclusion condition, $I$, is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive pathways:\n$$I = R + (1-R)F$$\n\n**Exclusion Condition**\nIn the exclusion task, participants are instructed to respond \"old\" only to items from a *non-target* list. For items from the target list, the correct response is \"new\". Therefore, an \"old\" response to a target item in this condition constitutes an error. This error occurs if and only if the participant fails to recollect that the item was on the target list (which would have led them to correctly respond \"new\") AND the item feels familiar, compelling an incorrect \"old\" response.\n-   The probability of failing to recollect the item's source is $(1 - R)$.\n-   The probability that the item feels familiar is $F$.\n\nAgain, due to the independence assumption, the probability of this joint event is the product of the individual probabilities. Thus, the probability of incorrectly responding \"old\" in the exclusion condition, $E$, is:\n$$E = (1-R)F$$\n\n**Solving for $R$ and $F$**\nWe now have a system of two algebraic equations with two unknowns, $R$ and $F$:\n$1$. $I = R + (1-R)F$\n$2$. $E = (1-R)F$\n\nWe can solve this system to find expressions for $R$ and $F$ in terms of the observable quantities $I$ and $E$.\nSubstitute the expression for $(1-R)F$ from equation ($2$) directly into equation ($1$):\n$$I = R + E$$\nThis provides a simple expression for the probability of recollection:\n$$R = I - E$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for familiarity, $F$.
