The fraction of methylated sites at time $t$, denoted $M(t)$, is regulated by the opposing enzymatic actions of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and Ten-eleven translocation (TET) demethylase. Assume a well-mixed locus and mass-action kinetics under constant enzyme availability, so that methylation proceeds at a rate proportional to the unmethylated fraction and demethylation proceeds at a rate proportional to the methylated fraction.

The validation of the problem statement confirms that it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The model, while a simplification of complex biological reality, is a standard and valid approach in theoretical biology for studying dynamic epigenetic states.\n\nThe dynamics of the methylation fraction, $M(t)$, are described by the first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = k_m\\left(1 - M\\right) - k_d M\n$$\nHere, $M$ represents the fraction of methylated sites, so it is a dimensionless quantity constrained to the interval $[0, 1]$. Consequently, the fraction of unmethylated sites is $(1 - M)$. The term $k_m(1 - M)$ represents the rate of methylation, which is proportional to the concentration of available unmethylated sites. The constant $k_m$ is the effective rate constant for methylation, encompassing the activity of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes. The term $-k_d M$ represents the rate of demethylation, which is proportional to the concentration of methylated sites available as substrate. The constant $k_d$ is the effective rate constant for demethylation, reflecting the activity of enzymes such as the Ten-eleven translocation (TET) family. The rate constants $k_m$ and $k_d$ are inherently non-negative, i.e., $k_m \\ge 0$ and $k_d \\ge 0$.\n\nA steady state is a condition where the state variable of the system, in this case $M(t)$, no longer changes with time. Mathematically, this is defined by the condition that the time derivative of the state variable is zero.\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = 0\n$$\nWe denote the value of $M$ at steady state as $M^{*}$. By substituting this condition into the governing differential equation, we transition from a dynamic equation to an algebraic equation that defines the equilibrium point(s) of the system.\n$$\n0 = k_m\\left(1 - M^{*}\\right) - k_d M^{*}\n$$\nOur goal is to solve this algebraic equation for $M^{*}$. First, we distribute the $k_m$ term on the right-hand side:\n$$\n0 = k_m - k_m M^{*} - k_d M^{*}\n$$\nNext, we collect all terms containing $M^{*}$ on one side of the equation. We can move the terms with $M^{*}$ to the left-hand side:\n$$\nk_m M^{*} + k_d M^{*} = k_m\n$$\nNow, we factor out the common term $M^{*}$ from the expression on the left-hand side:\n$$\nM^{*}\\left(k_m + k_d\\right) = k_m\n$$\nFinally, to isolate $M^{*}$, we divide both sides by the sum of the rate constants, $(k_m + k_d)$. This is permissible as long as $k_m + k_d \\neq 0$. Given that $k_m$ and $k_d$ are non-negative rate constants, their sum can only be zero if both are zero, which would represent a trivial system with no dynamic activity. In any biologically relevant scenario, at least one of the rates is non-zero, so $k_m + k_d > 0$.\n$$\nM^{*} = \\frac{k_m}{k_m + k_d}\n$$\nThis expression gives the steady-state methylation fraction as a function of the methylation and demethylation rate constants. It represents the point of balance where the rate of methylation equals the rate of demethylation. For instance, if $k_m \\gg k_d$, $M^{*}$ approaches $1$, indicating a state of high methylation. Conversely, if $k_d \\gg k_m$, $M^{*}$ approaches $0$, indicating a state of low methylation. If the rates are equal, $k_m = k_d$, then $M^{*} = \\frac{k_m}{k_m + k_m} = \\frac{k_m}{2k_m} = \\frac{1}{2}$, indicating that half the sites are methylated at steady state.

The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Part 1: ODE Derivation and Steady-State Analysis**\n\nThe rate of change of the acetylated fraction, $\\frac{dA}{dt}$, is the difference between the rate of acetylation and the rate of deacetylation.\n\nThe rate of acetylation is given as a first-order process acting on the unacetylated fraction, $(1 - A(t))$. The rate is therefore $k_{ac}(1 - A(t))$.\nThe rate of deacetylation is given as a first-order process acting on the acetylated fraction, $A(t)$. The rate is therefore $k_{deac}A(t)$.\n\nCombining these terms gives the ordinary differential equation for $A(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = k_{ac}(1 - A) - k_{deac}A $$\n\nAt steady state, the system does not change in time, so $\\frac{dA}{dt} = 0$. Let $A^{*}$ denote the steady-state fraction. The equation becomes:\n$$ 0 = k_{ac}(1 - A^{*}) - k_{deac}A^{*} $$\nWe solve for $A^{*}$:\n$$ k_{ac} - k_{ac}A^{*} = k_{deac}A^{*} $$\n$$ k_{ac} = A^{*}(k_{ac} + k_{deac}) $$\n$$ A^{*} = \\frac{k_{ac}}{k_{ac} + k_{deac}} $$\nThis is the general expression for the steady-state acetylation level.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Steady-State Acetylation Levels**\n\nFirst, we calculate the baseline steady-state level, $A^{*}_{\\text{baseline}}$, using the given baseline rate constants: $k_{ac} = 0.06\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$ and $k_{deac} = 0.04\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$.\n$$ A^{*}_{\\text{baseline}} = \\frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.04} = \\frac{0.06}{0.10} = 0.6 $$\nSo, the baseline steady-state acetylation level is $60\\,\\%$.\n\nNext, we consider the HDAC2 overexpression condition. The acetylation rate constant $k_{ac}$ is unchanged. The deacetylation rate constant is multiplied by a factor $\\gamma = 3$. Let the new deacetylation rate constant be $k'_{deac}$.\n$$ k'_{deac} = \\gamma\\,k_{deac} = 3 \\times 0.04\\,\\text{min}^{-1} = 0.12\\,\\text{min}^{-1} $$\nThe new steady-state acetylation level, $A^{*}_{\\text{HDAC2}}$, is calculated using the new rate constant:\n$$ A^{*}_{\\text{HDAC2}} = \\frac{k_{ac}}{k_{ac} + k'_{deac}} = \\frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.12} = \\frac{0.06}{0.18} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nSo, the steady-state acetylation level under HDAC2 overexpression is approximately $33.3\\,\\%$.\n\n**Part 3: Fold-Change in Transcription**\n\nThe steady-state transcriptional output, $T$, is modeled as a Hill function of the steady-state acetylation level, $A^{*}$:\n$$ T(A^{*}) = T_{\\max}\\,\\frac{(A^{*})^{n}}{(A^{*})^{n} + K^{n}} $$\nThe given parameters are a Hill coefficient $n = 2$ and a half-activation constant $K = 0.5$.\nThe expression for transcriptional output is:\n$$ T(A^{*}) = T_{\\max}\\,\\frac{(A^{*})^{2}}{(A^{*})^{2} + (0.5)^{2}} $$\n\nWe now calculate the transcriptional output for both the baseline and HDAC2-overexpressing conditions.\nFor the baseline condition, we use $A^{*}_{\\text{baseline}} = 0.6$:\n$$ T_{\\text{baseline}} = T_{\\max}\\,\\frac{(0.6)^{2}}{(0.6)^{2} + (0.5)^{2}} = T_{\\max}\\,\\frac{0.36}{0.36 + 0.25} = T_{\\max}\\,\\frac{0.36}{0.61} $$\n\nFor the HDAC2 overexpression condition, we use $A^{*}_{\\text{HDAC2}} = \\frac{1}{3}$:\n$$ T_{\\text{HDAC2}} = T_{\\max}\\,\\frac{(\\frac{1}{3})^{2}}{(\\frac{1}{3})^{2} + (0.5)^{2}} = T_{\\max}\\,\\frac{\\frac{1}{9}}{\\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{4}} $$\nTo simplify the denominator:\n$$ \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{4}{36} + \\frac{9}{36} = \\frac{13}{36} $$\n$$ T_{\\text{HDAC2}} = T_{\\max}\\,\\frac{\\frac{1}{9}}{\\frac{13}{36}} = T_{\\max}\\,\\left(\\frac{1}{9} \\times \\frac{36}{13}\\right) = T_{\\max}\\,\\frac{4}{13} $$\n\nThe desired fold-change is the ratio $\\frac{T_{\\text{HDAC2}}}{T_{\\text{baseline}}}$.
