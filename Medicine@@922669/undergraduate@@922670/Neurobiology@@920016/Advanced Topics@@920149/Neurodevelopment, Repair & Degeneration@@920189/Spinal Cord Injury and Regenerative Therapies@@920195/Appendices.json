For a cation like Ca$^{2+}$, a negative driving force ($V_m < E_{\\mathrm{ion}}$) results in an inward current.

The reduction in driving force constitutes a negative feedback mechanism: the accumulation of the permeant ion itself reduces the force for its further entry. Consequently, the rate of Ca$^{2+}$ influx into the neuron slows down as cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ builds up.\n\nMitochondria serve as critical high-capacity buffers for cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$, taking up the ion via the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). The MCU is activated by the very micromolar concentrations of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ described in the problem. The primary driver for mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake is the large negative mitochondrial membrane potential ($\\Delta\\Psi_m \\approx -150\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to $-180\\,\\mathrm{mV}$).\n\nThe calculated reduction in the plasma membrane driving force does not directly alter the intrinsic properties of the mitochondrion or the MCU. Instead, it impacts the demand placed on the mitochondrial buffering system. By slowing the rate of Ca$^{2+}$ entry into the cytosol, this feedback mechanism reduces the total calcium load that mitochondria must sequester per unit time. This easing of the Ca$^{2+}$ burden is crucial. It allows the mitochondrial buffering system to operate more sustainably, delaying its saturation and the onset of mitochondrial dysfunction. If the influx were unabated, mitochondria could become rapidly overloaded, leading to the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), collapse of $\\Delta\\Psi_m$, release of sequestered Ca$^{2+}$, and initiation of apoptotic cell death pathways. Therefore, the decrease in the inward Ca$^{2+}$ driving force across the plasma membrane helps to preserve mitochondrial buffering capacity by reducing the rate at which this capacity is consumed during an excitotoxic insult.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{30.76}$$", "id": "5064162"}, {"introduction": "For recovery to occur, severed axons must regrow through a complex and often hostile landscape.

Assume that the effective time to bring the next node of Ranvier to threshold is proportional to the $\\tau_{m}$ of the intervening myelinated internode, and that the average conduction velocity scales as the internode distance traversed per such charging time.\n\nConsider an intact axon with internode length $L_{0}$ and internodal membrane properties $r_{m,0}$ and $c_{m,0}$. After demyelination and subsequent remyelination, the new myelin sheath is thinner and the regenerated internodes are shorter. Empirically, assume the following changes due to remyelination: the specific membrane resistance of the internode decreases by a factor $\\beta$ (so $r_{m,1} = r_{m,0} / \\beta$), the specific membrane capacitance increases by a factor $\\gamma$ (so $c_{m,1} = \\gamma c_{m,0}$), and the internode length shortens from $L_{0}$ to $L_{1}$. Neglect changes in axonal diameter, axial resistivity, and channel kinetics at nodes of Ranvier.\n\nStarting from the definitions above and standard scaling arguments from cable theory for saltatory conduction, derive an expression for the fold-change in conduction velocity $v_{1}/v_{0}$ in terms of $L_{0}$, $L_{1}$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$. Then, using $L_{0} = 1.5$ mm, $L_{1} = 1.0$ mm, $\\beta = 2$, and $\\gamma = 3$, compute the numerical value of $v_{1}/v_{0}$. Express your final answer as a simplified fraction. No rounding is required, and the answer should be dimensionless (no units).", "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation prior to attempting a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Definition of membrane time constant: $\\tau_{m} = r_{m} c_{m}$, where $r_{m}$ is the specific membrane resistance and $c_{m}$ is the specific membrane capacitance.\n- The effective time to bring the next node of Ranvier to threshold, let's denote it $T$, is proportional to the internodal $\\tau_{m}$: $T \\propto \\tau_{m}$.\n- The average conduction velocity, $v$, scales as the internode distance, $L$, traversed per such charging time: $v \\propto L/T$.\n- Initial (intact) state, denoted by subscript $0$: internode length $L_{0}$, specific membrane resistance $r_{m,0}$, and specific membrane capacitance $c_{m,0}$.\n- Final (remyelinated) state, denoted by subscript $1$: internode length $L_{1}$, specific membrane resistance $r_{m,1}$, and specific membrane capacitance $c_{m,1}$.\n- Relationships between states: $r_{m,1} = r_{m,0} / \\beta$, $c_{m,1} = \\gamma c_{m,0}$, and internode length changes from $L_{0}$ to $L_{1}$.\n- Neglected factors: changes in axonal diameter, axial resistivity, and channel kinetics at nodes of Ranvier.\n- Numerical values for calculation: $L_{0} = 1.5$ mm, $L_{1} = 1.0$ mm, $\\beta = 2$, $\\gamma = 3$.\n- Required output: an expression for the fold-change in conduction velocity $v_{1}/v_{0}$ and its numerical value as a simplified fraction.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of neurophysiology and cable theory. The definition of the membrane time constant is standard. The scaling assumptions for conduction velocity in saltatory conduction ($v \\propto L/T$ and $T \\propto \\tau_m$) are reasonable simplifications used in biophysical modeling. The described changes following remyelination (thinner sheaths leading to decreased $r_m$ and increased $c_m$, and shorter internodes) are consistent with experimental observations. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and relationships to derive a unique solution for the requested ratio. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid and a solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe problem provides the scaling relationships for the average conduction velocity, $v$. We are given:\n$1$. The conduction velocity $v$ is proportional to the internode length $L$ divided by the charging time $T$:\n$$v \\propto \\frac{L}{T}$$\n$2$. The charging time $T$ is proportional to the membrane time constant $\\tau_{m}$:\n$$T \\propto \\tau_{m}$$\nCombining these two proportionalities, we find the relationship between conduction velocity and the membrane time constant:\n$$v \\propto \\frac{L}{\\tau_{m}}$$\nThe membrane time constant is defined as $\\tau_{m} = r_{m} c_{m}$. Substituting this definition into the proportionality for velocity gives:\n$$v \\propto \\frac{L}{r_{m} c_{m}}$$\nThis proportionality can be expressed as an equation with a constant of proportionality, $k$:\n$$v = k \\frac{L}{r_{m} c_{m}}$$\nThe constant $k$ encapsulates all other factors affecting velocity, such as axial resistance and nodal properties, which are assumed to be unchanged in this problem.\n\nWe can write expressions for the velocity in the initial (intact) state, $v_{0}$, and the final (remyelinated) state, $v_{1}$:\n$$v_{0} = k \\frac{L_{0}}{r_{m,0} c_{m,0}}$$\n$$v_{1} = k \\frac{L_{1}}{r_{m,1} c_{m,1}}$$\nTo find the fold-change in conduction velocity, we compute the ratio $v_{1} / v_{0}$:\n$$\\frac{v_{1}}{v_{0}} = \\frac{k \\frac{L_{1}}{r_{m,1} c_{m,1}}}{k \\frac{L_{0}}{r_{m,0} c_{m,0}}}$$\nThe constant of proportionality $k$ cancels out:\n$$\\frac{v_{1}}{v_{0}} = \\frac{L_{1}}{L_{0}} \\cdot \\frac{r_{m,0} c_{m,0}}{r_{m,1} c_{m,1}}$$\nNow, we substitute the given relationships for the remyelinated axon's properties: $r_{m,1} = r_{m,0} / \\beta$ and $c_{m,1} = \\gamma c_{m,0}$.\n$$\\frac{v_{1}}{v_{0}} = \\frac{L_{1}}{L_{0}} \\cdot \\frac{r_{m,0} c_{m,0}}{\\left(\\frac{r_{m,0}}{\\beta}\\right) (\\gamma c_{m,0})}$$\nThe terms $r_{m,0}$ and $c_{m,0}$ cancel from the numerator and denominator:\n$$\\frac{v_{1}}{v_{0}} = \\frac{L_{1}}{L_{0}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta}}$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the general formula for the fold-change in velocity:\n$$\\frac{v_{1}}{v_{0}} = \\frac{L_{1}}{L_{0}} \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the fold-change in conduction velocity in terms of $L_{0}$, $L_{1}$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$.\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values to compute the result: $L_{0} = 1.5$, $L_{1} = 1.0$, $\\beta = 2$, and $\\gamma = 3$.\n$$\\frac{v_{1}}{v_{0}} = \\frac{1.0}{1.5} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}$$\nWe can write the fraction $1.0 / 1.5$ as $10 / 15$, which simplifies to $2 / 3$.\n$$\\frac{v_{1}}{v_{0}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}$$\n$$\\frac{v_{1}}{v_{0}} = \\frac{4}{9}$$\nThe numerical value of the fold-change in conduction velocity is $\\frac{4}{9}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$$", "id": "5064052"}]}
