The concepts are scientifically sound and fundamental to the study of cell proliferation.\n\nThere is a critical ambiguity in the problem statement that must be resolved. The BrdU labeling index is first defined theoretically as $LI(t)$, the fraction of *cycling* progenitors. However, the problem then provides experimental data for a \"labeling index\" curve whose plateau value is $P=0.420$. If this were the $LI(t)$ as defined (fraction of cycling cells), its plateau must be $1$, since eventually all cycling cells will enter the S-phase and incorporate BrdU. A plateau of $0.420$ is inconsistent with this definition.\n\nThe standard resolution is to assume that the experimental data ($m$, $b$, $P$) refer to an *experimentally measured* labeling index, which is the fraction of the *total* progenitor population (both cycling and quiescent) that becomes labeled. Let us denote this experimental index as $LI_{exp}(t)$. This index is related to the theoretical index $LI(t)$ (fraction of cycling cells) and the growth fraction $GF$ by the relation $LI_{exp}(t) = GF \\cdot LI(t)$. Under this interpretation, the plateau of the experimental curve, $P$, corresponds to the growth fraction $GF$, as $LI(t)$ plateaus at $1$. This interpretation renders the problem consistent and solvable. It is a standard assumption in the analysis of such data.\n\nWith this clarified interpretation, the problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The provided data are dimensionally and physically consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is deemed valid, subject to the explicit clarification of the definition of the measured labeling index.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Solution\n\n**Assumptions for the Model:**\n1.  **Asynchronous Population:** The cycling progenitor cells are uniformly distributed throughout the cell cycle. This implies the fraction of cells in any given phase is proportional to the duration of that phase relative to the total cycle time.\n2.  **Stable Population:** The population of progenitors is in a steady state, with the growth fraction $GF$ and total cell number remaining constant over the experimental duration.\n3.  **Constant Cycle Parameters:** All cycling cells share the same constant total cycle time $T_{C}$ and S-phase duration $T_{S}$.\n4.  **Ideal Labeling:** BrdU becomes available to all cells instantly at $t=0$ and is incorporated without delay by any cell entering S-phase. The label does not perturb the cell cycle.\n5.  **Interpretation of Measured LI:** As determined above, the experimental labeling index data ($m$, $b$, $P$) correspond to the fraction of the *total* progenitor population, not just the cycling subpopulation. The plateau $P$ therefore represents the growth fraction $GF$.\n\n**Derivation of the Labeling Index of Cycling Cells:**\nLet $LI_{cyc}(t)$ be the fraction of *cycling* cells that are labeled at time $t$. Based on the assumption of a uniform distribution, the fraction of cycling cells that are in S-phase at any given moment is the ratio of the S-phase duration to the total cycle duration. At $t=0$, when BrdU infusion begins, these cells are instantly labeled.\n$$ LI_{cyc}(0) = \\frac{T_{S}}{T_{C}} $$\nFor $t > 0$, cells that were in the G1 phase (preceding S-phase) will progressively enter S-phase and become labeled. Assuming a uniform distribution, the rate of entry into S-phase is constant. In a time interval $t$, a fraction of the population equal to $t/T_{C}$ will have entered S-phase. These are cells that were at most a time $t$ away from the start of S-phase at $t=0$.\nThus, for the initial period, the total labeled fraction of cycling cells is the sum of those initially in S-phase and those that have entered it:\n$$ LI_{cyc}(t) = \\frac{T_{S}}{T_{C}} + \\frac{t}{T_{C}} $$\nThis linear increase continues until all cycling cells have had the opportunity to pass through S-phase. The last cells to enter S-phase are those that were just exiting S-phase at $t=0$. The time required for these cells to traverse the G2, M, and G1 phases and re-enter S-phase is $T_{C} - T_{S}$. At this time point, $t = T_{C} - T_{S}$, the labeling index becomes:\n$$ LI_{cyc}(T_{C} - T_{S}) = \\frac{T_{S}}{T_{C}} + \\frac{T_{C} - T_{S}}{T_{C}} = \\frac{T_{S} + T_{C} - T_{S}}{T_{C}} = 1 $$\nFor all times $t \\geq T_{C} - T_{S}$, all cycling cells will have incorporated the label, so $LI_{cyc}(t)$ reaches a plateau of $1$.\nThe complete expression for the fraction of labeled cycling cells is:\n$ LI_{cyc}(t) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{T_S + t}{T_C} & \\text{for } 0 \\leq t \\leq T_C - T_S \\\\ 1 & \\text{for } t > T_C - T_S \\end{cases} $\n\n**Relating to Experimental Observables:**\nThe experimentally measured labeling index, $LI(t)$, represents the fraction of the *total* progenitor population labeled. This is given by $LI(t) = GF \\cdot LI_{cyc}(t)$.\n$ LI(t) = \\begin{cases} GF \\left( \\frac{T_S}{T_C} + \\frac{t}{T_C} \\right) & \\text{for } 0 \\leq t \\leq T_C - T_S \\\\ GF & \\text{for } t > T_C - T_S \\end{cases} $\nThis model predicts that a plot of $LI(t)$ versus $t$ will show an initial linear increase followed by a plateau.\nThe plateau value is $P = GF$.\nThe initial linear portion has the form $y(t) = mt + b$. By comparing with the equation for $LI(t)$, we can identify:\n- The slope: $m = \\frac{GF}{T_{C}}$.\n- The $y$-intercept at $t=0$: $b = LI(0) = GF \\frac{T_{S}}{T_{C}}$.\n\nFrom these relationships, we can express $T_{S}$ and $T_{C}$ in terms of the measurable parameters $m$, $b$, and $P$:\nSubstitute $P=GF$ into the slope equation:\n$$ m = \\frac{P}{T_{C}} \\implies T_{C} = \\frac{P}{m} $$\nTo find $T_S$, we can take the ratio of the intercept $b$ to the slope $m$:\n$$ \\frac{b}{m} = \\frac{GF \\cdot T_{S} / T_{C}}{GF / T_{C}} = T_{S} $$\n$$ T_{S} = \\frac{b}{m} $$\nThe growth fraction is directly given by the plateau: $GF = P$.\n\n**Numerical Calculation:**\nThe given experimental values are:\n- $m = 2.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n- $b = 0.120$\n- $P = 0.420$\n\nUsing the derived formulas, we can compute $T_{S}$ and $T_{C}$:\n$$ T_{S} = \\frac{b}{m} = \\frac{0.120}{2.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.120}{0.02}\\,\\mathrm{h} = 6.00\\,\\mathrm{h} $$\n$$ T_{C} = \\frac{P}{m} = \\frac{0.420}{2.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.420}{0.02}\\,\\mathrm{h} = 21.0\\,\\mathrm{h} $$\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures.\n$$ T_{S} = 6.000\\,\\mathrm{h} $$\n$$ T_{C} = 21.00\\,\\mathrm{h} $$\nA self-consistency check is to ensure that the duration of the linear fit, $t \\leq 12\\,\\mathrm{h}$, is less than the calculated duration of the non-S phases, $T_{C} - T_{S}$.\n$$ T_{C} - T_{S} = 21.00\\,\\mathrm{h} - 6.000\\,\\mathrm{h} = 15.00\\,\\mathrm{h} $$\nSince $12\\,\\mathrm{h}  15.00\\,\\mathrm{h}$, the use of the linear portion of the curve to determine the slope and intercept is consistent with the model.\nThe growth fraction for this progenitor population is estimated to be $GF = P = 0.420$, meaning $42.0\\%$ of the cells are actively cycling.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 6.000  21.00 \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "4995432"}, {"introduction": "After their birth in the subventricular zone, new neurons destined for the olfactory bulb undertake a long and guided journey along the Rostral Migratory Stream.

Qualitative analysis of the effect of opening chloride channels on the membrane potential relative to a typical resting potential.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Equilibrium Potential for Chloride ($E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$)**\n\nThe equilibrium potential for an ion is the membrane potential at which there is no net flow of that ion across the membrane. This occurs when the electrical force on the ion exactly balances the chemical force due to its concentration gradient. At equilibrium, the electrochemical potential of the ion is equal across the membrane.\n\nThe electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}_j$, for an ionic species $j$ is given by:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_j = \\mu_j + z_j F \\phi\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_j$ is the chemical potential, $z_j$ is the valence (charge) of the ion, $F$ is the Faraday constant ($F \\approx 96485\\ \\mathrm{C} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$), and $\\phi$ is the electrical potential.\n\nThe chemical potential, assuming an ideal solution (activity coefficient of $1$), is given by:\n$$\n\\mu_j = \\mu_j^0 + RT \\ln([j])\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_j^0$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the ideal gas constant ($R \\approx 8.314\\ \\mathrm{J} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$), $T$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin, and $[j]$ is the molar concentration of the ion.\n\nFor the chloride ion, $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$, the valence is $z_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = -1$.

Therefore, when GABA$_{\\mathrm{A}}$ channels open, the membrane potential will move from $-70\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ towards $-39.2\\ \\mathrm{mV}$. A change in membrane potential to a less negative value is, by definition, a **depolarization**.\n\nThis conclusion can be justified by examining the driving force on the chloride ions.

Since $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$ is a negative ion, a negative current signifies an efflux (outward flow) of $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$ from the neuron.
