In neurons under basal conditions, the steady-state degradation of such proteins can be modeled using first-order kinetics when the protein concentration is low relative to the Michaelis constant. Specifically, for a pathway that obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics with maximum rate $V_{\\max}$ and Michaelis constant $K_{m}$, the instantaneous rate $v$ at substrate concentration $[P]$ is given by $v = \\dfrac{V_{\\max}[P]}{K_{m} + [P]}$, and when $[P] \\ll K_{m}$, this reduces to the effective first-order form $v \\approx \\left(\\dfrac{V_{\\max}}{K_{m}}\\right)[P]$, so that the pathway contributes an effective first-order rate constant $k = \\dfrac{V_{\\max}}{K_{m}}$.
