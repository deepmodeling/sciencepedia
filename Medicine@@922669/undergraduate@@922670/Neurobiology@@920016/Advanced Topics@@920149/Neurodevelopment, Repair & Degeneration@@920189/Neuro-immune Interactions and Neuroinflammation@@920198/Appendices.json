The TEER values provided are within a realistic range for such experiments.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

It is a valid and formalizable problem in biophysics and neurobiology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem consists of two parts: a numerical calculation and a biophysical interpretation.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Fractional Change in TEER**\n\nThe problem defines the fractional change as the change in the value divided by the baseline value. Let $R_{baseline}$ be the initial TEER and $R_{final}$ be the final TEER after treatment with IL-1$\\beta$.\n\nThe fractional change, which we denote as $\\Delta R_{frac}$, is calculated as:\n$$\n\\Delta R_{frac} = \\frac{R_{final} - R_{baseline}}{R_{baseline}}\n$$\n\nThe given values are:\n- $R_{baseline} = 2000\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$\n- $R_{final} = 1200\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$\n\\Delta R_{frac} = \\frac{1200 - 2000}{2000}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta R_{frac} = \\frac{-800}{2000}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta R_{frac} = -\\frac{8}{20} = -\\frac{2}{5}\n$$\n\nAs a signed decimal fraction, this is:\n$$\n\\Delta R_{frac} = -0.4\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Biophysical and Neurobiological Interpretation**\n\nThe calculated fractional change of $-0.4$ indicates a $40\\%$ decrease in Transendothelial Electrical Resistance ($TEER$). We must now interpret this result based on first principles.\n\n1.  **TEER and Ionic Permeability**: $TEER$ ($R_{TEER}$) is a measure of the electrical resistance across a cellular monolayer. According to Ohm's Law, resistance ($R$) is defined as the ratio of voltage ($V$) to current ($I$), i.e., $R = V/I$. In the context of the BBB, the electrical current is carried by the flow of ions (e.g., $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$) across the endothelial cell layer. While some transport occurs through the cells (transcellular pathway), the primary determinant of $TEER$ in a tight monolayer is the paracellular pathway—the space between adjacent cells. Therefore, resistance is inversely proportional to the ionic conductance ($G$) or permeability ($P$) of this paracellular route:\n    $$\n    R_{TEER} \\propto \\frac{1}{I_{ion}} \\propto \\frac{1}{G_{ion}} \\propto \\frac{1}{P_{ion}}\n    $$\n    A high $TEER$ implies low ionic permeability, and a low $TEER$ implies high ionic permeability.\n\n2.  **Paracellular Permeability and Tight Junctions**: The paracellular pathway is sealed by complex protein structures called tight junctions. These junctions form a physical barrier that selectively restricts the passage of ions and molecules between cells. The integrity of these tight junctions is the principal determinant of the BBB's barrier function and, consequently, its $TEER$.\n\n3.  **Interpretation of the Result**: The computed negative change in $TEER$ signifies a decrease in the barrier's electrical resistance. Based on the inverse relationship established above, a decrease in $R_{TEER}$ corresponds to a direct increase in the paracellular ionic permeability ($P_{ion}$).\n    $$\n    \\text{Decrease in } R_{TEER} \\implies \\text{Increase in } I_{ion} \\implies \\text{Increase in } P_{ion}\n    $$\n    This increased permeability indicates a failure of the barrier to restrict ionic flow.\n\n4.  **Neurobiological Context**: The agent causing this change is IL-1$\\beta$, a key pro-inflammatory cytokine. The result demonstrates that IL-1$\\beta$ compromises the integrity of the BBB model. The substantial magnitude of the change (a $40\\%$ drop) highlights the potent effect of this cytokine. From a mechanistic standpoint, this is consistent with the known effects of neuroinflammation. IL-1$\\beta$ binds to receptors on the brain endothelial cells and initiates intracellular signaling cascades. These cascades can lead to the phosphorylation, delocalization, and/or downregulation of critical tight junction proteins such as claudins, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). The structural disorganization of these proteins 'loosens' the junctions, increasing the permeability of the paracellular space.\n\nIn summary, the calculated decrease in $TEER$ provides quantitative evidence that IL-1$\\beta$ induces a significant breakdown of BBB integrity by disrupting tight junctions, leading to a 'leakier' barrier.

This measure should represent the percent difference relative to the wild-type condition, derived from the concept of normalized change.\n\nLet the synapse density in the experimental condition (C3$^{-/-}$) be denoted by $S_{exp}$ and the synapse density in the reference or control condition (WT) be denoted by $S_{ref}$.\n$$ S_{exp} = S_{C3^{-/-}} = 1.2 \\text{ synapses } \\mu\\text{m}^{-3} $$\n$$ S_{ref} = S_{WT} = 0.9 \\text{ synapses } \\mu\\text{m}^{-3} $$\n\nFirst, we determine the absolute change, $\\Delta S$, in synapse density. This is the difference between the experimental value and the reference value.\n$$ \\Delta S = S_{exp} - S_{ref} $$\n\nTo create a unitless measure that reflects the change relative to the baseline, we compute the normalized change. This is accomplished by dividing the absolute change by the reference value. Let's call this measure the relative difference, $D_{rel}$.\n$$ D_{rel} = \\frac{\\Delta S}{S_{ref}} = \\frac{S_{exp} - S_{ref}}{S_{ref}} $$\nThis formula provides the fractional change in the measured quantity in the experimental group compared to the control group. A positive value indicates an increase relative to the control, while a negative value indicates a decrease. This is precisely the \"percent difference relative to the wild-type condition\" expressed as a decimal, as requested.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into the derived formula:\n$$ D_{rel} = \\frac{S_{C3^{-/-}} - S_{WT}}{S_{WT}} = \\frac{1.2 - 0.9}{0.9} $$\n\nPerforming the subtraction in the numerator:\n$$ D_{rel} = \\frac{0.3}{0.9} $$\n\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$ D_{rel} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ D_{rel} = 0.33333... $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$ D_{rel} \\approx 0.333 $$\n\n### Biological Interpretation\n\nThe calculated value for the relative difference, $D_{rel}$, is approximately $+0.333$.\n\n-   **Sign:** The positive sign indicates that the synapse density is higher in the C3 knockout mice than in the wild-type mice.\n-   **Magnitude:** The magnitude of $0.333$ signifies that the synapse density in C3$^{-/-}$ mice is $33.3\\%$ greater than in their wild-type counterparts.\n\nThe biological context provided states that C3 is central to tagging synapses for microglial recognition and subsequent elimination (pruning). Synaptic pruning is a critical process for refining neural circuits during development. A higher synapse density in the C3 knockout mice after the developmental pruning period strongly suggests that this process has failed. Without C3 to \"tag\" synapses, microglia, which express the C3 receptor (CR3), are unable to efficiently identify and engulf superfluous synapses. This leads to an impairment in synaptic pruning, resulting in the retention of an excess number of synapses compared to the normal developmental trajectory observed in wild-type animals. Therefore, the positive sign and substantial magnitude of the calculated measure confirm that microglial synaptic pruning is indeed impaired in the C3 knockout relative to the wild-type condition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.333}$$", "id": "5039971"}, {"introduction": "Neuroinflammation can also disrupt the moment-to-moment function of synapses by altering neurotransmitter homeostasis.
