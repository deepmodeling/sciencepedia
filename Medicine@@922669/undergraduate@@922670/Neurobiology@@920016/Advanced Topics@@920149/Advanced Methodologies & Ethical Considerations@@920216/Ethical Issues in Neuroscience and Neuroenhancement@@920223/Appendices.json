The utility of this certain outcome is:\n$$\nU(\\text{status quo}) = U(1) = \\frac{1^{1-\\rho}}{1-\\rho} = \\frac{1}{1-\\rho}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the expected utility of choosing the neuroenhancement intervention.

The derivative is $f'(p) = U(1-b) - U(1+b) = \\frac{(1-b)^{1-\\rho} - (1+b)^{1-\\rho}}{1-\\rho}$. The utility function $U(x)$ is strictly increasing since $U'(x) = x^{-\\rho}>0$ for $x>0$.

In this operationalization, this means maximizing $W_L$. The maximum value is $W_L^C = 409.48$. Therefore, Policy C is the policy that best satisfies the Rawlsian difference principle.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n- **A. Policy A (ban):** This policy yields an expected $308.5$ admissions for group $L$. This is the lowest value among all four policies. Therefore, it does not satisfy the Rawlsian difference principle. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **B. Policy B (unrestricted access):** This policy yields an expected $342.16$ admissions for group $L$. While this is an improvement over the ban, it is significantly lower than the values from policies C and D. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **C. Policy C (restricted-to-least-advantaged with subsidy):** This policy yields an expected $409.48$ admissions for group $L$. This is the highest value among all four policies. Thus, it maximizes the position of the least advantaged group as defined in the problem. **Correct**.\n\n- **D. Policy D (progressive access rule):** This policy yields an expected $375.82$ admissions for group $L$. This value is higher than those from policies A and B, but lower than that from policy C. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "5016430"}]}
