In a simplified, nondimensionalized, well-mixed model of the pituitary-adrenal portion of this axis, let the pituitary Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) concentration be $A(t)$ and the adrenal cortisol concentration be $C(t)$. Assume the following widely used biophysical principles as your fundamental base: (i) secretion and clearance obey mass balance, (ii) hormone clearance is first-order with respect to its concentration, (iii) CRH stimulates ACTH secretion, (iv) ACTH stimulates cortisol secretion, and (v) cortisol exerts negative feedback on ACTH secretion. Let the CRH drive from PVN be a constant input $R \\ge 0$ (dimensionless), representing sustained hypothalamic activation by limbic structures during stress.

The validation of the problem statement confirms that it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. We can therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we formulate the coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the concentration of Adrenocorticotropic Hormone, $A(t)$, and cortisol, $C(t)$. The rate of change of a substance in a well-mixed compartment is governed by the principle of mass balance, which states that the net rate of change is the sum of all production (secretion) rates minus the sum of all removal (clearance) rates.\n\nFor the ACTH concentration, $A(t)$, the rate of change $\\frac{dA}{dt}$ is the difference between its secretion rate and its clearance rate.\nThe secretion of ACTH is stimulated by CRH (represented by the constant input $R$) and inhibited by cortisol ($C$). The given functional form for this rate is $s_{A} \\frac{R}{1+\\beta C}$.\nThe clearance of ACTH is a first-order process, given by the rate $k_{A} A$.\nCombining these terms, the differential equation for $A(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = \\frac{s_{A} R}{1 + \\beta C} - k_{A} A\n$$\n\nSimilarly, for the cortisol concentration, $C(t)$, the rate of change $\\frac{dC}{dt}$ is the difference between its secretion rate and its clearance rate.\nThe secretion of cortisol is stimulated by ACTH ($A$). The given functional form for this rate is $s_{C} A$.\nThe clearance of cortisol is a first-order process, given by the rate $k_{C} C$.\nCombining these terms, the differential equation for $C(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = s_{C} A - k_{C} C\n$$\nThese two coupled equations model the dynamics of the system.\n\nNext, we are asked to find the steady-state concentrations. The steady state is defined by the condition where the concentrations no longer change over time. Mathematically, this corresponds to setting the time derivatives to zero. Let $A^{\\ast}$ and $C^{\\ast}$ be the steady-state concentrations of ACTH and cortisol, respectively.\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{dC}{dt} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the steady-state concentrations into the ODEs, we obtain a system of two algebraic equations:\n$$\n\\text{(1)} \\quad \\frac{s_{A} R}{1 + \\beta C^{\\ast}} - k_{A} A^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\text{(2)} \\quad s_{C} A^{\\ast} - k_{C} C^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\nWe need to solve this system for $C^{\\ast}$.

We must select the physically meaningful branch, which requires the concentration $C^{\\ast}$ to be non-negative ($C^{\\ast} \\ge 0$).\nLet's analyze the term $\\sqrt{(k_{A} k_{C})^2 + 4 k_{A} k_{C} \\beta s_{A} s_{C} R}$. Since $4 k_{A} k_{C} \\beta s_{A} s_{C} R \\ge 0$, we have:\n$$\n\\sqrt{(k_{A} k_{C})^2 + 4 k_{A} k_{C} \\beta s_{A} s_{C} R} \\ge \\sqrt{(k_{A} k_{C})^2} = |k_{A} k_{C}| = k_{A} k_{C}\n$$\nThe equality holds only if $R=0$.\n\nThe solution with the minus sign in the numerator is:\n$$\nC^{\\ast}_{-} = \\frac{-k_{A} k_{C} - \\sqrt{(k_{A} k_{C})^2 + \\cdots}}{2 k_{A} k_{C} \\beta}\n$$\nThe numerator is a negative number minus a positive number, which is always negative. The denominator is positive.

It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective problem in mathematical neurobiology. A full solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe problem describes a trial-by-trial learning process governed by a prediction error rule. Let $V_t$ be the associative strength just before trial $t$. The predicted value of the US on trial $t$ is $V_t$. Let $R_t$ be the actual magnitude of the US delivered on trial $t$. The prediction error on trial $t$ is therefore $R_t - V_t$.\n\nThe change in associative strength, $\\Delta V_t = V_{t+1} - V_t$, is proportional to this prediction error. The constant of proportionality is given as the product of the CS salience $\\alpha$ and the US learning rate $\\beta$. Thus, the learning rule can be written as:\n$$V_{t+1} - V_t = (\\alpha \\beta) (R_t - V_t)$$\nThis can be rearranged to express $V_{t+1}$ in terms of $V_t$:\n$$V_{t+1} = V_t + \\alpha \\beta R_t - \\alpha \\beta V_t$$\n$$V_{t+1} = (1 - \\alpha \\beta) V_t + \\alpha \\beta R_t$$\nThis is a recursive formula for the associative strength. The term $R_t$ is a random variable representing the US magnitude on trial $t$. According to the problem statement, the US occurs with probability $p$ and has magnitude $\\lambda$, and does not occur with probability $1-p$ and has magnitude $0$. The probability distribution of $R_t$ is:\n$$\nR_t = \n\\begin{cases} \n\\lambda  \\text{with probability } p \\\\\n0  \\text{with probability } 1-p \n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe trials are independent, so the distribution of $R_t$ is identical for all trials $t$. The expected value of $R_t$ is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[R_t] = \\lambda \\cdot p + 0 \\cdot (1-p) = \\lambda p$$\nLet's denote the constant learning rate $\\eta = \\alpha \\beta$. The recursive equation for $V_t$ is $V_{t+1} = (1-\\eta)V_t + \\eta R_t$.\n\nThe final expression for the conductance $g_E(N)$ depends on the expected value of the associative strength after $N$ trials, $\\mathbb{E}[V_N]$. We can derive a recurrence relation for $\\mathbb{E}[V_t]$ by taking the expectation of the equation for $V_{t+1}$. Using the linearity of expectation:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[V_{t+1}] = \\mathbb{E}[(1 - \\eta) V_t + \\eta R_t]$$\n$$\\mathbb{E}[V_{t+1}] = (1 - \\eta) \\mathbb{E}[V_t] + \\eta \\mathbb{E}[R_t]$$\nSince $\\mathbb{E}[R_t] = \\lambda p$ for all $t$, we have the linear first-order non-homogeneous recurrence relation for the expected values:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[V_{t+1}] = (1 - \\eta) \\mathbb{E}[V_t] + \\eta \\lambda p$$\nThe initial condition is that the associative strength before the first trial (trial $0$) is $V_0$, which is a given constant, so $\\mathbb{E}[V_0] = V_0$.\n\nTo solve this recurrence relation, we find the fixed point, or asymptotic value, $\\mathbb{E}[V_\\infty]$, by setting $\\mathbb{E}[V_{t+1}] = \\mathbb{E}[V_t] = \\mathbb{E}[V_\\infty]$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[V_\\infty] = (1 - \\eta) \\mathbb{E}[V_\\infty] + \\eta \\lambda p$$\n$$\\eta \\mathbb{E}[V_\\infty] = \\eta \\lambda p$$\n$$\\mathbb{E}[V_\\infty] = \\lambda p$$\nNow, consider the deviation of $\\mathbb{E}[V_t]$ from this fixed point: $D_t = \\mathbb{E}[V_t] - \\mathbb{E}[V_\\infty] = \\mathbb{E}[V_t] - \\lambda p$.\nThen $\\mathbb{E}[V_t] = D_t + \\lambda p$.

The mean decision time $\\langle T \\rangle$ is therefore $T(0)$:\n$$\n\\langle T \\rangle = T(0) = -\\frac{C_1 \\sigma^2}{2v} \\exp(0) - \\frac{0}{v} + C_2 = -\\frac{C_1 \\sigma^2}{2v} + C_2\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n$$\n\\langle T \\rangle = -\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2v} \\left(\\frac{2a}{\\sigma^2 \\sinh\\left(\\frac{2va}{\\sigma^2}\\right)}\\right) + \\frac{a}{v} \\coth\\left(\\frac{2va}{\\sigma^2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\langle T \\rangle = -\\frac{a}{v \\sinh\\left(\\frac{2va}{\\sigma^2}\\right)} + \\frac{a}{v} \\frac{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{2va}{\\sigma^2}\\right)}{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{2va}{\\sigma^2}\\right)} = \\frac{a}{v} \\frac{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{2va}{\\sigma^2}\\right) - 1}{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{2va}{\\sigma^2}\\right)}\n$$\nUsing the hyperbolic identities $\\cosh(2z) - 1 = 2\\sinh^2(z)$ and $\\sinh(2z) = 2\\sinh(z)\\cosh(z)$ with $z = \\frac{va}{\\sigma^2}$:\n$$\n\\langle T \\rangle = \\frac{a}{v} \\frac{2\\sinh^2\\left(\\frac{va}{\\sigma^2}\\right)}{2\\sinh\\left(\\frac{va}{\\sigma^2}\\right)\\cosh\\left(\\frac{va}{\\sigma^2}\\right)} = \\frac{a}{v} \\frac{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{va}{\\sigma^2}\\right)}{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{va}{\\sigma^2}\\right)} = \\frac{a}{v} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{va}{\\sigma^2}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the desired analytical expression for the mean decision time. Note that if $v  0$, letting $v = -|v|$, the expression becomes $\\frac{a}{-|v|} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{-|v|a}{\\sigma^2}\\right) = \\frac{a}{-|v|} \\left(-\\tanh\\left(\\frac{|v|a}{\\sigma^2}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{a}{|v|} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{|v|a}{\\sigma^2}\\right)$. Thus, the formula is more generally expressed as $\\langle T \\rangle = \\frac{a}{|v|} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{|v|a}{\\sigma^2}\\right)$.\n\nNext, we calculate the drift rates $v_1$ and $v_2$ for the two conditions.\nGiven parameters: $\\beta = 5.0$, $a = 1.5$, $\\sigma = 1.2$, and $\\Delta = 0.5$. Thus, $\\sigma^2 = (1.2)^2 = 1.44$.\n\nCondition 1 (before fear generalization):\n$Q_{\\text{approach,1}} = 1.1$ and $Q_{\\text{avoid,1}} = 0.5$.\nThe drift rate $v_1$ is:\n$$\nv_1 = \\beta (Q_{\\text{approach,1}} - Q_{\\text{avoid,1}}) = 5.0 \\times (1.1 - 0.5) = 5.0 \\times 0.6 = 3.0\n$$\n\nCondition 2 (after fear generalization):\n$Q_{\\text{approach,2}} = Q_{\\text{approach,1}} - \\Delta = 1.1 - 0.5 = 0.6$.\n$Q_{\\text{avoid,2}} = Q_{\\text{avoid,1}} + \\Delta = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0$.\nThe drift rate $v_2$ is:\n$$\nv_2 = \\beta (Q_{\\text{approach,2}} - Q_{\\text{avoid,2}}) = 5.0 \\times (0.6 - 1.0) = 5.0 \\times (-0.4) = -2.0\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the mean decision times $\\langle T_1 \\rangle$ and $\\langle T_2 \\rangle$.\nFor condition 1, with $|v_1| = 3.0$:\n$$\n\\langle T_1 \\rangle = \\frac{a}{|v_1|} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{|v_1|a}{\\sigma^2}\\right) = \\frac{1.5}{3.0} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{3.0 \\times 1.5}{1.44}\\right) = 0.5 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{4.5}{1.44}\\right) = 0.5 \\tanh(3.125)\n$$\nFor condition 2, with $|v_2| = 2.0$:\n$$\n\\langle T_2 \\rangle = \\frac{a}{|v_2|} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{|v_2|a}{\\sigma^2}\\right) = \\frac{1.5}{2.0} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{2.0 \\times 1.5}{1.44}\\right) = 0.75 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{3.0}{1.44}\\right) = 0.75 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{25}{12}\\right)\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $\\frac{\\langle T_2 \\rangle}{\\langle T_1 \\rangle}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\langle T_2 \\rangle}{\\langle T_1 \\rangle} = \\frac{0.75 \\tanh(25/12)}{0.5 \\tanh(3.125)} = 1.5 \\frac{\\tanh(25/12)}{\\tanh(3.125)}\n$$\nNow we evaluate the numerical values:\nThe argument for $\\tanh$ in $\\langle T_2 \\rangle$ is $\\frac{25}{12} \\approx 2.08333...$\nThe argument for $\\tanh$ in $\\langle T_1 \\rangle$ is $3.125$.\n$$\n\\tanh(25/12) \\approx 0.96946752\n$$\n$$\n\\tanh(3.125) \\approx 0.99614988\n$$\nThe ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\langle T_2 \\rangle}{\\langle T_1 \\rangle} \\approx 1.5 \\times \\frac{0.96946752}{0.99614988} \\approx 1.5 \\times 0.97321503 \\approx 1.45982255\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio is $1.460$.\nThe fear generalization process reduces the magnitude of the net value signal, which decreases the absolute drift rate ($|v|$ falls from $3.0$ to $2.0$). A lower drift rate means the evidence accumulates more slowly, leading to a longer mean time to reach a decision bound. The calculated ratio, being greater than $1$, confirms this expected outcome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.460}$$", "id": "5073030"}]}
