It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions, missing information, or violations of fundamental principles. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Calculation\nThe starting point for deriving the temporal-difference (TD) error is the Bellman consistency condition for the state-value function, $V(s_t)$:\n$$V(s_t) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[r_t + \\gamma V(s_{t+1}) \\mid s_t\\right]$$\nThis equation asserts that the value of the current state, $s_t$, is the expectation of the sum of the immediate reward, $r_t$, and the discounted value of the subsequent state, $s_{t+1}$. The expectation $\\mathbb{E}[\\cdot]$ is taken over the possible rewards and next states, given the current state $s_t$.\n\nIn a real-world scenario or a simulation, an agent experiences a single trajectory, not an expectation over all possible trajectories. For a specific transition at time $t$, the agent moves from state $s_t$ to $s_{t+1}$ and receives a reward $r_t$. From this single sample, we can construct an improved, or updated, estimate of $V(s_t)$. This estimate is the \"TD target\", and it is formed by taking the quantity inside the expectation from the Bellman equation for this specific instance:\n$$ \\text{TD Target} = r_t + \\gamma V(s_{t+1}) $$\nThe term $V(s_{t+1})$ is the current estimate of the value of the next state. The TD target combines the actually received reward $r_t$ with this existing estimate, providing a more informed valuation of $s_t$ than the old value $V(s_t)$.\n\nThe temporal-difference error, $\\delta_t$, is defined as the difference between this new, sample-based estimate (the TD target) and the old estimate, $V(s_t)$.\n$$ \\delta_t = (\\text{TD Target}) - V(s_t) $$\nSubstituting the expression for the TD target, we arrive at the standard formula for the sample temporal-difference error:\n$$ \\delta_t = \\left( r_t + \\gamma V(s_{t+1}) \\right) - V(s_t) $$\nThis expression represents the error in the prediction $V(s_t)$ when compared to the outcome realized one time-step later.\n\nThe problem provides the following values for a single trial:\n- Reward: $r_t = 0$\n- Discount factor: $\\gamma = 0.9$\n- Value of current state: $V(s_t) = 0.5$\n- Value of next state: $V(s_{t+1}) = 0.6$\n\nWe substitute these numerical values into the derived expression for $\\delta_t$:\n$$ \\delta_t = (0 + 0.9 \\times 0.6) - 0.5 $$\nFirst, we compute the product inside the parentheses:\n$$ 0.9 \\times 0.6 = 0.54 $$\nNow, we substitute this result back into the equation for $\\delta_t$:\n$$ \\delta_t = 0.54 - 0.5 $$\n$$ \\delta_t = 0.04 $$\nThe numerical value of the temporal-difference error for this transition is $0.04$.\n\nFinally, we address the link to dopaminergic signaling. The reward prediction error hypothesis posits that phasic changes in dopamine neuron firing encode $\\delta_t$.\n- A positive prediction error ($\\delta_t > 0$) signifies that the outcome was better than expected. This is associated with a phasic increase (a burst) of dopamine neuron firing.\n- A negative prediction error ($\\delta_t  0$) signifies that the outcome was worse than expected. This is associated with a phasic decrease (a pause) in dopamine neuron firing below the baseline tonic rate.\n- A zero prediction error ($\\delta_t = 0$) signifies that the outcome was exactly as expected, resulting in no change to the tonic firing rate.\n\nIn this case, $\\delta_t = 0.04$, which is a positive value. This indicates a positive reward prediction error. Despite the immediate reward being zero ($r_t=0$), the agent transitioned to a state of higher value ($V(s_{t+1}) = 0.6$) than was fully anticipated by its initial state value ($V(s_t) = 0.5$). The discounted value of the next state, $0.9 \\times 0.6 = 0.54$, is greater than the initial value of $0.5$. The outcome was \"better than expected\". Therefore, this event should trigger a phasic increase in dopamine release in the striatum.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.04}\n$$", "id": "5001000"}, {"introduction": "Having calculated the RPE at a single moment, we now explore how these signals evolve over time to track complex events. Real-world environments contain cues that predict not just rewards, but also the absence of expected rewards.

It is based on the standard temporal-difference (TD) learning model, a cornerstone of computational neuroscience for explaining dopaminergic neuron activity. All necessary constants, state values, and the-governing equation are provided. The scenario of conditioned inhibition is a classic paradigm in learning theory. The assumptions about state values ($V(s_C) = \\hat{V}0$, $V(s_{C+I})=0$) are consistent with a system that has reached a stable learned state. The problem is self-contained and allows for a unique solution to be derived from the given premises. The phrasing regarding state transitions (\"$s_{C+I} \\to s_T$\", \"$s_T \\to s_{\\text{post}}$\") is slightly awkward but does not create a fundamental contradiction, as the values of all relevant states can be determined from the problem's explicit conditions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution requires the application of the temporal-difference (TD) reward prediction error (RPE) formula at three distinct time points. The formula is given as:\n$$ \\delta_t = r_t + \\gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t) $$\nHere, $\\delta_t$ is the RPE at time $t$, $r_t$ is the instantaneous reward at time $t$, $V(s_t)$ is the value of the state at time $t$, $V(s_{t+1})$ is the value of the state at the subsequent time step $t+1$, and $\\gamma$ is the discount factor, with $0  \\gamma  1$.\n\nWe will analyze each of the three specified time points.\n\n**1. RPE at the onset of the inhibitor cue $I$**\n\nThis event corresponds to a state transition from $s_C$ (the excitor cue $C$ is present) to $s_{C+I}$ (the compound cue $C+I$ is present). Let us denote the time of this onset as $t_{\\text{onset}}$.\n\n-   The state at time $t = t_{\\text{onset}}$ is the state just before the transition, which is $s_C$. Its value is given as $V(s_t) = V(s_C) = \\hat{V}$.\n-   The state at the next time step, $t+1$, is $s_{C+I}$. Its value is given as $V(s_{t+1}) = V(s_{C+I}) = 0$.\n-   The problem states that there is no instantaneous reward at cue onsets, so $r_t = r_{t_{\\text{onset}}} = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the RPE formula:\n$$ \\delta_{t_{\\text onset}} = r_{t_{\\text onset}} + \\gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t) $$\n$$ \\delta_{t_{\\text onset}} = 0 + \\gamma V(s_{C+I}) - V(s_C) $$\n$$ \\delta_{t_{\\text onset}} = \\gamma(0) - \\hat{V} = -\\hat{V} $$\n\nSince it is given that $\\hat{V}  0$, the RPE is negative. This corresponds to a numerical sign of $-1$.\n\n**2. RPE at the expected reward time $t=T$**\n\nAt time $t=T$, the agent is in the state corresponding to the presence of the compound cue, $s_{C+I}$, and is anticipating the outcome. The RPE is calculated at this moment.\n\n-   The state at time $t=T$ is $s_T = s_{C+I}$. The value of this state, which represents the agent's prediction, is $V(s_t) = V(s_{C+I}) = 0$.\n-   The reward delivered at time $t=T$ is given as $r_t = r_T = 0$, due to the omission.\n-   The state at the next time step, $t+1 = T+1$, is the state immediately following the outcome. The problem states that \"the values of subsequent states return to baseline $0$\". Let's call this state $s_{post}$. Therefore, $V(s_{t+1}) = V(s_{post}) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the RPE formula for $t=T$:\n$$ \\delta_T = r_T + \\gamma V(s_{T+1}) - V(s_T) $$\n$$ \\delta_T = 0 + \\gamma(0) - 0 $$\n$$ \\delta_T = 0 $$\n\nThe RPE is zero. This outcome is expected, as the agent correctly predicted the omission of the reward ($V(s_{C+I})=0$), and the outcome ($r_T=0$) matched the prediction. There is no \"surprise\". This corresponds to a numerical sign of $0$.\n\n**3. RPE immediately after confirmation of actual omission**\n\nThis refers to the time step immediately following the outcome, i.e., at time $t = T+1$.\n\n-   The state at time $t = T+1$ is the post-omission state, $s_{post}$, which we have established has a value of $0$. So, $V(s_t) = V(s_{post}) = 0$.\n-   At this time step, the reward event is over. There is no further reward, so $r_t = r_{T+1} = 0$.\n-   The state at the next time step, $t+1 = T+2$, is the return to the neutral baseline state, $s_{\\text{baseline}}$. The value of this state is given as $V(s_{t+1}) = V(s_{\\text{baseline}}) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the RPE formula for $t=T+1$:\n$$ \\delta_{T+1} = r_{T+1} + \\gamma V(s_{T+2}) - V(s_{T+1}) $$\n$$ \\delta_{T+1} = 0 + \\gamma V(s_{\\text{baseline}}) - V(s_{post}) $$\n$$ \\delta_{T+1} = 0 + \\gamma(0) - 0 $$\n$$ \\delta_{T+1} = 0 $$\n\nThe RPE is again zero. The transition from a neutral post-event state to a neutral baseline state, with no intervening reward, generates no prediction error. This corresponds to a numerical sign of $0$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe signs of the RPE at the three specified time points are negative, zero, and zero, respectively.
