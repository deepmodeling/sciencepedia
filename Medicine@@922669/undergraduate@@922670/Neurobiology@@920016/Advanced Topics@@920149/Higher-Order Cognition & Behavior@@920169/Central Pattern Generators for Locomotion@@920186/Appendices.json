This exercise delves into one of the core biophysical mechanisms for such intrinsic oscillation: the slow interplay between voltage-gated calcium entry and calcium-activated potassium currents. By modeling the intracellular calcium concentration $c$ as a slow variable that drives the neuron between active and silent states, you can derive the bursting behavior from first principles. This practice [@problem_id:2556980] provides a concrete, hands-on understanding of how key cellular parameters, such as the calcium clearance time constant $\\tau_{Ca}$, directly govern the timing of a neural oscillator, setting its period and duty cycle.", "problem": "Consider a single pacemaker neuron in a central pattern generator for locomotion in which bursts arise from the interaction of a voltage-dependent calcium current ($I_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$) and a calcium-activated potassium current ($I_{\\mathrm{KCa}}$) under a standard fast-slow decomposition. Assume the following widely used coarse-grained description for intracellular free calcium concentration $c$ as the slow variable. During the active (spiking) phase, the average calcium influx through $I_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$ drives $c$ toward an upper quasi-steady level $c_{\\mathrm{hi}}$, while during the silent (non-spiking) phase, pumps and exchangers drive $c$ toward a lower quasi-steady level $c_{\\mathrm{lo}}$. Under first-order buffering and clearance, the slow dynamics are\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dt} =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{c_{\\mathrm{hi}} - c}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}} & \\text{(active phase)}, \\\\\n\\dfrac{c_{\\mathrm{lo}} - c}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}} & \\text{(silent phase)}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$ is the effective calcium time constant. The calcium-activated potassium current $I_{\\mathrm{KCa}}$ monotonically increases with $c$ and terminates the active phase when $c$ crosses an upper threshold $c_{\\mathrm{off}}$, while silence ends and spiking resumes when $c$ decays below a lower threshold $c_{\\mathrm{on}}$. Assume constant thresholds satisfying $c_{\\mathrm{lo}} < c_{\\mathrm{on}} < c_{\\mathrm{off}} < c_{\\mathrm{hi}}$, and that each burst cycle begins at $c = c_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and ends the active phase at $c = c_{\\mathrm{off}}$, then ends the silent phase when $c$ returns to $c = c_{\\mathrm{on}}$. You may assume time-scale separation so that the fast voltage dynamics switch instantaneously at the thresholds, and the slow evolution of $c$ is well described by the first-order linear ordinary differential equations above.\n\nTask: Derive from first principles the expressions for the active-phase duration $T_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and silent-phase duration $T_{\\mathrm{off}}$ in terms of $\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$, $c_{\\mathrm{hi}}$, $c_{\\mathrm{lo}}$, $c_{\\mathrm{on}}$, and $c_{\\mathrm{off}}$. Then, using those expressions, write a program that computes the burst period $T = T_{\\mathrm{on}} + T_{\\mathrm{off}}$ (expressed in milliseconds) and the duty cycle $D = T_{\\mathrm{on}} / T$ (dimensionless decimal fraction) for a baseline $\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$ and for a buffered condition in which $\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$ is reduced by half.

Given the biophysical constraint $c < c_{\\mathrm{hi}}$ during the charging phase, the absolute value is unnecessary, so $|c_{\\mathrm{hi}} - c| = c_{\\mathrm{hi}} - c$. Rearranging for $c(t)$, we obtain the general solution:\n$$\n\\ln(c_{\\mathrm{hi}} - c) = -\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}} - K\n$$\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{hi}} - c = e^{-K} e^{-t/\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}}\n$$\n$$\nc(t) = c_{\\mathrm{hi}} - A e^{-t/\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}}\n$$\nwhere $A = e^{-K}$ is a new constant determined by the initial condition.

The general solution is therefore:\n$$\nc(t) = c_{\\mathrm{lo}} - B e^{-t/\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}}\n$$\nwhere $B$ is a constant. The silent phase begins at time $t=0$ (we reset the clock for this phase) when the calcium concentration is at the upper threshold, $c(0) = c_{\\mathrm{off}}$. Substituting this initial condition:\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{off}} = c_{\\mathrm{lo}} - B e^{0} \\implies B = c_{\\mathrm{lo}} - c_{\\mathrm{off}}\n$$\nThe specific solution for the silent phase is:\n$$\nc(t) = c_{\\mathrm{lo}} - (c_{\\mathrm{lo}} - c_{\\mathrm{off}}) e^{-t/\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}} = c_{\\mathrm{lo}} + (c_{\\mathrm{off}} - c_{\\mathrm{lo}}) e^{-t/\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}}\n$$\nThe silent phase terminates when the concentration decays back to the lower threshold, $c(T_{\\mathrm{off}}) = c_{\\mathrm{on}}$.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires analyzing the behavior of a dynamical system under two conditions (control and perturbed) and interpreting the results in a biomechanical context.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Control Condition**\n\nThe dynamics of the phase difference $\\phi$ are governed by:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = (K_I + K_E) \\sin(\\phi)\n$$\nIn the control condition, we are given $K_I > 0$, $K_E < 0$, and $\\lvert K_I \\rvert > \\lvert K_E \\rvert$. Since $K_I$ is positive, the last condition is equivalent to $K_I > -K_E$, which implies $K_I + K_E > 0$.\nLet the effective coupling constant be $K_{eff} = K_I + K_E$. In the control condition, $K_{eff} > 0$.\nThe equation is $\\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = K_{eff} \\sin(\\phi)$.\nThe fixed points of the system are the values of $\\phi$ for which $\\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = 0$. This occurs when $\\sin(\\phi) = 0$, so the fixed points are $\\phi = 0$ and $\\phi = \\pi$.\n\nTo determine the stability of these fixed points, we examine the sign of the derivative of the right-hand side, $H'(\\phi) = K_{eff} \\cos(\\phi)$.\n- At $\\phi = 0$ (synchrony): $H'(0) = K_{eff} \\cos(0) = K_{eff}$. Since $K_{eff} > 0$, this fixed point is unstable.\n- At $\\phi = \\pi$ (alternation): $H'(\\pi) = K_{eff} \\cos(\\pi) = -K_{eff}$. Since $K_{eff} > 0$, we have $-K_{eff} < 0$, so this fixed point is stable.\n\nTherefore, in the control condition, the strong anti-phase coupling $K_I$ dominates the weaker in-phase coupling $K_E$, and the system robustly settles into alternation ($\\phi = \\pi$). This corresponds to the normal swimming pattern of a lamprey.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Perturbed Condition**\n\nThe perturbation involves blocking glycinergic inhibition, which is modeled as $K_I \\to 0$. The parameter $K_E$ is unchanged.\nThe new dynamics are:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = (0 + K_E) \\sin(\\phi) = K_E \\sin(\\phi)\n$$\nWe are given that $K_E < 0$. Let the new effective coupling be $K'_{eff} = K_E$.\nThe fixed points are still $\\phi = 0$ and $\\phi = \\pi$.\nStability analysis with $H'(\\phi) = K_E \\cos(\\phi)$:\n- At $\\phi = 0$ (synchrony): $H'(0) = K_E \\cos(0) = K_E$. Since $K_E < 0$, this fixed point is now stable.\n- At $\\phi = \\pi$ (alternation): $H'(\\pi) = K_E \\cos(\\pi) = -K_E$. Since $K_E < 0$, we have $-K_E > 0$, so this fixed point is now unstable.\n\nThus, after blocking the inhibitory coupling, the dynamics are dominated by the remaining synchronizing coupling $K_E$. The stable state of the CPG shifts from alternation ($\\phi = \\pi$) to synchrony ($\\phi = 0$).\n\n**3. Biomechanical Interpretation of Swimming Efficiency**\n\n- **Normal Swimming (Alternation):** Undulatory locomotion in lampreys is produced by a wave of lateral body bending that travels from head to tail. At any given segment of the body, this bending is achieved by the contraction of muscles on one side and the relaxation of muscles on the other. This is precisely the pattern generated by left-right alternation ($\\phi=\\pi$). This alternating pattern produces thrust against the water, propelling the animal forward.\n- **Perturbed State (Synchrony):** A shift to synchrony ($\\phi=0$) means that the muscles on the left and right sides of the body at a given axial location are activated simultaneously. This phenomenon is known as co-contraction. Instead of producing a bending moment, co-contraction leads to a stiffening of the body segment along the midline. If co-contraction occurs along the body, the lateral propulsive wave is suppressed.\n- **Effect on Efficiency:** Without the propulsive wave, the lamprey cannot generate significant thrust. Its ability to swim is severely compromised or eliminated. Therefore, swimming efficiency drastically decreases.\n\n**Conclusion:** The model predicts that blocking glycinergic inhibition causes the left-right CPG output to shift from alternation to synchrony. Kinesiologically, this leads to co-contraction of trunk musculature, which suppresses the propulsive body wave and dramatically reduces swimming efficiency.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Left–right outputs shift toward near-synchrony with $\\phi \\to 0$ because the remaining coupling is synchronizing; swimming efficiency decreases due to co-contraction that suppresses a traveling lateral wave and reduces thrust.**\nThis option correctly identifies the shift to synchrony ($\\phi \\to 0$) as the stable state is now determined by the synchronizing coupling $K_E < 0$. It also correctly identifies the biomechanical consequence: synchrony leads to co-contraction, which suppresses the propulsive wave and decreases thrust and efficiency. This matches our derivation perfectly.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Left–right outputs remain in strict alternation with $\\phi \\approx \\pi$ because intrinsic membrane oscillations enforce anti-phase; swimming efficiency increases because reduced inhibition lowers metabolic cost without changing the kinematics.**\nThe phase dynamics analysis shows that the stable state shifts away from alternation, so the first clause is incorrect. The model explicitly shows that coupling, not \"intrinsic membrane oscillations\" in isolation, determines the phase relationship. The kinematics change fundamentally, so the premise for the efficiency argument is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Left–right alternation reverses direction along the rostrocaudal axis, producing stronger traveling body waves and increased efficiency, because blocking inhibition unmasks delayed excitation that enhances wave propagation.**\nThis model only describes left-right coordination at a single segmental level, not the rostrocaudal (head-to-tail) coordination that determines the direction of the traveling wave. The prediction of \"reversing direction\" is unsupported. Furthermore, the problem states the system shifts away from alternation to synchrony, contradicting the premise of this option. The claim about \"unmasking delayed excitation\" is an ad-hoc assumption not supported by the problem statement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Left–right outputs become irregular with no consistent phase preference, but swimming efficiency increases because bilateral co-activation stiffens the body and reduces fluid drag.**\nThe model predicts a clear, new stable state ($\\phi=0$), not irregular dynamics. While co-activation does stiffen the body, the idea that this increases efficiency by reducing drag is biomechanically flawed for an undulatory swimmer. Thrust generation, which is eliminated by this stiffening, is far more critical than passive drag reduction for locomotion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Left–right alternation is preserved while the cycle frequency approximately doubles due to shorter inhibitory delays, leading to higher efficiency from higher tailbeat frequency without changes in phase pattern.**\nThe analysis shows that alternation is not preserved; it is replaced by synchrony. Therefore, the central premise of this option is false. Any discussion of frequency or efficiency based on this false premise is invalid.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5005452"}, {"introduction": "Effective locomotion, such as swimming, requires not just local alternation but a precisely coordinated wave of muscle activity that propagates along the body. This is achieved by organizing CPG segments into a chain with specific phase delays between neighbors. This exercise scales up our view from a single circuit to a spatially distributed network, asking how to translate a desired physical outcome—a swimming wave of a specific wavelength—into a required neurophysiological parameter. By treating the body as a discrete chain of oscillators, you will calculate the constant phase lag $\\Delta\\phi$ that must be implemented between adjacent segments to generate the target traveling wave. This practice [@problem_id:5005512] bridges the gap between abstract oscillator theory and the concrete biomechanics of whole-body movement, revealing how spatial patterns are encoded in the CPG network.", "problem": "In vertebrate undulatory locomotion, segmental Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) along the axial cord produce a traveling neuromuscular wave that bends the body and propagates from rostral to caudal. Consider a fish-like body of length $L$ controlled by a discrete chain of nearest-neighbor coupled oscillators arranged along the midline. The chain covers the body with $N$ equal spatial steps, each of length $\\Delta x$, so that $N \\Delta x = L$. The target kinematics is a traveling wave with spatial wave number $k$ along the body.

All provided information, including the foundational facts and definitions, is internally consistent and grounded in the established principles of wave mechanics and the neurobiological modeling of central pattern generators (CPGs). The problem is therefore deemed valid for solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive the constant phase difference, $\\Delta \\phi$, that must be imposed by the coupling between adjacent oscillators in a discrete chain to replicate the kinematics of a continuous traveling wave. The wave is characterized by a spatial wave number $k$ along a body of length $L$. The discrete chain consists of oscillators arranged in $N$ equal spatial steps.\n\nLet the longitudinal position along the body be denoted by the variable $x$, where $x \\in [0, L]$.\n\nFrom the problem statement, the phase of the continuous traveling wave at any position $x$ is given by the function:\n$$\n\\phi(x) = kx + \\phi_0\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the spatial wave number (phase change per unit length) and $\\phi_0$ is a constant reference phase. Without loss of generality, we can set $\\phi_0 = 0$, simplifying the phase profile to:\n$$\n\\phi(x) = kx\n$$\nThis simplification does not affect the calculation of phase differences.\n\nThe problem specifies that the body of length $L$ is discretized into a chain of oscillators separated by $N$ equal spatial steps. Let the length of each spatial step be $\\Delta x$. From the given information, we have the relationship:\n$$\nL = N \\Delta x\n$$\nThis implies that the length of a single spatial step is:\n$$\n\\Delta x = \\frac{L}{N}\n$$\nWe can model the oscillators as being located at discrete positions $x_i$ along the body, where $i$ is an integer index. Let us define the positions of the oscillators as $x_i = i \\Delta x$ for $i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, N$. This places oscillators at the beginning and end of each of the $N$ segments, covering the full length $L$.\n\nThe problem requires that the discrete oscillator chain \"realize the continuous phase profile\". This is a key constraint. It means that the phase of each oscillator in the chain must correspond to the phase of the continuous wave at the oscillator's specific location. The phase of the $i$-th oscillator, $\\phi_i$, is therefore given by $\\phi(x_i)$.\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the required constant phase difference, $\\Delta \\phi$, between any two adjacent oscillators. Let us consider two adjacent oscillators in the chain, indexed by $i$ and $i-1$. Their positions are $x_i = i \\Delta x$ and $x_{i-1} = (i-1) \\Delta x$.\n\nThe phase difference, $\\Delta \\phi$, between these two adjacent oscillators is defined as the difference in their phases:\n$$\n\\Delta \\phi = \\phi_i - \\phi_{i-1}\n$$\nUsing the condition that the discrete phases must match the continuous phase profile at the corresponding locations, we have:\n$$\n\\Delta \\phi = \\phi(x_i) - \\phi(x_{i-1})\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the continuous phase function, $\\phi(x) = kx$, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta \\phi = k x_i - k x_{i-1}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for the positions $x_i$ and $x_{i-1}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\phi = k (i \\Delta x) - k ((i-1) \\Delta x)\n$$\nFactoring out the common terms $k$ and $\\Delta x$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\phi = k \\Delta x (i - (i-1))\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\phi = k \\Delta x (1)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\phi = k \\Delta x\n$$\nThis result shows that to approximate the linear phase profile of the continuous wave, the phase difference between adjacent oscillators must be a constant value equal to the product of the wave number $k$ and the spatial step size $\\Delta x$. This is consistent with the problem's premise of a uniform nearest-neighbor coupling.\n\nThe problem requires the final expression for $\\Delta \\phi$ to be in terms of $k$, $L$, and $N$. We have the relationship $\\Delta x = \\frac{L}{N}$. Substituting this into our expression for $\\Delta \\phi$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\phi = k \\left( \\frac{L}{N} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the required constant phase difference per spatial step, or segment, expressed in radians. It represents the phase lag that each oscillator must have relative to its rostral neighbor to generate a caudal-propagating wave with the target wave number $k$. The total phase lag over the entire length $L$ of the body will be $N \\times \\Delta \\phi = N \\left( \\frac{kL}{N} \\right) = kL$, which correctly matches the total phase advance of the continuous traveling wave, as stated in the foundational facts.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{kL}{N}}$$", "id": "5005512"}]}
