In the independent race model, a response is produced if and only if the go process finishes before the stop process completes. The stop process is initiated at a stop-signal delay (SSD) after the go stimulus. Let the \"go\" finishing times be represented by the empirical distribution of go reaction times (RTs) from no-stop trials, and let the stop process have a characteristic latency, the Stop-Signal Reaction Time (SSRT).\n\nStarting from the following foundational definitions and facts:\n- The race model assumes stochastic independence between the go finishing time and the stop finishing time.\n- A response on a stop trial occurs if the go finishing time is less than the stop finishing time. Under the assumption that the stop finishing time equals $\\mathrm{SSD} + \\mathrm{SSRT}$, the probability of responding given a stop signal equals the probability that the go finishing time is less than $\\mathrm{SSD} + \\mathrm{SSRT}$.\n- The empirical cumulative distribution function of go RTs, denoted $F_{\\mathrm{go}}(t)$, gives the probability that the go finishing time is less than or equal to $t$.\n\nUse these principles to derive the integration-based estimator of the Stop-Signal Reaction Time (SSRT), and then compute it for the dataset below.

The independent race model posits that on a stop-signal trial, a \"go\" process, initiated by a go stimulus, races against a \"stop\" process, initiated by a stop signal. A motor response is executed if and only if the go process finishes before the stop process.\n\nLet $T_{go}$ be the random variable representing the finishing time of the go process. The distribution of $T_{go}$ is given by the empirical distribution of reaction times (RTs) from no-stop (go-only) trials.\nLet $T_{stop}$ be the random variable representing the finishing time of the stop process.\nThe stop signal is presented at a Stop-Signal Delay (SSD) after the go stimulus. The stop process itself has a latency, the SSRT. A core assumption of the model for estimation purposes is that the finishing time of the stop process is the sum of the SSD and the SSRT.\n$$T_{stop} = \\mathrm{SSD} + \\mathrm{SSRT}$$\nThis formulation often treats SSRT as a constant parameter to be estimated, rather than a random variable.\n\nA response is made if $T_{go} < T_{stop}$. Substituting the expression for $T_{stop}$, this condition becomes:\n$$T_{go} < \\mathrm{SSD} + \\mathrm{SSRT}$$\nThe probability of this event occurring on a stop trial with a given SSD, which is the probability of responding, is:\n$$p(\\text{respond} | \\mathrm{SSD}) = P(T_{go} < \\mathrm{SSD} + \\mathrm{SSRT})$$\nThis probability can be expressed using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the go finishing times, $F_{go}(t) = P(T_{go} \\le t)$. Assuming a continuous distribution for $T_{go}$ (or for a discrete distribution where the inequality is treated as non-strict, as is common), we have:\n$$p(\\text{respond} | \\mathrm{SSD}) = F_{go}(\\mathrm{SSD} + \\mathrm{SSRT})$$\nThe \"integration method\" for estimating SSRT over a block of trials with varying SSDs uses the overall probability of responding, $p(\\text{respond})$, and the mean stop-signal delay, $\\overline{\\mathrm{SSD}}$. The model equation is thus approximated as:\n$$p(\\text{respond}) \\approx F_{go}(\\overline{\\mathrm{SSD}} + \\mathrm{SSRT})$$\nTo solve for SSRT, we must isolate it.
