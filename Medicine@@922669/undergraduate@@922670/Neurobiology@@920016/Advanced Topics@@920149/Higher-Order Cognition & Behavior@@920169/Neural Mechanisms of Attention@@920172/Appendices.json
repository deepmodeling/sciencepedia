The discriminability index for two responses drawn from Gaussian distributions with means $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ and a common standard deviation $\\sigma$ is defined as:\n$$\nd' = \\frac{|\\mu_1 - \\mu_2|}{\\sigma}\n$$\nIn this context, the two responses are the spike counts for a preferred and a non-preferred stimulus. Let $\\mu_p$ and $\\mu_n$ be the mean spike counts for the preferred and non-preferred stimuli, respectively. Without loss of generality, we assume $\\mu_p > \\mu_n$.\n\nFirst, we define the discriminability for the baseline (unattended) condition, denoted as $d'_{\\mathrm{base}}$.

According to the problem, attention introduces multiplicative scaling. The means are scaled by a factor of $(1+g)$, and the variance is scaled by a factor of $(1-v)$. Let the parameters in the attended condition be denoted with the subscript 'att'.\n\nThe new means are given by:\n$$\n\\mu_{p, \\mathrm{att}} = \\mu_{p, \\mathrm{base}}(1+g)\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_{n, \\mathrm{att}} = \\mu_{n, \\mathrm{base}}(1+g)\n$$\nThe new variance is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{att}}^2 = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{base}}^2(1-v)\n$$\nThe new standard deviation is the square root of the new variance:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{att}} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{base}}^2(1-v)} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{base}}\\sqrt{1-v}\n$$\n\nNow we can write the expression for the discriminability index under attention, $d'_{\\mathrm{att}}$:\n$$\nd'_{\\mathrm{att}} = \\frac{\\mu_{p, \\mathrm{att}} - \\mu_{n, \\mathrm{att}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{att}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the attended parameters into this equation yields:\n$$\nd'_{\\mathrm{att}} = \\frac{\\mu_{p, \\mathrm{base}}(1+g) - \\mu_{n, \\mathrm{base}}(1+g)}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{base}}\\sqrt{1-v}}\n$$\nWe can factor out $(1+g)$ from the numerator:\n$$\nd'_{\\mathrm{att}} = \\frac{(\\mu_{p, \\mathrm{base}} - \\mu_{n, \\mathrm{base}})(1+g)}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{base}}\\sqrt{1-v}}\n$$\nTo reveal the scaling relationship, we can rearrange the terms to isolate the expression for $d'_{\\mathrm{base}}$:\n$$\nd'_{\\mathrm{att}} = \\left(\\frac{\\mu_{p, \\mathrm{base}} - \\mu_{n, \\mathrm{base}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{base}}}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1+g}{\\sqrt{1-v}}\n$$\nBy substituting the definition of $d'_{\\mathrm{base}}$, we derive the scaling law:\n$$\nd'_{\\mathrm{att}} = d'_{\\mathrm{base}} \\cdot \\frac{1+g}{\\sqrt{1-v}}\n$$\nThis equation represents the scaling of the discriminability index due to the multiplicative attentional modulation.\n\nThe problem requires us to compute the multiplicative change factor, $R$, defined as $R = d'_{\\mathrm{att}} / d'_{\\mathrm{base}}$.

The denominator represents the total suppressive drive. It is composed of a constant baseline suppression $\\sigma$ and the stimulus-driven normalization pool $N = g_{1}s_{1} + g_{2}s_{2}$. Critically, the normalization pool sums the attention-modulated drives from *all* stimuli. When attention is directed to stimulus $1$, its gain $g_{1}$ is increased ($g_{1}=1.4$). This boosts the contribution of stimulus $1$ to the shared normalization pool ($g_{1}s_{1} = 14$). This larger pool value, $N=22$, divisively suppresses the responses of *all* neurons, including neuron $2$. Therefore, the enhanced excitatory drive of the attended stimulus leads to stronger suppression of the competing, unattended stimulus. This is the mechanism of competitive suppression within the divisive normalization framework.

Consider a simplified two-channel model in which each location $x$ is characterized by two nonnegative inputs: a bottom-up salience signal $s(x)$ and a top-down value signal $v(x)$, both normalized to the range $[0,1]$. Assume the following foundational principles: (1) single-neuron firing rates in such maps are approximately proportional to a weighted sum of synaptic inputs (linear rate-coding under low to moderate firing regimes), (2) task demands modulate channel-specific gains $\\alpha \\ge 0$ and $\\beta \\ge 0$ through neuromodulation or feedback, and (3) downstream selection follows a winner-take-all rule that selects the location with the highest priority signal, that is, $\\arg\\max_x p(x)$. \n\n(a) Using these assumptions only, derive a general expression for the priority signal $p(x)$ at any location $x$ in terms of the gains and the two input channels.

Express your final numeric answer as a reduced fraction. The final answer must be the single value of $\\beta/\\alpha$ with no units.", "solution": "(a) Derivation of the priority signal expression.\n\nPrinciple (1) posits that the neural firing rate, which we take to be the priority signal $p(x)$, is proportional to a weighted sum of its inputs. The inputs for a neuron at location $x$ are the salience signal $s(x)$ and the value signal $v(x)$.\n\nPrinciple (2) introduces channel-specific gains $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ that modulate these inputs. A natural formalization is to assign gain $\\alpha$ to the salience channel and gain $\\beta$ to the value channel. The weighted sum of inputs can thus be written as $\\alpha s(x) + \\beta v(x)$.\n\nCombining these, the priority signal $p(x)$ is proportional to this sum:\n$$p(x) \\propto \\alpha s(x) + \\beta v(x)$$\nThis can be expressed with a constant of proportionality, $k > 0$:\n$$p(x) = k(\\alpha s(x) + \\beta v(x))$$\nPrinciple (3) states that selection is determined by a winner-take-all rule, which identifies the location corresponding to the maximum value of $p(x)$. The operation of finding the argument of the maximum, $\\arg\\max_x p(x)$, is invariant to scaling by a positive constant $k$. That is:\n$$\\arg\\max_x p(x) = \\arg\\max_x [k(\\alpha s(x) + \\beta v(x))] = \\arg\\max_x [\\alpha s(x) + \\beta v(x)]$$\nBecause the constant of proportionality $k$ has no effect on the outcome of the selection process, we can, without loss of generality, set $k=1$. This is the minimal structural assumption required to provide a specific functional form for $p(x)$. Thus, the general expression for the priority signal is a linear weighted sum of the inputs:\n$$p(x) = \\alpha s(x) + \\beta v(x)$$\nThis expression directly reflects the integration of channel-specific information, modulated by task-dependent gains.\n\n(b) Derivation and computation of the critical gain ratio.\n\nThe decision boundary between selecting location $x_1$ and location $x_2$ is the set of conditions under which both locations have equal priority. This is specified by the equation $p(x_1) = p(x_2)$.\nUsing the expression for $p(x)$ derived in part (a):\n$$\\alpha s(x_1) + \\beta v(x_1) = \\alpha s(x_2) + \\beta v(x_2)$$\nTo find the critical gain ratio $\\beta/\\alpha$, we rearrange this equation to isolate terms involving $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n$$\\beta v(x_1) - \\beta v(x_2) = \\alpha s(x_2) - \\alpha s(x_1)$$\nFactoring out the gains $\\beta$ and $\\alpha$:\n$$\\beta (v(x_1) - v(x_2)) = \\alpha (s(x_2) - s(x_1))$$\nTo solve for the ratio $\\beta/\\alpha$, we divide both sides by $\\alpha$ and by $(v(x_1) - v(x_2))$. This is permissible assuming $\\alpha \\neq 0$ and $v(x_1) \\neq v(x_2)$. The context of a \"decision boundary\" implies that both gains can be non-zero and contribute to the decision, so $\\alpha \\neq 0$ is a reasonable assumption. The given values confirm that $v(x_1) \\neq v(x_2)$.\nThe resulting analytic expression for the critical gain ratio is:\n$$\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} = \\frac{s(x_2) - s(x_1)}{v(x_1) - v(x_2)}$$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values: $s(x_1)=0.7$, $v(x_1)=0.1$, $s(x_2)=0.4$, and $v(x_2)=0.6$.\n$$\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} = \\frac{0.4 - 0.7}{0.1 - 0.6}$$\n$$\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} = \\frac{-0.3}{-0.5}$$\nThe ratio simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} = \\frac{0.3}{0.5} = \\frac{3/10}{5/10} = \\frac{3}{5}$$\nThe critical gain ratio $\\beta/\\alpha$ is $\\frac{3}{5}$. If the ratio is greater than this value, the value signal $v(x)$ is weighted more heavily, and location $x_2$ (with higher $v$) would be selected.
