The problem is self-contained and internally consistent; for instance, the condition $k_{\\text{deg}}\\,T_{\\text{dep}} \\ll 1$ holds for the parameters in Task $2$, as $k_{\\text{deg}}T_{\\text{dep}} = ((\\ln 2)/5.0\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\cdot (1.0\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\approx 0.14$, which is indeed much less than $1$. No flaws are identified.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Task 1: Minimal induction condition for DSI**\n\nThe induction of DSI requires that the presynaptic concentration of $2$-AG, which we denote as $[\\text{2-AG}]_{\\text{pre}}$, reaches or exceeds a threshold $C_{\\text{thr}}$ at a certain point in time. The peak production of $2$-AG occurs at the end of the depolarization, $t=T_{\\text{dep}}$. The condition for DSI induction is therefore that the presynaptic $2$-AG concentration at this time is at least $C_{\\text{thr}}$:\n$$\n[\\text{2-AG}]_{\\text{pre}}(T_{\\text{dep}}) \\ge C_{\\text{thr}}\n$$\nThe problem states that a fraction $\\alpha$ of the total $2$-AG synthesized in the postsynaptic compartment, $[\\text{2-AG}]_{\\text{post}}$, reaches the presynaptic terminals. Thus, $[\\text{2-AG}]_{\\text{pre}}(T_{\\text{dep}}) = \\alpha [\\text{2-AG}]_{\\text{post}}(T_{\\text{dep}})$.\n\nBased on the assumption that degradation is negligible during synthesis, the postsynaptic concentration at $t=T_{\\text{dep}}$ is the time integral of the synthesis rate $v_{\\text{syn}}(t)$ from $t=0$ to $t=T_{\\text{dep}}$:\n$$\n[\\text{2-AG}]_{\\text{post}}(T_{\\text{dep}}) = \\int_{0}^{T_{\\text{dep}}} v_{\\text{syn}}(t) \\, dt\n$$\nCombining these relations, the DSI induction condition is:\n$$\n\\alpha \\int_{0}^{T_{\\text{dep}}} V_{\\max}\\,\\frac{\\left([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}](t)\\right)^{n}}{K_{\\mathrm{Ca}}^{n} + \\left([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}](t)\\right)^{n}} \\, dt \\ge C_{\\text{thr}}\n$$\nThe integrand is a complex function of time. A direct analytical integration is intractable. However, we can make a well-justified approximation. The time constant for the calcium rise is $\\tau_c = 0.050\\,\\mathrm{s}$. Depolarizations that induce DSI are typically on the order of seconds, meaning $T_{\\text{dep}} \\gg \\tau_c$. Under this condition, the intracellular calcium concentration $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}](t)$ rapidly rises to its steady-state plateau value, $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{ss}}$. We can therefore approximate the calcium concentration as being constant at this plateau value for the entire duration of the depolarization.\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{ss}} = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}](t) = [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{rest}} + \\Delta\n$$\nWith this approximation, the synthesis rate $v_{\\text{syn}}(t)$ becomes a constant, $v_{\\text{syn,ss}}$:\n$$\nv_{\\text{syn,ss}} = V_{\\max}\\,\\frac{\\left([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{ss}}\\right)^{n}}{K_{\\mathrm{Ca}}^{n} + \\left([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{ss}}\\right)^{n}} = V_{\\max}\\,\\frac{\\left([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{rest}} + \\Delta\\right)^{n}}{K_{\\mathrm{Ca}}^{n} + \\left([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{rest}} + \\Delta\\right)^{n}}\n$$\nThe integral simplifies to:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T_{\\text{dep}}} v_{\\text{syn}}(t) \\, dt \\approx v_{\\text{syn,ss}} \\cdot T_{\\text{dep}}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the DSI condition gives:\n$$\n\\alpha \\cdot v_{\\text{syn,ss}} \\cdot T_{\\text{dep}} \\ge C_{\\text{thr}}\n$$\nSolving for $T_{\\text{dep}}$ gives the minimal induction condition:\n$$\nT_{\\text{dep}} \\ge \\frac{C_{\\text{thr}}}{\\alpha \\, v_{\\text{syn,ss}}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{thr}}}{\\alpha V_{\\max}} \\left( \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{Ca}}^{n} + \\left([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{rest}} + \\Delta\\right)^{n}}{\\left([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{rest}} + \\Delta\\right)^{n}} \\right)\n$$\nThis can be written more cleanly as:\n$$\nT_{\\text{dep}} \\ge \\frac{C_{\\text{thr}}}{\\alpha V_{\\max}} \\left( 1 + \\left(\\frac{K_{\\mathrm{Ca}}}{[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{rest}} + \\Delta}\\right)^{n} \\right)\n$$\n\n**Task 2: Time window for DSI with $T_{\\text{dep}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$**\n\nFor a depolarization of $T_{\\text{dep}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$, we first calculate the peak presynaptic $2$-AG concentration, $[\\text{2-AG}]_{\\text{pre,peak}}$, achieved at $t=T_{\\text{dep}}$. Given that $T_{\\text{dep}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$ and $\\tau_c = 0.050\\,\\mathrm{s}$, the condition $T_{\\text{dep}} \\gg \\tau_c$ is well satisfied ($T_{\\text{dep}} = 20\\tau_c$), validating the use of the steady-state approximation from Task 1.\n\nThe steady-state calcium concentration is:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{ss}} = [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{rest}} + \\Delta = 0.10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} + 1.40\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} = 1.50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\n$$\nThe corresponding steady-state synthesis rate is:\n$$\nv_{\\text{syn,ss}} = V_{\\max}\\,\\frac{\\left([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{ss}}\\right)^{n}}{K_{\\mathrm{Ca}}^{n} + \\left([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{ss}}\\right)^{n}} = (1.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\frac{(1.50)^2}{(0.50)^2 + (1.50)^2} = 1.0 \\cdot \\frac{2.25}{0.25 + 2.25} \\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.90\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe total postsynaptic $2$-AG produced is:\n$$\n[\\text{2-AG}]_{\\text{post}}(T_{\\text{dep}}) \\approx v_{\\text{syn,ss}} \\cdot T_{\\text{dep}} = (0.90\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (1.0\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 0.90\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\n$$\nThe peak presynaptic concentration is then:\n$$\n[\\text{2-AG}]_{\\text{pre,peak}} = \\alpha \\cdot [\\text{2-AG}]_{\\text{post}}(T_{\\text{dep}}) = 0.60 \\cdot 0.90\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} = 0.54\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\n$$\nAfter the depolarization ends (for $t > T_{\\text{dep}}$), $2$-AG production ceases, and its concentration decays via first-order kinetics. Let $t' = t - T_{\\text{dep}}$ be the time elapsed since the end of the depolarization. The presynaptic concentration $[\\text{2-AG}]_{\\text{pre}}(t')$ is given by:\n$$\n[\\text{2-AG}]_{\\text{pre}}(t') = [\\text{2-AG}]_{\\text{pre,peak}} \\exp(-k_{\\text{deg}} t')\n$$\nThe decay constant $k_{\\text{deg}}$ is determined by the half-life $t_{1/2} = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$:\n$$\nk_{\\text{deg}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{5.0\\,\\mathrm{s}}\n$$\nWe need to find the time window $t_{\\text{win}}$ during which $[\\text{2-AG}]_{\\text{pre}}(t')$ remains above the threshold $C_{\\text{thr}} = 0.30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.
