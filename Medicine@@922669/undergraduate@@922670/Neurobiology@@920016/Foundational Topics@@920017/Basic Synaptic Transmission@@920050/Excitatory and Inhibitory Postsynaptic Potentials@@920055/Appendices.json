This practice explores the fundamental process of spatial summation, where a neuron integrates simultaneous excitatory and inhibitory signals arriving at different locations on its surface. By calculating the net effect of these competing inputs, you will gain a foundational understanding of the basic arithmetic that governs neuronal processing [@problem_id:1705874].", "problem": "A motor neuron in the spinal cord, which maintains a stable resting membrane potential, is responsible for controlling a muscle fiber. This neuron integrates incoming signals at its axon hillock to determine whether to fire an action potential. In a specific instance, this motor neuron receives signals from multiple sources simultaneously. It receives input from 7 excitatory synapses, where each synapse activation produces an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP) that causes a depolarization of +1.5 mV. Concurrently, it receives input from 3 inhibitory synapses, each generating an Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP) that results in a hyperpolarization of -4.5 mV.

The neuron under study has a stable resting membrane potential of $-68$ mV and a threshold potential of $-50$ mV required to trigger an action potential.\n\nThe neuron receives inputs from two other neurons, designated Neuron X and Neuron Y. When Neuron X fires, it produces an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP) that results in a $+11$ mV depolarization at the axon hillock of the target neuron. When Neuron Y fires, it produces an Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP) that results in a $-7$ mV hyperpolarization at the same location.\n\nIn a specific experiment, Neuron X is stimulated twice in rapid succession, allowing for perfect temporal summation of its two EPSPs.

However, this is an incomplete picture. This exercise reveals a powerful and subtle form of inhibition known as shunting, which can occur without any change in membrane potential. Understanding this mechanism [@problem_id:1705866] is crucial, as it shows how opening ion channels can increase membrane conductance, effectively short-circuiting excitatory currents and regulating neuronal excitability in a divisive rather than subtractive manner.", "problem": "In the central nervous system, synaptic inhibition is crucial for shaping neural circuit activity. One common mechanism involves neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) binding to ligand-gated ion channels that are permeable to chloride ions ($Cl^{-}$). Consider a postsynaptic neuron whose membrane potential ($V_m$) is momentarily held at -70 mV. At this exact moment, an inhibitory synapse on its dendrite is activated, opening a population of these anion-specific channels. For this particular neuron, under these specific ionic conditions, the Nernst potential for chloride ions ($E_{Cl}$) is also exactly -70 mV.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate consequence of the activation of this inhibitory synapse?\n\nA. A net influx of chloride ions occurs, causing the membrane potential to become more negative in a process known as hyperpolarization.\n\nB. A net efflux of chloride ions occurs, causing the membrane potential to become less negative in a process known as depolarization.\n\nC. There is no net flow of chloride ions across the membrane, and therefore the synapse has no physiological effect on the neuron's excitability at this moment.\n\nD. There is no net flow of chloride ions and no change in the membrane potential, but the total membrane resistance decreases, making the neuron less responsive to subsequent excitatory inputs.", "solution": "We use the standard ohmic description of synaptic currents for a ligand-gated ion channel selective for chloride. The chloride current satisfies\n$$\nI_{Cl}=g_{Cl}\\left(V_{m}-E_{Cl}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $g_{Cl}$ is the chloride conductance when the channels are open, $V_{m}$ is the membrane potential, and $E_{Cl}$ is the Nernst (reversal) potential for chloride.\n\nAt the instant considered, it is given that $V_{m}=E_{Cl}$. Therefore, the driving force is\n$$\nV_{m}-E_{Cl}=0,\n$$\nand hence\n$$\nI_{Cl}=g_{Cl}\\cdot 0=0.\n$$\nThus, immediately upon channel opening, there is no net chloride flux and no immediate change in $V_{m}$.\n\nHowever, opening the channels increases the membrane conductance. Let the baseline membrane conductance be $G_{m}$ (with input resistance $R_{in}=1/G_{m}$). When chloride channels open, the total conductance becomes\n$$\nG_{m}'=G_{m}+g_{Cl},\n$$\nso the input resistance becomes\n$$\nR_{in}'=\\frac{1}{G_{m}'}=\\frac{1}{G_{m}+g_{Cl}}<\\frac{1}{G_{m}}=R_{in}.\n$$\nA decreased input resistance reduces the voltage response to any subsequent synaptic or injected current, since a given current $I$ produces a voltage change $\\Delta V=I/G_{m}'$ that is smaller than $\\Delta V=I/G_{m}$. This divisive, “shunting” effect diminishes excitatory postsynaptic potentials without requiring a change in $V_{m}$ at the moment of inhibitory channel opening.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that there is no net chloride flow and no immediate change in membrane potential, but the membrane resistance decreases, making the neuron less responsive to excitatory inputs.\n\nThe correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1705866"}]}
