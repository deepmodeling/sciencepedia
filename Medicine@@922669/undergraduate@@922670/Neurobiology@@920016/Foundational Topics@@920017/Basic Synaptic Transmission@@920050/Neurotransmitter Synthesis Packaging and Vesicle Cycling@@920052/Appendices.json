The chemiosmotic coupling model, wherein a primary pump (V-ATPase) establishes a proton electrochemical gradient that is then used by a secondary transporter (VGAT), is the canonical mechanism for loading most small-molecule neurotransmitters into vesicles. All components mentioned (V-ATPase, VGAT, SNAREs) and concepts ($\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$, $\\Delta \\psi$, mIPSCs) are standard in the field.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It clearly defines the system, the manipulation, and crucial boundary conditions (e.g., constant cytosolic GABA, no compensation by $\\Delta \\psi$, unchanged release machinery). This allows for the isolation of the variable of interest ($\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$) and the deduction of its specific consequences.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms, free from ambiguity or subjective interpretation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no discernible flaws. Therefore, the problem is **valid**, and a solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution from First Principles\n\n1.  **Electrochemical Potential and Driving Force**: The transport of substances across a membrane is governed by their electrochemical potential difference. For an ion, this includes both a chemical (concentration) component and an electrical (potential) component. The total free energy change for moving a mole of protons ($H^+$) from the cytosol ('cyto') into the vesicle lumen ('lumen') is given by the change in their electrochemical potential, $\\Delta \\mu_{H^+}$:\n    $$ \\Delta \\mu_{H^+} = R T \\ln\\frac{[H^+]_{lumen}}{[H^+]_{cyto}} + z F (\\psi_{lumen} - \\psi_{cyto}) $$\n    where $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $z$ is the charge of the ion (for $H^+$, $z = +1$), $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $\\psi$ is the electrical potential.\n\n2.  **Relating to $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ and $\\Delta \\psi$**: The terms in the equation can be expressed using the given variables.\n    -   The electrical potential difference across the vesicle membrane is $\\Delta \\psi = \\psi_{lumen} - \\psi_{cyto}$. The V-ATPase pumps protons into the vesicle, making the lumen electrically positive relative to the cytosol, so $\\Delta \\psi > 0$.\n    -   The pH is defined as $\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}[H^+]$. The logarithmic term can be rewritten as:\n        $$ R T \\ln\\frac{[H^+]_{lumen}}{[H^+]_{cyto}} = R T \\ln(10^{-\\mathrm{pH}_{lumen}} / 10^{-\\mathrm{pH}_{cyto}}) = R T \\ln(10^{\\mathrm{pH}_{cyto} - \\mathrm{pH}_{lumen}}) $$\n        $$ = (\\ln 10) R T (\\mathrm{pH}_{cyto} - \\mathrm{pH}_{lumen}) = -2.303 R T \\Delta \\mathrm{pH}_{lumen-cyto} $$\n        The problem defines $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ such that a more acidic lumen ($\\mathrm{pH}_{lumen} < \\mathrm{pH}_{cyto}$) corresponds to a positive energy contribution. Let's define $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{pH}_{cyto} - \\mathrm{pH}_{lumen} > 0$. The potential energy stored in the pH gradient for inward proton movement is thus $-2.303 R T \\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$. The energy for *outward* proton movement, which drives GABA import, is $+2.303 R T \\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$.\n\n3.  **Thermodynamics of VGAT Antiport**: VGAT is an antiporter that couples the efflux of $n$ protons from the lumen to the influx of one molecule of GABA into the lumen. At physiological pH, GABA is primarily a zwitterion and is electrically neutral. Its transport is driven solely by its chemical potential difference.\n    -   The free energy change to move one mole of GABA from the cytosol to the lumen is:\n        $$ \\Delta G_{GABA} = R T \\ln\\frac{[GABA]_{lumen}}{[GABA]_{cyto}} $$\n    -   The free energy change to move $n$ moles of protons from the lumen to the cytosol is:\n        $$ \\Delta G_{H^+} = -n \\Delta \\mu_{H^+} = -n \\left( R T \\ln\\frac{[H^+]_{lumen}}{[H^+]_{cyto}} + F \\Delta \\psi \\right) = -n \\left(-2.303 R T \\Delta \\mathrm{pH} + F \\Delta \\psi \\right) $$\n        However, the total driving force provided by the proton gradient (the \"proton-motive force\") is harvested by the transporter. The energy available from moving $n$ protons **out** is:\n        $$ \\Delta G_{H^+ \\ (driving)} = -n(2.303 RT \\Delta \\mathrm{pH} + F \\Delta \\psi) $$\n        This is the energy term that pays for GABA accumulation.\n\n4.  **Steady-State Condition**: The problem states that at steady state, the net free energy change for the coupled transport process is zero. This occurs when the energy required to accumulate GABA against its concentration gradient exactly balances the energy provided by the proton gradient.\n    $$ \\Delta G_{GABA} + \\Delta G_{H^+ \\ (driving)} = 0 $$\n    $$ R T \\ln\\frac{[GABA]_{lumen}}{[GABA]_{cyto}} - n(2.303 R T \\Delta \\mathrm{pH} + F \\Delta \\psi) = 0 $$\n    Solving for the steady-state GABA concentration ratio:\n    $$ \\ln\\frac{[GABA]_{lumen}}{[GABA]_{cyto}} = \\frac{n}{RT} (2.303 R T \\Delta \\mathrm{pH} + F \\Delta \\psi) $$\n    $$ \\frac{[GABA]_{lumen}}{[GABA]_{cyto}} = \\exp\\left[ n \\left( 2.303 \\Delta \\mathrm{pH} + \\frac{F \\Delta \\psi}{RT} \\right) \\right] $$\n    This equation demonstrates that the ability of the vesicle to concentrate GABA is exponentially dependent on the weighted sum of both the pH gradient ($\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$) and the membrane potential ($\\Delta \\psi$).\n\n5.  **Effect of Vesicle Alkalinization**:\n    -   The manipulation \"alkalinizes the vesicle lumen,\" which means $\\mathrm{pH}_{lumen}$ increases.\n    -   Since $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{pH}_{cyto} - \\mathrm{pH}_{lumen}$, an increase in $\\mathrm{pH}_{lumen}$ causes a **decrease** in $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$.\n    -   According to the problem, $\\Delta \\psi$ does not increase to compensate.\n    -   Therefore, the total driving force for GABA accumulation, which is proportional to $(2.303 R T \\Delta \\mathrm{pH} + F \\Delta \\psi)$, unequivocally **decreases**.\n    -   With a lower driving force, the steady-state concentration of GABA in the vesicle, $[GABA]_{lumen}$, will be lower.\n\n6.  **Consequences for mIPSCs**:\n    -   **Quantal Content ($Q$)**: $Q$ is the number of GABA molecules per vesicle. Since vesicle volume is constant, $Q$ is directly proportional to $[GABA]_{lumen}$. A decrease in $[GABA]_{lumen}$ directly causes a **decrease** in $Q$.\n    -   **mIPSC Amplitude**: The amplitude of an mIPSC is determined by the postsynaptic current generated by the contents of a single vesicle. A lower $Q$ means fewer GABA molecules are released into the synaptic cleft upon vesicle fusion. This leads to a lower peak transient concentration of GABA in the cleft, reduced activation of postsynaptic GABA receptors, and consequently, a **decrease** in the mean mIPSC amplitude.\n    -   **mIPSC Frequency**: The frequency of mIPSCs reflects the rate of spontaneous, action-potential-independent vesicle fusion. The problem explicitly states that the manipulation does not affect the core machinery of exocytosis (SNAREs, docking, release probability). Therefore, the rate of spontaneous fusion events should be unaffected, and mIPSC frequency will **remain unchanged**.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Mean mIPSC amplitude decreases while mIPSC frequency remains unchanged, because lowering $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ reduces VGAT’s driving force and lowers $Q$ without altering vesicle release probability or docking.**\n-   This option posits a decrease in mIPSC amplitude and no change in frequency. The reasoning provided is that lowering $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ (correctly interpreted from alkalinization) reduces the driving force for VGAT, which lowers quantal content ($Q$), while release probability is unaltered. This aligns perfectly with the derivation from first principles.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Mean mIPSC amplitude increases while mIPSC frequency remains unchanged, because lowering $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ increases VGAT’s exchange rate and raises $Q$ independently of exocytosis.**\n-   This option incorrectly claims that lowering $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ increases the driving force and raises $Q$. This contradicts the thermodynamic analysis. A lower driving force will lead to less, not more, accumulation of GABA. Consequently, the prediction of increased mIPSC amplitude is incorrect.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Mean mIPSC amplitude remains unchanged while mIPSC frequency decreases, because vesicle alkalinization impairs SNARE-mediated docking, reducing release probability without affecting packaging.**\n-   This option makes two false claims based on the problem statement. First, it asserts that release probability is reduced, directly contradicting the given constraint that SNARE function, docking, and release probability are unchanged. Second, it claims that packaging is unaffected, which is the primary process altered by changing the proton gradient.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. No change in mean mIPSC amplitude or frequency, because vesicle packaging by VGAT depends only on $\\Delta \\psi$ and not on $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ when cytosolic GABA is constant.**\n-   The core premise that VGAT depends only on $\\Delta \\psi$ is fundamentally flawed. VGAT, as a proton antiporter, utilizes the *entire* proton electrochemical gradient, which has both $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ (chemical) and $\\Delta \\psi$ (electrical) components. Ignoring the $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ component is incorrect. Therefore, the prediction of no change in amplitude is invalid.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Both mean mIPSC amplitude and frequency increase, because alkalinizing the vesicle increases the energy available for VGAT antiport and accelerates vesicle fusion.**\n-   This option is incorrect on two counts. First, alkalinizing the vesicle *decreases* the energy available from the pH gradient component of the proton-motive force. Second, it baselessly assumes that alkalinization accelerates vesicle fusion, a claim for which no support is given and which is implicitly ruled out by the problem's constraints.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5045185"}, {"introduction": "To fully appreciate the efficiency of synaptic transmission, it's helpful to think in terms of absolute numbers and timescales.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to determine the minimum time, $t$, required for the liposome to reach the specified target concentration of glutamate. The solution proceeds in three stages:\n1.  Calculate the total number of glutamate molecules, $N_{Glu}$, that corresponds to the target concentration in the given lumenal volume.\n2.  Calculate the total rate of transport, $R_{total}$, by which glutamate molecules are pumped into the liposome.\n3.  Calculate the required time $t$ by dividing the total number of molecules by the total transport rate.\n\nFirst, we determine the target number of glutamate molecules, $N_{Glu}$. This is based on the definition of molarity, which relates concentration ($C$), volume ($V$), and the number of moles ($n$). The number of molecules is then found using Avogadro's number, $N_A$.\n\nThe target number of moles of glutamate is:\n$$n_{Glu} = [Glu]_{target} \\times V$$\nThe target number of individual glutamate molecules is:\n$$N_{Glu} = n_{Glu} \\times N_A = [Glu]_{target} \\times V \\times N_A$$\n\nWe must use a consistent set of units. The given values are:\n- $[Glu]_{target} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 100 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol \\cdot L^{-1}} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{mol \\cdot L^{-1}}$\n- $V = 30\\,\\mathrm{aL} = 30 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{L}$\n- $N_A = 6.022 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $N_{Glu}$:\n$$N_{Glu} = (0.1\\,\\mathrm{mol \\cdot L^{-1}}) \\times (30 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{L}) \\times (6.022 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}})$$\n$$N_{Glu} = (3 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{mol}) \\times (6.022 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}})$$\n$$N_{Glu} = 18.066 \\times 10^{5} = 1.8066 \\times 10^{6}$$\n\nSo, $1.8066 \\times 10^{6}$ molecules of glutamate must be transported into the liposome.\n\nNext, we calculate the total transport rate, $R_{total}$. The liposome membrane contains $N=50$ transporters, each with a catalytic turnover number of $k_{cat} = 20\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. The problem states that each catalytic cycle transports one glutamate molecule. Thus, $k_{cat}$ represents the number of molecules transported per transporter per second.
