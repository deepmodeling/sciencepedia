The probability mass function (PMF) of a Poisson distribution is:\n$$\n\\Pr(n=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}\n$$\nfor $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\nThe first task is to express $\\lambda$ in terms of the failure rate $P_0$. The failure rate is the probability of zero vesicles being released, which corresponds to $k=0$ in the PMF:\n$$\nP_0 = \\Pr(n=0) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{0!}\n$$\nUsing the mathematical definitions $\\lambda^0 = 1$ and $0! = 1$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\nP_0 = \\exp(-\\lambda)\n$$\nTo solve for $\\lambda$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\ln(P_0) = \\ln(\\exp(-\\lambda))\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(P_0) = -\\lambda\n$$\nThis gives the symbolic expression for $\\lambda$ in terms of $P_0$:\n$$\n\\lambda = -\\ln(P_0)\n$$\nUsing the provided numerical value $P_0 = 0.19$, we can calculate $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = -\\ln(0.19) \\approx 1.6607345\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we get $\\lambda \\approx 1.661$.\n\nThe second task is to compute the mean amplitude, $E[A]$. The amplitude $A$ is related to the number of vesicles $n$ by $A = q \\, n$. The mean amplitude is the expected value of $A$:\n$$\nE[A] = E[q \\, n]\n$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, the constant quantal size $q$ can be factored out:\n$$\nE[A] = q \\, E[n]\n$$\nA fundamental property of the Poisson distribution is that its mean (expected value) is equal to its parameter. Therefore, $E[n] = \\lambda$. Substituting this into the equation for the mean amplitude, we obtain the symbolic relationship:\n$$\nE[A] = q \\, \\lambda\n$$\nWe can now calculate the numerical value of $E[A]$ using the given quantal size $q = 14.7 \\ \\mathrm{pA}$ and the previously calculated value of $\\lambda$. To maintain precision, we use the unrounded value for $\\lambda$:\n$$\nE[A] = (14.7) \\times (-\\ln(0.19)) \\approx (14.7) \\times (1.6607345) \\approx 24.412797 \\ \\mathrm{pA}\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives:\n$$\nE[A] \\approx 24.41 \\ \\mathrm{pA}\n$$\nThe required output is a two-entry row vector with the computed values for $\\lambda$ and $E[A]$, both rounded to four significant figures.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.661  24.41\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5055498"}, {"introduction": "While the Poisson model is a useful approximation, a more complete description of many synapses requires the binomial model, which explicitly considers the number of release sites ($n$) and their release probability ($p$).

Let $A$ denote the evoked EPSC amplitude measured on a single trial, and suppose that $A$ is measured over many identical trials to estimate its mean $E[A]$ and variance $\\mathrm{Var}[A]$.

It also requires the calculation of $n$ and $p$ from provided data and a discussion of the model's constraints.\n\nThe model assumes that a synapse has $n$ independent release sites. For a single presynaptic action potential, each site $i$ (for $i=1, 2, \\dots, n$) either releases a vesicle or it does not. We can model this with a Bernoulli random variable, $X_i$, for each site:\n$X_i = 1$ if a vesicle is released (with probability $p$).\n$X_i = 0$ if no vesicle is released (with probability $1-p$).\n\nThe total number of vesicles released in a single trial, let's call it $k$, is the sum of these independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli random variables:\n$$k = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$$\nSince $k$ is a sum of $n$ i.i.d.

We will use the fundamental properties of expectation and variance.\n\nFirst, let's find the expectation and variance of a single Bernoulli variable $X_i$:\nThe expectation is $E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot p + 0 \\cdot (1-p) = p$.\nThe variance is $\\mathrm{Var}[X_i] = E[X_i^2] - (E[X_i])^2$.\n$E[X_i^2] = 1^2 \\cdot p + 0^2 \\cdot (1-p) = p$.\nSo, $\\mathrm{Var}[X_i] = p - p^2 = p(1-p)$.\n\nNow we can find the expectation of the total amplitude $A$:\nUsing the linearity of expectation:\n$$E[A] = E[qk] = q E[k] = q E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right]$$\n$$E[A] = q \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_i] = q \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p = qnp$$\nThis gives our first equation:\n$$E[A] = qnp \\quad (1)$$\n\nNext, we find the variance of the total amplitude $A$. A key property of variance is that for a constant $c$ and random variable $X$, $\\mathrm{Var}[cX] = c^2 \\mathrm{Var}[X]$. Also, for independent random variables, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances.\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[A] = \\mathrm{Var}[qk] = q^2 \\mathrm{Var}[k] = q^2 \\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right]$$\nSince the $X_i$ are independent:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[A] = q^2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathrm{Var}[X_i] = q^2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p(1-p) = q^2 np(1-p)$$\nThis gives our second equation:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[A] = q^2 np(1-p) \\quad (2)$$\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $n$ and $p$. We can solve for them using the measurable quantities $E[A]$, $\\mathrm{Var}[A]$, and $q$.\nLet's rearrange equation $(2)$ by expanding the term $(1-p)$:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[A] = q^2 np - q^2 np^2$$\nNotice that the term $qnp$ is equal to $E[A]$ from equation $(1)$. Substituting this gives:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[A] = q(qnp) - q^2 np^2 = qE[A] - q^2 np^2$$\nWe also know $E[A]^2 = (qnp)^2 = q^2 n^2 p^2$. Let's try a different approach by dividing equation $(2)$ by equation $(1)$, assuming $E[A] \\neq 0$:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{Var}[A]}{E[A]} = \\frac{q^2 np(1-p)}{qnp} = q(1-p)$$\nFrom this ratio, we can solve for $p$:\n$$1-p = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}[A]}{qE[A]}$$\n$$p = 1 - \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}[A]}{qE[A]}$$\nThis is the desired expression for $p$.\n\nTo find $n$, we can substitute this expression for $p$ back into equation $(1)$:\n$$E[A] = qn\\left(1 - \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}[A]}{qE[A]}\\right)$$\nSolving for $n$:\n$$n = \\frac{E[A]}{q\\left(1 - \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}[A]}{qE[A]}\\right)} = \\frac{E[A]}{q - \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}[A]}{E[A]}}$$\nTo simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by $E[A]$:\n$$n = \\frac{(E[A])^2}{qE[A] - \\mathrm{Var}[A]}$$\nThis is the desired expression for $n$.\n\nNow we compute the numerical values for the provided data: $E[A] = 40$ pA, $\\mathrm{Var}[A] = 160$ pA$^2$, and $q = 8$ pA.\n$$p = 1 - \\frac{160}{8 \\cdot 40} = 1 - \\frac{160}{320} = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$$\n$$n = \\frac{(40)^2}{8 \\cdot 40 - 160} = \\frac{1600}{320 - 160} = \\frac{1600}{160} = 10$$\nSo, the release probability is $p=0.5$ and the number of release sites is $n=10$.\n\nFor a physically meaningful solution under this model, certain constraints on $E[A]$, $\\mathrm{Var}[A]$, and $q$ must hold:\n1.  The number of sites $n$ must be a positive integer, $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$. From its formula, this requires the denominator to be positive: $qE[A] - \\mathrm{Var}[A]  0$, which means $\\mathrm{Var}[A]  qE[A]$. It also requires the resulting value to be an integer.\n2.  The probability $p$ must be in the range $[0, 1]$.\n    -   $p \\ge 0$ implies $1 - \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}[A]}{qE[A]} \\ge 0$, which rearranges to $\\mathrm{Var}[A] \\le qE[A]$. This is consistent with the condition for $n$.\n    -   $p \\le 1$ implies $1 - \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}[A]}{qE[A]} \\le 1$, which means $-\\frac{\\mathrm{Var}[A]}{qE[A]} \\le 0$. Since variance, mean amplitude, and quantal size are non-negative, this condition is always met.\nTherefore, the primary constraint is $\\mathrm{Var}[A] \\le qE[A]$. We can see this from first principles: $\\mathrm{Var}[A] = q^2 np(1-p)$ and $E[A] = qnp$. The ratio $\\mathrm{Var}[A]/E[A] = q(1-p)$. Since $0 \\le p \\le 1$, we have $0 \\le 1-p \\le 1$, which implies $0 \\le \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}[A]}{E[A]} \\le q$, or $0 \\le \\mathrm{Var}[A] \\le qE[A]$.\n\nRegarding identifiability, the pair $(p, n)$ is uniquely determined by the derived formulas as long as the measured quantities $E[A]$, $\\mathrm{Var}[A]$, and $q$ satisfy the constraints. Specifically, a unique solution exists if $\\mathrm{Var}[A]  qE[A]$.\n- If $\\mathrm{Var}[A]  qE[A]$, the model yields a negative value for $p$, which is non-physical. This implies that the simple binomial model is not a correct description of the synaptic transmission (e.g., $q$ might not be constant, leading to additional variance).\n- If $\\mathrm{Var}[A] = qE[A]$, the formula for $p$ gives $p=0$. If $E[A]  0$, this is a contradiction, as $p=0$ implies $E[A]=0$. If $E[A]=0$ (and thus $\\mathrm{Var}[A]=0$), $n$ is indeterminate.\n- If $qE[A] - \\mathrm{Var}[A] = 0$ (so $\\mathrm{Var}[A] = qE[A]$) but with $E[A]0$, this implies from our formula that $p=1-1=0$, which is a contradiction. The only way variance can be zero in this model for a non-zero mean is if $p=1$, not $p=0$. If $p=1$, then $\\mathrm{Var}[A] = q^2n(1)(1-1) = 0$. In this case, $E[A] = qn$, so $n = E[A]/q$. The general formula for $n$ becomes undefined (division by zero), indicating a boundary case where one parameter ($p$) is fixed at its limit.\n- If the calculated value for $n$ is not an integer, it signifies that the experimental data (which contains measurement noise) do not perfectly fit the idealized model. In practice, researchers would assess if the result is close enough to an integer to be plausible or if the deviation suggests the model is inappropriate.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.5  10\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5055493"}, {"introduction": "The release probability, $p$, is not a static number but is dynamically regulated by biophysical factors, most importantly the concentration of presynaptic calcium, $[Ca^{2+}]$.
