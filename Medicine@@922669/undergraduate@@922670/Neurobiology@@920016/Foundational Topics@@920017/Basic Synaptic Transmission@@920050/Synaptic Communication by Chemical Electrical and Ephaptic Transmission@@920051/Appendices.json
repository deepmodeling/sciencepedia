I will first validate the problem statement and then proceed to the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n- **Experimental Setup**: A cortical slice preparation with parallel pyramidal neuron axons. Intracellular recording from neuron $N_2$. A precisely timed spike is evoked in neuron $N_1$ at time $t=0$. The local field potential (LFP) is measured at various distances $r$. The experiment is repeated to generate a latency distribution of the response in $N_2$. Pharmacological manipulations and changes to extracellular resistivity ($\\rho_e$) are performed.\n- **Goal**: Determine if the synchrony between $N_1$ and $N_2$ is most consistent with chemical synaptic transmission, electrical synapses (gap junctions), or ephaptic coupling.\n- **Fundamental Bases for Reasoning**:\n    - **(i) Chemical Synaptic Transmission**: Requires vesicle exocytosis triggered by presynaptic calcium entry, producing a synaptic delay and characteristic jitter.\n    - **(ii) Gap Junction Electrical Synapses**: Direct ohmic coupling with near-zero synaptic delay, insensitive to glutamatergic and GABA$_\\text{A}$ receptor antagonists, but reduced by gap junction blockers like carbenoxolone.\n    - **(iii) Ephaptic Coupling**: Arises from extracellular potentials. In a homogeneous volume conductor, potential decreases with distance, $|V(r)| \\propto 1/r$. Coupling strength scales with extracellular resistivity $\\rho_e$. Depends on neuron orientation relative to the field.\n    - **(iv) General Blocker**: Tetrodotoxin (TTX) blocks any spike-dependent coupling.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n- **Scientific Groundedness**: The problem is firmly grounded in established principles of neurophysiology. The three described mechanisms of neural communication (chemical, electrical, ephaptic) are well-documented. The pharmacological agents mentioned (CNQX, APV, bicuculline, carbenoxolone, TTX) and their mechanisms of action are standard knowledge in neuroscience. The experimental manipulation of extracellular resistivity ($\\rho_e$) via sucrose substitution for NaCl is a valid and common technique. The description of ephaptic coupling, including its dependence on $\\rho_e$, distance scaling ($1/r$), and orientation, is consistent with volume conductor theory and biophysical models. The fundamental bases provided are accurate summaries of these phenomena. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It asks to identify which set of experimental outcomes provides the strongest support for one of three competing hypotheses. This is a standard problem of scientific inference, solvable by comparing the expected characteristics of each mechanism with the described observations.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, free from subjective or biased claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective, with no identifiable flaws. I will now proceed to the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to identify the set of observations that most strongly supports ephaptic coupling as the dominant mechanism for synchrony between neurons $N_1$ and $N_2$. To do this, we will establish the expected \"fingerprint\" for each of the three coupling mechanisms based on the provided principles and then compare each option against the ephaptic fingerprint.\n\n**Expected Characteristics of Each Mechanism:**\n\n1.  **Chemical Synaptic Transmission (Principle i)**:\n    *   **Latency & Jitter**: Significant delay (typically $\\ge 1\\,\\mathrm{ms}$) due to vesicle release, diffusion, and receptor binding. High variability (jitter) in latency from trial to trial, often resulting in a skewed latency distribution.\n    *   **Pharmacology**: Sensitive to specific neurotransmitter receptor antagonists. For excitatory pyramidal neurons, this would be blockers of AMPA/kainate (e.g., CNQX) and NMDA (e.g., APV) receptors. Insensitive to gap junction blockers.\n    *   **Extracellular Resistivity ($\\rho_e$)**: The strength and timing of transmission are largely independent of bulk extracellular resistivity.\n    *   **Field Dependence**: Not directly dependent on the extracellular field's geometry or orientation in the manner of ephaptic coupling.\n\n2.  **Electrical Synapses / Gap Junctions (Principle ii)**:\n    *   **Latency & Jitter**: Near-zero delay (typically $< 0.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$) and very low jitter, reflecting direct ionic current flow.\n    *   **Pharmacology**: Insensitive to neurotransmitter receptor antagonists. Sensitive to gap junction blockers like carbenoxolone.\n    *   **Extracellular Resistivity ($\\rho_e$)**: Independent of extracellular resistivity, as the coupling is via a direct channel between cells.\n    *   **Field Dependence**: Not dependent on extracellular fields.\n\n3.  **Ephaptic Coupling (Principle iii)**:\n    *   **Latency & Jitter**: Near-zero delay and very low jitter. The effect is mediated by an electric field, which propagates nearly instantaneously over cellular distances.\n    *   **Pharmacology**: Insensitive to both neurotransmitter receptor antagonists and gap junction blockers. The coupling is a physical field effect, not dependent on molecular receptors or specific channels that are targets of these drugs.\n    *   **Extracellular Resistivity ($\\rho_e$)**: Coupling strength is directly proportional to $\\rho_e$. An increase in $\\rho_e$ (e.g., by replacing conductive ions with non-conductive sucrose) will amplify the extracellular potential for a given current source, thus strengthening the coupling. A decrease in $\\rho_e$ will weaken it.\n    *   **Field Dependence**: The effect is mediated by the extracellular field ($V_e$). Therefore, the response in the postsynaptic neuron ($N_2$) should scale with the local field strength (LFP). The LFP itself should decay with distance from the source, e.g., as $|V(r)| \\propto 1/r$. The coupling is also sensitive to the relative orientation of the neuronal compartments and the electric field vector.\n\nNow we evaluate each option against these criteria, looking for the best match for ephaptic coupling.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

This is inconsistent with ephaptic coupling, which should be insensitive to carbenoxolone.\n*   **Resistivity ($\\rho_e$)/Field**: Lack of dependence on $\\rho_e$ and the LFP are also inconsistent with ephaptic coupling.\n*   **Verdict**: This option describes a classic gap junction electrical synapse. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Latency distribution is near-zero delay with mean $0.2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ and standard deviation $0.04\\,\\mathrm{ms}$; the response persists in $10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ CNQX, $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ APV, and $10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ bicuculline, and is also unchanged by $100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ carbenoxolone; increasing $\\rho_e$ by approximately $50\\%$ via partial replacement of sodium chloride with sucrose increases the synchrony and response amplitude in $N_2$, whereas decreasing $\\rho_e$ reduces them; the simultaneously measured LFP amplitude scales approximately as $|V(r)| \\propto 1/r$ for $r$ between $20$ and $200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, and $N_2$’s depolarization magnitude scales with the local LFP and is maximal when the long axis of $N_2$’s axon initial segment is aligned parallel to the extracellular field.**\n\n*   **Latency/Jitter**: A mean of $0.2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ with a standard deviation of $0.04\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ is consistent with a direct field effect.\n*   **Pharmacology**: Insensitivity to both receptor antagonists (CNQX, APV, bicuculline) and the gap junction blocker (carbenoxolone) perfectly matches the expected profile for ephaptic coupling by ruling out the other two mechanisms.\n*   **Resistivity ($\\rho_e$)/Field**: The response amplitude scaling directly with $\\rho_e$ is a key and specific prediction for ephaptic coupling (Principle iii). The observation that the LFP decays as $1/r$ and that the response in $N_2$ scales with the local LFP and depends on orientation are also hallmarks of ephaptic coupling (Principle iii).\n*   **Verdict**: Every observation in this option aligns perfectly with the characteristic fingerprint of ephaptic coupling and provides evidence against the alternative mechanisms. This constitutes the strongest possible support. **Correct**.\n\n**D. Latency distribution is broad with mean $1.0\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ and standard deviation $0.7\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ and becomes tighter (standard deviation decreases to $0.2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$) when $\\rho_e$ is increased by $40\\%$; the response amplitude is reduced by $10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ CNQX and $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ APV by approximately $30\\%$ but not abolished, is unaffected by $100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ carbenoxolone, and the LFP amplitude decays as $1/r$ with distance, yet $N_2$’s response shows no consistent dependence on the angle between its axon initial segment and the field.**\n\n*   **Latency/Jitter**: The initial broad latency distribution (mean $1.0\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, std dev $0.7\\,\\mathrm{ms}$) points towards a chemical synaptic component.\n*   **Pharmacology**: The partial block by CNQX/APV confirms a chemical synaptic component. The resistance to carbenoxolone rules out gap junctions. The persistence of a response after the partial glutamatergic block suggests another mechanism is present.\n*   **Resistivity ($\\rho_e$)/Field**: That increasing $\\rho_e$ tightens the synchrony is consistent with an enhanced ephaptic component. However, the lack of dependence on the orientation of the neuron relative to the field explicitly contradicts a key feature of ephaptic coupling as stated in Principle (iii). This makes the evidence for ephaptic coupling ambiguous and weaker than in option C.\n*   **Verdict**: This option describes a mixed-mechanism synapse, likely a combination of chemical and ephaptic coupling. The broad latency and, most importantly, the lack of orientation dependence, argue against ephaptic coupling as the *dominant* and sole mechanism. Option C presents a much cleaner and stronger case. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption C is the only choice where all the described phenomena—very short and precise latency, insensitivity to all tested blockers, direct scaling with extracellular resistivity, and dependence on field geometry and orientation—collectively and unequivocally point to ephaptic coupling as the dominant mechanism of interaction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "5066408"}, {"introduction": "A hallmark of chemical synapses is that neurotransmitter release is a probabilistic, or stochastic, process.

This exercise delves into the foundational quantal theory of synaptic transmission, guiding you through the derivation and application of variance-mean analysis [@problem_id:5066455]. This powerful statistical tool allows researchers to dissect postsynaptic responses and estimate underlying presynaptic parameters like the number of release sites ($n$), the probability of release ($p$), and the size of the quantal response ($q$).", "problem": "A chemical synapse is voltage-clamped so that postsynaptic current fluctuations can be analyzed across trials of identical presynaptic stimulation. Assume there are $n$ independent release sites, each releasing at most one vesicle per stimulus with release probability $p$, and that each released vesicle produces an identical quantal current of amplitude $q$. Let $K$ denote the random number of vesicles released per trial, and let the postsynaptic current be $I = q K$. Assume linear superposition of quantal currents, identical $q$ across sites, and site independence, with negligible postsynaptic channel noise compared to release stochasticity.\n\nStarting from the definitions of the binomial distribution for $K$ and the linear relation $I = q K$, derive expressions for the mean $\\mu_I$ and variance $\\sigma_I^2$ of the postsynaptic current $I$ in terms of $n$, $p$, and $q$.\n\nAn experiment varies extracellular calcium to modulate $p$ and reports a variance–mean relation of the form $\\sigma_I^2 = - a \\, \\mu_I^2 + b \\, \\mu_I$ for the postsynaptic current, with $a = 0.02$ and $b = 8$, where $\\mu_I$ is in pA and $\\sigma_I^2$ is in pA$^2$.

The use of a binomial distribution to model neurotransmitter release is a standard, canonical model. The resulting parabolic relationship between variance and mean is a classic prediction of this model and a widely used tool for analyzing synaptic function (variance-mean analysis). The problem is self-contained, with all necessary parameters and relationships defined. The provided numerical values are physically plausible. The problem is well-posed and objective. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Derivation of Mean and Variance of Postsynaptic Current**\n\nLet $K$ be the random variable representing the number of vesicles released in a single trial. According to the problem statement, $K$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n$ (the number of independent release sites) and $p$ (the probability of release at any given site). We write this as $K \\sim B(n, p)$.\n\nThe mean (expected value) and variance of a binomial random variable are well-known results from probability theory:\n$$E[K] = np$$\n$$\\text{Var}(K) = np(1-p)$$\n\nThe postsynaptic current $I$ is given as a linear function of $K$: $I = qK$, where $q$ is the constant quantal current amplitude. We can find the mean of the current, $\\mu_I$, using the linearity property of the expectation operator, $E[cX] = cE[X]$ for a constant $c$.\n$$\\mu_I = E[I] = E[qK] = qE[K]$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E[K]$, we get:\n$$\\mu_I = qnp$$\n\nSimilarly, we can find the variance of the current, $\\sigma_I^2$, using the property of variance, $\\text{Var}(cX) = c^2\\text{Var}(X)$.\n$$\\sigma_I^2 = \\text{Var}(I) = \\text{Var}(qK) = q^2\\text{Var}(K)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\text{Var}(K)$, we get:\n$$\\sigma_I^2 = q^2np(1-p)$$\n\n**Explanation of Parameter Estimation**\n\nTo relate our derived expressions to the experimental variance-mean plot, we must express $\\sigma_I^2$ as a function of $\\mu_I$. We start with the derived variance:\n$$\\sigma_I^2 = q^2np(1-p) = q^2np - q^2np^2$$\nWe can recognize that the term $qnp$ is simply the mean current, $\\mu_I$.\n$$\\sigma_I^2 = q(qnp) - q^2np^2 = q\\mu_I - q^2np^2$$\nTo eliminate the explicit dependence on $p$ in the second term, we use the expression for the mean, $\\mu_I = qnp$, from which we can write $p = \\frac{\\mu_I}{qn}$. Substituting this into the second term:\n$$q^2np^2 = q^2n\\left(\\frac{\\mu_I}{qn}\\right)^2 = q^2n\\frac{\\mu_I^2}{q^2n^2} = \\frac{1}{n}\\mu_I^2$$\nTherefore, the theoretical relationship between variance and mean is:\n$$\\sigma_I^2 = q\\mu_I - \\frac{1}{n}\\mu_I^2$$\nThis is a parabolic function of $\\mu_I$, opening downwards.\n\nThe problem states that an experiment yields a variance-mean relation of the form $\\sigma_I^2 = -a \\mu_I^2 + b \\mu_I$, which we can write as $\\sigma_I^2 = b \\mu_I - a \\mu_I^2$ to match our derived form.\nBy comparing the coefficients of the theoretical and experimental equations:\nTheoretical: $\\sigma_I^2 = (q)\\mu_I - \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)\\mu_I^2$\nExperimental: $\\sigma_I^2 = (b)\\mu_I - (a)\\mu_I^2$\n\nWe can directly equate the coefficients:\n1.  The coefficient of the linear term gives the quantal size: $q = b$.\n2.  The coefficient of the quadratic term gives the number of release sites: $\\frac{1}{n} = a$, which implies $n = \\frac{1}{a}$.\n\nThus, by fitting a parabola to experimental variance-mean data points (obtained by varying $p$, for example, by changing extracellular calcium concentration), one can directly estimate the quantal size $q$ from the initial slope of the curve (at $\\mu_I=0$) or the linear coefficient $b$, and the number of release sites $n$ from the curvature or the quadratic coefficient $a$. Once $n$ and $q$ are known, the release probability $p$ for any specific condition that produced a mean current $\\mu_I$ can be calculated from the formula $p = \\frac{\\mu_I}{qn}$.\n\n**Calculation of Predicted Variance**\n\nWe are given the experimental relationship $\\sigma_I^2 = - a \\, \\mu_I^2 + b \\, \\mu_I$ with coefficients $a = 0.02$ (dimensionless) and $b = 8$ (in units of pA). We need to calculate the variance $\\sigma_I^2$ for a mean current of $\\mu_I = 40$ pA.\nWe substitute the given values into the equation:\n$$\\sigma_I^2 = -0.02 \\times (40)^2 + 8 \\times 40$$\n$$\\sigma_I^2 = -0.02 \\times 1600 + 320$$\n$$\\sigma_I^2 = -32 + 320$$\n$$\\sigma_I^2 = 288$$\nThe units of variance are pA$^2$, as expected. The value $288$ has three significant figures.\n\n**Comparison with Other Transmission Modalities**\n\nThe variance-mean analysis described is a hallmark of chemical synapses because the source of variability it models—the probabilistic, quantal release of neurotransmitter—is fundamental to their operation.\n\n-   **Chemical Synapse**: Transmission relies on the stochastic release of a discrete number (quanta) of vesicles from a finite pool of ready-to-release sites. The dominant source of trial-to-trial variability is the randomness of release, which is well-described by binomial (or Poisson, in the limit of low $p$ and large $n$) statistics. This leads directly to the characteristic parabolic variance-mean relationship, which provides a powerful tool to dissect the underlying presynaptic parameters ($n, p, q$).\n\n-   **Electrical Synapse (Gap Junction)**: Transmission occurs via the direct passage of ions between cells through gap junction channels. These channels are proteins (connexons) that can be in open or closed states. While the gating of each individual channel is a stochastic process, an electrical synapse typically comprises hundreds to thousands of such channels. The signal is not \"quantal\" in the sense of a vesicle. The primary sources of noise are the stochastic gating of these many channels and thermal noise. The total conductance is the sum of many small, independent channel conductances. The statistics are fundamentally different from vesicular release from a small number of sites. The variance-mean relationship would not generally follow the simple parabola derived for chemical synapses, as the \"quantum\" is a single channel's conductance, which is very small, and the number of \"sites\" (channels) is very large. Transmission is more graded and typically much less variable than at a chemical synapse with comparable mean current.\n\n-   **Ephaptic Interaction**: This form of communication is non-synaptic and occurs when the electric field generated by one neuron affects the membrane potential of a nearby neuron. The source of the \"signal\" and its \"noise\" is the collective, spatio-temporally integrated activity of a population of neurons in the extracellular space. This process does not involve discrete, independent quantal events from a fixed number of sites. The statistics are governed by population dynamics, neuronal geometry, and tissue properties. A binomial model is entirely inappropriate. The resulting fluctuations would have statistical properties reflecting summed population activity, which, under certain conditions (e.g., many independent contributing neurons), might be approximated by a Gaussian distribution via the central limit theorem, but it would not exhibit the specific parabolic variance-mean profile tied to quantal release.\n\nIn summary, the variance-mean analysis is tailored to the specific statistical nature of stochastic, quantal release that defines chemical neurotransmission and is not directly applicable to the physically and statistically distinct mechanisms of electrical and ephaptic communication.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{288}$$", "id": "5066455"}, {"introduction": "Synapses are not static entities; their efficacy changes dynamically based on the history of their recent activity.

The synaptic efficacy at the moment immediately before each spike is determined by two state variables: the fraction of available resources $R$ and the utilization of synaptic efficacy $u$. Assume the following fundamental bases that are standard for resource-based synaptic models of chemical transmission:\n\n- Conservation of synaptic resources: upon a spike, a fraction $u$ of the available resources $R$ is released, instantaneously decreasing $R$ by the released amount, and evoked postsynaptic response amplitude is proportional to $u R$.\n- First-order kinetics for between-spike relaxation: between spikes, $R$ recovers exponentially toward $1$ with a time constant $\\tau_d$ seconds, and $u$ relaxes exponentially toward a baseline $U$ with a facilitation time constant $\\tau_f$ seconds.\n- At each spike, $u$ instantaneously increases by a fraction of its remaining difference to $1$ proportional to a baseline parameter $U$.\n\nStarting from these bases, and denoting pre-spike values by $R_n^-$ and $u_n^-$, post-spike values by $R_n^+$ and $u_n^+$, and the interspike interval by $T$, perform the following tasks:\n\n1.

Express the evoked postsynaptic response amplitude on spike $n$ as $A_n$ in terms of $R_n^-$ and $u_n^-$. Use the initial conditions $R_0^- = 1$ and $u_0^- = U$.\n2. For strictly periodic stimulation with fixed $T$, derive the steady-state pre-spike values $\\hat{u}$ and $\\hat{R}$ that satisfy the fixed-point conditions implied by the discrete dynamics. Express the steady-state amplitude $\\hat{A}$ in terms of $\\hat{u}$ and $\\hat{R}$.\n3. Implement the derived relations to compute, for each specified parameter set, the steady-state amplitude $\\hat{A}$ and the transient amplitudes $A_1$, $A_{10}$, and $A_{50}$ from the initial conditions stated above.\n\nPhysical and numerical units and output requirements:\n- Time constants $\\tau_d$ and $\\tau_f$ must be given in seconds.\n- Frequency $f$ must be given in Hertz, with $T = 1/f$ in seconds.\n- The baseline utilization $U$ is dimensionless and must satisfy $0 \\le U \\le 1$.\n- The amplitudes $A_n$ and $\\hat{A}$ are dimensionless.\n- Report all amplitudes rounded to $6$ decimal places.\n\nTest suite:\nFor each of the following parameter sets $(U,\\tau_f,\\tau_d,f)$, compute $\\hat{A}$, $A_1$, $A_{10}$, and $A_{50}$.\n\n- Case $1$: $U = 0.2$, $\\tau_f = 0.5$ seconds, $\\tau_d = 0.8$ seconds, $f = 10$ Hertz.\n- Case $2$: $U = 0.5$, $\\tau_f = 1.0$ seconds, $\\tau_d = 1.0$ seconds, $f = 1$ Hertz.\n- Case $3$: $U = 0.1$, $\\tau_f = 0.3$ seconds, $\\tau_d = 0.2$ seconds, $f = 100$ Hertz.\n- Case $4$: $U = 0.9$, $\\tau_f = 0.1$ seconds, $\\tau_d = 0.5$ seconds, $f = 20$ Hertz.\n\nFinal output format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. For each case, output the list $[\\hat{A}, A_1, A_{10}, A_{50}]$ rounded to $6$ decimal places. Aggregate the $4$ case results into a single top-level list, for example, $[[\\hat{A}_1,A_{1,1},A_{10,1},A_{50,1}],[\\hat{A}_2,A_{1,2},A_{10,2},A_{50,2}],\\dots]$.", "solution": "We begin with the chemical synapse resource model underlying the Tsodyks–Markram (TM) framework. The model captures two processes: depression due to depletion of readily releasable resources and facilitation due to increased utilization with repetitive stimulation.\n\nFundamental bases:\n\n- Resource release and conservation: at the moment of a presynaptic spike $n$, an amount proportional to $u_n^- R_n^-$ is released, so the instantaneous post-spike resource becomes $R_n^+ = R_n^- (1 - u_n^-)$. The evoked amplitude is proportional to the released fraction, so we take $A_n = u_n^- R_n^-$ as the dimensionless postsynaptic response.\n- Between spikes, the resource recovers to full availability $R = 1$ through first-order kinetics: $\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\frac{1 - R}{\\tau_d}$, where $\\tau_d$ is the recovery time constant (seconds).\n- Utilization $u$ is increased by the spike due to facilitation and relaxes between spikes toward a baseline $U$ with time constant $\\tau_f$ (seconds). A standard TM assumption for spike-driven facilitation is that upon a spike, $u$ increments by a fraction of the remaining headroom to $1$ proportional to $U$, yielding $u_n^+ = u_n^- + U (1 - u_n^-)$.\n\nBetween spikes, $u$ relaxes toward $U$ via first-order kinetics: $\\frac{du}{dt} = -\\frac{u - U}{\\tau_f}$.\n\nDiscretization across a periodic spike train:\n\n- Let $T$ be the interspike interval in seconds. Solving the linear ordinary differential equations between spikes gives exponential relaxations:\n  - For $R$: $R_{n+1}^- = 1 - (1 - R_n^+) e^{-T / \\tau_d}$, because $R$ approaches $1$ with time constant $\\tau_d$ from initial value $R_n^+$.\n  - For $u$: $u_{n+1}^- = U + (u_n^+ - U) e^{-T / \\tau_f}$, because $u$ approaches $U$ with time constant $\\tau_f$ from initial value $u_n^+$.\n\nCombining spike and interspike mappings:\n- Spike $n$:\n  - $A_n = u_n^- R_n^-$.\n  - $u_n^+ = u_n^- + U (1 - u_n^-)$.\n  - $R_n^+ = R_n^- (1 - u_n^-)$.\n- Interspike to spike $n+1$:\n  - $u_{n+1}^- = U + (u_n^+ - U) e^{-T / \\tau_f}$.\n  - $R_{n+1}^- = 1 - (1 - R_n^+) e^{-T / \\tau_d}$.\n\nInitial conditions:\n- $R_0^- = 1$, meaning all resources are initially available.\n- $u_0^- = U$, meaning utilization is at its baseline before the first spike.\n\nSteady-state under periodic stimulation:\nAt steady-state, pre-spike values become period-invariant: $u_{n+1}^- = u_n^- = \\hat{u}$ and $R_{n+1}^- = R_n^- = \\hat{R}$. Using the above relations, solve for $\\hat{u}$ and $\\hat{R}$:\n\n- For $\\hat{u}$:\n  The interspike update with the spike facilitation yields\n  $$\\hat{u} = U + (\\hat{u} + U (1 - \\hat{u}) - U) e^{-T / \\tau_f} = U + \\hat{u} (1 - U) e^{-T / \\tau_f}.$$\n  Rearranging,\n  $$\\hat{u} \\left[ 1 - (1 - U) e^{-T / \\tau_f} \\right] = U,$$\n  hence\n  $$\\hat{u} = \\frac{U}{1 - (1 - U) e^{-T / \\tau_f}}.$$\n\n- For $\\hat{R}$:\n  Using $R^+ = R^- (1 - u^-)$ and the interspike relaxation,\n  $$\\hat{R} = 1 - \\left(1 - \\hat{R} (1 - \\hat{u})\\right) e^{-T / \\tau_d}.$$\n  Rearranging,\n  $$\\hat{R} \\left[ 1 - (1 - \\hat{u}) e^{-T / \\tau_d} \\right] = 1 - e^{-T / \\tau_d},$$\n  hence\n  $$\\hat{R} = \\frac{1 - e^{-T / \\tau_d}}{1 - (1 - \\hat{u}) e^{-T / \\tau_d}}.$$\n\nThe steady-state amplitude is\n$$\\hat{A} = \\hat{u} \\, \\hat{R}.$$\n\nAlgorithmic design:\n- Inputs per case: $(U, \\tau_f, \\tau_d, f)$, with $T = 1 / f$ in seconds.\n- Compute $e_f = e^{-T / \\tau_f}$ and $e_d = e^{-T / \\tau_d}$.\n- Compute $\\hat{u}$ via $\\hat{u} = \\frac{U}{1 - (1 - U) e_f}$.\n- Compute $\\hat{R}$ via $\\hat{R} = \\frac{1 - e_d}{1 - (1 - \\hat{u}) e_d}$.\n- Compute $\\hat{A} = \\hat{u} \\hat{R}$.\n- For transients, iterate from $R_0^- = 1$ and $u_0^- = U$ for $N = 50$ spikes:\n  - For each spike $n$ from $1$ to $N$, compute $A_n = u_n^- R_n^-$.\n  - Update to $u_n^+$ and $R_n^+$ via the spike relations.\n  - Relax to $u_{n+1}^-$ and $R_{n+1}^-$ via the interspike relations.\n- Extract $A_1$, $A_{10}$, and $A_{50}$ (with $N = 50$ ensuring availability of these indices).\n- Round each amplitude to $6$ decimal places and format as specified.\n\nScientific realism:\n- Parameters are within established physiological ranges for chemical synapses.\n- The derivation relies entirely on conservation of resources, first-order relaxation, and spike-driven facilitation consistent with the Tsodyks–Markram model structure.\n- Periodic stimulation allows fixed-point analysis and transient simulation without requiring untested or ad hoc formulas.\n\nThe program will apply this method to the four specified cases and print a single line containing a top-level list of four sublists, each sublist being $[\\hat{A}, A_1, A_{10}, A_{50}]$, all in dimensionless units and rounded to $6$ decimal places.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef steady_state_amplitudes(U, tau_f, tau_d, f):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute steady-state pre-spike values u_hat and R_hat and amplitude A_hat\n    for the Tsodyks–Markram model under periodic stimulation.\n    \n    Parameters:\n        U (float): Baseline utilization (dimensionless, 0 = U = 1)\n        tau_f (float): Facilitation time constant (seconds)\n        tau_d (float): Recovery (depression) time constant (seconds)\n        f (float): Stimulation frequency (Hertz)\n        \n    Returns:\n        (u_hat, R_hat, A_hat): Tuple of floats (dimensionless)\n    \"\"\"\n    T = 1.0 / f\n    # Avoid numerical issues for extremely small time constants by clamping exponent arguments\n    ef = np.exp(-T / tau_f) if tau_f > 0 else 0.0  # if tau_f == 0, instantaneous to U -> ef = 0\n    ed = np.exp(-T / tau_d) if tau_d > 0 else 0.0  # if tau_d == 0, instantaneous to 1 -> ed = 0\n\n    denom_u = 1.0 -
