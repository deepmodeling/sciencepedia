At the bundle’s ionic center, the conserved $0$-layer comprises three glutamines ($Q$) from the target SNAREs and one arginine ($R$) from the vesicle SNARE. Exocytosis requires progressive “zippering” of the SNARE helices from the membrane-distal N-termini toward the membrane-proximal C-termini, and the work released by this assembly helps lower the free-energy barrier for bilayer fusion. Consider a mutation that replaces the $0$-layer $R$ of $\\text{VAMP2}$ with $Q$, yielding an all-$Q$ $0$-layer. Using first principles about electrostatics (opposite charges attract according to Coulomb’s law), hydrogen bonding (directionality and sensitivity to solvation), and thermally activated barrier crossing ($p_{\\text{fusion}} \\propto \\exp[-\\Delta G^\\ddagger/(k_B T)]$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is temperature), choose the option that best describes how this mutation is expected to change the local bundle geometry and hydrogen-bonding network at the $0$-layer, and the qualitative impact on fusion probability at a fixed intracellular calcium concentration.\n\nA. Replacing $R$ with $Q$ removes the central positive charge, dismantling the salt-bridge-like cross-brace and increasing local hydration and interhelical spacing.

The conserved ionic $0$-layer with its R-Q-Q-Q composition is a cornerstone of SNARE function literature (e.g., Fasshauer et al., 1998, Sutton et al., 1998). The relationship between fusion probability and the free energy barrier is a standard concept from transition state theory (Arrhenius-like equation). The proposed mutation ($R \\to Q$ in VAMP2) is a standard tool in molecular biology to probe function. The principles to be used (electrostatics, H-bonding) are fundamental. The problem is scientifically sound.\n        *   **Well-Posed:** The problem asks for the qualitative effect of a specific mutation based on first principles.

The scenario is realistic.\n            5.  **Ill-Posed/Ambiguous:** No. The terms are standard in the field. The question is clear.\n            6.  **Pseudo-Profound/Trivial:** No. This requires understanding the interplay of several biophysical principles. The structure of the RQQQ layer is non-trivial.

I will proceed to the solution phase.\n\n3.  **Solution Derivation:**\n    *   **Analyze the Wild-Type (WT) 0-layer (RQQQ):**\n        *   The $0$-layer is so-named because it's at the center of the layered structure of side chains in the SNARE bundle.\n        *   It contains one Arginine ($R$) from VAMP2 and three Glutamines ($Q$) (one from Syntaxin-$1$, two from SNAP-$25$).\n        *   Arginine has a bulky, positively charged guanidinium group at physiological pH.\n        *   Glutamine has a polar, uncharged amide side chain.\n        *   Inside the hydrophobic core of a protein bundle, a charge is highly unfavorable unless it is neutralized.\n        *   The central positive charge of the arginine ($R$) is stabilized by electrostatic interactions with the partial negative charges on the oxygen atoms of the three glutamine ($Q$) side-chain amides. This is often described as a salt-bridge-like interaction network or an ionic-hydrogen bond network. The $R$ guanidinium group can act as a hydrogen bond donor, and the $Q$ amide carbonyls can act as acceptors.\n        *   This strong, specific interaction acts as a \"cross-brace,\" pulling the four helices tightly together at this central point.\n        *   This tight packing excludes water molecules. The environment is highly dehydrated. The strength of electrostatic interactions is inversely proportional to the dielectric constant of the medium. In a low-dielectric (hydrophobic) environment like the protein core, these ionic interactions are very strong.\n        *   The energy released during the formation of this highly stable RQQQ layer contributes significantly to the total \"zippering energy\" that drives membrane fusion.\n\n    *   **Analyze the Mutant 0-layer (QQQQ):**\n        *   The mutation is $R \\to Q$. The layer is now composed of four glutamines.\n        *   Glutamine ($Q$) is polar but uncharged. It is also smaller than Arginine ($R$).\n        *   **Electrostatics:** The central positive charge provided by R is now gone. The repulsive forces between the partial positive charges on the amide hydrogens and the repulsive forces between the partial negative charges on the carbonyl oxygens of the four $Q$ side chains are no longer counteracted by a central positive charge. In fact, these like-charge and like-dipole repulsions will now dominate. The four identical, polar side chains will repel each other.\n        *   **Bundle Geometry:** This electrostatic repulsion will push the helices apart. The tight packing of the WT core will be lost. The interhelical spacing at the $0$-layer will increase.\n        *   **Hydration/Solvation:** The increased spacing creates a void or a less tightly packed region. This space will likely become filled with water molecules from the surrounding solvent. The hydrophilic amide groups of the glutamines will favor interaction with water over interacting with each other in a repulsive configuration. Increased hydration of the core is a key consequence.\n        *   **Hydrogen Bonding:** While Q-Q (amide-amide) hydrogen bonds can form, they are weaker than the strong, focused ionic-hydrogen bonds of the R-Q network, especially in a hydrated environment. The repulsion and increased spacing make the formation of a stable, ordered H-bond network among the four Qs less favorable. Any H-bonds formed will be more exposed to solvent (water), which weakens them (water competes as an H-bond partner). The geometry might be frustrated.\n        *   **Zippering Energy and Fusion Barrier ($\\Delta G^\\ddagger$):** The formation of the stable RQQQ layer in the WT complex releases a significant amount of free energy. This energy is a crucial part of the work done during zippering. In the QQQQ mutant, the formation of the $0$-layer is now energetically unfavorable or much less favorable due to electrostatic repulsion and the loss of the strong R-Q interactions. The zippering process is therefore \"stalled\" or less energetically driven as it approaches the $0$-layer. The total work released by SNARE assembly is reduced. The energy landscape for fusion is altered. Since the SNARE zippering energy helps to lower the activation energy barrier for membrane fusion ($\\Delta G^\\ddagger$), a reduction in this zippering energy means that the effective barrier, $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$, will be higher.\n        *   **Fusion Probability ($p_{\\text{fusion}}$):** The problem states $p_{\\text{fusion}} \\propto \\exp[-\\Delta G^\\ddagger/(k_B T)]$. If $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ increases, the term in the exponent becomes more negative. This means the exponential term, and thus $p_{\\text{fusion}}$, will decrease significantly.\n\n    *   **Conclusion Summary:** The $R \\to Q$ mutation replaces the central positive charge with a neutral polar group, leading to electrostatic repulsion between the four glutamines. This disrupts the tight packing, increases interhelical distance, and allows water to enter the core. The original strong ionic-hydrogen bond network is replaced by a weaker, less organized, and solvent-exposed network. This reduces the energy released during zippering, thereby increasing the free energy barrier for fusion ($\\Delta G^\\ddagger$) and decreasing the probability of fusion ($p_{\\text{fusion}}$).\n\n4.  **Option-by-Option Analysis:**\n    *   **Option A:** \"Replacing $R$ with $Q$ removes the central positive charge, dismantling the salt-bridge-like cross-brace and increasing local hydration and interhelical spacing. The all-$Q$ core can form amide–amide hydrogen bonds that are weaker and more solvent-exposed than the original mixed ionic–hydrogen-bond network.

Less energy is released, so the barrier is not lowered as much, meaning the effective barrier is higher.\n        *   `so $p_{\\text{fusion}}$ decreases`: Correct.

The R-Q interaction is uniquely strong. Replacing it with Q-Q repulsion will not increase H-bond strength or tighten packing. It will do the opposite.

Glutamine's side chain is polar but overall neutral. It has a carbonyl oxygen ($\\delta^-$) and an amide nitrogen/hydrogens ($\\delta^+$), but no net charge.\n        *   `strengthening electrostatic attraction to surrounding Q residues`: Incorrect. Even if it were negative, it would repel the partial negative charges on the oxygen atoms of the other glutamines. The argument is flawed.

It describes a simplified but valid biophysical model of synaptic vesicle priming by the protein Munc13. The provided parameters and conditions are sufficient and consistent for deriving a unique and meaningful solution. Thus, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is derived from the two fundamental assumptions provided.\n\nFirst, the fraction of priming sites occupied by Munc13, denoted as $f$, is described by a single-site binding equilibrium. This is mathematically represented by the Hill-Langmuir equation for a single binding site. Let $[ \\text{Munc13} ]$ be the effective free concentration of Munc13 and $K_{M}$ be its dissociation constant for the priming sites. The fraction of occupied sites is given by:\n$$f = \\frac{[ \\text{Munc13} ]}{[ \\text{Munc13} ] + K_{M}}$$\nThis equation describes the fraction of sites that are \"primed\" and ready to contribute to the readily releasable pool (RRP).\n\nSecond, the size of the readily releasable pool ($RRP$) scales linearly with this fraction of primed sites. The maximum pool size, $R_{\\max}$, is achieved when all sites are occupied, which corresponds to $f=1$. Therefore, the relationship between $RRP$ and $f$ is:\n$$RRP = R_{\\max} \\cdot f$$\nSubstituting the expression for $f$ into this equation, we derive the dependence of the $RRP$ on the Munc13 concentration:\n$$RRP([ \\text{Munc13} ]) = R_{\\max} \\frac{[ \\text{Munc13} ]}{[ \\text{Munc13} ] + K_{M}}$$\nThis fulfills the first part of the task, which is to derive the dependence of the RRP on $[ \\text{Munc13} ]$.\n\nNext, we compute the baseline $RRP$, denoted as $RRP_0$, using the given initial conditions. The problem provides:\n- Maximum pool size, $R_{\\max} = 20$ vesicles per active zone.\n- Dissociation constant, $K_{M} = 5$ arbitrary units.\n- Baseline Munc13 concentration, $[ \\text{Munc13} ]_{0} = 3$ arbitrary units.\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived equation:\n$$RRP_0 = R_{\\max} \\frac{[ \\text{Munc13} ]_{0}}{[ \\text{Munc13} ]_{0} + K_{M}} = 20 \\frac{3}{3 + 5} = 20 \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{60}{8} = 7.5$$\nSo, the baseline readily releasable pool consists of $7.5$ vesicles.\n\nThe problem then describes a manipulation where Munc13 expression is doubled.

With $N_{\\text{NSF}}$ hexamers working in parallel, the total disassembly rate is:\n$$ R_{\\text disass} = N_{\\text{NSF}} \\times f_{\\text{NSF}} \\times 1 = N_{\\text{NSF}} \\times f_{\\text{NSF}} $$\n\nAt steady state, $R_{\\text{form}} = R_{\\text{disass}}$.\n$$ r_{\\text{fuse}} \\times c = N_{\\text{NSF}} \\times f_{\\text{NSF}} $$\nThis equation allows us to express the unknown $N_{\\text{NSF}}$ in terms of given parameters:\n$$ N_{\\text{NSF}} = \\frac{r_{\\text{fuse}} \\times c}{f_{\\text{NSF}}} $$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $N_{\\text{NSF}}$ back into the equation for the total ATP hydrolysis rate $R_{\\text{ATP}}$:\n$$ R_{\\text{ATP}} = \\left( \\frac{r_{\\text{fuse}} \\times c}{f_{\\text{NSF}}} \\right) \\times f_{\\text{NSF}} \\times k_{\\text{ATP}} $$\nThe NSF turnover frequency, $f_{\\text{NSF}}$, cancels out:\n$$ R_{\\text{ATP}} = r_{\\text{fuse}} \\times c \\times k_{\\text{ATP}} $$\n\nFinally, we can compute the desired quantity, $N_{\\text{ATP/fuse}}$, by substituting this expression for $R_{\\text{ATP}}$ into our initial ratio:\n$$ N_{\\text{ATP/fuse}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{ATP}}}{r_{\\text{fuse}}} = \\frac{r_{\\text{fuse}} \\times c \\times k_{\\text{ATP}}}{r_{\\text{fuse}}} $$\nThe vesicle fusion rate, $r_{\\text{fuse}}$, also cancels out. This yields a remarkably simple result:\n$$ N_{\\text{ATP/fuse}} = c \\times k_{\\text{ATP}} $$\nThis result is intuitively correct. In a steady state, every cis-SNARE complex that is formed must eventually be disassembled. Therefore, the average ATP cost per fusion event is simply the number of complexes created per event ($c$) multiplied by the fixed ATP cost to disassemble each of those complexes ($k_{\\text{ATP}}$). The kinetic parameters $r_{\\text{fuse}}$ and $f_{\\text{NSF}}$ are necessary to establish that a steady state is possible and to bridge the logic, but they are not needed for the final calculation of the ATP-to-fusion ratio.\n\nUsing the given numerical values:\n$c = 3.2$ complexes per fusion event.\n$k_{\\text{ATP}} = 6$ ATP molecules per complex disassembly.\n\n$$ N_{\\text{ATP/fuse}} = 3.2 \\times 6 = 19.2 $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed to four significant figures.\n$$ N_{\\text{ATP/fuse}} = 19.20 $$\nThis is the number of ATP molecules hydrolyzed per fusion event.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{19.20}\n$$", "id": "5076160"}]}
