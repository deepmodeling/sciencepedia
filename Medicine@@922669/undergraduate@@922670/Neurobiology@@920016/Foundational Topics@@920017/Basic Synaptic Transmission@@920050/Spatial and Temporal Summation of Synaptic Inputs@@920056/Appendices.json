It is based on the fundamental principles of passive membrane electrophysiology and provides sufficient information for a unique solution. We shall proceed.\n\nThe neuron is modeled as a single isopotential compartment, which can be represented as a parallel resistor-capacitor ($RC$) circuit. The membrane potential, $V_m(t)$, relative to the resting potential, is governed by the first-order linear differential equation:\n$$I_{inj}(t) = I_R(t) + I_C(t)$$\nwhere $I_{inj}(t)$ is the injected current, $I_R(t)$ is the ionic current flowing through the membrane resistance, and $I_C(t)$ is the capacitive current.\n\nThe currents are defined as:\n$$I_R(t) = \\frac{V_m(t)}{R_{total}}$$\n$$I_C(t) = C_{total} \\frac{dV_m(t)}{dt}$$\nHere, $R_{total}$ and $C_{total}$ are the total membrane resistance and capacitance of the soma, respectively.

Derivation and Computation of the Membrane Time Constant $\\tau_m$**\n\nThe membrane time constant, $\\tau_m$, is defined by the product of the total resistance and total capacitance:\n$$\\tau_m = R_{total}C_{total}$$\nThe problem provides the specific membrane resistance $R_m$ (in units of resistance $\\times$ area) and the specific membrane capacitance $C_m$ (in units of capacitance / area). These are related to the total properties through the surface area of the soma, $A$.\nThe soma is a sphere with diameter $d = 20\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.
