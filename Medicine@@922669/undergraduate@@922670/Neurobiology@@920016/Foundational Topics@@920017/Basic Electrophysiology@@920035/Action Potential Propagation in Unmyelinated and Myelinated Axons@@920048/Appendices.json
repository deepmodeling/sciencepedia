It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective problem in the field of neurobiology, suitable for a quantitative solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the electrotonic length constant, $\\lambda$, and the membrane time constant, $\\tau$, for a passive cylindrical axon, followed by their numerical evaluation and a physiological interpretation.\n\nFirst, we must express the resistance and capacitance per unit length of the axon in terms of the given specific parameters. The axon is modeled as a cylinder of radius $a$.\n\nThe axial resistance per unit length, $r_a$, depends on the intracellular resistivity, $r_i$, and the cross-sectional area of the cytoplasm, $A = \\pi a^2$. The resistance of a conductor is given by resistivity times length divided by area. For a unit length ($L=1$), this becomes:\n$$r_a = \\frac{r_i}{\\pi a^2}$$\nThe units are resistance per length, for instance, $\\mathrm{\\Omega/cm}$.\n\nThe membrane resistance per unit length, $r_m$, depends on the specific membrane resistance, $R_m$ (units of $\\mathrm{\\Omega \\cdot cm^2}$), and the membrane surface area per unit length, which is the circumference of the cylinder, $2\\pi a$. The specific resistance $R_m$ is the resistance of a unit area of the membrane. To find the resistance for a strip of membrane of unit length, we divide $R_m$ by the circumference:\n$$r_m = \\frac{R_m}{2\\pi a}$$\nThe units are resistance times length, for instance, $\\mathrm{\\Omega \\cdot cm}$.\n\nThe membrane capacitance per unit length, $c_m$, depends on the specific membrane capacitance, $C_m$ (units of $\\mathrm{F/cm^2}$), and the circumference, $2\\pi a$. The specific capacitance $C_m$ is the capacitance of a unit area of membrane. To find the capacitance of a strip of membrane of unit length, we multiply $C_m$ by the circumference:\n$$c_m = C_m \\cdot 2\\pi a$$\nThe units are capacitance per length, for instance, $\\mathrm{F/cm}$.\n\nAccording to standard passive cable theory, the electrotonic length constant, $\\lambda$, is defined as:\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_m}{r_a}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $r_m$ and $r_a$:\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m / (2\\pi a)}{r_i / (\\pi a^2)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m}{2\\pi a} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi a^2}{r_i}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m a}{2 r_i}}$$\nThis is the required expression for $\\lambda$ in terms of the given parameters.\n\nThe membrane time constant, $\\tau$, is defined as the product of the membrane resistance and capacitance. For the parameters per unit length, this is:\n$$\\tau = r_m c_m$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $r_m$ and $c_m$:\n$$\\tau = \\left(\\frac{R_m}{2\\pi a}\\right) (C_m \\cdot 2\\pi a) = R_m C_m$$\nThis is the required expression for $\\tau$. Note that $\\tau$ is independent of the axon's geometry ($a$) and depends only on the intrinsic properties of the membrane itself.\n\nNext, we evaluate these quantities using the provided numerical values. We must first ensure all units are consistent. We will use the cgs system (centimeter, gram, second) as a base, with electrical units of Volts, Amperes, Ohms, and Farads.\n\nGiven values:\n$a = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n$R_m = 1\\,\\mathrm{k\\Omega\\,cm^2} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\,cm^2}$\n$C_m = 1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu F/cm^2} = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F/cm^2}$\n$r_i = 100\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\,cm}$\n\nCalculation of $\\tau$:\n$$\\tau = R_m C_m = (1000\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\,cm^2}) \\cdot (1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F/cm^2}) = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega \\cdot F}$$\nSince the time constant of an RC circuit is $\\tau = RC$, the unit $\\mathrm{\\Omega \\cdot F}$ is equivalent to seconds ($\\mathrm{s}$).\n$$\\tau = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 1\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\nTo three significant figures, this is $1.00\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nCalculation of $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m a}{2 r_i}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(1000\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\,cm^2}) \\cdot (0.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{cm})}{2 \\cdot (100\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\,cm})}}$$\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{500 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\,cm^3}}{200\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\,cm}}} = \\sqrt{2.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2}} = \\sqrt{2.5} \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\\sqrt{2.5} \\approx 1.5811388...$$\n$$\\lambda \\approx 1.5811 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 0.015811\\,\\mathrm{cm}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}$).

It is a measure of how effectively a passive electrical signal propagates along the axon before it attenuates. A larger $\\lambda$ indicates that voltage spreads farther, facilitating the spatial summation of synaptic potentials and increasing the speed of action potential propagation in myelinated axons.\n\nThe membrane time constant, $\\tau$, characterizes the speed at which the membrane potential changes in response to an input current. It is the time required for the membrane potential to reach $(1 - 1/e)$ (approximately $63.2\\%$) of its final steady-state value after a step change in current. A shorter $\\tau$ allows for a faster response to stimuli and supports higher frequencies of action potential firing, while a longer $\\tau$ promotes the temporal summation of slow or repeated inputs.\n\nQualitative effects of changing parameters:\n- Increasing axon radius $a$: $\\lambda \\propto \\sqrt{a}$, so $\\lambda$ increases. $\\tau$ is independent of $a$. Larger axons have better passive current spread.\n- Increasing specific membrane resistance $R_m$: $\\lambda \\propto \\sqrt{R_m}$ and $\\tau \\propto R_m$. Both constants increase. A less \"leaky\" membrane improves voltage spread but slows the membrane's response time.\n- Increasing specific membrane capacitance $C_m$: $\\lambda$ is independent of $C_m$. $\\tau \\propto C_m$, so $\\tau$ increases. A higher capacitance means more charge must be moved to change the voltage, slowing the membrane's response.\n- Increasing intracellular resistivity $r_i$: $\\lambda \\propto 1/\\sqrt{r_i}$, so $\\lambda$ decreases. $\\tau$ is independent of $r_i$. A more resistive cytoplasm hinders current flow along the axon.\n\nMyelination involves wrapping the axon with insulating myelin sheaths. This process drastically increases the effective specific membrane resistance $R_m$ and decreases the effective specific membrane capacitance $C_m$ of the internodal regions. The increase in $R_m$ is much more significant than the decrease in $C_m$.\n- Effect on $\\lambda$: The large increase in $R_m$ leads to a very large increase in $\\lambda$. This allows the passive current generated at one node of Ranvier to spread much farther down the axon to depolarize the next node to threshold, which is the basis for rapid saltatory conduction.\n- Effect on $\\tau$: Myelination increases $R_m$ and decreases $C_m$. The time constant $\\tau = R_m C_m$ may not change as dramatically as $\\lambda$, and the decrease in $C_m$ helps to speed up the charging of the membrane. However, the dominant effect of myelination on propagation speed is the enormous increase in the length constant $\\lambda$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.158 & 1.00\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4994815"}, {"introduction": "With the concepts of the length and time constants in hand, we can now estimate a key functional parameter: conduction velocity.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins by defining the electrical parameters of the axon on a per-unit-length basis, derived from the given specific (per-unit-area or per-unit-volume) properties and the cylindrical geometry.\n\n1.  **Axial Resistance per Unit Length ($r_a$)**: The resistance of a uniform conductor is given by $R = \\rho L / A$, where $\\rho$ is the resistivity, $L$ is the length, and $A$ is the cross-sectional area. Here, the resistivity is the intracellular resistivity $r_i$. The axial resistance per unit length ($L=1$) is therefore $r_a = r_i / A$. The cross-sectional area of the cylindrical axon is $A = \\pi (d/2)^2 = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}$.\n    Substituting $A$ into the expression for $r_a$:\n    $$r_a = \\frac{r_i}{\\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}} = \\frac{4 r_i}{\\pi d^2}$$\n\n2.  **Membrane Resistance per Unit Length ($r_m$)**: The specific membrane resistance $R_m$ has units of resistance times area ($\\mathrm{\\Omega\\;cm^2}$). The total resistance of a patch of membrane is $R_{mem} = R_m / A_{mem}$, where $A_{mem}$ is the surface area of the patch. For a cylinder of length $L$, the surface area is $A_{mem} = (\\pi d)L$. The total membrane conductance of this length is $G_{mem} = 1/R_{mem} = A_{mem}/R_m = (\\pi d)L/R_m$. The conductance per unit length is $g_m = G_{mem}/L = \\pi d / R_m$. The membrane resistance per unit length, $r_m$, is the reciprocal of the conductance per unit length ($r_m = 1/g_m$).\n    $$r_m = \\frac{R_m}{\\pi d}$$\n\n3.  **Membrane Capacitance per Unit Length ($c_m$)**: The specific membrane capacitance $C_m$ has units of capacitance per unit area ($\\mathrm{F/cm^2}$). The total capacitance of a patch of membrane is $C_{mem} = C_m A_{mem}$. For a cylinder of length $L$, this is $C_{mem} = C_m (\\pi d) L$. The capacitance per unit length, $c_m$, is therefore:\n    $$c_m = \\frac{C_{mem}}{L} = C_m \\pi d$$\n\nWith these per-unit-length parameters, we can define the characteristic constants of the cable.\n\n4.  **Time Constant ($\\tau$)**: The membrane time constant $\\tau$ represents the time it takes for the membrane potential to change by a factor of $1 - 1/e$ in response to a step current injection. It is the product of the membrane resistance and capacitance for a given patch of membrane. In terms of per-unit-length parameters, it is given by $\\tau = r_m c_m$.\n    Substituting the expressions for $r_m$ and $c_m$:\n    $$\\tau = \\left(\\frac{R_m}{\\pi d}\\right) (C_m \\pi d) = R_m C_m$$\n    Note that the time constant is independent of the axon's diameter.\n\n5.  **Length Constant ($\\lambda$)**: The length constant $\\lambda$ (or space constant) describes the distance over which a steady-state subthreshold potential decays by a factor of $1/e$. It is determined by the ratio of membrane resistance to axial resistance.\n    $$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_m}{r_a}}$$\n    Substituting the expressions for $r_m$ and $r_a$:\n    $$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m / (\\pi d)}{4 r_i / (\\pi d^2)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m}{\\pi d} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4 r_i}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m d}{4 r_i}}$$\n\n6.  **Conduction Velocity ($v$)**: For active propagation of an action potential in an unmyelinated axon, the velocity can be estimated by considering the passive spread of current. The action potential at one point on the axon provides the current that depolarizes the adjacent region to threshold. The characteristic distance for this passive current spread is the length constant $\\lambda$, and the characteristic time for the membrane potential to change is the time constant $\\tau$. A simple estimate for the conduction velocity is the ratio of these characteristic spatiotemporal scales.\n    $$v \\approx \\frac{\\lambda}{\\tau}$$\n    Substituting the derived expressions for $\\lambda$ and $\\tau$:\n    $$v \\approx \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{R_m d}{4 r_i}}}{R_m C_m} = \\frac{1}{R_m C_m} \\frac{\\sqrt{R_m d}}{\\sqrt{4 r_i}} = \\frac{1}{C_m} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{R_m}} \\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{\\sqrt{4 r_i}} = \\frac{1}{C_m} \\sqrt{\\frac{d}{4 r_i R_m}}$$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nTo calculate the numerical value of $v$, we first convert all given parameters to a consistent set of SI units (meters, seconds, ohms, farads).\n\n- $d = 500\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m} = 500 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $R_m = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{k\\Omega\\;cm^2} = 0.3 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega} \\cdot (10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2 = 300\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega} \\cdot 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m^2} = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\;m^2}$\n- $C_m = 1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu F/cm^2} = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F} / (10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2 = 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F} / 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m^2} = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{F/m^2}$\n- $r_i = 35\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\;cm} = 35\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega} \\cdot 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 0.35\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\;m}$\n\nNow, we calculate $\\tau$ and $\\lambda$:\n\n- $\\tau = R_m C_m = (0.03\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\;m^2}) \\cdot (0.01\\,\\mathrm{F/m^2}) = 0.0003\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega \\cdot F} = 3 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n(Note: $1\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega \\cdot F} = 1\\,\\mathrm{s}$)\n\n- $\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m d}{4 r_i}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(0.03\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\;m^2})(5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m})}{4(0.35\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\;m})}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\;m^3}}{1.4\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\;m}}}$\n$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.5}{1.4} \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1.0714 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{10.714 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}} \\approx 3.273 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nFinally, we estimate the conduction velocity $v$:\n\n- $v \\approx \\frac{\\lambda}{\\tau} = \\frac{3.273 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{3 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{3.273}{0.3}\\,\\mathrm{m/s} \\approx 10.91\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $v \\approx 10.9\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\nThis estimated value is on the same order of magnitude as empirically measured conduction velocities for squid giant axons (typically $\\sim$$20-25\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$ at similar temperatures). The discrepancy arises because the approximation $v \\approx \\lambda/\\tau$ is a simplified model based on passive cable properties. It neglects the non-linear, regenerative dynamics of voltage-gated ion channels that actively drive the action potential, which results in a faster propagation speed than this simple passive estimate suggests.

The provided definitions are:\nSafety factor: $S = \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{delivered}}}{Q_{\\mathrm{threshold}}}$\nNodal delay: $t_{d} = \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{threshold}}}{I_{\\mathrm{ax}}}$ (defined for $S \\geq 1$)\n\nThe component terms are:\n$Q_{\\mathrm{delivered}} = I_{\\mathrm{ax}} \\, t_{p}$\n$Q_{\\mathrm{threshold}} = C_{n} \\, (V_{th} - V_{rest})$\n$I_{\\mathrm{ax}} = I_{Na} \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{\\lambda}\\right)$\n$I_{Na} = f_{\\mathrm{open}} \\, g_{Na} \\, A_{n} \\, (E_{Na} - V_{th})$\n$C_{n} = C_{m,\\mathrm{node}} \\, A_{n}$\n$A_{n} = 2 \\pi a l_{n}$\n\nWe can derive simplified expressions for $S$ and $t_{d}$ by substituting these definitions.\nFor the safety factor $S$:\n$$S = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{ax}} \\, t_{p}}{C_{n} \\, (V_{th} - V_{rest})} = \\frac{I_{Na} \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{\\lambda}\\right) \\, t_{p}}{C_{n} \\, (V_{th} - V_{rest})}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $I_{Na}$ and $C_{n}$:\n$$S = \\frac{\\left[f_{\\mathrm{open}} \\, g_{Na} \\, A_{n} \\, (E_{Na} - V_{th})\\right] \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{\\lambda}\\right) \\, t_{p}}{\\left[C_{m,\\mathrm{node}} \\, A_{n}\\right] \\, (V_{th} - V_{rest})}$$\nThe nodal area $A_n$ cancels, yielding an expression independent of the specific nodal geometry ($a$ and $l_n$ for the area, though $\\lambda$ still depends on $a$):\n$$S = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{open}} \\, g_{Na} \\, (E_{Na} - V_{th}) \\, t_{p}}{C_{m,\\mathrm{node}} \\, (V_{th} - V_{rest})} \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\n\nFrom the aformentioned definitions, we can also see the relationship $S = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{ax}} t_p}{Q_{\\mathrm{threshold}}}$ and $t_d = \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{threshold}}}{I_{\\mathrm{ax}}}$. This implies a simple relationship between $S$, $t_d$, and the sodium current pulse duration $t_p$:\n$$S = \\frac{t_p}{t_d} \\quad \\implies \\quad t_d = \\frac{t_p}{S}$$\nWe will use this relationship to find $t_{d}$ after calculating $S$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the space constant $\\lambda$ for the demyelinated internode. The formula is $\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_{m}}{r_{a}}}$, with $r_{a} = \\frac{\\rho_{a}}{\\pi a^{2}}$ and $r_{m} = \\frac{R_{m}}{2 \\pi a}$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m} / (2 \\pi a)}{\\rho_{a} / (\\pi a^{2})}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m} \\pi a^{2}}{2 \\pi a \\rho_{a}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a R_{m}}{2 \\rho_{a}}}$$\n\nThe problem states that for an internode with $50\\%$ myelin loss, the effective specific membrane resistance is halved.\n$R_{m}^{0} = 100 \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{2}$.\nSo, $R_{m} = \\frac{R_{m}^{0}}{2} = \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{2}$.\n\nThe given parameters in SI units are:\n$a = 5.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$\\rho_{a} = 0.70 \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{m}$\n$L = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$f_{\\mathrm{open}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$\n$g_{Na} = 3.0 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\mathrm{S} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$\n$E_{Na} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{V}$\n$V_{th} = -5.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{V}$\n$V_{rest} = -7.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{V}$\n$t_{p} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{s}$\n$C_{m,\\mathrm{node}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{F} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$\n\nNow, we calculate the space constant $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{(5.0 \\times 10^{-6}) \\cdot (50)}{2 \\cdot (0.70)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2.5 \\times 10^{-4}}{1.4}} \\approx \\sqrt{1.7857 \\times 10^{-4}} \\approx 1.3363 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the attenuation factor $\\exp(-L/\\lambda)$:\n$$\\frac{L}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.3363 \\times 10^{-2}} \\approx 0.07483$$\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{\\lambda}\\right) = \\exp(-0.07483) \\approx 0.9279$$\n\nNow we compute the terms for the safety factor $S$.\nDriving potential for sodium current: $E_{Na} - V_{th} = (6.0 \\times 10^{-2}) - (-5.0 \\times 10^{-2}) = 1.1 \\times 10^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{V}$.\nVoltage change required to reach threshold from rest: $V_{th} - V_{rest} = (-5.0 \\times 10^{-2}) - (-7.0 \\times 10^{-2}) = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n\nLet's compute the pre-factor in the expression for $S$:\n$$\\frac{f_{\\mathrm{open}} \\, g_{Na} \\, (E_{Na} - V_{th}) \\, t_{p}}{C_{m,\\mathrm{node}} \\, (V_{th} - V_{rest})} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-3}) \\cdot (3.0 \\times 10^{4}) \\cdot (1.1 \\times 10^{-1}) \\cdot (3.0 \\times 10^{-4})}{(1.0 \\times 10^{-2}) \\cdot (2.0 \\times 10^{-2})}$$\n$$= \\frac{30 \\cdot (1.1 \\times 10^{-1}) \\cdot (3.0 \\times 10^{-4})}{2.0 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{3.3 \\cdot (3.0 \\times 10^{-4})}{2.0 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{9.9 \\times 10^{-4}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-4}} = 4.95$$\n\nFinally, we calculate $S$:\n$$S = 4.95 \\times \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{\\lambda}\\right) = 4.95 \\times 0.9279 \\approx 4.5931$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the safety factor is $S = 4.59$.\n\nSince $S \\approx 4.59$, which is greater than $1$, action potential propagation is supported. We can now calculate the nodal delay $t_{d}$.\n$$t_{d} = \\frac{t_{p}}{S} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{s}}{4.5931} \\approx 6.5317 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nThe problem asks for the delay in microseconds ($\\mu \\mathrm{s}$).\n$$t_{d} = (6.5317 \\times 10^{-5}) \\cdot (10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}/\\mathrm{s}) = 65.317 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the delay is $t_{d} = 65.3 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}$.\n\nThe required ordered pair is $(S, t_{d})$.\n$S = 4.59$\n$t_{d} = 65.3$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 4.59 & 65.3 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4994791"}]}
