It presents a standard biophysical calculation based on realistic physiological parameters.\n\nThe derivation of the equilibrium potential for an ion begins with the fundamental thermodynamic condition for electrochemical equilibrium. At equilibrium, there is no net movement of the ion across the membrane, which requires that the electrochemical potential of the ion species be equal on both sides of the membrane. The electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}$, represents the total free energy per mole of an ion and is the sum of two components: the chemical potential, which depends on the concentration, and the electrical potential energy, which depends on the ion's charge and the electrical potential of the solution.\n\nThe molar electrochemical potential for an ion of valence $z$ at a concentration $[C]$ and electrical potential $V$ is given by:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu} = \\mu^0 + RT \\ln([C]) + zFV\n$$\nwhere $\\mu^0$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $F$ is Faraday's constant, and $z$ is the valence of the ion.\n\nAt equilibrium, the electrochemical potential inside the cell (intracellular, subscript $i$) must equal the electrochemical potential outside the cell (extracellular, subscript $o$):\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_{i} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{o}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\tilde{\\mu}$:\n$$\n\\mu^0 + RT \\ln([C]_i) + zFV_i = \\mu^0 + RT \\ln([C]_o) + zFV_o\n$$\nThe standard chemical potential $\\mu^0$ is an intrinsic property of the ion and is the same on both sides, so it cancels out:\n$$\nRT \\ln([C]_i) + zFV_i = RT \\ln([C]_o) + zFV_o\n$$\nTo find the equilibrium potential, which is the membrane potential difference $E_{\\text{ion}} = V_i - V_o$ at which this equilibrium occurs, we rearrange the equation to solve for this difference:\n$$\nzF(V_i - V_o) = RT \\ln([C]_o) - RT \\ln([C]_i)\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$:\n$$\nzF(V_i - V_o) = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{[C]_o}{[C]_i}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, solving for the equilibrium potential $E_{\\text{ion}} = V_i - V_o$ gives the Nernst equation:\n$$\nE_{\\text{ion}} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[C]_o}{[C]_i}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the equilibrium potential of an ion with valence $z$.\n\nThis result has a direct implication for the Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz (GHK) equation, which describes the reversal potential of a membrane permeable to multiple ions. The large positive value of the calcium equilibrium potential, $E_{\\text{Ca}}$, implies that it acts as a powerful depolarizing influence, pulling the reversal potential of any calcium-permeable channel to a significantly positive value.

Instead, it is a steady state where the net electric current across the membrane is zero ($\\sum_s I_s = 0$), while individual ions may still have non-zero fluxes. The derivation starts from the Nernst-Planck equation for ionic flux, incorporating both diffusion and drift in an electric field. Under the constant-field approximation (the electric field is constant across the membrane), this equation can be integrated to yield an expression for the current $I_s$ carried by each ion $s$, known as the GHK current equation.\n\nFor a system with monovalent cations ($C_i^+$) and anions ($A_j^-$), the condition of zero total current, $\\sum_i I_{C_i^+} + \\sum_j I_{A_j^-} = 0$, can be solved for the steady-state potential $V_m$. This procedure, after algebraic manipulation, yields the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) voltage equation. For the ions $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, all of which are monovalent ($|z| = 1$), the equation is:\n$$ V_m = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{K}}[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_o + P_{\\mathrm{Na}}[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_o + P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_i}{P_{\\mathrm{K}}[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_i + P_{\\mathrm{Na}}[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_i + P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_o} \\right) $$\nNote that for the anion ($\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$), the intracellular and extracellular concentrations are inverted in the expression, a direct consequence of its negative valence.\n\nNow, we compute the value of $V_m$. The relative permeabilities $P_{\\mathrm{K}} : P_{\\mathrm{Na}} : P_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = 1.00 : 0.040 : 0.45$ can be used directly, as any scaling factor would cancel in the fraction.

The potential becomes more positive (or less negative) with increasing temperature. If $a_{i,o}  a_{i,i}$ (e.g., $K^+$), then $\\ln(\\dots)  0$ and $\\frac{\\partial E_i}{\\partial T}  0$. The potential becomes more negative (hyperpolarizes) with increasing temperature.\n- For anions ($z_i  0$): The sign is reversed. For $Cl^-$ ($z_i = -1$), if $a_{i,o}  a_{i,i}$, then $\\ln(\\dots) > 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial E_i}{\\partial T}  0$. The potential becomes more negative with increasing temperature.\n\nMagnitude: The magnitude of the sensitivity, $\\left|\\frac{\\partial E_i}{\\partial T}\\right|$, is inversely proportional to the absolute value of the valence, $|z_i|$, and directly proportional to the magnitude of the logarithmic term, $|\\ln(a_{i,o}/a_{i,i})|$. This implies that equilibrium potentials for monovalent ions (e.g., $K^+$, $Na^+$) are twice as sensitive to temperature as those for divalent ions (e.g., $Ca^{2+}$, $Mg^{2+}$), assuming an identical activity ratio.\n\nPhysiological Implications:\n- Ectotherms: These animals have body temperatures that vary with the external environment. A change in ambient temperature leads to a direct change in their internal body temperature $T$. Consequently, the equilibrium potentials for key ions shift, as dictated by $\\Delta E_i \\approx \\frac{\\partial E_i}{\\partial T} \\Delta T$. For example, as an ectotherm cools, its resting membrane potential (largely set by $E_K$) would typically become less negative (depolarize) (since $\\frac{\\partial E_i}{\\partial T}$ is negative for a typical K+ gradient), which alters neuronal excitability and physiological processes. Ectotherms must possess compensatory mechanisms, such as adjusting ion channel expression or pump activity (thermal acclimation), to maintain cellular function over a wide temperature range.\n- Endotherms: These animals maintain a constant, high internal body temperature through metabolism. This homeostatic regulation ensures that $T$ is stable, and therefore, the Nernst potentials $E_i$ are also highly stable. This stability is critical for the reliable and high-performance function of the nervous system and other excitable tissues. The energetic cost of endothermy provides the significant advantage of a stable internal physicochemical environment, which permits complex and consistent neural computation independent of external temperature fluctuations.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{R}{z_i F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{a_{i,o}}{a_{i,i}}\\right)} $$", "id": "5073867"}]}
