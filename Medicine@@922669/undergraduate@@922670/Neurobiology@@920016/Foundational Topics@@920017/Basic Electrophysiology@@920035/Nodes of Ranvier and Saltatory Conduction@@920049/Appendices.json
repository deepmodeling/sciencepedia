A well-tested biophysical observation is that the thickness of myelin, relative to the axon caliber, modulates conduction velocity by decreasing membrane capacitance and increasing membrane resistance, thereby optimizing the speed of the saltatory process. A standard geometric descriptor of myelination is the g-ratio, defined as the ratio of the inner axon diameter to the total fiber diameter. Specifically, if the inner axon diameter is $d$ and the total fiber diameter (axon plus myelin) is $D$, then the g-ratio $g$ is $g = d/D$. Empirical and theoretical studies of mammalian myelinated axons predict that conduction velocity is optimized when the g-ratio lies within an interval that we take here as $[0.6,\\,0.7]$. \n\nConsider a myelinated axon with inner axon diameter $d = 2.0$ micrometers and total fiber diameter $D = 3.2$ micrometers. Using the core definition of g-ratio $g = d/D$, first compute $g$. Then, to quantitatively assess how close this axon is to the predicted optimal range for conduction velocity, define the deviation function\n$$\\Delta(g) = \\max\\{0,\\, 0.6 - g,\\, g - 0.7\\},$$\nwhich returns the shortest distance of $g$ to the interval $[0.6,\\,0.7]$ (zero if $g$ lies inside the interval, a positive value otherwise). \n\nCompute $\\Delta(g)$ for this axon.
