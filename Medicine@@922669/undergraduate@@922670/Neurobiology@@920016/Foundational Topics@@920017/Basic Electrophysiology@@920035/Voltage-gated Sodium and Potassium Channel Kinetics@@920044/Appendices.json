At thermal equilibrium, the ratio of the probabilities of these states, $P_O$ and $P_C$, is governed by the Boltzmann distribution, which depends on the free energy difference $\\Delta G = G_O - G_C$:\n$$\n\\frac{P_O}{P_C} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe sum of probabilities must be unity, so $P_O + P_C = 1$, which implies $P_C = 1 - P_O$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{P_O}{1 - P_O} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nWe are given that the free energy difference is a linear function of voltage $V$:\n$$\n\\Delta G(V) = \\Delta G_{0} - z\\,e\\,V\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\Delta G$ into the probability ratio yields:\n$$\n\\frac{P_O}{1 - P_O} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{0} - z\\,e\\,V}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nTo solve for $P_O(V)$, we can rearrange the equation:\n$$\nP_O = (1 - P_O) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{0} - z\\,e\\,V}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nP_O \\left(1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{0} - z\\,e\\,V}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{0} - z\\,e\\,V}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nP_O(V) = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{0} - z\\,e\\,V}{k_B T}\\right)}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{0} - z\\,e\\,V}{k_B T}\\right)}\n$$\nTo match the standard logistic function form, we divide the numerator and denominator by the exponential term:\n$$\nP_O(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_{0} - z\\,e\\,V}{k_B T}\\right)}\n$$\nThe problem states that experimental data are fit to a logistic function of the form:\n$$\nP_O(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{1/2} - V}{k}\\right)}\n$$\nBy definition, the half-activation voltage $V_{1/2}$ is the membrane potential at which the open probability is $1/2$, i.e., $P_O(V_{1/2}) = 1/2$. For this to be true in our derived expression, the argument of the exponential must be zero at $V = V_{1/2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta G_{0} - z\\,e\\,V_{1/2}}{k_B T} = 0 \\implies \\Delta G_{0} = z\\,e\\,V_{1/2}\n$$\nThis gives a physical meaning to $\\Delta G_0$: it is the voltage-dependent part of the free energy at the half-activation potential.

This neglects the existence of multiple sub-conductance states, intermediate closed states, or inactivated states.\n2.  **Thermal Equilibrium:** The steady-state open probability is assumed to be described by equilibrium statistical mechanics (the Boltzmann distribution). This requires that the membrane potential is held constant for a duration sufficient for the system to relax to its equilibrium distribution of states.\n3.  **Linear Voltage Dependence of Free Energy:** The free energy difference between the states is assumed to vary linearly with the membrane potential. This is an approximation equivalent to assuming that the gating charges move across a uniform electric field that spans the entire thickness of the membrane's hydrophobic core.\n4.  **Collective Charge Movement:** The parameter $z$ represents a collective, \"apparent\" charge. It is the total charge displacement across the membrane electric field, arising from the conformational change. It does not necessarily correspond to a single physical particle with charge $z \\cdot e$ but is the sum of contributions from multiple charged residues moving partial distances through the field.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4.24}\n$$", "id": "5078885"}, {"introduction": "Measuring the kinetics of ion channels requires careful experimental design, especially for channels like the voltage-gated sodium channel where fast activation is quickly followed by inactivation.

The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe primary challenge in measuring the activation parameters ($m_{\\infty}(V)$, $\\tau_m(V)$) for the sodium channel is to isolate the behavior of the activation gate ($m$) from the confounding influence of the inactivation gate ($h$). The total current is proportional to the product $m^3h$.\n\n**Principle-Based Derivation of the Correct Protocol**\n\n1.  **Controlling Initial Conditions**: To study activation, we must start from a well-defined initial state. The ideal initial state is one where the channels are fully available to open, which means inactivation is completely removed. Inactivation ($h$) is removed by hyperpolarization. Therefore, prior to any test pulse, the membrane potential must be held at or pulsed to a very negative potential (e.g., $-100\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to $-120\\,\\mathrm{mV}$). At such potentials, the steady-state inactivation variable $h_{\\infty}(V)$ approaches $1$. Holding there for a sufficient duration (several times $\\tau_h$ at that hyperpolarized potential) ensures that the initial condition for the test pulse is $h(0) \\approx 1$. At this same potential, the activation gates will be fully closed, so $m(0) \\approx m_{\\infty}(V_{hyperpolarized}) \\approx 0$.\n\n2.  **Isolating Activation Dynamics**: Upon stepping to a depolarized test voltage $V$, both $m$ and $h$ gates will begin to move towards their new steady-state values, $m_{\\infty}(V)$ and $h_{\\infty}(V)$.\n    - $m(t)$ evolves from $\\approx 0$ towards $m_{\\infty}(V)$ with time constant $\\tau_m(V)$.\n    - $h(t)$ evolves from $\\approx 1$ towards $h_{\\infty}(V)$ with time constant $\\tau_h(V)$.\n    \n    A crucial feature of sodium channels is the separation of timescales: activation is significantly faster than inactivation. That is, for most relevant voltages, $\\tau_m(V) \\ll \\tau_h(V)$. We can exploit this by using very short test pulses with duration $t_{pulse}$ such that $t_{pulse} \\ll \\tau_h(V)$. During this brief interval, the slower $h$-gate will not have had a chance to move significantly from its initial value. We can therefore make the approximation $h(t) \\approx h(0) \\approx 1$ for $0 \\le t \\le t_{pulse}$.\n\n3.  **Formulating the Fitting Equation**: With the approximation $h(t) \\approx 1$ and the initial condition $m(0) \\approx 0$, the dynamics of the current during the short test pulse are governed solely by activation.\n    The solution to the differential equation for $m$ is $m(t;V) = m_{\\infty}(V) + (m(0;V) - m_{\\infty}(V))e^{-t/\\tau_m(V)}$. With $m(0;V) \\approx 0$, this simplifies to:\n    $$m(t;V) \\approx m_{\\infty}(V)\\left(1 - e^{-t/\\tau_m(V)}\\right)$$\n    Substituting this and $h(t;V) \\approx 1$ into the current equation gives:\n    $$I_{Na}(t;V) \\approx \\bar{g}_{Na}\\, \\left[m_{\\infty}(V)\\left(1 - e^{-t/\\tau_m(V)}\\right)\\right]^3 \\, (V - E_{Na})$$\n    $$I_{Na}(t;V) \\approx \\bar{g}_{Na}\\,(V - E_{Na})\\,m_{\\infty}(V)^3\\,\\left(1 - e^{-t/\\tau_m(V)}\\right)^3$$\n    This equation describes the rising phase of the sodium current. To facilitate fitting, one can linearize the exponential dependence by transforming the data. Let the conductance be $g(t;V) = I_{Na}(t;V)/(V-E_{Na})$. Then:\n    $$g(t;V)^{1/3} \\approx \\left(\\bar{g}_{Na}\\,m_{\\infty}(V)^3\\right)^{1/3} \\left(1 - e^{-t/\\tau_m(V)}\\right)$$\n    $$g(t;V)^{1/3} \\approx \\bar{g}_{Na}^{1/3}m_{\\infty}(V) \\left(1 - e^{-t/\\tau_m(V)}\\right)$$\n    This transforms the data into a simple single-exponential rise, $A(V)(1 - e^{-t/\\tau_m(V)})$, where the amplitude $A(V) = \\bar{g}_{Na}^{1/3}m_{\\infty}(V)$. Fitting this function to the transformed current data for each voltage $V$ yields $\\tau_m(V)$ and the relative amplitude profile $A(V)$, which is proportional to $m_{\\infty}(V)$. The curve $m_{\\infty}(V)$ can be obtained by normalizing $A(V)$ by its maximum value, which occurs at large depolarizations where $m_{\\infty}(V) \\to 1$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A.**\n- **Protocol**: \"Use a hyperpolarized holding potential near $-70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and, before each test step, deliver a brief hyperpolarizing prepulse to $-120\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ for $100$ to $200\\,\\mathrm{ms}$... step to a family of test voltages $V$... for very short durations ($\\leq 1$ to $2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$)...\"\nThis protocol is scientifically sound. The prepulse to $-120\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ robustly removes inactivation, ensuring $h(0) \\approx 1$. The very short test pulses are the key to justifying the approximation that $h(t)$ does not change significantly during the measurement, i.e., $h(t) \\approx 1$.\n- **Fitting Equations**: The option proposes fitting $I(t;V)\\approx \\bar{g}_{Na}\\left(V - E_{Na}\\right)\\left[m_{\\infty}(V)\\left(1-e^{-t/\\tau_m(V)}\\right)\\right]^3$. This equation is a direct consequence of the Hodgkin-Huxley model under the approximations justified by the protocol, as derived above. The alternative fitting of the cube-root-scaled current $J(t;V)$ to $A(V)\\left(1-e^{-t/\\tau_m(V)}\\right)$ is a standard and robust method for extracting the parameters. The interpretation of $A(V) = \\bar{g}_{Na}^{1/3} m_{\\infty}(V)$ and the method for obtaining the shape of $m_{\\infty}(V)$ are also correct.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**. This option provides a complete and accurate description of the standard experimental and analytical procedure for isolating and quantifying sodium channel activation kinetics.\n\n**B.**\n- **Protocol**: \"Use a depolarizing prepulse to $-40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$... to 'remove inactivation,' then apply long test pulses ($\\geq 50\\,\\mathrm{ms}$)...\"\nThis protocol is fundamentally flawed. A depolarizing prepulse to $-40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ *causes* inactivation, it does not remove it. For typical sodium channels, $h_{\\infty}(-40\\,\\mathrm{mV})$ is close to $0$. This protocol is designed to study inactivation, not activation. The use of long test pulses further ensures that the current time course is dominated by inactivation, making it impossible to \"ignore inactivation\".\n- **Fitting Equations**: The suggested fit, $I(t;V) = I_{\\infty}(V)\\left(1 - e^{-t/\\tau_m(V)}\\right)$, is incorrect for several reasons: (1) it completely ignores the inactivation process which is prominent due to the protocol design, (2) it ignores the fact that activation is gated by $m^3$, not $m$, so the rise is not a single exponential, and (3) a steady-state current $I_{\\infty}(V)$ for sodium is typically zero due to complete inactivation, so the entire premise of the fit is unsound.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The protocol is counter-productive to the stated goal, and the analysis is based on incorrect assumptions and equations.\n\n**C.**\n- **Protocol**: \"Omit any prepulse and hold at $-50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Apply test steps for $20$ to $50\\,\\mathrm{ms}$...\"\nHolding at $-50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ induces significant steady-state inactivation ($h_{\\infty}(-50\\,\\mathrm{mV}) < 1$), so the initial condition $h(0) \\approx 1$ is not met. The long test pulses ($20$-$50\\,\\mathrm{ms}$) ensure that inactivation develops substantially during the pulse. The protocol fails to isolate activation.\n- **Fitting Equations**: Using the peak current $I_{peak}$ to calculate $m_{\\infty}(V)$ is a common approximation, but it is flawed because the peak occurs at a time when $h(t)$ has already declined from its initial value. Thus, $I_{peak}$ is a function of both activation and inactivation kinetics and does not purely reflect $m_{\\infty}(V)$. Fitting the rising phase to a single exponential $I_{peak}(V)\\left(1 - e^{-t/\\tau_m(V)}\\right)$ is also incorrect because the rise is proportional to $(1-e^{-t/\\tau_m(V)})^3$, which has a sigmoidal (\"S\"-shaped) onset, not that of a simple exponential.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The protocol confounds activation and inactivation, and the fitting methods are approximations that are inconsistent with the underlying $m^3h$ model.\n\n**D.**\n- **Protocol**: A tail current protocol is proposed.\nThe use of tail currents is a valid experimental strategy for measuring the steady-state activation curve ($m_{\\infty}(V)$), as it maps the voltage-dependence of activation onto current amplitudes at a single, constant repolarization potential.\n- **Fitting Equations**: The option presents two major errors in its analysis. First, it states the tail current is $I_{tail}(0^+;V) = \\bar{g}_{Na} m_{\\infty}(V)\\left(V_{tail}-E_{Na}\\right)$. The correct formula must include the cubic dependence on the activation variable: $I_{tail} \\propto m^3$. The equation should be $I_{tail}(0^+;V) \\approx \\bar{g}_{Na}\\,m_{\\infty}(V)^3\\,h(0.5ms;V)\\,(V_{tail}-E_{Na})$. Omitting the exponent of $3$ is a critical error. Second, it claims $\\tau_m(V)$ can be estimated from the decay time constant of the tail current. The time constant of the tail current reflects gating kinetics *at the tail potential* ($V_{tail}$), i.e., it measures $\\tau_m(V_{tail})$.

The solution will be derived from first principles as requested.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the time constant $\\tau_x$ and the rate constants $\\alpha_x$ and $\\beta_x$. The governing differential equation for a gating variable $x$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\alpha_{x}(V,T)(1 - x) - \\beta_{x}(V,T)x\n$$\nAt a constant voltage $V$ and temperature $T$, the rate coefficients are constant. We can rearrange this equation into the standard form of a first-order linear ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\alpha_{x} - \\alpha_{x}x - \\beta_{x}x\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = -(\\alpha_{x} + \\beta_{x})x + \\alpha_{x}\n$$\nThis equation describes the relaxation of $x$ towards its steady-state value, $x_{\\infty} = \\frac{\\alpha_x}{\\alpha_x + \\beta_x}$. The standard form of such a relaxation process is $\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{x_{\\infty} - x}{\\tau_x}$. To match our equation to this form, we write:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = (\\alpha_{x} + \\beta_{x})\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_x}{\\alpha_x + \\beta_x} - x\\right)\n$$\nBy comparing this with $\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{x_{\\infty} - x}{\\tau_x}$, we can identify the time constant $\\tau_x$ as:\n$$\n\\tau_{x} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_{x} + \\beta_{x}}\n$$\nThis confirms the problem's statement that $\\tau_x$ is determined by the total transition rate, which is the sum of the forward ($\\alpha_x$) and backward ($\\beta_x$) rates.\n\nNext, we derive the scaling of the time constant $\\tau_n$ with temperature. Let $T_1 = 20^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and $T_2 = 30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, such that $T_2 = T_1 + 10^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. The problem states that the rate constants for the potassium activation gate, $\\alpha_n$ and $\\beta_n$, scale with the same temperature coefficient, $Q_{10}$. From the definition $Q_{10} = \\frac{k(T + 10\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})}{k(T)}$, we have:\n$$\n\\alpha_{n}(T_2) = Q_{10} \\cdot \\alpha_{n}(T_1)\n$$\n$$\n\\beta_{n}(T_2) = Q_{10} \\cdot \\beta_{n}(T_1)\n$$\nThe time constant at temperature $T_2$, denoted $\\tau_n(T_2)$, is given by:\n$$\n\\tau_{n}(T_2) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_{n}(T_2) + \\beta_{n}(T_2)}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the rate constants at $T_2$:\n$$\n\\tau_{n}(T_2) = \\frac{1}{Q_{10} \\cdot \\alpha_{n}(T_1) + Q_{10} \\cdot \\beta_{n}(T_1)}\n$$\nFactoring out $Q_{10}$ from the denominator:\n$$\n\\tau_{n}(T_2) = \\frac{1}{Q_{10} \\left( \\alpha_{n}(T_1) + \\beta_{n}(T_1) \\right)}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{1}{\\alpha_{n}(T_1) + \\beta_{n}(T_1)}$ is simply the time constant at temperature $T_1$, or $\\tau_n(T_1)$. Therefore, we arrive at the scaling relationship:\n$$\n\\tau_{n}(T_2) = \\frac{\\tau_{n}(T_1)}{Q_{10}}\n$$\nThis derivation shows that the time constant of the gating variable is inversely proportional to the $Q_{10}$ value for a $10^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ increase in temperature.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\tau_n$ at $30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. We are given:\n- $\\tau_{n}(20^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) = 3.2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$\n- $Q_{10} = 2.5$\n\nUsing the derived scaling law:\n$$\n\\tau_{n}(30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) = \\frac{3.2\\,\\mathrm{ms}}{2.5} = 1.28\\,\\mathrm{ms}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures, so the result is $1.280\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nFinally, we provide a justification for how this change in $\\tau_n$ influences the action potential (AP). The problem specifies that we should assume both voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels have similar temperature sensitivities. This implies that the time constants for all relevant gating variables (e.g., $\\tau_m$ and $\\tau_h$ for sodium channels, and $\\tau_n$ for potassium channels) decrease as temperature rises, according to the scaling $\\tau \\propto 1/Q_{10}$. A smaller time constant signifies faster channel kinetics; the gates respond more quickly to changes in membrane voltage.\n\nThe effects on the AP shape and timing are as follows:\n$1$. **Faster Depolarization:** The activation of sodium channels (governed by the $m$-gate) is faster because $\\tau_m$ decreases. This leads to a more rapid influx of $\\text{Na}^+$ ions, resulting in a steeper upstroke of the AP.\n$2$. **Faster Repolarization:** As calculated, $\\tau_n$ decreases. This means the delayed rectifier potassium channels activate more quickly. A faster activation of this repolarizing current causes a more rapid efflux of $\\text{K}^+$ ions, resulting in a steeper downstroke of the AP.\n$3$. **Shorter AP Duration:** The combination of a faster upstroke and a more significantly accelerated downstroke leads to a reduction in the total width of the AP.\n$4$. **Increased Firing Rate Capability:** A shorter AP duration, along with faster recovery of channel gates from their refractory states, decreases the overall refractory period. This allows the neuron to sustain higher firing frequencies in response to a constant depolarizing stimulus.\n\nIn summary, the increased temperature speeds up all channel kinetic processes, leading to an action potential that is faster, narrower, and allows for a higher rate of repetitive firing.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.280}\n$$", "id": "5078896"}]}
