The neuronal membrane is modeled as a parallel-plate capacitor. Let the area of the capacitor plates be $A$ and the separation between them (the membrane thickness) be $d$. The space between the plates is filled with a dielectric material (the lipid bilayer) with absolute permittivity $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_r\\epsilon_0$. Let a charge $+Q$ be on one side of the membrane (e.g., the extracellular side) and $-Q$ on the other (intracellular side). The surface charge density is $\\sigma = Q/A$.\n\nWe apply Gauss's law for the electric displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$, which states that for any closed surface, $\\oint \\mathbf{D} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = Q_{free,enc}$, where $Q_{free,enc}$ is the total free charge enclosed. We construct a cylindrical Gaussian surface (a \"pillbox\") that pierces one of the conductive surfaces and has one cap inside the conductor (where the field is zero) and the other cap inside the dielectric membrane. The area of the cap is $A_g$. Due to the planar symmetry, the displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$ is uniform and perpendicular to the membrane surface. Thus, the flux is non-zero only through the cap inside the dielectric. Gauss's law simplifies to $D A_g = \\sigma A_g$, which gives the magnitude of the displacement field as:\n$$\nD = \\sigma\n$$\nThe relationship between the electric displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$ and the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ in a linear, isotropic dielectric material is given by the constitutive relation $\\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon \\mathbf{E}$. Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field within the membrane is constant and given by:\n$$\nE = \\frac{D}{\\epsilon} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon}\n$$\nThe potential difference $V$ across the membrane is the integral of the electric field across the thickness $d$:\n$$\nV = \\int_{0}^{d} E \\, dz = E \\cdot d = \\frac{\\sigma d}{\\epsilon}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\sigma = Q/A$, we get:\n$$\nV = \\frac{(Q/A)d}{\\epsilon} = \\frac{Qd}{A\\epsilon}\n$$\nThe capacitance $C$ is defined as $C = Q/V$.
