The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and a clear simplifying assumption to guide the calculation. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and internally consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We will proceed with a full solution.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the IPSP Amplitude**\n\nFrom first principles, the flow of ions through a channel can be described by an Ohm's law analogy. The synaptic current, $I_{\\text{syn}}$, flowing through the $\\text{GABA}_\\text{A}$ receptor channels is given by the product of the synaptic conductance, $g_{\\text{syn}}$, and the electrochemical driving force. The driving force is the difference between the membrane potential, $V_m$, and the reversal potential for the ions passing through the channel, $E_{\\text{Cl}}$. By convention, an outward flow of positive charge is a positive current.\n\n$$I_{\\text{syn}} = g_{\\text{syn}}(V_m - E_{\\text{Cl}})$$\n\nAt the moment the synaptic conductance reaches its peak, $g_{\\text{syn}}$, the membrane potential is still at its baseline value, $V_m = V_0$. Thus, the peak instantaneous synaptic current is:\n\n$$I_{\\text{syn, peak}} = g_{\\text{syn}}(V_0 - E_{\\text{Cl}})$$\n\nThe problem states that the channel is primarily permeable to chloride ions ($\\text{Cl}^-$). With $V_0 = -65\\,\\text{mV}$ and $E_{\\text{Cl}} = -75\\,\\text{mV}$, the driving force $(V_0 - E_{\\text{Cl}})$ is positive:\n$$V_0 - E_{\\text{Cl}} = -65\\,\\text{mV} - (-75\\,\\text{mV}) = 10\\,\\text{mV} = 10 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{V}$$\nThis positive driving force results in a positive (outward) conventional current, $I_{\\text{syn, peak}} > 0$. Since the charge carrier is the negative chloride ion, an outward conventional current corresponds to an *inward* flow of $\\text{Cl}^-$ ions. This influx of negative charge will cause the membrane potential to become more negative, i.e., to hyperpolarize.\n\nThe problem directs us to approximate the resulting change in membrane potential, $\\Delta V$, by treating the synaptic current as an injected current flowing across the passive membrane resistance, $R_m$. The change in voltage across a resistor due to an injected current, $I_{\\text{inj}}$, is given by $\\Delta V = I_{\\text{inj}} R_m$. The synaptic current $I_{\\text{syn}}$ flows out of the cell, so it is equivalent to an injected current of $I_{\\text{inj}} = -I_{\\text{syn}}$. Therefore, the change in membrane potential is:\n\n$$\\Delta V \\approx -I_{\\text{syn, peak}} R_m$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $I_{\\text{syn, peak}}$:\n\n$$\\Delta V \\approx -g_{\\text{syn}}(V_0 - E_{\\text{Cl}})R_m$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values, ensuring consistent S.I. units (Volts, Siemens, Ohms):\n-   $g_{\\text{syn}} = 1.5\\,\\text{nS} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{S}$\n-   $V_0 - E_{\\text{Cl}} = 10\\,\\text{mV} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{V}$\n-   $R_m = 80\\,\\text{M}\\Omega = 80 \\times 10^6\\,\\Omega$\n\n$$\\Delta V \\approx -(1.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{S}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{V}) \\times (80 \\times 10^6\\,\\Omega)$$\n$$\\Delta V \\approx -(1.5 \\times 1.0 \\times 80) \\times 10^{(-9 - 2 + 6)}\\,\\text{V}$$\n$$\\Delta V \\approx -120 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{V}$$\n$$\\Delta V \\approx -1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{V}$$\n\nConverting the result back to millivolts:\n$$\\Delta V \\approx -1.2\\,\\text{mV}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\Delta V = -1.20\\,\\text{mV}$$\nThe negative sign correctly indicates a hyperpolarizing potential, consistent with an IPSP under these conditions.\n\n**Part 2: Conditions for a Depolarizing $\\text{GABA}_\\text{A}$ Response**\n\nThe sign of the initial voltage change, $\\Delta V$, is determined by the sign of the driving force, $(V_0 - E_{\\text{syn}})$, where $E_{\\text{syn}}$ is the effective reversal potential of the synaptic channel. The response is depolarizing ($\\Delta V > 0$) if the initial current is inward (negative conventional current), which occurs when the driving force is negative, i.e., $V_0 < E_{\\text{syn}}$. Two primary biophysical conditions can lead to this situation for a $\\text{GABA}_\\text{A}$ receptor.\n\n1.  **Baseline Depolarization Relative to $E_{\\text{syn}}$**: The direction of ion flow depends on the relationship between the membrane potential and the reversal potential. GABAergic inhibition is often \"shunting\" because it tends to clamp the membrane potential near the GABA reversal potential, $E_{GABA}$. If the neuron's resting potential $V_0$ is already more negative than $E_{GABA}$, opening $\\text{GABA}_\\text{A}$ channels will cause a net efflux of $\\text{Cl}^-$ ions (an inward conventional current). This leads to a depolarization. For example, if $E_{\\text{Cl}}$ were $-60\\,\\text{mV}$ and $V_0$ were $-70\\,\\text{mV}$, the driving force $(V_0 - E_{\\text{Cl}})$ would be $-10\\,\\text{mV}$, causing a depolarizing response. Even though the potential becomes less negative, the action is still considered inhibitory because $E_{GABA}$ is typically well below the action potential threshold (e.g., $\\approx -50\\,\\text{mV}$). By increasing conductance, the synapse opposes changes that would move the potential toward threshold, thereby shunting excitatory inputs and inhibiting firing.\n\n2.  **Bicarbonate ($\\text{HCO}_3^-$) Contribution**: $\\text{GABA}_\\text{A}$ receptor channels are not perfectly selective for chloride; they also have a significant permeability to bicarbonate anions ($\\text{HCO}_3^-$). The permeability ratio, $P_{\\text{HCO}_3}/P_{\\text{Cl}}$, is typically in the range of $0.2$ to $0.4$. The reversal potential of a channel permeable to multiple ionic species is a weighted average of the individual Nernst potentials for those ions. The effective reversal potential of the $\\text{GABA}_\\text{A}$ channel, $E_{GABA}$, can be estimated using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation or, more simply, from the relative conductances ($g_i$):\n    $$E_{GABA} = \\frac{g_{\\text{Cl}}E_{\\text{Cl}} + g_{\\text{HCO}_3}E_{\\text{HCO}_3}}{g_{\\text{Cl}} + g_{\\text{HCO}_3}}$$\n    The Nernst potential for bicarbonate, $E_{\\text{HCO}_3}$, is typically much more depolarized than $E_{\\text{Cl}}$, often around $-10\\,\\text{mV}$ to $-20\\,\\text{mV}$. In contrast, $E_{\\text{Cl}}$ is hyperpolarized, near the resting potential (e.g., $-75\\,\\text{mV}$).\n    Due to the contribution of the more positive $E_{\\text{HCO}_3}$, the composite reversal potential $E_{GABA}$ is always depolarized relative to $E_{\\text{Cl}}$. For example, with $E_{\\text{Cl}} = -75\\,\\text{mV}$, $E_{\\text{HCO}_3} = -15\\,\\text{mV}$, and a conductance ratio $g_{\\text{HCO}_3}/g_{\\text{Cl}} = 0.25$, the effective reversal potential is:\n    $$E_{GABA} = \\frac{1 \\cdot (-75\\,\\text{mV}) + 0.25 \\cdot (-15\\,\\text{mV})}{1 + 0.25} = \\frac{-75 - 3.75}{1.25}\\,\\text{mV} = \\frac{-78.75}{1.25}\\,\\text{mV} = -63\\,\\text{mV}$$\n    In this case, the effective reversal potential is $E_{GABA} = -63\\,\\text{mV}$. If the neuron's baseline potential is $V_0 = -65\\,\\text{mV}$ (as given in the problem), then $V_0 < E_{GABA}$. The driving force $(V_0 - E_{GABA})$ is negative ($(-65) - (-63) = -2\\,\\text{mV}$), resulting in an influx of positive charge (net effect of $\\text{Cl}^-$ influx and $\\text{HCO}_3^-$ efflux), which causes a depolarization. This phenomenon of depolarizing GABAergic inhibition is particularly prominent in developing neurons, which maintain a higher intracellular chloride concentration, but is a general property of all synapses using $\\text{GABA}_\\text{A}$ receptors due to their bicarbonate permeability.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1.20}$$", "id": "5021858"}, {"introduction": "The intricate branching of a neuron is not merely for show; the location of a synapse is a key determinant of its influence.

A complete, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\nThe solution requires a multi-step calculation to trace the propagation and transformation of the voltage signal from the distal dendrite to the axon initial segment (AIS).\n\n**Step 1: Attenuation of the EPSP from the Synaptic Site to the Soma**\nThe voltage attenuation along a passive cable is described by the steady-state cable equation, which, for a signal propagating from its origin, is given by:\n$$V(x) = V_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nHere, $V_0$ is the initial voltage change at the origin ($x=0$), $\\lambda$ is the spatial length constant of the cable, and $V(x)$ is the voltage at a distance $x$ from the origin.\n\nFor the dendritic segment, the initial voltage is $V_{\\text{syn}} = 5.0$ mV, the distance to the soma is $x_{\\text{dend}} = 600$ $\\mu$m, and the dendritic length constant is $\\lambda_{\\text{dend}} = 250$ $\\mu$m. The voltage arriving at the soma, before considering the effect of the inhibitory synapse, which we denote as $V_{\\text{soma, pre-shunt}}$, is:\n$$V_{\\text{soma, pre-shunt}} = V_{\\text{syn}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_{\\text{dend}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{dend}}}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\frac{x_{\\text{dend}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{dend}}} = \\frac{600 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{m}}{250 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{m}} = 2.4$$\n$$V_{\\text{soma, pre-shunt}} = (5.0 \\text{ mV}) \\exp(-2.4)$$\n\n**Step 2: Effect of Shunting Inhibition at the Soma**\nThe arriving EPSP drives a synaptic current that depolarizes the soma. In the absence of inhibition, this current, $I_{\\text{syn, eff}}$, flows through the somatic leak resistance $R_{\\text{in}} = 1/g_L$ to produce the voltage $V_{\\text{soma, pre-shunt}}$. According to Ohm's law:\n$$I_{\\text{syn, eff}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{soma, pre-shunt}}}{R_{\\text{in}}} = V_{\\text{soma, pre-shunt}} \\cdot g_L$$\nThe problem states that a co-active shunting inhibitory synapse adds a conductance $g_{\\text{inh}} = 20$ nS at the soma. Since it is a shunting synapse, its reversal potential is at the resting potential, so it only adds conductance without driving current itself. The new total somatic conductance, $g_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the leak conductance and the inhibitory conductance:\n$$g_{\\text{total}} = g_L + g_{\\text{inh}}$$\nThe same effective synaptic current $I_{\\text{syn, eff}}$ now flows through this larger total conductance, resulting in a smaller peak voltage at the soma, $V_{\\text{soma, post-shunt}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{soma, post-shunt}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{syn, eff}}}{g_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{soma, pre-shunt}} \\cdot g_L}{g_L + g_{\\text{inh}}}$$\nThis equation shows that the shunting inhibition acts as a voltage divider, scaling the preshunt voltage by the factor $g_L / (g_L + g_{\\text{inh}})$.\nSubstituting the given conductance values ($g_L = 10 \\text{ nS}$, $g_{\\text{inh}} = 20 \\text{ nS}$):\n$$\\frac{g_L}{g_L + g_{\\text{inh}}} = \\frac{10 \\text{ nS}}{10 \\text{ nS} + 20 \\text{ nS}} = \\frac{10}{30} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nTherefore, the voltage at the soma in the presence of shunting inhibition is:\n$$V_{\\text{soma, post-shunt}} = V_{\\text{soma, pre-shunt}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} (5.0 \\text{ mV}) \\exp(-2.4)$$\n\n**Step 3: Attenuation from the Soma to the AIS**\nThis somatic voltage, $V_{\\text{soma, post-shunt}}$, then propagates passively down the axon to the AIS. We apply the cable equation again, this time using the axonal parameters. The starting voltage is $V_{\\text{soma, post-shunt}}$, the distance is $x_{\\text{axon}} = 40$ $\\mu$m, and the axonal length constant is $\\lambda_{\\text{axon}} = 200$ $\\mu$m.
