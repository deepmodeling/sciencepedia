We can quantify this sensitivity using the Boltzmann model, which describes the probability of a channel's voltage sensor being in a permissive state. This exercise connects the phenomenological 'slope factor' ($k$) from experimental data to a core physical property: the effective gating charge ($z$). By working through this problem, you will learn to interpret the steepness of a channel's activation curve not just as a shape, but as a direct measure of how strongly the channel responds to changes in membrane potential.", "problem": "A voltage-clamp experiment is performed on a neuron expressing two voltage-gated potassium channel subtypes: a delayed rectifier and an A-type (transient) channel. For each subtype, the steady-state activation curve (normalized conductance versus voltage) is well described by a two-state equilibrium model in which the open and closed states are separated by a voltage-dependent free energy difference. Assume that at equilibrium the ratio of open to closed probabilities follows the Boltzmann distribution and that the free energy difference depends linearly on membrane voltage through an effective gating charge. Specifically, assume the following fundamental base:\n- The Boltzmann distribution of state occupancies at equilibrium, with ratio of probabilities given by $\\exp(-\\Delta G/RT)$, where $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is absolute temperature, and $\\Delta G$ is the free energy difference between states.\n- Linear electrostatic coupling of gating to membrane voltage, such that $\\Delta G(V) = \\Delta G_{0} - z F V$, where $z$ is the effective gating charge (in units of the elementary charge), $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $V$ is membrane voltage.\n- The macroscopic conductance at a given voltage is proportional to the open probability, $g(V) = g_{\\max} \\, P_{\\mathrm{open}}(V)$, where $g_{\\max}$ is the maximal conductance.\n\nAt $T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$, the measured activation curves yield the following slope factors (defined operationally from the Boltzmann fit as the voltage scale over which the odds of opening versus closing change by a factor of $e$ near half-activation): for the A-type channel, $k_{A} = 7\\ \\mathrm{mV}$; for the delayed rectifier, $k_{D} = 12\\ \\mathrm{mV}$. Use $RT/F \\approx 25.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ at $T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n\nWhich of the following statements are correct under the two-state equilibrium gating framework above?\n\nA. The effective gating charge for the A-type channel exceeds that of the delayed rectifier, and a consistent numerical estimate for the A-type is $z_{A} \\approx 3.7$.\n\nB. Increasing temperature (with no change in effective gating charge) will steepen the activation curve (decrease the slope factor), because thermal energy makes voltage dependence stronger.\n\nC. A shift of the half-activation voltage to more depolarized values with no change in slope factor implies a change in the voltage-independent free energy offset between closed and open states, but not in the effective gating charge.\n\nD. If a point mutation doubles the effective gating charge while leaving all other properties unchanged, the slope factor will also double.\n\nE. Delayed rectifier channels generally have smaller slope factors than A-type channels because they activate more slowly, and the slope factor quantifies activation speed rather than voltage sensitivity.\n\nSelect all that apply.", "solution": "From the problem statement, the probability of a channel being open, $P_{\\mathrm{open}}$, follows a Boltzmann distribution based on the free energy difference $\\Delta G(V)$:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{open}}(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G(V)}{RT}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_0 - zFV}{RT}\\right)} $$\nThis equation is commonly written in a phenomenological form using the half-activation voltage ($V_{1/2}$) and a slope factor ($k$):\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{open}}(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V - V_{1/2}}{k}\\right)} $$\nBy comparing the terms that multiply the voltage $V$ in the exponents of both forms, we can derive the relationship between the physical gating charge ($z$) and the descriptive slope factor ($k$):\n$$ -\\frac{zF}{RT} = -\\frac{1}{k} \\implies k = \\frac{RT}{zF} $$\nThis fundamental relationship shows that the slope factor $k$ is inversely proportional to the effective gating charge $z$. A smaller slope factor implies a steeper activation curve and a larger gating charge. Given the thermal voltage $RT/F \\approx 25.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}$, we can calculate the gating charge as $z \\approx \\frac{25.7}{k}$.\n\nNow we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. Correct.** The A-type channel has a smaller slope factor ($k_{A} = 7\\ \\mathrm{mV}$) than the delayed rectifier ($k_{D} = 12\\ \\mathrm{mV}$). Since $z$ is inversely proportional to $k$, the A-type channel must have a larger effective gating charge ($z_A > z_D$). We can calculate the value for the A-type channel: $z_A \\approx \\frac{25.7\\ \\mathrm{mV}}{7\\ \\mathrm{mV}} \\approx 3.67$. The estimate $z_{A} \\approx 3.7$ is correct.\n\n**B. Incorrect.** The relationship is $k = \\frac{RT}{zF}$. If temperature $T$ increases, the slope factor $k$ will also increase. An increased slope factor means the activation curve becomes broader (less steep), not steeper.\n\n**C. Correct.** The slope factor $k = \\frac{RT}{zF}$ is determined by the gating charge $z$ (at constant temperature). If the slope factor is unchanged, the gating charge $z$ must also be unchanged. The half-activation voltage is the voltage where $\\Delta G = 0$, which gives $V_{1/2} = \\frac{\\Delta G_0}{zF}$. If $V_{1/2}$ shifts while $z$ remains constant, it must be due to a change in $\\Delta G_0$, the voltage-independent component of the free energy.\n\n**D. Incorrect.** Because $k$ is inversely proportional to $z$, if a mutation doubles the effective gating charge ($z \\rightarrow 2z$), the slope factor will be halved ($k \\rightarrow k/2$), not doubled.\n\n**E. Incorrect.** This statement is flawed for two reasons. First, based on the problem's data, the delayed rectifier has a *larger* slope factor than the A-type channel, not smaller. Second, the slope factor $k$ is a measure of steady-state voltage sensitivity (an equilibrium property related to gating charge), not the speed of channel activation (a kinetic property).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "5051797"}, {"introduction": "Having explored how to quantify channel properties, we now turn to how these properties arise from the channel's molecular structure. This practice presents a thought experiment that mirrors classic molecular biology studies, focusing on the famous \"ball-and-chain\" model of N-type inactivation.

This exercise is designed to strengthen your ability to reason from structure to function, predicting how a change at the protein level transforms both the biophysical current (in voltage clamp) and the neuron's firing behavior (in current clamp), thereby clarifying the essential difference between transient and sustained potassium currents.", "problem": "A-type potassium channels are transient outward $\\mathrm{K}^+$ channels that exhibit rapid N-type inactivation mediated by an N-terminal \"ball-and-chain\" domain. In the Hodgkin–Huxley (HH) formalism, a voltage-gated $\\mathrm{K}^+$ current can be represented as $I_{K}(t) = \\bar{g}_{K}\\, m(t)^{p}\\, h(t)\\, (V - E_{K})$, where $\\bar{g}_{K}$ is the maximal conductance, $m(t)$ is the activation gate, $h(t)$ is the inactivation gate, $p$ is the activation gate cooperativity, $V$ is membrane voltage, and $E_{K}$ is the potassium reversal potential. For a prototypical A-type channel, $m(t)$ activates quickly with a small time constant and $h(t)$ inactivates rapidly with a small time constant, producing a transient outward current for steps to depolarized voltages, with steady-state inactivation $h_{\\infty}(V)$ strongly reducing availability for depolarized holding potentials.\n\nConsider a neuron expressing an A-type channel with $\\bar{g}_{A}$ that follows $I_{A}(t) = \\bar{g}_{A}\\, m(t)^{p}\\, h(t)\\, (V - E_{K})$, where $p$ is a positive integer and $E_{K} \\approx -90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Under voltage clamp, stepping from a holding potential of $-80\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to $-10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ evokes a peak outward current that decays nearly to zero within tens of milliseconds due to inactivation. Now suppose the channel is mutated by an N-terminal truncation that removes the inactivation domain, eliminating fast N-type inactivation but leaving the pore selectivity and activation machinery intact.\n\nUsing the HH description and standard biophysical principles (Ohm’s law for ionic currents and gating-variable kinetics), predict the combined impact of this truncation in both voltage clamp and current clamp. In particular, reason from the gating formalism about how the time course of $I_{K}(t)$ will change when $h(t)$ is abolished, what happens to the steady-state inactivation curve $h_{\\infty}(V)$, whether the reversal potential $E_{K}$ should change, and how sustained depolarizing current injection is expected to alter action potential (AP) properties and repetitive firing compared to the wild-type A-type channel. Select the single option that best captures the overall phenotype shift toward a delayed rectifier (DR) behavior.\n\nA. In voltage clamp, the outward current becomes sustained and non-inactivating at depolarized voltages with $I_{K}(t) \\approx \\bar{g}_{A}\\, m(t)^{p}\\, (V - E_{K})$; the steady-state inactivation curve $h_{\\infty}(V)$ is abolished (effectively $h \\equiv 1$); $E_{K}$ is unchanged. In current clamp, the persistent $\\mathrm{K}^+$ conductance during maintained depolarization shortens AP duration (faster repolarization), increases rheobase, and reduces repetitive firing, consistent with conversion toward a delayed rectifier phenotype.\n\nB. In voltage clamp, peak current is reduced and decay remains, but with a slower inactivation time course; $E_{K}$ shifts to less negative values due to loss of the inactivation domain. In current clamp, excitability increases because removal of inactivation eliminates the initial spike delay, leading to earlier and higher firing rates.\n\nC. In voltage clamp, the current reverses direction and becomes inward at depolarized voltages because removal of the inactivation domain changes ion selectivity; $E_{K}$ shifts positively. In current clamp, APs are prolonged due to reduced $\\mathrm{K}^+$ efflux and firing rate increases.\n\nD. In voltage clamp, the outward current becomes partially sustained but the steady-state inactivation curve $h_{\\infty}(V)$ simply shifts to more negative voltages instead of being abolished; $E_{K}$ is unchanged. In current clamp, removal of inactivation increases bursting and afterdepolarizations by reducing repolarizing drive during maintained depolarization.\n\nE. In voltage clamp, activation becomes markedly slower and requires stronger depolarization because the N-terminal domain was necessary for opening; $E_{K}$ is unchanged. In current clamp, APs broaden and firing accelerates due to reduced outward currents at depolarized potentials.", "solution": "The mutation removes the N-terminal \"ball\" domain responsible for fast N-type inactivation, while leaving the voltage-sensing and pore domains intact. In the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism, this is equivalent to removing the inactivation gate variable, $h(t)$, or permanently setting it to 1.\n\nThe current equation for the channel transforms from its wild-type form:\n$$ I_{A, \\text{wild-type}}(t) = \\bar{g}_{A}\\, m(t)^{p}\\, h(t)\\, (V - E_{K}) $$\nto the mutant form:\n$$ I_{A, \\text{mutant}}(t) = \\bar{g}_{A}\\, m(t)^{p}\\, (1)\\, (V - E_{K}) = \\bar{g}_{A}\\, m(t)^{p}\\, (V - E_{K}) $$\nThis new equation describes a current that activates with depolarization (as governed by $m(t)$) but no longer inactivates.

It will become a sustained outward current that persists for the duration of the stimulus.\n*   **Steady-State Inactivation:** Since the inactivation mechanism has been physically removed, the concept of steady-state inactivation is abolished. The steady-state inactivation variable, $h_{\\infty}(V)$, is effectively fixed at 1 for all voltages.\n*   **Reversal Potential ($E_K$):** The problem states that pore selectivity remains intact. Therefore, the reversal potential, which is determined by ion selectivity and concentration gradients, is unchanged.\n\n**Current Clamp Analysis:**\nThe mutated channel now contributes a sustained outward K$^+$ current whenever the membrane is depolarized above its activation threshold. This persistent current acts as a powerful brake on excitability.\n*   **Action Potential (AP) Duration:** The additional sustained outward current during the AP's falling phase will accelerate repolarization, resulting in a shorter AP duration.\n*   **Rheobase:** To reach the firing threshold, a depolarizing stimulus must now overcome this new, persistent outward current. This means a larger stimulus current is required, so the rheobase increases.\n*   **Repetitive Firing:** The sustained outward current will remain active as long as the cell is depolarized, making it more difficult for the membrane potential to return to threshold after each spike. This will slow down the firing rate or prevent repetitive firing altogether.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n*   **A. Correct.** This option accurately describes all the consequences derived above: a sustained, non-inactivating current in voltage clamp with an unchanged $E_K$; and in current clamp, shorter APs, increased rheobase, and reduced repetitive firing. This represents a classic conversion to a delayed rectifier phenotype.\n*   **B. Incorrect.** Excitability decreases, not increases. Inactivation is eliminated, not just slowed. $E_K$ is unchanged.\n*   **C. Incorrect.** Ion selectivity is unchanged, so the current remains an outward K$^+$ current at depolarized potentials. APs are shortened, not prolonged.\n*   **D. Incorrect.** Inactivation is abolished, not just shifted. The resulting sustained current suppresses excitability, it does not increase bursting.\n*   **E. Incorrect.** The activation machinery is stated to be intact. The mutation leads to a larger *sustained* outward current, which decelerates firing.

This requires a half-activation voltage ($V_{1/2}$) near the spike threshold.\n2.  **Preserve Steady Firing:** The current must be transient. It must inactivate on a timescale of tens of milliseconds so that it is largely absent during the interspike intervals of later spikes in a train. This requires a relatively short inactivation time constant ($\\tau_h$).\n3.  **Maintain Resting State:** The current must be negligible at the resting membrane potential (~-65 mV) to avoid altering the cell's baseline state. This requires the $V_{1/2}$ to be significantly more depolarized than the resting potential. Additionally, the current's reversal potential ($E_K$) must match the physiological Nernst potential for potassium (~-85 mV).\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on these principles:\n\n**A.

Incorrect.** A $V_{1/2}$ of -30 mV is too depolarized. It is well above the spike threshold. The current will not activate in the subthreshold range and therefore cannot delay the onset of the first spike.\n\n**C. Incorrect.** This option violates two constraints. A $V_{1/2}$ of -70 mV is more negative than the resting potential, which will cause the channel to be active at rest, creating a standing outward current that hyperpolarizes the cell. A $\\tau_h$ of 100 ms is too long, making the current quasi-sustained and causing it to suppress the overall firing rate, not just the first spike.\n\n**D. Incorrect.** Setting $E_K = -60\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ is biophysically incorrect, as it does not match the neuron's Nernst potential for potassium. This incorrect reversal potential would drastically reduce the outward driving force in the subthreshold range, making the current less effective at opposing depolarization.
