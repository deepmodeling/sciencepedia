The full system is a set of four coupled first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the state variables $V(t)$, $m(t)$, $h(t)$, and $n(t)$.\n\nA fundamental property of systems described by first-order ODEs with finite-valued right-hand sides is that their state variables must be continuous functions of time. The applied external current $I_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t) = I_{0}\\,H(t)$ has a finite step discontinuity at $t=0$, but it is not an impulse (i.e., a Dirac delta function). Consequently, the derivative $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ will experience a jump discontinuity, but the state variable $V(t)$ itself will be continuous across $t=0$. The same logic applies to the gating variables $m(t)$, $h(t)$, and $n(t)$, as their derivatives $\\frac{dm}{dt}$, $\\frac{dh}{dt}$, and $\\frac{dn}{dt}$ are continuous functions of $V(t)$, which is itself continuous.\n\nTherefore, the values of all state variables immediately after the current injection at $t=0^{+}$ must be identical to their values immediately before, at $t=0^{-}$. The problem states that the system is at a steady resting state for $t  0$. Thus, we have:\n$$\nV(0^{+}) \\;=\\; V(0^{-}) \\;=\\; V_{\\mathrm{rest}}\n$$\n$$\nm(0^{+}) \\;=\\; m(0^{-}) \\;=\\; m_{\\mathrm{rest}}\n$$\n$$\nh(0^{+}) \\;=\\; h(0^{-}) \\;=\\; h_{\\mathrm{rest}}\n$$\n$$\nn(0^{+}) \\;=\\; n(0^{-}) \\;=\\; n_{\\mathrm{rest}}\n$$\n\nAt the resting state for $t0$, the neuron is in equilibrium with no external current ($I_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t)=0$). This implies that all time derivatives are zero. From the voltage dynamics equation, we have:\n$$\n\\left.

The initial change in voltage is determined solely by the amplitude of the injected current and the membrane capacitance, independent of the complex ionic conductances. This is why the requested answer only depends on $I_0$ and $C$.\n\nNow, we address the second part of the question regarding linearization and the role of the effective input conductance a rest. Let's define the perturbations from rest as $v(t) = V(t) - V_{\\mathrm{rest}}$, $\\delta_m(t) = m(t) - m_{\\mathrm{rest}}$, and so on.

The term $\\frac{\\partial I_{\\mathrm{ion}}}{\\partial V}|_{\\mathrm{rest}}$ is the effective input conductance at rest. Let's call it $g_{\\mathrm{rest}}$:\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{rest}} = \\left.\\frac{\\partial I_{\\mathrm{ion}}}{\\partial V}\\right|_{\\mathrm{rest}} = g_{\\mathrm{Na}}\\,m_{\\mathrm{rest}}^{3}h_{\\mathrm{rest}} + g_{\\mathrm{K}}\\,n_{\\mathrm{rest}}^{4} + g_{\\mathrm{L}}\n$$\nThis conductance $g_{\\mathrm{rest}}$ represents the instantaneous total conductance of the membrane when its gates are in the resting configuration. It enters the linearized dynamics as the coefficient of the voltage perturbation term $v(t)$:\n$$\nC\\,\\frac{dv}{dt} = -g_{\\mathrm{rest}}\\,v - \\dots + I_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t)\n$$\nThe term $-g_{\\mathrm{rest}}\\,v$ represents a passive, Ohmic current that opposes deviations from the resting potential. It is a key factor in determining the membrane's subthreshold voltage response and its time constant $\\tau = C/g_{\\mathrm{rest}}$ for times $t  0$.\n\nHowever, to compute the initial slope $\\left.\\frac{dV}{dt}\\right|_{t=0^{+}}$, we evaluate the linearized equation at $t=0^{+}$. As established by the continuity principle, at this precise moment, the perturbations have not yet developed: $v(0^{+})=0$, $\\delta_m(0^{+})=0$, $\\delta_h(0^{+})=0$, and $\\delta_n(0^{+})=0$. Substituting these into the linearized equation:\n$$\n\\left. C\\,\\frac{dv}{dt} \\right|_{t=0^{+}} = -g_{\\mathrm{rest}}\\cdot(0) - (\\dots)(0) + I_{0} = I_{0}\n$$\nSince $\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{dV}{dt}$, this confirms the result $\\left.\\frac{dV}{dt}\\right|_{t=0^{+}} = \\frac{I_{0}}{C}$. Thus, while the effective input conductance at rest, $g_{\\mathrm{rest}}$, is crucial for describing the voltage dynamics for $t  0$, it does not affect the value of the initial slope at the exact moment of stimulation, $t=0}^{+}$.

Since $I_{Na}$ is negative (an inward current of positive ions), a positive derivative means $I_{Na}$ is becoming less negative (i.e., its magnitude is decreasing). This represents the inactivation of sodium channels, which reduces the depolarizing drive that created the upstroke. This contributes to the termination of the voltage rise.\n- The sign of $dI_{K}/dt$ is positive. Since $I_{K}$ is positive (an outward current of positive ions), a positive derivative means $I_{K}$ is becoming more positive (i.e., its magnitude is increasing). This represents the activation of potassium channels, which strengthens the repolarizing drive. This also contributes to the termination of the voltage rise and initiates the fall.\nBoth of these effects—the reduction of the inward sodium current and the increase of the outward potassium current—work together to halt the depolarization and initiate repolarization. They are the mechanisms that define the peak of the action potential. Consequently, both effects contribute to *narrowing* the width of the action potential peak by ensuring a swift transition from the rising phase to the falling phase.\n\nThe final answer requires encoding these signs as $+1$ for positive.

This is equivalent to finding the time at which the slower of the two recovery processes reaches its threshold. Therefore, the ISI is the maximum of the two individual minimum times:\n$$\n\\text{ISI} = \\max(t_h, t_n) = \\max\\left(7\\ln(5), 10\\ln\\left(\\frac{0.483}{0.183}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nWe now compute the numerical values of $t_h$ and $t_n$ in milliseconds:\n$$\nt_h = 7\\ln(5) \\approx 7 \\times 1.6094379 \\approx 11.266065\\,\\text{ms}\n$$\n$$\nt_n = 10\\ln\\left(\\frac{0.483}{0.183}\\right) \\approx 10\\ln(2.639344) \\approx 10 \\times 0.970550 \\approx 9.70550\\,\\text{ms}\n$$\nComparing the two values, we find that $t_h  t_n$.
