The total current crossing the membrane is the sum of the capacitive current, $I_C$, and the ionic leak current, $I_L$. This sum must be equal to the externally applied injected current, $I$.\n$$\nI = I_C + I_L\n$$\nThe capacitive current is defined by the relation $I_C = C_m \\frac{dV}{dt}$, where $C_m$ is the membrane capacitance and $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ is the rate of change of the membrane potential.\nThe ionic leak current, $I_L$, is given as ohmic with a conductance $g_L$ and a reversal potential equal to $V_{rest}$. Thus, its form is $I_L = g_L (V - V_{rest})$.\nSubstituting these expressions into the current balance equation yields the governing differential equation for the membrane potential:\n$$\nI = C_m \\frac{dV}{dt} + g_L (V - V_{rest})\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation.\n\nThe problem asks for the steady-state membrane voltage, which we denote as $V_{ss}$. In the steady state, the membrane potential is constant, which implies that its time derivative is zero: $\\frac{dV}{dt} = 0$.

We apply this definition to our steady-state solution for $V$. The steady-state voltage is $V_{ss}$, so we compute the partial derivative of $V_{ss}$ with respect to $I$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V_{ss}}{\\partial I} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial I} \\left( V_{rest} + \\frac{I}{g_L} \\right)\n$$\nSince $V_{rest}$ and $g_L$ are constants with respect to the injected current $I$, the derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V_{ss}}{\\partial I} = \\frac{1}{g_L}\n$$\nBy the definition given, this derivative is the input resistance $R_{in}$. Therefore, we have the fundamental relationship:\n$$\nR_{in} = \\frac{1}{g_L}\n$$\nNow, we can substitute this back into the expression for $V_{ss}$:\n$$\nV_{ss} = V_{rest} + I \\left(\\frac{1}{g_L}\\right) = V_{rest} + I R_{in}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the steady-state membrane voltage under constant current injection, expressed in terms of $V_{rest}$, $I$, and $R_{in}$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the minimal constant current, $I_{min}$, required such that the steady-state voltage meets or exceeds a fixed threshold $V_{\\theta}$.
