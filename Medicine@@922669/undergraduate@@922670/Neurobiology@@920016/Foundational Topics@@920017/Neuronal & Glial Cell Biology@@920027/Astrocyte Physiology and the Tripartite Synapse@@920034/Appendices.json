This conclusion is reached by analyzing the different timescale and concentration regimes that govern AMPA and NMDA receptor activation, and how astrocytic transporters influence them.\n\n**1. Analysis of Postsynaptic Density (PSD) AMPA Receptor Saturation**\n\n*   **Timescale and Concentration:** Following vesicular release, the glutamate concentration within the synaptic cleft peaks in the millimolar range ($\\sim1-10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$) within microseconds. AMPA receptors, located on the PSD, are exposed to this transient.\n*   **Receptor Kinetics:** AMPA receptors have a relatively low affinity (half-activation in the hundreds of micromolar to millimolar range) but activate extremely rapidly (sub-millisecond). The peak synaptic glutamate concentration far exceeds their half-activation level, causing them to saturate.\n*   **Transporter Influence:** Astrocytic glutamate transporters have a turnover time on the order of milliseconds. They are also located at the edge of the cleft, at least $50\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ away. Therefore, they are too slow and too far away to significantly affect the initial, sub-millisecond, high-concentration glutamate peak that saturates the AMPA receptors *within* the cleft.\n*   **Conclusion:** Because the saturation of PSD AMPA receptors is determined by the near-instantaneous peak glutamate concentration before transporters can act, changing the astrocyte distance from $50\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ to $200\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ has little to no systematic effect on this process.\n\n**2. Analysis of Extrasynaptic NMDA Receptor Activation**\n\n*   **Glutamate Spillover:** \"Spillover\" refers to glutamate that diffuses out of the synaptic cleft into the surrounding extrasynaptic space. The concentration and duration of this extrasynaptic glutamate transient are primarily limited by uptake via astrocytic transporters.\n*   **Role of Astrocyte Proximity:**\n    *   In **configuration 1** ($50\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ distance), the dense wall of transporters on the astrocyte acts as a highly efficient barrier, rapidly binding and clearing glutamate that escapes the cleft. This minimizes both the spatial spread and temporal duration of the spillover signal.\n    *   In **configuration 2** ($200\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ distance), the astrocyte is retracted. Glutamate that spills over now travels further and persists longer in the extracellular space before it can be cleared by the transporters. This results in a glutamate transient that is higher in concentration and longer-lasting in the extrasynaptic space compared to the first configuration.\n*   **Receptor Kinetics:** Extrasynaptic NMDA receptors are well-suited to detect this spillover signal. They have a high affinity for glutamate (half-activation in the low micromolar range) and slower kinetics, allowing them to integrate this weaker, more prolonged signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** By increasing the astrocyte-synapse distance, the efficiency of glutamate clearance from the perisynaptic environment is reduced. This leads to enhanced glutamate spillover, resulting in greater activation of high-affinity extrasynaptic NMDA receptors.\n\nCombining these two points directly leads to prediction B: AMPA receptor saturation is largely unchanged, while spillover-mediated extrasynaptic NMDA activation increases.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4999249"}]}
