The problem defines velocity, $v$, as displacement per unit time. For a contiguous run, the displacement is the run length, $L$, and the time is the run time, $T$. The relationship is:\n$$v = \\frac{L}{T}$$\nTo find the mean run time $T$, we rearrange this equation:\n$$T = \\frac{L}{v}$$\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values. The units of length ($\\mu\\text{m}$) in $L$ and $v$ are consistent, so they will cancel, leaving units of seconds.

It provides a simplified but standard biophysical model of axonal transport known as the \"tug-of-war\" model. The data and assumptions are self-contained and consistent, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. The values for motor stall forces are within experimentally accepted ranges. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a full solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the likely direction of motion of an axonal vesicle and to compute the signed net excess stall force acting upon it. The vesicle is subject to forces from two opposing teams of molecular motors: plus-end-directed kinesin-1 and minus-end-directed cytoplasmic dynein.\n\nLet us define the variables and constants as provided:\n- Number of kinesin-1 motors: $N_k = 2$.\n- Stall force of a single kinesin-1 motor: $F_k = 6\\,\\text{pN}$.\n- Number of cytoplasmic dynein motors: $N_d = 3$.\n- Stall force of a single dynein motor: $F_d = 1.2\\,\\text{pN}$.\n\nThe problem establishes a sign convention where the plus-end (anterograde) direction is positive. Therefore, forces generated by kinesin motors are positive, and forces generated by dynein motors are negative.\n\nAccording to the model's assumption (ii), the forces generated by motors within a team sum linearly. Thus, we can calculate the total stall capacity for each team. The total stall capacity of a team represents the maximum force that team can generate in its preferred direction.\n\nThe total stall capacity of the plus-end-directed kinesin team, $F_{\\text{team}, k}$, is the product of the number of kinesin motors and the stall force per motor:\n$$F_{\\text{team}, k} = N_k \\times F_k$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$F_{\\text{team}, k} = 2 \\times 6\\,\\text{pN} = 12\\,\\text{pN}$$\n\nThe total stall capacity of the minus-end-directed dynein team, $F_{\\text{team}, d}$, is the product of the number of dynein motors and the stall force per motor:\n$$F_{\\text{team}, d} = N_d \\times F_d$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$F_{\\text{team}, d} = 3 \\times 1.2\\,\\text{pN} = 3.6\\,\\text{pN}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the \"signed net excess stall force,\" which is explicitly defined as \"the total plus-end team stall capacity minus the total minus-end team stall capacity.\" Let us denote this quantity as $F_{\\text{excess}}$. Applying the sign convention, the kinesin team's capacity is positive and the dynein team's capacity is effectively a negative contribution to the net force, though the definition asks for the difference of their magnitudes.\n$$F_{\\text{excess}} = F_{\\text{team}, k} - F_{\\text{team}, d}$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated total stall capacities:\n$$F_{\\text{excess}} = 12\\,\\text{pN} - 3.6\\,\\text{pN} = 8.4\\,\\text{pN}$$\n\nAccording to assumption (iv), the vesicle's inertia is negligible, and the instantaneous direction of motion is determined by the sign of the net motor-generated force. In this tug-of-war model, the net force is represented by the signed net excess stall force.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the long-time average velocity, $v_{\\text{avg}}$, for a cargo undergoing a repetitive cycle of movement and pausing. For a process that is periodic or repeats as a steady cycle, the long-time average velocity is equivalent to the average velocity over a single representative cycle.\n\nA single cycle consists of two distinct phases:\n1.  A burst phase of duration $t_b$, during which the cargo moves at a constant velocity $v_b$.\n2.  A pause phase of duration $t_p$, during which the cargo has zero net displacement.\n\nThe total duration of one complete cycle, $\\Delta t_{\\text{cycle}}$, is the sum of the durations of the burst and pause phases:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{cycle}} = t_b + t_p\n$$\n\nThe total displacement during one cycle, $\\Delta x_{\\text{cycle}}$, is the sum of the displacements in each phase. The displacement during the burst phase, $\\Delta x_b$, is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta x_b = v_b \\times t_b\n$$\nThe displacement during the pause phase is given as $0$.
