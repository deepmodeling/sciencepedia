The specific membrane resistance, denoted $R_{m}$, is defined as the membrane resistance normalized by area, so that identical membrane patches contribute conductances in parallel when considered as a whole cell. Starting from the definitions that (i) resistance adds in parallel as conductance ($G$) sums, where $G = 1/R$, and (ii) specific membrane resistance $R_{m}$ is the resistance per unit area, derive the expression for the whole-cell input resistance $R_{\\text{in}}$ of an isopotential astrocyte in terms of $R_{m}$ and the total surface area $A$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of cellular electrophysiology, specifically the passive properties of cell membranes modeled using Ohm's law. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two parts: first, a derivation of the whole-cell input resistance, $R_{\\text{in}}$, in terms of specific membrane resistance, $R_m$, and total surface area, $A$; and second, a calculation of $R_{\\text{in}}$ for given values.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for $R_{\\text{in}}$. The cell membrane is modeled as a collection of infinitesimally small membrane patches, each with area $dA$. The problem states that the conductances of these patches add in parallel. The total input conductance of the cell, $G_{\\text{in}}$, is therefore the sum (i.e., the integral) of the conductances of all these small patches over the entire surface area of the cell.\n$$G_{\\text{in}} = \\int_{\\text{surface}} dG$$\nwhere $dG$ is the conductance of a single patch of area $dA$.\n\nThe specific membrane resistance, $R_m$, is given with units of resistance multiplied by area (e.g., $\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^{2}$). This means that for a uniform patch of membrane of area $A'$, its resistance $R'$ is given by the relation $R' = R_m / A'$. Consequently, the conductance $G'$ of that patch is $G' = 1/R' = A'/R_m$. This relationship is fundamental.\n\nFor an infinitesimal patch of area $dA$, its resistance is $dR = R_m/dA$, and its conductance is therefore:\n$$dG = \\frac{1}{dR} = \\frac{dA}{R_m}$$\nTo find the total conductance of the cell, $G_{\\text{in}}$, we integrate $dG$ over the total surface area, $A$. The assumption that the astrocyte is isopotential and has uniform membrane properties means that $R_m$ is constant over the entire surface.\n$$G_{\\text{in}} = \\int_{A} \\frac{dA}{R_m} = \\frac{1}{R_m} \\int_{A} dA$$\nThe integral of $dA$ over the total surface is simply the total surface area, $A$.\n$$G_{\\text{in}} = \\frac{A}{R_m}$$\nThe whole-cell input resistance, $R_{\\text{in}}$, is the reciprocal of the total input conductance, $G_{\\text{in}}$.\n$$R_{\\text{in}} = \\frac{1}{G_{\\text{in}}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $G_{\\text{in}}$, we arrive at the desired relationship:\n$$R_{\\text{in}} = \\frac{R_m}{A}$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNext, we calculate the numerical value of $R_{\\text{in}}$ using the provided data:\nSpecific membrane resistance, $R_m = 5\\,\\text{k}\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^{2}$.\nTotal surface area, $A = 20{,}000\\,\\mu\\text{m}^{2}$.\n\nTo use the formula, we must convert the units to be compatible.

The conversion factor between centimeters and micrometers is $1\\,\\text{cm} = 10^4\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.

A complete solution will be developed.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe problem requires a derivation from first principles. Let $x(t)$ represent the position of the action potential along the axon at time $t$. The instantaneous velocity, $v$, is defined as the derivative of position with respect to time:\n$$ v = \\frac{dx}{dt} $$\nTo determine the total time, $T$, required for the action potential to traverse a segment of length $L$, we can rearrange and integrate this expression. Separating the variables yields:\n$$ dt = \\frac{1}{v} dx $$\nWe integrate this expression over the length of the axon segment, from an initial position $x=0$ to a final position $x=L$. The corresponding time interval is from $t=0$ to $t=T$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{T} dt = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{1}{v} dx $$\nFor both the healthy and demyelinated cases, the problem provides a single velocity value, implying that the velocity is constant along the entire $2\\,\\text{cm}$ segment. Therefore, the term $\\frac{1}{v}$ is a constant and can be moved outside the integral:\n$$ T [1]_{0}^{T} = \\frac{1}{v} \\int_{0}^{L} dx $$\n$$ T = \\frac{1}{v} [x]_{0}^{L} = \\frac{1}{v} (L - 0) = \\frac{L}{v} $$\nThis derivation from first principles confirms the standard kinematic formula relating time, distance, and constant velocity.\n\nWe now apply this result to calculate the conduction times for the healthy and demyelinated cases. The given parameters must be in consistent units. We convert the length $L$ to meters:\n$L = 2\\,\\text{cm} = 0.02\\,\\text{m}$.\nThe given velocities are $v_h = 20\\,\\text{m/s}$ (healthy) and $v_d = 2\\,\\text{m/s}$ (demyelinated).\n\nThe conduction time for the healthy, myelinated axon, $T_h$, is:\n$$ T_h = \\frac{L}{v_h} = \\frac{0.02\\,\\text{m}}{20\\,\\text{m/s}} = 0.001\\,\\text{s} $$\nThe conduction time for the demyelinated axon, $T_d$, is:\n$$ T_d = \\frac{L}{v_d} = \\frac{0.02\\,\\text{m}}{2\\,\\text{m/s}} = 0.01\\,\\text{s} $$\nThe conduction delay introduced by demyelination, $\\Delta T$, is the difference between these two times:\n$$ \\Delta T = T_d - T_h $$\nSubstituting the symbolic expressions:\n$$ \\Delta T = \\frac{L}{v_d} - \\frac{L}{v_h} = L \\left( \\frac{1}{v_d} - \\frac{1}{v_h} \\right) $$\nWe can now insert the numerical values to compute the delay:\n$$ \\Delta T = 0.02\\,\\text{m} \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\,\\text{m/s}} - \\frac{1}{20\\,\\text{m/s}} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta T = 0.02 \\left( 0.5 - 0.05 \\right)\\,\\text{s} $$\n$$ \\Delta T = 0.02 \\left( 0.45 \\right)\\,\\text{s} $$\n$$ \\Delta T = 0.009\\,\\text{s} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures. To express $0.009$ with three significant figures, we write it as $0.00900$.\nTherefore, the total conduction delay is $0.00900\\,\\text{s}$.\n\n**Interpretation of the Result**\nAn additional delay of $\\Delta T = 0.00900\\,\\text{s}$, or $9.00\\,\\text{ms}$, is highly significant in the context of neural processing, where timing is critical.\n$1$. **Impact on Visual Evoked Potential (VEP):** The VEP is an electrophysiological signal recorded from the scalp that reflects the processing of a visual stimulus by the brain. The latency of its components, such as the P100 wave which normally peaks around $100\\,\\text{ms}$ after the stimulus, is a direct measure of conduction time along the visual pathway. A delay of $9.00\\,\\text{ms}$ would cause a measurable and clinically significant increase in the P100 latency, a hallmark diagnostic criterion for demyelinating diseases affecting the optic nerve, like optic neuritis in multiple sclerosis.\n$2$. **Impact on Synchrony and Feature Integration:** Coherent visual perception requires the brain to bind together different features of an object (e.g., its color, shape, and motion), which are processed in parallel neural pathways. This \"binding\" process is thought to depend critically on the synchronous arrival of signals at higher-order cortical areas. If signals from one part of the visual field are delayed relative to others due to focal demyelination, this temporal synchrony is lost. This can impair complex visual functions, such as the perception of rapid motion and the correct integration of form and movement, leading to symptoms like blurred vision and difficulty tracking objects.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.00900}$$", "id": "5020834"}]}
