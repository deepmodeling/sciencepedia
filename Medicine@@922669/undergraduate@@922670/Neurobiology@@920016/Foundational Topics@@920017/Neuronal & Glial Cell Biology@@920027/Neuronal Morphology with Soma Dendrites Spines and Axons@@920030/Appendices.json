The overall approach consists of two main steps: first, determining the synaptic current injected into the dendrite, and second, determining how this current affects the membrane potential at the soma.\n\nThe current injected by the synapse into the dendrite, $I_{\\mathrm{syn}}$, is governed by Ohm's law.
