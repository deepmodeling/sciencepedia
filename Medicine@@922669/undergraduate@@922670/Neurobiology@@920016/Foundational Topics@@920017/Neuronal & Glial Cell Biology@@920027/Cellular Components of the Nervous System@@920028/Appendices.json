A solution will be generated.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the rate of ATP hydrolysis needed to maintain sodium ion homeostasis in a neuron firing at a constant frequency. The solution is derived by applying the principle of mass balance in conjunction with the known stoichiometry of the Na$^{+}$/K$^{+}$ ATPase pump.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the given quantities:\n- The firing frequency of the neuron is $f = 20\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, which is equivalent to $20\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- The net influx of sodium ions per action potential is $N_{AP} = 1.2 \\times 10^{9}$ ions.\n- The stoichiometry of the pump is $S = 3$, representing the number of sodium ions exported per molecule of ATP hydrolyzed.\n\nThe total rate of sodium ion influx, denoted as $R_{Na, influx}$, is the number of sodium ions entering the neuron per unit time. This is calculated by multiplying the firing frequency by the number of ions that enter during each action potential:\n$$R_{Na, influx} = f \\cdot N_{AP}$$\n\nAccording to assumption (i), the neuron is in a steady state. This implies that the rate of ion influx must be precisely balanced by an equal rate of ion efflux to maintain a constant intracellular ion concentration. The problem states that the Na$^{+}$/K$^{+}$ ATPase is the sole mechanism responsible for this efflux. Therefore, the rate of sodium export by the pump, $R_{Na, export}$, must equal the rate of sodium influx:\n$$R_{Na, export} = R_{Na, influx} = f \\cdot N_{AP}$$\n\nAccording to assumption (ii), the stoichiometry of the Na$^{+}$/K$^{+}$ ATPase is fixed. For every $S=3$ sodium ions ($Na^{+}$) exported, one molecule of ATP is hydrolyzed. Let $R_{ATP}$ be the rate of ATP hydrolysis in molecules per second. This rate is related to the rate of sodium export by the stoichiometric ratio $S$:\n$$R_{Na, export} = S \\cdot R_{ATP}$$\n\nWe can now solve for the required rate of ATP hydrolysis, $R_{ATP}$, by rearranging the stoichiometric relationship:\n$$R_{ATP} = \\frac{R_{Na, export}}{S}$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $R_{Na, export}$ from the mass balance condition, we derive the general expression for the ATP consumption rate required to maintain the sodium gradient:\n$$R_{ATP} = \\frac{f \\cdot N_{AP}}{S}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this expression to compute the final answer.\n- $f = 20\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $N_{AP} = 1.2 \\times 10^{9}$\n- $S = 3$\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$R_{ATP} = \\frac{(20\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (1.2 \\times 10^{9})}{3}$$\n$$R_{ATP} = \\frac{24 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{3}$$\n$$R_{ATP} = 8 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n\nThe result is a rate of $8 \\times 10^{9}$ molecules of ATP hydrolyzed per second.
