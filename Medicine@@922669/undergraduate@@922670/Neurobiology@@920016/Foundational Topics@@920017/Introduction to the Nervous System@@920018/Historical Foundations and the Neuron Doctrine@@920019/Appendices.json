This exercise challenges you to step into the shoes of a 19th-century neuroanatomist and evaluate the historical debate between the reticular theory and the neuron doctrine. By analyzing the observational limits and crucial insights of the era, you will synthesize the key arguments and evidence that established neurons as the discrete functional units of the nervous system [@problem_id:5024841].", "problem": "A nineteenth-century anatomist observes nervous tissue using then-standard light microscopy and notes extensive continuity of silver-impregnated fibers.

Given visible light $\\lambda \\approx 500$ nanometers and a high numerical aperture $\\mathrm{NA} \\approx 1.4$, the resolution limit $d$ is on the order of $200$ nanometers.

The reticular theory versus neuron doctrine debate was a central, historical scientific controversy. The provided \"foundational bases\" are all factually correct: Cell Theory is fundamental to biology; the Abbe diffraction limit is a core principle of optics, and the numerical values provided ($\\lambda \\approx 500$ nm, $\\mathrm{NA} \\approx 1.4$, $d \\approx 200$ nm) are standard and correctly calculated ($d \\approx 500 / (2 \\times 1.4) \\approx 178.6$ nm); the roles of the Golgi stain, degeneration experiments, and electron microscopy are all historically accurate. The statement is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It asks to identify the best critique from a list of options based on a clear set of provided facts. A unique and best solution can be determined through logical deduction and knowledge of the subject.\n- **Objective:** The language is precise, unbiased, and free of subjective claims. It describes a historical scenario and provides the scientific context needed for its analysis.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. It provides all necessary information to evaluate the historical and scientific merits of the competing theories and the evidence used to resolve the debate. There are no contradictions.\n- **Other Flaws:** The problem is not unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-formulated, historically and scientifically accurate question. I will now proceed with the solution derivation and option evaluation.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation and Option Analysis\nThe core task is to identify the critique that correctly balances two aspects: ($1$) the rational, evidence-based reasons for the reticular theory's plausibility at the time, and ($2$) the decisive evidence that led to its rejection in favor of the neuron doctrine.\n\n**1. Justification for Reticular Theory:**\nThe primary evidence for the reticular theory was observational. Using staining techniques like the silver nitrate methods available at the time, nervous tissue appeared as a dense, tangled net of fibers. The foundational basis regarding the Abbe diffraction limit provides the physical explanation. A typical synaptic cleft, the gap between two neurons, is approximately $20-40$ nanometers wide. A high-quality light microscope from that era, limited by diffraction, had a maximum resolution of $d \\approx 200$ nanometers. Since the gap between neurons ($20-40$ nm) is an order of magnitude smaller than the minimum resolvable distance ($~200$ nm), it was physically impossible to visualize the synaptic cleft. Therefore, observing an apparently continuous network and inferring a physical continuity (a syncytium) was a rational, albeit ultimately incorrect, conclusion based on the available data and instrumentation.\n\n**2. Evidence Favoring the Neuron Doctrine:**\nThe provided bases point to several lines of evidence championed by Santiago Ramón y Cajal, who is the principal figure associated with the neuron doctrine.\n- **Anatomical Evidence (Golgi Method):** Camillo Golgi himself invented the \"black reaction\" but interpreted its results as supporting the reticular theory. Cajal's critical insight was to use this same method, which stains only a small fraction of neurons, to trace individual cells from end to end. He meticulously documented that axons and dendrites had free endings (e.g., terminal boutons on axons, dendritic spines) and were not fused with neighboring cells.\n- **Developmental Evidence (Growth Cones):** Cajal's observations of developing nerve tissue revealed that axons terminate in a structure he named the growth cone, which appeared to be an independent, motile structure navigating its environment to form connections. This strongly suggested that neurons develop as individual units, not as parts of a pre-formed network.\n- **Pathological Evidence (Wallerian Degeneration):** When an axon is severed from its parent cell body, the distal segment degenerates. This experiment (Wallerian degeneration) demonstrates that the neuron is a single trophic and metabolic unit. If the nervous system were a true syncytium, nutrients and signals from the surrounding network might be expected to prevent or alter this distinct, compartmentalized degeneration.\n- **Definitive Confirmation (Electron Microscopy):** While Cajal's evidence was overwhelmingly convincing, the debate was not formally and visually settled until the development of the electron microscope in the mid-20th century. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) had the necessary resolution to directly visualize the synaptic cleft, showing a clear physical separation between the presynaptic and postsynaptic neuron membranes, thus providing incontrovertible proof for the neuron doctrine.\n\nA complete critique must incorporate these points.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Reticular theory arose as a rational inference from continuous-appearing preparations seen under light microscopy constrained by the Abbe limit, $d \\approx \\lambda/(2\\,\\mathrm{NA})$, which could not resolve synaptic clefts on the order of $20$-$40$ nanometers. However, careful application of the Golgi method by Santiago Ramón y Cajal revealed axonal endings that terminate as discrete boutons and developmental growth cones that do not fuse into a network; Wallerian degeneration demonstrated compartmentalized failure restricted to the distal axon; and later TEM showed apposed membranes separated by a synaptic cleft, confirming discrete, membrane-bounded neurons. While electrical coupling via gap junctions exists, it represents local exceptions and does not re-establish a global syncytium.**\n\nThis option is a textbook summary of the historical and scientific resolution of the debate. It correctly identifies the role of the Abbe limit in explaining the initial reticularist observations. It then accurately lists the multiple lines of evidence used by Cajal (anatomical, developmental, pathological) that supported neuronal discreteness. It correctly positions TEM as the final, definitive proof. Finally, it includes the sophisticated nuance that gap junctions exist but do not support the original global syncytium concept. This option aligns perfectly with the provided foundational bases and the derived analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Reticular theory lacked any empirical motivation and was a purely metaphysical claim. The Golgi method immediately proved neurons are discrete even before Cajal’s work, and electron microscopy was irrelevant to resolving the debate because synapses were already obvious in early light microscopy.**\n\nThis option contains multiple factual errors. The reticular theory was not metaphysical; it was based on empirical (though limited) observation. The Golgi method was invented by Golgi, a leading reticularist; it did not \"immediately prove\" discreteness, and certainly not before Cajal's work, which was the crucial interpretative step. The claim that synapses were \"obvious\" in light microscopy is a direct contradiction of optical physics (the Abbe limit) and historical fact. EM was critically relevant.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Reticular theory was defensible because of continuous fiber staining under light microscopy, but it was decisively refuted primarily by the discovery of the all-or-none action potential, since an all-or-none response can only occur if cells are fully discrete; therefore, electrophysiology alone settled the question without any need for ultrastructural evidence.**\n\nThis option misrepresents the key evidence. While electrophysiology (e.g., Sherrington's work on synaptic delay) provided important functional evidence for a gap between neurons, the debate was primarily anatomical. The \"decisive\" refutation in the minds of anatomists came from Cajal's work, confirmed by EM. The logical leap that all-or-none potentials *require* discrete cells is an oversimplification; syncytial tissues like cardiac muscle also exhibit all-or-none action potentials. The claim that electrophysiology *alone* settled the question and that ultrastructural evidence was not needed is historically false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Reticular theory was supported by silver staining that revealed continuous neurofibrils, but it was ultimately disproven when later silver stains demonstrated uninterrupted continuity throughout the central nervous system (CNS) that paradoxically made the network too uniform to be functional, forcing scientists to abandon the theory.**\n\nThis option is illogical and factually backward. The \"later silver stains\" (i.e., Cajal's use of the Golgi method) demonstrated the *opposite* of uninterrupted continuity—they showed free endings. The reasoning for abandoning the theory is nonsensical; a theory is not disproven by evidence that appears to confirm it \"too much.\"\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Reticular theory emerged due to fixation artifacts that interrupted true continuity; modern live imaging has revealed that neuronal processes are in fact continuous cytoplasm and synaptic clefts are artifacts of tissue shrinkage, meaning neuron doctrine is an artifact of preparation technique.**\n\nThis option promotes a thoroughly debunked, pseudoscientific claim. It inverts reality. The neuron doctrine is one of the most robustly confirmed principles in all of biology. Modern live imaging, super-resolution microscopy, and multiple EM techniques (including those designed to minimize artifacts, like freeze-fracture) have repeatedly and definitively confirmed the existence of discrete neurons and synaptic clefts. This statement is factually and scientifically baseless.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the analysis, Option A is the only choice that is historically accurate, scientifically sound, and comprehensive. It correctly captures the rationale for the reticular view's emergence and the multi-pronged evidence that led to its replacement by the neuron doctrine, exactly as requested by the problem statement and its foundational bases.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5024841"}, {"introduction": "A hallmark of a powerful scientific theory is its falsifiability—it must make predictions that could, in principle, be proven wrong. This thought experiment asks you to apply this principle to the neuron doctrine itself. Your task is to define the most rigorous experimental observation that would invalidate the doctrine's core tenet of neuronal discreteness, while still being consistent with the broader principles of cell theory, thereby sharpening your understanding of what the neuron doctrine fundamentally asserts [@problem_id:5024725].", "problem": "The neuron doctrine originated as a synthesis of observations and reasoning that the nervous system is composed of discrete cells, with each neuron bounded by its own plasma membrane and communicating with other neurons at specialized junctions. The core assumptions include the discreteness of neuronal units and the principle of dynamic polarization, whereby signals generally propagate from dendrites and soma to axons. The cell theory, established in general biology, holds that living organisms are composed of cells that are the fundamental units of life, that new cells arise from preexisting cells, and that each cell maintains its own cytoplasmic continuity bounded by a plasma membrane. Consider a defined brain region in a hypothetical, but biologically plausible, vertebrate where investigators suspect that neuronal organization may depart from canonical expectations. Your goal is to select, from the options below, the most rigorous, falsifiable criterion that, if observed, would invalidate the neuron doctrine specifically in that brain region while remaining consistent with the cell theory.

Communication occurs at specialized junctions. Key tenets are $1$) neuronal discreteness and $2$) the principle of dynamic polarization (signal flow generally from dendrites/soma to axons).\n- **Cell Theory:** Living organisms are composed of cells, which are the fundamental units of life. New cells arise from preexisting cells. Each cell has cytoplasmic continuity and is bounded by a plasma membrane.\n- **Scenario:** A hypothetical but biologically plausible vertebrate brain region where neuronal organization may deviate from the neuron doctrine.\n- **Objective:** Identify the most rigorous, falsifiable criterion from the given options that would invalidate the neuron doctrine for that region, while remaining consistent with the cell theory.\n- **Constraint Checklist for the Criterion:**\n    $1$. Must invalidate the neuron doctrine.\n    $2$. Must be consistent with the cell theory.\n    $3$. Must specify an observable state.\n    $4$. Must be testable with established methods.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is well-structured and scientifically grounded.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on two cornerstone theories of biology: the neuron doctrine and the cell theory. The historical and conceptual tension between the neuron doctrine and the reticular theory (which proposed a continuous network) is a valid and important topic in neurobiology. The experimental methods mentioned (intracellular injection, Transmission Electron Microscopy) are standard and appropriate for investigating cellular structure.\n- **Well-Posed:** The question is unambiguous. It requires finding the best option that satisfies a clear set of constraints, specifically to falsify one theory while upholding another. This requires a precise understanding of the core tenets of both theories.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal, precise, and free of subjective or non-scientific claims. The terms used are standard within the field of biology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It presents a clear, conceptual challenge rooted in fundamental biological principles. I will now proceed to derive the solution and evaluate the options.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\nThe core task is to identify an observation that would refute the most fundamental tenet of the neuron doctrine—that neurons are discrete, individual cells—while not violating the cell theory's definition of a cell.\n\nThe neuron doctrine posits a nervous system made of many individual cells. The most direct and profound falsification of this doctrine would be the demonstration that what appear to be many neurons are, in fact, not discrete cells but are anatomically continuous, forming a single, continuous cytoplasmic entity.\n\nThe cell theory states that the cell is the fundamental unit of life. However, the cell theory accommodates variations such as multinucleated cells, which are known as syncytia (e.g., skeletal muscle fibers) or coenocytes (in fungi and algae). A syncytium is a single cell, enclosed by a single plasma membrane, that contains multiple nuclei. Therefore, an observation of a large, multinucleated neuron-like structure would be classified as a single cell (a syncytium) and would thus be consistent with the cell theory. However, this same observation would fundamentally invalidate the neuron doctrine for that region, as the region would not be composed of a population of discrete neurons but rather one massive cell.\n\nWith this framework, each option is evaluated:\n\n**A. Demonstrate that all putative neuronal somata and processes within the region are enclosed by a single continuous plasma membrane and share one continuous cytoplasm. This is evidenced by intracellular injection of a membrane-impermeant tracer that fills every soma and process within the region without crossing any internal membrane boundary, combined with Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) showing no internal plasma membrane separations between nuclei or processes, establishing that the entire region is a single multinucleated cell.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option describes the definitive proof of a syncytium. If a single injected tracer fills a volume containing multiple nuclei and all associated processes, and this is confirmed at the ultrastructural level by TEM showing a complete absence of intervening plasma membranes, then the structure is unequivocally a single, multinucleated cell.\n- **Invalidates Neuron Doctrine?** Yes, absolutely. It directly refutes the core tenet of neuronal discreteness in the most fundamental way possible.\n- **Consistent with Cell Theory?** Yes. As explained above, a large multinucleated cell is a syncytium, a well-established cellular form consistent with the cell theory.\n- **Rigorous and Falsifiable Criterion?** Yes. It proposes a combination of two powerful, established techniques (tracer injection and TEM) to test a clear, falsifiable hypothesis. The description of the required evidence is exceptionally rigorous.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Demonstrate widespread electrical coupling via Gap Junctions (GJs), with dye-coupling of small molecules across many neurons and synchronous subthreshold potentials, indicating an electrical syncytium formed by extensive intercellular channels between distinct cells.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option describes an electrical syncytium. Gap junctions are channels that connect the cytoplasm of *adjacent, distinct cells*. The very existence of gap junctions presupposes that there are two separate cells, each with its own plasma membrane, that are being connected.\n- **Invalidates Neuron Doctrine?** No. This observation *reinforces* the neuron doctrine's tenet of cellular discreteness. While it complicates simple models of information processing by allowing direct electrical and chemical communication outside of classical synapses, it does not challenge the anatomical individuality of neurons.\n- **Consistent with Cell Theory?** Yes, this is a normal form of cell-cell communication.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Demonstrate that action potentials propagate with equal likelihood from dendrites to axons and from axons to dendrites within many neurons, indicating a breakdown of dynamic polarization while preserving discrete cellular boundaries and synaptic contacts.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option targets the principle of dynamic polarization, which is a secondary component of the neuron doctrine. Modern neuroscience has already documented numerous exceptions, such as back-propagating action potentials, without this leading to the abandonment of the neuron doctrine as a whole.\n- **Invalidates Neuron Doctrine?** Only a secondary aspect of it. It leaves the most fundamental tenet—the anatomical discreteness of neurons—completely intact. Therefore, it is not the most rigorous or fundamental invalidation possible.\n- **Consistent with Cell Theory?** Yes, signal propagation direction is a physiological property, not a structural one that would conflict with the cell theory.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Demonstrate direct cytoplasmic continuity between adjacent neurons at contact sites without any intervening plasma membrane, including passage of organelles across cell contacts, revealing an open protoplasmic network spanning multiple nuclei and somata.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option, like option A, describes a syncytial arrangement that would falsify the neuron doctrine. This is a description of the reticular theory, the historical alternative to the neuron doctrine. The observation of \"direct cytoplasmic continuity\" is the key feature.\n- **Invalidates Neuron Doctrine?** Yes, for the same reason as A, it refutes cellular discreteness.\n- **Consistent with Cell Theory?** Yes, this describes a syncytium, which is compatible with the cell theory.\n- **Comparison with A:** Both A and D describe conceptually similar findings. However, the question asks for the \"most rigorous, falsifiable *criterion*\". Option A is superior because it provides a more complete description of the experimental standard of proof required. It specifies a robust, two-part experimental test (tracer injection + confirmatory TEM) that constitutes a rigorous criterion for establishing the claim. Option D describes the finding itself (\"direct cytoplasmic continuity\") but is less specific about the rigorous experimental protocol required to prove it. Therefore, as a description of a *criterion*, option A is more complete and rigorous.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. While the described observation is a valid refutation, Option A provides a more rigorous description of the *criterion* for proving that observation.\n\nIn conclusion, Option A presents the most definitive and rigorously defined experimental criterion that would fundamentally invalidate the neuron doctrine while remaining entirely consistent with the cell theory.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5024725"}, {"introduction": "The neuron doctrine is not merely an anatomical rule; its establishment as a principle has profound consequences for understanding nervous system function. The discreteness of neurons allows for an incredible degree of structural and functional specialization, such as myelination. This practice connects the historical doctrine to modern biophysics by asking you to quantify how myelin, a specialization made possible by discrete cellular interactions, dramatically increases the conduction velocity of an action potential using the principles of cable theory [@problem_id:5024793].", "problem": "Consider a cylindrical axon modeled with classical cable theory. Use the following fundamental definitions from cable theory:\n\n1. The length constant is given by $$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_{m}}{r_{i}}},$$ where $r_{m}$ is the membrane resistance per unit length and $r_{i}$ is the axial (internal) resistance per unit length.\n2.

This implies that the ratio of velocities can be written as:\n$$ \\frac{v^{\\text{my}}}{v^{\\text{un}}} = \\frac{\\lambda^{\\text{my}} / \\tau^{\\text{my}}}{\\lambda^{\\text{un}} / \\tau^{\\text{un}}} = \\left(\\frac{\\lambda^{\\text{my}}}{\\lambda^{\\text{un}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\tau^{\\text{un}}}{\\tau^{\\text{my}}}\\right) $$\n\nFirst, we derive an expression for the length constant $$\\lambda$$ in terms of the specific parameters.\n$$ \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_m}{r_i}} $$\nSubstitute the definitions for $$r_m$$ and $$r_i$$:\n$$ \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m}/(2\\pi a)}{R_{i}/(\\pi a^{2})}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m}}{2\\pi a} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi a^{2}}{R_{i}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m}a}{2R_{i}}} $$\nSince the axon radius $$a$$ and internal resistivity $$R_i$$ are constant, $$\\lambda$$ is proportional to $$\\sqrt{R_m}$$. The ratio of the length constants is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda^{\\text{my}}}{\\lambda^{\\text{un}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{R_{m}^{\\text{my}}a / (2R_{i})}}{\\sqrt{R_{m}^{\\text{un}}a / (2R_{i})}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m}^{\\text{my}}}{R_{m}^{\\text{un}}}} $$\n\nNext, we find the ratio of the time constants. The time constant $$\\tau$$ is defined as:\n$$ \\tau = R_{m}C_{m} $$\nThe ratio of the unmyelinated to the myelinated time constant is:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau^{\\text{un}}}{\\tau^{\\text{my}}} = \\frac{R_{m}^{\\text{un}}C_{m}^{\\text{un}}}{R_{m}^{\\text{my}}C_{m}^{\\text{my}}} $$\n\nNow, we combine these two ratios to find the fold-change in velocity:\n$$ \\frac{v^{\\text{my}}}{v^{\\text{un}}} = \\left(\\frac{\\lambda^{\\text{my}}}{\\lambda^{\\text{un}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\tau^{\\text{un}}}{\\tau^{\\text{my}}}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m}^{\\text{my}}}{R_{m}^{\\text{un}}}} \\cdot \\frac{R_{m}^{\\text{un}}C_{m}^{\\text{un}}}{R_{m}^{\\text{my}}C_{m}^{\\text{my}}} $$\nThis expression can be simplified. Let $$x = R_{m}^{\\text{my}}$$ and $$y = R_{m}^{\\text{un}}$$. The resistance-dependent part of the expression is $$\\sqrt{x/y} \\cdot (y/x) = x^{1/2}y^{-1/2} \\cdot y^{1}x^{-1} = y^{1/2}x^{-1/2} = \\sqrt{y/x}$$. Thus, the final symbolic expression for the velocity ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{v^{\\text{my}}}{v^{\\text{un}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m}^{\\text{un}}}{R_{m}^{\\text{my}}}} \\cdot \\frac{C_{m}^{\\text{un}}}{C_{m}^{\\text{my}}} $$\n\nThe neuron doctrine, which posits that neurons are discrete, individual cells, is the foundational concept that allows for the structural and functional specialization of axons necessary for saltatory conduction. An axon is a continuous process of a single neuron, but it is not uniform. In myelinated axons, this discrete cellular unit is modified, with glial cells wrapping internodal sections while leaving small gaps, the nodes of Ranvier. This specialization is directly captured by the parameters $$R_{m}$$ and $$C_{m}$$. The myelin sheath functions as an electrical insulator, drastically increasing the effective membrane resistance ($$R_{m}^{\\text{my}} \\gg R_{m}^{\\text{un}}$$) because it restricts ion flow across the internodal membrane. Concurrently, by increasing the effective thickness of the membrane capacitor, myelin decreases the effective specific membrane capacitance ($$C_{m}^{\\text{my}} \\ll C_{m}^{\\text{un}}$$). At the nodes of Ranvier—the unmyelinated gaps between discrete glial wrappings—the axonal membrane has a high density of voltage-gated ion channels, allowing for the regeneration of the action potential. Saltatory conduction is the process whereby the action potential propagates rapidly and passively across the high-$$R_m$$, low-$$C_m$$ internode to the next node, where it is actively regenerated. This \"jumping\" is a direct consequence of the non-uniform, segmented structure of the axon, a specialization built upon the fundamental discreteness of the neuron as a cell.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of the fold-change using the provided data:\n$$ R_{m}^{\\text{un}} = 1.0 \\,\\Omega \\cdot \\text{m}^{2} $$\n$$ R_{m}^{\\text{my}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{2} \\,\\Omega \\cdot \\text{m}^{2} $$\n$$ C_{m}^{\\text{un}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\,\\text{F} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-2} $$\n$$ C_{m}^{\\text{my}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\text{F} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-2} $$\n\nSubstitute these values into the derived expression:\n$$ \\frac{v^{\\text{my}}}{v^{\\text{un}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.0}{5.0 \\times 10^{2}}} \\cdot \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-2}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}} $$\n$$ \\frac{v^{\\text{my}}}{v^{\\text{un}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{500}} \\cdot \\frac{10^{-2}}{10^{-4}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{500}} \\cdot 10^{2} $$\n$$ \\frac{v^{\\text{my}}}{v^{\\text{un}}} = \\frac{1}{10\\sqrt{5}} \\cdot 100 = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{5}} $$\nTo rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $$\\sqrt{5}$$:\n$$ \\frac{v^{\\text{my}}}{v^{\\text{un}}} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\\sqrt{5} $$\nThe numerical value is:\n$$ \\frac{v^{\\text{my}}}{v^{\\text{un}}} \\approx 2 \\times 2.2360679... = 4.4721359... $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the final result is $4.47$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.47}$$", "id": "5024793"}]}
