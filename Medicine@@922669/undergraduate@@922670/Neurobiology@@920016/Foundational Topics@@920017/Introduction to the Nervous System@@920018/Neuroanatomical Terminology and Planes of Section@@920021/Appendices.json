Consider a Cartesian coordinate system whose axes are aligned to the human neuroanatomical directions: the $x$-axis increases to the right (left-to-right), the $y$-axis increases anteriorly (posterior-to-anterior), and the $z$-axis increases superiorly (inferior-to-superior). This is the Right-Anterior-Superior (RAS) convention. By definition, a sagittal plane divides left and right and is orthogonal to the left-right axis, a coronal (frontal) plane divides anterior and posterior and is orthogonal to the anterior-posterior axis, and an axial (transverse) plane divides superior and inferior and is orthogonal to the inferior-superior axis.

The RAS coordinate system is a widely used convention in medical imaging (e.g., in the NIfTI data format). The definitions of sagittal, coronal, and axial planes as mutually orthogonal planes are correct. The representation of planes using normal vectors and the equation $a x + b y + c z + d = 0$ is a fundamental concept in analytical geometry. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is unambiguous and self-contained. It provides all necessary definitions to establish the coordinate system and the geometric properties of the planes. The task—to derive the plane equations and compute a determinant—is specific and leads to a unique, stable solution.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of any subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. The solution process may proceed.\n\n**Derivation of Plane Equations and Determinant Calculation**\n\nThe task is to derive the equations for the three principal neuroanatomical planes and then compute the determinant of a matrix formed by their normal vectors. Let the general form of a plane be $ax + by + cz + d = 0$, where $\\vec{n} = (a,b,c)$ is the normal vector to the plane.\n\n1.  **Mid-Sagittal Plane:**\n    By definition, a sagittal plane is orthogonal to the left-right axis. In the given RAS coordinate system, the left-right axis is the $x$-axis. A plane orthogonal to the $x$-axis must have a normal vector that is parallel to the $x$-axis. The direction vector for the $x$-axis is $(1,0,0)$. We can therefore choose the normal vector for the sagittal plane to be $\\vec{n}_{sag} = (a,b,c) = (1,0,0)$. Any non-zero scalar multiple, such as $(k,0,0)$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{R}, k \\neq 0$, would also be parallel, but $(1,0,0)$ is the simplest and canonical choice.\n\n    The equation of the plane is thus $1 \\cdot x + 0 \\cdot y + 0 \\cdot z + d = 0$, which simplifies to $x + d = 0$.\n    The problem specifies the *mid-sagittal* plane, which, by definition, passes through the origin $(0,0,0)$. Substituting the coordinates of the origin into the plane equation yields:\n    $0 + d = 0 \\implies d = 0$.\n    Therefore, the equation of the mid-sagittal plane is $x = 0$. The corresponding tuple of coefficients is $(a,b,c,d) = (1,0,0,0)$.\n\n2.  **Mid-Coronal Plane:**\n    A coronal plane is defined as being orthogonal to the posterior-to-anterior axis. This corresponds to the $y$-axis in our coordinate system. A plane orthogonal to the $y$-axis has a normal vector parallel to the $y$-axis. We choose the normal vector to be the unit vector in the $y$-direction, $\\vec{n}_{cor} = (a,b,c) = (0,1,0)$.\n\n    The equation of the plane becomes $0 \\cdot x + 1 \\cdot y + 0 \\cdot z + d = 0$, which simplifies to $y + d = 0$.\n    The *mid-coronal* plane must also pass through the origin $(0,0,0)$. Substituting these coordinates:\n    $0 + d = 0 \\implies d = 0$.\n    Thus, the equation of the mid-coronal plane is $y = 0$. The corresponding tuple of coefficients is $(a,b,c,d) = (0,1,0,0)$.\n\n3.  **Mid-Axial Plane:**\n    An axial plane is defined as being orthogonal to the inferior-to-superior axis, which is the $z$-axis. The normal vector to such a plane must be parallel to the $z$-axis. We choose the normal vector to be the unit vector in the $z$-direction, $\\vec{n}_{ax} = (a,b,c) = (0,0,1)$.\n\n    The equation of the plane is $0 \\cdot x + 0 \\cdot y + 1 \\cdot z + d = 0$, or $z + d = 0$.\n    The *mid-axial* plane contains the origin $(0,0,0)$. Substituting:\n    $0 + d = 0 \\implies d = 0$.\n    The equation of the mid-axial plane is $z = 0$. The corresponding tuple of coefficients is $(a,b,c,d) = (0,0,1,0)$.\n\n4.  **Matrix Formation and Determinant Calculation:**\n    The problem requires the construction of a $3 \\times 3$ matrix, let's call it $M$, whose rows are the normal vectors of the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes, in that order.\n    - Row $1$: $\\vec{n}_{sag} = (1,0,0)$\n    - Row $2$: $\\vec{n}_{cor} = (0,1,0)$\n    - Row $3$: $\\vec{n}_{ax} = (0,0,1)$\n\n    The resulting matrix is:\n    $$M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    This is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix, $I_{3}$. The determinant of an identity matrix of any dimension is $1$. We can also compute it directly using the cofactor expansion along the first row:\n    $$\\det(M) = 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{vmatrix} - 0 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{vmatrix} + 0 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{vmatrix}$$\n    $$\\det(M) = 1 \\cdot (1 \\cdot 1 - 0 \\cdot 0) - 0 + 0 = 1$$\n    The determinant is exactly $1$. The fact that the normal vectors form an orthonormal basis (and thus the matrix of these vectors is the identity matrix) is a direct, logical consequence of establishing a Cartesian coordinate system aligned with mutually orthogonal anatomical planes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "5040436"}, {"introduction": "In an ideal world, all brain images would be perfectly aligned with the standard anatomical axes, but in reality, slices are often acquired at an angle, creating \"oblique\" views.

This would occur if its normal vector were parallel to $\\mathbf{n}_{\\text{cor}} = (0, 1, 0)$.\n\nAn angle of $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians would signify that the slice plane is orthogonal to the coronal plane. Examples of such planes include the sagittal plane (normal vector typically aligned with the $x$-axis) and the axial (or horizontal) plane (normal vector aligned with the $z$-axis).\n\nThe calculated angle, $\\theta = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)$, is an intermediate value between $0$ and $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which indicates the slice is \"oblique\". The magnitude of this angle is a single, aggregate measure of how tilted the slice is relative to the standard coronal view.\n\nThe nature of this tilt can be understood by examining the components of the normal vector $\\mathbf{n} = (1, 2, 2)$. The canonical coronal plane's normal, $\\mathbf{n}_{\\text{cor}} = (0, 1, 0)$, has a component only along the $y$-axis (posterior-anterior). The oblique slice's normal vector has additional components along the $x$-axis (left-right) and the $z$-axis (inferior-superior).\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The non-zero $x$-component ($1$) indicates a tilt relative to the sagittal plane. Specifically, the plane defined by $x + 2y + 2z = d$ (where $d$ is a constant) is tilted such that for a fixed $z$, as $x$ increases (moving right), $y$ must decrease (moving posterior). This means the slice is oriented running from anterior-left to posterior-right.\n    \\item The non-zero $z$-component ($2$) indicates a tilt relative to the axial plane. For a fixed $x$, as $z$ increases (moving superiorly), $y$ must decrease (moving posterior). This means the slice is also oriented running from inferior-anterior to superior-posterior.\n\\end{itemize}\nThus, the angle $\\theta = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)$ represents the total angular magnitude of a compound tilt: the slice plane is tilted posteriorly on its right side and also tilted posteriorly on its superior side, relative to a true coronal plane.
