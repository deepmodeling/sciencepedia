The monosynaptic stretch reflex, like the familiar knee-jerk reaction, is the simplest and fastest of these neural circuits. This exercise moves beyond qualitative descriptions to quantify the speed of this circuit, challenging you to calculate the total time it takes for a signal to travel from a stretched muscle to the spinal cord and back [@problem_id:5076499]. By applying basic kinematic principles to physiological data, you will gain a tangible appreciation for the remarkable speed of neural communication.", "problem": "A monosynaptic stretch reflex elicited by a tendon tap in the quadriceps involves a somatic reflex arc mediated by primary muscle spindle afferents (group Ia) and alpha motor neurons. For a healthy adult, consider the following experimentally constrained parameters: the Ia afferent conduction velocity is $v_{\\mathrm{Ia}} = 120\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, the alpha motor efferent conduction velocity is $v_{\\alpha} = 60\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, the central synaptic delay per chemical synapse is $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{syn}} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, the path length from the muscle spindle to the relevant spinal segment is $L_{\\mathrm{aff}} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{m}$, and the path length from the spinal segment back to the quadriceps is $L_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{m}$.

It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe reflex loop latency, denoted as $t_{\\mathrm{total}}$, represents the total time elapsed along the somatic reflex arc described. This total time is the sum of the latencies of its constituent segments: the afferent conduction time ($t_{\\mathrm{aff}}$), the central synaptic delay ($\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{syn}}$), and the efferent conduction time ($t_{\\mathrm{eff}}$). The problem states we can ignore the neuromuscular junction delay and subsequent electromechanical delay.\n\nThe total latency can be expressed as:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{total}} = t_{\\mathrm{aff}} + \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{syn}} + t_{\\mathrm{eff}}\n$$\n\nThe conduction times for the afferent and efferent pathways can be calculated using the fundamental kinematic relation for motion at a constant velocity, $v$, over a distance, $L$:\n$$\nt = \\frac{L}{v}\n$$\n\nApplying this relation to the afferent and efferent pathways:\n1.

A key principle of the ANS is its use of distinct neurotransmitters and receptors to produce specific effects, a feature heavily exploited in modern medicine. This practice problem presents a common clinical scenario involving an asthma attack, asking you to predict the outcome of a drug that selectively targets a specific receptor in the sympathetic nervous system [@problem_id:1753473]. Solving this will solidify your understanding of how adrenergic receptors mediate the 'fight-or-flight' response in specific tissues.", "problem": "A patient with a history of asthma is brought to the emergency department experiencing an acute episode of shortness of breath and wheezing. This condition is primarily caused by the hyper-reactivity of the smooth muscle encircling the bronchioles, the smaller air passages in the lungs, leading to their significant narrowing. To alleviate the symptoms, the patient is administered an inhaled medication that is a selective agonist for beta-2 adrenergic receptors. These receptors are a type of G-protein coupled receptor found in high density on the surface of the airway smooth muscle cells. Based on the fundamental principles of autonomic nervous system physiology, what is the expected primary and immediate effect of this medication?\n\nA. An increase in airway diameter due to relaxation of the smooth muscle.\n\nB. A decrease in airway diameter due to contraction of the smooth muscle.\n\nC. A significant increase in the secretion of thick mucus into the airways.\n\nD. No change in airway diameter, as these receptors primarily regulate heart rate.\n\nE. A lasting paralysis of the airway smooth muscle, preventing future changes in diameter.", "solution": "The medication is a selective agonist of $\\beta_2$ adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle. These receptors are G-protein coupled receptors predominantly coupled to $G_\\text{s}$. Upon agonist binding:\n1. The $\\beta_2$ receptor activates $G_\\text{s}$, causing exchange of GDP for GTP on the $G_{\\text{s}\\alpha}$ subunit.\n2. Activated $G_{\\text{s}\\alpha}$ stimulates adenylyl cyclase, increasing the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP, thereby increasing intracellular $[\\text{cAMP}]$.\n3. Increased $\\text{cAMP}$ activates protein kinase A (PKA).\n4. PKA phosphorylates and inhibits myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), reducing phosphorylation of myosin light chains.\n5. Reduced MLCK activity decreases actin-myosin cross-bridge cycling in smooth muscle, producing relaxation of airway smooth muscle.\n\nThe immediate mechanical consequence of smooth muscle relaxation is an increase in bronchiolar radius $r$. By Poiseuille’s law for laminar flow,\n$$\nR = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^{4}},\n$$\nso an increase in $r$ causes a decrease in airway resistance $R$ and thus bronchodilation.

A competitive antagonist at these ganglionic nicotinic receptors blocks synaptic transmission through both divisions. Since the drug has no effect at muscarinic receptors or neuromuscular junction and does not cross the blood-brain barrier, the net physiological effects reflect loss of autonomic outflow at the ganglionic level. The observed change for any organ depends on which division exerts the predominant resting tone under the stated conditions (quiet, resting, thermoneutral).\n\nApply to each proposed effect:\n- I. Heart rate (SA node): Predominant resting tone is parasympathetic (vagal). Blocking ganglia removes parasympathetic influence more than sympathetic, leading to increased heart rate (tachycardia). Therefore I is true.\n- II. Arterioles and blood pressure: Arterioles receive predominantly sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone at rest; parasympathetic tone is minimal. Blocking ganglia abolishes sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone, causing widespread arteriolar vasodilation and a fall in blood pressure (hypotension). Therefore II is true.\n- III. Pupil diameter: Predominant resting tone in the iris sphincter is parasympathetic, maintaining miosis. Ganglionic blockade removes this parasympathetic tone, leading to mydriasis. Therefore III is true.\n- IV. Sweating (palms): Sweat glands are innervated by sympathetic cholinergic fibers; although effectors are muscarinic, the preganglionic-to-postganglionic synapse is nicotinic. Blocking ganglia prevents sympathetic outflow to sweat glands, decreasing sweating (anhidrosis), not increasing it. Therefore IV is false.\n- V. Gastrointestinal tract: Predominant resting tone is parasympathetic, promoting motility and secretion. Ganglionic blockade reduces parasympathetic outflow, decreasing GI motility and secretion. Therefore V is false.\n\nThe correct combination is I, II, and III only, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1753463"}]}
