Consider a simplified, biophysically plausible model in which the earliest efferent signal that will produce an action potential in a spinal motoneuron follows a single effective route with the following properties: the signal propagates along myelinated axons for a total path length $L$ (the sum of the afferent and descending segments) with uniform axonal conduction velocity $v$, and it crosses $n$ chemical synapses en route from the first afferent spike to the motoneuron’s axon hillock.

Ignore neuromuscular junction transmission and muscle electromechanical coupling by defining the response time as the latency to the motoneuron action potential initiation.\n\nStarting only from the definitions that time equals distance divided by speed for axonal conduction and that sequential delays sum, derive the expected response latency $T$ from perturbation onset to motoneuron action potential as a function of $L$, $v$, $n$, and $\\delta$. Express your final result in seconds as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $L$, $v$, $n$, and $\\delta$.", "solution": "The problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem that asks for the derivation of a response latency in a simplified neurobiological model. The premises are physically and biologically plausible for a first-order approximation, and all necessary information is provided.\n\nThe total response latency, which we denote as $T$, is the time elapsed from the initial perturbation to the initiation of the motoneuron action potential. The problem states that this total latency can be modeled as the linear sum of sequential, non-overlapping delays. The two sources of delay specified in the model are axonal conduction and synaptic transmission.\n\nLet $T_{\\text{cond}}$ be the total delay due to axonal conduction and $T_{\\text{syn}}$ be the total delay due to synaptic transmission. The total latency $T$ is therefore given by the sum:\n$$T = T_{\\text{cond}} + T_{\\text{syn}}$$\n\nWe will now derive an expression for each component based on the givens.\n\nFirst, we consider the axonal conduction delay, $T_{\\text{cond}}$. The problem specifies that the neural signal propagates along a total path length of $L$ with a uniform conduction velocity $v$. The problem requires us to use the definition that time equals distance divided by speed. Applying this principle, the time required for the signal to travel the entire axonal length is:\n$$T_{\\text{cond}} = \\frac{L}{v}$$\n\nNext, we consider the synaptic transmission delay, $T_{\\text{syn}}$. The signal path involves crossing $n$ chemical synapses. Each synapse is assumed to introduce a fixed transmission delay of $\\delta$. Since these synaptic crossings occur sequentially, their individual delays sum to give the total synaptic delay. Therefore, the total delay contributed by all synapses is the number of synapses, $n$, multiplied by the delay per synapse, $\\delta$:\n$$T_{\\text{syn}} = n\\delta$$\n\nFinally, to find the total response latency $T$, we substitute the expressions for $T_{\\text{cond}}$ and $T_{\\text{syn}}$ into our initial summation equation. This yields the complete expression for the latency as a function of the given parameters $L$, $v$, $n$, and $\\delta$:\n$$T = \\frac{L}{v} + n\\delta$$\n\nThis expression represents the total time from the start of the reflex arc to the firing of the final motoneuron, under the simplifying assumptions of the model. The units are consistent: if $L$ is in meters ($m$), $v$ in meters per second ($m/s$), and $\\delta$ in seconds ($s$), then the term $\\frac{L}{v}$ has units of seconds, and the term $n\\delta$ also has units of seconds, resulting in a total latency $T$ in seconds, as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{L}{v} + n\\delta}$$", "id": "5002566"}, {"introduction": "A classic method in neuroscience is to infer a system's function by observing the deficits that appear when it is damaged.

The analysis must be grounded in the following well-tested facts and core definitions: (i) the lateral vestibulospinal tract originates primarily from the lateral vestibular nucleus and descends ipsilaterally to facilitate antigravity extensor motor neuron pools; (ii) bilateral vestibular nuclei operate in a push–pull arrangement in which tonic activity on the left and right normally balances to maintain symmetric extensor tone; (iii) stable quiet stance requires that the net external torque about the roll axis (mediolateral axis through the feet) be $0$, i.e., $\\sum \\tau_{\\text{ext}} = 0$, and deviations create lateral acceleration of the center of mass according to $\\alpha_{\\text{roll}} = \\sum \\tau_{\\text{ext}}/I_{\\text{roll}}$, where $I_{\\text{roll}}$ is the effective moment of inertia about the roll axis; (iv) center-of-mass motion in the frontal plane is corrected by ankle-hip strategies that rely on extensor torque generation.\n\nAssume that the lesion interrupts ipsilateral LVST fibers below $C5$ without directly impairing the medial vestibulospinal tract or corticospinal control.

In the intact state, $M_L = M_R$, yielding $\\sum \\tau_{\\text{ext}} = 0$. After the unilateral LVST lesion on the left at $C5$, the ipsilesional extensor drive below the lesion is reduced, such that $M_L' = \\kappa M_L$ with $0 < \\kappa < 1$, while $M_R$ remains approximately unchanged. The student must predict the qualitative direction of postural asymmetry and the sway pattern in the frontal plane, and explain how it reflects push–pull imbalance across vestibular nuclei and its motor output pathways.\n\nWhich option best predicts the postural asymmetry and sway pattern, and correctly relates it to the underlying push–pull imbalance?\n\nA. Ipsilesional tilt of head, trunk, and body with a low-frequency drift of the center of mass toward the lesion and increased frontal-plane sway amplitude; this arises because loss of ipsilateral LVST extensor facilitation creates a net contralesional push–pull dominance, leaving contralesional extensor output relatively stronger and producing a persistent lateral torque bias.\n\nB.

Deviations lead to lateral acceleration of the center of mass (COM) as per $\\alpha_{\\text{roll}} = \\sum \\tau_{\\text{ext}}/I_{\\text{roll}}$, where $I_{\\text{roll}}$ is the moment of inertia about the roll axis.\n- **Fact (iv):** COM motion in the frontal plane is corrected by ankle-hip strategies that utilize extensor torque generation.\n- **Assumptions:** The lesion affects ipsilateral LVST fibers below $C5$.

The contralesional (right) moment $M_R$ is approximately unchanged.\n- **Objective:** To predict the direction of postural asymmetry and the sway pattern in the frontal plane and explain it in the context of the push–pull mechanism.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound and well-posed.\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The facts provided are standard, foundational principles of motor neurophysiology and biomechanics. Fact (i) correctly describes the origin, course, and function of the LVST. Fact (ii) correctly describes the push-pull organization of the vestibular system. Fact (iii) correctly applies Newton's second law for rotation to postural stability. Fact (iv) accurately describes postural correction strategies. The scenario of a unilateral lesion is a classic method for studying motor pathway function.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is clearly defined with an initial state, a specific perturbation, and a quantitative model of the perturbation's effect ($M_L' = \\kappa M_L$). The assumptions serve to isolate the primary effects of the LVST lesion, making the problem solvable. The question is specific and asks for a qualitative prediction based on the provided framework.\n- **Objectivity:** The language is formal and precise, using established terminology. It is free of ambiguity and subjective claims.\n- **Conclusion:** The problem is valid. It presents a logical, self-contained scenario that can be analyzed using the provided principles.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Solution\nBased on the valid problem statement, we can deduce the consequences of the lesion.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial State (Intact):** In quiet stance, the body is an inverted pendulum. To maintain upright posture, antigravity muscles, particularly the extensors of the legs and trunk, must be active. In the frontal plane (mediolateral balance), the extensor musculature on the left and right sides of the body generates moments, $M_L$ and $M_R$. The problem states that in the intact state, $M_L = M_R$. This symmetry of muscular support ensures that the net torque on the body about the roll axis is zero ($\\sum \\tau_{\\text{ext}} = 0$), and the center of mass remains stable between the feet. This balanced motor output reflects the balanced tonic activity of the left and right vestibular nuclei, as per Fact (ii).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Perturbation (Lesion):** A lesion interrupts the left LVST at $C5$. According to Fact (i), the LVST is an ipsilateral pathway that facilitates extensor motor neurons. Therefore, this lesion will reduce the facilitatory drive to the left-side extensor muscles of the trunk and lower limbs (those innervated below $C5$). The problem quantifies this as a reduction in the left-side extensor moment from $M_L$ to $M_L' = \\kappa M_L$, with $0 < \\kappa < 1$. The right-side moment, $M_R$, driven by the intact right LVST, remains unchanged.\n\n3.  **Determine the Immediate Effect (Torque Imbalance):** After the lesion, the extensor moments are no longer balanced. We now have $M_L' < M_L$. Since the intact state had $M_L = M_R$, it follows that $M_L' < M_R$. The extensor support on the right (contralesional) side is now stronger than the extensor support on the left (ipsilesional) side. This asymmetry creates a net external torque. The relatively stronger right-side extensors will \"push\" the body more effectively against gravity than the weakened left-side extensors. This imbalance results in a net torque that causes the body to roll *towards* the weaker, left (ipsilesional) side. This constitutes a persistent lateral torque bias.\n\n4.  **Predict the Postural Response (Asymmetry and Sway):**\n    -   **Drift and Tilt:** According to Fact (iii), a non-zero net torque ($\\sum \\tau_{\\text{ext}} \\neq 0$) will cause an angular acceleration ($\\alpha_{\\text{roll}}$). The net torque rolling the body to the left will cause the center of mass to accelerate and drift towards the left (the side of the lesion). To maintain any semblance of balance, the subject must adopt a static posture that is tilted towards the ipsilesional (left) side.\n    -   **Sway:** The postural control system will attempt to correct this drift. According to Fact (iv), this is done via ankle-hip strategies. To counteract the leftward drift, the system must generate a corrective torque to the right. However, the ability to generate a rightward torque by increasing left-side extensor activity is compromised by the lesion. The nervous system must therefore rely on a combination of reducing right-side activity and whatever limited control remains on the left. This continuous process of drifting towards the lesion due to the underlying motor bias, followed by an attempted, often inefficient, correction, will result in an increase in the amplitude of postural sway in the frontal plane. This sway is characterized by a low-frequency drift towards the lesion side.\n\n5.  **Relate to a Push-Pull Mechanism:** The phenomenon is a direct consequence of the disruption of the push-pull balance at the level of the motor output. In the intact state, the \"push\" from the left LVST on left extensors is balanced by the \"push\" from the right LVST on right extensors. The lesion weakens the left-side \"push\". This leaves the right-side \"push\" relatively unopposed, creating what the problem terms a \"net contralesional push–pull dominance\". This dominance of the contralesional motor output is what drives the body towards the ipsilesional side.\n\n### Step 4: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Ipsilesional tilt of head, trunk, and body with a low-frequency drift of the center of mass toward the lesion and increased frontal-plane sway amplitude; this arises because loss of ipsilateral LVST extensor facilitation creates a net contralesional push–pull dominance, leaving contralesional extensor output relatively stronger and producing a persistent lateral torque bias.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with our derivation. It correctly identifies the direction of tilt and drift (ipsilesional), the nature of the sway (increased amplitude, low-frequency), and the underlying mechanism (loss of ipsilateral facilitation leading to relative dominance of contralesional extensor output and a resulting torque bias).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Contralesional tilt and drift away from the lesion due to loss of contralateral inhibition, resulting in unopposed ipsilesional extensor drive; the push–pull arrangement causes ipsilesional vestibular nuclei to become hyperactive when their output tract is lesioned.**\nThis option contains multiple errors. The tilt is ipsilesional, not contralesional. The lesion causes *reduced* ipsilesional extensor drive, not \"unopposed\" drive. The LVST is primarily ipsilaterally excitatory, not a source of contralateral inhibition. Finally, a lesion of an axon tract does not cause hyperactivity of the source nucleus.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. No persistent lateral bias in stance; only increased anteroposterior sway because the lateral vestibulospinal tract primarily facilitates bilateral flexor tone, while frontal-plane posture is mediated by the medial vestibulospinal tract.**\nThis option is factually incorrect. A unilateral lesion inherently creates a lateral bias. The statement that the LVST facilitates flexor tone is the opposite of its known function and contradicts Fact (i). While the MVST is important, the LVST is crucial for frontal plane stability via its control of limb and trunk extensors.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Ipsilesional tilt, but the sway change is dominated by high-frequency tremor-like oscillations limited to the neck, due to the lesion primarily affecting medial vestibulospinal tract control of cervical muscles, leaving lower limb extensor tone balanced.**\nThis option incorrectly describes the sway (it should be low-frequency postural sway, not high-frequency tremor), its location (it affects the whole body, not just the neck, as lower limb extensors are key), and the cause. It incorrectly implicates the MVST, whereas the problem explicitly states the lesion is in the LVST. It also falsely claims lower limb extensor tone is balanced, which is the very thing the lesion disrupts.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5002553"}, {"introduction": "Building on the previous exercises, this final practice problem simulates a complete, realistic postural reflex from start to finish.
