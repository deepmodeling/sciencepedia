This pathway consists of two principal components: the conduction time along the corticospinal tract (CST) and the synaptic delay at the cortico-motoneuronal synapse.\nThe conduction time is given by the ratio of distance to velocity.

In the context of motor control, the fastest pathways mediate the earliest components of a response. Therefore, the direct monosynaptic connection enables the most rapid possible influence of the motor cortex on spinal motoneurons. The additional delay of the disynaptic pathway, while providing an opportunity for spinal-level processing and modulation via the interneuron, means that it cannot contribute to the initial onset of a rapid corrective motor command.
