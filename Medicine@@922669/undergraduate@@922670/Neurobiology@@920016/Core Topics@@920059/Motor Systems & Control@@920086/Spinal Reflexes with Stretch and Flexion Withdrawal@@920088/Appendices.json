The solution proceeds.\n\nThe total reflex latency, $T_{total}$, is defined as the time from the initial stimulus (tendon tap) to the onset of the measurable response (muscle force). Based on the principle that serial latencies add linearly, this total time is the sum of the latencies of each sequential event in the reflex arc. The sequence of events is as follows:\n$1$. The sensory signal propagates along the type Ia afferent fiber from the muscle spindle in the quadriceps to the spinal cord. This is the afferent conduction time, $t_{Ia}$.\n$2$. The signal is transmitted across the synapse from the Ia afferent to the alpha motor neuron in the spinal cord. This is the central synaptic delay, $\\delta_{syn}$.\n$3$. The motor command propagates along the alpha motor neuron axon from the spinal cord back to the neuromuscular junction of the quadriceps muscle. This is the efferent conduction time, $t_{\\alpha}$.\n$4$. A series of processes, including neurotransmitter release, muscle fiber depolarization, and excitation-contraction coupling, occur before measurable force is generated.

A rigorous solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe objective is to find the minimal nociceptor firing rate, denoted $r_{N}^{\\ast}$, that simultaneously satisfies the conditions for flexor motoneuron activation and extensor motoneuron suppression at time $t=T$.\n\nFirst, we express the firing rates of the flexor motoneuron pool, $r_{F}(t)$, and the extensor motoneuron pool, $r_{X}(t)$, as direct functions of the constant nociceptor input rate, $r_{N}$.\n\nFor the flexor pathway:\nThe firing rate of the flexor motoneuron pool is given by $r_{F}(t) = w_{EF}\\,r_{E}(t - d_{EF})$. Substituting the expression for the excitatory interneuron rate, $r_{E}(t) = k_{E}\\,r_{N}(t - d_{NE})$, we obtain:\n$$r_{F}(t) = w_{EF} \\left( k_{E}\\,r_{N}(t - d_{NE} - d_{EF}) \\right) = w_{EF}k_{E}\\,r_{N}(t - (d_{NE} + d_{EF}))$$\nThe total delay in the flexor pathway, $d_{F,\\text{tot}}$, is the sum of the individual delays:\n$$d_{F,\\text{tot}} = d_{NE} + d_{EF} = 2\\,\\mathrm{ms} + 1\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 3\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\nSince the nociceptor rate $r_{N}(t)$ is constant for $t \\in [0, T]$, and we are evaluating the system at $t = T = 10\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, the argument of $r_{N}$ is $T - d_{F,\\text{tot}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{ms} - 3\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 7\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. As $7\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ is within the interval $[0, T]$, $r_{N}(7\\,\\mathrm{ms}) = r_{N}$. Thus, the flexor motoneuron firing rate at time $T$ is:\n$$r_{F}(T) = w_{EF}k_{E}r_{N}$$\n\nFor the extensor pathway:\nThe firing rate of the extensor motoneuron pool is $r_{X}(t) = \\max\\{0,\\,B_{0} - w_{IX}\\,r_{I}(t - d_{IX})\\}$. Substituting the expression for the inhibitory interneuron rate, $r_{I}(t) = k_{I}\\,r_{N}(t - d_{NI})$, we get:\n$$r_{X}(t) = \\max\\left\\{0, B_{0} - w_{IX} \\left( k_{I}\\,r_{N}(t - d_{NI} - d_{IX}) \\right)\\right\\} = \\max\\left\\{0, B_{0} - w_{IX}k_{I}\\,r_{N}(t - (d_{NI} + d_{IX}))\\right\\}$$\nThe total delay in the inhibitory pathway to the extensor, $d_{X,\\text{tot}}$, is:\n$$d_{X,\\text{tot}} = d_{NI} + d_{IX} = 2\\,\\mathrm{ms} + 1\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 3\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\nSimilarly, at $t = T = 10\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, the argument of $r_{N}$ is $T - d_{X,\\text{tot}} = 7\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. Therefore, the extensor motoneuron firing rate at time $T$ is:\n$$r_{X}(T) = \\max\\{0, B_{0} - w_{IX}k_{I}r_{N}\\}$$\n\nNow, we apply the two conditions given in the problem statement.\n1.  **Flexor Activation Condition**: $r_{F}(T) \\ge \\Theta_{F}$\n    $$w_{EF}k_{E}r_{N} \\ge \\Theta_{F}$$\n    Solving for $r_{N}$, we find the first lower bound:\n    $$r_{N} \\ge \\frac{\\Theta_{F}}{w_{EF}k_{E}}$$\n2.  **Extensor Suppression Condition**: $r_{X}(T) \\le \\Theta_{X}$\n    $$\\max\\{0, B_{0} - w_{IX}k_{I}r_{N}\\} \\le \\Theta_{X}$$\n    Since the threshold $\\Theta_{X} = 2\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ is positive, the condition $0 \\le \\Theta_{X}$ is always satisfied. The constraint thus applies to the non-zero branch of the $\\max$ function:\n    $$B_{0} - w_{IX}k_{I}r_{N} \\le \\Theta_{X}$$\n    Rearranging to solve for $r_{N}$:\n    $$B_{0} - \\Theta_{X} \\le w_{IX}k_{I}r_{N}$$\n    $$r_{N} \\ge \\frac{B_{0} - \\Theta_{X}}{w_{IX}k_{I}}$$\n\nTo satisfy both conditions simultaneously, $r_{N}$ must be greater than or equal to the maximum of the two derived lower bounds. The minimal rate, $r_{N}^{\\ast}$, is therefore:\n$$r_{N}^{\\ast} = \\max\\left(\\frac{\\Theta_{F}}{w_{EF}k_{E}}, \\frac{B_{0} - \\Theta_{X}}{w_{IX}k_{I}}\\right)$$\n\nWe now substitute the provided numerical values into this expression.\nThe lower bound from the flexor condition is:\n$$\\frac{\\Theta_{F}}{w_{EF}k_{E}} = \\frac{30}{(1.2)(0.8)} = \\frac{30}{0.96} = 31.25\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\nThe lower bound from the extensor condition is:\n$$\\frac{B_{0} - \\Theta_{X}}{w_{IX}k_{I}} = \\frac{20 - 2}{(1.5)(0.5)} = \\frac{18}{0.75} = 24\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\n\nThe minimal required rate $r_{N}^{\\ast}$ is the maximum of these two values:\n$$r_{N}^{\\ast} = \\max(31.25, 24) = 31.25\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\nThe condition on the flexor motoneuron pool is more stringent and thus determines the overall minimal nociceptor firing rate.
