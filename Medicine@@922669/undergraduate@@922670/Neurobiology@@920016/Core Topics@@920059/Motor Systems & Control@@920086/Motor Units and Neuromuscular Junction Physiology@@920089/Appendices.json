Express your final answer as a closed-form expression in terms of $p$, with no units, and do not perform any numerical rounding.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of synaptic physiology, specifically the quantal theory of neurotransmitter release. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two results: first, the derivation of the quantal content $m$ as a function of the number of active zones $n$ and the release probability $p$; second, the calculation of the increase in quantal content, $\\Delta m$, as $n$ increases from $n_1 = 300$ to $n_2 = 600$.\n\nLet us begin with the first part. The release of a synaptic vesicle from a single active zone upon the arrival of an action potential is modeled as a stochastic event. We are given that this event can be described as a Bernoulli trial. Let us define a random variable $X_i$ for each of the $n$ active zones, where $i = 1, 2, ..., n$. The variable $X_i$ represents the outcome of the release event at the $i$-th active zone.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, at most one vesicle is released per active zone per action potential. Therefore, $X_i$ can take one of two values:\n- $X_i = 1$ if a vesicle is released (with probability $p$).\n- $X_i = 0$ if no vesicle is released (with probability $1-p$).\n\nThis defines $X_i$ as a Bernoulli random variable with parameter $p$. The expected value of a single Bernoulli trial, $E[X_i]$, is calculated as:\n$$E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot P(X_i=1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_i=0) = 1 \\cdot p + 0 \\cdot (1-p) = p$$\n\nThe total number of vesicles released across all $n$ active zones is the sum of the outcomes from each individual active zone. Let us denote this total number by the random variable $K$.\n$$K = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$$\n\nThe quantal content, $m$, is defined as the expected number of synaptic vesicles released per action potential. Therefore, $m$ is the expected value of $K$.\n$$m = E[K] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right]$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the vesicle release events at different active zones are independent and directs us to use the linearity of expectation. The linearity of expectation states that the expected value of a sum of random variables is equal to the sum of their individual expected values, regardless of whether they are independent.\n$$m = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_i]$$\n\nSince each active zone is assumed to have the same identical release probability $p$, the expected value for each $X_i$ is the same: $E[X_i] = p$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, ..., n\\}$. Substituting this into the sum:\n$$m = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p$$\n\nThis is a sum of $n$ identical terms, which simplifies to:\n$$m = np$$\nThis completes the first part of the derivation. The quantal content $m$ is the product of the number of release sites $n$ and the probability of release $p$.\n\nNow, we proceed to the second part of the problem: calculating the expected increase in quantal content, $\\Delta m$.\nLet the initial state be defined by $n_1 = 300$ active zones. The corresponding quantal content is $m_1$.\n$$m_1 = n_1 p = 300p$$\n\nDuring maturation, the number of active zones increases to a final state defined by $n_2 = 600$. The problem states that the release probability $p$ remains constant. The final quantal content is $m_2$.\n$$m_2 = n_2 p = 600p$$\n\nThe expected increase in quantal content, $\\Delta m$, is the difference between the final and initial quantal contents.\n$$\\Delta m = m_2 - m_1$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $m_1$ and $m_2$:\n$$\\Delta m = 600p - 300p$$\nFactoring out the constant probability $p$:\n$$\\Delta m = (600 - 300)p$$\n$$\\Delta m = 300p$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the expected increase in quantal content in terms of $p$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{300p}$$", "id": "5034395"}, {"introduction": "While understanding a single neuromuscular junction is crucial, neurophysiologists are often interested in the health of the entire muscle and its nerve supply. This practice [@problem_id:5034404] introduces Motor Unit Number Estimation (MUNE), a powerful diagnostic technique used to assess the number of functional motor units in conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). You will see how simple assumptions about signal summation allow us to estimate this vital, hidden number by relating the maximal response of the whole muscle (the CMAP) to the average response of a single motor unit (the SMUP).", "problem": "A motor unit is defined as a single alpha motor neuron and all the skeletal muscle fibers it innervates. When the motor nerve is electrically stimulated, acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction depolarizes the muscle fiber end plates sufficiently to trigger muscle fiber action potentials. The extracellularly recorded compound muscle action potential (CMAP) reflects the near-synchronous superposition of all individual motor unit action potentials when stimulation is supramaximal. In incremental stimulation protocols, as the stimulus intensity is increased from subthreshold, additional motor axons are recruited in an all-or-none manner, and each recruitment step produces an increment in the recorded muscle potential that approximates a single motor unit potential (SMUP). Assume the following foundational principles: (1) linear superposition of individual motor unit potentials under quasi-synchronous activation, (2) independence of motor unit activation thresholds across axons, and (3) that the average SMUP amplitude obtained from many increments is an unbiased estimate of the mean contribution of a single motor unit to the CMAP amplitude under the same recording conditions.\n\nStarting from these principles and definitions, derive an expression for the motor unit number estimation (MUNE), defined as the estimated number of motor units in the muscle, in terms of the CMAP amplitude and the average SMUP amplitude obtained by incremental stimulation. Then, using a measured CMAP amplitude of $10~\\mathrm{mV}$ and an average SMUP amplitude of $50~\\mu\\mathrm{V}$, compute the MUNE. Round your final answer to three significant figures.

The principles provided are standard simplifying assumptions used in the neurophysiological technique of Motor Unit Number Estimation (MUNE). The provided values for the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and single motor unit potential (SMUP) are physiologically realistic. I will therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the Motor Unit Number Estimation (MUNE) and then calculate its value based on the provided data.\n\nLet $N$ be the true total number of motor units in the muscle.\nLet $A_{\\mathrm{CMAP}}$ denote the amplitude of the maximal CMAP. The maximal CMAP is recorded under supramaximal stimulation, which activates all motor axons innervating the muscle.\nLet $A_{i}$ be the amplitude of the potential generated by the $i$-th motor unit, for $i$ from $1$ to $N$.\n\nAccording to Principle ($1$), the principle of linear superposition, the total CMAP amplitude is the sum of the amplitudes of the individual motor unit action potentials. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{CMAP}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} A_{i}$$\n\nThe mean (or average) amplitude of a single motor unit potential, which we denote as $\\bar{A}_{\\mathrm{unit}}$, is the total amplitude divided by the number of units:\n$$\\bar{A}_{\\mathrm{unit}} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} A_{i}$$\n\nBy substituting the expression for the sum from the first equation into the second, we can relate the CMAP amplitude to the mean unit amplitude and the total number of units:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{CMAP}} = N \\cdot \\bar{A}_{\\mathrm{unit}}$$\n\nThe MUNE technique does not measure the true mean amplitude $\\bar{A}_{\\mathrm{unit}}$ directly. Instead, it measures the average SMUP amplitude from an incremental stimulation protocol. Let us denote this measured quantity as $\\overline{A_{\\mathrm{SMUP}}}$.\n\nAccording to Principle ($3$), $\\overline{A_{\\mathrm{SMUP}}}$ is an unbiased estimate of the mean contribution of a single motor unit, which is $\\bar{A}_{\\mathrm{unit}}$. Therefore, we can use $\\overline{A_{\\mathrm{SMUP}}}$ as an approximation for $\\bar{A}_{\\mathrm{unit}}$:\n$$\\bar{A}_{\\mathrm{unit}} \\approx \\overline{A_{\\mathrm{SMUP}}}$$\n\nSubstituting this approximation into our equation for $A_{\\mathrm{CMAP}}$ gives:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{CMAP}} \\approx N \\cdot \\overline{A_{\\mathrm{SMUP}}}$$\n\nThe Motor Unit Number Estimation (MUNE) is the estimate of $N$ based on these measured quantities. By rearranging the above relation to solve for $N$, we obtain the desired expression for MUNE:\n$$\\text{MUNE} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{CMAP}}}{\\overline{A_{\\mathrm{SMUP}}}}$$\n\nThis equation represents the derived relationship. Now, we will compute the numerical value for MUNE using the data provided in the problem statement.\n\nThe given values are:\nMaximum CMAP amplitude, $A_{\\mathrm{CMAP}} = 10~\\mathrm{mV}$\nAverage SMUP amplitude, $\\overline{A_{\\mathrm{SMUP}}} = 50~\\mu\\mathrm{V}$\n\nTo perform the calculation, both amplitudes must be in the same units.

The problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. To express the integer $200$ with a precision of three significant figures, it must be written in a format that makes the trailing zeros significant. The standard and unambiguous way to do this is using scientific notation.\n$200$ expressed with one significant figure is $2 \\times 10^2$.\n$200$ expressed with two significant figures is $2.0 \\times 10^2$.\n$200$ expressed with three significant figures is $2.00 \\times 10^2$.\n\nThus, the final answer, rounded to three significant figures, is $2.00 \\times 10^2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.00 \\times 10^2}$$", "id": "5034404"}, {"introduction": "Synaptic transmission is not a static process; the strength of a synapse changes dynamically depending on its recent history of activity.

The system state at the time of stimulus $i$ is described by $N_i$, the number of vesicles available in the RRP. Initially, the pool is full, so $N_1 = N_{\\max}$.\n2.  According to the quantal hypothesis, the expected number of vesicles released by stimulus $i$, denoted $A_i$, is proportional to the number of available vesicles $N_i$ and the release probability $p$:\n    $$\n    A_i = p N_i\n    $$\n3.  Immediately following vesicle release, the number of vesicles remaining in the RRP is diminished:\n    $$\n    N_i^{\\mathrm{post}} = N_i - A_i = N_i - p N_i = (1 - p) N_i\n    $$\n4.  Between stimuli, the RRP is replenished. The stimuli arrive at a frequency $f$, corresponding to an inter-stimulus interval of $\\Delta t = 1/f$. During this interval, $R \\Delta t$ vesicles are added to the pool, where $R$ is the constant replenishment rate. The pool size cannot exceed its maximum capacity, $N_{\\max}$.
