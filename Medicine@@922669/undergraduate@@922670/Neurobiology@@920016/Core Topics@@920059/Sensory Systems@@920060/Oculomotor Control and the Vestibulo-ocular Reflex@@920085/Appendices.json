Consider a subject with the following rightward motions defined in the world frame: head angular velocity $\\omega_{\\mathrm{head}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$ and target angular velocity $\\omega_{\\mathrm{target}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$. Adopt the sign convention that rightward angular velocities are positive. Use the following fundamental definitions:\n\n- The gaze (eye-in-world) angular velocity is the sum of the eye-in-head and head-in-world angular velocities: $\\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{eye}} + \\omega_{\\mathrm{head}}$.\n- The retinal slip is the target angular velocity relative to the gaze: $\\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{target}} - \\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze}}$.\n- Perfect fixation on the target requires $\\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}} = 0$.\n- The VOR generates an eye-in-head angular velocity opposing head motion that scales with the VOR gain $g$ as $\\omega_{\\mathrm{VOR}} = -g\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{head}}$.\n\nFirst, derive the eye-in-head angular velocity $\\omega_{\\mathrm{eye,req}}$ required for perfect fixation on this moving target during the given head rotation.

All angular velocities are given in $\\mathrm{deg/s}$, and the sign convention is that rightward motion is positive.\n\nThe given data and definitions are:\nHead-in-world angular velocity: $\\omega_{\\mathrm{head}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$.\nTarget-in-world angular velocity: $\\omega_{\\mathrm{target}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$.\nGaze angular velocity: $\\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{eye}} + \\omega_{\\mathrm{head}}$.\nRetinal slip angular velocity: $\\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{target}} - \\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze}}$.\nCondition for perfect fixation: $\\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}} = 0$.\nVOR eye velocity: $\\omega_{\\mathrm{VOR}} = -g\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{head}}$.\nVOR gain for the second part of the problem: $g = 0.9$.\n\nFirst, we determine the required eye-in-head angular velocity, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{eye,req}}$, for perfect fixation. Perfect fixation requires the retinal slip to be zero:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}} = 0 $$\nUsing the definition of retinal slip, we set it to zero to find the required gaze velocity, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze,req}}$:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{target}} - \\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze,req}} = 0 $$\nThis implies that the gaze angular velocity must be equal to the target angular velocity:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze,req}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{target}} $$\nGiven $\\omega_{\\mathrm{target}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$, the required gaze velocity is $\\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze,req}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$.\nNow, we use the relationship between gaze, eye, and head velocities to solve for the required eye-in-head velocity, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{eye,req}}$:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze,req}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{eye,req}} + \\omega_{\\mathrm{head}} $$\nRearranging for $\\omega_{\\mathrm{eye,req}}$:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{eye,req}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze,req}} - \\omega_{\\mathrm{head}} $$\nSubstituting the known values for $\\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze,req}}$ (which is equal to $\\omega_{\\mathrm{target}}$) and $\\omega_{\\mathrm{head}}$:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{eye,req}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s} - 20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s} = 0\\,\\mathrm{deg/s} $$\nThe first required quantity is $\\omega_{\\mathrm{eye,req}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$. This means that to perfectly track a target moving at the same angular velocity as the head, the eyes must remain stationary within the head (i.e., in their orbits). This scenario is known as VOR cancellation.\n\nSecond, we calculate the retinal slip, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}}$, under the assumption that the only active oculomotor contribution is the VOR with a gain $g = 0.9$. In this case, the actual eye-in-head velocity, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{eye}}$, is equal to the velocity generated by the VOR, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{VOR}}$:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{eye}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{VOR}} = -g\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{head}} $$\nUsing the given values $g = 0.9$ and $\\omega_{\\mathrm{head}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{eye}} = -(0.9) \\times (20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}) = -18\\,\\mathrm{deg/s} $$\nThe negative sign indicates a leftward eye rotation, correctly opposing the rightward head rotation. Now, we calculate the actual resulting gaze velocity, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze}}$, using this eye velocity:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{eye}} + \\omega_{\\mathrm{head}} = -18\\,\\mathrm{deg/s} + 20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s} = 2\\,\\mathrm{deg/s} $$\nThe gaze (eye in world) moves rightward at $2\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$. Finally, we can compute the retinal slip using its definition:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{target}} - \\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze}} $$\nSubstituting the values for $\\omega_{\\mathrm{target}}$ and the calculated $\\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze}}$:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s} - 2\\,\\mathrm{deg/s} = 18\\,\\mathrm{deg/s} $$\nThe second required quantity is $\\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}} = 18\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$. The positive value indicates that the target's image slips across the retina in the rightward direction, as the gaze velocity of $2\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$ is insufficient to keep up with the target's velocity of $20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the two answers in order: $\\omega_{\\mathrm{eye,req}}$ and $\\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}}$.\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{eye,req}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{deg/s} $$\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}} = 18\\,\\mathrm{deg/s} $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0  18 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "5048460"}, {"introduction": "A simple, fixed reflex would fail in our complex world, and the VOR is anything but simple.
