This practice challenges you to connect these distinct sensory experiences to their underlying physiological pathways, a fundamental skill in neurobiology.

Two distinct, localized stimuli are applied to a subject's skin on separate occasions.\n\nStimulus 1 consists of a brief, sharp prick from a sterile, fine-tipped mechanical probe. The subject reports an immediate, sharp, and easily localized pricking sensation. This is often referred to as \"first pain\".\n\nStimulus 2 involves the application of a small drop of a solution containing a mild chemical irritant. The subject reports a sensation that develops more slowly, feels dull and burning, and is poorly localized. This is characteristic of \"second pain\".\n\nBased on these observations, identify the primary class of nociceptors and the predominant type of afferent nerve fiber that transduce and transmit the initial sensory signal for each stimulus.\n\nA.

The physiological principle is that faster conduction arises from myelination and larger axon diameter. Thinly myelinated A-delta fibers conduct faster than unmyelinated C fibers, producing the early “first pain.” The transducing receptors for a brief, punctate mechanical probe are mechanical (often mechanothermal) nociceptors that are activated by high-threshold mechanical stimuli. Therefore, Stimulus 1 is mediated by mechanical nociceptors carried predominantly by A-delta fibers.\n\nFor Stimulus 2 (slowly developing, dull, burning, poorly localized “second pain”): The temporal delay and diffuse, burning quality indicate the slow-conducting, unmyelinated C fibers. The transducing receptors for a mild chemical irritant are typically polymodal nociceptors, which respond to chemical, thermal, and mechanical stimuli and predominantly project via C fibers, producing the delayed “second pain.” Although “silent” nociceptors can be recruited after inflammation, the canonical mediator of a mild chemical irritant–evoked dull burn is the polymodal C-fiber nociceptor.\n\nMatching these to the options:\n- Stimulus 1: mechanical nociceptors via A-delta fibers.\n- Stimulus 2: polymodal nociceptors via C fibers.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1753990"}, {"introduction": "Our perception of the world isn't always a straightforward reflection of reality; sometimes, the brain's interpretation of sensory signals leads to surprising illusions. The thermal grill illusion, where a non-painful pattern of warm and cool temperatures can feel intensely painful, is a classic example. This exercise provides a simplified quantitative model that uncovers a plausible mechanism for this phenomenon, demonstrating how the central nervous system integrates—and sometimes misinterprets—competing sensory inputs from different pathways [@problem_id:1753969].", "problem": "A neurophysiologist is developing a simplified quantitative model to explain the thermal grill illusion, where an interleaved pattern of non-painful warm and cool stimuli elicits a paradoxical sensation of burning cold. The model focuses on the convergence of two types of primary afferent fibers onto a single second-order neuron in the spinal cord, whose net activity corresponds to the perceived pain.\n\nThe model is defined as follows:\n\n1.  A polymodal C-fiber, which can signal noxious cold, has a firing rate $f_C$ given by the function:\n    $f_C(T) = k_C \\cdot \\max(0, T_{ref} - T)$, where $T$ is the temperature of its receptive field, $T_{ref} = 33.0^\\circ\\text{C}$ is the neutral skin temperature, and $k_C = 2.50 \\text{ impulses}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}\\cdot^\\circ\\text{C}^{-1}$ is a response constant.\n\n2.  A non-nociceptive A-delta fiber, which signals innocuous cool temperatures, has a firing rate $f_{A\\delta}$ given by the function:\n    $f_{A\\delta}(T) = k_{A\\delta} \\cdot \\max(0, T_{ref} - T)$, with a response constant $k_{A\\delta} = 8.00 \\text{ impulses}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}\\cdot^\\circ\\text{C}^{-1}$.\n\n3.  The C-fiber provides an excitatory input, and the A-delta fiber provides an inhibitory input to the second-order neuron.

Individually, a uniform stimulus at $T_{cool}$ is perceived as cool but not painful. In the model, this implies that the baseline inhibitory weight, $W_{A\\delta,0}$, is precisely tuned such that $A_{pain} = 0$ when the receptive fields of both fibers are stimulated only by the temperature $T_{cool}$.\n\nThe core of the illusion is that the simultaneous stimulation from the adjacent warm bars ($T_{warm}$) causes a central disinhibition, reducing the effectiveness of the A-delta fiber's inhibitory synapse. In this model, this effect is represented as a 35.0% reduction in the inhibitory weight $W_{A\\delta}$.\n\nAssuming a receptive field is stimulated by the cool bar temperature ($T_{cool}$) while simultaneously being subject to this 35.0% disinhibitory effect from the adjacent warm bars, calculate the resulting activity $A_{pain}$ of the second-order neuron.
