It is scientifically grounded in the biophysics of hearing, using a standard and appropriate simplified model (a lumped mass-spring oscillator) to represent a segment of the basilar membrane. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and definitions to derive the requested relationship and compute the specified ratio. The variables and conditions are clearly defined and do not contain contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nWe begin by modeling a small segment of the basilar membrane at position $x$ as a simple, undamped mass-spring system. Let $y$ be the transverse displacement of the segment from its equilibrium position. According to Hooke's Law, the restoring force $F_s$ exerted by the spring-like element is proportional to the displacement and directed opposite to it:\n$$F_s = -k(x)y$$\nwhere $k(x)$ is the effective stiffness at position $x$.\n\nAccording to Newton's second law of motion, the net force on the segment equals its mass times its acceleration. For this system, the only force is the restoring force. The mass is the effective mass $m(x)$ and the acceleration is the second derivative of displacement with respect to time, $\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}$.\n$$F_{net} = m(x) \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}$$\nEquating the net force to the restoring force gives the equation of motion for the segment:\n$$m(x) \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = -k(x)y$$\nThis can be rearranged into the standard form for a simple harmonic oscillator:\n$$\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + \\frac{k(x)}{m(x)}y = 0$$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation. The general solution describes simple harmonic motion, $y(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$, where the squared angular frequency of oscillation, $\\omega^2$, is the coefficient of the $y$ term. Thus, the natural angular frequency of resonance for this segment is:\n$$\\omega(x)^2 = \\frac{k(x)}{m(x)} \\implies \\omega(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{k(x)}{m(x)}}$$\nThe problem states that the Characteristic Frequency (CF), denoted $f(x)$, corresponds to this local resonance frequency. The relationship between angular frequency $\\omega$ (in radians per second) and frequency $f$ (in Hertz) is $\\omega = 2\\pi f$. Therefore, we can express the CF as:\n$$f(x) = \\frac{\\omega(x)}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{k(x)}{m(x)}}$$\nThis completes the first part of the derivation, showing how $f(x)$ depends on $k(x)$ and $m(x)$.\n\nNext, we analyze the effect of the pathological change. Let the original, \"old\" state be described by parameters $m_{\\text{old}}(x) = m(x)$ and $k_{\\text{old}}(x) = k(x)$, with the corresponding frequency:\n$$f_{\\text{old}}(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\text{old}}(x)}{m_{\\text{old}}(x)}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{k(x)}{m(x)}}$$\nThe problem specifies the new parameters after the pathological change:\nA $10\\%$ reduction in stiffness means the new stiffness, $k_{\\text{new}}(x)$, is $100\\% - 10\\% = 90\\%$ of the old stiffness.\n$$k_{\\text{new}}(x) = (1 - 0.10)k(x) = 0.90k(x)$$\nA $5\\%$ increase in effective mass means the new mass, $m_{\\text{new}}(x)$, is $100\\% + 5\\% = 105\\%$ of the old mass.\n$$m_{\\text{new}}(x) = (1 + 0.05)m(x) = 1.05m(x)$$\nThe new resonance frequency, $f_{\\text{new}}(x)$, is found by substituting these new parameters into the frequency formula:\n$$f_{\\text{new}}(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\text{new}}(x)}{m_{\\text{new}}(x)}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{0.90k(x)}{1.05m(x)}}$$\nWe are asked to compute the dimensionless multiplicative change, which is the ratio $\\frac{f_{\\text{new}}(x)}{f_{\\text{old}}(x)}$:\n$$\\frac{f_{\\text{new}}(x)}{f_{\\text{old}}(x)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{0.90k(x)}{1.05m(x)}}}{\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{k(x)}{m(x)}}}$$\nThe constant term $\\frac{1}{2\\pi}$ cancels out. We can combine the square roots:\n$$\\frac{f_{\\text{new}}(x)}{f_{\\text{old}}(x)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{0.90k(x)}{1.05m(x)}}{\\frac{k(x)}{m(x)}}}$$\nThe terms $k(x)$ and $m(x)$ also cancel, leaving a purely numerical ratio:\n$$\\frac{f_{\\text{new}}(x)}{f_{\\text{old}}(x)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.90}{1.05}}$$\nTo simplify this exact expression, we can write the decimal numbers as fractions: $\\frac{0.90}{1.05} = \\frac{90/100}{105/100} = \\frac{90}{105}$. We can simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $15$:\n$$90 \\div 15 = 6$$\n$$105 \\div 15 = 7$$\nSo, the fraction simplifies to $\\frac{6}{7}$. The ratio of frequencies is therefore:\n$$\\frac{f_{\\text{new}}(x)}{f_{\\text{old}}(x)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6}{7}}$$\nTo interpret this result, we note that the fraction $\\frac{6}{7}$ is less than $1$. Consequently, its square root, $\\sqrt{\\frac{6}{7}}$, is also a number less than $1$. This means that $f_{\\text{new}}(x) < f_{\\text{old}}(x)$. The Characteristic Frequency at the affected position has decreased.

The fifth digit is $1$, so we round down.\n$$f(10) \\approx 512.9\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\n\n### Part 2: Critique of the Anatomical Accuracy Limits\n\nThe Greenwood-like function $f(x)=A\\left(10^{a x}-k\\right)$ with a single set of parameters ($A$, $a$, $k$) represents a population-averaged, idealized model of the human cochlea. Its application to any specific individual is subject to limitations stemming from inter-individual anatomical variability. Below are two such limitation mechanisms grounded in the anatomy and biophysics of the inner ear.\n\n**1. Variability in Cochlear Duct Length:**\nThe model defines position $x$ as an absolute distance in millimeters from the cochlear apex. However, the total length of the human cochlear duct is not constant across individuals, with reported values typically ranging from approximately $29\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ to $40\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The provided function, with its fixed parameters, implicitly assumes a standard cochlear length. For an individual whose cochlea is significantly shorter or longer than this standard, the tonotopic map will be correspondingly compressed or expanded.\n\nConsider the fixed position $x=10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. In a shorter-than-average cochlea (e.g., $30\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ long), this point is one-third of the way along the BM from the apex. In a longer-than-average cochlea (e.g., $36\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ long), it is only about $28\\%$ of the way along. Since the mechanical gradient of stiffness and mass is distributed over the entire length of the BM, a given *fractional* distance from the apex, rather than a fixed *absolute* distance, is more likely to correlate with a consistent set of mechanical properties and thus a consistent CF. Therefore, applying a single map based on absolute distance to individuals with different cochlear lengths introduces systematic error, as the same absolute position $x$ corresponds to different biophysical environments.\n\n**2. Variability in Basilar Membrane Mechanical Properties and Boundary Conditions:**\nThe tonotopic map is a direct physical consequence of the continuous gradient in the BM's mechanical properties, primarily its stiffness and mass. The parameter $a$ in the Greenwood function empirically captures this gradient, assuming a smooth, uniform exponential change along the cochlea's length. This is an idealization.\n\nIn reality, the local mechanical properties of the BM are determined by its microscopic anatomy, such as its width and thickness, which can vary between individuals even at the same fractional location along the cochlea. For example, two individuals with identical cochlear lengths might have different BM width profiles. A wider BM at a given location, all else being equal, would exhibit lower stiffness, resulting in a lower resonant frequency (CF) than predicted by the idealized model. The model's use of a single, constant parameter $a$ fails to capture such local or individual-specific deviations from a perfect exponential gradient.\n\nFurthermore, the model's accuracy is limited by idealized boundary conditions. At the apex ($x=0$), the scala vestibuli and scala tympani connect via the helicotrema. The size, geometry, and resulting acoustic impedance of the helicotrema vary among individuals. This variability affects the low-frequency response of the cochlea and the mechanics at the apical end. The parameter $k$ is a simple offset to enforce an apical boundary condition, but it cannot account for the complex fluidic-mechanical interactions at a variable helicotrema, thereby limiting the model's accuracy, particularly for low frequencies.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{512.9}\n$$", "id": "5003523"}, {"introduction": "A direct consequence of tonotopic organization is that each auditory nerve fiber is sharply tuned to a specific characteristic frequency ($f_c$).
