The excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) arises from a monosynaptic retinal ganglion cell input onto the LGN relay neuron, whereas a disynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) arises when retinal ganglion cells excite an LGN interneuron that, in turn, inhibits the relay neuron. The onset latency of a postsynaptic current is the sum of conduction times along the activated axonal segments and the synaptic delays incurred at each chemical synapse. Use only the following fundamental bases: conduction time equals distance divided by velocity, $t = d/v$, and each chemical synapse contributes an identical synaptic release-and-transduction delay $t_s$.\n\nAn experiment stimulates the retina at $t = 0$, and records from a single LGN relay neuron. The measured EPSC onset latency is $t_E = 2.6$ ms, and the measured disynaptic IPSC onset latency is $t_I = 5.2$ ms. The axonal path length from the retinal ganglion cell to the LGN (retinogeniculate axon) is $d_{RG} = 0.03$ m with conduction velocity $v_{RG} = 15$ m/s.

The conduction time, $t_{cond}$, is given by the formula $t_{cond} = d/v$, where $d$ is distance and $v$ is velocity. Each chemical synapse introduces a fixed delay, $t_s$.\n\nFirst, we formalize the latencies for the excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) and the inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) based on the described pathways.\n\nThe EPSC pathway is monosynaptic, involving one axonal conduction segment from the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) to the LGN relay neuron and one synapse. The latency, $t_E$, is therefore:\n$$t_E = t_{cond, RG} + t_s$$\nwhere $t_{cond, RG}$ is the conduction time along the retinogeniculate axon.\n\nThe IPSC pathway is disynaptic. It involves the RGC axon exciting an LGN interneuron, which then inhibits the relay neuron. This pathway includes two conduction segments and two synapses. The latency, $t_I$, is:\n$$t_I = t_{cond, RG} + t_s + t_{cond, INH} + t_s$$\nwhich simplifies to:\n$$t_I = t_{cond, RG} + t_{cond, INH} + 2t_s$$\nwhere $t_{cond, INH}$ is the conduction time along the LGN interneuron's axon.\n\nNext, we calculate the conduction times using the provided data.\nThe retinogeniculate conduction time is:\n$$t_{cond, RG} = \\frac{d_{RG}}{v_{RG}} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ m}}{15 \\text{ m/s}} = 0.002 \\text{ s}$$\nConverting this to milliseconds, we have $0.002 \\text{ s} \\times 1000 \\text{ ms/s} = 2.0 \\text{ ms}$.\n\nThe LGN interneuron axon conduction time is:\n$$t_{cond, INH} = \\frac{d_{INH}}{v_{INH}} = \\frac{0.0012 \\text{ m}}{0.6 \\text{ m/s}} = 0.002 \\text{ s}$$\nThis is also equivalent to $2.0 \\text{ ms}$.\n\nNow we can use the equation for the EPSC latency, $t_E$, to solve for the synaptic delay, $t_s$.

The flow of information is parallel and \"forward\".\nFeedback inhibition occurs when a principal neuron, upon becoming active, excites an inhibitory interneuron that subsequently inhibits the principal neuron itself, forming a recurrent inhibitory loop.\n\nThe problem states that \"retinal ganglion cells excite an LGN interneuron that, in turn, inhibits the relay neuron\". This is happening concurrently with the direct excitation of the relay neuron by the same class of retinal ganglion cells. The input source (retina) drives both the excitatory pathway (RGC $\\rightarrow$ Relay Neuron) and the inhibitory pathway (RGC $\\rightarrow$ Interneuron $\\rightarrow$ Relay Neuron). The relay neuron does not send a collateral to excite the interneuron. This circuit configuration is the canonical definition of feedforward inhibition. The temporal structure, where excitation ($t_E = 2.6$ ms) precedes inhibition ($t_I = 5.2$ ms), is a functional hallmark of this motif, allowing the inhibition to shape the temporal window of the excitatory response.
