The parameters provided are scientifically plausible for the specified biological context.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe first step is to derive an expression for the characteristic time scale, $\\tau$, for diffusion over a distance $L$. The process is governed by Fick's second law, which in one dimension is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C(x,t)}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C(x,t)}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nwhere $C(x,t)$ is the concentration of the tastant at position $x$ and time $t$, and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nTo find the characteristic time scale, we use dimensional analysis. The physical quantities involved have the following dimensions, where $[L]$ denotes length and $[T]$ denotes time:\n- Position $x$: $[x] = [L]$\n- Time $t$: $[t] = [T]$\n- Diffusion coefficient $D$: $[D] = [L]^2 [T]^{-1}$\n\nThe problem has a single characteristic length scale, the pore length $L$. We seek a characteristic time scale, $\\tau$, that can be constructed from $L$ and $D$. We propose a relationship of the form:\n$$\n\\tau \\propto L^a D^b\n$$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are dimensionless exponents. To ensure dimensional consistency, the dimensions on both sides must match:\n$$\n[T] = ([L])^a ([L]^2 [T]^{-1})^b = [L]^{a+2b} [T]^{-b}\n$$\nEquating the exponents for each fundamental dimension:\n- For time $[T]$: $1 = -b \\implies b = -1$\n- For length $[L]$: $0 = a+2b \\implies a = -2b = -2(-1) = 2$\n\nThus, the characteristic time scale must be proportional to $L^2/D$. By convention in such scaling arguments, the proportionality constant is taken to be of order unity. We define the characteristic time as:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{L^2}{D}\n$$\nThis expression represents the typical time it takes for a particle to diffuse across a distance $L$.\n\nThe second step is to find an expression for the diffusion coefficient, $D$. The problem instructs us to use the Stokes-Einstein relation, which describes the diffusion of a spherical particle of radius $r$ in a fluid of viscosity $\\eta$ at absolute temperature $T$:\n$$\nD = \\frac{k_B T}{6 \\pi \\eta r}\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nCombining the two expressions, we obtain a formula for the characteristic time $\\tau$ in terms of the given physical parameters:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{L^2}{D} = \\frac{L^2}{\\left( \\frac{k_B T}{6 \\pi \\eta r} \\right)} = \\frac{6 \\pi \\eta r L^2}{k_B T}\n$$\nThe final step is to compute the numerical value of $\\tau$.

It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe primary task is to derive the sensitivity $S_{\\mathrm{th}}(n)$ and then calculate the ratio of sensitivities for Hill coefficients $n=2$ and $n=1$.\n\nFirst, we must find the derivative of the firing rate function $F(C)$ with respect to the concentration $C$. The function is:\n$$ F(C) = \\dfrac{F_{\\max} C^{n}}{K_{d}^{n} + C^{n}} $$\nWe use the quotient rule for differentiation, which states that for a function $f(x) = \\frac{u(x)}{v(x)}$, its derivative is $f'(x) = \\frac{u'(x)v(x) - u(x)v'(x)}{[v(x)]^2}$.\nLet $u(C) = F_{\\max} C^{n}$ and $v(C) = K_{d}^{n} + C^{n}$.\nThe derivatives of $u(C)$ and $v(C)$ with respect to $C$ are:\n$$ \\dfrac{du}{dC} = n F_{\\max} C^{n-1} $$\n$$ \\dfrac{dv}{dC} = n C^{n-1} $$\nApplying the quotient rule:\n$$ \\dfrac{dF}{dC} = \\dfrac{(n F_{\\max} C^{n-1})(K_{d}^{n} + C^{n}) - (F_{\\max} C^{n})(n C^{n-1})}{(K_{d}^{n} + C^{n})^2} $$\nWe can simplify the numerator by factoring out the common term $n F_{\\max} C^{n-1}$:\n$$ \\dfrac{dF}{dC} = \\dfrac{n F_{\\max} C^{n-1} [(K_{d}^{n} + C^{n}) - C^{n}]}{(K_{d}^{n} + C^{n})^2} $$\nThe $C^n$ terms in the bracket cancel out:\n$$ \\dfrac{dF}{dC} = \\dfrac{n F_{\\max} C^{n-1} K_{d}^{n}}{(K_{d}^{n} + C^{n})^2} $$\nThis expression represents the slope of the dose-response curve at any concentration $C$.\n\nThe sensitivity at the threshold, $S_{\\mathrm{th}}(n)$, is defined as this derivative evaluated at $C = K_{d}$:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{th}}(n) = \\left.\\dfrac{dF}{dC}\\right|_{C = K_{d}} = \\dfrac{n F_{\\max} (K_{d})^{n-1} K_{d}^{n}}{(K_{d}^{n} + (K_{d})^{n})^2} $$\nNow we simplify this expression. In the numerator, we combine the powers of $K_{d}$:\n$$ (K_{d})^{n-1} K_{d}^{n} = K_{d}^{(n-1)+n} = K_{d}^{2n-1} $$\nIn the denominator, we combine the terms inside the parenthesis:\n$$ (K_{d}^{n} + K_{d}^{n})^2 = (2 K_{d}^{n})^2 = 4 (K_{d}^{n})^2 = 4 K_{d}^{2n} $$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $S_{\\mathrm{th}}(n)$:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{th}}(n) = \\dfrac{n F_{\\max} K_{d}^{2n-1}}{4 K_{d}^{2n}} $$\nUsing the law of exponents $\\frac{a^x}{a^y} = a^{x-y}$, we simplify the $K_d$ terms:\n$$ \\dfrac{K_{d}^{2n-1}}{K_{d}^{2n}} = K_{d}^{(2n-1) - 2n} = K_{d}^{-1} = \\dfrac{1}{K_{d}} $$\nThus, the final expression for the sensitivity at the threshold is:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{th}}(n) = \\dfrac{n F_{\\max}}{4 K_{d}} $$\nThis shows that the sensitivity at $C=K_d$ is directly proportional to the Hill coefficient.\n\nNext, we must compute the multiplicative change in sensitivity when $n$ increases from $1$ to $2$. This is the ratio $\\dfrac{S_{\\mathrm{th}}(2)}{S_{\\mathrm{th}}(1)}$.\nUsing our derived formula for $S_{\\mathrm{th}}(n)$:\nFor $n = 1$:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{th}}(1) = \\dfrac{(1) F_{\\max}}{4 K_{d}} = \\dfrac{F_{\\max}}{4 K_{d}} $$\nFor $n = 2$:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{th}}(2) = \\dfrac{(2) F_{\\max}}{4 K_{d}} = \\dfrac{F_{\\max}}{2 K_{d}} $$\nNow, we calculate the ratio:\n$$ \\dfrac{S_{\\mathrm{th}}(2)}{S_{\\mathrm{th}}(1)} = \\dfrac{\\frac{F_{\\max}}{2 K_{d}}}{\\frac{F_{\\max}}{4 K_{d}}} $$\nThe constants $F_{\\max}$ and $K_{d}$ are fixed and non-zero, so they cancel out:\n$$ \\dfrac{S_{\\mathrm{th}}(2)}{S_{\\mathrm{th}}(1)} = \\dfrac{1/2}{1/4} = \\dfrac{1}{2} \\times \\dfrac{4}{1} = 2 $$\nThe multiplicative change in sensitivity is $2$.\n\nFinally, we provide a brief interpretation. The sensitivity, as the slope of the response curve, quantifies how much the neural firing rate changes for a small change in stimulus concentration. An increase in the Hill coefficient $n$ from $1$ to $2$ doubles this sensitivity at the detection threshold ($C=K_d$). This means that for a small change in sucrose concentration near $K_d$, the afferent nerve fibers will exhibit a twofold larger change in their firing rate. This amplified signal is then transmitted to the Nucleus of the Solitary Tract (NTS) and relayed to higher brain centers like the gustatory cortex. A larger neural signal difference for a given stimulus difference enhances the system's ability to discriminate between similar concentrations, making the system act more like a sharp, switch-like detector. Therefore, higher cooperativity ($n > 1$) in receptor activation leads to enhanced sensory discrimination near the threshold.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "5069198"}, {"introduction": "The brain doesn't interpret taste based on one neuron's signal, but rather on the collective activity of a large population.

It can be written as $X^{(B)} = c d^{\\top}$ with $c=[1, 0, 0, 0]^{\\top}$ and $d=[10/3, -5/3, -5/3]^{\\top}$.\nThus, only the first singular value $\\sigma_1$ is non-zero. The first left singular vector $u_1$ is the normalized vector $c$:\n$$\nu_1 = \\frac{c}{\\|c\\|_2} = \\frac{[1, 0, 0, 0]^{\\top}}{\\sqrt{1^2+0^2+0^2+0^2}} = [1, 0, 0, 0]^{\\top}.\n$$\n(Note: SVD algorithms may yield $[-1, 0, 0, 0]^{\\top}$, but the PR is invariant to sign changes as it uses the fourth power).\n\n**Step 3: Participation Ratios**\nAs only $\\sigma_1$ is non-zero, $\\mathrm{PR}_2 = 0$ and $\\mathrm{PR}_3 = 0$.\nWe compute $\\mathrm{PR}_1$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PR}_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^{4} (u_1(i))^4} = \\frac{1}{1^4 + 0^4 + 0^4 + 0^4} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1.\n$$\nThe values for Case B are $\\mathrm{PR}_1 = 1.000000$, $\\mathrm{PR}_2 = 0.000000$, $\\mathrm{PR}_3 = 0.000000$.\n\n### Case C\n\nThe given response matrix is:\n$$\nR^{(C)} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n2 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n2 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\nHere, $N=3$ and $M=4$.\n\n**Step 1: Mean-Centering**\nEach neuron's response is constant across all tastants. The mean for each row is $(2+2+2+2)/4 = 2$.\nSubtracting the mean from each element results in a matrix of zeros:\n$$\nX^{(C)} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Singular Value Decomposition**\nThe SVD of a zero matrix results in all singular values being zero. Thus, $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_3 = 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Participation Ratios**\nAccording to the problem statement, if a singular value is not strictly positive (i.e., is zero or within numerical tolerance of zero), the corresponding participation ratio is defined as $0$. Since $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3$ are all zero, we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PR}_1 = 0, \\quad \\mathrm{PR}_2 = 0, \\quad \\mathrm{PR}_3 = 0.\n$$\nThe values for Case C are $\\mathrm{PR}_1 = 0.000000$, $\\mathrm{PR}_2 = 0.000000$, $\\mathrm{PR}_3 = 0.000000$.\n\n### Summary of Results\nThe computed participation ratios, rounded to $6$ decimal places, are:\n- Case A: $[\\mathrm{3.275510, 0.000000, 0.000000}]$\n- Case B: $[\\mathrm{1.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000}]$\n- Case C: $[\\mathrm{0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000}]$\nThese will be combined into a single list for the final output.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n# No other libraries are used.\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the problem for all test cases and print the final result.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A\n        np.array([\n            [4, 4, 0, 0],\n            [3, 3, 0, 0],\n            [0, 0, 5, 5],\n            [0, 0, 6, 6],\n            [1, 1, 1, 1]\n        ], dtype=float),\n        # Case B\n        np.array([\n            [5, 0, 0],\n            [1, 1, 1],\n            [1, 1, 1],\n            [1, 1, 1]\n        ], dtype=float),\n        # Case C\n        np.array([\n            [2, 2, 2, 2],\n            [2, 2, 2, 2],\n            [2, 2, 2, 2]\n        ], dtype=float)\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n    \n    # Define a numerical tolerance to check for non-zero singular values.\n    # Standard machine epsilon for float64 is ~2.22e-16.
