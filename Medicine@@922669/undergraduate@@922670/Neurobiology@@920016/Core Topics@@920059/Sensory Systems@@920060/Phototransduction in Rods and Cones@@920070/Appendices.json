The problem is approached by applying the fundamental definition provided: the total number of substrate molecules converted equals the product of the catalytic rate and the time of activity.\n\nLet $N_{\\text{cGMP}}$ be the total number of cGMP molecules hydrolyzed. This quantity can be expressed as the product of the total rate of cGMP hydrolysis and the duration over which this hydrolysis occurs.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of active enzyme units. The problem states that a single $R^*$ activates $N_{T}$ transducin molecules. It is also given that each activated transducin produces one activated phosphodiesterase (PDE6) catalytic unit. Therefore, the number of activated PDE6 units, which we can denote as $N_{\\text{PDE}^*}$, is equal to the number of activated transducin molecules, $N_{T}$.\n$$N_{\\text{PDE}^*} = N_{T}$$\nGiven the value $N_{T} = 100$, we have:\n$$N_{\\text{PDE}^*} = 100$$\n\nSecond, we determine the total catalytic rate of cGMP hydrolysis. The rate for a single activated PDE6 unit is given as $k_{\\text{cat}}$. With $N_{\\text{PDE}^*}$ active units acting in parallel, the total rate of hydrolysis, $V_{\\text{total}}$, is the product of the number of active units and the rate per unit.\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = N_{\\text{PDE}^*} \\times k_{\\text{cat}}$$\nSubstituting $N_{\\text{PDE}^*} = N_T$, we get:\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = N_{T} \\times k_{\\text{cat}}$$\n\nThird, we use the provided fundamental definition to calculate the total number of hydrolyzed molecules. The problem states to assume that the PDE6 units are active for a duration equal to the lifetime of $R^*$, which is $\\tau_{R}$. Thus, the total number of cGMP molecules hydrolyzed, $N_{\\text{cGMP}}$, is the product of the total rate $V_{\\text{total}}$ and the duration $\\tau_{R}$.\n$$N_{\\text{cGMP}} = V_{\\text{total}} \\times \\tau_{R}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $V_{\\text{total}}$, we arrive at the general formula:\n$$N_{\\text{cGMP}} = (N_{T} \\times k_{\\text{cat}}) \\times \\tau_{R}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this equation. The given values are:\n-   Number of activated transducins, $N_{T} = 100$.\n-   Catalytic rate per PDE6, $k_{\\text{cat}} = 2000 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n-   Lifetime of $R^*$, $\\tau_{R} = 50\\,\\text{ms}$.\n\nBefore performing the calculation, we must ensure consistency of units. The catalytic rate $k_{\\text{cat}}$ is given in units of inverse seconds ($\\text{s}^{-1}$), while the lifetime $\\tau_{R}$ is in milliseconds ($\\text{ms}$). We convert $\\tau_{R}$ to seconds:\n$$\\tau_{R} = 50\\,\\text{ms} = 50 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{s} = 0.05\\,\\text{s}$$\n\nWe can now calculate $N_{\\text{cGMP}}$:\n$$N_{\\text{cGMP}} = 100 \\times 2000\\,\\text{s}^{-1} \\times 0.05\\,\\text{s}$$\n$$N_{\\text{cGMP}} = 200000\\,\\text{s}^{-1} \\times 0.05\\,\\text{s}$$\n$$N_{\\text{cGMP}} = (2 \\times 10^{5}) \\times (5 \\times 10^{-2})$$\n$$N_{\\text{cGMP}} = (2 \\times 5) \\times 10^{5-2}$$\n$$N_{\\text{cGMP}} = 10 \\times 10^{3}$$\n$$N_{\\text{cGMP}} = 10000$$\n\nThe result is $10000$ molecules.

A single photon creates an initial amount of $R^*$, which we can treat as an impulse. The amount of $R^*$ then decays with a first-order rate constant $\\alpha$.\n$$ A(t) = A_0 e^{-\\alpha t} $$\nwhere $A_0$ represents the initial amount of $R^*$ produced.\n\nLet $B(t)$ be the concentration or amount of the active transducin–PDE6 complex.

Its derivative is negative for $x>1$, which is the physiological case. Therefore, $t_{peak}$ is a decreasing function of $\\beta$. As RGS9 overexpression increases $\\beta$, $t_{peak}$ **decreases**, meaning the time-to-peak occurs earlier.\n\nTo find the peak amplitude, we evaluate the response at $t_{peak}$. A standard result for this kinetic scheme shows that the peak amplitude is proportional to:\n$$ B_{peak} \\propto \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}\\right)^{\\frac{-\\beta}{\\beta - \\alpha}} $$\nAnalyzing the logarithm of this function with respect to $x = \\beta/\\alpha$ shows that its derivative is negative.
