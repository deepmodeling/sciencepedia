The system consists of $N$ identical and independent two-state mechanotransduction (MET) channels. Each channel can be either closed or open. Let $p$ be the probability that a single channel is in the open state. The number of open channels, denoted by the random variable $n_o$, follows a binomial distribution, $n_o \\sim B(N, p)$.\n\nThe mean and variance of a binomially distributed random variable are well-known. The mean number of open channels is given by:\n$$\n\\langle n_o \\rangle = Np\n$$\nAnd the variance in the number of open channels is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(n_o) = \\langle (n_o - \\langle n_o \\rangle)^2 \\rangle = Np(1-p)\n$$\nUnder voltage clamp, each open channel contributes a constant single-channel current, $i$. The total macroscopic MET current, $I_{\\mathrm{macro}}$, is also a random variable, given by $I_{\\mathrm{macro}} = i \\cdot n_o$. The mean macroscopic current, which we will denote as $I$ following the problem statement, is:\n$$\nI = \\langle I_{\\mathrm{macro}} \\rangle = \\langle i \\cdot n_o \\rangle = i \\langle n_o \\rangle = iNp\n$$\nThe intrinsic variance of the macroscopic current, $\\sigma_{I}^{2}$, which arises from the stochastic gating of the channels, is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{I}^{2} = \\mathrm{Var}(I_{\\mathrm{macro}}) = \\mathrm{Var}(i \\cdot n_o) = i^2 \\mathrm{Var}(n_o) = i^2 Np(1-p)\n$$\nOur first task is to derive the relationship between the intrinsic current variance $\\sigma_{I}^{2}$ and the mean current $I$. We can do this by eliminating the open probability $p$ from the equations. From the equation for the mean current, we can express $p$ as:\n$$\np = \\frac{I}{iN}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $p$ into the equation for the variance $\\sigma_{I}^{2}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{I}^{2} = i^2 N \\left( \\frac{I}{iN} \\right) \\left( 1 - \\frac{I}{iN} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the desired relationship:\n$$\n\\sigma_{I}^{2} = iI \\left( 1 - \\frac{I}{iN} \\right) = iI - \\frac{I^2}{N}\n$$\nThis equation shows that the intrinsic variance $\\sigma_{I}^{2}$ is a parabolic function of the mean current $I$.\n\nThe total measured variance, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{meas}}^{2}$, is the sum of the intrinsic variance and the constant background variance $\\sigma_{b}^{2}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{meas}}^{2}(I) = \\sigma_{b}^{2} + \\sigma_{I}^{2} = \\sigma_{b}^{2} + iI - \\frac{I^2}{N}\n$$\nNext, we express the small-$I$ slope $S$ and the peak location $I_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ in terms of $i$ and $N$. The slope of the variance-mean curve, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{meas}}^{2}$ versus $I$, is given by the derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma_{\\mathrm{meas}}^{2}}{dI} = \\frac{d}{dI} \\left( \\sigma_{b}^{2} + iI - \\frac{I^2}{N} \\right) = i - \\frac{2I}{N}\n$$\nThe problem defines $S$ as the slope of this curve for small $I$.

The problem is therefore valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe solution is divided into two calculations as requested, followed by a brief interpretation.\n\n**1. Calculation of Single-Channel Conductance ($g$)**\n\nThe problem states that the single-channel current-voltage relationship follows Ohm's law:\n$$i = g(V - V_{\\text{rev}})$$\nwhere $i$ is the single-channel current, $g$ is the single-channel conductance, $V$ is the membrane potential, and $V_{\\text{rev}}$ is the reversal potential.\n\nWe are given the following values from the monovalent-dominated measurement:\n- Membrane potential, $V = -80.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n- Reversal potential, $V_{\\text{rev, mono}} = 0.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n- Single-channel open current amplitude, $|i_{\\text{open}}| = 12.0\\,\\mathrm{pA}$\n\nBy convention, inward current (flow of positive charge into the cell) is negative. Since the membrane potential ($V = -80.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) is negative relative to the reversal potential ($V_{\\text{rev, mono}} = 0.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$), the net flow of cations will be into the cell, constituting an inward current. Therefore, the current $i$ is $i_{\\text{open}} = -12.0\\,\\mathrm{pA}$.\n\nWe can rearrange Ohm's law to solve for the conductance $g$:\n$$g = \\frac{i}{V - V_{\\text{rev}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$g = \\frac{-12.0\\,\\mathrm{pA}}{-80.0\\,\\mathrm{mV} - 0.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}} = \\frac{-12.0\\,\\mathrm{pA}}{-80.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}} = 0.150\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{pA}}{\\mathrm{mV}}$$\nTo express the conductance in picoSiemens ($\\mathrm{pS}$), we note that $1\\,\\mathrm{pA}/\\mathrm{mV} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{pS}$.

Calculation of Permeability Ratio ($P_K/P_{Ca}$)**\n\nThe Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) constant-field model is used to relate the reversal potential to ionic concentrations and permeabilities. At the reversal potential ($V_{\\text{rev}}$), the net ionic current across the membrane is zero. For a membrane permeable to potassium ($K^{+}$) and calcium ($\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$), this means $I_K + I_{Ca} = 0$.\n\nThe GHK current equation for an ion species $j$ with valence $z_j$ is:\n$$I_j = P_j z_j^2 \\frac{F^2 V}{RT} \\frac{[j]_{\\text{i}} - [j]_{\\text{o}} \\exp(-z_j V F / RT)}{1 - \\exp(-z_j V F / RT)}$$\nwhere $P_j$ is the permeability, $[j]_{\\text{i}}$ and $[j]_{\\text{o}}$ are the internal and external concentrations, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

Interpretation**\n\nThe calculated permeability ratio $P_K/P_{Ca}$ of approximately $0.190$ indicates that the MET channel is significantly more permeable to $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ than to $K^{+}$ ($P_{Ca}/P_K \\approx 5.3$). Under physiological conditions, the hair bundle is bathed in endolymph, which has a very high $K^{+}$ concentration (around $150\\,\\mathrm{mM}$) and a low $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration (tens of $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$). Despite the low external $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration, the high relative permeability of the MET channel to $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ensures a substantial influx of calcium ions whenever the channel opens. This influx leads to the formation of a high-concentration calcium \"microdomain\" in the cytoplasm just beneath the channel pore. This local, rapid rise in intracellular calcium is the critical signal that mediates fast adaptation of the MET apparatus, a key process for adjusting the hair cell's sensitivity to mechanical stimuli.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1.50 \\times 10^2 & 0.190 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5022910"}, {"introduction": "Hair cells don't just respond to stimuli; they actively adjust their sensitivity over time through a process called adaptation.

In a paired-step protocol, two identical positive bundle deflections are applied, separated by an interpulse interval at rest.

Assume the following experimentally justified base principles: (i) at rest (between steps), the local calcium concentration that drives fast adaptation relaxes back to baseline by first-order clearance kinetics, and (ii) the instantaneous suppression of the MET peak current by fast adaptation is linearly proportional to the residual adaptation drive set by local calcium. Slow adaptation mechanisms are pharmacologically blocked, and leak currents are subtracted.\n\nAn experiment is performed as follows. The first bundle step begins at time $t=0$ and lasts long enough to reach a steady plateau.

It is scientifically grounded in the established biophysics of hair cell mechanoelectrical transduction, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, formalizable language.\n\nThe solution proceeds by mathematically formalizing the two provided base principles.\n\nLet $I(t)$ be the mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) current at time $t$. Let $C(t)$ represent the local calcium concentration that drives fast adaptation, relative to its baseline resting concentration. We can set the resting concentration to zero, $C_{rest}=0$.\n\nPrinciple (ii) states that the instantaneous suppression of the MET peak current is linearly proportional to the residual adaptation drive set by local calcium. The unadapted peak current, evoked from a fully rested state, is given as $I_{0}$. The suppression at any moment is the difference between this maximal current and the observed peak current, $I_{peak}$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$I_{0} - I_{peak} = k C(t)$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality. This can be rearranged to express the peak current obtainable at time $t$:\n$$I_{peak}(t) = I_{0} - k C(t)$$\n\nThe first stimulus is applied at $t=0$. At this point, the hair cell is fully rested, so the adapting calcium concentration is at its baseline, $C(0) = 0$. The peak current evoked is:\n$$I_{peak}(0) = I_{0} - k C(0) = I_{0}$$\nThe problem states this value is $I_{0} = 400 \\text{ pA}$.\n\nDuring this first long stimulus step, the MET current adapts and settles to a steady-state plateau, $I_{\\mathrm{pl}}$. At this plateau, the calcium concentration has also reached a steady-state level, which we denote as $C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$. The current suppression is now maximal for the given stimulus. By treating the plateau as the limit of an adapting peak, we can relate it to $C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{pl}} = I_{0} - k C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$$\nThis equation allows us to characterize the maximal adaptation effect. We can rearrange it to find the term $k C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$k C_{\\mathrm{ss}} = I_{0} - I_{\\mathrm{pl}}$$\n\nAfter the first stimulus ends, the system is allowed to rest for an interpulse interval of duration $\\Delta t$. According to principle (i), the calcium concentration $C(t')$ during this rest period (where $t'$ is time since the start of the interval) decays with first-order kinetics. The governing differential equation is:\n$$\\frac{dC}{dt'} = -\\frac{C}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}}$$\nwhere $\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$ is the calcium clearance time constant. The initial condition for this decay is the steady-state concentration reached at the end of the first pulse, $C(t'=0) = C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$. The solution to this first-order linear ordinary differential equation is:\n$$C(t') = C_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t'}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}}\\right)$$\n\nThe second identical stimulus is applied at the end of the interpulse interval, i.e., at $t' = \\Delta t$. The residual calcium concentration at this moment is:\n$$C(\\Delta t) = C_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}}\\right)$$\nThe peak current of this second step, $I_{2}$, will be suppressed by this residual calcium:\n$$I_{2} = I_{0} - k C(\\Delta t)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C(\\Delta t)$:\n$$I_{2} = I_{0} - k \\left( C_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}}\\right) \\right) = I_{0} - (k C_{\\mathrm{ss}}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}}\\right)$$\nWe can now substitute the expression for $k C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ derived from the first pulse's plateau: $k C_{\\mathrm{ss}} = I_{0} - I_{\\mathrm{pl}}$. This yields the desired expression for $I_{2}$ as a function of $\\Delta t$ and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$:\n$$I_{2}(\\Delta t, \\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}) = I_{0} - (I_{0} - I_{\\mathrm{pl}}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}}\\right)$$\nThis expression describes the recovery from adaptation.\n\nThe next task is to use the provided numerical data to compute $\\tau_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$.
