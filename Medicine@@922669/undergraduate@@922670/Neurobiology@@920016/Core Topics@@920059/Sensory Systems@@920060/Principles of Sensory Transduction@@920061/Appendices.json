The equation is:\n$$\\frac{dv(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau} v(t) = \\frac{1}{C} i_{\\text{in}}(t)$$\n\n**1. Impulse Response, $h(t)$**\nThe impulse response $h(t)$ is the output $v(t)$ when the input is the Dirac delta distribution, $i_{\\text{in}}(t) = \\delta(t)$. The equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{dh(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau} h(t) = \\frac{1}{C} \\delta(t)$$\nWe solve this using the Laplace transform, with $H(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t)\\}$. Assuming causality and the initial condition $h(0^{-}) = v(0^{-}) = 0$:\n$$\\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\frac{dh(t)}{dt}\\right\\} + \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t)\\} = \\frac{1}{C} \\mathcal{L}\\{\\delta(t)\\}$$\n$$(sH(s) - h(0^{-})) + \\frac{1}{\\tau} H(s) = \\frac{1}{C} (1)$$\n$$sH(s) + \\frac{1}{\\tau} H(s) = \\frac{1}{C}$$\n$$H(s) \\left(s + \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\right) = \\frac{1}{C}$$\nThe transfer function $H(s)$ is:\n$$H(s) = \\frac{1/C}{s + 1/\\tau} = \\frac{1}{C} \\frac{1}{s + 1/(RC)}$$\nThe impulse response $h(t)$ is the inverse Laplace transform of $H(s)$.

Step Response, $s(t)$**\nThe step response $s(t)$ is the output $v(t)$ when the input is the unit step function, $i_{\\text{in}}(t) = u(t)$. For an LTI system, the step response is the time integral of the impulse response:\n$$s(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} h(\\lambda) \\,d\\lambda$$\nSince $h(\\lambda) = 0$ for $\\lambda  0$, for $t \\geq 0$ this becomes:\n$$s(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{1}{C} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda}{RC}\\right) \\,d\\lambda$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$s(t) = \\frac{1}{C} \\left[ -RC \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda}{RC}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{t}$$\n$$s(t) = -R \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{RC}\\right) - \\exp(0) \\right]$$\n$$s(t) = -R \\left( \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{RC}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\n$$s(t) = R \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{RC}\\right)\\right)$$\nTo express this for all time, we include the unit step function:\n$$s(t) = R \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{RC}\\right)\\right) u(t)$$\nThis is the step response for $t \\geq 0$.\n\n**3.

This exercise reveals how the sensitivity of hearing is literally encoded in the mechanical properties of the cell [@problem_id:5052930].", "problem": "A hair cell’s mechanotransduction channel is mechanically coupled to the hair bundle by a linear “gating spring” of stiffness $k_s$. The hair bundle itself is represented by a single effective linear elastic element of stiffness $k_b$ in series with the gating spring. The channel has two states, open and closed. When the channel opens, the rest length of the gating spring decreases by a small distance $d$ (the “gating swing”), while the hair bundle element’s rest length is unchanged.

It is well-posed, providing all necessary information to derive the requested quantity, $x_s$. The language is objective and the setup is internally consistent. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be formulated.\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the energy difference between the open and closed states, $\\Delta E(x) = E_O(x) - E_C(x)$, as a function of the external displacement $x$. The total energy of a state is the sum of its mechanical potential energy and an intrinsic conformational energy, $E^0$. The mechanical energy of the series-spring system is equivalent to that of a single spring with stiffness $k_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{k_s k_b}{k_s + k_b}$.\n\n**State C (Closed):**\nIn the closed state, the system is a simple series of two springs. Let the displacement $x$ be measured from the position where the system is at rest (zero force). The mechanical potential energy is $U_C(x) = \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{eq}} x^2$. The total energy is:\n$$E_C(x) = \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{eq}} x^2 + E_C^0$$\nwhere $E_C^0$ is the intrinsic energy of the closed channel protein.\n\n**State O (Open):**\nIn the open state, the gating spring's rest length shortens by $d$. This \"gating swing\" effectively shifts the mechanical energy landscape. The minimum mechanical energy for the open channel no longer occurs at $x=0$, but at a displacement that counteracts the internal tension created by the gating swing. The standard and physically consistent way to model this is to describe the mechanical potential energy of the open state as:\n$$U_O(x) = \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{eq}} (x-d)^2$$\nThis formulation correctly captures that the minimum mechanical energy for the open state now occurs at $x=d$. The total energy of the open state is therefore:\n$$E_O(x) = \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{eq}} (x-d)^2 + E_O^0$$\n\nNow, we compute the energy difference $\\Delta E(x) = E_O(x) - E_C(x)$:\n$$\\Delta E(x) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{eq}} (x-d)^2 + E_O^0\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{eq}} x^2 + E_C^0\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta E(x) = (E_O^0 - E_C^0) + \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{eq}} (x^2 - 2xd + d^2) - \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{eq}} x^2$$\nLetting $\\Delta E^0 = E_O^0 - E_C^0$, the intrinsic energy difference, we get:\n$$\\Delta E(x) = \\Delta E^0 - k_{\\mathrm{eq}} xd + \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{eq}} d^2$$\nThis expression is linear in the displacement $x$.\n\nNext, we use this energy difference in the Boltzmann relation for the open probability $P_O(x)$:\n$$P_O(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E(x)}{k_B T}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E^0 - k_{\\mathrm{eq}} xd + \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{eq}} d^2}{k_B T}\\right)}$$\nTo show this is a logistic function and identify its parameters, we rearrange the exponent:\n$$P_O(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{eq}}d}{k_B T} \\left(x - \\left(\\frac{d}{2} + \\frac{\\Delta E^0}{k_{\\mathrm{eq}}d}\\right)\\right)\\right)}$$\nThis is a classic logistic (sigmoidal) function of the form $P_O(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x-x_{1/2}}{x_s}\\right)}$.\n\nFrom this form, we can identify the half-activation displacement $x_{1/2}$ and the characteristic displacement scale $x_s$.\nThe half-activation displacement, $x_{1/2}$, is the value of $x$ where $P_O(x) = 1/2$. This occurs when the argument of the exponential is zero:\n$$x_{1/2} = \\frac{d}{2} + \\frac{\\Delta E^0}{k_{\\mathrm{eq}}d}$$\nThe characteristic displacement scale, $x_s$, determines the steepness of the activation curve. By comparing the exponents, we identify $x_s$ as:\n$$x_s = \\frac{k_B T}{k_{\\mathrm{eq}}d}$$\nThis quantity represents the displacement over which the gating energy changes by one unit of thermal energy, $k_B T$.\n\nFinally, we substitute the expression for the equivalent stiffness $k_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{k_s k_b}{k_s + k_b}$:\n$$x_s = \\frac{k_B T}{\\left(\\frac{k_s k_b}{k_s + k_b}\\right)d} = \\frac{k_B T (k_s + k_b)}{k_s k_b d}$$\nThis can be rewritten to highlight the role of compliance (inverse stiffness, $C=1/k$):\n$$x_s = \\frac{k_B T}{d} \\left(\\frac{1}{k_s} + \\frac{1}{k_b}\\right) = \\frac{k_B T}{d} (C_s + C_b)$$\nThis shows that $x_s$, the measure of the width of the activation range, is proportional to the total compliance of the mechanical system. A more compliant (softer) bundle, having a larger total compliance $C_s+C_b$, requires a larger displacement $x$ to generate the same gating force, resulting in a broader, less sensitive activation curve (larger $x_s$). Conversely, a stiffer system is more sensitive. The scale $x_s$ is also proportional to temperature $T$ and inversely proportional to the gating swing $d$.\n\nThe problem asks for the closed-form analytical expression for $x_s$ in terms of the given parameters.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{k_B T (k_s + k_b)}{k_s k_b d}}$$", "id": "5052930"}]}
