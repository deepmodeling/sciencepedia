The concept of an excitatory center defined by a sensitivity threshold is fundamental to the study of receptive fields. The problem is scientifically grounded.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem asks for a probability. The sample space (a circular area of radius $R$) and the event space (the excitatory center) are clearly defined. The probability distribution (uniform over area) is explicitly stated. The condition $R  \\sigma\\sqrt{2\\ln(1/\\eta)}$ ensures that the event space is a strict subset of the sample space, which prevents ambiguity.

It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\nThe problem asks for the probability that a point stimulus, located uniformly at random within a circular patch of skin, falls inside the excitatory center of a somatosensory receptor.\n\nFor a uniform probability distribution over a two-dimensional area, the probability $P(E)$ of an event $E$ is given by the ratio of the area of the region corresponding to the event, $\\text{Area}(E)$, to the total area of the sample space, $\\text{Area}(S)$.\n$$P(E) = \\frac{\\text{Area}(E)}{\\text{Area}(S)}$$\n\nFirst, we define the sample space $S$. The stimulus is delivered over a circular skin patch of radius $R$ centered on the receptive field center, which we take to be the origin $(0,0)$. The sample space $S$ is therefore the set of all points $(x,y)$ such that $x^2 + y^2 \\le R^2$. The area of this circular region is:\n$$\\text{Area}(S) = \\pi R^{2}$$\n\nNext, we define the event $E$, which is that the stimulus falls within the excitatory center. The excitatory center is the set of points $(x,y)$ where the sensitivity $h(x,y)$ is at least a fraction $\\eta$ of the peak sensitivity $h(0,0)$.\n\nThe sensitivity function is $h(x,y) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right)$.\nThe peak sensitivity occurs at the center $(0,0)$:\n$$h(0,0) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0^{2}+0^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) = A \\exp(0) = A$$\n\nThe condition for a point $(x,y)$ to be in the excitatory center is $h(x,y) \\ge \\eta h(0,0)$. Substituting the expressions for $h(x,y)$ and $h(0,0)$:\n$$A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) \\ge \\eta A$$\nSince $A0$, we can divide both sides by $A$ without changing the inequality:\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) \\ge \\eta$$\nThe natural logarithm function, $\\ln(\\cdot)$, is monotonically increasing, so we can apply it to both sides while preserving the inequality:\n$$\\ln\\left[\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right)\\right] \\ge \\ln(\\eta)$$\n$$-\\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}} \\ge \\ln(\\eta)$$\nTo isolate $x^{2}+y^{2}$, we multiply both sides by $-2\\sigma^{2}$. Since $-2\\sigma^{2}$ is a negative quantity, we must reverse the direction of the inequality:\n$$x^{2}+y^{2} \\le -2\\sigma^{2}\\ln(\\eta)$$\nGiven that $0  \\eta  1$, its natural logarithm $\\ln(\\eta)$ is negative. Therefore, $-2\\sigma^{2}\\ln(\\eta)$ is a positive value. We can rewrite $-\\ln(\\eta)$ as $\\ln(\\eta^{-1})$ or $\\ln(1/\\eta)$. The inequality becomes:\n$$x^{2}+y^{2} \\le 2\\sigma^{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\right)$$\nThis inequality describes a circular disk centered at the origin. Let the radius of this excitatory center be $r_E$. Then its squared radius is $r_E^2 = 2\\sigma^{2}\\ln(1/\\eta)$.\n\nThe area of the event space $E$ (the excitatory center) is therefore:\n$$\\text{Area}(E) = \\pi r_E^2 = \\pi \\left(2\\sigma^{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\right)\\right)$$\n\nThe problem statement provides the condition $R  \\sigma\\sqrt{2\\ln(1/\\eta)}$, which is equivalent to $R  r_E$. This confirms that the excitatory center is entirely contained within the circular skin patch over which the stimulus is applied. Thus, the event region is simply the excitatory center itself, and its area is as calculated above.\n\nFinally, we compute the probability as the ratio of the areas:\n$$P(E) = \\frac{\\text{Area}(E)}{\\text{Area}(S)} = \\frac{2\\pi\\sigma^{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\right)}{\\pi R^{2}}$$\nThe factor of $\\pi$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, yielding the final expression for the probability:\n$$P(E) = \\frac{2\\sigma^{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\right)}{R^{2}}$$\nThis expression gives the probability in terms of the specified parameters $\\eta$, $\\sigma$, and $R$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\right)}{R^{2}}}$$", "id": "5059480"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the simple Gaussian model, many sensory neurons exhibit a more complex center-surround antagonism, a structure critical for detecting contrast and edges.

A classical, well-tested description of center-surround receptive fields is the difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) model, in which a narrow excitatory center is opposed by a broader inhibitory surround. Let the radial sensitivity profile be denoted by $h(r)$, where $r$ is the radial distance from the receptive field center in the stimulus plane. Assume isotropy so that $h(r)$ depends only on $r$, and consider a normalized case in which the center amplitude is unity and the surround has gain $k$.\n\nStarting from the core definitions that (i) a linear receptive field sums center and surround contributions and (ii) each contribution decays radially as a Gaussian $g_{\\sigma}(r)=\\exp\\!\\big(-r^{2}/(2\\sigma^{2})\\big)$ with standard deviation $\\sigma$, derive the general expression for the radius $r_{0}$ at which the net sensitivity crosses zero, i.e., $h(r_{0})=0$, in terms of the center width $\\sigma_{c}$, the surround width $\\sigma_{s}$, and the surround gain $k$ (with equal center and surround amplitudes before weighting).

The problem states that it is formed by a narrow excitatory center opposed by a broader inhibitory surround. The center has a normalized amplitude of unity ($1$), and the surround has a relative gain of $k$. Both contributions are described by Gaussian functions of the form $g_{\\sigma}(r) = \\exp(-r^2 / (2\\sigma^2))$, where $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation, representing the width.\n\nLet $\\sigma_c$ be the width of the excitatory center Gaussian and $\\sigma_s$ be the width of the inhibitory surround Gaussian.

Also, for the center of the receptive field (at $r=0$) to be excitatory, we must have $h(0)  0$, which implies $1 - k  0$, or $k  1$.\n\nThe zero-crossing radius, denoted as $r_0$, is the radial distance at which the net sensitivity is zero, i.e., $h(r_0) = 0$. We set the expression for $h(r)$ to zero and solve for $r=r_0$:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{r_0^2}{2\\sigma_c^2}\\right) - k \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r_0^2}{2\\sigma_s^2}\\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{r_0^2}{2\\sigma_c^2}\\right) = k \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r_0^2}{2\\sigma_s^2}\\right)\n$$\nTo solve for $r_0$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\ln\\left[\\exp\\left(-\\frac{r_0^2}{2\\sigma_c^2}\\right)\\right] = \\ln\\left[k \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r_0^2}{2\\sigma_s^2}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{r_0^2}{2\\sigma_c^2} = \\ln(k) + \\ln\\left[\\exp\\left(-\\frac{r_0^2}{2\\sigma_s^2}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{r_0^2}{2\\sigma_c^2} = \\ln(k) - \\frac{r_0^2}{2\\sigma_s^2}\n$$\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate the term $r_0^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{r_0^2}{2\\sigma_s^2} - \\frac{r_0^2}{2\\sigma_c^2} = \\ln(k)\n$$\n$$\nr_0^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\sigma_s^2} - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_c^2}\\right) = \\ln(k)\n$$\n$$\nr_0^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_c^2 - \\sigma_s^2}{2\\sigma_c^2 \\sigma_s^2}\\right) = \\ln(k)\n$$\nSolving for $r_0^2$:\n$$\nr_0^2 = \\frac{2\\sigma_c^2 \\sigma_s^2 \\ln(k)}{\\sigma_c^2 - \\sigma_s^2}\n$$\nSince $\\sigma_s  \\sigma_c$, the denominator $(\\sigma_c^2 - \\sigma_s^2)$ is negative. Since $k  1$, the term $\\ln(k)$ is also negative. Thus, the expression for $r_0^2$ is positive, and a real solution for $r_0$ exists. We can rewrite the expression in a more intuitive form using $\\ln(k) = -\\ln(1/k)$ and $\\sigma_c^2 - \\sigma_s^2 = -(\\sigma_s^2 - \\sigma_c^2)$:\n$$\nr_0^2 = \\frac{2\\sigma_c^2 \\sigma_s^2 (-\\ln(1/k))}{-(\\sigma_s^2 - \\sigma_c^2)} = \\frac{2\\sigma_c^2 \\sigma_s^2 \\ln(1/k)}{\\sigma_s^2 - \\sigma_c^2}\n$$\nTaking the square root gives the general expression for the zero-crossing radius $r_0$ (we take the positive root as radius is non-negative):\n$$\nr_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma_c^2 \\sigma_s^2 \\ln(1/k)}{\\sigma_s^2 - \\sigma_c^2}}\n$$\n\nNext, we apply this general result to the specific receptive field given:\n$$\nh(r) = \\exp(-r^2/2) - 0.5 \\exp(-r^2/18)\n$$\nBy comparing this to the general form $h(r) = \\exp(-r^2/(2\\sigma_c^2)) - k \\exp(-r^2/(2\\sigma_s^2))$, we can identify the parameters:\n- From the center term, $\\exp(-r^2/2) = \\exp(-r^2/(2\\sigma_c^2))$, we have $2\\sigma_c^2 = 2$, which implies $\\sigma_c^2 = 1$ and $\\sigma_c = 1$.\n- From the surround term, $0.5 \\exp(-r^2/18) = k \\exp(-r^2/(2\\sigma_s^2))$, we have $k=0.5$ and $2\\sigma_s^2 = 18$, which implies $\\sigma_s^2 = 9$ and $\\sigma_s = 3$.\nThe problem states that $r$ is measured in millimeters, so $\\sigma_c = 1 \\, \\text{mm}$ and $\\sigma_s = 3 \\, \\text{mm}$. Now we compute $r_0$:\n$$\nr_0^2 = \\frac{2(1)^2(3)^2 \\ln(1/0.5)}{(3)^2 - (1)^2} = \\frac{2(1)(9) \\ln(2)}{9 - 1} = \\frac{18 \\ln(2)}{8} = \\frac{9 \\ln(2)}{4}\n$$\nTherefore, the zero-crossing radius is:\n$$\nr_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{9 \\ln(2)}{4}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\ln(2)}}{2}\n$$\nThe units of $r_0$ are millimeters (mm).\n\nFinally, we interpret qualitatively how $r_0$ scales with $\\sigma_c$ and $\\sigma_s$ for a fixed gain $k$. It is convenient to use the form $r_0^2 = \\frac{2 \\ln(1/k)}{1/\\sigma_c^2 - 1/\\sigma_s^2}$. Since $k$ is fixed, the numerator $2 \\ln(1/k)$ is a positive constant.\n1.  **Scaling with $\\sigma_c$ (fixed $\\sigma_s$, $k$)**: As the center width $\\sigma_c$ increases (while still satisfying $\\sigma_c  \\sigma_s$), the term $1/\\sigma_c^2$ decreases. This causes the denominator $(1/\\sigma_c^2 - 1/\\sigma_s^2)$ to decrease. A smaller positive denominator results in a larger value for the fraction $r_0^2$. Therefore, $r_0$ increases as $\\sigma_c$ increases. Qualitatively, a wider excitatory center requires one to move to a larger radius before the inhibitory surround can cancel its effect.\n2.  **Scaling with $\\sigma_s$ (fixed $\\sigma_c$, $k$)**: As the surround width $\\sigma_s$ increases, the term $1/\\sigma_s^2$ decreases. This causes the denominator $(1/\\sigma_c^2 - 1/\\sigma_s^2)$ to increase. A larger positive denominator results in a smaller value for the fraction $r_0^2$. Therefore, $r_0$ decreases as $\\sigma_s$ increases. Qualitatively, a broader surround means its influence decays more slowly with distance. This allows the surround's inhibitory effect to \"catch up\" to and cancel the more rapidly decaying excitatory center's effect at a smaller radius.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{\\ln(2)}}{2}}\n$$", "id": "5059471"}, {"introduction": "Sensory processing occurs in both space and time, and a neuron's temporal response is just as critical as its spatial tuning.
