A solution will be formulated based on the provided principles.\n\n**Solution Formulation**\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the peak postsynaptic potential in a neuron under the combined influence of synchronous excitatory inputs and shunting inhibition. The solution can be determined in two sequential steps, following the biophysical principles cited in the problem.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total peak amplitude of the postsynaptic potential resulting from the excitatory inputs alone, assuming no inhibition is present. The problem states that for small signals, synchronous EPSPs sum approximately linearly.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of afferent fibers, where $N = 10$.\nLet $V_{single}$ be the peak amplitude of the EPSP from a single fiber, where $V_{single} = 0.5$ mV.\n\nThe total excitatory postsynaptic potential, $V_{excitatory}$, is the linear summation of the individual EPSPs:\n$$V_{excitatory} = N \\times V_{single}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$V_{excitatory} = 10 \\times 0.5 \\text{ mV} = 5.0 \\text{ mV}$$\n\nSecond, we account for the effect of the shunting inhibition. The problem states that the shunting inhibitory conductance reduces the \"effective voltage gain\" by $40\\%$. In the context of Ohm's law for a neuronal membrane ($V = I_{synaptic} R_{membrane}$), the voltage gain is proportional to the membrane's input resistance, $R_{membrane}$. Shunting inhibition increases membrane conductance, which is the reciprocal of resistance, thereby decreasing $R_{membrane}$ and scaling down the voltage response ($V$) for a given synaptic current ($I_{synaptic}$).\n\nThe problem specifies that this effect scales the voltage response multiplicatively. A reduction of $40\\%$ means the new voltage gain is $100\\% - 40\\% = 60\\%$ of the original gain. Therefore, the resulting voltage response will be $60\\%$ of the response that would have occurred without inhibition.\n\nThe scaling factor, $S_{inhib}$, is:\n$$S_{inhib} = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$$\n\nThe final peak postsynaptic potential, $V_{peak}$, is the uninhibited potential, $V_{excitatory}$, multiplied by this scaling factor:\n$$V_{peak} = V_{excitatory} \\times S_{inhib}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$V_{peak} = 5.0 \\text{ mV} \\times 0.60$$\n$$V_{peak} = 3.0 \\text{ mV}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

No history of trauma.\n*   **Neurological Examination Findings:**\n    *   Vibration sense and joint position sense are markedly reduced in both lower limbs.\n    *   The sensory level for these modalities is approximately the umbilicus ($T10$) downward.\n    *   Light touch over the lower abdomen is normal.\n    *   Pinprick and temperature sensation are intact throughout.\n    *   Motor strength is $5/5$ in all muscle groups.\n    *   Tendon reflexes are normal.\n    *   Romberg sign is positive.\n    *   Cranial nerve examination is normal, with no facial sensory involvement.\n*   **Imaging:** Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is pending.\n*   **Core Principles for Derivation:**\n    *   (i) The dorsal column-medial lemniscus (DCML) pathway conveys vibration, conscious proprioception, and discriminative touch via large-diameter, heavily myelinated primary afferents that ascend ipsilaterally in the dorsal columns and decussate at the level of the caudal medulla.\n    *   (ii) The anterolateral system (ALS) conveys pain and temperature via small-diameter fibers that decussate within $1-2$ spinal segments via the anterior white commissure.\n*   **Task:** Use the provided principles and knowledge of spinal cord anatomy (segmental organization, somatotopy) to localize the single most likely site of the lesion.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is grounded in fundamental principles of clinical neurology and neuroanatomy.

The clinical scenario is realistic and provides sufficient, non-contradictory information to arrive at a logical conclusion based on the provided first principles. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe task is to localize a neurological lesion based on a specific pattern of signs and symptoms, using the provided neuroanatomical principles.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Sensory Deficits:**\n    *   The patient exhibits a marked reduction in vibration sense and joint position sense. According to principle (i), these sensory modalities are conveyed by the dorsal column–medial lemniscus (DCML) pathway.\n    *   Conversely, pinprick and temperature sensation are intact. According to principle (ii), these are conveyed by the anterolateral system (ALS).\n    *   This pattern of deficits—impaired DCML modalities with spared ALS modalities—is known as a **dissociated sensory loss**. It points to a lesion that selectively damages the DCML pathway while sparing the ALS.\n\n2.  **Analyze Motor and Reflex Findings:**\n    *   Motor strength is full ($5/5$), and tendon reflexes are normal. This indicates that the major motor pathways (e.g., corticospinal tracts) and local reflex arcs are functioning properly and are not significantly affected by the lesion.\n\n3.  **Localize the Lesion in the Neuroaxis:**\n    *   The deficits are bilateral in the lower limbs, with a sensory level at the $T10$ dermatome (umbilicus). The cranial nerve examination is normal, and there is no facial sensory loss.\n    *   A lesion in the brainstem (pons, midbrain) or thalamus/cortex would typically be unilateral (unless very large and midline) and would likely involve the face and upper limbs if it were extensive enough to affect both lower limbs. A lesion in the pons or higher would cause contralateral deficits to the body because the medial lemniscus has already decussated. The absence of facial involvement further argues against a lesion rostral to the spinal cord.\n    *   Therefore, the lesion must be located in the **spinal cord**.\n\n4.  **Localize the Lesion within the Spinal Cord's Cross-Section:**\n    *   The DCML pathway travels in the **dorsal (posterior) columns** of the spinal cord. The ALS travels in the anterolateral funiculus. The corticospinal tracts are primarily in the lateral funiculus. Since only DCML functions are impaired, the lesion must be confined to the posterior columns.\n    *   The deficits are **bilateral**. This implies that the lesion affects the posterior columns on both sides of the spinal cord, suggesting a central or midline location.\n\n5.  **Determine the Rostral-Caudal Level and Somatotopy:**\n    *   The sensory level is at $T10$. For an ascending tract lesion, this means that all sensory information from dermatomes $T10$ and below is blocked. This places the rostral-most extent of the functional lesion at the **$T10$ spinal cord segment**.\n    *   The somatotopic organization of the dorsal columns is crucial. Fibers from lower spinal levels (sacral, lumbar, lower thoracic) are located most medially, forming the **fasciculus gracilis**. Fibers from higher levels (upper thoracic, cervical) are added laterally and form the **fasciculus cuneatus** (which is primarily present from the $T6$ level upwards).\n    *   The patient's deficits are in the lower limbs and trunk up to $T10$. This corresponds precisely to the information carried by the bilateral fasciculi graciles. A midline lesion at the $T10$ level would preferentially damage these medial structures.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Final Localization:**\n    *   The clinical picture is best explained by a single lesion located in the **midline of the posterior spinal cord** at approximately the **$T10$ level**. This lesion selectively damages **both fasciculi graciles** while sparing the more laterally placed fasciculi cuneati (which are just beginning to form at this level) and the more ventrally located anterolateral and corticospinal tracts.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **A. A midline posterior cord lesion at approximately the $T10$ spinal cord level selectively involving both fasciculi graciles, sparing the anterolateral system**\n    *   This option perfectly matches the localization derived from first principles. It accounts for the bilateral DCML deficits (vibration/proprioception) below the $T10$ level by damaging the fasciculi graciles, and it explains the sparing of pain/temperature (ALS) and motor function.\n    *   **Verdict: Correct**\n\n*   **B. A unilateral right nucleus gracilis lesion in the caudal medulla**\n    *   The nucleus gracilis is the synapse point for the fasciculus gracilis. A lesion here would affect DCML modalities. However, since the primary afferents ascend ipsilaterally, a lesion of the *right* nucleus gracilis would cause deficits on the *right* side of the body (lower limb). The patient's deficits are bilateral.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **C. A left medial lemniscus lesion in the rostral pons**\n    *   The medial lemniscus is the ascending pathway after decussation in the medulla. A lesion of the *left* medial lemniscus would cause deficits on the *contralateral* (right) side of the body. Also, a lesion in the pons would likely affect the ascending fibers for the face, which are spared in this patient. The patient's deficits are bilateral.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **D. A right anterolateral (spinothalamic) tract lesion at the $T10$ spinal level**\n    *   A lesion of the anterolateral system would cause loss of pain and temperature sensation. The patient's pain and temperature sensation are intact. The primary deficit is in the DCML pathway.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **E. A bilateral fasciculus cuneatus lesion at the $C5$ spinal cord level**\n    *   The fasciculus cuneatus carries DCML information from the upper limbs and trunk (from $T6$ upwards). A lesion here would cause sensory loss in the arms, not the legs. The patient's deficits are in the lower limbs and trunk below $T10$.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4524508"}]}
