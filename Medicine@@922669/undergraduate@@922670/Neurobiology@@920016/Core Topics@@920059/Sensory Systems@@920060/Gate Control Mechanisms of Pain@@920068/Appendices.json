No flaws are identified.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\n\nThe problem requires a derivation from first principles of the gating condition for pain transmission and the minimal inhibitory drive $I_{\\mathrm{min}}$ required to prevent it.\n\nLet $V_{\\mathrm{net}}$ be the net somatic depolarization of the projection neuron relative to its resting potential. According to the problem statement, which assumes a linear integration regime, this depolarization is the difference between the excitatory millivolt-equivalent drive $E$ and the inhibitory millivolt-equivalent drive $I$. This is consistent with facts (i) and (ii), which state that inputs sum linearly and inhibition subtracts from excitation. Thus, we can write:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{net}} = E - I\n$$\nFact (iii) states that a pain signal is transmitted when the membrane depolarization exceeds the action potential threshold $\\theta$. Mathematically, this condition is:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{net}} > \\theta\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $V_{\\mathrm{net}}$, we obtain the gating condition for pain transmission:\n$$\nE - I > \\theta\n$$\nThis inequality represents the condition under which the projection neuron fires an action potential and transmits a pain signal.\n\nNext, we must derive an expression for the minimal inhibitory drive, $I_{\\mathrm{min}}$, required to *prevent* pain transmission. Preventing transmission means that the gating condition is not met. The logical negation of the inequality $E - I > \\theta$ is:\n$$\nE - I \\le \\theta\n$$\nThis is the condition that must be satisfied by the inhibitory drive $I$ to block the pain signal. We need to find the smallest value of $I$ that satisfies this condition, subject to the biophysical constraint that the inhibitory drive cannot be negative, i.e., $I \\ge 0$.\n\nLet us rearrange the inequality to solve for $I$:\n$$\nE - \\theta \\le I\n$$\nSo, to prevent the neuron from firing, the inhibitory drive $I$ must satisfy two conditions simultaneously:\n$1.$ $I \\ge E - \\theta$\n$2.$ $I \\ge 0$ (the biophysical constraint)\n\nThe minimal value of $I$, which we denote $I_{\\mathrm{min}}$, must be large enough to satisfy both of these lower bounds. Therefore, $I_{\\mathrm{min}}$ must be the maximum of the two quantities $E - \\theta$ and $0$. This can be expressed analytically using the maximum function:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\max(0, E - \\theta)\n$$\nThis expression correctly captures the two possible scenarios. If the excitatory drive $E$ is not strong enough to overcome the threshold on its own (i.e., $E \\le \\theta$), then $E - \\theta \\le 0$. In this case, no inhibition is necessary to prevent firing, and the minimal required inhibitory drive is $I_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\max(0, \\text{a non-positive number}) = 0$. If the excitatory drive is suprathreshold (i.e., $E > \\theta$), then $E - \\theta > 0$. An inhibitory drive of at least this magnitude is required to bring the net depolarization down to or below the threshold. The minimal required drive is therefore $I_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\max(0, E - \\theta) = E - \\theta$.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nFinally, we evaluate the expression for $I_{\\mathrm{min}}$ using the given values: $E = 12.5$ and $\\theta = 8.0$. The units for these values are millivolt-equivalent (mV), so the resulting $I_{\\mathrm{min}}$ will also be in these units.\n\nSubstituting the values into the derived expression:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\max(0, 12.5 - 8.0)\n$$\nFirst, we compute the difference:\n$$\n12.5 - 8.0 = 4.5\n$$\nNow we apply the maximum function:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\max(0, 4.5)\n$$\nSince $4.5 > 0$, the result is:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{min}} = 4.5\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The negative sign indicates that the direction of the current has reversed. The initially inhibitory (hyperpolarizing) GABAergic synapse becomes excitatory (depolarizing). This is a qualitative switch in function.\n$2$. The magnitude of $|R| = 1.5$ indicates that the strength of the current is now $50\\%$ greater than it was in the baseline condition, but in the opposite direction.\nTherefore, the pathological change not only abolishes the inhibition provided by the gate control circuit but actively reverses it into excitation, thereby facilitating the transmission of nociceptive signals.
