A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem describes an astigmatic eye modeled as a thin toric lens. An object at optical infinity produces a parallel beam of light incident upon this lens. In the paraxial approximation, the focal length $f$ of a thin lens is the inverse of its power $F$, i.e., $f = 1/F$.\n\nA toric lens has two different powers, $F_{v}$ and $F_{h}$, corresponding to its principal meridians. For an object at infinity, this results in two distinct focal lines instead of a single focal point.\n\n**1. Focal Line Locations and Orientations**\nRays of light entering the eye in a vertical plane (the sagittal plane for a vertical meridian) are focused by the power of the vertical meridian, $F_{v}$. These rays converge to a focus at an axial distance $f_{v} = 1/F_{v}$ from the lens. At this plane, the rays from the horizontal meridian have not yet converged, so the image formed is a horizontal line.\nSimilarly, rays entering in a horizontal plane (the tangential plane for a horizontal meridian) are focused by the power of the horizontal meridian, $F_{h}$. These rays converge to a focus at an axial distance $f_{h} = 1/F_{h}$. At this plane, the rays from the vertical meridian have already converged and are now diverging, forming a vertical line image.\nTherefore, the two focal line locations are:\n$$f_{v} = \\frac{1}{F_{v}}$$\n$$f_{h} = \\frac{1}{F_{h}}$$\nThe focal line created by the vertical meridian is oriented horizontally, and the focal line created by the horizontal meridian is oriented vertically. The orientation of each focal line is perpendicular to the corresponding principal meridian. Since $F_{v} > F_{h}$, it follows that $f_{v} < f_{h}$. The horizontal focal line is formed closer to the lens.\n\n**2. Blur Semi-axes at a General Plane $z$**\nConsider a ray entering the pupil parallel to the optical axis at a height $y$ from the axis in the vertical meridian. After passing through the thin lens, its angle $\\theta_{v}$ with respect to the optical axis is given by the lensmaker's equation for ray angle in the paraxial limit: $\\theta_{v} \\approx \\tan(\\theta_{v}) = -y/f_{v} = -y F_{v}$.\nThe height of this ray, $y(z)$, at an axial distance $z$ from the lens is $y(z) = y + z \\theta_{v} = y(1 - z F_{v})$.\nThe blur patch at plane $z$ has a semi-axis length in the vertical direction, $b_{y}(z)$, determined by the ray that passes through the edge of the pupil, where $y=r_{p}$.\n$$b_{y}(z) = |y(z)|_{y=r_{p}} = |r_{p}(1 - z F_{v})| = r_{p}|1 - z F_{v}|$$\nBy identical reasoning for the horizontal meridian with power $F_{h}$ and a ray entering at horizontal position $x=r_{p}$, the semi-axis length of the blur in the horizontal direction, $b_{x}(z)$, is:\n$$b_{x}(z) = r_{p}|1 - z F_{h}|$$\nThe blur patch at a general location $z$ between the focal lines is an ellipse with semi-axes $b_{x}(z)$ and $b_{y}(z)$.\n\n**3. Blur at the Retinal Plane $z_{R}$**\nThe problem states the retina is located at the plane of the spherical equivalent focus, $z_{R} = 1/F_{\\mathrm{SE}}$, where $F_{\\mathrm{SE}} = (F_{v} + F_{h})/2$. We substitute this location into the expressions for the semi-axes.\n\nFor the vertical semi-axis:\n$$b_{y}(z_{R}) = r_{p}\\left|1 - z_{R} F_{v}\\right| = r_{p}\\left|1 - \\frac{F_{v}}{F_{\\mathrm{SE}}}\\right| = r_{p}\\left|\\frac{F_{\\mathrm{SE}} - F_{v}}{F_{\\mathrm{SE}}}\\right|$$\nSubstituting $F_{\\mathrm{SE}} = (F_{v} + F_{h})/2$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{SE}} - F_{v} = \\frac{F_{v} + F_{h}}{2} - F_{v} = \\frac{F_{h} - F_{v}}{2}$$\nSo,\n$$b_{y}(z_{R}) = r_{p}\\left|\\frac{(F_{h} - F_{v})/2}{(F_{v} + F_{h})/2}\\right| = r_{p}\\left|\\frac{F_{h} - F_{v}}{F_{v} + F_{h}}\\right|$$\nSince $F_{v} > F_{h}$, we have:\n$$b_{y}(z_{R}) = r_{p}\\frac{F_{v} - F_{h}}{F_{v} + F_{h}}$$\n\nFor the horizontal semi-axis:\n$$b_{x}(z_{R}) = r_{p}\\left|1 - z_{R} F_{h}\\right| = r_{p}\\left|1 - \\frac{F_{h}}{F_{\\mathrm{SE}}}\\right| = r_{p}\\left|\\frac{F_{\\mathrm{SE}} - F_{h}}{F_{\\mathrm{SE}}}\\right|$$\nSubstituting $F_{\\mathrm{SE}} = (F_{v} + F_{h})/2$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{SE}} - F_{h} = \\frac{F_{v} + F_{h}}{2} - F_{h} = \\frac{F_{v} - F_{h}}{2}$$\nSo,\n$$b_{x}(z_{R}) = r_{p}\\left|\\frac{(F_{v} - F_{h})/2}{(F_{v} + F_{h})/2}\\right| = r_{p}\\frac{F_{v} - F_{h}}{F_{v} + F_{h}}$$\n\nSince $b_{x}(z_{R}) = b_{y}(z_{R})$, the blur patch at the retina is a circle. This particular location, $z = 1/F_{SE}$, is known as the location of the \"circle of least confusion\". Let the radius of this circle be $b$.\n$$b = r_{p}\\frac{F_{v} - F_{h}}{F_{v} + F_{h}}$$\n\n**4. Computation of the Retinal Blur Area**\nThe area $A$ of the circular blur patch is $A = \\pi b^2$.\n$$A = \\pi \\left( r_{p}\\frac{F_{v} - F_{h}}{F_{v} + F_{h}} \\right)^2$$\nWe substitute the given numerical values: $r_{p} = 2.0$ mm, $F_{v} = 61$ D, and $F_{h} = 59$ D.

It presents the models' assumptions neutrally for the purpose of the logical deduction.\n\nThe problem statement is found to be valid. No flaws are identified. I will now proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation\nThe goal is to determine the sign of a change in $d_e$ and $R_a$ when the eye shifts focus from distant to near, according to both the Helmholtz and Schachar models. This shift is called accommodation.\n\n**1. General Optical Requirement for Accommodation**\nFor the eye to focus from a distant object to a near object, its total optical power must increase. The problem states this requires a \"net steepening of one or both lens surfaces.\" A steeper surface has a higher curvature. For a spherical surface, an increase in curvature corresponds to a decrease in the radius of curvature. The observable $R_a$ is the central anterior lens radius of curvature. Therefore, any viable model of accommodation must predict that $R_a$ **decreases**. This is a critical first deduction. The descriptive text for both models explicitly states that they lead to a \"steepening\" of the central curvature, which is consistent with this requirement.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Helmholtz Model**\n-   **Mechanism**: Ciliary muscle contraction leads to a *reduction* in zonular fiber tension.\n-   **Lens Shape Change**: The lens is an elastic body. When the pulling force from the zonules is reduced, the lens's elastic capsule causes it to recoil towards a more naturally spherical or globular shape.\n-   **Change in $d_e$**: A more spherical shape is thicker along its axis and narrower at its equator. This is consistent with the volume conservation principle: the model description states the axial thickness $t$ increases. For the volume $V \\sim A \\cdot t$ (where $A \\propto d_e^2$) to remain constant, an increase in $t$ necessitates a decrease in $A$, which means $d_e$ must **decrease**.\n-   **Change in $R_a$**: The model explicitly states that the lens's central curvature \"steepens\". As established, this means $R_a$ must **decrease**.\n-   **Helmholtz Prediction**: $d_e$ decreases and $R_a$ decreases.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Schachar Model**\n-   **Mechanism**: Ciliary muscle contraction leads to an *increase* in tension specifically in the equatorial zonular fibers.\n-   **Lens Shape Change**: This increased tension pulls radially outwards on the lens equator. The model states this action \"expands the lens equator\".\n-   **Change in $d_e$**: An expansion of the lens equator directly implies that the equatorial diameter $d_e$ **increases**.\n-   **Change in $R_a$**: The model explicitly states that this equatorial expansion leads to a \"steepening of the central curvature\". As established, this means $R_a$ must **decrease**.\n-   **Schachar Prediction**: $d_e$ increases and $R_a$ decreases.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\nBased on the derivations:\n-   Helmholtz Model: $d_e$ decreases; $R_a$ decreases.\n-   Schachar Model: $d_e$ increases; $R_a$ decreases.\n\nI will now evaluate each option against these conclusions.\n\n**A.
