According to Kirchhoff's current law, the total current, $I(t)$, recorded by the voltage-clamp amplifier is the sum of the ionic current flowing through the resistance, $I_R(t)$, and the capacitive current, $I_C(t)$, required to change the charge on the capacitance:\n$$ I(t) = I_R(t) + I_C(t) $$\n\nFirst, we determine the membrane resistance, $R_m$, by analyzing the steady-state response of the circuit. A voltage step of amplitude $\\Delta V = 10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ is applied. The problem states that at the end of the step, i.e., at steady state ($t \\to \\infty$), the recorded current settles to a steady-state leak current, $I_{ss} = 50\\,\\mathrm{pA}$. At steady state, the membrane voltage is constant, so its time derivative is zero ($\\frac{dV_m}{dt} = 0$). Consequently, the capacitive current, which is defined as $I_C(t) = C_m \\frac{dV_m}{dt}$, must be zero. The total current is therefore equal to the resistive current. The problem states this current is ohmic. Using Ohm's law, we relate the voltage step $\\Delta V$ to the steady-state current $I_{ss}$ and the membrane resistance $R_m$:\n$$ \\Delta V = I_{ss} R_m $$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $R_m$:\n$$ R_m = \\frac{\\Delta V}{I_{ss}} $$\nWe are given $\\Delta V = 10\\,\\mathrm{mV} = 10 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and $I_{ss} = 50\\,\\mathrm{pA} = 50 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A}$.

The problem states that the recorded current's capacitive transient decays monoexponentially with a time constant $\\tau = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. It is also assumed that this observed time constant is the membrane's passive time constant. For a parallel RC circuit, this time constant is defined as the product of the resistance and the capacitance:\n$$ \\tau = R_m C_m $$\nThis relation is a fundamental property derived from the first-order linear differential equation that describes the voltage or current response of the circuit.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to find the fractional underestimation of the true sodium conductance, $g_{\\text{Na}}$. This error arises because the naive calculation uses the command potential, $V_{\\text{cmd}}$, instead of the actual membrane potential, $V_m$, which is altered by the voltage drop across the access resistance, $R_a$.\n\nThe fractional underestimation, which we will denote as $\\epsilon$, is defined as the difference between the true and the naive conductance, divided by the true conductance:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{g_{\\text{Na}} - g_{\\text{naive}}}{g_{\\text{Na}}} $$\nwhere $g_{\\text{Na}}$ is the true conductance and $g_{\\text{naive}}$ is the naively estimated conductance. This can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\epsilon = 1 - \\frac{g_{\\text{naive}}}{g_{\\text{Na}}} $$\nThe current, $I_{\\text{peak}}$, flowing through the access resistance, $R_a$, creates a voltage drop, $V_{\\text{drop}} = I_{\\text{peak}}R_a$. The actual membrane potential, $V_m$, is the command potential, $V_{\\text{cmd}}$, minus this voltage drop:\n$$ V_m = V_{\\text{cmd}} - I_{\\text{peak}}R_a $$\nThe true sodium conductance, $g_{\\text{Na}}$, is defined by Ohm's law using the actual membrane potential, $V_m$:\n$$ I_{\\text{peak}} = g_{\\text{Na}}(V_m - E_{\\text{rev,Na}}) $$\nTherefore, the true conductance is:\n$$ g_{\\text{Na}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{peak}}}{V_m - E_{\\text{rev,Na}}} $$\nThe naive conductance estimator, $g_{\\text{naive}}$, is defined using the command potential, $V_{\\text{cmd}}$:\n$$ g_{\\text{naive}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{peak}}}{V_{\\text{cmd}} - E_{\\text{rev,Na}}} $$\nNow, we can find the ratio $\\frac{g_{\\text{naive}}}{g_{\\text{Na}}}$:\n$$ \\frac{g_{\\text{naive}}}{g_{\\text{Na}}} = \\frac{\\frac{I_{\\text{peak}}}{V_{\\text{cmd}} - E_{\\text{rev,Na}}}}{\\frac{I_{\\text{peak}}}{V_m - E_{\\text{rev,Na}}}} = \\frac{V_m - E_{\\text{rev,Na}}}{V_{\\text{cmd}} - E_{\\text{rev,Na}}} $$\nSubstitute the expression for $V_m$ into the numerator:\n$$ V_m - E_{\\text{rev,Na}} = (V_{\\text{cmd}} - I_{\\text{peak}}R_a) - E_{\\text{rev,Na}} = (V_{\\text{cmd}} - E_{\\text{rev,Na}}) - I_{\\text{peak}}R_a $$\nSubstituting this back into the ratio gives:\n$$ \\frac{g_{\\text{naive}}}{g_{\\text{Na}}} = \\frac{(V_{\\text{cmd}} - E_{\\text{rev,Na}}) - I_{\\text{peak}}R_a}{V_{\\text{cmd}} - E_{\\text{rev,Na}}} = 1 - \\frac{I_{\\text{peak}}R_a}{V_{\\text{cmd}} - E_{\\text{rev,Na}}} $$\nFinally, we substitute this result into the expression for the fractional error $\\epsilon$:\n$$ \\epsilon = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{I_{\\text{peak}}R_a}{V_{\\text{cmd}} - E_{\\text{rev,Na}}}\\right) = \\frac{I_{\\text{peak}}R_a}{V_{\\text{cmd}} - E_{\\text{rev,Na}}} $$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the fractional underestimation of the conductance. The problem specifies that the error should be a positive fraction. Let's check the signs. The current $I_{\\text{peak}}$ is inward, so it has a negative sign. The driving force $(V_{\\text{cmd}} - E_{\\text{rev,Na}})$ is also negative since $V_{\\text{cmd}}  E_{\\text{rev,Na}}$. The ratio of two negative numbers will be positive, as required.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values.
