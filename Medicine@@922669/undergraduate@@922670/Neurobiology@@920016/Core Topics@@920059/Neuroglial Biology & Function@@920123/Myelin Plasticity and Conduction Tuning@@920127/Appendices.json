It provides a set of idealized but consistent biophysical assumptions from which a unique, meaningful solution can be derived. All required data and definitions are provided. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the three tasks in order.\n\n**Task 1: Compute the baseline g-ratio, $g_{1}$**\n\nThe g-ratio, $g$, is defined as the ratio of the inner axonal diameter, $d_{\\text{axon}}$, to the outer fiber diameter, $d_{\\text{fiber}}$.\n$$g = \\frac{d_{\\text{axon}}}{d_{\\text{fiber}}}$$\nUsing the provided baseline measurements from TEM imaging:\n$d_{\\text{axon}} = 2.4\\,\\mu\\text{m}$\n$d_{\\text{fiber}} = 3.6\\,\\mu\\text{m}$\n\nThe baseline g-ratio, $g_{1}$, is computed as:\n$$g_{1} = \\frac{2.4\\,\\mu\\text{m}}{3.6\\,\\mu\\text{m}} = \\frac{2.4}{3.6} = \\frac{24}{36} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\n**Task 2: Derive the scaling of conduction velocity, $v$, with g-ratio, $g$**\n\nThe conduction velocity, $v$, for saltatory conduction is the distance of one internode, $L$, divided by the time, $t$, it takes for the action potential to \"jump\" from one node of Ranvier to the next.\n$$v = \\frac{L}{t}$$\nThe problem states that this time, $t$, is the time required to charge the internodal capacitance, $C$, to a threshold voltage, $\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}$, by the nodal current, $I_{\\text{node}}$. This is given as:\n$$t = \\frac{C \\cdot \\Delta V_{\\text{th}}}{I_{\\text{node}}}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $t$ into the velocity equation gives:\n$$v = \\frac{L}{\\left(\\frac{C \\cdot \\Delta V_{\\text{th}}}{I_{\\text{node}}}\\right)} = \\frac{L \\cdot I_{\\text{node}}}{C \\cdot \\Delta V_{\\text{th}}}$$\nThe total internodal capacitance, $C$, is the capacitance per unit length, $C'$, multiplied by the internodal length, $L$: $C = C' L$. Substituting this into the velocity expression:\n$$v = \\frac{L \\cdot I_{\\text{node}}}{(C' L) \\cdot \\Delta V_{\\text{th}}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{node}}}{C' \\cdot \\Delta V_{\\text{th}}}$$\nThe problem provides the formula for the capacitance per unit length of the myelin sheath, modeled as a coaxial capacitor:\n$$C' = \\frac{2\\pi \\epsilon}{\\ln(R/r)}$$\nHere, $\\epsilon$ is the permittivity of myelin, $r$ is the inner radius ($d_{\\text{axon}}/2$), and $R$ is the outer radius ($d_{\\text{fiber}}/2$).

We can group them into a single constant of proportionality, $K$:\n$$K = \\frac{I_{\\text{node}}}{2\\pi \\epsilon \\cdot \\Delta V_{\\text{th}}}$$\nThis simplifies the velocity expression to:\n$$v = K \\cdot \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r}\\right)$$\nTo find the scaling with the g-ratio, we express the ratio of radii, $R/r$, in terms of $g$:\n$$\\frac{R}{r} = \\frac{d_{\\text{fiber}}/2}{d_{\\text{axon}}/2} = \\frac{d_{\\text{fiber}}}{d_{\\text{axon}}}$$\nSince $g = d_{\\text{axon}}/d_{\\text{fiber}}$, the ratio of radii is the reciprocal of the g-ratio:\n$$\\frac{R}{r} = \\frac{1}{g}$$\nSubstituting this into the velocity equation yields the final scaling relationship:\n$$v = K \\cdot \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{g}\\right)$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$, we have:\n$$v = -K \\cdot \\ln(g)$$\nThus, the conduction velocity $v$ scales in proportion to $-\\ln(g)$. Since $g$ for a myelinated axon is always less than $1$, $\\ln(g)$ is negative, and the velocity $v$ is positive, as expected.\n\n**Task 3: Compute the multiplicative change in conduction velocity, $v_{2}/v_{1}$**\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio of the new velocity, $v_{2}$, to the baseline velocity, $v_{1}$, following a myelin plasticity event. The g-ratio changes from the baseline value $g_{1}$ to a new value $g_{2} = 0.75$.\nThe baseline velocity is:\n$$v_{1} = -K \\cdot \\ln(g_{1})$$\nThe new velocity is:\n$$v_{2} = -K \\cdot \\ln(g_{2})$$\nThe multiplicative change is the ratio $v_{2}/v_{1}$:\n$$\\frac{v_{2}}{v_{1}} = \\frac{-K \\cdot \\ln(g_{2})}{-K \\cdot \\ln(g_{1})} = \\frac{\\ln(g_{2})}{\\ln(g_{1})}$$\nFrom Task 1, the baseline g-ratio is $g_{1} = 2/3$. The problem states the new g-ratio is $g_{2} = 0.75 = 3/4$.\nSubstituting these values into the ratio expression:\n$$\\frac{v_{2}}{v_{1}} = \\frac{\\ln(3/4)}{\\ln(2/3)}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\\ln(3/4) = \\ln(0.75) \\approx -0.28768207$$\n$$\\ln(2/3) \\approx \\ln(0.6666...) \\approx -0.40546511$$\n$$\\frac{v_{2}}{v_{1}} \\approx \\frac{-0.28768207}{-0.40546511} \\approx 0.7095033$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\frac{v_{2}}{v_{1}} \\approx 0.7095$$\nThis result indicates that increasing the g-ratio from $2/3$ to $3/4$ (i.e., thinning the myelin sheath while keeping the axon diameter constant) leads to a decrease in conduction velocity to about $71\\%$ of its original value, according to this model.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.7095}\n$$", "id": "5035188"}, {"introduction": "While we know that structural changes can increase conduction speed, the nervous system must also operate within tight constraints on space and energy.

The scenario of fever impacting conduction is clinically relevant (e.g., Uhthoff's phenomenon in multiple sclerosis). The specified parameters, such as g-ratio, dimensions, and $Q_{10}$ values, are within physiologically and experimentally realistic ranges. The problem is free of pseudoscience.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides sufficient data and principles to make a reasoned, semi-quantitative prediction.

There are no internal contradictions.\n- **Realism:** The scenario is physically and biologically plausible.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in quantitative neurobiology. I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine how the safety factor ($\\mathrm{SF}$) for action potential propagation changes when the temperature increases from $T_0 = 37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to $T_f = 40^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. The temperature change is $\\Delta T = T_f - T_0 = 3^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. The scaling factor for any parameter with a given $Q_{10}$ is $(Q_{10})^{\\Delta T/10} = (Q_{10})^{3/10} = (Q_{10})^{0.3}$.\n\nThe safety factor is defined as $\\mathrm{SF} = \\frac{\\text{Current/Charge Supplied}}{\\text{Current/Charge Demanded}}$. Let's analyze the effect of temperature on the numerator and the denominator.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Numerator (Current/Charge Supplied):**\nThe current supplied to the next node is determined by the sodium current ($I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$) generated at the active node, which then propagates down the internode.\n- **Peak NaV Conductance ($g_{\\mathrm{Na}}$):** The peak conductance of NaV channels increases with temperature. The scaling factor is $(Q_{10}^{\\mathrm{Na}})^{0.3} = (2.0)^{0.3} \\approx 1.231$. This represents an approximate $23\\%$ increase in peak conductance, which tends to **increase** the source current.\n- **NaV Inactivation Kinetics:** The rate of NaV channel inactivation accelerates significantly with temperature. The rate constant for inactivation ($1/\\tau_h$) scales by $(Q_{10}^{\\mathrm{h}})^{0.3} = (3.0)^{0.3} \\approx 1.390$. This means the channels inactivate about $39\\%$ faster. A shorter channel open time reduces the total duration of the sodium current pulse, thereby decreasing the total charge injected ($Q_{\\mathrm{Na}} = \\int I_{\\mathrm{Na}}(t)dt$). This effect tends to **decrease** the charge supplied. The large $Q_{10}$ for inactivation is a major factor that often outweighs the increase in conductance, leading to a net reduction in the total depolarizing charge.\n- **Internodal Current Loss:** The current generated at one node is attenuated as it travels to the next. The problem states that the net internodal shunt conductance increases with temperature, with $Q_{10}^{\\mathrm{int}}=1.3$. The scaling factor for this shunt is $(1.3)^{0.3} \\approx 1.081$. This $8\\%$ increase in shunt conductance means more current leaks out through the internode (i.e., the internodal membrane resistance $r_m$ decreases). According to cable theory, this reduces the length constant $\\lambda$ and increases the exponential decay of the signal, delivering less current to the next node. This **decreases** the supplied current.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Denominator (Current/Charge Demanded):**\nThe current demanded at the next node is the minimum current required to depolarize its membrane to the action potential threshold. This current must overcome local leak and capacitive currents.\n- **Passive Leak Conductance ($g_{\\mathrm{leak}}$):** The nodal leak conductance increases with temperature, with $Q_{10}^{\\mathrm{leak}}=1.5$. The scaling factor is $(1.5)^{0.3} \\approx 1.131$. This $13\\%$ increase in leak means more current is shunted away at the node, so a larger total current is required to achieve the same level of depolarization. This **increases** the current demand.\n\n**3. Synthesis and Prediction of SF Change:**\nWe have four competing effects:\n- Increase in peak $g_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ (+23%): Increases SF.\n- Faster NaV inactivation (rate +39%): Decreases SF.\n- Increased internodal shunt (+8%): Decreases SF.\n- Increased nodal leak (+13%): Decreases SF.\n\nThree of the four effects act to decrease the safety factor. The acceleration of NaV inactivation ($Q_{10}=3.0$) is particularly potent and is known to be a primary reason for temperature-sensitive conduction failure. When combined with increased internodal and nodal leakage, it is almost certain that the net effect will be a significant **decrease** in the safety factor.\n\nA rough estimate can be made. Assuming the factors are multiplicative:\n$\\mathrm{SF}_{\\text{new}} / \\mathrm{SF}_{\\text{old}} \\approx \\frac{\\text{Source Change}}{\\text{Loss Change}} \\approx \\frac{(1.231 / 1.390)}{1.081 \\times 1.131} \\approx \\frac{0.8856}{1.222} \\approx 0.725$.\nThis back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests a decrease of about $27.5\\%$. A prediction of an \"approximately $20\\%$\" decrease is therefore highly plausible.\n\n**4. Evaluation of Compensatory Adjustments:**\n\n- **A. Prediction: SF increases...; Adjustment: lengthen internodes...**\n    - The prediction is **Incorrect**. SF decreases.\n    - The adjustment is counter-productive. Lengthening internodes ($x$ in $\\exp(-x/\\lambda)$) increases the distance over which current must be passively conducted, exacerbating signal decay and further *decreasing* SF. **Incorrect.**\n\n- **B. Prediction: SF decreases by approximately 20%...; Adjustment: reduce the g-ratio from 0.80 to 0.75...**\n    - The prediction is **Correct**. It aligns with our analysis that SF decreases significantly due to inactivation and leak mechanisms outweighing the conductance increase.\n    - The adjustment is highly effective. Reducing the g-ratio means increasing the thickness of the myelin sheath relative to the axon's diameter. Thicker myelin (more wraps) increases the internodal membrane resistance ($r_m$) and decreases its capacitance ($c_m$). Both effects reduce the internodal shunt, improving the efficiency of current transfer between nodes. This directly addresses the problem's stated vulnerability of a \"thinly myelinated\" fiber, where internodal shunt is dominant and is further worsened by fever. This is a powerful structural adaptation to enhance conduction reliability. **Correct.**\n\n- **C. Prediction: SF is unchanged...; Adjustment: increase juxtaparanodal potassium channel density...**\n    - The prediction is **Incorrect**. The competing effects do not cancel out; SF decreases.\n    - The adjustment is likely counter-productive. Increased K+ channel activity in the paranodal/juxtaparanodal regions would tend to stabilize the resting potential or hasten repolarization, which could clamp the membrane potential near rest, making it *harder* for the axon to depolarize to threshold. This would decrease, not increase, SF. **Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Prediction: SF decreases slightly (about -5%)...; Adjustment: widen the periaxonal space...**\n    - The prediction likely underestimates the magnitude of the decrease. A $5\\%$ drop is small, whereas the biophysics ($Q_{10}=3.0$ for inactivation) suggests a more substantial impact.\n    - The adjustment is counter-productive. The periaxonal space is a primary pathway for the internodal shunt current. Widening this space would *decrease* its electrical resistance, allowing *more* current to leak out, thus worsening the shunt and further decreasing SF. **Incorrect.**\n\n- **E. Prediction: SF decreases by approximately 20%...; Adjustment: upregulate nodal NaV density by 15%...**\n    - The prediction is **Correct**, matching our analysis.\n    - The adjustment is plausible. Upregulating nodal NaV density directly increases the source current ($I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$), which boosts the numerator of the SF. This is a valid mechanism for increasing SF. However, the problem asks for the *most effective* adjustment for a *thinly myelinated* fiber where *internodal shunt* is the key issue. The adjustment in option B directly targets and remedies this fundamental insulation flaw, whereas this option merely increases the \"push\" of current into a still-leaky cable. While helpful, it can be argued that improving insulation (Option B) is a more effective and efficient strategy than simply increasing the source current (Option E). Given the problem specifics, option B appears to be the superior and more targeted solution.\n\n**Conclusion:** Option B provides both a correct prediction of the SF change and the most effective and physiologically relevant adjustment to counter the specific vulnerability (poor insulation) described for the thinly myelinated fiber under the given conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5035147"}]}
