The definition of molar concentration, $c$, is the number of moles, $n$, per unit volume, $V$:\n$$c = \\frac{n}{V}$$\nFrom this definition, we can express the number of moles, $n$, in terms of concentration and volume:\n$$n = cV$$\n\n2. The number of molecules, $N$, is related to the number of moles, $n$, by Avogadro's number, $N_{A}$:\n$$N = n N_{A}$$\n\n3.

The PSD is modeled as a slab with area $A$ and thickness $t$. The volume, $V$, of such a slab is given by:\n$$V = At$$\n\n5. Finally, we substitute this geometric relation for the volume $V$ into our expression for $N$:\n$$N = c(At)N_{A}$$\nThis is the required symbolic expression for the number of CaMKII holoenzymes, $N$, in the PSD.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nTo evaluate $N$, we must use a consistent set of units for all parameters. We will convert all quantities to SI base units (meters, moles).\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- $A = 0.085 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n- $t = 38 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$\n- $c = 130 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $N_{A} = 6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we convert the area $A$ from square micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$) to square meters ($\\mathrm{m}^2$).

Since $1 \\ \\mathrm{nm} = 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}$:\n$$t = 38 \\ \\mathrm{nm} = 38 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n\nNow, we convert the concentration $c$ from micromolar ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) to moles per cubic meter ($\\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$). The molar unit is moles per liter ($\\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{L}^{-1}$). First, $1 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} = 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{M} = 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.
