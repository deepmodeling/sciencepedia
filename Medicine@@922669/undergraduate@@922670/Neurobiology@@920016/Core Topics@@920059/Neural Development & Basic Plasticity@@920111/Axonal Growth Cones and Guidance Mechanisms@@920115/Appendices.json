The peripheral domain of the growth cone contains a lamellipodium composed of filamentous actin (F-actin), into which dynamic microtubule plus-ends occasionally advance. Consider the following well-tested facts and core definitions relevant to cytoskeletal dynamics and guidance signaling:\n\n- Microtubule plus-ends polymerize by addition of guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-tubulin, with an effective polymerization velocity $v_p$ that depends on the local availability of tubulin heterodimers and the kinetic balance of addition and loss, which can be schematized as $v_p \\propto k_{\\mathrm{on}}[T] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, where $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ are effective rate constants and $[T]$ is the local concentration of polymerization-competent tubulin subunits.\n- Microtubules exhibit dynamic instability characterized by stochastic switching between growth and shrinkage, with catastrophe frequency $f_c$ increasing when plus-ends are destabilized by reduced GTP cap stability, mechanical load, or decreased stabilizing factors.\n- Collapsin Response Mediator Protein 2 (CRMP2) binds tubulin heterodimers and promotes their delivery to microtubule plus-ends, thereby increasing effective $[T]$ near the plus-end and supporting advance into the lamellipodium. Phosphorylation of CRMP2 by kinases reduces its affinity for tubulin and its ability to promote microtubule assembly.\n- Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) is a classic repulsive guidance cue that signals via Neuropilin/Plexin receptors to activate RhoA/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5)/Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta (GSK3$\\beta$) pathways, which increase CRMP2 phosphorylation and enhance actomyosin contractility, respectively.\n- Entry of microtubules into the lamellipodium requires that $v_p$ exceed the local retrograde flow velocity $v_r$ of the F-actin network and that $f_c$ remain low enough for sustained advance.\n\nAn experiment applies Sema3A locally to only the left margin of an otherwise symmetric growth cone using a micropipette. Within the exposed region, CRMP2 phosphorylation increases and is spatially restricted to the left lamellipodium. Assume that phosphorylation of CRMP2 reduces its effective tubulin-delivery function such that the local $[T]$ at microtubule plus-ends is scaled by a factor $\\alpha$, with $0<\\alpha<1$, and that signaling concurrently elevates actomyosin contractility, increasing the local $v_r$ and $f_c$ on the exposed side.

On the Sema3A-exposed side, $v_p$ decreases and $f_c$ increases because CRMP2 phosphorylation lowers effective $[T]$ at plus-ends and contractility raises mechanical load; microtubule invasion into the lamellipodium is reduced, lamellipodial F-actin retracts ipsilaterally, and the growth cone collapses asymmetrically, biasing turning away from the Sema3A source.\n\nB. Phosphorylated CRMP2 binds tubulin more strongly, increasing $[T]$ and hence $v_p$ on the exposed side; microtubule invasion and lamellipodial protrusion increase there, causing an attractive turn toward the Sema3A source without collapse.\n\nC. Local Sema3A affects only actin; microtubule dynamics ($v_p$ and $f_c$) remain unchanged. The lamellipodium collapses symmetrically due to global membrane tension, and the growth cone neither turns nor retracts preferentially.\n\nD. Microtubules initially overshoot into the exposed lamellipodium because $f_c$ transiently decreases, producing a brief expansion on the Sema3A side; only later does CRMP2 phosphorylation restore baseline dynamics, leading to symmetric collapse without directional bias.", "solution": "We start from the stated foundational principles of microtubule dynamic instability and cytoskeletal control of growth cone behavior.\n\nMicrotubule plus-end advance into the lamellipodium depends on the balance between polymerization and opposing forces. The effective polymerization velocity can be represented as $v_p \\propto k_{\\mathrm{on}}[T] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, where $[T]$ captures local availability of polymerization-competent tubulin near the plus-end. CRMP2, in its non-phosphorylated state, binds tubulin heterodimers and facilitates their delivery to microtubule plus-ends, effectively increasing $[T]$. Phosphorylation of CRMP2 diminishes this function, reducing $[T]$, thereby lowering $v_p$. Additionally, the probability of catastrophe per unit time, $f_c$, increases when stabilizing factors are lost and when mechanical load and contractile forces rise at the leading edge.\n\nSemaphorin 3A signaling via Neuropilin/Plexin activates CDK5 and GSK3$\\beta$, which phosphorylate CRMP2; phosphorylated CRMP2 has reduced tubulin-binding affinity. Concurrently, Sema3A activates RhoA/ROCK to elevate actomyosin contractility, which increases the retrograde flow velocity $v_r$ and compressive load on microtubule plus-ends. For microtubule invasion into the lamellipodium to occur, we require $v_p > v_r$ and sufficiently low $f_c$ to avoid frequent shrinkage events. Local Sema3A on the left side imposes spatially restricted changes: CRMP2 phosphorylation scales the effective tubulin delivery by a factor $\\alpha$, with $0<\\alpha<1$, decreasing $[T]$ and thus $v_p$ on that side, while ROCK-mediated contractility raises $v_r$ and increases $f_c$.\n\nIntegrating these effects:\n\n- Decreased $[T]$ at plus-ends due to CRMP2 phosphorylation yields a reduced $v_p$ ($v_p \\downarrow$).\n- Increased actomyosin contractility raises $v_r$ ($v_r \\uparrow$) and mechanical load, increasing $f_c$ ($f_c \\uparrow$).\n- Because $v_p$ drops and $v_r$ rises on the exposed side, the condition $v_p > v_r$ fails locally; microtubule plus-ends are less able to invade the lamellipodium, and those that do invade are more likely to undergo catastrophe.\n- The lamellipodium on the exposed side undergoes F-actin depolymerization and retraction driven by the same signaling, producing an ipsilateral collapse.\n- The non-exposed side retains higher $v_p$ (due to intact CRMP2 function) and lower $v_r$ and $f_c$, so protrusive activity persists comparatively, biasing the growth cone to turn away from the Sema3A source. If the signal intensity is high, the overall growth cone may collapse, but the onset is asymmetric, beginning on the exposed side within the observed $1$–$2$ minutes.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This option states that on the exposed side, $v_p$ decreases and $f_c$ increases because CRMP2 phosphorylation lowers effective $[T]$ and actomyosin contractility increases load. It predicts reduced microtubule invasion into the lamellipodium, ipsilateral lamellipodial retraction, and asymmetric collapse leading to turning away. This perfectly matches the mechanistic derivation from the principles: $v_p \\downarrow$ via reduced $[T]$, $v_r \\uparrow$ via contractility, $f_c \\uparrow$ via destabilization and load, resulting in diminished advance and ipsilateral collapse. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. This option asserts that phosphorylated CRMP2 binds tubulin more strongly, increasing $[T]$ and $v_p$ and producing attraction toward Sema3A. This contradicts the established role of CRMP2 phosphorylation, which reduces tubulin binding and microtubule assembly support. It also contradicts the repulsive nature of Sema3A signaling in axons. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. This option claims microtubule dynamics remain unchanged and that collapse is symmetric due to global membrane tension. The foundational facts explicitly state that CRMP2 phosphorylation affects microtubule assembly support ($v_p$) and that RhoA/ROCK affects $f_c$ and $v_r$. Local application leads to spatially restricted effects and thus asymmetry, not symmetry. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. This option suggests an initial decrease in $f_c$ leading to overshoot and expansion, followed by restoration to baseline and symmetric collapse. Sema3A signaling does not decrease $f_c$; it destabilizes microtubules via reduced CRMP2-mediated tubulin delivery and increased contractile load, increasing $f_c$. The symmetry claim conflicts with the local nature of the signal. Verdict: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5000040"}]}
