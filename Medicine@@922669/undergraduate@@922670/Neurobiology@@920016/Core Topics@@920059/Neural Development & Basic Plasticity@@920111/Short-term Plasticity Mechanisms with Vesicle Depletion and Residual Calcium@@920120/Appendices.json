Consider the quantal hypothesis of synaptic transmission and the binomial model, in which a population of release-ready vesicles at an active zone can release neurotransmitter with independent probability $p$ per vesicle per action potential, and each released vesicle contributes a fixed quantal postsynaptic current amplitude $q$ that sums linearly. Residual calcium following a conditioning stimulus increases the release probability $p$ on the subsequent test stimulus by binding to the calcium sensor for exocytosis, while vesicle depletion reduces the number of available vesicles.\n\nAt a single active zone with $N=3$ release-ready vesicles and no postsynaptic receptor saturation or desensitization, the following measurements are obtained from $1000$ trials at two calcium conditions:\n- Baseline condition: measured failure rate $F_1 = 0.512$ and unconditional mean excitatory postsynaptic current amplitude across all trials $\\mu_1 = 5.9 \\,\\mathrm{pA}$.\n- Elevated residual calcium condition: measured failure rate $F_2 = 0.274$ and unconditional mean excitatory postsynaptic current amplitude across all trials $\\mu_2 = 11.2 \\,\\mathrm{pA}$.\nAn independent estimate of the quantal size from spontaneous miniature events yields $q \\approx 9.5 \\,\\mathrm{pA}$.\n\nTwo mechanistic hypotheses are considered for this single active zone:\n- Single-vesicle release (SVR): at most one vesicle can release per action potential at the active zone, even if multiple vesicles are present.\n- Multivesicular release (MVR): more than one vesicle can release per action potential at the active zone, up to the number of release-ready vesicles, with linear summation of quanta.\n\nWhich option best explains how multivesicular release at a single active zone alters the binomial quantal model and proposes a principled way to distinguish SVR from MVR using failure rates and amplitude distributions in this preparation?\n\nA. The dataset is consistent with single-vesicle release, because the mean amplitude increases in proportion to the reduction in failures. To distinguish SVR from MVR, rely on failure rate measurements alone: multivesicular release does not change the relationship between failure rate and release probability, so failures are sufficient to decide.\n\nB. The dataset supports multivesicular release, because the mean amplitude increases more than expected if only a single vesicle could contribute; under residual calcium, multiple vesicles can release and their quanta sum. To distinguish SVR from MVR, compare how the unconditional mean amplitude scales with failure rate across calcium manipulations and inspect the amplitude distribution of successful trials: multivesicular release produces a rightward shift with multimodal peaks near integer multiples of the quantal size, whereas single-vesicle release retains a unimodal success distribution near the quantal size with changes dominated by failure probability.\n\nC. The dataset is inconclusive, because single-vesicle and multivesicular release produce identical dependencies of mean amplitude on failure rate. To distinguish mechanisms, use the paired-pulse ratio alone; amplitude distributions are non-diagnostic in this context.\n\nD. The dataset supports multivesicular release, because failure rate is independent of calcium whereas amplitude depends on calcium.

The parameters (`N`, `q`, `F`, `\\mu`) are within physiologically plausible ranges for a central synapse. The distinction between SVR and MVR is a topic of active research and a key concept in synaptic physiology. The problem is well-posed, asking for a conceptual analysis and interpretation of data based on two competing models. There are no apparent contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific principles in the problem statement itself. The provided data are sufficient to perform a quantitative comparison of the two models. A preliminary check shows that the data can be used to meaningfully discriminate between the hypotheses.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nWe will formalize the two models (MVR and SVR) and test their predictions against the provided experimental data.\n\n**1. Multivesicular Release (MVR) Model**\nThe MVR model is described by the binomial distribution. The probability `P(k)` of releasing `k` vesicles out of `N` available, each with release probability `p`, is:\n$$ P(k) = \\binom{N}{k} p^k (1-p)^{N-k} $$\n- **Failure Rate (`F`):** The probability of releasing zero vesicles (`k=0`).\n  $$ F = P(0) = \\binom{N}{0} p^0 (1-p)^{N-0} = (1-p)^N $$\n  This allows us to calculate `p` from `F` and `N`: `p = 1 - F^{1/N}`.\n- **Unconditional Mean Amplitude (`\\mu`):** The expected value of the amplitude across all trials (including failures). It is the mean number of released vesicles, `E[k]`, multiplied by the quantal size `q`. For a binomial distribution, `E[k] = Np`.\n  $$ \\mu_{\\text{MVR}} = E[k] \\cdot q = Npq $$\n\n**2. Single-Vesicle Release (SVR) Model**\nIn the SVR model, at most one vesicle can be released per action potential. An event is either a failure (amplitude `0`) or a success (amplitude `q`).\n- **Failure Rate (`F`):** The probability of failure is the same as in the MVR model: it is the probability that none of the `N` vesicles are released.\n  $$ F_{\\text{SVR}} = (1-p)^N $$\n- **Success Rate (`P_{\\text{success}}`):** The probability of success is the probability that at least one vesicle is released, which is `1 - F_{\\text{SVR}}`.\n  $$ P_{\\text{success}} = 1 - (1-p)^N = 1 - F_{\\text{SVR}} $$\n- **Unconditional Mean Amplitude (`\\mu`):** This is the probability of a success multiplied by the success amplitude `q`, plus the probability of a failure multiplied by the failure amplitude `0`.\n  $$ \\mu_{\\text{SVR}} = P_{\\text{success}} \\cdot q + F_{\\text{SVR}} \\cdot 0 = (1 - F_{\\text{SVR}})q $$\nThis establishes a direct, linear relationship between the mean amplitude and the success probability `(1-F)`.\n\n**3. Testing the Models with Experimental Data**\nGiven: `N=3` and `q = 9.5 \\,\\mathrm{pA}`.\n\n**Condition 1 (Baseline): `F_1 = 0.512`, measured `\\mu_1 = 5.9 \\,\\mathrm{pA}`.**\n- **MVR Prediction:**\n    - First, find `p_1`: `p_1 = 1 - F_1^{1/N} = 1 - (0.512)^{1/3} = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2`.\n    - Then, predict `\\mu_{1,\\text{MVR}}`: `\\mu_{1,\\text{MVR}} = Np_1q = 3 \\times 0.2 \\times 9.5 \\,\\mathrm{pA} = 5.7 \\,\\mathrm{pA}`.\n    - This prediction (`5.7 \\,\\mathrm{pA}`) is very close to the measured value (`5.9 \\,\\mathrm{pA}`).\n- **SVR Prediction:**\n    - Predict `\\mu_{1,\\text{SVR}}`: `\\mu_{1,\\text{SVR}} = (1 - F_1)q = (1 - 0.512) \\times 9.5 \\,\\mathrm{pA} = 0.488 \\times 9.5 \\,\\mathrm{pA} = 4.636 \\,\\mathrm{pA}`.\n    - This prediction (`4.636 \\,\\mathrm{pA}`) is a poor fit to the measured value (`5.9 \\,\\mathrm{pA}`).\n\n**Condition 2 (Elevated Calcium): `F_2 = 0.274`, measured `\\mu_2 = 11.2 \\,\\mathrm{pA}`.**\n- **MVR Prediction:**\n    - First, find `p_2`: `p_2 = 1 - F_2^{1/N} = 1 - (0.274)^{1/3} \\approx 1 - 0.6495 = 0.3505`.\n    - Then, predict `\\mu_{2,\\text{MVR}}`: `\\mu_{2,\\text{MVR}} = Np_2q = 3 \\times 0.3505 \\times 9.5 \\,\\mathrm{pA} \\approx 9.99 \\,\\mathrm{pA}`.\n    - While not a perfect match to `11.2 \\,\\mathrm{pA}`, this is reasonably close and far better than the SVR prediction. The discrepancy might arise from slight variability in `q` or other biological complexities not captured by the simple binomial model, but the trend and magnitude are well-approximated.\n- **SVR Prediction:**\n    - Predict `\\mu_{2,\\text{SVR}}`: `\\mu_{2,\\text{SVR}} = (1 - F_2)q = (1 - 0.274) \\times 9.5 \\,\\mathrm{pA} = 0.726 \\times 9.5 \\,\\mathrm{pA} = 6.897 \\,\\mathrm{pA}`.\n    - This prediction (`6.897 \\,\\mathrm{pA}`) is extremely far from the measured value (`11.2 \\,\\mathrm{pA}`).\n\nThe data clearly favor the MVR model. The key observation is that the mean amplitude `\\mu` increases more strongly than the success probability `(1-F)`.\n- Increase in success probability: `(1-F_2)/(1-F_1) = (1-0.274)/(1-0.512) = 0.726/0.488 \\approx 1.49`.\n- Increase in mean amplitude: `\\mu_2/\\mu_1 = 11.2/5.9 \\approx 1.90`.\nUnder SVR, these two ratios must be equal. Under MVR, the increase in `p` not only reduces failures but also increases the average number of vesicles released per success, causing `\\mu` to grow faster than `(1-F)`.\n\n**4. Distinguishing SVR from MVR**\nBased on the analysis, two primary methods emerge:\n1.  **Scaling of Mean Amplitude with Failure Rate:** Plot `\\mu` versus `(1-F)` across conditions with varying `p`. For SVR, the data should fall on a straight line `\\mu = q(1-F)`. For MVR, the data should fall on a concave-down curve `\\mu = Nq(1-F^{1/N})` that lies above the SVR line. The provided data points clearly follow the MVR pattern.\n2.  **Amplitude Distribution of Evoked Responses:** SVR predicts that all successful responses will have an amplitude near `q`. The amplitude histogram of successes is unimodal. MVR predicts that responses can have amplitudes near `q`, `2q`, `3q`, etc. The amplitude histogram is multimodal, with peaks at integer multiples of `q`. As `p` increases, the higher-multiple peaks (`2q`, `3q`) become more probable, causing the mean of the success distribution to shift to higher values.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The dataset is consistent with single-vesicle release, because the mean amplitude increases in proportion to the reduction in failures. To distinguish SVR from MVR, rely on failure rate measurements alone: multivesicular release does not change the relationship between failure rate and release probability, so failures are sufficient to decide.**\n**Incorrect.** The first statement is false; the analysis above shows the dataset is inconsistent with SVR because the mean amplitude does *not* increase in proportion to the reduction in failures. The second statement is also false; failure rate `F = (1-p)^N` has the same functional form in both models, making it insufficient on its own to distinguish them.\n\n**B. The dataset supports multivesicular release, because the mean amplitude increases more than expected if only a single vesicle could contribute; under residual calcium, multiple vesicles can release and their quanta sum. To distinguish SVR from MVR, compare how the unconditional mean amplitude scales with failure rate across calcium manipulations and inspect the amplitude distribution of successful trials: multivesicular release produces a rightward shift with multimodal peaks near integer multiples of the quantal size, whereas single-vesicle release retains a unimodal success distribution near the quantal size with changes dominated by failure probability.**\n**Correct.** This option correctly concludes that the data support MVR and for the right reason: the disproportionate increase in mean amplitude. It then accurately describes the two key distinguishing principles: the non-linear scaling of mean amplitude with failure rate, and the presence of a multimodal amplitude distribution for successes that shifts as release probability changes.\n\n**C. The dataset is inconclusive, because single-vesicle and multivesicular release produce identical dependencies of mean amplitude on failure rate. To distinguish mechanisms, use the paired-pulse ratio alone; amplitude distributions are non-diagnostic in this context.**\n**Incorrect.** The central premise that the dependencies of `\\mu` on `F` are identical is false; they are linear for SVR and non-linear for MVR. This difference is the basis for discrimination. The claim that amplitude distributions are non-diagnostic is also fundamentally incorrect; they are one of the most powerful tools for this purpose.\n\n**D. The dataset supports multivesicular release, because failure rate is independent of calcium whereas amplitude depends on calcium. To distinguish SVR from MVR, measure changes in miniature event frequency; multivesicular release increases miniature frequency even without action potentials.**\n**Incorrect.** The premise \"failure rate is independent of calcium\" is directly contradicted by the data (`F_1=0.512` vs. `F_2=0.274`). Additionally, while miniature event frequency can be modulated by calcium, it is not the primary way to distinguish between SVR and MVR for action potential-evoked release.\n\n**E. The dataset supports single-vesicle release, because variability in postsynaptic receptor occupancy can create apparent amplitude multimodality. To distinguish SVR from MVR, use only the variance-to-mean ratio across trials; amplitude histograms are unreliable and failure rate does not inform the mechanism.**\n**Incorrect.** The dataset does not support SVR. While receptor variability exists, the claim that it makes amplitude histograms unreliable is an overstatement and ignores their central role in quantal analysis. The directive to *only* use the variance-to-mean ratio and to disregard failure rate and histograms is poor scientific advice. Failure rate, when combined with mean amplitude, is highly informative, as demonstrated in our analysis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5060249"}]}
