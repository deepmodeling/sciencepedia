Since the reversal potential is given as $V_{rev}=0\\ \\mathrm{mV}$, the driving force is simply $V$.\n\nLet's define the macroscopic conductances of the two populations. We can express these in terms of a reference conductance. Let the total conductance attributed to the CI-AMPAR population be $G_{CI}$. Based on assumption (iii), the total conductance of the CP-AMPAR population at negative potentials (when unblocked) is $G_{CP,unblocked} = \\kappa G_{CI} \\frac{f}{1-f}$. A more direct approach is to define the conductances based on the fraction of each receptor type and a characteristic single-channel conductance.\n\nLet $G_{0}$ be a reference conductance related to the total number of receptors. The conductance of the CI-AMPAR population, which constitutes a fraction ($1-f$) of the total, is proportional to this fraction. So, we can write $G_{CI} = C(1-f)$, where $C$ is a proportionality constant.\nThe CP-AMPARs constitute a fraction $f$ and have a $\\kappa$ times larger intrinsic conductance at negative potentials. Thus, their unblocked conductance is $G_{CP,unblocked} = C \\cdot f \\cdot \\kappa$. The constant $C$ encapsulates the total number of channels and the unitary conductance of a CI-AMPAR.\n\nNow, we can write the expressions for the total current at the specified test potentials.\n\nAt $V = -40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$:\nThe driving force is $-40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$. At this negative potential, the polyamine block on CP-AMPARs is relieved (assumption ii). Thus, both populations contribute with their full characteristic conductances for this potential range.\nThe total conductance is $G_{total}(-40\\ \\mathrm{mV}) = G_{CI} + G_{CP,unblocked} = C(1-f) + C f \\kappa = C(1-f+f\\kappa)$.\nThe current is:\n$$I(-40\\ \\mathrm{mV}) = G_{total}(-40\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\cdot (-40\\ \\mathrm{mV}) = C(1-f+f\\kappa) \\cdot (-40\\ \\mathrm{mV})$$\n\nAt $V = +40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$:\nThe driving force is $+40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$. At this positive potential, the CI-AMPARs behave linearly, so their conductance remains $G_{CI} = C(1-f)$. The CP-AMPARs, however, are blocked, and their effective conductance is reduced by the factor $b$.\nThe conductance of the CP-AMPAR population is $G_{CP,blocked} = b \\cdot G_{CP,unblocked} = b \\cdot (C f \\kappa)$.\nThe total conductance is $G_{total}(+40\\ \\mathrm{mV}) = G_{CI} + G_{CP,blocked} = C(1-f) + C b f \\kappa = C(1-f+bf\\kappa)$.\nThe current is:\n$$I(+40\\ \\mathrm{mV}) = G_{total}(+40\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\cdot (+40\\ \\mathrm{mV}) = C(1-f+bf\\kappa) \\cdot (+40\\ \\mathrm{mV})$$\n\nNext, we use the definition of the rectification index, $RI$:\n$$RI = \\frac{|I(+40\\ \\mathrm{mV})|}{|I(-40\\ \\mathrm{mV})|}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the currents:\n$$RI = \\frac{|C(1-f+bf\\kappa) \\cdot (40\\ \\mathrm{mV})|}{|C(1-f+f\\kappa) \\cdot (-40\\ \\mathrm{mV})|}$$\nSince all terms within the parentheses for conductance are positive ($f \\in [0,1]$, $\\kappa>0$, $b>0$), and the constant $C$ is positive, the absolute value operation applies to the negative voltage.\n$$RI = \\frac{C(1-f+bf\\kappa) \\cdot (40\\ \\mathrm{mV})}{C(1-f+f\\kappa) \\cdot (40\\ \\mathrm{mV})}$$\nThe proportionality constant $C$ and the voltage magnitude $40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ cancel out, yielding the desired expression relating the parameters:\n$$RI = \\frac{1-f+bf\\kappa}{1-f+f\\kappa}$$\n\nNow, we must solve this equation for $f$.\n$$RI \\cdot (1-f+f\\kappa) = 1-f+bf\\kappa$$\n$$RI - f \\cdot RI + f \\cdot RI\\kappa = 1 - f + f b \\kappa$$\nTo isolate $f$, we group all terms containing $f$ on one side of the equation:\n$$f - f \\cdot RI + f \\cdot RI\\kappa - f b \\kappa = 1 - RI$$\nFactor out $f$:\n$$f(1 - RI + RI\\kappa - b\\kappa) = 1 - RI$$\nThis gives the analytical expression for $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{1 - RI}{1 - RI + \\kappa(RI - b)}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $f$ using the provided data: $RI=0.62$, $b=0.25$, and $\\kappa=1.4$.\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{1 - 0.62}{1 - 0.62 + 1.4 \\cdot (0.62 - 0.25)}$$\nFirst, evaluate the terms in the numerator and denominator:\nNumerator:\n$$1 - 0.62 = 0.38$$\nDenominator:\n$$1 - 0.62 + 1.4 \\cdot (0.37) = 0.38 + 0.518 = 0.898$$\nNow, compute the fraction:\n$$f = \\frac{0.38}{0.898} \\approx 0.42316258...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$f \\approx 0.423$$\nThis value represents that approximately $42.3\\%$ of the AMPA receptors in the neuron are of the calcium-permeable, GluA2-lacking subtype.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.423}$$", "id": "5067823"}]}
