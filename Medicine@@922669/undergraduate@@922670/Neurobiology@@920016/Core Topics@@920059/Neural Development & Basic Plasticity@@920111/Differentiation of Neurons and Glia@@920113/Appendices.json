These cells are responsible for generating all the neurons and glial cells of the future brain and spinal cord. Early in development, NPCs primarily undergo symmetric proliferative divisions to expand their own population. Later, they switch to asymmetric divisions, producing one NPC (to maintain the progenitor pool) and one cell destined to become a neuron.\n\nImagine a hypothetical scenario caused by a mutation where all NPCs in the neural tube are forced to permanently exit the cell cycle immediately after completing their very first mitotic division. The two daughter cells produced by this single division are viable but can never divide again.\n\nWhich of the following would be the most direct and severe consequence of this mutation on the development of the central nervous system?\n\nA. A severe reduction in the number of neurons and glial cells, leading to a drastically smaller central nervous system.\n\nB. A normal-sized brain composed almost entirely of glial cells instead of neurons.\n\nC. A massive overgrowth of the neural tube due to uncontrolled cell division.\n\nD. The neural tube would fail to close, resulting in a neural tube defect like spina bifida.\n\nE. The progenitor cells would all undergo programmed cell death before they have a chance to divide.", "solution": "Normal developmental principle: Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) initially undergo multiple rounds of symmetric proliferative divisions to expand the progenitor pool, and later switch to asymmetric divisions to generate differentiated neurons and, later still, glia while maintaining the progenitor population.\n\nLet the initial number of NPCs be $N_{0}$. In normal development, after $m$ rounds of symmetric proliferative divisions, the progenitor pool scales as\n$$\nN_{\\text{NPC, normal}}(m)=N_{0} 2^{m}.\n$$\nSubsequent asymmetric and differentiative divisions over time yield a final number of neurons and glia that is much larger than $N_{0}$ and depends on the cumulative proliferation history; critically, it requires many cycles of division to produce the enormous cellularity of the CNS.\n\nMutation effect stated in the problem: All NPCs are forced to exit the cell cycle immediately after completing their first mitotic division. Thus each initial NPC divides once to yield two post-mitotic daughters that cannot divide again. Therefore, the total possible number of lineage-output cells is bounded by\n$$\nN_{\\text{total, mutant}} \\leq 2 N_{0},\n$$\nwith no further amplification thereafter. Compared to the normal case, where many rounds of proliferation produce $N_{0} 2^{m}$ progenitors (and subsequently far more differentiated neurons and glia), the mutant yields a severe, orders-of-magnitude reduction in total cell number.\n\nDirect developmental consequence: Because both neurogenesis and gliogenesis depend on sustained progenitor proliferation and later asymmetric divisions, forcing permanent cell-cycle exit after a single division ablates the expansion phase and the ongoing production phase. This produces drastically fewer neurons and glia and therefore a drastically smaller CNS.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A matches the predicted severe global hypoplasia of neurons and glia, yielding a drastically smaller CNS.\n- B is incompatible with the loss of proliferative capacity; the brain would not be normal-sized, nor would gliogenesis dominate without progenitor expansion.\n- C contradicts forced cell-cycle exit; there is no uncontrolled proliferation.\n- D neural tube closure defects arise earlier during neurulation and are not the most direct consequence of halting post-neurulation NPC proliferation; the central and severe outcome for CNS development is reduced cell number, not primarily failure of closure.\n- E contradicts the premise that NPCs complete one mitosis and yield viable daughters; apoptosis before division is not described.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and severe consequence is a severe reduction in neurons and glia, leading to a drastically smaller CNS.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2345419"}, {"introduction": "Once the progenitor pool has expanded, individual cells face a critical decision: differentiate into a neuron or remain a progenitor, perhaps to later become a glial cell. This process is tightly regulated by cell-to-cell communication. This practice problem [@problem_id:1705419] challenges you to predict the outcome of disrupting the Notch signaling pathway, a classic mechanism of lateral inhibition that is fundamental to achieving a balanced mixture of neurons and progenitors.", "problem": "In a developmental biology experiment, ectodermal tissue is isolated from the animal cap of an early amphibian embryo. This tissue is cultured in a medium that blocks Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling, causing the tissue to form a sheet of neural progenitor cells (NPCs). These NPCs are multipotent cells capable of differentiating into the primary cell types of the central nervous system: neurons and glial cells.\n\nUnder standard control conditions (Condition A), these NPCs are allowed to differentiate over several days. It is observed that they differentiate to produce a stable, mixed population consisting of neurons and glial cells in a ratio of 3 neurons for every 1 glial cell.\n\nIn a parallel experiment (Condition B), an identical culture of NPCs is prepared. However, at the onset of differentiation, a highly specific and potent gamma-secretase inhibitor is added to the culture medium. Gamma-secretase is an intramembrane protease complex known to be essential for the signal-releasing cleavage of a key transmembrane receptor that mediates cell-fate decisions through cell-cell contact.\n\nAssume the inhibitor is 100% effective in blocking gamma-secretase activity and has no other off-target effects on cell viability or proliferation. Based on your understanding of neurogenesis, predict the most likely composition of the differentiated cell culture in Condition B.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the expected outcome?\n\nA. The ratio of neurons to glial cells will be approximately 3:1, identical to the control condition.\n\nB. The culture will consist almost exclusively of glial cells, causing the neuron-to-glia ratio to approach zero.\n\nC. The culture will consist almost exclusively of neurons, causing the neuron-to-glia ratio to become very large.\n\nD. The cells will be arrested in their progenitor state and will fail to differentiate into either neurons or glia.\n\nE. The culture will show a massive increase in apoptosis, leading to widespread cell death and a greatly reduced cell count.", "solution": "The key receptor implied by “a signal-releasing cleavage of a key transmembrane receptor that mediates cell-fate decisions through cell-cell contact” is Notch. In canonical Notch signaling, ligand (Delta/Jagged) binding triggers two proteolytic cleavages of Notch; the intramembrane cleavage is executed by gamma-secretase and releases the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). NICD translocates to the nucleus, binds CSL/RBPJ, and activates target genes such as Hes family repressors, which inhibit proneural bHLH factors (e.g., Ascl1, Neurogenin). The relevant developmental principles are:\n- Active Notch signaling maintains neural progenitors by repressing neuronal differentiation (lateral inhibition) and, at later stages, promotes gliogenesis.\n- Blocking gamma-secretase prevents NICD release, thereby silencing Notch target gene activation.\n\nUnder control conditions, Notch-mediated lateral inhibition yields a balanced outcome with a stable mixed population of neurons and glia, here observed as approximately $3:1$ (neurons:glia). If gamma-secretase is fully inhibited at the onset of differentiation, Notch signaling is effectively off in all cells:\n1. Loss of NICD prevents Hes activation, releasing repression on proneural bHLH factors.\n2. Proneural programs drive neuronal differentiation broadly rather than being restricted by lateral inhibition.\n3. Maintenance of the progenitor pool is impaired, and the gliogenic program, which depends in part on Notch signaling, is reduced.\n\nGiven the assumption of no off-target effects on viability or proliferation, we do not expect widespread apoptosis (excluding option E) or failure to differentiate (excluding option D). Blocking Notch does not increase glial fate; it reduces it (excluding option B). The outcome should therefore be a culture composed almost entirely of neurons, making the neuron-to-glia ratio much larger than $3:1$ (excluding option A). The best description is that the culture will consist almost exclusively of neurons.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1705419"}, {"introduction": "Cellular differentiation is not only a matter of 'what' but also 'where'.
