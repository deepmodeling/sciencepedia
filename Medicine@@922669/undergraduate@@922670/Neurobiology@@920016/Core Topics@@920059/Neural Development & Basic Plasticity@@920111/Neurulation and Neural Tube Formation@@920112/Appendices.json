A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the wedge index and its subsequent calculation.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the definition of the wedge index, denoted by $W$. The problem states it is the \"fractional reduction in apical length relative to basal length.\" Let $L_a$ be the apical length and $L_b$ be the basal length. The reduction in apical length relative to the basal length is given by the difference $L_b - L_a$. The fractional reduction is this difference normalized by the reference length, which is the basal length $L_b$. Therefore, the mathematical expression for the wedge index is:\n$$W = \\frac{L_b - L_a}{L_b}$$\nThis expression can be rewritten as:\n$$W = 1 - \\frac{L_a}{L_b}$$\n\nNext, we must express $W$ in terms of the apical area, $A_a$, and the basal area, $A_b$. The problem provides the geometric relationship for the prismatic cell element: the area $A$ is related to the length $L$ and the constant thickness $h$ by $A = L \\times h$.\nFrom this relationship, we can express the lengths in terms of the areas:\n-   Apical length: $L_a = \\frac{A_a}{h}$\n-   Basal length: $L_b = \\frac{A_b}{h}$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions for $L_a$ and $L_b$ into the equation for the wedge index $W$:\n$$W = 1 - \\frac{L_a}{L_b} = 1 - \\frac{\\left(\\frac{A_a}{h}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{A_b}{h}\\right)}$$\nSince the epithelial thickness $h$ is constant and non-zero, it cancels from the numerator and denominator of the fraction:\n$$W = 1 - \\frac{A_a}{A_b}$$\nThis is the desired expression for the wedge index solely in terms of the apical and basal areas. This can also be written in the equivalent form:\n$$W = \\frac{A_b - A_a}{A_b}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of the wedge index for the post-constriction state using the given values:\n-   Post-constriction apical area: $A_{a} = 25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n-   Basal area: $A_{b} = 60\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$W = 1 - \\frac{25}{60}$$\nTo simplify the fraction $\\frac{25}{60}$, we find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator. Both $25$ and $60$ are divisible by $5$.\n$$W = 1 - \\frac{5 \\times 5}{12 \\times 5} = 1 - \\frac{5}{12}$$\nExpressing $1$ as $\\frac{12}{12}$ to perform the subtraction:\n$$W = \\frac{12}{12} - \\frac{5}{12} = \\frac{12 - 5}{12} = \\frac{7}{12}$$\nThe wedge index for the cell in its post-constriction state is $\\frac{7}{12}$.
