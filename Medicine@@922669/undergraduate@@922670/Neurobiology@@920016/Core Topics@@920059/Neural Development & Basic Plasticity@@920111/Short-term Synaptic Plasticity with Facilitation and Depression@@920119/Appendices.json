[@problem_id:5060917]", "problem": "Short-term synaptic plasticity arises from two biophysical processes that transiently modify synaptic efficacy in response to closely spaced presynaptic action potentials: facilitation and vesicle depletion (depression). Consider a single synapse in which the postsynaptic response amplitude to the $n$-th presynaptic spike, denoted $A_{n}$, is proportional to the product of two state variables evaluated at the time of that spike: the instantaneous release probability $u_{n}$ and the fraction of readily releasable vesicles $x_{n}$. The quantal amplitude $q$ is assumed constant, so $A_{n} = q\\,u_{n}\\,x_{n}$. Between spikes, facilitation decays and vesicle availability recovers exponentially to their resting values according to well-tested biophysical observations. At each spike, the release probability $u$ increases due to residual calcium, while the vesicle fraction $x$ is transiently reduced in proportion to the fraction released. Specifically, assume the following:\n- Between spikes, $u(t)$ and $x(t)$ obey first-order exponential dynamics with time constants $\\tau_{f}$ (facilitation decay) and $\\tau_{d}$ (depression recovery), respectively: $\\frac{du}{dt} = -\\frac{u}{\\tau_{f}}$ and $\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{1 - x}{\\tau_{d}}$.\n- At a presynaptic spike at time $t_{k}$, the release probability undergoes a jump determined by a utilization parameter $U$ that quantifies the increment due to facilitation: $u(t_{k}^{+}) = u(t_{k}^{-}) + U\\big(1 - u(t_{k}^{-})\\big)$.\n- The instantaneous vesicle fraction after the spike is reduced by the amount released, using the updated release probability: $x(t_{k}^{+}) = x(t_{k}^{-})\\big(1 - u(t_{k}^{+})\\big)$.\n- The amplitude elicited by the spike at $t_{k}$ is $A_{k} = q\\,u(t_{k}^{+})\\,x(t_{k}^{-})$.\n\nAssume the synapse is at rest before the first spike: $u(0^{-}) = 0$ and $x(0^{-}) = 1$.

Short-term synaptic plasticity can arise from presynaptic mechanisms such as changes in vesicle release probability between pulses, but it can also be mimicked by postsynaptic receptor desensitization that reduces receptor availability for the second pulse.

The term $ r_{n} $ is the fraction of available postsynaptic receptors at the time of pulse $n$. For the first pulse, which occurs at $ t=0 $, the synapse is assumed to be in a resting state. Therefore, all receptors are available, and the fraction of available receptors is $ r_{1} = 1 $.\n\nFor the second pulse, occurring at an inter-pulse interval of $ \\Delta t $, the fraction of available receptors is $ r_{2} = r(\\Delta t) $. We must find an expression for $ r(t) $. The problem states that the fraction of available receptors is $ r(t) = 1 - D(t) $, where $ D(t) $ is the fraction of desensitized receptors.
