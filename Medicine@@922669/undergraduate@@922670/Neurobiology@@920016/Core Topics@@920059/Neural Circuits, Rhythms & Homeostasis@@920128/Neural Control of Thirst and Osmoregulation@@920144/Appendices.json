It describes osmosis, the function of a specialized neuron (osmoreceptor), and its role in systemic water balance (AVP release and thirst). The specified concentrations and physiological temperature are realistic. The use of mannitol as an osmotic agent and the concept of the reflection coefficient are standard in physiology.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides a clear initial condition (osmotic equilibrium), a specific perturbation (addition of a known concentration of an osmoticum), and asks for the immediate, predictable consequences. The required information to determine the direction of osmotic shifts and the qualitative physiological response is present. A unique qualitative solution can be derived.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and objective language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no contradictions or missing information critical to deriving a qualitative solution. Therefore, the problem is **valid**, and a solution can be derived.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis rests on the principle of osmosis, which dictates that water moves across a semipermeable membrane down its water potential gradient, or equivalently, from a region of lower total effective solute concentration (osmolality) to a region of higher osmolality.\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The problem states that the neuron is initially in osmotic equilibrium with the extracellular fluid. This means the chemical potential of water is equal on both sides of the membrane. Consequently, the effective osmolality inside the cell, $\\Pi_{in}$, is equal to the effective osmolality of the extracellular fluid, $\\Pi_{out, initial}$.\n    $$\n    \\Pi_{in, initial} = \\Pi_{out, initial}\n    $$\n    Under this condition, there is no net flux of water across the cell membrane. The concentrations $[\\mathrm{Na}^+]_{\\mathrm{out}} = 150\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ and $[\\mathrm{Na}^+]_{\\mathrm{in}} = 15\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ are part of the set of solutes contributing to this initial equilibrium, which is actively maintained by the $\\mathrm{Na}/\\mathrm{K}$ ATPase.\n\n2.  **Perturbation**: Mannitol is added to the extracellular solution to a final concentration of $100\\,\\mathrm{mM}$. The problem specifies that mannitol is a nonpenetrating solute with a reflection coefficient, $\\sigma_{mannitol}$, of approximately $1$. The reflection coefficient quantifies the effectiveness of a solute in exerting an osmotic force across a membrane. A value of $\\sigma = 1$ indicates the solute is impermeable and thus maximally effective osmotically.\n\n3.  **New Osmotic Gradient**: The addition of mannitol increases the osmolality of the extracellular fluid. The new extracellular osmolality, $\\Pi_{out, final}$, is the sum of the initial osmolality and the contribution from mannitol.\n    $$\n    \\Pi_{out, final} = \\Pi_{out, initial} + \\sigma_{mannitol} \\times [\\text{Mannitol}]\n    $$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$\n    \\Pi_{out, final} = \\Pi_{out, initial} + (1) \\times (100\\,\\mathrm{mM}) = \\Pi_{out, initial} + 100\\,\\mathrm{mOsm/L}\n    $$\n    Immediately after the addition of mannitol, the intracellular osmolality remains $\\Pi_{in, initial}$. Since we established that $\\Pi_{in, initial} = \\Pi_{out, initial}$, it follows that:\n    $$\n    \\Pi_{out, final} > \\Pi_{in, initial}\n    $$\n    The extracellular fluid is now hypertonic with respect to the intracellular fluid. This creates a chemical potential gradient for water, with the water potential inside the cell now being higher (less negative) than outside.\n\n4.  **Water Flux and Volume Change**: Water will move via osmosis from the region of higher water potential (intracellular space) to the region of lower water potential (extracellular space). The presence of \"abundant aquaporin water channels\" ensures this flux is rapid. The net movement of water out of the cell is termed efflux. This loss of intracellular water will cause the cell volume to decrease; the neuron will **shrink**.\n\n5.  **Osmoreceptor Response**: Hypothalamic osmoreceptor neurons are functionally mechanoreceptors. Their firing rate is modulated by changes in their cell volume. Neuronal shrinkage, caused by hypertonicity, is the physiological stimulus that leads to depolarization and an **increase** in the rate of action potential firing. This is believed to be mediated by the opening of mechanosensitive cation channels in the shrunken cell.\n\n6.  **Systemic Physiological Consequences**: The increased firing of hypothalamic osmoreceptors provides the afferent signal for two critical homeostatic responses aimed at correcting the hyperosmotic state:\n    *   **Arginine Vasopressin (AVP) Release**: The axons of these osmoreceptors project to the posterior pituitary, where an increased firing rate stimulates the release of AVP (also known as antidiuretic hormone, ADH) into the bloodstream. AVP increases water reabsorption in the kidneys.\n    *   **Thirst**: The neuronal signals are also relayed to higher brain centers (e.g., cingulate cortex, insula), generating the conscious sensation of **thirst**, which motivates water intake.\n    \n    Therefore, the chain of events is: hypertonicity $\\rightarrow$ water efflux $\\rightarrow$ cell shrinkage $\\rightarrow$ increased osmoreceptor firing $\\rightarrow$ increased AVP release and increased thirst.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Net water flux is from intracellular to extracellular space, the neuron shrinks, and osmoreceptor firing increases, promoting arginine vasopressin (AVP) release and increasing thirst.**\nThis option correctly identifies that the hypertonic extracellular environment causes water efflux (intracellular to extracellular flux), leading to cell shrinkage. It correctly links this cellular event to the known physiological response of osmoreceptors: increased firing rate, which in turn promotes AVP release and stimulates thirst. This sequence is entirely consistent with our derivation from first principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Net water flux is from extracellular to intracellular space, the neuron swells, and osmoreceptor firing decreases, suppressing arginine vasopressin (AVP) release and reducing thirst.**\nThis option describes the response to a hypotonic, not hypertonic, stimulus. Water would flow into the cell, causing it to swell, only if the extracellular osmolality were lower than the intracellular osmolality. Every step in this option is the direct opposite of the correct physiological response to the given perturbation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. There is no net water flux because the Na/K ATPase maintains ionic gradients, so cell volume remains unchanged and there is no change in arginine vasopressin (AVP) release or thirst.**\nThis option misinterprets the function of the $\\mathrm{Na}/\\mathrm{K}$ ATPase. While the pump is crucial for maintaining the steady-state ionic gradients and baseline cell volume, it cannot prevent water movement in response to a large, acutely imposed osmotic gradient from a nonpenetrating solute like mannitol. The osmotic force from $100\\,\\mathrm{mOsm/L}$ of mannitol far outweighs the pump's ability to maintain volume equilibrium under this new condition. Thus, there will be a significant net water flux.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Initial water efflux is immediately counterbalanced by rapid mannitol entry through aquaporins, resulting in net swelling and decreased thirst.**\nThis option contradicts a key premise of the problem. It claims \"rapid mannitol entry,\" but the problem states mannitol is a \"nonpenetrating\" solute with a \"reflection coefficient...of approximately $1$\". A reflection coefficient of $1$ signifies impermeability. Mannitol is too large to pass rapidly through aquaporin channels. Because mannitol does not enter the cell, it cannot counterbalance the water efflux; in fact, its inability to enter is precisely why it causes water efflux. The resulting volume change is shrinkage, not swelling.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5038362"}, {"introduction": "The brain's commands to conserve or excrete water are carried out by the kidneys, acting under the influence of arginine vasopressin (AVP).

It presents a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective question in renal physiology and neurobiology with all necessary data for a unique solution.\n\nThe task is to derive the expression for electrolyte-free water clearance, $C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^e$, and compute its value. The derivation must begin from the fundamental definition of renal clearance.\n\nThe clearance of any substance $X$ from the plasma, denoted $C_X$, is defined as the virtual volume of plasma that is completely cleared of that substance per unit time. It is calculated by the formula:\n$$ C_X = \\frac{U_X \\cdot V}{P_X} $$\nwhere $U_X$ is the concentration of substance $X$ in the urine, $P_X$ is its concentration in the plasma, and $V$ is the urine flow rate.\n\nThis principle can be extended to total osmoles to define osmolar clearance, $C_{\\text{osm}}$. This represents the volume of plasma cleared of all solutes per unit time. To excrete the urinary solutes at a concentration isotonic to plasma ($P_{\\text{osm}}$), the required volume of urine would be $C_{\\text{osm}}$:\n$$ C_{\\text{osm}} = \\frac{U_{\\text{osm}} \\cdot V}{P_{\\text{osm}}} $$\nwhere $U_{\\text{osm}}$ and $P_{\\text{osm}}$ are the total osmolality of urine and plasma, respectively.\n\nStandard free water clearance, $C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$, is the difference between the actual urine flow rate, $V$, and this hypothetical isotonic urine volume, $C_{\\text{osm}}$. It quantifies the rate at which the kidney excretes solute-free water.\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = V - C_{\\text{osm}} $$\n\nThe problem asks for *electrolyte-free water clearance*, $C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^e$. This concept is a clinical modification of free water clearance that focuses on the major electrolytes, sodium ($Na^+$) and potassium ($K^+$), which are the primary determinants of extracellular fluid tonicity. The plasma tonicity is principally determined by the plasma sodium concentration, $P_{\\mathrm{Na}}$. Therefore, we use $P_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ as the reference plasma concentration instead of total plasma osmolality.\n\nThe total rate of electrolyte excretion in the urine is the sum of sodium and potassium excretion rates. This is given by $(U_{\\mathrm{Na}} + U_{\\mathrm{K}}) \\cdot V$.\n\nNext, we define the electrolyte clearance, $C_{\\text{elyt}}$, as the volume of plasma (with its tonicity represented by $P_{\\mathrm{Na}}$) that would be required to excrete these urinary electrolytes isotonically. Following the clearance principle:\n$$ C_{\\text{elyt}} \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{Na}} = (U_{\\mathrm{Na}} + U_{\\mathrm{K}}) \\cdot V $$\nSolving for $C_{\\text{elyt}}$ gives:\n$$ C_{\\text{elyt}} = \\frac{(U_{\\mathrm{Na}} + U_{\\mathrm{K}}) \\cdot V}{P_{\\mathrm{Na}}} $$\n\nElectrolyte-free water clearance, $C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^e$, is the difference between the total urine flow rate, $V$, and this electrolyte clearance volume, $C_{\\text{elyt}}$. It represents the rate of excretion of water relative to the major electrolytes.\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^e = V - C_{\\text{elyt}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{\\text{elyt}}$ yields the desired formula:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^e = V - \\frac{(U_{\\mathrm{Na}} + U_{\\mathrm{K}}) \\cdot V}{P_{\\mathrm{Na}}} $$\nFactoring out $V$, we obtain the final derived expression:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^e = V \\left( 1 - \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{Na}} + U_{\\mathrm{K}}}{P_{\\mathrm{Na}}} \\right) $$\nThis expression is dimensionally consistent, as the ratio of concentrations is dimensionless.\n\nNow, we compute the value using the provided data:\n- Urine flow rate, $V = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}}$\n- Urine sodium concentration, $U_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 80\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}}$\n- Urine potassium concentration, $U_{\\mathrm{K}} = 60\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}}$\n- Plasma sodium concentration, $P_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 120\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^e = (1.2\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}}) \\left( 1 - \\frac{80\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}} + 60\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}}}{120\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}}} \\right) $$\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^e = (1.2\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}}) \\left( 1 - \\frac{140}{120} \\right) $$\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^e = (1.2\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}}) \\left( 1 - \\frac{7}{6} \\right) $$\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^e = (1.2\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}}) \\left( -\\frac{1}{6} \\right) $$\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^e = -0.2\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}} $$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, the value is $-0.200\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}}$.\n\nQualitatively, the sign of $C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^e$ provides critical insight into renal water handling and its neural control by AVP.\n- A positive $C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^e$ indicates that the kidneys are excreting free water, producing urine that is dilute relative to plasma electrolytes (i.e., $U_{\\mathrm{Na}} + U_{\\mathrm{K}} < P_{\\mathrm{Na}}$). This is the expected response to hyponatremia, as it would help raise the plasma sodium concentration. A positive value implies AVP levels are appropriately suppressed.\n- A negative $C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^e$ indicates that the kidneys are reabsorbing free water, producing urine that is concentrated relative to plasma electrolytes (i.e., $U_{\\mathrm{Na}} + U_{\\mathrm{K}} > P_{\\mathrm{Na}}$).

This is an inappropriate physiological response to hyponatremia. It implies that AVP secretion is not suppressed as it should be; instead, it is pathologically active.
