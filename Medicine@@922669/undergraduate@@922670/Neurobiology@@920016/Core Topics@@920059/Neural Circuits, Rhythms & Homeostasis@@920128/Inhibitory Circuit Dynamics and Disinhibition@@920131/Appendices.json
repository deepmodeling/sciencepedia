The concept of shunting inhibition is a fundamental principle of synaptic integration in neurobiology. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed.

The second part requires a conceptual interpretation based on explicitly stated principles, which is a standard qualitative analysis in this field.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated using precise, objective, and standard scientific terminology, free of any subjective or opinion-based claims.\n- **Other Flaws:** The problem does not exhibit any other flaws such as incompleteness, contradiction, infeasibility, or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n- **Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n- **Action:** Proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Part 1: Computation of Inhibitory Synaptic Current**\n\nThe ionic current flowing through a set of channels is described by the conductance-based model, which is a form of Ohm's law applied to cell membranes. The current ($I$) is the product of the conductance ($g$) and the driving force, which is the difference between the membrane potential ($V$) and the reversal potential ($E_{\\text{rev}}$) for the ion(s) passing through the channel.\n\nFor the $\\text{GABA}_{\\text{A}}$ receptor-mediated current, this relationship is:\n$$I_{\\text{GABA}} = g_{\\text{GABA}} (V - E_{\\text{GABA}})$$\nThe givens are:\n- $g_{\\text{GABA}} = 10\\,\\text{nS} = 10 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{S}$\n- $V = -60\\,\\text{mV} = -60 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{V}$\n- $E_{\\text{GABA}} = -70\\,\\text{mV} = -70 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{V}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the driving force:\n$$V - E_{\\text{GABA}} = (-60 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{V}) - (-70 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{V}) = 10 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{V} = 10\\,\\text{mV}$$\nA positive driving force indicates that, by convention (referring to the flow of positive charge), the current will be outward. Since the $\\text{GABA}_{\\text{A}}$ receptor channel is permeable to negatively charged chloride ions ($\\text{Cl}^{-}$), a positive driving force for outward current corresponds to an inward flow of $\\text{Cl}^{-}$.\n\nNext, we compute the current by substituting the values into the equation:\n$$I_{\\text{GABA}} = (10 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{S}) \\times (10 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{V})$$\n$$I_{\\text{GABA}} = 100 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{A}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in picoamperes (pA), where $1\\,\\text{pA} = 10^{-12}\\,\\text{A}$.\n$$I_{\\text{GABA}} = 100\\,\\text{pA}$$\nThis positive value represents an outward current, which tends to hyperpolarize the neuron or clamp it near $E_{\\text{GABA}}$.\n\n**Part 2: Interpretation of Shunting Inhibition**\n\nShunting inhibition is a mechanism by which an inhibitory synapse reduces the effect of an excitatory input without necessarily causing a large hyperpolarization of the membrane potential. This effect is primarily mediated by a decrease in the neuron's input resistance.\n\nThe total input conductance of the neuron, $G_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of all active conductances. In this scenario, we consider the leak conductance $G_{\\text{leak}}$ and the synaptic conductance $g_{\\text{GABA}}$ to be in parallel.\n\n1.  **Input Resistance without GABAergic input:**\n    In the absence of the GABAergic synapse being active, the total conductance is just the leak conductance:\n    $$G_{\\text{total, no GABA}} = G_{\\text{leak}} = 20\\,\\text{nS}$$\n    The corresponding input resistance is:\n    $$R_{\\text{in, no GABA}} = \\frac{1}{G_{\\text{total, no GABA}}} = \\frac{1}{20 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{S}} = 50 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\Omega = 50\\,\\text{M}\\Omega$$\n\n2.  **Input Resistance with GABAergic input:**\n    When the $\\text{GABA}_{\\text{A}}$ channels open, their conductance $g_{\\text{GABA}}$ adds to the total conductance:\n    $$G_{\\text{total, with GABA}} = G_{\\text{leak}} + g_{\\text{GABA}} = 20\\,\\text{nS} + 10\\,\\text{nS} = 30\\,\\text{nS}$$\n    The new input resistance is:\n    $$R_{\\text{in, with GABA}} = \\frac{1}{G_{\\text{total, with GABA}}} = \\frac{1}{30 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{S}} \\approx 33.3 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\Omega = 33.3\\,\\text{M}\\Omega$$\n\nThe opening of the $\\text{GABA}_{\\text{A}}$ conductance increases the total membrane conductance from $20\\,\\text{nS}$ to $30\\,\\text{nS}$, thereby decreasing the input resistance from $50\\,\\text{M}\\Omega$ to $33.3\\,\\text{M}\\Omega$. This is the \"shunt.\"\n\n3.  **Effect on EPSP Amplitude:**\n    An excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) is a voltage change, $\\Delta V_{\\text{EPSP}}$, generated by an excitatory current, $I_{\\text{exc}}$. For small and brief currents, the relationship is approximated by Ohm's law, where the voltage response is proportional to the input resistance:\n    $$\\Delta V_{\\text{EPSP}} \\approx I_{\\text{exc}} \\times R_{\\text{in}}$$\n    In the presence of the active GABAergic synapse, the input resistance $R_{\\text{in}}$ is lower. Consequently, the same excitatory current $I_{\\text{exc}}$ will produce a smaller EPSP:\n    $$\\Delta V_{\\text{EPSP, with GABA}} \\approx I_{\\text{exc}} \\times R_{\\text{in, with GABA}}  I_{\\text{exc}} \\times R_{\\text{in, no GABA}} \\approx \\Delta V_{\\text{EPSP, no GABA}}$$\n    The inhibitory synapse effectively \"shunts\" or diverts the excitatory current through the newly opened low-resistance pathway provided by the $\\text{GABA}_{\\text{A}}$ channels. This reduces the magnitude of the voltage change at the soma, making it less likely that the neuron will reach its firing threshold. This inhibitory mechanism is potent even when $E_{\\text{GABA}}$ is close to the resting membrane potential (as it is here, $-70\\,\\text{mV}$ vs $-60\\,\\text{mV}$), because the primary effect is the reduction of input resistance, not necessarily a strong hyperpolarization.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{100}\n$$", "id": "5026794"}, {"introduction": "The strength and even the polarity of inhibition depend critically on the GABAergic reversal potential, $E_{\\text{GABA}}$.

The sums are taken over all permeant cations ($C_k$) and anions ($A_l$). Note that for anions, the intracellular and extracellular concentrations are swapped in the numerator and denominator relative to cations. This is a consequence of their negative charge ($z=-1$), which reverses their contribution to the potential compared to positive ions ($z=+1$).\n\nThe reversal potential for a specific channel, in this case $E_{\\text{GABA}}$, is the value of $V_m$ at which the net current through that channel is zero. The $\\text{GABA}_{\\text{A}}$ receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel primarily permeable to the anions chloride ($\\text{Cl}^{-}$) and bicarbonate ($\\text{HCO}_{3}^{-}$). Therefore, we can adapt the GHK equation by considering only these two anions. The expression for the $\\text{GABA}_{\\text{A}}$ reversal potential, $E_{\\text{GABA}}$, becomes:\n$$\nE_{\\text{GABA}} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{P_{\\text{Cl}}[\\text{Cl}^{-}]_{i} + P_{\\text{HCO}_{3}}[\\text{HCO}_{3}^{-}]_{i}}{P_{\\text{Cl}}[\\text{Cl}^{-}]_{o} + P_{\\text{HCO}_{3}}[\\text{HCO}_{3}^{-}]_{o}} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the appropriate expression for the $\\text{GABA}_{\\text{A}}$ reversal potential when the channel is permeable to multiple anions.

The leak reversal potential $E_{\\text{L}} = -70$ mV is constant.\n\nFirst, we calculate the Nernst potential pre-factor in millivolts:\n$$\n\\frac{R T}{F} \\times 1000 = \\frac{8.314462618 \\, \\text{J/(mol·K)} \\times 310 \\, \\text{K}}{96485.33212 \\, \\text{C/mol}} \\times 1000 \\approx 26.709 \\, \\text{mV}\n$$\nThe reversal potentials are calculated using the Nernst equation, $E_{\\text{ion}} = 1000 \\frac{R T}{z F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\text{ion}]_{\\text{o}}}{[\\text{ion}]_{\\text{i}}}\\right)$:\n\n1.  **Potassium Reversal Potential ($E_{\\text{K}}$)**: For potassium ($K^+$), the valence is $z = +1$. The intracellular concentration is fixed at $[\\text{K}]_{\\text{i}} = 140$ mM. $E_{\\text{K}}$ depends on the variable $[\\text{K}]_{\\text{o}}$ for each case.\n    $$\n    E_{\\text{K}} = 26.709 \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\text{K}]_{\\text{o}}}{140}\\right)\n    $$\n2.  **GABA-A Reversal Potential ($E_{\\text{GABA}}$)**: This is approximated by the chloride reversal potential, $E_{\\text{GABA}} \\approx E_{\\text{Cl}}$. For chloride ($Cl^-$), the valence is $z = -1$. The extracellular concentration is fixed at $[\\text{Cl}]_{\\text{o}} = 120$ mM. The intracellular concentration, $[\\text{Cl}]_{\\text{i}}$, depends on the KCC2 activity parameter $a$.\n    $$\n    [\\text{Cl}]_{\\text{i}}(a) = [\\text{Cl}]_{\\min} + \\left([\\text{Cl}]_{\\max} - [\\text{Cl}]_{\\min}\\right)\\left(1 - a\\right) = 5 \\, \\text{mM} + (20 \\, \\text{mM} - 5 \\, \\text{mM})(1 - a) = 5 + 15(1 - a) \\, \\text{mM}\n    $$\n    The reversal potential is then:\n    $$\n    E_{\\text{GABA}} = E_{\\text{Cl}} = \\frac{26.709}{-1} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\text{Cl}]_{\\text{o}}}{[\\text{Cl}]_{\\text{i}}}\\right) = -26.709 \\ln\\left(\\frac{120}{5 + 15(1 - a)}\\right)\n    $$\nNow we can compute the required $I_{\\text{ext}}$ for each test case by substituting the given conductances ($g_{\\text{L}} = 10$ nS, $g_{\\text{K}} = 5$ nS, $g_{\\text{GABA}} = 8$ nS) and potentials ($V_{\\text{th}} = -50$ mV, $E_{\\text{L}} = -70$ mV) into the main equation.\n\nThe term for the leak current is constant across all cases:\n$$\nI_{\\text{L}} = g_{\\text{L}}(V_{\\text{th}} - E_{\\text{L}}) = 10 \\, \\text{nS} \\times (-50 \\, \\text{mV} - (-70 \\, \\text{mV})) = 10 \\times 20 = 200 \\, \\text{pA}\n$$\nSo the full expression is:\n$$\nI_{\\text{ext}} = 200 + 5( -50 - E_{\\text{K}} ) + 8( -50 - E_{\\text{GABA}} )\n$$\nThe units are consistent: nS $\\times$ mV = $10^{-9}$ S $\\times$ $10^{-3}$ V = $10^{-12}$ A = $1$ pA.\n\n**Calculations for each case:**\n\n- **Case 1: $(a=1.0, [\\text{K}]_{\\text{o}}=3.5)$**\n    - $[\\text{Cl}]_{\\text{i}} = 5 + 15(1-1.0) = 5$ mM\n    - $E_{\\text{K}} = 26.709 \\ln(3.5/140) \\approx -98.519$ mV\n    - $E_{\\text{GABA}} = -26.709 \\ln(120/5) \\approx -84.872$ mV\n    - $I_{\\text{ext}} = 200 + 5(-50 - (-98.519)) + 8(-50 - (-84.872)) = 200 + 5(48.519) + 8(34.872) \\approx 721.571$ pA\n\n- **Case 2: $(a=0.3, [\\text{K}]_{\\text{o}}=3.5)$**\n    - $[\\text{Cl}]_{\\text{i}} = 5 + 15(1-0.3) = 15.5$ mM\n    - $E_{\\text{K}} \\approx -98.519$ mV (same as Case 1)\n    - $E_{\\text{GABA}} = -26.709 \\ln(120/15.5) \\approx -54.659$ mV\n    - $I_{\\text{ext}} = 200 + 5(48.519) + 8(-50 - (-54.659)) = 200 + 5(48.519) + 8(4.659) \\approx 479.867$ pA\n\n- **Case 3: $(a=1.0, [\\text{K}]_{\\text{o}}=8.0)$**\n    - $[\\text{Cl}]_{\\text{i}} = 5$ mM (same as Case 1)\n    - $E_{\\text{K}} = 26.709 \\ln(8.0/140) \\approx -76.447$ mV\n    - $E_{\\text{GABA}} \\approx -84.872$ mV (same as Case 1)\n    - $I_{\\text{ext}} = 200 + 5(-50 - (-76.447)) + 8(34.872) = 200 + 5(26.447) + 8(34.872) \\approx 611.211$ pA\n\n- **Case 4: $(a=0.3, [\\text{K}]_{\\text{o}}=8.0)$**\n    - $[\\text{Cl}]_{\\text{i}} = 15.5$ mM (same as Case 2)\n    - $E_{\\text{K}} \\approx -76.447$ mV (same as Case 3)\n    - $E_{\\text{GABA}} \\approx -54.659$ mV (same as Case 2)\n    - $I_{\\text{ext}} = 200 + 5(26.447) + 8(4.659) \\approx 369.507$ pA\n\n- **Case 5: $(a=0.1, [\\text{K}]_{\\text{o}}=12.0)$**\n    - $[\\text{Cl}]_{\\text{i}} = 5 + 15(1-0.1) = 18.5$ mM\n    - $E_{\\text{K}} = 26.709 \\ln(12.0/140) \\approx -65.619$ mV\n    - $E_{\\text{GABA}} = -26.709 \\ln(120/18.5) \\approx -49.932$ mV\n    - $I_{\\text{ext}} = 200 + 5(-50 - (-65.619)) + 8(-50 - (-49.932)) = 200 + 5(15.619) + 8(-0.068) \\approx 277.551$ pA\n\nThese calculations demonstrate that as KCC2 activity $a$ decreases and extracellular potassium $[\\text{K}]_{\\text{o}}$ increases, the respective reversal potentials $E_{\\text{GABA}}$ and $E_{\\text{K}}$ become more depolarized. A more depolarized reversal potential reduces the magnitude of the hyperpolarizing (outward) current for a given membrane potential below that reversal potential. Consequently, a smaller external excitatory current $I_{\\text{ext}}$ is required to bring the membrane potential to the spike threshold $V_{\\text{th}}$, indicating an increase in neuronal excitability, a hallmark of the specified pathological conditions.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the minimal external excitatory current required to bring a neuron's\n    membrane potential to a spike threshold under different pathophysiological conditions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Fixed physical and biological parameters\n    R = 8.314462618  # Universal gas constant in J/(mol·K)\n    T = 310.0        # Absolute temperature in Kelvin\n    F = 96485.33212  # Faraday's constant in C/mol\n    K_i = 140.0      # Intracellular potassium concentration in mM\n    Cl_o = 120.0     # Extracellular chloride concentration in mM\n    E_L = -70.0      # Leak reversal potential in mV\n    V_th = -50.0     # Spike threshold in mV\n    g_L = 10.0       # Leak conductance in nS\n    g_K = 5.0        # Potassium conductance in nS\n    g_GABA = 8.0     # GABA-A conductance in nS\n    Cl_min = 5.0     # Minimum intracellular chloride in mM\n    Cl_max = 20.0    # Maximum intracellular chloride in mM\n\n    # Calculate the Nernst potential pre-factor (RT/F) and convert to mV\n    nernst_factor_mV = (R * T / F) * 1000.0\n\n    # Test suite: each tuple is (KCC2 activity 'a', extracellular K+ '[K]o' in mM)\n    test_cases = [\n        (1.0, 3.5),\n        (0.3, 3.5),\n        (1.0, 8.0),\n        (0.3, 8.0),\n        (0.1, 12.0),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for a, K_o in test_cases:\n        # Step 1: Calculate intracellular chloride concentration based on KCC2 activity 'a'.\n        # [Cl]_i(a) = [Cl]_min + ([Cl]_max - [Cl]_min) * (1 - a)\n        Cl_i = Cl_min + (Cl_max - Cl_min) * (1 - a)\n\n        # Step 2: Calculate the Nernst reversal potentials for K+ and Cl-.\n        # E_ion = (nernst_factor / z) * ln([ion]_o / [ion]_i)\n        # z for K+ is +1.\n        E_K = (nernst_factor_mV / 1.0) * np.log(K_o / K_i)\n        # z for Cl- is -1.
