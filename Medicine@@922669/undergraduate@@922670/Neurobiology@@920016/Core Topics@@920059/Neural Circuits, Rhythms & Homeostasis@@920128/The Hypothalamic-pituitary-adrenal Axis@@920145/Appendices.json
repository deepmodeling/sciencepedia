This exercise explores the key cellular mechanism that makes this possible: the existence of two receptor types with different affinities for cortisol, the Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR) and the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR). By applying the principles of ligand-receptor binding kinetics, you will calculate the occupancy, $\\theta$, of each receptor type under basal and stress conditions, providing a quantitative understanding of how the HPA axis achieves graded responses [@problem_id:5072468].", "problem": "A central feature of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis is the regulation of target tissue responses by steroid hormone binding to receptors. Cortisol, secreted by the adrenal cortex, binds both the Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR) and the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR). At equilibrium, binding of a ligand to a receptor can be modeled by the law of mass action. Consider a single ligand species with free concentration $F$ (units $\\mathrm{nM}$), a receptor with total concentration $[R_T]$, free receptor concentration $[R]$, and receptor-ligand complex concentration $[RF]$. The equilibrium dissociation constant $K_d$ is defined by $K_d = \\frac{[R][F]}{[RF]}$. The receptor occupancy is defined as the fraction of receptors bound by ligand, $\\theta = \\frac{[RF]}{[R_T]}$. \n\nUsing these fundamental definitions, derive the receptor occupancy $\\theta$ as a function of $F$ and $K_d$ for a single binding site receptor, and then apply the result to compute and compare the occupancies of the Mineralocorticoid Receptor and the Glucocorticoid Receptor across physiologically plausible free cortisol concentrations. Assume cortisol’s equilibrium dissociation constants are $K_{d,\\mathrm{MR}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and $K_{d,\\mathrm{GR}} = 25\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ for the Mineralocorticoid Receptor and the Glucocorticoid Receptor, respectively. \n\nFor the purposes of explicit calculation, take a basal free cortisol level $F_b = 5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ representative of non-stressed conditions and a stress-elevated free cortisol level $F_s = 100\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ within the range $F \\in [1, 500]\\,\\mathrm{nM}$. Compute the Mineralocorticoid Receptor occupancy at $F_b$ and $F_s$, and the Glucocorticoid Receptor occupancy at $F_b$ and $F_s$. Based on these computations and the dependence of occupancy on $F$ and $K_d$, infer which receptor is predominantly engaged under basal versus stress levels.\n\nExpress the final occupancies as exact fractions, in the order $\\left(\\theta_{\\mathrm{MR}}(F_b),\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{GR}}(F_b),\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{MR}}(F_s),\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{GR}}(F_s)\\right)$, and present them as a single row matrix. Occupancy is a unitless fraction; do not include units in the final reported values.", "solution": "The first step is to derive a general expression for receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, as a function of the free ligand concentration, $F$, and the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$.\n\nThe problem provides two fundamental definitions:\n1. The equilibrium dissociation constant:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[R][F]}{[RF]}$$\nwhere $[R]$ is the free receptor concentration, $[F]$ is the free ligand concentration, and $[RF]$ is the concentration of the receptor-ligand complex.\n\n2. The receptor occupancy:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RF]}{[R_T]}$$\nwhere $[R_T]$ is the total receptor concentration.\n\nA third, implicit relationship is the conservation of receptors. The total concentration of receptors, $[R_T]$, must be the sum of the free receptors and the ligand-bound receptors:\n$$[R_T] = [R] + [RF]$$\n\nFrom this conservation equation, we can express the free receptor concentration $[R]$ in terms of $[R_T]$ and $[RF]$:\n$$[R] = [R_T] - [RF]$$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for $K_d$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{([R_T] - [RF])[F]}{[RF]}$$\n\nThe goal is to find an expression for $\\theta = \\frac{[RF]}{[R_T]}$. To do this, we rearrange the equation to solve for this ratio. First, multiply both sides by $[RF]$:\n$$K_d [RF] = ([R_T] - [RF])[F]$$\n\nDistribute $[F]$ on the right-hand side:\n$$K_d [RF] = [R_T][F] - [RF][F]$$\n\nGroup all terms containing $[RF]$ on one side of the equation:\n$$K_d [RF] + [RF][F] = [R_T][F]$$\n\nFactor out $[RF]$ from the left-hand side:\n$$[RF](K_d + F) = [R_T][F]$$\n\nTo obtain the occupancy ratio $\\theta = \\frac{[RF]}{[R_T]}$, we divide both sides by $[R_T]$ and by $(K_d + F)$:\n$$\\frac{[RF]}{[R_T]} = \\frac{F}{K_d + F}$$\n\nTherefore, the receptor occupancy $\\theta$ as a function of $F$ and $K_d$ is:\n$$\\theta(F) = \\frac{F}{F + K_d}$$\nThis relationship is known as the Hill-Langmuir equation for a single, non-cooperative binding site.\n\nThe second part of the task is to compute the occupancies for the Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR) and the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) at basal and stress-induced cortisol levels.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- MR dissociation constant: $K_{d,\\mathrm{MR}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n- GR dissociation constant: $K_{d,\\mathrm{GR}} = 25\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n- Basal free cortisol level: $F_b = 5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n- Stress-elevated free cortisol level: $F_s = 100\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n\nWe now compute the four required occupancy values, which are dimensionless fractions.\n\n1.  **MR occupancy at basal cortisol level ($F_b$):**\n    $$\\theta_{\\mathrm{MR}}(F_b) = \\frac{F_b}{F_b + K_{d,\\mathrm{MR}}} = \\frac{5}{5 + 1} = \\frac{5}{6}$$\n\n2.  **GR occupancy at basal cortisol level ($F_b$):**\n    $$\\theta_{\\mathrm{GR}}(F_b) = \\frac{F_b}{F_b + K_{d,\\mathrm{GR}}} = \\frac{5}{5 + 25} = \\frac{5}{30} = \\frac{1}{6}$$\n\n3.  **MR occupancy at stress cortisol level ($F_s$):**\n    $$\\theta_{\\mathrm{MR}}(F_s) = \\frac{F_s}{F_s + K_{d,\\mathrm{MR}}} = \\frac{100}{100 + 1} = \\frac{100}{101}$$\n\n4.  **GR occupancy at stress cortisol level ($F_s$):**\n    $$\\theta_{\\mathrm{GR}}(F_s) = \\frac{F_s}{F_s + K_{d,\\mathrm{GR}}} = \\frac{100}{100 + 25} = \\frac{100}{125} = \\frac{4}{5}$$\n\nBased on these computations, we can infer the differential engagement of the receptors. At the basal cortisol level of $F_b = 5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, the high-affinity MR is substantially occupied ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{MR}} = 5/6 \\approx 83.3\\%$), while the lower-affinity GR is sparsely occupied ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{GR}} = 1/6 \\approx 16.7\\%$). This indicates that under basal, non-stressed conditions, cortisol's effects are primarily mediated by the Mineralocorticoid Receptor.\n\nAt the stress-elevated cortisol level of $F_s = 100\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, the MR is nearly saturated ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{MR}} = 100/101 \\approx 99\\%$). The most significant change is the dramatic increase in GR occupancy, which rises to $\\theta_{\\mathrm{GR}} = 4/5 = 80\\%$. This shows that the large surge in cortisol during a stress response leads to a substantial engagement of the Glucocorticoid Receptor. Therefore, the GR is the primary mediator of the physiological response to high-concentration stress signals, while the MR is already near maximal engagement. This differential occupancy profile allows the HPA axis to have distinct responses to tonic (basal) and phasic (stress) hormone signals.\n\nThe final answer is a row matrix of the four computed occupancies in the specified order.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{5}{6} & \\frac{1}{6} & \\frac{100}{101} & \\frac{4}{5} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "5072468"}, {"introduction": "Steroid hormones like cortisol are classically known to act by regulating gene expression, a process that is inherently slow.
