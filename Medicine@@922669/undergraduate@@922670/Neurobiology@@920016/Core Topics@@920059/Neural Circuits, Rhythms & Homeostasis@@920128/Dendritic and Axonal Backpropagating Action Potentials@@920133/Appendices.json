When an action potential fires at the axon hillock, it doesn't just travel forward; it also invades the dendritic tree. This first practice challenges you to act like an experimental neuroscientist, analyzing simultaneous recordings from the soma and a distal dendrite to identify the signature of a backpropagating action potential (BAP) and distinguish it from other possible neuronal events [@problem_id:2328247].", "problem": "An electrophysiologist is conducting an experiment on a single neocortical pyramidal neuron in a brain slice preparation. Using the patch-clamp technique, simultaneous whole-cell recordings are established from two locations on the same neuron: one electrode is placed on the soma, and a second electrode is placed on a distal apical dendrite, far from the soma.\n\nWhen the neuron is stimulated to fire a single action potential, the following observations are made:\n1.  The somatic electrode records a classic action potential: a rapid, all-or-none depolarization event that peaks at an amplitude of approximately $+20\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and has a total duration of about $1.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n2.  The dendritic electrode, at nearly the same time, records a distinct, spike-like depolarization. However, this dendritic event is significantly different: its peak amplitude only reaches $-15\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, and its total duration is much longer, around $8\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most plausible neurophysiological explanation for the event recorded at the distal dendrite?\n\nA. The dendritic event is a backpropagating action potential, which has attenuated in amplitude and broadened in time due to the passive cable properties of the dendrite and a lower density of active conductances compared to the soma and axon initial segment.\nB. The dendritic event is a large excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) from a neighboring neuron that, by coincidence, occurred at the same time as the somatic action potential.\nC. The dendritic event is the primary action potential, which initiated in the dendrite and then propagated anterogradely to the soma, where it was recorded in its full form.\nD. The dendritic event is a result of purely passive, or electrotonic, conduction of the somatic action potential, where no voltage-gated ion channels were activated in the dendrite.\nE. The dendritic event is a measurement artifact known as volume conduction, where the dendritic electrode is simply detecting the electrical field generated by the much larger somatic action potential.", "solution": "Define $V_{r}$ as the resting membrane potential, $V_{s}(t)$ as the somatic membrane potential during the spike, and $V_{d}(x,t)$ as the dendritic membrane potential at distance $x$ from the soma. Let $V_{s,\\text{peak}}$ and $V_{d,\\text{peak}}$ denote the peak voltages reached during the event at the soma and dendrite, respectively. The observations imply $V_{s,\\text{peak}}>0$ (classic action potential) and $V_{d,\\text{peak}}<0$ (peak at approximately $-15\\,\\mathrm{mV}$), with durations approximately $1.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ at the soma and $8\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ at the distal dendrite.\n\nFor a passive dendrite, voltage spread from the soma follows the linear cable equation\n$$\n\\tau \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}=\\lambda^{2}\\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x^{2}}-V,\n$$\nwhere $V$ is the deviation from $V_{r}$, $\\tau=R_{m}C_{m}$ is the membrane time constant, and $\\lambda=\\sqrt{\\frac{r_{m}}{r_{i}}}$ is the length constant (with standard notation for membrane and axial resistances). For a steady or very slow input, the amplitude at distance $x$ is attenuated approximately as\n$$\n\\Delta V_{d}(x)\\approx \\Delta V_{s}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta V_{s}=V_{s}-V_{r}$ and $\\Delta V_{d}(x)=V_{d}(x)-V_{r}$. For a fast transient like an action potential, the dendrite acts as a low-pass filter, so high-frequency components are more strongly attenuated and broadened in time. Thus, for a purely passive dendrite,\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta V_{d,\\text{peak}}}{\\Delta V_{s,\\text{peak}}}\\lesssim \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right),\n$$\nwith an expected strong reduction in amplitude and a substantial temporal broadening.\n\nNext, consider active backpropagation. If the dendrite expresses voltage-gated conductances with a peak sodium conductance density $\\bar{g}_{\\text{Na}}(x)$ that is lower than at the axon initial segment and soma, then the backpropagating action potential is supported by local regenerative currents but with smaller $\\frac{dV}{dt}$, reduced peak amplitude, and increased duration relative to the somatic spike. In this case, the dendritic event is not purely the passive transform of the somatic waveform; instead, it is a local spike-like event whose amplitude is limited by lower $\\bar{g}_{\\text{Na}}(x)$ and greater inactivation, and whose width is increased both by local active kinetics (e.g., contributions from $g_{\\text{Ca}}$ and $g_{\\text{K}}$) and by residual cable filtering. This predicts:\n- Attenuation of the peak such that $V_{d,\\text{peak}}$ can remain below $0$ despite a somatic overshoot, consistent with $V_{d,\\text{peak}}\\approx -15\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n- Temporal broadening such that the dendritic event is several times longer than the somatic AP, consistent with a duration of about $8\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ compared to $1.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nCompare alternative explanations against quantitative expectations:\n1) Purely passive electrotonic spread (option D) would yield strong attenuation of a fast spike with $r=\\frac{\\Delta V_{d,\\text{peak}}}{\\Delta V_{s,\\text{peak}}}$ substantially less than $\\exp(-x/\\lambda)$ for large $x$, because high-frequency components are preferentially filtered. For a distal dendrite, $r$ would be expected to be small. The observed large depolarization (on the order of tens of millivolts, approaching about one-half the somatic excursion if one takes $V_{r}$ near typical values) exceeds what passive spread at a distal site would permit, indicating engagement of active dendritic conductances. Moreover, passive filtering alone would produce a smoother, more rounded waveform rather than a distinct spike-like event.\n2) A coincident EPSP (option B) would typically have amplitude $\\Delta V$ of only a few millivolts per synapse, with kinetics on the order of several milliseconds, and would not reproducibly coincide in time with the somatic spike across trials. An EPSP of approximately tens of millivolts is highly implausible without massive synchronous input, and the timing consistency with the somatic AP further argues against coincidence.\n3) A primary dendritic initiation (option C) is unlikely because in neocortical pyramidal neurons action potentials typically initiate at the axon initial segment due to high $\\bar{g}_{\\text{Na}}$, then backpropagate into dendrites. If the spike initiated distally, one would expect a robust local spike with short rise time and potentially substantial overshoot locally, not a subthreshold peak at $-15\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and broad duration. The recorded somatic AP is classic and brief, fitting AIS initiation rather than distal dendritic initiation.\n4) Volume conduction artifact (option E) does not apply to intracellular whole-cell recordings, which measure the true membrane potential inside the cell. Field effects are a concern for extracellular electrodes, not for simultaneous whole-cell patches on the same neuron.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation is a backpropagating action potential that has attenuated and broadened due to the dendrite’s passive cable properties and the lower density of active conductances relative to soma and axon initial segment. This directly accounts for both the reduced peak (remaining below $0$) and the increased duration at the distal dendritic site.\n\nHence the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2328247"}, {"introduction": "Having identified the attenuated and broadened shape of a distal BAP, we now explore the underlying biophysical causes. Why does the BAP's amplitude diminish as it travels away from the soma? This practice [@problem_id:2328227] guides you through an analysis that combines two critical concepts: the passive filtering properties of the dendrite as an electrical cable and the active, regenerative support provided by voltage-gated ion channels. Understanding this interplay is key to grasping how neuronal morphology shapes electrical signaling.", "problem": "An electrophysiologist is studying a cortical pyramidal neuron. An action potential is initiated at the axon hillock and is observed to propagate back into the dendritic tree, a phenomenon known as a Backpropagating Action Potential (bAP). The researcher records the membrane potential simultaneously from two locations on the neuron's apical dendrite:\n1.  **Site P:** A location on a thick primary dendrite, which is proximal (close) to the soma.\n2.  **Site D:** A location on a thin terminal branchlet in the distal tufts, which is far from the soma.\n\nThe experimental recordings show that the peak amplitude of the bAP is significantly smaller at Site D compared to its amplitude at Site P. Assuming that the dendrites can be modeled as imperfect electrical cables and that the density of voltage-gated sodium channels, which actively support propagation, decreases with increasing distance from the soma, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and comprehensive explanation for this observed attenuation?\n\nA. The attenuation is primarily due to the increased membrane resistance per unit length ($r_m$) in the thin distal dendrite, which causes more current to leak out across the membrane before it reaches Site D.\nB. The attenuation is primarily because the thin distal dendrite has a smaller electrical capacitance per unit length ($c_m$), which prevents it from storing enough charge to sustain the action potential's high amplitude.\nC. The attenuation is due to a combination of two factors: the higher axial resistance per unit length ($r_a$) in the thin distal dendrite impeding longitudinal current flow, and the lower density of voltage-gated sodium channels available to regenerate the action potential at distal locations.\nD. The attenuation occurs because the length constant ($\\lambda$) of the dendritic cable is smaller for thinner dendrites, but this passive effect is entirely compensated for by the active boosting from voltage-gated channels, so the observed difference must be due to an experimental artifact.\nE. The attenuation is caused by the lower axial resistance per unit length ($r_a$) in the thin distal dendrite, which allows the depolarizing current to dissipate more quickly along the length of the dendrite.", "solution": "The observation is that the peak of the backpropagating action potential (bAP) is smaller at a distal, thin terminal dendrite (Site D) than at a proximal, thick primary dendrite (Site P). To explain this, we use cable theory and the role of active regeneration by voltage-gated sodium channels.\n\nModel the dendrite as a cylindrical cable with radius $a$. Let $R_{m}$ be the specific membrane resistance (units of resistance times area), $C_{m}$ be the specific membrane capacitance (capacitance per area), and $R_{i}$ be the intracellular resistivity (resistance times length). The per-unit-length parameters used in cable theory are:\n$$\nr_{m}=\\frac{R_{m}}{2\\pi a},\\quad c_{m}=C_{m}\\,2\\pi a,\\quad r_{a}=\\frac{R_{i}}{\\pi a^{2}}.\n$$\nThe spatial attenuation of voltage along a passive cable is governed by the length constant\n$$\n\\lambda=\\sqrt{\\frac{r_{m}}{r_{a}}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m}/(2\\pi a)}{R_{i}/(\\pi a^{2})}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m}a}{2R_{i}}}.\n$$\nThus $\\lambda\\propto \\sqrt{a}$, so thinner dendrites (smaller $a$) have a smaller $\\lambda$, producing stronger passive attenuation with distance. The steady-state or quasi-steady voltage spread in a passive cable decays approximately as $\\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, so a smaller $\\lambda$ at distal thin branches increases attenuation of the bAP as it propagates.\n\nHowever, bAPs are not purely passive: they are actively supported by the local density of voltage-gated sodium channels. If the sodium channel density decreases with distance from the soma, then the regenerative boost is reduced at distal locations, so active mechanisms cannot fully compensate for the stronger passive attenuation in thin dendrites. This simultaneously explains both greater axial current loss and insufficient local regeneration.\n\nWe now evaluate the options in light of the equations:\n\n- Option A is incorrect in both mechanism and sign: since $r_{m}=R_{m}/(2\\pi a)$ increases when $a$ decreases, a thinner dendrite has a larger $r_{m}$, which reduces leak per unit length; increased $r_{m}$ would increase $\\lambda$ if $r_{a}$ were constant. The dominant passive cause of attenuation in thinner dendrites is actually the increase in $r_{a}$, which decreases $\\lambda$.\n\n- Option B is incorrect: $c_{m}=C_{m}\\,2\\pi a$ decreases with decreasing $a$, which makes the local membrane require less charge to change voltage per unit length. This tends to speed local voltage changes rather than preventing amplitude. The amplitude reduction observed is not primarily due to a smaller $c_{m}$.\n\n- Option C correctly identifies both key contributors: (i) the axial resistance per unit length $r_{a}=R_{i}/(\\pi a^{2})$ is higher in thinner distal dendrites, which impedes longitudinal current flow and reduces $\\lambda$, and (ii) the lower density of voltage-gated sodium channels distally reduces active regenerative boosting, so the bAP attenuates more.\n\n- Option D is incorrect because it asserts that passive attenuation is entirely compensated by active boosting. Given the stated decrease in sodium channel density with distance, active boosting is weaker distally and cannot fully counteract the passive losses, so attenuation remains.\n\n- Option E is incorrect in sign: thinner dendrites have higher, not lower, $r_{a}$, which is the correct passive factor contributing to attenuation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and comprehensive explanation is the combined passive and active mechanisms in Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2328227"}, {"introduction": "The propagation of a BAP is not a fixed, all-or-none process; it is dynamically modulated by a host of different ion channels.

These neurons are known to generate action potentials at the axon hillock which then not only propagate down the axon but also travel backward into the neuron's dendritic tree. This phenomenon is known as a backpropagating action potential (bAP). The amplitude of a bAP typically decreases as it travels away from the soma into the distal dendrites.\n\nThe dendritic membranes of these pyramidal neurons possess a significant density of A-type potassium channels. These are voltage-gated channels that open in response to membrane depolarization, but they inactivate very quickly. Their primary function is to cause a rapid, transient outflow of potassium ions, which helps repolarize the membrane and thereby dampens dendritic excitability.\n\nThe scientist adds the pharmacological agent 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) to the extracellular solution bathing the neuron. 4-AP is a well-known and specific blocker of A-type potassium channels. The scientist then stimulates the neuron to fire an action potential and measures the properties of the resulting bAP in a distal dendrite.\n\nBased on the known function of A-type potassium channels, which of the following outcomes is the most likely effect of applying 4-AP on the bAP measured in the distal dendrite?\n\nA. The bAP amplitude will decrease, and its propagation into the dendrite will be less extensive.\nB. The bAP amplitude will increase, and its propagation into the dendrite will be more extensive.\nC. The bAP amplitude will remain unchanged, but its propagation into the dendrite will be more extensive.\nD.

The A-type current is\n$$\nI_{A} \\;=\\; g_{A}\\,m^{p}h^{q}\\,\\left(V-E_{K}\\right),\n$$\nwith $g_{A}$ the maximal A-type conductance, $m$ and $h$ the activation and inactivation variables, $p,q$ positive integers, and $E_{K}$ the potassium reversal potential. Because $E_{K}$ is typically more negative than $V$ during depolarization, $I_{A}$ is an outward current that opposes depolarization and speeds repolarization.\n\nApplying 4-AP blocks A-type channels, which we model as $g_{A}\\to 0$. This removes $I_{A}$ from the right-hand side, thereby reducing the total outward conductance during the bAP. Two immediate consequences follow.\n\nEffect on local bAP amplitude: For a given axial input $I_{\\text{axial}}$ during the spike upstroke, the instantaneous depolarization is limited by the total membrane conductance $g_{\\text{tot}}$, where\n$$\ng_{\\text{tot}} \\;=\\; g_{L} \\;+\\; g_{A} \\;+\\; \\cdots.\n$$\nIn a quasi-steady approximation, the local voltage change satisfies $\\Delta V \\approx I_{\\text{axial}}/g_{\\text{tot}}$. Blocking A-type channels decreases $g_{\\text{tot}}$ (since $g_{A}\\to 0$), which increases $\\Delta V$. Equivalently, with less outward $K^{+}$ current opposing the upstroke, the peak depolarization achieved by the bAP is larger. Thus, the bAP amplitude increases.\n\nEffect on propagation into distal dendrites: In cable theory, passive voltage attenuation with distance $x$ follows\n$$\nV(x) \\;=\\; V(0)\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right),\n$$\nwhere the length constant is\n$$\n\\lambda \\;=\\; \\sqrt{\\frac{r_{m}}{r_{i}}}.\n$$\nHere $r_{m}$ is the membrane resistance per unit length and $r_{i}$ is the axial (internal) resistance per unit length. Since $r_{m} = 1/g_{\\text{tot}}$ per unit area (up to geometry factors), reducing $g_{\\text{tot}}$ by blocking $g_{A}$ increases $r_{m}$ and therefore increases $\\lambda$. An increased $\\lambda$ reduces the rate of spatial decay, so $V(x)$ decays less with distance; i.e., propagation is more extensive into distal dendrites. In addition, removing the fast repolarizing A-type current broadens the spike and can facilitate regenerative activation of voltage-gated sodium channels further along the dendrite, further promoting propagation.\n\nCombining these effects, blocking A-type channels with 4-AP leads to a larger bAP amplitude and more extensive propagation into the dendritic tree.\n\nEvaluating the options, the outcome corresponds to an increased amplitude and more extensive propagation, which matches option B. All other options contradict the effects of reducing the repolarizing, shunting A-type conductance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2328232"}]}
