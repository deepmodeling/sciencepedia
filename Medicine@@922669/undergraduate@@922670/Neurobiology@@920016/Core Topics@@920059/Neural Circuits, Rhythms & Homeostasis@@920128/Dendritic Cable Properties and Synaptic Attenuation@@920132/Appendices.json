A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Cable Equation**\n\nWe model the dendrite as a cylinder of radius $a$. We consider a small segment of the dendrite of infinitesimal length $dx$ located at position $x$. We must first define the electrical properties of this segment in terms of the given specific properties.\n\n1.  **Axial Resistance**: The intracellular medium (axoplasm) has a specific resistivity $R_{i}$. Current flows along the $x$-axis through a cross-sectional area $A = \\pi a^{2}$. The resistance of a segment of length $dx$ is $R_{i} \\frac{dx}{A}$. Thus, the axial resistance per unit length, denoted $r_{i}$, is:\n    $$r_{i} = \\frac{R_{i}}{\\pi a^{2}}$$\n\n2.  **Membrane Resistance**: The specific membrane resistance $R_{m}$ has units of resistance times area. For a segment of length $dx$, the surface area of the membrane is $2\\pi a dx$. The total membrane resistance of this segment is $\\frac{R_{m}}{2\\pi a dx}$. The membrane resistance per unit length, $r_{m}$, is defined as the resistance of a unit length of the membrane cylinder, which is this quantity multiplied by $dx$:\n    $$r_{m} = \\frac{R_{m}}{2\\pi a}$$\n\n3.  **Membrane Capacitance**: The specific membrane capacitance $C_{m}$ has units of capacitance per area. The membrane capacitance of the segment of length $dx$ is $C_{m} (2\\pi a dx)$. Thus, the membrane capacitance per unit length, $c_{m}$, is:\n    $$c_{m} = 2\\pi a C_{m}$$\n\nNow, we apply the principle of conservation of current. Let $I_{i}(x,t)$ be the axial current flowing inside the dendrite. For the segment between $x$ and $x+dx$, the change in axial current must equal the current flowing out through the membrane, $i_{m} dx$, where $i_{m}$ is the membrane current per unit length.\n$$I_{i}(x,t) - I_{i}(x+dx, t) = i_{m}(x,t) dx$$\nIn the limit as $dx \\to 0$, this becomes:\n$$-\\frac{\\partial I_{i}}{\\partial x} = i_{m}$$\n\nAccording to Ohm's law, the axial current $I_{i}$ is driven by the negative gradient of the intracellular voltage $V(x,t)$. The resistance for this current flow is the axial resistance per unit length, $r_{i}$.\n$$V(x) - V(x+dx) = I_{i} (r_{i} dx)$$\nIn the limit as $dx \\to 0$, this yields:\n$$-\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} = I_{i} r_{i} \\implies I_{i} = -\\frac{1}{r_{i}} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $I_{i}$ into the current conservation equation:\n$$-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(-\\frac{1}{r_{i}} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}\\right) = i_{m}$$\nSince $r_{i}$ is constant for a uniform cable, we have:\n$$\\frac{1}{r_{i}} \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x^{2}} = i_{m}$$\n\nThe membrane current per unit length, $i_{m}$, has two components as specified: a resistive leak component, $i_{leak}$, and a capacitive component, $i_{cap}$.\n- The leak current flows through the membrane resistance $r_{m}$: $i_{leak} = \\frac{V}{r_{m}}$, where $V$ is the voltage relative to the resting potential.\n- The capacitive current is proportional to the rate of change of voltage across the membrane capacitance $c_{m}$: $i_{cap} = c_{m} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}$.\nThus, the total membrane current per unit length is:\n$$i_{m} = i_{leak} + i_{cap} = \\frac{V}{r_{m}} + c_{m} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $i_{m}$ back into our differential equation gives the cable equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{r_{i}} \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x^{2}} = \\frac{V}{r_{m}} + c_{m} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}$$\nTo match the requested form, we can write this as:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x^{2}} = \\frac{r_{i}}{r_{m}} V + r_{i} c_{m} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}$$\n\n**Identification of $\\lambda$ and $\\tau$**\nThe canonical form of the one-dimensional cable equation is:\n$$\\lambda^{2} \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x^{2}} = \\tau \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + V$$\nRearranging our derived equation by multiplying by $r_{m}$ gives:\n$$\\frac{r_{m}}{r_{i}} \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x^{2}} = V + r_{m} c_{m} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}$$\nBy comparing this to the canonical form, we can identify the space constant $\\lambda$ and the time constant $\\tau$.\n$$\\lambda^{2} = \\frac{r_{m}}{r_{i}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\tau = r_{m} c_{m}$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $r_{m}$, $r_{i}$, and $c_{m}$ in terms of the fundamental parameters $R_{m}$, $C_{m}$, $R_{i}$, and $a$.\n\nFor the membrane time constant $\\tau$:\n$$\\tau = r_{m} c_{m} = \\left(\\frac{R_{m}}{2\\pi a}\\right) (2\\pi a C_{m}) = R_{m} C_{m}$$\n\nFor the dendritic space constant $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda^{2} = \\frac{r_{m}}{r_{i}} = \\frac{R_{m}/(2\\pi a)}{R_{i}/(\\pi a^{2})} = \\frac{R_{m}}{2\\pi a} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi a^{2}}{R_{i}} = \\frac{R_{m} a}{2 R_{i}}$$\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m} a}{2 R_{i}}}$$\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\nWe are given the following values (converted to SI base units):\n- $a = 1.0\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}$\n- $R_{m} = 1.0\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{m}^{2}$\n- $R_{i} = 1.0\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{m}$\n- $C_{m} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{F}/\\text{m}^{2}$\n\nFirst, we compute the membrane time constant $\\tau$:\n$$\\tau = R_{m} C_{m} = (1.0\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{m}^{2}) (1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{F}/\\text{m}^{2}) = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{s}$$\nTo express this in milliseconds (ms), we multiply by $1000$:\n$$\\tau = (1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{s}) \\times (1000\\,\\text{ms}/\\text{s}) = 10\\,\\text{ms}$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $\\tau = 10.0\\,\\text{ms}$.\n\nNext, we compute the dendritic space constant $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m} a}{2 R_{i}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(1.0\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{m}^{2}) (1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m})}{2 (1.0\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{m})}}$$\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}}{2.0}\\,\\text{m}^{2}} = \\sqrt{0.5 \\times 10^{-6}}\\,\\text{m} = \\sqrt{50 \\times 10^{-8}}\\,\\text{m}$$\n$$\\lambda \\approx 7.0710678... \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{m}$$\nTo express this in millimeters (mm), we multiply by $1000$:\n$$\\lambda \\approx (7.0710678... \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{m}) \\times (1000\\,\\text{mm}/\\text{m}) = 0.70710678...\\,\\text{mm}$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $\\lambda = 0.707\\,\\text{mm}$.\n\nThe final answer is the ordered pair $(\\lambda, \\tau)$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0.707 & 10.0 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "5012278"}, {"introduction": "Now that we have established the theoretical framework, we can use it to explore how dynamic changes in a neuron's state affect its computational properties.

It is therefore deemed **valid**. A solution will now be derived from first principles.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe behavior of voltage $V_m(x, t)$ along a passive cable is described by the cable equation:\n$$ \\lambda^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V_m}{\\partial x^2} = \\tau_m \\frac{\\partial V_m}{\\partial t} + V_m $$\nThe key parameters in this equation are the characteristic spatial decay length (space constant), $\\lambda$, and the membrane time constant, $\\tau_m$. These are determined by the physical properties of the cable.\n\nFirst, we define resistance and capacitance per unit length of the cable. For a cylinder of diameter $d$:\n-   The cross-sectional area for axial current is $A = \\pi (d/2)^2 = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}$. The axial resistance per unit length is $r_i = \\frac{R_i}{A} = \\frac{4 R_i}{\\pi d^2}$.\n-   The surface area per unit length is the circumference $P = \\pi d$. The membrane resistance for a unit length is $r_m = \\frac{R_m}{P} = \\frac{R_m}{\\pi d}$.\n-   The membrane capacitance per unit length is $c_m = C_m P = C_m \\pi d$.\n\nThe **characteristic spatial decay length**, $\\lambda$, governs the steady-state voltage decay. It is defined as:\n$$ \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_m}{r_i}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m/(\\pi d)}{4 R_i/(\\pi d^2)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m d}{4 R_i}} $$\nThe **membrane time constant**, $\\tau_m$, governs the temporal response of the membrane voltage. It is defined as:\n$$ \\tau_m = r_m c_m = \\left(\\frac{R_m}{\\pi d}\\right) (C_m \\pi d) = R_m C_m $$\n\nThe problem states that $R_m$ decreases by a factor of $2$, while $R_i$, $d$, and $C_m$ remain constant. Let the initial state be denoted by subscript $1$ and the final state by subscript $2$. Thus, $R_{m,2} = R_{m,1}/2$.\n\nWe analyze the consequences for $\\lambda$ and $\\tau_m$:\n-   **Change in $\\lambda$**: Since $\\lambda \\propto \\sqrt{R_m}$, the new space constant $\\lambda_2$ is related to the old one $\\lambda_1$ by:\n    $$ \\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m,2}}{R_{m,1}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n    So, the space constant decreases by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n-   **Change in $\\tau_m$**: Since $\\tau_m \\propto R_m$, the new time constant $\\tau_{m,2}$ is related to the old one $\\tau_{m,1}$ by:\n    $$ \\frac{\\tau_{m,2}}{\\tau_{m,1}} = \\frac{R_{m,2}}{R_{m,1}} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n    So, the time constant decreases by a factor of $2$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The characteristic spatial decay length increases by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$, and distal synaptic efficacy at the soma improves.**\nOur derivation shows that the spatial decay length $\\lambda$ *decreases* by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$. A shorter $\\lambda$ means that voltage attenuates more strongly with distance. This would make distal synapses *less* effective at influencing the soma, not improve their efficacy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The characteristic spatial decay length decreases by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$, making distal synapses less effective at the soma for a given distance.**\nOur derivation confirms that $\\lambda$ decreases by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$. In steady-state, voltage from a distal input decays with distance $x$ as $\\sim e^{-x/\\lambda}$. A smaller $\\lambda$ results in a faster decay, so a smaller fraction of the voltage generated at a distal site reaches the soma. This reduces the efficacy of distal synapses.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The membrane time constant decreases by a factor of $2$, tending to shorten the local EPSP time course.**\nOur derivation confirms that $\\tau_m$ decreases by a factor of $2$. The time constant $\\tau_m$ dictates how quickly the membrane potential changes in response to current. A smaller $\\tau_m$ means the membrane charges and discharges more quickly. This leads to a faster rise and, more significantly, a faster decay of the EPSP, thereby shortening its overall duration.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. For the same local synaptic current injected at a site a distance $x$ from the soma, the fraction of that current’s steady-state voltage that reaches the soma is unchanged because $R_i$ did not change.**\nThe fraction of voltage that propagates from a location $x$ to the soma (at $x=0$) is known as the voltage transfer ratio, $V_{soma}/V_{synapse}$. This ratio is a function of the distance $x$ and the space constant $\\lambda$. Since $\\lambda = \\sqrt{R_m d / 4 R_i}$ depends on $R_m$, and $R_m$ changes, $\\lambda$ must change. Therefore, the voltage transfer ratio must also change. The reasoning provided (\"because $R_i$ did not change\") is flawed, as $\\lambda$ depends on both $R_m$ and $R_i$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The input resistance measured at the soma decreases, so for a given distal transmembrane current the somatic voltage change is smaller, compounding the effect of spatial attenuation.**\nThe input resistance of the neuron decreases because the membrane is more \"leaky\" (lower $R_m$). For a semi-infinite cable, the input resistance is $R_{in, \\infty} = \\sqrt{r_m r_i}$, which is proportional to $\\sqrt{R_m}$. For a finite cable with a sealed end at the soma, the input resistance at the soma is $R_{in,0} = \\sqrt{r_m r_i} \\coth(L/\\lambda)$. As $R_m$ decreases, both $\\sqrt{r_m}$ and $\\lambda$ decrease. The decrease in $\\lambda$ increases the argument $L/\\lambda$, which causes $\\coth(L/\\lambda)$ to decrease (for $L>0$). Both factors lead to a decrease in $R_{in,0}$.\nThe somatic voltage change $\\Delta V_{soma}$ due to a distal synaptic current $I_{syn}$ is determined by the transfer impedance, $Z_{transfer}$, where $\\Delta V_{soma} = I_{syn} Z_{transfer}$. This transfer impedance depends on both the local input resistance at the synapse and the spatial decay, both of which decrease when $R_m$ is lowered. A lower $R_m$ means:\n1.  The local voltage depolarization at the synapse for a given current is smaller (as local input resistance is lower).\n2.  The attenuation of this voltage as it propagates to the soma is stronger (as $\\lambda$ is smaller).\nThese two effects compound to significantly reduce the somatic impact of the distal synapse. The statement accurately captures this compound effect and correctly identifies that the somatic input resistance decreases.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**F.

Because the membrane time constant decreases, temporal summation of distal EPSPs at low frequencies becomes more effective at the soma.**\nA decrease in the membrane time constant $\\tau_m$ means that membrane voltage decays more rapidly after a synaptic input. Temporal summation relies on the postsynaptic potential from one input persisting long enough to summate with the potential from a subsequent input. A shorter $\\tau_m$ reduces the duration of individual EPSPs, thus making it *harder* for them to summate. Therefore, a decrease in $\\tau_m$ makes temporal summation *less* effective, not more.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BCEF}$$", "id": "2581478"}, {"introduction": "Real dendrites are rarely uniform cylinders; they branch and taper, adding a layer of morphological complexity.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe electrotonic length, often denoted by a capital letter such as $L$, is a dimensionless measure of distance along a cable, scaled by its characteristic length constant, $\\lambda$. For a non-uniform cable where the radius $a(x)$ changes with position $x$, the local cable properties are also position-dependent.\n\nThe axial resistance per unit length, $r_a(x)$, is the intracellular resistivity $R_i$ divided by the cross-sectional area $\\pi a(x)^2$.\n$$ r_a(x) = \\frac{R_i}{\\pi a(x)^2} $$\nThe membrane resistance for a unit length of the cylinder, $r_m(x)$, is the specific membrane resistance $R_m$ divided by the circumference $2\\pi a(x)$.\n$$ r_m(x) = \\frac{R_m}{2\\pi a(x)} $$\nThe local space constant, $\\lambda(x)$, is defined as the square root of the ratio of the membrane resistance per unit length to the axial resistance per unit length.\n$$ \\lambda(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_m(x)}{r_a(x)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m / (2\\pi a(x))}{R_i / (\\pi a(x)^2)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m \\pi a(x)^2}{2\\pi a(x) R_i}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m a(x)}{2 R_i}} $$\nThe electrotonic distance $X$ to a point at physical distance $x$ in a non-uniform cable is the integral of the differential electrotonic length element $dX = dx'/\\lambda(x')$. The total electrotonic length of the dendrite, $L_{electro}$, is the integral of this quantity over the entire physical length $L_{\\mathrm{phys}}$ of the cable.\n$$ L_{electro} = \\int_0^{L_{\\mathrm{phys}}} \\frac{1}{\\lambda(x)} dx $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\lambda(x)$:\n$$ L_{electro} = \\int_0^{L_{\\mathrm{phys}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 R_i}{R_m a(x)}} dx = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 R_i}{R_m}} \\int_0^{L_{\\mathrm{phys}}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a(x)}} dx $$\nThis is the general expression for the electrotonic length for a dendrite with a varying radius $a(x)$.\n\nNext, we evaluate this integral for the given linear radius profile:\n$$ a(x) = a_0 + \\left(\\frac{a_L - a_0}{L_{\\mathrm{phys}}}\\right)x $$\nLet's define the slope of the taper as $m = \\frac{a_L - a_0}{L_{\\mathrm{phys}}}$. The radius profile is then $a(x) = a_0 + mx$. Substituting this into the integral:\n$$ L_{electro} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 R_i}{R_m}} \\int_0^{L_{\\mathrm{phys}}} (a_0 + mx)^{-1/2} dx $$\nThe integral can be solved analytically:\n$$ \\int (a_0 + mx)^{-1/2} dx = \\frac{1}{m} \\frac{(a_0 + mx)^{1/2}}{1/2} + C = \\frac{2}{m} \\sqrt{a_0 + mx} + C $$\nEvaluating the definite integral from $x=0$ to $x=L_{\\mathrm{phys}}$:\n$$ \\int_0^{L_{\\mathrm{phys}}} (a_0 + mx)^{-1/2} dx = \\frac{2}{m} \\left[ \\sqrt{a_0 + mx} \\right]_0^{L_{\\mathrm{phys}}} = \\frac{2}{m} (\\sqrt{a_0 + m L_{\\mathrm{phys}}} - \\sqrt{a_0}) $$\nBy definition of $m$, we have $a_0 + m L_{\\mathrm{phys}} = a_0 + \\left(\\frac{a_L - a_0}{L_{\\mathrm{phys}}}\\right)L_{\\mathrm{phys}} = a_L$. Thus, the expression becomes:\n$$ \\frac{2}{m} (\\sqrt{a_L} - \\sqrt{a_0}) = \\frac{2 L_{\\mathrm{phys}}}{a_L - a_0}(\\sqrt{a_L} - \\sqrt{a_0}) $$\nUsing the difference of squares, $a_L - a_0 = (\\sqrt{a_L} - \\sqrt{a_0})(\\sqrt{a_L} + \\sqrt{a_0})$, we can simplify this term:\n$$ \\frac{2 L_{\\mathrm{phys}}}{(\\sqrt{a_L} - \\sqrt{a_0})(\\sqrt{a_L} + \\sqrt{a_0})}(\\sqrt{a_L} - \\sqrt{a_0}) = \\frac{2 L_{\\mathrm{phys}}}{\\sqrt{a_L} + \\sqrt{a_0}} $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $L_{electro}$:\n$$ L_{electro} = \\frac{2 L_{\\mathrm{phys}}}{\\sqrt{a_0} + \\sqrt{a_L}} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 R_i}{R_m}} $$\nNow, we perform the numerical calculation. First, all parameters must be converted to a consistent unit system.
