Give exact values in fractional form; do not round.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- The organism is a nocturnal mammal in constant darkness.\n- The free-running period of the circadian oscillator is $\\tau$.\n- Activity onset is a fixed-phase event, meaning successive onsets are separated by an interval of $\\tau$.\n- The actogram is plotted against a $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ wall-clock.\n- The observed daily drift of activity onset is an advance of $10\\,\\mathrm{min}$ per wall-clock day.\n- The number of days for the second calculation is $14$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, describing a standard experimental paradigm in chronobiology (free-running rhythm in constant darkness) and using standard terminology ($\\tau$, SCN, actogram, advance/delay). The given data, a daily advance of $10\\,\\mathrm{min}$, corresponds to a free-running period of $23\\,\\mathrm{h}\\;50\\,\\mathrm{min}$, which is a physiologically realistic value for a mammal. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to establish a quantitative relationship and compute the required values. The language is objective and precise. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the relationship between the daily drift in onset time, the free-running period $\\tau$, and the period of the wall-clock, followed by calculations based on this relationship.\n\nLet $T_w$ represent the period of the wall-clock, which is given as $T_w = 24\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\nLet $\\tau$ be the intrinsic, free-running period of the organism's circadian pacemaker. By definition, the time interval between two consecutive activity onsets is exactly $\\tau$.\nLet $\\Delta t$ be the daily drift in the clock time of activity onset, as observed on an actogram. An actogram plots activity with respect to a $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ time-of-day axis, with each day stacked vertically.\n\nConsider the time of activity onset on day $n$, which we can call $t_n$. The next activity onset will occur $\\tau$ hours later, at an absolute time of $t_n + \\tau$. When this new onset is plotted on the actogram for day $n+1$, its time $t_{n+1}$ is compared to $t_n$. The daily drift $\\Delta t$ is the difference in the apparent clock time of onset from one day to the next.\n\nThe crucial insight is that the apparent drift is the result of the mismatch between the organism's internal period $\\tau$ and the external reference period $T_w = 24\\,\\mathrm{h}$. If an event happens at clock time $t_{day\\,1}$ on day 1, the next equivalent event for the clock occurs at $t_{day\\,1}$ on day 2, which is $24$ hours later. However, the next biological event (activity onset) occurs $\\tau$ hours later. The difference between these two intervals gives the daily shift in onset time.\n\nTherefore, the daily drift $\\Delta t$ is given by the equation:\n$$\n\\Delta t = \\tau - T_w\n$$\nIf $\\tau  T_w$, $\\Delta t$ is negative, corresponding to an \"advance\" (the event occurs earlier each day). If $\\tau > T_w$, $\\Delta t$ is positive, corresponding to a \"delay\" (the event occurs later each day).\n\nThe problem states that the activity onset advances by $10\\,\\mathrm{min}$ per wall-clock day. An advance is a negative drift. We must convert this to hours to be consistent with the units of $T_w$.\n$$\n\\Delta t = -10\\,\\mathrm{min} = -10\\,\\mathrm{min} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{h}}{60\\,\\mathrm{min}} = -\\frac{10}{60}\\,\\mathrm{h} = -\\frac{1}{6}\\,\\mathrm{h}\n$$\n\n**1. Compute the free-running period $\\tau$.**\n\nWe can now use the derived relationship to solve for $\\tau$.\n$$\n\\tau = T_w + \\Delta t\n$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$\n\\tau = 24\\,\\mathrm{h} + \\left(-\\frac{1}{6}\\,\\mathrm{h}\\right) = 24 - \\frac{1}{6}\\,\\mathrm{h}\n$$\nTo express this as a single fraction:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{24 \\times 6}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{144 - 1}{6} = \\frac{143}{6}\\,\\mathrm{h}\n$$\nSo, the free-running period is $\\frac{143}{6}$ hours.\n\n**2. Compute the net phase angle change over $14$ consecutive days.**\n\nThe problem asks for the \"net phase angle change\" of the activity onset relative to its initial clock-time. The request to express this quantity in hours, along with the parenthetical note about sign conventions, indicates that \"phase angle\" is being used in the chronobiological sense to mean a time shift, not an angle in radians or degrees. This is standard terminology in the field.\n\nThe total change is the daily drift multiplied by the number of days, $N = 14$. Let's denote the total change as $\\Delta T_{total}$.\n$$\n\\Delta T_{total} = N \\times \\Delta t\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{total} = 14 \\times \\left(-\\frac{1}{6}\\,\\mathrm{h}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta T_{total} = -\\frac{14}{6}\\,\\mathrm{h}\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{total} = -\\frac{7}{3}\\,\\mathrm{h}\n$$\nThe net change in onset time over $14$ days is a total advance of $\\frac{7}{3}$ hours. This is the signed value requested.\nIn summary, the free-running period $\\tau$ is $\\frac{143}{6}\\,\\mathrm{h}$, and the total phase shift over $14$ days is $-\\frac{7}{3}\\,\\mathrm{h}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{143}{6}  -\\frac{7}{3} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "5008602"}, {"introduction": "A reliable clock must keep accurate time despite environmental fluctuations, and for a biological clock, temperature is a major challenge.

A process is considered temperature compensated if its rate is largely insensitive to temperature changes. This property is critical for a functional biological clock, which must keep accurate time despite fluctuations in body temperature.

The fact that the oscillator's period is nearly constant, changing only from $23.8$ to $24.0$ hours, is the hallmark of temperature compensation. Therefore, based on the $Q_{10}$ value being close to $1.0$, the SCN oscillator is indeed robustly temperature compensated over this physiological range.

When light is presented during the biological night, the SCN’s timing can be shifted earlier (phase advance) or later (phase delay) depending on circadian phase.

The term $Z(\\theta)L(t)$ represents the perturbation caused by the light input $L(t)$, modulated by the phase-dependent sensitivity of the oscillator, which is described by the Phase Response Curve (PRC), $Z(\\theta)$.\n\nThe net phase shift, denoted $\\Delta\\theta_{\\text{net}}$, is the total change in phase induced by the stimulus, beyond the natural progression of the oscillator. It is obtained by integrating the perturbation term over the duration of the light stimulus. If the light stimulus $L(t) = 1$ is applied over a time interval from $t_0$ to $t_f$ and is $0$ otherwise, the net phase shift is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\theta_{\\text{net}} = \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} Z(\\theta(t)) \\cdot 1 \\, dt = \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} Z(\\theta(t)) dt\n$$\nThe sign of $\\Delta\\theta_{\\text{net}}$ determines the direction of the shift. By convention, a positive net change in phase ($\\Delta\\theta_{\\text{net}} > 0$) corresponds to a phase advance (the internal clock runs faster, events occur earlier), and a negative net change ($\\Delta\\theta_{\\text{net}}  0$) corresponds to a phase delay (the internal clock runs slower, events occur later).\n\nThe sign of the integral is determined by the sign of the integrand, $Z(\\theta(t))$, over the integration interval $[t_0, t_f]$.\n*   If $Z(\\theta(t))$ is predominantly positive during the light pulse, the integral will be positive, resulting in a phase advance.\n*   If $Z(\\theta(t))$ is predominantly negative during the light pulse, the integral will be negative, resulting in a phase delay.\n\nThe specific PRC for the nocturnal rodent is given as $Z(\\theta) = K\\sin(\\theta - \\frac{3\\pi}{2})$. Using the trigonometric identity $\\sin(x - \\frac{3\\pi}{2}) = \\cos(x)$, we can rewrite the PRC as:\n$$\nZ(\\theta) = K\\cos(\\theta)\n$$\nwhere $K = \\pi/6$ is a positive constant. Thus, the sign of the phase shift is determined by the sign of $\\cos(\\theta)$ at the time of the light pulse.\n\nWe can relate the phase $\\theta$ to Circadian Time (CT) using $\\theta = 2\\pi(\\mathrm{CT}/24)$.\n*   **Subjective Day (CT$0$ - CT$12$):** $\\theta$ ranges from $0$ to $\\pi$.

In this interval (the third quadrant), $\\cos(\\theta)  0$.

Therefore, light presented during this time window will cause $Z(\\theta)$ to be positive, leading to a phase advance ($\\Delta\\theta_{\\text{net}} > 0$).\n\nFor a light window of finite duration, the net shift is the integral of $Z(\\theta(t))$ across that window. If the window spans regions where $Z(\\theta)$ changes sign, the net shift will be the sum of positive (advancing) and negative (delaying) contributions. The final result depends on which contribution is larger, which is determined by the start time of the pulse and its duration.
