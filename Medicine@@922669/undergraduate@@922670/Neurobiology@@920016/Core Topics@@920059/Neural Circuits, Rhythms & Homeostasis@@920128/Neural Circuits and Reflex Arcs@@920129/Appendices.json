Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe neuron is modeled as an electrical circuit where an excitatory synaptic conductance is added in parallel to the resting leak conductance of the membrane. The membrane potential, $V_m$, is determined by the balance of currents flowing across the membrane. According to Kirchhoff's current law, the sum of all currents must be zero at steady state.\n\nThe total membrane current, $I_{total}$, is the sum of the leak current, $I_{leak}$, and the synaptic current, $I_{syn}$.\n$$I_{total} = I_{leak} + I_{syn}$$\nEach current is described by Ohm's law: $I_i = g_i(V_m - E_i)$, where $g_i$ is the conductance and $E_i$ is the reversal potential for the $i$-th ion channel population.\nThus, the currents are:\n$$I_{leak} = g_{leak}(V_m - E_{leak})$$\n$$I_{syn} = g_{syn}(V_m - E_{syn})$$\n\nFirst, we determine the leak conductance, $g_{leak}$, from the input resistance at rest, $R_{in}$. At rest, the synaptic conductance is zero ($g_{syn} = 0$), and the input resistance is the inverse of the total membrane conductance, which is just the leak conductance.\n$$R_{in} = \\frac{1}{g_{leak}}$$\nGiven $R_{in} = 2\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega = 2 \\times 10^6\\,\\Omega$, the leak conductance is:\n$$g_{leak} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 10^6\\,\\Omega} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{S} = 500 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S} = 500\\,\\mathrm{nS}$$\n\nAt the resting state, $V_m = V_{rest}$, and the only current flowing is the leak current. For the membrane potential to be stable at $V_{rest}$, the net current must be zero. This implies that the resting potential must be equal to the leak reversal potential.\n$$I_{leak} = g_{leak}(V_{rest} - E_{leak}) = 0 \\implies E_{leak} = V_{rest} = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n\nAt the peak of the synaptic event, the synaptic conductance is maximal ($g_{syn} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{nS}$), and the membrane potential reaches a new steady-state value, which we denote as $V_{peak}$. At this peak, the total current across the membrane is again zero:\n$$I_{total} = I_{leak} + I_{syn} = 0$$\n$$g_{leak}(V_{peak} - E_{leak}) + g_{syn}(V_{peak} - E_{syn}) = 0$$\n\nWe can solve this equation for $V_{peak}$:\n$$V_{peak}(g_{leak} + g_{syn}) = g_{leak}E_{leak} + g_{syn}E_{syn}$$\n$$V_{peak} = \\frac{g_{leak}E_{leak} + g_{syn}E_{syn}}{g_{leak} + g_{syn}}$$\nThis equation shows that the resulting membrane potential is the weighted average of the reversal potentials, where the conductances are the weights.\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n- $g_{leak} = 500\\,\\mathrm{nS}$\n- $E_{leak} = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n- $g_{syn} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{nS}$\n- $E_{syn} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n\n$$V_{peak} = \\frac{(500\\,\\mathrm{nS})(-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}) + (0.5\\,\\mathrm{nS})(0\\,\\mathrm{mV})}{500\\,\\mathrm{nS} + 0.5\\,\\mathrm{nS}}$$\n$$V_{peak} = \\frac{-32500}{500.5}\\,\\mathrm{mV} \\approx -64.9350649\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the amplitude of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), which is the change in membrane potential from rest, $\\Delta V$.\n$$\\Delta V = V_{peak} - V_{rest}$$\n$$\\Delta V = (-64.9350649\\,\\mathrm{mV}) - (-65\\,\\mathrm{mV})$$\n$$\\Delta V = 0.0649350649\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n\nThe final step is to round the result to three significant figures.
