From the counts, there are positive-probability transitions along the biologically plausible adjacency pathways reflecting typical sleep architecture: $W \\leftrightarrow N1$ (with $C_{W,N1} = 120$, $C_{N1,W} = 120$), $N1 \\leftrightarrow N2$ ($140$ each way), $N2 \\leftrightarrow N3$ ($160$ each way), and $N2 \\leftrightarrow REM$ ($90$ each way). There are also $W \\leftrightarrow REM$ transitions ($60$ each way) reflecting brief arousals out of Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep. Therefore, from any state, there exists a path of positive-probability transitions to any other state (e.g., $N3 \\to N2 \\to REM$; $REM \\to W \\to N1 \\to N2 \\to N3$), establishing irreducibility.\n- Aperiodicity: A state has period $d \\ge 1$ defined as the greatest common divisor of the lengths of all return times to the state.
