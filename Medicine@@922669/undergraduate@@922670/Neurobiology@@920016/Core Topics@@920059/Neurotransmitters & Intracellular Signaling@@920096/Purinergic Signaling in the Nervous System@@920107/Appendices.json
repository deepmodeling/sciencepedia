The problem statement is scientifically valid and well-posed, providing all necessary parameters to apply established biophysical models of molecular transport in porous media.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing diffusion in a complex, obstructed medium like the ECS is that the rate of diffusion is reduced compared to that in a free solution. This hindrance is primarily due to the tortuous paths that molecules must navigate around cellular obstacles (neurons and glia). The tortuosity, $\\lambda$, is a dimensionless factor that quantifies this effect. It is defined as the square root of the ratio of the free diffusion coefficient ($D$) to the effective diffusion coefficient ($D_{eff}$), such that $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/D_{eff}}$.\n\nRearranging this definition provides the standard formula for calculating the effective diffusion coefficient:\n$$D_{eff} = \\frac{D}{\\lambda^2}$$\nThis equation indicates that the effective diffusion is inversely proportional to the square of the tortuosity. The squared term arises because the diffusion time over a given macroscopic distance is proportional to the square of the actual path length, which is, on average, $\\lambda$ times the straight-line distance.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nThe free diffusion coefficient of ATP, $D = 300\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nThe tortuosity of the cortical ECS, $\\lambda = 1.6$.\n\nThe problem also provides the extracellular volume fraction, $\\alpha = 0.2$. It is crucial to correctly interpret the roles of $\\lambda$ and $\\alpha$. The tortuosity $\\lambda$ accounts for the increased path length and geometric obstruction, directly modifying the diffusion coefficient itself. The volume fraction $\\alpha$, which represents the proportion of the total tissue volume available for diffusion, primarily affects the concentration of a substance. For a given quantity of a substance released into the ECS, the resulting concentration is inversely proportional to the available volume, which is scaled by $\\alpha$. However, in the standard Fickian diffusion model for the ECS, $\\alpha$ does not enter into the expression for $D_{eff}$. Therefore, for the calculation of the effective diffusion coefficient, $\\alpha$ is extraneous information.\n\nWe proceed by substituting the given values for $D$ and $\\lambda$ into the equation for $D_{eff}$:\n$$D_{eff} = \\frac{300\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{(1.6)^2}$$\nFirst, we compute the square of the tortuosity:\n$$(1.6)^2 = 2.56$$\nNow, we calculate the value of $D_{eff}$:\n$$D_{eff} = \\frac{300}{2.56}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 117.1875\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$D_{eff} \\approx 117\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThis result represents the diffusion coefficient of ATP as it would be measured on a macroscopic scale within the brain tissue, accounting for the hindrances imposed by the cellular architecture.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{117}$$", "id": "5055234"}, {"introduction": "The heart of purinergic signaling is the binding of a ligand, such as ADP, to its receptor.
