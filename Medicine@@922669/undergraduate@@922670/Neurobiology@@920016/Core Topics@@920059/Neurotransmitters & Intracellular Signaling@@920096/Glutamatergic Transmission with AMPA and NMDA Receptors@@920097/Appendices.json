The descriptions of AMPAR and NMDAR properties, the use of voltage clamp, the synaptic current equation, the composition of ACSF, and the specified pharmacological agents (D-AP5, NBQX, gabazine) are all standard, factually correct, and central to the field of neurobiology.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It clearly defines a goal (isolate AMPAR and NMDAR currents) and provides the necessary biophysical and pharmacological principles to logically deduce a correct experimental design. The question asks for a \"scientifically sound and internally consistent pair of protocols,\" which allows for a unique best answer to be identified from the options.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjectivity, ambiguity, or opinion. All terms are standard within the discipline.\n\nThe problem statement exhibits no flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or ill-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution will proceed by deriving the principles for isolating each current type and then evaluating the given options.\n\n### Derivation of Correct Protocols\n\nThe total synaptic current, $I_{\\text{syn}}$, evoked by glutamate release is the sum of the currents through AMPARs and NMDARs: $I_{\\text{syn}} = I_{\\text{AMPAR}} + I_{\\text{NMDAR}}$. To isolate one component, the other must be eliminated or minimized.\n\n**Isolation of AMPAR-mediated Current ($I_{\\text{AMPAR}}$):**\nTo measure $I_{\\text{AMPAR}}$, we must eliminate $I_{\\text{NMDAR}}$. This can be achieved in two primary ways:\n\n1.  **Biophysical Isolation:** The most common method leverages the voltage-dependent $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ block of NMDARs.\n    - In the presence of physiological extracellular $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ (e.g., $1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ as in standard ACSF), setting the holding potential $V_m$ to a negative value (e.g., $-70\\ \\mathrm{mV}$) will cause $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ ions to enter and block the NMDAR pore.\n    - This drastically reduces NMDAR conductance ($g_{\\text{NMDAR}} \\to 0$), effectively silencing the NMDAR component of the current.\n    - AMPARs are not blocked under these conditions and will mediate an inward current, since $V_m (-70\\ \\mathrm{mV})  E_{\\text{rev}} (0\\ \\mathrm{mV})$.\n    - Thus, the recorded current is almost purely $I_{\\text{AMPAR}}$.\n\n2.  **Pharmacological Isolation:** Apply a selective NMDAR antagonist, such as D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (D-AP5). This will block NMDARs regardless of the holding potential, leaving only $I_{\\text{AMPAR}}$.\n\nThe first method is often preferred for its simplicity in separating the two components based on voltage alone.\n\n**Isolation of NMDAR-mediated Current ($I_{\\text{NMDAR}}$):**\nTo measure $I_{\\text{NMDAR}}$, we must eliminate $I_{\\text{AMPAR}}$ and ensure conditions are permissive for NMDAR activation.\n\n1.  **Pharmacological Block of AMPARs:** $I_{\\text{AMPAR}}$ must be blocked using a selective AMPAR antagonist, such as 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX) or a similar compound (e.g., CNQX). This sets $g_{\\text{AMPAR}}$ to $0$.\n\n2.  **Relief of $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ Block:** To allow NMDARs to pass current, the voltage-dependent $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ block must be removed. This is achieved by setting the holding potential $V_m$ to a positive, depolarized value (e.g., $+40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$). At this potential, the positively charged $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ ion is electrostatically repelled from the pore, allowing other cations to flow. The resulting current will be outward, as $V_m (+40\\ \\mathrm{mV}) > E_{\\text{rev}} (0\\ \\mathrm{mV})$.\n\n3.  **Co-agonist Requirement:** NMDARs require a co-agonist (glycine or D-serine). While endogenous levels may be present, adding a saturating concentration of a co-agonist (e.g., glycine at $10\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$) to the ACSF ensures that NMDAR activation is not limited by co-agonist availability, leading to a more robust and reliable measurement.\n\n**General Requirement:** Since recordings are made at both negative and positive potentials, and inhibitory currents can contaminate the recordings, blocking GABA$_\\text{A}$ receptors with an antagonist like gabazine is crucial, especially at depolarized potentials where the driving force for $\\mathrm{Cl^-}$ is large. The problem statement correctly notes this is a general condition for all recordings.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. AMPAR isolation: hold at $V_m=-70\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ in ACSF with $1\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ and $2\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$, include gabazine $10\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to block GABA$_\\text{A}$ receptors; apply D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (D-AP5) $50\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$ as a control to confirm insensitivity to NMDAR blockade. NMDAR isolation: hold at $V_m=+40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ in ACSF with $1\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$, $2\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$, and glycine $10\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$, include 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX) $5-10\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to block AMPARs and gabazine $10\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.**\n- **AMPAR isolation protocol:** Holding at $V_m = -70\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ in standard ACSF containing $1\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ correctly utilizes the voltage-dependent $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ block to minimize $I_{\\text{NMDAR}}$. The inclusion of gabazine is appropriate. The mention of applying D-AP5 as a control is a correct description of a validation step, confirming the success of the biophysical isolation. This protocol is sound.\n- **NMDAR isolation protocol:** Holding at $V_m = +40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ correctly relieves the $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ block. Using NBQX correctly blocks $I_{\\text{AMPAR}}$. Adding glycine correctly ensures co-agonist saturation. Including gabazine correctly blocks inhibitory currents. This protocol is sound.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option presents the canonical, scientifically sound, and internally consistent pair of protocols for isolating AMPAR and NMDAR currents.\n\n**B. AMPAR isolation: hold at $V_m=+40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ in $0\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ ACSF and add NBQX $10\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$; NMDAR isolation: hold at $V_m=-70\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ in $0\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ ACSF with no AMPAR blocker.**\n- **AMPAR isolation protocol:** This protocol is nonsensical. It proposes to measure AMPAR current while blocking AMPARs with NBQX. This would measure no AMPAR current.\n- **NMDAR isolation protocol:** This protocol fails to isolate NMDARs. At $V_m = -70\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ and without an AMPAR blocker, the current would be heavily dominated by the fast, large AMPAR component. The removal of $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ would allow some NMDAR current to flow, but it would be mixed with, and much smaller than, the AMPAR current.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. Both protocols are fundamentally flawed.\n\n**C. AMPAR isolation: hold at $V_m=-70\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ in $0\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ ACSF with gabazine $10\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$ only; NMDAR isolation: hold at $V_m=+40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ and add D-AP5 $50\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$ without any AMPAR blocker.**\n- **AMPAR isolation protocol:** The use of $0\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ ACSF is a critical error. Without extracellular $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$, NMDARs are not blocked at negative potentials. Therefore, holding at $V_m = -70\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ would result in a mixed current of both AMPARs and NMDARs, failing the isolation objective.\n- **NMDAR isolation protocol:** This protocol is also incorrect. It proposes to isolate NMDAR current by adding D-AP5, which is an NMDAR *blocker*. This would eliminate the very current it aims to measure. The current recorded under these conditions (at $V_m = +40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ with no AMPAR blocker) would be a pure AMPAR current.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. Both protocols are fundamentally flawed and demonstrate a misunderstanding of the required conditions.\n\n**D. AMPAR isolation: hold at $V_m=+40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ in ACSF with $1\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ and add D-AP5 $50\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$; NMDAR isolation: hold at $V_m=-70\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ in ACSF with $1\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ and add NBQX $10\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.**\n- **AMPAR isolation protocol:** This protocol *is* a valid way to isolate an AMPAR current. By pharmacologically blocking NMDARs with D-AP5, the remaining current at any voltage is purely from AMPARs. Measuring at $V_m = +40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ would yield an outward AMPAR current.\n- **NMDAR isolation protocol:** This protocol is critically flawed. While it correctly blocks AMPARs with NBQX, it attempts to measure NMDAR current at $V_m = -70\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ in the presence of $1\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$. Under these conditions, the NMDARs are biophysically blocked by $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$, so virtually no current would be recorded.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. Because the pair of protocols must be internally consistent and sound, the failure of the NMDAR isolation protocol invalidates this option as a whole.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5021215"}, {"introduction": "While AMPA receptors are known for mediating fast, large-amplitude currents, NMDA receptor currents have a characteristically slower rise time and a much more prolonged duration.

A fixed fraction $f_{\\mathrm{Ca}}=0.10$ of the NMDA current is carried by calcium ions, giving $I_{\\mathrm{Ca}}(t)=f_{\\mathrm{Ca}}\\,I_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}(t)$.\n4. The intracellular calcium concentration $C(t)$ in a local dendritic microdomain follows first-order clearance with influx driven by $I_{\\mathrm{Ca}}(t)$: $\\dfrac{dC}{dt}=-\\dfrac{C}{\\tau}+\\alpha\\,I_{\\mathrm{Ca}}(t)$, where $\\tau=50\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ and $\\alpha=0.02\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}/(\\mathrm{pA}\\cdot\\mathrm{ms})$. The initial concentration is at baseline, $C(0)=0$.\n5.
