By setting a low intracellular chloride concentration, KCC2 ensures that the reversal potential for $GABA_A$ receptors ($E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$) is more negative than the neuron's spike threshold. This practice will guide you in calculating the synaptic driving force ($V_m - E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$) to quantitatively determine if a GABAergic input is hyperpolarizing and thus inhibitory, a crucial factor in preventing runaway excitation in neural circuits [@problem_id:5007488].", "problem": "A cortical neuron maintains low intracellular chloride through the activity of the Potassium-Chloride Cotransporter 2 (KCC2). Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid type A ($GABA_A$) receptors primarily conduct chloride, and their reversal potential $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$ approximates the chloride equilibrium potential. A synaptic activation produces a transient increase in the $GABA_A$ conductance $g_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$, adding an ohmic conductance to the membrane. Assume the membrane obeys passive membrane dynamics: the net ionic current is the sum of conductance-driven currents that each move the membrane potential $V_m$ toward their respective reversal potentials.\n\nStarting from these principles and definitions, derive the condition under which a transient increase in $g_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$ acts inhibitory at an instantaneous membrane potential $V_m$.

Provide only the numerical value of the driving force as your final answer.", "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of cellular neurophysiology, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation.\n\nThe first task is to derive the condition under which a transient increase in the $GABA_A$ conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$, is inhibitory. According to the problem statement, the membrane can be modeled using passive dynamics where ionic currents are described by an ohmic relationship. The current carried by $GABA_A$ receptors, $I_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$, is given by:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{GABA}} = g_{\\mathrm{GABA}}(V_m - E_{\\mathrm{GABA}})\n$$\nwhere $V_m$ is the instantaneous membrane potential and $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$ is the reversal potential for the $GABA_A$ current, which is approximately the Nernst potential for chloride ions ($E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$). By convention in electrophysiology, a positive current represents the outward flow of positive charge (or inward flow of negative charge), which leads to hyperpolarization. A negative current represents the inward flow of positive charge (or outward flow of negative charge), which leads to depolarization.\n\nThe change in membrane potential over time is governed by the membrane equation:\n$$\nC_m \\frac{dV_m}{dt} = -I_{\\mathrm{ion}}\n$$\nwhere $C_m$ is the membrane capacitance and $I_{\\mathrm{ion}}$ is the total ionic current flowing across the membrane. When the $GABA_A$ conductance is activated, the total ionic current includes the $GABA_A$ current, $I_{\\mathrm{ion}} = I_{\\mathrm{GABA}} + I_{\\mathrm{other}}$, where $I_{\\mathrm{other}}$ represents all other currents. The instantaneous effect of the GABAergic input on the membrane potential is determined by the sign of $I_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$.\n\nAn inhibitory action is one that makes a neuron less likely to fire an action potential. An action potential is initiated when $V_m$ reaches the spike threshold, $V_{th}$. Therefore, an input is inhibitory if it drives $V_m$ away from $V_{th}$ or impedes its movement toward $V_{th}$.\n\nThe direction of the change in $V_m$ due to $I_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$ is given by the sign of $-I_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$. A hyperpolarizing effect (driving $V_m$ to more negative values) occurs when the GABA-mediated change in $V_m$ is negative. This requires $I_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$ to be positive.\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{GABA}} > 0\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the current, and knowing that conductance $g_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$ is always non-negative (and positive during activation), we get:\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{GABA}}(V_m - E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}) > 0 \\implies V_m - E_{\\mathrm{GABA}} > 0 \\implies V_m > E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}\n$$\nWhen $V_m > E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$, the driving force $(V_m - E_{\\mathrm{GABA}})$ is positive, resulting in an outward current ($I_{\\mathrm{GABA}} > 0$). This current hyperpolarizes the membrane, driving $V_m$ towards $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$. As long as $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$ is more negative than the spike threshold $V_{th}$, this effect will be inhibitory, as it moves the membrane potential away from threshold. This form of inhibition is called hyperpolarizing inhibition.\n\nEven if $V_m  E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$ (but $V_m$ is above the resting potential), the GABAergic input can be inhibitory through a mechanism called shunting inhibition. The increase in $g_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$ increases the total membrane conductance $g_{total}$, thereby decreasing the membrane's input resistance $R_{in} = 1/g_{total}$. According to Ohm's law for synaptic inputs ($\\Delta V = I_{syn} R_{in}$), a smaller input resistance means that any concurrent excitatory current will produce a smaller depolarization $\\Delta V$, making it harder to reach the spike threshold.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks for the condition related to the sign of the current and its immediate effect on $V_m$. The condition for the GABAergic current to be explicitly hyperpolarizing (outward) is $V_m > E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$. In a broader sense, the GABAergic synapse is considered inhibitory as long as its reversal potential $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$ is below the spike threshold $V_{th}$, because activation of the conductance will always tend to pull $V_m$ towards $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$ and away from $V_{th}$.\n\nThe second task is to apply these principles to a specific scenario. We are given:\n- Spike threshold, $V_{th} = -50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n- $GABA_A$ reversal potential, $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}} = -55\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n- The neuron's membrane potential is at threshold, so $V_m = -50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\nWe are asked to compute the $GABA_A$ driving force, which is defined as $(V_m - E_{\\mathrm{GABA}})$.\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\text{Driving Force} = V_m - E_{\\mathrm{GABA}} = (-50\\,\\mathrm{mV}) - (-55\\,\\mathrm{mV})\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Driving Force} = -50\\,\\mathrm{mV} + 55\\,\\mathrm{mV} = +5\\,\\mathrm{mV}\n$$\nThe driving force is $5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. To express this with four significant figures as requested, the value is $5.000\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\nSince the driving force is positive ($+5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$), the $GABA_A$ current $I_{\\mathrm{GABA}} = g_{\\mathrm{GABA}}(+5\\,\\mathrm{mV})$ will be positive (outward). This outward current will cause hyperpolarization, pulling the membrane potential $V_m$ from its current value of $-50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ towards the more negative reversal potential $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}} = -55\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. This action directly opposes the condition for spiking by moving the membrane potential away from the threshold. Therefore, at the spike threshold, the GABAergic input remains robustly inhibitory, acting to hyperpolarize the membrane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.000}$$", "id": "5007488"}, {"introduction": "Neuronal ion concentrations are not static; they are in a dynamic steady state, constantly challenged by synaptic activity.
