According to the quantal hypothesis provided, the amplitude of an excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), $A$, is given by:\n$$A = N q p$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of functional presynaptic release sites, $q$ is the quantal size (the postsynaptic response to a single vesicle), and $p$ is the probability of release from any given site in response to an action potential.\n\nFor the first presynaptic pulse in the paired-pulse protocol, the EPSC amplitude, $A_1$, is:\n$$A_1 = N q p$$\nwhere $p$ is the baseline probability of release.\n\nFor the second pulse, we must account for two competing short-term plasticity mechanisms:\n$1$. **Vesicle Depletion**: The problem states that replenishment is negligible. Therefore, sites that released a vesicle on the first pulse are unavailable for the second. The number of sites that released is $Np$. The number of available sites for the second pulse is $N - Np = N(1-p)$.\n$2$. **Facilitation**: Residual calcium from the first pulse increases the release probability for the second pulse. The problem defines a facilitation factor $\\phi$ as a multiplicative increase in release probability. Thus, the release probability at an available site during the second pulse, $p_2$, is $p_2 = p(1+\\phi)$.\n\nCombining these effects, the amplitude of the second EPSC, $A_2$, is the product of the number of available sites, the quantal size, and the facilitated release probability:\n$$A_2 = [N(1-p)] \\times q \\times [p(1+\\phi)] = Nqp(1-p)(1+\\phi)$$\n\nThe paired-pulse ratio, $PPR$, is defined as the ratio of the second amplitude to the first:\n$$PPR = \\frac{A_2}{A_1} = \\frac{Nqp(1-p)(1+\\phi)}{Nqp} = (1-p)(1+\\phi)$$\n\nFirst, we determine the baseline release probability, $p$, using the provided experimental data.
