The roles of AMPA, GABA-A, and GABA-B receptors, the concepts of reversal potentials, conductance, spike threshold, and shunting inhibition are all standard and fundamental in neuroscience. The numerical values are within physiologically plausible ranges. The phenomenon described—a depolarizing GABAergic potential that is functionally inhibitory—is a well-documented case known as shunting inhibition.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed.

The question is clear and unambiguous.\n3.  **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a rigorous analysis. It does not violate any of the validation criteria. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. I will proceed with a full derivation and analysis.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe steady-state membrane potential, $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$, of a neuron with multiple active conductances can be calculated using the parallel conductance model. At steady state, the sum of all ionic currents across the membrane is zero:\n$$\n\\sum_i I_i = 0\n$$\nEach current $I_i$ is given by $I_i = g_i (V_{\\mathrm{m}} - E_i)$, where $g_i$ is the conductance and $E_i$ is the reversal potential for that ion channel type.\n\nFor this problem, the total current is the sum of the leak, excitatory (AMPA), and inhibitory (GABA-A) currents:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{L}} + I_{\\mathrm{E}} + I_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}} = 0\n$$\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{L}}(V_{\\mathrm{m}} - E_{\\mathrm{L}}) + g_{\\mathrm{E}}(V_{\\mathrm{m}} - E_{\\mathrm{E}}) + g_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}}(V_{\\mathrm{m}} - E_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}}) = 0\n$$\nSolving for $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$ gives the weighted average of the reversal potentials, where the conductances are the weights:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{g_{\\mathrm{L}}E_{\\mathrm{L}} + g_{\\mathrm{E}}E_{\\mathrm{E}} + g_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}}E_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}}}{g_{\\mathrm{L}} + g_{\\mathrm{E}} + g_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}}}\n$$\n\nAn input is considered \"inhibitory\" if it makes the neuron less likely to reach its spike threshold, $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the relevant potentials:\n- Resting potential: $V_{\\mathrm{rest}} = E_{\\mathrm{L}} = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n- GABA-A reversal potential: $E_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}} = -55\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n- Spike threshold: $V_{\\mathrm{th}} = -50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n\nWe observe the relationship $V_{\\mathrm{rest}}  E_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}}  V_{\\mathrm{th}}$. This is the classic condition for depolarizing shunting inhibition. Activating GABA-A channels alone from rest would depolarize the cell from $-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ towards $-55\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, but this potential is still below the threshold of $-50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. With the parameters given, concurrent GABA-A and AMPA conductances yield a steady-state membrane potential below spike threshold, because the added conductance shunts current and its reversal potential lies below threshold, even though it is depolarizing relative to rest.**\n\nLet's calculate the steady-state membrane potential $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$ when all three conductances are active:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{(10\\,\\mathrm{nS})(-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}) + (5\\,\\mathrm{nS})(0\\,\\mathrm{mV}) + (25\\,\\mathrm{nS})(-55\\,\\mathrm{mV})}{10\\,\\mathrm{nS} + 5\\,\\mathrm{nS} + 25\\,\\mathrm{nS}}\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{-650 - 1375}{40} \\,\\mathrm{mV} = \\frac{-2025}{40} \\,\\mathrm{mV} = -50.625\\,\\mathrm{mV}\n$$\nThe calculated potential $V_{\\mathrm{m}} = -50.625\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ is below the spike threshold $V_{\\mathrm{th}} = -50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Without the GABA-A input, the potential would be:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{m, no GABA}} = \\frac{g_{\\mathrm{L}}E_{\\mathrm{L}} + g_{\\mathrm{E}}E_{\\mathrm{E}}}{g_{\\mathrm{L}} + g_{\\mathrm{E}}} = \\frac{(10\\,\\mathrm{nS})(-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}) + (5\\,\\mathrm{nS})(0\\,\\mathrm{mV})}{10\\,\\mathrm{nS} + 5\\,\\mathrm{nS}} = \\frac{-650}{15} \\,\\mathrm{mV} \\approx -43.33\\,\\mathrm{mV}\n$$\nThis is well above the threshold, so the AMPA input alone would cause the neuron to spike. The addition of the GABA-A conductance prevents the spike.\nThe reasoning provided is also sound:\n1.  The added conductance ($g_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}} = 25\\,\\mathrm{nS}$) is large and \"shunts\" (diverts) the excitatory current. This is reflected in the denominator of the $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$ equation.\n2.  The GABA-A reversal potential ($E_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}} = -55\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) is below the spike threshold ($V_{\\mathrm{th}} = -50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$), so it pulls the membrane potential towards a value that is sub-threshold.\n3.  It is depolarizing relative to rest ($E_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}} > E_{\\mathrm{L}}$).\nThe statement is quantitatively and conceptually correct.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. A depolarizing GABA-A response increases the excitatory driving force, thereby increasing the amplitude of the excitatory postsynaptic potential, so it is not inhibitory.**\n\nThe driving force for the excitatory AMPA current is $(V_{\\mathrm{m}} - E_{\\mathrm{E}})$. The reversal potential is $E_{\\mathrm{E}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. The resting potential is $E_{\\mathrm{L}} = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. A depolarizing GABA-A response moves the membrane potential $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$ from rest towards $E_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}} = -55\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. For any value of $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$ between $-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and $-55\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, the membrane potential is closer to $E_{\\mathrm{E}}=0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ than it was at rest. For example, at rest, the magnitude of the driving force is $|-65\\,\\mathrm{mV} - 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}| = 65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. After depolarization to $-60\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, the magnitude is $|-60\\,\\mathrm{mV} - 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}| = 60\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. The depolarization *decreases* the magnitude of the excitatory driving force, not increases it. A smaller driving force results in a smaller excitatory current for a given conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{E}}$.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Opening GABA-A channels reduces input resistance, so the same excitatory synaptic current produces a smaller voltage change, which can prevent threshold crossing despite depolarization.**\n\nInput resistance is the inverse of the total conductance: $R_{\\mathrm{in}} = 1/g_{\\mathrm{total}}$.\nInitially, at rest, $g_{\\mathrm{total}} = g_{\\mathrm{L}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nS}$.\nWhen GABA-A channels open, the total conductance increases: $g_{\\mathrm{total}}' = g_{\\mathrm{L}} + g_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}} (+ g_{\\mathrm{E}})$. For instance, with GABA-A and leak, $g_{\\mathrm{total}}' = 10+25 = 35\\,\\mathrm{nS}$. The increase in total conductance causes a decrease in input resistance.\nAccording to Ohm's Law in the context of a neuron, the change in membrane potential ($\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{m}}$) due to a synaptic current ($I_{\\mathrm{syn}}$) is approximated by $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{m}} = I_{\\mathrm{syn}} \\times R_{\\mathrm{in}}$.\nIf $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is reduced, the same excitatory synaptic current will produce a smaller $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{m}}$. This effect, known as shunting, makes it harder for the excitatory input to depolarize the neuron to its threshold. This statement correctly describes the core mechanism of shunting inhibition.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. Depolarizing GABA-B responses are inhibitory primarily because they open chloride channels whose reversal potential is above spike threshold.**\n\nThis statement contains multiple factual errors.\n1.  The problem states that GABA-B receptors activate \"G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels\", not chloride channels. GABA-A receptors activate chloride channels.\n2.  The response mediated by potassium channels is typically hyperpolarizing, not depolarizing, as the potassium reversal potential ($E_{\\mathrm{K}}$) is usually around $-90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, far below the resting potential of $-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. The premise \"Depolarizing GABA-B responses\" is therefore inconsistent with the standard mechanism described.\n3.  The reversal potential of the GABA-B mediated K+ current ($E_{\\mathrm{K}} \\approx -90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) is far *below*, not above, the spike threshold ($V_{\\mathrm{th}} = -50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$).\nThe statement conflates GABA-A and GABA-B mechanisms and is incorrect on every point.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Even when $E_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}} > E_{\\mathrm{L}}$, if $E_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}}  V_{\\mathrm{th}}$, GABA-A can be inhibitory by producing outward current at voltages near threshold and by decreasing the membrane time constant, thereby reducing temporal summation of coincident excitatory inputs.**\n\nThis statement proposes two mechanisms.\n1.  \"...producing outward current at voltages near threshold.\" The GABA-A current is $I_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}} = g_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}}(V_{\\mathrm{m}} - E_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}})$. Given $E_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}} = -55\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{th}} = -50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. If an excitatory input drives the membrane potential $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$ into the range above $-55\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ but below $-50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ (i.e., \"near threshold\"), the driving force $(V_{\\mathrm{m}} - E_{\\mathrm{GABA_A}})$ becomes positive. This results in an outward current (positive charge leaving the cell, or negative charge entering), which opposes further depolarization and pushes $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$ back towards $-55\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, away from the threshold. This is a correct description of the inhibitory action.\n2.  \"...decreasing the membrane time constant, thereby reducing temporal summation...\". The membrane time constant is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}} = R_{\\mathrm{in}} C_{\\mathrm{m}} = C_{\\mathrm{m}}/g_{\\mathrm{total}}$, where $C_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is the membrane capacitance. Opening GABA-A channels increases the total conductance $g_{\\mathrm{total}}$, which in turn decreases the time constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}$. A shorter time constant means that synaptic potentials decay more rapidly. Faster decay reduces the window for temporal summation, making it less likely that successive or coincident excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) will sum to reach threshold. This is also a correct description of an aspect of shunting inhibition.\nBoth mechanisms described in the statement are correct.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "5019315"}, {"introduction": "In contrast to the rapid, direct gating of GABA-A receptors, GABA-B receptors operate on a slower timescale via metabotropic G-protein signaling, with distinct roles at presynaptic and postsynaptic sites.

Proceeding to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe core mechanism to analyze is the action of Pertussis toxin ($\\text{PTX}$). The problem states that $\\text{PTX}$ prevents the coupling between $\\text{GABA}_\\text{B}$ receptors and their associated $G_{\\text{i/o}}$ proteins. This means that any signaling pathway downstream of $G_{\\text{i/o}}$ protein activation by $\\text{GABA}_\\text{B}$ receptors will be blocked. We must analyze the consequences of this blockage on the postsynaptic and presynaptic functions mediated by $\\text{GABA}_\\text{B}$ receptors.\n\n**1. Postsynaptic Effects of $\\text{PTX}$**\n\n*   **Normal Function:** Postsynaptically, $\\text{GABA}_\\text{B}$ receptor activation by $\\text{GABA}$ or an agonist like baclofen leads to the activation of a $G_{\\text{i/o}}$ protein. The dissociated $\\beta\\gamma$ subunits of the $G$ protein then directly bind to and open GIRK channels. Since the equilibrium potential for potassium ($E_K$) is more negative than the typical resting membrane potential, the opening of GIRK channels leads to an efflux of $K^{+}$ ions, causing a slow hyperpolarization of the membrane (the slow IPSP) and an increase in membrane conductance.\n*   **Effect of $\\text{PTX}$:** By preventing the coupling of $\\text{GABA}_\\text{B}$ receptors to $G_{\\text{i/o}}$ proteins, $\\text{PTX}$ abolishes this entire pathway. Agonist binding to the $\\text{GABA}_\\text{B}$ receptor will no longer lead to GIRK channel activation. Consequently, $\\text{PTX}$ treatment will eliminate the slow IPSP and the associated conductance increase normally produced by $\\text{GABA}_\\text{B}$ receptor activation.\n\n**2. Presynaptic Effects of $\\text{PTX}$**\n\n*   **Normal Function:** Presynaptically, $\\text{GABA}_\\text{B}$ receptors (acting as autoreceptors on $\\text{GABA}$ergic terminals or heteroreceptors on other terminals, such as glutamatergic ones) also couple to $G_{\\text{i/o}}$ proteins. Their activation inhibits voltage-gated $Ca^{2+}$ channels. This reduction in $Ca^{2+}$ influx into the presynaptic terminal upon arrival of an action potential decreases the probability of neurotransmitter release ($P_{release}$).\n*   **Paired-Pulse Ratio ($PPR$):** The $PPR$, defined as $EPSC_{2}/EPSC_{1}$, is inversely related to the initial probability of release ($P_{release,1}$). When $P_{release,1}$ is low (as it would be under $\\text{GABA}_\\text{B}$-mediated presynaptic inhibition), the synapse is more likely to exhibit paired-pulse facilitation ($PPR > 1$), because less vesicle depletion and/or residual $Ca^{2+}$ effects dominate. When $P_{release,1}$ is high, the synapse is more likely to exhibit paired-pulse depression ($PPR  1$), often due to vesicle pool depletion. Therefore, activation of presynaptic $\\text{GABA}_\\text{B}$ receptors decreases $P_{release,1}$ and thus *increases* the $PPR$.\n*   **Effect of $\\text{PTX}$:** $\\text{PTX}$ blocks the $G_{\\text{i/o}}$ signaling that mediates this presynaptic inhibition. As a result, $\\text{GABA}_\\text{B}$ receptors can no longer suppress $Ca^{2+}$ channel activity. This eliminates the presynaptic inhibition. The probability of transmitter release ($P_{release,1}$) will therefore be higher than it would be in the presence of $\\text{GABA}_\\text{B}$ activity. This increase in $P_{release,1}$ will lead to a *decrease* in the $PPR$ (i.e., a reduction of paired-pulse facilitation or an enhancement of paired-pulse depression).\n\n**3. Effects on $\\text{GABA}_\\text{A}$ Receptors**\n\n*   **Normal Function:** $\\text{GABA}_\\text{A}$ receptors are ionotropic receptors, meaning they are ligand-gated ion channels. Their function—gating a $Cl^{-}$conductance to produce a fast IPSP—is direct and does not involve G-proteins.\n*   **Effect of $\\text{PTX}$:** Since $\\text{PTX}$ is specific for $G_{\\text{i/o}}$ proteins, it has no known direct mechanism of action on ionotropic receptors like the $\\text{GABA}_\\text{A}$ receptor. Therefore, $\\text{PTX}$ is not expected to affect the fast IPSPs mediated by $\\text{GABA}_\\text{A}$ receptors.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. PTX abolishes the baclofen-induced slow hyperpolarization and its associated increase in membrane conductance because $\\text{GABA}_\\text{B}$–$G_{\\text{i/o}}$ coupling to GIRK channels is disrupted.**\nThis statement accurately describes the postsynaptic effect. Baclofen is a $\\text{GABA}_\\text{B}$ agonist. The slow hyperpolarization (slow IPSP) and conductance increase are due to GIRK channel activation via the $\\text{GABA}_\\text{B}$–$G_{\\text{i/o}}$ pathway. $\\text{PTX}$ disrupts this coupling, thereby abolishing the effect.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. PTX enhances presynaptic inhibition by $\\text{GABA}_\\text{B}$, further reducing $Ca^{2+}$ entry and transmitter release probability during the first pulse, thereby increasing $PPR$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. $\\text{PTX}$ *blocks* or *abolishes* $\\text{GABA}_\\text{B}$-mediated signaling; it does not enhance it. The predicted effects on $Ca^{2+}$ entry, release probability, and $PPR$ are the opposite of what would occur.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. PTX decreases $\\text{GABA}_\\text{B}$-mediated presynaptic inhibition, increasing glutamate release probability and reducing paired-pulse facilitation (i.e., lowers $PPR$ toward baseline).**\nThis statement accurately describes the presynaptic effect. By blocking presynaptic inhibition from $\\text{GABA}_\\text{B}$ receptors (which could be tonically active or activated by the experimental stimulation), $\\text{PTX}$ will cause an increase in the baseline probability of glutamate release. An increased release probability reduces paired-pulse facilitation, which is reflected as a lower $PPR$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. PTX does not affect fast IPSPs mediated by $\\text{GABA}_\\text{A}$ receptors.**\nThis statement is correct. The mechanism of action of $\\text{PTX}$ is specific to $G_{\\text{i/o}}$ proteins. $\\text{GABA}_\\text{A}$ receptors are ionotropic and do not use this signaling pathway. Therefore, their function should be unaffected by $\\text{PTX}$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. PTX converts the slow IPSP into a faster, larger $Cl^{-}$-dependent hyperpolarization by shifting receptor coupling from metabotropic to ionotropic signaling at $\\text{GABA}_\\text{B}$ receptors.**\nThis statement is scientifically unsound. $\\text{PTX}$ is an enzyme that chemically modifies a G-protein subunit. It does not possess the capability to fundamentally alter the structure and function of a receptor from metabotropic to ionotropic.

The program must produce numeric outputs for a small test suite of parameter conditions, following the exact final output format specified below.\n\nFundamental base and definitions:\n- Use Kirchhoff’s current law for a membrane capacitor of capacitance $C$ and voltage $V(t)$, so that\n$$\nC \\frac{dV}{dt} = - I_{\\mathrm{ion}}(V,m,h,n) - I_{\\mathrm{syn}}(V,t) + I_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t),\n$$\nwith $I_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t) = 0$ for all $t$.\n- The intrinsic ionic currents are Hodgkin–Huxley-type:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{ion}} = g_{\\mathrm{Na}} m^3 h (V - E_{\\mathrm{Na}}) + g_{\\mathrm{K}} n^4 (V - E_{\\mathrm{K}}) + g_{\\mathrm{L}} (V - E_{\\mathrm{L}}),\n$$\nwhere $m(t)$, $h(t)$, and $n(t)$ are gating variables satisfying first-order kinetics:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\alpha_x(V) (1 - x) - \\beta_x(V) \\, x, \\quad x \\in \\{m,h,n\\}.\n$$\nUse the classical voltage-dependent rate functions (with $V$ in millivolts):\n$$\n\\alpha_m(V) = \\frac{0.1 (V + 40)}{1 - e^{-(V+40)/10}}, \\quad \\beta_m(V) = 4 e^{-(V+65)/18},\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_h(V) = 0.07 e^{-(V+65)/20}, \\quad \\beta_h(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(V+35)/10}},\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_n(V) = \\frac{0.01 (V + 55)}{1 - e^{-(V+55)/10}}, \\quad \\beta_n(V) = 0.125 e^{-(V+65)/80}.\n$$\nParameters for the Hodgkin–Huxley model are:\n$$\nC = 1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu F/cm^2}, \\quad g_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 120\\,\\mathrm{mS/cm^2}, \\quad g_{\\mathrm{K}} = 36\\,\\mathrm{mS/cm^2}, \\quad g_{\\mathrm{L}} = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{mS/cm^2},\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 50\\,\\mathrm{mV}, \\quad E_{\\mathrm{K}} = -77\\,\\mathrm{mV}, \\quad E_{\\mathrm{L}} = -54.387\\,\\mathrm{mV}.\n$$\nInitial conditions at time $t = 0$ are $V(0) = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, and $m(0)$, $h(0)$, $n(0)$ are set to their steady-state values at $V = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, i.e., $x(0) = \\alpha_x(V)/(\\alpha_x(V) + \\beta_x(V))$.\n\nSynaptic conductances:\n- The excitatory synaptic conductance is a bi-exponential transient with onset time $t_E$, rise time constant $\\tau_{r,E}$, decay time constant $\\tau_{d,E}$, and reversal potential $E_{\\mathrm{exc}}$:\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{exc}}(t) = g^{\\max}_{\\mathrm{exc}} \\cdot s(t; t_E, \\tau_{r,E}, \\tau_{d,E}),\n$$\nwhere $s(t; t_0, \\tau_r, \\tau_d)$ is a normalized bi-exponential shape that is $0$ for $t  t_0$ and, for $t \\ge t_0$,\n$$\ns(t; t_0, \\tau_r, \\tau_d) = \\frac{e^{-(t-t_0)/\\tau_d} - e^{-(t-t_0)/\\tau_r}}{e^{-t_{\\mathrm{peak,rel}}/\\tau_d} - e^{-t_{\\mathrm{peak,rel}}/\\tau_r}},\n$$\nwith the relative-to-onset peak time\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{peak,rel}} = \\frac{\\tau_r \\tau_d}{\\tau_d - \\tau_r} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{\\tau_d}{\\tau_r}\\right),\n$$\nso that the peak of $s$ equals $1$.

Let the excitatory peak time be $t_{\\mathrm{peak},E} = t_E + t_{\\mathrm{peak,rel}}$ where $t_{\\mathrm{peak,rel}}$ uses $(\\tau_{r,E}, \\tau_{d,E})$. The inhibitory onset is defined relative to the excitatory peak by\n$$\nt_I = t_{\\mathrm{peak},E} + \\Delta t,\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta t$ is the timing offset (negative means inhibition starts before the EPSP peak, positive means after the peak).\n\nSynaptic currents:\n- The total synaptic current is\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{syn}}(V,t) = g_{\\mathrm{exc}}(t) (V - E_{\\mathrm{exc}}) + g_{\\mathrm{inh}}(t) (V - E_{\\mathrm{inh}}).\n$$\n\nTwo measured outcomes:\n1. EPSP integral: Define the baseline $V_{\\mathrm{base}}$ as the membrane potential at $t=0\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ under the current condition.

Express the EPSP integral in $\\mathrm{mV \\cdot ms}$, rounded to three decimals.\n2. Spike probability: Using the full Hodgkin–Huxley model (with nonzero $g_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ and $g_{\\mathrm{K}}$ as specified above), determine whether at least one action potential occurs in the window $[0, T]$, defining a spike as a threshold crossing of $V(t)$ from below $0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to above $0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.

Seed the random number generator deterministically so that results are reproducible.\n- The excitatory synapse parameters are $\\tau_{r,E} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, $\\tau_{d,E} = 5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, $E_{\\mathrm{exc}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, and $g^{\\max}_{\\mathrm{exc}} = 0.12\\,\\mathrm{mS/cm^2}$.\n- The inhibitory peaks are $g^{\\max}_{\\mathrm{inh}} = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{mS/cm^2}$ for GABA-A and $g^{\\max}_{\\mathrm{inh}} = 0.12\\,\\mathrm{mS/cm^2}$ for GABA-B.\n\nTest suite:\nCompute the EPSP integral and spike probability for the following five parameter cases. Each case is a pair $(\\mathrm{type}, \\Delta t)$ where $\\mathrm{type} \\in \\{\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{B}\\}$ denotes the receptor type and $\\Delta t$ is in $\\mathrm{ms}$:\n- Case $1$: $(\\mathrm{A}, -5)$\n- Case $2$: $(\\mathrm{A}, 0)$\n- Case $3$: $(\\mathrm{A}, 5)$\n- Case $4$: $(\\mathrm{B}, 0)$\n- Case $5$: $(\\mathrm{B}, -50)$\n\nRequired final output format:\n- Your program must produce a single line containing a list with $2$ numbers per case, in order of the cases $1$ through $5$: the EPSP integral in $\\mathrm{mV \\cdot ms}$ (rounded to three decimals) followed by the spike probability (rounded to three decimals). Concatenate these into a single flat list. For example, the output must look like\n$$\n[\\mathcal{I}_1, p_1, \\mathcal{I}_2, p_2, \\ldots, \\mathcal{I}_5, p_5],\n$$\nprinted as a Python-style list with comma-separated values on a single line, where each $\\mathcal{I}_k$ and $p_k$ is a numeric literal with three decimals.\n\nAngle units: There are no angles. Physical units: Express the EPSP integral in $\\mathrm{mV \\cdot ms}$ as specified. Spike probability must be a decimal fraction between $0$ and $1$.\n\nYour implementation must be a complete, runnable program that uses only the specified environment and libraries, and must not read input.", "solution": "The problem is valid. It presents a well-posed, scientifically grounded computational neurobiology task to investigate the functional impact of inhibitory synapse timing and type on neuronal signal integration and firing. The model is based on the canonical Hodgkin-Huxley formulation and standard bi-exponential models of synaptic conductances, with all parameters and conditions clearly specified.\n\nThe solution involves numerically integrating a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describe the neuron's membrane potential and ion channel dynamics. We will perform two types of simulations for each specified condition: a \"passive\" simulation to measure the subthreshold Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP) integral, and a series of \"active\" simulations with stochastic input to estimate the spike probability.\n\nThe model is defined by the following system of equations.\n\nThe membrane potential $V(t)$ evolves according to Kirchhoff's current law for the cell membrane:\n$$\nC \\frac{dV}{dt} = - I_{\\mathrm{ion}}(t) - I_{\\mathrm{syn}}(t)\n$$\nwhere $C = 1 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu F/cm^2}$ is the membrane capacitance, $I_{\\mathrm{ion}}$ is the sum of intrinsic ionic currents, and $I_{\\mathrm{syn}}$ is the sum of synaptic currents. All currents are expressed as densities in $\\mathrm{\\mu A/cm^2}$.\n\nThe intrinsic ionic currents, $I_{\\mathrm{ion}}$, are described by the Hodgkin-Huxley model:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{ion}} = g_{\\mathrm{Na}} m^3 h (V - E_{\\mathrm{Na}}) + g_{\\mathrm{K}} n^4 (V - E_{\\mathrm{K}}) + g_{\\mathrm{L}} (V - E_{\\mathrm{L}})\n$$\nHere, $g_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 120 \\ \\mathrm{mS/cm^2}$, $g_{\\mathrm{K}} = 36 \\ \\mathrm{mS/cm^2}$, and $g_{\\mathrm{L}} = 0.3 \\ \\mathrm{mS/cm^2}$ are the maximal conductances for sodium, potassium, and leak channels, respectively. The corresponding reversal potentials are $E_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 50 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$, $E_{\\mathrm{K}} = -77 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$, and $E_{\\mathrm{L}} = -54.387 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$. The variables $m$, $h$, and $n$ represent the gating probabilities for sodium activation, sodium inactivation, and potassium activation. Their dynamics are governed by first-order kinetics:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\alpha_x(V) (1 - x) - \\beta_x(V) x, \\quad x \\in \\{m, h, n\\}\n$$\nThe voltage-dependent rate functions $\\alpha_x(V)$ and $\\beta_x(V)$ (with $V$ in $\\mathrm{mV}$ and rates in $1/\\mathrm{ms}$) are given by:\n$$\n\\alpha_m(V) = \\frac{0.1 (V + 40)}{1 - e^{-(V+40)/10}}, \\quad \\beta_m(V) = 4 e^{-(V+65)/18}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_h(V) = 0.07 e^{-(V+65)/20}, \\quad \\beta_h(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(V+35)/10}}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_n(V) = \\frac{0.01 (V + 55)}{1 - e^{-(V+55)/10}}, \\quad \\beta_n(V) = 0.125 e^{-(V+65)/80}\n$$\nThe functions $\\alpha_m(V)$ and $\\alpha_n(V)$ have removable singularities at $V=-40 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$ and $V=-55 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$, respectively. By applying L'Hôpital's rule, we find the limits are $\\alpha_m(-40) = 1.0$ and $\\alpha_n(-55) = 0.1$, which must be handled in the numerical implementation.\n\nThe total synaptic current, $I_{\\mathrm{syn}}$, is the sum of an excitatory and an inhibitory component:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{syn}}(V,t) = g_{\\mathrm{exc}}(t) (V - E_{\\mathrm{exc}}) + g_{\\mathrm{inh}}(t) (V - E_{\\mathrm{inh}})\n$$\nBoth conductances are modeled as normalized bi-exponential functions:\n$$\ng(t) = g^{\\max} \\cdot s(t; t_0, \\tau_r, \\tau_d)\n$$\nwhere $t_0$ is the onset time, and $s(t)$ is a waveform that rises from $0$ to a peak of $1$ and then decays. For $t \\ge t_0$, it is given by:\n$$\ns(t; t_0, \\tau_r, \\tau_d) = \\frac{e^{-(t-t_0)/\\tau_d} - e^{-(t-t_0)/\\tau_r}}{e^{-t_{\\mathrm{peak,rel}}/\\tau_d} - e^{-t_{\\mathrm{peak,rel}}/\\tau_r}}, \\quad \\text{with} \\quad t_{\\mathrm{peak,rel}} = \\frac{\\tau_r \\tau_d}{\\tau_d - \\tau_r} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{\\tau_d}{\\tau_r}\\right)\n$$\nThe excitatory synapse has parameters $g^{\\max}_{\\mathrm{exc}} = 0.12 \\ \\mathrm{mS/cm^2}$, $E_{\\mathrm{exc}} = 0 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$, $t_E = 10 \\ \\mathrm{ms}$, $\\tau_{r,E} = 0.5 \\ \\mathrm{ms}$, and $\\tau_{d,E} = 5 \\ \\mathrm{ms}$. This yields a peak time for the excitatory conductance at $t_{\\mathrm{peak},E} \\approx 11.278 \\ \\mathrm{ms}$. The inhibitory conductance onset is $t_I = t_{\\mathrm{peak},E} + \\Delta t$, where $\\Delta t$ is varied. The parameters for GABA-A and GABA-B inhibition ($E_{\\mathrm{inh}}$, $\\tau_r$, $\\tau_d$, $g^{\\max}_{\\mathrm{inh}}$) are specified in the problem statement.\n\nThe system of four coupled ODEs (for $V, m, h, n$) is solved numerically using the forward Euler method with a time step of $dt = 0.01 \\ \\mathrm{ms}$ over a total duration of $T = 100 \\ \\mathrm{ms}$.\nThe update rule for a generic state variable $y$ is $y(t+dt) = y(t) + dt \\cdot \\frac{dy}{dt}$.\nInitial conditions at $t=0$ are $V(0) = -65 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$, with gating variables at their steady-state values for this voltage, i.e., $x(0) = \\alpha_x(-65) / (\\alpha_x(-65) + \\beta_x(-65))$.\n\nFor each experimental case, we compute two outcomes:\n1.  **EPSP Integral ($\\mathcal{I}$)**: We simulate the neuron in a \"passive\" mode by setting $g_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 0$ and $g_{\\mathrm{K}} = 0$. This isolates the subthreshold synaptic integration by removing the active, spike-generating conductances. The integral is calculated as the Riemann sum over the simulation window:\n    $$\n    \\mathcal{I} = \\int_0^T \\max\\left( V(t) - V_{\\mathrm{base}}, 0 \\right) \\, dt \\approx \\sum_{i=0}^{N_{\\text{steps}}-1} \\max(V(t_i) - V(0), 0) \\cdot dt\n    $$\n2.  **Spike Probability ($p$)**: We use the full Hodgkin-Huxley model ($g_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 120, g_{\\mathrm{K}} = 36$). To estimate a probability, we run $N=64$ trials. In each trial, the peak excitatory conductance is stochastically jittered: $g^{\\max}_{\\mathrm{exc,trial}} = g^{\\max}_{\\mathrm{exc}} \\cdot \\max(0, 1 + \\sigma \\xi)$, with $\\sigma = 0.05$ and $\\xi$ a standard normal random variate. A spike is detected if voltage crosses $0 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$ from below. The probability $p$ is the fraction of the $N$ trials that exhibit at least one spike. A deterministic seed is used for the random number generator to ensure reproducibility.\n\nThe implementation proceeds by first defining all model parameters and rate functions. A central simulation function integrates the ODEs for a given set of parameters. This function is called once for each EPSP integral calculation (in passive mode) and $N$ times for each spike probability estimation (in active mode with jittered input).
