Consider a simplified, well-mixed two-state cycle for the $G\\alpha$ subunit: the inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP; guanosine diphosphate)-bound state and the active guanosine triphosphate (GTP; guanosine triphosphate)-bound state.

It is therefore deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe kinetic scheme for the $G\\alpha$ subunit can be represented as a reversible first-order reaction cycle:\n$$ G\\alpha\\text{-GDP} \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{ex}}} G\\alpha\\text{-GTP} \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{hyd}}} G\\alpha\\text{-GDP} $$\nLet $[G\\alpha]_{\\text{GDP}}$ and $[G\\alpha]_{\\text{GTP}}$ denote the concentrations of the $GDP$-bound and $GTP$-bound states of $G\\alpha$, respectively. The rate of change of the concentration of $G\\alpha\\text{-GTP}$ is governed by the law of mass action:\n$$ \\frac{d[G\\alpha]_{\\text{GTP}}}{dt} = k_{\\text{ex}}[G\\alpha]_{\\text{GDP}} - k_{\\text{hyd}}[G\\alpha]_{\\text{GTP}} $$\nThe problem asks for the steady-state fractions. At steady state, the net rate of change for all species is zero. Therefore, we set $\\frac{d[G\\alpha]_{\\text{GTP}}}{dt} = 0$:\n$$ 0 = k_{\\text{ex}}[G\\alpha]_{\\text{GDP}} - k_{\\text{hyd}}[G\\alpha]_{\\text{GTP}} $$\nThis implies that the rate of formation of $G\\alpha\\text{-GTP}$ is equal to its rate of removal:\n$$ k_{\\text{ex}}[G\\alpha]_{\\text{GDP}} = k_{\\text{hyd}}[G\\alpha]_{\\text{GTP}} $$\nThe problem states that the total concentration of $G\\alpha$, denoted as $[G\\alpha]_{\\text{total}}$, is conserved. We can express this as:\n$$ [G\\alpha]_{\\text{GDP}} + [G\\alpha]_{\\text{GTP}} = [G\\alpha]_{\\text{total}} $$\nLet $f_{\\text{GTP}}$ be the fraction of $G\\alpha$ in the $GTP$-bound state, and $f_{\\text{GDP}}$ be the fraction in the $GDP$-bound state. These are defined as:\n$$ f_{\\text{GTP}} = \\frac{[G\\alpha]_{\\text{GTP}}}{[G\\alpha]_{\\text{total}}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f_{\\text{GDP}} = \\frac{[G\\alpha]_{\\text{GDP}}}{[G\\alpha]_{\\text{total}}} $$\nFrom the conservation law, it is given that $f_{\\text{GDP}} + f_{\\text{GTP}} = 1$, which implies $f_{\\text{GDP}} = 1 - f_{\\text{GTP}}$.\n\nWe can rewrite the steady-state equation in terms of fractions by dividing by $[G\\alpha]_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$ k_{\\text{ex}}f_{\\text{GDP}} = k_{\\text{hyd}}f_{\\text{GTP}} $$\nSubstitute the expression for $f_{\\text{GDP}}$ from the conservation law:\n$$ k_{\\text{ex}}(1 - f_{\\text{GTP}}) = k_{\\text{hyd}}f_{\\text{GTP}} $$\nNow, we solve for $f_{\\text{GTP}}$:\n$$ k_{\\text{ex}} - k_{\\text{ex}}f_{\\text{GTP}} = k_{\\text{hyd}}f_{\\text{GTP}} $$\n$$ k_{\\text{ex}} = f_{\\text{GTP}}(k_{\\text{ex}} + k_{\\text{hyd}}) $$\n$$ f_{\\text{GTP}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{ex}}}{k_{\\text{ex}} + k_{\\text{hyd}}} $$\nThis is the general expression for the steady-state fraction of $G\\alpha$ in the active, $GTP$-bound state.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $k_{\\text{ex}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $k_{\\text{hyd}} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$$ f_{\\text{GTP}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.1} = \\frac{1}{1.1} $$\nCalculating the decimal value:\n$$ f_{\\text{GTP}} \\approx 0.909090... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $f_{\\text{GTP}} = 0.9091$.\n\nNext, we determine the steady-state fraction of free $G\\beta\\gamma$. The problem states that $G\\beta\\gamma$ is free when $G\\alpha$ is bound to $GTP$, with $1{:}1$ stoichiometry. This means that for every molecule of $G\\alpha\\text{-GTP}$, there is one free $G\\beta\\gamma$ dimer. Let $[G\\beta\\gamma]_{\\text{free}}$ be the concentration of free $G\\beta\\gamma$. The stoichiometric relationship is:\n$$ [G\\beta\\gamma]_{\\text{free}} = [G\\alpha]_{\\text{GTP}} $$\nThe total concentration of $G\\beta\\gamma$, $[G\\beta\\gamma]_{\\text{total}}$, is equal to the total concentration of $G\\alpha$, $[G\\alpha]_{\\text{total}}$, because they form a heterotrimer. The fraction of free $G\\beta\\gamma$, denoted as $f_{G\\beta\\gamma, \\text{free}}$, is therefore:\n$$ f_{G\\beta\\gamma, \\text{free}} = \\frac{[G\\beta\\gamma]_{\\text{free}}}{[G\\beta\\gamma]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[G\\alpha]_{\\text{GTP}}}{[G\\alpha]_{\\text{total}}} = f_{\\text{GTP}} $$\nThus, the steady-state fraction of free $G\\beta\\gamma$ is equal to the steady-state fraction of $G\\alpha\\text{-GTP}$.\n$$ f_{G\\beta\\gamma, \\text{free}} = f_{\\text{GTP}} \\approx 0.909090... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $f_{G\\beta\\gamma, \\text{free}} = 0.9091$.\n\nThe two requested quantities are the steady-state fraction of $G\\alpha$ in the $GTP$-bound state, which is $0.9091$, and the steady-state fraction of free $G\\beta\\gamma$, which is also $0.9091$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.9091 & 0.9091 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "5018972"}, {"introduction": "While steady-state analysis provides a baseline, real biological signals are dynamic events with a distinct start and end.

Let the total AC concentration be $[AC]=100\\,\\text{nM}$, the catalytic turnover be $k_{\\text{AC}}=50\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, and the PDE rate constant be $k_{\\text{PDE}}=5\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$. Suppose $[G\\alpha_s\\text{-GTP}]$ steps from $0\\,\\text{nM}$ to $50\\,\\text{nM}$ at time $t=0$ and remains at $50\\,\\text{nM}$ for $2\\,\\text{s}$ before returning to $0\\,\\text{nM}$, and the baseline $[cAMP]$ at $t=0$ is $0\\,\\text{nM}$. Under these assumptions, determine the peak $[cAMP]$ generated by this $2\\,\\text{s}$ $G\\alpha_s\\text{-GTP}$ step. Express your final answer in nanomolar (nM) and round to six significant figures.", "solution": "The problem presents a well-posed kinetic model of a simplified signal transduction cascade, grounded in established principles of neurobiology and enzyme kinetics. All necessary parameters and initial conditions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or scientific inaccuracies. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, denoted as $[cAMP](t)$, is governed by the balance between its enzymatic production by adenylyl cyclase (AC) and its degradation by phosphodiesterase (PDE). We can express this relationship as a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\frac{d[cAMP]}{dt} = \\text{Rate}_{\\text{production}} - \\text{Rate}_{\\text{degradation}}\n$$\nLet $C(t) = [cAMP](t)$.\n\nThe rate of production is determined by the concentration of activated AC, $[AC]_{\\text{act}}$, and the catalytic turnover number, $k_{\\text{AC}}$. The problem states this relationship is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate}_{\\text{production}} = k_{\\text{AC}} [AC]_{\\text{act}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the concentration of activated AC is the lesser of the total AC concentration, $[AC]$, and the instantaneous concentration of the G-protein's alpha subunit, $[G\\alpha_s\\text{-GTP}]$.\n$$\n[AC]_{\\text{act}} = \\min([AC], [G\\alpha_s\\text{-GTP}])\n$$\nThe degradation of cAMP is described as a first-order process with a rate constant $k_{\\text{PDE}}$.\n$$\n\\text{Rate}_{\\text{degradation}} = k_{\\text{PDE}} [cAMP] = k_{\\text{PDE}} C(t)\n$$\nCombining these terms, the governing ODE is:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = k_{\\text{AC}} \\min([AC], [G\\alpha_s\\text{-GTP}]) - k_{\\text{PDE}} C(t)\n$$\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n- Total AC concentration: $[AC] = 100\\,\\text{nM}$\n- Catalytic turnover: $k_{\\text{AC}} = 50\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- PDE rate constant: $k_{\\text{PDE}} = 5\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- Initial condition: $C(0) = 0\\,\\text{nM}$\n\nThe problem describes a step input for $[G\\alpha_s\\text{-GTP}]$. For the time interval $0 \\le t \\le 2\\,\\text{s}$:\n$$\n[G\\alpha_s\\text{-GTP}] = 50\\,\\text{nM}\n$$\nDuring this interval, the concentration of activated AC is:\n$$\n[AC]_{\\text{act}} = \\min(100\\,\\text{nM}, 50\\,\\text{nM}) = 50\\,\\text{nM}\n$$\nThe production rate is therefore constant for $0 \\le t \\le 2\\,\\text{s}$:\n$$\n\\text{Rate}_{\\text{production}} = (50\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (50\\,\\text{nM}) = 2500\\,\\text{nM}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nLet's denote this constant production rate as $V_0$. The ODE for the interval $0 \\le t \\le 2\\,\\text{s}$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = V_0 - k_{\\text{PDE}} C(t)\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values for $V_0$ and $k_{\\text{PDE}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = 2500 - 5 C(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ODE with constant coefficients. We can rearrange it to the standard form:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} + 5 C(t) = 2500\n$$\nThe general solution to this type of equation is $C(t) = C_{ss} + (C(0) - C_{ss})\\exp(-k_{\\text{PDE}}t)$, where $C_{ss}$ is the steady-state concentration that would be achieved if the stimulus were maintained indefinitely. The steady-state is found by setting $\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0$:\n$$\n0 = V_0 - k_{\\text{PDE}} C_{ss} \\implies C_{ss} = \\frac{V_0}{k_{\\text{PDE}}}\n$$\n$$\nC_{ss} = \\frac{2500\\,\\text{nM}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}{5\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = 500\\,\\text{nM}\n$$\nUsing the initial condition $C(0) = 0$, the solution for $0 \\le t \\le 2\\,\\text{s}$ is:\n$$\nC(t) = 500(1 - \\exp(-5t))\n$$\nThe problem asks for the peak concentration of cAMP. To find the time of the peak, we analyze the behavior of $C(t)$. The time derivative of $C(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = 500(5\\exp(-5t)) = 2500\\exp(-5t)\n$$\nSince $\\exp(-5t) > 0$ for all $t$, the derivative $\\frac{dC(t)}{dt}$ is always positive for $0 \\le t \\le 2\\,\\text{s}$. This indicates that $C(t)$ is a strictly increasing function during the stimulus period.\n\nAt $t=2\\,\\text{s}$, the stimulus $[G\\alpha_s\\text{-GTP}]$ returns to $0\\,\\text{nM}$. For $t > 2\\,\\text{s}$, the production rate term becomes $0$, as $[AC]_{\\text{act}} = \\min(100\\,\\text{nM}, 0\\,\\text{nM}) = 0$. The ODE simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -k_{\\text{PDE}} C(t) = -5 C(t)\n$$\nThis describes an exponential decay from the concentration reached at $t=2\\,\\text{s}$. Since the concentration increases until $t=2\\,\\text{s}$ and decreases thereafter, the peak concentration occurs precisely at $t=2\\,\\text{s}$.\n\nTo find the peak concentration, we evaluate $C(t)$ at $t=2\\,\\text{s}$:\n$$\nC_{\\text{peak}} = C(2) = 500(1 - \\exp(-5 \\times 2)) = 500(1 - \\exp(-10))\n$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value and round to six significant figures as requested.\n$$\n\\exp(-10) \\approx 0.00004539992976\n$$\n$$\nC_{\\text{peak}} \\approx 500(1 - 0.00004539992976) = 500(0.99995460007024)\n$$\n$$\nC_{\\text{peak}} \\approx 499.97730003511875\\,\\text{nM}\n$$\nRounding to six significant figures gives $499.977$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{499.977}\n$$", "id": "5018976"}]}
