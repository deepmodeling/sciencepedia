The problem requires the calculation of two quantities: fractional receptor occupancy and normalized tissue response, based on the law of mass action and the Black–Leff operational model.\n\n**1. Calculation of Fractional Receptor Occupancy ($p_A$)**\n\nThe fractional occupancy of a receptor by a ligand is a direct consequence of the law of mass action applied to the reversible binding equilibrium. Let $[L]$ be the concentration of the ligand (substance P), $[R]$ be the concentration of free receptors, and $[LR]$ be the concentration of the ligand-receptor complex. The binding reaction is:\n$$ L + R \\rightleftharpoons LR $$\nThe dissociation constant, $K_D$, is defined at equilibrium as:\n$$ K_D = \\frac{[L][R]}{[LR]} $$\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R_T]$, is the sum of free and bound receptors:\n$$ [R_T] = [R] + [LR] $$\nFractional receptor occupancy, which we shall denote as $p_A$, is the fraction of total receptors that are bound by the ligand:\n$$ p_A = \\frac{[LR]}{[R_T]} $$\nTo express $p_A$ in terms of the known quantities $[L]$ and $K_D$, we first rearrange the total receptor equation to solve for $[R]$:\n$$ [R] = [R_T] - [LR] $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $K_D$:\n$$ K_D = \\frac{[L]([R_T] - [LR])}{[LR]} $$\nWe then solve for the ratio $[LR]/[R_T]$:\n$$ K_D [LR] = [L][R_T] - [L][LR] $$\n$$ K_D [LR] + [L][LR] = [L][R_T] $$\n$$ [LR](K_D + [L]) = [L][R_T] $$\n$$ \\frac{[LR]}{[R_T]} = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_D} $$\nThus, the equation for fractional occupancy is:\n$$ p_A = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_D} $$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Agonist concentration, $[L] = 25\\,\\text{nM}$\n- Dissociation constant, $K_D = 15\\,\\text{nM}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $p_A$:\n$$ p_A = \\frac{25}{25 + 15} = \\frac{25}{40} = \\frac{5}{8} $$\nThe fractional receptor occupancy is $\\frac{5}{8}$.\n\n**2. Calculation of Normalized Response ($E/E_{\\max}$)**\n\nThe problem specifies the use of the Black–Leff operational model to relate receptor occupancy to tissue response. This model separates the process into two stages: agonist binding and signal transduction. The response, $E$, is a function of a stimulus, $S$, which in turn is generated by the occupied receptors.\n\nThe stimulus, $S$, is modeled as being proportional to the concentration of occupied receptors, incorporating the efficacy/coupling parameter $\\tau$:\n$$ S = \\tau \\cdot p_A $$\nThe parameter $\\tau$ is a dimensionless quantity that combines the intrinsic efficacy of the agonist with tissue-specific properties like total receptor density and transducer efficiency.\n\nThe problem states that the transducer slope parameter is $1$. In the context of operational models, this implies a simple, non-cooperative relationship between the stimulus and the response. The most common function describing such a relationship is hyperbolic, analogous to the Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{S}{K_E + S} $$\nwhere $E_{\\max}$ is the maximal possible response of the tissue and $K_E$ is the stimulus required to produce a half-maximal response. In the standard formulation of the operational model, the constant $K_E$ is incorporated into the definition of $\\tau$, leading to a simplified and normalized stimulus-response relationship:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{S}{1 + S} $$\nSubstituting the expression for the stimulus, $S = \\tau \\cdot p_A$:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{\\tau \\cdot p_A}{1 + \\tau \\cdot p_A} $$\nThis is the governing equation for the normalized response under the specified assumptions.\n\nThe problem provides the efficacy parameter $\\tau = 2.0$, and we have calculated the fractional occupancy $p_A = \\frac{5}{8}$. Substituting these values:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot \\frac{5}{8}}{1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{5}{8}} $$\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{\\frac{10}{8}}{1 + \\frac{10}{8}} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{4}}{1 + \\frac{5}{4}} $$\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{4}}{\\frac{4}{4} + \\frac{5}{4}} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{4}}{\\frac{9}{4}} $$\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{5}{9} $$\nThe predicted normalized response is $\\frac{5}{9}$ of the maximal response.\n\nThe final answer, presented as a row matrix of (occupancy, normalized response), consists of the two exact fractions computed above.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{5}{8} & \\frac{5}{9} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "5044260"}, {"introduction": "Neuropeptides often act by altering the fundamental properties of synaptic transmission, rather than by mediating it directly.

It is deemed a valid problem. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe problem requires us to derive the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) based on a binomial model of synaptic release and then calculate its change under specified conditions. The PPR is the ratio of the expected amplitude of the second excitatory postsynaptic current ($E[\\text{EPSC}_2]$) to the first ($E[\\text{EPSC}_1]$).\n\nLet $N$ be the number of independent release sites in the readily releasable pool.\nLet $q$ be the constant quantal size.\nLet $p$ be the release probability for a single site in response to the first action potential.\n\n**1. Expected Amplitude of the First EPSC ($E[\\text{EPSC}_1]$)**\nThe number of vesicles released by the first pulse, $k_1$, follows a binomial distribution, $k_1 \\sim B(N, p)$.\nThe expected number of released vesicles is the mean of this distribution:\n$$E[k_1] = Np$$\nThe expected amplitude of the first EPSC is given by the product of the expected number of quanta and the quantal size:\n$$E[\\text{EPSC}_1] = q \\cdot E[k_1] = qNp$$\n\n**2. Expected Amplitude of the Second EPSC ($E[\\text{EPSC}_2]$)**\nThe second pulse arrives at a short interval where vesicle replenishment is negligible. Therefore, only sites that did not release a vesicle on the first pulse are available to release on the second pulse.\nFor a single site, the probability of not releasing on the first pulse is $(1-p)$.\nThe release probability for an available site during the second pulse is increased by a facilitation increment $f$, becoming $p+f$.\n\nTo find the expected number of vesicles released by the second pulse, $E[k_2]$, we can consider the probability of a single site releasing a vesicle in response to the second pulse. This event requires two conditions to be met:\ni. The site did not release on the first pulse (probability $1-p$).\nii. The site, being available, releases on the second pulse (conditional probability $p+f$).\n\nSince the sites are independent, the unconditional probability for any given site to release on the second pulse, $P(\\text{release}_2)$, is the product of these probabilities:\n$$P(\\text{release}_2) = P(\\text{release}_2 | \\text{no release}_1) \\times P(\\text{no release}_1) = (p+f)(1-p)$$\nThe total number of vesicles released on the second pulse, $k_2$, is the sum of releases over all $N$ sites. By linearity of expectation, the expected number of released vesicles is:\n$$E[k_2] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} P(\\text{release}_{2,i}) = N(p+f)(1-p)$$\nThe expected amplitude of the second EPSC is therefore:\n$$E[\\text{EPSC}_2] = q \\cdot E[k_2] = qN(1-p)(p+f)$$\n\n**3. General Expression for Paired-Pulse Ratio (PPR)**\nThe PPR is the ratio of the expected amplitudes:\n$$\\mathrm{PPR} = \\frac{E[\\text{EPSC}_2]}{E[\\text{EPSC}_1]} = \\frac{qN(1-p)(p+f)}{qNp}$$\nThe terms $q$ and $N$ cancel, yielding the general expression for PPR as a function of $p$ and $f$:\n$$\\mathrm{PPR}(p, f) = \\frac{(1-p)(p+f)}{p}$$\n\n**4. Calculation of Change in PPR ($\\Delta \\mathrm{PPR}$)**\nWe now compute the PPR for the two conditions, holding $f=0.2$ constant.\n\n**a) Baseline PPR ($\\mathrm{PPR}_{\\text{baseline}}$)**\nUnder baseline conditions, the release probability is $p = 0.5$.\n$$\\mathrm{PPR}_{\\text{baseline}} = \\mathrm{PPR}(0.5, 0.2) = \\frac{(1-0.5)(0.5+0.2)}{0.5}$$\n$$\\mathrm{PPR}_{\\text{baseline}} = \\frac{(0.5)(0.7)}{0.5} = 0.7$$\n\n**b) Peptide-Modulated PPR ($\\mathrm{PPR}_{\\text{peptide}}$)**\nWhen the neuropeptide is applied, the release probability is reduced to $p = 0.25$.\n$$\\mathrm{PPR}_{\\text{peptide}} = \\mathrm{PPR}(0.25, 0.2) = \\frac{(1-0.25)(0.25+0.2)}{0.25}$$\n$$\\mathrm{PPR}_{\\text{peptide}} = \\frac{(0.75)(0.45)}{0.25}$$\nSince $\\frac{0.75}{0.25} = 3$, we have:\n$$\\mathrm{PPR}_{\\text{peptide}} = 3 \\times 0.45 = 1.35$$\n\n**c) Change in PPR ($\\Delta \\mathrm{PPR}$)**\nThe change in PPR is defined as $\\Delta \\mathrm{PPR} = \\mathrm{PPR}_{\\text{peptide}} - \\mathrm{PPR}_{\\text{baseline}}$.\n$$\\Delta \\mathrm{PPR} = 1.35 - 0.7$$\n$$\\Delta \\mathrm{PPR} = 0.65$$\nThe reduction in presynaptic release probability from $0.5$ to $0.25$ leads to an increase in the paired-pulse ratio from $0.7$ (paired-pulse depression) to $1.35$ (paired-pulse facilitation), resulting in a net change of $0.65$.

An experimental manipulation uniformly doubles extracellular peptidase activity.\n9.  The manipulation does not alter transporter function, receptor properties, or vesicle release machinery.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated based on the established validation criteria.\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem describes a classic scenario of neurotransmitter and neuromodulator co-release, which is a fundamental concept in neurobiology. The roles of glutamate as a fast transmitter, NPY as a slow modulator, their respective release mechanisms (activity-dependent LDCV release for NPY), their receptor targets (ionotropic for fast EPSCs, GPCRs for modulation), and their distinct clearance mechanisms (transporters for glutamate, enzymatic degradation for peptides) are all well-established scientific facts. The specific action of NPY on presynaptic $Y_2$ autoreceptors to inhibit release is a documented feedback mechanism. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem presents a clear initial system, a well-defined perturbation (doubled peptidase activity), and a specific question about the qualitative consequences. The constraints (no change to other system components) are explicit, allowing for a focused and logical deduction of the outcome. A unique qualitative prediction is possible.\n-   **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem statement does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, missing information, contradiction, or infeasibility.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. Proceeding to the solution.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the consequences of doubling the activity of extracellular peptidases. According to the problem statement, these peptidases are responsible for the inactivation of extracellular peptides, including Neuropeptide Y (NPY).\n\n1.  **Effect on NPY Lifetime and Concentration:** The rate of inactivation of a substance is proportional to the concentration of the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction. By doubling the extracellular peptidase activity, the rate of NPY degradation is effectively doubled.\n    Let C be the concentration of NPY and k be the rate constant for its degradation. The rate of change of NPY concentration due to peptidase activity is given by $\\frac{dC}{dt} = -k \\times [\\text{Peptidase}] \\times C$. If peptidase activity doubles, the new rate constant $k'$ becomes $2k$. Thus, NPY is cleared from the extracellular space more rapidly. This means both the peak concentration achieved after release will be lower and the duration for which the concentration remains above its effective threshold will be shorter.\n\n2.  **Effect on NPY Spatial Reach:** NPY acts as a volume transmitter, diffusing away from its release site to act on receptors extrasynaptically, over distances of \"tens of micrometers\". The characteristic distance ($\\lambda$) a molecule can diffuse before being eliminated is related to the diffusion coefficient ($D$) and the time constant of its removal ($\\tau$). This relationship can be approximated by $\\lambda \\approx \\sqrt{D\\tau}$. The time constant of removal is inversely proportional to the rate of degradation. Since the degradation rate is doubled, the time constant $\\tau$ is halved. Consequently, the spatial reach $\\lambda$ will decrease by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$. This means NPY will be effective over a smaller volume of tissue surrounding the release site.\n\n3.  **Effect on Synaptic Modulation:** NPY mediates presynaptic inhibition by acting on $Y_2$ receptors, reducing Ca$^{2+}$ influx and thus glutamate release probability. This is an activity-dependent process, becoming significant during \"sustained high-frequency activity\" when NPY is released.\n    -   Because the manipulation reduces the concentration, duration, and spatial reach of NPY, the activation of presynaptic $Y_2$ receptors will be reduced.\n    -   This leads to weaker presynaptic inhibition. During a high-frequency burst of action potentials, the build-up of NPY-mediated inhibition will be less pronounced than in the control condition.\n    -   Therefore, glutamate release will be less depressed during such bursts.\n\n4.  **Effect on Basal Glutamatergic Transmission:** The problem asks about the effect on the fast EPSC evoked by a single stimulus.\n    -   A single stimulus is generally insufficient to trigger significant release from LDCVs. Therefore, under basal single-stimulus conditions, there is little to no NPY present to exert any modulatory effect.\n    -   Furthermore, the problem explicitly states that the \"vesicle release machinery\", \"receptor properties\" (implying glutamate receptors), and \"transporter function\" (for glutamate clearance) are unaltered.\n    -   Thus, the fundamental properties of fast glutamatergic transmission elicited by a single action potential—the amplitude and kinetics of the EPSC—should remain unchanged.\n\n**Summary of Predictions:** The experimental manipulation causes NPY to be degraded more quickly. This results in NPY signals that are shorter in duration and more spatially confined. The functional consequence is a reduction in the activity-dependent presynaptic inhibition mediated by NPY. Basal, single-event glutamatergic transmission is unaffected.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Neuropeptide Y signaling will have a shorter duration and smaller spatial reach, leading to weaker presynaptic inhibition of glutamate release during high-frequency bursts, with minimal effect on the amplitude and kinetics of the fast glutamatergic EPSC evoked by a single stimulus.**\n-   This statement accurately captures all the deductions made from first principles. Faster degradation leads to shorter duration and smaller spatial reach for NPY. This reduces the activation of presynaptic $Y_2$ autoreceptors, resulting in weaker inhibition of glutamate release during the high-frequency activity that causes NPY release. The statement also correctly points out that basal transmission from a single stimulus, which does not typically involve NPY release, will be minimally affected, consistent with the problem's constraints.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Neuropeptide Y signaling will be enhanced because peptide fragments produced by increased peptidase activity act as more potent agonists at $Y_2$ receptors, resulting in stronger and more prolonged depression of excitatory transmission.**\n-   The premise of this option—that peptide fragments are more potent agonists—is an unsupported and speculative assertion. The problem states that peptidases \"inactivate\" the peptides, which implies loss of function. While exceptions exist in pharmacology, inactivation is the default and expected outcome. This option introduces a mechanism that contradicts the information given. The conclusion of \"stronger and more prolonged depression\" is the opposite of the logical outcome of increased inactivation.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Peptidergic modulation will be unchanged because peptides are protected within the synaptic cleft, whereas glutamate is more susceptible to extracellular enzymatic degradation.**\n-   This option contains multiple factual errors relative to the problem statement. First, it claims peptides are \"protected within the synaptic cleft,\" which contradicts the given information that NPY acts extrasynaptically over tens of micrometers. Second, it claims glutamate is \"more susceptible to extracellular enzymatic degradation,\" whereas the problem specifies its clearance is via transporters (EAATs), not enzymes. The conclusion that peptidergic modulation is unchanged is incorrect because the manipulation directly targets the peptide inactivation mechanism.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Glutamate clearance will slow due to competition between peptidases and glutamate transporters for extracellular space, prolonging ionotropic receptor activation, while peptidergic effects remain essentially unchanged.**\n-   This option makes two incorrect claims. First, it invokes a \"competition for extracellular space\" between peptidases and transporters, a speculative mechanism with no basis in established cell biology, and it directly contradicts the given constraint that \"transporter function\" is not altered. Second, it concludes that \"peptidergic effects remain essentially unchanged,\" which is fundamentally wrong, as the manipulation is a direct doubling of the activity of the enzyme that inactivates the peptide.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5044301"}]}
