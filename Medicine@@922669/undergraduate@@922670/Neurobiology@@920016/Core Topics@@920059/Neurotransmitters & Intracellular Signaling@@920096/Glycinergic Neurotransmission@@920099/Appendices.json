We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for the inhibitory postsynaptic current, $I(t)$, its peak amplitude, and the total charge transfer, $Q$. We begin with the application of Ohm's law to ion channels, which states that the current is the product of the conductance and the driving force.\n\nThe driving force for an ion is the difference between the membrane potential, $V_m$, and the equilibrium potential (or reversal potential) for that ion, $E_{\\text{ion}}$. For the glycine receptor, which is a chloride channel, the reversal potential is the chloride equilibrium potential, $E_{\\text{Cl}}$. Thus, the driving force is $(V_m - E_{\\text{Cl}})$.\n\nThe current, $I(t)$, flowing through the population of glycine receptors is given by:\n$$I(t) = g(t) (V_m - E_{\\text{Cl}})$$\nwhere $g(t)$ is the time-dependent conductance of the channels. The problem provides the functional form for the conductance transient:\n$$g(t) = g_{\\text{max}} \\exp(-t/\\tau_{s})$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for the current gives the full expression for the inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) as a function of time:\n$$I(t) = g_{\\text{max}} \\exp(-t/\\tau_{s}) (V_m - E_{\\text{Cl}})$$\nThis is the general expression for $I(t)$ in terms of the given parameters. The problem specifies a sign convention where positive current denotes outward conventional current (net flow of positive charge out of the cell). Let's evaluate the sign of the driving force with the given parameters: $V_m = -60\\,\\text{mV}$ and $E_{\\text{Cl}} = -75\\,\\text{mV}$.\n$$V_m - E_{\\text{Cl}} = (-60\\,\\text{mV}) - (-75\\,\\text{mV}) = +15\\,\\text{mV}$$\nSince the driving force is positive and the conductance $g(t)$ is always positive, the resulting current $I(t)$ will be positive. A positive current corresponds to an outward flow of positive charge. Since the charge carriers are negative chloride ions ($\\text{Cl}^-$), a positive driving force on $\\text{Cl}^-$ causes an influx of these ions, which is electrically equivalent to an outward conventional current.

Strychnine at the stated concentration does not block GABA type A receptors.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is a standard exercise in synaptic physiology and pharmacology.\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The entire setup describes a classic experimental paradigm used to study inhibitory synaptic transmission. Voltage-clamping, the use of TTX to isolate miniature synaptic events, and the use of a specific antagonist (strychnine) to identify the neurotransmitter system (glycinergic) are all fundamental, well-established techniques. The provided values for membrane potential ($V_{\\mathrm{hold}} = -70 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$) and reversal potential ($E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = -50 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$) are physiologically realistic. At this holding potential, the driving force on chloride ions ($V_{\\mathrm{hold}} - E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = -20 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$) will cause an influx of $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$, which by convention is an outward current (of positive charge), and is measurable. The concentrations of TTX and strychnine are appropriate for their described effects. The background facts are cornerstones of neurobiology. The problem does not violate any scientific principles.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem asks to identify which statements correctly describe the experimental logic and interpretation. Based on the provided setup and established principles, there is a definite set of correct and incorrect statements. The question is structured to have a unique, stable, and meaningful solution.\n-   **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology. Terms such as mIPSC, presynaptic mechanis, postsynaptic mechanism, antagonist, and quantal hypothesis have rigorous, universally accepted definitions in the field.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is valid. The solution will proceed by analyzing the foundational principles and then evaluating each option.\n\n### Foundational Principles\nThe experiment is designed to isolate and characterize glycinergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs).\n1.  **Isolation of mIPSCs:** Synaptic release can be action potential (AP)-dependent or AP-independent. Spontaneous release that occurs without an AP is the source of \"miniature\" events. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a specific blocker of voltage-gated sodium channels, which are essential for AP propagation. By applying TTX, all AP-dependent release is eliminated, isolating the AP-independent mIPSCs.\n2.  **Pharmacological Identification:** Spinal cord neurons can receive both glycinergic and GABAergic inhibitory inputs. Both are mediated by chloride channels. To confirm that the recorded mIPSCs are glycinergic, a specific antagonist is used. Strychnine is a classic antagonist of glycine receptors (GlyRs). The problem states it does not affect GABA receptors at the given concentration. Therefore, the abolition of IPSCs by strychnine confirms their glycinergic nature.\n3.  **Quantal Analysis (Locus of Action):** The quantal hypothesis posits that neurotransmission is packet-based.\n    -   **mIPSC Amplitude (Quantal Size):** Corresponds to the postsynaptic response to a single vesicle of neurotransmitter. It is determined by postsynaptic factors like the number and density of receptors, their single-channel conductance, and their affinity for the transmitter. A change in mIPSC amplitude typically indicates a postsynaptic mechanism.\n    -   **mIPSC Frequency:** Corresponds to the rate of spontaneous vesicle fusion. It is determined by presynaptic factors like the probability of release ($P_r$) and the number of available release sites ($N$). A change in mIPSC frequency indicates a presynaptic mechanism.\n    -   **mIPSC Kinetics (e.g., decay time constant, $\\tau$):** Reflects the properties of the postsynaptic receptors, such as how long they stay open after binding the neurotransmitter. A change in kinetics indicates a postsynaptic mechanism.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Adding TTX at $1 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$ blocks voltage-gated sodium channels, eliminating action potential–dependent release, so the remaining spontaneous inhibitory events are mIPSCs generated by single-vesicle fusion.**\nThis statement accurately describes the function of TTX in this experimental context. TTX blocks voltage-gated $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ channels, preventing the generation and propagation of action potentials. Synaptic events that persist in the presence of TTX are therefore independent of action potentials. By definition, these are miniature postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs), which arise from the spontaneous fusion of single synaptic vesicles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Strychnine at $1 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$ is a competitive antagonist at postsynaptic GlyRs; abolition of the recorded mIPSCs by strychnine indicates that the events were glycinergic, thereby pharmacologically isolating glycinergic mIPSCs.**\nThis statement correctly describes the pharmacological identification step. Strychnine is a well-known antagonist of GlyRs. Since the problem specifies that it does not block GABAergic currents, its ability to abolish the recorded mIPSCs serves as definitive proof that these currents are mediated by glycine acting on GlyRs. This is a standard method for pharmacologically isolating or identifying a specific component of synaptic transmission.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. If a treatment increases mIPSC frequency without altering the distribution of mIPSC amplitudes or their decay time constants, this supports a presynaptic mechanism such as increased release probability or an increased number of active release sites.**\nThis statement is a classic application of quantal analysis. mIPSC frequency reflects the presynaptic rate of spontaneous vesicle release. mIPSC amplitude and decay kinetics reflect postsynaptic receptor properties. A manipulation that selectively alters frequency without affecting amplitude or kinetics must be acting on the presynaptic terminal, for instance by changing the release probability ($P_r$) or the number of release sites ($N$).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. A selective decrease in mIPSC mean amplitude with unchanged event frequency after a manipulation indicates reduced presynaptic release probability rather than a postsynaptic change.**\nThis statement misinterprets quantal analysis. A selective decrease in mIPSC mean amplitude points to a postsynaptic change (e.g., reduced number or sensitivity of postsynaptic receptors). An unchanged event frequency indicates no change in the presynaptic release machinery. Reduced presynaptic release probability would cause a decrease in mIPSC frequency, not amplitude. The statement incorrectly links a postsynaptic effect (amplitude change) to a presynaptic cause.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. If strychnine reduces mIPSC amplitudes by $50\\%$ without changing their frequency, the currents are glycinergic but the antagonist must be acting presynaptically to reduce vesicular glycine content.**\nThis statement contains a logical flaw. While a reduction in amplitude proves the currents are at least partially glycinergic, the interpretation of the mechanism is incorrect. A change in amplitude without a change in frequency points to a postsynaptic site of action. Strychnine is a postsynaptic receptor antagonist. A non-saturating concentration of a competitive antagonist like strychnine would reduce the effective number of available receptors, thereby reducing the average mIPSC amplitude, without affecting the presynaptic release rate (frequency). The claim that it acts presynaptically to alter vesicular content is contrary to its known mechanism and the evidence presented (frequency is unchanged).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. TTX is required to distinguish glycinergic from GABAergic events because TTX selectively blocks GABA type A receptors.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect on two counts. First, the agent used to distinguish glycinergic from GABAergic events is a specific receptor antagonist (e.g., strychnine for glycine, bicuculline for GABA), not TTX. Second, TTX does not block GABA type A receptors; it blocks voltage-gated sodium channels.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**G. A change in the mIPSC decay time constant $\\tau$ without a change in event frequency is consistent with a postsynaptic change in GlyR properties (for example, subunit composition or receptor modulation) and supports a postsynaptic mechanism.**\nThis statement is correct. The decay kinetics of a postsynaptic current are determined by the intrinsic properties of the postsynaptic receptor channels, such as their channel-closing rate or desensitization rate. These properties can be modified by changes in the receptor's subunit composition or through modulation by signaling pathways (e.g., phosphorylation). Since frequency is unchanged, the presynaptic machinery is unaffected. Therefore, a change in $\\tau$ is a hallmark of a postsynaptic mechanism.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCG}$$", "id": "5021563"}]}
