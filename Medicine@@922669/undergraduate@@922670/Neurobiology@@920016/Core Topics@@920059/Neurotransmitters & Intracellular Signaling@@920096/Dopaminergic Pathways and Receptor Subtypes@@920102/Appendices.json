Let $R$ denote the free receptor, $L$ denote the free ligand, and $RL$ denote the receptor-ligand complex. The reversible binding reaction is given by:\n$$R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$$\nAccording to the law of mass action, the dissociation constant, $K_D$, is defined at equilibrium as the ratio of the product of the concentrations of the reactants to the concentration of the product:\n$$K_D = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\nwhere $[R]$, $[L]$, and $[RL]$ are the equilibrium concentrations of the free receptor, free ligand, and receptor-ligand complex, respectively.\n\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the concentrations of free receptors and bound receptors:\n$$[R]_{\\text{total}} = [R] + [RL]$$\nFractional occupancy, $f$, is defined as the fraction of total receptors that are bound to the ligand:\n$$f = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}}$$\nTo express $f$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_D$, we first rearrange the definition of $K_D$ to solve for $[R]$:\n$$[R] = \\frac{K_D [RL]}{[L]}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for $[R]_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$[R]_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{K_D [RL]}{[L]} + [RL]$$\nFactoring out $[RL]$ gives:\n$$[R]_{\\text{total}} = [RL] \\left( \\frac{K_D}{[L]} + 1 \\right) = [RL] \\left( \\frac{K_D + [L]}{[L]} \\right)$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $[R]_{\\text{total}}$ into the definition of fractional occupancy $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{[RL]}{[RL] \\left( \\frac{K_D + [L]}{[L]} \\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_D + [L]}{[L]}}$$\nSimplifying this complex fraction yields the desired expression for fractional occupancy, which is a specific form of the Hill-Langmuir equation for non-cooperative binding:\n$$f = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_D}$$\n\nThe next step is to compute the fractional occupancies for the $D_1$ and $D_2$ receptors, denoted as $f_{D1}$ and $f_{D2}$, respectively. The ligand is dopamine, so $[L]$ corresponds to the extracellular dopamine concentration, $[DA]$.\nThe given values are:\n$[DA] = 100\\,\\text{nM}$\n$K_D$ for $D_1$ receptors, $K_{D}^{D1} = 2\\,\\mu\\text{M}$\n$K_D$ for $D_2$ receptors, $K_{D}^{D2} = 50\\,\\text{nM}$\n\nBefore calculation, units must be consistent.

Rounding to three significant figures gives:\n$$f_{D1} \\approx 0.0476$$\n\nNext, we calculate the fractional occupancy for the $D_2$ receptor, $f_{D2}$:\n$$f_{D2} = \\frac{[DA]}{[DA] + K_{D}^{D2}} = \\frac{100\\,\\text{nM}}{100\\,\\text{nM} + 50\\,\\text{nM}} = \\frac{100}{150} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $0.66666...$.

Comparing the occupancies, $f_{D2} \\approx 0.667$ is significantly larger than $f_{D1} \\approx 0.0476$. Therefore, the $D_2$ receptor subtype is preferentially engaged under these tonic conditions.\n\nThe qualitative justification for this finding lies in the differing affinities of the two receptor subtypes for dopamine. The dissociation constant, $K_D$, is an inverse measure of binding affinity; a lower $K_D$ indicates a higher affinity. Here, $K_{D}^{D2} = 50\\,\\text{nM}$ is much smaller than $K_{D}^{D1} = 2000\\,\\text{nM}$, signifying that $D_2$ receptors have a much higher affinity for dopamine than $D_1$ receptors. The tonic dopamine concentration of $100\\,\\text{nM}$ is sufficient to occupy a substantial fraction ($>50\\%$) of the high-affinity $D_2$ receptors, as it is above their $K_D$ value. In contrast, the same concentration is far below the $K_D$ value of the low-affinity $D_1$ receptors, resulting in very low occupancy ($<5\\%$). Consequently, tonic levels of dopamine in the striatum primarily act upon the high-affinity $D_2$ receptor population.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.0476 & 0.667 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5013178"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the endogenous ligand dopamine to therapeutic drugs, we encounter more complex modes of action.

This response is achieved when all $N$ receptors are occupied by a full agonist. By definition, a full agonist has an intrinsic efficacy of $1$.\n\nThe contribution of a single receptor occupied by a full agonist to the total response is $\\frac{R_{\\text{max}}}{N}$.\nThe intrinsic efficacy, $E$, is defined as the fraction of the maximal downstream effect produced by a single occupied receptor relative to a full agonist. Therefore, the response generated by a single receptor occupied by the partial agonist in question (pramipexole) is:\n$$ \\text{Response per occupied receptor} = E \\times \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{max}}}{N} \\right) $$\n\nThe steady-state receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, is the fraction of the total receptor population that is ligand-bound. The total number of occupied receptors, $N_{\\text{occ}}$, is therefore:\n$$ N_{\\text{occ}} = \\theta \\times N $$\n\nThe total macroscopic response, $R_{\\text{total}}$, is the product of the number of occupied receptors and the response per occupied receptor. This follows from the given assumption that the contributions of each occupied receptor are independent and proportional.\n$$ R_{\\text{total}} = N_{\\text{occ}} \\times (\\text{Response per occupied receptor}) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $N_{\\text{occ}}$ and the response per occupied receptor:\n$$ R_{\\text{total}} = (\\theta \\times N) \\times \\left( E \\times \\frac{R_{\\text{max}}}{N} \\right) $$\nThe total number of receptors, $N$, cancels out:\n$$ R_{\\text{total}} = E \\times \\theta \\times R_{\\text{max}} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the fractional net $D_3$ receptor activation, $A$. This is logically interpreted as the total response, $R_{\\text{total}}$, normalized to the maximal possible response, $R_{\\text{max}}$.\n$$ A = \\frac{R_{\\text{total}}}{R_{\\text{max}}} $$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $R_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$ A = \\frac{E \\times \\theta \\times R_{\\text{max}}}{R_{\\text{max}}} $$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for fractional activation:\n$$ A = E \\times \\theta $$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation of $A$**\n\nThe problem provides the following values for the agonist pramipexole acting on $D_3$ receptors:\nIntrinsic efficacy, $E = 0.6$\nReceptor occupancy, $\\theta = 0.8$\n\nUsing the derived formula, the numerical value of the fractional net activation $A$ is calculated as:\n$$ A = (0.6) \\times (0.8) $$\n$$ A = 0.48 $$\nThis is a dimensionless quantity, as it represents a fraction of the maximal possible system response.\n\n**Part 3: Qualitative Explanation of Neurobiological Consequences**\n\nThe calculated fractional activation is $A=0.48$. This indicates that the $D_3$ receptor population is being stimulated to produce $48\\%$ of the maximal possible inhibitory signal that could be generated through this pathway. The consequences of this activation can be understood by considering the known signaling cascade and neural circuitry.\n\n1.  **Cellular Mechanism:** The problem states that the $D_3$ receptor couples to inhibitory $G_{i/o}$ proteins. Upon agonist binding and activation, the $G_{i/o}$ protein inhibits the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. This leads to a decrease in the intracellular concentration of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). A primary downstream effector of cAMP is Protein Kinase A (PKA). Therefore, $D_3$ receptor activation causes a reduction in PKA activity.\n\n2.  **Effect on Medium Spiny Neuron (MSN) Signaling:** The Nucleus accumbens (NAcc) is predominantly composed of medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which are GABAergic and thus inhibitory. PKA phosphorylates numerous ion channels and transcription factors that generally act to increase the excitability of the MSN. Consequently, the $D_3$-agonist-induced reduction in PKA activity will lead to a state of decreased neuronal excitability. This makes the $D_3$-expressing MSNs less likely to fire action potentials in response to excitatory inputs, primarily from glutamatergic projections originating in the cortex, thalamus, and amygdala. The net effect of $D_3$ receptor activation at the single-cell level is therefore inhibitory, dampening the signaling output of the neuron.\n\n3.  **Circuit-Level and Behavioral Effects:** MSNs in the NAcc are broadly divided into two populations that form the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia loops. $D_3$ receptors are expressed primarily on MSNs of the indirect pathway (which also express $D_2$ receptors). Activation of this pathway is typically associated with behavioral inhibition or the suppression of non-selected motor programs. Therefore, a significant activation ($A=0.48$) of $D_3$ receptors in the NAcc would be expected to strongly suppress the activity of the indirect pathway MSNs. This cellular inhibition would contribute to the complex modulation of motivated behavior. While the ultimate behavioral output can be nuanced (as drugs like pramipexole can cause paradoxical effects like impulse control disorders, likely through actions in different brain regions or on different receptor subtypes), the direct and primary consequence of $D_3$ activation in NAcc MSNs is the suppression of their firing rate, which is a key mechanism for regulating reward-seeking and goal-directed actions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.48}\n$$", "id": "5013176"}, {"introduction": "Receptor-level events ultimately shape the activity of entire neural circuits, with profound consequences for behavior and disease.
