This indicates that the inertial forces are three orders of magnitude smaller than the viscous forces. In the nondimensionalized Navier-Stokes equation, the entire left-hand side is multiplied by this small number, $Re$. It is therefore a valid approximation to neglect the inertial terms entirely.

All data are consistent and physically plausible within the context of cellular microenvironments.\n\nThe first part of the problem requires the calculation of shear stress at the apical surface of a crown cell. The second part requires a biophysical explanation for the mechanotransduction mechanism involved in left-right axis specification.\n\nPart 1: Calculation of Shear Stress\n\nThe constitutive law for a one-dimensional simple shear flow in a Newtonian fluid states that the shear stress, $\\tau$, is directly proportional to the local velocity gradient. For a fluid with velocity $u$ in the tangential direction that varies with height $y$ normal to the surface, this relationship is expressed as:\n$$\n\\tau = \\mu \\frac{du}{dy}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and $\\frac{du}{dy}$ is the rate of shear strain, or the velocity gradient.\n\nThe problem states that the velocity profile is linear. A linear velocity profile can be described by the function:\n$$\nu(y) = ay + b\n$$\nwhere $a$ is the constant velocity gradient and $b$ is the fluid velocity at the surface ($y=0$). The velocity gradient is the derivative of $u(y)$ with respect to $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dy} = \\frac{d}{dy}(ay + b) = a\n$$\nSince the velocity profile is linear, the gradient $a$ is constant throughout the fluid layer in the region of measurement. We can determine this constant gradient from the two given data points: $(y_1, u_1)$ and $(y_2, u_2)$.\n$$\na = \\frac{\\Delta u}{\\Delta y} = \\frac{u_2 - u_1}{y_2 - y_1}\n$$\nThe shear stress $\\tau$ is therefore constant for all $y$ within this linear profile. The shear stress at the apical surface ($y=0$) is given by:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{surface}} = \\mu \\left. \\frac{du}{dy} \\right|_{y=0} = \\mu \\cdot a = \\mu \\left(\n\\frac{u_2 - u_1}{y_2 - y_1}\n\\right)\n$$\nThe key assumptions for this derivation are:\n1.  The nodal fluid behaves as an incompressible Newtonian fluid.\n2.  The flow is laminar and can be modeled as a one-dimensional simple shear flow.\n3.  The velocity profile is linear in the region between $y_1$ and $y_2$, as stated in the problem. This implies a constant velocity gradient, and thus a constant shear stress, in this region. The calculated shear stress is applied to the surface at $y=0$ under this linearity assumption.\n\nWe now compute the numerical value of the shear stress.

The currently accepted mechanism is grounded in the \"two-cilia hypothesis\" and involves mechanotransduction via primary cilia.\n\n1.  **Sensing Apparatus**: The peripherally located crown cells possess solitary, immotile primary cilia that project into the nodal cavity. These cilia function as mechanosensors. They are distinct from the motile cilia in the center of the node that generate the fluid flow.\n\n2.  **Mechanical Actuation**: The directional, leftward flow of the nodal fluid generated by the motile cilia exerts a shear stress and a corresponding viscous drag force on the immotile cilia of the crown cells. This force causes the cilia on the left side of the node to bend, while the cilia on the right side experience significantly less or no flow and thus do not bend.\n\n3.  **Signal Transduction**: The mechanical bending of the cilium is converted into a biochemical signal. This process is mediated by a protein complex located in the ciliary membrane, composed of the polycystin proteins PKD1L1 and PKD2.\n    -   **PKD1L1 (Polycystin-1-like-1)** is hypothesized to be the primary mechanosensor that detects the physical strain of ciliary bending.\n    -   **PKD2 (Polycystin-2)** is a calcium-permeable cation channel. Upon activation by the mechanically-stimulated PKD1L1, the PKD2 channel opens.\n\n4.  **Generation of Asymmetric Signal**: The opening of the PKD2 channel allows for an influx of extracellular calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) into the cytoplasm of the crown cell. Because only the cilia on the left side of the node are bent by the flow, this $Ca^{2+}$ influx occurs specifically in the crown cells on the left, creating a localized, transient increase in intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ concentration. This asymmetric calcium signal is the first molecular event that breaks the embryo's bilateral symmetry.\n\n5.  **Downstream Molecular Cascade**: This asymmetric $Ca^{2+}$ signal on the left side initiates a downstream signaling pathway. It leads to the localized suppression of the expression of *Dand5* (also known as *Cerl2*), a gene that encodes an inhibitor of the Nodal signaling pathway. By repressing this inhibitor on the left side, the activity of the signaling molecule Nodal is permitted to increase. The resulting high concentration of Nodal on the left side of the node activates a well-characterized gene regulatory network involving transcription factors like *Lefty* and *Pitx2*, which ultimately orchestrates the asymmetric development of organs such as the heart, lungs, and gut.\n\nIn summary, the shear stress from the nodal flow is sensed by the bending of immotile primary cilia on crown cells, transduced into an asymmetric calcium signal via the PKD1L1/PKD2 channel complex, and subsequently converted into an asymmetric pattern of gene expression that defines the left-right body axis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.912 \\times 10^{-2}}$$", "id": "4909144"}, {"introduction": "This final practice connects the microscopic mechanisms of nodal flow to macroscopic, clinical outcomes in humans. When the genetic machinery for ciliary motion, such as the gene *DNAH5*, is faulty, the deterministic leftward flow is lost, leading to randomized organ positioning.

From histological and embryological principles, motile monocilia at the embryonic Left-Right Organizer (LRO, also called the node) generate a leftward fluid flow that biases the Nodal-Lefty-Paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 (Pitx2) signaling cascade to the left lateral plate mesoderm. Loss of ciliary motility perturbs this flow and can lead to either a global mirror-image pattern known as situs inversus totalis or a spectrum of discordant organ situs known as heterotaxy.\n\nIn a registry of $160$ patients with biallelic *DNAH5* loss-of-function mutations, laterality phenotypes were cataloged as follows: situs inversus totalis in $68$ cases, heterotaxy in $18$ cases, and situs solitus in $74$ cases.

No units are required.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents an accurate biological context and a clearly defined statistical task.\n\nThe problem requires two distinct components: first, a biological explanation for the observed spectrum of laterality defects based on embryological principles, and second, a Bayesian statistical calculation to estimate the probability of heterotaxy among all laterality defects.\n\n**Part 1: Embryological Explanation of Laterality Defects**\n\nThe establishment of the left-right body axis in vertebrates is a fundamental process of embryonic development. The currently accepted model, the nodal flow hypothesis, posits that this critical symmetry-breaking event occurs at the Left-Right Organizer (LRO), a transient midline structure known as the node in mammals.\n\n1.  **Nodal Ciliary Function:** The ventral surface of the node is populated by embryonic cells, each bearing a single motile cilium. These nodal cilia possess a rotational beat. Due to a consistent posterior tilt of their rotational axis, this movement imparts a net leftward direction to the flow of extraembryonic fluid across the node.\n\n2.  **Signal Transduction:** This leftward fluid flow constitutes the primary asymmetric cue. It is thought to be sensed by immotile cilia at the periphery of the node, which act as mechanosensors or chemosensors that detect the unilateral flow of signaling molecules. This sensory input triggers an intracellular calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) flux specifically on the left side of the node.\n\n3.  **Asymmetric Gene Cascade:** The asymmetric calcium signal initiates a complex gene regulatory cascade, which is conserved across vertebrates. This cascade is dominated by the expression of the signaling molecule Nodal on the left side of the lateral plate mesoderm. Nodal expression is reinforced through a positive feedback loop and is restricted to the left side by the expression of its inhibitor, Lefty, in the midline and on the right. Downstream of Nodal, the transcription factor Pitx2 is activated, also on the left side. Pitx2 is considered a master regulator of asymmetric morphogenesis, directly instructing the looping and positioning of the heart, gut, and other visceral organs.\n\n4.  **Consequences of Ciliary Dysfunction:** The gene *DNAH5* encodes a heavy chain protein that is a critical component of the outer dynein arms of motile cilia. Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in *DNAH5*, as described in the problem, lead to immotile or severely dysmotile cilia. This condition is known as Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD).\n    *   **Loss of Directional Flow:** When the nodal cilia are immotile, the leftward flow is absent. Without this deterministic cue, the choice of the left-right axis is effectively randomized. This leads to two principal outcomes with roughly equal probability. In approximately $50\\%$ of cases, the embryo develops with the normal organ arrangement (situs solitus) by chance. In the other approximately $50\\%$ of cases, a complete, mirror-image reversal of all visceral organs occurs, a condition known as situs inversus totalis. The observed data ($74$ cases of situs solitus out of $160$, or $46.25\\%$) is consistent with this randomization hypothesis.\n    *   **Origin of Heterotaxy:** Heterotaxy represents a more complex failure of axis specification, where the arrangement of organs is discordant (e.g., a right-sided stomach with a left-sided liver, or abnormalities like polysplenia/asplenia). This outcome suggests an ambiguous or noisy signal rather than a clean \"coin-toss\" randomization. It may arise if ciliary motility is not completely lost but is instead weak or uncoordinated, generating a turbulent or insufficient nodal flow. Such a perturbed flow could create a weak or improperly shaped gradient of the Nodal signal, failing to provide a robust, all-or-none instruction to all developing organ fields. Different organ primordia might then interpret the ambiguous signal discordantly, leading to the mixed laterality characteristic of heterotaxy.\n\n5.  **Interpretation of Observed Frequencies:** The registry data shows $68$ cases of situs inversus totalis and $18$ cases of heterotaxy. The higher frequency of situs inversus totalis compared to heterotaxy among individuals with laterality defects suggests that the most common consequence of the complete loss of outer dynein arms is a total abrogation of directed flow, leading to a clean (though random) binary choice. The less frequent outcome, heterotaxy, likely represents the subset of cases where the underlying biological process results in a noisy, intermediate signal rather than a complete loss of signal.\n\n**Part 2: Bayesian Estimation of the Probability of Heterotaxy**\n\nWe are tasked with estimating the probability, $p$, that a laterality defect is heterotaxy, given that a defect has occurred. The alternative is situs inversus totalis, which has a probability of $1-p$. The analysis is confined to the subset of patients with laterality defects.\n\nThe number of patients with heterotaxy is $n_{H} = 18$.\nThe number of patients with situs inversus totalis is $n_{SI} = 68$.\nThe total number of trials (patients with a laterality defect) is $n = n_{H} + n_{SI} = 18 + 68 = 86$.\n\nEach case is modeled as a Bernoulli trial. Let 'success' be the outcome 'heterotaxy'. The number of successes is $k = n_{H} = 18$. The number of failures is $n-k = n_{SI} = 68$. The likelihood of observing $k$ successes in $n$ trials is given by the binomial probability mass function, which is proportional to $p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$.\n\nWe are given a uniform prior distribution for $p$, which is a Beta distribution with parameters $\\alpha=1$ and $\\beta=1$.\n$$ P(p) = \\mathrm{Beta}(p | \\alpha=1, \\beta=1) $$\nThe Beta distribution is the conjugate prior for the Bernoulli/Binomial likelihood.
