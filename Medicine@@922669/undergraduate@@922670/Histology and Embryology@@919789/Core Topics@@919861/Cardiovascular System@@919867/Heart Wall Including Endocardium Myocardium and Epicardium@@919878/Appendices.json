It is a standard application of linear elasticity theory to a biomechanical system, is well-posed with sufficient data, and is scientifically grounded.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of stress distributions in a thick-walled spherical shell, a qualitative argument based on the result, and a quantitative calculation. We begin with the principles of continuum mechanics under conditions of spherical symmetry.\n\nFor a static, spherically symmetric body with no body forces, the only non-trivial equation of equilibrium (Cauchy's equation) in spherical coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma_{r}}{dr} + \\frac{2}{r}(\\sigma_{r} - \\sigma_{t}) = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{r}$ is the radial stress and $\\sigma_{t} = \\sigma_{\\theta} = \\sigma_{\\phi}$ is the circumferential or hoop stress.\n\nThe general solution to this differential equation for an elastic material can be shown to have the form:\n$$\n\\sigma_{r}(r) = A - \\frac{B}{r^3}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{t}(r) = A + \\frac{B}{2r^3}\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants determined by the boundary conditions.

Stress is defined as positive for tension, so the compressive effect of pressure corresponds to a negative stress.\n1.  At the inner radius $r=a$: $\\sigma_{r}(a) = -p_{i}$\n2.  At the outer radius $r=b$: $\\sigma_{r}(b) = -p_{o}$\n\nApplying these conditions to the equation for $\\sigma_{r}(r)$:\n1.  $-p_{i} = A - \\frac{B}{a^3}$\n2.  $-p_{o} = A - \\frac{B}{b^3}$\n\nWe solve this system of two linear equations for $A$ and $B$. Subtracting the second equation from the first:\n$$\n-p_{i} - (-p_{o}) = \\left(A - \\frac{B}{a^3}\\right) - \\left(A - \\frac{B}{b^3}\\right)\n$$\n$$\np_{o} - p_{i} = B\\left(\\frac{1}{b^3} - \\frac{1}{a^3}\\right) = B\\left(\\frac{a^3 - b^3}{a^3 b^3}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $B$:\n$$\nB = \\frac{(p_{o} - p_{i})a^3 b^3}{a^3 - b^3} = \\frac{(p_{i} - p_{o})a^3 b^3}{b^3 - a^3}\n$$\nNow, we solve for $A$ using the second boundary condition equation:\n$$\nA = -p_{o} + \\frac{B}{b^3} = -p_{o} + \\frac{(p_{i} - p_{o})a^3 b^3}{(b^3 - a^3)b^3} = -p_{o} + \\frac{(p_{i} - p_{o})a^3}{b^3 - a^3}\n$$\n$$\nA = \\frac{-p_{o}(b^3 - a^3) + (p_{i} - p_{o})a^3}{b^3 - a^3} = \\frac{-p_{o}b^3 + p_{o}a^3 + p_{i}a^3 - p_{o}a^3}{b^3 - a^3} = \\frac{p_{i}a^3 - p_{o}b^3}{b^3 - a^3}\n$$\n\nHaving found the constants $A$ and $B$, we write the final expressions for the stress distributions:\n$$\n\\sigma_{r}(r) = \\frac{p_{i}a^3 - p_{o}b^3}{b^3 - a^3} - \\frac{(p_{i} - p_{o})a^3 b^3}{b^3 - a^3} \\frac{1}{r^3}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{t}(r) = \\frac{p_{i}a^3 - p_{o}b^3}{b^3 - a^3} + \\frac{(p_{i} - p_{o})a^3 b^3}{2(b^3 - a^3)} \\frac{1}{r^3}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation of the stress distributions.\n\nNext, we analyze the hoop stress distribution to rationalize the histological structure. We use the given approximation $p_{o} \\approx 0$. Setting $p_{o}=0$, the constant expressions simplify to:\n$$\nA = \\frac{p_{i}a^3}{b^3 - a^3}\n$$\n$$\nB = \\frac{p_{i}a^3 b^3}{b^3 - a^3}\n$$\nThe hoop stress $\\sigma_{t}(r)$ becomes:\n$$\n\\sigma_{t}(r) = \\frac{p_{i}a^3}{b^3 - a^3} + \\frac{p_{i}a^3 b^3}{2(b^3 - a^3)r^3} = \\frac{p_{i}a^3}{b^3 - a^3} \\left(1 + \\frac{b^3}{2r^3}\\right)\n$$\nTo determine how $\\sigma_{t}$ varies with the radius $r$, we examine its derivative with respect to $r$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma_{t}}{dr} = \\frac{p_{i}a^3}{b^3 - a^3} \\left( \\frac{b^3}{2} \\right) \\left( -3r^{-4} \\right) = -\\frac{3 p_{i}a^3 b^3}{2(b^3 - a^3)r^4}\n$$\nGiven that $p_{i}>0$, $b>a>0$, and $r>0$, every term in this expression is positive except for the leading negative sign. Thus, $\\frac{d\\sigma_{t}}{dr} < 0$ for all $r \\in [a, b]$. This signifies that $\\sigma_{t}(r)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of the radius $r$.\n\nConsequently, the maximum hoop stress occurs at the minimum radius, $r=a$ (the endocardial side), and the minimum hoop stress occurs at the maximum radius, $r=b$ (the epicardial side).\nFrom a biomechanical and histological perspective, mechanical stress is a potent stimulus for tissue growth and remodeling (a concept often generalized as Wolff's Law). The region of a structure bearing the highest load must be the most robust. Since the tensile hoop stress is greatest at the inner wall and decreases progressively towards the outer wall, the majority of the wall's structural material is required near the inside. This rationalizes the observation that the myocardium, the thick contractile muscle layer, constitutes the bulk of the heart wall's thickness. The endocardium (inner lining) and epicardium (outer covering) are thin layers whose primary functions are not load-bearing, whereas the thick myocardium is optimally placed to bear the high stresses generated by blood pressure.\n\nFinally, we quantify the stress gradient by computing the ratio $R \\equiv \\frac{\\sigma_{t}(a)}{\\sigma_{t}(b)}$. Using the simplified expression for $\\sigma_{t}(r)$ with $p_{o}=0$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{t}(a) = \\frac{p_{i}a^3}{b^3 - a^3} \\left(1 + \\frac{b^3}{2a^3}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{t}(b) = \\frac{p_{i}a^3}{b^3 - a^3} \\left(1 + \\frac{b^3}{2b^3}\\right) = \\frac{p_{i}a^3}{b^3 - a^3} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{p_{i}a^3}{b^3 - a^3} \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThe ratio $R$ is:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\frac{p_{i}a^3}{b^3 - a^3} \\left(1 + \\frac{b^3}{2a^3}\\right)}{\\frac{p_{i}a^3}{b^3 - a^3} \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{b^3}{2a^3}}{\\frac{3}{2}}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{2}{3}\\left(1 + \\frac{b^3}{2a^3}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{b^3}{3a^3} = \\frac{1}{3}\\left(2 + \\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)^3\\right)\n$$\nWe are given the numerical values $a=1.5 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{m}$ and $b=3.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{m}$. The ratio of the radii is:\n$$\n\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-2}}{1.5 \\times 10^{-2}} = 2\n$$\nSubstituting this value into the expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{1}{3}\\left(2 + 2^3\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}(2 + 8) = \\frac{10}{3}\n$$\nThis is the final exact value for the ratio.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{10}{3}}$$", "id": "4898623"}, {"introduction": "The thick, powerful myocardium established in our first practice presents a significant physiological challenge: how to adequately supply oxygen to every single muscle cell.

This result highlights that diffusion is a relatively slow process for supplying oxygen over the scale of the subendocardial thickness. The subendocardium is the most distal region relative to the epicardial coronary arteries and is subjected to high intramyocardial pressure during systole, which impedes blood flow. During periods of reduced perfusion (e.g., due to coronary artery disease or tachycardia), the oxygen supply to the subendocardium becomes critically limited. The relatively long diffusion time demonstrates that if perfusion through local capillaries is compromised, diffusion from the ventricular lumen or more distant patent vessels cannot adequately compensate for the high metabolic demand of the cardiomyocytes in this region, thus explaining its particular vulnerability to ischemia compared to the better-perfused myocardium and epicardium.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.625}\n$$", "id": "4898671"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the normal structure of the heart wall is the foundation for diagnosing its diseases.

Your task is to carefully dissect the evidence to distinguish endocardial fibroelastosis from a mural thrombus and a myocardial scar, thereby sharpening your diagnostic reasoning and appreciation for histopathology [@problem_id:4898615].", "problem": "An infant aged $3$ months presents with progressive heart failure and echocardiography shows a uniformly bright, thickened left ventricular endocardial surface without discrete masses. At autopsy, the endocardium is diffusely thickened, smooth, and pearly-white. Histological sections of the left ventricle reveal a continuous subendocardial band beneath an intact endothelial lining that is composed of densely packed collagen interwoven with abundant elastic fibers. No layered fibrin, platelet aggregates, or entrapped red blood cells are seen at the luminal surface. In a separate adult case aged $58$ years with prior myocardial infarction, the left ventricular cavity contains a polypoid mass adherent to the endocardial surface; histology of this mass shows alternating pale and dark bands with fibrin, platelets, and entrapped cells, and zones of capillary and fibroblast ingrowth at the interface with the wall. Within the infarcted myocardium remote from the cavity, replacement by dense collagen with loss of myocytes is noted, without a continuous subendocardial elastic-rich layer.\n\nStarting from the core histological definitions of the heart wall layers (endocardium, myocardium, epicardium), the definition of a thrombus as an intravascular aggregate of fibrin and platelets formed during life, and the general sequence of tissue repair (acute inflammation, granulation tissue, and collagenous scar), select all statements that correctly define endocardial fibroelastosis and distinguish it histologically from mural thrombus and organizing myocardial scar.\n\nA.

The provided case descriptions serve as paradigms for each condition. We will analyze these based on the fundamental principles of histology and pathology.\n\nThe heart wall is composed of three layers, from innermost to outermost: the endocardium, a thin layer of endothelium and subendothelial connective tissue; the myocardium, the thick cardiac muscle layer; and the epicardium, the outer covering.\n\n1.  **Endocardial Fibroelastosis (EFE):** As described in the infant case (age 3 months), EFE is a primary disease of the endocardium. Histologically, it is characterized by a diffuse, often marked thickening of the endocardium due to the proliferation of both collagen and, critically, elastic fibers. This proliferation occurs in the subendothelial layer, beneath an intact endothelial lining. Grossly, this gives the endocardium a \"pearly-white\" appearance. It is a non-thrombotic and generally non-inflammatory process. The elastic fiber proliferation is a key diagnostic feature, highlighted by stains like Verhoeff–Van Gieson (VVG).\n\n2.  **Mural Thrombus:** As described in the adult case (age 58 years), a mural thrombus is a blood clot formed in contact with the endocardial lining of a heart chamber. By definition, a thrombus is an aggregate of fibrin, platelets, and entrapped blood cells formed *in vivo*. Grossly visible laminations, known as lines of Zahn, represent alternating layers of pale platelets/fibrin and darker red blood cells, confirming its formation in flowing blood. The thrombus is an *intraluminal* mass attached *to* the endocardial surface. Over time, it undergoes \"organization,\" where granulation tissue (capillaries and fibroblasts) from the underlying endocardium and myocardium grows into the base of the thrombus. The thrombus itself is devoid of a native elastic fiber network.\n\n3.  **Organizing Myocardial Scar:** As described in the infarcted myocardium of the adult case, this is the end result of tissue repair following myocyte necrosis (e.g., from a myocardial infarction). The process involves the removal of dead myocytes by macrophages, followed by the formation of granulation tissue and, finally, replacement by a dense, collagenous scar. This scar is located *within the myocardium*. While it restores structural integrity, it is a non-contractile patch. Histologically, it consists of dense, often hyalinized collagen (predominantly type I), with a variable number of entrapped fibroblasts and a paucity of elastic fibers. It is a process of myocardial replacement, not endocardial thickening.\n\nWith these definitions, we will now evaluate each option.\n\nA. Endocardial fibroelastosis is a diffuse, noninflammatory thickening of the endocardium characterized by proliferation of subendocardial collagen and elastic fibers beneath an intact endothelial lining; special stains such as Verhoeff–Van Gieson accentuate the elastic fiber network, which is not a feature of mural thrombus.\nThis statement is a precise and accurate definition of EFE, consistent with the case description and established pathological principles.

It correctly identifies its intraluminal location, its composition (fibrin, platelets), and the process of organization. The final clause is critical and correct: a mural thrombus does not, by itself, induce or represent a proliferation of elastic fibers in the subendocardium, which is the hallmark of EFE.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nC.

It correctly identifies its location (myocardium), its composition (dense collagen, poor in elastic fibers) as a replacement for myocytes, and its distinction from EFE. A scar is not a continuous, subendocardial, *elastic-rich* band, which is the defining feature of EFE.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. Endocardial fibroelastosis can be identified grossly and microscopically as a laminated mass with lines of Zahn, indicating alternating layers of fibrin and platelets, which is diagnostic and distinguishes it from organizing thrombus.\nThis statement is factually incorrect. It incorrectly ascribes the features of a mural thrombus (laminated mass, lines of Zahn, fibrin/platelets) to EFE. Lines of Zahn are diagnostic of a thrombus, not EFE. The problem's description of EFE explicitly notes the absence of fibrin and platelet aggregates.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. The key histological hallmark of mural thrombus that distinguishes it from both endocardial fibroelastosis and organizing scar is proliferation of elastic fibers within the subendocardial connective tissue, best demonstrated with elastic stains.\nThis statement is the inverse of the truth.

All three entities—endocardial fibroelastosis, mural thrombus, and organizing myocardial scar—show comparable dense elastic fiber accumulation on elastic stains, making them indistinguishable by elastin-specific histochemistry alone.\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The central point of distinction is the differential elastic fiber content. EFE is uniquely characterized by dense accumulation of elastic fibers.
