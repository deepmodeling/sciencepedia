This exercise models the cell as an \"ideal osmometer\" to explore how it responds to changes in the osmotic pressure of its environment, a fundamental principle underlying the clinical osmotic fragility test. By deriving the relationship between external salt concentration and cell volume, you will calculate the hypotonic breaking point for a typical red blood cell [@problem_id:4887412].", "problem": "A red blood cell (RBC) behaves as an ideal osmometer, meaning water moves freely across its membrane and the cell membrane is effectively impermeable to sodium chloride (NaCl) on the experimental timescale.

An RBC has an initial volume of $90$ fL when suspended in an isotonic external NaCl solution of concentration $154$ mM.

Express your final answer in millimoles per liter (mM) and round to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the relationship between a red blood cell's (RBC) volume and the external sodium chloride concentration, and subsequently the calculation of the critical external concentration that leads to hemolysis. This analysis is based on two fundamental principles: the conservation of impermeant intracellular solutes and the condition of osmotic equilibrium.\n\nFirst, we define the relevant variables and states.\nLet $V$ be the volume of the RBC and $C$ be the osmolarity (total concentration of osmotically active particles). The subscripts 'in' and 'ext' will denote intracellular and extracellular environments, respectively. The subscripts 'i' and 'crit' will denote the initial (isotonic) and critical (hemolytic) states.\n\nThe problem states that the RBC behaves as an ideal osmometer, which implies two key conditions:\n1.  **Conservation of intracellular osmoles:** The total amount (moles) of impermeant solutes inside the cell, $N_{in}$, is constant as the cell volume changes. This can be expressed as:\n    $$N_{in} = C_{in} \\times V = \\text{constant}$$\n    Therefore, for any two equilibrium states $1$ and $2$, we have $C_{in,1} \\times V_1 = C_{in,2} \\times V_2$.\n\n2.  **Osmotic equilibrium:** Water moves across the cell membrane until the intracellular osmolarity equals the extracellular osmolarity.\n    $$C_{in} = C_{ext}$$\n\nThe solute is sodium chloride ($NaCl$), which is stated to be fully dissociated in solution. The dissociation reaction is $NaCl \\rightarrow Na^{+} + Cl^{-}$. This means each mole of $NaCl$ produces two moles of osmotically active particles. The van 't Hoff factor, $i$, is therefore $2$. The external osmolarity, $C_{ext}$, is related to the molar concentration of $NaCl$, denoted as $C_{NaCl,ext}$, by:\n$$C_{ext} = i \\times C_{NaCl,ext} = 2 \\times C_{NaCl,ext}$$\n\nNow, we analyze the initial state. The RBC has an initial volume $V_i = 90$ fL when suspended in an isotonic external $NaCl$ solution of concentration $C_{NaCl,ext,i} = 154$ mM. \"Isotonic\" means the cell is at osmotic equilibrium and maintains its normal volume. The initial external osmolarity is:\n$$C_{ext,i} = 2 \\times C_{NaCl,ext,i} = 2 \\times 154 \\, \\text{mM} = 308 \\, \\text{mOsm/L}$$\nDue to osmotic equilibrium, the initial intracellular osmolarity must be equal to the external osmolarity:\n$$C_{in,i} = C_{ext,i} = 308 \\, \\text{mOsm/L}$$\n\nFrom the principle of conservation of intracellular osmoles, we can write:\n$$C_{in,i} \\times V_i = N_{in} = \\text{constant}$$\nFor any arbitrary equilibrium state where the cell has volume $V$ and is in an external solution of osmolarity $C_{ext}$, we have:\n$$C_{in} \\times V = N_{in}$$\nand\n$$C_{in} = C_{ext}$$\nCombining these, we get $C_{ext} \\times V = N_{in}$. Since $N_{in}$ is constant, we can equate the expression for the initial state with that of any other state:\n$$C_{ext} \\times V = C_{in,i} \\times V_i$$\nThis is the general relation between cell volume and external osmolarity. To find the relation connecting cell volume $V$ and the external $NaCl$ concentration $C_{NaCl,ext}$, we substitute $C_{ext} = 2 \\times C_{NaCl,ext}$:\n$$(2 \\times C_{NaCl,ext}) \\times V = C_{in,i} \\times V_i$$\nSolving for $V$, we obtain the requested relation:\n$$V = \\frac{C_{in,i} \\times V_i}{2 \\times C_{NaCl,ext}}$$\nSubstituting the initial values gives:\n$$V = \\frac{(308 \\, \\text{mOsm/L}) \\times (90 \\, \\text{fL})}{2 \\times C_{NaCl,ext}} = \\frac{13860}{C_{NaCl,ext}} \\, \\frac{\\text{mOsm} \\cdot \\text{fL}}{\\text{L}}$$\nThis equation, $V \\propto 1/C_{NaCl,ext}$, is a form of the Boyle-van't Hoff law for ideal osmometers.\n\nNext, we calculate the critical external $NaCl$ concentration, $C_{NaCl,crit}$, that causes hemolysis. Hemolysis occurs when the cell volume reaches the critical value $V_{crit} = 110$ fL. We use the derived relationship at this critical point:\n$$V_{crit} = \\frac{C_{in,i} \\times V_i}{2 \\times C_{NaCl,crit}}$$\nWe can now solve for $C_{NaCl,crit}$:\n$$C_{NaCl,crit} = \\frac{C_{in,i} \\times V_i}{2 \\times V_{crit}}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$C_{in,i} = 308 \\, \\text{mOsm/L}$$\n$$V_i = 90 \\, \\text{fL}$$\n$$V_{crit} = 110 \\, \\text{fL}$$\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$C_{NaCl,crit} = \\frac{(308 \\, \\text{mOsm/L}) \\times (90 \\, \\text{fL})}{2 \\times (110 \\, \\text{fL})}$$\nThe units of volume (fL) cancel, leaving the concentration in mOsm/L, which is equivalent to mM for the concentration of the salt itself.\n$$C_{NaCl,crit} = \\frac{308 \\times 90}{2 \\times 110} \\, \\text{mM}$$\n$$C_{NaCl,crit} = \\frac{27720}{220} \\, \\text{mM}$$\n$$C_{NaCl,crit} = \\frac{2772}{22} \\, \\text{mM}$$\n$$C_{NaCl,crit} = 126 \\, \\text{mM}$$\nThe result $126$ has three significant figures, as requested. This is the external $NaCl$ concentration at which the RBC swells to its critical volume and lyses.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{126} $$", "id": "4887412"}, {"introduction": "Clinical laboratory results provide a window into cellular health, but their true power comes from understanding what they represent.

MCHC represents the average concentration of hemoglobin packed within the cytosol of a red blood cell.\nStructurally, it is a measure of the density of hemoglobin molecules inside the erythrocyte. The biconcave shape of a normal erythrocyte is crucial for maximizing the surface-area-to-volume ratio, which facilitates gas exchange. This shape is maintained by the cell's cytoskeleton and is influenced by its internal contents. A normal MCHC is consistent with a normal cell volume and hemoglobin content, which supports the maintenance of the characteristic biconcave disc morphology. In histology, this normal morphology is observed as an erythrocyte with a distinct central pallor in a Wright-stained blood smear.\nFunctionally, hemoglobin is the protein responsible for oxygen transport. Therefore, MCHC is a direct indicator of the oxygen-carrying capacity per unit volume of the cellular fraction of blood. A lower-than-normal MCHC, a condition known as hypochromia, means that the erythrocytes contain less hemoglobin than normal relative to their size. Histologically, these cells appear paler and have an enlarged area of central pallor. This condition impairs the blood's overall ability to transport oxygen. A higher-than-normal MCHC (hyperchromia) would imply that the cells are oversaturated with hemoglobin. This is physically constrained by the solubility of hemoglobin, which is near its limit in normal RBCs. Conditions associated with hyperchromia often involve a decrease in cell volume rather than an actual increase in hemoglobin concentration, such as in spherocytosis, where cells become spherical and lose their central pallor. Thus, MCHC is a critical parameter that links the biochemical composition of an erythrocyte to its histological appearance and its physiological function.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{33.33}\n$$", "id": "4887392"}, {"introduction": "The primary mission of the erythrocyte is to transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues.
