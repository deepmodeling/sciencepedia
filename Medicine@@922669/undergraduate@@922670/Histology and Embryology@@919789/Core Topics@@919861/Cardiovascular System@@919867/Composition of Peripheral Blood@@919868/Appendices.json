It is a straightforward application of physical definitions to a biological context, free of scientific flaws, ambiguities, or contradictions. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the hematocrit ($Hct$) based on foundational definitions.\n\n$1$. By definition, the hematocrit is the volume fraction of red blood cells ($V_{RBC, total}$) in a given total volume of whole blood ($V_{blood}$).\n$$Hct = \\frac{V_{RBC, total}}{V_{blood}}$$\n\n$2$. The total volume of red blood cells, $V_{RBC, total}$, is the product of the total number of red blood cells, $N_{RBC}$, in the sample and the mean volume of a single red blood cell, $\\bar{V}_{RBC}$.\n$$V_{RBC, total} = N_{RBC} \\times \\bar{V}_{RBC}$$\n\n$3$. Substituting the expression for $V_{RBC, total}$ from step $2$ into the definition of hematocrit from step $1$ yields:\n$$Hct = \\frac{N_{RBC} \\times \\bar{V}_{RBC}}{V_{blood}}$$\n\n$4$. The red blood cell number density, $n_{RBC}$, is defined as the total number of red blood cells, $N_{RBC}$, per unit volume of whole blood, $V_{blood}$.\n$$n_{RBC} = \\frac{N_{RBC}}{V_{blood}}$$\n\n$5$. By rearranging the terms in the expression for $Hct$ from step $3$, we can isolate the term for number density.\n$$Hct = \\left(\\frac{N_{RBC}}{V_{blood}}\\right) \\times \\bar{V}_{RBC}$$\n\n$6$. Substituting the definition of number density, $n_{RBC}$, from step $4$ into the rearranged expression for $Hct$ from step $5$ gives the desired relationship.\n$$Hct = n_{RBC} \\times \\bar{V}_{RBC}$$\nThe principal assumption in this derivation is that the volume of whole blood, $V_{blood}$, is the reference volume for both the hematocrit ratio and the cell number density, which is consistent with standard clinical and physiological definitions.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided data.\nThe given values are:\n- Number density, $n_{RBC} = 4.8 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.\n- Mean corpuscular volume, $\\bar{V}_{RBC} = 90\\,\\mathrm{fL}$.\n\nTo ensure dimensional consistency, the volume unit must be the same for both quantities. We will convert femtoliters ($\\mathrm{fL}$) to liters ($\\mathrm{L}$) using the provided conversion factor, $1\\,\\mathrm{fL} = 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{L}$.\n$$\\bar{V}_{RBC} = 90\\,\\mathrm{fL} = 90 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{L}$$\n\nSubstitute the numerical values for $n_{RBC}$ and $\\bar{V}_{RBC}$ into the derived formula:\n$$Hct = (4.8 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}) \\times (90 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{L})$$\n\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$Hct = (4.8 \\times 90) \\times (10^{12} \\times 10^{-15})$$\n$$Hct = 432 \\times 10^{-3}$$\n$$Hct = 0.432$$\n\nThe units ($\\mathrm{L}^{-1} \\times \\mathrm{L}$) cancel, resulting in a dimensionless quantity, as expected for a volume fraction.\n\nThe problem explicitly requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $0.432$. To express this with four significant figures, a trailing zero must be added.\n$$Hct = 0.4320$$\nThis is the final answer expressed as a unitless decimal fraction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4320}$$", "id": "4877163"}, {"introduction": "While hematocrit tells us about the volume of red blood cells, their primary function is to transport oxygen.

It is a valid quantitative problem in physiology.

This is determined by the hemoglobin concentration $[Hb]$, the oxygen-binding capacity of hemoglobin ($k_{Hb}$), and the arterial oxygen saturation ($S_{aO_2}$).\nThe formula for this component is:\n$$C_{HbO_2} = [Hb] \\times k_{Hb} \\times S_{aO_2}$$\nUsing the provided values:\n- $[Hb] = 15 \\, \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{dL}}$\n- $k_{Hb} = 1.34 \\, \\frac{\\text{mL O}_2}{\\text{g}}$\n- $S_{aO_2} = 0.97$ (dimensionless fraction)\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$C_{HbO_2} = 15 \\times 1.34 \\times 0.97$$\n$$C_{HbO_2} = 20.1 \\times 0.97$$\n$$C_{HbO_2} = 19.497 \\, \\frac{\\text{mL O}_2}{\\text{dL}}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the amount of oxygen physically dissolved in the plasma.
