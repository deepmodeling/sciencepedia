Derivation of Circumferential Stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$**\n\nTo derive the expression for the circumferential Cauchy stress, $\\sigma_{\\theta}$, we analyze the static mechanical equilibrium of a segment of the cylindrical artery. Let the cylinder have a mid-wall radius $r$, a wall thickness $t$, and be subjected to a uniform internal transmural pressure $P$. Consider a longitudinal segment of the artery of length $L$.\n\nWe create a free-body diagram by conceptually bisecting this cylindrical segment along a plane that includes the cylinder's central axis. We analyze the forces acting on one half of the bisected segment. For the segment to be in static equilibrium, the force exerted by the internal pressure that tends to separate the two halves must be balanced by the tensile forces within the artery wall at the points of bisection.\n\nThe force due to pressure, $F_P$, acts perpendicularly to the internal surface. The total separating force is the pressure $P$ multiplied by the projected area over which it acts. This projected area is a rectangle with dimensions of the cylinder's diameter ($2r$) and its length ($L$).\n$$ F_P = P \\times (2r \\times L) $$\n\nThe resisting force, $F_{\\sigma}$, is generated by the circumferential stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ acting on the cross-sectional area of the wall that has been cut. The cut exposes two rectangular surfaces, each with an area of wall thickness $t$ times segment length $L$. Therefore, the total area resisting the separation is $2 \\times (t \\times L)$. Assuming the stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ is uniform across this area (a valid assumption for a thin-walled cylinder), the total resisting force is:\n$$ F_{\\sigma} = \\sigma_{\\theta} \\times (2 \\times t \\times L) $$\n\nFor static equilibrium, these two opposing forces must be equal:\n$$ F_P = F_{\\sigma} $$\n$$ P(2rL) = \\sigma_{\\theta}(2tL) $$\n\nWe can cancel the common terms $2$ and $L$ from both sides of the equation:\n$$ Pr = \\sigma_{\\theta}t $$\n\nSolving for the circumferential stress, $\\sigma_{\\theta}$, we obtain the final expression:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta} = \\frac{Pr}{t} $$\nThis relationship is a specific application of the Law of Laplace for cylindrical pressure vessels, commonly known as Barlow's formula.\n\n**2. Numerical Computation of $\\sigma_{\\theta}$**\n\nWe are given the following values:\nTransmural pressure, $P = 13.3 \\text{ kPa}$.\nMid-wall radius, $r = 15 \\text{ mm}$.\nNumber of lamellar units, $N = 50$.\nAverage lamellar unit thickness, $s = 50 \\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the total wall thickness $t$. The units for $s$ must be converted to millimeters to match the units of $r$.\n$$ s = 50 \\,\\mu\\text{m} = 50 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ mm} = 0.050 \\text{ mm} $$\nThe total wall thickness $t$ is the product of the number of lamellar units $N$ and the thickness of each unit $s$:\n$$ t = Ns = 50 \\times 0.050 \\text{ mm} = 2.5 \\text{ mm} $$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into the derived expression for $\\sigma_{\\theta}$. Since the ratio $r/t$ is dimensionless, the resulting stress will be in the same units as the pressure $P$.\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta} = P \\frac{r}{t} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta} = (13.3 \\text{ kPa}) \\times \\frac{15 \\text{ mm}}{2.5 \\text{ mm}} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta} = (13.3 \\text{ kPa}) \\times 6 $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta} = 79.8 \\text{ kPa} $$\nThe computed circumferential stress is $79.8 \\text{ kPa}$. The result is already expressed with three significant figures as required.\n\n**3. Explanation of Rupture Risk**\n\nThe derived relationship $\\sigma_{\\theta} = \\frac{Pr}{t}$ is central to understanding the mechanical stability of elastic arteries. This equation demonstrates that for a given transmural pressure $P$ and wall thickness $t$, the circumferential stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ in the artery wall is directly proportional to its radius $r$.\n\nMaterial failure, such as the rupture of an artery wall, occurs when the stress exerted on the material exceeds its ultimate tensile strength (UTS). The UTS is an intrinsic property of the tissue.\n\nPathological conditions such as aneurysm involve a localized dilation of the artery, which is an increase in its radius $r$. If this dilation occurs without a compensatory thickening of the arterial wall (i.e., $t$ remains constant or does not increase proportionally), the direct proportionality $\\sigma_{\\theta} \\propto r$ dictates that the stress in the wall must increase to maintain equilibrium against the constant internal pressure $P$. This elevated stress brings the arterial wall material closer to its failure point (its UTS). Consequently, a larger radius at constant thickness significantly elevates the risk of mechanical failure and catastrophic rupture. This principle underscores the inherent instability of aneurysmal dilations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{79.8}$$", "id": "4884055"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the stress on an artery wall is the first step; the next is to characterize how the wall responds to that stress.

Tangential Elastic Modulus ($E_{tan}$)**\nThe tangential (or incremental) elastic modulus, $E_{tan}$, is the slope of the stress-strain curve. We are asked to compute this as the least-squares slope of $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ versus $\\epsilon_{\\theta}$ across the three data points ($i=1, 2, 3$).\nThe data points are $(\\epsilon_{\\theta i}, \\sigma_{\\theta i})$:\n- $(0.04, 70.2~\\mathrm{kPa})$\n- $(7/90, 97.0~\\mathrm{kPa})$\n- $(1/9, 125.0~\\mathrm{kPa})$\n\nPerforming a linear regression on these three stress-strain data points yields a slope of:\n$$E_{tan} \\approx 769.27~\\mathrm{kPa}$$\nThe problem asks for the result in $\\mathrm{MPa}$, rounded to three significant figures.\n$1~\\mathrm{MPa} = 1000~\\mathrm{kPa}$.\n$E_{tan} = 769.27~\\mathrm{kPa} = 0.76927~\\mathrm{MPa}$.\nRounding to three significant figures gives $E_{tan} = 0.769~\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\n**4. Interpretation**\nThe mechanical behavior of elastic arteries is characterized by a J-shaped or non-linear stress-strain curve. This is a direct consequence of its composite structure, primarily comprising elastin and collagen fibers within the vessel wall.\n- At low pressures and strains, the load is borne almost entirely by the elastin network. Elastin is a highly compliant protein, and this regime is characterized by a low elastic modulus, typically reported in the range of $0.3 - 0.6~\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n- As pressure and strain increase, the initially wavy and coiled collagen fibers begin to straighten, uncrimp, and progressively bear load. Collagen is a much stiffer protein than elastin (modulus of ~1 GPa). Its recruitment leads to a rapid increase in the vessel's stiffness. This is reflected by a much higher tangential modulus in the stress-strain curve, often exceeding several MPa.\n\nThe calculated tangential modulus in the pressure range of $12-20~\\mathrm{kPa}$ ($90-150~\\mathrm{mmHg}$) is approximately $0.77~\\mathrm{MPa}$. This value is at the upper end of, or slightly above, the range associated with a purely elastin-dominant response. It is significantly lower than the modulus expected if collagen were fully engaged. Therefore, the modulus of $0.77~\\mathrm{MPa}$ indicates that the arterial wall in this pressure range is transitioning from the low-stiffness, elastin-dominant regime to the high-stiffness regime. It signifies that **significant collagen fiber recruitment is occurring**, but the fibers are not yet fully load-bearing.

Derivation of Arterial Compliance ($C$)\n\nCompliance is defined as the change in volume per unit change in pressure:\n$$C = \\frac{dV}{dP}$$\nThe arterial segment is modeled as a cylinder of length $L$ and radius $r$. Its volume $V$ is given by $V = \\pi r^2 L$.\nA differential change in volume $dV$ due to a change in radius $dr$ (assuming constant length $L$) is:\n$$dV = \\frac{d}{dr}(\\pi r^2 L) dr = 2 \\pi r L dr$$\nTo relate $dr$ to a differential change in pressure $dP$, we use a first-principles approach based on the mechanics of a thin-walled cylindrical vessel. The hoop stress $\\sigma_H$ in the vessel wall is given by:\n$$\\sigma_H = \\frac{Pr}{h}$$\nwhere $P$ is the transmural pressure and $h$ is the wall thickness.\nThe material's elastic property is described by the incremental Young's modulus, $E$, which relates differential stress $d\\sigma_H$ to differential strain $d\\epsilon_H$:\n$$E = \\frac{d\\sigma_H}{d\\epsilon_H}$$\nThe hoop strain $\\epsilon_H$ is the fractional change in circumference, which is equivalent to the fractional change in radius: $\\epsilon_H = \\frac{r - r_0}{r_0}$, where $r_0$ is the radius at zero pressure. The differential form is:\n$$d\\epsilon_H = \\frac{dr}{r}$$\nCombining these, we get $d\\sigma_H = E \\cdot d\\epsilon_H = E \\frac{dr}{r}$.\nNow we find the differential of the hoop stress equation. Assuming $h$ is constant and $r$ changes only slightly with pressure, we differentiate $\\sigma_H$ with respect to $P$:\n$$d\\sigma_H = d\\left(\\frac{Pr}{h}\\right) \\approx \\frac{r}{h} dP$$\nEquating the two expressions for $d\\sigma_H$:\n$$\\frac{r}{h} dP = E \\frac{dr}{r}$$\nRearranging to find the relationship between $dr$ and $dP$:\n$$\\frac{dr}{dP} = \\frac{r^2}{Eh}$$\nNow we substitute this into the expression for compliance, $C = \\frac{dV}{dP} = 2 \\pi r L \\frac{dr}{dP}$:\n$$C = 2 \\pi r L \\left(\\frac{r^2}{Eh}\\right) = \\frac{2 \\pi r^3 L}{Eh}$$\nThis is the required formula for the compliance of the equivalent arterial segment.\n\n#### 2.

This is a key assumption of the two-element Windkessel model for relating stroke volume ($SV$) to pulse pressure ($PP$).
