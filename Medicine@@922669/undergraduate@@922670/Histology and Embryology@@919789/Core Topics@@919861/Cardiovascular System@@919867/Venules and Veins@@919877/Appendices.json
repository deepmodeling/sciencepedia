Consider a segment of the cylinder of length $L$. The force $F_P$ exerted by the internal pressure $P$ that tends to separate one half of the cylinder from the other acts on the projected area, which is the diameter ($2r$) times the length ($L$).\n$$\nF_P = P \\cdot (2rL)\n$$\nThis pressure-induced force is balanced by the tensile force $F_{\\text{wall}}$ within the material of the cylinder wall. This force is the product of the hoop stress $\\sigma_h$ and the cross-sectional area of the wall resisting the separation. This area is the wall thickness $t$ multiplied by the length $L$, on both sides of the cylinder.\n$$\nF_{\\text{wall}} = \\sigma_h \\cdot (2tL)\n$$\nFor the cylinder to be in equilibrium, these forces must be equal:\n$$\nF_P = F_{\\text{wall}}\n$$\n$$\nP \\cdot (2rL) = \\sigma_h \\cdot (2tL)\n$$\nSolving for the hoop stress $\\sigma_h$ by canceling the term $2L$ from both sides, we obtain the formula known as the Law of Laplace for a cylindrical vessel:\n$$\n\\sigma_h = \\frac{Pr}{t}\n$$\nThe problem requires all quantities to be in SI units before calculation.

The formula $\\sigma_h = Pr/t$ provides insight into the structural differences between veins and arteries.\nArteries operate under much higher pressures (mean arterial pressure is typically around $90-100\\ \\text{mmHg}$) compared to veins (e.g., the $12\\ \\text{mmHg}$ in this problem). Arteries of a similar classification (e.g., medium-sized) also tend to have a larger radius $r$. According to the formula, a higher pressure $P$ and a larger radius $r$ both contribute to a significantly higher wall stress $\\sigma_h$. To prevent mechanical failure (rupture), the tissue's tensile strength must not be exceeded. Biological systems manage this by adjusting wall thickness $t$.\nFor an artery to withstand this much larger stress, its wall must be substantially thicker and stronger than that of a corresponding vein. The tunica media, composed of smooth muscle and elastic fibers, is the primary stress-bearing layer. Histologically, this is observed as a very thick and well-developed tunica media in arteries, which allows them to contain high-pressure blood flow. In contrast, veins, being low-pressure vessels, experience much lower wall stress. Consequently, their tunica media is significantly thinner and less muscular, which is consistent with the low stress value calculated. The structural integrity of veins relies more on their fibrous outer layer, the tunica adventitia, and less on a muscular media.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{8.00}\n$$", "id": "4948225"}, {"introduction": "The thin walls of veins, a consequence of the low wall stress we previously explored, confer their most defining physiological property: high compliance. This practice allows you to quantify this 'stretchiness' by calculating the change in blood volume, $\\Delta V$, resulting from a change in pressure, $\\Delta P$, based on the definition of compliance, $C = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta P}$. This calculation provides a tangible measure of the venous system's role as the body's primary blood reservoir, or capacitance system, and helps explain the physiological phenomenon of venous pooling. [@problem_id:4948275]", "problem": "A physiologist is evaluating venous distensibility in the lower limb of a healthy adult during an orthostatic challenge. In the small pressure range studied, the veins are assumed to have pressure-independent compliance. Venous compliance is defined as the change in volume per change in transmural pressure.

Upon moving from supine to standing, the local venous transmural pressure in the distal limb increases by approximately $\\Delta P = 10\\ \\text{mmHg}$.\n\nUsing only the fundamental definition of compliance as the starting point and assuming it is constant over this pressure range, compute the expected increase in venous volume $\\Delta V$ in this segment. Then, briefly explain how high compliance in veins, grounded in their histological wall composition, modulates the risk of venous pooling during orthostasis. Express the final numerical answer for $\\Delta V$ in milliliters. Provide an exact value (no rounding needed).", "solution": "The problem requires a two-part answer: a quantitative calculation and a qualitative explanation.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Increase in Venous Volume ($\\Delta V$)**\n\nThe problem provides the fundamental definition of compliance, $C$, as the change in volume, $dV$, per unit change in transmural pressure, $dP$. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$C = \\frac{dV}{dP}$$\nThe problem states that compliance is constant over the pressure range of interest. When $C$ is a constant, the relationship between finite changes in volume, $\\Delta V$, and finite changes in pressure, $\\Delta P$, can be simplified from the differential form to an algebraic one:\n$$C = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta P}$$\nWe are asked to compute the expected increase in venous volume, $\\Delta V$. To solve for $\\Delta V$, we can rearrange the equation:\n$$\\Delta V = C \\cdot \\Delta P$$\nNow, we substitute the given values into this equation. The compliance of the femoral venous segment is $C = 20\\ \\text{ml mmHg}^{-1}$, and the increase in transmural pressure is $\\Delta P = 10\\ \\text{mmHg}$.\n$$\\Delta V = \\left(20\\ \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{mmHg}}\\right) \\cdot (10\\ \\text{mmHg})$$\nThe units of pressure ($\\text{mmHg}$) cancel, yielding a result for volume in milliliters ($\\text{ml}$):\n$$\\Delta V = 200\\ \\text{ml}$$\nThus, the expected increase in venous volume in this segment is $200\\ \\text{ml}$.\n\n**Part 2: Explanation of Compliance, Histology, and Venous Pooling**\n\nHigh compliance is the defining characteristic of veins, enabling them to function as capacitance vessels. As calculated above, a modest pressure increase of $10\\ \\text{mmHg}$ results in a substantial volume increase of $200\\ \\text{ml}$ in the specified venous segment. This high distensibility is a direct consequence of the histological composition of the venous wall.\n\nCompared to arteries, veins have significantly thinner and less muscular walls relative to their lumen diameter. The venous wall is composed of three layers: tunica intima, tunica media, and tunica externa (adventitia). The key difference lies in the tunica media. In arteries, this layer is thick and rich in smooth muscle and elastic fibers, which allows them to withstand high pressures and recoil during the cardiac cycle. In veins, the tunica media is substantially thinner, with a sparse arrangement of smooth muscle cells and elastic fibers. The tunica externa, composed primarily of collagen, is often the thickest layer in veins.\n\nThis histological structure—a thin, weakly muscularized wall—confers low resistance to stretching at physiological low pressures. Consequently, veins can accommodate large volumes of blood with only small increases in transmural pressure.\n\nDuring orthostasis (standing upright), gravity imposes a hydrostatic load on the column of blood below the heart. This increases the transmural pressure in the veins of the lower limbs, as given by $\\Delta P$. Due to their high compliance, these veins distend and fill with a significant volume of blood. This phenomenon is known as venous pooling.\n\nThis property modulates risk in a dual manner. On one hand, the ability to pool blood makes veins an essential blood reservoir, buffering changes in circulating volume. On the other hand, excessive venous pooling during orthostasis can be detrimental. It sequesters blood away from the central circulation, leading to a decrease in venous return to the heart. According to the Frank-Starling mechanism, reduced venous return leads to reduced cardiac preload, which in turn causes a fall in stroke volume and cardiac output. If compensatory mechanisms (such as the skeletal muscle pump and sympathetic venoconstriction) are inadequate, the resulting decrease in mean arterial pressure can lead to cerebral hypoperfusion, causing symptoms like dizziness, lightheadedness, or syncope (fainting). Therefore, while high compliance is a crucial physiological feature, it also creates the risk of orthostatic intolerance.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{200}\n$$", "id": "4948275"}, {"introduction": "Having examined the mechanical and systemic properties of veins, we now focus on a critical function at the microvascular level: fluid exchange in postcapillary venules.

The net driving pressure, which we will denote as $P_{net}$, determines the direction and magnitude of fluid flux. A positive $P_{net}$ signifies net filtration (fluid movement out of the vessel), while a negative $P_{net}$ signifies net absorption (fluid movement into the vessel).\n\nWe can derive the expression for $P_{net}$ by considering the four primary forces involved:\n1.  **Capillary hydrostatic pressure ($P_c$):** This is the pressure of the blood inside the venule, which tends to push fluid out into the interstitial space. It is a force promoting filtration.\n2.  **Interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure ($P_i$):** This is the pressure of the fluid in the tissue surrounding the venule, which tends to push fluid into the vessel. It is a force promoting absorption.\n3.  **Plasma colloid osmotic pressure ($\\pi_c$):** Also known as oncotic pressure, this is the osmotic pressure generated by plasma proteins (primarily albumin) within the venule. It tends to pull fluid into the vessel. It is a force promoting absorption.\n4.  **Interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure ($\\pi_i$):** This is the osmotic pressure generated by the small amount of protein that has leaked into the interstitial fluid. It tends to pull fluid out of the vessel. It is a force promoting filtration.\n\nThe net hydrostatic pressure gradient, which drives fluid out of the capillary, is the difference between the capillary and interstitial hydrostatic pressures: $P_c - P_i$.\n\nThe net colloid osmotic pressure gradient, which draws fluid into the capillary, is the difference between the plasma and interstitial colloid osmotic pressures: $\\pi_c - \\pi_i$.\n\nHowever, the endothelial barrier is not perfectly impermeable to proteins. The effectiveness of the colloid osmotic pressure gradient is modulated by the protein reflection coefficient, $\\sigma$. This dimensionless coefficient accounts for the leakiness of the capillary wall to proteins. A value of $\\sigma=1$ would mean the barrier is completely impermeable to proteins and the full osmotic pressure gradient is effective. A value of $\\sigma=0$ would mean the barrier is freely permeable to proteins, and there is no effective osmotic pressure gradient. Therefore, the effective colloid osmotic pressure opposing filtration is given by $\\sigma(\\pi_c - \\pi_i)$.\n\nCombining these components, the signed net driving pressure ($P_{net}$) is the net hydrostatic pressure favoring filtration minus the effective colloid osmotic pressure opposing filtration:\n$$P_{net} = (P_c - P_i) - \\sigma (\\pi_c - \\pi_i)$$\nThis is the modern formulation of the Starling equation for net filtration pressure.\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this equation:\n- Capillary hydrostatic pressure, $P_c = 20 \\text{ mmHg}$\n- Interstitial hydrostatic pressure, $P_i = 2 \\text{ mmHg}$\n- Plasma colloid osmotic pressure, $\\pi_c = 25 \\text{ mmHg}$\n- Interstitial colloid osmotic pressure, $\\pi_i = 5 \\text{ mmHg}$\n- Protein reflection coefficient, $\\sigma = 0.9$\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\nFirst, calculate the net hydrostatic pressure gradient:\n$$P_c - P_i = 20 \\text{ mmHg} - 2 \\text{ mmHg} = 18 \\text{ mmHg}$$\nNext, calculate the net colloid osmotic pressure gradient:\n$$\\pi_c - \\pi_i = 25 \\text{ mmHg} - 5 \\text{ mmHg} = 20 \\text{ mmHg}$$\nThen, calculate the effective colloid osmotic pressure:\n$$\\sigma (\\pi_c - \\pi_i) = 0.9 \\times (20 \\text{ mmHg}) = 18 \\text{ mmHg}$$\nFinally, compute the net filtration pressure, $P_{net}$:\n$$P_{net} = (18 \\text{ mmHg}) - (18 \\text{ mmHg}) = 0 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n\nThe net filtration pressure is $0 \\text{ mmHg}$.
