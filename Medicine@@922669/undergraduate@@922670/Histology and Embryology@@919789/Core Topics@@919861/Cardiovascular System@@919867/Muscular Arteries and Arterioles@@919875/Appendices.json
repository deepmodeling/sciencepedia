A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe task is to classify a blood vessel based on its histological structure, adhering to first principles rather than arbitrary diameter-based cutoffs. The key distinction lies between a small muscular artery and an arteriole.\n\n**1. Estimation of the number of smooth muscle cell layers:**\nThe tunica media is composed of circumferentially arranged smooth muscle cells. The thickness of the tunica media is given as $t_{\\mathrm{media}} = 40\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The radial span of a single smooth muscle cell is given as $7\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ to $8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. We can estimate the number of concentric layers ($N$) of smooth muscle cells:\n$$N = \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{media}}}{\\text{VSMC radial span}}$$\nUsing the provided range for the VSMC span:\n- Lower bound on layers: $N = \\frac{40\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = 5$ layers.\n- Upper bound on layers: $N = \\frac{40\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{7\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 5.7$ layers.\nTherefore, the tunica media consists of approximately $5$ to $6$ layers of smooth muscle cells.\n\n**2. Application of Histological Definitions:**\n- **Arterioles** are defined as having a tunica media composed of $1$ to $2$, or sometimes up to $3$, layers of smooth muscle cells. They are the primary resistance vessels. Their external elastic lamina (EEL) is absent, and the internal elastic lamina (IEL) becomes progressively thinner and disappears in the most terminal arterioles.\n- **Small Muscular Arteries** are defined as having a tunica media with more layers of smooth muscle, typically ranging from $3$ to $8$ or more. A defining characteristic is a prominent, well-defined IEL. An EEL is also typically present, though it may be thin and less distinct than the IEL.\n\nThe vessel in question, with an estimated $5$ to $6$ layers of smooth muscle, fits the definition of a small muscular artery, not an arteriole.\n\n**3. Corroborating Evidence:**\n- The description of the IEL as \"continuous, wavy... sharply delimiting\" is a classic description of the IEL in a muscular artery. While arterioles (except the smallest ones) also have an IEL, it is generally less prominent than in a bona fide artery.\n- The lumen diameter of $D = 120\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ is in a transitional zone where classification by diameter alone is ambiguous. However, historical cutoffs often place the upper limit for arterioles at or below $100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. This further supports the classification as an artery.\n- The EEL is \"not clearly identified\". This feature is characteristic of arterioles but can also be true for the smallest of muscular arteries, where the EEL becomes thin and blends with the surrounding adventitial connective tissue. Given the strong evidence from the number of smooth muscle layers and the prominent IEL, the indistinct EEL does not override the classification as a small muscular artery.\n\n**4. First-Principles Reasoning (Structure and Function):**\nThe problem requires reasoning that connects structure to function, specifically wall support to radius. The physical principle governing this relationship is the Law of Laplace for a cylinder, which states that wall tension ($T$) is proportional to the product of transmural pressure ($P$) and vessel radius ($r$):\n$$T = P \\cdot r$$\nThe stress ($\\sigma$) on the vessel wall is this tension distributed across the wall's thickness ($t$):\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{T}{t} = \\frac{P \\cdot r}{t}$$\nFor a vessel to maintain its integrity, its wall must be strong enough to withstand this stress. In muscular arteries and arterioles, the smooth muscle of the tunica media provides the primary structural support and active tension. As the radius ($r$) of a vessel increases, the wall tension ($T$) it must support increases proportionally (assuming constant pressure). To keep wall stress manageable, the wall thickness ($t$) must also increase. A thicker wall is accomplished by having more layers of smooth muscle cells.\n\nThe vessel in this problem has a radius of $r = D/2 = 60\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and a tunica media of $t_{\\mathrm{media}} = 40\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, composed of $5$ to $6$ cell layers. This substantial wall structure is necessary to support the physical forces acting on a vessel of this radius. A smaller vessel, like a typical arteriole (e.g., $r = 15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$), experiences much lower wall tension and thus requires a proportionally thinner wall (e.g., $1$ to $2$ layers of smooth muscle). The observed structure (a thick, multi-layered tunica media and a strong IEL) is therefore a functional necessity for a vessel of this size, classifying it as an artery.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Arteriole: The small lumen diameter and a high wall-to-lumen ratio alone define arterioles, regardless of the presence of an internal elastic lamina.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It dismisses the number of smooth muscle layers and the nature of the IEL, which are fundamental criteria for classification. While arterioles do have a high wall-to-lumen ratio, this feature is not sufficient for classification, and ignoring other key histological features is a flawed approach. The presence and character of the IEL are critically important. **Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Small muscular artery: A distinct internal elastic lamina and an estimated $\\geq 3$–$5$ circumferential smooth muscle layers in the tunica media indicate an artery; by relating required wall support to radius, a larger radius necessitates more layered smooth muscle, consistent with an arterial classification.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with our derivation. It correctly identifies the two most critical features: the distinct IEL and the number of smooth muscle layers (our estimate of $5$ to $6$ falls in the \"$\\geq 3$–$5$\" range). It then correctly applies the first-principles reasoning relating vessel radius to the required structural support provided by the layered smooth muscle. This option provides a complete and accurate justification. **Correct.**\n\n**C. Arteriole: Because arterioles are primary resistance vessels, they must have a prominent internal elastic lamina to facilitate vasomotion, even when multiple smooth muscle layers are present.**\nThis statement is flawed. First, the most prominent IELs are found in muscular arteries, not arterioles. Second, while the IEL contributes to elasticity, vasomotion (active contraction and relaxation) is primarily a function of the smooth muscle cells themselves. Third, classifying a vessel with \"multiple smooth muscle layers\" (in this case, $5$ to $6$) as an arteriole contradicts the standard histological definition. **Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Indeterminate: Without direct intraluminal pressure or flow measurements, it is not possible to distinguish a small muscular artery from an arteriole in histological sections.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It invalidates the entire basis of histological classification. Morphology (structure) is tightly linked to function, and for over a century, histologists have successfully classified vessels based on microscopic features like layer composition, cell counts, and the presence of specific structures like elastic laminae. The provided structural information is sufficient for a definitive classification. **Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4916849"}, {"introduction": "Having established how to identify an arteriole, we now turn to its primary physiological role: the regulation of blood flow and pressure.

The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid and can be solved as stated.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe hydrodynamic resistance, $R$, for laminar flow through a rigid cylindrical tube is described by the Hagen–Poiseuille equation:\n$$R = \\frac{8\\eta L}{\\pi r^4}$$\nwhere $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, $L$ is the length of the tube, and $r$ is the radius of the lumen.\n\nLet the initial state of the arteriole be denoted by subscript $1$, with radius $r_1$ and resistance $R_1$.\n$$R_1 = \\frac{8\\eta L}{\\pi r_1^4}$$\nThe problem states that viscosity $\\eta$ and length $L$ are constant.\n\nFollowing an increase in sympathetic tone, the arteriolar radius decreases by $10\\%$. Let the final state be denoted by subscript $2$, with radius $r_2$ and resistance $R_2$. The new radius $r_2$ is given by:\n$$r_2 = r_1 - 0.10 \\times r_1 = (1 - 0.10)r_1 = 0.90 r_1$$\n\nThe new resistance, $R_2$, can be expressed in terms of the new radius $r_2$:\n$$R_2 = \\frac{8\\eta L}{\\pi r_2^4}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $r_2$ into the equation for $R_2$:\n$$R_2 = \\frac{8\\eta L}{\\pi (0.90 r_1)^4} = \\frac{8\\eta L}{\\pi (0.90)^4 r_1^4}$$\nWe can separate the constant factors and the term related to the initial resistance $R_1$:\n$$R_2 = \\frac{1}{(0.90)^4} \\left( \\frac{8\\eta L}{\\pi r_1^4} \\right) = \\frac{1}{(0.90)^4} R_1$$\n\nThe problem asks for the fractional change in hydrodynamic resistance, which is defined as $\\frac{\\Delta R}{R_1}$.\n$$\\frac{\\Delta R}{R_1} = \\frac{R_2 - R_1}{R_1}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $R_2$ in terms of $R_1$:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta R}{R_1} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{(0.90)^4} R_1 - R_1}{R_1}$$\nFactoring out $R_1$ from the numerator and simplifying the expression:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta R}{R_1} = \\frac{R_1 \\left( \\frac{1}{(0.90)^4} - 1 \\right)}{R_1} = \\frac{1}{(0.90)^4} - 1$$\n\nNow, we perform the numerical calculation. First, calculate $(0.90)^4$:\n$$(0.90)^4 = 0.6561$$\nSubstitute this value back into the expression for the fractional change:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta R}{R_1} = \\frac{1}{0.6561} - 1$$\n$$ \\frac{1}{0.6561} \\approx 1.5241579...$$\n$$\\frac{\\Delta R}{R_1} \\approx 1.5241579 - 1 = 0.5241579...$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $5$, $2$, $4$, and $1$. The fifth digit is $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$\\frac{\\Delta R}{R_1} \\approx 0.5242$$\nThis result demonstrates that a mere $10\\%$ decrease in radius causes an increase in resistance of approximately $52.42\\%$, highlighting the profound impact of radius on resistance due to the fourth-power relationship.\n\n**Influence on Systemic Pressure**\nThe relationship between pressure, flow, and resistance in the systemic circulation is analogous to Ohm's law, given by:\n$$\\Delta P = Q \\times R_{sys}$$\nHere, $\\Delta P$ is the pressure gradient across the systemic circulation, which is the Mean Arterial Pressure ($P_{MAP}$) minus the Central Venous Pressure ($P_{CVP}$). $Q$ is the cardiac output (total blood flow from the heart per unit time), and $R_{sys}$ is the total systemic vascular resistance. Since $P_{CVP}$ is typically close to $0$, the relationship can be approximated as:\n$$P_{MAP} \\approx Q \\times R_{sys}$$\nThe problem states that arterioles are the principal adjustable resistance elements. Therefore, a change in resistance of individual arterioles causes a significant change in the total systemic resistance, $R_{sys}$. The calculated increase in arteriolar resistance by a factor of approximately $1.5242$ leads to a substantial increase in $R_{sys}$.\n\nAccording to the equation $P_{MAP} \\approx Q \\times R_{sys}$, if cardiac output ($Q$) is assumed to remain constant, an increase in total systemic resistance ($R_{sys}$) will lead to a proportional increase in Mean Arterial Pressure ($P_{MAP}$). Thus, the vasoconstriction of arterioles, driven by sympathetic tone, is a primary physiological mechanism for regulating and increasing systemic blood pressure.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5242}\n$$", "id": "4916584"}, {"introduction": "This final practice takes you deeper into the vessel wall itself, exploring its biomechanical properties.

To find the circumferential (hoop) stress, $\\sigma_{\\theta}$, we perform a force balance on one half of the cylindrical segment, conceptually cut along a diametral plane.\n\nThe force exerted by the transmural pressure $P$ on the internal projected area ($2rL$) is given by:\n$$F_{P} = P \\cdot (2rL)$$\nThis outward-directed force must be balanced by the tensile force within the two sections of the artery wall that were cut. The cross-sectional area of the wall material resisting this force is $2 \\cdot (tL)$. The total resistive force in the wall is:\n$$F_{W} = \\sigma_{\\theta} \\cdot (2tL)$$\nFor static equilibrium, these forces must balance, $F_P = F_W$:\n$$P \\cdot (2rL) = \\sigma_{\\theta} \\cdot (2tL)$$\nSolving for the circumferential stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ yields the Laplace equation for a thin-walled cylinder:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta} = \\frac{Pr}{t}$$\nThis equation is valid for both the pre-treatment (state $0$) and post-treatment (state $1$) conditions. The problem states that $P$, $r$, and $t$ are constant for the comparison. Therefore, the circumferential stress is the same in both states:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta,0} = \\sigma_{\\theta,1} = \\sigma_{\\theta}$$\nLet us calculate this stress value. First, the pressure $P$ must be converted from mmHg to Pascals (Pa):\n$$P = 100~\\text{mmHg} \\times \\frac{133.322~\\text{Pa}}{1~\\text{mmHg}} = 13332.2~\\text{Pa}$$\nNow, substitute the given values into the stress equation:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta} = \\frac{(13332.2~\\text{Pa}) \\cdot (1.5 \\times 10^{-3}~\\text{m})}{1.5 \\times 10^{-4}~\\text{m}} = 13332.2~\\text{Pa} \\times 10 = 133322~\\text{Pa}$$\nAs requested for the intermediate result, expressing this in kilopascals (kPa):\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta} = 133.322~\\text{kPa}$$\n\n2.  **Derivation of Circumferential Strain ($\\epsilon_{\\theta}$)**\n\nThe problem specifies a model of linear elasticity and a state of plane stress, with the circumferential stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ being the only non-negligible stress component ($\\sigma_r \\approx 0$, $\\sigma_z=0$). Under this uniaxial stress condition, Hooke's Law simplifies to a direct proportionality between stress and strain in the circumferential direction:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta} = E \\cdot \\epsilon_{\\theta}$$\nwhere $E$ is the effective circumferential Young's modulus.
