In seminal vesicle hypoplasia, the total ejaculate volume ($V_{\\text{tot,h}}$) is significantly reduced because the seminal vesicle contribution is small. As a constant amount of solute is dissolved in a smaller total volume, the final concentrations ($[\\text{PSA}]_{\\text{hypo}}$ and $[\\text{citrate}]_{\\text{hypo}}$) necessarily increase. This is reflected by the ratio $\\frac{V_{\\text{tot,n}}}{V_{\\text{tot,h}}} > 1$.\n\n-   **Fructose:** This seminal vesicle marker is reduced in both amount and final volume. The total amount of fructose ($m_{F,\\text{h}}$) decreases drastically, proportional to the factor $f=0.20$ (an $80\\%$ reduction). The total volume ($V_{\\text{tot,h}}$) also decreases, but less dramatically (from $3.0\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ to $1.32\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, a reduction to $44\\%$ of the original volume). Since the fractional decrease in the amount of fructose is much larger than the fractional decrease in total volume, the final concentration ($[\\text{fructose}]_{\\text{hypo}}$) must decrease. This is reflected by the ratio $\\frac{[\\mathrm{fructose}]_{\\text{hypo}}}{[\\mathrm{fructose}]_{\\mathrm{normal}}} = f \\frac{V_{\\text{tot,n}}}{V_{\\text{tot,h}}} \\approx 0.2 \\times 2.27 = 0.45 < 1$.\n\nThe biochemical shift index $R$ is thus a composite measure that captures the elevation of prostatic markers and the reduction of the seminal vesicle marker, making it a sensitive indicator for the underlying pathology.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.091}$$", "id": "4913713"}]}
