Consequently, one milliequivalent ($1 \\, \\text{mEq}$) is equal to one millimole ($1 \\, \\text{mmol}$).\nThe added amount of $\\mathrm{H}^+$ is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta n = 10 \\, \\text{mEq} = 10 \\, \\text{mmol} = 10 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{mol} = 0.010 \\, \\text{mol} $$\nGiven that the other numerical values in the problem ($1.000 \\, \\text{L}$, $2.000 \\, \\text{pH}$) possess four significant figures, and the final answer is explicitly requested to be rounded to four significant figures, it is logical to interpret the input value of '$10 \\, \\text{mEq}$' as having a precision consistent with these requirements.

The descriptions of the PAS and Alcian blue staining mechanisms are correct representations of standard histochemical techniques. The distinction between neutral and acidic mucins based on the presence of carboxylate and sulfate groups is fundamental in glycoprotein chemistry and histology. The pH-dependent activity of Alcian blue (pH $2.5$ staining both weakly and strongly acidic mucins) is an established principle. The specified cell types are key components of the fundic gastric glands.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for a prediction based on a set of provided chemical principles and the known physiological roles of specific cells. This structure allows for a unique, derivable solution.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The language is technical, precise, and objective. The \"foundational facts\" provide a clear and unbiased framework for analysis.\n4.  **Completeness**: The problem provides all necessary information to deduce the answer: the stains, their mechanisms, the pH conditions, and the chemical nature of the molecules they target.\n5.  **No other flaws**: The problem does not contain contradictions, unrealistic conditions, or ambiguities.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a standard, well-formulated question in cellular biology and histology. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n## Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires predicting the staining outcome of a combined PAS–Alcian blue stain at pH $2.5$ on two specific cell types in the fundic gastric mucosa: surface mucous cells and mucous neck cells. This prediction must be based on the provided principles and the known functions of these cells.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Stains**:\n    - **PAS (Periodic acid–Schiff)**: This stain targets carbohydrates. Periodic acid oxidizes vicinal diols (adjacent -OH groups on sugar rings) to form aldehydes. The Schiff reagent then reacts with these aldehydes to produce a characteristic magenta color. Since both neutral and acidic mucins are glycoproteins rich in carbohydrate chains, both are expected to be PAS-positive to some degree.\n    - **Alcian blue at pH $2.5$**: This is a cationic (positively charged) dye. At pH $2.5$, it electrostatically binds to anionic (negatively charged) groups present on mucosubstances. As stated in principle (ii), at this pH, both carboxyl groups (R-COO$^{-}$, with pKa values typically in the range of $3-5$) and sulfate groups (R-OSO$_3^{-}$, which are strongly acidic and ionized even at much lower pH) will be sufficiently ionized to bind the dye. Therefore, Alcian blue at pH $2.5$ stains all acidic mucins (both carboxylated and sulfated), turning them blue. Neutral mucins, lacking these acidic groups, will not bind Alcian blue.\n\n2.  **Relate Stains to Cell Function and Mucin Chemistry**:\n    - **Surface Mucous Cells**: These cells line the luminal surface and gastric pits. Their primary role is cytoprotection. They secrete a thick, viscous, insoluble mucus that forms a protective gel layer on the epithelial surface, shielding it from the highly acidic gastric juice (HCl) and proteolytic enzymes (pepsin). This protective mucus is predominantly composed of **neutral mucins**.\n        - **Prediction**: Because they produce neutral mucins, which are rich in carbohydrates but lack acidic groups, surface mucous cells will be strongly PAS-positive (magenta) and Alcian blue-negative.\n    - **Mucous Neck Cells**: These cells are located deeper, in the \"neck\" region of the fundic glands. They are progenitors for the surface cells and secrete a different type of mucus. This mucus is soluble and less viscous, and its composition is primarily **acidic mucins**, specifically sialomucins which contain sialic acid, a carboxylated sugar derivative.\n        - **Prediction**: Because they produce acidic mucins, mucous neck cells will react with Alcian blue at pH $2.5$ due to the ionized carboxyl groups. They are also glycoproteins, so they will possess carbohydrate backbones that can react with PAS. In a combined stain, the presence of significant acidic mucins will lead to a blue (if purely acidic) or blue-purple (if a mix of acidic and neutral components) color. The key distinguishing feature from surface cells is their affinity for Alcian blue.\n\n3.  **Synthesize Expected Outcome**:\n    - The apical cytoplasm of **surface mucous cells** should stain a strong **magenta**, indicating a high concentration of neutral mucins (PAS-positive, Alcian blue-negative).\n    - The cytoplasm of **mucous neck cells** should stain **blue or blue–purple**, indicating the presence of acidic mucins (Alcian blue-positive).\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Surface mucous cells exhibit strong magenta apical cytoplasmic staining with PAS and minimal Alcian blue at pH $2.5$, whereas mucous neck cells stain blue to blue–purple with Alcian blue due to their acidic sialylated or sulfated mucins; this follows because PAS detects vicinal diols in neutral glycoconjugates and Alcian blue at pH $2.5$ binds anionic carboxylate and sulfate groups.**\n- This option correctly describes the expected staining pattern: surface cells are PAS-positive (magenta), and neck cells are Alcian blue-positive (blue/blue-purple).\n- It correctly identifies the biochemical basis: surface cells produce neutral mucins, while neck cells produce acidic (sialylated/carboxylated) mucins.\n- The justification correctly recapitulates the staining principles provided in the problem statement.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Surface mucous cells stain blue with Alcian blue at pH $2.5$ and are weak with PAS because they secrete acidic mucins, while mucous neck cells are magenta with PAS and not blue; this follows because neck mucins are predominantly neutral and thus resist Alcian blue.**\n- This option reverses the known biology of the two cell types. Surface mucous cells produce neutral mucin, not acidic. Mucous neck cells produce acidic mucin, not neutral. The predicted staining pattern is therefore the opposite of what is correct.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Both surface mucous and mucous neck cells are intensely PAS positive and Alcian blue negative because gastric mucins are overwhelmingly neutral; the difference between the cell types reflects only the density of glycoprotein, not their charge.**\n- This option incorrectly assumes that both cell types produce only neutral mucins. It fails to account for the well-established chemical difference, where mucous neck cells are known to produce acidic mucins. This contradicts the basis for the differential staining observed in practice.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Both surface mucous and mucous neck cells appear blue with Alcian blue at pH $2.5$, while parietal cells show strong PAS positivity due to their abundant membrane glycoproteins; the Alcian blue reactivity is driven by the acidic environment of the stomach lumen rather than intrinsic mucin chemistry.**\n- The claim that both cell types stain blue is incorrect; surface cells do not. The assertion that staining is driven by the luminal pH is a critical misunderstanding of histology. Staining reactions occur *ex vivo* in buffered solutions of a defined pH, in this case, pH $2.5$. The *in vivo* luminal environment of the stomach is irrelevant to the chemical reaction on the microscope slide.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Alcian blue must be applied at pH $1.0$ to detect carboxylated mucins, so at pH $2.5$ mucous neck cells would be negative while surface mucous cells would be PAS positive; this follows because carboxyl groups are only ionized at pH $1.0$.**\n- This statement contains a fundamental error in acid-base chemistry and histochemical principles. Carboxyl groups (weak acids) are substantially protonated (uncharged) at pH $1.0$ and would not stain with Alcian blue. They become ionized (negatively charged) as the pH rises above their pKa, and thus they do stain at pH $2.5$. Conversely, strongly acidic sulfate groups stain at both pH $1.0$ and $2.5$. The claim that carboxyl groups are ionized at pH $1.0$ is false. This option also directly contradicts foundational fact (ii) given in the problem.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4893037"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the cellular mechanisms of acid secretion is crucial for developing effective pharmacological treatments for acid-related disorders.

Let $S$ represent the acid secretion rate in milliequivalents per hour (mEq/h). According to the provided principles, $S$ is proportional to the product of two independent factors: the fraction of functional pumps, denoted by $F_p$, and the normalized cAMP-mediated activation state, denoted by $A_c$. This relationship can be expressed as a mathematical equation:\n$$S = k \\cdot F_p \\cdot A_c$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nThe problem states that the baseline acid output, $S_{base}$, is $6$ mEq/h. It also specifies that at baseline, both the fraction of functional pumps and the normalized activation state are at unity.
