Since $J$ is a constant, we have:\n$$\n-D \\frac{dC}{dx} = \\text{constant}\n$$\nThe value of this constant flux is given by the boundary condition at the epithelial surface, $x=0$. The problem states that bicarbonate is produced with a uniform areal rate $S$, which is a flux directed toward increasing $x$. Therefore, we have:\n$$\nJ(x) = S \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in [0, h]\n$$\nCombining this with Fick's law, we obtain the differential equation for $C(x)$:\n$$\n-D \\frac{dC}{dx} = S\n$$\nRearranging gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dx} = -\\frac{S}{D}\n$$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation.
