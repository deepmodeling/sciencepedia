The oral mucosa comprises stratified squamous epithelium supported by a connective tissue lamina propria. In regions subjected to high mechanical loading (masticatory mucosa, such as gingiva and hard palate), the epithelium typically exhibits deeper epithelial downgrowths (rete ridges) into the lamina propria and more pronounced connective tissue papillae. In regions adapted for flexibility (lining mucosa, such as buccal and labial mucosa, soft palate, and floor of mouth), the epithelium is non-keratinized and the rete ridges are shallow or sparse. To quantify the interface morphology, define the rete ridge index as $$R = \\frac{d_{\\text{ridge}}}{t_{\\text{epithelium}}},$$ where $d_{\\text{ridge}}$ is the mean depth of rete ridges and $t_{\\text{epithelium}}$ is the mean total epithelial thickness, with both measured in micrometers.

The tasks involve calculating this index for known and unknown samples, deriving a decision rule based on statistical principles, and applying this rule to classify the unknown sample.\n\nThe first step is to compute the rete ridge index for each of the four known samples.

Let the two classes be masticatory mucosa ($\\omega_{\\mathrm{mast}}$) and lining mucosa ($\\omega_{\\mathrm{line}}$). The problem states we can assume equal prior probabilities ($P(\\omega_{\\mathrm{mast}}) = P(\\omega_{\\mathrm{line}})$) and symmetric misclassification costs. Under these conditions, the Bayes optimal decision rule, which minimizes the average probability of error, is to assign an observation to the class with the maximum posterior probability. Given an observed index $R_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, we choose $\\omega_{\\mathrm{mast}}$ if $P(\\omega_{\\mathrm{mast}}|R_{\\mathrm{obs}}) > P(\\omega_{\\mathrm{line}}|R_{\\mathrm{obs}})$.\nBy Bayes' theorem, $P(\\omega_i|R_{\\mathrm{obs}}) = p(R_{\\mathrm{obs}}|\\omega_i)P(\\omega_i)/p(R_{\\mathrm{obs}})$. As the priors $P(\\omega_i)$ and the evidence $p(R_{\\mathrm{obs}})$ are common to both sides of the inequality, the rule simplifies to choosing the class with the maximum likelihood: choose $\\omega_{\\mathrm{mast}}$ if $p(R_{\\mathrm{obs}}|\\omega_{\\mathrm{mast}}) > p(R_{\\mathrm{obs}}|\\omega_{\\mathrm{line}})$.\nThe decision boundary, $R_{boundary}$, is the point where the likelihoods are equal: $p(R_{boundary}|\\omega_{\\mathrm{mast}}) = p(R_{boundary}|\\omega_{\\mathrm{line}})$.\nA principled choice for the form of the likelihoods, guided by the central limit theorem and the problem's hint of \"comparable within-group variability,\" is to model them as Gaussian distributions, $p(R|\\omega_i) = \\mathcal{N}(R; \\mu_i, \\sigma_i^2)$, with a common variance $\\sigma^2 = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{mast}}^2 = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{line}}^2$.\nThe equality of likelihoods becomes $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(R_{boundary}-\\mu_{\\mathrm{mast}})^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(R_{boundary}-\\mu_{\\mathrm{line}})^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$.\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives $(R_{boundary}-\\mu_{\\mathrm{mast}})^2 = (R_{boundary}-\\mu_{\\mathrm{line}})^2$. The solution to this equation is the midpoint of the two means:\n$$R_{boundary} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{mast}} + \\mu_{\\mathrm{line}}}{2}$$\nWe use the calculated group mean indices as estimates for the true means, so $\\mu_{\\mathrm{mast}} \\approx R_{\\mathrm{mast}}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{line}} \\approx R_{\\mathrm{line}}$.\nThe decision boundary is $R_{boundary} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{mast}} + R_{\\mathrm{line}}}{2}$.\nSubstituting the computed values:\n$R_{boundary} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{103}{168} + \\frac{457}{3339}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{103 \\times 3339 + 457 \\times 168}{168 \\times 3339}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{343917 + 76776}{560952}\\right) = \\frac{420693}{1121904} = \\frac{20033}{53424}$.\nNumerically, $R_{boundary} \\approx 0.3750$.\n\nThe third task is to classify the unknown sample $\\mathrm{U}$. The data are $d_{\\text{ridge}} = [110, 95, 105, 115]~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $t_{\\text{epithelium}} = [280, 300, 290, 310]~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe mean depth is $\\bar{d}_{\\mathrm{U}} = \\frac{1}{4}(110 + 95 + 105 + 115) = \\frac{425}{4} = 106.25~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe mean thickness is $\\bar{t}_{\\mathrm{U}} = \\frac{1}{4}(280 + 300 + 290 + 310) = \\frac{1180}{4} = 295~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe rete ridge index for the unknown sample is $R_{\\mathrm{U}} = \\frac{\\bar{d}_{\\mathrm{U}}}{\\bar{t}_{\\mathrm{U}}} = \\frac{106.25}{295} = \\frac{425}{1180} = \\frac{85}{236}$.\nNumerically, $R_{\\mathrm{U}} \\approx 0.360169$.\n\nTo classify the sample, we compare $R_{\\mathrm{U}}$ with $R_{boundary}$.\n$R_{\\mathrm{U}} \\approx 0.3602$ and $R_{boundary} \\approx 0.3750$.\nSince $R_{\\mathrm{U}} < R_{boundary}$, the observed index falls into the region associated with lining mucosa. Therefore, the unknown sample $\\mathrm{U}$ is more consistent with lining mucosa.\nThe problem asks for the reported value of $R_{\\mathrm{U}}$ rounded to four significant figures.\n$R_{\\mathrm{U}} = \\frac{85}{236} \\approx 0.36016949$.\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.3602$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.3602}\n$$", "id": "4920300"}, {"introduction": "Oral epithelium is a dynamic environment, with a constant balance between cell proliferation and loss maintaining its integrity.
