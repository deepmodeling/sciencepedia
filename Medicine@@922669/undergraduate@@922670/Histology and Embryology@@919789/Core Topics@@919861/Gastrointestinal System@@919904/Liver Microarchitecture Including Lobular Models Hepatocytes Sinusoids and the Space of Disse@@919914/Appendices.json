We assume these two obstacle classes occupy distinct volumes.\n$$\nV_{\\text{obstacles}} = V_{\\text{matrix}} + V_{\\text{villi}}\n$$\nThe problem states that the extracellular matrix has a uniform volume fraction $\\phi_{m}$.

The problem requires us to use the scaling $\\tau^{2} \\approx 1/\\varepsilon$ and to justify it based on obstruction theory for random fibrous media.\n\nThis scaling is a well-known result from effective medium theories. For instance, the Bruggeman effective medium approximation, when applied to a mixture of a conducting phase (void space, with diffusivity $D_{0}$) and a non-conducting phase (solid obstacles, with diffusivity $0$), predicts that the effective property scales with the volume fraction of the conducting phase. For a random, isotropic distribution of obstacles, this theory often leads to a quadratic dependence of the effective diffusivity on the porosity, particularly in the regime where the conducting phase is not dominant:\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx D_{0} \\varepsilon^{2}\n$$\nEquating the general form with this specific scaling gives:\n$$\nD_{0} \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\tau^{2}} = D_{0} \\varepsilon^{2}\n$$\nSolving for $\\tau^{2}$ yields the required relation:\n$$\n\\tau^{2} = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\varepsilon^{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nThis scaling implies that as porosity decreases, the diffusive path length increases more significantly than would be suggested by a linear relationship. This is physically justified in a medium with randomly placed obstructions, where decreasing the void space not only constricts pathways but also forces particles to take much more convoluted routes around the obstacles. The assumption of a \"random fibrous media\" for the matrix and a \"uniform distribution\" of microvilli supports the use of such an isotropic effective medium model.\n\nSubstituting $\\tau^2 = 1/\\varepsilon$ into the given expression for $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ provides a simplified relationship:\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{eff}} = D_{0} \\frac{\\varepsilon}{(1/\\varepsilon)} = D_{0} \\varepsilon^{2}\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Final Expression for the Effective Diffusion Coefficient**\n\nThe final step is to substitute the derived expression for porosity $\\varepsilon$ from Step 1 into the simplified equation for $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ from Step 2.\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{eff}} = D_{0} \\varepsilon^{2} = D_{0} \\left[ 1 - \\left( \\phi_{m} + \\frac{n \\pi r_{v}^{2} L_{v}}{h} \\right) \\right]^{2}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the effective diffusion coefficient as a function of the given parameters: $D_{0}$, $\\phi_{m}$, $n$, $r_{v}$, $L_{v}$, and $h$.
