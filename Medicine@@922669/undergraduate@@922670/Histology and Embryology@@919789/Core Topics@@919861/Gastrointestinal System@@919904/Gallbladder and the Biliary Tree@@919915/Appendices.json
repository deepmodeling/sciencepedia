It models the hierarchical structure of an absorptive epithelium (gallbladder mucosa) using standard geometric shapes (triangles and cylinders). The concept of surface area amplification is a fundamental principle in physiology and histology. The given dimensions are physically realistic for the respective biological scales (millimeters for tissue folds, micrometers for cellular structures).\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary variables, numerical values, and a clear set of simplifying assumptions (planar facets, non-overlapping cylinders, multiplicative amplification) to permit the derivation of a unique, stable, and meaningful solution.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and unambiguous language.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, and well-structured.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived and calculated.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\nThe total effective surface area, $A_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is the result of two sequential amplifications of a basal projected area. We will derive the amplification factor for each level of structure and then combine them.\n\n**1. Projected Area**\nThe macroscopic projected area of the mucosal patch is a simple rectangle.\n$$A_{\\mathrm{proj}} = L \\times W$$\n\n**2. Amplification by Mucosal Folds**\nThe folds are described as a sawtooth profile in the $x$-$z$ plane (assuming height is in the $z$-direction), uniform along the $y$-direction. We can find the amplification factor by considering the ratio of the true surface length to the projected length over one period of a fold. A single period of the sawtooth wave has a projected length of $2b$ in the $x$-direction. This period consists of two planar facets. Each facet forms the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with base $b$ and height $h$.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, the length, $s$, of a single facet is:\n$$s = \\sqrt{b^2 + h^2}$$\nThe total length of the surface over one period is $2s$. The amplification factor due to folds, $F_{\\mathrm{folds}}$, is the ratio of this true length to the projected length $2b$.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{folds}} = \\frac{2s}{2b} = \\frac{\\sqrt{b^2 + h^2}}{b} = \\sqrt{\\frac{b^2+h^2}{b^2}} = \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{h}{b}\\right)^2}$$\nThe surface area of the folded mucosa, $A_{\\mathrm{folds}}$, is the projected area multiplied by this amplification factor.\n$$A_{\\mathrm{folds}} = A_{\\mathrm{proj}} \\times F_{\\mathrm{folds}} = (L W) \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{h}{b}\\right)^2}$$\n\n**3. Amplification by Microvilli**\nThe microvilli are modeled as cylinders on the epithelial surface. The problem asks us to find the amplification factor, $F_{\\mathrm{micro}}$, which is the ratio of the total area of an epithelial patch with microvilli to its area without them.\n\nConsider a small patch of the folded epithelial surface of area $A_{\\mathrm{patch}}$. The number of microvilli on this patch is $N = D \\times A_{\\mathrm{patch}}$. The problem instructs us to calculate the lateral surface area of a right circular cylinder, which is given by the formula $A_{\\mathrm{cylinder, lat}} = 2 \\pi r l$.\n\nThe total lateral surface area added by all microvilli on the patch is:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{added}} = N \\times A_{\\mathrm{cylinder, lat}} = (D \\times A_{\\mathrm{patch}}) \\times (2 \\pi r l)$$\nThe total surface area of the patch with microvilli, $A_{\\mathrm{brush}}$, is the sum of the original patch area and the added lateral area of the microvilli. We neglect the area of the end caps, and the assumption of sparsity means we do not subtract the basal area occupied by the microvilli.\n$$A_{\\mathrm{brush}} = A_{\\mathrm{patch}} + A_{\\mathrm{added}} = A_{\\mathrm{patch}} + A_{\\mathrm{patch}} (2 \\pi r l D) = A_{\\mathrm{patch}} (1 + 2 \\pi r l D)$$\nThe amplification factor due to microvilli, $F_{\\mathrm{micro}}$, is the ratio of $A_{\\mathrm{brush}}$ to $A_{\\mathrm{patch}}$.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{micro}} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{brush}}}{A_{\\mathrm{patch}}} = 1 + 2 \\pi r l D$$\n\n**4. Total Effective Surface Area**\nThe problem states that the total amplification is the product of the amplifications from folds and microvilli. This means the microvilli are distributed over the entire folded surface. Therefore, the total effective area $A_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the folded area $A_{\\mathrm{folds}}$ further amplified by the factor $F_{\\mathrm{micro}}$.\n$$A_{\\mathrm{eff}} = A_{\\mathrm{folds}} \\times F_{\\mathrm{micro}} = \\left( (L W) \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{h}{b}\\right)^2} \\right) \\times (1 + 2 \\pi r l D)$$\nThis is the complete symbolic expression for the effective mucosal surface area.\n\n**5. Numerical Calculation**\nWe are asked to express the final answer in cm$^2$. We must first convert all given parameters to a consistent system of units, namely centimeters.\n-   $L = 20 \\text{ mm} = 2.0 \\text{ cm}$\n-   $W = 5 \\text{ mm} = 0.5 \\text{ cm}$\n-   $h = 0.6 \\text{ mm} = 0.06 \\text{ cm}$\n-   $b = 0.6 \\text{ mm} = 0.06 \\text{ cm}$\n-   $r = 0.04 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{m} = 0.04 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ cm} = 4 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ cm}$\n-   $l = 1.0 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{m} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ cm}$\n-   $D = 20 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{m}^{-2}$.

Substituting these into the integral gives:\n$$\nV(P) - V_r = C_{0} \\int_{0}^{-\\lambda(P-P_r)} e^u \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right) du = -\\frac{C_{0}}{\\lambda} \\int_{0}^{-\\lambda(P-P_r)} e^u du\n$$\nEvaluating the integral of the exponential function:\n$$\nV(P) - V_r = -\\frac{C_{0}}{\\lambda} \\Big[ e^u \\Big]_{0}^{-\\lambda(P-P_r)} = -\\frac{C_{0}}{\\lambda} \\left( \\exp\\big(-\\lambda(P - P_r)\\big) - e^0 \\right)\n$$\nSince $e^0 = 1$, we have:\n$$\nV(P) - V_r = -\\frac{C_{0}}{\\lambda} \\left( \\exp\\big(-\\lambda(P - P_r)\\big) - 1 \\right) = \\frac{C_{0}}{\\lambda} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\big(-\\lambda(P - P_r)\\big) \\right)\n$$\nThis gives the expression for the change in volume. The expression for the total volume $V(P)$ is obtained by adding the resting volume $V_r$:\n$$\nV(P) = V_r + \\frac{C_{0}}{\\lambda} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\big(-\\lambda(P - P_r)\\big) \\right)\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for $V(P)$.\n\nNow, we compute the volume at the maximum tolerated pressure, $P_{\\max} = 12.0$ mmHg. We substitute $P = P_{\\max}$ into the derived expression for $V(P)$:\n$$\nV(P_{\\max}) = V_r + \\frac{C_{0}}{\\lambda} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\big(-\\lambda(P_{\\max} - P_r)\\big) \\right)\n$$\nWe are given the values: $V_r = 18.0$ mL, $C_0 = 10.0$ mL/mmHg, $\\lambda = 0.20$ mmHg$^{-1}$, $P_r = 2.0$ mmHg, and $P_{\\max} = 12.0$ mmHg.\n\nFirst, calculate the term in the exponent:\n$$\n-\\lambda(P_{\\max} - P_r) = -0.20 \\times (12.0 - 2.0) = -0.20 \\times 10.0 = -2.0\n$$\nNext, calculate the pre-factor $\\frac{C_0}{\\lambda}$:\n$$\n\\frac{C_{0}}{\\lambda} = \\frac{10.0 \\text{ mL/mmHg}}{0.20 \\text{ mmHg}^{-1}} = 50.0 \\text{ mL}\n$$\nNow substitute these values back into the equation for $V(P_{\\max})$:\n$$\nV(P_{\\max}) = 18.0 + 50.0 \\left( 1 - \\exp(-2.0) \\right)\n$$\nUsing the value for the exponential function, $\\exp(-2.0) \\approx 0.135335$:\n$$\nV(P_{\\max}) \\approx 18.0 + 50.0 \\times (1 - 0.135335)\n$$\n$$\nV(P_{\\max}) \\approx 18.0 + 50.0 \\times 0.864665\n$$\n$$\nV(P_{\\max}) \\approx 18.0 + 43.23325\n$$\n$$\nV(P_{\\max}) \\approx 61.23325 \\text{ mL}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The number $61.23325$ rounded to four significant figures is $61.23$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{61.23}\n$$", "id": "4892285"}]}
