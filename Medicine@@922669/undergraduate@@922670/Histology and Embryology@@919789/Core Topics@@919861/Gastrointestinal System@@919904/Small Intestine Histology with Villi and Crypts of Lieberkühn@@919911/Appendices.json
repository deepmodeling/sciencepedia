It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. I will now proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Amplification Factor $\\mathcal{A}$\n\nLet us consider a patch of the apical membrane with a projected area $A_{proj}$. The total number of microvilli, $N$, on this patch is given by the product of the areal density $\\rho$ and the projected area:\n$$N = \\rho A_{proj}$$\n\nThe total actual surface area, $A_{actual}$, is the sum of the surface area of all the microvilli and the area of the planar membrane between them.\n$$A_{actual} = A_{microvilli} + A_{planar}$$\n\nFirst, let's determine the surface area of a single microvillus, $A_{mv}$. As a right circular cylinder, its exposed surface area consists of the lateral wall and the top circular cap. The base is the interface with the cell membrane and is not part of the exposed surface.\n-   The lateral surface area of a cylinder is $A_{lateral} = 2\\pi a \\ell$.\n-   The area of the top circular cap is $A_{top} = \\pi a^2$.\nThus, the surface area of one microvillus is:\n$$A_{mv} = A_{lateral} + A_{top} = 2\\pi a \\ell + \\pi a^2$$\nThe total surface area contributed by all $N$ microvilli is:\n$$A_{microvilli} = N \\cdot A_{mv} = (\\rho A_{proj})(2\\pi a \\ell + \\pi a^2)$$\n\nNext, we determine the area of the planar membrane, $A_{planar}$. This is the initial projected area, $A_{proj}$, minus the area occupied by the circular bases of all the microvilli. The area of one microvillus base is $A_{base} = \\pi a^2$.\nThe total area covered by the bases of all $N$ microvilli is:\n$$A_{bases} = N \\cdot A_{base} = (\\rho A_{proj})(\\pi a^2)$$\nThe remaining planar area is therefore:\n$$A_{planar} = A_{proj} - A_{bases} = A_{proj} - \\rho A_{proj} \\pi a^2 = A_{proj}(1 - \\rho \\pi a^2)$$\n\nNow, we can compute the total actual surface area, $A_{actual}$, by summing the components:\n$$A_{actual} = A_{planar} + A_{microvilli}$$\n$$A_{actual} = A_{proj}(1 - \\rho \\pi a^2) + (\\rho A_{proj})(2\\pi a \\ell + \\pi a^2)$$\nFactoring out $A_{proj}$:\n$$A_{actual} = A_{proj} \\left[ (1 - \\rho \\pi a^2) + \\rho(2\\pi a \\ell + \\pi a^2) \\right]$$\nExpanding the terms inside the brackets:\n$$A_{actual} = A_{proj} \\left[ 1 - \\rho \\pi a^2 + 2\\pi a \\ell \\rho + \\rho \\pi a^2 \\right]$$\nThe terms $-\\rho \\pi a^2$ and $+\\rho \\pi a^2$ cancel each other out, which elegantly simplifies the expression:\n$$A_{actual} = A_{proj} (1 + 2\\pi a \\ell \\rho)$$\nThis simplification reveals that the area of the top caps of the microvilli exactly replaces the area of the circular bases removed from the planar membrane. The net increase in area is due solely to the lateral walls of the microvillar cylinders.\n\nThe surface area amplification factor $\\mathcal{A}$ is defined as the ratio $\\frac{A_{actual}}{A_{proj}}$.\n$$\\mathcal{A} = \\frac{A_{proj}(1 + 2\\pi a \\ell \\rho)}{A_{proj}}$$\nThis yields the final analytic expression for the amplification factor:\n$$\\mathcal{A} = 1 + 2\\pi a \\ell \\rho$$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe are asked to evaluate this expression for the given values: $\\rho=40\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}^{-2}$, $\\ell=1.0\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$, and $a=0.05\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $\\mathcal{A}$:\n$$\\mathcal{A} = 1 + 2\\pi (0.05\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}) (1.0\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}) (40\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}^{-2})$$\nThe dimensional analysis confirms that the second term is dimensionless: $\\mathrm{\\mu m} \\cdot \\mathrm{\\mu m} \\cdot \\mathrm{\\mu m}^{-2} = 1$.\n$$\\mathcal{A} = 1 + 2\\pi (0.05 \\times 1.0 \\times 40)$$\n$$\\mathcal{A} = 1 + 2\\pi (2)$$\n$$\\mathcal{A} = 1 + 4\\pi$$\nUsing the value of $\\pi \\approx 3.14159265...$:\n$$\\mathcal{A} = 1 + 4(3.14159265...) = 1 + 12.5663706...$$\n$$\\mathcal{A} \\approx 13.5663706...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

It is free of any of the specified flaws. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the calculation of the average proliferative output of a crypt needed to sustain the associated villus population. The core principle for solving this is the mass-balance argument under the specified steady-state condition.\n\nIn a steady state, the rate of production of cells must exactly equal the rate of loss of cells. Let $R_{prod}$ be the rate of enterocyte production by the crypt (in cells per day) and $R_{loss}$ be the rate of enterocyte loss from the villus tip (in cells per day). The steady-state condition is expressed as:\n$$R_{prod} = R_{loss}$$\nThe problem asks for the \"average proliferative output required per crypt,\" which is precisely $R_{prod}$. Therefore, we need to calculate $R_{loss}$.\n\nThe problem defines the epithelial turnover time, $t$, as the time required to renew the entire villus enterocyte population, $N_{v}$. This definition provides a direct relationship between the total population, the time for renewal, and the rate of renewal (which, in steady state, equals the rate of loss).\n\nAssuming the rate of loss $R_{loss}$ is constant, the total number of cells lost over a period $t$ is the product of the rate and the time, $R_{loss} \\times t$. By definition, this total number of lost cells is equal to the entire population of the villus, $N_{v}$.\n$$N_{v} = R_{loss} \\times t$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the rate of loss:\n$$R_{loss} = \\frac{N_{v}}{t}$$\nCombining this with the steady-state equation, we find the required rate of production:\n$$R_{prod} = \\frac{N_{v}}{t}$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Villus enterocyte population, $N_{v} = 10^{4}$ cells.\n- Epithelial turnover time, $t = 4$ days.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$R_{prod} = \\frac{10^{4} \\text{ cells}}{4 \\text{ days}} = 2500 \\text{ cells/day}$$\n\nThe problem also provides the number of active stem cells, $N_{s} = 6$. This information is not required to calculate the *total* proliferative output of the crypt, but it would be necessary to determine the average output rate per stem cell. Since the question asks for the total output for the crypt, $N_{s}$ is extraneous information for this specific calculation.\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $2500$. To express this with three significant figures, it is best written in scientific notation.\n$$2500 = 2.50 \\times 10^{3}$$\n\nThe additional simplifications adopted, as requested, are explicitly those given or implied by the problem statement:\n$1$. The system is in a perfect steady state where production and loss rates are constant and precisely balanced.\n$2$. The enterocyte population is the only one considered for the turnover calculation, consistent with the statement that it is the \"predominant\" cell type. The contributions of other cell types (e.g., Goblet cells, Paneth cells, enteroendocrine cells) to the total cell flux are considered negligible for this model.\n$3$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of cell biology and employs standard, albeit simplified, mathematical models for cell division and migration. The data provided are self-contained, consistent, and biologically plausible. The problem is well-posed and objective.\n\nThe solution is approached in two parts, as requested by the problem.\n\n**Part 1: Fractional EdU Label as a Function of Time**\n\nThe first task is to derive the fractional EdU label per nucleus as a function of time. We are given two key assumptions:\n1. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication is semi-conservative.\n2. Labeled chromatids segregate equally during mitosis.\n\nLet $L(t)$ represent the amount of EdU-labeled DNA in a single cell nucleus at time $t$. At the beginning of the chase period, $t=0$, the initial amount of label in a cell that has just completed S-phase is $L_0$.\n\nAccording to the principle of semi-conservative replication, after one round of DNA replication and cell division, the original labeled DNA is distributed equally between the two daughter cells. Therefore, after one completed cell cycle, the amount of label in each daughter nucleus is $\\frac{1}{2} L_0$. After a second completed cell cycle, the label in each of the four granddaughter nuclei will be $\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} L_0\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 L_0$.\n\nGeneralizing this, after $n$ completed cell divisions, the amount of label per nucleus will be:\n$$ L(t) = L_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n $$\nThe fractional label, which we denote as $F(t)$, is the ratio of the label at time $t$ to the initial label $L_0$.\n$$ F(t) = \\frac{L(t)}{L_0} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n $$\nThe number of completed cell divisions, $n$, that have occurred by time $t$ depends on the cell cycle time, $t_c$. The total number of cycles elapsed is the ratio $t/t_c$. Since cell division is a discrete event, the number of *completed* divisions is the integer part of this ratio, which is mathematically represented by the floor function.\n$$ n = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{t}{t_c} \\right\\rfloor $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the fractional label gives the desired function of time:\n$$ F(t) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\lfloor t/t_c \\rfloor} $$\nWe are asked to evaluate this function at $t = 48\\ \\mathrm{h}$, given a cell cycle time of $t_c = 24\\ \\mathrm{h}$. It is a biological simplification to assume cells continue to divide with this cycle time after leaving the crypt, but this is implied by the problem's formulation. First, we calculate the number of completed cell divisions:\n$$ n = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{48\\ \\mathrm{h}}{24\\ \\mathrm{h}} \\right\\rfloor = \\lfloor 2 \\rfloor = 2 $$\nTwo complete cell divisions have occurred. Now, we calculate the fractional label at this time:\n$$ F(48\\ \\mathrm{h}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25 $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the fractional label is $0.250$.\n\n**Part 2: Position of the Labeled Cohort**\n\nThe second task is to derive the position of the labeled cohort as a function of time. The problem assumes that the average position, $x$, can be modeled by uniform motion with a constant speed, $v$. This is expressed by the differential equation:\n$$ v = \\frac{dx}{dt} $$\nTo find the position $x(t)$, we integrate this equation with respect to time. We can separate variables:\n$$ dx = v \\, dt $$\nWe integrate from the initial condition $(t=0, x=x(0))$ to an arbitrary time $t$:\n$$ \\int_{x(0)}^{x(t)} dx' = \\int_{0}^{t} v \\, dt' $$\nSince the migration rate $v$ is constant, the integration yields:\n$$ [x']_{x(0)}^{x(t)} = v [t']_{0}^{t} $$\n$$ x(t) - x(0) = v(t - 0) $$\nThe problem states that at time $t=0$, the labeled cohort is at the crypt-villus junction, which corresponds to the position $x(0)=0$. Substituting this initial condition, we obtain the equation for the position of the cohort:\n$$ x(t) = vt $$\nWe are asked to evaluate the position at $t = 48\\ \\mathrm{h}$. The migration rate is given as $v = 0.25\\ \\mathrm{mm}/\\mathrm{day}$. We must use consistent units for time.
