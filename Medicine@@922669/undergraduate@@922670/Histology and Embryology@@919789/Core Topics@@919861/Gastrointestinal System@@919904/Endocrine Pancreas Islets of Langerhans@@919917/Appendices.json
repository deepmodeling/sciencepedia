A pan-endocrine marker such as Chromogranin A (CgA) labels all endocrine cells, allowing the total endocrine cell count in the islet to be established. Immunostaining with cell-type-specific markers reveals relative fractions of cells that are positive for a given hormone, and by the additivity of counts for disjoint subsets, the sum of the counts of identified cell types plus any residual unidentified endocrine cells equals the total endocrine cell count. The residual represents PP and epsilon cells when only insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin markers are used.\n\nStarting from the principles of disjoint set additivity in counting, the interpretation of immunostaining fractions as proportions of the total endocrine cell population, and the conservation of total endocrine cell number under pan-endocrine labeling, consider an islet with a total of $N = 1000$ endocrine cells (established by Chromogranin A staining). Specific immunostaining shows $55\\%$ insulin-positive, $35\\%$ glucagon-positive, and $10\\%$ somatostatin-positive endocrine cells. \n\nTasks:\n1. Compute the counts of insulin-positive (beta), glucagon-positive (alpha), and somatostatin-positive (delta) cells.\n2. Using the principles above, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the residual count of PP plus epsilon cells as a function of the total endocrine cell count and the measured fractions of insulin-, glucagon-, and somatostatin-positive cells. Denote these fractions by $f_{\\beta}$, $f_{\\alpha}$, and $f_{\\delta}$, respectively, and the total endocrine cell count by $N$. This residual expression formalizes the criterion for whether PP and epsilon cells must be resolved with additional markers (i.e., whether the residual is nonzero).\n\nExpress the final answer as the single closed-form analytic expression for the residual PP-plus-epsilon cell count $R(N,f_{\\beta},f_{\\alpha},f_{\\delta})$ in terms of $N$, $f_{\\beta}$, $f_{\\alpha}$, and $f_{\\delta}$.", "solution": "The core principle is the conservation of the total number of cells, based on the additivity of counts for disjoint (non-overlapping) populations. Let $\\mathcal{E}$ be the total set of endocrine cells in the islet, with cardinality $|\\mathcal{E}| = N$. This set is partitioned into five disjoint subsets: beta ($\\beta$), alpha ($\\alpha$), delta ($\\delta$), pancreatic polypeptide (PP), and epsilon ($\\epsilon$) cells. Let $N_{\\beta}$, $N_{\\alpha}$, $N_{\\delta}$, $N_{PP}$, and $N_{\\epsilon}$ be the number of cells in each respective subset.\n\nBecause these subsets are disjoint and their union constitutes the entire endocrine population, we have:\n$$N = N_{\\beta} + N_{\\alpha} + N_{\\delta} + N_{PP} + N_{\\epsilon}$$\nThe problem defines a residual population, $R$, which corresponds to the cells not identified by the insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin markers. This residual population is the sum of PP and epsilon cells. The count of residual cells is therefore $N_{R} = N_{PP} + N_{\\epsilon}$. We will denote this count by $R$ as requested. The conservation equation can be rewritten as:\n$$N = N_{\\beta} + N_{\\alpha} + N_{\\delta} + R$$\n\nThe fractions $f_{\\beta}$, $f_{\\alpha}$, and $f_{\\delta}$ are given as proportions of the total endocrine cell count, $N$. Thus, the absolute number of cells for each identified type is:\n$$N_{\\beta} = f_{\\beta} N$$\n$$N_{\\alpha} = f_{\\alpha} N$$\n$$N_{\\delta} = f_{\\delta} N$$\n\n**Task 1: Compute specific cell counts.**\nGiven the total cell count $N = 1000$ and the fractions $f_{\\beta} = 55\\% = 0.55$, $f_{\\alpha} = 35\\% = 0.35$, and $f_{\\delta} = 10\\% = 0.10$.\n\nThe number of insulin-positive (beta) cells is:\n$$N_{\\beta} = 0.55 \\times 1000 = 550$$\nThe number of glucagon-positive (alpha) cells is:\n$$N_{\\alpha} = 0.35 \\times 1000 = 350$$\nThe number of somatostatin-positive (delta) cells is:\n$$N_{\\delta} = 0.10 \\times 1000 = 100$$\nThe sum of these identified cell counts is $N_{\\beta} + N_{\\alpha} + N_{\\delta} = 550 + 350 + 100 = 1000$. This matches the total cell count $N$, which implies for this specific numerical example, the residual count $R$ is $0$.\n\n**Task 2: Derive the general expression for the residual count.**\nWe start from the cell conservation equation:\n$$N = N_{\\beta} + N_{\\alpha} + N_{\\delta} + R$$\nTo find the expression for the residual count $R$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$R = N - (N_{\\beta} + N_{\\alpha} + N_{\\delta})$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $N_{\\beta}$, $N_{\\alpha}$, and $N_{\\delta}$ in terms of their respective fractions and the total count $N$:\n$$R = N - (f_{\\beta} N + f_{\\alpha} N + f_{\\delta} N)$$\nFactoring $N$ from the terms in the parenthesis gives:\n$$R = N - N(f_{\\beta} + f_{\\alpha} + f_{\\delta})$$\nFinally, we can factor $N$ out of the entire expression to obtain the closed-form analytic expression for the residual count as a function of $N$, $f_{\\beta}$, $f_{\\alpha}$, and $f_{\\delta}$:\n$$R(N, f_{\\beta}, f_{\\alpha}, f_{\\delta}) = N(1 - (f_{\\beta} + f_{\\alpha} + f_{\\delta}))$$\nThis can be written more simply as:\n$$R(N, f_{\\beta}, f_{\\alpha}, f_{\\delta}) = N(1 - f_{\\beta} - f_{\\alpha} - f_{\\delta})$$\nThis expression formalizes the principle that the residual count is the total count multiplied by the fraction of cells not accounted for by the initial set of markers. If the sum of the measured fractions $f_{\\beta} + f_{\\alpha} + f_{\\delta}$ is less than $1$, the residual $R$ will be non-zero, indicating the presence of other endocrine cell types (PP and epsilon cells) that require additional markers for their identification and quantification.
