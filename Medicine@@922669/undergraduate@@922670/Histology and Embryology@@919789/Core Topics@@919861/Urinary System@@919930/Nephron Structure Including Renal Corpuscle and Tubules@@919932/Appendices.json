The nephron consists of a renal corpuscle (glomerulus and Bowman’s capsule) and a tubular system, with juxtamedullary nephrons characterized by long loops of Henle and cortical nephrons by shorter loops. Whole-kidney Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) was measured by inulin clearance. The following data are obtained: a combined Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) of $118$ mL/min for both kidneys, a combined kidney weight of $310$ g, and a stereological estimate of $1.9 \\times 10^{6}$ functioning nephrons in total.

Then, based on histological principles of nephron architecture and countercurrent systems, analyze qualitatively how increasing the juxtamedullary proportion from $0.20$ to $0.30$ would be expected to influence maximal urinary concentrating capacity, assuming the mean filtration per nephron in the cortex is unchanged.\n\nExpress the final numeric value for the single-nephron GFR in nL/min and round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires a two-part response: first, the calculation of the average single-nephron Glomerular Filtration Rate (sNGFR), and second, a qualitative analysis of the effect of changing the proportion of juxtamedullary nephrons on urinary concentrating capacity.\n\nPart 1: Calculation of Average Single-Nephron GFR (sNGFR)\n\nThe fundamental premise, as stated in the problem, is that the total whole-kidney Glomerular Filtration Rate ($GFR_{total}$) is the aggregate of the filtration rates of all individual functioning nephrons. The average sNGFR is therefore the total GFR divided by the total number of nephrons ($N_{total}$).\n\nLet $GFR_{total}$ be the total glomerular filtration rate and $N_{total}$ be the total number of nephrons. The average single-nephron GFR, denoted as $\\text{sNGFR}_{avg}$, is defined by the relation:\n$$ \\text{sNGFR}_{avg} = \\frac{GFR_{total}}{N_{total}} $$\n\nThe given values are:\n- $GFR_{total} = 118$ mL/min\n- $N_{total} = 1.9 \\times 10^{6}$ nephrons\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be in units of nanoliters per minute (nL/min). Therefore, a unit conversion for $GFR_{total}$ is necessary. We use the following conversion factors:\n- $1$ milliliter (mL) is equivalent to $10^{-3}$ liters (L).\n- $1$ nanoliter (nL) is equivalent to $10^{-9}$ liters (L).\n\nFrom these, we can derive the conversion from mL to nL:\n$$ \\frac{1 \\text{ mL}}{1 \\text{ nL}} = \\frac{10^{-3} \\text{ L}}{10^{-9} \\text{ L}} = 10^{6} $$\nThus, $1 \\text{ mL} = 10^6 \\text{ nL}$.\n\nNow, we convert the value of $GFR_{total}$ to the required units:\n$$ GFR_{total} = 118 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} \\times \\frac{10^6 \\text{ nL}}{1 \\text{ mL}} = 118 \\times 10^6 \\frac{\\text{nL}}{\\text{min}} = 1.18 \\times 10^8 \\frac{\\text{nL}}{\\text{min}} $$\n\nWith the total GFR expressed in the correct units, we can now calculate the average sNGFR:\n$$ \\text{sNGFR}_{avg} = \\frac{1.18 \\times 10^8 \\text{ nL/min}}{1.9 \\times 10^{6}} $$\n$$ \\text{sNGFR}_{avg} = \\frac{1.18}{1.9} \\times 10^{(8-6)} \\frac{\\text{nL}}{\\text{min}} $$\n$$ \\text{sNGFR}_{avg} = \\frac{1.18}{1.9} \\times 10^2 \\frac{\\text{nL}}{\\text{min}} $$\n\nPerforming the division:\n$$ \\frac{1.18}{1.9} \\approx 0.62105263... $$\n\nSubstituting this value back into the equation:\n$$ \\text{sNGFR}_{avg} \\approx 0.62105263 \\times 100 \\frac{\\text{nL}}{\\text{min}} \\approx 62.105263 \\frac{\\text{nL}}{\\text{min}} $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\text{sNGFR}_{avg} \\approx 62.11 \\frac{\\text{nL}}{\\text{min}} $$\nThis value is physiologically reasonable, as sNGFR in humans typically ranges from $40$ to $80$ nL/min. The additional data point of combined kidney weight ($310$ g) is not required for this calculation.\n\nPart 2: Qualitative Analysis of Urinary Concentrating Capacity\n\nThe maximal urinary concentrating capacity is determined by the magnitude of the corticomedullary osmotic gradient. This gradient is established and maintained by the countercurrent multiplier system, a function primarily attributed to the anatomical arrangement of the loops of Henle and vasa recta of juxtamedullary nephrons.\n\n1.  **Role of Nephron Subtypes:** The kidney contains two main subtypes of nephrons: cortical nephrons, with short loops of Henle that penetrate only the outer medulla or remain in the cortex, and juxtamedullary nephrons, which possess long loops of Henle that descend deep into the inner medulla.\n\n2.  **The Countercurrent Multiplier:** The generation of the hyperosmotic medullary interstitium relies on the countercurrent multiplier mechanism. This process involves the active transport of solutes (primarily $\\text{NaCl}$) out of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle into the surrounding interstitium. Because this limb is impermeable to water, the active transport of solutes effectively dilutes the tubular fluid while concentrating the interstitial fluid. The long loops of juxtamedullary nephrons are crucial because they extend deep into the medulla, allowing for the multiplication effect to establish a steep osmotic gradient, with osmolality increasing from approximately $300$ mOsm/kg in the cortex to as high as $1200\\text{–}1400$ mOsm/kg in the papillary tip.\n\n3.  **Effect of Increased Juxtamedullary Proportion:** The problem posits an increase in the proportion of juxtamedullary nephrons from $0.20$ to $0.30$. This represents a $50\\%$ increase in the relative number of nephrons that possess long loops of Henle. A greater number of these long loops means a greater capacity for active solute transport into the deep medulla. This enhanced solute pumping capacity would lead to a more efficient and powerful countercurrent multiplier system.\n\n4.  **Consequence for Urinary Concentration:** A more powerful countercurrent multiplier would generate a steeper corticomedullary osmotic gradient, resulting in a higher maximal osmolality in the deep medullary interstitium. The maximal concentrating ability of the kidney depends on this gradient. In the presence of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which increases the water permeability of the principal cells in the collecting ducts, a higher interstitial osmolality provides a greater driving force for osmotic water reabsorption from the tubular fluid as it flows through the medullary collecting ducts.\n\nTherefore, increasing the proportion of juxtamedullary nephrons from $0.20$ to $0.30$ would be expected to enhance the kidney's ability to create a hyperosmotic medullary interstitium. This, in turn, would increase the maximal urinary concentrating capacity, allowing the subject to produce a smaller volume of more highly concentrated urine when necessary to conserve water. The assumption that mean filtration per nephron in the cortex is unchanged serves to isolate this structural effect from confounding functional changes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{62.11}$$", "id": "4918416"}]}
