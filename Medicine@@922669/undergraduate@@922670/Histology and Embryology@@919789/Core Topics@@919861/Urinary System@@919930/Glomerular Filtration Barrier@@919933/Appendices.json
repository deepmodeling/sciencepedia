The glomerular filtration barrier comprises fenestrated endothelium, a trilaminar glomerular basement membrane, and podocyte slit diaphragms; its size- and charge-selective properties can be summarized by an effective protein reflection coefficient $\\sigma$ that takes the value $\\sigma=1$ when proteins are effectively excluded from the filtrate. Under steady-state conditions, fluid flux across a semipermeable barrier is proportional to the overall filtration coefficient $K_f$ and the net driving pressure, which consists of hydrostatic forces opposed by the effective oncotic difference across the barrier. The glomerular capillary (GC) hydrostatic pressure is denoted $P_{GC}$, the Bowman's space (BS) hydrostatic pressure is $P_{BS}$, the glomerular capillary oncotic pressure is $\\pi_{GC}$, and the Bowman's space oncotic pressure is $\\pi_{BS}$. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the volumetric flow of filtrate into Bowman's space arising from this fluid flux integrated over the filtration surface.\n\nStarting from these principles and definitions, determine the numerical change in GFR when the glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure $P_{GC}$ is increased by $5$ mmHg from its baseline, assuming that $K_f$ and the oncotic pressures remain unchanged and that $\\sigma=1$.
