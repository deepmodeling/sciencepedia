By calculating the change in circumferential (hoop) stress during nerve swelling, you will gain a tangible understanding of the epineurium's role in maintaining nerve architecture against internal pressure changes.", "problem": "A peripheral nerve trunk can be idealized as a thin-walled cylindrical pressure vessel whose outer connective tissue sheath, the epineurium, bears the circumferential (hoop) stress generated by internal endoneurial fluid pressure. Consider a straight segment of nerve of unit length whose initial outer diameter is $4.0$ millimeters and whose epineurial wall thickness is $0.20$ millimeters. The internal pressure is uniform and constant at $2.0$ kilopascals, and the segment’s length does not change. Suppose the outer diameter increases by $0.10$ times its initial value due to intraneural swelling. Assume the epineurium carries the hoop load and the perineurium and endoneurium contribute only to internal pressure generation.\n\nStarting from static force balance on an axially bisected cylindrical segment and the definition of normal stress as force per area, derive the thin-wall expression for circumferential stress in terms of internal pressure, cylinder radius, and wall thickness. Then, compute the absolute change in circumferential stress when the diameter increases by $0.10$ times its initial value under the following two assumptions about epineurial wall thickness:\n- Assumption A: The epineurial thickness remains constant.\n- Assumption B: The epineurial material is effectively incompressible over the timescale considered, so the epineurial cross-sectional area per unit length is conserved, implying the relationship $\\pi(R^{2}-(R-t)^{2})$ is constant before and after swelling, where $R$ is the outer radius and $t$ is the epineurial thickness.\n\nExpress your final answers as a row matrix containing the two stress changes corresponding to Assumption A and Assumption B, in kilopascals, rounding each entry to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Initial outer diameter: $d_i = 4.0$ millimeters\n- Initial epineurial wall thickness: $t_i = 0.20$ millimeters\n- Internal pressure (uniform and constant): $P = 2.0$ kilopascals\n- Length of the nerve segment is constant.\n- Change in outer diameter: An increase of $0.10$ times its initial value.\n- Assumption A: Epineurial thickness remains constant ($t$ is constant).\n- Assumption B: Epineurial material is incompressible, leading to conservation of epineurial cross-sectional area.

The problem is therefore scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of Circumferential Stress Expression\nThe circumferential stress, or hoop stress ($\\sigma_h$), in the wall of a cylinder is found by considering the static equilibrium of forces on an axially bisected segment. Let the cylinder have an outer radius $R$, an inner radius $r_{in}$, a wall thickness $t = R - r_{in}$, and a length $L$. The internal pressure $P$ exerts an outward force on the internal surfaces.\n\nConsider a free-body diagram of the top half of the cylindrical segment. The total upward force, $F_P$, due to the internal pressure is equal to the pressure $P$ multiplied by the projected area onto the horizontal plane, which is a rectangle of dimensions $2r_{in} \\times L$.\n$$F_P = P \\times (2r_{in} \\times L)$$\nThis bursting force is resisted by the tensile stress in the cylinder wall. The resisting force, $F_{\\sigma}$, is the circumferential stress $\\sigma_h$ acting on the two cut sections of the wall. The area of each cut section is $t \\times L$.\n$$F_{\\sigma} = \\sigma_h \\times (2 \\times t \\times L)$$\nFor static equilibrium, the forces must balance: $F_P = F_{\\sigma}$.\n$$P \\cdot 2r_{in} \\cdot L = \\sigma_h \\cdot 2t \\cdot L$$\nSolving for $\\sigma_h$, we get:\n$$\\sigma_h = \\frac{P r_{in}}{t}$$\nThe problem provides the outer radius $R$ and thickness $t$. The inner radius is $r_{in} = R - t$. Substituting this into the expression gives the average circumferential stress in terms of the outer radius:\n$$\\sigma_h = \\frac{P(R-t)}{t} = P\\left(\\frac{R}{t} - 1\\right)$$\nThis is the expression we will use for the calculations. The problem mentions a \"thin-walled\" cylinder, for which the condition $R/t \\ge 10$ is typically used. In our initial state, $R_i/t_i = (4.0/2)/0.20 = 2.0/0.20 = 10$, so the model is appropriate.\n\n### Calculation of Stress Change\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial circumferential stress, $\\sigma_{h,i}$.\n- Initial outer radius: $R_i = \\frac{d_i}{2} = \\frac{4.0 \\text{ mm}}{2} = 2.0 \\text{ mm}$.\n- Initial wall thickness: $t_i = 0.20 \\text{ mm}$.\n- Internal pressure: $P = 2.0 \\text{ kPa}$.\n\n$$\\sigma_{h,i} = P\\left(\\frac{R_i}{t_i} - 1\\right) = (2.0 \\text{ kPa})\\left(\\frac{2.0 \\text{ mm}}{0.20 \\text{ mm}} - 1\\right) = 2.0 \\times (10 - 1) = 18.0 \\text{ kPa}$$\n\nNext, we determine the final outer radius, $R_f$. The diameter increases by $0.10$ times its initial value.\n- Final outer diameter: $d_f = d_i \\times (1 + 0.10) = 4.0 \\text{ mm} \\times 1.1 = 4.4 \\text{ mm}$.\n- Final outer radius: $R_f = \\frac{d_f}{2} = 2.2 \\text{ mm}$.\n\nNow we compute the final stress and the change in stress for each assumption.\n\n#### Assumption A: Constant Thickness\nThe wall thickness is assumed to remain constant: $t_f = t_i = 0.20 \\text{ mm}$.\nThe final stress, $\\sigma_{h,f,A}$, is:\n$$\\sigma_{h,f,A} = P\\left(\\frac{R_f}{t_f} - 1\\right) = (2.0 \\text{ kPa})\\left(\\frac{2.2 \\text{ mm}}{0.20 \\text{ mm}} - 1\\right) = 2.0 \\times (11 - 1) = 20.0 \\text{ kPa}$$\nThe absolute change in stress for Assumption A is:\n$$\\Delta\\sigma_{h,A} = \\sigma_{h,f,A} - \\sigma_{h,i} = 20.0 \\text{ kPa} - 18.0 \\text{ kPa} = 2.0 \\text{ kPa}$$\n\n#### Assumption B: Conserved Epineurial Cross-Sectional Area\nThe cross-sectional area of the epineurium, $A_{cs}$, is conserved. The area is given by $A_{cs} = \\pi(R^2 - r_{in}^2) = \\pi(R^2 - (R-t)^2) = \\pi(2Rt - t^2)$.\nThus, $A_{cs,i} = A_{cs,f}$, which implies:\n$$2R_i t_i - t_i^2 = 2R_f t_f - t_f^2$$\nWe first calculate the value of the conserved quantity (divided by $\\pi$):\n$$2R_i t_i - t_i^2 = 2(2.0)(0.20) - (0.20)^2 = 0.80 - 0.04 = 0.76 \\text{ mm}^2$$\nNow we set up a quadratic equation for the final thickness, $t_f$:\n$$2R_f t_f - t_f^2 = 0.76$$\n$$t_f^2 - 2(2.2)t_f + 0.76 = 0$$\n$$t_f^2 - 4.4t_f + 0.76 = 0$$\nUsing the quadratic formula, $t_f = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$t_f = \\frac{4.4 \\pm \\sqrt{(-4.4)^2 - 4(1)(0.76)}}{2} = \\frac{4.4 \\pm \\sqrt{19.36 - 3.04}}{2} = \\frac{4.4 \\pm \\sqrt{16.32}}{2}$$\nThe two potential solutions are $t_f \\approx \\frac{4.4 + 4.0398}{2} \\approx 4.22 \\text{ mm}$ and $t_f \\approx \\frac{4.4 - 4.0398}{2} \\approx 0.1801 \\text{ mm}$. The first solution is physically impossible as the thickness would be greater than the radius ($R_f=2.2$ mm). Therefore, the correct final thickness is:\n$$t_f \\approx 0.180099 \\text{ mm}$$\nNow we compute the final stress, $\\sigma_{h,f,B}$:\n$$\\sigma_{h,f,B} = P\\left(\\frac{R_f}{t_f} - 1\\right) = (2.0 \\text{ kPa})\\left(\\frac{2.2 \\text{ mm}}{0.180099 \\text{ mm}} - 1\\right)$$\n$$\\sigma_{h,f,B} \\approx 2.0 \\times (12.2155 - 1) = 2.0 \\times 11.2155 = 22.431 \\text{ kPa}$$\nThe absolute change in stress for Assumption B is:\n$$\\Delta\\sigma_{h,B} = \\sigma_{h,f,B} - \\sigma_{h,i} = 22.431 \\text{ kPa} - 18.0 \\text{ kPa} = 4.431 \\text{ kPa}$$\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\nThe problem requires the two stress changes, $\\Delta\\sigma_{h,A}$ and $\\Delta\\sigma_{h,B}$, in kilopascals, rounded to three significant figures.\n- For Assumption A: $\\Delta\\sigma_{h,A} = 2.0 \\text{ kPa}$. To three significant figures, this is $2.00 \\text{ kPa}$.\n- For Assumption B: $\\Delta\\sigma_{h,B} = 4.431 \\text{ kPa}$.

The rate of change of the mass of solute, $M_f$, within the fascicle volume $V_f$ is equal to the rate at which solute diffuses across the perineurium. The mass of solute in the fascicle is $M_f(t) = V_f C_f(t)$.

The problem provides the final form of these expressions, so the task is to justify them based on the provided physical model.\n\nThe net ionic current, $I_{\\text{net}}$, flowing across the nodal membrane at any given membrane potential, $V_m$, is the sum of the currents carried by the individual ion channels. The problem models the node with three effective conductances: sodium ($g_{\\text{Na}}$), potassium ($g_{\\text{K}}$), and leak ($g_{L}$). The current through each channel type follows a form of Ohm's law, where the current is the product of the conductance and the electrochemical driving force. The driving force for an ion species $X$ is the difference between the membrane potential $V_m$ and the ion's Nernst equilibrium potential $E_X$. Thus, $I_X = g_X(V_m - E_X)$.

Substituting the expressions for $\\Delta Q$ and $I_{\\text{arriving}}$ gives:\n$$\\Delta t = \\frac{C_{\\text{node}} \\Delta V}{|I_{\\text{net}}| \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d}{\\lambda}\\right)}$$\nThe propagation velocity is the internodal distance divided by this time delay: $v = \\frac{d}{\\Delta t}$. Substituting for $\\Delta t$ yields the expression provided in the problem:\n$$v = \\frac{d}{\\frac{C_{\\text{node}} \\Delta V}{|I_{\\text{net}}| \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d}{\\lambda}\\right)}} = \\frac{d\\,|I_{\\text{net}}|\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{d}{\\lambda}\\right)}{C_{\\text{node}}\\,\\Delta V}$$\n\nNow, we proceed to compute the conduction velocity after the edema episode, $v_{\\text{edema}}$.\n\n**1.

Simultaneously, the dilution of extracellular potassium makes the potassium equilibrium potential, $E_{\\text{K}}$, more negative, increasing the outward driving force for $\\text{K}^+$. Both effects combine to reduce the net inward current available to charge the next node, resulting in a slower conduction velocity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.148}$$", "id": "4922628"}]}
