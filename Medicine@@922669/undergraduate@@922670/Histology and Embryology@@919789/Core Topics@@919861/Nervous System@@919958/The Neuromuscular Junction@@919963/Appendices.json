This exercise provides a practical application of this theory, allowing you to calculate the quantal content—the number of neurotransmitter vesicles released by a single nerve impulse—by comparing the size of the response to the size of a single quantum [@problem_id:2353164].", "problem": "A team of cellular neurobiologists is studying synaptic transmission at a model synapse, the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). They are investigating how a specific experimental condition affects the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Using an intracellular microelectrode placed in a postsynaptic muscle cell, they perform two types of measurements.\n\nFirst, by stimulating the presynaptic motor nerve, they evoke a large depolarization in the muscle cell. This response is called the End-Plate Potential (EPP). The average amplitude of the EPPs recorded under their experimental setup is 27.6 mV.\n\nSecond, in the absence of any stimulation to the motor nerve, they record small, spontaneous fluctuations in the muscle cell's membrane potential. These are known as miniature End-Plate Potentials (mEPPs), which are understood to be the postsynaptic response to the release of a single quantum (one synaptic vesicle's worth) of acetylcholine. The mean amplitude of the observed mEPPs is 0.46 mV.\n\nAssuming the quantal hypothesis, which states that an EPP is the sum of many individual quantal events, calculate the quantal content for this synapse under these conditions. The quantal content is defined as the average number of vesicles released from the presynaptic terminal in response to a single nerve impulse.", "solution": "Under the quantal hypothesis, the mean End-Plate Potential (EPP) amplitude equals the product of the quantal content and the mean miniature EPP (mEPP) amplitude. Denoting the quantal content by $m$, the mean EPP amplitude by $\\langle A_{\\mathrm{EPP}}\\rangle$, and the mean mEPP amplitude (quantal size) by $q=\\langle A_{\\mathrm{mEPP}}\\rangle$, we have:\n$$\n\\langle A_{\\mathrm{EPP}}\\rangle = m\\,q \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad m = \\frac{\\langle A_{\\mathrm{EPP}}\\rangle}{q}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given values, with units canceling:\n$$\nm = \\frac{27.6\\ \\mathrm{mV}}{0.46\\ \\mathrm{mV}} = \\frac{27.6}{0.46}.\n$$\nCompute the ratio explicitly:\n$$\n\\frac{27.6}{0.46} = \\frac{2760}{46} = 60.\n$$\nThus, the quantal content is $60$ vesicles per nerve impulse.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{60}$$", "id": "2353164"}, {"introduction": "The end-plate potential arises from ions flowing through acetylcholine-gated channels, but what determines the direction and magnitude of this flow? This depends on the driving force for each ion and a special voltage called the reversal potential, where the net current is zero.

The nAChR is a ligand-gated ion channel permeable to both sodium ($Na^{+}$) and potassium ($K^{+}$) ions.\n\nAn electrophysiologist conducts an experiment using a voltage clamp, a device that holds the membrane potential ($V_m$) of the muscle fiber constant while measuring the resulting current flow across the membrane. The experiment is designed to investigate the properties of the end-plate current (EPC), which is the total current flowing through all the open nAChR channels.\n\nThe reversal potential ($E_{rev}$) for the EPC is defined as the unique membrane potential at which the net flow of charge through the open nAChR channels is zero.

Only $Na^{+}$ ions will flow into the cell, as the driving force for $K^{+}$ is zero at this potential.\n\nD.
