The fundamental principle governing this process is the conservation of cell flux across the different zones of the growth plate.\n\nLet us define the relevant parameters provided:\n- The division rate of proliferative chondrocytes is $p = 0.2 \\, \\text{divisions/day per cell}$.\n- The number of proliferative chondrocytes in a column is $L_{p} = 10$.\n- The average height of a proliferative chondrocyte is $a = 12 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$.\n- The fold change in height upon hypertrophy is $h = 4$.\n- The conversion efficiency from cartilage to bone is $e = 0.9$.\n\nOur derivation begins from first principles, starting with the proliferative zone. The total rate of new cell production in a single column is the product of the number of proliferative cells and the division rate per cell. We denote this cell flux as $\\Phi_{\\text{cell}}$.\n\nIn a steady-state system, for each division, one daughter cell effectively exits the proliferative zone to enter the hypertrophic zone, while the other remains to maintain the proliferative population. Thus, the flux of cells leaving the proliferative zone and entering the hypertrophic zone is:\n$$\n\\Phi_{\\text{cell}} = p \\cdot L_{p}\n$$\n\nThese cells then undergo hypertrophy. A single proliferative chondrocyte has a height of $a$. Upon hypertrophy, its height increases by a factor of $h$. The height of a single hypertrophic chondrocyte, $a_{h}$, is therefore:\n$$\na_{h} = h \\cdot a\n$$\n\nThe total contribution to the length of the column from the newly hypertrophied cells is the number of cells becoming hypertrophic per day ($\\Phi_{\\text{cell}}$) multiplied by the height of each of these cells ($a_{h}$). This gives the rate of elongation of the cartilage template, which we denote as $R_{\\text{cartilage}}$.\n$$\nR_{\\text{cartilage}} = \\Phi_{\\text{cell}} \\cdot a_{h} = (p \\cdot L_{p}) \\cdot (h \\cdot a)\n$$\n\nThis newly formed cartilage matrix serves as a scaffold for bone formation. The problem states that the conversion efficiency, $e$, represents the fraction of this hypertrophic cartilage length that is ultimately realized as new bone length. This factor accounts for the complex remodeling processes where the cartilage is resorbed and replaced by bone tissue, which may involve some volume or length change. The daily bone elongation per column, which we denote as $R_{\\text{bone}}$, is therefore:\n$$\nR_{\\text{bone}} = e \\cdot R_{\\text{cartilage}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $R_{\\text{cartilage}}$, we arrive at the final derived expression for the daily bone elongation:\n$$\nR_{\\text{bone}} = e \\cdot p \\cdot L_{p} \\cdot h \\cdot a\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided in the problem statement into this expression:\n$$\nR_{\\text{bone}} = (0.9) \\cdot (0.2 \\, \\text{day}^{-1}) \\cdot (10) \\cdot (4) \\cdot (12 \\, \\mu\\text{m})\n$$\n\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$\nR_{\\text{bone}} = (0.9 \\cdot 0.2 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 12) \\, \\frac{\\mu\\text{m}}{\\text{day}}\n$$\n$$\nR_{\\text{bone}} = (0.18 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 12) \\, \\frac{\\mu\\text{m}}{\\text{day}}\n$$\n$$\nR_{\\text{bone}} = (1.8 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 12) \\, \\frac{\\mu\\text{m}}{\\text{day}}\n$$\n$$\nR_{\\text{bone}} = (7.2 \\cdot 12) \\, \\frac{\\mu\\text{m}}{\\text{day}}\n$$\n$$\nR_{\\text{bone}} = 86.4 \\, \\frac{\\mu\\text{m}}{\\text{day}}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be in millimeters per day (mm/day).
