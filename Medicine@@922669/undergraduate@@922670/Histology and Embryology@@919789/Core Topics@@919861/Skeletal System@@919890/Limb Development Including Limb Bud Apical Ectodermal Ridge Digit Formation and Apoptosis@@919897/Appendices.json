This process often involves complex molecular networks that behave as reaction-diffusion systems, spontaneously generating periodic patterns. This practice problem simplifies this intricate process into an elegant and powerful principle: the number of digits that form is determined by how many \"wavelengths\" of a chemical pre-pattern can fit across the width of the limb bud. By exploring a hypothetical scenario where limb development is perturbed, you will see how changes in limb bud size and pattern spacing can directly alter digit number, offering insight into both congenital malformations and the evolutionary diversification of limbs [@problem_id:4910564].", "problem": "A limb bud can be idealized as a rectangular field of mesenchyme under the influence of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), which secretes fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), and the posterior zone of polarizing activity (ZPA), which secretes Sonic hedgehog (SHH). Within this field, chondrogenic condensations that prefigure digits emerge as a periodic prepattern produced by an activator–inhibitor reaction–diffusion system involving, among others, Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling and transcription factor SRY-Box Transcription Factor 9 (Sox9). A robust and well-tested observation for such systems is that the pattern exhibits a characteristic spacing (wavelength) between adjacent condensations, denoted by $\\lambda$, so that over a span $W$ (the limb bud width along the anterior–posterior axis), the number of condensations is set by how many full spacings of size $\\lambda$ can fit between the posterior and anterior margins. Assume that the pattern initiates at the posterior margin and proceeds anteriorly, and that any incomplete spacing at the anterior margin does not form a stable condensation due to boundary constraints and growth dynamics. Interdigital tissue apoptosis sculpts the spaces between condensations but, in the normal setting considered here, does not change the number of condensations that successfully form.\n\nAt a defined developmental stage, the limb bud width is $W_{0} = 2.35$ mm, and the measured characteristic spacing is $\\lambda_{0} = 0.47$ mm. A stage-specific partial AER ablation reduces mesenchymal proliferation and outgrowth, leading to an $8\\%$ decrease in width (so the new width is $W_{1} = (1 - 0.08) W_{0}$), and, through shifting the BMP–FGF balance, increases the characteristic spacing by $10\\%$ (so the new spacing is $\\lambda_{1} = (1 + 0.10) \\lambda_{0}$). Interdigital programmed cell death remains normal, so each condensation that forms yields a distinct digit.\n\nStarting from these foundational facts and definitions, and using only the concept that a periodic pattern with spacing $\\lambda$ packs one condensation per full spacing across width $W$, determine:\n- the expected baseline number of condensations $n_{0}$ that fit across $W_{0}$, and\n- the expected number of condensations after the perturbation, $n_{1}$, across $W_{1}$ with spacing $\\lambda_{1}$,\n\ntaking into account that only full spacings count as condensations.
