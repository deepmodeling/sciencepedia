The outer boundary of the osteon is the cement line. Spongy bone organizes lamellae within trabeculae rather than concentric osteons, but the geometric principles of lamellar stacking apply to both; here we focus on a single compact bone osteon. Assume the following foundational facts and definitions: (i) the osteon radius is the distance from the central canal axis to the cement line, denoted $R$, (ii) the central canal radius is $r_{c}$, with a measured central canal diameter $D_{c}$ so that $r_{c} = D_{c}/2$, and (iii) the lamellae are concentric rings whose individual thicknesses sum to the radial difference $R - r_{c}$. In a histologic section, suppose the innermost lamella has thickness $t_{1}$ and lamellar thickness decreases linearly outward by a constant decrement $d$ per lamella, so the $i$-th lamella has thickness $t_{i} = t_{1} + (i-1)d$ with $d  0$.\n\nStarting from these definitions and the requirement that the sum of lamellar thicknesses equals the total radial difference, derive the analytic relationship connecting $R$, $r_{c}$, $t_{1}$, $d$, and the number of lamellae $N$.

Following this, we must solve for $N$ using specific numerical values and a biological constraint.\n\nFirst, we establish the foundational geometric constraint. The sum of the thicknesses of all $N$ concentric lamellae must equal the total available radial space between the central canal and the outer boundary (cement line) of the osteon. This space is given by the difference $R - r_c$.\nThe total thickness is the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} t_i$. Thus, the governing equation is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} t_i = R - r_c $$\n\nThe thickness of the $i$-th lamella, $t_i$, is given as a linear function of its position $i$:\n$$ t_i = t_1 + (i-1)d $$\nwhere $t_1$ is the thickness of the first (innermost) lamella, and $d$ is the constant decrement in thickness for each subsequent lamella. This sequence of thicknesses, $t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_N$, constitutes an arithmetic progression.\n\nThe sum of the first $N$ terms of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula $S_N = \\frac{N}{2}(a_1 + a_N)$, where $a_1$ is the first term and $a_N$ is the last term. In our case, $a_1 = t_1$ and the last term is $a_N = t_N = t_1 + (N-1)d$.\nSubstituting these into the sum formula:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} t_i = \\frac{N}{2}(t_1 + [t_1 + (N-1)d]) = \\frac{N}{2}(2t_1 + (N-1)d) $$\n\nBy combining the geometric constraint with the sum of the arithmetic series, we derive the general analytic relationship connecting the parameters:\n$$ \\frac{N}{2}(2t_1 + (N-1)d) = R - r_c $$\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of $N$.\n\nNext, we use the provided numerical values to solve for $N$.

Since the decrement $d$ is negative, the thicknesses decrease with increasing $i$. Therefore, this constraint is most restrictive for the outermost lamella, $t_N$. We must have $t_N > 0$.\n$$ t_N = t_1 + (N-1)d > 0 $$\nSubstituting the values for $t_1$ and $d$:\n$$ 8 + (N-1)(-0.5) > 0 $$\n$$ 8 > 0.5(N-1) $$\nMultiplying by $2$:\n$$ 16 > N-1 $$\n$$ 17 > N $$\nThis inequality shows that the number of lamellae, $N$, must be strictly less than $17$.\n\nComparing our two solutions, $N_1 = 18$ and $N_2 = 15$, with this constraint:\n- $N_1 = 18$ violates the condition $N  17$. If there were $18$ lamellae, the thickness of the $17$-th would be $t_{17} = 8 + (17-1)(-0.5) = 8 - 8 = 0$, and the $18$-th would be negative, which is not biologically possible.\n- $N_2 = 15$ satisfies the condition $15  17$.
