The total rate of removal is the sum of the rates of these two pathways.\nLet the rate of removal via the CYP21A2 pathway be $\\text{Rate}_{21}$ and via the CYP17A1 lyase pathway be $\\text{Rate}_{L}$.\nAccording to first-order kinetics, the rate of a reaction is the product of the rate constant and the substrate concentration.\nUnder normal conditions, the rate constants are $k_{21}$ and $k_{L}$.\nThe problem describes a genetic block where the catalytic capacity of CYP21A2 is reduced to a fraction $f$ of normal. This translates to a reduction in the effective first-order rate constant for this pathway. The new, effective rate constant becomes $f \\cdot k_{21}$.
