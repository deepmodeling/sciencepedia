The governing partial differential equation (PDE) is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 n}{\\partial x^2} + r n \\left(1 - \\frac{n}{K}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the Fisher-KPP equation, where $D$ is the diffusivity, $r$ is the intrinsic proliferation rate, and $K$ is the carrying capacity of the environment.\n\nWe seek a traveling wave solution, which represents a colonization front moving at a constant speed $v$ without changing its shape. Such a solution can be expressed as a function of a single moving coordinate, $z = x - vt$. We define $n(x,t) = N(z)$. The boundary conditions for the wave are that the density is at the carrying capacity far behind the front and zero far ahead of the front:\n$$\n\\lim_{z \\to -\\infty} N(z) = K \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lim_{z \\to \\infty} N(z) = 0\n$$\nTo transform the PDE into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $N(z)$, we compute the derivatives of $n$ with respect to $t$ and $x$ using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} = \\frac{dN}{dz} \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} = -v \\frac{dN}{dz}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x} = \\frac{dN}{dz} \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} = \\frac{dN}{dz}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 n}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{d^2N}{dz^2}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the Fisher-KPP equation yields:\n$$\n-v \\frac{dN}{dz} = D \\frac{d^2N}{dz^2} + r N \\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right)\n$$\nRearranging gives the second-order nonlinear ODE:\n$$\nD \\frac{d^2N}{dz^2} + v \\frac{dN}{dz} + r N \\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThe problem directs us to analyze the leading edge of the colonization front, which corresponds to the region where $z \\to \\infty$. In this region, the cell density is very low, so $n \\ll K$, or equivalently, $N \\ll K$. This allows us to linearize the reaction term:\n$$\nr N \\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right) \\approx r N\n$$\nThe ODE simplifies to a linear, homogeneous, second-order ODE with constant coefficients:\n$$\nD \\frac{d^2N}{dz^2} + v \\frac{dN}{dz} + r N = 0\n$$\nWe seek an exponential solution of the form $N(z) = A \\exp(\\lambda z)$, where $A$ is a constant. Substituting this ansatz into the linearized ODE gives the characteristic equation for $\\lambda$:\n$$\nD \\lambda^2 + v \\lambda + r = 0\n$$\nThe roots of this quadratic equation are:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{-v \\pm \\sqrt{v^2 - 4Dr}}{2D}\n$$\nFor a physically realistic solution, the cell density $N(z)$ must remain positive and must decay to zero as $z \\to \\infty$. The general solution in this region is a linear combination of exponential terms corresponding to the roots $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$.\nIf the discriminant $v^2 - 4Dr$ is negative, the roots $\\lambda$ are complex conjugates. The real part of $\\lambda$ is $-v/(2D)$, which is negative for $v>0$. The solution for $N(z)$ would be an exponentially decaying sinusoid:\n$$\nN(z) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{v}{2D}z\\right) \\cos(\\omega z + \\phi)\n$$\nwhere $\\omega = \\frac{\\sqrt{4Dr - v^2}}{2D}$. Such a solution oscillates and would take on negative values, which is unphysical for a cell density. Therefore, physically acceptable solutions cannot have complex roots. This imposes the constraint that the discriminant must be non-negative:\n$$\nv^2 - 4Dr \\ge 0\n$$\nThis inequality implies that $v^2 \\ge 4Dr$, or $v \\ge \\sqrt{4Dr}$.\nThus, stable, non-oscillatory traveling wave solutions can only exist for speeds $v$ greater than or equal to a minimum value. The minimal wavefront speed, $v_{min}$, is given by this lower bound:\n$$\nv = v_{min} = \\sqrt{4Dr} = 2\\sqrt{Dr}\n$$\nThis is the expression for the minimal wavefront speed as a function of $D$ and $r$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of the speed using the given parameters:\n$D = 1000\\,\\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{h}$\n$r = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n\nThe product $Dr$ is:\n$$\nDr = (1000\\,\\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{h}) \\times (0.02\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}) = 20\\,\\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{h}^{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the minimal speed $v$:\n$$\nv = 2\\sqrt{20\\,\\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{h}^{2}}\n$$\nTo simplify the radical, we factorize $20$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{20} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 5} = \\sqrt{4} \\times \\sqrt{5} = 2\\sqrt{5}\n$$\nTherefore, the speed is:\n$$\nv = 2 \\times (2\\sqrt{5}) \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{h} = 4\\sqrt{5}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{h}\n$$\nThe final answer is required as an exact expression involving radicals.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4\\sqrt{5}}$$", "id": "4918688"}, {"introduction": "Upon completing their migration, neural crest cells face a critical decision: what to become.
