Histologists can quantify this dynamic process using molecular markers like the Ki67 antigen, which is exclusively present in the nucleus of actively dividing cells. This practice introduces the concept of the Ki67 labeling index—a direct measure of the proliferative fraction in a cell population—and demonstrates how it is used to track the shift from a highly proliferative state in early pregnancy to a functionally mature, secretory state during lactation [@problem_id:4914090].", "problem": "In mammary gland histology, the Ki67 antigen is a well-established nuclear marker of actively cycling cells. The Ki67 labeling index (LI) is defined as the fraction of counted mammary epithelial nuclei that are Ki67-positive. During early pregnancy, alveolar epithelial compartments expand and exhibit increased proliferation, whereas during peak lactation the tissue is functionally oriented toward secretion, and the proliferative activity is lower. Consider standardized counts of alveolar mammary epithelial nuclei made on matched sections in early pregnancy and at peak lactation, such that sampling bias and compartmental composition are controlled by design. Suppose the measured Ki67 labeling indices for the alveolar epithelium are $0.05$ in early pregnancy and $0.01$ at peak lactation.

The proliferative fraction is quantified by the Ki67 labeling index (LI), which is the fraction of cell nuclei positive for the Ki67 antigen, a marker of active cell division.\n\nLet us define the variables based on the information provided in the problem statement.\nLet $LI_{preg}$ be the Ki67 labeling index in the alveolar epithelium during early pregnancy.\nLet $LI_{lact}$ be the Ki67 labeling index in the alveolar epithelium at peak lactation.\n\nAccording to the problem, the given values for these indices are:\n$$LI_{preg} = 0.05$$\n$$LI_{lact} = 0.01$$\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the absolute decrease in the proliferative fraction. The absolute decrease, which we can denote as $\\Delta LI$, is the difference between the initial value (in early pregnancy) and the final value (at peak lactation).\n\nThe formula for the absolute decrease is:\n$$\\Delta LI = LI_{preg} - LI_{lact}$$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values into this equation:\n$$\\Delta LI = 0.05 - 0.01$$\n\nPerforming the subtraction yields:\n$$\\Delta LI = 0.04$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the final answer must be rounded to four significant figures.
