The expression is:\n$$N_{\\text{birth}} = N_{\\text{peak}} - N_{\\text{lost}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $N_{\\text{lost}}$, we get:\n$$N_{\\text{birth}} = N_{\\text{peak}} - (f_{\\text{attrition}} \\times N_{\\text{peak}})$$\nThis can be factored to derive a more direct expression for the number of surviving cells:\n$$N_{\\text{birth}} = N_{\\text{peak}}(1 - f_{\\text{attrition}})$$\nThe problem states that at birth, all surviving germ cells are accounted for as primordial follicles. Therefore, the number of primordial follicles is equal to $N_{\\text{birth}}$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value by substituting the given data into the derived expression.\n$$f_{\\text{attrition}} = 0.70$$\nThe fraction of surviving cells is $(1 - f_{\\text{attrition}})$.\n$$1 - 0.70 = 0.30$$\nThe number of primordial follicles at birth is $30\\%$ of the peak germ cell count.\n$$N_{\\text{birth}} = (7 \\times 10^{6}) \\times (0.30)$$\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$N_{\\text{birth}} = 2.1 \\times 10^{6}$$\nThus, the expected number of primordial follicles present at birth is $2,100,000$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.1 \\times 10^{6}}$$", "id": "4920724"}, {"introduction": "A follicle's journey from a microscopic primordial state to a large, preovulatory structure is a process of dramatic transformation over many months.

We can model the diameter using a linear function:\n$$D(t) = mt + c$$\nwhere the slope $m$ represents the constant growth rate in $\\mathrm{mm/day}$. This is the quantity we need to find.\n\nThe slope of a line is defined as the change in the vertical coordinate divided by the change in the horizontal coordinate, $m = \\frac{\\Delta D}{\\Delta t}$.\nThe time interval for this phase spans from $t_1 = T_{\\mathrm{pre}}$ to $t_2 = T_{\\mathrm{pre}} + T_{\\mathrm{an}}$. The duration of this interval is:\n$$\\Delta t = t_2 - t_1 = (T_{\\mathrm{pre}} + T_{\\mathrm{an}}) - T_{\\mathrm{pre}} = T_{\\mathrm{an}}$$\nThe corresponding diameters are $D(t_1) = D(T_{\\mathrm{pre}}) = D_{\\mathrm{antral0}}$ and $D(t_2) = D(T_{\\mathrm{pre}}+T_{\\mathrm{an}}) = D_{\\mathrm{preov}}$.

We can proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two things: first, to derive the survival function $S(t)$ for a constant hazard rate $\\lambda$, and second, to calculate the survival probability for a specific case.\n\nBy definition, the hazard function $h(t)$ is the instantaneous rate of an event (in this case, atresia) at time $t$, conditional on survival up to that time. It can be expressed in terms of the probability density function of failure, $f(t)$, and the survival function, $S(t)$, as:\n$$\nh(t) = \\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}\n$$\nThe survival function $S(t)$ is the probability that the time to failure $T$ is greater than $t$, i.e., $S(t) = P(T > t)$. The cumulative distribution function of failure is $F(t) = P(T \\le t) = 1 - S(t)$. The probability density function $f(t)$ is the derivative of the cumulative distribution function, $f(t) = \\frac{dF(t)}{dt}$. Therefore, we can relate $f(t)$ to the derivative of the survival function:\n$$\nf(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(1 - S(t)) = -\\frac{dS(t)}{dt}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $f(t)$ into the definition of the hazard function gives:\n$$\nh(t) = \\frac{-\\frac{dS(t)}{dt}}{S(t)} = -\\frac{1}{S(t)}\\frac{dS(t)}{dt}\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve for $S(t)$ by separating variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dS(t)}{S(t)} = -h(t)dt\n$$\nTo find the survival function over the interval from time $0$ to time $t$, we integrate both sides. The integration on the left side is from the survival probability at time $0$, which is $S(0)$, to the survival probability at time $t$, which is $S(t)$. The integration on the right is over the time variable, which we denote by $\\tau$ to avoid confusion with the upper limit of integration $t$.\n$$\n\\int_{S(0)}^{S(t)} \\frac{1}{\\tilde{S}} d\\tilde{S} = -\\int_0^t h(\\tau) d\\tau\n$$\nBy definition, at time $t=0$, the follicle has not yet undergone atresia, so its survival probability is certain. Thus, $S(0) = 1$. The integral on the left side evaluates to:\n$$\n[\\ln(\\tilde{S})]_{S(0)}^{S(t)} = \\ln(S(t)) - \\ln(S(0)) = \\ln(S(t)) - \\ln(1) = \\ln(S(t))\n$$\nThis leads to the general relationship between the survival function and the hazard function:\n$$\n\\ln(S(t)) = -\\int_0^t h(\\tau) d\\tau\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the general form of the survival function:\n$$\nS(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^t h(\\tau) d\\tau\\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies a constant atresia hazard, $h(t) = \\lambda$.
