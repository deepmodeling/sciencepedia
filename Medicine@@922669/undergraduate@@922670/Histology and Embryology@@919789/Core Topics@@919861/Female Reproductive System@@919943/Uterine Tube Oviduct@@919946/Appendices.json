The goal is to correctly classify three apical surface organelles seen on epithelial cells and predict their predominant functional consequences in this tissue. The fundamental cell biology base is that cytoskeletal composition determines ultrastructural appearance and biophysical capabilities: microtubule-based organelles can exhibit dynein-driven motility when arranged appropriately, whereas actin-based protrusions cannot; moreover, axonemal architecture constrains motility patterns and sensory roles. Using this base, select the option that best distinguishes motile cilia from microvilli and primary cilia by TEM criteria and links each organelle type to its principal function in the oviduct.\n\nA. Motile cilia appear as numerous apical projections arising from basal bodies with nine triplet microtubules; cross-sections of their axonemes show a $9+2$ arrangement with dynein arms and radial spokes.

Primary cilia appear solitary per nonciliated cell, with a $9+0$ axoneme lacking the central pair and dynein arms.

Cytoskeletal composition dictates ultrastructure and biophysical properties.\n    2.  Microtubule-based organelles with appropriate arrangement (dynein) can be motile.\n    3.  Actin-based protrusions are not motile in a dynein-driven manner.\n    4.  Axonemal architecture influences motility and sensory capabilities.\n-   **Objective:** To select the option that correctly distinguishes these three organelles based on TEM observations and links each to its primary function in the oviduct.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly based on established principles of cell biology and histology. The descriptions of organelle ultrastructure (e.g., axonemes, actin filaments, basal bodies) and the molecular basis of motility (dynein) are standard and factually correct. The functions of these organelles within the specific context of the oviduct (transport, secretion, sensory perception) are also consistent with current scientific understanding in reproductive biology.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear task: to identify the correct set of descriptions and functional attributions from a list of possibilities. A unique and correct solution is expected to exist based on established biological facts.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, objective scientific terminology (e.g., TEM, axoneme, dynein arms, actin filaments). It is free from subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to be solved. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived by analyzing the established biological principles and evaluating each option.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe solution requires applying fundamental knowledge of cell ultrastructure and tissue-specific physiology. We will define the key characteristics of each organelle before evaluating the options.\n\n1.  **Motile Cilia:**\n    -   **Ultrastructure (TEM):** These are relatively long ($5$–$10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) projections. Each cilium is anchored to a basal body in the apical cytoplasm. The basal body has a microtubule arrangement of nine triplets with no central microtubules (a $9 \\times 3 + 0$ pattern). The motile shaft, or axoneme, has a characteristic $9+2$ arrangement of microtubules: nine outer doublets surrounding a central pair of single microtubules. Crucially, dynein arms, which are ATPase motor proteins, project from the A-tubule of each doublet toward the B-tubule of the adjacent doublet. Radial spokes connect the outer doublets to the central sheath.\n    -   **Function in Oviduct:** The dynein arms hydrolyze ATP, causing the outer doublets to slide relative to one another, resulting in a coordinated bending motion. The collective, wave-like beating of motile cilia on the oviductal epithelium generates a fluid current directed toward the uterus. This current is essential for the transport of the oocyte after ovulation and the subsequent zygote/embryo toward the uterine cavity for implantation.\n\n2.  **Microvilli:**\n    -   **Ultrastructure (TEM):** These are short ($1$–$2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$), non-motile, finger-like projections of the plasma membrane. They are characterized by a core of bundled actin filaments, which are anchored into a cytoskeletal network in the apical cytoplasm called the terminal web. They lack any microtubule structures, basal bodies, or dynein arms. In tissues with dense arrays of microvilli, they form a \"brush border\" visible under light microscopy.\n    -   **Function in Oviduct:** The primary function of microvilli is to vastly increase the surface area of the apical membrane. In the oviduct, this is particularly important for the non-ciliated secretory cells (peg cells). The increased surface area facilitates secretion of nutrients and fluids into the lumen, creating a supportive environment for gametes and the early embryo, and also aids in ion and water transport.\n\n3.  **Primary Cilia:**\n    -   **Ultrastructure (TEM):** A primary cilium is typically a solitary, non-motile projection found on most vertebrate cell types, including some epithelial cells of the oviduct. Its axoneme has a $9+0$ arrangement, meaning it possesses the nine outer microtubule doublets but lacks the central pair of microtubules. Critically, it also lacks the dynein arms, which is why it is non-motile. Like motile cilia, it arises from a basal body.\n    -   **Function in Oviduct:** Lacking the machinery for motility, primary cilia act as sensory organelles—cellular antennae. They detect mechanical stimuli (mechanosensation), such as luminal fluid flow, and chemical signals (chemosensation) from the local environment. By sensing these cues, they trigger intracellular signaling cascades that modulate cell behavior, such as proliferation, differentiation, and secretory activity, thereby regulating the overall physiology of the oviductal epithelium.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Motile cilia appear as numerous apical projections arising from basal bodies with nine triplet microtubules; cross-sections of their axonemes show a $9+2$ arrangement with dynein arms and radial spokes. Microvilli appear as short, dense apical protrusions with a core of actin filaments anchored into a terminal web and lack microtubule doublets or dynein arms. Primary cilia appear solitary per nonciliated cell, with a $9+0$ axoneme lacking the central pair and dynein arms. In the oviduct, motile cilia generate directional fluid flow to move the oocyte/zygote and luminal secretions toward the uterus, microvilli increase apical surface area to support secretion and ion/water handling, and primary cilia function as mechanochemical sensors modulating epithelial responses to luminal flow and composition.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** This option provides a completely accurate and comprehensive summary of the ultrastructure and function for all three organelles. The description of motile cilia ($9+2$ axoneme with dynein), microvilli (actin core, terminal web), and primary cilia ($9+0$ axoneme, solitary, no dynein) are all correct. The associated functions in the oviduct (transport, surface area for secretion, and sensory) are also correctly assigned.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Motile cilia are solitary apical projections with a $9+0$ axoneme and lack dynein arms; primary cilia are numerous and display a $9+2$ axoneme with dynein arms; microvilli contain microtubule doublets and radial spokes. In the oviduct, motile cilia primarily sense luminal composition, primary cilia drive bulk transport of the oocyte, and microvilli generate fluid flow.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** This option fundamentally mischaracterizes all three organelles. It swaps the structural descriptions of motile cilia and primary cilia. Motile cilia have a $9+2$ axoneme and are numerous, while primary cilia are typically solitary with a $9+0$ axoneme. It incorrectly states that microvilli contain microtubules; they contain actin filaments. The functional assignments are consequently also incorrect.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Motile cilia are identified in TEM as a fuzzy glycocalyx-rich “brush border” composed mainly of actin filaments and are specialized for nutrient absorption; microvilli exhibit a $9+2$ axoneme with dynein arms enabling beating; primary cilia occur in clusters on ciliated cells and primarily mediate secretion of serous fluid.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** This option confuses the identity of motile cilia and microvilli. The \"brush border\" composed of actin filaments is the description of microvilli, not motile cilia. Conversely, the $9+2$ axoneme with dynein arms is the structure of a motile cilium, not a microvillus. Primary cilia are typically solitary, not in clusters, and their primary function is sensory, not direct secretion.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Motile cilia are short (approximately $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) actin-based protrusions without basal bodies, whereas microvilli are longer ($5$–$10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) microtubule-based structures with dynein arms; primary cilia are absent from adult oviduct epithelium and only appear transiently during embryogenesis, so sensory roles are negligible in the adult.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** This option presents multiple factual errors. It incorrectly describes motile cilia as short and actin-based and microvilli as long and microtubule-based, which is the reverse of the truth and scrambles their composition. The statement that primary cilia are absent from the adult oviduct epithelium is false; they are present and functionally important in many adult tissues, including the oviduct.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4947332"}, {"introduction": "The oviductal epithelium is not a static structure; it undergoes profound and elegant changes orchestrated by the menstrual cycle. This exercise moves from identifying individual cell types to understanding the tissue-level dynamics governed by endocrine signals. You will use fundamental principles of hormone action to predict how epithelial cell height ($h_e(t)$) and the complexity of mucosal folds ($h_f(t)$) fluctuate in response to changing levels of estradiol and progesterone, providing a clear example of how physiology shapes histology [@problem_id:4947359].", "problem": "A 28-day menstrual cycle can be approximated by time $t \\in [0,28]$ days, with ovarian steroid hormones exhibiting characteristic phase-dependent profiles: estradiol concentration $E(t)$ rises during the late follicular phase and peaks near ovulation, while progesterone concentration $P(t)$ rises after ovulation and peaks in the mid-luteal phase. In the uterine tube (oviduct), the mucosa is composed of a simple columnar epithelium containing ciliated cells and non-ciliated secretory (peg) cells, and is thrown into mucosal folds supported by the lamina propria. Consider two histologic metrics: epithelial cell height $h_e(t)$ and mucosal fold height $h_f(t)$, and a physiological metric: oviductal fluid secretion rate $Q(t)$.\n\nStarting from the following well-tested observations that serve as first principles for this tissue: (i) steroid hormones act via intracellular receptors to modulate gene transcription, altering cell differentiation, protein synthesis, and cell volume; (ii) estradiol promotes ciliogenesis, increases ciliary activity, and causes epithelial hypertrophy in the oviduct; (iii) progesterone shifts epithelial function toward secretion by non-ciliated cells, generally reducing ciliation and epithelial height while increasing glycoprotein content and viscosity of luminal fluid; and (iv) aqueous oviductal fluid $Q(t)$ increases under estradiol dominance with relatively lower viscosity, whereas progesterone promotes more viscous secretions and a relatively lower flow, use these to predict the phase-dependent changes in $h_e(t)$ and $h_f(t)$ across the cycle and justify them mechanistically in terms of $E(t)$, $P(t)$, and $Q(t)$.\n\nWhich option best describes the expected patterns and their mechanistic justification?\n\nA. $h_e(t)$ and $h_f(t)$ are lowest in the early follicular phase, rise to maxima around ovulation when $E(t)$ is high and $P(t)$ is low, then decline in the luteal phase as $P(t)$ increases; this is explained by estradiol-driven epithelial hypertrophy and ciliogenesis that increases $h_e(t)$ and stromal hydration with higher, more aqueous $Q(t)$ that accentuates $h_f(t)$, whereas progesterone reduces ciliation and epithelial height, shifts secretion to more viscous glycoproteins with lower $Q(t)$, and diminishes fold prominence. Changes are more pronounced in the ampulla than the isthmus.\n\nB. $h_e(t)$ and $h_f(t)$ peak in the mid-luteal phase when $P(t)$ is highest, because progesterone drives epithelial hypertrophy and aqueous secretion increasing $Q(t)$; estradiol in the follicular phase reduces epithelial height and ciliation, flattening folds. The isthmus exhibits larger cyclic changes than the ampulla.\n\nC. $h_e(t)$ increases progressively from menses through the luteal phase due to cumulative stromal edema and progesterone-stimulated ciliogenesis, while $h_f(t)$ decreases near ovulation because high $Q(t)$ from estradiol mechanically distends the lumen and flattens folds; in the luteal phase, $h_f(t)$ rises as $Q(t)$ falls.\n\nD. $h_e(t)$ and $h_f(t)$ remain essentially constant throughout the cycle because oviductal histology is not hormone-responsive; only the uterus shows cyclical histologic change.

It is organized into mucosal folds supported by a lamina propria.\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   Epithelial cell height: $h_e(t)$.\n    *   Mucosal fold height: $h_f(t)$.\n    *   Oviductal fluid secretion rate: $Q(t)$.\n*   **First Principles (Provided Observations):**\n    *   (i) Steroid hormones ($E(t)$, $P(t)$) act via intracellular receptors to modulate gene transcription, affecting cell properties.\n    *   (ii) Estradiol ($E(t)$) promotes ciliogenesis, increases ciliary activity, and causes epithelial hypertrophy in the oviduct.\n    *   (iii) Progesterone ($P(t)$) shifts function to secretion, reduces ciliation and epithelial height, and increases the glycoprotein content and viscosity of luminal fluid.\n    *   (iv) Aqueous oviductal fluid secretion rate $Q(t)$ increases under estradiol ($E(t)$) dominance with low viscosity. Progesterone ($P(t)$) promotes viscous secretions and a lower flow rate.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly based on established principles of human reproductive endocrinology and histology. The descriptions of the menstrual cycle, hormonal profiles of $E(t)$ and $P(t)$, the histology of the oviduct, and the specific effects of these hormones (principles i-iv) are all factually correct and represent standard textbook knowledge in the field.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and free from internal contradictions or ambiguities. I will now proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n## Solution Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe task is to predict the phase-dependent changes in epithelial height, $h_e(t)$, and mucosal fold height, $h_f(t)$, based on the given principles.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Follicular and Ovulatory Phases (High $E(t)$, Low $P(t)$):**\n\n*   The problem states that $E(t)$ rises in the late follicular phase and peaks near ovulation. This phase is characterized by estradiol dominance.\n*   **Effect on Epithelial Height ($h_e(t)$):** According to principle (ii), estradiol \"causes epithelial hypertrophy\" and \"promotes ciliogenesis\". Hypertrophy is an increase in cell size (height and volume). Ciliogenesis increases the number and length of cilia, and ciliated cells are the tallest cell type in the oviductal epithelium. Both effects lead to a direct increase in $h_e(t)$.\n*   **Effect on Mucosal Fold Height ($h_f(t)$):** According to principle (iv), estradiol dominance leads to an increased rate of aqueous fluid secretion ($Q(t)$). This increased fluid production contributes to stromal edema (hydration) within the lamina propria, which constitutes the core of the mucosal folds. This swelling of the lamina propria causes the folds to become larger and more prominent, thus increasing $h_f(t)$.\n*   **Conclusion for Ovulatory Period:** Both $h_e(t)$ and $h_f(t)$ are expected to reach their maximum values around the time of ovulation ($t \\approx 14$ days) due to the peak in $E(t)$.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Luteal Phase (High $P(t)$, Moderate/Falling $E(t)$):**\n\n*   The problem states that $P(t)$ rises after ovulation and peaks in the mid-luteal phase. This phase is characterized by progesterone dominance.\n*   **Effect on Epithelial Height ($h_e(t)$):** According to principle (iii), progesterone \"generally reduc[es] ciliation and epithelial height\". This directly implies that $h_e(t)$ will decrease from its ovulatory peak during the luteal phase. The shift towards secretory peg cells, which are shorter and often discharge their apices, further contributes to this reduction.\n*   **Effect on Mucosal Fold Height ($h_f(t)$):** According to principle (iv), progesterone \"promotes more viscous secretions and a relatively lower flow\". The reduction in aqueous fluid production leads to a decrease in stromal edema within the lamina propria. Consequently, the mucosal folds become less swollen, less turgid, and decrease in height. Thus, $h_f(t)$ declines during the luteal phase.\n*   **Conclusion for Luteal Period:** Both $h_e(t)$ and $h_f(t)$ are expected to decrease during the luteal phase under the influence of progesterone.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Early Follicular Phase (Low $E(t)$, Low $P(t)$):**\n\n*   Following the corpus luteum's demise at the end of the previous cycle, both $E(t)$ and $P(t)$ are at their lowest levels. In this hormonally quiescent state, the oviductal mucosa is at its most atrophic.\n*   **Conclusion for Early Follicular Period:** Both $h_e(t)$ and $h_f(t)$ are at their minimum values during this time, before the rise in $E(t)$ initiates the next phase of growth.\n\n**Summary of Prediction:** The metrics $h_e(t)$ and $h_f(t)$ are minimal in the early follicular phase, rise to a maximum around ovulation driven by estradiol, and then decline during the luteal phase under the influence of progesterone.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $h_e(t)$ and $h_f(t)$ are lowest in the early follicular phase, rise to maxima around ovulation when $E(t)$ is high and $P(t)$ is low, then decline in the luteal phase as $P(t)$ increases; this is explained by estradiol-driven epithelial hypertrophy and ciliogenesis that increases $h_e(t)$ and stromal hydration with higher, more aqueous $Q(t)$ that accentuates $h_f(t)$, whereas progesterone reduces ciliation and epithelial height, shifts secretion to more viscous glycoproteins with lower $Q(t)$, and diminishes fold prominence. Changes are more pronounced in the ampulla than the isthmus.**\n\n*   This option accurately describes the pattern of $h_e(t)$ and $h_f(t)$ peaking at ovulation and declining in the luteal phase, as derived above.\n*   The mechanistic justification provided for the estradiol effects (epithelial hypertrophy, ciliogenesis, stromal hydration) and progesterone effects (reduced epithelial height, viscous secretions, diminished folds) perfectly aligns with the given principles (ii), (iii), and (iv).\n*   The additional statement that changes are more pronounced in the ampulla is factually correct in reproductive histology; the ampulla, being the site of fertilization, possesses the most elaborate mucosal folding and highest degree of ciliation, and thus exhibits the most dramatic cyclic changes.\n*   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $h_e(t)$ and $h_f(t)$ peak in the mid-luteal phase when $P(t)$ is highest, because progesterone drives epithelial hypertrophy and aqueous secretion increasing $Q(t)$; estradiol in the follicular phase reduces epithelial height and ciliation, flattening folds. The isthmus exhibits larger cyclic changes than the ampulla.**\n\n*   This option claims a peak during the mid-luteal phase. This directly contradicts principle (iii), which states progesterone *reduces* epithelial height.\n*   It incorrectly attributes epithelial hypertrophy and increased aqueous secretion to progesterone, which is the opposite of the effects described in principles (iii) and (iv).\n*   It incorrectly attributes a reduction in epithelial height and ciliation to estradiol, which is the opposite of the effect described in principle (ii).\n*   The claim that the isthmus shows larger changes than the ampulla is factually incorrect.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $h_e(t)$ increases progressively from menses through the luteal phase due to cumulative stromal edema and progesterone-stimulated ciliogenesis, while $h_f(t)$ decreases near ovulation because high $Q(t)$ from estradiol mechanically distends the lumen and flattens folds; in the luteal phase, $h_f(t)$ rises as $Q(t)$ falls.**\n\n*   This option claims $h_e(t)$ increases through the luteal phase. This contradicts principle (iii) (progesterone reduces epithelial height).\n*   It falsely claims progesterone stimulates ciliogenesis; principle (ii) attributes this to estradiol, and principle (iii) states progesterone reduces ciliation.\n*   The explanation for $h_f(t)$ decreasing near ovulation is mechanistically flawed. Estradiol-induced stromal edema *increases* fold height; it does not cause folds to flatten. While luminal distension is a physical possibility, the primary histological effect on the folds themselves is swelling.\n*   The claim that $h_f(t)$ rises in the luteal phase contradicts our derivation and the known effect of progesterone causing a less edematous stroma.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $h_e(t)$ and $h_f(t)$ remain essentially constant throughout the cycle because oviductal histology is not hormone-responsive; only the uterus shows cyclical histologic change. Accordingly, $Q(t)$ is constant and independent of $E(t)$ and $P(t)$.**\n\n*   This option's central premise—that the oviduct is not hormone-responsive—is directly and comprehensively contradicted by every single principle (i, ii, iii, and iv) provided in the problem statement.\n*   The claim that only the uterus shows cyclical change is factually incorrect.\n*   The conclusion that $Q(t)$ is constant is directly contradicted by principle (iv).\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4947359"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the normal structure and function of the oviduct allows us to predict the consequences when things go wrong.

The baseline ciliary velocity, $v_{\\text{cilia},0}$, is calculated using the given parameters:\n- Shear proportionality constant $\\gamma = 0.30 \\,\\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}$\n- Mucus layer thickness $h = 2.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\text{m}$\n- Dynamic viscosity $\\eta = 1.20 \\,\\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}$\n- Baseline frequency $f_{0} = 12 \\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n\n$$\nv_{\\text{cilia},0} = \\frac{\\gamma h}{\\eta} f_{0} = \\frac{(0.30 \\,\\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s})(2.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\text{m})}{1.20 \\,\\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}} (12 \\,\\text{s}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\nv_{\\text{cilia},0} = \\frac{0.60 \\times 10^{-5}}{1.20} \\times 12 \\,\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1} = (0.5 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 12 \\,\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nTo express this in the requested units of $\\mu\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}$, we use the conversion $1 \\,\\text{m} = 10^{6} \\,\\mu\\text{m}$:\n$$\nv_{\\text{cilia},0} = (6.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (10^{6} \\,\\mu\\text{m} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-1}) = 60 \\,\\mu\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe baseline total transport velocity, $v_{\\text{total},0}$, is the sum of this ciliary component and the constant peristaltic component, $v_{p} = 25 \\,\\mu\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}$:\n$$\nv_{\\text{total},0} = v_{\\text{cilia},0} + v_{p} = 60 \\,\\mu\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1} + 25 \\,\\mu\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1} = 85 \\,\\mu\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\nNext, we consider the new conditions corresponding to Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD), denoted with a subscript `new`. The ciliary beat frequency drops by $60\\%$ relative to $f_{0}$. The new frequency, $f_{\\text{new}}$, is:\n$$\nf_{\\text{new}} = f_{0} \\times (1 - 0.60) = 0.40 f_{0} = 0.40 \\times (12 \\,\\text{Hz}) = 4.8 \\,\\text{Hz}\n$$\nThe new ciliary velocity, $v_{\\text{cilia,new}}$, is linearly proportional to the frequency, so it will also be $40\\%$ of the baseline ciliary velocity:\n$$\nv_{\\text{cilia,new}} = 0.40 \\times v_{\\text{cilia},0} = 0.40 \\times (60 \\,\\mu\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}) = 24 \\,\\mu\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe new total particle clearance velocity, $v_{\\text{total,new}}$, is the sum of this new ciliary component and the unchanged peristaltic component:\n$$\nv_{\\text{total,new}} = v_{\\text{cilia,new}} + v_{p} = 24 \\,\\mu\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1} + 25 \\,\\mu\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1} = 49 \\,\\mu\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the first answer is $49.0 \\,\\mu\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n\nFor the second part, we must compute the dimensionless ectopic pregnancy risk index, defined as the ratio of the new oviductal transit time, $T_{\\text{new}}$, to the baseline transit time, $T_{0}$. The problem states that transit time is inversely proportional to the total transport velocity. Let $L$ be the length of the transport path. Then $T = L/v_{\\text{total}}$. The risk index is therefore:\n$$\n\\text{Risk Index} = \\frac{T_{\\text{new}}}{T_{0}} = \\frac{L / v_{\\text{total,new}}}{L / v_{\\text{total},0}} = \\frac{v_{\\text{total},0}}{v_{\\text{total,new}}}\n$$\nUsing the previously calculated total velocities:\n$$\n\\text{Risk Index} = \\frac{85 \\,\\mu\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}}{49 \\,\\mu\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{85}{49} \\approx 1.7346938...\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the risk index is $1.73$.\n\nThe two results are the new total velocity ($49.0 \\,\\mu\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}$) and the risk index ($1.73$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 49.0 & 1.73 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4947368"}]}
