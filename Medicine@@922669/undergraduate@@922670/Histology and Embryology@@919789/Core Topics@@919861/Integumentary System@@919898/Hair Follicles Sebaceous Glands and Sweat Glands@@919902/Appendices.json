Androgens such as dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are generated locally from testosterone by the enzyme 5$\\alpha$-reductase, which is expressed in sebaceous glands. Two additional well-tested facts are: receptor-mediated transcriptional responses scale with the fraction of occupied receptors, and the fraction of occupied receptors for a single ligand in equilibrium with its receptor can be approximated by a Langmuir isotherm, namely the receptor occupancy $f = \\dfrac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}$, where $[L]$ is the free ligand concentration and $K_d$ is the dissociation constant. Free serum testosterone available to tissues is reduced by binding to Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG), so a simple approximation is $[T_{\\mathrm{free}}] = [T_{\\mathrm{total}}]\\cdot(1 - b)$, where $b$ is the fraction of testosterone bound to SHBG. Local DHT concentration in sebaceous glands scales with available free testosterone and 5$\\alpha$-reductase activity, so $[DHT] = c\\cdot[T_{\\mathrm{free}}]$, where $c$ represents local 5$\\alpha$-reductase activity. To tie receptor occupancy to sebaceous output, assume predicted sebum production $S$ is proportional to $R\\cdot f$, where $R$ is androgen receptor density in sebocytes and $f$ is receptor occupancy.

Let $V$ represent the volume of the primary fluid produced by the secretory coil. The problem states that water flux in the duct is negligible, so the final volume of sweat is also $V$.\n\nThe total moles of chloride entering the duct are given by:\n$$n_{\\text{primary}} = C_{\\text{primary}} V$$\n\nThe total moles of chloride in the final sweat exiting the duct are:\n$$n_{\\text{final}} = C_{\\text{final}} V$$\n\nThe moles of chloride reabsorbed by the duct are the difference between the initial and final amounts:\n$$n_{\\text{reabsorbed}} = n_{\\text{primary}} - n_{\\text{final}} = (C_{\\text{primary}} - C_{\\text{final}})V$$\n\nThe problem defines the fractional reabsorption, $f$, as the fraction of chloride removed from the primary fluid. This can be expressed as the ratio of moles reabsorbed to the initial moles:\n$$f = \\frac{n_{\\text{reabsorbed}}}{n_{\\text{primary}}} = \\frac{(C_{\\text{primary}} - C_{\\text{final}})V}{C_{\\text{primary}}V}$$\nThe volume term $V$ cancels, yielding a relationship between concentrations and the fractional reabsorption:\n$$f = \\frac{C_{\\text{primary}} - C_{\\text{final}}}{C_{\\text{primary}}} = 1 - \\frac{C_{\\text{final}}}{C_{\\text{primary}}}$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to express the final concentration in terms of the primary concentration and the fractional reabsorption:\n$$C_{\\text{final}} = C_{\\text{primary}} (1 - f)$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the fractional reabsorption in a healthy individual, $f_{\\text{normal}}$, using the provided data: $C_{\\text{primary}} = 100$ mM and $C_{\\text{normal}} = 30$ mM.\n$$f_{\\text{normal}} = 1 - \\frac{C_{\\text{normal}}}{C_{\\text{primary}}} = 1 - \\frac{30 \\, \\text{mM}}{100 \\, \\text{mM}} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$$\nThus, in a normal sweat gland, $70\\,\\%$ of the chloride is reabsorbed.\n\nNext, we consider the case of cystic fibrosis.
