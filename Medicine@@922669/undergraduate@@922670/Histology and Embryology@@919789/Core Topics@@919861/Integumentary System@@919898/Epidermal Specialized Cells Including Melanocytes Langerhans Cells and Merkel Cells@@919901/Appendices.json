A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the melanocyte planar density, $D_{m}$, based on the keratinocyte planar density, $D_{k}$, and the number of keratinocytes per melanin unit, $N_{k}$.\n\nLet us consider an arbitrary, fixed area of the basal layer, denoted by $A$. The planar density of a cell type is defined as the total number of cells of that type divided by the area they occupy.\nThe total number of basal keratinocytes over this area, $N_{k, \\text{total}}$, is given by:\n$$N_{k, \\text{total}} = D_{k} \\cdot A$$\nSimilarly, the total number of melanocytes over the same area, $N_{m, \\text{total}}$, is:\n$$N_{m, \\text{total}} = D_{m} \\cdot A$$\n\nThe problem states that one melanocyte functionally interacts with $N_{k}$ keratinocytes, forming a \"melanin unit\". It also specifies that the domains of these melanocytes \"collectively cover the basal keratinocyte population without overlap.\" This is the application of the conservation-of-count principle. It implies that the entire population of basal keratinocytes is partitioned among the domains of the melanocytes. Therefore, the total number of keratinocytes must be equal to the total number of melanocytes multiplied by the number of keratinocytes associated with each melanocyte. This gives the following relationship:\n$$N_{k, \\text{total}} = N_{k} \\cdot N_{m, \\text{total}}$$\n\nWe can now substitute the expressions for the total cell counts in terms of their respective densities and the area $A$:\n$$(D_{k} \\cdot A) = N_{k} \\cdot (D_{m} \\cdot A)$$\n\nSince the area $A$ is a non-zero arbitrary area common to both sides of the equation, it can be cancelled out:\n$$D_{k} = N_{k} \\cdot D_{m}$$\n\nThis equation represents the relationship between the densities. To find the expression for the melanocyte planar density, $D_{m}$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$D_{m} = \\frac{D_{k}}{N_{k}}$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for $D_{m}$ in terms of $D_{k}$ and $N_{k}$.\n\nNext, we evaluate $D_{m}$ using the given numerical values: $D_{k} = 8{,}000$ cells/mm$^{2}$ and $N_{k} = 36$.\n$$D_{m} = \\frac{8000}{36} \\text{ cells/mm}^{2}$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$D_{m} \\approx 222.222... \\text{ cells/mm}^{2}$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$D_{m} \\approx 222.2 \\text{ cells/mm}^{2}$$\n\nFinally, the problem asks for an explanation of a geometric tiling constraint that the basal layer must satisfy. The statement that \"melanocyte domains collectively cover the basal keratinocyte population without overlap\" is a formal description of a tessellation or tiling of a two-dimensional plane. The \"domains\" are the tiles. For such a structure to be spatially realizable without gaps or overlaps, the average shape of a melanocyte's territorial domain (which contains the $N_{k}$ associated keratinocytes) must be a polygon that can tile a 2D plane. While individual cell shapes can be irregular, the average topological structure must conform to this constraint. A prominent example of an efficient and stable tiling shape found in biological tissues, such as epithelia, is the hexagon. Therefore, a key geometric constraint is that the average shape of a melanocyte's domain must be able to tessellate the 2D epithelial sheet.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{222.2}$$", "id": "4886343"}, {"introduction": "Beyond their spatial organization, melanocytes perform a critical protective function.

To solve it, we separate the variables $I$ and $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{I} = -\\mu \\, dx\n$$\nNext, we integrate both sides. The intensity decreases from its initial value, $I_0$, at the surface ($x=0$) to a value $I(x)$ at a depth $x$. Therefore, we integrate the left side from $I_0$ to $I$ and the right side from $0$ to $x$:\n$$\n\\int_{I_0}^{I} \\frac{dI'}{I'} = \\int_0^x (-\\mu) \\, dx'\n$$\nSince $\\mu$ is given as a positive constant (uniform absorption), it can be taken outside the integral on the right-hand side:\n$$\n\\int_{I_0}^{I} \\frac{dI'}{I'} = -\\mu \\int_0^x dx'\n$$\nThe evaluation of these definite integrals yields:\n$$\n[\\ln(I')]_{I_0}^{I} = -\\mu [x']_0^x\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(I) - \\ln(I_0) = -\\mu (x - 0)\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, we combine the terms on the left side:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{I}{I_0}\\right) = -\\mu x\n$$\nTo solve for the transmitted intensity fraction, $\\frac{I}{I_0}$, we exponentiate both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{I}{I_0} = \\exp(-\\mu x)\n$$\nThis is the well-known Beer-Lambert law, which has been rigorously derived from the provided differential equation.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nThe problem requires the numerical calculation of this fraction using the given values.\nThe absorption coefficient is $\\mu = 5\\ \\mathrm{mm^{-1}}$.\nThe thickness of the melanin cap is $x = 5\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$.\nAs instructed, for consistency, we must express the thickness $x$ in units of millimeters.

The first five significant figures are $9, 7, 5, 3, 0$.

This means that about $97.53\\%$ of the incident UVB radiation passes through the melanin cap and reaches the region of the nucleus. The attenuation, which is $1 - I/I_0$, is approximately $1 - 0.97531 = 0.02469$, or about $2.47\\%$.
