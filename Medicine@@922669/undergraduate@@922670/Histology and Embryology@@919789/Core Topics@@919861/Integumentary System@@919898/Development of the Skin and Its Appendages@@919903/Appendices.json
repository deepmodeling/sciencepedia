Consider Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP), which diffuses within the two-dimensional plane of the embryonic epidermis and is removed by first-order degradation. Assume a single nascent placode is a localized, steady source of BMP, and that at distances sufficiently far from the source the steady-state concentration field reflects a balance between diffusion and first-order loss. Start from the fundamental diffusion law and first-order decay kinetics to obtain the characteristic length scale that governs how far the inhibitory signal remains appreciable.

Express $\\rho$ in terms of $D$ and $\\lambda$.\n    4. Calculate the numerical value of $\\rho$ in units of placodes per $\\mathrm{mm^2}$, rounded to three significant figures.\n\n#### Step 1.2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of reaction-diffusion systems, a standard and well-validated framework for explaining morphogenetic patterning in developmental biology. The parameters and assumptions (steady-state, first-order decay, hexagonal packing) are clearly stated and consistent. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and unambiguous. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n#### Step 1.3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution is constructed in four parts as requested.\n\n#### Part 1: Derivation of the Characteristic Length Scale, $R$\nThe physical process is described by the steady-state reaction-diffusion equation. For a substance with concentration $C$ that diffuses with coefficient $D$ and is degraded with a first-order rate constant $\\lambda$, the governing equation is:\n$$ D \\nabla^2 C - \\lambda C + S = 0 $$\nwhere $S$ is the source term. The problem states to consider the concentration field \"at distances sufficiently far from the source,\" where we can assume $S=0$. The equation becomes:\n$$ D \\nabla^2 C - \\lambda C = 0 $$\nThis equation can be nondimensionalized. A characteristic length scale, $L$, emerges from balancing the two terms. By dimensional analysis, the units of the diffusion term are $[D][C]/[length]^2$ and the units of the degradation term are $[\\lambda][C]$. Equating the scales of these terms gives:\n$$ \\frac{D C}{L^2} \\sim \\lambda C $$\n$$ L^2 \\sim \\frac{D}{\\lambda} $$\nThus, the characteristic length scale is $L = \\sqrt{D/\\lambda}$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the inhibitory radius, $R$, is this characteristic length, defining it as the distance over which the signal decays by a factor of $\\exp(-1)$. Assuming radial symmetry from the point source, the governing equation in polar coordinates is $D(\\frac{d^2C}{dr^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{dC}{dr}) - \\lambda C = 0$. The decaying solution for $r>0$ is proportional to the modified Bessel function of the second kind, $C(r) \\propto K_0(r/L)$. For large arguments, $K_0(x) \\approx \\sqrt{\\pi/(2x)} \\exp(-x)$. The dominant spatial decay is captured by the exponential term, $\\exp(-r/L)$. The distance over which this term decays by $\\exp(-1)$ is precisely $L$. Therefore, the inhibitory radius $R$ is equal to this characteristic length.\n$$ R = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\lambda}} $$\n\n#### Part 2: Areal Density as a Function of $R$\nThe placodes are arranged on an ideal hexagonal lattice. The packing is as dense as possible, subject to the constraint that the minimum center-to-center distance is $2R$. This means the nearest-neighbor distance on the lattice, which is the lattice constant $a$, is exactly $2R$.\n$$ a = 2R $$\nThe areal density, $\\rho$, is the number of lattice points per unit area. For a hexagonal lattice, the area of the primitive unit cell, which contains one lattice point, is given by:\n$$ A_{\\text{cell}} = a^2 \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} $$\nThe density is the reciprocal of the area of the primitive unit cell:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{1}{A_{\\text{cell}}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} a^2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3} a^2} $$\nSubstituting $a = 2R$ into this expression gives the density as a function of the inhibitory radius $R$:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}(2R)^2} = \\frac{2}{4\\sqrt{3}R^2} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}R^2} $$\n\n#### Part 3: Areal Density in Terms of $D$ and $\\lambda$\nWe now express the areal density $\\rho$ in terms of the biophysical parameters $D$ and $\\lambda$. We use the relationship $R = \\sqrt{D/\\lambda}$, which implies $R^2 = D/\\lambda$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\rho$:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}R^2} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}\\left(\\frac{D}{\\lambda}\\right)} $$\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\sqrt{3}D} $$\n\n#### Part 4: Numerical Evaluation\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value of the areal density using the provided parameters:\n$D = 3.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{mm^{2} \\ s^{-1}}$\n$\\lambda = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $\\rho$:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}}{2\\sqrt{3} \\left(3.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{mm^{2} \\ s^{-1}}\\right)} $$\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}}{6.0\\sqrt{3} \\times 10^{-5}} \\ \\mathrm{mm^{-2}} $$\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{10}{6\\sqrt{3}} \\ \\mathrm{mm^{-2}} = \\frac{5}{3\\sqrt{3}} \\ \\mathrm{mm^{-2}} $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\rho \\approx \\frac{5}{3 \\times 1.73205} \\ \\mathrm{mm^{-2}} \\approx \\frac{5}{5.19615} \\ \\mathrm{mm^{-2}} \\approx 0.9622504... \\ \\mathrm{mm^{-2}} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\rho \\approx 0.962 \\ \\mathrm{mm^{-2}} $$\nThe final answer is the numerical value representing the number of placodes per square millimeter.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.962}$$", "id": "4881223"}, {"introduction": "Once a tissue is patterned, its structural integrity is paramount.

Final State (After Reduction)**\n\nIntegrin expression drops to a fraction $r$ of the baseline, where $0 < r \\leq 1$. This reduction independently renders a fraction $1-r$ of the initially functional sites nonfunctional. This implies that each individual site that was functional before the reduction remains functional with a probability $r$, independently of all other sites. This is a process known as random thinning of a Poisson process.\n\nWe can formally derive the distribution of the number of sites in the final state, $N_{f}$. Let the initial number of sites be $k$. The probability of this is $P(N_{0}=k)$. Given that there are $k$ sites, the number of sites that remain functional, $N_{f}$, follows a binomial distribution with parameters $k$ and $r$:\n$$P(N_{f}=j | N_{0}=k) = \\binom{k}{j} r^j (1-r)^{k-j}$$\nTo find the unconditional probability $P(N_{f}=j)$, we sum over all possible initial numbers of sites $k$ (from $j$ to $\\infty$) using the law of total probability:\n$$P(N_{f}=j) = \\sum_{k=j}^{\\infty} P(N_{f}=j | N_{0}=k) P(N_{0}=k)$$\n$$P(N_{f}=j) = \\sum_{k=j}^{\\infty} \\left( \\binom{k}{j} r^j (1-r)^{k-j} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!} \\right)$$\nSubstituting the expression for the binomial coefficient, $\\binom{k}{j} = \\frac{k!}{j!(k-j)!}$:\n$$P(N_{f}=j) = \\sum_{k=j}^{\\infty} \\frac{k!}{j!(k-j)!} r^j (1-r)^{k-j} \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}$$\n$$P(N_{f}=j) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} r^j}{j!} \\sum_{k=j}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(k-j)!} (1-r)^{k-j} \\lambda^k$$\nLet $m = k-j$, which implies $k = m+j$.

An increased per-area detachment probability, $\\Delta P_{\\text{detach}} > 0$, signifies that at a microscopic level, a larger fraction of the interface is unattached. This weakens the overall mechanical integrity of the dermal-epidermal junction.
