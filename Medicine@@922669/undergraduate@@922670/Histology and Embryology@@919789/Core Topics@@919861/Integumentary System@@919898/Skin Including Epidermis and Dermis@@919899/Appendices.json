Consider a simplified two-state model of cadherin extracellular domains: an apo state that cannot form trans-dimers, and a calcium-bound state that is competent for trans binding. Calcium binding to the cadherin ectodomain is cooperative and can be parameterized by a Hill-type relation with a dissociation constant and Hill coefficient.

It is grounded in established principles of cell cycle kinetics and tissue homeostasis. All necessary data are provided, and the values are biologically plausible. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities: the basal keratinocyte cell cycle time, $T_c$, and the replacement rate of the viable interfollicular epidermis, $R$.\n\nFirst, we determine the cell cycle time, $T_c$. For an asynchronously cycling cell population in a homeostatic steady state, not all cells may be actively proliferating. The fraction of cells that belong to the proliferative pool is defined as the growth fraction, $GF$. Within this proliferative pool, the fraction of cells in a specific phase of the cycle (e.g., S-phase or M-phase) is given by the ratio of the duration of that phase, $T_{\\text{phase}}$, to the total cell cycle time, $T_c$. The fraction of the *total* population (both cycling and non-cycling cells) observed in a given phase is therefore the product of the growth fraction and this time ratio.\nThe general relationship is:\n$$F_{\\text{phase}} = GF \\times \\frac{T_{\\text{phase}}}{T_c}$$\nwhere $F_{\\text{phase}}$ is the fraction of the total cell population in a specific phase.\n\nThe problem provides data for two distinct phases: the S-phase and the M-phase. We can use either set of data to calculate $T_c$.\n\nUsing the S-phase data:\nThe Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling index, $LI$, represents the fraction of the total basal cell population in S-phase. Thus, $F_{\\text{phase}} = LI$. The duration of the S-phase is given as $T_S$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$$LI = GF \\times \\frac{T_S}{T_c}$$\nWe are given $LI = 0.20$, $GF = 0.50$, and $T_S = 10$ hours. We can solve for $T_c$:\n$$T_c = GF \\times \\frac{T_S}{LI}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$T_c = 0.50 \\times \\frac{10 \\text{ h}}{0.20} = 0.50 \\times 50 \\text{ h} = 25 \\text{ h}$$\n\nTo verify the consistency of the provided data, we can perform the same calculation using the M-phase data.\nThe mitotic fraction, $MF$, is the fraction of the total basal cell population in M-phase. The duration of mitosis is given as $T_M$.\nThe equation is:\n$$MF = GF \\times \\frac{T_M}{T_c}$$\nWe are given $MF = 0.016$, $GF = 0.50$, and $T_M = 0.80$ hours. Solving for $T_c$:\n$$T_c = GF \\times \\frac{T_M}{MF}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$T_c = 0.50 \\times \\frac{0.80 \\text{ h}}{0.016} = 0.50 \\times 50 \\text{ h} = 25 \\text{ h}$$\nThe results from both S-phase and M-phase data are identical, which confirms the internal consistency of the problem statement. The cell cycle time for proliferative basal keratinocytes is $T_c = 25$ hours. Rounding to three significant figures gives $T_c = 25.0$ hours.\n\nNext, we calculate the replacement rate, $R$, of the viable interfollicular epidermis, defined as the decimal fraction of this compartment replaced per day.\nThe viable epidermis is stated to comprise $5$ layers of cells with roughly equal in-plane density. Let $N_B$ be the number of cells in the basal layer. The total number of cells in the viable epidermis is $N_{\\text{total}} = 5 \\times N_B$.\n\nCell production occurs exclusively in the basal layer from the proliferative pool of cells. The number of proliferative cells in the basal layer is $N_P = GF \\times N_B$.\nThese $N_P$ cells divide with a cell cycle time of $T_c$. The rate of cell divisions in the basal layer is the number of proliferative cells divided by the cell cycle time:\n$$\\text{Rate of divisions} = \\frac{N_P}{T_c} = \\frac{GF \\times N_B}{T_c}$$\nThe problem states that in this homeostatic tissue, each division yields one daughter cell that remains in the basal layer to divide again (on average) and one daughter cell that leaves the basal layer to differentiate. Therefore, the rate at which new cells are supplied to the suprabasal layers is equal to the rate of divisions.\n$$\\text{Rate of cell supply to suprabasal layers} = \\frac{GF \\times N_B}{T_c}$$\nThis is the rate of renewal for the entire viable epidermis. The replacement rate, $R$, is this renewal rate divided by the total number of cells in the viable epidermis, $N_{\\text{total}}$.\n$$R = \\frac{\\text{Rate of cell supply}}{N_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{GF \\times N_B}{T_c} \\right)}{5 \\times N_B}$$\nThe term $N_B$ cancels, yielding an expression for the rate that is independent of the tissue size:\n$$R = \\frac{GF}{5 \\times T_c}$$\nUsing the values $GF = 0.50$ and $T_c = 25$ hours, we find the rate in units of inverse hours:\n$$R = \\frac{0.50}{5 \\times 25 \\text{ h}} = \\frac{0.50}{125 \\text{ h}} = 0.0040 \\text{ h}^{-1}$$\nThe problem asks for the replacement rate $R$ in units of per day. We convert the units by multiplying by the number of hours in a day ($24$ h/day):\n$$R = 0.0040 \\text{ h}^{-1} \\times 24 \\frac{\\text{h}}{\\text{day}} = 0.096 \\text{ day}^{-1}$$\nRounding this result to three significant figures gives $R = 0.0960$ per day.\n\nThe calculated values are $T_c = 25.0$ hours and $R = 0.0960$ day$^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 25.0 & 0.0960 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4929016"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice expands the view to the tissue level, examining the crucial physiological relationship between the avascular epidermis and the underlying, blood-rich dermis.

Assume the dermis in the interval $x\\in[-d,0]$ has negligible oxygen consumption, while the viable epidermis in $x\\in[0,L]$ consumes oxygen at a uniform volumetric rate $q$ due to keratinocyte metabolism.
