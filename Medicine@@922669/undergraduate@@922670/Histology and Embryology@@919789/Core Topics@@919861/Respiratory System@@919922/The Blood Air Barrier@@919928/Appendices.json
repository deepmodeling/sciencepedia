We can therefore approximate the derivative with a finite difference. Let the concentration on the alveolar side be $c_1$ and on the capillary side be $c_2$. The flux is in the direction of decreasing concentration. We are given the magnitude of the concentration difference as $\\Delta c$, which we define as $\\Delta c = c_1 - c_2 > 0$. The gradient is then:\n$$ \\frac{dc}{dx} \\approx \\frac{c_2 - c_1}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{-(c_1 - c_2)}{\\Delta x} = -\\frac{\\Delta c}{\\Delta x} $$\nSubstituting this into Fick's law, we obtain the magnitude of the molar flux density:\n$$ j = -D \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta c}{\\Delta x}\\right) = D \\frac{\\Delta c}{\\Delta x} $$\nThe problem asks for the total molar flux $J$ across the entire surface area $A$.

The typical resting $V_{O_2}$ is approximately $250\\,\\text{mL}/\\text{min}$.

This large discrepancy arises from several idealizations in the model, primarily:\n1.  **The Concentration Gradient ($\\Delta c$)**: The value $\\Delta c = 0.2\\,\\text{mol}/\\text{m}^{3}$ corresponds to a very large partial pressure difference, greater than what is physiologically observed. More importantly, the model assumes this maximum concentration difference is maintained across the entire alveolar surface area $A$.\n2.  **Perfusion Limitation**: In reality, oxygen transfer at rest is not *diffusion-limited* but *perfusion-limited*. This means the rate-limiting step is the speed at which blood flows through the capillaries and carries oxygen away. As blood traverses a capillary, it rapidly equilibrates with alveolar air, meaning the concentration gradient for oxygen diminishes to nearly zero well before the blood exits the capillary. The model's assumption of a constant, large $\\Delta c$ across the entire exchange surface is therefore a major oversimplification. The calculation effectively determines the lung's maximum diffusing capacity ($D_{L_{O_2}}$) under a hypothetical, fixed gradient, rather than the actual oxygen uptake rate, which is governed by a much smaller *average* gradient and the rate of blood flow.\n3.  **Parameter Uniformity**: The assumptions of a uniform thickness $\\Delta x$ and surface area $A$ are also simplifications. The actual blood-air barrier has a variable thickness, and not all of the anatomical surface area may be actively participating in gas exchange at rest.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parameters for area and thickness are reasonable estimates for the anatomical structures, the assumption regarding the driving concentration difference oversimplifies the dynamic process of gas exchange, leading to a calculated flux that represents a theoretical maximum capacity rather than the actual physiological rate at rest.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{3.33 \\times 10^{-2}} $$", "id": "4935120"}, {"introduction": "The blood-air barrier is not a single uniform slab but a composite of distinct histological layers.

For a composite barrier made of layers in series, the total resistance ($R_{\\text{total}}$) is the sum of the individual resistances. Conductance is the reciprocal of resistance, so:\n$$ \\frac{1}{D_M} = R_{\\text{total}} = R_e + R_b + R_c $$\nwhere $R_e, R_b, R_c$ are the resistances of the epithelium, basement membrane, and endothelium, respectively.\n\nThe resistance of a single layer of thickness $t$, area $A$, and diffusion coefficient $D$ is given by $R = \\frac{t}{AD}$. Since $A$ and $D$ are constant across all layers, the total resistance is proportional to the total thickness $T = t_e + t_b + t_c$:\n$$ R_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{t_e}{AD} + \\frac{t_b}{AD} + \\frac{t_c}{AD} = \\frac{t_e + t_b + t_c}{AD} = \\frac{T}{AD} $$\nFrom this, we see that the membrane diffusing capacity $D_M = \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{AD}{T}$.
