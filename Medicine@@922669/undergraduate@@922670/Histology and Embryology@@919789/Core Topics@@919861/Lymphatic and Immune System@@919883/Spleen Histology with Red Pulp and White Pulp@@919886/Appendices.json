A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested: histological identification, derivation of the stereological estimator, and calculation of the areal fractions.\n\n**1. Histological Identification**\n\n- The compartment described as a \"dense lymphoid aggregate\" surrounding a \"small artery with an eccentric periarterial sheath\" is, by definition, the **white pulp** of the spleen. The periarteriolar lymphoid sheath (PALS) is a primary component of the white pulp, consisting mainly of T-lymphocytes aggregated around a central arteriole.\n- The compartment described as a \"reticular meshwork of cords and wide channels\" is, by definition, the **red pulp** of the spleen. The cords are the splenic cords (cords of Billroth), which contain macrophages, plasma cells, and erythrocytes. The wide channels are the splenic venous sinusoids, which are involved in filtering the blood.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Unbiased Estimator for Areal and Volume Fraction**\n\nThe goal is to show that the point fraction ($P_P$) is an unbiased estimator for the areal fraction ($A_A$), and by extension, the volume fraction ($V_V$).\n\nLet the total area of the microscopic field of view be $A_{total}$. Let the area occupied by the profiles of a specific compartment (e.g., white pulp) be $A_{comp}$. The true areal fraction $A_A$ of this compartment is:\n$$A_A = \\frac{A_{comp}}{A_{total}}$$\nA grid of $P_T$ test points is superimposed uniformly at random over this area. The probability that any single random point hits the compartment is equal to the ratio of the areas, which is the areal fraction $A_A$.\nLet $X_i$ be a Bernoulli random variable for the $i$-th point, where $i = 1, 2, \\dots, P_T$.\n- $X_i = 1$ if point $i$ hits the compartment.\n- $X_i = 0$ if point $i$ does not hit the compartment.\n\nThe probability of success is $p = P(X_i = 1) = A_A$. The expected value of $X_i$ is $E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot P(X_i=1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_i=0) = A_A$.\n\nThe total number of points hitting the compartment, $P_{comp}$, is the sum of these random variables: $P_{comp} = \\sum_{i=1}^{P_T} X_i$.\nThe point fraction, $P_P$, is defined as the fraction of test points that hit the compartment:\n$$P_P = \\frac{P_{comp}}{P_T}$$\nTo demonstrate that $P_P$ is an unbiased estimator for $A_A$, we compute its expected value:\n$$E[P_P] = E\\left[\\frac{P_{comp}}{P_T}\\right] = \\frac{1}{P_T} E[P_{comp}] = \\frac{1}{P_T} E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{P_T} X_i\\right]$$\nBy the linearity of expectation:\n$$E[P_P] = \\frac{1}{P_T} \\sum_{i=1}^{P_T} E[X_i] = \\frac{1}{P_T} \\sum_{i=1}^{P_T} A_A = \\frac{1}{P_T} (P_T \\cdot A_A) = A_A$$\nThus, the point fraction $P_P$ is an unbiased estimator for the areal fraction $A_A$. Let's denote this estimator as $\\hat{A}_A$.\n$$\\hat{A}_A = P_P = \\frac{P_{comp}}{P_T}$$\nThe problem asks for the volume fraction, denoted $V_v$. The **Principle of Delesse** (1847) states that for an isotropic, uniform, random (IUR) section through a 3D object, the volume fraction ($V_V$) of a component is equal to the areal fraction ($A_A$) of its profiles on the section plane.\n$$V_V = A_A$$\nThe notation $V_v$ is equivalent to $V_V$. Therefore, an unbiased estimator for the volume fraction $V_v$ is also the point fraction $P_P$.\n$$\\hat{V}_v = P_P = \\frac{P_{comp}}{P_T}$$\nThis is the derived unbiased estimator.\n\n**3. Calculation of Areal/Volume Fractions**\n\nWe apply the derived estimator to the provided data.\n- Total points, $P_T = 200$.\n- Points on white pulp, $P_{white} = 50$.\n- Points on red pulp, $P_{red} = 150$.\n\nFor the white pulp:\nThe estimated volume fraction $V_v(\\text{white})$ is calculated as the point fraction for the white pulp.\n$$\\hat{V}_v(\\text{white}) = P_P(\\text{white}) = \\frac{P_{white}}{P_T} = \\frac{50}{200} = 0.25$$\nRounding to four significant figures, this is $0.2500$.\n\nFor the red pulp:\nThe estimated volume fraction $V_v(\\text{red})$ is calculated as the point fraction for the red pulp.\n$$\\hat{V}_v(\\text{red}) = P_P(\\text{red}) = \\frac{P_{red}}{P_T} = \\frac{150}{200} = 0.75$$\nRounding to four significant figures, this is $0.7500$.\n\nThe results are to be reported in the order $V_v(\\text{white})$ followed by $V_v(\\text{red})$.\nThe final values are $0.2500$ and $0.7500$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.2500 & 0.7500\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4931160"}, {"introduction": "While we can distinguish red and white pulp with basic stains, the white pulp itself contains intricate microanatomical zones essential for adaptive immunity.

In canonical spleen microanatomy, the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath (PALS) is the T cell zone directly enveloping the central arteriole, B cell follicles surround the PALS within the white pulp, and the marginal zone (MZ) composed in part of CD169-positive macrophages encircles the follicle at the white pulp–red pulp interface.\n\nYou are provided two panels from the same specimen, each with its own calibrated scale bar. Panel A is a low-magnification field used to measure follicle diameter; Panel B is a higher-magnification inset used to measure the PALS thickness and the marginal zone radial thickness.

Therefore, the $CD3$-positive region represents the $PALS$.\n- The follicle is defined as a B cell follicle. The problem states that $B220$ (an epitope of $CD45R$) is used to label B lymphocytes. Consequently, the $B220$-positive region corresponds to the B cell follicle.\n- The marginal zone ($MZ$) is described as containing $CD169$-positive metallophilic macrophages. The marker $CD169$ ($Siglec-1$) is used to label these cells.

We will approach this by establishing a physical model for cell transit, grounded in fluid and solid mechanics principles.\n\n### 1. Fundamental Principles and Scaling Analysis\n\nThe transit of an RBC through a constriction narrower than its diameter ($h = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}  2R = 6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) is a complex process involving large cell deformation and fluid-structure interaction. The total transit time, $t_{transit}$, is governed by the driving pressure $\\Delta P$ and the resistance to flow, which is composed of the fluid's viscosity $\\mu$ and the cell's own deformability, characterized by its shear modulus $G$.\n\nA senescent RBC is stiffer than a reticulocyte, as indicated by their respective shear moduli:\n$G_s = 2.0\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$\n$G_r = 7.0\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$\nThe ratio of stiffness is $G_s / G_r = (2.0\\times 10^{-5}) / (7.0\\times 10^{-6}) \\approx 2.86$.\nIntuitively, a stiffer cell will deform less easily and offer more resistance to passage, resulting in a longer transit time. Therefore, we expect the transit time for a senescent cell, $t_s$, to be significantly longer than for a reticulocyte, $t_r$. That is, $t_s  t_r$.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Flow and Cell Transit\n\nLet's first estimate a baseline transit time by considering the flow of the suspending fluid alone. The average velocity $U_{avg}$ of a laminar flow through a wide rectangular slit of height $h$ and length $L$ under a pressure drop $\\Delta P$ is given by the Hele-Shaw flow approximation:\n$$ U_{avg} = \\frac{\\Delta P h^2}{12 \\mu L} $$\nPlugging in the given values:\n$$ U_{avg} = \\frac{(500\\,\\mathrm{Pa}) (2\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{12 (1.2\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}) (10\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})} = \\frac{2000 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot m^2}}{144 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s \\cdot m}} \\approx 13.9 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m/s} $$\nThe transit time for a fluid element would be:\n$$ t_{fluid} = \\frac{L}{U_{avg}} = \\frac{10\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{13.9 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}} \\approx 0.72 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 0.72\\,\\mathrm{ms} $$\nThis serves as a lower bound for the cell transit time. The presence of the cell adds significant resistance.\n\nThe additional resistance is due to the cell's deformation and the high shear rates in the thin fluid layer between the cell and the slit walls. For a fixed driving pressure $\\Delta P$, the cell's velocity $U_{cell}$ will be lower than $U_{avg}$. Biophysical models of cell transit through constrictions show that the added pressure drop or, equivalently, the transit time, has a strong dependence on the cell's membrane shear modulus $G$. For many relevant regimes, the transit time can be approximated by a linear relationship:\n$$ t_{transit} = k_1 + k_2 G $$\nHere, $k_1$ represents the transit time of a hypothetically infinitely deformable cell ($G=0$), which would be on the order of $t_{fluid}$, and the term $k_2 G$ represents the additional time required to overcome the elastic resistance of the cell membrane. The constant $k_2$ depends on geometry, fluid viscosity, and pressure. This model predicts that the transit time increases linearly with stiffness.\n\n### 3. Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nWe can now evaluate the given options based on this physical reasoning.\n\n**A. Reticulocyte transit time $\\sim 3$–$4\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, senescent RBC transit time $\\sim 9$–$10\\,\\mathrm{ms}$; senescent RBCs are preferentially retained in the red pulp cords and sinusoids.**\n\n*   **Transit Times:** Let's test if these values are consistent with our linear scaling model.\n    Let $t_r \\approx 3.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ (average of $3-4\\,\\mathrm{ms}$) for $G_r = 7.0\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$.\n    Let $t_s \\approx 9.5\\,\\mathrmms$ (average of $9-10\\,\\mathrmms$) for $G_s = 2.0\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$.\n    The ratio of transit times is $t_s/t_r \\approx 9.5/3.5 \\approx 2.71$. This is very close to the ratio of shear moduli, $G_s/G_r \\approx 2.86$. This suggests that the time added due to stiffness ($t_{transit} - k_1$) is indeed proportional to $G$.\n    We can solve for the constants in our model $t_{transit} = k_1 + k_2 G$:\n    $$ 3.5 \\times 10^{-3} = k_1 + k_2 (7.0 \\times 10^{-6}) $$\n    $$ 9.5 \\times 10^{-3} = k_1 + k_2 (2.0 \\times 10^{-5}) $$\n    Subtracting the first equation from the second:\n    $$ 6.0 \\times 10^{-3} = k_2 (2.0 \\times 10^{-5} - 7.0 \\times 10^{-6}) = k_2 (1.3 \\times 10^{-5}) $$\n    $$ k_2 = \\frac{6.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}}{1.3 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{N/m}} \\approx 4.62 \\times 10^2\\,\\mathrm{s \\cdot m/N} $$\n    Substituting $k_2$ back into the first equation:\n    $$ k_1 = 3.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s} - (4.62 \\times 10^2\\,\\mathrm{s \\cdot m/N})(7.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{N/m}) $$\n    $$ k_1 = 3.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s} - 3.23 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 0.27 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 0.27\\,\\mathrm{ms} $$\n    The value $k_1 = 0.27\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ is physically plausible, as it is of the same order of magnitude as our fluid transit time calculation ($0.72\\,\\mathrm{ms}$). The transit times in this option are therefore fully consistent with a well-established physical model.\n*   **Histological Outcome:** Senescent RBCs are stiffer and have a significantly longer transit time. The problem states the red pulp is a mechanical filter that retains cells with impaired deformability. Thus, senescent RBCs will be preferentially retained. This statement is correct.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**\n\n**B. Reticulocyte transit time $\\sim 12\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, senescent RBC transit time $\\sim 6\\,\\mathrm{ms}$; reticulocytes are preferentially retained in the red pulp.**\n\n*   **Transit Times:** This option claims $t_r  t_s$. This contradicts the fundamental principle that stiffer cells (senescent) should have longer transit times than more compliant cells (reticulocytes).\n*   **Histological Outcome:** This statement is also incorrect. Reticulocytes are generally more deformable than mature RBCs, and vastly more so than senescent cells. They would not be preferentially retained over senescent cells.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\n**C. Both populations transit in $\\sim 0.7\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, with negligible differences; retention is equivalent for both and unrelated to deformability.**\n\n*   **Transit Times:** A transit time of $\\sim 0.7\\,\\mathrmms$ is what we calculated for the fluid alone. It is physically impossible for a large, deformable cell to transit in the same time as the fluid it displaces, without any added resistance. The statement of \"negligible differences\" is contradicted by the nearly threefold difference in shear modulus.\n*   **Histological Outcome:** The claim that retention is unrelated to deformability contradicts the given biological premise that the red pulp is a mechanical filter.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\n**D. Reticulocyte transit time $\\sim 3$–$4\\,\\mathrmms$, senescent RBC transit time $\\sim 8$–$9\\,\\mathrm{ms}$; preferential retention occurs in the white pulp rather than the red pulp.**\n\n*   **Transit Times:** The transit times are plausible and similar to option A.\n*   **Histological Outcome:** The statement that retention occurs in the white pulp is explicitly contradicted by the problem description: \"the white pulp is organized as lymphoid tissue that does not serve as a mechanical filter for circulating RBCs\". The mechanical filtration occurs in the red pulp.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one that presents physically consistent transit times that scale correctly with cell stiffness and draws the correct conclusion about the fate of the cells based on the well-established physiological function of the spleen. The longer transit time of the stiffer, senescent RBCs leads to their preferential capture and removal in the mechanical filter of the red pulp.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4931172"}]}
