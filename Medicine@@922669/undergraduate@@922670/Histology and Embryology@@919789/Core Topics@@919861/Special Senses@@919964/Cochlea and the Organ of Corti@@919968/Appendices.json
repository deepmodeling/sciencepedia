Sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na$^+$/K$^+$-ATPase) is typically basolateral and establishes a sodium ion gradient used by secondary active cotransporters.\niii. The sodium-potassium-$2$ chloride cotransporter (NKCC$1$) is classically basolateral in secretory epithelia to accumulate potassium ion and chloride ion.\niv. Tight junctions define compartments by limiting paracellular ion flux.\nv.

The given ion concentrations, potential values, and transport protein identities (e.g., Na$^+$/K$^+$-ATPase, NKCC$1$, KCNQ$1$) are factually correct and form the basis of current understanding of cochlear function. The \"fundamental laws\" provided are standard textbook principles of cell and membrane physiology.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a set of constraints (physiological state of endolymph, rules of transport) and asks for the evaluation of several proposed models (the options) against these constraints. A single best-fit solution is expected.\n*   **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology. Terms like `apical`, `basolateral`, `tight junctions`, and specific protein names have clear, unambiguous definitions in cell biology.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the invalidity flaws. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, and asks a non-trivial question based on established biological facts.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action ###\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived by applying the given principles to construct a correct model and then evaluating each option against this model.\n\n## Solution Derivation ##\n\nThe objective is to formulate a model for the stria vascularis that explains the generation of endolymph, characterized by $[\\mathrm{K^+}] \\approx 150 \\, \\mathrm{mM}$, $[\\mathrm{Na^+}] \\approx 1 \\, \\mathrm{mM}$, and an endocochlear potential (EP) of $+80$ to $+100 \\, \\mathrm{mV}$. The model must involve the marginal, intermediate, and basal cells, and be consistent with the five provided principles.\n\n1.  **Barrier Function:**\n    *   Principle (v) dictates that the intrastrial capillaries must have a continuous, non-fenestrated endothelium with tight junctions. This forms a blood-stria barrier, preventing free leakage of plasma (which has high $[\\mathrm{Na^+}]$ and low $[\\mathrm{K^+}]$) into the strial tissue.\n    *   Principle (iv) states that tight junctions create compartments. The marginal cells line the scala media, so they must have apical tight junctions to separate the unique endolymph from the intrastrial fluid compartment.\n\n2.  **Potassium ($K^+$) Secretion:**\n    *   The final step must be the secretion of $\\mathrm{K^+}$ into the endolymph. This occurs across the apical membrane of the marginal cells, which face the endolymph.\n    *   To achieve a net flux of $\\mathrm{K^+}$ into the endolymph against both a concentration gradient (intracellular $[\\mathrm{K^+}]$ is high, but endolymph $[\\mathrm{K^+}]$ is also very high, $\\approx 150 \\, \\mathrm{mM}$) and a large positive electrical potential ($+80 \\, \\mathrm{mV}$), two conditions are necessary: (a) a very high intracellular $[\\mathrm{K^+}]$ in the marginal cell to provide a chemical driving force, and (b) an apical channel to mediate the movement. The primary channel responsible for this is the KCNQ$1$/KCNE$1$ potassium channel complex.\n\n3.  **Potassium ($K^+$) Loading into Marginal Cells:**\n    *   To maintain a high intracellular $[\\mathrm{K^+}]$ for secretion, marginal cells must actively take up $\\mathrm{K^+}$ across their basolateral membrane (facing the intrastrial space).\n    *   Principle (ii) positions the Na$^+$/K$^+$-ATPase on the basolateral membrane. This pump actively transports $\\mathrm{K^+}$ into the cell and $\\mathrm{Na^+}$ out, consuming ATP and establishing the primary gradients.\n    *   Principle (iii) positions the NKCC$1$ cotransporter on the basolateral membrane of secretory epithelia. Driven by the favorable $\\mathrm{Na^+}$ gradient (created by the Na$^+$/K$^+$-ATPase), NKCC$1$ transports $\\mathrm{Na^+}$, $\\mathrm{K^+}$, and $2\\mathrm{Cl^-}$ into the cell. This is a major mechanism for accumulating intracellular $\\mathrm{K^+}$.\n    *   The operation of these basolateral transporters requires ion recycling. The $\\mathrm{Na^+}$ that enters via NKCC$1$ is extruded by the Na$^+$/K$^+$-ATPase. The $\\mathrm{Cl^-}$ that accumulates via NKCC$1$ must exit across the basolateral membrane through a chloride channel (e.g., a member of the ClC family) to maintain the cell's membrane potential and electroneutrality.\n\n4.  **Generation of the Endocochlear Potential (EP):**\n    *   The $+80$ to $+100 \\, \\mathrm{mV}$ EP is a complex phenomenon. It is not generated solely across the apical membrane of the marginal cell. The stria vascularis itself maintains an internal, positively charged \"intrastrial\" fluid compartment.\n    *   The EP is the sum of two potentials: the potential across the apical membrane of the marginal cell and the potential of the intrastrial space relative to perilymph.\n    *   The intrastrial potential is largely generated by the activity of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel KCNJ$10$ (also known as Kir$4.1$). This channel is highly expressed in the intermediate cells. It is believed to pass a $\\mathrm{K^+}$ current that hyperpolarizes the cell membrane, effectively creating a positive potential in the adjacent extracellular space (the intrastrial space). The intermediate cells are coupled via gap junctions to basal cells and fibrocytes of the spiral ligament, forming a syncytium that recycles $\\mathrm{K^+}$ ions that have exited the hair cells during mechanotransduction.\n\n**Summary of the Correct Model:**\n*   **Capillaries:** Continuous, non-fenestrated, forming a blood-stria barrier.\n*   **Marginal Cells:** Form the apical-most layer facing endolymph, sealed by tight junctions.\n    *   Apical membrane: KCNQ$1$/KCNE$1$ channels for $\\mathrm{K^+}$ secretion.\n    *   Basolateral membrane: Na$^+$/K$^+$-ATPase, NKCC$1$ cotransporter for $\\mathrm{K^+}$ uptake, and a $\\mathrm{Cl^-}$ channel for recycling.\n*   **Intermediate Cells:** Located between marginal and basal cells, contacting capillaries. Express KCNJ$10$ (Kir$4.1$) to help generate the positive potential of the intrastrial space.\n*   **Basal Cells:** Form the basal-most layer, separated from the spiral ligament by tight junctions. Participate in the gap-junctional syncytium for $\\mathrm{K^+}$ recycling.\n\nThis derived model will now be used to evaluate the options.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis ##\n\n**A. The stria vascularis contains a dense, anastomosing capillary bed with continuous, non-fenestrated endothelium and tight junctions, embedded within an intrastrial compartment adjacent to intermediate cells.

Intermediate cells are melanocyte-like and contact the capillaries; they express the inwardly rectifying potassium ion channel KCNJ$10$ (Kir$4.1$), which contributes to the positive endocochlear potential in the intrastrial space.

Bulk leakage of plasma would destroy, not create, the endolymph composition.\n*   Marginal cells face endolymph, not perilymph.\n*   `apical NKCC$1$` and `apical Na$^+$/K$^+$-ATPase` violate the typical basolateral localization described in principles (ii) and (iii) for this type of epithelium. Furthermore, apical localization would move ions in the wrong directions.\n*   Basolateral `KCNQ$1$/KCNE$1$` is the wrong localization for secretion into endolymph.\n*   Generation of a positive potential by ENaC is incorrect; ENaC is a $\\mathrm{Na^+}$ absorption channel that would generate a negative luminal potential.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The capillary network consists of discontinuous, sinusoid-like vessels to maximize exchange. Basal cells line the endolymph and contain apical KCNQ$1$/KCNE$1$ to secrete potassium ion into the scala media; intermediate cells form the principal tight junction barrier with endolymph and do not contribute to ion transport; the maintenance of low sodium ion concentration and the endocochlear potential is attributed to apical pendrin-mediated chloride-bicarbonate exchange in marginal cells.**\n\nThis option incorrectly describes the anatomy and molecular machinery:\n*   `discontinuous, sinusoid-like vessels` violates principle (v).\n*   `Basal cells line the endolymph` is anatomically false; marginal cells do.\n*   `intermediate cells form the principal tight junction barrier with endolymph` is also false; marginal cells do.\n*   Attributing the EP to `pendrin` is incorrect; pendrin is an anion exchanger and is not the source of the large positive potential.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The stria vascularis capillary bed has continuous endothelium with tight junctions; marginal cells face endolymph but lack basolateral Na$^+$/K$^+$-ATPase, relying instead on apical Na$^+$/K$^+$-ATPase to drive potassium ion secretion. Intermediate cells express the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) to generate the endocochlear potential, and basal cells are the principal source of NKCC$1$ for potassium ion uptake from perilymph.**\n\nThis option presents a physiologically non-viable model:\n*   `apical Na$^+$/K$^+$-ATPase` violates principle (ii). Critically, an apical pump would pump $\\mathrm{K^+}$ *from* endolymph *into* the cell and $\\mathrm{Na^+}$ *out* of the cell *into* endolymph, which is precisely the opposite of what is required.\n*   `CFTR` (a $\\mathrm{Cl^-}$ channel) is not the primary generator of the positive EP; KCNJ$10$ is.\n*   Placing `NKCC$1$` on basal cells as the principal source for uptake from perilymph mislocates the primary engine of $\\mathrm{K^+}$ loading for secretion, which is on the marginal cells.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4875380"}, {"introduction": "With the electrochemical stage set by the stria vascularis, the next step is to understand how a hair cell converts a mechanical stimulus into an electrical signal.

The apical MET pathway is represented by a conductance $g$ connected to a battery at the endocochlear potential (EP), $V_{\\mathrm{EP}}$, because endolymph is maintained at a positive potential relative to perilymph by the stria vascularis. The basolateral potassium pathway is represented by a conductance $g_{K}$ connected to a battery at the intracellular potassium equilibrium potential $E_{K}$.

Express your answer in $\\mathrm{mV}$.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the steady-state receptor potential, $V_m$, of an inner hair cell. The cell membrane is modeled as an electrical node with three parallel conductive pathways. The analysis is based on two foundational principles: Ohm's law for each pathway and the conservation of charge at the membrane node.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing equation based on the conservation of charge. At steady state, the capacitive current is zero. According to Kirchhoff's Current Law, the algebraic sum of currents flowing out of the intracellular node must be zero. Let the three currents be $I_{\\mathrm{MET}}$ (Mechanoelectrical Transduction), $I_K$ (potassium), and $I_L$ (leak). The conservation of charge is expressed as:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{MET}} + I_K + I_L = 0$$\n\nNext, we define each current using Ohm's law in the form $I = g \\Delta V$, where $g$ is the conductance and $\\Delta V$ is the driving potential difference across the conductance. We consistently define the driving potential as the intracellular potential minus the effective extracellular potential for each pathway, so that positive current represents an outward flow of positive charge.\n\n$1$. The apical MET pathway has a conductance $g$ and is situated between the intracellular space at potential $V_m$ and the endolymph at the endocochlear potential $V_{\\mathrm{EP}}$. The current through this pathway is:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{MET}} = g (V_m - V_{\\mathrm{EP}})$$\n\n$2$. The basolateral potassium pathway has a conductance $g_K$ and a reversal potential $E_K$. This pathway connects the intracellular space at potential $V_m$ to the perilymph, which is the reference potential ($0$ $\\mathrm{mV}$). The Nernst potential $E_K$ acts as a battery in series with the conductance. The driving potential across the conductance is thus $(V_m - E_K)$. The current is:\n$$I_K = g_K (V_m - E_K)$$\n\n$3$. The passive leak pathway has a conductance $g_L$ and a reversal potential $E_L$. Similar to the potassium pathway, it connects the intracellular space to the perilymph. The current is:\n$$I_L = g_L (V_m - E_L)$$\n\nNow, we substitute these three current expressions into the charge conservation equation:\n$$g(V_m - V_{\\mathrm{EP}}) + g_K(V_m - E_K) + g_L(V_m - E_L) = 0$$\n\nTo find the steady-state membrane potential $V_m$, we must solve this linear equation for $V_m$.

The hair bundle stiffness, $k_b$, remains unchanged.\nThe new effective stiffness of the series combination, $k_{\\mathrm{eff, new}}$, is therefore:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff, new}} = \\frac{k_b k_{t, \\mathrm{new}}}{k_b + k_{t, \\mathrm{new}}} = \\frac{k_b (s k_t)}{k_b + s k_t} $$\nThe new best frequency, $f_{\\mathrm{new}}$, is the new resonance frequency:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{eff, new}}}{m}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{m} \\left( \\frac{s k_b k_t}{k_b + s k_t} \\right)} $$\nWe are given the following values: $k_b = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{N/m}$, $k_t = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{N/m}$, $s = 1.30$, and $m = 5.0 \\times 10^{-13} \\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\nFirst, calculate the new effective stiffness, $k_{\\mathrm{eff, new}}$:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff, new}} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{N/m}) \\times (1.30 \\times 2.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{N/m})}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{N/m} + (1.30 \\times 2.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{N/m})} = \\frac{2.6 \\times 10^{-6} \\ (\\mathrm{N/m})^2}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{N/m} + 2.6 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{N/m}} $$\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff, new}} = \\frac{2.6 \\times 10^{-6}}{3.6 \\times 10^{-3}} \\ \\mathrm{N/m} = \\frac{13}{18} \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{N/m} \\approx 7.222 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{N/m} $$\nNow, we calculate $f_{\\mathrm{new}}$:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{13}{18} \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{N/m}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-13} \\ \\mathrm{kg}}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{13}{90} \\times 10^{10} \\ \\mathrm{s^{-2}}} \\approx 6047.57 \\ \\mathrm{Hz} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in kilohertz (kHz), rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{new}} \\approx 6.04757 \\ \\mathrm{kHz} \\approx 6.048 \\ \\mathrm{kHz} $$\n\nNext, we determine the multiplicative change in the OHC gain, $r_G$. The problem states that the small-signal gain, $G$, is proportional to the shear transfer coefficient from the imposed shear $\\Delta$ to the hair-bundle deflection $\\delta_b$. This transfer coefficient is $C = \\delta_b / \\Delta$.\n$$ G \\propto C = \\frac{\\delta_b}{\\Delta} $$\nFor two springs in series subjected to a total displacement $\\Delta$, the force $F$ across each spring is identical.\n$$ F = k_b \\delta_b = k_t \\delta_t $$\nwhere $\\delta_t$ is the deflection of the tectorial membrane spring. The total displacement is the sum of the individual deflections:\n$$ \\Delta = \\delta_b + \\delta_t $$\nFrom the force equality, we express $\\delta_t$ in terms of $\\delta_b$: $\\delta_t = \\frac{k_b}{k_t}\\delta_b$. Substituting this into the displacement sum:\n$$ \\Delta = \\delta_b + \\frac{k_b}{k_t}\\delta_b = \\delta_b \\left( 1 + \\frac{k_b}{k_t} \\right) = \\delta_b \\left( \\frac{k_t + k_b}{k_t} \\right) $$\nThe transfer coefficient is then:\n$$ C = \\frac{\\delta_b}{\\Delta} = \\frac{k_t}{k_b + k_t} $$\nThe multiplicative change in gain, $r_G$, is the ratio of the new gain $G_{\\mathrm{new}}$ to the old gain $G_{\\mathrm{old}}$.\n$$ r_G = \\frac{G_{\\mathrm{new}}}{G_{\\mathrm{old}}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{new}}}{C_{\\mathrm{old}}} $$\nThe old transfer coefficient is $C_{\\mathrm{old}} = \\frac{k_t}{k_b + k_t}$.\nThe new transfer coefficient, with $k_t$ replaced by $k_{t, \\mathrm{new}} = s k_t$, is $C_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\frac{s k_t}{k_b + s k_t}$.\nThe ratio $r_G$ is:\n$$ r_G = \\frac{\\frac{s k_t}{k_b + s k_t}}{\\frac{k_t}{k_b + k_t}} = \\frac{s k_t}{k_b + s k_t} \\cdot \\frac{k_b + k_t}{k_t} = s \\frac{k_b + k_t}{k_b + s k_t} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ r_G = 1.30 \\times \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{N/m} + 2.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{N/m}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{N/m} + 1.30 \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{N/m})} $$\nThe factors of $10^{-3}$ cancel out:\n$$ r_G = 1.30 \\times \\frac{1.0 + 2.0}{1.0 + 1.30 \\times 2.0} = 1.30 \\times \\frac{3.0}{1.0 + 2.6} = 1.30 \\times \\frac{3.0}{3.6} = 1.30 \\times \\frac{5}{6} $$\n$$ r_G = \\frac{6.5}{6} \\approx 1.08333... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ r_G \\approx 1.083 $$\nThe final answer is a two-entry row matrix containing $f_{\\mathrm{new}}$ in units of kHz and the dimensionless factor $r_G$, both rounded to four significant figures.\n$f_{\\mathrm{new}} = 6.048 \\ \\mathrm{kHz}$\n$r_G = 1.083$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n6.048 & 1.083\n\\end{bmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4875280"}]}
