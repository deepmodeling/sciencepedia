The fundamental principles are stated as Snell's law, the paraxial approximation, and the geometry of a spherical surface.\n\nLet us model the anterior corneal surface as a single spherical interface separating two media with refractive indices $n_1 = n_{\\text{air}}$ and $n_2 = n_{\\text{cornea}}$. The surface has a radius of curvature $r_a$. Let the optical axis be the axis of symmetry of the surface. Light propagates from left to right. The vertex of the surface, where it intersects the optical axis, is denoted by $V$. The center of curvature is at $C$, a distance $r_a$ to the right of $V$. According to the specified sign convention, $r_a$ is positive.\n\nConsider a paraxial ray of light, initially in air, parallel to the optical axis at a height $h$ from it. This ray represents part of a collimated beam. The ray strikes the surface at a point $P$. At point $P$, the ray is refracted into the cornea. The line normal to the surface at $P$ is the line that passes through $P$ and the center of curvature $C$.\n\nLet $\\theta_1$ be the angle of incidence and $\\theta_2$ be the angle of refraction. These are the angles between the ray and the normal at $P$. Snell's law states:\n$$n_1 \\sin \\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin \\theta_2$$\nFor paraxial rays, the angles are small, so we use the small-angle approximation $\\sin \\theta \\approx \\theta$. Snell's law becomes:\n$$n_1 \\theta_1 = n_2 \\theta_2$$\nSubstituting $n_1 = n_{\\text{air}}$ and $n_2 = n_{\\text{cornea}}$, we have:\n$$n_{\\text{air}} \\theta_1 = n_{\\text{cornea}} \\theta_2$$\nNow, we must express $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ in terms of the geometric parameters of the system. Let $\\alpha$ be the angle that the normal line $PC$ makes with the optical axis. Since the incident ray is parallel to the optical axis, the angle of incidence is equal to $\\alpha$. Thus, $\\theta_1 = \\alpha$.\n\nAfter refraction, the ray bends towards the optical axis and intersects it at the secondary focal point, $F_2$. The distance from the vertex $V$ to this point is the secondary focal length, $f_2$. Let $\\phi'$ be the angle that the refracted ray makes with the optical axis.\n\nFrom the geometry of the triangle $\\triangle PCF_2$, the angle $\\alpha$ is an exterior angle. The interior opposite angles are $\\theta_2$ and $\\phi'$. Therefore, we have the relation:\n$$\\alpha = \\theta_2 + \\phi'$$\nwhich can be rearranged to find $\\theta_2$:\n$$\\theta_2 = \\alpha - \\phi'$$\nWe now have expressions for $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ in terms of geometric angles $\\alpha$ and $\\phi'$. We can substitute these into the paraxial form of Snell's law:\n$$n_{\\text{air}} (\\alpha) = n_{\\text{cornea}} (\\alpha - \\phi')$$\nIn the paraxial (or Gaussian) approximation, the height $h$ is small compared to $r_a$ and $f_2$.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe transport of solvent across a semipermeable membrane under the influence of hydrostatic and osmotic pressure gradients is described by the principles of linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics. For a single membrane, the volume flux per unit area, $J_w$, is linearly proportional to the driving forces. The appropriate relation is a form of the Starling equation, derived from the Kedem-Katchalsky formalism:\n$$J_w = L_p (\\Delta P_{\\text{effective}})$$\nwhere $L_p$ is the hydraulic conductivity of the membrane and $\\Delta P_{\\text{effective}}$ is the net effective pressure difference across it.\n\nThe effective pressure is the sum of the hydrostatic pressure difference, $\\Delta P$, and the effective osmotic pressure difference. The osmotic pressure difference, $\\Delta \\pi$, is generated by solutes, but only to the extent that they are reflected by the membrane. This is quantified by the reflection coefficient, $\\sigma$. The effective osmotic pressure driving water flow is $-\\sigma \\Delta \\pi$. The negative sign is crucial: an osmotic pressure difference drives water from the region of lower osmotic pressure (lower solute concentration) to the region of higher osmotic pressure (higher solute concentration).\n\nLet us verify the sign convention. The flux $J_w$ is positive from stroma to aqueous humor. The pressure differences are defined as $\\Delta X = X_{\\text{stroma}} - X_{\\text{aqueous}}$.\n1.  A positive hydrostatic pressure difference, $\\Delta P > 0$ ($P_{\\text{stroma}} > P_{\\text{aqueous}}$), drives flow from stroma to aqueous. This corresponds to a positive flux. Thus, the hydrostatic term is $L_p \\Delta P$.\n2.  A positive osmotic pressure difference, $\\Delta \\pi > 0$ ($\\pi_{\\text{stroma}} > \\pi_{\\text{aqueous}}$), means the stroma is hyperosmotic. This drives water from the aqueous humor into the stroma. This corresponds to a negative flux. Thus, the osmotic term must be $-L_p \\sigma \\Delta \\pi$.\n\nCombining these terms, the equation for the solvent flux is:\n$$J_w = L_p (\\Delta P - \\sigma \\Delta \\pi)$$\nThis completes the derivation requested in the problem statement.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $J_w$. First, the osmotic pressure difference $\\Delta \\pi$ must be calculated from the given osmolarity difference using the van 't Hoff relation, $\\pi = R T c_{\\text{osm}}$.\nThe osmolarity difference is given as $\\Delta c_{\\text{osm}} = c_{\\text{osm,stroma}} - c_{\\text{osm,aqueous}} = -0.010 \\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.
