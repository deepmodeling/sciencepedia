This is a well-documented biological process. The given values—a path length of $1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and a migration speed of $25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{h}$—are well within the plausible physiological range for cell migration in embryonic tissues. The concept of using a perturbation model to reduce cell motility is a standard experimental approach in cell and developmental biology.

It provides all necessary data (distance, baseline speed, and percentage speed reduction) to calculate the two requested quantities (baseline time and perturbed time). The relationship between distance, speed, and time is fundamental, ensuring a unique solution. The simplifying assumptions (constant speed, fixed path) are explicitly stated and are common in modeling biological processes to make them tractable.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective scientific language.

It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is based on the fundamental definition of constant speed, $v$, which is the ratio of the distance traversed, $d$, to the time elapsed, $t$. This relationship is expressed as:\n$$v = \\frac{d}{t}$$\nTo find the time of traversal, this equation is rearranged to:\n$$t = \\frac{d}{v}$$\nIn this problem, the distance $d$ is the fixed path length $L = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nA critical first step is to ensure unit consistency. The path length is given in millimeters ($mm$) and the speed is given in micrometers per hour ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{h}$). We will convert the path length to micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) to match the units of speed.\nThe conversion factor is $1\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 1000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$L = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\times \\frac{1000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{1\\,\\mathrm{mm}} = 1500\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the baseline arrival time, $t_{\\text{base}}$, using the baseline speed $v_{\\text{base}} = 25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{h}$.\n$$t_{\\text{base}} = \\frac{L}{v_{\\text{base}}} = \\frac{1500\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{h}}$$\nThe units of $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ cancel, leaving the time in hours ($\\mathrm{h}$), which is the required unit.\n$$t_{\\text{base}} = \\frac{1500}{25}\\,\\mathrm{h} = 60\\,\\mathrm{h}$$\n\nNext, we address the perturbation model. The migration speed is reduced by $20\\%$. The new, reduced speed, $v_{\\text{red}}$, is therefore $100\\% - 20\\% = 80\\%$ of the baseline speed.\n$$v_{\\text{red}} = v_{\\text{base}} \\times (1 - 0.20) = v_{\\text{base}} \\times 0.80$$\nSubstituting the value of $v_{\\text{base}}$:\n$$v_{\\text{red}} = 25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{h} \\times 0.80 = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{h}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the arrival time under the reduced-speed condition, $t_{\\text{red}}$, using the constant path length $L = 1500\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and the reduced speed $v_{\\text{red}}$.\n$$t_{\\text{red}} = \\frac{L}{v_{\\text{red}}} = \\frac{1500\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{h}}$$\n$$t_{\\text{red}} = \\frac{150}{2}\\,\\mathrm{h} = 75\\,\\mathrm{h}$$\n\nThus, the baseline arrival time is $60$ hours, and the arrival time under the reduced-speed condition is $75$ hours.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 60 & 75 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4879615"}, {"introduction": "How does a developing cell know its position and ultimate fate?

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of developmental biology and morphogen gradients, is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem provides a model for the one-dimensional concentration profile of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) as a function of distance $x$ from the source (the prechordal plate):\n$$c(x) = c_{0}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nHere, $c_0$ is the source concentration and $\\lambda$ is the characteristic length of the gradient.\n\nThe problem states that the repression of the transcription factor SIX3 occurs at a boundary position, denoted $x^{\\ast}$, where the SHH concentration $c(x)$ equals a specific threshold value. This threshold is defined by the dissociation constant $K_{d}$ of the SHH receptor. The condition defining the boundary is therefore:\n$$c(x^{\\ast}) = K_{d}$$\n\nTo derive an expression for $x^{\\ast}$, we substitute the expression for the concentration profile into the boundary condition:\n$$c_{0}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{\\lambda}\\right) = K_{d}$$\n\nOur goal is to solve this equation for $x^{\\ast}$. We begin by isolating the exponential term by dividing both sides by $c_{0}$:\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{\\lambda}\\right) = \\frac{K_{d}}{c_{0}}$$\n\nNext, we take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides to eliminate the exponential function:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{\\lambda}\\right)\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_{d}}{c_{0}}\\right)$$\n$$-\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{\\lambda} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_{d}}{c_{0}}\\right)$$\n\nUsing the logarithmic identity $\\ln(a/b) = -\\ln(b/a)$, we can rewrite the right side of the equation:\n$$-\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{\\lambda} = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{c_{0}}{K_{d}}\\right)$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $-1$ yields:\n$$\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{\\lambda} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_{0}}{K_{d}}\\right)$$\n\nFinally, we multiply by $\\lambda$ to obtain the expression for the repression boundary position $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$x^{\\ast} = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_{0}}{K_{d}}\\right)$$\nThis is the analytical expression for $x^{\\ast}$ in terms of the given parameters.\n\nNext, we evaluate $x^{\\ast}$ using the provided numerical values:\n$c_{0} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$K_{d} = 1\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$\\lambda = 120\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$x^{\\ast} = (120\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}) \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{1\\,\\mathrm{nM}}\\right)$$\n$$x^{\\ast} = 120 \\ln(10)\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value.

Therefore, if $\\lambda$ were to double, the boundary position $x^{\\ast}$ would also double.\n\nBiologically, the characteristic length $\\lambda$ determines the steepness of the morphogen gradient. A larger $\\lambda$ corresponds to a shallower, more spread-out gradient, meaning the SHH concentration decreases more slowly with distance from the source. Consequently, one would have to travel a greater distance from the source for the concentration to drop to the threshold level $K_d$. This confirms that an increase in $\\lambda$ leads to an increase in $x^{\\ast}$.\n\nCyclopia results from the failure of the midline structures, under the influence of SHH, to correctly divide the single embryonic eye field into two distinct optic vesicles. This failure is typically associated with insufficient SHH signaling in the ventral forebrain. A doubling of $\\lambda$ would cause the SHH gradient to become broader, extending effective signaling over a greater distance. This enhanced and more widespread SHH signal would more robustly suppress the medial eye field identity (e.g., by repressing `PAX6` at the midline), thus promoting a more definitive separation of the eye fields.

The Hill coefficient is given as $n=2$. Thus, the fractional occupancy of the target gene's promoter is:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[P]^2}{K_d^2 + [P]^2}\n$$\nAccording to Principle (ii), the activation of the downstream target gene, which we denote as $A$, is proportional to the fractional occupancy $\\theta$. We can write this relationship as:\n$$\nA = c \\cdot \\theta = c \\cdot \\frac{[P]^2}{K_d^2 + [P]^2}\n$$\nwhere $c$ is a constant of proportionality that depends on factors such as the maximum transcription rate.\n\nFirst, we establish the baseline (wild-type) activation, $A_{\\text{base}}$. Let the baseline concentration of PAX6 be $[P]_{\\text{base}}$. At this concentration, the activation is:\n$$\nA_{\\text{base}} = c \\cdot \\frac{[P]_{\\text{base}}^2}{K_d^2 + [P]_{\\text{base}}^2}\n$$\nThe problem states (Principle (iii)) that the effective dissociation constant $K_d$ is equal to the baseline concentration, i.e., $K_d = [P]_{\\text{base}}$. Substituting this into the equation for $A_{\\text{base}}$:\n$$\nA_{\\text{base}} = c \\cdot \\frac{[P]_{\\text{base}}^2}{([P]_{\\text{base}})^2 + [P]_{\\text{base}}^2} = c \\cdot \\frac{[P]_{\\text{base}}^2}{2[P]_{\\text{base}}^2} = c \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the definition of $K_d$ for a Hill system, where occupancy is $0.5$ when the ligand concentration equals $K_d$.\n\nNext, we consider the case where the PAX6 dosage is reduced.
