The problem is scientifically grounded in the biophysics of sensory transduction in the inner ear, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. All parameters, such as ionic concentrations and electrical potentials, are within physiologically realistic ranges for the vestibular system. The problem asks for a direct application of fundamental principles, namely the definitions of electrochemical driving force and the Nernst equilibrium potential. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe primary objective is to calculate the electrochemical driving force on potassium ions ($\\mathrm{K}^+$) passing through the mechanotransduction (MET) channels situated at the apical membrane of the vestibular hair cell. The driving force ($DF$) on an ion is defined as the difference between the membrane potential ($V_{mem}$) and the equilibrium potential for that ion ($E_{ion}$), calculated via the Nernst equation.\n$$DF_{ion} = V_{mem} - E_{ion}$$\nIn this specific context, the ion is $\\mathrm{K}^+$, and the membrane of interest is the apical membrane, which separates the intracellular cytosol of the hair cell from the extracellular endolymph. The equation is therefore:\n$$DF_K = V_{apical} - E_K$$\n\nFirst, we must determine the electrical potential across the apical membrane, $V_{apical}$. This potential is the difference between the potential inside the cell, $V_{cell}$, and the potential in the endolymph, $V_{endo}$, both measured relative to a common reference, which is the perilymph.\n$$V_{apical} = V_{cell} - V_{endo}$$\nThe problem provides the following values relative to perilymph:\nThe intracellular potential of the hair cell soma is $V_{cell} = V_m = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. We assume the cell is isopotential, so this value applies to the apical cytoplasm as well.\nThe potential of the endolymph is $V_{endo} = +5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\nSubstituting these values, we find the apical membrane potential:\n$$V_{apical} = (-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}) - (+5\\,\\mathrm{mV}) = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the Nernst equilibrium potential for potassium, $E_K$, across the apical membrane. The Nernst equation for a monovalent cation like $\\mathrm{K}^+$ (with valence $z=+1$) is:\n$$E_K = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^+]_{out}}{[\\mathrm{K}^+]_{in}}\\right)$$\nThe constants are the ideal gas constant $R \\approx 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, the Faraday constant $F \\approx 96485\\,\\mathrm{C} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, and the given absolute temperature $T = 310\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The ionic concentrations across the apical membrane are:\nExtracellular concentration (in endolymph): $[\\mathrm{K}^+]_{out} = [\\mathrm{K}^+]_{\\mathrm{end}} = 150\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\nIntracellular concentration (in cytosol): $[\\mathrm{K}^+]_{in} = [\\mathrm{K}^+]_{\\mathrm{cell}} = 140\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n\nWe first compute the term $\\frac{RT}{zF}$, which converts the chemical potential from the concentration ratio into an electrical potential.

The first task requires the calculation of the gravitational force on a single otoconium. The second task requires the symbolic derivation of the shear stress and resulting deflection for an ensemble of otoconia under a small head tilt.\n\n**Task 1: Gravitational Force on a Single Otoconium**\n\nThe task is to derive and compute the gravitational force, or weight, $F_g$, acting on a single otoconium. We are instructed to start from the fundamental definitions of mass and weight.\n\nThe mass $m$ of an object is defined as the product of its density $\\rho$ and volume $V$:\n$$m = \\rho V$$\nThe weight $F_g$ of an object is the gravitational force acting on its mass, given by the product of its mass $m$ and the acceleration due to gravity $g$:\n$$F_g = m g$$\nCombining these two definitions, we obtain the expression for the weight in terms of density, volume, and gravitational acceleration:\n$$F_g = \\rho V g$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n-   Volume: $V = 1000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{3}$\n-   Density: $\\rho = 2.7\\,\\mathrm{g/cm}^{3}$\n-   Gravitational acceleration: $g = 9.81\\,\\mathrm{m/s}^{2}$\n\nTo calculate the force in the SI unit of Newtons ($N$), all quantities must be converted to base SI units: kilograms ($kg$), meters ($m$), and seconds ($s$).\n\nFirst, we convert the volume $V$ from cubic micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{3}$) to cubic meters ($\\mathrm{m}^{3}$).\nThe prefix micro- ($\\mu$) represents a factor of $10^{-6}$.\n$$1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nTherefore, a cubic micrometer is:\n$$(1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m})^3 = (10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})^3 = 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}$$\nThe given volume is:\n$$V = 1000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{3} = 10^3 \\times (10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}) = 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}$$\n\nNext, we convert the density $\\rho$ from grams per cubic centimeter ($\\mathrm{g/cm}^{3}$) to kilograms per cubic meter ($\\mathrm{kg/m}^{3}$).\nThe conversions for mass and length are:\n$$1\\,\\mathrm{g} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$$\n$$1\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\implies 1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{3} = (10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m})^3 = 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for density:\n$$\\rho = 2.7\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{cm}^{3}} = 2.7 \\times \\frac{10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kg}}{10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}} = 2.7 \\times 10^3\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{kg}}{\\mathrm{m}^{3}}$$\n\nThe gravitational acceleration $g=9.81\\,\\mathrm{m/s}^{2}$ is already in SI units.\n\nNow we can substitute these SI unit values into the equation for gravitational force:\n$$F_g = \\rho V g = \\left(2.7 \\times 10^3\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{kg}}{\\mathrm{m}^{3}}\\right) \\times (10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}) \\times \\left(9.81\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{s}^{2}}\\right)$$\n$$F_g = (2.7 \\times 9.81) \\times (10^3 \\times 10^{-15})\\,\\mathrm{N}$$\n$$F_g = 26.487 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{N}$$\nExpressing this in standard scientific notation:\n$$F_g = 2.6487 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{N}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$F_g \\approx 2.65 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{N}$$\n\n**Task 2: Symbolic Derivation of Shear Stress and Deflection**\n\nThis task requires deriving symbolic expressions for the shear stress $\\tau(\\theta)$ and the steady deflection $\\delta(\\theta)$ of the otolithic membrane.\n\nConsider an ensemble of $N$ identical otoconia distributed over a macular area $A$. The total mass of the otoconial layer is $M_{tot} = N m = N \\rho V$. The total weight of this layer is $W_{tot} = M_{tot} g = N \\rho V g$.\n\nWhen the head is tilted by an angle $\\theta$ relative to the normal of the macular plane, the total weight $W_{tot}$ can be resolved into two components: one perpendicular (normal) to the plane and one parallel (shear) to the plane. The shear component is responsible for the shear load on the hair bundles. The shear force $F_{shear}$ is given by:\n$$F_{shear} = W_{tot} \\sin(\\theta) = N \\rho V g \\sin(\\theta)$$\nShear stress, $\\tau$, is defined as the shear force per unit area. Thus, the shear stress exerted by the otoconial layer on the underlying epithelium is:\n$$\\tau(\\theta) = \\frac{F_{shear}}{A} = \\frac{N \\rho V g \\sin(\\theta)}{A}$$\nUsing the given definition of areal number density, $n = N/A$, the expression for shear stress becomes:\n$$\\tau(\\theta) = n \\rho V g \\sin(\\theta)$$\nFor small angles $\\theta$ (in radians), as specified in the problem, we can use the approximation $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$. The expression for shear stress then simplifies to a linear relationship with the tilt angle: $\\tau(\\theta) \\approx n \\rho V g \\theta$.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the steady deflection $\\delta(\\theta)$. This deflection arises from the passive mechanical properties of the otolithic membrane and hair bundle complex. The problem provides a linear shear stiffness per unit area, $K_s$. This parameter relates the restoring shear stress, $\\tau_{restore}$, generated by the complex to its deflection, $\\delta$.\n$$\\tau_{restore} = K_s \\delta$$\nAt steady state (static force balance), the applied shear stress from the tilted otoconia must be equal to the restoring shear stress from the deformed sensory-epithelial complex.\n$$\\tau_{applied} = \\tau_{restore}$$\nSubstituting the expressions we have derived:\n$$\\tau(\\theta) = K_s \\delta(\\theta)$$\n$$n \\rho V g \\sin(\\theta) = K_s \\delta(\\theta)$$\nSolving for the steady deflection $\\delta(\\theta)$, we find:\n$$\\delta(\\theta) = \\frac{n \\rho V g \\sin(\\theta)}{K_s}$$\nThis expression gives the symbolic relationship for the deflection as a function of head tilt angle $\\theta$ and the physical parameters of the system.\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be only the numerical value from Task 1.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.65 \\times 10^{-11}}$$", "id": "4948574"}, {"introduction": "Once a stimulus is transduced by hair cells, the information must be encoded into patterns of action potentials in vestibular afferent neurons for transmission to the brain.

The coefficient of variability, denoted as $CV$, is a standardized, dimensionless measure of the dispersion of a probability distribution or frequency distribution. It is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation, $\\sigma$, to the mean, $\\mu$.\n\nThe formula for the coefficient of variability is:\n$$\nCV = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}\n$$\nThis measure is dimensionless because the units of the standard deviation and the mean are identical, and thus they cancel out in the ratio. This aligns with the problem's requirement for a \"dimensionless measure\". We will apply this formula to both the regular and irregular afferents.\n\n**1.
