Consider a germline DMR during oocyte growth where de novo DNA methylation is catalyzed by De novo DNA Methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes, and demethylation is negligible over the relevant time scale. Assume a very large population of equivalent cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites within the DMR that are initially unmethylated and behave independently.

The population of CpG sites is very large and all sites are equivalent.\n    2. Sites behave independently.\n    3. Demethylation (the reverse reaction) is negligible.\n- **Objective:** Derive a closed-form analytic expression for $M(t)$, the fraction of CpG sites that are methylated, as a function of $k$ and $t$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem describes a simplified but mechanistically valid model of enzymatic kinetics applied to DNA methylation. The assumption of an irreversible first-order reaction is a standard and appropriate model for many biological processes where the substrate concentration (unmethylated sites) is the limiting factor and enzyme activity is constant. This is a classical problem in chemical kinetics and biophysics. The model is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear initial condition ($M(0)=0$) and defines the rate of change through a constant hazard, which allows for the formulation and solution of a differential equation. The information is sufficient to find a unique solution.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms without subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains no contradictions, missing information, or logical flaws. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. We may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe process described is an irreversible first-order reaction:\n$$\n\\text{Unmethylated Site} \\xrightarrow{k} \\text{Methylated Site}\n$$\nLet $U(t)$ be the fraction of CpG sites that are unmethylated at time $t$, and let $M(t)$ be the fraction of sites that are methylated at time $t$. Since each site can only be in one of these two states, the sum of the fractions must be unity:\n$$\nU(t) + M(t) = 1\n$$\nThe problem states that the methylation process has a constant hazard $k$. This means that the rate of decrease of the unmethylated fraction is directly proportional to the currently available unmethylated fraction. This relationship can be expressed as a first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dU(t)}{dt} = -k \\cdot U(t)\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the fraction of unmethylated sites decreases over time.\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we use the method of separation of variables.\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{U} = -k \\, dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides of the equation. The integration on the left side is from the initial fraction of unmethylated sites, $U(0)$, to the fraction at time $t$, $U(t)$. The integration on the right side is from the initial time, $t=0$, to time $t$.\n$$\n\\int_{U(0)}^{U(t)} \\frac{1}{U'} dU' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, dt'\n$$\nThe problem states that initially all sites are unmethylated. Therefore, the initial condition is $U(0) = 1$. Substituting this into the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{1}^{U(t)} \\frac{1}{U'} dU' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, dt'\n$$\nEvaluating the integrals gives:\n$$\n[\\ln(U')]_{1}^{U(t)} = [-kt']_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(U(t)) - \\ln(1) = -kt - (-k \\cdot 0)\n$$\nSince $\\ln(1) = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\ln(U(t)) = -kt\n$$\nTo find $U(t)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\nU(t) = \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThis expression gives the fraction of CpG sites that remain unmethylated at time $t$. The problem, however, asks for the fraction of sites that are methylated, $M(t)$. Using the conservation relationship $U(t) + M(t) = 1$, we can solve for $M(t)$:\n$$\nM(t) = 1 - U(t)\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $U(t)$:\n$$\nM(t) = 1 - \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the fraction of methylated CpG sites as a function of the rate constant $k$ and time $t$.\nA check of the boundary conditions confirms the validity of the result. At $t=0$, $M(0) = 1 - \\exp(0) = 1 - 1 = 0$, which correctly reflects the initial state of no methylation. As $t \\to \\infty$, $M(t) \\to 1 - 0 = 1$, which correctly reflects that all sites will eventually become methylated in this irreversible process.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1 - \\exp(-kt)}\n$$", "id": "4894465"}, {"introduction": "Once an imprint is established, it must be \"read\" by the cellular machinery to regulate gene expression.

The scenario described is a classic example of genomic imprinting and its inheritance, making it a valid problem in genetics and probability theory.\n\nThis problem requires the use of Bayesian inference to update our belief about the father's genetic status based on the phenotypes of his first two children.
