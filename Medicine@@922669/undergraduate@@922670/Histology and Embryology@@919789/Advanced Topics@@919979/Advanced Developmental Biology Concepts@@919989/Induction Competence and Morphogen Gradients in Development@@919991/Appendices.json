A complete solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe solution is derived in two main steps as requested by the problem. First, we will derive the steady-state fraction of occupied receptors, $R^{*}(L)$. Second, we will use this result to find the activation level, $A(L)$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Steady-State Fraction of Occupied Receptors, $R^{*}(L)$**\n\nThe reversible binding of the ligand $L$ to the free receptor $R$ to form the complex $RL$ is described by the reaction:\n$$ L + R \\underset{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{\\stackrel{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} RL $$\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rate of change of the number of ligand-receptor complexes, $RL$, is given by the difference between the rate of association and the rate of dissociation:\n$$ \\frac{d(RL)}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} L R - k_{\\mathrm{off}} RL $$\nThe problem states that the system is in a quasi-steady state, which implies that the net rate of change of the complex is zero, i.e., $\\frac{d(RL)}{dt} = 0$.\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{on}} L R - k_{\\mathrm{off}} RL = 0 $$\nThis leads to the steady-state condition:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{on}} L R = k_{\\mathrm{off}} RL $$\nThe problem asks to define the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_{d}$, from the kinetic parameters. $K_{d}$ is defined as the ratio of the dissociation rate constant to the association rate constant:\n$$ K_{d} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}} $$\nSubstituting this definition into the steady-state condition ($L R = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}} RL$) gives:\n$$ L R = K_{d} RL $$\nThe second piece of information is the conservation of the total number of receptors, $R_{\\mathrm{T}}$. The total receptors are partitioned into free receptors, $R$, and bound receptors, $RL$:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{T}} = R + RL $$\nWe want to find an expression for the fraction of occupied receptors, $R^{*}(L) = \\frac{RL}{R_{\\mathrm{T}}}$. To do this, we solve the system of two equations for $RL$. From the conservation equation, we express the number of free receptors, $R$, in terms of $R_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and $RL$:\n$$ R = R_{\\mathrm{T}} - RL $$\nNow, substitute this expression for $R$ into the steady-state equation ($L R = K_{d} RL$):\n$$ L(R_{\\mathrm{T}} - RL) = K_{d} RL $$\nExpand the left side:\n$$ L R_{\\mathrm{T}} - L RL = K_{d} RL $$\nRearrange the equation to solve for $RL$:\n$$ L R_{\\mathrm{T}} = K_{d} RL + L RL $$\n$$ L R_{\\mathrm{T}} = (K_{d} + L) RL $$\nIsolating $RL$ yields:\n$$ RL = \\frac{L R_{\\mathrm{T}}}{K_{d} + L} $$\nThe fraction of occupied receptors, $R^{*}(L)$, is obtained by dividing $RL$ by the total number of receptors, $R_{\\mathrm{T}}$:\n$$ R^{*}(L) = \\frac{RL}{R_{\\mathrm{T}}} = \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{T}}} \\left( \\frac{L R_{\\mathrm{T}}}{K_{d} + L} \\right) $$\n$$ R^{*}(L) = \\frac{L}{K_{d} + L} $$\nThis expression, known as the Hill-Langmuir equation, gives the steady-state fraction of bound receptors as a function of ligand concentration $L$ and the dissociation constant $K_{d}$.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Activation Level, $A(L)$**\n\nThe problem states that the downstream signaling activation level, $A(L)$, is linearly proportional to the receptor occupancy, $R^{*}(L)$. The coefficient of proportionality is given as $\\beta$.\n$$ A(L) = \\beta \\cdot R^{*}(L) $$\nWe can now substitute the expression for $R^{*}(L)$ derived in Part 1 into this equation:\n$$ A(L) = \\beta \\left( \\frac{L}{K_{d} + L} \\right) $$\nThis simplifies to the final closed-form analytic expression for $A(L)$ in terms of $L$, $K_{d}$, and $\\beta$:\n$$ A(L) = \\frac{\\beta L}{K_{d} + L} $$\nThis expression represents the activation level of the cell as a hyperbolic function of the local morphogen concentration, a fundamental relationship in understanding how morphogen gradients are interpreted by cells to determine their developmental fate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\beta L}{K_{d} + L}}$$", "id": "4906314"}, {"introduction": "Sensing a morphogen is not enough; a cell must translate that signal into a decisive action, like activating a specific gene.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\nThe total concentration of promoters, $[P_{total}]$, is the sum of the concentrations of the unbound state $[P]$ and the active, fully bound state $[P^{*}]$.\n$$[P_{total}] = [P] + [P^{*}]$$\nThe assumption of strong positive cooperativity allows us to neglect all intermediate states where fewer than $n$ morphogen molecules are bound.\n\nThe fraction of promoters in the active state, $f(c)$, is defined as the ratio of the concentration of active promoters to the total promoter concentration:\n$$f(c) = \\frac{[P^{*}]}{[P_{total}]} = \\frac{[P^{*}]}{[P] + [P^{*}]}$$\nThe concerted binding reaction at equilibrium is given by:\n$$P + n c \\rightleftharpoons P^{*}$$\nThe law of mass action applied to the dissociation of the active complex $P^{*}$ gives the overall dissociation constant, $K_D$:\n$$K_D = \\frac{[P][c]^n}{[P^{*}]}$$\nThe problem states that $K$ is the \"per-ligand dissociation constant\". In the context of a concerted, highly cooperative Hill model, this parameter $K$ is conventionally used as the half-saturation concentration. The form of the Hill equation is $f(c) = \\frac{c^n}{K_{half}^n + c^n}$. For this formulation to be dimensionally consistent, the term $K_{half}^n$ must have the same dimensions as $c^n$. Given that $K$ has units of concentration, we identify the half-saturation constant $K_{half}$ with the given parameter $K$. This implies that the overall dissociation constant $K_D$ is equal to $K^n$.\nTherefore, we set $K_D = K^n$.\n$$K^n = \\frac{[P][c]^n}{[P^{*}]}$$\nFrom this equilibrium relationship, we can express the concentration of unbound promoters, $[P]$, in terms of the concentration of active promoters, $[P^{*}]$, and the morphogen concentration, $c$:\n$$[P] = K^n \\frac{[P^{*}]}{c^n}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[P]$ into the equation for the fraction $f(c)$:\n$$f(c) = \\frac{[P^{*}]}{K^n \\frac{[P^{*}]}{c^n} + [P^{*}]}$$\nWe can cancel the term $[P^{*}]$ from the numerator and the denominator, as it is non-zero for $c > 0$:\n$$f(c) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K^n}{c^n} + 1}$$\nTo simplify the expression, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $c^n$:\n$$f(c) = \\frac{c^n}{K^n + c^n}$$\nThis is the first part of the problem, the expression for the equilibrium fraction of active promoters. This is the well-known Hill equation with a Hill coefficient of $n$.\n\nNext, we must find the half-maximal activation threshold concentration, $T$. This is defined as the concentration $c$ at which the induction level is halfway between its basal and maximal values. The induction is proportional to $f(c)$.\nThe basal level corresponds to $c=0$, giving $f(0) = \\frac{0^n}{K^n + 0^n} = 0$.\nThe maximal level corresponds to a saturating concentration of morphogen, $c \\to \\infty$:\n$$\\lim_{c \\to \\infty} f(c) = \\lim_{c \\to \\infty} \\frac{c^n}{K^n + c^n} = \\lim_{c \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{\\frac{K^n}{c^n} + 1} = \\frac{1}{0 + 1} = 1$$\nThe induction level ranges from a value proportional to $0$ to a value proportional to $1$. The half-maximal value is therefore at $f(c) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nWe set $c=T$ and $f(T) = \\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$\\frac{T^n}{K^n + T^n} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nWe solve this equation for $T$:\n$$2 T^n = K^n + T^n$$\n$$2 T^n - T^n = K^n$$\n$$T^n = K^n$$\nSince concentrations $T$ and $K$ must be positive real numbers, we can take the $n$-th root of both sides:\n$$T = K$$\nThe half-maximal activation threshold concentration $T$ is equal to the dissociation constant $K$.

A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe task is to derive the boundary sharpness width, $\\Delta x$, for both a linear and a sigmoidal decoder of an exponential morphogen gradient, and then to compute their ratio. The boundary width $\\Delta x$ is defined as the distance over which the response $R$ drops from $0.9$ to $0.1$. This can be written as $\\Delta x = x_{0.1} - x_{0.9}$, where $R(x_{0.1}) = 0.1$ and $R(x_{0.9}) = 0.9$. Since the morphogen concentration $c(x)$ is a decreasing function of $x$, the response $R(c(x))$ will also be a decreasing function of $x$, ensuring $x_{0.1} > x_{0.9}$.\n\n**1. Derivation for the Linear Decoder ($\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{linear}}$)**\n\nThe linear response function is $R_{\\mathrm{L}}(c) = c/c_s$.
