It is scientifically grounded in the principles of renal histopathology, well-posed with all necessary information provided for a unique solution, and objective in its language. The data and definitions are consistent with established medical practice.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the crescent fraction, denoted by $c$, in a renal biopsy sample. The foundational principles are based on the quantitative analysis of histopathological findings to grade disease severity.\n\nThe givens are:\n1.  The total number of non-sclerotic glomeruli available for evaluation is $n=20$.\n2.  The number of glomeruli that exhibit cellular crescents is $k=8$.\n3.  The formula for the crescent fraction is explicitly defined as $c = \\frac{k}{n}$.\n\nThe task is to compute the value of $c$. We substitute the given numerical values into the provided formula:\n$$c = \\frac{k}{n} = \\frac{8}{20}$$\nThis fraction must be simplified to its lowest terms. The greatest common divisor of the numerator, $8$, and the denominator, $20$, is $4$. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by $4$, we obtain:\n$$c = \\frac{8 \\div 4}{20 \\div 4} = \\frac{2}{5}$$\nThus, the crescent fraction is $\\frac{2}{5}$.\n\nThe problem further instructs to use the provided criterion to categorize the disease and explain the implications. The criterion states that crescentic disease is diffuse if $c \\ge 0.5$ and focal if $c < 0.5$. To apply this criterion, we can express our calculated fraction $c$ in decimal form:\n$$c = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4$$\nComparing this value to the threshold of $0.5$:\n$$0.4 < 0.5$$\nAccording to the given definition, this finding corresponds to a **focal** crescentic glomerulonephritis.\n\nThe histopathological implications of this finding are significant. The formation of a crescent is the histological hallmark of severe, acute glomerular injury, characterized by a break in the glomerular capillary wall and proliferation of parietal epithelial cells. This pathological process obstructs Bowman's space, compromises glomerular filtration, and often leads to the clinical syndrome of Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN). The extent of crescent formation, quantified by the crescent fraction $c$, is a critical prognostic indicator. A higher fraction correlates directly with a greater likelihood of rapid and irreversible loss of renal function. In this case, a crescent fraction of $c = 0.4$, or $40\\%$, indicates that a substantial portion of the glomeruli are severely damaged. While categorized as \"focal\" because it is less than the $50\\%$ threshold, a $40\\%$ burden of crescents is a very serious finding. It signifies an aggressive disease process that, without prompt and aggressive immunosuppressive therapy, carries a high risk of progression to glomerulosclerosis, permanent nephron loss, and end-stage renal disease. The \"focal\" classification distinguishes it from the even more dire prognosis of \"diffuse\" disease ($c \\ge 0.5$), but it does not diminish the clinical urgency of the condition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$$", "id": "4901467"}, {"introduction": "In contrast to active lesions like crescents, global glomerulosclerosis represents the final, irreversible endpoint of glomerular injury. Accurately assessing the burden of sclerosis provides a quantitative measure of chronic, established damage and is essential for determining long-term prognosis and the potential for renal functional recovery.

The terminology (glomerulosclerosis, cellular crescents, evaluable glomeruli) and the quantitative approach are standard in the field. The provided numerical values are realistic for a biopsy specimen. The definitions are accurate.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. The calculation of $S_{g}$ is explicitly defined by the provided formula for a proportion and the specified variables ($N_{g}$, $N_{t}$). All necessary data for this calculation are given. The second part of the question, the conceptual explanation, requires reasoning from fundamental principles, which is a valid and well-defined intellectual task.\n- **Objective:** The language is clinical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous claims.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. The data provided are sufficient for the requested calculation. The presence of additional data ($N_{s}$ and $N_{c}$) that are not used in the primary calculation tests the ability to follow instructions precisely, rather than indicating an inconsistency. The sum of the specified lesions ($N_{g} + N_{s} + N_{c} = 9 + 6 + 3 = 18$) is less than the total number of glomeruli ($N_{t} = 30$), which is expected, as some glomeruli may be normal or have other unspecified findings.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Part 1: Calculation of the Global Sclerosis Fraction ($S_{g}$)\nThe problem defines a proportion as the ratio of the count of events of interest to the total count of evaluable units. For the calculation of the global sclerosis fraction, $S_{g}$, the \"event of interest\" is the finding of a globally sclerosed glomerulus, and the \"total count of evaluable units\" is the total number of evaluable glomeruli in the biopsy.\n\nThe count of events of interest is given as $N_{g} = 9$.\nThe total count of evaluable units is given as $N_{t} = 30$.\n\nFollowing the provided definition, the global sclerosis fraction $S_{g}$ is formulated as:\n$$S_{g} = \\frac{\\text{Number of globally sclerosed glomeruli}}{\\text{Total number of evaluable glomeruli}}$$\nSymbolically, this is:\n$$S_{g} = \\frac{N_{g}}{N_{t}}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$S_{g} = \\frac{9}{30}$$\nThe problem requires this fraction to be simplified. The greatest common divisor of the numerator, $9$, and the denominator, $30$, is $3$. Dividing both by $3$ yields:\n$$S_{g} = \\frac{9 \\div 3}{30 \\div 3} = \\frac{3}{10}$$\nThis is the simplified fraction for the global sclerosis fraction.\n\n### Part 2: Mechanistic Prognostic Significance of $S_{g}$\nThe magnitude of the global sclerosis fraction, $S_{g}$, informs prognosis by providing a direct, quantitative measure of irreversible parenchymal damage. This can be understood through its direct relationship to nephron loss, its role as a marker of chronicity, and its implications for therapeutic responsiveness.\n\n- **Nephron Loss:** The fundamental functional unit of the kidney is the nephron, for which the glomerulus serves as the filtration apparatus. The problem defines global glomerulosclerosis as the \"complete obsolescence of the glomerular tuft with collagenous replacement.\" This describes an end-stage, non-functional scar. Therefore, each globally sclerosed glomerulus represents one lost, non-functional nephron. The fraction $S_{g}$ is thus a direct estimate of the proportion of total nephrons that have been permanently destroyed. A value of $S_{g} = \\frac{3}{10}$ implies that approximately $30\\%$ of the nephrons in the sampled cortical tissue are irreversibly lost. A higher $S_{g}$ signifies a greater reduction in the kidney's overall filtration capacity, which correlates directly with a poorer prognosis for renal function.\n\n- **Chronicity of Injury:** Pathologic processes in the glomerulus can be active/acute (e.g., cellular inflammation, proliferation, or cellular crescents as given by $N_{c}$) or chronic/scarred (e.g., sclerosis). Sclerosis is the result of a fibrotic healing response to prior, often prolonged or severe, injury. It is a process that takes time to develop. Therefore, $S_{g}$ serves as a robust histopathologic marker of the chronicity of the underlying disease. A high $S_{g}$ indicates that the injurious process has been active for a substantial duration, leading to the accumulation of irreversible damage. It distinguishes chronic, indolent processes or late-stage presentations of aggressive diseases from acute, recent-onset diseases where sclerosis has not yet had time to develop.\n\n- **Responsiveness to Immunosuppressive Therapy:** Immunosuppressive therapies, which are the mainstay of treatment for many forms of glomerulonephritis, are designed to target active immunological and inflammatory processes. Such therapies can potentially arrest further damage and may even allow for the resolution of active lesions (e.g., converting a cellular crescent into a fibrous scar or allowing an inflamed glomerulus to heal). However, these therapies have no capacity to reverse established fibrosis. A globally sclerosed glomerulus is an acellular, avascular scar that is biologically inert and completely refractory to any known anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive treatment. Therefore, the magnitude of $S_{g}$ represents the fraction of the renal parenchyma that cannot, under any circumstances, be salvaged by therapy. A high $S_{g}$ implies that even with successful treatment of the active disease component, the patient's baseline renal function will remain permanently impaired due to the extensive pre-existing scar tissue. This limits the potential for functional recovery and signifies a poorer long-term prognosis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}$$", "id": "4901520"}, {"introduction": "A definitive diagnosis in glomerulonephritis rarely relies on a single finding; instead, it requires the skillful integration of data from multiple modalities.

It is a well-structured question that requires the application of both quantitative analysis and pattern recognition based on established principles of pathology. Therefore, I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Semi-Quantitative IF Scores**\n\nUsing the provided definition of the mean score for an ordinal scale, we calculate the score for each marker. The total number of glomeruli is $n = 20$. The intensity grades are represented by the numbers $0$, $1$, $2$, and $3$.\n\n- **IgG Score**:\n$$ \\text{Score}_{\\text{IgG}} = \\frac{(3 \\times 2) + (2 \\times 8) + (1 \\times 6) + (0 \\times 4)}{20} = \\frac{6 + 16 + 6 + 0}{20} = \\frac{28}{20} = 1.4 $$\n\n- **IgA Score**:\n$$ \\text{Score}_{\\text{IgA}} = \\frac{(3 \\times 1) + (2 \\times 3) + (1 \\times 6) + (0 \\times 10)}{20} = \\frac{3 + 6 + 6 + 0}{20} = \\frac{15}{20} = 0.75 $$\n\n- **IgM Score**:\n$$ \\text{Score}_{\\text{IgM}} = \\frac{(3 \\times 0) + (2 \\times 2) + (1 \\times 8) + (0 \\times 10)}{20} = \\frac{0 + 4 + 8 + 0}{20} = \\frac{12}{20} = 0.6 $$\n\n- **C3 Score**:\n$$ \\text{Score}_{\\text{C3}} = \\frac{(3 \\times 10) + (2 \\times 6) + (1 \\times 2) + (0 \\times 2)}{20} = \\frac{30 + 12 + 2 + 0}{20} = \\frac{44}{20} = 2.2 $$\n\n- **C1q Score**:\n$$ \\text{Score}_{\\text{C1q}} = \\frac{(3 \\times 0) + (2 \\times 1) + (1 \\times 3) + (0 \\times 16)}{20} = \\frac{0 + 2 + 3 + 0}{20} = \\frac{5}{20} = 0.25 $$\n\n**Summary of IF Scores**: C3 ($2.2$), IgG ($1.4$), IgA ($0.75$), IgM ($0.6$), C1q ($0.25$).\nThe IF profile shows C3-dominant deposition, with moderate IgG and minimal-to-absent IgA, IgM, and C1q. The near-absence of C1q with strong C3 suggests complement activation primarily via the alternative pathway. The granular pattern indicates immune complex deposition.\n\n**Part 2: Integrated Pathological Diagnosis**\n\nWe synthesize the findings from all modalities:\n1.  **LM**: \"diffuse endocapillary hypercellularity with abundant neutrophils\". This is a classic picture of a diffuse proliferative and exudative glomerulonephritis, often seen in infectious contexts.\n2.  **IF**: \"coarse granular\" deposits of C3 (strong) and IgG (moderate) in capillary walls and mesangium, with C1q being negligible. This pattern is characteristic of immune complex-mediated GN with alternative pathway activation. The statement \"no linear GBM pattern\" effectively rules out anti-GBM disease.\n3.  **EM**: \"numerous large subepithelial 'hump'-like electron-dense deposits\". This finding is considered pathognomonic for acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN). The absence of \"spikes\" helps to exclude membranous nephropathy.\n\nThe combination of acute nephritic syndrome, diffuse proliferative and exudative GN on LM, C3-dominant granular deposits on IF, and large subepithelial \"humps\" on EM forms the classic diagnostic triad for **acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis**.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n- **A. Membranous nephropathy**: This condition is characterized by subepithelial immune deposits, but on LM, it typically shows thickened basement membranes with little to no cellular proliferation. On EM, it features a characteristic formation of \"spikes\" of new basement membrane around the deposits. The provided LM and EM findings (\"endocapillary hypercellularity\" and \"no uniform subepithelial spikes\") are inconsistent with this diagnosis. **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **B. IgA nephropathy**: The defining feature of this disease is dominant or co-dominant deposition of IgA, primarily in the mesangium. The IF results show a mean IgA score of only $0.75$, which is significantly lower than the C3 score ($2.2$) and IgG score ($1.4$). Therefore, IgA is not the dominant immunoglobulin. **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Post-infectious (post-streptococcal) glomerulonephritis**: This diagnosis perfectly aligns with all the findings:\n    - LM: Diffuse proliferative and exudative GN (endocapillary hypercellularity with neutrophils).\n    - IF: Granular, C3-dominant deposits with IgG.\n    - EM: Large subepithelial \"humps\".\n    This is the classic textbook presentation. **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **D. Lupus nephritis (immune complex-mediated, “full-house” pattern)**: Proliferative lupus nephritis (Class III or IV) can show endocapillary hypercellularity. However, the term \"full-house\" implies significant staining for IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and C1q. The data shows weak staining for IgA and IgM and virtually no C1q staining (mean score $0.25$). This contradicts a \"full-house\" pattern. The lack of C1q is a strong argument against this diagnosis, as classical pathway activation is typical in lupus nephritis. **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **E. Anti–glomerular basement membrane disease (Goodpasture syndrome)**: This disease is caused by autoantibodies against the GBM. Its hallmark is a smooth, continuous, **linear** pattern of IgG deposition along the GBM on IF. The problem explicitly states there is a \"granular\" pattern and \"no linear GBM pattern\". **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4901615"}]}
