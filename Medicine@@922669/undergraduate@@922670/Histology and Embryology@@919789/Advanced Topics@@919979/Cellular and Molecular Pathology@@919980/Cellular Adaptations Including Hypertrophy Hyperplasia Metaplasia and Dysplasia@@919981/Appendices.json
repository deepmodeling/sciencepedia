It poses a question based on fundamental geometric principles applied to a simplified biological model of cellular hypertrophy. The assumptions are clearly stated, and the task is to perform a mathematical derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the surface area to volume ratio for a sphere and the calculation of its change under a specific increase in radius.\n\nFirst, we model the cell as a perfect sphere of radius $r$. The surface area, $A$, and volume, $V$, of a sphere are given by the standard geometric formulas:\n$$A(r) = 4\\pi r^2$$\n$$V(r) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$$\n\nThe surface area to volume ratio, which we will denote as $R_{SA:V}$, is the quotient of the surface area and the volume:\n$$R_{SA:V}(r) = \\frac{A(r)}{V(r)} = \\frac{4\\pi r^2}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3}$$\n\nWe can simplify this expression by canceling common terms. The $4\\pi$ term in the numerator and denominator cancels, and the $r^2$ term in the numerator cancels with two of the powers of $r$ in the denominator, leaving $r$ in the denominator:\n$$R_{SA:V}(r) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{3}r} = \\frac{3}{r}$$\nThis result shows that the surface area to volume ratio for a sphere is inversely proportional to its radius, $r$. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we analyze the effect of hypertrophy. Let the initial radius of the cell be $r_1$. The initial surface area to volume ratio is:\n$$R_1 = \\frac{3}{r_1}$$\n\nThe problem states that the radius increases by $20\\%$. The new radius, $r_2$, is therefore:\n$$r_2 = r_1 + 0.20 \\times r_1 = (1 + 0.20)r_1 = 1.2 r_1$$\nTo work with an exact fraction as requested for the final answer, we express $1.2$ as a fraction:\n$$r_2 = \\frac{12}{10} r_1 = \\frac{6}{5} r_1$$\n\nThe new surface area to volume ratio, $R_2$, corresponding to the new radius $r_2$ is:\n$$R_2 = \\frac{3}{r_2} = \\frac{3}{\\frac{6}{5} r_1}$$\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n$$R_2 = 3 \\times \\frac{5}{6r_1} = \\frac{15}{6r_1} = \\frac{5}{2r_1}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the multiplicative change, which is defined as the new ratio divided by the original ratio, $\\frac{R_2}{R_1}$:\n$$\\frac{R_2}{R_1} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{2r_1}}{\\frac{3}{r_1}}$$\nThe variable $r_1$ cancels out from the numerator and the denominator, yielding a purely numerical result:\n$$\\frac{R_2}{R_1} = \\frac{5/2}{3} = \\frac{5}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{5}{6}$$\n\nThus, when the radius of the spherical cell increases by $20\\%$, the surface area to volume ratio is multiplied by a factor of $\\frac{5}{6}$, which represents a decrease.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{5}{6}}$$", "id": "4872612"}, {"introduction": "In contrast to hypertrophy, hyperplasia involves an increase in the number of cells.
