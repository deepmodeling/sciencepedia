The provided data are consistent and sufficient for calculation. The terminology is precise and objective. The problem requires knowledge of the standard CERAD semi-quantitative thresholds for neuritic plaque density, which are:\n- None: $0$ plaques/$\\text{mm}^2$\n- Sparse: $1-5$ plaques/$\\text{mm}^2$\n- Moderate: $6-19$ plaques/$\\text{mm}^2$\n- Frequent: $\\geq 20$ plaques/$\\text{mm}^2$\nThis is standard information within the specified discipline and does not render the problem incomplete. The problem is well-posed and valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is determined by a three-step process: First, calculate the area of the microscopic field of view. Second, calculate the mean plaque density using the given counts and the calculated area. Third, classify this density using the standard CERAD criteria.\n\nThe diameter of the field of view, $D_{\\text{FOV}}$, is a function of the eyepiece's field number ($FN$) and the objective's magnification ($M_{\\text{obj}}$). The relationship is given by the formula:\n$$D_{\\text{FOV}} = \\frac{FN}{M_{\\text{obj}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values, $FN = 22 \\text{ mm}$ and $M_{\\text{obj}} = 20$:\n$$D_{\\text{FOV}} = \\frac{22 \\text{ mm}}{20} = 1.1 \\text{ mm}$$\nThe area of the circular field of view, $A_{\\text{FOV}}$, is calculated using the formula for the area of a circle, $A = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (D/2)^2$:\n$$A_{\\text{FOV}} = \\pi \\left(\\frac{D_{\\text{FOV}}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{1.1 \\text{ mm}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi (0.55 \\text{ mm})^2 = 0.3025 \\pi \\text{ mm}^2$$\n\nNext, we calculate the mean plaque count per field, $\\bar{C}$. The given counts are $12$, $18$, $25$, $16$, and $20$. The total number of fields is $N=5$.\nThe total number of plaques counted is:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{5} C_i = 12 + 18 + 25 + 16 + 20 = 91$$\nThe mean count per field is:\n$$\\bar{C} = \\frac{\\sum C_i}{N} = \\frac{91}{5} = 18.2$$\n\nThe mean neuritic plaque density, $\\rho$, is the mean plaque count per field divided by the area of a single field:\n$$\\rho = \\frac{\\bar{C}}{A_{\\text{FOV}}} = \\frac{18.2}{0.3025 \\pi \\text{ mm}^2}$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value of $\\rho$:\n$$\\rho \\approx \\frac{18.2}{0.3025 \\times 3.14159265...} \\approx \\frac{18.2}{0.95033177...} \\approx 19.1511 \\text{ plaques}/\\text{mm}^2$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\rho \\approx 19.15 \\text{ plaques}/\\text{mm}^2$$\nThis is the first required quantity.\n\nFor the second quantity, we must convert this density to a CERAD neuritic plaque grade. The standard CERAD thresholds are:\n- Sparse (code $1$): $1-5$ plaques/$\\text{mm}^2$\n- Moderate (code $2$): $6-19$ plaques/$\\text{mm}^2$\n- Frequent (code $3$): $\\geq 20$ plaques/$\\text{mm}^2$\nOur calculated density is $\\rho \\approx 19.15$ plaques/$\\text{mm}^2$. This value falls within the range $[6, 19]$. Therefore, the CERAD grade is “moderate.” The corresponding integer code is $2$.\n\nFor the third quantity, we must state the numerical threshold that delineates the lower bound for the “frequent” category. According to the CERAD criteria, the “frequent” category includes densities greater than or equal to $20$ plaques/$\\text{mm}^2$. Thus, the lower bound is $20$ plaques/$\\text{mm}^2$.\n\nThe three requested quantities, in order, are:\n1.  Plaque density: $19.15$ plaques/$\\text{mm}^2$\n2.  CERAD integer code: $2$\n3.
