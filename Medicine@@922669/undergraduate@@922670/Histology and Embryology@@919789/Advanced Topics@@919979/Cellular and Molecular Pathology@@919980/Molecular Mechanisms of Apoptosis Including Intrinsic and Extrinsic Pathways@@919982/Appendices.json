The fold change is the ratio of the free caspase-3 concentration with SMAC present to the baseline free caspase-3 concentration without SMAC. We assume caspase-3 activity is directly proportional to its free concentration.\n\nThe analysis is based on competitive binding equilibria under the free-ligand approximation, which states that the concentration of free ligand is approximately equal to its total concentration because the total receptor concentration is much smaller. Here, $X_T \\ll S_T$ and $X_T \\ll C_T$.\n\nLet $[X]$, $[S]$, and $[C]$ be the concentrations of free XIAP, free SMAC, and free caspase-3, respectively. Let $[XS]$ and $[XC]$ be the concentrations of the XIAP-SMAC and XIAP-caspase-3 complexes.\n\n**1. Baseline State: No SMAC present ($S_T = 0$)**\n\nIn the baseline state, only the interaction between XIAP ($X$) and caspase-3 ($C$) occurs:\n$$X + C \\rightleftharpoons XC$$\nThe dissociation constant is $K_{d,C} = \\frac{[X][C]}{[XC]}$.\nThe fraction of XIAP bound to caspase-3, $\\theta_{C,baseline}$, is given by the standard binding isotherm:\n$$\\theta_{C,baseline} = \\frac{[C]}{K_{d,C} + [C]}$$\nUsing the free-ligand approximation, we set $[C] \\approx C_T$:\n$$\\theta_{C,baseline} \\approx \\frac{C_T}{K_{d,C} + C_T}$$\nThe concentration of the XIAP-caspase-3 complex, $[XC]_{baseline}$, is the total XIAP concentration multiplied by this fraction:\n$$[XC]_{baseline} = X_T \\cdot \\theta_{C,baseline} \\approx X_T \\frac{C_T}{K_{d,C} + C_T}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$[XC]_{baseline} = (50 \\text{ nM}) \\frac{300 \\text{ nM}}{30 \\text{ nM} + 300 \\text{ nM}} = 50 \\cdot \\frac{300}{330} \\text{ nM} = 50 \\cdot \\frac{10}{11} \\text{ nM} = \\frac{500}{11} \\text{ nM}$$\nThe concentration of free caspase-3 in the baseline state, $[C]_{free,baseline}$, is the total caspase-3 concentration minus the concentration of bound caspase-3:\n$$[C]_{free,baseline} = C_T - [XC]_{baseline} = 300 \\text{ nM} - \\frac{500}{11} \\text{ nM} = \\frac{3300 - 500}{11} \\text{ nM} = \\frac{2800}{11} \\text{ nM}$$\n\n**2.

The two equilibria are:\n$$X + C \\rightleftharpoons XC \\quad (K_{d,C})$$\n$$X + S \\rightleftharpoons XS \\quad (K_{d,S})$$\nThe mass balance for XIAP is $X_T = [X] + [XC] + [XS]$.\nThe fraction of XIAP bound by caspase-3, $\\theta_{C,with\\_SMAC}$, in a competitive system is:\n$$\\theta_{C,with\\_SMAC} = \\frac{\\frac{[C]}{K_{d,C}}}{1 + \\frac{[C]}{K_{d,C}} + \\frac{[S]}{K_{d,S}}}$$\nAgain, we apply the free-ligand approximation, setting $[C] \\approx C_T$ and $[S] \\approx S_T$:\n$$\\theta_{C,with\\_SMAC} \\approx \\frac{\\frac{C_T}{K_{d,C}}}{1 + \\frac{C_T}{K_{d,C}} + \\frac{S_T}{K_{d,S}}}$$\nLet's compute the dimensionless ratios:\n$$\\frac{C_T}{K_{d,C}} = \\frac{300 \\text{ nM}}{30 \\text{ nM}} = 10$$\n$$\\frac{S_T}{K_{d,S}} = \\frac{500 \\text{ nM}}{100 \\text{ nM}} = 5$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\theta_{C,with\\_SMAC}$:\n$$\\theta_{C,with\\_SMAC} = \\frac{10}{1 + 10 + 5} = \\frac{10}{16} = \\frac{5}{8}$$\nThe concentration of the XIAP-caspase-3 complex is:\n$$[XC]_{with\\_SMAC} = X_T \\cdot \\theta_{C,with\\_SMAC} = 50 \\text{ nM} \\cdot \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{250}{8} \\text{ nM} = 31.25 \\text{ nM}$$\nThe concentration of free caspase-3 with SMAC present is:\n$$[C]_{free,with\\_SMAC} = C_T - [XC]_{with\\_SMAC} = 300 \\text{ nM} - 31.25 \\text{ nM} = 268.75 \\text{ nM}$$\n\nThe problem also asks for the fraction of XIAP bound by SMAC:\n$$\\theta_{S,with\\_SMAC} = \\frac{\\frac{S_T}{K_{d,S}}}{1 + \\frac{C_T}{K_{d,C}} + \\frac{S_T}{K_{d,S}}} = \\frac{5}{1 + 10 + 5} = \\frac{5}{16} = 0.3125$$\n\n**3. Fold Change in Free Caspase-3 Activity**\n\nThe fold change is the ratio of free caspase-3 with SMAC to that without SMAC:\n$$\\text{Fold Change} = \\frac{[C]_{free,with\\_SMAC}}{[C]_{free,baseline}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\\text{Fold Change} = \\frac{268.75 \\text{ nM}}{\\frac{2800}{11} \\text{ nM}} = \\frac{268.75 \\times 11}{2800}$$\nWe can write $268.75$ as $\\frac{1075}{4}$.\n$$\\text{Fold Change} = \\frac{1075}{4} \\cdot \\frac{11}{2800} = \\frac{11825}{11200} \\approx 1.05580357...$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures gives $1.056$.\nThe introduction of SMAC leads to a displacement of caspase-3 from XIAP, increasing the concentration of free, active caspase-3 by a factor of approximately $1.056$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.056}$$", "id": "4916172"}, {"introduction": "Textbook diagrams often depict signaling pathways as simple, linear chains, but reality is far more complex and dynamic.

In single living cells, the timing of caspase activation can be measured using Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based biosensors. Consider the following time-resolved single-cell measurements under a uniform Fas ligand stimulus in an epithelial line.

The extrinsic pathway, the roles of caspase-8 and -3, the distinction between Type I (direct) and Type II (mitochondrial) pathways, the function of Bcl-2 family proteins, and the process of MOMP are all textbook cell biology. The use of FRET biosensors for single-cell kinetic analysis is a standard, modern technique in the field. The provided data values (times in minutes, statistical distributions) are biologically plausible. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for the most likely inference to be drawn from a specific set of experimental data, given a theoretical framework. There is sufficient information to evaluate the competing hypotheses presented in the options.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms. It is free from subjective language or opinion.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. It provides the necessary definitions (Type I vs. Type II, $t_8$, $t_3$, $\\tau_3$) and all the data required to reason about the underlying pathway. The data are internally consistent (e.g., a highly variable delay is consistent with a high coefficient of variation).\n5.  **Flaw Check**: The problem does not violate any of the specified flaw criteria. It is not unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, or ill-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is internally consistent, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. I will proceed with a full derivation and analysis.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe central task is to discern whether the extrinsic apoptosis pathway in these cells is primarily Type I (direct) or Type II (mitochondrial amplification), based on the provided temporal dynamics.\n\n**Analysis of Control Condition Data:**\n\n1.  **Causality**: In $n_A = 117$ out of $n = 120$ cells ($97.5\\%$), caspase-8 activation precedes caspase-3 activation ($t_8 < t_3$). This overwhelming statistical evidence supports the canonical model where caspase-8 is an initiator caspase acting upstream of the executioner caspase-3.\n\n2.  **Delay Characteristics ($\\Delta t = t_3 - t_8$)**:\n    - A direct, one-step enzymatic activation (Type I pathway) would be expected to result in a short, relatively uniform delay between $t_8$ and $t_3$.\n    - The observed median delay is $\\tilde{m} = 28$ minutes, which is substantial. The distribution is highly heterogeneous, as evidenced by a large interquartile range of $51 - 15 = 36$ minutes and a high coefficient of variation ($CV \\approx 0.7$). A $CV > 0.5$ is often indicative of a complex, multi-step, or stochastic process. The long tail of the distribution, with $10\\%$ of cells taking over an hour, further supports this.\n    - This long and variable delay is the classic signature of a signaling pathway that involves a stochastic, threshold-gated switch. The Type II pathway, which requires the accumulation of tBid to a critical concentration to trigger the all-or-none event of MOMP, fits this description perfectly. The time $\\Delta t$ would represent the time required to trigger and complete MOMP and subsequent apoptosome formation.\n\n3.  **Execution Speed ($\\tau_3$)**:\n    - $\\tau_3$ measures the speed of the execution phase *after* caspase-3 has been initially activated. This phase involves feedback loops that rapidly amplify caspase-3 activity.\n    - The mean time is $\\mu_{\\tau} = 8$ minutes, with a standard deviation of $\\sigma_{\\tau} = 2$ minutes. The coefficient of variation for this phase is $CV_{\\tau} = \\sigma_{\\tau} / \\mu_{\\tau} = 2/8 = 0.25$.\n    - In contrast to the delay $\\Delta t$, the execution phase is fast and exhibits low cell-to-cell variability ($CV_{\\tau} < CV_{\\Delta t}$). This kinetic signature—a long, variable \"decision\" phase ($\\Delta t$) followed by a rapid, deterministic \"execution\" phase ($\\tau_3$)—is a hallmark of systems controlled by an irreversible, digital-like switch.\n\n**Analysis of Perturbation Data:**\n\nThe experiment with Bcl-2 overexpression provides causal evidence.\n\n1.  **Mechanism of Bcl-2**: Bcl-2 is a canonical anti-apoptotic protein that functions at the outer mitochondrial membrane to inhibit MOMP, for example by sequestering pro-apoptotic proteins like tBid, Bak, or Bax.\n2.  **Effect of Bcl-2 Overexpression**:\n    - The distribution of $t_8$ is unchanged. This is a critical control, demonstrating that the perturbation does not affect the upstream signaling events (receptor ligation, DISC formation, caspase-8 activation). The intervention is specific to the mitochondrial branch of the pathway.\n    - The signal from caspase-8 to caspase-3 is severely impaired: $65\\%$ of cells fail to activate caspase-3, and in those that do, the delay $\\Delta t$ is dramatically increased (median $> 60$ minutes).\n3.  **Conclusion from Perturbation**: Since Bcl-2 specifically inhibits the mitochondrial pathway, and its overexpression specifically blocks or delays the activation of caspase-3 downstream of caspase-8, it confirms that the mitochondrial pathway is not just present but *necessary* for efficient caspase-3 activation in this system.\n\n**Synthesis:**\nThe control data shows a kinetic signature (long, variable delay followed by rapid, uniform execution) characteristic of a Type II pathway. The perturbation data provides direct causal evidence, confirming that inhibiting the mitochondrial step blocks signal transmission from caspase-8 to caspase-3. Therefore, the cells utilize a mitochondrial amplification loop (Type II pathway).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Mitochondrial amplification occurred in the Control condition; the long, heterogeneous delays between $t_8$ and $t_3$, coupled with fast, low-variance $\\tau_3$ and the selective suppression of $t_3$ (but not $t_8$) by Bcl-2, indicate a thresholded mitochondrial step upstream of caspase-3.**\nThis statement correctly synthesizes all pieces of evidence. It correctly interprets the long, variable delay ($\\Delta t$) and the fast, uniform execution ($\\tau_3$) as the signature of a thresholded process. It also correctly interprets the Bcl-2 perturbation experiment as direct evidence for a mitochondrial step that is downstream of caspase-8 and upstream of caspase-3. This option is fully supported by the data and established principles.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Mitochondrial amplification is absent in the Control condition; because $t_8$ precedes $t_3$ in most cells, caspase-8 must directly activate caspase-3 with no amplification.**\nThis statement makes a logical error. The fact that $t_8 < t_3$ only establishes the direction of causality; it provides no information about the presence or absence of intermediate amplification steps. A Type II pathway also has $t_8 < t_3$. This option completely ignores the most informative data: the long and variable nature of the delay $\\Delta t$ and, most critically, the results of the Bcl-2 perturbation experiment, which directly contradict the claim that amplification is absent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The observed delays primarily reflect slower kinetics of the caspase-3 FRET reporter, not pathway architecture; therefore mitochondrial involvement cannot be inferred.**\nThis option proposes a measurement artifact as an explanation. This is unlikely for several reasons. Firstly, a slow reporter would likely introduce a more constant, not highly variable, delay. It cannot explain the high $CV \\approx 0.7$ of $\\Delta t$. Secondly, and decisively, this hypothesis is falsified by the Bcl-2 perturbation data. There is no plausible mechanism by which overexpression of a mitochondrial protein (Bcl-2) would alter the cleavage kinetics of a cytosolic FRET reporter by caspase-3. The fact that Bcl-2 strongly affects $\\Delta t$ proves that the delay is a feature of the biological pathway, not the reporter.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The reversals in $n_B = 3$ cells demonstrate feedback from caspase-3 to caspase-8 is dominant, ruling out a role for mitochondria in shaping the delay distribution.**\nThis statement draws a conclusion that is both statistically and logically unsound. It bases a major claim about the \"dominant\" pathway architecture on a tiny fraction of the data ($n_B = 3$ cells, or $2.5\\%$), while ignoring the overwhelming trend in the other $97.5\\%$ of cells. In single-cell studies, such outliers are common and cannot be used to invalidate a robustly observed trend. Furthermore, the conclusion \"ruling out a role for mitochondria\" is a non-sequitur and is directly contradicted by the Bcl-2 perturbation experiment, which this option fails to consider.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4916138"}, {"introduction": "A cell's decision to die is not always a simple 'yes' or 'no' for apoptosis; multiple programmed death pathways exist and can influence one another.

The threshold activity $R_{\\text{th}}$ is therefore defined by the equality:\n$$\nf(R_{\\text{th}}) = \\phi\n$$\nThe problem provides the expression for $f(R)$:\n$$\nf(R) = \\frac{k_{p} \\, x(R)}{k_{p} \\, x(R) + k_{dp}}\n$$\nwhere $k_{p}$ is the phosphorylation rate constant, $k_{dp}$ is the dephosphorylation rate constant, and $x(R)$ is the fraction of activated RIPK$3$.\n\nSubstituting this expression into the threshold condition gives:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{p} \\, x(R_{\\text{th}})}{k_{p} \\, x(R_{\\text{th}}) + k_{dp}} = \\phi\n$$\nWe must first solve this algebraic equation for $x(R_{\\text{th}})$.\n$$\nk_{p} \\, x(R_{\\text{th}}) = \\phi (k_{p} \\, x(R_{\\text{th}}) + k_{dp})\n$$\n$$\nk_{p} \\, x(R_{\\text{th}}) = \\phi \\, k_{p} \\, x(R_{\\text{th}}) + \\phi \\, k_{dp}\n$$\nRearranging the terms to isolate $x(R_{\\text{th}})$:\n$$\nk_{p} \\, x(R_{\\text{th}}) - \\phi \\, k_{p} \\, x(R_{\\text{th}}) = \\phi \\, k_{dp}\n$$\n$$\nx(R_{\\text{th}}) (k_{p} - \\phi \\, k_{p}) = \\phi \\, k_{dp}\n$$\n$$\nx(R_{\\text{th}}) \\, k_{p} (1 - \\phi) = \\phi \\, k_{dp}\n$$\nSolving for the threshold fraction of activated RIPK$3$, $x(R_{\\text{th}})$:\n$$\nx(R_{\\text{th}}) = \\frac{\\phi \\, k_{dp}}{k_{p} (1 - \\phi)}\n$$\nThe problem states that the fraction of activated RIPK$3$, $x(R)$, is a saturating function of the RIPK$1$ kinase activity, $R$:\n$$\nx(R) = \\frac{R}{K_{R} + R}\n$$\nwhere $K_{R}$ is the half-activation constant.\n\nAt the threshold activity $R_{\\text{th}}$, we can set the two expressions for $x(R_{\\text{th}})$ equal to each other:\n$$\n\\frac{R_{\\text{th}}}{K_{R} + R_{\\text{th}}} = \\frac{\\phi \\, k_{dp}}{k_{p} (1 - \\phi)}\n$$\nTo simplify, let us define a dimensionless constant $A = \\frac{\\phi \\, k_{dp}}{k_{p} (1 - \\phi)}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{R_{\\text{th}}}{K_{R} + R_{\\text{th}}} = A\n$$\nWe now solve this equation for $R_{\\text{th}}$:\n$$\nR_{\\text{th}} = A (K_{R} + R_{\\text{th}})\n$$\n$$\nR_{\\text{th}} = A \\, K_{R} + A \\, R_{\\text{th}}\n$$\n$$\nR_{\\text{th}} - A \\, R_{\\text{th}} = A \\, K_{R}\n$$\n$$\nR_{\\text{th}} (1 - A) = A \\, K_{R}\n$$\n$$\nR_{\\text{th}} = K_{R} \\frac{A}{1 - A}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $A$ back into the equation for $R_{\\text{th}}$:\n$$\nR_{\\text{th}} = K_{R} \\frac{\\frac{\\phi \\, k_{dp}}{k_{p} (1 - \\phi)}}{1 - \\frac{\\phi \\, k_{dp}}{k_{p} (1 - \\phi)}} = K_{R} \\frac{\\frac{\\phi \\, k_{dp}}{k_{p} (1 - \\phi)}}{\\frac{k_{p}(1-\\phi) - \\phi \\, k_{dp}}{k_{p}(1-\\phi)}}\n$$\nSimplifying the complex fraction yields the final symbolic expression for $R_{\\text{th}}$:\n$$\nR_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{K_{R} \\, \\phi \\, k_{dp}}{k_{p}(1 - \\phi) - \\phi \\, k_{dp}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $k_{p} = 0.20 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$, $k_{dp} = 0.050 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$, $K_{R} = 1.50 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$, and $\\phi = 0.60$.\nThe term $1 - \\phi$ is $1 - 0.60 = 0.40$.\n\nLet us calculate the numerator and denominator separately.\nNumerator:\n$$\nK_{R} \\, \\phi \\, k_{dp} = (1.50) \\times (0.60) \\times (0.050) = (0.90) \\times (0.050) = 0.0450\n$$\nDenominator:\n$$\nk_{p}(1 - \\phi) - \\phi \\, k_{dp} = (0.20)(0.40) - (0.60)(0.050) = 0.080 - 0.030 = 0.050\n$$\nFinally, we compute $R_{\\text{th}}$:\n$$\nR_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{0.0450}{0.050} = 0.90\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
