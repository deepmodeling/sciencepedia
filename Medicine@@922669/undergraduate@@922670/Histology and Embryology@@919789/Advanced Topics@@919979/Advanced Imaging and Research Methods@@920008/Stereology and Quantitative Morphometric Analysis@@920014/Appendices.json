The specimen is embedded, and serial paraffin sections of thickness $5\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ are cut.

The sampling is specified to be on isotropic uniform random (IUR) sections with an IUR test system. These premises are consistent with standard stereological methods for quantitative morphometric analysis in histology. The problem is scientifically sound, contains all necessary information for a unique solution, and is unambiguously formulated. Therefore, it is deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe primary objective is to derive an unbiased estimator for the surface area per unit volume, denoted as $S_V$. In stereology, $S_V$ represents the total surface area of a feature of interest contained within a unit of reference volume. For a three-dimensional structure sampled with an isotropic uniform random (IUR) system of test lines, a fundamental relationship connects $S_V$ to the expected number of intersections, $E[I]$, per unit length of test line, $L$. This relationship is:\n$$ S_V = 2 \\frac{E[I]}{E[L]} $$\nThis equation arises from principles of geometric probability, specifically by averaging the number of intersections over all possible orientations of the surface relative to the test lines. For a sufficiently large and representative sample, an unbiased estimator, $\\hat{S}_V$, for $S_V$ can be constructed from the total observed counts:\n$$ \\hat{S}_V = 2 \\frac{I_{total}}{L_{total}} $$\nHere, $I_{total}$ is the total number of observed intersections, and $L_{total}$ is the total length of the test line system applied to the reference volume. From the problem statement, we are given $I_{total} = I = 320$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the total test line length, $L_{total}$, is estimated using a point-counting method. The test system is calibrated such that there is a known constant line length per test point, $l(p)$. The number of test points hitting the reference space, $P$, is counted. The total length of the test line within the reference space is therefore estimated as the product of the number of points falling on that space and the line length associated with each test point:\n$$ L_{total} = P \\cdot l(p) $$\nThis method provides an unbiased estimate of the total length of the sampling probe (lines) applied to the object of interest (reference volume).\n\nSubstituting this expression for $L_{total}$ into the estimator for $S_V$, we obtain the desired formula in terms of the measurable quantities $I$, $P$, and the calibration constant $l(p)$:\n$$ \\hat{S}_V = 2 \\frac{I}{P \\cdot l(p)} $$\nThis is the final form of the unbiased estimator for the surface area per unit volume.\n\nNow, we can compute the numerical value using the provided data:\nThe number of intersections is $I = 320$.\nThe number of points on the reference space is $P = 800$.\nThe line length per point is $l(p) = 20\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived estimator:\n$$ \\hat{S}_V = 2 \\times \\frac{320}{800 \\times 20 \\, \\mu\\text{m}} $$\nFirst, calculate the product in the denominator:\n$$ 800 \\times 20 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 16000 \\, \\mu\\text{m} $$\nNow, substitute this back into the equation:\n$$ \\hat{S}_V = \\frac{2 \\times 320}{16000} \\, \\mu\\text{m}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\hat{S}_V = \\frac{640}{16000} \\, \\mu\\text{m}^{-1} $$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can cancel common factors:\n$$ \\hat{S}_V = \\frac{64}{1600} \\, \\mu\\text{m}^{-1} $$\nDividing both the numerator and the denominator by $64$:\n$$ \\hat{S}_V = \\frac{1}{25} \\, \\mu\\text{m}^{-1} $$\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$$ \\hat{S}_V = 0.04 \\, \\mu\\text{m}^{-1} $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed with $3$ significant figures.
