For the villus, this means the inflow of new cells from the crypts must balance the outflow of old cells due to shedding.\n\nLet $\\Phi_{in}$ be the rate of cells entering the villus (in cells per day) and $\\Phi_{out}$ be the rate of cells leaving the villus (in cells per day). At steady-state:\n$$\n\\Phi_{in} = \\Phi_{out}\n$$\nFirst, we calculate the outflow rate, $\\Phi_{out}$. The villus has a constant population of $N_{villus} = 250$ cells, and the average lifespan of each cell is $T_{lifespan} = 4$ days. To maintain a constant population, the number of cells lost per day must be equal to the total population divided by the average residence time.\n$$\n\\Phi_{out} = \\frac{N_{villus}}{T_{lifespan}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Phi_{out} = \\frac{250 \\text{ cells}}{4 \\text{ days}} = 62.5 \\frac{\\text{cells}}{\\text{day}}\n$$\nNext, we formulate an expression for the inflow rate, $\\Phi_{in}$. This inflow originates from the mitotic activity in the supplying crypts. Let $R$ be the average mitotic activity per crypt, measured in divisions per day per crypt. The total number of crypts supplying the villus is $N_{crypts} = 6$.\n\nThe total number of cell divisions per day across all these crypts is the product of the rate per crypt and the number of crypts:\n$$\n\\text{Total divisions per day} = R \\cdot N_{crypts}\n$$\nAccording to the problem, each completed mitosis displaces one cell. Therefore, the total rate of cells displaced from the crypts is also $R \\cdot N_{crypts}$. However, only a fraction $p = 0.9$ of these cells actually contributes to the villus population. Thus, the inflow rate to the villus is:\n$$\n\\Phi_{in} = p \\cdot R \\cdot N_{crypts}\n$$\nNow, we can apply the steady-state condition by equating $\\Phi_{in}$ and $\\Phi_{out}$:\n$$\np \\cdot R \\cdot N_{crypts} = \\frac{N_{villus}}{T_{lifespan}}\n$$\nWe need to solve for $R$.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. I will proceed with the full solution.\n\nThe derivation begins with the principle of mass conservation for oxygen in a differential control volume of tissue. Consider a thin slab of tissue with a cross-sectional area $A$ and thickness $\\Delta x$, located between positions $x$ and $x + \\Delta x$. At steady state, the rate of accumulation of oxygen is zero. The mass balance requires that the net rate of oxygen diffusion into the volume equals the rate of oxygen consumption within the volume.\n\nLet $J(x)$ be the flux of oxygen at position $x$. The mass balance is:\n$$A J(x) - A J(x + \\Delta x) - (\\alpha p(x)) (A \\Delta x) = 0$$\nHere, $\\alpha p(x)$ represents the volumetric rate of oxygen consumption, which is given as first-order with respect to the local oxygen level $p(x)$. Dividing by the volume $A \\Delta x$ and rearranging gives:\n$$\\frac{J(x + \\Delta x) - J(x)}{\\Delta x} = -\\alpha p(x)$$\nTaking the limit as $\\Delta x \\to 0$, we obtain the differential form of the mass balance:\n$$\\frac{dJ}{dx} = -\\alpha p(x)$$\nFick's first law of diffusion states that the flux is proportional to the negative gradient of the concentration (or partial pressure, in this context):\n$$J(x) = -D \\frac{dp}{dx}$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. Substituting Fick's law into the mass balance equation yields:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(-D \\frac{dp}{dx}\\right) = -\\alpha p(x)$$\nAssuming that the diffusion coefficient $D$ is constant throughout the tissue, we can simplify this to a second-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$D \\frac{d^2p}{dx^2} = \\alpha p(x)$$\nRearranging the terms gives the canonical form:\n$$\\frac{d^2p}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\alpha}{D} p(x) = 0$$\nThis is the steady-state reaction-diffusion equation for the system. Let us define a constant $k^2 = \\frac{\\alpha}{D}$, so the equation becomes $\\frac{d^2p}{dx^2} - k^2 p(x) = 0$. The general solution to this ODE is:\n$$p(x) = C_1 \\exp(kx) + C_2 \\exp(-kx)$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are integration constants determined by the boundary conditions. The problem specifies two boundary conditions:\n1. $p(0) = p_0$\n2. $p(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$\n\nApplying the second boundary condition, we observe that for $k > 0$, the term $\\exp(kx)$ approaches infinity as $x \\to \\infty$. For the overall solution $p(x)$ to approach zero, the coefficient of this unbounded term must be zero. Therefore, we must have $C_1=0$. The solution simplifies to:\n$$p(x) = C_2 \\exp(-kx)$$\nApplying the first boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$p(0) = p_0 = C_2 \\exp(-k \\cdot 0) = C_2$$\nThus, $C_2 = p_0$. The specific solution describing the oxygen profile is:\n$$p(x) = p_0 \\exp(-kx) = p_0 \\exp\\left(-x\\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha}{D}}\\right)$$\nThe characteristic oxygen penetration depth, $\\lambda$, is the spatial scale of the exponential decay. By comparing the solution to the form $p(x) = p_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, we can identify $\\lambda = 1/k$. Therefore, the characteristic length is:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha}{D}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\alpha}}$$\nNext, we determine the largest niche thickness $R^{\\ast}$ such that $p(x) \\geq p_c$ for all $x \\in [0, R^{\\ast}]$. Since $p(x)$ is a monotonically decreasing function for $x \\geq 0$, the minimum value of $p(x)$ on the interval $[0, R^{\\ast}]$ occurs at $x = R^{\\ast}$. The condition is satisfied if $p(R^{\\ast}) \\geq p_c$. The largest value of $R^{\\ast}$ corresponds to the case where equality holds:\n$$p(R^{\\ast}) = p_c$$\nSubstituting the solution for $p(x)$:\n$$p_0 \\exp(-R^{\\ast}/\\lambda) = p_c$$\nWe solve for $R^{\\ast}$:\n$$\\exp(-R^{\\ast}/\\lambda) = \\frac{p_c}{p_0}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\frac{R^{\\ast}}{\\lambda} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_c}{p_0}\\right)$$\nUsing the identity $\\ln(a/b) = -\\ln(b/a)$:\n$$-\\frac{R^{\\ast}}{\\lambda} = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{p_0}{p_c}\\right)$$\n$$R^{\\ast} = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_0}{p_c}\\right)$$\nFinally, we evaluate $R^{\\ast}$ numerically with the given values:\n$D = 2.0 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{μm}^{2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$, $\\alpha = 1.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$, $p_0 = 40$, and $p_c = 10$.\nFirst, calculate the characteristic length $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\alpha}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{μm}^{2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}}} = \\sqrt{2.0 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\text{μm}^2} = 100\\sqrt{2}\\ \\text{μm}$$\nNow, calculate $R^{\\ast}$:\n$$R^{\\ast} = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_0}{p_c}\\right) = (100\\sqrt{2})\\ \\ln\\left(\\frac{40}{10}\\right) = (100\\sqrt{2}) \\ln(4)\\ \\text{μm}$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(4) = \\ln(2^2) = 2\\ln(2)$:\n$$R^{\\ast} = (100\\sqrt{2}) (2\\ln(2)) = 200\\sqrt{2}\\ln(2)\\ \\text{μm}$$\nNumerically, this evaluates to:\n$$R^{\\ast} \\approx 200 \\times (1.41421356...) \\times (0.69314718...)\\ \\text{μm} \\approx 196.0665\\ \\text{μm}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $196.1\\ \\text{μm}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{196.1}$$", "id": "4931464"}, {"introduction": "Finally, we turn our attention to the stem cells themselves as they compete for survival within the niche.

We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem describes a Moran process for a population of $N$ stem cells. At each time step, one cell is randomly chosen for division and one cell is randomly chosen for displacement from the niche. The total population size remains constant at $N$. We are interested in the fate of a single neutral mutant clone introduced at time $t=0$.\n\nLet $k$ be the number of mutant stem cells in the niche, where $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$.

Since the mutant is neutral, any cell has a probability of $1/N$ of being chosen for division and a probability of $1/N$ of being chosen for displacement.

The key feature of neutrality in this Moran model is that the probability of the mutant count increasing by one, $P_{k, k+1}$, is exactly equal to the probability of it decreasing by one, $P_{k, k-1}$. This makes the number of mutants, $k(t)$, a martingale process, meaning its expected value does not change over time: $E[k(t+1) | k(t)=k] = k$. Consequently, the expected number of mutants at any time $t$ is equal to the initial number, $E[k(t)] = k(0) = 1$. The process is an unbiased random walk. Despite the expected number of mutants remaining constant at $1$, the variance of the process increases over time, and individual realizations of the process will fluctuate until they inevitably reach one of the absorbing boundaries, $0$ or $N$. The initial frequency of the mutant, $1/N$, directly determines its probability of eventual success. Most single mutant clones ($N-1$ out of $N$, on average) are lost to stochastic drift, but the one that succeeds will take over the entire niche.
