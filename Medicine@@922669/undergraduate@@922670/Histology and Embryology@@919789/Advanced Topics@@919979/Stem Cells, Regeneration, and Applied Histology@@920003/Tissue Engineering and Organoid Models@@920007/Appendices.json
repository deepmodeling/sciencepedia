It describes a standard reaction-diffusion model in biotransport phenomena, which is a core concept in tissue engineering. The governing equation is a direct application of Fick's second law at steady-state with a zero-order reaction term. The boundary conditions are physically realistic and sufficient to determine a unique solution. The language is precise and quantitative. No scientific, logical, or structural flaws are present.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Oxygen Concentration Profile $c(r)$\n\nThe governing equation is given as:\n$$D \\nabla^2 c - q = 0$$\nGiven the spherical symmetry, the concentration $c$ is a function of the radial position $r$ only, $c(r)$. The Laplacian operator, $\\nabla^2$, in spherical coordinates simplifies to:\n$$\\nabla^2 c(r) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} \\right)$$\nSubstituting this into the governing equation gives an ordinary differential equation for $c(r)$:\n$$D \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} \\right) - q = 0$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $c(r)$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} \\right) = \\frac{q}{D} r^2$$\nWe proceed by integrating this equation twice. Integrating with respect to $r$ for the first time yields:\n$$r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} = \\int \\frac{q}{D} r^2 dr = \\frac{q}{3D} r^3 + A$$\nwhere $A$ is the first constant of integration. We can express the concentration gradient $\\frac{dc}{dr}$ as:\n$$\\frac{dc}{dr} = \\frac{q}{3D} r + \\frac{A}{r^2}$$\nTo determine the constant $A$, we apply the boundary condition at the center, $r=0$. The problem states \"symmetry at the center implying a finite gradient at $r=0$\". For the concentration profile to be physically realistic (i.e., non-singular) at the origin, the concentration gradient $\\frac{dc}{dr}$ must be finite as $r \\to 0$. The term $\\frac{A}{r^2}$ is singular and approaches infinity as $r \\to 0$ unless $A=0$. Therefore, the physical condition of a finite concentration and flux at the center requires that $A=0$. This is equivalent to the no-flux boundary condition at the center, $\\frac{dc}{dr}\\Big|_{r=0} = 0$, which arises from the symmetry of the problem.\n\nSetting $A=0$, the equation for the gradient becomes:\n$$\\frac{dc}{dr} = \\frac{q}{3D} r$$\nNow, we integrate a second time with respect to $r$ to find the concentration profile $c(r)$:\n$$c(r) = \\int \\frac{q}{3D} r dr = \\frac{q}{6D} r^2 + B$$\nwhere $B$ is the second constant of integration. We determine $B$ using the boundary condition at the surface of the organoid, $c(R) = c_s$:\n$$c(R) = \\frac{q}{6D} R^2 + B = c_s$$\nSolving for $B$:\n$$B = c_s - \\frac{q}{6D} R^2$$\nSubstituting this expression for $B$ back into the equation for $c(r)$, we obtain the steady-state oxygen concentration profile inside the organoid:\n$$c(r) = \\frac{q}{6D} r^2 + \\left( c_s - \\frac{q}{6D} R^2 \\right)$$\nThis can be written more intuitively as:\n$$c(r) = c_s - \\frac{q}{6D} (R^2 - r^2)$$\n\n### Determination of the Maximum Critical Radius $R_{crit}$\n\nThe problem poses a viability requirement that the oxygen concentration at the center of the organoid, $c(0)$, must be greater than or equal to a critical threshold, $c_{crit}$.\n$$c(0) \\ge c_{crit}$$\nFirst, we find the concentration at the center by setting $r=0$ in our derived profile for $c(r)$:\n$$c(0) = c_s - \\frac{q}{6D} (R^2 - 0^2) = c_s - \\frac{q R^2}{6D}$$\nNow, we apply the viability inequality:\n$$c_s - \\frac{q R^2}{6D} \\ge c_{crit}$$\nThe maximum allowable radius, which we denote as $R_{crit}$, is the radius at which the central concentration is exactly equal to the critical value, $c_{crit}$. If the radius were any larger, $c(0)$ would fall below $c_{crit}$. Thus, we set $R = R_{crit}$ and replace the inequality with an equality:\n$$c_s - \\frac{q R_{crit}^2}{6D} = c_{crit}$$\nOur objective is to solve this equation for $R_{crit}$. We rearrange the terms to isolate $R_{crit}^2$:\n$$\\frac{q R_{crit}^2}{6D} = c_s - c_{crit}$$\n$$R_{crit}^2 = \\frac{6D(c_s - c_{crit})}{q}$$\nFinally, taking the square root of both sides gives the expression for the maximum critical radius. We take the positive root, as a radius must be a positive quantity.\n$$R_{crit} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6D(c_s - c_{crit})}{q}}$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the maximum allowable radius of the organoid such that the central core remains viable. This expression is physically meaningful, assuming $c_s > c_{crit}$, and shows that the critical radius increases with a higher diffusion coefficient $D$ and a larger difference between surface and critical concentrations ($c_s - c_{crit}$), and decreases with a higher metabolic consumption rate $q$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{6D(c_s - c_{crit})}{q}}}\n$$", "id": "4942872"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple survival, the true power of organoids is their capacity for self-organization into complex, patterned tissues that resemble their in vivo counterparts.

The Wnt concentration at the original crypt location ($x=0$) is now $W_{\\text{rev}}(0) = 100 e^{-3} \\approx 4.98$ a.u., which is well below the crypt threshold $T_C$.\n-   **C. Duplicated crypts form at both ends...**: This is incorrect. The exponential function $W_{\\text{rev}}(x)$ is strictly monotonic, so it can only cross each threshold once.\n-   **D. Partial inversion occurs: the TA domain compresses while the villus domain expands...**: This is incorrect. Our calculations show that the domain widths are preserved. The exponential decay shape is nonlinear, but the mapping $x \\to (L-x)$ is a simple reflection, which preserves the \"length\" of concentration intervals and thus the widths of the resulting domains.\n\nTherefore, option A is the only correct description of the outcome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4942811"}, {"introduction": "Cells are not only governed by chemical signals but are also highly responsive to physical forces, a principle central to the field of mechanobiology.

For steady, fully developed, incompressible laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid between two infinite parallel plates, the $x$-component of the Navier-Stokes momentum equation reduces to a balance between pressure and viscous forces:\n$$ \\frac{d^2u}{dy^2} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nHere, $u(y)$ is the velocity profile in the $x$-direction, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and $\\frac{dp}{dx}$ is the constant pressure gradient driving the flow.\n\nWe integrate this equation twice with respect to $y$:\n$$ \\frac{du}{dy} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y + C_1 $$\n$$ u(y) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y^2 + C_1 y + C_2 $$\nThe integration constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined by applying the no-slip boundary conditions at the walls, $u(y=0)=0$ and $u(y=h)=0$.\nFrom $u(0)=0$:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (0)^2 + C_1(0) + C_2 \\implies C_2 = 0 $$\nFrom $u(h)=0$:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} h^2 + C_1 h \\implies C_1 = -\\frac{h}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nSubstituting the constants back into the velocity profile equation gives the parabolic velocity profile:\n$$ u(y) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y^2 - \\frac{h}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (y^2 - hy) $$\nFor flow to occur in the positive $x$-direction, the pressure must decrease, so $\\frac{dp}{dx}  0$.\n\nNext, we relate the pressure gradient to the volumetric flow rate $Q$.

We perform the unit conversion:\n- $1\\,\\mathrm{m}^3 = 10^9\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$\n- $1\\,\\mathrm{min} = 60\\,\\mathrm{s} \\implies 1\\,\\mathrm{s} = \\frac{1}{60}\\,\\mathrm{min}$\nTherefore, the conversion factor is:\n$$ 1\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{m}^3}{\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{10^9\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}}{\\frac{1}{60}\\,\\mathrm{min}} = 60 \\times 10^9\\,\\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{min}} $$\nApplying this conversion to $Q_{\\min}$:\n$$ Q_{\\min} \\approx (3.7037 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\mathrm{m}^3 \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times \\left(60 \\times 10^9\\,\\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{min}}{\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{s}}\\right) $$\n$$ Q_{\\min} \\approx 3.7037 \\times 60 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{min} \\approx 222.222... \\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{min} $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as requested:\n$$ Q_{\\min} \\approx 222\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{min} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{222}$$", "id": "4942794"}]}
