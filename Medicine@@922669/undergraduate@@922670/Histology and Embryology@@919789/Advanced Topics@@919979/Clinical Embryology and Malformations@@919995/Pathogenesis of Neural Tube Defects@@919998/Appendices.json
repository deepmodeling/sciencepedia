The equation $D \\nabla^{2} c - \\lambda c = 0$ is a valid steady-state formulation for a substance that diffuses and undergoes first-order degradation.

It is a valid problem. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe governing equation for the steady-state concentration $c(x)$ is the second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation:\n$$D \\frac{d^{2} c}{dx^{2}} - \\lambda c = 0$$\nThis equation can be rewritten as:\n$$\\frac{d^{2} c}{dx^{2}} - \\frac{\\lambda}{D} c = 0$$\nThis is a standard form. We define a characteristic length scale, often denoted as the decay length, by the constant $k = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{D}}$. The equation then becomes:\n$$\\frac{d^{2} c}{dx^{2}} - k^{2} c = 0$$\nThe characteristic equation for this ODE is $r^{2} - k^{2} = 0$, which has roots $r_1 = k$ and $r_2 = -k$. The general solution is a linear combination of the exponential functions corresponding to these roots:\n$$c(x) = A e^{kx} + B e^{-kx}$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nNext, we apply the two boundary conditions provided.\n\n**Boundary Condition 1: Concentration vanishes far from the source.**\nWe are given that $c(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$. Let's examine the general solution in this limit. Since $D > 0$ and $\\lambda > 0$, the constant $k = \\sqrt{\\lambda/D}$ is real and positive.\nAs $x \\to \\infty$, the term $e^{-kx}$ approaches $0$, while the term $e^{kx}$ grows without bound. For the overall concentration $c(x)$ to approach $0$, the coefficient of the unbounded term must be zero. Therefore, we must have:\n$$A = 0$$\nThis simplifies the solution to:\n$$c(x) = B e^{-kx}$$\n\n**Boundary Condition 2: Constant outward flux at the source.**\nThe diffusive flux $J(x)$ is given by Fick's first law:\n$$J(x) = -D \\frac{dc}{dx}$$\nThe problem states there is a constant outward flux $S$ at the source plane $x=0$. In our one-dimensional system where $x$ increases dorsally (away from the source), an outward flux corresponds to a positive flux in the $+x$ direction. So, we have the condition:\n$$J(0) = S$$\nFirst, we find the derivative of our simplified solution $c(x) = B e^{-kx}$:\n$$\\frac{dc}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} (B e^{-kx}) = -kB e^{-kx}$$\nNow, we evaluate the flux $J(x)$ at $x=0$:\n$$J(0) = -D \\frac{dc}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = -D (-kB e^{-k \\cdot 0}) = DkB$$\nEquating this to the given flux $S$:\n$$DkB = S$$\nWe can now solve for the constant $B$:\n$$B = \\frac{S}{Dk}$$\nNow we substitute the expression for $B$ back into the solution for $c(x)$:\n$$c(x) = \\left(\\frac{S}{Dk}\\right) e^{-kx}$$\nTo express the solution in terms of the original parameters $S$, $D$, and $\\lambda$, we substitute back $k = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{D}}$:\n$$c(x) = \\frac{S}{D\\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{D}}} \\exp\\left(-x\\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{D}}\\right)$$\nThe pre-factor can be simplified:\n$$\\frac{S}{D\\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{D}}} = \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{D^2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{D}}} = \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{D^2 \\cdot \\frac{\\lambda}{D}}} = \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{D\\lambda}}$$\nThus, the final expression for the steady-state concentration profile is:\n$$c(x) = \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{D\\lambda}} \\exp\\left(-x\\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{D}}\\right)$$\n\n**Calculation of Concentration at the Median Hinge Point**\nThe problem asks for the Shh concentration at the median hinge point, which is located at the dorsal distance $x = L$. We evaluate the derived function $c(x)$ at $x=L$:\n$$c(L) = \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{D\\lambda}} \\exp\\left(-L\\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{D}}\\right)$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the concentration at the specified location. Dimensional analysis confirms that this expression has units of concentration $[\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}]$, as required.\nUnits of the argument of the exponential: $[L] \\sqrt{[\\lambda]/[D]} = [\\text{m}] \\sqrt{[\\text{s}^{-1}] / [\\text{m}^2\\,\\text{s}^{-1}]} = [\\text{m}] / [\\text{m}] = 1$ (dimensionless).\nUnits of the pre-factor: $[S] / \\sqrt{[D][\\lambda]} = [\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}] / \\sqrt{[\\text{m}^2\\,\\text{s}^{-1}][\\text{s}^{-1}]} = [\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}] / [\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}] = [\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}]$ (concentration).\nThe expression is dimensionally correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{S}{\\sqrt{D\\lambda}} \\exp\\left(-L\\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{D}}\\right)}$$", "id": "4921849"}, {"introduction": "Morphogenesis translates molecular patterns into physical form.

Consider a simplified biophysical model in which the apical constriction rate $R$ is proportional to the effective level of active myosin II, denoted $M$, so that $R = k M$, where $k$ is a proportionality constant that depends on cell geometry and cytoskeletal coupling. Let baseline activity be $M_{0} = 1$, which defines the baseline rate $R_{0} = k M_{0}$. A ROCK inhibitor reduces effective myosin II activity by a fraction $0.40$ from baseline.

The core of the model is the relationship between the apical constriction rate, $R$, and the effective level of active myosin II, $M$.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental relationships based on the provided information. The rate $R$ is directly proportional to the myosin activity $M$, given by the equation:\n$$R = k M$$\nwhere $k$ is a proportionality constant.\n\nThe baseline condition is defined with a normalized myosin activity level of $M_{0} = 1$. The corresponding baseline constriction rate is $R_{0}$:\n$$R_{0} = k M_{0}$$\nBy substituting $M_{0} = 1$ into this equation, we can express the constant $k$ in terms of the baseline rate $R_{0}$:\n$$R_{0} = k(1) \\implies k = R_{0}$$\nThis allows us to re-express the general rate equation in terms of the baseline rate $R_{0}$ and the myosin activity level $M$:\n$$R = R_{0} M$$\n\nNext, we determine the new state of the system in the presence of the ROCK inhibitor. The problem states that the inhibitor reduces effective myosin II activity *by* a fraction of $0.40$ from the baseline level $M_{0}$. The new activity level, which we can call $M'$, is therefore the baseline activity minus the reduction:\n$$M' = M_{0} - (0.40 \\times M_{0}) = (1 - 0.40) M_{0}$$\nGiven that $M_{0} = 1$, the new activity level is:\n$$M' = (1 - 0.40) \\times 1 = 0.60$$\n\nWith this new myosin activity level, we can calculate the corresponding apical constriction rate, which we'll call $R'$, using the general rate equation:\n$$R' = R_{0} M' = R_{0} \\times 0.60 = 0.60 R_{0}$$\n\nThe problem defines a minimum rate, $R_{\\min}$, required for successful neural tube closure.
