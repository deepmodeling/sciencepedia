The problem is objective, quantitative, and free from ambiguity or scientific error.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe transport of solvent (water) across the cell membrane is described by the Kedem-Katchalsky phenomenological equation for the volumetric flux, $J_V$. This flux is defined as the volume of fluid crossing a unit area of the membrane per unit time. The relationship is given by:\n$$J_V = \\frac{1}{A_m} \\frac{dV}{dt} = L_p (\\Delta P - \\sigma \\Delta \\Pi_s)$$\nwhere $V$ is the cell volume, $t$ is time, $A_m$ is the membrane surface area, $L_p$ is the hydraulic conductivity of the membrane, $\\Delta P$ is the hydrostatic pressure difference across the membrane (extracellular minus intracellular), $\\sigma$ is the reflection coefficient of the membrane to the solute, and $\\Delta \\Pi_s$ is the osmotic pressure difference across the membrane due to the permeating solute (cryoprotectant).\n\nThe problem asks for the instantaneous rate of change of the blastomere volume, $dV/dt$.

The problem states that there is no initial hydrostatic pressure difference, so $\\Delta P = 0$. The intracellular cryoprotectant concentration is initially zero, so $C_i(t=0^{+}) = C_i(0) = 0$.
