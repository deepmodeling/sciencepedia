This means one homolog carries the haplotype $v g^+ b$ and the other homolog carries $v g b^+$.

After deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication, each homologous pair forms a bivalent composed of $4$ chromatids (two sister chromatids per homolog). Assume meiosis proceeds in the canonical manner: homologous chromosomes pair during prophase I, segregate to opposite poles at anaphase I, and sister chromatids segregate at anaphase II. Independent assortment of homologous pairs occurs because each bivalent’s orientation at metaphase I is random and independent of the others.\n\nDefine a haploid gamete’s “karyotype pattern” as the parental-origin identity of the chromatid inherited for each chromosome, with the following models for how chromatids can be composed:\n\n- Scenario A (no recombination): chromatids remain entirely maternal or entirely paternal for each chromosome, because no crossing over occurs between homologous chromosomes.\n- Scenario B (recombination): exactly one crossover occurs in prophase I in each bivalent between non-sister chromatids at a single site per chromosome, such that each chromosome is partitioned into two distinguishable segments (for example, proximal and distal to the crossover), and two recombinant chromatids and two non-recombinant chromatids are present in the bivalent.\n\nUsing only the core definitions of meiotic stages and independent assortment, and without invoking any pre-packaged counting formulas, derive from first principles the number of distinct haploid gamete karyotype patterns that can arise under Scenario A and under Scenario B.

No rounding is required, and no units should be included in your final answer.", "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of meiosis, well-posed with clear definitions, and objective. It contains no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the number of distinct haploid gamete karyotype patterns under two scenarios: Scenario B (with recombination) and Scenario A (without recombination). We will derive the number of patterns for each scenario from first principles.\n\nThe organism is diploid with $2n=6$, meaning it has $n=3$ pairs of homologous chromosomes.\n\n**Scenario A: No Recombination**\n\nIn this scenario, no crossing over occurs. A haploid gamete is formed at the end of meiosis II and contains $n=3$ chromosomes, one from each homologous pair. We need to determine the number of unique combinations of parental origins for these $3$ chromosomes.\n\nConsider the first homologous pair. During meiosis I, the maternal and paternal homologous chromosomes (each composed of two identical sister chromatids) are segregated to opposite poles. Consequently, a resulting secondary meiocyte will receive either the maternal chromosome or the paternal chromosome, but not both. After meiosis II, where sister chromatids separate, the final gamete will inherit a chromatid that is either entirely of maternal origin or entirely of paternal origin. Thus, for the first chromosome, there are $2$ possibilities for its parental origin.\n\nThe same logic applies independently to the second and third homologous pairs.\n- For chromosome pair $1$, there are $2$ options (maternal or paternal).\n- For chromosome pair $2$, there are $2$ options (maternal or paternal).\n- For chromosome pair $3$, there are $2$ options (maternal or paternal).\n\nThe principle of independent assortment states that the orientation of each homologous pair (bivalent) at the metaphase I plate is random and independent of the others. Therefore, the parental origin of the chromosome inherited for one pair is independent of the parental origin inherited for the other pairs.\n\nTo find the total number of distinct combinations, or \"karyotype patterns,\" we multiply the number of possibilities for each chromosome. Let $N_A$ be the total number of distinct patterns in Scenario A.\n\n$$N_A = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^n$$\nGiven $n=3$:\n$$N_A = 2^3 = 8$$\n\n**Scenario B: Recombination**\n\nIn this scenario, exactly one crossover occurs in each of the $n=3$ bivalents. Let's analyze the consequences for a single homologous pair.\n\nA bivalent consists of four chromatids: two sister chromatids from the maternal homolog and two sister chromatids from the paternal homolog. Let's denote a maternal chromatid as $M$ and a paternal one as $P$. Before crossover, we have the set $\\{M, M, P, P\\}$. A single crossover occurs between two non-sister chromatids (e.g., one $M$ and one $P$).\n\nAfter this exchange, the four chromatids within the bivalent are no longer identical in pairs. The two chromatids involved in the crossover become recombinant, while the other two remain non-recombinant (parental). The four resulting chromatids are:\n1.  One non-recombinant maternal chromatid ($M$).\n2.  One non-recombinant paternal chromatid ($P$).\n3.  One recombinant chromatid ($R_1$), which is composed of a maternal segment and a paternal segment (e.g., proximal-maternal, distal-paternal).\n4.  A second, distinct recombinant chromatid ($R_2$), which is the reciprocal of the first (e.g., proximal-paternal, distal-maternal).\n\nThese four chromatids are all distinct in their parental-origin composition.\n\nDuring meiosis I, the homologous chromosomes segregate. One secondary meiocyte receives a chromosome composed of the $\\{M, R_1\\}$ chromatid pair (assuming the crossover was between one chromatid of each homolog), and the other secondary meiocyte receives the chromosome with the $\\{P, R_2\\}$ pair.\n\nIn meiosis II, the sister chromatids separate.\n- The first secondary meiocyte produces two gametes: one containing the non-recombinant maternal chromatid ($M$) and one containing the recombinant chromatid ($R_1$).\n- The second secondary meiocyte produces two gametes: one with the non-recombinant paternal chromatid ($P$) and one with the other recombinant chromatid ($R_2$).\n\nTherefore, for a single chromosome pair where one crossover has occurred, the meiotic process can produce four distinct types of chromatids that can be passed to a gamete. The pool of possible gametes produced by the organism will contain all four types for that chromosome.\n\nThis applies to each of the $n=3$ chromosome pairs.\n- For chromosome pair $1$, there are $4$ possible chromatid patterns in a gamete.\n- For chromosome pair $2$, there are $4$ possible chromatid patterns in a gamete.\n- For chromosome pair $3$, there are $4$ possible chromatid patterns in a gamete.\n\nDue to independent assortment, the pattern of the chromatid inherited for chromosome $1$ is independent of the patterns for chromosomes $2$ and $3$. Let $N_B$ be the total number of distinct karyotype patterns in Scenario B.\n\n$$N_B = 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 4^n$$\nGiven $n=3$:\n$$N_B = 4^3 = 64$$\n\n**Calculation of the Ratio R**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $R$, defined as:\n$$R = \\frac{\\text{number of distinct haploid gamete karyotype patterns in Scenario B}}{\\text{number of distinct haploid gamete karyotype patterns in Scenario A}} = \\frac{N_B}{N_A}$$\n\nSubstituting the values we derived:\n$$R = \\frac{64}{8}$$\n$$R = 8$$\n\nAlternatively, using the general formulas for $n$ pairs:\n$$R = \\frac{4^n}{2^n} = \\left(\\frac{4}{2}\\right)^n = 2^n$$\nFor $n=3$, this gives:\n$$R = 2^3 = 8$$\nThe result is a single real number.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "4914470"}, {"introduction": "The intricate choreography of meiosis must be executed with near-perfect fidelity to produce healthy, euploid gametes.

In normal meiosis I, sister kinetochores of each homolog co-orient toward the same pole and homologs segregate reductionally, with sister chromatids remaining together, followed by equational segregation of sister chromatids in meiosis II. Suppose that, due to a defect in the meiosis I mono-orientation machinery, the sister kinetochores aberrantly biorient in meiosis I for this focal homologous pair with probability $s$, where $0 < s < 1$. Assume that:\n- The rest of the genome segregates normally and can be ignored for the copy-number analysis of the focal chromosome.\n- When sister kinetochores of the focal pair biorient in meiosis I, sister chromatids separate equationally at meiosis I (precocious separation), producing in each meiosis I daughter cell a single chromatid from each homolog of the focal pair.\n- In meiosis II, each single chromatid behaves as an independent univalent whose kinetochore orientation toward either pole is random and independent, consistent with the law of segregation and the absence of inter-sister cohesion at this stage.

It presents a well-defined probabilistic model that is internally consistent and contains all necessary information to derive a solution. The variables and conditions are stated objectively and precisely. The problem is well-posed, asking for expected values based on given probabilities, which leads to a unique solution. The setup is not trivial and requires a logical breakdown of probabilistic events. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation of the gamete fractions requires analyzing two mutually exclusive scenarios for meiosis I segregation of the focal chromosome pair, weighted by their respective probabilities.\n\nLet's denote the state of a gamete by its copy number of the focal chromosome: euploid ($N=1$), disomic ($N=2$), or nullisomic ($N=0$). We will calculate the final expected fraction of each gamete type using the law of total probability.\n\n$F_{type} = P(\\text{Normal MI}) \\times F_{type|\\text{Normal MI}} + P(\\text{Aberrant MI}) \\times F_{type|\\text{Aberrant MI}}$\n\nwhere $F_{type}$ is the fraction of gametes of a specific type (euploid, disomic, or nullisomic) and MI stands for Meiosis I.\n\n**Case 1: Normal Meiosis I (Co-orientation)**\n\nThis event occurs with probability $1-s$.\nIn normal meiosis I, homologous chromosomes segregate. The germ cell initially contains one replicated paternal chromosome and one replicated maternal chromosome. After segregation, one secondary meiocyte receives the replicated paternal chromosome (composed of two sister chromatids) and the other secondary meiocyte receives the replicated maternal chromosome (also two sister chromatids).\n\nIn meiosis II, which proceeds normally in this case, the sister chromatids separate.\n- The secondary meiocyte with the paternal chromosome produces two gametes, each containing one paternal chromatid. Both are euploid ($N=1$).\n- The secondary meiocyte with the maternal chromosome produces two gametes, each containing one maternal chromatid. Both are euploid ($N=1$).\n\nTherefore, when meiosis I is normal, all $4$ resulting gametes are euploid. The fractions of gamete types conditional on a normal meiosis I are:\n- $F_{\\text{euploid}|\\text{Normal MI}} = 1$\n- $F_{\\text{disomic}|\\text{Normal MI}} = 0$\n- $F_{\\text{nullisomic}|\\text{Normal MI}} = 0$\n\n**Case 2: Aberrant Meiosis I (Biorientation and Precocious Separation)**\n\nThis event occurs with probability $s$.\nIn this scenario, sister chromatids separate precociously at meiosis I instead of homologous chromosomes. The problem states that each daughter cell of meiosis I receives \"a single chromatid from each homolog\". This means both secondary meiocytes formed after meiosis I will contain one chromatid from the paternal homolog and one from the maternal homolog. These are non-sister, non-homologous chromatids, which act as univalents.\n\nNow, we analyze meiosis II for these secondary meiocytes. Each secondary meiocyte contains two univalents. According to the problem, these univalents segregate randomly. There are two possibilities for their segregation:\n\n1.  **Segregation to opposite poles:** The two univalents move to opposite poles of the meiotic spindle. This occurs with probability $1/2$. This division results in two gametes, each containing exactly one chromatid. These are both euploid ($N=1$) gametes.\n2.  **Segregation to the same pole:** Both univalents move to the same pole. This occurs with probability $1/2$. This division results in one gamete containing both chromatids (a disomic, $N=2$ gamete) and one gamete containing no chromatids (a nullisomic, $N=0$ gamete).\n\nSince both secondary meiocytes have the same univalent composition, this probabilistic outcome applies to the division of each. To find the overall fraction of gametes from a single aberrant meiotic event, we consider the expected number of each gamete type out of the total $4$ gametes produced.\n\nFrom one secondary meiocyte, the expected number of gametes of each type are:\n- Expected euploid: $2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} + 0 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 1$\n- Expected disomic: $0 \\times \\frac{1}{2} + 1 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- Expected nullisomic: $0 \\times \\frac{1}{2} + 1 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSince the initial germ cell produces two such secondary meiocytes, the total expected number of each gamete type out of the $4$ total gametes are:\n- Total expected euploid: $1 + 1 = 2$\n- Total expected disomic: $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$\n- Total expected nullisomic: $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$\n\nThus, the fractions of gamete types conditional on an aberrant meiosis I are:\n- $F_{\\text{euploid}|\\text{Aberrant MI}} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- $F_{\\text{disomic}|\\text{Aberrant MI}} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- $F_{\\text{nullisomic}|\\text{Aberrant MI}} = \\frac{1}{4}$\nThe sum of these conditional fractions is $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$, as expected.\n\n**Combining the Cases**\n\nWe can now calculate the total expected fractions by combining the results from both cases using the law of total probability.\n\n**Fraction of Euploid Gametes ($F_{eu}$):**\n$F_{eu} = P(\\text{Normal MI}) \\times F_{\\text{euploid}|\\text{Normal MI}} + P(\\text{Aberrant MI}) \\times F_{\\text{euploid}|\\text{Aberrant MI}}$\n$F_{eu} = (1-s) \\times 1 + s \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 1 - s + \\frac{s}{2} = 1 - \\frac{s}{2}$\n\n**Fraction of Disomic Gametes ($F_{di}$):**\n$F_{di} = P(\\text{Normal MI}) \\times F_{\\text{disomic}|\\text{Normal MI}} + P(\\text{Aberrant MI}) \\times F_{\\text{disomic}|\\text{Aberrant MI}}$\n$F_{di} = (1-s) \\times 0 + s \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{s}{4}$\n\n**Fraction of Nullisomic Gametes ($F_{nulli}$):**\n$F_{nulli} = P(\\text{Normal MI}) \\times F_{\\text{nullisomic}|\\text{Normal MI}} + P(\\text{Aberrant MI}) \\times F_{\\text{nullisomic}|\\text{Aberrant MI}}$\n$F_{nulli} = (1-s) \\times 0 + s \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{s}{4}$\n\nAs a final verification, the sum of these fractions must be $1$:\n$F_{eu} + F_{di} + F_{nulli} = \\left(1 - \\frac{s}{2}\\right) + \\frac{s}{4} + \\frac{s}{4} = 1 - \\frac{2s}{4} + \\frac{2s}{4} = 1$.\nThe results are consistent.\nThe fractions are: Euploid: $1 - \\frac{s}{2}$, Disomic: $\\frac{s}{4}$, Nullisomic: $\\frac{s}{4}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 - \\frac{s}{2} & \\frac{s}{4} & \\frac{s}{4} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4914468"}]}
