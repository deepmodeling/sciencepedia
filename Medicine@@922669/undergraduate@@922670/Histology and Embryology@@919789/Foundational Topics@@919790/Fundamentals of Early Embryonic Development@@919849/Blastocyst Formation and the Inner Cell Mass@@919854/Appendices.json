It is scientifically grounded in established principles of developmental biology and biophysics, well-posed with a clear theoretical framework, and objective in its language. The problem is self-contained and allows for a unique solution to be derived from the provided foundational bases.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe problem asks to predict the effect of blocking E-cadherin function on two key observables during mouse embryo compaction: the mean contact angle $\\theta$ between blastomeres and the proportion of inside versus outside cells. The prediction will be based on the principle of minimizing total interfacial free energy.\n\nLet us define the relevant physical quantities:\n- $\\gamma_{cm}$ represents the interfacial tension (energy per unit area) at the interface between a cell and the external medium. This tension is generated by the actomyosin cortex.\n- $\\gamma_{cc}$ represents the interfacial tension at the interface between two adjacent cells.\n\nThe total interfacial free energy, $G$, of the embryo is the sum of the energies of all interfaces:\n$$G = A_{cc} \\gamma_{cc} + A_{cm} \\gamma_{cm}$$\nwhere $A_{cc}$ is the total area of all cell-cell interfaces and $A_{cm}$ is the total area of all cell-medium interfaces.\n\nAccording to the provided foundational bases:\n1.  E-cadherin mediates homophilic adhesion, which contributes an adhesion energy that *lowers* the energy of a cell-cell interface. Therefore, the effective cell-cell interfacial tension, $\\gamma_{cc}$, is inversely related to the strength of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion. Strong adhesion implies a low $\\gamma_{cc}$.\n2.  The experimental perturbation is the application of a function-blocking antibody to E-cadherin. This action inhibits adhesion.\n3.  Inhibition of adhesion leads to an *increase* in the cell-cell interfacial tension, $\\gamma_{cc}$.\n4.  The cortical tension, $\\gamma_{cm}$, is generated by the actomyosin cortex and is assumed to be unaffected by the E-cadherin blockade. Thus, $\\gamma_{cm}$ is treated as a constant in this context.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Contact Angle ($\\theta$)**\n\nAt a three-phase contact line where two cells meet the external medium, the interfacial tensions must be in mechanical equilibrium. This equilibrium is described by an equation analogous to the Young-Dupré equation. Let us consider the junction of two cells. The tangents to the cell surfaces at this junction form an internal angle $\\theta$, as defined in the problem. The balance of forces projected along the plane of the cell-cell interface is given by:\n$$\\gamma_{cc} = 2 \\gamma_{cm} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the contact angle:\n$$\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\gamma_{cc}}{2 \\gamma_{cm}}$$\nFrom our initial analysis, blocking E-cadherin *increases* $\\gamma_{cc}$, while $\\gamma_{cm}$ remains constant. Consequently, the ratio $\\frac{\\gamma_{cc}}{2 \\gamma_{cm}}$ increases.\n\nThe cosine function, $\\cos(x)$, is a monotonically decreasing function for $x \\in [0, \\pi]$. Since $\\theta$ must be between $0$ and $2\\pi$, $\\theta/2$ is between $0$ and $\\pi$. In this range, if $\\cos(\\theta/2)$ increases, the angle $\\theta/2$ must decrease. Therefore, an increase in $\\gamma_{cc}$ leads to a *decrease* in the mean contact angle $\\theta$.\n\nThis result is consistent with the problem's qualitative description: \"larger $\\theta$ corresponds to more extensive spreading of cells on each other.\" Extensive spreading is a hallmark of strong adhesion (low $\\gamma_{cc}$). Our derivation shows that low $\\gamma_{cc}$ leads to high $\\theta$, which aligns with this description. Conversely, blocking adhesion (high $\\gamma_{cc}$) should lead to less spreading and hence a smaller $\\theta$.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Proportion of Inside vs. Outside Cells**\n\nThe process of compaction, including the formation of inside cells, is driven by the minimization of the total interfacial free energy, $G$. Inside cells are those that have maximized their contact area with neighboring cells, thereby eliminating their own contact area with the external medium.\n\nAn 'inside' cell is energetically favored if the energy cost of creating cell-cell interfaces is significantly lower than the cost of maintaining cell-medium interfaces. The system seeks to replace high-energy cell-medium interfaces with lower-energy cell-cell interfaces.\n\nThe total surface area of all the blastomeres is approximately conserved. For a given blastomere, creating a cell-cell interface of area $\\Delta A$ removes an equivalent area of cell-medium interface from its surface. Because two cells are involved, the total cell-cell interface area increases by $\\Delta A$, while the total cell-medium interface area decreases by $2 \\Delta A$. The change in total free energy is $\\Delta G = \\Delta A \\gamma_{cc} - 2 \\Delta A \\gamma_{cm} = \\Delta A (\\gamma_{cc} - 2 \\gamma_{cm})$.\nFor cell internalization to be favorable, $\\Delta G$ must be negative, meaning $\\gamma_{cc} - 2 \\gamma_{cm} < 0$, or $\\gamma_{cc} < 2 \\gamma_{cm}$.\n\nIn a normal embryo, strong E-cadherin adhesion ensures that $\\gamma_{cc}$ is very low, making the formation of extensive cell-cell contacts and inside cells energetically favorable.\n\nBlocking E-cadherin function *increases* $\\gamma_{cc}$. This increase makes the term $(\\gamma_{cc} - 2 \\gamma_{cm})$ less negative, or potentially even positive. This change reduces the energetic driving force for maximizing cell-cell contact area ($A_{cc}$). As the tendency for cells to adhere to and spread over one another is diminished, the process of envelopment required to form inside cells is inhibited. The cells will tend to remain more rounded and exposed to the medium to minimize the now relatively more costly cell-cell contacts.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of blastomeres that become fully enveloped (inside cells) will decrease. Correspondingly, the fraction of cells that remain on the surface (outside cells) will increase.\n\n**Summary of Predictions:**\n-   Blocking E-cadherin will cause the mean contact angle $\\theta$ to **decrease**.\n-   Blocking E-cadherin will cause the fraction of inside cells to **decrease**.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\nLet us evaluate the provided options based on our derived predictions.\n\n**A. Mean $\\theta$ decreases; the fraction of inside cells decreases (and the fraction of outside cells increases).**\nThis option perfectly matches both predictions from our analysis. A decrease in $\\theta$ reflects reduced cell spreading due to weaker adhesion. A decrease in the fraction of inside cells reflects the reduced energetic favorability of maximizing cell-cell contact, which is also a direct consequence of weaker adhesion.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Mean $\\theta$ increases; the fraction of inside cells increases.**\nThis option describes the opposite effects for both variables. It would be the expected outcome if adhesion were enhanced, not blocked.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Mean $\\theta$ remains unchanged; the fraction of inside cells remains unchanged.**\nThis option implies that blocking the main adhesion molecule has no effect on a process critically dependent on adhesion. This is inconsistent with the provided foundational principles.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Mean $\\theta$ decreases; the fraction of inside cells increases.**\nThis option presents a contradictory scenario. A decrease in $\\theta$ is a sign of poor adhesion, which would inhibit, not promote, the formation of inside cells.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Mean $\\theta$ increases; the fraction of inside cells decreases.**\nThis option is also contradictory. An increase in $\\theta$ would signify stronger adhesion and more spreading, which is physically incompatible with a decrease in inside cell formation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe only option consistent with the application of biophysical principles to the given biological context is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4866767"}, {"introduction": "Following compaction, the defining feature of the blastocyst—the fluid-filled blastocoel—is formed through a process called cavitation.

The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe problem requires analyzing two distinct but coupled effects of inhibiting the Na$^+$/K$^+$ ATPase in trophectoderm (TE) cells: the effect on the blastocoel as a whole, and the effect on the individual TE cells themselves.\n\n**1. Analysis of Blastocoel Size**\n\n- **Initial State (Pre-inhibition):** The problem states that the Na$^+$/K$^+$ ATPase is responsible for the net accumulation of $\\text{Na}^+$ in the blastocoel. This active transport of solutes, primarily $\\text{Na}^+$, into the blastocoel cavity increases its solute concentration, $C_{\\text{blastocoel}}$. According to the van’t Hoff relation, $\\Pi = iCRT$, this creates a high osmotic pressure within the blastocoel, $\\Pi_{\\text{blastocoel}}$. This osmotic pressure is higher than that of the external medium, $\\Pi_{\\text{external}}$.\n- The resulting osmotic pressure difference, $\\Delta \\Pi = \\Pi_{\\text{blastocoel}} - \\Pi_{\\text{external}} > 0$, drives a net flux of water, $J_w$, into the blastocoel across the TE epithelium. This water influx is what inflates and maintains the size of the blastocoel.\n- **Post-inhibition:** The pharmacological inhibitor blocks the Na$^+$/K$^+$ ATPase.\n- The primary pump driving solute accumulation in the blastocoel is now inactive. Net $\\text{Na}^+$ transport into the blastocoel ceases.\n- However, passive leakage of ions out of the blastocoel and across the TE (e.g., through paracellular pathways, however minimal) continues. Without the pump to counteract this leakage, the solute concentration in the blastocoel, $C_{\\text{blastocoel}}$, will begin to decrease.\n- As $C_{\\text{blastocoel}}$ decreases, so does $\\Pi_{\\text{blastocoel}}$. The osmotic gradient, $\\Delta \\Pi$, across the TE diminishes.\n- The water flux into the blastocoel, $J_w = L_p \\Delta \\Pi$, decreases. As $\\Pi_{\\text{blastocoel}}$ falls towards $\\Pi_{\\text{external}}$, the inward water flux will slow, stop, and eventually reverse, leading to a net efflux of water from the blastocoel.\n- Consequently, the blastocoel will lose water and its volume will decrease. It will begin to collapse.\n- **Conclusion for Blastocoel:** Blastocoel size decreases.\n\n**2. Analysis of TE Cell Volume**\n\n- **Initial State (Pre-inhibition):** A primary function of the Na$^+$/K$^+$ ATPase in all animal cells, including TE cells, is to maintain a steep electrochemical gradient for $\\text{Na}^+$. It actively pumps $3$ $\\text{Na}^+$ ions out of the cell for every $2$ $\\text{K}^+$ ions it pumps in. This maintains a low intracellular $\\text{Na}^+$ concentration ($[Na^+]_{\\text{cytosol}}$) and a high intracellular $\\text{K}^+$ concentration ($[K^+]_{\\text{cytosol}}$), and is crucial for cell volume regulation. The cell is in osmotic equilibrium with its surroundings (the external medium and the blastocoel fluid), meaning the total osmotic pressure inside the cell is approximately equal to the osmotic pressure outside.\n- **Post-inhibition:** The inhibitor blocks the Na$^+$/K$^+$ ATPase.\n- The active extrusion of $\\text{Na}^+$ from the TE cell cytosol stops.\n- $\\text{Na}^+$ ions will continue to enter the cell from the external medium and the blastocoel fluid, moving down their steep electrochemical gradient through various channels and transporters. At the same time, $\\text{K}^+$ ions will leak out of the cell down their concentration gradient.\n- The key result of pump inhibition is a net gain of intracellular solutes. The influx of $\\text{Na}^+$ is typically accompanied by anions like $\\text{Cl}^-$ to maintain electroneutrality. This combined influx of $\\text{Na}^+$ and $\\text{Cl}^-$ outweighs the efflux of $\\text{K}^+$, leading to an increase in the total intracellular solute concentration, $C_{\\text{cytosol}}$.\n- This increase in $C_{\\text{cytosol}}$ raises the intracellular osmotic pressure, $\\Pi_{\\text{cytosol}}$, making it higher than the osmotic pressure of the external medium, $\\Pi_{\\text{external}}$.\n- An osmotic gradient is established across the cell membrane, $\\Delta \\Pi = \\Pi_{\\text{cytosol}} - \\Pi_{\\text{external}} > 0$.\n- According to the water flux equation, $J_w = L_p \\Delta \\Pi$, water will move from the surrounding medium (both external and blastocoelic) into the TE cell.\n- This net influx of water causes the TE cell volume to increase. The cell swells.\n- **Conclusion for TE Cells:** TE cells swell.\n\n**Summary of Predictions**\n- The blastocoel size will **decrease**.\n- The TE cell volume will increase, meaning the cells will **swell**.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n- **A. Blastocoel size decreases; TE cells swell.**\nThis option correctly predicts that the cessation of ion pumping into the blastocoel will cause it to lose water and decrease in size. It also correctly predicts that the failure of individual TE cells to extrude $\\text{Na}^+$ will lead to an increase in intracellular solute concentration, causing water influx and cell swelling. This matches our derived conclusions perfectly.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. Blastocoel size increases; TE cells swell.**\nThis option correctly predicts that TE cells will swell. However, it incorrectly predicts that the blastocoel size will increase. Blastocoel expansion requires active ion pumping *into* the cavity, which is the very process being inhibited.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Blastocoel size decreases; TE cells shrink.**\nThis option correctly predicts that the blastocoel size will decrease. However, it incorrectly predicts that TE cells will shrink. Cell shrinkage would require a net loss of intracellular solutes, whereas the inhibition of the Na$^+$/K$^+$ ATPase leads to a net *gain* of intracellular solutes ($\\text{Na}^+$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Blastocoel size increases; TE cells shrink.**\nThis option is incorrect on both counts, as explained in the analyses for options B and C.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4866781"}, {"introduction": "The inflation of the blastocoel creates a pressurized structure, similar to a balloon, where the outward force of the fluid is balanced by tension within the trophectoderm shell.

We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the pressure difference, $\\Delta P$, across a spherical membrane and its subsequent numerical calculation. The derivation is based on the principle of mechanical equilibrium. We consider a hemispherical cap of the trophectoderm (TE) of radius $R$. Two forces act on this cap.\n\nFirst, there is the force due to the internal pressure difference, $\\Delta P$. This pressure acts perpendicularly on the entire inner surface of the hemisphere. To find the net force in a specific direction (e.g., along the axis of symmetry of the hemisphere), we must integrate the component of the pressure force in that direction over the surface area. A more direct method is to recognize that the net force exerted by a uniform pressure on a closed surface is zero. Thus, the force on the curved hemispherical surface is equal and opposite to the force that would be exerted on the flat circular base that closes it. This force, which we denote as $\\vec{F}_P$, acts on the projected area of the hemisphere onto a plane. The projected area is a circle of radius $R$, with area $A = \\pi R^2$. The force is perpendicular to this plane and has a magnitude:\n$$F_P = \\Delta P \\cdot A = \\Delta P \\cdot \\pi R^2$$\n\nSecond, there is the force due to the surface tension, $\\gamma$. The surface tension is defined as force per unit length and acts tangentially to the surface along the boundary of the cut. For our hemispherical cap, this boundary is a circle of radius $R$. The length of this boundary is its circumference, $L = 2 \\pi R$. The total force due to surface tension, which we denote as $\\vec{F}_\\gamma$, is directed inwards, pulling the cap towards the rest of the sphere. The magnitude of this force is:\n$$F_\\gamma = \\gamma \\cdot L = \\gamma \\cdot (2 \\pi R)$$\n\nFor the hemispherical cap to be in mechanical equilibrium, the outward force due to pressure must be exactly balanced by the inward force due to surface tension.\n$$F_P = F_\\gamma$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $F_P$ and $F_\\gamma$:\n$$\\Delta P \\cdot \\pi R^2 = \\gamma \\cdot 2 \\pi R$$\nWe can solve this equation for the pressure difference, $\\Delta P$:\n$$\\Delta P = \\frac{2 \\pi R \\gamma}{\\pi R^2} = \\frac{2 \\gamma}{R}$$\nThis relationship is the Young-Laplace equation for a spherical interface.\n\nNow we proceed to the numerical calculation.
