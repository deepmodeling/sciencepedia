It describes a standard reaction-diffusion model commonly used in developmental biology to understand morphogen gradients. All necessary parameters and boundary conditions are provided for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the steady-state concentration profile $C(x)$ of a morphogen in a one-dimensional tissue, starting from first principles.\n\nFirst, we formulate the governing partial differential equation for the morphogen concentration $C(x,t)$ in a one-dimensional domain $x \\geq 0$. We consider a small segment of the tissue from position $x$ to $x+\\Delta x$ with a uniform cross-sectional area $A$. The total number of morphogen molecules in this volume element is $C(x,t) A \\Delta x$. The principle of mass conservation states that the rate of change of the number of molecules in this volume is equal to the rate at which molecules enter minus the rate at which they leave, plus the rate at which they are produced or consumed within the volume.\n\nThe rate of change of the amount of morphogen is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (C A \\Delta x) = A \\Delta x \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t}$.\n\nThe flux of molecules into the volume at position $x$ is $J(x,t) A$, and the flux out of the volume at position $x+\\Delta x$ is $J(x+\\Delta x, t) A$. The net rate of change due to diffusion is $(J(x,t) - J(x+\\Delta x,t)) A$.\n\nThe morphogen is consumed via a first-order process with rate constant $k$. This means the rate of consumption is proportional to the local concentration $C$. The rate of consumption in the volume element is $(kC) A \\Delta x$.\n\nCombining these terms, the mass balance equation is:\n$$A \\Delta x \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = A(J(x,t) - J(x+\\Delta x,t)) - k C A \\Delta x$$\nDividing by the volume $A \\Delta x$, we get:\n$$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{J(x+\\Delta x,t) - J(x,t)}{\\Delta x} - kC$$\nTaking the limit as $\\Delta x \\to 0$, the first term on the right-hand side becomes the negative of the spatial derivative of the flux:\n$$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} - kC$$\nAccording to Fick's first law of diffusion, the flux $J$ is proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient:\n$$J = -D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. Substituting Fick's law into the conservation equation yields the reaction-diffusion equation:\n$$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(-D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}\\right) - kC$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} - kC$$\nWe are interested in the steady-state concentration profile, $C(x)$, where the concentration no longer changes with time. At steady state, $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = 0$. The governing equation simplifies to an ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$D \\frac{d^2 C}{dx^2} - kC = 0$$\nRearranging the equation, we have:\n$$\\frac{d^2 C}{dx^2} - \\frac{k}{D} C = 0$$\nThis is a second-order, linear, homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. We define the characteristic length scale $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{d^2 C}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} C = 0$$\nThe general solution to this ODE is of the form:\n$$C(x) = A_1 \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) + A_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nwhere $A_1$ and $A_2$ are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  Far from the source, the morphogen concentration vanishes: $C(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$.\n2.  At the source ($x=0$), there is a constant injection flux $J_0$ into the tissue. This means the flux at $x=0$, which is $J(0) = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}\\Big|_{x=0}$, must be equal to $J_0$.\n\nApplying the first boundary condition ($C(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$):\nThe term $A_1 \\exp(x/\\lambda)$ grows exponentially as $x \\to \\infty$. For the concentration to vanish at infinity, the coefficient $A_1$ must be zero. Thus, the solution simplifies to:\n$$C(x) = A_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nNow, we apply the second boundary condition. First, we compute the flux $J(x)$ from this simplified solution:\n$$J(x) = -D \\frac{dC}{dx} = -D \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(A_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$J(x) = -D \\left(-\\frac{A_2}{\\lambda}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) = \\frac{DA_2}{\\lambda} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nAt $x=0$, the flux is given as $J_0$:\n$$J(0) = J_0 = \\frac{DA_2}{\\lambda} \\exp(0) = \\frac{DA_2}{\\lambda}$$\nWe can now solve for the constant $A_2$:\n$$A_2 = \\frac{J_0 \\lambda}{D}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $A_2$ back into the solution for $C(x)$:\n$$C(x) = \\left(\\frac{J_0 \\lambda}{D}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nFinally, we substitute the definition of the characteristic length $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$ to express the solution in terms of the given parameters $J_0$, $D$, and $k$:\n$$C(x) = \\frac{J_0 \\sqrt{D/k}}{D} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{D/k}}\\right)$$\nThe pre-exponential factor simplifies as:\n$$\\frac{J_0}{D}\\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}} = \\frac{J_0}{D} \\frac{\\sqrt{D}}{\\sqrt{k}} = \\frac{J_0}{\\sqrt{D}\\sqrt{k}} = \\frac{J_0}{\\sqrt{Dk}}$$\nThe term in the exponent can be written as:\n$$-\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{D/k}} = -x \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}$$\nThus, the final expression for the steady-state concentration profile is:\n$$C(x) = \\frac{J_0}{\\sqrt{Dk}} \\exp\\left(-x\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)$$\nThe characteristic length scale $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$ has a clear biological interpretation. It represents the distance over which the morphogen concentration decays to $1/e$ (approximately $37\\%$) of its value at the source boundary. This length scale defines the effective spatial range of the morphogen signal. A high diffusion coefficient $D$ or a low degradation rate $k$ results in a larger $\\lambda$, allowing the morphogen to pattern a wider field of cells. Conversely, low diffusion or rapid degradation leads to a smaller $\\lambda$ and a more localized signal. In the context of gastrulation, $\\lambda$ sets the size of the domains that are patterned by the morphogen from the primitive node, thereby controlling the spatial organization and delimitation of different cell fates within the developing trilaminar embryonic disc, which is fundamental for correct notochord formation and overall body plan establishment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{J_{0}}{\\sqrt{Dk}} \\exp\\left(-x\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)}$$", "id": "4893505"}, {"introduction": "Once the mathematical form of a morphogen gradient is established, it can be used as a powerful tool to make quantitative predictions about developmental patterning.

In an otherwise normal embryo, a second notochord is grafted parallel to the endogenous notochord, positioned lateral to the right side of the neural tube such that the graft lies between the neural tube and the right paraxial mesoderm. Use the following foundational facts as your starting point: the notochord is axial mesoderm that secretes the ventralizing morphogen Sonic hedgehog (SHH), the floor plate of the neural tube and ventral neuronal identities require sufficient SHH signaling, paraxial mesoderm adjacent to the notochord responds to SHH by adopting sclerotome fate at the expense of dermomyotome, and dorsalizing cues such as Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) and Wingless-related integration site (WNT) signals arise from surface ectoderm and the roof plate.

The roles of the notochord as a signaling center, SHH as a key ventralizing morphogen, and the opposing dorsalizing signals (BMPs/WNTs) in patterning the neural tube and somites are well-established, cornerstone concepts in the field. The experimental paradigm of grafting a signaling center is a classic and valid technique in experimental embryology.\n*   **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined. It provides an unambiguous initial state, a specific and spatially defined perturbation, and a set of governing principles. The question asks for a prediction based on these principles, which allows for a unique, logical deduction.\n*   **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and free of subjectivity. The \"foundational facts\" are presented as objective premises from which to reason.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed invalidating flaws. It is scientifically sound, logically consistent, complete, and testable in principle.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived based on the provided principles.\n\n**Principle-Based Derivation**\n\nThe patterning of the neural tube and somites along the dorsal-ventral axis is orchestrated by opposing morphogen gradients.\n\n1.  **Ventralizing Signal**: The endogenous notochord, located ventrally to the neural tube, secretes the morphogen SHH (Principle 1). This signal diffuses away from the source, creating a ventral-to-dorsal concentration gradient. The highest concentration of SHH induces the most ventral fate in the neural tube, the floor plate (Principle 2). In the adjacent paraxial mesoderm (somites), high SHH concentration induces the ventromedial portion to become sclerotome (Principle 3).\n\n2.  **Dorsalizing Signals**: The overlying surface ectoderm and the subsequently formed roof plate of the neural tube secrete dorsalizing signals, including BMPs and WNTs (Principle 4). These form a dorsal-to-ventral gradient. These signals specify dorsal fates in the neural tube (e.g., roof plate, dorsal interneurons) and contribute to the patterning of the dorsolateral part of the somite, the dermomyotome.\n\nThe experimental manipulation introduces a second source of SHH. The graft is located on the right side, between the neural tube and the right somite. This ectopic notochord will function according to Principle 1, secreting its own SHH. The consequences must be analyzed for the neural tube and the adjacent somite based on the principle of local action of morphogens.\n\n*   **Effect on the Neural Tube**: The endogenous notochord maintains its position and continues to secrete SHH, thus sustaining the original floor plate at the ventral midline. The grafted notochord, adjacent to the right lateral wall of the neural tube, creates a new, local high-concentration source of SHH. According to Principle 2, the neural tube cells in this region are competent to respond to high SHH levels. Therefore, an additional, ectopic floor plate will be induced on the right lateral wall of the neural tube. This is a classic result from such transplantation experiments.\n\n*   **Effect on the Somites**: The graft is positioned between the neural tube and the right paraxial mesoderm. The right somite is therefore directly adjacent to this new SHH source. According to Principle 3, paraxial mesoderm responds to SHH by adopting a sclerotome fate. The ectopic SHH will thus act on the adjacent right somite to induce sclerotome formation. This happens at the expense of the dermomyotome fate, meaning the region of the somite specified as sclerotome would be enlarged or reinforced, while the dermomyotome territory would be reduced. The left somite would be largely unaffected by the graft, as the neural tube and endogenous notochord lie between it and the new SHH source, shielding it from direct high-concentration signal.\n\n**Summary of Predicted Outcome**:\n1.  The original floor plate at the ventral midline of the neural tube persists.\n2.  An ectopic floor plate is induced in the right lateral wall of the neural tube.\n3.  Sclerotome is induced in the adjacent right paraxial mesoderm at the expense of dermomyotome.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. The ectopic notochord emits Sonic hedgehog (SHH) that induces sclerotome on each side of the graft with concurrent suppression of dermomyotome, and it induces an additional floor plate along the lateral wall of the neural tube adjacent to the graft while the native midline floor plate remains.**\n\n    This option aligns well with the derived predictions. The term \"on each side of the graft\" is slightly imprecise. The graft lies between the neural tube and the right somite. The SHH signal acts on both: it induces a floor plate in the neural tube (one side) and sclerotome in the paraxial mesoderm (the other side). The statement correctly identifies that SHH induces sclerotome and suppresses dermomyotome, as stated in Principle 3. Critically, it correctly predicts the induction of an additional, ectopic floor plate adjacent to the graft and the persistence of the native midline floor plate. This is the most complete and accurate description of the expected outcome. **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. Excess Sonic hedgehog (SHH) uniformly ventralizes the entire neural tube such that the original floor plate is lost and no ectopic floor plate forms, while somites on both sides revert to dermomyotome because Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) antagonism is overwhelmed.**\n\n    This option is incorrect for multiple reasons. First, morphogens act in gradients, not uniformly; two sources would create a complex gradient, not a uniform field. Second, losing the original floor plate is illogical as its inducing source (endogenous notochord) is still present. Third, stating that no ectopic floor plate forms violates Principle 2. Fourth, the effect on somites is reversed; high SHH induces sclerotome, not dermomyotome. The reasoning about BMP antagonism is also nonsensical in this context. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. The ectopic notochord primarily elevates Wingless-related integration site (WNT) signaling, expanding roof plate and dorsal interneurons, eliminating sclerotome, and duplicating the roof plate rather than the floor plate.**\n\n    This option is fundamentally flawed. It misidentifies the primary signal from the notochord. Principle 1 explicitly states the notochord secretes the ventralizing signal SHH, not the dorsalizing signal WNT. Consequently, all predicted outcomes (expansion of dorsal structures like the roof plate, elimination of the ventral structure sclerotome) are the opposite of what would occur. An ectopic source of a ventralizing signal should duplicate ventral structures (floor plate), not dorsal ones (roof plate). **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. The duplicated notochord produces Sonic hedgehog (SHH) that cannot act locally and therefore induces changes only on the side opposite the graft, producing an ectopic floor plate contralateral to the graft and leaving the somites adjacent to the graft unchanged.**\n\n    This option contradicts the fundamental nature of morphogens, which act locally in a concentration-dependent manner. The premise that SHH \"cannot act locally\" is false. The signal's effects are strongest on the most proximal tissues. Predicting an effect only on the contralateral side while the adjacent tissues remain unchanged is physically and biologically implausible. The tissues immediately next to the graft (right neural tube wall, right somite) would experience the highest signal concentration and be the most affected. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4893638"}]}
