It presents a simplified but coherent biophysical model of embryonic folding, formalizable with standard geometric principles. All necessary parameters are provided, and there are no internal contradictions. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities based on the geometric modeling of embryonic folding: the length of the primitive gut tube segment and the diameter of the resulting vitelline duct. The core principle is the conservation of length of the \"inextensible epithelial sheet\" representing the yolk sac wall.\n\nFirst, we analyze the initial state. The pre-folding yolk sac is modeled as a perfect circle with a given radius, $r$.\nThe radius is $r = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\nThe total circumference of this initial circle, $C_{\\text{total}}$, is given by the formula for the circumference of a circle:\n$$C_{\\text{total}} = 2\\pi r$$\nSubstituting the given value of $r$:\n$$C_{\\text{total}} = 2\\pi(1.0) = 2\\pi\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nThe first quantity to compute is the length of the primitive gut tube segment, which we denote as $L_{\\text{gut}}$. The problem states that this segment is formed from an incorporated arc of the yolk sac wall. The length of this segment is therefore equal to the length of that arc. The formula for the length of a circular arc, $L_{\\text{arc}}$, is:\n$$L_{\\text{arc}} = r \\alpha$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the central angle subtended by the arc, expressed in radians.\n\nThe problem provides the central angle as $\\theta = 120^{\\circ}$. To use the arc length formula, this angle must be converted from degrees to radians. The conversion formula is:\n$$\\alpha_{\\text{rad}} = \\theta_{\\text{deg}} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180}$$\nSubstituting the value of $\\theta$:\n$$\\alpha = 120 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180} = \\frac{12}{18}\\pi = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi\\,\\text{radians}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the length of the incorporated arc, which is $L_{\\text{gut}}$:\n$$L_{\\text{gut}} = r \\alpha = (1.0) \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nThis is the first required value.\n\nThe second quantity to compute is the final diameter of the vitelline duct ring. The problem states that this ring is formed from the remaining part of the yolk sac wall. The length of this remaining wall, $L_{\\text{rem}}$, is the total circumference of the initial yolk sac minus the length of the arc that was incorporated.\n$$L_{\\text{rem}} = C_{\\text{total}} - L_{\\text{gut}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$L_{\\text{rem}} = 2\\pi - \\frac{2\\pi}{3} = \\frac{6\\pi}{3} - \\frac{2\\pi}{3} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nThis remaining length, $L_{\\text{rem}}$, forms the circumference of the new circular ring, the vitelline duct. Let us denote the circumference of the vitelline duct as $C_{\\text{duct}}$ and its diameter as $d_{\\text{duct}}$.\n$$C_{\\text{duct}} = L_{\\text{rem}} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nThe relationship between the circumference and diameter of a circle is:\n$$C_{\\text{duct}} = \\pi d_{\\text{duct}}$$\nWe can solve for the diameter, $d_{\\text{duct}}$:\n$$d_{\\text{duct}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{duct}}}{\\pi}$$\nSubstituting the value of $C_{\\text{duct}}$:\n$$d_{\\text{duct}} = \\frac{4\\pi/3}{\\pi} = \\frac{4}{3}\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nThis is the second required value.\n\nThe two computed values, as exact expressions, are:\n1.

Assume a simplified constitutive link between actomyosin motor activity and tissue-scale line tension based on the following well-tested observations: (i) apical constriction is powered by non-muscle myosin II cross-bridge cycling consuming adenosine triphosphate (ATP), (ii) in the near-linear regime of modest pharmacological perturbation, the macroscopic line tension scales proportionally with the fraction of active myosin motors, and (iii) closure progresses only if the instantaneous line tension exceeds a minimal threshold set by tissue bending stiffness and opposing viscous drag.\n\nLet the baseline seam line tension (force per unit length) be $T_{0} = 1.2$ mN/m.

We can express this relationship mathematically. Let $N$ be the number of active myosin motors. The proportionality is then written as:\n$$\nT \\propto N \\quad \\text{or} \\quad T = k N\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nThe problem defines a baseline state with a line tension $T_{0}$ corresponding to a baseline number of active motors, let's call it $N_{0}$. Thus, we have:\n$$\nT_{0} = k N_{0}\n$$\nThe given value for the baseline tension is $T_{0} = 1.2 \\text{ mN/m}$.\n\nNext, a myosin II inhibitor is applied, which reduces the fraction of active motors to $f$ of the baseline. The new number of active motors, $N_{\\mathrm{res}}$, is therefore:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{res}} = f N_{0}\n$$\nThe problem states this fraction is $f = 0.5$.\n\nThe resulting residual line tension, $T_{\\mathrm{res}}$, will be proportional to this new number of active motors:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{res}} = k N_{\\mathrm{res}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $N_{\\mathrm{res}}$, we get:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{res}} = k (f N_{0}) = f (k N_{0})\n$$\nSince we know that $T_{0} = k N_{0}$, we can substitute this into the equation for $T_{\\mathrm{res}}$:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{res}} = f T_{0}\n$$\nThis equation provides the direct relationship between the residual tension, the baseline tension, and the fraction of remaining active motors.\n\nNow, we can compute the numerical value for $T_{\\mathrm{res}}$ using the given values $T_{0} = 1.2 \\text{ mN/m}$ and $f = 0.5$:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{res}} = 0.5 \\times 1.2 \\text{ mN/m} = 0.6 \\text{ mN/m}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of $T_{\\mathrm{res}}$, which is $0.6 \\text{ mN/m}$.\n\nThe final part of the task is to determine if embryonic closure would proceed or fail. The criterion for this is provided: closure progresses only if the instantaneous line tension exceeds the minimal threshold, $T_{\\min}$. Conversely, closure fails if the tension is less than or equal to this threshold. The condition for failure is:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{res}} \\le T_{\\min}\n$$\nThe problem provides the minimal required tension as $T_{\\min} = 0.7 \\text{ mN/m}$.\n\nWe compare our calculated residual tension to this threshold:\n$$\n0.6 \\text{ mN/m} \\le 0.7 \\text{ mN/m}\n$$\nThe inequality holds true. Since the residual tension $T_{\\mathrm{res}}$ does not exceed the minimal threshold $T_{\\min}$, the mechanical forces are insufficient to overcome the tissue's resistive properties (bending stiffness and viscous drag).

It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective problem based on a simplified kinematic model of embryonic folding.

At its center is a non-adhesive zone of width $w_{\\mathrm{NA}}$. The geometry is symmetric about the midline. The total width of the two lateral regions where migration occurs before reaching the non-adhesive zone is the total width minus the non-adhesive width, which is $W - w_{\\mathrm{NA}}$.\n\nDue to symmetry, each of the two lateral ectodermal edges must migrate a distance $d_{\\mathrm{c}}$ to reach the boundary of the central non-adhesive zone.

The rate of overlap formation is constant because the migration speed $v$ is constant.\n\nLet's consider the width of the overlap region, $w_{\\mathrm{O}}$. The left edge moves to the right at speed $v$, and the right edge moves to the left at speed $v$. The rate at which the width of the overlapping region increases is the relative speed of the two edges, which is the sum of their individual speeds:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{relative}} = v - (-v) = 2v$$\nThis is the rate of change of the overlap width, $\\frac{dw_{\\mathrm{O}}}{dt}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the rate of new overlap area formation, $R_{\\mathrm{A}}$, for a unit cranio-caudal segment of length $L = 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The area of the overlap, $A_{\\mathrm{O}}$, is the product of its width $w_{\\mathrm{O}}$ and the segment length $L_s$:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{O}}(t) = w_{\\mathrm{O}}(t) \\cdot L$$\nThe problem uses the symbol $L$ for the length, so we will use that. Here, $L = 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nThe rate of area formation $R_{\\mathrm{A}}$ is the time derivative of the area $A_{\\mathrm{O}}$ for any time $t  t_{\\mathrm{c}}$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{dA_{\\mathrm{O}}}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(w_{\\mathrm{O}}(t) \\cdot L)$$\nSince $L$ is a constant, we have:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{A}} = L \\cdot \\frac{dw_{\\mathrm{O}}}{dt}$$\nAs established, the rate of change of the overlap width is $\\frac{dw_{\\mathrm{O}}}{dt} = 2v$.
