This is a classic geometric packing problem.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the radius of the blastomeres, $r$, and the inner radius of the Zona Pellucida, $R$. Based on the volume conservation principle (assumptions i and ii), the total volume of the $N=16$ cells must equal the volume of the sphere defined by the ZP's inner boundary.\n$$N \\cdot \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\right) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$$\n$$16 r^3 = R^3$$\nTaking the cube root of both sides gives the relationship between $R$ and $r$:\n$$R = (16)^{1/3} r = (2^4)^{1/3} r = 2^{4/3} r$$\n\nNext, we consider the geometry of the outer cells. An outer cell is tangent to the inner surface of the ZP. This means the distance from the center of the ZP (which we take as the origin) to the center of an outer cell is $R-r$. The problem defines this distance as $\\rho$.\n$$\\rho = R - r = (2^{4/3} - 1)r$$\nAll outer cell centers lie on the surface of a sphere of radius $\\rho$.\n\nThe constraint that two outer cells cannot overlap implies their surfaces cannot intersect. Since they are identical spheres of radius $r$, the minimum distance between the centers of any two outer cells is $2r$.\n\nLet us consider two outer cell centers, $C_1$ and $C_2$, positioned at this minimum separation distance, $d = |C_1 C_2| = 2r$. Let $O$ be the center of the ZP. The points $O$, $C_1$, and $C_2$ form an isosceles triangle with side lengths $|OC_1| = \\rho$, $|OC_2| = \\rho$, and $|C_1 C_2| = 2r$.\n\nThe problem suggests modeling the packing limit by considering the non-overlapping spherical caps excluded by each outer cell. The \"angular radius\" $\\beta$ of such a cap corresponds to the angle subtended at the center $O$ by the radius of the `footprint` of a cell on the sphere of radius $\\rho$. Let's bisect the triangle $\\triangle OC_1 C_2$ with a line from $O$ to the midpoint of the segment $C_1 C_2$. This forms two right-angled triangles, each with hypotenuse $\\rho$, one leg of length $r$, and the angle at $O$ being $\\beta$. The angle $\\beta$ must satisfy:\n$$\\sin(\\beta) = \\frac{r}{\\rho}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\rho$:\n$$\\sin(\\beta) = \\frac{r}{(2^{4/3} - 1)r} = \\frac{1}{2^{4/3} - 1}$$\n\nThe problem asks for an upper bound on $M$, the number of outer cells, based on the area of these spherical caps. The surface area of the sphere of radius $\\rho$ is $A_{\\text{sphere}} = 4\\pi\\rho^2$. The surface area of a single spherical cap of angular radius $\\beta$ is $A_{\\text{cap}} = 2\\pi\\rho^2(1 - \\cos\\beta)$.\n\nAn upper bound for $M$ is the ratio of the total available surface area to the area of one cap.

These are the cells that do not contact the ZP. The total number of cells is $N=16$.\n$$N_{\\text{inner}} = N - M = 16 - 8 = 8$$\nThus, in this idealized model, the $16$-cell embryo would consist of $8$ outer cells and $8$ inner cells.
