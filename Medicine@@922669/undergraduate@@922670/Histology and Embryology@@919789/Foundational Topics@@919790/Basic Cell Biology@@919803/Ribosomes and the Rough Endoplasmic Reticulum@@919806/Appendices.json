In eukaryotic translation, the process is classically partitioned into initiation, elongation, and termination, consistent with the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, where polypeptides are built by adding amino acids one at a time to a growing chain. Consider the following well-established event costs during eukaryotic translation at the RER:\n- Initiation requires guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis by eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), counted as $1$ GTP per initiation event.\n- Each elongation cycle that adds one amino acid requires $1$ GTP for delivery of aminoacyl-tRNA by eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), and $1$ GTP for ribosomal translocation mediated by eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2).\n- Each amino acid added to the polypeptide requires charging of its cognate tRNA by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, counted as $1$ adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per amino acid.\n- Termination requires $1$ GTP for release factor activity.\n\nStarting from these fundamental steps and counts, and using the principle that a polypeptide of length $n$ amino acids undergoes $n-1$ elongation cycles (because the first amino acid is placed during initiation), derive the total GTP and ATP molecules hydrolyzed as functions of $n$, and then evaluate these totals for a secreted protein of length $n = 400$ amino acids synthesized on the RER.

The hydrolysis of GTP occurs during three distinct stages of translation: initiation, elongation, and termination. We will sum the costs for each stage.\n\n1.  **Initiation:** The problem states that the initiation of translation for one polypeptide chain requires the hydrolysis of $1$ GTP molecule by eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2).\n    $$GTP_{\\text{initiation}} = 1$$\n\n2.  **Elongation:** The problem specifies that a polypeptide of length $n$ amino acids requires $n-1$ elongation cycles. Each elongation cycle has two steps involving GTP hydrolysis:\n    -   Delivery of an aminoacyl-tRNA by eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), costing $1$ GTP.\n    -   Translocation of the ribosome along the messenger RNA, mediated by eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), costing $1$ GTP.\n    Therefore, the cost per elongation cycle is $1 + 1 = 2$ GTP molecules.

This practice challenges you to step into the role of a cell biologist and design a definitive experiment to find out. Using classic biochemical tools like high-salt washes and the drug puromycin, you will learn to distinguish between competing hypotheses about how ribosomes are tethered to the translocon, a core skill in scientific investigation [@problem_id:4927132].", "problem": "A cell homogenate is fractionated to isolate vesicular fragments of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), commonly termed rough microsomes, by differential centrifugation. You are asked to design an experiment using ionic strength manipulation to test whether ribosomes are retained on the RER primarily via their nascent polypeptide chains engaging the Sec61 translocon (a protein-conducting channel) rather than through stable ribosome–membrane protein anchors independent of the nascent chain. Your design must include how fractions will be separated and what outcome you predict if nascent-chain engagement is the dominant mechanism.\n\nAs a fundamental base, consider the Central Dogma of molecular biology and the well-established facts that (i) co-translational translocation targets signal sequence–bearing nascent chains to the RER via the signal recognition particle (SRP) and the SRP receptor, after which the ribosome docks on the Sec61 translocon while the elongating polypeptide traverses the channel; (ii) high ionic strength buffers weaken electrostatic protein–protein interactions but do not break covalent bonds; (iii) puromycin is an aminoacyl-tRNA analog that enters the ribosomal A site, accepts the nascent chain, and causes premature chain release from the ribosome; and (iv) ribosome integrity requires divalent cations such as magnesium ions $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$.\n\nChoose the most appropriate protocol and predicted outcome among the following options:\n\nA. Isolate rough microsomes and wash with high-salt buffer (e.g., $500\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ potassium chloride) at $4\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$, then perform ultracentrifugation at $100{,}000\\times g$ for $60\\,\\mathrm{min}$ to separate pellet (microsomes) from supernatant.

Quantify ribosomes in pellet versus supernatant (e.g., by measuring $28\\mathrm{S}$/$18\\mathrm{S}$ rRNA or ribosomal protein markers), and assess nascent chain topology by protease protection.

Predict that if ribosomes are attached via nascent chains, RNase will have no effect on attachment and only protease will release ribosomes, demonstrating stable protein–protein anchors.\n\nD.

Predict that integral membrane proteins and ribosomes are released to the supernatant if ribosomes are not stably anchored, confirming nascent-chain dependent attachment.", "solution": "We begin from first principles relevant to ribosome–RER engagement:\n\n1. The Central Dogma states that information flows from DNA to RNA to protein. During translation, ribosomes synthesize polypeptides. For secretory and membrane proteins, co-translational translocation routes ribosome–nascent chain complexes to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER): a signal sequence in the nascent chain is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP), which targets the complex to the SRP receptor; the ribosome then docks on the Sec61 translocon, and the nascent polypeptide traverses the channel into or across the membrane.\n\n2. High ionic strength buffers (e.g., $500\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ potassium chloride) weaken electrostatic protein–protein interactions by screening charges; they are widely used to strip peripheral proteins from membranes but do not break covalent bonds or disrupt structures maintained primarily by the presence of a polypeptide threaded through a transmembrane pore.\n\n3. Puromycin is an aminoacyl-tRNA analog that occupies the ribosomal A site and forms a peptide bond with the nascent chain in the P site, causing premature termination. Crucially, puromycin transfers the nascent chain from the ribosome to puromycin, thereby releasing the chain from the ribosome; for a translocating nascent chain, this disrupts the tether connecting the ribosome to the Sec61 channel.\n\n4. Ribosome integrity depends on divalent cations such as $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$. Chelation by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) can dissociate ribosomal subunits, a non-specific effect on ribosome structure independent of RER docking mechanisms.\n\nTo test whether ribosome retention on the RER is predominantly via nascent-chain engagement, the critical logic is:\n\n- If retention is via a stable ribosome–membrane protein anchor independent of the nascent chain, then high salt should be sufficient to disrupt electrostatic interactions and release ribosomes from the membrane. Thus, a high-salt wash would shift ribosomes to the supernatant upon ultracentrifugation.\n\n- If retention is via the nascent chain passing through Sec61, then the key tether is the physical presence of the growing polypeptide in the translocon; high salt alone will not eliminate this tether. In that case, high salt should not release ribosomes. However, addition of puromycin, which releases the nascent chain from the ribosome, should break the tether and cause ribosome detachment. Ultracentrifugation would then show ribosomes in the supernatant.\n\n- EDTA and RNase introduce confounds. EDTA releases ribosomes by destabilizing ribosome structure via $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ chelation, irrespective of attachment mechanism, and RNase degrades mRNA, which will halt translation and can lead to ribosome run-off independent of salt tolerance; these do not specifically distinguish nascent-chain tethering versus stable anchors. High-pH sodium carbonate extraction targets peripheral and some tightly associated membrane proteins but is not specific to the nascent chain mechanism and can extract integral membrane proteins under harsh conditions, confounding interpretation.\n\nNow, option-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Protocol: high-salt wash alone, then ultracentrifugation. Prediction: most ribosomes move to the supernatant. This prediction assumes ribosome retention is via weak electrostatic anchors and dismisses the nascent-chain tether. Given the fundamental base, if nascent-chain engagement is dominant, high salt alone should not release ribosomes because the tether is the polypeptide in Sec61. Therefore, the prediction in A contradicts the hypothesis-driven expectation. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nB. Protocol: high-salt wash with parallel samples $\\pm$ puromycin, followed by ultracentrifugation and quantification of ribosomes in pellet versus supernatant; protease protection to assess nascent chain topology. Prediction: salt alone leaves ribosomes with the microsome pellet; salt plus puromycin shifts ribosomes to the supernatant; protease protection confirms luminal segments of puromycylated nascent chains. This directly targets the nascent-chain tether: puromycin releases the chain, causing ribosome detachment; high salt alone tests whether weak electrostatic anchors suffice to retain ribosomes. The predicted outcome matches expectations if nascent-chain engagement is dominant. The protease protection assay provides mechanistic confirmation that nascent chains had entered the lumen. Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. Protocol: RNase before high-salt wash, then ultracentrifugation. Prediction: RNase has no effect and only protease releases ribosomes. This misstates the role of mRNA and nascent chains: RNase can degrade mRNA, halt translation, and cause ribosome run-off even without protease, and it does not uniquely distinguish nascent-chain tethering from stable anchors. Moreover, claiming only protease would release ribosomes is inconsistent with the nascent-chain mechanism, where puromycin is sufficient. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. Protocol: EDTA plus high-salt, then ultracentrifugation. Prediction: ribosomal subunits dissociate and move to the supernatant, demonstrating nascent-chain engagement. EDTA chelates $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ and dissociates ribosomes regardless of attachment mechanism, making the result non-informative for the specific hypothesis; release due to ribosome destabilization does not demonstrate nascent-chain dependence. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. Protocol: high-pH sodium carbonate extraction plus high salt, then ultracentrifugation. Prediction: integral membrane proteins and ribosomes are released to the supernatant, confirming nascent-chain dependent attachment. High-pH carbonate extraction is a harsh treatment that can extract peripheral and some tightly associated proteins and perturb membranes; releasing integral membrane proteins under these conditions confounds interpretation and does not specifically test nascent-chain tethering. The prediction is not mechanistically diagnostic.

Type I proteins have cytosolic N-termini and insert via internal signal-anchors; type II proteins have lumenal N-termini produced by a cleavable signal peptide; type III proteins are multi-pass with two anchors.

Orientation is determined primarily by the positive-inside rule (lysine/arginine enrichment on the cytosolic side) and by whether a cleavable N-terminal signal peptide is present; signal peptidase cleaves only N-terminal signal peptides, not internal anchors; SRP can engage either N-terminal signal peptides or internal signal-anchors.

This is also achieved with a single internal signal-anchor. The orientation is dictated by the \"positive-inside rule\": a cluster of positively charged amino acids on the C-terminal side of the anchor sequence keeps this flank in the cytosol, causing the N-terminus to be translocated into the lumen.\n*   **N-linked Glycosylation:** This modification occurs only on polypeptide segments exposed to the ER lumen, serving as an experimental marker for lumenal localization.\n\n**Analysis of Constructs:**\n*   **Construct $\\alpha$:** It has a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence and a downstream stop-transfer segment. The N-terminal signal initiates translocation. The glycosylation of the N-terminus confirms it entered the ER lumen. The stop-transfer segment anchors the protein in the membrane, leaving the C-terminus in the cytosol. This is the definition of a **Type I** membrane protein.\n*   **Construct $\\beta$:** It has a single internal signal-anchor. The positive charges are N-terminal to this anchor. By the positive-inside rule, the N-terminal region remains in the cytosol. The anchor segment inserts into the membrane, and the rest of the polypeptide (the C-terminal portion) is translocated into the lumen. The glycosylation of the C-terminus confirms its lumenal location. This topology (N-terminus cytosolic, C-terminus lumenal) is the definition of a **Type II** membrane protein.\n*   **Construct $\\gamma$:** It has a single internal signal-anchor. The positive charges are C-terminal to this anchor. By the positive-inside rule, the C-terminal region remains in the cytosol. This forces the N-terminal region to be translocated across the membrane into the lumen. The glycosylation of the N-terminus confirms its lumenal location.
