The derivation begins with the definition of the electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}$, for an ionic species.\n\nThe electrochemical potential of an ion is the sum of its chemical potential and the electrical potential energy per mole.

For such a channel, the steady-state current, $I$, is directly proportional to the electrochemical driving force, which is the difference between the membrane potential, $V_m$, and the ion's reversal potential, $E_K$. This relationship is a form of Ohm's Law:\n$$I = g(V_m - E_K)$$\nwhere $g$ is the single-channel conductance. This equation can be rewritten in the form of a linear equation, $y = mx + c$:\n$$I = gV_m - gE_K$$\nHere, $I$ is the dependent variable ($y$), $V_m$ is the independent variable ($x$), the slope $m$ is the conductance $g$, and the y-intercept $c$ is $-gE_K$.

The underlying principles—osmosis, the role of the $\\text{Na}^+/\\text{K}^+$ pump in maintaining cell volume, and the effect of its inhibition—are scientifically sound. The provided numerical values for osmolarity ($300$ mOsm/L), the change in osmolyte content ($60$ mOsm/L), and cell radius ($6.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}$) are within physiologically plausible ranges.\n\nThe problem requires a solution based on the van 't Hoff relation, which equates osmotic pressures for osmotic equilibrium. For a semipermeable membrane allowing free passage of water but not solutes, equilibrium is reached when the total osmolarity of solutes is equal on both sides: $\\Pi_{in} = \\Pi_{out} \\implies C_{int} = C_{out}$. The problem statement directs us to find the new radius \"after osmotic equilibration\", implying a stable final state where water flux is zero. This necessitates that the final intracellular osmolarity, $C_{int,f}$, equals the constant extracellular osmolarity, $C_{ext}$.\n\nA rigorous biophysical analysis would involve a Donnan equilibrium for the permeant ions ($\\text{Na}^{+}$, $\\text{K}^{+}$, $\\text{Cl}^{-}$) in the presence of impermeant intracellular macromolecules. Such an equilibrium results in a final state where $C_{int,f} > C_{ext}$, leading to a persistent osmotic pressure gradient that would cause continuous swelling and eventual lysis, not a stable equilibrium volume (unless balanced by significant hydrostatic pressure, which is ruled out).\n\nHowever, the problem is structured as a simplified, self-contained physics problem. The phrase \"net intracellular accumulation\" and the specification that these new solutes are \"effectively trapped during the equilibration timescale\" suggest a two-step process:\n1. A slow process of ion redistribution leading to a net gain of a specific quantity of intracellular solutes.\n2. A rapid process of water movement to a new equilibrium, during which all intracellular solutes (both original and newly accumulated) are considered trapped.\n\nThis interpretation is consistent with the directive to use first principles to find a new equilibrium radius and bypasses the complexities of Donnan equilibrium. It frames the problem in a way that is well-posed and solvable with the given information. The problem is therefore deemed valid within this intended simplified physical model.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. Proceeding to solution.\n\n## DERIVATION OF THE SOLUTION\n\nThe problem can be solved by applying the principle of conservation of mass for the intracellular solutes during the process of water equilibration, followed by the application of the osmotic equilibrium condition.\n\n1.  **Initial State**:\n    The cell is initially a sphere of radius $r_0 = 6.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}$. Its initial volume is $V_0 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_0^3$.\n    The initial intracellular osmolarity is $C_{int,0} = 300$ mOsm/L.\n    The total number of osmoles (osmotically active particles) inside the cell is $N_0 = C_{int,0} \\cdot V_0$.\n\n2.  **Solute Accumulation**:\n    Following the inhibition of the $\\text{Na}^+/\\text{K}^+$-ATPase, ion leaks lead to a *net* accumulation of solutes. This implies that fluxes like $\\text{K}^{+}$ efflux have been accounted for in the stated net change.\n    The accumulation is given as being \"equivalent to $\\Delta C_{\\text{osm}} = 60$ mOsm/L of NaCl\". The most direct interpretation is that the *amount* of solute added, $\\Delta N$, is equal to this concentration multiplied by the initial cell volume, $V_0$.\n    $$ \\Delta N = \\Delta C_{\\text{osm}} \\cdot V_0 = (60 \\text{ mOsm/L}) \\cdot V_0 $$\n    After this accumulation, but before any water has moved, the total number of osmoles inside the cell becomes $N_f$.\n    $$ N_f = N_0 + \\Delta N = C_{int,0} \\cdot V_0 + \\Delta C_{\\text{osm}} \\cdot V_0 = (C_{int,0} + \\Delta C_{\\text{osm}}) \\cdot V_0 $$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$ N_f = (300 \\text{ mOsm/L} + 60 \\text{ mOsm/L}) \\cdot V_0 = (360 \\text{ mOsm/L}) \\cdot V_0 $$\n    During the subsequent rapid water equilibration, this total number of solutes $N_f$ is conserved inside the cell.\n\n3.  **Final State**:\n    Water enters the cell, increasing its volume to a final volume $V_f$ and its radius to $r_f$. This continues until osmotic equilibrium is re-established.\n    The equilibrium condition is that the final intracellular osmolarity, $C_{int,f}$, must equal the constant extracellular osmolarity, $C_{ext} = 300$ mOsm/L.\n    $$ C_{int,f} = C_{ext} = 300 \\text{ mOsm/L} $$\n    The final intracellular osmolarity is also defined as the total final osmoles divided by the final volume:\n    $$ C_{int,f} = \\frac{N_f}{V_f} $$\n    Equating the two expressions for $C_{int,f}$:\n    $$ \\frac{N_f}{V_f} = 300 \\text{ mOsm/L} $$\n    Substituting the expression for $N_f$:\n    $$ \\frac{(360 \\text{ mOsm/L}) \\cdot V_0}{V_f} = 300 \\text{ mOsm/L} $$\n\n4.  **Calculate Final Radius**:\n    We can now solve for the ratio of the final volume to the initial volume:\n    $$ \\frac{V_f}{V_0} = \\frac{360 \\text{ mOsm/L}}{300 \\text{ mOsm/L}} = \\frac{36}{30} = 1.2 $$\n    The cell is a sphere, so its volume $V$ is related to its radius $r$ by $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$. The ratio of volumes is therefore related to the ratio of radii:\n    $$ \\frac{V_f}{V_0} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_f^3}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_0^3} = \\left(\\frac{r_f}{r_0}\\right)^3 $$\n    Combining the results:\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{r_f}{r_0}\\right)^3 = 1.2 $$\n    $$ r_f = r_0 \\cdot (1.2)^{1/3} $$\n    Substituting the initial radius $r_0 = 6.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}$:\n    $$ r_f = 6.0\\,\\mu\\text{m} \\cdot (1.2)^{1/3} $$\n    Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n    $$ (1.2)^{1/3} \\approx 1.062658... $$\n    $$ r_f \\approx 6.0 \\cdot 1.062658... \\,\\mu\\text{m} \\approx 6.37595... \\,\\mu\\text{m} $$\n    Rounding to two significant figures (consistent with $6.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}$) gives $r_f \\approx 6.4\\,\\mu\\text{m}$. However, we must evaluate the provided options.\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n-   **A. $r_f \\approx 6.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}$**: This would imply no change in volume. This is incorrect, as the net influx of solutes will cause water to enter the cell, leading to swelling. The radius must increase. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **B. $r_f \\approx 6.9\\,\\mu\\text{m}$**: To obtain this radius, the volume ratio would need to be $V_f/V_0 = (6.9/6.0)^3 = (1.15)^3 \\approx 1.52$. This would correspond to a solute accumulation of $\\Delta C_{\\text{osm}} = 300 \\cdot (1.52 - 1) = 156$ mOsm/L, which is far from the given $60$ mOsm/L. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **C. $r_f \\approx 6.3\\,\\mu\\text{m}$**: Our calculated radius is $r_f \\approx 6.38\\,\\mu\\text{m}$. This option is numerically the closest to our derived value. The difference is $|6.38 - 6.30| = 0.08\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, which is a relative difference of about $1.3\\%$. While not exact, it is the most plausible answer among the choices. The discrepancy may arise from minor rounding in the problem's design or a slight variation in the intended model, but based on a direct interpretation, this is the best fit. **Correct**.\n\n-   **D. $r_f \\approx 7.2\\,\\mu\\text{m}$**: To obtain this radius, the volume ratio would need to be $V_f/V_0 = (7.2/6.0)^3 = (1.2)^3 = 1.728$. This corresponds to a solute accumulation of $\\Delta C_{\\text{osm}} = 300 \\cdot (1.728 - 1) = 218.4$ mOsm/L. This is substantially different from the stated $60$ mOsm/L. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4938687"}]}
