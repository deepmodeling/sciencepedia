In a well-mixed in vitro system containing Globular actin (G-actin), the instantaneous polymerization rate at an end is proportional to the free G-actin concentration, and depolymerization is concentration-independent. Use the following foundational definitions:\n\n- The polymerization rate at an end is $r_{\\text{on}} = k_{\\text{on}}[\\text{A}]$, where $k_{\\text{on}}$ is the second-order association rate constant and $[\\text{A}]$ is the free G-actin concentration.\n- The depolymerization rate at an end is $r_{\\text{off}} = k_{\\text{off}}$, where $k_{\\text{off}}$ is the first-order dissociation rate constant.\n- The net endwise velocity (in subunits per second) at the barbed (plus) end is $v^{+} = r_{\\text{on}}^{+} - r_{\\text{off}}^{+}$, and at the pointed (minus) end is $v^{-} = r_{\\text{on}}^{-} - r_{\\text{off}}^{-}$.\n- The critical concentration at an end is $C_{\\text{c}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}}$ and indicates the threshold of $[\\text{A}]$ at which net growth at that end is zero.\n\nA single actin filament is placed into a solution with $[\\text{G-actin}] = [\\text{A}] = 1\\,\\mu\\text{M}$.

The provided kinetic parameters are within the range of experimentally measured values. The problem is well-posed, as all necessary definitions and constants are provided to calculate the required quantities.

The problem is objective and formalizable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be computed.\n\nThe problem requires determining if treadmilling occurs for a single actin filament at a specified free G-actin concentration of $[\\text{A}] = 1\\,\\mu\\text{M}$. The condition for treadmilling is explicitly defined as the state where the barbed (plus) end grows ($v^{+} > 0$) while the pointed (minus) end shrinks ($v^{-} < 0$).\n\nFirst, we calculate the net velocity of subunit addition or loss at the barbed end, $v^{+}$, using the provided definition and parameters:\n$$\nv^{+} = k_{\\text{on}}^{+}[\\text{A}] - k_{\\text{off}}^{+}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nv^{+} = (11\\,\\mu\\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1})(1\\,\\mu\\text{M}) - 1.4\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nv^{+} = 11\\,\\text{s}^{-1} - 1.4\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = 9.6\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nSince $v^{+} = 9.6\\,\\text{s}^{-1} > 0$, the barbed end is experiencing net polymerization, or growth.\n\nNext, we calculate the net velocity at the pointed end, $v^{-}$, using the corresponding definition and parameters:\n$$\nv^{-} = k_{\\text{on}}^{-}[\\text{A}] - k_{\\text{off}}^{-}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nv^{-} = (1.3\\,\\mu\\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1})(1\\,\\mu\\text{M}) - 0.8\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nv^{-} = 1.3\\,\\text{s}^{-1} - 0.8\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = 0.5\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nSince $v^{-} = 0.5\\,\\text{s}^{-1} > 0$, the pointed end is also experiencing net polymerization, or growth.\n\nThe condition for treadmilling, $v^{+} > 0$ and $v^{-} < 0$, is not met. We have found that both ends of the filament are growing ($v^{+} > 0$ and $v^{-} > 0$).\n\nThis outcome can also be understood by comparing the free G-actin concentration $[\\text{A}]$ to the critical concentrations at each end, $C_{\\text{c}}^{+}$ and $C_{\\text{c}}^{-}$.\nThe critical concentration for the barbed end is:\n$$\nC_{\\text{c}}^{+} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}^{+}}{k_{\\text{on}}^{+}} = \\frac{1.4\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}{11\\,\\mu\\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}} \\approx 0.127\\,\\mu\\text{M}\n$$\nThe critical concentration for the pointed end is:\n$$\nC_{\\text{c}}^{-} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}^{-}}{k_{\\text{on}}^{-}} = \\frac{0.8\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}{1.3\\,\\mu\\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}} \\approx 0.615\\,\\mu\\text{M}\n$$\nTreadmilling occurs when the free monomer concentration lies between the two critical concentrations, specifically in the range $C_{\\text{c}}^{+} < [\\text{A}] < C_{\\text{c}}^{-}$. In this problem, the concentration $[\\text{A}] = 1\\,\\mu\\text{M}$ is greater than both $C_{\\text{c}}^{+}$ and $C_{\\text{c}}^{-}$. This confirms that there should be net growth at both ends of the filament.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, \"If both ends grow or both ends shrink, take $v_{\\text{tm}} = 0$ and the direction to be 'none'.\" The encoding for 'none' is specified as $0$.\nTherefore, the treadmilling velocity is $v_{\\text{tm}} = 0$ subunits per second, and the direction is $d = 0$.\n\nThe final answer is to be presented as a two-entry row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} v_{\\text{tm}} & d \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSubstituting our results, we get $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4936465"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical models provide a powerful framework, but how do we observe and measure cytoskeletal dynamics in living cells?

The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents standard research goals and correctly associates them with established experimental methods and their underlying physical principles.\n\nThe five goals and their associated techniques/principles are:\n(i) Quantifying actin monomer exchange, based on Fick's laws of diffusion, implies Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP).\n(ii) Visualizing polymerization near the plasma membrane ($\\approx 10^2 \\,\\mathrm{nm}$), based on Snell's law and total internal reflection, implies Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy.\n(iii) Determining high-resolution native architecture of filaments without chemical fixation, based on cryogenic vitrification and electron scattering, implies Cryogenic Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM).\n(iv) Mapping local stiffness and adhesion forces at the pico- to nano-Newton scale, based on Hooke's law for a cantilever, implies Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM).\n(v) Measuring kinesin step sizes and stall forces, based on optical gradient force trapping, implies optical tweezers.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option by systematically analyzing its description of these five techniques.\n\n### Option A\n\n- **Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP):** The description states that FRAP measures \"spatially averaged molecular mobility by bleaching fluorophores in a defined region and tracking recovery driven by lateral diffusion and binding/unbinding\". It correctly identifies that this yields \"diffusion coefficients $D$ and residence times (e.g., off-rates $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$)\" and importantly, \"does not resolve single-molecule steps\". This is an accurate description. FRAP models recovery curves using equations derived from Fick's laws, often including reaction-diffusion terms to account for binding, providing spatially averaged, ensemble-level information about mobility.\n\n- **Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) Microscopy:** The option describes TIRF as using an \"evanescent field generated by total internal reflection\". It correctly specifies that the \"excitation decays approximately exponentially with depth $z$ and is confined to about $10^2 \\,\\mathrm{nm}$\". This confinement near the coverslip-sample interface enables \"high signal-to-noise imaging of events at the cell cortex\", perfectly matching goal (ii). This description is physically correct and accurately represents the application.\n\n- **Cryogenic Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM):** The option states that cryo-EM \"vitrifies samples and images with electrons to reconstruct near-native structures at nanometer to near-atomic resolution (often on the order of a few $\\mathrm{\\AA}$)\". It correctly identifies a key limitation: it provides \"structural snapshots rather than dynamic rates in live cells\". This accurately reflects the technique's principle of flash-freezing to preserve native architecture, avoiding fixation artifacts, and its nature as a structural, not a live-cell dynamic, method. This aligns with goal (iii).\n\n- **Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM):** The description states that AFM \"detects cantilever deflection to measure forces via $F = k_{\\mathrm{c}} \\Delta x$ and map topography and mechanics (e.g., stiffness, adhesion) at $10^{-12}$–$10^{-9} \\,\\mathrm{N}$ scales on cells and filaments\". This correctly invokes Hooke's law for a calibrated cantilever spring constant $k_{\\mathrm{c}}$ and deflection $\\Delta x$. The force range of pico-Newtons ($10^{-12} \\,\\mathrm{N}$) to nano-Newtons ($10^{-9} \\,\\mathrm{N}$) is correct for cellular biophysics. The application to measuring stiffness and adhesion on living cells is also a primary use of AFM. This matches goal (iv).\n\n- **Optical Tweezers:** The option describes optical tweezers as trapping \"dielectric beads... by gradient forces, yielding a near-harmonic potential $U \\approx \\tfrac{1}{2} k x^2$\". It correctly states they \"resolve bead displacements $x$ and forces $F = k x$ to quantify motor step sizes and stall forces in the $1$–$100 \\,\\mathrm{pN}$ range\". Finally, it correctly notes they \"do not image atomic structure\". This is a precise summary of the technique's principle (gradient force trap as a harmonic spring), its application to measuring motor protein mechanics (forces and step sizes), the relevant force scale, and its limitations. This matches goal (v).\n\n**Verdict for Option A: Correct.** All five descriptions are accurate and fully consistent with the established principles and applications of these techniques.\n\n### Option B\n\n- **FRAP:** \"resolves single-molecule step sizes... and provides atomic-resolution localization\". **Incorrect.** FRAP is an ensemble technique with diffraction-limited resolution, incapable of resolving single-molecule steps or achieving atomic resolution.\n- **TIRF:** \"excites fluorophores throughout several $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ into the cytoplasm using a propagating field\". **Incorrect.** TIRF's defining feature is the shallow ($\\approx 100 \\,\\mathrm{nm}$) evanescent field, not a deep propagating field.\n- **Cryo-EM:** \"measures diffusion rates of filaments in live cells under physiological temperatures\". **Incorrect.** Cryo-EM is a static structural technique that requires cryogenic freezing; it does not measure dynamics in live cells at physiological temperatures.\n- **AFM:** \"reconstructs atomic structures of proteins in bulk solution with electron beams\". **Incorrect.** AFM uses a physical probe, not an electron beam, and is a surface technique, not for bulk solution structural determination.\n- **Optical Tweezers:** \"rely solely on radiation pressure and cannot be calibrated to measure forces\". **Incorrect.** The trapping mechanism for small particles is the gradient force, and optical traps are precisely calibrated for force measurements.\n\n**Verdict for Option B: Incorrect.** Every description contains fundamental errors.\n\n### Option C\n\n- **FRAP:** \"measures absolute protein concentration independent of mobility and does not inform on binding kinetics\". **Incorrect.** FRAP measurements are critically dependent on mobility (diffusion and binding) and do not directly yield absolute concentration.\n- **TIRF:** \"requires $1$–$2 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ penetration depth\". **Incorrect.** The penetration depth is $\\approx 100 \\,\\mathrm{nm}$ ($0.1 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$). A depth of $1$–$2 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ would defeat the purpose of surface-selective excitation.\n- **Cryo-EM:** \"depends on chemical fixation and dehydration, thereby precluding near-native architectures\". **Incorrect.** Cryo-EM is defined by its avoidance of chemical fixation and dehydration through cryogenic vitrification, which is precisely why it preserves near-native structures.\n- **AFM:** \"operates at kilo-Newton force scales and cannot probe living cells\". **Incorrect.** The forces are pN-nN, which is $12$ to $15$ orders of magnitude smaller than a kilo-Newton. AFM is one of the most powerful tools for probing living cells.\n- **Optical Tweezers:** \"measure only torques, not linear forces or displacements\". **Incorrect.** The primary and most common application of optical tweezers is the measurement of linear forces and displacements.\n\n**Verdict for Option C: Incorrect.** Every description is factually wrong.\n\n### Option D\n\n- **FRAP:** \"infers cellular temperature from bleach recovery and is insensitive to diffusion\". **Incorrect.** Recovery is entirely dependent on diffusion and mobility; it is not a method for measuring temperature.\n- **TIRF:** \"uses two-photon excitation to generate the evanescent field\". **Incorrect.** Standard TIRF uses single-photon excitation. The evanescent field is a consequence of total internal reflection, not the excitation modality.\n- **Cryo-EM:** \"requires heavy metal staining to achieve nanometer resolution\". **Incorrect.** This describes an older technique (negative staining). Modern high-resolution cryo-EM relies on the intrinsic phase contrast of the unstained, vitrified sample.\n- **AFM:** \"generates topographic images only and cannot be used to measure mechanical properties\". **Incorrect.** Measuring mechanical properties is a core function of AFM, equal in importance to topographic imaging.\n- **Optical Tweezers:** \"provide atomic-resolution imaging of actin filaments in addition to force measurements\". **Incorrect.** Optical tweezers are a manipulation and force-measurement tool, not an atomic-resolution imaging technique. Their resolution is limited by the diffraction of light.\n\n**Verdict for Option D: Incorrect.** Every description contains significant errors.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, Option A is the only one that provides a completely correct description for all five techniques, linking their physical principles to their specific applications in studying the cytoskeleton as outlined in the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4936455"}, {"introduction": "The cytoskeleton's influence extends far beyond the single cell, orchestrating the large-scale shaping of tissues and entire organisms during development.

It can be solved by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{L} = \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)\\,dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial time $t=0$ to a later time $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{L(0)}^{L(t)} \\frac{dL'}{L'} = \\int_{0}^{t} \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t')\\,dt'\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{L(t)}{L(0)}\\right) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t')\\,dt'\n$$\nSolving for $L(t)$ yields:\n$$\nL(t) = L(0) \\exp\\left(\\int_{0}^{t} \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t')\\,dt'\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that the actomyosin-driven intercalation provides an \"approximately steady axial strain rate\".

Thus, the integral simplifies to $\\int_{0}^{t} \\dot{\\varepsilon}\\,dt' = \\dot{\\varepsilon}t$. The expression for the length becomes:\n$$\nL(t) = L(0) \\exp(\\dot{\\varepsilon} t)\n$$\nWe now apply this general solution to the two specified conditions: control and inhibited.\n\n**1.

Inhibited Condition:**\nUnder inhibition, the actomyosin tension is reduced to $T_{\\mathrm{inhib}} = f\\,T$. The corresponding strain rate, $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{inhib}}$, is:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{inhib}} = a\\,r\\,\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{inhib}}}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = a\\,r\\,\\frac{f\\,T}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\n$$\nBy factoring out $f$, we can relate the inhibited strain rate to the control strain rate:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{inhib}} = f \\left( a\\,r\\,\\frac{T}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\right) = f\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{control}}\n$$\nThe length of the axis under inhibited conditions, $L_{\\mathrm{inhib}}(t)$, is therefore:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{inhib}}(t) = L(0) \\exp(\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{inhib}} t) = L(0) \\exp(f\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{control}} t)\n$$\n\n**3. Calculation of the Sensitivity Ratio R:**\nThe problem asks for the dimensionless sensitivity ratio $R$ at time $t = 5\\,\\text{h}$, defined as:\n$$\nR = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{inhib}}(t)}{L_{\\mathrm{control}}(t)}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$\nR = \\frac{L(0) \\exp(f\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{control}} t)}{L(0) \\exp(\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{control}} t)}\n$$\nThe initial length $L(0)$ cancels out. Using the property of exponents $\\exp(x)/\\exp(y) = \\exp(x-y)$:\n$$\nR = \\exp(f\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{control}} t - \\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{control}} t) = \\exp((f-1)\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{control}} t)\n$$\nThis expression shows that the ratio $R$ is independent of the initial length $L(0)$.\n\n**4. Numerical Computation:**\nFirst, we compute the value of the control strain rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{control}}$ using the given parameters: $a = 0.25$, $r = 0.8\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$, and $\\frac{T}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = 1.5$.\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{control}} = (0.25) \\times (0.8\\,\\text{h}^{-1}) \\times (1.5) = (0.2\\,\\text{h}^{-1}) \\times (1.5) = 0.3\\,\\text{h}^{-1}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the dimensionless exponent $(f-1)\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{control}} t$, using $f = 0.6$ and $t = 5\\,\\text{h}$:\n$$\n(f-1)\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{control}} t = (0.6 - 1) \\times (0.3\\,\\text{h}^{-1}) \\times (5\\,\\text{h}) = (-0.4) \\times (1.5) = -0.6\n$$\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\exp(-0.6)\n$$\nCalculating the value of the exponential function:\n$$\nR \\approx 0.548811636\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nR \\approx 0.5488\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5488}\n$$", "id": "4936430"}]}
