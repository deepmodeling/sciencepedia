The derivation must start from the two foundational principles given.\n\nLet $R$ represent the number of reads aligned to a specific genomic locus (the promoter window) and $N$ represent the total number of aligned reads in a sequencing library.\n\nThe first principle states that the observed occupancy, which we can denote as $O$, of a genomic locus is the fraction of total aligned reads that fall within that locus. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$O = \\frac{R}{N}$$\nThis quantity represents the raw, unnormalized signal proportion for the locus.\n\nThe second principle describes the normalization procedure required to compare libraries with different sequencing depths (i.e., different total reads $N$). The normalized occupancy, let's denote it as $O_{\\text{norm}}$, is calculated in units of Reads Per Million mapped reads (RPM) by multiplying the raw occupancy by $10^6$.\n$$O_{\\text{norm}} = O \\times 10^6 = \\frac{R}{N} \\times 10^6$$\n\nWe are given data for two libraries: the H3K27ac Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) library and the corresponding input control library. We will use the subscripts 'ChIP' and 'input' to distinguish between them.\n\nApplying the normalization formula to both libraries, we get the normalized occupancy for the ChIP library:\n$$O_{\\text{norm, ChIP}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{ChIP}}}{N_{\\text{ChIP}}} \\times 10^6$$\nAnd the normalized occupancy for the input library:\n$$O_{\\text{norm, input}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{input}}}{N_{\\text{input}}} \\times 10^6$$\n\nThe fold-enrichment, denoted as $FE$, is defined as the ratio of the normalized H3K27ac signal at the promoter (from the ChIP library) to the normalized background signal at the same promoter (from the input library). This ratio compares the signal in the experiment to the control, after accounting for differences in sequencing depth.\n\nThe expression for fold-enrichment is therefore:\n$$FE = \\frac{O_{\\text{norm, ChIP}}}{O_{\\text{norm, input}}}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the normalized occupancies, we derive the explicit expression for fold-enrichment:\n$$FE = \\frac{\\frac{R_{\\text{ChIP}}}{N_{\\text{ChIP}}} \\times 10^6}{\\frac{R_{\\text{input}}}{N_{\\text{input}}} \\times 10^6}$$\n\nAs stated in the second principle, the multiplicative constant of $10^6$ is common to both the numerator and the denominator, and thus it cancels out. This simplifies the expression to:\n$$FE = \\frac{R_{\\text{ChIP}}/N_{\\text{ChIP}}}{R_{\\text{input}}/N_{\\text{input}}}$$\nThis can be rearranged for calculation as:\n$$FE = \\frac{R_{\\text{ChIP}}}{R_{\\text{input}}} \\cdot \\frac{N_{\\text{input}}}{N_{\\text{ChIP}}}$$\nThis is the derived explicit expression for the fold-enrichment. It represents the ratio of ChIP to input reads at the specific locus, normalized by the ratio of total library sizes.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of the fold-enrichment using the provided data:\n-   Reads in ChIP promoter window: $R_{\\text{ChIP}} = 2450$\n-   Total reads in ChIP library: $N_{\\text{ChIP}} = 31.2 \\times 10^{6}$\n-   Reads in input promoter window: $R_{\\text{input}} = 350$\n-   Total reads in input library: $N_{\\text{input}} = 14.8 \\times 10^{6}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$FE = \\frac{2450}{350} \\cdot \\frac{14.8 \\times 10^6}{31.2 \\times 10^6}$$\nThe factor of $10^6$ cancels from the library size ratio.
