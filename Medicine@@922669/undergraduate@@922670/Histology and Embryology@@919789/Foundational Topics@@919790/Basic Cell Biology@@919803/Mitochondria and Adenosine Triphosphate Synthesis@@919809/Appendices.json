The first step is to validate the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem provides the following definitions and conditions for the F1Fo-ATP synthase:\n1.  The catalytic F1 sector has three catalytic sites.\n2.  The F1 sector produces exactly one ATP molecule for each $1/3$ turn of the central stalk.\n3.  The F1 sector yields exactly $3$ ATP molecules per full revolution of the central stalk.\n4.  The Fo sector contains a ring of $n_c$ identical $c$-subunits.\n5.  Each $c$-subunit is associated with the translocation of exactly one proton ($H^{+}$) per cycle.\n6.  One full revolution of the $c$-ring is driven by the translocation of exactly $n_c$ protons.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed for its validity.\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem describes a simplified but standard and widely accepted model of the F1Fo-ATP synthase, a central enzyme in cellular bioenergetics. The mechanism described, coupling proton flow to mechanical rotation and subsequent ATP synthesis, is the core of the chemiosmotic theory. The parameters given, such as $3$ ATP per revolution and a variable number of $c$-subunits ($n_c$), are consistent with current biochemical literature. For instance, the $c$-ring stoichiometry of $n_c=8$ is found in vertebrate mitochondria, while $n_c=10$ is characteristic of yeast mitochondria. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem asks for the derivation of a specific ratio and its evaluation for given parameters. The information provided is sufficient to establish a clear stoichiometric relationship between proton translocation and ATP synthesis. The question is unambiguous and leads to a unique solution.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and objective language, free of any subjective or opinion-based assertions.\n\nThe problem is self-contained and internally consistent. Point 3 is a direct consequence of point 2 ($1 \\text{ ATP} / (1/3 \\text{ turn}) = 3 \\text{ ATP} / (1 \\text{ turn})$). The F1 and Fo sectors are part of a single complex, where the rotation of the $c$-ring in Fo is mechanically coupled to the rotation of the central stalk in F1. This ensures that a \"full revolution\" is a common reference for both proton translocation and ATP synthesis. The problem statement is therefore valid.\n\n### Step 3: Proceed to Solution\n\n**Derivation of the general expression for the $H^{+}/\\mathrm{ATP}$ ratio**\n\nThe F1Fo-ATP synthase functions as a rotary motor. The rotation of the central components (the $c$-ring and the attached central stalk) couples two distinct processes: the flow of protons across the membrane and the synthesis of ATP. We can determine the ratio of protons required per ATP synthesized by considering the stoichiometry of each process over one full revolution of the rotor.\n\nLet one full revolution be a rotation of $360$ degrees or $2\\pi$ radians.\n\nFrom the problem statement, one full revolution of the $c$-ring is driven by the translocation of $n_c$ protons. Let $N_{H^+}$ be the number of protons translocated per revolution.\n$$N_{H^+} = n_c$$\n\nAlso from the problem statement, one full revolution of the central stalk results in the synthesis of exactly $3$ ATP molecules. Let $N_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$ be the number of ATP molecules synthesized per revolution.\n$$N_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = 3$$\n\nSince the $c$-ring and the central stalk are mechanically coupled and rotate together, a full revolution of one corresponds to a full revolution of the other. Therefore, we can directly relate the number of protons translocated to the number of ATP molecules synthesized over this common event of one full revolution.\n\nThe proton requirement per ATP, denoted by the ratio $H^{+}/\\mathrm{ATP}$, is the total number of protons translocated divided by the total number of ATP molecules synthesized during the same process interval (one revolution).\n\n$$\\frac{H^{+}}{\\mathrm{ATP}} = \\frac{N_{H^+}}{N_{\\mathrm{ATP}}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\frac{H^{+}}{\\mathrm{ATP}} = \\frac{n_c}{3}$$\nThis is the general expression for the proton-to-ATP ratio as a function of the number of $c$-subunits, $n_c$.\n\n**Evaluation for $n_c = 8$ and $n_c = 10$**\n\nThe problem requires the evaluation of this expression for two specific cases.\n\nFor a $c$-ring with $n_c = 8$ (as in vertebrates):\n$$\\left(\\frac{H^{+}}{\\mathrm{ATP}}\\right)_{n_c=8} = \\frac{8}{3}$$\n\nFor a $c$-ring with $n_c = 10$ (as in yeast):\n$$\\left(\\frac{H^{+}}{\\mathrm{ATP}}\\right)_{n_c=10} = \\frac{10}{3}$$\n\nThese are the proton costs for synthesizing one molecule of ATP in each respective system. They are requested as exact fractions.\n\n**Computation of the fold-change in ATP generated per proton**\n\nThe final part of the problem asks for the fold-change in ATP generated per proton, which is a measure of the relative efficiency of ATP synthesis. This is the ratio of the $\\mathrm{ATP}/H^{+}$ ratios for the two systems.\n\nThe quantity \"ATP generated per proton\" is the reciprocal of the $H^{+}/\\mathrm{ATP}$ ratio.\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{ATP}}{H^{+}} = \\left(\\frac{H^{+}}{\\mathrm{ATP}}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{3}{n_c}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate this efficiency for each system.\nFor $n_c = 8$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{ATP}}{H^{+}}\\right)_{n_c=8} = \\frac{3}{8}$$\n\nFor $n_c = 10$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{ATP}}{H^{+}}\\right)_{n_c=10} = \\frac{3}{10}$$\n\nThe problem requires the fold-change, defined as the ratio $\\left(\\mathrm{ATP}/H^{+}\\right)_{n_c=8} \\big/ \\left(\\mathrm{ATP}/H^{+}\\right)_{n_c=10}$.\n\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{ATP}}{H^{+}}\\right)_{n_c=8}}{\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{ATP}}{H^{+}}\\right)_{n_c=10}} = \\frac{3/8}{3/10}$$\n\nWe can simplify this complex fraction:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{3}{8} \\times \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{30}{24}$$\n\nReducing the fraction to its simplest form by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $6$:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{5}{4}$$\n\nThis result indicates that an ATP synthase with an $8$-subunit $c$-ring is more efficient, producing $5/4$ (or $1.25$) times as much ATP per proton as one with a $10$-subunit $c$-ring.\n\nThe three requested results, in order, are:\n1.  $\\left(H^{+}/\\mathrm{ATP}\\right)_{n_c=8} = \\frac{8}{3}$\n2.  $\\left(H^{+}/\\mathrm{ATP}\\right)_{n_c=10} = \\frac{10}{3}$\n3.
