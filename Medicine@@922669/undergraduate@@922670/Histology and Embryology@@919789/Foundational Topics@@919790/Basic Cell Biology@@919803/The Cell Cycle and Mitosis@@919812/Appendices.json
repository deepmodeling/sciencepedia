This exercise challenges you to recognize the distinct morphological features of anaphase from a series of descriptions. Accurately identifying this dynamic stage is crucial for understanding the fidelity of chromosome segregation. [@problem_id:1778969]", "problem": "A cell biologist is studying a synchronized culture of mammalian fibroblast cells using live-cell fluorescence microscopy. To visualize the genetic material, the cells are treated with a special stain that binds specifically to Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) and fluoresces under blue light. The biologist observes the dynamic changes in the stained material as the cells progress through mitosis. The goal is to accurately identify cells that are in the anaphase stage.\n\nWhich of the following descriptions most accurately characterizes the appearance and location of the fluorescently stained DNA in a typical animal cell during anaphase?\n\nA. The stained material, which was previously aligned in a single plane at the cell's equator, separates into two identical groups. Each group, now consisting of individual chromosomes, moves rapidly toward opposite poles of the cell, often appearing as V-shaped structures.\n\nB. The stained material, initially appearing as a diffuse mass within a distinct nuclear boundary, condenses into visible, discrete, and elongated thread-like structures that are scattered randomly throughout the cytoplasm after the nuclear boundary disappears.\n\nC. The highly condensed, X-shaped stained structures are all perfectly aligned along a single plane at the center of the cell, forming a distinct line equidistant from the two cell poles.\n\nD. Two separate and distinct clusters of stained material are now located at opposite poles of the cell. The material in each cluster begins to uncoil and becomes less distinct, and a new boundary begins to form around each of these two new sets.\n\nE. The stained material appears as a single, diffuse, and grainy mass occupying a large, well-defined spherical area (the nucleus). Individual chromosome structures are not distinguishable.", "solution": "The DNA-specific fluorescent stain reveals chromatin and chromosomes throughout the cell cycle. In interphase, the stained DNA appears diffuse within an intact nucleus; with mitotic entry, DNA condenses into discrete chromosomes. The canonical mitotic sequence in typical animal cells is: prophase (chromatin condenses), prometaphase (nuclear envelope breaks down and chromosomes become fully discrete and attach to spindle microtubules), metaphase (chromosomes align at the metaphase plate), anaphase (sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles), and telophase (chromosomes arrive at poles, decondense, and nuclear envelopes reform).\n\nTo identify anaphase, the hallmark is the separation of sister chromatids at the centromeres and their movement toward opposite poles along kinetochore microtubules. As they move poleward, chromatids often appear V-shaped or J-shaped because the centromere leads and chromosome arms trail due to spindle forces and microtubule depolymerization-driven pulling. Therefore, an anaphase cell will show two diverging, symmetrical sets of individual chromosomes migrating away from the equatorial plane toward opposite poles.\n\nNow evaluate each option:\n- Option A describes chromosomes that were previously aligned at the equator separating into two identical groups, each consisting of individual chromosomes moving rapidly to opposite poles and appearing V-shaped. This is the definitive description of anaphase.\n- Option B describes condensation from a diffuse mass and disappearance of the nuclear boundary with chromosomes scattered throughout the cytoplasm. This corresponds to prophase/prometaphase, not anaphase.\n- Option C describes highly condensed X-shaped chromosomes aligned at a single plane equidistant from both poles, which is metaphase, not anaphase.\n- Option D describes two clusters at opposite poles with decondensation and reformation of nuclear boundaries, which is telophase, not anaphase.\n- Option E describes a diffuse, grainy mass within a well-defined nucleus with indistinct individual chromosomes, which is interphase, not anaphase.\n\nTherefore, the correct characterization of anaphase is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1778969"}, {"introduction": "The time a cell spends in each phase of the cell cycle is proportional to the number of cells found in that phase at any given moment in an asynchronous population. This principle allows biologists to estimate the duration of mitotic stages from static microscope images, a technique vital for fields like developmental biology and cancer research.

This exercise explores the critical function of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC), a key safety mechanism that ensures proper chromosome attachment. By comparing the consequences of SAC failure in organisms with different division mechanics, you will gain a deeper understanding of how molecular control systems integrate with the physical processes of cell division. [@problem_id:1778978]", "problem": "A cell biologist is studying two different diploid eukaryotic organisms: a species of budding fungus and a mammalian species. Both species have a diploid chromosome number of $2n$. The biologist introduces a mutation that completely disables the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC). This mutation causes the cells to exit metaphase and enter anaphase after a fixed duration, irrespective of whether all chromosomes are correctly attached to the mitotic spindle.\n\nThe fungal cell divides by budding, a process where a small daughter cell grows out from a larger mother cell. Cytokinesis in this fungus always occurs at the narrow 'bud neck' that connects the mother and daughter cells. A successful mitosis in this organism requires the nucleus to first migrate to the bud neck and then elongate through it before chromosome segregation can properly partition the genome.\n\nThe mammalian cell divides symmetrically, with cytokinesis occurring via a contractile ring that forms midway between the two groups of segregated chromosomes during anaphase.\n\nConsidering the distinct division mechanisms, what is the most probable outcome for the chromosome content of the two daughter cells resulting from the first mitotic division in each cell line after the SAC has been disabled?\n\nA. Both cell types will most likely produce two aneuploid daughter cells (e.g., one with $2n+1$ and one with $2n-1$ chromosomes).\n\nB. The fungal division will most likely yield one anucleate daughter cell and one tetraploid ($4n$) daughter cell, while the mammalian division will most likely yield two aneuploid daughter cells (e.g., $2n+1$ and $2n-1$).\n\nC. The fungal division will most likely yield two diploid ($2n$) daughter cells, while the mammalian division will most likely yield one anucleate cell and one tetraploid ($4n$) cell.\n\nD. Both cell types will most likely produce one anucleate daughter cell and one tetraploid ($4n$) daughter cell.\n\nE. The fungal division will most likely result in polyploid cells larger than $4n$, while the mammalian division will result in widespread apoptosis before division completes.", "solution": "1) Define the role of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC): The SAC delays anaphase onset until all kinetochores achieve proper bipolar attachment to spindle microtubules. Disabling the SAC forces anaphase after a fixed time regardless of attachment fidelity. Therefore, cells will initiate chromosome segregation without ensuring correct kinetochore-microtubule attachment or proper spindle orientation/positioning.\n\n2) Analyze the budding fungal cell’s division constraints: In this organism, cytokinesis is spatially fixed at the bud neck between mother and daughter. For successful mitosis, the nucleus must first migrate to the bud neck and then elongate through it, so that each side of the neck receives one set of segregated chromatids during anaphase. With the SAC disabled, anaphase can begin before the nucleus reaches and spans the bud neck. Consequently:\n- The spindle can elongate entirely within the mother cell, so both spindle poles and both segregating chromatid sets remain on the mother side.\n- Cytokinesis still occurs at the bud neck independently of nuclear position. Thus, the bud is severed without receiving chromatin, producing an anucleate daughter.\n- The mother retains both post-segregation chromatid sets. After cohesin cleavage at anaphase onset, these two sets together correspond to two full complements of the genome. Post-mitotic nuclear reassembly in one compartment yields genomic content equivalent to $4n$ (whether as a single $4n$ nucleus or two $2n$ nuclei that effectively sum to $4n$ genetic content in that cell). Therefore, the most probable outcome is one anucleate bud and one tetraploid mother ($4n$).\n\n3) Analyze the mammalian cell’s symmetric division: In mammalian cells, cytokinesis is determined by signals from the central spindle and astral microtubules, forming a contractile ring equidistant between the two segregating chromosome masses during anaphase. With SAC disabled:\n- Cells enter anaphase on schedule even if some kinetochores are unattached or merotelically attached.\n- The spindle is typically bipolar and positioned so that each nascent daughter cell inherits one spindle pole.\n- The contractile ring forms at the midzone between the segregating masses; cytokinesis proceeds to produce two cells.\n- Because attachments were not fully corrected, chromosome segregation errors occur, creating unequal distribution of chromosomes. Each daughter cell most likely becomes aneuploid (e.g., $2n+1$ and $2n-1$), rather than producing one anucleate and a $4n$ cell, since the cleavage furrow forms between the two segregated masses rather than at a fixed external landmark that could sever off a nucleus-free compartment.\n\n4) Compare outcomes:\n- Budding fungus: fixed-site cytokinesis at the bud neck combined with premature anaphase before nuclear migration yields one anucleate daughter and one tetraploid ($4n$) daughter.\n- Mammal: furrow placement follows spindle geometry; premature anaphase primarily increases missegregation, yielding two aneuploid daughters rather than an anucleate and a $4n$ cell.\n\nTherefore, the most probable outcomes match option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1778978"}]}
