Since the PAS intensity is similar across all three samples, this confirms that the concentration of neutral glycoproteins is constant, as stated in the problem setup.

The observation that staining is retained only in $S_2$ at this pH definitively confirms its high sulfation content.

Alcian Blue is not metachromatic, and the PAS signal points to neutral, not acidic, glycoconjugates as the primary target in this context.\n*   E is incorrect because ionic strength weakens electrostatic binding, and the persistent stain in $S_2$ is due to sulfation, not hyaluronic acid.\n\nTherefore, the comprehensive explanation provided in option B is the only one that is fully consistent with the data and principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4897287"}]}
