This principle states that the rate of change of the population is the sum of all sources (gains) minus the sum of all sinks (losses).\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\text{Gains} - \\text{Losses}\n$$\nThe gains come from cell proliferation. The problem specifies that proliferation is density-limited and follows a logistic model with a per-capita rate $r$ and a carrying capacity $K$. The total proliferation rate is therefore given by the logistic growth term:\n$$\n\\text{Proliferation Gain} = r N \\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right)\n$$\nThe losses come from two processes: apoptosis and dedifferentiation. The problem states that these are per-capita processes.\nThe loss due to apoptosis occurs at a per-capita rate $a$. Following mass-action kinetics, the total rate of loss from apoptosis is the per-capita rate multiplied by the population size:\n$$\n\\text{Apoptosis Loss} = a N\n$$\nSimilarly, the loss due to dedifferentiation back to fibroblasts occurs at a per-capita rate $d$. The total rate of loss from dedifferentiation is:\n$$\n\\text{Dedifferentiation Loss} = d N\n$$\nCombining these terms, the total rate of change of the myofibroblast population $N(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = r N \\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right) - a N - d N\n$$\nThis is the first-order ordinary differential equation that models the dynamics of the myofibroblast population $N(t)$.\n\n2.

The first is the trivial steady state:\n$$\nN^{*} = 0\n$$\nThis corresponds to the extinction of the myofibroblast population.\n\nThe second, nonzero steady state is found by setting the term in the brackets to zero:\n$$\nr \\left(1 - \\frac{N^{*}}{K}\\right) - a - d = 0\n$$\nWe now solve this equation for $N^{*}$:\n$$\nr \\left(1 - \\frac{N^{*}}{K}\\right) = a + d\n$$\n$$\n1 - \\frac{N^{*}}{K} = \\frac{a+d}{r}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{N^{*}}{K} = 1 - \\frac{a+d}{r}\n$$\n$$\nN^{*} = K \\left(1 - \\frac{a+d}{r}\\right)\n$$\nThis can also be written as:\n$$\nN^{*} = K \\left(\\frac{r - (a+d)}{r}\\right) = K \\frac{r - a - d}{r}\n$$\nFor this steady state to be biologically admissible, the population number must be strictly positive, i.e., $N^{*} > 0$.
