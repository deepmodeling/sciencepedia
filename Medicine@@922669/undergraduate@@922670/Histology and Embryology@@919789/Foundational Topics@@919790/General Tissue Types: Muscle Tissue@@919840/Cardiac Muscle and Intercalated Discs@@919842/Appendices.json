The language is precise, and the setup is self-contained and logically consistent. The parameters are within physically plausible ranges for biological systems. The problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Calculation\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Analytical Expressions**\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the coupling coefficient $k$ in terms of the junctional conductance $G_{j}$ and the membrane leak conductance of the second cell, $G_{m2}$. At steady state, a direct current is injected into cell $1$, resulting in voltage deviations $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$. We apply the principle of current conservation (Kirchhoff's Current Law) to cell $2$. The current flowing from cell $1$ to cell $2$ through the gap junction is given by Ohm's law as $I_{j} = G_{j}(V_{1} - V_{2})$. The current leaking out of cell $2$ through its membrane is $I_{m2} = G_{m2}V_{2}$. Since no external current is injected into cell $2$, the current entering it must equal the current leaving it at steady state.\n\n$$I_{j} = I_{m2}$$\n$$G_{j}(V_{1} - V_{2}) = G_{m2}V_{2}$$\n\nWe rearrange this equation to solve for the ratio $k = V_{2}/V_{1}$.\n$$G_{j}V_{1} - G_{j}V_{2} = G_{m2}V_{2}$$\n$$G_{j}V_{1} = (G_{j} + G_{m2})V_{2}$$\n$$k = \\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}} = \\frac{G_{j}}{G_{j} + G_{m2}}$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the junctional conductance $G_{j}$ under the fragmentation model. Let this conductance be denoted $G_{j,f}$. The total junctional conductance is the product of the number of active channels, $N_{ch}$, and the single-channel conductance, $g_{c}$. The number of channels is the product of the channel density, $\\rho$, and the total active area, $A_{active}$.\n\n$$G_{j,f} = N_{ch} \\cdot g_{c} = (\\rho \\cdot A_{active}) \\cdot g_{c}$$\n\nThe plaque of initial total area $A$ fragments into $n$ equal circular islands. The problem states that the radius $r$ of each island is defined by the relation $A = n\\pi r^{2}$. Thus, the radius of a single island is $r = \\sqrt{A/(n\\pi)}$. Each island has a non-conducting peripheral belt of width $\\delta$. The active, channel-bearing part of each island is therefore a circle of radius $r_{active} = r - \\delta$.\n\nThe active area of a single island is $A_{active, island} = \\pi (r_{active})^{2} = \\pi (r - \\delta)^{2}$.\nThe total active area for all $n$ islands is the sum of the individual active areas:\n$$A_{active} = n \\cdot A_{active, island} = n \\pi (r - \\delta)^{2}$$\n\nWe substitute the expression for $r$:\n$$A_{active} = n \\pi \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{A}{n\\pi}} - \\delta\\right)^{2}$$\nTo simplify, we can factor $\\sqrt{n\\pi}$ outside the parenthesis before squaring:\n$$A_{active} = \\left(\\sqrt{n\\pi} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{A}}{\\sqrt{n\\pi}} - \\delta\\right)\\right)^{2} = (\\sqrt{A} - \\delta\\sqrt{n\\pi})^{2}$$\n\nThe junctional conductance after fragmentation, $G_{j,f}$, is then:\n$$G_{j,f} = \\rho g_{c} A_{active} = \\rho g_{c} (\\sqrt{A} - \\delta\\sqrt{n\\pi})^{2}$$\nThis completes the required derivations for the first task.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Ratio**\n\nWe need to compute the ratio of the coupling coefficient after fragmentation, $k_{f}$, to that before fragmentation, $k_{0}$.\nThe coupling coefficient before fragmentation, $k_{0}$, corresponds to a single plaque ($n=1$) with no non-conducting border ($\\delta=0$). In this case, the active area is simply $A$. The junctional conductance is $G_{j,0} = \\rho g_{c} A$.\nThe initial coupling coefficient is:\n$$k_{0} = \\frac{G_{j,0}}{G_{j,0} + G_{m2}}$$\nThe coupling coefficient after fragmentation is:\n$$k_{f} = \\frac{G_{j,f}}{G_{j,f} + G_{m2}}$$\nThe desired ratio is:\n$$\\frac{k_{f}}{k_{0}} = \\frac{G_{j,f} / (G_{j,f} + G_{m2})}{G_{j,0} / (G_{j,0} + G_{m2})} = \\frac{G_{j,f}}{G_{j,0}} \\cdot \\frac{G_{j,0} + G_{m2}}{G_{j,f} + G_{m2}}$$\n\nWe now substitute the numerical values, ensuring consistent units.
