These GAGs possess a high density of negatively charged sulfate ($SO_4^{2-}$) and carboxyl ($COO^-$) groups. At physiological pH, these groups are ionized, creating a high negative *fixed charge density* (FCD) within the cartilage matrix.\n2.  **Donnan Osmotic Pressure:** To maintain electroneutrality, mobile positive ions (cations, e.g., $Na^+$) from the surrounding synovial fluid are attracted into the matrix, increasing the total ion concentration within the tissue relative to the external solution. This concentration difference generates a significant osmotic pressure gradient (the Donnan effect), which draws water into the tissue.\n3.  **Swelling and Prestress:** The influx of water causes the matrix to swell. This swelling is resisted by the tensile forces developed in the entangled collagen fibrillar network. The result is a state of equilibrium where the osmotic swelling pressure is balanced by the tensile stress in the collagen fibers. This internal, mechanically-induced tension is known as prestress.\n4.  **Equilibrium Compressive Modulus:** When an external compressive load is applied and the tissue reaches equilibrium (i.e., all fluid flow has ceased), the load is borne entirely by the solid matrix. The equilibrium compressive modulus reflects the intrinsic stiffness of this solid matrix.\n5.  **Effect of Increasing Proteoglycan Content:** An increase in proteoglycan content leads to a higher FCD. This, in turn, magnifies the Donnan osmotic effect, leading to a greater osmotic swelling pressure. To reach a new equilibrium, the collagen network must stretch further to generate a higher opposing tensile stress. The matrix becomes more swollen and more highly prestressed. This highly pressurized and tensioned state makes the matrix more resistant to further deformation under an external compressive load.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, increasing proteoglycan content *increases* the equilibrium compressive modulus of hyaline cartilage.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The effective solid volume fraction is approximately $0.195$, and increasing proteoglycan content increases the equilibrium compressive modulus by elevating fixed-charge-driven osmotic swelling pressure resisted by the collagen network.**\n-   **Volume Fraction:** The calculated value is $\\approx 0.195$. This is correct.\n-   **Qualitative Prediction:** The prediction that the modulus increases is correct. The stated mechanism—elevated osmotic swelling pressure due to fixed charges, resisted by the collagen network—is the scientifically accepted explanation. This is correct.\n-   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. The effective solid volume fraction is exactly $0.25$, and increasing proteoglycan content decreases the compressive modulus because it dilutes the collagen network.**\n-   **Volume Fraction:** The value $0.25$ corresponds to the solid *mass* fraction ($25\\ \\mathrm{g} / 100\\ \\mathrm{g}$), not the solid *volume* fraction. Since the densities of the solid components are not equal to $1.00\\ \\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, the mass and volume fractions are different. This is incorrect.\n-   **Qualitative Prediction:** The prediction that the modulus *decreases* is contrary to established principles. The reasoning is also flawed; the osmotic effect is dominant over any minor \"dilution\" effect. This is incorrect.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. The effective solid volume fraction is approximately $0.30$, and changing proteoglycan content has negligible effect on compressive modulus because interstitial water carries compressive loads.**\n-   **Volume Fraction:** The value $0.30$ is the mass fraction of proteoglycans within the dry weight, not the total solid volume fraction of the hydrated tissue. This is incorrect.\n-   **Qualitative Prediction:** The prediction of a negligible effect is incorrect. The reasoning that water carries the load is only applicable to the transient (high strain rate) response due to fluid pressurization, not the *equilibrium* response, where the load is fully transferred to the solid matrix. This is incorrect.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. The effective solid volume fraction is approximately $0.18$, and increasing proteoglycan content reduces the high-rate compressive modulus by increasing tissue permeability.**\n-   **Volume Fraction:** The calculated value is $0.195$. $0.18$ is a poor approximation. This is incorrect.\n-   **Qualitative Prediction:** This statement incorrectly addresses the *high-rate* modulus when the question asks about the *equilibrium* modulus. Furthermore, increasing proteoglycan content *decreases*, not increases, tissue permeability, which would in fact lead to a higher, not lower, high-rate modulus. The entire statement is flawed.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. The effective solid volume fraction is approximately $0.195$, and increasing proteoglycan content decreases the equilibrium compressive modulus because added water makes the tissue more compressible.**\n-   **Volume Fraction:** The value $0.195$ is correct.\n-   **Qualitative Prediction:** The prediction that the modulus *decreases* is incorrect. The reasoning is also fundamentally flawed; the osmotically drawn water creates a pressurized, prestressed state that *stiffens* the tissue against compression, rather than making it more compressible.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4903965"}, {"introduction": "Hyaline cartilage is avascular, meaning its cells are not fed by a network of capillaries.

Hyaline cartilage is indeed an avascular tissue, meaning it lacks blood vessels.

It does not contain subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe transport of molecules by diffusion is governed by Fick's laws. The change in concentration $C$ over time $t$ at a position $x$ is described by Fick's second law, which in one dimension is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nA characteristic time scale, $\\tau$, for this process can be estimated by dimensional analysis. The left side has dimensions of $[Concentration]/[Time]$, and the right side has dimensions of $([Length]^2/[Time]) \\times ([Concentration]/[Length]^2)$. For the equation to be dimensionally consistent, we can relate the characteristic time $\\tau$ to the characteristic length scale $L$ and the diffusion coefficient $D$. By rearranging the dimensions, we find:\n$$\n[Time] \\approx \\frac{[Length]^2}{[D]} = \\frac{[Length]^2}{[Length]^2/[Time]}\n$$\nThis gives the well-established relationship for the characteristic diffusion time:\n$$\n\\tau \\approx \\frac{L^2}{D}\n$$\nThis time scale represents the approximate time required for the concentration profile to significantly change or approach a new steady state over the distance $L$.\n\nWe are given:\n-   $L = 1\\ \\text{mm}$\n-   $D = 3\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{cm}^2/\\text{s}$\n\nFor the calculation, the units must be consistent. We will convert $L$ from millimeters to centimeters:\n$$\nL = 1\\ \\text{mm} = 0.1\\ \\text{cm} = 10^{-1}\\ \\text{cm}\n$$\nNow, we can calculate $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\tau \\approx \\frac{(10^{-1}\\ \\text{cm})^2}{3\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{cm}^2/\\text{s}} = \\frac{10^{-2}\\ \\text{cm}^2}{3\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{cm}^2/\\text{s}}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau \\approx \\frac{1}{3} \\times 10^{4}\\ \\text{s} \\approx 0.333... \\times 10^{4}\\ \\text{s} = 3333.3...\\ \\text{s}\n$$\nExpressing this in scientific notation:\n$$\n\\tau \\approx 3.3 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{s}\n$$\nTo better understand this time scale, we convert it to hours. Knowing that $1\\ \\text{hour} = 3600\\ \\text{s}$:\n$$\n\\tau \\approx \\frac{3333.3\\ \\text{s}}{3600\\ \\text{s/h}} \\approx 0.926\\ \\text{h}\n$$\nSo, the characteristic time is approximately $3.3 \\times 10^3$ seconds, or about $0.9$ hours.\n\nNext, we address the physiological inference. The question is whether this time scale is compatible with sustaining cellular metabolic needs. Chondrocytes in articular cartilage have a very low metabolic rate, an evolutionary adaptation to their avascular, hypoxic environment. Their energy is derived primarily from anaerobic glycolysis. A characteristic time of approximately one hour for nutrient delivery and waste removal over a millimeter distance is not instantaneous, but it is sufficiently responsive to support the slow, steady metabolic activity of these cells. The very existence of viable cartilage tissue at thicknesses of several millimeters is empirical evidence that diffusion is a sufficient transport mechanism for this specific cell type. If diffusion were \"too slow,\" necrosis would occur, and thick, avascular cartilage would not be a viable biological structure. Therefore, the correct physiological inference is that diffusion *is* sufficiently fast to meet the specialized, low metabolic demands of chondrocytes.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\tau \\approx 3.3\\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{s}$ (about 0.9 h); diffusion is sufficiently fast to meet daily metabolic demands in avascular hyaline cartilage.**\n-   The calculated time scale $\\tau \\approx 3.3\\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{s}$ is correct.\n-   The physiological inference that diffusion is sufficiently fast to support the low metabolic demands of chondrocytes is also correct.

The geometrical term in the denominator: $4\\sqrt{R}\\delta^{3/2}$.\n    This can be calculated as $\\sqrt{R \\delta^3}$:\n    $\\sqrt{R \\delta^3} = \\sqrt{(5 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-7})^3} = \\sqrt{(5 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-21})} = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-27}} = \\sqrt{400 \\times 10^{-28}} = 20 \\times 10^{-14}\\ \\text{m}^2$.\n    The denominator is $4\\sqrt{R \\delta^3} = 4 \\times (20 \\times 10^{-14}\\ \\text{m}^2) = 80 \\times 10^{-14}\\ \\text{m}^2 = 8 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\text{m}^2$.\n\n4.  Calculate $E$:\n    $$E = \\frac{1.19625 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{N}}{8 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\text{m}^2} = 0.14953125 \\times 10^6\\ \\frac{\\text{N}}{\\text{m}^2}$$\n    $E = 149531.25\\ \\text{Pa} = 149.53\\ \\text{kPa}$.\n\nTo compare with the options, we convert Pascals to MegaPascals ($1\\ \\text{MPa} = 10^6\\ \\text{Pa}$):\n$E = 0.14953125\\ \\text{MPa}$.\n\nRounding this result to three significant figures gives $E \\approx 0.150\\ \\text{MPa}$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. $E \\approx 0.150\\ \\text{MPa}$**\nThis value matches our calculated result of $0.14953\\ \\text{MPa}$ when rounded to three significant figures.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $E \\approx 0.188\\ \\text{MPa}$**\nThis option represents a common error. It is the value of the reduced modulus, $E^\\ast$. We can calculate $E^\\ast$ by rearranging the Hertz equation as $E^\\ast = \\frac{3F}{4\\sqrt{R}\\delta^{3/2}}$.\n$$E^\\ast = \\frac{3 \\times (50 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{N})}{8 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\text{m}^2} = \\frac{150 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{N}}{8 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\text{m}^2} = 18.75 \\times 10^4\\ \\text{Pa}$$\n$$E^\\ast = 187500\\ \\text{Pa} = 0.1875\\ \\text{MPa}$$\nThis value rounds to $0.188\\ \\text{MPa}$. The question asks for the Young's modulus $E$, not the reduced modulus $E^\\ast$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $E \\approx 0.103\\ \\text{MPa}$**\nThis option results from another common mistake in relating $E$ and $E^\\ast$. An incorrect formula sometimes used is $E = E^\\ast (1 - \\nu)$. Let's test this:\n$$E = (0.1875\\ \\text{MPa}) \\times (1 - 0.45) = (0.1875\\ \\text{MPa}) \\times 0.55 = 0.103125\\ \\text{MPa}$$\nThis value rounds to $0.103\\ \\text{MPa}$. The factor $(1-\\nu)$ is incorrect for the definition of the reduced modulus in three-dimensional Hertzian contact. The correct factor is $(1-\\nu^2)$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $E \\approx 4.7\\ \\text{Pa}$**\nThis value is extremely small and physically unrealistic for cartilage, which typically has a modulus in the range of hundreds of kPa to a few MPa. The calculated value is $\\approx 150 \\text{ kPa}$. The value $4.7\\ \\text{Pa}$ is about $5$ orders of magnitude smaller. This option is likely the result of a gross error in unit conversion or formula application and is not physically plausible.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4903991"}]}
