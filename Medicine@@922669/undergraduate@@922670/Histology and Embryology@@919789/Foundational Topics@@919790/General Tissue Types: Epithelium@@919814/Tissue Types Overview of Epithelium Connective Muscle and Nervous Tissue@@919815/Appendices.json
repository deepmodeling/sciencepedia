We begin by formalizing the relationships provided in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we calculate the area of the rectangular epithelial sheet, $A$, from its length $L$ and width $W$.\nThe given values are $L = 1.20 \\text{ cm}$ and $W = 0.275 \\text{ cm}$.\n$$A = L \\times W$$\n$$A = (1.20 \\text{ cm}) \\times (0.275 \\text{ cm}) = 0.33 \\text{ cm}^2$$\n\nNext, we calculate the Transepithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER), which is defined as the area-normalized net resistance, $R_{\\text{net}}$.\nThe net resistance is given as $R_{\\text{net}} = 260 \\ \\Omega$.\n$$\\text{TEER} = R_{\\text{net}} \\times A$$\n$$\\text{TEER} = (260 \\ \\Omega) \\times (0.33 \\text{ cm}^2) = 85.8 \\ \\Omega \\cdot \\text{cm}^2$$\n\nThe paracellular conductance density, which we denote as $G_{\\text{density}}$, is the reciprocal of the TEER.

It is a well-formulated question based on fundamental principles of muscle physiology. I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution to this problem hinges on understanding the distinct mechanisms of excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle, with a specific focus on the role of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-type VGCCs, also known as dihydropyridine receptors or DHPRs) in each tissue type. The drug is a selective blocker of these channels.\n\n1.  **Skeletal Muscle (preparation i):**\n    In mature mammalian skeletal muscle, ECC involves a direct, physical coupling between the L-type VGCCs in the T-tubule membrane and the ryanodine receptors (RyR1) in the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). When an action potential propagates down the T-tubule, it causes a conformational change in the L-type VGCC. This channel acts primarily as a voltage sensor. The conformational change is mechanically transmitted to the RyR1, causing it to open and release a large quantity of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the SR into the cytosol. This flood of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the SR is the primary trigger for contraction. The influx of extracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ through the L-type VGCC itself is negligible and **not required** to trigger SR $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release. Therefore, blocking the pore of the L-type VGCC will have little to no effect on the voltage-sensing mechanism and the subsequent mechanical activation of RyR1.\n    *Prediction:* Application of the L-type VGCC blocker will cause **no significant change** in peak isometric tension.\n\n2.  **Cardiac Muscle (preparation ii):**\n    In ventricular cardiac muscle, the ECC mechanism is fundamentally different and is known as calcium-induced calcium release (CICR). During the plateau phase of the cardiac action potential, depolarization opens L-type VGCCs in the T-tubule membrane. This opening allows a significant influx of extracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ into the cardiomyocyte. This influx of \"trigger\" $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binds to and activates ryanodine receptors (RyR2) on the SR. The activation of RyR2 opens these channels, leading to the release of a much larger amount of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the SR. The strength of the cardiac contraction is directly proportional to the amount of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ released from the SR, which in turn is dependent on the magnitude of the initial \"trigger\" $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx through the L-type VGCCs.\n    *Prediction:* Blocking the L-type VGCCs will prevent the influx of trigger $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, thereby preventing or severely attenuating CICR. This will lead to a failure to generate a significant rise in cytosolic $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and, consequently, a **marked decrease** in peak isometric tension.\n\n3.  **Vascular Smooth Muscle (preparation iii):**\n    The regulation of contraction in smooth muscle is complex, but it is highly dependent on the influx of extracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Field stimulation will cause depolarization, which opens L-type VGCCs. The resulting influx of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ contributes to the increase in cytosolic $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in two ways: (1) by directly binding to calmodulin to initiate the contractile cascade (activation of Myosin Light Chain Kinase), and (2) by potentially triggering CICR from the less-developed SR. Sustained contraction (tone) in vascular smooth muscle, in particular, relies heavily on a continuous influx of extracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Therefore, blocking the L-type VGCCs, a major pathway for this influx, will substantially reduce the ability of the muscle to develop and maintain tension.\n    *Prediction:* Blocking the L-type VGCCs will significantly inhibit the rise in cytosolic $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ necessary for contraction, leading to a **marked decrease** in isometric tone.\n\n**Summary of Predictions:**\n- Skeletal muscle: No significant change.\n- Cardiac muscle: Marked decrease.\n- Smooth muscle: Marked decrease.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Skeletal muscle: no significant change; Cardiac muscle: marked decrease; Smooth muscle: marked decrease.**\nThis option perfectly aligns with the derived predictions based on the distinct ECC mechanisms in the three muscle types. Skeletal muscle ECC is independent of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx through L-type channels, whereas both cardiac and vascular smooth muscle contraction are critically dependent on it.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Skeletal muscle: marked decrease comparable to cardiac; Cardiac muscle: no significant change; Smooth muscle: marked decrease.**\nThis option incorrectly states that skeletal muscle tension will decrease and cardiac muscle tension will not. This is the reverse of the established physiological roles of L-type VGCCs in these two tissues.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Skeletal muscle: no significant change; Cardiac muscle: no significant change except at very high stimulation frequencies; Smooth muscle: no significant change because it relies predominantly on intracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release.**\nThis option is incorrect on two counts. First, cardiac muscle contraction is dependent on L-type channel influx for every beat, not just at high frequencies. A blocker would cause a marked decrease at any stimulation frequency. Second, it incorrectly claims that smooth muscle relies predominantly on intracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release and would be unaffected. Vascular smooth muscle tone is highly dependent on extracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Skeletal muscle: increase due to reduced $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ efflux; Cardiac muscle: marked decrease; Smooth muscle: marked decrease.**\nThis option makes the unfounded claim that tension in skeletal muscle will increase. The drug is an L-type VGCC *blocker*, which inhibits $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ *influx*. It has no direct effect on efflux mechanisms (like SERCA or PMCA pumps) that would lead to an increase in intracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. All three tissues exhibit equivalent decreases because they all rely equally on extracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx for contraction.**\nThis option incorrectly assumes that the reliance on extracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is equal across all three muscle types. This ignores the fundamental difference in the ECC mechanism of skeletal muscle compared to cardiac and smooth muscle. The effect is not equivalent; it is negligible in skeletal muscle and profound in the other two.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4944457"}, {"introduction": "The primary function of nervous tissue is rapid communication, often over long distances.
