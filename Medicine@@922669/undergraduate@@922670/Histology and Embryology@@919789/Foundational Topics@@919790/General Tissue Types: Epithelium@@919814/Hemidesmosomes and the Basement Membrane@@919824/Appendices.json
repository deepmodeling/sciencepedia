The equilibrium dissociation constant ($K_d$) is defined by the law of mass action at equilibrium. The total receptor density per unit membrane area, $R$, is fixed across conditions.

It describes a standard, simplified model of reversible receptor-ligand binding, which is a fundamental concept in biochemistry and cell biology. The provided parameters are physically plausible, and the tasks are clearly defined. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for two parts: first, to derive the fractional occupancy of receptors, $\\theta$, as a function of ligand concentration, $L$, and the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$; second, to calculate the fold-change in adhesion strength when the ligand concentration changes from $L_1$ to $L_2$.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of Fractional Occupancy ($\\theta$)\n\nLet $[R_{free}]$ be the concentration (or surface density) of free receptors, $[L]$ be the concentration of free ligand, and $[RL]$ be the concentration (or surface density) of the receptor-ligand complex. The binding reaction is modeled as a simple reversible process:\n$$[R_{free}] + [L] \\rightleftharpoons [RL]$$\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the law of mass action at equilibrium:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[R_{free}][L]}{[RL]}$$\nThe total receptor density, $R$, which we denote as $[R_{tot}]$ for consistency in this derivation, is constant and is the sum of free and bound receptors:\n$$[R_{tot}] = [R_{free}] + [RL]$$\nFrom this conservation equation, we can express the free receptor concentration as:\n$$[R_{free}] = [R_{tot}] - [RL]$$\nSubstituting this expression for $[R_{free}]$ into the equation for $K_d$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{([R_{tot}] - [RL])[L]}{[RL]}$$\nOur goal is to find the fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, which is defined as the fraction of total receptors that are bound by ligand:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R_{tot}]}$$\nTo express $\\theta$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_d$, we must first solve the $K_d$ equation for the term $[RL]/[R_{tot}]$. We rearrange the equation:\n$$K_d [RL] = ([R_{tot}] - [RL])[L]$$\n$$K_d [RL] = [R_{tot}][L] - [RL][L]$$\n$$K_d [RL] + [RL][L] = [R_{tot}][L]$$\n$$[RL](K_d + [L]) = [R_{tot}][L]$$\nNow, we divide both sides by $[R_{tot}]$ and by $(K_d + [L])$:\n$$\\frac{[RL]}{[R_{tot}]} = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}$$\nBy definition, the left side of the equation is the fractional occupancy, $\\theta$. The problem uses $L$ for the free ligand concentration, so we write the derived expression as:\n$$\\theta(L) = \\frac{L}{K_d + L}$$\nThis completes the first part of the task. This equation is a form of the Langmuir binding isotherm.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of Fold-Change in Adhesion Strength\n\nThe problem states that the adhesion strength, let's call it $S$, is proportional to the number of ligand-occupied receptors per unit area. The number of occupied receptors per unit area is $[RL]$.\n$$S \\propto [RL]$$\nFrom the definition of fractional occupancy, we have $[RL] = \\theta \\cdot [R_{tot}]$. Since the total receptor density $[R_{tot}]$ (given as $R$) is fixed, the adhesion strength is directly proportional to the fractional occupancy $\\theta$:\n$$S \\propto \\theta$$\nLet $S_1$ and $S_2$ be the adhesion strengths at ligand concentrations $L_1$ and $L_2$, respectively. Let $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ be the corresponding fractional occupancies. The fold-change in adhesion strength is the ratio $\\frac{S_2}{S_1}$.\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{S_2}{S_1} = \\frac{k \\cdot \\theta_2}{k \\cdot \\theta_1} = \\frac{\\theta_2}{\\theta_1}$$\nwhere $k$ is the constant of proportionality. The total receptor density $R = 1000\\,\\mathrm{\\ receptors}\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}^{-2}$ is not required for this ratio calculation, as it is a constant factor that cancels out.\n\nUsing the derived expression for $\\theta$, we can write the fold-change as:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{\\frac{L_2}{K_d + L_2}}{\\frac{L_1}{K_d + L_1}} = \\frac{L_2}{L_1} \\cdot \\frac{K_d + L_1}{K_d + L_2}$$\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n$L_1 = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$L_2 = 40.0\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$K_d = 8.0\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n\nAll concentrations are in the same units ($\\mathrm{nM}$), so the units will cancel, resulting in a dimensionless number as required.\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{40.0}{2.0} \\cdot \\frac{8.0 + 2.0}{8.0 + 40.0}$$\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = 20.0 \\cdot \\frac{10.0}{48.0}$$\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = 20.0 \\cdot \\frac{10}{48} = 20.0 \\cdot \\frac{5}{24} = \\frac{100.0}{24} = \\frac{25}{6}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$\\frac{25}{6} \\approx 4.16666...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\text{Fold-change} \\approx 4.167$$\nThis is the fold-change in adhesion strength when the laminin concentration is increased from $2.0\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ to $40.0\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.167}$$", "id": "4899281"}, {"introduction": "A hemidesmosome's stability comes from the precise assembly of multiple protein components.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires us to analyze the system in its initial (wild-type) state and its final (BP230 knockout) state.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Initial State (Wild-Type)**\n\n- **Givens**: $N = 60$ integrins, $P = 40$ plectins, $B = 40$ BP230 molecules.\n\n- **Number of integrin–intermediate filament–coupled complexes**:\nAccording to assumption 1, the formation of such a complex requires one integrin and one plectin molecule. The number of complexes that can form is limited by the scarcest of these two components.\nNumber of complexes = $\\min(N, P) = \\min(60, 40) = 40$.\nSo, initially, there are $40$ integrin–intermediate filament–coupled complexes. The remaining $60 - 40 = 20$ integrins are not coupled to the intermediate filament network via plectin.\n\n- **Initial Adhesion Strength ($S_{initial}$)**:\nThe adhesion strength $S$ is defined as the total number of linkage paths.\n-   **Plectin paths**: Each of the $40$ complexes has a plectin-mediated path. This contributes $40 \\times 1 = 40$ units to $S$.\n-   **BP230 paths**: According to assumption 2, BP230 provides an additional path by binding to a plectin that is already part of a complex. We have $40$ such complexes and $B = 40$ available BP230 molecules. The number of additional BP230 paths is limited by the minimum of these two quantities.\n    Number of BP230 paths = $\\min(\\text{Number of complexes}, B) = \\min(40, 40) = 40$.\n    This contributes an additional $40 \\times 1 = 40$ units to $S$.\nThe total initial strength is the sum of contributions from all paths:\n$$S_{initial} = (\\text{Plectin paths}) + (\\text{BP230 paths}) = 40 + 40 = 80$$\n\n**2. Analysis of the Final State (BP230 Knockout)**\n\n- **Givens**: $N' = 60$ integrins, $P' = 40$ plectins, $B' = 0$ BP230 molecules.\n\n- **Number of integrin–intermediate filament–coupled complexes**:\nThe formation of these complexes depends only on integrin and plectin availability, which are unchanged.\nNumber of complexes = $\\min(N', P') = \\min(60, 40) = 40$.\nThe number of complexes remains at $40$.\n\n- **Final Adhesion Strength ($S_{final}$)**:\n-   **Plectin paths**: As before, there are $40$ complexes, so there are $40$ plectin-mediated paths. This contributes $40$ units to $S$.\n-   **BP230 paths**: Since the BP230 molecules have been eliminated ($B' = 0$), there are no BP230-mediated paths. This contribution is $0$.\nThe total final strength is:\n$$S_{final} = (\\text{Plectin paths}) + (\\text{BP230 paths}) = 40 + 0 = 40$$\n\n**3. Comparison of Initial and Final States**\n\n- **Change in number of complexes**: The number of complexes is $40$ in the initial state and $40$ in the final state. It remains unchanged. The reason is that the formation of these complexes is limited by plectin, and the availability of plectin did not change.\n\n- **Change in adhesion strength ($S$)**: The strength decreases from $S_{initial} = 80$ to $S_{final} = 40$.\nThe magnitude of the decrease is $S_{initial} - S_{final} = 80 - 40 = 40$.\nThe fractional decrease relative to the initial strength is:\n$$\\frac{S_{initial} - S_{final}}{S_{initial}} = \\frac{40}{80} = 0.5$$\nThis corresponds to a $50\\%$ decrease in adhesion strength.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $S$ decreases by approximately $50\\%$, while the number of integrin–intermediate filament–coupled complexes remains at $40$ because plectin is still the limiting factor.**\n- The calculated decrease in $S$ is exactly $50\\%$. This matches.\n- The calculated number of complexes remains at $40$. This matches.\n- The reasoning provided (\"plectin is still the limiting factor\") is the correct explanation for why the number of complexes is stable.\n- **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**B. Both $S$ and the number of of integrin–intermediate filament–coupled complexes drop to $0$ because BP230 is required for integrin–laminin binding.**\n- This contradicts Assumption 3, which explicitly states that extracellular binding (integrin-laminin) is unchanged.\n- Our calculation shows that $S$ drops to $40$ (not $0$) and the number of complexes remains at $40$ (not $0$).\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**C. $S$ is unchanged and the number of integrin–intermediate filament–coupled complexes remains at $40$ because collagen XVII (BP180) compensates for BP230’s cytolinker role.**\n- This option introduces a protein, collagen XVII (BP180), that is not part of the defined model. Solutions must be derived solely from the problem statement.\n- It incorrectly claims $S$ is unchanged, whereas our calculation shows a $50\\%$ decrease.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. $S$ decreases by approximately $33\\%$, and the number of integrin–intermediate filament–coupled complexes decreases from $40$ to $20$ due to loss of cooperative stabilization.**\n- The calculated decrease in $S$ is $50\\%$, not $33\\%$.\n- The number of complexes remains at $40$, it does not decrease to $20$. The model does not include any \"cooperative stabilization\" mechanism that would cause already-formed complexes to dissociate upon loss of BP230.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**E. $S$ decreases by approximately $50\\%$, and the number of integrin–intermediate filament–coupled complexes falls to $0$ because plectin requires BP230 to bind keratin.**\n- While the decrease in $S$ of $50\\%$ is correct, the claim that the number of complexes falls to $0$ is false.\n- The reasoning (\"plectin requires BP230 to bind keratin\") contradicts the model's implication that the plectin linkage is primary and independent (Assumptions 1 and 2).\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4899318"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the role of each protein in a complex allows us to predict the consequences when one is lost, a common scenario in genetic diseases.

It is valid. The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nA hemidesmosome (HD) is a multiprotein complex that anchors epithelial cells to the underlying basement membrane. Its structural and mechanical integrity relies on a precise molecular architecture.\n\n1.  **Core Components and Linkages:**\n    *   **Transmembrane Core:** The integrin heterodimer $\\alpha_6\\beta_4$ binds to laminin in the basement membrane.\n    *   **Inner Plaque:** On the cytoplasmic side, a dense plaque is formed by scaffolding and linker proteins. Plectin and bullous pemphigoid antigen 230 (BP230, also known as BPAG1e) are key components of this plaque.\n    *   **Cytoskeletal Anchorage:** The inner plaque connects to the keratin intermediate filament (IF) network, which dissipates mechanical stress throughout the cell and tissue.\n\n2.  **Function of Plectin:** Plectin is a giant protein ($>500$ kDa) of the plakin family. In HDs, it serves as the master organizer and primary mechanical linker. Its C-terminus binds to keratin IFs, and its N-terminal region binds directly to the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin $\\beta_4$ subunit. This plectin-$\\beta_4$ interaction is fundamental for the assembly of the inner plaque and for tethering the entire keratin cytoskeleton to the adhesion site.\n\n3.  **Consequences of Plectin Loss-of-Function:**\n    *   **HD Morphology and Number:** Without plectin, the essential link between integrin $\\beta_4$ and the keratin network is severed. This prevents the proper assembly and stabilization of the HD inner plaque. Consequently, HDs will be rudimentary, appearing smaller, less organized, and with a significantly reduced electron-dense plaque under microscopy. Their overall number and stability will be drastically diminished.\n    *   **Keratin Network Organization:** The keratin IFs lose their primary anchorage points at the cell cortex. Lacking this peripheral tethering, the keratin network is known to retract from the plasma membrane and collapse into disorganized aggregates in the perinuclear region of the cell.\n    *   **Mechanical Resilience:** The disruption of the continuous link from the extracellular matrix (laminin) through the integrin and plectin to the keratin cytoskeleton severely compromises the cell's ability to withstand mechanical stress. The cells will be fragile and prone to detachment under cyclic shear, a phenotype characteristic of blistering diseases.\n\n4.  **Function of BP230 and Potential for Compensation:**\n    *   BP230 is another large plakin protein in the HD inner plaque. Like plectin, it possesses a C-terminal domain that can bind to keratin IFs. However, its N-terminal domain docks differently, primarily associating with the transmembrane collagen XVII (BP180) and the cytoplasmic tail of integrin $\\beta_4$. The plectin-$\\beta_4$ interaction is considered the more robust and primary link for keratin.\n    *   In a plectin-null context, a cell might attempt to compensate by upregulating other functionally related proteins. Upregulation of BP230 is a plausible compensatory response. Increased levels of BP230 could partially re-establish a connection between the keratin filaments and the remaining components of the defective HD plaque.\n    *   **Limitations of Compensation:** This compensation would be inherently incomplete. BP230 cannot fully substitute for plectin's master scaffolding role. The linkage it provides is mechanically and structurally inferior to the plectin-mediated one. Therefore, while BP230 upregulation might modestly improve keratin anchorage and slightly increase the density or size of the defective HDs, the fundamental mechanical weakness would persist. The cell's resilience to shear stress would remain significantly compromised.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Plectin loss converts the keratin intermediate filament network into actin stress fibers at the cell periphery, producing enlarged and more numerous HDs; BP230 cannot influence HDs because it is a transmembrane collagen, so no compensation occurs.**\n-   This option contains multiple fundamental errors. Keratin filaments and actin filaments are completely distinct protein polymers; one does not convert into the other. Plectin loss leads to *fewer and smaller* HDs, not enlarged and more numerous ones. BP230 is an intracellular plaque protein, not a transmembrane collagen (that would be BP180/collagen XVII).\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. Plectin loss yields fewer and smaller HDs with impoverished electron-dense plaques, and keratin intermediate filaments retract toward perinuclear aggregates with reduced cortical anchorage; upregulation of BP230 can partially re-tether keratin to remaining HD plaques and modestly increase HD density, but mechanical resilience remains compromised.**\n-   This option accurately describes the consequences of plectin loss: `fewer and smaller HDs`, `impoverished ... plaques`, and `keratin ... retract[s] toward perinuclear aggregates`. It also correctly proposes a plausible and limited compensatory mechanism: upregulation of BP230 can `partially re-tether keratin`, but `mechanical resilience remains compromised`. This aligns perfectly with the principles derived above.\n-   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. Plectin loss triggers a switch to focal adhesion–dominated attachment that fully compensates cell–BM anchorage; BP230 upregulation further strengthens actin–matrix coupling, restoring normal HD morphology.**\n-   While changes in other adhesion systems can occur, `full compensation` for the loss of HDs by focal adhesions is not expected in this cell type, which relies on HDs for robust static adhesion. More critically, BP230 links to keratin intermediate filaments, not the actin cytoskeleton, so it would not strengthen actin-matrix coupling. `Restoring normal HD morphology` is impossible without the key organizer, plectin.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Plectin loss primarily mislocalizes integrin $\\alpha6\\beta4$ away from the plasma membrane, abolishing laminin binding; BP230 upregulation restores integrin trafficking and fully normalizes HD assembly and function.**\n-   The primary defect of plectin loss is the failure to link the cytoskeleton to the integrin, not the failure of the integrin to traffic to the membrane or bind its ligand. BP230 is not involved in protein trafficking pathways for integrins. Compensation by BP230 is partial, not a `full normalization`.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Plectin loss selectively disrupts desmosomes, leaving HDs and keratin intermediate filaments unaffected; BP230 has no role in this context and cannot provide compensation.**\n-   This misidentifies the primary site of plectin's function. Plectin is a cornerstone of the hemidesmosome. Its loss has a devastating effect on HDs and the linked keratin network. Stating that HDs are `unaffected` is the opposite of the truth. Desmosomes (cell-cell junctions) are structurally and molecularly distinct from hemidesmosomes (cell-matrix junctions).\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4899309"}]}
