It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard biophysical modeling problem based on realistic histological parameters and provides all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe task is to calculate the net increase in membrane surface area due to the presence of microvilli on an epithelial cell's apical domain. We are given the dimensions of the apical domain, the number of microvilli, and their dimensions, modeled as right circular cylinders.\n\nLet the original flat apical surface have an area $A_{flat}$. The problem specifies the domain is a square with side length $s = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Thus, the initial area is $A_{flat} = s^2 = (20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m})^2 = 400\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$.\n\nThe problem defines the net membrane surface area increase, which we will denote as $\\Delta A_{net}$, as the total membrane area with microvilli, $A_{total}$, minus the original flat apical membrane area, $A_{flat}$.\n$$\n\\Delta A_{net} = A_{total} - A_{flat}\n$$\nLet's analyze the geometry. Each microvillus is a cylinder of length $L$ and radius $r$. The givens are the diameter $d = 0.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and length $L = 1.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The radius is $r = d/2 = 0.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} / 2 = 0.05\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. There are $N = 2000$ such microvilli.\n\nThe microvilli are \"attached flush to the apical plane\". This means that for each of the $N$ microvilli, an area corresponding to the circular base of the cylinder is removed from the flat apical plane and is replaced by the microvillus structure. The area of one such base is $A_{base} = \\pi r^2$.\n\nThe new surface area contributed by a single microvillus consists of its top circular cap and its lateral (side) surface. The top cap has an area $A_{top} = \\pi r^2$. The lateral surface area of a cylinder is $A_{lateral} = 2\\pi r L$.\n\nThe total area with microvilli, $A_{total}$, can be expressed as the original flat area, minus the areas covered by the bases of all microvilli, plus the newly added surface area from all microvilli. The newly added surface area for $N$ microvilli is $N \\times (A_{top} + A_{lateral})$.\n$$\nA_{total} = (A_{flat} - N \\times A_{base}) + N \\times (A_{top} + A_{lateral})\n$$\nSince each microvillus is a right circular cylinder, the area of its top cap is identical to the area of its base: $A_{top} = A_{base} = \\pi r^2$. We can substitute this into the expression for $A_{total}$:\n$$\nA_{total} = (A_{flat} - N \\pi r^2) + N (\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi r L)\n$$\nDistributing the $N$ in the second term gives:\n$$\nA_{total} = A_{flat} - N \\pi r^2 + N \\pi r^2 + N (2\\pi r L)\n$$\nThe terms $-N \\pi r^2$ and $+N \\pi r^2$ cancel each other out. This signifies that the surface area of the apical plane covered by the microvillus base is precisely compensated by the new surface area of the microvillus tip. Thus, the total area simplifies to:\n$$\nA_{total} = A_{flat} + N (2\\pi r L)\n$$\nNow we can compute the net increase in surface area, $\\Delta A_{net}$:\n$$\n\\Delta A_{net} = A_{total} - A_{flat} = (A_{flat} + N (2\\pi r L)) - A_{flat}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta A_{net} = N \\times (2\\pi r L)\n$$\nThis result shows that the net increase in area is simply the sum of the lateral surface areas of all the microvilli. The area of the apical domain itself, $s^2$, is not required for this calculation, but it serves to provide context and confirm that the packing of microvilli is not physically impossible.\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this formula:\n$N = 2000$\n$r = 0.05\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n$L = 1.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n\n$$\n\\Delta A_{net} = 2000 \\times (2\\pi \\times (0.05\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}) \\times (1.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}))\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta A_{net} = 2000 \\times (2 \\times 0.05 \\times 1.5) \\pi \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta A_{net} = 2000 \\times (0.1 \\times 1.5) \\pi \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta A_{net} = 2000 \\times 0.15 \\pi \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta A_{net} = 300 \\pi \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2\n$$\nThe problem requires a numerical answer rounded to three significant figures.
