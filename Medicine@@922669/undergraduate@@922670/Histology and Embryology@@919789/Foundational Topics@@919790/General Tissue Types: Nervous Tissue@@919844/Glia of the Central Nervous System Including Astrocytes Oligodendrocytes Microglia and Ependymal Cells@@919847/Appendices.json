The total diameter of the myelinated fiber, $D_{\\text{fiber}}$, is the sum of the inner axon diameter, $D_{\\text{axon}}$, and twice the radial thickness of the myelin sheath, $t$.

It is critical to ensure unit consistency. The lamellar periodicity is given in nanometers (nm), and the final thickness is requested in nanometers.

Therefore, the fraction $\\frac{8750}{39}$ is in its simplest form. This is the second required quantity.\n\nFinally, the problem asks to determine whether the computed value of $N$ lies within the widely reported physiological range of $10$ to $50$ wraps for most adult CNS axons.\nTo perform this comparison, we can approximate our calculated value for $N$:\n$$N = \\frac{8750}{39} \\approx 224.36$$\nThe calculated number of wraps, $N \\approx 224.36$, is substantially greater than the upper limit of the provided typical physiological range of $50$.
