This relationship is given by the equation:\n$$\nd = v \\cdot t\n$$\nwhere $d$ is the distance traversed, $v$ is the constant velocity, and $t$ is the time elapsed. To determine the time required for transport, we rearrange this equation to solve for $t$:\n$$\nt = \\frac{d}{v}\n$$\n\nThe problem provides the following data:\nThe linear distance from the perikaryon (soma) to the neuromuscular junction is $d = 50\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\nThe velocity of fast anterograde transport is $v_{\\text{fast}} = 300\\,\\mathrm{mm/day}$.\nThe velocity of slow axonal transport is $v_{\\text{slow}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{mm/day}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time required for synaptic vesicle proteins to travel from the soma to the axon terminal via fast anterograde transport. Let this time be $t_{\\text{fast}}$.

The ratio is a dimensionless quantity, as the units cancel. This ratio highlights the profound difference in the time scales of these two essential neuronal maintenance processes; slow transport is $150$ times slower than fast transport for delivering cargo over the same distance.

We are asked to determine the change in axial resistance per unit length, $r_i$, and the electrotonic length constant, $\\lambda$, and to interpret the effect on synaptic signal propagation.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\n1.  **Givens**:\n    -   Initial dendrite diameter: $d_{old} = 2\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$.\n    -   Final dendrite diameter: $d_{new} = 1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$.\n    -   The dendrite is modeled as a uniform passive cable.\n    -   Cytosolic resistivity is constant.\n    -   Axial resistance per unit length scales as $r_i \\propto 1/d^2$.\n    -   Membrane resistance per unit length, $r_m$, is constant.\n2.  **Validation**: The problem is scientifically grounded in cable theory, a fundamental model in neurophysiology. The parameters and assumptions are physically plausible for a modeling scenario. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a unique solution for the requested ratios. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n3.  **Verdict**: The problem is valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution.\n\nThe axial resistance per unit length, $r_i$, is the electrical resistance of the cytoplasm (dendroplasm) per unit length of the cable. It is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area, $A$, of the dendrite. Since the cross-sectional area is given by $A = \\pi (d/2)^2 = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}$, $r_i$ is inversely proportional to the square of the diameter, $d$. The problem statement explicitly provides this relationship:\n$$\nr_i \\propto \\frac{1}{d^2}\n$$\nThis can be written as $r_i = \\frac{k}{d^2}$ for some constant of proportionality $k$ that depends on the cytosolic resistivity. We are asked to find the ratio of the new axial resistance, $r_{i,new}$, to the old axial resistance, $r_{i,old}$.\n$$\n\\frac{r_{i,new}}{r_{i,old}} = \\frac{k/d_{new}^2}{k/d_{old}^2} = \\frac{d_{old}^2}{d_{new}^2} = \\left(\\frac{d_{old}}{d_{new}}\\right)^2\n$$\nSubstituting the given values for the diameters, $d_{old} = 2\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ and $d_{new} = 1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$:\n$$\n\\frac{r_{i,new}}{r_{i,old}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{1}\\right)^2 = 4\n$$\nThus, the axial resistance per unit length increases by a factor of $4$ when the diameter is halved.\n\nNext, we determine the change in the electrotonic length constant, $\\lambda$. The length constant is a measure of how far a steady-state voltage signal can propagate along a passive cable. It is defined by the relationship:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_m}{r_i}}\n$$\nwhere $r_m$ is the membrane resistance per unit length and $r_i$ is the axial resistance per unit length. The problem states that compensatory mechanisms keep $r_m$ constant. Therefore, $r_{m,new} = r_{m,old}$. We can now find the ratio of the new length constant, $\\lambda_{new}$, to the old length constant, $\\lambda_{old}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda_{new}}{\\lambda_{old}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{r_{m,new}/r_{i,new}}}{\\sqrt{r_{m,old}/r_{i,old}}}\n$$\nSince $r_{m,new} = r_{m,old}$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda_{new}}{\\lambda_{old}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_{i,old}}{r_{i,new}}}\n$$\nThis is the square root of the reciprocal of the ratio we calculated for $r_i$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda_{new}}{\\lambda_{old}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe length constant is halved when the diameter is halved.\n\nFinally, we interpret the consequences for the steady-state attenuation of an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). In a passive cable, the decay of a steady-state voltage $V$ with distance $x$ from the site of injection is described by the equation:\n$$\nV(x) = V_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $V_0$ is the voltage at the synapse ($x=0$) and $\\lambda$ is the length constant. The attenuation of the signal is determined by the factor $\\exp(-x/\\lambda)$.\n\nA decrease in the length constant from $\\lambda_{old}$ to $\\lambda_{new} = \\frac{\\lambda_{old}}{2}$ means that for a fixed distance $x$ from the synapse to the perikaryon, the exponent term becomes more negative:\n$$\n-\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{new}} = -\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{old}/2} = -2\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{old}}\n$$\nThe voltage attenuation in the thinner dendrite, $V_{new}(x)$, compared to the original dendrite, $V_{old}(x)$, is:\n$$\nV_{new}(x) = V_0 \\exp\\left(-2\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{old}}\\right) = V_0 \\left[\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{old}}\\right)\\right]^2 < V_{old}(x) \\text{ for } x > 0, V_0 > 0\n$$\nThis shows that the voltage decays much more rapidly with distance in the thinner dendrite. Consequently, a small EPSP generated at a distal synaptic site will be more strongly attenuated as it propagates to the perikaryon. The signal arriving at the axon initial segment will be significantly weaker, reducing the efficacy of that distal synapse in contributing to the neuron's firing decision. The dendritic thinning effectively isolates the soma from distal inputs.\n\nThe requested result is the new-to-old ratios for $r_i$ and $\\lambda$.\nThe ratio for $r_i$ is $4$.\nThe ratio for $\\lambda$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 4 & \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4919022"}, {"introduction": "The structure of a neuron is not arbitrary; it is a product of evolutionary optimization, balancing functional demands with metabolic costs.
