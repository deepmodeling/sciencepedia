This requires a robust system for replenishing the synaptic vesicles that are consumed during neurotransmitter release. This first exercise uses a thought experiment involving a hypothetical neurotoxin to explore the critical role of vesicle recycling in maintaining synaptic function, forcing us to consider what happens when this essential maintenance process fails [@problem_id:2351311]. By analyzing the consequences, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the dynamic nature of the presynaptic terminal and the importance of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway.", "problem": "An experimental neurotoxin, which we will call \"Clathroxin,\" is discovered. Its sole mechanism of action is to selectively and completely inhibit the function of the protein clathrin. In an experiment, a cultured neuron is bathed in a solution containing Clathroxin. Subsequently, the neuron's axon is subjected to sustained high-frequency electrical stimulation, designed to repeatedly trigger action potentials. An electron microscope is used to monitor the morphology of a presynaptic terminal of this neuron, while a postsynaptic electrode measures the response to neurotransmitter release.\n\nWhich of the following outcomes most accurately describes the expected structural and functional changes at the presynaptic terminal?\n\nA. The presynaptic terminal will swell significantly, and after an initial period of release, neurotransmission will fail.\n\nB. The presynaptic terminal will shrink, and neurotransmitter release will be strongly and sustainably potentiated.\n\nC. The number of synaptic vesicles stored in the reserve pool within the terminal will increase, but they will be unable to dock at the active zone.\n\nD. The presynaptic terminal will show no significant change in size, but neurotransmitter release will cease immediately upon the first stimulus.\n\nE. The presynaptic terminal will swell significantly, and neurotransmitter release will continue at a high, sustained rate indefinitely.", "solution": "Clathrin is the coat protein required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the principal mechanism by which synaptic vesicle membrane is retrieved from the presynaptic plasma membrane after exocytosis to regenerate functional synaptic vesicles. In a presynaptic terminal, exocytosis of neurotransmitter relies on the vesicle fusion machinery (including SNAREs and synaptotagmin) and does not require clathrin. By contrast, the regeneration of vesicles from the plasma membrane after fusion requires clathrin to form coated pits and coated vesicles; thus, complete inhibition of clathrin specifically blocks synaptic vesicle recycling while leaving initial exocytosis intact.\n\nWhen the axon is driven by sustained high-frequency stimulation, the rate of exocytosis of existing synaptic vesicles increases. Because clathrin is inhibited, endocytic retrieval of vesicle membrane and reformation of synaptic vesicles cannot occur. The readily releasable pool is depleted first, followed by recruitment and fusion of vesicles from the recycling and reserve pools. However, with no clathrin-mediated endocytosis, these pools cannot be replenished. Consequently, the total number of releasable vesicles progressively declines until neurotransmitter release fails. Functionally, a postsynaptic electrode would detect an initial phase of normal responses followed by progressive synaptic depression culminating in failure.\n\nStructurally, every exocytic event adds membrane to the presynaptic plasma membrane. In the absence of clathrin, this added membrane is not retrieved, causing an accumulation of membrane at the terminal. Electron microscopy would therefore reveal a reduction in the number of synaptic vesicles and an increase in presynaptic plasma membrane surface area, often with swollen terminals and possible appearance of abnormal membranous cisternae rather than normal clathrin-coated structures. Thus, swelling of the presynaptic terminal is expected.\n\nThese mechanistic considerations eliminate the alternatives: immediate cessation of release upon the first stimulus does not occur because the existing vesicles can still fuse; sustained potentiation is impossible without recycling because vesicle pools are finite; an increase in reserve pool vesicles is not expected because vesicles are consumed and not replenished; and indefinite high-rate release cannot occur without vesicle regeneration. The outcome that matches both the structural swelling and the functional failure after an initial period of release is therefore the first option.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2351311"}, {"introduction": "Having established the importance of the vesicle cycle, we now turn to the release event itself. Neurotransmitter release is not a deterministic 'all-or-none' event but a fundamentally probabilistic process. This practice introduces the classic binomial model of synaptic transmission, a cornerstone of quantitative neuroscience that connects the presynaptic structure (the number of release sites, $N$) and physiology (the release probability, $p$) to the postsynaptic response [@problem_id:4933300]. By deriving the key statistical properties of the postsynaptic current from first principles, you will learn how to describe and predict the synapse's output in a quantitatively rigorous way.", "problem": "A central excitatory synapse is modeled from a structural perspective as having $N$ independent presynaptic release sites (for example, active zones or release-ready docked vesicles). Upon a single presynaptic action potential invading the terminal, each site can release at most $1$ synaptic vesicle. The following assumptions are made:\n\n- Each site releases a vesicle with probability $p$, independently of other sites and trials.\n- If a vesicle is released from a site, it produces a quantal postsynaptic current of fixed amplitude $q$ (the quantal size). If no vesicle is released, that site contributes $0$ to the current.\n- Across sites and trials, $q$ is constant and postsynaptic noise is negligible.\n\nLet the evoked excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitude be the random variable $A$, defined as the sum of the contributions from all $N$ sites under these assumptions.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions of Bernoulli trials, linearity of expectation, and variance additivity for independent random variables, derive closed-form expressions for the mean EPSC amplitude $\\mathbb{E}[A]$ and the coefficient of variation $\\mathrm{CV}$ of $A$, where $\\mathrm{CV}$ is defined as $\\mathrm{CV} = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(A)} \\big/ \\mathbb{E}[A]$.\n\nExpress your final answer as two symbolic expressions in terms of $N$, $p$, and $q$, reported in the order: first the mean $\\mathbb{E}[A]$, then the coefficient of variation $\\mathrm{CV}$. Do not substitute numerical values.

The derivation will proceed from first principles as requested.\n\nLet $A_i$ be the random variable representing the postsynaptic current contributed by the $i$-th release site, for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, N$. The total EPSC amplitude, $A$, is the sum of the contributions from all $N$ independent sites:\n$$A = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} A_i$$\nAccording to the problem statement, each site $i$ releases a vesicle with probability $p$, resulting in a current of amplitude $q$. With probability $1-p$, no vesicle is released, and the current contribution is $0$. Thus, the random variable $A_i$ takes the value $q$ with probability $p$ and the value $0$ with probability $1-p$.\n\nTo formalize this, we can define a Bernoulli random variable $X_i$ for each site, where $X_i=1$ if a vesicle is released (a \"success\") and $X_i=0$ if no vesicle is released (a \"failure\"). The probability of success is $P(X_i=1) = p$. The current from site $i$ can then be written as $A_i = q X_i$.\n\nFirst, we derive the mean EPSC amplitude, $\\mathbb{E}[A]$. Using the linearity of expectation, the expectation of a sum is the sum of expectations:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[A] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} A_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbb{E}[A_i]$$\nNow, we find the expectation of the current from a single site, $A_i$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[A_i] = \\mathbb{E}[q X_i] = q \\mathbb{E}[X_i]$$\nThe expectation of the Bernoulli random variable $X_i$ is, by definition:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X_i] = (1) \\cdot P(X_i=1) + (0) \\cdot P(X_i=0) = 1 \\cdot p + 0 \\cdot (1-p) = p$$\nSubstituting this back, the expected current from a single site is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[A_i] = qp$$\nSince all $N$ sites are identical and independent, they all have the same expected contribution. TTherefore, the total mean EPSC amplitude is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[A] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (qp) = Nqp$$\n\nNext, we derive the coefficient of variation, $\\mathrm{CV} = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(A)} \\big/ \\mathbb{E}[A]$. This requires calculating the variance of $A$, $\\operatorname{Var}(A)$.\nBecause the release events at the $N$ sites are assumed to be independent, the random variables $A_i$ are independent. For a sum of independent random variables, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances (variance additivity):\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(A) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} A_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\operatorname{Var}(A_i)$$\nWe need the variance of the current from a single site, $\\operatorname{Var}(A_i)$. Using the property $\\operatorname{Var}(cX) = c^2 \\operatorname{Var}(X)$, where $c$ is a constant:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(A_i) = \\operatorname{Var}(q X_i) = q^2 \\operatorname{Var}(X_i)$$\nThe variance of a Bernoulli random variable $X_i$ is given by $\\operatorname{Var}(X_i) = p(1-p)$. This can be shown as $\\operatorname{Var}(X_i) = \\mathbb{E}[X_i^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[X_i])^2$. We already have $\\mathbb{E}[X_i] = p$. The expectation of $X_i^2$ is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X_i^2] = (1)^2 \\cdot P(X_i=1) + (0)^2 \\cdot P(X_i=0) = 1 \\cdot p + 0 \\cdot (1-p) = p$$\nSo, the variance is $\\operatorname{Var}(X_i) = p - p^2 = p(1-p)$.\nThe variance of the current from a single site is therefore:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(A_i) = q^2 p(1-p)$$\nSince all $N$ sites are independent and identically distributed, the total variance of the EPSC amplitude is:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(A) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} q^2 p(1-p) = Nq^2 p(1-p)$$\nNow we can compute the coefficient of variation. The standard deviation, $\\sigma_A$, is the square root of the variance:\n$$\\sigma_A = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(A)} = \\sqrt{Nq^2 p(1-p)} = q\\sqrt{Np(1-p)}$$\nThe coefficient of variation is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean:\n$$\\mathrm{CV} = \\frac{\\sigma_A}{\\mathbb{E}[A]} = \\frac{q\\sqrt{Np(1-p)}}{Nqp}$$\nWe can simplify this expression by canceling $q$ and simplifying the terms involving $N$ and $p$:\n$$\\mathrm{CV} = \\frac{\\sqrt{Np(1-p)}}{Np} = \\sqrt{\\frac{Np(1-p)}{(Np)^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{Np(1-p)}{N^2 p^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-p}{Np}}$$\n\nThus, the required closed-form expressions are $\\mathbb{E}[A] = Npq$ and $\\mathrm{CV} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-p}{Np}}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} Npq & \\sqrt{\\frac{1-p}{Np}} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4933300"}, {"introduction": "The final critical parameter of synaptic transmission is its speed.

In this geometry, the time scale for a molecule to traverse the cleft thickness can be estimated from the one-dimensional diffusion picture.

Then, incorporate the structural effect of junctional folds by modeling their labyrinthine geometry as increasing the effective geometric path length through a tortuosity factor $\\tau>1$, so that the molecule’s characteristic traversal follows the same diffusion law but with an effective path length modified by $\\tau$.\n\nUse the following data, which are physiologically realistic for vertebrate NMJ:\n- Cleft thickness $d=50~\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- ACh diffusion coefficient in extracellular fluid $D=0.5~\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nProceed as follows:\n1.

For the time to traverse the thickness, the diffusion process is effectively one-dimensional along the cleft-normal axis. A fundamental description of diffusion is provided by Fick’s laws and the random-walk relation for mean square displacement. In one spatial dimension, the mean square displacement of a diffusing particle is\n$$\\langle x^{2}\\rangle = 2 D t,$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $t$ is time. A characteristic traversal time $t$ across a distance $d$ along the normal direction can be estimated by setting the mean square displacement comparable to the squared thickness,\n$$\\langle x^{2}\\rangle \\approx d^{2},$$\nwhich gives\n$$t_{\\text{flat}} \\approx \\frac{d^{2}}{2 D}.$$\n\nThis expression is derived solely from the fundamental diffusion relation and does not assume any specialized synaptic geometry beyond the one-dimensional approximation for the transverse cleft crossing.\n\nThe presence of junctional folds increases the geometric complexity of the extracellular space. A common way to model the impact of such geometric complexity on transport is through a tortuosity factor $\\tau>1$, which represents the ratio of the actual, winding path length to the straight geometric separation. In a simple effective-path description, the geometric distance to be traversed is replaced by\n$$d_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\tau d.$$\nUsing the same one-dimensional mean square displacement estimate, the folded-cleft traversal time becomes\n$$t_{\\text{fold}} \\approx \\frac{d_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{2}}{2 D} = \\frac{(\\tau d)^{2}}{2 D} = \\tau^{2}\\,\\frac{d^{2}}{2 D}.$$\nAn equivalent way to view this, often employed in porous media, is that the folds reduce the effective diffusivity to $D_{\\mathrm{eff}} = D/\\tau^{2}$ so that $t_{\\text{fold}} = d^{2}/(2 D_{\\mathrm{eff}}) = \\tau^{2} d^{2}/(2D)$.
