This is achieved using fluorescent probes designed to bind selectively to a specific target. This practice challenges you to apply this principle by predicting the outcome of an experiment based on the molecular differences between two common types of bacteria [@problem_id:2067075].", "problem": "A researcher in a microbiology lab is developing a novel fluorescent staining technique.

Both slides are treated with the new fluorescent probe under optimal binding conditions. After a washing step to remove any unbound probe, the slides are observed under a fluorescence microscope.\n\nAssuming the probe functions as designed, which of the following outcomes is expected?\n\nA.

Lipid A is the lipid component of lipopolysaccharide located in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria; it is not present in Gram-positive bacteria. Therefore:\n1. Identify cell envelope structures:\n- Staphylococcus aureus is Gram-positive, lacks an outer membrane, and does not contain lipopolysaccharide or lipid A; instead it has a thick peptidoglycan layer with teichoic acids.\n- Escherichia coli is Gram-negative, possesses an outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharide, whose hydrophobic anchor is lipid A.\n2. Apply binding specificity:\n- Under optimal binding conditions, a probe with high affinity and specificity for lipid A will bind to surfaces where lipid A is present, i.e., the outer membrane of Escherichia coli.\n- No lipid A target exists on Staphylococcus aureus; thus the probe will not bind specifically to those cells.\n3. Washing step logic:\n- The wash removes unbound probe; only probe that has bound to its specific target remains associated with cells.\n- Consequently, only the Escherichia coli cells retain the probe and will fluoresce under the microscope, while Staphylococcus aureus cells will not fluoresce.\n\nHence, only the Escherichia coli cells will fluoresce.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2067075"}, {"introduction": "Once a specific fluorescent label is chosen, the next critical step is to configure the microscope to detect its signal while ignoring all other light.

This problem explores the physical consequences of a common mistake: using an oil-immersion objective without the required immersion oil.

The imaging is performed with a high-power oil-immersion objective lens, which is designed to be used with a specific immersion oil of refractive index $n_o = 1.518$. The bacteria of interest are located at a physical depth of $d_w = 20.0$ micrometers below the bottom surface of the coverslip.\n\nBy mistake, the microbiologist forgets to add the immersion oil, leaving an air gap between the objective and the coverslip.
