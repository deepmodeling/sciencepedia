The objective is first operated in air and then with immersion oil matched to the cover glass. Use only core optics principles—Snell’s law and the definition of refractive index—to explain how the acceptance of high-angle rays depends on the medium in which the specimen is situated. Starting from those principles, derive the dependence of the objective’s Numerical Aperture (NA) on the specimen-side half-angle and refractive index, where Numerical Aperture (NA) is the dimensionless quantity characterizing angular acceptance at the specimen. Then, for a specimen medium of air with refractive index $n_{\\text{air}} = 1.000$ and immersion oil with refractive index $n_{\\text{oil}} = 1.515$ (both at a central green wavelength used in histology), compute the values of $\\mathrm{NA}$ in air and in oil for the given half-angle $\\theta$, and quantify the fractional increase in $\\mathrm{NA}$ when switching from air to oil, defined as\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{oil}} - \\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{air}}}{\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{air}}}.$$\nUse degrees for all angles.

The law is stated as:\n$$n_1 \\sin(\\theta_1) = n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2)$$\nwhere $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are the angles of the ray with respect to the normal of the interface in their respective media.\n\nIn a typical histology setup, light emanates from a specimen mounted on a glass slide and covered by a glass coverslip ($n_{\\text{glass}}$). Light rays must pass through the coverslip and the medium between it and the objective's front lens.\n\n**Case 1: Air Medium (Dry Objective)**\nThe light ray travels from the glass coverslip ($n_1 = n_{\\text{glass}}$) into air ($n_2 = n_{\\text{air}}$). Since $n_{\\text{glass}} > n_{\\text{air}}$, the ray bends away from the normal. A physical ray cannot have an angle of refraction $\\theta_2 > 90^{\\circ}$. This sets a limit on the incident angle $\\theta_1$. If the angle of incidence in the glass exceeds a certain critical angle, $\\theta_c$, the ray undergoes total internal reflection (TIR) and does not reach the objective. This critical angle is found by setting $\\theta_2 = 90^{\\circ}$:\n$$n_{\\text{glass}} \\sin(\\theta_c) = n_{\\text{air}} \\sin(90^{\\circ}) = n_{\\text{air}}$$\n$$\\theta_c = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{n_{\\text{air}}}{n_{\\text{glass}}}\\right)$$\nApproximating $n_{\\text{glass}} \\approx n_{\\text{oil}} = 1.515$, the critical angle at the glass-air interface is:\n$$\\theta_c = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1.000}{1.515}\\right) \\approx 41.22^{\\circ}$$\nAny ray approaching the coverslip-air interface at an angle greater than $\\approx 41.22^{\\circ}$ is lost. This limits the light a dry objective can accept.\n\n**Case 2: Oil Immersion**\nWhen immersion oil is used, the medium's refractive index $n_{\\text{oil}}$ is matched to that of the glass ($n_{\\text{oil}} \\approx n_{\\text{glass}}$). Therefore, $n_1 \\approx n_2$, and Snell's law implies $\\theta_1 \\approx \\theta_2$. Light rays pass from glass to oil with essentially no deviation. TIR does not occur, and high-angle rays that would have been lost can now enter the objective.\n\n**Numerical Aperture (NA) Derivation**\nThe quantity $n \\sin(\\theta)$ is an optical invariant for a ray crossing parallel interfaces. It connects the angle of a ray in the specimen medium to the angles within the objective's lens system and is the most direct measure of the light-gathering capability. It is therefore logically defined as the Numerical Aperture, $\\mathrm{NA}$, where $n$ is the refractive index of the medium between the specimen and objective, and $\\theta$ is the half-angle of the accepted cone of light.\n$$\\mathrm{NA} = n \\sin(\\theta)$$\n\n**Computations**\nGiven $\\theta = 70^{\\circ}$, $n_{\\text{air}} = 1.000$, and $n_{\\text{oil}} = 1.515$:\n\n1.  **Numerical Aperture in Air ($\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{air}}$)**\n    $$\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{air}} = n_{\\text{air}} \\sin(\\theta) = 1.000 \\times \\sin(70^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.93969$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, $\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{air}} = 0.9397$.\n\n2.  **Numerical Aperture in Oil ($\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{oil}}$)**\n    $$\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{oil}} = n_{\\text{oil}} \\sin(\\theta) = 1.515 \\times \\sin(70^{\\circ}) \\approx 1.42353$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, $\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{oil}} = 1.424$.\n\n3.  **Fractional Increase in NA**\n    $$\\text{Fractional Increase} = \\frac{\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{oil}} - \\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{air}}}{\\mathrm{NA}_{\\text{air}}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{oil}}\\sin(\\theta) - n_{\\text{air}}\\sin(\\theta)}{n_{\\text{air}}\\sin(\\theta)} = \\frac{n_{\\text{oil}} - n_{\\text{air}}}{n_{\\text{air}}}$$\n    $$\\text{Fractional Increase} = \\frac{1.515 - 1.000}{1.000} = 0.515$$\n    As a decimal rounded to four significant figures, this is $0.5150$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.9397 & 1.424 & 0.5150 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4910068"}, {"introduction": "A high Numerical Aperture is just the first step; the true performance of a microscope depends on the entire system, from the wavelength of light to the pixels of the camera.
