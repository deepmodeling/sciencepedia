The principles of volumetric and linear scaling are correctly stated. Therefore, a solution is warranted.\n\nLet $V_0$ be the initial volume of the tissue specimen before dehydration. The dehydration process consists of a sequence of five steps, each inducing a fractional volumetric contraction. Let $V_i$ represent the volume of the tissue after immersion in the ethanol solution of concentration $i\\%$. The fractional volumetric contraction, $\\delta_i$, at each step is defined relative to the volume of the immediately preceding state.\n\nThe volume after the first step ($30\\%$ ethanol) is given by:\n$$ V_{30} = V_0 - \\delta_{30} V_0 = V_0(1 - \\delta_{30}) $$\nThe volume after the second step ($50\\%$ ethanol) is calculated relative to $V_{30}$:\n$$ V_{50} = V_{30} - \\delta_{50} V_{30} = V_{30}(1 - \\delta_{50}) = V_0(1 - \\delta_{30})(1 - \\delta_{50}) $$\nThis sequential reduction continues for all steps.

The spacing between adjacent lines is the reciprocal of this value.\n    $$d_{specimen} = \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{2160} \\, \\mathrm{mm}$$\n    To maintain consistent units for the calculation of magnification, we convert this spacing to nanometers ($nm$), using the given conversion $1 \\, \\mathrm{mm} = 10^6 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$.\n    $$d_{specimen} = \\frac{1}{2160} \\times 10^6 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$$\n\n2.  **Calculate the corresponding size of the feature in the image, $d_{image}$.**\n    The image of the grating lines is captured by a digital camera. The size in the image is the number of pixels measured multiplied by the effective size of each pixel at the detector.\n    The physical pixel pitch is $p_{phys} = 14 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n    The hardware binning factor is $b=2$. Binning combines a $b \\times b$ block of physical pixels into one recorded pixel, so the effective linear size of a recorded pixel, $p_{eff}$, is:\n    $$p_{eff} = b \\times p_{phys} = 2 \\times 14 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 28 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n    We convert the effective pixel size to nanometers ($1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 10^3\\,\\mathrm{nm}$):\n    $$p_{eff} = 28 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$$\n    The measured distance in the image is $N_{grating} = 1500$ pixels. Therefore, the physical size of this feature on the detector is:\n    $$d_{image} = N_{grating} \\times p_{eff} = 1500 \\times (28 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{nm}) = 42 \\times 10^6 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$$\n\n3.  **Calculate the magnification, $M$.**\n    Using the definition of magnification:\n    $$M = \\frac{d_{image}}{d_{specimen}} = \\frac{42 \\times 10^6 \\, \\mathrm{nm}}{\\frac{1}{2160} \\times 10^6 \\, \\mathrm{nm}}$$\n    $$M = 42 \\times 2160 = 90720$$\n    The calibrated magnification is $90720\\times$.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of the Scale Bar Length in Pixels**\n\nNow, we use the calibrated magnification to determine the length of a scale bar in pixels that represents $L_{specimen} = 500 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$ at the specimen level.\n\n1.  **Calculate the size of the scale bar in the image, $L_{image}$.**\n    The image size is the specimen size multiplied by the magnification.\n    $$L_{image} = M \\times L_{specimen} = 90720 \\times 500 \\, \\mathrm{nm} = 45360000 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$$\n\n2.  **Convert the image size to pixels.**\n    The length of the scale bar in pixels, $L_{pixels}$, is the physical image size divided by the effective pixel size, $p_{eff}$.\n    $$L_{pixels} = \\frac{L_{image}}{p_{eff}}$$\n    We have $L_{image} = 45360000 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$ and $p_{eff} = 28 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$.\n    $$L_{pixels} = \\frac{45360000 \\, \\mathrm{nm}}{28 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{nm}} = \\frac{45360}{28}$$\n    Performing the division:\n    $$L_{pixels} = 1620$$\n\nThe required pixel length for the scale bar is exactly $1620$ pixels. The problem asks for the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. The integer $1620$ can be written in scientific notation as $1.620 \\times 10^3$, which already has four significant figures.
