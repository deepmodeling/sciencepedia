For the dissociation reaction, the thermodynamic reaction quotient is:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{R}}a_{\\mathrm{L}}}{a_{\\mathrm{RL}}}\n$$\nUnder the condition of a dilute solution, the activity coefficient of each species is approximately unity ($ \\gamma_i \\approx 1 $), and the activity is given by the ratio of its molar concentration $[i]$ to the standard state concentration, $C^{\\circ}$.
