It is based on the standard pharmacological model of dose-response relationships, specifically the Hill equation, which is derived from the law of mass action with an allowance for cooperativity. The problem provides all necessary parameters and definitions for a unique and meaningful solution. It is free of factual errors, ambiguities, and contradictions. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe goal is to derive an expression for the effect $E$ as a function of agonist concentration $[A]$, maximal effect $E_{\\max}$, half-maximal effective concentration $EC_{50}$, and the Hill coefficient $n_H$.\n\nWe begin with the assumption that receptor binding follows the law of mass action, with cooperativity phenomenologically described by the Hill coefficient $n_H$. This implies that $n_H$ molecules of the agonist $A$ bind to a receptor $R$ in a concerted step:\n$$n_H A + R \\rightleftharpoons A_{n_H}R$$\nThe dissociation constant for this reaction, which we denote as $K_A$, is given by:\n$$K_A = \\frac{[A]^{n_H} [R]}{[A_{n_H}R]}$$\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R]_T$, is the sum of free receptors $[R]$ and agonist-bound receptors $[A_{n_H}R]$:\n$$[R]_T = [R] + [A_{n_H}R]$$\nThe fractional receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, is the ratio of the concentration of bound receptors to the total concentration of receptors:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[A_{n_H}R]}{[R]_T}$$\nTo express $\\theta$ in terms of $[A]$, we first rearrange the expression for $K_A$ to solve for $[R]$:\n$$[R] = \\frac{K_A [A_{n_H}R]}{[A]^{n_H}}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for $[R]_T$:\n$$[R]_T = \\frac{K_A [A_{n_H}R]}{[A]^{n_H}} + [A_{n_H}R] = [A_{n_H}R] \\left( \\frac{K_A}{[A]^{n_H}} + 1 \\right)$$\nNow we can write the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ as:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[A_{n_H}R]}{[A_{n_H}R] \\left( \\frac{K_A}{[A]^{n_H}} + 1 \\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_A}{[A]^{n_H}} + 1} = \\frac{[A]^{n_H}}{K_A + [A]^{n_H}}$$\nThis is the Hill-Langmuir equation.\n\nThe problem states that the relationship between fractional occupancy and effect is linear, and there is no receptor reserve. This means the effect $E$ is directly proportional to the fractional occupancy $\\theta$. The maximal effect, $E_{\\max}$, is achieved when occupancy is complete ($\\theta = 1$). Therefore, the relationship can be written as:\n$$\\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\theta$$\nCombining this with the Hill-Langmuir equation gives:\n$$\\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{[A]^{n_H}}{K_A + [A]^{n_H}}$$\nThe problem defines the half-maximal effective concentration, $EC_{50}$, as the concentration of agonist $[A]$ that produces half the maximal effect, i.e., $E = \\frac{1}{2} E_{\\max}$ when $[A] = EC_{50}$. Substituting this condition into our equation:\n$$\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} E_{\\max}}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{[EC_{50}]^{n_H}}{K_A + [EC_{50}]^{n_H}}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{EC_{50}^{n_H}}{K_A + EC_{50}^{n_H}}$$\nSolving for $K_A$:\n$$K_A + EC_{50}^{n_H} = 2 \\cdot EC_{50}^{n_H}$$\n$$K_A = EC_{50}^{n_H}$$\nThis establishes the relationship between the phenomenological dissociation constant and the experimentally measurable $EC_{50}$. We can now substitute $K_A = EC_{50}^{n_H}$ back into the general dose-response equation:\n$$\\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{[A]^{n_H}}{EC_{50}^{n_H} + [A]^{n_H}}$$\nRearranging to solve for $E$ gives the final derived expression:\n$$E = E_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{[A]^{n_H}}{EC_{50}^{n_H} + [A]^{n_H}} \\right)$$\n\nNext, we compute the effect $E$ for the given parameters: $E_{\\max} = 100\\,\\text{response units}$, $EC_{50} = 30\\,\\text{nM}$, and $[A] = 15\\,\\text{nM}$.\n\nCase 1: $n_H = 1$ (non-cooperative binding)\n$$E = 100 \\left( \\frac{15^1}{30^1 + 15^1} \\right) = 100 \\left( \\frac{15}{45} \\right) = 100 \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) \\approx 33.333...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $E = 33.33\\,\\text{response units}$.\n\nCase 2: $n_H = 2$ (positive cooperativity)\n$$E = 100 \\left( \\frac{15^2}{30^2 + 15^2} \\right) = 100 \\left( \\frac{225}{900 + 225} \\right) = 100 \\left( \\frac{225}{1125} \\right)$$\nSince $1125 = 5 \\times 225$, the fraction simplifies:\n$$E = 100 \\left( \\frac{1}{5} \\right) = 20$$\nExpressing this exact result to four significant figures, $E = 20.00\\,\\text{response units}$.\n\nFinally, we explain how changing $n_H$ alters the sensitivity of the response at sub-$EC_{50}$ concentrations. The derived expression is $E = E_{\\max} \\frac{[A]^{n_H}}{EC_{50}^{n_H} + [A]^{n_H}}$. Let's consider the ratio $x = [A] / EC_{50}$. For sub-$EC_{50}$ concentrations, we have $0  x  1$. The equation for the fractional effect $E/E_{\\max}$ becomes:\n$$\\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{x^{n_H}}{1 + x^{n_H}}$$\nWhen $n_H$ increases (for $n_H  1$), the term $x^{n_H}$ decreases because $x$ is a fraction less than $1$. For example, if $x=0.5$, $x^1 = 0.5$ while $x^2 = 0.25$. This means that for a given agonist concentration below the $EC_{50}$, a higher Hill coefficient results in a lower effect. The system is therefore less responsive, or less sensitive, at these low concentrations. This gives rise to a \"switch-like\" behavior: the response is minimal at low concentrations but then increases very sharply as the concentration approaches the $EC_{50}$. So, while the steepness of the curve around the $EC_{50}$ (a measure of sensitivity in that region) increases with $n_H$, the absolute response at concentrations significantly below the $EC_{50}$ is diminished.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 33.33  20.00 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4944366"}, {"introduction": "A cell's electrical behavior arises from the collective action of thousands of individual ion channels.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two stages as directed by the problem statement: first, calculating the single-channel current, and second, calculating the macroscopic current.\n\nThe first principle states that for an ohmic channel, the single-channel current, $i$, is directly proportional to the electrochemical driving force. This is expressed by the equation:\n$$i = g (V_m - E_{rev})$$\nwhere $g$ is the single-channel conductance, $V_m$ is the membrane potential, and $E_{rev}$ is the reversal potential.\n\nThe given values are:\n- $g = 20\\,\\text{pS} = 20 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{S}$\n- $V_m = -63\\,\\text{mV} = -63 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{V}$\n- $E_{rev} = 0\\,\\text{mV} = 0\\,\\text{V}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the driving force:\n$$V_m - E_{rev} = -63\\,\\text{mV} - 0\\,\\text{mV} = -63\\,\\text{mV} = -0.063\\,\\text{V}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the single-channel current, $i$.
