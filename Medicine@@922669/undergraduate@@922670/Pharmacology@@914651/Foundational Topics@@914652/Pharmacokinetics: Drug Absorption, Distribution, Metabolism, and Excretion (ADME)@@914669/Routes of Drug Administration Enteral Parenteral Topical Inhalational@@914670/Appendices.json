In pharmacology, first-pass metabolism (FPM) refers to the metabolic biotransformation that occurs before a drug reaches the systemic circulation, most prominently in the liver after entry via the portal venous system.

The venous drainage of the rectum is indeed partitioned, with the superior rectal vein draining into the portal system (subject to hepatic FPM) and the middle and inferior rectal veins draining into the systemic circulation (bypassing the liver initially). This distinction is fundamental to understanding the variable bioavailability of rectally administered drugs.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary definitions and quantitative data to arrive at a unique solution.

There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the determination of the fraction of a rectally administered drug dose that bypasses first-pass metabolism (FPM) on its initial passage through the circulatory system.\n\nLet $D$ be the total administered dose. The problem states that absorption is complete, so the total absorbed dose is also $D$. This absorbed dose is partitioned into two pathways based on the venous drainage of the rectum.\n\n1.  A fraction, denoted as $f_{\\text{port}}$, is absorbed into the superior rectal vein. This vein is part of the portal venous system, which drains directly to the liver. Any drug in this fraction is subject to first-pass metabolism in the liver before it can reach the systemic circulation.\n2.  A fraction, denoted as $f_{\\text{sys}}$, is absorbed into the middle and inferior rectal veins. These veins drain into the systemic venous system (specifically, the internal iliac veins, which lead to the vena cava), thus bypassing the liver on the first pass. This fraction is not subject to FPM upon initial absorption.\n\nThe question asks for the fraction of the dose that bypasses first-pass metabolism. By definition, this is the fraction that enters the systemic circulation directly, which is $f_{\\text{sys}}$.\n\nAccording to the principle of conservation of mass, the sum of the fractions Absorbed into the two drainage systems must equal the total absorbed fraction, which is $1$ (since absorption is complete).\n$$f_{\\text{sys}} + f_{\\text{port}} = 1$$\n\nThe problem provides the explicit anatomical split for the venous drainage:\n- The fraction draining via the middle and inferior rectal veins (which corresponds to the systemic, bypass route) is given as $60\\%$.\n- The fraction draining via the superior rectal vein (which corresponds to the portal, FPM-subjected route) is given as $40\\%$.\n\nFrom this information, we can directly assign the values to our defined fractions:\n$$f_{\\text{sys}} = 60\\% = 0.60$$\n$$f_{\\text{port}} = 40\\% = 0.40$$\n\nThese values are consistent with the conservation of mass, as $0.60 + 0.40 = 1.00$.\n\nThe quantity of interest is the fraction of the administered dose that bypasses first-pass metabolism. As established, this is precisely the fraction $f_{\\text{sys}}$.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the administered dose that bypasses FPM is $0.60$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.6}\n$$", "id": "4989269"}, {"introduction": "Beyond macroscopic anatomy, the local chemical environment at the site of administration plays a critical role in drug absorption, especially for routes that rely on passive diffusion across membranes.

The permeability coefficient $P$, absorption surface area $A$, and total apical drug concentration $C_{\\text{total}}$ are constant.\n\nFrom these assumptions, the concentration gradient $\\Delta C$ is effectively the apical concentration of the permeant species, $[\\mathrm{B}]_{\\text{apical}}$.\n$$\\Delta C = [\\mathrm{B}]_{\\text{apical}} - [\\mathrm{B}]_{\\text{basolateral}} \\approx [\\mathrm{B}]_{\\text{apical}}$$\nThe apical concentration of the unionized base is related to the total drug concentration by the fraction $f_{\\mathrm{B}}$:\n$$[\\mathrm{B}]_{\\text{apical}} = f_{\\mathrm{B}} \\cdot C_{\\text{total}}$$\nTherefore, the flux can be written as:\n$$J = P \\cdot A \\cdot (f_{\\mathrm{B}} \\cdot C_{\\text{total}})$$\nThe fold-change in the initial absorption rate is the ratio of the flux in the buffered state to the flux in the unbuffered state, $J_{\\text{buffered}}/J_{\\text{unbuffered}}$.\n$$\\frac{J_{\\text{buffered}}}{J_{\\text{unbuffered}}} = \\frac{P \\cdot A \\cdot (f_{\\mathrm{B, buffered}} \\cdot C_{\\text{total}})}{P \\cdot A \\cdot (f_{\\mathrm{B, unbuffered}} \\cdot C_{\\text{total}})}$$\nSince $P$, $A$, and $C_{\\text{total}}$ are constant, they cancel out, leaving the ratio of the fractions of unionized base:\n$$\\frac{J_{\\text{buffered}}}{J_{\\text{unbuffered}}} = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{B, buffered}}}{f_{\\mathrm{B, unbuffered}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $f_{\\mathrm{B, buffered}}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{B, unbuffered}}$:\n$$\\frac{J_{\\text{buffered}}}{J_{\\text{unbuffered}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{0.4}}}{\\frac{1}{11}} = \\frac{11}{1 + 10^{0.4}}$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically.\n$$10^{0.4} \\approx 2.511886$$\n$$\\frac{J_{\\text{buffered}}}{J_{\\text{unbuffered}}} = \\frac{11}{1 + 2.511886} = \\frac{11}{3.511886} \\approx 3.1321568$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, the fold-change in the initial absorption rate is $3.132$.
