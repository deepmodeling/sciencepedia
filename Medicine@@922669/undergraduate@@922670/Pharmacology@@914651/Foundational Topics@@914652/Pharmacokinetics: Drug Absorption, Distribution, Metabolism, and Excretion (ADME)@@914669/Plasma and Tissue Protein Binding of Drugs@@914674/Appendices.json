The total concentration of the drug, $C_{total}$, is the sum of the concentrations of the unionized form (the free base, $\\text{B}$) and the ionized form (the conjugate acid, $\\text{BH}^{+}$).\n$$C_{total} = [\\text{B}] + [\\text{BH}^{+}]$$\nThe fraction ionized, which we will denote as $f_{ionized}$, is defined as the concentration of the ionized form divided by the total drug concentration.\n$$f_{ionized} = \\frac{[\\text{BH}^{+}]}{C_{total}} = \\frac{[\\text{BH}^{+}]}{[\\text{B}] + [\\text{BH}^{+}]}$$\nTo express this fraction in terms of quantities related to $pH$ and $pK_a$, we must first relate the concentrations of the two forms, $[\\text{B}]$ and $[\\text{BH}^{+}]$. The problem provides the definition for the acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, of the conjugate acid $\\text{BH}^{+}$:\n$$K_a = \\frac{[\\text{B}][\\text{H}^{+}]}{[\\text{BH}^{+}]}$$\nWe can rearrange this expression to solve for the concentration of the unionized base, $[\\text{B}]$:\n$$[\\text{B}] = K_a \\frac{[\\text{BH}^{+}]}{[\\text{H}^{+}]}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[\\text{B}]$ into the equation for $f_{ionized}$:\n$$f_{ionized} = \\frac{[\\text{BH}^{+}]}{\\left(K_a \\frac{[\\text{BH}^{+}]}{[\\text{H}^{+}]}\\right) + [\\text{BH}^{+}]}$$\nThe term $[\\text{BH}^{+}]$ is present in the numerator and in both terms of the denominator, so it can be factored out and cancelled:\n$$f_{ionized} = \\frac{[\\textBH^{+}]}{[\\text{BH}^{+}] \\left(\\frac{K_a}{[\\text{H}^{+}]} + 1\\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_a}{[\\text{H}^{+}]} + 1}$$\nThis expression gives the fraction ionized in terms of $K_a$ and $[\\text{H}^{+}]$. The problem requires the expression in terms of $pK_a$ and $pH$. We use the provided definitions: $pK_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$ and $pH = -\\log_{10}([\\text{H}^{+}])$.

This means that over $97\\%$ of the drug exists in its protonated, conjugate acid form, $\\text{BH}^{+}$. This form carries a positive charge, making it a cation.

The objective is clearly stated without ambiguity.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three stages: first, the derivation of the hepatic clearance, $CL_h$, from mass-balance principles; second, the derivation of the elasticity, $S_{f_u}$, from its definition; and third, the calculation of the required numerical values and their ratio.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for hepatic clearance, $CL_h$, for a well-stirred organ model at steady state. Let $C_{in}$ be the drug concentration in the blood entering the liver and $C_{out}$ be the drug concentration in the blood leaving the liver. The hepatic blood flow is $Q_h$. The rate of drug elimination by the liver is the difference between the rate of drug entering and leaving:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of elimination} = Q_h (C_{in} - C_{out})\n$$\nThe well-stirred model assumes that the drug concentration within the liver is uniform and equal to the exiting concentration, $C_{out}$. The rate of metabolism is determined by the intrinsic clearance, $CL_{int}$, and the unbound drug concentration within the liver, which is $f_u C_{out}$.\n$$\n\\text{Rate of elimination} = CL_{int} f_u C_{out}\n$$\nAt steady state, these two rates are equal:\n$$\nQ_h (C_{in} - C_{out}) = CL_{int} f_u C_{out}\n$$\nWe can solve for $C_{out}$ in terms of $C_{in}$:\n$$\nQ_h C_{in} = Q_h C_{out} + CL_{int} f_u C_{out} = C_{out} (Q_h + CL_{int} f_u)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{C_{out}}{C_{in}} = \\frac{Q_h}{Q_h + CL_{int} f_u}\n$$\nThe hepatic extraction ratio, $E_h$, is the fraction of drug removed from the blood:\n$$\nE_h = \\frac{C_{in} - C_{out}}{C_{in}} = 1 - \\frac{C_{out}}{C_{in}} = 1 - \\frac{Q_h}{Q_h + CL_{int} f_u} = \\frac{(Q_h + CL_{int} f_u) - Q_h}{Q_h + CL_{int} f_u} = \\frac{CL_{int} f_u}{Q_h + CL_{int} f_u}\n$$\nHepatic clearance, $CL_h$, is defined as the product of hepatic blood flow and the extraction ratio:\n$$\nCL_h = Q_h E_h = Q_h \\frac{CL_{int} f_u}{Q_h + CL_{int} f_u}\n$$\nThis is the fundamental expression for hepatic clearance in the well-stirred model.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the sensitivity (elasticity), $S_{f_u}$.

Derivation of the Tissue-to-Plasma Partition Coefficient ($K_p$)**\n\nThe tissue-to-plasma partition coefficient, $K_p$, is defined as the ratio of the total drug concentration in the tissue, $C_t$, to the total drug concentration in the plasma, $C_p$, at equilibrium.\n$$ K_p = \\frac{C_t^{eq}}{C_p^{eq}} $$\nThe unbound fractions are defined as:\n$$ f_u = \\frac{C_{u,p}}{C_p} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f_{u,t} = \\frac{C_{u,t}}{C_t} $$\nwhere $C_{u,p}$ and $C_{u,t}$ are the unbound concentrations in plasma and tissue, respectively. Rearranging gives:\n$$ C_p = \\frac{C_{u,p}}{f_u} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad C_t = \\frac{C_{u,t}}{f_{u,t}} $$\nA core assumption is that unbound drug concentrations are equal across the compartments at equilibrium due to passive diffusion:\n$$ C_{u,p}^{eq} = C_{u,t}^{eq} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for total concentrations into the definition of $K_p$:\n$$ K_p = \\frac{C_t^{eq}}{C_p^{eq}} = \\frac{C_{u,t}^{eq} / f_{u,t}}{C_{u,p}^{eq} / f_u} $$\nSince $C_{u,p}^{eq} = C_{u,t}^{eq}$, we can cancel these terms:\n$$ K_p = \\frac{1/f_{u,t}}{1/f_u} = \\frac{f_u}{f_{u,t}} $$\nThis equation relates the partitioning of the drug between tissue and plasma to the extent of its binding in each compartment.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Mass-Balance ODEs**\n\nWe construct a system of ordinary differential equations for the rate of change of the amount of drug in the plasma, $A_p(t)$, and in the tissue, $A_t(t)$.\n\nFor the tissue compartment: The change in the amount of drug, $dA_t/dt$, is the rate of drug entering minus the rate of drug leaving via blood flow $Q$.\n- Rate in: $Q \\cdot C_p(t)$, where $C_p(t)=A_p(t)/V_p$ is the arterial plasma concentration entering the tissue.\n- Rate out: $Q \\cdot C_{p,ven}(t)$, where $C_{p,ven}(t)$ is the venous plasma concentration leaving the tissue.\n\nIn a perfusion-limited model, the drug in the venous blood leaving the tissue is assumed to be in equilibrium with the drug in the tissue itself. This equilibrium is described by the partition coefficient $K_p$.\n$$ K_p = \\frac{C_t(t)}{C_{p,ven}(t)} \\implies C_{p,ven}(t) = \\frac{C_t(t)}{K_p} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for concentrations ($C_p(t) = A_p(t)/V_p$ and $C_t(t) = A_t(t)/V_t$):\n$$ \\frac{dA_t}{dt} = Q \\left( \\frac{A_p(t)}{V_p} - \\frac{A_t(t)/V_t}{K_p} \\right) = Q \\left( \\frac{A_p(t)}{V_p} - \\frac{A_t(t)}{K_p V_t} \\right) $$\n\nFor the plasma compartment: The change in the amount of drug, $dA_p/dt$, is determined by the exchange with tissue and systemic elimination.\n- Exchange with tissue: The net rate of drug transfer *from* plasma *to* tissue is $dA_t/dt$. Thus, the net rate of transfer *to* plasma *from* tissue is $-dA_t/dt$.\n$$Q \\left( \\frac{A_t(t)}{K_p V_t} - \\frac{A_p(t)}{V_p} \\right)$$\n- Elimination: Elimination occurs from plasma at a rate proportional to the unbound plasma concentration, $C_{u,p}(t)$, with a proportionality constant, the unbound clearance $CL_u$.\n- Rate of elimination = $CL_u \\cdot C_{u,p}(t) = CL_u \\cdot (f_u C_p(t)) = CL_u f_u \\frac{A_p(t)}{V_p}$.\n\nCombining these terms gives the ODE for the plasma compartment:\n$$ \\frac{dA_p}{dt} = Q \\left( \\frac{A_t(t)}{K_p V_t} - \\frac{A_p(t)}{V_p} \\right) - \\frac{CL_u f_u}{V_p} A_p(t) $$\n\nThe complete ODE system is:\n$$ \\frac{dA_p}{dt} = -\\left( \\frac{Q}{V_p} + \\frac{CL_u f_u}{V_p} \\right) A_p(t) + \\left( \\frac{Q}{K_p V_t} \\right) A_t(t) $$\n$$ \\frac{dA_t}{dt} = \\left( \\frac{Q}{V_p} \\right) A_p(t) - \\left( \\frac{Q}{K_p V_t} \\right) A_t(t) $$\n\n**3. Derivation of the Steady-State Volume of Distribution ($V_{ss}$)**\n\nThe steady-state volume of distribution, $V_{ss}$, is a proportionality constant relating the total amount of drug in the body to the plasma concentration at steady state.\n$$ V_{ss} = \\frac{A_{total}^{ss}}{C_p^{ss}} = \\frac{A_p^{ss} + A_t^{ss}}{C_p^{ss}} $$\nAt steady state, the net flux between compartments is zero, so $dA_t/dt = 0$. From the ODE for tissue:\n$$ Q \\left( \\frac{A_p^{ss}}{V_p} - \\frac{A_t^{ss}}{K_p V_t} \\right) = 0 \\implies \\frac{A_p^{ss}}{V_p} = \\frac{A_t^{ss}}{K_p V_t} $$\nThis can be written in terms of concentrations: $C_p^{ss} = C_t^{ss}/K_p$, which is the equilibrium condition. Rearranging for $A_t^{ss}$:\n$$ A_t^{ss} = K_p \\frac{V_t}{V_p} A_p^{ss} $$\nSubstitute this into the expression for $V_{ss}$:\n$$ V_{ss} = \\frac{A_p^{ss} + K_p \\frac{V_t}{V_p} A_p^{ss}}{C_p^{ss}} = \\frac{A_p^{ss} \\left( 1 + K_p \\frac{V_t}{V_p} \\right)}{A_p^{ss}/V_p} $$\nCanceling $A_p^{ss}$ and simplifying:\n$$ V_{ss} = V_p \\left( 1 + K_p \\frac{V_t}{V_p} \\right) = V_p + K_p V_t $$\nFinally, substituting the derived expression $K_p = f_u/f_{u,t}$:\n$$ V_{ss} = V_p + \\left( \\frac{f_u}{f_{u,t}} \\right) V_t $$\n\n### Numerical Implementation\n\nTo find $C_t(t)$ at specific time points, we must solve the initial value problem defined by the derived ODEs with initial conditions $A_p(0)=D$ and $A_t(0)=0$.\n1. For each test case, the parameters $(f_u, f_{u,t}, V_p, V_t, Q, CL_u, D)$ are used.\n2. First, $K_p$ and $V_{ss}$ are calculated directly from the derived formulas.\n3. The ODE system is defined as a function for a numerical solver.\n4. The `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` function is used to integrate the ODE system from $t=0$ to $t=24\\,\\mathrm{h}$. The `t_eval` argument is used to request the solution specifically at $t \\in \\{1, 4, 24\\}\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n5. The solver returns the amounts $A_p(t)$ and $A_t(t)$ at the requested times.\n6. The tissue concentration $C_t(t)$ is calculated by dividing the tissue amount $A_t(t)$ by the tissue volume $V_t$.\n7.
