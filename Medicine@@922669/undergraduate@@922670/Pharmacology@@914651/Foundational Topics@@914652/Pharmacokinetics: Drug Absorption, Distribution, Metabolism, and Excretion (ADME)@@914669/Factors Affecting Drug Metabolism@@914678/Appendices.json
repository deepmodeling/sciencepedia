The solution will proceed.\n\n***\n\nThe hepatic extraction ratio, $E_h$, is the fraction of drug removed from the blood as it makes a single pass through the liver. It is a key parameter in pharmacokinetics, and its value can be derived from the physiological and biochemical parameters provided. The problem specifies the use of the \"well-stirred\" liver model. This model assumes that the drug concentration is uniform throughout the liver and is equal to the concentration in the blood leaving the liver.\n\nLet $C_{in}$ be the concentration of the drug in the blood entering the liver (portal vein and hepatic artery) and $C_{out}$ be the concentration in the blood exiting the liver (hepatic vein). The rate of elimination of the drug by the liver can be expressed from a mass-balance perspective as the product of blood flow and the concentration difference across the organ:\n$$ \\text{Rate of Elimination} = Q_h (C_{in} - C_{out}) $$\n\nThe hepatic extraction ratio $E_h$ is defined as:\n$$ E_h = \\frac{C_{in} - C_{out}}{C_{in}} $$\nRearranging this gives $C_{in} - C_{out} = E_h C_{in}$, and therefore:\n$$ \\text{Rate of Elimination} = Q_h E_h C_{in} $$\n\nAlternatively, the rate of elimination can be described from a biochemical perspective. It is dependent on the intrinsic clearance ($CL_{int}$) and the concentration of drug that is available to the metabolic enzymes. The enzymes can only act on the unbound drug. In the well-stirred model, the concentration of unbound drug within the liver is assumed to be in equilibrium with the unbound concentration in the exiting blood, which is $f_{u,b} C_{out}$.\nThus, the rate of elimination is:\n$$ \\text{Rate of Elimination} = CL_{int} \\times (f_{u,b} C_{out}) $$\n\nBy equating the two expressions for the rate of elimination, we can establish a relationship between the parameters:\n$$ Q_h (C_{in} - C_{out}) = f_{u,b} CL_{int} C_{out} $$\nTo solve for $E_h$, we can divide the entire equation by $C_{in}$:\n$$ Q_h \\left(\\frac{C_{in} - C_{out}}{C_{in}}\\right) = f_{u,b} CL_{int} \\frac{C_{out}}{C_{in}} $$\nRecognizing that $\\frac{C_{in} - C_{out}}{C_{in}} = E_h$ and $\\frac{C_{out}}{C_{in}} = 1 - E_h$:\n$$ Q_h E_h = f_{u,b} CL_{int} (1 - E_h) $$\nNow, we solve for $E_h$:\n$$ Q_h E_h = f_{u,b} CL_{int} - f_{u,b} CL_{int} E_h $$\n$$ Q_h E_h + f_{u,b} CL_{int} E_h = f_{u,b} CL_{int} $$\n$$ E_h (Q_h + f_{u,b} CL_{int}) = f_{u,b} CL_{int} $$\n$$ E_h = \\frac{f_{u,b} CL_{int}}{Q_h + f_{u,b} CL_{int}} $$\nThis is the fundamental equation for the hepatic extraction ratio in the well-stirred model.\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this equation:\n- $Q_h = 90$ $\\text{L}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$\n- $f_{u,b} = 0.30$\n- $CL_{int} = 500$ $\\text{L}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the product $f_{u,b} CL_{int}$:\n$$ f_{u,b} CL_{int} = 0.30 \\times 500 \\, \\text{L}\\,\\text{h}^{-1} = 150 \\, \\text{L}\\,\\text{h}^{-1} $$\nThis term represents the clearance capacity of the liver corrected for protein binding.\n\nNext, we substitute this back into the equation for $E_h$:\n$$ E_h = \\frac{150 \\, \\text{L}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}}{90 \\, \\text{L}\\,\\text{h}^{-1} + 150 \\, \\text{L}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}} $$\n$$ E_h = \\frac{150}{240} $$\n$$ E_h = \\frac{15}{24} = \\frac{5}{8} $$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$ E_h = 0.625 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $0.625$ already has three significant figures, so no further rounding is needed.\n\nFinally, we classify the drug based on its extraction ratio. The given cutoffs are: low extraction for $E_h  0.3$, intermediate for $0.3 \\leq E_h \\leq 0.7$, and high for $E_h  0.7$. Since our calculated value is $E_h = 0.625$, it falls within the range $0.3 \\leq 0.625 \\leq 0.7$. Therefore, the drug is classified as an intermediate extraction drug.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.625}\n$$", "id": "4949299"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of hepatic extraction, it's crucial to understand how a drug's clearance responds to physiological changes.

The analysis will be based on the well-stirred model of hepatic drug elimination.\n\nFirst, we must perform a validation of the problem statement.\nThe givens are:\n1.  The drug elimination mechanism is exclusively hepatic and follows the well-stirred model.\n2.  The relevant parameters are hepatic clearance ($CL_h$), intrinsic clearance ($CL_{int}$), hepatic blood flow ($Q_h$), and plasma fraction unbound ($f_u$).\n3.  Two baseline scenarios are considered for the same drug and individual, with identical $Q_h$ and $CL_{int}$:\n    - Low extraction: $f_u CL_{int} \\ll Q_h$.\n    - High extraction: $f_u CL_{int} \\gg Q_h$.\n4.  A change occurs where $f_u$ is doubled to $2 f_u$, while $Q_h$ and $CL_{int}$ remain constant.\n5.  The fold-change in hepatic clearance is defined as $R \\equiv \\frac{CL_{h}\\,\\text{after}}{CL_{h}\\,\\text{before}}$.\n6.  The objective is to compute $R_{\\text{low}}$ and $R_{\\text{high}}$ for the low and high extraction scenarios, respectively.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, relying on the standard well-stirred model from pharmacokinetics. It is well-posed, with all necessary information and conditions provided to determine a unique solution for the limiting cases described. The language is objective and precise. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe well-stirred model relates hepatic clearance to hepatic blood flow, the unbound fraction of the drug, and the intrinsic clearance of the enzymes. The formula is:\n$$CL_h = \\frac{Q_h f_u CL_{int}}{Q_h + f_u CL_{int}}$$\nThis equation will be the basis for our analysis.\n\nLet $CL_{h, \\text{before}}$ be the hepatic clearance at the baseline state with unbound fraction $f_u$.\n$$CL_{h, \\text{before}} = \\frac{Q_h f_u CL_{int}}{Q_h + f_u CL_{int}}$$\nA physiological change causes the unbound fraction to double. The new unbound fraction is $f_{u, \\text{after}} = 2 f_u$. The parameters $Q_h$ and $CL_{int}$ remain constant. The new hepatic clearance, $CL_{h, \\text{after}}$, is:\n$$CL_{h, \\text{after}} = \\frac{Q_h (2 f_u) CL_{int}}{Q_h + (2 f_u) CL_{int}} = \\frac{2 Q_h f_u CL_{int}}{Q_h + 2 f_u CL_{int}}$$\nThe fold-change, $R$, is the ratio of the clearance after the change to the clearance before the change:\n$$R = \\frac{CL_{h, \\text{after}}}{CL_{h, \\text{before}}} = \\frac{\\frac{2 Q_h f_u CL_{int}}{Q_h + 2 f_u CL_{int}}}{\\frac{Q_h f_u CL_{int}}{Q_h + f_u CL_{int}}}$$\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n$$R = \\frac{2 Q_h f_u CL_{int}}{Q_h + 2 f_u CL_{int}} \\cdot \\frac{Q_h + f_u CL_{int}}{Q_h f_u CL_{int}} = \\frac{2(Q_h + f_u CL_{int})}{Q_h + 2 f_u CL_{int}}$$\nThis is the general expression for the fold-change $R$. Now we will evaluate this expression under the two specified limiting conditions.\n\nCase 1: Low Extraction Baseline ($R_{\\text{low}}$)\nThe condition for a low extraction drug is $f_u CL_{int} \\ll Q_h$. This implies that the term $f_u CL_{int}$ is negligible compared to $Q_h$.\nWe can evaluate the general expression for $R$ in this limit. Let's analyze the numerator and the denominator separately.\nNumerator: $2(Q_h + f_u CL_{int}) \\approx 2(Q_h + 0) = 2 Q_h$.\nDenominator: $Q_h + 2 f_u CL_{int}$. Since $f_u CL_{int} \\ll Q_h$, it is also true that $2 f_u CL_{int} \\ll Q_h$. Thus, $Q_h + 2 f_u CL_{int} \\approx Q_h + 0 = Q_h$.\nTherefore, in the low extraction limit, the fold-change $R_{\\text{low}}$ becomes:\n$$R_{\\text{low}} = \\lim_{f_u CL_{int} / Q_h \\to 0} \\frac{2(Q_h + f_u CL_{int})}{Q_h + 2 f_u CL_{int}} = \\frac{2 Q_h}{Q_h} = 2$$\nFor a low extraction drug, clearance is capacity-limited ($CL_h \\approx f_u CL_{int}$). Doubling the unbound fraction, $f_u$, while keeping $CL_{int}$ constant, effectively doubles the hepatic clearance.\n\nCase 2: High Extraction Baseline ($R_{\\text{high}}$)\nThe condition for a high extraction drug is $f_u CL_{int} \\gg Q_h$. This implies that $Q_h$ is negligible compared to the term $f_u CL_{int}$.\nTo evaluate the limit of the general expression for $R$, it is convenient to divide the numerator and the denominator by the large term, $f_u CL_{int}$:\n$$R = \\frac{2(Q_h + f_u CL_{int})}{Q_h + 2 f_u CL_{int}} = \\frac{2\\left(\\frac{Q_h}{f_u CL_{int}} + 1\\right)}{\\frac{Q_h}{f_u CL_{int}} + 2}$$\nThe condition $f_u CL_{int} \\gg Q_h$ is equivalent to the ratio $\\frac{Q_h}{f_u CL_{int}} \\to 0$. Taking this limit for the expression of $R$:\n$$R_{\\text{high}} = \\lim_{Q_h / (f_u CL_{int}) \\to 0} \\frac{2\\left(\\frac{Q_h}{f_u CL_{int}} + 1\\right)}{\\frac{Q_h}{f_u CL_{int}} + 2} = \\frac{2(0 + 1)}{0 + 2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$$\nFor a high extraction drug, clearance is flow-limited ($CL_h \\approx Q_h$). Since clearance is primarily determined by hepatic blood flow, $Q_h$, which remains constant, it is insensitive to changes in protein binding ($f_u$). Therefore, doubling the unbound fraction does not change the hepatic clearance.\n\nThe computed fold-changes are $R_{\\text{low}} = 2$ and $R_{\\text{high}} = 1$.
