You perform an in vitro experiment at physiological temperature using Human Liver Microsomes (HLM) to characterize its enzyme kinetics. The incubation volume is $1.0$ mL and contains microsomal protein at $0.50$ mg/mL.

We will proceed with the solution by following the requested logical sequence.\n\nThe first step is to determine the intrinsic clearance ($CL_{\\text{int}}$) from the provided Michaelis-Menten parameters. The rate of metabolism, $V$, is described by the Michaelis–Menten equation:\n$$V = \\frac{V_{\\text{max}} \\cdot C}{K_m + C}$$\nwhere $V$ is the reaction velocity, $V_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximum velocity, $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant, and $C$ is the substrate concentration.\n\nClearance is defined as the rate of elimination (in this case, the rate of metabolism, $V$) divided by the substrate concentration, $C$:\n$$CL = \\frac{V}{C}$$\nIntrinsic clearance, $CL_{\\text{int}}$, is the clearance at substrate concentrations much lower than the Michaelis constant ($C \\ll K_m$). Under this condition, the Michaelis-Menten equation simplifies because the denominator $K_m + C$ can be approximated as $K_m$:\n$$V \\approx \\frac{V_{\\text{max}} \\cdot C}{K_m} \\quad \\text{for } C \\ll K_m$$\nSubstituting this simplified expression for $V$ into the definition of clearance gives the expression for intrinsic clearance:\n$$CL_{\\text{int}} = \\frac{V}{C} = \\frac{V_{\\text{max}}}{K_m}$$\nThis is the fundamental relationship for intrinsic clearance based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics. We are also given that the unbound fraction in the in vitro incubation, $f_{u,inc}$, is approximately $1$, which means the clearance calculated is the unbound intrinsic clearance, $CL_{\\text{int,u}}$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of the intrinsic clearance for the in vitro incubation. The given parameters are $V_{\\text{max}} = 1200$ pmol/min and $K_m = 2.0$ $\\mu$M. To ensure dimensional consistency, we convert $K_m$ to units of pmol/$\\mu$L:\n$$K_m = 2.0 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M} = 2.0 \\frac{\\mu\\text{mol}}{\\text{L}} = 2.0 \\frac{10^6 \\text{ pmol}}{10^6 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{L}} = 2.0 \\frac{\\text{pmol}}{\\mu\\text{L}}$$\nThe intrinsic clearance in the incubation volume is:\n$$CL_{\\text{int,inc}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{max}}}{K_m} = \\frac{1200 \\text{ pmol/min}}{2.0 \\text{ pmol/}\\mu\\text{L}} = 600 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{L/min}$$\nThe problem requires this value to be normalized per milligram of microsomal protein. The total amount of protein in the $1.0$ mL incubation is:\n$$\\text{Protein} = 0.50 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}} \\times 1.0 \\text{ mL} = 0.50 \\text{ mg}$$\nThe normalized microsomal intrinsic clearance, which we will denote as $cl_{\\text{int,u}}$, is:\n$$cl_{\\text{int,u}} = \\frac{CL_{\\text{int,inc}}}{\\text{Protein}} = \\frac{600 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{L/min}}{0.50 \\text{ mg}} = 1200 \\frac{\\mu\\text{L}}{\\text{min} \\cdot \\text{mg}}$$\n\nThe second step is to scale this microsomal intrinsic clearance to the whole liver on a per kilogram body weight basis. This process is known as in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE). We use the given scaling factors: microsomal protein per gram of liver (MPPGL) of $40$ mg/g and liver weight per kilogram of body weight of $21.0$ g/kg.\nThe unbound intrinsic clearance for the whole liver, scaled per kg of body weight ($CL_{\\text{int,u,scaled}}$), is calculated as:\n$$CL_{\\text{int,u,scaled}} = cl_{\\text{int,u}} \\times \\text{MPPGL} \\times \\frac{\\text{Liver Weight}}{\\text{Body Weight}}$$\n$$CL_{\\text{int,u,scaled}} = \\left(1200 \\frac{\\mu\\text{L}}{\\text{min} \\cdot \\text{mg protein}}\\right) \\times \\left(40 \\frac{\\text{mg protein}}{\\text{g liver}}\\right) \\times \\left(21.0 \\frac{\\text{g liver}}{\\text{kg body weight}}\\right)$$\n$$CL_{\\text{int,u,scaled}} = 1008000 \\frac{\\mu\\text{L}}{\\text{min} \\cdot \\text{kg}}$$\nTo express this in more conventional units of mL/min/kg, we convert from $\\mu$L to mL ($1$ mL $= 1000$ $\\mu$L):\n$$CL_{\\text{int,u,scaled}} = 1008000 \\frac{\\mu\\text{L}}{\\text{min} \\cdot \\text{kg}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ mL}}{1000 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{L}} = 1008 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min} \\cdot \\text{kg}}$$\n\nThe third and final step is to predict the hepatic blood clearance, $CL_H$, using the well-stirred liver model. This model relates hepatic clearance to hepatic blood flow ($Q_H$), the unbound fraction in blood ($f_{u,b}$), and the unbound intrinsic clearance ($CL_{\\text{int,u}}$). The equation is:\n$$CL_H = Q_H \\cdot \\frac{f_{u,b} \\cdot CL_{\\text{int,u,scaled}}}{Q_H + f_{u,b} \\cdot CL_{\\text{int,u,scaled}}}$$\nNote that the problem states that the blood-to-plasma partition ratio is $1$, so blood clearance is the relevant metric.
