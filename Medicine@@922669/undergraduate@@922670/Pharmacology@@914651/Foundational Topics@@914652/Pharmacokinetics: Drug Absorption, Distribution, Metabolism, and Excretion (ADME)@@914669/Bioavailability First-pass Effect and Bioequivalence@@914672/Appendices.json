This calculation is the first step in characterizing a new drug and is essential for designing appropriate dosing regimens.", "problem": "A single-dose pharmacokinetic study is conducted for a drug known to exhibit linear pharmacokinetics and route-independent systemic clearance. The drug is administered as an Intravenous (IV) bolus and as an immediate-release oral tablet on separate occasions to the same healthy volunteer, with sufficient washout. The following data are obtained: Area Under the Curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity for the IV dose is $AUC_{iv} = 80\\,\\text{mg}\\cdot \\text{h}\\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$ after an IV dose of $D_{iv} = 100\\,\\text{mg}$, and AUC for the oral dose is $AUC_{oral} = 48\\,\\text{mg}\\cdot \\text{h}\\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$ after an oral dose of $D_{oral} = 200\\,\\text{mg}$. \n\nAssume linear pharmacokinetics, identical systemic clearance across routes, and negligible time-dependent changes in physiology between dosing periods.

It contains sufficient and consistent information to determine the absolute bioavailability of the drug, conforming to established principles of pharmacokinetics.\n\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental principle of linear pharmacokinetics. This principle states that the Area Under the plasma concentration-time Curve from time zero to infinity, denoted as $AUC$, is directly proportional to the total amount of drug that reaches the systemic circulation unchanged, $D_{\\text{systemic}}$, and inversely proportional to the systemic clearance of the drug, $CL$. This relationship is expressed mathematically as:\n$$AUC = \\frac{D_{\\text{systemic}}}{CL}$$\n\nFor an intravenous (IV) administration, the entire dose is delivered directly into the systemic circulation. By definition, the bioavailability of an IV dose is $100\\%$, or $1$. Therefore, the amount of drug reaching the systemic circulation is equal to the administered IV dose, $D_{iv}$. The corresponding area under the curve is $AUC_{iv}$. The equation for the IV route is:\n$$AUC_{iv} = \\frac{1 \\times D_{iv}}{CL} = \\frac{D_{iv}}{CL}$$\nThe problem specifies the given values as $D_{iv} = 100\\,\\text{mg}$ and $AUC_{iv} = 80\\,\\text{mg}\\cdot \\text{h}\\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$.\n\nFor an oral (extravascular) administration, only a fraction of the administered dose, $D_{oral}$, reaches the systemic circulation. This is due to potential incomplete absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and/or presystemic metabolism (the first-pass effect) in the gut wall and liver. This fraction is defined as the absolute bioavailability, denoted by the symbol $F$. The amount of drug reaching the systemic circulation is thus $D_{\\text{systemic}} = F \\times D_{oral}$. The corresponding area under the curve is $AUC_{oral}$. The governing equation for the oral route is:\n$$AUC_{oral} = \\frac{F \\times D_{oral}}{CL}$$\nThe problem provides the values $D_{oral} = 200\\,\\text{mg}$ and $AUC_{oral} = 48\\,\\text{mg}\\cdot \\text{h}\\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$.\n\nA critical premise stated in the problem is that the systemic clearance, $CL$, is route-independent. This means $CL$ has the same value for both the intravenous and oral administrations. This allows us to derive an expression for $CL$ from each dataset and equate them.\n\nFrom the IV data, we can express $CL$ as:\n$$CL = \\frac{D_{iv}}{AUC_{iv}}$$\n\nFrom the oral data, $CL$ can be expressed as:\n$$CL = \\frac{F \\times D_{oral}}{AUC_{oral}}$$\n\nEquating the two expressions for the constant $CL$:\n$$\\frac{D_{iv}}{AUC_{iv}} = \\frac{F \\times D_{oral}}{AUC_{oral}}$$\n\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the absolute bioavailability, $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{AUC_{oral}}{AUC_{iv}} \\times \\frac{D_{iv}}{D_{oral}}$$\nThis formula is often expressed as the ratio of the dose-normalized $AUC$ value for the oral route to the dose-normalized $AUC$ value for the IV route:\n$$F = \\frac{AUC_{oral} / D_{oral}}{AUC_{iv} / D_{iv}}$$\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$D_{iv} = 100\\,\\text{mg}$\n$AUC_{iv} = 80\\,\\text{mg}\\cdot \\text{h}\\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$\n$D_{oral} = 200\\,\\text{mg}$\n$AUC_{oral} = 48\\,\\text{mg}\\cdot \\text{h}\\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$\n\n$$F = \\frac{(48\\,\\text{mg}\\cdot \\text{h}\\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}) / (200\\,\\text{mg})}{(80\\,\\text{mg}\\cdot \\text{h}\\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}) / (100\\,\\text{mg})}$$\n\nFirst, we compute the dose-normalized $AUC$ values. The units of the result for each term will be $\\text{h}\\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$.\nFor the oral dose:\n$$\\frac{AUC_{oral}}{D_{oral}} = \\frac{48}{200} \\, \\text{h}\\cdot \\text{L}^{-1} = 0.24 \\, \\text{h}\\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$$\nFor the IV dose:\n$$\\frac{AUC_{iv}}{D_{iv}} = \\frac{80}{100} \\, \\text{h}\\cdot \\text{L}^{-1} = 0.80 \\, \\text{h}\\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$$\n\nSubstituting these values back into the equation for $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{0.24}{0.80} = \\frac{24}{80} = \\frac{3 \\times 8}{10 \\times 8} = \\frac{3}{10} = 0.3$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be reported to four significant figures. As a unitless decimal, this is $0.3000$.\n\nThe computed absolute bioavailability $F = 0.3000$ indicates that $30\\%$ of the drug administered orally reaches the systemic circulation. This value is pharmacologically plausible, as it suggests a significant fraction of the dose ($70\\%$) is lost before reaching systemic circulation, which is consistent with a drug subject to substantial presystemic loss, such as incomplete absorption or a high first-pass hepatic extraction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3000}$$", "id": "4928516"}, {"introduction": "After determining the value of bioavailability, the next logical question is: what physiological processes determine this value? This practice moves beyond simple measurement to a mechanistic understanding of the first-pass effect, one of the primary reasons for incomplete oral bioavailability. You will apply the \"well-stirred\" model of hepatic clearance, a cornerstone of pharmacokinetic theory, to connect fundamental physiological parameters like liver blood flow ($Q_h$) and intrinsic enzymatic activity ($CL_{int}$) to the hepatic extraction ratio ($E_h$) and, ultimately, to the overall bioavailability ($F$) [@problem_id:4928553].

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of pharmacokinetics, specifically the well-stirred model of hepatic clearance. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and definitions to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution. The language is objective and the data are consistent.\n\nThe objective is to determine the hepatic extraction ratio ($E_h$), the hepatic availability ($f_h$), and the absolute oral bioavailability ($F$) for a drug, based on provided pharmacokinetic parameters and the well-stirred model of the liver.\n\nFirst, we determine the hepatic extraction ratio, $E_h$. The well-stirred model assumes that the drug concentration within the liver sinusoids is uniform and equal to the concentration in the hepatic venous blood leaving the liver. At steady state, the rate of drug elimination by the liver must equal the rate of drug presentation to the liver minus the rate of drug leaving the liver.\nLet $C_{in}$ be the drug concentration in the blood entering the liver (portal vein and hepatic artery) and $C_{out}$ be the drug concentration in the blood leaving the liver (hepatic vein). Let $Q_h$ be the hepatic blood flow. The mass balance equation is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Elimination} = Q_h \\cdot C_{in} - Q_h \\cdot C_{out} = Q_h (C_{in} - C_{out})\n$$\nThe rate of elimination is also dependent on the intrinsic clearance ($CL_{int}$) and the unbound concentration of the drug within the liver, $C_{u,liver}$. Intrinsic clearance represents the maximal metabolic capacity of the liver enzymes, independent of blood flow. The rate of elimination is given by:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Elimination} = CL_{int} \\cdot C_{u,liver}\n$$\nIn the well-stirred model, the unbound concentration throughout the liver is assumed to be in equilibrium with the unbound concentration in the exiting blood. Let $f_u$ be the unbound fraction in blood. Therefore:\n$$\nC_{u,liver} = C_{u,out} = f_u \\cdot C_{out}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the rate of elimination expression gives:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Elimination} = CL_{int} \\cdot f_u \\cdot C_{out}\n$$\nBy equating the two expressions for the rate of elimination, we establish the core relationship of the model:\n$$\nQ_h (C_{in} - C_{out}) = CL_{int} \\cdot f_u \\cdot C_{out}\n$$\nThe hepatic extraction ratio, $E_h$, is defined as the fraction of the drug entering the liver that is eliminated during one pass:\n$$\nE_h = \\frac{C_{in} - C_{out}}{C_{in}}\n$$\nFrom this definition, we can write $C_{in} - C_{out} = E_h \\cdot C_{in}$. We can also express $C_{out}$ in terms of $C_{in}$ and $E_h$:\n$$\n\\frac{C_{out}}{C_{in}} = 1 - E_h \\implies C_{out} = C_{in} (1 - E_h)\n$$\nSubstituting these relationships into the mass balance equation:\n$$\nQ_h (E_h \\cdot C_{in}) = CL_{int} \\cdot f_u \\cdot [C_{in} (1 - E_h)]\n$$\nThe term $C_{in}$ cancels from both sides, leaving an equation for $E_h$ that depends only on the physiological and drug-specific parameters:\n$$\nQ_h \\cdot E_h = f_u \\cdot CL_{int} \\cdot (1 - E_h)\n$$\n$$\nQ_h \\cdot E_h = f_u \\cdot CL_{int} - (f_u \\cdot CL_{int}) \\cdot E_h\n$$\n$$\nE_h \\cdot (Q_h + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}) = f_u \\cdot CL_{int}\n$$\nSolving for $E_h$:\n$$\nE_h = \\frac{f_u \\cdot CL_{int}}{Q_h + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}}\n$$\nWe are given $Q_h = 90\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$, $f_u = 0.1$, and $CL_{int} = 200\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$. We substitute these values into the derived equation:\n$$\nf_u \\cdot CL_{int} = 0.1 \\cdot 200\\,\\mathrm{L/h} = 20\\,\\mathrm{L/h}\n$$\n$$\nE_h = \\frac{20\\,\\mathrm{L/h}}{90\\,\\mathrm{L/h} + 20\\,\\mathrm{L/h}} = \\frac{20}{110} = \\frac{2}{11}\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the hepatic availability, $f_h$. This is the fraction of drug that enters the liver and escapes elimination, thereby reaching the systemic circulation. It is the complement of the hepatic extraction ratio:\n$$\nf_h = 1 - E_h\n$$\nUsing the calculated value of $E_h$:\n$$\nf_h = 1 - \\frac{2}{11} = \\frac{11}{11} - \\frac{2}{11} = \\frac{9}{11}\n$$\n\nFinally, we determine the absolute oral bioavailability, $F$. Bioavailability is the fraction of an administered dose of unchanged drug that reaches the systemic circulation. For an oral dose, the drug must overcome several barriers, and the total bioavailability is the product of the fractions that pass each barrier. The standard decomposition is given by:\n$$\nF = f_a \\cdot f_g \\cdot f_h\n$$\nwhere $f_a$ is the fraction absorbed from the gastrointestinal lumen, $f_g$ is the fraction that escapes metabolism in the gut wall, and $f_h$ is the hepatic availability.\nWe are given $f_a = 0.9$ and $f_g = 0.8$. We use our calculated value for $f_h$.\n$$\nf_a = 0.9 = \\frac{9}{10}\n$$\n$$\nf_g = 0.8 = \\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4}{5}\n$$\n$$\nf_h = \\frac{9}{11}\n$$\nNow we calculate the product:\n$$\nF = \\frac{9}{10} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{9}{11} = \\frac{9 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 9}{10 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11} = \\frac{324}{550}\n$$\nTo express this as an exact fraction in simplest form, we find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator. Both are divisible by $2$:\n$$\nF = \\frac{324 \\div 2}{550 \\div 2} = \\frac{162}{275}\n$$\nThe prime factorization of the numerator is $162 = 2 \\cdot 3^4$. The prime factorization of the denominator is $275 = 5^2 \\cdot 11$. As there are no common prime factors, the fraction is in its simplest form.\n\nThe required values are $E_h = \\frac{2}{11}$, $f_h = \\frac{9}{11}$, and $F = \\frac{162}{275}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{11}  \\frac{9}{11}  \\frac{162}{275} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4928553"}, {"introduction": "The principles of bioavailability have profound implications for public health, particularly in the approval of generic drugs.
