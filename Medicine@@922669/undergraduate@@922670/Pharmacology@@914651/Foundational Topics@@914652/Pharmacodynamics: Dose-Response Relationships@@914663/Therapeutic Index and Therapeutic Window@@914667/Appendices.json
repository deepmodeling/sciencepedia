By core definitions, the median effective dose $ED_{50}$ is the dose at which $50$ out of $100$ subjects would show the therapeutic effect, and the median toxic dose $TD_{50}$ is the dose at which $50$ out of $100$ subjects would show the toxicity.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of pharmacology and biostatistics, well-posed with a clear and consistent set of definitions and constraints, and objective in its formulation. The problem contains all necessary information to construct the required dataset and perform the subsequent calculations.\n\n### Task A: Dataset Construction\n\nThe problem requires the construction of a hypothetical dataset of individual effective and toxic threshold doses, $\\{(E_i, T_i)\\}_{i=1}^{100}$, for a population of $100$ subjects. This dataset must satisfy three conditions:\n1.  The median effective dose is $ED_{50}=5\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. By definition, this means exactly $50$ subjects have an effective threshold $E_i \\leq 5\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ and $50$ subjects have $E_i  5\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n2.  The median toxic dose is $TD_{50}=20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. By definition, this means exactly $50$ subjects have a toxic threshold $T_i \\leq 20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ and $50$ subjects have $T_i  20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n3.  The dataset must be scientifically plausible, which requires $T_i \\geq E_i$ for every subject $i=1, \\dots, 100$.\n\nTo construct such a dataset, we can partition the $100$ subjects into four groups based on their threshold values relative to the medians:\n-   Group 1 ($G_1$): Subjects with $E_i \\leq 5\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ and $T_i \\leq 20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n-   Group 2 ($G_2$): Subjects with $E_i \\leq 5\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ and $T_i  20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n-   Group 3 ($G_3$): Subjects with $E_i  5\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ and $T_i \\leq 20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n-   Group 4 ($G_4$): Subjects with $E_i  5\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ and $T_i  20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n\nLet $N_1, N_2, N_3, N_4$ be the number of subjects in each respective group. The conditions impose the following constraints on these numbers:\n-   $N_1 + N_2 = 50$ (for $ED_{50}=5\\,\\mathrm{mg}$)\n-   $N_1 + N_3 = 50$ (for $TD_{50}=20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$)\n-   $N_1 + N_2 + N_3 + N_4 = 100$ (total subjects)\n\nFrom these equations, we can deduce that $N_2 = N_3$ and $N_4 = N_1$. We can choose any value for $N_1$ between $0$ and $50$, provided we can satisfy the condition $T_i \\geq E_i$. Let's select $N_1 = 40$.\nThis implies:\n-   $N_2 = 50 - N_1 = 50 - 40 = 10$.\n-   $N_3 = 50 - N_1 = 50 - 40 = 10$.\n-   $N_4 = N_1 = 40$.\nThe total number of subjects is $40 + 10 + 10 + 40 = 100$.\n\nNow we define explicit threshold values for the subjects in each group that satisfy all conditions, including $T_i \\geq E_i$.\n\n-   **For the $N_1 = 40$ subjects in Group 1 ($i=1, \\dots, 40$):**\n    We need $E_i \\leq 5\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ and $E_i \\leq T_i \\leq 20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n    Let's set $E_i = 4\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ and $T_i = 18\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ for all subjects in this group. This satisfies $4 \\leq 18$, $4 \\leq 5$, and $18 \\leq 20$.\n\n-   **For the $N_2 = 10$ subjects in Group 2 ($i=41, \\dots, 50$):**\n    We need $E_i \\leq 5\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ and $T_i  20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. The condition $T_i \\geq E_i$ is easily met.\n    Let's set $E_i = 3\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ and $T_i = 25\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ for all subjects in this group. This satisfies $3 \\leq 25$, $3 \\leq 5$, and $25  20$.\n\n-   **For the $N_3 = 10$ subjects in Group 3 ($i=51, \\dots, 60$):**\n    We need $5\\,\\mathrm{mg}  E_i \\leq T_i \\leq 20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n    Let's set $E_i = 8\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ and $T_i = 15\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ for all subjects in this group.

The problem states that the therapeutic index is defined as the ratio of $TD_{50}$ to $ED_{50}$. The given and verified values are:\n$$ED_{50} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n$$TD_{50} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\nTherefore, the therapeutic index is:\n$$TI = \\frac{TD_{50}}{ED_{50}} = \\frac{20\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{5\\,\\mathrm{mg}} = 4$$\n\nNext, we must estimate the fraction of subjects who would exhibit toxicity at a single oral dose of $10\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. This requires using the additional modeling assumption.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\nThe core principle of a quantal dose-response relationship is that an individual $i$ shows the response (in this case, toxicity) at a given dose $D$ if and only if their individual tolerance threshold $T_i$ is less than or equal to that dose, i.e., $T_i \\leq D$.\n\nThe fraction of the population that exhibits toxicity at dose $D$ is therefore the probability that a randomly selected subject from the population has a toxic threshold $T \\leq D$. This is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the toxic thresholds, evaluated at the dose $D$.\n$$ \\text{Fraction with toxicity at dose } D = P(T \\leq D) $$\n\nThe problem states that we should model the population distribution of toxic thresholds $T$ as a normal tolerance distribution with mean $\\mu=20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ and standard deviation $\\sigma=5\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. We can write this as $T \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ with $\\mu=20$ and $\\sigma=5$.\n\nWe need to compute the fraction of subjects exhibiting toxicity at a dose of $D = 10\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. This corresponds to calculating the probability $P(T \\leq 10)$.\n\nTo compute this probability for a normal distribution, we first standardize the variable $T$ by transforming it into the standard normal variable $Z$, which has a mean of $0$ and a standard deviation of $1$. The transformation is:\n$$ Z = \\frac{T - \\mu}{\\sigma} $$\nApplying this transformation to our inequality:\n$$ P(T \\leq 10) = P\\left(\\frac{T - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\leq \\frac{10 - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the given values for $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$:\n$$ P\\left(Z \\leq \\frac{10 - 20}{5}\\right) = P\\left(Z \\leq \\frac{-10}{5}\\right) = P(Z \\leq -2) $$\nThis probability is the value of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, commonly denoted by $\\Phi(z)$, at $z=-2$.\n$$ \\text{Fraction with toxicity} = \\Phi(-2) $$\n\n**Computation**\nThe value of $\\Phi(-2)$ can be found using standard normal distribution tables or a computational tool. The value is approximately $0.0227501...$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\Phi(-2) \\approx 0.02275 $$\nThus, the estimated fraction of subjects who would exhibit toxicity at a single oral dose of $10\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ is $0.02275$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.02275}$$", "id": "4994579"}, {"introduction": "While the therapeutic index is a useful starting point, clinical practice relies more on the therapeutic window—a range of plasma concentrations that optimize efficacy while minimizing toxicity.

A solution can be derived from first principles.\n\n**Solution Derivation:**\nThe problem states that the pharmacodynamic and toxicodynamic responses follow a monotonic saturable one-site binding model with a Hill coefficient of $1$. This corresponds to the simple Emax model, which is mathematically equivalent to the Michaelis-Menten equation.\n\nThe equation for the efficacy response, $E$, as a function of the drug concentration, $C$, is:\n$$E(C) = \\frac{E_{max} \\cdot C}{EC_{50} + C}$$\nSimilarly, the equation for the toxicity response, $T$, as a function of the drug concentration, $C$, is:\n$$T(C) = \\frac{T_{max} \\cdot C}{TC_{50} + C}$$\n\nThe provided parameters are: $E_{max} = 100$, $EC_{50} = 2$ mg/L, $T_{max} = 100$, and $TC_{50} = 8$ mg/L.\n\nFirst, we determine the minimal effective concentration, $C_{eff}$. This is defined as the smallest concentration for which the efficacy $E$ is greater than or equal to $50$. Since the function $E(C)$ is monotonically increasing with $C$, this is the concentration at which $E(C)$ is exactly equal to $50$.\n$$50 = \\frac{100 \\cdot C_{eff}}{2 + C_{eff}}$$\nOne can immediately recognize that an effect of $50$ is exactly half of the maximal effect $E_{max} = 100$. By definition, the concentration that produces a half-maximal effect is the $EC_{50}$. Therefore, $C_{eff}$ must be equal to $EC_{50}$. We can verify this algebraically:\n$$50 \\cdot (2 + C_{eff}) = 100 \\cdot C_{eff}$$\n$$100 + 50 \\cdot C_{eff} = 100 \\cdot C_{eff}$$\n$$100 = (100 - 50) \\cdot C_{eff}$$\n$$100 = 50 \\cdot C_{eff}$$\n$$C_{eff} = \\frac{100}{50} = 2$$\nSo, the minimal effective concentration is $C_{eff} = 2$ mg/L.\n\nNext, we determine the maximal non-toxic concentration, $C_{tox}$. This is defined as the largest concentration for which the toxicity $T$ is less than $30$. Since the function $T(C)$ is also monotonically increasing with $C$, the boundary of this condition is the concentration at which $T(C)$ is exactly equal to $30$.\n$$30 = \\frac{100 \\cdot C_{tox}}{8 + C_{tox}}$$\nWe solve this equation for $C_{tox}$:\n$$30 \\cdot (8 + C_{tox}) = 100 \\cdot C_{tox}$$\n$$240 + 30 \\cdot C_{tox} = 100 \\cdot C_{tox}$$\n$$240 = (100 - 30) \\cdot C_{tox}$$\n$$240 = 70 \\cdot C_{tox}$$\n$$C_{tox} = \\frac{240}{70} = \\frac{24}{7}$$\nSo, the maximal non-toxic concentration is $C_{tox} = \\frac{24}{7}$ mg/L.\n\nFinally, we calculate the therapeutic window width, which is defined as the difference $C_{tox} - C_{eff}$.\n$$\\text{Width} = C_{tox} - C_{eff} = \\frac{24}{7} - 2$$\nTo perform the subtraction, we use a common denominator:\n$$\\text{Width} = \\frac{24}{7} - \\frac{14}{7} = \\frac{24 - 14}{7} = \\frac{10}{7}$$\nThe problem requests the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The average concentration is then:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{avg},\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,\\mathrm{ss}}}{\\tau} = \\frac{D}{kV\\tau}\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Numerical Calculations\nFirst, we substitute the given values into the derived expressions.\n- Dose: $D=400\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n- Volume of distribution: $V=40\\,\\mathrm{L}$\n- Elimination rate constant: $k=0.2\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n- Dosing interval: $\\tau=8\\,\\mathrm{h}$\n- Concentration increase per dose: $\\Delta C = D/V = 400\\,\\mathrm{mg} / 40\\,\\mathrm{L} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\n- The dimensionless product $k\\tau$ is: $k\\tau = (0.2\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1})(8\\,\\mathrm{h}) = 1.6$.\n- The accumulation factor denominator is $1-\\exp(-k\\tau) = 1-\\exp(-1.6)$.\n\nNow, we compute the steady-state concentrations:\n$$\nC_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}}{1-\\exp(-1.6)} \\approx \\frac{10}{1-0.201897} \\approx \\frac{10}{0.798103} \\approx 12.5295\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}\n$$\n$$\nC_{\\min,\\mathrm{ss}} = C_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}} \\exp(-k\\tau) \\approx (12.5295\\,\\mathrm{mg/L})\\exp(-1.6) \\approx 12.5295 \\times 0.201897 \\approx 2.5295\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}\n$$\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{avg},\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{400\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{(0.2\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1})(40\\,\\mathrm{L})(8\\,\\mathrm{h})} = \\frac{400}{64}\\,\\mathrm{mg/L} = 6.25\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Calculation of Fluctuation ($\\Phi$) and Safety Index ($S$)\nThe peak–trough fluctuation $\\Phi$ is:\n$$\n\\Phi = \\frac{C_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}}-C_{\\min,\\mathrm{ss}}}{C_{\\mathrm{avg},\\mathrm{ss}}} = \\frac{12.5295 - 2.5295}{6.25}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg/L}}{\\mathrm{mg/L}} = \\frac{10}{6.25} = 1.6\n$$\nAnalytically, $\\Phi = \\frac{D/V}{D/(kV\\tau)} = k\\tau$, which matches our calculation: $k\\tau = 1.6$.\n\nThe dimensionless safety index $S$ is defined as:\n$$\nS \\equiv \\min\\!\\left(\\frac{C_{\\min,\\mathrm{ss}}}{C_{\\mathrm{eff}}},\\,\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{tox}}}{C_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}}}\\right)\n$$\nWe use the computed steady-state concentrations and the given therapeutic window limits:\n- $C_{\\mathrm{eff}}=3\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$\n- $C_{\\mathrm{tox}}=15\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$\n\nWe compute the two ratios:\n$$\n\\text{Ratio 1:} \\quad \\frac{C_{\\min,\\mathrm{ss}}}{C_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{2.5295\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}}{3\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}} \\approx 0.84317\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Ratio 2:} \\quad \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{tox}}}{C_{\\max,\\mathrm{ss}}} = \\frac{15\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}}{12.5295\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}} \\approx 1.19717\n$$\nThe safety index $S$ is the minimum of these two values:\n$$\nS = \\min(0.84317, 1.19717) = 0.84317\n$$\nThe value $S  1$ indicates that the regimen is not entirely within the therapeutic window. Specifically, because the minimum is given by the first ratio, the trough concentration $C_{\\min,\\mathrm{ss}}$ falls below the minimum effective concentration $C_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n\nRounding the final answer to three significant figures gives $0.843$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.843}$$", "id": "4994590"}]}
