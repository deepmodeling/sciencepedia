In drug nomenclature, the salt form is labeled with the suffix “hydrochloride,” while the underlying neutral molecule is referred to as the “free base.” For dose equivalence between salt and base, the chemically relevant fundamental base is the stoichiometric relationship between moles and mass via molecular weight, and the observation that a 1:1 salt contains one mole of base per mole of salt. The molecular weight is defined as the mass per mole, and the number of moles is obtained by dividing the mass by the molecular weight. \n\nConsider a monoprotic base with molecular weight $M_b=300$ g/mol and its corresponding hydrochloride salt with molecular weight $M_s=336$ g/mol.

It is scientifically grounded in the fundamental principles of chemistry, specifically stoichiometry and the mole concept. It is well-posed, providing all necessary data and definitions for a unique solution. The given values are realistic and internally consistent.\n\nThe core principle for solving this problem is the conservation of moles in a chemical structure. The problem states that the drug is a $1:1$ hydrochloride salt, meaning that one mole of the salt compound contains exactly one mole of the free base molecule and one mole of hydrogen chloride.\n\nLet $n_s$ be the number of moles of the hydrochloride salt and $n_b$ be the number of moles of the free base. Due to the specified $1:1$ stoichiometry, the number of moles of the salt administered is equal to the number of moles of the free base contained within that dose.\n$$n_s = n_b$$\nThe number of moles, $n$, of a substance is defined as its mass, $m$, divided by its molecular weight, $M$.\n$$n = \\frac{m}{M}$$\nWe can express the number of moles for the salt and the base using this relationship. Let $m_s$ be the mass of the salt, $M_s$ be the molecular weight of the salt, $m_b$ be the mass of the base, and $M_b$ be the molecular weight of the base.\n$$n_s = \\frac{m_s}{M_s}$$\n$$n_b = \\frac{m_b}{M_b}$$\nBy substituting these expressions into our molar equality, we get:\n$$\\frac{m_s}{M_s} = \\frac{m_b}{M_b}$$\nThe problem asks for the base-equivalent dose, which is the mass of the free base, $m_b$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $m_b$:\n$$m_b = m_s \\times \\frac{M_b}{M_s}$$\nThe ratio $\\frac{M_b}{M_s}$ is a dimensionless quantity often referred to as the salt factor, which converts a mass of the salt form to the equivalent mass of the free base.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nMass of the hydrochloride salt, $m_s = 50$ mg.\nMolecular weight of the free base, $M_b = 300$ g/mol.\nMolecular weight of the hydrochloride salt, $M_s = 336$ g/mol.\n\nNow we substitute these values into the equation for $m_b$. The units of molecular weight (g/mol) cancel, so the resulting unit for $m_b$ will be the same as that for $m_s$ (mg), which is consistent with the problem's requirement.\n$$m_b = 50 \\, \\text{mg} \\times \\frac{300}{336}$$\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$m_b = 50 \\times \\frac{75}{84} = 50 \\times \\frac{25}{28}$$\n$$m_b = \\frac{1250}{28} = \\frac{625}{14}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$m_b \\approx 44.64285714 \\, \\text{mg}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

Understanding the purity of an enantiomeric mixture is therefore crucial.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of stereochemistry and pharmacology, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objective in its language. The problem consists of two parts: a calculation of mole fractions from a given enantiomeric excess and an explanation of the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) nomenclature for stereoisomers.\n\nPart 1: Calculation of Mole Fractions\n\nLet $x_S$ and $x_R$ represent the mole fractions of the $S$- and $R$-enantiomers, respectively.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the sum of the mole fractions of the two enantiomers must equal 1. This provides our first equation:\n$$x_S + x_R = 1 \\quad (1)$$\n\nThe enantiomeric excess, denoted as $ee$, is given as 40%, which is equivalent to a fractional value of 0.40. The problem states that this is an excess of the $S$-enantiomer, which signifies that $x_S > x_R$. The enantiomeric excess is defined as the signed difference between the mole fractions, which in this case is:\n$$ee = x_S - x_R$$\nSubstituting the given value, we obtain our second equation:\n$$x_S - x_R = 0.40 \\quad (2)$$\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n1.  $x_S + x_R = 1$\n2.  $x_S - x_R = 0.40$\n\nTo solve for $x_S$, we can add equation (1) and equation (2):\n$$(x_S + x_R) + (x_S - x_R) = 1 + 0.40$$\n$$2x_S = 1.40$$\n$$x_S = \\frac{1.40}{2}$$\n$$x_S = 0.70$$\n\nTo solve for $x_R$, we can substitute the value of $x_S$ into equation (1):\n$$0.70 + x_R = 1$$\n$$x_R = 1 - 0.70$$\n$$x_R = 0.30$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be presented as decimals rounded to 4 significant figures. Therefore, the mole fractions are:\n$x_S = 0.7000$\n$x_R = 0.3000$\n\nThe final result is presented in the order $(x_S, x_R)$.\n\nPart 2: INN Nomenclature for Stereoisomers\n\nThe International Nonproprietary Name (INN) system, managed by the World Health Organization (WHO), provides specific guidelines for naming pharmaceutical substances to ensure clarity and safety. Distinguishing between stereoisomers (enantiomers and diastereomers) is of paramount importance because they can exhibit significantly different pharmacological, pharmacokinetic, and toxicological profiles.\n\n1.  **Racemic Mixtures**: A racemic mixture is an equimolar ($1:1$) mixture of two enantiomers. The INN system typically identifies a racemate by using the prefix `rac-` before the drug name. For example, the racemic mixture of modafinil is named `rac-modafinil`. In many cases, if a drug was first developed and marketed as a racemate, its INN may not have a prefix at all (e.g., `ibuprofen`, `ketoprofen`), with the racemate form being implied unless otherwise specified.\n\n2.  **Enantiopure Products**: When a single enantiomer is developed as a drug, it is assigned a distinct INN to differentiate it from the racemate. The WHO policy has evolved, but the primary goal is to create a name that is unambiguously linked to a single stereoisomer.\n    *   **Prefixes for Absolute Configuration**: The most systematic and modern approach is to use prefixes that relate to the absolute configuration ($R$ or $S$). The prefix `es-` is used for the $S$-enantiomer, and the prefix `ar-` is used for the $R$-enantiomer. A prominent example is `citalopram` (the racemate) and its active enantiomer, `escitalopram` ($S$-citalopram). Another example is `ketamine` (racemate), for which the single enantiomers are named `esketamine` ($S$-ketamine) and `arketamine` ($R$-ketamine).\n    *   **Prefixes for Optical Rotation**: An older, less favored convention used prefixes based on the direction of rotation of plane-polarized light: `lev-` (or `levo-`) for the levorotatory isomer ($-$) and `dextr-` (or `dextro-`) for the dextrorotatory isomer ($+$). For example, `levofloxacin` is the ($-$) ($S$)-enantiomer of the racemate `ofloxacin`. This system is discouraged now because optical rotation does not have a simple, universal correlation with absolute configuration or pharmacological activity.\n    *   **Distinct Names**: In some cases, a single enantiomer is given a completely new INN stem, though this can obscure the relationship to the parent racemate. However, the use of systematic prefixes like `es-` and `ar-` is the preferred modern strategy, as it creates a clear family of names (e.g., `omeprazole` the racemate, and `esomeprazole` the $S$-enantiomer), which enhances clarity and reduces the risk of medication errors.\n\nIn summary, the INN system employs prefixes such as `rac-`, `es-`, and `ar-` to systematically and unambiguously classify drug substances based on their stereochemical composition, reflecting the critical need to distinguish between racemates and pure enantiomers in medicine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.7000 & 0.3000 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4943984"}, {"introduction": "The Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) is a vital scientific framework that predicts a drug's intestinal absorption based on its solubility and permeability.

A drug substance is considered highly permeable when the extent of intestinal absorption is determined to be $\\geq 90\\%$ of an administered dose. In vitro, this is often assessed by comparing the drug's effective permeability ($P_{\\text{eff}}$) to that of a well-characterized high-permeability reference compound.
