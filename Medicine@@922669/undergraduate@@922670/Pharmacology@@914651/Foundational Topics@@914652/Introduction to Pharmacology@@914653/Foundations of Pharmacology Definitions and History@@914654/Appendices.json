First, differentiate the first relation with respect to time, assuming $V_d$ is constant:\n$\\frac{dA}{dt} = V_d \\frac{dC}{dt}$\n\nEquating this with the second foundational relation gives a differential equation for the concentration $C(t)$:\n$V_d \\frac{dC}{dt} = -CL \\, C(t)$\n$\\frac{dC}{dt} = -\\frac{CL}{V_d} C(t)$\n\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation.

Thus, we set $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} C_0$:\n$\\frac{1}{2} C_0 = C_0 \\exp(-k_e t_{1/2})$\n$\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k_e t_{1/2})$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k_e t_{1/2}$\n$-\\ln(2) = -k_e t_{1/2}$\n\nSolving for $t_{1/2}$:\n$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_e}$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $k_e$:\n$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2) V_d}{CL}$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values, $V_d = 45$ L and $CL = 3$ L/h:\n$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2) \\cdot 45 \\, \\text{L}}{3 \\, \\text{L/h}} = 15 \\ln(2) \\, \\text{h}$\n$t_{1/2} \\approx 15 \\cdot 0.693147... \\approx 10.3972... \\, \\text{h}$\n\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$t_{1/2} \\approx 10.4$ h.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the maximum dosing interval ($\\tau_{\\max}$)**\n\nFor a repeated IV bolus dosing regimen at steady state, the concentration profile fluctuates between a trough value ($C_{ss, \\text{trough}}$) and a peak value ($C_{ss, \\text{peak}}$). An IV bolus dose $D$ results in an instantaneous increase in concentration of $\\Delta C = \\frac{D}{V_d}$.\n\nAs requested, we derive the steady-state concentration using the properties of a geometric series.

We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem describes a classic agonist-receptor interaction at equilibrium, which can be modeled using the principles of mass action kinetics. The reversible binding of an agonist, denoted by $A$, to its receptor, $R$, to form an agonist-receptor complex, $AR$, is represented by the equilibrium reaction:\n$$ A + R \\rightleftharpoons AR $$\nThe law of mass action defines the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$, as the ratio of the product of the concentrations of the reactants to the concentration of the product at equilibrium:\n$$ K_D = \\frac{[A][R]}{[AR]} $$\nHere, $[A]$, $[R]$, and $[AR]$ represent the equilibrium concentrations of the free agonist, free receptor, and agonist-receptor complex, respectively.\n\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R]_{\\text{total}}$, is conserved. It is the sum of the free receptors and the agonist-bound receptors:\n$$ [R]_{\\text{total}} = [R] + [AR] $$\nWe can express the concentration of free receptors as $[R] = [R]_{\\text{total}} - [AR]$. Substituting this into the equation for $K_D$:\n$$ K_D = \\frac{[A]([R]_{\\text{total}} - [AR])}{[AR]} $$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the concentration of the agonist-receptor complex, $[AR]$:\n$$ K_D [AR] = [A][R]_{\\text{total}} - [A][AR] $$\n$$ [AR](K_D + [A]) = [A][R]_{\\text{total}} $$\n$$ [AR] = \\frac{[A][R]_{\\text{total}}}{K_D + [A]} $$\nThe fractional receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of the total receptors that are bound by the agonist, $\\theta = \\frac{[AR]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}}$. Using the expression for $[AR]$, we find:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[A]}{K_D + [A]} $$\nThis is the Hill-Langmuir equation.\n\nThe problem states that there is a linear transduction from fractional receptor occupancy to the observed effect, $E$. This implies that the effect is directly proportional to the fractional occupancy: $E([A]) = c \\cdot \\theta$, where $c$ is a proportionality constant. The maximum achievable effect, $E_{\\max}$, occurs at saturating agonist concentrations, where $\\theta$ approaches its maximum value of $1$. Thus, the constant $c$ must be equal to $E_{\\max}$, yielding the relationship:\n$$ E([A]) = E_{\\max} \\cdot \\theta = E_{\\max} \\frac{[A]}{K_D + [A]} $$\nA crucial assumption given is that there is no receptor reserve. In such a system, the concentration of agonist that produces half of the maximum effect, known as the half-maximal effective concentration ($EC_{50}$), is identical to the equilibrium dissociation constant $K_D$.
