The unknown quantity is the patient's total body clearance, $CL_{\\text{tot,pat}}$.\n\nWe must first determine the patient's total clearance based on their renal function. Total clearance is the sum of renal clearance ($CL_R$) and nonrenal clearance ($CL_{NR}$):\n$$\nCL_{\\text{tot}} = CL_R + CL_{NR}\n$$\nWe begin by decomposing the total clearance in the reference population.\nGiven: $CL_{\\text{tot,ref}} = 6.0$ $\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}$ and $f_{eu,\\text{ref}} = 0.60$.\n\nThe renal clearance in the reference population ($CL_{R,\\text{ref}}$) is the product of the total clearance and the fraction excreted unchanged:\n$$\nCL_{R,\\text{ref}} = f_{eu,\\text{ref}} \\cdot CL_{\\text{tot,ref}}\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nCL_{R,\\text{ref}} = 0.60 \\cdot 6.0 \\ \\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} = 3.6 \\ \\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}\n$$\nThe nonrenal clearance in the reference population ($CL_{NR,\\text{ref}}$) is the remaining portion of the total clearance:\n$$\nCL_{NR,\\text{ref}} = CL_{\\text{tot,ref}} - CL_{R,\\text{ref}} = (1 - f_{eu,\\text{ref}}) \\cdot CL_{\\text{tot,ref}}\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nCL_{NR,\\text{ref}} = (1 - 0.60) \\cdot 6.0 \\ \\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} = 0.40 \\cdot 6.0 \\ \\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} = 2.4 \\ \\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the clearance components for the patient.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\nThe approach to steady state for a drug with first-order elimination is governed by its elimination rate constant, $k_e$. The concentration at any time $t$ can be expressed as a fraction of the steady-state concentration, $C_{ss}$. This fraction, $f_{acc}(t)$, is given by:\n$$f_{acc}(t) = 1 - \\exp(-k_e t)$$\nThe elimination rate constant $k_e$ is related to the half-life $t_{1/2}$ by:\n$$k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$$\nGiven $t_{1/2} = 36$ hours, the rate constant is:\n$$k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{36} \\text{ h}^{-1}$$\n\nWe can now calculate the fraction of steady state that has been achieved at the times of the Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) measurements.\n\n**At $t = 72$ hours:**\nThe time elapsed is $t = 72$ hours. This corresponds to $72/36 = 2$ half-lives.\nThe fraction of steady state reached is:\n$$f_{acc}(72) = 1 - \\exp(-k_e \\times 72) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{36}\\right) \\times 72\\right) = 1 - \\exp(-2 \\ln(2)) = 1 - \\exp(\\ln(2^{-2})) = 1 - 2^{-2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = 0.75$$\nSo, at $t=72$ hours, the patient's drug concentration (both average and minimum) is at $75\\%$ of its eventual steady-state value.\nThe measured minimum concentration at this time is $C_{min}(72) = 12.0$ mg/L.\nWe can estimate the steady-state minimum concentration, $C_{min,ss}$:\n$$C_{min,ss} \\approx \\frac{C_{min}(72)}{f_{acc}(72)} = \\frac{12.0 \\text{ mg/L}}{0.75} = 16.0 \\text{ mg/L}$$\n\n**At $t = 84$ hours:**\nThe time elapsed is $t = 84$ hours. This corresponds to $84/36 = 7/3 \\approx 2.33$ half-lives.\nThe fraction of steady state reached is:\n$$f_{acc}(84) = 1 - \\exp(-k_e \\times 84) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{36}\\right) \\times 84\\right) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{7}{3}\\ln(2)\\right) = 1 - 2^{-7/3}$$\nNumerically, $2^{7/3} \\approx 5.0397$, so:\n$$f_{acc}(84) \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{5.0397} \\approx 1 - 0.1984 \\approx 0.8016$$\nSo, at $t=84$ hours, the patient is at approximately $80\\%$ of steady state.\nThe measured minimum concentration at this time is $C_{min}(84) = 12.9$ mg/L.\nUsing this point to estimate the steady-state minimum concentration:\n$$C_{min,ss} \\approx \\frac{C_{min}(84)}{f_{acc}(84)} = \\frac{12.9 \\text{ mg/L}}{0.8016} \\approx 16.09 \\text{ mg/L}$$\nThe two estimates for $C_{min,ss}$ ($16.0$ mg/L and $16.09$ mg/L) are highly consistent, validating our model and calculations.\n\n**Conclusion about Pharmacokinetic State and Further Accumulation:**\nThe patient is not at true steady state. At $t=72$ to $84$ hours, the minimum concentrations are at $75\\%$ to $80\\%$ of their final steady-state value. The apparent stability observed by the clinician (a change from $12.0$ to $12.9$ mg/L) is characteristic of the slow approach to steady state for a drug with a long half-life, a phase that can be termed a \"pseudo-steady state.\"\n\nThe predicted final minimum concentration is $C_{min,ss} \\approx 16$ mg/L. This value is within the therapeutic window of $10$ to $20$ mg/L.\nThe expected further increase in concentration can be calculated relative to the current measured levels.\n-   Relative to the $t=72$ h measurement ($12.0$ mg/L): The concentration is expected to increase by $16.0 - 12.0 = 4.0$ mg/L. The percent increase is $\\frac{4.0}{12.0} \\times 100\\% = 33.3\\%$.\n-   Relative to the $t=84$ h measurement ($12.9$ mg/L): The concentration is expected to increase by $16.0 - 12.9 = 3.1$ mg/L. The percent increase is $\\frac{3.1}{12.9} \\times 100\\% \\approx 24\\%$.\n\nTherefore, a further increase in minimum concentration on the order of $24\\%$ to $33\\%$ is expected before true steady state is approached.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. True steady state has been reached; because the minimums are within the therapeutic window and differ by less than $10\\%$, any further accumulation will be negligible (less than $5\\%$).**\nThis statement is incorrect. The calculation shows that at $t=72$ hours ($2$ half-lives), only $75\\%$ of steady state has been achieved. The assertion that the small difference between minimum concentrations signifies steady state is a common fallacy when the half-life is long. The prediction of \"negligible (less than $5\\%$)\" future accumulation is incorrect; our calculation shows an expected increase of $24\\%-33\\%$.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. This is a pseudo-steady state within the therapeutic window; only about $75$–$80\\%$ of the eventual steady-state minimum has been reached by $t = 72$–$84$ hours, so a further increase on the order of $20$–$33\\%$ is still expected before true steady state is approached.**\nThis statement accurately describes the situation. \"Pseudo-steady state\" is an appropriate term for the observed slow accumulation. Our calculations confirm that the fraction of steady state reached is $75\\%$ at $t=72$ h and $\\approx 80\\%$ at $t=84$ h. Our calculations also confirm that the expected further increase is in the range of $24\\%-33\\%$, which is captured by the stated order of $20\\%-33\\%$. The current minimums ($12.0$ and $12.9$ mg/L) are indeed within the therapeutic window.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. No accumulation occurs when the dosing interval is shorter than the half-life; therefore, stability by day $3$ guarantees true steady state.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. Accumulation is a direct consequence of dosing before the previous dose is fully eliminated. It is most significant when the dosing interval $\\tau$ is short compared to the half-life $t_{1/2}$. Here, $\\tau=12$ h is much shorter than $t_{1/2}=36$ h, which guarantees significant accumulation will occur. The premise is the opposite of the truth. Consequently, the conclusion is also false.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Steady state in first-order kinetics is binary and cannot be approximated; therefore, the term “pseudo-steady state” is invalid and the observed similarity must indicate true steady state.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Mathematically, steady state is an asymptotic limit ($t \\to \\infty$) that is never perfectly reached in finite time. In practice, it is always an approximation (e.g., considered \"reached\" after $4-5$ half-lives, when concentrations are $>93\\%$ of the asymptotic value). The concept is not binary. The term \"pseudo-steady state\" is a valid and useful descriptor for a clinical situation where slow accumulation can be mistaken for true steady state. The conclusion that similarity implies true steady state is the error being tested.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4991082"}]}
