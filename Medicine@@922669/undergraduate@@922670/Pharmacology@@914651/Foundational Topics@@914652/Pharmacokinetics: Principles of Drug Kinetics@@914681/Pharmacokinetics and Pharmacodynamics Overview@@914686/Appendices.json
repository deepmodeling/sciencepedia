Calculation of Renal Clearance ($CL_R$)**\n\nBy definition, renal clearance is the volume of plasma cleared of the drug by the kidneys per unit time. It is calculated as the rate of urinary excretion of the drug ($R_e$) divided by the plasma concentration of the drug ($C_{ss}$).\n\nFirst, we calculate the rate of excretion ($R_e$) from the urine data. The rate of excretion is the product of the urine drug concentration ($C_u$) and the urine flow rate ($Q_u$).\n$$R_e = C_u \\times Q_u$$\nThe renal clearance is then given by:\n$$CL_R = \\frac{R_e}{C_{ss}} = \\frac{C_u \\times Q_u}{C_{ss}}$$\nWe are given $C_u = 200$ mg/L, $Q_u = 1.5$ mL/min, and $C_{ss} = 5.0$ mg/L. Substituting these values into the equation for $CL_R$:\n$$CL_R = \\frac{(200 \\text{ mg/L}) \\times (1.5 \\text{ mL/min})}{5.0 \\text{ mg/L}}$$\nThe concentration units (mg/L) in the numerator and denominator cancel, leaving the units of mL/min, which is appropriate for clearance.\n$$CL_R = \\frac{300}{5.0} \\text{ mL/min} = 60 \\text{ mL/min}$$\nThe problem requests the answer rounded to three significant figures, so $CL_R = 60.0$ mL/min.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Fraction of Elimination as Unchanged Drug in Urine ($f_e$)**\n\nThe fraction of drug eliminated unchanged in urine, $f_e$, is defined as the ratio of the renal clearance ($CL_R$) to the total body clearance ($CL_T$).\n$$f_e = \\frac{CL_R}{CL_T}$$\nTo determine $f_e$, we must first calculate the total body clearance, $CL_T$. At steady state, the fundamental principle of mass balance states that the rate of drug administration equals the rate of drug elimination. The drug is administered at a constant infusion rate, $R_0$. The total rate of elimination from the body is the product of the total body clearance ($CL_T$) and the steady-state plasma concentration ($C_{ss}$).\n$$R_0 = \\text{Rate of Elimination} = CL_T \\times C_{ss}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $CL_T$:\n$$CL_T = \\frac{R_0}{C_{ss}}$$\nWe are given $R_0 = 30$ mg/h and $C_{ss} = 5.0$ mg/L.\n$$CL_T = \\frac{30 \\text{ mg/h}}{5.0 \\text{ mg/L}} = 6.0 \\text{ L/h}$$\nTo maintain consistency with the units of $CL_R$ (mL/min), we must convert the units of $CL_T$.\n$$1 \\text{ L} = 1000 \\text{ mL}$$\n$$1 \\text{ h} = 60 \\text{ min}$$\nSo, the conversion factor is $\\frac{1000 \\text{ mL/L}}{60 \\text{ min/h}}$.\n$$CL_T = 6.0 \\frac{\\text{L}}{\\text{h}} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ mL}}{1 \\text{ L}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ h}}{60 \\text{ min}} = \\frac{6000}{60} \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} = 100 \\text{ mL/min}$$\nNow we can calculate $f_e$ using the values of $CL_R$ and $CL_T$:\n$$f_e = \\frac{CL_R}{CL_T} = \\frac{60 \\text{ mL/min}}{100 \\text{ mL/min}} = 0.6$$\nThe result is a unitless fraction, as required. The problem requests this value be rounded to three significant figures, so $f_e = 0.600$.\n\nThe other provided information (patient weight, protein binding, GFR) is not required for answering the questions as posed but serves to confirm the physiological plausibility of the scenario.

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, is well-posed with all necessary parameters and conditions provided, and is objectively formulated. The model described is a standard one-compartment pharmacokinetic model linked to a single effect-site compartment, which is a common and solvable problem in the field.\n\nThe problem asks for the time lag between the peak plasma concentration and the peak pharmacodynamic effect. This requires the derivation of the time course of both the plasma concentration, $C_p(t)$, and the effect-site concentration, $C_e(t)$.\n\nFirst, we establish the time course of the plasma concentration, $C_p(t)$. The drug is administered as a single intravenous bolus dose, $D$, into a system described by a one-compartment model with first-order elimination. The governing differential equation for the plasma concentration is:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_p}{dt} = -k_{\\text{el}} C_p(t)\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\text{el}}$ is the first-order elimination rate constant. The initial condition at time $t=0$ is $C_p(0) = C_0$, where $C_0$ is the initial concentration resulting from the bolus dose $D$ distributed in the apparent volume of distribution $V$. Thus, $C_0 = D/V$.\nThe solution to this first-order linear ordinary differential equation is an exponential decay function:\n$$\nC_p(t) = C_0 \\exp(-k_{\\text{el}} t)\n$$\nThe peak plasma concentration, by the nature of an intravenous bolus injection, occurs at the moment of injection, $t = 0$. Therefore, the time of peak plasma concentration is $t_{\\text{peak, plasma}} = 0$.\n\nNext, we derive the time course of the effect-site concentration, $C_e(t)$. The effect-site compartment is linked to the plasma via a first-order process, with an equilibration rate constant $k_{e0}$. The rate of change of the effect-site concentration is described by the mass balance equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_e}{dt} = k_{e0} C_p(t) - k_{e0} C_e(t)\n$$\nThis equation states that the change in $C_e$ is the rate of drug entry from the plasma ($k_{e0} C_p(t)$) minus the rate of drug exit from the effect site ($k_{e0} C_e(t)$).
