The provided pharmacokinetic parameters are within a realistic range for a therapeutic drug. The problem will be solved by applying first principles of mass balance and core pharmacokinetic definitions.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Oral Loading Dose ($LD$)**\n\nThe loading dose ($LD$) is intended to rapidly achieve a target amount of drug in the body, which corresponds to the target plasma concentration ($C_{\\text{target}}$). The fundamental relationship between the amount of drug in the body ($A$) and the plasma concentration ($C$) is given by the definition of the volume of distribution ($V_{d}$):\n$$C = \\frac{A}{V_d}$$\nTherefore, to achieve a target concentration of $C_{\\text{target}}$, the required amount of drug in the body ($A_{\\text{target}}$) is:\n$$A_{\\text{target}} = C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot V_{d}$$\nThe problem specifies oral administration. The bioavailability, $F$, is the fraction of the administered oral dose that reaches the systemic circulation. Thus, the amount of drug that actually enters the body from an oral loading dose ($LD$) is $F \\cdot LD$.\nFor the amount of drug in the body to instantaneously reach $A_{\\text{target}}$ upon absorption, we must have:\n$$F \\cdot LD = A_{\\text{target}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $A_{\\text{target}}$, we get the mass-balance equation for the loading dose:\n$$F \\cdot LD = C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot V_{d}$$\nSolving for $LD$:\n$$LD = \\frac{C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot V_{d}}{F}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n-   $C_{\\text{target}} = 7.5 \\text{ mg/L}$\n-   $V_{d} = 35 \\text{ L}$\n-   $F = 0.85$\n$$LD = \\frac{(7.5 \\text{ mg/L}) \\cdot (35 \\text{ L})}{0.85} = \\frac{262.5 \\text{ mg}}{0.85} \\approx 308.8235 \\text{ mg}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the loading dose is $308.8$ mg.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Oral Maintenance Dose ($MD$)**\n\nThe maintenance dose ($MD$) is designed to replace the amount of drug eliminated by the body over one dosing interval ($\\tau$), thereby maintaining the average concentration at a steady state. At steady state, the average rate of drug administration must equal the average rate of drug elimination.\n\nThe rate of drug elimination is governed by clearance ($CL$). Clearance is defined as the volume of plasma cleared of the drug per unit time. The rate of elimination (mass per time) is the product of clearance and plasma concentration ($C$):\n$$\\text{Rate of Elimination} = CL \\cdot C$$\nAt steady state, the concentration fluctuates, but the average rate of elimination over a dosing interval can be calculated using the average steady-state concentration, $C_{ss,avg}$. The problem requires this average to be the target concentration, $C_{\\text{target}}$.\n$$\\text{Average Rate of Elimination} = CL \\cdot C_{ss,avg} = CL \\cdot C_{\\text{target}}$$\nThe rate of drug administration is the amount of drug entering the systemic circulation per dosing interval, averaged over that interval. For an oral maintenance dose $MD$ with bioavailability $F$ given every $\\tau$ hours, the amount entering the circulation per dose is $F \\cdot MD$. The average rate of administration is:\n$$\\text{Average Rate of Administration} = \\frac{F \\cdot MD}{\\tau}$$\nEquating the average rates at steady state:\n$$\\frac{F \\cdot MD}{\\tau} = CL \\cdot C_{\\text{target}}$$\nSolving for $MD$:\n$$MD = \\frac{CL \\cdot C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot \\tau}{F}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n-   $CL = 2.8 \\text{ L/h}$\n-   $C_{\\text{target}} = 7.5 \\text{ mg/L}$\n-   $\\tau = 12 \\text{ h}$\n-   $F = 0.85$\n$$MD = \\frac{(2.8 \\text{ L/h}) \\cdot (7.5 \\text{ mg/L}) \\cdot (12 \\text{ h})}{0.85} = \\frac{252 \\text{ mg}}{0.85} \\approx 296.4705 \\text{ mg}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the maintenance dose is $296.5$ mg.\n\n**3. Impact of Errors in $V_{d}$ and $CL$**\n\nThe roles of volume of distribution ($V_{d}$) and clearance ($CL$) are distinct, and errors in their estimation have different consequences for the loading dose and maintenance dosing outcomes.\n\n**Effect on Initial Concentration after Loading Dose:**\nThe initial concentration achieved immediately after the absorption of the loading dose, $C_{0}$, is determined by the principle that the bioavailable dose ($F \\cdot LD$) fills the volume of distribution ($V_d$).\n$$C_{0} = \\frac{F \\cdot LD}{V_d}$$\nThe loading dose ($LD$) is calculated using an *estimated* $V_{d,est}$: $LD = \\frac{C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot V_{d,est}}{F}$. Substituting this into the equation for the *actual* achieved concentration $C_0$ which depends on the *true* $V_d$:\n$$C_0 = \\frac{F}{V_d} \\left( \\frac{C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot V_{d,est}}{F} \\right) = C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot \\frac{V_{d,est}}{V_d}$$\nThis relationship shows that the achieved initial concentration $C_0$ is directly proportional to the estimated $V_{d,est}$ and inversely proportional to the true $V_d$.\n-   If $V_d$ is **overestimated** ($V_{d,est} > V_d$), the calculated $LD$ will be too large. This results in an achieved initial concentration $C_0$ that is **higher** than the target $C_{\\text{target}}$.\n-   If $V_d$ is **underestimated** ($V_{d,est} < V_d$), the calculated $LD$ will be too small, resulting in an achieved $C_0$ that is **lower** than $C_{\\text{target}}$.\nCritically, the parameter $CL$ does not appear in the equation for $C_0$. Therefore, an error in the estimation of $CL$ has **no effect** on the initial concentration achieved by the loading dose. $CL$ only governs how quickly the concentration declines *after* this initial level is achieved.\n\n**Effect on Average Steady-State Concentration:**\nThe average steady-state concentration ($C_{ss,avg}$) is determined by the balance between the rate of drug administration and the rate of drug elimination. As derived previously:\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{F \\cdot MD}{CL \\cdot \\tau}$$\nThe maintenance dose ($MD$) is calculated using an *estimated* $CL_{est}$: $MD = \\frac{CL_{est} \\cdot C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot \\tau}{F}$. Substituting this into the equation for the *actual* achieved $C_{ss,avg}$ which depends on the *true* $CL$:\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{F}{CL \\cdot \\tau} \\left( \\frac{CL_{est} \\cdot C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot \\tau}{F} \\right) = C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot \\frac{CL_{est}}{CL}$$\nThis relationship shows that the achieved $C_{ss,avg}$ is directly proportional to the estimated $CL_{est}$ and inversely proportional to the true $CL$.\n-   If $CL$ is **overestimated** ($CL_{est} > CL$), the calculated $MD$ will be too large to compensate for a faster-than-actual perceived elimination. This results in an achieved $C_{ss,avg}$ that is **higher** than the target $C_{\\text{target}}$.\n-   If $CL$ is **underestimated** ($CL_{est} < CL$), the calculated $MD$ will be too small, resulting in an achieved $C_{ss,avg}$ that is **lower** than $C_{\\text{target}}$.\nCritically, the parameter $V_d$ does not appear in the equation for $C_{ss,avg}$. Therefore, an error in the estimation of $V_d$ has **no effect** on the average concentration achieved at steady state. An incorrect $V_d$ would alter the time to reach steady state and the magnitude of the fluctuations (peak and trough concentrations) around the average, but not the average value itself.\n\nIn summary, the loading dose and the initial concentration are governed by $V_d$, while the maintenance dose and the average steady-state concentration are governed by $CL$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 308.8 & 296.5 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4961351"}, {"introduction": "Effective drug therapy requires more than just maintaining an average concentration; it demands keeping drug levels within a specific therapeutic window to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity.

It describes a classic and fundamental scenario in clinical pharmacology: the calculation of a maintenance dosing regimen using a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model. This model, characterized by first-order elimination and intermittent dosing, is a cornerstone of the field.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. All necessary parameters ($k$, $\\tau$, $V_d$, $F$) and conditions (steady-state, therapeutic window) are explicitly provided to determine a unique maintenance dose and the resulting concentration profile. The assumption of \"instantaneous input\" is a standard simplification, equivalent to setting the absorption rate constant $k_a \\to \\infty$, which makes the problem solvable without needing $k_a$. This simplification transforms the oral dosing model into an equivalent intravenous (IV) bolus model for the purposes of calculating peak and trough concentrations, which is a common pedagogical approach.\n\nThe problem is objective and free of ambiguity. It uses standard terminology and provides clear, quantitative goals. The setup is internally consistent; there are no contradictory constraints. The values provided for the pharmacokinetic parameters are realistic for a real-world drug.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem assumes a single-compartment model with first-order elimination at steady state, and critically, \"instantaneous input at the dosing times\". This simplification implies that the absorption phase is negligible, and the bioavailable fraction of the oral dose, $F \\cdot D_M$, enters the systemic circulation immediately at the beginning of each dosing interval, $t=0$. This is mathematically equivalent to an intravenous (IV) bolus administration of a dose equal to $F \\cdot D_M$.\n\nUnder these conditions, the drug concentration in the plasma peaks immediately after administration and then declines exponentially with a rate constant $k$. At steady state, the concentration just after a dose (the peak) is given by:\n$$C_{\\text{ss,max}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{effective}}}{V_d} \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-k \\tau)}$$\nwhere $D_{\\text{effective}}$ is the effective dose reaching the systemic circulation. For an oral dose $D_M$ with bioavailability $F$, this effective dose is $F \\cdot D_M$. Substituting this gives:\n$$C_{\\text{ss,max}} = \\frac{F D_M}{V_d} \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-k \\tau)}$$\nThe concentration just before the next dose (the trough) is the peak concentration after it has decayed over one full dosing interval, $\\tau$:\n$$C_{\\text{ss,min}} = C_{\\text{ss,max}} \\exp(-k \\tau)$$\n\nThe first objective is to find the maintenance dose, $D_M$, that places the steady-state peak concentration exactly at the upper boundary of the therapeutic window.\nLet $C_{\\text{ss,max}}^{\\text{target}} = 10\\ \\text{mg}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$. We rearrange the equation for $C_{\\text{ss,max}}$ to solve for $D_M$:\n$$D_M = \\frac{C_{\\text{ss,max}}^{\\text{target}} V_d (1 - \\exp(-k \\tau))}{F}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n- $C_{\\text{ss,max}}^{\\text{target}} = 10\\ \\text{mg}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$\n- $V_d = 40\\ \\text{L}$\n- $k = 0.1\\ \\text{h}^{-1}$\n- $\\tau = 8\\ \\text{h}$\n- $F = 0.80$\n\nFirst, we calculate the product $k \\tau$:\n$$k \\tau = (0.1\\ \\text{h}^{-1}) \\times (8\\ \\text{h}) = 0.8$$\nNow, substitute the values into the equation for $D_M$:\n$$D_M = \\frac{(10\\ \\text{mg}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}) \\times (40\\ \\text{L}) \\times (1 - \\exp(-0.8))}{0.80}$$\n$$D_M = \\frac{400}{0.80} (1 - \\exp(-0.8))\\ \\text{mg}$$\n$$D_M = 500 (1 - \\exp(-0.8))\\ \\text{mg}$$\nUsing a calculator, $1 - \\exp(-0.8) \\approx 1 - 0.44932896 = 0.55067104$.\n$$D_M \\approx 500 \\times 0.55067104\\ \\text{mg} \\approx 275.3355\\ \\text{mg}$$\nThe problem requires rounding the maintenance dose to three significant figures.\n$$D_{M, \\text{rounded}} = 275\\ \\text{mg}$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to use this rounded dose to predict the actual steady-state peak and trough concentrations and verify they are within the therapeutic window of $3$–$10$ $\\text{mg}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$.\n\nUsing $D_{M, \\text{rounded}} = 275\\ \\text{mg}$, we recalculate the peak concentration:\n$$C_{\\text{ss,max}} = \\frac{F D_{M, \\text{rounded}}}{V_d} \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-k \\tau)}$$\n$$C_{\\text{ss,max}} = \\frac{0.80 \\cdot 275\\ \\text{mg}}{40\\ \\text{L}} \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-0.8)}$$\n$$C_{\\text{ss,max}} = \\frac{220\\ \\text{mg}}{40\\ \\text{L}} \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-0.8)} = 5.5 \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-0.8)}\\ \\text{mg}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$$\n$$C_{\\text{ss,max}} \\approx 5.5 \\times \\frac{1}{0.55067104} \\approx 9.9878\\ \\text{mg}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the corresponding trough concentration:\n$$C_{\\text{ss,min}} = C_{\\text{ss,max}} \\exp(-k \\tau)$$\n$$C_{\\text{ss,min}} \\approx (9.9878\\ \\text{mg}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}) \\times \\exp(-0.8)$$\n$$C_{\\text{ss,min}} \\approx (9.9878\\ \\text{mg}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}) \\times 0.44932896 \\approx 4.4878\\ \\text{mg}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$$\n\nFinally, we verify these concentrations against the therapeutic window ($3$–$10$ $\\text{mg}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$):\n- The predicted peak concentration is $C_{\\text{ss,max}} \\approx 9.99\\ \\text{mg}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe analysis is based on the principles of a linear one-compartment model with first-order elimination and repeated bolus dosing.\n\nFirst, we determine the first-order elimination rate constant, $k_e$, from the elimination half-life, $t_{1/2}$:\n$$k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$$\nGiven $t_{1/2} = 6\\,\\mathrm{h}$,\n$$k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{6}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$$\nThe fraction of drug remaining after one dosing interval, $\\tau = 8\\,\\mathrm{h}$, is given by the term $e^{-k_e \\tau}$.\n$$e^{-k_e \\tau} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{6} \\cdot 8\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4}{3}\\ln(2)\\right) = \\left(e^{\\ln(2)}\\right)^{-4/3} = 2^{-4/3}$$\nThis term is a constant that will be used throughout the calculations. $2^{-4/3} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{16}} \\approx 0.39685$.\n\nAt steady state ($ss$), the maximum and minimum concentrations ($C_{ss,max}$ and $C_{ss,min}$) are constant from cycle to cycle. The concentration immediately after a dose is $C_{ss,max}$, and the concentration just before the next dose is $C_{ss,min}$. They are related by:\n$$C_{ss,min} = C_{ss,max} \\cdot e^{-k_e \\tau}$$\nThe immediate increase in concentration after an oral dose $D_0$ is $\\Delta C = \\frac{F D_0}{V_d}$. At steady state, the concentration jumps from $C_{ss,min}$ to $C_{ss,max}$:\n$$C_{ss,max} = C_{ss,min} + \\frac{F D_0}{V_d}$$\nSolving these two simultaneous equations for $C_{ss,max}$ and $C_{ss,min}$ gives:\n$$C_{ss,max} = \\frac{F D_0}{V_d} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-k_e \\tau}}$$\n$$C_{ss,min} = \\frac{F D_0}{V_d} \\cdot \\frac{e^{-k_e \\tau}}{1 - e^{-k_e \\tau}}$$\n\nThe problem states that the patient, at steady state, misses one dose. Let's denote the time of the *last properly administered dose* as $t=0$. At $t=0^+$, the concentration is $C_{ss,max}$. The missed dose was scheduled for time $t=\\tau$. The next dose is scheduled for time $t=2\\tau$. We must find the trough concentration at $t=2\\tau$.\n\nAt time $t=\\tau$, just before the scheduled (but missed) dose, the concentration has decayed from $C_{ss,max}$ to $C_{ss,min}$:\n$$C(\\tau^-) = C_{ss,max} \\cdot e^{-k_e \\tau} = C_{ss,min}$$\nSince the dose at $t=\\tau$ is missed, the concentration does not increase. It continues to decay from $C_{ss,min}$ for another full dosing interval of $\\tau$.\nThe altered trough concentration at time $t=2\\tau$, which we denote as $C'_{trough}$, is:\n$$C'_{trough} = C(\\tau^-) \\cdot e^{-k_e \\tau} = C_{ss,min} \\cdot e^{-k_e \\tau}$$\n\n**Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Altered Concentrations**\n\nThe new trough concentration is $C'_{trough} = C_{ss,min} \\cdot e^{-k_e \\tau}$. Since $k_e > 0$ and $\\tau > 0$, the factor $e^{-k_e \\tau}$ is less than $1$. Therefore, **qualitatively**, the new trough concentration is lower than the usual steady-state trough concentration.\n\nNumerically:\nThe incremental concentration is $\\Delta C = \\frac{F D_0}{V_d} = \\frac{0.80 \\cdot 300\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{40\\,\\mathrm{L}} = 6\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\nThe steady-state trough is:\n$$C_{ss,min} = \\Delta C \\cdot \\frac{e^{-k_e \\tau}}{1 - e^{-k_e \\tau}} = 6\\,\\mathrm{mg/L} \\cdot \\frac{2^{-4/3}}{1 - 2^{-4/3}} \\approx 6 \\cdot \\frac{0.39685}{1 - 0.39685} \\approx 3.948\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$$\nThe altered trough is:\n$$C'_{trough} = C_{ss,min} \\cdot e^{-k_e \\tau} \\approx 3.948\\,\\mathrm{mg/L} \\cdot 0.39685 \\approx 1.567\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$$\nThe new trough is approximately $1.57\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$, significantly lower than the steady-state trough of approximately $3.95\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\n\nIf a usual dose $D_0$ were administered at $t=2\\tau$, the new peak would be $C'_{peak} = C'_{trough} + \\Delta C$. The usual peak is $C_{ss,max} = C_{ss,min} + \\Delta C$.\n**Qualitatively**, since $C'_{trough} < C_{ss,min}$, the new peak $C'_{peak}$ would be lower than the usual steady-state peak $C_{ss,max}$.\nNumerically:\n$C_{ss,max} = C_{ss,min} + \\Delta C \\approx 3.948 + 6 = 9.948\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\n$C'_{peak} = C'_{trough} + \\Delta C \\approx 1.567 + 6 = 7.567\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\nThe new peak would be approximately $7.57\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$ instead of the usual $9.95\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\n\n**Determination of the Compensatory Dose**\n\nThe goal is to administer a new oral dose, $D'$, at time $t=2\\tau$ to instantaneously restore the concentration to the usual steady-state peak, $C_{ss,max}$. The concentration just before this dose is $C'_{trough}$. The new dose $D'$ must cause a concentration increase of $\\frac{F D'}{V_d}$ such that:\n$$C'_{trough} + \\frac{F D'}{V_d} = C_{ss,max}$$\nWe can substitute the known relationships for the concentration terms:\n$$C_{ss,min} \\cdot e^{-k_e \\tau} + \\frac{F D'}{V_d} = C_{ss,min} + \\frac{F D_0}{V_d}$$\nRearranging to solve for $D'$:\n$$\\frac{F D'}{V_d} = C_{ss,min} - C_{ss,min} \\cdot e^{-k_e \\tau} + \\frac{F D_0}{V_d}$$\n$$\\frac{F D'}{V_d} = C_{ss,min}(1 - e^{-k_e \\tau}) + \\frac{F D_0}{V_d}$$\nNow, substitute the expression for $C_{ss,min} = \\frac{F D_0}{V_d} \\frac{e^{-k_e \\tau}}{1 - e^{-k_e \\tau}}$:\n$$\\frac{F D'}{V_d} = \\left(\\frac{F D_0}{V_d} \\frac{e^{-k_e \\tau}}{1 - e^{-k_e \\tau}}\\right) (1 - e^{-k_e \\tau}) + \\frac{F D_0}{V_d}$$\nThe term $(1 - e^{-k_e \\tau})$ cancels out:\n$$\\frac{F D'}{V_d} = \\frac{F D_0}{V_d} e^{-k_e \\tau} + \\frac{F D_0}{V_d}$$\nMultiplying both sides by $\\frac{V_d}{F}$ gives the expression for the required dose $D'$:\n$$D' = D_0 e^{-k_e \\tau} + D_0 = D_0 (1 + e^{-k_e \\tau})$$\nThis result is intuitive: the required dose is the normal maintenance dose $D_0$ plus a \"make-up\" dose, $D_0 e^{-k_e \\tau}$, which corresponds to the amount of the missed dose that would have been eliminated during the interval $\\tau$.\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value of $D'$.\nGiven $D_0 = 300\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ and $e^{-k_e \\tau} = 2^{-4/3}$.\n$$D' = 300\\,\\mathrm{mg} \\cdot (1 + 2^{-4/3})$$\n$$D' = 300 \\cdot (1 + 0.39685026...)$$\n$$D' = 300 \\cdot (1.39685026...)$$\n$$D' = 419.05507...\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $419\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{419}$$", "id": "4961362"}]}
