It contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We proceed with the derivation.\n\n**Derivation of the Governing Differential Equation**\n\nThe principle of conservation of mass states that the rate of change of the amount of drug in the body, $\\frac{dA}{dt}$, is the rate of drug administration minus the rate of drug elimination.\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = \\text{Rate In} - \\text{Rate Out}\n$$\nFor a single IV bolus injection administered at $t=0$, the rate of administration is zero for all subsequent times $t>0$. The rate of elimination (\"Rate Out\") is given as being directly proportional to the amount of drug present, $A(t)$. The proportionality constant is the first-order elimination rate constant, $k$. Since the amount of drug is decreasing, the rate of change is negative. Therefore, the governing differential equation for the amount of drug $A(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -k A(t)\n$$\nThe problem requires the differential equation in terms of concentration, $C(t)$. We are given the relationship $A(t) = V_{d} C(t)$. Assuming the volume of distribution $V_{d}$ is constant, we can differentiate this relationship with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}A(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(V_{d} C(t)) \\implies \\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = V_{d} \\frac{dC(t)}{dt}\n$$\nNow, we substitute both $A(t) = V_{d} C(t)$ and $\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = V_{d} \\frac{dC(t)}{dt}$ into the differential equation for $A(t)$:\n$$\nV_{d} \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -k (V_{d} C(t))\n$$\nSince $V_{d}$ is a physical volume, it is a positive constant ($V_{d}>0$), so we can divide both sides by $V_{d}$ to obtain the differential equation governing the drug concentration $C(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -k C(t)\n$$\n\n**Integration of the Differential Equation**\n\nThis is a first-order separable ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separating the variables $C$ and $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{C(t)} dC = -k dt\n$$\nNext, we integrate both sides of the equation.\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{C(t)} dC = \\int -k dt\n$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$\n\\ln|C(t)| = -kt + I\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the constant of integration. Since concentration $C(t)$ must be a non-negative physical quantity, we can remove the absolute value signs, assuming $C(t) \\ge 0$.\n$$\n\\ln(C(t)) = -kt + I\n$$\nTo solve for $C(t)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\n\\exp(\\ln(C(t))) = \\exp(-kt + I)\n$$\n$$\nC(t) = \\exp(-kt) \\exp(I)\n$$\nWe can define a new constant, $C' = \\exp(I)$, to represent the constant factor determined by the initial conditions. The general solution is then:\n$$\nC(t) = C' \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nTo find the particular solution, we apply the given initial condition, $C(0) = C_{0}$. Substituting $t=0$ into the general solution:\n$$\nC(0) = C' \\exp(-k \\cdot 0) = C' \\exp(0) = C' \\cdot 1 = C'\n$$\nThus, the constant $C'$ is equal to the initial concentration, $C_0$. Substituting this back into the general solution gives the final concentration-time profile:\n$$\nC(t) = C_{0} \\exp(-kt)\n$$\n\n**Calculation of the Time $t_{1/5}$**\n\nThe final step is to find the time $t_{1/5}$ at which the concentration has declined to one-fifth of its initial value, i.e., $C(t_{1/5}) = C_{0}/5$. We use the derived concentration-time profile:\n$$\nC(t_{1/5}) = C_{0} \\exp(-k t_{1/5})\n$$\nSetting this equal to $C_{0}/5$:\n$$\n\\frac{C_{0}}{5} = C_{0} \\exp(-k t_{1/5})\n$$\nAssuming a non-zero initial dose was given, $C_{0} > 0$, we can divide both sides by $C_{0}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{5} = \\exp(-k t_{1/5})\n$$\nTo solve for $t_{1/5}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = \\ln(\\exp(-k t_{1/5}))\n$$\nUsing the logarithm properties $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$ and $\\ln(\\exp(y)) = y$, the equation becomes:\n$$\n-\\ln(5) = -k t_{1/5}\n$$\nFinally, we isolate $t_{1/5}$ by dividing by $-k$. Since $k>0$, this operation is well-defined.\n$$\nt_{1/5} = \\frac{-\\ln(5)}{-k} = \\frac{\\ln(5)}{k}\n$$\nThis is the required expression for $t_{1/5}$ in terms of $k$ only.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\ln(5)}{k}}\n$$", "id": "4995924"}, {"introduction": "While many drugs follow first-order elimination, some exhibit zero-order kinetics, where the body eliminates a constant amount of drug per unit of time, a common scenario when metabolic pathways are saturated.

A solution will be furnished.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe amount of drug in the body, $A(t)$, decreases linearly between doses due to zero-order elimination. The governing equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = -k_{0}\n$$\nLet us analyze the drug amount over one dosing interval, from just after the $(n-1)$-th dose at time $t=(n-1)\\tau$ to just before the $n$-th dose at time $t=n\\tau$. The amount just after the dose at time $(n-1)\\tau$ is denoted as $A_{n-1}^{+}$, the peak amount. For any time $t$ in the interval $[(n-1)\\tau, n\\tau)$, the amount $A(t)$ can be found by integrating the differential equation:\n$$\n\\int_{A_{n-1}^{+}}^{A(t)} dA' = \\int_{(n-1)\\tau}^{t} -k_{0} dt'\n$$\n$$\nA(t) - A_{n-1}^{+} = -k_{0} (t - (n-1)\\tau)\n$$\n$$\nA(t) = A_{n-1}^{+} - k_{0} (t - (n-1)\\tau)\n$$\nThe amount of drug just before the $n$-th dose, denoted $A_n^{-}$, occurs at time $t \\to (n\\tau)^{-}$. Using the above equation:\n$$\nA_n^{-} = A_{n-1}^{+} - k_{0} (n\\tau - (n-1)\\tau) = A_{n-1}^{+} - k_{0}\\tau\n$$\nAt time $t=n\\tau$, an instantaneous bolus dose $D$ is administered. The amount of drug just after this dose, $A_n^{+}$, is:\n$$\nA_n^{+} = A_n^{-} + D = (A_{n-1}^{+} - k_{0}\\tau) + D\n$$\nThis establishes a recurrence relation for the peak amount after each dose:\n$$\nA_n^{+} = A_{n-1}^{+} + D - k_{0}\\tau\n$$\nThis is an arithmetic progression. The first dose ($n=1$) is given at $t=0$. Before this dose, the amount of drug in the body is $A_0 = 0$. The peak amount after the first dose is:\n$$\nA_1^{+} = A_0 + D = D\n$$\nUsing the recurrence relation, we can find the general formula for $A_n^{+}$:\n$$\nA_2^{+} = A_1^{+} + D - k_{0}\\tau = D + (D - k_{0}\\tau)\n$$\n$$\nA_3^{+} = A_2^{+} + D - k_{0}\\tau = D + 2(D - k_{0}\\tau)\n$$\nBy induction, the peak amount after the $n$-th dose (administered at time $t=(n-1)\\tau$) is:\n$$\nA_n^{+} = D + (n-1)(D - k_{0}\\tau)\n$$\nThe peak concentration after the $n$-th dose, $C_n^{+}$, is $A_n^{+} / V_{d}$:\n$$\nC_n^{+} = \\frac{D + (n-1)(D - k_{0}\\tau)}{V_d}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we determine if the regimen leads to accumulation. Accumulation occurs if the peak concentration increases with each dose, i.e., $C_n^{+} > C_{n-1}^{+}$ for $n>1$. This is equivalent to $A_n^{+} > A_{n-1}^{+}$. From the recurrence relation, this condition holds if:\n$$\nA_n^{+} - A_{n-1}^{+} = D - k_{0}\\tau > 0 \\implies D > k_{0}\\tau\n$$\nUsing the given numerical values:\n-   $D = 600 \\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n-   $k_{0} = 50 \\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{h}$\n-   $\\tau = 6 \\,\\mathrm{h}$\nThe amount of drug eliminated per dosing interval is $k_{0}\\tau = (50 \\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{h}) \\times (6 \\,\\mathrm{h}) = 300 \\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\nSince $D = 600 \\,\\mathrm{mg}$ is greater than $k_{0}\\tau = 300 \\,\\mathrm{mg}$, the condition $D > k_{0}\\tau$ is satisfied. Therefore, drug accumulation occurs with each successive dose.\n\nFinally, we must compute the earliest time $t_{\\text{tox}}$ at which the peak concentration first reaches or exceeds $C_{\\text{tox}}$. We need to find the smallest integer $n \\ge 1$ such that $C_n^{+} \\ge C_{\\text{tox}}$.\n$$\n\\frac{D + (n-1)(D - k_{0}\\tau)}{V_d} \\ge C_{\\text{tox}}\n$$\nWe solve this inequality for $n$.\n$$\nD + (n-1)(D - k_{0}\\tau) \\ge C_{\\text{tox}} V_d\n$$\n$$\n(n-1)(D - k_{0}\\tau) \\ge C_{\\text{tox}} V_d - D\n$$\nSince $D - k_{0}\\tau > 0$, we can divide by it without reversing the inequality:\n$$\nn-1 \\ge \\frac{C_{\\text{tox}} V_d - D}{D - k_{0}\\tau}\n$$\n$$\nn \\ge 1 + \\frac{C_{\\text{tox}} V_d - D}{D - k_{0}\\tau}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n-   $V_d = 30 \\,\\mathrm{L}$\n-   $C_{\\text{tox}} = 55 \\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L}$\n-   $D = 600 \\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n-   $D - k_{0}\\tau = 600 \\,\\mathrm{mg} - 300 \\,\\mathrm{mg} = 300 \\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n$$\nC_{\\text{tox}} V_d - D = (55 \\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L}) \\times (30 \\,\\mathrm{L}) - 600 \\,\\mathrm{mg} = 1650 \\,\\mathrm{mg} - 600 \\,\\mathrm{mg} = 1050 \\,\\mathrm{mg}\n$$\nNow substitute this back into the inequality for $n$:\n$$\nn \\ge 1 + \\frac{1050}{300} = 1 + 3.5 = 4.5\n$$\nThe smallest integer $n$ that satisfies $n \\ge 4.5$ is $n=5$. Thus, the toxic concentration is first reached or exceeded at the 5th dose.\n\nThe $n$-th dose is administered at time $t = (n-1)\\tau$.

We will solve for $C(t)$ in each phase and then combine the solutions to form a single continuous function.\n\n**Phase 1: Zero-Order Elimination ($C(t) > C^*$)**\nThe process begins at $t=0$ with an initial concentration $C(0) = C_0$. Since $C_0 > C^*$, the elimination is initially governed by the zero-order rate law:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = -a\n$$\nThis is a separable first-order ODE. We integrate it with respect to time from the initial condition at $t=0$ to an arbitrary time $t$ during this phase:\n$$\n\\int_{C(0)}^{C(t)} dC' = \\int_{0}^{t} -a \\, dt'\n$$\nSubstituting $C(0) = C_0$, we get:\n$$\nC(t) - C_0 = -at\n$$\nSolving for $C(t)$ yields the expression for the concentration during the zero-order phase:\n$$\nC(t) = C_0 - at\n$$\nThis linear decay is valid as long as the concentration $C(t)$ remains above the threshold $C^*$.\n\n**Transition Time ($t^*$)**\nThe transition from zero-order to first-order kinetics occurs at the exact moment, let's call it $t^*$, when the concentration falls to the threshold value $C^*$. We can determine $t^*$ by setting $C(t^*) = C^*$ in the equation from Phase 1:\n$$\nC^* = C_0 - at^*\n$$\nSolving for $t^*$ gives:\n$$\nat^* = C_0 - C^*\n$$\n$$\nt^* = \\frac{C_0 - C^*}{a}\n$$\nGiven that $C_0 > C^*$ and $a > 0$, the transition time $t^*$ is positive and well-defined.
