It is scientifically grounded in the fundamental principles of pharmacokinetics, a sub-discipline of pharmacology and toxicology. It is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We may therefore proceed.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the concentration-time profile for a xenobiotic in a one-compartment model with first-order elimination, followed by a calculation of its half-life.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the governing expression for $C(t)$**\n\nWe begin with the principle of mass balance. For a single, well-mixed compartment, the rate of change of the amount of a substance, $A$, within the compartment is equal to the rate of input minus the rate of elimination.\n$$ \\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = \\text{Rate of Input} - \\text{Rate of Elimination} $$\nThe xenobiotic is administered as an intravenous (IV) bolus at time $t=0$. This means the entire dose is introduced instantaneously, so for any time $t > 0$, the rate of input is zero.\n$$ \\text{Rate of Input} = 0 \\quad (\\text{for } t > 0) $$\nThe problem states that elimination is a first-order process, meaning the rate of elimination is directly proportional to the amount of xenobiotic, $A(t)$, present in the body at time $t$.\n$$ \\text{Rate of Elimination} = k \\cdot A(t) $$\nHere, $k$ is the first-order elimination rate constant, which has units of inverse time (e.g., $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, or $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$).\n\nSubstituting these into the mass balance equation gives the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the amount of xenobiotic in the body:\n$$ \\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -k \\cdot A(t) $$\nThe concentration of the xenobiotic, $C(t)$, is defined as the amount $A(t)$ divided by the volume of distribution, $V$.\n$$ C(t) = \\frac{A(t)}{V} $$\nSince $V$ is a constant, we can write $A(t) = V \\cdot C(t)$. Substituting this into the ODE:\n$$ \\frac{d(V \\cdot C(t))}{dt} = -k \\cdot (V \\cdot C(t)) $$\nBecause $V$ is constant, we can pull it out of the derivative:\n$$ V \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -k V C(t) $$\nDividing both sides by $V$ (assuming $V \\neq 0$) yields the differential equation for concentration:\n$$ \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -k C(t) $$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous ODE. We can solve it by separation of variables. Let $C_0$ be the initial concentration at $t=0$.\n$$ \\frac{dC}{C} = -k \\, dt $$\nWe integrate both sides, from the initial condition $(t=0, C=C_0)$ to a later state $(t, C(t))$:\n$$ \\int_{C_0}^{C(t)} \\frac{1}{C'} dC' = \\int_0^t -k \\, dt' $$\n$$ [\\ln|C'|]_{C_0}^{C(t)} = [-kt']_0^t $$\n$$ \\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C_0) = -kt $$\nNote that concentration $C$ is a non-negative quantity.\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C_0}\\right) = -kt $$\nExponentiating both sides gives the governing expression for the time course of the concentration:\n$$ C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-kt) $$\nThe initial concentration $C_0$ is the dose, $D$, divided by the volume of distribution, $V$, so $C_0 = D/V$.\n\n**Part 2: Definitions and Relationships of Pharmacokinetic Parameters**\n\n1.  **Elimination Rate Constant ($k$)**: As introduced above, $k$ is the first-order elimination rate constant. It is the constant of proportionality that links the rate of drug elimination to the amount of drug in the body. It represents the fraction of the drug in the body that is eliminated per unit time. Its units are inverse time (e.g., $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$).\n\n2.  **Half-life ($t_{1/2}$)**: The half-life is defined as the time required for the concentration of the xenobiotic to decrease to half of its initial value. We can derive its relationship with $k$ by setting $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} C_0$.\n    $$ \\frac{1}{2} C_0 = C_0 \\exp(-k t_{1/2}) $$\n    $$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2}) $$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k t_{1/2} $$\n    $$ -\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2} $$\n    $$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k} $$\n    This shows that for a first-order process, the half-life is constant and independent of the concentration.\n\n3.  **Clearance (CL)**: Clearance is a measure of the efficiency of xenobiotic elimination from the body. It is defined as the volume of a physiological fluid (e.g., plasma) from which the substance is completely removed per unit of time. It relates the rate of elimination to the concentration $C(t)$:\n    $$ \\text{Rate of Elimination} = \\text{CL} \\cdot C(t) $$\n    The units of clearance are volume per time (e.g., $\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$).\n\nTo relate clearance (CL) to $k$ and $V$, we equate the two expressions for the rate of elimination:\n$$ \\text{Rate of Elimination} = k \\cdot A(t) = k \\cdot (C(t) \\cdot V) $$\n$$ \\text{Rate of Elimination} = \\text{CL} \\cdot C(t) $$\nTherefore:\n$$ \\text{CL} \\cdot C(t) = k \\cdot V \\cdot C(t) $$\nFor any non-zero concentration $C(t)$, we can divide by $C(t)$ to obtain the fundamental relationship:\n$$ \\mathrm{CL} = k \\cdot V $$\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of Half-life**\n\nWe are given the following values for a specific xenobiotic:\n- Volume of distribution, $V = 30\\ \\mathrm{L}$\n- Clearance, $\\mathrm{CL} = 3.0\\ \\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n\nWe need to compute the half-life, $t_{1/2}$.

Second, we must use this function to find the concentration $C$ that yields a specific fractional effect. Let us denote the concentration of the ligand $C$ as $[C]$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Dose-Response Function $E(C)$**\n\nThe fraction of occupied receptors, $Y$, is defined as the ratio of the concentration of the bound receptor complex, $[RC_{n}]$, to the total receptor concentration, $R_{T}$.\nThe total receptor concentration is given as $R_{T} = [R] + [RC_{n}]$, where $[R]$ is the concentration of unbound receptors.\nTherefore, the fractional occupancy is:\n$$Y = \\frac{[RC_{n}]}{R_{T}} = \\frac{[RC_{n}]}{[R] + [RC_{n}]}$$\nThe problem states that the binding process is governed by the law of mass action, with the macroscopic dissociation constant $K_{d}$ defined for the concerted reaction $R + nC \\rightleftharpoons RC_{n}$ as:\n$$K_{d}^{n} = \\frac{[R][C]^{n}}{[RC_{n}]}$$\nWe can rearrange this equilibrium equation to express the unbound receptor concentration $[R]$ in terms of the other species:\n$$[R] = \\frac{K_{d}^{n} [RC_{n}]}{[C]^{n}}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for the fractional occupancy $Y$:\n$$Y = \\frac{[RC_{n}]}{\\left(\\frac{K_{d}^{n} [RC_{n}]}{[C]^{n}}\\right) + [RC_{n}]}$$\nThe term $[RC_{n}]$ appears in the numerator and in both terms of the denominator, so it can be canceled:\n$$Y = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{d}^{n}}{[C]^{n}} + 1}$$\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $[C]^{n}$:\n$$Y = \\frac{[C]^{n}}{K_{d}^{n} + [C]^{n}}$$\nThis equation, known as the Hill-Langmuir equation, describes the fractional receptor occupancy as a function of ligand concentration.\n\nThe toxic effect, $E$, is stated to be directly proportional to the fractional receptor occupancy $Y$, with the maximal effect $E_{\\max}$ as the proportionality constant:\n$$E([C]) = E_{\\max} \\, Y$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $Y$, we obtain the dose-response function. For notational convenience, let $C$ represent the ligand concentration $[C]$:\n$$E(C) = E_{\\max} \\frac{C^{n}}{K_{d}^{n} + C^{n}}$$\nThis is the required sigmoidal dose-response function, commonly known as the Hill equation. The parameters shape the curve as follows:\n- $E_{\\max}$: This is the maximal attainable effect, representing the asymptotic value of $E(C)$ as $C \\rightarrow \\infty$. It determines the vertical scale of the dose-response curve.\n- $n$: This is the Hill coefficient, which describes the cooperativity of the binding process. If $n > 1$, the binding is positively cooperative, resulting in a steeper, more switch-like sigmoidal curve. If $n  1$, the binding is negatively cooperative, yielding a shallower curve. If $n = 1$, there is no cooperativity, and the equation simplifies to the standard Michaelis-Menten form.\n- $K_{d}$: This is the macroscopic dissociation constant. It is the concentration of ligand required to occupy half of the total receptor sites. To confirm this, if we set $C = K_{d}$, the fractional occupancy $Y$ becomes $Y = \\frac{K_{d}^{n}}{K_{d}^{n} + K_{d}^{n}} = \\frac{1}{2}$. The concentration that produces a half-maximal effect is denoted as $\\text{EC}_{50}$. Since the effect $E$ is proportional to $Y$, a half-maximal occupancy ($Y=\\frac{1}{2}$) corresponds to a half-maximal effect ($E = \\frac{1}{2} E_{\\max}$). Therefore, we have the critical identity $\\text{EC}_{50} = K_{d}$.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of Concentration for a Fractional Effect $q$**\n\nWe are asked to find the concentration $C$ that produces an effect equal to a fraction $q$ of the maximum effect, where $0  q  1$. This condition is expressed as:\n$$E(C) = q \\, E_{\\max}$$\nUsing the derived dose-response function, we have:\n$$q \\, E_{\\max} = E_{\\max} \\frac{C^{n}}{K_{d}^{n} + C^{n}}$$\nSince $E_{\\max}$ is a non-zero constant for any meaningful toxic effect, we can divide both sides by $E_{\\max}$:\n$$q = \\frac{C^{n}}{K_{d}^{n} + C^{n}}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in terms of the half-maximal effective concentration, $\\text{EC}_{50}$. As established in Part 1, $K_{d} = \\text{EC}_{50}$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$q = \\frac{C^{n}}{\\text{EC}_{50}^{n} + C^{n}}$$\nWe now solve this equation for $C$. First, multiply both sides by the denominator:\n$$q (\\text{EC}_{50}^{n} + C^{n}) = C^{n}$$\nDistribute $q$ on the left side:\n$$q \\, \\text{EC}_{50}^{n} + q \\, C^{n} = C^{n}$$\nIsolate the terms containing $C^{n}$:\n$$q \\, \\text{EC}_{50}^{n} = C^{n} - q \\, C^{n}$$\nFactor out $C^{n}$:\n$$q \\, \\text{EC}_{50}^{n} = C^{n} (1-q)$$\nSolve for $C^{n}$:\n$$C^{n} = \\text{EC}_{50}^{n} \\left( \\frac{q}{1-q} \\right)$$\nFinally, take the $n$-th root of both sides to solve for $C$:\n$$C = \\left[ \\text{EC}_{50}^{n} \\left( \\frac{q}{1-q} \\right) \\right]^{\\frac{1}{n}}$$\n$$C = \\text{EC}_{50} \\left( \\frac{q}{1-q} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}}$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the concentration $C$ required to achieve a fractional effect $q$ in terms of $\\text{EC}_{50}$ and the Hill coefficient $n$.
