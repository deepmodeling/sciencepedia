The receptor binding is characterized by a dissociation constant $K_{A}$ with $pK_{A} = -\\log_{10}(K_{A})$.

We will then use this relationship to compute the $EC_{50}$ and the fractional receptor occupancy ($y$) at this concentration for the given parameters.\n\nThe problem defines the system using three core equations:\n1.  **Receptor Binding (Hill-Langmuir):** The fractional receptor occupancy, $y$, at an agonist concentration $[A]$ is given by:\n    $$ y = \\frac{[A]}{[A] + K_A} $$\n2.  **Stimulus Generation:** The stimulus, $S$, is directly proportional to the occupancy:\n    $$ S = \\tau y $$\n3.  **Effect Transduction:** The observed effect, $E$, is a hyperbolic function of the stimulus:\n    $$ E = E_m \\frac{S}{1 + S} $$\n    where $E_m$ is the maximal possible response of the system.\n\nFirst, let's derive the general expression for $EC_{50}$. The problem states that $EC_{50}$ is the concentration $[A]$ that produces half of the agonist's own maximal effect, $E_{\\max}$. For a full agonist in this model, the maximal effect is achieved as $[A] \\to \\infty$, which causes occupancy $y \\to 1$.
