According to the Law of Mass Action, the equilibrium dissociation constant ($K_D$) is defined as:\n$$K_D = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\nwhere $[R]$, $[L]$, and $[RL]$ are the molar concentrations of free receptors, free ligand, and receptor-ligand complexes at equilibrium, respectively.\n\nIn the context of the provided problem:\n- The concentration of free ligand, $[L]$, is denoted by $F$.\n- The concentration of the receptor-ligand complex, $[RL]$, corresponds to the specific bound ligand, denoted by $B$.\n- The total concentration of receptors, or the maximum binding capacity ($B_{max}$), is the sum of free and bound receptors: $B_{max} = [R] + [RL]$.\n\nFrom this, the concentration of free receptors can be expressed as $[R] = B_{max} - B$. Substituting these terms into the $K_D$ equation yields the fundamental equation for saturation binding:\n$$K_D = \\frac{(B_{max} - B)F}{B}$$\nTo derive the Scatchard equation, we rearrange this expression to solve for the ratio of bound to free ligand, $B/F$:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Multiply both sides by $B$: $K_D B = (B_{max} - B)F$\n    \\item Distribute $F$ on the right side: $K_D B = B_{max}F - B F$\n    \\item Divide all terms by $F$: $\\frac{K_D B}{F} = B_{max} - B$\n    \\item Divide by $K_D$: $\\frac{B}{F} = \\frac{B_{max}}{K_D} - \\frac{1}{K_D}B$\n\\end{enumerate}\nThis final expression is the Scatchard equation.

The cellular response, $E$, is a function of a stimulus, $S$, such that $E = g(S)$. The maximal response of the tissue is $E_{\\max}$. A stimulus is generated when an agonist binds to a receptor. At a saturating concentration of an agonist, all receptors are occupied, and the stimulus generated is proportional to the total number of functional receptors, $[R_T]$, and the intrinsic efficacy, $\\epsilon$, of the agonist.\nThus, the maximal stimulus generated by an agonist is $S_{\\text{agonist}} = \\epsilon \\cdot [R_T]$.\n\n-   **Full Agonist (A):** Agonist $A$ has high intrinsic efficacy, $\\epsilon_A$. It can generate a maximal stimulus $S_A = \\epsilon_A \\cdot [R_T]$. By definition, a full agonist can elicit the maximal tissue response, $E_{\\max}$.\n-   **Partial Agonist (P):** Agonist $P$ has lower intrinsic efficacy, $\\epsilon_P  \\epsilon_A$. It generates a maximal stimulus $S_P = \\epsilon_P \\cdot [R_T]$. A partial agonist cannot elicit $E_{\\max}$ in a system without spare receptors.\n-   **Spare Receptors (Receptor Reserve):** The concept of spare receptors implies that the stimulus required to achieve $E_{\\max}$, let's call it $S_{\\text{req}}$, is less than the maximum possible stimulus the full agonist can generate. That is, $S_{\\text{req}}  S_A = \\epsilon_A \\cdot [R_T]$. The full agonist does not need to activate all receptors to achieve $E_{\\max}$.\n-   **Effect of Receptor Inactivation:** When a fraction $f$ of receptors is irreversibly inactivated (or desensitized), the total number of functional receptors is reduced to $[R_T]' = (1-f)[R_T]$.\n    -   The new maximal stimulus for the full agonist is $S_A' = \\epsilon_A \\cdot (1-f)[R_T]$. As long as $S_A' \\ge S_{\\text{req}}$, the full agonist can still produce $E_{\\max}$. However, to generate any given stimulus level below the new maximum, a larger fraction of the *remaining* receptors must be occupied, which requires a higher agonist concentration. This manifests as an increase in the half-maximal effective concentration, $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$. Once $f$ is large enough that $S_A'  S_{\\text{req}}$, the full agonist's maximal response will also decrease.\n    -   The new maximal stimulus for the partial agonist is $S_P' = \\epsilon_P \\cdot (1-f)[R_T]$. Since a partial agonist is typically stimulus-limited (i.e., $S_P  S_{\\text{req}}$ or only barely meets it), any reduction in $[R_T]$ will cause a decrease in its maximal stimulus $S_P'$, which in turn leads to a decrease in its observed maximal response, $E_{P, \\max}$.\n\nWith these principles established, we can evaluate each option.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Treat the tissue with an irreversible antagonist that inactivates a fraction $f$ of receptors ($0f1$), then record concentration–response curves for $A$ and $P$. If spare receptors are present, $A$ will initially show a rightward shift in half-maximal effective concentration ($\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$) with minimal change in $E_{\\max}$ until $f$ exceeds the reserve, whereas $P$ will show a decrease in $E_{\\max}$ even for small $f$. This pattern supports the presence of spare receptors.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** This statement describes the classic experimental method for demonstrating the presence of spare receptors.\n    -   For the full agonist $A$, the receptor reserve allows the system to absorb a partial loss of receptors without a loss in maximal response ($E_{\\max}$). The system compensates by requiring a higher concentration of $A$ to achieve the necessary stimulus, leading to a rightward shift in the concentration-response curve (increased $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$).\n    -   For the partial agonist $P$, which has lower intrinsic efficacy, there is little to no stimulus reserve. Any loss of receptors leads to a proportional loss in the maximal stimulus it can generate, resulting in an immediate decrease in its maximal response.\n    -   This differential effect is the hallmark of a system with spare receptors for the full agonist.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Induce homologous desensitization by a short pre-exposure to $A$ and then record concentration–response curves. If spare receptors were present at baseline, the difference between $E_{\\max}$ for $A$ and $P$ will increase after desensitization, because the partial agonist’s $E_{\\max}$ declines more steeply with loss of functional receptors than the full agonist’s.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** Homologous desensitization results in the inactivation or downregulation of receptors, which is functionally equivalent to the effect of the irreversible antagonist in option A. It reduces the total number of available functional receptors, $[R_T]$.\n    -   At baseline (with spare receptors), the difference in maximal responses is $\\Delta E_1 = E_{A, \\max} - E_{P, \\max}$.\n    -   After desensitization, $[R_T]$ is reduced. The maximal response of the partial agonist, $E_{P, \\max}$, will decrease significantly. The maximal response of the full agonist, $E_{A, \\max}$, will decrease less steeply, or not at all, as long as the receptor reserve is not fully depleted.\n    -   Therefore, the new difference, $\\Delta E_2 = E'_{A, \\max} - E'_{P, \\max}$, will be larger than the initial difference $\\Delta E_1$. The reasoning provided—that the partial agonist's $E_{\\max}$ declines more steeply—is precisely correct.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. In a system without spare receptors, co-applying $P$ with $A$ at high concentrations will increase $A$’s $E_{\\max}$ by mitigating tachyphylaxis through competition for receptors.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** This statement is incorrect. A partial agonist ($P$), when co-applied with a full agonist ($A$), competes for the same binding site. Since $P$ has lower intrinsic efficacy ($\\epsilon_P  \\epsilon_A$), a receptor bound by $P$ generates a smaller stimulus than a receptor bound by $A$. The net effect of co-application is a reduction in the total stimulus generated at any given concentration of $A$, effectively making $P$ a competitive antagonist in the presence of $A$. This will *decrease*, not increase, the maximal response achievable by $A$ compared to saturating $A$ alone. The claim about mitigating tachyphylaxis to increase $E_{\\max}$ is pharmacologically unsound; the primary effect is competitive antagonism.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Using a reversible competitive antagonist to reduce apparent receptor availability is indistinguishable from homologous desensitization with respect to effects on $E_{\\max}$ and $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ for a full agonist, so either can diagnose spare receptors in the same way.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** This statement incorrectly equates two distinct pharmacological phenomena.\n    -   A **reversible competitive antagonist** causes a parallel rightward shift in the agonist's concentration-response curve without depressing the maximum response ($E_{\\max}$), provided the antagonist concentration is not insurmountably high. It reduces the agonist's potency (increases $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$) but does not affect its efficacy.\n    -   **Homologous desensitization** (or an irreversible antagonist) reduces the number of functional receptors. This causes a rightward shift in the $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ *and*, upon sufficient receptor loss, a depression of the $E_{\\max}$.\n    -   These two mechanisms produce different patterns on concentration-response curves and are pharmacologically distinguishable. Therefore, they are not interchangeable for diagnostic purposes in this context.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. If spare receptors are abundant at baseline, $P$ can produce an $E_{\\max}$ similar to $A$. After a uniform fractional loss of functional receptors due to desensitization, $P$’s $E_{\\max}$ will fall below $A$’s, while $A$ may still achieve near-maximal response, thereby unmasking the difference in efficacy and revealing the prior spare receptor status.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** This describes a key implication of having a large receptor reserve. If the stimulus required for $E_{\\max}$ is very low, even a partial agonist with its lower intrinsic efficacy might generate a sufficient stimulus ($S_P = \\epsilon_P \\cdot [R_T] \\ge S_{\\text{req}}$) to produce a response that is indistinguishable from the system's maximum. In such a case, the partial agonist would be operationally classified as a full agonist in that specific tissue. When receptors are removed (e.g., via desensitization), the maximal stimulus for both agonists is reduced. Since $\\epsilon_P  \\epsilon_A$, the maximal stimulus from $P$ will fall below the required threshold ($S_P'  S_{\\text{req}}$) before the maximal stimulus from $A$ does ($S_A'$ may still be $\\ge S_{\\text{req}}$). This reduction in receptor number \"unmasks\" the lower intrinsic efficacy of $P$, causing its maximal response to fall while $A$'s maximal response remains high. This is a valid description of how receptor loss can reveal latent differences in efficacy.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABE}$$", "id": "4986166"}]}
