This means the apparent dissociation constant $K_A'$ is decreased: $K_A' = K_A / \\alpha$.\n- The efficacy of $A$ is increased by a factor of $\\beta$. This modifies the transduction ratio: $\\tau' = \\tau \\beta$.\n\nThe response equation in the presence of the PAM is:\n$$E_{\\text{PAM}} = \\frac{\\tau' [A]}{K_A' + (1+\\tau')[A]}$$\nSubstituting the modified parameters and the condition $[A] = K_A$:\n$$E_{\\text{PAM}} = \\frac{(\\tau \\beta) K_A}{(K_A / \\alpha) + (1 + \\tau \\beta)K_A} = \\frac{(\\tau \\beta) K_A}{K_A (1/\\alpha + 1 + \\tau \\beta)} = \\frac{\\tau \\beta}{1/\\alpha + 1 + \\tau \\beta}$$\n\nWe now compute the PAM-potentiated response for both systems using $\\alpha = 2$ and $\\beta = 1.2$:\n- For the low reserve system with $\\tau_1 = 0.3$:\n  $$E_{\\text{PAM}, 1} = \\frac{0.3 \\cdot 1.2}{1/2 + 1 + (0.3 \\cdot 1.2)} = \\frac{0.36}{0.5 + 1 + 0.36} = \\frac{0.36}{1.86} \\approx 0.19355$$\n- For the high reserve system with $\\tau_2 = 3.0$:\n  $$E_{\\text{PAM}, 2} = \\frac{3.0 \\cdot 1.2}{1/2 + 1 + (3.0 \\cdot 1.2)} = \\frac{3.6}{0.5 + 1 + 3.6} = \\frac{3.6}{5.1} \\approx 0.70588$$\n\n**3.
