When conducting $m$ simultaneous hypothesis tests, using a conventional significance level $\\alpha$ for each test independently (e.g., rejecting the null hypothesis if $p \\le \\alpha$) leads to an inflation of the overall Type I error rate. For instance, the probability of making at least one false rejection, known as the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER), increases with the number of tests. In large-scale screening, such as in pharmacovigilance, controlling the FWER is often too conservative and may lead to missing real signals.\n\nAn alternative is to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR), defined as the expected proportion of false rejections (Type I errors) among all rejections. Let $V$ be the number of true null hypotheses that are incorrectly rejected (false discoveries), and let $R$ be the total number of rejected hypotheses. The False Discovery Proportion (FDP) is $FDP = V/R$ (with $FDP=0$ if $R=0$). The FDR is the expectation of this quantity: $FDR = E[FDP]$.

The adjusted $p$-value for the $i$-th ordered test, $p_{(i)}^{adj}$, can be interpreted as the smallest FDR level $q$ at which the test would be declared significant. It is computed for each ordered $p$-value $p_{(i)}$ and enforces monotonicity. The formula for the $i$-th adjusted $p$-value is:\n$$p_{(i)}^{adj} = \\min_{j=i, \\dots, m} \\left( \\min \\left( 1, \\frac{m}{j} p_{(j)} \\right) \\right)$$\nA practical way to compute this is to first calculate the intermediate values $p}_{(i)}' = \\frac{m}{i} p_{(i)}$ for $i=1, \\dots, m$, and then enforce the non-decreasing order by taking a cumulative minimum from the end.\nLet's compute $p_{(i)}' = \\frac{10}{i} p_{(i)}$ for each $i$:\n$p_{(10)}' = \\frac{10}{10}(0.40) = 0.40$\n$p_{(9)}' = \\frac{10}{9}(0.20) = \\frac{2}{9} \\approx 0.222$\n$p_{(8)}' = \\frac{10}{8}(0.12) = 0.15$\n$p_{(7)}' = \\frac{10}{7}(0.08) = \\frac{0.8}{7} \\approx 0.114$\n$p_{(6)}' = \\frac{10}{6}(0.06) = 0.10$\n$p_{(5)}' = \\frac{10}{5}(0.04) = 0.08$\n$p_{(4)}' = \\frac{10}{4}(0.02) = 0.05$\n$p_{(3)}' = \\frac{10}{3}(0.012) = 0.04$\n$p_{(2)}' = \\frac{10}{2}(0.006) = 0.03$\n$p_{(1)}' = \\frac{10}{1}(0.001) = 0.01$\n\nNow we enforce monotonicity. Let $p_{(i)}^{adj} = \\min(p_{(i+1)}^{adj}, p_{(i)}')$ for $i=m-1, \\dots, 1$, starting with $p_{(m)}^{adj} = p_{(m)}'$.\n$p_{(10)}^{adj} = p_{(10)}' = 0.40$\n$p_{(9)}^{adj} = \\min(p_{(10)}^{adj}, p_{(9)}') = \\min(0.40, \\frac{2}{9}) = \\frac{2}{9}$\n$p_{(8)}^{adj} = \\min(p_{(9)}^{adj}, p_{(8)}') = \\min(\\frac{2}{9}, 0.15) = 0.15$\n$p_{(7)}^{adj} = \\min(p_{(8)}^{adj}, p_{(7)}') = \\min(0.15, \\frac{0.8}{7}) = \\frac{0.8}{7} = \\frac{4}{35}$\n$p_{(6)}^{adj} = \\min(p_{(7)}^{adj}, p_{(6)}') = \\min(\\frac{4}{35}, 0.10) = 0.10$\n$p_{(5)}^{adj} = \\min(p_{(6)}^{adj}, p_{(5)}') = \\min(0.10, 0.08) = 0.08$\n$p_{(4)}^{adj} = \\min(p_{(5)}^{adj}, p_{(4)}') = \\min(0.08, 0.05) = 0.05$\n$p_{(3)}^{adj} = \\min(p_{(4)}^{adj}, p_{(3)}') = \\min(0.05, 0.04) = 0.04$\n$p_{(2)}^{adj} = \\min(p_{(3)}^{adj}, p_{(2)}') = \\min(0.04, 0.03) = 0.03$\n$p_{(1)}^{adj} = \\min(p_{(2)}^{adj}, p_{(1)}') = \\min(0.03, 0.01) = 0.01$\n\nThe full set of BH-adjusted $p$-values is:\n$p_{(1)}^{adj}=0.01, p_{(2)}^{adj}=0.03, p_{(3)}^{adj}=0.04, p_{(4)}^{adj}=0.05, p_{(5)}^{adj}=0.08, p_{(6)}^{adj}=0.10, p_{(7)}^{adj}=\\frac{4}{35}, p_{(8)}^{adj}=0.15, p_{(9)}^{adj}=\\frac{2}{9}, p_{(10)}^{adj}=0.40$.\n\nUsing these adjusted $p$-values, the rejection rule is to reject all hypotheses for which $p_{(i)}^{adj} \\le q$. With $q=0.05$, we reject the hypotheses corresponding to $p_{(1)}, p_{(2)}, p_{(3)},$ and $p_{(4)}$, since their adjusted $p$-values are $0.01, 0.03, 0.04,$ and $0.05$, respectively, all of which are less than or equal to $0.05$. This confirms that $4$ hypotheses are rejected.\n\nThe final answer is the total number of rejected hypotheses.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "4978956"}]}
