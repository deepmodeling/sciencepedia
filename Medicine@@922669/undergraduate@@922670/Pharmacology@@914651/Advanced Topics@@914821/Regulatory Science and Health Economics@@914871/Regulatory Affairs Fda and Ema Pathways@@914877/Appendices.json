It is scientifically grounded in established principles of toxicology and carcinogen risk assessment, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objective in its formulation. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe objective is to derive the Permitted Daily Exposure ($PDE$) for a mutagenic impurity based on its carcinogenic potency, expressed as the $TD_{50}$, and a target lifetime excess cancer risk, $R^*$. The derivation will be based on the one-hit model of carcinogenesis, which assumes a linear dose-response relationship at low doses.\n\nLet $d$ represent the chronic daily dose rate of the impurity, in units of $\\mathrm{mg\\,kg^{-1}\\,day^{-1}}$.\nLet $P(d)$ be the probability of an individual remaining tumor-free over a standard lifespan when exposed to a chronic daily dose $d$. The one-hit model, which is a low-dose linearization of more complex models like the multistage model, describes this probability. The core assumption is that the hazard rate of developing a tumor is linear with dose. The probability of remaining tumor-free can be expressed as:\n$$P(d) = P(0) \\exp(-k d)$$\nwhere $P(0)$ is the background probability of remaining tumor-free (i.e., at dose $d=0$) and $k$ is the carcinogenic potency parameter, or slope factor, with units of $(\\mathrm{dose})^{-1}$.\n\nThe excess lifetime cancer risk, $R(d)$, is the additional probability of developing a tumor due to the exposure, conditional on surviving other causes of death. It is defined as:\n$$R(d) = 1 - \\frac{P(d)}{P(0)}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(d)$:\n$$R(d) = 1 - \\frac{P(0) \\exp(-k d)}{P(0)} = 1 - \\exp(-k d)$$\nFor small doses, where $k d \\ll 1$, we can use the Taylor series expansion $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1 - x$. This yields the linear low-dose approximation:\n$$R(d) \\approx 1 - (1 - k d) = k d$$\nSo, the risk is directly proportional to the dose: $R(d) = k d$. Our goal is to find the value of the potency parameter $k$.\n\nThe problem provides the $TD_{50}$, defined as the chronic daily dose rate that halves the probability of remaining tumor-free over a standard lifespan. Mathematically, this definition is:\n$$P(TD_{50}) = \\frac{1}{2} P(0)$$\nWe can use this definition in our model's equation for $P(d)$:\n$$P(0) \\exp(-k \\cdot TD_{50}) = \\frac{1}{2} P(0)$$\nDividing both sides by $P(0)$ (which is non-zero) gives:\n$$\\exp(-k \\cdot TD_{50}) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nTo solve for $k$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-k \\cdot TD_{50} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\ln(2)$$\nSolving for the potency parameter $k$:\n$$k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{TD_{50}}$$\nNow we can substitute this expression for $k$ back into our linear risk equation $R(d) = k d$:\n$$R(d) = \\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{TD_{50}}\\right) d$$\nThe problem specifies a target lifetime excess cancer risk, $R^*$.

The analysis will be performed on the natural logarithm-transformed pharmacokinetic (PK) data using the Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) procedure.\n\nFirst, we formalize the problem in the context of statistical hypothesis testing. The goal is to demonstrate that the ratio of geometric means for the test ($T$) and reference ($R$) products lies within the equivalence margin of $[0.80, 1.25]$. This is expressed as:\n$$\n\\theta_L \\le \\frac{\\mu_T}{\\mu_R} \\le \\theta_U\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_T$ and $\\mu_R$ are the geometric means of the PK metric for the test and reference products, respectively. The specified limits are $\\theta_L = 0.80$ and $\\theta_U = 1.25$.\n\nIt is standard practice to perform the statistical analysis on the natural logarithm scale. Let $Y$ be the log-transformed PK metric. The difference in means on the log scale, $\\mu_d = E[\\ln(T)] - E[\\ln(R)]$, is equal to the logarithm of the geometric mean ratio, $\\mu_d = \\ln(\\mu_T/\\mu_R)$. The equivalence hypothesis on the log scale becomes:\n$$\n\\ln(\\theta_L) \\le \\mu_d \\le \\ln(\\theta_U)\n$$\nSubstituting the given values, the acceptance interval for $\\mu_d$ is $[\\ln(0.80), \\ln(1.25)]$. Since $\\ln(0.80) = \\ln(4/5) = -\\ln(5/4) = -\\ln(1.25)$, the interval is symmetric around zero. We define the equivalence limit on the log scale as $\\Delta = \\ln(1.25) \\approx 0.2231$. The acceptance interval is therefore $[-\\Delta, \\Delta]$.\n\nThe problem specifies an expected geometric mean ratio of $\\theta = 0.95$. On the log scale, this corresponds to a true mean difference of $\\mu_d = \\ln(0.95) \\approx -0.0513$.\n\nThe intra-subject coefficient of variation, $\\mathrm{CV}_{w}$, on the original scale is related to the within-subject variance, $\\sigma_w^2$, of the log-transformed data. Assuming the log-transformed data are normally distributed, the relationship is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_w^2 = \\ln(1 + \\mathrm{CV}_{w}^2)\n$$\nWith the given $\\mathrm{CV}_{w} = 0.50$, the within-subject variance is:\n$$\n\\sigma_w^2 = \\ln(1 + 0.50^2) = \\ln(1.25) \\approx 0.2231\n$$\nBy coincidence, this value is the same as the equivalence limit $\\Delta$.\n\nThe TOST procedure involves testing two one-sided null hypotheses:\n$H_{01}: \\mu_d \\ge \\Delta$\n$H_{02}: \\mu_d \\le -\\Delta$\nTo conclude bioequivalence, both null hypotheses must be rejected at a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$. This is equivalent to showing that the $100(1-2\\alpha)\\% = 90\\%$ confidence interval for $\\mu_d$ is entirely contained within the interval $[-\\Delta, \\Delta]$.\n\nFor a $2 \\times 2$ crossover study with total sample size $n$, the estimated mean difference $\\hat{\\mu}_d$ is approximately normally distributed with mean $\\mu_d$ and variance $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\mu}_d) = \\frac{2\\sigma_w^2}{n}$. The standard error is $\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\mu}_d) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma_w^2}{n}}$.\n\nThe statistical power of the study is the probability of correctly rejecting both $H_{01}$ and $H_{02}$ when there is a true difference $\\mu_d$. The power is limited by the test for the boundary that is closer to the true mean $\\mu_d$. The distance from $\\mu_d = \\ln(0.95)$ to the upper boundary $\\Delta = \\ln(1.25)$ is $\\Delta - \\mu_d = \\ln(1.25) - \\ln(0.95) = \\ln(1.25/0.95) \\approx 0.2744$. The distance from $\\mu_d$ to the lower boundary $-\\Delta = \\ln(0.80)$ is $\\mu_d - (-\\Delta) = \\mu_d + \\Delta = \\ln(0.95) + \\ln(1.25) = \\ln(0.95 \\times 1.25) = \\ln(1.1875) \\approx 0.1719$. Since the distance to the lower boundary is smaller, the power is primarily determined by the ability to reject $H_{02}: \\mu_d \\le -\\Delta$.\n\nThe power for the TOST procedure can be approximated by the power of this limiting test. We use the normal approximation for the test statistics. The power to reject $H_{02}$ is the probability of observing an estimate $\\hat{\\mu}_d$ that is sufficiently far from the boundary $-\\Delta$. The test rejects $H_{02}$ if $\\hat{\\mu}_d > -\\Delta + z_\\alpha \\cdot \\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\mu}_d)$.

For HVDs, regulatory agencies like the FDA and EMA allow for Reference-Scaled Average Bioequivalence (RSABE) procedures. RSABE uses a replicate design (e.g., three- or four-period crossover) to estimate the within-subject variability of the reference product ($\\sigma_{wR}^2$) and widens the acceptance limits based on this estimate. This approach helps manage the large sample sizes often required for HVDs under fixed limits. The problem, however, specifies that a standard $2 \\times 2$ crossover design is chosen. A sponsor might make this choice for reasons of operational simplicity, lower cost per subject, or if the drug has a long half-life that makes replicate designs with multiple periods infeasible. In such a case, the sponsor accepts the consequence of potentially needing a larger sample size than for a non-HVD, and the calculation using the fixed limits $[0.80, 1.25]$ is the appropriate one.\n\nWe now compute the minimal sample size using the derived formula.\nGiven values are:\n- $\\alpha = 0.05$, so $z_\\alpha = z_{0.05} \\approx 1.64485$.\n- $1-\\beta = 0.90 \\implies \\beta = 0.10$, so $z_\\beta = z_{0.10} \\approx 1.28155$.\n- $\\sigma_w^2 = \\ln(1.25) \\approx 0.22314$.\n- $\\mu_d + \\Delta = \\ln(0.95) + \\ln(1.25) = \\ln(1.1875) \\approx 0.17185$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$\nn \\ge \\frac{2 \\cdot \\ln(1.25) (z_{0.05} + z_{0.10})^2}{(\\ln(1.1875))^2}\n$$\n$$\nn \\ge \\frac{2 \\cdot (0.22314) (1.64485 + 1.28155)^2}{(0.17185)^2}\n$$\n$$\nn \\ge \\frac{0.44628 \\cdot (2.9264)^2}{0.029533}\n$$\n$$\nn \\ge \\frac{0.44628 \\cdot 8.5638}{0.029533}\n$$\n$$\nn \\ge \\frac{3.8218}{0.029533} \\approx 129.41\n$$\nThe total sample size $n$ must be an integer.

The fundamental base includes: (i) the requirement that the benefit–risk balance must be positive to grant any authorisation; (ii) the standard expectation of “comprehensive” quality, non-clinical, and clinical data for a normal marketing authorisation; and (iii) specific legal constructs that permit approval with non-standard evidence when justified. Two constructs are relevant: Conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA), intended when comprehensive data can reasonably be expected to be supplied post-approval within an agreed timeframe, and Marketing Authorisation under Exceptional Circumstances (EC), intended when comprehensive data cannot be obtained even after approval due to ultra-rarity, ethical constraints, or the state of scientific knowledge. Under Exceptional Circumstances, residual uncertainties must be managed by obligations such as specific risk minimisation, targeted Post-Authorisation Safety Study (PASS) and Post-Authorisation Efficacy Study (PAES), registries, and periodic reassessment.\n\nApplying these principles to the scenario:\n\n- The disease is ultra-rare (prevalence $<1$ per $10^{6}$, global living patients $<150$), with rapid progression and median untreated survival $<2$ years, making 1:1 randomisation ethically contentious and logistically infeasible.\n- The clinical evidence uses a single-arm design with a pre-specified, quality-assured natural history external control, adjusted via propensity scoring, yielding a hazard ratio of $0.40$ with $95\\%$ confidence interval $0.22$–$0.72$, which supports a clinically meaningful effect under severe constraints.\n- A mechanistic biomarker improves from $5\\%$ to $45\\%$ of normal at $6$ months and correlates with short-term clinical outcomes, triangulating efficacy.\n- Long-term risks (e.g., insertional mutagenesis) remain unknown, necessitating structured long-term follow-up and targeted safety surveillance.\n\nTherefore, the pathway that best fits is Exceptional Circumstances, not because it lowers the standard of evidence arbitrarily, but because it recognises that comprehensive confirmatory data cannot realistically be obtained, and mandates robust alternative sources plus strict obligations.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Conditional Marketing Authorisation requires that comprehensive, confirmatory data can feasibly be generated post-approval within a defined period (e.g., a Phase $3$ RCT within $3$ years).

It also sets out a proportionate Risk Management Plan (RMP) with an international registry, PASS for long-term vector risks, PAES to study durability with clinically meaningful outcomes and validated surrogates, additional risk minimisation, annual Periodic Benefit–Risk Evaluation Reports, ongoing CMC tightening, and annual benefit–risk re-evaluation by the European Medicines Agency.

Accelerated Assessment shortens the review clock but does not alter the evidence standard. Proposing to accept lower manufacturing control at approval and to rely solely on a biomarker without external controls while waiving registries and limiting to routine pharmacovigilance undercuts robustness. It does not address the central question of persistent infeasibility of comprehensive data, and it weakens risk controls. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. Compassionate Use or Named Patient supply are access mechanisms managed by Member States and are not substitutes for a centralised marketing authorisation.
