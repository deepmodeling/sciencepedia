To answer this, we need a quantitative framework. This practice introduces the three core metrics used in cost-effectiveness analysis: the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), the Net Monetary Benefit (NMB), and the Net Health Benefit (NHB). By working through this problem [@problem_id:4970963], you will learn how to calculate these values and use them in conjunction with a willingness-to-pay threshold to make a clear and justifiable decision about a new therapy.", "problem": "A health technology assessment body is evaluating a new chronic disease therapy (Drug A) versus standard care from a payer perspective over a lifetime horizon. The incremental analysis comparing Drug A to standard care yields an estimated incremental cost of $\\$15,000$ and an incremental effectiveness of $0.5$ Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs).

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of pharmacoeconomics, well-posed with all necessary information, and objective in its formulation.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of three standard cost-effectiveness metrics and a subsequent adoption decision. The given values are:\n- Incremental cost, $\\Delta C = \\$15,000$\n- Incremental effectiveness, $\\Delta E = 0.5$ Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)\n- Willingness-to-pay threshold, $\\lambda = \\$50,000$ per QALY\n\nThe metrics to be computed are the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), the Net Monetary Benefit (NMB), and the Net Health Benefit (NHB).\n\nFirst, we compute the ICER. The ICER represents the additional cost for each additional unit of health outcome (in this case, QALYs). The formula is:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\$15,000}{0.5 \\text{ QALYs}} = \\$30,000 \\text{ per QALY}\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding to $4$ significant figures. The exact value is $30,000$. To express this with $4$ significant figures, we use scientific notation: $3.000 \\times 10^4$.\n\nSecond, we compute the NMB. The NMB translates the incremental health benefits into monetary terms using the WTP threshold and subtracts the incremental costs. A positive NMB indicates that the intervention is cost-effective. The formula is:\n$$\n\\text{NMB} = (\\lambda \\times \\Delta E) - \\Delta C\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\text{NMB} = (\\$50,000/\\text{QALY} \\times 0.5 \\text{ QALYs}) - \\$15,000 = \\$25,000 - \\$15,000 = \\$10,000\n$$\nThe exact value is $10,000$. To express this with $4$ significant figures, we use scientific notation: $1.000 \\times 10^4$.\n\nThird, we compute the NHB. The NHB translates the incremental costs into an equivalent \"health opportunity cost\" (in QALYs) and subtracts it from the incremental health benefits. A positive NHB indicates that the intervention is cost-effective. The formula is:\n$$\n\\text{NHB} = \\Delta E - \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\lambda}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\text{NHB} = 0.5 \\text{ QALYs} - \\frac{\\$15,000}{\\$50,000/\\text{QALY}} = 0.5 \\text{ QALYs} - 0.3 \\text{ QALYs} = 0.2 \\text{ QALYs}\n$$\nThe exact value is $0.2$. To express this with $4$ significant figures, we write it as $0.2000$.\n\nFinally, we determine the adoption decision. An intervention is considered cost-effective if its ICER is less than or equal to the decision-maker's willingness-to-pay threshold ($\\lambda$).\n$$\n\\text{ICER} \\le \\lambda\n$$\n$$\n\\$30,000/\\text{QALY} \\le \\$50,000/\\text{QALY}\n$$\nThis condition is satisfied. The cost-effectiveness is independently confirmed by the positive NMB ($NMB = \\$10,000 > \\$0$) and the positive NHB ($NHB = 0.2 \\text{ QALYs} > 0 \\text{ QALYs}$). Therefore, Drug A should be adopted. The decision indicator is $1$.\n\nThe final result is a row vector containing the four computed values in the specified order: $\\big[\\text{ICER, NMB, NHB, decision indicator}\\big]$, with the first three quantities rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n- ICER: $3.000 \\times 10^4$\n- NMB: $1.000 \\times 10^4$\n- NHB: $0.2000$\n- Decision indicator: $1$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3.000 \\times 10^4 & 1.000 \\times 10^4 & 0.2000 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4970963"}, {"introduction": "The inputs for a cost-effectiveness analysis, such as lifetime costs and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), are not static figures; they accumulate over time as a patient's health condition evolves.

Analyze the Direction of the Effect and the INMB Range**\n\n-   **Direction:** The relationship between INMB and $u$ is given by $INMB(u) = -5,800 - 10,000u$. The derivative of INMB with respect to $u$ is $\\frac{d(INMB)}{du} = -10,000$. Since this derivative is negative, an increase in the PD utility ($u$) leads to a decrease in the INMB of A versus B. Intuitively, Treatment B involves more time in the PD state ($0.40$ years vs. $0.30$ years for A), so an improvement in the quality of life in that state disproportionately benefits Treatment B, reducing Treatment A's relative value.\n\n-   **Range for INMB:** The one-way sensitivity analysis considers the range for $u$ from $0.30$ to $0.70$.\n    -   At the low value, $u = 0.30$:\n        $$INMB(0.30) = -\\$5,800 - (\\$10,000 \\times 0.30) = -\\$5,800 - \\$3,000 = -\\$8,800$$\n    -   At the high value, $u = 0.70$:\n        $$INMB(0.70) = -\\$5,800 - (\\$10,000 \\times 0.70) = -\\$5,800 - \\$7,000 = -\\$12,800$$\n    The INMB for Treatment A vs B spans from $-\\$12,800$ (when $u=0.70$) to $-\\$8,800$ (when $u=0.30$).\n\n**7. Principles of Tornado Diagrams**\n-   A one-way sensitivity analysis (OWSA) varies one input parameter at a time while keeping all others at their base-case values.\n-   A tornado diagram visualizes the results of OWSA for multiple parameters.\n-   Each parameter gets a horizontal bar representing the range of the model output (here, INMB) as the parameter is varied from its low to high value.\n-   The bars are centered on the base-case model output. The base-case $u$ is $0.50$, so the base-case INMB is $INMB(0.50) = -\\$5,800 - (\\$10,000 \\times 0.50) = -\\$10,800$. The calculated range $[-\\$12,800, -\\$8,800]$ is indeed centered on $-\\$10,800$.\n-   The bars are sorted by their width (the absolute span of the output range), from widest at the top to narrowest at the bottom, identifying the parameters to which the model is most sensitive.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Vary only the PD utility from $0.30$ to $0.70$ while holding all other inputs fixed; increasing PD utility reduces the incremental NMB for A versus B; in the tornado diagram, the bar for PD utility shows the low-to-high incremental NMB range and is ordered by the absolute span across parameters, centered on the base-case incremental NMB. For the given inputs at WTP USD $100,000$ per QALY, the incremental NMB spans from about USD $-12,800$ (at PD utility $0.70$) to about USD $-8,800$ (at PD utility $0.30$).**\n-   The description of OWSA is correct.\n-   The direction of the effect (increasing PD utility reduces INMB) is correct.\n-   The description of the tornado diagram is correct.\n-   The calculated INMB range ($-\\$12,800$ at $u=0.70$ and $-\\$8,800$ at $u=0.30$) is correct.\n-   **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Vary PD utility from $0.30$ to $0.70$ together with PF utility in the same proportion; increasing PD utility increases the incremental NMB for A versus B; tornado bars are sorted by the width of parameter confidence intervals rather than impact on incremental NMB, and for this parameter the incremental NMB goes from about USD $-8,800$ (at PD utility $0.70$) to about USD $-12,800$ (at PD utility $0.30$).**\n-   The specified variation (varying two parameters) is not a one-way sensitivity analysis.\n-   The direction of effect is incorrect.\n-   The description of how tornado bars are sorted is incorrect.\n-   The INMB values are matched to the wrong utility bounds.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Vary only the PD utility from $0.30$ to $0.70$ while holding all other inputs fixed; increasing PD utility increases the incremental NMB for A versus B; tornado bars display the mean incremental NMB for each parameter and are ordered alphabetically by parameter name; for this parameter the incremental NMB spans from about USD $-12,800$ (at PD utility $0.30$) to about USD $-8,800$ (at PD utility $0.70$).**\n-   The direction of effect is incorrect.\n-   The description of the tornado diagram's content and ordering is incorrect.\n-   The INMB values are matched to the wrong utility bounds.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Vary only the PD utility from $0.30$ to $0.70$ while rescaling PF utility so that total QALYs remain constant; tornado bars depict statistical confidence intervals around incremental NMB rather than deterministic ranges; for this parameter there is no change in incremental NMB (it remains near USD $-10,800$ at both bounds) because QALYs are constrained to be unchanged.**\n-   The method described is not a standard OWSA.\n-   The description of tornado bars depicting statistical confidence intervals is false; they show deterministic ranges.\n-   The conclusion of no change in INMB is false, as shown by direct calculation.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Use probabilistic sensitivity analysis by drawing the PD utility from a probability distribution and plot those draws on a tornado diagram; the tornado bar should be centered at zero and has no defined low-to-high range; increasing PD utility has no consistent directional effect on incremental NMB because other parameters are also varying.**\n-   This option incorrectly conflates probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) with deterministic OWSA and its visualization via a tornado diagram.\n-   The description of a tornado bar being centered at zero with no defined range is false.\n-   The claim of no consistent directional effect is incorrect for an OWSA.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4970996"}]}
