It is based on standard epidemiological definitions and real-world regulatory criteria for orphan drug designation. All necessary data are provided, and the objectives are clearly defined. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of three quantities: the absolute expected number of affected individuals ($N$), and two indicator variables, $I_{\\mathrm{EU}}$ and $I_{\\mathrm{US}}$, which represent whether the European Union (EU) and United States (US) orphan drug designation criteria are met, respectively.\n\nFirst, we derive the absolute expected number of affected individuals, $N$, in a given population.\nThe problem provides the following givens:\n-   The point prevalence of the disorder, $r = 0.7$ per $10{,}000$ individuals.\n-   The total national population, $P = 330 \\times 10^{6}$ individuals.\n\nThe problem defines that a prevalence of \"$r$ per $10{,}000$\" corresponds to a prevalence rate, which we denote as $p_{rate}$, of $\\frac{r}{10{,}000}$ cases per person.\n$$p_{rate} = \\frac{r}{10{,}000}$$\nSubstituting the given value for $r$:\n$$p_{rate} = \\frac{0.7}{10{,}000} = 0.00007$$\nThis rate represents the proportion of the population expected to have the disorder.\n\nThe absolute expected number of affected individuals, $N$, in a total population $P$ is the product of the prevalence rate and the total population size:\n$$N = p_{rate} \\times P$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $p_{rate}$ and the value of $P$:\n$$N = \\left(\\frac{0.7}{10{,}000}\\right) \\times (330 \\times 10^{6})$$\n$$N = (0.7 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (330 \\times 10^{6})$$\n$$N = 0.7 \\times 330 \\times 10^{(-4+6)}$$\n$$N = 231 \\times 10^{2}$$\n$$N = 23{,}100$$\nThus, the absolute expected number of affected individuals is $23{,}100$.\n\nNext, we determine the value of the indicator variable $I_{\\mathrm{EU}}$.\nThe EU criterion for orphan designation is that the prevalence of the condition does not exceed $5$ in $10{,}000$ people.
