The primary clinical outcome is the change in systolic blood pressure, denoted by $Y$, measured at $12$ weeks. A mechanistic biomarker, plasma renin activity, denoted by $B$, is measured at week $4$ and is hypothesized to lie on the causal pathway between treatment and the clinical outcome. Because treatment is randomized, the total treatment effect on the clinical outcome can be defined as the difference in the expected clinical outcome $Y$ between treated and control arms. The residual treatment effect after conditioning on the biomarker $B$ is defined as the difference in the expected clinical outcome $Y$ between treated and control arms when holding the biomarker $B$ fixed or otherwise adjusting for $B$ in the statistical model.\n\nFrom a linear model that does not include $B$, the estimated treatment effect indicates that the drug reduces the outcome by $\\Delta_{Y} = 8.4$ units. From a linear model that includes $B$ (and the same baseline covariates), the residual treatment effect after conditioning on $B$ indicates a reduction of $\\Delta_{Y|B} = 3.1$ units.\n\nStarting strictly from the above definitions of the total treatment effect and the residual treatment effect after conditioning on the biomarker, derive an expression for the proportion of the treatment effect explained by the biomarker and then compute its numerical value using the reported reductions $\\Delta_{Y}$ and $\\Delta_{Y|B}$.

The total treatment effect is the difference in expected outcomes between the treated and control arms and is summarized here by the magnitude $\\Delta_{Y}$, where a positive value denotes the magnitude of reduction in $Y$ due to treatment. The residual treatment effect after conditioning on $B$ is the difference in expected outcomes between the treated and control arms when the biomarker is held fixed or adjusted for; this is summarized by $\\Delta_{Y|B}$, a positive value denoting the remaining magnitude of reduction in $Y$ after accounting for $B$.\n\nBy definition, the portion of the treatment effect that is explained by the biomarker corresponds to the part of the total treatment effect that is removed when conditioning on $B$.

Let $A(t)$ be the drug amount in the body at time $t$, $C(t)$ the plasma concentration, $D$ the dose, $CL$ the clearance, and $V$ the volume of distribution.

The indirect response model with inhibitory drug effect on production is\n$$\n\\frac{dB}{dt} = k_{\\text{in}}\\left(1 - E(C(t))\\right) - k_{\\text{out}} B(t).\n$$\nAt baseline in the absence of drug effect, steady state implies $B(0) = B_0$ and $B_0 = k_{\\text{in}}/k_{\\text{out}}$, hence $k_{\\text{in}} = B_0\\,k_{\\text{out}}$.

Use a fixed-step, fourth-order Runge–Kutta method with step size $\\Delta t = 0.01$ hours on a uniform grid.\n- Compute $\\overline{B}$ using the trapezoidal rule on the same grid and then compute $\\Delta R$ as above.\n\nImplementation details.\n\n- All computations must use hours for time, liters for volumes, liters per hour for clearance, and milligrams per liter for concentration. The final risk change $\\Delta R$ is dimensionless and must be returned as a decimal number.\n- Round each $\\Delta R$ to six decimal places for output.\n\nTest suite.\n\nYour program must compute $\\Delta R$ for each of the following parameter sets.

The ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $B(t)$ is solved over the time interval $[0, T_{\\text{end}}]$. A uniform time grid $\\{t_0, t_1, \\dots, t_N\\}$ is established, where $t_0 = 0$, $t_N = T_{\\text{end}}$, and the step size is $\\Delta t = t_{i+1} - t_i = 0.01$ hours.
