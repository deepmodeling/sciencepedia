A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the calculation of the present value ($PV$) of a series of future costs. The specified cost stream is a uniform series of payments made at the end of each period, which is defined as an ordinary annuity. The calculation will be based on first principles of discrete discounting.\n\nLet $C$ be the constant annual cost, $r$ be the annual discount rate, and $n$ be the total number of years over which the cost is incurred. The present value of a single cost $C$ paid at the end of year $t$ is given by the formula:\n\n$$PV_t = \\frac{C}{(1+r)^{t}}$$\n\nThe total present value of the entire cost stream is the sum of the present values of each of the $n$ individual payments. The payments are made at the end of years $t=1, 2, 3, 4, 5$.\n\n$$PV = \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{C}{(1+r)^{t}}$$\n\nThe given values are:\n-   Annual cost $C = 1000$ USD.\n-   Annual discount rate $r = 0.03$.\n-   Number of payments $n = 5$.\n\nSubstituting these into the summation:\n\n$$PV = \\sum_{t=1}^{5} \\frac{1000}{(1+0.03)^{t}}$$\n\nWe can factor out the constant cost $C$:\n\n$$PV = C \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)^{t}$$\n\nThe summation term is a finite geometric series with first term $a = \\frac{1}{1+r}$ and common ratio $q = \\frac{1}{1+r}$. The sum of the first $n$ terms of a geometric series is given by $S_n = a \\frac{1-q^n}{1-q}$.\n\nApplying this formula to our summation:\n$$ \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)^{t} = \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right) \\frac{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)^{n}}{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)} $$\nSimplifying the denominator: $1 - \\frac{1}{1+r} = \\frac{1+r-1}{1+r} = \\frac{r}{1+r}$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the sum:\n$$ \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)^{t} = \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right) \\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}{\\frac{r}{1+r}} = \\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}{r} $$\n\nThis yields the standard formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity:\n\n$$PV = C \\left[ \\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}{r} \\right]$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into this formula:\n$$C = 1000$$\n$$r = 0.03$$\n$$n = 5$$\n\n$$PV = 1000 \\left[ \\frac{1 - (1 + 0.03)^{-5}}{0.03} \\right]$$\n$$PV = 1000 \\left[ \\frac{1 - (1.03)^{-5}}{0.03} \\right]$$\n\nFirst, calculate the term $(1.03)^{-5}$:\n$$(1.03)^{-5} \\approx 0.862608784$$\n\nNext, substitute this value back into the equation:\n$$PV \\approx 1000 \\left[ \\frac{1 - 0.862608784}{0.03} \\right]$$\n$$PV \\approx 1000 \\left[ \\frac{0.137391216}{0.03} \\right]$$\n$$PV \\approx 1000 \\times 4.579707186$$\n$$PV \\approx 4579.707186$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $4579.707186$. The first four significant digits are $4, 5, 7, 9$. The fifth significant digit is $7$. Since $7 \\ge 5$, we round up the fourth significant digit.

Identify Dominated Alternatives**\nNext, we must check for dominance. An alternative is strictly dominated if there is another alternative that is both more effective and less costly. An alternative is extendedly dominated if it has an ICER greater than that of a more effective alternative.\n\nLet's compare the costs and effects of the alternatives in their effectiveness order.\n- Compare Alternative $A$ and Alternative $C$: Alternative $C$ is more effective ($E_C > E_A$) and more costly ($C_C > C_A$). Neither dominates the other.\n- Compare Alternative $C$ and Alternative $B$: Alternative $B$ is more effective than Alternative $C$ ($E_B = 0.80 > E_C = 0.79$). At the same time, Alternative $B$ is less costly than Alternative $C$ ($C_B = \\$12,500 < C_C = \\$14,000$).\n\nSince Alternative $B$ provides a greater health benefit for a lower cost compared to Alternative $C$, Alternative $B$ strictly dominates Alternative $C$.

It is a well-posed quantitative problem grounded in the standard principles of health economics and health technology assessment (HTA). All necessary data and definitions are provided, and the values are realistic.\n\nThe central task is to compute the incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) of a new technology compared to a standard of care. The problem defines INMB as the monetized value of the incremental health gain minus the incremental cost. The health gain is measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), and its monetary value is determined by the societal willingness-to-pay threshold, $\\lambda$.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Incremental effectiveness, $\\Delta \\text{QALY} = 0.45$.

It is the surplus value, expressed in monetary units, after the costs have been accounted for.\n\nAn alternative but equivalent way to evaluate cost-effectiveness is to calculate the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) and compare it to the threshold $\\lambda$. The ICER is defined as:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta \\text{Cost}}{\\Delta \\text{QALY}}\n$$\nA technology is considered cost-effective if its ICER is less than $\\lambda$.
