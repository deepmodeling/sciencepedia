Let $C(t)$ denote the well-mixed plasma concentration. A constant infusion at rate $R_{in}$ (mass per time) is delivered. Elimination follows Michaelis–Menten kinetics, with maximum elimination rate $V_{max}$ (mass per time) and Michaelis constant $K_m$ (mass per volume).

No numerical evaluation or rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the steady-state plasma concentration, $C_{ss}$, for a drug administered via a constant intravenous infusion and eliminated by capacity-limited, Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Furthermore, the conditions for the uniqueness and stability of this steady state must be determined.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the amount of drug, $A(t)$, in a single-compartment model is the mass balance equation:\n$$ \\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = \\text{Rate of input} - \\text{Rate of output} $$\nLet $C(t)$ be the plasma concentration and $V_d$ be the apparent volume of distribution. The amount of drug in the compartment is related to the concentration by $A(t) = V_d C(t)$. The rate of change of the amount is thus $\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = V_d \\frac{dC(t)}{dt}$.\n\nThe given input is a constant infusion at a rate $R_{in}$ (mass per time).\nThe output, or rate of elimination, follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. This rate is given by the expression $\\frac{V_{max} C(t)}{K_m + C(t)}$, where $V_{max}$ is the maximum elimination rate (mass per time) and $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant (mass per volume).\n\nSubstituting these terms into the mass balance equation gives the differential equation for the drug concentration:\n$$ V_d \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = R_{in} - \\frac{V_{max} C(t)}{K_m + C(t)} $$\n\nAt steady state, the concentration is constant, which means its rate of change is zero. The problem states this condition as $\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = 0$. Let $C_{ss}$ denote the steady-state concentration. Applying this condition to the differential equation yields:\n$$ 0 = R_{in} - \\frac{V_{max} C_{ss}}{K_m + C_{ss}} $$\nThis algebraic equation relates the steady-state concentration to the given parameters. We can now solve for $C_{ss}$:\n$$ R_{in} = \\frac{V_{max} C_{ss}}{K_m + C_{ss}} $$\nMultiplying both sides by $(K_m + C_{ss})$ gives:\n$$ R_{in} (K_m + C_{ss}) = V_{max} C_{ss} $$\nExpanding the left side:\n$$ R_{in} K_m + R_{in} C_{ss} = V_{max} C_{ss} $$\nTo solve for $C_{ss}$, we group the terms containing $C_{ss}$:\n$$ R_{in} K_m = V_{max} C_{ss} - R_{in} C_{ss} $$\n$$ R_{in} K_m = (V_{max} - R_{in}) C_{ss} $$\nFinally, dividing by $(V_{max} - R_{in})$ gives the closed-form expression for the steady-state concentration:\n$$ C_{ss} = \\frac{R_{in} K_m}{V_{max} - R_{in}} $$\n\nNext, we must determine the parameter regime under which this steady state is unique and locally asymptotically stable.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the existence and uniqueness of a physically meaningful solution. A concentration must be non-negative, so we require $C_{ss} \\ge 0$. The parameters $R_{in}$, $V_{max}$, and $K_m$ are all physically defined as positive quantities.\nThe numerator, $R_{in} K_m$, is therefore always positive. For $C_{ss}$ to be positive, the denominator must also be positive:\n$$ V_{max} - R_{in} > 0 \\implies R_{in}  V_{max} $$\nIf $R_{in}  V_{max}$, the equation yields a single, unique, positive value for $C_{ss}$.\nIf $R_{in} = V_{max}$, the denominator is zero, implying an infinite concentration. No finite steady state is reached because the infusion rate equals the maximum possible elimination rate.\nIf $R_{in} > V_{max}$, the denominator is negative, yielding a non-physical negative concentration. This indicates that no steady state is possible; the concentration will increase indefinitely because the infusion rate exceeds the body's maximum elimination capacity.\nThus, a unique, physically meaningful steady state exists only when the infusion rate is strictly less than the maximum elimination rate, i.e., $R_{in}  V_{max}$.\n\nNow, we analyze the local asymptotic stability of this steady state. For a one-dimensional autonomous system $\\frac{dC}{dt} = f(C)$, a steady state $C_{ss}$ is locally asymptotically stable if the derivative of $f(C)$ evaluated at $C_{ss}$ is negative, i.e., $f'(C_{ss})  0$.\nOur system is described by:\n$$ f(C) = \\frac{dC}{dt} = \\frac{1}{V_d} \\left( R_{in} - \\frac{V_{max} C}{K_m + C} \\right) $$\nLet's compute the derivative $f'(C)$:\n$$ f'(C) = \\frac{d}{dC} \\left[ \\frac{R_{in}}{V_d} - \\frac{V_{max} C}{V_d (K_m + C)} \\right] $$\n$$ f'(C) = 0 - \\frac{V_{max}}{V_d} \\frac{d}{dC} \\left( \\frac{C}{K_m + C} \\right) $$\nUsing the quotient rule for differentiation, $\\frac{d}{dC} \\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$, with $u=C$ and $v=K_m+C$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dC} \\left( \\frac{C}{K_m + C} \\right) = \\frac{(1)(K_m + C) - (C)(1)}{(K_m + C)^2} = \\frac{K_m}{(K_m + C)^2} $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $f'(C)$:\n$$ f'(C) = - \\frac{V_{max}}{V_d} \\frac{K_m}{(K_m + C)^2} = -\\frac{V_{max} K_m}{V_d (K_m + C)^2} $$\nFor local stability, we must evaluate $f'(C)$ at $C = C_{ss}$. The parameters $V_{max}$, $K_m$, and $V_d$ are all positive constants. The steady-state concentration $C_{ss}$, when it exists as a physical value, is also non-negative. Therefore, the term $(K_m + C_{ss})^2$ is strictly positive.\nThe entire expression for $f'(C_{ss})$ is a product of positive quantities ($V_{max}$, $K_m$, $V_d$, $(K_m + C_{ss})^2$) preceded by a negative sign. Consequently:\n$$ f'(C_{ss}) = -\\frac{V_{max} K_m}{V_d (K_m + C_{ss})^2}  0 $$\nThis inequality holds for any physically meaningful steady state $C_{ss}$. This means that whenever a unique, positive steady state exists, it is also locally asymptotically stable.\n\nThe condition for existence ($R_{in}  V_{max}$) is therefore the same as the condition for having a unique and stable steady state. The parameter regime is defined by the inequality $R_{in}  V_{max}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the symbolic expression for $C_{ss}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{R_{in} K_m}{V_{max} - R_{in}}}\n$$", "id": "4966599"}, {"introduction": "In linear pharmacokinetics, drug exposure, as measured by the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), is directly proportional to the dose.

By doubling the dose, the starting concentration ($C_0 = 10 \\, \\mathrm{mg/L}$) became twice the $K_m$, pushing the elimination pathway to operate at $10/(5+10) = 67\\%$ of its capacity.

The fitted constant clearance, $CL_{\\mathrm{fit}}$, will necessarily be higher than the true clearance in this region.
