A solution will be derived from the specified first principles.\n\n### Derivation and Calculation\n\n**1) Maintenance Dose ($D_M$)**\n\nThe maintenance dose, $D_M$, is the dose given at each interval $\\tau$ to maintain the target average steady-state concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}}$. We begin with the principle of mass balance at steady state.\n\nAccording to the first principle, at steady state, the average rate of drug entry into the systemic circulation must equal the average rate of drug elimination from the body.\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{in,avg}} = \\text{Rate}_{\\text{out,avg}} $$\n\nThe average rate of drug entry, $\\text{Rate}_{\\text{in,avg}}$, is determined by the maintenance dose $D_M$, its bioavailability $F$, and the dosing interval $\\tau$. For an oral dose $D_M$ administered every $\\tau$ hours, the fraction $F$ of the dose reaches the systemic circulation. The average rate at which the drug enters the systemic circulation is therefore the total bioavailable amount per interval divided by the length of the interval.\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{in,avg}} = \\frac{F \\times D_M}{\\tau} $$\n\nThe average rate of drug elimination, $\\text{Rate}_{\\text{out,avg}}$, is related to clearance, $CL$, and the average steady-state concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}}$. According to the second principle, clearance is the proportionality constant relating the rate of elimination to the plasma concentration, $C(t)$.\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{out}}(t) = CL \\times C(t) $$\nSince clearance $CL$ is assumed to be constant, the average rate of elimination over a long period is the clearance multiplied by the average concentration during that period. At steady state, this is $C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}}$.\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{out,avg}} = CL \\times C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}} $$\n\nEquating the average rates of entry and elimination:\n$$ \\frac{F \\times D_M}{\\tau} = CL \\times C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}} $$\n\nWe can now solve for the maintenance dose, $D_M$:\n$$ D_M = \\frac{CL \\times C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}} \\times \\tau}{F} $$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n- $CL = 3.7~\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n- $C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}} = 5.0~\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n- $\\tau = 8.0~\\mathrm{h}$\n- $F = 0.55$\n\n$$ D_M = \\frac{(3.7~\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}) \\times (5.0~\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}) \\times (8.0~\\mathrm{h})}{0.55} $$\n$$ D_M = \\frac{148}{0.55}~\\mathrm{mg} \\approx 269.0909...~\\mathrm{mg} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the maintenance dose is $D_M = 269~\\mathrm{mg}$.\n\n**2) Loading Dose ($D_L$)**\n\nA loading dose, $D_L$, is a single, larger initial dose given to rapidly achieve a therapeutic amount of drug in the body, bypassing the slow accumulation that occurs with maintenance dosing. The goal is to \"fill\" the apparent volume of distribution, $V_d$, to the target concentration. The problem asks for a dose that places the body's amount of drug at the level consistent with the target concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}}$, once absorbed.\n\nAccording to the fourth principle, the apparent volume of distribution, $V_d$, relates the amount of drug in the body, $A$, to the plasma concentration, $C$.\n$$ A = V_d \\times C $$\nThe target amount of drug in the body, $A_{\\mathrm{target}}$, that corresponds to the target average steady-state concentration $C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}}$ is:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{target}} = V_d \\times C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}} $$\n\nThe loading dose, $D_L$, is the administered dose required to achieve this target amount in the body. Since the drug is given orally, we must account for its bioavailability, $F$, as per the third principle. The amount of drug that actually reaches the systemic circulation after the loading dose is $F \\times D_L$. This absorbed amount must equal the target amount in the body.\n$$ F \\times D_L = A_{\\mathrm{target}} $$\n\nCombining the two equations:\n$$ F \\times D_L = V_d \\times C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}} $$\n\nWe can now solve for the loading dose, $D_L$:\n$$ D_L = \\frac{V_d \\times C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}}}{F} $$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n- $V_d = 140~\\mathrm{L}$\n- $C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}} = 5.0~\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n- $F = 0.55$\n\n$$ D_L = \\frac{(140~\\mathrm{L}) \\times (5.0~\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1})}{0.55} $$\n$$ D_L = \\frac{700}{0.55}~\\mathrm{mg} \\approx 1272.7272...~\\mathrm{mg} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the loading dose is $D_L = 1270~\\mathrm{mg}$, which can be expressed as $1.27 \\times 10^{3}~\\mathrm{mg}$ to show the significance unambiguously.\n\nThe final calculated values are:\n- Maintenance Dose: $269~\\mathrm{mg}$\n- Loading Dose: $1270~\\mathrm{mg}$ (or $1.27 \\times 10^{3}~\\mathrm{mg}$)", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 269 & 1.27 \\times 10^{3} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5235513"}, {"introduction": "While initial dose calculations provide an excellent starting point based on population averages, true individualization comes from monitoring a patient's unique response. This exercise simulates a core activity in TDM: adjusting a dose based on a measured drug concentration.

A system is linear if it adheres to the principle of superposition. This means that if an input stimulus is scaled by a factor, the system's response is scaled by the same factor. In this context, the administered drug dose, $D$, is the input, and the resulting plasma drug concentration over time, $C(t)$, is the response.\n\nLet the function $C_{\\text{ss}}(t; D)$ represent the drug concentration at time $t$ within a dosing interval at steady state, for a maintenance dose $D$ administered every interval $\\tau$. The problem states that the system is linear. Therefore, scaling the input dose from $D$ to a new dose $\\alpha D$ will scale the entire steady-state concentration profile by the same factor $\\alpha$:\n$$C_{\\text{ss}}(t; \\alpha D) = \\alpha \\cdot C_{\\text{ss}}(t; D)$$\nThis relationship holds for all points in time $t$ during the dosing interval, including the specific time at which the trough concentration is measured. The steady-state trough concentration, $C_{\\text{ss,min}}$, is the minimum concentration observed during the dosing interval at steady state, typically measured immediately before the administration of the next dose.\n\nGiven this direct proportionality, we can establish a relationship between two different dosing regimens (regimen $1$ and regimen $2$) where only the dose is changed, while all other pharmacokinetic parameters ($F$, $V_d$, $k_a$, $k_e$) and the dosing interval $\\tau$ remain constant.\n\nLet $D_1$ be the initial maintenance dose and $C_{\\text{ss,min,1}}$ be the measured steady-state trough concentration for this dose.\nLet $D_2$ be the new, adjusted maintenance dose and $C_{\\text{ss,min,2}}$ be the target steady-state trough concentration.\n\nBased on the principle of linearity, we can write:\n$$C_{\\text{ss,min,1}} = k \\cdot D_1$$\n$$C_{\\text{ss,min,2}} = k \\cdot D_2$$\nwhere $k$ is the constant of proportionality that depends on the patient's specific pharmacokinetic parameters and the dosing interval. Since these are assumed to be unchanged, $k$ is the same for both regimens.\n\nTo derive the form of the dose adjustment, we can take the ratio of these two equations:\n$$\\frac{C_{\\text{ss,min,2}}}{C_{\\text{ss,min,1}}} = \\frac{k \\cdot D_2}{k \\cdot D_1}$$\nThe constant of proportionality $k$ cancels, yielding the fundamental relationship for dose adjustment in linear pharmacokinetics:\n$$\\frac{C_{\\text{ss,min,2}}}{C_{\\text{ss,min,1}}} = \\frac{D_2}{D_1}$$\nThis equation formally justifies that the steady-state trough concentration is proportional to the administered dose. To find the required new dose $D_2$, we rearrange this expression:\n$$D_2 = D_1 \\cdot \\frac{C_{\\text{ss,min,2}}}{C_{\\text{ss,min,1}}}$$\nThis is the dose adjustment formula.\n\nWe are given the following values:\nThe initial maintenance dose, $D_1 = 200\\ \\mathrm{mg}$.\nThe observed steady-state trough concentration, $C_{\\text{ss,min,1}} = 5.2\\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.\nThe target steady-state trough concentration, $C_{\\text{ss,min,2}} = 6.5\\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula for $D_2$:\n$$D_2 = 200\\ \\mathrm{mg} \\cdot \\frac{6.5\\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}}{5.2\\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}}$$\nThe units of concentration cancel, leaving the result in units of mass (mg), as expected for a dose.\n$$D_2 = 200 \\cdot \\frac{6.5}{5.2}\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\n$$D_2 = 200 \\cdot 1.25\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\n$$D_2 = 250\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

When a patient's physiological state changes, such as a decline in kidney or liver function, we can anticipate the impact on drug elimination and adjust therapy accordingly.

No scientific or logical flaws are present.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first establishing the fundamental equation for the average steady-state concentration ($C_{ss,avg}$) and then using it to determine the required dose adjustment.\n\nFrom the problem statement, the average steady-state concentration is defined as the area under the concentration-time curve ($AUC$) over one dosing interval, $\\tau$, divided by that interval:\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{AUC_{ss}}{\\tau}$$\nThe problem also provides the relationship for the area under the curve at steady state for a drug with oral bioavailability $F$, dose $D$, and total body clearance $CL$:\n$$AUC_{ss} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $AUC_{ss}$ into the equation for $C_{ss,avg}$ yields the governing equation for the average steady-state concentration achieved with a maintenance dosing regimen:\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL \\cdot \\tau}$$\nThis relationship is valid for drugs exhibiting linear pharmacokinetics.\n\nLet the initial, pre-impairment state be denoted by the subscript $0$.
