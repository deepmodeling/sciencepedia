Then, infer the multiplicative adjustment factor for the IV maintenance dose rate needed to maintain the same steady-state average plasma concentration as at baseline, assuming hepatic clearance is the only route of elimination.\n\nReport your final answer as three values in the following order: new $CL_h$ (in L/min), new $E_h$ (as a decimal), and the IV maintenance dose rate adjustment factor (dimensionless). Round all reported values to four significant figures. Express all fractions and ratios as decimals (no percent signs).", "solution": "The analysis is based on the well-stirred liver model. The fundamental equations for this model are:\nThe hepatic clearance, $CL_h$, is a function of hepatic blood flow, $Q_h$, and the hepatic extraction ratio, $E_h$:\n$$CL_h = Q_h \\cdot E_h$$\nThe hepatic extraction ratio, $E_h$, is defined by the relationship between hepatic blood flow and the unbound intrinsic clearance, $CL_{int, u}$:\n$$E_h = \\frac{CL_{int, u}}{Q_h + CL_{int, u}}$$\nUnbound intrinsic clearance is the product of the total intrinsic clearance, $CL_{int}$, and the unbound fraction of the drug in plasma, $f_u$:\n$$CL_{int, u} = f_u \\cdot CL_{int}$$\nCombining these equations gives the comprehensive formula for hepatic clearance in the well-stirred model:\n$$CL_h = Q_h \\cdot \\frac{f_u \\cdot CL_{int}}{Q_h + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}} = \\frac{Q_h \\cdot f_u \\cdot CL_{int}}{Q_h + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}}$$\n\nFirst, we determine the parameters for the new clinical state.\nThe baseline parameters are:\n$Q_{h, \\text{base}} = 1.50$ L/min\n$f_{u, \\text{base}} = 0.20$\n$CL_{int, \\text{base}} = 5.00$ L/min\n\nThe new parameters are calculated as follows:\nNew hepatic blood flow, $Q_{h, \\text{new}}$:\n$$Q_{h, \\text{new}} = 0.70 \\times Q_{h, \\text{base}} = 0.70 \\times 1.50 \\text{ L/min} = 1.05 \\text{ L/min}$$\nNew unbound fraction, $f_{u, \\text{new}}$:\n$$f_{u, \\text{new}} = 1.50 \\times f_{u, \\text{base}} = 1.50 \\times 0.20 = 0.30$$\nNew intrinsic clearance, $CL_{int, \\text{new}}$:\n$$CL_{int, \\text{new}} = 0.60 \\times CL_{int, \\text{base}} = 0.60 \\times 5.00 \\text{ L/min} = 3.00 \\text{ L/min}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the new unbound intrinsic clearance, $CL_{int, u, \\text{new}}$:\n$$CL_{int, u, \\text{new}} = f_{u, \\text{new}} \\cdot CL_{int, \\text{new}} = 0.30 \\times 3.00 \\text{ L/min} = 0.90 \\text{ L/min}$$\n\nNow we can calculate the new hepatic clearance, $CL_{h, \\text{new}}$:\n$$CL_{h, \\text{new}} = \\frac{Q_{h, \\text{new}} \\cdot CL_{int, u, \\text{new}}}{Q_{h, \\text{new}} + CL_{int, u, \\text{new}}}$$\n$$CL_{h, \\text{new}} = \\frac{1.05 \\text{ L/min} \\times 0.90 \\text{ L/min}}{1.05 \\text{ L/min} + 0.90 \\text{ L/min}} = \\frac{0.945}{1.95} \\text{ L/min} \\approx 0.484615... \\text{ L/min}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the new hepatic clearance is $CL_{h, \\text{new}} = 0.4846$ L/min.\n\nNext, we calculate the new hepatic extraction ratio, $E_{h, \\text{new}}$. We can use its definition:\n$$E_{h, \\text{new}} = \\frac{CL_{int, u, \\text{new}}}{Q_{h, \\text{new}} + CL_{int, u, \\text{new}}}$$\n$$E_{h, \\text{new}} = \\frac{0.90 \\text{ L/min}}{1.05 \\text{ L/min} + 0.90 \\text{ L/min}} = \\frac{0.90}{1.95} \\approx 0.461538...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the new hepatic extraction ratio is $E_{h, \\text{new}} = 0.4615$.\n\nFinally, we determine the adjustment factor for the IV maintenance dose rate, $R_0$. At steady state, the dose rate is equal to the elimination rate:\n$$R_0 = C_{ss,avg} \\cdot CL_T$$\nwhere $C_{ss,avg}$ is the average steady-state plasma concentration and $CL_T$ is the total body clearance. Since the drug is cleared exclusively by the liver, $CL_T = CL_h$.\nThe goal is to maintain the same $C_{ss,avg}$ as at baseline.\n$$C_{ss,avg, \\text{new}} = C_{ss,avg, \\text{base}}$$\nThe relationships for the two states are:\n$$R_{0, \\text{base}} = C_{ss,avg, \\text{base}} \\cdot CL_{h, \\text{base}}$$\n$$R_{0, \\text{new}} = C_{ss,avg, \\text{new}} \\cdot CL_{h, \\text{new}}$$\nThe required adjustment factor is the ratio $\\frac{R_{0, \\text{new}}}{R_{0, \\text{base}}}$.\n$$\\text{Adjustment Factor} = \\frac{R_{0, \\text{new}}}{R_{0, \\text{base}}} = \\frac{C_{ss,avg, \\text{new}} \\cdot CL_{h, \\text{new}}}{C_{ss,avg, \\text{base}} \\cdot CL_{h, \\text{base}}}$$\nSince $C_{ss,avg, \\text{new}} = C_{ss,avg, \\text{base}}$, this simplifies to:\n$$\\text{Adjustment Factor} = \\frac{CL_{h, \\text{new}}}{CL_{h, \\text{base}}}$$\nWe need to calculate the baseline hepatic clearance, $CL_{h, \\text{base}}$. First, we find the baseline unbound intrinsic clearance, $CL_{int, u, \\text{base}}$:\n$$CL_{int, u, \\text{base}} = f_{u, \\text{base}} \\cdot CL_{int, \\text{base}} = 0.20 \\times 5.00 \\text{ L/min} = 1.00 \\text{ L/min}$$\nNow, we calculate $CL_{h, \\text{base}}$:\n$$CL_{h, \\text{base}} = \\frac{Q_{h, \\text{base}} \\cdot CL_{int, u, \\text{base}}}{Q_{h, \\text{base}} + CL_{int, u, \\text{base}}} = \\frac{1.50 \\text{ L/min} \\times 1.00 \\text{ L/min}}{1.50 \\text{ L/min} + 1.00 \\text{ L/min}} = \\frac{1.50}{2.50} \\text{ L/min} = 0.600 \\text{ L/min}$$\nThe adjustment factor is therefore:\n$$\\text{Adjustment Factor} = \\frac{0.484615... \\text{ L/min}}{0.600 \\text{ L/min}} \\approx 0.807692...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the adjustment factor is $0.8077$.\n\nThe three requested values are:\n1.
