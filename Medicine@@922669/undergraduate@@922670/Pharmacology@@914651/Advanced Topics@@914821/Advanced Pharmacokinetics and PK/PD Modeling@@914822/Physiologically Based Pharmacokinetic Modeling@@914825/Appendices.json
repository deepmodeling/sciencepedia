Consider a single, perfusion-limited liver compartment in a Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model under steady-state conditions.

The hepatic blood flow is $Q_{h}$, the unbound fraction in blood is $f_{u}$, and the intrinsic clearance (reflecting the liver’s inherent capacity to eliminate the unbound drug) is $CL_{int}$. The hepatic extraction ratio is defined as $E_{h} = \\frac{CL_{h}}{Q_{h}}$, where $CL_{h}$ is the hepatic clearance.

The rate of elimination of the drug within the liver must equal the rate at which the drug enters the liver minus the rate at which it leaves.\n\nThe rate of drug entering the liver is the product of hepatic blood flow ($Q_{h}$) and the drug concentration in the blood entering the liver ($C_{in}$):\n$$ \\text{Rate of entry} = Q_{h} C_{in} $$\n\nThe rate of drug leaving the liver is the product of hepatic blood flow and the drug concentration in the blood exiting the liver ($C_{out}$):\n$$ \\text{Rate of exit} = Q_{h} C_{out} $$\n\nThe rate of elimination ($R_{el}$) is the difference between the rate of entry and the rate of exit:\n$$ R_{el} = \\text{Rate of entry} - \\text{Rate of exit} = Q_{h} C_{in} - Q_{h} C_{out} = Q_{h} (C_{in} - C_{out}) $$\n\nHepatic clearance ($CL_{h}$) is defined as the volume of blood completely cleared of the drug per unit time. It relates the rate of elimination to the concentration of the drug entering the organ:\n$$ R_{el} = CL_{h} C_{in} $$\n\nBy equating the two expressions for the rate of elimination, we obtain a relationship for $CL_{h}$:\n$$ CL_{h} C_{in} = Q_{h} (C_{in} - C_{out}) $$\n$$ CL_{h} = Q_{h} \\frac{C_{in} - C_{out}}{C_{in}} $$\nThe term $\\frac{C_{in} - C_{out}}{C_{in}}$ is the hepatic extraction ratio, $E_{h}$. Thus, $CL_{h} = Q_{h} E_{h}$.\n\nNext, we introduce the intrinsic clearance ($CL_{int}$). The rate of elimination can also be described as a function of the liver's intrinsic metabolic capacity ($CL_{int}$) and the unbound concentration of the drug available to the metabolic enzymes. The \"well-stirred\" model assumes that the liver tissue is a single, well-mixed compartment, which implies the drug concentration within the liver sinusoids is uniform and equal to the concentration in the outflowing venous blood, $C_{out}$. Consequently, the unbound drug concentration available to the enzymes is the unbound fraction in blood ($f_{u}$) multiplied by the outflow concentration, $f_{u} C_{out}$.\n\nThe rate of elimination is therefore:\n$$ R_{el} = CL_{int} (f_{u} C_{out}) $$\n\nNow, we equate the two expressions for the rate of elimination, one based on blood flow and the other on intrinsic clearance:\n$$ Q_{h} (C_{in} - C_{out}) = CL_{int} f_{u} C_{out} $$\n\nOur goal is to find an expression for $CL_{h}$ that does not contain $C_{in}$ or $C_{out}$. We rearrange the equation to find the ratio $\\frac{C_{out}}{C_{in}}$:\n$$ Q_{h} C_{in} - Q_{h} C_{out} = CL_{int} f_{u} C_{out} $$\n$$ Q_{h} C_{in} = (Q_{h} + CL_{int} f_{u}) C_{out} $$\n$$ \\frac{C_{out}}{C_{in}} = \\frac{Q_{h}}{Q_{h} + CL_{int} f_{u}} $$\n\nWe know that $E_{h} = 1 - \\frac{C_{out}}{C_{in}}$. Substituting the expression for $\\frac{C_{out}}{C_{in}}$:\n$$ E_{h} = 1 - \\frac{Q_{h}}{Q_{h} + CL_{int} f_{u}} = \\frac{(Q_{h} + CL_{int} f_{u}) - Q_{h}}{Q_{h} + CL_{int} f_{u}} = \\frac{f_{u} CL_{int}}{Q_{h} + f_{u} CL_{int}} $$\n\nFinally, using the relationship $CL_{h} = Q_{h} E_{h}$, we arrive at the closed-form expression for hepatic clearance:\n$$ CL_{h} = Q_{h} \\left( \\frac{f_{u} CL_{int}}{Q_{h} + f_{u} CL_{int}} \\right) = \\frac{Q_{h} f_{u} CL_{int}}{Q_{h} + f_{u} CL_{int}} $$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n$Q_{h} = 1.5$ $\\mathrm{L/min}$\n$f_{u} = 0.05$\n$CL_{int} = 200$ $\\mathrm{L/min}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the product $f_{u} CL_{int}$, which represents the intrinsic clearance of the unbound drug:\n$$ f_{u} CL_{int} = 0.05 \\times 200 \\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{min}} = 10 \\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{min}} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the values into the derived formula for $CL_{h}$:\n$$ CL_{h} = \\frac{Q_{h} (f_{u} CL_{int})}{Q_{h} + f_{u} CL_{int}} = \\frac{1.5 \\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{min}} \\times 10 \\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{min}}}{1.5 \\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{min}} + 10 \\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{min}}} = \\frac{15 \\frac{\\mathrm{L}^2}{\\mathrm{min}^2}}{11.5 \\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{min}}} = \\frac{15}{11.5} \\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{min}} $$\n$$ CL_{h} = 1.304347... \\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{min}} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $CL_{h} = 1.304$ $\\mathrm{L/min}$.\n\nNext, we compute the hepatic extraction ratio, $E_{h}$, using the definition $E_{h} = \\frac{CL_{h}}{Q_{h}}$:\n$$ E_{h} = \\frac{1.304347... \\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{min}}}{1.5 \\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{min}}} = 0.869565... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $E_{h} = 0.8696$.\nAlternatively, we could use the formula for $E_{h}$ directly:\n$$ E_{h} = \\frac{f_{u} CL_{int}}{Q_{h} + f_{u} CL_{int}} = \\frac{10}{1.5 + 10} = \\frac{10}{11.5} = 0.869565... $$\n\n**Part 3: Classification and Justification**\n\nDrugs are typically classified based on their hepatic extraction ratio ($E_{h}$). A drug is considered a **high-extraction** drug if $E_{h} > 0.7$, an intermediate-extraction drug if $0.3 \\le E_{h} \\le 0.7$, and a low-extraction drug if $E_{h}  0.3$.\nSince the calculated value is $E_{h} \\approx 0.8696$, which is greater than $0.7$, the drug falls into the **high-extraction** regime.\n\nThe justification lies in the relative magnitudes of the intrinsic unbound clearance ($f_{u}CL_{int}$) and the hepatic blood flow ($Q_{h}$).\nFor this drug, $f_{u}CL_{int} = 10$ $\\mathrm{L/min}$ and $Q_{h} = 1.5$ $\\mathrm{L/min}$.\nThe condition for a high-extraction drug is that the intrinsic capacity to eliminate the drug is much greater than the rate at which the drug is delivered to the liver, i.e., $f_{u}CL_{int} \\gg Q_{h}$. This condition is met here since $10 \\gg 1.5$.\n\nIn this limit, the hepatic clearance $CL_{h}$ becomes insensitive to changes in intrinsic clearance or protein binding and is instead limited by blood flow (i.e., it is perfusion-limited). Let's examine the limit of the $CL_{h}$ formula as $f_{u}CL_{int} \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{f_{u}CL_{int} \\to \\infty} CL_{h} = \\lim_{f_{u}CL_{int} \\to \\infty} \\frac{Q_{h} f_{u} CL_{int}}{Q_{h} + f_{u} CL_{int}} = \\lim_{f_{u}CL_{int} \\to \\infty} \\frac{Q_{h}}{\\frac{Q_{h}}{f_{u}CL_{int}} + 1} = Q_{h} $$\nOur calculated value $CL_{h} \\approx 1.304$ $\\mathrm{L/min}$ is indeed close to the hepatic blood flow $Q_{h} = 1.5$ $\\mathrm{L/min}$, confirming the clearance is perfusion-limited.\nSimilarly, the extraction ratio $E_{h}$ approaches $1$:\n$$ \\lim_{f_{u}CL_{int} \\to \\infty} E_{h} = \\lim_{f_{u}CL_{int} \\to \\infty} \\frac{f_{u} CL_{int}}{Q_{h} + f_{u} CL_{int}} = \\lim_{f_{u}CL_{int} \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{\\frac{Q_{h}}{f_{u}CL_{int}} + 1} = 1 $$\nOur calculated $E_{h} \\approx 0.8696$ is high and approaches this theoretical maximum, which is characteristic of a high-extraction drug.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.304  0.8696\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4979247"}, {"introduction": "A comprehensive PBPK model must describe not only how a drug is eliminated but also how it distributes into various tissues throughout the body.
