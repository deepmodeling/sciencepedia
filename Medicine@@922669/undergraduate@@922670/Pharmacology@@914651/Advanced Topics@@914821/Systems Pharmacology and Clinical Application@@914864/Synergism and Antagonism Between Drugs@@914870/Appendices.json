This problem simulates a common scenario in preclinical research, where scientists must determine if a novel drug combination is more effective than the sum of its parts.

The response to each single agent is assumed to obey the mass-action-derived median-effect principle, which implies monotonic dose–effect relationships for each drug and defines, for any fractional effect level $x \\in (0,1)$, the single-agent dose $D_{A,x}$ (respectively $D_{B,x}$) as the dose of drug $A$ (respectively drug $B$) that yields the fraction affected $x$ when administered alone. Under the framework of Loewe additivity and mutual exclusivity (no overlapping binding sites or independent mechanisms that do not produce synergism by themselves), the Chou–Talalay Combination Index (CI) is used to quantify deviation from additivity at a specified effect level $x$, with $CI=1$ corresponding to additivity, $CI1$ indicating synergy, and $CI1$ indicating antagonism. \n\nFor a target fractional effect level $x=0.7$, the empirically determined single-agent doses to achieve $x$ are $D_{A,0.7}=4\\,\\mu \\mathrm{M}$ and $D_{B,0.7}=10\\,\\mu \\mathrm{M}$.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in quantitative pharmacology that asks for the calculation of a standard metric, the Combination Index (CI), using provided empirical data. All necessary values are given, and the underlying principles are well-established in the field of translational medicine.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the Chou–Talalay Combination Index ($CI$) for a two-drug combination therapy at a specified fractional effect level, $x$. The theoretical foundation for this index is the median-effect principle applied to dose-effect relationships. For a combination of two mutually exclusive drugs, designated here as drug $A$ and drug $B$, the $CI$ at an effect level $x$ is defined as the sum of the fractional doses. Each fractional dose is the ratio of the drug's concentration in the combination to the concentration of the single agent that would produce the same effect level $x$ on its own. The general formula is:\n$$CI_x = \\frac{(D)_A}{(D_x)_A} + \\frac{(D)_B}{(D_x)_B}$$\nIn this equation, $(D)_A$ and $(D)_B$ are the doses of drugs $A$ and $B$ used in the combination to achieve the effect $x$. The terms $(D_x)_A$ and $(D_x)_B$ represent the isoeffective doses of the single agents (i.e., the dose of drug $A$ alone or drug $B$ alone required to produce effect $x$).\n\nThe problem statement provides the following notation and values:\n- The target fractional effect level is $x = 0.7$.\n- The doses of the drugs in the combination that achieve this effect are $c_A = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $c_B = 6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n- The single-agent doses that individually achieve the same effect are $D_{A,0.7} = 4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $D_{B,0.7} = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nAdapting the general formula to the specific notation of the problem, we have:\n$$CI_{0.7} = \\frac{c_A}{D_{A,0.7}} + \\frac{c_B}{D_{B,0.7}}$$\nThis equation quantifies the nature of the drug interaction. A value of $CI_{0.7} = 1$ indicates additivity, which is the baseline assumption in the Loewe additivity model. A value of $CI_{0.7}  1$ indicates synergy, meaning the drugs are more effective together than expected. A value of $CI_{0.7}  1$ indicates antagonism, meaning the drugs interfere with each other or are less effective in combination.\n\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values into the formula:\n$$CI_{0.7} = \\frac{2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} + \\frac{6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}$$\nThe units of concentration ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) in the numerator and denominator of each term cancel out, which confirms that the $CI$ is a dimensionless quantity as required.\n$$CI_{0.7} = \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{6}{10}$$\nPerforming the arithmetic for each fraction:\n$$CI_{0.7} = 0.5 + 0.6$$\nSumming the two terms gives the final value for the Combination Index:\n$$CI_{0.7} = 1.1$$\nThe calculated Combination Index for this drug combination at the $70\\%$ effect level ($x=0.7$) is $1.1$. Since this value is greater than $1$, the interaction between drug $A$ and drug $B$ at this specific dose ratio and effect level is classified as antagonistic.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.1}$$", "id": "5008658"}, {"introduction": "The principles of drug synergy are not confined to a single therapeutic area like oncology. This practice demonstrates the versatility of the Loewe additivity model by applying it to a critical challenge in clinical microbiology: antibiotic resistance.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of pharmacology and microbiology, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its language. The problem asks for the calculation of a dimensionless index based on the principle of Loewe additivity, a standard model for assessing drug interactions. All provided data are consistent and realistic. Therefore, a formal solution can be constructed.\n\nThe problem requires the construction and calculation of a dimensionless index to quantify the interaction between two antibiotics, $A$ and $B$, based on the principle of Loewe additivity. This principle provides a framework for defining an additive interaction, against which synergy or antagonism can be measured. For an equal-effect combination, such as achieving the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), Loewe additivity posits that the sum of the fractional contributions of each drug should equal unity.\n\nThe fractional contribution of each drug is the ratio of its concentration in the effective combination to the concentration that produces the same effect when the drug is used alone. This latter concentration is, by definition, the MIC of the individual drug. Let $MIC_A$ and $MIC_B$ be the Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations of antibiotics $A$ and $B$ when used alone, respectively. Let $C_A$ and $C_B$ be the concentrations of antibiotics $A$ and $B$ in a combination that also results in the MIC effect (no visible growth).\n\nThe fractional inhibitory concentration ($FIC$) for each drug is defined as:\n$$FIC_A = \\frac{C_A}{MIC_A}$$\n$$FIC_B = \\frac{C_B}{MIC_B}$$\n\nThe dimensionless index that aggregates these contributions is the sum of the individual $FIC$ values, known as the Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index ($FICI$ or $\\sum FIC$).\n$$FICI = FIC_A + FIC_B$$\n\nSubstituting the definitions for $FIC_A$ and $FIC_B$, the formula for the index is:\n$$FICI = \\frac{C_A}{MIC_A} + \\frac{C_B}{MIC_B}$$\n\nThis index provides a quantitative measure of the drug interaction:\n- If $FICI = 1$, the interaction is termed additive. The combined effect is exactly what would be predicted by the Loewe additivity model.\n- If $FICI  1$, the interaction is synergistic. The drugs are more effective in combination than predicted, meaning a lower total fractional concentration is needed to achieve the effect. A common threshold for clinically significant synergy is $FICI \\leq 0.5$.\n- If $FICI  1$, the interaction is antagonistic. The drugs are less effective in combination, requiring a higher total fractional concentration to achieve the effect.\n\nThe problem provides the following data:\n- MIC of antibiotic $A$, $MIC_A = 8$ micrograms per milliliter.\n- MIC of antibiotic $B$, $MIC_B = 1$ microgram per milliliter.\n- Concentration of $A$ in the effective combination, $C_A = 2$ micrograms per milliliter.\n- Concentration of $B$ in the effective combination, $C_B = 0.25$ micrograms per milliliter.\n\nWe can now compute the individual $FIC$ values:\n$$FIC_A = \\frac{2 \\, \\mu\\text{g/mL}}{8 \\, \\mu\\text{g/mL}} = 0.25$$\n$$FIC_B = \\frac{0.25 \\, \\mu\\text{g/mL}}{1 \\, \\mu\\text{g/mL}} = 0.25$$\n\nThe $FICI$ is the sum of these values:\n$$FICI = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be reported to four significant figures. The exact calculated value is $0.5$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $0.5000$.
