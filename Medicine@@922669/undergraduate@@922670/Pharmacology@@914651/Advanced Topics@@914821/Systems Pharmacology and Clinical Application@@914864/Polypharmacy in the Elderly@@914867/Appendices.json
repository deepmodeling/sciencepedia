The problem directs the use of a standard, creatinine-based estimator and compares its result to a gold-standard measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR).\n\nFirst, we must estimate the patient's creatinine clearance (CrCl). The problem statement refers to \"the well-established empirical approach that uses a creatinine-based estimator for adult drug dosing in non-obese patients with normal body composition assumptions\". This uniquely identifies the Cockcroft-Gault equation, which is the standard method used for this purpose in clinical practice.

However, the patient has severe muscle wasting (sarcopenia). Creatinine is a metabolic byproduct of muscle. In a sarcopenic patient, the production of creatinine is significantly reduced, leading to an artificially low serum creatinine level for a given GFR. The Cockcroft-Gault equation does not account for this, interpreting the low SCr of $0.6$ $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ as a sign of high renal clearance, thereby overestimating the true GFR.\n\nThe problem provides the true GFR, measured directly via iohexol clearance, as:\n$$ \\text{true GFR} = 45 \\, \\mathrm{mL/min} $$\n\nNext, we formalize and compute the overdose risk ratio, $R$. The problem defines this as:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\widehat{\\text{CrCl}}}{\\text{true GFR}} $$\nThe problem states that clinical dosing practice scales the maintenance dose proportionally to the estimated renal clearance ($\\widehat{\\text{CrCl}}$). Therefore, the administered dose, $D_{\\text{admin}}$, would be proportional to $\\widehat{\\text{CrCl}}$, while the ideal dose, $D_{\\text{ideal}}$, corrected for the patient's actual renal function, should be proportional to the true GFR.\n$$ \\frac{D_{\\text{admin}}}{D_{\\text{ideal}}} = \\frac{k \\cdot \\widehat{\\text{CrCl}}}{k \\cdot \\text{true GFR}} = \\frac{\\widehat{\\text{CrCl}}}{\\text{true GFR}} = R $$\nThus, $R$ represents the factor by which the standard dosing regimen would overdose the patient.\n\nUsing the calculated and given values:\n$$ R = \\frac{61.625 \\, \\mathrm{mL/min}}{45 \\, \\mathrm{mL/min}} $$\n$$ R \\approx 1.369444... $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer for $R$ to three significant figures.\n$$ R \\approx 1.37 $$\nAn $R$ value of $1.37$ indicates that using the standard creatinine-based estimation would lead to a maintenance dose that is approximately $37\\%$ higher than what is appropriate for the patient's true renal function, significantly increasing the risk of drug toxicity and adverse events.
