A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe analysis proceeds by applying the principles of chemical kinetics and thermodynamics to the given biomolecular interaction.\n\n1.  **Determination of the Equilibrium Dissociation Constant ($K_d$)**\n    The interaction between the ligand ($L$) and the kinase target ($P$) to form the complex ($LP$) can be represented by the reversible reaction:\n    $$L + P \\underset{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{\\stackrel{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} LP$$\n    The rate of association is given by the law of mass action as $v_{\\mathrm{on}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}[L][P]$, and the rate of dissociation is $v_{\\mathrm{off}} = k_{\\mathrm{off}}[LP]$.\n    At equilibrium, the rate of association equals the rate of dissociation:\n    $$k_{\\mathrm{on}}[L][P] = k_{\\mathrm{off}}[LP]$$\n    The equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the equilibrium concentrations:\n    $$K_d = \\frac{[L][P]}{[LP]}$$\n    By rearranging the rate balance equation, we can express $K_d$ in terms of the rate constants:\n    $$K_d = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$K_d = \\frac{0.01\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}}{1 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}} = 1 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{M}$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, we get $K_d = 1.000 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{M}$.\n\n2.  **Determination of the Standard Gibbs Free Energy Change ($\\Delta G^{\\circ}$)**\n    The standard Gibbs free energy change of binding, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$, is related to the equilibrium constant of the association reaction. The equilibrium association constant, $K_a$, is the reciprocal of the dissociation constant, $K_d$:\n    $$K_a = \\frac{1}{K_d}$$\n    The fundamental thermodynamic relationship is:\n    $$\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -RT \\ln K_a$$\n    where the standard state for solutes is typically $1\\ \\mathrm{M}$. Substituting $K_a = 1/K_d$ into the equation yields:\n    $$\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{K_d}\\right) = RT \\ln K_d$$\n    For this calculation, $K_d$ must be a dimensionless quantity, which is achieved by dividing it by the standard state concentration $c^{\\circ} = 1\\ \\mathrm{M}$. The expression is formally $\\Delta G^{\\circ} = RT \\ln(K_d/c^{\\circ})$. Since $c^{\\circ}$ has a numerical value of $1$, we can proceed using the numerical value of $K_d$ expressed in molarity.\n    Substituting the known values:\n    $$R = 1.987 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$$\n    $$T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$$\n    $$K_d = 1 \\times 10^{-8}$$\n    $$\\Delta G^{\\circ} = (1.987 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (298\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\times \\ln(1 \\times 10^{-8})$$\n    $$\\Delta G^{\\circ} \\approx (0.592126\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}) \\times (-18.42068)$$\n    $$\\Delta G^{\\circ} \\approx -10.90753\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$$\n    Rounding the result to four significant figures gives $\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -10.91\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$. The negative sign indicates that the binding process is spontaneous under standard conditions.\n\n3.  **Determination of the Residence Time ($\\tau$)**\n    The residence time of the complex is the average lifetime of the bound state before it dissociates. The dissociation is a unimolecular, first-order kinetic process governed by the rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$. The concentration of the complex $[LP]$ decays over time $t$ according to the first-order rate law:\n    $$[LP](t) = [LP]_0 \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{off}} t)$$\n    The mean lifetime, or residence time $\\tau$, for a first-order decay process is the reciprocal of the rate constant:\n    $$\\tau = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}$$\n    Substituting the given value for $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$:\n    $$\\tau = \\frac{1}{0.01\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}} = 100\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\n    To express this to four significant figures, we write $\\tau = 100.0\\ \\mathrm{s}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.000 \\times 10^{-8}  -10.91  100.0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4985174"}, {"introduction": "Beyond knowing the strength of a drug's binding, it is crucial to understand the energetic forces driving the interaction.

A process is spontaneous if $\\Delta G  0$. In this case, $\\Delta G = -10\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$, so the binding is spontaneous.
