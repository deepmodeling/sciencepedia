It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical thermodynamics and molecular biology, is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, precise language. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two tasks: first, to derive an expression for the melting temperature $T_m$ of an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)–RNA duplex, and second, to calculate its numerical value for a given set of parameters.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the expression for $T_m$**\n\nWe begin with the fundamental thermodynamic relations provided. The Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G$, for the hybridization reaction is given by the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation:\n$$ \\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S $$\nwhere $\\Delta H$ is the change in enthalpy, $\\Delta S$ is the change in entropy, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nAt equilibrium, the Gibbs free energy change is also related to the equilibrium association constant, $K$, by:\n$$ \\Delta G = - R T \\ln K $$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant.\n\nBy equating these two expressions for $\\Delta G$, we obtain a relationship connecting the thermodynamic parameters to the equilibrium constant:\n$$ \\Delta H - T \\Delta S = - R T \\ln K $$\nThe melting temperature, $T_m$, is the specific temperature at which this equilibrium holds. Therefore, at $T = T_m$:\n$$ \\Delta H - T_m \\Delta S = - R T_m \\ln K $$\n\nNext, we must determine the value of the equilibrium constant $K$ at the melting temperature $T_m$. The reaction is a bimolecular association:\n$$ \\text{ASO} + \\text{RNA} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Duplex} $$\nThe equilibrium association constant $K$ is defined as:\n$$ K = \\frac{[\\text{Duplex}]}{[\\text{ASO}][\\text{RNA}]} $$\nwhere the square brackets denote molar concentrations at equilibrium.\n\nThe problem defines $T_m$ as the temperature at which one-half of the total nucleic acid strands are in the duplex state. We are given equimolar initial conditions, so let the initial concentration of the ASO be $[ASO]_0$ and the initial concentration of the RNA be $[RNA]_0$, with $[ASO]_0 = [RNA]_0$. The total initial concentration of single strands is $C_T = [ASO]_0 + [RNA]_0 = 2[ASO]_0$.\n\nAt $T = T_m$, half of the strands are in the duplex. Since each duplex contains one ASO strand and one RNA strand, the concentration of duplex formed is half the concentration of either initial species:\n$$ [\\text{Duplex}]_{T_m} = \\frac{1}{2} [ASO]_0 $$\nThe concentration of free (unhybridized) ASO at equilibrium at $T_m$ is the initial concentration minus the concentration that formed the duplex:\n$$ [\\text{ASO}]_{T_m} = [ASO]_0 - [\\text{Duplex}]_{T_m} = [ASO]_0 - \\frac{1}{2}[ASO]_0 = \\frac{1}{2}[ASO]_0 $$\nSimilarly, for the free RNA:\n$$ [\\text{RNA}]_{T_m} = [RNA]_0 - [\\text{Duplex}]_{T_m} = [RNA]_0 - \\frac{1}{2}[RNA]_0 = \\frac{1}{2}[RNA]_0 $$\n\nNow we substitute these concentrations at $T_m$ into the expression for the equilibrium constant $K$:\n$$ K = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}[ASO]_0}{(\\frac{1}{2}[ASO]_0)(\\frac{1}{2}[RNA]_0)} $$\nSince $[ASO]_0 = [RNA]_0$, this simplifies to:\n$$ K = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}[ASO]_0}{(\\frac{1}{2}[ASO]_0)^2} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}[ASO]_0} $$\nWe can express $[ASO]_0$ in terms of the total strand concentration $C_T$: since $C_T = 2[ASO]_0$, we have $[ASO]_0 = \\frac{C_T}{2}$. Substituting this into the expression for $K$:\n$$ K = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{C_T}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{C_T}{4}} $$\nThe problem defines an effective concentration $C \\equiv \\frac{C_T}{4}$. Therefore, at the melting temperature, the equilibrium constant is simply the reciprocal of this effective concentration:\n$$ K = \\frac{1}{C} $$\nNow we substitute this expression for $K$ back into our thermodynamic equation at $T=T_m$:\n$$ \\Delta H - T_m \\Delta S = - R T_m \\ln{\\left(\\frac{1}{C}\\right)} $$\nUsing the logarithmic identity $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$, the equation becomes:\n$$ \\Delta H - T_m \\Delta S = - R T_m (-\\ln C) = R T_m \\ln C $$\nTo solve for $T_m$, we rearrange the equation to group the terms containing $T_m$:\n$$ \\Delta H = T_m \\Delta S + R T_m \\ln C $$\n$$ \\Delta H = T_m (\\Delta S + R \\ln C) $$\nFinally, we isolate $T_m$ to obtain the desired expression:\n$$ T_m = \\frac{\\Delta H}{\\Delta S + R \\ln C} $$\nThis expression relates the melting temperature to the standard enthalpy and entropy changes of hybridization, the universal gas constant, and the effective strand concentration. This completes the first task.\n\n**Task 2: Calculation of $T_m$**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n$\\Delta H = -95.0$ kcal/mol\n$\\Delta S = -260.0$ cal mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$\n$C = 2.50 \\times 10^{-7}$ mol/L\n$R = 1.987$ cal mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we must ensure all units are consistent. $\\Delta S$ and $R$ are in calories, while $\\Delta H$ is in kilocalories. We convert $\\Delta H$ to calories per mole:\n$$ \\Delta H = -95.0 \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{mol}} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ cal}}{1 \\text{ kcal}} = -95000 \\frac{\\text{cal}}{\\text{mol}} $$\nThe value of $C$ is given in moles per liter (M), which is the standard unit for concentration in this context, so no conversion is needed for $C$.\n\nNext, we calculate the term $R \\ln C$:\n$$ \\ln C = \\ln(2.50 \\times 10^{-7}) \\approx -15.20186 $$\n$$ R \\ln C \\approx 1.987 \\frac{\\text{cal}}{\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{K}} \\times (-15.20186) \\approx -30.20589 \\frac{\\text{cal}}{\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{K}} $$\nNow we calculate the denominator $(\\Delta S + R \\ln C)$:\n$$ \\Delta S + R \\ln C \\approx -260.0 \\frac{\\text{cal}}{\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{K}} - 30.20589 \\frac{\\text{cal}}{\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{K}} = -290.20589 \\frac{\\text{cal}}{\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{K}} $$\nNow we can compute $T_m$ in Kelvin:\n$$ T_m = \\frac{-95000 \\frac{\\text{cal}}{\\text{mol}}}{-290.20589 \\frac{\\text{cal}}{\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{K}}} \\approx 327.353 \\text{ K} $$\nThe problem asks for the temperature in degrees Celsius ($T_C$).

We will derive each from the given principles.\n\nFirst, we analyze the potency normalization factor, $N$. The problem states that the pharmacodynamic effect, let's denote it by $\\mathcal{E}$, is proportional to the effective delivered load, $L$. This can be written as:\n$$ \\mathcal{E} \\propto L $$\nIntroducing a proportionality constant, $k$, we have:\n$$ \\mathcal{E} = kL $$\nThe effective delivered load $L$ is given by the mass balance relation $L = fD$, where $f$ is the fraction of full capsids and $D$ is the administered dose.
