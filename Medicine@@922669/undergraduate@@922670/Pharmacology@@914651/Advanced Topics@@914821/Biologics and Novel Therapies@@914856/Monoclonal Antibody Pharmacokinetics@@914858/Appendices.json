Terminal Half-Life ($t_{1/2}$)**\n\nThe terminal phase of elimination is described as a first-order process. For any first-order process, the relationship between the rate constant, here denoted $\\lambda_z$, and the half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is derived from the decay equation $C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-\\lambda_z t)$. The half-life is the time required for the concentration to decrease by half, i.e., $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} C_0$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} C_0 = C_0 \\exp(-\\lambda_z t_{1/2})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-\\lambda_z t_{1/2})\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\lambda_z t_{1/2}\n$$\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -\\lambda_z t_{1/2}\n$$\nThis gives the fundamental relationship:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\lambda_z}\n$$\nSubstituting the given value $\\lambda_z = 0.03\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.03\\,\\text{h}^{-1}} \\approx 23.104906... \\,\\text{h}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the terminal half-life is $23.10$ h.\n\n**2. Extrapolated Area Under the Curve ($\\text{AUC}_{\\text{last}-\\infty}$)**\n\nThe extrapolated area under the plasma concentration-time curve from the last quantifiable time point, $t_{\\text{last}}$, to infinity is defined by the integral:\n$$\n\\text{AUC}_{\\text{last}-\\infty} = \\int_{t_{\\text{last}}}^{\\infty} C(t) dt\n$$\nAssuming first-order elimination from $t_{\\text{last}}$ onwards, the concentration can be modeled as $C(t) = C_{\\text{last}} \\exp(-\\lambda_z (t - t_{\\text{last}}))$. Substituting this into the integral:\n$$\n\\text{AUC}_{\\text{last}-\\infty} = \\int_{t_{\\text{last}}}^{\\infty} C_{\\text{last}} \\exp(-\\lambda_z (t - t_{\\text{last}})) dt\n$$\nThe integral evaluates to:\n$$\n\\text{AUC}_{\\text{last}-\\infty} = C_{\\text{last}} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\lambda_z} \\exp(-\\lambda_z (t - t_{\\text{last}})) \\right]_{t_{\\text{last}}}^{\\infty}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{AUC}_{\\text{last}-\\infty} = C_{\\text{last}} \\left( \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\lambda_z} \\exp(-\\lambda_z (t - t_{\\text{last}}))\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\lambda_z} \\exp(-\\lambda_z (t_{\\text{last}} - t_{\\text{last}}))\\right) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{AUC}_{\\text{last}-\\infty} = C_{\\text{last}} \\left( 0 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\lambda_z} \\exp(0)\\right) \\right) = \\frac{C_{\\text{last}}}{\\lambda_z}\n$$\nUsing the given values $C_{\\text{last}} = 9.35\\,\\text{mg/L}$ and $\\lambda_z = 0.03\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$:\n$$\n\\text{AUC}_{\\text{last}-\\infty} = \\frac{9.35\\,\\text{mg/L}}{0.03\\,\\text{h}^{-1}} \\approx 311.666... \\,\\text{mg}\\cdot\\text{h/L}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the extrapolated AUC is $311.7$ mg·h/L.\n\n**3. Fraction of Total AUC from Extrapolation**\n\nThis fraction is the ratio of the extrapolated AUC to the total AUC from time $t=0$ to infinity ($\\text{AUC}_{0-\\infty}$).\n$$\n\\text{Fraction} = \\frac{\\text{AUC}_{\\text{last}-\\infty}}{\\text{AUC}_{0-\\infty}}\n$$\nThe total AUC is the sum of the AUC calculated from the data points up to $t_{\\text{last}}$ and the extrapolated AUC:\n$$\n\\text{AUC}_{0-\\infty} = \\text{AUC}_{0-t_{\\text{last}}} + \\text{AUC}_{\\text{last}-\\infty}\n$$\nFirst, we compute $\\text{AUC}_{0-t_{\\text{last}}}$ using the linear trapezoidal rule. This involves summing the areas of the trapezoids formed by consecutive data points $(t_i, C_i)$.\n$$\n\\text{AUC}_{0-t_{\\text{last}}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\frac{C_i + C_{i+1}}{2} (t_{i+1} - t_i)\n$$\nUsing the provided data:\n-   $i=1$: $\\text{AUC}_{0-2} = \\frac{85 + 82}{2}(2-0) = 167$ mg·h/L\n-   $i=2$: $\\text{AUC}_{2-8} = \\frac{82 + 70}{2}(8-2) = 456$ mg·h/L\n-   $i=3$: $\\text{AUC}_{8-24} = \\frac{70 + 40}{2}(24-8) = 880$ mg·h/L\n-   $i=4$: $\\text{AUC}_{24-48} = \\frac{40 + 19.5}{2}(48-24) = 714$ mg·h/L\n-   $i=5$: $\\text{AUC}_{48-72} = \\frac{19.5 + 9.35}{2}(72-48) = 346.2$ mg·h/L\n\nSumming these individual areas gives $\\text{AUC}_{0-72}$:\n$$\n\\text{AUC}_{0-72} = 167 + 456 + 880 + 714 + 346.2 = 2563.2\\,\\text{mg}\\cdot\\text{h/L}\n$$\nNow, we compute the total AUC, $\\text{AUC}_{0-\\infty}$:\n$$\n\\text{AUC}_{0-\\infty} = 2563.2 + 311.666... = 2874.866... \\,\\text{mg}\\cdot\\text{h/L}\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the fraction:\n$$\n\\text{Fraction} = \\frac{311.666...}{2874.866...} \\approx 0.108410...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the fraction is $0.1084$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 23.10  311.7  0.1084 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4963912"}, {"introduction": "While many drugs exhibit simple linear kinetics, monoclonal antibodies often display more complex behavior due to their specific biological interactions.

We proceed with the derivation as requested.\n\nThe solution is structured to address the three tasks in order: derivation of total clearance, analysis of its curvature, and derivation of the concentration-dependent half-life.\n\n**1. Derivation of a Total Concentration-Dependent Clearance, $CL(C)$**\n\nThe total elimination rate, $v_{\\text{total}}(C)$, is the sum of the rates from the two parallel elimination pathways: the linear, nonspecific pathway and the nonlinear, target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) pathway.\n$v_{\\text{total}}(C) = v_{\\text{lin}}(C) + v_{\\text{sat}}(C)$\n\nThe rate of the linear pathway, $v_{\\text{lin}}(C)$, is defined by the concentration-independent clearance parameter $CL_{\\text{lin}}$. Using the foundational definition of clearance as rate divided by concentration, we have:\n$CL_{\\text{lin}} = \\dfrac{v_{\\text{lin}}(C)}{C}$\nRearranging for the rate gives:\n$v_{\\text{lin}}(C) = CL_{\\text{lin}} C$\n\nThe rate of the nonlinear, saturable TMDD pathway, $v_{\\text{sat}}(C)$, is given in the Michaelis–Menten form:\n$v_{\\text{sat}}(C) = \\dfrac{V_{\\max} C}{K_{m} + C}$\nwhere $V_{\\max}$ is the maximum elimination rate and $K_{m}$ is the Michaelis constant.\n\nSumming the two rates gives the total elimination rate:\n$v_{\\text{total}}(C) = CL_{\\text{lin}} C + \\dfrac{V_{\\max} C}{K_{m} + C}$\n\nThe total concentration-dependent clearance, $CL(C)$, is then found by dividing the total elimination rate by the plasma concentration $C$. For $C > 0$:\n$CL(C) = \\dfrac{v_{\\text{total}}(C)}{C} = \\dfrac{CL_{\\text{lin}} C + \\frac{V_{\\max} C}{K_{m} + C}}{C}$\n$CL(C) = CL_{\\text{lin}} + \\dfrac{V_{\\max}}{K_{m} + C}$\n\nThis expression remains well-defined at $C=0$ by taking the limit, which corresponds to the clearance at infinitesimally low concentrations:\n$\\lim_{C \\to 0^{+}} CL(C) = CL_{\\text{lin}} + \\dfrac{V_{\\max}}{K_{m}}$\nThus, the expression for $CL(C)$ is valid for all $C \\ge 0$.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Curvature of $CL(C)$**\n\nTo analyze the curvature, we compute the first and second derivatives of $CL(C)$ with respect to $C$.\n\nFirst derivative, $\\dfrac{d\\,CL}{dC}$:\nWe rewrite $CL(C)$ as $CL(C) = CL_{\\text{lin}} + V_{\\max}(K_{m} + C)^{-1}$.\nUsing the power rule and chain rule for differentiation:\n$\\dfrac{d\\,CL}{dC} = \\dfrac{d}{dC} \\left( CL_{\\text{lin}} + V_{\\max}(K_{m} + C)^{-1} \\right) = 0 + V_{\\max} \\cdot (-1)(K_{m} + C)^{-2} \\cdot (1)$\n$\\dfrac{d\\,CL}{dC} = -\\dfrac{V_{\\max}}{(K_{m} + C)^{2}}$\n\nSince $V_{\\max} > 0$ and $K_{m} > 0$ (as per the problem statement), the term $(K_{m} + C)^{2}$ is strictly positive for all $C \\ge 0$. Consequently, the first derivative $\\dfrac{d\\,CL}{dC}$ is strictly negative. This shows that the total clearance $CL(C)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of concentration $C$.\n\nSecond derivative, $\\dfrac{d^{2}\\,CL}{dC^{2}}$:\nWe differentiate the first derivative with respect to $C$:\n$\\dfrac{d^{2}\\,CL}{dC^{2}} = \\dfrac{d}{dC} \\left( -V_{\\max}(K_{m} + C)^{-2} \\right) = -V_{\\max} \\cdot (-2)(K_{m} + C)^{-3} \\cdot (1)$\n$\\dfrac{d^{2}\\,CL}{dC^{2}} = \\dfrac{2V_{\\max}}{(K_{m} + C)^{3}}$\n\nSince $V_{\\max} > 0$ and $K_{m} > 0$, the term $(K_{m} + C)^{3}$ is strictly positive for all $C \\ge 0$. Consequently, the second derivative $\\dfrac{d^{2}\\,CL}{dC^{2}}$ is strictly positive. This shows that the function $CL(C)$ is strictly convex for $C \\ge 0$.\n\n**3. Derivation of the Concentration-Dependent Half-Life, $t_{1/2}(C)$**\n\nThe problem provides the relationships for the instantaneous elimination rate constant, $k(C)$, and the concentration-dependent half-life, $t_{1/2}(C)$:\n$k(C) = \\dfrac{CL(C)}{V}$\n$t_{1/2}(C) = \\dfrac{\\ln 2}{k(C)}$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $k(C)$ into the formula for $t_{1/2}(C)$:\n$t_{1/2}(C) = \\dfrac{\\ln 2}{\\left(\\dfrac{CL(C)}{V}\\right)} = \\dfrac{V \\ln 2}{CL(C)}$\n\nNow, we substitute the previously derived expression for $CL(C)$:\n$t_{1/2}(C) = \\dfrac{V \\ln 2}{CL_{\\text{lin}} + \\dfrac{V_{\\max}}{K_{m} + C}}$\n\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we first combine the terms in the denominator into a single fraction:\n$CL_{\\text{lin}} + \\dfrac{V_{\\max}}{K_{m} + C} = \\dfrac{CL_{\\text{lin}}(K_{m} + C)}{K_{m} + C} + \\dfrac{V_{\\max}}{K_{m} + C} = \\dfrac{CL_{\\text{lin}}(K_{m} + C) + V_{\\max}}{K_{m} + C}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $t_{1/2}(C)$:\n$t_{1/2}(C) = \\dfrac{V \\ln 2}{\\left(\\dfrac{CL_{\\text{lin}}(K_{m} + C) + V_{\\max}}{K_{m} + C}\\right)}$\n\nFinally, simplifying the expression gives the closed-form for the concentration-dependent half-life:\n$t_{1/2}(C) = (V \\ln 2) \\left( \\dfrac{K_{m} + C}{CL_{\\text{lin}}(K_{m} + C) + V_{\\max}} \\right) = \\dfrac{V (\\ln 2) (K_{m} + C)}{CL_{\\text{lin}}(K_{m} + C) + V_{\\max}}$\nThis is the final simplified symbolic expression for $t_{1/2}(C)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{V (\\ln 2) (K_{m} + C)}{CL_{\\text{lin}}(K_{m} + C) + V_{\\max}}}$$", "id": "4963913"}, {"introduction": "A critical aspect of biologic therapy is managing immunogenicity—the patient's immune response to the drug itself.

All assumptions are explicitly provided and are consistent with one another.\n\nThe first step is to derive the expression for the steady-state trough concentration ($C_{\\text{ss, trough}}$) from first principles. For a one-compartment model with intravenous bolus administration, the concentration $C(t)$ at time $t$ after a single dose $\\text{Dose}_0$ is given by:\n$$C(t) = \\frac{\\text{Dose}_0}{V} \\exp(-kt)$$\nwhere $V$ is the volume of distribution and $k$ is the first-order elimination rate constant.\n\nFor a multiple-dosing regimen with a dose $\\text{Dose}_0$ administered every interval $\\tau$, the concentration accumulates.

The sum of an infinite geometric series is $\\frac{a}{1-r}$, provided $|r|  1$.

We can verify the validity of this for the pre-ADA state. Given $t_{1/2} = 28$ days and $\\tau = 7$ days, the pre-ADA elimination rate constant $k_1$ is:\n$$k_1 = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{28 \\text{ days}}$$\nThen, the product $k_1 \\tau$ is:\n$$k_1 \\tau = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{28} \\times 7 = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{4} \\approx 0.173$$\nSince $0.173 \\ll 1$, the assumption is justified. This assumption allows for the simplification of the exact expression for $C_{\\text{ss, trough}}$. For a small argument $x$, the Taylor series expansion of the exponential function is $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1 - x$. In our formula, the expression $1 - \\exp(-k\\tau)$ in the denominator can be approximated as:\n$$1 - \\exp(-k\\tau) \\approx 1 - (1 - k\\tau) = k\\tau$$\nFor the numerator, $\\exp(-k\\tau) \\approx 1$. Applying these approximations to the exact formula yields:\n$$C_{\\text{ss, trough}} \\approx \\frac{\\frac{\\text{Dose}_0}{V} \\cdot 1}{k\\tau} = \\frac{\\text{Dose}_0}{kV\\tau}$$\nUsing the relationship between clearance ($CL$), volume of distribution ($V$), and the elimination rate constant ($k = CL/V$), we can express the trough concentration in terms of $CL$:\n$$C_{\\text{ss, trough}} \\approx \\frac{\\text{Dose}_0}{(CL/V)V\\tau} = \\frac{\\text{Dose}_0}{CL \\cdot \\tau}$$\nThis derived relationship shows that, under the given approximation, the steady-state trough concentration is inversely proportional to the clearance.

Therefore, the new dose is $690.0$ mg.\n\nTo summarize, the fold change in clearance is $3$, and the new weekly dose required to restore the original trough concentration is $690.0$ mg.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3  690.0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4963940"}]}
