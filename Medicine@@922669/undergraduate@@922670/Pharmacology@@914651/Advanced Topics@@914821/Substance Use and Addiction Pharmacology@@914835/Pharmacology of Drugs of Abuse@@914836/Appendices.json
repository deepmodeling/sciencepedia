It is classically defined as the ratio of the median lethal dose to the median effective dose.\n$$ TI = \\frac{LD_{50}}{ED_{50}} $$\nA higher $TI$ value indicates a wider separation between the effective dose and the lethal dose, signifying a greater margin of safety.\n\n**Initial (Naïve) State Analysis:**\nThe problem provides the following data for a naïve population:\n- $ED_{50, naive} = 2\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n- $LD_{50} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n\nThe initial therapeutic index ($TI_{naive}$) is calculated as:\n$$ TI_{naive} = \\frac{LD_{50}}{ED_{50, naive}} = \\frac{20\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{2\\,\\mathrm{mg}} = 10 $$\n\n**Post-Tolerance State Analysis:**\nAfter sustained use, tolerance develops to the euphoric effect, but not to the lethal effect. The dose-response curve for euphoria shifts to the right, while the curve for lethality does not.\n- $ED_{50, tolerant} = 8\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n- $LD_{50} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ (remains unchanged)\n\nThe therapeutic index in the tolerant state ($TI_{tolerant}$) is calculated as:\n$$ TI_{tolerant} = \\frac{LD_{50}}{ED_{50, tolerant}} = \\frac{20\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{8\\,\\mathrm{mg}} = 2.5 $$\n\nThe development of differential tolerance has caused the therapeutic index to decrease from $10$ to $2.5$. This represents a significant narrowing of the safety margin.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The initial therapeutic index equals $10$.**\n- **Analysis:** As calculated above, using the definition $TI = LD_{50} / ED_{50}$, the initial therapeutic index is $TI_{naive} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mg} / 2\\,\\mathrm{mg} = 10$.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. After tolerance, the therapeutic index increases to $2.5$.**\n- **Analysis:** As calculated above, the post-tolerance therapeutic index is $TI_{tolerant} = 2.5$. The initial index was $10$. Since $2.5  10$, the therapeutic index has *decreased*, not increased. A decrease in $TI$ signifies a decrease in the drug's safety margin. The statement incorrectly uses the word \"increases\".\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. After tolerance, the safety margin narrows because a user must escalate dose closer to lethal levels to recapture prior effect, even if $LD_{50}$ is unchanged.**\n- **Analysis:** The safety margin is directly related to the therapeutic index. The $TI$ decreased from $10$ to $2.5$, which represents a narrowing of the safety margin. The reason provided is that the user must escalate the dose (from an $ED_{50}$ of $2\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ to $8\\,\\mathrm{mg}$) to recapture the desired effect. This new, higher effective dose is axiomatically closer to the static lethal dose ($LD_{50} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$). The proximity of the effective dose range to the lethal dose range constitutes a reduced safety margin and thus an increased risk of overdose. The statement accurately describes the underlying mechanism and consequence.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**D. If tolerance were equal for both desired and lethal effects (a parallel rightward shift of both dose–response curves), the therapeutic index would remain constant.**\n- **Analysis:** This option proposes a hypothetical scenario. Let the factor of the rightward shift be $k$. In the problem, the $ED_{50}$ shifted from $2\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ to $8\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, so $k = 8/2 = 4$. If tolerance were equal for both effects, the $LD_{50}$ would also shift by this same factor.\n- New hypothetical $ED_{50, tolerant} = k \\cdot ED_{50, naive} = 4 \\cdot 2\\,\\mathrm{mg} = 8\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n- New hypothetical $LD_{50, tolerant} = k \\cdot LD_{50, naive} = 4 \\cdot 20\\,\\mathrm{mg} = 80\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n- The new hypothetical therapeutic index would be:\n$$ TI_{hypothetical} = \\frac{80\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{8\\,\\mathrm{mg}} = 10 $$\nThis is identical to the initial $TI_{naive}$ of $10$. In general, if both numerator ($LD_{50}$) and denominator ($ED_{50}$) of the $TI$ fraction are multiplied by the same factor $k$, the ratio remains unchanged:\n$$ TI_{new} = \\frac{k \\cdot LD_{50}}{k \\cdot ED_{50}} = \\frac{LD_{50}}{ED_{50}} = TI_{old} $$\nThe statement is a correct general principle.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**E. Because $LD_{50}$ is unchanged, the overdose risk is unchanged for a user who escalates dose to re-attain euphoria.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement contains a non-sequitur. Overdose risk is a function of the proximity of the administered dose to the lethal dose. While the lethal dose ($LD_{50} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$) has not changed, the dose required to produce the desired effect has increased fourfold (from an $ED_{50}$ of $2\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ to $8\\,\\mathrm{mg}$). A user attempting to achieve euphoria is now administering a dose that is significantly closer to the lethal dose. This narrowing of the margin between the effective and lethal doses constitutes a significant *increase* in overdose risk. The premise ($LD_{50}$ is unchanged) is true, but the conclusion (overdose risk is unchanged) is false.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "4973713"}]}
