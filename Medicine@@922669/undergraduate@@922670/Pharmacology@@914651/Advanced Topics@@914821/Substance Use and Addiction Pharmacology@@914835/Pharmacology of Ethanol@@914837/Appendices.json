A full solution is warranted.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins with a mass balance on the amount of ethanol, $A$, in the body. The rate of change of the amount of ethanol is equal to the negative of its elimination rate:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = -(\\text{Rate of elimination})\n$$\nThe amount of ethanol, $A$, is related to its blood concentration, $C$, by the apparent volume of distribution, $V_{D, \\text{total}}$.\n$$\nA = C \\cdot V_{D, \\text{total}}\n$$\nDifferentiating this relationship with respect to time $t$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = V_{D, \\text{total}} \\frac{dC}{dt}\n$$\nThe rate of elimination is described by the Michaelis–Menten equation, where the rate is a function of the concentration $C$:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of elimination} = \\frac{V_{\\max} C}{K_{m} + C}\n$$\nHere, $V_{\\max}$ is the maximum rate of metabolism (mass per unit time), and $K_{m}$ is the Michaelis constant (concentration at which the rate is half of $V_{\\max}$).\n\nCombining these equations yields the differential equation for the change in ethanol concentration over time:\n$$\nV_{D, \\text{total}} \\frac{dC}{dt} = - \\frac{V_{\\max} C}{K_{m} + C}\n$$\n\n**Explanation for the Failure of the Zero-Order Assumption**\n\nThe common zero-order elimination assumption is an approximation that holds only when the ethanol concentration $C$ is much greater than the Michaelis constant $K_{m}$ ($C \\gg K_{m}$). In this high-concentration limit, the denominator of the Michaelis-Menten expression simplifies: $K_{m} + C \\approx C$. The elimination rate becomes:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of elimination} = \\frac{V_{\\max} C}{K_{m} + C} \\approx \\frac{V_{\\max} C}{C} = V_{\\max}\n$$\nThis is a constant rate, which defines zero-order kinetics. The differential equation simplifies to $\\frac{dC}{dt} = -\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V_{D, \\text{total}}}$, a constant.\n\nHowever, when the concentration $C$ is on the order of $K_{m}$ (i.e., $C \\approx K_{m}$), the term $K_{m}$ in the denominator is not negligible compared to $C$. The elimination rate, $\\frac{V_{\\max} C}{K_{m} + C}$, is now strongly dependent on the concentration $C$. For instance, at $C = K_{m}$, the rate is $\\frac{V_{\\max} K_{m}}{K_{m} + K_{m}} = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{2}$. As $C$ decreases further, the rate also decreases, progressively slowing down. Since the rate of elimination is not constant but a function of concentration, the zero-order approximation fails. The kinetics in this regime are described as mixed-order, transitioning towards first-order kinetics as $C$ becomes much less than $K_{m}$.\n\n**Derivation of the Elapsed Time Expression**\n\nTo find the time required for the concentration to fall from $C_{0}$ to $C_{f}$, we must solve the full Michaelis–Menten differential equation. We can separate the variables $C$ and $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{K_{m} + C}{C} dC = -\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V_{D, \\text{total}}} dt\n$$\nSimplifying the left-hand side gives:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{K_{m}}{C} + 1 \\right) dC = -\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V_{D, \\text{total}}} dt\n$$\nNext, we integrate both sides. The concentration $C$ goes from an initial value $C_{0}$ at time $t=0$ to a final value $C_{f}$ at time $T$:\n$$\n\\int_{C_{0}}^{C_{f}} \\left( \\frac{K_{m}}{C} + 1 \\right) dC = \\int_{0}^{T} -\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V_{D, \\text{total}}} dt\n$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$\n\\left[ K_{m} \\ln|C| + C \\right]_{C_{0}}^{C_{f}} = -\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V_{D, \\text{total}}} [t]_{0}^{T}\n$$\n$$\n(K_{m} \\ln C_{f} + C_{f}) - (K_{m} \\ln C_{0} + C_{0}) = -\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V_{D, \\text{total}}} T\n$$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$\nK_{m} (\\ln C_{f} - \\ln C_{0}) + (C_{f} - C_{0}) = -\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V_{D, \\text{total}}} T\n$$\n$$\nK_{m} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{f}}{C_{0}}\\right) + (C_{f} - C_{0}) = -\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V_{D, \\text{total}}} T\n$$\nSolving for the elapsed time $T$:\n$$\nT = -\\frac{V_{D, \\text{total}}}{V_{\\max}} \\left( K_{m} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{f}}{C_{0}}\\right) + (C_{f} - C_{0}) \\right)\n$$\nUsing the property $\\ln(x/y) = -\\ln(y/x)$, we obtain the final expression:\n$$\nT = \\frac{V_{D, \\text{total}}}{V_{\\max}} \\left( K_{m} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{C_{f}}\\right) + (C_{0} - C_{f}) \\right)\n$$\nThis is the corrected expression for the elapsed time under Michaelis-Menten elimination.\n\n**Calculation of the Specific Time**\n\nFirst, we calculate the total volume of distribution, $V_{D, \\text{total}}$:\nThe individual's mass is $M = 70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\nThe specific volume of distribution is $V_{d} = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{L/kg}$.\n$$\nV_{D, \\text{total}} = M \\times V_{d} = 70\\,\\mathrm{kg} \\times 0.60\\,\\mathrm{L/kg} = 42\\,\\mathrm{L}\n$$\nThe units for concentration and $K_m$ are $\\mathrm{g/dL}$.

Analysis of Chronic Ethanol Conditions**\n\nFor the chronic ethanol case, the parameters are modified:\n- $V_{\\max,\\text{ch}} = I \\cdot V_{\\max,0} = 2.5 \\cdot (0.6 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/h}) = 1.5 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/h}$\n- $[\\text{GSH}]_{i,\\text{ch}} = (1 - \\delta) \\cdot [\\text{GSH}]_0 = (1 - 0.30) \\cdot (5 \\ \\mathrm{mM}) = 0.70 \\cdot 5 \\ \\mathrm{mM} = 3.5 \\ \\mathrm{mM}$\nAll other parameters ($K_m$, $S$, $T$, $V_{\\text{liv}}$) remain unchanged.\n\nThe cumulative NAPQI formed under chronic ethanol conditions, $N_{NAPQI,\\text{ch}}$, is:\n$$ N_{NAPQI,\\text{ch}} = \\left( V_{\\max,\\text{ch}} \\frac{S}{K_m + S} \\right) T = \\left( (1.5 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/h}) \\frac{150 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu M}}{200 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu M} + 150 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu M}} \\right) (4 \\ \\mathrm{h}) $$\n$$ N_{NAPQI,\\text{ch}} = (1.5 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/h}) \\left( \\frac{150}{350} \\right) (4 \\ \\mathrm{h}) = (1.5) \\left( \\frac{3}{7} \\right) (4) \\ \\mathrm{mmol} = \\frac{18}{7} \\ \\mathrm{mmol} \\approx 2.5714 \\ \\mathrm{mmol} $$\nThe initial GSH pool under chronic ethanol conditions, $N_{GSH,i,\\text{ch}}$, is:\n$$ N_{GSH,i,\\text{ch}} = [\\text{GSH}]_{i,\\text{ch}} \\cdot V_{\\text{liv}} = (3.5 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}) \\cdot (1.5 \\ \\mathrm{L}) = 5.25 \\ \\mathrm{mmol} $$\nThe risk index for the chronic ethanol case is:\n$$ R_{\\text{ch}} = \\frac{N_{NAPQI,\\text{ch}}}{N_{GSH,i,\\text{ch}}} = \\frac{18/7 \\ \\mathrm{mmol}}{5.25 \\ \\mathrm{mmol}} = \\frac{18}{7 \\cdot 5.25} = \\frac{18}{36.75} $$\n\n**5. Calculation of Fold-Increase F**\n\nThe fold-increase $F$ is the ratio of the two risk indices. It is most instructive to first derive the symbolic expression for $F$.\n$$ R_{0} = \\frac{\\left( V_{\\max,0} \\frac{S}{K_m + S} \\right) T}{[\\text{GSH}]_0 V_{\\text{liv}}} $$\n$$ R_{\\text{ch}} = \\frac{\\left( (I \\cdot V_{\\max,0}) \\frac{S}{K_m + S} \\right) T}{(1 - \\delta) [\\text{GSH}]_0 V_{\\text{liv}}} $$\nNow, we compute the ratio $F = R_{\\text{ch}}/R_{0}$:\n$$ F = \\frac{\\frac{\\left( I \\cdot V_{\\max,0} \\frac{S}{K_m + S} \\right) T}{(1 - \\delta) [\\text{GSH}]_0 V_{\\text{liv}}}}{\\frac{\\left( V_{\\max,0} \\frac{S}{K_m + S} \\right) T}{[\\text{GSH}]_0 V_{\\text{liv}}}} $$\nThe common terms $\\left(V_{\\max,0} \\frac{S}{K_m + S}\\right)T$ and $[\\text{GSH}]_0 V_{\\text{liv}}$ cancel out, leaving a remarkably simple result that depends only on the induction and depletion factors:\n$$ F = \\frac{I}{1 - \\delta} $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n- $I = 2.5$\n- $\\delta = 0.30$\n$$ F = \\frac{2.5}{1 - 0.30} = \\frac{2.5}{0.7} = \\frac{25}{7} $$\nPerforming the division:\n$$ F \\approx 3.571428... $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the fold-increase is $3.57$. This indicates that the hepatotoxic risk is over $3.5$ times higher under chronic ethanol exposure for the given conditions, stemming from both increased production of the toxic metabolite and decreased availability of the detoxifying agent.\n\nThe requested intermediate values are:\n- Control: Cumulative NAPQI $\\approx 1.03 \\ \\mathrm{mmol}$, Initial GSH pool $= 7.5 \\ \\mathrm{mmol}$.\n- Chronic Ethanol: Cumulative NAPQI $\\approx 2.57 \\ \\mathrm{mmol}$, Initial GSH pool $= 5.25 \\ \\mathrm{mmol}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.57}$$", "id": "4974112"}]}
