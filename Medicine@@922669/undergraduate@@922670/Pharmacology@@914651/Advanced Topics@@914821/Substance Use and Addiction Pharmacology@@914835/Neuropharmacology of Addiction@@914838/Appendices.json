The concentration of free receptors $[R]$ is given by $[R] = [R]_{tot} - [B]$. The rate equation for $[B]$ is:\n$$ \\frac{d[B]}{dt} = k_{on}[L][R] - k_{off}[B] = k_{on}[L]([R]_{tot} - [B]) - k_{off}[B] $$\nTo express this in terms of fractional occupancy, $\\theta(t) = [B](t)/[R]_{tot}$, we divide the entire equation by $[R]_{tot}$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = k_{on}[L](1 - \\theta) - k_{off}\\theta $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We rearrange it to the standard form:\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + (k_{on}[L] + k_{off})\\theta = k_{on}[L] $$\nLet's define the observed rate constant $k_{obs} = k_{on}[L] + k_{off}$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + k_{obs}\\theta = k_{on}[L] $$\nThe solution to this differential equation with the initial condition $\\theta(0) = 0$ is a standard result from chemical kinetics:\n$$ \\theta(t) = \\frac{k_{on}[L]}{k_{on}[L] + k_{off}} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-(k_{on}[L] + k_{off})t\\right)\\right) $$\nThe term preceding the parenthesis is the equilibrium fractional occupancy, $\\theta_{eq}$. Using the definition $K_{D} = k_{off}/k_{on}$, this can be written as:\n$$ \\theta_{eq} = \\frac{k_{on}[L]}{k_{on}[L] + k_{off}} = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + k_{off}/k_{on}} = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_D} $$\nThus, the time-dependent fractional occupancy is given by the formula:\n$$ \\theta(t) = \\theta_{eq} \\left(1 - \\exp(-k_{obs}t)\\right) = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_D} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-(k_{on}[L] + k_{off})t\\right)\\right) $$\n\n**Calculation for Fentanyl (F)**\nWe apply the derived formula using the parameters for fentanyl at $t = 60 \\ \\text{s}$.\nFirst, we compute the equilibrium occupancy $\\theta_{eq}^{(F)}$:\n$$ \\theta_{eq}^{(F)} = \\frac{[L]^{(F)}}{[L]^{(F)} + K_{D}^{(F)}} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\text{M}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\text{M} + 1.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\text{M}} = \\frac{50 \\times 10^{-9}}{50 \\times 10^{-9} + 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}} = \\frac{50}{51} $$\nNext, we compute the observed rate constant $k_{obs}^{(F)}$:\n$$ k_{obs}^{(F)} = k_{on}^{(F)}[L]^{(F)} + k_{off}^{(F)} = (1.0 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1})(5.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\text{M}) + 1.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\text{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ k_{obs}^{(F)} = 0.5 \\ \\text{s}^{-1} + 0.01 \\ \\text{s}^{-1} = 0.51 \\ \\text{s}^{-1} $$\nNow, we calculate the fractional occupancy at $t = 60 \\ \\text{s}$:\n$$ \\theta^{(F)}(60) = \\theta_{eq}^{(F)} \\left(1 - \\exp(-k_{obs}^{(F)} \\times 60)\\right) = \\frac{50}{51} \\left(1 - \\exp(-0.51 \\times 60)\\right) = \\frac{50}{51} \\left(1 - \\exp(-30.6)\\right) $$\nThe term $\\exp(-30.6)$ is exceedingly small, thus the factor $(1 - \\exp(-30.6))$ is nearly equal to $1$.

This \"fast-on, slow-off\" profile leads to rapid receptor accumulation and prolonged activation, quickly driving receptor occupancy to near-saturation ($\\theta_{eq}^{(F)} \\approx 98\\%$). This persistent high-level signaling strongly contributes to profound respiratory depression, increasing overdose risk. It is also difficult to reverse with antagonists like naloxone.\n-   **Heroin's metabolites** have a high association rate ($k_{on}^{(H)} = 5.0 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}$) but also a much higher dissociation rate ($k_{off}^{(H)} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-1} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$) than fentanyl. The resulting short residence time of $1/k_{off} = 2 \\ \\text{s}$ creates a more dynamic equilibrium.\n-   **Tolerance Development**: The prolonged, high-intensity receptor stimulation caused by fentanyl's slow dissociation is a powerful stimulus for receptor desensitization and downregulation, the cellular mechanisms underlying tolerance. A \"slow-off\" drug drives a more rapid and profound development of tolerance than a \"fast-off\" drug. The calculations show that fentanyl achieves and maintains a higher level of MOR occupancy than heroin at the given concentrations, which is consistent with its greater potential for inducing tolerance and its higher overdose risk.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.471}\n$$", "id": "4965829"}, {"introduction": "A cornerstone of treating opioid use disorder is the use of medications that compete with illicit opioids at the receptor level.

Provide your final answer as a row vector $\\left(C_{\\text{plasma,ss}},\\, C_{\\text{brain,ss}},\\, S\\right)$.", "solution": "The steady-state plasma concentration, $C_{\\text{plasma,ss}}$, is reached when the rate of drug administration equals the rate of drug elimination. With a constant zero-order input rate $R$ and complete bioavailability ($F=1$), the administration rate is $R$. The elimination rate is the product of systemic clearance ($CL$) and the plasma concentration.\n\nAt steady state:\n$$ R = CL \\times C_{\\text{plasma,ss}} $$\nSolving for $C_{\\text{plasma,ss}}$:\n$$ C_{\\text{plasma,ss}} = \\frac{R}{CL} = \\frac{0.875 \\text{ mg/h}}{60 \\text{ L/h}} = 0.0145833... \\text{ mg/L} $$\nTo convert this to ng/mL, we use the conversions $1 \\text{ mg} = 10^6 \\text{ ng}$ and $1 \\text{ L} = 10^3 \\text{ mL}$:\n$$ C_{\\text{plasma,ss}} = 0.0145833... \\text{ mg/L} \\times 1000 \\frac{\\text{ng/mL}}{\\text{mg/L}} = 14.5833... \\text{ ng/mL} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, $C_{\\text{plasma,ss}} = 14.6 \\text{ ng/mL}$.\n\nThe steady-state brain concentration, $C_{\\text{brain,ss}}$, is determined by the blood-brain partition coefficient, $K_p$, which is the ratio of brain to plasma concentration at equilibrium:\n$$ K_p = \\frac{C_{\\text{brain,ss}}}{C_{\\text{plasma,ss}}} $$\nTherefore:\n$$ C_{\\text{brain,ss}} = K_p \\times C_{\\text{plasma,ss}} = 2.0 \\times 14.5833... \\text{ ng/mL} = 29.1666... \\text{ ng/mL} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, $C_{\\text{brain,ss}} = 29.2 \\text{ ng/mL}$.\n\nFinally, the suppression index, $S$, is the ratio of the steady-state brain concentration to the minimal effective concentration, $C^{\\ast}$:\n$$ S = \\frac{C_{\\text{brain,ss}}}{C^{\\ast}} = \\frac{29.1666... \\text{ ng/mL}}{20 \\text{ ng/mL}} = 1.45833... $$\nRounding to three significant figures, $S = 1.46$.\n\nThe final answer as a row vector is $\\left(C_{\\text{plasma,ss}},\\, C_{\\text{brain,ss}},\\, S\\right)$ with the computed values.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n14.6 & 29.2 & 1.46\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4965892"}]}
