Let the frequency of the loss-of-function allele $L$ in the population's gene pool be $p$, and the frequency of the functional allele $F$ be $q$. Since these are the only two alleles for this gene, their frequencies must sum to unity:\n$$p + q = 1$$\n\nUnder Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of the three possible genotypes ($LL$, $LF$, and $FF$) in the next generation are predicted by the terms of the binomial expansion of $(p+q)^2$:\n$$(p+q)^2 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$$\n\nWhere:\n-   The frequency of the homozygous genotype $LL$ is $p^2$.\n-   The frequency of the heterozygous genotype $LF$ is $2pq$.\n-   The frequency of the homozygous genotype $FF$ is $q^2$.\n\nThe problem defines the clinical phenotype of \"poor metabolizers\" as corresponding exclusively to the homozygous recessive genotype, $LL$. Therefore, the proportion of poor metabolizers in the population is identical to the frequency of the $LL$ genotype.\n\nProportion of poor metabolizers = Frequency($LL$)\n\nFrom the Hardy–Weinberg equation, we have:\nFrequency($LL$) = $p^2$\n\nThis is the expression for the proportion of poor metabolizers in terms of $p$ alone, as requested by the first part of the problem.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires us to evaluate this proportion for a specific allele frequency, $p=0.2$. We substitute this value into our derived expression:\nProportion of poor metabolizers = $(0.2)^2$\n\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$(0.2)^2 = 0.04$$\n\nThis result is an exact decimal, as required. Thus, when the frequency of the loss-of-function allele $L$ is $0.2$, the proportion of poor metabolizers in the population is $0.04$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.04}\n$$", "id": "4952634"}, {"introduction": "To apply pharmacogenomics in clinical practice, a patient's genotype must be translated into a functional phenotype.

Gene dosage: if an allele with functional value $f$ is duplicated to $N$ copies, its contribution becomes $N \\times f$.\n3.

The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem states that we should start from the steady-state mass balance for maintenance dosing. At steady state, the rate of drug administration into the systemic circulation is equal to the rate of drug elimination from the body.\n\nThe rate of drug administration is given by the product of the oral bioavailability, $F$, and the dosing rate. The dosing rate is the maintenance dose, $D$, administered over a dosing interval, $\\tau$. Let's denote the dosing rate as $R = D/\\tau$. Therefore, the rate at which the drug enters systemic circulation is $F \\cdot R$.\n\nThe rate of drug elimination from the body is given by the product of the total systemic clearance, $CL$, and the average steady-state plasma concentration, $\\bar{C}_{ss}$. The rate of elimination is $CL \\cdot \\bar{C}_{ss}$.\n\nAt steady state, we have:\n$$F \\cdot R = CL \\cdot \\bar{C}_{ss}$$\n\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the average steady-state concentration, $\\bar{C}_{ss}$, which confirms the relationship mentioned in the problem statement:\n$$\\bar{C}_{ss} = \\frac{F \\cdot R}{CL}$$\n\nWe need to apply this relationship to both the wild-type (wt) and the variant (var) individuals.\n\nFor the wild-type individual (CYP2C9*1/*1):\n$$\\bar{C}_{ss, \\text{wt}} = \\frac{F_{\\text{wt}} \\cdot R_{\\text{wt}}}{CL_{\\text{wt}}}$$\nwhere $R_{\\text{wt}}$ is the maintenance dosing rate for the wild-type individual and $CL_{\\text{wt}}$ is their clearance.\n\nFor the variant individual (CYP2C9*3/*3):\n$$\\bar{C}_{ss, \\text{var}} = \\frac{F_{\\text{var}} \\cdot R_{\\text{var}}}{CL_{\\text{var}}}$$\nwhere $R_{\\text{var}}$ is the maintenance dosing rate for the variant individual and $CL_{\\text{var}}$ is their clearance.\n\nThe problem requires that the same target average steady-state concentration is maintained in both individuals to achieve the same target INR. Therefore:\n$$\\bar{C}_{ss, \\text{wt}} = \\bar{C}_{ss, \\text{var}}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\bar{C}_{ss}$:\n$$\\frac{F_{\\text{wt}} \\cdot R_{\\text{wt}}}{CL_{\\text{wt}}} = \\frac{F_{\\text{var}} \\cdot R_{\\text{var}}}{CL_{\\text{var}}}$$\n\nWe are given that the oral bioavailability is identical for both genotypes, so $F_{\\text{wt}} = F_{\\text{var}} = F$. The factor $F$ can be cancelled from both sides of the equation:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\text{wt}}}{CL_{\\text{wt}}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{var}}}{CL_{\\text{var}}}$$\n\nThis equation shows that to maintain the same $\\bar{C}_{ss}$, the dosing rate must be adjusted in direct proportion to the individual's clearance. We can express the required dosing rate for the variant individual, $R_{\\text{var}}$, in terms of the wild-type dosing rate, $R_{\\text{wt}}$:\n$$R_{\\text{var}} = R_{\\text{wt}} \\cdot \\frac{CL_{\\text{var}}}{CL_{\\text{wt}}}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the dose reduction fraction. This is the difference between the wild-type dose and the variant dose, expressed as a fraction of the wild-type dose. Let this fraction be $\\delta$. Since dosing rate $R$ is proportional to dose $D$ (for a fixed $\\tau$), we can use dosing rates to calculate this fraction.\n$$\\delta = \\frac{R_{\\text{wt}} - R_{\\text{var}}}{R_{\\text{wt}}}$$\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n$$\\delta = 1 - \\frac{R_{\\text{var}}}{R_{\\text{wt}}}$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $R_{\\text{var}} / R_{\\text{wt}}$ derived from the clearance relationship:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\text{var}}}{R_{\\text{wt}}} = \\frac{CL_{\\text{var}}}{CL_{\\text{wt}}}$$\nwe get:\n$$\\delta = 1 - \\frac{CL_{\\text{var}}}{CL_{\\text{wt}}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values for the clearances:\n$CL_{\\text{wt}} = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}$\n$CL_{\\text{var}} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}$\n\n$$\\delta = 1 - \\frac{0.05\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}}{0.25\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}}$$\nThe units cancel, yielding a dimensionless fraction:\n$$\\delta = 1 - \\frac{0.05}{0.25}$$\n$$\\delta = 1 - 0.2$$\n$$\\delta = 0.8$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $0.8$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $0.8000$.\nThis result indicates that an $80\\%$ dose reduction is required for an individual homozygous for the CYP2C9*3 allele compared to a wild-type individual to achieve the same therapeutic effect, a conclusion well-supported by clinical pharmacogenomic guidelines for warfarin. The bioavailability, $F=0.95$, although provided, is not necessary for the calculation of the fractional reduction, as it is the same for both genotypes and cancels out.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8000}$$", "id": "4952610"}]}
