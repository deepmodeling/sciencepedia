This algorithm will then be used to calculate a specific new dose.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the relationship between target occupancy, drug concentration, and the dissociation constant. The binding of a small-molecule inhibitor (drug, $L$) to its receptor target ($R$) is described by the reversible reaction:\n$$ R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL $$\nwhere $RL$ is the drug-receptor complex. According to the law of mass action, the dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined as:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]} $$\nwhere $[R]$, $[L]$, and $[RL]$ are the molar concentrations of the free receptor, free drug, and the complex at equilibrium, respectively. The unbound drug concentration at the target site is given as $C_u$, so $[L] = C_u$.\n\nThe total concentration of the receptor, $[R]_T$, is the sum of the free and bound receptor concentrations:\n$$ [R]_T = [R] + [RL] $$\nThe fraction of occupied target sites, $f$, is the ratio of the concentration of the bound receptor to the total receptor concentration:\n$$ f = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_T} $$\nWe can express $f$ in terms of $C_u$ and $K_d$. From the definition of $[R]_T$, we have $[R] = [R]_T - [RL]$. Substituting this into the expression for $K_d$:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{([R]_T - [RL])C_u}{[RL]} $$\nRearranging this equation to solve for the fractional occupancy $f$:\n$$ K_d [RL] = ([R]_T - [RL])C_u = [R]_T C_u - [RL] C_u $$\n$$ [RL](K_d + C_u) = [R]_T C_u $$\n$$ f = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_T} = \\frac{C_u}{K_d + C_u} $$\nThis is the Hill-Langmuir equation, which represents the fundamental relationship for this problem.\n\nThe pharmacodynamic objective is to maintain a constant fractional occupancy, $f = f^{\\ast}$, for all genotypes. To construct the dose-adjustment algorithm, we analyze this condition. If $f$ is constant, then the expression $\\frac{C_u}{K_d + C_u}$ must be constant. Let's solve this for $C_u$:\n$$ f^{\\ast} (K_d + C_u) = C_u $$\n$$ f^{\\ast} K_d + f^{\\ast} C_u = C_u $$\n$$ f^{\\ast} K_d = C_u (1 - f^{\\ast}) $$\n$$ C_u = K_d \\left( \\frac{f^{\\ast}}{1 - f^{\\ast}} \\right) $$\nSince $f^{\\ast}$ is a constant, the term in the parenthesis, $\\frac{f^{\\ast}}{1 - f^{\\ast}}$, is also a constant. This implies that to maintain constant target occupancy, the unbound drug concentration $C_u$ must be directly proportional to the dissociation constant $K_d$.\n\nLet's apply this finding to the two genotypes, A (reference) and B (variant). To maintain $f^{\\ast}$, the following must hold:\n$$ \\frac{C_{u,A}}{K_{d,A}} = \\frac{f^{\\ast}}{1 - f^{\\ast}} $$\n$$ \\frac{C_{u,B}}{K_{d,B}} = \\frac{f^{\\ast}}{1 - f^{\\ast}} $$\nTherefore, the condition for maintaining constant occupancy across genotypes is:\n$$ \\frac{C_{u,A}}{K_{d,A}} = \\frac{C_{u,B}}{K_{d,B}} $$\n\nThe problem states that the pharmacokinetics are linear, such that the steady-state unbound drug concentration $C_u$ is proportional to the dose $D$ via a constant $k$:\n$$ C_u = k D $$\nThe constant of proportionality $k$ is specified to be independent of genotype. Substituting this relationship into our condition:\n$$ \\frac{k D_A}{K_{d,A}} = \\frac{k D_B}{K_{d,B}} $$\nSince $k$ is a non-zero constant, it can be cancelled from both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\frac{D_A}{K_{d,A}} = \\frac{D_B}{K_{d,B}} $$\n\nThis equation represents the algorithm for dose adjustment.

A weaker binding affinity (higher $K_d$) requires a proportionally higher dose to achieve the same level of target engagement.\n\nNow, we apply this algorithm using the provided data:\n-   Dose for genotype A, $D_A = 95$ mg.\n-   Dissociation constant for genotype A, $K_{d,A} = 4.0$ nM.\n-   Dissociation constant for genotype B, $K_{d,B} = 9.2$ nM.\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived formula for $D_B$:\n$$ D_B = 95 \\, \\text{mg} \\times \\left( \\frac{9.2 \\, \\text{nM}}{4.0 \\, \\text{nM}} \\right) $$\nThe units of nM cancel out, as expected.\n$$ D_B = 95 \\times \\frac{9.2}{4.0} $$\n$$ D_B = 95 \\times 2.3 $$\n$$ D_B = 218.5 \\, \\text{mg} $$\n\nThe problem requests the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
