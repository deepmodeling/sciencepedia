This is a fundamental and widely accepted model in pharmacology and toxicology for describing the disposition of many substances in the body.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and all necessary conditions and data are provided. The solution process may proceed.\n\nThe fundamental principle of first-order elimination kinetics is that the rate of change of the concentration of a substance, $C(t)$, is directly proportional to the concentration itself at that time $t$. This is expressed by the linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -k_e C(t)\n$$\nwhere $k_e$ is the first-order elimination rate constant, a positive value. The negative sign indicates that the concentration decreases over time.\n\nTo find the concentration-time relationship, $C(t)$, we must solve this differential equation. It is a separable equation. We separate the variables $C$ and $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{C} = -k_e dt\n$$\nNext, we integrate both sides. We integrate from the initial time $t'=0$ to a general time $t$, and correspondingly from the initial concentration $C(0)$ to the concentration at time $t$, $C(t)$.\n$$\n\\int_{C(0)}^{C(t)} \\frac{1}{C'} dC' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k_e dt'\n$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\n[\\ln|C'|]_{C(0)}^{C(t)} = [-k_e t']_{0}^{t}\n$$\nSince concentration $C(t)$ is always non-negative, we can omit the absolute value.\n$$\n\\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C(0)) = -k_e t\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, we get:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C(0)}\\right) = -k_e t\n$$\nTo solve for $C(t)$, we exponentiate both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C(0)}\\right)\\right) = \\exp(-k_e t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{C(t)}{C(0)} = \\exp(-k_e t)\n$$\nThis gives the derived concentration-time relationship for a first-order elimination process:\n$$\nC(t) = C(0) \\exp(-k_e t)\n$$\nThe problem provides the half-life, $t_{1/2}$, not the elimination rate constant, $k_e$. The half-life is defined as the time required for the concentration to decrease to half of its initial value. At $t = t_{1/2}$, we have $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} C(0)$. Substituting this definition into our derived equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} C(0) = C(0) \\exp(-k_e t_{1/2})\n$$\nDividing by $C(0)$ (which is non-zero):\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k_e t_{1/2})\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k_e t_{1/2}\n$$\nUsing the property $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$:\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -k_e t_{1/2}\n$$\nSolving for the elimination rate constant $k_e$:\n$$\nk_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\n$$\nNow we can express the concentration-time equation entirely in terms of the given parameters:\n$$\nC(t) = C(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} t\\right)\n$$\nThe problem requires finding the time $t$ at which the concentration $C(t)$ reaches the safety threshold of $5$ micrograms per liter. Let this final concentration be $C_f = 5$ micrograms per liter. The initial concentration is $C(0) = 12$ micrograms per liter. We set $C(t) = C_f$ and solve for $t$:\n$$\nC_f = C(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} t\\right)\n$$\nTo solve for $t$, we first isolate the exponential term:\n$$\n\\frac{C_f}{C(0)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} t\\right)\n$$\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{C_f}{C(0)}\\right) = -\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} t\n$$\nFinally, we solve for $t$:\n$$\nt = -\\frac{t_{1/2}}{\\ln(2)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_f}{C(0)}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the logarithmic property $-\\ln(x/y) = \\ln(y/x)$, we can write the expression in a more convenient form:\n$$\nt = \\frac{t_{1/2}}{\\ln(2)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C(0)}{C_f}\\right)\n$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values: $t_{1/2} = 55$ days, $C(0) = 12$ micrograms per liter, and $C_f = 5$ micrograms per liter.\n$$\nt = \\frac{55}{\\ln(2)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{12}{5}\\right) \\text{ days}\n$$\nThe ratio $\\frac{12}{5}$ simplifies to $2.4$.\n$$\nt = \\frac{55}{\\ln(2)} \\ln(2.4) \\text{ days}\n$$\nWe compute the numerical value:\n$$\nt \\approx \\frac{55}{0.693147} \\times 0.875469 \\approx 79.3495 \\times 0.875469 \\approx 69.4694 \\text{ days}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $69.5$ days.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{69.5}$$", "id": "4954922"}, {"introduction": "While the one-compartment model is a useful starting point, the toxicology of many heavy metals like lead is more complex due to their long-term storage in tissues such as bone.
