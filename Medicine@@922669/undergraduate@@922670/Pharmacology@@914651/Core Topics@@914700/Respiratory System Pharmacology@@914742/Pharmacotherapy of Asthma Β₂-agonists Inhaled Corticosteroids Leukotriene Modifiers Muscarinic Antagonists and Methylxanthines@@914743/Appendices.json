Acetylcholine (agonist) evokes bronchoconstriction via muscarinic type $3$ receptors. Ipratropium (antagonist), a short-acting muscarinic antagonist used in asthma, is applied at fixed bath concentrations. Assume the following well-tested foundational facts: receptor binding at equilibrium follows the law of mass action, competitive antagonists bind reversibly to the same receptor site as the agonist, and for a purely competitive antagonist the maximal agonist effect is unchanged while the agonist concentration–response curve is shifted rightward.\n\nIn this preparation, the acetylcholine half-maximal effective concentration (median effective concentration) in the absence of antagonist is measured as $2.00\\,\\mu\\text{M}$. In the presence of three fixed bath concentrations of ipratropium, the following median effective concentrations for acetylcholine are obtained:\n- At $0.50\\,\\text{nM}$ ipratropium, the acetylcholine median effective concentration is $2.50\\,\\mu\\text{M}$.\n- At $2.00\\,\\text{nM}$ ipratropium, the acetylcholine median effective concentration is $4.00\\,\\mu\\text{M}$.\n- At $8.00\\,\\text{nM}$ ipratropium, the acetylcholine median effective concentration is $10.0\\,\\mu\\text{M}$.\n\nAll three antagonist conditions show the same maximal effect as control.

It describes a classic pharmacological experiment for characterizing a competitive antagonist, using established principles and standard methodology. All provided data are necessary and sufficient for a solution.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the application of the Gaddum-Schild equation, which describes the relationship between the concentration of a competitive antagonist and the degree of rightward shift it causes in the agonist's concentration-response curve.\n\nLet $[A]$ represent the concentration of the agonist, acetylcholine, and $[I]$ represent the concentration of the antagonist, ipratropium. The median effective concentration, $EC_{50}$, is the concentration of agonist required to produce $50\\%$ of the maximal response. The problem provides the control $EC_{50}$ for acetylcholine in the absence of ipratropium as $EC_{50, \\text{control}} = 2.00\\,\\mu\\text{M}$. In the presence of a fixed concentration of antagonist $[I]$, a new, higher agonist concentration, which we denote as $EC'_{50}$, is required to achieve the same $50\\%$ response.\n\nThe dose ratio, $DR$, is a fundamental concept in this analysis. It is defined as the ratio of the agonist concentration required to produce a given effect in the presence of the antagonist to the concentration required for the same effect in the absence of the antagonist. In this case, we use the ratio of the median effective concentrations:\n$$\nDR = \\frac{EC'_{50}}{EC_{50, \\text{control}}}\n$$\n\nFor a simple, reversible competitive antagonist, the dose ratio is related to the antagonist concentration $[I]$ and its equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_B$, by the Gaddum-Schild equation:\n$$\nDR = 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_B}\n$$\nThe constant $K_B$ represents the concentration of antagonist at which half of the receptors would be occupied by the antagonist at equilibrium. A lower $K_B$ signifies a higher affinity of the antagonist for the receptor.\n\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for $K_B$:\n$$\nDR - 1 = \\frac{[I]}{K_B} \\implies K_B = \\frac{[I]}{DR - 1}\n$$\nWe can use the provided experimental data to calculate $K_B$ for each concentration of ipratropium. The units of $EC_{50}$ and $EC'_{50}$ are both $\\mu\\text{M}$, so they cancel when calculating the dimensionless dose ratio. The resulting units for $K_B$ will be the same as the units used for the antagonist concentration $[I]$, which is $\\text{nM}$.\n\nLet us analyze each data point.\n\n**Data Point 1:**\nAntagonist concentration: $[I_1] = 0.50\\,\\text{nM}$.\nNew median effective concentration: $EC'_{50,1} = 2.50\\,\\mu\\text{M}$.\nThe dose ratio is:\n$$\nDR_1 = \\frac{2.50\\,\\mu\\text{M}}{2.00\\,\\mu\\text{M}} = 1.25\n$$\nNow, we calculate $K_B$ using this data point:\n$$\nK_{B,1} = \\frac{[I_1]}{DR_1 - 1} = \\frac{0.50\\,\\text{nM}}{1.25 - 1} = \\frac{0.50\\,\\text{nM}}{0.25} = 2.00\\,\\text{nM}\n$$\n\n**Data Point 2:**\nAntagonist concentration: $[I_2] = 2.00\\,\\text{nM}$.\nNew median effective concentration: $EC'_{50,2} = 4.00\\,\\mu\\text{M}$.\nThe dose ratio is:\n$$\nDR_2 = \\frac{4.00\\,\\mu\\text{M}}{2.00\\,\\mu\\text{M}} = 2.00\n$$\nCalculating $K_B$:\n$$\nK_{B,2} = \\frac{[I_2]}{DR_2 - 1} = \\frac{2.00\\,\\text{nM}}{2.00 - 1} = \\frac{2.00\\,\\text{nM}}{1} = 2.00\\,\\text{nM}\n$$\nNote that for this case, $DR=2$. By definition, the antagonist concentration that produces a dose ratio of $2$ is equal to its $K_B$. The data point directly gives $K_B=2.00\\,\\text{nM}$.\n\n**Data Point 3:**\nAntagonist concentration: $[I_3] = 8.00\\,\\text{nM}$.\nNew median effective concentration: $EC'_{50,3} = 10.0\\,\\mu\\text{M}$.\nThe dose ratio is:\n$$\nDR_3 = \\frac{10.0\\,\\mu\\text{M}}{2.00\\,\\mu\\text{M}} = 5.00\n$$\nCalculating $K_B$:\n$$\nK_{B,3} = \\frac{[I_3]}{DR_3 - 1} = \\frac{8.00\\,\\text{nM}}{5.00 - 1} = \\frac{8.00\\,\\text{nM}}{4} = 2.00\\,\\text{nM}\n$$\n\nAll three experimental conditions yield an identical value for $K_B$ of $2.00\\,\\text{nM}$. This indicates that the provided data perfectly conform to the model of simple competitive antagonism. In a real experiment, one would typically use a linear regression on a Schild plot ($\\log_{10}(DR-1)$ versus $\\log_{10}[I]$) to find the best estimate of $K_B$ from noisy data. However, given the perfect consistency of these results, such a procedure is unnecessary. The slope of such a plot would be exactly $1$, confirming a simple competitive mechanism, and the x-intercept would be $\\log_{10}(K_B)$.\n\nThe consistent result from all three conditions provides a highly confident estimate for the equilibrium dissociation constant. The estimated value for $K_B$ is $2.00\\,\\text{nM}$.
