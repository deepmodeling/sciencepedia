At equilibrium, we have three species of receptor: free receptor $[R]$, receptor bound to ligand $[RL]$, and receptor bound to inhibitor $[RI]$. The total receptor concentration, $[R_T]$, is the sum of these species:\n$$[R_T] = [R] + [RL] + [RI]$$\nThe interactions are governed by the law of mass action, leading to the definitions of the equilibrium dissociation constants for the ligand ($K_d$) and the inhibitor ($K_i$):\n$$K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\n$$K_i = \\frac{[R][I]}{[RI]}$$\nFrom these definitions, we can express $[RL]$ and $[RI]$ in terms of the free receptor concentration $[R]$:\n$$[RL] = \\frac{[R][L]}{K_d}$$\n$$[RI] = \\frac{[R][I]}{K_i}$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for total receptor concentration:\n$$[R_T] = [R] + \\frac{[R][L]}{K_d} + \\frac{[R][I]}{K_i} = [R] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[L]}{K_d} + \\frac{[I]}{K_i} \\right)$$\nThe amount of bound ligand, $[RL]$, can be expressed as a function of total receptors $[R_T]$ by first expressing $[R]$ in terms of $[R_T]$:\n$$[R] = \\frac{[R_T]}{1 + \\frac{[L]}{K_d} + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}}$$\nAnd then substituting this into the expression for $[RL]$:\n$$[RL] = \\frac{1}{K_d} [L] [R] = \\frac{\\frac{[L]}{K_d} [R_T]}{1 + \\frac{[L]}{K_d} + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}}$$\nThe $IC_{50}$ is defined as the concentration of inhibitor ($[I]$) that reduces the specific binding of the labeled ligand by $50\\%$.

The calculated value $K_i = 6.667 \\, \\mathrm{nM}$ represents the antagonist's equilibrium dissociation constant at the histamine $\\mathrm{H}_1$ receptor. The $K_i$ is an intrinsic measure of the antagonist's binding affinity; a lower $K_i$ value corresponds to a higher affinity. This value is independent of the labeled ligand concentration used in the assay.\n\nThe observed $IC_{50}$ of $20 \\, \\mathrm{nM}$ is greater than the true $K_i$ of $6.667 \\, \\mathrm{nM}$ because the assay was performed with a concentration of labeled ligand ($[L] = 10 \\, \\mathrm{nM}$) that is not negligible compared to its own dissociation constant ($K_d = 5 \\, \\mathrm{nM}$). In fact, $[L]$ is twice $K_d$. The presence of the labeled ligand creates a competitive environment for the antagonist. To displace $50\\%$ of the bound labeled ligand, the antagonist must not only overcome its own dissociation tendency (quantified by $K_i$) but also successfully compete against the binding of the labeled ligand. This additional competitive burden increases the concentration of antagonist required to achieve $50\\%$ inhibition, causing the observed $IC_{50}$ to be higher than the intrinsic $K_i$. The extent of this increase is given by the factor $\\left(1 + \\frac{[L]}{K_d}\\right)$, which in this case is $\\left(1 + \\frac{10}{5}\\right) = 3$. Thus, the measured $IC_{50}$ is exactly three times the true $K_i$.
