MAC is a standard unit of potency for inhaled anesthetics.\n\nThe definition of MAC is based on the alveolar concentration of an anesthetic gas that prevents movement in $50\\%$ of subjects in response to a noxious stimulus. The effective dose of an inhaled anesthetic is determined by its partial pressure in the brain, which at steady state is in equilibrium with the partial pressure in the alveoli of the lungs.\n\nDalton's law of partial pressures states that the partial pressure of a gas, $P_i$, in a mixture of gases is equal to the product of its mole fraction, $x_i$, and the total pressure of the mixture, $P_{\\text{total}}$.\n$$P_i = x_i P_{\\text{total}}$$\nFor ideal gases, a valid assumption for anesthetic agents at clinical concentrations, the volume fraction of a gas is equal to its mole fraction. The concentrations given as percentages by volume can therefore be used in place of mole fractions after conversion to a decimal value.\n\nThe patient is at a steady state with an end-tidal sevoflurane concentration, denoted as $C_{\\text{patient}}$, of $1.2\\%$. The problem states that this end-tidal concentration accurately reflects the alveolar concentration. The volume fraction of sevoflurane in the patient's alveoli, $x_{\\text{patient}}$, is therefore $\\frac{1.2}{100} = 0.012$. The alveolar partial pressure of sevoflurane in the patient, $P_{\\text{patient}}$, is given by:\n$$P_{\\text{patient}} = x_{\\text{patient}} \\times P_{\\text{atm}}$$\nwhere $P_{\\text{atm}}$ is the sea-level barometric pressure.\n\nThe MAC of sevoflurane for a $40$-year-old is given as $C_{\\text{MAC}} = 2.0\\%$ by volume. This is the concentration that corresponds to a dose of $1$ MAC. The volume fraction corresponding to $1$ MAC, $x_{\\text{MAC}}$, is $\\frac{2.0}{100} = 0.020$. The alveolar partial pressure that corresponds to $1$ MAC, denoted as $P_{\\text{MAC}}$, is:\n$$P_{\\text{MAC}} = x_{\\text{MAC}} \\times P_{\\text{atm}}$$\n\nThe fraction of MAC the patient is receiving is the ratio of the actual alveolar partial pressure of the anesthetic to the partial pressure that constitutes $1$ MAC.\n$$\\text{Fraction of MAC} = \\frac{P_{\\text{patient}}}{P_{\\text{MAC}}}$$\nBy substituting the expressions from Dalton's law:\n$$\\text{Fraction of MAC} = \\frac{x_{\\text{patient}} \\times P_{\\text{atm}}}{x_{\\text{MAC}} \\times P_{\\text{atm}}}$$\nThe term for atmospheric pressure, $P_{\\text{atm}}$, cancels from the numerator and denominator.

The classic Meyer-Overton correlation provides an elegant answer, linking an agent's potency directly to its solubility in lipids. This practice [@problem_id:4951720] will guide you through using the oil:gas partition coefficient, a measure of lipid solubility, to predict the relative potencies and MAC values of several common anesthetics.
