It is scientifically grounded in the principles of pharmacodynamics, specifically using the Hill-Langmuir equation to model a dose-response relationship. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and a clear objective. The language is objective and the values provided ($E_{\\max}=100$, $\\theta=0.8$, $EC_{50}=0.5$, $\\gamma=3$) are plausible within the context of receptor pharmacology.\n\nThe relationship between receptor occupancy ($\\theta$) and the pharmacological effect ($E$) is described by the Hill equation. This equation models cooperative binding and a saturable response. The standard form of the Hill equation for a stimulatory effect, or in this case, the magnitude of a response like twitch reduction, is given by:\n$$E(\\theta) = E_{\\max} \\frac{\\theta^{\\gamma}}{\\theta^{\\gamma} + EC_{50}^{\\gamma}}$$\nHere, $E_{\\max}$ is the maximum possible effect, $\\gamma$ is the Hill coefficient which describes the cooperativity of the interaction, and $EC_{50}$ is the occupancy that produces $50\\%$ of the maximal effect.\n\nThe problem provides the following parameters:\n- Maximal effect, $E_{\\max} = 100$ (representing $100\\%$ twitch reduction)\n- Receptor occupancy, $\\theta = 0.8$\n- Half-effective occupancy, $EC_{50} = 0.5$\n- Hill coefficient, $\\gamma = 3$\n\nWe are tasked to compute the effect $E$, which corresponds to the single-twitch reduction percentage. Substituting the given values into the Hill equation:\n$$E = 100 \\times \\frac{0.8^3}{0.8^3 + 0.5^3}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the powers of the occupancy and the half-effective occupancy:\n$$ \\theta^{\\gamma} = 0.8^3 = 0.512 $$\n$$ EC_{50}^{\\gamma} = 0.5^3 = 0.125 $$\n\nNext, we substitute these values back into the equation for $E$:\n$$ E = 100 \\times \\frac{0.512}{0.512 + 0.125} $$\nThe sum in the denominator is:\n$$ 0.512 + 0.125 = 0.637 $$\nNow, the equation for the effect becomes:\n$$ E = 100 \\times \\frac{0.512}{0.637} $$\nCalculating the fraction gives:\n$$ \\frac{0.512}{0.637} \\approx 0.803767659 $$\nTherefore, the effect $E$ as a percentage is:\n$$ E \\approx 100 \\times 0.803767659 \\approx 80.3767659 $$\nThis means the expected single-twitch reduction is approximately $80.38\\%$.\n\nThe second part of the task is to convert this computed twitch reduction to a decimal fraction of the baseline twitch amplitude. A value of $0$ corresponds to no reduction (100% of baseline twitch amplitude) and $1$ corresponds to complete abolition of the twitch (0% of baseline twitch amplitude). The effect $E$ is already a measure of reduction, expressed as a percentage. To convert it to a decimal fraction, we divide by $100$:\n$$ \\text{Decimal Fraction} = \\frac{E}{100} \\approx \\frac{80.3767659}{100} \\approx 0.803767659 $$\nThe problem requires this decimal fraction to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures of $0.803767659$ are $8$, $0$, $3$, and $7$.

Calculation of the Expected Improvement in TOF Ratio**\n\nThe problem describes a saturable dose-response framework, which can be represented by the Michaelis-Menten or Hill-Langmuir equation. As no Hill coefficient is specified, it is assumed to be $1$. The effect, $E$, as a function of the administered dose, $D$, is given by:\n$$E(D) = \\frac{E_{\\max} \\times D}{D_{50} + D}$$\n\nIn this context, $E(D)$ represents the improvement in the TOF ratio, which we will denote as $\\Delta TOF$.

The problem requires rounding to three significant figures.\n$$\\Delta TOF \\approx 0.333$$\n\nThis value represents the expected increase in the TOF ratio from its baseline. The baseline TOF ratio of $0.40$ is contextual information but is not required for calculating the *improvement*, as the model parameters ($E_{\\max}$ and $D_{50}$) are defined specifically for the improvement itself.\n\nThe final answers are the total dose of $2.80$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ and the TOF ratio improvement of $0.333$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2.80 & 0.333 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4965534"}, {"introduction": "Patient responses to the same drug dose can vary significantly, and genetics often provides the explanation.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem describes a one-compartment model with first-order elimination kinetics. The plasma concentration of the drug, $C$, as a function of time, $t$, after a single intravenous bolus dose is given by the equation:\n$$C(t) = C_{0} \\exp(-kt)$$\nwhere $C_{0}$ is the initial plasma concentration at $t=0$ and $k$ is the first-order elimination rate constant.\n\nThe recovery time, which we will denote as $t_{\\text{rec}}$, is defined as the time when the plasma concentration falls to a specified threshold, $C_{\\text{th}}$. We can set up this condition as:\n$$C_{\\text{th}} = C(t_{\\text{rec}}) = C_{0} \\exp(-k t_{\\text{rec}})$$\n\nTo derive the expression for the recovery time, we solve this equation for $t_{\\text{rec}}$:\n$$\\frac{C_{\\text{th}}}{C_{0}} = \\exp(-k t_{\\text{rec}})$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{\\text{th}}}{C_{0}}\\right) = -k t_{\\text{rec}}$$\nRearranging the logarithmic term and solving for $t_{\\text{rec}}$ gives the general expression for the time to reach $C_{\\text{th}}$:\n$$t_{\\text{rec}} = -\\frac{1}{k} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{\\text{th}}}{C_{0}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{k} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{C_{\\text{th}}}\\right)$$\nThe problem states that the elimination rate constant $k$ is related to clearance ($CL$) and volume of distribution ($V_{d}$) by the formula $k = CL / V_{d}$. Substituting this into the expression for $t_{\\text{rec}}$:\n$$t_{\\text{rec}} = \\frac{V_{d}}{CL} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{C_{\\text{th}}}\\right)$$\nThis is the derived expression for the time to reach the threshold concentration.\n\nNow, we apply this general expression to the two cases described: the normal patient and the heterozygous variant patient. Let the subscript 'norm' denote parameters for the normal patient and 'variant' for the heterozygous patient.\n\nFor the normal patient, the recovery time is given as $t_{\\text{norm}} = 10.0$ minutes. Using our derived expression:\n$$t_{\\text{norm}} = \\frac{V_{d}}{CL_{\\text{norm}}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{C_{\\text{th}}}\\right) = 10.0 \\text{ min}$$\n\nFor the heterozygous variant patient, we are told that the BCHE enzymatic activity is $50\\%$ of normal. The problem also states that clearance, $CL$, is directly proportional to BCHE activity. Therefore, the clearance for the variant patient, $CL_{\\text{variant}}$, is $50\\%$ of the normal clearance:\n$$CL_{\\text{variant}} = 0.50 \\times CL_{\\text{norm}}$$\nThe problem specifies that $V_{d}$, $C_{0}$ (for a given dose), and $C_{\\text{th}}$ are constant and independent of genotype. The recovery time for the variant patient, $t_{\\text{variant}}$, is therefore:\n$$t_{\\text{variant}} = \\frac{V_{d}}{CL_{\\text{variant}}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{C_{\\text{th}}}\\right)$$\nWe can substitute the expression for $CL_{\\text{variant}}$ into this equation:\n$$t_{\\text{variant}} = \\frac{V_{d}}{0.50 \\times CL_{\\text{norm}}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{C_{\\text{th}}}\\right)$$\nBy rearranging the terms, we can see the relationship between $t_{\\text{variant}}$ and $t_{\\text{norm}}$:\n$$t_{\\text{variant}} = \\frac{1}{0.50} \\left( \\frac{V_{d}}{CL_{\\text{norm}}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{C_{\\text{th}}}\\right) \\right)$$\nThe expression in the parentheses is identical to the expression for $t_{\\text{norm}}$. Thus, we can write:\n$$t_{\\text{variant}} = \\frac{1}{0.50} \\times t_{\\text{norm}} = 2 \\times t_{\\text{norm}}$$\nGiven that $t_{\\text{norm}} = 10.0$ minutes, we can calculate $t_{\\text{variant}}$:\n$$t_{\\text{variant}} = 2 \\times 10.0 \\text{ min} = 20.0 \\text{ min}$$\nThe problem asks for the prolongation of recovery time, $\\Delta t$, which is defined as $\\Delta t = t_{\\text{variant}} - t_{\\text{norm}}$.\n$$\\Delta t = 20.0 \\text{ min} - 10.0 \\text{ min} = 10.0 \\text{ min}$$\nThe result is required to be rounded to three significant figures, which $10.0$ already is.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10.0}$$", "id": "4965539"}]}
