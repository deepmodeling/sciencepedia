No inference about pharmacokinetics is required.\n- **Task**: Determine the tolerance model by comparing the pharmacodynamic parameters on day $14$ relative to day $1$, based on the definitions of potency and efficacy.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is scientifically grounded. It uses the standard sigmoidal Emax model (Hill equation) to describe the concentration-effect relationship, a cornerstone of pharmacology. The concepts of tolerance, efficacy ($E_{max}$), and potency ($EC_{50}$) are fundamental and correctly applied.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides two sets of concentration-effect data, from which the pharmacodynamic parameters can be estimated. The question asks for a comparison of these parameters, which leads to a unique conclusion about the type of tolerance observed.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated objectively using quantitative data and established scientific terminology. There is no ambiguity or subjective language.\n- **Conclusion**: The problem is valid. It is a standard, well-formulated problem in quantitative pharmacology.\n\n## SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe relationship between concentration $C$ and effect $E$ is described by the sigmoidal Hill equation:\n$$E(C) = \\frac{E_{max} \\cdot C^n}{EC_{50}^n + C^n}$$\nwhere:\n- $E_{max}$ is the maximum possible effect (efficacy).\n- $EC_{50}$ is the concentration required to produce $50\\%$ of the maximum effect. It is a measure of the drug's potency (potency is inversely related to $EC_{50}$).\n- $n$ is the Hill coefficient, which describes the steepness of the concentration-effect curve.\n\nWe must estimate these parameters for both day $1$ and day $14$ to characterize the change due to tolerance.\n\n### Analysis of Day 1 Data\nThe data points are $(0.5, 20)$, $(2, 50)$, $(10, 83)$, $(50, 96)$, $(200, 99)$.\n\n1.  **Estimate $E_{max,1}$ (Efficacy)**: As the concentration $C$ increases to very high values ($50$ mg/L and $200$ mg/L), the effect $E$ approaches a plateau. The values $96$ and $99$ strongly suggest that the maximum effect, $E_{max,1}$, is approximately $100$ arbitrary units.\n\n2.  **Estimate $EC_{50,1}$ (Potency)**: The $EC_{50}$ is the concentration at which $E = 0.5 \\cdot E_{max}$. With $E_{max,1} \\approx 100$, we look for the concentration that gives an effect of $E=50$. The data explicitly provides the point $(2, 50)$. Therefore, we can directly estimate $EC_{50,1} = 2$ mg/L.\n\n3.  **Estimate Hill Coefficient $n_1$**: Let's test if a simple Michaelis-Menten model (where $n=1$) fits the data with $E_{max,1} = 100$ and $EC_{50,1} = 2$.\n    The model is $E(C) = \\frac{100 \\cdot C}{2 + C}$.\n    - For $C=0.5$: $E = \\frac{100 \\cdot 0.5}{2 + 0.5} = \\frac{50}{2.5} = 20$. (Matches data)\n    - For $C=10$: $E = \\frac{100 \\cdot 10}{2 + 10} = \\frac{1000}{12} \\approx 83.3$. (Matches data value of $83$)\n    - For $C=50$: $E = \\frac{100 \\cdot 50}{2 + 50} = \\frac{5000}{52} \\approx 96.2$. (Matches data value of $96$)\n    - For $C=200$: $E = \\frac{100 \\cdot 200}{2 + 200} = \\frac{20000}{202} \\approx 99.0$. (Matches data value of $99$)\n    The fit is excellent, confirming our parameters for Day 1: $E_{max,1} \\approx 100$, $EC_{50,1} = 2$ mg/L, and $n_1 \\approx 1$.\n\n### Analysis of Day 14 Data\nThe data points are $(0.5, 8)$, $(2, 25)$, $(10, 63)$, $(50, 89)$, $(200, 97)$.\n\n1.  **Estimate $E_{max,2}$ (Efficacy)**: As $C$ increases to $200$ mg/L, the effect is $97$. This value is very close to the maximum effect observed on day $1$. It is reasonable to conclude that the maximum effect is unchanged, so $E_{max,2} \\approx 100$ arbitrary units.\n\n2.  **Estimate $EC_{50,2}$ (Potency)**: We look for the concentration where $E = 0.5 \\cdot E_{max,2} \\approx 50$.\n    On day $14$, at $C=2$, the effect is only $25$. At $C=10$, the effect is $63$. The concentration required to produce an effect of $50$ must lie between $2$ mg/L and $10$ mg/L. This is a clear increase from the day $1$ value of $EC_{50,1} = 2$ mg/L.\n    Let's assume the Hill coefficient remains $n_2 \\approx 1$ and $E_{max,2}=100$, and calculate a more precise $EC_{50,2}$. The model is $E(C) = \\frac{100 \\cdot C}{EC_{50,2} + C}$.\n    Using the point $(10, 63)$:\n    $$63 = \\frac{100 \\cdot 10}{EC_{50,2} + 10}$$\n    $$63 \\cdot (EC_{50,2} + 10) = 1000$$\n    $$63 \\cdot EC_{50,2} + 630 = 1000$$\n    $$63 \\cdot EC_{50,2} = 370$$\n    $$EC_{50,2} \\approx 5.87 \\text{ mg/L}$$\n    Let's test this value of $EC_{50,2} \\approx 6$ mg/L against the other data points:\n    - For $C=2$: $E = \\frac{100 \\cdot 2}{6 + 2} = \\frac{200}{8} = 25$. (Matches data)\n    - For $C=50$: $E = \\frac{100 \\cdot 50}{6 + 50} = \\frac{5000}{56} \\approx 89.3$. (Matches data value of $89$)\n    The fit is again excellent, confirming the parameters for Day 14: $E_{max,2} \\approx 100$, $EC_{50,2} \\approx 6$ mg/L, and $n_2 \\approx 1$.\n\n### Comparison and Conclusion\n- **Efficacy**: $E_{max,1} \\approx 100$ and $E_{max,2} \\approx 100$. Efficacy is unchanged.\n- **Potency**: $EC_{50,1} = 2$ mg/L and $EC_{50,2} \\approx 6$ mg/L. The $EC_{50}$ has increased. An increase in $EC_{50}$ signifies a decrease in potency.\n- **Hill Coefficient**: $n_1 \\approx 1$ and $n_2 \\approx 1$. The steepness of the curve is unchanged.\n\nThe development of tolerance is characterized by an increase in $EC_{50}$ with no change in $E_{max}$. This corresponds to a rightward shift of the concentration-effect curve, meaning higher concentrations are needed to achieve the same level of effect. This is a classic pattern of pharmacodynamic tolerance, often associated with competitive antagonism at the receptor level.\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n**A. Tolerance decreases $E_{max}$ while $EC_{50}$ is unchanged.**\nOur analysis shows that $E_{max}$ is unchanged (not decreased) and $EC_{50}$ increases (is not unchanged). Both claims in this option are contrary to the data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Tolerance increases $EC_{50}$ while $E_{max}$ is unchanged.**\nOur analysis shows that $EC_{50}$ increased from approximately $2$ mg/L to $6$ mg/L, while $E_{max}$ remained constant at approximately $100$. This statement perfectly describes the observations.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Tolerance decreases the Hill coefficient $n$ while $E_{max}$ and $EC_{50}$ are unchanged.**\nOur analysis shows the Hill coefficient $n$ is unchanged (approximately $1$ in both cases), not decreased. Furthermore, $EC_{50}$ is not unchanged; it increases. This option is incorrect on multiple points.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Tolerance is purely pharmacokinetic (increased clearance), with no change in pharmacodynamics; the observed shift arises from lower concentrations at equal doses.**\nThis option describes pharmacokinetic tolerance. However, the problem provides measured concentration-effect data, $(C, E)$, and explicitly asks for an analysis of this relationship. The data shows that for a given concentration $C$ (e.g., $C=2$ mg/L), the effect $E$ is lower on day $14$ ($E=25$) than on day $1$ ($E=50$). This is, by definition, a change in pharmacodynamics (the relationship between $C$ and $E$). The premise of this option (\"no change in pharmacodynamics\") is directly falsified by the provided data. The problem setup intentionally isolates the pharmacodynamic changes from any potential pharmacokinetic changes.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4944934"}, {"introduction": "Pharmacodynamic tolerance often arises from changes at the cellular level, such as the downregulation of receptors.
