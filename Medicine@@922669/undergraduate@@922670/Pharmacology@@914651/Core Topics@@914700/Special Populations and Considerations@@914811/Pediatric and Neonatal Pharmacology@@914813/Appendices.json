The solution must be derived from first principles of diffusive transport.\n\nThe foundational principle governing steady-state passive diffusion across a membrane is Fick's first law. The steady-state flux, $J$, which is the rate of mass transfer per unit area, is given by:\n$$J = P \\cdot \\Delta C$$\nwhere $P$ is the permeability coefficient of the barrier and $\\Delta C$ is the concentration difference of the solute across the barrier.\n\nThe permeability coefficient, $P$, for a simple, homogeneous membrane like the stratum corneum (SC) is defined as:\n$$P = \\frac{K \\cdot D}{h}$$\nHere, $K$ is the partition coefficient of the solute between the SC and the vehicle, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient of the solute within the SC, and $h$ is the thickness of the SC.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $P$ into Fick's law, we obtain the flux:\n$$J = \\frac{K \\cdot D \\cdot \\Delta C}{h}$$\n\nThe problem states that the systemic absorption rate, which we can denote as $R_{abs}$, is proportional to the product of the steady-state flux $J$ and the exposed body surface area, $A_{exp}$. Assuming the exposed area is a constant fraction of the total body surface area $A$, we can write $A_{exp} \\propto A$. Thus:\n$$R_{abs} \\propto J \\cdot A$$\n\nThe quantity of interest is the systemic absorption rate per kilogram of body mass, which we denote as $R'_{abs}$. This is obtained by dividing $R_{abs}$ by the body mass, $M$:\n$$R'_{abs} = \\frac{R_{abs}}{M} \\propto \\frac{J \\cdot A}{M} = J \\cdot \\left(\\frac{A}{M}\\right)$$\nLet's introduce a proportionality constant, $k$, which is identical for both the neonate and the adult, as it depends on the administration conditions.\n$$R'_{abs} = k \\cdot J \\cdot \\left(\\frac{A}{M}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we will write the specific expressions for the adult (subscript $a$) and the preterm neonate (subscript $n$).\n\nFor the adult:\n$$J_a = \\frac{K_a D_a \\Delta C_a}{h_a}$$\n$$R'_{abs, a} = k \\cdot J_a \\cdot \\left(\\frac{A}{M}\\right)_a = k \\cdot \\left(\\frac{K_a D_a \\Delta C_a}{h_a}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{A}{M}\\right)_a$$\n\nFor the preterm neonate:\nThe problem states that the intrinsic diffusion coefficient, partition coefficient, and concentration gradient are identical to the adult's ($K_n = K_a$, $D_n = D_a$, $\\Delta C_n = \\Delta C_a$). However, due to higher skin hydration, the overall transdermal transport is enhanced by a multiplicative factor $H$. This hydration factor effectively modifies the mass transport properties represented by the $K \\cdot D$ product. Therefore, the flux for the neonate can be written by incorporating this factor:\n$$J_n = H \\cdot \\frac{K_n D_n \\Delta C_n}{h_n} = H \\cdot \\frac{K_a D_a \\Delta C_a}{h_n}$$\nThe systemic absorption rate per kilogram for the neonate is:\n$$R'_{abs, n} = k \\cdot J_n \\cdot \\left(\\frac{A}{M}\\right)_n = k \\cdot \\left(H \\cdot \\frac{K_a D_a \\Delta C_a}{h_n}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{A}{M}\\right)_n$$\n\nTo find the required ratio, let's call it $\\mathcal{R}$, we divide the neonate's rate per kilogram by the adult's rate per kilogram:\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{R'_{abs, n}}{R'_{abs, a}} = \\frac{k \\cdot \\left(H \\cdot \\frac{K_a D_a \\Delta C_a}{h_n}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{A}{M}\\right)_n}{k \\cdot \\left(\\frac{K_a D_a \\Delta C_a}{h_a}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{A}{M}\\right)_a}$$\n\nThe identical terms $k$, $K_a$, $D_a$, and $\\Delta C_a$ cancel out, yielding the simplified symbolic expression for the ratio:\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{\\frac{H}{h_n} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{A}{M}\\right)_n}{\\frac{1}{h_a} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{A}{M}\\right)_a}$$\nRearranging the terms gives the final derived expression:\n$$\\mathcal{R} = H \\cdot \\frac{h_a}{h_n} \\cdot \\frac{\\left(\\frac{A}{M}\\right)_n}{\\left(\\frac{A}{M}\\right)_a}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this expression:\n$H = 1.8$\n$h_{a} = 15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n$h_{n} = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n$\\left(\\frac{A}{M}\\right)_{a} = 0.024\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,kg^{-1}}$\n$\\left(\\frac{A}{M}\\right)_{n} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,kg^{-1}}$\n\n$$\\mathcal{R} = 1.8 \\cdot \\frac{15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}} \\cdot \\frac{0.10\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,kg^{-1}}}{0.024\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,kg^{-1}}}$$\nThe units cancel, resulting in a dimensionless number as expected.\n$$\\mathcal{R} = 1.8 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{0.10}{0.024}\\right)$$\n$$\\mathcal{R} = 5.4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{100}{24}\\right) = 5.4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{25}{6}\\right)$$\n$$\\mathcal{R} = 0.9 \\cdot 25$$\n$$\\mathcal{R} = 22.5$$\n\nThe result, $22.5$, has three significant figures, which matches the required precision.

It is based on fundamental principles of pharmacokinetics, and all necessary parameters are provided for a unique solution. The values are within a plausible, albeit on the extreme side for $f_u$, range for neonatal pharmacology.\n\nThe loading dose (LD) is the initial dose of a drug required to rapidly achieve a target concentration. It is determined by the apparent volume of distribution ($V_d$) and the desired target total plasma concentration ($C_{\\text{total, target}}$). The fundamental relationship is:\n$$ \\text{LD} = V_d \\times C_{\\text{total, target}} $$\nThe apparent volume of distribution, $V_d$, is a proportionality constant that relates the total amount of drug in the body to the *total* concentration of the drug in plasma. It is not a true physiological volume but rather a parameter that accounts for the distribution of the drug throughout the various tissues and fluids of the body relative to the plasma.\n\nThe problem provides a target for the *free* (unbound) plasma concentration, $C_{u, \\text{target}}$, which is the pharmacologically active portion of the drug. The total concentration ($C_{\\text{total}}$) is the sum of the free concentration ($C_u$) and the protein-bound concentration ($C_b$). The relationship between free and total concentration is defined by the fraction unbound, $f_u$:\n$$ f_u = \\frac{C_u}{C_{\\text{total}}} $$\nTherefore, to use the loading dose equation, we must first calculate the target total concentration from the given target free concentration and a given fraction unbound.\n$$ C_{\\text{total, target}} = \\frac{C_{u, \\text{target}}}{f_u} $$\nSubstituting this into the primary loading dose equation yields the complete formula for this problem:\n$$ \\text{LD} = V_d \\times \\frac{C_{u, \\text{target}}}{f_u} $$\nThe question asks whether and why the loading dose requires correction for protein binding. Yes, the calculation explicitly depends on the protein binding characteristics of the drug, represented by $f_u$. The reason is that the loading dose definition is based on $V_d$, which relates drug amount to *total* concentration. Since the therapeutic target is specified for the *free* concentration, $f_u$ is the necessary parameter to bridge the gap and determine the corresponding total concentration that must be achieved in the plasma. A high $f_u$ value, such as the given $0.9$, signifies that only $10\\,\\%$ of the drug is bound to plasma proteins.
