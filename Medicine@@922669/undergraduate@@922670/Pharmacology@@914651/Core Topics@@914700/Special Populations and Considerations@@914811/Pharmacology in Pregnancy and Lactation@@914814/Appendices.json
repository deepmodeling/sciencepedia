During mid-pregnancy, hepatic glucuronidation increases, raising lamotrigine clearance and risking reduced exposure. The goal is to maintain the same steady-state concentration ($C_{ss}$) to preserve seizure control while minimizing teratogenic risk from switching or adding more teratogenic agents.\n\nAssume lamotrigine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics in the clinical range and oral bioavailability is unchanged in pregnancy.
