This can be modeled by considering the conservation of mass for the drug as it flows through the maternal intervillous space. We model the intervillous space as a system where maternal blood flows with a constant volumetric flow rate, $Q$, and the drug concentration, $C$, varies along the path of flow as it is transferred across the placental barrier.\n\nLet us consider a differential element of the exchange surface area, $dA$. The maternal blood concentration at the point corresponding to this element is $C$. The rate of drug transfer across this differential area is governed by Fick's first law of diffusion.
