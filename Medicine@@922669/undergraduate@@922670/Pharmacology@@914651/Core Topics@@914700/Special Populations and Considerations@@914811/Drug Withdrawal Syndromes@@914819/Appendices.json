To minimize drug withdrawal syndromes, the clinician aims to produce approximately equal decreases in synaptic target receptor occupancy each week, based on the pharmacologic principle that abrupt changes in receptor occupancy are more likely to precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Assume steady-state free plasma concentration is proportional to oral dose and that receptor occupancy follows a saturable binding model consistent with the Maximum Effect (Emax) framework.

The occupancy is given by:\n$$\n\\theta(D) = \\frac{D}{D + D_{50}}\n$$\nTo understand how a change in dose, $\\Delta D$, affects a change in occupancy, $\\Delta \\theta$, we can analyze the derivative of $\\theta(D)$ with respect to $D$. This derivative, $\\frac{d\\theta}{dD}$, represents the sensitivity of receptor occupancy to changes in dose.\n\nUsing the quotient rule for differentiation, with $u = D$ and $v = D + D_{50}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta}{dD} = \\frac{(1)(D + D_{50}) - (D)(1)}{(D + D_{50})^2} = \\frac{D_{50}}{(D + D_{50})^2}\n$$\nThis sensitivity, $\\frac{d\\theta}{dD}$, is not constant; it depends on the dose $D$. As the dose $D$ decreases, the denominator $(D + D_{50})^2$ decreases, causing the value of the derivative $\\frac{d\\theta}{dD}$ to increase. The sensitivity is highest at low doses and approaches its maximum value of $\\frac{1}{D_{50}}$ as $D \\rightarrow 0$.\n\nFor a discrete change in dose, $\\Delta D$, the corresponding change in occupancy, $\\Delta \\theta$, is approximately:\n$$\n\\Delta \\theta \\approx \\frac{d\\theta}{dD} \\Delta D = \\frac{D_{50}}{(D + D_{50})^2} \\Delta D\n$$\nTo keep $\\Delta \\theta$ constant at each step of the taper, the dose reduction $|\\Delta D|$ must be adjusted to account for the changing sensitivity. Specifically, we would need:\n$$\n|\\Delta D| \\approx \\frac{|\\Delta \\theta|_{\\text{constant}}}{\\frac{d\\theta}{dD}} = |\\Delta \\theta|_{\\text{constant}} \\times \\frac{(D + D_{50})^2}{D_{50}}\n$$\nThis shows that to maintain a constant drop in occupancy, the size of the dose reduction, $|\\Delta D|$, must decrease as the dose $D$ decreases. A taper schedule with smaller and smaller dose reductions at lower doses is required.\n\nNow, let's analyze the two proposed schedules using the given parameters: $D_0 = 40 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$ and $D_{50} = 10 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$.\n\n**Linear Schedule:** The dose is reduced by $\\Delta D = -5 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$ each week.\n-   Baseline: $D_0 = 40 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$, $\\theta(40) = \\frac{40}{40+10} = \\frac{40}{50} = 0.8$.\n-   Step 1: $D_1 = 35 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$. $\\theta(35) = \\frac{35}{35+10} = \\frac{35}{45} = \\frac{7}{9} \\approx 0.7778$.\n    $\\Delta \\theta_1 = \\theta(35) - \\theta(40) = \\frac{7}{9} - \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{35-36}{45} = -\\frac{1}{45} \\approx -0.0222$.\n-   Step 2: $D_2 = 30 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$. $\\theta(30) = \\frac{30}{30+10} = \\frac{30}{40} = 0.75$.\n    $\\Delta \\theta_2 = \\theta(30) - \\theta(35) = 0.75 - \\frac{7}{9} = \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{7}{9} = \\frac{27-28}{36} = -\\frac{1}{36} \\approx -0.0278$.\n-   Step 3: $D_3 = 25 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$. $\\theta(25) = \\frac{25}{25+10} = \\frac{25}{35} = \\frac{5}{7} \\approx 0.7143$.\n    $\\Delta \\theta_3 = \\theta(25) - \\theta(30) = \\frac{5}{7} - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{20-21}{28} = -\\frac{1}{28} \\approx -0.0357$.\nThe magnitude of the occupancy drop, $|\\Delta \\theta|$, increases with each step. The final drop from $5 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$ to $0 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$ would be $\\theta(0) - \\theta(5) = 0 - \\frac{5}{15} = -\\frac{1}{3} \\approx -0.3333$, a very large change.

The factor $r$ is chosen such that the first week's occupancy change matches the linear schedule. As calculated above, the first step of the linear schedule is from $D=40$ to $D=35$.

This option provides a complete and correct causal chain based on the provided model.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Because receptor occupancy is linear in dose across clinically relevant ranges, linear dose cuts produce equal changes in occupancy at all doses.**\n-   This premise is false. The provided model $\\theta(D) = \\frac{D}{D + D_{50}}$ is explicitly non-linear (hyperbolic). It is only approximately linear when $D \\ll D_{50}$, which is not true for the entire tapering range (e.g., $D_0 = 40 \\, \\mathrm{mg} = 4 D_{50}$). Our calculations for the linear taper directly disprove the conclusion that it produces equal changes in occupancy.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Because many psychotropics exhibit zero-order elimination, concentration does not decline proportionally with dose unless dose reductions are hyperbolic.**\n-   This option contradicts the problem's explicit assumption that \"steady-state free plasma concentration is proportional to oral dose,\" which implies linear (first-order) elimination, not zero-order. Zero-order elimination would lead to a non-proportional relationship between dose and steady-state concentration.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Because receptor upregulation during taper reduces $D_{50}$ over time, only hyperbolic dose reductions prevent increases in occupancy at low doses.**\n-   This option introduces a mechanism—receptor upregulation—that is not part of the problem statement. The analysis is to be based on the given model with fixed parameters. While receptor adaptation is a real biological phenomenon, it is not required to explain the superiority of a hyperbolic taper within the given framework. Furthermore, a taper is designed to decrease occupancy, not prevent increases.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Because competitive endogenous ligands change the proportionality between dose and concentration over time, linear tapers are intrinsically unstable and hyperbolic tapers correct this instability.**\n-   This option introduces another mechanism—the effect of endogenous ligands changing pharmacokinetics—that is not specified in the model. The problem states that concentration is proportional to dose, implying a stable relationship. The effect of endogenous ligands on binding is implicitly included in the constant $D_{50}$. There is no information to suggest this relationship changes over time.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4945269"}]}
