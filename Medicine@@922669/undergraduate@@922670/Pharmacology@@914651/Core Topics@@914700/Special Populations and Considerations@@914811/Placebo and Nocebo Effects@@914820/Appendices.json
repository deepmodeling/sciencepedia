It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective problem in biostatistics, representing a standard sample size calculation for a two-sample Z-test. All necessary information and constraints are provided without contradiction. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the required sample size per arm, $n$, for a two-sample test of means. Let $\\bar{X}_{D}$ and $\\bar{X}_{P}$ be the sample mean changes in pain intensity for the drug and placebo arms, respectively. Each arm has $n$ participants. The individual outcomes are assumed to be independent and identically distributed with a common variance $\\sigma^{2}$.\n\nFrom the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), for a sufficiently large sample size $n$, the sampling distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal.\nFor the drug arm, the sample mean $\\bar{X}_{D}$ is approximately normally distributed with mean $\\mu_{D}$ and variance $\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n}$. We write this as $\\bar{X}_{D} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu_{D}, \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n}\\right)$.\nSimilarly, for the placebo arm, $\\bar{X}_{P} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu_{P}, \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n}\\right)$.\n\nThe test concerns the difference in means, $\\mu_{D} - \\mu_{P}$. The estimator for this difference is $\\bar{X}_{D} - \\bar{X}_{P}$. Since the two arms are independent, the difference of their sample means is also approximately normally distributed.\nThe mean of the difference is $E[\\bar{X}_{D} - \\bar{X}_{P}] = E[\\bar{X}_{D}] - E[\\bar{X}_{P}] = \\mu_{D} - \\mu_{P}$.\nThe variance of the difference is $\\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_{D} - \\bar{X}_{P}) = \\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_{D}) + \\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_{P}) = \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n} = \\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}$.\nThus, the sampling distribution of the difference in sample means is $\\bar{X}_{D} - \\bar{X}_{P} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu_{D} - \\mu_{P}, \\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}\\right)$.\n\nThe null hypothesis is $H_{0}: \\mu_{D} - \\mu_{P} = 0$. Under $H_{0}$, the test statistic $Z$ is constructed by standardizing the observed difference in sample means:\n$$Z = \\frac{(\\bar{X}_{D} - \\bar{X}_{P}) - 0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}}} = \\frac{\\bar{X}_{D} - \\bar{X}_{P}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}}}$$\nUnder $H_{0}$, this statistic follows a standard normal distribution, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\n\nThe test has a two-sided type I error rate of $\\alpha$. We reject $H_{0}$ if the observed value of $|Z|$ is greater than the critical value $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$, where $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the quantile of the standard normal distribution such that $\\mathbb{P}(Z \\leq z_{1-\\alpha/2}) = 1-\\alpha/2$.\nThe rejection rule is therefore $|Z| > z_{1-\\alpha/2}$.\nThis is equivalent to rejecting $H_{0}$ if $\\frac{|\\bar{X}_{D} - \\bar{X}_{P}|}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^{2}/n}} > z_{1-\\alpha/2}$, which can be rewritten as:\n$$|\\bar{X}_{D} - \\bar{X}_{P}| > z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}}$$\n\nNext, we impose the power requirement. The power is $1-\\beta$, which is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_{0}$ when the alternative hypothesis $H_{1}$ is true. We are given a specific alternative of interest, where the true mean difference is $\\mu_{D} - \\mu_{P} = \\Delta$, with $\\Delta > 0$.\nPower is defined as $\\mathbb{P}(\\text{reject } H_{0} | \\mu_{D} - \\mu_{P} = \\Delta) = 1-\\beta$.\nThe Type II error, $\\beta$, is the probability of failing to reject $H_{0}$ when $\\mu_{D} - \\mu_{P} = \\Delta$:\n$$\\beta = \\mathbb{P}\\left(|\\bar{X}_{D} - \\bar{X}_{P}| \\leq z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}} \\;\\Bigg|\\; \\mu_{D} - \\mu_{P} = \\Delta\\right)$$\nUnder this alternative hypothesis, the distribution of the difference in sample means is $\\bar{X}_{D} - \\bar{X}_{P} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\Delta, \\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}\\right)$. To evaluate the probability $\\beta$, we standardize the variable $\\bar{X}_{D} - \\bar{X}_{P}$ using its distribution under $H_{1}$:\n$$Z' = \\frac{(\\bar{X}_{D} - \\bar{X}_{P}) - \\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}}} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$$\nThe condition for a Type II error becomes:\n$$\\beta = \\mathbb{P}\\left(-z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}} \\leq \\bar{X}_{D} - \\bar{X}_{P} \\leq z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}} \\;\\Bigg|\\; \\mu_{D} - \\mu_{P} = \\Delta\\right)$$\nWe transform the variables inside the probability expression to the standard normal scale $Z'$:\n$$\\beta = \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\frac{-z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}} - \\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}}} \\leq Z' \\leq \\frac{z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}} - \\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}}}\\right)$$\n$$\\beta = \\mathbb{P}\\left(-z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^{2}/n}} \\leq Z' \\leq z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^{2}/n}}\\right)$$\nFor a study to be meaningful, it must be adequately powered, which implies that the distribution under $H_{1}$ is shifted sufficiently far from the distribution under $H_{0}$. As $\\Delta > 0$, the mean of the distribution under $H_{1}$ is in the positive tail. The probability of erroneously failing to reject $H_0$ will be dominated by the mass of the $H_1$ distribution that falls below the upper rejection boundary, $z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{2\\sigma^{2}/n}$. The lower bound of the standardized interval, $-z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^{2}/n}}$, becomes a large negative number, and the probability of $Z'$ being less than this value is negligible. We can therefore approximate $\\beta$ as:\n$$\\beta \\approx \\mathbb{P}\\left(Z' \\leq z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^{2}/n}}\\right)$$\nBy the definition of the standard normal quantile $z_{p}$, if $\\mathbb{P}(Z' \\leq x) = \\beta$, then $x = z_{\\beta}$. Therefore, we set the argument of the probability function equal to $z_{\\beta}$:\n$$z_{\\beta} = z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^{2}/n}}$$\nUsing the symmetry of the standard normal distribution, we know that $z_{\\beta} = -z_{1-\\beta}$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$-z_{1-\\beta} = z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^{2}/n}}$$\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for the sample size $n$.\n$$z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta} = \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^{2}/n}}$$\nTo isolate $n$, we first solve for the term $\\sqrt{n}$:\n$$\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}} = \\frac{\\Delta}{z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta}}$$\n$$\\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{\\Delta}{z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta}}$$\n$$\\sqrt{n} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma(z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})}{\\Delta}$$\nFinally, we square both sides to obtain the expression for $n$:\n$$n = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma(z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})}{\\Delta}\\right)^{2}$$\n$$n = \\frac{2\\sigma^{2}(z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^{2}}{\\Delta^{2}}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the minimum sample size per arm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}(z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^{2}}{\\Delta^{2}}}$$", "id": "4979630"}, {"introduction": "Randomization is a powerful tool, but it does not guarantee perfect balance between groups, and natural fluctuations in symptoms can create statistical illusions.

The problem is free from the listed flaws.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Bias\nThe naive estimator for the average treatment effect on improvement is the simple difference in mean improvements between the treatment ($T$) and control ($C$) groups:\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{naive}} = \\bar{I}_{T} - \\bar{I}_{C}\n$$\nThe bias of this estimator is the difference between its expected value and the true treatment effect, $\\tau$. We assume the true effect $\\tau$ is the difference in improvement attributable to the drug, independent of baseline pain.\n\nThe problem states there is a linear association between baseline pain $X$ and improvement $I$ due to regression to the mean and other factors. We can model this relationship within each group. Let the true treatment effect be $\\tau$. The expected improvement for a subject, conditional on their baseline pain $x$, can be written as:\nFor the placebo group (C): $E[I_C | X=x] = \\alpha + b x$\nFor the treatment group (T): $E[I_T | X=x] = (\\alpha + \\tau) + b x$\nHere, $\\alpha$ represents the expected improvement for a patient with $X=0$ in the placebo group, and $b$ is the slope of the relationship between improvement and baseline, which is assumed to be common to both groups. The true treatment effect $\\tau$ is the additional improvement in the treatment group at any given level of baseline pain.\n\nTo find the expected value of the naive estimator, we take the expectation over the distribution of $X$ within each group. Using the law of total expectation, $E[I] = E[E[I|X]]$:\n$$\nE[\\bar{I}_{C}] = E \\left[ \\frac{1}{n_C} \\sum_{i \\in C} I_i \\right] = E[E[I_C | X]] = E[\\alpha + b X_C] = \\alpha + b E[X_C] = \\alpha + b \\mu_{X_C}\n$$\n$$\nE[\\bar{I}_{T}] = E \\left[ \\frac{1}{n_T} \\sum_{i \\in T} I_i \\right] = E[E[I_T | X]] = E[(\\alpha+\\tau) + b X_T] = (\\alpha+\\tau) + b E[X_T] = \\alpha + \\tau + b \\mu_{X_T}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_{X_C}$ and $\\mu_{X_T}$ are the true mean baseline values in the populations from which the control and treatment groups are sampled.\n\nThe expected value of the naive estimator is then:\n$$\nE[\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{naive}}] = E[\\bar{I}_T] - E[\\bar{I}_C] = (\\alpha + \\tau + b \\mu_{X_T}) - (\\alpha + b \\mu_{X_C}) = \\tau + b (\\mu_{X_T} - \\mu_{X_C})\n$$\nThe bias is defined as $E[\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{naive}}] - \\tau$.\n$$\n\\text{Bias} = [\\tau + b (\\mu_{X_T} - \\mu_{X_C})] - \\tau = b (\\mu_{X_T} - \\mu_{X_C})\n$$\nFor a specific trial with an observed baseline imbalance $\\Delta_{X} = \\bar{X}_{T} - \\bar{X}_{C}$, the bias introduced into the estimate is $b \\Delta_{X}$. This bias arises because the group that starts with a higher average baseline pain ($\\Delta_X > 0$) is expected to show a larger improvement due to regression to the mean alone, and this effect is confounded with the true treatment effect.\nUsing the definition of the slope $b$ given in the problem:\n$$\n\\text{Bias} = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(X,I)}{\\operatorname{Var}(X)} \\Delta_{X}\n$$\n\nPart 2: ANCOVA Adjustment\nThe problem specifies proposing an ANCOVA adjustment with a linear model for the $4$-week pain score $Y$, using baseline $X$ as a covariate. The ANCOVA model is:\n$$\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\tau_{A} Z_i + \\beta_1 X_i + \\epsilon_i\n$$\nwhere $Z_i$ is a treatment indicator ($Z_i=1$ for treatment, $Z_i=0$ for placebo), $\\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\\beta_1$ is the slope of $Y$ on $X$, and $\\tau_{A}$ is the ANCOVA treatment effect estimate.\n\nFrom first principles, the parameter $\\tau_A$ represents the difference in the expected outcome $Y$ between the two groups, holding baseline $X$ constant. It is an estimate of the treatment effect on the final pain score, adjusted for baseline. We want to understand how this relates to the bias in the effect on *improvement* $I$.\n\nLet's relate the parameters of the model for $Y$ to the parameters of the relationship for $I$. We know $I = X - Y$. Substituting the ANCOVA model for $Y$:\n$$\nI_i = X_i - (\\beta_0 + \\tau_{A} Z_i + \\beta_1 X_i + \\epsilon_i) = -\\beta_0 - \\tau_{A} Z_i + (1 - \\beta_1)X_i - \\epsilon_i\n$$\nThis reveals that the treatment effect on improvement is $\\tau = -\\tau_A$, and the slope of improvement $I$ on baseline $X$ is $b = 1 - \\beta_1$. This latter identity can be verified from the definition of covariance:\n$$\nb = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(X,I)}{\\operatorname{Var}(X)} = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(X, X-Y)}{\\operatorname{Var}(X)} = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(X,X) - \\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\operatorname{Var}(X)} = \\frac{\\operatorname{Var}(X)}{\\operatorname{Var}(X)} - \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\operatorname{Var}(X)} = 1 - \\beta_1\n$$\nThe Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimate for $\\tau_A$ in the ANCOVA model is given by:\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}_{A} = (\\bar{Y}_T - \\bar{Y}_C) - \\hat{\\beta}_1 (\\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C)\n$$\nThis estimator is unbiased for $\\tau_A$ under standard linear model assumptions. Therefore, an unbiased estimator for the treatment effect on improvement, $\\tau$, is $\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{ANCOVA}} = -\\hat{\\tau}_{A}$.\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{ANCOVA}} = - \\left[ (\\bar{Y}_T - \\bar{Y}_C) - \\hat{\\beta}_1 (\\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C) \\right] = (\\bar{Y}_C - \\bar{Y}_T) + \\hat{\\beta}_1 (\\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C)\n$$\nWe can express $\\bar{Y}_C - \\bar{Y}_T$ in terms of improvements and baselines: $\\bar{Y}_C - \\bar{Y}_T = (\\bar{X}_C - \\bar{I}_C) - (\\bar{X}_T - \\bar{I}_T) = (\\bar{I}_T - \\bar{I}_C) - (\\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C)$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{ANCOVA}}$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{ANCOVA}} = \\left[ (\\bar{I}_T - \\bar{I}_C) - (\\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C) \\right] + \\hat{\\beta}_1 (\\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C)\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{ANCOVA}} = (\\bar{I}_T - \\bar{I}_C) - (1 - \\hat{\\beta}_1)(\\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C)\n$$\nSince we showed that $b = 1 - \\beta_1$, and $\\hat{b}$ is the estimator for $b$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{ANCOVA}} = (\\bar{I}_T - \\bar{I}_C) - \\hat{b}(\\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C) = \\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{naive}} - \\text{Estimated Bias}\n$$\nThis derivation explicitly shows that the ANCOVA procedure, by including the baseline measurement $X$ as a covariate, calculates an adjusted treatment effect that is equivalent to taking the naive difference-in-means estimator and subtracting the estimated bias due to the baseline imbalance. Thus, ANCOVA removes the baseline-imbalance-induced bias.\n\nPart 3: Numerical Computation\nWe are asked to compute the numeric value of the bias implied by the data.\nFrom Part 1, the bias is given by:\n$$\n\\text{Bias} = b \\Delta_{X} = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(X,I)}{\\operatorname{Var}(X)} \\Delta_{X}\n$$\nThe given values are:\n$\\operatorname{Var}(X) = 6.76$\n$\\operatorname{Cov}(X,I) = 2.11$\n$\\Delta_{X} = 1.35$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for the bias:\n$$\n\\text{Bias} = \\left(\\frac{2.11}{6.76}\\right) \\times 1.35\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Bias} \\approx (0.3121301775...) \\times 1.35 \\approx 0.4213757...\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $0.421$.

The expected outcome, $\\mu_{ij} = E[Y|Drug=i, Expectation=j]$, for each of the four experimental cells can be expressed in terms of the model coefficients:\n- $\\mu_{00} = E[Y|Drug=0, Expectation=0] = \\beta_0$\n- $\\mu_{01} = E[Y|Drug=0, Expectation=1] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_2$\n- $\\mu_{10} = E[Y|Drug=1, Expectation=0] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1$\n- $\\mu_{11} = E[Y|Drug=1, Expectation=1] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 + \\beta_3$\n\nFrom these equations, we can express the interaction coefficient $\\beta_3$ in terms of the cell means.\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\beta_0$, $\\beta_1$ (as $\\mu_{10} - \\beta_0 = \\mu_{10} - \\mu_{00}$), and $\\beta_2$ (as $\\mu_{01} - \\beta_0 = \\mu_{01} - \\mu_{00}$) into the equation for $\\mu_{11}$:\n$$\n\\mu_{11} = \\mu_{00} + (\\mu_{10} - \\mu_{00}) + (\\mu_{01} - \\mu_{00}) + \\beta_3\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_{11} = \\mu_{10} + \\mu_{01} - \\mu_{00} + \\beta_3\n$$\nSolving for $\\beta_3$ gives the interaction effect:\n$$\n\\beta_3 = \\mu_{11} - \\mu_{10} - \\mu_{01} + \\mu_{00}\n$$\nThe value $\\mu_{10} + \\mu_{01} - \\mu_{00}$ represents the predicted mean in the $(1,1)$ cell under a purely additive model. The interaction term $\\beta_3$ quantifies the deviation from this additivity.\n\nThe best linear unbiased estimator for $\\beta_3$, denoted $\\hat{\\beta}_3$, is obtained by substituting the sample means $\\hat{\\mu}_{ij}$ for the population means $\\mu_{ij}$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_3 = \\hat{\\mu}_{11} - \\hat{\\mu}_{10} - \\hat{\\mu}_{01} + \\hat{\\mu}_{00}\n$$\nUsing the data provided: $\\hat{\\mu}_{00} = 1.0$, $\\hat{\\mu}_{01} = 2.0$, $\\hat{\\mu}_{10} = 3.0$, $\\hat{\\mu}_{11} = 5.8$.\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_3 = 5.8 - 3.0 - 2.0 + 1.0 = 1.8\n$$\nThe estimated interaction effect is $\\hat{\\beta}_3 = 1.8$. Since this value is positive, it suggests a supra-additive or synergistic effect: the observed mean $\\hat{\\mu}_{11}=5.8$ is greater than the value of $4.0$ predicted by the additive model ($\\hat{\\mu}_{10} + \\hat{\\mu}_{01} - \\hat{\\mu}_{00} = 3.0 + 2.0 - 1.0 = 4.0$).\n\nTo test the statistical significance of this finding, we construct a $t$-statistic for the null hypothesis $H_0: \\beta_3 = 0$. The $t$-statistic is given by:\n$$\nt = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_3 - 0}{SE(\\hat{\\beta}_3)}\n$$\nWe must first calculate the standard error of $\\hat{\\beta}_3$, $SE(\\hat{\\beta}_3)$. Since the four experimental groups are independent, the variance of the linear combination of sample means is the sum of their variances:\n$$\nVar(\\hat{\\beta}_3) = Var(\\hat{\\mu}_{11} - \\hat{\\mu}_{10} - \\hat{\\mu}_{01} + \\hat{\\mu}_{00}) = Var(\\hat{\\mu}_{11}) + Var(\\hat{\\mu}_{10}) + Var(\\hat{\\mu}_{01}) + Var(\\hat{\\mu}_{00})\n$$\nThe variance of a sample mean is $Var(\\hat{\\mu}_{ij}) = \\frac{\\sigma_{ij}^2}{n_{ij}}$. The problem states to assume homoscedasticity ($\\sigma_{ij}^2 = \\sigma^2$ for all cells) and provides equal sample sizes ($n_{ij} = n = 40$). Therefore:\n$$\nVar(\\hat{\\beta}_3) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} = \\frac{4\\sigma^2}{n}\n$$\nWe estimate the common population variance $\\sigma^2$ using the pooled sample variance $s_p^2$. Given that all cell sample standard deviations are equal ($s_{ij} = s = 2.5$) and all sample sizes are equal, the pooled variance is simply $s_p^2 = s^2$.\n$$\ns_p^2 = (2.5)^2 = 6.25\n$$\nThe estimated variance of $\\hat{\\beta}_3$ is:\n$$\n\\widehat{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_3) = \\frac{4 s_p^2}{n} = \\frac{4 \\times 6.25}{40} = \\frac{25}{40} = 0.625\n$$\nThe standard error is the square root of the estimated variance:\n$$\nSE(\\hat{\\beta}_3) = \\sqrt{0.625} \\approx 0.79057\n$$\nNow we can compute the $t$-statistic:\n$$\nt = \\frac{1.8}{\\sqrt{0.625}} \\approx \\frac{1.8}{0.79057} \\approx 2.2768\n$$\nThe degrees of freedom for this $t$-test are based on the total sample size minus the number of groups ($k=4$):\n$$\ndf = N_{total} - k = (4 \\times 40) - 4 = 160 - 4 = 156\n$$\nFor a two-tailed test with a significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$ and $df = 156$, the critical $t$-value is $t_{crit} = t_{0.025, 156}$. Using a standard $t$-distribution, this value is approximately $1.975$.\nSince our calculated test statistic $|t| \\approx 2.28$ is greater than the critical value $t_{crit} \\approx 1.975$, we reject the null hypothesis $H_0: \\beta_3 = 0$.\n\nThe result is statistically significant. The estimate of the interaction term, $\\hat{\\beta}_3 = 1.8$, is positive, indicating that the combined effect of the drug and positive expectation is greater than the sum of their individual effects. This is known as supra-additive synergy.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option:\n\nA. The placebo (expectation) and drug effects combine additively on the observed $Y$ scale; fail to reject $H_0:\\beta_3=0$.\nThis is **Incorrect**. The statistical test led to the rejection of the null hypothesis $H_0: \\beta_3=0$, which represents additivity.\n\nB. The placebo (expectation) and drug effects exhibit supra-additive synergy on the observed $Y$ scale; reject $H_0:\\beta_3=0$ with $\\hat{\\beta}_3>0$.\nThis is **Correct**. We rejected the null hypothesis of no interaction. The estimated interaction coefficient $\\hat{\\beta}_3 = 1.8$ is positive, which corresponds to a supra-additive synergistic effect.\n\nC. The placebo (expectation) and drug effects exhibit infra-additive antagonism on the observed $Y$ scale; reject $H_0:\\beta_3=0$ with $\\hat{\\beta}_3<0$.\nThis is **Incorrect**. Although we rejected the null hypothesis, our estimate of the interaction effect is positive ($\\hat{\\beta}_3 > 0$), not negative. A negative interaction would imply antagonism.\n\nD. The test is invalid because $Drug$ and $Expectation$ are collinear; $\\beta_3$ cannot be estimated in this design.\nThis is **Incorrect**. A key feature of a factorial design with independent randomization is that the factors are not collinear. In a balanced factorial design like this one, the predictors are orthogonal after mean-centering, which is an ideal condition for estimating all effects, including the interaction. The interaction coefficient $\\beta_3$ is clearly estimable, as demonstrated by the preceding calculations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4979655"}]}
