Age-related increases in adipose tissue change the apparent volume of distribution (volume of distribution, $V_{d}$) between an adult and a geriatric patient, while hepatic function and renal function are sufficiently preserved that systemic clearance (systemic clearance, $CL$) remains unchanged.

It presents a standard pharmacokinetic scenario that can be formalized and solved using fundamental principles.\n\nThe derivation and solution proceed as follows.\n\nFirst, we derive the relationship between elimination half-life ($t_{1/2}$), apparent volume of distribution ($V_d$), and systemic clearance ($CL$) from the definitions provided.\nLet $A(t)$ be the amount of drug in the body at time $t$, and let $C(t)$ be the drug concentration in plasma. In a one-compartment model, these are related by the apparent volume of distribution:\n$$A(t) = V_d \\cdot C(t)$$\nThe rate of change of the amount of drug in the body is equal to the negative of the rate of elimination. The problem defines clearance, $CL$, as the proportionality constant relating the rate of drug elimination to the concentration $C(t)$.\n$$\\text{Rate of Elimination} = CL \\cdot C(t)$$\nTherefore, the differential equation governing the amount of drug in the body is:\n$$\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -CL \\cdot C(t)$$\nSubstituting $A(t) = V_d \\cdot C(t)$ into the differential equation, and noting that $V_d$ is a constant for a given patient, we have:\n$$\\frac{d(V_d \\cdot C(t))}{dt} = V_d \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -CL \\cdot C(t)$$\nRearranging this gives the differential equation for concentration:\n$$\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{CL}{V_d} C(t)$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. The term $\\frac{CL}{V_d}$ is the first-order elimination rate constant, denoted as $k_{el}$.\n$$k_{el} = \\frac{CL}{V_d}$$\nThe solution to the differential equation $\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -k_{el} C(t)$ is an exponential decay function:\n$$C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-k_{el} t)$$\nwhere $C_0$ is the initial concentration at $t=0$.\n\nThe elimination half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time required for the concentration to decrease to one-half of its initial value. At $t=t_{1/2}$, we have $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} C_0$.\n$$\\frac{1}{2} C_0 = C_0 \\exp(-k_{el} t_{1/2})$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k_{el} t_{1/2})$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k_{el} t_{1/2}$$\n$$-\\ln(2) = -k_{el} t_{1/2}$$\nSolving for $t_{1/2}$ yields:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{el}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $k_{el}$:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2) V_d}{CL}$$\nThis completes the required derivation.

Determine the geriatric dosing interval, $\\tau_{\\text{ger}}$, that preserves the same fraction remaining at the end of the interval.\nThe fraction of drug remaining, $f$, after a dosing interval $\\tau$ is given by:\n$$f = \\frac{C(\\tau)}{C(0)} = \\frac{C_0 \\exp(-k_{el} \\tau)}{C_0} = \\exp(-k_{el} \\tau)$$\nFor the adult, the dosing interval is $\\tau_{\\text{adult}} = t_{1/2, \\text{adult}}$.
