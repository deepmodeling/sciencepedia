By calculating the apparent Michaelis constant, $K_m'$, you will gain a quantitative understanding of how a competitive inhibitor makes an enzyme appear to have a lower affinity for its substrate, a fundamental concept in pharmacology [@problem_id:4988355].", "problem": "Angiotensin I (Ang I) is converted to angiotensin II (Ang II) by Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) within the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS). Consider the catalytic scheme $E + S \\rightleftharpoons ES \\rightarrow E + P$ for ACE acting on Ang I, where $E$ denotes the enzyme, $S$ denotes the substrate (Ang I), and $P$ denotes the product (Ang II). Under the quasi-steady-state assumption, the Michaelis constant $K_m$ characterizes the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity reaches half of its maximal value $V_{\\max}$, and $V_{\\max}$ is the product of the catalytic rate constant and the total enzyme concentration. Now introduce a competitive Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) that binds to the free enzyme via $E + I \\rightleftharpoons EI$, where $I$ denotes the inhibitor, and define the inhibition constant $K_i$ by $K_i = \\frac{[E][I]}{[EI]}$. Assume that competitive inhibition leaves $V_{\\max}$ unchanged and only changes the apparent Michaelis constant due to partitioning of the free enzyme between $E$ and $EI$. Given $K_m = 100$ nM, inhibitor concentration $[I] = 50$ nM, and $K_i = 10$ nM, derive the apparent Michaelis constant in the presence of the inhibitor, denoted $K_m'$, from the mechanistic definitions above and compute its value. Express the final answer in nM. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the apparent Michaelis constant, $K_m'$, for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction in the presence of a competitive inhibitor. The reaction follows the general scheme provided.\n\nFirst, let us establish the foundational principles of Michaelis-Menten kinetics under the quasi-steady-state assumption. The reaction is described by:\n$$E + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_{cat}}{\\longrightarrow} E + P$$\nwhere $E$ is the enzyme, $S$ is the substrate, $ES$ is the enzyme-substrate complex, and $P$ is the product. The rate constants for each step are $k_1$, $k_{-1}$, and $k_{cat}$.\n\nThe quasi-steady-state assumption posits that the concentration of the intermediate complex, $[ES]$, remains constant over time, i.e., its rate of formation equals its rate of breakdown.\n$$ \\text{Rate of formation of } ES = k_1 [E][S] $$\n$$ \\text{Rate of breakdown of } ES = k_{-1} [ES] + k_{cat} [ES] = (k_{-1} + k_{cat})[ES] $$\nEquating these rates gives:\n$$ k_1 [E][S] = (k_{-1} + k_{cat})[ES] $$\nThe Michaelis constant, $K_m$, is defined as the ratio of constants on the right side to the constant on the left side:\n$$ K_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{cat}}{k_1} = \\frac{[E][S]}{[ES]} $$\nThe total enzyme concentration, $[E]_T$, is the sum of the free enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex:\n$$ [E]_T = [E] + [ES] $$\nThe reaction velocity, $v$, is the rate of product formation:\n$$ v = k_{cat}[ES] $$\nThe maximal velocity, $V_{\\max}$, is achieved when all enzyme is saturated with substrate, i.e., $[ES] = [E]_T$.\n$$ V_{\\max} = k_{cat}[E]_T $$\nBy algebraic manipulation of these equations, we can derive the Michaelis-Menten equation for the uninhibited reaction: $v = \\frac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_m + [S]}$. The problem asks for the derivation in the presence of an inhibitor, so we proceed to that case.\n\nNow, we introduce a competitive inhibitor, $I$, which binds reversibly only to the free enzyme, $E$:\n$$ E + I \\rightleftharpoons EI $$\nThe equilibrium for this reaction is characterized by the inhibition constant, $K_i$:\n$$ K_i = \\frac{[E][I]}{[EI]} $$\nIn the presence of the inhibitor, the total enzyme concentration, $[E]_T$, is distributed among three forms: free enzyme ($E$), enzyme-substrate complex ($ES$), and enzyme-inhibitor complex ($EI$).\n$$ [E]_T = [E] + [ES] + [EI] $$\nWe can express the concentration of the enzyme-inhibitor complex, $[EI]$, in terms of the free enzyme concentration, $[E]$, and the inhibitor concentration, $[I]$, using the definition of $K_i$:\n$$ [EI] = \\frac{[E][I]}{K_i} $$\nSubstituting this into the mass balance equation for the total enzyme:\n$$ [E]_T = [E] + [ES] + \\frac{[E][I]}{K_i} $$\nWe can factor out the free enzyme concentration, $[E]$, from the terms not involving $[ES]$:\n$$ [E]_T - [ES] = [E] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i} \\right) $$\nFrom the definition of $K_m$ derived earlier ($K_m = \\frac{[E][S]}{[ES]}$), we can express the free enzyme concentration as $[E] = \\frac{K_m [ES]}{[S]}$.

By comparing the two forms, we can identify the apparent Michaelis constant, $K_m'$, as:\n$$ K_m' = K_m \\left( 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i} \\right) $$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $K_m'$ using the given data:\n- Michaelis constant, $K_m = 100$ nM\n- Inhibitor concentration, $[I] = 50$ nM\n- Inhibition constant, $K_i = 10$ nM\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$ K_m' = 100 \\text{ nM} \\times \\left( 1 + \\frac{50 \\text{ nM}}{10 \\text{ nM}} \\right) $$\n$$ K_m' = 100 \\times \\left( 1 + 5 \\right) $$\n$$ K_m' = 100 \\times 6 $$\n$$ K_m' = 600 \\text{ nM} $$\nThe apparent Michaelis constant in the presence of the inhibitor is $600$ nM.
