Voltage-gated cardiac fast sodium channels cycle through resting, open, and inactivated states.\n    2.  Steady-state availability of sodium channels (fraction not inactivated) decreases sigmoidally as membrane potential depolarizes. A typical half-availability voltage is $V_{h}\\approx -75\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, with a slope factor of $k\\approx 6\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n    3.

Class IB antiarrhythmics (e.g., lidocaine) are weak sodium channel blockers, preferentially bind to the inactivated state, and dissociate rapidly during diastole at normal resting potentials.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem describes a classic and clinically relevant scenario in cardiac electrophysiology and pharmacology. The membrane potential values for normal ($-90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) and ischemic ($-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) tissue are standard textbook figures. The mechanism of ischemia (depolarization via elevated extracellular $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$) is well-established. The properties of sodium channel inactivation (inactivation curve parameters $V_h$ and $k$) and the defining characteristics of Class IB drugs (state-dependent binding, rapid dissociation kinetics) are fundamental concepts in this field. All premises are factually correct and grounded in established scientific principles.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a set of established principles and a specific clinical observation. It then asks for the mechanistic explanation that connects the principles to the observation. The information is sufficient and structured to allow for a unique, logical deduction.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology. The data provided are quantitative, and the principles are stated as objective biological facts.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a standard but non-trivial reasoning problem in pharmacology.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe goal is to explain the selective action of Class IB antiarrhythmics on ischemic myocardium based on the provided principles. This selectivity arises from two key phenomena: state-dependence and use-dependence.\n\n1.  **State-Dependence of Sodium Channel Availability:** The availability of sodium channels is voltage-dependent. The steady-state inactivation curve describes the fraction of channels in the resting (available) versus inactivated (unavailable) state. The given half-inactivation voltage is $V_{h}\\approx -75\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n    - In **normal myocardium**, the diastolic membrane potential is approximately $-90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. This potential is significantly more negative than $V_{h}$. At this potential, the vast majority of sodium channels are in the resting state, fully recovered from any previous inactivation and available to open upon the next stimulus.\n    - In the **ischemic border zone**, the diastolic membrane potential is depolarized to approximately $-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. This potential is significantly more positive than $V_{h}$. Consequently, a substantial fraction of sodium channels fails to recover from inactivation during diastole and remains in the steady-state inactivated state.\n\n2.  **State-Dependence of Class IB Drug Binding:** The problem states that Class IB agents \"preferentially bind to the inactivated state\".\n    - In **normal tissue** at $-90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, there are very few inactivated channels during diastole. This means there are few high-affinity binding sites for the drug.\n    - In **ischemic tissue** at $-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, the large population of inactivated channels provides abundant high-affinity targets for the Class IB drug. This property is known as **state-dependence**. The drug will thus have a much greater effect on the ischemic tissue because its target (the inactivated channel) is more prevalent.\n\n3.  **Use-Dependence and Dissociation Kinetics:** The problem states Class IB agents \"dissociate rapidly during diastole at normal resting potentials\". The drug's effect is a balance between binding during the action potential (when channels are open and then inactivated) and unbinding during diastole (when channels are resting).\n    - In **normal tissue** (diastolic potential $-90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$), the drug unbinds quickly from the resting channels during diastole. Even at a heart rate of $120\\,\\mathrm{beats/min}$ (cycle length $0.50\\,\\mathrm{s}$), the dissociation is efficient enough that significant block does not accumulate from one beat to the next.\n    - In **ischemic, tachycardic tissue**, two factors enhance the block. First, the high heart rate shortens the diastolic interval, providing less time for the drug to dissociate. Second, and more importantly, the diastolic potential is depolarized to $-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, which maintains a large pool of high-affinity inactivated channels and may also slow the dissociation rate itself, as the drug has low affinity for the resting state that is less populated. The combination of frequent channel activation (use) and incomplete recovery from block during the short, depolarized diastole leads to a cumulative increase in the number of blocked channels. This phenomenon is called **use-dependence**.\n\n**Conclusion:** Class IB drugs are selective for ischemic tissue because the depolarized resting potential in this tissue ($-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) causes a significant fraction of sodium channels to be in the inactivated state, which is the high-affinity target for these drugs (state-dependence). The fast heart rate further enhances this block by not allowing sufficient time for the drug to dissociate between beats (use-dependence). Normal tissue is spared because its negative resting potential ($-90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) keeps channels in the low-affinity resting state and allows for rapid drug dissociation during diastole.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Ischemia depolarizes myocytes (to about $-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$), shifting sodium channels into the inactivated state; Class IB agents preferentially bind inactivated channels and, because they dissociate rapidly at more negative diastolic potentials (about $-90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$), produce strong state- and use-dependent block in ischemic, tachycardic tissue while exerting minimal effect in normally polarized myocardium.**\n- This option correctly identifies all the critical components of the mechanism: depolarization due to ischemia, the resulting increase in inactivated sodium channels, the preferential binding of the drug to this state (state-dependence), and the accumulation of block in tachycardic, depolarized tissue due to insufficient time for dissociation between beats (use-dependence). It also correctly describes why normal tissue is spared (negative potential, rapid dissociation). This statement is a perfect summary of the derived mechanism.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Ischemia acidifies the extracellular space, increasing the neutral fraction of lidocaine so that membrane permeability and intracellular drug levels increase uniformly in all regions, yielding equal suppression independent of firing rate or membrane potential.**\n- This option is incorrect for several reasons. First, extracellular acidosis (lower pH) would increase the proportion of the protonated (charged) form of a weak basic drug like lidocaine, not the neutral form, thereby *reducing* its ability to cross the membrane. Second, it incorrectly claims that suppression would be \"uniform\" and \"independent of firing rate or membrane potential,\" which directly contradicts the well-established principles of state- and use-dependence that are central to the action of Class IB drugs and are included in the problem's premises.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Class IB agents strongly block resting sodium channels regardless of membrane potential, but ischemic myocytes express a higher density of sodium channels per cell, making them more susceptible.**\n- This option makes two false claims. First, it states that Class IB agents block *resting* channels, which contradicts the provided principle that they preferentially bind *inactivated* channels. Their blocking action is highly dependent on membrane potential and channel state. Second, the claim that ischemic myocytes express a higher density of sodium channels is not a generally accepted acute effect of ischemia and is not supported by the givens.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Class IB agents primarily block L-type calcium channels in ischemic tissue, thereby reducing phase $0$ upstroke selectively in that region.**\n- This option is fundamentally incorrect. Class IB agents are, by definition, sodium channel blockers (Class I). L-type calcium channel blockers are Class IV antiarrhythmics. Furthermore, the rapid depolarization phase, phase $0$, of the ventricular action potential is mediated by the influx of $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ through fast sodium channels, not $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ through L-type calcium channels.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Class IB agents markedly prolong action potential duration and effective refractory period only in ischemic tissue, abolishing reentry without affecting normal myocardium.**\n- This option misrepresents the effect of Class IB drugs on the action potential duration (APD). The defining characteristic of Class IB agents is that they either have no effect on APD or, more commonly, *shorten* it, especially in depolarized tissue. Class IA agents are the ones that prolong APD. The claim of marked prolongation is factually wrong.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4920516"}, {"introduction": "The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a critical tool for monitoring the effects of antiarrhythmic drugs. This exercise focuses on the hallmark effect of Class I agents: slowing of intraventricular conduction.

Express your final numerical result as a unitless decimal number (negative for a decrease), rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem presents a valid and well-posed question grounded in fundamental principles of cardiac electrophysiology and pharmacology. We shall proceed with the solution in three parts as requested: justification, derivation, and numerical evaluation.\n\nFirst, we justify why QRS widening on the electrocardiogram signals intraventricular conduction slowing. The problem states that the QRS duration, which we can denote as an activation time $t$, represents the time required for the wave of ventricular depolarization to travel across a fixed path length $\\ell$. The conduction velocity, $v$, is defined by the relationship:\n$$v = \\frac{\\ell}{t}$$\nGiven that the intraventricular activation path length $\\ell$ is considered constant (as the heart structure is unchanged), this equation shows that the conduction velocity $v$ is inversely proportional to the activation time $t$. An increase in the QRS duration, from a baseline of $t_{0}$ to a post-drug duration of $t_{1}$, means that $t_{1} > t_{0}$. Due to the inverse proportionality, it must follow that the post-drug conduction velocity $v_{1}$ is less than the baseline velocity $v_{0}$. Thus, QRS widening is a direct indicator of slowed intraventricular conduction. The specified Class I antiarrhythmic agent causes this effect by blocking fast voltage-gated sodium channels, which are responsible for the rapid phase $0$ depolarization of the cardiac action potential. Slowing this phase reduces the rate of impulse propagation between myocytes, manifesting as a decrease in conduction velocity.\n\nSecond, we derive an expression for the fractional change in conduction velocity, $\\frac{v_{1} - v_{0}}{v_{0}}$, in terms of the initial and final activation times, $t_{0}$ and $t_{1}$.\nThe initial velocity is $v_{0} = \\frac{\\ell}{t_{0}}$.\nThe final velocity after drug administration is $v_{1} = \\frac{\\ell}{t_{1}}$.\nThe fractional change in velocity is given by the expression $\\frac{v_{1} - v_{0}}{v_{0}}$. We can rewrite this as:\n$$\\frac{v_{1} - v_{0}}{v_{0}} = \\frac{v_{1}}{v_{0}} - 1$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $v_{0}$ and $v_{1}$:\n$$\\frac{v_{1} - v_{0}}{v_{0}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\ell}{t_{1}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{\\ell}{t_{0}}\\right)} - 1$$\nThe constant path length $\\ell$ cancels out from the numerator and denominator:\n$$\\frac{v_{1} - v_{0}}{v_{0}} = \\frac{t_{0}}{t_{1}} - 1$$\nTo express this as a single fraction in terms of $t_{0}$ and $t_{1}$, we find a common denominator:\n$$\\frac{v_{1} - v_{0}}{v_{0}} = \\frac{t_{0} - t_{1}}{t_{1}}$$\nThis is the desired expression for the fractional change in conduction velocity.\n\nThird, we evaluate this fractional change numerically. The problem provides the baseline QRS duration $t_{0} = 100\\ \\text{ms}$ and the increase in duration $\\Delta t = 20\\ \\text{ms}$. The final duration is $t_{1} = t_{0} + \\Delta t$.\nWe can substitute $t_{1} = t_{0} + \\Delta t$ into our derived expression. Note that $t_{0} - t_{1} = t_{0} - (t_{0} + \\Delta t) = -\\Delta t$.\nSo, the fractional change can be written as:\n$$\\frac{v_{1} - v_{0}}{v_{0}} = \\frac{-\\Delta t}{t_{0} + \\Delta t}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\\frac{v_{1} - v_{0}}{v_{0}} = \\frac{-20\\ \\text{ms}}{100\\ \\text{ms} + 20\\ \\text{ms}} = \\frac{-20}{120}$$\nSimplifying the fraction gives:\n$$\\frac{v_{1} - v_{0}}{v_{0}} = -\\frac{1}{6}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives approximately $-0.16666...$. The problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\frac{v_{1} - v_{0}}{v_{0}} \\approx -0.1667$$\nThe negative sign correctly indicates a decrease in conduction velocity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.1667}$$", "id": "4920574"}, {"introduction": "Effective clinical practice requires not only understanding a drug's primary mechanism but also anticipating its side effects and complex behaviors.

Sotalol is a well-known antiarrhythmic drug with both Class II ($\\beta$-adrenergic blockade) and Class III ($K^{+}$ channel blockade, specifically $I_{Kr}$) properties. Its effects on heart rate (bradycardia) and the QT interval (prolongation) are its defining characteristics. The values given for the heart rate change ($75\\,\\mathrm{bpm}$ to $55\\,\\mathrm{bpm}$) and QTc prolongation (from $440\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ to $510\\,\\mathrm{ms}$) are clinically realistic and significant. The underlying principles—action potential phases, the role of $I_{Kr}$, and the concept of reverse use-dependence—are cornerstones of cardiac electrophysiology. There are no scientific or factual unsoundnesses.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem presents a specific, self-contained clinical scenario with sufficient data to allow for a reasoned conclusion based on the requested principles. It asks for the \"most appropriate immediate intervention,\" which is a standard format for clinical reasoning problems that require prioritizing actions based on risk. A unique, best answer can be determined from the options.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in objective, clinical language. The data are quantitative ($QTc$, heart rate) and the context is based on established pharmacodynamic principles. It is free of subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. There are no identifiable flaws.\n\n**Verdict: The problem is valid.** The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe decision regarding the most appropriate intervention must be based on an understanding of the electrophysiological effects of sotalol and the clinical risks they entail.\n\n1.  **Mechanism of Sotalol and QT Prolongation:** The QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG) represents the total duration of ventricular depolarization and repolarization. Its length is primarily determined by the duration of the ventricular myocyte action potential (AP). Sotalol, as a Class III agent, exerts its antiarrhythmic effect by blocking the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, $I_{Kr}$. This current is critical for Phase $3$ repolarization of the cardiac action potential. By inhibiting $I_{Kr}$, sotalol slows potassium efflux from the cell, thereby prolonging the action potential duration (APD) and, consequently, the QT interval.\n\n2.  **Risk of Torsades de Pointes (TdP):** While prolonging the APD can terminate re-entrant arrhythmias, excessive prolongation creates a pro-arrhythmic substrate. Specifically, it can lead to the development of early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which are oscillations in membrane potential during the plateau or repolarization phase. If these EADs reach the threshold potential, they can trigger a life-threatening polymorphic ventricular tachycardia known as Torsades de Pointes (TdP). A corrected QT interval (QTc) exceeding $500\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ is a widely accepted threshold that indicates a significantly elevated risk of TdP. The patient's QTc has increased to $510\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, placing them in a high-risk category. Furthermore, an increase in QTc of more than $60\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ from baseline is also an independent risk factor; this patient has experienced an increase of $70\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\n3.  **Reverse Use-Dependence:** A crucial pharmacodynamic property of sotalol and other $I_{Kr}$ blockers is **reverse use-dependence**. This term describes the phenomenon where the drug's blocking effect is more pronounced at slower heart rates. With bradycardia, the diastolic interval (the time between action potentials) is longer. This allows more drug molecules to bind to the $I_{Kr}$ channels and for less drug-channel unbinding to occur. Consequently, the APD and QT interval are prolonged to a greater extent at slower heart rates.\n\n4.  **Synthesis of the Clinical Picture:** The patient is being treated with sotalol, which has two relevant effects:\n    -   **Class II ($\\beta$-blockade) effect:** This has caused the patient's heart rate to decrease from $75\\,\\mathrm{bpm}$ to a bradycardic rate of $55\\,\\mathrm{bpm}$.\n    -   **Class III ($I_{Kr}$ blockade) effect:** This has prolonged the QTc to a dangerous level of $510\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n    The bradycardia induced by the Class II effect is actively exacerbating the QT prolongation caused by the Class III effect, due to reverse use-dependence. This combination is particularly pro-arrhythmic and demands immediate intervention to prevent TdP.\n\n5.  **Principles of Management:** The immediate management strategy must focus on reducing the risk of TdP. This involves:\n    -   Removing the offending agent (sotalol).\n    -   Managing all other modifiable risk factors for TdP, such as electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia).\n    -   Directly counteracting the electrophysiological effect of reverse use-dependence, which can be achieved by increasing the heart rate.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Continue sotalol and observe, because QTc below $550\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ is acceptable and bradycardia reduces the risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias.**\nThis statement contains two critical errors. First, a QTc of $510\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ is not \"acceptable\"; it signifies a high risk of TdP and warrants immediate action. A QTc > $500\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ is a standard threshold for intervention. Second, the assertion that bradycardia reduces risk is dangerously incorrect in this specific context. Due to reverse use-dependence, the sotalol-induced bradycardia is *increasing* the risk of TdP, a specific type of ventricular tachyarrhythmia.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Hold sotalol immediately, correct potassium and magnesium toward high-normal ranges, avoid other QT-prolonging drugs, and if rhythm control remains necessary consider increasing heart rate (for example, temporary pacing) or switching to an agent without dominant IKr blockade.**\nThis option comprehensively addresses all aspects of the high-risk situation. Holding sotalol removes the primary cause. Correcting electrolytes ($K^+$ and $Mg^{2+}$) mitigates key synergistic risk factors for TdP. Avoiding other QT-prolonging drugs prevents additive toxicity. Considering an increase in heart rate (e.g., via pacing) directly counteracts the mechanism of reverse use-dependence, making it a sound acute strategy. Finally, planning to switch to an agent with a different mechanism is the correct long-term approach if rhythm control is still needed. This is the most appropriate and complete intervention.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Add digoxin to further slow atrioventricular nodal conduction, thereby lowering heart rate and shortening repolarization time.**\nAdding digoxin would likely further decrease the heart rate, which is already low at $55\\,\\mathrm{bpm}$. This would worsen the QT prolongation due to reverse use-dependence, thereby increasing the risk of TdP. While digoxin has complex and minor effects on repolarization, its dominant and dangerous effect in this scenario would be exacerbating the bradycardia. This intervention would be contraindicated.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Replace sotalol with dofetilide to preserve Class III effects while removing beta-adrenergic blockade, thereby reducing QT prolongation.**\nDofetilide is a \"pure\" Class III agent that also potently blocks $I_{Kr}$ and exhibits significant reverse use-dependence. While removing the $\\beta$-blockade might allow the heart rate to increase, switching to another drug of the same high-risk class in a patient who has just demonstrated marked sensitivity (QTc $510\\,\\mathrm{ms}$) is not a safe immediate intervention. The a priori risk of TdP with dofetilide is substantial, and initiating it in this patient would be hazardous without first allowing the QTc to normalize and reassessing risk.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Administer intravenous magnesium sulfate prophylactically and continue sotalol, as magnesium stabilizes repolarization regardless of ongoing IKr blockade.**\nAdministering intravenous magnesium is a correct component of managing a patient at high risk for TdP. However, *continuing sotalol* is a critical error. Magnesium is a treatment or prophylaxis for TdP, but it does not reverse the underlying $I_{Kr}$ blockade caused by the drug. Continuing the offending agent while attempting to mitigate its toxicity is fundamentally flawed and unsafe clinical practice. The primary cause of the problem must be removed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4920552"}]}
