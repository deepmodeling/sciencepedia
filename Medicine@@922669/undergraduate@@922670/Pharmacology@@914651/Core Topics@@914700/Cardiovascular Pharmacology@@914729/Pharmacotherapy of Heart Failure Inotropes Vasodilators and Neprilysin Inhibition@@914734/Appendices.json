It is well-posed, with all necessary data provided to compute a unique solution. The scenario is clinically plausible and the question is objective.\n\nThe fundamental relationship governing systemic blood flow is that cardiac output ($CO$) is the product of heart rate ($HR$) and stroke volume ($SV$). This is expressed by the equation:\n$$CO = HR \\times SV$$\n\nWe are given the initial conditions and a specific change, allowing us to calculate the initial and final cardiac output values and, consequently, the change in cardiac output.\n\nLet us define the variables based on the problem statement:\n- Initial heart rate, $HR = 90 \\text{ beats/minute}$. This is stated to be constant.\n- Initial stroke volume, $SV_{initial} = 50 \\text{ milliliters/beat}$.\n- Percentage increase in stroke volume = $20\\%$, which corresponds to a multiplicative factor of $1.20$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial cardiac output ($CO_{initial}$) using the provided baseline values.\n$$CO_{initial} = HR \\times SV_{initial}$$\nSubstituting the given numbers:\n$$CO_{initial} = 90 \\frac{\\text{beats}}{\\text{min}} \\times 50 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{beat}} = 4500 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}}$$\n\nNext, we determine the final stroke volume ($SV_{final}$) after the administration of the inotrope.

This is a critical and valid assumption, as it isolates the effect of the inotrope to contractility (the \"ino-\" part of inotropy) and removes any confounding chronotropic (heart rate) effects the drug might otherwise have.\n2.  **Isolated Inotropic Effect on Stroke Volume:** The calculation assumes that the $20\\%$ increase in stroke volume is entirely due to the increased myocardial contractility from the inotrope. It presumes that other determinants of stroke volume—namely preload (ventricular end-diastolic volume) and afterload (systemic vascular resistance)—do not change in a way that would significantly alter this effect. In a real physiological system, an increase in cardiac output could alter systemic blood pressure and vascular resistance, creating a feedback loop that could modulate the final stroke volume. The calculation assumes such feedback effects are negligible or are already accounted for in the measured $20\\%$ change.\n3.  **No Significant Pharmacodynamic Interactions:** The patient is also on an ARNI and a beta-blocker. The calculation assumes that the positive inotropic effect is not significantly potentiated or attenuated by these concomitant medications in a way that is not already captured by the given $20\\%$ increase. For example, the beta-blocker would generally oppose positive inotropic and chronotropic stimulation of the heart, but the net effect observed is the $20\\%$ increase.\n4.  **Measurement Accuracy:** The calculation is contingent upon the accuracy of the provided measurements: a stroke volume of exactly $50$ milliliters and an increase of exactly $20.0\\%$. In clinical practice, these values are obtained through methods like echocardiography, which have inherent measurement variability.\n5.  **Stable Systemic Conditions:** The model assumes the patient's overall condition (e.g., volume status, metabolic rate, body temperature) remains stable during the measurement period, such that the only significant variable changing is the inotropic state of the myocardium.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.900}$$", "id": "4977235"}, {"introduction": "Moving from basic principles to clinical application requires translating pharmacodynamic theory into a precise dosage.

The calculated value of $18$ is expressed as $18.0$.\n\n**Essential Bedside Monitoring and Safety Limits**\nWhile not part of the graded calculation, professional responsibility dictates outlining the necessary clinical monitoring for a potent agent like sodium nitroprusside in a high-risk patient.\n1.  **Hemodynamic Monitoring**: Continuous intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring is essential for safe titration due to the drug's rapid onset and short duration of action.

It requires the application of fundamental biochemical principles to a clinically relevant scenario.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n## DERIVATION OF THE SOLUTION\n\nThe problem requires us to derive an expression for the fractional occupancy of the $\\text{Na}^+/\\text{K}^+$-ATPase by a cardiac glycoside in the presence of a competing ligand, potassium. Let $E$ represent the free $\\text{Na}^+/\\text{K}^+$-ATPase pump, $D$ the glycoside, and $K^+$ the extracellular potassium ion. The binding is competitive and mutually exclusive, described by the following equilibria:\n\n$$E + D \\rightleftharpoons ED \\quad \\text{with dissociation constant} \\quad K_D = \\frac{[E][D]}{[ED]}$$\n$$E + K^+ \\rightleftharpoons EK \\quad \\text{with dissociation constant} \\quad K_K = \\frac{[E][K^+]_\\text{out}}{[EK]}$$\n\nThe total concentration of pumps, $[E]_\\text{total}$, is the sum of the unbound pumps and the pumps bound to either ligand:\n$$[E]_\\text{total} = [E] + [ED] + [EK]$$\n\nFrom the dissociation constant definitions, we can express the concentrations of the bound forms in terms of the free form $[E]$:\n$$[ED] = \\frac{[E][D]}{K_D}$$\n$$[EK] = \\frac{[E][K^+]_\\text{out}}{K_K}$$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $[E]_\\text{total}$:\n$$[E]_\\text{total} = [E] + \\frac{[E][D]}{K_D} + \\frac{[E][K^+]_\\text{out}}{K_K} = [E] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[D]}{K_D} + \\frac{[K^+]_\\text{out}}{K_K} \\right)$$\n\nThe fractional occupancy by the glycoside, $\\theta_D$, is the ratio of pumps bound to the drug to the total number of pumps:\n$$\\theta_D = \\frac{[ED]}{[E]_\\text{total}} = \\frac{\\frac{[E][D]}{K_D}}{[E] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[D]}{K_D} + \\frac{[K^+]_\\text{out}}{K_K} \\right)}$$\n$$\\theta_D = \\frac{\\frac{[D]}{K_D}}{1 + \\frac{[D]}{K_D} + \\frac{[K^+]_\\text{out}}{K_K}}$$\n\nThe problem states that the toxicity risk index $R$ is proportional to this fractional occupancy, $R \\propto \\theta_D$. Therefore, the ratio of the risk index in hypokalemia ($R_\\text{hypoK}$) to that in normokalemia ($R_\\text{normoK}$) is equal to the ratio of the corresponding fractional occupancies:\n$$\\frac{R_\\text{hypoK}}{R_\\text{normoK}} = \\frac{\\theta_{D, \\text{hypoK}}}{\\theta_{D, \\text{normoK}}}$$\n\nWe must now calculate the fractional occupancy for each state.
