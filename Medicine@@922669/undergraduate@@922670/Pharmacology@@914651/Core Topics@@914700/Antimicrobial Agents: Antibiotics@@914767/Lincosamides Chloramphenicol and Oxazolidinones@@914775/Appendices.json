This exercise guides you through the process of deriving fundamental pharmacokinetic parameters, such as the elimination half-life ($t_{1/2}$), directly from the core definitions of clearance ($CL$) and volume of distribution ($V$). By working from these first principles, you will gain a robust theoretical foundation for determining an appropriate dosing interval for a drug like chloramphenicol, ensuring its concentration remains within the therapeutic window.

It is scientifically grounded in the fundamental principles of pharmacokinetics, presents a well-posed problem with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed in objective, formal language. All components of the problem are amenable to rigorous mathematical treatment.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested, followed by the final numerical computation.\n\n1. Derivation of the elimination rate constant $k$ in terms of clearance $CL$ and volume of distribution $V$.\n\nLet $A(t)$ be the amount of drug in the body at time $t$ and $C(t)$ be the plasma concentration of the drug at time $t$. The problem provides two fundamental definitions:\nThe apparent volume of distribution, $V$, is defined as:\n$$V = \\frac{A(t)}{C(t)}$$\nRearranging this gives the amount of drug in the body as a function of concentration:\n$$A(t) = V \\cdot C(t)$$\nClearance, $CL$, is defined as the ratio of the elimination rate to the plasma concentration. The elimination rate is the rate of decrease of the amount of drug in the body, which is mathematically expressed as $-\\frac{dA(t)}{dt}$.\n$$CL = \\frac{-\\frac{dA(t)}{dt}}{C(t)}$$\nFor a first-order elimination process, the rate of elimination is directly proportional to the amount of drug in the body. The constant of proportionality is the first-order elimination rate constant, $k$.\n$$-\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = k \\cdot A(t)$$\nNow, we can substitute this expression for the elimination rate into the definition of clearance:\n$$CL = \\frac{k \\cdot A(t)}{C(t)}$$\nNext, substitute the expression for $A(t)$ from the definition of the volume of distribution, $A(t) = V \\cdot C(t)$, into the equation for $CL$:\n$$CL = \\frac{k \\cdot (V \\cdot C(t))}{C(t)}$$\nAssuming a non-zero concentration $C(t)$, the term cancels out, leaving a direct relationship between $CL$, $k$, and $V$:\n$$CL = k \\cdot V$$\nSolving for the elimination rate constant, $k$, yields the desired expression:\n$$k = \\frac{CL}{V}$$\n\n2. Derivation of the elimination half-life $t_{1/2}$ in terms of $k$.\n\nThe amount of drug in the body, $A(t)$, undergoing first-order elimination from an initial amount $A_0$ at time $t=0$ is described by the differential equation $-\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = k \\cdot A(t)$. The solution to this equation is an exponential decay function:\n$$A(t) = A_0 \\exp(-kt)$$\nThe elimination half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time required for the amount of drug in the body to decrease to one-half of its initial value. At $t = t_{1/2}$, the amount is $A(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{A_0}{2}$.\nSubstituting this into the decay equation:\n$$\\frac{A_0}{2} = A_0 \\exp(-k t_{1/2})$$\nDividing both sides by $A_0$ (assuming $A_0 > 0$):\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2})$$\nTo solve for $t_{1/2}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\ln(\\exp(-k t_{1/2}))$$\nUsing the logarithmic identity $\\ln(e^x) = x$, we have:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k t_{1/2}$$\nAnd using the property $\\ln(\\frac{1}{x}) = -\\ln(x)$:\n$$-\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2}$$\nSolving for $t_{1/2}$ gives the final expression:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}$$\n\n3. Determination of the longest dosing interval $\\tau$ in terms of $k$.\n\nFor repeated IV bolus dosing at a fixed interval $\\tau$, a steady state is reached where the amount of drug eliminated over one interval equals the dose administered. Let $C_{ss,peak}$ be the peak plasma concentration at steady state (immediately after a dose) and $C_{ss,trough}$ be the trough concentration at steady state (immediately before the next dose).\nBetween doses, the concentration decays exponentially with the rate constant $k$. Therefore, the trough concentration is related to the peak concentration from the same interval by:\n$$C_{ss,trough} = C_{ss,peak} \\exp(-k\\tau)$$\nThe problem imposes the constraint that the peak-to-trough ratio at steady state does not exceed $2$:\n$$\\frac{C_{ss,peak}}{C_{ss,trough}} \\le 2$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{ss,trough}$:\n$$\\frac{C_{ss,peak}}{C_{ss,peak} \\exp(-k\\tau)} \\le 2$$\nThe term $C_{ss,peak}$ cancels, and $\\frac{1}{\\exp(-k\\tau)} = \\exp(k\\tau)$. The inequality becomes:\n$$\\exp(k\\tau) \\le 2$$\nTo find the longest possible dosing interval, $\\tau_{max}$, that satisfies this criterion, we set the expression to its maximum allowed value:\n$$\\exp(k\\tau_{max}) = 2$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$k\\tau_{max} = \\ln(2)$$\nSolving for $\\tau_{max}$ (which we will simply call $\\tau$ as per the problem's request for the longest interval):\n$$\\tau = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}$$\n\nNumerical computation.\nThe provided values are $V = 40\\,\\text{L}$ and $CL = 15\\,\\text{L/h}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the elimination rate constant $k$:\n$$k = \\frac{CL}{V} = \\frac{15\\,\\text{L/h}}{40\\,\\text{L}} = 0.375\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$$\nNext, we compute the elimination half-life $t_{1/2}$:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.375\\,\\text{h}^{-1}} \\approx \\frac{0.693147}{0.375}\\,\\text{h} \\approx 1.84839\\,\\text{h}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $t_{1/2} = 1.848\\,\\text{h}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the longest dosing interval $\\tau$:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.375\\,\\text{h}^{-1}} \\approx 1.84839\\,\\text{h}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\tau = 1.848\\,\\text{h}$.\nThe numerical values for the half-life and the longest dosing interval (for a peak-to-trough ratio of $2$) are identical.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1.848 & 1.848 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4960623"}, {"introduction": "In clinical practice, the ability to switch a patient from intravenous to oral medication offers significant benefits, but this decision must be supported by pharmacokinetic data.

The calculated absolute bioavailability of $F \\approx 0.923$ is very high. A bioavailability value close to $1$ indicates that the oral route is nearly as efficient as the intravenous route at delivering the drug to the bloodstream. The ratio of exposures for the same dose ($600\\,\\text{mg}$) is directly given by the ratio of the AUCs, which is $\\frac{AUC_{\\mathrm{po}}}{AUC_{\\mathrm{iv}}} = \\frac{120}{130} \\approx 0.923$. This ratio falls squarely within the conventional bioequivalence interval of $0.80$ to $1.25$ used by regulatory agencies for determining if two formulations provide comparable systemic exposure. Although this problem does not provide the statistical data (e.g., confidence intervals) required for a formal bioequivalence assessment, the point estimate of the exposure ratio is very close to $1.0$. Therefore, based on the high bioavailability and the resulting comparable drug exposure, it is reasonable to conclude that the oral and intravenous routes are clinically interchangeable.
