This index is the ratio of the free, unbound drug's area under the concentration-time curve ($AUC$) over a $24$-hour interval to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the target pathogen. This index is denoted as $fAUC/MIC$.\n\nThe given values are:\nThe free area under the concentration-time curve from time $0$ to $24$ hours, $fAUC_{0-24}$, is provided as:\n$$fAUC_{0-24} = 120\\,\\text{mg}\\cdot\\text{h}/\\text{L}$$\nThe minimum inhibitory concentration, $MIC$, for the pathogen is:\n$$MIC = 0.5\\,\\text{mg}/\\text{L}$$\n\nThe task is to compute the index $fAUC/MIC$.

The ratio therefore has units of time:\n$$\\frac{[\\text{mg}\\cdot\\text{h}/\\text{L}]}{[\\text{mg}/\\text{L}]} = [\\text{h}]$$\nHowever, the problem statement specifies that, by convention in this field, the index $fAUC/MIC$ is to be treated as a unitless quantity. We will adhere to this instruction.\n\nNow, we perform the numerical calculation:\n$$\\frac{fAUC}{MIC} = \\frac{120}{0.5}$$\nDividing by $0.5$ is equivalent to multiplying by $2$:\n$$\\frac{fAUC}{MIC} = 120 \\times 2 = 240$$\nThus, the value of the index is $240$.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires an assessment of whether this value meets the target for bactericidal activity.

Therefore, the calculated $fAUC/MIC$ index of $240$ exceeds the established bactericidal target of $100$. This suggests that the current dosing regimen is likely to be effective in eradicating the pathogen.\n\nThe problem asks for the single numerical value of the index to be reported as the final answer.\nThe computed value is $240$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{240}$$", "id": "4982292"}, {"introduction": "In contrast to concentration-dependent agents, the efficacy of time-dependent antibiotics, like many beta-lactams, is driven by the duration the drug concentration remains above the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC).
