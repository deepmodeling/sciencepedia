We are instructed to derive the solution from the foundational principles of Michaelis–Menten kinetics and competitive inhibition, without using pre-derived formulas.\n\nLet the enzyme be $E$, the substrate (PABA) be $S$, and the competitive inhibitor (SMX) be $I$. The product is $P$. The reaction scheme for classical competitive inhibition is as follows:\nThe enzyme can reversibly bind to the substrate to form an enzyme-substrate complex, $ES$, which can then proceed to form the product.\n$$E + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_2}{\\rightarrow} E + P$$\nThe competitive inhibitor binds reversibly to the free enzyme, $E$, at the same active site as the substrate, forming an enzyme-inhibitor complex, $EI$. The inhibitor does not bind to the $ES$ complex.\n$$E + I \\underset{k_{-3}}{\\stackrel{k_3}{\\rightleftharpoons}} EI$$\nThe total enzyme concentration, $[E]_T$, is the sum of the concentrations of the free enzyme, the enzyme-substrate complex, and the enzyme-inhibitor complex:\n$$[E]_T = [E] + [ES] + [EI]$$\nThe initial reaction velocity, $v$, is determined by the rate of product formation, which is proportional to the concentration of the $ES$ complex:\n$$v = k_2 [ES]$$\nThe maximal velocity, $V_{\\max}$, is achieved when the enzyme is saturated with the substrate, i.e., when $[ES] = [E]_T$.
