{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "For an oral drug to exert its effect, it must first be absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract into the bloodstream. This process is profoundly influenced by both the drug's chemical properties and the physiological environment of the GI tract. This exercise [@problem_id:4993257] delves into the pH-partition hypothesis, a cornerstone of pharmacokinetics, challenging you to calculate how the varying pH of the stomach and small intestine alters the ionization state of doxycycline. By understanding how a drug's charge changes with pH, you can predict where it will be most effectively absorbed, a critical skill for optimizing drug therapy.", "problem": "A pharmacology student is analyzing the pH-dependent membrane permeability of doxycycline to understand where in the gastrointestinal tract passive absorption is favored. To focus on acid–base control of membrane permeability, assume the following:\n\n- Treat doxycycline as a monoprotic weak base whose conjugate acid has an apparent acid dissociation constant expressed as $pK_a$ of $9.4$ (for the protonated dimethylamino group).\n- The stomach lumen has a pH of $1.5$, and the small intestinal lumen has $pH$ $6.5$.\n- At any given $pH$, the fraction of drug molecules in the unionized base form is the species that most readily partitions into lipid membranes, and instantaneous absorption efficiency is proportional to this unionized fraction, all else being equal.\n\nStarting from the Henderson–Hasselbalch relation for a weak base and the definition of the fraction of unionized base, derive the unionized fraction of doxycycline in the small intestine and in the stomach. Then, using the assumption that absorption efficiency is proportional to the unionized fraction and neglecting other factors (such as surface area, transit time, and complexation), compute the ratio of expected absorption efficiencies in the small intestine relative to the stomach.\n\nExpress the final small intestine-to-stomach absorption efficiency ratio as a dimensionless number and round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires us to calculate the ratio of absorption efficiencies of doxycycline in the small intestine versus the stomach. We are told to treat doxycycline as a monoprotic weak base, which we will denote as $B$. In an aqueous solution, it exists in equilibrium with its protonated conjugate acid form, $BH^+$. The relevant chemical equilibrium is the dissociation of the conjugate acid:\n$$BH^+ \\rightleftharpoons B + H^+$$\nThe acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, for this equilibrium is given by:\n$$K_a = \\frac{[B][H^+]}{[BH^+]}$$\nThe problem provides the $pK_a$ for this dissociation, where $pK_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$. The given value is $pK_a = 9.4$.\n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates $pH$, $pK_a$, and the ratio of the concentrations of the base and its conjugate acid:\n$$pH = pK_a + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B]}{[BH^+]}\\right)$$\nThe problem states that absorption efficiency is proportional to the fraction of the drug in its unionized base form, $B$. Let's denote this fraction as $f_B$. The total concentration of the drug, $[C_{total}]$, is the sum of the concentrations of the unionized and ionized forms:\n$$[C_{total}] = [B] + [BH^+]$$\nThe fraction of unionized base is therefore:\n$$f_B = \\frac{[B]}{[C_{total}]} = \\frac{[B]}{[B] + [BH^+]}$$\nTo express $f_B$ in terms of $pH$ and $pK_a$, we first rearrange the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to solve for the ratio $[BH^+]/[B]$:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B]}{[BH^+]}\\right) = pH - pK_a$$\n$$\\frac{[BH^+]}{[B]} = 10^{-(pH - pK_a)} = 10^{pK_a - pH}$$\nNow, we can write $[BH^+]$ in terms of $[B]$:\n$$[BH^+] = [B] \\cdot 10^{pK_a - pH}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $f_B$:\n$$f_B = \\frac{[B]}{[B] + [B] \\cdot 10^{pK_a - pH}}$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $[B]$ yields the general formula for the fraction of a weak base in its unionized form:\n$$f_B = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pK_a - pH}}$$\nThe problem states that absorption efficiency, $E$, is proportional to $f_B$, so we can write $E = k \\cdot f_B$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality. We are asked to find the ratio of the expected absorption efficiency in the small intestine ($E_{intestine}$) to that in the stomach ($E_{stomach}$).\n$$Ratio = \\frac{E_{intestine}}{E_{stomach}} = \\frac{k \\cdot (f_B)_{intestine}}{k \\cdot (f_B)_{stomach}} = \\frac{(f_B)_{intestine}}{(f_B)_{stomach}}$$\nWe are given the following values:\n$pK_a = 9.4$\n$pH_{stomach} = 1.5$\n$pH_{intestine} = 6.5$\n\nFirst, we calculate the fraction of unionized base in the small intestine:\n$$(f_B)_{intestine} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pK_a - pH_{intestine}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{9.4 - 6.5}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{2.9}}$$\nNext, we calculate the fraction of unionized base in the stomach:\n$$(f_B)_{stomach} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pK_a - pH_{stomach}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{9.4 - 1.5}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{7.9}}$$\nNow, we can compute the ratio:\n$$Ratio = \\frac{\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{2.9}}}{\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{7.9}}} = \\frac{1 + 10^{7.9}}{1 + 10^{2.9}}$$\nWe proceed with the numerical calculation:\n$$10^{2.9} \\approx 794.328$$\n$$10^{7.9} \\approx 79,432,823.47$$\nSubstituting these values into the ratio expression:\n$$Ratio = \\frac{1 + 79,432,823.47}{1 + 794.328} = \\frac{79,432,824.47}{795.328}$$\n$$Ratio \\approx 99874.29$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$Ratio \\approx 99900$$\nExpressing this in scientific notation:\n$$Ratio \\approx 9.99 \\times 10^4$$\nThis result indicates that, based solely on the pH-partition principle, the passive absorption of doxycycline is expected to be almost $100,000$ times more efficient in the small intestine than in the stomach. This is because the highly acidic environment of the stomach ($pH = 1.5$) keeps the weak base almost entirely in its protonated, charged ($BH^+$) form, which is poorly membrane-permeable. The less acidic environment of the small intestine ($pH = 6.5$), while still acidic relative to the drug's $pK_a$, allows for a significantly larger fraction of the drug to exist in its uncharged, membrane-permeable ($B$) form.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9.99 \\times 10^4}$$", "id": "4993257"}, {"introduction": "Ensuring a drug is absorbed is only half the battle; we must also administer a dose that achieves a concentration in the body sufficient to combat the infection, without causing unnecessary toxicity.

The key findings are: glucosuria with normal serum glucose, generalized aminoaciduria, phosphaturia (high fractional excretion of phosphate), and a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis due to proximal (Type 2) renal tubular acidosis with significant bicarbonate wasting. The underlying cause is the ingestion of expired tetracycline, a well-documented toxicological phenomenon.\n\nThe pathophysiology involves the degradation of tetracycline during improper storage into toxic byproducts, specifically **anhydrotetracycline** and its C-4 epimer, **4-epianhydrotetracycline**. According to foundational fact (i), the PCT relies on mitochondrial ATP to power the basolateral sodium-potassium ATPase, which drives all sodium-coupled secondary active transport processes. The degradation products of tetracycline are known to accumulate in PCT cells and act as mitochondrial toxins, impairing ATP production.
