Clearance is the volume of plasma cleared of a drug per unit time and acts as the proportionality constant between the rate of drug elimination and its plasma concentration, $C(t)$. The rate of elimination at any time $t$ is given by:\n$$ \\text{Rate of Elimination}(t) = CL \\times C(t) $$\n\nTo find the total amount of drug eliminated over a $24$-hour period, we must integrate this rate over the time interval from $t=0$ to $t=24$ hours.

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of pharmacokinetics and clinical pharmacology, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed in objective, formalizable language. All necessary parameters for the calculation are provided, and the required tasks are clearly defined.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part response: first, a mechanistic explanation of how renal impairment affects vancomycin clearance; second, a derivation of the relationship between maintenance dose, clearance, and Area Under the Curve (AUC); and third, the calculation of the appropriate daily maintenance dose for the specified patient.\n\nFirst, we will elaborate on the mechanism. Vancomycin is a large glycopeptide antibiotic that is primarily eliminated from the body by the kidneys. The process of renal elimination can be simplified into three components: glomerular filtration, active tubular secretion, and tubular reabsorption. The problem states that for vancomycin, elimination is primarily by glomerular filtration, with negligible active secretion or reabsorption. Only the fraction of the drug that is not bound to plasma proteins, such as albumin, is small enough to pass through the glomerular filtration barrier. This is known as the unbound fraction, denoted as $f_u$. The rate of filtration is therefore dependent on the glomerular filtration rate ($GFR$) and the concentration of unbound drug in the plasma ($C_u$). The total renal clearance ($CL_R$) via filtration is given by the relationship $CL_R = f_u \\times GFR$. The problem further simplifies the total systemic clearance ($CL_{sys}$) to be approximately equal to this renal clearance, so $CL_{sys} \\approx f_u \\times GFR$. Renal impairment is characterized by a reduced $GFR$. As evident from the equation, $CL_{sys}$ is directly proportional to $GFR$. Consequently, a decrease in $GFR$ leads to a proportional decrease in vancomycin clearance. This reduced clearance means the drug is eliminated more slowly, its half-life ($t_{1/2}$) increases, and without dose adjustment, the drug will accumulate to potentially toxic concentrations in the body.\n\nNext, we derive the relationship connecting the maintenance dose, clearance, and AUC at steady state. At steady state, the rate of drug administration is equal to the rate of drug elimination.\nLet $D$ be the maintenance dose administered over a dosing interval $\\tau$. The average rate of drug administration is $\\frac{D}{\\tau}$, assuming a bioavailability of $F=1$ for intravenous administration.\nThe instantaneous rate of drug elimination from the body is the product of systemic clearance ($CL_{sys}$) and the plasma drug concentration at time $t$, $C(t)$. So, Rate of Elimination $= CL_{sys} \\times C(t)$.\nTo find the total amount of drug eliminated over one dosing interval $\\tau$, we integrate the rate of elimination from $t=0$ to $t=\\tau$:\n$$ \\text{Amount Eliminated}_{\\tau} = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} CL_{sys} \\times C(t) \\,dt $$\nSince $CL_{sys}$ is assumed to be constant for a given patient, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$ \\text{Amount Eliminated}_{\\tau} = CL_{sys} \\times \\int_{0}^{\\tau} C(t) \\,dt $$\nThe term $\\int_{0}^{\\tau} C(t) \\,dt$ is, by definition, the Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve over the dosing interval, denoted as $AUC_{\\tau}$.\nAt steady state, the amount of drug administered in one interval equals the amount eliminated in that same interval:\n$$ D = \\text{Amount Eliminated}_{\\tau} = CL_{sys} \\times AUC_{\\tau} $$\nThe problem asks for the total daily maintenance dose, which we will call $D_{daily}$, and provides a target for the AUC over a $24$-hour period, $AUC_{24}$. Therefore, the dosing interval $\\tau$ is $24$ hours. The relationship becomes:\n$$ D_{daily} = CL_{sys} \\times AUC_{24} $$\nThis is the fundamental equation for AUC-based dosing.\n\nFinally, we will compute the patient's required total daily maintenance dose.\nThe patient is a $62$-year-old female weighing $68$ kg with a serum creatinine ($SCr$) of $2.1$ mg/dL.\nThe first step is to estimate the patient's renal function by calculating the creatinine clearance ($CrCl$) using the Cockcroft–Gault equation for females:\n$$ CrCl = 0.85 \\times \\frac{(140 - \\text{Age in years}) \\times (\\text{Weight in kg})}{72 \\times (\\text{SCr in mg/dL})} $$\nSubstituting the patient's data:\n$$ CrCl = 0.85 \\times \\frac{(140 - 62) \\times 68}{72 \\times 2.1} = 0.85 \\times \\frac{78 \\times 68}{151.2} = \\frac{4508.4}{151.2} \\approx 29.8175\\,\\mathrm{mL/min} $$\nThe problem assumes that $GFR$ can be approximated by this $CrCl$ value. To use this in our dose calculation, we must convert the units from mL/min to L/h to match the units of the target $AUC_{24}$ ($\\mathrm{mg}\\cdot\\mathrm{h/L}$).\n$$ GFR \\approx 29.8175 \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{min}} \\times \\frac{60 \\text{ min}}{1 \\text{ h}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ L}}{1000 \\text{ mL}} \\approx 1.7890\\,\\mathrm{L/h} $$\nNext, we calculate the systemic clearance of vancomycin using the provided approximation, $CL_{sys} \\approx f_u \\times GFR$. The fraction unbound, $f_u$, is given as $0.55$.\n$$ CL_{sys} \\approx 0.55 \\times 1.7890\\,\\mathrm{L/h} \\approx 0.98397\\,\\mathrm{L/h} $$\nNow we can compute the total daily dose using the derived equation $D_{daily} = CL_{sys} \\times AUC_{24}$.
