The clinical goal is to achieve a peak serum concentration (maximum concentration) $C_{\\max} = 8$ mg/L measured at distribution equilibrium after the end of infusion.

This model is a standard and widely used simplification for calculating loading doses for drugs like aminoglycosides, which primarily distribute into the extracellular fluid. The provided values for volume of distribution ($0.25$ $\\text{L}/\\text{kg}$) and target concentration ($8$ $\\text{mg}/\\text{L}$) for gentamicin are clinically realistic. The problem is free of pseudoscience and is grounded in established pharmacological theory.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data ($W$, $C_{\\max}$, $V_{d}$) and definitions required to derive the formula and compute a unique numerical answer. The objective is clearly stated.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language common to pharmacology and medicine. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions, missing information, or logical flaws. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the loading dose, $D_{L}$, that achieves a target peak concentration, $C_{\\max}$, immediately following IV administration and distribution.\n\n1.  The volume of distribution, $V_{d}$, is given as a specific volume per unit of body weight. The total volume of distribution for the patient, which we will denote as $V_{d, \\text{total}}$, is calculated by multiplying the specific volume by the patient's weight $W$.\n    $$V_{d, \\text{total}} = V_{d} \\times W$$\n\n2.  The problem provides the definition of the volume of distribution as the ratio of the amount of drug in the body, $A$, to the concentration in the plasma, $C$, at distribution equilibrium.\n    $$V_{d, \\text{total}} = \\frac{A}{C}$$\n\n3.  The clinical goal is to achieve a peak concentration $C_{\\max}$ at distribution equilibrium. At this specific point in time, the concentration $C$ is equal to $C_{\\max}$, and the amount of drug in the body is $A$. The relationship is:\n    $$C_{\\max} = \\frac{A}{V_{d, \\text{total}}}$$\n\n4.  The problem states that for an IV dose, we can assume that the amount of drug in the body, $A$, immediately after administration and distribution is approximately equal to the administered loading dose, $D_{L}$. This is a key assumption based on the idea that distribution is rapid and elimination is negligible over this short period.\n    $$A \\approx D_{L}$$\n\n5.  By substituting $D_{L}$ for $A$ in the concentration equation, we can relate the loading dose directly to the target peak concentration.\n    $$C_{\\max} \\approx \\frac{D_{L}}{V_{d, \\text{total}}}$$\n\n6.  To find the expression for the loading dose, we rearrange the equation:\n    $$D_{L} \\approx C_{\\max} \\times V_{d, \\text{total}}$$\n\n7.  Finally, substituting the expression for $V_{d, \\text{total}}$ from step 1 gives the complete derived expression for the loading dose:\n    $$D_{L} \\approx C_{\\max} \\times V_{d} \\times W$$\n\n### Statement of Assumptions\nAs required by the problem, the derivation relies on the following key pharmacokinetic assumptions:\n1.  **Single-Compartment Model**: The drug is assumed to distribute instantaneously and uniformly throughout a single, well-mixed volume (the volume of distribution). This implies that the drug concentration is the same throughout this conceptual compartment once distribution is complete.\n2.  **Negligible Elimination During Distribution**: It is assumed that no significant amount of the drug is eliminated (by metabolism or excretion) from the body during the administration and immediate post-administration distribution phase. This allows the amount of drug in the body at peak concentration to be equated to the total dose administered. This assumption is most valid for a rapid IV bolus injection.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nThe derived expression is now used to compute the numerical value of the loading dose using the given parameters.\n\n-   $C_{\\max} = 8$ mg/L\n-   $V_{d} = 0.25$ L/kg\n-   $W = 70$ kg\n\n$$D_{L} = (8 \\text{ mg}/\\text{L}) \\times (0.25 \\text{ L}/\\text{kg}) \\times (70 \\text{ kg})$$\nThe units are consistent: $(\\text{mg}/\\text{L}) \\times (\\text{L}/\\text{kg}) \\times \\text{kg} = \\text{mg}$.\n\n$$D_{L} = (8 \\times 0.25 \\times 70) \\text{ mg}$$\n$$D_{L} = (2 \\times 70) \\text{ mg}$$\n$$D_{L} = 140 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The exact calculated value is $140$. To express this value unambiguously with three significant figures, it is written in scientific notation as $1.40 \\times 10^2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.40 \\times 10^{2}}$$", "id": "4620861"}, {"introduction": "While foundational models are useful, effective clinical practice requires us to tailor drug dosing to individual patient characteristics.

Adjusted Body Weight ($AdjBW$) Calculation**\n\nThe problem states that the dosing weight should account for a fraction $f=0.4$ of the excess body weight. The excess body weight ($EBW$) is the difference between the Total Body Weight ($TBW$) and the Ideal Body Weight ($IBW$).\n$$EBW = TBW - IBW$$\nThe Adjusted Body Weight ($AdjBW$) is formulated as the Ideal Body Weight plus the contributing portion of the excess weight:\n$$AdjBW = IBW + f \\times (TBW - IBW)$$\nGiven $TBW = 110$ kg and $f = 0.4$, we substitute the values:\n$$AdjBW = 65.93700... + 0.4 \\times (110 - 65.93700...)$$\n$$AdjBW = 65.93700... + 0.4 \\times (44.06299...)$$\n$$AdjBW = 65.93700... + 17.62519...$$\n$$AdjBW = 83.56220... \\text{ kg}$$\n\n**3. Tobramycin Dose Calculation**\n\nThe required single dose of tobramycin is $7$ mg/kg, based on the calculated $AdjBW$. Let the dose rate be $D_{rate} = 7$ mg/kg. The total dose, $D_{total}$, is:\n$$D_{total} = D_{rate} \\times AdjBW$$\n$$D_{total} = 7 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}} \\times 83.56220... \\text{ kg}$$\n$$D_{total} = 584.93543... \\text{ mg}$$\n\nFinally, the problem requires rounding the result to four significant figures. The calculated dose is $584.93543...$ mg. The first four significant figures are $5$, $8$, $4$, and $9$. The fifth significant figure is $3$, which is less than $5$.
