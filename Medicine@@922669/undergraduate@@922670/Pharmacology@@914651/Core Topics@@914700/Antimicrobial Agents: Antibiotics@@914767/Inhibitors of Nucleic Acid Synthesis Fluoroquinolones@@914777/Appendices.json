Ciprofloxacin is an ampholyte with one acidic carboxyl group and one basic piperazinyl nitrogen.

The problem states a permeability hierarchy where electrically neutral species are most permeable, followed by zwitterionic species, with charged cationic and anionic species being poorly permeable. In the context of the calculated macroscopic species (cationic, zwitterionic, anionic), the zwitterion is the most permeable as it has a net charge of zero. To maximize passive diffusion, the concentration of the zwitterionic species should be maximized.\nComparing the calculated mole fractions of the zwitterion at the three given $pH$ values:\n- At $pH = 6.0$, $f_{zwitterion} \\approx 0.442$.\n- At $pH = 7.4$, $f_{zwitterion} \\approx 0.909$.\n- At $pH = 8.5$, $f_{zwitterion} \\approx 0.612$.\nThe fraction of the zwitterionic species is highest at $pH = 7.4$. This is expected, as the maximum concentration of the intermediate species of a diprotic acid occurs at the isoelectric point, $pI$. Therefore, the greatest passive diffusion is expected at $pH = 7.4$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.000882 & 0.442 & 0.557 & 0.0456 & 0.909 & 0.0456 & 0.386 & 0.612 & 0.00244\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4958339"}, {"introduction": "The effectiveness of a fluoroquinolone hinges on its ability to bind to and inhibit bacterial enzymes like DNA gyrase.

It is based on established principles of pharmacology and microbiology, specifically the action of fluoroquinolone antibiotics and a common mechanism of bacterial resistance. The provided information is self-contained and sufficient for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two results: first, to derive the relationship between the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and the dissociation constant ($K_d$) based on the provided pharmacodynamic model; second, to calculate the fold increase in MIC for a mutant bacterium.\n\nLet us begin from first principles. The fractional occupancy, $f$, of the target protein (DNA gyrase) by the antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) is given by the law of mass action for a simple one-to-one binding equilibrium:\n$$f = \\frac{[A]}{[A] + K_d}$$\nwhere $[A]$ is the free concentration of the antibiotic and $K_d$ is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the antibiotic-target complex.\n\nThe Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) is defined as the specific antibiotic concentration, $[A]$, at which a fixed threshold fractional occupancy, $f^{\\ast}$, is achieved. By this definition, when $[A] = \\text{MIC}$, the fractional occupancy $f$ is exactly $f^{\\ast}$. Substituting these into the fractional occupancy equation gives:\n$$f^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\text{MIC}}{\\text{MIC} + K_d}$$\n\nTo derive the relationship between MIC and $K_d$, we rearrange this equation to solve for MIC.\nFirst, multiply both sides by $(\\text{MIC} + K_d)$:\n$$f^{\\ast} (\\text{MIC} + K_d) = \\text{MIC}$$\nDistribute $f^{\\ast}$ on the left-hand side:\n$$f^{\\ast} \\cdot \\text{MIC} + f^{\\ast} \\cdot K_d = \\text{MIC}$$\nTo isolate MIC, we gather all terms containing MIC on one side of the equation:\n$$f^{\\ast} \\cdot K_d = \\text{MIC} - f^{\\ast} \\cdot \\text{MIC}$$\nFactor out MIC on the right-hand side:\n$$f^{\\ast} \\cdot K_d = \\text{MIC} (1 - f^{\\ast})$$\nFinally, assuming $f^{\\ast} \\neq 1$, we can divide by $(1 - f^{\\ast})$ to solve for MIC:\n$$\\text{MIC} = K_d \\frac{f^{\\ast}}{1 - f^{\\ast}}$$\nThis equation represents the relationship between MIC and $K_d$ derived from the given model. It demonstrates that, for a constant threshold occupancy $f^{\\ast}$, the MIC is directly proportional to the dissociation constant $K_d$. The term $\\frac{f^{\\ast}}{1 - f^{\\ast}}$ is a constant of proportionality. A higher $K_d$ signifies weaker binding (lower affinity), thus requiring a higher concentration of the drug (a higher MIC) to achieve the same inhibitory effect.\n\nNow, we must determine the fold increase in MIC for a clinical isolate with a mutation. Let the parameters for the wild-type (sensitive) bacterium be denoted by $\\text{MIC}_{\\text{WT}}$ and $K_{d, \\text{WT}}$. Let the parameters for the mutant (resistant) bacterium be denoted by $\\text{MIC}_{\\text{Mut}}$ and $K_{d, \\text{Mut}}$.\n\nAccording to the derived relationship, the MIC for each strain is:\n$$\\text{MIC}_{\\text{WT}} = K_{d, \\text{WT}} \\frac{f^{\\ast}}{1 - f^{\\ast}}$$\n$$\\text{MIC}_{\\text{Mut}} = K_{d, \\text{Mut}} \\frac{f^{\\ast}}{1 - f^{\\ast}}$$\nThe problem states that the mutation does not alter the occupancy threshold $f^{\\ast}$ for inhibition.\n\nThe problem also states that the mutation increases the dissociation constant by a factor of $10$. This can be expressed as:\n$$K_{d, \\text{Mut}} = 10 \\cdot K_{d, \\text{WT}}$$\n\nThe fold increase in MIC is the ratio of the MIC of the mutant to the MIC of the wild-type:\n$$\\text{Fold Increase} = \\frac{\\text{MIC}_{\\text{Mut}}}{\\text{MIC}_{\\text{WT}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\text{MIC}_{\\text{Mut}}$ and $\\text{MIC}_{\\text{WT}}$:\n$$\\text{Fold Increase} = \\frac{K_{d, \\text{Mut}} \\frac{f^{\\ast}}{1 - f^{\\ast}}}{K_{d, \\text{WT}} \\frac{f^{\\ast}}{1 - f^{\\ast}}}$$\nThe constant term $\\frac{f^{\\ast}}{1 - f^{\\ast}}$ is non-zero (since $f^{\\ast}$ must be between $0$ and $1$) and appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out:\n$$\\text{Fold Increase} = \\frac{K_{d, \\text{Mut}}}{K_{d, \\text{WT}}}$$\nNow, we substitute the relationship between the mutant and wild-type dissociation constants:\n$$\\text{Fold Increase} = \\frac{10 \\cdot K_{d, \\text{WT}}}{K_{d, \\text{WT}}}$$\nThe term $K_{d, \\text{WT}}$ cancels out, yielding the final result:\n$$\\text{Fold Increase} = 10$$\nTherefore, the mutation results in a $10$-fold increase in the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration.
