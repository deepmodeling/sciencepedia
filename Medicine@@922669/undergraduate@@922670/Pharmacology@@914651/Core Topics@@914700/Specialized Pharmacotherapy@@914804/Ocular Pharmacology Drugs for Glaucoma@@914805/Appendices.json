Its validity is assessed based on scientific grounding, being well-posed, and objectivity. The problem is based on a simplified but standard model of aqueous humor dynamics, often associated with the Goldmann equation. The premises are scientifically sound, the parameters provided ($F$, $C$, $P_v$) are within physiologically realistic ranges for a patient with glaucoma, and the relationship between variables is clearly defined. The question seeks a unique, stable solution based on the provided data and conditions. Consequently, the problem is deemed valid, and a rigorous solution can be derived.\n\nThe fundamental principle at steady state is that the aqueous humor inflow rate, denoted by $F$, must equal the total aqueous humor outflow rate, which we denote as $O$.\n$$F = O$$\nThe problem defines the outflow rate as being proportional to the pressure gradient between the intraocular pressure ($IOP$) and the episcleral venous pressure ($P_v$). The constant of proportionality is the outflow facility, $C$. This gives the expression for outflow:\n$$O = C (IOP - P_v)$$\nBy equating inflow and outflow, we obtain the governing equation for steady-state intraocular pressure:\n$$F = C (IOP - P_v)$$\nThe baseline parameters for the patient are provided as:\n- Baseline inflow rate: $F_{baseline} = 2.5$ $\\mu$L/min\n- Outflow facility: $C = 0.25$ $\\mu$L/min/mmHg\n- Episcleral venous pressure: $P_{v} = 9$ mmHg\n\nA topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor is administered. This drug reduces the production of aqueous humor. The problem states that the treatment \"reduces aqueous inflow by a factor of $0.80$ relative to baseline\". This phrasing is interpreted to mean that the new inflow rate, $F_{new}$, is the result of multiplying the baseline rate by the factor $0.80$. This is consistent with both common scientific parlance and the known pharmacological effect of such drugs, which typically reduce aqueous humor formation to approximately $70\\%-80\\%$ of the initial rate. The outflow facility, $C$, and episcleral venous pressure, $P_v$, are stated to remain unchanged.\n\nFirst, we calculate the new inflow rate, $F_{new}$:\n$$F_{new} = F_{baseline} \\times 0.80$$\nSubstituting the value for $F_{baseline}$:\n$$F_{new} = 2.5 \\times 0.80 = 2.0$$\nThe units for $F_{new}$ are $\\mu$L/min.\n\nNext, we apply the steady-state equation to the post-treatment condition to determine the new intraocular pressure, which we will call $IOP_{new}$.\n$$F_{new} = C (IOP_{new} - P_v)$$\nThis equation can be algebraically rearranged to solve for $IOP_{new}$:\n$$IOP_{new} = \\frac{F_{new}}{C} + P_v$$\n\nWe now substitute the numerical values corresponding to the new steady state. The units of the variables are internally consistent (i.e., $\\mu$L/min for $F_{new}$, $\\mu$L/min/mmHg for $C$, and mmHg for $P_v$), which will yield a result for $IOP_{new}$ in mmHg.\n$$IOP_{new} = \\frac{2.0}{0.25} + 9$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\\frac{2.0}{0.25} = 8$$\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n$$IOP_{new} = 8 + 9 = 17$$\nThe new steady-state intraocular pressure is exactly $17$ mmHg.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

First, isolate the term containing $IOP$:\n$$F - U = C(IOP - P_v)$$\n\nNext, divide both sides by the outflow facility, $C$:\n$$\\frac{F - U}{C} = IOP - P_v$$\n\nFinally, add the episcleral venous pressure, $P_v$, to both sides to solve for $IOP$:\n$$IOP = \\frac{F - U}{C} + P_v$$\nThis is the desired analytic expression for intraocular pressure.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of $IOP$ Before and After Treatment**\n\nThe following constant parameters are given:\n- $F = 2.5 \\, \\frac{\\mu\\text{L}}{\\text{min}}$\n- $C = 0.3 \\, \\frac{\\mu\\text{L}}{\\text{min} \\cdot \\text{mmHg}}$\n- $P_v = 8 \\, \\text{mmHg}$\n\n**Before treatment:**\nThe uveoscleral outflow is $U_{\\text{before}} = 0.5 \\, \\frac{\\mu\\text{L}}{\\text{min}}$.\nUsing the derived formula, the intraocular pressure before treatment, $IOP_{\\text{before}}$, is:\n$$IOP_{\\text{before}} = \\frac{F - U_{\\text{before}}}{C} + P_v$$\n$$IOP_{\\text{before}} = \\frac{2.5 - 0.5}{0.3} + 8$$\n$$IOP_{\\text{before}} = \\frac{2.0}{0.3} + 8$$\n$$IOP_{\\text{before}} \\approx 6.666... + 8 = 14.666... \\, \\text{mmHg}$$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures, we get $IOP_{\\text{before}} = 14.7 \\, \\text{mmHg}$.\n\n**After treatment:**\nThe prostaglandin analog increases the uveoscleral outflow to $U_{\\text{after}} = 1.0 \\, \\frac{\\mu\\text{L}}{\\text{min}}$.
