The total concentration of receptors, $[\\mathrm{R}]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the concentration of free, unbound receptors, $[\\mathrm{R}]$, and the concentration of ligand-bound receptors, $[\\mathrm{RL}]$.\n$$[\\mathrm{R}]_{\\text{total}} = [\\mathrm{R}] + [\\mathrm{RL}]$$\nThe fractional occupancy is therefore:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[\\mathrm{RL}]}{[\\mathrm{R}]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{RL}]}{[\\mathrm{R}] + [\\mathrm{RL}]}$$\nThe problem provides the definition for the dissociation constant, $K_d$, at equilibrium:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[\\mathrm{R}][\\mathrm{L}]}{[\\mathrm{RL}]}$$\nwhere $[\\mathrm{L}]$ is the concentration of the free ligand. We can rearrange this expression to solve for the concentration of free receptors, $[\\mathrm{R}]$:\n$$[\\mathrm{R}] = \\frac{K_d [\\mathrm{RL}]}{[\\mathrm{L}]}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[\\mathrm{R}]$ into the equation for fractional occupancy $\\theta$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[\\mathrm{RL}]}{\\frac{K_d [\\mathrm{RL}]}{[\\mathrm{L}]} + [\\mathrm{RL}]}$$\nAssuming there is some ligand present, such that $[\\mathrm{RL}] > 0$, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by $[\\mathrm{RL}]$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[\\mathrm{L}]} + 1}$$\nTo simplify, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $[\\mathrm{L}]$, which yields the Hill-Langmuir equation:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[\\mathrm{L}]}{K_d + [\\mathrm{L}]}$$\nThe problem states to use the approximations $K_i \\approx K_d$ and $C_u^{\\text{brain}} \\approx [\\mathrm{L}]$. Substituting these into the derived equation gives the desired expression for occupancy in terms of the given parameters:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{C_u^{\\text{brain}}}{K_i + C_u^{\\text{brain}}}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the dopamine $\\mathrm{D}_2$ receptor occupancy.\n\n### Numerical Computation\nNext, we compute the occupancy using the given values: $C_u^{\\text{brain}} = 2$ nM and $K_i = 3$ nM.\n$$\\theta = \\frac{2 \\text{ nM}}{3 \\text{ nM} + 2 \\text{ nM}} = \\frac{2}{5}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$\\theta = 0.4$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\theta = 0.400$$\n\n### Conclusion on Efficacy Threshold\nFinally, we compare this computed occupancy to the commonly cited antipsychotic efficacy threshold of $65\\%$, which is $0.65$ in fractional terms.\n$$0.400 < 0.65$$\nThe calculated occupancy of $40.0\\%$ is less than the $65\\%$ threshold.

While two drugs might target the same receptor, they often do so with vastly different affinities. This practice builds upon the concept of receptor occupancy to address a practical question: how do we adjust the dose when switching between drugs to maintain the same therapeutic effect? By working through this problem, you will see how the inhibition constant ($K_i$) directly informs dose-equivalence calculations [@problem_id:4925458].", "problem": "A central tenet of the dopamine hypothesis of psychosis is that symptoms are modulated by signaling at dopamine $\\mathrm{D}_2$ receptors. Antipsychotic efficacy correlates with $\\mathrm{D}_2$ receptor occupancy, and many antipsychotic drugs act as competitive antagonists at $\\mathrm{D}_2$ receptors. Consider two antipsychotic agents, risperidone and quetiapine, each acting as a reversible, competitive antagonist at the dopamine $\\mathrm{D}_2$ receptor. The binding interaction between a ligand and a receptor is governed by the law of mass action under equilibrium conditions, and the fraction of receptors occupied depends on the free (unbound) ligand concentration in brain and the receptor–ligand affinity constant. The inhibition constant $K_i$ obtained from radioligand displacement experiments approximates the equilibrium dissociation constant $K_d$ for a competitive antagonist under these conditions.\n\nAssume the following:\n- The patient is stabilized at a fixed dopamine $\\mathrm{D}_2$ receptor occupancy on risperidone.\n- The free (unbound) brain concentration of each drug is linearly proportional to the administered dose with the same proportionality constant across drugs (i.e., equal brain penetration and unbound fraction), so the ratio of doses equals the ratio of free brain concentrations required to achieve a given occupancy.\n- Risperidone has $K_i = 3\\ \\mathrm{nM}$ at the dopamine $\\mathrm{D}_2$ receptor, and quetiapine has $K_i = 200\\ \\mathrm{nM}$ at the dopamine $\\mathrm{D}_2$ receptor.\n\nUsing only equilibrium receptor–ligand binding principles consistent with the law of mass action, determine the fold-dose increase required when switching from risperidone to quetiapine to maintain the same dopamine $\\mathrm{D}_2$ receptor occupancy. Express your answer as a unitless fold-change and round your result to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of receptor pharmacology, is well-posed, objective, and self-contained within the provided assumptions.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the interaction between a ligand and a receptor at equilibrium is the law of mass action. For a simple bimolecular interaction where one ligand molecule, $L$, binds to one receptor, $R$, to form a complex, $LR$, the fractional receptor occupancy, $O$, is described by the Hill-Langmuir equation:\n$$O = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_d}$$\nwhere $[L]$ is the free (unbound) concentration of the ligand and $K_d$ is the equilibrium dissociation constant. The problem states that for a competitive antagonist, the inhibition constant, $K_i$, can be used to approximate $K_d$. Thus, the equation for occupancy by an antagonist drug, $D$, is:\n$$O = \\frac{[D]}{[D] + K_i}$$\nHere, $[D]$ represents the free concentration of the antagonist drug in the brain.\n\nThe central condition of the problem is that the dopamine $\\mathrm{D}_2$ receptor occupancy must be maintained at the same level when switching from risperidone (RIS) to quetiapine (QTP). Let this constant target occupancy be denoted by $O_{target}$.\n\nFor risperidone, the relationship is:\n$$O_{target} = \\frac{[RIS]}{[RIS] + K_{i,RIS}}$$\nFor quetiapine, the relationship is:\n$$O_{target} = \\frac{[QTP]}{[QTP] + K_{i,QTP}}$$\nwhere $[RIS]$ and $[QTP]$ are the free brain concentrations of risperidone and quetiapine, respectively, and $K_{i,RIS}$ and $K_{i,QTP}$ are their respective inhibition constants at the $\\mathrm{D}_2$ receptor.\n\nTo find the relationship between the concentrations required to achieve this same occupancy, we can rearrange the general occupancy equation to solve for the drug concentration $[D]$:\n$$O \\cdot ([D] + K_i) = [D]$$\n$$O \\cdot [D] + O \\cdot K_i = [D]$$\n$$O \\cdot K_i = [D] - O \\cdot [D]$$\n$$O \\cdot K_i = [D](1 - O)$$\n$$[D] = \\frac{O \\cdot K_i}{1 - O}$$\n\nApplying this formula to both drugs to achieve the occupancy $O_{target}$:\nThe required free concentration of risperidone is:\n$$[RIS] = \\frac{O_{target} \\cdot K_{i,RIS}}{1 - O_{target}}$$\nThe required free concentration of quetiapine is:\n$$[QTP] = \\frac{O_{target} \\cdot K_{i,QTP}}{1 - O_{target}}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the fold-dose increase required when switching from risperidone to quetiapine. This is the ratio of the quetiapine dose, $Dose_{QTP}$, to the risperidone dose, $Dose_{RIS}$. The problem explicitly states that the ratio of doses is equal to the ratio of the free brain concentrations required to achieve the target occupancy:\n$$\\text{Fold-dose increase} = \\frac{Dose_{QTP}}{Dose_{RIS}} = \\frac{[QTP]}{[RIS]}$$\n\nWe can now find this ratio by dividing the expression for $[QTP]$ by the expression for $[RIS]$:\n$$\\frac{[QTP]}{[RIS]} = \\frac{\\frac{O_{target} \\cdot K_{i,QTP}}{1 - O_{target}}}{\\frac{O_{target} \\cdot K_{i,RIS}}{1 - O_{target}}}$$\nThe terms $O_{target}$ and $(1 - O_{target})$ are common to both the numerator and the denominator, so they cancel out, yielding a simple relationship:\n$$\\frac{[QTP]}{[RIS]} = \\frac{K_{i,QTP}}{K_{i,RIS}}$$\nThis result shows that to maintain a constant level of receptor occupancy, the ratio of the free concentrations of two competitive antagonists must be equal to the ratio of their inhibition constants. A drug with a higher $K_i$ (lower affinity) requires a proportionally higher concentration.\n\nThe given inhibition constants are:\n$K_{i,RIS} = 3\\ \\mathrm{nM}$\n$K_{i,QTP} = 200\\ \\mathrm{nM}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation for the fold-dose increase:\n$$\\text{Fold-dose increase} = \\frac{K_{i,QTP}}{K_{i,RIS}} = \\frac{200}{3}$$\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\\frac{200}{3} \\approx 66.666...$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested gives $66.7$.\nTherefore, a $66.7$-fold increase in dose is required when switching from risperidone to quetiapine to maintain the same level of dopamine $\\mathrm{D}_2$ receptor occupancy, under the specified assumptions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{66.7}$$", "id": "4925458"}, {"introduction": "Achieving the target receptor occupancy depends not only on a drug's properties but also on how an individual patient's body handles the drug—a field known as pharmacokinetics.
