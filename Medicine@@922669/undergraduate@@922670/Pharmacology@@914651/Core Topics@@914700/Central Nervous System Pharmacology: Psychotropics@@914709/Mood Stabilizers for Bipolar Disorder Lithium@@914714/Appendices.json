The task is to calculate the molar amount of elemental lithium in a specified mass of lithium carbonate, which is a standard and practical calculation in a clinical or pharmaceutical setting.\n\nThe first step is to determine the chemical formula for lithium carbonate. The lithium ion is $\\mathrm{Li}^{+}$, carrying a charge of $+1$. The carbonate polyatomic ion is $\\mathrm{CO}_3^{2-}$, carrying a charge of $-2$. To achieve charge neutrality in the ionic compound, two lithium ions are required for every one carbonate ion.

The provided values for lithium concentrations are clinically realistic.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides sufficient information and clear assumptions (linear kinetics, constant clearance) to establish a direct relationship between dose and concentration, allowing for a unique and stable solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective clinical and pharmacological terms.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It contains no invalidating flaws. Therefore, it is deemed **valid**. The solution will proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe fundamental principle for a drug at steady state ($ss$) with first-order elimination is that the rate of drug administration is equal to the rate of drug elimination. The average steady-state plasma concentration ($C_{ss, avg}$) is given by:\n$$C_{ss, avg} = \\frac{F \\times D}{CL \\times \\tau}$$\nwhere $F$ is the bioavailability, $D$ is the dose administered per dosing interval $\\tau$, and $CL$ is the total body clearance. The term $D/\\tau$ represents the average dosing rate. For a total daily dose, which we will also denote by $D$, the relationship simplifies conceptually to the average concentration being proportional to the total daily dosing rate.\n\nFor a drug exhibiting linear pharmacokinetics, all concentrations at steady state (e.g., peak, trough, average) are directly proportional to the dosing rate, provided the dosing interval and other kinetic parameters remain constant. Therefore, we can state that the steady-state trough concentration ($C_{ss, trough}$) is proportional to the total daily dose ($D$):\n$$C_{ss, trough} \\propto D$$\nThis can be written as an equality using a proportionality constant, $K$:\n$$C_{ss, trough} = K \\times D$$\nThe constant $K$ encapsulates the patient-specific pharmacokinetic parameters that are assumed to be constant for the dose adjustment, including bioavailability ($F$), clearance ($CL$), volume of distribution, and elimination rate constant, as well as the dosing schedule.\n\nWe are given two states: the current state and the target state.\nFor the current state:\n$$C_{ss, trough, current} = K \\times D_{current}$$\nFor the target state:\n$$C_{ss, trough, target} = K \\times D_{target}$$\n\nTo derive the algorithm for the new dose ($D_{target}$), we can form a ratio of the two equations. This is a robust method as it eliminates the unknown constant $K$:\n$$\\frac{C_{ss, trough, target}}{C_{ss, trough, current}} = \\frac{K \\times D_{target}}{K \\times D_{current}} = \\frac{D_{target}}{D_{current}}$$\nSolving for $D_{target}$, we arrive at the dose-adjustment algorithm:\n$$D_{target} = D_{current} \\times \\left( \\frac{C_{ss, trough, target}}{C_{ss, trough, current}} \\right)$$\nThis equation is the formal algorithm for dose adjustment based on the principle of dose proportionality in linear pharmacokinetics.\n\nNext, we apply this algorithm to the patient's data.\n- $D_{current} = 900 \\text{ mg/day}$\n- $C_{ss, trough, current} = 0.50 \\text{ mmol/L}$\n- $C_{ss, trough, target} = 0.80 \\text{ mmol/L}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$D_{target} = 900 \\text{ mg/day} \\times \\left( \\frac{0.80 \\text{ mmol/L}}{0.50 \\text{ mmol/L}} \\right)$$\n$$D_{target} = 900 \\times \\frac{8}{5} = 900 \\times 1.6$$\n$$D_{target} = 1440 \\text{ mg/day}$$\nThe problem requires rounding the computed new dose to three significant figures. The calculated value $1440$ has three significant figures ($1$, $4$, and $4$), so no further rounding is necessary. The new total daily dose of lithium carbonate should be $1440 \\text{ mg/day}$.\n\n### Conditions Invalidating the Assumption of Constant Clearance\n\nThe validity of the simple proportional calculation hinges on the assumption that lithium clearance ($CL$) remains constant. Since lithium is almost exclusively eliminated by the kidneys, any factor altering renal function will change its clearance. This breaks the linear proportionality between dose and concentration. Key conditions under which this assumption fails include:\n\n1.  **Changes in Renal Function:** Any decline in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), such as in acute kidney injury (AKI) or progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), will decrease lithium clearance and can lead to toxic accumulation at a previously stable dose. Conversely, an improvement in renal function would increase clearance.\n\n2.  **Changes in Sodium and Water Balance:** Lithium ($Li^+$) is a monovalent cation that is handled by the renal tubules in a manner similar to sodium ($Na^+$).\n    - **Volume Depletion (Dehydration):** In states of dehydration, the kidneys increase proximal tubule reabsorption of sodium to conserve volume. This process also leads to increased reabsorption of lithium, thereby decreasing its clearance and raising serum levels.\n    - **Dietary Sodium Changes:** A significant decrease in dietary sodium intake can trigger the same renal compensatory mechanism, leading to reduced lithium clearance. Conversely, a large increase in sodium intake may increase lithium excretion.\n\n3.  **Pharmacologic Interactions (Drug-Drug Interactions):** Several classes of medications can alter lithium clearance:\n    - **Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs):** Drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen can reduce renal blood flow and GFR by inhibiting the synthesis of renal prostaglandins, leading to a decrease in lithium clearance.\n    - **Thiazide Diuretics:** Drugs such as hydrochlorothiazide induce a mild state of volume depletion, which enhances proximal tubule reabsorption of both sodium and lithium, significantly reducing lithium clearance.\n    - **ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs):** Medications like lisinopril and losartan can reduce GFR and may also alter tubular handling of lithium, resulting in decreased clearance.\n\nIn any of these situations, the direct proportionality $C_{ss, trough} \\propto D$ would no longer hold, and the calculated dose adjustment would be inaccurate, potentially leading to subtherapeutic levels or toxicity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1440}$$", "id": "4964245"}]}
