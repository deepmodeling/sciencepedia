The problem is self-contained, scientifically grounded in the principles of receptor pharmacology, and provides all necessary data for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, from first principles. Consider a simple, reversible binding interaction between a ligand, $L$, and a receptor, $R$, to form a ligand-receptor complex, $RL$:\n$$R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$$\nThis reaction is governed by the forward (association) rate constant, $k_{on}$, and the reverse (dissociation) rate constant, $k_{off}$.

The most occupied off-target is the H1 receptor. Antagonism (blockade) of central H1 receptors is pharmacologically well-established to cause sedation/somnolence and contribute to weight gain. Blockade of M1 receptors causes anticholinergic effects (e.g., dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision), and blockade of $\\alpha_1$ receptors causes orthostatic hypotension. Given that the occupancy of the H1 receptor ($\\approx 71.4\\,\\%$) is the highest among the off-targets, the side effect profile of imipramine at this concentration would be dominated by H1-mediated effects, most notably sedation.\n\nIn contrast, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) is designed to have high selectivity for SERT, with negligible affinity for H1, M1, and $\\alpha_1$ receptors. Consequently, SSRIs do not typically cause the triad of side effects associated with TCAs (sedation, anticholinergic effects, orthostatic hypotension). Therefore, relative to an SSRI, the dominant side effect domain for imipramine, based on these calculations, would be H1-mediated effects such as sedation.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum fractional occupancy across the listed off-target receptors, rounded to four significant figures.
