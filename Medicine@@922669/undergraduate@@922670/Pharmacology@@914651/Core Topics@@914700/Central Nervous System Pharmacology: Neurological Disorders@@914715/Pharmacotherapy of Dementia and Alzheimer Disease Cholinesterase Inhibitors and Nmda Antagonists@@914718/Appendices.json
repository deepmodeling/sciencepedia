The problem requires a quantitative application of established principles, not a trivial calculation or a subjective interpretation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe total body clearance ($CL_T$) is the sum of renal clearance ($CL_R$) and nonrenal clearance ($CL_{NR}$). We denote baseline conditions with the subscript $0$ and conditions with renal impairment with the subscript $1$.\n\nAt baseline, the total clearance is:\n$$CL_{T,0} = CL_{R,0} + CL_{NR,0}$$\n\nWe are given that the renal component contributes a fraction $f_R = 0.8$ to the total clearance at baseline.\n$$f_{R} = \\frac{CL_{R,0}}{CL_{T,0}} = 0.8$$\nThis implies that the fraction contributed by the nonrenal component is:\n$$f_{NR} = \\frac{CL_{NR,0}}{CL_{T,0}} = 1 - f_{R} = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$$\n\nFrom these relationships, we can express the baseline clearance components in terms of the baseline total clearance:\n$$CL_{R,0} = f_{R} \\cdot CL_{T,0} = 0.8 \\cdot CL_{T,0}$$\n$$CL_{NR,0} = f_{NR} \\cdot CL_{T,0} = 0.2 \\cdot CL_{T,0}$$\n\nThe patient develops renal impairment, causing creatinine clearance ($CrCl$) to be reduced by $50\\%$. The new creatinine clearance, $CrCl_1$, is therefore:\n$$CrCl_1 = (1 - 0.5) \\cdot CrCl_0 = 0.5 \\cdot CrCl_0$$\n\nWe are given that memantine's renal clearance, $CL_R$, scales linearly with $CrCl$. The new renal clearance, $CL_{R,1}$, can be calculated as:\n$$CL_{R,1} = CL_{R,0} \\cdot \\frac{CrCl_1}{CrCl_0} = CL_{R,0} \\cdot 0.5$$\n\nThe nonrenal clearance is stated to be unchanged:\n$$CL_{NR,1} = CL_{NR,0}$$\n\nThe new total clearance, $CL_{T,1}$, is the sum of the new renal and nonrenal components:\n$$CL_{T,1} = CL_{R,1} + CL_{NR,1}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $CL_{R,1}$ and $CL_{NR,1}$:\n$$CL_{T,1} = (0.5 \\cdot CL_{R,0}) + CL_{NR,0}$$\n\nTo determine the change in total clearance relative to baseline, we substitute the expressions for $CL_{R,0}$ and $CL_{NR,0}$ in terms of $CL_{T,0}$:\n$$CL_{T,1} = 0.5 \\cdot (0.8 \\cdot CL_{T,0}) + (0.2 \\cdot CL_{T,0})$$\n$$CL_{T,1} = (0.4 \\cdot CL_{T,0}) + (0.2 \\cdot CL_{T,0})$$\n$$CL_{T,1} = (0.4 + 0.2) \\cdot CL_{T,0} = 0.6 \\cdot CL_{T,0}$$\nThis shows that the new total clearance is $60\\%$ of the baseline total clearance.\n\nThe problem requires adjusting the daily dose to maintain the same steady-state exposure. For a drug exhibiting linear pharmacokinetics, this is equivalent to maintaining the same average steady-state concentration ($C_{ss,avg}$). The formula for $C_{ss,avg}$ is:\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{\\text{Dosing Rate}}{CL_T}$$\nThe dosing rate is the total daily dose, as bioavailability ($F$) and the dosing interval ($\\tau$) are constant. Let $D_{daily,0}$ and $D_{daily,1}$ be the baseline and adjusted daily doses, respectively. To maintain the same exposure ($C_{ss,avg,1} = C_{ss,avg,0}$):\n$$\\frac{D_{daily,1}}{CL_{T,1}} = \\frac{D_{daily,0}}{CL_{T,0}}$$\n\nWe can solve for the adjusted daily dose, $D_{daily,1}$:\n$$D_{daily,1} = D_{daily,0} \\cdot \\frac{CL_{T,1}}{CL_{T,0}}$$\n\nWe have already derived the ratio of the clearances: $\\frac{CL_{T,1}}{CL_{T,0}} = 0.6$. The baseline daily dose is $D_{daily,0} = 20 \\text{ mg/day}$.\n$$D_{daily,1} = (20 \\text{ mg/day}) \\cdot 0.6$$\n$$D_{daily,1} = 12 \\text{ mg/day}$$\n\nThe question asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

By setting $N = NNT$ and $\\Delta E = 1$, we can write:\n$$1 = NNT \\times (P_T - P_P)$$\n\nSolving for $NNT$, we arrive at the standard formula:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{P_T - P_P} = \\frac{1}{ABI}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this formula:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.25 - 0.15}$$\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.10}$$\n$$NNT = 10$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures.

The result of their subtraction, $0.10$, is precise to the hundredths place and thus has two significant figures ($1$ and the trailing $0$). The numerator in the NNT calculation, $1$, is an exact number by definition. According to the rules of significant figures in calculations, the result of a division should be reported with the same number of significant figures as the measurement with the fewest significant figures.
