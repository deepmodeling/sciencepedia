The transport of levodopa by LAT1 and its competitive inhibition by large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) from dietary protein is a clinically significant and well-documented phenomenon. The application of the Michaelis-Menten model to describe carrier-mediated transport and competitive inhibition is a standard and fundamental concept in these fields.

Proceeding with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe transport of levodopa ($L$) by LAT1 is described by the Michaelis-Menten equation, where the flux ($J$) is a function of the substrate concentration $[L]$:\n\n$$ J = \\frac{J_{\\max} [L]}{K_m + [L]} $$\n\n**1.

Analyze the effect of the competitive inhibitor (leucine):**\nThe problem states that leucine ($I$) is a purely competitive inhibitor. In competitive inhibition, the inhibitor binds to the same active site as the substrate. This has two key consequences for the kinetic parameters:\n-   The maximum flux, $J_{\\max}$, is **unchanged**. The inhibition can be overcome by a sufficiently high substrate concentration.\n-   The apparent Michaelis constant, $K_{m,app}$, **increases**. The substrate appears to have a lower affinity for the transporter because it must compete with the inhibitor.\n\nThe formula for the apparent Michaelis constant in the presence of a competitive inhibitor is:\n\n$$ K_{m,app} = K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) $$\n\nUsing the given parameters: $K_m = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $[I] = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, and $K_i = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n\n$$ K_{m,app} = (100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) \\left(1 + \\frac{100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}\\right) = (100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) \\cdot (1 + 1) = 200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} $$\n\nSo, in the presence of the high-protein meal, the apparent $K_m$ increases to $200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, while $J_{\\max}$ remains $2.0\\,\\mathrm{nmol}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$.\n\n**3.
