For methylphenidate, a cornerstone of ADHD therapy, the primary target is the dopamine transporter (DAT). This first practice invites you to apply the law of mass action to a real-world scenario, calculating the fraction of transporters occupied by the drug at a given concentration [@problem_id:4935063]. Understanding this relationship between drug concentration in the brain ($C$), its binding affinity for the target ($K_{i}$), and the resulting target occupancy is the first step in linking a drug dose to its clinical effect.", "problem": "A central nervous system (CNS) stimulant used in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) therapy, methylphenidate, exerts its primary pharmacodynamic effect by competitively binding to the dopamine transporter (DAT), thereby inhibiting dopamine reuptake. Consider a single-site, reversible binding interaction between the dopamine transporter and methylphenidate at equilibrium, governed by the law of mass action. The fraction of transporter sites occupied by a ligand depends on the free ligand concentration in the biophase and the affinity of the ligand for the site. For competitive inhibitors measured under tracer conditions, the inhibition constant $K_{i}$ can be used to approximate the dissociation constant for binding.\n\nAssume the following scientifically plausible parameters:\n- The dopamine transporter (DAT) has an inhibition constant $K_{i} = 160$ nM for methylphenidate, measured under equilibrium competitive binding conditions.\n- The free brain (biophase) concentration of methylphenidate at steady state is $C = 40$ nM.\n\nStarting from the fundamental law of mass action for reversible binding and the definition of the dissociation constant, derive the fractional occupancy expression appropriate for a single binding site in terms of the free inhibitor concentration and $K_{i}$. Then compute the dopamine transporter occupancy produced by methylphenidate under these conditions. Round your final numerical result to three significant figures and express the occupancy as a decimal fraction with no unit. Briefly interpret in words, based on your derived framework, whether the computed occupancy is likely to correspond to robust clinical efficacy for ADHD symptoms relative to typical effective occupancy ranges reported for dopamine transporter blockade, but ensure that only the occupancy value is reported as the final numerical answer.", "solution": "The mechanism is competitive, reversible binding of methylphenidate to the dopamine transporter. Let the transporter be denoted by $T$, the inhibitor (methylphenidate) by $I$, and the complex by $TI$. The reversible binding reaction is:\n$$\nT + I \\rightleftharpoons TI.\n$$\nAt thermodynamic equilibrium, the law of mass action defines the dissociation constant $K_{d}$ as:\n$$\nK_{d} = \\frac{[T][I]}{[TI]},\n$$\nwhere $[T]$ is the concentration of unbound transporter, $[I]$ is the free inhibitor concentration in the biophase, and $[TI]$ is the concentration of the transporter–inhibitor complex. The fractional occupancy $\\theta$ is defined as the fraction of total transporter sites occupied by the inhibitor:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[TI]}{[T] + [TI]}.\n$$\nWe eliminate $[TI]$ and $[T]$ using the definition of $K_{d}$.

Therefore, replacing $K_{d}$ with $K_{i}$ and writing the free inhibitor concentration in the biophase as $C$, the fractional occupancy is:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{C}{C + K_{i}}.\n$$\nWe are given $C = 40 \\text{ nM}$ and $K_{i} = 160 \\text{ nM}$.

Clinical imaging and pharmacodynamic studies commonly associate more robust ADHD symptom control with substantially higher dopamine transporter occupancy (often on the order of about one-half or greater under effective dosing).

The pharmacokinetics are described by a one-compartment model with first-order elimination.\n\nFirst, we establish the mathematical description of drug concentration over time. For a one-compartment model with first-order elimination, the concentration $C(t)$ following a single intravenous bolus dose decreases exponentially according to the equation:\n$$C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-kt)$$\nwhere $C_0$ is the initial concentration at time $t=0$, and $k$ is the first-order elimination rate constant.
