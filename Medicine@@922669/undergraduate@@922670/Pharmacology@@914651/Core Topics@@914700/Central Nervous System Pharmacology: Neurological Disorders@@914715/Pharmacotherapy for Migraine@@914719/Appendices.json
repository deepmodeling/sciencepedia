This is known as the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) or Absolute Benefit Increase.\n$$ARR = P_{\\text{active}} - P_{\\text{placebo}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ARR = 0.25 - 0.10 = 0.15$$\n\nThe problem defines the expected number of additional responders, let's call it $E$, when treating $n$ patients as:\n$$E = (P_{\\text{active}} - P_{\\text{placebo}}) \\times n = ARR \\times n$$\n\nThe NNT is defined as the number of patients $n$ that need to be treated for the expected number of additional responders to be equal to $1$. We set $E=1$ and solve for $n$, which will be our NNT.\n$$1 = ARR \\times \\text{NNT}$$\nSolving for NNT, we get the standard formula:\n$$\\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\n\nUsing the calculated value of $ARR$:\n$$\\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{0.15}$$\nTo perform the calculation:\n$$\\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{15}{100}} = \\frac{100}{15} = \\frac{20}{3}$$\nAs a decimal, this is:\n$$\\text{NNT} = 6.666\\overline{6}$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures.\nThe first three significant figures are $6$, $6$, and $6$. The fourth figure is a $6$, which requires rounding up the third figure.\n$$\\text{NNT} \\approx 6.67$$\n\nClinically, an NNT of $6.67$ signifies that, on average, for approximately every $7$ patients treated with the active therapy for an acute migraine attack, one additional patient achieves pain freedom at two hours who would not have achieved it if they had been given a placebo.

Excessive vasoconstriction increases cardiovascular risk, which grows with higher peak and cumulative receptor activation. From pharmacokinetics, oral sumatriptan exhibits first-order elimination with half-life $t_{1/2} \\approx 2 \\text{ h}$. For a drug obeying first-order elimination, plasma concentration $C(t)$ after an instantaneous input is given by\n$$\nC(t) = C_0 e^{-k t}, \\quad k = \\frac{\\ln 2}{t_{1/2}}.\n$$\nWith $t_{1/2} \\approx 2\\ \\text{h}$, we have $k \\approx \\frac{\\ln 2}{2}\\ \\text{h}^{-1} \\approx 0.3466\\ \\text{h}^{-1}$.

Redosing at or after $2$ hours adds to a lower residual concentration (approximately $50\\%$), lessening the additive vasoconstrictive effect while maintaining efficacy because the initial effect often wanes by that time for many patients. Clinical labeling aligns with this pharmacokinetic reasoning: a repeat dose may be taken after $\\ge 2$ hours if needed, with a maximum daily oral dose of $200\\ \\mathrm{mg}$, and avoidance of other vasoconstrictive antimigraine agents (ergot derivatives, other triptans) within $24$ hours due to additive vasospasm risk.

This practice problem delves into a common and critical scenario: the metabolic inhibition of one drug by another, specifically involving the Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. By calculating the required dose adjustment for the CGRP receptor antagonist ubrogepant when co-administered with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, you will apply fundamental pharmacokinetic equations to make a reasoned, safety-critical clinical decision. [@problem_id:4975158]", "problem": "A patient with episodic migraine is prescribed oral ubrogepant, a small-molecule Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, at a standard single dose of $100$ mg for acute treatment. Ubrogepant is primarily metabolized by Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). The patient begins concomitant therapy with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. For this exercise, assume scientifically plausible linear pharmacokinetics with first-order elimination, that oral bioavailability is unchanged by the inhibitor, and that clinical efficacy is driven by achieving the same area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) as with $100$ mg ubrogepant in the absence of the inhibitor. Further assume that a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases ubrogepant exposure as measured by AUC by a factor of $3$ if the dose remains unchanged, and that volume of distribution does not change.\n\nUsing the core definitions of clearance and exposure for linear pharmacokinetics, derive the theoretical single adjusted ubrogepant dose that would maintain the target AUC achieved by $100$ mg without the inhibitor under the above assumptions. Then, based on the mechanism of CYP3A4 inhibition and practicality of available tablet strengths ($50$ mg and $100$ mg), provide a brief reasoned recommendation in your working as to whether dose adjustment or avoidance is more appropriate.\n\nExpress the final numerical answer as the theoretical single adjusted dose in mg, and round your answer to three significant figures. Use mg as the unit for the dose.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of pharmacokinetics, is well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and is expressed in objective, formalizable language.\n\nWe begin by establishing the fundamental relationship in linear pharmacokinetics for a single oral dose. The area under the plasma concentration–time curve ($AUC$), a measure of total drug exposure, is directly proportional to the dose ($D$) and the bioavailability ($F$), and inversely proportional to the total body clearance ($CL$) of the drug. This relationship is expressed as:\n$$AUC = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL}$$\n\nLet us denote the initial conditions (without the inhibitor) with the subscript $0$. The initial dose is $D_0 = 100$ mg. The clearance and bioavailability are $CL_0$ and $F_0$, respectively. The target exposure is the $AUC$ achieved under these conditions:\n$$AUC_{target} = \\frac{F_0 \\cdot D_0}{CL_0}$$\n\nNext, we consider the conditions with the concomitant administration of ketoconazole, a strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor. We denote the parameters in this state with the subscript `inhib`. The problem states we want to find an adjusted dose, $D_{adj}$, that achieves the same target exposure. The problem also specifies that the oral bioavailability ($F$) and volume of distribution ($V_d$) do not change. Therefore, $F_{inhib} = F_0$. The clearance, however, is reduced by the inhibitor, so we have a new clearance value, $CL_{inhib}$.\n\nThe $AUC$ with the adjusted dose and the inhibitor is:\n$$AUC_{adj} = \\frac{F_{inhib} \\cdot D_{adj}}{CL_{inhib}} = \\frac{F_0 \\cdot D_{adj}}{CL_{inhib}}$$\n\nTo maintain the same clinical efficacy, we must have $AUC_{adj} = AUC_{target}$.\n$$\\frac{F_0 \\cdot D_{adj}}{CL_{inhib}} = \\frac{F_0 \\cdot D_0}{CL_0}$$\nSince bioavailability $F_0$ is non-zero, we can simplify this to:\n$$\\frac{D_{adj}}{CL_{inhib}} = \\frac{D_0}{CL_0}$$\nThis gives us a formula for the adjusted dose in terms of the change in clearance:\n$$D_{adj} = D_0 \\cdot \\frac{CL_{inhib}}{CL_0}$$\n\nTo find the ratio of clearances, we use the crucial piece of information provided: a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases ubrogepant exposure ($AUC$) by a factor of $3$ if the dose remains unchanged. Let this factor be $k = 3$. This means that if the dose were kept at $D_0$ in the presence of the inhibitor, the resulting $AUC$, let's call it $AUC_{inhib,D_0}$, would be:\n$$AUC_{inhib,D_0} = k \\cdot AUC_{target}$$\nSubstituting the formulas for $AUC$:\n$$\\frac{F_0 \\cdot D_0}{CL_{inhib}} = k \\cdot \\left(\\frac{F_0 \\cdot D_0}{CL_0}\\right)$$\nThe terms $F_0$ and $D_0$ cancel, leaving a direct relationship between the clearances:\n$$\\frac{1}{CL_{inhib}} = \\frac{k}{CL_0} \\quad \\implies \\quad CL_{inhib} = \\frac{CL_0}{k}$$\nThis confirms that the inhibitor reduces clearance by a factor of $k$.\n\nNow we can calculate the adjusted dose, $D_{adj}$, by substituting this clearance relationship into our dose adjustment formula:\n$$D_{adj} = D_0 \\cdot \\frac{CL_{inhib}}{CL_0} = D_0 \\cdot \\frac{(CL_0/k)}{CL_0} = \\frac{D_0}{k}$$\nUsing the given values $D_0 = 100$ mg and $k=3$:\n$$D_{adj} = \\frac{100 \\text{ mg}}{3} \\approx 33.333... \\text{ mg}$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, the theoretical single adjusted dose is $33.3$ mg.\n\nFor the second part of the task, we provide a reasoned recommendation. The calculated theoretical dose is $33.3$ mg. The available tablet strengths for ubrogepant are $50$ mg and $100$ mg. It is not feasible to accurately obtain a $33.3$ mg dose from these formulations; splitting a $50$ mg tablet into thirds is imprecise and clinically unacceptable. Administering the lowest available dose of $50$ mg would result in an exposure that is approximately $50\\%$ higher than the target ($AUC_{50mg} / AUC_{target} = (50/CL_{inhib}) / (33.3/CL_{inhib}) = 1.5$), significantly increasing the risk of dose-dependent adverse effects. Given the large magnitude of the pharmacokinetic interaction, where total drug exposure can increase threefold or more, and the practical impossibility of safe dose reduction with available formulations, the most appropriate clinical action is to avoid the concomitant use of ubrogepant with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors like ketoconazole. An alternative acute migraine treatment not substantially metabolized by CYP3A4 should be considered for the patient.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{33.3}$$", "id": "4975158"}]}
