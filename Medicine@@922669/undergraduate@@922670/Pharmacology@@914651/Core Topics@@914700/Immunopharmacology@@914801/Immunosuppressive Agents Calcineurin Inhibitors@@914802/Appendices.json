Let $A(t)$ be the amount of drug in the body at time $t$.

This implies that for $t>0$, the rate of absorption is zero. The elimination process is first-order. The rate of elimination is defined in terms of clearance ($CL$) and concentration ($C(t)$) as:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Elimination} = CL \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nThus, for $t>0$, the mass balance equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -CL \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nThe concentration $C(t)$ is defined as the amount of drug $A(t)$ divided by the apparent volume of distribution $V$:\n$$\nC(t) = \\frac{A(t)}{V}\n$$\nThis allows us to express the amount of drug as $A(t) = V \\cdot C(t)$.
