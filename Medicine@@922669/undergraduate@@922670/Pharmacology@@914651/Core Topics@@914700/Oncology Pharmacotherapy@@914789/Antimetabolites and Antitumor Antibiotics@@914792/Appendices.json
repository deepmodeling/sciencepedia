We rearrange the equation to group terms involving $C$ and terms involving $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{C} dC = -k \\, dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides of the equation. The integration is performed from the initial time $t=0$, where the concentration is $C(0)=C_0$, to an arbitrary time $t$, where the concentration is $C(t)$.\n$$\n\\int_{C_0}^{C(t)} \\frac{1}{C'} dC' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, dt'\n$$\nEvaluating the definite integrals yields:\n$$\n[\\ln|C'|]_{C_0}^{C(t)} = [-kt']_{0}^{t}\n$$\nSince concentration $C$ is a physical quantity and must be positive, we can omit the absolute value signs.\n$$\n\\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C_0) = -kt - (-k \\cdot 0)\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C_0}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nTo solve for $C(t)$, we exponentiate both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C_0}\\right)\\right) = \\exp(-kt)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{C(t)}{C_0} = \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThus, the concentration of methotrexate at any time $t$ is given by:\n$$\nC(t) = C_0 \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThis is the general solution derived from first principles.\n\nNext, we must find the specific time $t^\\ast$ at which the concentration $C(t)$ falls to the target level of $0.1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu M}$. Let this target concentration be $C_{target} = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu M}$. We set $C(t^\\ast) = C_{target}$.\n$$\nC_{target} = C_0 \\exp(-kt^\\ast)\n$$\nWe now solve for $t^\\ast$. First, we isolate the exponential term:\n$$\n\\frac{C_{target}}{C_0} = \\exp(-kt^\\ast)\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{target}}{C_0}\\right) = -kt^\\ast\n$$\nFinally, we solve for $t^\\ast$:\n$$\nt^\\ast = -\\frac{1}{k} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{target}}{C_0}\\right) = \\frac{1}{k} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_0}{C_{target}}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression: $C_0 = 20\\ \\mathrm{\\mu M}$, $C_{target} = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu M}$, and $k = 0.12\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n$$\nt^\\ast = \\frac{1}{0.12\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{20\\ \\mathrm{\\mu M}}{0.1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu M}}\\right)\n$$\nThe units cancel appropriately, leaving the time in hours.\n$$\nt^\\ast = \\frac{1}{0.12} \\ln(200)\\ \\mathrm{h}\n$$\nWe calculate the numerical value:\n$$\n\\ln(200) \\approx 5.298317\n$$\n$$\nt^\\ast \\approx \\frac{5.298317}{0.12}\\ \\mathrm{h} \\approx 44.15264\\ \\mathrm{h}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nt^\\ast \\approx 44.2\\ \\mathrm{h}\n$$\n\n### Leucovorin Rescue Protocol Logic\n\nBased on the problem statement and the derived value of $t^\\ast$:\n1.  **Initiation**: The protocol explicitly states that leucovorin rescue is to be initiated at $t = 24\\ \\mathrm{h}$ after the methotrexate bolus. This is a fixed, policy-driven time point.\n2.  **Continuation Logic**: The protocol requires that the rescue be continued until the MTX plasma concentration falls below the toxicity threshold of $0.1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu M}$. Our calculation shows that this threshold is predicted to be crossed at $t^\\ast \\approx 44.2\\ \\mathrm{h}$. Therefore, the leucovorin rescue, which starts at $t=24\\ \\mathrm{h}$, must continue until at least $t \\approx 44.2\\ \\mathrm{h}$. In clinical practice, plasma levels are monitored, and the rescue is terminated only after a measurement confirms that $C(t) < 0.1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu M}$.

A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe fundamental principle governing the system at steady state is the conservation of mass, which dictates that the rate of drug administration must equal the rate of drug elimination.\n\nThe rate of drug administration is given as a constant infusion rate, $R_{0}$.\n\nThe rate of elimination follows Michaelis–Menten kinetics, which is dependent on the plasma concentration of the drug, $C$. At steady state, the concentration is constant, denoted as $C_{ss}$. The rate of elimination at steady state is therefore:\n$$ \\text{Rate of elimination} = \\frac{V_{\\max} \\cdot C_{ss}}{K_{m} + C_{ss}} $$\nEquating the rate of administration and the rate of elimination at steady state, we have:\n$$ R_{0} = \\frac{V_{\\max} \\cdot C_{ss}}{K_{m} + C_{ss}} $$\nThe problem defines the apparent steady-state total body clearance, $CL_{ss}$, as:\n$$ CL_{ss} = \\frac{R_{0}}{C_{ss}} $$\nThis definition is consistent with the general concept of clearance, which relates the rate of elimination to the concentration. At steady state, $R_0$ equals the rate of elimination.\n\nOur goal is to find $CL_{ss}$. We can derive an expression for $CL_{ss}$ in terms of the given parameters $R_{0}$, $V_{\\max}$, and $K_{m}$. From the definition of $CL_{ss}$, we can express the steady-state concentration as:\n$$ C_{ss} = \\frac{R_{0}}{CL_{ss}} $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $C_{ss}$ back into the steady-state mass balance equation:\n$$ R_{0} = \\frac{V_{\\max} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{R_{0}}{CL_{ss}}\\right)}{K_{m} + \\left(\\frac{R_{0}}{CL_{ss}}\\right)} $$\nSince the infusion rate $R_{0}$ is non-zero, we can divide both sides by $R_{0}$:\n$$ 1 = \\frac{\\frac{V_{\\max}}{CL_{ss}}}{K_{m} + \\frac{R_{0}}{CL_{ss}}} $$\nMultiplying both sides by the denominator gives:\n$$ K_{m} + \\frac{R_{0}}{CL_{ss}} = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{CL_{ss}} $$\nTo solve for $CL_{ss}$, we first gather all terms containing $CL_{ss}$ on one side of the equation:\n$$ K_{m} = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{CL_{ss}} - \\frac{R_{0}}{CL_{ss}} $$\n$$ K_{m} = \\frac{V_{\\max} - R_{0}}{CL_{ss}} $$\nFinally, we rearrange the equation to solve for $CL_{ss}$:\n$$ CL_{ss} = \\frac{V_{\\max} - R_{0}}{K_{m}} $$\nThis expression allows for the direct calculation of the apparent steady-state clearance from the given constants.\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this derived formula:\n- $R_{0} = 98 \\text{ mg/h}$\n- $V_{\\max} = 173 \\text{ mg/h}$\n- $K_{m} = 1.55 \\text{ mg/L}$\n\n$$ CL_{ss} = \\frac{173 \\text{ mg/h} - 98 \\text{ mg/h}}{1.55 \\text{ mg/L}} $$\n$$ CL_{ss} = \\frac{75 \\text{ mg/h}}{1.55 \\text{ mg/L}} $$\nThe units work out to be $\\text{L/h}$, as expected for clearance.\n$$ CL_{ss} = 48.38709677... \\text{ L/h} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ CL_{ss} \\approx 48.39 \\text{ L/h} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{48.39}$$", "id": "4924116"}, {"introduction": "The one-size-fits-all approach to medicine is rapidly being replaced by strategies tailored to the individual patient.

Define a genotype-specific factor $f$ that scales the effective cytotoxic exposure per unit administered dose such that the effective dose is $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}=f \\cdot D$.
