Paclitaxel is a real drug, and the given dosage regimen and clearance value are clinically plausible. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to calculate the requested quantity, $\\text{AUC}_{0-\\infty}$. The requested quantity is well-defined in pharmacology. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. The inclusion of the infusion duration ($3\\,\\mathrm{h}$) does not create a contradiction but tests the understanding that for a system with linear clearance, the total AUC is independent of the rate of drug administration. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Proceed to Solution\n\nThe objective is to compute the Area Under the plasma concentration-Time Curve from time zero to infinity, denoted as $\\text{AUC}_{0-\\infty}$. This value represents the total systemic exposure of the patient to the drug.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the total dose of paclitaxel administered to the patient. The dose is given per unit of body surface area (BSA).\nLet the total dose be denoted by $\\text{Dose}$.\n$$\n\\text{Dose} = (\\text{Dose per BSA}) \\times \\text{BSA}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\text{Dose} = (175\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}) \\times (1.8\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}) = 315\\,\\mathrm{mg}\n$$\n\nNext, we apply a fundamental principle of pharmacokinetics. For any drug that follows linear, time-invariant kinetics, the total systemic exposure ($\\text{AUC}_{0-\\infty}$) is directly proportional to the total amount of drug that reaches the systemic circulation and inversely proportional to the drug's systemic clearance ($\\text{CL}$). This relationship is expressed as:\n$$\n\\text{AUC}_{0-\\infty} = \\frac{F \\times \\text{Dose}}{\\text{CL}}\n$$\nwhere $F$ is the bioavailability factor, representing the fraction of the administered dose that reaches the systemic circulation. For intravenous administration, the entire dose enters the systemic circulation directly, so the bioavailability is complete, meaning $F=1$.\n\nTherefore, the formula simplifies to:\n$$\n\\text{AUC}_{0-\\infty} = \\frac{\\text{Dose}}{\\text{CL}}\n$$\nThis equation is a cornerstone of pharmacokinetics and is derived from the definition of clearance. It holds true regardless of the number of compartments in the pharmacokinetic model and, importantly, is independent of the rate or duration of drug administration (e.g., a bolus injection versus a slow infusion). Thus, the given infusion duration of $3\\,\\mathrm{h}$ is not needed for this calculation.\n\nWe have all the necessary values to compute the $\\text{AUC}_{0-\\infty}$:\n- Total Dose = $315\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n- Systemic Clearance, $\\text{CL} = 15\\,\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{h}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$\n\\text{AUC}_{0-\\infty} = \\frac{315\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{15\\,\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{h}}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\n\\text{AUC}_{0-\\infty} = 21\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\cdot\\mathrm{h}/\\mathrm{L}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures. The input values with the lowest precision are $\\text{BSA} = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$ and $\\text{CL} = 15\\,\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{h}$, both of which have two significant figures. Our calculated result, $21$, already has exactly two significant figures ($2$ and $1$). Therefore, no further rounding is necessary.

A rightward shift greater than $10$-fold with a reduced $E_{\\max}$ because intrinsic efficacy decreases in the mutant.", "solution": "## Solution Derivation\n\nThe concentration-response relationship is described as a sigmoidal curve. For a drug ($L$) inducing an effect ($E$) through binding to a receptor, this relationship can often be modeled by the Hill equation:\n$$E = \\frac{E_{\\max} \\cdot [L]^{n_H}}{EC_{50}^{n_H} + [L]^{n_H}}$$\nwhere $E_{\\max}$ is the maximal effect, $[L]$ is the drug concentration, $EC_{50}$ is the concentration that produces $50\\%$ of the maximal effect, and $n_H$ is the Hill coefficient, which describes the steepness (slope) of the curve.\n\nThe problem states that for wild-type cells, the slope is \"approximately unity\". This implies $n_H \\approx 1$. When $n_H=1$, the Hill equation simplifies to the form of the Langmuir isotherm or Michaelis-Menten kinetics:\n$$E = \\frac{E_{\\max} \\cdot [L]}{EC_{50} + [L]}$$\n\nThe effect ($E$) is a consequence of the drug binding to its target. The fractional occupancy ($Y$) of the target by the drug under the assumption of simple reversible binding at equilibrium is given by:\n$$Y = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}$$\nwhere $K_d$ is the dissociation constant, a measure of binding affinity (a lower $K_d$ means higher affinity).\n\nThe problem states that the intrinsic efficacy of the taxane is unchanged. Intrinsic efficacy relates target occupancy to the biological response. As the expression level of the target ($\\beta$-tubulin) and the total microtubule content are also unchanged, we can assume a direct, linear relationship between fractional target occupancy and the normalized response, such that $E = E_{\\max} \\cdot Y$. Substituting the expression for $Y$:\n$$E = E_{\\max} \\cdot \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}$$\nBy comparing this equation derived from first principles with the operational model for the response, we find a direct equivalence between the operational parameter $EC_{50}$ and the biochemical parameter $K_d$:\n$$EC_{50} = K_d$$\nThis relationship holds true in simple systems without receptor reserve and with a linear stimulus-response coupling, conditions which are implied by the problem's setup (normalized response, unity slope, unchanged intrinsic efficacy).\n\nWe are given the following information for the wild-type (WT) and mutant (MUT) cells:\n- $EC_{50, WT} = 10\\,\\text{nM}$. Therefore, $K_{d, WT} \\approx 10\\,\\text{nM}$.\n- The mutation increases the dissociation constant by $10$-fold: $K_{d, MUT} = 10 \\cdot K_{d, WT}$.\n\nUsing the relationships established above, we can predict the parameters for the mutant cell curve:\n1.  **Change in $EC_{50}$**: Since $EC_{50} \\approx K_d$, a $10$-fold increase in $K_d$ will result in a $10$-fold increase in $EC_{50}$.\n    $$EC_{50, MUT} \\approx K_{d, MUT} = 10 \\cdot K_{d, WT} \\approx 10 \\cdot EC_{50, WT}$$\n    $$EC_{50, MUT} \\approx 10 \\cdot (10\\,\\text{nM}) = 100\\,\\text{nM}$$\n    An increase in $EC_{50}$ from $10\\,\\text{nM}$ to $100\\,\\text{nM}$ signifies a **rightward shift** of the concentration-response curve along the concentration axis.\n\n2.  **Change in $E_{\\max}$**: The problem explicitly states that \"intrinsic efficacy of the taxane when bound\" is unchanged. Furthermore, the \"$\\beta$-tubulin expression level\" is also unchanged, meaning the total number of available targets is the same. Therefore, the maximal possible response the system can generate remains the same. Since the response is normalized to $1.0$ for the wild-type, the maximal effect for the mutant will also be $1.0$.\n    $$E_{\\max, MUT} = E_{\\max, WT} = 1.0$$\n\n3.  **Change in Slope ($n_H$)**: The problem states that the wild-type slope is approximately unity ($n_H \\approx 1$), indicating non-cooperative binding. It further states that \"no cooperative interactions emerge from the mutation\". This means the mechanism of binding remains non-cooperative, and thus the slope of the curve should remain unchanged.\n    $$n_{H, MUT} \\approx n_{H, WT} \\approx 1$$\n\nIn summary, the mutation is predicted to cause an approximately $10$-fold increase in the $EC_{50}$ (a rightward shift of the curve on a log-concentration plot) with no change in the maximal effect ($E_{\\max}$) or the slope of the curve.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. A rightward shift of the curve with an approximately $10$-fold increase in EC$_{50}$, with unchanged $E_{\\max}$ and slope.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement perfectly matches our derived predictions. The increase in $K_d$ by a factor of $10$ directly translates to a $10$-fold increase in $EC_{50}$, causing a rightward shift. The unchanged intrinsic efficacy and target number ensure $E_{\\max}$ is constant, and the lack of emergent cooperativity keeps the slope constant.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. A leftward shift of the curve with an approximately $10$-fold decrease in EC$_{50}$, accompanied by a reduced $E_{\\max}$.**\n- **Evaluation:** This is incorrect on multiple points. A $10$-fold increase in $K_d$ signifies *reduced* binding affinity, which necessitates a *higher* drug concentration for a given effect, leading to a *rightward* shift and an *increase* in $EC_{50}$. A leftward shift would imply increased affinity. Furthermore, $E_{\\max}$ is predicted to be unchanged, not reduced.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. A rightward shift with unchanged EC$_{50}$ but a reduced $E_{\\max}$ because fewer targets are available.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option is internally contradictory and factually wrong based on the problem statement. A \"rightward shift\" is fundamentally a change (an increase) in $EC_{50}$, so \"rightward shift with unchanged $EC_{50}$\" is nonsensical. $E_{\\max}$ is not reduced. The reason given, \"fewer targets are available,\" directly contradicts the given that \"$\\beta$-tubulin expression level\" is unchanged.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. No horizontal shift in EC$_{50}$ but an increase in slope, with $E_{\\max}$ unchanged.**\n- **Evaluation:** This is incorrect. There will be a horizontal shift because the $10$-fold increase in $K_d$ causes a $10$-fold increase in $EC_{50}$. The slope is not expected to increase, as no new cooperativity is introduced. While the prediction for $E_{\\max}$ is correct, the other claims are false.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. A rightward shift greater than $10$-fold with a reduced $E_{\\max}$ because intrinsic efficacy decreases in the mutant.**\n- **Evaluation:** This is incorrect. The shift is expected to be approximately $10$-fold, proportional to the change in $K_d$. It also wrongly claims a reduced $E_{\\max}$ and gives a reason, \"intrinsic efficacy decreases,\" which directly contradicts a premise of the problem.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4962989"}, {"introduction": "Beyond systemic exposure and target affinity, a drug's efficacy depends on its ability to accumulate at its intracellular site of action.
