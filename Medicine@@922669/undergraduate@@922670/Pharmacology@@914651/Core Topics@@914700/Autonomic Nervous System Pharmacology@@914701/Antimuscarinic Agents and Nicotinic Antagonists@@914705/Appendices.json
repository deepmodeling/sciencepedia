In the eye, ciliary muscle contraction tensions the scleral spur and expands trabecular meshwork pores; iris sphincter contraction causes miosis.

The initial flow of \"approximately $20$\" is derived by using the healthy baseline resistance ($R_{\\mathrm{out}}=2$) with the patient's compensated pressure ($P_{\\mathrm{det}}=40$), i.e., $40/2=20$. While it is more logical to compare the patient's pre- and post-drug states ($10 \\to 5$), the option seems to be comparing the final state to a hypothetical healthy state, though phrased as a direct \"fall\". Despite this imprecise phrasing, the core mechanisms and calculations are sound.\n    -   **Verdict**: Correct. This is the best description among the choices.\n\n*   **B. Intraocular pressure decreases because relaxation of the ciliary muscle opens the trabecular meshwork; urine flow increases because antimuscarinics relax the internal urethral sphincter via M3, reducing outlet resistance. Numerically, intraocular pressure falls to approximately $12\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ and urine flow rises above baseline.**\n    -   **Mechanistic Reasoning**: Both stated mechanisms are incorrect. Ciliary muscle relaxation *reduces* trabecular outflow. Antimuscarinic action on the bladder *impairs* voiding by reducing detrusor pressure; it does not significantly reduce outlet resistance. The problem explicitly states $R_{\\mathrm{out}}$ is unchanged.\n    -   **Numerical Values**: The numerical predictions are contrary to our calculations.\n    -   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n*   **C. Intraocular pressure increases only slightly because episcleral venous pressure dominates; urine flow increases because detrusor relaxation reduces intravesical pressure, facilitating flow through a narrowed prostate. Numerically, intraocular pressure rises to approximately $18\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ and urine flow increases above baseline.**\n    -   **Mechanistic Reasoning**: The IOP reasoning is flawed; the change in $C_{\\mathrm{trab}}$ is the dominant factor for the *change* in IOP, which is significant. The urine flow reasoning is nonsensical; reducing driving pressure decreases flow.\n    -   **Numerical Values**: The numerical predictions for both IOP ($18\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$) and urine flow are incorrect.\n    -   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n*   **D. Intraocular pressure and urine flow remain near baseline because M3 blockade is compensated by other pathways.
