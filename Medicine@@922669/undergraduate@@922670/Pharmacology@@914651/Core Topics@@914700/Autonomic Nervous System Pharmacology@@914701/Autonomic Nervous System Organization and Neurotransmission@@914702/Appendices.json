The effect at each organ depends on the type of muscarinic or nicotinic receptors present. A \"sympathetic burst\" implies widespread activation of the sympathetic nervous system's efferent pathways.\n\n1.  **Cardiovascular System:**\n    -   **Heart:** Sympathetic nerves innervate the sinoatrial (SA) node, atrioventricular (AV) node, and ventricular myocardium. Normally, norepinephrine (NE) acts on $\\beta_1$-adrenergic receptors to increase heart rate (tachycardia) and contractility. In this scenario, released ACh will act on the heart's M$_2$ muscarinic receptors. This will cause a decrease in heart rate (**bradycardia**) and AV conduction.\n    -   **Blood Vessels:** Sympathetic nerves innervate the smooth muscle of arterioles and veins. Normally, NE acts on $\\alpha_1$-adrenergic receptors to cause vasoconstriction. In this scenario, the released ACh will act on M$_3$ muscarinic receptors on the intact vascular endothelium. This stimulates nitric oxide (NO) release, causing profound relaxation and **generalized vasodilation**.\n    -   **Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP):** The combination of bradycardia (decreased cardiac output) and generalized vasodilation (decreased systemic vascular resistance) will cause a significant **fall in mean arterial pressure**.\n\n2.  **Respiratory System:**\n    -   **Bronchial Smooth Muscle & Glands:** ACh will act on M$_3$ muscarinic receptors, causing **bronchoconstriction** and an **increase in airway secretions**.\n\n3.  **Eye:**\n    -   **Iris:** The sympathetic system normally innervates the radial muscle of the iris, causing dilation (mydriasis) via $\\alpha_1$ receptors. The radial muscle lacks significant muscarinic receptors, so this dilator function is lost. The net result is a **failure of mydriasis** and likely **miosis** due to unopposed parasympathetic tone.\n\n4.  **Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract:**\n    -   **Motility & Secretions:** ACh will act on M$_3$ muscarinic receptors, leading to an **increase in gastrointestinal motility and secretion**.\n\n5.  **Urinary System:**\n    -   **Bladder:** ACh will act on M$_3$ receptors of the detrusor muscle, causing it to **contract**. The normal sympathetic contractile tone on the internal urethral sphincter (via $\\alpha_1$ receptors) will be lost, resulting in **reduced internal urethral sphincter tone**.\n\n6.  **Sweat Glands:**\n    -   **Eccrine Glands:** This pathway is normally cholinergic (sympathetic nerves release ACh onto M$_3$ receptors). Therefore, **eccrine sweating will be preserved** and activated.\n\n**Summary of Effects:** The overall pattern resembles a massive parasympathetic discharge, but with a distribution matching that of the sympathetic nervous system. This includes bradycardia, hypotension, bronchoconstriction, miosis, increased GI activity, urination, and sweating.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Bradycardia, generalized vasodilation with a fall in mean arterial pressure, bronchoconstriction with increased airway secretions, failure of mydriasis with net miosis, increased gastrointestinal motility and secretion, detrusor contraction with reduced internal urethral sphincter tone, and eccrine sweating preserved**\nThis option accurately lists all the physiological consequences derived from first principles. It correctly predicts a systemic muscarinic activation pattern.\n\n**B. Tachycardia, generalized vasoconstriction with a rise in mean arterial pressure, bronchodilation, mydriasis, decreased gastrointestinal motility, and urinary retention because acetylcholine drives epinephrine release**\nThis option describes the normal sympathetic response mediated by norepinephrine. All effects are the opposite of what would occur.\n\n**C. Minimal cardiovascular change with predominant metabolic stimulation (hepatic glycogenolysis and adipose lipolysis), because the heart and vessels lack muscarinic receptors while liver and adipose tissue are muscarinic responsive**\nThis option is factually incorrect. The heart and blood vessels have functionally important muscarinic receptors. The major metabolic effects listed are mediated by adrenergic, not muscarinic, receptors.\n\n**D. Isolated skeletal muscle vasodilation with otherwise unchanged organs, because only skeletal muscle vasculature is innervated by cholinergic sympathetic fibers**\nThis option misinterprets the problem's premise. The problem states that *every* postganglionic sympathetic neuron is altered, so the effects would be generalized, not isolated to the normal cholinergic pathways.\n\nTherefore, option A is the only one that correctly predicts the systemic pattern.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4927372"}]}
