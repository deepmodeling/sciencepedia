Both ligands bind reversibly to the same orthosteric site, so their binding is mutually exclusive.\n\nThe equilibrium for agonist binding is:\n$$A + R \\rightleftharpoons AR$$\nwith an equilibrium dissociation constant $K_A$ defined as:\n$$K_A = \\frac{[A][R]}{[AR]}$$\nwhere $[A]$, $[R]$, and $[AR]$ are the molar concentrations of the free agonist, free receptor, and agonist-receptor complex, respectively.\n\nThe equilibrium for antagonist binding is:\n$$B + R \\rightleftharpoons BR$$\nwith an equilibrium dissociation constant $K_B$ defined as:\n$$K_B = \\frac{[B][R]}{[BR]}$$\nwhere $[B]$ and $[BR]$ are the molar concentrations of the free antagonist and antagonist-receptor complex, respectively.\n\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R]_{tot}$, is the sum of all receptor states:\n$$[R]_{tot} = [R] + [AR] + [BR]$$\nFrom the definitions of the dissociation constants, we can express $[AR]$ and $[BR]$ in terms of $[R]$:\n$$[AR] = \\frac{[A][R]}{K_A}$$\n$$[BR] = \\frac{[B][R]}{K_B}$$\nSubstituting these into the equation for $[R]_{tot}$:\n$$[R]_{tot} = [R] + \\frac{[A][R]}{K_A} + \\frac{[B][R]}{K_B} = [R] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_A} + \\frac{[B]}{K_B} \\right)$$\nThe fractional occupancy of the receptor by the agonist, $p_A$, is the ratio of the concentration of agonist-bound receptors to the total receptor concentration:\n$$p_A = \\frac{[AR]}{[R]_{tot}} = \\frac{\\frac{[A][R]}{K_A}}{[R] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_A} + \\frac{[B]}{K_B} \\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{[A]}{K_A}}{1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_A} + \\frac{[B]}{K_B}}$$\nTo simplify, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $K_A$:\n$$p_A = \\frac{[A]}{K_A + [A] + [B]\\frac{K_A}{K_B}}$$\nRearranging the denominator gives the occupancy equation in the presence of a competitive antagonist:\n$$p_A = \\frac{[A]}{K_A \\left( 1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_B} \\right) + [A]}$$\nThe problem states that the effect, $E$, is proportional to receptor occupancy, $p_A$. Let $E = \\epsilon \\cdot p_A$, where $\\epsilon$ is the intrinsic efficacy. The maximal response, $E_{max}$, occurs when all receptors are occupied by the agonist, which corresponds to $p_A=1$ (at infinitely high $[A]$), so $E_{max} = \\epsilon$. Therefore, $E = E_{max} \\cdot p_A$.\n\nIn the absence of the antagonist ($[B]=0$), the equation simplifies to:\n$$p_A = \\frac{[A]}{K_A + [A]}$$\nThe $EC_{50}$ is the agonist concentration that produces half of the maximal effect ($E = E_{max}/2$). This implies $p_A = 1/2$. For the control condition:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{EC_{50}^{\\text{control}}}{K_A + EC_{50}^{\\text{control}}}$$\nSolving for $K_A$ gives $K_A = EC_{50}^{\\text{control}}$.\n\nIn the presence of the antagonist, the agonist concentration required to achieve $p_A = 1/2$ is the new $EC_{50}$, which we will denote $EC_{50}^{\\text{new}}$.\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{EC_{50}^{\\text{new}}}{K_A \\left( 1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_B} \\right) + EC_{50}^{\\text{new}}}$$\nSolving for $EC_{50}^{\\text{new}}$ gives:\n$$EC_{50}^{\\text{new}} = K_A \\left( 1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_B} \\right)$$\nThe dose ratio, $DR$, is defined as the ratio of agonist concentrations required to produce the same effect in the presence and absence of the antagonist. For the half-maximal effect, this is:\n$$DR = \\frac{EC_{50}^{\\text{new}}}{EC_{50}^{\\text{control}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions we found:\n$$DR = \\frac{K_A \\left( 1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_B} \\right)}{K_A} = 1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_B}$$\nThis is the Gaddum-Schild equation, the required expression for the dose ratio.\n\nNext, we address the assumptions distinguishing reversible orthosteric competitive antagonism from negative allosteric modulation (NAM).\nFor atropine's reversible orthosteric competitive antagonism:\n1.  **Shared Binding Site**: The antagonist (atropine) and agonist (acetylcholine) bind to the same (orthosteric) site on the receptor. This binding is mutually exclusive.\n2.  **No Efficacy**: The antagonist has zero intrinsic efficacy; its binding does not elicit a response.\n3.  **Maximal Response**: The antagonism is surmountable. By increasing the agonist concentration sufficiently, the agonist can displace all antagonist molecules from the receptor, and the maximal response ($E_{max}$) remains unchanged. The concentration-response curve is shifted to the right in a parallel manner.\n4.  **Schild Plot**: A Schild plot of $\\log_{10}(DR-1)$ versus $\\log_{10}([B])$ yields a straight line with a slope of exactly $1$. The x-intercept of this plot gives the negative logarithm of the antagonist's dissociation constant, $pK_B$.\n\nFor a negative allosteric modulator (NAM):\n1.  **Separate Binding Site**: The NAM binds to an allosteric site, which is topographically distinct from the orthosteric site where the agonist binds.\n2.  **Conformational Change**: The NAM's binding induces a conformational change in the receptor that can reduce the agonist's affinity (increase $K_A$) and/or reduce its efficacy ($\\epsilon$).\n3.  **Maximal Response**: If the NAM reduces the agonist's efficacy, the antagonism is non-surmountable (or insurmountable). Even at saturating agonist concentrations, the maximal response ($E_{max}$) will be depressed. If the NAM only affects affinity, the $E_{max}$ may be preserved, but the mechanism is still distinct.\n4.  **Schild Plot**: The Gaddum-Schild equation does not apply. A Schild plot for a NAM will generally not be a straight line with a slope of unity. The slope is often less than $1$ and the plot can be nonlinear, precluding a simple determination of $K_B$.\n\nFinally, we compute the rightward shift and the new $EC_{50}$ for acetylcholine in the presence of atropine.\nThe given values are:\n- $EC_{50}^{\\text{control}} = 5\\,\\text{nM}$\n- Antagonist concentration $[B] = 30\\,\\text{nM}$\n- Antagonist dissociation constant $K_B = 10\\,\\text{nM}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dose ratio ($DR$) using the derived Gaddum-Schild equation:\n$$DR = 1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_B} = 1 + \\frac{30\\,\\text{nM}}{10\\,\\text{nM}} = 1 + 3 = 4$$\nThe dose ratio of $4$ indicates that four times the concentration of acetylcholine is required to produce any given level of response in the presence of $30\\,\\text{nM}$ atropine compared to the control condition. This represents a $4$-fold rightward shift of the concentration-response curve.\n\nThe new half-maximal effective concentration, $EC_{50}^{\\text{new}}$, is calculated by multiplying the control $EC_{50}$ by the dose ratio:\n$$EC_{50}^{\\text{new}} = DR \\times EC_{50}^{\\text{control}}$$\n$$EC_{50}^{\\text{new}} = 4 \\times 5\\,\\text{nM} = 20\\,\\text{nM}$$\nThe new $EC_{50}$ in the presence of $30\\,\\text{nM}$ atropine is $20\\,\\text{nM}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20}$$", "id": "4932957"}, {"introduction": "A drug's effectiveness is determined not only by its interaction with a target but also by its ability to reach that target.

Although this fraction is small, the equilibrium between the ionized and unionized forms is dynamic. As the unionized molecules cross the BBB, Le Châtelier's principle dictates that the equilibrium will shift to replenish the unionized form from the ionized pool, thus enabling continuous, albeit potentially slow, transport into the CNS.\n\nA quaternary ammonium analog has a structure of the type $R_4N^+$, where the nitrogen atom is bonded to four carbon atoms and bears a permanent positive charge. This charge cannot be neutralized by the gain or loss of a proton under any physiological $pH$ conditions. Consequently, a quaternary ammonium compound is $100\\%$ ionized at all times. The fraction of its unionized form is effectively zero.\n\nTherefore, because the tertiary amine possesses a non-zero fraction of the membrane-permeable unionized species while the quaternary ammonium analog does not, passive CNS penetration is expected to be **more likely** for the tertiary amine inhibitor.
