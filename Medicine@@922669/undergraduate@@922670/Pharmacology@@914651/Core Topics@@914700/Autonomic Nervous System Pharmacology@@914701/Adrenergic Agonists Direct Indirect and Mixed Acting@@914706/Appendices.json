This first practice invites you to explore the foundational relationship between drug concentration and receptor occupancy by applying the law of mass action. You will then take a crucial step further by examining how this binding translates into a physiological effect, considering the important concept of \"spare receptors,\" which explains why a maximal response can sometimes be achieved without occupying every available receptor [@problem_id:4916391].", "problem": "A direct-acting adrenergic agonist binds to receptors according to the law of mass action at equilibrium. For a ligand concentration $[L]$ and an equilibrium dissociation constant $K_{d}$, the fractional receptor occupancy $f$ is defined as the ratio of ligand-bound receptor to the total receptor and is a dimensionless quantity. In an isolated cardiac preparation expressing $\\beta_{1}$-adrenoceptors, a solution of isoproterenol (a direct-acting nonselective $\\beta$-adrenoceptor agonist) at $[L]=30$ nM is applied. The $\\beta_{1}$-adrenoceptor has $K_{d}=5$ nM, and the receptor density (maximum binding capacity) is $B_{\\text{max}}=100$ fmol per mg tissue.\n\nStarting from the definition of $K_{d}$ and mass-action binding at equilibrium, derive the fractional occupancy $f$ at $[L]=30$ nM. Then, based on the concept of spare receptors (receptor reserve), suppose the cardiac tissue exhibits a receptor reserve of $50\\%$, meaning that a maximal inotropic effect can be achieved when only $50\\%$ of receptors are occupied. Use principled reasoning to determine the predicted fraction of maximal inotropic effect, $E/E_{\\text{max}}$, at $[L]=30$ nM. You may assume monotonic coupling between occupancy and effect and that once the occupancy meets or exceeds the threshold implied by the receptor reserve, the maximal effect is achievable.\n\nAlthough you may compute the bound receptor amount $B_{\\text{bound}}=f\\,B_{\\text{max}}$ in fmol per mg as part of your reasoning, your final reported quantity must be the predicted fraction of maximal inotropic effect $E/E_{\\text{max}}$.\n\nRound your final $E/E_{\\text{max}}$ value to four significant figures. Express the final answer as a pure number (no units).", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the predicted fraction of maximal inotropic effect, denoted as $E/E_{\\text{max}}$, for a direct-acting adrenergic agonist in a system exhibiting a receptor reserve. The solution involves two main steps: first, calculating the fractional receptor occupancy based on the law of mass action, and second, relating this occupancy to the physiological effect using the concept of spare receptors.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Calculation of Fractional Receptor Occupancy ($f$)**\n\nThe interaction between a ligand ($L$) and a receptor ($R$) to form a ligand-receptor complex ($LR$) is a reversible process governed by the equilibrium:\n$$ [L] + [R] \\rightleftharpoons [LR] $$\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the law of mass action at equilibrium as:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[L][R]}{[LR]} $$\nHere, $[L]$ represents the concentration of the free ligand, $[R]$ is the concentration of unbound (free) receptors, and $[LR]$ is the concentration of the ligand-receptor complex.\n\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R_T]$, is the sum of the free and bound receptor concentrations:\n$$ [R_T] = [R] + [LR] $$\nThe fractional receptor occupancy, $f$, is defined as the fraction of total receptors that are bound by the ligand:\n$$ f = \\frac{[LR]}{[R_T]} $$\nTo derive an expression for $f$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_d$, we first express $[R]$ in terms of $[R_T]$ and $[LR]$:\n$$ [R] = [R_T] - [LR] $$\nWe substitute this into the expression for $K_d$:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[L]([R_T] - [LR])}{[LR]} $$\nWe then algebraically rearrange this equation to solve for the ratio $[LR]/[R_T]$:\n$$ K_d [LR] = [L][R_T] - [L][LR] $$\n$$ [LR](K_d + [L]) = [L][R_T] $$\n$$ \\frac{[LR]}{[R_T]} = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]} $$\nSubstituting the definition of $f$, we arrive at the Hill-Langmuir equation:\n$$ f = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]} $$\nThe problem provides the necessary values: the ligand concentration is $[L] = 30$ nM, and the equilibrium dissociation constant for the $\\beta_1$-adrenoceptor is $K_d = 5$ nM.\n\nSubstituting these values into the Hill-Langmuir equation gives the fractional occupancy:\n$$ f = \\frac{30 \\text{ nM}}{5 \\text{ nM} + 30 \\text{ nM}} = \\frac{30}{35} = \\frac{6}{7} $$\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $f \\approx 0.85714$. The information regarding the receptor density, $B_{\\text{max}} = 100$ fmol per mg tissue, allows for the calculation of the absolute amount of bound receptors, $B_{\\text{bound}} = f \\cdot B_{\\text{max}} = (6/7) \\times 100 \\approx 85.7$ fmol/mg. However, this absolute value is not needed to determine the fractional effect $E/E_{\\text{max}}$.\n\n**Part 2: Relating Occupancy to Fractional Effect ($E/E_{\\text{max}}$)**\n\nThe problem states that the tissue has a receptor reserve of $50\\%$. This is explicitly defined to mean that a maximal inotropic effect ($E = E_{\\text{max}}$) is achieved when only $50\\%$ of the total receptors are occupied. This establishes an occupancy threshold, which we can denote as $f_{\\text{threshold}}$, for achieving the maximal response.\n$$ f_{\\text{threshold}} = 50\\% = 0.5 $$\nThe problem further assumes that \"once the occupancy meets or exceeds the threshold implied by the receptor reserve, the maximal effect is achievable.\" This describes a system where the response saturates and reaches its maximum value as soon as the occupancy reaches this threshold.\n\nWe must compare the calculated fractional occupancy, $f$, with the threshold occupancy, $f_{\\text{threshold}}$, to determine the level of physiological response.\nThe calculated fractional occupancy is $f = 6/7$.\nThe threshold for maximal effect is $f_{\\text{threshold}} = 0.5 = 1/2$.\n\nTo compare these fractions:\n$f = 6/7 \\approx 0.8571$\n$f_{\\text{threshold}} = 0.5$\nClearly, $f > f_{\\text{threshold}}$, since $6/7 > 1/2$.\n\nBecause the actual fractional occupancy ($6/7$) exceeds the threshold occupancy required for a maximal response ($0.5$), the system will produce its maximal inotropic effect. Therefore, the observed effect $E$ is equal to the maximal possible effect $E_{\\text{max}}$.\n$$ E = E_{\\text{max}} $$\nThe fraction of the maximal inotropic effect is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\text{max}}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{max}}}{E_{\\text{max}}} = 1 $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. To express the number $1$ with this precision, we write it as $1.000$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.000}$$", "id": "4916391"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the molecular to the systemic level, this exercise demonstrates how the activation of a specific adrenergic receptor subtype translates into a measurable physiological change.

This final practice delves into the dynamic process of tachyphylaxis, the rapid diminishing of response to successive doses of a drug. By creating a simple mass-balance model for an indirect-acting sympathomimetic, you will track the depletion and replenishment of norepinephrine stores, providing a clear, quantitative insight into why the effectiveness of drugs like pseudoephedrine can wane with repeated use [@problem_id:4916396].", "problem": "A mixed-acting adrenergic agonist such as pseudoephedrine primarily produces its effect by promoting release of norepinephrine (NE) from presynaptic storage vesicles (indirect action) and, to a lesser extent, by directly stimulating adrenergic receptors (direct action). Tachyphylaxis to indirect sympathomimetics arises when repeated dosing releases NE faster than it is replenished, depleting presynaptic stores. Consider a patient receiving pseudoephedrine doses at regular intervals with the following parameters:\n\n- Initial presynaptic norepinephrine store immediately before the first dose is $S_0 = 100$ arbitrary units (AU).\n- Each dose causes an instantaneous release of $\\Delta = 20$ AU of norepinephrine from the store. Release is limited by available store, so the actual released amount equals $\\min(\\Delta, S)$ at the moment of dosing.\n- Between doses, the store is replenished at a constant rate $r = 5$ AU per hour due to biosynthesis and vesicular refilling.\n- Dosing interval is $T = 4$ hours, and there is no other loss process acting on the store between doses.\n\nDefine $S_n$ to be the presynaptic norepinephrine store immediately after the $n$-th dose is given. Using mass balance grounded in the mechanism of indirect sympathomimetic action and linear replenishment of stores, compute $S_1$, $S_2$, and $S_3$ over three consecutive doses.
