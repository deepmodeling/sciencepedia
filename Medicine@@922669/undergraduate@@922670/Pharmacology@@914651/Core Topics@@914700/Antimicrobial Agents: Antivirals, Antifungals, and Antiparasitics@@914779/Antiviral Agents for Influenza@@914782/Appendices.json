A flexible subsite, involving glutamate at position $276$ (Glu$276$), can form a transient hydrophobic pocket. This pocket accommodates the pentyl ether of oseltamivir. Zanamivir lacks this hydrophobic appendage and relies more on polar contacts, such as with glutamate at position $119$ (Glu$119$) and an arginine triad.\n- **Mutations**:\n  1. H274Y: Histidine to tyrosine at position $274$. This mutation sterically blocks the conformational change that creates the hydrophobic pocket.\n  2. E119V: Glutamate to valine at position $119$. This mutation removes a negatively charged hydrogen-bond acceptor.\n- **Temperature**: The experiment is performed at $T = 298$ K.\n- **Binding Energy Contributions (Model)**:\n  - Hydrophobic pocket contribution ($\\Delta G_{HP}$):\n    - Oseltamivir: $\\Delta G_{HP, osel} \\approx -1.36$ kcal/mol.\n    - Zanamivir: $\\Delta G_{HP, zana} \\approx 0.00$ kcal/mol.\n  - Glutamate-$119$ contribution ($\\Delta G_{E119}$):\n    - Zanamivir: $\\Delta G_{E119, zana} \\approx -1.20$ kcal/mol.\n    - Oseltamivir: $\\Delta G_{E119, osel} \\approx -0.30$ kcal/mol.\n- **Assumptions**:\n  1. Binding is modeled as the sum of independent interaction energy contributions.\n  2. H274Y mutation eliminates the hydrophobic pocket contribution ($\\Delta G_{HP}$) but leaves other interactions unchanged.\n  3. E119V mutation eliminates the glutamate-$119$ contribution ($\\Delta G_{E119}$) but leaves other interactions unchanged.\n  4. Changes in binding free energy ($\\Delta G_{bind}$) map to proportional changes in the inhibition constant ($K_i$) via standard thermodynamics.\n\n#### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated based on the established criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly rooted in the principles of biophysical chemistry and pharmacology. The structural details of neuraminidase and its inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir are factually correct. The mechanism of resistance via mutations like H274Y and E119V is well-documented in virology. The use of a linear free energy relationship, where total binding energy is a sum of contributions, is a common and valid simplifying assumption in medicinal chemistry. The thermodynamic relationship between binding free energy and inhibition constant is a cornerstone of the field.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary numerical data and a clear set of assumptions to calculate the fold-change in $K_i$. The question is specific and a unique solution can be derived from the given information.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise and technical. All statements are factual or presented as explicit assumptions for the model. There is no subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. It provides all the necessary energy values, the temperature, and the specific effects of the mutations. There are no internal contradictions. The data are dimensionally consistent (energy in kcal/mol, temperature in K).\n- **Realism**: The energy values provided ($-0.30$ to $-1.36$ kcal/mol) are realistic for individual non-covalent interactions like hydrogen bonds or hydrophobic contacts. The resulting fold-changes in $K_i$ are of a magnitude commonly observed in drug resistance studies.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. There are no identifiable flaws. The problem is **valid**.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds by relating the change in the Gibbs free energy of binding ($\\Delta G_{bind}$) to the inhibition constant ($K_i$). The fundamental thermodynamic relationship is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{bind} = -RT \\ln(K_a) = RT \\ln(K_d) $$\nSince the inhibition constant $K_i$ is a type of dissociation constant, we have:\n$$ \\Delta G_{bind} = RT \\ln(K_i) $$\nwhere $R$ is the ideal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nA mutation that disrupts a favorable binding interaction will increase (make less negative) the binding free energy. Let $\\Delta G_{WT}$ be the binding free energy for the wild-type enzyme and $\\Delta G_{M}$ be the energy for the mutant. The change in free energy due to the mutation is $\\Delta \\Delta G = \\Delta G_M - \\Delta G_{WT}$.\n\nThe problem states that a mutation eliminates a specific favorable energy contribution, let's call it $\\Delta G_{contrib}$. The total wild-type binding energy can be written as $\\Delta G_{WT} = \\Delta G_{base} + \\Delta G_{contrib}$, where $\\Delta G_{base}$ represents all other contributions. The mutation eliminates $\\Delta G_{contrib}$, so the mutant binding energy is $\\Delta G_{M} = \\Delta G_{base}$.\nTherefore, the change in binding free energy is:\n$$ \\Delta \\Delta G = \\Delta G_M - \\Delta G_{WT} = \\Delta G_{base} - (\\Delta G_{base} + \\Delta G_{contrib}) = -\\Delta G_{contrib} $$\nSince the contributions given are favorable, their values are negative, so $\\Delta \\Delta G$ will be positive, corresponding to weaker binding.\n\nThe fold-increase in $K_i$ is the ratio $\\frac{K_{i, M}}{K_{i, WT}}$. We can relate this to $\\Delta \\Delta G$:\n$$ \\Delta \\Delta G = \\Delta G_M - \\Delta G_{WT} = RT \\ln(K_{i, M}) - RT \\ln(K_{i, WT}) = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_{i, M}}{K_{i, WT}}\\right) $$\nRearranging for the fold-increase gives:\n$$ \\frac{K_{i, M}}{K_{i, WT}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\Delta G}{RT}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta G_{contrib}}{RT}\\right) $$\nFirst, we must calculate the value of the term $RT$ in units of kcal/mol.\nGiven $T = 298$ K and using the gas constant $R \\approx 1.987 \\times 10^{-3}$ kcal mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$:\n$$ RT = (1.987 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ kcal mol}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}) \\times (298 \\text{ K}) \\approx 0.592 \\text{ kcal/mol} $$\n\nNow, we can analyze each mutation for each inhibitor.\n\n**1. H274Y Mutation**\nThis mutation eliminates the hydrophobic pocket contribution ($\\Delta G_{HP}$).\n\n- **Oseltamivir**: The lost contribution is $\\Delta G_{contrib} = \\Delta G_{HP, osel} = -1.36$ kcal/mol.\n  The change in binding energy is $\\Delta \\Delta G = -(-1.36 \\text{ kcal/mol}) = +1.36$ kcal/mol.\n  The fold-increase in $K_i$ is:\n  $$ \\frac{K_{i, M}}{K_{i, WT}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1.36}{0.592}\\right) \\approx \\exp(2.297) \\approx 9.94 $$\n  This is approximately a $10$-fold increase in $K_i$.\n\n- **Zanamivir**: The lost contribution is $\\Delta G_{contrib} = \\Delta G_{HP, zana} = 0.00$ kcal/mol.\n  The change in binding energy is $\\Delta \\Delta G = -(0.00 \\text{ kcal/mol}) = 0.00$ kcal/mol.\n  The fold-increase in $K_i$ is:\n  $$ \\frac{K_{i, M}}{K_{i, WT}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{0.00}{0.592}\\right) = \\exp(0) = 1 $$\n  This is a $1$-fold increase, meaning no change in $K_i$.\n\n**2. E119V Mutation**\nThis mutation eliminates the glutamate-$119$ contribution ($\\Delta G_{E119}$).\n\n- **Oseltamivir**: The lost contribution is $\\Delta G_{contrib} = \\Delta G_{E119, osel} = -0.30$ kcal/mol.\n  The change in binding energy is $\\Delta \\Delta G = -(-0.30 \\text{ kcal/mol}) = +0.30$ kcal/mol.\n  The fold-increase in $K_i$ is:\n  $$ \\frac{K_{i, M}}{K_{i, WT}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{0.30}{0.592}\\right) \\approx \\exp(0.5067) \\approx 1.66 $$\n  This is approximately a $1.7$-fold increase in $K_i$.\n\n- **Zanamivir**: The lost contribution is $\\Delta G_{contrib} = \\Delta G_{E119, zana} = -1.20$ kcal/mol.\n  The change in binding energy is $\\Delta \\Delta G = -(-1.20 \\text{ kcal/mol}) = +1.20$ kcal/mol.\n  The fold-increase in $K_i$ is:\n  $$ \\frac{K_{i, M}}{K_{i, WT}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1.20}{0.592}\\right) \\approx \\exp(2.027) \\approx 7.59 $$\n  This is approximately a $7$-$8$-fold increase in $K_i$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. H274Y increases oseltamivir $K_i$ by approximately $10$-fold but leaves zanamivir essentially unchanged (approximately $1$-fold) because the collapsed hydrophobic pocket selectively penalizes oseltamivir’s pentyl ether; E119V increases oseltamivir $K_i$ modestly (approximately $1.7$-fold) but increases zanamivir $K_i$ more (approximately $7$-$8$-fold) by removing a key glutamate-$119$ interaction favored by zanamivir’s guanidino group.**\n- **H274Y effect**: Predicts $\\approx 10$-fold increase for oseltamivir and $\\approx 1$-fold for zanamivir. This matches our calculations of $9.94$ and $1.0$, respectively. The structural explanation is correct according to the problem statement; oseltamivir has the pentyl ether that uses the pocket, zanamivir does not.\n- **E119V effect**: Predicts $\\approx 1.7$-fold increase for oseltamivir and $\\approx 7$-$8$-fold for zanamivir. This matches our calculations of $1.66$ and $7.59$, respectively. The structural explanation is also correct; zanamivir relies more heavily on the Glu$119$ interaction than oseltamivir due to its guanidino group.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. H274Y increases zanamivir $K_i$ more (approximately $10$-fold) than oseltamivir (approximately $1$-fold) because zanamivir depends on the hydrophobic pocket; E119V affects both inhibitors equally (approximately $7$-$8$-fold) because both rely similarly on glutamate-$119$.**\n- **H274Y effect**: This statement incorrectly reverses the effects on the two inhibitors. The premise that zanamivir depends on the hydrophobic pocket contradicts the information given in the problem.\n- **E119V effect**: This statement claims equal effects, which contradicts our calculation showing a much larger effect on zanamivir than on oseltamivir.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. H274Y produces approximately $6.7$-fold resistance to oseltamivir and approximately $10$-fold to zanamivir, since both use the hydrophobic pocket; E119V has negligible effect on zanamivir (approximately $1$-fold) but causes approximately $10$-fold resistance to oseltamivir due to loss of a key salt bridge.**\n- **H274Y effect**: The numerical values are incorrect for both inhibitors. The claim that both use the hydrophobic pocket is factually wrong based on the problem statement.\n- **E119V effect**: This statement incorrectly reverses the effects on the two inhibitors and provides an incorrect magnitude of resistance for oseltamivir.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. H274Y has no meaningful effect on either inhibitor because it is outside the catalytic residues; E119V strongly disrupts binding of both inhibitors by approximately $10$-fold because glutamate-$119$ is essential for all neuraminidase inhibitor interactions.**\n- **H274Y effect**: This is incorrect. H274Y has a very meaningful ($10$-fold) effect on oseltamivir. The argument about its location being \"outside the catalytic residues\" is a red herring; the problem explicitly states its role in forming the binding pocket.\n- **E119V effect**: The effect on oseltamivir is modest ($1.7$-fold), not strong. The effect on zanamivir is strong but closer to $7$-$8$-fold, not $10$-fold. The claim that it is essential for \"all\" inhibitors is an overstatement and does not match the provided energy values.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4926899"}, {"introduction": "Antiviral drugs can achieve the same goal of suppressing a virus through vastly different mechanisms, such as blocking viral replication versus preventing its spread between cells.

It is a standard pharmacokinetic calculation grounded in established principles. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe primary goal is to find a new dose, $D_{imp}$, for a patient with impaired renal function that yields the same Area Under the Curve, $AUC_{imp}$, as the standard dose, $D_{norm}$, in a patient with normal renal function, $AUC_{norm}$. The dosing interval remains constant.\nThe condition is:\n$$AUC_{imp} = AUC_{norm}$$\nAccording to the problem statement, a drug's AUC is proportional to the dose divided by total clearance. Let the proportionality constant be $k$ and the oral bioavailability be $F$.\n$$AUC_i = k \\frac{F \\cdot D_i}{CL_{total, i}}$$\nApplying the target condition:\n$$k \\frac{F \\cdot D_{imp}}{CL_{total, imp}} = k \\frac{F \\cdot D_{norm}}{CL_{total, norm}}$$\nSince the bioavailability $F$ is assumed to be unchanged and $k$ is a constant, they cancel out, leaving:\n$$\\frac{D_{imp}}{CL_{total, imp}} = \\frac{D_{norm}}{CL_{total, norm}}$$\nSolving for the adjusted dose, $D_{imp}$:\n$$D_{imp} = D_{norm} \\left( \\frac{CL_{total, imp}}{CL_{total, norm}} \\right)$$\nThe core of the problem is to determine the ratio of total clearance in the impaired patient to that in the normal patient.\n\nTotal body clearance, $CL_{total}$, is the sum of renal clearance, $CL_R$, and nonrenal clearance, $CL_{NR}$:\n$$CL_{total} = CL_R + CL_{NR}$$\nFor a patient with normal renal function, we have:\n$$CL_{total, norm} = CL_{R, norm} + CL_{NR, norm}$$\nThe fraction of the drug eliminated by the kidneys in a subject with normal renal function is given as $f_e = 0.90$.\n$$f_e = \\frac{CL_{R, norm}}{CL_{total, norm}}$$\nFrom this, we can express the renal and nonrenal clearance components for a normal individual in terms of total clearance:\n$$CL_{R, norm} = f_e \\cdot CL_{total, norm}$$\n$$CL_{NR, norm} = CL_{total, norm} - CL_{R, norm} = CL_{total, norm} - (f_e \\cdot CL_{total, norm}) = (1 - f_e) \\cdot CL_{total, norm}$$\nThe problem states that nonrenal clearance does not depend on creatinine clearance. Therefore, it is constant for both patients:\n$$CL_{NR, imp} = CL_{NR, norm} = (1 - f_e) \\cdot CL_{total, norm}$$\nThe problem also states that renal clearance is proportional to creatinine clearance ($CrCl$). Let $c$ be the constant of proportionality.\n$$CL_R = c \\cdot CrCl$$\nThis implies a direct linear relationship. We can therefore write the ratio of the renal clearances for the two patients:\n$$\\frac{CL_{R, imp}}{CL_{R, norm}} = \\frac{c \\cdot CrCl_{imp}}{c \\cdot CrCl_{norm}} = \\frac{CrCl_{imp}}{CrCl_{norm}}$$\nSo, the renal clearance in the impaired patient is:\n$$CL_{R, imp} = CL_{R, norm} \\left( \\frac{CrCl_{imp}}{CrCl_{norm}} \\right) = (f_e \\cdot CL_{total, norm}) \\left( \\frac{CrCl_{imp}}{CrCl_{norm}} \\right)$$\nNow, we can assemble the expression for the total clearance in the impaired patient, $CL_{total, imp}$:\n$$CL_{total, imp} = CL_{R, imp} + CL_{NR, imp}$$\n$$CL_{total, imp} = \\left(f_e \\cdot CL_{total, norm} \\cdot \\frac{CrCl_{imp}}{CrCl_{norm}}\\right) + \\left((1 - f_e) \\cdot CL_{total, norm}\\right)$$\nFactoring out $CL_{total, norm}$:\n$$CL_{total, imp} = CL_{total, norm} \\left( f_e \\frac{CrCl_{imp}}{CrCl_{norm}} + (1 - f_e) \\right)$$\nThe required ratio of clearances is:\n$$\\frac{CL_{total, imp}}{CL_{total, norm}} = f_e \\frac{CrCl_{imp}}{CrCl_{norm}} + (1 - f_e)$$\nWe are given the following values:\n-   $D_{norm} = 75\\ \\mathrm{mg}$\n-   $f_e = 0.90$\n-   $CrCl_{norm} = 100\\ \\mathrm{mL/min}$\n-   $CrCl_{imp} = 30\\ \\mathrm{mL/min}$\n\nSubstitute these values into the clearance ratio expression:\n$$\\frac{CL_{total, imp}}{CL_{total, norm}} = (0.90) \\left( \\frac{30}{100} \\right) + (1 - 0.90)$$\n$$\\frac{CL_{total, imp}}{CL_{total, norm}} = (0.90)(0.30) + 0.10$$\n$$\\frac{CL_{total, imp}}{CL_{total, norm}} = 0.27 + 0.10 = 0.37$$\nFinally, calculate the adjusted dose, $D_{imp}$:\n$$D_{imp} = D_{norm} \\left( \\frac{CL_{total, imp}}{CL_{total, norm}} \\right)$$\n$$D_{imp} = 75\\ \\mathrm{mg} \\times 0.37$$\n$$D_{imp} = 27.75\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The result $27.75$ already has four significant figures.\nThe adjusted dose to maintain the same AUC is $27.75\\ \\mathrm{mg}$ per administration.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{27.75}\n$$", "id": "4926862"}]}
