It presents a standard pharmacokinetic calculation based on a one-compartment model, which is a fundamental concept in pharmacology. The drug mentioned, metronidazole, and its clinical use for amebiasis are correct. The provided pharmacokinetic parameters, such as the bioavailability ($F=1$ is a valid simplifying assumption for metronidazole's high oral bioavailability, which is typically $>90\\%$) and the apparent volume of distribution ($V_d = 0.6$ $\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{kg}$ is a textbook value), are realistic.\n\nThe problem is well-posed and self-contained. It provides all necessary information to calculate the requested quantity, $C_{max}$. The assumptions of instantaneous absorption and distribution are standard simplifications for intravenous bolus models, and the problem explicitly states to apply them to this oral dosing scenario, effectively treating it as an I.V. bolus for the purpose of calculating $C_{max}$. This makes the problem solvable with a unique, meaningful answer. There are no contradictions; the dosing interval of $8$ $\\mathrm{h}$ is extraneous information for calculating the peak concentration after a single dose but does not invalidate the problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe fundamental relationship in pharmacokinetics defining the concentration of a drug in plasma is given by the ratio of the amount of drug in the body to the apparent volume of distribution. The maximum plasma concentration, $C_{max}$, is achieved when the amount of drug in the body is at its peak.\n\nThe problem states to assume rapid absorption such that the peak concentration occurs immediately after the dose enters the systemic circulation. This allows us to calculate $C_{max}$ using the initial concentration ($C_0$) formula for a single intravenous bolus dose. The initial concentration is defined as:\n$$\nC_0 = \\frac{\\text{Amount of drug in the body at time zero}}{V_d}\n$$\nThe amount of drug that enters the systemic circulation is the administered dose, $D$, multiplied by the bioavailability, $F$. Therefore, the amount of drug in the body immediately after administration is $F \\times D$. Under the given assumptions, $C_{max}$ is equivalent to $C_0$:\n$$\nC_{max} = C_0 = \\frac{F \\times D}{V_d}\n$$\nFirst, we must calculate the total dose, $D$, and the total volume of distribution, $V_d$, for this specific child.\n\nThe child's weight, $W$, is given as $30$ $\\mathrm{kg}$.\nThe prescribed dose is $7.5$ $\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}$. The total dose, $D$, is:\n$$\nD = (7.5 \\text{ } \\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}) \\times W = (7.5 \\text{ } \\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}) \\times (30 \\text{ } \\mathrm{kg}) = 225 \\text{ } \\mathrm{mg}\n$$\nThe apparent volume of distribution per kilogram is given as $0.6$ $\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{kg}$. The total volume of distribution, $V_d$, for the child is:\n$$\nV_d = (0.6 \\text{ } \\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{kg}) \\times W = (0.6 \\text{ } \\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{kg}) \\times (30 \\text{ } \\mathrm{kg}) = 18 \\text{ } \\mathrm{L}\n$$\nThe bioavailability, $F$, is given as $1$.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the equation for $C_{max}$:\n$$\nC_{max} = \\frac{F \\times D}{V_d} = \\frac{1 \\times 225 \\text{ } \\mathrm{mg}}{18 \\text{ } \\mathrm{L}}\n$$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$\nC_{max} = 12.5 \\text{ } \\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. To express $12.5$ with four significant figures, we write it as $12.50$.\nThus, the expected maximum plasma concentration immediately after a single dose is $12.50$ $\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{12.50}\n$$", "id": "4917702"}, {"introduction": "While peak concentration is important, a drug's overall effectiveness often depends on the total exposure the body receives over time.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n-   **Action**: Proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe solution is derived from two first principles as specified: mass balance at steady state and the fundamental definition of clearance.\n\n1.  **Mass Balance at Steady State**: At steady state, the amount of drug entering the systemic circulation over a defined time window is equal to the amount of drug eliminated from the body over the same time window.\n\n2.  **Definition of Clearance ($CL$)**: Clearance is the proportionality constant that relates the rate of drug elimination to the drug's plasma concentration, $C(t)$.\n    $$ \\text{Rate of Elimination}(t) = CL \\cdot C(t) $$\n\nWe need to find the Area Under the Curve over a $24$-hour period at steady state, denoted as $AUC_{0-24, ss}$. We will apply the principle of mass balance over this $24$-hour window.\n\nThe total amount of drug eliminated over the $24$-hour period is the integral of the rate of elimination over this time:\n$$ \\text{Amount Eliminated}_{0-24} = \\int_{0}^{24} \\text{Rate of Elimination}(t) \\,dt = \\int_{0}^{24} CL \\cdot C_{ss}(t) \\,dt $$\nSince clearance $CL$ is assumed to be constant (a feature of linear pharmacokinetics), it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$ \\text{Amount Eliminated}_{0-24} = CL \\cdot \\int_{0}^{24} C_{ss}(t) \\,dt $$\nThe integral $\\int_{0}^{24} C_{ss}(t) \\,dt$ is, by definition, the area under the concentration-time curve from $t=0$ to $t=24$ at steady state, $AUC_{0-24, ss}$. Thus, we arrive at a key symbolic relationship for the amount eliminated:\n$$ \\text{Amount Eliminated}_{0-24} = CL \\cdot AUC_{0-24, ss} $$\n\nNext, we determine the total amount of drug that enters the systemic circulation over the same $24$-hour period.\nThe dosing regimen is a $Dose = 500$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ administered every $\\tau = 8$ $\\mathrm{h}$.\nThe number of doses, $N$, in a $24$-hour period is:\n$$ N = \\frac{24 \\text{ h}}{8 \\text{ h/dose}} = 3 \\text{ doses} $$\nThe total administered dose over $24$ hours, $Dose_{total, 24h}$, is:\n$$ Dose_{total, 24h} = N \\cdot Dose = 3 \\cdot 500 \\text{ mg} = 1500 \\text{ mg} $$\nThe amount of drug that actually reaches the systemic circulation (is absorbed) is this total dose multiplied by the bioavailability, $F$.\n$$ \\text{Amount Absorbed}_{0-24} = F \\cdot Dose_{total, 24h} $$\n\nAccording to the principle of mass balance at steady state, the amount absorbed must equal the amount eliminated over the $24$-hour period:\n$$ \\text{Amount Absorbed}_{0-24} = \\text{Amount Eliminated}_{0-24} $$\nSubstituting the expressions we derived:\n$$ F \\cdot Dose_{total, 24h} = CL \\cdot AUC_{0-24, ss} $$\nThis is the central symbolic relationship required. We can now solve for $AUC_{0-24, ss}$:\n$$ AUC_{0-24, ss} = \\frac{F \\cdot Dose_{total, 24h}}{CL} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n-   $F = 1$ (dimensionless)\n-   $Dose_{total, 24h} = 1500$ $\\mathrm{mg}$\n-   $CL = 3$ $\\mathrm{L/h}$\n\n$$ AUC_{0-24, ss} = \\frac{1 \\cdot 1500 \\text{ mg}}{3 \\text{ L/h}} = 500 \\text{ mg} \\cdot \\text{h/L} $$\nThe problem requires rounding to three significant figures. The exact value $500$ is written as $5.00 \\times 10^2$ to unambiguously show three significant figures.\n\nThe second part of the problem is to compute the ratio $AUC_{0-24}/MIC$.\n-   $AUC_{0-24} = 500 \\text{ mg} \\cdot \\text{h/L}$\n-   $MIC = 1 \\text{ mg/L}$\n\n$$ \\frac{AUC_{0-24}}{MIC} = \\frac{500 \\text{ mg} \\cdot \\text{h/L}}{1 \\text{ mg/L}} = 500 \\text{ h} $$\nThe problem specifies to report this as a pure number. This is interpreted as reporting the numerical magnitude of the result. The numerical value is $500$.\nRounding to three significant figures, this is also $5.00 \\times 10^2$.\n\nThe two required values are $AUC_{0-24} = 5.00 \\times 10^2 \\text{ mg} \\cdot \\text{h/L}$ and the ratio $AUC_{0-24}/MIC = 5.00 \\times 10^2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 5.00 \\times 10^{2} & 5.00 \\times 10^{2} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4917721"}, {"introduction": "A patient's response to a drug is not static; it can be altered by other medications or underlying diseases.
