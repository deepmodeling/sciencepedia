Let uninfected target cells be $T(t)$ and plasma virus be $V(t)$. Before therapy, infection dynamics are governed by well-tested compartmental equations and parameterizations: infection rate constant $\\beta$, production rates $p_{s}$ and $p_{l}$ for $I_{s}$ and $I_{l}$, death rates $\\delta_{s}$ and $\\delta_{l}$ for $I_{s}$ and $I_{l}$, and free-virus clearance rate $c$.

According to the steady-state concentration formula ($C_{\\text{ss,avg}} \\propto 1/CL$), reduced clearance will cause drug concentrations to accumulate to levels higher than in a normal metabolizer.\n4.  **Clinical Observation:** The patient's trough concentration ($C_{\\min}$) is $5.2\\ \\mu\\text{g/mL}$, which is well above the neurotoxicity threshold of $4.0\\ \\mu\\text{g/mL}$. This elevated concentration explains the reported neuropsychiatric symptoms (vivid dreams, dizziness, anxiety), as CNS exposure scales with plasma concentration.\n5.  **Therapeutic Goal:** The intervention should aim to lower the plasma concentration into the therapeutic range (efficacious but not toxic).\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\n**A. Correct.** This option accurately follows the logical sequence described above. It correctly identifies that the CYP2B6 *6/*6 genotype reduces metabolic clearance, leading to increased plasma concentrations ($C_{\\min} = 5.2\\ \\mu\\text{g/mL}$) that exceed the neurotoxicity threshold ($4.0\\ \\mu\\text{g/mL}$) and cause symptoms. The proposed interventions—dose reduction (e.g., to $400$ mg) or switching to an alternative drug class, followed by repeat TDM—are the standard, evidence-based management strategies for this exact scenario.\n\n**B. Incorrect.** This option is flawed because genetic polymorphisms in metabolic enzymes affect clearance ($CL$), not primarily the volume of distribution ($V_d$). Furthermore, an increased $V_d$ would lead to *lower* plasma concentrations, contradicting the measured high $C_{\\min}$. Splitting the dose would not solve the problem of excessive total drug exposure due to low clearance.\n\n**C. Incorrect.** While CYP3A4 has a minor role in efavirenz metabolism, the primary cause of toxicity in a known CYP2B6 *6/*6 slow metabolizer is the defect in CYP2B6. Attributing the effect to a hypothetical CYP3A4 polymorphism is incorrect. Adding a CYP3A4 inducer is a crude and potentially dangerous approach that could lead to unpredictable drug levels.\n\n**D. Incorrect.** This option correctly states that reduced first-pass metabolism can increase bioavailability ($F$), which is a contributing factor. However, it makes two critical errors: it claims TDM is not needed, which is false, and it claims symptoms are unrelated to plasma concentration, which directly contradicts the well-established concentration-toxicity relationship provided in the problem.\n\n**E. Incorrect.** The primary mechanism of toxicity is impaired systemic metabolism (a CYP2B6 issue), not impaired efflux at the blood-brain barrier (a P-gp issue). The proposed intervention is also pharmacokinetically wrong; for a once-daily drug, increasing the dosing frequency (e.g., to twice daily) while keeping the total daily dose the same would *raise* the trough concentration ($C_{\\min}$), worsening the toxicity.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the only scientifically sound explanation and appropriate clinical plan.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4925735"}]}
