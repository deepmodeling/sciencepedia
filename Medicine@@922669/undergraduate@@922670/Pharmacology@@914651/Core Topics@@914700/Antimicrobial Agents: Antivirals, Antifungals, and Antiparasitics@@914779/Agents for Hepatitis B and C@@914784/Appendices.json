It is based on fundamental principles of pharmacokinetics and provides a complete and consistent set of data and definitions for its solution. Therefore, a full solution is provided below.\n\n### Task 1: Derivation of the Expression for $C_{ss,\\text{avg}}$\n\nThe derivation begins from the fundamental principle of mass balance at steady state. For a drug administered in multiple doses, steady state is the condition where the amount of drug entering the body over a dosing interval is equal to the amount of drug eliminated from the body over the same interval. This can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\text{Average Rate of Drug Input} = \\text{Average Rate of Drug Elimination}\n$$\n\nThe problem statement provides definitions to formalize both sides of this equality.\n\n**1. Average Rate of Drug Input:**\nFor an oral dose $D$ administered every $\\tau$ time units, not all of the dose may reach the systemic circulation due to incomplete absorption and/or first-pass metabolism. The fraction that reaches the systemic circulation is the oral bioavailability, $F$. The total amount of drug entering the systemic circulation per dosing interval is thus $F \\times D$. The average rate of input over the dosing interval $\\tau$ is therefore given by:\n$$\n\\text{Average Rate of Input} = \\frac{F \\times D}{\\tau}\n$$\n\n**2. Average Rate of Drug Elimination:**\nThe problem defines systemic clearance, $CL$, as the constant of proportionality relating the rate of elimination to the plasma concentration, $C(t)$:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Elimination}(t) = CL \\times C(t)\n$$\nThis relationship holds for linear pharmacokinetics, as assumed. The average rate of elimination over a dosing interval from time $t_1$ to $t_1 + \\tau$ is the integral of the instantaneous rate of elimination divided by the duration of the interval:\n$$\n\\text{Average Rate of Elimination} = \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\int_{t_1}^{t_1+\\tau} \\text{Rate of Elimination}(t) \\, dt = \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\int_{t_1}^{t_1+\\tau} CL \\times C(t) \\, dt\n$$\nSince clearance $CL$ is a constant, it can be moved outside the integral:\n$$\n\\text{Average Rate of Elimination} = CL \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\int_{t_1}^{t_1+\\tau} C(t) \\, dt \\right)\n$$\nThe term in the parentheses is, by definition, the average steady-state plasma concentration over the dosing interval, $C_{ss,\\text{avg}}$. Thus:\n$$\n\\text{Average Rate of Elimination} = CL \\times C_{ss,\\text{avg}}\n$$\n\n**3. Equating Rates and Solving for $C_{ss,\\text{avg}}$:**\nBy equating the average rate of input with the average rate of output at steady state, we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{F \\times D}{\\tau} = CL \\times C_{ss,\\text{avg}}\n$$\nSolving for $C_{ss,\\text{avg}}$ yields the desired general expression:\n$$\nC_{ss,\\text{avg}} = \\frac{F \\times D}{CL \\times \\tau}\n$$\n\n### Task 2: Application to Renal Impairment\n\nThe derived expression shows that the average steady-state concentration is directly proportional to the dose $D$ and bioavailability $F$, and inversely proportional to the systemic clearance $CL$ and the dosing interval $\\tau$.\n\n**1. Calculating the Fold-Change Ratio $R$:**\nWe are asked to compute the ratio $R$, defined as:\n$$\nR = \\frac{C_{ss,\\text{avg}}(\\text{impaired})}{C_{ss,\\text{avg}}(\\text{normal})}\n$$\nUsing the derived formula, we can write the expressions for the average steady-state concentration in patients with normal and impaired renal function.\n\nFor a patient with normal renal function, the clearance is $CL_{\\text{normal}}$:\n$$\nC_{ss,\\text{avg}}(\\text{normal}) = \\frac{F \\times D}{CL_{\\text{normal}} \\times \\tau}\n$$\n\nFor a patient with moderate renal impairment, the clearance is reduced to $CL_{\\text{imp}}$. The problem states that the dose $D$, bioavailability $F$, and dosing interval $\\tau$ remain unchanged:\n$$\nC_{ss,\\text{avg}}(\\text{impaired}) = \\frac{F \\times D}{CL_{\\text{imp}} \\times \\tau}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{F \\times D}{CL_{\\text{imp}} \\times \\tau}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{F \\times D}{CL_{\\text{normal}} \\times \\tau}\\right)}\n$$\nThe terms $F$, $D$, and $\\tau$ are common to both the numerator and the denominator, and thus cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n$$\nR = \\frac{CL_{\\text{normal}}}{CL_{\\text{imp}}}\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that the fold-change in average steady-state concentration is equal to the inverse of the fold-change in clearance.\n\nThe problem states that for moderate renal impairment, $CL_{\\text{imp}} = 0.55 \\times CL_{\\text{normal}}$. Substituting this relationship into the expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{CL_{\\text{normal}}}{0.55 \\times CL_{\\text{normal}}}\n$$\nThe term $CL_{\\text{normal}}$ cancels, leaving a purely numerical ratio:\n$$\nR = \\frac{1}{0.55}\n$$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$\nR \\approx 1.818181...\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, as requested, we get:\n$$\nR \\approx 1.82\n$$\n\n**2. Pharmacological Rationale:**\nTenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is a prodrug of tenofovir, which is primarily eliminated from the body by the kidneys through a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. Systemic clearance ($CL$) is the sum of clearance by all organs, but for a drug like tenofovir, renal clearance ($CL_R$) is the major component of systemic clearance ($CL \\approx CL_R$). Renal impairment, which signifies a decline in kidney function, directly leads to a reduction in the renal clearance of drugs. Consequently, the systemic clearance of tenofovir is significantly reduced.\n\nAs shown by the derived relationship $C_{ss,\\text{avg}} = \\frac{F \\times D}{CL \\times \\tau}$, a decrease in $CL$ with an unchanged dosing regimen ($F, D, \\tau$) will cause a proportional increase in the average steady-state plasma concentration. This increased drug exposure can heighten the risk of concentration-dependent adverse effects, such as nephrotoxicity, which is a known concern with tenofovir. Therefore, in clinical practice, the dose or the dosing interval for renally eliminated drugs like TDF is adjusted in patients with renal impairment to maintain drug exposure within the therapeutic window and avoid toxicity. The calculated fold-change $R \\approx 1.82$ quantifies this increase in exposure, suggesting that drug accumulation will be nearly $82\\%$ higher in a patient with moderate renal impairment if the standard dosing regimen is continued.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.82}$$", "id": "4918148"}, {"introduction": "Having established how drug clearance impacts steady-state levels, we now turn our attention to the initial step of absorption, which can be equally complex. Many modern oral antivirals have specific solubility requirements, creating the potential for significant drug-drug interactions that occur before the drug even reaches systemic circulation. This exercise [@problem_id:4918219] challenges you to apply biopharmaceutical principles to model how a common medication like a proton pump inhibitor can alter gastric pH, dramatically reducing the solubility and bioavailability of weakly basic drugs like ledipasvir and velpatasvir, thereby providing a mechanistic basis for this clinically vital interaction.", "problem": "A patient with chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection is prescribed either ledipasvir or velpatasvir, two nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitors known to have pH-dependent solubility. The patient is also taking high-dose omeprazole, a Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI), which elevates gastric pH. You will model how PPI-induced increases in gastric pH reduce absorption and therefore exposure, quantified by the Area Under the Curve (AUC). Use the following scientifically grounded bases:\n\n- Henderson–Hasselbalch behavior for a monoprotic weak base: total solubility increases with protonation and follows $$S_{\\text{tot}}(pH) = S_{0}\\left(1 + 10^{pK_{a} - pH}\\right),$$ where $S_{0}$ is the intrinsic solubility of the neutral form and $pK_{a}$ is the acid dissociation constant of the base.\n\n- In dissolution-limited absorption, the bioavailable fraction $F$ is saturable with respect to solubility and can be modeled over the gastric phase by $$F(pH) = F_{\\max}\\cdot \\frac{S_{\\text{tot}}(pH)}{S_{\\text{tot}}(pH) + K},$$ where $F_{\\max}$ is the maximal fraction absorbed when luminal solubility is not limiting, and $K$ is a lumped solubilization constant reflecting luminal volume and micellar/bile-mediated solubilization capacity.\n\n- Under the assumption that oral clearance is unchanged by PPI, $$\\text{AUC} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL}$$ implies that the AUC ratio between two conditions is equal to the ratio of the corresponding bioavailable fractions.\n\nConsider two scenarios for the same patient, with all other variables held constant except the drug:\n\n1. Ledipasvir parameters: $pK_{a} = 5.0$, $S_{0} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-2}$ mg/mL, $F_{\\max} = 0.90$, $K = 3.6736 \\times 10^{-2}$ mg/mL.\n\n2. Velpatasvir parameters: $pK_{a} = 5.2$, $S_{0} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2}$ mg/mL, $F_{\\max} = 0.95$, $K = 2.3204 \\times 10^{-2}$ mg/mL.\n\nAssume the pre-dose basal gastric $pH$ is $2.0$, and under high-dose omeprazole the average gastric $pH$ is $6.0$ during the relevant dissolution-absorption window. Using the principles above:\n\n- Describe mechanistically how raising $pH$ reduces absorption for these weakly basic NS5A inhibitors (link $pH$ to ionization to solubility to dissolution-limited $F$).\n- Then derive and calculate, for each drug, the ratio $$R = \\frac{\\text{AUC}_{\\text{omeprazole}}}{\\text{AUC}_{\\text{baseline}}} = \\frac{F(pH = 6.0)}{F(pH = 2.0)}.$$\n\nRound each $R$ to three significant figures, and express the final answer as a row matrix in the order ledipasvir then velpatasvir. The answer is unitless and must be written as decimal fractions.", "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of pharmacokinetics and biopharmaceutics, well-posed with all necessary parameters and equations provided, and objective in its language. The models, parameters, and physiological conditions are consistent with scientific literature regarding pH-dependent drug-drug interactions involving weakly basic drugs and proton pump inhibitors.\n\nThe task is twofold: first, to mechanistically describe how an increase in gastric $pH$ reduces the absorption of weakly basic drugs like ledipasvir and velpatasvir, and second, to calculate the reduction in exposure (AUC) for each drug when co-administered with omeprazole.\n\nFirst, the mechanistic explanation. The drugs in question, ledipasvir and velpatasvir, are weak bases. A weak base, denoted as $B$, exists in equilibrium with its protonated (conjugate acid) form, $BH^+$, in an aqueous environment. This equilibrium is governed by the $pH$ of the solution and the drug's acid dissociation constant, $pK_a$. The reaction is $B + H^{+} \\rightleftharpoons BH^{+}$. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation quantifies the relationship:\n$$pK_{a} - pH = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[BH^+]}{[B]}\\right)$$\nThis equation shows that in a highly acidic environment (low $pH$, such as the basal gastric $pH$ of $2.0$), the term $pK_{a} - pH$ is positive, leading to a high ratio of $[BH^+]$ to $[B]$. The protonated form, $BH^+$, is an ion and is thus significantly more water-soluble than the neutral, uncharged form, $B$. The total aqueous solubility, $S_{\\text{tot}}$, is the sum of the intrinsic solubility of the neutral form, $S_0$, and the solubility of the protonated form. The provided model, $S_{\\text{tot}}(pH) = S_{0}(1 + 10^{pK_{a} - pH})$, captures this dependence. When the gastric $pH$ is raised from $2.0$ to $6.0$ by omeprazole, the concentration of protons, $[H^+]$, decreases. According to Le Châtelier's principle, the equilibrium $B + H^{+} \\rightleftharpoons BH^{+}$ shifts to the left, favoring the less soluble neutral form $B$. Consequently, the total solubility $S_{\\text{tot}}$ decreases drastically.\n\nAbsorption from the gastrointestinal tract for poorly soluble drugs is often limited by the rate of dissolution. According to the Noyes-Whitney equation, the dissolution rate is directly proportional to the drug's solubility. Therefore, the reduced solubility at elevated $pH$ leads to a slower dissolution rate. This, in turn, reduces the amount of drug available for absorption, quantified by the bioavailable fraction, $F$. The provided model for $F(pH)$ demonstrates that as $S_{\\text{tot}}(pH)$ decreases, $F$ also decreases. Since the Area Under the Curve (AUC) is directly proportional to $F$ (assuming constant dose $D$ and clearance $CL$), a reduction in $F$ leads to a proportional reduction in AUC, signifying decreased systemic drug exposure.\n\nNext, we calculate the ratio $R = \\frac{\\text{AUC}_{\\text{omeprazole}}}{\\text{AUC}_{\\text{baseline}}}$ for each drug. Given that AUC is proportional to $F$, this ratio simplifies to:\n$$R = \\frac{F(pH)}{F(pH_{\\text{baseline}})} = \\frac{F(pH=6.0)}{F(pH=2.0)}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $F(pH)$:\n$$R = \\frac{F_{\\max}\\cdot \\frac{S_{\\text{tot}}(6.0)}{S_{\\text{tot}}(6.0) + K}}{F_{\\max}\\cdot \\frac{S_{\\text{tot}}(2.0)}{S_{\\text{tot}}(2.0) + K}} = \\left(\\frac{S_{\\text{tot}}(6.0)}{S_{\\text{tot}}(6.0) + K}\\right) \\left(\\frac{S_{\\text{tot}}(2.0) + K}{S_{\\text{tot}}(2.0)}\\right)$$\n\nWe will now apply this framework to each drug.\n\nFor ledipasvir:\nThe parameters are $pK_{a} = 5.0$, $S_{0} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-2}$ mg/mL, and $K = 3.6736 \\times 10^{-2}$ mg/mL.\n\nFirst, calculate the total solubility at $pH = 2.0$ and $pH = 6.0$.\nAt baseline $pH = 2.0$:\n$$S_{\\text{tot, Led}}(2.0) = S_{0} \\left(1 + 10^{pK_{a} - 2.0}\\right) = (5.0 \\times 10^{-2}) \\left(1 + 10^{5.0 - 2.0}\\right)$$\n$$S_{\\text{tot, Led}}(2.0) = (5.0 \\times 10^{-2}) \\left(1 + 10^{3}\\right) = 0.05 \\times 1001 = 50.05 \\text{ mg/mL}$$\nAt omeprazole-induced $pH = 6.0$:\n$$S_{\\text{tot, Led}}(6.0) = S_{0} \\left(1 + 10^{pK_{a} - 6.0}\\right) = (5.0 \\times 10^{-2}) \\left(1 + 10^{5.0 - 6.0}\\right)$$\n$$S_{\\text{tot, Led}}(6.0) = (5.0 \\times 10^{-2}) \\left(1 + 10^{-1}\\right) = 0.05 \\times 1.1 = 0.055 \\text{ mg/mL}$$\n\nNow, calculate the ratio $R_{\\text{Led}}$:\n$$R_{\\text{Led}} = \\left(\\frac{0.055}{0.055 + 3.6736 \\times 10^{-2}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{50.05 + 3.6736 \\times 10^{-2}}{50.05}\\right)$$\n$$R_{\\text{Led}} = \\left(\\frac{0.055}{0.091736}\\right) \\left(\\frac{50.086736}{50.05}\\right)$$\n$$R_{\\text{Led}} \\approx (0.599557) \\times (1.000734)$$\n$$R_{\\text{Led}} \\approx 0.599996$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $R_{\\text{Led}} = 0.600$.\n\nFor velpatasvir:\nThe parameters are $pK_{a} = 5.2$, $S_{0} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2}$ mg/mL, and $K = 2.3204 \\times 10^{-2}$ mg/mL.\n\nFirst, calculate the total solubility at $pH = 2.0$ and $pH = 6.0$.\nAt baseline $pH = 2.0$:\n$$S_{\\text{tot, Vel}}(2.0) = S_{0} \\left(1 + 10^{pK_{a} - 2.0}\\right) = (2.0 \\times 10^{-2}) \\left(1 + 10^{5.2 - 2.0}\\right)$$\n$$S_{\\text{tot, Vel}}(2.0) = (2.0 \\times 10^{-2}) \\left(1 + 10^{3.2}\\right) \\approx 0.02 \\times (1 + 1584.89) = 31.71786 \\text{ mg/mL}$$\nAt omeprazole-induced $pH = 6.0$:\n$$S_{\\text{tot, Vel}}(6.0) = S_{0} \\left(1 + 10^{pK_{a} - 6.0}\\right) = (2.0 \\times 10^{-2}) \\left(1 + 10^{5.2 - 6.0}\\right)$$\n$$S_{\\text{tot, Vel}}(6.0) = (2.0 \\times 10^{-2}) \\left(1 + 10^{-0.8}\\right) \\approx 0.02 \\times (1 + 0.158489) = 0.0231698 \\text{ mg/mL}$$\n\nNow, calculate the ratio $R_{\\text{Vel}}$:\n$$R_{\\text{Vel}} = \\left(\\frac{0.0231698}{0.0231698 + 2.3204 \\times 10^{-2}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{31.71786 + 2.3204 \\times 10^{-2}}{31.71786}\\right)$$\n$$R_{\\text{Vel}} = \\left(\\frac{0.0231698}{0.0463738}\\right) \\left(\\frac{31.741064}{31.71786}\\right)$$\n$$R_{\\text{Vel}} \\approx (0.499636) \\times (1.000732)$$\n$$R_{\\text{Vel}} \\approx 0.500000$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $R_{\\text{Vel}} = 0.500$.\n\nThe calculated ratios indicate that under the specified model, co-administration of high-dose omeprazole is predicted to reduce the AUC of ledipasvir to $60.0\\%$ of its baseline value, and the AUC of velpatasvir to $50.0\\%$ of its baseline value.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.600 & 0.500\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4918219"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice integrates the concepts of bioavailability and clearance to tackle one of the most significant challenges in pharmacotherapy: drug-drug interactions caused by enzyme and transporter induction.

The product $f_u \\cdot CL_{int,R}$ is:\n$$ f_u \\cdot CL_{int,R} = 0.10 \\cdot 1500 \\ \\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}} = 150 \\ \\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}} $$\nThe hepatic clearance with rifampin, $CL_{h,R}$, is:\n$$ CL_{h,R} = \\frac{90 \\ \\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}} \\cdot 150 \\ \\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}}}{90 \\ \\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}} + 150 \\ \\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}}} = \\frac{13500}{240} \\ \\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}} = 56.25 \\ \\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}} $$\nThe hepatic bioavailability with rifampin, $F_{h,R}$, is:\n$$ F_{h,R} = 1 - \\frac{CL_{h,R}}{Q_h} = 1 - \\frac{56.25 \\ \\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}}}{90 \\ \\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}}} = 1 - 0.625 = 0.375 $$\n\nNow we can compute the ratios involving the hepatic parameters:\n$$ \\frac{F_{h,R}}{F_{h,0}} = \\frac{0.375}{0.75} = 0.5 $$\n$$ \\frac{CL_{h,0}}{CL_{h,R}} = \\frac{22.5}{56.25} = 0.4 $$\n\nFinally, we substitute all the calculated ratios into the expression for $R$:\n$$ R = \\left(\\frac{F_{a,R}}{F_{a,0}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{F_{g,R}}{F_{g,0}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{F_{h,R}}{F_{h,0}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{CL_{h,0}}{CL_{h,R}}\\right) $$\n$$ R = (0.50) \\cdot (0.70) \\cdot (0.5) \\cdot (0.4) $$\n$$ R = (0.35) \\cdot (0.2) = 0.07 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ R = 0.0700 $$\nThis result indicates that coadministration with rifampin is expected to decrease the steady-state average concentration of the DAA to $7\\%$ of its baseline value, providing a quantitative basis for the contraindication.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0700}$$", "id": "4918190"}]}
