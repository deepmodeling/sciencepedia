The use of the $AUC/MIC$ ratio is a standard metric for evaluating the efficacy of concentration-dependent antibiotics, including rifampicin in the context of tuberculosis.

We can express this relationship mathematically as:\n$$AUC = k \\cdot D$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality. This constant amalgamates patient-specific parameters such as bioavailability ($F$) and clearance ($CL$), i.e., $k = \\frac{F}{CL}$. The problem states that both bioavailability and clearance are constant, which validates that $k$ is a constant.\n\nUsing this relationship, we can express the current and new $AUC$ values in terms of their respective doses:\n$$AUC_{current} = k \\cdot D_{current}$$\n$$AUC_{new} = k \\cdot D_{new}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions back into the equations for the ratios:\n$$R_{current} = \\frac{k \\cdot D_{current}}{MIC} = 60$$\n$$R_{new} = \\frac{k \\cdot D_{new}}{MIC} = 100$$\n\nWe are asked to find the multiplicative factor by which the current dose should be increased. Let this factor be $M$. This factor is the ratio of the new dose to the current dose:\n$$M = \\frac{D_{new}}{D_{current}}$$\n\nTo find this factor, we can take the ratio of $R_{new}$ to $R_{current}$:\n$$\\frac{R_{new}}{R_{current}} = \\frac{\\frac{k \\cdot D_{new}}{MIC}}{\\frac{k \\cdot D_{current}}{MIC}}$$\n\nThe constants $k$ and $MIC$ appear in both the numerator and the denominator, so they cancel out:\n$$\\frac{R_{new}}{R_{current}} = \\frac{D_{new}}{D_{current}}$$\n\nThis establishes that the multiplicative factor $M$ for the dose is equal to the ratio of the target and baseline $AUC/MIC$ values.\n$$M = \\frac{R_{new}}{R_{current}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$M = \\frac{100}{60}$$\n\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $20$:\n$$M = \\frac{100 \\div 20}{60 \\div 20} = \\frac{5}{3}$$\n\nTherefore, the current daily dose must be multiplied by a factor of $\\frac{5}{3}$ to achieve the target $AUC/MIC$ ratio of $100$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{5}{3}}$$", "id": "4926120"}, {"introduction": "Effective drug therapy often requires moving beyond a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach, a concept central to personalized medicine.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the average steady-state drug concentration ($C_{ss,avg}$) and its application to determine a dose adjustment.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for $C_{ss,avg}$. At steady state for a drug administered orally, the rate of drug entering the systemic circulation equals the rate of drug elimination from the body.\n\nThe rate of drug input is the bioavailable dose ($F \\times \\text{Dose}$) averaged over the dosing interval ($\\tau$):\n$$ \\text{Rate in} = \\frac{F \\cdot \\text{Dose}}{\\tau} $$\n\nThe rate of drug elimination, for a linear, first-order process, is the product of the total body clearance ($CL$) and the average steady-state plasma concentration ($C_{ss,avg}$):\n$$ \\text{Rate out} = CL \\cdot C_{ss,avg} $$\n\nEquating the rate in and rate out at steady state:\n$$ \\frac{F \\cdot \\text{Dose}}{\\tau} = CL \\cdot C_{ss,avg} $$\n\nSolving for $C_{ss,avg}$ gives the fundamental relationship:\n$$ C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{F \\cdot \\text{Dose}}{CL \\cdot \\tau} $$\n\nThe problem asks for this expression in terms of $F$, $\\text{Dose}$, $\\tau$, the volume of distribution ($V_d$), and the elimination half-life ($t_{1/2}$). We must relate clearance ($CL$) to $V_d$ and $t_{1/2}$. For a one-compartment model, clearance is related to the elimination rate constant ($k_e$) and the volume of distribution ($V_d$) by:\n$$ CL = k_e \\cdot V_d $$\nThe elimination rate constant ($k_e$) is related to the half-life ($t_{1/2}$) by:\n$$ k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $k_e$ into the equation for $CL$:\n$$ CL = \\frac{\\ln(2) \\cdot V_d}{t_{1/2}} $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $CL$ into the equation for $C_{ss,avg}$:\n$$ C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{F \\cdot \\text{Dose}}{\\left( \\frac{\\ln(2) \\cdot V_d}{t_{1/2}} \\right) \\cdot \\tau} $$\nRearranging this gives the desired expression for $C_{ss,avg}$:\n$$ C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{F \\cdot \\text{Dose} \\cdot t_{1/2}}{V_d \\cdot \\tau \\cdot \\ln(2)} $$\n\nNext, we use this expression to solve the specific problem.\nFirst, we calculate the total apparent volume of distribution ($V_d$) for the patients:\n$$ V_d = V_{d,spec} \\times \\text{weight} = (0.6 \\, \\mathrm{L/kg}) \\cdot (70 \\, \\mathrm{kg}) = 42 \\, \\mathrm{L} $$\n\nThe objective is to find the dose for the fast acetylator ($\\text{Dose}_{fast}$) that yields the same $C_{ss,avg}$ as the slow acetylator ($\\text{Dose}_{slow} = 300 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$).\nLet $C_{ss,avg,slow}$ be the concentration in the slow acetylator and $C_{ss,avg,fast}$ be the concentration in the fast acetylator. The condition is:\n$$ C_{ss,avg,fast} = C_{ss,avg,slow} $$\nUsing the derived formula for each phenotype:\n$$ \\frac{F \\cdot \\text{Dose}_{fast} \\cdot t_{1/2, fast}}{V_d \\cdot \\tau \\cdot \\ln(2)} = \\frac{F \\cdot \\text{Dose}_{slow} \\cdot t_{1/2, slow}}{V_d \\cdot \\tau \\cdot \\ln(2)} $$\nThe parameters $F$, $V_d$, $\\tau$, and $\\ln(2)$ are identical for both scenarios and can be canceled from both sides of the equation. This simplification yields a direct relationship between dose and half-life:\n$$ \\text{Dose}_{fast} \\cdot t_{1/2, fast} = \\text{Dose}_{slow} \\cdot t_{1/2, slow} $$\nThis relationship shows that to maintain the same average exposure, the dose must be adjusted inversely to the half-life. This is because clearance is inversely proportional to half-life ($CL \\propto 1/t_{1/2}$), and dose must be proportional to clearance to maintain a constant concentration ($C_{ss,avg} = (\\text{Rate in}) / CL$).\n\nWe can now solve for the required dose for the fast acetylator, $\\text{Dose}_{fast}$:\n$$ \\text{Dose}_{fast} = \\text{Dose}_{slow} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{t_{1/2, slow}}{t_{1/2, fast}} \\right) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n- $\\text{Dose}_{slow} = 300 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$\n- $t_{1/2, slow} = 3.0 \\, \\mathrm{h}$\n- $t_{1/2, fast} = 1.5 \\, \\mathrm{h}$\n\n$$ \\text{Dose}_{fast} = 300 \\, \\mathrm{mg} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{3.0 \\, \\mathrm{h}}{1.5 \\, \\mathrm{h}} \\right) $$\n$$ \\text{Dose}_{fast} = 300 \\, \\mathrm{mg} \\cdot 2 $$\n$$ \\text{Dose}_{fast} = 600 \\, \\mathrm{mg} $$\n\nThe result is exactly $600$. The problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. As an integer, $600$ can be represented with three significant figures. Thus, the required once-daily dose for the fast acetylator to achieve the same average steady-state concentration is $600 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{600}$$", "id": "4926067"}, {"introduction": "Tuberculosis is almost always treated with a combination of drugs, making the management of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) a critical skill for clinicians.

The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe fundamental relationship in linear pharmacokinetics that connects systemic exposure at steady state, measured as the area under the plasma concentration-time curve over a dosing interval ($AUC_{\\tau, ss}$), to the dose ($D$), oral bioavailability ($F$), and systemic clearance ($CL$) is given by:\n$$AUC_{\\tau, ss} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL}$$\nFor simplicity, we will denote the exposure over a dosing interval as $AUC$.\n\nLet $CL_{base}$ and $AUC_{base}$ represent the baseline clearance and exposure in the absence of rifampin, respectively.

This implies that the new clearance, $CL_{rif}$, is the original baseline clearance plus an additional $80\\%$ of the baseline value. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$CL_{rif} = CL_{base} + (0.80 \\cdot CL_{base})$$\n$$CL_{rif} = (1 + 0.80) \\cdot CL_{base}$$\n$$CL_{rif} = 1.80 \\cdot CL_{base}$$\nThis relationship shows that the clearance is increased by a factor of $1.80$ due to enzyme induction by rifampin.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the ratio of exposure with rifampin to baseline exposure, which is $\\frac{AUC_{rif}}{AUC_{base}}$.
