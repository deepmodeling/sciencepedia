We can proceed with a formal derivation and calculation.\n\nThe objective is to first derive an expression for the insulin secretion rate, $S$, as a function of the free sulfonylurea concentration, $C$, and then to calculate the value of $S$ for a given concentration. The derivation proceeds by linking the chain of events from drug binding to the final physiological response.\n\nFirst, we determine the fractional receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, as a function of the drug concentration, $C$. The problem states that the binding process follows the law of mass action for a single class of noninteracting sites. The equilibrium dissociation constant is given by:\n$$\nK_{d} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}\n$$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of free receptors, $[L]$ is the free ligand concentration, and $[RL]$ is the concentration of the ligand-receptor complex. The total receptor concentration, $[R_T]$, is the sum of free and bound receptors:\n$$\n[R_T] = [R] + [RL]\n$$\nFrom this, we can express the free receptor concentration as $[R] = [R_T] - [RL]$. Substituting this into the expression for $K_d$:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{([R_T] - [RL])[L]}{[RL]}\n$$\nWe rearrange this equation to solve for the concentration of the ligand-receptor complex, $[RL]$:\n$$\nK_d [RL] = ([R_T] - [RL])[L] = [R_T][L] - [RL][L]\n$$\n$$\nK_d [RL] + [RL][L] = [R_T][L]\n$$\n$$\n[RL](K_d + [L]) = [R_T][L]\n$$\n$$\n[RL] = \\frac{[R_T][L]}{K_d + [L]}\n$$\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the ratio of bound receptors to total receptors, $\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R_T]}$.

Therefore, the fractional occupancy as a function of $C$ is:\n$$\n\\theta(C) = \\frac{C}{K_d + C}\n$$\nSecond, we relate the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ to the fractional inhibition of the KATP channel conductance, $E$. The problem states that $E$ is proportional to $\\theta$ and saturates at a maximum value $E_{\\max}$. This implies a linear relationship of the form $E = k \\theta$ for some constant $k$. Since the maximum value of $\\theta$ is $1$ (as $C \\to \\infty$), the maximum value of $E$ is $k$. Given that this maximum is $E_{\\max}$, it follows that $k = E_{\\max}$.

I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires us to trace the sequence of events following the administration of a sulfonylurea drug in a fasting state and identify the primary clinical consequence.\n\n1.  **Drug Binding and Receptor Occupancy:**\n    The problem provides the drug concentration $[D] = 1 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and the dissociation constant $K_{d} = 0.1 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$. We can calculate the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ of the SUR1 receptor.\n    $$ \\theta = \\frac{[D]}{K_{d} + [D]} = \\frac{1 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}}{0.1 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} + 1 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{1}{1.1} \\approx 0.909 $$\n    A fractional occupancy of approximately $91\\%$ indicates that the drug is extensively bound to its target, SUR1, and is expected to exert a strong pharmacological effect.\n\n2.  **Effect on the $K_{\\text{ATP}}$ Channel:**\n    The problem states that the sulfonylurea \"binds to $SUR1$ and stabilizes the closed state of $K_{\\text{ATP}}$ independent of $[\\mathrm{ATP}]$\". The context is a fasting state, where a low intracellular $[\\mathrm{ATP}]$ level would normally favor the open state of the $K_{\\text{ATP}}$ channel. The drug's action \"overrides\" this physiological signal. By binding to SUR1, the drug forces the associated $K_{\\text{ATP}}$ channel into a closed conformation, regardless of the low $[\\mathrm{ATP}]$ level.\n\n3.  **Effect on Membrane Electrophysiology:**\n    -   The total potassium conductance, $g_{K}$, of the $\\beta$-cell membrane is proportional to the number of open $K_{\\text{ATP}}$ channels. Since the sulfonylurea closes these channels, $g_{K}$ is significantly reduced.\n    -   The outward potassium current is given by $I_{K} = g_{K} (V - E_{K})$. A reduction in $g_{K}$ leads to a reduction in the outward, hyperpolarizing $K^{+}$ current.\n    -   In a resting $\\beta$-cell, this outward $K^{+}$ current is the dominant current that keeps the membrane potential $V$ hyperpolarized near the $K^{+}$ equilibrium potential, $E_{K}$ (around $-70 \\ \\text{mV}$ to $-80 \\ \\text{mV}$).\n    -   Reducing this outward positive current causes a net influx of positive charge (or a smaller net efflux), leading to membrane depolarization ( $V$ becomes less negative).\n\n4.  **Downstream Signaling and Insulin Secretion:**\n    -   The problem states that depolarization \"permit[s] voltage-dependent $Ca^{2+}$ channel opening\". As the membrane potential depolarizes to a threshold (typically around $-40 \\ \\text{mV}$ to $-50 \\ \\text{mV}$), these channels open.\n    -   The opening of voltage-dependent $Ca^{2+}$ channels allows $Ca^{2+}$ ions to flow into the cell, down their steep electrochemical gradient.\n    -   The resulting increase in intracellular $[Ca^{2+}]$ is the primary trigger for the fusion of insulin-containing secretory granules with the plasma membrane, a process known as exocytosis.\n    -   Therefore, the sulfonylurea-induced channel closure leads directly to insulin secretion.\n\n5.  **Clinical Consequence:**\n    -   This entire cascade is occurring in a \"fasting state\". In this state, blood glucose levels are already in the low-normal range.\n    -   Insulin's primary physiological role is to lower blood glucose by promoting glucose uptake into peripheral tissues (like muscle and fat) and by suppressing glucose production by the liver (gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis).\n    -   The secretion of insulin when it is not needed (i.e., during fasting) will drive blood glucose levels down further, potentially to a dangerously low level.\n    -   This condition of abnormally low blood glucose is known as **hypoglycemia**. It is the most significant and potentially dangerous adverse effect of sulfonylurea therapy.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Sulfonylureas bind $SUR1$ and allosterically stabilize the closed conformation of $K_{\\text{ATP}}$ independent of $[\\mathrm{ATP}]$, reducing $g_{K}$, depolarizing the $\\beta$-cell, opening voltage-dependent $Ca^{2+}$ channels, and driving insulin secretion during fasting; the ensuing risk is fasting hypoglycemia.**\n-   **Analysis:** This statement correctly identifies the drug target ($SUR1$), the effect on the channel (stabilizes closed state independent of $[\\mathrm{ATP}]$), the electrophysiological consequences (reduced $g_{K}$, depolarization), the downstream signaling (opening of $Ca^{2+}$ channels), the final cellular action (insulin secretion), the context (during fasting), and the principal clinical risk (fasting hypoglycemia).

Sulfonylureas bind Kir6.2 to increase $K_{\\text{ATP}}$ open probability when $[\\mathrm{ATP}]$ is low, maintaining $g_{K}$ and preventing insulin secretion; the ensuing risk is fasting hyperglycemia.**\n-   **Analysis:** This statement is incorrect on multiple points. (1) Sulfonylureas bind SUR1, not Kir6.2. (2) They decrease, not increase, the channel's open probability. (3) They cause, not prevent, insulin secretion. (4) The risk is hypoglycemia, not hyperglycemia.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Sulfonylureas require high $[\\mathrm{ATP}]$ to exert an effect on $K_{\\text{ATP}}$, so they are ineffective during fasting; the principal risk is euglycemic ketoacidosis.**\n-   **Analysis:** This statement is incorrect. The problem explicitly states the drug's action is \"independent of $[\\mathrm{ATP}]$\", which is why it is effective during fasting. In fact, their ATP-independent action is the very reason they pose a risk in the fasting state. Furthermore, euglycemic ketoacidosis is a risk associated with SGLT2 inhibitors, not sulfonylureas.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Sulfonylureas inhibit voltage-dependent $Ca^{2+}$ channels, decreasing insulin release; the principal risk is postprandial hyperglycemia.**\n-   **Analysis:** This statement describes the opposite of the drug's mechanism. Sulfonylureas lead to the *opening*, not inhibition, of voltage-dependent $Ca^{2+}$ channels, thereby *increasing* insulin release. The risk is hypoglycemia, not hyperglycemia.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Meglitinides displace $\\mathrm{MgADP}$ from $SUR1$ to open $K_{\\text{ATP}}$ only after meals, avoiding fasting effects; the principal risk is fasting hyperglycemia.**\n-   **Analysis:** This statement is flawed for several reasons. (1) It discusses meglitinides, not sulfonylureas, which is the subject of the question. (2) Like sulfonylureas, meglitinides *close*, not open, the $K_{\\text{ATP}}$ channel.
