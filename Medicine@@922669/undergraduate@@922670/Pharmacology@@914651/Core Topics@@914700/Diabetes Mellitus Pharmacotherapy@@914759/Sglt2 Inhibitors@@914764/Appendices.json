Let $N(t)$ be the random variable representing the number of DKA events observed in a patient over a time interval of length $t$.\n\nAccording to the model, $N(t)$ follows a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda t$, where $\\lambda$ is the constant hazard rate (or incidence rate). The probability mass function is given by:\n$$P(N(t) = k) = \\frac{(\\lambda t)^k \\exp(-\\lambda t)}{k!}$$\nfor $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\nThe survival function, $S(t)$, is the probability of experiencing no events by time $t$. This corresponds to $k=0$:\n$$S(t) = P(N(t) = 0) = \\frac{(\\lambda t)^0 \\exp(-\\lambda t)}{0!} = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\n\nThe risk of experiencing at least one event by time $t$, denoted $R(t)$, is the complement of the survival function:\n$$R(t) = P(N(t) \\ge 1) = 1 - P(N(t) = 0) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\n\nLet $\\lambda_0$ be the hazard rate for the comparator group (non-SGLT2 therapy) and $\\lambda_1$ be the hazard rate for the treatment group (SGLT2 inhibitor).\nThe problem provides the incidence rate for the comparator group as $0.6$ per $1000$ person-years. We convert this to units of (person-years)$^{-1}$:\n$$\\lambda_0 = \\frac{0.6}{1000} \\text{ years}^{-1} = 0.0006 \\text{ years}^{-1}$$\n\nThe hazard ratio ($HR$) is the ratio of the hazard rates:\n$$HR = \\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_0}$$\nWe are given $HR = 2.4$. We can solve for $\\lambda_1$:\n$$\\lambda_1 = HR \\cdot \\lambda_0 = 2.4 \\times 0.0006 \\text{ years}^{-1} = 0.00144 \\text{ years}^{-1}$$\n\nThe risk for the comparator group at time $t$ is $R_0(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_0 t)$.\nThe risk for the SGLT2 inhibitor group at time $t$ is $R_1(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_1 t)$.\n\nThe Absolute Risk Increase ($ARI$) at time $t$ is the difference in these risks:\n$$ARI(t) = R_1(t) - R_0(t) = \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_1 t)\\right) - \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_0 t)\\right)$$\n$$ARI(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda_0 t) - \\exp(-\\lambda_1 t)$$\n\nThe Number Needed to Harm ($NNH$) is defined as the reciprocal of the $ARI$. We are asked to compute this for a time horizon of $t = 1$ year:\n$$NNH(t) = \\frac{1}{ARI(t)} = \\frac{1}{\\exp(-\\lambda_0 t) - \\exp(-\\lambda_1 t)}$$\n\nSubstituting $t=1$ year and the values for $\\lambda_0$ and $\\lambda_1$:\n$$NNH(1) = \\frac{1}{\\exp(-0.0006 \\times 1) - \\exp(-0.00144 \\times 1)}$$\n$$NNH(1) = \\frac{1}{\\exp(-0.0006) - \\exp(-0.00144)}$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ARI(1) = \\exp(-0.0006) - \\exp(-0.00144) \\approx 0.9994001799 - 0.9985610317 \\approx 0.0008391482$$\n$$NNH(1) = \\frac{1}{0.0008391482} \\approx 1191.682$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to $3$ significant figures.\nThe number $1191.682$ is written in scientific notation as $1.191682 \\times 10^3$. The first three significant digits are $1$, $1$, and $9$. The fourth digit is $1$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\nThe result is $1190$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1190}$$", "id": "4990693"}]}
