All necessary parameters are provided, and the problem is scientifically well-grounded in the principles of enzyme kinetics.\n\nThe initial velocity of an enzymatic reaction, $v_{0}$, following Michaelis–Menten kinetics in the absence of an inhibitor is given by the equation:\n$$v_{0} = \\frac{V_{\\max} [\\mathrm{S}]}{K_{m} + [\\mathrm{S}]}$$\nwhere $V_{\\max}$ is the maximum reaction velocity, $[\\mathrm{S}]$ is the substrate concentration, and $K_{m}$ is the Michaelis constant for the substrate. In this problem, the substrate $[\\mathrm{S}]$ is isopentenyl pyrophosphate, $[\\mathrm{IPP}]$.\n\nFor competitive inhibition, the inhibitor, $[\\mathrm{I}]$, binds reversibly to the enzyme's active site, competing with the substrate. This type of inhibition increases the apparent Michaelis constant, $K_{m}^{\\mathrm{app}}$, but does not affect the maximum velocity, $V_{\\max}$. The apparent Michaelis constant is given by:\n$$K_{m}^{\\mathrm{app}} = K_{m} \\left(1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{I}]}{K_{i}}\\right)$$\nwhere $K_{i}$ is the dissociation constant of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. The factor $\\left(1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{I}]}{K_{i}}\\right)$ is often denoted by the symbol $\\alpha$.\n\nThe initial velocity in the presence of a competitive inhibitor, $v_{i}$, is therefore:\n$$v_{i} = \\frac{V_{\\max} [\\mathrm{S}]}{K_{m}^{\\mathrm{app}} + [\\mathrm{S}]} = \\frac{V_{\\max} [\\mathrm{S}]}{K_{m} \\left(1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{I}]}{K_{i}}\\right) + [\\mathrm{S}]}$$\n\nTo find the ratio $v_{i}/v_{0}$, we divide the equation for the inhibited velocity by the equation for the uninhibited velocity:\n$$\\frac{v_{i}}{v_{0}} = \\frac{\\frac{V_{\\max} [\\mathrm{S}]}{K_{m} \\left(1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{I}]}{K_{i}}\\right) + [\\mathrm{S}]}}{\\frac{V_{\\max} [\\mathrm{S}]}{K_{m} + [\\mathrm{S}]}}$$\nThe terms $V_{\\max}$ and $[\\mathrm{S}]$ in the numerators cancel, yielding the simplified expression:\n$$\\frac{v_{i}}{v_{0}} = \\frac{K_{m} + [\\mathrm{S}]}{K_{m} \\left(1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{I}]}{K_{i}}\\right) + [\\mathrm{S}]}$$\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- $K_{m} = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $K_{i} = 5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n- $[\\mathrm{S}] = [\\mathrm{IPP}] = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $[\\mathrm{I}] = 50\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n\nBefore substituting these values, we must ensure consistent units. The term $\\frac{[\\mathrm{I}]}{K_{i}}$ is a dimensionless ratio, so we can use the provided units directly for that calculation:\n$$\\frac{[\\mathrm{I}]}{K_{i}} = \\frac{50\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{5\\,\\mathrm{nM}} = 10$$\nThe factor $\\alpha$ is therefore:\n$$\\alpha = 1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{I}]}{K_{i}} = 1 + 10 = 11$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of $K_{m}$, $[\\mathrm{S}]$, and $\\alpha$ into the expression for the velocity ratio.

The ratio $v_{i}/v_{0} = 0.375$ indicates that the FPPS enzyme activity is reduced to $37.5\\%$ of its uninhibited level under the specified assay conditions. Since the problem states that prenylation flux is approximately proportional to FPPS flux, this implies that the rate of protein prenylation would also be reduced to approximately $37.5\\%$ of its normal rate. The relative prenylation deficit is the fractional decrease in flux, which is $1 - 0.375 = 0.625$, corresponding to a $62.5\\%$ reduction in this critical post-translational modification process.
