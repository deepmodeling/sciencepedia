A common experimental measure of an inhibitor's strength is its half-maximal inhibitory concentration, or $IC_{50}$. However, this value can change depending on the conditions of the experiment, such as the substrate concentration. This practice challenges you to derive the famous Cheng–Prusoff equation [@problem_id:4941949], which allows us to convert the context-dependent $IC_{50}$ into the intrinsic inhibition constant, $K_i$. Mastering this derivation provides a solid foundation, connecting what we observe in the lab to the fundamental affinity between an inhibitor and its target enzyme.", "problem": "An enzyme catalyzes the conversion of a single substrate $S$ to product under initial rate conditions and follows Michaelis–Menten kinetics, where the Michaelis constant is $K_{m}$. A reversible small-molecule inhibitor $I$ binds competitively to the same site as $S$ on the enzyme, with an inhibition constant $K_{i}$ defined by mass-action binding between $I$ and the free enzyme.

It represents a standard derivation in biochemistry and pharmacology, known as the Cheng-Prusoff equation for competitive inhibition.\n\nThe objective is to derive a closed-form expression for the inhibition constant, $K_i$, as a function of the half maximal inhibitory concentration ($IC_{50}$), the substrate concentration ($[S]$), and the Michaelis constant ($K_{m}$).\n\nFirst, we begin with the Michaelis–Menten equation, which describes the initial velocity, $v_0$, of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction in the absence of an inhibitor:\n$$v_0 = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m + [S]}$$\nHere, $V_{max}$ is the maximum reaction velocity, $[S]$ is the substrate concentration, and $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant.\n\nNext, we introduce a competitive inhibitor, $I$. In a competitive inhibition model, the inhibitor binds reversibly only to the free enzyme, $E$, to form an enzyme-inhibitor complex, $EI$. This binding event is mutually exclusive with substrate binding. The equilibrium for inhibitor binding is:\n$$E + I \\rightleftharpoons EI$$\nThe dissociation constant for this equilibrium is the inhibition constant, $K_i$, defined by the law of mass action as:\n$$K_i = \\frac{[E][I]}{[EI]}$$\nIn the presence of a competitive inhibitor, the maximum velocity, $V_{max}$, remains unchanged because at saturating substrate concentrations, the substrate outcompetes the inhibitor for the enzyme's active site. However, the apparent Michaelis constant, $K_{m,app}$, increases. The initial velocity in the presence of the inhibitor, $v_i$, is given by:\n$$v_i = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_{m,app} + [S]}$$\nTo find $K_{m,app}$, we consider the total enzyme concentration, $[E]_T$, which is the sum of free enzyme, enzyme-substrate complex, and enzyme-inhibitor complex:\n$[E]_T = [E] + [ES] + [EI]$.\nFrom the definition of $K_i$, we can express $[EI]$ as $[EI] = \\frac{[E][I]}{K_i}$. Substituting this into the balance equation gives:\n$[E]_T = [E] + [ES] + \\frac{[E][I]}{K_i} = [E]\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [ES]$.\nUnder the steady-state assumption for Michaelis-Menten kinetics, $K_m = \\frac{[E][S]}{[ES]}$, which means $[E] = \\frac{K_m[ES]}{[S]}$. Substituting this expression for $[E]$ yields:\n$[E]_T = \\frac{K_m[ES]}{[S]}\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [ES] = [ES]\\left(\\frac{K_m}{[S]}\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + 1\\right)$.\nThe initial velocity is $v_i = k_{cat}[ES]$ and the maximum velocity is $V_{max} = k_{cat}[E]_T$. Rearranging for $[ES]$ and substituting into the velocity equation gives:\n$v_i = \\frac{V_{max}[ES]}{[E]_T} = \\frac{V_{max}}{\\frac{K_m}{[S]}\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + 1} = \\frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]}$.\nBy comparing this to the standard form of the equation for $v_i$, we identify the apparent Michaelis constant as:\n$$K_{m,app} = K_m\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right)$$\nThe problem defines $IC_{50}$ as the total inhibitor concentration, $[I]$, that reduces the initial velocity to one-half of the uninhibited velocity, $v_0$. Therefore, when $[I] = IC_{50}$, we have $v_i = \\frac{1}{2}v_0$.\nSubstituting the respective rate equations into this condition yields:\n$$\\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m\\left(1 + \\frac{IC_{50}}{K_i}\\right) + [S]} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m + [S]} \\right)$$\nAssuming $V_{max} \\neq 0$ and $[S] \\neq 0$, we can cancel the term $V_{max}[S]$ from both sides of the equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{K_m\\left(1 + \\frac{IC_{50}}{K_i}\\right) + [S]} = \\frac{1}{2(K_m + [S])}$$\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides gives:\n$$K_m\\left(1 + \\frac{IC_{50}}{K_i}\\right) + [S] = 2(K_m + [S])$$\nExpanding and rearranging the terms to solve for $K_i$:\n$$K_m + K_m\\frac{IC_{50}}{K_i} + [S] = 2K_m + 2[S]$$\n$$K_m\\frac{IC_{50}}{K_i} = (2K_m - K_m) + (2[S] - [S])$$\n$$K_m\\frac{IC_{50}}{K_i} = K_m + [S]$$\nFinally, isolating $K_i$ provides the desired relationship:\n$$K_i = \\frac{K_m IC_{50}}{K_m + [S]}$$\nThis expression can be rewritten in its more common form by dividing the numerator and denominator by $K_m$:\n$$K_i = \\frac{IC_{50}}{1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_m}}$$\nThis is the Cheng-Prusoff equation for a competitive inhibitor.\n\nThe validity of this derivation rests on several key assumptions:\n$1$. The enzyme-substrate reaction follows simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics. This implies that the reaction involves a single substrate, product formation is irreversible, and measurements are made under initial rate conditions where substrate depletion is negligible and the steady-state assumption ($\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = 0$) holds.\n$2$. The inhibitor is a true competitive inhibitor. This means it binds reversibly only to the free enzyme ($E$) and not the enzyme-substrate complex ($ES$), and its binding is mutually exclusive with substrate binding. The binding stoichiometry is assumed to be $1:1$. Consequently, the inhibitor affects $K_m$ but not $V_{max}$.\n$3$. The reaction mechanism is single-step. The equation does not account for multi-step reactions or allosteric effects beyond simple competitive inhibition.\n$4$. The concentration of the inhibitor is not depleted by binding to the enzyme. This is a critical assumption, implying that the total inhibitor concentration, $IC_{50}$, is approximately equal to the free inhibitor concentration, $[I]$, at equilibrium. This condition holds true when the enzyme concentration is much lower than the dissociation constant $K_i$ (i.e., $[E]_T \\ll K_i$). If this \"no tight binding\" condition is violated, a more complex relationship (the Morrison equation) is required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{IC_{50}}{1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_m}}}$$", "id": "4941949"}, {"introduction": "With a grasp of inhibitor potency at the enzyme level, we can now scale up to predict the effect on a patient.

We must consider two distinct models for systemic clearance, $CL$.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental pharmacokinetic principles governing the system at steady state. For a drug administered via a constant-rate intravenous infusion, $R_{\\text{in}}$, the system reaches a steady state where the rate of drug administration equals the rate of drug elimination, $R_{\\text{out}}$.\n$$R_{\\text{in}} = R_{\\text{out}}$$\nThe rate of elimination is defined as the product of the total systemic clearance, $CL$, and the total steady-state plasma concentration, $C_{\\text{ss}}$.\n$$R_{\\text{out}} = CL \\cdot C_{\\text{ss}}$$\nCombining these equations yields the relationship for the total steady-state concentration:\n$$C_{\\text{ss}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{in}}}{CL}$$\nThe unbound concentration at steady state, $C_{u,\\text{ss}}$, is related to the total concentration by the fraction unbound, $f_u$.\n$$C_{u,\\text{ss}} = f_u \\cdot C_{\\text{ss}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{\\text{ss}}$ into the equation for $C_{u,\\text{ss}}$, we obtain a general expression for the steady-state unbound concentration:\n$$C_{u,\\text{ss}} = f_u \\cdot \\frac{R_{\\text{in}}}{CL}$$\nWe are asked to find the fold-change in $C_{u,\\text{ss}}$, which is the ratio of the new concentration ($C_{u,\\text{ss,new}}$) after the displacer is added to the baseline concentration ($C_{u,\\text{ss,base}}$) before the displacer.\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{C_{u,\\text{ss,new}}}{C_{u,\\text{ss,base}}}$$\nUsing our derived expression, we can write the baseline and new concentrations as:\n$$C_{u,\\text{ss,base}} = f_{u,\\text{base}} \\cdot \\frac{R_{\\text{in}}}{CL_{\\text{base}}}$$\n$$C_{u,\\text{ss,new}} = f_{u,\\text{new}} \\cdot \\frac{R_{\\text{in}}}{CL_{\\text{new}}}$$\nThe problem states that the infusion rate, $R_{\\text{in}}$, is constant.
