The $NNT$ is a standard measure in epidemiology and evidence-based medicine, defined as the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$).\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nTo find the $NNT$, we must first calculate the $ARR$.\n\nThe problem provides the definition of $ARR$ as the difference between the baseline risk ($R_b$) and the risk in the treated group ($R_t$).\n$$ARR = R_b - R_t$$\nThe problem also provides the definition of Relative Risk Reduction ($RRR$) as the proportional decrease in risk relative to baseline.

The baseline risk, $R_b$, is given as $0.25$.

The derivation proceeds by systematically applying the three foundational principles provided.\n\nFirst, we model the stimulatory effect of the drug on erythropoiesis. Principle 1 specifies a saturable relationship between the stimulus (dose $D$) and the response (increase in reticulocyte production rate). This relationship is mathematically described by a standard Emax model. The response is the increase in the reticulocyte production rate, $\\Delta P_{ret}$, above the baseline rate, $P_{0}$. The equation for this increase is:\n$$ \\Delta P_{ret}(D) = \\frac{S_{\\max} \\cdot D}{\\text{EC}_{50} + D} $$\nIn this equation, $S_{\\max}$ represents the maximum possible stimulation of the production rate, and $\\text{EC}_{50}$ is the dose that produces half of this maximum effect. The problem defines $E_{\\max}$ as the \"maximum achievable fractional stimulation of erythropoiesis,\" which implies that the maximum stimulation $S_{\\max}$ is a specified fraction of the baseline production rate $P_{0}$.\n$$ S_{\\max} = E_{\\max} \\cdot P_{0} $$\nSubstituting this into the Emax equation yields the expression for the drug-induced increase in reticulocyte production rate:\n$$ \\Delta P_{ret}(D) = \\frac{E_{\\max} \\cdot P_{0} \\cdot D}{\\text{EC}_{50} + D} $$\n\nSecond, we determine the baseline production rate, $P_{0}$. Principle 2 states that at the baseline steady state, the rate of reticulocyte production equals the rate of loss. It also specifies that the \"reticulocyte count is proportional to erythropoiesis rate.\" This key statement allows us to use the given baseline reticulocyte count, $R_{0}$, as a proxy for the baseline production rate, $P_0$. The problem context, with a weekly dose $D$ and a coupling coefficient $\\beta$ defined per week, implies an effective timescale of one week for the production-turnover cycle. Therefore, we can infer that the baseline production rate $P_0$ that maintains the steady-state count $R_0$ is numerically equivalent to $R_0$ per week.\nGiven $R_{0} = 35 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$, we establish the baseline production rate as $P_0 = 35 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}\\,\\text{week}^{-1}$.\n\nThird, we connect the increased reticulocyte production to the change in hemoglobin concentration. Principle 3 posits a linear mapping from the net increase in production, $\\Delta P_{ret}$, to the rate of change of hemoglobin, $\\frac{dH}{dt}$. This relationship is quantified by the coupling coefficient $\\beta$. The units of $\\beta$ are given as $\\text{g}\\,\\text{dL}^{-1}\\,\\text{week}^{-1}$ per $10^{9}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$ increase in production rate per week. This necessitates expressing the production rate increase in units of $10^{9}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}\\,\\text{week}^{-1}$. Let's define a normalized baseline production rate, $\\tilde{P}_{0}$, which is the numerical value of $P_0$ in these units.
