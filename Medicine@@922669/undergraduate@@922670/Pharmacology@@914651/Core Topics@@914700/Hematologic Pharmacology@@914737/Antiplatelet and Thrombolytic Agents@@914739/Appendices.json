It is scientifically grounded in the principles of receptor pharmacology, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objectively stated.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the fractional receptor inhibition based on fundamental principles, followed by a calculation using the provided parameters.\n\nLet $R$ denote the free receptor (GP IIb/IIIa), $I$ denote the free inhibitor (eptifibatide), and $RI$ denote the receptor-inhibitor complex. The reversible binding reaction, assumed to be at equilibrium and with a one-to-one stoichiometry, is described by the following chemical equation:\n$$ R + I \\rightleftharpoons RI $$\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rate of the forward reaction (association) is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants, $k_{on}[R][I]$, where $k_{on}$ is the association rate constant. The rate of the reverse reaction (dissociation) is proportional to the concentration of the product, $k_{off}[RI]$, where $k_{off}$ is the dissociation rate constant. At equilibrium, these rates are equal:\n$$ k_{on}[R][I] = k_{off}[RI] $$\n\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined as the ratio of the dissociation rate constant to the association rate constant, $K_d = \\frac{k_{off}}{k_{on}}$. Rearranging the equilibrium equation gives the expression for $K_d$ in terms of concentrations:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[R][I]}{[RI]} $$\nHere, $[R]$ is the concentration of free receptors, $[I]$ is the concentration of free inhibitor, and $[RI]$ is the concentration of the receptor-inhibitor complex.\n\nThe goal is to determine the fraction of receptors that are inhibited. The problem states that the fraction of occupied receptors corresponds directly to the fraction of inhibited receptors. The fraction of occupied receptors, which we shall denote as $\\theta$, is the ratio of the concentration of occupied receptors to the total concentration of receptors.\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R]_{total}$, is the sum of the concentrations of free receptors and occupied (bound) receptors:\n$$ [R]_{total} = [R] + [RI] $$\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is therefore:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RI]}{[R]_{total}} = \\frac{[RI]}{[R] + [RI]} $$\n\nTo express $\\theta$ as a function of the inhibitor concentration $[I]$ and the dissociation constant $K_d$, we first rearrange the definition of $K_d$ to solve for the free receptor concentration $[R]$:\n$$ [R] = K_d \\frac{[RI]}{[I]} $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the denominator of the equation for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RI]}{ \\left( K_d \\frac{[RI]}{[I]} \\right) + [RI] } $$\nThe term $[RI]$ is a common factor in the denominator, so it can be factored out:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RI]}{[RI] \\left( \\frac{K_d}{[I]} + 1 \\right)} $$\nCanceling the $[RI]$ term from the numerator and the denominator yields:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[I]} + 1} $$\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $[I]$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{1 \\cdot [I]}{ \\left( \\frac{K_d}{[I]} + 1 \\right) \\cdot [I] } = \\frac{[I]}{K_d + [I]} $$\nThis expression represents the fraction of receptors occupied (and thus inhibited) by the inhibitor as a function of the free inhibitor concentration $[I]$ and the dissociation constant $K_d$. This completes the derivation part of the problem.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for the given parameters. The steady free plasma concentration of eptifibatide is given as $[I] = 1 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{mL}$, and the dissociation constant is $K_d = 0.12 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{mL}$.

First, I will validate the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- The interaction between clopidogrel (substrate, $S$) and omeprazole (inhibitor, $I$) at the active site of the enzyme CYP2C19 is described as competitive inhibition.\n- The average free omeprazole concentration is $[I] = 4\\,\\mu\\text{M}$.\n- The inhibitory constant for omeprazole is $K_i = 3\\,\\mu\\text{M}$.\n- The clopidogrel concentration is equal to its Michaelis constant for the enzyme, $[S] = K_m$.\n- The goal is to find the fractional reduction in catalytic activity due to the presence of the inhibitor.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem describes a well-established and clinically significant drug-drug interaction. Clopidogrel is a prodrug activated by CYP2C19, and omeprazole is a known inhibitor of this enzyme. The use of Michaelis-Menten kinetics to model this competitive inhibition is the standard, scientifically correct approach. The provided concentration and constant values are biochemically plausible.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary parameters ($[I]$, $K_i$) and a specific condition ($[S] = K_m$) to calculate a uniquely defined quantity (fractional reduction in activity).

It is deemed **valid**. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, $v$, is described by the Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$v = \\frac{V_{\\text{max}}[S]}{K_m + [S]}$$\nwhere $V_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximum reaction velocity, $[S]$ is the substrate concentration, and $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant.\n\nFirst, let us determine the uninhibited reaction velocity, $v_0$, under the specified condition that $[S] = K_m$.\n$$v_0 = \\frac{V_{\\text{max}}K_m}{K_m + K_m} = \\frac{V_{\\text{max}}K_m}{2K_m} = \\frac{1}{2}V_{\\text{max}}$$\n\nNext, we consider the case of competitive inhibition. In this model, the inhibitor binds to the enzyme's active site, competing with the substrate. The effect is an increase in the apparent Michaelis constant, $K_{m, \\text{app}}$, while $V_{\\text{max}}$ remains unchanged. The modified Michaelis-Menten equation for the inhibited velocity, $v_i$, is:\n$$v_i = \\frac{V_{\\text{max}}[S]}{K_{m, \\text{app}} + [S]}$$\nwhere the apparent Michaelis constant is given by:\n$$K_{m, \\text{app}} = K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $K_{m, \\text{app}}$ into the rate equation gives:\n$$v_i = \\frac{V_{\\text{max}}[S]}{K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]}$$\nWe are given the values $[I] = 4\\,\\mu\\text{M}$ and $K_i = 3\\,\\mu\\text{M}$.

This is calculated as:\n$$\\text{Fractional Reduction} = \\frac{v_0 - v_i}{v_0} = 1 - \\frac{v_i}{v_0}$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions we found for $v_0$ and $v_i$:\n$$\\text{Fractional Reduction} = 1 - \\frac{\\frac{3}{10}V_{\\text{max}}}{\\frac{1}{2}V_{\\text{max}}}$$\nThe $V_{\\text{max}}$ terms cancel out:\n$$\\text{Fractional Reduction} = 1 - \\frac{3/10}{1/2} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{3}{10} \\times 2\\right) = 1 - \\frac{6}{10} = 1 - \\frac{3}{5}$$\n$$\\text{Fractional Reduction} = \\frac{2}{5}$$\nAs a decimal fraction, this is:\n$$\\text{Fractional Reduction} = 0.4$$\nThus, the presence of omeprazole at the given concentration reduces the rate of clopidogrel bioactivation by a fraction of $0.4$, or $40\\%$, compared to the uninhibited state when the substrate concentration is equal to $K_m$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4}$$", "id": "4925147"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate measure of a drug's value is its impact on patient outcomes, which involves a careful balance of benefits and risks.
