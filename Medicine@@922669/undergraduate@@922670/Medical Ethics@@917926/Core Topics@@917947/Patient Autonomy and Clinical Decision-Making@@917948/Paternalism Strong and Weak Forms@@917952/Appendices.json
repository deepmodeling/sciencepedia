Mastering this classification is the first step toward making ethically sound judgments in complex cases.", "problem": "A clinician is asked to design a justificatory ladder of interventions for patients refusing recommended care, ascending from minimal guidance to coercive interference. The ladder is intended to be used consistently across cases by applying threshold conditions that differentiate weak and strong paternalism. Use the following fundamental base in medical ethics: respect for autonomy, beneficence, and nonmaleficence require that any interference with a patient’s liberty be justified by the patient’s welfare and be proportionate to expected harms or benefits; weak paternalism is permissible only when a patient’s decision is not fully voluntary or informed (for example, due to substantially impaired competence or invalid consent), whereas strong paternalism interferes with the choices of a competent, informed patient.\n\nTo formalize, suppose the clinician assigns:\n- An autonomy competence score $A \\in [0,1]$ and an informedness score $E \\in [0,1]$, with thresholds $A^\\* = 0.8$ and $E^\\* = 0.8$ indicating minimally sufficient competence and informedness for valid autonomous choice.\n- A harm metric $H = P \\cdot M$, where $P \\in [0,1]$ is the probability of serious harm if the refusal stands and $M \\in [0,1]$ is the normalized magnitude of the harm; let $H^\\* = 0.7$ be the threshold above which the harm is considered “serious” for proportionality analysis.\n- An intervention severity index $I \\in [0,1]$ that increases with restriction of options or force; and an override indicator $O \\in \\{0,1\\}$, where $O=1$ means the intervention overrides a contemporaneous expressed refusal (for example, compulsion or restraint).\n\nThe ladder’s rungs are precisely defined as follows:\n- Rung $R_1$: Minimal guidance—neutral provision of information and checking understanding without steering defaults, with $I=0$ and $O=0$.\n- Rung $R_2$: Non-coercive nudge—setting a health-promoting default that is easily opt-out, with $I=0.2$ and $O=0$.\n- Rung $R_3$: Procedural gatekeeping—mandating a short “cooling-off” period before honoring a high-risk refusal, with $I=0.4$ and $O=0$.\n- Rung $R_4$: Temporary protective restraint—short-term detention to prevent imminent self-harm while re-evaluating decision-making, with $I=0.6$ and $O=1$.\n- Rung $R_5$: Compulsory treatment—administering the recommended treatment despite refusal, with $I=0.9$ and $O=1$.\n\nFor a specific case, consider a patient who refuses a life-saving blood transfusion based on stable religious beliefs. The clinician’s assessment yields $A=0.9$, $E=0.95$, $P=0.8$, $M=1.0$, hence $H = 0.8$, with the above thresholds $A^\\*=0.8$, $E^\\*=0.8$, $H^\\*=0.7$. The justification rule is: an intervention is paternalistic if it intentionally interferes with the patient’s choices or options for the patient’s welfare (that is, $I0$ and the rationale is the patient’s good); weak paternalism applies only if $A  A^\\*$ or $E  E^\\*$; strong paternalism applies if $A \\ge A^\\*$ and $E \\ge E^\\*$; within paternalism, “coercive” forms are those with $O=1$ (that is, overriding a contemporaneous refusal).\n\nWhich classification along the ladder is correct for this case and thresholds, including the identified shift points from non-paternalistic to paternalistic and from non-coercive to coercive forms?\n\nA. $R_1$: non-paternalistic; $R_2$: weak paternalism; $R_3$: weak paternalism; $R_4$: strong paternalism; $R_5$: strong paternalism; shift to paternalism at $R_2$; shift to coercive at $R_4$.\n\nB. $R_1$: non-paternalistic; $R_2$: strong paternalism (non-coercive); $R_3$: strong paternalism (non-coercive); $R_4$: strong paternalism (coercive); $R_5$: strong paternalism (coercive); shift to paternalism at $R_2$; shift to coercive at $R_4$.\n\nC. $R_1$: weak paternalism; $R_2$: strong paternalism; $R_3$: strong paternalism; $R_4$: strong paternalism; $R_5$: strong paternalism; shift to paternalism at $R_1$; shift to coercive at $R_4$.\n\nD. $R_1$: non-paternalistic; $R_2$: non-paternalistic; $R_3$: weak paternalism; $R_4$: strong paternalism; $R_5$: strong paternalism; shift to paternalism at $R_3$; shift to coercive at $R_4$.", "solution": "The problem statement is a formal exercise in applying a defined set of rules from a model of medical ethics to a specific case. It is well-posed, internally consistent, and uses explicitly defined terms. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe core of the problem is to classify each rung of an intervention ladder ($R_1$ through $R_5$) for a specific patient case according to a given set of formal rules.\n\nFirst, I will validate the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Patient Scores and Thresholds**:\n  - Autonomy competence score: $A \\in [0,1]$\n  - Informedness score: $E \\in [0,1]$\n  - Competence threshold: $A^\\* = 0.8$\n  - Informedness threshold: $E^\\* = 0.8$\n- **Harm Metrics**:\n  - Harm probability: $P \\in [0,1]$\n  - Harm magnitude: $M \\in [0,1]$\n  - Harm metric: $H = P \\cdot M$\n  - Harm threshold: $H^\\* = 0.7$\n- **Intervention Metrics**:\n  - Intervention severity index: $I \\in [0,1]$\n  - Override indicator: $O \\in \\{0,1\\}$\n- **Ladder Rungs**:\n  - $R_1$: Minimal guidance, $I=0$, $O=0$\n  - $R_2$: Non-coercive nudge, $I=0.2$, $O=0$\n  - $R_3$: Procedural gatekeeping, $I=0.4$, $O=0$\n  - $R_4$: Temporary protective restraint, $I=0.6$, $O=1$\n  - $R_5$: Compulsory treatment, $I=0.9$, $O=1$\n- **Specific Patient Case Data**:\n  - $A=0.9$\n  - $E=0.95$\n  - $P=0.8$\n  - $M=1.0$\n- **Classification Rules**:\n  - An intervention is **paternalistic** if $I  0$.\n  - **Weak paternalism** applies if $A  A^\\*$ or $E  E^\\*$.\n  - **Strong paternalism** applies if $A \\ge A^\\*$ and $E \\ge E^\\*$.\n  - An intervention is **coercive** if $O=1$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem provides a self-contained, quantitative model based on established concepts in medical ethics (paternalism, autonomy, coercion). All variables, constants, and rules are explicitly defined. The task is to apply these rules to a given data set. The problem is logically consistent, unambiguous, and well-posed. The inclusion of the harm metric $H$, which is calculated as $H = P \\cdot M = 0.8 \\cdot 1.0 = 0.8$, and its threshold $H^*=0.7$, is noted. The problem statement says this is for \"proportionality analysis,\" but the classification rules provided for paternalism type (weak vs. strong) and coerciveness depend only on $A, E, A^\\*, E^\\*, I,$ and $O$. The harm metric $H$ is not part of the classification logic itself, but would be relevant for a subsequent question about whether a given intervention is *justified*. Since the question only asks for *classification*, $H$ is extraneous data for this specific task. This does not invalidate the problem. The problem is valid.\n\n### Derivation\nThe solution requires a step-by-step application of the provided classification rules.\n\n1.  **Determine the Paternalism Type for the Patient**: The distinction between weak and strong paternalism depends on the patient's autonomy competence score $A$ and informedness score $E$ relative to their respective thresholds $A^\\*$ and $E^\\*$.\n    - Patient's scores: $A=0.9$, $E=0.95$.\n    - Thresholds: $A^\\*=0.8$, $E^\\*=0.8$.\n    - We check the condition for strong paternalism: $A \\ge A^\\*$ and $E \\ge E^\\*$.\n    - Substituting the values: $0.9 \\ge 0.8$ (True) and $0.95 \\ge 0.8$ (True).\n    - Since both conditions are true, any paternalistic intervention for this patient will be classified as **strong paternalism**. The condition for weak paternalism, $A  A^\\*$ or $E  E^\\*$, is not met.\n\n2.  **Classify Each Rung of the Ladder**: We apply the rules for \"paternalistic\" ($I0$), \"strong paternalism\" (as determined above), and \"coercive\" ($O=1$) to each rung.\n\n    -   **Rung $R_1$**: $I=0$, $O=0$.\n        -   Is it paternalistic? The rule is $I  0$. Since $I=0$, this intervention is **non-paternalistic**.\n\n    -   **Rung $R_2$**: $I=0.2$, $O=0$.\n        -   Is it paternalistic? Yes, because $I=0.2  0$.\n        -   What type? As established for this patient, it is **strong paternalism**.\n        -   Is it coercive? No, because $O=0$. Thus, it is non-coercive.\n\n    -   **Rung $R_3$**: $I=0.4$, $O=0$.\n        -   Is it paternalistic? Yes, because $I=0.4  0$.\n        -   What type? It is **strong paternalism**.\n        -   Is it coercive? No, because $O=0$. Thus, it is non-coercive.\n\n    -   **Rung $R_4$**: $I=0.6$, $O=1$.\n        -   Is it paternalistic? Yes, because $I=0.6  0$.\n        -   What type? It is **strong paternalism**.\n        -   Is it coercive? Yes, because $O=1$.\n\n    -   **Rung $R_5$**: $I=0.9$, $O=1$.\n        -   Is it paternalistic? Yes, because $I=0.9  0$.\n        -   What type? It is **strong paternalism**.\n        -   Is it coercive? Yes, because $O=1$.\n\n3.  **Identify Shift Points**:\n    -   The **shift to paternalism** occurs at the first rung where $I  0$. This is **Rung $R_2$**.\n    -   The **shift to coercive** forms of intervention occurs at the first rung where $O=1$. This is **Rung $R_4$**.\n\n4.  **Consolidated Classification**:\n    -   $R_1$: non-paternalistic\n    -   $R_2$: strong paternalism (non-coercive)\n    -   $R_3$: strong paternalism (non-coercive)\n    -   $R_4$: strong paternalism (coercive)\n    -   $R_5$: strong paternalism (coercive)\n    -   Shift to paternalism at $R_2$.\n    -   Shift to coercive at $R_4$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n-   **A. $R_1$: non-paternalistic; $R_2$: weak paternalism; $R_3$: weak paternalism; $R_4$: strong paternalism; $R_5$: strong paternalism; shift to paternalism at $R_2$; shift to coercive at $R_4$.**\n    -   This option incorrectly classifies $R_2$ and $R_3$ as weak paternalism. For this competent and informed patient ($A \\ge A^\\*$ and $E \\ge E^\\*$), any paternalistic intervention is, by definition, strong paternalism.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **B. $R_1$: non-paternalistic; $R_2$: strong paternalism (non-coercive); $R_3$: strong paternalism (non-coercive); $R_4$: strong paternalism (coercive); $R_5$: strong paternalism (coercive); shift to paternalism at $R_2$; shift to coercive at $R_4$.**\n    -   This option correctly identifies $R_1$ as non-paternalistic. It correctly classifies all subsequent rungs ($R_2, R_3, R_4, R_5$) as strong paternalism. It correctly identifies the shift to paternalism at $R_2$ and the shift to coercive interventions at $R_4$. The classification of each rung and the shift points align perfectly with the derivation.\n    -   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **C. $R_1$: weak paternalism; $R_2$: strong paternalism; $R_3$: strong paternalism; $R_4$: strong paternalism; $R_5$: strong paternalism; shift to paternalism at $R_1$; shift to coercive at $R_4$.**\n    -   This option incorrectly classifies $R_1$ as paternalistic. Since $I=0$ for $R_1$, it is non-paternalistic. Consequently, the shift to paternalism cannot be at $R_1$.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. $R_1$: non-paternalistic; $R_2$: non-paternalistic; $R_3$: weak paternalism; $R_4$: strong paternalism; $R_5$: strong paternalism; shift to paternalism at $R_3$; shift to coercive at $R_4$.**\n    -   This option incorrectly classifies $R_2$ as non-paternalistic. Since $I=0.2  0$ for $R_2$, it is paternalistic. This also means the shift to paternalism occurs at $R_2$, not $R_3$. Furthermore, it incorrectly classifies $R_3$ as weak paternalism.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4876414"}, {"introduction": "Real-world clinical scenarios are rarely static, and a patient's decision-making capacity can fluctuate significantly, as in cases of delirium.

Problem Validation**\n\nFirst, I shall validate the problem statement.\n\n*   **Step 1: Extract Givens**\n    *   **Ethical Principles**: Respect for autonomy (for capacitated patients), beneficence/nonmaleficence, weak paternalism (for incapacitated patients), strong paternalism (overriding capacitated patients), emergency exception.\n    *   **Patient State**: $68$-year-old with hypoactive delirium.

The concepts of delirium, fluctuating capacity, informed consent, and paternalism are central to clinical ethics. The use of a mathematical model ($D(t)$, $R(t)$, $\\theta$, $H$) to formalize the decision-making process is a valid and rigorous method used in decision theory and related fields. It provides a clear, objective framework.\n    *   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a set of axioms (the ethical principles), state variables ($D(t)$, $R(t)$), defined thresholds ($\\theta$, $H$), and patient-specific boundary conditions (preferences). The task is to derive a set of decision rules (a policy) that is logically consistent with these inputs, which allows for a unique solution to be constructed.\n    *   **Objectivity**: The language is clinical and precise. The formal model enhances objectivity by replacing subjective terms with quantified variables and thresholds.\n    *   **Consistency and Completeness**: The provided information is internally consistent and sufficient for the task. For instance, the patient's preference to defer non-urgent choices ((c)) aligns perfectly with a policy that must distinguish between high-risk and low-risk deferrals.

It is a well-structured, scientifically grounded, and logically consistent problem that admits a derivable solution based on the provided premises. I will now proceed to derive the policy and evaluate the options.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Time-Sliced Weak Paternalism Policy**\n\nThe policy must specify the correct action for every possible state of the system, defined by the pair of values $(D(t), R(t))$. We can analyze the decision space by exhausting all logical cases based on the given thresholds $\\theta = 0.7$ and $H = 0.05$.\n\n**Case 1: Patient has adequate DMC ($D(t) \\ge \\theta$)**\n*   **Controlling Principle**: Respect for autonomy. The problem states: \"when a patient has adequate Decision-Making Capacity (DMC), the clinician obtains informed consent and follows the patient’s contemporaneous, voluntary choice.\"\n*   **Derived Rule**: Regardless of the risk level $R(t)$, if the patient's capacity is adequate ($D(t) \\ge \\theta$), the clinical team's primary obligation is to obtain informed consent. The patient's decision at that moment is ethically and legally binding. Intervening against the patient's wishes would constitute strong paternalism, which is not permitted by the framework.\n*   **Policy Action**: For any time $t$ such that $D(t) \\ge \\theta$, seek informed consent for any proposed intervention and abide by the patient's decision.\n\n**Case 2: Patient has compromised DMC ($D(t)  \\theta$)**\n*   **Controlling Principles**: The patient cannot provide informed consent. The principles of beneficence, nonmaleficence, and weak paternalism apply. The decision must be stratified by the level of risk associated with deferring the intervention.\n*   **Subcase 2A: Low risk of deferral ($D(t)  \\theta$ and $R(t)  H$)**\n    *   **Analysis**: The risk of serious, irreversible harm from waiting is acceptably low ($R(t)  0.05$). The problem states that the next high-capacity window is predictable within $\\Delta t = 30$ minutes. The patient's documented preference (c) is to \"defer non-urgent choices until lucid.\" Acting without urgency would be an unnecessary paternalistic intrusion. The most appropriate action is to wait for the patient to regain capacity, thereby honoring their previously expressed preference. Meanwhile, patient preference (b) allows for \"reversible, low-burden risk mitigation,\" which is consistent with the principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence.\n    *   **Policy Action**: If $D(t)  \\theta$ and $R(t)  H$, defer the consent-sensitive decision until the next predicted high-capacity window. In the interim, provide only minimal, reversible, low-burden protective measures consistent with patient preferences.\n*   **Subcase 2B: High risk of deferral ($D(t)  \\theta$ and $R(t) \\ge H$)**\n    *   **Analysis**: This is an emergency. Waiting for the next lucid interval would \"expose the patient to a high risk of serious, irreversible harm,\" which is the explicit trigger for the \"emergency exception.\" The duties of beneficence and nonmaleficence compel intervention. This intervention falls under the definition of weak paternalism: it is a \"limited, protective intervention when a patient lacks or has compromised DMC, aimed at preventing serious, avoidable harm.\" The intervention must also be guided by the patient's values, specifically preference (a) to \"prioritize avoiding long-term functional disability.\" Furthermore, the paternalistic action must be temporary. The policy should mandate re-assessment of DMC and a return to the consent-based approach as soon as $D(t) \\ge \\theta$.\n    *   **Policy Action**: If $D(t)  \\theta$ and $R(t) \\ge H$, intervene immediately to prevent harm, invoking the emergency exception. The intervention must be the least intrusive means to achieve the protective goal, be guided by the patient's known values, and be temporally limited. The team must proactively schedule re-assessment of DMC and must cease the paternalistic action and seek informed consent as soon as $D(t) \\ge \\theta$.\n\n**Summary of Derived Policy**\nThe derived policy is a dynamic, risk-stratified algorithm:\n1.  At any given time $t$, assess $D(t)$ and $R(t)$.\n2.  If $D(t) \\ge 0.7$, follow the patient's contemporaneous, informed decision.\n3.  If $D(t)  0.7$:\n    *   If $R(t)  0.05$, wait for the next lucid interval, performing only minor protective care.\n    *   If $R(t) \\ge 0.05$, intervene immediately under the emergency exception and weak paternalism, guided by the patient's values, and reassess capacity frequently.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Always proceed with the clinician’s best-interest choice immediately, regardless of $D(t)$, because beneficence and nonmaleficence outweigh respect for autonomy in hospitalized patients with delirium.**\n    *   This policy institutes strong paternalism by ignoring patient autonomy even when capacity is adequate ($D(t) \\ge \\theta$). It directly violates the foundational principle of respect for autonomy for capacitated persons. The premise that a diagnosis of delirium universally negates autonomy is ethically incorrect.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B. At each time slice, measure $D(t)$ and estimate $R(t)$; if $D(t)\\ge\\theta$, obtain informed consent and follow the patient’s contemporaneous choice; if $D(t)\\theta$ and $R(t)H$, defer non-urgent decisions until the next predicted high-capacity window, performing only reversible, low-burden risk mitigation consistent with documented preferences; if $D(t)\\theta$ and $R(t)\\ge H$, apply the emergency exception narrowly with temporally limited, protective intervention, aligned with known values, while scheduling prompt re-assessment within $\\Delta t$ and ceasing paternalism once $D(t)\\ge\\theta$.**\n    *   This option perfectly matches the policy derived from the first principles. It correctly handles the case of adequate capacity ($D(t) \\ge \\theta$). It correctly bifurcates the case of inadequate capacity ($D(t)  \\theta$) based on the risk threshold $H$. It appropriately prescribes deferral for low risk and emergency intervention for high risk. It incorporates patient preferences, the temporal limits of paternalism, and the requirement to reassess.\n    *   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **C. Compute the daily average capacity $\\bar{D}=\\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T}D(t)\\,dt$ and, if $\\bar{D}\\ge\\theta$, treat the patient as competent all day; if $\\bar{D}\\theta$, treat the patient as incompetent all day, relying entirely on a surrogate’s decisions.**\n    *   This policy is fundamentally flawed because it averages out the critical feature of the problem: fluctuating capacity. A \"time-sliced\" problem requires a time-sliced solution, not a time-averaged one. This approach would wrongly disenfranchise the patient during their lucid periods or fail to protect them during their impaired periods, depending on the daily average. For a patient with $20$ minutes/hour of lucidity, the average capacity would likely fall below $\\theta$, leading to the patient being incorrectly treated as incompetent for the entire day.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Designate a surrogate decision-maker to make all choices whenever delirium is present, independent of $D(t)$ or the patient’s previously expressed preferences, to reduce decision delays and clinical risk.**\n    *   This policy makes two critical errors. First, it substitutes a diagnosis (\"delirium\") for a functional assessment of capacity ($D(t)$), thereby ignoring the patient's lucid intervals. Second, it explicitly disregards the patient's previously expressed preferences, which is a direct violation of the principles of both weak paternalism and standard substituted judgment.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E.

This exercise formalizes this \"sliding scale\" principle by using a decision-theoretic model to weigh the ethical disvalue of violating autonomy against the disvalue of preventable harm [@problem_id:4876453]. By deriving the evidentiary threshold for capacity as a function of harm severity, you will gain a deeper, quantitative understanding of the balance between respecting patient choice and the duty to protect from harm.", "problem": "Consider the ethics of paternalism in clinical practice. Strong paternalism is overriding a patient’s decision even when the patient has decision-making capacity (DMC), whereas weak paternalism is intervening only when the patient lacks DMC. In a sliding-scale approach, the evidentiary threshold for DMC is higher when the outcome’s seriousness is greater, in order to avoid serious harm when the patient may lack DMC.\n\nLet $p$ denote the posterior probability that a particular patient has DMC regarding a refusal of a recommended intervention. Let the severity of the potential bad outcome from honoring the refusal be represented by a nonnegative scalar $s \\ge 0$ on a normalized seriousness scale. Suppose the ethics committee uses the following foundational base to guide action selection: choose the action that minimizes the expected ethical disvalue, where expected ethical disvalue is computed as the probability-weighted sum of disvalues across the relevant states of the world. Let $\\alpha  0$ be the disvalue of violating autonomy by overriding the decision of a patient who has DMC, and let $\\beta  0$ be the per-unit disvalue of harm when honoring the refusal of a patient who lacks DMC, so that the harm disvalue when honoring an incapable refusal scales as $\\beta s$.\n\nAssume the two available actions are: honor the refusal (respect autonomy) or override the refusal (intervene paternalistically). Under honoring the refusal, if the patient has DMC there is no autonomy violation disvalue and no added harm beyond accepted risk; if the patient lacks DMC, the bad outcome of seriousness $s$ occurs, with ethical disvalue $\\beta s$. Under overriding the refusal, if the patient has DMC there is an autonomy violation disvalue $\\alpha$; if the patient lacks DMC, the bad outcome is prevented and there is no harm disvalue.\n\nStarting only from these definitions and the principle of minimizing expected ethical disvalue, derive the evidentiary threshold function $T'(s)$ such that honoring the refusal is ethically justified if and only if $p \\ge T'(s)$. Show that $T'(s)$ is a monotonic function of $s$. Express your final $T'(s)$ as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $s$. No numerical approximation is required.", "solution": "The problem asks us to derive an evidentiary threshold function, $T'(s)$, for the posterior probability $p$ that a patient has decision-making capacity (DMC), such that honoring the patient's refusal of an intervention is ethically justified if and only if $p \\ge T'(s)$. The justification is to be based on the principle of minimizing expected ethical disvalue.\n\nFirst, we define the states of the world and their associated probabilities based on the patient's DMC:\n1.  The patient has DMC. The probability of this state is $p$.\n2.  The patient lacks DMC. The probability of this state is $1-p$.\n\nNext, we define the two possible actions and calculate the ethical disvalue for each action in each state of the world, as specified in the problem statement.\nThe disvalue of violating autonomy by overriding the decision of a patient with DMC is $\\alpha  0$.\nThe per-unit disvalue of harm is $\\beta  0$, and the severity of the bad outcome is $s \\ge 0$. The total disvalue of harm is thus $\\beta s$.\n\nThe disvalues for each action-state combination are as follows:\n\nAction 1: Honor the patient's refusal.\n-   If the patient has DMC (probability $p$): The patient's autonomy is respected, and no harm is caused by the physician's action. The disvalue is $0$.\n-   If the patient lacks DMC (probability $1-p$): The refusal is honored, leading to a bad outcome of seriousness $s$. The disvalue is $\\beta s$.\n\nAction 2: Override the patient's refusal.\n-   If the patient has DMC (probability $p$): The patient's autonomy is violated. The disvalue is $\\alpha$.\n-   If the patient lacks DMC (probability $1-p$): The intervention prevents the bad outcome. There is no harm disvalue and no autonomy violation in overriding the decision of an incapable person. The disvalue is $0$.\n\nNow, we compute the expected ethical disvalue for each action. The expected disvalue, $E[D]$, is the sum of the disvalues of each outcome weighted by their respective probabilities.\n\nLet $E[D_{\\text{Honor}}]$ be the expected disvalue of honoring the refusal.\n$$E[D_{\\text{Honor}}] = (p \\times 0) + ((1-p) \\times \\beta s) = (1-p) \\beta s$$\n\nLet $E[D_{\\text{Override}}]$ be the expected disvalue of overriding the refusal.\n$$E[D_{\\text{Override}}] = (p \\times \\alpha) + ((1-p) \\times 0) = p \\alpha$$\n\nAccording to the decision principle, honoring the refusal is ethically justified if and only if its expected disvalue is less than or equal to the expected disvalue of overriding the refusal.\n$$E[D_{\\text{Honor}}] \\le E[D_{\\text{Override}}]$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the expected disvalues, we get the inequality:\n$$(1-p) \\beta s \\le p \\alpha$$\n\nWe must now solve this inequality for $p$ to find the condition under which honoring the refusal is justified. The problem asks for this condition to be expressed in the form $p \\ge T'(s)$.\n$$\\beta s - p \\beta s \\le p \\alpha$$\nRearranging the terms to isolate $p$:\n$$\\beta s \\le p \\alpha + p \\beta s$$\n$$\\beta s \\le p(\\alpha + \\beta s)$$\n\nTo solve for $p$, we must divide by $(\\alpha + \\beta s)$. We are given that $\\alpha  0$, $\\beta  0$, and $s \\ge 0$.\nIf $s  0$, then $\\alpha + \\beta s$ is strictly positive.\nIf $s = 0$, then $\\alpha + \\beta s = \\alpha$, which is strictly positive.\nIn all cases for $s \\ge 0$, the term $(\\alpha + \\beta s)$ is strictly positive, so we can divide by it without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$p \\ge \\frac{\\beta s}{\\alpha + \\beta s}$$\n\nThis inequality gives the condition for honoring the refusal. The expression on the right-hand side is the evidentiary threshold function $T'(s)$.\n$$T'(s) = \\frac{\\beta s}{\\alpha + \\beta s}$$\n\nFinally, we must show that $T'(s)$ is a monotonic function of $s$ for $s \\ge 0$. To do this, we examine the sign of its first derivative with respect to $s$. Let us compute $\\frac{dT'(s)}{ds}$ using the quotient rule for differentiation, which states that for a function $f(x) = \\frac{u(x)}{v(x)}$, the derivative is $f'(x) = \\frac{u'(x)v(x) - u(x)v'(x)}{[v(x)]^2}$.\n\nHere, our function is $T'(s) = \\frac{\\beta s}{\\alpha + \\beta s}$. Let $u(s) = \\beta s$ and $v(s) = \\alpha + \\beta s$.\nThe derivatives are:\n$$\\frac{du}{ds} = \\beta$$\n$$\\frac{dv}{ds} = \\beta$$\n\nApplying the quotient rule:\n$$\\frac{dT'(s)}{ds} = \\frac{(\\beta)(\\alpha + \\beta s) - (\\beta s)(\\beta)}{(\\alpha + \\beta s)^2}$$\n$$\\frac{dT'(s)}{ds} = \\frac{\\alpha\\beta + \\beta^2 s - \\beta^2 s}{(\\alpha + \\beta s)^2}$$\n$$\\frac{dT'(s)}{ds} = \\frac{\\alpha\\beta}{(\\alpha + \\beta s)^2}$$\n\nWe are given that $\\alpha  0$ and $\\beta  0$. Thus, the numerator $\\alpha\\beta$ is strictly positive. The denominator $(\\alpha + \\beta s)^2$ is the square of a real number. As established earlier, $\\alpha + \\beta s  0$ for all $s \\ge 0$, so its square is also strictly positive.\nSince both the numerator and the denominator are strictly positive, the derivative $\\frac{dT'(s)}{ds}$ is strictly positive for all $s \\ge 0$.\n$$\\frac{dT'(s)}{ds}  0$$\nA function with a strictly positive first derivative over its domain is strictly monotonically increasing. A strictly increasing function is, by definition, a monotonic function. Therefore, $T'(s)$ is a monotonic function of $s$.\n\nThe final expression for the threshold function $T'(s)$ is a single closed-form analytic expression as derived.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\beta s}{\\alpha + \\beta s}}\n$$", "id": "4876453"}]}
