{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The duty to protect begins with a crucial first step: accurately identifying risk. While risk assessment tools can be valuable aids, they are not infallible, and relying on them without critical thought can lead to significant ethical missteps. This exercise explores the \"base rate fallacy,\" a common statistical trap, to demonstrate how even a seemingly accurate screening tool can produce a high number of false alarms in a low-risk population. By working through this scenario, you will develop the critical skills needed to interpret screening data correctly, ensuring that the profound decision to breach confidentiality is based on sound, individualized assessment rather than misleading statistics [@problem_id:4868474].", "problem": "A clinician in an outpatient psychiatry clinic is considering whether to breach confidentiality under a duty-to-protect obligation consistent with the Tarasoff precedent, which requires action when a patient poses a serious and imminent threat to an identifiable person. The clinician uses an uncalibrated qualitative label \"high-risk\" produced by a screening tool to flag patients potentially at imminent risk of violence. In this clinic, the prevalence of patients who, upon careful evaluation, truly pose a serious and imminent threat to an identifiable person is $0.5\\%$. Assume a cohort of $10{,}000$ consecutive patients is screened. The tool design yields a \"high-risk\" flag with sensitivity $90\\%$ and specificity $90\\%$ for the condition \"serious and imminent threat to an identifiable person.\" Using only core definitions of prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, conditional probability, and the ethical standards of confidentiality and the duty to protect described above, determine the quantitative consequences of relying on this uncalibrated \"high-risk\" label and evaluate whether routine breach of confidentiality for all flagged patients is ethically justified. In particular, calculate the expected number of true positives and false positives and the resulting Positive Predictive Value (PPV), where Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is defined as the probability that a person truly has the condition given a positive test, and False Positive Rate (FPR) is defined as $1-\\text{specificity}$. Then, select the single best statement that correctly interprets the base rate fallacy in this low-prevalence setting and its implications for ethically justified breach under Tarasoff.\n\nA. Even with sensitivity $90\\%$ and specificity $90\\%$ in a setting with prevalence $0.5\\%$ among $10{,}000$ patients, a \"high-risk\" label yields approximately $995$ false positives and $45$ true positives, so the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is roughly $4\\%$. This demonstrates the base rate fallacy and supports caution: breaching confidentiality purely on the label, without individualized assessment of seriousness, imminence, and an identifiable target, risks unjustified erosion of confidentiality.\n\nB. With specificity $90\\%$, the False Positive Rate (FPR) is $90\\%$, so most \"high-risk\" labels will be false; therefore, clinicians should never breach confidentiality under Tarasoff.\n\nC. The base rate fallacy implies that sensitivity determines Positive Predictive Value (PPV) regardless of prevalence, so a sensitivity of $90\\%$ guarantees that $90\\%$ of \"high-risk\" labels are true positives.\n\nD. Under Tarasoff, any \"high-risk\" label legally mandates immediate warning of all potential victims, independent of imminence and identifiability, so breaching confidentiality is always justified whenever the tool flags \"high-risk.\"", "solution": "The problem statement is critically validated as follows.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   **Clinical Context**: A clinician is considering a breach of confidentiality based on the Tarasoff duty-to-protect obligation.\n-   **Condition for Breach**: The duty applies when \"a patient poses a serious and imminent threat to an identifiable person.\" This is the condition of interest.\n-   **Screening Tool**: An uncalibrated screening tool produces a qualitative label \"high-risk\".\n-   **Prevalence ($P(D+)$)**: The prevalence of the condition (truly posing a serious and imminent threat) is $0.5\\%$.\n-   **Cohort Size ($N$)**: A cohort of $10{,}000$ consecutive patients is screened.\n-   **Sensitivity ($P(T+|D+)$)**: The sensitivity of the \"high-risk\" flag for the condition is $90\\%$.\n-   **Specificity ($P(T-|D-)$)**: The specificity of the \"high-risk\" flag for the condition is $90\\%$.\n-   **Definitions Provided**:\n    -   Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is \"the probability that a person truly has the condition given a positive test.\"\n    -   False Positive Rate (FPR) is defined as \"$1-\\text{specificity}$.\"\n-   **Tasks**:\n    1.  Calculate the expected number of true positives and false positives.\n    2.  Calculate the Positive Predictive Value (PPV).\n    3.  Evaluate the ethical justification of routinely breaching confidentiality for all flagged patients.\n    4.  Select the best statement interpreting the base rate fallacy and its ethical implications.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is well-grounded in established principles of biostatistics (prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, PPV) and medical ethics (confidentiality, duty to protect). The definitions provided are standard. The scenario is a classic and realistic illustration of the challenges of applying screening tests in low-prevalence populations. The problem is scientifically and factually sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all the necessary numerical data and clear definitions to perform the required calculations. The questions asked are specific and answerable based on the givens.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, precise language. It sets up a quantitative analysis of an ethical dilemma, which is a standard method in applied ethics and public health. It avoids subjective or biased framing.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the instructions (e.g., scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, ambiguity). All terms are either standard or explicitly defined. The data is consistent and sufficient to proceed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A full derivation and evaluation of options will be performed.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nLet $D+$ denote the event that a patient has the condition, i.e., \"poses a serious and imminent threat to an identifiable person.\"\nLet $D-$ denote the event that a patient does not have the condition.\nLet $T+$ denote a positive test result, i.e., the tool flags the patient as \"high-risk.\"\nLet $T-$ denote a negative test result.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n-   Total number of patients, $N = 10{,}000$.\n-   Prevalence, $P(D+) = 0.5\\% = 0.005$.\n-   Sensitivity, $P(T+|D+) = 90\\% = 0.90$.\n-   Specificity, $P(T-|D-) = 90\\% = 0.90$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of patients in the cohort of $N=10{,}000$ who truly have the condition and who do not.\n-   Number of patients with the condition (True Cases):\n    $N_{D+} = N \\times P(D+) = 10{,}000 \\times 0.005 = 50$.\n-   Number of patients without the condition (True Non-Cases):\n    $N_{D-} = N \\times (1 - P(D+)) = 10{,}000 \\times (1 - 0.005) = 10{,}000 \\times 0.995 = 9{,}950$.\n\nNext, we calculate the expected number of true positives (TP), false positives (FP), false negatives (FN), and true negatives (TN).\n\n-   **True Positives (TP)**: Patients with the condition who test positive.\n    $TP = N_{D+} \\times P(T+|D+) = 50 \\times 0.90 = 45$.\n-   **False Negatives (FN)**: Patients with the condition who test negative.\n    $FN = N_{D+} \\times (1 - P(T+|D+)) = 50 \\times (1 - 0.90) = 50 \\times 0.10 = 5$.\n-   **False Positives (FP)**: Patients without the condition who test positive. The probability of this is the False Positive Rate, $FPR = P(T+|D-) = 1 - P(T-|D-) = 1 - \\text{specificity}$.\n    $FPR = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n    $FP = N_{D-} \\times FPR = 9{,}950 \\times 0.10 = 995$.\n-   **True Negatives (TN)**: Patients without the condition who test negative.\n    $TN = N_{D-} \\times P(T-|D-) = 9{,}950 \\times 0.90 = 8{,}955$.\n\nThe total number of patients who test positive is $TP + FP = 45 + 995 = 1040$.\nThe total number of patients who test negative is $FN + TN = 5 + 8955 = 8960$.\nThe sum is $1040 + 8960 = 10{,}000$, which matches the total cohort size, so the calculations are consistent.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Positive Predictive Value (PPV).\n$PPV = P(D+|T+) = \\frac{\\text{Number of True Positives}}{\\text{Total Number of Positives}} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}$\n$PPV = \\frac{45}{45 + 995} = \\frac{45}{1040}$\n$PPV \\approx 0.043269...$\nConverting to a percentage, $PPV \\approx 4.33\\%$.\n\nThe quantitative consequences are stark. In a cohort of $10{,}000$ patients, the tool is expected to flag $1040$ as \"high-risk\". Of these $1040$ individuals, only $45$ actually meet the criteria for a Tarasoff breach, while $995$ do not. This extremely low PPV of $\\sim 4\\%$ is a direct result of the **base rate fallacy**: even with a respectable-seeming sensitivity and specificity of $90\\%$, the very low prevalence ($0.5\\%$) of the condition means that the vast majority of positive test results are false positives. The number of false positives ($995$) swamps the number of true positives ($45$).\n\nEthically, a policy of routinely breaching confidentiality for all $1040$ flagged patients would result in $995$ unjustified breaches for every $45$ justified ones. This represents a significant and disproportionate erosion of patient confidentiality, a cornerstone of the therapeutic relationship. The proper use of such a screening tool is not as a definitive mandate for action, but as a signal to trigger a more careful, individualized clinical assessment to determine if the specific criteria of the Tarasoff standard (seriousness, imminence, identifiable victim) are actually met.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Even with sensitivity $90\\%$ and specificity $90\\%$ in a setting with prevalence $0.5\\%$ among $10{,}000$ patients, a \"high-risk\" label yields approximately $995$ false positives and $45$ true positives, so the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is roughly $4\\%$. This demonstrates the base rate fallacy and supports caution: breaching confidentiality purely on the label, without individualized assessment of seriousness, imminence, and an identifiable target, risks unjustified erosion of confidentiality.**\n-   **Quantitative Claims**: The statement claims approximately $995$ false positives and $45$ true positives. Our calculation yielded exactly $FP=995$ and $TP=45$. This is correct. It claims the PPV is roughly $4\\%$. Our calculation yielded $PPV \\approx 4.33\\%$, which is accurately described as \"roughly $4\\%$\".\n-   **Conceptual and Ethical Interpretation**: The statement correctly identifies this phenomenon as a demonstration of the base rate fallacy. It draws the correct ethical conclusion: the low PPV means that acting on the flag alone is unjustified and that a further, individualized assessment is required to meet the specific legal and ethical standards of Tarasoff. The reasoning is sound and follows directly from the quantitative results.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. With specificity $90\\%$, the False Positive Rate (FPR) is $90\\%$, so most \"high-risk\" labels will be false; therefore, clinicians should never breach confidentiality under Tarasoff.**\n-   **Quantitative Claims**: This statement claims that with a specificity of $90\\%$, the FPR is $90\\%$. This is incorrect. The FPR is defined as $1 - \\text{specificity}$, which is $1 - 0.90 = 0.10$, or $10\\%$. The premise is factually wrong.\n-   **Conceptual and Ethical Interpretation**: The conclusion that clinicians should *never* breach is an overgeneralization and ethically dangerous. The duty to protect still exists. The tool, despite its flaws, did identify $45$ true cases. The correct response is not to ignore all signals but to investigate them properly.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The base rate fallacy implies that sensitivity determines Positive Predictive Value (PPV) regardless of prevalence, so a sensitivity of $90\\%$ guarantees that $90\\%$ of \"high-risk\" labels are true positives.**\n-   **Conceptual and Ethical Interpretation**: This statement fundamentally misunderstands the base rate fallacy. The entire point of the fallacy is that PPV is critically dependent on prevalence (the base rate), and is not determined by sensitivity alone. It also mistakenly equates sensitivity, $P(T+|D+)$, with PPV, $P(D+|T+)$. Our calculation shows the PPV is $\\sim 4\\%$, not $90\\%$.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Under Tarasoff, any \"high-risk\" label legally mandates immediate warning of all potential victims, independent of imminence and identifiability, so breaching confidentiality is always justified whenever the tool flags \"high-risk.\"**\n-   **Conceptual and Ethical Interpretation**: This statement misrepresents the Tarasoff standard. As described in the problem itself, the duty is predicated on a \"serious and imminent threat to an identifiable person.\" The statement incorrectly claims the duty is independent of imminence and identifiability. A \"high-risk\" flag from a screening tool is not a legal mandate; it is a piece of clinical data that requires interpretation and further assessment by a qualified professional to determine if the legal and ethical thresholds for a breach have been met.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, option A is the only one that is quantitatively, conceptually, and ethically sound.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4868474"}, {"introduction": "Once a clinician has completed a thorough assessment and concluded that a serious and imminent threat to an identifiable person truly exists, the duty to protect compels action. The challenge then shifts from assessment to communication: how can you warn the potential victim effectively while honoring your concurrent duty to protect the patient's confidentiality? This practice focuses on applying the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) \"minimum necessary\" standard, challenging you to craft a warning that conveys the essential information for safety without disclosing extraneous clinical details. Mastering this balance is a core competency in ethically navigating these high-stakes situations [@problem_id:4868499].", "problem": "A licensed psychologist in a state that recognizes a Tarasoff-type duty to protect learns during a clinical encounter that an adult client has stated a credible intent to harm a specifically identifiable former partner. The psychologist assesses the threat as serious and imminent based on current clinical risk assessment best practices and relevant state guidance. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule, disclosures to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to health or safety are permitted to persons reasonably able to prevent or lessen the threat, including the intended victim, subject to the minimum necessary standard for Protected Health Information (PHI).

The validity of the problem rests on the soundness of these principles and the clarity of the scenario.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Actor:** A licensed psychologist.\n- **Legal Context 1:** The psychologist operates in a state with a \"Tarasoff-type duty to protect.\"\n- **Legal Context 2:** The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule applies.\n- **Clinical Situation:** An adult client has stated a credible intent to harm a specifically identifiable former partner.\n- **Clinical Assessment:** The threat is judged by the psychologist to be \"serious and imminent.\"\n- **HIPAA Permitted Disclosure:** Disclosures are permitted to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to health or safety.\n- **Permitted Recipients:** Disclosures can be made to persons reasonably able to prevent or lessen the threat, including the intended victim.\n- **HIPAA Constraint:** The \"minimum necessary\" standard applies, requiring the disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI) to be limited to what is \"reasonably necessary to accomplish the protective purpose.\"\n- **Guiding Principle:** Extraneous clinical details not necessary for protective action should be avoided.\n- **Objective:** Identify the disclosure script that best satisfies four criteria:\n    1. Conveys the essential content of the threat.\n    2. Communicates the gravity and imminence of risk.\n    3. Recommends reasonable precautions.\n    4. Avoids unnecessary PHI, adhering to the minimum necessary standard.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is valid.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is grounded in well-established legal precedents and ethical guidelines in mental health practice, namely the principles derived from *Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California* and the federal HIPAA regulations. These are foundational concepts in the field.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined. It provides a set of rules (Tarasoff duty, HIPAA, minimum necessary standard) and a specific scenario. It asks for the evaluation of given options against a clear, multi-part objective function (the four criteria). This structure allows for a unique, best-fit solution to be determined through logical deduction.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language.

It is a standard ethical-legal reasoning problem, not factually unsound, metaphorical, incomplete, or ill-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Option Analysis\nThe core task is to balance the duty to protect the potential victim with the duty to maintain client confidentiality. The HIPAA \"minimum necessary\" standard is the key constraint. An optimal disclosure must contain all information necessary for the victim to take effective protective action, but absolutely no information beyond that.\n\nThe necessary components of the disclosure are:\n1.  **Identity of the Threat Source:** The victim must know who the threat is from (e.g., \"Jordan Smith\"). This is necessary PHI.\n2.  **Nature of the Threat:** The victim must understand that the threat is serious, imminent, and involves physical harm. Specifics like method or location are necessary if they help the victim to protect themself.\n3.  **Actionable Advice:** The victim must be given concrete steps to take (e.g., \"contact law enforcement,\" \"increase security\").\n\nThe prohibited components are:\n1.  **Clinical Details:** The client's diagnosis, medication, treatment history, substance use, or psychodynamic formulation are not necessary for the victim's immediate protection and constitute a breach of the minimum necessary rule.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option against these criteria.\n\n**A. \"Hello, my name is Dr. Lee.

It names the source (Jordan Smith), the intent (harm), the location (workplace), the imminence (within $48$ hours), and the means (firearm). This information is directly relevant to protection.\n- **Communicates Gravity/Imminence:** Yes. It uses the precise language \"serious and imminent threat\" and provides a concrete timeframe.\n- **Recommends Precautions:** Yes. It provides clear, actionable steps: contact police, secure the workplace, and alter routines.\n- **Avoids Unnecessary PHI:** Yes. It discloses only the client's name and the threat details, which are necessary for the protective purpose. It correctly withholds all clinical information (diagnosis, etc.).\n\n**Verdict on A: Correct.** This option perfectly balances the duty to protect with the requirement for minimum necessary disclosure.\n\n**B. \"Hello, this is Dr. Lee from the University Counseling Center.

It names the source and intent.\n- **Communicates Gravity/Imminence:** Partially. It states \"I think it’s serious\" but is weak on imminence.\n- **Recommends Precautions:** Weakly. \"Be careful and try not to be alone\" is vague and less helpful than the specific recommendations in option A.\n- **Avoids Unnecessary PHI:** No. This is a severe violation. It discloses the client's age ($34$), diagnosis (Bipolar I disorder), medication status (stopped lithium), session attendance (missed $2$ sessions), and substance use (drinking heavily). This is a massive and illegal breach of confidentiality, far exceeding the minimum necessary standard.\n\n**Verdict on B: Incorrect.** This option fails catastrophically on the PHI criterion.\n\n**C. \"Hi, I’m calling because you might be in danger soon. Please be vigilant and take care of yourself.\"**\n\n- **Conveys Threat:** No. It fails to identify the source of the danger or the nature of the threat. The victim cannot take meaningful action without knowing who or what to be vigilant about.\n- **Communicates Gravity/Imminence:** No. \"Might be in danger soon\" is too vague and does not convey the \"serious and imminent\" nature of the threat.\n- **Recommends Precautions:** No. \"Be vigilant and take care of yourself\" is generic and not actionable.\n- **Avoids Unnecessary PHI:** Yes, but to the point of rendering the warning useless.\n\n**Verdict on C: Incorrect.** This option fails the primary purpose of a Tarasoff warning, which is to enable the potential victim to take protective measures.

It names the source and intent.\n- **Communicates Gravity/Imminence:** No. It fails to state the threat is serious or imminent. Worse, the discussion of the treatment plan (\"we are adjusting his medications,\" \"monitoring him closely\") could create a false sense of security, leading the victim to believe the situation is being managed by the clinic and that they do not need to take urgent action.\n- **Recommends Precautions:** Weakly. \"Avoid contact\" is a reasonable but potentially insufficient recommendation. It omits the critical step of contacting law enforcement.\n- **Avoids Unnecessary PHI:** No. It discloses the client's diagnosis (post-traumatic stress disorder) and treatment plan details. This is a clear violation of the minimum necessary standard.\n\n**Verdict on D: Incorrect.** This option both discloses unnecessary PHI and fails to properly convey the level of risk, potentially endangering the victim by providing false reassurance.\n\nBased on the systematic analysis, Option A is the only choice that robustly satisfies all four criteria laid out in the problem statement.

After assessing risk and taking protective action, creating a legally and ethically defensible record is paramount. This final practice guides you through the essential components of thorough documentation in a high-risk scenario. By identifying the critical elements of a defensible note—from time-stamped actions and consultations to a clear ethical-legal rationale—you will learn how to construct a record that demonstrates reasoned, timely, and standard-of-care-compliant decision-making [@problem_id:4868523].", "problem": "A clinician in a university counseling center evaluates a $22$-year-old student during an urgent visit.

In one contiguous note, include the following: time-stamped entries for key events (e.g., assessment began at $14{:}05$, supervisor consulted at $14{:}22$, law enforcement notified at $14{:}42$, attempted victim contact at $14{:}55$ with outcome); verbatim quotes of the threat; identification of the anticipated victim and basis for identifiability; structured risk assessment findings and a synthesized risk formulation distinguishing risk factors and protective factors; the clinician’s determination of seriousness and imminence; names/roles and time-stamps of consultations (e.g., supervisor, on-call legal counsel) and advice received; a clear legal-ethical rationale for disclosure citing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) serious-threat exception at Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Section $45$ CFR $164.512(j)$ and the applicable state duty-to-protect standard derived from Tarasoff; the specific protective actions taken (e.g., nature and content of warnings to the identifiable person and to law enforcement, including agency, badge or case number if provided), attempts and outcomes when contact could not be made, and safety measures discussed with the patient (e.g., means restriction); the disposition decision (e.g., rationale for or against involuntary hospitalization) tied to the risk formulation; residual risk, contingency plans, and near-term follow-up plan.**\n\nThis option is comprehensive and aligns perfectly with the established best practices for risk management and documentation in a *Tarasoff* situation. It includes every necessary element: contemporaneous time-stamping, specific data (verbatim quotes), a detailed risk formulation, documentation of consultation, an explicit legal and ethical rationale for action (correctly citing the relevant HIPAA provision, $45$ CFR $164.512(j)$), detailed records of the protective actions taken, and a forward-looking plan for patient management. This level of detail is precisely what is required to create a defensible record that demonstrates the clinician met the standard of care by acting in a reasoned, timely, and legally-grounded manner.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Append the prior week’s note and add: “Dx: Adjustment Disorder; Tarasoff risk.” Include billing codes and a checkbox indicating “high risk,” and postpone all disclosure decisions and documentation until after the next scheduled therapy session.**\n\nThis option describes actions that constitute professional negligence. The threat is specified as imminent (\"tomorrow at $20{:}00$\"). Postponing protective actions and documentation until a future session is an abdication of the duty to protect. The documentation itself is conclusory and utterly insufficient (\"Tarasoff risk\" and a checkbox provide no data or reasoning). Appending this to a prior note is also poor practice for a new, urgent clinical event. This behavior would be indefensible.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Record time-stamps for clinician actions and a brief summary of a phone consultation with a colleague, then place a call to the potential victim’s workplace and leave a detailed voicemail about the patient’s threat without verifying identity. Do not include the content of the threat, the basis for identifiability, or any legal-ethical rationale for the disclosure.**\n\nThis option describes a reckless and harmful course of action. While some documentation elements are present (time-stamps, consultation), the protective action itself is improper. Leaving a detailed voicemail with sensitive protected health information at a workplace, without verifying the recipient's identity, is a flagrant and unjustifiable breach of confidentiality. It fails to ensure the warning reaches the intended victim and exposes the patient's information inappropriately. Furthermore, the documentation omits the core justification for the action (threat content, legal rationale), rendering the partial record indefensible. The clinician would be liable for both the improper breach and for failing to take *reasonable* steps to protect the victim.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Because confidentiality is paramount, document the patient’s statement, de-escalation steps taken, and a safety plan, but do not notify the potential victim or law enforcement. Note that any disclosure would violate confidentiality absent patient authorization, so no breach occurred, and schedule follow-up in $2$ weeks.**\n\nThis option is based on a fundamental misinterpretation of the clinician's legal and ethical obligations. While confidentiality is a foundational principle, it is not absolute. The *Tarasoff* framework creates a specific, mandatory exception. The statement that \"any disclosure would violate confidentiality\" is factually incorrect in this context. By failing to take protective action (notifying the victim or police), the clinician fails to discharge the duty to protect. Scheduling follow-up in $2$ weeks for a threat that is imminent is clinically inappropriate and negligent. This inaction is precisely what the *Tarasoff* ruling aimed to prevent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4868523"}]}
