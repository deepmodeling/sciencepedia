The committee adopts the reasonable patient standard of materiality: a risk is material if knowledge of it could change a reasonable patient's decision. The ethical elements to be applied are disclosure (information about material risks) and voluntariness (freedom from coercion and undue influence). Assume the following decision-theoretic model, grounded in the widely used quality-adjusted life year (QALY) framework and rational choice: a reasonable patient selects the option with the higher expected QALY.\n\nConsider a primary surgical intervention with expected benefit of $B$ quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and a rare catastrophic harm of magnitude $H$ QALYs that occurs with unknown probability $p$. Suppose there is an alternative non-surgical option with expected benefit $B_{\\text{alt}}$ QALYs and no catastrophic risk. Without disclosure of the catastrophic risk, the patient compares the primary intervention's stated benefit to the alternative and would choose the primary intervention if $B > B_{\\text{alt}}$. If the catastrophic risk is disclosed, the reasonable patient computes the primary intervention's expected QALY as $B - pH$ and would choose the alternative if $B - pH < B_{\\text{alt}}$.\n\nTo incorporate voluntariness, define a voluntariness coefficient $v \\in (0,1]$, representing the probability that the patient can act in accord with their preference absent coercion or undue influence.

Express your final answer as a decimal number. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires us to determine the minimum catastrophic risk probability, denoted as $p_{\\min}$, that mandates disclosure under a hospital's ethics policy. The policy is based on a decision-theoretic model using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).\n\nFirst, let us formalize the conditions specified in the problem statement. A reasonable patient's decision is altered by the disclosure of the catastrophic risk if their preference changes from the primary surgical intervention to the alternative non-surgical option.\n\nWithout disclosure, the patient compares the stated benefit of the primary intervention, $B$, to the benefit of the alternative, $B_{\\text{alt}}$. Given $B = 0.12$ QALY and $B_{\\text{alt}} = 0.08$ QALY, the condition $B > B_{\\text{alt}}$ is satisfied ($0.12 > 0.08$), so the patient would choose the primary surgical intervention.\n\nWith disclosure, the patient evaluates the expected QALY of the primary intervention, which is calculated as $B - pH$, where $p$ is the probability of the catastrophic harm and $H$ is its magnitude. The patient will then choose the alternative option if its expected QALY is higher, i.e., if $B - pH < B_{\\text{alt}}$. This inequality represents the condition under which a reasonable patient's decision is altered by the disclosure.\n\nThe hospital policy mandates disclosure when the chance of altering a reasonable patient's decision is at least $\\alpha$. The problem defines this \"chance of altering a decision\" in a specific way. It is equal to the voluntariness coefficient $v$ if the condition $B - pH < B_{\\text{alt}}$ is met, and it is $0$ otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the policy requires disclosure if and only if two conditions are met simultaneously:\n1. The patient's decision is altered, which occurs if $B - pH < B_{\\text{alt}}$.\n2. The probability of this alteration occurring, $v$, meets the policy threshold: $v \\ge \\alpha$.\n\nLet's examine the second condition with the given values: $v = 0.70$ and $\\alpha = 0.60$. The inequality $v \\ge \\alpha$ becomes $0.70 \\ge 0.60$, which is true. This confirms the feasibility of the policy, as stated in the problem. Since this condition is satisfied, the requirement for disclosure simplifies to only the first condition being met.\n\nThus, the risk with probability $p$ must be disclosed if and only if:\n$$B - pH < B_{\\text{alt}}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the minimum risk probability, $p_{\\min}$, that must be disclosed. This corresponds to the threshold value of $p$ that marks the boundary for the above inequality. To find this, we solve the inequality for $p$.\n\n$$B - B_{\\text{alt}} < pH$$\n\nGiven that the magnitude of harm $H = 20$ is a positive value, we can divide both sides of the inequality by $H$ without changing the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$p > \\frac{B - B_{\\text{alt}}}{H}$$\n\nThis inequality shows that disclosure is required for any probability $p$ that is strictly greater than the value $\\frac{B - B_{\\text{alt}}}{H}$. The \"minimum probability that must be disclosed,\" $p_{\\min}$, is interpreted as this threshold value, which is the infimum of the set of probabilities requiring disclosure.\n\n$$p_{\\min} = \\frac{B - B_{\\text{alt}}}{H}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$B = 0.12$ QALY\n$B_{\\text{alt}} = 0.08$ QALY\n$H = 20$ QALY\n\n$$p_{\\min} = \\frac{0.12 - 0.08}{20}$$\n$$p_{\\min} = \\frac{0.04}{20}$$\n$$p_{\\min} = \\frac{4 \\times 10^{-2}}{2 \\times 10^1} = 2 \\times 10^{-3}$$\n$$p_{\\min} = 0.002$$\n\nTherefore, the minimum catastrophic risk probability that must be disclosed according to the committee's policy is $0.002$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.002}$$", "id": "4856932"}, {"introduction": "More information is not always better.

The committee adopts the reasonable-person materiality standard from medical ethics: a risk is disclosed if and only if its expected disutility is at least a threshold. Specifically, for each risk indexed by $i$, with probability $p_i$ and severity quantified as disutility $s_i$ on a dimensionless scale, define $r_i = p_i s_i$. The policy discloses all and only those risks with $r_i \\ge \\tau$, where $\\tau$ is a threshold to be chosen.

The hospital uses an empirically validated monotone model in which the fraction of material information correctly understood after reading $k$ disclosed items is $C(k) = \\exp(-\\alpha k)$, with $\\alpha = 0.1$. The committee requires $C(k) \\ge 0.60$, where $k$ is the number of disclosed risks.\n\nFor a particular procedure, six reasonably quantified risks have been identified:\n- Risk A: $p_A = 0.25$, $s_A = 0.8$.\n- Risk B: $p_B = 0.04$, $s_B = 6$.\n- Risk C: $p_C = 0.015$, $s_C = 25$.\n- Risk D: $p_D = 0.002$, $s_D = 110$.\n- Risk E: $p_E = 0.35$, $s_E = 0.3$.\n- Risk F: $p_F = 0.0004$, $s_F = 800$.\n\nAssume no inducements are offered beyond standard care, so the voluntariness condition is operationalized solely through the comprehension requirement $C(k) \\ge 0.60$.

We operationalize materiality using expected disutility $r_i = p_i s_i$, a standard decision-theoretic measure that captures the probability-weighted burden of a risk, and voluntariness via a comprehension function $C(k)$ that decreases with the number of disclosed items $k$ to avoid overload that could undermine autonomous choice.\n\nThe policy discloses all risks with $r_i \\ge \\tau$, hence the set of disclosed items is $D(\\tau) = \\{ i : r_i \\ge \\tau \\}$ and $k(\\tau) = |D(\\tau)|$.

Thus at most $5$ risks may be disclosed while maintaining $C(k) \\ge 0.60$.\n\nNow examine the disclosure constraint by considering which risks are undisclosed for a given threshold $\\tau$. For any $\\tau$ that lies strictly between two adjacent $r_i$ values, the set $D(\\tau)$ consists of all risks with $r_i$ greater than that interval’s lower endpoint.

Hence $\\tau \\le 0.105$ is infeasible by voluntariness.\n\n- If $0.105 < \\tau \\le 0.2$, the disclosed set excludes only Risk E, because $r_E = 0.105 < \\tau \\le 0.2 \\le r_A = 0.2$.

Therefore no $\\tau$ in this range is feasible.\n\nAll larger thresholds would exclude even more risks and only increase the undisclosed sum, so they cannot satisfy the disclosure constraint. Therefore, the feasible region for $\\tau$ is precisely the interval $(0.105, 0.2]$, where the upper endpoint maximizes $\\tau$.\n\nThe committee seeks the largest feasible $\\tau$, hence the optimal threshold is\n$$\n\\tau^{\\ast} = 0.2.\n$$\nAt $\\tau^{\\ast} = 0.2$, exactly $5$ risks are disclosed, comprehension remains at least $0.60$ because $k = 5$ gives $C(5) = \\exp(-0.5) \\approx 0.60653$, and the undisclosed expected disutility is $0.105 \\le 0.15$, meeting the disclosure constraint.
