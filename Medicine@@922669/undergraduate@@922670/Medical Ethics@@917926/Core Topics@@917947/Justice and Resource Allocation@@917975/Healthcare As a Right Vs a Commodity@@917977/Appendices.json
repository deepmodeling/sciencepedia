The Gini coefficient, $G$, is defined as twice the area between the line of perfect equality and the Lorenz curve. The line of perfect equality is the line $y=x$ on a plot of cumulative visit share ($y$) versus cumulative population share ($x$). The Lorenz curve plots the actual cumulative visit share as a function of the cumulative population share, when the population is ranked from poorest to richest.\n\nFirst, we must construct the points for the Lorenz curve from the given data. The population is divided into $5$ quintiles, so each group represents a population share of $p_i = 0.2$. Let $v_i$ be the share of visits for quintile $i$, where $i=1$ corresponds to the poorest quintile and $i=5$ to the richest.

The stated benchmark for a rights-based view is \"equal per capita utilization.\" This corresponds to a perfectly equal distribution, where each quintile of the population (a $0.2$ share) receives a $0.2$ share of the visits. In this benchmark case, the Lorenz curve would coincide with the line of perfect equality, and the Gini coefficient would be $G=0$.\n\nThe calculated Gini coefficient is $G=0.2280$, which is a positive value, indicating a departure from the benchmark of perfect equality. The Lorenz curve lies below the line of equality, which signifies that the lower-income quintiles receive a share of visits that is less than their share of the population, while the higher-income quintiles receive a share of visits that is greater than their share of the population. Specifically, the richest 20% of the population accounts for 35% of visits, while the poorest 20% accounts for only 10%. This pro-rich inequality in utilization is characteristic of a system where access is influenced by ability to pay, i.e., healthcare as a commodity.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the calculation and the stated benchmark, the observed distribution is not consistent with the ethical claim that healthcare is a right.

The hospital seeks to respect a rights-based floor while following a utilitarian goal of maximizing the expected number of lives saved.
