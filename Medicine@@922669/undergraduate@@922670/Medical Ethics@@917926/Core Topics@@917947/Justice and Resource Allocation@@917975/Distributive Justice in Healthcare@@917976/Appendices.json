It is scientifically grounded in established economic optimization and health policy principles (QALY maximization). It is well-posed, with a concave objective function and a convex, compact constraint set, which guarantees the existence of a unique maximum. The problem is objective, formally specified, and contains no contradictions or ambiguities.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe objective is to maximize the total QALYs, $Q_{total}(n_A, n_B)$, subject to the given constraints.\n\nFirst, we formulate the objective function by integrating the marginal QALY gain functions:\n$$\nQ_A(n_A) = \\int_{0}^{n_A} (\\alpha_A - \\beta_A t) \\, dt = \\left[ \\alpha_A t - \\frac{1}{2}\\beta_A t^2 \\right]_0^{n_A} = \\alpha_A n_A - \\frac{1}{2}\\beta_A n_A^2\n$$\n$$\nQ_B(n_B) = \\int_{0}^{n_B} (\\alpha_B - \\beta_B s) \\, ds = \\left[ \\alpha_B s - \\frac{1}{2}\\beta_B s^2 \\right]_0^{n_B} = \\alpha_B n_B - \\frac{1}{2}\\beta_B n_B^2\n$$\nThe total QALY function is the sum:\n$$\nQ_{total}(n_A, n_B) = \\left(\\alpha_A n_A - \\frac{1}{2}\\beta_A n_A^2\\right) + \\left(\\alpha_B n_B - \\frac{1}{2}\\beta_B n_B^2\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the given parameter values:\n$$\nQ_{total}(n_A, n_B) = \\left(10 n_A - \\frac{1}{2}(2) n_A^2\\right) + \\left(12 n_B - \\frac{1}{2}(3) n_B^2\\right) = 10 n_A - n_A^2 + 12 n_B - \\frac{3}{2} n_B^2\n$$\nWe must maximize this function subject to the constraints:\n1. $4n_A + 3n_B \\leq 24$\n2. $0 \\leq n_A \\leq 5$\n3. $0 \\leq n_B \\leq 4$\n\nThe objective function is concave, and the constraints define a convex set. This is a classic convex optimization problem. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. A necessary condition for optimality is that the marginal utility per unit of cost is equal for all expenditures. If the budget is fully spent, which is expected since the marginal QALYs are positive for the initial patients, the budget constraint becomes an equality, $4n_A + 3n_B = 24$.\n\nThe marginal benefit per unit cost for Treatment A is $\\frac{M_A(n_A)}{k_A}$ and for Treatment B is $\\frac{M_B(n_B)}{k_B}$. At the optimum, these must be equal:\n$$\n\\frac{M_A(n_A)}{k_A} = \\frac{M_B(n_B)}{k_B}\n$$\nThis is the equimarginal principle, a first principle of economic optimization. Substituting the expressions for $M_A$, $M_B$, $k_A$, and $k_B$:\n$$\n\\frac{10 - 2n_A}{4} = \\frac{12 - 3n_B}{3}\n$$\nThis equation establishes a relationship between the optimal $n_A$ and $n_B$. We can simplify it:\n$$\n3(10 - 2n_A) = 4(12 - 3n_B)\n$$\n$$\n30 - 6n_A = 48 - 12n_B\n$$\n$$\n12n_B - 6n_A = 18\n$$\nDividing by $6$:\n$$\n2n_B - n_A = 3 \\implies n_A = 2n_B - 3\n$$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two variables, $n_A$ and $n_B$:\n1. $n_A = 2n_B - 3$\n2. $4n_A + 3n_B = 24$\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$$\n4(2n_B - 3) + 3n_B = 24\n$$\n$$\n8n_B - 12 + 3n_B = 24\n$$\n$$\n11n_B = 36\n$$\n$$\nn_B = \\frac{36}{11}\n$$\nNow, substitute the value of $n_B$ back into the expression for $n_A$:\n$$\nn_A = 2\\left(\\frac{36}{11}\\right) - 3 = \\frac{72}{11} - \\frac{33}{11} = \\frac{39}{11}\n$$\nThe candidate for the optimal allocation is $(n_A, n_B) = (\\frac{39}{11}, \\frac{36}{11})$. We must verify if this solution lies within the feasible region defined by the constraints $0 \\leq n_A \\leq 5$ and $0 \\leq n_B \\leq 4$.\n\nFor $n_A$: $0 \\leq \\frac{39}{11} \\leq 5$. Since $\\frac{39}{11} \\approx 3.545$, this is true.\nFor $n_B$: $0 \\leq \\frac{36}{11} \\leq 4$. Since $\\frac{36}{11} \\approx 3.273$, this is also true.\n\nThe solution satisfies all constraints and is derived from the first-order conditions for optimality under an active budget constraint. Because the problem is a maximization of a strictly concave function over a closed, convex set, this unique interior point on the budget line is the global maximum. The fractional values are interpreted as expected patient counts.\n\nTherefore, the optimal allocation is to treat an expected number of $\\frac{39}{11}$ patients with Treatment A and $\\frac{36}{11}$ patients with Treatment B to maximize the total QALYs under the budget constraint.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{39}{11}  \\frac{36}{11} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4856432"}, {"introduction": "While maximizing total health is a compelling goal, many ethical frameworks argue that we also have special duties to the sickest patients and to historically disadvantaged groups.

Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**.\n\n### Part 1: Determination of Weights and Priority Scores\n\nThe weights $w_s$ and $w_b$ are determined by the system of two linear equations:\n1.  $w_s + w_b = 1$\n2.  $\\frac{w_b}{w_s} = \\frac{3}{2}$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have $w_b = \\frac{3}{2} w_s$. Substituting this into the first equation:\n$$w_s + \\frac{3}{2} w_s = 1$$\n$$\\frac{5}{2} w_s = 1$$\n$$w_s = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4$$\n\nNow, we can find $w_b$:\n$$w_b = 1 - w_s = 1 - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6$$\nThe weights are $w_s = 0.4$ and $w_b = 0.6$.\n\nUsing these weights, the priority score for each patient $i$ is calculated using the formula $u_i = 0.4 s_i + 0.6 b_i$.\n-   $u_1 = 0.4(0.90) + 0.6(0.30) = 0.36 + 0.18 = 0.54$\n-   $u_2 = 0.4(0.20) + 0.6(0.95) = 0.08 + 0.57 = 0.65$\n-   $u_3 = 0.4(0.70) + 0.6(0.60) = 0.28 + 0.36 = 0.64$\n-   $u_4 = 0.4(0.50) + 0.6(0.80) = 0.20 + 0.48 = 0.68$\n-   $u_5 = 0.4(0.85) + 0.6(0.40) = 0.34 + 0.24 = 0.58$\n\nThe priority scores are: $u_1=0.54$, $u_2=0.65$, $u_3=0.64$, $u_4=0.68$, $u_5=0.58$.\n\n### Part 2: Optimal Allocation\n\nThe optimization problem is to find the allocation vector $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ that maximizes the total priority $U = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} u_i x_i$ subject to the given constraints.\n\nThe constraints are:\n1.  Supply constraint: $\\sum_{i=1}^{5} x_i = 3$.\n2.  Fairness constraint: The disadvantaged group is $\\mathrm{D} = \\{1, 3, 5\\}$. The number of treated patients from this group must be at least $\\lceil rK \\rceil = \\lceil \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\rceil = \\lceil 1.5 \\rceil = 2$. Thus, $x_1 + x_3 + x_5 \\geq 2$.\n3.  Binary allocation: $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for all $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$.\n\nLet's list the patients and their scores in descending order of priority:\n1.  Patient $4$ ($u_4 = 0.68$, Group $\\mathrm{ND}$)\n2.  Patient $2$ ($u_2 = 0.65$, Group $\\mathrm{ND}$)\n3.  Patient $3$ ($u_3 = 0.64$, Group $\\mathrm{D}$)\n4.  Patient $5$ ($u_5 = 0.58$, Group $\\mathrm{D}$)\n5.  Patient $1$ ($u_1 = 0.54$, Group $\\mathrm{D}$)\n\nThe fairness constraint ($x_1 + x_3 + x_5 \\geq 2$) combined with the supply constraint ($x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 3$) dictates the possible structures of the group of three treated patients. Let $N_D$ be the number of treated patients from group $\\mathrm{D}$ and $N_{ND}$ be the number from group $\\mathrm{ND}$. We must have $N_D+N_{ND}=3$ and $N_D \\geq 2$. This allows for two scenarios:\n\n**Scenario A: $N_D = 2$ and $N_{ND} = 1$.**\nTo maximize the total priority, we must select the two patients from group $\\mathrm{D}$ with the highest scores and the one patient from group $\\mathrm{ND}$ with the highest score.\n-   The scores for group $\\mathrm{D}$ are $\\{u_1, u_3, u_5\\} = \\{0.54, 0.64, 0.58\\}$. The two highest are $u_3=0.64$ and $u_5=0.58$. So, we select patients $3$ and $5$.\n-   The scores for group $\\mathrm{ND}$ are $\\{u_2, u_4\\} = \\{0.65, 0.68\\}$. The highest is $u_4=0.68$. So, we select patient $4$.\n-   The allocation is to treat patients $3$, $4$, and $5$.\n-   The allocation vector is $x = (0, 0, 1, 1, 1)$.\n-   The total priority is $U_A = u_3 + u_4 + u_5 = 0.64 + 0.68 + 0.58 = 1.90$.\n\n**Scenario B: $N_D = 3$ and $N_{ND} = 0$.**\nTo maximize the total priority, we must select all three patients from group $\\mathrm{D}$.\n-   The scores for group $\\mathrm{D}$ are $\\{0.54, 0.64, 0.58\\}$.\n-   The allocation is to treat patients $1$, $3$, and $5$.\n-   The allocation vector is $x = (1, 0, 1, 0, 1)$.\n-   The total priority is $U_B = u_1 + u_3 + u_5 = 0.54 + 0.64 + 0.58 = 1.76$.\n\nComparing the total priorities from the two feasible scenarios, $U_A = 1.90$ and $U_B = 1.76$. The maximum total priority is $1.90$, which is achieved in Scenario A.\n\nTherefore, the optimal allocation is to treat patients $3$, $4$, and $5$. The corresponding allocation vector is $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5) = (0, 0, 1, 1, 1)$.\n\nThe final answer requires the five priority scores followed by the five allocation indicators.\n-   Priority scores: $(u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4, u_5) = (0.54, 0.65, 0.64, 0.68, 0.58)$\n-   Allocation indicators: $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5) = (0, 0, 1, 1, 1)$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.54  0.65  0.64  0.68  0.58  0  0  1  1  1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4417440"}, {"introduction": "What if our primary duty is not to maximize the total amount of good, but to protect the most vulnerable?

This occurs at the value of $\\epsilon$ for which the social evaluation functional $V_{\\epsilon}(W)$ yields the same value for both policies.\n\nThe social evaluation functional is given by:\n$$\nV_{\\epsilon}(W) = \\min_{i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}} h_i + \\epsilon \\sum_{i=1}^{3} h_i\n$$\n\nFirst, we evaluate $V_{\\epsilon}(W_1)$ for the policy $W_1 = (5, 5, 5)$.\nThe individual QALYs are $h_1=5$, $h_2=5$, and $h_3=5$.\nThe well-being of the least-advantaged individual is the minimum of these values:\n$$\n\\min_{i} h_i = \\min(5, 5, 5) = 5\n$$\nThe aggregate well-being is the sum of these values:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{3} h_i = 5 + 5 + 5 = 15\n$$\nSubstituting these into the functional gives:\n$$\nV_{\\epsilon}(W_1) = 5 + \\epsilon(15)\n$$\n\nNext, we evaluate $V_{\\epsilon}(W_2)$ for the policy $W_2 = (10, 10, 1)$.\nThe individual QALYs are $h_1=10$, $h_2=10$, and $h_3=1$.\nThe well-being of the least-advantaged individual is:\n$$\n\\min_{i} h_i = \\min(10, 10, 1) = 1\n$$\nThe aggregate well-being is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{3} h_i = 10 + 10 + 1 = 21\n$$\nSubstituting these into the functional gives:\n$$\nV_{\\epsilon}(W_2) = 1 + \\epsilon(21)\n$$\n\nThe problem states that for $\\epsilon  \\epsilon^{\\star}$, policy $W_1$ is preferred, and for $\\epsilon  \\epsilon^{\\star}$, policy $W_2$ is preferred. This implies that at the threshold $\\epsilon = \\epsilon^{\\star}$, the two policies are valued equally.\n$$\nV_{\\epsilon^{\\star}}(W_1) = V_{\\epsilon^{\\star}}(W_2)\n$$\nWe set the two expressions equal to each other and solve for $\\epsilon^{\\star}$:\n$$\n5 + 15\\epsilon^{\\star} = 1 + 21\\epsilon^{\\star}\n$$\nTo solve for $\\epsilon^{\\star}$, we gather terms involving $\\epsilon^{\\star}$ on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other.\n$$\n5 - 1 = 21\\epsilon^{\\star} - 15\\epsilon^{\\star}\n$$\n$$\n4 = 6\\epsilon^{\\star}\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon^{\\star} = \\frac{4}{6}\n$$\nReducing the fraction to its simplest form gives:\n$$\n\\epsilon^{\\star} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\n\nTo confirm this threshold, let us examine the preference for $\\epsilon$ values around $\\epsilon^{\\star}$.\nThe system prefers $W_1$ over $W_2$ if $V_{\\epsilon}(W_1)  V_{\\epsilon}(W_2)$:\n$$\n5 + 15\\epsilon  1 + 21\\epsilon\n$$\n$$\n4  6\\epsilon\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{4}{6}  \\epsilon \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\epsilon  \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThis confirms that for all $\\epsilon  \\frac{2}{3}$, policy $W_1$ is strictly preferred.\n\nThe system prefers $W_2$ over $W_1$ if $V_{\\epsilon}(W_2)  V_{\\epsilon}(W_1)$:\n$$\n1 + 21\\epsilon  5 + 15\\epsilon\n$$\n$$\n6\\epsilon  4\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon  \\frac{4}{6} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\epsilon  \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThis confirms that for all $\\epsilon  \\frac{2}{3}$, policy $W_2$ is strictly preferred.\n\nThus, the exact threshold value is $\\epsilon^{\\star} = \\frac{2}{3}$. This value precisely marks the boundary where the secondary utilitarian concern (aggregate QALYs) becomes decisive enough to overcome the primary Rawlsian concern for the worst-off individual, who is better off under $W_1$ (receiving $5$ QALYs) than under $W_2$ (receiving $1$ QALY).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$$", "id": "4417351"}]}
