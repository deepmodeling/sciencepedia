In a macro-allocation context with $3$ equally sized groups and equal moral weight across groups, we represent each group’s outcome by its expected per-person health utility on the normalized Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) scale in $[0,1]$. Under maximin, the social ordering ranks policies by the minimum of these group utilities: for a policy with group utility vector $(u_{1}, u_{2}, u_{3})$, its maximin score is $\\min\\{u_{1}, u_{2}, u_{3}\\}$, and the policy with the larger minimum is preferred.\n\nApply this to Policy A and Policy B:\n- Policy A has vector $(0.4, 0.6, 0.9)$.

This next problem [@problem_id:4868675] delves into the mechanics of using QALYs in cost-effectiveness analysis, focusing on the common but ethically debated practice of discounting future health gains. This calculation will reveal how discounting systematically devalues long-term interventions and helps you grasp its profound implications for prioritizing preventive care versus short-term treatments.", "problem": "A national health authority is engaging in macro-allocation of health resources by comparing long-term preventive programs to short-term treatments. For ethical evaluation using cost-effectiveness, the authority adopts the Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) framework, where a Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) is a unit of health benefit aggregating longevity and health-related quality of life on a $[0,1]$ scale. It is a well-tested practice in health economics to discount future health benefits to reflect opportunity cost of capital and social time preference, using exponential discounting with a constant annual rate.\n\nConsider an intervention that yields $1$ QALY at the end of each year for $5$ consecutive years, occurring at times $t=1,2,3,4,5$. Assume a constant annual social discount rate of $r=0.03$. Using the standard present value approach in cost-effectiveness analysis with the discount factor $d(t)=(1+r)^{-t}$, first compute the present value $PV$ of the $5$ future QALYs. Then, to illustrate how discounting ethically affects the valuation of long-term interventions compared to no discounting, compute the ratio of the discounted present value to the undiscounted total QALYs, i.e., $PV/5$. \n\nReport only the ratio $PV/5$ as a unitless decimal. Round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a ratio involving the present value of a stream of future health benefits, known as Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). The calculation is based on the principle of exponential discounting, a standard method in health economics and cost-effectiveness analysis.\n\nFirst, let us define the given parameters. The intervention yields a benefit of $Q_t = 1$ QALY at the end of each year for $t \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. The constant annual social discount rate is given as $r = 0.03$.\n\nThe present value, $PV$, of this stream of future QALYs is calculated by summing the discounted value of each future QALY. The discount factor for a benefit at time $t$ is given by the formula $d(t) = (1+r)^{-t}$.\n\nThe present value of the QALY received at the end of year $t$ is $Q_t \\cdot d(t) = Q_t (1+r)^{-t}$. Since $Q_t = 1$ for each of the $5$ years, the total present value $PV$ is the sum of the discounted values for $t=1$ to $t=5$:\n$$PV = \\sum_{t=1}^{5} 1 \\cdot (1+r)^{-t} = \\sum_{t=1}^{5} (1+r)^{-t}$$\n\nThis is a finite geometric series with $5$ terms. The first term is $a = (1+r)^{-1}$ and the common ratio is also $(1+r)^{-1}$. The sum of a finite geometric series with first term $a$, common ratio $k$ ($k \\neq 1$), and $n$ terms is given by $S_n = a \\frac{1-k^n}{1-k}$.\n\nIn this case, $a = (1+r)^{-1}$, $k = (1+r)^{-1}$, and $n=5$. Substituting these into the formula:\n$$PV = (1+r)^{-1} \\frac{1 - ((1+r)^{-1})^5}{1 - (1+r)^{-1}} = \\frac{1}{1+r} \\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-5}}{1 - \\frac{1}{1+r}}$$\n\nSimplifying the denominator:\n$$1 - \\frac{1}{1+r} = \\frac{1+r-1}{1+r} = \\frac{r}{1+r}$$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $PV$:\n$$PV = \\frac{1}{1+r} \\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-5}}{\\frac{r}{1+r}} = \\frac{1}{r} \\left(1 - (1+r)^{-5}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical value for the discount rate, $r=0.03$:\n$$PV = \\frac{1}{0.03} \\left(1 - (1+0.03)^{-5}\\right) = \\frac{1}{0.03} \\left(1 - (1.03)^{-5}\\right)$$\n\nThe numerical value of $(1.03)^{-5}$ is approximately $0.86260878$.\n$$PV \\approx \\frac{1}{0.03} (1 - 0.86260878) = \\frac{1}{0.03} (0.13739122) \\approx 4.579707$$\n\nThe problem then asks for the ratio of this discounted present value, $PV$, to the undiscounted total QALYs. The undiscounted total is simply the sum of the QALYs without any discounting:\n$$\\text{Undiscounted Total} = \\sum_{t=1}^{5} 1 = 5$$\n\nThe required ratio is $\\frac{PV}{5}$.\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{PV}{5} = \\frac{4.579707}{5} \\approx 0.9159414$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

With prioritarian equity weights $w(h)=h^{-1}$, the marginal social value of a QALY accruing to an individual with baseline lifetime QALYs $h$ is $w(h)$. For group-specific allocations, we can aggregate at the group level by multiplying the group’s total QALY gain by the group-specific weight.\n\nGroup weights:\n- Worse-off baseline $h_{W}=50$ yields $w_{W}=h_{W}^{-1}=\\frac{1}{50}$.\n- Better-off baseline $h_{B}=80$ yields $w_{B}=h_{B}^{-1}=\\frac{1}{80}$.\n\nCompute prioritarian-weighted sums $P_{X}$ and $P_{Y}$:\n\n- Policy $X$: $100$ QALYs equally to $100$ people implies each person receives $\\Delta q=1$.
