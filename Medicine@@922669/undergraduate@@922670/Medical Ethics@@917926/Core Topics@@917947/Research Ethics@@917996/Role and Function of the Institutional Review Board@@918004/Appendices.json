My task is to validate the problem, and if valid, derive the correct classification and oversight recommendation according to the provided principles.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\nThe problem statement provides the following information and foundational principles:\n\n*   **Activity:** A large academic hospital implements an evidence-based sepsis care bundle as a standard-of-care policy across all inpatient units.\n*   **Intervention:** The bundle elements are already recommended by national guidelines (early lactate measurement, timely blood cultures, prompt broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation).\n*   **Study Design:** No patient is randomized. No bundle element is withheld. Clinicians retain discretion to deviate if clinically necessary.\n*   **Data Collection:** The quality office will extract pre- and post-implementation outcome metrics (mortality, time-to-antibiotics, length of stay) from the electronic health record.\n*   **Data Handling:** The process will first use identifiable data for internal data quality validation, and then report only de-identified aggregate measures to leadership.\n*   **Primary Purpose:** To improve internal performance and patient outcomes at this hospital.\n*   **Secondary Intent:** The team anticipates submitting a report to a regional meeting if results are informative.\n*   **Foundational Principle 1 (Definition of Research):** Research, under the United States Common Rule (Title 45 Code of Federal Regulations Part 46), is defined as \"a systematic investigation designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.\"\n*   **Foundational Principle 2 (Definition of Human Subject):** A human subject is a living individual about whom an investigator obtains data through intervention or interaction, or obtains, uses, studies, analyzes, or generates identifiable private information.\n*   **Foundational Principle 3 (Role of IRB):** An Institutional Review Board (IRB) is a committee that protects the rights and welfare of human subjects in research.\n*   **Foundational Principle 4 (Distinction between QI and Research):** Quality improvement (QI) activities implementing accepted standards to improve local care, without introducing nonstandard interventions or randomizing patients, are typically healthcare operations, not research. Intent to publish alone does not transform non-research into research.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the validation criteria:\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly grounded in the established regulatory framework of the U.S. Common Rule (45 CFR 46) and the real-world domain of medical ethics and hospital quality improvement. The definitions provided are accurate restatements of federal regulations. The clinical scenario is realistic. The problem is scientifically sound.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a specific scenario and a set of explicit definitions and principles to be applied. It asks for a classification and recommendation, for which there is sufficient information to derive a logical and unique answer.\n*   **Objective:** The language is precise, descriptive, and free of bias or subjective claims. It presents a factual scenario for analysis.\n\nThe problem statement does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. It presents a standard, albeit nuanced, regulatory question that is solvable by applying the provided principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The analysis can proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem is to distinguish between \"human subjects research\" and \"quality improvement\" (QI) using the provided definitions.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the \"Research\" Definition:** The federal definition of research requires two components: a \"systematic investigation\" and a design \"to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge\".\n    *   The project is indeed a \"systematic investigation\" as it involves a pre-planned, methodical collection and analysis of data (pre- and post-implementation metrics).\n    *   However, the critical element is the *design* or *intent*. The problem explicitly states, \"The stated primary purpose is to improve internal performance and patient outcomes at this hospital.\" This aligns the project's design with local quality improvement, not the generation of generalizable knowledge. The foundational principles reinforce this, stating that activities implementing accepted standards for local care are typically healthcare operations. While there is a secondary intent to possibly publish, the same principles clarify that \"intent to publish alone does not transform non-research into research.\" Therefore, this activity does not meet the regulatory definition of \"research\".\n\n2.  **Analysis of the \"Human Subject\" Definition:** The definition of a human subject is contingent on the activity first being classified as research. Since the activity is not research, the Common Rule and its definitions of \"human subject\" and the consequent requirement for IRB review do not apply. The activity is properly categorized as a healthcare operation, which is governed by other rules such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for the use of patient data. The initial use of identifiable private information for internal data validation is permissible under HIPAA for healthcare operations.\n\n3.  **Determination of Oversight:**\n    *   Since the activity is not \"human subjects research,\" it does not fall under the jurisdiction of the IRB for review and approval. It should proceed under the an internal institutional quality governance structure.\n    *   However, the plan to potentially \"submit a report... to a regional meeting\" introduces a practical consideration. Many academic journals and conferences, as a matter of policy, require formal documentation from an IRB or an equivalent institutional body that an activity was determined *not* to constitute human subjects research. This is to ensure that the investigators did not simply bypass ethical oversight. Therefore, while not a legal requirement of the Common Rule, obtaining a formal determination letter is a prudent and necessary step to facilitate future dissemination of the findings.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Classify as research with human subjects and submit for full convened IRB review because the activity changes clinical care hospital-wide and involves patient data.**\nThis classification is incorrect. The activity's primary design is for local improvement, not generalizable knowledge, so it fails the definition of \"research.\" Merely changing care or using patient data does not automatically make an activity research; these are also characteristics of healthcare operations. Full convened IRB review is reserved for research involving more than minimal risk, which is unlikely here since the intervention is based on national guidelines for standard of care.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Classify as quality improvement under healthcare operations and proceed under institutional quality governance; before external dissemination, request an IRB or equivalent compliance office determination letter stating that the activity is not human subjects research.**\nThis option correctly classifies the activity as quality improvement (a form of healthcare operation) based on its primary purpose. It correctly places initial oversight under institutional quality governance. Most importantly, it addresses the practical challenge of future publication by recommending a formal determination letter from the IRB or a similar office. This letter would serve as official documentation that the project was appropriately deemed not to be human subjects research, satisfying potential journal or conference requirements. This is the most accurate and pragmatically complete course of action.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Classify as research eligible for expedited IRB review because it uses existing clinical data without interacting with patients; no determination letter is needed if the data are de-identified before analysis.**\nThis classification is incorrect because the activity does not meet the definition of \"research\" in the first place. The distinction between research and non-research must be made before considering review categories like \"expedited.\" Furthermore, the assertion that no determination letter is needed is practically unsound given the intent to publish. Many venues require such a letter regardless of the project's ultimate classification.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Classify as exempt research (secondary research use of data) and self-exempt without IRB involvement because only aggregate outcomes will be reported publicly.**\nThis classification is incorrect for multiple reasons. First, it is not \"research.\" Second, the practice of \"self-exemption\" is not recognized or is strongly discouraged by most institutions; determinations of exemption status are a function of the IRB or a designated office. The initial use of identifiable data for quality validation would also complicate a simple claim of exemption. The form of final reporting (aggregate) does not change the regulatory nature of the project itself.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Classify as quality improvement with no need to contact the IRB or any oversight body because the activity uses standard care and internal data only.**\nThis option correctly classifies the activity as QI. However, its recommendation is incomplete and potentially problematic. While IRB *review and approval* is not needed, foreseeing the possibility of external dissemination makes it highly advisable to contact the IRB or a compliance office for a formal \"Not Human Subjects Research\" determination. Failing to do so could create significant barriers to publishing or presenting the findings later. This option ignores this critical practical step.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4885216"}, {"introduction": "A core ethical duty of the IRB, derived from the principle of beneficence, is to ensure that the risks a study poses to participants are minimized and are reasonable in relation to any potential benefits.

As part of beneficence and risk minimization, an IRB uses a systematic risk assessment that considers both probability and severity of harms and seeks modifications to reduce risk when scientifically feasible without compromising validity.\n\nTwo scientifically adequate protocols are proposed, aiming to measure identical outcomes over 14 days in adults aged 30–65 with controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure < 140 mmHg on stable therapy for > 3 months).

Reject both protocols because any venipuncture causes more than minimal risk, irrespective of alternative mitigations.\n\nE. Approve both protocols but require randomization into the higher-risk Protocol X to ensure equitable distribution of risk across participants.", "solution": "Begin with the fundamental base. The Belmont Report’s principle of Beneficence requires maximizing possible benefits and minimizing possible harms. The Common Rule (45 CFR 46) defines minimal risk as those where the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort are not greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during routine examinations. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) operationalizes beneficence through systematic risk assessment and modification to reduce risk when scientifically feasible. When two protocols produce comparable scientific information, beneficence implies choosing the lower-risk alternative or mandating risk-reducing modifications to the higher-risk one. Respect for Persons requires that consent disclose foreseeable risks, including privacy/security, and Justice requires equitable selection independent of risk distribution tricks (e.g., forcing randomization into a higher-risk arm without necessity).\n\nTo compare the protocols, use a risk matrix that integrates probability ($p$) and magnitude ($m$) to form an expected disutility for each foreseeable harm and then aggregate across harms. This is consistent with first principles of decision-making under uncertainty: expected harm is the sum over harms of the product of probability and severity. Formally, the total expected risk score $D$ per participant is\n$$\nD = \\sum_{i} p_i \\cdot m_i,\n$$\nwhere $p_i$ is the probability of harm $i$ and $m_i$ is its severity score (minor $m=1$, moderate $m=3$, severe $m=7$). This is not a “shortcut” determinant of approval; it is a principled way to compare alternatives under Beneficence, which must still be interpreted in light of minimal risk, scientific necessity, and available mitigations.\n\nCompute the aggregate expected risk for Protocol X:\n\n- Skin irritation: $p=0.20$, $m=1$ gives $0.20 \\cdot 1 = 0.20$.\n- Sleep disturbance: $p=0.35$, $m=3$ gives $0.35 \\cdot 3 = 1.05$.\n- Discomfort episodes: $p=0.05$, $m=3$ gives $0.05 \\cdot 3 = 0.15$.\n- Nighttime fall: $p=0.01$, $m=7$ gives $0.01 \\cdot 7 = 0.07$.\n- Sodium headache: $p=0.15$, $m=1$ gives $0.15 \\cdot 1 = 0.15$.\n- Sodium edema: $p=0.05$, $m=3$ gives $0.05 \\cdot 3 = 0.15$.\n- Hypertensive crisis: $p=0.005$, $m=7$ gives $0.005 \\cdot 7 = 0.035$.\n- Venipuncture cumulative across 4 draws:\n  - Bruising: $p=0.30$, $m=1$ gives $0.30 \\cdot 1 = 0.30$.\n  - Vasovagal syncope: $p=0.08$, $m=3$ gives $0.08 \\cdot 3 = 0.24$.\n  - Infection: $p=0.004$, $m=7$ gives $0.004 \\cdot 7 = 0.028$.\n\nSum for Protocol X:\n$D_X = 0.20 + 1.05 + 0.15 + 0.07 + 0.15 + 0.15 + 0.035 + 0.30 + 0.24 + 0.028 = 2.373$.\n\nCompute the aggregate expected risk for Protocol Y (baseline system, then with privacy mitigation):\n\n- Anxiety: $0.25 \\cdot 1 = 0.25$.\n- Numbness: $0.05 \\cdot 1 = 0.05$.\n- Over-inflation error: $0.002 \\cdot 3 = 0.006$.\n- Skin bruise: $0.01 \\cdot 1 = 0.01$.\n- Wearable irritation: $0.10 \\cdot 1 = 0.10$.\n- Privacy breach baseline: $0.005 \\cdot 7 = 0.035$.\n- Venipuncture (single draw):\n  - Bruising: $p=0.10$, $m=1$ gives $0.10 \\cdot 1 = 0.10$.\n  - Vasovagal syncope: $p=0.02$, $m=3$ gives $0.02 \\cdot 3 = 0.06$.\n  - Infection: $p=0.001$, $m=7$ gives $0.001 \\cdot 7 = 0.007$.\n\nSum for Protocol Y, baseline privacy controls:\n$D_Y^{\\text{baseline}} = 0.25 + 0.05 + 0.006 + 0.01 + 0.10 + 0.035 + 0.10 + 0.06 + 0.007 = 0.618$.\n\nWith end-to-end encryption and access controls (reduced breach probability $p=0.001$):\n- Privacy breach mitigated: $0.001 \\cdot 7 = 0.007$ instead of $0.035$.\n\nThus,\n$D_Y^{\\text{mitigated}} = D_Y^{\\text{baseline}} - (0.035 - 0.007) = 0.618 - 0.028 = 0.590$.\n\nInterpretation under Beneficence and minimal risk:\n- $D_Y^{\\text{mitigated}} \\ll D_X$ ($0.590$ versus $2.373$), indicating Protocol Y presents substantially lower expected harm.\n- Many harms in Protocol X (sleep disturbance $m=3$, sodium load–related symptoms, and rare severe events) are plausibly greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life, particularly due to nighttime inflations and sodium challenge. Unless modified, Protocol X may exceed minimal risk for some participants.\n- Protocol Y’s harms, after privacy/security mitigation, largely align with everyday experiences (occasional anxiety, mild irritation, a single routine venipuncture). The severe privacy harm, while high magnitude, has very low probability with robust controls, which is a standard IRB mitigation to achieve minimal risk for informational harms.\n- Scientific equivalence means there is no necessity to accept higher risk to achieve the study aims. Therefore, the IRB should prefer the lower-risk method and require modifications when they can reduce risk without undermining validity.\n\nRespect for Persons further requires explicit consent language describing data risks and protections (especially for continuous sensor data), and Justice does not justify randomization into a higher-risk arm when a lower-risk alternative is adequate for the same outcome. The IRB should also consider operational safety measures (e.g., overnight safety checks for ABPM, exclusion criteria for fall risk) if Protocol X is to be modified.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- A. Incorrect. Protocol X, as submitted, has a higher aggregate expected risk ($D_X = 2.373$) with moderate and severe harms (sleep disturbance, sodium-related adverse effects, rare hypertensive crises, fall risk). Given a scientifically comparable lower-risk alternative, approving X unmodified violates beneficence and likely exceeds minimal risk for some participants.\n- B. Incorrect. Protocol Y is lower risk, but approval “as submitted” ignores the informational privacy risk where the severe magnitude ($m=7$) requires robust mitigation. Standard IRB practice is to require end-to-end encryption, access controls, data minimization, and clear consent language to bring informational risks within minimal risk. Without these, minimal risk may not be met.\n- C. Correct. This action implements beneficence by approving the lower-risk protocol with appropriate privacy and consent safeguards, and requires risk-reducing modifications to the higher-risk protocol (remove sodium challenge, reduce/eliminate nighttime inflations, add safety checks, and adjust inclusion criteria). If X cannot be modified to minimal risk while maintaining scientific adequacy, it should not be approved because the same outcome can be achieved at lower risk via Y.\n- D. Incorrect. Venipuncture is ordinarily considered minimal risk when performed with standard precautions; categorical rejection disregards the Common Rule’s minimal risk framework and available mitigations.\n- E. Incorrect. Justice does not entail assigning participants to a higher-risk protocol without necessity. Randomization into a higher-risk arm is unethical when a lower-risk method achieves the same aims; equitable selection refers to fair inclusion across populations, not forced risk exposure.\n\nTherefore, the IRB’s ethically appropriate action is to approve Protocol Y with specified risk mitigations and require modifications to Protocol X to reduce risk; absent feasible modifications, Protocol X should not be approved because a lower-risk alternative exists for the same outcome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4885180"}, {"introduction": "An IRB's responsibility for participant safety does not end when a study is approved; it extends throughout the entire duration of the research.

The solution will proceed by analyzing the events against the regulatory criteria and then evaluating the given options.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe core of this problem rests on the definition of a UPIRTSO and the distinct reporting requirements of OHRP and the FDA.\n\n**Definition of a UPIRTSO**\nAccording to OHRP guidance, an incident, experience, or outcome is a UPIRTSO if it meets all three of the following criteria:\n1.  It is **unanticipated** (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given the research procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents (e.g., IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document).\n2.  It is **related or possibly related** to participation in the research (meaning there is a reasonable possibility that the incident may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research).\n3.  It suggests that the research places subjects or others at a **greater risk of harm** (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.\n\n**Analysis of Each Event against UPIRTSO Criteria:**\n\n- **Event $E1$ (Mild Dizziness at $8\\%$):**\n    - **Unanticipated?** No. The problem explicitly states the event is \"consistent with the consent language and investigator brochure\" and \"No change in risk profile is suggested.\" Although the frequency ($8\\%$) might be noteworthy, the event's nature and severity are exactly as described. It fails this first criterion.\n    - **Conclusion**: $E1$ is **not a UPIRTSO**.\n\n- **Event $E2$ (Life-threatening Hepatic Failure):**\n    - **Unanticipated?** Yes. The problem states that hepatic failure of this severity \"was not described in the protocol or consent.\"\n    - **Related?** Yes. It was judged as \"probably related to the study drug.\"\n    - **Suggests Greater Risk?** Yes. A previously unknown, life-threatening event \"suggests the possibility of greater-than-recognized risk.\"\n    - **Conclusion**: $E2$ **is a UPIRTSO**.\n\n- **Event $E3$ (PHI Breach):**\n    - **Unanticipated?** Yes. A protocol does not anticipate or plan for a large-scale breach of confidentiality.\n    - **Related?** Yes. The breach was a direct result of activity conducted for the research (handling subject data).\n    - **Suggests Greater Risk?** Yes. The problem states there is \"substantial risk of privacy harm and potential reputational or financial harm.\" This falls under the definition of harm, which is not limited to physical injury.\n    - **Conclusion**: $E3$ **is a UPIRTSO**.\n\n- **Event $E4$ (Moderate Hyperkalemia Cluster at $5\\%$):**\n    - **Unanticipated?** Yes. The anticipated risk was \"rare mild hyperkalemia at approximately $1\\%$.\" What was observed was \"moderate\" hyperkalemia (a change in severity) in $5\\%$ of participants (a change in frequency). This is unanticipated.\n    - **Related?** Yes. The events were judged as \"probably related to the drug.\"\n    - **Suggests Greater Risk?** Yes. The increased frequency and severity, requiring emergency department visits, indicates a greater risk of harm than was previously understood.\n    - **Conclusion**: $E4$ **is a UPIRTSO**.\n\n**Summary of Reporting Requirements:**\nFor events that are UPIRTSOs ($E2, E3, E4$), specific reporting is required.\n\n1.  **Investigator to IRB**: The investigator must report all potential UPIRTSOs to the IRB. The timeline is typically \"promptly,\" as defined by institutional policy. For severe events like $E2$, this is extremely urgent (e.g., within $24-48$ hours). For others, it may be within $5-10$ business days.\n2.  **IRB to OHRP**: Once the IRB reviews and confirms an event is a UPIRTSO, it must report it \"promptly\" to OHRP, appropriate institutional officials, and the head of the sponsoring agency (if any). A timeframe of one month is a common institutional standard for completing the review and making the formal report.\n3.  **Sponsor to FDA (for IND trials)**: This is a separate pathway for adverse drug experiences.\n    - **7-day IND Safety Report**: Required for adverse experiences associated with the drug that are both **serious** (e.g., life-threatening, resulting in death, requiring hospitalization) and **unexpected** (not consistent with the investigator brochure).\n    - **15-day IND Safety Report**: Required for serious, *expected* adverse experiences; for serious, unexpected experiences that don't meet the 7-day criteria; or for an increase in the rate of occurrence of serious, expected adverse experiences.\n    - Privacy breaches ($E3$) are not adverse drug experiences and are not reported to the FDA via this mechanism.\n\n**Application to $E2, E3, E4$**:\n\n- **For $E2$ (Hepatic Failure)**: This is a UPIRTSO. It is also a **serious and unexpected** adverse experience.\n    - Investigator -> IRB: Urgently (e.g., within $24$ hours).\n    - IRB -> OHRP: Promptly (e.g., within $1$ month).\n    - Sponsor -> FDA: **7-day IND Safety Report**.\n    - DSMB: Prompt notification.\n\n- **For $E3$ (PHI Breach)**: This is a UPIRTSO. It is not an adverse drug experience.\n    - Investigator -> IRB: Promptly (e.g., within $10$ days).\n    - IRB -> OHRP: Promptly (e.g., within $1$ month).\n    - Sponsor -> FDA: No IND Safety Report required.\n    - Other: Institutional Privacy/Compliance office must be notified.\n\n- **For $E4$ (Hyperkalemia Cluster)**: This is a UPIRTSO. It represents an increased frequency and severity of a known adverse experience. Since it required ED visits, it would be considered medically significant and thus \"serious\" for reporting purposes.\n    - Investigator -> IRB: Promptly (e.g., within $10$ days).\n    - IRB -> OHRP: Promptly (e.g., within $1$ month).\n    - Sponsor -> FDA: The increase in rate of a serious, expected adverse event warrants a **15-day IND Safety Report**.\n    - DSMB: Prompt notification.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $E2$, $E3$, and $E4$ meet UPIRTSO criteria. For $E2$: Investigator reports to the IRB within $24$ hours; IRB reports to OHRP, appropriate institutional officials, and the Department or Agency head within $1$ month; sponsor submits an IND safety report to FDA within $7$ calendar days; DSMB is notified promptly. For $E3$: Investigator reports to the IRB promptly within $10$ days; IRB reports to OHRP and institutional officials within $1$ month; institutional privacy/compliance office is notified; FDA submission is not required because this is not an adverse reaction. For $E4$: Investigator reports to the IRB promptly within $10$ days; IRB reports to OHRP and institutional officials within $1$ month; sponsor submits an IND safety report to FDA within $15$ calendar days; DSMB is notified.**\n- **Evaluation**: This option correctly identifies $E2$, $E3$, and $E4$ as UPIRTSOs. The reporting pathways and timelines described for each event are entirely consistent with the regulatory framework analysis above. The distinction between FDA and OHRP reporting is correctly handled.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Only $E2$ meets UPIRTSO criteria. The investigator should report $E2$ exclusively to the sponsor for FDA submission within $7$ days and defer IRB reporting until continuing review; $E1$, $E3$, and $E4$ are routine and need no immediate reporting to the IRB or OHRP.**\n- **Evaluation**: This option is incorrect on multiple counts. It incorrectly classifies $E3$ and $E4$ as not being UPIRTSOs. It incorrectly states that the investigator should report exclusively to the sponsor and defer IRB reporting; immediate reporting of potential UPIRTSOs to the IRB is a primary obligation.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $E1$ and $E2$ meet UPIRTSO criteria. Both must be reported to the IRB within $48$ hours; the sponsor submits an IND safety report for $E2$ within $15$ days; IRB reporting to OHRP may be delayed up to $3$ months because internal IRB review suffices; $E3$ and $E4$ are not UPIRTSO.**\n- **Evaluation**: This option incorrectly classifies $E1$ as a UPIRTSO and incorrectly classifies $E3$ and $E4$ as not being UPIRTSOs. It specifies an incorrect FDA reporting timeline for $E2$ (it should be $7$ days, not $15$). The suggestion that IRB reporting to OHRP can be delayed for $3$ months is contrary to the \"promptly\" guidance.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $E2$ and $E4$ meet UPIRTSO criteria, but the investigator may wait $14$ days to notify the IRB; IRB reporting to OHRP is not required because the IRB retains local oversight; the sponsor should not notify FDA for $E4$ because hyperkalemia was described in the protocol as a possible risk.**\n- **Evaluation**: This option incorrectly omits $E3$ as a UPIRTSO. It suggests an unacceptably long reporting time ($14$ days) to the IRB for a life-threatening event ($E2$). It incorrectly states that IRB reporting to OHRP is not required; this is a mandatory step for confirmed UPIRTSOs. It incorrectly states the sponsor should not notify the FDA for $E4$; the change in frequency and severity makes it a reportable event.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4885152"}]}
