The ethical principles of reciprocity and distributive justice argue that society has a duty to support those who make such sacrifices, paying special attention to the needs of the most vulnerable. This practice provides a concrete method for translating these abstract principles into a quantitative policy assessment, allowing you to rigorously evaluate whether a given compensation program is adequate and just. [@problem_id:4875676]", "problem": "A jurisdiction seeks to uphold the ethical principles of reciprocity and distributive justice in pandemic preparedness by compensating workers placed under legally mandated quarantine. Reciprocity requires that when individuals bear restrictions for the public’s benefit, society owes them support; distributive justice requires that this support be sufficient to protect basic needs and be sensitive to vulnerability. To formalize these principles for assessment, treat the compensation program as ethically adequate to the extent that it covers each worker’s essential expenditures over the quarantine period, with greater ethical weight for more vulnerable workers.\n\nThe compensation policy is as follows.\n\n- Formal salaried workers receive a wage replacement of $70\\%$ of their average daily wage for the first $10$ days of quarantine after a $3$-day waiting period with no pay, and $50\\%$ thereafter. There is a daily cap of $\\$120$. Average daily wage equals average weekly wage divided by $7$.\n- Gig workers receive $60\\%$ of their average daily income with a daily cap of $\\$80$ and no waiting period. In addition, they receive a child top-up of $\\$10$ per day per dependent child, up to $2$ children.\n- Informal workers receive a flat stipend of $\\$50$ per day plus a food voucher of $\\$8$ per day, with no cap and no waiting period.\n\nEssential needs are operationalized as a sufficiency threshold equal to a per-adult essential cost of $\\$40$ per day and a per-child essential cost of $\\$15$ per day. For a worker $i$ with $a_i$ adults and $c_i$ children in the household, and quarantine duration $d_i$ (in days), the total essential cost over quarantine is the product of daily need $\\$40 \\times a_i + \\$15 \\times c_i$ and $d_i$. A worker’s shortfall is the nonnegative difference between total essential cost and total compensation. To reflect prioritarian concern for the worse off, assign vulnerability weights $w_{\\mathrm{formal}} = 1$, $w_{\\mathrm{gig}} = 1.5$, and $w_{\\mathrm{informal}} = 2$.\n\nThree workers are quarantined.\n\n- Worker F (formal): average weekly wage $\\$900$, quarantine duration $14$ days, household of $a_F = 1$ adult and $c_F = 0$ children.\n- Worker G (gig): average weekly income $\\$700$, quarantine duration $14$ days, household of $a_G = 1$ adult and $c_G = 2$ children.\n- Worker I (informal): quarantine duration $10$ days, household of $a_I = 1$ adult and $c_I = 3$ children.\n\nCompute, from first principles, each worker’s total compensation over their quarantine, then determine each worker’s shortfall relative to their total essential cost. Define the vulnerability-weighted adequacy score to be one minus the ratio of the sum of vulnerability-weighted shortfalls to the sum of vulnerability-weighted essential costs across the three workers.

Ethical guidance in pandemic preparedness draws from widely accepted principles: maximize total benefit (beneficence and utility), respect fairness and equity (priority to the worse-off), and minimize harm (nonmaleficence). One operationalization is to assign each patient a priority score that integrates three ethically grounded, measurable components:\n\n- Predicted chance of survival to hospital discharge with ventilator support, denoted by $p_i \\in [0,1]$.\n- Expected remaining life-years conditional on survival, denoted by $y_i > 0$ (in years).\n- A standardized disadvantage index reflecting ethically salient equity considerations (e.g., high exposure risk due to essential work, structural disadvantage), denoted by $d_i \\in [0,1]$, with larger values indicating greater ethical priority for equity.\n\nStarting from these components as the fundamental base, construct a priority score $S_i$ as an additive function that assigns nonnegative weights to benefit and equity, then use it to allocate ventilators by ranking patients in descending order of $S_i$.
