The population is stratified into $5$ income quintiles, and the agency evaluates outcomes in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY). The agency is considering the following two plans:\nPlan T (Total-maximizing): Produces a population total of $100{,}000$ QALYs. In this plan, the bottom quintile’s average per-person QALYs increase from $10.0$ to $10.5$. Under this plan, the bottom quintile remains the worst-off group, with all other quintiles above $10.5$ QALYs.\nPlan E (Equity-boosting): Produces a population total of $95{,}000$ QALYs. In this plan, the bottom quintile’s average per-person QALYs increase from $10.0$ to $12.0$ (a $20\\%$ increase). Under this plan, the bottom quintile remains the worst-off group, with all other quintiles above $12.0$ QALYs.\n\nAssume the agency is choosing under two competing ethical decision rules grounded in foundational principles:\n1. Utilitarianism: Choose the policy that maximizes the sum of individual welfare, here operationalized as the total QALYs accrued by the population.\n2. The maximin principle (from John Rawls): Choose the policy that maximizes the welfare level of the worst-off group; formally, among feasible policies, select the one with the higher minimum group outcome.\n\nBased only on these core definitions and the data provided, which statement correctly identifies which plan each ethical rule would favor?\n\nA. Utilitarianism favors Plan T; maximin favors Plan E.\n\nB. Both utilitarianism and maximin favor Plan T because it yields a higher total number of QALYs.\n\nC. Utilitarianism favors Plan E due to diminishing marginal utility to QALYs; maximin favors Plan T because it benefits most people overall.\n\nD. Maximin is indifferent between the plans because both improve the bottom quintile; utilitarianism favors Plan E because it targets the worst-off with a $20\\%$ increase.", "solution": "The problem statement is a well-posed exercise in applied ethics and decision theory. It provides clear definitions for two ethical frameworks and sufficient data to apply them. It is scientifically grounded in the formalisms of public health ethics and economics, and it is free from inconsistencies or ambiguities.\n\nThe task is to determine which vaccination plan, Plan T or Plan E, would be favored by each of two distinct ethical decision rules: utilitarianism and the maximin principle.\n\n**1. Analysis under Utilitarianism**\n\nThe problem defines utilitarianism as the rule to \"Choose the policy that maximizes the sum of individual welfare, here operationalized as the total QALYs accrued by the population.\"\n\nTo apply this rule, we compare the total QALYs produced by each plan:\n-   Total QALYs from Plan T: $100{,}000$\n-   Total QALYs from Plan E: $95{,}000$\n\nComparing these two values, we find that $100{,}000 > 95{,}000$.\nTherefore, according to the principle of utilitarianism as defined, Plan T is the superior choice because it generates a greater total amount of welfare (QALYs) for the population as a whole.\n\n**2. Analysis under the Maximin Principle**\n\nThe problem defines the maximin principle as the rule to \"Choose the policy that maximizes the welfare level of the worst-off group\".\n\nThe problem specifies that the population is stratified into $5$ quintiles and that for both plans, \"the bottom quintile remains the worst-off group.\" This identifies the bottom quintile as the group whose welfare we must seek to maximize. The welfare level is given by the average per-person QALYs for that group.\n\nTo apply this rule, we compare the average per-person QALYs for the worst-off group under each plan:\n-   Worst-off group's welfare level in Plan T: $10.5$ QALYs\n-   Worst-off group's welfare level in Plan E: $12.0$ QALYs\n\nComparing these two outcomes, we find that $12.0 > 10.5$.\nTherefore, according to the maximin principle, Plan E is the superior choice because it produces a better outcome for the worst-off group.\n\n**Summary of Conclusions**\n-   Utilitarianism favors Plan T.\n-   The maximin principle favors Plan E.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Options**\n\nNow, we evaluate each of the given options based on this analysis.\n\n**A. Utilitarianism favors Plan T; maximin favors Plan E.**\nThis statement perfectly aligns with our derived conclusions. Utilitarianism chooses Plan T for its higher total QALYs ($100{,}000$), and maximin chooses Plan E for its higher floor of welfare ($12.0$ QALYs) for the worst-off group.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Both utilitarianism and maximin favor Plan T because it yields a higher total number of QALYs.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While utilitarianism does favor Plan T for its higher total QALYs, maximin does not. The maximin principle is not concerned with total QALYs but with the welfare of the worst-off group. As established, maximin favors Plan E.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Utilitarianism favors Plan E due to diminishing marginal utility to QALYs; maximin favors Plan T because it benefits most people overall.**\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. First, the problem's definition of utilitarianism is strictly about maximizing the sum of QALYs, not about any unstated assumptions like diminishing marginal utility. Based on the given definition, utilitarianism favors Plan T. Second, the maximin principle is explicitly concerned with the welfare of the *worst-off* group, not with what \"benefits most people overall.\" It favors Plan E, not Plan T. The reasoning provided for both principles is flawed.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Maximin is indifferent between the plans because both improve the bottom quintile; utilitarianism favors Plan E because it targets the worst-off with a $20\\%$ increase.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The maximin principle is not about mere improvement; it is about *maximization* of the minimum level. Since $12.0$ is strictly greater than $10.5$, maximin has a definite preference for Plan E and is not indifferent. Furthermore, utilitarianism, as defined, is indifferent to the distribution of welfare and the targeting of specific groups; it is concerned only with the total sum. It favors Plan T, not Plan E, because $100{,}000 > 95{,}000$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4862423"}, {"introduction": "When public funds are limited, choosing which health programs to support becomes a critical ethical challenge rooted in the principle of stewardship.

In the agency’s planning model, population health is measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), defined as life years weighted by health-related quality of life on the interval $[0,1]$ and aggregated across individuals; resource scarcity implies that any adoption displaces some existing services, incurring an opportunity cost.

It provides all necessary data and defines the key principle (LRM) to be used, avoiding ambiguity.\n\nThe problem does not violate any criteria for invalidity. It is self-contained, logically consistent, and formalizable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem is the application of the least restrictive means (LRM) principle. The principle is explicitly defined as choosing the least restrictive option from the set of *effective* options. Therefore, the analysis must proceed in two stages:\n1.  Determine which of the available policies are *effective* at meeting the public health goal.\n2.  From that subset of effective policies, select the one that is the *least restrictive*.\n\n**1. Determine Effective Policies**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The current vaccination coverage is $80\\%$.\n*   **Goal State:** The target vaccination coverage is at least $95\\%$.\n*   **Required Increase:** The health department needs to increase coverage by at least $95\\% - 80\\% = 15$ percentage points.\n\nWe now evaluate each policy's effectiveness:\n\n*   **Education:** This policy yields a $5\\%$ incremental increase. The projected final coverage would be $80\\% + 5\\% = 85\\%$. Since $85\\% < 95\\%$, this policy is **not effective**.\n*   **Nudges:** This policy yields a $10\\%$ incremental increase. The projected final coverage would be $80\\% + 10\\% = 90\\%$. Since $90\\% < 95\\%$, this policy is **not effective**.\n*   **Incentives:** This policy yields a $20\\%$ incremental increase. The projected final coverage would be $80\\% + 20\\% = 100\\%$. Since $100\\% \\ge 95\\%$, this policy is **effective**.\n*   **Mandates:** This policy yields a $30\\%$ incremental increase. The projected final coverage would be $80\\% + 30\\% = 110\\%$. While a coverage rate over $100\\%$ is not physically possible, we interpret this high estimate from the model as being more than sufficient to reach the goal. A realistic cap would be $100\\%$. Since $100\\% \\ge 95\\%$, this policy is **effective**.\n\nThe set of effective policies is therefore {Incentives, Mandates}.\n\n**2. Select the Least Restrictive Means**\n\nThe LRM principle dictates that we must choose the least restrictive option from the set of effective policies. The problem explicitly provides the hierarchy of restrictiveness:\nEducation < Nudges < Incentives < Mandates\n\nComparing the two effective policies, 'Incentives' and 'Mandates', 'Incentives' is the less restrictive policy. Therefore, according to the LRM principle, the department must select 'Incentives'.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. Launch a citywide education campaign only**\n    This policy would raise coverage to $85\\%$. This is insufficient to meet the goal of $\\ge 95\\%$. The LRM principle requires a policy to be effective before it can be chosen. Since this option is not effective, it is not a valid choice.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B. Implement nudges that schedule default vaccination appointments and send reminders**\n    This policy would raise coverage to $90\\%$. This is also insufficient to meet the goal of $\\ge 95\\%$. As the policy is not effective, it must be rejected under the LRM framework.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Offer financial or material incentives for vaccination**\n    This policy would raise coverage to $100\\%$, which meets and exceeds the goal of $\\ge 95\\%$. It is therefore an effective policy. The LRM principle requires selecting the least restrictive policy *among the effective options*. The effective options are Incentives and Mandates. As Incentives are less restrictive than Mandates, this is the correct choice according to the LRM principle.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **D. Impose a vaccination mandate with penalties for noncompliance**\n    This policy would raise coverage to a level that meets the goal of $\\ge 95\\%$. It is an effective policy. However, it is not the *least restrictive* effective policy. The 'Incentives' policy is also effective and is less restrictive. The LRM principle requires the department to choose the less burdensome option ('Incentives') before escalating to a more burdensome one ('Mandates').\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4862520"}]}
