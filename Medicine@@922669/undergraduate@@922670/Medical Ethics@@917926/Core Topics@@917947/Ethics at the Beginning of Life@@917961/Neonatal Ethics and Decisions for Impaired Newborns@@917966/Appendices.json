This first practice grounds the abstract principles of ethics in concrete data by asking you to calculate the probability of the most hoped-for outcome: intact survival.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient, consistent information to derive a solution. The problem requires a primary calculation based on foundational probability theory and a subsequent application of that result to a standard framework in biomedical ethics, a task appropriate for a quantitative discipline related to medicine.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested: first, the derivation and computation of the required probability, and second, an explanation of its role in ethical deliberation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Computation of Probability**\n\nWe are asked to compute the probability that the infant will be both alive at hospital discharge and neurologically intact at $2$ years, given that full resuscitation is attempted. Let us define the relevant events:\n\nLet $S$ be the event that the infant survives to hospital discharge.\nLet $N$ be the event that the infant is neurologically intact at $2$ years of age.\n\nThe problem provides the following probabilities, all conditioned on the decision to attempt full resuscitation:\n1. The probability of survival to hospital discharge is given as $P(S) = 0.30$.\n2. The probability of being neurologically intact at $2$ years, *among those who survive to discharge*, is given as $P(N|S) = 0.40$. This is a conditional probability: the probability of event $N$ occurring given that event $S$ has already occurred.\n\nWe are asked to find the probability of the joint occurrence of both events, i.e., the infant survives to discharge *and* is neurologically intact. This corresponds to the probability of the intersection of events $S$ and $N$, denoted as $P(S \\cap N)$.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation to start from the definition of conditional probability. The conditional probability of an event $A$ given an event $B$ is defined as:\n$$\nP(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\n$$\nprovided that $P(B) > 0$.\n\nTo find the probability of the joint event $A \\cap B$, we can rearrange this definition to obtain the product rule for joint events:\n$$\nP(A \\cap B) = P(A|B) P(B)\n$$\nWe can apply this rule directly to our defined events. By substituting $A$ with $N$ and $B$ with $S$, we get:\n$$\nP(N \\cap S) = P(N|S) P(S)\n$$\nSince the intersection of two events is commutative ($N \\cap S$ is the same event as $S \\cap N$), we have:\n$$\nP(S \\cap N) = P(N|S) P(S)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this equation:\n$P(S) = 0.30$\n$P(N|S) = 0.40$\n\n$$\nP(S \\cap N) = (0.40) \\times (0.30) = 0.12\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, the computed probability is $0.120$.\n\n**Part 2: Application to Ethical Deliberation**\n\nThe computed probability of $P(S \\cap N) = 0.120$ (a $12.0\\%$ chance) represents the likelihood of achieving the most desired outcome—intact survival—if resuscitation is pursued. This single value is a critical piece of objective data that informs the ethical discussion with the parents, structured around the core principles of biomedical ethics, particularly within the decisional \"gray zone\" where outcomes are highly uncertain.\n\n1.  **Beneficence (to do good) and Non-maleficence (to do no harm):** These two principles are weighed against each other. The potential \"good\" (beneficence) is the $12.0\\%$ chance of intact survival. The potential \"harm\" (non-maleficence) is substantial. The probability of *not* surviving despite resuscitative efforts is $P(S^c) = 1 - P(S) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$, or $70\\%$. Furthermore, the probability of surviving with moderate-to-severe neurodevelopmental impairment is $P(S \\cap N^c) = P(N^c|S)P(S) = (1 - P(N|S))P(S) = (1 - 0.40)(0.30) = (0.60)(0.30) = 0.18$, or $18\\%$. Thus, the total probability of an adverse outcome (death or survival with significant impairment) following a decision to resuscitate is $P(S^c) + P(S \\cap N^c) = 0.70 + 0.18 = 0.88$, or $88\\%$. The ethical deliberation must balance the small chance of a good outcome against a very large chance of death or significant disability, both of which are preceded by invasive and potentially painful medical interventions.\n\n2.  **Respect for Parental Autonomy:** The computed probabilities are essential for shared, informed decision-making. Presenting the data objectively—\"$12.0\\%$ chance of survival without major disability, $18\\%$ chance of survival with major disability, and $70\\%$ chance of not surviving\"—empowers parents to make a choice that aligns with their personal values, beliefs, and goals for their child and family. Some parents may view a $12.0\\%$ chance as hope worth fighting for, while others may view the $88\\%$ chance of a poor outcome as a compelling reason to choose comfort care, prioritizing the avoidance of suffering for their infant. Autonomy requires that the parents, as the primary surrogate decision-makers, are the ones to weigh these probabilities.\n\n3.  **Best Interests Standard:** This standard requires choosing the path that is in the best interest of the infant. The probability calculation highlights the difficulty of applying this standard. Is it in the infant's best interest to undergo painful interventions for a $1 \\text{ in } 8$ chance of intact survival? Or is it in the infant's best interest to be held, kept warm, and allowed a peaceful passing? The low probability of the ideal outcome, $0.120$, makes it ethically defensible to argue that aggressive resuscitation may not be in the infant's best interest because the burdens of treatment are nearly certain while the chance of a favorable benefit is low. The probability quantifies the deep uncertainty, reinforcing why this is a \"gray zone\" and why parental values are so critical in defining what \"best interest\" means for their child.\n\nIn summary, the computed probability of $0.120$ does not dictate a course of action but rather serves as an indispensable tool for framing the clinical and ethical realities, enabling a reasoned and humane discussion that respects the profound difficulty of the decision.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.120}$$", "id": "4873018"}, {"introduction": "While the first exercise used probability to inform a qualitative discussion, this practice introduces a formal framework for comparing choices: Expected Utility Theory.

Two options are being considered: mechanical ventilation (MV) and comfort care (CC).

The objective is clearly stated, and a unique solution can be computed.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, formal language. The utility values are explicitly defined as assignments from an ethics committee, which is consistent with the application of utility theory, where utilities are subjective preferences that must be elicited and specified for the model.\n\nThe problem formulation is complete, consistent, and logically sound, admitting a unique and meaningful solution. Therefore, the solution process can proceed.\n\n### Solution\nThe expected utility of a course of action is calculated as the sum of the utilities of all possible outcomes, with each utility weighted by its corresponding probability. The formula for the expected utility $U$ of an action is given by the law of total expectation:\n$$\nU = \\sum_{i} P(O_i) u(O_i)\n$$\nwhere $O_i$ represents the $i$-th outcome, $P(O_i)$ is its probability, and $u(O_i)$ is its utility.\n\nLet the set of outcomes be $\\{W, I, D\\}$, representing survival without impairment, survival with severe impairment, and death, respectively. The given utilities are $u_W = 1.00$, $u_I = 0.20$, and $u_D = 0$.\n\nFirst, we compute the expected utility of mechanical ventilation, $U_{\\mathrm{MV}}$. The probabilities of the outcomes under MV are given as $P(W|\\mathrm{MV}) = 0.20$, $P(I|\\mathrm{MV}) = 0.30$, and $P(D|\\mathrm{MV}) = 0.50$.\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{MV}} = P(W|\\mathrm{MV}) \\cdot u_W + P(I|\\mathrm{MV}) \\cdot u_I + P(D|\\mathrm{MV}) \\cdot u_D\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{MV}} = (0.20)(1.00) + (0.30)(0.20) + (0.50)(0)\n$$\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{MV}} = 0.20 + 0.06 + 0\n$$\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{MV}} = 0.26\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the expected utility of comfort care, $U_{\\mathrm{CC}}$. The probabilities of the outcomes under CC are given as $P(I|\\mathrm{CC}) = 0.05$ and $P(D|\\mathrm{CC}) = 0.95$. Since these sum to $1.00$, the probability of survival without impairment, $P(W|\\mathrm{CC})$, is implicitly $0$.\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{CC}} = P(W|\\mathrm{CC}) \\cdot u_W + P(I|\\mathrm{CC}) \\cdot u_I + P(D|\\mathrm{CC}) \\cdot u_D\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{CC}} = (0)(1.00) + (0.05)(0.20) + (0.95)(0)\n$$\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{CC}} = 0 + 0.01 + 0\n$$\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{CC}} = 0.01\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the net expected utility difference, $\\Delta U$, defined as $\\Delta U = U_{\\mathrm{MV}} - U_{\\mathrm{CC}}$.\n$$\n\\Delta U = 0.26 - 0.01\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta U = 0.25\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal number rounded to four significant figures.

The discretionary quarterly budget of $B = \\$2{,}400{,}000$ earmarked for high-cost therapies. An infant, $1$ week old, has been diagnosed through newborn screening with Spinal Muscular Atrophy type $1$ and is eligible for a single-dose gene therapy priced at $C = \\$2{,}100{,}000$, with anticipated additional immediate supportive care costs of $S = \\$150{,}000$, for a total $C_{\\text{total}} = \\$2{,}250{,}000$.

The same funds, if not spent on this single therapy, would be allocated to a bundle of proven neonatal interventions: expanded antenatal corticosteroid access for threatened preterm labor, continuous positive airway pressure devices, infection prevention bundles, and early breastfeeding support, collectively estimated (by HTA) to yield $E_{\\text{pop}}\\approx 70$ QALYs spread across $M=150$ infants over the next year.\n\nClinicians and administrators face a conflict between beneficence (acting in the best interests of the individual infant) and justice (fair distribution of benefits and burdens across the neonatal population).

It presents a scientifically and factually grounded scenario in medical ethics and health resource allocation. The data provided are consistent and plausible, setting up a well-posed ethical dilemma. The terminologies used (QALY, HTA, SMA type $1$, A4R) are standard within the relevant fields. The problem is objective and contains sufficient information to allow for a reasoned analysis based on the specified ethical frameworks.\n\nThe core of the problem is a conflict between the ethical principles of beneficence for an identifiable individual and distributive justice for a larger population, given a scarce resource. The discretionary budget is $B = \\$2{,}400{,}000$. The high-cost gene therapy for one infant with Spinal Muscular Atrophy type $1$ has a total cost of $C_{\\text{total}} = \\$2{,}250{,}000$, consuming $93.75\\%$ of the budget. The expected benefit for this infant is $p \\times q = 0.7 \\times 14 = 9.8$ Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). The alternative use of the same funds is a bundle of interventions for $M=150$ infants, expected to yield a total of $E_{\\text{pop}}\\approx 70$ QALYs.\n\nA simple cost-utility analysis reveals a stark difference. The cost per QALY for the gene therapy is $C_{\\text{total}} / (p \\times q) = \\$2,250,000 / 9.8 \\approx \\$229,592$ per QALY.

From a purely utilitarian perspective aimed at maximizing health outcomes for the available budget, the population bundle is significantly superior.\n\nHowever, the problem requires a resolution grounded not only in such calculations but also in the Four Principles of Biomedical Ethics (beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy, justice) and a fair process like Accountability for Reasonableness (A4R). A robust ethical resolution must balance these competing considerations rather than prioritizing one to the absolute exclusion of others.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Prioritize beneficence and the “rule of rescue” for the identifiable infant; approve the gene therapy immediately, using nearly all of $B$ despite the opportunity cost to the wider population, because saving a visible life must override distributive concerns.**\nThis option champions the principle of beneficence for the single infant and the \"rule of rescue,\" the compelling urge to save an identifiable person in peril. However, it completely disregards the principle of justice. In a publicly funded system, decision-makers have a fiduciary duty to the entire population they serve. Ignoring the opportunity cost—the loss of $E_{\\text{pop}}\\approx 70$ QALYs for $M=150$ other infants—is ethically indefensible and unsustainable as a policy. It fails to engage in the reasoned balancing of principles required by the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Apply strict utilitarian maximization of QALYs; deny the gene therapy categorically and adopt a policy that excludes infants with severe impairments from high-cost treatments to preserve resources for population-level gains.**\nThis option represents a pure utilitarian approach. While it correctly identifies that the population bundle provides greater aggregate benefit ($70$ QALYs vs. $9.8$ QALYs), it is ethically problematic for other reasons. A categorical exclusion of patients based on their diagnosis or the cost of their treatment can be seen as discriminatory and unjust. The A4R framework requires that reasons be acceptable to \"fair-minded\" people, and a blanket exclusion policy may fail this test, as it ignores the ethical weight given to the severity of illness and the \"concern for the worst-off,\" which are also relevant criteria. This approach is rigid and lacks compassion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Use a transparent Accountability for Reasonableness (A4R) priority-setting process with publicly defensible criteria (clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, urgency/severity, and concern for the worst-off); evaluate whether the case meets an exceptional-threshold justification while preserving funding for the population bundle, seek alternative funding streams for the gene therapy, provide time-sensitive supportive care, and, if the therapy is not approved, ensure comprehensive neonatal palliative care and offer an appeals process.**\nThis option provides a comprehensive, process-oriented solution that directly applies the A4R framework mentioned in the problem. It proposes balancing multiple relevant criteria (effectiveness, cost-effectiveness for justice; urgency, severity, and concern for the worst-off for beneficence and equity). It suggests a nuanced policy of an \"exceptional-threshold justification,\" which avoids the absolutism of options A and B. It also incorporates crucial practical and compassionate actions: seeking alternative funding to resolve the conflict, providing necessary supportive care regardless of the decision, ensuring comprehensive palliative care as a default standard of care, and offering an appeals process. These elements—publicity, relevance of criteria, appeal mechanisms, and enforcement—are the cornerstones of A4R. This approach is the most ethically defensible because it focuses on a fair, transparent, and reasoned process for navigating the conflict.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Allocate the budget by lottery across all pending requests to avoid bias; if the gene therapy request randomly wins, fund it, otherwise fund the population bundle, since chance is the fairest method when resources are scarce.**\nA lottery is a mechanism of procedural justice, but it is typically reserved for situations where claimants are considered to have equal moral standing or when there are no relevant criteria to distinguish between them. This is not the case here. The two options have vastly different consequences in terms of cost-effectiveness and population benefit. Using a lottery would be an abdication of the responsibility to make a reasoned decision based on relevant ethical and clinical criteria, as demanded by the A4R framework. It treats an ethically complex decision as a matter of pure chance, ignoring substantive differences in outcomes.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Defer to parental autonomy; since the parents consent to the gene therapy, approve it regardless of budget constraints or population trade-offs, because surrogate decision-makers determine the infant’s best interests.**\nThis option incorrectly frames the issue as one of parental autonomy alone. While parents are the surrogate decision-makers for their child, their authority does not extend to an unconditional claim on limited public resources. In any system with resource constraints, the principle of justice must temper the principles of autonomy and beneficence. A decision to approve a treatment \"regardless of budget constraints\" is a logical impossibility in a system with a fixed budget. This option fails to acknowledge the central conflict of distributive justice posed by the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4873112"}]}
