It is not incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or ill-posed.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nLet $C_1$ be the event that the intended mother is a heterozygous carrier.\nLet $C_2$ be the event that the sperm donor is a heterozygous carrier.\nLet $A$ be the event that a single child conceived from their gametes is affected by the condition.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the posterior probabilities for the carrier events:\n$$P(C_1) = p_1$$\n$$P(C_2) = p_2$$\n\nThe problem describes an autosomal recessive condition. For a child to be affected, they must inherit one copy of the pathogenic allele from each genetic contributor. This is only possible if both the intended mother and the sperm donor are carriers. The probability of this outcome, given that both are indeed carriers, follows from Mendelian segregation and is provided as:\n$$P(A | C_1 \\cap C_2) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nIf at least one of the genetic contributors is not a carrier, the child cannot inherit two pathogenic alleles and thus cannot be affected. This can be expressed by stating that the probability of an affected child is $0$ if the event $C_1 \\cap C_2$ does not occur. Let $(C_1 \\cap C_2)^c$ represent the complement event (i.e., at least one individual is not a carrier). Then:\n$$P(A | (C_1 \\cap C_2)^c) = 0$$\n\nTo find the total probability of event $A$, denoted $P(A)$, we apply the law of total probability. We partition the sample space into two mutually exclusive and exhaustive events: $C_1 \\cap C_2$ (both are carriers) and $(C_1 \\cap C_2)^c$ (at least one is not a carrier).\nThe law of total probability states:\n$$P(A) = P(A | C_1 \\cap C_2) \\cdot P(C_1 \\cap C_2) + P(A | (C_1 \\cap C_2)^c) \\cdot P((C_1 \\cap C_2)^c)$$\n\nSubstituting the known conditional probabilities into this equation gives:\n$$P(A) = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\cdot P(C_1 \\cap C_2) + (0) \\cdot P((C_1 \\cap C_2)^c)$$\nThis expression simplifies to:\n$$P(A) = \\frac{1}{4} P(C_1 \\cap C_2)$$\n\nThe final step is to calculate $P(C_1 \\cap C_2)$, the probability that both individuals are carriers. The problem explicitly states that their carrier statuses are independent events. For independent events, the probability of their intersection is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(C_1 \\cap C_2) = P(C_1) \\cdot P(C_2)$$\n\nSubstituting the given probabilities $p_1$ and $p_2$:\n$$P(C_1 \\cap C_2) = p_1 p_2$$\n\nNow, we substitute this result back into the simplified expression for $P(A)$:\n$$P(A) = \\frac{1}{4} (p_1 p_2)$$\n\nThus, the posterior probability that a single child conceived from these gametes will be affected by the condition is $\\frac{p_1 p_2}{4}$.

The inclusion of the cohort size $N$ and the random placement assumption might initially suggest a complex hypergeometric calculation, but as will be shown, the final result for $\\mathbb{E}[X]$ is independent of $N$. This structure does not render the problem invalid; rather, it tests the solver's ability to correctly apply fundamental principles, such as linearity of expectation, and to discern which parameters are relevant to the quantity of interest.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of $\\mathbb{E}[X]$**\n\nWe are asked to find the expected number of unordered half-sibling pairs, $\\mathbb{E}[X]$, attributable to a single donor with $k$ offspring in a cohort of size $N$. We can solve this using two approaches.\n\n**Method 1: Direct Counting**\n\nThe random variable $X$ is defined as the total number of unordered half-sibling pairs from the specified donor.\nAccording to the problem statement, there are exactly $k$ individuals in the cohort who are offspring of this donor. By definition, any pair of these $k$ individuals forms a half-sibling pair. Assumption (ii) ensures that no other pairs in the cohort are half-siblings from this donor.\n\nTherefore, the number of such pairs is a deterministic quantity, determined by the number of ways to choose $2$ individuals from the group of $k$ offspring. This is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{k}{2}$.\n$$X = \\binom{k}{2} = \\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$$\nSince $X$ is a constant value for a given $k$, its expectation is simply the value itself.\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$$\nIn this direct interpretation, the information about the cohort of size $N$ and the random placement is extraneous to the calculation of the total number of existing pairs.\n\n**Method 2: Indicator Variables**\n\nThis method provides a more formal derivation that explicitly uses all the information given. Let the individuals in the cohort be indexed from $1$ to $N$. There are $\\binom{N}{2}$ distinct unordered pairs of individuals in the cohort.\n\nLet $I_{ij}$ be an indicator random variable for the event that the pair of individuals $\\{i, j\\}$ (with $1 \\le i < j \\le N$) is a half-sibling pair from the donor.\n$$I_{ij} = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if individuals } i \\text{ and } j \\text{ are half-siblings from the donor} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\nThe total number of half-sibling pairs, $X$, is the sum of these indicator variables over all possible pairs in the cohort.\n$$X = \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le N} I_{ij}$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected value of $X$ is the sum of the expected values of the indicator variables:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le N} I_{ij}\\right] = \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le N} \\mathbb{E}[I_{ij}]$$\nThe expectation of an indicator variable is the probability of the event it indicates.\n$$\\mathbb{E}[I_{ij}] = P(I_{ij}=1)$$\nThe event $I_{ij}=1$ occurs if and only if both individual $i$ and individual $j$ are part of the group of $k$ donor-conceived offspring. According to assumption (i), the $k$ offspring are chosen uniformly at random from the $N$ individuals.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose the set of $k$ offspring from the cohort of $N$ is $\\binom{N}{k}$.\nFor the event $I_{ij}=1$ to occur, both $i$ and $j$ must be in this set. The remaining $k-2$ offspring must be chosen from the remaining $N-2$ individuals in the cohort. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{N-2}{k-2}$.\n\nThe probability of this event is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:\n$$P(I_{ij}=1) = \\frac{\\binom{N-2}{k-2}}{\\binom{N}{k}}$$\nWe simplify this expression:\n$$P(I_{ij}=1) = \\frac{\\frac{(N-2)!}{(k-2)!(N-2-(k-2))!}}{\\frac{N!}{k!(N-k)!}} = \\frac{(N-2)!}{(k-2)!(N-k)!} \\cdot \\frac{k!(N-k)!}{N!} = \\frac{(N-2)! \\cdot k!}{N! \\cdot (k-2)!}$$\n$$P(I_{ij}=1) = \\frac{k(k-1)}{N(N-1)}$$\nSince this probability is the same for any pair $\\{i, j\\}$, we can substitute it back into the sum for $\\mathbb{E}[X]$. The sum has $\\binom{N}{2}$ identical terms.\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le N} \\frac{k(k-1)}{N(N-1)} = \\binom{N}{2} \\cdot \\frac{k(k-1)}{N(N-1)}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\binom{N}{2}$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\frac{N(N-1)}{2} \\cdot \\frac{k(k-1)}{N(N-1)}$$\nThe terms involving $N$ cancel out, yielding:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$$\nBoth methods produce the same result. The first result for Part 1 is $\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Multiplicative Change Factor $M$**\n\nThe multiplicative change factor $M$ is defined as the ratio of the expected number of pairs under the new policy (cap of $k/2$) to the expected number of pairs under the old policy (cap of $k$).\n$$M = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[X \\mid k/2]}{\\mathbb{E}[X \\mid k]}$$\nUsing the formula derived in Part 1, we can express the numerator and denominator.\nThe expected number of pairs with a cap of $k$ is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X \\mid k] = \\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$$\nTo find the expected number of pairs with a cap of $k/2$, we substitute $k/2$ for $k$ in our formula:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X \\mid k/2] = \\frac{(k/2)((k/2)-1)}{2} = \\frac{(k/2)(\\frac{k-2}{2})}{2} = \\frac{k(k-2)}{8}$$\nNow we compute the ratio $M$:\n$$M = \\frac{\\frac{k(k-2)}{8}}{\\frac{k(k-1)}{2}} = \\frac{k(k-2)}{8} \\cdot \\frac{2}{k(k-1)}$$\nAssuming $k \\geq 2$, $k \\neq 0$ and $k-1 \\neq 0$ (since $k \\geq 2$ implies $k-1 \\geq 1$). We can cancel the term $k$.\n$$M = \\frac{2(k-2)}{8(k-1)} = \\frac{k-2}{4(k-1)}$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the multiplicative change factor $M$.\n\nThe final answers are $\\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$ for $\\mathbb{E}[X]$ and $\\frac{k-2}{4(k-1)}$ for $M$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{k(k-1)}{2} & \\frac{k-2}{4(k-1)} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4862855"}, {"introduction": "Ultimately, gamete donation and surrogacy involve deeply personal and complex human situations that quantitative models alone cannot resolve.

The ethical principles cited are the canonical principles of bioethics established by Beauchamp and Childress. The methodology of casuistry is a standard and rigorous approach to resolving applied ethical problems.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined, presenting a conflict between duties and interests. It provides a specific methodology (casuistry), guiding principles, and analogical cases, which define a clear path toward a solution.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is presented in neutral, objective language, describing the positions and interests of all parties without bias.\n4.  **Completeness:** The problem contains all necessary information to perform the requested ethical analysis. The conflict itself—the clash between the donor's agreed-upon anonymity and the DCP's medical and psychological needs—is the core of the problem, not a sign of incompleteness.\n5.  **Flaw Checklist:** The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. It is not factually unsound, is highly relevant to medical ethics, is internally consistent, describes a realistic scenario, and requires substantive ethical reasoning.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n\n### **Step 2: Derivation of a Case-Sensitive Norm via Casuistry**\n\nThe casuistic method requires analyzing the index case in light of ethical principles and relevant paradigm cases (here, adoption and organ donation).\n\n1.  **Application of Ethical Principles:**\n    -   **Respect for Autonomy:** This principle is in direct conflict. The donor's autonomy was exercised in the past via an informed consent process that guaranteed anonymity. Violating this would be a serious breach of trust. The DCP's autonomy as an adult involves the right to know their genetic heritage to inform their identity and life decisions, including crucial medical ones. A just policy must respect both claims as much as possible.\n    -   **Nonmaleficence (Do No Harm):** Harm could befall the donor if their identity is revealed against their will, potentially disrupting their life and family. This also harms the integrity of the medical system by retroactively breaking promises. Harm could befall the DCP if information critical to their health (the heritable cardiac condition) or psychological well-being is withheld. The duty to prevent harm in a medical context is paramount, especially when the information can facilitate cascade screening.\n    -   **Beneficence (Do Good):** Beneficence points toward providing the DCP with information that could improve their health and psychological state. It also supports honoring the donor's wishes, thereby fostering a climate of trust that encourages future donation.\n    -   **Justice:** Justice requires a fair balancing of these competing interests. It also suggests that policies should evolve to reflect societal changes and correct for past oversights, such as the failure to anticipate the long-term needs of DCPs. A just solution for this \"retrospective\" case should also inform a more just \"prospective\" policy.\n\n2.  **Analogical Reasoning:**\n    -   **Analogy to Adoption:** The problem notes a \"shift toward openness.\" This precedent suggests that historical policies of absolute secrecy are increasingly seen as unjust to the person born from the arrangement. The psychological need for knowledge of one's origins is recognized as profound. This analogy argues strongly against a policy of absolute, unbreakable anonymity. However, adoption laws often still include mechanisms for birth parents to lodge a contact veto, so a simple mandate for disclosure is not a direct lesson.\n    -   **Analogy to Organ Donation:** The problem highlights \"mediated, mutual-consent contact.\" This precedent is powerful. It establishes a model where anonymity is the default but not an absolute barrier. It allows for contact if, and only if, both parties agree, with an intermediary organization managing the process. This model expertly balances the donor's right to privacy with the recipient's potential interest in contact, grounding any interaction in mutual, present-day consent.\n\n3.  **Synthesis and Norm Derivation:**\n    A casuistic resolution must be sensitive to the particulars of the case.\n    -   The promise of anonymity to the donor cannot be unilaterally and retroactively voided. This would violate autonomy and nonmaleficence.\n    -   The DCP's medical need is urgent and falls under the duty to prevent harm (nonmaleficence). The donor has already consented to provide medical updates, creating a clear pathway and duty for the clinic to facilitate this. This part is non-negotiable.\n    -   The DCP's psychological need is significant and endorsed by the adoption analogy's trend toward openness.\n    -   The organ donation analogy provides the ideal procedural mechanism to handle the request for identity: mediated outreach to seek current consent. This respects the autonomy of both parties. The donor can reconsider their earlier choice in light of the adult DCP's request, but they are not coerced. Their refusal must be honored, thereby upholding the original agreement.\n    -   A sophisticated policy would also consider a \"break-glass\" exception: if the heritable risk is so grave and immediate that identity disclosure is the only means to prevent death or serious harm (e.g., locating the donor for a direct medical consult is essential), a minimal, necessary disclosure might be warranted. This reflects the primacy of nonmaleficence in extreme circumstances.\n    -   Finally, justice and beneficence demand a better prospective policy. Future informed consent should explicitly address identity release, giving donors a clear choice and providing transparency for all future parties.\n\n    The derived norm is therefore a multi-tiered, mediated policy: it guarantees medical information, uses an intermediary to seek consent for identity disclosure while respecting the donor's final say, allows for narrow medical exceptions, and reforms the process for the future.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluation of Provided Options**\n\n-   **A. Mandate identity disclosure for all gamete donors to donor-conceived individuals upon reaching 18 years of age, retroactively and prospectively, treating gamete donation analogously to open adoption without exception.**\n    This policy is absolutist and not case-sensitive. By mandating retroactive disclosure, it completely disregards the donor's autonomy and the explicit promise of anonymity, violating the principle of nonmaleficence and the professional duty of confidentiality. It misapplies the adoption analogy by ignoring the nuances (like contact vetoes) and fails to incorporate the mutual-consent lesson from organ donation.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **B. Preserve absolute anonymity for all gamete donors indefinitely, allowing only non-identifying medical information to be transmitted through the clinic, matching organ donation’s anonymity practice without avenues for consented contact.**\n    This policy is also absolutist. It correctly prioritizes the initial promise but completely dismisses the DCP's autonomy and psychological needs. It ignores the \"shift toward openness\" in adoption. Crucially, it misrepresents the organ donation precedent by claiming there are no avenues for consented contact, which the problem statement itself refutes.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C. Adopt a tiered, mediated policy: guarantee non-identifying medical information and updates to donor-conceived individuals; offer intermediary outreach to donors to seek consent for identity disclosure or contact; if the donor declines, continue medical updates without identity disclosure; allow narrowly tailored exceptions for urgent, serious heritable risks that require minimal necessary disclosure to enable cascade screening; and prospectively require donors to choose and record identity-release or continued anonymity, with clear notice to recipients and future offspring.**\n    This policy aligns perfectly with the norm derived through casuistic analysis. It is tiered and case-sensitive. It balances the conflicting principles of autonomy by establishing a mediated, mutual-consent process. It prioritizes nonmaleficence by guaranteeing medical updates and allowing for narrow exceptions in grave circumstances. It promotes justice by proposing a reformed prospective policy based on improved informed consent. It correctly synthesizes the insights from both the adoption and organ donation precedents.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **D. Vest permanent authority in recipient parents to decide whether the donor’s identity may be released, regardless of the donor’s preferences or the donor-conceived individual’s later requests.**\n    This option improperly assigns authority. The primary ethical conflict is between the donor and the adult DCP. The recipient parents are not the principal agents whose autonomy is at stake in this specific conflict. This policy would violate the autonomy of both the donor and their adult offspring. It is not supported by the ethical principles or the precedents.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **E. Randomly assign donor-conceived individuals to identity-disclosure and non-disclosure groups to empirically assess psychological and medical outcomes, using results to set future policy.**\n    This describes a clinical trial methodology, not a casuistic ethical resolution for the case at hand. It would be profoundly unethical to subject individuals to forced disclosure or forced non-disclosure for research purposes, violating their autonomy and the principle of nonmaleficence. It fails to address the immediate ethical problem and proposes a method that is itself ethically impermissible in this context.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4862900"}]}
