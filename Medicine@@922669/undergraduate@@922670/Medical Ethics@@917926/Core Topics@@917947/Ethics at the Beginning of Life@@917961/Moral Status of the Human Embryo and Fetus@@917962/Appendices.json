The embryo is located in the fallopian tube and cannot survive to term; the pregnancy poses a substantial risk of tubal rupture and potentially life-threatening hemorrhage to the patient. Two clinically accepted interventions are proposed: salpingectomy (surgical removal of the affected segment of the fallopian tube) and Methotrexate (MTX), a folate antagonist that arrests trophoblastic proliferation and halts the ectopic pregnancy. Assume for purposes of analysis that the embryo or fetus has significant moral status. The clinician seeks to evaluate permissibility under the Doctrine of Double Effect (DDE), defined by the following core conditions: the act must be of a morally good or neutral type, the agent intends only the good effect and not the bad effect (though the bad effect may be foreseen), the bad effect is not the means to the good effect, and the good effect is proportionate to or outweighs the bad effect. Let the act be $A$, the intended good end be $G$ (prevent maternal injury or death by resolving the ectopic pathology), the bad effect be $B$ (embryo death), and the means by which $A$ achieves $G$ be $M$. Let $I(X)$ denote the agent’s intention with respect to outcome $X$, where $I(X)=1$ indicates intention to realize $X$ and $I(X)=0$ indicates no intention to realize $X$. The clinician models salpingectomy as $A_s$ with $M_s$ being removal of pathologically compromised tubal tissue; embryo death $B$ is foreseen. The clinician models Methotrexate as $A_m$ with $M_m$ being pharmacologic inhibition of rapidly dividing trophoblastic tissue that sustains the embryo; embryo death $B$ is foreseen. Using these definitions, and restricting your reasoning to these fundamental DDE criteria and well-established medical facts about ectopic pregnancy and Methotrexate’s mechanism of action, which option best captures whether salpingectomy versus Methotrexate have different moral statuses under DDE, and why, based strictly on the structure of intention and the means-end relation?\n\nA. Under DDE, salpingectomy can be permissible while Methotrexate is impermissible, because in salpingectomy $B$ is a foreseen side-effect not used as the means to $G$ ($B\\notin M_s$), whereas in Methotrexate $B$ is constitutive of the means to $G$ ($B\\in M_m$), so Methotrexate fails the “bad-effect-not-as-means” condition.\n\nB. Under DDE, both are morally equivalent because the physician aims at $G$ in both ($I(G)=1$ and $I(B)=0$), and as long as $G$ proportionately outweighs $B$, the specific means-end relation is irrelevant.\n\nC. Under DDE, Methotrexate is preferable because it reduces surgical risks; proportionality alone determines permissibility even if $B$ is used instrumentally to achieve $G$.\n\nD. Under DDE, both are impermissible because any foreseen embryo death violates the intention condition, regardless of whether $B$ is a means or a side-effect.\n\nE. Under DDE, both can be permissible provided the clinician verbally disavows intending $B$ ($I(B)=0$); the physical mechanism ($M_s$ versus $M_m$) does not affect the moral analysis if subjective intention is correct.", "solution": "The problem statement poses a question in medical ethics, requiring the application of the Doctrine of Double Effect (DDE) to two treatments for ectopic pregnancy: salpingectomy and Methotrexate (MTX). The problem is to be analyzed under the assumption that the embryo has significant moral status.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Scenario**: Tubal ectopic pregnancy, patient is hemodynamically stable.\n- **Prognosis**: The embryo is non-viable. The pregnancy poses a substantial risk of tubal rupture and life-threatening hemorrhage to the patient.\n- **Assumption**: The embryo or fetus has significant moral status.\n- **Ethical Framework**: The Doctrine of Double Effect (DDE).\n- **DDE Conditions**:\n    1. The act must be of a morally good or neutral type.\n    2. The agent intends only the good effect and not the bad effect (though the bad effect may be foreseen).\n    3. The bad effect is not the means to the good effect.\n    4. The good effect is proportionate to or outweighs the bad effect.\n- **Symbolic Definitions**:\n    - Act: $A$\n    - Intended good end: $G$ (prevent maternal injury or death by resolving the ectopic pathology)\n    - Bad effect: $B$ (embryo death)\n    - Means by which $A$ achieves $G$: $M$\n    - Intention: $I(X)=1$ indicates intention to realize $X$; $I(X)=0$ indicates no intention.\n- **Model for Salpingectomy ($A_s$)**:\n    - Act: $A_s$ (salpingectomy)\n    - Means: $M_s$ (removal of pathologically compromised tubal tissue)\n    - Foreseen outcome: $B$ (embryo death)\n- **Model for Methotrexate ($A_m$)**:\n    - Act: $A_m$ (MTX administration)\n    - Means: $M_m$ (pharmacologic inhibition of rapidly dividing trophoblastic tissue that sustains the embryo)\n    - Foreseen outcome: $B$ (embryo death)\n- **Question**: Based on the DDE criteria and the defined models, what is the difference in moral status between salpingectomy and Methotrexate, focusing on intention and the means-end relation?\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is valid.\n- It is **scientifically grounded**: The descriptions of ectopic pregnancy, salpingectomy, and the mechanism of action of Methotrexate as a folate antagonist targeting rapidly dividing trophoblastic cells are medically accurate.\n- It is **well-posed**: It provides a clear, self-contained scenario with a precisely defined ethical framework (DDE) and formalized variables. The question asks for a direct logical application of these rules to the given facts.\n- It is **objective**: The problem uses formal, unbiased language. The assumption of \"significant moral status\" for the embryo is a standard stipulative premise for conducting this type of ethical analysis and does not introduce subjectivity into the logical task itself. The problem is a classic case study in applied ethics and is free from the flaws listed in the validation criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed by applying the four conditions of the DDE to both salpingectomy ($A_s$) and Methotrexate administration ($A_m$). The core of the question requires focusing on the third condition: the means-end relationship.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nLet us analyze each procedure ($A_s$ and $A_m$) against the four conditions of the DDE.\n\n1.  **Nature of the Act**: Both salpingectomy ($A_s$) and Methotrexate administration ($A_m$) are standard medical interventions. As acts of treating a pathological condition, they can be considered morally neutral. This condition is met for both.\n\n2.  **Intention**: The problem stipulates that the clinician intends the good effect, $G$ (preventing maternal harm), and not the bad effect, $B$ (embryo death), which is merely foreseen. Thus, $I(G)=1$ and $I(B)=0$. This condition is assumed to be met for both procedures for the purpose of the analysis.\n\n3.  **Means-End Relation**: This condition states that the bad effect, $B$, cannot be the means, $M$, to the good effect, $G$. This requires a causal analysis of each procedure.\n\n    -   **Salpingectomy ($A_s$)**: The act is the surgical removal of a segment of the fallopian tube. The means, $M_s$, is defined as the \"removal of pathologically compromised tubal tissue.\" This act directly achieves the good end, $G$, by removing the structure that is at risk of rupturing. The death of the embryo, $B$, is a consequence of removing the tissue in which it is implanted and on which it depends for life. The death of the embryo is not the *mechanism* by which the threat of rupture is averted. The threat is averted by the removal of the distended tube itself. If one could, hypothetically, remove the embryo and place it elsewhere before removing the tube, the surgery's primary goal ($G$) would still be achieved. Therefore, the causal structure is such that embryo death ($B$) is a foreseen, tragic side-effect of the life-saving act, not the means to it. Formally, $B \\notin M_s$. Salpingectomy thus passes the third condition of the DDE.\n\n    -   **Methotrexate ($A_m$)**: The act is the administration of a drug. The means, $M_m$, is defined as the \"pharmacologic inhibition of rapidly dividing trophoblastic tissue that sustains the embryo.\" Methotrexate is a cytotoxin that directly targets and destroys the trophoblast, which is an integral part of the developing conceptus. By destroying the trophoblast, the drug ensures the death of the embryo; this cessation of the biological process of the pregnancy is precisely *how* the threat of tubal rupture is resolved. The good effect, $G$, is achieved *because* the embryo dies and the pregnancy ceases to grow. The embryo's death, $B$, is the essential link in the causal chain between the administration of the drug and the resolution of the maternal pathology. Formally, embryo death is constitutive of the means, thus $B \\in M_m$. Methotrexate thus fails the third condition of the DDE, as it uses a bad effect (the death of the embryo) as the means to the good effect.\n\n4.  **Proportionality**: The good effect, $G$ (saving the mother's life or preventing grave harm), must be proportionate to the bad effect, $B$ (death of an embryo with significant moral status). In cases where the mother's life is at stake, this condition is generally considered to be met. However, since MTX fails condition $3$, an evaluation of condition $4$ is moot for that procedure in a strict DDE analysis.\n\n**Conclusion**: Based on the strict application of the DDE, particularly the means-end test, salpingectomy is a morally permissible act, while Methotrexate is not. The two procedures have different moral statuses because of the different causal structures of the acts.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Under DDE, salpingectomy can be permissible while Methotrexate is impermissible, because in salpingectomy $B$ is a foreseen side-effect not used as the means to $G$ ($B\\notin M_s$), whereas in Methotrexate $B$ is constitutive of the means to $G$ ($B\\in M_m$), so Methotrexate fails the “bad-effect-not-as-means” condition.**\nThis option accurately reflects the derivation above. It correctly identifies the causal distinction between the two procedures according to the means-end condition of the DDE. It correctly states that in salpingectomy, embryo death ($B$) is not the means ($M_s$), while in the case of Methotrexate, embryo death ($B$) is integral to the means ($M_m$). This is a precise application of the framework provided in the problem.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Under DDE, both are morally equivalent because the physician aims at $G$ in both ($I(G)=1$ and $I(B)=0$), and as long as $G$ proportionately outweighs $B$, the specific means-end relation is irrelevant.**\nThis option is incorrect. It claims the means-end relation is irrelevant, which explicitly contradicts condition $3$ of the DDE. The DDE is not simply a consequentialist calculus of intentions and proportions; the structure of the act, particularly the relationship between means and ends, is a critical and non-negotiable component.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Under DDE, Methotrexate is preferable because it reduces surgical risks; proportionality alone determines permissibility even if $B$ is used instrumentally to achieve $G$.**\nThis option is incorrect. While comparing surgical risks is relevant to the proportionality condition (condition $4$), this option wrongly asserts that \"proportionality alone determines permissibility.\" The DDE requires all four conditions to be met. An act that fails the means-end test (condition $3$) is impermissible, regardless of how favorable its proportionality calculation might seem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Under DDE, both are impermissible because any foreseen embryo death violates the intention condition, regardless of whether $B$ is a means or a side-effect.**\nThis option is incorrect. It fundamentally misunderstands the DDE. A central feature of the doctrine is the distinction between what an agent *intends* and what an agent merely *foresees*. Condition $2$ explicitly allows for a bad effect to be foreseen so long as it is not intended. This option conflates foresight with intention, thereby rendering the DDE internally incoherent and unusable.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Under DDE, both can be permissible provided the clinician verbally disavows intending $B$ ($I(B)=0$); the physical mechanism ($M_s$ versus $M_m$) does not affect the moral analysis if subjective intention is correct.**\nThis option is incorrect. It suggests that a subjective declaration of intention is sufficient to satisfy the DDE. However, the means-end condition (condition $3$) is an objective test of the causal structure of the act itself. An agent cannot use a bad thing as a means to a good end and then simply declare that they did not intend the means. The physical mechanism of action is precisely what is being evaluated in the means-end test. Ignoring the objective structure of the act in favor of pure subjectivism is contrary to the entire purpose of the DDE.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4872403"}, {"introduction": "While principles like \"potentiality\" are foundational to debates on fetal moral status, an unexamined application can lead to counterintuitive or implausible obligations. This thought experiment [@problem_id:4872420] guides you through a classic critique of the potentiality argument, the \"procreation proliferation\" problem. You will learn to use a toolkit of other ethical concepts—such as respect for autonomy, justice, and the person-affecting restriction—to construct a more nuanced and defensible version of the principle.", "problem": "An advanced undergraduate ethics seminar is debating the “potentiality principle” about the moral status of embryos and fetuses. A common formulation is that if an entity has the potential to become a person under standard conditions, it thereby acquires some moral claim that should guide our actions. However, a critic worries that unqualified appeals to potentiality lead to “procreation proliferation,” the implausible conclusion that agents are obligated to create as many potential persons as possible.\n\nConsider a scientifically plausible fertility center with cryopreserved gametes sufficient to assemble $N = 10^{5}$ embryos. If implanted under standard medical care, each embryo has an independent live-birth probability of $p = 0.25$. A single gestation imposes bodily burdens on the gestating person and consumes clinical resources $C$ per pregnancy, and the center’s total annual resources are $R$.\n\nYour task is to select the option that both (i) constructs a counterexample showing how an unqualified potentiality principle yields implausible obligations to keep creating or gestating more potential persons, and (ii) articulates a coherent set of conditions grounded in widely accepted ethical first principles—respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, justice, “ought implies can,” the person-affecting restriction, and the procreative asymmetry (the stronger moral reason not to create lives below a minimally decent threshold compared with the weaker or absent duty to create additional happy lives)—under which the potentiality principle can guide moral consideration of embryos and fetuses without implying “procreation proliferation.”\n\nWhich option best satisfies both (i) and (ii)?\n\nA. Counterexample: The clinic acquires a machine that can assemble embryos from gametes at near-zero marginal cost; if potentiality decisively grounds obligations, the clinic must devote $R$ and solicit unlimited gestational participation to convert as many of the $N$ embryos as possible into persons, sidelining other patients and programs. Conditions to avoid proliferation: Restrict potentiality to generate defeasible, imperfect reasons only for already existing embryos or fetuses with a realistic developmental trajectory under standard care (no duty to create more candidates); adopt a person-affecting constraint (adding more merely possible persons does not strengthen obligations); enforce respect for autonomy (no duty to use another’s body without consent), non-maleficence and justice via proportionality and fair-share resource limits ($C$ cannot crowd out obligations to existing persons); “ought implies can” disallows obligations beyond $R$; and accept procreative asymmetry (a strong reason not to create lives below a threshold of decency but no duty to create additional happy lives).\n\nB. Counterexample: A donor proposes funding to scale up embryo production to $N = 10^{6}$ and staffing to increase implantation throughput; if potentiality grounds moral status, the center should maximize expected total welfare by creating as many persons as possible. Conditions to avoid proliferation: Evaluate actions by maximizing expected aggregate well-being across all possible future persons, so any increase in $N$ or $p$ strengthens the duty to procreate; autonomy and justice are secondary if aggregate welfare rises.\n\nC. Counterexample: The center stores $5{,}000$ abandoned embryos with $p \\ge 0.10$; if potentiality grounds equal moral standing with persons once survival to $12$ weeks is likely, the center must gestate or find gestational surrogates for all such embryos. Conditions to avoid proliferation: Assign strict person-level rights to embryos when $p \\ge 0.10$ and the developmental stage is past $12$ weeks, requiring gestation unless $C$ is extreme; autonomy and resource constraints can be overridden when rights are at stake.\n\nD. Counterexample: Infertile couples can generate $n$ embryos each cycle; if potentiality is weighty, they must never discard embryos and should iteratively create more to increase the chance of a live birth. Conditions to avoid proliferation: Prohibit embryo destruction categorically but permit unlimited creation; rely on moral discomfort with disposal to check behavior instead of autonomy, person-affecting restrictions, or resource constraints; deny the procreative asymmetry as illusory.\n\nSelect one option only.", "solution": "### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem statement provides the following information and concepts for analysis:\n-   **Principle for debate**: The \"potentiality principle,\" formulated as: if an entity has the potential to become a person under standard conditions, it thereby acquires some moral claim that should guide our actions.\n-   **Objection to the principle**: Unqualified appeals to potentiality lead to \"procreation proliferation,\" an implausible obligation to create as many potential persons as possible.\n-   **Scenario Data**: A fertility center with:\n    -   Cryopreserved gametes sufficient to assemble $N = 10^5$ embryos.\n    -   Independent live-birth probability per embryo: $p = 0.25$.\n    -   Clinical resources consumed per pregnancy: $C$.\n    -   Total annual clinical resources: $R$.\n-   **Ethical First Principles for Grounding Conditions**:\n    1.

The procreative asymmetry\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem asks for the evaluation of ethical arguments within the context of medical ethics, a discipline closely related to biology and medicine.\n\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is grounded in established concepts in medical ethics (potentiality principle, procreative asymmetry, the four principles of biomedical ethics) and realistic biological/medical context (in-vitro fertilization, cryopreservation of gametes/embryos, implantation success rates). The values $N = 10^5$ and $p = 0.25$ are within plausible ranges for a large-scale fertility operation. The problem does not violate any scientific or mathematical principles.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for the identification of an option that successfully performs two distinct and clearly defined logical tasks: (i) constructing a specific type of counterexample (procreation proliferation), and (ii) formulating a resolution to that counterexample based on a provided set of coherent principles. This structure allows for a unique correct answer to be determined by logical and philosophical analysis.\n-   **Objectivity**: The language is objective and precise. It introduces established terminology from ethical theory (\"potentiality principle,\" \"person-affecting restriction\") without bias. It sets up a logical puzzle for evaluating arguments, not a subjective opinion poll.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-structured analytical task in applied ethics, a discipline related to the specified domain. The problem is logically coherent, grounded in established principles, and allows for an objective evaluation of the provided options. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe task is to identify the option that both (i) presents a valid counterexample demonstrating that an unqualified potentiality principle leads to \"procreation proliferation\" and (ii) articulates a coherent set of conditions, based on the provided ethical principles, to constrain the potentiality principle and avoid this outcome.\n\n**Option A Analysis**\n\n-   **(i) Counterexample**: This option posits a machine that makes embryo assembly nearly cost-free. It then correctly deduces that if potentiality *decisively* grounds obligations, the clinic would be obligated to expend all resources $R$ and solicit unlimited gestational carriers to actualize as many of the $N=10^5$ potential persons as possible. This would require sidelining other medical obligations. This is a clear and powerful illustration of \"procreation proliferation,\" an implausible moral conclusion derived from an unqualified version of the potentiality principle.\n-   **(ii) Conditions to avoid proliferation**: This option presents a comprehensive set of constraints.\n    -   It limits the principle's scope to *existing* embryos with a realistic chance, imposing no duty to *create* more. This directly targets the \"proliferation\" aspect.\n    -   It invokes the *person-affecting restriction*, which states that an action is only better or worse if it affects someone for the better or worse. Creating a new happy person doesn't make the world better in a way that generates an obligation, because there is no one who is made better off (the person did not exist beforehand to have their state improved). This directly counters total-utilitarian style reasoning that leads to proliferation.\n    -   It grounds constraints in *respect for autonomy* (no forced gestation), *non-maleficence* and *justice* (resource limits, $C$, must not harm existing people or deny them fair shares), and *“ought implies can”* (obligations are limited by total resources $R$).\n    -   It explicitly accepts the *procreative asymmetry* (no duty to create happy lives), which is a cornerstone principle for rejecting procreation proliferation.\n-   **Verdict**: This option successfully fulfills both required criteria. The counterexample is strong, and the conditions are coherent, well-grounded in the specified principles, and directly address the problem. **Correct**.\n\n**Option B Analysis**\n\n-   **(i) Counterexample**: It proposes a donor scaling up to $N=10^6$ embryos. It states that if potentiality is the basis, the center should maximize expected total welfare. This is a plausible, albeit utilitarian-flavored, version of the proliferation problem.\n-   **(ii) Conditions to avoid proliferation**: This part is critically flawed. It proposes to \"Evaluate actions by maximizing expected aggregate well-being across all possible future persons.\" This is not a condition to *avoid* proliferation; it is the very framework (total utilitarianism) that *generates* the proliferation obligation. It explicitly states that increases in $N$ or $p$ would *strengthen* the duty to procreate and that autonomy and justice are secondary. This option describes the problem, not the solution.\n-   **Verdict**: This option fails criterion (ii). **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C Analysis**\n\n-   **(i) Counterexample**: It considers $5,000$ abandoned embryos and posits that a strong potentiality principle (equal moral standing if $p \\ge 0.10$ and post-$12$ weeks) requires gestating all of them. This is a reasonable, though less expansive, example of the kind of implausible obligation at issue.\n-   **(ii) Conditions to avoid proliferation**: The proposed \"solution\" is to \"Assign strict person-level rights to embryos when $p \\ge 0.10$ and the developmental stage is past $12$ weeks.\" This is precisely the premise that generated the counterexample's problematic conclusion. It is not a set of moderating conditions; it is a restatement of the unqualified principle. It further suggests that autonomy and resource constraints can be *overridden*, which exacerbates the problem rather than solving it.\n-   **Verdict**: This option fails criterion (ii). It mistakes the problem for the solution. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D Analysis**\n\n-   **(i) Counterexample**: It suggests that infertile couples, if they believe potentiality is weighty, must never discard embryos and should create more to maximize chances of a live birth. This reflects the proliferation concern at the level of individual choice.\n-   **(ii) Conditions to avoid proliferation**: The proposed conditions are incoherent and contrary to the problem's requirements. It suggests prohibiting destruction while permitting unlimited creation, which *is* a form of proliferation. Crucially, it advocates relying on \"moral discomfort\" *instead of* the very principles (autonomy, person-affecting restrictions, resource constraints) that the prompt requires for a solution. It also explicitly suggests *denying* the procreative asymmetry, a key principle needed to solve the problem.\n-   **Verdict**: This option fails criterion (ii) because its proposed conditions are antithetical to a principled ethical resolution and reject the tools provided in the prompt. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly Option A provides both a cogent counterexample illustrating the \"procreation proliferation\" problem and a coherent, multi-faceted solution that is explicitly grounded in the widely accepted ethical principles listed in the problem statement.

The expression $\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)$ is known as the logit function, $\\text{logit}(p)$.\n$$-\\text{logit}(\\alpha) = -a(y)(B_c(y;\\alpha)-\\mu(y))$$\n$$\\text{logit}(\\alpha) = a(y)(B_c(y;\\alpha)-\\mu(y))$$\nFinally, we isolate $B_c(y;\\alpha)$:\n$$\\frac{\\text{logit}(\\alpha)}{a(y)} = B_c(y;\\alpha)-\\mu(y)$$\n$$B_c(y;\\alpha) = \\mu(y) + \\frac{\\text{logit}(\\alpha)}{a(y)}$$\nSubstituting the definition of the logit function, we obtain the final expression for the continuous boundary:\n$$B_c(y;\\alpha) = \\mu(y) + \\frac{1}{a(y)}\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha}\\right)$$\nThis result is intuitive: the viability boundary is the mean age $\\mu(y)$ (where survival is $50\\%$) shifted by an amount that depends on the chosen threshold $\\alpha$ and is scaled inversely by the steepness parameter $a(y)$.\n\n### Derivation of the Sensitivity, $S(y;\\alpha)$\n\nThe sensitivity, $S(y;\\alpha)$, is defined as the partial derivative of the viability boundary with respect to the threshold $\\alpha$. For the continuous boundary, this is:\n$$S(y;\\alpha) = \\frac{\\partial B_c(y;\\alpha)}{\\partial \\alpha}$$\nWe differentiate the expression for $B_c(y;\\alpha)$ with respect to $\\alpha$. The parameters $\\mu(y)$ and $a(y)$ are treated as constants during this differentiation.\n$$S(y;\\alpha) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha} \\left[ \\mu(y) + \\frac{1}{a(y)}\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha}\\right) \\right]$$\n$$S(y;\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{a(y)} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha} \\left[ \\ln(\\alpha) - \\ln(1-\\alpha) \\right]$$\nUsing the chain rule for derivatives of logarithmic functions:\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha} \\left[ \\ln(\\alpha) - \\ln(1-\\alpha) \\right] = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} - \\frac{-1}{1-\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} + \\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}$$\nCombining the terms gives:\n$$\\frac{1-\\alpha + \\alpha}{\\alpha(1-\\alpha)} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha(1-\\alpha)}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for sensitivity, we arrive at the final form:\n$$S(y;\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{a(y)\\,\\alpha(1-\\alpha)}$$\nThis expression shows that the sensitivity is highest near the tails of the distribution (i.e., as $\\alpha \\to 0$ or $\\alpha \\to 1$) and lowest at $\\alpha=0.5$. It is also inversely proportional to the steepness $a(y)$, meaning a faster transition from non-viability to viability leads to a boundary that is less sensitive to the exact choice of $\\alpha$.\n\n### Computational Procedure and Results\n\nFor each test case $(y, \\alpha)$, the following quantities are computed:\n1.  The time-dependent parameters $\\mu(y)$ and $a(y)$:\n    $$\\mu(y) = \\mu_0+m_\\mu\\,(y-y_0) = 26 - 0.04(y-2000)$$\n    $$a(y) = a_0+m_a\\,(y-y_0) = 1.1 + 0.008(y-2000)$$\n2.

The integer policy boundary $B_i(y;\\alpha) = \\lceil B_c(y;\\alpha) \\rceil$, which is an integer.\n4.
