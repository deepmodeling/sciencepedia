The team aims to adhere to the ethical principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence and to formalize the principle of proportionality in palliative care: an intervention is ethically permissible when the expected patient-centered benefit outweighs the expected patient-centered burden, given the patient’s values and goals. To operationalize this, both expected benefit and expected burden are quantified on a validated, normalized scale from $0$ to $1$, where higher values indicate greater magnitude on the relevant dimension.\n\nIn this case, the observed, patient-centered expected benefit is $B=0.7$ (derived from patient-reported improvement in breathlessness and alignment with stated goals), and the observed expected burden is $C=0.2$ (incorporating expected sedation, nausea, and caregiver logistical strain). The team’s policy is to use a proportionality index defined in terms of the relative magnitude of benefit to burden and to treat the intervention as ethically permissible if and only if this proportionality index meets or exceeds a threshold that encodes “benefit at least equals burden.” The decision threshold is $\\tau=1$.\n\nStarting from fundamental ethical definitions (beneficence, nonmaleficence, and proportionality understood as “benefit at least equals burden”) and a normalized scale for $B$ and $C$, derive the appropriate proportionality index in closed form and compute its value for $B=0.7$ and $C=0.2$.

The ethical framework is grounded in the principles of beneficence (promoting benefit) and nonmaleficence (avoiding harm), which are integrated into a principle of proportionality.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the given principles and definitions. The expected patient-centered benefit is denoted by $B$, and the expected patient-centered burden is denoted by $C$. Both $B$ and $C$ are quantified on a normalized scale from $0$ to $1$, i.e., $B, C \\in [0, 1]$. The problem states the observed values are $B = 0.7$ and $C = 0.2$.\n\nThe core of the problem is to derive a \"proportionality index,\" which is described as being defined \"in terms of the relative magnitude of benefit to burden.\" Let this index be denoted by $I$. The most direct and standard mathematical interpretation of the relative magnitude of a quantity $B$ with respect to another quantity $C$ is their ratio. Therefore, we define the proportionality index $I$ as:\n$$I = \\frac{B}{C}$$\nThis definition is contingent on $C \\neq 0$. In this problem, $C = 0.2$, so the index is well-defined.\n\nNext, we must verify if this definition is consistent with the decision rule provided. The policy states that an intervention is ethically permissible if and only if the index $I$ meets or exceeds a threshold $\\tau$, which is given as $\\tau = 1$. The threshold $\\tau=1$ is specified to encode the ethical condition \"benefit at least equals burden.\"\n\nLet's test our definition of $I$ against this condition. The decision rule is $I \\ge \\tau$. Substituting our expression for $I$ and the given value for $\\tau$:\n$$\\frac{B}{C} \\ge 1$$\nSince $C$ represents a burden, its value is non-negative. The given value is $C=0.2$, which is strictly positive. We can multiply both sides of the inequality by $C$ without changing the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$B \\ge C$$\nThis inequality, $B \\ge C$, is the precise mathematical statement corresponding to the qualitative phrase \"benefit at least equals burden.\" The perfect alignment between the consequence of our index definition ($B \\ge C$) and the problem's stated ethical principle confirms that $I = B/C$ is the correct closed-form expression for the proportionality index.\n\nNow, we are asked to compute the value of this index for the given data: $B=0.7$ and $C=0.2$. Substituting these values into our derived formula:\n$$I = \\frac{0.7}{0.2}$$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$I = 3.5$$\nThis is a dimensionless quantity, as it is a ratio of two values measured on the same normalized scale.\n\nFinally, we are asked to evaluate whether the intervention is ethically permissible under the team's rule. The rule is that the intervention is permissible if $I \\ge \\tau$. We have calculated $I=3.5$ and are given $\\tau=1$. We check the inequality:\n$$3.5 \\ge 1$$\nThis statement is true. Therefore, according to the formalized policy, the proposal to initiate low-dose opioid therapy is ethically permissible.\n\nThe problem requests the computed index as the final numeric answer. The computed value is $3.5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.5}$$", "id": "4875205"}, {"introduction": "Building on the idea of weighing benefits and harms, this next exercise introduces a widely used metric from health economics—the Quality-Adjusted Life Year ($QALY$).

The patient’s stated priorities across four domains are normalized on a unit interval scale with higher values denoting greater importance: pain relief priority $P=0.8$, preservation of function $F=0.6$, mental clarity $M=0.4$, and life prolongation $T=0.2$. An ethics committee has also specified normalized ethical weights for the corresponding domains to reflect shared professional norms: $\\alpha=0.4$ for pain relief (beneficence-focused), $\\beta=0.2$ for function (quality-of-life), $\\gamma=0.2$ for mental clarity (respect for autonomy), and $\\delta=0.2$ for life prolongation (sanctity-of-life). All weights are on $[0,1]$ and sum to $1$.\n\nAssume a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) framework grounded in Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT). Start from the following foundational base:\n- Under mutual preferential independence of the attributes, the overall value of an intervention can be represented as an additive aggregation of single-attribute value contributions.\n- Each attribute’s contribution should be proportional to both the ethically assigned weight for that attribute and the patient’s elicited priority for that attribute.\n- Each intervention’s performance on each attribute is represented by a normalized expected effect score on $[0,1]$, with $0$ denoting the worst and $1$ the best ethically relevant performance for that attribute.\n\nFor the two options, clinicians have estimated the following expected effect scores on the same $[0,1]$ scale:\n- For proportionate palliative sedation: expected pain relief $E_{P}(\\mathrm{Sed})=0.95$, expected function $E_{F}(\\mathrm{Sed})=0.05$, expected mental clarity $E_{M}(\\mathrm{Sed})=0.05$, expected life prolongation $E_{T}(\\mathrm{Sed})=0.5$.\n- For continued optimized low-dose opioids: expected pain relief $E_{P}(\\mathrm{Op})=0.6$, expected function $E_{F}(\\mathrm{Op})=0.7$, expected mental clarity $E_{M}(\\mathrm{Op})=0.8$, expected life prolongation $E_{T}(\\mathrm{Op})=0.7$.\n\nUsing only the principles stated above, first construct an ethically justified additive value function that combines attribute-level effects with both the ethical weights and the patient’s priorities.

Furthermore, each attribute's contribution should be proportional to both its ethical weight ($w_i^{\\mathrm{eth}}$) and the patient's priority for it ($p_i^{\\mathrm{pat}}$). The most direct way to model this is to create a composite weight for each attribute, $W_i$, by multiplying the ethical weight and the patient priority.
