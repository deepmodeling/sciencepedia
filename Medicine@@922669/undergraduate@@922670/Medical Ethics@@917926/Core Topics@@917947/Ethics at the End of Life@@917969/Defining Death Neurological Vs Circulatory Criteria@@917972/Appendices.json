Reversibility is undermined if confounders are present: central nervous system depressants can reduce arousal and suppress brainstem reflexes, neuromuscular blockers can abolish motor responses and spontaneous respirations, and hypothermia both depresses neurological function and slows clearance of drugs. To ensure that any observed absence of function is not pharmacologically induced, a conservative operationalization is to wait until the plasma concentration $C(t)$ for each confounding agent has decayed to a small fraction $f^{\\ast}$ of its value at discontinuation $C(0)$.\n\nWe begin from first principles of first-order elimination and temperature dependence:\n1. First-order elimination satisfies the differential equation $\\frac{dC}{dt}=-k\\,C$, where $k$ is the elimination rate constant. The solution is $C(t)=C(0)\\,\\exp(-k\\,t)$.\n2.

This supports the ethical requirement to either rewarm to normothermia or extend withholding intervals to maintain the integrity of a neurological determination of death.
