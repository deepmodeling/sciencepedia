Over the following months, the patient reports feeling more outgoing, assertive, and inclined to take social and financial risks. Close family members are unsettled, describing the patient as impulsive and unlike her prior self. The patient alternates between two stances depending on context. In structured, unhurried clinical interviews conducted during stimulation and during short voluntary pauses in stimulation, she states that the newfound assertiveness aligns with values she long held but felt unable to enact due to depression, and she offers reasons for why these traits fit her aspirations and plans. In contrast, during episodes of high arousal that occur with certain stimulation settings, she spends money imprudently and later says those specific behaviors felt alien to her intentions. Neuropsychological testing suggests preserved decisional capacity and intact appreciation of risks and benefits in the structured setting. The clinical team can adjust stimulation to minimize the high-arousal episodes while retaining some motivational effects. The question is whether, and under what conditions, these personality changes undermine the patient’s narrative selfhood and authenticity.\n\nStarting from core concepts in medical ethics and neuroethics, including the idea that personal identity over time is supported by the capacity to construct a coherent life story that integrates significant changes, that authenticity concerns whether first-order motivations accord with reflectively endorsed higher-order values, and that autonomy requires decisional capacity and reasons-responsiveness free of coercion, choose the best evaluation below.

In structured, unhurried clinical interviews (during stimulation and voluntary pauses), she endorses the new assertiveness, stating it aligns with long-held but previously unexpressed values and fits her aspirations.\n    2.  During high-arousal episodes with certain stimulation settings, she engages in imprudent spending and later describes these specific behaviors as \"alien to her intentions.\"\n*   **Clinical Data:** Neuropsychological testing confirms preserved decisional capacity and intact appreciation of risks and benefits in structured settings.\n*   **Technical Capability:** The clinical team can adjust stimulation to minimize high-arousal episodes while retaining some motivational benefits.\n*   **Central Question:** Under what conditions do these personality changes undermine the patient's narrative selfhood and authenticity?\n*   **Guiding Ethical Principles:**\n    1.  **Narrative Selfhood:** Personal identity over time is supported by the capacity to construct a coherent life story that integrates significant changes.\n    2.  **Authenticity:** Concerns whether first-order motivations accord with reflectively endorsed higher-order values.\n    3.  **Autonomy:** Requires decisional capacity and reasons-responsiveness free of coercion.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem is a hypothetical case study designed to test the application of ethical principles.\n*   **Scientifically Grounded:** The scenario is grounded in established neuroscience and clinical practice. DBS is a real therapy, and personality changes, impulsivity, and effects on motivation are known and studied outcomes, particularly when targeting reward circuits. The ethical dilemma presented is a central topic in contemporary neuroethics. The premises are scientifically plausible.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a detailed set of facts and a clearly defined set of ethical principles. The question asks for an evaluation based on these principles, which allows for a single best answer to be reasoned among the options.\n*   **Objective:** The case is described using objective, clinical language, presenting the patient's perspective, the family's perspective, and clinical findings without introducing bias.\n*   **Completeness:** The problem is self-contained. It provides all the necessary information—the patient's history, the effects of the intervention, the patient's conflicting reports, and the specific ethical frameworks to be used—to answer the question. The ambiguity in the patient's experience is the core of the problem, not a flaw in its specification.\n*   **Other Flaws:** The problem does not violate any other criteria. It is not based on misconceptions, is not-trivial, and is structured for logical analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It presents a scientifically plausible and ethically complex scenario that is well-posed for rigorous analysis using the provided principles. Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe ethical analysis hinges on applying the provided definitions of narrative selfhood and authenticity to the patient's complex and context-dependent experiences.\n\n*   **Narrative Selfhood:** This concept emphasizes the ability to integrate changes into a coherent life story. The patient, in her reflective moments, actively performs this integration. She frames her newfound assertiveness not as a radical break, but as the realization of long-held values previously suppressed by depression. This act of re-narrating her identity to include the changes supports the idea that narrative selfhood is being maintained, at least for a subset of the changes. However, her description of imprudent spending as \"alien\" suggests these specific acts are dissonant with her narrative and are difficult to integrate.\n\n*   **Authenticity:** This concept compares first-order motivations (impulses) with higher-order values (reflective endorsements).\n    *   The general trait of assertiveness is experienced as authentic. The patient's first-order inclination to be more outgoing is aligned with her reflectively endorsed higher-order value of being the person she always \"felt unable to enact.\"\n    *   The specific acts of imprudent spending during high-arousal states are experienced as inauthentic. The first-order motivation to spend is \"alien to her intentions,\" meaning it conflicts with her higher-order, reflective judgment about how she wishes to act.\n\n*   **Autonomy:** Her preserved decisional capacity in structured settings supports her autonomy in endorsing the general personality shift. The compulsive, \"alien\" nature of certain behaviors suggests a localized compromise of autonomy during high-arousal states.\n\nA correct ethical evaluation must account for this dichotomy: some changes are endorsed and integrated, while others are disavowed and experienced as alien. The conditions for this distinction are the patient's reflective state and a lack of ego-dystonic, compulsive experience.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Because the changes have an external technological cause, they necessarily undermine narrative selfhood and are inauthentic, regardless of the patient’s reflections or capacity, since genuine identity must be endogenous.**\nThis option proposes a \"naturalistic\" or \"origin-based\" standard for authenticity that is not supported by the provided principles. The principles of authenticity and narrative selfhood are explicitly defined in terms of the patient's internal psychological processes: reflective endorsement and a capacity for narrative integration. This option dismisses the patient's agency and reflective capacity, which are the cornerstones of the given ethical framework. Many accepted medical interventions (e.g., antidepressants, prosthetics) are external yet are judged by how they align with a patient's goals.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The changes need not undermine narrative selfhood if, with preserved decisional capacity and opportunities for reflection across stimulation states, the patient stably endorses the traits as consonant with her core values and can intelligibly integrate them into a coherent life story; they are alienating if they are experienced as intrusive, reasons-opaque, compulsive, and persistently disendorsed upon reflection across contexts, such as high-arousal episodes tied to specific settings.**\nThis option perfectly captures the nuances of the case and correctly applies the given ethical principles. It establishes that the ethical assessment is conditional. The first clause aligns with the patient's reflective endorsement of her newfound assertiveness, invoking narrative integration and alignment with core values (authenticity). The second clause correctly identifies the conditions under which a change is alienating, matching the patient's description of her \"alien\" impulses during high-arousal states as intrusive, compulsive, and disendorsed upon reflection. This option is the only one that properly handles the context-dependency of the patient's experience.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Authenticity is determined primarily by social validation; because family members judge the post-DBS personality as unlike the prior self, the changes are alienating even if the patient reflectively endorses them.**\nThis option incorrectly defines authenticity by external social consensus rather than the first-person criteria provided in the problem statement. The given definition of authenticity is about the relationship between an individual's own first-order and higher-order states. While the family's view is clinically and socially important, it does not supersede the patient's own reflective endorsement in determining authenticity according to the specified principles. This view would compromise patient autonomy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Authenticity requires exact restoration of the pre-illness baseline; any divergence from prior traits constitutes a failure of narrative selfhood, even if the patient prefers and endorses the new traits after deliberation.**\nThis option posits a static view of identity, which is directly contradicted by the provided definition of narrative selfhood as the capacity to *integrate significant changes*. Successful treatment for depression is expected to produce changes. The patient herself views her pre-illness self as constrained and the new traits as a positive development. Insisting on a return to a \"baseline\" that the patient herself devalues is ethically problematic and inconsistent with the dynamic nature of identity.\n**Verdict:Incorrect.**\n\n**E. As long as the brain’s biological substrate remains continuous, psychological shifts cannot undermine identity; thus, all DBS-induced changes are compatible with authenticity regardless of endorsement or experience.**\nThis option commits a form of biological reductionism, equating personal identity with the mere physical continuity of the brain. This crassly ignores the psychological phenomena that are at the core of the ethical principles provided—reflection, narrative, and the subjective experience of one's own motivations. The patient's own report of certain behaviors feeling \"alien\" is a direct refutation of the claim that all changes are compatible with her identity. This view renders the concepts of authenticity and narrative selfhood meaningless.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4873525"}, {"introduction": "The ethical implications of a diagnostic test are not fixed; they depend critically on the context in which the test is used.

Assume the disease prevalence in an asymptomatic screening cohort is $0.02$, and in a memory-clinic diagnostic cohort is $0.40$. Using foundational definitions of test characteristics and the relationship between pre-test probability and post-test probability, first determine the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) for each context. Then, taking into account ethical principles of beneficence, nonmaleficence, respect for autonomy, and justice, select the option that most accurately defines sensitivity, specificity, $PPV$, and $NPV$ for a neuroimaging biomarker and correctly differentiates their ethical relevance in screening versus diagnosis contexts.\n\nChoose the single best option:\n\nA. Sensitivity is $P(\\text{test positive} \\mid \\text{disease})$, specificity is $P(\\text{test negative} \\mid \\text{no disease})$, $PPV$ is $P(\\text{disease} \\mid \\text{test positive})$, and $NPV$ is $P(\\text{no disease} \\mid \\text{test negative})$. $PPV$ and $NPV$ depend on disease prevalence through pre-test probability.

Population screening of asymptomatic adults (Screening Cohort).\n    2. Diagnostic use in symptomatic patients (Diagnostic Cohort).\n- Biomarker analytical performance:\n    - Sensitivity: $0.90$\n    - Specificity: $0.85$\n- Disease prevalence:\n    - Screening Cohort (asymptomatic): $0.02$\n    - Diagnostic Cohort (symptomatic): $0.40$\n- The task is to determine the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) for each context and then select the option that correctly defines these terms and evaluates their ethical relevance in screening versus diagnosis.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the validation criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on fundamental principles of biostatistics (sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, PPV, NPV) and medical ethics (beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy, justice). The scenario is realistic and represents a common challenge in medical diagnostics and public health. The numerical values are plausible.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data (sensitivity, specificity, and two distinct prevalence values) to calculate the PPV and NPV in both scenarios. The question is unambiguous and asks for calculations followed by an analysis based on established statistical and ethical frameworks.\n- **Objective**: The language is clear, precise, and objective, describing a standard clinical-statistical scenario without subjective bias.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the defined flaws (e.g., scientific unsoundness, missing information, unrealistic conditions). Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of PPV and NPV\n\nFirst, we define the key terms in probabilistic notation. Let $D$ be the event that a person has the disease, and $D^c$ (or $N$) be the event that a person does not have the disease. Let $T^+$ be a positive test result and $T^-$ be a negative test result.\n\n- **Sensitivity** (true positive rate): $P(T^+|D)$. Given as $0.90$.\n- **Specificity** (true negative rate): $P(T^-|D^c)$. Given as $0.85$.\n- **Prevalence**: $P(D)$. This is the pre-test probability of disease.\n- **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**: $P(D|T^+)$. This is the post-test probability of disease given a positive result.\n- **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**: $P(D^c|T^-)$. This is the post-test probability of not having the disease given a negative result.\n\nThe PPV and NPV can be calculated using Bayes' theorem.\n\nThe formula for PPV is:\n$$PPV = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D)P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nwhere $P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)$.\nSince $P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - \\text{Specificity}$, the formula becomes:\n$$PPV = \\frac{(\\text{Sensitivity}) \\times (\\text{Prevalence})}{(\\text{Sensitivity} \\times \\text{Prevalence}) + ((1 - \\text{Specificity}) \\times (1 - \\text{Prevalence}))}$$\n\nThe formula for NPV is:\n$$NPV = P(D^c|T^-) = \\frac{P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nwhere $P(T^-) = P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c) + P(T^-|D)P(D)$.\nSince $P(T^-|D) = 1 - P(T^+|D) = 1 - \\text{Sensitivity}$, the formula becomes:\n$$NPV = \\frac{(\\text{Specificity}) \\times (1 - \\text{Prevalence})}{(\\text{Specificity} \\times (1 - \\text{Prevalence})) + ((1 - \\text{Sensitivity}) \\times \\text{Prevalence})}$$\n\n**Case 1: Screening Cohort (Prevalence = $0.02$)**\n- Prevalence $P(D) = 0.02$, so $1 - P(D) = 0.98$.\n- Sensitivity = $0.90$.\n- Specificity = $0.85$, so $1 - \\text{Specificity} = 0.15$.\n- $1 - \\text{Sensitivity} = 0.10$.\n\n$$PPV_{\\text{screen}} = \\frac{0.90 \\times 0.02}{(0.90 \\times 0.02) + (0.15 \\times 0.98)} = \\frac{0.018}{0.018 + 0.147} = \\frac{0.018}{0.165} \\approx 0.1091$$\nThe PPV is approximately $10.9\\%$. This means that for every $100$ positive tests in this asymptomatic population, only about $11$ people actually have the preclinical disease.\n\n$$NPV_{\\text{screen}} = \\frac{0.85 \\times 0.98}{(0.85 \\times 0.98) + (0.10 \\times 0.02)} = \\frac{0.833}{0.833 + 0.002} = \\frac{0.833}{0.835} \\approx 0.9976$$\nThe NPV is approximately $99.8\\%$. This means a negative test is highly reassuring.\n\n**Case 2: Diagnostic Cohort (Prevalence = $0.40$)**\n- Prevalence $P(D) = 0.40$, so $1 - P(D) = 0.60$.\n- Sensitivity = $0.90$.\n- Specificity = $0.85$, so $1 - \\text{Specificity} = 0.15$.\n- $1 - \\text{Sensitivity} = 0.10$.\n\n$$PPV_{\\text{diag}} = \\frac{0.90 \\times 0.40}{(0.90 \\times 0.40) + (0.15 \\times 0.60)} = \\frac{0.36}{0.36 + 0.09} = \\frac{0.36}{0.45} = 0.80$$\nThe PPV is $80\\%$. A positive test in this symptomatic population now carries a high probability of being a true positive.\n\n$$NPV_{\\text{diag}} = \\frac{0.85 \\times 0.60}{(0.85 \\times 0.60) + (0.10 \\times 0.40)} = \\frac{0.51}{0.51 + 0.04} = \\frac{0.51}{0.55} \\approx 0.9273$$\nThe NPV is approximately $92.7\\%$. A negative test is still quite reassuring but less so than in the screening context.\n\n### Step 4: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Sensitivity is $P(\\text{test positive} \\mid \\text{disease})$, specificity is $P(\\text{test negative} \\mid \\text{no disease})$, $PPV$ is $P(\\text{disease} \\mid \\text{test positive})$, and $NPV$ is $P(\\text{no disease} \\mid \\text{test negative})$. $PPV$ and $NPV$ depend on disease prevalence through pre-test probability. In screening (low prevalence), high sensitivity and strong $NPV$ are ethically prioritized to reduce false negatives, while low $PPV$ and resulting false positives necessitate robust informed consent, staged confirmation, and attention to nonmaleficence and justice. In diagnosis (higher prevalence), $PPV$ rises and specificity becomes ethically critical to avoid harmful mislabeling and inappropriate treatment, balancing beneficence with nonmaleficence and respecting autonomy.**\n\n- **Definitions**: The definitions provided for sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV are all standard and correct.\n- **Prevalence Dependence**: The statement that PPV and NPV depend on prevalence is correct, as demonstrated by our calculations.\n- **Screening Analysis**: In the low-prevalence screening context, our calculated PPV was very low ($10.9\\%$), leading to a high rate of false positives. This makes informed consent and careful management of positive results (nonmaleficence, justice) essential. The NPV was very high ($99.8\\%$), which is the goal of a good screening test: to reliably rule out disease and avoid false negatives. This requires high sensitivity. This analysis is correct.\n- **Diagnostic Analysis**: In the high-prevalence diagnostic context, our calculated PPV rose significantly to $80\\%$. Here, confirming the disease is the primary goal. A false positive could lead to incorrect, harmful treatment. Therefore, the ability of the test to correctly identify those *without* the disease (specificity) becomes crucial to minimize these false positives and ensure the high PPV is meaningful. This correctly balances beneficence (correct diagnosis and treatment) with nonmaleficence (avoiding harm from misdiagnosis) and respects autonomy by providing accurate information for decision-making. This analysis is correct.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Sensitivity is $P(\\text{disease} \\mid \\text{test positive})$ and specificity is $P(\\text{no disease} \\mid \\text{test negative})$; $PPV$ and $NPV$ are intrinsic to the test and do not vary with prevalence. Screening ethically prioritizes specificity to minimize false positives, because false negatives are rare irrespective of prevalence.**\n\n- **Definitions**: The option incorrectly defines sensitivity as $P(D|T^+)$ (which is PPV) and specificity as $P(D^c|T^-)$ (which is NPV).\n- **Prevalence Dependence**: The claim that PPV and NPV are intrinsic properties that do not vary with prevalence is false. Sensitivity and specificity are the intrinsic properties.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Sensitivity is $P(\\text{test positive} \\mid \\text{disease})$, specificity is $P(\\text{test negative} \\mid \\text{no disease})$, but $PPV$ equals $\\dfrac{\\text{true positives}}{\\text{true positives} + \\text{true negatives}}$ and is maximized in low-prevalence screening; therefore screening should ethically prioritize $PPV$, while diagnostic contexts should focus on $NPV$.**\n\n- **PPV formula**: The formula for PPV is given as $\\dfrac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{True Positives} + \\text{True Negatives}}$. This is incorrect. The correct denominator is the total number of positive tests, which is $\\text{True Positives} + \\text{False Positives}$.\n- **PPV and Prevalence**: The claim that PPV is \"maximized in low-prevalence screening\" is false. Our calculations show the opposite: $PPV_{\\text{screen}} \\approx 11\\%$ while $PPV_{\\text{diag}} = 80\\%$.\n- **Ethical Priorities**: The recommendation to prioritize PPV in screening and NPV in diagnosis is the reverse of the standard and logical approach.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Sensitivity is $P(\\text{test positive} \\mid \\text{disease})$, specificity is $P(\\text{test negative} \\mid \\text{no disease})$, and, by Bayes’ theorem, sensitivity and specificity vary mainly with prevalence, whereas $PPV$ and $NPV$ are fixed properties of the biomarker. Hence, screening ethics should rely on stable $PPV$ and $NPV$, and diagnosis should adjust sensitivity and specificity to prevalence.**\n\n- **Prevalence Dependence**: This statement incorrectly claims that sensitivity and specificity vary with prevalence, while PPV and NPV are fixed. This is the exact opposite of the truth. Sensitivity and specificity are intrinsic performance characteristics of the biomarker itself, independent of the population in which it is used. PPV and NPV are profoundly dependent on the prevalence of the disease in the tested population.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4873547"}, {"introduction": "Deciding whether to adopt a new, expensive neurotechnology involves more than just assessing its effectiveness for an individual patient; it requires a comprehensive analysis of societal costs and benefits.

All necessary parameters and probabilities are provided, and they are internally consistent (e.g., the probabilities of the four outcomes sum to $0.40 + 0.30 + 0.20 + 0.10 = 1.00$). The objective is clearly stated: derive a specific threshold $c^{\\ast}$ and compute its value. A unique solution exists and can be derived from the provided data.\n- **Objective:** The language is precise and quantitative. It avoids subjective or biased statements. All components of the model are explicitly defined.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed for invalidation. It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete problem statement.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe ethical justification for adopting the new technology is assessed within a utilitarian social welfare framework. This framework posits that an action is justified if it produces a non-negative change in total social value. We define the incremental net social value per patient, $V$, as the sum of all monetized benefits minus the sum of all monetized costs, relative to the current standard of care.\n\nThe components of $V$ are:\n$1$. The expected incremental patient well-being, monetized using the willingness-to-pay parameter $\\lambda$.\n$2$. The expected value of societal externalities tied to patient outcomes.\n$3$. The net value of other externalities independent of patient outcomes.\n$4$. The incremental cost of the technology, $c$.\n\nThe decision rule is to adopt the technology if and only if $V \\geq 0$.\n\nThe expected incremental QALY gain per patient, $E[\\Delta Q]$, is the sum of the QALY changes for each outcome, weighted by their respective probabilities:\n$$E[\\Delta Q] = p_R \\Delta Q_R + p_{PR} \\Delta Q_{PR} + p_{NR} \\Delta Q_{NR} + p_{SAE} \\Delta Q_{SAE}$$\nThe monetized value of this expected QALY gain is $\\lambda E[\\Delta Q]$.\n\nThe expected value of outcome-dependent societal externalities, $E[E]$, is similarly calculated:\n$$E[E] = p_R E_R + p_{PR} E_{PR} + p_{NR} E_{NR} + p_{SAE} E_{SAE}$$\n\nThe net value of outcome-independent externalities, $V_{other}$, accounts for the research benefit, the equity penalty, and the expected loss from a privacy breach. The expected loss from the privacy breach is the probability of the breach multiplied by the loss if it occurs, $p_B L_B$.\n$$V_{other} = B_{res} - C_{eq} - p_B L_B$$\n\nThe total incremental net social value per patient, $V$, is the sum of these components, less the per-patient cost $c$:\n$$V = \\lambda E[\\Delta Q] + E[E] + V_{other} - c$$\n\nThe technology is ethically justifiable if $V \\geq 0$, which means:\n$$\\lambda E[\\Delta Q] + E[E] + V_{other} - c \\geq 0$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$c \\leq \\lambda E[\\Delta Q] + E[E] + V_{other}$$\nThe maximum ethically justifiable incremental per-patient cost, $c^{\\ast}$, is the threshold at which the net social value is zero. Therefore, the decision rule is to adopt if $c \\leq c^{\\ast}$, where:\n$$c^{\\ast} = \\lambda (p_R \\Delta Q_R + p_{PR} \\Delta Q_{PR} + p_{NR} \\Delta Q_{NR} + p_{SAE} \\Delta Q_{SAE}) + (p_R E_R + p_{PR} E_{PR} + p_{NR} E_{NR} + p_{SAE} E_{SAE}) + (B_{res} - C_{eq} - p_B L_B)$$\nThis expression is the principled decision rule required by the problem.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $c^{\\ast}$ using the provided data.\n\nFirst, calculate the expected incremental QALY gain, $E[\\Delta Q]$:\n$$E[\\Delta Q] = (0.40)(1.4) + (0.30)(0.7) + (0.20)(0) + (0.10)(-0.5)$$\n$$E[\\Delta Q] = 0.56 + 0.21 + 0 - 0.05 = 0.72 \\text{ QALYs}$$\nThe monetized value of this gain is:\n$$\\lambda E[\\Delta Q] = 120,000 \\frac{\\text{dollars}}{\\text{QALY}} \\times 0.72 \\text{ QALYs} = 86,400 \\text{ dollars}$$\n\nNext, calculate the expected value of outcome-dependent externalities, $E[E]$:\n$$E[E] = (0.40)(25,000) + (0.30)(8,000) + (0.20)(0) + (0.10)(-15,000)$$\n$$E[E] = 10,000 + 2,400 + 0 - 1,500 = 10,900 \\text{ dollars}$$\n\nNext, calculate the net value of outcome-independent externalities, $V_{other}$:\n$$V_{other} = 5,000 - 7,500 - (0.03)(600,000)$$\n$$V_{other} = 5,000 - 7,500 - 18,000 = -20,500 \\text{ dollars}$$\n\nFinally, sum these components to find $c^{\\ast}$:\n$$c^{\\ast} = \\lambda E[\\Delta Q] + E[E] + V_{other}$$\n$$c^{\\ast} = 86,400 + 10,900 - 20,500$$\n$$c^{\\ast} = 97,300 - 20,500 = 76,800 \\text{ dollars}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer in thousands of dollars (k$), rounded to three significant figures.\n$$c^{\\ast} = \\frac{76,800}{1,000} \\text{ k\\$} = 76.8 \\text{ k\\$}$$\nThe value $76.8$ has three significant figures, so no further rounding is needed. The maximum ethically justifiable incremental per-patient cost is $76.8$ k$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{76.8}$$", "id": "4873519"}]}
