While these tools are powerful, an alert is merely a piece of evidence, not a conviction. This practice will guide you through a Bayesian analysis to determine the true probability that a flagged event is actual misuse, revealing a frequently misunderstood statistical principle with profound implications for ethical governance and procedural justice in the workplace. [@problem_id:4856793]", "problem": "A large academic medical center uses an Electronic Health Records (EHR) access log anomaly detector to identify potential misuse of patient records. The detector has sensitivity $0.9$ (the probability it flags a misuse when misuse is present) and specificity $0.95$ (the probability it does not flag when misuse is absent). Historical audits indicate a base rate of actual misuse of $0.002$ among all access events.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions of sensitivity and specificity as conditional probabilities, along with the base rate as a prior probability, and using Bayes' theorem, derive the posterior probability that an access alert corresponds to actual misuse. Evaluate this probability for the given parameters of sensitivity $0.9$, specificity $0.95$, and base rate $0.002$. Express your final numerical answer as a decimal and round to four significant figures.\n\nThen, explain how the computed posterior probability should inform ethically justifiable sanctions and governance in the EHR context, referencing core medical ethics principles such as nonmaleficence, justice, and respect for persons. Your explanation should be based on first principles and the quantitative result you derived.

The sensitivity is the conditional probability $P(+ \\mid M)$ and the specificity is the conditional probability $P(- \\mid \\neg M)$, where $\\neg M$ denotes the complement event of no misuse.\n\nWe are given:\n- Sensitivity $P(+ \\mid M) = 0.9$.\n- Specificity $P(- \\mid \\neg M) = 0.95$, hence the false positive rate is $P(+ \\mid \\neg M) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n- Base rate (prior) $P(M) = 0.002$, hence $P(\\neg M) = 1 - 0.002 = 0.998$.\n\nBy Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability that an alert corresponds to actual misuse, which is the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), is\n$$\nP(M \\mid +) = \\frac{P(+ \\mid M)\\,P(M)}{P(+ \\mid M)\\,P(M) + P(+ \\mid \\neg M)\\,P(\\neg M)}.\n$$\n\nSubstitute the given values symbolically:\n$$\nP(M \\mid +) = \\frac{(0.9)(0.002)}{(0.9)(0.002) + (0.05)(0.998)}.\n$$\nCompute the numerator:\n$$\n(0.9)(0.002) = 0.0018.\n$$\nCompute the denominator components:\n$$\n(0.05)(0.998) = 0.0499,\n$$\nso the denominator is\n$$\n0.0018 + 0.0499 = 0.0517.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nP(M \\mid +) = \\frac{0.0018}{0.0517} = \\frac{18}{517} \\approx 0.034818.\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures and expressed as a decimal, this is $0.03482$.\n\nEthical implications grounded in first principles:\n- Nonmaleficence (avoid harm): With $P(M \\mid +) \\approx 0.03482$, the probability that a flagged alert reflects actual misuse is low. The false discovery rate is $1 - 0.03482 \\approx 0.96518$, and the ratio of false to true positives is $\\frac{1 - P(M \\mid +)}{P(M \\mid +)} = \\frac{499}{18} \\approx 27.7$. Sanctioning individuals solely on a single alert risks substantial harm to many innocent users, violating nonmaleficence.\n- Justice (fairness and proportionality): Given the low PPV, equitable governance requires proportionate responses to alerts. A single alert should trigger further inquiry (e.g., targeted audit, contextual review) rather than immediate punitive sanctions, to ensure fair treatment across staff.\n- Respect for persons (autonomy, dignity) and due process: The low PPV necessitates procedural safeguards—notice of the allegation, opportunity to explain contextual factors (e.g., on-call coverage, break-the-glass protocols), and independent review—before any punitive measures. This respects professional dignity and minimizes unjust stigma.\n- Accountability and stewardship: The quantitative evidence supports graded interventions (education, system prompts, access justifications) and corroboration with additional evidence (e.g., pattern analysis, supervisor verification) to ensure that sanctions are imposed only when the posterior probability is substantively increased by converging indicators.\n\nThus, the computed posterior probability supports policies that eschew immediate punitive sanctions based solely on a single anomaly alert and instead endorse layered investigative and corrective processes aligned with core medical ethics principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.03482}$$", "id": "4856793"}, {"introduction": "A lost laptop or a hacked server can trigger a cascade of legal and ethical obligations.

Protected Health Information (PHI) is defined under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) as individually identifiable health information. Under the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule in Title $45$ of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part $164$, a “breach” is the unauthorized acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of PHI that compromises the security or privacy of the PHI. The Rule presumes a breach unless the entity demonstrates a low probability that the PHI has been compromised, based on a risk assessment. HIPAA provides an “encryption safe harbor” for PHI encrypted according to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines such that the PHI is rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals.\n\nThe clinic’s internal report documents the following facts, all corroborated by a third-party digital forensics firm:\n\n- The laptop’s full-disk encryption was disabled. A user password was required for interactive login. No multi-factor authentication was enabled.\n- An Electronic Health Record (EHR) sync cache for $8{,}400$ patients was stored within an application-managed container encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a $256$-bit key and an implementation validated to conform to relevant NIST guidelines.\n- A locally saved spreadsheet containing names, medical record numbers, dates of service, and diagnoses for $600$ patients was stored on the user’s Desktop and was not encrypted.\n- A local email client cache containing approximately $1{,}200$ messages included appointment reminders, lab results, and referral letters; the cache resided in the user profile and was not encrypted beyond routine application password protection.\n- Mobile Device Management (MDM) issued a remote wipe command at $48$ hours post-loss; logs indicate completion at $51$ hours.\n- Forensic analysis shows $5$ boot events after loss. Windows login attempts were unsuccessful. However, there is evidence of booting from a removable USB device, mounting the internal drive, listing directories under “C:\\Users\\Clinician\\Documents” and “C:\\Users\\Clinician\\Desktop,” and copying at least $3$ non-PHI image files to the USB.

The described technologies (AES-$256$, MDM, remote wipe, booting from USB) and regulatory concepts (Breach Notification Rule, Safe Harbor) are factual and correctly represented.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a detailed set of facts and a clear set of rules (the HIPAA principles) to apply. It asks for the most appropriate compliance action, which can be deduced through logical application of these rules to the facts. A determinate conclusion is possible.\n- **Objective:** The problem statement is factual and devoid of subjective or biased language. It presents a case study for analysis.\n\n**Flaw Checklist:**\n1.  **Scientific/Factual Unsoundness:** None.\n2.  **Non-Formalizable/Irrelevant:** None. The problem is formalizable within the HIPAA risk assessment framework and is directly relevant to health systems science.\n3.  **Incomplete/Contradictory:** None. The data is sufficient and self-consistent for performing the required analysis.\n4.  **Unrealistic/Infeasible:** None. The scenario is highly realistic.\n5.  **Ill-Posed/Poorly Structured:** None.\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound/Trivial:** None.

The conclusion is verifiable by referencing the cited regulations.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-constructed and factually sound case study. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solution from First Principles\n\nThe analysis must be conducted by applying the provided HIPAA principles to each distinct set of data on the lost laptop.\n\n**1. Analysis of the EHR Sync Cache (`$8{,}400$` individuals)**\n\n- **Principle:** The HIPAA \"Encryption Safe Harbor\" at $45$ CFR § $164.402$ defines \"unsecured protected health information\" as PHI that is not rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals. Encryption is a specified method for securing PHI.\n- **Application:** The EHR sync cache was \"encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a `$256$`-bit key and an implementation validated to conform to relevant NIST guidelines.\" This meets the standard for the Encryption Safe Harbor.\n- **Conclusion:** The PHI in the EHR cache is considered \"secured.\" The loss of this data does not constitute a \"breach\" as defined by the Breach Notification Rule. Therefore, no notification is required for these `$8{,}400$` individuals.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Unencrypted Spreadsheet and Email Cache**\n\n- **Principle:** The loss of a device containing *unsecured* PHI is presumed to be a breach. The covered entity must rebut this presumption by demonstrating a \"low probability that the PHI has been compromised\" through a risk assessment.\n- **Application:** The spreadsheet and email cache were not encrypted to NIST standards. The disabled full-disk encryption and the bypass of the Windows login password (via USB boot) confirm the data was unsecured. Thus, the breach presumption applies. We must perform the four-factor risk assessment.\n\n**Risk Assessment for Unsecured PHI (approx. `$1{,}800$` individuals):**\n\ni.  **Nature and Extent of the PHI Involved:** The data includes names, MRNs, diagnoses, lab results, and referral letters. This is highly sensitive clinical information combined with direct identifiers, posing a significant risk of financial, reputational, and other harm to the individuals. The extent involves approximately `$1{,}800$` individuals.\n\nii. **The Unauthorized Person:** The identity of the person who found the laptop is unknown. However, the forensic evidence of booting from a USB drive, mounting the internal disk, and copying files demonstrates a level of technical sophistication beyond that of a casual user. They are not a trusted entity; an assumption of malicious intent or, at minimum, unauthorized curiosity is warranted.\n\niii. **Whether the PHI Was Actually Acquired or Viewed:** Forensic analysis confirms the unauthorized person had the capability and opportunity to access the files. They accessed the `Desktop` directory, where the spreadsheet was located. While there is no log of the file being opened, the breach presumption rule does not require definitive proof of access. The burden is on the covered entity to show a low probability of compromise. Given that the file system was mounted and browsed, it is not possible to demonstrate a low probability that the files were viewed or copied.\n\niv. **Extent to Which the Risk has been Mitigated:** The only mitigations were the Windows password, which was bypassed, and the remote wipe. The remote wipe at `$51$` hours occurred *after* forensic evidence shows the system was accessed. The data was exposed for up to `$51$` hours. The recovery of the device at `$72$` hours does not mitigate the risk of data copying during the exposure window. Mitigation was therefore unsuccessful in preventing a compromise.\n\n**Risk Assessment Conclusion:** The covered entity cannot demonstrate a low probability of compromise. The high sensitivity of the PHI, the technical capability of the unauthorized user, the direct evidence of access to the file system, and the failure of mitigation measures all lead to the conclusion that a reportable breach of unsecured PHI has occurred.\n\n**3. Determination of Notification Requirements**\n\n- **Individuals Affected:** The breach affects the individuals whose PHI was in the spreadsheet (`$600$`) and the email cache (related to `$1,200$` messages). The problem states this is approximately `$1{,}800$` individuals.\n- **Individual Notification:** Per $45$ CFR § $164.404$, the covered entity must notify each affected individual without unreasonable delay and no later than `$60$` calendar days after discovering the breach.\n- **HHS/OCR Notification:** Per $45$ CFR § $164.408$, if a breach affects `$500$` or more individuals, notice must be provided to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), via the Office for Civil Rights (OCR), without unreasonable delay and no later than `$60$` days. Since `$1{,}800  500$`, this notification is required.\n- **Media Notification:** Per $45$ CFR § $164.406$, if a breach affects more than `$500$` residents of a single State or jurisdiction, notice must be provided to prominent media outlets serving that State or jurisdiction. The problem states `$900$` affected individuals reside in the same jurisdiction. Since `$900  500$`, this notification is required.\n\n**Summary of Required Actions:**\nThe incident constitutes a reportable breach for approximately `$1{,}800$` individuals. The clinic must notify affected individuals, OCR, and the media. The clinic is not required to notify the `$8{,}400$` individuals whose data was secured by NIST-conformant encryption.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Conclude a low probability of compromise for all data because the laptop was recovered within $72$ hours and was password-protected; document the incident internally and do not notify individuals, the media, or the Office for Civil Rights (OCR).**\nThis option incorrectly assesses the risk. The password was not an effective control as it was bypassed. The recovery of the device does not eliminate the compromise that occurred when it was lost. The facts do not support a \"low probability of compromise\" for the unencrypted data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Treat the incident as a breach for only the spreadsheet ($600$ individuals), because email content is incidental and not PHI; notify those $600$ individuals within $60$ days and report to OCR, but no media notice is required.**\nThis option is flawed in three ways. First, email content containing lab results and other clinical information is PHI, not \"incidental.\" Second, by only counting `$600$` individuals, it undercounts the scope of the breach. Third, it incorrectly concludes media notice is not required, despite the problem stating `$900$` residents of one jurisdiction were affected, exceeding the `$500$` threshold.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Treat the incident as a reportable breach for PHI stored in the unencrypted spreadsheet and email cache (approximately $1{,}800$ individuals), notify affected individuals without unreasonable delay and within $60$ days, notify prominent media for the jurisdiction because $\\ge 500$ residents are affected, and report to OCR as required; do not notify for the $8{,}400$ EHR cache because it was encrypted to NIST standards and thus qualifies for safe harbor.**\nThis option accurately reflects the conclusions derived from first principles. It correctly identifies which data constitutes a breach (the unencrypted files) and which does not (the encrypted cache via Safe Harbor). It correctly calculates the scale of the breach and identifies all three required notification duties: to individuals, to the media, and to OCR.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Conclude there is no breach because forensic logs show no successful Windows logins; report the incident to OCR only as a security incident, with no individual or media notices.**\nThis option is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of computer security. Accessing a system does not require a native operating system login. The forensic evidence of booting from a USB device demonstrates unauthorized access to the unencrypted data on the storage medium, triggering the breach presumption.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Notify all $10{,}200$ potentially affected individuals (the $8{,}400$ EHR cache plus the $1{,}800$ unencrypted files), because any loss of a device containing PHI is automatically a breach regardless of encryption status; include media notice and OCR reporting.**\nThis option is incorrect because it ignores the Encryption Safe Harbor. The purpose of the safe harbor is to relieve covered entities of breach notification obligations when data has been properly secured. Notifying the `$8{,}400$` individuals is not required by HIPAA and represents a failure to correctly apply the rule.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4373153"}, {"introduction": "The sharing of \"de-identified\" health data is vital for research, but is this data truly anonymous?

[@problem_id:4856800]", "problem": "A health system publishes a de-identified extract from its Electronic Health Records (EHR) for outpatient encounters in Quarter $1$ of Year $2024$, intended for population health research under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The release is record-level and includes for each patient encounter only three quasi-identifying attributes: clinic visit day-of-week, pharmacy Zone Improvement Plan (ZIP) code prefix (ZIP3, defined as the first three digits of the Zone Improvement Plan (ZIP) code), and age bucket in $10$-year ranges. No direct identifiers are included. Within the extract there are $N = 2{,}100$ unique adult patients. Empirically, the marginal distributions in this clinic network during the quarter are: proportion with pharmacy ZIP3 equal to $607$ is $0.25$, proportion in age bucket $60$–$69$ is $0.12$, and proportion of visits occurring on Wednesday is $0.15$.\n\nSeparately, a member of the public posts two social media check-ins during the same quarter: one at “Riverfront Clinic” on Wednesday and another at “Oak Pharmacy,” whose address is publicly listed in ZIP3 $607$. Their public profile also displays a “Happy $65$th Birthday” photo, suggesting age bucket $60$–$69$. Assume these postings are truthful and temporally aligned with the dataset’s period.\n\nStarting from fundamental privacy principles and core definitions in data protection, reason about how combining innocuous quasi-identifiers from the EHR extract with public social media check-ins can narrow identity. Which option below most accurately characterizes the mosaic effect risk in this scenario and the ethically appropriate mitigation under HIPAA?\n\nA. Using the observed marginals and treating the three attributes as approximately independent for a first-order risk estimate, the expected anonymity set for a person matching “Wednesday,” ZIP3 $607$, and age $60$–$69$ is on the order of $N \\times 0.25 \\times 0.12 \\times 0.15 \\approx 9$ records. This small $k$ indicates credible linkage risk from set intersection with public check-ins; ethically, at least one attribute should be coarsened (for example, merge age buckets) or rare combinations suppressed under HIPAA expert determination to achieve a “very small” risk, coupled with access controls.\n\nB. Because neither day-of-week, ZIP3, nor age bucket is Protected Health Information (PHI) by itself, HIPAA Safe Harbor guarantees there is no mosaic effect risk when these are released together, so no additional mitigation is necessary.\n\nC. The expected anonymity set size is $N \\times (0.25 + 0.12 + 0.15) \\approx 1{,}092$, which is sufficiently large that re-identification via social media check-ins is implausible, making further mitigation unnecessary.\n\nD. Even if the intersection yields fewer than $10$ candidates, de-identification eliminates ethical obligations regarding privacy since individual consent is not required for use of de-identified data, so publishing the extract unaltered is acceptable.\n\nE. The mosaic effect requires exact identity matches across datasets; approximate matches like ZIP3 cannot materially contribute to re-identification, so the released attributes are harmless.", "solution": "The problem statement will be validated by first extracting the givens and then assessing them against scientific and logical principles.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n-   Data source: A de-identified extract from an Electronic Health Records (EHR) system for outpatient encounters.\n-   Time period: Quarter $1$ of Year $2024$.\n-   Purpose: Population health research under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\n-   Dataset attributes (quasi-identifiers):\n    1.

The concepts of quasi-identifiers, the mosaic effect (linking separate datasets), HIPAA de-identification standards (Safe Harbor and Expert Determination), and the calculation of an anonymity set size are standard in the fields of health informatics, data security, and statistics. The scenario is a textbook example of a linkage attack.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data ($N$ and marginal probabilities) and a key assumption (independence of attributes) to perform a first-order quantitative risk assessment. The question is specific, asking to characterize the risk and identify an appropriate mitigation strategy based on this assessment.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using objective and precise language. It provides numerical data and refers to specific, real-world regulatory frameworks (HIPAA). It avoids subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, and realistic.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem lies in quantifying the re-identification risk by estimating the size of the anonymity set for an individual who is known to possess a specific combination of quasi-identifiers. This is an application of the \"mosaic effect,\" where combining a supposedly anonymous dataset (the EHR extract) with a public dataset (social media posts) can compromise privacy.\n\nThe size of the anonymity set, often denoted by $k$ in the context of $k$-anonymity, is the number of individuals in the dataset who share the same combination of quasi-identifiers. A smaller value of $k$ indicates a higher risk of re-identification. We are asked to calculate the *expected* size of this set.\n\nGiven attributes for the target individual:\n1.  Visit day = Wednesday\n2.  Pharmacy ZIP3 = $607$\n3.  Age Bucket = $60$–$69$ years\n\nThe marginal probabilities for these attributes are given as:\n-   $p_{\\text{day}} = P(\\text{visit on Wednesday}) = 0.15$\n-   $p_{\\text{zip}} = P(\\text{pharmacy ZIP3 is 607}) = 0.25$\n-   $p_{\\text{age}} = P(\\text{age is 60-69}) = 0.12$\n\nThe problem specifies that for a first-order estimate, we should assume the attributes are independent. Under the assumption of independence, the joint probability of a record having all three attributes is the product of their marginal probabilities:\n$$p_{\\text{joint}} = p_{\\text{day}} \\times p_{\\text{zip}} \\times p_{\\text{age}}$$\n$$p_{\\text{joint}} = 0.15 \\times 0.25 \\times 0.12$$\n$$p_{\\text{joint}} = 0.0375 \\times 0.12 = 0.0045$$\n\nThe total number of unique patients in the dataset is $N = 2{,}100$. The expected number of patients matching this specific combination of attributes, which is the expected size of the anonymity set ($k_{\\text{expected}}$), is:\n$$k_{\\text{expected}} = N \\times p_{\\text{joint}}$$\n$$k_{\\text{expected}} = 2{,}100 \\times 0.0045 = 9.45$$\n\nAn expected anonymity set size of approximately $9$ is very small and represents a significant privacy risk. If an adversary knows these three facts about a person, they can narrow down the candidates in the health dataset to a small group of about $9$ individuals. This is a successful demonstration of the mosaic effect and constitutes a potential breach of privacy. Under HIPAA's Expert Determination standard, the risk of re-identification must be \"very small.\" A $k$-value of $9$ is unlikely to meet this standard without further justification or controls.\n\nAppropriate mitigation techniques for such a risk include data generalization (e.g., coarsening attributes, such as expanding age buckets to $20$-year ranges or grouping days into \"weekday\" vs. \"weekend\") and suppression (e.g., removing records with rare combinations of attributes). These actions increase the size of anonymity sets.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Using the observed marginals and treating the three attributes as approximately independent for a first-order risk estimate, the expected anonymity set for a person matching “Wednesday,” ZIP3 $607$, and age $60$–$69$ is on the order of $N \\times 0.25 \\times 0.12 \\times 0.15 \\approx 9$ records. This small $k$ indicates credible linkage risk from set intersection with public check-ins; ethically, at least one attribute should be coarsened (for example, merge age buckets) or rare combinations suppressed under HIPAA expert determination to achieve a “very small” risk, coupled with access controls.**\n\n-   **Calculation**: The calculation $N \\times 0.25 \\times 0.12 \\times 0.15 = 2{,}100 \\times 0.0045 = 9.45 \\approx 9$ is correct.\n-   **Risk Assessment**: The conclusion that a small $k$ of $\\approx 9$ indicates a \"credible linkage risk\" is correct. This is the essence of the mosaic effect.\n-   **Mitigation Strategy**: The proposed mitigations—coarsening attributes (generalization), suppressing rare combinations, and framing this within the HIPAA Expert Determination method to achieve a \"very small\" risk—are the standard, ethically and regulatorily appropriate responses to this type of quantified risk.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Because neither day-of-week, ZIP3, nor age bucket is Protected Health Information (PHI) by itself, HIPAA Safe Harbor guarantees there is no mosaic effect risk when these are released together, so no additional mitigation is necessary.**\n\n-   **Analysis**:This statement is fundamentally flawed.\n    1.  The HIPAA Safe Harbor method requires the removal of $18$ specific identifiers. This list includes dates and geographic subdivisions smaller than a state, such as ZIP codes. While a full date is not provided, the day of the week is a temporal element. More critically, a three-digit ZIP code (ZIP3) is only permissible under Safe Harbor if the corresponding geographic area contains more than $20{,}000$ people; otherwise, it must be converted to $000$. The problem does not provide this census information, so we cannot assume Safe Harbor is met.\n    2.  Safe Harbor is a prescriptive list; it does not \"guarantee there is no mosaic effect risk.\" It is a legal-regulatory standard that, if met, deems the data de-identified. It does not eliminate risk in an absolute sense, and it certainly does not apply if its requirements are not strictly followed. The very concept of QIs and the mosaic effect is about how items that are not *direct* identifiers can be combined to re-identify.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The expected anonymity set size is $N \\times (0.25 + 0.12 + 0.15) \\approx 1{,}092$, which is sufficiently large that re-identification via social media check-ins is implausible, making further mitigation unnecessary.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: The calculation is mathematically incorrect. It adds the probabilities of the attributes. To find the probability of the intersection of independent events, one must multiply the probabilities, not add them. Adding probabilities would correspond to the probability of the union of mutually exclusive events, which is irrelevant to finding the group of individuals who share *all* three attributes. The calculation $N \\times (0.25 + 0.12 + 0.15) = 2{,}100 \\times 0.52 = 1{,}092$ is nonsensical in this context.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Even if the intersection yields fewer than $10$ candidates, de-identification eliminates ethical obligations regarding privacy since individual consent is not required for use of de-identified data, so publishing the extract unaltered is acceptable.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: This is ethically and legally incorrect. The term \"de-identified\" is not a magical charm that absolves an entity of all responsibility. De-identification is the *process* of mitigating privacy risk. If the process is performed poorly, such that the risk of re-identification remains high, the data holder has failed in their ethical duty to protect the subjects' privacy. The reason consent is not required for de-identified data is the *presumption* that privacy is adequately protected. If this presumption is false, as it is in this high-risk scenario, publishing the data is not ethically acceptable.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The mosaic effect requires exact identity matches across datasets; approximate matches like ZIP3 cannot materially contribute to re-identification, so the released attributes are harmless.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: This statement fundamentally misunderstands the mosaic effect and the nature of quasi-identifiers. The power of the mosaic effect comes precisely from linking datasets on attributes that are not unique identifiers. Quasi-identifiers like ZIP code, date of birth, and gender are the classic agents of re-identification. A ZIP3 is a very strong quasi-identifier, narrowing a person's likely location from an entire country to a handful of postal areas. To state that it cannot \"materially contribute\" is patently false.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4856800"}]}
