They define an “access gap index” as the expected fraction of individuals in the service population who would be unable to complete a baseline video visit due to encountering at least one of three barriers: lack of broadband, lack of a compatible device, or low digital literacy. Surveillance data suggest that the marginal prevalence of these barriers in the target population are $20\\%$, $15\\%$, and $10\\%$, respectively. For this initial estimate, assume that these barriers occur independently across individuals. Using only first principles of probability (event complements and independence), compute the access gap index, defined as the probability that a randomly selected individual experiences at least one of the three barriers. Express your final answer as a decimal (no percent sign), and round to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of an \"access gap index,\" which is defined as the probability that a randomly selected individual from a target population experiences at least one of three specified barriers to telemedicine.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the problem by defining the relevant events and their probabilities based on the provided data.\nLet $B$ be the event that an individual lacks broadband.\nLet $D$ be the event that an individual lacks a compatible device.\nLet $L$ be the event that an individual has low digital literacy.\n\nThe marginal prevalences of these barriers are given as probabilities:\nThe probability of lacking broadband is $P(B) = 20\\% = 0.20$.\nThe probability of lacking a compatible device is $P(D) = 15\\% = 0.15$.\nThe probability of low digital literacy is $P(L) = 10\\% = 0.10$.\n\nThe \"access gap index\" is the probability of encountering at least one of these barriers. In the language of probability theory, this corresponds to the probability of the union of the events $B$, $D$, and $L$. We are thus required to compute $P(B \\cup D \\cup L)$.\n\nThe problem states that we should assume these barriers occur independently. This is a critical assumption that simplifies the calculation. It means that the occurrence of one barrier does not influence the probability of the occurrence of another.\n\nThe problem also suggests using the principle of event complements. This is an efficient method for calculating the probability of \"at least one\" event. The complement of the event \"at least one barrier occurs\" (i.e., $B \\cup D \\cup L$) is the event \"no barriers occur.\" This latter event corresponds to an individual having broadband, having a compatible device, AND having adequate digital literacy.\n\nLet $B^c$, $D^c$, and $L^c$ be the complement events.\n$B^c$: The individual has broadband.\n$D^c$: The individual has a compatible device.\n$L^c$: The individual does not have low digital literacy (i.e., has adequate digital literacy).\n\nThe probabilities of these complement events can be calculated using the formula $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$:\n$P(B^c) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$\n$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85$\n$P(L^c) = 1 - P(L) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$\n\nThe event \"no barriers occur\" is the intersection of these complement events: $B^c \\cap D^c \\cap L^c$.\nA fundamental property of independent events is that their complements are also independent. Therefore, we can calculate the probability of the intersection by multiplying the individual probabilities:\n$$P(B^c \\cap D^c \\cap L^c) = P(B^c) \\times P(D^c) \\times P(L^c)$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$P(B^c \\cap D^c \\cap L^c) = 0.80 \\times 0.85 \\times 0.90$$\n$$P(B^c \\cap D^c \\cap L^c) = 0.68 \\times 0.90 = 0.612$$\nThis is the probability that a randomly selected individual experiences none of the three barriers.\n\nThe probability of the original event, $P(B \\cup D \\cup L)$, is $1$ minus the probability of its complement:\n$$P(B \\cup D \\cup L) = 1 - P((B \\cup D \\cup L)^c)$$\nBy De Morgan's laws, $(B \\cup D \\cup L)^c = B^c \\cap D^c \\cap L^c$. Therefore:\n$$P(B \\cup D \\cup L) = 1 - P(B^c \\cap D^c \\cap L^c)$$\nSubstituting the value we found for the probability of the complement:\n$$P(B \\cup D \\cup L) = 1 - 0.612 = 0.388$$\n\nThe calculated access gap index is $0.388$. The problem requires this to be expressed as a decimal rounded to three significant figures. The value $0.388$ already has exactly three significant figures ($3$, $8$, $8$), so no further rounding is necessary.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.388}$$", "id": "4861477"}, {"introduction": "Beyond ensuring access, ethical implementation of digital health requires that the tools themselves perform fairly across different populations.

This involves calculating the false positive rate and false negative rate for two demographic cohorts, Group A and Group B, and then quantifying the disparity between them.\n\nFirst, we must define the performance metrics based on the components of a confusion matrix: true positives ($TP$), false positives ($FP$), false negatives ($FN$), and true negatives ($TN$).\nThe total number of actual positive instances is given by $P = TP + FN$.\nThe total number of actual negative instances is given by $N = FP + TN$.\n\nThe False Positive Rate ($FPR$) is the proportion of actual negatives that are incorrectly classified as positive.

This means two conditions must be met simultaneously:\n1. $FPR_A = FPR_B$\n2. $FNR_A = FNR_B$\n\nLet's check these conditions with our calculated values:\n1. For the false positive rates: $FPR_A = 0.15$ and $FPR_B = 0.30$. Since $0.15 \\neq 0.30$, this condition is not met.\n2. For the false negative rates: $FNR_A = 0.15$ and $FNR_B = 0.30$. Since $0.15 \\neq 0.30$, this condition is also not met.\n\nSince neither condition is satisfied, the AI tool does not satisfy the equalized odds criterion for Group A and Group B.\n\nThe final step is to compute the equalized odds violation score, defined as the maximum of the absolute differences between the groups’ false positive rates and false negative rates.\nThe violation score, $V$, is given by:\n$$V = \\max(|FPR_A - FPR_B|, |FNR_A - FNR_B|)$$\n\nWe calculate the absolute differences:\nAbsolute difference in $FPR$: $|FPR_A - FPR_B| = |0.15 - 0.30| = |-0.15| = 0.15$\nAbsolute difference in $FNR$: $|FNR_A - FNR_B| = |0.15 - 0.30| = |-0.15| = 0.15$\n\nNow, we find the maximum of these two values:\n$$V = \\max(0.15, 0.15) = 0.15$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.

The platform is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), but due to rural bandwidth limitations, the video freezes every $10$ seconds and drops frames, making visualization of subtle facial asymmetry and limb drift unreliable. Audio remains mostly clear. No caregiver is immediately present. The patient is concerned about the cost of ambulance transport but agrees that the symptoms are new and significant. The physician can switch to an audio-only backup line and can, with the patient’s consent, contact local emergency medical services.\n\nStarting from core definitions in medical ethics and fiduciary law, assume the following foundational principles apply: physicians owe a fiduciary duty of loyalty (prioritizing the patient’s interests), a duty of care (competence and adherence to the standard of care), duties of informed disclosure and consent (including disclosure of telemedicine limitations), nonmaleficence (avoidance of preventable harm), beneficence (promotion of patient well-being), respect for autonomy (supporting informed decision-making), and justice (fair access to appropriate care).

The task is to determine which of the proposed actions are ethically permissible and aligned with the physician's fiduciary obligations, based on a provided set of ethical principles.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Patient: $68$-year-old.\n- Clinical Presentation: Sudden onset slurred speech and right-sided facial droop.\n- Onset Time: Approximately $20$ minutes prior to the visit.\n- Consultation Modality: Synchronous video via a HIPAA-compliant platform.\n- Technical Issues: Rural bandwidth limitations cause the video to freeze every $10$ seconds and drop frames, making visual assessment unreliable. Audio is mostly clear.\n- Patient Context: No caregiver present. The patient is concerned about ambulance costs but acknowledges the symptoms are new and significant.\n- Physician Capabilities: Can switch to an audio-only line and can contact emergency medical services (EMS) with patient consent.\n- Governing Principles:\n    1.  Fiduciary duty of loyalty (patient's interests are primary).\n    2.  Duty of care (competence, adherence to standard of care, adapting to modality).\n    3.  Informed disclosure and consent (including technological limitations).\n    4.  Nonmaleficence (avoiding preventable harm).\n    5.  Beneficence (promoting patient well-being).\n    6.  Respect for autonomy (supporting informed patient decisions).\n    7.  Justice (fair access to appropriate care).\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is valid.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The clinical presentation is a classic scenario for a potential acute cerebrovascular accident (stroke), which is a time-sensitive medical emergency. The technical challenges described are realistic for telemedicine encounters. The ethical principles listed are the foundational tenets of modern medical ethics.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear scenario, a set of constraints, and a specific question. It asks to evaluate a set of actions against a defined ethical framework, which allows for a structured and logical analysis.\n- **Objective:** The language is clinical and neutral. It presents the facts of the case, including the patient's subjective cost concerns, as objective data for the ethical calculus.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid and well-posed. The scenario requires a rigorous application of the stated ethical principles to a high-stakes clinical situation constrained by technology.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe central issue is a suspected acute stroke, where \"time is brain.\" The standard of care requires immediate evaluation at a facility capable of neuroimaging (e.g., CT scan) to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke and to initiate time-sensitive treatment (e.g., thrombolysis or thrombectomy). The unreliable video feed prevents the physician from performing an adequate neurologic examination, which is a key component of the standard of care. This technological failure elevates the risk to the patient and places a high burden on the physician to act decisively in the patient's best interest.\n\nThe physician's actions must be guided by the principles of beneficence (acting to secure the patient's health) and nonmaleficence (avoiding the harm of delayed or incorrect treatment). This must be balanced with respect for the patient's autonomy, which requires a process of informed consent that fully discloses the high risks of the situation and the limitations of the telemedicine visit. The fiduciary duty of loyalty demands that the patient's immediate medical safety supersede all other concerns, including the physician's liability or the patient's non-urgent financial worries.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Advise immediate in-person emergency evaluation; obtain explicit consent to contact local emergency medical services; remain connected to support the patient until handoff; clearly document the limitations of the video assessment and the clinical reasoning leading to urgent escalation.**\nThis option directly addresses the medical emergency while upholding all key principles.\n- **Beneficence/Nonmaleficence:** Advising immediate emergency evaluation is the only course of action that promotes patient well-being and avoids the harm of a delayed diagnosis for a potential stroke.\n- **Respect for Autonomy:** Obtaining explicit consent to contact EMS respects the patient's right to make decisions, but does so after the physician has provided a strong, clear recommendation based on medical urgency (informed consent).\n- **Duty of Care/Fiduciary Duty:** Remaining connected until handoff prevents patient abandonment and ensures continuity of care during a vulnerable period.\n- **Disclosure:** Documenting limitations and reasoning is integral to professional competence and transparency.\nThis action sequence is a model response to the crisis.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Continue attempting a full remote neurologic examination for an additional $30$ minutes to maximize documentation before recommending in-person care, specifically to reduce potential liability exposure, despite ongoing video instability and persistent high-risk symptoms.**\nThis option prioritizes the physician's self-interest over the patient's life-threatening condition.\n- **Fiduciary Duty of Loyalty:** This is a flagrant violation. The physician's interest in liability protection is placed above the patient's critical need for timely care.\n- **Nonmaleficence:** Delaying care by $30$ minutes for a stroke, for a non-medical reason, directly exposes the patient to the risk of significant and preventable harm (increased morbidity and mortality).\n- **Duty of Care:** Continuing to use a tool (unstable video) known to be inadequate for the task is incompetent and falls below the standard of care.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Switch to an audio-only backup immediately; conduct a structured, modality-appropriate neurologic assessment; explicitly disclose residual diagnostic uncertainty due to lack of reliable video; if key elements cannot be assessed or concerning findings persist, recommend and facilitate urgent in-person evaluation.**\nThis option describes a thoughtful and methodologically sound process for managing the technological failure.\n- **Duty of Care:** It demonstrates adaptation to modality limitations by switching to a stable channel (audio) and attempting a limited but structured assessment (e.g., assessing speech, cognition, ability to follow commands).\n- **Disclosure:** It explicitly acknowledges the diagnostic uncertainty, fulfilling the duty of informed disclosure.\n- **Beneficence/Nonmaleficence:** The process is governed by a clear endpoint: if the assessment is insufficient or concerns persist (which they inevitably will, given the inability to assess for facial droop or limb drift visually), the physician will escalate to in-person care. This process does not introduce undue delay but rather establishes a logical basis for the necessary escalation, which fully aligns with promoting the patient's well-being. This entire process can be executed in a minute or two, leading directly to the recommendation for EMS. It is an ethically sound pathway.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. Offer to prescribe oral aspirin to mitigate possible ischemic events and recommend home monitoring for $24$ hours, deferring any recommendation for immediate in-person evaluation given the patient’s cost concerns.**\nThis option is medically dangerous and unethical.\n- **Nonmaleficence:** Administering aspirin without ruling out a hemorrhagic stroke (which requires neuroimaging) can be fatal. This action constitutes a grave and avoidable harm. This is a \"first, do no harm\" violation.\n- **Duty of Care:** Recommending home monitoring for a suspected acute stroke is a profound deviation from the standard of care.\n- **Respect for Autonomy vs. Beneficence:** While acknowledging the patient's cost concerns, a physician cannot ethically allow those concerns to lead to a medically catastrophic outcome. The duty of beneficence requires the physician to advocate strongly for the life-saving intervention, not to offer a dangerous and substandard alternative.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Send a HIPAA-compliant secure message summarizing red-flag symptoms and generic instructions to go to the emergency department, then end the visit without confirming real-time understanding, without arranging immediate assistance, and without staying connected to ensure safe transition.**\nThis option constitutes patient abandonment.\n- **Duty of Care:** A physician-patient relationship has been established. Terminating it by sending a message and disconnecting fails the duty to ensure care is safely transitioned, especially for a patient who may be neurologically impaired and unable to act on the instructions.\n- **Fiduciary Duty:** This action serves the physician's convenience rather than the patient's safety, violating the duty of loyalty. The \"fire and forget\" approach is unacceptable in an emergency.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**F. Terminate the visit due to platform video instability, disclaim responsibility for further care, and instruct the patient to reconnect later when bandwidth improves, without providing safety nets or alternative routes of evaluation.**\nThis is an extreme and unambiguous case of patient abandonment.\n- **Duty of Care, Nonmaleficence, Beneficence, Fiduciary Duty:** This action violates every core duty. The physician would be actively deserting a patient in a moment of extreme medical peril. The instruction to \"reconnect later\" is medically absurd in the context of a stroke and would almost certainly lead to catastrophic harm.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nIn summary, Options A and C represent ethically permissible and professionally responsible courses of action. Option A describes the necessary destination (urgent escalation and handoff), while Option C describes a valid and thoughtful process to arrive at that same conclusion while managing the immediate technological failure. Both are consistent with the governing principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "4861516"}]}
