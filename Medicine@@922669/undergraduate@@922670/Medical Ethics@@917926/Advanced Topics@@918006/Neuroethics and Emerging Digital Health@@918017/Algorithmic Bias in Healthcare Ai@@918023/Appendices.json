The concepts of confusion matrices and disparate impact are standard in the evaluation of machine learning models.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the disparate impact ratio (DIR), which is defined as the ratio of the selection rates for two groups. The selection rate for a given group is the proportion of individuals in that group who receive a positive prediction. The prediction $\\hat{Y}=1$ corresponds to a positive prediction (recommending expedited review).\n\nLet $g$ represent a group, where $g \\in \\{A, B\\}$. The components of the confusion matrix for each group are given:\n- True Positives ($TP_g$): Correctly predicted positive instances.\n- False Positives ($FP_g$): Incorrectly predicted positive instances.\n- False Negatives ($FN_g$): Incorrectly predicted negative instances.\n- True Negatives ($TN_g$): Correctly predicted negative instances.\n\nThe total number of individuals in group $g$ is denoted by $N_g$ and is the sum of all outcomes in the confusion matrix:\n$$N_g = TP_g + FP_g + FN_g + TN_g$$\n\nThe total number of positive predictions for group $g$ is the sum of true positives and false positives:\n$$\\text{Positive Predictions}_g = TP_g + FP_g$$\n\nThe selection rate for group $g$, denoted $SR_g$, is the conditional probability of receiving a positive prediction given membership in group $g$, $P(\\hat{Y}=1 | G=g)$.

The given data are:\n- $TP_A = 180$\n- $FP_A = 120$\n- $FN_A = 70$\n- $TN_A = 430$\n\nThe total number of individuals in group $A$ is:\n$$N_A = 180 + 120 + 70 + 430 = 800$$\nThe number of positive predictions for group $A$ is:\n$$\\text{Positive Predictions}_A = 180 + 120 = 300$$\nTherefore, the selection rate for group $A$ is:\n$$SR_A = \\frac{300}{800} = \\frac{3}{8} = 0.375$$\n\nNext, we calculate the selection rate for group $B$. The given data are:\n- $TP_B = 210$\n- $FP_B = 90$\n- $FN_B = 40$\n- $TN_B = 260$\n\nThe total number of individuals in group $B$ is:\n$$N_B = 210 + 90 + 40 + 260 = 600$$\nThe number of positive predictions for group $B$ is:\n$$\\text{Positive Predictions}_B = 210 + 90 = 300$$\nTherefore, the selection rate for group $B$ is:\n$$SR_B = \\frac{300}{600} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$$\n\nThe disparate impact ratio (DIR) is defined as the ratio of the selection rate for group $A$ to that of the reference group $B$:\n$$DIR = \\frac{SR_A}{SR_B}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$DIR = \\frac{0.375}{0.5} = \\frac{3/8}{1/2} = \\frac{3}{8} \\times \\frac{2}{1} = \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$$\n\nThe problem also requires an evaluation using the four-fifths rule. This rule is a common guideline used to assess disparate impact. It states that the selection rate of a protected group (in this case, group $A$) should be at least $80\\%$ (or $0.8$) of the selection rate of the group with the highest rate (the reference group, group $B$). Mathematically, the model satisfies the rule if:\n$$\\frac{SR_A}{SR_B} \\ge 0.8$$\nOur computed disparate impact ratio is $DIR = 0.75$. Comparing this value to the threshold:\n$$0.75 < 0.8$$\nThis inequality shows that the model does not satisfy the four-fifths rule, as the selection rate for group $A$ is only $75\\%$ of the selection rate for group $B$, which is below the $80\\%$ threshold.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of the disparate impact ratio, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$DIR = 0.7500$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7500}$$", "id": "4849763"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond just the rate of recommendations, our next exercise examines the reliability of those recommendations.

Performance disparities in medical AI models across different demographic or clinical groups are a significant real-world concern. The AUC values are typical for a good to excellent predictive model.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. It is validated as a legitimate problem for analysis. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nFirst, we calculate the specified parity metrics using the given values.\nGiven:\n$\\mathrm{AUC}_A = 0.90$\n$\\mathrm{AUC}_B = 0.80$\n\nThe absolute difference in AUC is:\n$$ \\Delta_{\\mathrm{AUC}} = \\left|\\mathrm{AUC}_A - \\mathrm{AUC}_B\\right| = |0.90 - 0.80| = 0.10 $$\n\nThe ratio of AUCs is:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{AUC}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{AUC}_B}{\\mathrm{AUC}_A} = \\frac{0.80}{0.90} = \\frac{8}{9} \\approx 0.888... $$\nRounding to two decimal places gives $R_{\\mathrm{AUC}} \\approx 0.89$.\n\nNext, we address the core conceptual question: Is parity on AUC sufficient to ensure fairness in clinical deployment?\n\nAUC is a measure of a model's discriminatory power, specifically its ability to rank a random positive case higher than a random negative case. It is an aggregate metric that summarizes performance across all possible decision thresholds, $\\tau$. However, clinical utility and fairness are determined by the consequences of decisions made at a *specific, chosen* threshold. The ethical principles of beneficence (doing good), nonmaleficence (avoiding harm), and justice (fair distribution of benefits and burdens) are tied to the real-world outcomes for patients, which depend on the operational threshold.\n\nAUC parity is insufficient for fairness for several critical reasons:\n1.  **Threshold Dependence of Harms:** A clinical system operates at a single threshold $\\tau$. Equal AUCs for two groups do not guarantee equal performance at that specific $\\tau$. Two different ROC curves can enclose the same area ($\\mathrm{AUC}_A = \\mathrm{AUC}_B$) but cross each other. For a given threshold, Group A might have a low $\\mathrm{FPR}$ and high $\\mathrm{TPR}$, while Group B has a high $\\mathrm{FPR}$ and low $\\mathrm{TPR}$. This would lead to a disparity in who receives false alarms (potential for unnecessary, costly, or harmful follow-ups; violating nonmaleficence) and who is missed by the system (potential for untreated disease; violating beneficence). This constitutes an inequitable distribution of harms and benefits, violating justice.\n2.  **Calibration:** AUC measures discrimination (ranking ability), not calibration. Calibration refers to whether the model's output risk score $s$ corresponds to the true probability of the outcome. For example, a well-calibrated model would ensure that among all patients given a score of $s=0.2$, approximately $20\\%$ actually have the condition. A model can have a high AUC but be poorly calibrated, and this miscalibration can differ between groups. For example, a score of $s=0.7$ may mean a $70\\%$ risk for Group A but only a $50\\%$ risk for Group B. Using the same threshold for both groups would lead to systematic overtreatment of Group B relative to their actual risk, which is both inefficient and potentially harmful.\n3.  **Prevalence Differences:** The prevalence of a condition (the proportion of positive cases in a population) can vary between groups. The rates of false positives and false negatives ($\\mathrm{FNR} = 1-\\mathrm{TPR}$) do not directly translate to the likelihood of a given alert being correct. This likelihood is the Positive Predictive Value ($\\mathrm{PPV} = \\frac{\\mathrm{TP}}{\\mathrm{TP}+\\mathrm{FP}}$). By Bayes' theorem, $\\mathrm{PPV}$ is a function of $\\mathrm{TPR}$, $\\mathrm{FPR}$, and prevalence ($\\pi$). Even if a model achieved equal $\\mathrm{TPR}$ and $\\mathrm{FPR}$ across groups (a strong fairness condition known as equalized odds), a difference in prevalence ($\\pi_A \\ne \\pi_B$) would lead to different $\\mathrm{PPV}$s ($\\mathrm{PPV}_A \\ne \\mathrm{PPV}_B$). This means the clinical team's trust in a positive alert would be different for the two groups, potentially leading to differential allocation of attention and resources, an issue of justice.\n\nTherefore, relying solely on an aggregate, threshold-independent metric like AUC is insufficient for a comprehensive fairness assessment. A thorough evaluation must consider threshold-specific error rates ($\\mathrm{TPR}$, $\\mathrm{FPR}$), model calibration, and the impact of prevalence on predictive values.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{AUC}} = 0.10$ and $R_{\\mathrm{AUC}} \\approx 0.89$.

Equal AUC always guarantees equal False Positive Rate and False Negative Rate at any clinically chosen threshold, so AUC parity ensures fairness.**\n-   **Calculation:** The problem states $\\mathrm{AUC}_A = 0.90$ and $\\mathrm{AUC}_B = 0.80$, so $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{AUC}} = 0.10$ and $R_{\\mathrm{AUC}} \\approx 0.89$. The values in this option are factually incorrect based on the problem statement.\n-   **Reasoning:** The claim that equal AUC guarantees equal $\\mathrm{FPR}$ and $\\mathrm{FNR}$ (where $\\mathrm{FNR}=1-\\mathrm{TPR}$) at any threshold is fundamentally false. As explained above, different ROC curves can have identical areas.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{AUC}} = 0.10$ and $R_{\\mathrm{AUC}} \\approx 0.89$. Any nonzero AUC gap definitively proves the model violates the ethical principle of justice and must be rejected without further analysis.**\n-   **Calculation:** The calculated values are correct.\n-   **Reasoning:** This statement is too absolute. While a performance gap like this is a significant concern that certainly *implicates* the principle of justice, it does not mean the model must be rejected \"without further analysis.\" Ethical decision-making in medicine involves weighing principles. If the model, despite the gap, provides a substantial net benefit to *both* groups over the status quo (e.g., no model), rejecting it outright could violate the principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence for all patients. The proper course is a deeper analysis of trade-offs, not summary rejection.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $R_{\\mathrm{AUC}} = \\frac{0.80}{0.90} \\approx 0.89$. Parity on AUC is sufficient because AUC summarizes all clinically relevant performance; if AUCs were equal, the model would be fair regardless of calibration or thresholding.**\n-   **Calculation:** The calculation of $R_{\\mathrm{AUC}}$ is correct.\n-   **Reasoning:** The central claim that \"parity on AUC is sufficient\" and that it \"summarizes all clinically relevant performance\" is false. This statement embodies the common misconception that AUC is an all-encompassing measure of model quality. As detailed in the derivation, it ignores critical, clinically relevant aspects like calibration and threshold-specific performance.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{AUC}} = 0.10$. Because AUC is threshold-independent, the group with lower prevalence will necessarily have higher Positive Predictive Value at the decision threshold, so equalizing AUC yields fair resource allocation across groups.**\n-   **Calculation:** The value for $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{AUC}}$ is correct.\n-   **Reasoning:** The statement contains multiple errors. The connection between AUC's threshold-independence and PPV is spurious. More critically, the claim that lower prevalence leads to *higher* PPV is false. A lower prevalence ($\\pi$), holding all else equal, leads to a *lower* PPV. This can be seen from the PPV formula, $\\mathrm{PPV}(\\pi) = \\frac{\\mathrm{TPR} \\cdot \\pi}{\\mathrm{TPR} \\cdot \\pi + \\mathrm{FPR} \\cdot (1-\\pi)}$, which is an increasing function of $\\pi$. The conclusion about fair resource allocation is therefore based on flawed premises.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option A is the only one that is correct in both its calculations and its sophisticated understanding of the role of AUC in fairness evaluations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4849739"}]}
