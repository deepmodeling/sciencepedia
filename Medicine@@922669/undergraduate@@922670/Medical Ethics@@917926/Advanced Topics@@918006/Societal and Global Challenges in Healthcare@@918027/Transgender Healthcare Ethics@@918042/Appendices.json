To guide ethical decision-making under the principles of beneficence and non-maleficence, the clinician adopts the expected utility decision rule from decision theory: choose the action with the highest expected utility.

It models an ethical decision-making process using a quantitative framework, devoid of subjective or biased assertions.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe decision is to be guided by the expected utility ($EU$) rule. The expected utility of an action is the sum of the utilities of all possible outcomes, with each utility value weighted by its probability of occurrence. For a set of discrete, mutually exclusive outcomes $O_i$ with probabilities $p(O_i)$ and utilities $U(O_i)$, the expected utility is given by:\n$$EU = \\sum_{i} p(O_i) U(O_i)$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the utility is additively separable across two categories: benefit and harm. This allows us to calculate the total expected utility of initiating therapy, denoted $EU_{therapy}$, as the sum of the expected utility derived from the potential for benefit and the expected utility derived from the potential for harm.\n$$EU_{therapy} = EU(\\text{Benefit}) + EU(\\text{Harm})$$\n\nFirst, let's analyze the benefit category. There are two outcomes: a benefit occurs, or it does not.\n- The probability of a benefit occurring is $p_{B}$. The utility associated with this outcome is given by the magnitude $u_{B}$.\n- The probability of no benefit occurring is $1 - p_{B}$. The utility of this outcome (no change) is implicitly $0$.\nThe expected utility from the benefit category, $EU(\\text{Benefit})$, is therefore:\n$$EU(\\text{Benefit}) = p_{B} \\cdot u_{B} + (1 - p_{B}) \\cdot 0 = p_{B} u_{B}$$\n\nNext, we analyze the harm category. The problem states that \"harms contribute negatively to overall utility.\"\n- The probability of a harm occurring is $p_{H}$. The utility magnitude of the harm is $u_{H}$. Since harms contribute negatively, the utility value of this outcome is $-u_{H}$.\n- The probability of no harm occurring is $1 - p_{H}$. The utility associated with this outcome is $0$.\nThe expected utility from the harm category, $EU(\\text{Harm})$, is therefore:\n$$EU(\\text{Harm}) = p_{H} \\cdot (-u_{H}) + (1 - p_{H}) \\cdot 0 = -p_{H} u_{H}$$\n\nUsing the principle of additive separability, we sum the expected utilities from the two categories to find the total expected utility of initiating therapy:\n$$EU_{therapy} = EU(\\text{Benefit}) + EU(\\text{Harm}) = p_{B} u_{B} - p_{H} u_{H}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the expected utility of initiating therapy.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for the specific case provided:\n- $p_{B} = 0.7$\n- $u_{B} = 0.8$\n- $p_{H} = 0.02$\n- $u_{H} = 0.9$\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived expression:\n$$EU_{therapy} = (0.7) \\cdot (0.8) - (0.02) \\cdot (0.9)$$\n$$EU_{therapy} = 0.56 - 0.018$$\n$$EU_{therapy} = 0.542$$\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $0.542$ already has three significant figures (the digits $5$, $4$, and $2$). Therefore, no further rounding is necessary.\nThe final expected utility is a dimensionless value, as utility is a dimensionless measure in this context.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.542}\n$$", "id": "4889228"}, {"introduction": "Medical decisions are rarely simple, often involving multiple steps and deeply personal values that go beyond clinical data.

According to the problem statement, if therapy is immediate, the only relevant utility is that of the therapy benefits.\nThe expected utility of this action, which we denote as $EU_{\\text{immediate}}$, is simply the utility of this certain outcome.\n$$EU_{\\text{immediate}} = U_{\\text{therapy}}$$\n$$EU_{\\text{immediate}} = 0.8$$\n\n**Action 2: Delayed Therapy**\n\nThis action leads to a path with both certain and uncertain components.\nThe certain components are the therapy benefits, which are realized after the delay, and the disutility of the delay itself. Their combined utility is:\n$$U_{\\text{certain}} = U_{\\text{therapy}} + U_{\\text{delay}} = 0.8 + (-0.2) = 0.6$$\nThe uncertain component is the oocyte retrieval procedure. This is a chance node with two possible outcomes:\n1.  **Success**: This occurs with probability $p_s$ and yields a utility of $U_{\\text{success}} = 0.7$.\n2.  **Failure**: This occurs with probability $1 - p_s$ and yields a utility of $U_{\\text{failure}} = 0$.\n\nThe expected utility of the oocyte retrieval procedure, $EU_{\\text{retrieval}}$, is calculated as the sum of the utilities of each outcome weighted by their respective probabilities:\n$$EU_{\\text{retrieval}} = (p_s \\times U_{\\text{success}}) + ((1 - p_s) \\times U_{\\text{failure}})$$\n$$EU_{\\text{retrieval}} = (p_s \\times 0.7) + ((1 - p_s) \\times 0)$$\n$$EU_{\\text{retrieval}} = 0.7 p_s$$\n\nSince utilities are additive, the total expected utility for the \"Delayed Therapy\" action, $EU_{\\text{delayed}}$, is the sum of the utility from the certain components and the expected utility from the uncertain component.\n$$EU_{\\text{delayed}} = U_{\\text{certain}} + EU_{\\text{retrieval}}$$\n$$EU_{\\text{delayed}} = 0.6 + 0.7 p_s$$\n\n**Summary of Results**\n\nThe expected utility for each action is:\n-   Expected Utility of Immediate Therapy: $EU_{\\text{immediate}} = 0.8$\n-   Expected Utility of Delayed Therapy: $EU_{\\text{delayed}} = 0.6 + 0.7 p_s$\n\nThe problem requires reporting these two expressions as a single row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.8 & 0.6 + 0.7 p_s\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4889219"}, {"introduction": "Moving from individual care to public health, the principle of justice requires the fair and equitable allocation of limited resources.
