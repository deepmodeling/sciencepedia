A leximin rule applied to country-average $QALY$ after the allocation.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is a well-defined choice problem in the field of health economics and ethics.\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The concepts of Quality-Adjusted Life Years ($QALYs$), utilitarianism, and leximin are standard, well-established frameworks for analyzing resource allocation in healthcare and public health. The problem does not violate any scientific or logical principles.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly stated. All necessary data to apply the two ethical principles are provided. The terms \"utilitarian aggregation of $QALY$ gains\" and \"leximin rule applied to country-average $QALY$\" are standard and allow for a unique, deterministic solution.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is presented with precise, quantitative data and objective, standard definitions from ethical theory. It is free of subjective or ambiguous language.\n\nAll necessary conditions for a valid problem are met. There are no contradictions, missing pieces of information, or factual errors. The problem is a formalizable and solvable exercise in applied ethics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the preferred allocation under two different ethical frameworks: utilitarianism and leximin.\n\n### 1. Utilitarian Selection\nThe utilitarian principle, in this context, aims to maximize the total or aggregate good. The problem specifies \"utilitarian aggregation of $QALY$ gains\". This means we must select the allocation that produces the greatest total number of $QALYs$ gained across both populations.\n\nThe total $QALY$ gain for an allocation is the sum of the gains in each country.\nLet $G_X$ be the total $QALY$ gain from allocation $X$.\nThe gain in Country $H$ is the average gain per resident multiplied by the population: $\\Delta H_X \\times N = 0.8N$.\nThe gain in Country $L$ is the average gain per resident multiplied by the population: $\\Delta L_X \\times N = 0.3N$.\nSo, the total gain for allocation $X$ is:\n$$G_X = (0.8 \\times N) + (0.3 \\times N) = (0.8 + 0.3)N = 1.1N$$\n\nLet $G_Y$ be the total $QALY$ gain from allocation $Y$.\nThe gain in Country $H$ is: $\\Delta H_Y \\times N = 0.2N$.\nThe gain in Country $L$ is: $\\Delta L_Y \\times N = 0.7N$.\nSo, the total gain for allocation $Y$ is:\n$$G_Y = (0.2 \\times N) + (0.7 \\times N) = (0.2 + 0.7)N = 0.9N$$\n\nTo make the utilitarian choice, we compare the total gains:\n$$G_X = 1.1N \\quad \\text{and} \\quad G_Y = 0.9N$$\nSince $1.1N > 0.9N$, allocation $X$ yields a greater total $QALY$ gain.\nTherefore, a utilitarian framework selects allocation $X$.\n\n### 2. Leximin Selection\nThe leximin (lexicographical maximin) principle focuses on the well-being of the worst-off. It directs us to choose the option that maximizes the minimum utility level. If the minimum levels are equal, we compare the second-worst-off, and so on.\n\nThe problem states that the leximin rule is applied to the \"country-average $QALY$ after the allocation.\" This means we must first calculate the final average health in each country for both allocations and then compare the resulting health distributions.\n\nThe baseline average health levels are $H_0 = 70$ $QALY$ for Country $H$ and $L_0 = 45$ $QALY$ for Country $L$. Country $L$ is the worse-off country at baseline.\n\n**Allocation X:**\n-   Final average health in Country $H$: $H_X = H_0 + \\Delta H_X = 70 + 0.8 = 70.8$ $QALY$.\n-   Final average health in Country $L$: $L_X = L_0 + \\Delta L_X = 45 + 0.3 = 45.3$ $QALY$.\nThe resulting distribution of country-average health is $(70.8, 45.3)$. The minimum level of well-being in this scenario is $45.3$ $QALY$.\n\n**Allocation Y:**\n-   Final average health in Country $H$: $H_Y = H_0 + \\Delta H_Y = 70 + 0.2 = 70.2$ $QALY$.\n-   Final average health in Country $L$: $L_Y = L_0 + \\Delta L_Y = 45 + 0.7 = 45.7$ $QALY$.\nThe resulting distribution of country-average health is $(70.2, 45.7)$. The minimum level of well-being in this scenario is $45.7$ $QALY$.\n\nNow, we apply the leximin rule by comparing the minimums.\n-   Minimum health level under $X$: $\\min(70.8, 45.3) = 45.3$ $QALY$.\n-   Minimum health level under $Y$: $\\min(70.2, 45.7) = 45.7$ $QALY$.\n\nSince $45.7 > 45.3$, allocation $Y$ provides a better outcome for the worst-off country.\nTherefore, the leximin principle selects allocation $Y$.\n\n### Summary of Results\n-   **Utilitarianism** selects $X$.\n-   **Leximin** selects $Y$.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nA. **Utilitarian selects $X$; Leximin selects $Y$.**\nThis matches our derived result. Utilitarianism selects $X$ because $1.1N > 0.9N$. Leximin selects $Y$ because the outcome for the worst-off country is higher ($45.7 > 45.3$).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. **Utilitarian selects $Y$; Leximin selects $X$.**\nThis is incorrect. Utilitarianism selects $X$, not $Y$. Leximin selects $Y$, not $X$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. **Utilitarian selects $X$; Leximin selects $X$.**\nThis is incorrect because leximin selects $Y$, not $X$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. **Utilitarian selects $Y$; Leximin selects $Y$.**\nThis is incorrect because utilitarianism selects $X$, not $Y$.\n** Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4864516"}, {"introduction": "The choice between prioritizing the worst-off and maximizing total health is not always a simple dichotomy; it exists on a spectrum.

All terms are precisely defined, and the data provided is self-contained and consistent. No scientific principles are violated; the problem is a mathematical exercise based on a given theoretical framework. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete and reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to find the value of the inequality aversion parameter, $\\epsilon^{\\star}$, at which the social welfare gains from intervention $\\mathsf{A}$ and intervention $\\mathsf{B}$ are equal.

The condition for this indifference point is given by the equality:\n$$S_{\\mathsf{A}}(\\epsilon^{\\star}) = S_{\\mathsf{B}}(\\epsilon^{\\star})$$\nWe are given the explicit form for the social welfare function $S_{\\mathsf{X}}(\\epsilon)$.

We begin by grouping terms associated with group $1$ on the left side and terms associated with group $2$ on the right side:\n$$N_1\\,h_1^{-\\epsilon^{\\star}}\\,g_{1,\\mathsf{A}} - N_1\\,h_1^{-\\epsilon^{\\star}}\\,g_{1,\\mathsf{B}} = N_2\\,h_2^{-\\epsilon^{\\star}}\\,g_{2,\\mathsf{B}} - N_2\\,h_2^{-\\epsilon^{\\star}}\\,g_{2,\\mathsf{A}}$$\nNext, we factor out the common terms on each side of the equation:\n$$N_1\\,h_1^{-\\epsilon^{\\star}}\\,(g_{1,\\mathsf{A}} - g_{1,\\mathsf{B}}) = N_2\\,h_2^{-\\epsilon^{\\star}}\\,(g_{2,\\mathsf{B}} - g_{2,\\mathsf{A}})$$\nTo isolate the exponential terms involving $\\epsilon^{\\star}$, we divide both sides by $N_1 h_2^{-\\epsilon^\\star} (g_{1,\\mathsf{A}} - g_{1,\\mathsf{B}})$, assuming $(g_{1,\\mathsf{A}} - g_{1,\\mathsf{B}}) \\neq 0$:\n$$\\frac{h_1^{-\\epsilon^{\\star}}}{h_2^{-\\epsilon^{\\star}}} = \\frac{N_2\\,(g_{2,\\mathsf{B}} - g_{2,\\mathsf{A}})}{N_1\\,(g_{1,\\mathsf{A}} - g_{1,\\mathsf{B}})}$$\nUsing the property of exponents $a^{-n}/b^{-n} = (b/a)^n$, we can rewrite the left side:\n$$\\left(\\frac{h_2}{h_1}\\right)^{\\epsilon^{\\star}} = \\frac{N_2\\,(g_{2,\\mathsf{B}} - g_{2,\\mathsf{A}})}{N_1\\,(g_{1,\\mathsf{A}} - g_{1,\\mathsf{B}})}$$\nTo solve for $\\epsilon^{\\star}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$\\ln\\left[\\left(\\frac{h_2}{h_1}\\right)^{\\epsilon^{\\star}}\\right] = \\ln\\left[\\frac{N_2\\,(g_{2,\\mathsf{B}} - g_{2,\\mathsf{A}})}{N_1\\,(g_{1,\\mathsf{A}} - g_{1,\\mathsf{B}})}\\right]$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(a^b) = b\\ln(a)$, we obtain:\n$$\\epsilon^{\\star}\\,\\ln\\left(\\frac{h_2}{h_1}\\right) = \\ln\\left[\\frac{N_2\\,(g_{2,\\mathsf{B}} - g_{2,\\mathsf{A}})}{N_1\\,(g_{1,\\mathsf{A}} - g_{1,\\mathsf{B}})}\\right]$$\nFinally, we can express $\\epsilon^{\\star}$ by dividing by $\\ln(h_2/h_1)$, assuming $h_1 \\neq h_2$:\n$$\\epsilon^{\\star} = \\frac{\\ln\\left[\\frac{N_2\\,(g_{2,\\mathsf{B}} - g_{2,\\mathsf{A}})}{N_1\\,(g_{1,\\mathsf{A}} - g_{1,\\mathsf{B}})}\\right]}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{h_2}{h_1}\\right)}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this derived expression.\nThe givens are:\n$N_1 = 5000$, $N_2 = 10000$\n$h_1 = 0.35$, $h_2 = 0.85$\n$g_{1,\\mathsf{A}} = 0.06$, $g_{1,\\mathsf{B}} = 0.02$\n$g_{2,\\mathsf{A}} = 0.015$, $g_{2,\\mathsf{B}} = 0.04$\n\nFirst, let's compute the differences in gains:\n$$g_{1,\\mathsf{A}} - g_{1,\\mathsf{B}} = 0.06 - 0.02 = 0.04$$\n$$g_{2,\\mathsf{B}} - g_{2,\\mathsf{A}} = 0.04 - 0.015 = 0.025$$\nNote that both differences are positive, which means the right side of the equation for $(\\frac{h_2}{h_1})^{\\epsilon^{\\star}}$ will be positive, ensuring that its logarithm is well-defined.\n\nNext, we compute the ratio in the numerator of the logarithm:\n$$\\frac{N_2\\,(g_{2,\\mathsf{B}} - g_{2,\\mathsf{A}})}{N_1\\,(g_{1,\\mathsf{A}} - g_{1,\\mathsf{B}})} = \\frac{10000 \\times 0.025}{5000 \\times 0.04} = \\frac{250}{200} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25$$\nNext, we compute the ratio of baseline health levels:\n$$\\frac{h_2}{h_1} = \\frac{0.85}{0.35} = \\frac{85}{35} = \\frac{17}{7}$$\nSubstituting these values back into the expression for $\\epsilon^{\\star}$:\n$$\\epsilon^{\\star} = \\frac{\\ln(1.25)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{17}{7}\\right)}$$\nWe now compute the numerical value:\n$$\\ln(1.25) \\approx 0.22314355$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{17}{7}\\right) \\approx \\ln(2.4285714...) \\approx 0.88726880$$\n$$\\epsilon^{\\star} \\approx \\frac{0.22314355}{0.88726880} \\approx 0.2514902$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\epsilon^{\\star} \\approx 0.251$$\nThis value of $\\epsilon^{\\star}$ indicates the level of inequality aversion required to be indifferent between intervention $\\mathsf{A}$, which provides a larger benefit to the worse-off group, and intervention $\\mathsf{B}$, which provides a larger aggregate benefit but favors the better-off group more than $\\mathsf{A}$ does.

A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires a demonstration of how a GDP-based cost-effectiveness threshold can be misleading and a calculation of the net health difference between two allocation choices. The analysis will proceed from first principles based on the concept of opportunity cost.\n\nFirst, we calculate the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio ($ICER$) for the new intervention. The incremental cost $C$ is the donor's budget of $\\$10,000,000$, and the incremental health benefit $H$ is the $20,000$ DALYs averted.\n\n$$\nICER = \\frac{C}{H} = \\frac{\\$10,000,000}{20,000 \\text{ DALYs}} = \\$500 \\text{ per DALY}\n$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the allocation decision using the two different frameworks presented: the GDP-per-capita rule and the opportunity cost principle.\n\n**1. Analysis using the GDP-per-capita Threshold**\n\nThe common heuristic is to fund an intervention if its $ICER$ is less than or equal to a threshold, here set at $1$ times the GDP per capita. For both Country $X$ and Country $Y$, the GDP per capita is $\\$1,500$. The threshold is therefore $\\$1,500$ per DALY.\n\nThe intervention's $ICER$ is $\\$500$ per DALY. Since $ICER = \\$500 < \\$1,500$, this rule suggests that the intervention is \"cost-effective\" in both Country $X$ and Country $Y$. This immediately highlights a deficiency of this universalist threshold: it fails to provide a basis for choosing *between* the two countries. More critically, as will be shown, it wrongly classifies the intervention as a good investment in one of the settings, thereby misguiding the allocation.\n\n**2. Analysis using the Opportunity Cost Principle**\n\nThe ethically and economically sound approach is to consider the opportunity cost of the investment. The budget of $C = \\$10,000,000$, if used for the new intervention, is diverted from other potential uses. The problem specifies that this diversion displaces health activities at the margin of the existing health system. The cost of producing one DALY at this margin is the health system's marginal productivity, $\\lambda$.\n\nThe net health benefit ($\\Delta H_{\\text{net}}$) of the new intervention is the health it generates ($H$) minus the health forgone from displaced activities ($H_{\\text{lost}}$). The health lost is a direct consequence of the budget $C$ no longer being available to produce health at a rate of $\\lambda$ dollars per DALY.\n\n$$\nH_{\\text{lost}} = \\frac{C}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nThus, the net health benefit is:\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\text{net}} = H - H_{\\text{lost}} = H - \\frac{C}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nFor an intervention to be a worthwhile investment, it must produce a net positive health benefit, i.e., $\\Delta H_{\\text{net}} > 0$.\n$$\nH - \\frac{C}{\\lambda} > 0 \\implies H > \\frac{C}{\\lambda} \\implies \\lambda > \\frac{C}{H}\n$$\nGiven the definition $ICER = \\frac{C}{H}$, the correct condition for a cost-effective intervention is:\n$$\n\\lambda > ICER\n$$\nThe cost-effectiveness threshold should not be a generic value like GDP per capita, but the specific, context-dependent marginal productivity of the health system, $\\lambda$, which represents the true opportunity cost of the funds.\n\nWe now apply this correct criterion to each country:\n-   **Country X**: The marginal productivity is $\\lambda_X = \\$150$ per DALY. The intervention's $ICER$ is $\\$500$ per DALY. Here, $\\$150 < \\$500$, so $\\lambda_X < ICER$. The condition for net health gain is not met. Allocating the budget to Country $X$ would result in a net health *loss*.\n-   **Country Y**: The marginal productivity is $\\lambda_Y = \\$600$ per DALY. The intervention's $ICER$ is $\\$500$ per DALY. Here, $\\$600 > \\$500$, so $\\lambda_Y > ICER$. The condition for net health gain is met. Allocating the budget to Country $Y$ would result in a net health *gain*.\n\nThis analysis demonstrates that the correct decision is to fund the intervention in Country $Y$. Misallocating the budget to Country $X$ based on the flawed GDP-per-capita rule (which suggests it is a good investment) would be a grave error, leading to a substantial decrease in population health.\n\n**3. Quantitative Difference in Net DALYs**\n\nThe final step is to compute the quantitative difference in total net DALYs between the correct allocation (to Country $Y$) and the incorrect allocation (to Country $X$). This is the difference between their net health benefits: $\\Delta H_{\\text{net, Y}} - \\Delta H_{\\text{net, X}}$.\n\nNet health benefit in Country $Y$:\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\text{net, Y}} = H - \\frac{C}{\\lambda_Y} = 20,000 - \\frac{\\$10,000,000}{\\$600}\n$$\n\nNet health benefit in Country $X$:\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\text{net, X}} = H - \\frac{C}{\\lambda_X} = 20,000 - \\frac{\\$10,000,000}{\\$150}\n$$\n\nThe difference is:\n$$\n\\text{Difference} = \\Delta H_{\\text{net, Y}} - \\Delta H_{\\text{net, X}} = \\left(20,000 - \\frac{10,000,000}{600}\\right) - \\left(20,000 - \\frac{10,000,000}{150}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Difference} = \\frac{10,000,000}{150} - \\frac{10,000,000}{600}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Difference} = 10,000,000 \\left(\\frac{1}{150} - \\frac{1}{600}\\right) = 10,000,000 \\left(\\frac{4}{600} - \\frac{1}{600}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Difference} = 10,000,000 \\left(\\frac{3}{600}\\right) = 10,000,000 \\left(\\frac{1}{200}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Difference} = 50,000 \\text{ DALYs}\n$$\nThe question requires rounding to four significant figures. The exact answer of $50,000$ can be expressed in scientific notation to meet this requirement.\n\n$50,000 = 5.000 \\times 10^4$.\nThe difference in health outcomes between the correct and incorrect allocation is $50,000$ DALYs.
