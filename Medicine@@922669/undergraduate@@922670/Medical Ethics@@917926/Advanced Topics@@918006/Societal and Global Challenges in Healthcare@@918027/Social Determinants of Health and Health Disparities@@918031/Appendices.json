It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of public health statistics and health economics, specifically concerning the measurement of health inequality using the Concentration Index (CI). The problem is well-posed, providing a clear objective and all necessary data for its resolution. The data are internally consistent and plausible within the context of socioeconomic health disparities. The task is to derive a standard formula from first principles and then apply it, which is a legitimate and formalizable scientific exercise.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the Concentration Index ($CI$) for grouped data, starting from fundamental definitions, and then its computation. The $CI$ quantifies the inequality in a health variable across the distribution of a socioeconomic variable. The standard definition of the $CI$ relates it to the covariance between the health variable, $y$, and the fractional rank of socioeconomic status, $r$. The fractional rank, $r$, ranges from $0$ for the most disadvantaged individual to $1$ for the most advantaged. The formula is:\n$$ CI = \\frac{2}{\\mu} \\text{cov}(y, r) $$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the mean of the health variable $y$.\n\nThe covariance between $y$ and $r$ is defined as:\n$$ \\text{cov}(y, r) = E[yr] - E[y]E[r] $$\nBy definition, the mean of the health variable is $\\mu = E[y]$. Substituting this into the covariance expression gives:\n$$ \\text{cov}(y, r) = E[yr] - \\mu E[r] $$\nSubstituting this back into the formula for the $CI$:\n$$ CI = \\frac{2}{\\mu} (E[yr] - \\mu E[r]) = \\frac{2}{\\mu} E[yr] - 2E[r] $$\nThis general formula must now be adapted for grouped data. The population is divided into $N$ groups, indexed $i=1, 2, \\dots, N$ from poorest to richest. For each group $i$, we are given:\n- The population share, $p_i$.\n- The average health status (hypertension prevalence), $y_i$.\n- The fractional rank, $r_i$.\n\nThe overall mean health status, $\\mu$, is the weighted average of the group-specific health statuses:\n$$ \\mu = E[y] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_i y_i $$\nSimilarly, the expectation of the product $yr$ is:\n$$ E[yr] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_i y_i r_i $$\nAnd the mean fractional rank is:\n$$ E[r] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_i r_i $$\nA key property of the fractional rank $r$, when defined as the midpoint of the cumulative population share for each group, is that its mean value is always $0.5$. We can verify this with the given data, where $N=5$ and $p_i = 0.2$ for all $i$:\n$$ E[r] = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} p_i r_i = 0.2 \\times (0.1) + 0.2 \\times (0.3) + 0.2 \\times (0.5) + 0.2 \\times (0.7) + 0.2 \\times (0.9) $$\n$$ E[r] = 0.2 \\times (0.1 + 0.3 + 0.5 + 0.7 + 0.9) = 0.2 \\times (2.5) = 0.5 $$\nSince $E[r] = 1/2$, the derived general formula for the $CI$ simplifies to a more convenient computational form:\n$$ CI = \\frac{2}{\\mu} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_i y_i r_i - 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ CI = \\frac{2}{\\mu} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_i y_i r_i - 1 $$\nThis is the required expression for the $CI$ for grouped data, derived from the first principles of expectation and covariance.\n\nWe now compute the $CI$ using the provided data for $N=5$ SES quintiles.\nGivens are:\n- $p_i = 0.2$ for $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$.\n- Prevalences: $y_1 = 0.18$, $y_2 = 0.14$, $y_3 = 0.11$, $y_4 = 0.08$, $y_5 = 0.05$.\n- Ranks: $r_1 = 0.1$, $r_2 = 0.3$, $r_3 = 0.5$, $r_4 = 0.7$, $r_5 = 0.9$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the overall mean prevalence, $\\mu$:\n$$ \\mu = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} p_i y_i = 0.2 \\times (0.18 + 0.14 + 0.11 + 0.08 + 0.05) $$\n$$ \\mu = 0.2 \\times (0.56) = 0.112 $$\nNext, we calculate the term $\\sum_{i=1}^{5} p_i y_i r_i$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{5} p_i y_i r_i = p_1 y_1 r_1 + p_2 y_2 r_2 + p_3 y_3 r_3 + p_4 y_4 r_4 + p_5 y_5 r_5 $$\nSince $p_i = 0.2$ is a common factor:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{5} p_i y_i r_i = 0.2 \\times [ (0.18)(0.1) + (0.14)(0.3) + (0.11)(0.5) + (0.08)(0.7) + (0.05)(0.9) ] $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{5} p_i y_i r_i = 0.2 \\times [ 0.018 + 0.042 + 0.055 + 0.056 + 0.045 ] $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{5} p_i y_i r_i = 0.2 \\times [ 0.216 ] = 0.0432 $$\nFinally, we substitute $\\mu$ and $\\sum p_i y_i r_i$ into our derived formula for the $CI$:\n$$ CI = \\frac{2}{\\mu} \\sum_{i=1}^{5} p_i y_i r_i - 1 $$\n$$ CI = \\frac{2}{0.112} (0.0432) - 1 $$\n$$ CI = \\frac{0.0864}{0.112} - 1 $$\nEvaluating the fraction:\n$$ \\frac{0.0864}{0.112} = \\frac{864}{1120} = \\frac{27}{35} $$\n$$ CI = \\frac{27}{35} - 1 = \\frac{27 - 35}{35} = -\\frac{8}{35} $$\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $-0.2285714...$.

The \"expected absolute number of events prevented per treated person\" is the definition of Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR).\nLet $N_A$ and $N_B$ be the number of treatment slots allocated to Group A and Group B, respectively. The policy implies:\n$N_A \\propto ARR_A$\n$N_B \\propto ARR_B$\nwhere $ARR_A$ and $ARR_B$ are the absolute risk reductions in each group due to the treatment.\n\nThe problem specifies that the treatment \"reduces individual risk by a constant relative proportion across groups\". This means the Relative Risk Reduction (RRR) is constant for both groups. Let this constant be $r$.\n$RRR = \\frac{I_{untreated} - I_{treated}}{I_{untreated}} = r$\n\nThe ARR for any group is related to its baseline incidence and the RRR:\n$ARR = I_{untreated} - I_{treated} = I_{untreated} \\times \\left( \\frac{I_{untreated} - I_{treated}}{I_{untreated}} \\right) = I_{untreated} \\times RRR$.\nThus, for our two groups:\n$ARR_A = I_A \\times r = 0.12 r$\n$ARR_B = I_B \\times r = 0.08 r$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Aligning Metric and Calculate Allocation**\n\nThe allocation of slots is proportional to the ARR for each group. The proportion of total slots, $p_A$, allocated to Group A is given by:\n$$p_A = \\frac{N_A}{N_{total}} = \\frac{ARR_A}{ARR_A + ARR_B}$$\nSubstituting our expressions for $ARR_A$ and $ARR_B$:\n$$p_A = \\frac{I_A \\times r}{I_A \\times r + I_B \\times r} = \\frac{I_A \\times r}{(I_A + I_B) \\times r} = \\frac{I_A}{I_A + I_B}$$\nThe ratio of slots allocated to Group A versus Group B is:\n$$\\frac{N_A}{N_B} = \\frac{ARR_A}{ARR_B} = \\frac{I_A \\times r}{I_B \\times r} = \\frac{I_A}{I_B}$$\nThis ratio, $\\frac{I_A}{I_B}$, is precisely the **Risk Ratio (RR)** we computed in Step 1. Therefore, under the specified treatment effect model (constant RRR) and allocation policy (proportional to ARR), the Risk Ratio is the metric that governs the relative allocation of resources between the groups.\n\nNow we can compute the number of slots to allocate to Group A, $N_A$.\nWe have the total number of slots, $N_A + N_B = 1000$.\nThe proportion of slots for Group A is:\n$$p_A = \\frac{I_A}{I_A + I_B} = \\frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.08} = \\frac{0.12}{0.20} = \\frac{12}{20} = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6$$\nThe number of slots for Group A is this proportion applied to the total number of slots:\n$$N_A = p_A \\times N_{total} = 0.6 \\times 1000 = 600$$\nThe number of slots for Group B is $N_B = N_{total} - N_A = 1000 - 600 = 400$.\nWe can check this using the ratio: $\\frac{N_A}{N_B} = \\frac{600}{400} = 1.5$, which matches the Risk Ratio $\\frac{0.12}{0.08} = 1.5$.\n\nThe final answer is the number of treatment slots allocated to Group A.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{600}\n$$", "id": "4899875"}]}
