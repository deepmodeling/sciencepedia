Theta’s Ministry of Health must choose between two policy tools within World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) flexibilities to secure access: (i) price controls, and (ii) a public-health compulsory license. The government’s public health objective is to secure at least $Q_{\\min} = 100{,}000$ complete treatment courses per year to meet clinical need, while respecting legitimate interests in continued innovation. The patentee, PharmaCo, asserts credible innovation needs: to sustain its Research and Development (R&D) pipeline, the product must contribute at least $\\Pi_{\\min} = \\$10{,}000{,}000$ in expected annual global profit. Assume the following empirically grounded inputs supplied by Theta’s health economics team:\n\n- Current monopoly price $p_0 = \\$300$, constant marginal manufacturing cost $c = \\$25$, domestic quantity at $p_0$ is $Q_0 = 40{,}000$.\n- If Theta imposes a price cap $p_{\\text{cap}} = \\$60$, market analysis predicts domestic quantity $Q_{\\text{cap}} = 120{,}000$. PharmaCo can scale to this quantity without rationing; parallel trade and external reference pricing risks are credibly mitigated by regulatory controls. PharmaCo’s profit from other markets, unaffected by Theta’s policy, is $\\Pi_{\\text{other}} = \\$7{,}000{,}000$ per year.\n- Under a compulsory license with multiple qualified generic entrants, expected domestic generics price is $p_{\\text{CL}} = \\$30$, with $Q_{\\text{CL}} = 150{,}000$.

Compulsory licensing is ethically preferred because it yields the greatest quantity; the least restrictive means principle ranks policies primarily by the absolute quantity delivered, regardless of effects on patent rights or innovation incentives.\n\nC. Neither policy is ethically permissible; any intervention that reduces the patentee’s profit below the current monopoly level $\\Pi_0$ violates the least restrictive means principle, so only non-intervention or voluntary donation is allowed.\n\nD. Both policies are ethically equivalent under least restrictive means because proportionality analysis does not consider intellectual property rights or future innovation at all, only present access.\n\nE. Price controls can only be ethically preferred if they deliver at least as much quantity as compulsory licensing and preserve the patentee’s profit exactly at $\\Pi_0$; since they deliver less quantity than compulsory licensing and reduce profit relative to $\\Pi_0$, they fail the least restrictive means test.", "solution": "The analysis will evaluate each of the two policy options against the problem's two main constraints: the public health quantity target ($Q \\ge Q_{\\min}$) and the patentee's innovation incentive needs ($\\Pi \\ge \\Pi_{\\min}$).

Since $120,000 \\ge Q_{\\min} = 100,000$, this policy **is effective** at achieving the public health aim.\n-   **Impact on Innovation (Profit):** We calculate PharmaCo's global profit under this policy.\n    -   Profit from Theta: $\\Pi_{\\text{Theta, cap}} = (p_{\\text{cap}} - c) \\times Q_{\\text{cap}} = (\\$60 - \\$25) \\times 120,000 = \\$35 \\times 120,000 = \\$4,200,000$.\n    -   Global profit: $\\Pi_{\\text{cap}} = \\Pi_{\\text{Theta, cap}} + \\Pi_{\\text{other}} = \\$4,200,000 + \\$7,000,000 = \\$11,200,000$.\n-   **Constraint Check:** We check if this profit respects the patentee's legitimate interests: $\\Pi_{\\text{cap}} = \\$11,200,000 \\ge \\Pi_{\\min} = \\$10,000,000$. This condition **is satisfied**.\n\n**2. Analysis of Policy 2: Compulsory License (CL)**\n-   **Effectiveness (Quantity):** The predicted quantity is $Q_{\\text{CL}} = 150,000$. Since $150,000 \\ge Q_{\\min} = 100,000$, this policy **is effective** at achieving the public health aim.\n-   **Impact on Innovation (Profit):** Under a CL, PharmaCo's revenue from Theta is limited to royalties on generic sales.\n    -   Total net sales by generics in Theta: $S_{\\text{CL}} = p_{\\text{CL}} \\times Q_{\\text{CL}} = \\$30 \\times 150,000 = \\$4,500,000$.\n    -   PharmaCo's royalty income from Theta: $\\Pi_{\\text{Theta, CL}} = S_{\\text{CL}} \\times r = \\$4,500,000 \\times 0.07 = \\$315,000$.\n    -   Global profit: $\\Pi_{\\text{CL}} = \\Pi_{\\text{Theta, CL}} + \\Pi_{\\text{other}} = \\$315,000 + \\$7,000,000 = \\$7,315,000$.\n-   **Constraint Check:** We check if this profit respects the patentee's legitimate interests: $\\Pi_{\\text{CL}} = \\$7,315,000 < \\Pi_{\\min} = \\$10,000,000$. This condition **is not satisfied**.\n\n**3. Application of the Least Restrictive Means (LRM) Principle**\nThe LRM principle requires selecting an **effective** measure that imposes the **smallest necessary infringement** on competing interests.\n-   The price control policy is effective (meets $Q_{\\min}$) and respects the competing interest constraint (meets $\\Pi_{\\min}$).\n-   The compulsory license policy is also effective (meets $Q_{\\min}$) but it **fails** to respect the competing interest constraint, as it drives the patentee's profit below the stated minimum required for innovation.\n-   Therefore, price controls are the only policy option presented that both achieves the public health goal and satisfies the specified constraints. It is also intrinsically a less severe infringement on the patent right itself compared to a compulsory license. Thus, it is the preferred choice under the LRM principle.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n-   **A:** This option correctly states that price controls achieve $Q_{\\min}$, maintain $\\Pi \\ge \\Pi_{\\min}$, and are less restrictive than a compulsory license. This aligns perfectly with our analysis.\n-   **B:** This misinterprets LRM as quantity maximization, which is incorrect.\n-   **C:** This incorrectly assumes any reduction from monopoly profit is impermissible.\n-   **D:** This incorrectly claims LRM ignores IP rights, which it explicitly balances.\n-   **E:** This incorrectly posits that LRM requires quantity maximization and preserving monopoly profit.\n\nThe correct choice is **A**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4879505"}]}
