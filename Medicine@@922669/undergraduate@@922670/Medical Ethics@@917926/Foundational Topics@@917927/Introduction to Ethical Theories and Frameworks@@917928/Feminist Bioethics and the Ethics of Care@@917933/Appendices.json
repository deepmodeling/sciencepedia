The nurse notices a strong affective pull toward Patient A and a muted response to Patient B, an asymmetry the nurse later recognizes may be driven by social stereotypes rather than clinical need. You are asked to analyze this case using feminist bioethics and the ethics of care, and then select the single best course of action from the options below.\n\nBackground definitions and facts:\n- Ethics of care emphasizes attentiveness, responsibility, competence, and responsiveness, prioritizing meeting actual needs through context-sensitive, relational engagement rather than abstract impartiality.\n- Feminist bioethics highlights relational autonomy, power dynamics, and the risk of stereotype-driven misrecognition and epistemic injustice, warning that empathy can mis-track true need when it follows social similarity, stereotypes, or expressive fluency rather than clinically relevant cues.\n- Standard triage practice prioritizes those with higher acuity based on physiological indicators and risk of deterioration, not on perceived deservingness, gratitude, social status, or eloquence.\n- Respiratory Rate (RR), Heart Rate (HR), Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Oxygen Saturation ($\\mathrm{SpO}_2$), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and temperature are widely used indicators of acute physiological need.\n- National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) and related Early Warning Score systems synthesize such indicators to estimate risk of clinical deterioration.\n\nCase details:\n- Patient A is a well-dressed, articulate man in his mid-$30$s whose speech and demeanor closely match the nurse’s social background. He reports severe ankle pain rated $8/10$, with RR $16$ breaths/min, HR $88$ beats/min, SBP $128$ mmHg, $\\mathrm{SpO}_2$ $98\\%$ on room air, GCS $15$, and no fever (temperature $36.8\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$).\n- Patient B is a softly spoken woman in her early $60$s with limited proficiency in the local language. She appears anxious and avoids eye contact. She reports cough and shortness of breath, with RR $28$ breaths/min, HR $110$ beats/min, SBP $94$ mmHg, $\\mathrm{SpO}_2$ $89\\%$ on room air, GCS $14$, and fever (temperature $38.6\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$).\n\nLet the empathy activation level be $E$, understood as the nurse’s felt pull to prioritize attention and resources. The nurse notes that $E$ is higher for Patient A, a pattern plausibly explained by social similarity and expressiveness rather than by clinical need.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich option most appropriately applies feminist bioethics and the ethics of care to identify the diagnostic cues that should recalibrate $E$, and proposes procedures to align affect with actual need indicators in this scenario?\n\nA. Elevate patient-reported pain as the decisive indicator because pain is central to caring practice.

Key indicators include Respiratory Rate (RR), Heart Rate (HR), Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Oxygen Saturation ($\\mathrm{SpO}_2$), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and temperature. The National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) is a tool for this purpose.\n-   **Case Data:**\n    -   **Nurse's affective response ($E$):** $E$ is higher for Patient A than for Patient B, a bias attributed to social factors.\n    -   **Patient A:** Mid-$30$s male, articulate, well-dressed. Reports severe ankle pain ($8/10$).\n        -   Vitals: RR $16$ breaths/min, HR $88$ beats/min, SBP $128$ mmHg, $\\mathrm{SpO}_2$ $98\\%$ on room air, GCS $15$, Temperature $36.8\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$.\n    -   **Patient B:** Early $60$s female, limited proficiency in the local language, anxious.

The physiological data are standard, the vital signs presented are clinically realistic for the described conditions, and the ethical frameworks (feminist bioethics, ethics of care) are recognized sub-disciplines. The NEWS2 score is a widely used and validated clinical tool. The problem is scientifically and factually sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides a clear, self-contained scenario with sufficient data to determine the clinical acuity of both patients. The question is specific, asking for the application of defined principles to derive a course of action. A unique, best-fit solution among the options can be logically determined.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem statement is objective. It describes a subjective state (the nurse's affective pull) as a premise for analysis, without endorsing it. The data and definitions are presented factually.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-constructed ethical case study that requires the integration of clinical data with specified ethical theories. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe core of the problem is the conflict between the nurse's initial, biased affective response ($E$) and the objective clinical needs of the two patients. A correct application of the given ethical frameworks must resolve this conflict in a way that is both clinically sound and ethically principled.\n\n1.  **Clinical Assessment (Standard of Care):**\n    -   **Patient A's** vital signs are all within normal limits. A NEWS2 score calculation yields:\n        -   RR ($16$): $0$ points\n        -   $\\mathrm{SpO}_2$ ($98\\%$): $0$ points\n        -   SBP ($128$): $0$ points\n        -   HR ($88$): $0$ points\n        -   GCS ($15$): $0$ points\n        -   Temperature ($36.8\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$): $0$ points\n        -   **Total NEWS2 Score: 0**. This indicates very low clinical risk. The patient is stable.\n    -   **Patient B's** vital signs are highly abnormal and indicate critical illness. A NEWS2 score calculation yields:\n        -   RR ($28$): $3$ points\n        -   $\\mathrm{SpO}_2$ ($89\\%$): $2$ points\n        -   SBP ($94$): $2$ points\n        -   HR ($110$): $1$ point\n        -   GCS ($14$, indicating new confusion): $3$ points\n        -   Temperature ($38.6\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$): $1$ point\n        -   **Total NEWS2 Score: 12**. A score $\\geq 7$ signifies high risk of deterioration and demands an urgent response. Patient B is in a physiologically critical state, likely with sepsis or severe respiratory failure.\n    -   **Conclusion:** Objective clinical data unequivocally show that Patient B has a massively higher acuity and requires immediate medical attention to prevent severe adverse outcomes.\n\n2.  **Application of Ethical Frameworks:**\n    -   **Feminist Bioethics:** This framework warns precisely against the situation described: empathy mis-tracking need due to social stereotypes. The nurse's higher empathy for Patient A is a form of \"misrecognition.\" Patient B's limited language proficiency and anxiety put her at risk for \"epistemic injustice,\" where her ability to convey the severity of her condition is compromised. An ethically correct response must actively counteract this by prioritizing objective data and taking concrete steps to overcome the communication barrier to ensure Patient B's needs are understood and met.\n    -   **Ethics of Care:** This framework demands *competent* and *responsible* action to meet needs. Simply following the initial feeling of empathy for Patient A would be incompetent and irresponsible. A true \"caring\" response involves:\n        -   *Attentiveness*: Recognizing that the initial affective pull is misleading and seeking out the true indicators of need.\n        -   *Competence*: Using clinical tools like the NEWS2 score to accurately assess the situation.\n        -   *Responsibility*: Prioritizing the patient with the life-threatening condition (Patient B).\n        -   *Responsiveness*: Engaging relationally with Patient B, using tools like language support, to overcome barriers and provide care.\n\n3.  **Synthesis:** The correct course of action must use objective physiological data as the primary driver for recalibrating the nurse's attention and priorities. It must propose a structured approach to override the initial bias and ensure care is delivered based on acuity. This involves formal scoring (NEWS2), cognitive strategies (bias interruption), and relational strategies (language support). This aligns the nurse's actions with the demands of both clinical safety and the specified ethical frameworks.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Elevate patient-reported pain as the decisive indicator because pain is central to caring practice. Instruct the nurse to mirror the affect of the most expressive patient and prioritize Patient A due to his $8/10$ pain and gratitude, while deferring Patient B until she is better able to articulate her needs.**\nThis option promotes clinical negligence. It conflates the ethics of care with uncritical emotional resonance and rewards expressive fluency, which is the exact bias feminist bioethics warns against. Deferring Patient B due to her communication barrier is a textbook example of epistemic injustice and is medically dangerous given her vital signs.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Identify objective cues of respiratory distress and hemodynamic compromise—tachypnea (RR $\\geq 24$), hypoxia ($\\mathrm{SpO}_2 < 90\\%$), hypotension (SBP $\\leq 100$ mmHg), and altered mentation (GCS $< 15$)—as the primary recalibrators of $E$. Implement a brief bias-interruption pause of $30$ seconds, apply National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) to both patients, and conduct a relational check-in with Patient B using language support to prevent epistemic injustice. Escalate care to Patient B given higher acuity while maintaining empathic follow-through for Patient A’s pain.**\nThis option is a comprehensive and correct application of all principles. It correctly identifies the objective physiological signs in Patient B as the decisive factors. It proposes concrete, evidence-based procedures to mitigate bias (a pause, NEWS2 scoring) and address relational failures (language support), which is consistent with feminist bioethics. It fulfills the ethics of care by being competent, responsible, and attentive to actual need. It correctly prioritizes Patient B while acknowledging the continuing duty of care to Patient A.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Eliminate empathy from triage to remove bias by enforcing a no-conversation rule. Rely exclusively on a fixed algorithm without any relational engagement, and if scores are similar, use first-come, first-served ordering to keep the process neutral.**\nThis option is an overcorrection that violates the core tenets of the ethics of care, which is fundamentally relational. A \"no-conversation rule\" is dehumanizing and can lead to clinical errors by missing key contextual information. While algorithms are useful, they are tools to support, not supplant, professional judgment and relational engagement. This approach is antithetical to both specified ethical frameworks.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Correct for social bias by prioritizing socially marginalized patients as a rule. Always choose Patient B over others when there are any signs of disadvantage, regardless of physiological indicators, to counteract stereotype harms in aggregate.**\nThis option replaces one form of bias with another. Triage must be based on clinical need, not social identity. Instituting a rule that ignores physiological indicators is itself unethical and clinically dangerous. The goal is to see clinical reality clearly, free from bias, not to implement a counter-bias that obscures clinical reality in a different way.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Maximize social productivity by prioritizing the patient who appears more employable and articulate. Reserve scarce staff attention for Patient A because his recovery is more likely to benefit societal output, and treat Patient B after completing the more socially valuable case.**\nThis option introduces a crude utilitarian calculus based on perceived social worth. This reasoning is explicitly discriminatory and violates the fundamental principle of equal worth and the right to care based on need, which are cornerstones of modern medical ethics. It is ethically unacceptable.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4862121"}, {"introduction": "Feminist bioethics teaches that vulnerabilities are not simply additive but intersecting and compounding.

Consider three binary indicators of structural exposure: gender minoritization $G \\in \\{0,1\\}$, racialization $Race \\in \\{0,1\\}$, and low socioeconomic class $Class \\in \\{0,1\\}$.

It uses well-defined concepts such as baseline risk ($R_0$) and relative risk ($RR$). The assumption of multiplicative effects for independent risk factors is a common and standard approach in epidemiological modeling (e.g., in Cox proportional hazards models or log-linear models). The application of these concepts to explore the quantitative implications of intersectionality, a key concept in feminist theory, is a valid and recognized area of inquiry in social epidemiology and public health ethics. The numerical values are realistic.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data ($R_0, \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$) and a clear modeling instruction (multiplicative combination of relative risks). The tasks are specific and lead to a unique solution based on the provided framework.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is objective. It defines the ethical lens to be used (feminist bioethics and EoC) and its core tenet (relational, intersecting vulnerabilities). It then asks for an analysis based on this specific framework, not for a subjective opinion. The language is precise and formal.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The solution can be derived from the provided information and principles.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\n### Mathematical Derivation and Calculation\nThe baseline risk for a reference individual ($G=0$, $Race=0$, $Class=0$) is given as $R_0 = P(\\text{outcome} \\mid G=0, Race=0, Class=0) = 0.10$.\n\nThe relative risk for a single factor $X$ is defined as $RR_X = \\frac{P(\\text{outcome} \\mid X=1, \\text{other factors}=0)}{P(\\text{outcome} \\mid X=0, \\text{other factors}=0)}$.\nFor gender minoritization, $RR_G = \\alpha = \\frac{P(\\text{outcome} \\mid G=1, Race=0, Class=0)}{R_0}$.\nFor racialization, $RR_{Race} = \\beta = \\frac{P(\\text{outcome} \\mid G=0, Race=1, Class=0)}{R_0}$.\nFor class, $RR_{Class} = \\gamma = \\frac{P(\\text{outcome} \\mid G=0, Race=0, Class=1)}{R_0}$.\n\nThe problem explicitly states to assume that the combined relative risk for co-exposed individuals is the product of the individual relative risks. This is the assumption of multiplicativity of effects. The combined relative risk, $RR_{G,Race,Class}$, for an individual with $G=1$, $Race=1$, and $Class=1$ compared to the reference individual is:\n$$RR_{G,Race,Class} = RR_G \\times RR_{Race} \\times RR_{Class} = \\alpha \\beta \\gamma$$\n\nThis combined relative risk also relates the risk $R$ for the fully exposed individual to the baseline risk $R_0$:\n$$RR_{G,Race,Class} = \\frac{P(\\text{outcome} \\mid G=1, Race=1, Class=1)}{P(\\text{outcome} \\mid G=0, Race=0, Class=0)} = \\frac{R}{R_0}$$\n\nBy equating the two expressions for the combined relative risk, we can solve for $R$:\n$$\\frac{R}{R_0} = \\alpha \\beta \\gamma$$\n$$R = R_0 \\alpha \\beta \\gamma$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values to compute $R$:\n$$R = 0.10 \\times 1.30 \\times 1.50 \\times 1.40$$\n$$R = 0.10 \\times (1.95 \\times 1.40)$$\n$$R = 0.10 \\times 2.73$$\n$$R = 0.273$$\n\nThe risk for an individual with all three structural exposures is $0.273$, or $27.3\\%$.\n\n### Ethical and Mathematical Explanation\nThe problem requires an explanation of why additive models fail to capture intersectional effects according to feminist bioethics and EoC.\n\n**Mathematical Failure of Additive Models:**\nAn additive risk model would assume that the total risk is the baseline risk plus the sum of the *excess risks* contributed by each factor.\nThe excess risk for $G=1$ is $R_0\\alpha - R_0 = R_0(\\alpha-1)$.\nThe excess risk for $Race=1$ is $R_0\\beta - R_0 = R_0(\\beta-1)$.\nThe excess risk for $Class=1$ is $R_0\\gamma - R_0 = R_0(\\gamma-1)$.\nThe additive model would predict the total risk $R_{add}$ as:\n$$R_{add} = R_0 + R_0(\\alpha-1) + R_0(\\beta-1) + R_0(\\gamma-1)$$\n$$R_{add} = 0.10 + 0.10(1.30-1) + 0.10(1.50-1) + 0.10(1.40-1)$$\n$$R_{add} = 0.10 + 0.10(0.30) + 0.10(0.50) + 0.10(0.40) = 0.10 + 0.03 + 0.05 + 0.04 = 0.22$$\nThis model is mathematically equivalent to a linear regression model on the risk scale: $R = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 G + \\beta_2 Race + \\beta_3 Class$, where there are no interaction terms (e.g., $G \\times Race$).\n\nThe multiplicative model, $R = R_0 \\alpha^G \\beta^{Race} \\gamma^{Class}$, is equivalent to a linear model on the logarithmic scale: $\\ln(R) = \\ln(R_0) + \\ln(\\alpha)G + \\ln(\\beta)Race + \\ln(\\gamma)Class$. When transformed back to the original risk scale, this model inherently contains interaction effects. For instance, the absolute risk increase associated with $G=1$ depends on the other factors.\n- If $Race=0$, the risk added by $G=1$ is $R_0\\alpha - R_0 = R_0(\\alpha-1)$.\n- If $Race=1$, the risk added by $G=1$ is $R_0\\alpha\\beta - R_0\\beta = R_0\\beta(\\alpha-1)$.\nSince $\\beta=1.50 > 1$, the absolute risk added by $G=1$ is amplified in the presence of $Race=1$. This amplification is what is meant by a multiplicative or synergistic interaction. An additive model, by its construction, cannot represent this amplification; it assumes the added risk from any one factor is constant, regardless of the presence of others.\n\n**Ethical Failure of Additive Models:**\nThe concept of intersectionality, central to feminist bioethics and EoC, posits that social identities and power structures (like gender, race, and class) are not independent and additive. They intersect to create unique experiences of oppression and privilege. An individual's vulnerability is not simply the sum of disadvantages from each marginalized identity they hold. Instead, the combination of identities results in a qualitatively different and often compounded form of vulnerability.\n-   An **additive model** mathematically represents a \"sum of oppressions\" viewpoint, treating a racialized woman from a low-income background as if her risk is simply (risk of being racialized) + (risk of being a woman) + (risk of being low-income). This fails to capture the unique, synergistic social and biological pathways through which these intersecting positions create risk.\n-   A **multiplicative model**, by including interaction terms (either explicitly or implicitly, as in this case), provides a better mathematical analogy for intersectionality. It shows how the presence of one form of structural exposure can amplify the effect of another, capturing the idea that intersecting vulnerabilities are more than the sum of their parts. It represents the \"compounding of relational vulnerabilities\" that is a core commitment of this ethical framework.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $R = R_0 \\alpha \\beta \\gamma = 0.10 \\times 1.30 \\times 1.50 \\times 1.40 = 0.273$.

This is correct, as derived above.\n-   **Ethical explanation**: This explanation is also correct. It accurately links the multiplicative model to the concept of \"compounding of relational vulnerabilities\" and correctly identifies the failure of additive models as their inability to account for interactions (cross-terms) that represent the \"intersectional amplification of risk\".\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. $R = R_0 + R_0(\\alpha - 1) + R_0(\\beta - 1) + R_0(\\gamma - 1) = 0.10 + 0.10(0.30 + 0.50 + 0.40) = 0.22$.

This part is correct.\n-   **Ethical explanation**: The explanation is internally contradictory and false. It correctly calculates the multiplicative risk but then argues against its own premise, claiming additive models are appropriate and interaction terms are ethically unnecessary. This directly contradicts the principles of intersectionality and EoC described in the problem.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, Option A is the only one that provides the correct mathematical derivation, calculation, and a sound ethical explanation consistent with the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4862118"}, {"introduction": "Ethical decision-making in medicine often requires balancing the objective authority of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) with the relational insights of the Ethics of Care.

Let the combined utility for option $i$ be defined as\n$$U^{(i)}(\\lambda) = \\lambda \\, U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(i)} + (1 - \\lambda) \\, U_{\\text{Care}}^{(i)},$$\nwhere $U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(i)}$ and $U_{\\text{Care}}^{(i)}$ are normalized to the interval $[0,1]$, and $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$ represents the decision-maker’s emphasis on Evidence-Based Medicine relative to care-centered values.\n\nStarting from the foundational principles that (a) aggregating multiple, commensurable ethical dimensions can be modeled by a convex combination on a shared scale, and (b) a recommendation “flips” at the point of indifference where the combined utilities of competing options are equal, determine the threshold weight $\\lambda^{*}$ at which the committee is indifferent between the two options and recommendations change.\n\nUse the following empirically assessed scores: $U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(1)} = 0.75$, $U_{\\text{Care}}^{(1)} = 0.65$, $U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(2)} = 0.7$, and $U_{\\text{Care}}^{(2)} = 0.8$. Provide the exact value of $\\lambda^{*}$. No rounding is required. The final answer must be a single real number.", "solution": "The problem is first subjected to a rigorous validation process to ensure its scientific and logical integrity before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem provides the following data, definitions, and conditions:\n- Two treatment options are indexed by $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$.\n- The combined utility for option $i$ is defined by the function $U^{(i)}(\\lambda) = \\lambda \\, U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(i)} + (1 - \\lambda) \\, U_{\\text{Care}}^{(i)}$.\n- The utility scores $U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(i)}$ and $U_{\\text{Care}}^{(i)}$ are normalized to the interval $[0,1]$.\n- The weighting factor $\\lambda$ is defined on the interval $[0,1]$.\n- Foundational principle (a): Aggregating commensurable ethical dimensions can be modeled by a convex combination.\n- Foundational principle (b): A recommendation change occurs at the point of indifference, where the combined utilities of competing options are equal.\n- The task is to find the threshold weight $\\lambda^{*}$ that corresponds to this point of indifference.\n- Empirically assessed scores:\n  - $U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(1)} = 0.75$\n  - $U_{\\text{Care}}^{(1)} = 0.65$\n  - $U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(2)} = 0.7$\n  - $U_{\\text{Care}}^{(2)} = 0.8$\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed for validity:\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem uses a standard mathematical model from decision theory, the weighted sum or convex combination, to represent a composite utility. This is a widely accepted method for multi-attribute utility theory. While the subject matter is medical ethics, the problem itself is a formal mathematical exercise. It does not violate any scientific or mathematical principles.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined. It provides all necessary numerical values and a precise algebraic relationship. The condition for finding the unknown variable $\\lambda^{*}$ is explicitly stated: the point of indifference where utilities are equal. As will be shown, this leads to a simple linear equation in $\\lambda^{*}$, which has a unique solution given the provided data.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. It presents a quantifiable model and asks for a mathematical derivation based on that model. Terms like \"feminist bioethics\" are used as labels for utility categories but do not introduce subjectivity into the calculation itself.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the enumerated flaws. It is self-contained, consistent, and formalizable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe problem requires finding the threshold weight $\\lambda^{*}$ at which the committee is indifferent between treatment option $1$ and treatment option $2$. According to the provided principle (b), the point of indifference is where the combined utilities of the two options are equal. Mathematically, this condition is expressed as:\n$$U^{(1)}(\\lambda^{*}) = U^{(2)}(\\lambda^{*})$$\nThe combined utility function is given as $U^{(i)}(\\lambda) = \\lambda \\, U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(i)} + (1 - \\lambda) \\, U_{\\text{Care}}^{(i)}$. Substituting this definition into the indifference equation for $i=1$ and $i=2$ yields:\n$$\\lambda^{*} U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(1)} + (1 - \\lambda^{*}) U_{\\text{Care}}^{(1)} = \\lambda^{*} U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(2)} + (1 - \\lambda^{*}) U_{\\text{Care}}^{(2)}$$\nThe objective is to solve this linear equation for $\\lambda^{*}$. We begin by expanding and rearranging the terms to isolate $\\lambda^{*}$.\n$$\\lambda^{*} U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(1)} + U_{\\text{Care}}^{(1)} - \\lambda^{*} U_{\\text{Care}}^{(1)} = \\lambda^{*} U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(2)} + U_{\\text{Care}}^{(2)} - \\lambda^{*} U_{\\text{Care}}^{(2)}$$\nNext, we group all terms containing $\\lambda^{*}$ on one side of the equation and all constant terms on the other side.\n$$\\lambda^{*} U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(1)} - \\lambda^{*} U_{\\text{Care}}^{(1)} - \\lambda^{*} U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(2)} + \\lambda^{*} U_{\\text{Care}}^{(2)} = U_{\\text{Care}}^{(2)} - U_{\\text{Care}}^{(1)}$$\nFactoring out $\\lambda^{*}$ from the left side gives:\n$$\\lambda^{*} (U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(1)} - U_{\\text{Care}}^{(1)} - U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(2)} + U_{\\text{Care}}^{(2)}) = U_{\\text{Care}}^{(2)} - U_{\\text{Care}}^{(1)}$$\nRearranging the terms inside the parentheses to group the EBM and Care utilities separately:\n$$\\lambda^{*} \\left( (U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(1)} - U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(2)}) + (U_{\\text{Care}}^{(2)} - U_{\\text{Care}}^{(1)}) \\right) = U_{\\text{Care}}^{(2)} - U_{\\text{Care}}^{(1)}$$\nFinally, we solve for $\\lambda^{*}$ by dividing both sides by the coefficient of $\\lambda^{*}$, provided this coefficient is non-zero.\n$$\\lambda^{*} = \\frac{U_{\\text{Care}}^{(2)} - U_{\\text{Care}}^{(1)}}{(U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(1)} - U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(2)}) + (U_{\\text{Care}}^{(2)} - U_{\\text{Care}}^{(1)})}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(1)} = 0.75$, $U_{\\text{Care}}^{(1)} = 0.65$, $U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(2)} = 0.7$, and $U_{\\text{Care}}^{(2)} = 0.8$.\nThe numerator is:\n$$U_{\\text{Care}}^{(2)} - U_{\\text{Care}}^{(1)} = 0.8 - 0.65 = 0.15$$\nThe terms in the denominator are:\n$$U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(1)} - U_{\\text{EBM}}^{(2)} = 0.75 - 0.7 = 0.05$$\n$$U_{\\text{Care}}^{(2)} - U_{\\text{Care}}^{(1)} = 0.8 - 0.65 = 0.15$$\nThe denominator is the sum of these two differences:\n$$(0.05) + (0.15) = 0.2$$\nSince the denominator is $0.2 \\neq 0$, a unique solution for $\\lambda^{*}$ exists. Substituting the calculated numerator and denominator values:\n$$\\lambda^{*} = \\frac{0.15}{0.2}$$\nTo express this as a simpler fraction or decimal, we can write:\n$$\\lambda^{*} = \\frac{15}{20} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$$\nThe value $\\lambda^{*} = 0.75$ lies within the defined interval $[0,1]$, confirming it is a valid weighting factor. At this weight, the utilities of the two options are equal, signifying the point of indifference for the decision-maker.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.75}$$", "id": "4862123"}]}
