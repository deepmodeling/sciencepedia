The board’s ethics committee must evaluate whether the screening test’s performance, in the context of professional self-regulation, justifies a mandatory program without additional safeguards. A validated screening tool for physician impairment has sensitivity $0.85$, specificity $0.90$, and is proposed for use in a jurisdiction where the estimated point prevalence of physician impairment is $0.02$. Using only the core definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence and fundamental probability rules, derive an expression for the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), defined as $P(\\text{Impaired} \\mid \\text{Test}^+)$, in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence, and then compute its value for the parameters above.

Your explanation should be qualitative only; the graded numeric answer for this problem is the PPV you compute.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of probability and epidemiology, specifically Bayes' theorem. It is well-posed, providing all necessary data (sensitivity, specificity, prevalence) to compute a unique and meaningful solution for the Positive Predictive Value (PPV). The language is objective and the scenario is a realistic application in medical ethics and public health policy.\n\nWe are asked to derive an expression for the Positive Predictive Value, $P(\\text{Impaired} \\mid \\text{Test}^+)$, and compute its value. Let the event of a physician being impaired be denoted by $I$, and the event of a physician not being impaired (healthy) be denoted by $H$. Let the event of a positive test result be $T^+$ and a negative test result be $T^-$.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are:\n- Prevalence of impairment, $P(I) = p = 0.02$.\n- Sensitivity of the test, $P(T^+ \\mid I) = s_{en} = 0.85$. This is the probability of a positive test given that the physician is impaired.\n- Specificity of the test, $P(T^- \\mid H) = s_{pe} = 0.90$. This is the probability of a negative test given that the physician is not impaired.\n\nThe Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is defined as the probability that a physician is truly impaired given that they have tested positive, which is the conditional probability $P(I \\mid T^+)$. We can derive an expression for this using Bayes' theorem:\n$$\nP(I \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid I) P(I)}{P(T^+)}\n$$\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T^+)$, represents the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, summing over the two mutually exclusive states: being impaired ($I$) or not being impaired ($H$).\n$$\nP(T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid I) P(I) + P(T^+ \\mid H) P(H)\n$$\nWe are given $P(T^+ \\mid I) = s_{en}$ and $P(I) = p$. We can derive the remaining terms. The probability of not being impaired is the complement of the prevalence:\n$$\nP(H) = 1 - P(I) = 1 - p\n$$\nThe probability of a positive test in a non-impaired individual, $P(T^+ \\mid H)$, is the false positive rate. This is the complement of the specificity, $s_{pe} = P(T^- \\mid H)$:\n$$\nP(T^+ \\mid H) = 1 - P(T^- \\mid H) = 1 - s_{pe}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(T^+)$:\n$$\nP(T^+) = (s_{en} \\cdot p) + ((1 - s_{pe}) \\cdot (1 - p))\n$$\nNow we can substitute this complete expression for $P(T^+)$ back into the Bayes' theorem formula for the PPV:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = P(I \\mid T^+) = \\frac{s_{en} \\cdot p}{s_{en} \\cdot p + (1 - s_{pe}) \\cdot (1 - p)}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the Positive Predictive Value in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value using the provided parameters:\n- $p = 0.02$\n- $s_{en} = 0.85$\n- $s_{pe} = 0.90$\n\nThe probability of a non-impaired physician is $P(H) = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98$.\nThe false positive rate is $P(T^+ \\mid H) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n\nThe numerator of the PPV expression is the probability of a true positive result in the population:\n$$\nP(T^+ \\cap I) = P(T^+ \\mid I) P(I) = s_{en} \\cdot p = 0.85 \\times 0.02 = 0.017\n$$\nThe denominator is the total probability of a positive test, which is the sum of true positives and false positives:\n$$\nP(T^+) = (s_{en} \\cdot p) + ((1 - s_{pe}) \\cdot (1 - p)) = (0.85 \\times 0.02) + ((1 - 0.90) \\times (1 - 0.02))\n$$\n$$\nP(T^+) = 0.017 + (0.10 \\times 0.98) = 0.017 + 0.098 = 0.115\n$$\nFinally, we compute the PPV:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.017}{0.115} \\approx 0.147826...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the PPV is $0.1478$.\n\nThe computed Positive Predictive Value of approximately $0.1478$ means that among all physicians who test positive with this screening tool, only about $14.8\\%$ are actually impaired. The remaining $85.2\\%$ ($1 - 0.1478 = 0.8522$) are false positives—they are not impaired but have been flagged by the test. This extremely low PPV is a direct consequence of applying a test, even one with decent sensitivity and specificity, to a population with a low prevalence of the condition.\n\nIn the context of professional self-regulation and patient protection, this result has profound ethical implications for a mandatory screening policy. A policy that relies solely on this test would generate a large number of false positives. For every one truly impaired physician correctly identified by a positive test, roughly six non-impaired physicians would also be flagged ($0.8522 / 0.1478 \\approx 5.76$). This matters ethically because a positive test, even if preliminary, can trigger investigations, temporary suspension, and significant psychological distress, reputational damage, and financial cost for the physician. Subjecting a large number of non-impaired professionals to such a harmful process based on a highly probable false alarm raises serious questions about fairness, due process, and the principle of non-maleficence (first, do no harm). The goal of patient protection is paramount, but the logic of professional self-regulation requires methods that are not only effective but also just and proportionate. A high false-positive rate undermines the legitimacy of the regulatory process and can erode trust within the profession. Therefore, this computed PPV strongly implies that such a screening test, if mandated, cannot be used as a standalone diagnostic or disciplinary tool. It must be part of a carefully designed multi-stage system with immediate, confidential access to highly accurate confirmatory testing to rapidly clear the vast majority who test positive falsely, thereby mitigating the severe ethical harms.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1478}$$", "id": "4866081"}, {"introduction": "Beyond automated tests, professional self-regulation often relies on the expert judgment of peers.
