This allows for a fair comparison of mortality between districts, free from the confounding effect of differing age distributions.\n\nLet $i$ be the index for the age band, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\nLet $j$ be the index for the district.\nThe age-specific mortality rate for age band $i$ in district $j$ is given as $r_{ij}$, expressed in deaths per $K$ persons, where $K=1000$. This means that the mortality rate as a simple proportion, let's call it $m_{ij}$, is given by $m_{ij} = \\frac{r_{ij}}{K}$.\n\nThe standard population has a known count of individuals, $S_i$, in each age band $i$. The total size of the standard population is $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} S_i$.\n\nTo find the DASR for district $j$, we calculate the total number of deaths that would be *expected* to occur in the standard population if it were subject to the age-specific mortality rates of district $j$.\n\nThe number of expected deaths in age band $i$, denoted $E_{ij}$, is the product of the number of people in that age band in the standard population ($S_i$) and the age-specific mortality proportion for district $j$ ($m_{ij}$):\n$$E_{ij} = S_i \\times m_{ij} = S_i \\times \\frac{r_{ij}}{K}$$\n\nThe total number of expected deaths for district $j$, denoted $E_j$, is the sum of the expected deaths across all age bands:\n$$E_j = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} E_{ij} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left(S_i \\times \\frac{r_{ij}}{K}\\right) = \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} S_i r_{ij}$$\n\nThe DASR is the total number of expected deaths per person in the standard population, typically scaled to be expressed per $K$ persons to maintain consistency with the input rates.\n$$\\mathrm{DASR}_j = \\frac{E_j}{S} \\times K$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E_j$:\n$$\\mathrm{DASR}_j = \\frac{\\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} S_i r_{ij}}{S} \\times K$$\nThe factors of $K$ cancel, yielding the general expression for the DASR for district $j$:\n$$\\mathrm{DASR}_j = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} S_i r_{ij}}{S}$$\nThis can also be expressed as a weighted average of the age-specific rates, where the weights $w_i = \\frac{S_i}{S}$ are the proportions of the standard population in each age band:\n$$\\mathrm{DASR}_j = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left(\\frac{S_i}{S}\\right) r_{ij} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i r_{ij}$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation for Districts A and B**\n\nWe are given the following data:\nStandard population counts: $S_1 = 28000$, $S_2 = 62000$, $S_3 = 10000$.\nTotal standard population: $S = 28000 + 62000 + 10000 = 100000$.\nThe rates are per $K=1000$ persons.\n\nDistrict A rates: $r_{1A} = 2.5$, $r_{2A} = 6.0$, $r_{3A} = 45.0$.\nDistrict B rates: $r_{1B} = 3.0$, $r_{2B} = 5.5$, $r_{3B} = 40.0$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the DASR for District A ($\\mathrm{DASR}_A$):\n$$\\mathrm{DASR}_A = \\frac{S_1 r_{1A} + S_2 r_{2A} + S_3 r_{3A}}{S}$$\n$$\\mathrm{DASR}_A = \\frac{(28000 \\times 2.5) + (62000 \\times 6.0) + (10000 \\times 45.0)}{100000}$$\n$$\\mathrm{DASR}_A = \\frac{70000 + 372000 + 450000}{100000}$$\n$$\\mathrm{DASR}_A = \\frac{892000}{100000} = 8.92$$\nThe units of $\\mathrm{DASR}_A$ are deaths per $1000$ persons.\n\nNext, we calculate the DASR for District B ($\\mathrm{DASR}_B$):\n$$\\mathrm{DASR}_B = \\frac{S_1 r_{1B} + S_2 r_{2B} + S_3 r_{3B}}{S}$$\n$$\\mathrm{DASR}_B = \\frac{(28000 \\times 3.0) + (62000 \\times 5.5) + (10000 \\times 40.0)}{100000}$$\n$$\\mathrm{DASR}_B = \\frac{84000 + 341000 + 400000}{100000}$$\n$$\\mathrm{DASR}_B = \\frac{825000}{100000} = 8.25$$\nThe units of $\\mathrm{DASR}_B$ are also deaths per $1000$ persons.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of the Standardized Rate Ratio (SRR)**\n\nThe SRR is defined as the ratio of the two standardized rates:\n$$\\mathrm{SRR} = \\frac{\\mathrm{DASR}_A}{\\mathrm{DASR}_B}$$\n$$\\mathrm{SRR} = \\frac{8.92}{8.25} \\approx 1.08121212...$$\nThe problem requires rounding the result to four significant figures.

The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe problem asks for three distinct calculations and interpretations.\n\n**1. Aggregated Cholera Incidence**\n\nFirst, we pool the data across all three wards to compute the overall incidence rates for sewered and non-sewered populations.\n\nThe total population of sewered residents is:\n$$N_S = N_{1,S} + N_{2,S} + N_{3,S} = 3000 + 2000 + 500 = 5500$$\nThe total number of cholera cases among sewered residents is:\n$$C_S = C_{1,S} + C_{2,S} + C_{3,S} = 270 + 80 + 5 = 355$$\nThe aggregated cholera incidence among sewered residents is:\n$$I_S = \\frac{C_S}{N_S} = \\frac{355}{5500} = \\frac{71}{1100} \\approx 0.0645$$\n\nThe total population of non-sewered residents is:\n$$N_{\\neg S} = N_{1,\\neg S} + N_{2,\\neg S} + N_{3,\\neg S} = 1000 + 3000 + 4000 = 8000$$\nThe total number of cholera cases among non-sewered residents is:\n$$C_{\\neg S} = C_{1,\\neg S} + C_{2,\\neg S} + C_{3,\\neg S} = 120 + 180 + 80 = 380$$\nThe aggregated cholera incidence among non-sewered residents is:\n$$I_{\\neg S} = \\frac{C_{\\neg S}}{N_{\\neg S}} = \\frac{380}{8000} = \\frac{19}{400} = 0.0475$$\n\n**Interpretation of Aggregated Data:**\nComparing the two rates, we find $I_S \\approx 0.0645 > I_{\\neg S} = 0.0475$. The aggregated data misleadingly suggest that having a sewer connection is associated with a *higher* risk of cholera.\n\n**2. Ward-Stratified Incidences**\n\nNext, we compute the incidence rates within each ward (stratum).\n\n**Ward 1:**\n- Sewered incidence: $I_{S|W=1} = \\frac{C_{1,S}}{N_{1,S}} = \\frac{270}{3000} = 0.09$.\n- Non-sewered incidence: $I_{\\neg S|W=1} = \\frac{C_{1,\\neg S}}{N_{1,\\neg S}} = \\frac{120}{1000} = 0.12$.\n- In Ward $1$, $I_{S|W=1} < I_{\\neg S|W=1}$.\n\n**Ward 2:**\n- Sewered incidence: $I_{S|W=2} = \\frac{C_{2,S}}{N_{2,S}} = \\frac{80}{2000} = 0.04$.\n- Non-sewered incidence: $I_{\\neg S|W=2} = \\frac{C_{2,\\neg S}}{N_{2,\\neg S}} = \\frac{180}{3000} = 0.06$.\n- In Ward $2$, $I_{S|W=2} < I_{\\neg S|W=2}$.\n\n**Ward 3:**\n- Sewered incidence: $I_{S|W=3} = \\frac{C_{3,S}}{N_{3,S}} = \\frac{5}{500} = 0.01$.\n- Non-sewered incidence: $I_{\\neg S|W=3} = \\frac{C_{3,\\neg S}}{N_{3,\\neg S}} = \\frac{80}{4000} = 0.02$.\n- In Ward $3$, $I_{S|W=3} < I_{\\neg S|W=3}$.\n\n**Interpretation of Stratified Data:**\nIn every single ward, the cholera incidence is lower for sewered residents than for non-sewered residents. This directly contradicts the conclusion from the aggregated data. This reversal of association is the defining characteristic of Simpson's paradox.\n\n**3. Reconciliation via Conditioning and Standardization**\n\nThe paradox arises because the confounding variable—ward membership, which serves as a proxy for baseline risk—is correlated with both the exposure (sewerage) and the outcome (cholera). Specifically, the distribution of the population across wards is different for the sewered and non-sewered groups.\n\nLet's examine the distributions:\n- Proportion of sewered residents in high-risk Ward 1: $3000/5500 \\approx 54.5\\%$.\n- Proportion of sewered residents in low-risk Ward 3: $500/5500 \\approx 9.1\\%$.\n- Proportion of non-sewered residents in high-risk Ward 1: $1000/8000 = 12.5\\%$.\n- Proportion of non-sewered residents in low-risk Ward 3: $4000/8000 = 50\\%$.\n\nThe sewered population is concentrated in the highest-risk ward, while the non-sewered population is concentrated in the lowest-risk ward. The aggregated rate for the sewered group is thus inflated by the high baseline risk of Ward $1$, while the aggregated rate for the non-sewered group is deflated by the low baseline risk of Ward $3$.\n\nTo resolve this, we perform direct standardization, creating adjusted incidence rates by applying the stratum-specific rates to a standard population distribution. The problem specifies using the city's overall ward distribution as the standard.\n\nFirst, calculate the standard weights ($w_i$):\n- Total population of Ward 1: $N_1 = 3000 + 1000 = 4000$.\n- Total population of Ward 2: $N_2 = 2000 + 3000 = 5000$.\n- Total population of Ward 3: $N_3 = 500 + 4000 = 4500$.\n- Total city population: $N = N_1 + N_2 + N_3 = 4000 + 5000 + 4500 = 13500$.\n- Standard weights:\n  - $w_1 = N_1/N = 4000/13500 = 8/27$.\n  - $w_2 = N_2/N = 5000/13500 = 10/27$.\n  - $w_3 = N_3/N = 4500/13500 = 9/27$.\n\nNow, compute the standardized incidences ($I_{std}$) by taking the weighted average of the stratum-specific rates.\n\nStandardized incidence for sewered residents:\n$$I_{S, std} = \\sum_{w=1}^3 w_w I_{S|W=w} = w_1 I_{S|W=1} + w_2 I_{S|W=2} + w_3 I_{S|W=3}$$\n$$I_{S, std} = \\left(\\frac{8}{27}\\right) (0.09) + \\left(\\frac{10}{27}\\right) (0.04) + \\left(\\frac{9}{27}\\right) (0.01)$$\n$$I_{S, std} = \\frac{1}{27} (8 \\times 0.09 + 10 \\times 0.04 + 9 \\times 0.01) = \\frac{1}{27} (0.72 + 0.40 + 0.09) = \\frac{1.21}{27} \\approx 0.04481$$\n\nStandardized incidence for non-sewered residents:\n$$I_{\\neg S, std} = \\sum_{w=1}^3 w_w I_{\\neg S|W=w} = w_1 I_{\\neg S|W=1} + w_2 I_{\\neg S|W=2} + w_3 I_{\\neg S|W=3}$$\n$$I_{\\neg S, std} = \\left(\\frac{8}{27}\\right) (0.12) + \\left(\\frac{10}{27}\\right) (0.06) + \\left(\\frac{9}{27}\\right) (0.02)$$\n$$I_{\\neg S, std} = \\frac{1}{27} (8 \\times 0.12 + 10 \\times 0.06 + 9 \\times 0.02) = \\frac{1}{27} (0.96 + 0.60 + 0.18) = \\frac{1.74}{27} \\approx 0.06444$$\n\n**Interpretation of Standardized Data:**\nAfter adjusting for the confounding effect of ward distribution, the standardized incidence for sewered residents ($I_{S, std} \\approx 0.0448$) is clearly lower than that for non-sewered residents ($I_{\\neg S, std} \\approx 0.0644$). This confirms the finding from the stratified analysis: sewers have a protective effect.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Aggregation shows that sewered residents have a lower cholera incidence than non-sewered residents, so sewers are uniformly protective; stratification is unnecessary.**\nThis is factually incorrect. The aggregated incidence for sewered residents ($I_S \\approx 0.0645$) is higher than for non-sewered residents ($I_{\\neg S} = 0.0475$). Furthermore, the claim that stratification is unnecessary is a misunderstanding of confounding.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Aggregation misleadingly shows higher cholera incidence among sewered residents, but stratification by ward reveals lower incidence among sewered residents in every ward; the paradox arises because sewered residents are disproportionately in the highest-risk ward. Direct standardization to the city’s combined ward distribution yields a standardized sewered incidence of approximately $0.0448$ and a standardized non-sewered incidence of approximately $0.0644$, correctly indicating a protective effect of sewers.**\nThis statement accurately reflects the results of the derivation. It correctly identifies the direction of the aggregated relationship ($I_S > I_{\\neg S}$), the direction of the stratified relationship ($I_{S|W} < I_{\\neg S|W}$ for all wards), the correct mechanism for the paradox (confounding by ward risk), and the correct numerical results for direct standardization ($I_{S, std} \\approx 0.0448$ and $I_{\\neg S, std} \\approx 0.0644$), along with the correct final interpretation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Simpson’s paradox is caused by using incidence per $100$ residents rather than per $1000$, and unit conversion alone resolves the contradiction without stratification; standardized incidences for sewered and non-sewered residents are equal.**\nThis is conceptually flawed. Changing the units of an incidence rate (e.g., from per capita to per $1000$) is a simple multiplicative scaling that does not alter the direction of an inequality and cannot resolve Simpson's paradox. The claim that standardized incidences are equal is also numerically false, as shown by the calculations.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Conditioning on ward does not change the conclusion because sewer placement was random; aggregated differences are causal and persist after standardization, showing sewers increased cholera risk.**\nThis statement contains multiple errors. Conditioning on ward fundamentally *reverses* the conclusion. Sewer placement was demonstrably non-random, as shown by the unequal distributions. The aggregated differences are not causal but are artifacts of confounding, and the standardized results show a protective effect, not an increased risk.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4778690"}, {"introduction": "The success of the sanitary movement depended not only on statistical insight but also on engineering prowess.

In uniform flow, the depth and velocity are constant along the channel, which implies that the water surface is parallel to the channel bed. Consequently, the component of gravity driving the flow is exactly balanced by the frictional resistance from the channel boundary.\n\n1.  **Gravitational Force**: The gravitational force component acting in the direction of flow, $F_g$, is given by the weight of the fluid in the control volume, $W$, multiplied by the sine of the bed angle, $\\alpha$.\n    $$F_g = W \\sin\\alpha$$\n    The weight of the fluid is $W = \\rho g V_{\\text{vol}} = \\rho g A L$, where $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $A$ is the cross-sectional flow area, and $L$ is the length of the channel segment.\n    For the small angles typical of open channels, the slope of the bed, $S$, can be approximated as $S = \\tan\\alpha \\approx \\sin\\alpha$. Thus, the driving force is:\n    $$F_g = \\rho g A L S$$\n\n2.  **Frictional Resistance Force**: The resisting force, $F_f$, is the product of the average boundary shear stress, $\\tau_0$, and the wetted surface area, which is the wetted perimeter, $P$, multiplied by the length, $L$.\n    $$F_f = \\tau_0 P L$$\n\n3.  **Force Balance**: Under steady, uniform flow, $F_g = F_f$.\n    $$\\rho g A L S = \\tau_0 P L$$\n    Solving for the average shear stress yields a fundamental relationship for uniform flow:\n    $$\\tau_0 = \\rho g \\frac{A}{P} S$$\n    The term $A/P$ is the hydraulic radius, denoted by $R_h$. The equation becomes:\n    $$\\tau_0 = \\rho g R_h S$$\n\n4.  **Empirical Velocity Relation**: The next step is to relate the shear stress $\\tau_0$ to the mean flow velocity $V$. Based on extensive empirical work tracing back to Antoine de Chézy and later refined by Robert Manning and others, the mean velocity was found to follow a relationship of the form $V = C \\sqrt{R_h S}$, known as the Chézy equation. This implies that $\\tau_0$ is proportional to $V^2$. The key contribution of Manning and his contemporary Gauckler was to provide an empirical expression for the Chézy coefficient, $C$, showing it was not a constant but depended on the hydraulic radius and boundary roughness. Their data suggested $C \\propto R_h^{1/6}$.\n\n    In SI units, this relationship is expressed as $C = \\frac{1}{n} R_h^{1/6}$, where $n$ is the Manning roughness coefficient, an empirical constant that depends on the boundary material.\n\n5.  **Final Equation**: Substituting this expression for $C$ into the Chézy equation gives the Manning equation:\n    $$V = \\left(\\frac{1}{n} R_h^{1/6}\\right) \\sqrt{R_h S} = \\frac{1}{n} R_h^{1/6} R_h^{1/2} S^{1/2}$$\n    Combining the exponents for $R_h$ ($1/6 + 1/2 = 1/6 + 3/6 = 4/6 = 2/3$):\n    $$V = \\frac{1}{n} R_h^{2/3} S^{1/2}$$\n    This is the Manning equation for mean velocity in uniform open-channel flow.\n\n### Part 2: Geometric Properties of a Partially Full Circular Sewer\n\nFor a circular sewer of diameter $D$ and radius $r=D/2$ flowing at a depth $y$, we define $\\theta$ as the half-central angle subtended by the wetted arc. All angular quantities must be in radians.\n\nFrom the geometry of a circular cross-section with its center at the origin, the relationship between the flow depth $y$ and the angle $\\theta$ is given by:\n$$y = r(1 - \\cos\\theta)$$\nThis can be rearranged to express $\\cos\\theta$ in terms of the given ratio $y/D$:\n$$\\cos\\theta = 1 - \\frac{y}{r} = 1 - \\frac{2y}{D}$$\nFor the given condition $y = 0.80 D$, we have:\n$$\\cos\\theta = 1 - 2(0.80) = 1 - 1.60 = -0.60$$\nSince $y > r$, the angle $\\theta$ is in the second quadrant. The value of $\\theta$ is:\n$$\\theta = \\arccos(-0.60) \\approx 2.2143\\,\\text{rad}$$\n\nThe cross-sectional area of flow, $A$, and the wetted perimeter, $P$, are given by the geometry of the circular segment:\nThe area $A$ is the area of the circular sector defined by the angle $2\\theta$ adjusted by the area of the central triangle. The general formula valid for any depth is:\n$$A = r^2(\\theta - \\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta)$$\nUsing $\\sin\\theta = \\sqrt{1-\\cos^2\\theta} = \\sqrt{1 - (-0.60)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.36} = \\sqrt{0.64} = 0.80$ (positive since $\\theta$ is in the second quadrant), the area is:\n$$A = r^2(2.2143 - (0.80)(-0.60)) = r^2(2.2143 + 0.48) = 2.6943 r^2$$\n\nThe wetted perimeter, $P$, is the length of the wetted arc:\n$$P = 2r\\theta = 2r(2.2143) = 4.4286 r$$\n\n### Part 3: Sizing the Sewer Diameter\n\nThe design discharge, $Q_p$, is related to velocity and area by the continuity equation, $Q_p = VA$. Substituting the Manning equation for $V$:\n$$Q_p = \\left(\\frac{1}{n} R_h^{2/3} S^{1/2}\\right) A = \\frac{S^{1/2}}{n} A R_h^{2/3}$$\nWe first express the hydraulic radius $R_h$ in terms of $r$:\n$$R_h = \\frac{A}{P} = \\frac{2.6943 r^2}{4.4286 r} \\approx 0.60838 r$$\nNow, substitute the expressions for $A$ and $R_h$ into the discharge equation:\n$$Q_p = \\frac{S^{1/2}}{n} (2.6943 r^2) (0.60838 r)^{2/3}$$\nThe term $(0.60838)^{2/3} \\approx 0.72034$. The equation becomes:\n$$Q_p = \\frac{S^{1/2}}{n} (2.6943 r^2) (0.72034 r^{2/3})$$\nCombine the terms involving $r$:\n$$Q_p = \\frac{S^{1/2}}{n} (2.6943 \\times 0.72034) r^{2 + 2/3} = \\frac{S^{1/2}}{n} (1.9408) r^{8/3}$$\nNow, we solve for the radius $r$.\n$$r^{8/3} = \\frac{n Q_p}{S^{1/2} \\times 1.9408}$$\nSubstitute the given values: $Q_p = 2.50\\,\\mathrm{m^{3}\\,s^{-1}}$, $n = 0.013$, and $S = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n$$S^{1/2} = \\sqrt{1.5 \\times 10^{-3}} \\approx 0.0387298$$\n$$r^{8/3} = \\frac{0.013 \\times 2.50}{0.0387298 \\times 1.9408} = \\frac{0.0325}{0.075185} \\approx 0.43226$$\nTo find $r$, we raise this value to the power of $3/8$:\n$$r = (0.43226)^{3/8} \\approx 0.7282\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nThe diameter $D$ is twice the radius:\n$$D = 2r = 2 \\times 0.7282\\,\\mathrm{m} \\approx 1.4564\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nRounding to three significant figures as required, the final diameter is $1.46\\,\\mathrm{m}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.46}$$", "id": "4778702"}]}
