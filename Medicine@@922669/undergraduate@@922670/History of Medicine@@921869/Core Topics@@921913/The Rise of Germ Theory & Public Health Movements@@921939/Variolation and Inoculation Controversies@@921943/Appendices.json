[@problem_id:4782973]", "problem": "In the early eighteenth-century Boston smallpox epidemic, variolation (deliberate inoculation with smallpox matter) was introduced under controversy. To reason from first principles in epidemiology, recall the core definitions: for a cohort, the risk of death is $R = d/n$, where $d$ is the number of deaths and $n$ is the number of infected persons at risk; the crude relative risk is $RR_{\\text{crude}} = R_{\\text{exposed}}/R_{\\text{unexposed}}$. Confounding by indication arises when treatment assignment is related to baseline risk, so that $RR_{\\text{crude}}$ may not reflect the causal contrast that would be observed under exchangeable groups.\n\nSuppose a historian compiles the following plausibly representative counts from Boston: among variolated individuals, there were $6$ deaths in $247$ inoculations; among naturally infected individuals, there were $844$ deaths in $5{,}889$ infections. To examine confounding by indication, further suppose that exposure status was unequally distributed across two strata reflecting baseline severity: high-exposure households (stratum $H$) and low-exposure households (stratum $L$). In the variolated cohort, stratum $H$ had $120$ individuals with $5$ deaths and stratum $L$ had $127$ individuals with $1$ death. In the natural-infection cohort, stratum $H$ had $1{,}200$ individuals with $300$ deaths and stratum $L$ had $4{,}689$ individuals with $544$ deaths.\n\nUsing only these core definitions and well-tested cohort aggregation principles, do the following:\n- Compute the crude relative risk $RR_{\\text{crude}}$ from the aggregate counts.\n- Compute a stratum-adjusted relative risk $RR_{\\text{adj}}$ by applying the Mantel-Haenszel (MH) standardization principle for risk ratios over strata $H$ and $L$.\n- Define the confounding bias factor $B$ as $B = RR_{\\text{crude}}/RR_{\\text{adj}}$ and compute $B$.\n\nReport the single value of $B$ rounded to four significant figures.

The sum of individuals and deaths in the strata correctly aggregates to the total counts for both the variolated and natural-infection groups. For the variolated group, $120 + 127 = 247$ and $5 + 1 = 6$. for the natural-infection group, $1{,}200 + 4{,}689 = 5{,}889$ and $300 + 544 = 844$. The problem is scientifically grounded, using standard epidemiological definitions and principles (risk, relative risk, Mantel-Haenszel standardization). It is well-posed, objective, and requires a specific, verifiable calculation. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nLet the variolated group be the exposed group, denoted by subscript $E$, and the naturally infected group be the unexposed group, denoted by subscript $U$.

[@problem_id:4783020]", "problem": "In the eighteenth century, variolation against smallpox introduced a small, deliberate chance of death in exchange for immunity, while doing nothing left one exposed to a possibly lower chance of encountering smallpox at all but with a higher fatality rate if infected. Let an individual’s lifetime well-being be represented by wealth $w$ and a von Neumann–Morgenstern (VNM) expected utility function $U(w)$ that is strictly increasing and concave, reflecting risk aversion. Death is modeled as $w=0$ with utility $U(0)=0$. Consider the following historically plausible stylized setting to anchor intuition:\n- Baseline wealth $w_0=100$.\n- Variolation imposes a certain cost $c=15$ on survivors and an immediate mortality risk $q=0.015$.\n- Doing nothing leaves a probability $p=0.10$ of contracting smallpox at some point; if infected, the case-fatality risk is $r=0.20$, and survivors of infection incur a morbidity cost $m=50$ (lost productivity, scarring, care costs). With probability $1-p$, the individual is never infected and bears no cost.\nIt is known that expected mortality under variolation, $q$, can be lower than expected mortality under natural exposure, $pr$. In this setup, indeed $q=0.015<pr=0.020$.\n\nUsing only the first principles of VNM expected utility maximization and the definition that concavity of $U$ encodes risk aversion (together with the historically plausible numerical illustration above), which option best explains why a risk-averse individual might rationally oppose variolation even when expected mortality is lower than under natural exposure?\n\nA) Because risk-averse decision-makers maximize expected wealth rather than expected utility, lower expected mortality ($q<pr$) implies lower expected wealth after variolation, so variolation must be worse.\n\nB) Because with concave $U$, the certain loss $c$ imposed on all survivors by variolation and its immediate mortality risk $q$ can reduce expected utility below that of waiting, which preserves a chance $(1-p)$ of no loss at all; formally, it can occur that $(1-q)U(w_0-c)+q\\,U(0)<(1-p)U(w_0)+p\\big[(1-r)U(w_0-m)+r\\,U(0)\\big]$ even when $q<pr$.\n\nC) Because risk-averse individuals always prefer the option with lower variance regardless of costs, variolation is never opposed when its mortality risk is lower.\n\nD) Because concavity of $U$ implies $E[U(W)]=U(E[W])$, only expected wealth matters; hence if expected mortality is lower, variolation must be preferred and cannot be opposed.", "solution": "### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem statement provides the following information:\n-   An individual's well-being is represented by wealth, $w$.\n-   The individual has a von Neumann–Morgenstern (VNM) expected utility function, $U(w)$.\n-   The utility function is strictly increasing, $U'(w) > 0$.\n-   The utility function is strictly concave, $U''(w) < 0$, which models risk aversion.\n-   Death corresponds to a wealth level of $w=0$, with an associated utility of $U(0)=0$.\n-   A stylized numerical setting is provided for intuition:\n    -   Baseline wealth, $w_0 = 100$.\n    -   **Variolation option**:\n        -   Certain cost if one survives: $c = 15$.\n        -   Immediate mortality risk: $q = 0.015$.\n    -   **Doing nothing (natural exposure) option**:\n        -   Probability of contracting smallpox: $p = 0.10$.\n        -   Case-fatality risk if infected: $r = 0.20$.\n        -   Morbidity cost if one survives infection: $m = 50$.\n        -   Probability of never being infected: $1-p$.\n-   It is given that the expected mortality under variolation is lower than under natural exposure: $q = 0.015 < pr = (0.10)(0.20) = 0.020$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement must be validated for scientific soundness, clarity, and consistency.\n\n1.  **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is firmly grounded in the principles of expected utility theory, a cornerstone of microeconomic theory and decision theory developed by von Neumann and Morgenstern. The application to the historical medical dilemma of variolation is a classic and appropriate example for illustrating the concepts of risk, risk aversion, and rational choice under uncertainty. The model is a simplification, as acknowledged (\"stylized setting\"), but it is a standard and valid approach for this type of analysis.\n\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for an explanation of a phenomenon (rational opposition to variolation) within a clearly defined theoretical framework (VNM expected utility) and with a complete set of parameters for a numerical illustration. The question is structured to have a unique conceptual answer derived from the theory.\n\n3.  **Objectivity and Clarity**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and unambiguous terminology from economics and mathematics (e.g., \"von Neumann–Morgenstern (VNM) expected utility function\", \"strictly increasing and concave\", \"mortality risk\"). There are no subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\n4.  **Consistency**: The data provided are internally consistent. The statement that $q < pr$ is explicitly checked with the given numbers ($0.015 < 0.020$), confirming the premise of the question. All necessary information to construct the expected utility for both choices is provided.\n\nThe problem statement does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, internally consistent, and formalizable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe core principle is that a rational individual, according to the VNM framework, chooses the option that maximizes their expected utility. We must formalize the expected utility of the two choices: variolation (V) and doing nothing/natural exposure (N).\n\n**Expected Utility of Variolation ($EU_V$)**\nAn individual who chooses variolation faces a lottery with two outcomes:\n1.  Survival, with probability $(1-q)$: Wealth becomes $w_0 - c$, and utility is $U(w_0 - c)$.\n2.  Death, with probability $q$: Wealth becomes $0$, and utility is $U(0)$.\n\nGiven that $U(0)=0$, the expected utility is:\n$$EU_V = (1-q)U(w_0 - c) + qU(0) = (1-q)U(w_0 - c)$$\n\n**Expected Utility of Doing Nothing ($EU_N$)**\nAn individual who does nothing faces a more complex lottery:\n1.  With probability $(1-p)$, the individual is never infected. Wealth remains $w_0$, and utility is $U(w_0)$.\n2.  With probability $p$, the individual contracts smallpox. This leads to a secondary lottery:\n    a. Survival, with probability $(1-r)$: Wealth becomes $w_0 - m$, and utility is $U(w_0 - m)$.\n    b. Death, with probability $r$: Wealth becomes $0$, and utility is $U(0)$.\n\nThe expected utility of this combined lottery is:\n$$EU_N = (1-p)U(w_0) + p \\left[ (1-r)U(w_0 - m) + rU(0) \\right]$$\nGiven that $U(0)=0$, this simplifies to:\n$$EU_N = (1-p)U(w_0) + p(1-r)U(w_0 - m)$$\n\n**Condition for Opposing Variolation**\nA rational, risk-averse individual would oppose variolation if the expected utility of doing so is lower than the expected utility of doing nothing:\n$$EU_V < EU_N$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions:\n$$(1-q)U(w_0 - c) < (1-p)U(w_0) + p(1-r)U(w_0 - m)$$\nThe question is to explain why this inequality can hold even when $q < pr$. The reason lies in the nature of risk aversion, which is captured by the concavity of $U(w)$. A concave function implies diminishing marginal utility of wealth.\n\nThe variolation option forces a *certain* (if one survives) but relatively small wealth reduction of $c$. The utility of the surviving state is $U(w_0-c)$. The \"doing nothing\" option offers a large probability, $(1-p)$, of the best possible outcome: no loss of wealth and utility $U(w_0)$. This \"upside\" of maintaining full wealth is highly attractive. The downside of natural exposure is a small overall probability, $p$, of a bad outcome, which itself is split between a very bad outcome (death) and a bad outcome (survival with a large cost $m$).\n\nBecause $U(w)$ is concave, the utility loss from the certain cost $c$ in the variolation case, applied to the high-probability survival state, can be significant. Specifically, risk aversion means an individual places a high value on avoiding any loss. The \"doing nothing\" option preserves an $1-p = 0.90$ chance of avoiding any loss whatsoever. The variolation option eliminates this possibility, guaranteeing a loss of at least $c$ in wealth for all $(1-q)=0.985$ of survivors. This trade-off—giving up the high chance of a perfect outcome in exchange for a lower probability of death but a guaranteed smaller cost—can lead a risk-averse person to prefer the \"natural\" lottery.\n\nLet a specific concave function, e.g., $U(w) = \\sqrt{w}$, illustrate this with the given numbers:\n- $w_0=100, c=15, q=0.015$\n- $p=0.10, r=0.20, m=50$\n\n$EU_V = (1-0.015)U(100-15) = 0.985 \\sqrt{85} \\approx 0.985 \\times 9.2195 \\approx 9.081$\n$EU_N = (1-0.10)U(100) + (0.10)(1-0.20)U(100-50) = 0.90\\sqrt{100} + 0.08\\sqrt{50} \\approx 0.90(10) + 0.08(7.071) = 9 + 0.5657 = 9.5657$\n\nSince $9.081 < 9.5657$, a risk-averse individual with this utility function would rationally oppose variolation, even though the mortality risk $q=0.015$ is lower than the natural expected mortality $pr=0.02$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A) Because risk-averse decision-makers maximize expected wealth rather than expected utility, lower expected mortality ($q<pr$) implies lower expected wealth after variolation, so variolation must be worse.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The definition of a VNM agent, whether risk-averse, risk-neutral, or risk-loving, is that they maximize expected utility. Maximizing expected wealth is the specific behavior of a *risk-neutral* agent (for whom utility is a linear function of wealth). Therefore, the premise \"risk-averse decision-makers maximize expected wealth\" is incorrect. Furthermore, let's calculate the expected wealth for both options.\n$E[W_V] = (1-q)(w_0-c) = (1-0.015)(100-15) = 0.985 \\times 85 = 83.725$.\n$E[W_N] = (1-p)w_0 + p(1-r)(w_0-m) = (0.90)(100) + (0.10)(0.80)(100-50) = 90 + 0.08 \\times 50 = 90+4=94$.\nIn this example, $E[W_V] < E[W_N]$, so a risk-neutral agent would indeed oppose variolation. However, the reason given in the option for why a *risk-averse* person would is based on a false premise about their objective function.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B) Because with concave $U$, the certain loss $c$ imposed on all survivors by variolation and its immediate mortality risk $q$ can reduce expected utility below that of waiting, which preserves a chance $(1-p)$ of no loss at all; formally, it can occur that $(1-q)U(w_0-c)+q\\,U(0)<(1-p)U(w_0)+p\\big[(1-r)U(w_0-m)+r\\,U(0)\\big]$ even when $q<pr$.**\nThis option correctly identifies all the key elements of the rational choice. It invokes the concavity of $U$ (risk aversion). It correctly contrasts the certain loss $c$ under variolation with the large probability $(1-p)$ of 'no loss at all' under the natural lottery. This is the crucial trade-off. The formal inequality presented is precisely the condition $EU_V < EU_N$ that we derived. Finally, it correctly states that this can occur \"even when $q<pr$,\" which is the central puzzle the question asks to explain. This option is a perfect summary of the logic.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C) Because risk-averse individuals always prefer the option with lower variance regardless of costs, variolation is never opposed when its mortality risk is lower.**\nThis statement makes two incorrect claims. First, while risk aversion is related to a dislike of variance, decision-making is not solely based on minimizing variance. A risk-averse individual balances both expected return (or utility) and risk (variance). An option with higher variance but a sufficiently higher expected utility will be preferred. Stating they \"always prefer the option with lower variance regardless of costs\" is false. Second, the conclusion that \"variolation is never opposed when its mortality risk is lower\" is a direct contradiction of the premise of the problem and of the demonstration above. The entire point is to show that it *can* be rationally opposed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D) Because concavity of $U$ implies $E[U(W)]=U(E[W])$, only expected wealth matters; hence if expected mortality is lower, variolation must be preferred and cannot be opposed.**\nThis option contains a profound misunderstanding of the mathematics of risk aversion. For a strictly concave function $U$ and a non-constant random variable $W$, Jensen's inequality states that $E[U(W)] < U(E[W])$. The equality $E[U(W)] = U(E[W])$ holds only for linear utility functions (risk neutrality). The premise of the option is therefore mathematically false. Consequently, the conclusion that \"only expected wealth matters\" is also false; it is precisely because $E[U(W)] \\neq U(E[W])$ that expected utility and expected wealth are different criteria and that risk preferences matter. The entire chain of reasoning is built on an incorrect mathematical foundation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4783020"}, {"introduction": "Having analyzed the pitfalls of observational data and the complexities of individual choice, we now turn to a constructive challenge: how could physicians in the 18th century have generated more definitive evidence?

The question is clear and specific, asking for the identification of the *best* study design among a given set of options, evaluated against explicit criteria: strengthening causal inference, historical feasibility, and ethical plausibility.\n*   **Objective**: Yes. The language is neutral, formal, and free of subjective claims. It presents historical facts and scientific principles without bias.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws:\n1.  **Scientific or Factual Unsoundness**: The premises are sound.\n2.  **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant**: The topic is a classic case study in the history of epidemiology and is highly formalizable.\n3.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The setup is detailed and self-consistent, providing sufficient context and constraints to evaluate the options.\n4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The problem is carefully framed to work within realistic historical and scientific constraints.\n5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured**: The question is well-defined.\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological**: The problem is non-trivial, requiring a nuanced understanding of study design, ethics, and historical context.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: The merits of different epidemiological study designs are a verifiable topic within the science of public health and statistics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The analysis will proceed to the solution.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe core task is to identify the study design that best satisfies three criteria: (1) strength of causal inference, (2) feasibility in $1721$ Boston, and (3) ethical plausibility for the time. The strongest causal inference is typically achieved through randomization, which creates exchangeable groups (in expectation) and thus minimizes confounding.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Among households that declare willingness to be variolated, conduct a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized rollout: randomize consenting households within each parish by lottery to receive variolation at different preassigned dates over the ensuing weeks, maintain standard quarantine after variolation, and use parish records to pre-register outcomes (smallpox incidence, severity, and mortality). Analyze differences between early and late clusters at each time step with a prespecified difference-in-means estimator, controlling for calendar time.**\n\n*   **Causal Inference**: This design is exceptionally strong. It employs **randomization** (via lottery) to determine the *timing* of the intervention. At any point before the final step, the \"early\" clusters (already variolated) can be compared to the \"late\" clusters (not yet variolated). Because the assignment of timing is random, these two groups are exchangeable, aside from the intervention itself and the passage of a small amount of calendar time (which the design proposes to control for). This directly breaks the confounding by indication that plagues observational studies. Pre-registration of outcomes prevents reporting bias.\n*   **Feasibility**: This design is highly feasible given the stated resources. It uses lotteries, which were recognized as fair. It operates at the household level (\"clusters\") and uses parish records. The sequential rollout is logistically practical during a unfolding epidemic.\n*   **Ethics**: This design is ethically plausible. It operates only on \"households that declare willingness,\" thus respecting consent and avoiding coercion. A randomized rollout is an established ethical method for allocating a potentially beneficial but risky intervention when it cannot be given to all eligible and willing parties simultaneously. It does not deny variolation to anyone who wants it, but fairly allocates the order. It does not expose anyone to risk beyond the ongoing epidemic.\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**. This design robustly addresses the challenges of causal inference, feasibility, and ethics.\n\n**B. Conduct a matched case–control study after the epidemic using church burial registers to identify smallpox deaths, matching each decedent to two parishioners of similar age and neighborhood who survived, and ascertain prior variolation status from ministerial notes and physician ledgers.**\n\n*   **Causal Inference**: This is a retrospective **observational** study design. While matching on age and neighborhood attempts to control for some confounding variables, it cannot control for unmeasured or unrecorded confounders, which are the essence of \"confounding by indication\" (e.g., pre-existing health status, wealth, belief in medicine, exact exposure risk). It is a significant improvement over a crude, unmatched comparison, but it is fundamentally inferior to a randomized experiment for establishing causality.\n*   **Feasibility**: This is feasible, using the church registers and other records mentioned.\n*   **Ethics**: As a retrospective study, it poses minimal ethical risk to subjects, mainly concerning the use of their data.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This design is weaker for causal inference than a randomized design.\n\n**C. Assign variolation by alternation along streets on a single day (every other household offered variolation regardless of consent), thereby ensuring near-equal numbers of variolated and non-variolated households distributed across the town at the outset of the epidemic.**\n\n*   **Causal Inference**: This is a quasi-experimental design. The \"alternation\" assignment is systematic, not truly random, and could correlate with unobserved factors. However, the most significant flaw is ethical.\n*   **Feasibility**: Logistically simple.\n*   **Ethics**: The phrase \"regardless of consent\" is a fatal flaw. It explicitly violates the stated constraint to \"avoid coercion.\" Forcing a risky medical procedure on unwilling individuals is ethically unacceptable, both by modern standards and by the plausible standards of a community that included vigorous public debate on the matter.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The design is ethically indefensible due to its coercive nature.\n\n**D. Perform a human challenge study: variolate a group of volunteers and, after recovery, expose both variolated and non-variolated volunteers to the effluvia of smallpox patients under controlled observation to directly compare attack rates.**\n\n*   **Causal Inference**: This design would yield very strong evidence regarding the efficacy of variolation in preventing infection upon direct exposure.\n*   **Feasibility**: The \"controlled observation\" might be feasible in a pest house.\n*   **Ethics**: This is a grave ethical violation. It directly contradicts the explicit constraint to \"not deliberately expose unimmunized people to smallpox beyond the prevailing epidemic risk.\" A human challenge study *intentionally infects* the control group with a deadly pathogen. This poses an unacceptable risk of severe harm and death to the control subjects with no prospect of direct benefit.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The design is ethically impossible and violates a key rule of the problem.\n\n**E. Implement a randomized encouragement design: by lot, select certain parishes to receive sermons and public notices endorsing variolation, while others receive neutral messages; measure uptake and subsequent smallpox outcomes, and estimate the causal effect using the randomized encouragement as an instrument for variolation.**\n\n*   **Causal Inference**: This is a valid and sophisticated randomized design, using an Instrumental Variable (IV) approach. Randomizing encouragement creates exchangeable groups at the parish level with respect to their *propensity to be encouraged*. It is a powerful method for dealing with non-compliance. However, it estimates the \"complier average causal effect\" (CACE)—the effect of variolation on the subpopulation of people who would only get variolated if encouraged. This estimand may differ from the effect on other groups, and the statistical power of the design depends on how strongly the encouragement influences uptake.\n*   **Feasibility**: Entirely feasible using the means of communication and a lottery system as described.\n*   **Ethics**: Ethically sound. It does not coerce anyone and respects individual choice.\n*   **Comparison to A**: While Design E is valid, Design A is arguably superior in this context. The stepped-wedge design (A) randomizes the actual intervention (or its timing) among all willing participants, allowing for a more direct estimation of the average effect in this population. It is generally more statistically efficient and provides a more direct answer to the question of variolation's effect, compared to the more specific CACE estimand from the IV approach. Therefore, Design A would \"most strengthen\" causal inference in a more direct manner.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. While a strong design, it is arguably less direct and potentially less powerful than the stepped-wedge design (A) for answering the primary public health question.\n\n### Conclusion\nOption A presents a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial, which is a state-of-the-art design. It masterfully threads the needle, achieving strong causal inference through randomization while remaining entirely within the ethical and logistical constraints of $1721$ Boston. It is superior to the observational design (B), the coercive design (C), the unethical challenge study (D), and the less direct instrumental variable design (E).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4783059"}]}
