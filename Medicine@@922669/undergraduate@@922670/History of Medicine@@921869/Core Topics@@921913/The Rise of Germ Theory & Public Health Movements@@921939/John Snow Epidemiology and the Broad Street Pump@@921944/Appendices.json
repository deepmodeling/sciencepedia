The RRs are not identical ($5.0$ versus $6.0$), which suggests some degree of effect modification. The effect of the Broad Street pump water appears slightly stronger in the higher SES stratum. However, this difference is modest. Without a formal statistical test for homogeneity (such as a Breslow-Day test adapted for RRs), we can only make a qualitative judgment. Given that the values are reasonably close, it is often considered acceptable to present a single, pooled estimate.\n\nThe adjusted estimate, $RR_{MH} = 5.25$, lies between the two stratum-specific RRs ($5.0$ and $6.0$). This is a required property of the Mantel-Haenszel estimator, which is a weighted average.

You will learn why a naive pre-post comparison is misleading and how incorporating biological knowledge—specifically, the disease's incubation period—is essential for correctly interpreting the effect of a public health intervention. [@problem_id:4753217]", "problem": "John Snow’s inference about the Broad Street pump’s role in the London cholera outbreak hinged on temporally linking water exposure to cases under realistic assumptions about incubation. Consider a hypothetical dataset representing daily cholera case counts in the Soho area for the week before and the week after the Broad Street pump handle was removed. Assume the removal occurred at the boundary between the pre and post periods, and that the population at risk and case ascertainment remained stable across these two weeks. Cholera’s incubation period is short; use a conservative median incubation lag of $L=2$ days to reason about which post-removal days reflect pre-removal exposure.\n\nThe daily counts in the week before removal (days $t=-7$ to $t=-1$) are:\n$C_{-7}=3$, $C_{-6}=5$, $C_{-5}=12$, $C_{-4}=28$, $C_{-3}=45$, $C_{-2}=52$, $C_{-1}=40$.\n\nThe daily counts in the week after removal (days $t=+1$ to $t=+7$) are:\n$C_{+1}=38$, $C_{+2}=30$, $C_{+3}=20$, $C_{+4}=12$, $C_{+5}=8$, $C_{+6}=5$, $C_{+7}=3$.\n\nStarting from epidemiological first principles, define a simple pre–post causal estimand for the intervention effect that uses the ratio of average daily incidence after versus before removal and justify how to adjust the post period for the incubation lag $L$. Compute the naive post–pre ratio using all $7$ post-removal days and then compute the lag-adjusted post–pre ratio using only the post-removal days $t=+3$ through $t=+7$. Your final reported quantity must be the lag-adjusted ratio. Express the final answer as a unitless decimal rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The objective is to estimate the causal effect of removing the Broad Street pump handle on cholera incidence. A simple and common estimand for such a pre-post study design is the ratio of the average daily incidence in the post-intervention period to that in the pre-intervention period. Let $I_{pre}$ and $I_{post}$ be the average daily incidence rates for the respective periods. The estimand is the ratio $R = \\frac{I_{post}}{I_{pre}}$.\n\nGiven that the problem states the population at risk remained stable, the daily case count $C_t$ is directly proportional to the daily incidence rate. Therefore, the ratio of average daily case counts can be used as a valid proxy for the ratio of average daily incidence rates. Let $\\bar{C}_{pre}$ and $\\bar{C}_{post}$ be the average daily case counts. The estimand is then calculated as $R = \\frac{\\bar{C}_{post}}{\\bar{C}_{pre}}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the average daily case count for the pre-intervention period, which spans $7$ days from $t=-7$ to $t=-1$.\nThe total number of cases in the pre-period is:\n$$ \\sum_{t=-7}^{-1} C_t = C_{-7} + C_{-6} + C_{-5} + C_{-4} + C_{-3} + C_{-2} + C_{-1} $$\n$$ \\sum_{t=-7}^{-1} C_t = 3 + 5 + 12 + 28 + 45 + 52 + 40 = 185 $$\nThe average daily case count over these $7$ days is:\n$$ \\bar{C}_{pre} = \\frac{1}{7} \\sum_{t=-7}^{-1} C_t = \\frac{185}{7} $$\n\nNext, we must define the post-intervention period. A naive approach would be to use all available post-removal data, from $t=+1$ to $t=+7$. However, this is flawed because it ignores the disease's incubation period. The incubation period is the time delay between exposure to a pathogen and the onset of symptoms. For cholera, with a median incubation lag of $L=2$ days, a person who becomes a case on day $t_{case}$ was most likely infected on or around day $t_{infection} = t_{case} - L = t_{case} - 2$. The intervention—removal of the pump handle at $t=0$—stopped new exposures from this source. Therefore, cases observed shortly after $t=0$ are attributable to infections that occurred *before* the intervention. Specifically:\n-   Cases on day $t=+1$ likely resulted from infections around $t = +1 - 2 = -1$.\n-   Cases on day $t=+2$ likely resulted from infections around $t = +2 - 2 = 0$.\n\nSince these cases arise from pre-intervention or peri-intervention exposures, they do not reflect the effect of the intervention itself (the absence of contaminated water). To properly estimate the intervention's effect, we must analyze a post-intervention period where the observed cases correspond to a time window of infection that is fully post-intervention. A case observed on day $t=+3$ corresponds to an infection around day $t=+1$, which is after the pump was disabled. Therefore, to isolate the effect, the analysis of the post-intervention period should begin after the incubation lag has passed.\n\nAs specified, we use the lag-adjusted post-intervention period from $t=+3$ to $t=+7$. This period includes $5$ days. We calculate the average daily case count for this adjusted period, $\\bar{C}_{post, adj}$.\nThe total number of cases in the lag-adjusted post-period is:\n$$ \\sum_{t=3}^{7} C_t = C_{+3} + C_{+4} + C_{+5} + C_{+6} + C_{+7} $$\n$$ \\sum_{t=3}^{7} C_t = 20 + 12 + 8 + 5 + 3 = 48 $$\nThe average daily case count over these $5$ days is:\n$$ \\bar{C}_{post, adj} = \\frac{1}{5} \\sum_{t=3}^{7} C_t = \\frac{48}{5} $$\n\nNow, we can compute the lag-adjusted post–pre ratio, $R_{adj}$, which is the required final quantity.\n$$ R_{adj} = \\frac{\\bar{C}_{post, adj}}{\\bar{C}_{pre}} = \\frac{48/5}{185/7} $$\n$$ R_{adj} = \\frac{48 \\times 7}{5 \\times 185} = \\frac{336}{925} $$\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we perform the division and round to four significant figures.\n$$ R_{adj} \\approx 0.36324324... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.3632$.
