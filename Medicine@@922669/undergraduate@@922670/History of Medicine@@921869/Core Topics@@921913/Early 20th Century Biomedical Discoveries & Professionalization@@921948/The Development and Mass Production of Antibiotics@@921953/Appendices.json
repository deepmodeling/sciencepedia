In the dawn of the antibiotic age, pharmacologists needed a simple, quantitative way to measure this safety margin. This exercise introduces the therapeutic index, a foundational concept that compares the dose of a drug needed for a therapeutic effect to the dose that causes lethal toxicity. By calculating this value for a hypothetical early sulfonamide, you will gain insight into the crucial risk-benefit analyses that determined which of the first antibacterial agents were promising enough to pursue for mass production [@problem_id:4765221].", "problem": "A pharmacologist in the early antibiotic era evaluates a newly synthesized sulfonamide in a standardized rodent assay.

Your final reported value should be a single pure number; no rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard pharmacological calculation using plausible data within an accurate historical context.\n\nThe therapeutic index, denoted as $TI$, is a quantitative measurement of the relative safety of a drug. It reflects the margin between the dose that produces a therapeutic effect and the dose that produces a lethal effect. In classical pharmacology, particularly during the period in question, the $TI$ is most commonly defined as the ratio of the median lethal dose ($LD_{50}$) to the median effective dose ($ED_{50}$). The $LD_{50}$ is the dose required to kill half the members of a tested population, while the $ED_{50}$ is the dose that produces a specified therapeutic effect in half the population.\n\nThe formula for the therapeutic index is:\n$$\nTI = \\frac{LD_{50}}{ED_{50}}\n$$\n\nThe problem provides the following values from a standardized rodent assay:\n- The median effective dose for bacteriostatic action: $ED_{50} = 5\\ \\text{mg/kg}$\n- The median lethal dose for acute toxicity: $LD_{50} = 200\\ \\text{mg/kg}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula yields:\n$$\nTI = \\frac{200\\ \\text{mg/kg}}{5\\ \\text{mg/kg}}\n$$\n\nThe units of concentration ($\\text{mg/kg}$) cancel out, resulting in a dimensionless quantity, or a pure number, as requested.\n$$\nTI = 40\n$$\n\nA therapeutic index of $40$ indicates that, on average, the lethal dose is $40$ times higher than the dose required for a therapeutic effect. In the context of the early antibiotic era (circa the late $1930$s and early $1940$s), before the mass production of penicillin, severe bacterial infections were a leading cause of mortality. Therapeutic options were virtually nonexistent. The discovery of sulfonamides, the first class of effective systemic antibacterial agents, was a watershed moment in the history of medicine.\n\nA therapeutic index of this magnitude ($40$) would have been considered highly favorable. It represented a substantial safety margin, providing clinicians with confidence that the drug could be administered effectively without an unacceptably high risk of lethal toxicity. While not as safe as many modern antibiotics (some of which have a $TI$ in the hundreds or thousands), this level of safety was a revolutionary improvement over the alternative of no effective treatment. The risk-benefit analysis would have overwhelmingly favored the use of the drug. For clinicians, it meant they could treat previously fatal infections like streptococcal septicemia and pneumonia. For public health authorities and industry, a $TI$ of $40$ provided a strong quantitative justification to prioritize the chemical synthesis and mass production of sulfonamides. This demonstrated viability and acceptable safety profile catalyzed the investment and infrastructure development that would later be adapted for penicillin, thus playing a critical role in the broader trajectory of the development and mass production of all antibiotics. It established a paradigm for evaluating drug safety that helped bridge the gap between laboratory discovery and widespread clinical application.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{40}\n$$", "id": "4765221"}, {"introduction": "Once a promising antibiotic like penicillin was discovered, the challenge shifted from the laboratory bench to the factory floor.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Yield per Tray**\n\nThe total yield of penicillin per tray for each batch, denoted $Y_{\\text{tray}}$, is determined by the product of the filtrate concentration ($C$) and the volume ($V$), as per foundational fact (i).\n\nThe given values are:\n-   Concentration, $C = 2\\ \\text{OU/mL}$\n-   Volume, $V = 1\\ \\text{L}$\n\nTo ensure dimensional consistency, the volume must be converted from liters to milliliters using the given conversion factor: $1\\ \\text{L} = 1000\\ \\text{mL}$.\n$$V = 1\\ \\text{L} \\times \\frac{1000\\ \\text{mL}}{1\\ \\text{L}} = 1000\\ \\text{mL}$$\n\nNow, the yield per tray per batch is calculated:\n$$Y_{\\text{tray}} = C \\times V = (2\\ \\text{OU/mL}) \\times (1000\\ \\text{mL}) = 2000\\ \\text{OU}$$\n\nThe problem requires this result to be expressed with four significant figures.\n$$Y_{\\text{tray}} = 2.000 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{OU}$$\n\n**Part 2: Estimation of the Number of Trays Required**\n\nThe problem requires a total yield of $Y_{\\text{total}} = 10^{9}\\ \\text{OU}$ over a period of $T_{\\text{total}} = 26\\ \\text{days}$. The production process consists of continuous back-to-back batches. This implies a steady-state throughput, which allows us to work with production rates.\n\nFirst, we define the required production rate, $R_{\\text{req}}$, as the total target yield divided by the total time available.\n$$R_{\\text{req}} = \\frac{Y_{\\text{total}}}{T_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{10^{9}\\ \\text{OU}}{26\\ \\text{days}}$$\n\nNext, we define the production rate of a single tray, $R_{\\text{tray}}$. This is the yield from one tray, $Y_{\\text{tray}}$, divided by the time it takes to produce it, $T_{\\text{batch}}$.\n$$R_{\\text{tray}} = \\frac{Y_{\\text{tray}}}{T_{\\text{batch}}} = \\frac{2000\\ \\text{OU}}{7\\ \\text{days}}$$\n\nThe total number of trays required, $N_{\\text{trays}}$, is the ratio of the total required rate to the rate of a single tray.

The goal is to select a subset of patients to treat to maximize the total benefit, subject to a resource constraint.\n\nLet the set of patients be $\\mathcal{I} = \\{A, B, C, D, E, F, G\\}$. For each patient $i \\in \\mathcal{I}$, we define a binary decision variable $x_i$, where $x_i = 1$ if patient $i$ is treated, and $x_i = 0$ otherwise.\n\nThe \"value\" or benefit of treating patient $i$ is the expected number of lives saved, which we denote by $v_i$. This is calculated as the increase in survival probability: $v_i = t_i - s_i$.\n\nThe \"weight\" or cost of treating patient $i$ is the required dosage in vials, $d_i$.\n\nThe objective is to maximize the total value $V$:\n$$ \\text{maximize} \\quad V = \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{I}} v_i x_i $$\n\nThis maximization is subject to the constraint on the total number of vials:\n$$ \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{I}} d_i x_i \\le S $$\nwhere $S=12$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the value $v_i$ for each patient:\n- $v_A = t_A - s_A = 0.85 - 0.30 = 0.55$\n- $v_B = t_B - s_B = 0.90 - 0.40 = 0.50$\n- $v_C = t_C - s_C = 0.80 - 0.20 = 0.60$\n- $v_D = t_D - s_D = 0.99 - 0.95 = 0.04$\n- $v_E = t_E - s_E = 0.70 - 0.10 = 0.60$\n- $v_F = t_F - s_F = 0.85 - 0.50 = 0.35$\n- $v_G = t_G - s_G = 0.90 - 0.80 = 0.10$\n\nWe can summarize the patients' data (dosage $d_i$, value $v_i$) as follows:\n- Patient A: $(d_A, v_A) = (5, 0.55)$\n- Patient B: $(d_B, v_B) = (4, 0.50)$\n- Patient C: $(d_C, v_C) = (6, 0.60)$\n- Patient D: $(d_D, v_D) = (3, 0.04)$\n- Patient E: $(d_E, v_E) = (5, 0.60)$\n- Patient F: $(d_F, v_F) = (4, 0.35)$\n- Patient G: $(d_G, v_G) = (2, 0.10)$\n\nSince the number of patients ($n=7$) is small, we can solve this problem by systematically evaluating all feasible combinations of patients whose total dosage does not exceed the stock of $12$ vials.\n\nFirst, let's determine the maximum number of patients that can be treated. The dosages in increasing order are $2$ (G), $3$ (D), $4$ (B), $4$ (F), $5$ (A), $5$ (E), $6$ (C). The sum of the four smallest dosages is $d_G + d_D + d_B + d_F = 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 = 13$. Since $13 > 12$, it is impossible to treat four or more patients.

Total value: $v_C + v_E = 0.60 + 0.60 = 1.20$.\n- Patients A and E: $d_A + d_E = 5 + 5 = 10 \\le 12$. Total value: $v_A + v_E = 0.55 + 0.60 = 1.15$.\n- Patients B and C: $d_B + d_C = 4 + 6 = 10 \\le 12$.

Total value: $v_B + v_E = 0.50 + 0.60 = 1.10$.\nThe maximum value for a combination of two patients is $1.20$.\n\n**Combinations of 3 Patients:**\nWe extend promising two-patient combinations or build new three-patient combinations.\n- Let's check combinations that fully utilize the $12$ vials.\n  - Patients A, E, G: $d_A + d_E + d_G = 5 + 5 + 2 = 12$. This is a valid combination.\n    Total value: $v_A + v_E + v_G = 0.55 + 0.60 + 0.10 = 1.25$.\n  - Patients B, C, G: $d_B + d_C + d_G = 4 + 6 + 2 = 12$. This is a valid combination.\n    Total value: $v_B + v_C + v_G = 0.50 + 0.60 + 0.10 = 1.20$.\n  - Patients B, E, D: $d_B + d_E + d_D = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12$. This is a valid combination.\n    Total value: $v_B + v_E + v_D = 0.50 + 0.60 + 0.04 = 1.14$.\n  - Patients A, B, D: $d_A + d_B + d_D = 5 + 4 + 3 = 12$. This is a valid combination.\n    Total value: $v_A + v_B + v_D = 0.55 + 0.50 + 0.04 = 1.09$.\n- Let's check other combinations with total dosage less than $12$.\n  - Patients B, E, G: $d_B + d_E + d_G = 4 + 5 + 2 = 11$. Total value: $v_B + v_E + v_G = 0.50 + 0.60 + 0.10 = 1.20$.\n\nBy comparing the maximum values obtained for each case:\n- Max value for 1 patient: $0.60$.\n- Max value for 2 patients: $1.20$.\n- Max value for 3 patients: $1.25$.\n\nThe overall maximum expected number of lives saved is the largest of these values. The optimal strategy is to treat patients A, E, and G, which uses all $12$ vials and yields a total expected number of lives saved of $1.25$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.25}\n$$", "id": "4765306"}]}
