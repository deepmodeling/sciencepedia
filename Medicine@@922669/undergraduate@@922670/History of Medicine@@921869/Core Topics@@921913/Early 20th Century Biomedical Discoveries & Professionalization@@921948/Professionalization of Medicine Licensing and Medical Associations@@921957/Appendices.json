Assume there are $N=120{,}000$ physician members, each paying an annual dues amount of $d=\\$450$. The association allocates its annual dues revenue among three functional categories central to professional authority formation: education (continuing medical education, residency accreditation, and publication programs), advocacy (support for legislation and regulation related to licensing standards), and administration (organizational governance and compliance). The shares of the total annual dues revenue assigned to these categories are $0.40$ for education, $0.30$ for advocacy, and $0.30$ for administration.\n\nStarting from the definitions that total dues revenue equals the product of membership count and dues per member, and that each category’s allocation equals its share times the total revenue, compute the annual dues revenue and the allocated amounts to education, advocacy, and administration.

The given values are:\n$N = 120,000$\n$d = \\$450$\n\nLet $R_T$ represent the total annual dues revenue.

We are given the sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence of the condition (true competence). We will proceed by applying the fundamental definitions of conditional probability.\n\nLet $C$ be the event that a candidate is truly competent, and $E^+$ be the event that a candidate passes the exam. The givens can be stated as:\n- The prevalence of competence: $P(C) = 0.80$.\n- The sensitivity of the exam: $Se = P(E^+ | C) = 0.90$.\n- The specificity of the exam: $Sp = P(E^- | C^c) = 0.85$, where $C^c$ is the complement of $C$ (lack of competence) and $E^-$ is the complement of $E^+$ (failing the exam).\n\nFrom these givens, we can derive several other necessary probabilities.\nThe probability of a candidate lacking competence is:\n$$ P(C^c) = 1 - P(C) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 $$\nThe probability of a competent candidate failing the exam (false negative rate) is:\n$$ P(E^- | C) = 1 - P(E^+ | C) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10 $$\nThe probability of an incompetent candidate passing the exam (false positive rate) is:\n$$ P(E^+ | C^c) = 1 - P(E^- | C^c) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15 $$\n\n**1. Calculation of the Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\nThe PPV is defined as the probability of a candidate being competent given that they passed the exam, which is $P(C | E^+)$. Using the definition of conditional probability (which leads to Bayes' theorem):\n$$ P(C | E^+) = \\frac{P(E^+ \\cap C)}{P(E^+)} = \\frac{P(E^+ | C) P(C)}{P(E^+)} $$\nTo find the denominator, $P(E^+)$, we use the law of total probability, summing over the mutually exclusive events $C$ and $C^c$:\n$$ P(E^+) = P(E^+ | C) P(C) + P(E^+ | C^c) P(C^c) $$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$ P(E^+) = (0.90)(0.80) + (0.15)(0.20) = 0.72 + 0.03 = 0.75 $$\nNow we can compute the PPV:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(C | E^+) = \\frac{P(E^+ | C) P(C)}{P(E^+)} = \\frac{(0.90)(0.80)}{0.75} = \\frac{0.72}{0.75} $$\nTo express this as an exact decimal:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{72}{75} = \\frac{24 \\times 3}{25 \\times 3} = \\frac{24}{25} = 0.96 $$\n\n**2. Calculation of the Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\nThe NPV is defined as the probability of a candidate lacking competence given that they failed the exam, which is $P(C^c | E^-)$. Again, using the definition of conditional probability:\n$$ P(C^c | E^-) = \\frac{P(E^- \\cap C^c)}{P(E^-)} = \\frac{P(E^- | C^c) P(C^c)}{P(E^-)} $$\nFirst, we find the total probability of failing the exam, $P(E^-)$. Since failing is the complement of passing, we have:\n$$ P(E^-) = 1 - P(E^+) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 $$\nAlternatively, we can use the law of total probability for $P(E^-)$:\n$$ P(E^-) = P(E^- | C) P(C) + P(E^- | C^c) P(C^c) $$\n$$ P(E^-) = (0.10)(0.80) + (0.85)(0.20) = 0.08 + 0.17 = 0.25 $$\nThe results are consistent. Now we can compute the NPV:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = P(C^c | E^-) = \\frac{P(E^- | C^c) P(C^c)}{P(E^-)} = \\frac{(0.85)(0.20)}{0.25} = \\frac{0.17}{0.25} $$\nTo express this as an exact decimal:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{17}{25} = 0.68 $$\nThe positive predictive value is $0.96$ and the negative predictive value is $0.68$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.96  0.68 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4759702"}, {"introduction": "The establishment of stringent licensing standards is often justified by the need to ensure practitioner quality and patient safety.

The solution proceeds.\n\nThe deadweight loss is the loss in total economic surplus due to a market inefficiency, in this case, a quantity restriction imposed by licensing. Total surplus is maximized at the competitive equilibrium, where the marginal benefit to consumers (given by the demand curve) equals the marginal cost of production.\n\nThe competitive equilibrium point is given as $(Q_1, P_1) = (1000, \\$100)$.\nThe problem states that the pre-licensing supply is perfectly elastic at this price, which establishes that the marginal cost ($MC$) of a visit is constant and equal to $P_1$.\n$$MC = P_1 = \\$100$$\nAfter licensing, the quantity is restricted to $Q_2 = 800$ visits. At this quantity, consumers are willing to pay a price of $P_2 = \\$130$, which represents the marginal benefit of the $800$-th visit.\n\nThe deadweight loss arises because units of the good between $Q_2$ and $Q_1$ are no longer traded, even though for each of these units, the marginal benefit (given by the demand curve) is greater than the marginal cost ($MC = \\$100$).
