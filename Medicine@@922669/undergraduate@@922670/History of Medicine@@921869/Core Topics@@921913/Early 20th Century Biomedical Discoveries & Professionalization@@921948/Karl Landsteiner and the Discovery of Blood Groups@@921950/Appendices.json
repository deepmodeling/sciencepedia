The stated principles for safe transfusion of red cells and plasma are standard practice. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clearly defined patient profile and two explicit rules for determining transfusion compatibility. The question asks for a specific outcome (safe donor types) that can be uniquely determined by applying these rules to the given profile. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective:** The problem statement is composed of objective, technical descriptions and established scientific principles. There is no subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe patient is identified with the Bombay phenotype ($Oh$, $hh$). We must determine the compatible donor types for both red cells and plasma based on the patient's serological profile.\n\n**Patient's Profile:**\n- **RBC Antigens:** The patient has the genotype $hh$. Consequently, their RBCs lack the $H$ antigen. Without the $H$ antigen precursor, they cannot express $A$ or $B$ antigens, regardless of their $ABO$ genotype. Therefore, the patient's RBCs have **no** $A$, $B$, or $H$ antigens.\n- **Plasma Antibodies:** As noted for the Bombay phenotype, the patient's plasma contains antibodies against the antigens they lack. Since they lack $A$, $B$, and $H$ antigens, their plasma contains $\\text{anti-}A$, $\\text{anti-}B$, and a potent $\\text{anti-}H$.\n\n**Part 1: Safe Donors for Red Cell Transfusion**\n\nThe rule is that donor RBCs must lack the antigens targeted by the recipient's antibodies.\n- **Recipient's Antibodies:** $\\text{anti-}A$, $\\text{anti-}B$, $\\text{anti-}H$.\n- We must find a donor whose RBCs do not possess $A$, $B$, or $H$ antigens.\n\nLet's evaluate potential donor types:\n- **Type $A$ donor:** RBCs have $A$ antigen and $H$ antigen. Incompatible due to reaction with recipient's $\\text{anti-}A$ and $\\text{anti-}H$.\n- **Type $B$ donor:** RBCs have $B$ antigen and $H$ antigen. Incompatible due to reaction with recipient's $\\text{anti-}B$ and $\\text{anti-}H$.\n- **Type $AB$ donor:** RBCs have $A$, $B$, and $H$ antigens. Incompatible due to reaction with recipient's $\\text{anti-}A$, $\\text{anti-}B$, and $\\text{anti-}H$.\n- **Type $O$ donor (standard):** These individuals have the genotype $H/H$ or $H/h$. Their RBCs lack $A$ and $B$ antigens but **possess the $H$ antigen**. Incompatible due to a severe reaction between the potent recipient $\\text{anti-}H$ and the donor's $H$ antigen.\n- **Bombay phenotype ($hh$) donor:** RBCs lack $A$, $B$, and $H$ antigens. These RBCs will not be attacked by the recipient's $\\text{anti-}A$, $\\text{anti-}B$, or $\\text{anti-}H$ antibodies. This is a compatible match.\n\n**Conclusion for Red Cells:** Only red cells from a Bombay phenotype ($hh$) donor are safe for this patient.\n\n**Part 2: Safe Donors for Plasma Transfusion**\n\nThe rule is that donor plasma must lack antibodies that target the recipient's RBC antigens.\n- **Recipient's RBC Antigens:** None ($A$, $B$, or $H$).\n- We must find a donor whose plasma does not contain antibodies that can bind to the recipient's \"antigen-negative\" RBCs.\n\nLet's evaluate potential donor plasma types:\n- **Type $A$ donor plasma:** Contains $\\text{anti-}B$. The recipient's RBCs lack the $B$ antigen, so no reaction will occur. Safe.\n- **Type $B$ donor plasma:** Contains $\\text{anti-}A$. The recipient's RBCs lack the $A$ antigen, so no reaction will occur. Safe.\n- **Type $O$ donor plasma:** Contains $\\text{anti-}A$ and $\\text{anti-}B$. The recipient's RBCs lack both $A$ and $B$ antigens, so no reaction will occur. Safe.\n- **Type $AB$ donor plasma:** Contains no $ABO$ antibodies ($\\text{no anti-}A$, $\\text{no anti-}B$). No reaction can occur. Safe.\n- **Bombay phenotype ($hh$) donor plasma:** Contains $\\text{anti-}A$, $\\text{anti-}B$, and $\\text{anti-}H$. The recipient's RBCs lack $A$, $B$, and $H$ antigens, so no reaction will occur. Safe.\n\n**Conclusion for Plasma:** Since the patient's red cells have no antigens for any ABO or H-system antibody to target, plasma from a donor of **any** ABO type ($O$, $A$, $B$, or $AB$) is safe. This makes the patient a universal recipient for plasma.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Safe Red Cells: From Bombay phenotype ($hh$) donors only.\n- Safe Plasma: From donors of any $ABO$ type ($O$, $A$, $B$, or $AB$).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Red cells: Bombay phenotype ($hh$) only; Plasma: $AB$ donors only.**\n- Red cells component: Correct.\n- Plasma component: Incorrect. This is overly restrictive. While plasma from $AB$ donors is safe, plasma from $O$, $A$, and $B$ donors is also safe.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Red cells: $O$ donors; Plasma: $AB$ donors.**\n- Red cells component: Incorrect. Standard type $O$ RBCs possess the $H$ antigen and would cause a transfusion reaction.\n- Plasma component: Incorrect.

Red cells: $O$ donors; Plasma: $O$ donors.**\n- Red cells component: Incorrect. Standard type $O$ donors are not safe.\n- Plasma component: Incorrect. Overly restrictive, as other plasma types are also safe.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Red cells: Bombay phenotype ($hh$) only; Plasma: $O$ donors only.**\n- Red cells component: Correct.\n- Plasma component: Incorrect.

This practice [@problem_id:4753924] places you in the role of a diagnostician tasked with resolving a classic ABO discrepancy involving a weak A subgroup. By designing a logical testing algorithm, you will learn how advanced serological techniques are used to unravel complex cases and ensure accurate blood typing.", "problem": "A patient presents with an apparent discrepancy between forward and reverse typing in the A, B, O blood group system (ABO), a classic problem whose resolution relies on Karl Landsteiner’s foundational principle that agglutination in blood grouping arises from specific interactions between antigens on red blood cells (RBCs) and naturally occurring antibodies in plasma. The foundational base for analysis includes: (i) Landsteiner’s agglutination principle; (ii) ABO antigens are carbohydrate structures on RBCs built upon the H antigen; (iii) ABO sera contain naturally occurring immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies reactive at room temperature; (iv) subgroups of A (notably A1 and A2) differ in antigen density and structural detail, such that A2 and A2B individuals may develop anti-A1; (v) plant lectins, including Dolichos biflorus (commonly referred to as the A1 lectin) and Ulex europaeus (anti-H lectin), show defined carbohydrate specificity; and (vi) absorption-elution can confirm the presence of weak antigens on RBCs or the specificity of antibodies.\n\nInitial test results are as follows: forward typing shows anti-A yields $1+$ agglutination, anti-B yields $4+$, and anti-A,B yields $2+$. Reverse typing shows the patient’s plasma agglutinates A1 reagent cells at $2+$ but does not agglutinate B reagent cells ($0$). The auto-control is negative and the direct antiglobulin test (DAT) is negative. These findings suggest an A-subgroup with anti-A1, and the clinical question is whether the patient is A2B with anti-A1, a historically recognized pattern emerging from the differential expression of A antigens discovered subsequent to Landsteiner’s original ABO work.\n\nWhich diagnostic algorithm most soundly resolves the suspected A2B typing discrepancy using lectins, absorption-elution, and antibody identification steps, while controlling for confounders and adhering to the foundational principles outlined above?\n\nA. Begin by repeating forward and reverse ABO typing to confirm the discrepancy and exclude technical error. Test the patient’s RBCs with Dolichos biflorus (A1 lectin) and Ulex europaeus (anti-H lectin) to assess subgroup and H antigen expression. In reverse typing, include A2 reagent cells to distinguish anti-A1 from pan-agglutinin; identify antibody specificity if plasma reacts with A1 but not A2. Perform absorption-elution using a known anti-A to absorb onto the patient’s RBCs, elute, and test the eluate against A1 reagent cells; detection of anti-A in the eluate confirms the presence of A antigen on the patient’s RBCs. Conclude A2B with anti-A1 and document transfusion implications after assessing the thermal amplitude of anti-A1.\n\nB. Start with Ulex europaeus (anti-H lectin) testing; if anti-H is positive, assign AB without further studies. Skip reverse typing and proceed directly to a broad antibody screen at $37^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$. Perform elution from the patient’s serum to identify potential cold antibodies. Conclude that the discrepancy is resolved if no clinically significant $37^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ antibodies are detected.\n\nC. Perform absorption-elution using anti-B onto the patient’s RBCs to confirm AB status, then use peanut lectin (Arachis hypogaea) to verify A expression. Identify anti-A2 in the patient’s plasma by testing against A2 reagent cells; if reactive, diagnose A2B with anti-A2 and disregard anti-A1 testing as irrelevant.\n\nD. Address the discrepancy by enzyme treating the patient’s RBCs to enhance A antigen expression, then retype. Use only reverse typing with A1 reagent cells to infer antibody specificity; if reactive, assign A1B with a weak A phenotype. Defer lectin testing and absorption-elution as unnecessary given enzyme enhancement.\n\nE. Immediately adsorb the patient’s plasma with A1 cells at room temperature to remove any anti-A1, elute from the A1 cells, and test the eluate against A1 and A2 RBCs to confirm anti-A1 specificity. If the eluate agglutinates A1 cells but not A2 cells, report anti-A1. Rely on this antibody identification as sufficient to assign A2B status; consider lectin testing optional and omit absorption-elution from the patient’s RBCs.", "solution": "The user requires a critical validation of the problem statement, followed by a rigorous derivation of the solution and evaluation of all options.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n#### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem statement provides the following information:\n\n**Foundational Principles:**\n*   (i) Karl Landsteiner’s agglutination principle: Specific interactions between antigens on red blood cells (RBCs) and antibodies in plasma.\n*   (ii) ABO antigens are carbohydrate structures on RBCs built upon the H antigen.\n*   (iii) ABO sera contain naturally occurring immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies reactive at room temperature.\n*   (iv) Subgroups of A (notably A1 and A2) differ in antigen density and structure; A2 and A2B individuals may develop anti-A1.\n*   (v) Plant lectins, *Dolichos biflorus* (A1 lectin) and *Ulex europaeus* (anti-H lectin), have defined carbohydrate specificity.\n*   (vi) Absorption-elution can confirm the presence of weak antigens on RBCs or the specificity of antibodies.\n\n**Initial Test Results:**\n*   Patient: A patient with an apparent discrepancy in ABO typing.\n*   Forward Typing (patient's RBCs):\n    *   anti-A: $1+$ agglutination\n    *   anti-B: $4+$ agglutination\n    *   anti-A,B: $2+$ agglutination\n*   Reverse Typing (patient's plasma):\n    *   A1 reagent cells: $2+$ agglutination\n    *   B reagent cells: $0$ (no agglutination)\n*   Controls:\n    *   Auto-control: negative\n    *   Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT): negative\n\n**Clinical Question:**\n*   The findings suggest an A-subgroup with anti-A1.\n*   The specific question is whether the patient is A2B with anti-A1.\n*   The goal is to identify the most sound diagnostic algorithm to resolve this discrepancy using lectins, absorption-elution, and antibody identification.\n\n#### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n*   **Scientific Groundedness:** The problem is firmly grounded in the principles of immunohematology, a sub-discipline of hematology and transfusion medicine. All stated principles (Landsteiner's Law, ABO genetics, antigen/antibody characteristics, lectin specificity, absorption-elution techniques) are standard, factually correct, and central to the field. The initial test results present a classic and realistic serological problem. The problem is free of pseudoscience and speculation.\n*   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It presents a complete set of initial data for a common type of ABO discrepancy and asks for the \"most sound\" resolution algorithm. In clinical laboratory science, standardized, evidence-based algorithms exist for such problems, making it possible to identify a \"most sound\" or \"best practice\" approach from a set of options. A unique and meaningful resolution exists.\n*   **Objectivity:** The language is technical, precise, and devoid of subjective or biased statements. The description of agglutination strengths ($1+$, $2+$, $4+$) and reagents (anti-A, anti-B, A1 cells, etc.) is standard laboratory nomenclature.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It represents a standard, formalizable problem in clinical immunohematology. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to formulate the most rigorous and sound diagnostic algorithm to resolve the suspected A2B with anti-A1 status. The patient's results show a discrepancy between forward and reverse typing. The forward type suggests an AB group (reactions with both anti-A and anti-B), but the A reaction is weak ($1+$). The reverse type is inconsistent with a standard AB group, as AB individuals normally lack ABO antibodies, yet this patient's plasma agglutinates A1 cells. This pattern ($A_{weak}B$ forward type with anti-A1 in the serum) is the classic presentation of an A2B individual who has formed anti-A1. A sound algorithm must definitively confirm both the red cell phenotype (A2B) and the antibody specificity (anti-A1).\n\nA comprehensive algorithm should include the following logical steps:\n\n1.  **Exclude Technical Error:** Before extensive workup, it is standard practice to repeat the initial tests to ensure the discrepancy is real and not due to clerical error, reagent issues, or procedural mistakes.\n\n2.  **Characterize the Red Cell Antigens:**\n    *   **A Subgroup Determination:** The central hypothesis is that the patient has an A subgroup. The definitive reagent to distinguish A1 from A2 phenotypes is the lectin from *Dolichos biflorus*, which agglutinates A1 cells but not A2 cells. The patient's RBCs should be tested with this A1 lectin. A negative reaction would support the A2 hypothesis.\n    *   **H Antigen Quantification (Supportive):** The amount of H antigen is inversely related to the efficiency of its conversion to A or B antigens. The order of H antigen amount is O > A2 > B > A2B > A1 > A1B. Testing the patient's RBCs with the anti-H lectin, *Ulex europaeus*, provides supportive evidence. A2B cells are expected to have more H antigen (and thus react more strongly with anti-H) than A1B cells.\n    *   **Confirmation of Weak A Antigen:** The weak ($1+$) reaction with anti-A needs confirmation. The most definitive technique is absorption-elution. A known anti-A reagent is incubated (absorbed) with the patient's RBCs. If the A antigen is present, the antibody will bind. After washing the cells, the bound antibody is recovered (eluted) and tested against known A1 and A2 cells. A positive reaction from the eluate confirms the presence of the A antigen on the patient's RBCs.\n\n3.  **Characterize the Plasma Antibody:**\n    *   **Specificity Determination:** The patient's plasma reacts with A1 cells. To confirm the antibody is anti-A1, it must be shown to be non-reactive with A2 cells. Therefore, the reverse typing panel must be expanded to include A2 reagent cells. Testing against group O cells is also necessary to rule out other common or unexpected alloantibodies. The expected result for anti-A1 is: reactive with A1 cells, non-reactive with A2 cells, and non-reactive with B cells (as already observed) and O cells.\n\n4.  **Synthesize Findings and Assess Clinical Significance:**\n    *   **Conclusion:** If the patient's RBCs are non-reactive with *Dolichos biflorus* lectin and reactive with anti-B, they are phenotyped as A2B. If the plasma reacts with A1 cells but not A2 cells, the antibody is identified as anti-A1.\n    *   **Transfusion Protocol:** The clinical significance of anti-A1 depends on its thermal amplitude. The antibody's reactivity should be tested at $37^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$. If it is reactive at body temperature, it is potentially clinically significant, and the patient should receive A1-negative red cell products (i.e., from group A2, A2B, O, or B donors). If it is only reactive at room temperature or below, it is generally considered clinically insignificant.\n\nThe most sound diagnostic algorithm will systematically incorporate all these steps.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**Option A:**\n- *\"Begin by repeating forward and reverse ABO typing to confirm the discrepancy and exclude technical error.\"* — **Correct**. This is the mandatory first step in any discrepancy workup.\n- *\"Test the patient’s RBCs with Dolichos biflorus (A1 lectin) and Ulex europaeus (anti-H lectin)...\"* — **Correct**. *Dolichos biflorus* is the primary reagent for A1/A2 subgrouping. *Ulex europaeus* provides valuable supporting data about H antigen expression.\n- *\"In reverse typing, include A2 reagent cells to distinguish anti-A1 from pan-agglutinin; identify antibody specificity if plasma reacts with A1 but not A2.\"* — **Correct**. This is the standard procedure to definitively identify anti-A1.\n- *\"Perform absorption-elution using a known anti-A to absorb onto the patient’s RBCs, elute, and test the eluate...\"* — **Correct**. This is the gold standard method to prove the existence of a weakly expressed A antigen on the patient's RBCs.\n- *\"Conclude A2B with anti-A1 and document transfusion implications after assessing the thermal amplitude of anti-A1.\"* — **Correct**. This represents the proper conclusion and necessary follow-up for patient safety.\nThis option describes a complete and logically sequenced standard-of-care algorithm.\n\n**Option B:**\n- *\"Start with Ulex europaeus (anti-H lectin) testing...\"* — **Incorrect**. While useful, anti-H testing is supportive, not the primary or starting test for A subgrouping.\n- *\"...if anti-H is positive, assign AB without further studies.\"* — **Incorrect**. This is a grossly inadequate conclusion. Both A1B and A2B can show some reactivity with anti-H, and this test does not resolve the A subgroup or the nature of the antibody.\n- *\"Skip reverse typing...\"* — **Incorrect**. This is a major error. The reverse type is essential for both ABO confirmation and antibody identification; skipping it ignores half of the data.\n- *\"Perform elution from the patient’s serum...\"* — **Incorrect**. This is a nonsensical statement. Elution is a technique to recover antibodies bound to red blood cells, not from serum/plasma.\n- *\"Conclude that the discrepancy is resolved if no clinically significant $37^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ antibodies are detected.\"* — **Incorrect**. The ABO type must be correctly established regardless of the thermal amplitude of any antibody. Ignoring an ABO discrepancy is a critical safety failure.\n\n**Option C:**\n- *\"Perform absorption-elution using anti-B onto the patient’s RBCs...\"* — **Incorrect**. The anti-B reaction was strong ($4+$), indicating the B antigen is clearly present. An absorption-elution is unnecessary and would be a misapplication of the technique.\n- *\"...use peanut lectin (Arachis hypogaea) to verify A expression.\"* — **Incorrect**. Peanut lectin (PNA) is specific for the cryptic T-antigen and has no role in ABO subgrouping.\n- *\"Identify anti-A2 in the patient’s plasma...\"* — **Incorrect**. The serological picture points to anti-A1. Individuals of subgroup A2 or A2B can make anti-A1; they cannot make anti-A2, as they possess the A2 antigen.\n- *\"diagnose A2B with anti-A2\"* — **Incorrect**. This is a logically and immunologically impossible conclusion based on the data.\n\n**Option D:**\n- *\"Address the discrepancy by enzyme treating the patient’s RBCs to enhance A antigen expression...\"* — **Incorrect**. While enzymes can enhance ABO activity, they are not the primary method for subgrouping and can cause non-specific reactions. Lectin testing is the correct primary approach.\n- *\"Use only reverse typing with A1 reagent cells to infer antibody specificity...\"* — **Incorrect**. This is insufficient. To prove anti-A1 specificity, one *must* demonstrate non-reactivity with A2 cells.\n- *\"if reactive, assign A1B with a weak A phenotype.\"* — **Incorrect**. This logic is reversed. The presence of an antibody reactive with A1 cells in the plasma is evidence that the patient's own cells *lack* the A1 antigen. Therefore, a diagnosis of A1B is incorrect.\n- *\"Defer lectin testing and absorption-elution as unnecessary...\"* — **Incorrect**. These are the most critical tests needed to solve the problem.\n\n**Option E:**\n- *\"Immediately adsorb the patient’s plasma with A1 cells ... elute from the A1 cells, and test the eluate ... to confirm anti-A1 specificity.\"* — This describes a valid procedure for confirming antibody identity, but it is not the most sound *overall algorithm*. This procedure only addresses the antibody. It does not resolve the forward typing discrepancy (i.e., verifying the patient's RBC phenotype).\n- *\"Rely on this antibody identification as sufficient to assign A2B status...\"* — **Incorrect**. This is a critical logical flaw. Identifying anti-A1 in the plasma creates a strong suspicion that the patient is A2B, but it is not proof. The patient's red cell phenotype must be directly confirmed using lectins. Making a diagnosis based on an inference without direct confirmation of the cell type is not a sound or complete diagnostic process.\n- *\"...consider lectin testing optional and omit absorption-elution from the patient’s RBCs.\"* — **Incorrect**. Omitting the definitive tests for the patient's red cell antigens (lectin testing for A1/A2, and absorption-elution for the weak A) leaves the forward typing discrepancy unresolved and violates best practices.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nOption A provides the only algorithm that is comprehensive, scientifically sound, and follows the established best practices for resolving an ABO discrepancy of this nature. It correctly sequences the necessary tests for both red cell antigen characterization and plasma antibody identification.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4753924"}, {"introduction": "Karl Landsteiner's discovery of blood groups provided one of the first and most powerful genetic markers for studying human populations.

The given frequencies are $p=0.3$, $q=0.2$, and $r=0.5$.\n\nAccording to the Hardy–Weinberg principle, the expected genotype frequencies in a population after one generation of random mating are given by the terms of the trinomial expansion of $(p+q+r)^2$.\n$$ (p+q+r)^2 = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + 2pq + 2pr + 2qr = 1 $$\nEach term in this expansion corresponds to the frequency of a specific genotype:\n-   Frequency of genotype $I^{A}I^{A}$ is $p^2$.\n-   Frequency of genotype $I^{B}I^{B}$ is $q^2$.\n-   Frequency of genotype $ii$ is $r^2$.\n-   Frequency of genotype $I^{A}I^{B}$ is $2pq$.\n-   Frequency of genotype $I^{A}i$ is $2pr$.\n-   Frequency of genotype $I^{B}i$ is $2qr$.\n\nTo find the frequency of each phenotype, we sum the frequencies of the genotypes that produce that phenotype.\n\n**1. Phenotype O**\nThe phenotype O corresponds to a single genotype, $ii$.\n$$ \\text{Freq(O)} = \\text{Freq(ii)} = r^2 $$\nSubstituting the given value $r=0.5$:\n$$ \\text{Freq(O)} = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 $$\n\n**2. Phenotype A**\nThe phenotype A corresponds to two genotypes, the homozygous $I^{A}I^{A}$ and the heterozygous $I^{A}i$.\n$$ \\text{Freq(A)} = \\text{Freq}(I^{A}I^{A}) + \\text{Freq}(I^{A}i) = p^2 + 2pr $$\nSubstituting the given values $p=0.3$ and $r=0.5$:\n$$ \\text{Freq(A)} = (0.3)^2 + 2(0.3)(0.5) = 0.09 + 0.30 = 0.39 $$\n\n**3. Phenotype B**\nThe phenotype B corresponds to two genotypes, the homozygous $I^{B}I^{B}$ and the heterozygous $I^{B}i$.\n$$ \\text{Freq(B)} = \\text{Freq}(I^{B}I^{B}) + \\text{Freq}(I^{B}i) = q^2 + 2qr $$\nSubstituting the given values $q=0.2$ and $r=0.5$:\n$$ \\text{Freq(B)} = (0.2)^2 + 2(0.2)(0.5) = 0.04 + 0.20 = 0.24 $$\n\n**4. Phenotype AB**\nThe phenotype AB corresponds to a single genotype, $I^{A}I^{B}$, resulting from the codominance of alleles $I^{A}$ and $I^{B}$.\n$$ \\text{Freq(AB)} = \\text{Freq}(I^{A}I^{B}) = 2pq $$\nSubstituting the given values $p=0.3$ and $q=0.2$:\n$$ \\text{Freq(AB)} = 2(0.3)(0.2) = 2(0.06) = 0.12 $$\n\nTo verify the calculations, the sum of all phenotype frequencies must equal $1$.\n$$ \\text{Freq(A)} + \\text{Freq(B)} + \\text{Freq(AB)} + \\text{Freq(O)} = 0.39 + 0.24 + 0.12 + 0.25 = 1.00 $$\nThe calculation is correct.\n\nThe problem requires the results to be expressed as decimals rounded to four significant figures.\n-   Proportion of A: $0.39 \\rightarrow 0.3900$\n-   Proportion of B: $0.24 \\rightarrow 0.2400$\n-   Proportion of AB: $0.12 \\rightarrow 0.1200$\n-   Proportion of O: $0.25 \\rightarrow 0.2500$\n\nThe final proportions for phenotypes A, B, AB, and O are $0.3900$, $0.2400$, $0.1200$, and $0.2500$, respectively.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.3900 & 0.2400 & 0.1200 & 0.2500 \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "4753911"}]}
