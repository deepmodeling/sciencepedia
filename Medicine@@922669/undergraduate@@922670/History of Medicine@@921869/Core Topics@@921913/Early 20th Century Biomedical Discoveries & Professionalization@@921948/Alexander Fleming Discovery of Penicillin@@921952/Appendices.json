{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The scientific method demands more than just observation; it requires controlled experiments to establish cause and effect. This practice challenges you to step into Fleming's shoes and design the minimal experiment needed to prove that the mold itself, and not some environmental fluke like a change in temperature or humidity, was responsible for inhibiting bacterial growth. It is a foundational exercise in ruling out confounding variables and thinking like a true experimentalist [@problem_id:4736263].", "problem": "Alexander Fleming’s famous observation in $1928$ involved a bacterial lawn of Staphylococcus aureus interrupted by a contaminating Penicillium colony. Suppose you are asked to move from anecdote to inference: design the minimal control configuration that would allow Fleming to conclude that the inhibitory effect is attributable to the mold, rather than to changes in incubation temperature or humidity. You have the following contextual constraints and resources: the incubator is known to have a shelf temperature gradient of up to $1^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$; ambient Relative Humidity (RH) fluctuates between $40\\%$ and $70\\%$; standard covered Petri dishes tend to maintain a fairly uniform microenvironment when sealed; you can seal dishes with Parafilm; you have an actively growing Penicillium notatum culture and a fresh Staphylococcus aureus culture; you may cut agar plugs with a cork borer of $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ diameter. Rely only on fundamental principles of controlled experimentation: to infer causality, the compared conditions must be identical in all respects except the suspected causal factor.\n\nWhich option describes the minimal set of controls and procedural details sufficient to attribute any bacterial growth inhibition to the mold rather than to temperature or humidity?\n\nA. Prepare two separate plates: spread a Staphylococcus aureus lawn on each; place a live Penicillium notatum agar plug at the edge of only one plate; leave both dish lids slightly ajar to mimic bench conditions; incubate side by side on an incubator shelf known to have up to $1^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ gradient; compare growth patterns after $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n\nB. Prepare three separate unsealed plates: two Staphylococcus aureus–only plates placed at the left and right extremes of the incubator shelf to “map” temperature effects, and one plate with both Staphylococcus aureus and a Penicillium notatum plug placed at the center of the shelf; compare all plates after $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ to determine whether inhibition near the mold exceeds any differences seen across the shelf.\n\nC. On a single plate, spread a uniform Staphylococcus aureus lawn; place one $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ live Penicillium notatum agar plug near the plate edge; immediately seal the plate with Parafilm to equilibrate internal RH; incubate at $35^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ for $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$. Interpret inhibition only if a localized zone of no growth appears adjacent to the plug while robust bacterial growth persists elsewhere on the same plate.\n\nD. Prepare two plates: on one, place a heat-killed Penicillium notatum agar plug onto a Staphylococcus aureus lawn; on the other, place a live Penicillium notatum plug onto a Staphylococcus aureus lawn; incubate the heat-killed plate at $30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and the live-mold plate at $35^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ with lids unsealed to allow ambient RH fluctuations; attribute any differences to the biological activity of the mold.\n\nE. Spot $10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ of sterile filtrate of Penicillium notatum culture onto a paper disc centered on one Staphylococcus aureus lawn plate and place a solvent-only disc onto a separate Staphylococcus aureus lawn plate; incubate both plates unsealed in different positions in the same incubator for $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$; attribute any observed difference to the filtrate rather than environmental factors.", "solution": "Begin from the first principles of causal inference in experimental design: to ascribe a measured effect to a specific factor, all other variables must be held constant so that the only systematic difference between compared conditions is the putative causal variable. In microbiological plates, sealing a covered Petri dish helps equalize microenvironmental conditions inside the dish, rendering temperature and Relative Humidity (RH) essentially uniform across locations on the same plate. Therefore, an “internal control” on the same sealed plate exposes both control and experimental regions to identical temperature and humidity. If a localized effect occurs near the mold while the remainder of the plate grows normally, temperature and humidity variations cannot explain the spatially restricted inhibition. This leverages the logic that spatially varying outcomes under spatially invariant conditions implicate a spatially localized cause, here the mold or its products.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Two separate plates are used, with lids deliberately left ajar, and the incubator shelf is known to have a temperature gradient up to $1^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. Because the plates are separate and unsealed, they can each experience slightly different RH and temperature, especially given ambient RH fluctuations between $40\\%$ and $70\\%$. Any difference in bacterial growth between plates could be due to the mold, but could also be due to small differences in temperature or humidity exposure. This configuration fails the requirement that the only systematic difference be the presence of mold; thus it does not eliminate the environmental confound. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nB. This design attempts to “map” temperature effects using two bacteria-only plates at shelf extremes while placing the mold plate at the center. However, all plates are unsealed and physically separate. The experimental plate and control plates do not share identical microenvironments; RH and temperature can differ among positions, and time-varying ambient conditions can affect plates differently. Moreover, even if the two bacteria-only plates reveal a gradient, the experimental plate’s condition remains unmatched to either control. The approach is not minimal and does not remove the temperature and humidity confound because the compared conditions differ in position and sealing. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. A single sealed plate serves as both experimental and control by exploiting spatial comparison on the same dish. Sealing with Parafilm equalizes internal RH, and a covered Petri dish equilibrates to a near-uniform temperature across its surface inside an incubator set at $35^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. The only spatially varying factor is the presence of the live Penicillium notatum plug, from which inhibitory substances may diffuse. If after $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ there is robust bacterial growth across the plate except for a localized zone of inhibition adjacent to the plug, then temperature and humidity cannot account for the effect because those conditions are uniform across the plate. By the causal logic of controlled experiments, the observed local inhibition can be attributed to the mold or its products. This is both sufficient and minimal: it requires only one plate and uses an internal control to remove environmental confounds. Verdict — Correct.\n\nD. Comparing a heat-killed mold plate and a live-mold plate could, in principle, speak to biological activity, but the design incubates them at different temperatures with unsealed lids and ambient RH fluctuations. Differences in growth between the plates are confounded by temperature and humidity as well as the live versus heat-killed status. Because the environmental conditions are not held constant across the comparison, causality cannot be assigned solely to the mold’s biology. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nE. Applying filtrate to one plate and solvent to a separate plate tests for a diffusible factor in concept, but the plates are separate, unsealed, and placed in different positions. As in A and B, differences in temperature or RH could produce differences in growth across plates. The comparison therefore does not control environmental variables sufficiently to attribute effects to the filtrate (and by extension the mold). A minimal, valid variant would place both discs on the same sealed plate, but that is not what is described. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, only option C provides a minimal and sufficient control scheme that rules out temperature and humidity differences by using an internal control under identical microenvironmental conditions, leaving the presence of the mold as the only systematic difference responsible for the localized inhibition pattern.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4736263"}, {"introduction": "Fleming's discovery was monumental, but early on it became clear that penicillin was not a universal cure effective against all bacteria. This exercise presents a scenario where the famous zone of inhibition fails to appear, pushing you to investigate the underlying biological reasons. By diagnosing this experimental \"failure,\" you will explore the fundamental structural differences between bacteria that determine their susceptibility, a core concept in understanding an antibiotic's spectrum of activity [@problem_id:2062300].", "problem": "A microbiology student attempts to replicate Alexander Fleming's discovery of antibiosis. The student streaks a bacterial culture across an agar plate and then introduces a colony of a mold, *Penicillium chrysogenum*, which is a known high-yield producer of penicillin. After co-incubation, the student is surprised to find that the bacterial lawn grows right up to the edge of the mold colony, with no visible zone of inhibition. Fleming famously used *Staphylococcus aureus*, a Gram-positive bacterium, which was inhibited by his mold. The student in this scenario, however, used an unknown bacterial species from the lab's general stock collection.\n\nWhich of the following choices provides the most fundamental and widespread biological reason that would explain why a randomly selected bacterial species might be completely unaffected by the penicillin produced by the mold?\n\nA. The bacterium is a Gram-negative species, whose outer membrane acts as a barrier, preventing penicillin from reaching the peptidoglycan layer.\nB. The bacterium possesses a beta-lactamase enzyme that specifically degrades the penicillin molecule before it can act.\nC. The bacterium is a species of *Mycoplasma*.\nD. The bacterium has altered its Penicillin-Binding Proteins (PBPs) through mutation, so they no longer bind to penicillin.\nE. The bacterium grew so much faster than the mold that the bacterial lawn was fully established before the mold could produce a significant concentration of penicillin.", "solution": "Penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics exert their activity by binding to Penicillin-Binding Proteins (PBPs) and inhibiting transpeptidation in peptidoglycan synthesis. Therefore, any explanation for lack of effect must address either absence of the target, failure of the drug to reach the target, or enzymatic inactivation of the drug.\n\nEvaluate each option by applying first principles and prevalence across randomly selected bacterial species:\n1) If the bacterium is Gram-negative, it possesses an outer membrane external to the peptidoglycan that acts as a permeability barrier; penicillin G in particular penetrates this barrier poorly due to limited transit through porins. This creates intrinsic resistance by preventing the drug from reaching PBPs in the periplasm. Because Gram-negatives constitute a large fraction of bacterial diversity and clinical isolates, this mechanism is both fundamental (structural, intrinsic) and widespread.\n2) Beta-lactamase production degrades penicillin before it can act, which would also cause complete lack of inhibition. However, while common, beta-lactamase presence is not as universal across randomly chosen species as the Gram-negative outer membrane barrier; furthermore, beta-lactamase is often acquired and varies widely among strains.\n3) Mycoplasma lack peptidoglycan entirely, so penicillin has no target and is completely ineffective. This is the most fundamental mechanism in terms of target absence, but it is not widespread; Mycoplasma represent a relatively small and specialized group, making this explanation unlikely for a random lab stock bacterium.\n4) Altered PBPs via mutation is a valid resistance mechanism (e.g., MRSA), but it is strain-specific, not inherently widespread across randomly selected species, and requires prior selection.\n5) Faster growth of the bacterium than the mold does not eliminate susceptibility; once penicillin diffuses, an inhibition zone would typically form at the interface if the bacterium is susceptible. Absence of any zone implies intrinsic resistance rather than merely growth kinetics.\n\nTherefore, the most fundamental and widespread biological reason among the choices for complete lack of inhibition by mold-produced penicillin in a randomly selected bacterium is the intrinsic permeability barrier of Gram-negative bacteria.\n\nThus, the best answer is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2062300"}, {"introduction": "A clear zone on a petri dish is a powerful qualitative sign, but developing a useful drug requires precise, quantitative measurement.

Define “no growth” as OD$_{600} < 0.050$ to capture “no visible turbidity,” without referencing the blank’s variance.
