It is therefore deemed **valid**. The solution will proceed.\n\nThe transmission of a monochromatic X-ray beam through a material of thickness $x$ is governed by the Beer–Lambert law:\n$$I = I_{0}\\exp(-\\mu x)$$\nwhere $I_{0}$ is the initial intensity, $I$ is the transmitted intensity, and $\\mu$ is the linear attenuation coefficient of the material.\n\nThe fraction of the initial intensity that is transmitted through the material is given by the ratio $\\frac{I}{I_{0}}$.\nFor the slab of cardboard, the transmitted intensity fraction is:\n$$T_{\\text{card}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{card}}}{I_{0}} = \\exp(-\\mu_{\\text{card}} x)$$\nFor the slab of aluminum, the transmitted intensity fraction is:\n$$T_{\\text{Al}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{Al}}}{I_{0}} = \\exp(-\\mu_{\\text{Al}} x)$$\n\nThe problem asks for the dimensionless ratio $\\mathcal{R}$ of the transmitted fraction through cardboard relative to that through aluminum.\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{T_{\\text{card}}}{T_{\\text{Al}}} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\mu_{\\text{card}} x)}{\\exp(-\\mu_{\\text{Al}} x)}$$\nUsing the property of exponential functions, $\\frac{\\exp(a)}{\\exp(b)} = \\exp(a-b)$, the expression for $\\mathcal{R}$ simplifies to:\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\exp(-\\mu_{\\text{card}} x - (-\\mu_{\\text{Al}} x)) = \\exp((\\mu_{\\text{Al}} - \\mu_{\\text{card}})x)$$\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Thickness: $x = 2\\,\\text{mm}$\n- Attenuation coefficients: $\\mu_{\\text{Al}} = 2.5\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and $\\mu_{\\text{card}} = 0.1\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$\n\nTo ensure dimensional consistency in the exponent, the thickness $x$ must be converted from millimeters to centimeters.\n$$x = 2\\,\\text{mm} = 0.2\\,\\text{cm}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into the expression for $\\mathcal{R}$.

To explain this connection, we analyze the physical meaning of the quantities involved. The linear attenuation coefficient $\\mu$ represents the probability per unit path length that a photon will be absorbed or scattered. It is strongly dependent on the material's density and atomic number ($Z$).\n\n1.  **High Penetration through Soft Materials:** Cardboard, being a low-density material composed of light elements (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen), is analogous to soft biological tissue. Its attenuation coefficient, $\\mu_{\\text{card}} = 0.1\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, is very small. The transmitted fraction through the $2\\,\\text{mm}$ cardboard slab is $T_{\\text{card}} = \\exp(-0.1 \\times 0.2) = \\exp(-0.02) \\approx 0.9802$. This means approximately $98\\%$ of the X-ray intensity passes through, confirming Röntgen's observation that the radiation \"passed readily through soft materials.\"\n\n2.  **Diagnostic Contrast relative to Denser Objects:** Aluminum serves as a proxy for denser substances like bone (rich in calcium) or metal objects. Its attenuation coefficient, $\\mu_{\\text{Al}} = 2.5\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, is $25$ times larger than that of cardboard. The transmitted fraction through the same thickness of aluminum is $T_{\\text{Al}} = \\exp(-2.5 \\times 0.2) = \\exp(-0.5) \\approx 0.6065$. Only about $61\\%$ of the intensity passes through.\n\nThe calculated ratio, $\\mathcal{R} \\approx 1.616$, signifies that the intensity of X-rays transmitted through the soft material (cardboard) is over $60\\%$ greater than the intensity transmitted through the denser material (aluminum). On a photographic plate, where exposure is proportional to the incident X-ray intensity, the area behind the cardboard would be significantly more exposed (darker) than the area behind the aluminum. This difference in exposure creates a visible \"shadow\" or contrast image. It is precisely this differential absorption, quantified by the large difference in $\\mu$ values and the resulting intensity ratio $\\mathcal{R} > 1$, that allows for the non-invasive visualization of internal structures, forming the basis of diagnostic radiology discovered by Röntgen.

An object with a sharp edge (for example, the cortical margin of bone) is placed at a distance $a$ from the source, and a photographic plate is placed a further distance $b$ beyond the object.

It describes the physical principle of geometric unsharpness in projection radiography using a standard model. The concept of penumbra arising from a finite-sized source is a fundamental topic in optics and imaging science. The model relies on the geometry of similar triangles, a valid mathematical approach under the stated assumption of straight-line propagation of X-rays. All necessary parameters ($s$, $a$, $b$) are clearly defined and assigned plausible numerical values for the historical context, allowing for a unique calculation of the penumbra width $p$. The problem is free of scientific inaccuracies, contradictions, and ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Penumbra Width\n\nThe penumbra width $p$ can be derived using the principle of similar triangles. Let us visualize the setup. The X-ray source has a width $s$. The object edge is at a distance $a$ from the source. The image detector (photographic plate) is at a distance $b$ from the object.\n\nConsider two triangles. Both triangles share a common apex at the sharp edge of the object.\n1. The first triangle is formed by the object's edge (apex) and the X-ray source (base). The height of this triangle is the source-to-object distance, $a$, and its base is the source diameter, $s$.\n2. The second triangle is formed by the object's edge (apex) and the penumbra projected onto the plate (base). The height of this triangle is the object-to-image distance, $b$, and its base is the penumbra width, $p$.\n\nBecause the rays travel in straight lines and the source plane is parallel to the image plane, these two triangles are similar. For similar triangles, the ratio of the base to the height is constant.\nTherefore, we can write the proportion:\n$$ \\frac{\\text{base}_1}{\\text{height}_1} = \\frac{\\text{base}_2}{\\text{height}_2} $$\n$$ \\frac{s}{a} = \\frac{p}{b} $$\nSolving for the penumbra width $p$, we get:\n$$ p = s \\cdot \\frac{b}{a} $$\nThis formula shows that the geometric unsharpness is directly proportional to the source size $s$ and the object-to-image distance $b$, and inversely proportional to the source-to-object distance $a$. The ratio $b/a$ is a component of the magnification factor for the penumbra.\n\nNow we can calculate the penumbra width for the given parameters: $s = 6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $a = 40\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, and $b = 10\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. We must ensure the units for $a$ and $b$ are consistent.\n$$ p = (6\\,\\mathrm{mm}) \\cdot \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{cm}}{40\\,\\mathrm{cm}} = 6\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The penumbra width $p$ arises from the finite separation of extreme rays emitted from the source that graze the object edge, and under the stated geometry equals $p=1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Increasing $s$ linearly increases $p$, which explains the visibly softened edges in early radiographs from tubes with poorly defined anticathode spots.**\n- The description of how the penumbra arises is physically correct.\n- The calculated value $p=1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ matches our derivation.\n- The formula $p = s \\cdot (b/a)$ shows a linear relationship between $p$ and $s$. Thus, increasing $s$ increases $p$, resulting in \"softened edges\". The historical note is also accurate; early X-ray tubes had large, unstable focal spots, leading to significant geometric unsharpness.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The penumbra width $p$ equals $s\\cdot\\frac{a+b}{a}$, so moving the object closer to the plate increases blur; for the given parameters, $p=7.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.**\n- The proposed formula $p = s\\cdot\\frac{a+b}{a}$ is incorrect. The term $\\frac{a+b}{a}$ is the formula for geometric magnification $M$, not the penumbra.\n- The statement \"moving the object closer to the plate increases blur\" is incorrect. Moving the object closer to the plate means decreasing $b$. According to the correct formula $p = s \\cdot (b/a)$, decreasing $b$ *decreases* the penumbra $p$, which *sharpens* the image.\n- The calculation based on the incorrect formula is $p = (6\\,\\mathrm{mm}) \\cdot \\frac{40\\,\\mathrm{cm}+10\\,\\mathrm{cm}}{40\\,\\mathrm{cm}} = 6 \\cdot \\frac{50}{40} = 7.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. While arithmetically sound for the given formula, the formula itself is wrong.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The edge blur in early radiographs was primarily a consequence of the inverse-square law for X-ray intensity, which reduces image contrast with distance but does not depend on the focal spot size $s$; hence edge sharpness is largely unaffected by $s$.**\n- The inverse-square law describes the falloff of radiation intensity with distance from a point source. It primarily affects image brightness and large-area contrast, not the geometric sharpness of an edge. Edge sharpness is determined by unsharpness components, the most significant here being the geometric unsharpness (penumbra).\n- The claim that edge sharpness is \"largely unaffected by $s$\" is false, as demonstrated by the formula $p = s \\cdot (b/a)$, which shows a direct, linear dependence.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The penumbra width $p$ equals $s\\cdot\\frac{b}{a+b}$; for the given parameters, $p=1.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The dominant cause of edge blur in early images was the grain size of the photographic emulsion, so reducing $s$ would have had little effect.**\n- The proposed formula $p = s\\cdot\\frac{b}{a+b}$ is incorrect.\n- The calculation based on this incorrect formula is $p = (6\\,\\mathrm{mm}) \\cdot \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{cm}}{40\\,\\mathrm{cm}+10\\,\\mathrm{cm}} = 6 \\cdot \\frac{10}{50} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. This numerical result is derived from a flawed premise.\n- The assertion that photographic grain size was the \"dominant\" cause of blur and that reducing $s$ would have \"little effect\" is physically unsubstantiated. While receptor unsharpness (from grain, etc.) is a factor, a calculated geometric unsharpness of $p=1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ is very large and would almost certainly be a dominant, if not the most dominant, factor in total image blur. Reducing $s$ would have a substantial effect.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. If tube design later reduced the anticathode spot to $s=2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ while keeping $a=40\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and $b=10\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, the penumbra width would drop to $p=0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, indicating why smaller, better-focused spots in improved tubes enhanced the diagnostic value of radiographs by sharpening cortical and fracture margins.**\n- Let's calculate the new penumbra width, $p'$, with $s' = 2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n$$ p' = s' \\cdot \\frac{b}{a} = (2\\,\\mathrm{mm}) \\cdot \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{cm}}{40\\,\\mathrm{cm}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\n- The calculated value of $p=0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ is correct.\n- The interpretation is also correct. Reducing the focal spot size from $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ to $2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ reduces the penumbra blur by a factor of $3$ (from $1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ to $0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$). This significant increase in sharpness is precisely why the development of tubes with smaller, more stable focal spots was a critical advance in radiology, improving the visibility of fine anatomical details like bone cortices and fractures.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "4767871"}, {"introduction": "The discovery of X-rays was quickly followed by the realization of their biological hazards, making radiation safety a paramount concern.
