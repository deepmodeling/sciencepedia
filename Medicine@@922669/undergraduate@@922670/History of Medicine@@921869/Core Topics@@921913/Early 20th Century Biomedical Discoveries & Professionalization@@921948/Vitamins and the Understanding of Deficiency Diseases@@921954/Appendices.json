That is, the rate of change of the concentration $C(t)$ obeys $dC/dt = -k(T)\\,C(t)$, where $k(T)$ is the temperature-dependent rate constant.\n- The temperature dependence of $k(T)$ for this reaction is well described by an Arrhenius relation characterized by an activation energy $E_a$ and a pre-exponential factor $A$.

Both processes are governed by first-order kinetics. The integrated form of the first-order rate law is $C(t) = C_{\\text{initial}} e^{-k(T)t}$.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the rate constants, $k_p$ for pasteurization and $k_s$ for storage, using the Arrhenius equation, $k(T) = A e^{-E_a/(RT)}$.\n\nFor pasteurization at $T_p = 358\\ \\text{K}$:\n$$\nk_p = k(T_p) = A e^{-E_a/(RT_p)} = (2.0 \\times 10^7\\ \\text{s}^{-1}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{8.0 \\times 10^4\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}}{(8.314\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}\\ \\text{K}^{-1})(358\\ \\text{K})}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nk_p \\approx (2.0 \\times 10^7\\ \\text{s}^{-1}) \\exp(-26.894) \\approx (2.0 \\times 10^7)(2.083 \\times 10^{-12})\\ \\text{s}^{-1} \\approx 4.166 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\nFor storage at $T_s = 298\\ \\text{K}$:\n$$\nk_s = k(T_s) = A e^{-E_a/(RT_s)} = (2.0 \\times 10^7\\ \\text{s}^{-1}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{8.0 \\times 10^4\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}}{(8.314\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}\\ \\text{K}^{-1})(298\\ \\text{K})}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nk_s \\approx (2.0 \\times 10^7\\ \\text{s}^{-1}) \\exp(-32.290) \\approx (2.0 \\times 10^7)(9.428 \\times 10^{-15})\\ \\text{s}^{-1} \\approx 1.886 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nNote the significant difference in reaction rates: $k_p/k_s \\approx 221$. The reaction is over $200$ times faster at the pasteurization temperature than at the storage temperature.\n\nNext, we calculate the concentration after each step.\n\n**Step 1: Pasteurization**\nThe initial concentration is $C_0 = 0.50\\ \\text{mg mL}^{-1}$. The pasteurization duration is $t_p = 1800\\ \\text{s}$.\nThe concentration after pasteurization, $C_p$, is:\n$$\nC_p = C_0 e^{-k_p t_p} = (0.50\\ \\text{mg mL}^{-1}) \\exp(-(4.166 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{s}^{-1})(1800\\ \\text{s}))\n$$\n$$\nC_p = (0.50\\ \\text{mg mL}^{-1}) e^{-0.07499} \\approx (0.50)(0.9277)\\ \\text{mg mL}^{-1} = 0.4639\\ \\text{mg mL}^{-1}\n$$\nThe loss during pasteurization is $C_0 - C_p = 0.50 - 0.4639 = 0.0361\\ \\text{mg mL}^{-1}$, which represents a loss of approximately $7.2\\%$.\n\n**Step 2: Storage**\nThe initial concentration for the storage period is $C_p = 0.4639\\ \\text{mg mL}^{-1}$. The storage duration is $t_s = 1.5552 \\times 10^7\\ \\text{s}$.\nThe final concentration after storage, $C_f$, is:\n$$\nC_f = C_p e^{-k_s t_s} = (0.4639\\ \\text{mg mL}^{-1}) \\exp(-(1.886 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{s}^{-1})(1.5552 \\times 10^7\\ \\text{s}))\n$$\n$$\nC_f = (0.4639\\ \\text{mg mL}^{-1}) e^{-2.933} \\approx (0.4639)(0.0532)\\ \\text{mg mL}^{-1} = 0.0247\\ \\text{mg mL}^{-1}\n$$\nThe loss during storage is $C_p - C_f = 0.4639 - 0.0247 = 0.4392\\ \\text{mg mL}^{-1}$.\n\n**Comparison of Losses**\nThe loss during pasteurization is $\\Delta C_p = 0.0361\\ \\text{mg mL}^{-1}$.\nThe loss during storage is $\\Delta C_s = 0.4392\\ \\text{mg mL}^{-1}$.\nThe total loss is $\\Delta C_{\\text{total}} = \\Delta C_p + \\Delta C_s = 0.4753\\ \\text{mg mL}^{-1}$.\nThe fraction of the total loss occurring during storage is $\\frac{0.4392}{0.4753} \\approx 0.924$, or $92.4\\%$.\nDespite the much slower rate constant, the prolonged duration of storage ($180\\ \\text{days}$) causes it to be the dominant step for ascorbate degradation.\n\n**Final Daily Intake Calculation**\nThe final concentration of ascorbate in the juice is $C_f = 0.0247\\ \\text{mg mL}^{-1}$.\nThe daily ration is $V_d = 150\\ \\text{mL}$.\nThe total daily intake of ascorbate, $I_d$, is:\n$$\nI_d = C_f \\times V_d = (0.0247\\ \\text{mg mL}^{-1})(150\\ \\text{mL}) = 3.705\\ \\text{mg}\n$$\nThe minimum daily intake required to prevent scurvy is $C_{\\min} = 10\\ \\text{mg day}^{-1}$.\nSince $I_d = 3.705\\ \\text{mg}  C_{\\min} = 10\\ \\text{mg}$, the daily ration is insufficient to prevent scurvy according to this model.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The preserved juice remains effective: pasteurization and storage together leave the daily ascorbate intake above $C_{\\min}$, so scurvy prevention should succeed.**\nOur calculation shows the daily intake is $3.705\\ \\text{mg}$, which is well below the required $10\\ \\text{mg}$. Therefore, the juice is not effective. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Pasteurization is the dominant loss: most ascorbate is destroyed during the $t_p$ at $T_p$, while storage at $T_s$ has negligible effect; nevertheless, the daily intake remains above $C_{\\min}$, so prevention should succeed.**\nThis statement makes two claims. First, that pasteurization is the dominant loss. Our calculation shows that storage accounts for over $92\\%$ of the total loss, so storage is the dominant factor, not pasteurization. Second, it claims the intake is sufficient. Our calculation shows it is insufficient. Both claims are false. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Combined heat and prolonged storage reduce the daily ascorbate intake below $C_{\\min}$, with long storage at $T_s$ causing the majority of loss; thus reliance on preserved juice without fresh supply would be predicted to fail, matching historical observations.**\nThis statement makes three claims. First, the intake is below $C_{\\min}$. Our calculation confirms this ($3.705\\ \\text{mg}  10\\ \\text{mg}$). Second, long storage causes the majority of the loss. Our analysis confirms this (storage accounts for $\\approx 92.4\\%$ of the degradation). Third, this predicts failure, matching history. This conclusion logically follows from the calculations. All parts of the statement are supported by the derived results. This statement is **Correct**.\n\n**D. Temperature has little influence on ascorbate degradation in citrus juice, so preservation can be assumed to retain potency; prevention failures must have arisen from non-nutritional causes.**\nThe Arrhenius model explicitly posits a strong exponential dependence on temperature. Our calculation of the rate constants $k_p$ and $k_s$ shows a difference of a factor of $\\approx 221$ between pasteurization and storage temperatures. This demonstrates a profound influence of temperature on the degradation rate. The premise of this option is fundamentally false according to the model used.
