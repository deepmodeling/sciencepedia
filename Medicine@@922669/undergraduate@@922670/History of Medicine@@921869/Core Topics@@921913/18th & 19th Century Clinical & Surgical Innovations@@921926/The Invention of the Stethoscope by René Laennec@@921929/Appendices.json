Model Laennec’s instrument as a uniform cylindrical air column of length $L$ whose one end is pressed against the chest (approximated as a rigid termination) and whose other end is open to the ear (approximated as an opening to ambient pressure). Assume the air in the column is an inviscid, compressible fluid supporting one-dimensional plane acoustic waves with propagation speed $c$. Losses, radiation effects, and end corrections are neglected.

This is a classic problem in acoustics involving the one-dimensional wave equation with mixed boundary conditions.\n\nThe governing equation for the pressure fluctuation $p(x,t)$ is given as the one-dimensional acoustic wave equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} p}{\\partial x^{2}} = \\frac{1}{c^{2}} \\frac{\\partial^{2} p}{\\partial t^{2}}\n$$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of sound in air. We seek standing-wave solutions, which can be found using the method of separation of variables. Let's assume a solution of the form $p(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the wave equation yields:\n$$\nX''(x)T(t) = \\frac{1}{c^{2}}X(x)T''(t)\n$$\nwhere primes denote differentiation with respect to the function's argument. Rearranging the terms to separate the variables gives:\n$$\n\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = \\frac{1}{c^{2}}\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)}\n$$\nSince the left side depends only on $x$ and the right side only on $t$, both must be equal to a constant. For oscillatory (wave-like) solutions, this constant must be negative. We denote it as $-k^{2}$, where $k$ is the wavenumber.\nThis yields two ordinary differential equations:\n$1$. The spatial equation: $X''(x) + k^{2}X(x) = 0$\n$2$. The temporal equation: $T''(t) + (kc)^{2}T(t) = 0$\n\nThe temporal equation has solutions of the form $T(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t) + B \\sin(\\omega t)$, where the angular frequency is $\\omega = kc$. The spatial equation has a general solution of the form:\n$$\nX(x) = C \\cos(kx) + D \\sin(kx)\n$$\nThus, the general solution for the pressure fluctuation is $p(x,t) = (C \\cos(kx) + D \\sin(kx)) T(t)$.\n\nNext, we must apply the boundary conditions. Let the chest end of the stethoscope be at $x=0$ and the open ear end be at $x=L$.\n-   **Boundary condition at the chest end ($x=0$):** This end is described as a \"rigid termination\". At a rigid, stationary wall, the longitudinal velocity of the air particles must be zero. In one-dimensional acoustics, the momentum equation relates pressure gradient to particle velocity $u$ by $\\rho_0 \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}$. If $u(0,t)=0$ for all $t$, then its time derivative is also zero, which implies that the pressure gradient must be zero at this boundary: $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x=0} = 0$. This condition defines a pressure antinode.\n-   **Boundary condition at the ear end ($x=L$):** This end is approximated as an \"opening to ambient pressure\". At an ideal open end, the pressure fluctuation relative to the ambient pressure is zero. Therefore, $p(L,t)=0$. This condition defines a pressure node.\n\nWe now apply these two conditions to our solution $p(x,t) = (C \\cos(kx) + D \\sin(kx)) T(t)$.\n\nFirst, apply the condition at $x=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = (-Ck \\sin(kx) + Dk \\cos(kx)) T(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x=0} = (-Ck \\sin(0) + Dk \\cos(0)) T(t) = (0 + Dk)T(t) = DkT(t)\n$$\nFor this to be zero for all $t$ in a non-trivial case (where $k \\neq 0$ and $T(t)$ is not identically zero), we must have $D=0$. This simplifies the spatial part of the solution to $X(x) = C \\cos(kx)$.\n\nNow, apply the condition at $x=L$:\n$$\np(L,t) = X(L)T(t) = C \\cos(kL) T(t) = 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution, $C$ cannot be zero. Thus, we must have:\n$$\n\\cos(kL) = 0\n$$\nThis equation is satisfied when the argument $kL$ is an odd integer multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n$$\nkL = n\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{2}, \\quad \\text{for } n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots\n$$\nThis gives the allowed wavenumbers $k_n$:\n$$\nk_n = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{2L}\n$$\nThe corresponding allowed angular frequencies are $\\omega_n = k_n c$. The ordinary frequencies $f_n$ are related by $\\omega_n = 2\\pi f_n$.\n$$\n2\\pi f_n = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi c}{2L}\n$$\nSolving for $f_n$, we find the allowed standing-wave frequencies:\n$$\nf_n = \\frac{(2n+1)c}{4L}, \\quad \\text{for } n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots\n$$\nThis formula shows that the resonant frequencies are the fundamental frequency ($n=0$) and its odd harmonics.\n\nTo compute the fundamental resonance frequency, we set $n=0$:\n$$\nf_0 = \\frac{c}{4L}\n$$\nUsing the provided values $L = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and $c = 343\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$:\n$$\nf_0 = \\frac{343\\,\\mathrm{m/s}}{4 \\times 0.25\\,\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{343}{1}\\,\\mathrm{Hz} = 343\\,\\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\nThe result $343$ is already expressed to three significant figures.\n\nFinally, we analyze the influence of this resonance on the audibility of cardiac murmurs in the $100$–$200\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ band. The stethoscope, modeled as an acoustic tube, acts as a filter. It does not transmit all frequencies equally; instead, it preferentially amplifies sounds near its resonant frequencies. Our derivation shows that the fundamental resonance of the modeled stethoscope is $f_0 = 343\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. The next resonance (the third harmonic) is $f_1 = 3 f_0 = 3 \\times 343\\,\\mathrm{Hz} = 1029\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nThe target band for cardiac murmurs is specified as $100$–$200\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. This frequency range lies significantly below the stethoscope's fundamental resonance frequency of $343\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. An acoustic system's response is greatest at resonance and falls off for frequencies away from resonance. Therefore, the stethoscope would transmit sounds in the $100$–$200\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ band less efficiently than it transmits sounds near $343\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. This implies that Laennec's instrument, while revolutionary for isolating sounds from the chest, would have functioned as a high-pass filter for frequencies below its fundamental resonance. It would not have amplified, and may have even attenuated, low-frequency cardiac murmurs in the $100$–$200\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ range relative to sounds with frequency components closer to $343\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. In historical clinical practice, this inherent acoustic filtering behavior means that the instrument was not a neutral sound conduit but an active shaper of the perceived clinical soundscape, potentially making certain low-frequency heart sounds more difficult to diagnose than higher-frequency ones.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{343}\n$$", "id": "4774798"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the physics of the instrument to the logic of its application, this exercise explores how the stethoscope transformed diagnostic reasoning.

The problem states that we must use the partitioning of the sample space into $D$ and its complement, $\\neg D$. According to the law of total probability, we can express $P(S)$ as the sum of probabilities of detecting sounds in the sub-populations with and without pneumonia:\n$$P(S) = P(S \\cap D) + P(S \\cap \\neg D)$$\nWe have already found an expression for $P(S \\cap D)$. Similarly, for the second term, we use the definition of conditional probability for $P(S \\mid \\neg D)$:\n$$P(S \\cap \\neg D) = P(S \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D)$$\nThe probability of a patient not having pneumonia, $P(\\neg D)$, is the complement of the prevalence $P(D)$:\n$$P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D)$$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the equation for $P(S)$:\n$$P(S) = P(S \\mid D) P(D) + P(S \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D)$$\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for the numerator $P(D \\cap S)$ and the denominator $P(S)$ back into our original formula for $P(D \\mid S)$:\n$$P(D \\mid S) = \\frac{P(S \\mid D) P(D)}{P(S \\mid D) P(D) + P(S \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D)}$$\nThis is the formal expression of Bayes' theorem for this problem.

It is scientifically grounded in the field of biostatistics, specifically concerning the measurement of interobserver reliability, a critical aspect of clinical research and practice.

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data ($P_o$ and $P_e$) to compute the requested statistic, Cohen's kappa ($\\kappa$). The values provided are realistic and the question is objective and unambiguous.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of Cohen's kappa coefficient, $\\kappa$, a statistical measure of inter-rater agreement for categorical items that corrects for the probability of agreement occurring by chance. The fundamental definition of $\\kappa$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\kappa = \\frac{P_o - P_e}{1 - P_e} $$\nwhere $P_o$ is the observed proportion of agreement between the two observers, and $P_e$ is the expected proportion of agreement that would occur by chance.

Therefore, $\\kappa$ expresses the proportion of the achievable agreement beyond chance that was actually observed.

In the context of standardizing a diagnostic method like auscultation, a kappa of $0.6$ suggests that the two observers are achieving a level of agreement that is substantially better than random chance. It provides evidence that the standardized protocol is useful for achieving reliability. However, it also indicates that the agreement is not perfect and that a considerable amount of disagreement (40% of the opportunities for agreement not accounted for by chance) still exists between the observers.
