Hematocrit ($Hct$) is the ratio of red blood cell volume ($V_{\\mathrm{RBC}}$) to total blood volume, $Hct = V_{\\mathrm{RBC}}/BV$.\n\nWe will compute the two required values in sequence.\n\n**1. Volume of Blood Removed ($V_{\\mathrm{removed}}$)**\n\nFirst, we calculate the patient's initial estimated total blood volume, denoted as $BV_{0}$. Using the provided formula:\n$$BV_{0} = v_{s}m$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$BV_{0} = (70\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg}) \\times (70\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 4900\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nThe volume of blood removed, $V_{\\mathrm{removed}}$, is a specified fraction $f$ of this initial blood volume:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{removed}} = f \\times BV_{0}$$\nSubstituting the values for $f$ and $BV_{0}$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{removed}} = 0.15 \\times 4900\\,\\mathrm{mL} = 735\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nThus, the volume of blood removed is $735\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\n**2. Post-Bleed Hematocrit ($Hct_{\\mathrm{post}}$)**\n\nNext, we calculate the new hematocrit after the procedure.

Assuming uniform mixing, the concentration of red blood cells in the removed blood is equal to the initial hematocrit, $Hct_{0}$. Therefore, the volume of red blood cells removed, $V_{\\mathrm{RBC,removed}}$, is:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{RBC,removed}} = Hct_{0} \\times V_{\\mathrm{removed}}$$\n\nThe final volume of red blood cells is the initial volume minus the removed volume:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{RBC,final}} = V_{\\mathrm{RBC},0} - V_{\\mathrm{RBC,removed}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $V_{\\mathrm{RBC},0}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{RBC,removed}}$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{RBC,final}} = (Hct_{0} \\times BV_{0}) - (Hct_{0} \\times V_{\\mathrm{removed}})$$\nWe can factor out $Hct_{0}$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{RBC,final}} = Hct_{0} \\times (BV_{0} - V_{\\mathrm{removed}})$$\nSince $V_{\\mathrm{removed}} = f \\times BV_{0}$, we can write:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{RBC,final}} = Hct_{0} \\times (BV_{0} - f \\times BV_{0}) = Hct_{0} \\times BV_{0} \\times (1 - f)$$\n\nNow, let's determine the final blood volume, $BV_{\\mathrm{final}}$. The problem states that the removed volume is replaced \"isovolemically\" with a crystalloid solution.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution is determined in two main parts, corresponding to the two tasks given in the problem.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Total Water and Electrolyte Losses**\n\nFirst, we calculate the total mass of the stools produced.\n$m_{\\text{stools, total}} = N_{\\text{stools}} \\times m_{\\text{stool}} = 8 \\times 320\\,\\mathrm{g} = 2560\\,\\mathrm{g}$\n\nNext, we determine the mass of water within these stools using the given water fraction.\n$m_{\\text{water, loss}} = m_{\\text{stools, total}} \\times f_{\\text{water}} = 2560\\,\\mathrm{g} \\times 0.90 = 2304\\,\\mathrm{g}$\n\nTo find the volume of water lost, we convert the mass to kilograms and use the provided density.\n$m_{\\text{water, loss}} = 2304\\,\\mathrm{g} = 2.304\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\nThe volume of water lost, $V_{\\text{loss}}$, is:\n$V_{\\text{loss}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{water, loss}}}{\\rho_{\\text{water}}} = \\frac{2.304\\,\\mathrm{kg}}{1.0\\,\\mathrm{kg/L}} = 2.304\\,\\mathrm{L}$\n\nThe total losses of sodium, potassium, and chloride are found by multiplying their respective concentrations in the stool water by the total volume of water lost.\n- Sodium loss: $n_{\\text{Na, loss}} = [\\text{Na}^+]_{\\text{stool}} \\times V_{\\text{loss}} = 90\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L} \\times 2.304\\,\\mathrm{L} = 207.36\\,\\mathrm{mmol}$\n- Potassium loss: $n_{\\text{K, loss}} = [\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{stool}} \\times V_{\\text{loss}} = 30\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L} \\times 2.304\\,\\mathrm{L} = 69.12\\,\\mathrm{mmol}$\n- Chloride loss: $n_{\\text{Cl, loss}} = [\\text{Cl}^-]_{\\text{stool}} \\times V_{\\text{loss}} = 80\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L} \\times 2.304\\,\\mathrm{L} = 184.32\\,\\mathrm{mmol}$\n\nThese results complete the first task. The crucial value for the second task is the total volume of water lost, $V_{\\text{loss}} = 2.304\\,\\mathrm{L}$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Hypovolemia Risk Index R**\n\nFirst, we establish the initial volumes of the relevant fluid compartments for the $70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ subject.\n- Total Body Water: $V_{\\text{TBW}} = 0.60 \\times 70\\,\\mathrm{kg} = 42\\,\\mathrm{L}$\n- Extracellular Fluid: $V_{\\text{ECF, initial}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times V_{\\text{TBW}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 42\\,\\mathrm{L} = 14\\,\\mathrm{L}$\n- Plasma Volume: $V_{\\text{Plasma, initial}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times V_{\\text{ECF, initial}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 14\\,\\mathrm{L} = 3.5\\,\\mathrm{L}$\n\nThe problem states that the purge produces an isotonic fluid loss from the Extracellular Fluid (ECF). This means the entire fluid volume lost, $V_{\\text{loss}}$, is removed from the ECF compartment. The total decrease in ECF volume is therefore $\\Delta V_{\\text{ECF}} = V_{\\text{loss}} = 2.304\\,\\mathrm{L}$.\n\nThe problem also states there is \"rapid equilibration within the ECF\". The ECF is composed of plasma and interstitial fluid. This assumption implies that the volume loss is distributed proportionally across these sub-compartments. Therefore, the fractional decrease in plasma volume will be equal to the fractional decrease in the total ECF volume.\n\nThe hypovolemia risk index, $R$, is defined as the fractional decrease in plasma volume:\n$R = \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{Plasma}}}{V_{\\text{Plasma, initial}}}$\n\nDue to the proportional loss from the ECF, we can state:\n$\\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{Plasma}}}{V_{\\text{Plasma, initial}}} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{ECF}}}{V_{\\text{ECF, initial}}}$\n\nTherefore, the risk index $R$ can be calculated directly as the total volume of fluid lost divided by the initial ECF volume.\n$R = \\frac{V_{\\text{loss}}}{V_{\\text{ECF, initial}}}$\n\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$R = \\frac{2.304\\,\\mathrm{L}}{14\\,\\mathrm{L}}$\n$R \\approx 0.164571428...$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$R \\approx 0.1646$\nThis corresponds to a $16.46\\%$ decrease in plasma volume, a significant level of hypovolemia.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1646}$$", "id": "4740824"}, {"introduction": "While historical practitioners often applied bloodletting indiscriminately, modern clinical science provides a clear rationale for why this practice is exceptionally dangerous for specific patient populations.
