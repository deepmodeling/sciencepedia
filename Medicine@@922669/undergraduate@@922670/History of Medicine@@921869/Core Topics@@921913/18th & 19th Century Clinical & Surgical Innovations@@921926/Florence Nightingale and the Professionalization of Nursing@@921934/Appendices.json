Assume that causes are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive for deaths, and that the appropriate denominator for a mortality proportion in this setting is the total number of admissions. Using the foundational epidemiological definition that the mortality proportion for a specified cause equals the number of deaths from that cause divided by the total admissions, treat “infectious disease” as the aggregation of cholera, typhus, and dysentery and “wounds” as its own category.

The historical context provided by Florence Nightingale's work is appropriate, as she was a pioneer in using statistical data to advocate for public health reforms. All data and definitions required for a solution are explicitly provided. The definitions of \"mortality proportion\", \"infectious disease\", and \"wounds\" are clear and unambiguous. The data are internally consistent; the total number of deaths ($80 + 120 + 100 + 70 = 370$) is less than the total number of admissions ($1000$), which is a logical necessity. Thus, the problem is well-posed and admits a unique, meaningful solution.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe problem requires the calculation of a ratio of two mortality proportions. We will derive each proportion from first principles as defined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of deaths attributable to \"infectious disease\". This category is defined as the aggregation of deaths from cholera, typhus, and dysentery. Since the causes of death are stated to be mutually exclusive, the total count is the sum of the individual counts. Let $D_{\\text{id}}$ be the number of deaths from infectious disease.\n$$D_{\\text{id}} = D_{\\text{chol}} + D_{\\text{typh}} + D_{\\text{dys}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$D_{\\text{id}} = 80 + 120 + 100 = 300$$\n\nNext, we use the provided definition of mortality proportion. The mortality proportion for a specified cause is the number of deaths from that cause divided by the total number of admissions, $N_{\\text{adm}}$.\n\nThe infectious-disease mortality proportion, denoted as $P_{\\text{id}}$, is:\n$$P_{\\text{id}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{id}}}{N_{\\text{adm}}} = \\frac{300}{1000} = 0.3$$\n\nThe wounds mortality proportion, denoted as $P_{\\text{wounds}}$, is based on the given number of deaths from wounds, $D_{\\text{wounds}} = 70$.\n$$P_{\\text{wounds}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{wounds}}}{N_{\\text{adm}}} = \\frac{70}{1000} = 0.07$$\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the infectious-disease mortality proportion to the wounds mortality proportion. Let this ratio be $R$.\n$$R = \\frac{P_{\\text{id}}}{P_{\\text{wounds}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the proportions:\n$$R = \\frac{\\frac{D_{\\text{id}}}{N_{\\text{adm}}}}{\\frac{D_{\\text{wounds}}}{N_{\\text{adm}}}}$$\nThe term for total admissions, $N_{\\text{adm}}$, cancels, simplifying the ratio to the ratio of the death counts for the two categories:\n$$R = \\frac{D_{\\text{id}}}{D_{\\text{wounds}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated and given values for the number of deaths:\n$$R = \\frac{300}{70} = \\frac{30}{7}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of the ratio and round it to four significant figures as requested.\n$$R = \\frac{30}{7} \\approx 4.28571428...$$\nTo round this to four significant figures, we examine the first five digits: $4.2857$. Since the fifth digit ($7$) is $5$ or greater, we round up the fourth significant digit ($5$).\n$$R \\approx 4.286$$\nThis is the final answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.286}$$", "id": "4745449"}, {"introduction": "Once a problem has been identified, the next logical step is to measure the effectiveness of the proposed solution. This exercise challenges you to quantify the large-scale impact of the sanitary and nursing reforms associated with Nightingale's program. By calculating the expected number of \"deaths avoided\" given a reduction in mortality risk, you will grasp how probabilistic reasoning can be used to estimate the human-scale benefits of systemic public health interventions [@problem_id:4745375].", "problem": "Florence Nightingale’s statistical work during the Crimean War drew on basic probabilistic reasoning: if each soldier faces a mortality risk from disease over a defined period, then in a large cohort the expected number of deaths is the sum of those individual risks. Consider a cohort of $20{,}000$ soldiers observed over a comparable period before and after the introduction of sanitation and professionalized nursing reforms. Suppose the pre-commission disease mortality risk is $0.17$ per soldier over the period, and the post-reform disease mortality risk is $0.06$ per soldier over the period. Starting only from the definition that, for independent and identically distributed Bernoulli outcomes with per-individual probability $p$, the expected total count in a cohort of size $n$ equals the sum of individual expectations, derive an expression for the expected number of deaths avoided in the cohort when the risk changes from $p_0$ to $p_1$, and then compute this value using $p_0=0.17$, $p_1=0.06$, and $n=20{,}000$. Express your final answer as a number of deaths. Provide the numeric result as an exact integer (no rounding). After computing the number, briefly state in your reasoning why this estimate, while useful for historical inference about reforms associated with Florence Nightingale’s program, has limits for causal attribution; however, your final reported answer must be the single computed number of avoided deaths.", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no disqualifying flaws.\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation of the expected number of deaths avoided and its computation based on provided data. We begin by formalizing the situation using the principles of probability theory.\n\nLet the outcome for an individual soldier be represented by a Bernoulli random variable, $X_i$, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $n$, the total number of soldiers in the cohort. We define $X_i=1$ if the $i$-th soldier dies from disease and $X_i=0$ if the soldier survives. The problem states that the mortality risk, or the probability of death for a single soldier, is $p$. Thus, we have the probability mass function for each soldier:\n$$ P(X_i=1) = p $$\n$$ P(X_i=0) = 1-p $$\n\nThe expected value of a single Bernoulli random variable $X_i$ is, by definition:\n$$ E[X_i] = (1 \\cdot P(X_i=1)) + (0 \\cdot P(X_i=0)) = (1 \\cdot p) + (0 \\cdot (1-p)) = p $$\n\nThe total number of deaths in the cohort, $D$, is the sum of the outcomes for all $n$ soldiers:\n$$ D = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i $$\n\nThe expected total number of deaths, $E[D]$, is the expected value of this sum. The problem specifies that we should use the property that the expected total count is the sum of individual expectations. This is a direct application of the linearity of expectation:\n$$ E[D] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_i] $$\n\nSince the soldiers' outcomes are described as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), the expected value for each soldier is the same, $E[X_i] = p$. Therefore, the sum becomes:\n$$ E[D] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p = n \\cdot p $$\n\nThis general expression gives the expected number of deaths in a cohort of size $n$ where each individual has a mortality risk of $p$.\n\nWe are given two scenarios: pre-reform and post-reform. Let $p_0$ be the pre-reform mortality risk and $p_1$ be the post-reform mortality risk.\nThe expected number of deaths pre-reform, $E[D_0]$, is:\n$$ E[D_0] = n \\cdot p_0 $$\nThe expected number of deaths post-reform, $E[D_1]$, is:\n$$ E[D_1] = n \\cdot p_1 $$\n\nThe expected number of deaths avoided is the difference between the expected number of deaths before the reforms and the expected number of deaths after the reforms. Let this quantity be denoted by $\\Delta E$.\n$$ \\Delta E = E[D_0] - E[D_1] $$\n\nSubstituting the expressions we derived:\n$$ \\Delta E = n \\cdot p_0 - n \\cdot p_1 $$\nFactoring out the cohort size $n$, we obtain the desired general expression for the expected number of deaths avoided:\n$$ \\Delta E = n(p_0 - p_1) $$\n\nNow, we compute this value using the data provided in the problem statement:\n- Cohort size, $n = 20,000$.\n- Pre-reform mortality risk, $p_0 = 0.17$.\n- Post-reform mortality risk, $p_1 = 0.06$.\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived expression:\n$$ \\Delta E = 20,000 \\cdot (0.17 - 0.06) $$\n$$ \\Delta E = 20,000 \\cdot (0.11) $$\n$$ \\Delta E = 2,200 $$\n\nThus, the expected number of deaths avoided in the cohort is $2,200$.\n\nFinally, we address the limits of this estimate for causal attribution. The calculation demonstrates a strong statistical association (a correlation) between the sanitary and nursing reforms and the substantial reduction in the expected mortality rate. However, correlation does not imply causation. To attribute the reduction in deaths solely to Nightingale's reforms would be to assume they were the only relevant factor that changed between the two observation periods. This is a strong and likely oversimplified assumption in a complex historical context like a war. Other factors, known as confounding variables, could have contributed to the observed outcome. Examples of such confounders include:\n1.  Changes in the intensity or nature of the conflict, which might affect the baseline health and injury rates of soldiers.\n2.  Improvements in nutrition or supply lines unrelated to the specific sanitary reforms.\n3.  The natural progression of epidemics, which can have their own cycles of waxing and waning.\n4.  Seasonal effects, as mortality from disease often varies significantly with the time of year.\nWithout a controlled experimental design where a treated group (receiving reforms) is compared simultaneously to an untreated control group (not receiving reforms), it is impossible to definitively isolate the effect of the reforms from other co-occurring changes. Therefore, while the statistical analysis provides powerful circumstantial evidence for the effectiveness of Nightingale's program, it is not, by itself, conclusive proof of a causal link.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{2200} $$", "id": "4745375"}, {"introduction": "The previous exercise [@problem_id:4745375] demonstrated a dramatic drop in mortality following reforms, but a critical thinker must always ask: can we be certain the reforms were the cause?

By dissecting the strengths and weaknesses of different observational study designs, you will learn to identify potential confounding factors and appreciate the crucial distinction between correlation and causation, a skill essential for evaluating any claim of evidence-based practice [@problem_id:4745431].", "problem": "Florence Nightingale used two broad observational strategies to assess the impact of sanitary reforms during the Crimean War: comparing outcomes before and after reforms within the same hospitals, and making contemporaneous controlled comparisons across hospitals or wards with and without reforms. Consider a simplified causal framework in which each unit (for example, a ward) has potential outcomes $Y(1)$ if exposed to the reform and $Y(0)$ if not, with the observed outcome $Y = D \\cdot Y(1) + (1-D) \\cdot Y(0)$ where $D \\in \\{0,1\\}$ indicates exposure. The average causal effect is the quantity $\\mathbb{E}[Y(1) - Y(0)]$. In Nightingale’s context, reforms were introduced at time $t_0$ in some wards earlier than others, mortality $Y$ varied seasonally, and case mix and measurement practices could shift over time.\n\nStarting from the counterfactual definition of causal effect and basic principles of observational inference, reason about what each comparison holds constant and what it leaves vulnerable. In a before–after comparison within the same ward, the pre-period at time $t < t_0$ with $D=0$ is contrasted with the post-period at time $t \\ge t_0$ with $D=1$.

Contemporaneous controlled comparisons: Comparing outcomes across hospitals or wards with and without reforms at the same time.\n-   **Causal Framework:**\n    -   Potential Outcomes: $Y(1)$ for outcome with reform, $Y(0)$ for outcome without reform.\n    -   Observed Outcome: $Y = D \\cdot Y(1) + (1-D) \\cdot Y(0)$.\n    -   Treatment Indicator: $D \\in \\{0,1\\}$, where $D=1$ indicates exposure to the reform.\n    -   Causal Estimand: Average Causal Effect (ACE), $\\mathbb{E}[Y(1) - Y(0)]$.\n-   **Contextual Factors:**\n    -   Reforms were introduced at time $t_0$.\n    -   Mortality ($Y$) exhibited seasonal variation.\n    -   Case mix and measurement practices could change over time.\n-   **Strategy Formalization:**\n    1.  **Before–after comparison:** For a single unit, contrast the outcome in a pre-period ($t < t_0, D=0$) with the outcome in a post-period ($t \\ge t_0, D=1$).\n    2.  **Controlled comparison:** At the same time $t$, contrast a unit with $D=1$ and a unit with $D=0$, ideally matched on observable characteristics.\n-   **Question:** Identify (i) the fundamental difference in what each strategy holds constant, and (ii) the main threats to valid causal inference for each.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is a standard, well-formulated question in the field of causal inference, using a historical example as its setting.\n-   **Scientifically Grounded (Critical):** Yes. The problem is based on the potential outcomes framework (Neyman-Rubin causal model), which is a cornerstone of modern causal inference in statistics, econometrics, and epidemiology. The threats mentioned (seasonality, confounding, selection bias) are standard and valid concerns in observational studies.\n-   **Well-Posed:** Yes. The problem is clearly structured, defining two distinct methodologies and asking for a comparative analysis of their assumptions and vulnerabilities. A unique, correct answer based on established principles of epidemiology and statistics exists.\n-   **Objective (Critical):** Yes. The language is precise, using standard technical terms like `potential outcomes`, `confounding`, `selection bias`, and `secular trends`. It is free of subjective or value-laden statements.\n-   The problem is not incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, ill-posed, or trivial. It presents a classic trade-off in observational study design.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. Proceeding to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe objective is to estimate the Average Causal Effect (ACE), $\\mathbb{E}[Y(1) - Y(0)]$. In observational studies, we typically estimate this with the difference in observed means, $\\mathbb{E}[Y|D=1] - \\mathbb{E}[Y|D=0]$. Using the law of total expectation and the definition of observed outcomes, this difference can be expanded as:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y|D=1] - \\mathbb{E}[Y|D=0] = \\mathbb{E}[Y(1)|D=1] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(0)|D=0]\n$$\nThis observed difference is equal to the ACE, $\\mathbb{E}[Y(1)] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(0)]$, only if certain assumptions hold. The key assumption is exchangeability (or unconfoundedness): that the treated and control groups are comparable, such that $\\mathbb{E}[Y(0)|D=1] = \\mathbb{E}[Y(0)|D=0]$ and $\\mathbb{E}[Y(1)|D=1] = \\mathbb{E}[Y(1)|D=0]$. Let us analyze each strategy with respect to this requirement.\n\n**1. Before–After Comparison**\nThis strategy compares outcomes within the same unit $i$ at two different times, $t_1 < t_0$ (where $D=0$) and $t_2 \\ge t_0$ (where $D=1$). The estimator is based on $Y_{i,t_2} - Y_{i,t_1}$, which corresponds to $Y_{i,t_2}(1) - Y_{i,t_1}(0)$.\n\n-   **What is held constant?** The unit $i$. By using the same ward as its own control, this design holds constant all stable, time-invariant characteristics of that ward. This includes fixed physical infrastructure, geographic location, and other unchanging properties.\n-   **What is not held constant?** Calendar time. The comparison is made across two distinct time points, $t_1$ and $t_2$.\n-   **Threats to Validity:** The implicit assumption is that the potential outcome under no treatment is stable over time, i.e., $\\mathbb{E}[Y_{i,t_2}(0)] = \\mathbb{E}[Y_{i,t_1}(0)]$. If we observe a change, we assume it is due to the treatment. This \"ceteris paribus\" assumption is violated by any factor that changes over time and also affects the outcome. The problem statement itself lists several such factors:\n    -   **Secular trends:** General changes in mortality over time due to factors unrelated to the reform (e.g., discovery of other treatments, general improvement in medical knowledge).\n    -   **Seasonality:** Mortality rates naturally fluctuate with the seasons. A comparison between a pre-reform winter and a post-reform summer would be severely confounded.\n    -   **Shifts in case mix:** The type and severity of patients being admitted may change over time.\n    -   **Changes in measurement:** Diagnostic practices or the administrative process of recording deaths might have changed between $t_1$ and $t_2$.\n    -   **History:** Other specific events may have occurred between the pre- and post-periods that influence the outcome.\n\n**2. Contemporaneous Controlled Comparison**\nThis strategy compares two different units, unit $i$ (treated, $D=1$) and unit $j$ (control, $D=0$), at the same point in time, $t$. The estimator is based on $Y_{i,t} - Y_{j,t}$, which corresponds to $Y_{i,t}(1) - Y_{j,t}(0)$.\n\n-   **What is held constant?** Calendar time $t$. By comparing two units at the same moment, this design holds constant all time-varying factors that affect both units, such as seasonality, secular trends at time $t$, and any widespread historical event.\n-   **What is not held constant?** The unit. The comparison is made across two distinct units, $i$ and $j$.\n-   **Threats to Validity:** The implicit assumption is that the units are exchangeable, i.e., the control unit $j$ is a valid counterfactual for the treated unit $i$. Formally, $\\mathbb{E}[Y_i(0)] = \\mathbb{E}[Y_j(0)]$. This is the standard unconfoundedness assumption. It is violated if the selection into treatment ($D=1$) is correlated with the potential outcomes. This is known as **confounding by indication** or **selection bias**. Specific sources include:\n    -   **Non-equivalent groups:** Wards might be different in fundamental ways. Reforms may have been implemented in wards with the worst (or best) initial conditions, best staff, or different patient populations.\n    -   **Differences in case mix, baseline severity, etc.:** Even if wards seem similar, their patient populations may differ systematically in ways that affect mortality.\n    -   **Incomplete adjustment:** The problem states the units are \"ideally matched on observable characteristics.\" However, matching can only account for confounding by the variables used for matching. Any unobserved or unmeasured differences between the units that affect mortality will remain as sources of bias.\n\n**Conclusion of Analysis:** Before-after studies hold the unit constant but are vulnerable to time-varying confounders. Contemporaneous controlled studies hold time constant but are vulnerable to confounding due to differences between units (selection bias).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Before–after comparisons use the time series to automatically control for seasonality, thereby eliminating secular trends; their primary remaining threat is selection bias, while contemporaneous controlled comparisons are mainly threatened by regression to the mean because they do not use time information.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A simple before-after comparison does not control for seasonality or secular trends; on the contrary, it is highly susceptible to them. Selection bias is the quintessential threat to contemporaneous comparisons, not before-after designs.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Before–after comparisons treat time as an instrumental variable that guarantees exogeneity; their main threats are reverse causation and placebo effects, while contemporaneous controlled comparisons, if matched on observed factors, remove confounding and face only measurement error as a residual threat.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Time is not a valid instrumental variable in this context because it is correlated with numerous other factors affecting the outcome (e.g., seasonality), thus violating the exclusion restriction. The claim that matching on observed factors removes confounding is far too strong; confounding by unobservables is a major residual threat.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Before–after comparisons hold unit-level characteristics (for example, ward infrastructure) fixed while changing $D$ over time, but do not hold time-varying influences constant; they are threatened by secular trends, seasonality, shifts in case mix, changes in diagnostic and recording practices, and other time-varying confounders. Contemporaneous controlled comparisons hold calendar time fixed by contrasting $D=1$ versus $D=0$ at the same $t$, but risk confounding from non-equivalent groups due to selection into treatment, differences in case mix, baseline severity, referral and allocation practices, and incomplete adjustment by matching.**\nThis statement provides a precise and accurate summary of the analysis derived above. It correctly identifies what is held constant in each design (the unit in before-after; time in contemporaneous). It then accurately enumerates the principal threats to validity for each: time-varying confounders for the before-after design, and confounding from non-equivalent groups (selection bias) for the contemporaneous design, providing appropriate examples for both.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Both before–after and contemporaneous controlled comparisons produce unbiased estimates of $\\mathbb{E}[Y(1) - Y(0)]$ so long as the sample size is sufficiently large; threats to inference are negligible beyond sampling variability in Nightingale’s setting.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. Large sample sizes reduce variance (sampling error), but do not correct for bias (systematic error). Confounding and selection bias are sources of systematic error. In an observational study with inherent biases, a larger sample size will simply yield a more precise estimate of the wrong quantity. The threats to inference in observational studies are typically substantial and are the primary challenge to be addressed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4745431"}]}
