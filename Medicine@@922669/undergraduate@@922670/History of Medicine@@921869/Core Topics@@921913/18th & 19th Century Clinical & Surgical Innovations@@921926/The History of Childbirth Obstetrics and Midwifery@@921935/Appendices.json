The mortality rates given are historically plausible for the era. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: All necessary data and definitions are provided to calculate the two requested quantities. The problem is self-contained and admits a unique, stable solution. The questions are unambiguous.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in quantitative and objective terms, free from subjective language or opinion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a straightforward application of epidemiological definitions. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nLet $R_{\\text{pre}}$ denote the risk of maternal mortality before the adoption of antisepsis and $R_{\\text{post}}$ denote the risk after the adoption. Let $N$ be the number of births in the cohort.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n- $R_{\\text{pre}} = 7\\% = \\frac{7}{100} = 0.07$\n- $R_{\\text{post}} = 2\\% = \\frac{2}{100} = 0.02$\n- $N = 2,000$\n\n**1) Absolute Risk Reduction**\n\nThe absolute risk reduction, denoted as $ARR$, is defined as the arithmetic difference between the risk in the unexposed (or control) group and the risk in the exposed (or intervention) group. In this context, the \"unexposed\" group corresponds to the pre-antisepsis condition, and the \"exposed\" group corresponds to the post-antisepsis condition.\n\nThe problem asks for the absolute reduction in risk, which is calculated as:\n$$ARR = R_{\\text{pre}} - R_{\\text{post}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ARR = 0.07 - 0.02 = 0.05$$\nThis value represents a $5$ percentage point decrease in maternal mortality risk. The problem asks for this value as a single decimal number.\n\n**2) Expected Number of Lives Saved**\n\nThe risk is interpreted as the probability of an event (maternal death) for each individual birth. The expected number of events in a cohort of size $N$ is the product of the probability of the event and the cohort size.\n\nThe expected number of maternal deaths in a cohort of size $N$ *without* the antiseptic procedures would be:\n$$E_{\\text{deaths, pre}} = N \\times R_{\\text{pre}}$$\nAnd the expected number of maternal deaths in the same cohort *with* the antiseptic procedures is:\n$$E_{\\text{deaths, post}} = N \\times R_{\\text{post}}$$\nThe expected number of lives saved, denoted as $L_{\\text{saved}}$, is the difference between the expected number of deaths without the intervention and the expected number of deaths with the intervention.\n$$L_{\\text{saved}} = E_{\\text{deaths, pre}} - E_{\\text{deaths, post}}$$\nThis can be rewritten by factoring out $N$:\n$$L_{\\text{saved}} = N \\times (R_{\\text{pre}} - R_{\\text{post}})$$\n$$L_{\\text{saved}} = N \\times ARR$$\nSubstituting the value for $N$ and the calculated $ARR$:\n$$L_{\\text{saved}} = 2,000 \\times 0.05$$\n$$L_{\\text{saved}} = 100$$\nThus, in a cohort of $2,000$ births, the adoption of antiseptic procedures is expected to save $100$ maternal lives. This is an exact whole number.\n\nThe final result is a two-entry row vector containing the absolute risk reduction and the number of lives saved.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.05 & 100 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4771136"}, {"introduction": "As states began to systematically collect health data in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, new metrics were developed to monitor population health, with the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) becoming a key indicator of obstetric safety.

However, live birth registration is incomplete. The relationship between recorded live births ($B_{rec}$) and the true number of live births ($B_{true}$) is given by:\n$$B_{rec} = B_{true} \\times c$$\n\nThe general definition of the Maternal Mortality Ratio is:\n$$MMR = \\frac{\\text{Number of maternal deaths}}{\\text{Number of live births}} \\times S$$\n\nWe will compute the two required values in sequence.\n\n1.  **Recorded MMR ($MMR_{rec}$)**\n    This value is calculated using the raw, unadjusted numbers as they appear in the registry. We use the number of recorded live births, $B_{rec}$, in the denominator.\n    $$MMR_{rec} = \\frac{D_m}{B_{rec}} \\times S$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$MMR_{rec} = \\frac{20}{50,000} \\times 100,000$$\n    The calculation simplifies to:\n    $$MMR_{rec} = 20 \\times \\frac{100,000}{50,000} = 20 \\times 2 = 40$$\n    The problem asks for this value to be rounded to four significant figures. As an exact integer, $40$ can be written as $40.00$ to meet this requirement.\n\n2.  **Coverage-Adjusted MMR ($MMR_{adj}$)**\n    This value requires correcting the denominator to reflect the true number of live births. First, we must calculate the true number of live births, $B_{true}$, by rearranging the completeness formula:\n    $$B_{true} = \\frac{B_{rec}}{c}$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$B_{true} = \\frac{50,000}{0.80} = 62,500$$\n    This is the estimated true number of live births. Now, we compute the adjusted MMR using this corrected denominator. The number of deaths, $D_m$, remains unchanged as it is assumed to be completely reported.\n    $$MMR_{adj} = \\frac{D_m}{B_{true}} \\times S$$\n    Substituting the values:\n    $$MMR_{adj} = \\frac{20}{62,500} \\times 100,000$$\n    The calculation simplifies to:\n    $$MMR_{adj} = 20 \\times \\frac{100,000}{62,500} = 20 \\times 1.6 = 32$$\n    This is also an exact integer. To express it to four significant figures as required, we write it as $32.00$.\n\nThe failure to account for under-registration of live births leads to an artificially low denominator, which in turn results in an overestimation of the mortality ratio ($40.00$ per $100,000$) compared to the more accurate, adjusted ratio ($32.00$ per $100,000$).\n\nThe two requested values are $MMR_{rec} = 40.00$ and $MMR_{adj} = 32.00$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n40.00 & 32.00\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4771181"}, {"introduction": "The late twentieth century saw the widespread adoption of new diagnostic technologies in the delivery room, such as Cardiotocography (CTG), which promised to improve fetal outcomes but also altered clinical practice in complex ways.

Mastering this analysis is essential for understanding the often-unintended consequences of medical innovation and the difficult trade-offs inherent in modern clinical decision-making [@problem_id:4771148].", "problem": "In the late twentieth century, the adoption of Cardiotocography (CTG) in obstetric practice was argued to reduce hypoxic injury but was observed to alter intervention patterns.

The prevalence of clinically significant fetal distress, as judged by postnatal indicators and expert review, is $p = 0.10$. The CTG used has sensitivity $s = 0.85$ and specificity $c = 0.70$ for detecting fetal distress at a decision threshold employed by the unit. Before CTG adoption, archival records indicate that cesarean delivery for suspected fetal distress based on intermittent auscultation and clinical signs captured a fraction $r = 0.40$ of truly distressed cases, with negligible cesareans induced by false alarm in non-distressed cases.\n\nAfter CTG adoption, the unit’s policy is to recommend cesarean delivery for any CTG-positive labor to manage suspected fetal distress, replacing the prior clinical rule for distress (that is, distress-related cesareans are now triggered exclusively by CTG results). Cesareans for unrelated indications are unaffected and outside this calculation.\n\nUsing fundamental definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence, compute the expected numbers of true positives and false positives produced by CTG over $N = 1{,}000$ labors, and then determine the net change in the cesarean rate attributable to the change in distress management policy. Express the final net increase in the cesarean rate as a decimal fraction of all labors. Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of diagnostic testing, is well-posed with sufficient data, and is expressed in objective, formalizable language.\n\nThis problem requires a quantitative comparison of two policies for initiating cesarean delivery for suspected fetal distress. We will calculate the number of cesareans under the old policy (based on intermittent auscultation) and the new policy (based on Cardiotocography, or CTG), and then find the difference in their rates relative to the total number of labors.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the given information.\nThe total number of labors is $N = 1,000$.\nThe prevalence of true fetal distress (the condition, D) is $p = P(D) = 0.10$.\nThe sensitivity of the CTG test is $s = 0.85$. Sensitivity is the probability of a positive test result ($T^+$) given that the condition is present: $s = P(T^+|D)$.\nThe specificity of the CTG test is $c = 0.70$. Specificity is the probability of a negative test result ($T^-$) given that the condition is absent ($D^c$): $c = P(T^-|D^c)$.\nUnder the old policy, the fraction of truly distressed cases resulting in a cesarean was $r = 0.40$. The number of false-alarm cesareans in non-distressed cases was negligible, which we formalize as $0$.\n\nLet's calculate the absolute numbers for the distressed and non-distressed populations within the cohort of $N=1,000$ labors.\nNumber of truly distressed labors: $N_D = N \\times p = 1,000 \\times 0.10 = 100$.\nNumber of non-distressed labors: $N_{D^c} = N \\times (1-p) = 1,000 \\times (1 - 0.10) = 900$.\n\nThe first part of the problem asks for the expected numbers of true positives and false positives produced by CTG.\nA true positive (TP) is a case where the fetus is truly distressed and the CTG test is positive. The number of true positives, $N_{TP}$, is calculated by applying the sensitivity to the distressed population.\n$$N_{TP} = N_D \\times s = 100 \\times 0.85 = 85$$\nA false positive (FP) is a case where the fetus is not distressed, but the CTG test is positive. The probability of a false positive is $P(T^+|D^c)$, which is equal to $1 - c$ (since specificity $c=P(T^-|D^c)$).\n$$P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - c = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30$$\nThe number of false positives, $N_{FP}$, is calculated by applying this probability to the non-distressed population.\n$$N_{FP} = N_{D^c} \\times (1-c) = 900 \\times 0.30 = 270$$\nSo, the expected number of true positives is $85$ and the expected number of false positives is $270$.\n\nNext, we determine the total number of cesareans performed under each policy.\n\n1.  **Cesareans under the old policy ($C_{old}$):**\n    Cesareans were performed on a fraction $r=0.40$ of the truly distressed cases.\n    $$N_{C, old} = N_D \\times r + N_{D^c} \\times 0 = 100 \\times 0.40 + 900 \\times 0 = 40$$\n    The total number of cesareans for suspected fetal distress under the old policy is $40$. The cesarean rate for this indication was $\\frac{40}{1,000} = 0.04$.\n\n2.  **Cesareans under the new policy ($C_{new}$):**\n    Cesareans are performed for any CTG-positive labor. The total number of CTG-positive labors is the sum of true positives and false positives.\n    $$N_{C, new} = N_{TP} + N_{FP} = 85 + 270 = 355$$\n    The total number of cesareans under the new policy is $355$. The cesarean rate for this indication is $\\frac{355}{1,000} = 0.355$.\n\nFinally, we compute the net change in the cesarean rate attributable to the new policy. This is the difference between the new rate and the old rate.\nNet change in rate, $\\Delta R$, is given by:\n$$\\Delta R = \\frac{N_{C, new}}{N} - \\frac{N_{C, old}}{N} = \\frac{355}{1,000} - \\frac{40}{1,000} = 0.355 - 0.040 = 0.315$$\n\nThis value represents the net increase in the cesarean rate as a decimal fraction of all labors. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $0.315$ already has three significant figures ($3$, $1$, $5$).\n\nWe can verify this result using a purely symbolic approach.\nThe old cesarean rate is $R_{\\text{old}} = \\frac{Npr}{N} = pr$.\nThe new cesarean rate is $R_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{Nps + N(1-p)(1-c)}{N} = ps + (1-p)(1-c)$.\nThe net change in rate is $\\Delta R = R_{\\text{new}} - R_{\\text{old}} = ps + (1-p)(1-c) - pr$.\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\\Delta R = (0.10)(0.85) + (1-0.10)(1-0.70) - (0.10)(0.40)$$\n$$\\Delta R = 0.085 + (0.90)(0.30) - 0.040$$\n$$\\Delta R = 0.085 + 0.270 - 0.040$$\n$$\\Delta R = 0.355 - 0.040 = 0.315$$\nThe calculation is consistent.
