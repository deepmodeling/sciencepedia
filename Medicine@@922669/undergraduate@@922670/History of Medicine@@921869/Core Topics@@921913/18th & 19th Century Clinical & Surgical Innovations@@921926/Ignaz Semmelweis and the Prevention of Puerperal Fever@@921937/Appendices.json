The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded in historical context and standard epidemiological methods, and contains all necessary data and definitions for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is provided below.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in three parts as requested: first, the computation of month-specific risk measures; second, an interpretation of these measures in the context of random variation; and finally, the calculation of an overall relative risk based on aggregated data.\n\nLet $d_{1,t}$ and $n_{1,t}$ be the number of maternal deaths and deliveries, respectively, in Clinic $1$ during month $t$, for $t \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. Similarly, let $d_{2,t}$ and $n_{2,t}$ be the corresponding counts for Clinic $2$.\n\nAccording to the provided definitions, the mortality risk for a given clinic in a given month is the ratio of deaths to deliveries.\nFor Clinic $1$, the risk in month $t$ is $R_{1,t} = \\frac{d_{1,t}}{n_{1,t}}$.\nFor Clinic $2$, the risk in month $t$ is $R_{2,t} = \\frac{d_{2,t}}{n_{2,t}}$.\n\nThe absolute risk difference for month $t$ is $ARD_t = R_{1,t} - R_{2,t}$.\nThe relative risk for month $t$ is $RR_t = \\frac{R_{1,t}}{R_{2,t}}$.\n\nUsing the provided data, we compute these quantities for each month:\n\nFor month $t=1$:\n$R_{1,1} = \\frac{18}{320} = 0.05625$\n$R_{2,1} = \\frac{5}{250} = 0.02000$\n$ARD_1 = 0.05625 - 0.02000 = 0.03625$\n$RR_1 = \\frac{0.05625}{0.02000} = 2.8125$\n\nFor month $t=2$:\n$R_{1,2} = \\frac{15}{300} = 0.05000$\n$R_{2,2} = \\frac{8}{260} \\approx 0.03077$\n$ARD_2 = 0.05000 - \\frac{8}{260} \\approx 0.01923$\n$RR_2 = \\frac{0.05000}{8/260} = 1.625$\n\nFor month $t=3$:\n$R_{1,3} = \\frac{12}{280} \\approx 0.04286$\n$R_{2,3} = \\frac{6}{240} = 0.02500$\n$ARD_3 = \\frac{12}{280} - 0.02500 \\approx 0.01786$\n$RR_3 = \\frac{12/280}{0.02500} \\approx 1.714$\n\nFor month $t=4$:\n$R_{1,4} = \\frac{20}{310} \\approx 0.06452$\n$R_{2,4} = \\frac{7}{255} \\approx 0.02745$\n$ARD_4 = \\frac{20}{310} - \\frac{7}{255} \\approx 0.03707$\n$RR_4 = \\frac{20/310}{7/255} \\approx 2.350$\n\nFor month $t=5$:\n$R_{1,5} = \\frac{14}{290} \\approx 0.04828$\n$R_{2,5} = \\frac{5}{245} \\approx 0.02041$\n$ARD_5 = \\frac{14}{290} - \\frac{5}{245} \\approx 0.02787$\n$RR_5 = \\frac{14/290}{5/245} \\approx 2.366$\n\nFor month $t=6$:\n$R_{1,6} = \\frac{16}{305} \\approx 0.05246$\n$R_{2,6} = \\frac{6}{250} = 0.02400$\n$ARD_6 = \\frac{16}{305} - 0.02400 \\approx 0.02846$\n$RR_6 = \\frac{16/305}{0.02400} \\approx 2.186$\n\nNext, we interpret the magnitudes of the month-specific relative risks. The core of the inferential framework is to assess whether the observed $RR_t$ values are sufficiently far from $1$ (the null value, indicating no difference in risk) to be considered unlikely to have arisen from random chance alone. The problem specifies a large-sample approximation based on the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The standard approach is to analyze the natural logarithm of the relative risk, $\\ln(RR_t)$, because its sampling distribution is better approximated by a normal distribution than that of $RR_t$ itself.\n\nLet $\\hat{R}_{1,t}$ and $\\hat{R}_{2,t}$ be the estimated risks for month $t$. The estimated log-relative risk is $\\ln(\\widehat{RR}_t) = \\ln(\\hat{R}_{1,t}) - \\ln(\\hat{R}_{2,t})$. Under the specified binomial model and assuming independence between the two clinics, the variance of the log-relative risk can be approximated using the delta method. The variance of a single log-risk $\\ln(\\hat{R})$ where $\\hat{R}=d/n$ is approximately $\\text{Var}(\\ln(\\hat{R})) \\approx \\frac{1-R}{nR}$. We estimate this by plugging in the observed values: $\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\ln(\\hat{R})) = \\frac{1-d/n}{n(d/n)} = \\frac{n-d}{nd} = \\frac{1}{d} - \\frac{1}{n}$.\n\nThe standard error of the log-relative risk is the square root of the sum of the variances of the individual log-risks:\n$$SE(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}_t)) = \\sqrt{\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\ln(\\hat{R}_{1,t})) + \\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\ln(\\hat{R}_{2,t}))} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{d_{1,t}} - \\frac{1}{n_{1,t}}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{d_{2,t}} - \\frac{1}{n_{2,t}}\\right)}$$\nUsing this, we can construct a confidence interval (e.g., a $95\\%$ CI) for the true log-relative risk: $\\ln(\\widehat{RR}_t) \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\times SE(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}_t))$, where $z_{0.025} \\approx 1.96$. By exponentiating the interval's endpoints, we obtain a CI for the true $RR_t$.\n\nFor month $t=2$, with $\\widehat{RR}_2 = 1.625$:\n$\\ln(\\widehat{RR}_2) = \\ln(1.625) \\approx 0.4855$.\n$SE(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}_2)) = \\sqrt{(\\frac{1}{15} - \\frac{1}{300}) + (\\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{1}{260})} \\approx \\sqrt{0.06333 + 0.12115} \\approx 0.4295$.\nA $95\\%$ CI for $\\ln(RR_2)$ is $0.4855 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.4295$, which is $0.4855 \\pm 0.8418$, or $[-0.3563, 1.3273]$.\nExponentiating gives a CI for $RR_2$ of $[\\exp(-0.3563), \\exp(1.3273)]$, which is approximately $[0.70, 3.77]$. Since this interval contains $1.0$, the observed relative risk of $1.625$ in month $2$ is not statistically significant at the $\\alpha=0.05$ level; it is consistent with an explanation of random variation.\n\nIn contrast, for month $t=1$, with $\\widehat{RR}_1 = 2.8125$:\n$\\ln(\\widehat{RR}_1) \\approx 1.0341$.\n$SE(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}_1)) = \\sqrt{(\\frac{1}{18} - \\frac{1}{320}) + (\\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{250})} \\approx \\sqrt{0.05243 + 0.196} \\approx 0.4984$.\nA $95\\%$ CI for $\\ln(RR_1)$ is $1.0341 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.4984$, which is $1.0341 \\pm 0.9769$, or $[0.0572, 2.011]$.\nExponentiating gives a CI for $RR_1$ of $[\\exp(0.0572), \\exp(2.011)]$, which is approximately $[1.06, 7.47]$. This interval does not include $1.0$, indicating that the elevated risk in Clinic $1$ during month $1$ is statistically significant.\n\nThe interpretation is thus that while every single month shows a higher risk in Clinic $1$ ($RR_t > 1$ for all $t$), the statistical evidence from any individual month may be weak due to small numbers of deaths, leading to high sampling variability and wide confidence intervals. The consistent pattern of elevated risk across all months, however, strongly suggests a systematic underlying cause rather than mere chance, which is precisely the conclusion Semmelweis reached. This motivates aggregating the data to obtain a more precise and stable estimate of the overall effect.\n\nFinally, we compute the overall relative risk by aggregating the data over all $6$ months.\nTotal deaths in Clinic $1$: $D_1 = \\sum_{t=1}^{6} d_{1,t} = 18 + 15 + 12 + 20 + 14 + 16 = 95$.\nTotal deliveries in Clinic $1$: $N_1 = \\sum_{t=1}^{6} n_{1,t} = 320 + 300 + 280 + 310 + 290 + 305 = 1805$.\nAggregated risk in Clinic $1$: $R_{1,agg} = \\frac{D_1}{N_1} = \\frac{95}{1805}$.\n\nTotal deaths in Clinic $2$: $D_2 = \\sum_{t=1}^{6} d_{2,t} = 5 + 8 + 6 + 7 + 5 + 6 = 37$.\nTotal deliveries in Clinic $2$: $N_2 = \\sum_{t=1}^{6} n_{2,t} = 250 + 260 + 240 + 255 + 245 + 250 = 1500$.\nAggregated risk in Clinic $2$: $R_{2,agg} = \\frac{D_2}{N_2} = \\frac{37}{1500}$.\n\nThe overall relative risk is the ratio of these aggregated risks:\n$$RR_{overall} = \\frac{R_{1,agg}}{R_{2,agg}} = \\frac{95/1805}{37/1500} = \\frac{95 \\times 1500}{1805 \\times 37} = \\frac{142500}{66785} \\approx 2.13364$$\nRounding this result to three significant figures as requested gives $2.13$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.13}$$", "id": "4751540"}, {"introduction": "Observing a dramatic drop in mortality after his intervention, Semmelweis had powerful evidence for its effectiveness.

Starting from core definitions used in evidence-based medicine—specifically, absolute risk and absolute risk reduction—derive the quantity known as the Number Needed to Treat (NNT), and compute its value for the introduction of handwashing under these conditions. Do not assume any shortcut formulas; begin with the definition of risk as the probability of the outcome in the relevant group and proceed to a definition-based derivation of the NNT. Then, based on your computed NNT, briefly discuss the ethical implications for clinical decision-making in $1847$, considering plausible constraints of the period (including limited resources, lack of formal consent frameworks, and the imperative to reduce mortality).\n\nExpress the NNT as a pure number without any units. Provide the exact integer value if applicable. Use risks expressed as decimals or fractions; do not use the percentage sign.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the history of medicine and epidemiology, well-posed with sufficient data for a unique solution, and objectively stated.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in three stages: first, the derivation of the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) from fundamental definitions of risk; second, the computation of its value using the data provided; and third, a discussion of the ethical implications in the historical context.\n\nLet $R_c$ be the risk of contracting puerperal fever in the control group (i.e., before the handwashing intervention). This is also known as the baseline risk. From the problem statement, we are given $R_c = 0.12$.\nLet $R_t$ be the risk of contracting puerperal fever in the treatment group (i.e., after the introduction of handwashing). From the problem statement, we are given $R_t = 0.02$.\nRisk, in this context, is the probability of the adverse outcome (puerperal fever) occurring in a specified group.\n\nThe first quantity to define is the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR). The ARR quantifies the reduction in risk attributable to the intervention. It is defined as the difference between the risk in the control group and the risk in the treatment group.\n$$ARR = R_c - R_t$$\n\nThe Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is defined as the average number of patients who must be treated with the specific intervention to prevent one additional adverse outcome. We can derive the formula for NNT from this conceptual definition.\n\nConsider a cohort of $N$ patients.\nWithout the intervention, the expected number of patients experiencing the adverse outcome is $N_{c, \\text{outcome}} = N \\times R_c$.\nWith the intervention, the expected number of patients experiencing the adverse outcome in a cohort of the same size is $N_{t, \\text{outcome}} = N \\times R_t$.\n\nThe number of adverse outcomes prevented in this cohort of $N$ patients by applying the intervention is the difference between these two quantities:\n$$N_{\\text{prevented}} = N_{c, \\text{outcome}} - N_{t, \\text{outcome}} = (N \\times R_c) - (N \\times R_t)$$\nFactoring out $N$, we get:\n$$N_{\\text{prevented}} = N \\times (R_c - R_t)$$\nRecognizing that $(R_c - R_t)$ is the ARR, this becomes:\n$$N_{\\text{prevented}} = N \\times ARR$$\n\nThe NNT is the specific value of $N$ for which exactly one adverse outcome is prevented, i.e., $N_{\\text{prevented}} = 1$. We set the equation accordingly and solve for $N$, which will be our NNT.\n$$1 = NNT \\times ARR$$\nRearranging this equation gives the formula for NNT:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nSubstituting the definition of ARR, we arrive at the final derived formula in terms of baseline risks:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{R_c - R_t}$$\nThis completes the required derivation from first principles.\n\nNow, we compute the value of NNT using the provided data for Semmelweis's intervention.\nThe given risks are $R_c = 0.12$ and $R_t = 0.02$.\nFirst, calculate the Absolute Risk Reduction:\n$$ARR = 0.12 - 0.02 = 0.10$$\nNext, calculate the NNT using the derived formula:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR} = \\frac{1}{0.10} = 10$$\nThe computed NNT is $10$. This means that, on average, for every $10$ women whose attendants practiced chlorinated-lime handwashing, one case of puerperal fever was prevented.\n\nFinally, we discuss the ethical implications for clinical decision-making in $1847$. An NNT of $10$ signifies an intervention of exceptionally high efficacy, especially considering the severity of puerperal fever, which was frequently fatal.\n1.  **Beneficence and Non-Maleficence**: The core ethical principles of medicine are to act in the best interest of the patient (beneficence) and to do no harm (non-maleficence). The baseline mortality risk of $12\\%$ was catastrophic. An intervention that could reduce this risk so drastically, at a low cost (chlorinated lime was inexpensive) and with minimal effort, created a powerful ethical imperative. To continue practicing without handwashing, given the data, was to knowingly expose patients to a preventable, substantial risk of death, thereby violating the principle of non-maleficence.\n2.  **Evidence vs. Mechanism**: In $1847$, the germ theory of disease was not yet established, and Semmelweis’s \"cadaveric particles\" hypothesis was met with resistance, as it implicitly blamed physicians for patient deaths. However, from an ethical standpoint, the obligation to the patient's welfare outweighs professional pride or the need for a complete mechanistic understanding. The empirical evidence was overwhelmingly strong. The ethical mandate is to follow the evidence that saves lives, even in the absence of a fully accepted theory.\n3.  **Resource Allocation and Feasibility**: The intervention was not resource-intensive or complex. This removes any ethical objections based on feasibility or the need to ration scarce resources. Given its low cost and high impact, not implementing it would be ethically indefensible.\nIn summary, the NNT of $10$ provides a quantitative underpinning for the strident ethical position that the medical community's failure to adopt Semmelweis's practice was a profound lapse. The data presented a clear, unambiguous choice between a practice that resulted in a high rate of death and a simple, cheap, and effective alternative.

Using a control clinic that did not adopt handwashing, you will learn how to estimate the true causal effect of Semmelweis's policy by separating it from any underlying temporal trends in mortality.", "problem": "In the mid-1840s at the Vienna General Hospital, Ignaz Semmelweis introduced mandatory handwashing with chlorinated lime in one obstetric clinic while another clinic did not change procedures. Consider the following hypothetical but historically plausible aggregate data on births and puerperal fever deaths, partitioned into a pre-intervention period (before handwashing) and a post-intervention period (after handwashing).

The solution will be structured by first defining the system and calculating the observed mortality probabilities, then formally introducing the causal inference framework to define the effect of interest, stating the necessary assumptions, deriving the DiD estimator, and finally computing the numerical result.\n\nLet $g$ be the index for the clinic, with $g=1$ for Clinic $1$ (the treated group) and $g=2$ for Clinic $2$ (the control group). Let $t$ be the index for the time period, with $t=0$ for the pre-intervention period and $t=1$ for the post-intervention period.\n\nThe primary outcome of interest is the mortality probability per birth, which is defined as the number of deaths divided by the number of births. Let $D_{g,t}$ be the number of puerperal fever deaths and $B_{g,t}$ be the number of births for clinic $g$ in period $t$. The observed mortality probability, denoted $Y_{g,t}$, is:\n$$\nY_{g,t} = \\frac{D_{g,t}}{B_{g,t}}\n$$\n\nUsing the provided data, we compute the observed mortality probabilities for each group in each period:\nFor Clinic $1$, pre-intervention ($g=1, t=0$):\n$$\nY_{1,0} = \\frac{D_{1,0}}{B_{1,0}} = \\frac{400}{4000} = 0.10\n$$\nFor Clinic $1$, post-intervention ($g=1, t=1$):\n$$\nY_{1,1} = \\frac{D_{1,1}}{B_{1,1}} = \\frac{84}{4200} = 0.02\n$$\nFor Clinic $2$, pre-intervention ($g=2, t=0$):\n$$\nY_{2,0} = \\frac{D_{2,0}}{B_{2,0}} = \\frac{266}{3800} = 0.07\n$$\nFor Clinic $2$, post-intervention ($g=2, t=1$):\n$$\nY_{2,1} = \\frac{D_{2,1}}{B_{2,1}} = \\frac{312}{3900} = 0.08\n$$\n\nTo formalize the causal question, we use the potential outcomes framework. Let $Y_{g,t}(1)$ be the potential mortality probability for clinic $g$ in period $t$ if the handwashing intervention were implemented, and let $Y_{g,t}(0)$ be the potential mortality probability if the intervention were not implemented. The intervention occurs only for Clinic $1$ in the post-intervention period. Therefore, the observed outcomes are:\n- $Y_{1,1} = Y_{1,1}(1)$ (Clinic $1$ is treated in period $1$)\n- $Y_{1,0} = Y_{1,0}(0)$ (Clinic $1$ is not treated in period $0$)\n- $Y_{2,1} = Y_{2,1}(0)$ (Clinic $2$ is not treated in period $1$)\n- $Y_{2,0} = Y_{2,0}(0)$ (Clinic $2$ is not treated in period $0$)\n\nThe causal effect of handwashing on the treated group is the difference between its observed outcome and its counterfactual outcome—what would have happened to Clinic $1$ in the post-intervention period had the handwashing policy not been introduced. This is the Average Treatment effect on the Treated (ATT), defined as:\n$$\n\\text{ATT} = E[Y_{1,1}(1) - Y_{1,1}(0)]\n$$\nThe fundamental problem of causal inference is that we observe $Y_{1,1}(1)$ but we do not observe the counterfactual $Y_{1,1}(0)$.\n\nThe difference-in-differences method allows us to estimate this counterfactual under a crucial assumption: the common-trend (or parallel trends) assumption. This assumption posits that the change in the mortality probability that would have occurred for the treated group in the absence of treatment is the same as the observed change in the mortality probability for the untreated control group. Mathematically:\n$$\nE[Y_{1,1}(0) - Y_{1,0}(0)] = E[Y_{2,1}(0) - Y_{2,0}(0)]\n$$\nSince Clinic $2$ is never treated, its outcomes are always \"untreated,\" so $Y_{2,t} = Y_{2,t}(0)$. The equation becomes:\n$$\nE[Y_{1,1}(0) - Y_{1,0}(0)] = E[Y_{2,1} - Y_{2,0}]\n$$\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the unobserved counterfactual, $E[Y_{1,1}(0)]$:\n$$\nE[Y_{1,1}(0)] = E[Y_{1,0}(0)] + (E[Y_{2,1}] - E[Y_{2,0}])\n$$\nSince Clinic $1$ was also untreated in the pre-intervention period, $E[Y_{1,0}(0)]$ is simply its observed outcome $E[Y_{1,0}]$. Thus, we can construct an estimate for the counterfactual, $\\hat{Y}_{1,1}(0)$, using the observed quantities:\n$$\n\\hat{Y}_{1,1}(0) = Y_{1,0} + (Y_{2,1} - Y_{2,0})\n$$\n\nThe DiD estimate of the causal effect, $\\hat{\\delta}_{\\text{DiD}}$, is the difference between the observed outcome for the treated group and its estimated counterfactual outcome:\n$$\n\\hat{\\delta}_{\\text{DiD}} = Y_{1,1} - \\hat{Y}_{1,1}(0)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the estimated counterfactual:\n$$\n\\hat{\\delta}_{\\text{DiD}} = Y_{1,1} - [Y_{1,0} + (Y_{2,1} - Y_{2,0})]\n$$\nThis rearranges to the standard DiD formula:\n$$\n\\hat{\\delta}_{\\text{DiD}} = (Y_{1,1} - Y_{1,0}) - (Y_{2,1} - Y_{2,0})\n$$\nThe estimator is the difference in the change over time for the treated group, minus the difference in the change over time for the control group.\n\nIn addition to the common-trend assumption, identification of the causal effect relies on several other assumptions as specified:\n1.  **No Spillovers**: The handwashing policy in Clinic $1$ did not influence the mortality rate in Clinic $2$. If knowledge or practice of hygiene improvements \"spilled over\" to the control clinic, the control group's trend would not represent a pure baseline.\n2.  **Stable Case Mix**: The composition of patients (e.g., baseline health, parity, socioeconomic background) did not change over time differently between Clinic $1$ and Clinic $2$. Any such differential change could confound the estimated effect.\n3.  **Stable Measurement**: The methods for diagnosing and recording puerperal fever deaths were consistent in both clinics and across both time periods. A change in diagnostic criteria would create an artificial change in the measured mortality rates.\n4.  **No Anticipation Effects**: Behavior in Clinic $1$ did not change during the pre-intervention period in anticipation of the forthcoming policy. Such anticipation would contaminate the baseline measure $Y_{1,0}$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of the DiD estimate.\nFirst, calculate the change over time for each clinic:\nChange for Clinic $1$ (treated):\n$$\n\\Delta Y_1 = Y_{1,1} - Y_{1,0} = 0.02 - 0.10 = -0.08\n$$\nChange for Clinic $2$ (control):\n$$\n\\Delta Y_2 = Y_{2,1} - Y_{2,0} = 0.08 - 0.07 = 0.01\n$$\nThe mortality probability in the treated clinic decreased by $0.08$ (or $8$ percentage points), while in the control clinic it increased by $0.01$ (or $1$ percentage point).\n\nThe DiD estimate is the difference between these two changes:\n$$\n\\hat{\\delta}_{\\text{DiD}} = \\Delta Y_1 - \\Delta Y_2 = (-0.08) - (0.01) = -0.09\n$$\nThis result indicates that the handwashing intervention caused a reduction in the maternal mortality probability per birth of $0.09$. The background trend, as measured by the control clinic, was an increase in mortality of $0.01$. The intervention in Clinic $1$ not only counteracted this adverse trend but reduced the mortality rate substantially further. The estimated counterfactual mortality rate for Clinic $1$ in the post-intervention period was $Y_{1,0} + \\Delta Y_2 = 0.10 + 0.01 = 0.11$. The causal effect is the difference between the observed outcome ($0.02$) and this counterfactual ($0.11$), which is $0.02 - 0.11 = -0.09$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.09}$$", "id": "4751469"}]}
