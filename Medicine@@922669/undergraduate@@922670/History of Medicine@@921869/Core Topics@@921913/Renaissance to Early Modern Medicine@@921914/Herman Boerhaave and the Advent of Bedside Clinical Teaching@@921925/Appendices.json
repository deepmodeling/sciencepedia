[@problem_id:4747892]", "problem": "Herman Boerhaave (born $1668$, died $1738$) is widely credited with formalizing bedside clinical teaching in Leiden by organizing students to learn directly from patients in hospital wards. A central operational requirement for such bedside teaching is a steady inflow of new cases, which can be modeled using bed capacity and turnover under steady-state assumptions.\n\nConsider a single teaching ward under Boerhaave’s direction with bed capacity $B = 24$. Assume the ward operates at stable full occupancy throughout the term (that is, the number of occupied beds remains $B$ each day), and the weekly turnover proportion $p$ is defined as the fraction of currently occupied beds that are discharged and replaced within one week. Assume steady state so that the number of admissions per week equals the number of discharges per week.\n\nStarting only from these definitions and the conservation-of-flow principle (inflow equals outflow under steady occupancy), derive an expression for the expected number of new admissions (new cases) per week in terms of $B$ and $p$, and then evaluate it for $B = 24$ and $p = 0.25$. Express your final answer as the number of new cases per week. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement is first validated against the required criteria.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Bed capacity: $B = 24$.\n- The ward operates at stable full occupancy, so the number of occupied beds is $B$.\n- The weekly turnover proportion, $p$, is the fraction of currently occupied beds that are discharged and replaced within one week.\n- The system is in a steady state, meaning the number of admissions per week equals the number of discharges per week.\n- Specific value for the weekly turnover proportion: $p = 0.25$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed for validity:\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem uses a standard steady-state mass balance or conservation-of-flow model. This is a fundamental and well-established method for analyzing systems in equilibrium, widely used in engineering, physics, and operations research. The historical context concerning Herman Boerhaave is factually sound. The model is a simplification of a real-world system, but it does not violate any scientific principles.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides clear definitions for all variables ($B$, $p$) and specifies the governing principle (steady-state conservation of flow). The goal is to derive an expression and calculate a value, for which sufficient information is provided. A unique and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of subjective claims.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, missing information, contradiction, or ambiguity. It is a formalizable and solvable problem based on the provided definitions and principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\nLet $N_{adm}$ represent the number of new admissions per week and $N_{dis}$ represent the number of discharges per week.\nThe problem states that the ward is in a steady state with a constant number of occupied beds. The principle of conservation of flow dictates that for the number of patients to remain constant, the rate of inflow must equal the rate of outflow. In this context, the inflow is the number of new admissions, and the outflow is the number of discharges.\nTherefore, we have the steady-state equation:\n$$N_{adm} = N_{dis}$$\nThe problem defines the weekly turnover proportion, $p$, as \"the fraction of currently occupied beds that are discharged and replaced within one week\". The number of currently occupied beds is given as the full bed capacity, $B$.\nAccording to this definition, the number of discharges per week, $N_{dis}$, can be calculated as the proportion $p$ of the total number of occupied beds, $B$.\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$N_{dis} = p \\times B$$\nSubstituting this expression for $N_{dis}$ into our steady-state equation gives the expression for the number of new admissions per week:\n$$N_{adm} = p \\times B$$\nThis expression represents the expected number of new cases per week in terms of the bed capacity $B$ and the weekly turnover proportion $p$.\n\nThe problem requires evaluating this expression for the given values:\n- Bed capacity, $B = 24$.\n- Weekly turnover proportion, $p = 0.25$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$N_{adm} = 0.25 \\times 24$$\nThe decimal $0.25$ is equivalent to the fraction $\\frac{1}{4}$. The calculation becomes:\n$$N_{adm} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 24$$\n$$N_{adm} = 6$$\nThus, the expected number of new admissions (new cases) per week is $6$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "4747892"}, {"introduction": "At the heart of Boerhaave's teaching was the development of clinical reasoning: the ability to observe a patient's signs and symptoms and arrive at a likely diagnosis. While this was once considered an intuitive art, modern probability theory allows us to model this cognitive process rigorously. This practice challenges you to apply Bayesian principles to quantify how a single piece of evidence—a physical sign—can shift the probability between two competing diagnoses, translating historical practice into the language of modern data science. [@problem_id:4747830]", "problem": "Herman Boerhaave, a pioneer of bedside clinical teaching at Leiden, emphasized the evaluation of physical signs at the patient’s bedside to discriminate between competing diagnoses. Consider a historically plausible, modern reconstruction of such reasoning using probabilistic updating. Suppose a Leiden ward in the early eighteenth century typically saw two competing diagnostic categories, denoted $A$ and $B$. Before examining a particular patient, the prior probabilities are $P(A)=0.3$ and $P(B)=0.7$. During bedside evaluation, a specific physical sign described in contemporary notes is observed. Modern retrospective analysis estimates that this sign has a Likelihood Ratio (LR) of $LR=2$ favoring $A$ over $B$, understood as the ratio $P(\\text{sign}\\mid A)/P(\\text{sign}\\mid B)$. Using only the core definitions of prior probability, odds, Likelihood Ratio, and the relationship between odds and probability, determine the posterior probability $P(A\\mid \\text{sign})$ after observing the sign.

It presents a standard application of Bayesian probability theory in the context of medical diagnostics. The provided data are self-consistent and sufficient to determine a unique solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the posterior probability of diagnosis $A$ given the observation of a physical sign, denoted as $S$. This is the quantity $P(A \\mid S)$. We are instructed to solve this using the concepts of odds and likelihood ratios.\n\nLet $A$ and $B$ represent the two competing diagnostic categories. The prior probabilities are given as:\n$P(A) = 0.3$\n$P(B) = 0.7$\nNote that $P(A) + P(B) = 0.3 + 0.7 = 1$, which confirms that $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive and exhaustive possibilities for the diagnosis in this context.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the prior odds of diagnosis $A$ relative to diagnosis $B$. The odds of an event are the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring. In a two-outcome scenario like this, the prior odds of $A$ are:\n$$\nO(A) = \\frac{P(A)}{P(B)}\n$$\nSubstituting the given prior probabilities:\n$$\nO(A) = \\frac{0.3}{0.7} = \\frac{3}{7}\n$$\nNext, we incorporate the new evidence, which is the observation of the physical sign $S$. The strength of this evidence is given by the Likelihood Ratio ($LR$). The problem states the $LR$ favors $A$ over $B$ and is defined as:\n$$\nLR = \\frac{P(S \\mid A)}{P(S \\mid B)} = 2\n$$\nThe core principle of Bayesian updating in the odds formulation is that the posterior odds are the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.\n$$\nO(A \\mid S) = O(A) \\times LR\n$$\nHere, $O(A \\mid S)$ represents the posterior odds of $A$ after observing the sign $S$. We can derive this relationship from the definition of conditional probability (Bayes' theorem). The posterior odds are defined as:\n$$\nO(A \\mid S) = \\frac{P(A \\mid S)}{P(B \\mid S)}\n$$\nUsing Bayes' theorem, $P(X \\mid Y) = \\frac{P(Y \\mid X)P(X)}{P(Y)}$, we can write:\n$$\nP(A \\mid S) = \\frac{P(S \\mid A)P(A)}{P(S)}\n$$\n$$\nP(B \\mid S) = \\frac{P(S \\mid B)P(B)}{P(S)}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for posterior odds:\n$$\nO(A \\mid S) = \\frac{\\frac{P(S \\mid A)P(A)}{P(S)}}{\\frac{P(S \\mid B)P(B)}{P(S)}} = \\frac{P(S \\mid A)}{P(S \\mid B)} \\times \\frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = LR \\times O(A)\n$$\nThis confirms the validity of our updating rule. Now, we can calculate the posterior odds by substituting the known values:\n$$\nO(A \\mid S) = \\frac{3}{7} \\times 2 = \\frac{6}{7}\n$$\nThe final step is to convert these posterior odds back into a probability. The relationship between the probability of an event $E$, $P(E)$, and its odds, $O(E) = \\frac{P(E)}{1-P(E)}$, can be rearranged to solve for the probability:\n$$\nP(E) = \\frac{O(E)}{1 + O(E)}\n$$\nApplying this formula to our posterior odds $O(A \\mid S)$:\n$$\nP(A \\mid S) = \\frac{O(A \\mid S)}{1 + O(A \\mid S)}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated value of $O(A \\mid S)$:\n$$\nP(A \\mid S) = \\frac{\\frac{6}{7}}{1 + \\frac{6}{7}} = \\frac{\\frac{6}{7}}{\\frac{7}{7} + \\frac{6}{7}} = \\frac{\\frac{6}{7}}{\\frac{13}{7}}\n$$\n$$\nP(A \\mid S) = \\frac{6}{13}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer as a decimal number rounded to $4$ significant figures.

Eligibility is defined by presence, safety, and decisional capacity consistent with informed consent. Therefore, any patient who is unavailable, unsafe to approach, or unable to consent without a Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) is ineligible. This is a direct application of the ethical requirements for informed consent and clinical safety.\n\n2. A participation-type ratio is the count of cases meeting the numerator criterion divided by the count of cases meeting the denominator criterion.

We are told that of all patients who can be approached under these constraints, $2$ refuse student examination, and all others agree. Because the ineligible patients are not approached, the refusals occur within the eligible pool. Therefore, the number of consenting eligible patients is\n$$16 - 2 = 14.$$\n\nThere is a pedagogical cap of $14$ examinations per session.
