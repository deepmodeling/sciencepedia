{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The Enlightenment brought a passion for order to all fields of knowledge, and medicine was no exception. Inspired by the systematic classification of plants and animals by naturalists like Carl Linnaeus, physicians sought to create a 'nosology,' or a rational classification of diseases, to replace the confusing and often contradictory descriptions of the past. This exercise places you in the role of an eighteenth-century nosologist, tasked with creating a diagnostic system for a group of fevers based on their observable signs. By working through this problem [@problem_id:4768650], you will practice the crucial skill of identifying the most specific and stable characteristics to build a logical framework, demonstrating how classification forms the essential foundation for a scientific medicine.", "problem": "You are a physician in the late eighteenth century influenced by the Linnaean ideal of classification by observable, stable characters, and by the Enlightenment emphasis on empirical regularity and probabilistic caution. You wish to construct a nosology that maximizes discriminative power (separating diseases by features that yield the greatest number of distinct, non-overlapping groups at each step) while minimizing false positives (avoiding assigning a case to a category when its distinguishing character is not specific). You have compiled the following symptom matrix for eruptive fevers commonly discussed by eighteenth-century nosologists such as François Boissier de Sauvages de Lacroix and William Cullen:\n\n- Variola (smallpox): fever intensity high; rash morphology vesicular; typical duration $14$–$21$ days.\n- Rubeola (measles): fever intensity high; rash morphology maculopapular; typical duration $7$–$10$ days.\n- Rubella (German measles): fever intensity low to moderate; rash morphology maculopapular; typical duration $3$–$5$ days.\n- Scarlatina (scarlet fever): fever intensity high; rash morphology scarlatiniform (diffuse fine erythema); typical duration $7$–$10$ days.\n- Typhus (spotted fever): fever intensity high; rash morphology petechial; typical duration $7$–$14$ days.\n\nAssume the following for the sake of classification: rash morphologies are as observed, durations are typical ranges but there is day-to-day variation within the listed ranges, and fever intensity is a categorical observation (high, moderate, low) rather than a temperature measurement. Using foundational Enlightenment commitments to classification by specific characters and empiricism, and using the core definitions of specificity (probability of correctly rejecting non-cases) and pathognomonic sign (a sign that is uniquely characteristic of a disease), which of the following hierarchical schemes best satisfies the dual aim of maximizing discriminative power at the top split and minimizing false positives across the tree?\n\nA. First split by rash morphology: vesicular, scarlatiniform, petechial, maculopapular. Classify vesicular as Variola, scarlatiniform as Scarlatina, petechial as Typhus. For maculopapular cases, split by duration: $3$–$5$ days as Rubella; $7$–$10$ days as Rubeola. Use fever intensity only as a tertiary tie-breaker if a case straddles duration boundaries. Rationale: prioritize the most specific, stable morphological characters to reduce false positives; then use duration to separate the two maculopapular diseases that overlap in rash but diverge in length.\n\nB. First split by fever intensity (high versus not high), then split by duration (greater than $10$ days versus $10$ days or fewer), and only then use rash morphology to refine. Rationale: fever is the most salient presenting feature; duration thresholds further sharpen categories before final morphological confirmation.\n\nC. Compute a weighted additive score for each disease using the three features (assign weights: fever intensity high $=2$, maculopapular rash $=1$, vesicular or petechial rash $=2$, duration greater than $10$ days $=2$, duration $7$–$10$ days $=1$, duration $3$–$5$ days $=1$), then classify a case to the disease with the highest score. Rationale: integrating multiple characters numerically yields a more balanced classification and reduces dependence on any single feature.\n\nD. Group diseases by presumed causes into inflammatory versus putrid classes first, then refine using overall fever severity and patient constitution, leaving rash morphology and duration to later corroboration. Rationale: humoral and miasmatic causes provide the most fundamental distinctions, with signs serving to support causal categories.\n\nSelect the single best option.", "solution": "The problem asks to create a nosological hierarchy based on Enlightenment principles of classification by specific, stable, observable characters.\n1. **Analyze the characters**: Rash morphology is the most specific character. Vesicular (Variola), scarlatiniform (Scarlatina), and petechial (Typhus) are unique to a single disease in this set and are therefore pathognomonic within this context. Maculopapular rash is shared by Rubeola and Rubella. Fever intensity is less specific, as four diseases share 'high' intensity. Duration is a continuous variable with some overlap but offers a secondary way to distinguish diseases.\n2. **Evaluate the options based on discriminative power**:\n    *   **Option A** correctly prioritizes the most specific character (rash morphology) for the first split. This immediately and unambiguously classifies three of the five diseases. It then uses a secondary character (duration) to resolve the remaining ambiguity between the two maculopapular diseases. This is the most logical and efficient hierarchical scheme, embodying the principle of using the most powerful distinguishing feature first.\n    *   **Option B** starts with fever intensity, a less specific character that groups four distinct diseases together, leading to a poor initial separation and low discriminative power.\n    *   **Option C** uses an arbitrary numerical weighting, which is less rigorous than a logical hierarchy based on pathognomonic signs. It fails to give proper priority to a sign that is definitively diagnostic.\n    *   **Option D** relies on pre-Enlightenment causal theories ('putrid classes'), which contradicts the problem's premise of classification by empirical, observable signs.\n3. **Conclusion**: Option A represents the best application of Linnaean classification principles to the problem, maximizing diagnostic specificity and creating a logical, empirically grounded system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4768650"}, {"introduction": "Once diseases could be reliably identified, the next great Enlightenment challenge was to determine which treatments actually worked. This required a radical departure from reliance on ancient authority and anecdotal reports toward a new standard of empirical proof: the 'fair test'. The following problem asks you to design a clinical experiment to test a new scurvy treatment under the real-world constraints of an eighteenth-century naval voyage, a scenario famously navigated by James Lind. This practice [@problem_id:4768655] will challenge you to apply core principles like controlled comparison, allocation by chance, and the reduction of bias, illustrating the methodological revolution that gave birth to the modern clinical trial.", "problem": "A Royal Navy surgeon in the mid-eighteenth century, influenced by Enlightenment commitments to systematic observation and fair comparison, wishes to test a new herbal infusion claimed to prevent and treat scurvy. On a voyage, he identifies a group of sailors with clearly defined scorbutic signs (spongy gums, petechiae, lassitude, and delayed wound healing). Citrus is in very short supply and used only sparingly for the most debilitated; common remedies in circulation include cider, vinegar, and diluted “elixir of vitriol.” The surgeon can standardize rations and hammocks for the sickbay but cannot guarantee identical flavors among remedies. He has one assistant who could administer doses and another who could perform clinical examinations.\n\nFrom first principles relevant to Enlightenment medical method—namely, the need for controlled comparison, minimizing confounding by balanced allocation, reducing expectation bias via feasible blinding, and selecting valid and reliable outcomes—choose the minimally sufficient experimental design that would allow a credible test of the new infusion under these constraints. Pay attention to allocation, the feasibility and target of blinding, standardization of co-interventions, and outcome measures that can be observed onboard without laboratory equipment.\n\nWhich option best satisfies these requirements?\n\nA. Enroll approximately $24$ sailors with moderate scurvy and similar baseline severity; keep all on identical rations and rest in the sickbay. Allocate them in a $1\\!:\\!1$ ratio to either the new infusion or to a commonly used comparator (for example, diluted “elixir of vitriol”) by drawing lots from a hat to ensure chance allocation. Have one assistant dispense pre-labeled bottles so that the examining surgeon does not know which remedy each man receives, acknowledging that sailors themselves will likely discern differences in taste and thus cannot be blinded. Predefine primary outcomes as time (in days) to resolution of a composite of clinical signs (reduced gum swelling and bleeding, improved ability to stand and work a light watch) assessed twice daily using a standardized checklist, with secondary outcomes of relapse within one week after apparent recovery and any adverse effects recorded. Avoid crossover before the primary endpoint unless safety requires rescue treatment.\n\nB. Enroll a group of sick sailors and keep their care as usual for one week while recording their symptoms; then give all of them the new infusion for one additional week and compare the average change in symptoms before versus after the infusion. Permit men to improve their diet if they feel stronger and to take additional remedies if requested. Because taste cannot be masked, do not attempt any blinding.\n\nC. Assign the sickest sailors to the new infusion to maximize the chance of observing an effect and keep the less severe cases on the ship’s standard remedies. Because the ship’s cooks vary rations by mess, allow diet to vary naturally, as this reflects “real-world” practice. Use survival until the end of the voyage as the primary outcome, reasoning that death is the most objective endpoint and requires no blinding.\n\nD. To preserve order, give the new infusion to all men in the starboard watch who become scorbutic and maintain the port watch on usual remedies. Do not constrain rations or duties beyond what the officers assign for seamanship. After one month, compare the proportion “recovered” between watches based on reports from each watch’s petty officer, who knows which men received the new infusion.\n\nE. Prepare two beverages of identical appearance and taste by flavoring both with strong bitters; give one to all scorbutic sailors and the other to healthy sailors as a placebo. Ensure both the sailors and the surgeon are unaware of who receives which beverage. Use laboratory quantification of “anti-scorbutic principle” in the blood as the primary outcome, with clinical symptoms as a secondary outcome, and plan sample size calculations to detect small differences with high power.", "solution": "Begin from core Enlightenment methodological commitments and related definitions that form a valid base for designing a fair test in the history of medicine context:\n\n1. Fair comparison requires concurrent controls to distinguish treatment effects from natural history and time-varying influences. Absent laboratory theory of “vitamins,” the Enlightenment emphasis on empiricism dictates side-by-side observation under as similar conditions as possible.\n\n2. Allocation by chance reduces confounding by balancing prognostic factors, especially when the sample size $n$ is small. Drawing lots implements chance allocation consistent with period practice and the concept that unknown causes are, in expectation, balanced across groups.\n\n3. Blinding reduces expectation and observer bias. When participant blinding is infeasible because of taste and odor, outcome-assessor blinding remains a feasible and valuable safeguard, provided dispensing and assessing roles are separated.\n\n4. Standardization of co-interventions (diet, rest, exposure) reduces performance bias and isolates the treatment contrast to the remedies under test.\n\n5. Outcome measures should be valid (reflect scurvy severity) and reliable (consistently observable in the shipboard setting). Time-to-clinical-improvement and return-to-duty are observable without instruments and are meaningful to naval practice.\n\nApply these principles to each option:\n\nOption A analysis:\n- Allocation: Uses drawing lots to achieve chance allocation in a $1\\!:\\!1$ ratio across approximately $24$ sailors, which is historically plausible and balances known and unknown prognostic factors in expectation. With $n \\approx 24$, exact balance on every factor is not guaranteed, but chance allocation is the minimally sufficient method to reduce systematic bias compared to judgmental assignment.\n- Blinding: Recognizes that participant blinding is likely infeasible due to taste differences, but preserves assessor blinding by separating dispensing (coded bottles) from examining. This directly targets observer bias while acknowledging constraints.\n- Co-interventions: Keeps rations and rest standardized in the sickbay, reducing performance bias and isolating the treatment effect to the remedies.\n- Outcomes: Predefines a clinically valid composite (gum changes, bleeding, functional capacity) and measures time to event (days), assessed at regular intervals with a checklist. This increases reliability and makes the endpoint directly relevant (fitness for duty), with a reasonable secondary outcome of short-term relapse and safety.\n- Ethical and practical sufficiency: Avoids crossover until a primary endpoint is reached, with allowance for rescue if needed. Given constraints on citrus, using a commonly accepted comparator is realistic. This embodies Enlightenment empiricism and the early “fair test” ideal.\nVerdict: Correct.\n\nOption B analysis:\n- Allocation: No concurrent control group; a before-after design confounds treatment effect with natural history, regression to the mean, and time-varying factors (changes in weather, rations, workload).\n- Blinding: None; expectation effects on symptom reporting and observer bias are unmitigated.\n- Co-interventions: Permits diet and other remedies to vary after improvement, introducing performance bias precisely when improvement is attributed to the new infusion.\n- Outcomes: Symptom averages without standardization are vulnerable to measurement bias; no predefined objective threshold for improvement.\nVerdict: Incorrect, because it violates the need for a concurrent control and fails to minimize bias.\n\nOption C analysis:\n- Allocation: Intentionally assigns the sickest to the new infusion and less severe cases to control, guaranteeing baseline imbalance. Any difference in outcomes could reflect baseline severity rather than treatment effect; this inflates confounding rather than reducing it.\n- Blinding: None; both performance and observer biases are unchecked.\n- Co-interventions: Allows diet to vary by mess, introducing systematic differences unrelated to the infusion.\n- Outcomes: Mortality at voyage end is a coarse endpoint affected by many external factors (storms, infections, combat) and introduces variable follow-up time; it is not specific to scurvy recovery and fails the validity criterion for the targeted condition.\nVerdict: Incorrect, due to severe confounding and outcome invalidity for the question at hand.\n\nOption D analysis:\n- Allocation: Assigns by watch, effectively clustering by duty schedule without randomization. With only $2$ clusters, differences in workload, exposure, and officer practices will drive between-group differences; cluster-level confounding is extreme, and chance balance is not achieved.\n- Blinding: Outcome reports come from petty officers who know treatment status, maximizing observer and expectation bias.\n- Co-interventions: Rations and duties are unconstrained, so systematic differences in exposure and nutrition are likely between watches.\n- Outcomes: “Recovered” is not operationally defined or standardized, decreasing reliability and increasing subjectivity.\nVerdict: Incorrect, because of non-random cluster allocation, lack of blinding, and nonstandardized outcomes.\n\nOption E analysis:\n- Allocation and blinding: Proposes double blinding with taste-matching via strong bitters, which might be theoretically conceivable, but the design then misallocates comparators by giving one beverage to scorbutic sailors and the other to healthy sailors, eliminating the necessary concurrent control among comparable patients. Moreover, the primary outcome requires laboratory quantification of an “anti-scorbutic principle,” which was unavailable in the eighteenth century.\n- Feasibility: Laboratory assays did not exist; power calculations as conceived in modern statistics are anachronistic for this setting; identical taste masking for all remedies at sea would be logistically doubtful.\n- Outcomes: Prioritizes an infeasible laboratory endpoint over clinically valid signs observable onboard.\nVerdict: Incorrect, due to infeasible methods and fundamental design flaw (non-comparable groups).\n\nBy derivation from first principles—concurrent control, chance allocation, feasible blinding of assessors, standardized co-interventions, and valid shipboard outcomes—Option A achieves a minimally sufficient, historically plausible Enlightenment-style fair test within constraints.

Physicians and 'political arithmeticians' began using numbers not just to count, but to compare, analyze, and govern.

The raw data can be deceiving, and this exercise [@problem_id:4768628] guides you through deriving a method of age-standardization from first principles, a powerful technique to control for confounding variables. This hands-on calculation reveals how mathematical reasoning became an indispensable tool for uncovering the true patterns of health and disease at a societal level.", "problem": "In the late eighteenth century, quantitative demography emerging from the Bills of Mortality exemplified the Enlightenment’s drive to measure and compare. Consider two English parishes, $A$ and $B$, whose crude mortality rates are reported as $C_A = 50$ deaths per $1{,}000$ and $C_B = 60$ deaths per $1{,}000$. Each parish’s population is partitioned into two age groups: young ($Y$) and elderly ($E$). Parish $B$ has twice the proportion of elderly as parish $A$. Contemporary observations indicate that the age-specific mortality rate among the elderly is $3$ times the age-specific mortality rate among the young, and that the age-specific rates are approximately the same in both parishes owing to similar living conditions.\n\nStarting only from the core definitions that a crude rate is the number of events divided by the total population, that age-specific rates are events divided by population within age categories, and that a crude rate over categories equals a weighted mean of category-specific rates with category proportions as weights, do the following:\n\n1) Derive from first principles an expression for a directly age-standardized mortality rate using an arbitrary fixed standard age distribution, and explain why choosing a common set of weights is necessary to achieve comparability when age compositions differ.\n\n2) Using the given data and the constraint that the elderly rate is $3$ times the young rate, determine the elderly proportion in parish $A$ and the consistent age-specific mortality rates for $Y$ and $E$.\n\n3) Let the standard age distribution be the average of the two parishes’ age compositions. Compute the directly age-standardized mortality rate (common value) under this standard distribution. Express your final answer in deaths per $1{,}000$. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of demography and epidemiology, self-contained, and mathematically well-posed, providing sufficient information to determine a unique solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part solution: a theoretical derivation of direct standardization, the calculation of specific demographic parameters from the given data, and the computation of a standardized mortality rate.\n\n1) Derivation of the Age-Standardized Rate and Rationale for Its Use\n\nLet a population $i$ be partitioned into $j$ age groups. Let $P_{ij}$ be the population count in age group $j$ of population $i$, and let $D_{ij}$ be the number of deaths in that same subgroup. The total population is $P_i = \\sum_j P_{ij}$ and the total number of deaths is $D_i = \\sum_j D_{ij}$.\n\nThe age-specific mortality rate for group $j$ in population $i$ is defined as:\n$$m_{ij} = \\frac{D_{ij}}{P_{ij}}$$\nThe crude mortality rate for population $i$ is defined as the total number of deaths divided by the total population:\n$$C_i = \\frac{D_i}{P_i} = \\frac{\\sum_j D_{ij}}{\\sum_j P_{ij}}$$\nBy substituting $D_{ij} = m_{ij} P_{ij}$, we can express the crude rate as:\n$$C_i = \\frac{\\sum_j m_{ij} P_{ij}}{P_i}$$\nLet $p_{ij} = \\frac{P_{ij}}{P_i}$ be the proportion of the total population of $i$ that belongs to age group $j$. The set of proportions $\\{p_{i1}, p_{i2}, \\dots\\}$ represents the age composition of population $i$, with $\\sum_j p_{ij} = 1$. The crude rate can then be written as a weighted mean of the age-specific mortality rates:\n$$C_i = \\sum_j m_{ij} \\left(\\frac{P_{ij}}{P_i}\\right) = \\sum_j m_{ij} p_{ij}$$\nIn the given problem, the age-specific rates are the same in both parishes, so $m_{Aj} = m_{Bj} = m_j$. Therefore, the crude rates are $C_A = \\sum_j m_j p_{Aj}$ and $C_B = \\sum_j m_j p_{Bj}$. The observed difference between $C_A$ and $C_B$ does not arise from a difference in the underlying mortality risks ($m_j$), but from the difference in the age compositions ($p_{Aj}$ vs. $p_{Bj}$). This illustrates the principle of confounding, where the effect of age structure obscures the comparison of intrinsic mortality.\n\nTo achieve a fair comparison, a method of direct age-standardization is employed. This method calculates what the overall mortality rate would be in each population if they both had the same, common age structure, referred to as a \"standard population\". Let the age composition of this standard population be given by a set of weights $\\{w_1, w_2, \\dots\\}$, where $w_j$ is the proportion of the standard population in age group $j$ and $\\sum_j w_j = 1$.\n\nThe directly age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) for population $i$ is derived by applying these standard weights to population $i$'s age-specific mortality rates:\n$$ASMR_i = \\sum_j m_{ij} w_j$$\nThis expression provides a mortality rate that is adjusted for age, allowing for a comparison between populations free from the confounding effect of differing age compositions. Choosing a common set of weights $\\{w_j\\}$ is necessary because it establishes a common baseline for comparison, thereby isolating the true differences in age-specific mortality rates ($m_{ij}$) as the sole source of any remaining variation in the standardized rates.\n\n2) Determination of Age Proportions and Age-Specific Mortality Rates\n\nThe population is partitioned into two groups: young ($Y$) and elderly ($E$). Let $p_A$ and $p_B$ be the proportions of the elderly population in parishes $A$ and $B$, respectively. The proportions of the young population are then ($1-p_A$) and ($1-p_B$). Let $m_Y$ and $m_E$ be the age-specific mortality rates for the young and elderly, respectively, assumed to be the same for both parishes.\n\nThe givens are:\n- Crude mortality rate for parish $A$: $C_A = 50$ per $1{,}000$, or $0.050$.\n- Crude mortality rate for parish $B$: $C_B = 60$ per $1{,}000$, or $0.060$.\n- Relation of elderly proportions: $p_B = 2p_A$.\n- Relation of age-specific rates: $m_E = 3m_Y$.\n\nUsing the formula for the crude rate as a weighted average:\nFor parish $A$: $C_A = m_Y(1-p_A) + m_E p_A = 0.050$\nFor parish $B$: $C_B = m_Y(1-p_B) + m_E p_B = 0.060$\n\nSubstitute $m_E = 3m_Y$ into the equations:\n$0.050 = m_Y(1-p_A) + (3m_Y)p_A = m_Y(1 - p_A + 3p_A) = m_Y(1+2p_A)$\n$0.060 = m_Y(1-p_B) + (3m_Y)p_B = m_Y(1 - p_B + 3p_B) = m_Y(1+2p_B)$\n\nNow substitute $p_B = 2p_A$ into the second equation:\n$0.060 = m_Y(1 + 2(2p_A)) = m_Y(1+4p_A)$\n\nWe have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $p_A$ and $m_Y$:\n1) $0.050 = m_Y(1+2p_A)$\n2) $0.060 = m_Y(1+4p_A)$\n\nTo solve, we take the ratio of equation (2) to equation (1) to eliminate $m_Y$:\n$$\\frac{0.060}{0.050} = \\frac{m_Y(1+4p_A)}{m_Y(1+2p_A)}$$\n$$\\frac{6}{5} = \\frac{1+4p_A}{1+2p_A}$$\n$$6(1+2p_A) = 5(1+4p_A)$$\n$$6 + 12p_A = 5 + 20p_A$$\n$$1 = 8p_A$$\n$$p_A = \\frac{1}{8} = 0.125$$\nThe elderly proportion in parish $A$ is $\\frac{1}{8}$.\n\nNow, substitute $p_A = \\frac{1}{8}$ back into equation (1) to find $m_Y$:\n$$0.050 = m_Y\\left(1 + 2\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)\\right) = m_Y\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) = m_Y\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)$$\n$$m_Y = 0.050 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 0.040$$\nThe age-specific mortality rate for the young is $m_Y = 0.040$, or $40$ deaths per $1{,}000$.\n\nThe age-specific mortality rate for the elderly is:\n$$m_E = 3m_Y = 3 \\times 0.040 = 0.120$$\nThe age-specific mortality rate for the elderly is $m_E = 0.120$, or $120$ deaths per $1{,}000$.\n\n3) Computation of the Directly Age-Standardized Mortality Rate\n\nThe standard age distribution is the average of the two parishes' age compositions.\nFirst, determine the age composition of both parishes:\nParish $A$:\n- Elderly proportion: $p_A = \\frac{1}{8}$\n- Young proportion: $1-p_A = \\frac{7}{8}$\nParish $B$:\n- Elderly proportion: $p_B = 2p_A = 2\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- Young proportion: $1-p_B = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nThe standard weights, $w_Y$ and $w_E$, are the averages of these proportions:\n$$w_Y = \\frac{(1-p_A) + (1-p_B)}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{8} + \\frac{3}{4}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{8} + \\frac{6}{8}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{13}{8}}{2} = \\frac{13}{16}$$\n$$w_E = \\frac{p_A + p_B}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{4}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{2}{8}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{8}}{2} = \\frac{3}{16}$$\n(As a check, $w_Y + w_E = \\frac{13}{16} + \\frac{3}{16} = \\frac{16}{16} = 1$).\n\nThe directly age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) is calculated using these standard weights and the derived age-specific mortality rates, $m_Y = 0.040$ and $m_E = 0.120$. Since the age-specific rates are the same for both parishes, the ASMR will be a single common value.\n$$ASMR = m_Y w_Y + m_E w_E$$\n$$ASMR = (0.040)\\left(\\frac{13}{16}\\right) + (0.120)\\left(\\frac{3}{16}\\right)$$\n$$ASMR = \\frac{0.040 \\times 13 + 0.120 \\times 3}{16} = \\frac{0.520 + 0.360}{16} = \\frac{0.880}{16}$$\n$$ASMR = 0.055$$\nTo express this value in deaths per $1{,}000$, we multiply by $1{,}000$:\n$$0.055 \\times 1000 = 55$$\nThe directly age-standardized mortality rate is $55$ deaths per $1{,}000$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{55}$$", "id": "4768628"}]}
