The physical principles and values provided are standard in optics and consistent with the historical context. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the lateral diffraction-limited resolution, $d$. The Rayleigh criterion for resolving two point sources states that they are just distinguishable when the center of the diffraction pattern (Airy disk) of one source is directly over the first minimum of the diffraction pattern of the other. The angular separation corresponding to this condition is given by the angular radius of the first dark ring of the Airy pattern. For a circular aperture of diameter $D$, this minimum angular separation is:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{min}} \\approx 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda_m}{D}\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda_m$ is the wavelength of light in the medium between the object and the objective lens. If the object is at or near the focal plane of the objective lens, the minimum resolvable distance $d$ in the object plane is related to the angular resolution $\\theta_{\\mathrm{min}}$ by $d \\approx f \\theta_{\\mathrm{min}}$, where $f$ is the focal length of the objective.\n$$\nd \\approx f \\left( 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda_m}{D} \\right)\n$$\nThe half-angle of the cone of light collected by the objective from a point on the optical axis is denoted by $\\alpha$. From the geometry of the objective lens, its diameter $D$ can be related to the focal length $f$ and the half-angle $\\alpha$ by the approximation $D \\approx 2f \\sin\\alpha$. This relationship is exact if the objective satisfies the Abbe sine condition. Substituting this expression for $D$ into the equation for $d$:\n$$\nd \\approx f \\left( 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda_m}{2f \\sin\\alpha} \\right) = \\frac{0.61 \\lambda_m}{\\sin\\alpha}\n$$\nThe wavelength of light in a medium with refractive index $n$, $\\lambda_m$, is related to its wavelength in vacuum (or air, for $n \\approx 1$), $\\lambda$, by $\\lambda_m = \\lambda/n$. Substituting this into the expression for $d$:\n$$\nd = \\frac{0.61 (\\lambda/n)}{\\sin\\alpha} = \\frac{0.61 \\lambda}{n \\sin\\alpha}\n$$\nThe problem defines the Numerical Aperture as $\\mathrm{NA} = n \\sin\\alpha$.

In our case, $R = 1.342$, which is greater than $1$.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested: first, the calculation of the ratio $r$; second, an analysis of the resolvability of the flagellum's thickness; and third, an analysis of the perceptibility of its undulatory motion.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the ratio $r = f_{1}/f_{c}$**\n\nThe fundamental spatial frequency, $f_{1}$, of the sinusoidal undulation is defined as the reciprocal of its spatial wavelength, $\\Lambda$.\nGiven $\\Lambda = 30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$f_{1} = \\frac{1}{\\Lambda} = \\frac{1}{30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}$$\n\nThe cutoff spatial frequency, $f_{c}$, for an incoherent imaging system with a circular pupil is given by the formula $f_{c} = 2\\,\\mathrm{NA}/\\lambda$.\nWe are given $\\mathrm{NA} = 0.2$ and $\\lambda = 550\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. To maintain consistent units, we convert the wavelength to micrometers: $\\lambda = 550\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 0.55\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$f_{c} = \\frac{2\\,\\mathrm{NA}}{\\lambda} = \\frac{2 \\times 0.2}{0.55\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{0.4}{0.55}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1} = \\frac{40}{55}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1} = \\frac{8}{11}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$$\n\nThe dimensionless ratio $r$ is the ratio of the object's fundamental frequency to the system's cutoff frequency.\n$$r = \\frac{f_{1}}{f_{c}} = \\frac{1/(30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m})}{8/(11\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1})} = \\frac{1}{30} \\times \\frac{11}{8} = \\frac{11}{240}$$\nTo obtain a numerical value rounded to three significant figures:\n$$r = \\frac{11}{240} \\approx 0.045833...$$\n$$r \\approx 0.0458$$\n\n**Part 2: Resolvability of Flagellum Thickness**\n\nThe ability to resolve a feature size, such as the thickness of the flagellum, is determined by the microscope's lateral resolution limit. The problem provides the Rayleigh criterion for this limit, $d_{\\mathrm{R}}$.\n$$d_{\\mathrm{R}} = \\frac{0.61\\,\\lambda}{\\mathrm{NA}}$$\nUsing the given values $\\lambda = 0.55\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $\\mathrm{NA} = 0.2$:\n$$d_{\\mathrm{R}} = \\frac{0.61 \\times 0.55\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{0.2} = \\frac{0.3355\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{0.2} = 1.6775\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nThe thickness of the flagellum is given as $t = 0.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. We must compare this dimension to the resolution limit $d_{\\mathrm{R}}$.\n$$t = 0.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} < 1.6775\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = d_{\\mathrm{R}}$$\nSince the flagellum's thickness is significantly smaller than the Rayleigh resolution limit of the microscope, the two sides of the flagellum cannot be distinguished as separate. Thus, its thickness is not laterally resolvable. An object of this size can still be *detected* if it has sufficient contrast against the background, but it will appear as a blurred line whose apparent width is determined by the system's point spread function, approximately on the order of $d_{\\mathrm{R}}$, not its true physical thickness $t$.\n\n**Part 3: Perceptibility of Undulatory Motion**\n\nThe perceptibility of the wavelike shape of the flagellum depends on whether the optical system can transmit the spatial frequencies that constitute this shape. The problem idealizes this shape as a sinusoid with a fundamental spatial frequency $f_{1}$. The Optical Transfer Function (OTF) describes the contrast transfer for each spatial frequency. For a diffraction-limited system, the OTF is non-zero for all spatial frequencies up to the cutoff frequency $f_{c}$, and zero for all frequencies beyond it.\n\nThe condition for the shape to be transmitted, and thus for its motion to be perceptible, is that its characteristic spatial frequency must be less than the cutoff frequency of the microscope, i.e., $f_{1} < f_{c}$.\nThis is equivalent to the condition $r < 1$, where $r = f_1/f_c$.\nFrom our calculation in Part 1, we found:\n$$r \\approx 0.0458$$\nSince $r \\ll 1$, the fundamental spatial frequency of the undulation is well within the passband of the microscope's OTF. This means the sinusoidal pattern will be imaged with non-zero contrast, making the undulatory shape and its corresponding motion clearly perceptible. While the contrast of the imaged pattern will be attenuated relative to the object's intrinsic contrast (the value of the OTF at $f_1$ is less than $1$), it is fundamentally observable.\n\nIn summary, the specific spatial pattern of the flagellum's wave is coarse enough ($f_1 \\ll f_c$) to be readily imaged, but the flagellum itself is too thin ($t < d_R$) to be resolved in its thickness. Leeuwenhoek would have observed a moving, undulating line of a certain apparent brightness and width, but he would not have been able to measure its true sub-micrometer thickness.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0458}$$", "id": "4738915"}]}
