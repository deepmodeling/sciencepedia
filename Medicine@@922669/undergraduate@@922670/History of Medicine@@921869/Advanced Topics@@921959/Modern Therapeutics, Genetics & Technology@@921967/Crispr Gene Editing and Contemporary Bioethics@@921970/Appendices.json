To ground their risk-benefit analysis, they ask for a transparent, first-principles estimate of how sequence mismatches in the guide RNA (gRNA) affect off-target cleavage probability.\n\nUse the following context-appropriate foundational base:\n- The Central Dogma of molecular biology states that DNA is transcribed to RNA, and RNA is translated to protein. Gene editing aims to change DNA sequences, thereby altering downstream RNA and protein products.\n- CRISPR-Cas9 specificity arises from base-pairing between the gRNA and the target DNA. Empirically, mismatches in the gRNA relative to the DNA can reduce specificity and increase the probability of off-target cleavage. Mismatches in the proximal “seed” region near the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) are typically more disruptive than mismatches in distal positions away from the seed region.\n- In preliminary risk models, committees may approximate the effect of distal mismatches on off-target risk with an additive penalty per mismatch, recognizing that this is a conservative, first-order estimate rather than a mechanistic model.\n\nAssume a hypothetical empirical mismatch penalty model in which each distal mismatch increases the off-target cleavage probability additively by a constant amount $\\Delta p_{d}$. A proposed gRNA has exactly $2$ distal mismatches and no seed-region mismatches. The baseline off-target cleavage probability in the absence of mismatches is $p=0.02$, and the empirical distal mismatch penalty is $\\Delta p_{d}=0.10$ per distal mismatch.\n\nUsing only these definitions and assumptions, derive an expression for the new off-target cleavage probability $p'$ and then compute the relative increase $R$ defined by $R=\\frac{p'-p}{p}$.

Expected utility theory is a cornerstone of decision theory, and its application to medical ethics and risk-benefit analysis is a standard, recognized approach. The context of CRISPR gene editing and the ethical considerations of clinical trials are contemporary and scientifically relevant. The model is a simplification, but it is a valid and common type of simplification used to formalize ethical trade-offs.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary variables ($p$, $U_{harm}$, $U_{benefit}$), a clear objective function (maximizing expected utility), and a precise condition for the decision (admissibility).

It sets up a mathematical model without introducing subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed invalidating flaws. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, complete, and asks for a non-trivial derivation based on a foundational definition.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n---\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a decision rule for a clinical trial based on expected utility theory. The decision is whether to initiate a trial, and this action is deemed \"ethically admissible\" if its expected utility is at least as great as the utility of the alternative, which is not initiating the trial (the status quo).\n\nLet $EU_{intervention}$ be the expected utility of initiating the trial. The problem provides two mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes for the intervention:\n1.  A serious adverse event, which occurs with probability $p$. The utility of this outcome is given as a change of $-U_{harm}$ relative to the status quo.\n2.  A clinically meaningful correction, which occurs with probability $1 - p$. The utility of this outcome is a change of $+U_{benefit}$ relative to the status quo.\n\nThe problem explicitly provides the foundational definition of expected utility for discrete outcomes, $EU = \\sum_{i} P_i \\cdot U_i$, where $P_i$ is the probability of outcome $i$ and $U_i$ is its utility.\n\nApplying this definition to calculate $EU_{intervention}$:\n$$\nEU_{intervention} = (p)(-U_{harm}) + (1-p)(+U_{benefit})\n$$\n$$\nEU_{intervention} = -p U_{harm} + (1-p) U_{benefit}\n$$\n\nThe utility of the status quo (not intervening) is given as $0$. Let this be $EU_{status\\_quo}$.\n$$\nEU_{status\\_quo} = 0\n$$\n\nThe trial is considered ethically admissible in expected utility terms if the expected utility of the intervention is not less than the expected utility of the status quo. This establishes the following inequality:\n$$\nEU_{intervention} \\geq EU_{status\\_quo}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the expected utilities gives:\n$$\n-p U_{harm} + (1-p) U_{benefit} \\geq 0\n$$\n\nThe goal is to find a threshold probability, $p^{\\ast}$, such that the trial is admissible if and only if $p \\leq p^{\\ast}$. To find this threshold, we must solve the inequality for $p$.\nFirst, expand the term $(1-p) U_{benefit}$:\n$$\n-p U_{harm} + U_{benefit} - p U_{benefit} \\geq 0\n$$\nNext, move the terms containing $p$ to the right-hand side of the inequality:\n$$\nU_{benefit} \\geq p U_{harm} + p U_{benefit}\n$$\nFactor out $p$ on the right-hand side:\n$$\nU_{benefit} \\geq p (U_{harm} + U_{benefit})\n$$\nThe problem states that $U_{harm} > 0$ and $U_{benefit} > 0$. Therefore, their sum, $(U_{harm} + U_{benefit})$, is a strictly positive quantity. We can divide both sides of the inequality by this sum without changing the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$\n\\frac{U_{benefit}}{U_{harm} + U_{benefit}} \\geq p\n$$\nThis inequality can be rewritten as:\n$$\np \\leq \\frac{U_{benefit}}{U_{harm} + U_{benefit}}\n$$\nThis expression gives the condition under which the trial is admissible. The problem asks for the threshold $p^{\\ast}$ such that the trial is admissible if and only if $p \\leq p^{\\ast}$. By comparing our derived condition with this requirement, we can directly identify $p^{\\ast}$.\n$$\np^{\\ast} = \\frac{U_{benefit}}{U_{harm} + U_{benefit}}\n$$\nThis is the maximum probability of a serious adverse event that can be tolerated for the trial to be considered ethically admissible under this utilitarian framework. The expression can also be written in terms of a benefit-to-harm ratio. Let $R = \\frac{U_{benefit}}{U_{harm}}$. Then $p^{\\ast} = \\frac{U_{benefit}}{U_{harm} + U_{benefit}} = \\frac{U_{benefit}/U_{harm}}{U_{harm}/U_{harm} + U_{benefit}/U_{harm}} = \\frac{R}{1+R}$. This confirms the structure of the result, where the threshold probability of harm is a function of the relative magnitudes of benefit and harm.

While $c$ is a critical variable for calculating the manufacturer's profit (which is $P - c$) or the societal net benefit (which might be evaluated as $(\\lambda \\times Q) - c$), it is irrelevant for calculating the net monetary benefit *from the payer's perspective*, as the payer's budget is affected by the price $P$, not the manufacturer's cost $c$.\n\n3.  **Net Monetary Benefit (NMB)**: The NMB is the difference between the monetized value of the benefits and the costs from the perspective of the decision-maker, in this case, the payer.\n    $$NMB = B - Cost_{payer}$$\n    Substituting the expressions derived in the previous steps gives the formal expression for the payer's NMB:\n    $$NMB = (\\lambda \\times Q) - P$$\n\nWe now proceed to compute the value of the NMB using the data provided in the problem statement:\n-   Expected incremental QALY gain: $Q = 19.1$\n-   Willingness-to-pay threshold: $\\lambda = 110{,}000$ USD per QALY\n-   Monopolist price: $P = 1{,}942{,}370$ USD\n\nFirst, we calculate the total monetary value of the health benefit ($B$):\n$$B = (\\lambda \\times Q) = 110{,}000 \\times 19.1 = 2{,}101{,}000$$\nThe benefit is valued at $2{,}101{,}000$ USD.\n\nNext, we subtract the price $P$ from this benefit to find the NMB:\n$$NMB = 2{,}101{,}000 - 1{,}942{,}370$$\n$$NMB = 158{,}630$$\nThe calculated NMB is $158{,}630$ USD.
