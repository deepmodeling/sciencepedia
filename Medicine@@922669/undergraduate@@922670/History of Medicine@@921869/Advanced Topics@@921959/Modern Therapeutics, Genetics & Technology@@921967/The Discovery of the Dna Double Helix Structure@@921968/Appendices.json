The genetic material of this particle has been isolated. Initial enzymatic assays confirm that the molecule is a form of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA). A quantitative base composition analysis was performed on a purified sample of this DNA, yielding the following molar percentages of the nitrogenous bases:\n- Adenine (A): 21.5%\n- Guanine (G): 38.5%\n- Cytosine (C): 18.0%\n- Thymine (T): 22.0%\n\nBased on these results, which of the following statements provides the most accurate inference about the structure of the genetic material in this extraterrestrial particle?\n\nA. The genetic material is a double-stranded DNA molecule.\n\nB. The genetic material is a single-stranded DNA molecule.\n\nC. The genetic material is a double-stranded Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) molecule.\n\nD. The composition analysis is flawed, as the percentages of Guanine and Cytosine must be equal in any DNA molecule.\n\nE. The genetic material is likely a hybrid molecule composed of one DNA strand and one RNA strand.", "solution": "Define the observed molar base fractions as $f_{\\mathrm{A}}=0.215$, $f_{\\mathrm{G}}=0.385$, $f_{\\mathrm{C}}=0.18$, and $f_{\\mathrm{T}}=0.22$. Note that the total is\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{A}}+f_{\\mathrm{G}}+f_{\\mathrm{C}}+f_{\\mathrm{T}}=0.215+0.385+0.18+0.22=1,\n$$\nso the compositional analysis is internally consistent.\n\nPhysical principle (Chargaff’s rules for double-stranded DNA): In canonical Watson–Crick base-paired, double-stranded DNA, hydrogen bonding imposes base-pairing constraints yielding\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{A}}=f_{\\mathrm{T}}, \\quad f_{\\mathrm{G}}=f_{\\mathrm{C}}.\n$$\nApplying this to the data:\n- For adenine and thymine, $f_{\\mathrm{A}}=0.215$ and $f_{\\mathrm{T}}=0.22$, so $f_{\\mathrm{A}}\\approx f_{\\mathrm{T}}$.\n- For guanine and cytosine, $f_{\\mathrm{G}}=0.385$ and $f_{\\mathrm{C}}=0.18$, so\n$$\n|f_{\\mathrm{G}}-f_{\\mathrm{C}}|=0.385-0.18=0.205,\n$$\nwhich is a large deviation and violates $f_{\\mathrm{G}}=f_{\\mathrm{C}}$ required for double-stranded DNA.\n\nTherefore, the data are inconsistent with a double-stranded DNA molecule, ruling out option A. The same constraint $f_{\\mathrm{G}}=f_{\\mathrm{C}}$ applies to double-stranded RNA (with $f_{\\mathrm{A}}=f_{\\mathrm{U}}$ rather than $f_{\\mathrm{A}}=f_{\\mathrm{T}}$), and moreover RNA contains uracil rather than thymine; the enzymatic assays identified DNA and the composition includes thymine, so option C is incompatible.\n\nRegarding option D, the statement that guanine and cytosine percentages must be equal in any DNA molecule is false: this equality is required only for double-stranded DNA. Single-stranded DNA does not have obligatory base-pairing constraints across the entire molecule, so its base composition can exhibit $f_{\\mathrm{G}}\\ne f_{\\mathrm{C}}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{A}}\\ne f_{\\mathrm{T}}$.\n\nOption E suggests a DNA–RNA hybrid. The assays specifically confirmed DNA, and the base composition shows thymine (not uracil), providing no evidence for RNA content in the genetic material sample analyzed.\n\nPhysical inference: In single-stranded DNA, there is no global requirement that $f_{\\mathrm{A}}=f_{\\mathrm{T}}$ or $f_{\\mathrm{G}}=f_{\\mathrm{C}}$, so the observed asymmetric composition, particularly $f_{\\mathrm{G}}\\gg f_{\\mathrm{C}}$, is consistent with a single-stranded DNA genome.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate inference is that the genetic material is a single-stranded DNA molecule.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1487261"}, {"introduction": "The final breakthrough in determining DNA's structure came from interpreting X-ray diffraction images, particularly those generated by Rosalind Franklin and her student Raymond Gosling. This practice puts you in the role of a structural biologist, translating the key geometric information contained in those patterns into concrete parameters of the helical model. You will use the helical pitch and base pair spacing to deduce the number of base pairs per turn, a cornerstone calculation in the development of the B-form DNA model [@problem_id:4767481].", "problem": "In reconstructing the reasoning behind the proposal of the double-helical structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), use the following historically grounded observations from X-ray diffraction (XRD) of DNA fibers reported in the early 1950s: (i) the axial repeat (helical pitch) is approximately $34\\,\\text{\\AA}$, inferred from the spacing of the first strong layer line in the diffraction pattern; (ii) the stacked planar base pairs are spaced axially by approximately $3.4\\,\\text{\\AA}$, inferred from a strong meridional reflection corresponding to the repeat distance along the fiber axis. Assume a uniform right-handed helix in which one complete turn corresponds to an angular advance of $2\\pi$ radians over one pitch distance. From these facts alone, derive the helical twist per base pair and evaluate it numerically. Then, using your calculation, explain how this implies an integer-like count of base pairs per full helical turn consistent with the historical model-building. Express the twist per base pair in radians and round your numerical answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the helical pitch, which is the axial distance for one complete turn of the helix, be denoted by $P$. From the problem statement, we are given $P \\approx 34\\,\\text{\\AA}$.\nLet the axial distance between consecutive stacked base pairs be denoted by $h$. We are given $h \\approx 3.4\\,\\text{\\AA}$.\nLet $N$ be the number of base pairs contained within one full helical turn.\n\nThe total axial length of one full turn, $P$, must be equal to the number of base pairs in that turn, $N$, multiplied by the axial length contributed by each base pair, $h$. This gives the fundamental relationship:\n$$P = N \\times h$$\n\nFrom this equation, we can determine the number of base pairs per turn, $N$, by rearranging the formula:\n$$N = \\frac{P}{h}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$N = \\frac{34\\,\\text{\\AA}}{3.4\\,\\text{\\AA}} = 10$$\n\nThis calculation reveals a critical insight from the X-ray diffraction data: the ratio of the helical pitch to the base pair separation is an integer, $10$. This implies that there are exactly $10$ base pairs per full turn of the helix. The fact that this ratio is a simple integer strongly supports a model of a regular, repeating helical structure, which was a cornerstone of the Watson-Crick model. A non-integer number of subunits per turn would imply a more complex or non-repeating structure, inconsistent with the simple diffraction pattern observed.\n\nNext, we are asked to derive the helical twist per base pair. A full helical turn corresponds to a total angular rotation of $2\\pi$ radians. This total rotation is distributed evenly among the $N$ base pairs that constitute the turn. Let $\\theta$ represent the helical twist, or the angle of rotation between one base pair and the next. We can calculate $\\theta$ by dividing the total angle of a turn by the number of base pairs in that turn:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi}{N}$$\n\nSubstituting the value $N=10$ that we derived:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi}{10} = \\frac{\\pi}{5}\\,\\text{radians}$$\n\nThis is the exact analytical expression for the helical twist per base pair based on the provided data. To evaluate this numerically as requested, we use the value of $\\pi$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{5} \\approx \\frac{3.14159265...}{5} \\approx 0.6283185... \\,\\text{radians}$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the numerical answer to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $6$, $2$, and $8$. The fourth digit is $3$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., we do not change the third digit).\nTherefore, the helical twist per base pair is approximately $0.628$ radians.\n\nIn summary, the derivation proceeds by first establishing the number of base pairs per helical turn, $N$, as the ratio of the pitch, $P$, to the inter-base-pair spacing, $h$. The resulting integer value, $N=10$, is a significant finding that points to a regular structure with $10$-fold symmetry around the helical axis. The helical twist per base pair, $\\theta$, is then found by dividing the full circle angular measure, $2\\pi$, by this integer $N$.
