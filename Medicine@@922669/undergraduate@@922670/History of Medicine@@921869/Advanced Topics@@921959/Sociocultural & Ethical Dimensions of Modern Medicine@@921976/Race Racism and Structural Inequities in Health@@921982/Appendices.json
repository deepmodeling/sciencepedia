Historical public health records indicate marked disparities in pediatric asthma outcomes linked to neighborhood-level access to preventive care and environmental exposures (for example, traffic-related air pollution and older housing stock with persistent indoor allergens). Consider a one-year community study that sampled two neighborhood groups:\n\n- Group 1: Residents of historically redlined neighborhoods that received fewer investments in clinical infrastructure.\n- Group 2: Residents of non-redlined neighborhoods with comparatively greater access to primary care and environmental remediation.\n\nThe study’s $2\\times2$ table, for a one-year observation of pediatric asthma hospitalizations (defined as at least one hospitalization during the year), reports the following counts:\n- Cases in Group $1$: $a=24$\n- Non-cases in Group $1$: $b=76$\n- Cases in Group $2$: $c=12$\n- Non-cases in Group $2$: $d=88$\n\nStarting from core epidemiologic definitions appropriate to this historical health context:\n- The one-year risk in any group equals the number of cases in that group divided by the total number of individuals observed in that group over the year.\n- The relative risk between two groups equals the ratio of those risks.\n- The risk difference equals the difference of those risks.\n\nUse these definitions to derive expressions for the one-year risk in each group, the relative risk, and the risk difference, and then compute their values for the data above.

The study compares a group from historically redlined neighborhoods (Group $1$) with a group from non-redlined neighborhoods (Group $2$). The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in epidemiology, well-posed, and objective.\n\nFirst, we formalize the given quantities. Let $a$ be the number of cases (hospitalized children) and $b$ be the number of non-cases in Group $1$. Let $c$ be the number of cases and $d$ be the number of non-cases in Group $2$.\nThe given data are:\n- $a = 24$\n- $b = 76$\n- $c = 12$\n- $d = 88$\n\nThe total number of individuals observed in each group are:\n- Total in Group $1$: $N_1 = a + b = 24 + 76 = 100$\n- Total in Group $2$: $N_2 = c + d = 12 + 88 = 100$\n\nThe problem defines the one-year risk in a group as the number of cases divided by the total number of individuals in that group. We denote the risk in Group $1$ as $R_1$ and in Group $2$ as $R_2$.\n\nThe expression for the risk in Group $1$ is:\n$$R_1 = \\frac{a}{a+b}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R_1 = \\frac{24}{24+76} = \\frac{24}{100} = 0.24$$\n\nThe expression for the risk in Group $2$ is:\n$$R_2 = \\frac{c}{c+d}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R_2 = \\frac{12}{12+88} = \\frac{12}{100} = 0.12$$\n\nNext, we address the measures of association. The problem defines relative risk ($RR$) as the ratio of the risks.\nThe expression for the relative risk is:\n$$RR = \\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \\frac{a / (a+b)}{c / (c+d)}$$\nUsing the computed risk values:\n$$RR = \\frac{0.24}{0.12} = 2$$\n\nThe problem defines risk difference ($RD$) as the difference between the risks.\nThe expression for the risk difference is:\n$$RD = R_1 - R_2 = \\frac{a}{a+b} - \\frac{c}{c+d}$$\nUsing the computed risk values:\n$$RD = 0.24 - 0.12 = 0.12$$\n\nThe problem asks for an explanation of how each measure supports the interpretation of structural inequities in this historical setting. The relative risk ($RR$) is a measure of the strength of association. An $RR$ of $2$ indicates that children in the historically redlined neighborhoods (Group $1$) had twice the risk of being hospitalized for asthma compared to children in the non-redlined neighborhoods (Group $2$). This metric highlights the magnitude of the disparity in relative terms, emphasizing how much more likely the adverse outcome is for the disadvantaged group. It is a powerful tool for establishing an etiologic link, suggesting that the constellation of factors associated with redlining (e.g., environmental exposures, lack of access to care) are strongly connected to the health outcome.\n\nThe risk difference ($RD$), also known as the attributable risk, is an absolute measure of impact. An $RD$ of $0.12$ signifies an excess risk of $12$ hospitalizations per $100$ children in Group $1$ that is attributable to the conditions differentiating Group $1$ from Group $2$. This metric is crucial for public health planning and resource allocation. It quantifies the absolute burden of disease on the affected community. In the context of structural inequity, the $RD$ translates the relative disparity into a tangible number of excess cases, illustrating the concrete public health consequences of historical discriminatory practices. It answers the question: \"How many cases could be prevented in the exposed group if their risk were lowered to that of the unexposed group?\" In this case, $12$ hospitalizations per $100$ children could have been averted.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the computation of the single numeric quantity $RR - RD$.\nUsing the calculated values:\n$$RR - RD = 2 - 0.12 = 1.88$$\nThis quantity is dimensionless, as requested.

In your reasoning, explain why direct age standardization is necessary for fair comparison between these racial groups in the historical context given the presence of structural inequities that shape age distributions and observed mortality.", "solution": "**Rationale for Direct Age Standardization**\n\nDirect age standardization is necessary for a fair comparison of mortality between Group B and Group W due to the confounding effect of age distribution. A crude mortality rate is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths in a population by the total person-years of that population. This measure is a weighted average of the age-specific mortality rates, where the weights are the proportion of the population in each age group.\n\nThe problem statement posits that structural inequities have shaped different age distributions for these groups. Historically, marginalized populations, such as Group B, often have a younger age structure. This can be due to higher fertility rates and higher mortality rates at younger ages, leading to a smaller proportion of the population surviving to older ages.\n\nMortality risk is strongly dependent on age. If Group B has a younger population structure than Group W, its crude mortality rate might appear lower than, or artificially close to, that of Group W, even if its age-specific mortality rates are higher in every single age category. This is because a larger proportion of its population is in the low-mortality younger age groups, which pulls down the overall crude rate. This would create a misleading picture of the relative mortality burden.\n\nDirect age standardization corrects for this confounding by age. The method involves applying the age-specific mortality rates from each of the two groups to a single, common standard population. This process yields the number of deaths that would be expected in the standard population if it experienced the mortality rates of Group B, and likewise for Group W. The resulting age-standardized rates are hypothetical rates that answer the question: \"What would the overall mortality rate be for each group if they both had the same age structure as the standard population?\" By removing the effect of differing age distributions, this method allows for a more accurate and fair comparison of the underlying mortality risks between the populations. The observed disparity in age-specific rates is starker, with Group B having higher mortality in every age stratum. Standardization will reveal the true extent of this disparity in a single summary measure.\n\n**Calculation of Age-Standardized Mortality Rates**\n\nLet the age strata be indexed by $i = 1, 2, 3, 4$, corresponding to ages $0$–$14$, $15$–$44$, $45$–$64$, and $\\geq 65$.\nLet $m_{B,i}$ and $m_{W,i}$ be the age-specific mortality rates for Group B and Group W, respectively, in stratum $i$, expressed as deaths per person-year. The given rates are per $100{,}000$ person-years, so we must divide by $100{,}000$.\nLet $P_{S,i}$ be the person-years in the standard population for stratum $i$.\n\nThe total person-years in the standard population, $P_S$, is:\n$$ P_S = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} P_{S,i} = 300{,}000 + 500{,}000 + 250{,}000 + 150{,}000 = 1{,}200{,}000 $$\n\nThe number of expected deaths ($D$) in the standard population for a given group is calculated by summing the product of the age-specific rates and the standard population counts for each stratum:\n$$ D = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} m_i \\times P_{S,i} $$\nThe age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) is then the total number of expected deaths divided by the total standard population, typically expressed per $100{,}000$ person-years.\n$$ \\text{ASMR} = \\left( \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{4} m_i \\times P_{S,i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{4} P_{S,i}} \\right) \\times 100{,}000 $$\n\n**1.

Consider two groups of advanced-undergraduate research participants sampled at identical time points after waking: a group experiencing high chronic exposures to structural racism (Group S) and a group with comparatively lower chronic exposures (Group L).

HPA axis dysregulation, as might be modeled by the weathering hypothesis, can lead to a \"flatter\" profile.

For Group S, while the morning peak is lower, the cortisol levels remain more elevated throughout the day compared to Group L. This sustained elevation leads to a larger total AUC ($\\text{AUC}_S = 132.8$ vs. $\\text{AUC}_L = 115.3$).
