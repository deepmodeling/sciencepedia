A solution will be derived from first principles as specified.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires calculating the time delay, $\\Delta t$, between the triggering of a nephrology referral in two different systems: one using a race-neutral eGFR and another using a race-adjusted eGFR.\n\nLet the referral threshold for eGFR be $E_{\\mathrm{threshold}} = 60$ milliliters per minute per $1.73$ m$^{2}$. A referral is triggered the first time the reported eGFR falls below this value.\n\nFirst, consider the race-neutral system. The reported eGFR at time $t$ is given by the function:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{neutral}}(t) = E_0 - rt$$\nThe given values are $E_0 = 59$ and $r = 3$ units per year. At the initial time $t=0$, the eGFR is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{neutral}}(0) = E_0 - r(0) = 59$$\nSince $E_{\\mathrm{neutral}}(0) = 59 < E_{\\mathrm{threshold}} = 60$, the condition for referral is met at the very beginning of the observation period. Therefore, the referral time for the race-neutral system, $t_1$, is:\n$$t_1 = 0 \\text{ years}$$\n\nNext, consider the race-adjusted system. The reported eGFR for a patient classified as Black is given by:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{race}}(t) = k \\cdot E_{\\mathrm{neutral}}(t)$$\nwhere $k = 1.16$. Substituting the expression for $E_{\\mathrm{neutral}}(t)$, we have:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{race}}(t) = k(E_0 - rt)$$\nAt the initial time $t=0$, the race-adjusted eGFR is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{race}}(0) = k \\cdot E_0 = 1.16 \\times 59 = 68.44$$\nSince $E_{\\mathrm{race}}(0) = 68.44 > E_{\\mathrm{threshold}} = 60$, the referral is not triggered at $t=0$. The referral will be triggered at a later time, $t_2$, when the eGFR first falls below the threshold. As $E_{\\mathrm{race}}(t)$ is a continuous and decreasing function of time, this occurs precisely when $E_{\\mathrm{race}}(t_2) = E_{\\mathrm{threshold}}$.\n$$k(E_0 - rt_2) = E_{\\mathrm{threshold}}$$\nWe now solve this equation for $t_2$.\n$$E_0 - rt_2 = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{threshold}}}{k}$$\n$$rt_2 = E_0 - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{threshold}}}{k}$$\n$$t_2 = \\frac{1}{r} \\left( E_0 - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{threshold}}}{k} \\right)$$\n\nThe delay in referral, $\\Delta t$, is the difference between the two referral times:\n$$\\Delta t = t_2 - t_1$$\nSince $t_1 = 0$, the delay is simply:\n$$\\Delta t = t_2 = \\frac{1}{r} \\left( E_0 - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{threshold}}}{k} \\right)$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided in the problem statement: $E_0 = 59$, $r=3$, $E_{\\mathrm{threshold}}=60$, and $k=1.16$.\n$$\\Delta t = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( 59 - \\frac{60}{1.16} \\right)$$\nFirst, we calculate the quotient:\n$$\\frac{60}{1.16} \\approx 51.7241379...$$\nNext, we perform the subtraction inside the parentheses:\n$$59 - 51.7241379... \\approx 7.2758620...$$\nFinally, we divide by $r=3$:\n$$\\Delta t = \\frac{7.2758620...}{3} \\approx 2.4252873... \\text{ years}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\Delta t \\approx 2.425 \\text{ years}$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2.425}\n$$", "id": "4763904"}, {"introduction": "Race-based adjustments not only affect individual timelines but also have probabilistic consequences at the population level, leading to systematic under-diagnosis.

Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) is commonly evaluated relative to a predicted value derived from reference equations. Consider a scenario in which two populations (for example, Black and White patients) have identical distributions of true measured FEV1 relative to the non-corrected predicted FEV1.

This simplification focuses on the screening impact of the FEV1 threshold; it isolates how race correction affects the proportion flagged, given identical underlying physiology across groups.\n\nHistorically, a “race correction” has been applied for Black patients by lowering the predicted FEV1 by a fixed multiplicative factor. Model this practice by setting the corrected predicted FEV1 equal to $c \\times \\text{FEV1}_{\\text{predicted, non-corrected}}$ with $c = 0.9$ (a ten percent reduction).
