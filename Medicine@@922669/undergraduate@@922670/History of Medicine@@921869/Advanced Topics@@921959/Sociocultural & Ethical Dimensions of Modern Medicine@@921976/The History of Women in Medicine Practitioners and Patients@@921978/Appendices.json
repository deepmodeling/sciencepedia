This exercise uses a hypothetical scenario of a medical college introducing coeducation to illustrate a fundamental concept: the compositional effect [@problem_id:4773343].

At the time of the policy change, female enrollment was $F_0 = 0$ and male enrollment was $M_0 = 200$. After $5$ years, female enrollment rose to $F_5 = 30$, while male enrollment remained constant at $M_5 = 200$.

Round your answer to $4$ significant figures. Then, using quantitative reasoning grounded in these definitions, explain how holding male enrollment constant while female enrollment rises creates a compositional effect in the observed shares, and identify which terms in the numerator and denominator of the share expression are driving the change. Express the female share as a decimal (not a percentage). No units are required.", "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on fundamental arithmetic principles and definitions, providing all necessary data for a unique solution.\n\nLet $F(t)$ and $M(t)$ denote the female and male enrollment, respectively, at time $t$ years after the policy change in $1890$. Let $T(t)$ be the total enrollment and $S_F(t)$ be the female share of total enrollment at time $t$.\n\nThe givens are:\n- Initial enrollments at $t=0$: $F_0 = F(0) = 0$ and $M_0 = M(0) = 200$.\n- Enrollments after $t=5$ years: $F_5 = F(5) = 30$ and $M_5 = M(5) = 200$.\n\nThe problem provides two core definitions:\n(i) Total enrollment is the sum of group enrollments: $T(t) = F(t) + M(t)$.\n(ii) A group's share is its enrollment divided by total enrollment. The female share is therefore $S_F(t) = \\frac{F(t)}{T(t)}$.\n\nCombining these definitions, the expression for the female share is:\n$$S_F(t) = \\frac{F(t)}{F(t) + M(t)}$$\n\nFirst, we compute the female share of total enrollment after $5$ years, $S_F(5)$.\nUsing the given values for $t=5$:\n$$F(5) = 30$$\n$$M(5) = 200$$\n\nThe total enrollment at $t=5$ is:\n$$T(5) = F(5) + M(5) = 30 + 200 = 230$$\n\nThe female share of total enrollment at $t=5$ is:\n$$S_F(5) = \\frac{F(5)}{T(5)} = \\frac{30}{230} = \\frac{3}{23}$$\n\nTo express this as a decimal rounded to $4$ significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$S_F(5) = \\frac{3}{23} \\approx 0.13043478...$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures gives $0.1304$.\n\nNext, we use quantitative reasoning to explain the compositional effect. A compositional effect occurs when the relative proportions of subgroups within a population change, leading to a change in the overall properties of the population, even if some subgroups remain constant in absolute size.\n\nThe female share is $S_F(t) = \\frac{F(t)}{F(t) + M(t)}$. In the period from $t=0$ to $t=5$, female enrollment $F(t)$ increases from $0$ to $30$, while male enrollment $M(t)$ is held constant at $200$. The change in $S_F(t)$ is determined by the variable $F(t)$ appearing in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nThe terms driving the change are as follows:\n- **Numerator:** The term is $F(t)$. As $F(t)$ increases, the numerator increases. This effect, in isolation, would increase the value of the share $S_F(t)$.\n- **Denominator:** The expression is $F(t) + M(t)$. The term that changes is $F(t)$. As $F(t)$ increases, the denominator, representing total enrollment, also increases. This effect, in isolation, would decrease the value of the share $S_F(t)$.\n\nThe net result is an increase in the female share, as confirmed by our calculation ($S_F(0) = \\frac{0}{0+200}=0$ and $S_F(5) \\approx 0.1304$). We can formalize this by examining the derivative of $S_F$ with respect to $F$, holding $M$ constant:\n$$\\frac{dS_F}{dF} = \\frac{d}{dF}\\left(\\frac{F}{F+M}\\right) = \\frac{(1)(F+M) - (F)(1)}{(F+M)^2} = \\frac{M}{(F+M)^2}$$\nSince $M=200 > 0$ and the denominator $(F+M)^2$ is always positive, the derivative $\\frac{dS_F}{dF}$ is always positive. This rigorously shows that as female enrollment $F$ increases, the female share $S_F$ must also increase.\n\nThe compositional effect is evident in how the share of the *constant* group changes. The male share is $S_M(t) = \\frac{M(t)}{F(t) + M(t)}$. Although male enrollment $M(t)$ is constant at $200$, the male share decreases as $F(t)$ increases because the denominator grows.\n- At $t=0$: $S_M(0) = \\frac{200}{0+200} = 1$.\n- At $t=5$: $S_M(5) = \\frac{200}{30+200} = \\frac{200}{230} \\approx 0.8696$.\nThe increase in one component ($F$) has changed the composition of the whole student body, thereby reducing the proportional representation ($S_M$) of the other component, even though its absolute size ($M$) was unchanged. This is the essence of the compositional effect. The change is driven by the term for female enrollment, $F(t)$, which appears in both the numerator and denominator of the share expression.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1304}\n$$", "id": "4773343"}, {"introduction": "As women expanded their roles as practitioners, particularly in fields like nursing, it is crucial to assess their impact on patient outcomes.

These are core metrics used to assess the effect of an intervention or exposure. The scenario, while historical, presents a standard biostatistical calculation. It is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data to calculate the relative risk. The question is clear, and a unique, meaningful solution exists. The provided assumptions about comparability and stable risk are crucial for framing the problem and ensuring the interpretation is valid within the problem's context.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, precise language. It asks for a calculation and a standard interpretation based on that calculation, free of subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is deemed valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions, missing information, or logical flaws. The solution process can proceed.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of the relative risk and an assessment of the intervention's effect.\n\nLet $I_1$ be the incidence proportion of readmission in the group exposed to the intervention, which is the cohort of patients in the nurse-led clinic year. The problem states this is $I_1 = 10\\%$.\nLet $I_0$ be the incidence proportion of readmission in the unexposed (or control) group, which is the cohort of patients from the pre-implementation year. The problem states this is $I_0 = 15\\%$.\n\nIt is standard to express these proportions as decimal values for calculation:\n$I_1 = 0.10$\n$I_0 = 0.15$\n\nThe number of patients in each cohort is given as $N = 1000$. This allows for the calculation of the number of readmission events in each year.\nNumber of readmissions in the pre-implementation year: $C_0 = I_0 \\times N = 0.15 \\times 1000 = 150$.\nNumber of readmissions in the nurse-led clinic year: $C_1 = I_1 \\times N = 0.10 \\times 1000 = 100$.\n\nThe relative risk, denoted as $RR$, is defined as the ratio of the incidence proportion in the exposed group to the incidence proportion in the unexposed group.\n$$RR = \\frac{I_1}{I_0}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$RR = \\frac{0.10}{0.15}$$\nTo express this as an exact fraction, we can write the decimal values as fractions or multiply the numerator and denominator by a common factor to eliminate the decimal points.\n$$RR = \\frac{10}{15}$$\nSimplifying this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $5$:\n$$RR = \\frac{10 \\div 5}{15 \\div 5} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nThe relative risk of readmission for patients in the nurse-led clinic year compared with the pre-implementation year is $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nThe second part of the task is to assess whether the observed effect implies benefit or harm. This assessment is based on comparing the calculated relative risk to $1$.\n-   If $RR = 1$, the risk in the exposed group is the same as the risk in the unexposed group, implying no effect from the intervention.\n-   If $RR > 1$, the risk in the exposed group is greater than the risk in the unexposed group, implying a harmful effect from the intervention.\n-   If $RR < 1$, the risk in the exposed group is less than the risk in the unexposed group, implying a beneficial or protective effect from the intervention.\n\nIn this case, the calculated relative risk is $RR = \\frac{2}{3}$. Since $\\frac{2}{3} < 1$, the risk of postpartum readmission was lower in the year with the nurse-led clinics than in the year before their implementation. This implies that, under the given assumptions of patient comparability and stable underlying risk, the nurse-led clinics had a beneficial effect, reducing the risk of readmission. Specifically, the risk of readmission in the clinic year was two-thirds of the risk in the pre-clinic year.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$$", "id": "4773301"}, {"introduction": "The experience of women as patients has historically been shaped by gender-laden diagnoses like \"hysteria,\" which could obscure underlying physical illness.

It is a well-posed question in applied probability and epidemiology, grounded in a historically plausible context.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem uses standard definitions from epidemiology (conditional proportion) and concepts from the history of medicine (\"hysteria,\" \"diagnostic overshadowing\"). It does not violate any scientific or mathematical principles.\n- **Well-Posed:** All necessary data for the calculation are provided. The term \"misdiagnosis proportion\" is explicitly defined in a way that maps directly to a conditional probability calculation, ensuring a unique and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is phrased objectively, presenting data and a definition to be used in a calculation and subsequent interpretation.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe primary task is to calculate the \"misdiagnosis proportion among those with pelvic pain\". The problem defines this as a conditional proportion. Let $A$ be the event that a woman in the case series presents with pelvic pain. Let $B$ be the event that a woman in the case series receives a subsequent organic diagnosis that explains her symptoms. The problem asks for the misdiagnosis proportion among those with pelvic pain, which is the probability of event $B$ occurring given that event $A$ has already occurred. This is the conditional probability $P(B|A)$.\n\nThe number of women who presented with pelvic pain provides the size of our sample space for this conditional calculation. This is given as $N(A) = N_{pp} = 60$.\n\nThe number of women within this specific group who were later found to have an organic diagnosis is the number of outcomes of interest. This is given as $N(A \\cap B) = N_{od} = 30$.\n\nThe conditional probability $P(B|A)$ is calculated as the ratio of the number of joint occurrences of events $A$ and $B$ to the number of occurrences of event $A$.\n$$\nP(B|A) = \\frac{N(A \\cap B)}{N(A)}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nP(B|A) = \\frac{30}{60}\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction gives:\n$$\nP(B|A) = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\n$$\nThus, the misdiagnosis proportion among those who presented with pelvic pain is $0.5$. The total number of women in the study, $N_{total} = 200$, is contextual information and not required for this specific calculation, which is conditioned on the sub-population with pelvic pain.\n\nThe second part of the task is to articulate how this computed proportion informs our understanding of \"diagnostic overshadowing\". The problem states that diagnostic overshadowing occurs when a salient psychosocial label (here, \"hysteria\") affects the clinical interpretation of symptoms.\n\nThe calculated misdiagnosis proportion of $0.5$ provides strong quantitative evidence for the phenomenon of diagnostic overshadowing in this historical context. A proportion of $0.5$ means that $50\\%$ of the women who were initially diagnosed with \"hysteria\" but also presented with the distinct physical symptom of pelvic pain were, in fact, suffering from an unrecognized organic disease.\n\nThis high proportion suggests that the label of \"hysteria\" acted as a powerful cognitive bias for the clinicians. Instead of treating pelvic pain as a symptom requiring a thorough differential diagnosis to rule out physical pathologies, the pain was likely reinterpreted as a somatic manifestation of the presumed psychological disorder. The \"hysteria\" diagnosis overshadowed the physical complaint, leading to a failure to investigate or correctly identify an underlying organic cause in half of the cases. This quantifies the tangible harm of such a diagnostic practice, demonstrating how a potent, gender-laden psychosocial label could systematically impede proper medical evaluation and lead to significant rates of misdiagnosis for women's health issues.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5}\n$$", "id": "4773297"}]}
