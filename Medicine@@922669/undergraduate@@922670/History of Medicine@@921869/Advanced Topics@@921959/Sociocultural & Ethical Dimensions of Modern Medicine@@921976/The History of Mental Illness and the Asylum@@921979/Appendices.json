This exercise demonstrates how to use fundamental demographic principles to bridge this gap.

Over a stable year with no net growth or shrinkage of the resident population, the institution reports $1{,}200$ admissions, of which $0.40$ are diagnosed with psychosis at the time of admission, and an average daily census of $2{,}400$ residents. Historians sometimes wish to translate such flow measures into a stock measure such as the point prevalence of psychosis within the asylum on a particular census date (for example, mid-year).\n\nStarting only from core definitions in demography and epidemiology (for example, the definitions of point prevalence, incidence/admissions as a flow, and conservation of persons in a steady state), and without invoking any pre-packaged shortcut formulas, do the following:\n\n- State explicitly the additional assumption(s) you will adopt to render the point prevalence computation well-defined from the available flow and census data in a historically realistic, steady-state asylum.\n- Under the historically common simplifying assumption that the mean length of stay is the same for residents with psychosis and for residents without psychosis, compute the point prevalence of psychosis inside the asylum on the mid-year census date as a decimal fraction. Round your final prevalence to four significant figures.\n- Briefly explain, in one or two sentences, how the numerator–denominator problem arises if one tries to mix flows (admissions) and stocks (census) without appropriate assumptions, and why differences in mean length of stay by diagnosis would bias a naive calculation.\n\nExpress the requested prevalence as a unitless decimal fraction and adhere to the rounding instruction. Do not use a percentage sign.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the point prevalence of psychosis within a steady-state asylum population, derived from flow (admissions) and stock (census) data. This involves stating the necessary assumptions, performing the calculation under a specific simplifying condition, and explaining potential pitfalls in such calculations.\n\nFirst, we define the variables and core concepts based on the provided information.\nLet $A_{total}$ be the total annual admissions, given as $1{,}200 \\text{ persons/year}$.\nLet $N_{total}$ be the average daily census (the total resident population), given as $2{,}400 \\text{ persons}$.\nLet $f_{psy}$ be the fraction of admissions diagnosed with psychosis, given as $0.40$.\nThe system is in a steady state, meaning the population size and its composition are constant over the year.\n\nThe point prevalence of a condition is the proportion of the population that has the condition at a specific point in time. For psychosis, the point prevalence $P_{psy}$ is:\n$$ P_{psy} = \\frac{N_{psy}}{N_{total}} $$\nwhere $N_{psy}$ is the number of residents with psychosis on the census date. Our goal is to find $N_{psy}$.\n\n**Additional Assumptions to Render the Computation Well-Defined**\n\nThe primary assumption, provided in the problem, is that the system is in a **steady state**. This is a crucial assumption from demography, which implies that for the population as a whole, and for any stable sub-population, the rate of inflow equals the rate of outflow.\n$$ \\text{Rate of inflow} = \\text{Rate of outflow} $$\nIn this context, inflow is the admission rate, and outflow is the rate of discharge or death.\n\nFrom this steady-state principle, we can derive a fundamental relationship connecting the stock of individuals with a certain characteristic ($N$), the flow of new individuals entering that state ($A$, the incidence rate), and the average duration they spend in that state ($D$, the mean length of stay). This relationship, analogous to Little's Law in queuing theory, is:\n$$ N = A \\times D $$\nThis equation is the key additional assumption, or more accurately, the core operational principle derived from the steady-state condition, that makes the problem solvable. It must hold for the total population and for any subgroup, such as those with and without psychosis.\n\nFor the total population: $N_{total} = A_{total} \\times D_{avg}$, where $D_{avg}$ is the mean length of stay for any resident.\nFor the psychosis subgroup: $N_{psy} = A_{psy} \\times D_{psy}$, where $A_{psy}$ is the admission rate for psychosis and $D_{psy}$ is their mean length of stay.\nFor the non-psychosis subgroup: $N_{non-psy} = A_{non-psy} \\times D_{non-psy}$.\n\n**Computation of Point Prevalence**\n\nWe are asked to compute the point prevalence under the simplifying assumption that the mean length of stay is a constant $D$ for all residents, regardless of diagnosis. That is:\n$$ D_{psy} = D_{non-psy} = D $$\nLet's first determine this common length of stay, $D$. For the total system, the average length of stay $D_{avg}$ relates the total census to total admissions.\n$N_{total} = N_{psy} + N_{non-psy}$\n$A_{total} \\times D_{avg} = (A_{psy} \\times D_{psy}) + (A_{non-psy} \\times D_{non-psy})$\nSubstituting the assumption $D_{psy} = D_{non-psy} = D$:\n$A_{total} \\times D_{avg} = (A_{psy} \\times D) + (A_{non-psy} \\times D) = (A_{psy} + A_{non-psy}) \\times D$\nSince $A_{total} = A_{psy} + A_{non-psy}$, we have:\n$A_{total} \\times D_{avg} = A_{total} \\times D$, which implies $D_{avg} = D$.\n\nWe can calculate this mean length of stay from the total population data:\n$$ D = D_{avg} = \\frac{N_{total}}{A_{total}} = \\frac{2{,}400 \\text{ persons}}{1{,}200 \\text{ persons/year}} = 2 \\text{ years} $$\nNext, we find the number of residents with psychosis, $N_{psy}$. The admission rate for psychosis, $A_{psy}$, is:\n$$ A_{psy} = f_{psy} \\times A_{total} = 0.40 \\times 1{,}200 \\text{ persons/year} = 480 \\text{ persons/year} $$\nUsing the steady-state relationship for the psychosis subgroup and the common length of stay $D=2 \\text{ years}$:\n$$ N_{psy} = A_{psy} \\times D_{psy} = A_{psy} \\times D = (480 \\text{ persons/year}) \\times (2 \\text{ years}) = 960 \\text{ persons} $$\nNow we can compute the point prevalence of psychosis:\n$$ P_{psy} = \\frac{N_{psy}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{960}{2{,}400} = \\frac{96}{240} = \\frac{4}{10} = 0.4 $$\nAlternatively, working symbolically, the prevalence is:\n$$ P_{psy} = \\frac{N_{psy}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{A_{psy} \\times D_{psy}}{A_{total} \\times D_{avg}} $$\nUnder the assumption $D_{psy} = D_{avg} = D$, this simplifies to:\n$$ P_{psy} = \\frac{A_{psy} \\times D}{A_{total} \\times D} = \\frac{A_{psy}}{A_{total}} = \\frac{f_{psy} \\times A_{total}}{A_{total}} = f_{psy} $$\nThus, when the mean length of stay is uniform across all groups, the prevalence of a characteristic in the stock (census) is equal to the proportion of that characteristic in the inflow (admissions).\n$$ P_{psy} = 0.40 $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the result is $0.4000$.\n\n**Explanation of the Numerator-Denominator Problem and Bias**\n\nThe numerator-denominator problem arises when one naively attempts to calculate prevalence by mixing measures of flow and stock, for instance, by dividing the annual number of admissions with psychosis ($A_{psy}$, a flow) by the average daily census ($N_{total}$, a stock). This ratio, $A_{psy}/N_{total}$, is dimensionally inconsistent (persons/year divided by persons, yielding a result in units of inverse time, year$^{-1}$) and does not represent a dimensionless proportion or prevalence.\n\nThis naive approach is biased because it ignores the crucial role of the length of stay ($D$). If the mean length of stay for residents with psychosis ($D_{psy}$) differs from the average length of stay for all residents ($D_{avg}$), the simple equality between admission proportion and prevalence breaks down. For example, if psychosis leads to a much longer institutionalization ($D_{psy} > D_{avg}$), individuals with psychosis will accumulate in the asylum, causing the true point prevalence ($P_{psy}$) to be significantly higher than the fraction of admissions with psychosis ($f_{psy}$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.4000}\n$$", "id": "4772469"}, {"introduction": "Quantitative analysis can move beyond narrative descriptions to test specific hypotheses about practices within the asylum, such as the application of mechanical restraint. This exercise introduces the odds ratio, a powerful statistical tool for measuring the association between a patient characteristic (like sex) and a clinical outcome (like being restrained).

An odds ratio of $1$ would indicate that the odds of restraint are identical for men and women. An odds ratio greater than $1$ indicates that the odds of the outcome (restraint) are higher in the numerator group (men). An odds ratio less than $1$ would indicate lower odds in the numerator group.\n\nOur calculated odds ratio is approximately $2.136$, which is significantly greater than $1$. This indicates that the odds of a male patient being placed in mechanical restraint are about $2.136$ times the odds for a female patient. Since the analysis is based on cohorts matched for observed symptom severity, this finding is consistent with a potential systemic bias in clinical practice, where male patients were subjected to mechanical restraint more frequently than female patients with comparable observed characteristics.

This will be achieved by calculating a case-mix–adjusted risk ratio using the method of direct standardization.\n\nFirst, we define and organize the provided data. Let $D$ represent the number of discharges (the population at risk) and $R$ represent the number of readmissions (the events). The subscripts 'pub' and 'priv' will denote public asylums and private hospitals, respectively. The subscripts 'sev' and 'mild' will denote the case severity strata.\n\nThe provided data are:\n- Public asylums, severe cases: $D_{pub, sev} = 600$, $R_{pub, sev} = 180$.\n- Public asylums, mild cases: $D_{pub, mild} = 200$, $R_{pub, mild} = 20$.\n- Private hospitals, severe cases: $D_{priv, sev} = 150$, $R_{priv, sev} = 45$.\n- Private hospitals, mild cases: $D_{priv, mild} = 450$, $R_{priv, mild} = 45$.\n\nThe risk, $r$, is defined as $r = \\frac{\\text{events}}{\\text{population at risk}}$.\n\n**Task 1: Verify the crude (unadjusted) readmission risk.**\n\nThe crude risk for each institution type is the total number of readmissions divided by the total number of discharges, across both strata.\n\nFor public asylums:\nTotal discharges: $D_{pub} = D_{pub, sev} + D_{pub, mild} = 600 + 200 = 800$.\nTotal readmissions: $R_{pub} = R_{pub, sev} + R_{pub, mild} = 180 + 20 = 200$.\nCrude readmission risk for public asylums:\n$$r_{pub, crude} = \\frac{R_{pub}}{D_{pub}} = \\frac{200}{800} = 0.25$$\n\nFor private hospitals:\nTotal discharges: $D_{priv} = D_{priv, sev} + D_{priv, mild} = 150 + 450 = 600$.\nTotal readmissions: $R_{priv} = R_{priv, sev} + R_{priv, mild} = 45 + 45 = 90$.\nCrude readmission risk for private hospitals:\n$$r_{priv, crude} = \\frac{R_{priv}}{D_{priv}} = \\frac{90}{600} = \\frac{9}{60} = \\frac{3}{20} = 0.15$$\n\nThe crude analysis shows that the readmission risk at public asylums ($25\\%$) is substantially higher than at private hospitals ($15\\%$).\n\nA plausible historical explanation for this crude difference is selection bias, specifically a form of confounding known as confounding by indication. Public asylums typically served patients who were more severely and chronically ill, often by state mandate or due to an inability to afford private care. Private hospitals catered to a clientele that could afford treatment, which may have included earlier intervention for milder forms of illness. This differential admission practice creates a systematic difference in the case mix between the two types of institutions. We can verify this by examining the proportion of severe cases in each:\n- Proportion of severe cases in public asylums: $\\frac{D_{pub, sev}}{D_{pub}} = \\frac{600}{800} = 0.75$ or $75\\%$.\n- Proportion of severe cases in private hospitals: $\\frac{D_{priv, sev}}{D_{priv}} = \\frac{150}{600} = 0.25$ or $25\\%$.\nThe data confirm that public asylums have a much heavier burden of severe cases. Since severe cases inherently have a higher risk of readmission, this difference in case mix (a confounding variable) likely inflates the crude risk of public asylums, obscuring the true performance of the institutions.\n\n**Task 2: Compute the directly standardized readmission risk.**\n\nTo adjust for the confounding effect of case mix, we first calculate the stratum-specific risks for each institution.\n\nStratum-specific risks for public asylums:\n- Severe cases: $r_{pub, sev} = \\frac{R_{pub, sev}}{D_{pub, sev}} = \\frac{180}{600} = 0.30$.\n- Mild cases: $r_{pub, mild} = \\frac{R_{pub, mild}}{D_{pub, mild}} = \\frac{20}{200} = 0.10$.\n\nStratum-specific risks for private hospitals:\n- Severe cases: $r_{priv, sev} = \\frac{R_{priv, sev}}{D_{priv, sev}} = \\frac{45}{150} = 0.30$.\n- Mild cases: $r_{priv, mild} = \\frac{R_{priv, mild}}{D_{priv, mild}} = \\frac{45}{450} = 0.10$.\n\nRemarkably, the stratum-specific risks are identical for both institution types. Within the severe-case stratum, the risk is $0.30$ for both public and private institutions. Within the mild-case stratum, the risk is $0.10$ for both. This phenomenon, where an association observed in the aggregate data reverses or disappears when the data are stratified, is known as Simpson's Paradox.\n\nNext, we establish the standard population using the combined cohort, as specified.\n- Total severe cases in standard population: $D_{std, sev} = D_{pub, sev} + D_{priv, sev} = 600 + 150 = 750$.\n- Total mild cases in standard population: $D_{std, mild} = D_{pub, mild} + D_{priv, mild} = 200 + 450 = 650$.\n- Total discharges in standard population: $D_{std, total} = D_{std, sev} + D_{std, mild} = 750 + 650 = 1400$.\n\nThe weights for direct standardization are the proportions of each stratum in this standard population:\n- Weight for severe stratum: $w_{sev} = \\frac{D_{std, sev}}{D_{std, total}} = \\frac{750}{1400} = \\frac{15}{28}$.\n- Weight for mild stratum: $w_{mild} = \\frac{D_{std, mild}}{D_{std, total}} = \\frac{650}{1400} = \\frac{13}{28}$.\n\nNow, we compute the directly standardized risk (DSR) for each institution type by applying these weights to their stratum-specific risks. The formula for DSR is $r_{std} = \\sum_{i} w_i r_i$.\n\nDirectly standardized risk for public asylums ($r_{pub, std}$):\n$$r_{pub, std} = (w_{sev} \\times r_{pub, sev}) + (w_{mild} \\times r_{pub, mild})$$\n$$r_{pub, std} = \\left(\\frac{15}{28} \\times 0.30\\right) + \\left(\\frac{13}{28} \\times 0.10\\right) = \\frac{15 \\times 0.30 + 13 \\times 0.10}{28} = \\frac{4.5 + 1.3}{28} = \\frac{5.8}{28} = \\frac{58}{280} = \\frac{29}{140}$$\n\nDirectly standardized risk for private hospitals ($r_{priv, std}$):\n$$r_{priv, std} = (w_{sev} \\times r_{priv, sev}) + (w_{mild} \\times r_{priv, mild})$$\n$$r_{priv, std} = \\left(\\frac{15}{28} \\times 0.30\\right) + \\left(\\frac{13}{28} \\times 0.10\\right) = \\frac{4.5 + 1.3}{28} = \\frac{5.8}{28} = \\frac{29}{140}$$\n\nAfter adjusting for the case mix, the standardized risks for both public and private institutions are identical, equal to $\\frac{29}{140} \\approx 0.20714$.\n\n**Task 3: Compute the case-mix–adjusted risk ratio.**\n\nThe adjusted risk ratio ($RR_{adj}$) is the ratio of the standardized risks.\n$$RR_{adj} = \\frac{r_{pub, std}}{r_{priv, std}} = \\frac{29/140}{29/140} = 1$$\n\nThe exact adjusted risk ratio is $1$. The problem requests the answer rounded to four significant figures. This gives $1.000$. This result demonstrates that after accounting for the disproportionate burden of severe cases in public asylums, there is no evidence of a difference in readmission risk between the two types of institutions.
