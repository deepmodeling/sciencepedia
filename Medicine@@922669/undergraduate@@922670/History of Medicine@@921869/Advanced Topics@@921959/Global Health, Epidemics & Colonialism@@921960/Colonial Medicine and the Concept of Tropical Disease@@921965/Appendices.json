Colonial physicians claim a doctrine of “racial susceptibility,” arguing that “Africans are more susceptible to tropical diseases than Europeans.” You are asked to translate this claim into a testable epidemiological hypothesis, specify admissible evidentiary standards for evaluating it, and interpret comparative data. Use the following contextual facts as the fundamental base: under Germ Theory, malaria is caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes; risk increases with mosquito exposure and ecological conditions that favor vector breeding. From introductory epidemiology, incidence is the proportion of new cases over a defined population and period, and causal claims require appropriate control of confounding and assessment of independence conditional on relevant covariates.\n\nDefine variables: $R \\in \\{\\text{European}, \\text{African}\\}$ denotes socially classified race, $E \\in \\{\\text{coastal\\ swamp}, \\text{highland}\\}$ denotes environment, $X \\in \\{\\text{high}, \\text{low}\\}$ denotes mosquito exposure (e.g., proximity to marshes and use of bed nets), and $D \\in \\{0,1\\}$ denotes malaria occurrence in the observation window.

It presents a historically plausible scenario requiring the application of modern epidemiological principles to evaluate a claim of racial susceptibility to disease. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and definitions to perform a quantitative analysis of confounding, a core concept in epidemiology. It is scientifically grounded in germ theory and the principles of causal inference, and is framed objectively as a test of a hypothesis.\n\nThe central task is to translate the claim \"Africans are more susceptible to tropical diseases than Europeans\" into a testable hypothesis and evaluate it using the provided data. The claim implies that race ($R$) is a causal factor for malaria ($D$). However, modern epidemiological practice, as alluded to in the problem statement, requires controlling for potential confounding variables. Here, environment ($E$) and mosquito exposure ($X$) are identified as such confounders, as they are known risk factors for malaria and may be associated with the variable of interest, race ($R$).\n\nThe analytical method to address this is stratification. We will compare the incidence of malaria between Europeans and Africans both overall (the crude association) and within specific strata defined by the confounding variables $(E, X)$.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the crude (pooled) risk for each racial group, ignoring the strata.\n\n-   Total population of Europeans: $200 + 400 = 600$.\n-   Total malaria cases among Europeans: $60 + 8 = 68$.\n-   Crude risk for Europeans: $P(D=1 \\mid R=\\text{European}) = \\frac{68}{600} \\approx 0.113$.\n\n-   Total population of Africans: $400 + 200 = 600$.\n-   Total malaria cases among Africans: $120 + 4 = 124$.\n-   Crude risk for Africans: $P(D=1 \\mid R=\\text{African}) = \\frac{124}{600} \\approx 0.207$.\n\nThe crude risk for Africans is nearly double that for Europeans ($0.207$ vs. $0.113$). An analysis that fails to account for confounding would erroneously conclude that race is a causal factor.\n\nNow, let's perform a stratified analysis by calculating the risk within each stratum defined by $(E, X)$.\n\n**Stratum 1: High exposure ($X=\\text{high}$ is denoted by $X=1$ in the problem's data for calculation convenience), coastal swamp ($E=\\text{coastal swamp}$)**\n-   Risk for Europeans: $P(D=1 \\mid R=\\text{European}, X=1, E=\\text{coastal swamp}) = \\frac{60}{200} = 0.30$.\n-   Risk for Africans: $P(D=1 \\mid R=\\text{African}, X=1, E=\\text{coastal swamp}) = \\frac{120}{400} = 0.30$.\n\nWithin this high-risk stratum, the risk of malaria is identical for both Europeans and Africans. The risk ratio is $\\frac{0.30}{0.30} = 1.0$.\n\n**Stratum 2: Low exposure ($X=\\text{low}$ is denoted by $X=0$), highland ($E=\\text{highland}$)**\n-   Risk for Europeans: $P(D=1 \\mid R=\\text{European}, X=0, E=\\text{highland}) = \\frac{8}{400} = 0.02$.\n-   Risk for Africans: $P(D=1 \\mid R=\\text{African}, X=0, E=\\text{highland}) = \\frac{4}{200} = 0.02$.\n\nWithin this low-risk stratum, the risk of malaria is also identical for both groups. The risk ratio is $\\frac{0.02}{0.02} = 1.0$.\n\nThe stratified analysis reveals that once environment and exposure are held constant, the association between race and malaria risk disappears completely. This is a classic example of confounding, sometimes leading to Simpson's Paradox. The crude association is spurious and is entirely explained by the fact that the racial groups are distributed unevenly across the exposure strata. A much higher proportion of the African population in this dataset is in the high-risk stratum ($400/600 = 66.7\\%$) compared to the European population ($200/600 = 33.3\\%$). Conversely, a higher proportion of Europeans are in the low-risk stratum. The independent causal variables are clearly environment and exposure, with the risk being $15$ times higher in the coastal swamp/high exposure stratum ($0.30$) compared to the highland/low exposure stratum ($0.02$), regardless of race.\n\nA scientifically sound approach must formalize the hypothesis test in terms of conditional independence and use the stratified analysis to make a conclusion.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n\n**A. State $H_1: P(D=1\\mid R=\\text{African}) > P(D=1\\mid R=\\text{European})$ using crude risks pooled over all environments and exposures. Consider simple correlation sufficient evidence. Conclude that because the pooled African incidence exceeds the pooled European incidence, race is causal.**\nThis option describes an analysis that is explicitly forbidden by the principles of causal inference mentioned in the problem statement (\"causal claims require appropriate control of confounding\"). It correctly computes the crude risks but then uses a flawed evidentiary standard (\"simple correlation sufficient evidence\") to draw an incorrect causal conclusion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. State $H_0: P(D=1\\mid R=r,E=e,X=x) = P(D=1\\mid E=e,X=x)$ for all $r,e,x$, versus $H_1$: there exists $e,x$ such that $P(D=1\\mid R=\\text{African},E=e,X=x) \\neq P(D=1\\mid R=\\text{European},E=e,X=x)$. Adopt evidentiary standards requiring exchangeability within strata, uniform case definitions, temporal precedence of $(E,X)$ before $D$, and replication of effects across strata. Compute stratum-specific risks and risk ratios; because within both $(E,X)$ strata the risks are equal across $R$, accept $H_0$ and attribute causality to $(E,X)$ given the large difference in risk between $X=1$ and $X=0$.**\nThis option presents a methodologically perfect approach.\n-   **Hypothesis Formulation**: It correctly formulates the null hypothesis ($H_0$) as the conditional independence of disease ($D$) and race ($R$) given the confounders ($E, X$). The alternative hypothesis ($H_1$) is the existence of a stratum where race does make a difference.\n-   **Evidentiary Standards**: It lists appropriate and rigorous standards for causal inference.\n-   **Analysis**: It prescribes computing stratum-specific risks, which is the correct procedure.\n-   **Conclusion**: It correctly interprets the results of the stratified analysis—that the risks are equal within strata—to accept the null hypothesis ($H_0$) and correctly identifies $(E,X)$ as the causal factors, noting the large effect size (risk difference between strata).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. State $H_1$: race is an innate biological cause; operationalize $R$ by skin color scale. Accept historical racial typologies as admissible evidence. Conclude that any observed difference in hospital records suffices to verify racial susceptibility regardless of environment or exposure.**\nThis option describes the unscientific, pseudoscientific approach of the $1905$ colonial physicians, not a valid epidemiological analysis. It uses non-scientific evidentiary standards (\"historical racial typologies\") and explicitly rejects the principle of controlling for confounding. This fails the task of translating the claim into a *testable* (by modern standards) hypothesis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. State $H_1$: race affects disease risk through behavior and living arrangements; therefore do not adjust for $X$ or $E$ to avoid “overadjustment.” Use hospital admissions alone to infer causality. Conclude that the higher crude incidence among Africans indicates a real racial effect even if differences disappear after stratification by exposure and environment.**\nThis option misapplies the concept of \"overadjustment.\" Adjustment for a variable is inappropriate if it is a mediator on the causal pathway between the exposure and outcome. However, the original claim is about innate \"racial susceptibility,\" which implies a direct biological link. To test for such a link, one *must* control for environmental and behavioral factors ($E, X$) to see if any residual effect of race ($R$) remains. This option incorrectly argues against this control. Furthermore, concluding that a crude effect is \"real\" even when it disappears upon stratification is a misinterpretation of confounding. The disappearance of the effect is the crucial evidence that the effect was not due to race in the first place.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4741646"}, {"introduction": "Beyond ideology and data collection, it is crucial to understand the motivations driving colonial health interventions. This practice challenges you to think critically about the very structure of colonial data collection.

District X has a population of $100{,}000$, with approximately $80\\%$ of inhabitants living within $5$ $\\mathrm{km}$ of a government or mission clinic. Over a $12$-month period, clinics in District X recorded $4{,}000$ new malaria cases and $40$ deaths among those recorded malaria cases.

Over the same $12$-month period, clinics in District Y recorded $1{,}500$ new malaria cases and $60$ deaths among those recorded malaria cases.\n\nAt the end of the rainy season, the administration conducted a standardized cross-sectional microscopy survey in each district, sampling $2{,}000$ individuals per district using the same protocol and timing. In District X, $120$ individuals had parasitemia ($6\\%$), and in District Y, $140$ individuals had parasitemia ($7\\%$).

Incidence is the occurrence of new cases in a defined population over a specified time; prevalence is the proportion of the population with disease at a given point in time; the case fatality rate (CFR) is the proportion of identified cases who die from the disease. With uneven clinic access, facility-based incidence will disproportionately undercount cases where access is lower, and facility-based CFR will be upwardly biased where only severe cases reach clinics. Therefore, a standardized cross-sectional prevalence survey conducted with the same methods and timing across districts provides the more appropriate basis for burden comparison.\n\nB. Prevalence is the count of new cases over a period; incidence is the count of all existing cases at a point in time; CFR is deaths among the total population. Because deaths are recorded precisely, facility-based CFR is the least biased comparator across districts, regardless of access differences.\n\nC. Incidence is new cases over time; prevalence is existing cases at a point; CFR is deaths among cases. CFR is least sensitive to under-ascertainment because death certificates are filed even in remote areas, so the higher CFR in District Y indicates greater pathogen virulence there, making CFR the best comparator.\n\nD. Incidence is the proportion of the population that becomes newly ill during a period; prevalence is the proportion ill at a point; CFR is deaths among cases. Even if clinic access differs, reported annual incidence can be compared directly across districts when scaled by population denominators, because the denominator adjustment corrects for surveillance differences.\n\nE. Incidence is new cases over time; prevalence is the proportion who will develop disease over the coming year; CFR is deaths among cases. Because prevalence is affected by seasonality, only the annual facility case tallies (reported incidence) are valid for cross-district comparison under colonial conditions, not cross-sectional surveys, which are inherently non-comparable.", "solution": "The user has requested a critical validation of a problem statement, followed by a solution and evaluation of options, adhering to strict formatting and a specific academic persona.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\nThe problem provides the following data and conditions:\n\n**District X:**\n*   Population: $100,000$\n*   Clinic Access: $80\\%$ of inhabitants live within $5$ $\\mathrm{km}$ of a clinic.\n*   Recorded New Malaria Cases (12 months): $4,000$\n*   Recorded Deaths among Malaria Cases: $40$\n\n**District Y:**\n*   Population: $100,000$\n*   Clinic Access: $30\\%$ of inhabitants live within $5$ $\\mathrm{km}$ of a clinic.\n*   Recorded New Malaria Cases (12 months): $1,500$\n*   Recorded Deaths among Malaria Cases: $60$\n\n**Cross-Sectional Survey:**\n*   Timing: End of the rainy season, same protocol and timing in both districts.\n*   Sample Size: $2,000$ individuals per district.\n*   Survey finding in District X: $120$ individuals with parasitemia.\n*   Survey finding in District Y: $140$ individuals with parasitemia.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n*   Microscopy sensitivity is comparable across districts.\n*   The survey samples are representative of their respective district populations.\n\n**Question:**\nThe task is to identify the option that both (i) correctly defines incidence, prevalence, and the case fatality rate (CFR), and (ii) correctly identifies the most appropriate measure and data source for comparing malaria burden across the two districts, providing a historically realistic justification.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly grounded in fundamental principles of epidemiology.

There are no contradictions, missing information, or violations of scientific principles. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of this problem lies in understanding three key epidemiological measures and recognizing the profound impact of surveillance methodology on the data generated.\n\n**Part 1: Formal Definitions**\n\nFirst, let us establish the correct definitions for the epidemiological terms in question.\n*   **Incidence:** Measures the occurrence of new cases of a disease in a specified population during a defined period. The incidence proportion (also known as risk or cumulative incidence) is calculated as:\n    $$ \\text{Incidence Proportion} = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases during a period}}{\\text{Population at risk at the start of the period}} $$\n*   **Prevalence:** Measures the proportion of a population that has a disease at a specific point in time (point prevalence) or over a period of time (period prevalence). The survey described in the problem measures point prevalence.\n    $$ \\text{Point Prevalence} = \\frac{\\text{Number of existing cases at a single point in time}}{\\text{Total population at that point in time}} $$\n*   **Case Fatality Rate (CFR):** Measures the proportion of individuals with a diagnosed disease who die from that disease within a specified time. It is a measure of disease severity.\n    $$ \\text{CFR} = \\frac{\\text{Number of deaths from a disease}}{\\text{Number of diagnosed cases of that disease}} \\times 100\\% $$\n\n**Part 2: Analysis of Provided Data**\n\nLet us calculate these measures from the two available data sources: facility-based records and the cross-sectional survey.\n\n**From Facility-Based Data (Passive Surveillance):**\n\nFor District X:\n*   Reported Annual Incidence Proportion = $\\frac{4,000}{100,000} = 0.04$ or $4.0\\%$\n*   Reported CFR = $\\frac{40}{4,000} = 0.01$ or $1.0\\%$\n\nFor District Y:\n*   Reported Annual Incidence Proportion = $\\frac{1,500}{100,000} = 0.015$ or $1.5\\%$\n*   Reported CFR = $\\frac{60}{1,500} = 0.04$ or $4.0\\%$\n\nA naive interpretation of this data would suggest that District X has a much higher malaria incidence but a much lower case fatality rate than District Y.\n\n**From Cross-Sectional Survey Data (Active Surveillance):**\n\nFor District X:\n*   Point Prevalence of Parasitemia = $\\frac{120}{2,000} = 0.06$ or $6.0\\%$\n\nFor District Y:\n*   Point Prevalence of Parasitemia = $\\frac{140}{2,000} = 0.07$ or $7.0\\%$\n\nThis survey data suggests that the underlying burden of malaria infection (prevalence) is actually slightly higher in District Y than in District X.\n\n**Part 3: Reconciliation and Interpretation**\n\nThe discrepancy between the two data sources must be explained by surveillance artifacts.\n\n*   **Bias in Incidence Data:** District X has far superior clinic access ($80\\%$) compared to District Y ($30\\%$). Therefore, an individual with malaria in District X is much more likely to be diagnosed and recorded than a similar individual in District Y. The higher reported incidence in District X is almost certainly a reflection of better case ascertainment (i.e., better surveillance coverage), not necessarily a higher true incidence. Comparing these facility-based incidence figures is misleading as it confounds true disease occurrence with the probability of being recorded.\n*   **Bias in CFR Data:** The CFR in District Y ($4.0\\%$) is four times higher than in District X ($1.0\\%$). While this could reflect differences in pathogen virulence or host immunity, a more parsimonious explanation rooted in the data is severity bias. In District Y, where access to care is poor, it is plausible that only the most severely ill patients undertake the difficult journey to a clinic. Milder cases are managed at home and never enter the official record. The facility data in District Y is thus enriched with severe cases, which have a higher intrinsic risk of death, artificially inflating the CFR. Conversely, the better access in District X means a broader spectrum of disease severity, including many mild cases, is captured, resulting in a lower, and likely more representative, CFR.\n*   **Validity of Survey Data:** The cross-sectional survey was standardized—conducted with the same protocol, timing, and sampling method in both districts. By actively seeking out cases in a representative sample of the population, this method bypasses the biases inherent in a passive system that relies on patients self-presenting to clinics. The similar prevalence rates ($6.0\\%$ in X vs. $7.0\\%$ in Y) provide a much more reliable and comparable estimate of the true underlying malaria burden in the two districts.\n\n**Conclusion:** The standardized cross-sectional survey is the most appropriate data source for comparing malaria burden. Facility-based incidence is distorted by ascertainment bias, and facility-based CFR is distorted by severity bias, both stemming from the documented difference in clinic access.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**Option A:**\n*   **Definitions:** \"Incidence is the occurrence of new cases in a defined population over a specified time; prevalence is the proportion of the population with disease at a given point in time; the case fatality rate (CFR) is the proportion of identified cases who die from the disease.\" These definitions are correct.\n*   **Reasoning:** The reasoning correctly identifies that uneven clinic access leads to undercounting of cases (ascertainment bias) where access is lower (District Y) and an upward bias in CFR where only severe cases are seen (also District Y). It correctly concludes that the standardized cross-sectional prevalence survey is the more appropriate basis for comparison. This aligns perfectly with our derivation.\n*   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**Option B:**\n*   **Definitions:** \"Prevalence is the count of new cases over a period; incidence is the count of all existing cases at a point in time; CFR is deaths among the total population.\" These definitions are fundamentally incorrect. It swaps incidence and prevalence and incorrectly defines CFR. The total deaths in a population constitute the mortality rate, not the CFR.\n*   **Reasoning:** The reasoning is built on faulty definitions and the historically unsound premise that death records would be precise and unbiased in this context.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C:**\n*   **Definitions:** \"Incidence is new cases over time; prevalence is existing cases at a point; CFR is deaths among cases.\" These are colloquially acceptable, abbreviated definitions.\n*   **Reasoning:** The reasoning asserts that CFR is least sensitive to under-ascertainment because of comprehensive death certificate filing. This is a highly suspect assumption for a rural colonial setting in $1908$. More importantly, it fails to consider the strong likelihood of severity bias in the numerator (deaths) and denominator (cases) of the facility-based CFR calculation. It jumps to a conclusion about \"pathogen virulence\" while ignoring the most obvious structural bias presented in the problem.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D:**\n*   **Definitions:** \"Incidence is the proportion of the population that becomes newly ill during a period; prevalence is the proportion ill at a point; CFR is deaths among cases.\" These definitions are correct.\n*   **Reasoning:** The reasoning contains a critical flaw: \"...the denominator adjustment corrects for surveillance differences.\" This is false. Dividing the number of cases (the numerator) by the total population (the denominator) calculates a rate but does nothing to correct for bias in how the numerator itself was ascertained. The fundamental problem is that the count of new cases is incomplete and differentially so between the districts.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option E:**\n*   **Definitions:** \"prevalence is the proportion who will develop disease over the coming year\". This is an incorrect definition of prevalence; it describes incidence proportion (risk).\n*   **Reasoning:** The reasoning is flawed. It correctly notes that prevalence can be affected by seasonality but ignores that the survey was explicitly timed the same way in both districts to control for this. It then makes the erroneous claim that facility data is *more* valid and that cross-sectional surveys are \"inherently non-comparable,\" which is the opposite of established epidemiological practice. Standardized surveys are precisely the tool used to make valid comparisons.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4741662"}, {"introduction": "Beyond ideology and data collection, it is crucial to understand the motivations driving colonial health interventions.

The manager’s rationale relies on first principles: malaria reduces effective labor time through febrile illness and convalescence; output at the margin is approximately proportional to effective worker-days; vector control and chemoprophylaxis reduce infection risk; and, if their effects are independent, relative risk reductions combine multiplicatively. You are asked to formalize this cost-benefit argument and test a key assumption about labor-days lost using clinic records.\n\nAssume the following scientifically grounded base:\n- Malaria transmission involves Anopheles mosquitoes, so bed nets and drainage reduce exposure, and chemoprophylaxis reduces the probability that an infectious bite leads to clinical disease.\n- For small changes around current practice, output is approximately linear in effective labor-days, so the marginal value of a recovered worker-day can be treated as constant over the relevant range.\n\nData for the plantation:\n- Number of workers: $N = 800$.\n- Baseline malaria incidence: $I_b = 1.2$ infections per worker per year.\n- Mean days of fever and convalescence per infection (absent from field work): $d = 4$ days.\n- Clinic-logged malaria-attributed absenteeism at baseline: $A_m = 4.2$ days per worker per year.\n- Working days per worker per year are sufficiently large that marginal changes do not alter the proportionality assumption.\n- Value added per effective worker-day: $v = 0.7$ pounds per day.\n- Plantation area: $H = 600$ hectares.\n\nInterventions and their characteristics:\n- Quinine chemoprophylaxis: relative reduction in clinical malaria $r_q = 0.40$; cost $C_q = 0.1$ pounds per worker per month.\n- Insecticide-treated bed nets: relative reduction $r_n = 0.25$; purchase cost per worker $C_n = 0.9$ pounds; usable life $L_n = 3$ years (use straight-line annualization).\n- Drainage and oiling of breeding sites: relative reduction $r_d = 0.30$; annual cost per hectare $C_d$ (unknown).\n\nAssumptions to be tested against data:\n1.

We must find the maximum drainage cost per hectare per year, $C_d^{\\ast}$, that satisfies this condition.\n\nThe break-even equation is:\n$$\n\\text{Annual Value of Recovered Labor} = \\text{Total Annual Cost of Interventions}\n$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the annual benefit. The benefit is the economic value of the worker-days recovered due to the reduction in malaria.\n\nThe problem requires us to test the assumption about baseline malaria-lost days. The naïve theoretical prediction for lost days per worker per year is the product of the baseline incidence and the days lost per infection:\n$$\nL_{\\text{theoretical}} = I_b \\times d = 1.2 \\, \\text{yr}^{-1} \\times 4 \\, \\text{days} = 4.8 \\, \\text{days/worker/year}\n$$\nThe clinic-logged absenteeism is $A_m = 4.2$ days per worker per year. According to the problem's explicit instruction (Assumption 2), since $L_{\\text{theoretical}} > A_m$, we must use the empirically observed value $A_m$ as the baseline for malaria-lost days. Let this baseline be $L_b$.\n$$\nL_b = A_m = 4.2 \\, \\text{days/worker/year}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the proportional reduction in malaria incidence, $\\rho$, resulting from the combined interventions. The interventions are quinine chemoprophylaxis ($r_q = 0.40$), insecticide-treated bed nets ($r_n = 0.25$), and drainage ($r_d = 0.30$). Assuming their effects are independent, the remaining fraction of incidence, $\\theta$, is the product of the individual remaining fractions:\n$$\n\\theta = (1 - r_q)(1 - r_n)(1 - r_d) = (1 - 0.40)(1 - 0.25)(1 - 0.30)\n$$\n$$\n\\theta = (0.60)(0.75)(0.70) = 0.45 \\times 0.70 = 0.315\n$$\nThe proportional reduction in incidence is therefore:\n$$\n\\rho = 1 - \\theta = 1 - 0.315 = 0.685\n$$\nThis means the interventions are expected to prevent $68.5\\%$ of the malaria cases that would otherwise occur.\n\nThe number of worker-days recovered per worker per year is the proportional reduction applied to the baseline of lost days:\n$$\nD_{\\text{rec, worker}} = L_b \\times \\rho = 4.2 \\times 0.685\n$$\nThe total number of recovered worker-days for the entire plantation of $N=800$ workers is:\n$$\nD_{\\text{rec, total}} = N \\times D_{\\text{rec, worker}} = 800 \\times 4.2 \\times 0.685\n$$\nThe total annual value of this recovered labor, which constitutes the benefit of the program, is:\n$$\nV_{\\text{benefit}} = D_{\\text{rec, total}} \\times v = (800 \\times 4.2 \\times 0.685) \\times 0.7\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\text{benefit}} = 800 \\times (4.2 \\times 0.685 \\times 0.7) = 800 \\times 2.0139 = 1611.12 \\, \\text{pounds/year}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total annual cost of the interventions, $C_{\\text{total}}$. This cost has three components: quinine, bed nets, and drainage.\n1.  **Annual cost of quinine ($C_{\\text{Q}}$)**: The cost is $C_q = 0.1$ pounds per worker per month. For $N=800$ workers over $12$ months, the total annual cost is:\n    $$\n    C_{\\text{Q}} = N \\times C_q \\times 12 = 800 \\times 0.1 \\times 12 = 960 \\, \\text{pounds/year}\n    $$\n2.  **Annual cost of bed nets ($C_{\\text{N}}$)**: The purchase cost is $C_n = 0.9$ pounds per worker, and the nets have a usable life of $L_n = 3$ years. Using straight-line annualization, the annual cost per worker is $C_n/L_n$. For $N=800$ workers, the total annual cost is:\n    $$\n    C_{\\text{N}} = N \\times \\frac{C_n}{L_n} = 800 \\times \\frac{0.9}{3} = 800 \\times 0.3 = 240 \\, \\text{pounds/year}\n    $$\n3.  **Annual cost of drainage ($C_{\\text{D}}$)**: The cost is $C_d$ pounds per hectare per year. For a plantation of area $H=600$ hectares, the total annual cost is:\n    $$\n    C_{\\text{D}} = H \\times C_d = 600 \\times C_d\n    $$\nThe total annual cost is the sum of these components:\n$$\nC_{\\text{total}} = C_{\\text{Q}} + C_{\\text{N}} + C_{\\text{D}} = 960 + 240 + 600 C_d = 1200 + 600 C_d\n$$\n\nNow, we apply the break-even condition, setting the total annual benefit equal to the total annual cost. We solve for the break-even drainage cost, $C_d^{\\ast}$.\n$$\nV_{\\text{benefit}} = C_{\\text{total}}\n$$\n$$\n1611.12 = 1200 + 600 C_d^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\n600 C_d^{\\ast} = 1611.12 - 1200\n$$\n$$\n600 C_d^{\\ast} = 411.12\n$$\n$$\nC_d^{\\ast} = \\frac{411.12}{600} = 0.6852\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nC_d^{\\ast} \\approx 0.685\n$$\nThe maximum annual cost for drainage that allows the program to break even is $0.685$ pounds per hectare.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.685}\n$$", "id": "4741690"}]}
