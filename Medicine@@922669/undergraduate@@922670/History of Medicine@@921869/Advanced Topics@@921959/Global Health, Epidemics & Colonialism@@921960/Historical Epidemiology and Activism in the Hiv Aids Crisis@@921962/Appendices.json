During the HIV/AIDS crisis, the surveillance case definition for AIDS evolved, partly due to pressure from activists who argued the initial definition was too narrow and excluded many affected communities. This exercise places you in the role of a public health official to see how a pivotal change in this definition reclassified patients. By applying two different historical definitions to a set of hypothetical cases and measuring their statistical agreement, you will gain a hands-on understanding of how surveillance definitions impact who is counted and how we perceive the scope of an epidemic [@problem_id:4748370].", "problem": "A health historian studying the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) crisis seeks to quantify how changes in surveillance case definitions affected classification of illness during the late 1980s and early 1990s, a period shaped by activism such as the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) campaigns. Using well-tested epidemiological practice, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance case definitions specified what counts as an AIDS case for public health reporting.

These are the diagonal elements of the contingency table.\n$$ p_o = \\frac{\\text{Number of agreements}}{N} = \\frac{6 + 3}{12} = \\frac{9}{12} = 0.75 $$\n\nThe expected proportion of agreement by chance, $p_e$, is the sum of the products of the marginal probabilities for each category.\nLet $P_{A_{1987}}$ and $P_{N_{1987}}$ be the marginal proportions for the 1987 classification, and $P_{A_{1993}}$ and $P_{N_{1993}}$ for the 1993 classification.\nFrom the contingency table row and column totals:\n- $P_{A_{1987}} = \\frac{\\text{Row Total for AIDS}}{N} = \\frac{6}{12} = 0.5$\n- $P_{N_{1987}} = \\frac{\\text{Row Total for Not AIDS}}{N} = \\frac{6}{12} = 0.5$\n- $P_{A_{1993}} = \\frac{\\text{Column Total for AIDS}}{N} = \\frac{9}{12} = 0.75$\n- $P_{N_{1993}} = \\frac{\\text{Column Total for Not AIDS}}{N} = \\frac{3}{12} = 0.25$\n\nThe expected proportion of agreement on 'AIDS' by chance is $P_{A_{1987}} \\times P_{A_{1993}}$.\nThe expected proportion of agreement on 'Not AIDS' by chance is $P_{N_{1987}} \\times P_{N_{1993}}$.\nThus, the total expected proportion of agreement is:\n$$ p_e = (P_{A_{1987}} \\times P_{A_{1993}}) + (P_{N_{1987}} \\times P_{N_{1993}}) $$\n$$ p_e = (0.5 \\times 0.75) + (0.5 \\times 0.25) = 0.375 + 0.125 = 0.5 $$\n\nNow, we can calculate $\\kappa$:\n$$ \\kappa = \\frac{p_o - p_e}{1 - p_e} = \\frac{0.75 - 0.5}{1 - 0.5} = \\frac{0.25}{0.5} = 0.5 $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The exact value is $0.5$. Expressed with three significant figures, this is $0.500$.\nThis value represents moderate agreement between the two classification systems.

Derive an expression for the expected AIDS incidence $A(t)$ in terms of $I_{H}(t)$ and $g(s)$ by integrating over all possible incubation times.\n2. Derive an expression for the expected observed, reported AIDS incidence $O(t)$ in terms of $A(t)$ and $h(u)$ by integrating over all possible reporting delays.\n\nAssume that during an early phase of the epidemic, the HIV incidence grows exponentially as $I_{H}(t) = I_{0}\\exp(r t)$ with growth rate $r0$ and amplitude $I_{0}0$. Assume that $S$ follows a gamma distribution with shape $k0$ and scale $\\theta0$, so that $g(s) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(k)\\theta^{k}} s^{k-1} \\exp(-s/\\theta)$ for $s0$, and that $U$ follows an exponential distribution with mean $\\delta0$, so that $h(u) = \\frac{1}{\\delta}\\exp(-u/\\delta)$ for $u0$.\n\nUsing only these assumptions and standard integral calculus, show that $A(t)$ and $O(t)$ each inherit the exponential growth rate $r$ and identify the multiplicative level factors in closed form. Now consider the historically plausible scenario in which activism by the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) successfully pressures public health authorities to accelerate case reporting by reducing the mean reporting delay from $\\delta_{\\text{pre}}$ to $\\delta_{\\text{post}}$ at a specific calendar time, without changing $I_{H}(t)$ or $g(s)$. A naive analyst who ignores reporting delays would interpret the observed reported AIDS series $O(t)$ as a direct proxy for $A(t)$; quantify the instantaneous multiplicative jump in $O(t)$ across that change which would be mistakenly attributed to a change in epidemic trend.\n\nTake $r = 0.25$ per year, $\\delta_{\\text{pre}} = 2$ years, and $\\delta_{\\text{post}} = 0.5$ years. Compute the multiplicative jump as a single number. Give your final answer as an exact fraction (dimensionless).", "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It presents a standard problem in mathematical epidemiology that is based on established principles and is historically motivated. The assumptions and provided data are consistent and sufficient for deriving a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe problem asks for several derivations and a final calculation based on the principles of population dynamics and probability theory.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Expected AIDS Incidence, $A(t)$**\n\nThe expected AIDS incidence at time $t$, denoted $A(t)$, is the rate at which individuals are diagnosed with AIDS. An individual diagnosed at time $t$ must have been infected with HIV at some earlier time $t-s$, where $s$ is the incubation period. The rate of new HIV infections at time $t-s$ is given by $I_H(t-s)$. The probability that an infected individual has an incubation period of length $s$ is given by the probability density function $g(s)$.\n\nTo find the total rate of AIDS diagnoses at time $t$, we must sum, or integrate, over all possible past infection times, which is equivalent to integrating over all possible incubation periods $s > 0$. This relationship is expressed as a convolution integral:\n$$A(t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} I_H(t-s) g(s) \\, ds$$\nThe problem specifies an exponential growth model for HIV incidence, $I_H(t) = I_0 \\exp(rt)$, and a gamma distribution for the incubation period $S$, with PDF $g(s) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(k)\\theta^{k}} s^{k-1} \\exp(-s/\\theta)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the convolution integral:\n$$A(t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( I_0 \\exp(r(t-s)) \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(k)\\theta^{k}} s^{k-1} \\exp(-s/\\theta) \\right) \\, ds$$\nWe can factor out terms that do not depend on the integration variable $s$:\n$$A(t) = I_0 \\exp(rt) \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(k)\\theta^{k}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-rs) s^{k-1} \\exp(-s/\\theta) \\, ds$$\nCombine the exponential terms inside the integral:\n$$A(t) = \\frac{I_0 \\exp(rt)}{\\Gamma(k)\\theta^{k}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} s^{k-1} \\exp\\left(-\\left(r + \\frac{1}{\\theta}\\right)s\\right) \\, ds$$\nThe integral is of the form $\\int_0^\\infty x^{\\alpha-1} \\exp(-\\lambda x) \\, dx$, which is related to the gamma function, $\\Gamma(\\alpha) = \\int_0^\\infty t^{\\alpha-1} \\exp(-t) \\, dt$. With a change of variable $u = (r + 1/\\theta)s$, so $s = u/(r+1/\\theta)$ and $ds = du/(r+1/\\theta)$, we have:\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\infty} s^{k-1} \\exp\\left(-\\left(r + \\frac{1}{\\theta}\\right)s\\right) \\, ds = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{u}{r + 1/\\theta}\\right)^{k-1} \\exp(-u) \\frac{du}{r + 1/\\theta}$$\n$$= \\frac{1}{(r + 1/\\theta)^k} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} u^{k-1} \\exp(-u) \\, du = \\frac{\\Gamma(k)}{(r + 1/\\theta)^k}$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $A(t)$:\n$$A(t) = \\frac{I_0 \\exp(rt)}{\\Gamma(k)\\theta^{k}} \\frac{\\Gamma(k)}{(r + 1/\\theta)^k} = I_0 \\exp(rt) \\frac{1}{(\\theta(r + 1/\\theta))^k} = I_0 \\exp(rt) \\frac{1}{(r\\theta + 1)^k}$$\nSo, the expected AIDS incidence is:\n$$A(t) = I_0 (1+r\\theta)^{-k} \\exp(rt)$$\nThis demonstrates that $A(t)$ inherits the exponential growth rate $r$ from $I_H(t)$. The multiplicative level factor, which scales $I_H(t)$ to yield $A(t)$, is $(1+r\\theta)^{-k}$.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Observed, Reported AIDS Incidence, $O(t)$**\n\nThe observed, reported AIDS incidence $O(t)$ is the rate at which diagnosed AIDS cases are entered into the surveillance system. A case reported at time $t$ was diagnosed at an earlier time $t-u$, where $u$ is the reporting delay. The rate of diagnoses at time $t-u$ is $A(t-u)$, and the probability of a delay of length $u$ is given by the PDF $h(u)$.\n\nSimilar to the previous derivation, $O(t)$ is the convolution of $A(t)$ and $h(u)$:\n$$O(t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} A(t-u) h(u) \\, du$$\nWe use the derived expression for $A(t)$ and the given PDF for the reporting delay $U$, which follows an exponential distribution with mean $\\delta$: $h(u) = \\frac{1}{\\delta}\\exp(-u/\\delta)$.\n$$O(t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( I_0 (1+r\\theta)^{-k} \\exp(r(t-u)) \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\delta}\\exp(-u/\\delta) \\right) \\, du$$\nFactor out terms not dependent on the integration variable $u$:\n$$O(t) = I_0 (1+r\\theta)^{-k} \\exp(rt) \\frac{1}{\\delta} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ru) \\exp(-u/\\delta) \\, du$$\n$$O(t) = \\frac{I_0 (1+r\\theta)^{-k} \\exp(rt)}{\\delta} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\left(r+\\frac{1}{\\delta}\\right)u\\right) \\, du$$\nThe integral is a standard exponential integral:\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\left(r+\\frac{1}{\\delta}\\right)u\\right) \\, du = \\left[ \\frac{-1}{r+1/\\delta} \\exp\\left(-\\left(r+\\frac{1}{\\delta}\\right)u\\right) \\right]_{u=0}^{\\infty} = 0 - \\left( \\frac{-1}{r+1/\\delta} \\right) = \\frac{1}{r+1/\\delta}$$\nSubstitute this result back into the expression for $O(t)$:\n$$O(t) = \\frac{I_0 (1+r\\theta)^{-k} \\exp(rt)}{\\delta} \\frac{1}{r+1/\\delta} = I_0 (1+r\\theta)^{-k} \\exp(rt) \\frac{1}{\\delta(r+1/\\delta)}$$\n$$O(t) = I_0 (1+r\\theta)^{-k} (1+r\\delta)^{-1} \\exp(rt)$$\nThis demonstrates that $O(t)$ also inherits the exponential growth rate $r$. The overall multiplicative level factor scaling $I_H(t)$ to $O(t)$ is $(1+r\\theta)^{-k} (1+r\\delta)^{-1}$. The relationship between $O(t)$ and $A(t)$ is simpler:\n$$O(t) = A(t) (1+r\\delta)^{-1}$$\n\n**3. Quantifying the Jump in Observed Incidence**\n\nThe problem describes a scenario where activism leads to a change in public health policy, reducing the mean reporting delay from $\\delta_{\\text{pre}}$ to $\\delta_{\\text{post}}$ at a specific time. We assume this change is instantaneous and does not affect the underlying HIV incidence $I_H(t)$ or the incubation period distribution $g(s)$. Consequently, the true AIDS incidence $A(t)$ is continuous through this change.\n\nJust before the change, the observed incidence is determined by $\\delta_{\\text{pre}}$:\n$$O_{\\text{pre}}(t) = A(t) (1+r\\delta_{\\text{pre}})^{-1}$$\nJust after the change, the observed incidence is determined by $\\delta_{\\text{post}}$:\n$$O_{\\text{post}}(t) = A(t) (1+r\\delta_{\\text{post}})^{-1}$$\nThe instantaneous multiplicative jump in the observed series $O(t)$ is the ratio of the value just after the change to the value just before the change:\n$$\\text{Jump} = \\frac{O_{\\text{post}}(t)}{O_{\\text{pre}}(t)} = \\frac{A(t) (1+r\\delta_{\\text{post}})^{-1}}{A(t) (1+r\\delta_{\\text{pre}})^{-1}} = \\frac{1+r\\delta_{\\text{pre}}}{1+r\\delta_{\\text{post}}}$$\nA naive analyst, unaware of the change in reporting delay, would observe this jump in $O(t)$ and might mistakenly attribute it to a sudden change in $A(t)$, i.e., a change in the epidemic's trajectory.\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n-   Growth rate $r = 0.25$ year$^{-1}$, which is $1/4$ year$^{-1}$.\n-   Mean delay before change $\\delta_{\\text{pre}} = 2$ years.\n-   Mean delay after change $\\delta_{\\text{post}} = 0.5$ years, which is $1/2$ year.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the jump:\n$$\\text{Jump} = \\frac{1 + r\\delta_{\\text{pre}}}{1 + r\\delta_{\\text{post}}} = \\frac{1 + (\\frac{1}{4})(2)}{1 + (\\frac{1}{4})(\\frac{1}{2})}$$\nNow, we compute the numerator and denominator:\n$$\\text{Numerator} = 1 + \\frac{2}{4} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}$$\n$$\\text{Denominator} = 1 + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{9}{8}$$\nThe jump is the ratio of these two values:\n$$\\text{Jump} = \\frac{3/2}{9/8} = \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\frac{8}{9} = \\frac{24}{18}$$\nSimplifying the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $6$:\n$$\\text{Jump} = \\frac{24 \\div 6}{18 \\div 6} = \\frac{4}{3}$$\nThe instantaneous multiplicative jump in observed AIDS cases is a factor of $4/3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}$$", "id": "4748353"}]}
