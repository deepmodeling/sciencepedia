By working through this exercise, you will not only learn how to calculate a standardized attack rate but also develop the critical skill of identifying how real-world historical circumstances, like wartime mobilization, can introduce bias into data and affect our interpretations.", "problem": "A city health department in $1918$ sought to compare its influenza experience during the autumn wave with other jurisdictions using age-standardized measures. In historical epidemiology, the attack rate is the proportion of a defined population that becomes ill during a specified epidemic period. For this city, the municipal census conducted in late $1917$ provided age-stratified denominators, and the Board of Health compiled age-stratified case counts for September–December $1918$. A national demographer later supplied a fixed “standard population” to enable direct age standardization across cities. Historical note: because of World War I (WWI) mobilization, many young adult males were temporarily absent from the city in late $1918$, but the municipal census denominators did not remove them.\n\nUse the following information, keeping all computations faithful to the data as given, without adjusting for mobilization:\n\n- City resident population (late $1917$ municipal census):\n  - Ages $0$–$14$: $80{,}000$\n  - Ages $15$–$34$: $120{,}000$\n  - Ages $35$–$64$: $90{,}000$\n  - Ages $\\geq 65$: $30{,}000$\n\n- Reported influenza cases during September–December $1918$ (Board of Health notifications):\n  - Ages $0$–$14$: $16{,}000$\n  - Ages $15$–$34$: $42{,}000$\n  - Ages $35$–$64$: $18{,}000$\n  - Ages $\\geq 65$: $3{,}000$\n\n- Standard population counts (for direct age standardization):\n  - Ages $0$–$14$: $28{,}000$\n  - Ages $15$–$34$: $35{,}000$\n  - Ages $35$–$64$: $27{,}000$\n  - Ages $\\geq 65$: $10{,}000$\n\nStarting from core definitions of age-specific attack rates and the logic of direct standardization, compute the directly age-standardized attack rate for the city for the autumn $1918$ wave using the supplied standard population.

Then, based solely on the historical note about mobilization and without altering any numbers, state whether the age-standardized attack rate computed from the unadjusted denominators is biased upward or downward relative to the true city experience, and justify the direction of bias in words.", "solution": "The problem requires two tasks: first, to compute the directly age-standardized attack rate for a city during the $1918$ influenza pandemic; and second, to assess the direction of bias in this calculation based on a historical note regarding military mobilization.\n\nTo begin, we perform the calculation for the directly age-standardized attack rate ($DSAR$). This procedure involves several steps:\n1.  Calculate the age-specific attack rates for the city's population.\n2.  Apply these rates to the standard population to find the expected number of cases.\n3.  Sum the expected cases and divide by the total standard population.\n\nLet the age strata be indexed by $i$, where $i=1$ corresponds to ages $0$–$14$, $i=2$ to ages $15$–$34$, $i=3$ to ages $35$–$64$, and $i=4$ to ages $\\geq 65$. Let $C_i$ be the number of reported influenza cases, $P_i$ be the city's population, and $S_i$ be the standard population for each stratum $i$.\n\nThe data provided are:\n- Stratum $1$: $P_1 = 80000$, $C_1 = 16000$, $S_1 = 28000$\n- Stratum $2$: $P_2 = 120000$, $C_2 = 42000$, $S_2 = 35000$\n- Stratum $3$: $P_3 = 90000$, $C_3 = 18000$, $S_3 = 27000$\n- Stratum $4$: $P_4 = 30000$, $C_4 = 3000$, $S_4 = 10000$\n\nThe age-specific attack rate, $AR_i$, for each stratum is defined as the ratio of cases to the population in that stratum:\n$$AR_i = \\frac{C_i}{P_i}$$\nCalculating this for each stratum:\n- $AR_1 = \\frac{16000}{80000} = 0.2$\n- $AR_2 = \\frac{42000}{120000} = 0.35$\n- $AR_3 = \\frac{18000}{90000} = 0.2$\n- $AR_4 = \\frac{3000}{30000} = 0.1$\n\nNext, we calculate the expected number of cases, $E_i$, in each stratum of the standard population by applying the city's age-specific attack rates:\n$$E_i = AR_i \\times S_i$$\n- $E_1 = 0.2 \\times 28000 = 5600$\n- $E_2 = 0.35 \\times 35000 = 12250$\n- $E_3 = 0.2 \\times 27000 = 5400$\n- $E_4 = 0.1 \\times 10000 = 1000$\n\nThe total number of expected cases, $E_{total}$, is the sum of the expected cases across all strata:\n$$E_{total} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} E_i = 5600 + 12250 + 5400 + 1000 = 24250$$\n\nThe total size of the standard population, $S_{total}$, is the sum of the stratum-specific populations:\n$$S_{total} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} S_i = 28000 + 35000 + 27000 + 10000 = 100000$$\n\nThe directly age-standardized attack rate ($DSAR$) is the ratio of the total expected cases to the total standard population:\n$$DSAR = \\frac{E_{total}}{S_{total}} = \\frac{24250}{100000} = 0.2425$$\n\nTo express this rate in cases per $1000$ persons, we multiply by $1000$:\n$$DSAR_{per \\, 1000} = 0.2425 \\times 1000 = 242.5$$\nThis value is already provided to four significant figures, as requested.\n\nNow, we address the second part of the problem concerning the direction of bias. The historical note indicates that due to World War I mobilization, the population denominator for young adults is inaccurate. Specifically, for the age stratum $15$–$34$, the census population $P_2 = 120000$ (from late $1917$) does not account for the temporary absence of many young men in late $1918$. This means the denominator used in our calculation is larger than the true population at risk.\n\nLet $P_{2, true}$ be the actual population in the $15$–$34$ age group present in the city during the epidemic period. From the historical note, we have $P_{2, true}  P_2$. The number of cases, $C_2 = 42000$, occurred within this true, smaller population.\n\nThe calculated age-specific attack rate for this stratum is $AR_2 = C_2 / P_2 = 0.35$.\nThe true age-specific attack rate for this stratum is $AR_{2, true} = C_2 / P_{2, true}$.\n\nSince $P_{2, true}  P_2$, it implies that $\\frac{1}{P_{2, true}} > \\frac{1}{P_2}$. Therefore, $AR_{2, true} > AR_2$. The calculated age-specific attack rate for the $15$–$34$ age group is an underestimate of the true rate experienced by the population actually present.\n\nThe $DSAR$ is a weighted average of the age-specific rates $AR_i$. Since the rate for the $15$–$34$ stratum, $AR_2$, is a significant component of this average and is known to be an underestimate, the overall $DSAR$ is also an underestimate of what the rate would be if calculated with the true population denominator.\n\nTherefore, the age-standardized attack rate computed from the unadjusted denominators is **biased downward** relative to the true city experience. The justification is that the denominator for the high-risk group of young adults was inflated, which artificially diluted the calculated risk for that group ($AR_2$) and subsequently lowered the overall standardized rate ($DSAR$). The calculated rate of $242.5$ per $1000$ underrepresents the actual severity of the epidemic's impact on the city's residents.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{242.5}$$", "id": "4748636"}, {"introduction": "After determining how many people fell ill, the next crucial question is assessing the pandemic's severity: how deadly was the virus? This exercise delves into the critical distinction between the Case Fatality Ratio ($CFR$), which measures deaths among known cases, and the Infection Fatality Ratio ($IFR$), which estimates deaths among all infected individuals, including those with mild or no symptoms. This distinction is vital because official case counts often represent only the \"tip of the iceberg.\" This problem guides you through a back-calculation method to estimate the true size of the infected population, revealing the hidden burden of the disease and providing a more accurate measure of its intrinsic severity [@problem_id:4748623].", "problem": "During the autumn wave of the $1918$ influenza pandemic in a single city, municipal records report the following cumulative counts for the entire wave: reported clinical influenza cases $C = 40{,}000$, recorded hospital admissions attributable to influenza or secondary pneumonia $H_{\\mathrm{rec}} = 2{,}250$, and death certificates listing influenza or pneumonia as the underlying cause $D = 1{,}600$.

The team adopts the standard epidemiologic definition that a cause-specific excess mortality rate for a given year is the observed cause-specific mortality rate in that year minus the expected cause-specific mortality rate based on a baseline period.
