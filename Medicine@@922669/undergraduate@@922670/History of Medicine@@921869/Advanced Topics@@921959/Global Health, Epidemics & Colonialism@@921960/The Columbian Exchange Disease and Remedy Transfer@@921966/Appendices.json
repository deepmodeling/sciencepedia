This exercise introduces the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, and connects it to the herd immunity threshold, which quantifies the proportion of a population that must become immune to stop an epidemic's spread. By calculating this threshold for diseases like smallpox and measles, you will gain a clear, quantitative insight into why their introduction into immunologically naive, or \"virgin soil,\" populations was so catastrophic [@problem_id:4764172].", "problem": "During the early phases of the Columbian Exchange, Old World pathogens such as smallpox and measles entered populations in the Americas that had no prior exposure, a condition often termed virgin soil. Consider the standard epidemiological definitions: the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is the expected number of secondary infections produced by one typical infectious individual in a fully susceptible population, and the herd immunity threshold $H$ is the minimal immune fraction in the population that prevents sustained transmission. Assume homogeneous mixing and sterilizing immunity upon infection or vaccination so that immunity removes individuals from the susceptible pool without affecting transmission among the remaining susceptibles.\n\nStarting from these definitions, derive the minimal immune fraction $H$ required to prevent sustained transmission as a function of $R_0$. Then, using historically plausible values, take smallpox to have $R_0$ in the interval $[3,6]$ and measles in the interval $[12,18]$. Evaluate $H$ at the endpoints of each interval. Present your four numerical results, in the order smallpox at $R_0=3$, smallpox at $R_0=6$, measles at $R_0=12$, measles at $R_0=18$, each as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.

Finally, briefly interpret the meaning of these thresholds for virgin soil populations in the context of the Columbian Exchange, based only on the definitions and assumptions stated.", "solution": "The problem asks for a derivation of the herd immunity threshold $H$ as a function of the basic reproduction number $R_0$, followed by a calculation of $H$ for specified values of $R_0$ corresponding to smallpox and measles, and an interpretation of the results in a historical context.\n\n**Derivation of $H$ as a function of $R_0$**\n\nThe basic reproduction number, $R_0$, represents the average number of new infections caused by a single infectious individual in a completely susceptible population.\n\nLet $s$ be the fraction of the population that is susceptible. In a population where a fraction of individuals are immune, not all contacts of an infectious person will be with a susceptible person. Due to the assumption of homogeneous mixing, the probability that a contact is with a susceptible individual is simply $s$.\n\nThe effective reproduction number, $R_e$, is the average number of new infections caused by a single infectious individual in a population with some level of immunity. It is given by the product of the basic reproduction number and the fraction of the population that is susceptible:\n$$R_e = R_0 \\cdot s$$\n\nSustained transmission of a disease occurs if, on average, each infected individual infects at least one other person, i.e., if $R_e \\ge 1$. To prevent sustained transmission, the number of secondary infections must be, on average, less than one. The critical threshold for preventing an epidemic from growing is when each infected person produces exactly one new infection. This condition is $R_e = 1$.\n$$R_0 \\cdot s_{crit} = 1$$\nHere, $s_{crit}$ is the critical fraction of susceptible individuals in the population below which sustained transmission does not occur. Solving for $s_{crit}$ gives:\n$$s_{crit} = \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\n\nThe population is composed of susceptible and immune individuals. Let $H$ be the fraction of the population that is immune. Assuming no other population states, the sum of the susceptible and immune fractions must be unity:\n$$s + H = 1$$\nThe herd immunity threshold, $H$, is defined as the minimal immune fraction required to prevent sustained transmission. This corresponds to the immune fraction when the susceptible fraction is at its critical value, $s_{crit}$.\n$$H = 1 - s_{crit}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $s_{crit}$ yields the relationship between the herd immunity threshold and the basic reproduction number:\n$$H = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\n\n**Calculation of $H$ for Smallpox and Measles**\n\nUsing the derived formula, we can now calculate the herd immunity thresholds for the given $R_0$ values.\n\n1.  **Smallpox at $R_0 = 3$**:\n    $$H = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.666666...$$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, $H = 0.6667$.\n\n2.  **Smallpox at $R_0 = 6$**:\n    $$H = 1 - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{6} \\approx 0.833333...$$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, $H = 0.8333$.\n\n3.  **Measles at $R_0 = 12$**:\n    $$H = 1 - \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{11}{12} \\approx 0.916666...$$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, $H = 0.9167$.\n\n4.  **Measles at $R_0 = 18$**:\n    $$H = 1 - \\frac{1}{18} = \\frac{17}{18} \\approx 0.944444...$$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, $H = 0.9444$.\n\n**Interpretation for Virgin Soil Populations**\n\nA \"virgin soil\" population is one with no pre-existing immunity to a given pathogen. In such a population, the initial immune fraction is $H = 0$, and the susceptible fraction is $s = 1$. When a pathogen like smallpox or measles is introduced, the epidemic will spread rapidly because $R_e = R_0 \\cdot s = R_0 \\cdot 1 = R_0$, which is much greater than $1$.\n\nThe calculated herd immunity thresholds ($H$) represent the proportion of the population that must become immune for the epidemic to cease its sustained spread. In the historical context of the Columbian Exchange, before the advent of vaccination, immunity could only be acquired through infection and subsequent recovery. Therefore, the high herd immunity thresholds calculated—ranging from $66.67\\%$ to $83.33\\%$ for smallpox and from $91.67\\%$ to $94.44\\%$ for measles—quantify the immense scale of the outbreak required for the disease to \"burn out\" in a non-immune population. These figures imply that a catastrophic proportion of the population would have to contract the disease to reach the threshold where transmission naturally declines. This mathematical relationship explains why the introduction of these highly transmissible pathogens to the immunologically naive populations of the Americas resulted in devastating demographic collapse.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.6667 & 0.8333 & 0.9167 & 0.9444 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4764172"}, {"introduction": "While $R_0$ is a powerful concept, it can seem abstract.
