I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe objective is to find the minimum equal sample size per arm, $n$, for a two-sample test of proportions.\n\nFirst, we define the relevant parameters from the problem statement. The probabilities of paralytic polio in the control and intervention arms are:\n-   Control arm probability: $p_1 = \\frac{100}{100,000} = 0.001$\n-   Intervention arm probability: $p_2 = \\frac{40}{100,000} = 0.0004$\n\nThe hypotheses for a two-sided test are:\n-   Null hypothesis, $H_0$: $p_1 = p_2$. There is no difference in polio incidence between the two groups.\n-   Alternative hypothesis, $H_A$: $p_1 \\neq p_2$. There is a difference in polio incidence.\n\nLet $\\hat{p}_1$ and $\\hat{p}_2$ be the sample proportions of polio cases in the control and intervention arms, respectively, each of size $n$. By the central limit theorem, the difference in sample proportions, $\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2$, is approximately normally distributed.\n\nThe test statistic for comparing two proportions is given by:\n$$\nZ = \\frac{\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2}{\\text{SE}(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2)}\n$$\nUnder the null hypothesis $H_0$, the proportions are equal, so we use a pooled proportion $\\hat{p}_{\\text{pool}} = \\frac{n\\hat{p}_1 + n\\hat{p}_2}{n+n} = \\frac{\\hat{p}_1 + \\hat{p}_2}{2}$ to estimate the common variance. The standard error under $H_0$ is:\n$$\n\\text{SE}_0 = \\sqrt{\\hat{p}_{\\text{pool}}(1-\\hat{p}_{\\text{pool}})\\left(\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\hat{p}_{\\text{pool}}(1-\\hat{p}_{\\text{pool}})}{n}}\n$$\nFor planning purposes, we use the expected values. The problem specifies to use the \"common proportion as the planning value,\" which we take as the average of the expected proportions under $H_A$:\n$$\n\\bar{p} = \\frac{p_1 + p_2}{2} = \\frac{0.001 + 0.0004}{2} = 0.0007\n$$\nThe test criterion for a two-sided test at a significance level $\\alpha=0.05$ is to reject $H_0$ if $|Z| > z_{\\alpha/2}$, where $z_{\\alpha/2} = z_{0.025} \\approx 1.95996$. This corresponds to rejecting $H_0$ if $|\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2| > z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{n}}$.\n\nPower is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when $H_A$ is true. We are given the desired power $1-\\beta = 0.8$, so $\\beta=0.2$. The corresponding standard normal quantile is $z_{1-\\beta} = z_{0.8} \\approx 0.84162$.\n\nUnder the alternative hypothesis, the distribution of $\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2$ is centered at $p_1 - p_2$.

For this probability to be $1-\\beta$, the argument of the probability function must be equal to $-z_{1-\\beta}$:\n$$\n\\frac{z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{n}} - (p_1-p_2)}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1) + p_2(1-p_2)}{n}}} = -z_{1-\\beta}\n$$\nRearranging to solve for the difference $p_1-p_2$:\n$$\np_1 - p_2 = z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{n}} + z_{1-\\beta}\\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1) + p_2(1-p_2)}{n}}\n$$\nThe problem states: \"Take the variance under the null hypothesis to use the common proportion as the planning value.\" This is an instruction to use the null hypothesis variance, based on $\\bar{p}$, as an approximation for the alternative hypothesis variance as well. This is a common simplification, justified when $p_1$ and $p_2$ are close, as is the case here. Applying this simplification, we set $\\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1) + p_2(1-p_2)} \\approx \\sqrt{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\np_1 - p_2 \\approx (z_{\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta}) \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{n}}\n$$\nSolving for $n$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{n} \\approx \\frac{(z_{\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta}) \\sqrt{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}}{p_1 - p_2}\n$$\n$$\nn \\approx \\frac{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})(z_{\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2}{(p_1-p_2)^2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numeric values:\n-   $p_1 = 0.001$\n-   $p_2 = 0.0004$\n-   $p_1 - p_2 = 0.0006$\n-   $\\bar{p} = 0.0007$\n-   $1-\\bar{p} = 0.9993$\n-   $z_{\\alpha/2} = z_{0.025} \\approx 1.959964$\n-   $z_{1-\\beta} = z_{0.8} \\approx 0.841621$\n-   $z_{\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta} \\approx 1.959964 + 0.841621 = 2.801585$\n\nPlugging these into the formula for $n$:\n$$\nn \\approx \\frac{2(0.0007)(0.9993)(2.801585)^2}{(0.0006)^2}\n$$\n$$\nn \\approx \\frac{(0.00139902)(7.84888)}{3.6 \\times 10^{-7}}\n$$\n$$\nn \\approx \\frac{0.0109795}{3.6 \\times 10^{-7}}\n$$\n$$\nn \\approx 30498.61\n$$\nSince the sample size must be an integer, we would need at least $30,499$ participants per arm.
