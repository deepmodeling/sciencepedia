The town’s tax records and contemporaneous inventories indicate an average household size of $5$ individuals during the outbreak. Using the epidemiological definition of Secondary Attack Rate (SAR), which treats SAR as the probability that a susceptible household contact of a primary case develops disease within a specified observation window, estimate the household SAR under the following assumptions that are standard for first-pass outbreak analysis: each of the $12$ primary cases occurred in a different household, the population was immunologically naive at baseline, and each secondary case occurred among household members who were initially susceptible at the time of the primary case’s onset. For the denominator, approximate the number of susceptible household contacts by subtracting the primary case from the average household size and multiplying by the number of households. Round your final estimate to four significant figures and express it as a decimal (do not use a percent sign). Additionally, explain concisely how household clustering and record-keeping practices in the Black Death era could bias this SAR estimate upward or downward, without altering your numerical result.", "solution": "The appropriate starting point is the epidemiological definition of Secondary Attack Rate (SAR): SAR is the probability that a susceptible contact of a primary case becomes a case within a specified time window. Let $p$ denote the SAR to be estimated from the data.\n\nUnder the stated assumptions, there are $12$ distinct households with one primary case each. The average household size is $5$, so the number of susceptible contacts per household is the household size minus the primary case, namely $5 - 1 = 4$. Therefore, the total number of initially susceptible contacts across all households is\n$$\n12 \\times 4 = 48.\n$$\nThe parish register reports $25$ secondary cases within the $7$-day window. The empirical estimator of $p$ is the ratio of secondary cases to the number of susceptible contacts exposed to the primary case:\n$$\n\\hat{p} \\;=\\; \\frac{25}{48}.\n$$\nCompute the value:\n$$\n\\frac{25}{48} \\;=\\; 0.520833\\ldots\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures and expressing as a decimal as required gives\n$$\n0.5208.\n$$\n\nDiscussion of potential clustering biases that could affect $\\hat{p}$ without changing the computed value:\n- Misclassification of co-primary cases: If multiple household members were infected from a common external source (for example, shared exposure to infected fleas carried by rats) and died in close succession, some of the $25$ deaths may be co-primary rather than secondary. This would inflate the numerator relative to true secondary transmission and bias $\\hat{p}$ upward.\n- Household size heterogeneity and use of the average: Using an average of $5$ to represent all households ignores variability. If larger households are more likely to appear in the register (for example, because they generate more events), then the true number of susceptible contacts could be larger than $48$, biasing $\\hat{p}$ downward; conversely, if smaller households are overrepresented, $\\hat{p}$ could be biased upward.\n- Right-censoring and incomplete follow-up: If some secondary cases occurred after the $7$-day window and were not counted, the numerator is undercounted, biasing $\\hat{p}$ downward.\n- Differential recording and selection bias: Parish registers may more completely record deaths in prominent or larger households, potentially altering both numerator and denominator in complex ways. For example, better-recorded households with intense within-household transmission could bias $\\hat{p}$ upward, whereas underreporting of late or non-classic plague deaths could bias it downward.\n- Transmission pathway in the Black Death: For bubonic plague, transmission is often vector-borne via fleas rather than direct person-to-person. Treating household cases as secondary to the primary may overstate person-to-person contagion and inflate $\\hat{p}$ if common-vector exposure dominates. In pneumonic clusters, however, true within-household secondary transmission is more plausible, so the bias direction depends on the local clinical form and context.\n- Depletion of susceptibles and competing risks: If some household members left or died of other causes before they could be exposed, the effective denominator would be smaller than $48$, tending to increase $\\hat{p}$.\n\nThese factors illustrate that while $\\hat{p} = 25/48$ is the correct computation under the stated assumptions, historical clustering and recording practices can systematically bias the estimate upward or downward relative to the true household SAR during the Black Death.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5208}$$", "id": "4744451"}, {"introduction": "Zooming out from the household to the national level reveals the Black Death's truly catastrophic demographic impact.

Consider a stylized but historically plausible scenario: before the plague, the nominal daily wage of an agricultural worker is $w_0$ and the general price level (indexed to a pre-plague base) is $P_0 = 1$. After the demographic shock reduces the labor force and contracts output, nominal daily wages rise by $40\\%$ while the general price level rises by $10\\%$ relative to the base, yielding post-plague values $w_1$ and $P_1$.
