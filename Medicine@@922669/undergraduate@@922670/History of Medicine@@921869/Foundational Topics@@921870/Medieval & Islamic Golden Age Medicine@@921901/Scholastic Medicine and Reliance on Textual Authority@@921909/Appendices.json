In addition, practica (including bedside exercises and materia medica preparation) total $3$ hours per week. All weeks are identical in structure and there are no cancellations or special sessions.

Your explanation should be qualitative and should rely on those definitions rather than on anecdotal claims.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is self-contained, mathematically consistent, and well-posed. All data and definitions required for the calculation and subsequent qualitative analysis are provided. The scenario is a hypothetical yet historically plausible construct designed to test quantitative reasoning and the ability to connect a numerical result to a defined conceptual framework.\n\nThe problem requires two parts: first, a calculation of the proportion of instructional time devoted to textual exposition, and second, a qualitative explanation of how this proportion reflects the epistemic principles of scholasticism.\n\nFirst, let us define the components of the weekly instructional time based on the givens.\nLet $T_G$ be the weekly hours for lectures on Galen, $T_A$ be the weekly hours for lectures on Avicenna, and $T_H$ be the weekly hours for lectures on Hippocrates.\nLet $T_P$ be the weekly hours for practica.\nThe given values are:\n$T_G = 2$ hours\n$T_A = 1.5$ hours\n$T_H = 1$ hour\n$T_P = 3$ hours\n\nThe term lasts for $N_w = 12$ weeks.\n\n\"Textual exposition\" is defined as the time spent in lectures on Galen, Avicenna, and Hippocrates. The total weekly time for textual exposition, $T_{textual}$, is the sum of the time for these lectures.\n$$T_{textual} = T_G + T_A + T_H = 2 + 1.5 + 1 = 4.5 \\text{ hours}$$\n\nThe total instructional time per week, $T_{total}$, is the sum of the time for textual exposition and the time for practica.\n$$T_{total} = T_{textual} + T_P = 4.5 + 3 = 7.5 \\text{ hours}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the proportion of total instructional time devoted to textual exposition over the entire term. A proportion is the ratio of a part to the whole.\nLet $P$ be the desired proportion.\nThe total time for textual exposition over the term is $T_{textual} \\times N_w$.\nThe total instructional time over the term is $T_{total} \\times N_w$.\n\nThe proportion $P$ is therefore:\n$$P = \\frac{\\text{Total textual exposition time}}{\\text{Total instructional time}} = \\frac{T_{textual} \\times N_w}{T_{total} \\times N_w}$$\nSince the weekly schedule is identical for all $N_w = 12$ weeks, the factor $N_w$ cancels from the numerator and the denominator. The proportion for the entire term is identical to the proportion for a single week.\n$$P = \\frac{T_{textual}}{T_{total}} = \\frac{4.5}{7.5}$$\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $10$ to remove the decimals:\n$$P = \\frac{45}{75} = \\frac{3 \\times 15}{5 \\times 15} = \\frac{3}{5}$$\n\nAs a decimal, this is:\n$$P = 0.6$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P = 0.6000$$\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we must explain how this proportion reflects the epistemic weighting of textual authority versus empirical practice in the specified scholastic curriculum.\n\nThe computed proportion is $P = 0.6000$, which means that $60\\%$ of the total instructional time is dedicated to textual exposition, while the remaining $40\\%$ is dedicated to practica. A proportion greater than $0.5$ indicates a majority focus on lectures derived from authoritative texts. This quantitative imbalance directly reflects the core tenets of scholastic epistemology as defined in the problem.\n\nThe problem specifies these tenets as the \"priority of textual authority, use of lectio and disputatio, and the derivative status of observation within the curricular hierarchy.\"\n1.  **Priority of Textual Authority**: The fact that the majority of curriculum time ($60\\%$) is spent on the *lectio* (reading and commentary) of authoritative figures like Galen, Avicenna, and Hippocrates is a direct, quantifiable manifestation of their epistemic priority. Knowledge is primarily sought from, and validated against, these established texts.\n2.  **Derivative Status of Observation**: The practica, representing empirical practice and observation, constitute a smaller portion of the curriculum ($40\\%$). This subordinate position in terms of time allocation demonstrates that empirical experience is not the primary source of medical knowledge in this system. Instead, its role is supplementary or illustrative. The hands-on work likely serves to demonstrate or apply the principles already established in the authoritative texts, rather than to challenge them or to generate new, foundational knowledge. The curriculum structure thus embodies an epistemic hierarchy where observation is interpreted through, and is secondary to, the received wisdom of the textual tradition.\n\nIn summary, the calculated proportion of $0.6000$ provides a numerical basis for confirming that the curriculum's structure is a direct reflection of a scholastic epistemology that weighs textual authority more heavily than empirical practice.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6000}$$", "id": "4763294"}, {"introduction": "A core intellectual challenge for the scholastic physician was not simply reading the ancient authorities, but actively reconciling them when they presented conflicting information.

You will act as the scholastic synthesizer, creating a single, harmonized dosage by calculating a weighted average based on a plausible model of textual reliability, demonstrating how intellectual tools were used to manage and unify a complex textual inheritance.", "problem": "In the scholastic medical tradition, reconciliation of divergent textual authorities often required harmonizing differing prescriptions rather than rejecting one authority outright. Consider a case in which two Latin translations of a therapeutic instruction, both tracing back to a prestigious Galenic-Arabic lineage, provide different dosage values for the same compound, expressed in apothecaries’ drachms. Translation A prescribes a dose of $6$ drachms, while Translation B prescribes a dose of $4$ drachms. You are asked to construct a compromise dosage that reflects the scholastic goal of concordance by weighting each translation according to its reliability.\n\nAssume the following historically motivated reliability model:\n- Copying accuracy is quantified by a measured scribal error rate $e$ per $1000$ words; lower $e$ implies higher reliability.\n- Textual proximity to the lost Arabic exemplar is encoded in a multiplicative contextual factor $m$; higher $m$ implies higher reliability.\n- The unnormalized reliability score is defined by the proportionality $R \\propto \\frac{m}{e}$.

It constitutes a well-posed mathematical problem, providing all necessary data, a clear objective, and a defined model. The historical context serves as a framing device for a standard calculation of a weighted average, and it does not introduce any scientific inaccuracies or logical contradictions. The problem is self-contained, objective, and formalizable.\n\nThe task is to compute a compromise dosage by calculating a weighted average of two given dosages, where the weights are derived from a specified reliability model. The final result must be converted to grams and rounded.\n\nThe given data are:\n- Dosage from Translation A: $D_A = 6$ drachms\n- Dosage from Translation B: $D_B = 4$ drachms\n- Parameters for Translation A: scribal error rate $e_A = 1.2$, contextual factor $m_A = 1.1$\n- Parameters for Translation B: scribal error rate $e_B = 2.8$, contextual factor $m_B = 0.9$\n- Conversion factor: $1$ apothecaries' drachm $= 3.888$ grams\n\nThe process is as follows:\n1.

Compute the weighted average dosage ($D_C$) in drachms.\n4.  Convert the dosage to grams and round to four significant figures.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Unnormalized Reliability Scores**\nThe unnormalized reliability score, $R$, is defined by the proportionality $R \\propto \\frac{m}{e}$. We can set the proportionality constant to $1$ without loss of generality, as it will cancel out during normalization. Thus, the scores for Translation A and Translation B are:\n$$R_A = \\frac{m_A}{e_A}$$\n$$R_B = \\frac{m_B}{e_B}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R_A = \\frac{1.1}{1.2} = \\frac{11}{12}$$\n$$R_B = \\frac{0.9}{2.8} = \\frac{9}{28}$$\n\n**Step 2: Normalize the Scores to Obtain Weights**\nThe normalized weights, $w_A$ and $w_B$, are found by dividing each score by the sum of all scores, $R_{total} = R_A + R_B$.\nFirst, we compute $R_{total}$:\n$$R_{total} = \\frac{11}{12} + \\frac{9}{28}$$\nThe least common multiple of the denominators $12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3$ and $28 = 2^2 \\cdot 7$ is $2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = 84$.\n$$R_{total} = \\frac{11 \\cdot 7}{84} + \\frac{9 \\cdot 3}{84} = \\frac{77}{84} + \\frac{27}{84} = \\frac{104}{84} = \\frac{26}{21}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the individual weights:\n$$w_A = \\frac{R_A}{R_{total}} = \\frac{11/12}{26/21} = \\frac{11}{12} \\cdot \\frac{21}{26} = \\frac{11 \\cdot (3 \\cdot 7)}{(4 \\cdot 3) \\cdot (2 \\cdot 13)} = \\frac{11 \\cdot 7}{4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 13} = \\frac{77}{104}$$\n$$w_B = \\frac{R_B}{R_{total}} = \\frac{9/28}{26/21} = \\frac{9}{28} \\cdot \\frac{21}{26} = \\frac{9 \\cdot (3 \\cdot 7)}{(4 \\cdot 7) \\cdot 26} = \\frac{9 \\cdot 3}{4 \\cdot 26} = \\frac{27}{104}$$\nAs a check, the weights must sum to $1$: $w_A + w_B = \\frac{77}{104} + \\frac{27}{104} = \\frac{104}{104} = 1$. The normalization is correct.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the Weighted Average Dosage**\nThe compromise dosage, $D_C$, is the weighted average of $D_A$ and $D_B$:\n$$D_C = w_A D_A + w_B D_B$$\nSubstituting the values for the weights and dosages:\n$$D_C = \\left(\\frac{77}{104}\\right) (6) + \\left(\\frac{27}{104}\\right) (4)$$\n$$D_C = \\frac{77 \\cdot 6 + 27 \\cdot 4}{104} = \\frac{462 + 108}{104} = \\frac{570}{104}$$\nSimplifying the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, $2$:\n$$D_C = \\frac{285}{52} \\text{ drachms}$$\n\n**Step 4: Convert to Grams and Round**\nThe final step is to convert the dosage from drachms to grams and round the result.

Consider a hypothetical $30$-day month for which the monastery scribe recorded the following lunar markers: new moon on day $2$, first quarter on day $9$, full moon on day $16$, and third quarter on day $24$. Assume the following historically realistic idealizations for classification of days by lunar phase within this month:\n- Days strictly between new moon and full moon are waxing; days strictly between full moon and the next new moon are waning.\n- Day $1$ is waning (as it precedes the new moon on day $2$). Quarter and syzygy days themselves (days $2$, $9$, $16$, $24$) are excluded by the textual rule below regardless of waxing or waning status.\n\nThe textual authority (to be treated as binding for this exercise) states:\n- Bloodletting is permissible only on waning days.\n- It is forbidden on any day within $2$ days (inclusive) of any quarter or syzygy, that is, for any day whose absolute difference from any of $2$, $9$, $16$, or $24$ is at most $2$.\n- It is also forbidden on the so-called Egyptian days, taken here as the set $\\{3,7,15,17,23,25,27\\}$.\n\nA physician’s ledger for this same month records bloodlettings on the following days:\n$\\{1,5,19,20,21,22,28,29\\}$.\n\nStarting only from the definitions above (the reliance on textual authority, the meaning of waxing versus waning with respect to the recorded lunar markers, and the set-theoretic interpretation of “within $2$ days”), determine the set of permissible days according to the textual rule and then compute the physician’s compliance rate, defined as the number of ledger bloodlettings that fall on permissible days divided by the total number of ledger bloodlettings.

The primary condition is that bloodletting is permissible only on waning days.\n\nLet $W$ be the set of waning days. The problem defines waning days as those \"strictly between full moon and the next new moon\" and adds the specific stipulation that \"Day $1$ is waning\". The full moon occurs on day $16$.
