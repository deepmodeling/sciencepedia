This first practice invites you to step into the role of a monastic administrator, using basic rate calculations and statistical principles to quantify the productivity of a scriptorium. By calculating the monthly output of folios and the expected number of errors that require correction, you will develop a tangible sense of the balance between production speed and quality control in medieval manuscript creation [@problem_id:4756737].", "problem": "A Benedictine monastery in the twelfth century operates a scriptorium to preserve and disseminate medical treatises, including works attributed to Galen and commentaries used in monastic infirmaries. The scriptorium employs $8$ scribes and $2$ correctors. Each scribe copies at a steady rate of $2$ folios per day of work. The month under consideration has $30$ calendar days, but the community observes $4$ Sundays and $2$ major feast days on which no copying or correcting is performed, leaving $24$ working days. Historical marginal notes indicate that copying errors occur independently and can be modeled, for planning purposes, as a Poisson process with intensity $\\lambda = 0.5$ errors per folio; thus the expected number of errors per folio is $0.5$. Assume that every error identified by the correctors must be addressed, and that correction capacity does not constrain copying output within this month.\n\nUsing as fundamental bases the definition of rate as output per unit time, the additivity of outputs across independent workers, the definition of expected value for a Poisson-distributed count, and the linearity of expectation across independent and identically distributed items, derive from first principles the monthly throughput in folios and the expected number of corrections needed during the month.

If each scribe produces $r$ folios per day of work, and there are $n_{s}$ scribes who can work in parallel without interfering, then the total daily output is\n$$\nR_{\\text{day}} = n_{s} \\times r.\n$$\nHere, $n_{s} = 8$ and $r = 2$ folios per day. Therefore,\n$$\nR_{\\text{day}} = 8 \\times 2 = 16 \\text{ folios per day.}\n$$\nProduction over a period depends on the number of working days. Let $D$ denote the number of working days in the month. The problem specifies a $30$-day month with $4$ Sundays and $2$ feast days without work, so\n$$\nD = 30 - 4 - 2 = 24 \\text{ days.}\n$$\nThus, the monthly throughput in folios, denoted $N$, is given by the product of daily rate and working days:\n$$\nN = R_{\\text{day}} \\times D = 16 \\times 24 = 384 \\text{ folios per month.}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the expected number of corrections. The problem states that copying errors occur independently and can be modeled as a Poisson process with intensity $\\lambda = 0.5$ errors per folio.

This exercise powerfully connects the scribal act of interpretation to the principles of toxicology and patient safety.", "problem": "In a twelfth-century Benedictine infirmary, physicians relied on copied herbals whose dosage lines often used apothecary abbreviations. A common abbreviation for one scruple was the symbol for scruple, written as a ligature that could be mistaken for the ounce symbol when poorly preserved or hastily expanded. Consider a prescription intended to deliver one scruple of a sedative herb, originally written as a single scruple symbol. Due to abbreviation expansion ambiguity in the preserved text, a scribe might misread the intended dose.\n\nUse the following historically grounded apothecary conversions: one dram equals three scruples, and one ounce equals eight drams. Thus, one ounce equals twenty-four scruples. Suppose the intended dose is one scruple, but under the worst-case misreading the dose administered becomes one ounce.\n\nAssume the probability of a severe adverse outcome from this herb increases with dose according to a standard dose–response model based on a Poisson hazard, $$P(d) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda d),$$ where $d$ is measured in scruples and $\\lambda$ is the hazard rate per scruple. The infirmary’s guideline sets an acceptable threshold $T$ for the expected probability of a severe adverse outcome per administration. If the scribe misreads with probability $p$, the expected probability of a severe adverse outcome is given by the law of total expectation applied to two possible administered doses.\n\nGiven:\n- Intended dose $d_{0} = 1$ scruple,\n- Worst-case misread dose $d_{w} = 24$ scruples,\n- Hazard rate $\\lambda = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ per scruple,\n- Threshold $T = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}$,\n\ndetermine the maximum misreading probability $p_{\\max}$ such that the expected severe adverse outcome probability does not exceed the threshold $T$.

The adoption process is irreversible, so this term ensures that the adoption probability $p_i$ can only increase. The term $\\lambda$ is the effective transmission rate, given by $\\lambda = (1-c)/L$, where $L$ is the mean latency for a transmission attempt and $c$ is the probability of censorship. The summation term represents the total \"force of infection\" on node $i$ from its neighbors.\n\nThe notation in the problem statement can be clarified. Let us define a standard adjacency matrix $M$ where $M_{uv}=1$ if there is a directed edge from $u$ to $v$. The rate of increase of $p_i$ is proportional to the sum of influences from all nodes $j$ that have a directed edge to $i$. This sum is $\\sum_{j \\to i} p_j(t)$, which is equivalent to $\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} M_{ji} p_j(t)$. This is the $i$-th component of the vector $M^T\\mathbf{p}$.

Node $7$ remains isolated.\n2.  **Network $\\mathcal{B}$**: An $8 \\times 8$ matrix of all ones, with the main diagonal being zeros.\n\nFor each test case, we first calculate the effective rate $\\lambda$. For Case 5 where $c=1.0$, $\\lambda=0$. In this scenario, $d\\mathbf{p}/dt = \\mathbf{0}$, so the probabilities do not change. The final state is $\\mathbf{p}(T) = \\mathbf{p}(0) = [1, 0, \\dots, 0]^T$, and the average adoption level is $\\bar{p}(T) = 1/n = 1/8 = 0.125$.

It is noted that Case $3$ ($L=5, c=0.9$) and Case $4$ ($L=50, c=0.0$) both yield an identical effective rate $\\lambda=0.02$ on the same network $\\mathcal{A}$.
