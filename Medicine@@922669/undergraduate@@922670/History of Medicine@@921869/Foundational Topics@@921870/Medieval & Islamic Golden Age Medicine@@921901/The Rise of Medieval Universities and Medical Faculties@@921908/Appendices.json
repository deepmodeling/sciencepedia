It presents a standard exercise in discrete probability theory based on a given empirical dataset. All necessary data are provided, and the tasks are clearly defined, leading to a unique, verifiable solution. Thus, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe problem asks for two tasks: first, to construct an empirical probability distribution, and second, to derive and compute a specific measure of institutional concentration, defined as the probability that two individuals drawn independently with replacement from the population share the same institutional origin.\n\nLet the total number of physicians in the dataset be $N$. The problem provides $N = 300$.\nThe dataset is partitioned into four categories corresponding to the institutions of graduation. Let the institutions be indexed as follows:\n$1$: University of Montpellier (M)\n$2$: University of Bologna (B)\n$3$: University of Paris (P)\n$4$: Other institutions (O)\n\nThe counts for each category are given as:\n$n_M = 120$\n$n_B = 90$\n$n_P = 60$\n$n_O = 30$\n\nWe can verify that the counts sum to the total population: $120 + 90 + 60 + 30 = 300 = N$.\n\n**1. Empirical Degree Distribution**\n\nThe problem specifies that the empirical probability $p_i$ for each category $i$ should be calculated as the count $n_i$ for that category divided by the total count $N$.\n\nThe probability of a physician having a degree from Montpellier is:\n$$ p_M = \\frac{n_M}{N} = \\frac{120}{300} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4 $$\n\nThe probability of a physician having a degree from Bologna is:\n$$ p_B = \\frac{n_B}{N} = \\frac{90}{300} = \\frac{3}{10} = 0.3 $$\n\nThe probability of a physician having a degree from Paris is:\n$$ p_P = \\frac{n_P}{N} = \\frac{60}{300} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2 $$\n\nThe probability of a physician having a degree from another institution is:\n$$ p_O = \\frac{n_O}{N} = \\frac{30}{300} = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1 $$\n\nThis set of probabilities $\\{p_M, p_B, p_P, p_O\\}$ constitutes the empirical discrete probability distribution over the four institutional categories. We can confirm that the probabilities sum to unity: $0.4 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.1 = 1.0$.\n\n**2. Derivation and Computation of the \"Institutional Influence\" Measure**\n\nThe measure, which we will denote by $I$, is defined as the probability that two physicians drawn independently (with replacement) from this population hold degrees from the same institution.\n\nLet $D_1$ and $D_2$ be two random variables representing the institutional origin of the first and second physician drawn, respectively. Because the draws are independent and with replacement, $D_1$ and $D_2$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. The probability mass function for both is given by the empirical distribution derived above: for any category $i \\in \\{M, B, P, O\\}$, $P(D_1=i)=p_i$ and $P(D_2=i)=p_i$.\n\nThe event that both physicians are from the same institution is the event $D_1 = D_2$. This event can be expressed as the disjoint union of the events where both physicians are from Montpellier, both are from Bologna, both are from Paris, or both are from the 'Other' category.\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\{D_1 = D_2\\} = \\{D_1=M, D_2=M\\} \\cup \\{D_1=B, D_2=B\\} \\cup \\{D_1=P, D_2=P\\} \\cup \\{D_1=O, D_2=O\\} $$\n\nSince these constituent events are mutually exclusive (disjoint), the probability of their union is the sum of their individual probabilities:\n$$ I = P(D_1 = D_2) = P(D_1=M, D_2=M) + P(D_1=B, D_2=B) + P(D_1=P, D_2=P) + P(D_1=O, D_2=O) $$\n\nThe core definition of independence between two events $A$ and $B$ states that $P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$. Because the two draws are independent, we have for each category $i$:\n$$ P(D_1=i, D_2=i) = P(D_1=i) \\times P(D_2=i) $$\nSince the draws are from the same distribution, $P(D_1 = i) = P(D_2 = i) = p_i$. Therefore:\n$$ P(D_1=i, D_2=i) = p_i \\times p_i = p_i^2 $$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $I$, we obtain the closed-form expression for the institutional influence measure in terms of the empirical probabilities:\n$$ I = p_M^2 + p_B^2 + p_P^2 + p_O^2 $$\nIn general, for a discrete distribution with $k$ categories, this measure (known as the Simpson index or Herfindahl-Hirschman Index) is given by:\n$$ I = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i^2 $$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $I$ for the given dataset using the probabilities calculated in the first part.\n$$ I = (0.4)^2 + (0.3)^2 + (0.2)^2 + (0.1)^2 $$\n$$ I = 0.16 + 0.09 + 0.04 + 0.01 $$\n$$ I = 0.30 $$\n\nThe problem requires the final value to be reported as a decimal number rounded to four significant figures. The exact value is $0.3$, which can be written with four significant figures as $0.3000$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.3000}\n$$", "id": "4776729"}, {"introduction": "Having seen the big picture of university influence, let's zoom in on the life of an individual student. Before the printing press, access to texts was a major bottleneck, managed by systems like the pecia system, where students rented and copied manuscript sections.

Consider a student in a medical faculty whose principal compilation, the Articella, totals $300$ folia. The student reads at a uniform rate of $15$ folia per week when unimpeded. The university calendar schedules formal disputations every fourth week, and during a disputation week one-third of the student’s study time is redirected to preparation and attendance for argumentation, reducing reading time accordingly for that week.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definition that cumulative work completed equals rate multiplied by time, and assuming uniform rates within each type of week, perform the following:\n\n1. Compute the minimum number of weeks, $T_{\\min}$, required to complete the Articella under uninterrupted reading at the baseline rate.\n2. To preserve completion within $T_{\\min}$ weeks, propose a pacing adjustment by choosing a single constant reading rate $r$ (in folia per week) for non-disputation weeks, with disputation weeks limited to the fraction of time available for reading.

Problem Validation**\n\nThe first step is to validate the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Total folia of the *Articella*: $W = 300$ folia.\n- Unimpeded (baseline) reading rate: $r_0 = 15$ folia per week.\n- Disputation schedule: Every fourth week.\n- Reading time reduction during a disputation week: One-third of study time is redirected, meaning two-thirds of the time is available for reading.\n- Task 1: Compute the minimum number of weeks, $T_{\\min}$, for completion with uninterrupted reading at rate $r_0$.\n- Task 2: Determine a new constant reading rate, $r$, for non-disputation weeks such that the total work of $300$ folia is completed in exactly $T_{\\min}$ weeks, accounting for the reduced rate during disputation weeks.\n- The disputation cadence applies over the entire $T_{\\min}$-week interval.\n- The reading rate during disputation weeks is reduced proportionally to the available time.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is a mathematical exercise in rates, work, and time, framed within a historical context. The underlying principle ($Work = Rate \\times Time$) is fundamental and sound. The historical context, while specific, serves as a narrative frame and does not introduce scientific inaccuracies.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient information to determine unique values for the two requested quantities, $T_{\\min}$ and $r$. The objectives are clearly stated, and the constraints are specified.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise and quantitative (e.g., \"$300$ folia\", \"$15$ folia per week\", \"every fourth week\", \"one-third...is redirected\"). It is free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a self-contained, logically consistent, and well-posed mathematical problem. The solution process may proceed.\n\n**2. Solution Derivation**\n\nThe solution will be developed in two parts, corresponding to the two tasks in the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of $T_{\\min}$**\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum time, $T_{\\min}$, required to complete the reading under ideal, uninterrupted conditions. The fundamental relationship provided is that cumulative work is the product of rate and time.\n\nLet $W$ be the total work, which is the total number of folia to be read.\nLet $r_0$ be the unimpeded, or baseline, reading rate.\nLet $T_{\\min}$ be the time required.\n\nThe governing equation is:\n$$W = r_0 \\times T_{\\min}$$\n\nWe are given:\n- $W = 300$ folia\n- $r_0 = 15$ folia per week\n\nSolving for $T_{\\min}$:\n$$T_{\\min} = \\frac{W}{r_0}$$\n$$T_{\\min} = \\frac{300}{15} = 20 \\text{ weeks}$$\nThus, the minimum time to complete the *Articella* under ideal conditions is $20$ weeks.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Adjusted Rate $r$**\n\nThe second task requires finding a new reading rate, $r$, for non-disputation weeks that allows the student to complete the $300$ folia in the same total time, $T_{\\min} = 20$ weeks, while accounting for the disruption from disputations.\n\nThe total duration of study is $T = T_{\\min} = 20$ weeks.\nDisputations occur \"every fourth week.\" Over a period of $20$ weeks, this means disputations take place in week $4$, week $8$, week $12$, week $16$, and week $20$.\n\nLet $N_d$ be the number of disputation weeks and $N_{nd}$ be the number of non-disputation weeks within the total time $T$.\n$$N_d = \\lfloor \\frac{T}{4} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{20}{4} \\rfloor = 5 \\text{ weeks}$$\nThe number of non-disputation weeks is:\n$$N_{nd} = T - N_d = 20 - 5 = 15 \\text{ weeks}$$\n\nLet $r$ be the new, adjusted reading rate for non-disputation weeks (in folia per week).\nDuring a disputation week, one-third of the study time is lost. Therefore, the time available for reading is $1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$ of the normal time. Assuming the reading rate (folia per week) is directly proportional to the time spent reading, the rate during a disputation week, $r_d$, is:\n$$r_d = \\frac{2}{3} r$$\n\nThe total work, $W$, is the sum of the work completed during non-disputation weeks ($W_{nd}$) and the work completed during disputation weeks ($W_d$).\n$$W = W_{nd} + W_d$$\n$$W = (N_{nd} \\times r) + (N_d \\times r_d)$$\n\nWe are given $W=300$. Substituting the expressions for $N_{nd}$, $N_d$, and $r_d$:\n$$300 = (15 \\times r) + \\left(5 \\times \\frac{2}{3} r\\right)$$\n\nNow, we solve for $r$:\n$$300 = 15r + \\frac{10}{3}r$$\nTo combine the terms on the right side, we find a common denominator:\n$$300 = \\left(\\frac{15 \\times 3}{3}\\right)r + \\frac{10}{3}r$$\n$$300 = \\frac{45}{3}r + \\frac{10}{3}r$$\n$$300 = \\left(\\frac{45+10}{3}\\right)r$$\n$$300 = \\frac{55}{3}r$$\n\nIsolating $r$:\n$$r = \\frac{300 \\times 3}{55}$$\n$$r = \\frac{900}{55}$$\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $5$:\n$$r = \\frac{900 \\div 5}{55 \\div 5} = \\frac{180}{11}$$\n\nSo, the required reading rate for non-disputation weeks is $\\frac{180}{11}$ folia per week.\n\nThe final answer is the pair $(T_{\\min}, r)$, expressed as a row matrix.\n$T_{\\min} = 20$\n$r = \\frac{180}{11}$\n\nThe final answer is $\\begin{pmatrix} 20 & \\frac{180}{11} \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 20 & \\frac{180}{11} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4776693"}, {"introduction": "The culmination of a medieval medical education was the licensure examination—a high-stakes gateway to professional practice and its financial rewards.

A candidate for the medical license must pass three assessments on the first attempt in the following order: an oral disputation on Aristotelian logic as applied to medical questions, a commentary examination on Galenic and Hippocratic texts, and a supervised clinical practicum. Assume that these three examinations are taken in a single licensure sitting, that performance across them is independent, and that in the absence of remedial training the candidate’s probability of passing any single examination is $0.7$.\n\nUpon licensure, the candidate gains immediate permission to practice within the city for the current year and expects to earn $150$ florins in that year.

This is the cost at which the expected first-year net earnings with training equal those without training.\n\nLet's first determine the expected net earnings without training, denoted as $E_{nt}$. The earnings are a random variable, which takes the value $150$ florins upon successful licensure and $0$ otherwise. The cost in this scenario is $0$.
