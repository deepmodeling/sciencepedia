The famous maxim “first, do no harm” is widely attributed to the Hippocratic Oath, but is it actually there? This exercise challenges you to practice the core historical skill of source criticism by examining the relationship between the slogan and the Oath's actual text, encouraging you to analyze why such a phrase gained prominence centuries later [@problem_id:4770419].", "problem": "A central challenge in the history of medicine is distinguishing between the wording of early sources and later interpretations or slogans, and then explaining why and how those later formulations took root. Using the fundamental methods of historical source analysis—specifically, the distinction between primary and secondary sources, chronological dating, textual transmission, and reception history—evaluate the relationship between the Latin slogan “primum non nocere” (“first, do no harm”) and the Hippocratic Oath. Your task is to select the option that most accurately differentiates the later slogan from the actual content of the Hippocratic Oath and justifies the slogan’s appearance in the 19th century through historiographical reasoning grounded in verifiable premises: that the Hippocratic Oath originates in the 5th–4th century BCE Greek medical milieu, that the Hippocratic Corpus is a diverse set of texts rather than a single doctrine, that the Latin slogan as phrased is not present in the Oath, and that the 19th century witnessed therapeutic skepticism, statistical clinical methods, and professional codification of ethics (for example, Thomas Percival’s “Medical Ethics” and the American Medical Association (AMA) 1847 code). Choose the best justification among the following:\n\nA. “Primum non nocere” is not in the Hippocratic Oath; the Oath’s prescriptions and prohibitions concern pledges to teachers, comportment, avoidance of certain interventions (for example, refraining from surgery for bladder stones), refusal to administer lethal drugs, and maintaining confidentiality, framed in Greek ethical language. The Latin slogan crystallized in the 19th century amid growing concern about iatrogenic harm, therapeutic skepticism following critiques of bleeding and purging, the rise of numerical clinical methods, and the professional codification of medical ethics, which helped elevate a succinct nonmaleficence watchword into common parlance.\n\nB. “Primum non nocere” is the direct Latin translation found in Galen’s 2nd-century CE commentary on the Hippocratic Oath, and its presence in 19th-century medical literature reflects a simple revival of an ancient maxim without significant change in medical practice or professional norms.\n\nC. The slogan originates from medieval canon law and scholastic theology, which imposed nonmaleficence on physicians through ecclesiastical courts; hence, the Hippocratic Oath functions merely as a secular echo of the Church’s longstanding “first, do no harm” principle, later reasserted in 19th-century Europe without new scientific context.\n\nD. The phrase appears only in 20th-century bioethics as a response to World War II atrocities and state violence; the Hippocratic Oath itself originally centered patient autonomy under the rubric “do no harm,” making the modern slogan a direct recovery of the Oath’s primary ethical priority.\n\nE. The slogan is verbatim from Hippocrates’ Aphorisms, and its 19th-century popularity results only from standardized Latin translations, not from any substantive shifts in clinical method or professional identity.", "solution": "The problem statement is valid. It is scientifically and historically grounded, well-posed, objective, and provides a set of verifiable premises upon which to conduct the analysis. The task is to evaluate the relationship between the Latin slogan \"primum non nocere\" and the Hippocratic Oath using the methods of historical source analysis and the specific historical context provided for the 19th century.\n\nThe problem requires selecting the option that most accurately differentiates the slogan from the Oath's actual text and justifies the slogan's later prominence. The provided premises are:\n1. The Hippocratic Oath dates to the 5th–4th century BCE.\n2. The Hippocratic Corpus is a diverse collection of texts, not a single monolithic work.\n3. The specific phrase \"primum non nocere\" is not in the Hippocratic Oath.\n4. The 19th century was characterized by therapeutic skepticism, the rise of statistical clinical methods, and the codification of professional ethics (e.g., Thomas Percival, AMA code of 1847).\n\nBased on these premises, a rigorous evaluation of each option follows.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\n\nThis option posits that \"primum non nocere\" is not in the Hippocratic Oath and then accurately summarizes the Oath's actual content. It describes the Oath's main clauses: a covenant with teachers and their families, rules of professional conduct, a prohibition against specific surgical procedures (\"cutting for the stone,\" i.e., lithotomy), a refusal to provide lethal drugs (euthanasia) or abortifacients, and a duty of patient confidentiality. This description is factually correct and aligns with primary source analysis of the Oath itself.\n\nThe option then explains the slogan's crystallization in the 19th century. It links this development to specific historical phenomena given in the problem statement: \"growing concern about iatrogenic harm, therapeutic skepticism following critiques of bleeding and purging, the rise of numerical clinical methods, and the professional codification of medical ethics.\" This explanation is historically sound. The \"numerical method\" championed by Pierre-Charles Alexandre Louis in Paris in the 1830s used statistics to demonstrate the ineffectiveness and harm of heroic therapies like bloodletting. This engendered \"therapeutic skepticism,\" a professional climate where physicians became more aware of the potential for their interventions to cause harm (iatrogenesis). In this context, a simple, powerful maxim like \"first, do no harm\" serves as an essential principle of caution. Its rise also coincides with efforts to formalize medical ethics (Percival's 1803 *Medical Ethics*, the AMA's first code in 1847), which sought to establish a clear professional identity grounded in patient welfare.\n\nThis option successfully and accurately connects the slogan's popularization to the specific intellectual and professional currents of the 19th century, as stipulated by the problem's premises. The reasoning is consistent with the methods of reception history, explaining how and why a particular idea took root in a specific later context.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n\nThis option claims that \"`primum non nocere` is the direct Latin translation found in Galen’s 2nd-century CE commentary on the Hippocratic Oath.\" This is a significant factual error. Philological and historical scholarship has shown that this Latin phrase does not appear in Galen's works, nor in any other ancient source as such. A similar sentiment— \"As to diseases, make a habit of two things—to help, or at least to do no harm\" (in Greek: ἀσκέειν, περὶ τὰ νουσήματα, δύο, ὠφελέειν, ἢ μὴ βλάπτειν)—is found in the Hippocratic text *Epidemics*, Book 1, Section 11, but this is not the Oath, and it is not the Latin phrase in question. The claim of direct translation by Galen is false.\n\nFurthermore, the option claims the slogan's rise in the 19th century was a \"simple revival... without significant change in medical practice or professional norms.\" This directly contradicts the problem's premise that the 19th century witnessed profound changes, including therapeutic skepticism and codification of ethics. This part of the option is therefore historically and logically invalid within the context of the problem.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n\nThis option claims the slogan originates from \"medieval canon law and scholastic theology.\" This is an unsubstantiated historical claim regarding the specific phrase. While nonmaleficence is a general ethical principle, this specific Latin formulation is not traced to medieval canon law. More critically, the option states that the Hippocratic Oath \"functions merely as a secular echo of the Church’s longstanding... principle.\" This is a gross chronological error. The Hippocratic Oath (c. 5th–4th century BCE) predates Christianity and its ecclesiastical structures by several hundred years. The Oath cannot be an \"echo\" of something that did not yet exist.\n\nFinally, the claim that the principle was reasserted in the 19th century \"without new scientific context\" is a direct contradiction of the problem's explicit premises about the rise of statistical methods and therapeutic skepticism.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n\nThis option claims the phrase \"appears only in 20th-century bioethics as a response to World War II atrocities.\" This is factually incorrect. The phrase's rise to prominence is firmly situated in the 19th century. While the principle of nonmaleficence was a cornerstone of post-WWII medical ethics codes like the Nuremberg Code, the slogan itself was already well-established.\n\nThe option also asserts that \"the Hippocratic Oath itself originally centered patient autonomy under the rubric ‘do no harm.’\" This is a severe misreading of the Oath and an anachronism. The Oath is a model of medical paternalism, where the physician, bound by a sacred promise, makes decisions on behalf of the patient. The modern concept of patient autonomy as a central ethical pillar emerged much later, primarily in the latter half of the 20th century. Conflating nonmaleficence with autonomy is a conceptual error.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option E**\n\nThis option claims the slogan is \"verbatim from Hippocrates’ Aphorisms.\" This is factually incorrect. The phrase \"primum non nocere\" does not appear verbatim in the *Aphorisms* or any other work of the Hippocratic Corpus. As noted earlier, a thematically related phrase exists in *Epidemics*, but the claim of a verbatim source in the *Aphorisms* is false.\n\nThe second part of the option states that the slogan's 19th-century popularity results \"only from standardized Latin translations, not from any substantive shifts in clinical method or professional identity.\" This assertion explicitly rejects the explanatory framework provided in the problem statement. The problem directs the solver to use the \"substantive shifts\" of the 19th century (therapeutic skepticism, etc.) as the basis for the justification. This option denies their relevance, thereby failing to correctly address the prompt.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption A is the only choice that is factually accurate regarding the primary sources (the Hippocratic Oath and Corpus) and correctly applies the provided historical premises to construct a sound historiographical argument. It correctly distinguishes the Oath's content from the later slogan and provides the correct context for the slogan's emergence and popularization in the 19th century.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4770419"}, {"introduction": "How similar are the ethical codes of ancient Greece and ancient India?

The use of expected utility maximization is a cornerstone of rational choice theory.

The objective is to identify a specific decision-making model and its outcome, which is a solvable task.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, formal language. The use of numerical utilities is a standard method for modeling preferences and outcomes in a non-subjective manner within the confines of the model. It does not advocate for any particular ethical view but asks for the logical application of a specified hybrid model.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. The data are complete for the required calculations. The constraints are consistent; the description of the HO as a \"hard constraint\" that \"exclude[s]... actions\" is a clear directive for how to structure the decision process.\n- **No Other Flaws**: The problem is not unrealistic (it is a stylized model, which is appropriate), ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable. It presents a clear, non-trivial task of integrating a deontological rule with a consequentialist optimization procedure.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem that can be solved through logical deduction and calculation based on the provided information.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires a decision-making framework that integrates two components:\n1. A deontological constraint from the Hippocratic Oath (HO), which functions as a \"hard constraint\".\n2. A consequentialist calculation based on maximizing expected utility (EU) for all permissible actions.\n\nThe formula for expected utility is given as $EU = p_b B - p_h H$. We first calculate the EU for each of the four candidate actions.\n\n- **Action $\\mathcal{A}_1$**:\n$$EU(\\mathcal{A}_1) = (0.85)(14) - (0.30)(20) = 11.9 - 6.0 = 5.9$$\n\n- **Action $\\mathcal{A}_2$**:\n$$EU(\\mathcal{A}_2) = (0.99)(20) - (1.00)(7) = 19.8 - 7.0 = 12.8$$\n\n- **Action $\\mathcal{A}_3$**:\n$$EU(\\mathcal{A}_3) = (0.70)(16) - (0.10)(18) = 11.2 - 1.8 = 9.4$$\n\n- **Action $\\mathcal{A}_4$**:\n$$EU(\\mathcal{A}_4) = (0.20)(5) - (0.80)(12) = 1.0 - 9.6 = -8.6$$\n\nNext, we apply the specified decision framework. The HO prohibition is a \"hard constraint\" that \"exclude[s] certain actions from moral permissibility\". This means any prohibited action must be removed from the set of possible choices *before* the EU maximization step.\n\nThe initial set of actions is $\\{\\mathcal{A}_1, \\mathcal{A}_2, \\mathcal{A}_3, \\mathcal{A}_4\\}$.\nThe problem explicitly states that $\\mathcal{A}_2$ is prohibited by the HO. Therefore, $\\mathcal{A}_2$ is removed from consideration.\nThe resulting set of admissible actions is $\\{\\mathcal{A}_1, \\mathcal{A}_3, \\mathcal{A}_4\\}$.\n\nThe final step is to apply the EU maximization principle to this admissible set. We compare the EU values for the remaining actions:\n- $EU(\\mathcal{A}_1) = 5.9$\n- $EU(\\mathcal{A}_3) = 9.4$\n- $EU(\\mathcal{A}_4) = -8.6$\n\nThe maximum expected utility among the admissible actions is $9.4$, which corresponds to action $\\mathcal{A}_3$.\n\nTherefore, the correct framework involves first filtering the options based on the hard deontological constraint and then selecting the option with the highest EU from the remaining set. The chosen action is $\\mathcal{A}_3$.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Maximize expected utility over all listed actions without excluding any; choose $\\mathcal{A}_2$ because it has the largest expected net value.**\nThis option describes a purely consequentialist (utilitarian) approach. It correctly identifies that $\\mathcal{A}_2$ has the highest EU overall ($12.8$). However, it completely ignores the problem's explicit requirement to treat the HO prohibition as a \"hard constraint\". By including the prohibited action $\\mathcal{A}_2$ in the final choice-set, this framework violates a core premise of the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Treat HO prohibitions as hard constraints that exclude any barred action from the feasible set; then maximize expected utility over the remaining admissible actions; choose $\\mathcal{A}_3$.**\nThis option perfectly describes the two-step procedure derived above. It first treats the HO prohibition as a filter, excluding the barred action $\\mathcal{A}_2$. This creates an admissible set of $\\{\\mathcal{A}_1, \\mathcal{A}_3, \\mathcal{A}_4\\}$. It then correctly identifies that maximizing EU over this set leads to the choice of $\\mathcal{A}_3$ (since $9.4 > 5.9 > -8.6$). This framework and its resulting choice are fully consistent with the problem statement.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Encode the HO as a large but finite penalty subtracted from expected utility whenever an action violates a prohibition, and pick the action with the largest penalized expected utility; choose $\\mathcal{A}_1$.**\nThis option proposes an alternative modeling technique where a deontological rule is converted into a large negative utility (a \"soft constraint\"). This is fundamentally different from a \"hard constraint\" that makes an action impermissible regardless of consequences. Furthermore, even within this flawed framework, the conclusion is incorrect. To choose $\\mathcal{A}_1$, its utility ($5.9$) would have to be the highest. But the utility of $\\mathcal{A}_3$ is $9.4$, so $\\mathcal{A}_3$ would be chosen over $\\mathcal{A}_1$ (assuming the penalty for $\\mathcal{A}_2$ is large enough to make its penalized EU less than $9.4$). The choice of $\\mathcal{A}_1$ is not justified.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Apply a zero-risk principle derived from “do no harm”: reject any action with nonzero $p_h$ and select the remaining action; choose $\\mathcal{A}_4$.**\nThis option proposes a \"zero-risk\" or \"precautionary\" principle, which is a different decision rule altogether and not an EU-based framework as requested. It also misinterprets \"do no harm\". Applying this rule, actions $\\mathcal{A}_1$ ($p_h = 0.30$), $\\mathcal{A}_2$ ($p_h = 1.00$), $\\mathcal{A}_3$ ($p_h = 0.10$), and $\\mathcal{A}_4$ ($p_h = 0.80$) would all be rejected because they all have a non-zero probability of harm. Thus, no action could be chosen. The claim that $\\mathcal{A}_4$ would be selected is internally contradictory.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4770438"}]}
