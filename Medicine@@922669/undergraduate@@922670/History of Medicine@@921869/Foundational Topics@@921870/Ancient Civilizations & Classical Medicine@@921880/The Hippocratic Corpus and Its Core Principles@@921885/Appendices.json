Round your answer to four significant figures and express it as a decimal (do not use a percentage sign).\n\nIn one sentence, interpret how this posterior compares to a prudential “grave prognosis” threshold derived from Hippocratic practice understood as warning when the risk is high enough to responsibly prepare kin and resources (you may take a notional threshold of $0.60$ as a reference point for such a warning). Your final reported answer must be only the numerical posterior probability rounded as specified.", "solution": "The problem will first be validated for scientific and logical integrity before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient dies, and $D^c$ be the event that the patient survives. Let $S_1$, $S_2$, and $S_3$ be the events that the patient exhibits the \"Hippocratic face\", cold/clammy extremities, and muttering delirium, respectively.\n\nThe verbatim givens are:\n- Background mortality risk (prior probability of death): $P(D) = 0.25$.\n- Conditional probability of the Hippocratic face: $P(S_{1} \\mid D) = 0.70$ and $P(S_{1} \\mid D^c) = 0.15$.\n- Conditional probability of cold, clammy extremities: $P(S_{2} \\mid D) = 0.60$ and $P(S_{2} \\mid D^c) = 0.20$.\n- Conditional probability of muttering delirium: $P(S_{3} \\mid D) = 0.50$ and $P(S_{3} \\mid D^c) = 0.10$.\n- Assumption: The signs $S_1$, $S_2$, and $S_3$ are conditionally independent given the patient's outcome ($D$ or $D^c$).\n- The goal is to compute the posterior probability $P(D \\mid S_{1}, S_{2}, S_{3})$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is a standard exercise in Bayesian probability theory, framed within a historical context.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is an application of established mathematical principles (Bayes' theorem, law of total probability). The historical framing is a narrative device, but the underlying probabilistic model is sound. The provided probabilities are hypothetical but lie within the valid range of $[0, 1]$ and are internally consistent.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data (prior probabilities and conditional probabilities) and a crucial assumption (conditional independence) required to calculate a unique posterior probability.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to compute the posterior probability of death given the simultaneous observation of all three signs, $P(D \\mid S_1, S_2, S_3)$. We will use Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$ P(D \\mid S_1, S_2, S_3) = \\frac{P(S_1, S_2, S_3 \\mid D) P(D)}{P(S_1, S_2, S_3)} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the terms in the numerator.\nThe prior probability of death is given as $P(D) = 0.25$.\nThe likelihood of observing all three signs given death is $P(S_1, S_2, S_3 \\mid D)$. Due to the assumption of conditional independence, this can be expressed as the product of the individual conditional probabilities:\n$$ P(S_1, S_2, S_3 \\mid D) = P(S_1 \\mid D) P(S_2 \\mid D) P(S_3 \\mid D) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ P(S_1, S_2, S_3 \\mid D) = (0.70)(0.60)(0.50) = 0.21 $$\nThe numerator of Bayes' theorem is therefore:\n$$ P(S_1, S_2, S_3 \\mid D) P(D) = 0.21 \\times 0.25 = 0.0525 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator, $P(S_1, S_2, S_3)$, which is the total probability of observing the three signs, regardless of the outcome. We use the law of total probability, partitioning the outcome space into death ($D$) and survival ($D^c$):\n$$ P(S_1, S_2, S_3) = P(S_1, S_2, S_3 \\mid D) P(D) + P(S_1, S_2, S_3 \\mid D^c) P(D^c) $$\nWe have already calculated the first term in this sum. We now calculate the second term.\nThe prior probability of survival is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\nThe likelihood of observing the three signs given survival, $P(S_1, S_2, S_3 \\mid D^c)$, is calculated using the conditional independence assumption:\n$$ P(S_1, S_2, S_3 \\mid D^c) = P(S_1 \\mid D^c) P(S_2 \\mid D^c) P(S_3 \\mid D^c) $$\nSubstituting the given values for the survival outcome:\n$$ P(S_1, S_2, S_3 \\mid D^c) = (0.15)(0.20)(0.10) = 0.003 $$\nNow, we can compute the total probability $P(S_1, S_2, S_3)$:\n$$ P(S_1, S_2, S_3) = (0.21)(0.25) + (0.003)(0.75) $$\n$$ P(S_1, S_2, S_3) = 0.0525 + 0.00225 = 0.05475 $$\n\nFinally, we substitute the numerator and denominator back into Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:\n$$ P(D \\mid S_1, S_2, S_3) = \\frac{0.0525}{0.05475} $$\nTo find the numerical value, we perform the division:\n$$ P(D \\mid S_1, S_2, S_3) \\approx 0.958904109... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ P(D \\mid S_1, S_2, S_3) \\approx 0.9589 $$\n\nIn response to the interpretative query, the calculated posterior probability of death, approximately $0.9589$, is substantially greater than the posited grave prognosis threshold of $0.60$, thus strongly warranting a warning to the patient's kin and preparations for a likely fatal outcome. The combination of these three signs has dramatically shifted the initial probability of death from $0.25$ to nearly certain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9589}$$", "id": "4770126"}]}
