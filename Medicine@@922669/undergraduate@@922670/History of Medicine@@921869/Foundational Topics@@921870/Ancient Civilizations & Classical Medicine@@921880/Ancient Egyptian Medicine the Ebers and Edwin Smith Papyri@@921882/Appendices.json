Consider a recipe in the Ebers Papyrus for a castor oil emulsion in which a scribal term is recorded as $n$ units of an ingredient.

We will proceed with a solution derived from fundamental principles.\n\nLet us define the relevant events:\n- $P$: The event that an individual is pregnant.\n- $P^c$: The event that an individual is not pregnant.\n- $T^+$: The event that the test result is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the test result is negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following information, which we translate into the language of probability theory:\n1.  The sensitivity of the test is $70\\%$. This is the conditional probability of a positive test result given that the individual is pregnant.\n    $$P(T^+ | P) = 0.70$$\n2.  The specificity of the test is $85\\%$. This is the conditional probability of a negative test result given that the individual is not pregnant.\n    $$P(T^- | P^c) = 0.85$$\n3.  The prior probability of pregnancy is estimated to be $0.5$.\n    $$P(P) = 0.5$$\n\nFrom the prior probability of pregnancy, the prior probability of not being pregnant is its complement:\n$$P(P^c) = 1 - P(P) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$$\n\nThe objective is to determine the posterior probability of pregnancy given a positive test outcome. This corresponds to the conditional probability $P(P | T^+)$.\n\nAccording to the fundamental definition of conditional probability, we have:\n$$P(P | T^+) = \\frac{P(P \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\nTo solve for $P(P | T^+)$, we must calculate the numerator, $P(P \\cap T^+)$, and the denominator, $P(T^+)$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator, which is the joint probability of being pregnant and testing positive. We can rearrange the definition of conditional probability, $P(T^+ | P) = \\frac{P(P \\cap T^+)}{P(P)}$, to solve for the joint probability:\n$$P(P \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | P) \\times P(P)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(P \\cap T^+) = 0.70 \\times 0.5 = 0.35$$\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator, $P(T^+)$, which is the total probability of a positive test. A positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios: (1) the individual is pregnant and tests positive ($P \\cap T^+$), or (2) the individual is not pregnant and tests positive ($P^c \\cap T^+$). Using the law of total probability, we can express $P(T^+)$ as the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios:\n$$P(T^+) = P(P \\cap T^+) + P(P^c \\cap T^+)$$\n\nWe have already computed the first term, $P(P \\cap T^+) = 0.35$. We now compute the second term, $P(P^c \\cap T^+)$. Similar to the calculation for the numerator, we use the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(P^c \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | P^c) \\times P(P^c)$$\nWe know $P(P^c)=0.5$, but we are not directly given $P(T^+ | P^c)$, which is the probability of a positive test given the individual is not pregnant (the false positive rate). However, we are given the specificity, $P(T^- | P^c) = 0.85$. For a non-pregnant individual, the test can only be positive or negative. Therefore, these two outcomes are complementary events:\n$$P(T^+ | P^c) + P(T^- | P^c) = 1$$\nSolving for $P(T^+ | P^c)$:\n$$P(T^+ | P^c) = 1 - P(T^- | P^c) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$$\nNow we can calculate $P(P^c \\cap T^+)$:\n$$P(P^c \\cap T^+) = 0.15 \\times 0.5 = 0.075$$\n\nWith both terms, we can find the total probability of a positive test:\n$$P(T^+) = P(P \\cap T^+) + P(P^c \\cap T^+) = 0.35 + 0.075 = 0.425$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the values for the numerator and the denominator back into the expression for our desired posterior probability, $P(P | T^+)$:\n$$P(P | T^+) = \\frac{P(P \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{0.35}{0.425}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$P(P | T^+) = \\frac{350}{425} = \\frac{14 \\times 25}{17 \\times 25} = \\frac{14}{17} \\approx 0.8235294...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem consists of two independent tasks: calculating the total volume of the salve and determining its maximum storage time based on a potency threshold.\n\n**1. Calculation of Total Volume ($V$)**\n\nThe total volume $V$ required is the product of the number of applications and the volume used per application.\n\nGiven:\n- Number of applications, $n = 10$.\n- Volume per application, $v = 10$ mL.\n\nThe total volume $V$ is:\n$$V = n \\times v$$\n$$V = 10 \\times 10 \\, \\text{mL} = 100 \\, \\text{mL}$$\n\n**2. Calculation of Maximum Storage Time ($t$)**\n\nThe calculation of the maximum storage time $t$ requires a multi-step application of kinetic principles.\n\n**a. First-Order Kinetics Model**\n\nThe potency of the salve, let's denote it by $P(t)$, decreases over time following first-order kinetics. The equation is:\n$$P(t) = P_0 \\exp(-kt)$$\nwhere $P_0$ is the initial potency at $t=0$, and $k$ is the first-order rate constant at the storage temperature.\n\nThe problem states that the salve is acceptable as long as its potency is at least $0.9$ of its initial value. The maximum storage time $t$ is reached when the potency drops to exactly this threshold:\n$$P(t) = 0.9 P_0$$\nSubstituting this into the decay equation:\n$$0.9 P_0 = P_0 \\exp(-kt)$$\nDividing by $P_0$ (which is non-zero):\n$$0.9 = \\exp(-kt)$$\nTo solve for $t$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln(0.9) = -kt$$\n$$t = -\\frac{\\ln(0.9)}{k} = \\frac{\\ln(1/0.9)}{k}$$\n\n**b. Determine the Rate Constant ($k$) at $30\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$**\n\nThe rate constant $k$ is temperature-dependent. We are given the half-life at $20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and a $Q_{10}$ value to find the rate constant at the storage temperature of $30\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nFirst, we find the rate constant at $20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, denoted $k_{20}$, from the given half-life, $t_{1/2, 20} = 60$ days. The relationship between half-life and the rate constant for a first-order reaction is:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}$$\nTherefore, the rate constant at $20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ is:\n$$k_{20} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2, 20}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{60 \\, \\text{days}}$$\n\nNext, we use the $Q_{10}$ temperature coefficient to find the rate constant at $30\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, denoted $k_{30}$. The $Q_{10}$ value is the factor by which the rate constant increases for a $10\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ temperature rise. It is defined as:\n$$Q_{10} = \\frac{k_{T+10}}{k_T}$$\nIn this case, $T = 20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, $T+10 = 30\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, and $Q_{10} = 2.0$.\n$$k_{30} = Q_{10} \\times k_{20}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$k_{30} = 2.0 \\times \\frac{\\ln(2)}{60 \\, \\text{days}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{30 \\, \\text{days}}$$\nThis is the rate constant $k$ to be used in the storage time calculation, as the ambient storage temperature is $30\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\n**c. Final Calculation of $t$**\n\nNow we substitute the expression for $k = k_{30}$ into the equation for $t$:\n$$t = \\frac{\\ln(1/0.9)}{k_{30}} = \\frac{\\ln(1/0.9)}{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{30 \\, \\text{days}}}$$\n$$t = 30 \\frac{\\ln(1/0.9)}{\\ln(2)} \\, \\text{days}$$\nWe can now compute the numerical value:\n$$t = 30 \\frac{\\ln(10/9)}{\\ln(2)} \\, \\text{days}$$\n$$t \\approx 30 \\frac{0.1053605}{0.693147} \\, \\text{days}$$\n$$t \\approx 30 \\times 0.151993 \\, \\text{days}$$\n$$t \\approx 4.5598 \\, \\text{days}$$\nThe problem requires rounding the result for $t$ to three significant figures.\n$$t \\approx 4.56 \\, \\text{days}$$\n\nThe two final results are $V=100$ mL and $t=4.56$ days.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 100 & 4.56 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4737472"}]}
