Modern analysis connects this efficacy to the glycoside salicin, which can yield the pharmacologically active salicylic acid under hydrolysis and subsequent oxidation. Consider a historically plausible decoction scenario: dried willow bark contains a mean salicin mass fraction $f_{s} = 0.0125$; the simmering extraction brings a fraction $E = 0.60$ of the bark’s salicin into the water; and the fraction that is ultimately converted to salicylic acid (that is, the overall hydrolysis plus oxidation yield relevant to “salicylic equivalent”) is $F_{\\text{conv}} = 0.90$.
