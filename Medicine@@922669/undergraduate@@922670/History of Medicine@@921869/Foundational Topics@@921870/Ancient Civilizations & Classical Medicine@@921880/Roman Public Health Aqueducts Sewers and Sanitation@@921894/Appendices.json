The EPA's action level for lead in drinking water is $15~\\mu\\mathrm{g/L}$. The concentration in the Roman water ($5~\\mu\\mathrm{g/L}$) is below this regulatory threshold. An action level is not a demarcation of safety but a trigger for corrective action by the water utility.\n$2$. The EPA's Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG) for lead is $0~\\mu\\mathrm{g/L}$. The concentration in the Roman water ($5~\\mu\\mathrm{g/L}$) is substantially higher than this health goal. The MCLG represents the level of a contaminant in drinking water below which there is no known or expected risk to health.\nThe discrepancy between the action level and the MCLG is rooted in the current scientific and medical consensus that there is no safe level of chronic lead exposure. Lead is a cumulative toxicant, and any intake contributes to the total body burden, posing health risks, especially neurotoxic effects in developing fetuses and children. Therefore, from a modern public health standpoint, even though the concentration of $5~\\mu\\mathrm{g/L}$ is below the EPA's action level, it would be considered an unacceptable long-term health risk, affirming the rationale behind an MCLG of zero.
