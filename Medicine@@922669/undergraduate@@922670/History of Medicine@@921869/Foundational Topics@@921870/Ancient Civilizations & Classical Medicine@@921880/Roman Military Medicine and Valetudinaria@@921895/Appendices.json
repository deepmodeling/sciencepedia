Treat the remaining non-corridor area as entirely assignable ward area (i.e., do not reserve additional space for service rooms). Using the fundamental definition that the area of a rectangle is $A = l \\times w$, and the capacity requirement that the minimum floor area per bed is $4$ $\\text{m}^{2}$, with $8$ beds per ward, derive from first principles the ratio $R$ of available ward area per ward to the minimum required bed area per ward.

All data required for a unique solution are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or scientifically unsound premises.\n\nThe objective is to derive the ratio $R$ of the available ward area per ward to the minimum required bed area per ward and to assess the sufficiency of the space. We will proceed by calculating these two areas from the given parameters.\n\nLet the side length of the square footprint be $s$. The total area of the footprint, $A_{total}$, is given by the area formula for a square:\n$$A_{total} = s^2$$\nGiven $s = 60~\\text{m}$, the total area is:\n$$A_{total} = (60~\\text{m})^2 = 3600~\\text{m}^2$$\n\nA fraction $f_c$ of the total footprint is occupied by corridors.

The area occupied by corridors, $A_c$, is:\n$$A_c = f_c \\times A_{total} = 0.25 \\times 3600~\\text{m}^2 = 900~\\text{m}^2$$\n\nThe problem states that the remaining non-corridor area is entirely assignable to wards. Let this total ward area be $A_{w,total}$.\n$$A_{w,total} = A_{total} - A_c = A_{total}(1 - f_c)$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$A_{w,total} = 3600~\\text{m}^2 - 900~\\text{m}^2 = 2700~\\text{m}^2$$\n\nThere are $N_w = 24$ equal wards. The available area per ward, $A_{ward,avail}$, is the total ward area divided by the number of wards:\n$$A_{ward,avail} = \\frac{A_{w,total}}{N_w}$$\n$$A_{ward,avail} = \\frac{2700~\\text{m}^2}{24} = 112.5~\\text{m}^2$$\n\nNext, we calculate the minimum required area per ward. The problem specifies a requirement of $N_{beds} = 8$ beds per ward, with a minimum floor area per bed of $A_{bed,min} = 4~\\text{m}^2$. The minimum required bed area per ward, $A_{ward,req}$, is:\n$$A_{ward,req} = N_{beds} \\times A_{bed,min}$$\n$$A_{ward,req} = 8 \\times 4~\\text{m}^2 = 32~\\text{m}^2$$\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $R$ of the available ward area to the minimum required bed area per ward.\n$$R = \\frac{A_{ward,avail}}{A_{ward,req}}$$\nWe can express this ratio symbolically in terms of the primary givens:\n$$R = \\frac{\\frac{A_{total}(1 - f_c)}{N_w}}{N_{beds} \\times A_{bed,min}} = \\frac{s^2(1 - f_c)}{N_w N_{beds} A_{bed,min}}$$\n\nSubstituting the numerical values into the expression for $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{112.5~\\text{m}^2}{32~\\text{m}^2} = \\frac{112.5}{32}$$\nThe calculation yields an exact value:\n$$R = 3.515625$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$R \\approx 3.516$$\n\nFinally, we must argue whether the hypothesized ward area is sufficient. A ratio $R \\ge 1$ indicates that the available area is greater than or equal to the required area, meaning it is sufficient. In this case, $R \\approx 3.516$, which is significantly greater than $1$. This means the available area per ward ($112.5~\\text{m}^2$) is more than $3.5$ times the minimum area required to house $8$ beds ($32~\\text{m}^2$).

For planning purposes, the hospital administrator consults a daily census that records the number of inpatients currently admitted and the occupancy level.

The underlying mathematical principles are sound. The historical details are plausible for a word problem and do not introduce any scientific contradictions.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all the necessary data ($N=96$, staffing ratios, rounding rule) to determine the number of *medici* and *capsarii*. The solution is unique and meaningful.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in clear, objective language with well-defined terms and rules.\n-   **Conclusion:** The problem is free of scientific unsoundness, ambiguity, and contradiction. The information regarding the legion's total size ($5{,}000$) and the occupancy ($80\\%$) is extraneous to the calculation of staff needed for the current census of $N=96$, but it does not create a contradiction. Using this data, one can calculate the total bed capacity $C = \\frac{N}{o} = \\frac{96}{0.80} = 120$, which is a consistent value. The problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to determine the minimum number of *medici* ($M$) and *capsarii* ($K$) required to supervise the current inpatient census.\n\nThe givens for the calculation are:\n1.  The number of inpatients, $N = 96$.\n2.  The maximum number of inpatients a single *medicus* can supervise is $12$.\n3.  The number of *capsarii* supporting each *medicus* is exactly $2$.\n4.  Any fractional number of staff must be rounded up to the next integer. This is mathematically equivalent to applying the ceiling function, denoted as $\\lceil x \\rceil$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of *medici*, $M$. The number of *medici* required is determined by the total number of inpatients, $N$, and the supervisory capacity of each *medicus*.\n\n$M_{\\text{required}} = \\frac{\\text{Total inpatients}}{\\text{Inpatients per medicus}} = \\frac{N}{12}$\n\nSubstituting the given value for $N$:\n$M_{\\text{required}} = \\frac{96}{12} = 8$\n\nThe problem states that fractional requirements must be rounded up. In this case, the result is an exact integer, $8$. Applying the ceiling function does not change the value:\n$M = \\lceil \\frac{96}{12} \\rceil = \\lceil 8 \\rceil = 8$\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of *medici* required is $8$.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of *capsarii*, $K$. The problem states that each *medicus* is supported by exactly two *capsarii*. The number of *capsarii* is therefore directly proportional to the number of *medici*.\n\n$K = 2 \\times M$\n\nUsing the calculated value $M=8$:\n$K = 2 \\times 8 = 16$\n\nSince $M$ is an integer, $K$ is also an integer, and no further rounding is necessary. The minimum number of *capsarii* required is $16$.\n\nThe problem asks for the result as an ordered pair $(M, K)$.\n$(M, K) = (8, 16)$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(8, 16)}$$", "id": "4761869"}, {"introduction": "An effective medical system relies on more than just space and staff; it requires sound policies that govern its operation and address complex human factors. This final practice moves from quantitative calculation to qualitative systems thinking, tackling the perennial challenge of malingering within a high-discipline military environment. By reasoning from a set of historically plausible principles, you are challenged to design an administrative policy that balances compassionate care, medical integrity, and military readiness, highlighting the crucial role of governance in the history of medicine [@problem_id:4761901].", "problem": "A Roman legionary camp has established a valetudinarium (military hospital) staffed by trained *medici* and assistants.

You are asked to recommend a policy that manages this tension.\n\nUse only the following base facts to reason from first principles:\n- Roman military culture prioritizes *disciplina* and unit cohesion; punishments for deception were severe, but justice and proportionality were valued to maintain morale and legitimacy.\n- *Valetudinaria* were designed for observation, isolation, and treatment under the authority of medical personnel, whose decisions ideally should be insulated from direct command pressure to preserve clinical judgment.\n- Roman medicine, while framed by humoral theory, relied heavily on careful observation of signs such as fever, pulse, wounds, stool, sleep patterns, appetite, and functional capacity; extended observation was a common tool to distinguish acute from feigned illness.\n- Roman administration favored records, seals, and audits to maintain accountability across ranks, and it recognized graded duties for convalescents to match capability.\n- Incentives shape behavior: both soldiers and physicians may face pressures that can distort reporting and care if unchecked.\n\nWhich policy best balances strict discipline with compassionate care while minimizing abuse by suspected malingerers?\n\nA. Require that medical admission be based on examination by a medicus with a structured checklist of observable signs and functional tests, allow an independent second opinion for ambiguous cases, and permit short observation in the valetudinarium when diagnosis is uncertain. Separate medical decision-making from the chain of command, but require standardized, sealed sick certificates and ward logs subject to periodic audits by non-clinical administrators. Assign graded convalescent duties consistent with the medicus’s assessment to prevent total disengagement from service, and impose proportionate penalties for proven malingering after a formal review that includes medical testimony. Rotate medical staff across units to reduce collusion risks.\n\nB. Place full authority in the centurion to decide who is sick based on field appearance, instruct medici to implement his decisions without delay, and impose immediate corporal punishment when malingering is suspected to deter copycats. Discharge chronically ill soldiers quickly to avoid hospital crowding and forbid extended observation stays as wasteful.\n\nC. Accept all self-reported illnesses without challenge to preserve compassion, forbid physicians from questioning soldier accounts to avoid intimidation, grant full rations and relief from all duties for any reported ailment, and eliminate formal recordkeeping to reduce administrative burden. Promise amnesty for any soldier later found to have exaggerated symptoms to encourage openness.\n\nD. Use invasive trials such as routine bleeding and purging as a diagnostic test of sincerity, assuming that only truly ill soldiers will tolerate the intervention. Restrict hospital admission to those with obvious high fevers, and pay informers within the ranks for tips about malingerers to keep physicians vigilant. Allow commanders to overturn medical decisions when unit strength falls below target.\n\nE. Submit suspected cases to divinatory rituals to detect deceit, require solemn oaths as the primary diagnostic tool, and threaten physicians with severe punishment if a single malingerer is admitted.

Roman military culture prioritizes *disciplina* and unit cohesion; punishments for deception were severe, but justice and proportionality were valued to maintain morale and legitimacy.\n2.  *Valetudinaria* were designed for observation, isolation, and treatment under the authority of medical personnel (*medici*), whose decisions ideally should be insulated from direct command pressure to preserve clinical judgment.\n3.  Roman medicine relied heavily on careful observation of signs (fever, pulse, wounds, etc.) and functional capacity; extended observation was a common tool to distinguish acute from feigned illness.\n4.  Roman administration favored records, seals, and audits to maintain accountability, and it recognized graded duties for convalescents.\n5.  Incentives shape behavior: both soldiers and physicians may face pressures that can distort reporting and care if unchecked.\n\nThe goal is to select the policy that best balances these principles to manage suspected malingering while ensuring care for the legitimately ill.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem is structured as a logical deduction exercise. It presents a set of axioms (the base facts) and asks for the conclusion (the best policy) that follows from them.\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** While the topic is historical, the problem structure is one of systems analysis, grounded in logic. The base facts, treated as axioms for this problem, are historically plausible and do not violate any fundamental principles of logic or reasoning.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It requires an optimization of several competing factors (discipline, care, accountability, medical autonomy). Given the discrete options, a \"best\" solution can be identified as the one that most completely and consistently satisfies the given axioms.\n-   **Objective:** The language is objective and presents a clear set of constraints and goals.\n\nThe problem exhibits none of the invalidating flaws. It is a self-contained, consistent, and formalizable logic problem.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with deriving a solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Optimal Policy from First Principles\n\nAn optimal policy must be a system that integrates and balances all $5$ stated base facts.\n-   From Fact $1$, the policy must have a mechanism to punish proven malingering, but this process must be formal (\"justice\") and the punishment measured (\"proportionality\"). It cannot be arbitrary or based on mere suspicion.\n-   From Fact $2$, the authority to make medical diagnoses and prescribe treatment must rest with the *medici*, not the military line command. This protects clinical judgment.\n-   From Fact $3$, the diagnostic process itself must be based on observation of physical signs and functional capacity. For uncertain cases, the policy must allow for extended observation.\n-   From Fact $4$, the system requires robust administrative procedures, including formal records and audits, to ensure accountability. It also must include the option of \"graded duties\" for soldiers who are recovering, preventing them from being completely idle.\n-   From Fact $5$, the policy must include checks and balances to mitigate perverse incentives for all parties involved. Audits (from Fact $4$) are one such check.\n\nSynthesizing these points, the ideal policy would be a multi-stage process:\n$1$. Initial examination by a *medicus* based on a standardized set of observable evidence.\n$2$. Admission for a period of observation if the diagnosis is uncertain.\n$3$. A final medical decision made by the *medicus*, insulated from command influence.\n$4$. Assignment of graded duties appropriate to the soldier's condition.\n$5$. A formal, evidence-based review process for suspected malingering, leading to proportionate punishment only upon being proven guilty.\n$6$. An administrative layer of record-keeping and audits to ensure the integrity of the entire system and address potential distortions from incentives.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**Option A:** This option proposes:\n-   Examination by a *medicus* with a structured checklist and functional tests (implements Fact $3$).\n-   An independent second opinion and short observation for uncertain cases (implements Fact $3$ and strengthens Fact $2$).\n-   Separation of medical decision-making from the chain of command (implements Fact $2$).\n-   Standardized, sealed certificates and logs subject to audits (implements Fact $4$).\n-   Graded convalescent duties (implements Fact $4$).\n-   Proportionate penalties after a formal review with medical testimony (implements Fact $1$).\n-   Rotation of medical staff to reduce collusion (addresses incentives in Fact $5$).\nThis policy is a comprehensive system that directly maps to and integrates all $5$ base facts. It correctly balances *disciplina* with care, autonomy with accountability, and observation with action.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Option B:** This option proposes:\n-   Placing full diagnostic authority in the centurion (violates Fact $2$).\n-   Immediate corporal punishment on suspicion (violates the \"justice and proportionality\" aspect of Fact $1$ and ignores the diagnostic value of observation from Fact $3$).\n-   Forbidding extended observation (directly violates Fact $3$).\nThis policy elevates *disciplina* to an extreme, arbitrary level while dismantling the structure of rational medical care and autonomy.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**Option C:** This option proposes:\n-   Accepting all self-reported illness without challenge (violates the need for *disciplina* in Fact $1$ and observational diagnosis in Fact $3$).\n-   Forbidding physicians from questioning accounts (violates the core of medical practice described in Fact $3$).\n-   Eliminating formal recordkeeping (directly violates Fact $4$).\n-   Granting amnesty for proven exaggeration (directly violates Fact $1$).\nThis policy completely abandons *disciplina* and accountability, creating a system ripe for abuse.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**Option D:** This option proposes:\n-   Using invasive trials as a sincerity test (replaces the \"careful observation\" of Fact $3$ with a crude, punitive measure).\n-   Allowing commanders to overturn medical decisions (violates Fact $2$).\n-   Paying informers (likely to undermine \"unit cohesion,\" a key component of Fact $1$).\nThis policy is punitive, unscientific by the problem's own standards, and undermines both medical autonomy and military morale.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**Option E:** This option proposes:\n-   Using divinatory rituals and oaths for diagnosis (replaces the empirical method of Fact $3$ with superstition).\n-   Threatening physicians for admitting a single malingerer (creates a perverse incentive described in Fact $5$ that would lead to denying care to the sick, undermining the entire purpose of the *valetudinarium*).\n-   Mandating either full duty or full hospital admission (directly violates the principle of \"graded duties\" in Fact $4$).\nThis policy is irrational and counter-productive, contradicting multiple base facts.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option $A$ is the only policy that correctly synthesizes all the required principles laid out in the problem statement into a coherent and balanced system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4761901"}]}
