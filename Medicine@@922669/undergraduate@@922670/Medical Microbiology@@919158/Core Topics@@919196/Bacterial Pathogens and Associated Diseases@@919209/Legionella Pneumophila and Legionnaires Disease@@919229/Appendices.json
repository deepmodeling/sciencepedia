This first exercise explores the critical initial step of infection: calculating the effective infectious dose that reaches the deep lung. By considering factors like the alveolar deposition fraction and the viability of the bacteria, you will learn to distinguish between the total inhaled dose and the actual number of viable organisms capable of initiating disease, a fundamental concept in quantitative microbial risk assessment [@problem_id:4644964].", "problem": "A well-characterized aerosol exposure event involves inhalation of droplets containing Legionella pneumophila. A subject inhales an estimated dose of $2 \\times 10^{3}$ colony-forming units (CFU). Based on particle size distribution measurements and standard respiratory deposition models, $0.25$ of inhaled particles of this size reach the alveoli (alveolar deposition fraction). Due to environmental stressors and time in transit, only $0.60$ of deposited bacteria remain viable upon arrival in the alveolar space (viability fraction). Using the definitions that the deposition fraction is the fraction of the inhaled dose that reaches the alveoli and that the viability fraction is the fraction of deposited bacteria that are capable of forming colonies, compute the number of viable Legionella pneumophila CFU deposited in the alveoli. Then, using well-tested facts that Legionella pneumophila replicates within alveolar macrophages and that infectious dose is host- and context-dependent with no single fixed threshold, briefly reason whether the resulting alveolar viable dose is plausibly sufficient to pose an infection risk in a susceptible host. Express the final count in CFU and round your answer to $2$ significant figures.", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent.\n\nThe task is to compute the number of viable *Legionella pneumophila* colony-forming units (CFU) deposited in the alveoli and to then assess the plausible infection risk associated with this dose.\n\nFirst, we define the variables based on the information provided in the problem statement.\nLet $D_{inhaled}$ be the inhaled dose of bacteria.\n$$D_{inhaled} = 2 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ CFU}$$\nLet $f_{dep}$ be the alveolar deposition fraction, which is the fraction of the inhaled dose that reaches the alveoli.\n$$f_{dep} = 0.25$$\nLet $f_{via}$ be the viability fraction, which is the fraction of deposited bacteria that remain viable.\n$$f_{via} = 0.60$$\n\nThe number of CFU deposited in the alveoli, which we will denote as $D_{dep}$, is calculated by multiplying the inhaled dose by the alveolar deposition fraction.\n$$D_{dep} = D_{inhaled} \\times f_{dep}$$\nThe number of viable CFU in the alveoli, denoted as $D_{viable}$, is then found by multiplying the deposited number of CFU by the viability fraction.

To unambiguously represent the number $300$ with two significant figures, we express it in scientific notation.\n$$D_{viable} = 3.0 \\times 10^{2} \\text{ CFU}$$\n\nNext, we must reason whether this resulting dose is plausibly sufficient to pose an infection risk in a susceptible host.\nThe calculated viable dose that reaches the alveoli is $3.0 \\times 10^{2}$ CFU. The pathogenesis of Legionnaires' disease is initiated when *L. pneumophila* are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages. The bacteria have virulence mechanisms that allow them to replicate within these macrophages, shielded from other immune effector mechanisms.\nAs stated in the problem, there is no single fixed infectious dose for *L. pneumophila*. The risk of infection is a complex function of the dose, the virulence of the specific bacterial strain, and, critically, the immune status of the host. Individuals who are elderly, smokers, or have compromised immune systems (e.g., due to immunosuppressive therapy, malignancy, or chronic disease) are considered susceptible.\nInfectious disease literature and epidemiological studies of outbreaks indicate that the infectious dose for Legionnaires' disease can be quite low, particularly for aerosolized bacteria inhaled by susceptible individuals. While it is difficult to determine precise human infectious doses, experimental data from animal models and inferences from outbreak investigations suggest that doses in the range of tens to hundreds of viable organisms can be sufficient to cause disease.\nA dose of $300$ viable bacteria delivered directly to the alveolar space represents a substantial inoculum. In a healthy, immunocompetent host, the innate immune system, led by functional macrophages, might successfully clear this challenge. However, in a susceptible individual, this quantity of bacteria is plausibly sufficient to overwhelm the initial macrophage response, allowing the bacteria to establish a replicative niche, leading to macrophage lysis, infection of adjacent cells, and the onset of progressive pneumonia.\nTherefore, a viable alveolar dose of $3.0 \\times 10^{2}$ CFU is considered a significant exposure that poses a plausible and serious infection risk for a susceptible host.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.0 \\times 10^{2}}\n$$", "id": "4644964"}, {"introduction": "Once a patient presents with symptoms of pneumonia, rapid and accurate diagnosis is critical.

The pretest probability of $30\\%$ was already high, indicating significant clinical suspicion based on the patient's presentation and exposure history. The positive UAT result has substantially increased the certainty of the diagnosis. Given the severity of the pneumonia, this high probability warrants immediate initiation of targeted antimicrobial therapy effective against *Legionella pneumophila*, such as a macrolide (e.g., azithromycin) or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (e.g., levofloxacin).
