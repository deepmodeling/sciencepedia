The lab performs standard phenotypic tests grounded in core microbiological principles: Gram staining (which differentiates bacteria by cell wall structure, with thick peptidoglycan retaining crystal violet), assessment of oxygen tolerance (reflecting the presence or absence of enzymes that detoxify reactive oxygen species), motility (indicating flagellar function), spore formation, blood agar hemolysis at $37^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$, egg yolk agar reactions (reflecting enzymatic hydrolysis of lipids and phospholipids), litmus milk fermentation (acid and gas production), cooked meat medium gas production, and the reverse Christie-Atkins-Munch-Petersen (CAMP) test (which assesses hemolysin interactions).

The problem asks to select the option that most strongly supports this scenario based on the fundamental principles of the listed diagnostic tests.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Clinical Case 1:** Rapidly progressive myonecrosis (gas gangrene) following a crush injury.\n- **Clinical Case 2:** Cafeteria-associated watery diarrhea with onset $8$–$16$ hours post-consumption of a shared meal.\n- **Hypothesis:** A single organism is the etiologic agent for both cases.\n- **Assays:** Gram stain, oxygen tolerance, motility, spore formation, blood agar hemolysis at $37^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$, egg yolk agar reaction, litmus milk fermentation, cooked meat medium gas production, reverse Christie-Atkins-Munch-Petersen (CAMP) test.\n- **Task:** Select the option describing the phenotypic profile that best identifies this single organism, justifying each descriptor based on first principles.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The two clinical presentations, gas gangrene and a food poisoning syndrome with an $8$–$16$ hour incubation period, are classically associated with a single pathogenic species: *Clostridium perfringens*. Gas gangrene is caused by the organism's proliferation and toxin production in anaerobic tissue, while the food poisoning results from the ingestion of large numbers of vegetative cells which then sporulate and release enterotoxin in the small intestine. The provided incubation time of $8$–$16$ hours is characteristic for *C. perfringens* food poisoning. The laboratory tests listed are standard, well-established methods for the phenotypic identification of anaerobic bacteria, particularly *Clostridium* species. The problem is well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. No scientific or logical flaws are present.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe organism that classically causes both gas gangrene and a short-incubation enterotoxic food poisoning is *Clostridium perfringens*. We will derive its expected characteristics based on the provided tests and evaluate the options accordingly.\n\n1.  **Gram Stain and Morphology:** *Clostridium* species possess a thick peptidoglycan cell wall, so they retain the crystal violet stain and are **Gram-positive**. *C. perfringens* is a bacillus (rod), often appearing large and \"boxcar-shaped\". As a member of the genus *Clostridium*, it is **spore-forming**.\n\n2.  **Oxygen Tolerance:** *C. perfringens* lacks key enzymes like catalase and superoxide dismutase, which are required to neutralize toxic byproducts of oxygen metabolism. It is therefore an **obligate anaerobe**, thriving in the anoxic environment of a deep wound or the center of a large, improperly cooled food item.\n\n3.  **Motility:** A key differential feature of *C. perfringens* is that it is **non-motile**, lacking flagella, unlike many other pathogenic clostridia (e.g., *C. tetani*, *C. botulinum*, *C. septicum*).\n\n4.  **Blood Agar Hemolysis:** *C. perfringens* produces multiple toxins that act as hemolysins. On blood agar, this results in a pathognomonic **double zone of hemolysis**: a narrow inner zone of complete (beta) hemolysis caused by perfringolysin O (theta-toxin), and a wider outer zone of incomplete (alpha) hemolysis caused by alpha-toxin (a phospholipase C).\n\n5.  **Egg Yolk Agar Reaction:** This agar contains lecithin, a phospholipid. The major virulence factor of *C. perfringens*, alpha-toxin, is a lecithinase (a type of phospholipase). It hydrolyzes lecithin into insoluble diacylglycerol, creating a **dense, opalescent halo** around the colonies. This reaction is specific and can be neutralized by antitoxin, which is the basis of the Nagler test.\n\n6.  **Litmus Milk Fermentation:** *C. perfringens* is highly saccharolytic and rapidly ferments the lactose in milk. This produces a large volume of acid, which causes the milk protein (casein) to coagulate and form a clot. The simultaneously produced large volume of gas ($H_2$ and $CO_2$) violently tears this clot apart. This entire process is termed **\"stormy fermentation\"** and is highly characteristic of *C. perfringens*.\n\n7.  **Cooked Meat Medium:** This medium supports the growth of anaerobes and demonstrates their metabolic properties. The powerful fermentative capacity of *C. perfringens* leads to **vigorous gas production**.\n\n8.  **Reverse CAMP Test:** This is a specific test for *C. perfringens*. The alpha-toxin of *C. perfringens* acts synergistically with the CAMP factor produced by *Streptococcus agalactiae* (Group B Streptococcus) to enhance the lysis of sheep erythrocytes. This results in an **arrowhead-shaped zone of complete hemolysis** where the two organisms' diffusion zones intersect. A positive test is strong evidence for *C. perfringens*.\n\nWith this complete, principle-based profile, we can now evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Gram-positive, spore-forming rods; non-motile; obligate anaerobic growth; on blood agar at $37^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$, large opaque colonies with a conspicuous inner zone of complete hemolysis and a wider outer zone of partial hemolysis; on egg yolk agar, a dense opalescent halo that is specifically neutralized by antiserum against a phospholipase; litmus milk shows rapid clot formation disrupted by abundant gas (“stormy fermentation”); cooked meat medium shows vigorous gas production; reverse CAMP test yields an arrowhead of enhanced hemolysis at the intersection with Streptococcus agalactiae.**\n\nThis option perfectly matches every single characteristic derived for *Clostridium perfringens*.\n- **Gram-positive, spore-forming-rod:** Correct morphology and structure.\n- **Non-motile:** Correct distinguishing feature.\n- **Obligate anaerobic growth:** Correct oxygen requirement.\n- **Double zone of hemolysis:** A classic, specific description.\n- **Dense opalescent halo...neutralized by antiserum:** A perfect description of the lecithinase (alpha-toxin) activity and the principle of the Nagler test.\n- **Stormy fermentation:** The pathognomonic reaction in litmus milk.\n- **Vigorous gas production in cooked meat:** Correct metabolic observation.\n- **Positive reverse CAMP test:** A specific, confirmatory identification test.\nEach descriptor is not only correct but highly informative and, in combination, definitive for the identification of *C. perfringens*.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Gram-positive, spore-forming rods; motile with swarming on soft agar; aerotolerant growth; on blood agar, a single uniform zone of beta-hemolysis; on egg yolk agar, no opalescent halo; litmus milk shows slow acid formation without gas; reverse CAMP test negative.**\n\nThis option describes a different clostridial species, not *C. perfringens*. Key errors include: **motile** (*C. perfringens* is non-motile), **aerotolerant** (*C. perfringens* is an obligate anaerobe), **single zone of hemolysis** (not the characteristic double zone), **no opalescent halo** (incorrect, lecithinase is a key a feature), **no gas in litmus milk** (incorrect, gas production is vigorous), and **negative reverse CAMP test** (incorrect, test is positive).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Gram-negative rods; facultative anaerobes; oxidase negative; on MacConkey agar, lactose-fermenting pink colonies with bile precipitation; on blood agar at $37^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$, non-hemolytic; litmus milk shows acid with minimal gas; egg yolk agar negative; reverse CAMP test negative.**\n\nThis profile describes a Gram-negative enteric bacterium, such as *Escherichia coli*. It is fundamentally different from a *Clostridium* species. Key errors include **Gram-negative** (vs. Gram-positive), **facultative anaerobe** (vs. obligate anaerobe), and growth/reactions on selective media for Gram-negatives. This organism does not cause gas gangrene.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Gram-positive cocci in clusters; catalase positive; coagulase positive; strong beta-hemolysis at $37^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$; growth in air and $5\\%$ carbon dioxide; egg yolk agar negative; litmus milk unchanged; reverse CAMP test irrelevant due to morphology mismatch.**\n\nThis is a textbook description of *Staphylococcus aureus*. Key errors include **cocci in clusters** (vs. spore-forming rods), **catalase positive** (clostridia are negative), and being a facultative anaerobe (\"growth in air\"). While *S. aureus* causes food poisoning and wound infections, it does not cause gas gangrene, is not a spore-former, and does not match the clinical or microbiological profile.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Gram-positive, spore-forming rods; obligate anaerobes; motile; on egg yolk agar, a pearly sheen consistent with lipase activity but no opalescent lecithinase halo; colonies are proteolytic with a distinct odor; on blood agar, weak hemolysis; litmus milk proteolysis without gas; reverse CAMP test negative.**\n\nThis profile is suggestive of other *Clostridium* species, such as *C. botulinum* or *C. sporogenes*. Key errors for *C. perfringens* identification include **motile**, presence of **lipase but no lecithinase** (the opposite of *C. perfringens* which is lecithinase-positive and lipase-negative), predominantly **proteolytic** reaction in milk without gas (vs. stormy fermentation), and **negative reverse CAMP test**. This organism does not fit the dual clinical picture.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4620352"}, {"introduction": "Once a pathogen is identified, the next critical task is to understand how it causes disease.

Non-clostridial necrotizing fasciitis, dominated by streptolysin O from Streptococcus pyogenes, explaining crepitus and bullae in the injured compartment", "solution": "The user has provided a clinical vignette and asks for an interpretation of the stage of disease and the dominant pathophysiological mechanisms, specifically related to *Clostridium perfringens* myonecrosis.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Patient Profile**: A previously healthy $24$-year-old man.\n- **Injury**: Deep, contaminated crush injury to the calf from a farm accident.\n- **Time Course**: Presentation is $12$ hours post-injury.\n- **Chief Complaint**: Severe pain, rated $9/10$, described as deep and out of proportion to the external appearance of the wound.\n- **Physical Examination Findings**:\n    - **Local**: The skin over the injured compartment is pale, tense, and cool. A few small, clear bullae are present. Faint crepitus is elicited on palpation. There is minimal erythema and no purulent drainage.\n    - **Vital Signs**: Heart rate is $110\\,\\mathrm{beats/min}$, blood pressure is $98/60\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, respiratory rate is $22\\,\\mathrm{breaths/min}$, and temperature is $38.1\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n- **Laboratory Findings**:\n    - Serum lactate: $4.8\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$.\n    - Serum creatine kinase (CK): $12{,}000\\,\\mathrm{IU/L}$.\n    - Hemoglobin: Stable, with no evidence of gross intravascular hemolysis.\n- **Governing Principles**: The inference must be based on the fundamental pathophysiology of anaerobic wound infections, growth in hypoxic tissue, and toxin-mediated membrane injury by *Clostridium perfringens*.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is scientifically grounded. The clinical presentation is a classic textbook case of clostridial myonecrosis (gas gangrene). The inciting event (deep, contaminated crush injury), rapid onset, specific local signs (pain out of proportion, tenseness, coolness, crepitus, bullae), systemic signs (tachycardia, hypotension, fever, tachypnea, meeting criteria for Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome or SIRS), and laboratory markers (markedly elevated CK, elevated lactate) are all consistent with this diagnosis. The pathophysiology of *C. perfringens*, involving alpha toxin and theta toxin, is a cornerstone of medical microbiology.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. Sufficient clinical and laboratory data are provided to allow for a reasoned deduction about the disease stage and the relative contribution of different toxins. The question asks for the best integration of findings, implying a unique optimal answer exists among the choices.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, clinical language, free of bias or subjective claims.\n\n**Verdict**: The problem statement is valid. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective question rooted in established medical principles.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Option Analysis\n\n**Analysis of the Clinical Picture:**\n\nThe patient's presentation must be dissected and mapped onto the known progression of clostridial myonecrosis.\n\n1.  **Local Disease**: The injury created a deep, devitalized, anaerobic environment, ideal for the germination of *C. perfringens* spores and vegetative growth.\n    - **Myonecrosis**: The massive elevation of creatine kinase to $12{,}000\\,\\mathrm{IU/L}$ is definitive evidence of extensive muscle necrosis. This is driven primarily by **alpha toxin (phospholipase C)**, which hydrolyzes phospholipids in muscle cell membranes, causing cell lysis and tissue death.\n    - **Edema and Ischemia**: The tense, pale, and cool limb reflects significant edema within the fascial compartment, increasing pressure and compromising blood flow, leading to further ischemia and necrosis, creating a vicious cycle. Alpha toxin also contributes to this by destroying capillary membranes.\n    - **Gas Production**: The faint crepitus is the clinical sign of gas in the tissues, a result of the fermentative metabolism of carbohydrates by *C. perfringens*, producing hydrogen and carbon dioxide. \"Faint\" suggests this is an evolving, not yet extensive, feature.\n    - **Bullae**: The presence of bullae indicates that the necrosis and edema are sufficient to cause separation of the epidermal-dermal junction. The disease is past the earliest incipient stage.\n\n2.  **Systemic Disease**: The patient's vital signs (HR $110\\,\\mathrm{beats/min}$, BP $98/60\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, RR $22\\,\\mathrm{breaths/min}$, T $38.1\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$) demonstrate systemic toxicity, consistent with SIRS and early septic shock.\n    - **Cardiovascular Effects**: The tachycardia and hypotension are driven by systemic toxin effects and the inflammatory response. While alpha toxin contributes, **theta toxin (perfringolysin O)**, a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, is particularly known for its cardiotoxic effects and its ability to increase vascular permeability, leading to fluid shifts and hypotension (vascular leak). The patient's state indicates these systemic effects are now clinically significant.\n    - **Hemolysis**: The problem explicitly states there is **no evidence of gross intravascular hemolysis** and hemoglobin is stable. Alpha toxin is a potent hemolysin. Massive intravascular hemolysis, leading to clinical jaundice, acute kidney injury, and hemoglobinuria, is a feature of fulminant, often pre-terminal, clostridial sepsis. The absence of this sign is a key staging element, indicating the disease has not yet reached its most severe systemic manifestation.\n\n**Staging Synthesis**:\nThe patient is in a middle, progressive stage of gas gangrene. The infection is no longer purely localized (ruling out an \"early\" stage with minimal systemic effects) but has not yet progressed to fulminant sepsis with massive hemolysis (ruling out the \"fulminant\" end-stage). The local myonecrosis, driven by alpha toxin, is well-established. The systemic toxicity, characterized by early shock, is emerging, indicating an increasing role for toxins with systemic effects like theta toxin.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis:**\n\n- **A. Early, pre-bullous myonecrosis dominated by alpha toxin (phospholipase C; lecithinase) disrupting cell membranes, with spread primarily via hyaluronidase; minimal systemic involvement**\n  - **Analysis**: This option is incorrect for two reasons. First, the patient has bullae, so the stage is not \"pre-bullous\". Second, the patient exhibits clear systemic involvement (tachycardia, hypotension, fever, elevated lactate), which contradicts \"minimal systemic involvement\".\n  - **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n- **B. Progressive myonecrosis with emerging bullae and gas, dominated by alpha toxin–mediated myonecrosis and hemolysis, with theta toxin (perfringolysin O; cholesterol-dependent cytolysin) beginning to contribute to vascular injury and cardiovascular depression**\n  - **Analysis**: This option accurately captures the state of the patient. The stage is \"progressive\" with \"emerging bullae and gas\". The local disease is correctly attributed to the dominance of \"alpha toxin–mediated myonecrosis\". The mention of hemolysis is pathophysiologically correct, as alpha toxin is a hemolysin, even if systemic *gross* intravascular hemolysis is not yet apparent. Most importantly, it correctly describes the systemic picture as theta toxin \"beginning to contribute to vascular injury and cardiovascular depression,\" which perfectly explains the developing shock (hypotension, tachycardia). This option provides the most accurate and integrated description of the patient's condition.\n  - **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n- **C. Fulminant clostridial sepsis and shock, dominated by theta toxin causing marked capillary leak and cardiac depression, typically with profound hypotension, jaundice, and massive intravascular hemolysis**\n  - **Analysis**: This describes a later, more severe stage than presented. The patient does not have the \"massive intravascular hemolysis\" or \"jaundice\" characteristic of this fulminant stage, as explicitly noted in the problem statement (\"stable hemoglobin without evidence of gross intravascular hemolysis\"). While the patient is hypotensive, it is not yet described as \"profound\" or refractory shock.\n  - **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n- **D. Clostridium perfringens food poisoning stage, dominated by enterotoxin (Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin), presenting with watery diarrhea without notable wound findings**\n  - **Analysis**: This describes a completely different clinical entity caused by *C. perfringens*. Food poisoning is a gastrointestinal illness mediated by an enterotoxin and does not involve wound infection or myonecrosis. This option is irrelevant to the clinical scenario.\n  - **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n- **E. Non-clostridial necrotizing fasciitis, dominated by streptolysin O from Streptococcus pyogenes, explaining crepitus and bullae in the injured compartment**\n  - **Analysis**: This proposes an alternative diagnosis. While *S. pyogenes* causes necrotizing fasciitis, significant gas production (crepitus) is much more characteristic of clostridial infections. Furthermore, the problem explicitly frames the question around the pathophysiology of *Clostridium perfringens*. Therefore, an option that deviates from this assumed diagnosis is not the intended answer based on the task prompt. The massive myonecrosis (CK $12{,}000\\,\\mathrm{IU/L}$) is also more typical for clostridial myonecrosis than for streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis, which primarily affects fascial planes.\n  - **Verdict**: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4620322"}, {"introduction": "Medical microbiology extends beyond the individual patient to the health of the entire community.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe objective is to identify the source of a *Clostridium perfringens* food poisoning outbreak by calculating the relative risk associated with each food item consumed at a luncheon.\n\nFirst, we define the key epidemiological metrics. The attack rate (AR) is the proportion of a group that becomes ill. It is a measure of incidence. We calculate it separately for the group exposed to a food item ($AR_E$) and the group not exposed ($AR_{NE}$).\n\nLet $N_E$ be the number of individuals exposed to a food item and $I_E$ be the number of ill individuals within that group. The attack rate for the exposed group is:\n$$AR_E = \\frac{I_E}{N_E}$$\nLet $N_{NE}$ be the number of individuals not exposed to the food item and $I_{NE}$ be the number of ill individuals within that group. The attack rate for the non-exposed group is:\n$$AR_{NE} = \\frac{I_{NE}}{N_{NE}}$$\nThe relative risk (RR) is the ratio of the attack rate in the exposed group to the attack rate in the non-exposed group. It quantifies the association between the exposure (eating the food item) and the outcome (illness).\n$$RR = \\frac{AR_E}{AR_{NE}} = \\frac{I_E / N_E}{I_{NE} / N_{NE}}$$\nAn $RR > 1$ indicates a positive association (increased risk), an $RR  1$ indicates a negative association (a protective effect), and an $RR = 1$ indicates no association. The item with the highest relative risk is the most likely vehicle of infection.\n\nWe will now compute the $AR_E$, $AR_{NE}$, and $RR$ for each menu item.\n\n1.  **Beef gravy**:\n    - Exposed: $I_E = 44$, $N_E = 72$.\n    - Non-exposed: $I_{NE} = 4$, $N_{NE} = 48$.\n    - $AR_E = \\frac{44}{72} \\approx 0.6111$\n    - $AR_{NE} = \\frac{4}{48} = \\frac{1}{12} \\approx 0.0833$\n    - $RR = \\frac{44/72}{4/48} = \\frac{44}{72} \\times \\frac{48}{4} = \\frac{11}{18} \\times 12 = \\frac{11 \\times 2}{3} = \\frac{22}{3} \\approx 7.333$\n\n2.  **Roast beef**:\n    - Exposed: $I_E = 24$, $N_E = 80$.\n    - Non-exposed: $I_{NE} = 24$, $N_{NE} = 40$.\n    - $AR_E = \\frac{24}{80} = 0.3$\n    - $AR_{NE} = \\frac{24}{40} = 0.6$\n    - $RR = \\frac{0.3}{0.6} = 0.5$\n\n3.  **Potato salad**:\n    - Exposed: $I_E = 13$, $N_E = 70$.\n    - Non-exposed: $I_{NE} = 35$, $N_{NE} = 50$.\n    - $AR_E = \\frac{13}{70} \\approx 0.1857$\n    - $AR_{NE} = \\frac{35}{50} = 0.7$\n    - $RR = \\frac{13/70}{35/50} = \\frac{13}{70} \\times \\frac{50}{35} = \\frac{13}{7} \\times \\frac{5}{35} = \\frac{13}{7} \\times \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{13}{49} \\approx 0.2653$\n\n4.  **Green beans**:\n    - Exposed: $I_E = 25$, $N_E = 90$.\n    - Non-exposed: $I_{NE} = 23$, $N_{NE} = 30$.\n    - $AR_E = \\frac{25}{90} = \\frac{5}{18} \\approx 0.2778$\n    - $AR_{NE} = \\frac{23}{30} \\approx 0.7667$\n    - $RR = \\frac{25/90}{23/30} = \\frac{25}{90} \\times \\frac{30}{23} = \\frac{25}{3 \\times 23} = \\frac{25}{69} \\approx 0.3623$\n\n5.  **Dinner rolls**:\n    - Exposed: $I_E = 40$, $N_E = 100$.\n    - Non-exposed: $I_{NE} = 8$, $N_{NE} = 20$.\n    - $AR_E = \\frac{40}{100} = 0.4$\n    - $AR_{NE} = \\frac{8}{20} = 0.4$\n    - $RR = \\frac{0.4}{0.4} = 1.0$\n\n6.  **Spiced tofu stew**:\n    - Exposed: $I_E = 18$, $N_E = 30$.\n    - Non-exposed: $I_{NE} = 30$, $N_{NE} = 90$.\n    - $AR_E = \\frac{18}{30} = 0.6$\n    - $AR_{NE} = \\frac{30}{90} = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.3333$\n    - $RR = \\frac{0.6}{1/3} = 0.6 \\times 3 = 1.8$\n\nSummary of Relative Risks:\n- Beef gravy: $RR \\approx 7.33$\n- Roast beef: $RR = 0.5$\n- Potato salad: $RR \\approx 0.27$\n- Green beans: $RR \\approx 0.36$\n- Dinner rolls: $RR = 1.0$\n- Spiced tofu stew: $RR = 1.8$\n\nThe beef gravy has a relative risk of approximately $7.33$, which is substantially higher than that of any other food item. This indicates that individuals who ate the beef gravy were over $7$ times more likely to become ill than those who did not. The spiced tofu stew shows a modest association with illness ($RR = 1.8$), while the dinner rolls show no association ($RR = 1.0$). The other items show a protective effect ($RR  1$).\n\nCombining this statistical evidence with the known pathogenesis of *Clostridium perfringens* food poisoning, the conclusion is further strengthened. *C. perfringens* outbreaks are typically linked to meat products, stews, and gravies that are prepared in large quantities and then improperly cooled or stored. This allows germination of heat-resistant spores and subsequent proliferation of vegetative bacteria, which produce the enterotoxin. Beef gravy is a classic vehicle for this type of foodborne illness.\n\nTherefore, the beef gravy is unequivocally the single most likely vehicle of infection, based on both the strong epidemiological association and microbiological plausibility. The relative risk associated with the beef gravy is $\\frac{22}{3}$. Rounding this to three significant figures gives $7.33$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{7.33}\n$$", "id": "4620312"}]}
