It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem describes a population undergoing continuous-time exponential growth. The population size $N(t)$ at any time $t$ can be modeled by the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\n$$\nwhere $r$ is the constant per-capita growth rate. The solution to this equation, given an initial population $N_{0}$ at $t=0$, is:\n$$\nN(t) = N_{0} \\exp(rt)\n$$\n\nThe doubling time, $T_{d}$, is defined as the time required for the population to double. At $t = T_{d}$, the population is $N(T_{d}) = 2N_{0}$. Substituting this into the growth equation gives:\n$$\n2N_{0} = N_{0} \\exp(rT_{d})\n$$\nDividing by $N_{0}$ (since $N_{0} > 0$), we get:\n$$\n2 = \\exp(rT_{d})\n$$\nTo find the relationship between the growth rate $r$ and the doubling time $T_{d}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln(2) = rT_{d}\n$$\nSolving for $r$ yields:\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_{d}}\n$$\nThis expression allows us to relate the growth rate directly to the empirically measured doubling time.\n\nWe are asked to find the time $t$ required for the population to grow from $N_{0} = 10^{3}$ to $N_{f} = 10^{6}$. We set $N(t) = N_{f}$ in the growth equation:\n$$\nN_{f} = N_{0} \\exp(rt)\n$$\nTo solve for $t$, we first divide by $N_{0}$:\n$$\n\\frac{N_{f}}{N_{0}} = \\exp(rt)\n$$\nThen, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{f}}{N_{0}}\\right) = rt\n$$\nSolving for $t$, we find:\n$$\nt = \\frac{1}{r} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{f}}{N_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nNow, substitute the expression $r = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_{d}}$ into the equation for $t$:\n$$\nt = \\left(\\frac{T_{d}}{\\ln(2)}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{f}}{N_{0}}\\right) = T_{d} \\frac{\\ln(N_{f}/N_{0})}{\\ln(2)}\n$$\nThis is the general formula for the time required. The term $\\frac{\\ln(N_{f}/N_{0})}{\\ln(2)}$ can be recognized as $\\log_{2}(N_{f}/N_{0})$, which represents the number of doublings required to reach the final population.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- $N_{0} = 10^{3}$\n- $N_{f} = 10^{6}$\nThe ratio is $\\frac{N_{f}}{N_{0}} = \\frac{10^{6}}{10^{3}} = 10^{3}$.\nSubstituting this ratio into our formula for $t$:\n$$\nt = T_{d} \\frac{\\ln(10^{3})}{\\ln(2)} = T_{d} \\frac{3\\ln(10)}{\\ln(2)}\n$$\nWe need to calculate the time for the two boundary values of the doubling time interval $T_{d} \\in [12, 14]$ days.\n\nCase 1: Minimum time, $t_{\\min}$, corresponding to the minimum doubling time, $T_{d} = 12$ days.\n$$\nt_{\\min} = 12 \\frac{\\ln(1000)}{\\ln(2)}\n$$\nUsing the values $\\ln(1000) \\approx 6.907755$ and $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$:\n$$\nt_{\\min} \\approx 12 \\times \\frac{6.907755}{0.693147} \\approx 12 \\times 9.965784 \\approx 119.5894 \\text{ days}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $t_{\\min} = 119.6$ days.\n\nCase 2: Maximum time, $t_{\\max}$, corresponding to the maximum doubling time, $T_{d} = 14$ days.\n$$\nt_{\\max} = 14 \\frac{\\ln(1000)}{\\ln(2)}\n$$\nUsing the same factor calculated previously:\n$$\nt_{\\max} \\approx 14 \\times 9.965784 \\approx 139.5210 \\text{ days}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $t_{\\max} = 139.5$ days.\n\nThe final answer is the ordered pair $(t_{\\min}, t_{\\max})$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 119.6 & 139.5 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4670564"}, {"introduction": "Translating microbiological knowledge into effective clinical action is a cornerstone of medicine.

The clinical presentation is a classic example of leprosy. The classification system (paucibacillary vs. multibacillary) and treatment regimens (WHO-MDT) are standard medical practice worldwide. The foundational bases provided are accurate representations of lepidology principles: bacterial load correlates with lesion count, SSS has low sensitivity in early or less bacillated forms, and the classification's public health goal is to err on the side of caution to prevent undertreatment. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness and Objectivity:** The problem provides clear, objective clinical data ($7$ lesions, negative SSS) and a specific framework for decision-making (WHO operational classification). The question is unambiguous and seeks a single correct application of these guidelines. The information is sufficient and self-contained to arrive at a definite conclusion. There are no contradictions; the scenario of having more than $5$ lesions with a negative SSS is a common clinical reality, explicitly accommodated by the WHO guidelines.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically accurate, well-posed, and objective. A definitive solution can be derived from the provided information and foundational principles. Proceeding to solution derivation.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe central task is to apply the World Health Organization (WHO) operational classification for leprosy to determine the correct treatment regimen. This classification scheme is intentionally simplified for wide applicability in field conditions and is based primarily on easily observable signs.\n\nThe primary determinant for WHO operational classification is the number of skin lesions:\n1.  **Paucibacillary (PB) Leprosy:** Defined as having $1$ to $5$ skin lesions.\n2.  **Multibacillary (MB) Leprosy:** Defined as having more than $5$ skin lesions.\n\nThe patient is described as having \"$7$ hypopigmented, anesthetic macules\". Since the number of lesions, $n=7$, is greater than $5$, the patient must be classified as having **Multibacillary (MB) leprosy**.\n\nThe result of the slit-skin smear (SSS) is a secondary consideration. A positive SSS automatically classifies a patient as MB, regardless of the lesion count. However, a negative SSS does **not** override the classification based on lesion count. As stated in foundational basis (ii), the SSS has limited sensitivity, especially in forms of leprosy with a lower bacterial index. Classifying a patient with more than $5$ lesions as PB based on a negative smear would risk undertreatment. This aligns with foundational basis (iii), which states the classification aims to minimize undertreatment. Therefore, this patient with $7$ lesions and a negative SSS is correctly classified as MB.\n\nHaving established the classification as MB leprosy, the next step is to identify the standard WHO-recommended Multidrug Therapy (MDT) regimen for this category.\n- **For MB leprosy in adults**, the standard regimen is a $12$-month course of three drugs:\n    - **Monthly, supervised component:** Rifampicin and Clofazimine.\n    - **Daily, self-administered component:** Dapsone and Clofazimine.\n\nThis regimen is designed to be bactericidal and to prevent the development of drug resistance.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Classify as paucibacillary (PB) leprosy and prescribe WHO PB-MDT for $6$ months consisting of monthly supervised rifampicin and daily dapsone.**\n- **Evaluation:** This classification is incorrect. The patient has $7$ lesions, which is above the threshold of $5$ lesions for PB classification. The WHO operational guidelines are explicit on this point. Consequently, the proposed PB regimen is inappropriate and would constitute significant undertreatment.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Classify as multibacillary (MB) leprosy and prescribe WHO MB-MDT for $12$ months consisting of monthly supervised rifampicin and clofazimine with daily dapsone and clofazimine.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option correctly classifies the patient as MB based on the lesion count of $7$. It also correctly identifies the standard WHO-MDT regimen for MB leprosy: a $12$-month, three-drug course involving rifampicin, clofazimine, and dapsone, with the appropriate administration schedule implied. This aligns perfectly with the derivation.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**C. Classify as borderline tuberculoid leprosy and prescribe a $6$-month two-drug regimen because the slit-skin smear is negative.**\n- **Evaluation:** \"Borderline tuberculoid\" is a term from the Ridley-Jopling spectral classification, which is immunological and histopathological. The problem specifically asks for the **operational classification** for treatment. While the clinical picture may be consistent with borderline tuberculoid leprosy, the operational classification is MB. Furthermore, using the negative SSS to justify a $6$-month PB regimen is a critical error that ignores the primary criterion of lesion count, leading to undertreatment.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Defer classification and treatment until histopathology and Mycobacterium leprae polymerase chain reaction results are available, because a negative slit-skin smear precludes multibacillary classification.**\n- **Evaluation:** This is incorrect on two grounds. First, the premise that a negative SSS precludes MB classification is false; lesion count is the primary criterion. Second, the WHO operational classification system is designed specifically to allow for prompt initiation of treatment based on simple clinical signs, without waiting for advanced diagnostics like histopathology or PCR, which are often unavailable in endemic settings. Deferring treatment is contrary to the public health goals of leprosy control.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Classify as single-lesion paucibacillary disease and prescribe single-dose rifampicin–ofloxacin–minocycline (ROM) because there is no nerve enlargement and the slit-skin smear is negative.**\n- **Evaluation:** The patient has $7$ lesions. The diagnosis of \"single-lesion\" disease is factually incorrect. The ROM regimen is indicated only for patients with a single skin lesion. Applying this classification and treatment is a gross misinterpretation of the clinical data.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4670604"}, {"introduction": "Beyond diagnosing and treating individual patients, controlling an infectious disease like leprosy requires effective public health strategies, including population screening.

This is the true negative rate.\n$$P(T^- | D^c) = 95\\% = 0.95$$\n\nFrom specificity, we can determine the false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test given that the individual does not have the disease.\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\n\nThe problem asks for the positive predictive value (PPV), which is defined as the probability that an individual truly has the disease given a positive test result, i.e., $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap T^+)$, is the probability of a true positive event (having the disease and testing positive). It can be expressed as:\n$$P(D \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D)$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. We can expand this using the law of total probability, which states that the probability of an event can be found by summing its probabilities over a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events (in this case, $D$ and $D^c$).\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability again:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\n\nCombining these expressions yields the formula for PPV, an application of Bayes' theorem:\n$$PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into this expression:\n$$PPV = \\frac{(0.70)(0.01)}{(0.70)(0.01) + (0.05)(0.99)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.007}{0.007 + 0.0495}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.007}{0.0565}$$\n$$PPV \\approx 0.1238938...$$\n\nRounding the result to $4$ significant figures, we get:\n$$PPV \\approx 0.1239$$\n\n**Inference on Efficiency as a Stand-Alone Screening Tool**\n\nThe calculated positive predictive value of approximately $0.1239$ means that when an individual receives a positive test result in this screening program, there is only a $12.39\\%$ probability that they actually have multibacillary leprosy. Conversely, there is an $1 - 0.1239 = 0.8761$ or $87.61\\%$ probability that the positive result is a false positive.\n\nFrom first principles, a screening tool's purpose is to efficiently and accurately identify individuals in a large, often asymptomatic population who are likely to have a disease, thereby warranting further, more definitive diagnostic assessment. For a test to be considered efficient as a *stand-alone* tool, a positive result should carry a high probability of being correct.\n\nIn this case, for every $100$ individuals who test positive, approximately $88$ will be disease-free ($P(D^c | T^+) = 1 - PPV$). Using this test as a stand-alone tool would lead to the misclassification of a very large number of healthy people as potentially diseased. This has several major negative consequences:\n$1$. It leads to immense resource inefficiency. The vast majority of resources allocated for follow-up (confirmatory tests, clinical consultations) would be spent on individuals who do not have the disease.\n$2$. It causes significant unnecessary anxiety, psychological distress, and social stigma for the large number of individuals receiving false positive results.\n$3$. It erodes trust in the public health system.\n\nTherefore, because the probability of a positive test being a true positive is very low ($12.39\\%$), this assay is highly inefficient as a stand-alone community screening tool in a population with a $1\\%$ prevalence. The low PPV is a direct mathematical consequence of applying a test with imperfect specificity to a population with low disease prevalence. Even a high specificity like $95\\%$ yields a substantial number of false positives when the number of non-diseased individuals ($99\\%$ of the population) is much larger than the number of diseased individuals ($1\\%$ of the population). The test would be more appropriately used as part of a multi-stage screening or diagnostic algorithm, not as a stand-alone determinant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1239}$$", "id": "4655789"}]}
