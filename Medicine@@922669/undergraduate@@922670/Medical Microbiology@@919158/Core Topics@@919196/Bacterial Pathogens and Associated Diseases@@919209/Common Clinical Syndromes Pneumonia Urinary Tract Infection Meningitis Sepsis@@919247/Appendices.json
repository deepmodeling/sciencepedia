The fundamental base for this model is that the instantaneous rate of change of the population size is proportional to its current size with a constant per-capita rate under fixed environmental conditions. Specifically, assume the per-capita growth rate is constant and equal to $r$, and the initial condition at $t=0$ is a single well-mixed inoculum of $N_{0}$ colony-forming units (CFU). The clinically relevant threshold for overt pneumonia is reached when the population attains $N$ CFU.\n\nUsing only the stated base (that the instantaneous rate of change is proportional to population size with constant per-capita rate), derive the time $t$ required for the bacterial population to grow from $N_{0}$ to $N$ under these early-phase conditions.
