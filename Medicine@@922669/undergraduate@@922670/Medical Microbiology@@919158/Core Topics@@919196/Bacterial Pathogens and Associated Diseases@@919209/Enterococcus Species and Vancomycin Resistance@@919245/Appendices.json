Consider the binding of vancomycin to the peptidoglycan precursor in Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium). In vancomycin-susceptible strains, the target terminus is D-alanyl-D-alanine, whereas in VanA-type resistant strains, the terminus is remodeled to D-alanyl-D-lactate, which is empirically observed to increase the dissociation constant by approximately $1000$-fold at physiological temperature $T=310\\,\\mathrm{K}$. Let the binding reaction be represented as $L + R \\rightleftharpoons LR$, where $L$ is vancomycin, $R$ is the target terminus, and $LR$ is the bound complex. Starting from the fundamental definitions of the association constant $K_{a}$ and dissociation constant $K_{d}$ for this equilibrium, and the thermodynamic definition of the standard Gibbs free energy change $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ for an equilibrium process, derive the expression that links the standard binding free energy $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{bind}}$ to $K_{d}$.

Finally, interpret the pharmacological consequence for activity at a fixed extracellular vancomycin concentration by reasoning from receptor occupancy and thermodynamic favorability, without invoking any empirical minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values.", "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established biochemical basis of vancomycin resistance, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and expressed in objective, precise language. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part solution: first, a derivation of the relationship between the standard binding free energy ($\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{bind}}$) and the dissociation constant ($K_d$); second, the calculation of the change in this free energy ($\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{bind}}$) due to resistance; and third, an interpretation of the pharmacological consequences.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the relationship between $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{bind}}$ and $K_d$.\n\nThe binding reaction is given by the equilibrium:\n$$L + R \\rightleftharpoons LR$$\nwhere $L$ represents vancomycin (the ligand), $R$ represents the peptidoglycan precursor terminus (the receptor), and $LR$ is the bound complex.\n\nThe association constant, $K_a$, for this binding equilibrium is defined as the ratio of the concentration of the product to the concentrations of the reactants at equilibrium:\n$$K_a = \\frac{[LR]}{[L][R]}$$\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, is the reciprocal of the association constant and corresponds to the equilibrium constant for the reverse reaction, $LR \\rightleftharpoons L + R$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_a} = \\frac{[L][R]}{[LR]}$$\nThe standard Gibbs free energy change for a reaction, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$, is related to its equilibrium constant, $K_{eq}$, by the fundamental thermodynamic equation:\n$$\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -RT \\ln(K_{eq})$$\nwhere $R$ is the molar gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe standard binding free energy, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{bind}}$, corresponds to the association process $L + R \\rightarrow LR$. The equilibrium constant for this process is $K_a$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{bind}} = -RT \\ln(K_a)$$\nTo relate this to the dissociation constant, $K_d$, we substitute $K_a = 1/K_d$:\n$$\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{bind}} = -RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{K_d}\\right)$$\nUsing the logarithmic identity $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$, the expression becomes:\n$$\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{bind}} = -RT(-\\ln(K_d)) = RT \\ln(K_d)$$\nThis is the required expression linking the standard binding free energy to the dissociation constant. A more negative $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{bind}}$ indicates stronger binding, which corresponds to a smaller $K_d$ value (note that for $K_d < 1$, $\\ln(K_d)$ is negative).\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the change in standard binding free energy, $\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{bind}}$.\n\nLet the parameters for the vancomycin-susceptible (S) and vancomycin-resistant (R) strains be denoted by the subscripts $S$ and $R$, respectively.\nThe standard binding free energy for the susceptible strain is:\n$$\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{S} = RT \\ln(K_{d,S})$$\nThe standard binding free energy for the resistant strain is:\n$$\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{R} = RT \\ln(K_{d,R})$$\nThe change in standard binding free energy, $\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{bind}}$, upon acquiring resistance is the difference between these two values:\n$$\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{bind}} = \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{R} - \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{S}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the Gibbs free energies:\n$$\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{bind}} = RT \\ln(K_{d,R}) - RT \\ln(K_{d,S})$$\nFactoring out the $RT$ term and using the logarithmic identity $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$:\n$$\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{bind}} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_{d,R}}{K_{d,S}}\\right)$$\nThe problem states that the dissociation constant increases $1000$-fold in the resistant strain, which means the ratio $\\frac{K_{d,R}}{K_{d,S}} = 1000$.\nSubstituting the given values $R = 8.314$ $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$ and $T = 310$ $\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{bind}} = (8.314 \\mathrm{~J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (310 \\mathrm{~K}) \\times \\ln(1000)$$\n$$\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{bind}} \\approx (2577.34 \\mathrm{~J\\,mol^{-1}}) \\times (6.907755)$$\n$$\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{bind}} \\approx 17804.55 \\mathrm{~J\\,mol^{-1}}$$\nTo express the answer in kilojoules per mole ($\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$), we divide by $1000$:\n$$\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{bind}} \\approx 17.80455 \\mathrm{~kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested gives:\n$$\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{bind}} = 17.80 \\mathrm{~kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$$\n\nPart 3: Interpretation of the pharmacological consequence.\n\nThe positive value of $\\Delta \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{bind}} = +17.80 \\mathrm{~kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ indicates that the binding of vancomycin to the D-alanyl-D-lactate target in the resistant strain is substantially less thermodynamically favorable than its binding to the D-alanyl-D-alanine target in the susceptible strain. This thermodynamic penalty directly translates to a reduced efficacy at the molecular level.\n\nTo formalize this, we consider the fractional receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, which is the fraction of target sites bound by the drug. For a simple $1:1$ binding equilibrium, $\\theta$ is given by the Hill-Langmuir equation:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_d}$$\nThis equation demonstrates that for a fixed drug concentration $[L]$, the occupancy $\\theta$ is inversely related to the dissociation constant $K_d$.\n\nIn the resistant strain, $K_d$ is $1000$ times larger than in the susceptible strain ($K_{d,R} = 1000 \\times K_{d,S}$). At any given extracellular vancomycin concentration $[L]$, the target occupancy in the resistant strain ($\\theta_R$) will be drastically lower than in the susceptible strain ($\\theta_S$).\n\nFor example, at a vancomycin concentration equal to the $K_d$ of the susceptible strain, i.e., $[L] = K_{d,S}$:\n- Occupancy in the susceptible strain: $\\theta_S = \\frac{K_{d,S}}{K_{d,S} + K_{d,S}} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$, or $50\\%$ occupancy.\n- Occupancy in the resistant strain: $\\theta_R = \\frac{K_{d,S}}{K_{d,S} + K_{d,R}} = \\frac{K_{d,S}}{K_{d,S} + 1000 K_{d,S}} = \\frac{1}{1001} \\approx 0.001$, or approximately $0.1\\%$ occupancy.\n\nThe pharmacological consequence is a profound failure of the drug to engage its target. Vancomycin's mechanism of action relies on binding to the peptidoglycan precursors to sterically hinder the transglycosylase and transpeptidase enzymes, thereby inhibiting cell wall synthesis. The $1000$-fold increase in $K_d$ means that a $1000$-fold higher concentration of vancomycin would be required to achieve the same level of target occupancy as in the susceptible strain. Such high concentrations are not clinically achievable or safe. Therefore, the remodeling of the target terminus from D-Ala-D-Ala to D-Ala-D-Lac confers resistance by making the drug-target binding event so thermodynamically unfavorable that effective target occupancy cannot be reached at therapeutic drug concentrations. This loss of affinity is the direct molecular cause of resistance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{17.80}$$", "id": "4641792"}, {"introduction": "In a clinical setting, we often infer the genetic basis of resistance by observing an organism's susceptibility profile, or phenotype.
