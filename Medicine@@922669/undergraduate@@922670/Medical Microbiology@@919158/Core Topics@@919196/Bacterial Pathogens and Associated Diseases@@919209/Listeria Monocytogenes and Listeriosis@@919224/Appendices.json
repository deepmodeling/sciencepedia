It is scientifically grounded in the principles of microbial thermal inactivation kinetics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and expressed objectively.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two key parameters in thermal processing: the decimal reduction time ($D$-value) and the thermal resistance parameter ($z$-value).\n\n**1. Calculation of the $D$-value at $62\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ($D_{62}$)**\n\nThe decimal reduction time, or $D$-value, is defined as the time needed at a specific temperature to reduce the number of viable microorganisms by $90\\%$, which is equivalent to a one-order-of-magnitude or $1$-log reduction. The inactivation process is described by first-order kinetics, represented by a log-linear survivor curve. The governing equation is:\n$$ \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right) = -\\frac{t}{D} $$\nwhere $N(t)$ is the population of viable cells at time $t$, $N_0$ is the initial population at $t=0$, and $D$ is the $D$-value at the given temperature.\n\nWe can analyze the provided data for the isothermal hold at $T = 62\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$:\n- At $t_0 = 0$ min, the viable count is $N_0 = 10^{7}$ CFU/g.\n- At $t_1 = 6$ min, the viable count is $N_1 = 10^{6}$ CFU/g.\n\nThe number of log reductions over this interval is:\n$$ \\Delta(\\log_{10}N) = \\log_{10}(N_0) - \\log_{10}(N_1) = \\log_{10}(10^7) - \\log_{10}(10^6) = 7 - 6 = 1 $$\nThe time elapsed for this $1$-log reduction is $\\Delta t = t_1 - t_0 = 6 - 0 = 6$ min.\nBy its definition, the $D$-value is the time required for a $1$-log reduction. Therefore, the $D$-value at $62\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ is:\n$$ D_{62} = 6 \\, \\text{min} $$\nThis is confirmed by the subsequent data points. For instance, between $t_1 = 6$ min and $t_2 = 12$ min, the count drops from $10^6$ to $10^5$ (another $1$-log reduction) in a time interval of $12 - 6 = 6$ min. The provided data are perfectly consistent with a constant $D$-value.\n\n**2. Calculation of the $z$-value**\n\nThe $z$-value is the temperature change required to alter the $D$-value by a factor of ten. To calculate the $z$-value, we first need to determine the $D$-value at the second temperature, $T = 68\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nUsing the data for the isothermal hold at $T = 68\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$:\n- At $t_0 = 0$ min, the viable count is $N_0 = 10^{7}$ CFU/g.\n- At $t_1 = 0.7$ min, the viable count is $N_1 = 10^{6}$ CFU/g.\n\nThe number of log reductions is:\n$$ \\Delta(\\log_{10}N) = \\log_{10}(10^7) - \\log_{10}(10^6) = 7 - 6 = 1 $$\nThe time elapsed for this $1$-log reduction is $\\Delta t = t_1 - t_0 = 0.7 - 0 = 0.7$ min.\nTherefore, the $D$-value at $68\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ is:\n$$ D_{68} = 0.7 \\, \\text{min} $$\nAgain, the subsequent data points confirm this value.\n\nThe mathematical relationship between the $D$-value, temperature, and the $z$-value is given by:\n$$ \\log_{10}(D_2) - \\log_{10}(D_1) = -\\frac{T_2 - T_1}{z} $$\nRearranging to solve for the $z$-value:\n$$ z = - \\frac{T_2 - T_1}{\\log_{10}(D_2) - \\log_{10}(D_1)} = \\frac{T_2 - T_1}{\\log_{10}(D_1) - \\log_{10}(D_2)} = \\frac{T_2 - T_1}{\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{D_1}{D_2}\\right)} $$\nWe have the following values:\n- $T_1 = 62\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n- $D_1 = D_{62} = 6$ min\n- $T_2 = 68\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n- $D_2 = D_{68} = 0.7$ min\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for $z$:\n$$ z = \\frac{68 - 62}{\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{6}{0.7}\\right)} = \\frac{6}{\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{60}{7}\\right)} $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ z = \\frac{6}{\\log_{10}(8.571428...)} \\approx \\frac{6}{0.93305} \\approx 6.43051 \\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the results to be rounded to three significant figures.\nThe $D$-value at $62\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ is $D_{62} = 6.00$ min.\nThe $z$-value is $z \\approx 6.43 \\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nThe final answers are $6.00$ min for the $D$-value at $62\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and $6.43 \\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ for the $z$-value.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n6.00  6.43\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4647183"}, {"introduction": "Once ingested, the virulence of *Listeria monocytogenes* depends on its ability to invade host cells, a process mediated by surface proteins like Internalin A (InlA).

Thinking through this scenario builds skills in connecting molecular-level changes, such as the binding affinity between a protein and its receptor, to the overall pathogenesis of an infection.", "problem": "A foodborne pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes, invades human intestinal epithelium and the placenta using surface proteins called internalins, notably Internalin A (InlA) and Internalin B (InlB). InlA specifically binds Epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) on human epithelial cells, while InlB binds the Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor (HGFR, c-Met) on various cell types. Consider the following principles as a fundamental base: receptor–ligand binding follows mass-action kinetics, the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology states that a gene encodes a protein whose function depends on its sequence and structure, and epithelial invasion requires specific adhesion to host receptors to initiate internalization. Let the fraction of receptor sites occupied by a bacterial adhesin be $f = \\dfrac{[L]}{[L] + K_d}$, where $[L]$ is the effective local concentration of the adhesin at the host surface and $K_d$ is the dissociation constant. The instantaneous epithelial invasion rate $r$ is proportional to the occupied fraction $f$, so that lower $f$ decreases $r$. Placental invasion in humans has been shown to require synergistic engagement of E-cadherin by InlA and c-Met by InlB; for simplicity, let the probability of successful placental entry per encounter scale as $p_{\\text{placenta}} \\propto f_{\\text{InlA}} \\cdot f_{\\text{InlB}}$. Maternal-fetal transmission risk then scales with systemic bacteremia and placental entry, $R_{\\text{mf}} \\propto p_{\\text{bacteremia}} \\cdot p_{\\text{placenta}}$, where $p_{\\text{bacteremia}}$ is increased by efficient intestinal epithelial invasion.\n\nResearchers engineer a loss-of-function mutation in the InlA gene that abolishes measurable binding to human E-cadherin, increasing the dissociation constant effectively to $K_d^{\\text{mut}} \\to \\infty$.

The mutation will markedly reduce invasion of human intestinal and placental epithelia by disrupting E-cadherin engagement, thereby decreasing maternal-fetal transmission risk; some residual risk may persist via alternate routes such as InlB-mediated entry and phagocyte carriage, but it will be substantially lower than wild-type.\n\nB. The mutation will have negligible effect on epithelial invasion and maternal-fetal transmission because InlB fully compensates for InlA at both intestinal and placental surfaces, leaving risk unchanged.\n\nC. The mutation will increase maternal-fetal transmission by reducing host immune activation at the intestinal barrier, enabling stealth dissemination despite reduced adhesion.\n\nD. The mutation will prevent intestinal colonization but will increase placental invasion because InlB binds human E-cadherin more efficiently in the absence of InlA.\n\nE.

The role of InlA/E-cadherin and InlB/c-Met interactions in *Listeria* pathogenesis is a foundational concept. The use of a mass-action model for receptor binding and simplified proportionality relationships for complex biological outcomes (invasion, transmission) are standard and valid modeling approaches in biophysics and systems biology. The provided constants ($K_d$, $[L]$) are within a realistic order of magnitude for protein-protein interactions. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear initial state (wild-type), a defined perturbation (InlA mutation), a set of mathematical and biological principles, and asks for a logical prediction. The information is sufficient to determine the consequences of the mutation within the given framework. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution can be derived.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language. It presents a scientific model and asks for its logical consequences, free of subjective or value-laden statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the invalidating flaws listed (e.g., factual unsoundness, contradiction, ambiguity). The setup is a valid, formalizable scientific question.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires predicting the effect of an InlA loss-of-function mutation. The core of the analysis rests on how this mutation affects the fractional occupancy of E-cadherin by InlA, represented by $f_{\\text{InlA}}$, and the cascading consequences on invasion and transmission as defined by the provided models.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Fractional Occupancy of E-cadherin by InlA ($f_{\\text{InlA}}$)**\n\n    The fractional occupancy is given by the equation $f = \\dfrac{[L]}{[L] + K_d}$.\n\n    For the **wild-type (WT)** pathogen, we are given $K_d^{\\text{WT}} \\approx 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{M}$ and $[L] \\approx 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{M}$.\n    $$f_{\\text{InlA}}^{\\text{WT}} = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_d^{\\text{WT}}} \\approx \\frac{10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{M}}{10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{M} + 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{10 \\times 10^{-8}}{10 \\times 10^{-8} + 1 \\times 10^{-8}} = \\frac{10}{11} \\approx 0.91$$\n    This high fractional occupancy ($ 90\\%$) indicates that wild-type InlA binds very effectively to human E-cadherin under these conditions.\n\n    For the **mutant** pathogen, the loss-of-function mutation results in $K_d^{\\text{mut}} \\to \\infty$.\n    $$f_{\\text{InlA}}^{\\text{mut}} = \\lim_{K_d \\to \\infty} \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_d}$$\n    As the denominator approaches infinity while the numerator remains finite, the fraction approaches zero.\n    $$f_{\\text{InlA}}^{\\text{mut}} \\to 0$$\n    This confirms mathematically that the mutation effectively abolishes the binding of InlA to E-cadherin.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Effect on Intestinal Epithelial Invasion**\n\n    The problem states that intestinal invasion rate $r$ is proportional to the occupied fraction $f$ and that intestinal invasion depends on InlA binding E-cadherin. Thus, $r_{\\text{intestinal}} \\propto f_{\\text{InlA}}$.\n    -   For WT: $r_{\\text{intestinal}}^{\\text{WT}} \\propto f_{\\text{InlA}}^{\\text{WT}} \\approx \\frac{10}{11}$.\n    -   For mutant: $r_{\\text{intestinal}}^{\\text{mut}} \\propto f_{\\text{InlA}}^{\\text{mut}} \\to 0$.\n    Since $f_{\\text{InlA}}$ drops from a high value to near zero, the rate of intestinal invasion will be **markedly reduced**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Effect on Bacteremia ($p_{\\text{bacteremia}}$)**\n\n    The premise is that $p_{\\text{bacteremia}}$ is increased by efficient intestinal epithelial invasion. Since the mutant exhibits a markedly reduced rate of intestinal invasion, it follows directly that the probability of establishing systemic bacteremia, $p_{\\text{bacteremia}}$, will be **substantially decreased** for the mutant compared to the wild-type.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Effect on Placental Invasion ($p_{\\text{placenta}}$)**\n\n    The model for placental invasion is multiplicative: $p_{\\text{placenta}} \\propto f_{\\text{InlA}} \\cdot f_{\\text{InlB}}$. We are given that $f_{\\text{InlB}}$ remains high and is unaffected by the mutation. Let's denote this constant high value as $C$. So, $p_{\\text{placenta}} \\propto f_{\\text{InlA}} \\cdot C$.\n    -   For WT: $p_{\\text{placenta}}^{\\text{WT}} \\propto f_{\\text{InlA}}^{\\text{WT}} \\cdot C \\approx \\frac{10}{11} \\cdot C$.\n    -   For mutant: $p_{\\text{placenta}}^{\\text{mut}} \\propto f_{\\text{InlA}}^{\\text{mut}} \\cdot C \\to 0 \\cdot C = 0$.\n    The multiplicative nature of this model means that the loss of the InlA binding component ($f_{\\text{InlA}} \\to 0$) drives the entire probability of placental invasion to near zero, even if InlB function is perfectly preserved. Thus, placental invasion is also **markedly reduced**.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Effect on Maternal-Fetal Transmission Risk ($R_{\\text{mf}}$)**\n\n    The overall risk is given by $R_{\\text{mf}} \\propto p_{\\text{bacteremia}} \\cdot p_{\\text{placenta}}$.\n    We have established that for the mutant, both $p_{\\text{bacteremia}}$ (due to failed intestinal invasion) and $p_{\\text{placenta}}$ (due to the requirement for InlA in the synergistic binding model) are markedly reduced compared to the wild-type. The product of two greatly diminished terms will be extremely small. Therefore, the maternal-fetal transmission risk, $R_{\\text{mf}}$, will be **substantially decreased**.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow I will evaluate each option based on the derivation above.\n\n**A. The mutation will markedly reduce invasion of human intestinal and placental epithelia by disrupting E-cadherin engagement, thereby decreasing maternal-fetal transmission risk; some residual risk may persist via alternate routes such as InlB-mediated entry and phagocyte carriage, but it will be substantially lower than wild-type.**\n-   This option correctly states that invasion of both intestinal and placental epithelia will be markedly reduced due to the disruption of E-cadherin engagement. This is a direct consequence of $f_{\\text{InlA}} \\to 0$.\n-   It correctly concludes that this will decrease maternal-fetal transmission risk.\n-   The final clause, acknowledging potential residual risk via alternate pathways not included in the simplified model (like InlB-only entry into other cell types or transport via phagocytes), is a biologically sophisticated and accurate qualification. It does not contradict the primary conclusion from the model, which is that the risk will be \"substantially lower.\" This option is a complete and accurate prediction.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The mutation will have negligible effect on epithelial invasion and maternal-fetal transmission because InlB fully compensates for InlA at both intestinal and placental surfaces, leaving risk unchanged.**\n-   This is incorrect. The model for placental invasion is $p_{\\text{placenta}} \\propto f_{\\text{InlA}} \\cdot f_{\\text{InlB}}$. In this multiplicative model, InlB cannot compensate for a zero-value $f_{\\text{InlA}}$. Furthermore, InlA is stated to be required for human intestinal epithelial invasion. Therefore, the effect is not negligible.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The mutation will increase maternal-fetal transmission by reducing host immune activation at the intestinal barrier, enabling stealth dissemination despite reduced adhesion.**\n-   This contradicts the provided framework. The problem explicitly links invasion and subsequent transmission to successful adhesion ($r \\propto f$). A drastic reduction in adhesion ($f_{\\text{InlA}} \\to 0$) must, according to the model, lead to a drastic reduction in invasion and risk. The hypothesis of \"stealth dissemination\" is not supported by the givens and contradicts the direct mechanical role of adhesion defined in the problem.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The mutation will prevent intestinal colonization but will increase placental invasion because InlB binds human E-cadherin more efficiently in the absence of InlA.**\n-   This option contains a factual error according to the problem statement. InlB binds c-Met, not E-cadherin. There is no basis to assume its binding target or efficiency changes. It also incorrectly predicts an increase in placental invasion, which contradicts the multiplicative model where one of the terms goes to zero.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. In human hosts expressing E-cadherin, InlA is dispensable for epithelial invasion; therefore, the mutation will not change placental entry or maternal-fetal transmission compared with wild-type.**\n-   This directly contradicts the premises of the problem. The relationship $r \\propto f_{\\text{InlA}}$ and the high calculated value of $f_{\\text{InlA}}^{\\text{WT}} \\approx 0.91$ demonstrate that InlA is not dispensable but is, in fact, critical for efficient invasion according to the provided model.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe only option that logically follows from the provided principles and models is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4647199"}, {"introduction": "When a listeriosis outbreak occurs, epidemiologists work to identify the source to prevent further illness.
