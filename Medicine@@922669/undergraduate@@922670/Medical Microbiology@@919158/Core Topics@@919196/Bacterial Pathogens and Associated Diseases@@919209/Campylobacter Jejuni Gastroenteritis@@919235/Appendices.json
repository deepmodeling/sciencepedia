Consider the following scenario: a $24$-year-old hiker presents with $2$ days of cramping abdominal pain, fever, and initially watery diarrhea that has become bloody. He ate undercooked poultry and unpasteurized milk at a campsite. Stool microscopy shows numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes and red blood cells. A stool Gram stain shows curved Gram-negative rods.

The clinical presentation, patient history, laboratory findings (Gram stain morphology, culture conditions, biochemical test results), and associated complications are all classic, well-documented characteristics of infectious gastroenteritis caused by *Campylobacter jejuni*. The other pathogens listed for differentiation (*Salmonella*, *Shigella*, EHEC) are appropriate differential diagnoses. The foundational principles provided are accurate summaries of core concepts in medical microbiology and pathogenesis.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a comprehensive set of data from a clinical case and asks for a specific identification based on a differential diagnosis framework. The question is structured to have a single, best answer based on the synthesis of the provided information.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem statement uses precise, objective, and standard clinical and microbiological terminology. It is free from subjective or ambiguous language.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The information is internally consistent and sufficient to arrive at a diagnosis. The findings—inflammatory diarrhea (fever, blood, leukocytes), exposure history (poultry), Gram stain (curved rods), unique culture requirements (microaerophilic, $42^\\circ\\text{C}$), biochemical profile (oxidase-positive), and specific complication risk (neuropathy)—all converge to support a single etiological agent, as described in the scenario.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-formed, scientifically accurate, and internally consistent question typical of medical microbiology examinations. The solution will proceed by analyzing the provided data in light of the foundational principles to identify the distinguishing characteristics of *Campylobacter jejuni* and then evaluating each option.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to identify the set of features that uniquely defines the pathogen described in the case, distinguishing it from *Salmonella enterica*, *Shigella* species, and EHEC.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Clinical and Epidemiological Data:** The patient presents with fever, abdominal cramps, and bloody diarrhea (dysentery). Stool microscopy confirms an inflammatory process with numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes and red blood cells. This aligns with foundational principle (ii), suggesting an invasive pathogen. This presentation can be caused by *Campylobacter*, *Salmonella*, and *Shigella*. EHEC also causes bloody diarrhea (hemorrhagic colitis) but typically with less fever and fewer fecal leukocytes, as its primary mechanism is toxin-mediated endothelial damage rather than direct epithelial invasion. The exposure history to undercooked poultry is a strong risk factor for both *Campylobacter* and *Salmonella*. Therefore, clinical presentation and epidemiology are suggestive but not solely definitive.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Microbiological Data:** This is the most crucial part for specific identification.\n    - **Gram Stain:** The observation of \"curved Gram-negative rods\" is a key differentiator. *Campylobacter* species characteristically have a curved, S-shaped, or \"gull-wing\" morphology. In contrast, *Salmonella*, *Shigella*, and *E. coli* are all straight Gram-negative rods (bacilli).\n    - **Culture Conditions:** As stated in principle (iii), these reflect ecological adaptation. The organism grows under microaerophilic conditions ($5\\%$ $O_2$, $10\\%$ $CO_2$) and at an elevated temperature ($42^\\circ\\text{C}$). This \"thermophilic\" and microaerophilic requirement is a hallmark of pathogenic *Campylobacter jejuni* and *Campylobacter coli*. This combination is highly selective, as the other pathogens listed (*Salmonella*, *Shigella*, EHEC) are facultative anaerobes that grow well in ambient air and optimally at $37^\\circ\\text{C}$. Principle (i) explains this preference, as *Campylobacter* has a respiratory chain adapted for low-oxygen environments and lacks robust defenses against oxidative stress present in ambient air.\n    - **Biochemical Tests:** The colonies are oxidase positive. This is a definitive test that separates *Campylobacter* from the Enterobacteriaceae family, to which *Salmonella*, *Shigella*, and *E. coli* belong. All members of Enterobacteriaceae are oxidase negative. The positive hippurate hydrolysis test is used to further speciate within the genus *Campylobacter*, and is a key feature of *C. jejuni*.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Complications:** The counseling about \"post-infectious neuropathic risk\" is a direct reference to Guillain–Barré Syndrome (GBS). *C. jejuni* infection is the most common identified antecedent to GBS, occurring due to molecular mimicry between the bacterial lipooligosaccharides and human nerve gangliosides. This association is a well-recognized and specific feature distinguishing *C. jejuni* from the other listed pathogens, whose primary post-infectious complications are different (e.g., Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS) for EHEC, reactive arthritis for *Salmonella* and *Shigella*).\n\n**Synthesis:** The constellation of features that most specifically identifies the pathogen as *Campylobacter jejuni* and distinguishes it from *Salmonella*, *Shigella*, and EHEC is: the curved Gram-negative rod morphology, the unique growth requirements (microaerophilic at $42^\\circ\\text{C}$), the positive oxidase test, the positive hippurate hydrolysis test, and the association with GBS.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Straight Gram-negative rods that are non-sorbitol fermenting on sorbitol-MacConkey medium, cause hemorrhagic colitis with minimal fever and few fecal leukocytes, frequently complicated by Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS), growing at $37^\\circ\\text{C}$ in ambient air.**\n- This option describes Enterohemorrhagic *Escherichia coli* (EHEC), specifically the common serotype O157:H7. The rod shape, growth conditions, lack of sorbitol fermentation, clinical syndrome (hemorrhagic colitis with minimal inflammation), and complication (HUS) are all characteristic of EHEC. This directly contradicts the findings in the problem statement (curved rods, inflammatory diarrhea, growth at $42^\\circ\\text{C}$).\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Motile Gram-negative bacilli that produce hydrogen sulfide ($\\text{H}_2\\text{S}$) on triple sugar iron (TSI) agar, grow at $37^\\circ\\text{C}$ under aerobic conditions, commonly associated with bacteremia and exposure to pet reptiles or eggs.**\n- This option describes a typical non-typhoidal *Salmonella enterica* serovar. The motility, production of $\\text{H}_2\\text{S}$ gas, standard growth conditions, and association with reptiles and eggs are classic features. This contradicts the case's findings of curved rods, microaerophilic growth at $42^\\circ\\text{C}$, and a positive oxidase test (*Salmonella* is oxidase-negative and does not typically require microaerophilic conditions).\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Nonmotile Gram-negative bacilli with a human-only reservoir, extremely low median infectious dose ($\\mathrm{ID}_{50}$) of less than $100$ organisms, causing febrile dysentery with tenesmus by invasion through intestinal M cells.**\n- This option describes *Shigella* species. Non-motility, a low infectious dose, human-only reservoir, and invasion of M cells are defining features of shigellosis. This contradicts the case's findings of curved rods, specific culture requirements, and positive oxidase test (*Shigella* is oxidase-negative).\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Curved Gram-negative rods that are oxidase positive, grow under microaerophilic conditions with enhanced growth at $42^\\circ\\text{C}$, are hippurate hydrolysis positive, cause invasive inflammatory diarrhea with fever and fecal leukocytes and red blood cells, have a typical exposure to undercooked poultry or unpasteurized milk, and carry a recognized post-infectious risk of Guillain–Barré Syndrome.**\n- This option perfectly matches every distinctive detail provided in the problem statement and the established microbiology of *Campylobacter jejuni*. It correctly lists the unique morphology (curved rods), key biochemical test (oxidase positive), specific culture requirements (microaerophilic, $42^\\circ\\text{C}$), species-specific test (hippurate hydrolysis positive), clinical picture (inflammatory diarrhea), epidemiology (poultry), and associated complication (GBS risk). This set of features uniquely distinguishes *C. jejuni* from *Salmonella*, *Shigella*, and EHEC.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Curved Gram-negative rods requiring high salt and alkaline pH, producing profuse watery “rice-water” diarrhea via toxin-mediated chloride secretion with minimal inflammation and no fever, growing readily at $37^\\circ\\text{C}$ in ambient air.**\n- This option describes *Vibrio cholerae*. While the morphology is curved, all other features are incorrect for the case. Cholera is a non-invasive, toxin-mediated disease causing profuse watery diarrhea without significant fever or inflammation (contradicts principle (ii) for this case). *Vibrio* are halophilic (require salt), prefer alkaline pH, and grow well in ambient air at $37^\\circ\\text{C}$. This profile is inconsistent with the inflammatory dysentery and specific culture requirements described for the hiker.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "4615424"}, {"introduction": "Understanding a pathogen's physiology is key to unraveling its epidemiology.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\nThe model for exponential growth of biomass $X$ is given by the differential equation $\\frac{dX}{dt} = \\mu X$, where $\\mu$ is the constant specific growth rate. Integrating this equation from time $t_0$ to $t$ gives:\n$$ X(t) = X(t_0) e^{\\mu (t-t_0)} $$\nThe problem states that Optical Density ($\\mathrm{OD}$) is proportional to biomass ($X$), so we can write $\\mathrm{OD}(t) = kX(t)$ for some proportionality constant $k$. Substituting this into the growth equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{OD}(t)}{k} = \\frac{\\mathrm{OD}(t_0)}{k} e^{\\mu (t-t_0)} $$\nThe constant $k$ cancels, yielding:\n$$ \\mathrm{OD}(t) = \\mathrm{OD}(t_0) e^{\\mu (t-t_0)} $$\nTo solve for the specific growth rate $\\mu$, we can rearrange the equation.

Calculation for $T = 42^\\circ\\text{C}$:**\n-   $\\mathrm{OD}(t_0) = 0.05$\n-   $\\mathrm{OD}(t) = 0.40$\n-   $\\Delta t = 4\\,\\mathrm{h}$\nThe specific growth rate, $\\mu_{42}$, is:\n$$ \\mu_{42} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{0.40}{0.05}\\right)}{4\\,\\mathrm{h}} = \\frac{\\ln(8)}{4}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} $$\nSince $\\ln(8) = 3\\ln(2) \\approx 3 \\times 0.6931 = 2.0793$, we have:\n$$ \\mu_{42} \\approx \\frac{2.0793}{4}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} \\approx 0.5198\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} $$\n\n**3.

Clearly, $\\mu_{42} > \\mu_{37}$. The specific growth rate is significantly higher at $42^\\circ\\text{C}$ than at $37^\\circ\\text{C}$ (specifically, it is $1.5$ times greater).\n\nThis finding has a direct ecological implication. *C. jejuni*'s principal natural reservoir is the intestinal tract of birds, particularly poultry (chickens, turkeys). The core body temperature of birds is approximately $41-42^\\circ\\text{C}$. The bacterium's ability to grow optimally at this higher temperature is a key adaptation to its primary host environment. While it can cause disease (gastroenteritis) in humans, whose core body temperature is $37^\\circ\\text{C}$, humans are considered incidental hosts, not the primary reservoir. The faster growth at $42^\\circ\\text{C}$ supports the conclusion that the organism is adapted to an avian reservoir.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $42^\\circ\\text{C}$; growth is faster at this thermophilic optimum, aligning with avian core body temperature near $41-42^\\circ\\text{C}$, consistent with poultry serving as major asymptomatic reservoirs.**\nThe calculation shows growth is indeed faster at $42^\\circ\\text{C}$. The term \"thermophilic\" (or more precisely, thermotolerant) is appropriate for an organism with an optimum around this temperature. This temperature aligns perfectly with the core body temperature of birds ($41-42^\\circ\\text{C}$). It is a well-established fact in medical microbiology that poultry are the major asymptomatic reservoirs for *C. jejuni*.

This premise is incorrect. Furthermore, humans are symptomatic, incidental hosts, not the primary reservoir. Finally, psychrotrophic adaptation (growth at low temperatures, e.g., $0-7^\\circ\\text{C}$) is irrelevant to the comparison of growth at $37^\\circ\\text{C}$ and $42^\\circ\\text{C}$ and is not a characteristic of *C. jejuni* (which is sensitive to cold). The statement is flawed on multiple counts.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $42^\\circ\\text{C}$; growth is faster because high oxygen tension at this temperature mimics avian lung physiology, which selects for oxidative metabolism in the gut.**\nWhile the growth is faster at $42^\\circ\\text{C}$, the rationale is scientifically incorrect. *C. jejuni* is a microaerophilic organism, meaning it requires *low* oxygen tension for growth and is inhibited by atmospheric (high) oxygen levels. The ecological niche is the gut, which is a low-oxygen environment, not the lungs. This statement incorrectly links the organism to the wrong physiological system (lungs vs. gut) and mischaracterizes its oxygen requirements.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Both temperatures yield similar maximal growth; the reservoir linkage cannot be inferred from temperature dependence, which is too small to be biologically meaningful.**\nThe calculated specific growth rate at $42^\\circ\\text{C}$ ($0.5198\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$) is $50\\%$ higher than at $37^\\circ\\text{C}$ ($0.3466\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$). This corresponds to a doubling time of approximately $1.33\\,\\mathrm{h}$ at $42^\\circ\\text{C}$ versus $2.00\\,\\mathrm{h}$ at $37^\\circ\\text{C}$. A $50\\%$ increase in growth rate is a very large and biologically significant difference, conferring a substantial competitive advantage.

According to Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(S=P \\mid G=g) = \\frac{P(G=g \\mid S=P) P(S=P)}{P(G=g)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(G=g)$, is the marginal probability of observing genotype $g$, which is found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(G=g) = P(G=g \\mid S=P)P(S=P) + P(G=g \\mid S=R)P(S=R)$$\nSubstituting the given notation:\n$$P(G=g) = f_{P}(g)\\pi_{P} + f_{R}(g)\\pi_{R}$$\nSo, the posterior probability is:\n$$P(S=P \\mid G=g) = \\frac{f_{P}(g)\\pi_{P}}{f_{P}(g)\\pi_{P} + f_{R}(g)\\pi_{R}}$$\n\nWe now apply this formula to each of the three observed genotypes.\n\nCase 1: Observed genotype is $g_{1}$.\nThe posterior probability that the source is poultry is:\n$$P(S=P \\mid G=g_{1}) = \\frac{f_{P}(g_{1})\\pi_{P}}{f_{P}(g_{1})\\pi_{P} + f_{R}(g_{1})\\pi_{R}}$$\n$$P(S=P \\mid G=g_{1}) = \\frac{(0.50)(0.6)}{(0.50)(0.6) + (0.10)(0.4)} = \\frac{0.30}{0.30 + 0.04} = \\frac{0.30}{0.34} = \\frac{15}{17}$$\n\nCase 2: Observed genotype is $g_{2}$.\nThe posterior probability that the source is poultry is:\n$$P(S=P \\mid G=g_{2}) = \\frac{f_{P}(g_{2})\\pi_{P}}{f_{P}(g_{2})\\pi_{P} + f_{R}(g_{2})\\pi_{R}}$$\n$$P(S=P \\mid G=g_{2}) = \\frac{(0.30)(0.6)}{(0.30)(0.6) + (0.45)(0.4)} = \\frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.18} = \\frac{0.18}{0.36} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nCase 3: Observed genotype is $g_{3}$.\nThe posterior probability that the source is poultry is:\n$$P(S=P \\mid G=g_{3}) = \\frac{f_{P}(g_{3})\\pi_{P}}{f_{P}(g_{3})\\pi_{P} + f_{R}(g_{3})\\pi_{R}}$$\n$$P(S=P \\mid G=g_{3}) = \\frac{(0.20)(0.6)}{(0.20)(0.6) + (0.45)(0.4)} = \\frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.18} = \\frac{0.12}{0.30} = \\frac{12}{30} = \\frac{2}{5}$$\n\nThe second step is to compute the expected number of cases attributable to poultry. Let $X_{i}$ be an indicator random variable for the $i$-th case, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. We define $X_{i}=1$ if case $i$ is from the poultry source and $X_{i}=0$ otherwise. The expected value of an indicator variable is the probability of the event it indicates.\nFor case $1$ (genotype $g_{1}$), the probability of being from poultry is $P(S=P \\mid G=g_{1})$. Thus, the expected value is:\n$$E[X_{1}] = 1 \\cdot P(S=P \\mid G=g_{1}) + 0 \\cdot P(S \\neq P \\mid G=g_{1}) = P(S=P \\mid G=g_{1}) = \\frac{15}{17}$$\nSimilarly, for case $2$ (genotype $g_{2}$) and case $3$ (genotype $g_{3}$):\n$$E[X_{2}] = P(S=P \\mid G=g_{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$E[X_{3}] = P(S=P \\mid G=g_{3}) = \\frac{2}{5}$$\n\nThe total number of cases attributable to poultry is $N_{P} = X_{1} + X_{2} + X_{3}$. By the linearity of expectation, the expected total number is the sum of the individual expected values:\n$$E[N_{P}] = E[X_{1} + X_{2} + X_{3}] = E[X_{1}] + E[X_{2}] + E[X_{3}]$$\nThe independence of the cases ensures that the attribution probability for one case is not affected by the others.\n$$E[N_{P}] = \\frac{15}{17} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{5}$$\nTo sum these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $17 \\times 2 \\times 5 = 170$:\n$$E[N_{P}] = \\frac{15 \\times 10}{17 \\times 10} + \\frac{1 \\times 85}{2 \\times 85} + \\frac{2 \\times 34}{5 \\times 34} = \\frac{150}{170} + \\frac{85}{170} + \\frac{68}{170}$$\n$$E[N_{P}] = \\frac{150 + 85 + 68}{170} = \\frac{303}{170}$$\nNow, we convert this fraction to a decimal and round to four significant figures as requested.\n$$E[N_{P}] = \\frac{303}{170} \\approx 1.7823529...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $1.782$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.782}$$", "id": "4615394"}]}
