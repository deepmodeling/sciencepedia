While non-invasive tests like the stool antigen assay are common, interpreting their results requires a nuanced understanding of their performance characteristics.

We can therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe objective is to determine the post-test probability of a patient having an active *Helicobacter pylori* infection given a positive test result. This is a classic application of Bayes' theorem for probabilistic updating.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $I$: The event that the patient has an active *H. pylori* infection.\n- $I^c$: The event that the patient does not have an active *H. pylori* infection.\n- $T^+$: The event that the stool antigen assay yields a positive result.\n- $T^-$: The event that the stool antigen assay yields a negative result.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n1. The pretest probability of infection: $P(I) = 0.40$. This is the clinician's initial estimate of the probability of disease before the test is performed.\n2. The sensitivity of the assay: $P(T^+ | I) = 0.92$. This is the conditional probability that the test is positive, given that the patient has the infection (true positive rate).\n3. The specificity of the assay: $P(T^- | I^c) = 0.90$. This is the conditional probability that the test is negative, given that the patient does not have the infection (true negative rate).\n\nOur goal is to compute the post-test probability of infection, which is the conditional probability $P(I | T^+)$.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, the post-test probability is given by:\n$$\nP(I | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | I) P(I)}{P(T^+)}\n$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, which marginalizes over the two possible states of the patient (infected or not infected):\n$$\nP(T^+) = P(T^+ | I) P(I) + P(T^+ | I^c) P(I^c)\n$$\n\nThis expression represents the sum of the probabilities of two mutually exclusive events: a true positive result ($T^+$ and $I$) and a false positive result ($T^+$ and $I^c$).\n\nWe have been given $P(I)$, $P(T^+ | I)$, and the specificity $P(T^- | I^c)$. We can derive the remaining required terms:\n\nFirst, the probability that the patient does not have the infection is the complement of the pretest probability:\n$$\nP(I^c) = 1 - P(I) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60\n$$\n\nNext, we need the probability of a false positive, $P(T^+ | I^c)$. This is the conditional probability that the test is positive, given that the patient does not have the infection. Specificity, $P(T^- | I^c)$, is the probability of a true negative. Since a patient without the infection can only test positive or negative, these two probabilities must sum to $1$:\n$$\nP(T^+ | I^c) + P(T^- | I^c) = 1\n$$\nTherefore, the false positive rate is:\n$$\nP(T^+ | I^c) = 1 - P(T^- | I^c) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10\n$$\n\nNow we can compute the total probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$:\n$$\nP(T^+) = P(T^+ | I) P(I) + P(T^+ | I^c) P(I^c)\n$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$\nP(T^+) = (0.92)(0.40) + (0.10)(0.60)\n$$\n$$\nP(T^+) = 0.368 + 0.060 = 0.428\n$$\n\nFinally, we substitute all the components back into Bayes' theorem to find the post-test probability, $P(I | T^+)$:\n$$\nP(I | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | I) P(I)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{(0.92)(0.40)}{0.428} = \\frac{0.368}{0.428}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\nP(I | T^+) \\approx 0.859813084...\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nP(I | T^+) \\approx 0.8598\n$$\nThus, after the positive stool antigen assay, the probability of the patient having an active *H. pylori* infection has increased from $40\\%$ to approximately $86\\%$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.8598}\n$$", "id": "4636104"}, {"introduction": "Effective treatment of *H. pylori* is increasingly threatened by antibiotic resistance.
