This practice is essential for understanding the real-world impact of a diagnostic test on patient management.", "problem": "A clinician evaluates an otherwise healthy $25$-year-old outpatient with community-acquired pneumonia presenting with a dry cough, low-grade fever, and diffuse interstitial infiltrates on chest radiograph. The clinician suspects atypical pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae. She considers ordering a multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. From local surveillance data, the pretest probability (prevalence among similar patients) is $p = 0.15$. The NAAT has sensitivity $Se = 0.92$ and specificity $Sp = 0.97$.\n\nThe clinician uses a probability-based treatment threshold: she would prescribe a macrolide antibiotic if and only if her estimated probability that the patient has Mycoplasma pneumoniae exceeds $\\tau = 0.25$. Without testing, she would compare the pretest probability $p$ to $\\tau$. With testing, she would compare the appropriate post-test probability to $\\tau$ based on a positive or a negative NAAT result.\n\nUsing only the foundational definitions of sensitivity ($Se$), specificity ($Sp$), prevalence ($p$), Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), and Bayes’ theorem relating pretest and post-test probabilities, do the following:\n\n1. Compute the Positive Predictive Value $PPV = P(\\text{disease} \\mid \\text{test} +)$ and the Negative Predictive Value $NPV = P(\\text{no disease} \\mid \\text{test} -)$. Round $PPV$ and $NPV$ to four significant figures.\n2. Determine whether, under this threshold policy, testing can change management relative to not testing. Specifically, because $p$ is compared to $\\tau$ in the absence of testing, testing changes management if a test result would cross the threshold $\\tau$ relative to the pretest decision.\n3.

The scenario is realistic, and the provided values for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence are plausible for the described test and clinical context. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data ($p, Se, Sp, \\tau$) to answer the questions posed. The language is objective and unambiguous. The problem is mathematically and logically self-contained and consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has the disease (*Mycoplasma pneumoniae*), and let $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have the disease. Let $T+$ and $T-$ be the events of a positive and negative test result, respectively.\n\nThe givens are:\n- Pretest probability: $P(D) = p = 0.15$\n- Sensitivity: $P(T+ \\mid D) = Se = 0.92$\n- Specificity: $P(T- \\mid D^c) = Sp = 0.97$\n- Treatment threshold: $\\tau = 0.25$\n\nFrom these, we can derive the complementary probabilities:\n- Probability of not having the disease: $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85$\n- False negative rate: $P(T- \\mid D) = 1 - P(T+ \\mid D) = 1 - Se = 1 - 0.92 = 0.08$\n- False positive rate: $P(T+ \\mid D^c) = 1 - P(T- \\mid D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.97 = 0.03$\n\nTo find the predictive values and analyze the decision, we first need the overall probabilities of positive and negative test results, $P(T+)$ and $P(T-)$, using the law of total probability.\n\nThe probability of a positive test result is:\n$$ P(T+) = P(T+ \\mid D)P(D) + P(T+ \\mid D^c)P(D^c) $$\n$$ P(T+) = (Se)(p) + (1-Sp)(1-p) $$\n$$ P(T+) = (0.92)(0.15) + (0.03)(0.85) = 0.138 + 0.0255 = 0.1635 $$\n\nThe probability of a negative test result is:\n$$ P(T-) = P(T- \\mid D)P(D) + P(T- \\mid D^c)P(D^c) $$\n$$ P(T-) = (1-Se)(p) + (Sp)(1-p) $$\n$$ P(T-) = (0.08)(0.15) + (0.97)(0.85) = 0.012 + 0.8245 = 0.8365 $$\nAs a check, $P(T+) + P(T-) = 0.1635 + 0.8365 = 1.0000$.\n\n### Part 1: Compute PPV and NPV\n\nThe Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$) is the probability of having the disease given a positive test, $P(D \\mid T+)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$ PPV = P(D \\mid T+) = \\frac{P(T+ \\mid D)P(D)}{P(T+)} = \\frac{(Se)(p)}{P(T+)} $$\n$$ PPV = \\frac{(0.92)(0.15)}{0.1635} = \\frac{0.138}{0.1635} \\approx 0.844036697... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $PPV \\approx 0.8440$.\n\nThe Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$) is defined in the problem as the probability of not having the disease given a negative test, $P(D^c \\mid T-)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$ NPV = P(D^c \\mid T-) = \\frac{P(T- \\mid D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T-)} = \\frac{(Sp)(1-p)}{P(T-)} $$\n$$ NPV = \\frac{(0.97)(0.85)}{0.8365} = \\frac{0.8245}{0.8365} \\approx 0.985654512... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $NPV \\approx 0.9857$.\n\n### Part 2: Determine if testing changes management\n\nThe decision rule is to treat if the probability of disease is greater than the threshold $\\tau = 0.25$.\n\n- **Decision without testing**: Compare the pretest probability $p$ to $\\tau$.\n  Since $p = 0.15 \\le \\tau = 0.25$, the decision without testing is **not to treat**.\n\n- **Decision with testing**:\n  - If the test is positive, the probability of disease is $P(D \\mid T+) = PPV \\approx 0.8440$. Since $0.8440 > \\tau = 0.25$, the decision is **to treat**. This represents a change in management from the pretest decision.\n  - If the test is negative, the probability of disease is $P(D \\mid T-)$. We can find this as $1 - P(D^c \\mid T-) = 1 - NPV$.\n  $$ P(D \\mid T-) = 1 - NPV \\approx 1 - 0.98565... \\approx 0.01435 $$\n  Since $P(D \\mid T-) \\approx 0.01435 \\le \\tau = 0.25$, the decision is **not to treat**. This represents no change in management from the pretest decision.\n\nConclusion: Testing can change management. Specifically, a positive test result changes the decision from \"not to treat\" to \"to treat\", while a negative test result does not change the decision.\n\n### Part 3: Compute $\\Pi$, the probability that management changes\n\nThe quantity $\\Pi$ is the probability that ordering the test leads to a different decision than the pretest decision.\n\nFrom Part $2$, we established:\n- Pretest decision: Do not treat.\n- Post-test decision (if positive): Treat. (Change)\n- Post-test decision (if negative): Do not treat. (No change)\n\nManagement changes if and only if the test result is positive. Therefore, the probability that management changes, $\\Pi$, is equal to the probability of obtaining a positive test result, $P(T+)$.\n\n$$ \\Pi = P(\\text{management changes}) = P(T+) $$\nWe previously calculated $P(T+)$:\n$$ \\Pi = P(T+) = 0.1635 $$\n\nThe problem requires this value rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.1635$ already has four significant figures.\nThus, the final answer is $0.1635$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1635}$$", "id": "4656409"}, {"introduction": "This practice introduces the elegant odds-likelihood ratio formulation of Bayes' theorem, a cornerstone of evidence-based medicine.

Your final numeric answer should be only the computed posttest probability as instructed above.", "solution": "The objective is to compute the posttest probability of a *Mycoplasma pneumoniae* infection given a positive test result and to discuss this result in the context of clinical decision-making. The problem specifies using the odds formulation of Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has a *Mycoplasma pneumoniae* infection, and let $T^+$ be the event that the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test is positive.\n\nThe given information is:\nThe pretest probability of infection, $P(D) = 0.25$.\nThe positive likelihood ratio of the PCR test, $LR^{+} = 18$.\n\nThe problem requires starting from Bayes' theorem to derive the odds formulation. Bayes' theorem states the posterior probability $P(D|T^+)$ as:\n$$ P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} $$\nSimilarly, the posterior probability of not having the disease given a positive test is:\n$$ P(D^c|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^+)} $$\nwhere $D^c$ is the complement of $D$.\n\nThe odds of an event $A$ are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring, $\\text{Odds}(A) = \\frac{P(A)}{1-P(A)}$.\nThe posttest odds of disease are the ratio of $P(D|T^+)$ to $P(D^c|T^+)$:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(D|T^+)}{P(D^c|T^+)} = \\frac{\\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}}{\\frac{P(T^+|D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^+)}} $$\nThe term $P(T^+)$ cancels, yielding:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(D|T^+) = \\left(\\frac{P(T^+|D)}{P(T^+|D^c)}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)}\\right) $$\nThe first term in the product is the definition of the positive likelihood ratio, $LR^{+} = \\frac{P(T^+|D)}{P(T^+|D^c)}$. The second term is the definition of the pretest odds, $\\text{Odds}(D) = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)}$.\nThis yields the desired odds formulation for updating evidence:\n$$ \\text{Posttest Odds} = LR^{+} \\times \\text{Pretest Odds} $$\n\nNow, we apply this formula using the given values.\nFirst, we calculate the pretest odds from the pretest probability $P(D)=0.25$:\n$$ \\text{Pretest Odds} = \\frac{P(D)}{1-P(D)} = \\frac{0.25}{1-0.25} = \\frac{0.25}{0.75} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nNext, we calculate the posttest odds using the given $LR^{+} = 18$:\n$$ \\text{Posttest Odds} = LR^{+} \\times \\text{Pretest Odds} = 18 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 6 $$\nFinally, we convert the posttest odds back into a probability. The relationship between probability $P$ and odds is $P = \\frac{\\text{Odds}}{1+\\text{Odds}}$.\nThe posttest probability $P(D|T^+)$ is:\n$$ P(D|T^+) = \\frac{\\text{Posttest Odds}}{1+\\text{Posttest Odds}} = \\frac{6}{1+6} = \\frac{6}{7} $$\nTo express this as a decimal fraction rounded to $4$ significant figures:\n$$ P(D|T^+) = \\frac{6}{7} \\approx 0.857142857... \\approx 0.8571 $$\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for a discussion on treatment decision thresholds.\nFrom first principles, a rational treatment threshold is the probability of disease, let's call it $P_t$, at which the expected utility of treating a patient is equal to the expected utility of not treating. A simplified but common model balances the expected harm of treating versus the expected harm of not treating. Let $B$ be the net benefit of treating a patient who has the disease, and let $H$ be the net harm of treating a patient who does not have the disease (i.e., harm from unnecessary treatment).\nAt the threshold probability $P_t$, the expected benefit of administering treatment must equal its expected harm.\nExpected benefit = $P_t \\times B$\nExpected harm = $(1-P_t) \\times H$\nSetting these equal defines the threshold:\n$$ P_t \\times B = (1-P_t) \\times H $$\n$$ P_t \\times B = H - P_t \\times H $$\n$$ P_t(B+H) = H $$\n$$ P_t = \\frac{H}{B+H} = \\frac{H/B}{1+H/B} $$\nThis equation shows that the treatment threshold is determined by the harm-to-benefit ratio, $\\frac{H}{B}$.\nIn the given scenario, the infection is *Mycoplasma pneumoniae*, for which there are \"clinically meaningful benefits\" to treatment (e.g., shorter duration of illness, prevention of complications). This implies a large value for $B$. Macrolide therapy has \"low-to-moderate treatment harms\" (e.g., side effects, cost, promotion of antibiotic resistance), which implies a relatively small value for $H$. Therefore, the harm-to-benefit ratio $\\frac{H}{B}$ is expected to be small. A small $\\frac{H}{B}$ ratio leads to a low treatment threshold $P_t$. For instance, if the harm of unnecessary antibiotics were considered $9$ times less significant than the benefit of treating pneumonia (i.e., $\\frac{H}{B} = \\frac{1}{9}$), the threshold would be $P_t = \\frac{1/9}{1+1/9} = 0.1$, or $10\\%$. More generally, for a condition like pneumonia, treatment thresholds are typically in the range of $0.1$ to $0.3$ ($10\\%$ to $30\\%$).\n\nOur computed posttest probability is $P(D|T^+) \\approx 0.8571$. Since $0.8571$ is substantially higher than any reasonable treatment threshold for this clinical situation (e.g., $0.8571 \\gg 0.3$), the positive PCR result provides a high degree of certainty. This would strongly support the clinical decision to initiate macrolide therapy.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0.8571} $$", "id": "4671271"}, {"introduction": "Real-world diagnosis requires synthesizing information from multiple sources, a skill this exercise is designed to build.
