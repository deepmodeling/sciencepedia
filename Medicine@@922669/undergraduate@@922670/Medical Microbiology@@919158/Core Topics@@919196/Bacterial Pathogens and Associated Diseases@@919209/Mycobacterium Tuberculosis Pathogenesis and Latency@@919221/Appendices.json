The concept of particle deposition fraction as a function of aerodynamic diameter is a standard and well-validated model in respiratory physiology and public health. The values provided for deposition fractions for $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ particles are consistent with established scientific data (e.g., ICRP models) for restful breathing.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data and a clear, unambiguous definition of the quantity to be calculated. The existence of a unique solution is guaranteed.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, quantitative terms, free from subjective language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the relative efficiency of alveolar delivery, $R$, for particles of two different diameters. Let us define the variables based on the information provided.\n\nLet $D_1$ and $D_2$ be the diameters of the two particle types:\n$$D_1 = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n$$D_2 = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n\nLet $N_{inh,1}$ and $N_{inh,2}$ be the number of inhaled particles of diameter $D_1$ and $D_2$, respectively. The problem states that these numbers are equal:\n$$N_{inh,1} = N_{inh,2}$$\nLet us denote this common number of inhaled particles by $N_{inh}$.\n$$N_{inh,1} = N_{inh,2} = N_{inh}$$\n\nThe alveolar deposition fraction, $d$, is defined as the fraction of inhaled particles that successfully reach the alveolar region. For a given particle size, the number of particles reaching the alveoli, $N_{alv}$, is related to the number of inhaled particles, $N_{inh}$, by the following equation:\n$$N_{alv} = d \\times N_{inh}$$\n\nThe problem provides the deposition fractions for the two particle sizes:\nFor particles of diameter $D_1 = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, the deposition fraction is $d_1 = 60\\% = 0.60$.\nFor particles of diameter $D_2 = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, the deposition fraction is $d_2 = 10\\% = 0.10$.\n\nLet $N_{alv,1}$ be the number of particles of diameter $D_1$ that reach the alveoli, and let $N_{alv,2}$ be the number of particles of diameter $D_2$ that reach the alveoli. Using the definition of the deposition fraction, we can write:\n$$N_{alv,1} = d_1 \\times N_{inh,1} = 0.60 \\times N_{inh}$$\n$$N_{alv,2} = d_2 \\times N_{inh,2} = 0.10 \\times N_{inh}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the relative efficiency of alveolar delivery, $R$, which is defined as the ratio of the number of $D_1$ particles reaching the alveoli to the number of $D_2$ particles reaching the alveoli.\n$$R = \\frac{N_{alv,1}}{N_{alv,2}}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $N_{alv,1}$ and $N_{alv,2}$ into the equation for $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{d_1 \\times N_{inh,1}}{d_2 \\times N_{inh,2}}$$\n\nSince $N_{inh,1} = N_{inh,2} = N_{inh}$, the term for the number of inhaled particles cancels out:\n$$R = \\frac{d_1 \\times N_{inh}}{d_2 \\times N_{inh}} = \\frac{d_1}{d_2}$$\nThis shows that the relative efficiency of delivery depends only on the ratio of the deposition fractions, given that the inhaled counts are equal.\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values for $d_1$ and $d_2$:\n$$R = \\frac{0.60}{0.10}$$\n\nPerforming the division yields the final result:\n$$R = 6$$\n\nThe result is a unitless number, as expected for a ratio of two quantities with the same units (number of particles).
