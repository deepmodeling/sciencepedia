I will now proceed with generating the solution.\nThe problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It is a well-posed problem in mathematical epidemiology, based on established principles of the SIR model and herd immunity. All necessary data are provided, and the objective is clearly defined.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum fraction $p$ of a population that must be immune to prevent sustained transmission of *Neisseria meningitidis*. This is a classic herd immunity problem. The core principle is that sustained transmission is averted when the effective reproduction number, $R_{eff}$, is less than or equal to $1$. $R_{eff}$ represents the average number of secondary cases generated by a single infectious individual in a population that is partially susceptible.\n\nFirst, we calculate the basic reproduction number, $R_0$. The problem defines $R_0$ as the expected number of secondary cases caused by a single infectious individual introduced into a fully susceptible population. In the context of the SIR model, $R_0$ is the product of the transmission rate and the average duration of infectiousness.\n\nThe per capita transmission rate, $\\beta$, is given by the product of the mean number of effective close-contact events per person per day, $c$, and the per-contact probability of transmission, $q$.\n$$\n\\beta = c \\, q\n$$\nThe recovery rate, $\\gamma$, is the reciprocal of the mean duration of carriage, $\\tau$.\n$$\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\tau}\n$$\nThe basic reproduction number, $R_0$, is the ratio of the transmission rate to the recovery rate.\n$$\nR_0 = \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} = \\frac{c \\, q}{1/\\tau} = c \\, q \\, \\tau\n$$\nWe are given the following values:\n- Mean number of effective contacts, $c = 0.5 \\text{ day}^{-1}$\n- Per-contact transmission probability, $q = 0.05$\n- Mean duration of carriage, $\\tau = 90 \\text{ days}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $R_0$:\n$$\nR_0 = (0.5)(0.05)(90) = 0.025 \\times 90 = 2.25\n$$\nThis value, $R_0 = 2.25$, means that in a completely susceptible population, a single carrier would, on average, transmit the infection to $2.25$ other individuals.\n\nNow, consider a population where a fraction $p$ is immune. The fraction of the population that remains susceptible is $s = 1 - p$. The effective reproduction number, $R_{eff}$, is the basic reproduction number scaled by the susceptible fraction of the population:\n$$\nR_{eff} = R_0 \\times s = R_0 (1-p)\n$$\nThis is because an infectious individual's contacts will only lead to a new infection if the contact is with a susceptible person, which occurs with probability $s$.\n\nTo prevent sustained transmission (i.e., to prevent an epidemic from taking off), the number of infected individuals must not increase. This requires that each infectious person, on average, passes the infection to one or fewer other people. The critical threshold condition is therefore:\n$$\nR_{eff} \\le 1\n$$\nTo find the minimum fraction $p$ required for immunity, we set $R_{eff}$ to its critical value of $1$:\n$$\nR_0(1-p) = 1\n$$\nSolving for $p$:\n$$\n1-p = \\frac{1}{R_0}\n$$\n$$\np = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}\n$$\nThis value of $p$ is known as the herd immunity threshold.
