Consider a clinic that enrolls $n = 500$ pregnant women for screening. Suppose epidemiologic surveillance establishes a true prevalence $p = 0.20$ for GBS colonization in this clinic population, and the chosen screening culture has sensitivity $s = 0.90$. Prevalence is defined as the probability that a randomly selected individual is colonized, and sensitivity is defined as the conditional probability that the test is positive given that an individual is truly colonized.

The concepts of prevalence, sensitivity, and screening are standard and well-defined. The numerical values provided ($p=0.20$, $s=0.90$) are realistic for *Streptococcus agalactiae* screening. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and assumptions (e.g., independence, specificity of $1$) to construct a solvable probabilistic model. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles of mathematics or science, is formalizable, complete, and internally consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the fundamental definitions of probability and expectation for Bernoulli trials.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the expected number of truly colonized women, which we denote as $E[C_{\\text{true}}]$.\nLet $X_i$ be an indicator random variable for the $i$-th woman in the cohort, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. We define $X_i = 1$ if the $i$-th woman is truly colonized with GBS, and $X_i = 0$ if she is not.\nThe problem states that the prevalence of colonization is $p$. This is the probability that a randomly selected woman is colonized. Therefore, for any woman $i$:\n$$P(X_i = 1) = p$$\n$$P(X_i = 0) = 1 - p$$\nEach $X_i$ is a Bernoulli-distributed random variable with parameter $p$. The expectation of a single such variable is:\n$$E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot P(X_i = 1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_i = 0) = 1 \\cdot p + 0 \\cdot (1-p) = p$$\nThe total number of truly colonized women in the sample of size $n$, denoted by the random variable $C_{\\text{true}}$, is the sum of these individual indicator variables:\n$$C_{\\text{true}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected number of truly colonized women is the sum of the individual expectations. Since the women's colonization statuses are independent, this property holds.\n$$E[C_{\\text{true}}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_i]$$\nAs $E[X_i] = p$ for all $i$, we have:\n$$E[C_{\\text{true}}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p = np$$\nThis is the first required expression.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the expected number of colonized women detected by the screening, denoted $E[C_{\\text{detected}}]$.\nLet $D_i$ be an indicator random variable such that $D_i = 1$ if the $i$-th woman is detected as being colonized (i.e., her test is positive), and $D_i=0$ otherwise.\nTo find the expectation $E[D_i]$, we must find the probability $P(D_i=1)$. A woman is detected if her test result is positive. We use the law of total probability, conditioning on the true colonization status. Let $C_i$ represent the event that woman $i$ is colonized, and $\\neg C_i$ the event she is not. Let $T_i^+$ be the event her test is positive.\n$$P(D_i=1) = P(T_i^+) = P(T_i^+ | C_i)P(C_i) + P(T_i^+ | \\neg C_i)P(\\neg C_i)$$\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n- The prevalence, $P(C_i) = p$. Consequently, $P(\\neg C_i) = 1-p$.\n- The sensitivity, $P(T_i^+ | C_i) = s$.\n- The specificity is $1$, which means the false positive rate is $0$. Thus, $P(T_i^+ | \\neg C_i) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these definitions into the equation for $P(D_i=1)$:\n$$P(D_i=1) = (s)(p) + (0)(1-p) = sp$$\nSo, $D_i$ is a Bernoulli-distributed random variable with parameter $sp$. The expectation of $D_i$ is:\n$$E[D_i] = sp$$\nThe total number of detected colonized women, $C_{\\text{detected}}$, is the sum of these indicator variables:\n$$C_{\\text{detected}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} D_i$$\nThe independence of colonization status and the conditional independence of detection imply that the events $D_i$ are independent. Using the linearity of expectation again:\n$$E[C_{\\text{detected}}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} D_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[D_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} sp = nsp$$\nThis is the second required expression.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical values using the given data: $n = 500$, $p = 0.20$, and $s = 0.90$.\n\nExpected number of truly colonized women:\n$$E[C_{\\text{true}}] = np = 500 \\times 0.20 = 100$$\nExpected number of detected colonized women:\n$$E[C_{\\text{detected}}] = nsp = 500 \\times 0.20 \\times 0.90 = 100 \\times 0.90 = 90$$\n\nThe final answer is to be reported as a two-entry row matrix with the values for the expected number of truly colonized women and detected colonized women, in that order.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 100  90 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4678141"}, {"introduction": "While sensitivity and specificity describe a test's intrinsic capabilities, their clinical utility depends on the population in which they are used.

The PPV is defined as the probability that a patient is truly colonized given that they have tested positive.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $D+$: The event that a patient is truly colonized with *Streptococcus agalactiae*.\n- $D-$: The event that a patient is not colonized.\n- $T+$: The event that the NAAT result is positive.\n- $T-$: The event that the NAAT result is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n- The prevalence of colonization, which is the prior probability of a randomly selected patient being colonized: $P(D+) = 0.20$.\n- The sensitivity of the test, which is the probability of a positive test given that the patient is colonized: $P(T+|D+) = 0.95$.\n- The specificity of the test, which is the probability of a negative test given that the patient is not colonized: $P(T-|D-) = 0.97$.\n\nFrom these initial probabilities, we can deduce two other essential probabilities:\n- The probability of a patient not being colonized is the complement of the prevalence: $P(D-) = 1 - P(D+) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\n- The probability of a false positive, which is the probability of a positive test given that the patient is not colonized. This is the complement of the specificity: $P(T+|D-) = 1 - P(T-|D-) = 1 - 0.97 = 0.03$.\n\nThe goal is to compute the Positive Predictive Value, $P(D+|T+)$. According to the core definition of conditional probability, this is given by:\n$$P(D+|T+) = \\frac{P(D+ \\cap T+)}{P(T+)}$$\nwhere $P(D+ \\cap T+)$ is the joint probability of a patient being colonized and testing positive, and $P(T+)$ is the overall probability of any patient testing positive.\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator, $P(D+ \\cap T+)$. This is the probability of a true positive result. Using the definition of conditional probability, $P(T+|D+) = \\frac{P(D+ \\cap T+)}{P(D+)}$, we can rearrange it to find the joint probability:\n$$P(D+ \\cap T+) = P(T+|D+) \\times P(D+)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(D+ \\cap T+) = 0.95 \\times 0.20 = 0.19$$\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator, $P(T+)$. A positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive ways: a true positive (the patient is colonized and tests positive) or a false positive (the patient is not colonized but tests positive). We can express the total probability of a positive test using the Law of Total Probability:\n$$P(T+) = P(T+ \\cap D+) + P(T+ \\cap D-)$$\nWe have already calculated the first term, $P(T+ \\cap D+) = 0.19$. We now calculate the second term, which is the probability of a false positive, $P(T+ \\cap D-)$. Using the same logic as for the true positives:\n$$P(T+ \\cap D-) = P(T+|D-) \\times P(D-)$$\nSubstituting the values we have:\n$$P(T+ \\cap D-) = 0.03 \\times 0.80 = 0.024$$\nNow, we sum these to find the total probability of a positive test:\n$$P(T+) = 0.19 + 0.024 = 0.214$$\n\nFinally, we can compute the PPV, $P(D+|T+)$, by substituting the values for the numerator and denominator into our original formula:\n$$P(D+|T+) = \\frac{P(D+ \\cap T+)}{P(T+)} = \\frac{0.19}{0.214}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$P(D+|T+) \\approx 0.887850467...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.

The Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion method establishes antibiotic diffusion from a point source into a lawn of bacteria, creating a concentration gradient; bacterial growth is inhibited where the local antibiotic concentration exceeds the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), producing a measurable zone of inhibition whose diameter correlates inversely with MIC. The laboratory also performs the disk approximation test (D-test), which places an erythromycin disk and a clindamycin disk at a standard center-to-center distance so that the macrolide’s local concentration can induce expression of resistance mechanisms in proximity to the clindamycin disk if such mechanisms are inducible. Macrolides and lincosamides both target the bacterial $50\\mathrm{S}$ ribosomal subunit; the erythromycin ribosome methylase (erm) genes encode a methyltransferase that methylates the $23\\mathrm{S}$ ribosomal RNA, reducing binding of macrolides and lincosamides. Many erm genes in Gram-positive cocci are inducible by macrolides, which means that exposure to a macrolide can trigger expression of methyltransferase activity and confer resistance to lincosamides only in the induced region—characteristically flattening the clindamycin inhibition zone adjacent to the erythromycin disk into a “D-shape.”\n\nUnder Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) conditions for the D-test (disks placed center-to-center at $20\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ within the permissible $15$–$26\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ range), an erythromycin disk (content $15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$) and a clindamycin disk (content $2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$) are applied to a standardized inoculum ($0.5$ McFarland) of the Streptococcus agalactiae isolate.

Antibiotics diffuse from a disk, creating a concentration gradient. Inhibition occurs where the antibiotic concentration exceeds the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). Zone diameter is inversely correlated with MIC.\n    2.  The D-test places an erythromycin disk and a clindamycin disk in proximity to test for inducible resistance.\n    3.  Macrolides (e.g., erythromycin) and lincosamides (e.g., clindamycin) target the bacterial $50\\mathrm{S}$ ribosomal subunit.\n    4.  `erm` genes encode a methyltransferase that methylates the $23\\mathrm{S}$ ribosomal RNA (rRNA), reducing the binding affinity for both macrolides and lincosamides.\n    5.  Many `erm` genes are inducible by macrolides, meaning macrolide exposure triggers the expression of the resistance-conferring methyltransferase.\n    6.  The characteristic sign of inducible `erm`-mediated resistance is a \"D-shape\" flattening of the clindamycin inhibition zone adjacent to the erythromycin disk.\n- **Test Conditions:**\n    - Disk spacing (center-to-center): $20\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    - Erythromycin disk content: $15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$.\n    - Clindamycin disk content: $2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$.\n    - Inoculum: $0.5$ McFarland standard.\n    - Incubation: $18$–$24$ hours at $35$–$37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n- **Observed Results:**\n    - Erythromycin zone diameter: $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    - Clindamycin zone diameter: $18\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    - D-test morphology: \"visible flattening of the clindamycin zone on the side facing the erythromycin disk.\"\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated for validity.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The description of the Kirby-Bauer method, disk diffusion principles, the mechanism of action of macrolides and lincosamides, the `erm` gene-mediated resistance mechanism (ribosomal methylation), and the concept of inducible resistance are all fundamental and accurate principles in medical microbiology.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear set of observations and a framework of principles. It asks for a specific interpretation based on these inputs. A single, logical conclusion can be derived.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical and unbiased, describing a standard laboratory procedure and its underlying biological mechanisms.\n- **Flaw Check:**\n    - The problem does not violate scientific principles. The scenario is a textbook case of inducible clindamycin resistance in a Gram-positive coccus.\n    - The information is self-contained and sufficient for a conclusion. The $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ erythromycin zone (the diameter of the disk itself) indicates high-level resistance, which is a prerequisite for its role as an inducer. The $18\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ clindamycin zone, combined with the D-shape, presents the classic dilemma the D-test is designed to resolve.\n    - The setup is not contradictory or unrealistic. It represents a common clinical laboratory finding.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution can be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe interpretation of the results must proceed logically from the provided principles and observations.\n\n1.  **Interpretation of the Erythromycin Result:** The measured zone of inhibition for erythromycin is $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. A standard antibiotic disk has a diameter of $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. A zone diameter equal to the disk diameter signifies a complete lack of inhibition. Therefore, the *Streptococcus agalactiae* isolate is resistant to erythromycin, a macrolide antibiotic.\n\n2.  **Interpretation of the Clindamycin and D-test Result:** The problem states there is \"visible flattening of the clindamycin zone on the side facing the erythromycin disk.\" The problem text explicitly defines this \"D-shape\" as the characteristic result when a macrolide induces resistance to a lincosamide. This phenomenon occurs because the erythromycin diffusing from its disk induces the expression of the `erm` gene in the bacteria located in the area between the two disks. The resulting methyltransferase modifies the $23\\mathrm{S}$ rRNA of the $50\\mathrm{S}$ ribosomal subunit, making those bacteria resistant to clindamycin. On the far side of the clindamycin disk, where the erythromycin concentration is negligible, the `erm` gene is not induced, and the bacteria remain susceptible, allowing a zone of inhibition to form. The combination of growth (resistance) on one side and inhibition (susceptibility) on the other creates the \"D\" shape. This is, by definition, a positive D-test.\n\n3.  **Synthesis and Clinical Reporting:** The positive D-test demonstrates that the isolate possesses the genetic machinery (`erm` gene) for resistance to clindamycin, but this resistance is inducible. While the isolate appears susceptible to clindamycin *in vitro* when an inducer is absent (as suggested by the $18\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ zone size), the presence of the inducible gene implies a high risk of treatment failure *in vivo*. During therapy with clindamycin, spontaneous mutations can lead to constitutive expression of the `erm` gene, resulting in a fully resistant bacterial population and clinical failure. For this reason, an isolate with a positive D-test must be reported as clinically resistant to clindamycin, irrespective of the measured zone diameter. The `erm` mechanism confers co-resistance to macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B antibiotics, a phenotype known as MLS$_\\text{B}$ resistance. Since it is inducible, this is specifically inducible MLS$_\\text{B}$ (iMLS$_\\text{B}$) resistance.\n\nBased on this step-by-step derivation from the provided principles, the isolate is resistant to erythromycin and possesses inducible `erm`-mediated resistance to clindamycin. It should be reported as resistant to clindamycin.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The D-test is positive for inducible macrolide–lincosamide–streptogramin B (MLS$_\\text{B}$) resistance mediated by erm; clindamycin should be reported as resistant despite the $18\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ zone, and erythromycin is resistant.**\nThis statement is entirely consistent with our derivation.\n- The test is positive, as evidenced by the D-shape.\n- The mechanism is inducible MLS$_\\text{B}$ resistance mediated by `erm`, as described in the problem.\n- The reporting action—reporting clindamycin as resistant despite the seemingly susceptible zone size—is the correct clinical application of this finding.\n- The conclusion that erythromycin is resistant is correct based on the $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ zone.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The pattern reflects the “M” phenotype due to *msr(A)*-type efflux, conferring resistance to macrolides only; clindamycin should be reported as susceptible because the $18\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ zone indicates adequate inhibition and the zone shape is not relevant.**\nThis statement introduces a mechanism, *msr(A)* efflux, which is not mentioned in the problem's principles. An efflux pump active against macrolides but not lincosamides would lead to erythromycin resistance and clindamycin susceptibility. This would result in a negative D-test (a perfectly circular clindamycin zone). The statement that the zone shape is \"not relevant\" directly contradicts the premise of the D-test as described in the problem statement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The isolate has constitutive erm expression; both erythromycin and clindamycin are resistant, which would be evidenced by uniformly small zones without shape distortion, and the observed $18\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ clindamycin zone is consistent with full resistance.**\nConstitutive `erm` expression means the methyltransferase is always produced. This would result in resistance to both erythromycin and clindamycin. The phenotype would be a small, circular zone of inhibition for both antibiotics (e.g., both being $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$). The observation of a large ($18\\,\\mathrm{mm}$), distorted clindamycin zone refutes this hypothesis. The claim that an $18\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ zone is consistent with full resistance is false; such a zone demonstrates significant bacterial inhibition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The D-test result is invalid because the proximity of disks inevitably distorts the clindamycin zone; repeat testing is required, and no interpretation of inducible resistance can be made from a flattened zone.**\nThis statement reflects a complete misunderstanding of the D-test's purpose. The test is designed to create proximity between the disks *precisely* to check for distortion. The flattened zone is the specific, interpretable result of the test, not an artifact that invalidates it. The problem statement itself defines the flattened zone as the key indicator of inducible resistance.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4678167"}]}
