A key public health message is that the risk of transmission increases the longer an infected tick remains attached. This exercise provides a hands-on opportunity to model this relationship mathematically, moving from a first principle about the rate of transmission to a full predictive model. By deriving a logistic function and fitting it to hypothetical data, you will quantify this time-dependent risk and identify the critical inflection point in the transmission process [@problem_id:4614795].", "problem": "Lyme disease transmission from the blacklegged tick to a human host increases with the duration of tick attachment due to migration of Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes from the tick midgut to the salivary glands. Consider a cohort experiment in which laboratory-reared ticks infected with Borrelia burgdorferi are allowed to feed on a mammalian host, and the probability of successful transmission by time $t$ (attachment duration in hours) is estimated from replicate trials.\n\nUse the following foundational base: empirical transmission-versus-time curves that are monotone, bounded between $0$ and $1$, and symmetric sigmoids with a single inflection are well described by models in which the time derivative of the log-odds of the event is constant. Under that assumption, the log-odds increases linearly with time at a rate parameter that we denote by $\\alpha$, and the inflection time, denoted $t_{0}$, corresponds to the time at which the probability equals one-half.\n\nYou are given two empirically estimated transmission probabilities at specified attachment durations:\n- At $t = 36$ hours, the estimated transmission probability is $0.10$.\n- At $t = 60$ hours, the estimated transmission probability is $0.90$.\n\nStarting from the stated foundational base and no additional shortcuts, derive the analytic form of the sigmoidal transmission curve implied by a constant rate of change of the log-odds with respect to time, then fit its two free parameters to the two data points above.

The value of $P(t)$ is bounded between $0$ and $1$. The odds of transmission are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring, which is $\\frac{P(t)}{1-P(t)}$. The log-odds, which we denote as $L(t)$, is the natural logarithm of the odds:\n$$L(t) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{P(t)}{1-P(t)}\\right)$$\nThis function is also known as the logit function, $L(t) = \\text{logit}(P(t))$.\n\nThe foundational base of the model is the assumption that the time derivative of the log-odds is a constant. We denote this constant rate parameter by $\\alpha$:\n$$\\frac{dL(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left[\\ln\\left(\\frac{P(t)}{1-P(t)}\\right)\\right] = \\alpha$$\nTo find the functional form of $L(t)$, we integrate the above ordinary differential equation with respect to time $t$:\n$$\\int \\frac{dL(t)}{dt} dt = \\int \\alpha dt$$\n$$L(t) = \\alpha t + C$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration.

We use this condition to determine the integration constant $C$. At $t=t_0$, the odds are:\n$$\\frac{P(t_0)}{1-P(t_0)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{1-\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 1$$\nThe log-odds at the inflection time is therefore:\n$$L(t_0) = \\ln(1) = 0$$\nSubstituting this into our integrated equation for $L(t)$ at $t=t_0$:\n$$L(t_0) = \\alpha t_0 + C = 0$$\nThis gives the integration constant $C = -\\alpha t_0$.\n\nBy substituting $C$ back into the equation for the log-odds, we obtain the model in terms of its two parameters, $\\alpha$ and $t_0$:\n$$L(t) = \\alpha t - \\alpha t_0 = \\alpha(t - t_0)$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{P(t)}{1-P(t)}\\right) = \\alpha(t - t_0)$$\nTo derive the analytic form of the transmission curve $P(t)$, we solve this equation for $P(t)$.

At $t_1 = 36$ hours, the transmission probability is $P(36) = 0.10$.\n2.

A detailed solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the antibody index (AI) for *Borrelia burgdorferi* specific IgG. This index is designed to distinguish between specific antibodies that have crossed the blood–brain barrier (BBB) passively from the blood and those that have been actively synthesized within the central nervous system (intrathecal synthesis). It achieves this by normalizing the specific antibody ratio against the total antibody ratio, which serves as a marker for general BBB permeability and systemic IgG levels.\n\nThe formula for the antibody index, as described in the problem, is:\n$$ AI = \\frac{Q_{spec}}{Q_{total}} $$\nwhere $Q_{spec}$ is the quotient of the specific anti-Borrelia IgG concentrations in CSF and serum, and $Q_{total}$ is the quotient of the total IgG concentrations in CSF and serum.\n\nLet us define the given variables formally:\n- $C_{spec, CSF} = 1.5\\ \\mathrm{AU/mL}$ (Specific IgG concentration in CSF)\n- $C_{spec, S} = 150\\ \\mathrm{AU/mL}$ (Specific IgG concentration in serum)\n- $C_{total, CSF} = 30\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$ (Total IgG concentration in CSF)\n- $C_{total, S} = 10\\ \\mathrm{g/L}$ (Total IgG concentration in serum)\n\nThe quotients are:\n$$ Q_{spec} = \\frac{C_{spec, CSF}}{C_{spec, S}} $$\n$$ Q_{total} = \\frac{C_{total, CSF}}{C_{total, S}} $$\n\nSubstituting these into the AI formula gives:\n$$ AI = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{C_{spec, CSF}}{C_{spec, S}} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{C_{total, CSF}}{C_{total, S}} \\right)} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the quotient for the specific anti-Borrelia IgG, $Q_{spec}$. The units are arbitrary units per milliliter ($\\mathrm{AU/mL}$) for both measurements, so they are consistent and will cancel.\n$$ Q_{spec} = \\frac{1.5\\ \\mathrm{AU/mL}}{150\\ \\mathrm{AU/mL}} = \\frac{1.5}{150} = 0.01 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the quotient for the total IgG, $Q_{total}$. The units are inconsistent: milligrams per liter ($\\mathrm{mg/L}$) for CSF and grams per liter ($\\mathrm{g/L}$) for serum. We must convert them to a common unit before calculating the ratio. We will convert grams to milligrams, using the conversion factor $1\\ \\mathrm{g} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{mg}$.\n\n$$ C_{total, S} = 10\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\times \\frac{1000\\ \\mathrm{mg}}{1\\ \\mathrm{g}} = 10000\\ \\mathrm{mg/L} $$\n\nNow we can calculate $Q_{total}$, which will also be a dimensionless quantity.\n$$ Q_{total} = \\frac{30\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}}{10000\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}} = \\frac{30}{10000} = 0.003 $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the antibody index by taking the ratio of the two quotients.\n$$ AI = \\frac{Q_{spec}}{Q_{total}} = \\frac{0.01}{0.003} = \\frac{1/100}{3/1000} = \\frac{1}{100} \\times \\frac{1000}{3} = \\frac{10}{3} $$\n$$ AI = 3.333... $$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ AI \\approx 3.33 $$\n\n**Interpretation of the Result:**\nThe antibody index corrects for the passive transfer of serum IgG into the CSF. If the specific antibodies in the CSF are present only due to transfer from the blood, the ratio of specific antibody concentrations ($Q_{spec}$) should be approximately equal to the ratio of total IgG concentrations ($Q_{total}$), resulting in an $AI$ value of approximately $1.0$.\n\nAn $AI$ value significantly greater than $1.0$ indicates that the proportion of specific antibody is higher in the CSF than in the serum, which is evidence of local, intrathecal synthesis of that specific antibody. In the clinical context of neuroborreliosis, a positive finding for intrathecal synthesis is a key diagnostic criterion. The diagnostic cutoff for a positive result is typically set at an $AI$ value of $1.5$ or greater, though this can vary slightly between laboratories (e.g., $1.3$ to $1.5$).\n\nThe calculated antibody index of $3.33$ is substantially greater than the common diagnostic threshold of $1.5$. This result provides strong evidence for the intrathecal production of anti-Borrelia IgG antibodies and, in conjunction with the patient's clinical signs of meningoradiculitis, strongly supports the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.33}$$", "id": "4614731"}]}
