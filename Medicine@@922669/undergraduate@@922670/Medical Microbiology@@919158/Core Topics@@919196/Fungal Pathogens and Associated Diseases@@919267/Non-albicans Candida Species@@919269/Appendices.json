Assume that at a fixed substrate concentration the enzyme follows Michaelis–Menten kinetics and that micafungin acts as a purely competitive inhibitor against UDP-glucose. In competitive inhibition, the maximal velocity $V_{\\max}$ is unchanged and the apparent Michaelis constant $K_m$ is multiplied by the factor $\\left(1 + [I]/K_i\\right)$, where $[I]$ is the inhibitor concentration and $K_i$ is the inhibitor dissociation constant.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and all necessary information is provided. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Fractional Inhibition Expression\nThe initial rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction following Michaelis-Menten kinetics is given by:\n$$ v = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_m + [S]} $$\nwhere $v$ is the initial reaction velocity, $V_{\\max}$ is the maximal velocity, $[S]$ is the substrate concentration, and $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant.\n\nIn the absence of the inhibitor micafungin, the initial rate, $v(0)$, is:\n$$ v(0) = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_m + [S]} $$\n\nFor competitive inhibition, the inhibitor binds only to the free enzyme, increasing the apparent Michaelis constant to $K_{m,app}$ without affecting $V_{\\max}$. The problem states that:\n$$ K_{m,app} = K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) $$\nwhere $[I]$ is the inhibitor concentration and $K_i$ is the inhibition constant.\n\nThe initial rate in the presence of the inhibitor, $v([I])$, is therefore:\n$$ v([I]) = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_{m,app} + [S]} = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]} $$\n\nThe fractional inhibition, $F$, is defined as $F = 1 - \\frac{v([I])}{v(0)}$. Substituting the expressions for $v([I])$ and $v(0)$:\n$$ F = 1 - \\frac{\\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]}}{\\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_m + [S]}} $$\nThe term $V_{\\max} [S]$ cancels out, yielding:\n$$ F = 1 - \\frac{K_m + [S]}{K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]} = 1 - \\frac{K_m + [S]}{K_m + [S] + K_m \\frac{[I]}{K_i}} $$\nTo combine the terms, we find a common denominator:\n$$ F = \\frac{\\left(K_m + [S] + K_m \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) - (K_m + [S])}{K_m + [S] + K_m \\frac{[I]}{K_i}} $$\nSimplifying the numerator gives the final derived expression for fractional inhibition:\n$$ F = \\frac{K_m \\frac{[I]}{K_i}}{K_m + [S] + K_m \\frac{[I]}{K_i}} $$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nThe next step is to compute the numerical values for the fractional inhibition for the wild-type ($F_{\\mathrm{WT}}$) and mutant ($F_{\\mathrm{Mut}}$) enzymes.\n\nFirst, we ensure all concentrations are in consistent units or use dimensionless ratios. The ratio $\\frac{[I]}{K_i}$ is dimensionless, which simplifies calculations.\nGiven values:\n- $[S] = 1.20\\ \\mathrm{mM}$\n- $K_m = 0.40\\ \\mathrm{mM}$\n- $[I] = 0.250\\ \\mathrm{\\mu M} = 250\\ \\mathrm{nM}$\n\nFor the wild-type enzyme:\n- $K_i = 10.0\\ \\mathrm{nM}$\nThe ratio $\\frac{[I]}{K_i}$ is:\n$$ \\frac{[I]}{K_i} = \\frac{250\\ \\mathrm{nM}}{10.0\\ \\mathrm{nM}} = 25 $$\nNow, we calculate $F_{\\mathrm{WT}}$ using the derived formula:\n$$ F_{\\mathrm{WT}} = \\frac{K_m \\frac{[I]}{K_i}}{K_m + [S] + K_m \\frac{[I]}{K_i}} = \\frac{(0.40\\ \\mathrm{mM}) \\times (25)}{(0.40\\ \\mathrm{mM}) + (1.20\\ \\mathrm{mM}) + (0.40\\ \\mathrm{mM}) \\times (25)} $$\n$$ F_{\\mathrm{WT}} = \\frac{10\\ \\mathrm{mM}}{1.60\\ \\mathrm{mM} + 10\\ \\mathrm{mM}} = \\frac{10}{11.60} \\approx 0.862068... $$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures, $F_{\\mathrm{WT}} = 0.862$.\n\nFor the mutant enzyme:\n- $K_i^{\\prime} = 400\\ \\mathrm{nM}$\nThe ratio $\\frac{[I]}{K_i^{\\prime}}$ is:\n$$ \\frac{[I]}{K_i^{\\prime}} = \\frac{250\\ \\mathrm{nM}}{400\\ \\mathrm{nM}} = \\frac{25}{40} = 0.625 $$\nNow, we calculate $F_{\\mathrm{Mut}}$:\n$$ F_{\\mathrm{Mut}} = \\frac{K_m \\frac{[I]}{K_i^{\\prime}}}{K_m + [S] + K_m \\frac{[I]}{K_i^{\\prime}}} = \\frac{(0.40\\ \\mathrm{mM}) \\times (0.625)}{(0.40\\ \\mathrm{mM}) + (1.20\\ \\mathrm{mM}) + (0.40\\ \\mathrm{mM}) \\times (0.625)} $$\n$$ F_{\\mathrm{Mut}} = \\frac{0.25\\ \\mathrm{mM}}{1.60\\ \\mathrm{mM} + 0.25\\ \\mathrm{mM}} = \\frac{0.25}{1.85} \\approx 0.135135... $$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures, $F_{\\mathrm{Mut}} = 0.135$.\n\nThe results indicate that at the given concentrations, micafungin inhibits the wild-type enzyme by approximately $86.2\\%$, but the mutation reduces its effectiveness, causing only about $13.5\\%$ inhibition.

Since $f\\mathrm{AUC}$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the expectation operator:\n$$E\\left[\\frac{f\\mathrm{AUC}}{\\mathrm{MIC}}\\right] = f\\mathrm{AUC} \\times E\\left[\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{MIC}}\\right]$$\nThis is distinct from the ratio of the expected values, $\\frac{f\\mathrm{AUC}}{E[\\mathrm{MIC}]}$, which would be an incorrect calculation.\n\nWe must now compute the expected value of the reciprocal of the MIC, $E[1/\\mathrm{MIC}]$. For a discrete random variable $X$ with possible values $x_i$ and corresponding probabilities $P(X=x_i)$, the expected value of a function $g(X)$ is given by $E[g(X)] = \\sum_i g(x_i) P(X=x_i)$.\nIn this problem, the random variable is the MIC, and the function is $g(\\mathrm{MIC}) = 1/\\mathrm{MIC}$. The MIC distribution is provided as:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item MIC = $1\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$ with probability $P(\\mathrm{MIC}=1) = 0.20$\n    \\item MIC = $2\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$ with probability $P(\\mathrm{MIC}=2) = 0.50$\n    \\item MIC = $4\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$ with probability $P(\\mathrm{MIC}=4) = 0.25$\n    \\item MIC = $8\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$ with probability $P(\\mathrm{MIC}=8) = 0.05$\n\\end{itemize}\nThe sum of probabilities is $0.20 + 0.50 + 0.25 + 0.05 = 1.00$, confirming a valid probability distribution.\n\nNow, we calculate $E[1/\\mathrm{MIC}]$:\n$$E\\left[\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{MIC}}\\right] = \\left(\\frac{1}{1\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}}\\right)(0.20) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}}\\right)(0.50) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}}\\right)(0.25) + \\left(\\frac{1}{8\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}}\\right)(0.05)$$\n$$E\\left[\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{MIC}}\\right] = (1.0)(0.20) + (0.5)(0.50) + (0.25)(0.25) + (0.125)(0.05) \\,\\, \\mathrm{L/mg}$$\n$$E\\left[\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{MIC}}\\right] = 0.20 + 0.25 + 0.0625 + 0.00625 \\,\\, \\mathrm{L/mg}$$\n$$E\\left[\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{MIC}}\\right] = 0.51875 \\,\\, \\mathrm{L/mg}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the expected value of the $f\\mathrm{AUC}/\\mathrm{MIC}$ ratio:\n$$E\\left[\\frac{f\\mathrm{AUC}}{\\mathrm{MIC}}\\right] = f\\mathrm{AUC} \\times E\\left[\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{MIC}}\\right]$$\n$$E\\left[\\frac{f\\mathrm{AUC}}{\\mathrm{MIC}}\\right] = (16.8\\,\\mathrm{mg\\cdot h/L}) \\times (0.51875 \\,\\, \\mathrm{L/mg})$$\n$$E\\left[\\frac{f\\mathrm{AUC}}{\\mathrm{MIC}}\\right] = 8.715 \\,\\, \\mathrm{h}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$8.715 \\,\\, \\mathrm{h} \\approx 8.72 \\,\\, \\mathrm{h}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8.72}$$", "id": "4657613"}]}
