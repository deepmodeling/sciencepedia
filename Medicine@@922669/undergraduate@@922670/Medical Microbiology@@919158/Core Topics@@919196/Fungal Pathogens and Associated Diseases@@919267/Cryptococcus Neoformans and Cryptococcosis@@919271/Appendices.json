In rich medium such as Sabouraud dextrose broth, optical density (OD) at $600$ nm is proportional to viable biomass during the exponential (log) phase. Exponential biomass accumulation in well-mixed batch culture is modeled by the first-order kinetic law $dX/dt=\\mu X$, where $X$ is biomass and $\\mu$ is the specific growth rate. Because $OD(t)\\propto X(t)$, the same exponential law applies to $OD(t)$ during log phase.\n\nA clinical isolate of Cryptococcus neoformans is inoculated into Sabouraud dextrose broth and incubated at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ with aeration. OD at $600$ nm is recorded as $OD_{0}=0.05$ at $t=0$ hours and $OD_{t}=0.40$ at $t=6$ hours, and the culture remains in exponential phase over this interval.\n\nUsing the exponential growth law and the proportionality of OD to biomass, derive an expression for the specific growth rate $\\mu$ in terms of $OD_{t}$, $OD_{0}$, and $t$, and compute its value for the given data.
