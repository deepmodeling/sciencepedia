Neutralizing antibodies, generated by vaccination with toxoid, bind the toxin during pre-incubation and prevent its interaction with neuronal targets, thereby abolishing its biological activity. Non-immune serum lacks specific anti-toxin antibodies and therefore does not neutralize the toxin. Sterile medium contains no toxin.\n\nEvaluate each condition:\n- Condition 1 (Toxin Solution + Immune Serum): Specific anti-tetanus toxin antibodies in immune serum bind and neutralize the toxin during pre-incubation, so the mixture lacks biologically active toxin. Expect no widespread apoptosis.\n- Condition 2 (Toxin Solution + Non-Immune Serum): No specific antibodies present; toxin remains active. Expect widespread apoptosis.\n- Condition 3 (Sterile Medium + Immune Serum): No toxin present; antibodies alone do not induce apoptosis.
