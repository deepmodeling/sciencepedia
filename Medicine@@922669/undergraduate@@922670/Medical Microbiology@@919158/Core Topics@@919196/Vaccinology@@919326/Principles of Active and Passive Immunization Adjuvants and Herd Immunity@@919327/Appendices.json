Let $p$ denote the fraction of the population vaccinated. Assume homogeneous mixing, no prior immunity, and that a vaccinated individual is either fully protected against transmission with probability $E$ or not protected and behaves like an unvaccinated individual; there are no behavioral changes due to vaccination and no indirect effects other than reduction in susceptibility.

The given values for $R_0$ and $E$ are realistic for various infectious diseases and vaccines.\n\nThe verdict is that the problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe first step is to derive the analytic expression for the herd immunity coverage threshold, $p_c$. The threshold is defined by the condition that the effective reproduction number, $R_e$, is reduced to less than $1$. The critical threshold $p_c$ is the value of $p$ for which $R_e = 1$.
