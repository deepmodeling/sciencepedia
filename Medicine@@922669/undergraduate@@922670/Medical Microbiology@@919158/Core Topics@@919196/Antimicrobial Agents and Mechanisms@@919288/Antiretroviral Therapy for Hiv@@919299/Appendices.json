The provided data are sufficient and consistent for deriving a unique solution.\n\n### Part (a): Derivation of the Expression for E(C)\n\nThe problem describes a single-site, monotonic, saturable pharmacodynamic relationship with a Hill coefficient of $1$. This corresponds to the standard Emax model, which can be derived from the general Hill equation for an inhibitory effect $E$ as a function of drug concentration $C$.\n\nThe general form of the Hill equation for an effect that is zero at zero concentration ($E(0)=0$) is:\n$$E(C) = \\frac{E_{\\text{max}} C^n}{K^n + C^n}$$\nHere, $E_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximum achievable effect, $n$ is the Hill coefficient describing the cooperativity of binding, and $K$ is the drug concentration that produces $50\\%$ of the maximal effect.\n\nThe problem specifies that the Hill coefficient is $1$. Substituting $n=1$ into the general Hill equation yields:\n$$E(C) = \\frac{E_{\\text{max}} C}{K + C}$$\nThis functional form is characteristic of single-site, non-cooperative binding and is mathematically analogous to the Michaelis-Menten equation in enzyme kinetics.\n\nThe problem defines the half-maximal inhibitory concentration, $IC_{50}$, as the concentration at which the fractional inhibition is half of the maximum: $E(IC_{50}) = \\frac{1}{2} E_{\\text{max}}$. We can use this definition to relate the constant $K$ to the parameter $IC_{50}$.\nSubstituting $C=IC_{50}$ into our derived equation for $E(C)$:\n$$E(IC_{50}) = \\frac{E_{\\text{max}} IC_{50}}{K + IC_{50}}$$\nEquating this with the definition provided in the problem:\n$$\\frac{E_{\\text{max}}}{2} = \\frac{E_{\\text{max}} IC_{50}}{K + IC_{50}}$$\nAssuming $E_{\\text{max}} \\neq 0$ (which is necessary for a non-trivial effect), we can divide both sides by $E_{\\text{max}}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{IC_{50}}{K + IC_{50}}$$\nSolving for $K$:\n$$K + IC_{50} = 2 \\cdot IC_{50}$$\n$$K = IC_{50}$$\nThis confirms that for a system with a Hill coefficient of $1$, the constant $K$ in the equation is identical to the $IC_{50}$.\n\nBy substituting $K=IC_{50}$ back into the equation for $E(C)$, we obtain the final expression in terms of the specified parameters:\n$$E(C) = \\frac{E_{\\text{max}} C}{IC_{50} + C}$$\nThis expression satisfies all the stated conditions:\n1.  If $C = 0$, then $E(0) = \\frac{E_{\\text{max}} \\cdot 0}{IC_{50} + 0} = 0$.\n2.  As $C \\to \\infty$, $E(C) \\to \\frac{E_{\\text{max}} C}{C} = E_{\\text{max}}$.\n3.

This practice presents a common clinical challenge: adjusting drug dosage in response to declining kidney function. You will apply core pharmacokinetic principles to calculate a new dose for lamivudine, ensuring the patient continues to receive a safe and effective therapeutic level of the drug despite changes in renal clearance [@problem_id:4606686].", "problem": "A clinically stable adult with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is receiving oral lamivudine once daily at a maintenance dose of $300$ mg when their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is $90$ mL/min.

Express your final dose in milligrams and round your answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed, resting on fundamental principles of pharmacokinetics. A solution can be derived through a systematic application of these principles.\n\nThe primary objective is to maintain the same average steady-state plasma concentration ($C_{\\text{ss,avg}}$) of lamivudine despite a change in renal function. For a drug administered orally, the average steady-state concentration is defined by the equation:\n$$C_{\\text{ss,avg}} = \\frac{F \\times D}{\\text{CL} \\times \\tau}$$\nwhere $F$ is the bioavailability, $D$ is the dose, $\\text{CL}$ is the total clearance of the drug, and $\\tau$ is the dosing interval.\n\nLet the initial state (baseline) be denoted by subscript $1$ and the final state (with reduced renal function) be denoted by subscript $2$. The problem requires that $C_{\\text{ss,avg},1} = C_{\\text{ss,avg},2}$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$\\frac{F_1 \\times D_1}{\\text{CL}_1 \\times \\tau_1} = \\frac{F_2 \\times D_2}{\\text{CL}_2 \\times \\tau_2}$$\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the bioavailability ($F$) and the dosing interval ($\\tau$) are unchanged. Thus, $F_1 = F_2$ and $\\tau_1 = \\tau_2$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{D_1}{\\text{CL}_1} = \\frac{D_2}{\\text{CL}_2}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the new dose, $D_2$. Rearranging the equation gives:\n$$D_2 = D_1 \\times \\frac{\\text{CL}_2}{\\text{CL}_1}$$\nThis shows that the new dose is the original dose adjusted by the ratio of the new total clearance to the original total clearance. Our task now is to determine this ratio.\n\nTotal clearance ($\\text{CL}$) is the sum of renal clearance ($\\text{CL}_{\\text{renal}}$) and non-renal clearance ($\\text{CL}_{\\text{non-renal}}$):\n$$\\text{CL} = \\text{CL}_{\\text{renal}} + \\text{CL}_{\\text{non-renal}}$$\n\nAt baseline (state $1$), the estimated glomerular filtration rate is $\\text{eGFR}_1 = 90$ mL/min. The fraction of total clearance that is renal is given as $f_{\\text{renal},1} = 0.7$.\nTherefore, the components of the baseline total clearance, $\\text{CL}_1$, can be expressed as:\n$$\\text{CL}_{\\text{renal},1} = f_{\\text{renal},1} \\times \\text{CL}_1 = 0.7 \\times \\text{CL}_1$$\n$$\\text{CL}_{\\text{non-renal},1} = (1 - f_{\\text{renal},1}) \\times \\text{CL}_1 = (1 - 0.7) \\times \\text{CL}_1 = 0.3 \\times \\text{CL}_1$$\n\nNext, we consider the final state (state $2$), where the eGFR has declined to $\\text{eGFR}_2 = 30$ mL/min.\nThe problem states that non-renal clearance remains constant, so:\n$$\\text{CL}_{\\text{non-renal},2} = \\text{CL}_{\\text{non-renal},1} = 0.3 \\times \\text{CL}_1$$\n\nIt is also stated that renal clearance is directly proportional to eGFR. This implies that the ratio of renal clearances is equal to the ratio of the eGFR values:\n$$\\frac{\\text{CL}_{\\text{renal},2}}{\\text{CL}_{\\text{renal},1}} = \\frac{\\text{eGFR}_2}{\\text{eGFR}_1}$$\nWe can now calculate the new renal clearance, $\\text{CL}_{\\text{renal},2}$:\n$$\\text{CL}_{\\text{renal},2} = \\text{CL}_{\\text{renal},1} \\times \\frac{\\text{eGFR}_2}{\\text{eGFR}_1} = (0.7 \\times \\text{CL}_1) \\times \\frac{30 \\text{ mL/min}}{90 \\text{ mL/min}} = (0.7 \\times \\text{CL}_1) \\times \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nNow we can compute the new total clearance, $\\text{CL}_2$, by summing its renal and non-renal components:\n$$\\text{CL}_2 = \\text{CL}_{\\text{renal},2} + \\text{CL}_{\\text{non-renal},2} = \\left(0.7 \\times \\text{CL}_1 \\times \\frac{1}{3}\\right) + (0.3 \\times \\text{CL}_1)$$\nFactoring out $\\text{CL}_1$:\n$$\\text{CL}_2 = \\text{CL}_1 \\left( \\frac{0.7}{3} + 0.3 \\right)$$\n\nTo find the ratio $\\frac{\\text{CL}_2}{\\text{CL}_1}$, we evaluate the expression in the parentheses:\n$$\\frac{\\text{CL}_2}{\\text{CL}_1} = \\frac{0.7}{3} + 0.3 = \\frac{7}{30} + \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{7}{30} + \\frac{9}{30} = \\frac{16}{30} = \\frac{8}{15}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this ratio back into the equation for the new dose, $D_2$. The initial dose is $D_1 = 300$ mg.\n$$D_2 = D_1 \\times \\frac{\\text{CL}_2}{\\text{CL}_1} = 300 \\text{ mg} \\times \\frac{8}{15}$$\n$$D_2 = \\frac{300 \\times 8}{15} \\text{ mg} = 20 \\times 8 \\text{ mg} = 160 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nThe result of the calculation is exactly $160$ mg.

Frame your reasoning from first principles of enzyme–ligand interaction and structural biophysics, rather than memorized resistance tables.\n\nUse the following foundational bases:\n- Reverse Transcriptase (RT) is an enzyme whose function depends on the three-dimensional arrangement of amino acid side chains that create a hydrophobic NNRTI-binding pocket adjacent to, but distinct from, the polymerase active site. Mutations alter side-chain identity, affecting pocket geometry and interaction types.\n- Ligand binding affinity can be related to the standard binding free energy by the relation $ \\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} = RT \\ln K_d $, where $R$ is the gas constant and $T$ is absolute temperature. More negative $ \\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} $ corresponds to stronger binding (lower $K_d$), and any mutation that removes stabilizing interactions or introduces steric clashes will make $ \\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} $ less favorable.\n- Side-chain substitutions change interaction contributions to $ \\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} $ through loss or gain of $\\pi$–$\\pi$ stacking, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic packing, and steric complementarity. For example, Y181C removes an aromatic ring and replaces it with a smaller, sulfur-containing side chain, decreasing potential $\\pi$–$\\pi$ contacts in the pocket; G190A replaces glycine with alanine, adding a methyl group that reduces local conformational freedom and increases steric bulk near the pocket entrance.\n\nAssume the following qualitative structural features of the NNRTIs in question, without relying on specific resistance data:\n- Efavirenz has a relatively rigid, compact tricyclic core with limited conformational adaptability, and its binding is stabilized by hydrophobic packing and favorable alignment with aromatic residues in the pocket.\n- Rilpivirine is a diarylpyrimidine with substantial conformational flexibility and an extended shape; its binding relies on fitting into a “butterfly-like” conformation stabilized by multiple hydrophobic and $\\pi$-interactions across the pocket, including near positions $181$ and $190$.\n- Doravirine has a compact, conformationally adaptable scaffold with polar functionalities positioned to form interactions with backbone atoms and conserved residues and is designed to minimize reliance on specific aromatic side-chain contacts and to avoid steric clashes in mutated pockets.\n\nBased on these principles, which NNRTI is most likely to retain meaningful activity against HIV RT with Y181C and G190A, and why?\n\nChoose the single best option:\n- A.

It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\nThe objective is to determine which of the three Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs)—efavirenz, rilpivirine, or doravirine—is most likely to retain activity against a Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) variant containing the Y181C and G190A mutations in its reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme. The analysis will be based on the provided first principles of enzyme-ligand interactions.\n\nThe binding affinity of a ligand (the NNRTI) to an enzyme (RT) is quantitatively described by the standard binding free energy, $ \\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} $. This is related to the dissociation constant, $K_d$, by the equation $ \\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} = RT \\ln K_d $, where $R$ is the gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. A more potent inhibitor has a stronger binding affinity, which corresponds to a smaller $K_d$ and consequently a more negative $ \\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} $. Mutations in the binding pocket can alter $ \\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} $ by either removing favorable interactions (e.g., hydrophobic, $\\pi$-stacking, hydrogen bonds) or introducing unfavorable interactions (e.g., steric clashes, electrostatic repulsion). Such changes make $ \\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} $ less negative (i.e., increase $ \\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} $), leading to a higher $K_d$ and reduced drug efficacy.\n\nWe must analyze the structural and energetic consequences of the two specified mutations on the binding of each drug.\n\n**Analysis of the Mutations:**\n\n1.  **Y181C:** This mutation substitutes tyrosine (Y) with cysteine (C) at position $181$. The tyrosine side chain possesses a large, planar, aromatic phenol group. The cysteine side chain is much smaller, consisting of a sulfhydryl group (or thiol, -SH). The primary biophysical consequence of this mutation on the NNRTI binding pocket is the loss of the aromatic ring. This eliminates the possibility for stabilizing $\\pi$–$\\pi$ or cation-$\\pi$ interactions with a drug and removes a significant volume of hydrophobic packing. Drugs that rely heavily on interaction with the Y$181$ aromatic ring will suffer a substantial loss in binding affinity, resulting in a less negative $ \\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} $.\n\n2.  **G190A:** This mutation substitutes glycine (G) with alanine (A) at position $190$. Glycine is unique among amino acids in that its side chain is a single hydrogen atom, which confers maximal conformational flexibility to the polypeptide backbone. Alanine has a small, non-polar methyl group (-CH$_3$) as its side chain. The key consequence of this mutation is the introduction of steric bulk where there was previously none. This new methyl group can sterically clash with a bound ligand, introducing a significant energetic penalty and making $ \\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} $ less negative. The replacement of glycine also reduces the local flexibility of the protein backbone, which can hinder the enzyme's ability to adopt an optimal conformation for ligand binding (a process known as induced fit).\n\n**Evaluation of Each NNRTI:**\n\nNow, we evaluate how these mutational effects impact the binding of each of the three NNRTIs, based on their given structural characteristics.\n\n*   **Efavirenz:** This drug is described as having a rigid, compact core with limited conformational adaptability. Its binding is stabilized by hydrophobic packing and alignment with aromatic residues. The Y181C mutation directly removes an aromatic residue from the binding pocket. Given efavirenz's reliance on such interactions, this loss will significantly destabilize its binding, leading to a large, unfavorable change in $ \\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} $. Furthermore, its rigid structure (\"limited conformational adaptability\") makes it highly sensitive to changes in the pocket's shape. The steric bulk introduced by the G190A mutation is likely to cause a clash with the inflexible efavirenz molecule, further increasing the energetic penalty for binding. Therefore, efavirenz is expected to lose substantial activity against this mutant RT.\n\n*   **Rilpivirine:** This drug is described as a diarylpyrimidine with substantial conformational flexibility and an extended shape. Critically, its binding is stated to rely on interactions near positions $181$ and $190$. The loss of the Y181C aromatic ring will disrupt the $\\pi$-interactions that stabilize rilpivirine's binding in that region. The introduction of the alanine methyl group at position $190$ will likely introduce a steric clash with this extended molecule, disrupting its required \"butterfly-like\" conformation. While its flexibility might allow some degree of adaptation, the problem statement explicitly ties its binding mode to these two specific locations. The combination of losing a key interaction site (at $181$) and introducing a steric clash (at $190$) will severely compromise its binding affinity, making $ \\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} $ much less favorable.\n\n*   **Doravirine:** This drug is described as having a compact, conformationally adaptable scaffold. Most importantly, it is **designed to minimize reliance on specific aromatic side-chain contacts and to avoid steric clashes in mutated pockets**. This design philosophy directly counters the effects of the two mutations in question.\n    *   In the context of Y181C, doravirine's minimized reliance on aromatic contacts means the loss of the tyrosine side chain at position $181$ will have a much smaller detrimental impact on its binding energy compared to efavirenz and rilpivirine.\n    *   In the context of G190A, doravirine's conformational adaptability and its design to \"avoid steric clashes\" suggest it can contort its shape to accommodate the new methyl group at position $190$ without a significant energetic penalty.\n    *   Furthermore, its ability to form interactions with conserved backbone atoms provides a robust anchoring mechanism that is less susceptible to side-chain mutations.\n    *   Consequently, the overall change in $ \\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} $ for doravirine binding to the mutant RT is expected to be significantly smaller than for the other two drugs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the provided first principles, doravirine's structural and chemical properties are best suited to tolerate the combined Y181C and G190A mutations. Efavirenz is disadvantaged by its rigidity and reliance on aromatic interactions. Rilpivirine is disadvantaged by its reliance on interactions at the precise sites of mutation. Doravirine, by its intrinsic design, is posited to be resilient to these specific structural perturbations. Therefore, doravirine is the NNRTI most likely to retain meaningful activity.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis:**\n\n- **A. Efavirenz:** Incorrect. Efavirenz's rigid structure and reliance on aromatic residues make it highly susceptible to the combination of the Y181C (loss of aromatic partner) and G190A (new steric bulk) mutations. Its activity is expected to be significantly compromised.\n\n- **B. Rilpivirine:** Incorrect. Rilpivirine's binding is explicitly stated to depend on interactions in the vicinity of both mutated residues, $181$ and $190$. The mutations would therefore directly disrupt its binding mode, leading to a significant loss of affinity.\n\n- **C. Doravirine:** Correct. As per the analysis, doravirine is specifically designed with features—conformational adaptability, minimized reliance on specific side-chain contacts, and avoidance of steric clashes—that make it uniquely resilient to the types of structural changes introduced by the Y181C and G190A mutations.\n\n- **D. All listed NNRTIs retain comparable activity:** Incorrect. The structural principles provided lead to a clear differentiation in the expected impact of the mutations on each drug. Their retained activities would not be comparable; doravirine is expected to retain significantly more activity than efavirenz and rilpivirine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4606694"}]}
