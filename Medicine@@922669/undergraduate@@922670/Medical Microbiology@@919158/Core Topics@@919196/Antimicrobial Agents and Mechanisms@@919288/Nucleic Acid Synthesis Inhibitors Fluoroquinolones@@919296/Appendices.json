The problem states a permeability hierarchy where electrically neutral species are most permeable, followed by zwitterionic species, with charged cationic and anionic species being poorly permeable. In the context of the calculated macroscopic species (cationic, zwitterionic, anionic), the zwitterion is the most permeable as it has a net charge of zero.

The clinical goal is to maintain the ratio $AUC_{24}/MIC$, where $MIC$ is the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration. Since $MIC$ is a property of the microorganism and is considered constant for a given infection, maintaining the $AUC_{24}/MIC$ target is equivalent to maintaining a constant $AUC_{24}$.\n\nLet the reference state (normal renal function) be denoted by the subscript 'ref' and the new state (impaired renal function) by the subscript 'new'.

This is defined as:\n$$f_r = \\frac{CL_{R, \\mathrm{ref}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{ref}}}$$\nFrom this, we can express the reference renal and nonrenal clearances in terms of the total reference clearance:\n$$CL_{R, \\mathrm{ref}} = f_r \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{ref}}$$\n$$CL_{NR, \\mathrm{ref}} = CL_{\\mathrm{ref}} - CL_{R, \\mathrm{ref}} = CL_{\\mathrm{ref}} - f_r \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{ref}} = (1 - f_r) \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{ref}}$$\n\nFor the patient with impaired renal function, the new total clearance is $CL_{\\mathrm{new}} = CL_{R, \\mathrm{new}} + CL_{NR, \\mathrm{new}}$. The problem makes two key assumptions:\n1. Nonrenal clearance is unchanged: $CL_{NR, \\mathrm{new}} = CL_{NR, \\mathrm{ref}} = (1 - f_r) \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.\n2. Renal clearance scales proportionally with creatinine clearance ($CrCl$): $\\frac{CL_{R, \\mathrm{new}}}{CL_{R, \\mathrm{ref}}} = \\frac{CrCl_{\\mathrm{new}}}{CrCl_{\\mathrm{ref}}}$.\nThis allows us to express the new renal clearance as:\n$$CL_{R, \\mathrm{new}} = CL_{R, \\mathrm{ref}} \\cdot \\frac{CrCl_{\\mathrm{new}}}{CrCl_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = (f_r \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{ref}}) \\cdot \\frac{CrCl_{\\mathrm{new}}}{CrCl_{\\mathrm{ref}}}$$\n\nNow, we can assemble the expression for the new total clearance, $CL_{\\mathrm{new}}$:\n$$CL_{\\mathrm{new}} = CL_{R, \\mathrm{new}} + CL_{NR, \\mathrm{new}} = \\left(f_r \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\cdot \\frac{CrCl_{\\mathrm{new}}}{CrCl_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right) + \\left((1 - f_r) \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)$$\nFactoring out $CL_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ gives the relationship between the new and reference clearances:\n$$CL_{\\mathrm{new}} = CL_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\left[ f_r \\cdot \\frac{CrCl_{\\mathrm{new}}}{CrCl_{\\mathrm{ref}}} + (1 - f_r) \\right]$$\nThe ratio of clearances is therefore:\n$$\\frac{CL_{\\mathrm{new}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = f_r \\cdot \\frac{CrCl_{\\mathrm{new}}}{CrCl_{\\mathrm{ref}}} + (1 - f_r)$$\nThe required ratio for our dosing interval adjustment is the inverse:\n$$\\frac{CL_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{new}}} = \\frac{1}{f_r \\cdot \\frac{CrCl_{\\mathrm{new}}}{CrCl_{\\mathrm{ref}}} + (1 - f_r)}$$\n\nSubstituting this expression back into the dosing-interval adjustment rule $\\tau_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\cdot \\frac{CL_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{new}}}$ gives the specific rule for this problem:\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\left( \\frac{1}{f_r \\cdot \\frac{CrCl_{\\mathrm{new}}}{CrCl_{\\mathrm{ref}}} + (1 - f_r)} \\right)$$\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values:\n- Reference dosing interval: $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 24 \\ \\mathrm{h}$\n- Renal fraction of clearance: $f_r = 0.75$\n- Reference creatinine clearance: $CrCl_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 100 \\ \\mathrm{mL/min}$\n- New creatinine clearance: $CrCl_{\\mathrm{new}} = 30 \\ \\mathrm{mL/min}$\n\nFirst, calculate the ratio of creatinine clearances:\n$$\\frac{CrCl_{\\mathrm{new}}}{CrCl_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = \\frac{30 \\ \\mathrm{mL/min}}{100 \\ \\mathrm{mL/min}} = 0.3$$\nNext, calculate the denominator of the adjustment factor:\n$$f_r \\cdot \\frac{CrCl_{\\mathrm{new}}}{CrCl_{\\mathrm{ref}}} + (1 - f_r) = (0.75)(0.3) + (1 - 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.25 = 0.475$$\nThis value, $0.475$, represents the ratio of the new total clearance to the reference total clearance, i.e., $CL_{\\mathrm{new}}/CL_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.\nThe adjustment factor itself is the reciprocal of this value:\n$$\\frac{CL_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{new}}} = \\frac{1}{0.475}$$\nFinally, we compute the new dosing interval, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{new}}$:\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{new}} = 24 \\ \\mathrm{h} \\cdot \\frac{1}{0.475} \\approx 50.5263157... \\ \\mathrm{h}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final numeric answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{new}} \\approx 50.53 \\ \\mathrm{h}$$\nThe derived dosing-interval adjustment rule is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\left[ f_r \\frac{CrCl_{\\mathrm{new}}}{CrCl_{\\mathrm{ref}}} + (1 - f_r) \\right]^{-1}$, and the computed new interval is $50.53$ hours.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{50.53}$$", "id": "4658568"}]}
