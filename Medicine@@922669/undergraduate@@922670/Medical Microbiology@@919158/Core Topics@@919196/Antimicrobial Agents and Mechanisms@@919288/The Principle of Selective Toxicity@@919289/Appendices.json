The provided data for host-cell viability includes the point:\n$$\nV_{h}(c=20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) \\approx 0.5\n$$\nFrom this datum and the definition, we directly identify the median toxic concentration:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CC}_{50} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\n$$\n\nNext, we must determine the value of $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ for the bacteria. By definition, $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ is the concentration $c$ at which the bacterial survival fraction, $S_{b}(c)$, is equal to $0.5$. The provided data for bacterial survival includes the point:\n$$\nS_{b}(c=5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) \\approx 0.5\n$$\nFrom this datum and the definition, we directly identify the median effective concentration:\n$$\n\\mathrm{EC}_{50} = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\n$$\n\nThe other data points ($V_h=0.8, V_h=0.2$ and $S_b=0.8, S_b=0.2$) are consistent with a standard sigmoidal Hill-type curve centered at these median concentrations, confirming the validity of using these specific points. They are not needed for the direct calculation of $\\mathrm{TI}$ as defined.\n\nNow, we can compute the Therapeutic Index by substituting the values of $\\mathrm{CC}_{50}$ and $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ into the defining equation.\n$$\n\\mathrm{TI} = \\frac{20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}\n$$\nThe units of concentration ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) cancel, yielding a dimensionless number.\n$$\n\\mathrm{TI} = 4\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed with three significant figures.

Our computed value is $\\mathrm{TI} = 4.00$. Since $4.00  10$, this antimicrobial candidate would not be considered to have acceptable selective toxicity for systemic use based on this common criterion.

This exercise explores this principle by examining trimethoprim's inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme essential for DNA synthesis in both bacteria and humans.

A common quantitative proxy for target-selective inhibition is the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), defined as the inhibitor concentration that reduces target activity to one half of its uninhibited value under the assay’s conditions.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of pharmacology and microbiology, well-posed with a clear definition and sufficient data, and objective in its language. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\nThe problem asks for the calculation of the selectivity index for the drug trimethoprim, which inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). The selectivity index, denoted here as $SI$, quantifies the preference of an inhibitor for a target (e.g., a pathogen's enzyme) over an off-target (e.g., the host's homologous enzyme). As stated in the problem, it is the fold difference between the concentration required to inhibit the host target and the concentration required to inhibit the pathogen target. This is calculated as the ratio of their respective half-maximal inhibitory concentrations ($IC_{50}$).\n\nLet $IC_{50, \\text{human}}$ be the $IC_{50}$ for the human DHFR and $IC_{50, \\text{bacterial}}$ be the $IC_{50}$ for the *E. coli* DHFR. The selectivity index is defined as:\n$$\nSI = \\frac{IC_{50, \\text{human}}}{IC_{50, \\text{bacterial}}}\n$$\nA higher $SI$ value indicates greater selectivity for the bacterial target, which is a desirable characteristic for an antimicrobial agent.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- $IC_{50, \\text{bacterial}} = 7.20\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n- $IC_{50, \\text{human}} = 1.68\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nTo calculate the selectivity index, which must be a dimensionless quantity, the concentrations must be expressed in the same units. We will convert both values to nanomolars ($\\mathrm{nM}$).\nWe know the conversion factor is $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nFirst, convert the $IC_{50, \\text{human}}$ to $\\mathrm{nM}$:\n$$\nIC_{50, \\text{human}} = 1.68\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} \\times \\frac{1000\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = 1680\\,\\mathrm{nM}\n$$\nNow, both $IC_{50}$ values are in the same unit of $\\mathrm{nM}$:\n- $IC_{50, \\text{bacterial}} = 7.20\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n- $IC_{50, \\text{human}} = 1680\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n\nWe can now compute the selectivity index:\n$$\nSI = \\frac{1680\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{7.20\\,\\mathrm{nM}} = \\frac{1680}{7.20} \\approx 233.333...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The input values, $7.20$ and $1.68$, both have three significant figures. Therefore, the result of their division should also be reported to three significant figures.\n$$\nSI \\approx 233\n$$\nThe interpretation of this value is that trimethoprim is approximately $233$ times more potent at inhibiting the bacterial DHFR than the human DHFR. This high degree of selectivity is crucial for its clinical utility.\n\nThe problem provides the average free plasma concentration of trimethoprim as $C_{\\text{plasma}} = 1.00\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, which is equivalent to $1000\\,\\mathrm{nM}$. We can compare this clinical concentration to the $IC_{50}$ values to understand the therapeutic window.\nThe ratio of the plasma concentration to the bacterial $IC_{50}$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{C_{\\text{plasma}}}{IC_{50, \\text{bacterial}}} = \\frac{1000\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{7.20\\,\\mathrm{nM}} \\approx 139\n$$\nThis indicates that the clinical concentration is about $139$ times the concentration needed to achieve $50\\%$ inhibition of the bacterial target, suggesting that the bacterial enzyme will be very effectively inhibited.\n\nThe ratio of the plasma concentration to the human $IC_{50}$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{C_{\\text{plasma}}}{IC_{50, \\text{human}}} = \\frac{1.00\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{1.68\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} \\approx 0.595\n$$\nThis indicates that the clinical concentration is only about $60\\%$ of the concentration needed to inhibit the human enzyme by $50\\%$. Using the standard Cheng-Prusoff equation for competitive inhibition (assuming substrate concentration is much less than its Michaelis constant for simplicity), the fractional inhibition $i$ at drug concentration $[I]$ is given by $i = \\frac{[I]}{[I] + IC_{50}}$. At $[I] = 1.00\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $IC_{50, \\text{human}} = 1.68\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, the inhibition of the human enzyme is $i_{\\text{human}} = \\frac{1.00}{1.00 + 1.68} = \\frac{1.00}{2.68} \\approx 0.37$, or about $37\\%$ inhibition. This is substantially less than the near-complete inhibition of the bacterial enzyme.\n\nIn summary, the large selectivity index of $233$ allows for a therapeutic dose that maintains a plasma concentration high enough to potently inhibit the pathogen's target while being low enough to cause only minimal inhibition of the host's analogous target, thereby minimizing side effects and toxicity.

Calculation of the Selectivity Ratio**\n\nThe principle of selective toxicity is quantified by comparing the drug's affinity for its intended target (bacterial ribosome) versus its affinity for a host off-target (human cytosolic ribosome). A higher affinity corresponds to a lower equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$. The problem defines the selectivity ratio, $S$, as the ratio of the dissociation constant for the host cytosolic ribosome to that of the bacterial ribosome.\n\n$$S = \\frac{K_{d,80\\mathrm{S}}}{K_{d,70\\mathrm{S}}}$$\n\nThis ratio provides a measure of how much more weakly the antibiotic binds to human cytosolic ribosomes compared to bacterial ribosomes.

This addresses a specific side effect where the antibiotic, despite its selectivity for bacterial ribosomes over cytosolic ones, might still bind significantly to mitochondrial ribosomes due to their structural similarities to bacterial ribosomes.\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, of a receptor by a ligand at equilibrium is given by the fraction of total receptors that are bound by the ligand. For a simple binding equilibrium:\n$$R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$$\nwhere $R$ is the receptor (mitochondrial ribosome), $L$ is the ligand (antibiotic $X$), and $RL$ is the bound complex.\n\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined as:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\n\nThe total receptor concentration is $[R]_{\\mathrm{total}} = [R] + [RL]$.\nFractional occupancy is $\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}$.\n\nBy rearranging the $K_d$ expression, we get $[R] = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]}$. Substituting this into the equation for $\\theta$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{\\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]} + [RL]}$$\n\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $[RL]$ yields the standard formula for fractional occupancy:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1} = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}$$\n\nIn this context, the receptor is the human mitochondrial ribosome, so $K_d = K_{d,\\mathrm{mito}} = 1.10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.
