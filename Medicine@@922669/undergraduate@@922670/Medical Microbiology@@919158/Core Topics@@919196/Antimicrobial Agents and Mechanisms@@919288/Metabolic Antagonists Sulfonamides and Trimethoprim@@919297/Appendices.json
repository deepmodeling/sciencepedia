Sulfonamides act as metabolic antagonists of PABA, competitively inhibiting DHPS by binding to the free enzyme and preventing substrate association. Starting from the core definitions of enzyme kinetics and the steady-state approximation, consider the elementary steps for a single-substrate enzyme with a competitive inhibitor: the substrate $S$ is PABA and the inhibitor $I$ is a sulfonamide. The reaction scheme is $E + S \\rightleftharpoons ES \\rightarrow E + P$ and $E + I \\rightleftharpoons EI$, where $E$ is free enzyme, $ES$ and $EI$ are the enzyme–substrate and enzyme–inhibitor complexes, respectively. Use the steady-state approximation for $[ES]$ and $[EI]$, and the conservation of total enzyme concentration $[E_T]$, to derive the Michaelis–Menten rate law for a competitive inhibitor acting on DHPS in terms of $V_{max}$, $K_m$, $[S]$, $[I]$, and $K_i$.\n\nThen, using your derived expression, calculate the reaction velocity $v$ for DHPS when $V_{max} = 100\\,\\mathrm{nmol/min}$, $K_m = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $[PABA] = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, and inhibitor concentration $[I] = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ with an inhibition constant $K_i = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.
