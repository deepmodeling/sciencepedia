Let $D$ be the event that a neonate has the disease (congenital CMV), and let $+$ be the event that the screening test result is positive. The givens can then be expressed as probabilities:\n-   The pretest probability of having the disease is $P(D) = p$.\n-   The probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - p$.\n-   The sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive result given the disease is present: $S_e = P(+|D) = 0.97$.\n-   The specificity of the test is the probability of a negative result given the disease is absent: $S_p = P(-|D^c) = 0.99$.\n\nFrom the definition of specificity, we can determine the probability of a false positive, which is the probability of a positive test result given the disease is absent:\n$$P(+|D^c) = 1 - P(-|D^c) = 1 - S_p$$\n\nThe key quantity of interest is the posterior probability that a neonate has congenital CMV given a positive screen, denoted $P(D|+)$. This is also known as the Positive Predictive Value (PPV). According to Bayes' theorem, this is given by:\n$$P(D|+) = \\frac{P(+|D) P(D)}{P(+)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test result. We can calculate this using the law of total probability, summing over the two possible states (having the disease or not having the disease):\n$$P(+) = P(+|D) P(D) + P(+|D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the terms we have defined:\n$$P(+) = S_e \\cdot p + (1 - S_p) \\cdot (1 - p)$$\n\nNow we can write the full expression for the posterior probability $P(D|+)$ in terms of the pretest probability $p$, sensitivity $S_e$, and specificity $S_p$:\n$$P(D|+) = \\frac{S_e \\cdot p}{S_e \\cdot p + (1 - S_p) \\cdot (1 - p)}$$\n\nThe hospital policy requires that this posterior probability be at least the decision threshold $T = 0.30$. This gives us the inequality:\n$$\\frac{S_e \\cdot p}{S_e \\cdot p + (1 - S_p) \\cdot (1 - p)} \\ge T$$\n\nWe need to find the minimal pretest probability $p^{\\ast}$ that satisfies this condition. The posterior probability $P(D|+)$ is a monotonically increasing function of the pretest probability $p$ for fixed $S_e$ and $S_p$ (where $0 < S_e < 1$ and $0 < S_p < 1$). Therefore, the minimal value $p^{\\ast}$ will be the one that satisfies the equality:\n$$\\frac{S_e \\cdot p^{\\ast}}{S_e \\cdot p^{\\ast} + (1 - S_p) \\cdot (1 - p^{\\ast})} = T$$\n\nWe now solve this equation for $p^{\\ast}$ to derive the analytical expression.\n$$S_e \\cdot p^{\\ast} = T \\cdot [S_e \\cdot p^{\\ast} + (1 - S_p)(1 - p^{\\ast})]$$\n$$S_e \\cdot p^{\\ast} = T S_e p^{\\ast} + T(1 - S_p) - T(1 - S_p)p^{\\ast}$$\nNext, we group all terms containing $p^{\\ast}$ on one side of the equation:\n$$S_e \\cdot p^{\\ast} - T S_e p^{\\ast} + T(1 - S_p)p^{\\ast} = T(1 - S_p)$$\nFactor out $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$p^{\\ast} [S_e - T S_e + T(1 - S_p)] = T(1 - S_p)$$\n$$p^{\\ast} [S_e(1 - T) + T(1 - S_p)] = T(1 - S_p)$$\nFinally, we isolate $p^{\\ast}$ to obtain the desired analytical expression:\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{T(1 - S_p)}{S_e(1 - T) + T(1 - S_p)}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided in the problem:\n-   $S_e = 0.97$\n-   $S_p = 0.99$\n-   $T = 0.30$\n\nWe calculate the terms in the expression:\n-   $1 - S_p = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01$\n-   $1 - T = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.30 \\cdot (0.01)}{0.97 \\cdot (0.70) + 0.30 \\cdot (0.01)}$$\nCalculate the numerator and denominator:\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.003}{0.679 + 0.003}$$\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.003}{0.682}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$p^{\\ast} \\approx 0.004398826979...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
