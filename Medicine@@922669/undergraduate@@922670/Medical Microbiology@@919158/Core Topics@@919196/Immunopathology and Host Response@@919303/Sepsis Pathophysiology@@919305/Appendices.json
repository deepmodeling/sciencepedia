Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded exercise in applying clinical scoring systems and definitions. The solution will proceed.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires a systematic calculation of the SOFA score at two time points, followed by the application of Sepsis-3 definitions.\n\n**2.1. Calculation of the Baseline SOFA Score**\n\nThe SOFA score is the sum of scores from six organ systems, each graded from a score of $0$ to $4$.\n\n*   **Respiration**: The $\\text{PaO}_2/\\text{FiO}_2$ ratio is calculated.\n    $$ \\frac{\\text{PaO}_2}{\\text{FiO}_2} = \\frac{90 \\, \\text{mmHg}}{0.21} \\approx 428.6 \\, \\text{mmHg} $$\n    A ratio $\\ge 400$ corresponds to a SOFA score of $0$.\n*   **Coagulation**: The platelet count is $220 \\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$. A count $\\ge 150 \\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ corresponds to a SOFA score of $0$.\n*   **Liver**: The total bilirubin is $0.8 \\ \\text{mg/dL}$. A level $ 1.2 \\ \\text{mg/dL}$ corresponds to a SOFA score of $0$.\n*   **Cardiovascular**: The MAP is $82 \\ \\text{mmHg}$, and the patient is not receiving vasopressors. A MAP $\\ge 70 \\ \\text{mmHg}$ corresponds to a SOFA score of $0$.\n*   **Central Nervous System (CNS)**: The GCS is $15$. This corresponds to a SOFA score of $0$.\n*   **Renal**: The serum creatinine is $1.0 \\ \\text{mg/dL}$, and the urine output is $1800$ mL/day. A creatinine level $ 1.2 \\ \\text{mg/dL}$ corresponds to a SOFA score of $0$.\n\nThe total baseline SOFA score is the sum of the individual scores:\n$$ \\mathrm{SOFA}_{\\text{baseline}} = 0_{\\text{resp}} + 0_{\\text{coag}} + 0_{\\text{liver}} + 0_{\\text{cardio}} + 0_{\\text{CNS}} + 0_{\\text{renal}} = 0 $$\nThe patient's baseline SOFA score is assumed to be $0$, which is consistent with the provided data indicating no pre-existing organ dysfunction.\n\n**2.2. Calculation of the Current SOFA Score**\n\n*   **Respiration**: The patient is mechanically ventilated. The $\\text{PaO}_2/\\text{FiO}_2$ ratio is:\n    $$ \\frac{\\text{PaO}_2}{\\text{FiO}_2} = \\frac{70 \\, \\text{mmHg}}{0.50} = 140 \\, \\text{mmHg} $$\n    A ratio $ 200$ and $\\ge 100$ on respiratory support corresponds to a SOFA score of $3$.\n*   **Coagulation**: The platelet count is $65 \\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$. A count $ 100 \\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ and $\\ge 50 \\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ corresponds to a SOFA score of $2$.\n*   **Liver**: The total bilirubin is $3.2 \\ \\text{mg/dL}$. A level $\\ge 2.0 \\ \\text{mg/dL}$ and $ 6.0 \\ \\text{mg/dL}$ corresponds to a SOFA score of $2$.\n*   **Cardiovascular**: The MAP is $68 \\ \\text{mmHg}$ while on a norepinephrine infusion of $0.08 \\ \\mu\\text{g/kg/min}$. The use of norepinephrine at a rate $\\le 0.1 \\ \\mu\\text{g/kg/min}$ corresponds to a SOFA score of $3$. This criterion supersedes the score for MAP alone.\n*   **Central Nervous System (CNS)**: The GCS is $11$. A GCS of $10-12$ corresponds to a SOFA score of $2$.\n*   **Renal**: The serum creatinine is $2.8 \\ \\text{mg/dL}$, and the urine output is $450 \\ \\text{mL/day}$.\n    *   A creatinine level of $2.8 \\ \\text{mg/dL}$ (in the range $2.0-3.4 \\ \\text{mg/dL}$) corresponds to a score of $2$.\n    *   A urine output of $450 \\ \\text{mL/day}$ (oliguria, $ 500 \\ \\text{mL/day}$) corresponds to a score of $3$.\n    The higher of the two scores is taken for the renal system, so the score is $3$.\n\nThe total current SOFA score is:\n$$ \\mathrm{SOFA}_{\\text{current}} = 3_{\\text{resp}} + 2_{\\text{coag}} + 2_{\\text{liver}} + 3_{\\text{cardio}} + 2_{\\text{CNS}} + 3_{\\text{renal}} = 15 $$\n\n**2.3. Calculation of the Change in SOFA Score ($\\Delta\\mathrm{SOFA}$)**\n\nThe change in SOFA score is the current score minus the baseline score.\n$$ \\Delta\\mathrm{SOFA} = \\mathrm{SOFA}_{\\text{current}} - \\mathrm{SOFA}_{\\text{baseline}} = 15 - 0 = 15 $$\n\n**2.4. Sepsis-3 Clinical Classification**\n\n*   **Sepsis**: According to Sepsis-3, sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Operationally, this is identified by a suspected infection plus an acute increase in the total SOFA score of $\\ge 2$ points.\n    *   The patient has a documented infection (`Streptococcus pneumoniae`).\n    *   The acute change in SOFA score is $\\Delta\\mathrm{SOFA} = 15$, which is $\\ge 2$.\n    *   Thus, the patient meets the criteria for **sepsis**.\n\n*   **Septic Shock**: Sepsis-3 defines septic shock as a subset of sepsis with profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities. The clinical criteria are:\n    1.  Persistent hypotension requiring vasopressors to maintain a MAP $\\ge 65 \\ \\text{mmHg}$.\n    2.  A serum lactate level $> 2 \\ \\text{mmol/L}$ ($>18 \\ \\text{mg/dL}$).\n    3.  These conditions must be present despite adequate volume resuscitation.\n    *   The patient has received adequate fluid resuscitation ($>30 \\ \\text{mL/kg}$).\n    *   The patient requires norepinephrine (a vasopressor) to maintain a MAP of $68 \\ \\text{mmHg}$ (which is $\\ge 65 \\ \\text{mmHg}$).\n    *   The serum lactate level is $3.5 \\ \\text{mmol/L}$, which is $> 2 \\ \\text{mmol/L}$.\n    *   All criteria are met. Thus, the patient meets the criteria for **septic shock**.\n\n**2.5. Determination of the Code C**\n\nBased on the classification:\n*   $C=0$ for no sepsis.\n*   $C=1$ for sepsis without shock.\n*   $C=2$ for septic shock.\nSince the patient has septic shock, the code is $C=2$.\n\n**2.6. Final Calculation of the Scalar Code $\\Xi$**\n\nThe final code is calculated using the given formula:\n$$ \\Xi = 100 \\cdot \\Delta\\mathrm{SOFA} + C $$\nSubstituting the derived values:\n$$ \\Xi = 100 \\cdot (15) + 2 $$\n$$ \\Xi = 1500 + 2 = 1502 $$\nThe final scalar code is $1502$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1502}$$", "id": "4674474"}]}
