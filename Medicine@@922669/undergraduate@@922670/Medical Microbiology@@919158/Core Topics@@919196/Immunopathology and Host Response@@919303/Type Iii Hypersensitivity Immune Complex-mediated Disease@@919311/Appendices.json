The key is to analyze the antigen-to-antibody ratio at the time of each infusion.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the First Infusion (Day 0):** The patient is immunologically naive, with no pre-existing anti-antitoxin antibodies (IgG = 0, IgM = 0). The infusion of the antigen (the heterologous antitoxin) will initiate a primary immune response, but no immune complexes can form. Therefore, no immediate Type III reaction is expected. The development of an antibody response takes 7-14 days.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Second Infusion (Day 10):** A second dose of antigen is given (peak $[Ag] \\approx 200$ AU/mL). By this time, a primary immune response has generated moderate levels of antibody (IgM = 80, IgG = 30; total $[Ab] = 110$ AU/mL). The system is in a state of relative **antigen excess** ($[Ag] > [Ab]$). This condition favors the formation of small-to-intermediate sized, soluble immune complexes. These complexes are not efficiently cleared by the mononuclear phagocyte system, allowing them to circulate and deposit in tissues with high blood flow and filtration pressure (e.g., skin, joints, kidneys). This deposition activates the classical complement pathway, leading to consumption of C3 and C4 (hypocomplementemia) and triggering neutrophil-mediated inflammation. This causes the classic signs of systemic serum sickness: fever, urticarial rash, and arthralgia, typically developing within a few days after the antigen challenge.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Third Infusion (Day 24):** A third dose of antigen is given (peak $[Ag] \\approx 200$ AU/mL). The patient now has a very high titer of specific IgG (500 AU/mL) due to a robust secondary (memory) immune response. The system is in a state of significant **antibody excess** ($[Ab] \\gg [Ag]$). This leads to the rapid formation of very large immune complexes. These large lattices are opsonized and very efficiently cleared from the circulation by phagocytes in the liver and spleen via Fc and complement receptors. Because the complexes are cleared before they can deposit in tissues, widespread systemic inflammation is averted. Consequently, minimal to no systemic symptoms are expected, and complement levels should remain near normal.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **Option A** correctly predicts serum sickness with hypocomplementemia after the second infusion (due to antigen excess) and minimal symptoms with rapid clearance after the third infusion (due to antibody excess). This matches our analysis.\n*   **Option B** is incorrect because no reaction would occur after the first infusion in a naive patient.\n*   **Option C** is incorrect. High antibody titers on day 24 lead to *less*, not more, severe disease. It also wrongly states that IgM is ineffective.\n*   **Option D** is incorrect. Intravenous administration causes systemic serum sickness, not a localized Arthus reaction.\n*   **Option E** is incorrect because IgM is a highly potent activator of the classical complement pathway, and complement consumption is expected.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the most accurate prediction of the clinical and laboratory course.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4685594"}]}
