A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the expected number of established trophozoites as a function of the number of ingested cysts, $N$. We are instructed to use the linearity of expectation.\n\nLet $X$ be the random variable representing the total number of established trophozoites. The total number of ingested cysts is $N$. Each cyst contains $2$ trophozoites. Therefore, the total number of potential trophozoites is $2N$.\n\nLet us define an indicator random variable $I_k$ for each of the $2N$ potential trophozoites, where $k$ ranges from $1$ to $2N$. We define $I_k = 1$ if the $k$-th trophozoite successfully establishes colonization, and $I_k = 0$ otherwise.\n\nThe total number of established trophozoites is the sum of these indicator variables:\n$$X = \\sum_{k=1}^{2N} I_k$$\n\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected value of $X$ is the sum of the expected values of the individual indicator variables:\n$$E[X] = E\\left[\\sum_{k=1}^{2N} I_k\\right] = \\sum_{k=1}^{2N} E[I_k]$$\n\nThe expectation of an indicator variable is equal to the probability of the event it indicates. Thus, $E[I_k] = P(I_k = 1)$.\n\nFor any single trophozoite to establish colonization (i.e., for $I_k = 1$), a sequence of independent events must occur:\n1.  Its parent cyst must be viable (event with probability $V$).\n2.  The viable cyst must survive gastric transit (event with probability $S$).\n3.  The surviving cyst must successfully excyst to release the trophozoite (event with probability $E$).\n4.  The released trophozoite must establish colonization (event with probability $A$).\n\nThe problem statement specifies that the probability of a trophozoite establishing colonization, $A$, is for a *released* trophozoite. Therefore, the unconditional probability of a single potential trophozoite establishing colonization is the product of the probabilities of the prerequisite events leading to its release and its subsequent colonization.\n\nLet $P_{\\text{estab}}$ be the probability that any single potential trophozoite establishes colonization. This is $P(I_k=1)$.\n$$P_{\\text{estab}} = P(\\text{Viability} \\cap \\text{Survival} \\cap \\text{Excystation} \\cap \\text{Colonization})$$\nSince viability, survival, and excystation are independent events for the cyst, and colonization is dependent on their successful completion, we can write the joint probability:\n$$P_{\\text{estab}} = P(\\text{Viability}) \\times P(\\text{Survival}) \\times P(\\text{Excystation}) \\times P(\\text{Colonization | Release})$$\nSubstituting the symbolic probabilities:\n$$P_{\\text{estab}} = V \\cdot S \\cdot E \\cdot A$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$V = \\frac{9}{10}, \\quad S = \\frac{7}{10}, \\quad E = \\frac{4}{5}, \\quad A = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$P_{\\text{estab}} = \\frac{9}{10} \\times \\frac{7}{10} \\times \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$P_{\\text{estab}} = \\frac{9 \\times 7 \\times 4 \\times 1}{10 \\times 10 \\times 5 \\times 2} = \\frac{252}{1000} = \\frac{63}{250}$$\nSo, the expectation for any single indicator variable is $E[I_k] = \\frac{63}{250}$.\n\nSince all cysts and all trophozoites are treated under identical and independent assumptions, the expectation $E[I_k]$ is the same for all $k = 1, \\dots, 2N$.\n\nWe can now calculate the total expected number of established trophozoites, $E[X]$:\n$$E[X] = \\sum_{k=1}^{2N} E[I_k] = \\sum_{k=1}^{2N} \\frac{63}{250}$$\n$$E[X] = 2N \\cdot \\frac{63}{250}$$\n$$E[X] = N \\cdot \\frac{126}{250}$$\nSimplifying the fraction gives:\n$$E[X] = N \\cdot \\frac{63}{125}$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the expected initial colonization load as a function of $N$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{63N}{125}}\n$$", "id": "4790712"}, {"introduction": "Diagnosing giardiasis often relies on identifying cysts in stool samples, but how does a reported concentration translate to what is seen under a microscope?

To find the relationship between the initial cyst concentration, $N(0)$, and the concentration at a later time, $N(t)$, we must solve this differential equation. We can separate the variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{N} = -k(T) C \\, dt\n$$\nNext, we integrate both sides. The concentration of cysts changes from $N(0)$ at $t=0$ to $N(t)$ at time $t$. Since $k(T)$ and $C$ are constant with respect to time, the integration is as follows:\n$$\n\\int_{N(0)}^{N(t)} \\frac{1}{N} dN = \\int_{0}^{t} -k(T) C \\, dt\n$$\n$$\n[\\ln(N)]_{N(0)}^{N(t)} = -k(T) C [t]_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(N(t)) - \\ln(N(0)) = -k(T) C t\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, we get:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N(0)}\\right) = -k(T) C t\n$$\nThe problem defines the concentration-time product as $Ct = C \\cdot t$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N(0)}\\right) = -k(T) (Ct)\n$$\nThe problem also specifies an $L$ $\\log_{10}$ reduction, defined by the relation $N(t)/N(0) = 10^{-L}$.
