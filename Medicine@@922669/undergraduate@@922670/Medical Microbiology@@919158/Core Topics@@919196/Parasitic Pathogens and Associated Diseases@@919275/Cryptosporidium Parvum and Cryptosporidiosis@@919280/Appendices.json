The tasks involve organizing the provided data, calculating attack rates (AR) and a risk ratio (RR), and making an inference about the most likely transmission route. The analysis will proceed by systematically applying standard epidemiological definitions.\n\nThe core epidemiological measures to be used are the attack rate and the risk ratio.\nThe attack rate ($AR$) is the proportion of a population at risk that develops a disease during a specific time period. It is calculated as:\n$$AR = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases in the population}}{\\text{Number of persons at risk in the population}}$$\nThe risk ratio ($RR$), also known as the relative risk, compares the risk of a health event (disease) among one group with the risk among another group.

This indicates that the risk of developing cryptosporidiosis was $3.5$ times higher for diapered toddlers who participated in the wading-pool water-play compared to those who did not. This is a strong association. For the toilet-trained preschoolers, the risk ratio is $RR_{TP, WP} = \\frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2.0$, also indicating an elevated risk. The combination of a strong statistical association ($RR = 3.5$) in the most susceptible population (diapered toddlers) and the known biological plausibility—that *Cryptosporidium* oocysts are resistant to chlorination and frequently transmitted via recreational water—points to the wading pool as the most likely predominant route of transmission in this outbreak. The cases among non-exposed individuals likely represent secondary person-to-person transmission, which is also common with this pathogen.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of the risk ratio for diapered toddlers, rounded to $4$ significant figures.\nThe calculated value is exactly $3.5$.

Then, classify the diarrhea as osmotic or secretory using the following widely accepted thresholds: a stool osmotic gap less than $50$ milliosmoles per kilogram indicates secretory diarrhea, whereas a stool osmotic gap greater than $100$ milliosmoles per kilogram indicates osmotic diarrhea; intermediate values suggest mixed mechanisms.

It represents the concentration of unmeasured, osmotically active substances in the fecal water. The SOG is defined as the difference between the measured stool osmolality and the estimated osmolality contributed by the major electrolytes.\n\nThe estimated electrolyte osmolality is calculated based on the concentrations of sodium ($[\\text{Na}^+]$) and potassium ($[\\text{K}^+]$) ions. In a solution under macroscopic electroneutrality, the total positive charge from cations must be balanced by an equal amount of negative charge from anions. The standard clinical approximation, consistent with the problem's premise of \"ideal dissociation of monovalent strong electrolytes,\" assumes that the primary electrolytes are monovalent salts (e.g., $\\text{NaCl}$, $\\text{KCl}$). Therefore, the total concentration of osmotically active electrolyte particles is estimated as twice the sum of the major measured cation concentrations. The factor of $2$ accounts for the balancing anions (e.g., $\\text{Cl}^-$, $\\text{HCO}_3^-$) that are osmotically active but not typically included in the routine gap calculation.\n\nThe formula for the stool osmotic gap is:\n$$\n\\text{SOG} = Osm_{measured} - 2 \\times ([\\text{Na}^+] + [\\text{K}^+])\n$$\nwhere $Osm_{measured}$ is the measured stool osmolality, and $[\\text{Na}^+]$ and $[\\text{K}^+]$ are the stool concentrations of sodium and potassium, respectively.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n-   $Osm_{measured} = 302 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$\n-   $[\\text{Na}^+] = 96 \\text{ mmol/L}$\n-   $[\\text{K}^+] = 38 \\text{ mmol/L}$\n\nIt is a standard convention in clinical chemistry to treat concentrations in millimoles per liter ($\\text{mmol/L}$) as numerically equivalent to their contribution in milliosmoles per kilogram ($\\text{mOsm/kg}$) for dilute aqueous solutions like stool water, where the density of the solvent is approximately $1 \\text{ kg/L}$.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$\n\\text{SOG} = 302 - 2 \\times (96 + 38)\n$$\nFirst, calculate the sum of the cation concentrations:\n$$\n[\\text{Na}^+] + [\\text{K}^+] = 96 + 38 = 134 \\text{ mmol/L}\n$$\nNext, calculate the estimated electrolyte contribution to osmolality:\n$$\n2 \\times 134 = 268 \\text{ mOsm/kg}\n$$\nFinally, calculate the stool osmotic gap:\n$$\n\\text{SOG} = 302 - 268 = 34 \\text{ mOsm/kg}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

Since $34.00  50$, the diarrhea is classified as **secretory**.

The rate of change of viable oocysts with time, $t$, is therefore described by the following second-order rate law:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = -k C N $$\nwhere $k$ is the second-order rate constant.\n\nIn a typical disinfection scenario within a contact chamber, the disinfectant concentration $C$ is maintained at a constant value. We can therefore solve this differential equation by separation of variables.\n$$ \\frac{dN}{N} = -k C \\, dt $$\nWe integrate this equation from the initial time $t=0$, where the number of oocysts is $N_0$, to a final time $t$, where the number of oocysts is $N_t$.\n$$ \\int_{N_0}^{N_t} \\frac{1}{N} \\, dN = \\int_0^t -k C \\, dt $$\nSince $k$ and $C$ are constant over the integration period, this yields:\n$$ [\\ln(N)]_{N_0}^{N_t} = -k C [t]_0^t $$\n$$ \\ln(N_t) - \\ln(N_0) = -k C t $$\nThis can be written in terms of the survival ratio, $\\frac{N_t}{N_0}$:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_t}{N_0}\\right) = -k (Ct) $$\nThe problem requires the result in terms of base-$10$ log inactivation, denoted here as $L$. The base-$10$ log inactivation is defined as:\n$$ L = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_0}{N_t}\\right) = -\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_t}{N_0}\\right) $$\nTo relate the natural logarithm to the base-$10$ logarithm, we use the change of base formula: $\\ln(x) = \\ln(10) \\log_{10}(x)$. Applying this to our integrated rate law:\n$$ \\ln(10) \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_t}{N_0}\\right) = -k (Ct) $$\nSubstituting the definition of $L$:\n$$ \\ln(10) (-L) = -k (Ct) $$\n$$ L \\ln(10) = k (Ct) $$\nThe problem asks for an expression that links the rate constant $k$ to a known $Ct$ value and a specified base-$10$ log inactivation $L$. Rearranging the above equation gives the desired expression:\n$$ k = \\frac{L \\ln(10)}{Ct} $$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Log Inactivation**\n\nThe problem provides a reference data point: a $L_{ref} = 2.0$-log inactivation is achieved at a $Ct$ product of $(Ct)_{ref} = 7200 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\, min \\, L^{-1}}$ under the same $pH$ and temperature conditions. Since $k$ depends on these conditions, we can assume $k$ is the same for the reference case and the plant's operational case.\n\nFrom the relationship $L \\ln(10) = k (Ct)$, it is clear that for a constant $k$, the log inactivation $L$ is directly proportional to the $Ct$ product. We can write this as a ratio:\n$$ \\frac{L_{plant}}{(Ct)_{plant}} = \\frac{k}{\\ln(10)} = \\frac{L_{ref}}{(Ct)_{ref}} $$\nRearranging to solve for the log inactivation at the plant, $L_{plant}$:\n$$ L_{plant} = L_{ref} \\frac{(Ct)_{plant}}{(Ct)_{ref}} $$\nThis relationship shows that we do not need to explicitly calculate the value of $k$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the $Ct$ product for the plant's operating conditions:\n-   Chlorine concentration $C_{plant} = 1.0 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\, L^{-1}}$\n-   Contact time $t_{plant} = 30 \\ \\mathrm{min}$\n$$ (Ct)_{plant} = C_{plant} \\times t_{plant} = (1.0 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\, L^{-1}}) \\times (30 \\ \\mathrm{min}) = 30 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\, min \\, L^{-1}} $$\nNow, we can calculate the expected log inactivation $L_{plant}$ using the reference values:\n-   Reference log inactivation $L_{ref} = 2.0$\n-   Reference $Ct$ product $(Ct)_{ref} = 7200 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\, min \\, L^{-1}}$\n$$ L_{plant} = 2.0 \\times \\frac{30 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\, min \\, L^{-1}}}{7200 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\, min \\, L^{-1}}} $$\n$$ L_{plant} = 2.0 \\times \\frac{30}{7200} = 2.0 \\times \\frac{1}{240} = \\frac{2}{240} = \\frac{1}{120} $$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal and rounding to three significant figures:\n$$ L_{plant} = \\frac{1}{120} \\approx 0.0083333... $$\n$$ L_{plant} \\approx 0.00833 $$\n\n**Part 3: Mechanistic Justification for Chlorine Resistance**\n\nThe limited efficacy of free chlorine against *Cryptosporidium parvum* oocysts, as demonstrated by the very high required $Ct$ value of $7200 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\, min \\, L^{-1}}$ for a mere $2.0$-log kill, is primarily due to the unique structure of the oocyst wall. This wall is a robust, multi-layered barrier that protects the infective sporozoites inside.\n\nMechanistically, free chlorine (predominantly as hypochlorous acid, $HOCl$, at $pH=7$) acts by oxidizing vital cellular components. However, to be effective, the disinfectant must first penetrate the oocyst wall to reach these targets. The *C. parvum* oocyst wall is exceptionally impermeable to chemical oxidants. It is composed of a tough outer layer and a thick inner layer containing highly cross-linked proteins. This structure serves as a formidable physical and chemical barrier, consuming large amounts of the disinfectant before any significant damage can be inflicted upon the internal sporozoites. Consequently, the rate of penetration and reaction with critical internal sites is extremely slow, necessitating either very high chlorine concentrations or very long contact times to achieve effective inactivation, resulting in the observed high $Ct$ values.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.00833}$$", "id": "4625234"}]}
