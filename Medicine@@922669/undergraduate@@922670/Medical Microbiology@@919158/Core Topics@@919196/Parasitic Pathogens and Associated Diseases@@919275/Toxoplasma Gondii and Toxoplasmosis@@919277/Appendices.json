It uses prevalence as a probability, the Poisson distribution for modeling rare, discrete events (cysts in a volume), and a logistic (sigmoidal) function for dose-response or inactivation, all of which are established methods in this field. The context of *Toxoplasma gondii* transmission through undercooked pork is a well-documented public health concern. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and assumptions to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The parameters given are dimensionally consistent and physically plausible for such a model. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet $I$ be the event that a human host becomes infected from consuming a single serving of pork. Let $A$ be the event that the serving of pork is from an infected animal. The prevalence $p$ is the probability of this event, so $P(A) = p$. The event that the serving is from an uninfected animal is $A^c$, with probability $P(A^c) = 1-p$.\n\nBy the law of total probability, the overall probability of infection $P(I)$ is:\n$$P(I) = P(I|A)P(A) + P(I|A^c)P(A^c)$$\nIf the serving is from an uninfected animal (event $A^c$), there are no tissue cysts. Since infection requires at least one viable cyst, the probability of infection in this case is zero: $P(I|A^c) = 0$.\nThe expression for the total probability of infection simplifies to:\n$$P(I) = P(I|A)P(A) = p \\cdot P(I|A)$$\nNow, we must find $P(I|A)$, the conditional probability of infection given that the serving is from an infected animal.\n\nLet $N$ be the random variable representing the number of cysts in an infected serving. According to the problem statement, $N$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda = s \\cdot c$. The probability mass function for $N$ is:\n$$P(N=n) = \\frac{\\lambda^n e^{-\\lambda}}{n!} \\quad \\text{for } n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$$\nLet $V$ be the random variable for the number of viable cysts remaining after cooking. Infection occurs if and only if $V \\ge 1$. It is more convenient to calculate the complementary probability, $P(V=0)$, and then use the relation $P(V \\ge 1) = 1 - P(V=0)$.\n\nThe probability that a single cyst survives cooking is $p_{survive} = 1 - f(T)$, where $f(T)$ is the kill fraction. The probability that a single cyst is inactivated is $f(T)$.\n\nTo find the probability of zero viable cysts, $P(V=0|A)$, we can sum over all possible initial numbers of cysts, $n$:\n$$P(V=0|A) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} P(V=0 | N=n) P(N=n)$$\nGiven $n$ initial cysts, the event of each cyst being inactivated is independent. The probability that all $n$ cysts are inactivated is $(f(T))^n$. Thus, $P(V=0 | N=n) = (f(T))^n$.\nSubstituting this and the Poisson probability into the summation:\n$$P(V=0|A) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (f(T))^n \\cdot \\frac{\\lambda^n e^{-\\lambda}}{n!}$$\nWe can rearrange the terms:\n$$P(V=0|A) = e^{-\\lambda} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\lambda f(T))^n}{n!}$$\nThe summation term is the Maclaurin series for the exponential function, $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^k}{k!} = e^x$. With $x = \\lambda f(T)$, the sum evaluates to $\\exp(\\lambda f(T))$.\nTherefore, the probability of having zero viable cysts given an infected serving is:\n$$P(V=0|A) = e^{-\\lambda} \\exp(\\lambda f(T)) = \\exp(-\\lambda + \\lambda f(T)) = \\exp(-\\lambda(1-f(T)))$$\nThe probability of infection, given an infected serving, is the probability of having at least one viable cyst:\n$$P(I|A) = P(V \\ge 1|A) = 1 - P(V=0|A) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda(1-f(T)))$$\nSubstituting $\\lambda=sc$:\n$$P(I|A) = 1 - \\exp(-sc(1-f(T)))$$\nFinally, the overall probability of infection $P(I)$ is:\n$$P(I) = p \\cdot P(I|A) = p \\left[ 1 - \\exp(-sc(1-f(T))) \\right]$$\nThis is the general expression for the probability of infection.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the given parameters:\n$p = 0.05$\n$s = 120$\n$c = 0.03$\n$k = 0.5$\n$T_{50} = 60$\n$T = 58$\n\nFirst, calculate the mean number of cysts in an infected serving, $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = s \\cdot c = 120 \\times 0.03 = 3.6$$\nNext, calculate the thermal kill fraction $f(T)$ at $T=58^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$:\n$$f(58) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-k(T - T_{50}))} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-0.5(58 - 60))}$$\n$$f(58) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-0.5(-2))} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(1)}$$\nThe probability that a single cyst survives is $1-f(T)$:\n$$1 - f(58) = 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(1)} = \\frac{1 + \\exp(1) - 1}{1 + \\exp(1)} = \\frac{\\exp(1)}{1 + \\exp(1)}$$\nNow, substitute these into the expression for $P(I)$:\n$$P(I) = 0.05 \\left[ 1 - \\exp\\left(-3.6 \\left(\\frac{\\exp(1)}{1 + \\exp(1)}\\right)\\right) \\right]$$\nLet's compute the value of the argument of the outer exponential:\n$$-3.6 \\left(\\frac{\\exp(1)}{1 + \\exp(1)}\\right) \\approx -3.6 \\times \\left(\\frac{2.71828}{1 + 2.71828}\\right) \\approx -3.6 \\times 0.73105858 \\approx -2.63181088$$\nNow, compute the exponential term:\n$$\\exp(-2.63181088) \\approx 0.0719435$$\nNext, calculate the term in the brackets:\n$$1 - 0.0719435 \\approx 0.9280565$$\nFinally, multiply by the prevalence $p$:\n$$P(I) = 0.05 \\times 0.9280565 \\approx 0.046402825$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The fundamental base is:\n\n- Upon primary exposure to a T-dependent antigen such as Toxoplasma gondii, naive B cells mount an early plasmablast response dominated by low-affinity IgM, typically appearing within approximately $1$–$2$ weeks.\n- With T cell help, B cells undergo class-switch recombination to IgG and enter germinal centers where somatic hypermutation and selection produce progressively higher-affinity clones; this process increases binding strength (avidity) of IgG over time. High avidity typically emerges after approximately $12$–$16$ weeks following infection, while low avidity predominates in the first several weeks to a few months.\n- IgG, once produced, usually persists for life, while IgM often persists for months and can occasionally remain detectable beyond $6$–$12$ months. IgM assays are prone to false positives from nonspecific binding, polyclonal activation, and interference (for example, rheumatoid factor).\n- Therefore, single time-point serology must integrate the kinetics of appearance and maturation (IgM first, then IgG with increasing avidity), the persistence of IgM, and the potential for assay artifacts.\n\nFrom these principles, we derive how to interpret the proposed rules:\n\nOption A: “In a single time-point sample during early pregnancy, high IgG avidity in the presence of detectable IgM most reliably excludes infection acquired within the preceding $12$ weeks.”\n- Derivation: High IgG avidity reflects successful affinity maturation in germinal centers, which requires time on the order of weeks to months. Detectable IgM can persist for many months after the acute phase or be falsely positive. The decisive discriminator in a single sample is high IgG avidity, which strongly argues that the infection was not acquired recently. Most validated avidity assays consider high avidity to exclude infection within approximately the preceding $12$–$16$ weeks. The presence of IgM does not negate this exclusion because IgM can be persistent or nonspecific.\n- Verdict: Correct.\n\nOption B: “Any positive IgM, regardless of IgG or avidity results, confirms infection within the preceding $2$ weeks.”\n- Derivation: IgM may appear early, but it is not specific for infection within the preceding $2$ weeks. IgM can persist for months ($\\geq 6$–$12$ months in some cases) and can be falsely positive. Without considering IgG and avidity, this rule overcalls acute infection and ignores the known pitfalls.\n- Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption C: “Low IgG avidity with concomitant IgG positivity indicates infection within the preceding $3$ months, but may persist beyond $4$ months; therefore, interpretation should be corroborated by repeat testing to demonstrate rising IgG titers or IgG seroconversion.”\n- Derivation: Low IgG avidity indicates that germinal center affinity maturation is incomplete, consistent with recent infection. Many assays use low avidity to suggest infection within approximately the last $3$ months, though low avidity can occasionally persist longer (for example, up to $\\sim 4$ months or more) depending on host and assay factors. Because low avidity is not perfectly specific for “very recent” infection and can have assay variability, the prudent approach is corroboration via paired sera showing IgG seroconversion (transition from negative to positive) or a significant rise in IgG titers over a defined interval (for example, $2$–$3$ weeks). This rule integrates the kinetics and acknowledges pitfalls.\n- Verdict: Correct.\n\nOption D: “The absence of IgM with positive IgG and high avidity implies chronic infection and is consistent with immunity from past exposure.”\n- Derivation: If IgG is present and shows high avidity, the immune response has undergone affinity maturation long ago, and the absence of IgM removes concern for very recent acquisition. IgG persistence is lifelong, so this profile is characteristic of past infection. This is the classical pattern of immunity from prior exposure.\n- Verdict: Correct.\n\nOption E: “Positive IgM with negative IgG necessarily indicates a false positive due to rheumatoid factor and should be disregarded.”\n- Derivation: Positive IgM with negative IgG can occur very early in infection, before IgG appears, and thus is not necessarily a false positive. While false-positive IgM may be caused by rheumatoid factor and other interferences, “necessarily” is incorrect. Such a pattern should prompt confirmatory testing (repeat serology to assess for IgG seroconversion, alternative IgM assays with rheumatoid factor absorption steps, or molecular testing in relevant clinical contexts), rather than automatic dismissal.\n- Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the scientifically valid rules among the options are A, C, and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "4700393"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice challenges you to apply your knowledge in a complex, high-stakes clinical scenario.

The leading differential diagnosis for multiple ring-enhancing brain lesions in this context includes:\n1.  **Toxoplasmic Encephalitis (TE)**: The most common etiology.

An aggressive, high-grade B-cell lymphoma, strongly associated with EBV in the setting of HIV.\n3.  **Other Infections**: Less commonly, pyogenic (bacterial) abscesses, tuberculomas, fungal abscesses (cryptococcomas, aspergillomas), or neurocysticercosis.\n4.  **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)**: Caused by JC virus. Typically presents with non-enhancing white matter lesions without significant mass effect; ring enhancement is atypical.\n\nThe provided data points strongly favor toxoplasmic encephalitis:\n\n-   **Lesion Pattern**: Multiple lesions in the basal ganglia and corticomedullary junction are classic for TE. PCNSL more often presents as a solitary, larger, periventricular lesion, although this is not absolute.\n-   **Serology**: Positive *T. gondii* IgG is necessary for reactivation disease; over $95\\%$ of AIDS patients with TE are IgG positive. Negative IgM rules out acute primary infection.\n-   **CSF Analysis**: Negative CSF EBV DNA PCR has a high negative predictive value (>$95\\%$) for excluding PCNSL in patients with AIDS.\n-   **Advanced Imaging**:\n    -   **SPECT/PET**: TE lesions are inflammatory and typically show low metabolic activity, resulting in low uptake on thallium-$201$ SPECT and hypometabolism on FDG-PET. In contrast, PCNSL is a highly cellular tumor and demonstrates high metabolic activity (high uptake on both SPECT and PET). The patient's findings (low uptake) are characteristic of TE.\n    -   **MR Spectroscopy**: TE lesions are necrotic and inflammatory, showing elevated lipid and lactate peaks. PCNSL, a tumor with high cell membrane turnover, typically shows a markedly elevated choline peak. The patient's findings (lipid-lactate peaks, low choline) are strongly suggestive of TE.\n    -   **DWI**: Pyogenic abscesses contain thick, viscous pus that restricts the motion of water molecules, leading to marked central restricted diffusion (bright signal on DWI). The absence of this finding in the patient argues against a pyogenic abscess.\n-   **Therapeutic Response**: A positive clinical and radiographic response to empiric anti-toxoplasma therapy within $10-14$ days is considered diagnostic confirmation of TE.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, the patient's presentation is overwhelmingly consistent with toxoplasmic encephalitis.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A.
