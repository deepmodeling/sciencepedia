We may proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the General Expression for Concentration $C(t)$**\n\nThe problem states that the instantaneous inactivation rate is proportional to the current viable concentration. The inactivation rate is the rate of decrease of concentration, which can be expressed as $-\\frac{dC}{dt}$. Alternatively, the rate of change of concentration, $\\frac{dC}{dt}$, is proportional to $-C(t)$. This relationship is formulated as a first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -\\delta C(t)\n$$\nHere, $\\delta$ is the positive constant of proportionality, representing the inactivation rate constant. To solve this differential equation, we can use the method of separation of variables.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{C(t)} dC = -\\delta dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{C(t)} dC = \\int -\\delta dt\n$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\n\\ln|C(t)| = -\\delta t + K\n$$\nwhere $K$ is the constant of integration. Since concentration $C(t)$ must be a non-negative quantity, we can drop the absolute value bars. We can solve for $C(t)$ by exponentiating both sides:\n$$\nC(t) = \\exp(-\\delta t + K) = \\exp(K) \\exp(-\\delta t)\n$$\nLet $A = \\exp(K)$. The general solution is:\n$$\nC(t) = A \\exp(-\\delta t)\n$$\nTo find the specific solution, we apply the initial condition $C(0) = C_{0}$.\n$$\nC(0) = A \\exp(-\\delta \\cdot 0) = A \\exp(0) = A\n$$\nThus, the integration constant $A$ is equal to the initial concentration $C_{0}$. Substituting this back into the general solution, we obtain the expression for the viable concentration as a function of time:\n$$\nC(t) = C_{0} \\exp(-\\delta t)\n$$\nThis is the general expression for first-order decay.\n\n**Calculation of the Half-Life $t_{1/2}$**\n\nThe half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time required for the concentration to decrease to half of its initial value. Mathematically, this is the time $t$ at which $C(t) = C_{0}/2$.\nWe substitute this condition into our derived expression for $C(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{C_{0}}{2} = C_{0} \\exp(-\\delta t_{1/2})\n$$\nWe can cancel $C_{0}$ from both sides (assuming $C_{0}  0$, which is physically necessary for the problem to be meaningful):\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-\\delta t_{1/2})\n$$\nTo solve for $t_{1/2}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\exp(-\\delta t_{1/2})\\right)\n$$\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -\\delta t_{1/2}\n$$\nDividing by $-\\delta$ gives the analytical expression for the half-life:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\delta}\n$$\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nThe problem provides the value of the inactivation parameter $\\delta = 0.35\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$. We substitute this value into the expression for $t_{1/2}$:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.35\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.69314718$, we compute the half-life:\n$$\nt_{1/2} \\approx \\frac{0.69314718}{0.35}\\,\\mathrm{days} \\approx 1.9804205\\,\\mathrm{days}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$\nt_{1/2} \\approx 1.980\\,\\mathrm{days}\n$$\nThe unit is days, as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.980}\n$$", "id": "4669321"}, {"introduction": "Once a potential host is exposed, the next critical question is whether that exposure leads to an infection. This exercise explores the crucial link between the dose of a pathogen and the probability of infection, a cornerstone of quantitative microbial risk assessment. By applying the exponential dose-response model, you will discover how a high-intensity exposure can overcome species barriers, providing a mathematical basis for understanding how rare spillover events occur [@problem_id:4669330].", "problem": "A research team is assessing the risk of a spillover event for a paramyxovirus carried by fruit bats to human orchard workers during an aerosol exposure incident. The number of viable virions inhaled by a worker is estimated as a dose of $D=5\\times 10^{5}$ particles, quantified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) after viability correction. Under the single-hit framework of the exponential dose-response model in microbial risk assessment, assume the following foundational bases: independent action of individual virions upon entry into a susceptible host, identical per-virion probability of initiating infection, and random arrival and success events that can be modeled using the properties of the Poisson distribution. Let the per-virion probability of successfully initiating infection be $k=2\\times 10^{-6}$. \n\nFrom these bases, derive the infection probability as a function of $k$ and $D$ under the exponential model, and compute the infection probability for the given $k$ and $D$. Express the infection probability as a decimal number (no percent sign), rounded to three significant figures. Briefly explain what this result implies for cross-species spillover risk when exposures are in the high-dose regime.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and calculation of an infection probability based on the exponential dose-response model, and an interpretation of the result in the context of high-dose exposure. The validation of the problem statement has confirmed its scientific soundness, consistency, and well-posed nature.\n\nFirst, we derive the probability of infection, $P_{inf}$, as a function of the dose, $D$, and the per-virion probability of initiating infection, $k$. The problem states that the process can be modeled using the properties of the Poisson distribution, consistent with the single-hit framework.\n\nLet $X$ be the random variable representing the number of individual virions that successfully initiate an infection within the host after a total dose of $D$ virions are inhaled. The assumptions of independent action and a constant, small per-virion success probability $k$ for a large number of virions $D$ lead to the modeling of $X$ as a Poisson-distributed random variable. The mean of this distribution, $\\lambda$, is the expected number of successful virions. This mean is given by the product of the total number of virions and the per-virion success probability:\n$$ \\lambda = Dk $$\nThe probability mass function for a Poisson distribution is given by:\n$$ P(X=x) = \\frac{\\lambda^x e^{-\\lambda}}{x!} $$\nwhere $x$ is a non-negative integer representing the number of successful events.\n\nAccording to the single-hit hypothesis, an infection occurs if at least one virion successfully establishes itself. This corresponds to the event $X \\geq 1$. The probability of infection, $P_{inf}$, is therefore the probability that $X$ is greater than or equal to $1$. It is more direct to calculate this by finding the probability of the complementary event, which is that no virions successfully cause infection ($X=0$), and subtracting this from $1$.\n$$ P_{inf} = P(X \\geq 1) = 1 - P(X=0) $$\nUsing the Poisson probability mass function for $x=0$:\n$$ P(X=0) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 e^{-\\lambda}}{0!} $$\nSince $\\lambda^0 = 1$ and $0! = 1$, this simplifies to:\n$$ P(X=0) = e^{-\\lambda} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\lambda$:\n$$ P(X=0) = \\exp(-Dk) $$\nTherefore, the probability of infection as a function of $D$ and $k$ is:\n$$ P_{inf}(D, k) = 1 - \\exp(-Dk) $$\nThis is the equation for the exponential dose-response model.\n\nNext, we compute the infection probability for the given values. The problem provides:\n- Dose, $D = 5 \\times 10^{5}$ particles\n- Per-virion probability of infection, $k = 2 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\nWe first calculate the mean number of successful infectious events, $\\lambda = Dk$:\n$$ Dk = (5 \\times 10^{5}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-6}) = 10 \\times 10^{5-6} = 10 \\times 10^{-1} = 1 $$\nThe mean number of virions expected to initiate an infection is $1$.\n\nNow, we substitute this value into the derived probability formula:\n$$ P_{inf} = 1 - \\exp(-1) $$\nUsing the value of Euler's number, $e \\approx 2.71828...$, we find $\\exp(-1) = \\frac{1}{e} \\approx 0.367879...$.\n$$ P_{inf} \\approx 1 - 0.367879... = 0.632120... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ P_{inf} \\approx 0.632 $$\n\nFinally, we explain what this result implies for cross-species spillover risk in a high-dose regime. The dose-response relationship $P_{inf} = 1 - \\exp(-Dk)$ is non-linear. The argument of the exponential, $Dk$, is the critical parameter. For spillover events, the per-virion probability of infection, $k$, is often very low due to host-species barriers (e.g., lack of receptor affinity, inefficient viral replication). At low doses, the infection probability is approximately linear with dose: $P_{inf} \\approx Dk$ for small $Dk$. However, in a high-dose regime, the total dose $D$ can be sufficiently large to make the product $Dk$ non-negligible or even large. As the dose $D$ increases, the term $\\exp(-Dk)$ approaches $0$, causing $P_{inf}$ to approach $1$. This indicates that even if a pathogen has a very low intrinsic ability to infect a new host species (a small $k$), a high-intensity exposure event can overcome this barrier and result in a high probability of infection. The calculated probability of approximately $63.2\\%$ for a mean of one successful hit exemplifies this: a significant risk of infection can arise from high-dose exposures, making such events critical drivers of zoonotic spillover.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.632}$$", "id": "4669330"}, {"introduction": "A single spillover infection is a tragedy, but the ability of a pathogen to spread from human to human determines if it becomes a public health crisis.
