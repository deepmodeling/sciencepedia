The problem states that this is the product of three factors. Let's derive this from first principles as requested.\n\nLet $R_{H,eff} = R_{HH}(1-e_H x)$ be the effective reproduction number within the human population and $R_{L,eff} = R_{LL}(1-e_L y)$ be the effective reproduction number within the livestock population. Let $R_{LH,eff} = R_{LH}(1-e_H x)$ be the effective number of spillover infections from a single livestock case to the human population. The problem assumes $R_{H,eff} < 1$ and $R_{L,eff} < 1$, which ensures that chains of transmission eventually die out.\n\nThe total number of cases in a simple branching process with reproduction number $R < 1$ is a geometric series $1 + R + R^2 + \\dots = \\frac{1}{1-R}$.\nLet $E_H$ be the expected total number of human cases initiated by a single infectious livestock case. This initial case produces, on average, $R_{L,eff}$ secondary livestock cases and $R_{LH,eff}$ secondary human cases.\nEach secondary human case initiates a human-only transmission chain of expected size $\\frac{1}{1-R_{H,eff}}$.\nEach secondary livestock case will, in turn, initiate its own full outbreak, generating an expected $E_H$ human cases.\nThis gives the self-consistent equation:\n$$E_H = R_{LH,eff} \\left(\\frac{1}{1-R_{H,eff}}\\right) + R_{L,eff} E_H$$\nSolving for $E_H$:\n$$E_H(1 - R_{L,eff}) = \\frac{R_{LH,eff}}{1-R_{H,eff}}$$\n$$E_H = Z(x,y) = \\frac{R_{LH,eff}}{(1-R_{L,eff})(1-R_{H,eff})}$$\nSubstituting the definitions of the effective reproduction numbers:\n$$Z(x,y) = \\frac{R_{LH}(1 - e_H x)}{\\left(1 - R_{LL}(1 - e_L y)\\right)\\left(1 - R_{HH}(1 - e_H x)\\right)}$$\nThe optimization goal is to minimize $Z(x,y)$ subject to the budget constraint $c_H N_H x + c_L N_L y = B$. The optimal allocation $(x^*, y^*)$ will not depend on the constant factor $R_{LH}$, so we can minimize the function $f(x,y) = Z(x,y)/R_{LH}$.\n$$f(x,y) = \\frac{1 - e_H x}{\\left(1 - R_{LL}(1 - e_L y)\\right)\\left(1 - R_{HH}(1 - e_H x)\\right)}$$\n\n### Step 2: Change of Variables\n\nTo simplify the problem, we introduce new variables representing the remaining population susceptibility, which are linear in $x$ and $y$:\n$S_H = 1 - e_H x$\n$S_L = 1 - e_L y$\nFrom these definitions, we have $x = (1-S_H)/e_H$ and $y = (1-S_L)/e_L$.

We can multiply by $S_H^2$:\n$$a_H(1 - R_{LL}S_L) = a_L R_{LL} S_H (1 - R_{HH}S_H)$$\nThis is the optimality condition. Now we use the budget constraint to solve for $S_H$ and $S_L$. From the constraint, we have $\\frac{S_L}{a_L} = C - \\frac{S_H}{a_H}$, which gives $S_L = a_L(C - \\frac{S_H}{a_H}) = a_L C - \\frac{a_L}{a_H}S_H$. Substituting this into the optimality condition:\n$$a_H\\left(1 - R_{LL}\\left(a_L C - \\frac{a_L}{a_H}S_H\\right)\\right) = a_L R_{LL} S_H - a_L R_{LL}R_{HH}S_H^2$$\n$$a_H - a_H R_{LL}a_L C + a_H R_{LL}\\frac{a_L}{a_H}S_H = a_L R_{LL} S_H - a_L R_{LL}R_{HH}S_H^2$$\n$$a_H - a_H R_{LL}a_L C + a_L R_{LL}S_H = a_L R_{LL} S_H - a_L R_{LL}R_{HH}S_H^2$$\nThe term $a_L R_{LL}S_H$ cancels on both sides:\n$$a_H - a_H R_{LL}a_L C = -a_L R_{LL}R_{HH}S_H^2$$\nSolving for $S_H^2$:\n$$S_H^2 = \\frac{a_H - a_H R_{LL}a_L C}{-a_L R_{LL}R_{HH}} = \\frac{a_H(R_{LL}a_L C - 1)}{a_L R_{LL}R_{HH}}$$\nSubstitute $C = \\frac{1}{a_H} + \\frac{1}{a_L} - B$:\n$$S_H^2 = \\frac{a_H}{a_L R_{LL}R_{HH}} \\left( R_{LL}a_L \\left(\\frac{1}{a_H} + \\frac{1}{a_L} - B\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\n$$S_H^2 = \\frac{a_H}{a_L R_{LL}R_{HH}} \\left( \\frac{R_{LL}a_L}{a_H} + R_{LL} - R_{LL}a_L B - 1 \\right)$$\n$$S_H^2 = \\frac{1}{R_{HH}} + \\frac{a_H(R_{LL}-1)}{a_L R_{LL}R_{HH}} - \\frac{a_H B}{R_{HH}}$$\n$$S_H^2 = \\frac{1}{R_{HH}}\\left(1 - a_H B + \\frac{a_H(R_{LL}-1)}{a_L R_{LL}}\\right)$$\nSince $S_H = 1-e_H x \\in [1-e_H, 1]$, $S_H$ must be positive. We take the positive square root for the optimal value $S_H^*$:\n$$S_H^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{R_{HH}}\\left(1 - a_H B + \\frac{a_H(R_{LL}-1)}{a_L R_{LL}}\\right)}$$\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Expression\n\nThe question asks for the fraction of the budget allocated to humans, $\\varphi^* = \\frac{c_H N_H x^*}{B}$.\nWe relate $x^*$ to $S_H^*$:\n$$S_H^* = 1 - e_H x^* \\implies x^* = \\frac{1-S_H^*}{e_H}$$\nSubstitute this into the expression for $\\varphi^*$:\n$$\\varphi^* = \\frac{c_H N_H}{B} \\left(\\frac{1-S_H^*}{e_H}\\right) = \\frac{c_H N_H}{B} \\frac{1-S_H^*}{a_H c_H N_H} = \\frac{1-S_H^*}{a_H B}$$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $S_H^*$:\n$$\\varphi^* = \\frac{1}{a_H B} \\left( 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{R_{HH}}\\left(1 - a_H B + \\frac{a_H(R_{LL}-1)}{a_L R_{LL}}\\right)} \\right)$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the optimal fraction of the budget spent on human vaccination.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{a_H B} \\left( 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{R_{HH}}\\left(1 - a_H B + \\frac{a_H(R_{LL}-1)}{a_L R_{LL}}\\right)} \\right)}$$", "id": "4681264"}]}
