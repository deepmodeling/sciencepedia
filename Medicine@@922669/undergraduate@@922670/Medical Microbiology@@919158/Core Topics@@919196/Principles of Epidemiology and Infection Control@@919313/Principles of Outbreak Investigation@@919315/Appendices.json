Consider a baseline period during which the system is stable: weekly counts are independent and arise from a stationary process with constant mean and variance.

A recent three-week period shows observed weekly counts of $20$, $28$, and $31$ cases, respectively. Assume there is no seasonality or reporting drift during these weeks and that counts are approximately normally distributed about the baseline mean with variance equal to the historical variance.\n\nUsing the principle of statistical process control applied in outbreak investigation, adopt a one-sided Shewhart-type decision rule that classifies a week as a signal when its observed count exceeds an upper control threshold defined by the baseline mean plus three times the baseline standard deviation. Classify the three-week period as an outbreak if at least one weekly signal occurs within the three-week window.\n\nCompute and apply this decision rule to the data above.

The decision will be represented by a numerical indicator.\n\nFirst, we establish the parameters of the statistical process control model from the problem statement. The baseline process is characterized by a mean weekly count $\\mu$ and a variance $\\sigma^2$.\nThe given values are:\n-   Mean: $\\mu = 12$\n-   Variance: $\\sigma^2 = 25$\n\nFrom the variance, we can compute the standard deviation, $\\sigma$, which is the square root of the variance.\n$$\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2} = \\sqrt{25} = 5\n$$\n\nThe problem defines a one-sided Shewhart-type decision rule. A week is classified as a \"signal\" if its observed count exceeds an upper control threshold, also known as the Upper Control Limit (UCL). This threshold is defined as the baseline mean plus three times the baseline standard deviation.\n$$\n\\text{UCL} = \\mu + 3\\sigma\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given values for $\\mu$ and the calculated value for $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\text{UCL} = 12 + 3(5) = 12 + 15 = 27\n$$\nTherefore, any weekly count greater than $27$ constitutes a signal for a potential aberration.\n\nNext, we examine the observed data for the recent three-week period.

Since $20 \\le 27$, this observation does not exceed the UCL. No signal is generated for this week.\n-   For week $2$: $X_2 = 28$. Since $28 > 27$, this observation exceeds the UCL. A signal is generated for this week.\n-   For week $3$: $X_3 = 31$. Since $31 > 27$, this observation exceeds the UCL. A signal is generated for this week.\n\nThe problem states that the entire three-week period is classified as an outbreak if at least one weekly signal occurs within the three-week window. In our analysis, we found signals in week $2$ and week $3$. Since the condition of \"at least one\" signal is met, the three-week period is classified as an outbreak.\n\nFinally, the problem requires expressing this decision numerically, where $1$ signifies an outbreak and $0$ signifies no outbreak.
