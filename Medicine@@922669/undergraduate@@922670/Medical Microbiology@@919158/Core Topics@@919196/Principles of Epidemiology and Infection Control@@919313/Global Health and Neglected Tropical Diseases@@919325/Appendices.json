Assume a homogeneous cohort in which each incident case experiences a constant disability weight throughout the illness and the same average duration, and each death occurs at an age where the remaining standard life expectancy is the same for all decedents.

It is a direct application of standard epidemiological principles from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) framework. The provided simplifying assumptions of a homogeneous cohort are standard for such introductory calculations and do not invalidate the problem.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the total burden of disease as measured by Disability-Adjusted Life Years ($DALY$). The $DALY$ is defined as the sum of Years Lived with Disability ($YLD$) and Years of Life Lost ($YLL$) due to premature mortality.\n$$DALY = YLD + YLL$$\nWe will derive and compute the value for each component based on the provided data for a cohort of new cases arising in a single year.\n\nFirst, we consider the Years Lived with Disability ($YLD$). This metric quantifies the morbidity, or the burden of living in states of less than full health. For a cohort of incident cases, the total $YLD$ is calculated by multiplying the number of new cases (Incidence, $I$) by the severity of the disease (Disability Weight, $w$) and the average duration of the disease ($D$). The problem states we can assume a constant disability weight throughout the illness for a homogeneous cohort.\n\nThe expression for $YLD$ is:\n$$YLD = I \\times w \\times D$$\nThe provided values are:\n- Incidence $I = 5{,}000$ cases\n- Disability weight $w = 0.2$ (a dimensionless value between $0$ for perfect health and $1$ for death)\n- Average duration $D = 2$ years\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression yields:\n$$YLD = 5{,}000 \\times 0.2 \\times 2$$\n$$YLD = 1{,}000 \\times 2$$\n$$YLD = 2{,}000 \\text{ years}$$\n\nNext, we consider the Years of Life Lost ($YLL$). This metric quantifies the mortality burden by measuring the years of life lost due to premature death. It is calculated by multiplying the number of deaths ($M$) by the standard life expectancy at the age of death ($L$). This value $L$ represents the number of years a person would have been expected to live had they not died prematurely from the disease.\n\nThe expression for $YLL$ is:\n$$YLL = M \\times L$$\nThe provided values are:\n- Mortality $M = 100$ deaths\n- Standard life expectancy at age of death $L = 30$ years\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression yields:\n$$YLL = 100 \\times 30$$\n$$YLL = 3{,}000 \\text{ years}$$\n\nFinally, the total Disability-Adjusted Life Years ($DALY$) is computed by summing the $YLD$ and $YLL$ components.\n$$DALY = YLD + YLL$$\n$$DALY = 2{,}000 + 3{,}000$$\n$$DALY = 5{,}000 \\text{ years}$$\n\nThe numerical values for the requested triple $(YLD, YLL, DALY)$ are therefore $(2000, 3000, 5000)$, with all units in years.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2000  3000  5000\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4633917"}, {"introduction": "Once a disease is prioritized, the next step is to design an effective control strategy. For many NTDs, Mass Drug Administration (MDA) is a key intervention whose success hinges on interrupting disease transmission. This practice explores the crucial relationship between a disease's infectiousness, measured by the basic reproduction number ($R_0$), and the minimum treatment coverage ($c$) required to halt its spread by driving the effective reproduction number ($R_e$) below the critical threshold of 1 [@problem_id:4633902].", "problem": "A public health team is planning annual mass drug administration (MDA) for a soil-transmitted helminth in a region where the basic reproduction number $R_0$ has been estimated as $R_0 = 2.5$. The oral anthelmintic has per-individual cure efficacy $e = 0.9$, meaning that for a treated individual, infection is cleared with probability $e$ and the individual contributes no transmission for the subsequent transmission season. Assume homogeneous random mixing, a closed population over the transmission season, and that treatment is delivered instantaneously at the start of the season to a fraction $c$ of the population selected at random and independent of infection status or exposure risk. Define the effective reproduction number $R_e$ as the expected number of secondary infections per primary infection in the current, partially protected population.\n\nUsing only the definition of the basic reproduction number $R_0$ as the expected number of secondary cases generated by a typical infectious individual in a fully susceptible and intervention-free population, and the notion that interventions reduce the per-capita transmission potential multiplicatively by the remaining fraction of transmission-capable contacts or hosts, derive the inequality that $c$ must satisfy so that $R_e  1$ during the season. Then, compute the minimal coverage $c$ that satisfies this inequality for $R_0 = 2.5$ and $e = 0.9$.\n\nRound your final numeric answer to three significant figures and express it as a unitless decimal fraction (do not use a percentage sign). In your reasoning, explicitly state the modeling assumptions that justify your derivation of the control threshold.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of an inequality for the minimal required coverage, $c$, of a mass drug administration (MDA) campaign to bring the effective reproduction number, $R_e$, below $1$, and to compute this value for the given parameters. The derivation hinges on relating $R_e$ to the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, by modeling the impact of the intervention.\n\nThe fundamental principle connecting $R_e$ to $R_0$ in a population with partial immunity or protection is given by $R_e = R_0 \\cdot s$, where $s$ is the fraction of the population that remains susceptible to infection. This relationship is a direct consequence of the mass-action principle under the assumption of homogeneous random mixing, which is explicitly stated in the problem. The number of new infections generated by a single infectious individual is proportional to the density of susceptible individuals they can successfully infect.\n\nThe intervention consists of treating a fraction $c$ of the population, chosen at random, with an anthelmintic drug of efficacy $e=0.9$. The problem states that for a treated individual, the infection is cleared with probability $e$ and the individual \"contributes no transmission for the subsequent transmission season.\" This implies that the intervention effectively removes a fraction of the population from the transmission cycle, rendering them equivalent to immune or non-susceptible individuals for the duration of the season.\n\nLet's precisely quantify the fraction of the population that remains susceptible or capable of participating in transmission after the MDA campaign.\nA fraction $c$ of the population receives treatment.\nOf this treated fraction $c$, a proportion $e$ are successfully \"cured\" or \"protected\" in the sense that they will not contribute to transmission. Thus, the fraction of the total population that is successfully protected by the intervention is the product of the coverage and the efficacy, which is $c \\cdot e$.\nThe remaining fraction of the population, which is still capable of participating in the transmission cycle (i.e., the effective susceptible fraction, $s$), is therefore $1 - c \\cdot e$.\n\nThe modeling assumptions that justify this derivation are:\n1.  **Homogeneous Random Mixing**: Every individual has an equal probability of contacting any other individual, so the reduction in transmission is directly proportional to the reduction in the susceptible/available population fraction.\n2.  **Random and Independent Treatment**: The fraction $c$ of the population is treated at random, irrespective of their infection or risk status. This allows us to calculate the protected fraction of the total population as a simple product.\n3.  **Leaky Protection Model**: The intervention is modeled as providing \"all-or-nothing\" protection to a fraction $e$ of the treated group $c$. This means a fraction $c \\cdot e$ of the total population becomes fully protected, while the rest remain fully susceptible. The problem's phrasing supports this interpretation.\n\nUsing this result, we can express the effective reproduction number $R_e$ as:\n$$R_e = R_0 (1 - c \\cdot e)$$\n\nThe goal of the public health program is to halt transmission, which is mathematically represented by the condition $R_e  1$. We can now establish the inequality that the coverage $c$ must satisfy:\n$$R_0 (1 - c \\cdot e)  1$$\n\nThis is the general inequality relating $c$ to $R_0$ and $e$. To find the minimal coverage required, we solve this inequality for $c$.\n$$1 - c \\cdot e  \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\n$$1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}  c \\cdot e$$\n$$c \\cdot e  1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\n$$c  \\frac{1}{e} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0} \\right)$$\n\nThis inequality defines the condition on the coverage $c$. Any coverage greater than the right-hand side will result in $R_e  1$. The minimal coverage, which we can denote $c_{min}$, is the value at the threshold of this inequality:\n$$c_{min} = \\frac{1}{e} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0} \\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression.

The required dose in mg is $40w$. The number of tablets, if fractional tablets were possible, would be $\\frac{40w}{600} = \\frac{w}{15}$. According to the dispensing rule, we must round this quantity up to the next integer. This corresponds to the ceiling function. The number of tablets for an individual of weight $w$, let's call it $T(w)$, is:\n$$ T(w) = \\left\\lceil \\frac{w}{15} \\right\\rceil $$\nSince the weight $W$ of a randomly chosen individual is a random variable, the number of tablets they receive, $T = T(W)$, is also a random variable. Our goal is to find the expected value of $T$, denoted $E[T]$. The total expected number of tablets for the campaign will then be $N \\times E[T]$.\n\nTo find $E[T]$ from first principles, we use the definition of expectation for a function of a continuous random variable:\n$$ E[T] = E\\left[\\left\\lceil \\frac{W}{15} \\right\\rceil\\right] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left\\lceil \\frac{w}{15} \\right\\rceil f_W(w) \\, dw $$\nwhere $f_W(w)$ is the probability density function (PDF) of the normal distribution for weight $W$:\n$$ f_W(w) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(w-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) $$\nThe problem states that we can ignore the probability of negative weights. This means we can effectively set the lower limit of integration to $0$. The ceiling function $\\lceil \\frac{w}{15} \\rceil$ is a step function that takes an integer value $k$ for weights $w$ in the interval $(15(k-1), 15k]$. For $w \\in (0, 15]$, $T(w)=1$. For $w \\in (15, 30]$, $T(w)=2$, and so on. We can thus decompose the integral into a sum of integrals over these intervals:\n$$ E[T] = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\int_{15(k-1)}^{15k} k \\cdot f_W(w) \\, dw $$\nThe integral part $\\int_{a}^{b} f_W(w) \\, dw$ is the probability $P(a  W \\le b)$.
