Mastering this balance is the first step toward generating clear, interpretable results.", "problem": "A laboratory is performing a rapid wet-mount negative stain to visualize the polysaccharide capsule of Cryptococcus neoformans in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF). The preparation uses India ink, a suspension of carbon particles that is excluded by the capsule, creating a clear halo against a dark background. The goal is to choose an appropriate mixing ratio of CSF to India ink drop volumes on a clean glass slide so that, after gently applying a coverslip, the background is sufficiently opaque to delineate the capsule while avoiding mechanical compression of the capsule due to excessive viscosity or the need to press down the coverslip.\n\nUse the following fundamental bases:\n\n- Negative staining relies on exclusion of suspended particles from hydrated capsules; optical contrast arises from particle concentration in the surrounding medium. According to the Beer–Lambert law, background opacity (absorbance) is proportional to the concentration of scatterers/absorbers and the optical path length: $$A = \\epsilon \\, c \\, \\ell,$$ where $A$ is absorbance (a proxy for opacity), $\\epsilon$ is an effective extinction coefficient for the suspension, $c$ is the concentration of carbon particles, and $\\ell$ is the path length through the wet mount.\n- Mixing India ink (stock concentration $c_0$) with CSF dilutes the particle concentration according to $$c = c_0 \\cdot \\frac{V_{\\text{ink}}}{V_{\\text{ink}} + V_{\\text{CSF}}},$$ where $V_{\\text{ink}}$ and $V_{\\text{CSF}}$ are the respective drop volumes.\n- Viscosity of a particle-laden suspension increases with particle volume fraction; higher viscosity increases shear stress during coverslip placement, which can deform soft structures such as polysaccharide capsules. Qualitatively, reducing the particle fraction reduces viscosity and thus shear stress transmitted to the organisms.\n\nUnder typical microscopy conditions, the path length $\\ell$ for a small wet mount under a coverslip is constrained by capillary spacing and practical drop sizes. Your task is to reason which mixing ratio best balances background opacity (sufficient $A$) with minimizing viscosity-related shear and the temptation to apply pressure on the coverslip.\n\nWhich ratio of CSF to India ink drop volumes is optimal to achieve adequate background opacity without compressing the capsule under a coverslip?\n\nA. $1:1$ (CSF:India ink)\n\nB. $2:1$ (CSF:India ink)\n\nC. $1:2$ (CSF:India ink)\n\nD. $3:1$ (CSF:India ink)", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of optics (Beer–Lambert law), fluid mechanics (suspension viscosity), and microbiology (negative staining). The problem is well-posed, providing a clear objective—to find an optimal balance between two competing factors—and presents a set of discrete, evaluable options. The language is objective and the premises are realistic and internally consistent.\n\nThe core of the problem is to find an optimal mixing ratio of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) to India ink, represented by their respective volumes $V_{\\text{CSF}}$ and $V_{\\text{ink}}$. This optimization requires balancing two competing requirements:\n1.  **Sufficient Opacity**: The background must be dark enough to provide contrast for the unstained capsules. According to the Beer–Lambert law, absorbance ($A$), a measure of opacity, is proportional to the concentration of carbon particles ($c$): $$A \\propto c$$ To achieve high opacity, a high concentration $c$ is desirable.\n2.  **Minimal Capsule Compression**: The viscosity of the suspension should be low enough to prevent mechanical shear stress from deforming or compressing the delicate polysaccharide capsules when the coverslip is applied. The problem states that viscosity increases with particle concentration. Therefore, to minimize viscosity and shear, a low concentration $c$ is desirable.\n\nThe final concentration $c$ of carbon particles is determined by the dilution of the stock ink (concentration $c_0$) with CSF:\n$$c = c_0 \\cdot \\frac{V_{\\text{ink}}}{V_{\\text{ink}} + V_{\\text{CSF}}}$$\nThis equation quantitatively links the mixing ratio to the particle concentration $c$, which in turn governs the trade-off between opacity and viscosity. A high proportion of ink (large $\\frac{V_{\\text{ink}}}{V_{\\text{ink}} + V_{\\text{CSF}}}$) leads to high $c$, resulting in high opacity but also high viscosity. Conversely, a low proportion of ink (small $\\frac{V_{\\text{ink}}}{V_{\\text{ink}} + V_{\\text{CSF}}}$) leads to low $c$, resulting in low viscosity but also low opacity. The \"optimal\" ratio is the one that best balances these effects, providing adequate opacity without causing significant viscous artifacts.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option by calculating the particle concentration relative to the stock concentration, $c/c_0$, which is equal to the dilution factor $\\frac{V_{\\text{ink}}}{V_{\\text{ink}} + V_{\\text{CSF}}}$. The ratios are given as CSF:India ink ($V_{\\text{CSF}}:V_{\\text{ink}}$).\n\n**A. $1:1$ (CSF:India ink)**\n- The ratio is $V_{\\text{CSF}}:V_{\\text{ink}} = 1:1$. Let $V_{\\text{CSF}} = V$ and $V_{\\text{ink}} = V$.\n- The concentration factor is $\\frac{V}{V + V} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$.\n- The final concentration is $c = 0.5 \\cdot c_0$.\n- This ratio dilutes the ink by half, which significantly reduces the viscosity compared to the stock ink, thereby minimizing the risk of capsule compression. A $50\\%$ particle concentration is generally sufficient to produce a dark, opaque background for effective visualization. This represents a strong, balanced compromise between the two competing requirements.\n- **Verdict: Correct**. This option provides a standard and effective balance between opacity and low viscosity.\n\n**B. $2:1$ (CSF:India ink)**\n- The ratio is $V_{\\text{CSF}}:V_{\\text{ink}} = 2:1$. Let $V_{\\text{CSF}} = 2V$ and $V_{\\text{ink}} = V$.\n- The concentration factor is $\\frac{V}{V + 2V} = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.33$.\n- The final concentration is $c \\approx 0.33 \\cdot c_0$.\n- This greater dilution results in even lower viscosity, which is favorable for preserving the capsule structure. However, reducing the particle concentration to one-third of the original may render the background too pale (grayish rather than black), leading to insufficient contrast to clearly delineate the capsule halos. This option prioritizes low viscosity at the likely expense of adequate opacity.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**. The background opacity is likely to be insufficient.\n\n**C. $1:2$ (CSF:India ink)**\n- The ratio is $V_{\\text{CSF}}:V_{\\text{ink}} = 1:2$. Let $V_{\\text{CSF}} = V$ and $V_{\\text{ink}} = 2V$.\n- The concentration factor is $\\frac{2V}{V + 2V} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.67$.\n- The final concentration is $c \\approx 0.67 \\cdot c_0$.\n- This mixture contains a high concentration of ink particles, which will certainly produce a very dark, opaque background. However, the concentration is only moderately reduced from the stock ink, meaning the viscosity will remain relatively high. This high viscosity increases the shear stress during coverslip application, elevating the risk of mechanically compressing or distorting the yeast capsules, which the problem statement explicitly aims to avoid.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**. The risk of capsule compression due to high viscosity is too great.\n\n**D. $3:1$ (CSF:India ink)**\n- The ratio is $V_{\\text{CSF}}:V_{\\text{ink}} = 3:1$. Let $V_{\\text{CSF}} = 3V$ and $V_{\\text{ink}} = V$.\n- The concentration factor is $\\frac{V}{V + 3V} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$.\n- The final concentration is $c = 0.25 \\cdot c_0$.\n- This is the most dilute mixture among the options. It offers the lowest viscosity and therefore the minimum risk of mechanical damage to the capsules. However, with only $25\\%$ of the original particle concentration, the background would be very light, almost certainly providing inadequate contrast for reliable detection of the capsules. This is an extreme dilution that fails the opacity requirement.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**. The background would be too transparent for effective negative staining.\n\nIn summary, the $1:1$ ratio (Option A) provides the most effective balance. It sufficiently dilutes the ink to reduce viscosity and prevent artifacts, while maintaining enough particle concentration to ensure an adequately opaque background for contrast. The other options are suboptimal because they are too dilute (B and D, sacrificing opacity) or too concentrated (C, sacrificing safety from mechanical artifacts).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4639999"}, {"introduction": "Once your slide is prepared, the next critical skill is accurate identification.

The foundational physical and biological facts are as follows: India ink contains carbon particles that attenuate transmitted light, and a polysaccharide capsule surrounding an organism excludes these particles, producing a clear halo. In brightfield microscopy, contrast arises from differences in optical path and scattering.

The described phenomena are observable and verifiable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will now be derived.\n\n**Principle-Based Derivation of Distinguishing Criteria**\n\nThe core task is to differentiate a true cryptococcal capsule from three artefacts based on their optical properties as described by the provided physical principles.\n\n1.  **True Cryptococcal Capsule:**\n    - **Primary Contrast Mechanism:** The problem states the capsule *excludes* carbon particles. The surrounding ink suspension has a high concentration of these particles, leading to significant light attenuation (high $\\alpha$ in $I = I_0 e^{-\\alpha t}$). The capsule, being a hydrated polysaccharide gel, is mostly water and lacks these particles ($\\alpha \\approx 0$). Therefore, the primary source of contrast is the difference in light transmission: the capsule appears as a bright or clear halo against a dark, attenuated background. This is a negative staining effect based on absorption/attenuation, not primarily refraction.\n    - **Refractive Properties:** The refractive index of the capsule ($n_{\\text{capsule}} \\approx 1.35$) is very close to that of the surrounding aqueous medium ($n_{\\text{water}} \\approx 1.33$). The difference is $\\Delta n = n_{\\text{capsule}} - n_{\\text{water}} \\approx 0.02$. According to Snell's law, a small $\\Delta n$ at the interface results in minimal light bending (refraction). Consequently, the edge of the capsule will not be \"sharply bright\" or \"highly refractile\". It will be a \"low-contrast\" boundary defined by the edge of the particle exclusion zone.\n    - **Structural Properties:** The capsule is a biological component, physically attached to the yeast cell. It will conform to the cell's morphology, including the characteristic narrowing (isthmus) at the neck between a mother cell and its bud. Halos are associated with individual organisms.\n    - **Response to Focus Change ($\\Delta z$):** Because the contrast is mainly from attenuation and the refractive index mismatch is minimal, the halo's appearance should be relatively stable during small changes in focus ($\\Delta z \\approx \\pm 2\\ \\mu\\text{m}$). There will be no pronounced lens-like effects causing dramatic a change in brightness or apparent thickness. The halo remains attached to the cell.\n    - **Response to Stage Translation ($\\Delta x$):** Since the capsule is an integral part of the yeast cell, moving the stage by $\\Delta x$ will cause the cell and its attached capsule to move together as a single unit relative to the eyepiece reticle. The capsule's position relative to the cell is fixed.\n\n2.  **Artefact 1: Air Bubble:**\n    - **Optical Properties:** An air bubble presents an interface between air ($n_{\\text{air}} \\approx 1.00$) and water ($n_{\\text{water}} \\approx 1.33$). The refractive index difference is large: $\\Delta n = n_{\\text{water}} - n_{\\text{air}} \\approx 0.33$. The high curvature of the bubble combined with this large $\\Delta n$ will cause strong refraction and reflection, creating a \"sharply bright, highly refractile\" ring.\n    - **Response to Focus Change ($\\Delta z$):** The strong lensing effect of the curved air-water interface means that the appearance of the bright ring will change dramatically with focus. The apparent thickness and brightness of the edge are highly sensitive to the focal plane.\n    - **Structural Properties:** Bubbles are typically spherical and can be much larger than yeast cells, potentially \"spanning across many cells.\" They are not physically attached to any single cell.\n\n3.  **Artefact 2: Drying Ring:**\n    - **Physical Basis:** This is a macroscopic phenomenon related to the evaporation of the liquid drop (the coffee-ring effect). Particles and solutes are deposited at the receding edge of the drop.\n    - **Appearance:** This results in \"arcuate\" shapes, typically near the edge of the entire preparation, not centered on individual cells. The effect is characterized by an increased concentration of ink, so it would appear as a darker region, not a clear halo. Its behaviour is linked to hydration status, intensifying with drying and disappearing with rehydration.\n\n4.  **Artefact 3: Fat Droplet:**\n    - **Optical Properties:** A fat droplet creates an interface between fat ($n_{\\text{fat}} \\approx 1.47$) and water ($n_{\\text{water}} \\approx 1.33$). The refractive index difference, $\\Delta n = n_{\\text{fat}} - n_{\\text{water}} \\approx 0.14$, is significant (though less than for air). This will produce a \"brilliant\" or \"refractile\" halo. The droplet body will also exclude ink particles.\n    - **Structural Properties:** Fat droplets are typically spherical bodies and lack internal cellular structures like a cell wall or nucleus. They are \"isolated spherical bodies.\"\n    - **Mobility:** As independent particles suspended in the fluid, they are not attached to cells and can exhibit independent movement (e.g., Brownian motion or movement with fluid currents when the stage is moved).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nBased on the derived criteria, each option is evaluated.\n\n**A. A sharply bright, highly refractile circular ring that spans across many cells in the same field, whose apparent thickness increases when changing focus by $\\Delta z \\approx +2\\ \\mu\\text{m}$ and decreases with $\\Delta z \\approx -2\\ \\mu\\text{m}$; the ring shifts relative to nearby cells when the stage is translated by $\\Delta x \\approx 10\\ \\mu\\text{m}$.**\n- **Analysis:** \"Sharply bright, highly refractile\" points to a large $\\Delta n$, characteristic of an air bubble. \"Spans across many cells\" is inconsistent with a single organism's capsule. The strong dependence of appearance on focus (\"apparent thickness increases... decreases\") is a classic lens-like effect of a highly curved, high-$\\Delta n$ interface. The relative shift upon stage translation confirms it is not physically attached to the cells. These features perfectly describe an air bubble artefact.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. A low-contrast, smooth, particle-free halo that conforms tightly to the yeast wall including a narrowed isthmus at the bud neck; the halo remains spatially attached to the cell with unchanged relative position when focus is changed by $\\Delta z \\approx \\pm 2\\ \\mu\\text{m}$; Brownian motion of ink particles is visible immediately outside the halo boundary; halos are present around individual cells rather than forming field-wide arcs.**\n- **Analysis:** \"Low-contrast\" matches the small $\\Delta n$ between capsule ($1.35$) and water ($1.33$). \"Particle-free halo\" is the definition of the negative stain. \"Conforms tightly to the yeast wall including a narrowed isthmus\" correctly describes the biological nature of the capsule on a budding yeast. The stability of its relative position through focus change is consistent with a low-refractility object. The visibility of Brownian motion at the boundary confirms a physical exclusion barrier in a liquid medium. The presence around individual cells distinguishes it from large-scale artefacts. This option aligns perfectly with all derived criteria for a true capsule.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**C. Arcuate halos appearing predominantly near one edge of the droplet in the field, with a gradient of darkness increasing toward the periphery; halos intensify over time as the preparation dries and disappear after rehydrating the periphery.**\n- **Analysis:** The description of \"arcuate halos near one edge,\" a \"gradient of darkness,\" and the explicit dependence on drying and rehydration are the defining characteristics of a drying ring artefact (coffee-ring effect). This does not describe a structure associated with an individual microorganism.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Brilliant, circular halos encasing isolated spherical bodies lacking a visible cell wall, with rapid movement independent of adjacent cells; the halos exhibit strong edge brightness that persists even when focus is changed by $\\Delta z \\approx \\pm 2\\ \\mu\\text{m}$ and shift position when the stage is translated by $\\Delta x \\approx 10\\ \\mu\\text{m}$.**\n- **Analysis:** \"Brilliant, circular halos\" indicates significant refractility, consistent with the $\\Delta n \\approx 0.14$ of a fat droplet. \"Isolated spherical bodies lacking a visible cell wall\" is the morphological description of a fat droplet, not a yeast cell. \"Rapid movement independent of adjacent cells\" and shifting position upon translation confirm it is an unattached, mobile particle. These features describe a fat droplet artefact.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4639948"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple identification, quantitative measurement provides valuable data for clinical and research settings.

Calibration of the Ocular Micrometer (OM)**\n\nThe calibration relates the arbitrary divisions of the OM to a known physical length provided by the SM.\nThe total length spanned by $10$ SM divisions is:\n$$ L = 10 \\text{ SM divisions} \\times \\frac{10\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}}{1 \\text{ SM division}} = 100\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} $$\nThis length corresponds to $50$ OM divisions. Therefore, the calibration factor ($CF$) for one OM division is:\n$$ CF = \\frac{100\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}}{50 \\text{ OM divisions}} = 2\\ \\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{\\text{OM division}} $$\n\n**B. Calculation of Capsule Thickness per Cell**\n\nThe capsule thickness, $T$, is the difference between the outer radius ($R$) of the capsule and the inner radius ($r$) of the cell body. The measurements provided are diameters ($D$ for outer, $d$ for inner).\n$$ R = \\frac{D}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad r = \\frac{d}{2} $$\nThe thickness is therefore given by:\n$$ T = R - r = \\frac{D}{2} - \\frac{d}{2} = \\frac{D - d}{2} $$\nThis formula can be applied to the measurements in OM divisions, and the result is then converted to micrometers using the calibration factor.\n\nLet's calculate the thickness, $T_i$, for each cell $i$:\n-   **Cell 1:** $T_1 = \\frac{D_1 - d_1}{2} \\times CF = \\frac{22 - 16}{2} \\times 2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = \\frac{6}{2} \\times 2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 3 \\times 2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 6\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n-   **Cell 2:** $T_2 = \\frac{D_2 - d_2}{2} \\times CF = \\frac{19 - 14}{2} \\times 2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = \\frac{5}{2} \\times 2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 2.5 \\times 2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 5\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n-   **Cell 3:** $T_3 = \\frac{D_3 - d_3}{2} \\times CF = \\frac{24 - 17}{2} \\times 2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = \\frac{7}{2} \\times 2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 3.5 \\times 2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 7\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n-   **Cell 4:** $T_4 = \\frac{D_4 - d_4}{2} \\times CF = \\frac{21 - 15}{2} \\times 2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = \\frac{6}{2} \\times 2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 3 \\times 2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 6\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n-   **Cell 5:** $T_5 = \\frac{D_5 - d_5}{2} \\times CF = \\frac{20 - 16}{2} \\times 2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = \\frac{4}{2} \\times 2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 2 \\times 2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 4\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n\nThe set of per-cell thickness measurements is $\\{6, 5, 7, 6, 4\\}\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\n**C. Statistical Analysis**\n\nThe problem asks for \"appropriate statistical reporting\" for a sample of $n=5$ cells. This implies we are estimating the parameters of the larger population from which the sample was drawn.\n\n1.  **Sample Mean ($\\bar{T}$):**\n    $$ \\bar{T} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} T_i = \\frac{6 + 5 + 7 + 6 + 4}{5}\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = \\frac{28}{5}\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 5.6\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} $$\n\n2.  **Sample Variance:** For a scientifically rigorous estimation of the population variance from a sample, the **unbiased sample variance** ($s^2$) should be used. It employs Bessel's correction, dividing by $n-1$.\n    $$ s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (T_i - \\bar{T})^2 $$\n    The sum of squared differences from the mean is:\n    $$ \\sum (T_i - \\bar{T})^2 = (6-5.6)^2 + (5-5.6)^2 + (7-5.6)^2 + (6-5.6)^2 + (4-5.6)^2 $$\n    $$ \\sum (T_i - \\bar{T})^2 = (0.4)^2 + (-0.6)^2 + (1.4)^2 + (0.4)^2 + (-1.6)^2 $$\n    $$ \\sum (T_i - \\bar{T})^2 = 0.16 + 0.36 + 1.96 + 0.16 + 2.56 = 5.2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^2 $$\n    The unbiased sample variance is:\n    $$ s^2 = \\frac{5.2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^2}{5-1} = \\frac{5.2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^2}{4} = 1.3\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^2 $$\n\n### Step 3: Evaluation of Provided Options\n\n**A. Calibrate the Ocular Micrometer (OM) at the same magnification used for measuring the India ink preparation by equating $50$ OM divisions to $10$ Stage Micrometer (SM) divisions, so each OM division corresponds to $2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$. For each cell, compute capsule thickness as the difference in radii between the capsule’s outer boundary and the cell body, obtained by halving the diameters and converting OM divisions to micrometers; across the $n=5$ cells, report the sample mean capsule thickness and the unbiased sample variance. For the given dataset, the per-cell thicknesses are $[6,5,7,6,4]\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$, the mean is $5.6\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$, and the variance is $1.3\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$.**\n-   **Methodology:** The calibration ($2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$ per OM division), the formula for thickness (difference in radii, $T=(D-d)/2$), and the choice of statistics (sample mean and unbiased sample variance) are all correct and scientifically rigorous.\n-   **Numerical Results:** The per-cell thicknesses ($[6,5,7,6,4]\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$), the mean ($5.6\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$), and the unbiased sample variance ($1.3\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$) all match my derivation.\n-   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. Calibrate by equating $50$ OM divisions to $10$ SM divisions, so each OM division is $2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$, then compute capsule thickness for each cell as the difference of diameters without halving, multiplied by the calibration factor. For the dataset, the thicknesses are $[12,10,14,12,8]\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$, the mean is $11.2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$, and the variance is $5.2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$.**\n-   **Methodology:** The calibration is correct. However, computing thickness as the difference of diameters ($D-d$) is physically incorrect. This value represents twice the capsule thickness ($2T$).\n-   **Numerical Results:** The reported values are consistent with the flawed method but are factually incorrect representations of capsule thickness.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Calibrate using the SM but assume the SM divisions are $1\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$, giving $0.2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$ per OM division, and perform calibration at a different magnification than the India ink measurements. Compute thickness as the difference in radii and report the mean and variance. For the dataset, the per-cell thicknesses are $[0.6,0.5,0.7,0.6,0.4]\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$, the mean is $0.56\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$, and the variance is $0.013\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$.**\n-   **Methodology:** This option contains multiple procedural errors. The value for an SM division is incorrectly assumed ($1\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$ instead of the stated $10\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$). Calibrating at a different magnification from measurement is a critical error in microscopy that invalidates the calibration.\n-   **Numerical Results:** The values are consistent with the flawed calibration but are incorrect.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Calibrate correctly so each OM division is $2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$, compute thickness per cell as the difference in radii, and report the mean along with the population variance across the $n=5$ measurements by dividing by $n$. For the dataset, the per-cell thicknesses are $[6,5,7,6,4]\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$, the mean is $5.6\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$, and the variance is $1.04\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$.**\n-   **Methodology:** The calibration and thickness calculation are correct. However, it specifies reporting the *population* variance (or biased sample variance, calculated by dividing by $n=5$). For a small sample ($n=5$) from a larger population, the scientifically rigorous and appropriate statistic to report is the *unbiased sample variance* (dividing by $n-1=4$), as it provides a better estimate of the true population variance.\n-   **Numerical Results:** The variance is calculated as $\\frac{5.2}{5} = 1.04\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$. While the arithmetic is correct for the specified (but less appropriate) statistic, the choice of statistic itself is the flaw being tested.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4640003"}]}
