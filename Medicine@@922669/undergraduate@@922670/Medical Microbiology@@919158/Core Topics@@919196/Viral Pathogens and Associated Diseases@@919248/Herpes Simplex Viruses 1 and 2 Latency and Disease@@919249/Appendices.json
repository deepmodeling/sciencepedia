I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to calculate the percent reduction in daily shedding frequency. The daily shedding frequency ($f_s$) is the product of the reactivation rate ($\\lambda$) and the probability that a single reactivation leads to a detectable shedding event ($P(\\text{shedding})$).\n$$f_s = \\lambda \\cdot P(\\text{shedding})$$\nThe problem states that the drug does not affect the reactivation rate $\\lambda$. Therefore, the reduction in shedding frequency is driven entirely by the reduction in the probability of shedding per reactivation.\n\nLet $P_0$ be the probability of shedding without the drug, and $P_D$ be the probability with the drug.\nThe frequency without drug is $f_{s,0} = \\lambda P_0$.\nThe frequency with drug is $f_{s,D} = \\lambda P_D$.\nThe percent reduction is given by:\n$$ \\text{Percent Reduction} = \\frac{f_{s,0} - f_{s,D}}{f_{s,0}} \\times 100\\% = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\lambda P_D}{\\lambda P_0}\\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left(1 - \\frac{P_D}{P_0}\\right) \\times 100\\% $$\nOur task reduces to calculating $P_0$ and $P_D$.\n\n**Probability of a Shedding Event**\nA shedding event is detectable if the viral load $V(t) = V_0 e^{r_{\\text{eff}} t}$ reaches the threshold $V_{\\text{th}}$ before the immune system curtails the replication at time $\\tau$.\nFirst, we find the time required to reach the threshold, $t_{\\text{th}}$.\n$$ V_{\\text{th}} = V_0 e^{r_{\\text{eff}} t_{\\text{th}}} \\implies t_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{1}{r_{\\text{eff}}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\text{th}}}{V_0}\\right) $$\nFor shedding to occur, this time must be less than the random curtailment time $\\tau$, i.e., $t_{\\text{th}} < \\tau$. Since $\\tau$ is a random variable uniformly distributed on $[0, \\tau_{\\max}]$, its probability density function is $p(x) = 1/\\tau_{\\max}$ for $x \\in [0, \\tau_{\\max}]$.\nThe probability of shedding is $P(t_{\\text{th}} < \\tau)$. This is conditioned on $r_{\\text{eff}} > 0$, as viral load cannot grow otherwise.\nAssuming $0 < t_{\\text{th}} \\le \\tau_{\\max}$, the probability is:\n$$ P(\\text{shedding}) = P(\\tau > t_{\\text{th}}) = \\int_{t_{\\text{th}}}^{\\tau_{\\max}} \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\max}} dx = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\max}}[\\tau_{\\max} - t_{\\text{th}}] = 1 - \\frac{t_{\\text{th}}}{\\tau_{\\max}} $$\nIf $t_{\\text{th}} > \\tau_{\\max}$, the probability is $0$.\n\nLet's compute the constant term $\\ln(V_{\\text{th}}/V_0)$:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\text{th}}}{V_0}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{10^5}{10^3}\\right) = \\ln(100) \\approx 4.60517 $$\n\n**1. Baseline Case (No Drug)**\nWithout the drug, the concentration $C=0$, so the inhibition $E(0)=0$.\nThe effective growth rate is $r_{\\text{eff}} = r_0 (1-0) = r_0$.\n-   $r_0 = 2.0$ day$^{-1}$.\nThe time to threshold, $t_{\\text{th},0}$, is:\n$$ t_{\\text{th},0} = \\frac{\\ln(100)}{r_0} \\approx \\frac{4.60517}{2.0 \\text{ day}^{-1}} \\approx 2.3026 \\text{ days} $$\nSince $0 < t_{\\text{th},0} \\le \\tau_{\\max}$ (where $\\tau_{\\max}=10$ days), we can calculate the probability of shedding, $P_0$:\n$$ P_0 = 1 - \\frac{t_{\\text{th},0}}{\\tau_{\\max}} \\approx 1 - \\frac{2.3026}{10} = 0.76974 $$\n\n**2. With Valacyclovir (Drug)**\nFirst, we calculate the average steady-state plasma concentration, $C_{\\text{avg}}$.\nThe dosing rate is $\\frac{F \\cdot D}{\\tau_d}$:\n$$ \\text{Dosing Rate} = \\frac{0.55 \\times 1000 \\text{ mg}}{24 \\text{ h}} = \\frac{550}{24} \\text{ mg/h} \\approx 22.917 \\text{ mg/h} $$\nNow, we find $C_{\\text{avg}}$:\n$$ C_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{\\text{Dosing Rate}}{CL} \\approx \\frac{22.917 \\text{ mg/h}}{20 \\text{ L/h}} \\approx 1.1458 \\text{ mg/L} $$\nNext, we calculate the fractional inhibition $E(C_{\\text{avg}})$:\n$$ E(C_{\\text{avg}}) = E_{\\max}\\,\\frac{C_{\\text{avg}}}{EC_{50} + C_{\\text{avg}}} \\approx 0.90 \\times \\frac{1.1458}{0.50 + 1.1458} \\approx 0.90 \\times \\frac{1.1458}{1.6458} \\approx 0.90 \\times 0.6962 \\approx 0.6266 $$\nNow, we find the drug-suppressed effective growth rate, $r_D$:\n$$ r_D = r_0 (1 - E(C_{\\text{avg}})) \\approx 2.0 \\text{ day}^{-1} \\times (1 - 0.6266) = 2.0 \\times 0.3734 = 0.7468 \\text{ day}^{-1} $$\nThe time to threshold with the drug, $t_{\\text{th},D}$, is:\n$$ t_{\\text{th},D} = \\frac{\\ln(100)}{r_D} \\approx \\frac{4.60517}{0.7468 \\text{ day}^{-1}} \\approx 6.166 \\text{ days} $$\nSince $0 < t_{\\text{th},D} \\le \\tau_{\\max}$, we can calculate the probability of shedding, $P_D$:\n$$ P_D = 1 - \\frac{t_{\\text{th},D}}{\\tau_{\\max}} \\approx 1 - \\frac{6.166}{10} = 0.3834 $$\n\n**3. Percent Reduction Calculation**\nFinally, we compute the percent reduction in shedding frequency:\n$$ \\text{Percent Reduction} = \\left(1 - \\frac{P_D}{P_0}\\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx \\left(1 - \\frac{0.3834}{0.76974}\\right) \\times 100\\% $$\n$$ \\text{Percent Reduction} \\approx (1 - 0.4981) \\times 100\\% = 0.5019 \\times 100\\% \\approx 50.2\\% $$\nThe predicted percent reduction in shedding frequency is approximately $50.2\\%$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nBased on the derived value of approximately $50.2\\%$ reduction:\n\n-   **A. Approximately $20\\%$ reduction**: Incorrect. This value is significantly lower than the calculated $50.2\\%$.\n-   **B. Approximately $35\\%$ reduction**: Incorrect.
