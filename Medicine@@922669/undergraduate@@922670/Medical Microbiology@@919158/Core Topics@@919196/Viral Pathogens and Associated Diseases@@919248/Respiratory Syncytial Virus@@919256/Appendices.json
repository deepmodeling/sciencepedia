The first step is to perform a rigorous validation of the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Patient**: A $3$-month-old infant with laboratory-confirmed respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis.\n- **Pathophysiology**: In distal, noncartilaginous bronchioles, mucosal edema and intraluminal debris reduce the effective luminal radius by approximately one-half during inspiration.\n- **Model Assumptions**:\n    1. Airflow is steady, laminar, and fully developed.\n    2. Air behaves as a Newtonian fluid at body temperature.\n    3. Bronchiolar segments are approximated as rigid cylindrical tubes of fixed length during a given inspiratory phase.\n    4. Gas viscosity and segment length remain unchanged between baseline and disease states.\n- **Definition**: Airway resistance is defined as $R \\equiv \\Delta P/Q$, where $\\Delta P$ is the pressure drop along a representative bronchiolar segment and $Q$ is the volumetric flow.\n- **Underlying Principle**: The solution should use the \"well-tested relation for viscous laminar flow in cylindrical conduits.\"\n- **Problem Condition**: The task is to determine the factor by which the driving pressure drop $\\Delta P$ must increase to maintain the same volumetric flow $Q$.\n- **Change in Radius**: The radius is reduced from a baseline value of $r$ to a disease-state value of $r/2$.\n- **Final Quantity**: A dimensionless “severity index” $S$ is defined as $S \\equiv \\Delta P_{\\text{disease}}/\\Delta P_{\\text{baseline}}$. The value of $S$ must be computed.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is well-grounded in both pediatric medicine and fluid mechanics. Bronchiolitis is a common pediatric illness characterized by inflammation and obstruction of small airways (bronchioles). The reduction of the luminal radius due to edema and debris is a key feature of its pathophysiology. The application of fluid dynamics principles to model airflow in the respiratory tract is a standard and valid approach in biomedical engineering and physiology. The Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which describes laminar flow in a pipe, is the appropriate model given the stated assumptions (laminar flow, cylindrical tube). These assumptions are reasonable idealizations for this level of analysis.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear definition for resistance ($R$), specifies the relationship between pressure drop ($\\Delta P$), flow ($Q$), and radius ($r$), and sets a clear objective: to find the ratio of pressure drops required to maintain constant flow. All necessary information is provided.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise, technical, and free of subjectivity. Terms are defined clearly.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. It states which variables change (radius) and which remain constant (viscosity, length, flow rate), avoiding ambiguity. There are no contradictions.\n- **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: While the reduction of the radius by exactly one-half is an idealization, it is not physically implausible in the context of severe bronchiolitis. The other assumptions are standard for a first-order model.\n- **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured**: The problem is clearly structured and leads to a unique, stable solution.\n- **Other Flaws**: The problem is a non-trivial application of a core physics principle to a real-world medical scenario, not pseudo-profound or tautological.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid, scientifically sound, and well-posed. Proceeding to the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to analyze the change in pressure drop ($\\Delta P$) needed to maintain a constant volumetric flow rate ($Q$) when the radius of a bronchiole is reduced. The flow is described as steady, laminar, and fully developed in a rigid cylindrical tube, with the fluid (air) being Newtonian. These are the precise conditions under which the Hagen-Poiseuille equation applies.\n\nThe Hagen-Poiseuille equation relates the volumetric flow rate $Q$ to the pressure drop $\\Delta P$ over a cylindrical tube of length $L$ and radius $r$, for a fluid with dynamic viscosity $\\eta$:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\nThe problem defines airway resistance $R$ as:\n$$R = \\frac{\\Delta P}{Q}$$\nBy rearranging the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, we can express the resistance $R$ in terms of the geometric and fluid properties:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta P}{Q} = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4}$$\nThus, the resistance is:\n$$R = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4}$$\nThis equation shows that the resistance is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius, $R \\propto r^{-4}$.\n\nWe are asked to compare two states: a healthy \"baseline\" state and a \"disease\" state.\nLet the subscript 'baseline' denote the healthy state and 'disease' denote the state with bronchiolitis.\n\nIn the baseline state, the radius is $r_{\\text{baseline}} = r$, and the resistance is:\n$$R_{\\text{baseline}} = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r_{\\text{baseline}}^4} = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4}$$\nThe corresponding pressure drop is $\\Delta P_{\\text{baseline}} = Q_{\\text{baseline}} R_{\\text{baseline}}$.\n\nIn the disease state, the problem states that the effective luminal radius is reduced by one-half. So, the new radius is $r_{\\text{disease}} = r/2$. The problem also states that the fluid viscosity $\\eta$ and segment length $L$ remain unchanged. The resistance in the disease state is:\n$$R_{\\text{disease}} = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r_{\\text{disease}}^4} = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi (r/2)^4}$$\nSimplifying the expression for $R_{\\text{disease}}$:\n$$R_{\\text{disease}} = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi (r^4/16)} = 16 \\left( \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4} \\right)$$\nComparing this to the baseline resistance, we find:\n$$R_{\\text{disease}} = 16 R_{\\text{baseline}}$$\nThis shows that halving the radius increases the airway resistance by a factor of $16$.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the factor by which the driving pressure drop $\\Delta P$ must increase to maintain the same volumetric flow $Q$. This means we set $Q_{\\text{disease}} = Q_{\\text{baseline}} = Q$.\n\nThe pressure drops in the two states are:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{baseline}} = Q R_{\\text{baseline}}$$\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{disease}} = Q R_{\\text{disease}}$$\n\nWe are asked to compute the \"severity index\" $S$, defined as $S \\equiv \\Delta P_{\\text{disease}}/\\Delta P_{\\text{baseline}}$. We can now calculate this ratio:\n$$S = \\frac{\\Delta P_{\\text{disease}}}{\\Delta P_{\\text{baseline}}} = \\frac{Q R_{\\text{disease}}}{Q R_{\\text{baseline}}}$$\nSince $Q$ is constant, it cancels out:\n$$S = \\frac{R_{\\text{disease}}}{R_{\\text{baseline}}}$$\nSubstituting the relationship we found between $R_{\\text{disease}}$ and $R_{\\text{baseline}}$:\n$$S = \\frac{16 R_{\\text{baseline}}}{R_{\\text{baseline}}} = 16$$\n\nTherefore, to maintain the same volumetric airflow through the bronchiole, the driving pressure drop must increase by a factor of $16$. The severity index $S$ is $16$. This demonstrates the profound physiological impact of a seemingly modest reduction in airway radius, as the required work of breathing (proportional to $\\Delta P$) increases dramatically.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{16}$$", "id": "5199330"}, {"introduction": "Accurate and timely diagnosis is critical for managing RSV outbreaks, especially in pediatric populations.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n## SOLUTION\n\nWe begin by formally defining the events and quantities involved. Let $D^+$ be the event that a patient has the disease (RSV-positive by PCR) and $D^-$ be the event that a patient does not have the disease (RSV-negative by PCR). Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive antigen test and $T^-$ be the event of a negative antigen test.\n\nThe provided data can be organized into a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table:\n\n|                   | Disease Present ($D^+$) | Disease Absent ($D^-$) | Total     |\n|-------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|-----------|\n| Test Positive ($T^+$) | TP = $112$              | FP = $18$              | $130$     |\n| Test Negative ($T^-$) | FN = $38$               | TN = $432$             | $470$     |\n| Total             | $150$                   | $450$                  | $600$     |\n\nHere, TP denotes True Positives, FP denotes False Positives, FN denotes False Negatives, and TN denotes True Negatives.\n\n### Part 1: Sensitivity and Specificity\n\nSensitivity ($Se$) is the probability of a positive test result given that the disease is present, $P(T^+|D^+)$. It is the proportion of true positives among all individuals with the disease.\n$$\nSe = \\frac{\\text{TP}}{\\text{TP} + \\text{FN}}\n$$\nUsing the given values:\n$$\nSe = \\frac{112}{112 + 38} = \\frac{112}{150} = 0.74666...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the sensitivity is $0.7467$.\n\nSpecificity ($Sp$) is the probability of a negative test result given that the disease is absent, $P(T^-|D^-)$. It is the proportion of true negatives among all individuals without the disease.\n$$\nSp = \\frac{\\text{TN}}{\\text{TN} + \\text{FP}}\n$$\nUsing the given values:\n$$\nSp = \\frac{432}{432 + 18} = \\frac{432}{450} = 0.96\n$$\nAs an exact decimal, the specificity is $0.96$. To four significant figures, this is written as $0.9600$.\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of PPV and NPV as Functions of Prevalence\n\nThe positive predictive value ($PPV$) is the probability that a patient with a positive test result truly has the disease, $P(D^+|T^+)$. The negative predictive value ($NPV$) is the probability that a patient with a negative test result truly does not have the disease, $P(D^-|T^-)$. These values depend on the prevalence of the disease in the population being tested, which we denote as $p = P(D^+)$. Consequently, $P(D^-) = 1-p$.\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem, the expression for PPV is:\n$$\nPPV(p) = P(D^+|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D^+)P(D^+)}{P(T^+)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test, found using the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(T^+) = P(T^+|D^+)P(D^+) + P(T^+|D^-)P(D^-)\n$$\nWe identify $P(T^+|D^+) = Se$ and $P(T^+|D^-) = 1 - P(T^-|D^-) = 1 - Sp$. Substituting these into the expression for $P(T^+)$ and then into the PPV formula yields the desired expression:\n$$\nPPV(p) = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{Se \\cdot p + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)}\n$$\nSimilarly, for NPV, we use Bayes' theorem:\n$$\nNPV(p) = P(D^-|T^-) = \\frac{P(T^-|D^-)P(D^-)}{P(T^-)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test:\n$$\nP(T^-) = P(T^-|D^-)P(D^-) + P(T^-|D^+)P(D^+)\n$$\nWe identify $P(T^-|D^-) = Sp$ and $P(T^-|D^+) = 1 - P(T^+|D^+) = 1 - Se$. Substituting these yields the expression for NPV:\n$$\nNPV(p) = \\frac{Sp \\cdot (1 - p)}{Sp \\cdot (1-p) + (1 - Se)p}\n$$\nThese are the general expressions for PPV and NPV as functions of prevalence $p$ and the test characteristics $Se$ and $Sp$.\n\n### Part 3: Evaluation for Specific Prevalences\n\nWe now use the derived expressions and the calculated values of $Se = \\frac{112}{150}$ and $Sp = \\frac{432}{450} = 0.96$ to find the predictive values for the given prevalences.\nThe other required quantities are $1-Sp = 1 - 0.96 = 0.04$ and $1-Se = 1 - \\frac{112}{150} = \\frac{38}{150}$.\n\n**Scenario 1: Prevalence $p_1 = 0.08$**\n\n$$\nPPV(0.08) = \\frac{(\\frac{112}{150})(0.08)}{(\\frac{112}{150})(0.08) + (0.04)(1 - 0.08)} = \\frac{0.74666... \\times 0.08}{0.74666... \\times 0.08 + 0.04 \\times 0.92} = \\frac{0.059733...}{0.059733... + 0.0368} = \\frac{0.059733...}{0.096533...} \\approx 0.6188\n$$\n$$\nNPV(0.08) = \\frac{(0.96)(1 - 0.08)}{(0.96)(1 - 0.08) + (\\frac{38}{150})(0.08)} = \\frac{0.96 \\times 0.92}{0.96 \\times 0.92 + 0.25333... \\times 0.08} = \\frac{0.8832}{0.8832 + 0.020266...} = \\frac{0.8832}{0.903466...} \\approx 0.9776\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, for $p_1=0.08$, $PPV_1 = 0.6188$ and $NPV_1 = 0.9776$.\n\n**Scenario 2: Prevalence $p_2 = 0.35$**\n\n$$\nPPV(0.35) = \\frac{(\\frac{112}{150})(0.35)}{(\\frac{112}{150})(0.35) + (0.04)(1-0.35)} = \\frac{0.74666... \\times 0.35}{0.74666... \\times 0.35 + 0.04 \\times 0.65} = \\frac{0.26133...}{0.26133... + 0.026} = \\frac{0.26133...}{0.28733...} \\approx 0.9095\n$$\n$$\nNPV(0.35) = \\frac{(0.96)(1 - 0.35)}{(0.96)(1 - 0.35) + (\\frac{38}{150})(0.35)} = \\frac{0.96 \\times 0.65}{0.96 \\times 0.65 + 0.25333... \\times 0.35} = \\frac{0.624}{0.624 + 0.08866...} = \\frac{0.624}{0.71266...} \\approx 0.8756\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, for $p_2=0.35$, $PPV_2 = 0.9095$ and $NPV_2 = 0.8756$.\n\n### Final Results Assembly\nThe results are assembled into a single row matrix in the specified order: sensitivity ($Se$), specificity ($Sp$), $PPV(p_1)$, $NPV(p_1)$, $PPV(p_2)$, $NPV(p_2)$.\n\n1.

We will model this using a one-compartment model with first-order elimination, starting from first principles.\n\nThe defining characteristic of a first-order elimination process is that the rate of change of the amount of drug in the body, $A(t)$, is directly proportional to the amount of drug present at time $t$.

By definition, at $t = t_{1/2}$, the concentration is half of the initial concentration, i.e., $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{C_0}{2}$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{C_0}{2} = C_0 \\exp(-k_e t_{1/2})\n    $$\n    Dividing by $C_0$ and taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $$\n    \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k_e t_{1/2}\n    $$\n    $$\n    -\\ln(2) = -k_e t_{1/2}\n    $$\n    Solving for $k_e$:\n    $$\n    k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{70} \\text{ days}^{-1}\n    $$\n\nNow we can write the specific equation for the nirsevimab concentration at any time $t$ (in days):\n$$\nC(t) = 200 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{70} t\\right)\n$$\n\nThe problem requires us to compute the end-of-month trough concentrations $C(t_n)$ at times $t_n = 30n$ days, for $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\n\nFor $n=1$ ($t_1 = 30$ days):\n$$\nC(30) = 200 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{30 \\ln(2)}{70}\\right) = 200 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3 \\ln(2)}{7}\\right) \\approx 148.602 \\text{ mg/L}\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $C(30) = 148.6$ mg/L.\n\nFor $n=2$ ($t_2 = 60$ days):\n$$\nC(60) = 200 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{60 \\ln(2)}{70}\\right) = 200 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{6 \\ln(2)}{7}\\right) \\approx 110.404 \\text{ mg/L}\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $C(60) = 110.4$ mg/L.\n\nFor $n=3$ ($t_3 = 90$ days):\n$$\nC(90) = 200 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{90 \\ln(2)}{70}\\right) = 200 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{9 \\ln(2)}{7}\\right) \\approx 82.032 \\text{ mg/L}\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $C(90) = 82.03$ mg/L.\n\nFor $n=4$ ($t_4 = 120$ days):\n$$\nC(120) = 200 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{120 \\ln(2)}{70}\\right) = 200 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{12 \\ln(2)}{7}\\right) \\approx 60.952 \\text{ mg/L}\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $C(120) = 60.95$ mg/L.\n\nFor $n=5$ ($t_5 = 150$ days):\n$$\nC(150) = 200 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{150 \\ln(2)}{70}\\right) = 200 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{15 \\ln(2)}{7}\\right) \\approx 45.286 \\text{ mg/L}\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $C(150) = 45.29$ mg/L.\n\nFinally, we must determine for how many of these $5$ months the trough concentration $C(t_n)$ is at or above the protective threshold concentration $T = 60$ mg/L.\n\n- Month 1: $C(30) = 148.6 \\text{ mg/L} \\ge 60 \\text{ mg/L}$.
