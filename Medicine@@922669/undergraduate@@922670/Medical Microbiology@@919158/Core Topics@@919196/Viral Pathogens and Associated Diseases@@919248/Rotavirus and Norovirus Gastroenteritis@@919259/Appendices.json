The attack rate is a fundamental tool for this purpose, measuring the proportion of an exposed group that becomes ill. This exercise challenges you to apply this core epidemiological concept to compare the transmissibility of two hypothetical outbreaks, illustrating how simple calculations can yield powerful insights into the characteristics of different pathogens like norovirus and rotavirus.

In a residence-hall dining event suspected to be norovirus, there were $45$ symptomatic cases among $150$ exposed individuals within $48$ hours of a single meal. In a daycare cluster suspected to be rotavirus, there were $12$ symptomatic cases among $60$ exposed children over the same short window following a single shared snack. Treat each as a point-source exposure with similar susceptibility across those exposed. Using only the foundational epidemiological definition of attack rate for point-source outbreaks and reasoning from first principles about how relative transmissibility can be inferred from comparative attack rates when exposure opportunities are comparable, compute the ratio of the norovirus event’s attack rate to the rotavirus event’s attack rate.

This phenomenon is frequently rooted in host genetics, specifically the 'secretor status' which determines if the viral docking sites are present on mucosal surfaces. This practice delves into this fascinating intersection of virology and genetics, asking you to calculate how population-level attack rates are shaped by the proportion of susceptible individuals in a group.

Norovirus strains that dominate such outbreaks commonly use histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) for attachment, and individuals with a functional fucosyltransferase $2$ gene (secretor-positive phenotype) express HBGAs in mucosal secretions and are therefore biologically susceptible, whereas secretor-negative individuals are effectively non-susceptible for these strains. Assume a single shared exposure event occurred in a dining hall salad that was consumed by $200$ individuals. The secretor-positive prevalence in this population is $0.80$.

However, a vaccine's success is not just determined in the lab; it must be measured in the real world.

All hospitalizations attributed to rotavirus were laboratory-confirmed to exclude norovirus and other causes. Two comparable cohorts of children under $5$ years of age were followed for the same duration: one cohort had received rotavirus vaccination and the other cohort had not. Over the observation period, the cumulative incidence of rotavirus-associated hospitalization was $3$ per $1000$ in the vaccinated cohort and $15$ per $1000$ in the unvaccinated cohort. Assume equal person-time and no differential loss to follow-up, and that the reported values represent cumulative incidences for the same time window.\n\nUsing the foundational epidemiologic definitions that cumulative incidence quantifies risk over a specified period, that relative risk (RR) compares risks between exposed and unexposed groups, and that vaccine effectiveness (VE) is the proportional reduction in risk attributable to vaccination compared to no vaccination, derive from first principles an expression for vaccine effectiveness in terms of relative risk. Then evaluate the vaccine effectiveness numerically from the data provided. Express your final answer as a decimal or a fraction without a percentage sign. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The primary task is to first derive a general expression for vaccine effectiveness ($VE$) in terms of relative risk ($RR$) from the fundamental definitions provided, and then to apply this expression to the given data.\n\nLet $R_{vac}$ be the risk of rotavirus-associated hospitalization in the vaccinated cohort, and let $R_{unvac}$ be the risk of the same outcome in the unvaccinated cohort. The problem states that cumulative incidence ($CI$) quantifies risk over the specified period. Therefore, we can write:\n$R_{vac} = CI_{vac}$\n$R_{unvac} = CI_{unvac}$\n\nThe problem defines vaccine effectiveness ($VE$) as the proportional reduction in risk in the vaccinated group compared to the unvaccinated group. The risk in the unvaccinated group, $R_{unvac}$, serves as the baseline risk. The absolute reduction in risk due to vaccination is the difference $R_{unvac} - R_{vac}$. The proportional reduction is this difference divided by the baseline risk:\n$$ VE = \\frac{R_{unvac} - R_{vac}}{R_{unvac}} $$\n\nThis expression can be algebraically simplified:\n$$ VE = \\frac{R_{unvac}}{R_{unvac}} - \\frac{R_{vac}}{R_{unvac}} $$\n$$ VE = 1 - \\frac{R_{vac}}{R_{unvac}} $$\n\nNext, we consider the definition of relative risk ($RR$). It is defined as the ratio of risk in the exposed group (here, the vaccinated cohort) to the risk in the unexposed group (the unvaccinated cohort):\n$$ RR = \\frac{R_{vac}}{R_{unvac}} $$\n\nBy substituting the expression for $RR$ into the simplified equation for $VE$, we arrive at the desired relationship between vaccine effectiveness and relative risk:\n$$ VE = 1 - RR $$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nNow, we evaluate the vaccine effectiveness numerically using the data from the cohort study.\nThe given cumulative incidences are:\n- $CI_{vac} = 3$ per $1000 = \\frac{3}{1000} = 0.003$\n- $CI_{unvac} = 15$ per $1000 = \\frac{15}{1000} = 0.015$\n\nUsing these values as the risks for each group, we first calculate the relative risk ($RR$):\n$$ RR = \\frac{R_{vac}}{R_{unvac}} = \\frac{CI_{vac}}{CI_{unvac}} = \\frac{0.003}{0.015} $$\n$$ RR = \\frac{3}{15} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2 $$\n\nFinally, we use the derived formula $VE = 1 - RR$ to calculate the vaccine effectiveness:\n$$ VE = 1 - 0.2 $$\n$$ VE = 0.8 $$\n\nThe vaccine effectiveness is $0.8$.
