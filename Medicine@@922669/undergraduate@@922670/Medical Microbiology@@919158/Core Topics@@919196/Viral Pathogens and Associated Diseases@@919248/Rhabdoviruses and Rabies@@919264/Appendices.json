The concept of transcriptional polarity, where genes proximal to the $3'$ promoter are expressed at higher levels than distal genes due to probabilistic termination/reinitiation at intergenic regions, is a fundamental principle in the study of these viruses. The assumptions provided are standard simplifications used to create a tractable quantitative model of this process. The problem is firmly based on established principles of molecular virology.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information: the gene order, the probabilistic rule for transcription, and a set of simplifying assumptions. It asks for a specific, derivable expression and a subsequent numerical calculation. The goal is clear, and a unique, stable solution exists based on the provided model.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims. The parameters ($p$, gene order) are clearly defined.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed. It is scientifically sound, well-defined, and objective.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\nThe problem asks for the relative steady-state abundances of the mRNAs for the five genes of the rabies virus, ordered $N, P, M, G, L$ from the $3^{\\prime}$ to the $5^{\\prime}$ end of the genome template. The model is based on sequential transcription with a probabilistic attenuation at each gene junction.\n\nLet $A_k$ represent the relative abundance of the mRNA for gene $k$, where $k \\in \\{N, P, M, G, L\\}$. According to the problem statement, the steady-state abundances are proportional to the synthesis rates. The synthesis rate of a given gene's mRNA is proportional to the number of RdRp complexes that successfully initiate transcription for that gene.\n\nLet us normalize the flux of RdRp initiating at the $3^{\\prime}$ leader (promoter) to be $1$.\nThe first gene is $N$. As it is the first gene, all RdRp complexes that initiate at the promoter will transcribe it. Therefore, the relative synthesis rate, and thus abundance, is proportional to $1$. We set $A_N = 1$ as per the normalization requirement.\n$$A_N = 1$$\n\nTo transcribe the second gene, $P$, the RdRp must first transcribe gene $N$ and then successfully reinitiate at the $N-P$ junction. The probability of this reinitiation (continuation) is given as $1-p$. The events are independent. Thus, the abundance of $P$ mRNA relative to $N$ mRNA is:\n$$A_P = A_N \\times (1-p) = 1 \\times (1-p) = 1-p$$\n\nTo transcribe the third gene, $M$, the RdRp must successfully cross two junctions: the $N-P$ junction and the $P-M$ junction. Since each crossing is an independent event with probability $1-p$, the total probability of an RdRp reaching the start of the $M$ gene is $(1-p) \\times (1-p) = (1-p)^2$. The abundance of $M$ mRNA is:\n$$A_M = A_N \\times (1-p) \\times (1-p) = (1-p)^2$$\n\nThis establishes a geometric progression. For the $j$-th gene in the sequence (where $j=1$ for $N$, $j=2$ for $P$, etc.), the RdRp must successfully cross $j-1$ junctions. The relative abundance is therefore given by the general formula:\n$$A_j = (1-p)^{j-1}$$\n\nApplying this formula to the five genes $N, P, M, G, L$ (corresponding to $j=1, 2, 3, 4, 5$ respectively):\n- Abundance of $N$ ($j=1$): $A_N = (1-p)^{1-1} = (1-p)^0 = 1$\n- Abundance of $P$ ($j=2$): $A_P = (1-p)^{2-1} = (1-p)^1$\n- Abundance of $M$ ($j=3$): $A_M = (1-p)^{3-1} = (1-p)^2$\n- Abundance of $G$ ($j=4$): $A_G = (1-p)^{4-1} = (1-p)^3$\n- Abundance of $L$ ($j=5$): $A_L = (1-p)^{5-1} = (1-p)^4$\n\nThe closed-form expression for the vector of relative abundances $[A_N, A_P, A_M, A_G, A_L]$, normalized to $A_N=1$, is:\n$$[1, (1-p), (1-p)^2, (1-p)^3, (1-p)^4]$$\n\nNext, we must evaluate this expression for the given attenuation probability $p=0.25$.\nThe continuation probability is $1-p = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\n\nWe calculate the numerical values for each relative abundance:\n- $A_N = (0.75)^0 = 1$\n- $A_P = (0.75)^1 = 0.75$\n- $A_M = (0.75)^2 = 0.5625$\n- $A_G = (0.75)^3 = 0.421875$\n- $A_L = (0.75)^4 = 0.31640625$\n\nThe problem requires rounding each value to four significant figures.\n- $A_N = 1 \\rightarrow 1.000$\n- $A_P = 0.75 \\rightarrow 0.7500$\n- $A_M = 0.5625 \\rightarrow 0.5625$\n- $A_G = 0.421875 \\rightarrow 0.4219$ (The fifth significant digit is $7$, so we round the fourth digit `8` up to `9`)\n- $A_L = 0.31640625 \\rightarrow 0.3164$ (The fifth significant digit is $0$, so we round down)\n\nThe final normalized relative abundances for $N:P:M:G:L$ are $1.000:0.7500:0.5625:0.4219:0.3164$.
