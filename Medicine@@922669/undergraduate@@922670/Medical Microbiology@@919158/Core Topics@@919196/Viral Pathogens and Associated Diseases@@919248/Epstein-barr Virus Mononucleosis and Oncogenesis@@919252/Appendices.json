The patient, a young adult, exhibits the characteristic triad of fever, pharyngitis, and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, along with significant fatigue, splenomegaly, and palatal petechiae. Laboratory findings, including lymphocytosis with a high percentage of atypical lymphocytes (activated CD8+ T-cells) and mild transaminitis, further support this diagnosis. A crucial clinical clue is the development of a diffuse morbilliform rash after amoxicillin administration, a phenomenon that occurs in over 90% of patients with EBV-induced IM.\n\nThe negative heterophile antibody (Monospot) test on day 5 of the illness does not rule out EBV. This test can have a false-negative rate of up to 25% in the first week of symptoms. Therefore, a more specific and sensitive test is required for confirmation.\n\n*   **A. Repeat heterophile antibody (Monospot) testing in 2 weeks:** This would delay the diagnosis and might still be negative, as about 10% of adults with EBV IM never develop heterophile antibodies. It is not the most definitive next step.\n*   **B. Epstein-Barr virus viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM serology:** Antibodies of the IgM class against the viral capsid antigen (VCA-IgM) are the gold standard serological marker for acute primary EBV infection. They appear early in the illness and are highly specific. A positive VCA-IgM test would confirm the diagnosis.\n*   **C. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR):** While acute HIV can present with a mononucleosis-like illness, the clinical picture, particularly the amoxicillin rash, makes EBV far more likely. Testing for EBV first is the most logical step.\n*   **D. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgM and IgG serology with IgG avidity testing:** CMV is a cause of heterophile-negative mononucleosis, but it typically causes less severe pharyngitis and is not associated with the amoxicillin rash. EBV remains the most probable diagnosis.\n*   **E. Throat culture for Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes):** The negative rapid antigen test and the systemic nature of the illness (fatigue, splenomegaly, atypical lymphocytosis) make a primary bacterial pharyngitis highly unlikely to be the sole diagnosis.\n\nTherefore, the single best next test to confirm the most likely diagnosis of acute EBV infection is VCA-IgM serology.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4629444"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis is suspected, the next step is to understand the dynamics of the infection within the host.
