It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Governing Equations\n\nI will construct the system of ordinary differential equations by translating each stated principle into a mathematical term for the rates of change $\\frac{dT}{dt}$, $\\frac{dI}{dt}$, and $\\frac{dV}{dt}$.\n\n1.  **Rate of change of susceptible cells, $\\frac{dT}{dt}$**:\n    -   The population of susceptible cells, $T$, decreases when they become infected.\n    -   Principle (i) states that the rate of new infections is proportional to the product of $T$ and $V$, with the proportionality constant given as $\\beta$. This process represents a loss from the susceptible pool.\n    -   Therefore, this interaction contributes a term $-\\beta T V$ to the equation for $T$.\n    -   The problem explicitly states that \"homeostatic replenishment and natural death of uninfected cells are negligible\". Thus, no other terms (like a source term for new T-cells or a natural death term like $-\\alpha T$) are included.\n    -   The resulting equation is: $$\\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\beta T V$$\n\n2.  **Rate of change of infected cells, $\\frac{dI}{dt}$**:\n    -   The population of infected cells, $I$, increases when susceptible cells become infected. This rate is precisely the rate at which susceptible cells are lost to infection.\n    -   This contributes a source term of $+\\beta T V$.\n    -   Principle (ii) states that \"productively infected cells are lost at a constant per capita rate\", with the rate constant given as $\\delta$. A constant per capita removal rate translates to a term proportional to the population size, $I$.\n    -   This contributes a loss term of $-\\delta I$.\n    -   Combining the source and loss terms, the resulting equation is: $$\\frac{dI}{dt} = \\beta T V - \\delta I$$\n\n3.  **Rate of change of free virus, $\\frac{dV}{dt}$**:\n    -   The population of free virus, $V$, increases due to production by infected cells.\n    -   Principle (iii) states that \"each productively infected cell produces new free virions at a constant per capita rate\", with the rate constant given as $p$. This means the total production rate is proportional to the number of infected cells, $I$.\n    -   This contributes a source term of $+p I$.\n    -   The population of free virus, $V$, decreases due to clearance.\n    -   Principle (iv) states that \"free virions are cleared from plasma at a constant per virion rate\", with the rate constant given as $c$. A constant \"per virion\" rate is a per capita rate for the virus population.\n    -   This contributes a loss term of $-c V$.\n    -   Note: Standard models of this type often assume that the number of virions that are \"used up\" in the process of infecting cells is negligible compared to the total number of virions cleared by other mechanisms. The problem statement's separation of principles (i) and (iv) supports this, by defining infection as an encounter process and clearance as a separate removal process. Therefore, we do not include a $-\\beta T V$ term in the virus equation.\n    -   Combining the source and loss terms, the resulting equation is: $$\\frac{dV}{dt} = p I - c V$$\n\n**Assembled System:**\nThe complete system of differential equations is:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\beta T V \\\\\n\\frac{dI}{dt} = \\beta T V - \\delta I \\\\\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = p I - c V\n$$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow, I will evaluate each of the given options against this derived system.\n\n**A. $$\\frac{dT}{dt}=-\\beta\\,T\\,V,\\quad \\frac{dI}{dt}=\\beta\\,T\\,V-\\delta\\,I,\\quad \\frac{dV}{dt}=p\\,I-c\\,V.$$**\nThis system of equations perfectly matches the one derived from the first principles outlined in the problem statement. Each term corresponds correctly to the described biological process and uses the appropriately defined parameter.\n-   $\\frac{dT}{dt}$: Correctly models loss of susceptible cells via infection with free virus.\n-   $\\frac{dI}{dt}$: Correctly models the gain of infected cells from new infections and their loss due to death.\n-   $\\frac{dV}{dt}$: Correctly models the production of virions by infected cells and their clearance from the plasma.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $$\\frac{dT}{dt}=-\\beta\\,T\\,I,\\quad \\frac{dI}{dt}=\\beta\\,T\\,I-\\delta\\,I,\\quad \\frac{dV}{dt}=p\\,I-c\\,V.$$**\nThis option models infection via a term $\\beta T I$. This implies that infection occurs through direct contact between susceptible cells ($T$) and infected cells ($I$). However, principle (i) explicitly states that \"infection occurs when free virions encounter susceptible target cells\", which is mathematically represented as $\\beta T V$. This option models cell-to-cell transmission, which contradicts the given mechanism.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $$\\frac{dT}{dt}=-\\beta\\,T\\,V,\\quad \\frac{dI}{dt}=\\beta\\,T\\,V-\\delta\\,I,\\quad \\frac{dV}{dt}=\\beta\\,I-c\\,V.$$**\nIn this option, the equation for $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ is given as $\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\beta I - c V$. The production term for the virus is $\\beta I$. This is incorrect. The parameter for virus production by an infected cell is defined as $p$, not $\\beta$. The parameter $\\beta$ is the infection rate constant. This option incorrectly swaps the virus production rate constant ($p$) with the infection rate constant ($\\beta$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $$\\frac{dT}{dt}=-\\beta\\,T\\,V,\\quad \\frac{dI}{dt}=p\\,I-\\delta\\,I,\\quad \\frac{dV}{dt}=\\beta\\,T\\,V-c\\,V.$$**\nThis option contains multiple errors.\n-   In the $\\frac{dI}{dt}$ equation, the source term is $pI$. This term represents the rate of virus production, not the rate of new infected cell creation. The correct source term for infected cells is $\\beta T V$.\n-   In the $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ equation, the source term is $\\beta T V$. This term represents the rate at which susceptible cells become infected, not the rate at which new virus particles are produced. The correct source term for virions is $pI$.\nThis option fundamentally confuses the creation of infected cells with the production of virions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. $$\\frac{dT}{dt}=-\\beta\\,T\\,V-\\delta\\,T,\\quad \\frac{dI}{dt}=\\beta\\,T\\,V-c\\,I,\\quad \\frac{dV}{dt}=p\\,I-\\delta\\,V.$$**\nThis option misuses several parameters.\n-   In the $\\frac{dT}{dt}$ equation, the term $-\\delta T$ is added. $\\delta$ is the death rate constant for *infected* cells ($I$), not susceptible cells ($T$). Furthermore, the problem states that the natural death of uninfected cells is negligible.\n-   In the $\\frac{dI}{dt}$ equation, the loss term is $-c I$. $c$ is the clearance rate constant for *free virus* ($V$), not for infected cells ($I$). The correct loss term is $-\\delta I$.\n-   In the $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ equation, the clearance term is $-\\delta V$. $\\delta$ is the death rate constant for *infected cells* ($I$), not the clearance rate for virus ($V$). The correct clearance term is $-c V$.\nEvery equation in this system contains at least one incorrectly applied parameter.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4671851"}, {"introduction": "The first step in the viral life cycle, attachment to a host cell, is a critical determinant of infection efficiency.

It provides all necessary information to derive a unique solution based on fundamental principles of chemical equilibrium.\n\nLet $[G]$ represent the concentration of free $gp120$, $[C]$ represent the concentration of free CD4, and $[GC]$ represent the concentration of the $gp120$-CD4 complex. The binding reaction is a reversible $1{:}1$ interaction:\n$$ G + C \\rightleftharpoons GC $$\nAccording to the law of mass action, the equilibrium state is described by the dissociation constant, $K_d$. The problem defines $K_d$ as the ratio of the product of free reactant concentrations to the complex concentration:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[G][C]}{[GC]} $$\nThe total concentration of $gp120$, denoted as $[G]_T$, is the sum of its free and bound forms:\n$$ [G]_T = [G] + [GC] $$\nThe objective is to find the fraction of occupied $gp120$, which we shall denote as $\\theta$.

This condition, $[G]_T \\ll [{\\mathrm{CD4}}]_T$, means that even if all $gp120$ were to bind to CD4, the amount of CD4 bound in the complex, $[GC]$, would be negligible compared to the total CD4 concentration. Therefore, the concentration of free CD4, $[C]$, can be accurately approximated by the total CD4 concentration, $[{\\mathrm{CD4}}]_T$.\n$$ [C] = [{\\mathrm{CD4}}]_T - [GC] \\approx [{\\mathrm{CD4}}]_T $$\nUsing this approximation, we can substitute $[C]$ with the given value for $[{\\mathrm{CD4}}]_T$ in our derived expression for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[{\\mathrm{CD4}}]_T}{K_d + [{\\mathrm{CD4}}]_T} $$\nNow, we can substitute the numerical values into this equation to compute the fraction of occupied $gp120$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{50~\\mathrm{nM}}{10~\\mathrm{nM} + 50~\\mathrm{nM}} = \\frac{50}{60} = \\frac{5}{6} $$\nTo express this fraction as a unitless decimal rounded to three significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$ \\theta \\approx 0.8333... $$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $\\theta = 0.833$.\n\nInterpretation:\nThe calculated fraction of occupancy, $\\theta = 0.833$, indicates that at equilibrium, approximately $83.3\\%$ of the $gp120$ molecules on the virion surface are bound to CD4 receptors. The dissociation constant, $K_d = 10~\\mathrm{nM}$, represents the concentration of free ligand (in this case, CD4) at which $50\\%$ of the binding sites (on $gp120$) are occupied. The local CD4 concentration of $50~\\mathrm{nM}$ is five times greater than the $K_d$. This high ratio of ligand concentration to the dissociation constant ($[{\\mathrm{CD4}}]_T / K_d = 5$) drives the binding equilibrium strongly in favor of complex formation, resulting in high receptor occupancy. This implies that the initial attachment of HIV to a target T cell is a very efficient process, maximizing the probability of the virus anchoring to the cell surface once it is in close proximity. However, it is crucial to recognize that this efficient attachment is only the first of several steps required for viral entry. Subsequent events, such as conformational changes in $gp120$ and the binding to a chemokine co-receptor (e.g., CCR5 or CXCR4), are also necessary for membrane fusion and productive infection to occur.

HIV employs an elegant molecular trick called ribosomal frameshifting to precisely control the ratio of its structural proteins (Gag) to its enzymatic proteins (Pol) [@problem_id:4671876]. This problem explores the consequences of disrupting this delicate balance, demonstrating how a small change in translational efficiency can have profound effects on the assembly and infectivity of new virions.", "problem": "A research team studying the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) introduces a single-nucleotide change into the *gag-pol* junction slippery sequence that mediates the ribosomal minus one frameshift.

It contains no contradictions, missing information, or other flaws that would render it invalid. The solution process may proceed.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe problem requires a two-part analysis: first, a quantitative assessment of the change in the Pol-to-Gag protein ratio, and second, an inference of the biological consequences based on the known functions of these proteins.\n\n**Part 1: Quantitative Effect on Pol:Gag Ratio**\nIn the HIV life cycle, a single species of full-length, unspliced messenger RNA (mRNA) serves as the template for the synthesis of both Gag and the Gag-Pol polyprotein. Translation initiates at the start codon of the *gag* open reading frame (ORF).\n\n1.  A ribosome translating this mRNA will produce the Gag protein if it terminates translation at the *gag* stop codon. The probability of this event is $(1 - p_{\\mathrm{FS}})$.\n2.  Alternatively, the ribosome can undergo a $-1$ ribosomal frameshift at the \"slippery sequence\" just before the *gag* stop codon. This event allows the ribosome to bypass the stop codon and continue translation into the overlapping *pol* ORF, thereby producing the Gag-Pol fusion polyprotein. The probability of this event is $p_{\\mathrm{FS}}$.\n\nThe amount of Pol protein produced is directly proportional to the amount of Gag-Pol fusion protein synthesized. The molar ratio of Gag-Pol to Gag proteins synthesized is a key determinant of virion composition. This ratio can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Molecules of Gag-Pol}}{\\text{Molecules of Gag}} = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{FS}}}{1 - p_{\\mathrm{FS}}}\n$$\nSince $p_{\\mathrm{FS}} \\ll 1$, the denominator $(1 - p_{\\mathrm{FS}})$ is approximately equal to $1$. Therefore, the ratio of Gag-Pol to Gag is approximately equal to the frameshift probability, $p_{\\mathrm{FS}}$. This ratio directly reflects the relative production of Pol to Gag.\n\nLet's calculate this ratio for both the wild-type and the mutant virus.\n- **Wild-Type Ratio ($R_{\\mathrm{WT}}$):**\n  $$R_{\\mathrm{WT}} \\approx p_{\\mathrm{FS}} = 0.05$$\n  This corresponds to approximately $1$ Gag-Pol molecule for every $20$ Gag molecules.\n\n- **Mutant Ratio ($R_{\\mathrm{mutant}}$):**\n  $$R_{\\mathrm{mutant}} \\approx p_{\\mathrm{FS}}' = 0.005$$\n  This corresponds to approximately $1$ Gag-Pol molecule for every $200$ Gag molecules.\n\nTo find the quantitative effect, we compare the mutant ratio to the wild-type ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{mutant}}}{R_{\\mathrm{WT}}} = \\frac{0.005}{0.05} = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1\n$$\nThis calculation shows that the mutation causes a $10$-fold reduction in the production of Pol relative to Gag. A factor of $10$ is equivalent to one order of magnitude.\n\n**Part 2: Consequences for Virion Maturation and Infectivity**\nThe Pol polyprotein contains the viral enzymes essential for the entire replication cycle:\n- **Protease (PR):** Cleaves the Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins into their individual, mature functional proteins. This proteolytic processing is a critical step for virion maturation, which transforms a non-infectious, immature particle into an infectious virion with a condensed conical core.\n- **Reverse Transcriptase (RT):** Converts the viral RNA genome into a double-stranded DNA copy upon infection of a new cell.\n- **Integrase (IN):** Inserts the viral DNA into the host cell's chromosome.\n\nA $10$-fold decrease in the amount of Pol incorporated into virions will have severe consequences:\n1.  **Insufficient Protease:** The concentration of viral protease within the newly budded virion will be drastically reduced. This will lead to inefficient or completely blocked proteolytic cleavage of the Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins.\n2.  **Defective Maturation:** Without proper cleavage, the structural proteins (e.g., capsid) cannot rearrange to form the mature, conical core. The virions will be arrested in an immature state, characterized by an electron-dense layer of unprocessed Gag polyprotein beneath the viral envelope.\n3.  **Loss of Infectivity:** Immature virions are non-infectious. Furthermore, the resulting particles will also lack sufficient quantities of reverse transcriptase and integrase, rendering them incapable of establishing a new infection even if they were to enter a host cell.\n\nIn summary, the mutation leads to the production of Gag-rich, Pol-poor virions that are structurally immature and functionally inert, resulting in a dramatic reduction in infectivity.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Pol production decreases relative to Gag by approximately an order of magnitude, yielding Gag-rich particles with insufficient protease activity, defective Gag processing, immature morphology, and markedly reduced infectivity.**\n- The quantitative prediction, \"decreases...by approximately an order of magnitude,\" is correct as derived ($0.05 \\to 0.005$ is a factor of $10$).\n- The subsequent chain of reasoning is entirely correct: reduced Pol leads to insufficient protease, which causes defective Gag processing, resulting in immature morphology and a loss of infectivity.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Pol production increases relative to Gag, causing excessive protease levels that enhance Gag processing and lead to hypermature particles with higher infectivity.**\n- The initial premise, \"Pol production increases,\" is false. The frameshift probability decreased, leading to a decrease in Pol production. All subsequent conclusions are therefore based on a false premise.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The Pol:Gag ratio is unchanged because frameshifting is redundant in HIV; Pol is translated from a separate messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) independently of gag.**\n- This statement makes a factually incorrect claim about HIV biology. Pol is translated via frameshifting from the same mRNA as Gag; this mechanism is essential, not redundant. The problem statement itself defines frameshifting as the mechanism being studied.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Pol is completely absent from mutant virions, but replication is maintained because host cell proteases compensate for the lack of viral protease during maturation.**\n- This option contains two major errors. First, Pol is not completely absent; its production is reduced to $10\\%$ of the wild-type level ($p_{\\mathrm{FS}}' = 0.005$, not $0$). Second, host cell proteases are not specific for HIV polyprotein cleavage sites and cannot compensate for the lack of viral protease. Virion maturation is strictly dependent on the viral protease. Thus, replication would not be maintained.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4671876"}]}
