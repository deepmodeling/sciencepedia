The validity of the problem will be assessed before a solution is provided.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- The virus is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus.\n- It encodes its proteins via a single long open reading frame, translated into one polyprotein.\n- Fact (i): Each amino acid is specified by a codon of $3$ nucleotides.\n- Fact (ii): The genome has untranslated regions (UTRs) at the $5^{\\prime}$ and $3^{\\prime}$ ends, making a full-genome length calculation an overestimation of the polyprotein size.\n- Fact (iii): The polyprotein is processed into $10$ distinct mature proteins.\n- Assumption: The HCV genome length is approximately $9600$ nucleotides.\n- Assumption: The translation coding rate is $3$ nucleotides per amino acid.\n- Task 1: Compute the approximate number of amino acids in the polyprotein.\n- Task 2: Infer the minimal number of distinct endoproteolytic cleavage events required to produce $10$ mature proteins from one polyprotein.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The description of HCV molecular biology aligns with established principles in virology, including its genome structure, the concept of a polyprotein, and the role of proteolytic processing. The central dogma's application to translation (a $3$-nucleotide codon specifying one amino acid) is a fundamental concept. The provided genome length of approximately $9600$ nucleotides and the production of $10$ mature proteins are factually correct for HCV.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information for the requested calculations. It explicitly acknowledges that using the full genome length is an approximation due to the presence of UTRs, thereby preventing ambiguity. The first part is a straightforward calculation based on the genetic code. The second part is a direct logical inference about partitioning a linear polymer.\n\nThe problem is objective, using precise, scientific language without subjective or opinion-based statements. It does not violate any of the criteria for an invalid problem.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be developed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe solution will be derived in two parts, corresponding to the two tasks in the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Approximate Number of Amino Acids in the Polyprotein**\n\nThe genetic information for protein synthesis is encoded in the nucleotide sequence of the viral RNA. The process of translation decodes this information. The fundamental unit of this code is the codon, a sequence of three consecutive nucleotides. Each codon, with the exception of three stop codons, specifies a single amino acid. The problem directs a calculation based on an average coding rate of $3$ nucleotides per amino acid, which is a direct consequence of this triplet code.\n\nLet $L_{\\text{genome}}$ be the total length of the HCV genome in nucleotides, and let $n_{\\text{nt/aa}}$ be the number of nucleotides per codon that specifies an amino acid.\nThe given values are:\n$L_{\\text{genome}} = 9600$ nucleotides\n$n_{\\text{nt/aa}} = 3$ nucleotides/amino acid\n\nThe problem asks for an approximate number of amino acids, $N_{\\text{aa}}$, in the polyprotein. This is calculated by dividing the total number of nucleotides by the number of nucleotides per amino acid. As noted in the problem statement, this approach uses the entire genome length and thus ignores the non-coding $5^{\\prime}$ and $3^{\\prime}$ untranslated regions (UTRs) as well as the stop codon that terminates translation. This simplification leads to an overestimate, but it provides the approximation requested.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n$$N_{\\text{aa}} = \\frac{L_{\\text{genome}}}{n_{\\text{nt/aa}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$N_{\\text{aa}} = \\frac{9600}{3} = 3200$$\nThus, the approximate number of amino acids in the HCV polyprotein is $3200$.\n\n**Part 2: Minimal Number of Endoproteolytic Cleavage Events**\n\nThe single polyprotein synthesized during translation is a contiguous linear chain of amino acids. To generate distinct, functional mature proteins, this chain must be cut at specific sites. This process is known as proteolytic cleavage. The problem states that $10$ distinct mature proteins are produced from this single polyprotein.\n\nLet $N_{\\text{proteins}}$ be the number of mature proteins, which is given as $10$.\nLet $N_{\\text{cleavages}}$ be the minimal number of cleavage events required.\n\nWe can model the polyprotein as a single line segment. To partition this single segment into $N_{\\text{proteins}}$ smaller, non-overlapping segments, a specific number of cuts must be made.\n- To obtain $2$ proteins, $1$ cut is required.\n- To obtain $3$ proteins, $2$ cuts are required.\n- Following this pattern, to obtain $N_{\\text{proteins}}$ from a single linear chain, $N_{\\text{proteins}} - 1$ cuts are necessary.\n\nThis logic assumes the proteins are arranged colinearly within the polyprotein and that no proteins are nested or generated by alternative splicing mechanisms, which is consistent with the standard model of HCV polyprotein processing. Each cut, or cleavage event, separates the chain into two, increasing the number of free polypeptide fragments by one. Starting with one polyprotein, the first cut yields two fragments. Each subsequent cut increases the number of fragments by one. Therefore, to reach a total of $N_{\\text{proteins}}$ fragments, $N_{\\text{proteins}} - 1$ cuts must be made.\n\nGiven $N_{\\text{proteins}} = 10$, the number of cleavage events is:\n$$N_{\\text{cleavages}} = N_{\\text{proteins}} - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9$$\nTherefore, a minimum of $9$ distinct endoproteolytic cleavage events are required to process the single HCV polyprotein into its $10$ mature protein products.\n\nThe final answers are to be reported in the specified order: (i) approximate number of amino acids, and (ii) number of cleavage events.\nThe calculated values are $3200$ and $9$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3200 & 9 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4637779"}, {"introduction": "A key measure of antiviral drug efficacy is the rate at which viral load declines in a patient.
