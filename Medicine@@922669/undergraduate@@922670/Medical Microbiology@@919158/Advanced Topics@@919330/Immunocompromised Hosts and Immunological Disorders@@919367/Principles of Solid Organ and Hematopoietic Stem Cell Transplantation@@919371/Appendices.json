The concepts of isohemagglutinin titers, immunoadsorption (a form of apheresis), and antibody rebound kinetics are standard in the field. The numerical values for titers, removal efficiency, and regeneration are plausible.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear initial state, a defined dynamic process, and a specific target condition. It asks for a minimum whole number of days, which implies a unique integer solution is expected.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using objective, quantitative language, free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides all necessary information to construct a mathematical model. The assumptions about constant fractional removal and proportional regeneration are simplifications, but they are clearly stated and consistent, allowing for the creation of a solvable discrete-time model. There are no contradictions in the givens.\n- **Realism**: The scenario is a standard clinical problem, and the modeling assumptions are common first-order approximations used in pharmacokinetics and immunodynamics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe core of the problem is to model the day-to-day evolution of the antibody level using a discrete-time dynamical system, specifically a first-order linear recurrence relation. The problem states that the antibody titer denominator is proportional to the antibody concentration. Therefore, we can work directly with the titer denominators to model the process.\n\nLet $T_n$ be the titer denominator measured on the morning of day $n$, just before the immunoadsorption session for that day. The initial condition is the baseline titer before any treatment begins. We can define this as the state on day $0$.\n$$ T_0 = 128 $$\nThe process for one full day, from the measurement on day $n$ to the measurement on day $n+1$, consists of two steps:\n1.  **Immunoadsorption**: The session on day $n$ removes $50\\%$ of the antibodies. The concentration, and thus the titer denominator, is reduced by this fraction. The level immediately after the session is $T_n \\times (1 - 0.50) = 0.5 T_n$.\n2.  **Regeneration**: Over the subsequent 24 hours (until the morning of day $n+1$), the antibody level increases by $10\\%$. This means the level is multiplied by a factor of $(1 + 0.10) = 1.1$.\n\nCombining these two steps, the titer denominator on the morning of day $n+1$, $T_{n+1}$, is related to the titer denominator on the morning of day $n$, $T_n$, as follows:\n$$ T_{n+1} = (0.5 T_n) \\times 1.1 $$\n$$ T_{n+1} = 0.55 T_n $$\nThis is a linear homogeneous recurrence relation with a constant coefficient, which describes a geometric progression. The solution can be expressed in a closed form by repeated application of the relation:\n$$ T_n = (0.55)^n T_0 $$\nSubstituting the initial condition $T_0 = 128$:\n$$ T_n = 128 \\times (0.55)^n $$\nThe transplant protocol requires the titer to be \"below $1\\!:\\!8$\". This means the titer denominator must be less than $8$. We need to find the minimum whole number of days, $n$, for which $T_n < 8$.\nWe set up the inequality:\n$$ 128 \\times (0.55)^n < 8 $$\nTo solve for $n$, we first isolate the exponential term:\n$$ (0.55)^n < \\frac{8}{128} $$\n$$ (0.55)^n < \\frac{1}{16} $$\nNow, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the inequality. Since the natural logarithm is a strictly increasing function, the direction of the inequality is preserved.\n$$ \\ln((0.55)^n) < \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{16}\\right) $$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a)$:\n$$ n \\ln(0.55) < \\ln(1) - \\ln(16) $$\n$$ n \\ln(0.55) < -\\ln(16) $$\nTo isolate $n$, we must divide by $\\ln(0.55)$. It is critical to note that since $0.55 < 1$, its natural logarithm, $\\ln(0.55)$, is a negative number. Dividing an inequality by a negative number reverses the direction of the inequality sign.\n$$ n > \\frac{-\\ln(16)}{\\ln(0.55)} $$\nThis can also be written as:\n$$ n > \\frac{\\ln(16)}{-\\ln(0.55)} = \\frac{\\ln(16)}{\\ln(1/0.55)} = \\frac{\\ln(16)}{\\ln(20/11)} $$\nNow we evaluate the numerical value:\n$$ \\ln(16) \\approx 2.7725887... $$\n$$ \\ln(0.55) \\approx -0.5978370... $$\n$$ n > \\frac{-2.7725887...}{-0.5978370...} \\approx 4.6378... $$\nSince $n$ must be a whole number of days, we must find the smallest integer $n$ that satisfies $n > 4.6378...$. This integer is $n=5$.\n\nTo verify, let's calculate the titer for $n=4$ and $n=5$:\nFor $n=4$ days:\n$$ T_4 = 128 \\times (0.55)^4 \\approx 128 \\times 0.09150625 \\approx 11.7128 $$\nThe titer denominator $11.7128$ is not less than $8$, so $4$ days are insufficient.\n\nFor $n=5$ days:\n$$ T_5 = 128 \\times (0.55)^5 \\approx 128 \\times 0.0503284375 \\approx 6.44204 $$\nThe titer denominator $6.44204$ is less than $8$.\n\nThus, on the morning of the 5th day, the titer will have fallen below the required threshold of $1\\!:\\!8$. This requires a total of 5 daily sessions.
