This exercise provides a quantitative basis for concepts that are central to genetic counseling and public health.", "problem": "A rare autosomal recessive Primary Immunodeficiency Disease (PID) is observed in a large, randomly mating human population. Epidemiologic surveillance suggests the disease prevalence is consistent with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium at a single locus, with the frequency of affected individuals given by $q^2 = \\frac{1}{10{,}000}$. Using the Hardy–Weinberg framework (allele frequencies $p$ and $q$ with $p + q = 1$) and the definition of the inbreeding coefficient $F$ as the probability that the two alleles at a locus in an individual are identical by descent, do the following:\n\n1. Derive the general expression for the carrier frequency under random mating and compute its value for the given prevalence.\n2. For offspring of first-cousin unions (consanguinity), use $F = \\frac{1}{16}$ to derive a general expression for the expected incidence of the autosomal recessive disease in the presence of inbreeding, and compute its value for the given prevalence.\n3.

Express all results as pure numbers without units.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically valid, well-posed, and contains all necessary information to proceed with a solution based on the principles of population genetics.\n\nLet the dominant (normal) allele be denoted by $A$ with frequency $p$ and the recessive (disease) allele be denoted by $a$ with frequency $q$. In the population, the allele frequencies are related by the equation $p + q = 1$. The disease is autosomal recessive, meaning that affected individuals have the genotype $aa$.\n\n**1. Carrier Frequency under Random Mating**\n\nUnder the assumption of a large, randomly mating population in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of the three possible genotypes ($AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$) are given by $p^2$, $2pq$, and $q^2$, respectively. Individuals who are heterozygous ($Aa$) are carriers of the recessive allele but are phenotypically unaffected. The frequency of these carriers is therefore $2pq$.\n\nThe problem provides the prevalence of affected individuals, which is the frequency of the $aa$ genotype:\n$$q^2 = \\frac{1}{10{,}000} = 0.0001$$\nFrom this, we can determine the frequency of the recessive allele, $q$:\n$$q = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{10{,}000}} = \\frac{1}{100} = 0.01$$\nThe frequency of the dominant allele, $p$, can then be calculated:\n$$p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$$\nThe general expression for the carrier frequency under random mating is $2pq$. We can now compute its value for the given prevalence:\n$$\\text{Carrier Frequency} = 2pq = 2 \\times 0.99 \\times 0.01 = 0.0198$$\nRounding this to $4$ significant figures gives $0.01980$.\n\n**2. Disease Incidence with Consanguinity ($F = \\frac{1}{16}$)**\n\nThe inbreeding coefficient, $F$, quantifies the probability that two alleles at a locus in an individual are identical by descent (IBD). For a locus with a recessive allele $a$ at frequency $q$, the frequency of homozygous recessive individuals ($aa$) in a population with inbreeding coefficient $F$ is given by the sum of two probabilities:\n1. The two alleles are IBD, which occurs with probability $F$. For the individual to be of genotype $aa$, the ancestral allele must have been $a$, which has a population frequency of $q$. Thus, this component of the probability is $Fq$.\n2. The two alleles are not IBD (i.e., they are independent draws from the gene pool), which occurs with probability $1-F$. The probability of drawing two $a$ alleles independently is $q^2$. Thus, this component of the probability is $(1-F)q^2$.\n\nThe general expression for the total incidence of the disease under inbreeding is the sum of these two components:\n$$\\text{Incidence}(aa) = Fq + (1-F)q^2$$\nThis expression can be algebraically rearranged:\n$$\\text{Incidence}(aa) = q^2 + F(q-q^2) = q^2 + Fq(1-q) = q^2 + Fpq$$\nFor offspring of first-cousin unions, the inbreeding coefficient is $F = \\frac{1}{16} = 0.0625$. Using the allele frequencies $p=0.99$ and $q=0.01$, we compute the disease incidence:\n$$\\text{Incidence}(aa) = (0.01)^2 + (0.0625)(0.99)(0.01)$$\n$$\\text{Incidence}(aa) = 0.0001 + (0.0625)(0.0099) = 0.0001 + 0.00061875 = 0.00071875$$\nRounding this to $4$ significant figures gives $0.0007188$.\n\n**3. Fold-Change in Incidence**\n\nThe fold-change is the ratio of the disease incidence in the presence of consanguinity to the incidence under Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (random mating).\n$$\\text{Fold-Change} = \\frac{\\text{Incidence with inbreeding}}{\\text{Incidence under random mating}} = \\frac{q^2 + Fpq}{q^2}$$\nThis expression simplifies to:\n$$\\text{Fold-Change} = 1 + \\frac{Fpq}{q^2} = 1 + \\frac{Fp}{q}$$\nUsing the values $F = 0.0625$, $p = 0.99$, and $q = 0.01$:\n$$\\text{Fold-Change} = 1 + \\frac{0.0625 \\times 0.99}{0.01} = 1 + \\frac{0.061875}{0.01} = 1 + 6.1875 = 7.1875$$\nAlternatively, using the calculated incidence values:\n$$\\text{Fold-Change} = \\frac{0.00071875}{0.0001} = 7.1875$$\nRounding this result to $4$ significant figures gives $7.188$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.01980  0.0007188  7.188\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4665692"}, {"introduction": "Early diagnosis is critical for life-threatening PIDs like Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID).
