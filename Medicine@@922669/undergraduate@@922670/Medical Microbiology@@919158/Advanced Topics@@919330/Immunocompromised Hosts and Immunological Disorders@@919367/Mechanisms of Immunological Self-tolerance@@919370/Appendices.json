This can be understood as the overall probability of a randomly selected autoreactive T cell being eliminated.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the problem. Let $E$ be the event that a randomly chosen autoreactive T cell is eliminated. The population of autoreactive T cells is partitioned into $5$ mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories. Let $C_i$ be the event that a T cell belongs to category $i$, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\n\nThe problem provides the frequencies $\\{f_i\\}$ of these categories. The frequency $f_i$ is the probability that a randomly selected autoreactive T cell belongs to category $i$. Thus, we have:\n$P(C_i) = f_i$\n\nThe problem also provides the probabilities $\\{p_i\\}$, where $p_i$ is the probability that a T cell from category $i$ is eliminated. This is a conditional probability: the probability of elimination $E$ given that the cell belongs to category $C_i$. We can write this as:\n$P(E | C_i) = p_i$\n\nThe categories $\\{C_i\\}$ are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, which means they form a partition of the sample space of autoreactive T cells. Therefore, we can apply the law of total probability to find the overall probability of elimination, $P(E)$. The law states:\n$$P(E) = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} P(E|C_i) P(C_i)$$\n\nSubstituting the given notation, the formula becomes:\n$$P(E) = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} p_i f_i$$\n\nThis probability, $P(E)$, represents the fraction of the total population of autoreactive T cells that is expected to be eliminated. To see this, consider an indicator random variable $X$ for a single cell, where $X=1$ if the cell is eliminated and $X=0$ otherwise. The expectation of $X$ is $E[X] = 1 \\cdot P(X=1) + 0 \\cdot P(X=0) = P(E)$. For a large population, the expected fraction of eliminated cells is equal to this probability.\n\nThe given data are:\nFor category $1$ (Ubiquitous): $f_1 = 0.22$, $p_1 = 0.95$\nFor category $2$ (AIRE-dependent TRA): $f_2 = 0.38$, $p_2 = 0.65$\nFor category $3$ (AIRE-independent TRA): $f_3 = 0.12$, $p_3 = 0.30$\nFor category $4$ (Post-translationally modified): $f_4 = 0.18$, $p_4 = 0.15$\nFor category $5$ (Peripheral-only): $f_5 = 0.10$, $p_5 = 0.05$\n\nWe can now compute the sum of the products $p_i f_i$:\n$$P(E) = f_1 p_1 + f_2 p_2 + f_3 p_3 + f_4 p_4 + f_5 p_5$$\n$$P(E) = (0.22)(0.95) + (0.38)(0.65) + (0.12)(0.30) + (0.18)(0.15) + (0.10)(0.05)$$\n\nLet's calculate each term individually:\nThe contribution from category $1$ is $0.22 \\times 0.95 = 0.209$.\nThe contribution from category $2$ is $0.38 \\times 0.65 = 0.247$.\nThe contribution from category $3$ is $0.12 \\times 0.30 = 0.036$.\nThe contribution from category $4$ is $0.18 \\times 0.15 = 0.027$.\nThe contribution from category $5$ is $0.10 \\times 0.05 = 0.005$.\n\nNow, we sum these contributions to find the total probability:\n$$P(E) = 0.209 + 0.247 + 0.036 + 0.027 + 0.005$$\n$$P(E) = 0.524$$\n\nThis value represents the expected fraction of autoreactive T cells eliminated by negative selection. The problem asks for the answer as a single decimal number rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $0.524$ already has exactly three significant figures ($5$, $2$, and $4$).
