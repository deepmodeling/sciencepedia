Consider the early-phase pathogen population, where the pathogen burden, denoted by $B(t)$, changes according to a per-capita replication rate $r$ and a per-capita immune clearance rate $c$. In this early phase, assume that $r$ and $c$ are constants over the timescale of interest and that the infection expands when $rc$. In neutropenic hosts, innate clearance is dominated by neutrophils; assume the clearance rate is proportional to the Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC), so that $c \\propto \\text{ANC}$.

This is a common and valid simplification in population dynamics and mathematical epidemiology. The parameters are physically realistic, and their units are consistent. The relation $c = k \\cdot \\text{ANC}$ implies that the rate of clearance of pathogens is proportional to the concentration of neutrophils, which is a plausible assumption for a first-order model of innate immune response. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary information provided to derive the requested quantities. It is objective and free of any speculative or non-scientific claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe dynamics of the pathogen population, $B(t)$, can be described by a differential equation. The rate of change of the population, $\\frac{dB}{dt}$, is the difference between the total rate of replication and the total rate of clearance.\nThe total replication rate is the per-capita rate $r$ multiplied by the population size $B(t)$, which is $rB(t)$.\nThe total clearance rate is the per-capita rate $c$ multiplied by the population size $B(t)$, which is $cB(t)$.\nTherefore, the differential equation governing the pathogen burden is:\n$$\n\\frac{dB(t)}{dt} = rB(t) - cB(t) = (r - c)B(t)\n$$\nThis is the fundamental threshold model. The sign of the net growth rate, $(r-c)$, determines the fate of the infection.\n- If $r - c  0$, or $r  c$, then $\\frac{dB}{dt}  0$ (assuming $B0$), and the infection expands.\n- If $r - c  0$, or $r  c$, then $\\frac{dB}{dt}  0$, and the infection contracts.\n- If $r - c = 0$, or $r = c$, then $\\frac{dB}{dt} = 0$, and the pathogen burden remains constant. This is the critical threshold condition where the infection neither expands nor contracts.\n\nThe problem states that the per-capita clearance rate $c$ is a function of the Absolute Neutrophil Count, $\\text{ANC}$, given by the expression:\n$$\nc = k \\cdot \\text{ANC}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nThe critical Absolute Neutrophil Count, denoted $\\text{ANC}^{\\ast}$, is the value of $\\text{ANC}$ for which the system is at the threshold, i.e., $r = c$. We can find the expression for $\\text{ANC}^{\\ast}$ by substituting the relationship for $c$ into the threshold condition:\n$$\nr = k \\cdot \\text{ANC}^{\\ast}\n$$\nSolving this equation for $\\text{ANC}^{\\ast}$ yields the general expression for the critical neutrophil count:\n$$\n\\text{ANC}^{\\ast} = \\frac{r}{k}\n$$\nThis expression defines the minimum neutrophil count required to control the infection (i.e., prevent its net growth).\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\text{ANC}^{\\ast}$ using the provided parameters:\n- $r = 0.20\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$\n- $k = 4.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{day}^{-1}\\,(\\text{cells}/\\mu\\text{L})^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\n\\text{ANC}^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.20\\,\\text{day}^{-1}}{4.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{day}^{-1}\\,(\\text{cells}/\\mu\\text{L})^{-1}}\n$$\nThe units of $\\text{day}^{-1}$ in the numerator and denominator cancel. The unit of $(\\text{cells}/\\mu\\text{L})^{-1}$ in the denominator becomes $\\text{cells}/\\mu\\text{L}$ in the final result, which is the correct unit for a cell concentration.\nPerforming the arithmetic:\n$$\n\\text{ANC}^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.20}{4.0 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-1}}{4.0 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{2.0}{4.0} \\times 10^{-1 - (-4)} = 0.5 \\times 10^{3} = 500\n$$\nThe numerical value is exact, so no rounding is necessary.

The positive likelihood ratio for the test, $LR_{+} = 7$.\n\nOur goal is to calculate the posttest probability of the disease given a positive test result, which is denoted as $P(D|T^+)$.\n\nWe begin by relating probability to odds. The odds of an event $A$ are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(A) = \\frac{P(A)}{1 - P(A)} $$\nUsing this definition, we can calculate the pretest odds of invasive aspergillosis:\n$$ \\text{Pretest Odds} = \\text{Odds}(D) = \\frac{P(D)}{1 - P(D)} = \\frac{0.20}{1 - 0.20} = \\frac{0.20}{0.80} = 0.25 $$\n\nThe likelihood ratio of a positive test, $LR_{+}$, is defined as the ratio of the probability of a positive test in a patient with the disease (sensitivity) to the probability of a positive test in a patient without the disease ($1-$specificity).\n$$ LR_{+} = \\frac{P(T^+|D)}{P(T^+|D^c)} $$\nwhere $D^c$ is the event that the patient does not have the disease.\n\nThe relationship between pretest odds, posttest odds, and the likelihood ratio is derived from Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:\n$$ P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} $$\nSimilarly, for the complementary event $D^c$:\n$$ P(D^c|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^+)} $$\nThe posttest odds are the ratio of these two posterior probabilities:\n$$ \\text{Posttest Odds} = \\frac{P(D|T^+)}{P(D^c|T^+)} = \\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D) / P(T^+)}{P(T^+|D^c) P(D^c) / P(T^+)} $$\nThe term $P(T^+)$ cancels, yielding:\n$$ \\text{Posttest Odds} = \\frac{P(T^+|D)}{P(T^+|D^c)} \\times \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)} $$\nRecognizing the terms on the right-hand side, we arrive at the odds form of Bayes' theorem:\n$$ \\text{Posttest Odds} = LR_{+} \\times \\text{Pretest Odds} $$\nWe are given $LR_{+} = 7$ and we calculated the pretest odds to be $0.25$.

In the context of a life-threatening infection in an immunocompromised host, a posterior probability of this magnitude typically crosses the \"treatment threshold.\" It provides strong evidence to justify the initiation of empiric antifungal therapy (e.g., with a mold-active azole like voriconazole) immediately, rather than waiting for more definitive, and often invasive, diagnostic procedures like a lung biopsy.
