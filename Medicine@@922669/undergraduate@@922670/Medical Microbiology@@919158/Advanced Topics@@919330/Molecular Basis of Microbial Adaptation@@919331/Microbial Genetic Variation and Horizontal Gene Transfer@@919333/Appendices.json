Under the Luria–Delbrück framework and the Lea–Coulson approximation (deterministic exponential growth for both wild-type and mutant lineages and mutation occurring stochastically at divisions), derive from first principles expressions for the expected number of resistant cells and the variance of the number of resistant cells at the time the population reaches size $N$.
