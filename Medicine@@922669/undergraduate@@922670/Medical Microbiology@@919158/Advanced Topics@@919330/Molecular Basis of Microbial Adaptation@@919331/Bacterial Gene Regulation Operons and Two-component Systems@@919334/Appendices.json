It provides a clear, self-contained description of a standard model in molecular biophysics and asks for a rigorous derivation based on its premises.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested. First, we derive the expression for the repression fold, $RF$. Second, we calculate the change in $RF$ when the repressor concentration is doubled.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Repression Fold ($RF$)**\n\nThe problem defines the system by the reversible binding reaction between a single operator site, $O$, and a repressor protein, $R$ (LacI), to form a complex, $OR$:\n$$O + R \\rightleftharpoons OR$$\nThis reaction is assumed to be at equilibrium. The equilibrium association constant, denoted as $K_{R}$ in the problem statement, is given by the law of mass action:\n$$K_{R} = \\frac{[OR]}{[O][R]}$$\nwhere $[O]$ is the concentration of free operator sites, $[R]$ is the concentration of free repressor proteins, and $[OR]$ is the concentration of operator-repressor complexes.\n\nThe operator can exist in only two states: free ($O$) or bound by a repressor ($OR$). The fraction of time the operator is in a particular state is equivalent to the probability of finding the operator in that state at any given moment, assuming ergodicity. Let $P_{free}$ be the probability that the operator is free and $P_{bound}$ be the probability that it is bound. The sum of these probabilities must be $1$:\n$$P_{free} + P_{bound} = 1$$\nThe ratio of these probabilities is proportional to the ratio of the concentrations of the corresponding species:\n$$\\frac{P_{bound}}{P_{free}} = \\frac{[OR]}{[O]}$$\nFrom the definition of the association constant $K_{R}$, we can express the ratio $\\frac{[OR]}{[O]}$ as:\n$$\\frac{[OR]}{[O]} = K_{R} [R]$$\nTherefore, the ratio of probabilities can be written in terms of the repressor concentration $[R]$ and the association constant $K_{R}$:\n$$\\frac{P_{bound}}{P_{free}} = K_{R} [R]$$\nThis allows us to express $P_{bound}$ in terms of $P_{free}$:\n$$P_{bound} = P_{free} \\cdot K_{R} [R]$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $P_{bound}$ back into the probability conservation equation:\n$$P_{free} + (P_{free} \\cdot K_{R} [R]) = 1$$\nFactoring out $P_{free}$:\n$$P_{free} (1 + K_{R} [R]) = 1$$\nSolving for $P_{free}$ gives:\n$$P_{free} = \\frac{1}{1 + K_{R} [R]}$$\nThe problem defines the repression fold, $RF$, as the \"normalized transcriptional output, equal to the fraction of time the operator is free.\" This corresponds directly to $P_{free}$. Thus, the expression for $RF$ is:\n$$RF = \\frac{1}{1 + K_{R} [R]}$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculating the Change in Repression Fold**\n\nWe are asked to compute the ratio of the new repression fold to the original one when the repressor concentration, $[R]$, is doubled.\nLet the original repression fold be $RF_{original}$. Based on our derivation:\n$$RF_{original} = \\frac{1}{1 + K_{R} [R]}$$\nThe problem states that due to a doubling of the *lacI* gene copy number, the new steady-state repressor concentration, $[R]_{new}$, is twice the original concentration:\n$$[R]_{new} = 2 [R]$$\nThe new repression fold, $RF_{new}$, is calculated using the same formula with the new concentration:\n$$RF_{new} = \\frac{1}{1 + K_{R} [R]_{new}} = \\frac{1}{1 + K_{R} (2[R])} = \\frac{1}{1 + 2 K_{R} [R]}$$\nThe required quantity is the ratio of the new repression fold to the original repression fold, $\\frac{RF_{new}}{RF_{original}}$:\n$$\\frac{RF_{new}}{RF_{original}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{1 + 2 K_{R} [R]}}{\\frac{1}{1 + K_{R} [R]}}$$\nSimplifying this complex fraction yields the final expression:\n$$\\frac{RF_{new}}{RF_{original}} = \\frac{1 + K_{R} [R]}{1 + 2 K_{R} [R]}$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the change in repression fold in terms of the initial repressor concentration $[R]$ and the association constant $K_{R}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1 + K_{R} [R]}{1 + 2 K_{R} [R]}}$$", "id": "4609653"}, {"introduction": "A genetic switch is not only defined by its 'on' and 'off' states, but also by how effectively it transitions between them.

The fold-change is defined as the ratio of the mutant resistance to the wild-type resistance.\nLet $Resistance_{mutant}$ be the resistance of the mutant strain and $Resistance_{WT}$ be the resistance of the wild-type strain.\nThe fold-change is given by the ratio:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{Resistance_{mutant}}{Resistance_{WT}}\n$$\nWe are given that the polymyxin resistance metric is proportional to the steady-state expression level of the target operon, $E(R)$. Let $c$ be the constant of proportionality, where $c > 0$.\n$$\nResistance = c \\cdot E(R)\n$$\nTherefore, the fold-change can be expressed as a ratio of the expression levels:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{c \\cdot E(R_{mutant})}{c \\cdot E(R_{WT})} = \\frac{E(R_{mutant})}{E(R_{WT})}\n$$\nwhere $R_{WT}$ and $R_{mutant}$ are the concentrations of phosphorylated PmrA in the wild-type and mutant strains, respectively.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n- Wild-type concentration: $R_{WT} = R_{0}$\n- Mutant concentration: $R_{mutant} = 3R_{0}$\n\nThe expression level $E(R)$ is given by the Hill function:\n$$\nE(R) = \\frac{R^{n}}{K_{d}^{n} + R^{n}}\n$$\nWe can now calculate the expression level for the wild-type and mutant strains.\nFor the wild-type strain, with $R = R_{0}$:\n$$\nE(R_{WT}) = E(R_{0}) = \\frac{R_{0}^{n}}{K_{d}^{n} + R_{0}^{n}}\n$$\nFor the mutant strain, with $R = 3R_{0}$:\n$$\nE(R_{mutant}) = E(3R_{0}) = \\frac{(3R_{0})^{n}}{K_{d}^{n} + (3R_{0})^{n}} = \\frac{3^{n}R_{0}^{n}}{K_{d}^{n} + 3^{n}R_{0}^{n}}\n$$\nNow, we compute the ratio to find the fold-change:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{E(3R_{0})}{E(R_{0})} = \\frac{\\dfrac{3^{n}R_{0}^{n}}{K_{d}^{n} + 3^{n}R_{0}^{n}}}{\\dfrac{R_{0}^{n}}{K_{d}^{n} + R_{0}^{n}}}\n$$\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply by the reciprocal of the denominator:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{3^{n}R_{0}^{n}}{K_{d}^{n} + 3^{n}R_{0}^{n}} \\times \\frac{K_{d}^{n} + R_{0}^{n}}{R_{0}^{n}}\n$$\nThe term $R_{0}^{n}$ cancels out from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = 3^{n} \\left( \\frac{K_{d}^{n} + R_{0}^{n}}{K_{d}^{n} + 3^{n}R_{0}^{n}} \\right)\n$$\nThe final expression must be in terms of $n$ and the dimensionless ratio $r = \\dfrac{R_{0}}{K_{d}}$. To achieve this, we divide both the numerator and the denominator of the fractional part by $K_{d}^{n}$:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = 3^{n} \\left( \\frac{\\dfrac{K_{d}^{n}}{K_{d}^{n}} + \\dfrac{R_{0}^{n}}{K_{d}^{n}}}{\\dfrac{K_{d}^{n}}{K_{d}^{n}} + \\dfrac{3^{n}R_{0}^{n}}{K_{d}^{n}}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = 3^{n} \\left( \\frac{1 + \\left(\\dfrac{R_{0}}{K_{d}}\\right)^{n}}{1 + 3^{n}\\left(\\dfrac{R_{0}}{K_{d}}\\right)^{n}} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $r = \\dfrac{R_{0}}{K_{d}}$, we obtain the final simplified expression for the fold-change in resistance:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = 3^{n} \\left( \\frac{1 + r^{n}}{1 + 3^{n}r^{n}} \\right)\n$$\nThis expression is dimensionless and given solely in terms of the required parameters $n$ and $r$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3^{n} \\frac{1 + r^{n}}{1 + 3^{n}r^{n}}}\n$$", "id": "4609614"}]}
