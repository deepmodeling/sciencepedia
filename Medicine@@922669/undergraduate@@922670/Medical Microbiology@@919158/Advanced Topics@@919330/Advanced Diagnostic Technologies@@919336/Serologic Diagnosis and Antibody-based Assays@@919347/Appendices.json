A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires a qualitative analysis of the infection stage at each time point and a quantitative calculation of the seroconversion time.\n\n**Qualitative Analysis of Infection Stage**\n\nWe use the provided LOD ($A_{\\text{LOD}} = 0.050\\,\\text{AU}$) and LOQ ($A_{\\text{LOQ}} = 0.100\\,\\text{AU}$) to classify the signals. An antibody test is considered negative if the signal is below the LOD, detectable but indeterminate if between LOD and LOQ, and positive if above the LOQ.\n\n-   **At day $7$**:\n    -   IgM: $A_{\\text{IgM}}(7) = 0.310\\,\\text{AU} > A_{\\text{LOQ}}$.

The IgM signal remains positive, though it has started to decline.\n    -   IgG: $A_{\\text{IgG}}(14) = 0.085\\,\\text{AU}$. This value is between the LOD and LOQ ($A_{\\text{LOD}} \\le 0.085  A_{\\text{LOQ}}$). The IgG antibody is detectable, but not yet at a level considered \"seropositive\" by the laboratory's conservative definition.\n    -   **Classification**: Positive IgM with a rising, newly detectable IgG is characteristic of an ongoing **acute infection**.

The test output is an optical density (OD), and a patient is considered positive if the OD is at least a chosen cutoff $c$. Across a prospective cohort with known infection status, the laboratory has estimated sensitivity and specificity at several OD cutoffs under stable preanalytical conditions. Let sensitivity be the true positive rate (TPR), and specificity be the true negative rate; the false positive rate (FPR) is defined by $ \\text{FPR} = 1 - \\text{specificity} $.

It represents a standard and fundamental analysis in the evaluation of diagnostic tests in medicine and biostatistics. The concepts and definitions provided are standard and correctly stated. The data is internally consistent; as the cutoff $c$ increases, sensitivity decreases and specificity increases, which is the expected behavior. The instructions are clear and lead to a unique, verifiable solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and the solution proceeds.\n\nThe first step is to transform the given performance data from $(\\text{sensitivity}, \\text{specificity})$ pairs into $(\\text{FPR}, \\text{TPR})$ coordinates for the ROC curve. The problem defines $\\text{TPR} = \\text{sensitivity}$ and $\\text{FPR} = 1 - \\text{specificity}$.\n\nThe given data points are:\n1.  At $c = 0.20$: sensitivity $= 0.98$, specificity $= 0.42$. This yields the ROC point $(\\text{FPR}, \\text{TPR}) = (1 - 0.42, 0.98) = (0.58, 0.98)$.\n2.  At $c = 0.35$: sensitivity $= 0.94$, specificity $= 0.58$.

Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\Pr(D^c \\mid T^-) = \\frac{\\Pr(T^- \\mid D^c) \\Pr(D^c)}{\\Pr(T^-)} $$\nUsing the law of total probability for the denominator:\n$$ \\Pr(T^-) = \\Pr(T^- \\mid D^c) \\Pr(D^c) + \\Pr(T^- \\mid D) \\Pr(D) $$\nSubstituting the standard terms:\n$$ \\Pr(T^-) = (Sp)(1 - P) + (1 - Se)(P) $$\nTherefore, the formula for NPV is:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{Sp \\cdot (1 - P)}{Sp \\cdot (1 - P) + (1 - Se) \\cdot P} $$\n\n### Calculations\nWe will now calculate the PPV and NPV for each assay at each given prevalence, rounding to four significant figures.\n\n**Assay A:** $Se_A = 0.93$, $Sp_A = 0.98$\n\n1.  **Prevalence $P = 0.01$:**\n    $$ \\text{PPV}_A(0.01) = \\frac{0.93 \\cdot 0.01}{0.93 \\cdot 0.01 + (1 - 0.98)(1 - 0.01)} = \\frac{0.0093}{0.0093 + (0.02)(0.99)} = \\frac{0.0093}{0.0291} \\approx 0.319587... \\approx 0.3196 $$\n    $$ \\text{NPV}_A(0.01) = \\frac{0.98 \\cdot (1 - 0.01)}{0.98 \\cdot (1 - 0.01) + (1 - 0.93)(0.01)} = \\frac{0.98 \\cdot 0.99}{0.9702 + (0.07)(0.01)} = \\frac{0.9702}{0.9709} \\approx 0.999279... \\approx 0.9993 $$\n\n2.  **Prevalence $P = 0.05$:**\n    $$ \\text{PPV}_A(0.05) = \\frac{0.93 \\cdot 0.05}{0.93 \\cdot 0.05 + (1 - 0.98)(1 - 0.05)} = \\frac{0.0465}{0.0465 + (0.02)(0.95)} = \\frac{0.0465}{0.0655} \\approx 0.709923... \\approx 0.7099 $$\n    $$ \\text{NPV}_A(0.05) = \\frac{0.98 \\cdot (1 - 0.05)}{0.98 \\cdot (1 - 0.05) + (1 - 0.93)(0.05)} = \\frac{0.98 \\cdot 0.95}{0.931 + (0.07)(0.05)} = \\frac{0.931}{0.9345} \\approx 0.996254... \\approx 0.9963 $$\n\n3.  **Prevalence $P = 0.20$:**\n    $$ \\text{PPV}_A(0.20) = \\frac{0.93 \\cdot 0.20}{0.93 \\cdot 0.20 + (1 - 0.98)(1 - 0.20)} = \\frac{0.186}{0.186 + (0.02)(0.80)} = \\frac{0.186}{0.202} \\approx 0.920792... \\approx 0.9208 $$\n    $$ \\text{NPV}_A(0.20) = \\frac{0.98 \\cdot (1 - 0.20)}{0.98 \\cdot (1 - 0.20) + (1 - 0.93)(0.20)} = \\frac{0.98 \\cdot 0.80}{0.784 + (0.07)(0.20)} = \\frac{0.784}{0.798} \\approx 0.982456... \\approx 0.9825 $$\n\n**Assay B:** $Se_B = 0.85$, $Sp_B = 0.995$\n\n1.  **Prevalence $P = 0.01$:**\n    $$ \\text{PPV}_B(0.01) = \\frac{0.85 \\cdot 0.01}{0.85 \\cdot 0.01 + (1 - 0.995)(1 - 0.01)} = \\frac{0.0085}{0.0085 + (0.005)(0.99)} = \\frac{0.0085}{0.01345} \\approx 0.631970... \\approx 0.6320 $$\n    $$ \\text{NPV}_B(0.01) = \\frac{0.995 \\cdot (1 - 0.01)}{0.995 \\cdot (1 - 0.01) + (1 - 0.85)(0.01)} = \\frac{0.995 \\cdot 0.99}{0.98505 + (0.15)(0.01)} = \\frac{0.98505}{0.98655} \\approx 0.998479... \\approx 0.9985 $$\n\n2.  **Prevalence $P = 0.05$:**\n    $$ \\text{PPV}_B(0.05) = \\frac{0.85 \\cdot 0.05}{0.85 \\cdot 0.05 + (1 - 0.995)(1 - 0.05)} = \\frac{0.0425}{0.0425 + (0.005)(0.95)} = \\frac{0.0425}{0.04725} \\approx 0.899470... \\approx 0.8995 $$\n    $$ \\text{NPV}_B(0.05) = \\frac{0.995 \\cdot (1 - 0.05)}{0.995 \\cdot (1 - 0.05) + (1 - 0.85)(0.05)} = \\frac{0.995 \\cdot 0.95}{0.94525 + (0.15)(0.05)} = \\frac{0.94525}{0.95275} \\approx 0.992127... \\approx 0.9921 $$\n\n3.  **Prevalence $P = 0.20$:**\n    $$ \\text{PPV}_B(0.20) = \\frac{0.85 \\cdot 0.20}{0.85 \\cdot 0.20 + (1 - 0.995)(1 - 0.20)} = \\frac{0.17}{0.17 + (0.005)(0.80)} = \\frac{0.17}{0.174} \\approx 0.977011... \\approx 0.9770 $$\n    $$ \\text{NPV}_B(0.20) = \\frac{0.995 \\cdot (1 - 0.20)}{0.995 \\cdot (1 - 0.20) + (1 - 0.85)(0.20)} = \\frac{0.995 \\cdot 0.80}{0.796 + (0.15)(0.20)} = \\frac{0.796}{0.826} \\approx 0.963680... \\approx 0.9637 $$\n\n### Qualitative Interpretation\nThe calculated values demonstrate several critical principles of diagnostic testing.\n\n1.  **Impact of Prevalence on PPV:** The positive predictive value (PPV) is highly dependent on the prevalence of the condition in the tested population. For both assays, the PPV is substantially lower in the low-prevalence setting ($P=0.01$) compared to the high-prevalence setting ($P=0.20$). For Assay A, the PPV increases from a clinically poor $0.3196$ to a very strong $0.9208$ as prevalence rises. This illustrates that a positive test result is much less reliable in a low-prevalence (e.g., general population screening) context due to the higher proportion of false positives to true positives.\n\n2.  **Impact of Specificity on PPV:** Specificity is a dominant factor for PPV, especially in low-prevalence settings. Assay B has a lower sensitivity ($0.85$) but a much higher specificity ($0.995$) than Assay A ($Se=0.93$, $Sp=0.98$). At $P=0.01$, Assay B's PPV ($0.6320$) is nearly double that of Assay A ($0.3196$). This is because Assay B's extremely high specificity generates very few false positives, which are the primary reason for low PPV when the disease is rare. This makes Assay B superior for confirming a diagnosis, especially when prevalence is low.\n\n3.  **Impact of Sensitivity on NPV:** The negative predictive value (NPV) is strongly influenced by sensitivity and is less affected by prevalence than PPV. Both assays maintain a very high NPV across all prevalence settings, meaning a negative result is highly reliable for ruling out prior infection. Assay A, with its higher sensitivity ($0.93$), consistently produces a slightly higher NPV than Assay B ($Se=0.85$). This is because high sensitivity minimizes false negatives. For example, at $P=0.20$, Assay A's NPV is $0.9825$ while Assay B's is $0.9637$. This makes Assay A marginally better for ruling out disease.\n\n**Clinical Relevance Summary:** In low-prevalence settings, a positive result, particularly from Assay A, has a low probability of being a true positive and should be confirmed, preferably with a high-specificity test. Assay B is better for \"ruling in\" a diagnosis in this setting. Conversely, a negative result from either test is highly reliable for \"ruling out\" a diagnosis, with Assay A being slightly more robust due to its higher sensitivity. In high-prevalence settings, a positive test from either assay is very likely to be a true positive, making both assays effective for confirming infection.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0.3196  0.9993  0.7099  0.9963  0.9208  0.9825  0.6320  0.9985  0.8995  0.9921  0.9770  0.9637 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4676233"}]}
