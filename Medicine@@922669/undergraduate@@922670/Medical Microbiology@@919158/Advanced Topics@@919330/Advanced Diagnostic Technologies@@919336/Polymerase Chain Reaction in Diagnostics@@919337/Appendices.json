The standard curve is a plot of $C_q$ (on the y-axis) versus $\\log_{10}(N_0)$ (on the x-axis). To find the slope of this line, we must first express $C_q$ as a function of $\\log_{10}(N_0)$.\n\nWe begin by taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\ln(N_T) = \\ln(N_0 (1+E)^{C_q}) $$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can expand the right side:\n$$ \\ln(N_T) = \\ln(N_0) + \\ln((1+E)^{C_q}) $$\n$$ \\ln(N_T) = \\ln(N_0) + C_q \\ln(1+E) $$\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for $C_q$:\n$$ C_q \\ln(1+E) = \\ln(N_T) - \\ln(N_0) $$\n$$ C_q = \\frac{\\ln(N_T)}{\\ln(1+E)} - \\frac{\\ln(N_0)}{\\ln(1+E)} $$\nThis expression gives $C_q$ as a function of $\\ln(N_0)$.

We must apply the change of base formula for logarithms, which states that $\\log_b(x) = \\frac{\\log_a(x)}{\\log_a(b)}$. In our case, we want to convert from the natural logarithm (base $e$) to the base-$10$ logarithm:\n$$ \\ln(N_0) = \\frac{\\log_{10}(N_0)}{\\log_{10}(e)} = \\ln(10) \\cdot \\log_{10}(N_0) $$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $C_q$:\n$$ C_q = \\frac{\\ln(N_T)}{\\ln(1+E)} - \\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\ln(1+E)} \\log_{10}(N_0) $$\nThis equation is in the form of a straight line, $y = mx + b$, where:\n- The dependent variable is $y = C_q$.\n- The independent variable is $x = \\log_{10}(N_0)$.\n- The y-intercept is $b = \\frac{\\ln(N_T)}{\\ln(1+E)}$.\n- The slope is $m = s = -\\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\ln(1+E)}$.\n\nThe problem defines $s$ as the slope of this line. We have thus found the relationship between the slope $s$ and the efficiency $E$:\n$$ s = -\\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\ln(1+E)} $$\nThe next step is to derive a closed-form expression for $E$ in terms of $s$. We rearrange the equation to isolate $\\ln(1+E)$:\n$$ \\ln(1+E) = -\\frac{\\ln(10)}{s} $$\nTo solve for $E$, we exponentiate both sides of the equation with base $e$:\n$$ \\exp(\\ln(1+E)) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(10)}{s}\\right) $$\n$$ 1+E = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(10)}{s}\\right) $$\nUsing the identity $\\exp(a \\ln b) = b^a$, we can rewrite the right-hand side:\n$$ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{s} \\ln(10)\\right) = 10^{-1/s} $$\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$$ 1+E = 10^{-1/s} $$\nFinally, we solve for $E$:\n$$ E = 10^{-1/s} - 1 $$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the amplification efficiency $E$ in terms of the slope $s$.\n\nThe second part of the task is to compute the value of $E$ for an experimentally measured slope of $s = -3.32$. We substitute this value into our derived expression:\n$$ E = 10^{-1/(-3.32)} - 1 $$\n$$ E = 10^{1/3.32} - 1 $$\nWe now compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\frac{1}{3.32} \\approx 0.30120481927... $$\n$$ E = 10^{0.30120481927...} - 1 $$\n$$ E \\approx 2.00084360... - 1 $$\n$$ E \\approx 1.00084360... $$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.

Intron-Spanning Assay**\n- **RT-containing reaction (+RT):** The primary template is cDNA, derived from mRNA. The initial copy number is $N_0 \\approx 10^5$. The amplicon size is ~$150$ bp. This reaction is expected to amplify efficiently and produce a $C_q$ value.\n- **No-RT control (-RT):** Without Reverse Transcriptase, cDNA cannot be synthesized. The only available template is the contaminating gDNA, with an initial copy number of $N_0 \\approx 10^2$. However, the primers are separated by a large intron, resulting in an implied amplicon size of ~$10{,}000$ bp. Standard qPCR protocols use very short extension times (e.g., $15-60$ seconds) that are insufficient for the DNA polymerase to synthesize a fragment of this length. Therefore, amplification will be negligible or fail completely. The fluorescence signal will not cross the threshold within the $40$ cycles. The result will be \"undetected\" (i.e., $C_q > 40$).\n\n**2. Intronless Assay**\n- **RT-containing reaction (+RT):** Templates include both cDNA (from RNA) and gDNA (contaminant). The total initial copy number is the sum: $N_{0, +RT} = N_{cDNA} + N_{gDNA} \\approx 10^5 + 10^2$. Since $10^5 \\gg 10^2$, the total is approximately $10^5$. The amplicon size is ~$150$ bp, which will amplify efficiently.\n- **No-RT control (-RT):** The only available template is gDNA. The initial copy number is $N_{0, -RT} \\approx 10^2$. The amplicon size is ~$150$ bp, which will also amplify efficiently.\n- **Comparison of $C_q$ values:** The \"no-RT\" reaction starts with a significantly lower copy number than the \"+RT\" reaction. The expected difference in $C_q$ is:\n$$\\Delta C_q = C_{q, -RT} - C_{q, +RT} = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{N_{0, +RT}}{N_{0, -RT}}\\right) \\approx \\log_2\\left(\\frac{10^5}{10^2}\\right) = \\log_2(10^3)$$\nUsing the approximation $\\log_2(1000) \\approx 10$, or more precisely, $\\log_2(1000) = \\frac{\\ln(1000)}{\\ln(2)} \\approx \\frac{6.9077}{0.6931} \\approx 9.966$.\nThus, the $C_q$ of the \"no-RT\" control is expected to be approximately $10$ cycles higher (later) than the $C_q$ of the RT-containing reaction.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For each clinical sample, set up a matched \"no-RT\" well by omitting the Reverse Transcriptase while keeping template, primers, and quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) master mix otherwise identical.

A no-template control (NTC) checks for reagent contamination, not sample-specific gDNA carryover. The claim that \"PCR can bridge introns efficiently\" is factually incorrect for a ~$10{,}000$ bp intron in a standard qPCR protocol. Finally, the intronless assay in a \"no-RT\" reaction would produce a signal from the ~$10^2$ copies of gDNA and would not be \"undetected.\"\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C.

The intron-spanning assay on a gDNA template will not amplify, so it should be undetected, not merely delayed. The intronless assay will have a significantly delayed $C_q$ in the control reaction (by ~$10$ cycles) due to the ~$1000$-fold lower template amount, so the $C_q$ values will not be identical.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. In the \"no-RT\" control, omit Reverse Transcriptase and shorten the extension time to favor small products; predict that the intron-spanning assay will still amplify genomic DNA with a \"no-RT\" $C_q$ similar to RT-containing reactions because introns do not affect primer binding, whereas the intronless assay will be undetected in \"no-RT\" due to lack of cDNA.**\n- **Analysis:** This option is incorrect. Shortening the extension time would further guarantee the failure to amplify the ~$10{,}000$ bp genomic product. The prediction that the intron-spanning assay will amplify gDNA with a similar $C_q$ to the +RT reaction is false; primer binding is insufficient if the polymerase cannot bridge the large distance between them in time.

NPV decreases as prevalence increases.\n- **Incorrect**.\n\nD. \"PPV is the probability of disease given a positive test, and NPV is the probability of no disease given a negative test; for any prevalence, PPV $=0.92$ and NPV $=0.97$ because Bayes’ theorem guarantees equality of PPV with sensitivity and NPV with specificity when the test is calibrated.\"\n- The definitions of PPV and NPV are correct.\n- The claim that PPV equals sensitivity and NPV equals specificity for any prevalence is fundamentally flawed. As demonstrated by our calculations, the predictive values are prevalence-dependent.\n- The justification that Bayes' theorem guarantees this equality is false. Bayes' theorem demonstrates the exact opposite: the dependence on prevalence ($P(D)$). The term \"calibrated\" is vague and does not represent a standard condition for this false equivalence.\n- **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the analysis, option B is the only statement that provides the correct definitions, correct numerical calculations, and a correct conceptual understanding of the relationship between predictive values, test characteristics, and prevalence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4663719"}]}
