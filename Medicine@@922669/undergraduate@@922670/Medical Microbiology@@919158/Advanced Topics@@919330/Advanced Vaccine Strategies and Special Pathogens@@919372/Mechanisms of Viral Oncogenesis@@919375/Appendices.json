A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Fractional Occupancy**\nLet $P$ represent a protein (e.g., p53 or pRb) and $L$ represent its binding ligand (e.g., E6 or E7). For a simple $1{:}1$ reversible binding reaction, the equilibrium is described as:\n$$ P + L \\rightleftharpoons PL $$\nwhere $PL$ is the protein-ligand complex.\n\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the law of mass action at equilibrium:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[P][L]}{[PL]} $$\nwhere $[P]$, $[L]$, and $[PL]$ are the equilibrium concentrations of free protein, free ligand, and the complex, respectively.\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is the fraction of total protein that is bound by the ligand. The total protein concentration, $[P]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the free and bound protein concentrations:\n$$ [P]_{\\text{total}} = [P] + [PL] $$\nFractional occupancy is thus defined as:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[PL]}{[P]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[PL]}{[P] + [PL]} $$\nTo derive the expression in terms of $[L]$ and $K_d$, we first rearrange the $K_d$ expression to solve for $[P]$:\n$$ [P] = \\frac{K_d [PL]}{[L]} $$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[P]$ into the denominator of the fractional occupancy equation:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[PL]}{\\left(\\frac{K_d [PL]}{[L]}\\right) + [PL]} $$\nFactor out $[PL]$ from the denominator:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[PL]}{[PL] \\left(\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1\\right)} $$\nCanceling the $[PL]$ term yields:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d + [L]}{[L]}} $$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for fractional occupancy, often known as the Hill-Langmuir equation for a single binding site:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_d} $$\nThis derivation fulfills the first part of the task. Note that the problem provides the *free* ligand concentration $[L]$, which directly fits into this equation.\n\n**Calculation of Fractional Occupancies**\nThe problem states that the free cytosolic concentrations of E6 and E7 are both $[L] = 40$ nM.\n\n1.  **Fractional Occupancy of p53 by E6 ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{p53}}$)**\n    The relevant parameters are $[L] = 40$ nM and $K_{d,\\mathrm{E6\\text{-}p53}} = 180$ nM.\n    $$ \\theta_{\\mathrm{p53}} = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_{d,\\mathrm{E6\\text{-}p53}}} = \\frac{40 \\, \\text{nM}}{40 \\, \\text{nM} + 180 \\, \\text{nM}} = \\frac{40}{220} = \\frac{2}{11} $$\n\n2.  **Fractional Occupancy of pRb by E7 ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{pRb}}$)**\n    The relevant parameters are $[L] = 40$ nM and $K_{d,\\mathrm{E7\\text{-}pRb}} = 8$ nM.\n    $$ \\theta_{\\mathrm{pRb}} = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_{d,\\mathrm{E7\\text{-}pRb}}} = \\frac{40 \\, \\text{nM}}{40 \\, \\text{nM} + 8 \\, \\text{nM}} = \\frac{40}{48} = \\frac{5}{6} $$\n\n**Calculation of Simultaneous Inhibition**\nThe problem states that the binding events are independent and that the fraction of time both pathways are simultaneously inhibited is the product of their individual fractional occupancies. Let this combined fraction be $F_{\\text{inhib}}$.\n$$ F_{\\text{inhib}} = \\theta_{\\mathrm{p53}} \\times \\theta_{\\mathrm{pRb}} $$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$ F_{\\text{inhib}} = \\frac{2}{11} \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{10}{66} = \\frac{5}{33} $$\n\n**Final Numerical Answer**\nThe problem requires the final answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ F_{\\text{inhib}} = \\frac{5}{33} \\approx 0.151515... $$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $0.152$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.152}$$", "id": "4650436"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of protein-protein interactions, this exercise explores how subtle changes in a viral oncoprotein's structure can have dramatic functional consequences.

The E7 binding interface on pRb recognizes the canonical leucine–any–cysteine–any–glutamate motif, abbreviated $LXCXE$ (where $X$ denotes any amino acid). In structural terms, the $L$ side chain anchors into a hydrophobic pocket on pRb, the $C$ contributes to local motif geometry and packing, and the terminal $E$ forms an electrostatic interaction with basic residues in the pRb pocket domain. In the canonical pRb–E2F pathway governing $G_1 \\to S$ transition, hypophosphorylated pRb sequesters E2F transcription factors, repressing $S$-phase gene expression; E7 binding to pRb displaces or destabilizes this complex, promoting $S$-phase entry.\n\nConsider HPV16 E7 variants with point mutations within the $LXCXE$ motif.

The positive values of $\\Delta \\Delta G^\\circ$ for the mutations correctly signify a \"penalty\" or destabilization of the binding interaction, which aligns with the described importance of the wild-type residues ($L$ for hydrophobic anchoring, $E$ for electrostatics). The problem setup does not contain contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. The solution can proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe problem requires a two-part analysis: (i) determining the order of equilibrium dissociation constants ($K_d$) for the E7 variants, and (ii) predicting the biological consequence for cell cycle progression.\n\n**(i) Ordering of Equilibrium Dissociation Constants ($K_d$)**\n\nThe relationship between the standard Gibbs free energy of binding ($\\Delta G^\\circ$) and the equilibrium dissociation constant ($K_d$) is given by the fundamental thermodynamic equation:\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ = RT \\ln K_d $$\nwhere $R$ is the gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nFrom this equation, it is evident that $K_d$ is exponentially related to $\\Delta G^\\circ$ ($K_d = e^{\\Delta G^\\circ / (RT)}$). A more negative $\\Delta G^\\circ$ corresponds to a stronger binding interaction and thus a smaller $K_d$. Conversely, a less negative (or more positive) $\\Delta G^\\circ$ corresponds to a weaker binding interaction and a larger $K_d$. Therefore, to order the $K_d$ values, we must first calculate and order the $\\Delta G^\\circ$ values for each E7 variant.\n\nThe standard binding free energy for a mutant ($\\Delta G^\\circ_{mut}$) is calculated from the wild-type energy ($\\Delta G^\\circ_{WT}$) and the change due to the mutation ($\\Delta \\Delta G^\\circ_{mut}$):\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{mut} = \\Delta G^\\circ_{WT} + \\Delta \\Delta G^\\circ_{mut} $$\n\nGiven data:\n*   $\\Delta G^\\circ_{WT} = -8.0 \\text{ kcal/mol}$\n*   $\\Delta \\Delta G^\\circ_{L \\to A} = +1.6 \\text{ kcal/mol}$\n*   $\\Delta \\Delta G^\\circ_{C \\to S} = +0.3 \\text{ kcal/mol}$\n*   $\\Delta \\Delta G^\\circ_{E \\to Q} = +1.4 \\text{ kcal/mol}$\n\nCalculations for each variant:\n1.  **Wild-Type (WT):**\n    $$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{WT} = -8.0 \\text{ kcal/mol} $$\n2.  **$C \\to S$ Mutant:**\n    $$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{C \\to S} = -8.0 \\text{ kcal/mol} + 0.3 \\text{ kcal/mol} = -7.7 \\text{ kcal/mol} $$\n3.  **$E \\to Q$ Mutant:**\n    $$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{E \\to Q} = -8.0 \\text{ kcal/mol} + 1.4 \\text{ kcal/mol} = -6.6 \\text{ kcal/mol} $$\n4.  **$L \\to A$ Mutant:**\n    $$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{L \\to A} = -8.0 \\text{ kcal/mol} + 1.6 \\text{ kcal/mol} = -6.4 \\text{ kcal/mol} $$\n5.  **Triple Mutant ($L \\to A/C \\to S/E \\to Q$):**\n    The problem states the energy changes are additive.\n    $$ \\Delta \\Delta G^\\circ_{triple} = \\Delta \\Delta G^\\circ_{L \\to A} + \\Delta \\Delta G^\\circ_{C \\to S} + \\Delta \\Delta G^\\circ_{E \\to Q} = (+1.6) + (+0.3) + (+1.4) \\text{ kcal/mol} = +3.3 \\text{ kcal/mol} $$\n    $$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{triple} = -8.0 \\text{ kcal/mol} + 3.3 \\text{ kcal/mol} = -4.7 \\text{ kcal/mol} $$\n\nNow, we order the variants by their $\\Delta G^\\circ$ values, from most negative (strongest binding) to least negative (weakest binding):\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{WT} (-8.0) < \\Delta G^\\circ_{C \\to S} (-7.7) < \\Delta G^\\circ_{E \\to Q} (-6.6) < \\Delta G^\\circ_{L \\to A} (-6.4) < \\Delta G^\\circ_{triple} (-4.7) $$\nSince a higher $\\Delta G^\\circ$ corresponds to a higher $K_d$, the order of $K_d$ from lowest to highest is identical to the order of $\\Delta G^\\circ$:\n$$ K_d(\\text{WT}) < K_d(C \\to S) < K_d(E \\to Q) < K_d(L \\to A) < K_d(\\text{triple}) $$\n\n**(ii) Qualitative Consequence for $G_1 \\to S$ Control**\n\nThe biological function of E7 described in the problem is to bind pRb, causing the release of the E2F transcription factor. Liberated E2F then activates genes required for $S$-phase entry (e.g., Cyclin E).\n*   **Stronger E7-pRb binding (lower $K_d$)** leads to more efficient inactivation of pRb, greater release of E2F, and thus more robust promotion of $S$-phase entry.\n*   **Weaker E7-pRb binding (higher $K_d$)** leads to less efficient inactivation of pRb. Consequently, more pRb remains active to sequester E2F, resulting in weaker promotion of $S$-phase entry and a greater tendency for cells to remain arrested in $G_1$.\n\nBased on our binding affinity ranking, the ability of the E7 variants to promote $S$-phase entry will follow this order (from most potent to least potent):\n$$ \\text{WT} > C \\to S > E \\to Q > L \\to A > \\text{triple} $$\nThis represents a progressive reduction in the protein's oncogenic activity as its binding to pRb weakens. The triple mutant, having the weakest binding affinity (highest $K_d$), will be the least effective at overcoming the pRb-mediated $G_1$ checkpoint. Therefore, it will result in the state most closely resembling a normal $G_1$ arrest, characterized by persistent pRb–E2F repression.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. $K_d$ order (lowest to highest): wild-type < $C \\to S$ < $E \\to Q$ < $L \\to A$ < triple; consequence: progressive reduction in $S$-phase entry as binding weakens, with the triple mutant showing the greatest $G_1$ arrest due to persistent pRb–E2F repression.**\n    *   The $K_d$ order matches our derived order precisely.\n    *   The predicted consequence accurately reflects the link between binding affinity and biological function: weaker binding leads to less pRb inactivation, reduced $S$-phase entry, and a stronger $G_1$ arrest.

It claims the $L \\to A$ mutant binds more tightly (lower $K_d$) than wild-type, which is directly contradicted by its positive $\\Delta \\Delta G^\\circ$ of $+1.6 \\text{ kcal/mol}$.\n    *   The consequence is incorrect. The $L \\to A$ mutation weakens binding, and would therefore *reduce* $S$-phase entry, not increase it.\n    *   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. $K_d$ order (lowest to highest): wild-type < $C \\to S$ < $L \\to A$ < $E \\to Q$ < triple; consequence: the $E \\to Q$ mutant facilitates the strongest $S$-phase entry because neutral glutamine increases motif flexibility and enhances pRb disengagement from E2F.**\n    *   The $K_d$ order is incorrect. It incorrectly swaps the positions of the $L \\to A$ and $E \\to Q$ mutants. We calculated $K_d(E \\to Q) < K_d(L \\to A)$.\n    *   The consequence is incorrect. The strongest $S$-phase entry is caused by the wild-type E7, which is the strongest binder. The $E \\to Q$ mutant is weaker and thus less effective.
