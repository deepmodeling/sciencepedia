An inoculum containing misfolded prion protein conformers (commonly denoted as $\\mathrm{PrP^{Sc}}$) is treated with three enzymes prior to titration by Infectious Dose 50 (ID50) bioassay in a rodent model.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of prion biology and protein biochemistry, well-posed with sufficient data to determine the requested parameters, and presented in an objective, formal manner. All assumptions are clearly stated and are reasonable within the context of a simplified kinetic model.\n\nThe total initial infectivity, $I_{0}$, is composed of two fractions: a protein-dependent fraction susceptible to Proteinase K (PK), which we can denote as $I_{p,0}$, and a residual fraction resistant to PK, denoted as $I_{r,0}$. According to the problem statement, the relative contribution of the protein-dependent fraction is $\\alpha$.\n$$I_{p,0} = \\alpha I_{0}$$\nThe residual fraction is therefore:\n$$I_{r,0} = (1 - \\alpha) I_{0}$$\n\nThe experimental results with Ribonuclease (RNase) and Deoxyribonuclease (DNase) yield a fractional infectious titer of $f_{\\mathrm{RNase}} = 1$ and $f_{\\mathrm{DNase}} = 1$. Since these enzymes degrade RNA and DNA, respectively, and their application does not reduce infectivity, we conclude that nucleic acids are not essential for the infectious unit. This is consistent with the protein-only hypothesis of prion disease and validates focusing on the effects of the protease.\n\nThe degradation of the protein-dependent fraction, $I_p$, by PK is stated to follow first-order kinetics with respect to both the PK concentration, $c$, and the exposure time, $t$. This can be modeled by an exponential decay function. The amount of protein-dependent infectivity remaining after treatment, $I_p(c, t)$, is given by:\n$$I_p(c, t) = I_{p,0} \\exp(-kct)$$\nwhere $k$ is a rate constant. The residual fraction, $I_r$, is unaffected by PK, so its infectivity remains $I_{r,0}$.\n\nThe total infectivity after treatment, $I_{\\text{treated}}$, is the sum of the remaining protein-dependent fraction and the unchanged residual fraction:\n$$I_{\\text{treated}}(c, t) = I_p(c, t) + I_{r,0} = (\\alpha I_{0}) \\exp(-kct) + (1 - \\alpha) I_{0}$$\n\nThe fractional infectious titer, $f$, is defined as $f = I_{\\text{treated}}/I_{0}$.
