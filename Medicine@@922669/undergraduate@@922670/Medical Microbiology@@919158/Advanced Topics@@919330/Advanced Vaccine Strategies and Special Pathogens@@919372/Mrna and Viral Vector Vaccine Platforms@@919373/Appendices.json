The problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of acid-base chemistry and is well-posed. All necessary parameters and assumptions are provided.\n\nFirst, let us define the chemical species involved. Let $L$ represent the neutral, unprotonated form of the ionizable tertiary amine lipid. Let $LH^+$ represent the protonated form, which is the conjugate acid of the lipid $L$. The acid-base equilibrium in the endosome involves the dissociation of this conjugate acid:\n$$\nLH^+ \\rightleftharpoons L + H^+\n$$\nThe problem states that this system is at equilibrium. The acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, for this reaction is defined by the law of mass action:\n$$\nK_a = \\frac{[L][H^+]}{[LH^+]}\n$$\nwhere $[L]$, $[H^+]$, and $[LH^+]$ are the molar concentrations of the neutral lipid, protons, and protonated lipid, respectively.\n\nWe are tasked with finding the fraction of lipid that is protonated. Let us denote this fraction by $\\alpha$. By definition, this is the concentration of the protonated form divided by the total concentration of the lipid in both its protonated and neutral forms:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{[LH^+]}{[L]_{total}} = \\frac{[LH^+]}{[L] + [LH^+]}\n$$\nTo express $\\alpha$ as a function of $pH$ and $pK_a$, we must relate the ratio of concentrations $[L]/[LH^+]$ to these parameters. From the definition of $K_a$, we can rearrange the expression to solve for this ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{[L]}{[LH^+]} = \\frac{K_a}{[H^+]}\n$$\nThe definitions of $pH$ and $pK_a$ are given by:\n$$\npH = -\\log_{10}([H^+])\n$$\n$$\npK_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)\n$$\nTaking the base-$10$ logarithm of both sides of the ratio expression yields:\n$$\n\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[L]}{[LH^+]}\\right) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{K_a}{[H^+]}\\right) = \\log_{10}(K_a) - \\log_{10}([H^+])\n$$\nSubstituting the definitions of $pH$ and $pK_a$ into this equation gives the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n$$\n\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[L]}{[LH^+]}\\right) = -pK_a - (-pH) = pH - pK_a\n$$\nTo solve for the ratio itself, we take $10$ to the power of both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{[L]}{[LH^+]} = 10^{(pH - pK_a)}\n$$\nNow, we can substitute this result into the expression for the fraction $\\alpha$. A convenient algebraic step is to divide the numerator and the denominator of the fraction for $\\alpha$ by $[LH^+]$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{\\frac{[LH^+]}{[LH^+]}}{\\frac{[L]}{[LH^+]} + \\frac{[LH^+]}{[LH^+]}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{[L]}{[LH^+]} + 1}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the ratio $\\frac{[L]}{[LH^+]}$ gives the desired general expression for the fraction of protonated lipid:\n$$\n\\alpha(pH, pK_a) = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{(pH - pK_a)}}\n$$\nThis expression provides the equilibrium fraction of the lipid that is in its protonated, charged state ($LH^+$) as a function of the environmental $pH$ and the intrinsic $pK_a$ of its conjugate acid.\n\nNext, we evaluate this fraction numerically using the provided values: $pH = 5.5$ and $pK_a = 6.2$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{(5.5 - 6.2)}}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-0.7}}\n$$\nWe now calculate the value of $10^{-0.7}$:\n$$\n10^{-0.7} \\approx 0.1995262315\n$$\nSubstituting this value back into the expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.1995262315} = \\frac{1}{1.1995262315}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha \\approx 0.83366304\n$$\nThe problem requires the final result to be rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure is $6$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$\n\\alpha \\approx 0.8337\n$$\nThis result indicates that at an endosomal $pH$ of $5.5$, approximately $83.37\\%$ of the ionizable lipid molecules are protonated. This high degree of protonation leads to a positive charge on the lipid nanoparticles, which facilitates interaction with the negatively charged endosomal membrane, leading to membrane destabilization and the release of the mRNA payload into the cytoplasm.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.8337}\n$$", "id": "4653683"}, {"introduction": "Once the genetic instructions from a vaccine are inside a cell, the production of the target antigen begins, but this process is transient.
