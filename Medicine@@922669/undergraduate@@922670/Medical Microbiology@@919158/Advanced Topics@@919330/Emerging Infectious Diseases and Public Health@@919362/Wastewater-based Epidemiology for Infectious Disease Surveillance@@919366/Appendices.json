In quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR), the cycle threshold ($Ct$) relates to the initial target copy number $N_{0}$ through the per-cycle amplification efficiency $\\epsilon$ via the threshold condition that the amplified product reaches a fixed detection threshold $T$ at cycle $Ct$, which implies $N_{0}(1+\\epsilon)^{Ct} = T$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) and statistical analysis, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed in objective, unambiguous language. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires a four-part analysis: (1) performing an ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression, (2) deriving the analytical relationship between the regression slope and amplification efficiency, (3) constructing a confidence interval for the efficiency, and (4) reporting the point estimate for the efficiency.\n\nLet the independent variable be $x = \\log_{10} N_{0}$ and the dependent variable be $y = Ct$. The given data consists of $n=6$ pairs $(x_i, y_i)$:\n$(6, 20.1)$, $(5, 23.3)$, $(4, 26.7)$, $(3, 29.9)$, $(2, 33.3)$, $(1, 36.6)$.\n\n**1. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Linear Regression**\n\nWe fit the linear model $y = a + bx + \\varepsilon$, where $a$ is the intercept, $b$ is the slope, and $\\varepsilon$ represents the error term. The OLS estimates for $a$ and $b$ are found by minimizing the sum of squared residuals.\n\nFirst, we compute the necessary summary statistics:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 21 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i = 20.1 + 23.3 + 26.7 + 29.9 + 33.3 + 36.6 = 169.9 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 = 6^2 + 5^2 + 4^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 36 + 25 + 16 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 91 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i = (6)(20.1) + (5)(23.3) + (4)(26.7) + (3)(29.9) + (2)(33.3) + (1)(36.6) $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i = 120.6 + 116.5 + 106.8 + 89.7 + 66.6 + 36.6 = 536.8 $$\n\nThe sample means are:\n$$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum x_i}{n} = \\frac{21}{6} = 3.5 $$\n$$ \\bar{y} = \\frac{\\sum y_i}{n} = \\frac{169.9}{6} \\approx 28.3167 $$\n\nThe slope $b$ is calculated as:\n$$ b = \\frac{n \\sum (x_i y_i) - (\\sum x_i)(\\sum y_i)}{n \\sum (x_i^2) - (\\sum x_i)^2} = \\frac{6(536.8) - (21)(169.9)}{6(91) - (21)^2} = \\frac{3220.8 - 3567.9}{546 - 441} = \\frac{-347.1}{105} \\approx -3.3057 $$\nTo be exact, we can use the expressions for sums of squares and cross-products:\n$$ S_{xx} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 = \\sum x_i^2 - \\frac{(\\sum x_i)^2}{n} = 91 - \\frac{21^2}{6} = 91 - 73.5 = 17.5 $$\n$$ S_{xy} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y}) = \\sum x_i y_i - \\frac{(\\sum x_i)(\\sum y_i)}{n} = 536.8 - \\frac{(21)(169.9)}{6} = 536.8 - 594.65 = -57.85 $$\n$$ b = \\frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = \\frac{-57.85}{17.5} \\approx -3.305714 $$\n\nThe intercept $a$ is calculated as:\n$$ a = \\bar{y} - b\\bar{x} = \\frac{169.9}{6} - \\left(\\frac{-57.85}{17.5}\\right)(3.5) = \\frac{169.9}{6} + \\frac{57.85}{5} = \\frac{169.9}{6} + 11.57 \\approx 28.3167 + 11.57 = 39.8867 $$\nThe fitted regression line is $Ct \\approx 39.8867 - 3.3057 \\log_{10} N_{0}$.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Relationship between Slope $b$ and Efficiency $\\epsilon$**\n\nThe threshold condition for qPCR is given by $N_{0}(1+\\epsilon)^{Ct} = T$, where $N_0$ is the initial copy number, $\\epsilon$ is the amplification efficiency, $Ct$ is the cycle threshold, and $T$ is the fluorescence threshold constant.\n\nTo derive the relationship, we take the base-10 logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\log_{10}\\left(N_{0}(1+\\epsilon)^{Ct}\\right) = \\log_{10}(T) $$\nUsing the property $\\log_{10}(uv) = \\log_{10}(u) + \\log_{10}(v)$:\n$$ \\log_{10}(N_0) + \\log_{10}\\left((1+\\epsilon)^{Ct}\\right) = \\log_{10}(T) $$\nUsing the property $\\log_{10}(u^k) = k\\log_{10}(u)$:\n$$ \\log_{10}(N_0) + Ct \\log_{10}(1+\\epsilon) = \\log_{10}(T) $$\nWe rearrange this equation to solve for $Ct$:\n$$ Ct \\log_{10}(1+\\epsilon) = \\log_{10}(T) - \\log_{10}(N_0) $$\n$$ Ct = \\frac{\\log_{10}(T)}{\\log_{10}(1+\\epsilon)} - \\frac{1}{\\log_{10}(1+\\epsilon)} \\log_{10}(N_0) $$\nThis equation is of the linear form $y = a + bx$, where $y=Ct$ and $x=\\log_{10}(N_0)$. By comparing the coefficients, we identify the slope $b$:\n$$ b = -\\frac{1}{\\log_{10}(1+\\epsilon)} $$\nThis is the analytical relationship between the slope $b$ and the amplification efficiency $\\epsilon$. It can be rearranged to solve for $\\epsilon$: $\\epsilon = 10^{-1/b} - 1$.\n\n**3. Confidence Interval Construction**\n\nTo construct a $95\\%$ confidence interval for $b$, we first need its standard error, $SE(b)$.\nThe sum of squared errors ($SSE$) is computed. Based on the fitted model and data, $SSE \\approx 0.0089$.\nThe standard error of the regression is $s_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{SSE}{n-2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.0089}{4}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.002225} \\approx 0.04717$.\nThe standard error of the slope is $SE(b) = \\frac{s_e}{\\sqrt{S_{xx}}} = \\frac{0.04717}{\\sqrt{17.5}} \\approx \\frac{0.04717}{4.1833} \\approx 0.011276$.\nThe $95\\%$ confidence interval for $b$ is $b \\pm t_{\\alpha/2, n-2} \\cdot SE(b)$, with $n-2=4$ degrees of freedom. The critical value is $t_{0.025, 4} = 2.776$.\nCI for $b$: $-3.3057 \\pm 2.776 \\times 0.011276 \\Rightarrow -3.3057 \\pm 0.0313 \\Rightarrow [-3.3370, -3.2744]$.\nTo transform this to a CI for $\\epsilon$, we use the derived relation $\\epsilon(b) = 10^{-1/b} - 1$. This is a monotonically increasing function for $b<0$. Applying it to the endpoints:\n$\\epsilon_{lower} = 10^{-1/(-3.3370)} - 1 \\approx 10^{0.29967} - 1 \\approx 1.9937 - 1 = 0.9937$.\n$\\epsilon_{upper} = 10^{-1/(-3.2744)} - 1 \\approx 10^{0.3054} - 1 \\approx 2.020 - 1 = 1.020$.\nThe $95\\%$ CI for $\\epsilon$ is approximately $[0.994, 1.020]$.\n\n**4. Point Estimate of Amplification Efficiency $\\epsilon$**\n\nThe final task is to report the point estimate of $\\epsilon$. We use the calculated slope $b$ and the derived relationship from Part 2.\nFrom Part 1, the point estimate for the slope is $b = -3.305714...$.\nUsing the relationship derived in Part 2:\n$$ \\epsilon = 10^{-1/b} - 1 $$\nSubstitute the value of $b$:\n$$ \\epsilon = 10^{-1/(-3.305714...)} - 1 = 10^{1/3.305714...} - 1 $$\n$$ \\epsilon = 10^{0.302507...} - 1 $$\n$$ \\epsilon \\approx 2.0069076 - 1 = 1.0069076 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe number is $1.0069076...$. The first four significant figures are $1$, $0$, $0$, $6$. The fifth digit is $9$, which is $\\ge 5$, so we round up the fourth significant digit.\n$$ \\epsilon \\approx 1.007 $$\nThis is the point estimate of the amplification efficiency. A value of $\\epsilon=1$ corresponds to a perfect $100\\%$ doubling of product each cycle.

During an outbreak of a single viral pathogen, the goal is to estimate the community prevalence $p_k$ (the fraction of the population actively shedding at day $k$) from daily measurements of viral RNA concentration $C_k$ (genome copies per liter) in the influent. Assume the following fundamental base:\n- Mass balance and dilution in steady inflow imply that the concentration in wastewater on day $k$ is approximately proportional to the total shedding load divided by the daily flow, attenuated by first-order decay during sewer transit. Specifically, if the average per-capita shedding rate is $s$ (genome copies per person per day), sewer travel time is $t_s$ (days), the viral RNA decays with first-order rate constant $\\lambda$ (per day), and the daily flow is $Q_k$ (liters per day), then the noise-free concentration is $(N\\,p_k\\,s\\,\\exp(-\\lambda t_s))/Q_k$.\n- Aggregation over many contributors and measurement repeatability justify modeling process and measurement errors as Gaussian by the Central Limit Theorem and standard metrological practice for quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) assays.\n\nTasks:\n1) Using the principles above, formulate a linear Gaussian state-space model for the latent prevalence $p_k$ and the observed concentration $C_k$ by:\n   - Modeling the day-to-day prevalence dynamics as a slowly varying process justified by linearization of infection-recovery balance over short intervals.\n   - Writing the observation model based on the mass balance and decay relation, with additive measurement noise.\n\n2) From first principles of Bayesian inference under linear-Gaussian assumptions, derive the recursive estimator (Kalman Filter (KF)) for the posterior mean and variance of $p_k$ given observations up to day $k$, clearly stating the prediction and update steps in terms of model parameters and the day-specific dilution factor.\n\n3) Apply your derived filter to the following data and parameters to compute the posterior mean estimate of prevalence on day $k=2$:\n   - Population: $N = 1.0 \\times 10^{6}$ persons.\n   - Per-capita shedding: $s = 5.0 \\times 10^{7}$ genome copies per person per day.\n   - First-order decay rate: $\\lambda = 1.0$ per day.\n   - Sewer travel time: $t_s = 0.25$ days.\n   - Daily influent flow: $Q_1 = 1.5 \\times 10^{8}$ liters per day, $Q_2 = 1.2 \\times 10^{8}$ liters per day.\n   - Measurement noise variance: $r = (100)^{2}$ (genome copies per liter)$^{2}$.\n   - Process noise variance: $q = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}$.\n   - Prior for prevalence at day $0$: $p_0 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0.0015,\\,4.0 \\times 10^{-8})$.\n   - Measured concentrations: $C_1 = 420$ genome copies per liter, $C_2 = 500$ genome copies per liter.\n\nDefine the day-specific proportionality factor $\\alpha_k$ explicitly from the mass balance relation.

Round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "#### Part 1: State-Space Model Formulation\nThe problem requires the formulation of a linear Gaussian state-space model. This consists of two equations: a state equation describing the evolution of the latent variable (prevalence $p_k$), and an observation equation linking the state to the measurement (concentration $C_k$).\n\n1.  **State Equation**: The prevalence $p_k$ is described as a \"slowly varying process\". The simplest and most common linear model for such a process is a random walk, which states that the prevalence at day $k$ is equal to the prevalence at the previous day plus a small random fluctuation. This is consistent with a first-order Taylor approximation or linearization of more complex epidemiological dynamics (like SIR models) over a short time interval ($\\Delta t = 1$ day). The state equation is:\n    $$p_k = p_{k-1} + w_{k-1}$$\n    where $w_{k-1}$ is the process noise, assumed to be a zero-mean Gaussian random variable with variance $q$: $w_{k-1} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, q)$.\n\n2.  **Observation Equation**: The problem provides the deterministic relationship between the prevalence $p_k$ and the noise-free concentration. The observed concentration $C_k$ is this value plus additive measurement noise, $v_k$. The observation equation is:\n    $$C_k = \\frac{N s \\exp(-\\lambda t_s)}{Q_k} p_k + v_k$$\n    The measurement noise $v_k$ is assumed to be a zero-mean Gaussian random variable with variance $r$: $v_k \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, r)$. We can define a day-specific proportionality factor $\\alpha_k$ as requested:\n    $$\\alpha_k = \\frac{N s \\exp(-\\lambda t_s)}{Q_k}$$\n    Substituting this factor, the observation equation simplifies to a standard linear form:\n    $$C_k = \\alpha_k p_k + v_k$$\n\nThus, the complete linear Gaussian state-space model is:\n- State equation: $p_k = p_{k-1} + w_{k-1}$, with $w_{k-1} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, q)$\n- Observation equation: $C_k = \\alpha_k p_k + v_k$, with $v_k \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, r)$\n\n#### Part 2: Kalman Filter Derivation\nThe Kalman filter is a recursive Bayesian estimator for the posterior distribution of the state. We denote the posterior mean and variance of $p_k$ given observations up to day $j$ as $\\hat{p}_{k|j}$ and $P_{k|j}$ respectively. The algorithm proceeds in two steps: prediction and update.\n\nAssume we have the posterior for $p_{k-1}$ given observations up to day $k-1$: $p_{k-1} | C_{1:k-1} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\hat{p}_{k-1|k-1}, P_{k-1|k-1})$.\n\n1.  **Prediction Step**: We predict the distribution of the state $p_k$ before observing $C_k$. This is the prior distribution for the current time step.\n    -   The predicted mean is the expectation of the state equation:\n        $$\\hat{p}_{k|k-1} = \\mathbb{E}[p_k | C_{1:k-1}] = \\mathbb{E}[p_{k-1} + w_{k-1} | C_{1:k-1}] = \\mathbb{E}[p_{k-1} | C_{1:k-1}] + \\mathbb{E}[w_{k-1}] = \\hat{p}_{k-1|k-1} + 0 = \\hat{p}_{k-1|k-1}$$\n    -   The predicted variance is the variance of the state equation. Since the estimation error at step $k-1$ (with variance $P_{k-1|k-1}$) and the process noise $w_{k-1}$ are independent:\n        $$P_{k|k-1} = \\text{Var}(p_k | C_{1:k-1}) = \\text{Var}(p_{k-1} + w_{k-1} | C_{1:k-1}) = \\text{Var}(p_{k-1} | C_{1:k-1}) + \\text{Var}(w_{k-1}) = P_{k-1|k-1} + q$$\n    So, the prior distribution for $p_k$ is $p_k | C_{1:k-1} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\hat{p}_{k|k-1}, P_{k|k-1})$.\n\n2.  **Update Step**: We use the new observation $C_k$ to update the prior into a posterior distribution for $p_k$. By Bayes' rule, the posterior is proportional to the likelihood times the prior. For linear Gaussian models, the posterior is also Gaussian. We derive its parameters by considering the joint distribution of $(p_k, C_k)$ conditioned on past observations $C_{1:k-1}$.\n    -   The prior for $p_k$ is $\\mathcal{N}(\\hat{p}_{k|k-1}, P_{k|k-1})$.\n    -   The likelihood for $C_k$ is given by the observation model: $C_k | p_k \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\alpha_k p_k, r)$.\n    -   The joint distribution is Gaussian with mean vector:\n        $$\\mathbb{E}\\begin{pmatrix} p_k \\\\ C_k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbb{E}[p_k] \\\\ \\mathbb{E}[\\alpha_k p_k + v_k] \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hat{p}_{k|k-1} \\\\ \\alpha_k \\hat{p}_{k|k-1} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    -   And covariance matrix:\n        $$\n        \\text{Cov}\\begin{pmatrix} p_k \\\\ C_k \\end{pmatrix} = \n        \\begin{pmatrix} \\text{Var}(p_k) & \\text{Cov}(p_k, C_k) \\\\ \\text{Cov}(C_k, p_k) & \\text{Var}(C_k) \\end{pmatrix} =\n        \\begin{pmatrix} P_{k|k-1} & \\alpha_k P_{k|k-1} \\\\ \\alpha_k P_{k|k-1} & \\alpha_k^2 P_{k|k-1} + r \\end{pmatrix}\n        $$\n    -   Using the standard formula for conditional Gaussian distributions, the posterior distribution $p_k | C_k$ has mean $\\hat{p}_{k|k}$ and variance $P_{k|k}$ given by:\n        $$\\hat{p}_{k|k} = \\hat{p}_{k|k-1} + (\\alpha_k P_{k|k-1}) (\\alpha_k^2 P_{k|k-1} + r)^{-1} (C_k - \\alpha_k \\hat{p}_{k|k-1})$$\n        $$P_{k|k} = P_{k|k-1} - (\\alpha_k P_{k|k-1}) (\\alpha_k^2 P_{k|k-1} + r)^{-1} (\\alpha_k P_{k|k-1})$$\n    -   To simplify, we define the following terms:\n        -   **Innovation** or **Residual**: $y_k = C_k - \\alpha_k \\hat{p}_{k|k-1}$ (the difference between the measurement and its prediction).\n        -   **Innovation Covariance**: $S_k = \\alpha_k^2 P_{k|k-1} + r$ (the variance of the innovation).\n        -   **Kalman Gain**: $K_k = P_{k|k-1} \\alpha_k S_k^{-1} = \\frac{P_{k|k-1} \\alpha_k}{\\alpha_k^2 P_{k|k-1} + r}$.\n    -   The update equations become:\n        -   **Updated State Mean**: $\\hat{p}_{k|k} = \\hat{p}_{k|k-1} + K_k y_k$\n        -   **Updated State Covariance**: $P_{k|k} = (1 - K_k \\alpha_k) P_{k|k-1}$\n\n#### Part 3: Application and Calculation\nWe apply the derived filter for $k=1$ and $k=2$.\n\n**Parameters and Initial Conditions:**\n-   Prior at $k=0$: $\\hat{p}_{0|0} = 0.0015$, $P_{0|0} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-8}$\n-   Variances: $q = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}$, $r = (100)^2 = 10000$\n-   Measurements: $C_1 = 420$, $C_2 = 500$\n-   Day-specific factors depend on $\\alpha_k = \\frac{N s \\exp(-\\lambda t_s)}{Q_k}$.
