This exercise delves into the perplexing phenomenon of heteroresistance, where a bacterial population contains a small, hidden subpopulation of highly resistant cells that can evade standard detection methods. By applying principles of population dynamics, you will model how even a tiny fraction of resistant cells can survive and grow under antibiotic pressure, and why a standard Broth Microdilution assay might fail to detect them, leading to potential treatment failure [@problem_id:4654936].", "problem": "A clinical isolate of Acinetobacter baumannii is suspected to be heteroresistant to colistin, meaning that within a clonal population there exist subpopulations with different Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values for colistin. Consider a standard Broth Microdilution (BMD) assay performed at a fixed colistin concentration $C$ such that the bulk susceptible majority has MIC $C_s$ and a rare resistant subpopulation has MIC $C_r$, with $C_s < C < C_r$. Let the initial inoculum be $N_0 = 5 \\times 10^5$ Colony Forming Units per milliliter (CFU/mL), and let the resistant subpopulation comprise a fraction $p$ of the inoculum at $t = 0$. Assume well-mixed conditions with no spatial gradients, and model net population change using exponential dynamics: in the presence of colistin at concentration $C$, the susceptible majority has net growth rate $g_s(C) < 0$ (dominated by killing), while the resistant subpopulation has net growth rate $g_r(C) > 0$ because $C < C_r$. To keep the analysis concrete, suppose that the resistant subpopulation doubles approximately once per hour in the presence of $C$, so $g_r(C) = \\ln(2)\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$, and that the BMD endpoint is read at $t = 18\\,\\mathrm{h}$. Assume that visible turbidity in the BMD well requires the total population to exceed a detection threshold $N_{\\mathrm{det}} = 10^7\\,\\mathrm{CFU/mL}$.\n\nUsing first principles of Darwinian selection (differential survival and reproduction under an environmental stressor) and population dynamics (exponential growth and decay), answer the following. Which option best explains why BMD may report “no visible growth” at $C$ (suggesting susceptibility) even though a heteroresistant subpopulation exists, and justifies this outcome quantitatively?\n\nA. Under $C_s < C < C_r$, selection immediately eliminates the susceptible majority ($g_s(C) < 0$) and favors the resistant subpopulation, but detection depends on absolute numbers. The resistant subpopulation starts at $N_r(0) = p N_0$ and grows as $N_r(t) = p N_0 e^{g_r(C) t}$. If $N_r(t) < N_{\\mathrm{det}}$ by $t = 18\\,\\mathrm{h}$, no turbidity appears even though survivors exist. With $N_0 = 5 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{CFU/mL}$, $g_r(C) = \\ln(2)\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$, $t = 18\\,\\mathrm{h}$, and $N_{\\mathrm{det}} = 10^7\\,\\mathrm{CFU/mL}$, heteroresistance is missed whenever $p < \\dfrac{N_{\\mathrm{det}}}{N_0 e^{g_r(C) t}} \\approx 7.6 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\nB. Heteroresistance in Acinetobacter baumannii is primarily driven by a ubiquitous plasmid-dependent mobilized colistin resistance gene that confers uniform high-level resistance to all cells, so any BMD well containing colistin will always show visible growth regardless of $p$; therefore BMD cannot miss resistant subpopulations.\n\nC. In BMD, the susceptible majority “absorbs” or neutralizes colistin so effectively that the resistant subpopulation is prevented from expanding; thus the presence of many susceptible cells, not detection thresholds or growth kinetics, is the principal reason heteroresistance is undercalled.\n\nD. Any single resistant cell present at $t = 0$ will inevitably produce turbidity by $t = 18\\,\\mathrm{h}$ under $C$, because selection eliminates susceptible competitors and exponential growth guarantees $p N_0 e^{g_r(C) t} \\gg N_{\\mathrm{det}}$ for all $p > 0$; therefore BMD always detects heteroresistance when present.\n\nE. Heteroresistance can only be revealed in agar-based gradient assays (for example, diffusion strips) because selection requires a spatial antibiotic gradient; in uniform liquid conditions like BMD, selection cannot operate, so heteroresistance is never detectable in broth.", "solution": "Begin from core definitions and well-tested facts. Heteroresistance is a population-level phenomenon in which a clonal bacterial population contains subpopulations with different phenotypic resistance levels, typically due to reversible gene expression changes or rare mutations affecting targets or membranes (for colistin, lipid A modification via two-component regulatory systems is a common mechanism). Under Darwinian selection, when exposed to an antibiotic concentration $C$, cells with higher MIC than $C$ have a net advantage relative to those with MIC lower than $C$. In a well-mixed liquid culture at fixed $C$, selection operates through differential net growth rates: susceptible cells have $g_s(C) < 0$ (net death), while resistant cells have $g_r(C) > 0$ (net growth) if $C < C_r$.\n\nPopulation dynamics for the resistant subpopulation can be approximated as exponential: $N_r(t) = N_r(0) e^{g_r(C) t} = p N_0 e^{g_r(C) t}$. Detection in Broth Microdilution (BMD) is based on visible turbidity, which requires an absolute count exceeding a threshold $N_{\\mathrm{det}}$ by the endpoint time $t$. Therefore, even if selection favors the resistant subpopulation, the assay may fail to show growth if $N_r(t)$ stays below $N_{\\mathrm{det}}$.\n\nQuantitatively, the condition for visible turbidity due solely to the resistant subpopulation is\n$$\np N_0 e^{g_r(C) t} \\ge N_{\\mathrm{det}}.\n$$\nEquivalently, the minimum fraction $p_{\\min}$ required for detection is\n$$\np_{\\min} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{det}}}{N_0 e^{g_r(C) t}}.\n$$\nUsing the given values $N_0 = 5 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{CFU/mL}$, $g_r(C) = \\ln(2)\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$, $t = 18\\,\\mathrm{h}$, and $N_{\\mathrm{det}} = 10^7\\,\\mathrm{CFU/mL}$, compute $e^{g_r(C) t} = e^{\\ln(2)\\, t} = 2^t = 2^{18} = 262{,}144$. Then\n$$\np_{\\min} = \\frac{10^7}{\\left(5 \\times 10^5\\right) \\times 262{,}144}\n= \\frac{10^7}{1.31072 \\times 10^{11}}\n\\approx 7.6 \\times 10^{-5}.\n$$\nThus, if the resistant subpopulation fraction satisfies $p < 7.6 \\times 10^{-5}$, the culture will not reach the turbidity threshold by $t = 18\\,\\mathrm{h}$ and the BMD well will appear “no growth” despite the presence and selective advantage of the resistant subpopulation. This explains how heteroresistance can be missed by BMD: detection hinges on absolute numbers and time-to-threshold, not merely on relative fitness advantage.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This option correctly applies selection principles ($g_s(C) < 0$ for susceptible cells and $g_r(C) > 0$ for resistant cells when $C_s < C < C_r$) and derives the exponential growth condition for detection. It computes the threshold fraction\n$$\np_{\\min} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{det}}}{N_0 e^{g_r(C) t}}\n$$\nwith the provided parameters, obtaining $p_{\\min} \\approx 7.6 \\times 10^{-5}$. It concludes that for $p < p_{\\min}$, BMD will miss heteroresistance because the resistant subpopulation, though selected, remains below the turbidity threshold at the endpoint. This is both conceptually and quantitatively sound. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. This option claims uniform high-level resistance driven by a ubiquitous plasmid-dependent mobilized colistin resistance gene, implying no heterogeneity and inevitable growth in BMD. In Acinetobacter baumannii, heteroresistance often involves chromosomal modifications (for example, lipid A alterations via two-component systems), and uniform high-level resistance across all cells is not a defining feature of heteroresistance. Moreover, even if a resistance gene were present, detection would still depend on absolute cell numbers and growth kinetics; BMD can miss low-frequency subpopulations. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. This option invokes “absorption” or neutralization of colistin by the susceptible majority as the primary reason BMD undercalls heteroresistance. In well-mixed BMD at fixed $C$, the dominant mechanisms are pharmacodynamic killing and growth; while inoculum effects can exist for some antibiotics, the key determinant for missing heteroresistance in this context is the combination of low initial resistant fraction $p$, limited time $t$, and the detection threshold $N_{\\mathrm{det}}$, not shielding by susceptible cells. The option neglects the quantitative detection criterion $p N_0 e^{g_r(C) t} \\ge N_{\\mathrm{det}}$. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. This option asserts that any single resistant cell will always produce turbidity by $t = 18\\,\\mathrm{h}$, effectively claiming $p N_0 e^{g_r(C) t} \\gg N_{\\mathrm{det}}$ for all $p > 0$. Using the given parameters, if $p$ is extremely small (for example, $p = 10^{-6}$), then\n$$\np N_0 e^{g_r(C) t} = 10^{-6} \\times \\left(5 \\times 10^5\\right) \\times 262{,}144 \\approx 131{.}1,\n$$\nwhich is far below $N_{\\mathrm{det}} = 10^7$. Therefore, one or a few resistant cells cannot guarantee turbidity within $18\\,\\mathrm{h}$. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nE. This option claims selection cannot operate in uniform liquid conditions. In fact, selection operates whenever there are differential net growth rates under an environmental stressor, regardless of spatial gradients. While agar gradient methods can help visualize heteroresistant “tails” by providing local niches where $C$ is below $C_r$, broth assays still impose selection; the main reason BMD may miss heteroresistance is the detection threshold and time constraints relative to the initial fraction $p$ and $g_r(C)$.

Express the risk ratio as a decimal, and round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated and deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of clinical epidemiology, self-contained with all necessary data for the requested calculations and reasoning, and well-posed. The data provided are internally consistent: for the multidrug-resistant (MDR) group, the sum of patients in the high-severity ($90$) and low-severity ($60$) strata equals the total ($150$); for the susceptible group, the sum of patients in the high-severity ($60$) and low-severity ($140$) strata equals the total ($200$). The task is objective and requires the application of standard epidemiological methods.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the crude risk ratio of $30$-day mortality, comparing patients with MDR *Acinetobacter* bacteremia to those with susceptible strains. A risk ratio ($RR$) is a measure of association between an exposure and an outcome, defined as the ratio of the risk of the outcome in the exposed group to the risk of the outcome in the unexposed group.\n\nLet $R_{MDR}$ denote the risk of $30$-day mortality in the MDR group (the exposed group).\nLet $R_{SUS}$ denote the risk of $30$-day mortality in the susceptible group (the unexposed group).\n\nThe risk in each group is calculated as the number of individuals who experience the outcome (death) divided by the total number of individuals in that group.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of deaths ($D_{MDR}$) and the total number of patients ($N_{MDR}$) in the MDR group. The data are provided stratified by severity.\nTotal patients in MDR group: $N_{MDR} = 150$.\nDeaths in the high-severity MDR subgroup: $45$.\nDeaths in the low-severity MDR subgroup: $12$.\nTotal deaths in the MDR group:\n$$D_{MDR} = 45 + 12 = 57$$\nThe risk of mortality in the MDR group is therefore:\n$$R_{MDR} = \\frac{D_{MDR}}{N_{MDR}} = \\frac{57}{150}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of deaths ($D_{SUS}$) and the total number of patients ($N_{SUS}$) in the susceptible group.\nTotal patients in susceptible group: $N_{SUS} = 200$.\nDeaths in the high-severity susceptible subgroup: $18$.\nDeaths in the low-severity susceptible subgroup: $14$.\nTotal deaths in the susceptible group:\n$$D_{SUS} = 18 + 14 = 32$$\nThe risk of mortality in the susceptible group is therefore:\n$$R_{SUS} = \\frac{D_{SUS}}{N_{SUS}} = \\frac{32}{200}$$\n\nThe crude risk ratio ($RR_{crude}$) is the ratio of these two risks:\n$$RR_{crude} = \\frac{R_{MDR}}{R_{SUS}} = \\frac{57/150}{32/200}$$\nWe perform the numerical calculation:\n$$R_{MDR} = \\frac{57}{150} = 0.38$$\n$$R_{SUS} = \\frac{32}{200} = 0.16$$\n$$RR_{crude} = \\frac{0.38}{0.16} = 2.375$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the crude risk ratio is $2.375$. This suggests that patients with MDR bacteremia have $2.375$ times the risk of dying within $30$ days compared to patients with susceptible bacteremia.\n\nThe second part of the task is to reason about how severity of illness could act as a confounder. A variable is a confounder if it meets three criteria:\n$1$. It is associated with the outcome (mortality).\n$2$. It is associated with the exposure (MDR status).\n$3$. It is not on the causal pathway from the exposure to the outcome.\n\nLet's examine each criterion for \"severity of illness\":\n\nCriterion $1$: Association with the outcome (mortality).\nWe assess if high severity is a risk factor for death, independent of MDR status.\nLet's calculate the overall risk of death in the high-severity stratum versus the low-severity stratum.\nTotal patients with high severity: $90$ (MDR) $+ 60$ (SUS) $= 150$.\nTotal deaths in high-severity patients: $45$ (MDR) $+ 18$ (SUS) $= 63$.\nRisk in high-severity stratum: $R_{high} = \\frac{63}{150} = 0.42$.\nTotal patients with low severity: $60$ (MDR) $+ 140$ (SUS) $= 200$.\nTotal deaths in low-severity patients: $12$ (MDR) $+ 14$ (SUS) $= 26$.\nRisk in low-severity stratum: $R_{low} = \\frac{26}{200} = 0.13$.\nSince the risk of death is substantially higher in the high-severity group ($0.42$) compared to the low-severity group ($0.13$), severity of illness is strongly associated with the outcome.\n\nCriterion $2$: Association with the exposure (MDR status).\nWe check if the distribution of the severity of illness is different between the MDR and susceptible groups.\nProportion of high-severity patients in the MDR group: $\\frac{90}{150} = 0.60$ or $60\\%$.\nProportion of high-severity patients in the susceptible group: $\\frac{60}{200} = 0.30$ or $30\\%$.\nSince these proportions are different, with the MDR group having a higher prevalence of severely ill patients, severity of illness is associated with the exposure.\n\nCriterion $3$: Not on the causal pathway.\nThe problem states that severity is measured by the APACHE II score at bacteremia onset. The MDR status of the infecting organism does not cause the patient's acute physiological derangement present at the time of diagnosis. Rather, it is more plausible that sicker patients (e.g., those with longer hospital stays, more prior antibiotic exposure) are more likely to acquire an MDR organism. Therefore, severity of illness is not on the causal pathway from MDR status to mortality.\n\nSince all three criteria are met, severity of illness is a confounder in the relationship between MDR status and mortality. The crude risk ratio of $2.375$ is a biased estimate of the true effect of MDR on mortality. Because the confounding variable (high severity) is a risk factor for the outcome and is more prevalent in the exposed (MDR) group, it results in positive confounding, meaning the crude RR overestimates the true causal effect.\n\nTo illustrate this, we can calculate the stratum-specific risk ratios:\nFor the high-severity stratum:\n$R_{MDR, high} = \\frac{45}{90} = 0.5$\n$R_{SUS, high} = \\frac{18}{60} = 0.3$\n$RR_{high} = \\frac{0.5}{0.3} \\approx 1.667$\nFor the low-severity stratum:\n$R_{MDR, low} = \\frac{12}{60} = 0.2$\n$R_{SUS, low} = \\frac{14}{140} = 0.1$\n$RR_{low} = \\frac{0.2}{0.1} = 2.0$\n\nBoth stratum-specific RRs ($1.667$ and $2.0$) are lower than the crude RR ($2.375$), which confirms the presence of positive confounding. The crude association is distorted upwards because a larger fraction of the MDR group was already at high risk of death due to their severe underlying illness. The final reported answer is the value of the crude risk ratio as requested.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.375}$$", "id": "4654923"}]}
