We will analyze each piece of evidence.\n\n1.  **Energy Source Analysis**: The problem states that the pump's activity is coupled to the proton motive force ($\\Delta p$) and not to $\\mathrm{ATP}$ hydrolysis.\n    -   **Evidence for $\\Delta p$ dependence**: Dye efflux is \"abolished by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP)\". CCCP is a protonophore, a chemical that shuttles protons across the membrane, thereby dissipating the transmembrane proton gradient ($\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$) and often the membrane potential ($\\Delta \\psi$). Together, these components constitute the proton motive force ($\\Delta p$). Abolishing efflux by collapsing $\\Delta p$ demonstrates that the pump is a secondary active transporter that uses the proton gradient as its energy source. As it's an efflux pump, it most likely functions as a drug/$\\mathrm{H}^+$ antiporter, using the influx of protons down their electrochemical gradient to power the efflux of the substrate against its concentration gradient.\n    -   **Evidence against $\\mathrm{ATP}$ dependence**: Dye efflux is \"unaffected by sodium orthovanadate\". Vanadate is a phosphate analog that inhibits several classes of ATPases, including the P-type ATPases and the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, by locking them in a post-hydrolysis transition state. Insensitivity to vanadate strongly indicates that the transporter is not a primary active transporter that relies on $\\mathrm{ATP}$ hydrolysis.\n\n    **Conclusion on Energy Source**: The pump is a secondary active transporter that utilizes the proton motive force ($\\Delta p$).\n\n2.  **Structural and Phylogenetic Analysis**: The problem provides clues related to the pump's structure and distribution.\n    -   **Evidence**: The pump is \"broadly in Gram-negative bacteria but are rarely found or are functionally absent in Gram-positive species\". The problem explicitly links this to bacterial envelope architecture, noting that Gram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane allowing for tripartite systems, while Gram-positives do not.\n\n    **Conclusion on Structure**: This distribution pattern strongly suggests that the pump is an integral component of a tripartite efflux system. Such systems consist of three proteins: an inner membrane transporter (the pump itself), a periplasmic adaptor protein (PAP), and an outer membrane factor (OMF). This entire complex spans from the cytoplasm to the cell exterior, allowing Gram-negative bacteria to bypass the periplasm and expel substrates directly into the external medium. The requirement for an outer membrane protein (OMF) explains why these systems are characteristic of Gram-negative bacteria and absent in Gram-positives.\n\n3.  **Synthesis**: We are looking for a superfamily of efflux pumps that are:\n    -   $\\Delta p$-driven secondary active transporters.\n    -   Typically form tripartite systems.\n    -   Are therefore found almost exclusively in Gram-negative bacteria.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nWe will evaluate each option against the derived profile.\n\n**A. Adenosine Triphosphate-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporters; they extrude cationic dyes and are unaffected by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone ($\\mathrm{CCCP}$), consistent with primary active transport, and they are generally absent from Gram-positive bacteria.**\n-   **Analysis**: ABC transporters are primary active transporters that hydrolyze $\\mathrm{ATP}$ for energy. They would be inhibited by vanadate and would be largely unaffected by CCCP. The problem statement explicitly shows the opposite: the pump is *abolished* by CCCP and *unaffected* by vanadate. Furthermore, ABC transporters are ubiquitous and are found in great numbers in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, so the claim that they are \"generally absent from Gram-positive bacteria\" is factually incorrect.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**B. Resistance-Nodulation-Division (RND) transporters; they are proton motive force ($\\Delta p$)-dependent secondary active antiporters inhibited by $\\mathrm{CCCP}$, generally insensitive to vanadate because they do not hydrolyze $\\mathrm{ATP}$, and are largely restricted to Gram-negative bacteria due to their requirement for a tripartite assembly with an outer-membrane channel.**\n-   **Analysis**: This option matches all the evidence perfectly.\n    -   **Energy Source**: RND transporters are indeed drug/$\\mathrm{H}^+$ antiporters that utilize $\\Delta p$. They are therefore inhibited by protonophores like CCCP and are not inhibited by ATPase inhibitors like vanadate.\n    -   **Structure and Distribution**: The RND family is the archetypal example of transporters that form tripartite efflux systems in Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., AcrAB-TolC in *Escherichia coli*). Their functional reliance on an outer membrane channel (the OMF, e.g., TolC) explains why this family is almost entirely restricted to Gram-negative bacteria.\n-   **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**C. Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) transporters; they are $\\mathrm{H}^+$-coupled secondary transporters inhibited by $\\mathrm{CCCP}$, not inhibited by vanadate, and are absent from Gram-positive bacteria.**\n-   **Analysis**: MFS transporters are indeed often $\\mathrm{H}^+$-coupled secondary transporters, which fits the inhibitor profile (CCCP-sensitive, vanadate-insensitive). However, the claim that they are \"absent from Gram-positive bacteria\" is patently false. The MFS is one of the largest and most diverse superfamilies of transporters, with numerous members in Gram-positive species that are major contributors to antibiotic resistance (e.g., NorA in *Staphylococcus aureus*). Therefore, MFS transporters do not fit the phylogenetic distribution described in the problem.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. Multidrug And Toxic Compound Extrusion (MATE) transporters; they are typically $\\mathrm{Na}^+$-coupled secondary transporters, thus inhibited by $\\mathrm{CCCP}$ but not by vanadate, and they are largely restricted to Gram-negative bacteria.**\n-   **Analysis**: MATE transporters are secondary active antiporters, but they can be coupled to either $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ or $\\mathrm{H}^+$ gradients. The problem's data (abolition by CCCP, a *protonophore*) points more directly to $\\mathrm{H}^+$ coupling than $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ coupling. More importantly, the claim that they are \"largely restricted to Gram-negative bacteria\" is false. MATE transporters are found widely in all three domains of life, including in Gram-positive bacteria. Thus, they do not fit the phylogenetic distribution.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**E. Small Multidrug Resistance (SMR) transporters; they are $\\mathrm{H}^+$-coupled and inhibited by $\\mathrm{CCCP}$, not inhibited by vanadate, and are absent from Gram-positive bacteria.**\n-   **Analysis**: The SMR family consists of small, $\\mathrm{H}^+$-coupled secondary transporters, so the inhibitor profile is consistent with the data. However, as with MFS and MATE, the claim that they are \"absent from Gram-positive bacteria\" is false. The SMR family is found in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. They are also single-component inner-membrane proteins (though they form oligomers) and do not form tripartite systems, failing to match the structural inference.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4627142"}, {"introduction": "Once a pump is identified, the next critical question is: how effective is it?

Using points 1 and 3:\nSlope $m = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{60 - 30}{2 - 3} = \\frac{30}{-1} = -30$.\nFrom the slope, $m = -K_{m} = -30$, which gives $K_{m} = 30\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\nThe y-intercept $c$ is found using $y = mx + c$:\n$30 = (-30)(3) + c \\implies 30 = -90 + c \\implies c = 120$.\nFrom the intercept, $c = V_{\\max} = 120\\ \\mathrm{nmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\nThe parameters obtained from the Eadie–Hofstee analysis ($V_{\\max} = 120\\ \\mathrm{nmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, $K_{m} = 30\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$) are identical to those from the Lineweaver–Burk analysis, thus providing the required verification.\n\nThe final part of the problem asks for a qualitative discussion of which linear transformation is more biased, assuming the dominant experimental variance is approximately constant in $v$. Let this constant variance be $\\sigma^2(v) \\approx \\sigma^2$.\n\nThe Lineweaver–Burk (LB) plot uses the transformed variables $y_{LB} = 1/v$ and $x_{LB} = 1/[S]$. Using standard error propagation, the variance of the transformed dependent variable, $\\sigma^2(1/v)$, is approximated by $(\\frac{d(1/v)}{dv})^2 \\sigma^2(v) = (-\\frac{1}{v^2})^2 \\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{v^4}$. This transformation makes the variance of the data points highly unequal (heteroscedastic). Measurements at low substrate concentrations, where $v$ is small, will have their errors magnified enormously. For example, a measurement of $v$ at $1/10$ of its maximal value will have an error variance in the LB plot that is $10^4$ times larger than a measurement near saturation. An unweighted linear regression, which assumes equal variance for all points, will be heavily biased by these high-error, high-leverage points at large values of $1/[S]$ and $1/v$.\n\nThe Eadie–Hofstee (EH) plot uses the variables $y_{EH} = v$ and $x_{EH} = v/[S]$. The dependent variable, $y_{EH}$, is $v$ itself. Therefore, its variance is constant, $\\sigma^2(v)=\\sigma^2$, which is ideal for the assumptions of linear regression concerning the dependent variable. However, the independent variable, $x_{EH} = v/[S]$, now contains the experimental error from $v$. The variance of $x_{EH}$ is approximately $\\sigma^2(v)/[S]^2 = \\sigma^2/[S]^2$. Standard linear regression assumes the independent variable is error-free. While the EH plot violates this assumption, the distortion of the error structure is generally less severe than in the LB plot. The LB plot's $1/v^4$ weighting of variance is an extreme distortion. Therefore, under the condition of constant variance in $v$, the **Lineweaver-Burk plot is expected to be significantly more biased** than the Eadie-Hofstee plot.\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $V_{\\max}/K_{m}$. Using the consistent values obtained from both methods:\n$V_{\\max} = 120\\ \\mathrm{nmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$\n$K_{m} = 30\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$\nThe ratio, often called the specificity constant, is:\n$$\\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_{m}} = \\frac{120\\ \\mathrm{nmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}}{30\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}} = 4\\ \\mathrm{nmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\nThus, the final numerical answer is $4.00$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.00}$$", "id": "4627081"}, {"introduction": "This final practice synthesizes our knowledge by modeling the pump's overall impact on drug accumulation within a cell.

This is primarily due to the model's assumption that the protonophore CCCP leads to a complete and total inactivation of the RND pump. In reality, the collapse of the proton motive force ($\\Delta p$) by a chemical uncoupler may be incomplete. A residual $\\Delta p$ would support some level of residual pump activity. If the pump remains partially active after CCCP treatment, it will continue to export the antibiotic, causing the true steady-state intracellular concentration $C_{\\mathrm{in,CCCP}}$ to be lower than the extracellular concentration $C_{\\mathrm{out}}$. Our model calculates $\\Phi$ using $C_{\\mathrm{in,CCCP}} = C_{\\mathrm{out}}$ in the numerator. Since the real numerator ($C_{\\mathrm{in,CCCP,real}}$) would be smaller, while the denominator ($C_{\\mathrm{in,active}}$) remains the same, the real fold-increase $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{real}}$ will be smaller than the calculated model value $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{model}}$. Thus, the calculation provides an upper limit on the expected experimental result.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.61}\n$$", "id": "4627148"}]}
