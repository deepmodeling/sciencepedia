A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds by addressing the three tasks specified in the problem statement.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points, denoted $(B^{*}, P^{*})$, are solutions to the system where the rates of change of both populations are zero. Thus, we set $\\frac{dB}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0$.\n\nThe system of algebraic equations is:\n$$\nB(r - kP) = 0 \\quad \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\nP(\\beta kB - \\delta) = 0 \\quad \\quad (2)\n$$\nFrom equation $(1)$, we have two possibilities: $B=0$ or $r - kP = 0$.\nFrom equation $(2)$, we have two possibilities: $P=0$ or $\\beta kB - \\delta = 0$.\n\nWe find the equilibrium points by examining the combinations of these possibilities.\n\n1.  **Trivial (Extinction) Equilibrium**:\n    Let $B^{*} = 0$. Substituting this into equation $(2)$ yields $P(-\\delta) = 0$. Since $\\delta > 0$ is a given parameter, this implies $P^{*} = 0$.\n    This gives the first equilibrium point, where both populations are extinct:\n    $$\n    (B_1^{*}, P_1^{*}) = (0, 0)\n    $$\n    If we start with $P^*=0$, equation (1) becomes $B(r)=0$, which implies $B^*=0$ as $r>0$. This also leads to the same point.\n\n2.  **Coexistence Equilibrium**:\n    For a non-trivial solution where both $B^{*}>0$ and $P^{*}>0$, we must satisfy the other conditions:\n    From $r - kP = 0$, we solve for $P^{*}$:\n    $$\n    P^{*} = \\frac{r}{k}\n    $$\n    From $\\beta kB - \\delta = 0$, we solve for $B^{*}$:\n    $$\n    B^{*} = \\frac{\\delta}{\\beta k}\n    $$\n    This gives the second equilibrium point, where bacteria and phage coexist:\n    $$\n    (B_2^{*}, P_2^{*}) = \\left(\\frac{\\delta}{\\beta k}, \\frac{r}{k}\\right)\n    $$\n    Since all parameters $r, k, \\beta, \\delta$ are strictly positive, both $B_2^{*}$ and $P_2^{*}$ are positive, making this a biologically feasible equilibrium.\n\n**Task 2: Local Stability Analysis**\n\nTo determine the local stability of these equilibria, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system, $J(B, P)$. The functions are $f(B, P) = rB - kPB$ and $g(B, P) = \\beta kPB - \\delta P$.\nThe Jacobian is:\n$$\nJ(B, P) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial B} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial P} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial B} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial P} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} r - kP & -kB \\\\ \\beta kP & \\beta kB - \\delta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this matrix at each equilibrium point and analyze its eigenvalues.\n\n1.  **Stability of $(B_1^{*}, P_1^{*}) = (0, 0)$**:\n    $$\n    J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} r - 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 - \\delta \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} r & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\delta \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    The eigenvalues $(\\lambda)$ are the diagonal entries: $\\lambda_1 = r$ and $\\lambda_2 = -\\delta$.\n    Since $r > 0$ and $\\delta > 0$, we have one positive and one negative eigenvalue. This indicates that the equilibrium at $(0, 0)$ is an unstable **saddle point**. Trajectories near the origin are repelled along the bacterial axis (B-axis) and attracted along the phage axis (P-axis).\n\n2.  **Stability of $(B_2^{*}, P_2^{*}) = (\\frac{\\delta}{\\beta k}, \\frac{r}{k})$**:\n    $$\n    J\\left(\\frac{\\delta}{\\beta k}, \\frac{r}{k}\\right) = \\begin{pmatrix} r - k\\left(\\frac{r}{k}\\right) & -k\\left(\\frac{\\delta}{\\beta k}\\right) \\\\ \\beta k\\left(\\frac{r}{k}\\right) & \\beta k\\left(\\frac{\\delta}{\\beta k}\\right) - \\delta \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} r - r & -\\frac{\\delta}{\\beta} \\\\ \\beta r & \\delta - \\delta \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\frac{\\delta}{\\beta} \\\\ \\beta r & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    The characteristic equation is $\\det(J - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n    $$\n    \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -\\lambda & -\\frac{\\delta}{\\beta} \\\\ \\beta r & -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (-\\lambda)(-\\lambda) - \\left(-\\frac{\\delta}{\\beta}\\right)(\\beta r) = \\lambda^2 + r\\delta = 0\n    $$\n    Solving for the eigenvalues:\n    $$\n    \\lambda^2 = -r\\delta\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\lambda = \\pm \\sqrt{-r\\delta} = \\pm i\\sqrt{r\\delta}\n    $$\n    The eigenvalues are a pair of purely imaginary complex conjugates. In the linearized system, this corresponds to a **center**. This means that near the coexistence equilibrium, the populations are predicted to undergo sustained oscillations. The equilibrium is neutrally stable.\n\n**Task 3: Derivation of the Critical Phage Density $P_{\\mathrm{crit}}$**\n\nThe final task is to find the phage density, $P_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, that results in a zero net growth rate for the bacteria. The net bacterial growth rate is given by $\\frac{dB}{dt}$. We set this to zero at a positive bacterial density $B>0$.\n$$\n\\frac{dB}{dt} = rB - kPB = 0\n$$\nWe are looking for the value of $P$ that satisfies this condition. Let this value be $P_{\\mathrm{crit}}$.\n$$\nrB - kP_{\\mathrm{crit}}B = 0\n$$\nSince the condition must hold for any positive bacterial density ($B > 0$), we can divide both sides by $B$:\n$$\nr - kP_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $P_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ gives:\n$$\nkP_{\\mathrm{crit}} = r\n$$\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{r}{k}\n$$\nThis expression defines the critical phage density. If the instantaneous phage density $P$ is greater than $P_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, the term $r - kP$ becomes negative, causing the bacterial population to decline ($\\frac{dB}{dt} < 0$). If $P < P_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, the term is positive and the bacterial population grows ($\\frac{dB}{dt} > 0$). Therefore, $P_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{r}{k}$ represents the minimum phage concentration required to suppress bacterial growth within this model, often referred to as the phage density for inundation therapy. It is noteworthy that this value is precisely the phage density at the coexistence equilibrium point.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{r}{k}}$$", "id": "4612344"}, {"introduction": "While understanding population dynamics in a well-mixed environment is crucial, many infections involve bacteria encased in biofilms, which act as physical fortresses.

This is a standard and well-established model in biophysics and microbiology. The reaction term, $-kPB$, represents first-order removal kinetics (since $B$ is constant), which is a valid simplification of Michaelis-Menten kinetics at low substrate (phage) concentrations. The model is based on Fick's second law and mass-action kinetics, which are fundamental principles. The units provided for the constants are dimensionally consistent. The term $kPB$ must have units of concentration per time ($\\mathrm{phage}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$).

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the steady-state concentration profile $P(x)$ and the penetration depth $x_{\\mathrm{pen}}$. At steady state, the concentration does not change with time, which means $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial t} = 0$. The partial differential equation (PDE) simplifies to a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$0 = D_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\frac{d^2 P}{d x^2} - k B P$$\nThis can be rearranged into a standard form:\n$$\\frac{d^2 P}{d x^2} - \\frac{k B}{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}} P = 0$$\nThis is a linear, homogeneous, second-order ODE with constant coefficients. Let us define a characteristic length scale $\\lambda$ such that $\\lambda^{-2} = \\frac{k B}{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$. Then the equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{d^2 P}{d x^2} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} P = 0$$\nThe characteristic equation is $r^2 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} = 0$, which has two real roots, $r_1 = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$ and $r_2 = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$. The general solution is therefore of the form:\n$$P(x) = C_1 \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) + C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nWe apply the boundary conditions to determine the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$. The steady-state boundary conditions are $P(0) = P_0$ and $P(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$.\n\nFrom the condition $P(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$, we analyze the general solution. The term $\\exp(x/\\lambda)$ grows indefinitely as $x \\to \\infty$. To satisfy the boundary condition, its coefficient must be zero, so $C_1 = 0$. The solution simplifies to:\n$$P(x) = C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nNow, we apply the second boundary condition at the surface, $P(0) = P_0$:\n$$P(0) = C_2 \\exp(0) = C_2 = P_0$$\nThus, the steady-state concentration profile is:\n$$P(x) = P_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nwhere $\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{kB}}$.\n\nNext, we find the penetration depth $x_{\\mathrm{pen}}$.
