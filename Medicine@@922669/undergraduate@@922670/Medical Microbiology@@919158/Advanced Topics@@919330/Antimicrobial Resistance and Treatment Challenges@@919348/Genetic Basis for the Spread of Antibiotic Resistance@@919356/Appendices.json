A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe problem asks for the effective per-division rate at which a viable, plasmid-free cell emerges. This is equivalent to finding the joint probability of two sequential events:\n1.  A progeny cell is plasmid-free.\n2.  This plasmid-free cell survives the post-segregational killing mechanism.\n\nLet us define the events formally.\nLet $S$ be the event that a progeny cell is a plasmid-free segregant. From the problem statement, the probability of this event is given as:\n$$P(S) = p = 0.02$$\n\nLet $V$ be the event that a progeny cell is viable (i.e., it survives). We are interested in the survival of a plasmid-free cell. The problem provides the probability of a plasmid-free cell being killed by the TA system. Let $K$ be the event that a plasmid-free cell is killed. The problem gives this as a conditional probability:\n$$P(K|S) = k = 0.9$$\nThe event that a plasmid-free cell is viable, $V$, is the complement of the event that it is killed, $K$, given that it is plasmid-free. Therefore, the probability of a plasmid-free cell surviving is:\n$$P(V|S) = 1 - P(K|S) = 1 - k$$\nSubstituting the given value of $k$:\n$$P(V|S) = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1$$\n\nThe objective is to find the probability that a cell is both plasmid-free and viable. This is the probability of the intersection of events $S$ and $V$, denoted as $P(S \\cap V)$.\n\nThe problem explicitly instructs to use the multiplication rule for probabilities, which states that for any two events $A$ and $B$, the probability of their intersection is $P(A \\cap B) = P(B|A)P(A)$.\nApplying this rule to our defined events $S$ and $V$:\n$$P(S \\cap V) = P(V|S) P(S)$$\nWe have already determined the expressions for the probabilities on the right-hand side. Substituting these expressions gives the symbolic form of the answer:\n$$P(S \\cap V) = (1 - k)p$$\nThis expression represents the effective per-division rate of the emergence of viable, plasmid-free cells.\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided in the problem statement, $p = 0.02$ and $k = 0.9$, into this expression:\n$$P(S \\cap V) = (1 - 0.9) \\times 0.02$$\n$$P(S \\cap V) = 0.1 \\times 0.02$$\n$$P(S \\cap V) = 0.002$$\n\nThus, the effective per-division rate at which a viable, plasmid-free cell emerges is $0.002$.
