The concepts of target occupancy, a critical threshold for efficacy ($\\theta^{*}$), and the use of an affinity constant ($K_M$) to characterize drug-target interaction are fundamental principles in pharmacology and biochemistry. The scenario of a mutation in a target protein leading to a change in $K_M$ and consequently in the $MIC$ is a classic mechanism of acquired drug resistance. The premise is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly stated. It provides all necessary assumptions and definitions to derive the requested relationship and compute the fold-change. The relationships are based on standard biochemical models, ensuring a unique and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. It is free from subjective claims.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. It provides the necessary assumptions (equilibrium approximation, constant $\\theta^{*}$, constant $PBP$ levels) and does not contain contradictory information.\n- **Realism and Feasibility**: The model is a simplification (e.g., assuming equilibrium), but it is a widely used and accepted approximation in pharmacodynamics. A $10$-fold change in an affinity constant due to a mutation is a realistic value observed in biological systems.\n- **Structure and Clarity**: The problem is well-structured, guiding the solver from deriving a general relationship to applying it to a specific case. The terms $MIC$, $K_M$, and $\\theta^{*}$ are clearly defined within the context of the problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically valid, well-posed, and internally consistent. It poses a legitimate question in quantitative biology. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first modeling the drug-target interaction using the law of mass action to derive the fractional occupancy of the $PBP$. This relationship is then used with the definition of the $MIC$ to establish a direct proportionality between $MIC$ and $K_M$. Finally, this proportionality is used to calculate the fold-change in $MIC$ for the given change in $K_M$.\n\nLet $[P]$ represent the concentration of free $PBP$, $[A]$ be the concentration of the antibiotic, and $[PA]$ be the concentration of the acylated, inactive $PBP$-antibiotic complex. The total concentration of $PBP$ is constant and given by $[P]_{total} = [P] + [PA]$.\n\nThe problem states that the interaction can be modeled as a reversible binding equilibrium, described by the law of mass action. The affinity-like parameter is given as the effective Michaelis constant, $K_M$, which in this binding context serves as the dissociation constant.\nThe equilibrium reaction is:\n$$ P + A \\rightleftharpoons PA $$\nThe dissociation constant is defined as:\n$$ K_M = \\frac{[P][A]}{[PA]} $$\nThe fraction of inhibited (bound) $PBPs$, denoted by $\\theta$, is the ratio of the concentration of the complex to the total $PBP$ concentration:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[PA]}{[P]_{total}} = \\frac{[PA]}{[P] + [PA]} $$\nTo express $\\theta$ in terms of $[A]$ and $K_M$, we first rearrange the $K_M$ expression to solve for $[P]$:\n$$ [P] = \\frac{K_M [PA]}{[A]} $$\nSubstituting this into the denominator of the expression for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[PA]}{\\frac{K_M [PA]}{[A]} + [PA]} $$\nAssuming a non-zero concentration of the complex, we can factor out $[PA]$ from the denominator:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[PA]}{[PA] \\left( \\frac{K_M}{[A]} + 1 \\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_M}{[A]} + 1} $$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $[A]$ gives the standard form of the binding isotherm:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[A]}{K_M + [A]} $$\nThe problem defines the $MIC$ as the specific antibiotic concentration, $[A] = MIC$, at which the fraction of inhibited $PBPs$ reaches the critical threshold, $\\theta = \\theta^*$. Substituting these definitions into our derived equation:\n$$ \\theta^* = \\frac{MIC}{K_M + MIC} $$\nWe now solve for $MIC$ to find its dependence on $K_M$.\n$$ \\theta^* (K_M + MIC) = MIC $$\n$$ \\theta^* K_M + \\theta^* MIC = MIC $$\n$$ \\theta^* K_M = MIC - \\theta^* MIC $$\n$$ \\theta^* K_M = MIC (1 - \\theta^*) $$\n$$ MIC = K_M \\left( \\frac{\\theta^*}{1 - \\theta^*} \\right) $$\nSince $\\theta^*$ is a constant for the bacterial species under the given assay conditions, the term $\\left( \\frac{\\theta^*}{1 - \\theta^*} \\right)$ is also a constant. This derivation shows that the $MIC$ is directly proportional to the effective Michaelis constant $K_M$.\n\nNow, we compute the fold-change in $MIC$ for a variant with an altered $K_M$. Let the wild-type parameters be $MIC_{wt}$ and $K_{M,wt}$, and the variant parameters be $MIC_{var}$ and $K_{M,var}$.\nFor the wild-type strain:\n$$ MIC_{wt} = K_{M,wt} \\left( \\frac{\\theta^*}{1 - \\theta^*} \\right) $$\nFor the variant strain:\n$$ MIC_{var} = K_{M,var} \\left( \\frac{\\theta^*}{1 - \\theta^*} \\right) $$\nThe problem states that the variant has a $K_M$ that is $10$-fold higher than the wild-type:\n$$ K_{M,var} = 10 \\cdot K_{M,wt} $$\nThe fold-change in $MIC$ is the ratio of $MIC_{var}$ to $MIC_{wt}$:\n$$ \\frac{MIC_{var}}{MIC_{wt}} = \\frac{K_{M,var} \\left( \\frac{\\theta^*}{1 - \\theta^*} \\right)}{K_{M,wt} \\left( \\frac{\\theta^*}{1 - \\theta^*} \\right)} $$\nThe constant term $\\left( \\frac{\\theta^*}{1 - \\theta^*} \\right)$ cancels, leaving:\n$$ \\frac{MIC_{var}}{MIC_{wt}} = \\frac{K_{M,var}}{K_{M,wt}} $$\nSubstituting the given relationship between the $K_M$ values:\n$$ \\frac{MIC_{var}}{MIC_{wt}} = \\frac{10 \\cdot K_{M,wt}}{K_{M,wt}} = 10 $$\nThus, a $10$-fold increase in $K_M$ results in a $10$-fold increase in the $MIC$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{10}\n$$", "id": "4613095"}, {"introduction": "Bacteria often defeat antibiotics by producing enzymes that chemically inactivate them, such as beta-lactamases that destroy penicillin.
