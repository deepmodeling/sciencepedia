The IgG architecture consists of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains. Each heavy chain comprises one Variable Heavy (V_H) domain, followed by Constant Heavy domains $C_{H1}$, hinge, $C_{H2}$, and $C_{H3}$, whereas each light chain comprises one Variable Light (V_L) domain followed by one Constant Light (C_L) domain. Immunoglobulin domains are folded structures stabilized by intrachain disulfide bonds, and additional interchain disulfide bonds join heavy and light chains and the two heavy chains. A disulfide bond is formed by the oxidation of two cysteine residues, so each disulfide bond consumes exactly two cysteines.\n\nConsider a human IgG subclass $1$ (IgG1) in which the two polypeptides are presented as amino acid sequence segments (for schematic mapping only) with the following plausible segment lengths: for each heavy chain, $V_{H}$ is $110$ residues, $C_{H1}$ is $110$ residues, hinge is $15$ residues, $C_{H2}$ is $110$ residues, and $C_{H3}$ is $110$ residues; for each light chain, $V_{L}$ is $110$ residues and $C_{L}$ is $110$ residues. Map these segments to the structural features $V_{H}$, $V_{L}$, $C_{H1}$–$C_{H3}$, $C_{L}$, and hinge.

No units are required.", "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Molecule**: Human Immunoglobulin G, subclass $1$ (IgG1).\n- **Structure**: Two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains.\n- **Heavy Chain Components**: One Variable Heavy ($V_H$) domain, one Constant Heavy domain $1$ ($C_{H1}$), a hinge region, one Constant Heavy domain $2$ ($C_{H2}$), and one Constant Heavy domain $3$ ($C_{H3}$).\n- **Light Chain Components**: One Variable Light ($V_L$) domain and one Constant Light ($C_L$) domain.\n- **Disulfide Bond Chemistry**: $1$ disulfide bond is formed from $2$ cysteine residues.\n- **Segment Lengths**: The problem provides segment lengths for heavy chain components ($V_{H}$: $110$, $C_{H1}$: $110$, hinge: $15$, $C_{H2}$: $110$, $C_{H3}$: $110$) and light chain components ($V_{L}$: $110$, $C_{L}$: $110$). This information is noted but will be assessed for relevance.\n- **Disulfide Bond Rules**:\n    1.  Each immunoglobulin domain (variable or constant) contains exactly one intrachain disulfide bond.\n    2.  Each light chain is linked to its corresponding heavy chain by one interchain disulfide bond.\n    3.  Human IgG1 contains $2$ inter-heavy disulfide bonds within the hinge region.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The description of IgG1 structure, including the types and arrangement of polypeptide chains ($2$ heavy, $2$ light), the domain organization ($V_H, V_L, C_{H1-3}, C_L$), the presence of a hinge region, and the role of disulfide bonds, is entirely consistent with established principles of immunology and protein biochemistry. The specified disulfide bond pattern for human IgG1 (one intrachain per domain, two inter-heavy chain, one heavy-light per pair) is a canonical representation found in scientific literature. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness and Completeness**: The problem asks for a definite quantity, the total number of cysteine residues, and provides a complete set of rules to calculate it. The relationship between disulfide bonds and cysteine residues is explicitly defined ($1$ bond = $2$ cysteines). The number of intrachain and interchain bonds is fully specified by the rules. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. The segment lengths are extraneous to the calculation but do not invalidate the problem; they are plausible distractor values.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in clear, factual, and unbiased scientific language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-defined calculation based on canonical biological facts. A step-by-step solution can be constructed.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to calculate the total number of cysteine residues in a single, intact human IgG1 molecule based on the provided structural rules.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the number of disulfide bonds and the number of cysteine residues. As stated, each disulfide bond is formed from the oxidation of two cysteine residues. Therefore, the total number of cysteine residues, $N_{\\text{cysteine}}$, is twice the total number of disulfide bonds, $N_{\\text{bonds}}$.\n$$N_{\\text{cysteine}} = 2 \\times N_{\\text{bonds}}$$\nThe total number of disulfide bonds, $N_{\\text{bonds}}$, is the sum of all intrachain bonds ($N_{\\text{intrachain}}$) and all interchain bonds ($N_{\\text{interchain}}$).\n$$N_{\\text{bonds}} = N_{\\text{intrachain}} + N_{\\text{interchain}}$$\n\nWe will calculate each component separately.\n\n**1. Calculation of Intrachain Disulfide Bonds ($N_{\\text{intrachain}}$)**\nThe problem states that each immunoglobulin domain, whether variable or constant, contains exactly one intrachain disulfide bond. We must therefore count the total number of such domains in the IgG1 molecule.\n\n- An IgG1 molecule has $2$ identical heavy chains and $2$ identical light chains.\n- Each heavy chain consists of the domains $V_H$, $C_{H1}$, $C_{H2}$, and $C_{H3}$. The hinge is a flexible region and is not classified as a canonical immunoglobulin domain in this context. Thus, each heavy chain contains $4$ immunoglobulin domains.\n- Total domains in the two heavy chains = $2 \\text{ chains} \\times 4 \\text{ domains/chain} = 8 \\text{ domains}$.\n- Each light chain consists of the domains $V_L$ and $C_L$. Thus, each light chain contains $2$ immunoglobulin domains.\n- Total domains in the two light chains = $2 \\text{ chains} \\times 2 \\text{ domains/chain} = 4 \\text{ domains}$.\n\nThe total number of immunoglobulin domains in one IgG1 molecule is the sum of domains from all chains:\n$$N_{\\text{domains}} = 8 + 4 = 12 \\text{ domains}$$\nSince each domain has one intrachain disulfide bond:\n$$N_{\\text{intrachain}} = N_{\\text{domains}} = 12 \\text{ bonds}$$\n\n**2. Calculation of Interchain Disulfide Bonds ($N_{\\text{interchain}}$)**\nThe problem specifies the number and location of interchain bonds. These bonds link the separate polypeptide chains together.\n\n- **Heavy-Light (H-L) Bonds**: \"Each light chain is linked to its corresponding heavy chain by one interchain disulfide bond.\" Since there are two light chains, there are $2$ such bonds in total.\n- **Heavy-Heavy (H-H) Bonds**: \"Human IgG1 contains $2$ inter-heavy disulfide bonds within the hinge region.\"\n\nThe total number of interchain disulfide bonds is the sum of these two types:\n$$N_{\\text{interchain}} = 2 \\text{ (H-L bonds)} + 2 \\text{ (H-H bonds)} = 4 \\text{ bonds}$$\n\n**3. Calculation of Total Cysteines**\nNow we can find the total number of disulfide bonds, $N_{\\text{bonds}}$:\n$$N_{\\text{bonds}} = N_{\\text{intrachain}} + N_{\\text{interchain}} = 12 + 4 = 16 \\text{ bonds}$$\nFinally, we calculate the total number of cysteine residues, $N_{\\text{cysteine}}$, required to form these $16$ bonds:\n$$N_{\\text{cysteine}} = 2 \\times N_{\\text{bonds}} = 2 \\times 16 = 32$$\n\nThe amino acid sequence lengths provided for each domain and the hinge region are consistent with typical values but are not required for the calculation, which depends only on the count of domains and the specified number of interchain bonds. The total number of cysteine residues is $32$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{32}\n$$", "id": "4604522"}, {"introduction": "An antibody's bivalent structure provides a profound functional advantage that a simple summing of parts cannot explain. This practice delves into the crucial distinction between *affinity*, the strength of a single binding-site interaction, and *avidity*, the dramatically enhanced overall binding strength from multiple simultaneous interactions.

Therefore, the only source of IgG production is the residual TI pathway.\n$$\nP_{G}^{\\mathrm{defect}} = r_{G,\\mathrm{TI}} \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{total}}\n$$\nUsing the given value $r_{G,\\mathrm{TI}} = 0.02$, we have:\n$$\nP_{G}^{\\mathrm{defect}} = 0.02\\, P_{\\mathrm{total}}\n$$\n\n**Production of IgM in the CD40L-deficient state ($P_{M}^{\\mathrm{defect}}$):**\nIn the deficient state, the total IgM production is the sum of three components:\n$1$. The baseline TI IgM production, which is unchanged: $P_{\\mathrm{TI},M} = 0.10\\,P_{\\mathrm{total}}$.\n$2$. The fraction of the T-dependent response that would have been IgM even in a healthy individual (the unswitched plasmablasts): $(1-s)P_{\\mathrm{total}}$.\n$3$. The fraction of the T-dependent response that fails to undergo CSR and defaults to IgM production: $s\\,P_{\\mathrm{total}}$.\n\nThe problem states that \"all CSR that would have occurred from the $s\\,P_{\\mathrm{total}}$ pool fails... and these... contribute as IgM-secreting plasmablasts instead\". This means the entire antigen-driven T-dependent response, which has a total rate of $(1-s)P_{\\mathrm{total}} + s\\,P_{\\mathrm{total}} = P_{\\mathrm{total}}$, now secretes only IgM.\n\nThus, the total IgM production rate in the deficient state is the sum of the T-dependent component (which is now all IgM) and the baseline TI component:\n$$\nP_{M}^{\\mathrm{defect}} = P_{\\mathrm{total}} + P_{\\mathrm{TI},M} = P_{\\mathrm{total}} + 0.10\\,P_{\\mathrm{total}} = 1.10\\,P_{\\mathrm{total}}\n$$\n\n**Calculation of the Ratio $R$:**\nNow we substitute the expressions for the production rates and the given half-lives into the ratio formula:\n$$\nR = \\frac{(1.10\\,P_{\\mathrm{total}}) \\cdot t_{1/2,M}}{(0.02\\,P_{\\mathrm{total}}) \\cdot t_{1/2,G}}\n$$\nThe $P_{\\mathrm{total}}$ terms cancel, as expected.\n$$\nR = \\frac{1.10 \\cdot t_{1/2,M}}{0.02 \\cdot t_{1/2,G}}\n$$\nWe are given $t_{1/2,M} = 5$ days and $t_{1/2,G} = 21$ days.\n$$\nR = \\frac{1.10 \\times 5}{0.02 \\times 21} = \\frac{5.5}{0.42}\n$$\nTo express this as an exact fraction, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $100$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{5.5 \\times 100}{0.42 \\times 100} = \\frac{550}{42}\n$$\nFinally, we simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $2$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{550 \\div 2}{42 \\div 2} = \\frac{275}{21}\n$$\nThe number $21$ has prime factors $3$ and $7$. The sum of the digits of $275$ is $2+7+5 = 14$, which is not divisible by $3$. Also, $275 = 7 \\times 39 + 2$, so it is not divisible by $7$. Therefore, the fraction is in its simplest form.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{275}{21}}\n$$", "id": "4604455"}]}
