This is the probability of *not* passing positive selection.\n$$P(\\neg A) = 80\\% = 0.8$$\nThe probability of passing positive selection is therefore the complement:\n$$P(A) = 1 - P(\\neg A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$$\n\nNext, we consider negative selection. The problem states that among those thymocytes that pass positive selection, $10\\%$ fail negative selection. This is a conditional probability. It is the probability of failing negative selection *given* that positive selection has been passed.\n$$P(\\neg B | A) = 10\\% = 0.1$$\nThe probability of passing negative selection, given that positive selection has been passed, is the complement of this conditional probability:\n$$P(B | A) = 1 - P(\\neg B | A) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9$$\n\nOur goal is to find the probability of a thymocyte passing both steps, $P(A \\cap B)$. Using the definition of conditional probability, we know that:\n$$P(B | A) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(A)}$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for the joint probability $P(A \\cap B)$ gives the multiplication rule:\n$$P(A \\cap B) = P(B | A) \\times P(A)$$\nWe can now substitute the probabilities we have determined:\n$$P(A \\cap B) = 0.9 \\times 0.2$$\n$$P(A \\cap B) = 0.18$$\nThis probability represents the fraction of the initial thymocyte population that survives both selection steps to become mature T cells.\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a simplified fraction.
