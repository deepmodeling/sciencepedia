The process is stipulated to be one-dimensional, unbiased Brownian diffusion, and the framework is the mean-square displacement (MSD).\n\nThe fundamental relationship for one-dimensional diffusion, derived by Einstein, relates the mean-square displacement, $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$, to the diffusion coefficient, $D$, and time, $t$:\n$$\n\\langle x^2 \\rangle = 2Dt\n$$\nThe \"characteristic traversal time\" is the time at which the particle's root-mean-square displacement, $\\sqrt{\\langle x^2 \\rangle}$, is equal to the thickness of the layer, $d$. This is equivalent to setting the mean-square displacement equal to the square of the thickness, $d^2$.\n$$\n\\langle x^2 \\rangle = d^2\n$$\nBy substituting this condition into the diffusion equation, we can solve for the characteristic time $t$:\n$$\nd^2 = 2Dt\n$$\nSolving for $t$ yields the general expression for the characteristic traversal time:\n$$\nt = \\frac{d^2}{2D}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the characteristic time as required by the problem.\n\nNext, we compute the specific times $t_{0}$ and $t_{1}$ corresponding to the diffusion coefficients $D_{0}$ and $D_{1}$, respectively.
