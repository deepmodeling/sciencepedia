The NK cell integrates signals from activating and inhibitory receptors. The net signal, $S_{net}$, can be expressed as the difference between the total activating signal, $S_a$, and the total inhibitory signal, $S_i$.\n$$S_{net} = S_a - S_i$$\nThe activating signal $S_a$ is given by the product of the activating signaling weight per receptor, $w_a$, and the number of occupied activating receptors, $N_a$. The number of occupied receptors is the total number of receptors, $R_a$, multiplied by the fractional occupancy, $f_a$.\n$$S_a = w_a N_a = w_a R_a f_a$$\nSimilarly, the inhibitory signal $S_i$ is given by:\n$$S_i = w_i N_i = w_i R_i f_i$$\nHere, $f_a$ and $f_i$ are the fractional occupancies of the activating and inhibitory receptors, respectively.

The parameters are physiologically consistent with an inflammatory state. We can therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe first part of the problem requires the derivation of the expression for the net volume flux of water across a capillary wall. This expression is known as the Starling equation. We will derive it from the stated fundamental principles.\n\nLet $J_v$ be the net volume flux of fluid moving from the capillary into the interstitial space. This flux is driven by the net pressure gradient across the capillary wall. This net pressure is a sum of hydrostatic and oncotic pressure gradients.\n\n1.  **Hydrostatic Pressure Gradient**: Hydrostatic pressure is the mechanical pressure exerted by the fluid. The capillary hydrostatic pressure, $P_c$, tends to push fluid out of the capillary, while the interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure, $P_i$, tends to push fluid back in. The net hydrostatic pressure gradient, $\\Delta P$, driving fluid out is the difference between these two pressures:\n    $$ \\Delta P = P_c - P_i $$\n\n2.  **Oncotic Pressure Gradient**: Oncotic pressure, also known as colloid osmotic pressure, is the osmotic pressure generated by large molecules, primarily plasma proteins, that cannot easily cross the capillary wall. Following the van't Hoff relation, this pressure is proportional to the solute (protein) concentration. The capillary oncotic pressure, $\\pi_c$, due to proteins within the capillary, tends to draw water into the capillary. The interstitial oncotic pressure, $\\pi_i$, due to proteins that have leaked into the interstitial fluid, tends to draw water out of the capillary (or more accurately, reduces the inward pull from $\\pi_c$). The net oncotic pressure gradient, $\\Delta\\pi$, drawing fluid into the capillary is:\n    $$ \\Delta\\pi = \\pi_c - \\pi_i $$\n\n3.  **Effective Oncotic Pressure and the Reflection Coefficient**: The capillary wall is not perfectly impermeable to proteins; it is \"partially protein-reflecting\". The reflection coefficient, $\\sigma$, is a dimensionless factor between $0$ and $1$ that corrects for this leakiness. If $\\sigma = 1$, the membrane is completely impermeable to proteins, and the full oncotic pressure gradient is effective. If $\\sigma = 0$, the membrane is freely permeable, and the oncotic pressure gradient has no effect on water movement. For a partially permeable membrane, the effective oncotic pressure gradient that opposes filtration is $\\sigma \\Delta\\pi$.\n\n4.  **Net Filtration Pressure**: The total or net pressure driving filtration, $P_{net}$, is the hydrostatic pressure gradient pushing fluid out minus the effective oncotic pressure gradient pulling fluid in.\n    $$ P_{net} = \\Delta P - \\sigma \\Delta\\pi = (P_c - P_i) - \\sigma(\\pi_c - \\pi_i) $$\n    A positive $P_{net}$ indicates net filtration (fluid moving out of the capillary), while a negative $P_{net}$ indicates net absorption (fluid moving into the capillary).\n\n5.  **Net Fluid Flux**: Based on the principle of mass conservation for water flow across a porous barrier, the net volume flux, $J_v$, is proportional to the net filtration pressure. The constant of proportionality is the filtration coefficient, $K_f$, which incorporates the hydraulic conductivity and surface area of the capillary network.\n    $$ J_v = K_f P_{net} $$\n    Substituting the expression for $P_{net}$, we arrive at the Starling equation for transcapillary fluid flux:\n    $$ J_v = K_f [ (P_c - P_i) - \\sigma(\\pi_c - \\pi_i) ] $$\n    This completes the derivation.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires calculating the net edema volume accumulated over a specified duration.
