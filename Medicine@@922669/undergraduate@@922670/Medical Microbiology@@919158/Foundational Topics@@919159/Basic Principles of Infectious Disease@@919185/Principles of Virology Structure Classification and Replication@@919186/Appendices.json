The use of the Poisson distribution to model the number of viral particles infecting a cell given a certain MOI is a standard and fundamental concept in quantitative virology. The underlying assumptions are appropriate for this model. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary information provided to derive the requested quantities. The terminology is precise and objective. The questions are logically constructed and address core principles of viral infection kinetics. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem asks for three distinct but related components: a general derivation, a specific calculation, and a qualitative justification.\n\n**1. General expression for the fraction of infected cells**\n\nThe fraction of cells that are infected corresponds to the probability that a randomly selected cell from the population has been infected by at least one infectious viral particle. According to the problem statement, the number of infectious units, $k$, that adsorb to a cell follows a Poisson distribution with mean $m$:\n$$P(k) = \\exp(-m) \\frac{m^k}{k!}, \\quad k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$$\nA cell is considered \"infected\" if it receives one or more infectious units, which corresponds to the event $k \\geq 1$. The fraction of infected cells is therefore $P(k \\geq 1)$.\n\nIt is most straightforward to calculate this probability by considering the complementary event: a cell is *not* infected. A cell is not infected if and only if it receives exactly zero infectious units, which corresponds to the event $k=0$. The probability of this event is $P(k=0)$.\n\nUsing the given Poisson formula for $k=0$:\n$$P(k=0) = \\exp(-m) \\frac{m^0}{0!}$$\nBy definition, any non-zero number raised to the power of $0$ is $1$ (i.e., $m^0 = 1$), and the factorial of $0$ is also $1$ (i.e., $0! = 1$). Substituting these values gives:\n$$P(k=0) = \\exp(-m) \\frac{1}{1} = \\exp(-m)$$\nThis expression, $P(0)$, represents the fraction of cells that remain uninfected.\n\nSince the set of all possible outcomes is that a cell is either uninfected ($k=0$) or infected ($k \\geq 1$), the sum of their probabilities must be $1$:\n$$P(k=0) + P(k \\geq 1) = 1$$\nTherefore, the fraction of cells that are infected, $P(k \\geq 1)$, is given by:\n$$P(k \\geq 1) = 1 - P(k=0)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(k=0)$, we arrive at the general expression for the fraction of infected cells in terms of the MOI, $m$:\n$$P(\\text{infected}) = 1 - \\exp(-m)$$\n\n**2. Calculation for an MOI of $m=2$**\n\nTo find the fraction of infected cells for an experiment conducted at an MOI of $m=2$, we substitute $m=2$ into the general expression derived above:\n$$P(\\text{infected}) \\rvert_{m=2} = 1 - \\exp(-2)$$\nThis is the exact analytical expression for the fraction.\n\n**3. Effect of increasing MOI on infection synchrony**\n\n\"Synchrony of infection initiation\" refers to the degree to which individual infected cells in a population begin the viral replication process at the same time. For a non-enveloped, positive-sense RNA virus, the first major step of replication post-entry is the translation of the viral genomic RNA by the host cell's ribosomes to produce viral proteins, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.\n\nThe initiation of this process is a stochastic event. If a cell is infected with a single virion ($k=1$), the time until the first successful translation event occurs is governed by a certain probability distribution. If a cell is infected with multiple virions ($k>1$), there are $k$ independent viral genomes, each with a chance to initiate replication. The time to the *first* successful event in the cell is the minimum of $k$ independent, identically distributed random time variables. Statistically, the expected time for the first event to occur decreases as $k$ increases.\n\nNow, consider the effect of the MOI, $m$, on the entire cell population.\n- At a **low MOI** (e.g., $m \\ll 1$), the fraction of infected cells is low ($1-\\exp(-m) \\approx m$). Among the infected cells, the vast majority are infected by only a single particle ($k=1$), since $P(k=1) \\approx m\\exp(-m)$ and $P(k=2) \\approx \\frac{m^2}{2}\\exp(-m)$, making $P(k=2) \\ll P(k=1)$. Because most infected cells contain only one viral genome, the initiation of replication across the population will be relatively synchronous, with variance determined primarily by the intrinsic stochasticity of a single genome initiating replication.\n- At a **high MOI** (e.g., $m > 1$), the fraction of uninfected cells, $\\exp(-m)$, is small, and cells are infected with a wide range of particle numbers, $k$, described by the Poisson distribution. For example, at $m=5$, cells will be infected with a distribution of particles centered around $k=5$. There will be significant populations of cells with $k=3, 4, 5, 6, 7$, etc.\n\nThis heterogeneity in the number of infecting particles per cell ($k$) across the population is the key to asynchrony. A cell infected with $k=10$ particles will, on average, begin replication sooner than a cell infected with $k=2$ particles. Because a high MOI creates a population of infected cells with a broad distribution of $k$ values, it also creates a broad distribution of replication initiation times. The time window between the earliest-starting cell (likely one with a large $k$) and the latest-starting cell (likely one with a small $k$) widens.\n\nTherefore, from first principles, **increasing the MOI ($m$) decreases the synchrony of infection initiation** across the population of infected cells. While the average infection might appear to start faster, the range of start times becomes larger, resulting in a more asynchronous infection process.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1 - \\exp(-2)}$$", "id": "4668820"}, {"introduction": "A cornerstone of virology is the ability to measure the concentration of infectious virus, a value known as the titer. The plaque assay is the classic method for this, where each infectious virus particle ideally forms a visible plaque on a cell monolayer.

Let $V$ denote the inoculated volume in milliliters, $D$ denote the dilution factor applied to the sample prior to plating, $E$ denote the plating efficiency (the probability that an infectious unit yields a visible plaque), and $N$ denote the observed plaque count.

Accounting for plating efficiency, the expected number of plaques is $\\lambda = EVDT$.

This model requires the *actual* multiplicity of infection ($m$), which is the average number of phage particles that have adsorbed per cell, not the *applied* multiplicity of infection ($m_{\\text{app}}$).\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial concentration of phage added to the culture, $P_{\\text{applied}}$.
