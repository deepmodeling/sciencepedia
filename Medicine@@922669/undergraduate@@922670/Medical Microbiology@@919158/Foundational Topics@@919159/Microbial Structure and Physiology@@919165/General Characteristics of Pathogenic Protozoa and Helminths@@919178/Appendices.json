An ellipsoid is defined by its three mutually perpendicular semi-axes, conventionally denoted as $a$, $b$, and $c$. The volume, $V$, is given by the formula:\n$$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi abc$$\n\nThe problem provides the necessary dimensions to determine the three semi-axes.\n\n1.  The major diameter in the imaging plane is given as $120\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The corresponding semi-axis, let us call it $a$, is half of this diameter:\n    $$a = \\frac{120\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{2} = 60\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n\n2.  The minor diameter in the imaging plane is given as $60\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The corresponding semi-axis, let us call it $b$, is half of this diameter:\n    $$b = \\frac{60\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{2} = 30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n\n3.  The third semi-axis, corresponding to the thickness along the unobserved dimension, is given directly as $c$:\n    $$c = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these semi-axis lengths into the volume formula for an ellipsoid:\n$$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (60\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m})(30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m})(50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m})$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the product of the semi-axes:\n$$(60)(30)(50) = (1800)(50) = 90000$$\nThe units become cubic micrometers, $\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{3}$.\n\nSo, the exact volume is:\n$$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (90000)\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{3} = 4 \\times 30000 \\times \\pi\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{3} = 120000\\pi\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{3}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final result to be rounded to four significant figures.

The fifth digit is $9$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we must round up the fourth digit. Rounding the $9$ in the thousands place up results in a carry-over:\n-   $3769...$ becomes $3770...$\nThe number, expressed to four significant figures, is $377000$.
