This first practice challenges you to think like a diagnostic microbiologist, reasoning from the first principles of dye chemistry and optical physics to understand why. By diagnosing the shortcomings of the Gram stain for this purpose, you will learn to select and justify an appropriate alternative method, such as negative staining, to visualize the capsule as a clear halo against a stained background [@problem_id:4616297].", "problem": "A clinical isolate is suspected to be encapsulated based on its mucoid colony morphology and resistance to desiccation, but repeated Gram staining does not reveal any capsular structures in bright-field microscopy. You are asked to reason from first principles of dye chemistry and optical contrast to explain this observation and then to choose a single staining protocol that will reveal the capsule without introducing confounding signals from the cell wall. Your explanation and chosen protocol must respect the following constraints: the capsule is a hydrated polymer layer external to the cell wall, predominantly composed of polysaccharides or polypeptides with few strongly ionizable groups; basic dyes are cationic and bind to negatively charged cellular components; acidic dyes are anionic and are excluded by negatively charged surfaces; and bright-field contrast depends on differences in refractive index $n$ and absorption between adjacent regions, with the optical path length given by $n \\times t$ where $t$ is thickness.\n\nWhich option best combines a correct mechanistic explanation for why Gram staining typically fails to visualize capsules with a scientifically sound, stepwise protocol that exploits refractive index differences or negative contrast to reveal a capsule without confounding cell wall signals?\n\nA. Explanation: Gram staining fails because the capsule is highly negatively charged and therefore repels the cationic crystal violet, while the ethanol step removes any residual stain from the capsule. Protocol: Mix a bacterial suspension with India ink, heat-fix the smear to adhere cells, rinse liberally with water, and counterstain with safranin; visualize the capsule as a halo.\n\nB. Explanation: Gram staining fails solely because the iodine does not penetrate the capsule; extending the mordant step forces iodine into the capsule. Protocol: Perform a modified Gram stain with prolonged iodine exposure, then decolorize aggressively with ethanol and counterstain with safranin; the capsule will retain the crystal violet–iodine complex and appear purple around the cell.\n\nC. Explanation: Gram staining fails because capsules are waxy and require phenolic dyes driven in by heat. Protocol: Use the acid-fast method with carbol fuchsin and heat, decolorize with acid alcohol, and counterstain with methylene blue; the capsule will be red while the background is blue.\n\nD. Explanation: Gram staining targets peptidoglycan by forming a crystal violet–iodine complex retained in thick cell walls; capsules are hydrated, neutrally to weakly charged polymer layers with $n_{\\text{capsule}} \\approx n_{\\text{water}}$ that exclude many dyes and collapse upon heat or dehydration, so they neither bind the complex nor survive the fixation and wash steps. Protocol: Perform a negative capsule stain using Congo red (an acidic dye) to stain the background and Maneval’s solution to stain the cells without heat fixation or water rinses: place a small drop of Congo red on a clean slide, emulsify a tiny amount of the bacterial colony in the dye, spread a thin film and allow it to air-dry gently without heat, flood with Maneval’s solution for a short period, then gently wick off excess without water. Under bright-field, the background appears dark, the cell body is colored, and the capsule is a clear, refractile halo produced by $n$ and absorption differences, unconfounded by cell wall signals.", "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in microbiology, pertaining to the principles of microscopy and bacterial staining. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   A clinical isolate is suspected to be encapsulated due to its mucoid colony morphology and resistance to desiccation.\n-   Repeated Gram staining does not reveal any capsular structures under bright-field microscopy.\n-   The capsule is a hydrated polymer layer external to the cell wall.\n-   The capsule is predominantly composed of polysaccharides or polypeptides with few strongly ionizable groups.\n-   Basic dyes are cationic and bind to negatively charged cellular components.\n-   Acidic dyes are anionic and are excluded by negatively charged surfaces.\n-   Bright-field contrast depends on differences in refractive index $n$ and absorption between adjacent regions.\n-   Optical path length is given by the product of refractive index and thickness, $n \\times t$.\n-   The task is to explain the failure of Gram staining for capsule visualization and choose a single, non-confounding protocol to reveal the capsule.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically sound. The description of a bacterial capsule as a hydrated, often non-ionic or weakly acidic polysaccharide layer is accurate. The link between mucoid colonies, desiccation resistance, and encapsulation is a fundamental concept in microbiology. The principles of dye chemistry (cationic vs. anionic dyes) and optical physics (bright-field contrast, refractive index) are correctly stated. The central problem—the failure of Gram staining to visualize these structures—is a classic issue encountered in diagnostic laboratories. The problem is well-posed, asking for a mechanistic explanation and a procedural solution based on the provided principles. It is free from ambiguity, subjectivity, or scientific fallacies.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed by deriving an explanation and evaluating the proposed protocols.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\n**1. Mechanistic Explanation for Gram Staining Failure**\n\nThe Gram stain procedure is designed to differentiate bacteria based on the structure of their cell walls, specifically the thickness of the peptidoglycan layer. It is not optimized for visualizing external, delicate structures like capsules. Its failure to reveal capsules can be explained by three primary factors derived from the given principles:\n\n*   **Electrochemical Interaction (Dye Binding):** The primary stain, crystal violet, is a basic (cationic) dye. It binds effectively to negatively charged components like nucleic acids and peptidoglycan. The problem states the capsule has \"few strongly ionizable groups,\" meaning it is largely electrically neutral or, at best, weakly anionic. Consequently, the cationic crystal violet dye has very low affinity for the capsule and does not stain it effectively. The capsule essentially remains colorless.\n*   **Optical Properties (Contrast):** Capsules are \"hydrated polymer layer[s]\". This means they are composed mostly of water, with their refractive index, $n_{\\text{capsule}}$, being very close to that of the surrounding aqueous medium or mounting fluid, $n_{\\text{water}}$. In bright-field microscopy, contrast is generated by differences in refractive index and light absorption. Since the capsule is unstained (low absorption) and has a refractive index similar to the background, the difference in optical path length, $(n_{\\text{capsule}} - n_{\\text{water}}) \\times t_{\\text{capsule}}$, is minimal. This results in the capsule being transparent and invisible against the bright background.\n*   **Structural Integrity (Physical Disruption):** The standard Gram stain protocol involves heat-fixing the bacterial smear to the slide and using alcohol or an acetone-alcohol mixture for decolorization. Heat causes drastic dehydration, which will cause the delicate, highly hydrated capsule to shrink, collapse, or detach from the cell. The alcohol-based decolorizer is also a potent dehydrating agent and can dissolve or strip away the polysaccharide matrix. Therefore, the very procedure of Gram staining physically destroys the structure one might wish to see.\n\nIn summary, the Gram stain fails because the capsule (1) does not bind the stain, (2) is optically transparent, and (3) is destroyed by the fixation and washing steps.\n\n**2. Requirements for a Valid Capsule Staining Protocol**\n\nTo successfully visualize a capsule, a protocol must circumvent the issues above:\n*   It must not rely on the capsule itself taking up a stain. A negative staining approach, where the background is stained, is ideal.\n*   It must preserve the capsule's hydrated structure. This means **no heat-fixing** and avoiding harsh dehydrating agents like alcohol or harsh water rinses. Gentle air-drying is required.\n*   It should enhance contrast, for example, by staining the background and/or the cell body, leaving the capsule as a clear, unstained halo in between.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Explanation: Gram staining fails because the capsule is highly negatively charged and therefore repels the cationic crystal violet, while the ethanol step removes any residual stain from the capsule. Protocol: Mix a bacterial suspension with India ink, heat-fix the smear to adhere cells, rinse liberally with water, and counterstain with safranin; visualize the capsule as a halo.**\n\n*   **Analysis of Explanation:** The premise that the capsule is \"highly negatively charged\" is factually incorrect and contradicts the problem statement's given that it has \"few strongly ionizable groups.\" If it were highly negative, it would strongly attract and bind the cationic crystal violet, not repel it. This part of the explanation is fundamentally flawed.\n*   **Analysis of Protocol:** Using India ink for a negative stain is a valid concept. However, the protocol specifies \"heat-fix the smear.\" This step is catastrophic for capsule visualization as it dehydrates and destroys the capsule structure. \"rinse liberally with water\" can also wash away the smear, which is not adhered well without heat.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The explanation is based on a false premise, and the protocol contains a critical, destructive step (heat-fixing).\n\n**B. Explanation: Gram staining fails solely because the iodine does not penetrate the capsule; extending the mordant step forces iodine into the capsule. Protocol: Perform a modified Gram stain with prolonged iodine exposure, then decolorize aggressively with ethanol and counterstain with safranin; the capsule will retain the crystal violet–iodine complex and appear purple around the cell.**\n\n*   **Analysis of Explanation:** Attributing the failure \"solely\" to lack of iodine penetration is an oversimplification and incorrect. The primary issues are the lack of initial dye binding and the physical destruction of the capsule.\n*   **Analysis of Protocol:** This protocol fundamentally misunderstands the problem. It is a modification of the Gram stain, which we have established is unsuitable. Using alcohol (\"decolorize aggressively with ethanol\") remains a destructive step. The premise that the capsule can be forced to retain the crystal violet-iodine complex is incorrect; its non-ionic, porous, and water-soluble nature makes this impossible, especially against an aggressive alcohol wash.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The explanation is flawed, and the proposed protocol would fail to visualize the capsule and would likely destroy it.\n\n**C. Explanation: Gram staining fails because capsules are waxy and require phenolic dyes driven in by heat. Protocol: Use the acid-fast method with carbol fuchsin and heat, decolorize with acid alcohol, and counterstain with methylene blue; the capsule will be red while the background is blue.**\n\n*   **Analysis of Explanation:** The claim that capsules are \"waxy\" is false. This describes the mycolic acid-rich cell walls of *Mycobacterium* species. Bacterial capsules are typically made of polysaccharides or polypeptides, not waxes (complex lipids).\n*   **Analysis of Protocol:** The proposed protocol is the Ziehl-Neelsen or a similar acid-fast stain. This method is specifically designed for organisms with waxy cell walls and is entirely inappropriate for visualizing a typical polysaccharide capsule. The high heat and harsh decolorizer (acid-alcohol) would destroy the capsule.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The explanation mischaracterizes the capsule's chemical nature, and the proposed protocol is for an entirely different type of cell structure.\n\n**D. Explanation: Gram staining targets peptidoglycan by forming a crystal violet–iodine complex retained in thick cell walls; capsules are hydrated, neutrally to weakly charged polymer layers with $n_{\\text{capsule}} \\approx n_{\\text{water}}$ that exclude many dyes and collapse upon heat or dehydration, so they neither bind the complex nor survive the fixation and wash steps. Protocol: Perform a negative capsule stain using Congo red (an acidic dye) to stain the background and Maneval’s solution to stain the cells without heat fixation or water rinses: place a small drop of Congo red on a clean slide, emulsify a tiny amount of the bacterial colony in the dye, spread a thin film and allow it to air-dry gently without heat, flood with Maneval’s solution for a short period, then gently wick off excess without water. Under bright-field, the background appears dark, the cell body is colored, and the capsule is a clear, refractile halo produced by $n$ and absorption differences, unconfounded by cell wall signals.**\n\n*   **Analysis of Explanation:** This explanation is comprehensive and scientifically flawless. It correctly states that Gram staining targets peptidoglycan. It accurately identifies all three key reasons for failure: the capsule's neutral/weak charge (poor dye binding), its high hydration ($n_{\\text{capsule}} \\approx n_{\\text{water}}$ leading to low contrast), and its destruction by heat and dehydration. This aligns perfectly with the derivation from first principles.\n*   **Analysis of Protocol:** This protocol is a standard, correct method for capsule staining (a modified Gin's or Anthony's method). It uses an acidic dye (Congo red) for negative contrast of the background. Crucially, it specifies \"air-dry gently without heat\" and avoiding water rinses, thus preserving the delicate capsule structure. Maneval's solution serves as both a fixative (due to its acidity) and a counterstain for the cell body. The described result—a dark background, colored cell, and clear halo—is the exact expected outcome and is achieved by creating contrast through absorption differences while preserving the physical structure. It does not confound cell wall signals as it is not a cell-wall-specific stain.\n*   **Verdict:** **Correct**. Both the explanation and the protocol are scientifically sound, accurate, and directly address the challenges presented in the problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "4616297"}, {"introduction": "Now that we can visualize the capsule, let's consider its physical impact on the cell's interaction with its environment.

The final numerical answer must be the fractional volume only.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound, well-posed, and scientifically grounded. It presents a standard model in biophysics that can be solved using established principles of geometry and transport phenomena.\n\nThe problem consists of two parts. The first is a calculation of the fractional volume of a bacterial capsule. The second is a discussion of mass transport through this capsule.\n\n**Part 1: Fractional Volume Calculation**\n\nThe bacterial cell is modeled as an inner sphere of radius $r$, and the capsule is a spherical shell of thickness $t$ surrounding it. The total structure is a larger sphere of radius $R$.\n\nThe givens are:\n- Cell radius: $r = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$\n- Capsule thickness: $t = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$\n\nThe total radius $R$ is the sum of the cell radius and the capsule thickness:\n$$R = r + t = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m} + 0.2\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m} = 0.7\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$$\n\nThe volume of a sphere with radius $\\rho$ is given by the formula $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi\\rho^3$.\n\nThe volume of the cell itself, $V_{\\text{cell}}$, is the volume of the inner sphere of radius $r$:\n$$V_{\\text{cell}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$$\n\nThe total volume, $V_{\\text{total}}$, is the volume of the entire sphere of radius $R$:\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$$\n\nThe volume of the capsule, $V_{\\text{capsule}}$, is the volume of the total sphere minus the volume of the inner cell. This corresponds to the volume of the spherical shell.\n$$V_{\\text{capsule}} = V_{\\text{total}} - V_{\\text{cell}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3 - \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi(R^3 - r^3)$$\n\nThe problem asks for the fractional volume occupied by the capsule relative to the total volume. Let this fraction be denoted by $F_V$.\n$$F_V = \\frac{V_{\\text{capsule}}}{V_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(R^3 - r^3)}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3}$$\nThe term $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$ cancels, yielding:\n$$F_V = \\frac{R^3 - r^3}{R^3} = 1 - \\frac{r^3}{R^3} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^3$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values for $r$ and $R$:\n$$F_V = 1 - \\left(\\frac{0.5}{0.7}\\right)^3 = 1 - \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$$\nCalculating the cube of the ratio:\n$$\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $F_V$:\n$$F_V = 1 - \\frac{125}{343} = \\frac{343 - 125}{343} = \\frac{218}{343}$$\nTo provide the answer rounded to three significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$F_V \\approx 0.6355685...$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we obtain $0.636$.\n\n**Part 2: Discussion of Mass Transport**\n\nWe are asked to discuss how the spherical-shell geometry affects steady-state mass transport of a small solute, governed by Fick's first law, $J = -D\\,\\nabla C$, compared to a planar slab of identical thickness.\n\nIn a spherical coordinate system with radial symmetry, the gradient operator is $\\nabla = \\frac{d}{d\\rho}\\hat{\\rho}$, where $\\rho$ is the radial coordinate. Fick's law becomes:\n$$J(\\rho) = -D\\frac{dC}{d\\rho}$$\nwhere $J(\\rho)$ is the radial diffusive flux (mass per unit area per unit time) and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, assumed to be constant.\n\nFor steady-state diffusion ($\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t}=0$), the principle of mass conservation requires that the total rate of mass transport, $\\dot{M}$, across any concentric spherical surface within the capsule must be constant. The area of such a surface at radius $\\rho$ is $A(\\rho) = 4\\pi\\rho^2$.\nThe total mass transport rate is the flux multiplied by the area:\n$$\\dot{M} = J(\\rho) A(\\rho) = \\left(-D\\frac{dC}{d\\rho}\\right)(4\\pi\\rho^2) = \\text{constant}$$\nThis gives us a first-order ordinary differential equation for the concentration profile $C(\\rho)$:\n$$\\frac{dC}{d\\rho} = -\\frac{\\dot{M}}{4\\pi D \\rho^2}$$\nTo find the relationship between the concentration difference across the capsule and the mass transport rate, we integrate this equation from the outer surface of the capsule ($\\rho=R$, concentration $C(R)=C_{\\text{bulk}}$) to the inner surface, which is the cell surface ($\\rho=r$, concentration $C(r)=C_{\\text{surface}}$):\n$$\\int_{C_{\\text{bulk}}}^{C_{\\text{surface}}} dC = \\int_{R}^{r} \\left(-\\frac{\\dot{M}}{4\\pi D \\rho^2}\\right) d\\rho$$\n$$C_{\\text{surface}} - C_{\\text{bulk}} = -\\frac{\\dot{M}}{4\\pi D} \\left[-\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\right]_R^r = \\frac{\\dot{M}}{4\\pi D} \\left(\\frac{1}{r} - \\frac{1}{R}\\right)$$\nLet the concentration difference across the capsule be $\\Delta C = C_{\\text{bulk}} - C_{\\text{surface}}$. Rearranging for the mass transport rate $\\dot{M}_{\\text{spherical}}$ gives:\n$$\\dot{M}_{\\text{spherical}} = \\frac{4\\pi D \\Delta C}{\\frac{1}{r} - \\frac{1}{R}} = \\frac{4\\pi D \\Delta C}{\\frac{R-r}{rR}} = 4\\pi D \\frac{rR}{R-r} \\Delta C$$\n\nNow, consider a planar slab of the same thickness, $t = R-r$. In Cartesian coordinates, Fick's law is $J = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}$. For a steady-state process, the flux $J$ is constant. Integrating across the slab thickness $t$ gives $J = D\\frac{\\Delta C}{t}$. The total mass transport rate is $\\dot{M}_{\\text{planar}} = J \\cdot A = A D \\frac{\\Delta C}{t}$, where $A$ is the constant cross-sectional area of the slab.\n\nTo compare the geometries, we must choose an equivalent area $A$ for the planar slab. A physically meaningful choice is the area of the surface to which the solute is being delivered, i.e., the cell surface area $A = 4\\pi r^2$. With this choice:\n$$\\dot{M}_{\\text{planar}} = (4\\pi r^2) D \\frac{\\Delta C}{t} = (4\\pi r^2) D \\frac{\\Delta C}{R-r}$$\n\nThe central point of comparison is the effect of geometry on the transport rate for a given $\\Delta C$ and $D$. We compare $\\dot{M}_{\\text{spherical}}$ and $\\dot{M}_{\\text{planar}}$:\n$$\\frac{\\dot{M}_{\\text{spherical}}}{\\dot{M}_{\\text{planar}}} = \\frac{4\\pi D \\frac{rR}{R-r} \\Delta C}{4\\pi r^2 D \\frac{\\Delta C}{R-r}} = \\frac{rR}{r^2} = \\frac{R}{r}$$\nSince the capsule has a finite thickness, $t>0$, the total radius $R=r+t$ is strictly greater than the cell radius $r$. Therefore, the ratio $\\frac{R}{r} > 1$.\n\nThe discussion concludes as follows:\nThe spherical-shell geometry enhances steady-state mass transport to the cell surface compared to a planar slab of identical thickness and an area equal to the cell's surface area. The enhancement factor is $\\frac{R}{r}$. This phenomenon is a direct consequence of the geometry. In the spherical case, the cross-sectional area for diffusion, $A(\\rho) = 4\\pi\\rho^2$, decreases as the solute diffuses inward from the bulk environment (at radius $R$) to the cell surface (at radius $r$). To maintain a constant total mass flow rate $\\dot{M}$, the flux $J(\\rho) = \\frac{\\dot{M}}{A(\\rho)}$ must increase as $\\rho$ decreases. This \"geometric focusing\" or \"funneling\" effect lowers the overall diffusional resistance of the spherical shell relative to its planar counterpart, where the cross-sectional area and flux are constant. Consequently, for the same concentration driving force, a spherical shell is more efficient at delivering solutes to the central body it encloses.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.636}$$", "id": "4616270"}, {"introduction": "The expression of a capsule can vary significantly between different bacterial strains or under different growth conditions, a factor often linked to virulence.

The key steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Standard Curve Generation**: A standard curve is prepared by reacting known quantities of a standard uronic acid (in this case, glucuronic acid) with the carbazole reagent under conditions identical to the unknown sample. The absorbance of the resulting purple chromophore is measured at a wavelength of $530$ nm for each standard. A plot of blank-corrected absorbance versus the mass of uronic acid yields a straight line, whose slope, $m$, represents the assay's sensitivity in units of absorbance per microgram. The problem states this curve is linear through the origin.\n\n2.  **Sample Preparation and Extraction**: A known number of bacterial cells is harvested from a culture of measured cell density. The capsular polysaccharide material is then extracted from these cells. In this case, a volume of $1.50$ mL of a culture with a density of $1.20 \\times 10^{9}$ cells per mL is used, and the capsule is extracted by heat into a final solution volume of $1.00$ mL.\n\n3.  **Sample Assay**: A small aliquot of the capsule extract must be assayed. To ensure the absorbance falls within the linear range of the standard curve, the extract is first diluted (a 1:10 dilution). A specific volume ($0.500$ mL) of this diluted extract is then subjected to the same chemical reaction as the standards: dehydration in concentrated sulfuric acid followed by reaction with carbazole.\n\n4.  **Spectrophotometric Measurement**: The absorbance of the color developed in the sample reaction tube is measured at the wavelength of maximum absorbance, $530$ nm. A reagent blank, containing all reagents except the uronic acid-containing sample, is also measured to account for any background absorbance from the reagents themselves. The sample's absorbance reading is corrected by subtracting the blank's absorbance.\n\n5.  **Quantification and Normalization**: The mass of uronic acid in the assayed aliquot is determined by dividing the blank-corrected absorbance by the slope of the standard curve, $m$. This mass is then extrapolated back to find the total mass of uronic acid in the original extract by accounting for the dilution factor and the volumes used. Finally, this total polysaccharide mass is normalized to the initial number of cells from which it was extracted, and the result is expressed as mass per a standard number of cells, in this case, per $10^{8}$ cells. A critical assumption, stated in the problem, is that the measured mass of uronic acid serves as an appropriate proxy for the total capsular polysaccharide mass.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Capsule Mass per $10^{8}$ Cells**\n\nWe will now perform the calculation based on the provided data.

The concentration in the diluted extract is $\\frac{\\mu g_{assay}}{V_{assay}}$. The original concentration is this value multiplied by the dilution factor, $D$:\n$$ C_{extract} = D \\times \\left( \\frac{\\mu g_{assay}}{V_{assay}} \\right) = 10 \\times \\left( \\frac{22.0}{0.500} \\right) = 10 \\times 44.0 = 440 $$\nThe concentration of the undiluted extract is $440$ µg/mL.\n\nFifth, we calculate the total mass of uronic acid, $\\mu g_{total}$, in the entire original extract volume, $V_{extract}$:\n$$ \\mu g_{total} = C_{extract} \\times V_{extract} = 440 \\times 1.00 = 440 $$\nThe total mass of uronic acid extracted is $440$ µg.\n\nFinally, we normalize this total mass to the number of cells to find the mass per $10^{8}$ cells, which we denote as $M_{10^8}$. This total mass was extracted from $N_{total} = 1.80 \\times 10^{9}$ cells. The required quantity is:\n$$ M_{10^8} = \\frac{\\mu g_{total}}{N_{total}} \\times 10^{8} = \\frac{440}{1.80 \\times 10^{9}} \\times 10^{8} = \\frac{440}{18.0} $$\n$$ M_{10^8} \\approx 24.444... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The input values ($1.20$, $1.50$, $1.00$, $0.500$, $0.478$, $0.0210$) all have three significant figures, so this is appropriate.\n$$ M_{10^8} = 24.4 $$\nThe final calculated capsule polysaccharide mass is $24.4$ micrograms per $10^8$ cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{24.4}$$", "id": "4616277"}]}
