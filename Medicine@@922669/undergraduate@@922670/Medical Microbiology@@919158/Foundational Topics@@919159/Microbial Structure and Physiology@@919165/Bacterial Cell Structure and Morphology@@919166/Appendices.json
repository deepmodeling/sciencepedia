It is scientifically sound, being based on fundamental principles of solid mechanics applied to a standard biophysical model of a bacterial cell. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and simplifying assumptions clearly stated, allowing for the derivation of a unique and meaningful solution. The provided numerical values for bacterial dimensions are realistic and internally consistent with the thin-wall assumption.\n\nThe first step is to derive the functional dependence of the circumferential stress, also known as hoop stress, $\\sigma_{\\theta}$, on the internal turgor pressure $P$, the cylinder radius $r$, and the wall thickness $t$. We are instructed to derive this from mechanical equilibrium, not to use a pre-existing formula.\n\nConsider a segment of the thin-walled cylindrical shell of length $L$. To find the circumferential stress, we imagine cutting this cylinder longitudinally, along a plane that includes the central axis. We then analyze the force balance on one of the resulting halves of the cylinder.\n\nTwo primary forces act on this half-cylinder:\n1. The force exerted by the internal pressure $P$, which acts to push the two halves apart. This force, $F_P$, acts perpendicularly to the cut surface. The area over which this pressure is projected is a rectangle of width equal to the cylinder's diameter, $2r$, and length $L$.\nTherefore, the total force due to pressure is:\n$$F_P = P \\times (\\text{Projected Area}) = P(2rL)$$\n\n2. The resisting force generated within the material of the cylinder wall, which acts to hold the two halves together. This force, $F_{\\sigma}$, is the product of the circumferential stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ and the area of the material that was cut. The cut exposes two rectangular cross-sections of the wall, each with area $t \\times L$.\nThus, the total area resisting the pressure is $2tL$. The total resisting force is:\n$$F_{\\sigma} = \\sigma_{\\theta} \\times (\\text{Wall Cross-Sectional Area}) = \\sigma_{\\theta}(2tL)$$\n\nFor the half-cylinder to be in static equilibrium, these two opposing forces must be equal in magnitude:\n$$F_P = F_{\\sigma}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the forces, we get:\n$$P(2rL) = \\sigma_{\\theta}(2tL)$$\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by $2L$. The length $L$ cancels, which is consistent with the assumption that end effects are negligible for a long cylinder.\n$$Pr = \\sigma_{\\theta}t$$\nSolving for the circumferential stress, $\\sigma_{\\theta}$, we obtain the desired functional dependence:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta} = \\frac{Pr}{t}$$\nThis relationship shows that the hoop stress is directly proportional to the product of pressure and radius, and inversely proportional to the wall thickness.\n\nNext, we must compute the dimensionless ratio of the circumferential stresses in the Gram-negative ($\\mathrm{GN}$) and Gram-positive ($\\mathrm{GP}$) bacteria, denoted $\\sigma_{\\theta,\\mathrm{GN}} / \\sigma_{\\theta,\\mathrm{GP}}$.
