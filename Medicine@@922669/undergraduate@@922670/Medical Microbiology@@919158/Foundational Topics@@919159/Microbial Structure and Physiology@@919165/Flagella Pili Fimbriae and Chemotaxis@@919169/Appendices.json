Uropathogenic *E. coli* (UPEC) uses type $1$ fimbriae, with FimA as the major shaft subunit and FimH as the terminal adhesin, to bind to mannosylated receptors on bladder epithelial cells. The genes (`pilE`, `fimA`), structures (type IV pili, type $1$ fimbriae), assembly pathway (chaperone-usher), and functions (twitching motility, adhesion) are all described correctly. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly formulated. It asks for the phenotypic consequences of specific gene deletions that target the primary structural components of two distinct appendages. The relationship between the deleted gene and the assayed function is direct, allowing for a unique and logical solution based on first principles.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and devoid of subjectivity or ambiguity.\n4.  **Completeness**: The problem provides all necessary information to deduce the outcome based on the specified constraints. It describes the wild-type state, the specific genetic modification, the function of the gene product, and the functional assay being performed for each mutant.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will now proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe core principle to be applied is that the function of a macroscopic biological structure is contingent upon its proper assembly from its constituent molecular components. Both type IV pili and type $1$ fimbriae are polymeric fibers composed primarily of repeating subunits, known as the major pilin/fimbrial subunits.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the *Neisseria pilE* Mutant**:\n    - Type IV pili are dynamic polymers that mediate twitching motility through cycles of extension, surface attachment, and retraction.\n    - The pilus fiber is a helical polymer composed of thousands of copies of the major pilin subunit, PilE.\n    - The gene `pilE` encodes this major subunit. A deletion of `pilE` (`\\Delta pilE`) results in the inability to produce the primary building block of the pilus fiber.\n    - **First Principle Application**: Without the major subunit, the pilus fiber cannot be assembled. Minor pilins, which are present in much smaller quantities and have specialized roles (e.g., initiation, adhesion), cannot substitute for the major structural protein to form a functional fiber. The machinery for pilus retraction (e.g., the ATPase PilT) is irrelevant if there is no pilus to retract.\n    - **Conclusion**: The absence of the pilus fiber means the physical structure required for twitching motility is absent. Therefore, a `\\Delta pilE` mutant will be completely deficient in twitching motility.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the UPEC *fimA* Mutant**:\n    - Type $1$ fimbriae are surface appendages that mediate adhesion of UPEC to host cells.\n    - The structure consists of a long, rigid rod (or shaft) and a short, flexible tip fibrillum. The rod is a polymer of the major subunit, FimA. The tip contains the adhesin FimH, which binds to mannose-containing glycoproteins on host cells, such as the bladder epithelium.\n    - The gene `fimA` encodes the FimA subunit. A deletion of `fimA` (`\\Delta fimA`) results in the inability to produce the major component of the fimbrial rod.\n    - **First Principle Application**: Without the FimA subunit, the long rod structure cannot be assembled. The chaperone-usher system may assemble a minimal structure at the bacterial surface consisting of the minor subunits (FimG, FimF) and the FimH adhesin, but this structure lacks the lengthy projection provided by the FimA rod. This projection is critical for overcoming electrostatic repulsion between the bacterium and host cell and for presenting the FimH adhesin in a functionally accessible position.\n    - **Conclusion**: The absence of the fimbrial rod will severely impair or completely abolish the ability of the bacterium to adhere to bladder epithelial cells via the type $1$ fimbrial mechanism. This adhesion is specifically known as mannose-sensitive adhesion because it can be inhibited by free mannose. Therefore, a `\\Delta fimA` mutant will have its mannose-sensitive adhesion phenotype abolished.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Deleting pilE abolishes twitching motility in Neisseria; deleting fimA abolishes mannose-sensitive adhesion to bladder epithelial cells in UPEC.**\n- *Neisseria* prediction: Correct. As derived above, deleting the gene for the major pilin subunit (`pilE`) prevents the assembly of the pilus fiber, thus abolishing the motility that depends on it.\n- UPEC prediction: Correct. As derived above, deleting the gene for the major shaft subunit (`fimA`) prevents the formation of the fimbrial rod, which is essential for presenting the FimH adhesin and mediating adhesion. This specific adhesion is mannose-sensitive.\n- **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**B. Deleting pilE retains twitching in Neisseria via compensation by minor pilins and PilT retraction; deleting fimA yields little change in bladder adhesion because P pili compensate in UPEC.**\n- *Neisseria* prediction: Incorrect. Minor pilins cannot functionally replace the major subunit to form a polymer of sufficient length for twitching. The PilT retraction motor cannot function without a pilus to act upon.\n- UPEC prediction: Incorrect. This invokes an assumption not provided in the problem statement—the presence and expression of P pili. The question requires a prediction based on the described system. Furthermore, P pili mediate a different type of adhesion (to globoside receptors), so they would not \"compensate\" for the loss of mannose-sensitive adhesion; they would constitute a different function.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**C. Deleting pilE primarily impairs chemotaxis sensing but preserves twitching in Neisseria; deleting fimA increases bladder adhesion in UPEC by exposing FimH directly on the outer membrane.**\n- *Neisseria* prediction: Incorrect. While pilus-mediated motility can be directed, the primary function of the pilus itself is motility, not sensing. The definitive phenotype of a `pilE` mutant is the loss of the pilus structure and therefore the complete loss of twitching motility. It is not preserved.\n- UPEC prediction: Incorrect. Exposing FimH directly at the outer membrane, without the FimA shaft, would drastically *decrease* adhesion due to steric hindrance and the inability to bridge the gap to the host cell surface.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. Deleting pilE reduces flagellar swimming but not twitching in Neisseria; deleting fimA reduces biofilm formation but not bladder epithelial adhesion in UPEC.**\n- *Neisseria* prediction: Incorrect. Pathogenic *Neisseria* species are typically non-flagellated; they do not perform flagellar swimming. Pili are distinct from flagella. The statement that twitching is *not* reduced is the exact opposite of the expected outcome.\n- UPEC prediction: Incorrect. Initial adhesion is a prerequisite for biofilm formation on host cells. The loss of the primary adhesion mechanism (type $1$ fimbriae) would necessarily reduce or abolish both adhesion and subsequent biofilm formation. Claiming that adhesion is not reduced is fundamentally wrong.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**E. Deleting pilE affects only DNA uptake (natural competence) but not twitching in Neisseria; deleting fimA alters lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and thereby increases adhesion in UPEC.**\n- *Neisseria* prediction: Incorrect. Type IV pili are multifunctional, mediating twitching motility, adhesion, and natural competence (DNA uptake). Deleting `pilE` ablates all these functions. The claim that twitching is not affected is false.\n- UPEC prediction: Incorrect. The `fimA` gene encodes a fimbrial protein subunit and is not involved in the biosynthesis or structure of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). There is no first-principle basis for this pleiotropic effect. The prediction of increased adhesion is also incorrect.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4630845"}, {"introduction": "Building a complex nanomachine like a flagellum requires incredible precision and energy.

At this point, FlgM is secreted from the cell through the flagellar type III-related export pathway. This allows $\\sigma^{28}$-dependent transcription to proceed.\n6.  **Filament Polymerization:** Requires export of flagellin subunits through the assembled HBB. Cytosolic flagellin cannot polymerize.\n7.  **Genetic Modification:** A deletion of the anti-sigma factor gene, $\\Delta flgM$, is created in a wild-type genetic background.\n8.  **Measurements:**\n    - A reporter for $\\sigma^{28}$-dependent transcription is measured at $t=20$ minutes (early) and $t=60$ minutes (late).\n    - Cellular localization of flagellin (cytosolic vs. filament-incorporated) is monitored.\n    - Filament formation (timing and abundance) is observed.\n9.  **Question:** Predict the composite phenotype for the $\\Delta flgM$ mutant based only on the provided definitions.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the validation criteria:\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The description of the flagellar transcriptional hierarchy involving the master operon ($flhDC$, class I), middle genes (class II, including HBB components and $\\sigma^{28}$), and late genes (class III, including $fliC$) controlled by the FlgM/$\\sigma^{28}$ checkpoint is a well-established and fundamental concept in molecular microbiology.

The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear initial state (wild-type regulatory system), a specific perturbation ($\\Delta flgM$), and a set of rules governing the system's behavior. The question asks for a logical deduction of the consequences of this perturbation. A unique and stable phenotype can be predicted from the given information. The problem is well-posed.\n-   **Objective:** The language is formal, precise, and devoid of subjectivity. All terms are standard in the field of microbiology and are explicitly defined within the context of the problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived based on the provided principles.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds by comparing the sequence of events in the wild-type (WT) organism to the predicted events in the engineered $\\Delta flgM$ mutant.\n\n### Wild-Type (WT) Control Pathway\n1.  **Early Stage (e.g., $t <$ HBB completion, approx. $t=20$ min):** The HBB is not yet assembled. FlgM protein is present in the cytoplasm. It binds to and sequesters the $\\sigma^{28}$ factor. As a result, $\\sigma^{28}$ cannot associate with RNA polymerase to initiate transcription of class III genes. Therefore, in a WT cell, transcription of $fliC$ is low at this stage.\n2.  **Checkpoint Stage (HBB completion, e.g., $t > 20$ min):** Once the HBB is fully assembled, it becomes a competent protein export channel. FlgM is recognized as an export substrate and is secreted from the cytoplasm.\n3.  **Late Stage (e.g., $t=60$ min):** The secretion of FlgM drastically lowers its cytoplasmic concentration. This liberates $\\sigma^{28}$, which can now bind RNA polymerase and activate the transcription of class III genes, including $fliC$, $motA$, and $motB$. This burst of transcription leads to the synthesis of flagellin subunits. These newly synthesized subunits are then exported through the completed HBBs and polymerize at the distal tip to form the flagellar filaments. This regulatory coupling ensures that flagellin is only produced when the structure necessary for its export and assembly (the HBB) is complete.\n\n### Predicted $\\Delta flgM$ Mutant Pathway\nThe $\\Delta flgM$ mutant lacks the gene encoding the FlgM protein. Therefore, FlgM is never produced.\n\n1.  **Early Stage (e.g., $t=20$ min):** In the absence of the FlgM anti-sigma factor, the $\\sigma^{28}$ factor is free to associate with RNA polymerase as soon as it (i.e., $\\sigma^{28}$) is synthesized (as a class II gene product). The regulatory link between HBB completion and class III gene expression is broken. Transcription of class III genes like $fliC$ is \"derepressed\" or \"constitutively active\" and is no longer inhibited pending HBB assembly. Consequently, the reporter for $\\sigma^{28}$-dependent transcription will show high activity even at the early time point of $t=20$ minutes, a level that WT cells would only achieve at a later stage.\n2.  **Flagellin Accumulation:** Due to this early transcription, flagellin protein subunits are synthesized prematurely. However, the problem explicitly states that filament polymerization requires export through an *assembled* HBB. At $t=20$ minutes, the HBB is incomplete and cannot export flagellin. Therefore, the prematurely synthesized flagellin subunits cannot be incorporated into filaments and will accumulate in the cytoplasm.\n3.  **Filament Formation:** Once the HBB assembly is eventually completed (sometime after $t=20$ minutes), it becomes a functional export channel. At this moment, the cell has a large pre-existing stockpile of cytoplasmic flagellin. Unlike the WT cell, which must transcribe and translate flagellin *after* HBB completion, the $\\Delta flgM$ mutant can begin exporting its stored flagellin immediately. This will lead to an \"accelerated onset\" of filament formation relative to WT.\n4.  **Filament Length and Number:** Because class III gene transcription begins earlier and continues, the total integrated amount of flagellin produced over the cell's lifetime may be greater than in WT. This larger supply of subunits could allow the filaments to polymerize to \"greater lengths\". The number of filaments per cell, however, is determined by the number of HBBs initiated on the cell surface. The assembly of HBBs is controlled by class I and class II genes, which are upstream of the FlgM/$\\sigma^{28}$ checkpoint. Deleting $flgM$ does not directly alter the regulation of HBB synthesis. Therefore, the number of filaments per cell is expected to be similar to WT, as it is \"constrained by earlier assembly steps.\"\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Constitutive derepression of $\\sigma^{28}$-dependent genes independent of hook-basal body completion, such that the reporter at $t=20$ minutes is elevated to near wild-type late levels; early cytosolic accumulation of flagellin prior to completion; once the hook-basal body completes, filaments form with an accelerated onset relative to wild type and can reach greater lengths due to increased flagellin supply, while the number of filaments per cell remains constrained by earlier assembly steps.**\nThis option accurately describes all the predicted consequences derived from the first principles. It correctly identifies the constitutive transcription, the resulting cytosolic accumulation of flagellin before HBB completion, the accelerated onset of polymerization once HBBs are ready, the potential for longer filaments, and the unchanged number of filaments.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Decreased $\\sigma^{28}$-dependent transcription at all times because FlgM is required to recruit RNA polymerase; both reporter activity and filament formation are reduced throughout.**\nThis statement incorrectly defines the function of FlgM. The problem states FlgM is an *anti-sigma factor* that *prevents* $\\sigma^{28}$ from associating with RNA polymerase. It is an inhibitor, not an activator or recruitment factor. Deleting it would increase, not decrease, transcription.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. No change in $\\sigma^{28}$-dependent transcription, but an increase in filament number because FlgM serves as a structural cap protein necessary for efficient polymerization at the filament tip.**\nThis option is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, deleting the primary inhibitor FlgM will certainly change the timing of $\\sigma^{28}$-dependent transcription. Second, the problem defines FlgM as an anti-sigma factor, not a structural cap protein (which is the role of FliD). Third, an increase in filament *number* is not expected, as this is determined by HBB synthesis, which is regulated by upstream genes.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Constitutive derepression of $\\sigma^{28}$-dependent genes, but abolition of filament formation because export of flagellin requires FlgM to be secreted through the hook-basal body.**\nThe first part (\"Constitutive derepression\") is correct. However, the conclusion (\"abolition of filament formation\") is based on a faulty premise. The fact that FlgM is secreted does not imply its secretion is a mechanistic requirement for the export of other substrates like flagellin. The role of FlgM secretion is purely regulatory—to relieve its own inhibitory activity. In the absence of FlgM, the export channel, once formed, is free to transport its primary structural substrate, flagellin.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. No alteration in early $\\sigma^{28}$-dependent transcription; activation occurs only upon hook-basal body completion via export-coupled mechanisms, and filament formation proceeds with timing and extent comparable to wild type.**\nThis describes the phenotype of the wild type, not the $\\Delta flgM$ mutant. Deleting the gene for a key negative regulator must alter the system's dynamics.

We can proceed with a solution based on the provided principles.\n\nLet the bacterium consist of two rigid parts: the cell body and the flagellum. Let their angular velocities in the laboratory frame be $\\Omega_{\\text{body}}$ and $\\Omega_{\\text{flag}}$, respectively, along the axis of swimming. The quantity $\\omega$ given in the problem is the relative angular velocity between the flagellum and the body, which is the rotation rate of the motor itself: $\\omega = \\Omega_{\\text{flag}} - \\Omega_{\\text{body}}$. The bacterium as a whole translates with a steady-state speed $v$.\n\nAccording to the provided principles, the system is in mechanical equilibrium at steady state, meaning there is no net external force and no net external torque acting on the bacterium. The motor provides an internal torque $\\tau_0$ on the flagellum and, by Newton's third law, a torque $-\\tau_0$ on the cell body.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the rotational motion using a torque balance.\nFor a freely swimming bacterium, the total external torque is zero. The only external torques are the hydrodynamic drag torques on the body and the flagellum.\nLet the hydrodynamic drag torque on the body be $T_{\\text{d,body}}$ and on the flagellum be $T_{\\text{d,flag}}$. The net external torque is zero:\n$$ T_{\\text{d,body}} + T_{\\text{d,flag}} = 0 $$\nNow, consider the torque balance on each component individually.\nFor the cell body, the sum of the torque from the motor and the hydrodynamic drag torque is zero:\n$$ -\\tau_0 + T_{\\text{d,body}} = 0 \\implies T_{\\text{d,body}} = \\tau_0 $$\nFor the flagellum, the sum of the motor torque and the hydrodynamic drag torque is zero:\n$$ \\tau_0 + T_{\\text{d,flag}} = 0 \\implies T_{\\text{d,flag}} = -\\tau_0 $$\nThis is consistent with the zero net external torque condition.\n\nFrom the first principle, hydrodynamic torques are linear in angular velocity:\n$T_{\\text{d,body}} = -\\gamma_{R,\\text{body}} \\Omega_{\\text{body}}$\n$T_{\\text{d,flag}} = -\\gamma_{R,\\text{flag}} \\Omega_{\\text{flag}}$\nwhere $\\gamma_{R,\\text{body}}$ and $\\gamma_{R,\\text{flag}}$ are the rotational resistance coefficients.

Thus, we can write $\\gamma_{R,\\text{body}} = k_{R,\\text{body}} \\eta$ and $\\gamma_{R,\\text{flag}} = k_{R,\\text{flag}} \\eta$, where the $k$ factors depend only on the fixed geometry.

This means the total propulsive thrust force, $F_{\\text{thrust}}$, must be equal and opposite to the total hydrodynamic drag force, $F_{\\text{drag}}$.\n$$ F_{\\text{thrust}} + F_{\\text{drag}} = 0 $$\nThe total drag force on the bacterium moving at speed $v$ is $F_{\\text{drag}} = -\\gamma_T v$, where $\\gamma_T$ is the total translational resistance coefficient. We have $\\gamma_T = k_T \\eta$.\nThe thrust is generated by the rotation of the helical flagellum and the counter-rotation of the body. At low Reynolds number, forces and torques are linearly related to velocities. This means the thrust force is a linear combination of the angular velocities:\n$$ F_{\\text{thrust}} = c_{\\text{flag}} \\Omega_{\\text{flag}} + c_{\\text{body}} \\Omega_{\\text{body}} $$\nThe coefficients $c_{\\text{flag}}$ and $c_{\\text{body}}$ are coupling coefficients that relate angular velocity to translational force. As part of the generalized resistance matrix describing the hydrodynamics, these coefficients are also proportional to viscosity $\\eta$. So, $c_{\\text{flag}} = j_{\\text{flag}} \\eta$ and $c_{\\text{body}} = j_{\\text{body}} \\eta$, where $j$ factors depend on geometry.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Omega_{\\text{flag}}$ and $\\Omega_{\\text{body}}$:\n$$ F_{\\text{thrust}} = (j_{\\text{flag}} \\eta) \\left( \\frac{\\tau_0}{\\gamma_{R,\\text{flag}}} \\right) + (j_{\\text{body}} \\eta) \\left( -\\frac{\\tau_0}{\\gamma_{R,\\text{body}}} \\right) $$\nSubstitute $\\gamma_R = k_R \\eta$:\n$$ F_{\\text{thrust}} = (j_{\\text{flag}} \\eta) \\left( \\frac{\\tau_0}{k_{R,\\text{flag}} \\eta} \\right) - (j_{\\text{body}} \\eta) \\left( \\frac{\\tau_0}{k_{R,\\text{body}} \\eta} \\right) $$\nThe viscosity $\\eta$ cancels out in the expression for thrust:\n$$ F_{\\text{thrust}} = \\tau_0 \\left( \\frac{j_{\\text{flag}}}{k_{R,\\text{flag}}} - \\frac{j_{\\text{body}}}{k_{R,\\text{body}}} \\right) $$\nSince $\\tau_0$ and all $j$ and $k$ factors are constant, the thrust force $F_{\\text{thrust}}$ is constant and independent of viscosity.\n\nThe force balance is $F_{\\text{thrust}} + F_{\\text{drag}} = 0$, so $F_{\\text{thrust}} = -F_{\\text{drag}} = \\gamma_T v$.\n$$ \\tau_0 \\left( \\frac{j_{\\text{flag}}}{k_{R,\\text{flag}}} - \\frac{j_{\\text{body}}}{k_{R,\\text{body}}} \\right) = (k_T \\eta) v $$\nThe left side is constant. Let's call it $C$. Then $C = k_T \\eta v$.\nSolving for the swimming speed $v$:\n$$ v = \\frac{C}{k_T \\eta} $$\nThis shows that the swimming speed $v$ is inversely proportional to the viscosity $\\eta$:\n$$ v \\propto \\frac{1}{\\eta} $$\nWhen the viscosity changes from $\\eta_{\\text{old}} = \\eta$ to $\\eta_{\\text{new}} = 2\\eta$, the ratio of the new swimming speed to the old one is:\n$$ \\frac{v_{\\text{new}}}{v_{\\text{old}}} = \\frac{1/\\eta_{\\text{new}}}{1/\\eta_{\\text{old}}} = \\frac{\\eta_{\\text{old}}}{\\eta_{\\text{new}}} = \\frac{\\eta}{2\\eta} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\nBoth the angular rotation rate and the swimming speed are reduced by a factor of $2$. The final result is the row matrix $(\\frac{\\omega_{\\text{new}}}{\\omega_{\\text{old}}}, \\frac{v_{\\text{new}}}{v_{\\text{old}}})$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4630863"}]}
