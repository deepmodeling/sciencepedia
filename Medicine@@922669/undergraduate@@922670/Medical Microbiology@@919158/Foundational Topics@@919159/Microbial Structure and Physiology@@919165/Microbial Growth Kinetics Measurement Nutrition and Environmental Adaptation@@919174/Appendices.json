It is a standard, didactic problem in quantitative microbiology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Generation Time $g$**\n\nThe exponential growth of the bacterial population is described by the equation:\n$$\nN(t) = N_{0}\\exp(\\mu t)\n$$\nwhere $N(t)$ is the population size at time $t$, $N_{0}$ is the initial population size at $t=0$, and $\\mu$ is the specific growth rate.\n\nThe generation time, $g$, is defined as the time it takes for the population to double. Therefore, at time $t=g$, the population size is $N(g) = 2N_{0}$. We substitute this condition into the growth equation:\n$$\n2N_{0} = N_{0}\\exp(\\mu g)\n$$\nSince $N_{0}$ must be positive for a population to exist, we can divide both sides by $N_{0}$:\n$$\n2 = \\exp(\\mu g)\n$$\nTo solve for $g$, we take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\ln(2) = \\ln(\\exp(\\mu g))\n$$\nUsing the property that $\\ln(\\exp(x)) = x$, we get:\n$$\n\\ln(2) = \\mu g\n$$\nFinally, we isolate $g$ to find its expression in terms of $\\mu$:\n$$\ng = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\mu}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of Effective Generation Time $g_{\\mathrm{eff}}$**\n\nIn the presence of the aminoglycoside, the dynamics of the viable cell population, $N_{v}(t)$, are governed by the linear birth-death equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_{v}}{dt} = (\\mu - k_{d})N_{v}\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can define an effective specific growth rate, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\mu - k_{d}$. The equation then becomes formally identical to the one in Part 1:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_{v}}{dt} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}N_{v}\n$$\nThe solution to this differential equation is:\n$$\nN_{v}(t) = N_{v}(0)\\exp(\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}} t) = N_{v}(0)\\exp((\\mu - k_{d})t)\n$$\nwhere $N_{v}(0)$ is the initial number of viable cells.\n\nThe effective generation time, $g_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is the time required for the viable cell population to double. At $t = g_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, we have $N_{v}(g_{\\mathrm{eff}}) = 2N_{v}(0)$. Substituting this into the solution:\n$$\n2N_{v}(0) = N_{v}(0)\\exp((\\mu - k_{d})g_{\\mathrm{eff}})\n$$\nDividing by $N_{v}(0)$ (which is non-zero):\n$$\n2 = \\exp((\\mu - k_{d})g_{\\mathrm{eff}})\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln(2) = (\\mu - k_{d})g_{\\mathrm{eff}}\n$$\nSolving for $g_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ yields the analytic expression:\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\mu - k_{d}}\n$$\nFor the viable cell population to double, its size must increase over time. This requires the effective growth rate to be positive. Therefore, the condition under which doubling is possible is:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}  0 \\implies \\mu - k_{d}  0 \\implies \\mu  k_{d}\n$$\nIf $\\mu \\le k_{d}$, the viable population will either remain constant or decline, and no doubling will occur. A positive, finite generation time $g_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is only defined if the birth rate exceeds the death rate.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of $g_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ in minutes**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Specific growth rate: $\\mu = 0.95\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n- Per-capita death rate: $k_{d} = 0.45\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we check the condition for doubling: $\\mu  k_{d}$. Here, $0.95\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}  0.45\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, so the condition is satisfied and the viable population will grow.\n\nNext, we calculate the effective growth rate, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\mu - k_{d} = 0.95\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} - 0.45\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, we use the expression for $g_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ derived in Part 2:\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.50\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$:\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx \\frac{0.693147}{0.50}\\,\\mathrm{h} = 1.386294\\,\\mathrm{h}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in minutes. We convert hours to minutes by multiplying by $60$:\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{eff}} (\\text{in minutes}) = 1.386294\\,\\mathrm{h} \\times 60\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{min}}{\\mathrm{h}} \\approx 83.17764\\,\\mathrm{min}\n$$\nFinally, we round the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 83.18\\,\\mathrm{min}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{83.18}$$", "id": "4652875"}, {"introduction": "While growth rate describes how fast a population increases, biomass yield explains how efficiently it converts nutrients into new cells. This efficiency is not a random number; it is fundamentally dictated by the energy generated from metabolism.

Thus, complete oxidation of one glucose via two turns of the TCA cycle yields $6$ NADH, $2$ $FADH_2$, and $2$ ATP-equivalents via GTP.\n- Under anaerobic homolactic fermentation, the $2$ NADH produced by glycolysis are reoxidized when $2$ pyruvate are reduced to $2$ lactate, with no electron transport chain (ETC) activity and no oxidative phosphorylation beyond the substrate-level steps in glycolysis.\n- Define the phosphorylation-to-oxygen (P/O) equivalents for oxidative phosphorylation as the effective ATP yield per reoxidized reduced cofactor: let $p_{\\mathrm{NADH}}$ be the ATP yield per NADH oxidized and $p_{\\mathrm{FADH_2}}$ be the ATP yield per $FADH_2$ oxidized. Take $p_{\\mathrm{NADH}}=2.5$ and $p_{\\mathrm{FADH_2}}=1.5$.\n- Let the biomass yield per ATP be characterized by a constant coefficient $Y_{X/ATP}$ (grams dry weight per mole ATP) equal to $12$, and neglect non-growth-associated maintenance ATP demand under both conditions.\n- The biomass yield on substrate $Y_{X/S}$ is defined as grams dry weight of biomass produced per mole of glucose consumed, and is assumed proportional to the total ATP generated per mole of glucose via the coefficient $Y_{X/ATP}$.\n\nUsing only these bases, derive the ATP yield per mole of glucose under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, then infer how these ATP yields map to the biomass yields on substrate under the stated assumptions.

The problem states that the biomass yield on substrate, $Y_{X/S}$ (in units of grams dry weight per mole of glucose), is directly proportional to the total ATP generated per mole of glucose, which we denote as $Y_{ATP/S}$. The constant of proportionality is the biomass yield per ATP, $Y_{X/ATP}$, which is given as $12 \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{mol ATP}}$.

This involves summing the ATP produced by substrate-level phosphorylation (SLP) and by oxidative phosphorylation.\n\n-   **Glycolysis (Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway):** The conversion of $1$ mole of glucose to $2$ moles of pyruvate yields a net of:\n    -   $2$ moles of ATP via SLP.\n    -   $2$ moles of NADH.\n\n-   **Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Reaction:** The conversion of $2$ moles of pyruvate to $2$ moles of acetyl-CoA yields:\n    -   $2$ moles of NADH.\n\n-   **Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) Cycle:** The complete oxidation of $2$ moles of acetyl-CoA (requiring two turns of the cycle) yields:\n    -   $2$ moles of GTP, which are energetically equivalent to $2$ moles of ATP via SLP.\n    -   $6$ moles of NADH.\n    -   $2$ moles of $FADH_2$.\n\n-   **Total Yield of Reduced Cofactors and SLP ATP:**\n    -   Total ATP from SLP = ($2$ from glycolysis) + ($2$ from TCA cycle as GTP) = $4$ moles of ATP.\n    -   Total NADH = ($2$ from glycolysis) + ($2$ from pyruvate dehydrogenase) + ($6$ from TCA cycle) = $10$ moles of NADH.\n    -   Total $FADH_2$ = $2$ moles from the TCA cycle.\n\n-   **ATP from Oxidative Phosphorylation:** We use the given phosphorylation-to-oxygen (P/O) equivalents, $p_{\\mathrm{NADH}} = 2.5$ and $p_{\\mathrm{FADH_2}} = 1.5$.\n    -   ATP from NADH oxidation = $10 \\text{ mol NADH} \\times 2.5 \\frac{\\text{mol ATP}}{\\text{mol NADH}} = 25$ moles of ATP.\n    -   ATP from $FADH_2$ oxidation = $2 \\text{ mol } FADH_2 \\times 1.5 \\frac{\\text{mol ATP}}{\\text{mol } FADH_2} = 3$ moles of ATP.\n    -   Total ATP from oxidative phosphorylation = $25 + 3 = 28$ moles of ATP.\n\n-   **Total Aerobic ATP Yield:** The total yield, $(Y_{ATP/S})_{\\mathrm{aerobic}}$, is the sum of ATP from SLP and oxidative phosphorylation:\n    $$\n    (Y_{ATP/S})_{\\mathrm{aerobic}} = 4 \\text{ ATP}_{\\text{SLP}} + 28 \\text{ ATP}_{\\text{OxPhos}} = 32 \\text{ moles of ATP per mole of glucose}.\n    $$\n\n**2. ATP Yield from Anaerobic Homolactic Fermentation**\n\nUnder anaerobic conditions, the cell cannot use oxidative phosphorylation. The only source of ATP is glycolysis.\n\n-   **Glycolysis:** As before, the conversion of $1$ mole of glucose to $2$ moles of pyruvate yields a net of $2$ moles of ATP via SLP and $2$ moles of NADH.\n-   **Fermentation:** To maintain redox balance in the absence of an external electron acceptor, the $2$ moles of NADH produced in glycolysis are reoxidized by reducing the $2$ moles of pyruvate to $2$ moles of lactate.
