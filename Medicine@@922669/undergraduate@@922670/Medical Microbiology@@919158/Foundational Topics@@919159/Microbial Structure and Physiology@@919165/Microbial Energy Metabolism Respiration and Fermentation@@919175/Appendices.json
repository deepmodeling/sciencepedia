To derive this ratio, we will use the provided stoichiometric values in a step-by-step calculation based on the principles of chemiosmosis.\n\nFirst, we establish the number of electrons ($e^-$) that are transferred to a single molecule of $O_2$, which serves as the terminal electron acceptor. The problem states that one molecule of $O_2$ accepts $4e^-$. This gives the first conversion factor:\n$$ R_1 = \\frac{4 \\, e^-}{1 \\, O_2} $$\n\nSecond, we determine the number of protons ($\\mathrm{H}^+$) pumped across the membrane by the respiratory chain.

This provides a second conversion factor, which can be simplified:\n$$ R_2 = \\frac{10 \\, \\mathrm{H}^+}{2 \\, e^-} = \\frac{5 \\, \\mathrm{H}^+}{1 \\, e^-} $$\nThis ratio signifies that for each electron transferred, $5$ protons are pumped.\n\nUsing these two relationships, we can calculate the total number of protons pumped as a result of the reduction of a single molecule of $O_2$. This is achieved by multiplying the number of electrons per $O_2$ molecule by the number of protons pumped per electron:\n$$ \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{H}^+}^{\\text{pumped}}}{N_{O_2}} = R_1 \\times R_2 = \\left( \\frac{4 \\, e^-}{1 \\, O_2} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{5 \\, \\mathrm{H}^+}{1 \\, e^-} \\right) = \\frac{20 \\, \\mathrm{H}^+}{1 \\, O_2} $$\nTherefore, the complete reduction of one molecule of $O_2$ drives the pumping of $20$ protons across the membrane.\n\nThird, we relate the number of pumped protons to the number of $\\text{ATP}$ molecules synthesized. The problem states that the $\\text{ATP}$ synthase requires $3.3$ protons to be translocated back across the membrane for each molecule of $\\text{ATP}$ synthesized.
