The non-trivial (or positive) equilibrium, obtained by setting the term in the parenthesis to zero:\n    $$\n    (r_{\\text{eff}} - \\mu) - \\frac{r}{K}B^\\ast_2 = 0 \\implies B^\\ast_2 = K \\frac{r_{\\text{eff}} - \\mu}{r}\n    $$\nFor the biomass $B^\\ast$ to be physically meaningful, it must be non-negative ($B^\\ast \\ge 0$). The trivial equilibrium $B^\\ast_1 = 0$ always satisfies this. The non-trivial equilibrium $B^\\ast_2$ is non-negative if and only if:\n$$\nK \\frac{r_{\\text{eff}} - \\mu}{r} \\ge 0\n$$\nSince $K > 0$ and $r > 0$ are given, this simplifies to the condition:\n$$\nr_{\\text{eff}} - \\mu \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad r_{\\text{eff}} \\ge \\mu\n$$\nThis condition represents the biological threshold for invasion: the effective proliferation rate must be at least as large as the immune clearance rate for the fungal population to establish itself.

Substituting this into the inequality:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\alpha \\, e}{\\beta} \\left( K \\frac{r_{\\text{eff}} - \\mu}{r} \\right) \\ge D_{\\text{thresh}}\n    $$\nThis is the explicit inequality that must be satisfied for disease to occur. It requires both the establishment of the fungal population ($r_{\\text{eff}} > \\mu$) and sufficient damage accumulation.
