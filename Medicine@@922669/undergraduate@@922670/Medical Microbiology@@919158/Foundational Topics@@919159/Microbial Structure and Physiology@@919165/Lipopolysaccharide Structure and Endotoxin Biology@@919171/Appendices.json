All necessary data are provided, and the premises are consistent with established principles in endotoxin testing.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the total mass of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in an aqueous batch, based on its measured endotoxin activity, volume, and a supplied calibration factor. The solution proceeds in two logical steps as requested.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the measured activity concentration and the mass concentration. The problem states that there is a proportionality between Endotoxin Units (EU) and the mass of the specific LPS reference standard. This proportionality is given by the calibration factor, which we can denote as $k$.\n$$ k = \\frac{0.1 \\, \\text{ng}}{1 \\, \\text{EU}} = 0.1 \\, \\text{ng} \\cdot \\text{EU}^{-1} $$\nLet the measured endotoxin activity concentration be $C_{EU}$. The given value is:\n$$ C_{EU} = 5 \\, \\text{EU} \\cdot \\text{mL}^{-1} $$\nTo convert this activity concentration into a mass concentration, denoted as $C_{mass}$, we multiply $C_{EU}$ by the calibration factor $k$. This operation is an application of dimensional analysis, which cancels the Endotoxin Units (EU) and introduces units of mass (ng), yielding the mass of LPS per unit volume.\n$$ C_{mass} = C_{EU} \\times k $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ C_{mass} = \\left( 5 \\, \\frac{\\text{EU}}{\\text{mL}} \\right) \\times \\left( 0.1 \\, \\frac{\\text{ng}}{\\text{EU}} \\right) $$\n$$ C_{mass} = (5 \\times 0.1) \\, \\frac{\\text{ng}}{\\text{mL}} $$\n$$ C_{mass} = 0.5 \\, \\text{ng} \\cdot \\text{mL}^{-1} $$\nThis is the mass concentration of the LPS in the solution.\n\nSecond, we determine the total endotoxin mass in the batch. The problem specifies a well-mixed solution, which implies that the concentration $C_{mass}$ is uniform throughout the entire volume. The principle of mass conservation dictates that the total mass of a substance, $M_{total}$, in a given volume is the product of its concentration and the total volume. Let the total volume of the batch be $V$.\n$$ V = 100 \\, \\text{mL} $$\nThe total mass is calculated as:\n$$ M_{total} = C_{mass} \\times V $$\nSubstituting the values for $C_{mass}$ and $V$:\n$$ M_{total} = \\left( 0.5 \\, \\frac{\\text{ng}}{\\text{mL}} \\right) \\times (100 \\, \\text{mL}) $$\nThe unit of volume (mL) cancels out, leaving the final result in units of mass (ng).\n$$ M_{total} = 50 \\, \\text{ng} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $1$ significant figure. The input values $5 \\, \\text{EU} \\cdot \\text{mL}^{-1}$ and $0.1 \\, \\text{ng} \\cdot \\text{EU}^{-1}$ each have one significant figure.

A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation\nThe problem requires deriving the survival fraction, $\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}$, from first principles for a process characterized by a constant hazard rate, $\\lambda$. For a large, homogeneous population, the survival fraction is equivalent to the survival probability, $S(t)$, of a single individual cell.\n\nA memoryless process with a constant hazard rate $\\lambda$ implies that the instantaneous probability of a lethal event (death) in an infinitesimal time interval $dt$, given survival up to time $t$, is $\\lambda dt$.\nLet $S(t)$ be the probability of a cell surviving past time $t$. The probability of surviving up to time $t+dt$ is the product of the probability of surviving up to time $t$ and the probability of surviving the subsequent interval $[t, t+dt)$.\n$$S(t+dt) = S(t) \\times P(\\text{survival in } [t, t+dt) | \\text{survival up to } t)$$\nThe probability of survival in the infinitesimal interval is $(1 - \\lambda dt)$. Thus,\n$$S(t+dt) = S(t)(1 - \\lambda dt)$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$S(t+dt) - S(t) = - \\lambda S(t) dt$$\nDividing by $dt$ and taking the limit as $dt \\to 0$ yields a first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\\frac{dS(t)}{dt} = -\\lambda S(t)$$\nThis equation is separable:\n$$\\frac{dS}{S} = -\\lambda dt$$\nWe integrate both sides. The initial condition is that at $t=0$, the cell is viable, so its survival probability is $S(0)=1$. The integration is performed from the initial state $(t=0, S=1)$ to a general state $(t, S(t))$:\n$$\\int_{1}^{S(t)} \\frac{1}{S'} dS' = \\int_{0}^{t} -\\lambda d\\tau$$\nEvaluating the integrals gives:\n$$[\\ln(S')]_{1}^{S(t)} = [-\\lambda \\tau]_{0}^{t}$$\n$$\\ln(S(t)) - \\ln(1) = -\\lambda (t - 0)$$\nSince $\\ln(1) = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\\ln(S(t)) = -\\lambda t$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the survival function:\n$$S(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\nThe survival fraction of the population, $\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}$, is equal to this single-cell survival probability, $S(t)$.\n\nWe now apply this general result to the specific cases given in the problem.\n\n1.  **Survival fraction for the rough control strain**\n    For the rough strain, the hazard rate is given as $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{rough}} = k$. Substituting this into the general survival function yields:\n    $$\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{rough}}(t)}{N_{0}} = \\exp(-kt)$$\n\n2.  **Survival fraction for the O-antigen shielded smooth strain**\n    For the smooth strain, the effective hazard rate is given as $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{smooth}} = k/f$. Substituting this into the general survival function yields:\n    $$\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{smooth}}(t)}{N_{0}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k}{f}t\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{kt}{f}\\right)$$\n\n3.  **Ratio of survival fractions**\n    The required ratio is $\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{smooth}}(t)/N_{0}}{N_{\\mathrm{rough}}(t)/N_{0}}$. We substitute the expressions derived above:\n    $$\\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{kt}{f}\\right)}{\\exp(-kt)}$$\n    Using the property of exponents $\\frac{\\exp(a)}{\\exp(b)} = \\exp(a-b)$, the expression becomes:\n    $$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{kt}{f} - (-kt)\\right) = \\exp\\left(kt - \\frac{kt}{f}\\right)$$\n    Factoring out the common term $kt$ from the exponent, we obtain the final closed-form expression:\n    $$\\exp\\left(kt\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{f}\\right)\\right)$$\nThis result is consistent with the biology: since $f \\geq 1$, the term $1 - \\frac{1}{f}$ is non-negative, which means the ratio is always greater than or equal to $1$. This indicates that the smooth strain has a higher (or equal) survival fraction compared to the rough strain at any time $t > 0$, which is the expected effect of O-antigen shielding.\n\nThe three requested expressions have been derived from first principles as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(-kt) & \\exp\\left(-\\frac{kt}{f}\\right) & \\exp\\left(kt\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{f}\\right)\\right) \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4646741"}]}
