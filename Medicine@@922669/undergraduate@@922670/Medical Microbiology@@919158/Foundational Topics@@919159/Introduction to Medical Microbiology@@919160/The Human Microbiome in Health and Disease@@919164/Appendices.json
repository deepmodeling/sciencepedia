It provides all necessary data and definitions to compute the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity, a standard metric in community ecology, and to analyze the contributions of different taxa. The problem is formalizable and directly relevant to the topic of medical microbiology. The data presented are consistent and plausible within the context of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of human gut microbiome samples. Therefore, a reasoned solution can be constructed.\n\nThe Bray–Curtis dissimilarity is a measure used in ecology to quantify the compositional dissimilarity between two different samples. Let there be two communities, sample $\\mathrm{A}$ and sample $\\mathrm{B}$, with species counts measured across $n$ taxa. Let the count of the $i$-th taxon in sample $\\mathrm{A}$ be $C_{A,i}$ and in sample $\\mathrm{B}$ be $C_{B,i}$. The Bray–Curtis dissimilarity, $BC_{AB}$, is defined as the sum of the absolute differences in counts for each taxon, normalized by the sum of all counts across both samples. This corresponds to the description \"normalized absolute differences\" provided in the problem. The formula is:\n$$ BC_{AB} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} |C_{A,i} - C_{B,i}|}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (C_{A,i} + C_{B,i})} $$\nThe problem provides count vectors for $n=12$ genera for two samples, $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$.\nThe count vector for sample $\\mathrm{A}$ is:\n$$ C_A = (6000, 3500, 2000, 1500, 100, 300, 800, 500, 100, 1200, 50, 50) $$\nThe count vector for sample $\\mathrm{B}$ is:\n$$ C_B = (2000, 3000, 1800, 1600, 5000, 200, 900, 600, 400, 1000, 70, 30) $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator of the Bray–Curtis formula, which is the sum of the absolute differences for each of the $12$ genera:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{12} |C_{A,i} - C_{B,i}| = |6000 - 2000| + |3500 - 3000| + |2000 - 1800| + |1500 - 1600| + |100 - 5000| + |300 - 200| + |800 - 900| + |500 - 600| + |100 - 400| + |1200 - 1000| + |50 - 70| + |50 - 30|$\n$$ = 4000 + 500 + 200 + 100 + 4900 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 300 + 200 + 20 + 20 $$\n$$ = 10540 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator, which is the sum of all counts in both samples. This can be calculated as the total sum of counts in sample $\\mathrm{A}$ plus the total sum of counts in sample $\\mathrm{B}$.\nTotal counts for sample $\\mathrm{A}$, $S_A = \\sum_{i=1}^{12} C_{A,i}$:\n$$ S_A = 6000 + 3500 + 2000 + 1500 + 100 + 300 + 800 + 500 + 100 + 1200 + 50 + 50 = 16100 $$\nTotal counts for sample $\\mathrm{B}$, $S_B = \\sum_{i=1}^{12} C_{B,i}$:\n$$ S_B = 2000 + 3000 + 1800 + 1600 + 5000 + 200 + 900 + 600 + 400 + 1000 + 70 + 30 = 16600 $$\nThe denominator is the sum of these totals:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{12} (C_{A,i} + C_{B,i}) = S_A + S_B = 16100 + 16600 = 32700 $$\n\nNow, we can compute the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity:\n$$ BC_{AB} = \\frac{10540}{32700} \\approx 0.322324159... $$\nRounding this value to four significant figures as requested gives $0.3223$.\n\nThe contribution of different taxa to the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity depends on their abundance and the magnitude of the difference in abundance between the two samples. The structure of the metric, $BC_{AB} = (\\sum |C_{A,i} - C_{B,i}|) / (\\sum (C_{A,i} + C_{B,i}))$, reveals this relationship.\nTaxa with high abundance and a large difference in counts between samples contribute most significantly to the dissimilarity. In this specific case, the genera *Bacteroides* and *Prevotella* dominate the dissimilarity calculation.\nFor *Bacteroides*, the absolute difference is $|6000 - 2000| = 4000$.\nFor *Prevotella*, the absolute difference is $|100 - 5000| = 4900$.\nThe sum of their contributions to the numerator is $4000 + 4900 = 8900$. This single pair of genera accounts for $8900 / 10540 \\approx 84.4\\%$ of the total sum of differences, thereby driving the high dissimilarity value. This illustrates that the Bray-Curtis metric is highly sensitive to shifts in the most abundant taxa.\n\nConversely, taxa with very low abundance, even if their relative difference is large, contribute minimally to the overall dissimilarity. For example:\nFor *Veillonella*, the counts are $50$ and $70$. The absolute difference is only $20$.\nFor *Lactobacillus*, the counts are $50$ and $30$. The absolute difference is also $20$.\nThe combined contribution of these two low-abundance genera to the numerator is merely $40$, which is less than $0.4\\%$ of the total sum of differences. Their contribution to the denominator ($120$ for *Veillonella* and $80$ for *Lactobacillus*) is similarly small. Therefore, the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity is relatively insensitive to changes in rare taxa.\n\nTaxa with high abundance but small differences have a moderating effect. For instance, *Faecalibacterium* has high counts in both samples ($3500$ and $3000$). Its contribution to the numerator is moderate ($|3500 - 3000| = 500$), but its contribution to the denominator is large ($3500 + 3000 = 6500$). The large value in the denominator, contributed by such stable, abundant taxa, acts to decrease the overall dissimilarity score, effectively highlighting that parts of the community structure are conserved.\n\nIn summary, the substantial dissimilarity value of approximately $0.3223$ is almost entirely attributable to the dramatic, opposing shifts in the abundances of the two dominant genera, *Bacteroides* and *Prevotella*. Changes in moderately abundant taxa provide a smaller contribution, while fluctuations in the rarest taxa are numerically insignificant to the final dissimilarity value.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.3223}\n$$", "id": "4680809"}, {"introduction": "While diversity metrics describe the state of a community, mathematical models help us understand the dynamic interactions that shape it.

The derivation of the solution will now proceed.\n\nThe derivation is structured in three parts: first, we calculate the pathogen's invasion threshold before antibiotic application; second, we calculate the threshold after antibiotic application; finally, we compute the difference between these two thresholds.\n\n**Part 1: Pathogen Invasion Threshold Before Suppression**\n\nThe per-capita growth rate of the pathogen is given by $\\frac{1}{P}\\frac{dP}{dt} = r_{P} - m_{P} - a_{PP} P - a_{PC} C$.\nThe invasion criterion states that the pathogen can invade if its per-capita growth rate is positive when it is rare ($P \\to 0$) and the resident commensal is at its stable equilibrium.\n\nFirst, we find the single-species equilibrium of the commensal, denoted $C^*$. This is found by setting $\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0$ in the absence of the pathogen ($P=0$):\n$$ C(r_{C} - m_{C} - a_{CC} C) = 0 $$\nThis equation has two solutions: the trivial equilibrium $C=0$ and the non-trivial carrying capacity:\n$$ C^* = \\frac{r_{C} - m_{C}}{a_{CC}} $$\nFor a persistent commensal population, we assume $r_{C} > m_{C}$, making $C^*$ positive.\n\nNext, we evaluate the pathogen's initial per-capita growth rate. When the pathogen is rare ($P \\to 0$), its per-capita growth rate in the environment set by the commensal at its equilibrium $C^*$ is:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{1}{P}\\frac{dP}{dt} \\right|_{P \\to 0, C = C^*} = r_{P} - m_{P} - a_{PC} C^* $$\nThe pathogen invades if this rate is positive:\n$$ r_{P} - m_{P} - a_{PC} C^* > 0 $$\nThe invasion threshold, $r_{P, \\text{before}}^{\\mathrm{th}}$, is the minimum value of $r_{P}$ for which this condition holds, which occurs when the growth rate is exactly zero.\n$$ r_{P, \\text{before}}^{\\mathrm{th}} - m_{P} - a_{PC} C^* = 0 $$\nSolving for the threshold and substituting the expression for $C^*$:\n$$ r_{P, \\text{before}}^{\\mathrm{th}} = m_{P} + a_{PC} C^* = m_{P} + a_{PC} \\left(\\frac{r_{C} - m_{C}}{a_{CC}}\\right) $$\n\n**Part 2: Pathogen Invasion Threshold After Suppression**\n\nAfter the application of a broad-spectrum antibiotic, the commensal's intrinsic growth rate is reduced to $s r_{C}$. The commensal's dynamic equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = C\\left(s r_{C} - m_{C} - a_{CC} C - a_{CP} P\\right) $$\nAll other parameters, including those for the pathogen, remain unchanged.\n\nWe find the new single-species equilibrium for the commensal, denoted $C^{**}$, by setting $\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0$ and $P=0$:\n$$ C(s r_{C} - m_{C} - a_{CC} C) = 0 $$\nThe new non-trivial equilibrium is:\n$$ C^{**} = \\frac{s r_{C} - m_{C}}{a_{CC}} $$\nWe assume $s r_{C} > m_{C}$ so that the commensal population persists, albeit at a lower density since $0 < s < 1$.\n\nThe pathogen's invasion criterion is evaluated at this new commensal equilibrium, $C^{**}$. The pathogen's per-capita growth rate is:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{1}{P}\\frac{dP}{dt} \\right|_{P \\to 0, C = C^{**}} = r_{P} - m_{P} - a_{PC} C^{**} > 0 $$\nThe new invasion threshold, $r_{P, \\text{after}}^{\\mathrm{th}}$, is found by setting this rate to zero:\n$$ r_{P, \\text{after}}^{\\mathrm{th}} - m_{P} - a_{PC} C^{**} = 0 $$\nSolving for the threshold and substituting the expression for $C^{**}$:\n$$ r_{P, \\text{after}}^{\\mathrm{th}} = m_{P} + a_{PC} C^{**} = m_{P} + a_{PC} \\left(\\frac{s r_{C} - m_{C}}{a_{CC}}\\right) $$\n\n**Part 3: Change in the Invasion Threshold**\n\nThe problem asks for the change in the pathogen's invasion threshold, $\\Delta r_{P}^{\\mathrm{th}}$, which is the difference between the threshold before suppression and after suppression.\n$$ \\Delta r_{P}^{\\mathrm{th}} = r_{P, \\text{before}}^{\\mathrm{th}} - r_{P, \\text{after}}^{\\mathrm{th}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$ \\Delta r_{P}^{\\mathrm{th}} = \\left[ m_{P} + a_{PC} \\left(\\frac{r_{C} - m_{C}}{a_{CC}}\\right) \\right] - \\left[ m_{P} + a_{PC} \\left(\\frac{s r_{C} - m_{C}}{a_{CC}}\\right) \\right] $$\nThe term $m_{P}$ cancels out. We can factor out the common term $\\frac{a_{PC}}{a_{CC}}$:\n$$ \\Delta r_{P}^{\\mathrm{th}} = \\frac{a_{PC}}{a_{CC}} \\left[ (r_{C} - m_{C}) - (s r_{C} - m_{C}) \\right] $$\nSimplifying the expression inside the brackets:\n$$ \\Delta r_{P}^{\\mathrm{th}} = \\frac{a_{PC}}{a_{CC}} \\left[ r_{C} - m_{C} - s r_{C} + m_{C} \\right] $$\nThe term $m_{C}$ also cancels out, yielding:\n$$ \\Delta r_{P}^{\\mathrm{th}} = \\frac{a_{PC}}{a_{CC}} \\left[ r_{C} - s r_{C} \\right] $$\nFinally, factoring out $r_{C}$ gives the simplified closed-form expression:\n$$ \\Delta r_{P}^{\\mathrm{th}} = \\frac{a_{PC} r_{C} (1 - s)}{a_{CC}} $$\nThis positive change signifies a reduction in the pathogen's invasion threshold, making invasion easier. The parameters responsible for this shift are the interspecific competition coefficient from commensal to pathogen ($a_{PC}$), the commensal's intrinsic growth rate ($r_{C}$), the commensal's intraspecific competition coefficient ($a_{CC}$), and the suppression factor ($s$). The change is directly proportional to the competitive effect of the commensal on the pathogen ($a_{PC}$) and the magnitude of the commensal's unsuppressed growth ($r_{C} (1-s)$), and inversely proportional to the commensal's self-regulation ($a_{CC}$).
