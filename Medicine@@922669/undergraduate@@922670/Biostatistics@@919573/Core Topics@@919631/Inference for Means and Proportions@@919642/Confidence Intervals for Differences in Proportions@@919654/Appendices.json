The adjusted counts, denoted $\\tilde{x}_i$, and adjusted sample sizes, denoted $\\tilde{n}_i$, are used to compute adjusted proportions, $\\tilde{p}_i$.

Both the lower limit, $-0.3195$, and the upper limit, $0.04681$, are well within the valid range of $[-1, 1]$.\n\nThis observation reflects a general property of the Agresti–Caffo procedure. The adjustment guarantees that the adjusted proportions $\\tilde{p}_1$ and $\\tilde{p}_2$ are always strictly between $0$ and $1$. Specifically, $\\tilde{p}_i = (x_i+1)/(n_i+2)$ is bounded by $1/(n_i+2)$ and $(n_i+1)/(n_i+2)$. This prevents the variance terms, $\\tilde{p}_i(1-\\tilde{p}_i)/\\tilde{n}_i$, from becoming zero. In contrast, the unadjusted Wald interval for this problem would use $\\hat{p}_1 = 0/20 = 0$, causing the variance estimate for the first sample, $\\hat{p}_1(1-\\hat{p}_1)/n_1$, to be exactly $0$. This artificially reduces the standard error and leads to an overly narrow confidence interval. While the unadjusted Wald interval in this specific instance does not produce endpoints outside $[-1, 1]$, it is known to fail in other cases (e.g., producing an upper bound greater than $1$). The Agresti-Caffo interval significantly mitigates this problem; while it is not strictly guaranteed to produce endpoints within the $[-1, 1]$ range, it is far more stable and much less likely to do so than the unadjusted Wald interval, thus yielding more coherent results in practice.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -0.3195 & 0.04681 \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "4903883"}, {"introduction": "The estimation of the standard error is a critical step in constructing a confidence interval.

The problem states to use the \"standard normal critical value\", which implies this standard value.\n\n    *   **Width of the CI**:\n        The width of the CI is given by:\n        $$W = 2 \\times z_{\\alpha/2} \\times SE(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2)$$\n\n    *   **Case 1: Unpooled (Separate-Sample) Variance Estimator**:\n        The standard error is calculated using the individual sample proportions. This method is generally preferred as it does not assume $p_1 = p_2$.\n        *   The variance of the difference is $Var(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2) = Var(\\hat{p}_1) + Var(\\hat{p}_2) = \\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}$.\n        *   We estimate this variance using the sample proportions: $\\widehat{Var}(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2) = \\frac{\\hat{p}_1(1-\\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{\\hat{p}_2(1-\\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}$.\n        *   The unpooled standard error is $SE_{unpooled} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}_1(1-\\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{\\hat{p}_2(1-\\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}$.\n        *   Let's calculate the terms:\n            *   $\\hat{p}_1(1-\\hat{p}_1) = 0.3 \\times 0.7 = 0.21$.\n            *   $\\hat{p}_2(1-\\hat{p}_2) = \\frac{12}{90} \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{12}{90}\\right) = \\frac{2}{15} \\times \\frac{13}{15} = \\frac{26}{225}$.\n            *   $\\frac{\\hat{p}_1(1-\\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} = \\frac{0.21}{60} = \\frac{21/100}{60} = \\frac{21}{6000} = \\frac{7}{2000} = 0.0035$.\n            *   $\\frac{\\hat{p}_2(1-\\hat{p}_2)}{n_2} = \\frac{26/225}{90} = \\frac{26}{20250} = \\frac{13}{10125}$.\n        *   $SE_{unpooled}^2 = \\frac{7}{2000} + \\frac{13}{10125}$.\n        *   To add these fractions, we find a common denominator. $2000 = 2^4 \\cdot 5^3$ and $10125 = 3^4 \\cdot 5^3$. The least common multiple is $2^4 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 5^3 = 162000$.\n        *   $SE_{unpooled}^2 = \\frac{7 \\cdot 81}{162000} + \\frac{13 \\cdot 16}{162000} = \\frac{567 + 208}{162000} = \\frac{775}{162000} = \\frac{31}{6480}$.\n        *   $SE_{unpooled} = \\sqrt{\\frac{31}{6480}}$.\n        *   Width of the unpooled CI: $W_{unpooled} = 2 z_{0.025} SE_{unpooled}$.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Pooled Variance Estimator**:\n        This method uses a pooled proportion, $\\hat{p}_{pooled}$, which is an estimate of the common proportion $p$ under the assumption that $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n        *   First, we calculate the pooled proportion:\n            $$\\hat{p}_{pooled} = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{n_1 + n_2} = \\frac{18 + 12}{60 + 90} = \\frac{30}{150} = 0.2$$\n        *   The pooled standard error is:\n            $$SE_{pooled} = \\sqrt{\\hat{p}_{pooled}(1-\\hat{p}_{pooled})\\left(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}\\right)}$$\n        *   Let's calculate the terms:\n            *   $\\hat{p}_{pooled}(1-\\hat{p}_{pooled}) = 0.2 \\times 0.8 = 0.16$.\n            *   $\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2} = \\frac{1}{60} + \\frac{1}{90} = \\frac{3+2}{180} = \\frac{5}{180} = \\frac{1}{36}$.\n        *   $SE_{pooled}^2 = 0.16 \\times \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{16}{100} \\times \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{4}{100 \\times 9} = \\frac{1}{225}$.\n        *   $SE_{pooled} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{225}} = \\frac{1}{15}$.\n        *   Width of the pooled CI: $W_{pooled} = 2 z_{0.025} SE_{pooled}$.\n\n    *   **Quantify the Difference**:\n        The problem asks for the ratio of the total widths:\n        $$Ratio = \\frac{W_{unpooled}}{W_{pooled}}$$\n        The term $2 z_{0.025}$ is common to both numerator and denominator and thus cancels:\n        $$Ratio = \\frac{2 z_{0.025} SE_{unpooled}}{2 z_{0.025} SE_{pooled}} = \\frac{SE_{unpooled}}{SE_{pooled}}$$\n\n    *   **Calculate the Ratio**:\n        We substitute the exact expressions for the standard errors:\n        $$Ratio = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{31}{6480}}}{\\frac{1}{15}} = 15 \\sqrt{\\frac{31}{6480}}$$\n        To simplify, we can square the ratio:\n        $$Ratio^2 = 15^2 \\times \\frac{31}{6480} = 225 \\times \\frac{31}{6480}$$\n        We can simplify the fraction $\\frac{225}{6480}$ by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. $225 = 9 \\times 25$ and $6480 = 10 \\times 648 = 10 \\times 8 \\times 81 = 10 \\times 8 \\times 9 \\times 9$.\n        $$\\frac{225}{6480} = \\frac{9 \\times 25}{6480} = \\frac{25}{720} = \\frac{5}{144}$$\n        So,\n        $$Ratio^2 = \\frac{5}{144} \\times 31 = \\frac{155}{144}$$\n        Taking the square root gives the exact ratio:\n        $$Ratio = \\sqrt{\\frac{155}{144}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{155}}{12}$$\n\n    *   **Final Numerical Calculation**:\n        We now compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures as requested.\n        $$Ratio = \\frac{\\sqrt{155}}{12} \\approx \\frac{12.4498996}{12} \\approx 1.03749163$$\n        Rounding to four significant figures, we get $1.037$. The fifth significant digit is $4$, so we round down.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.037}\n$$", "id": "4903857"}]}
