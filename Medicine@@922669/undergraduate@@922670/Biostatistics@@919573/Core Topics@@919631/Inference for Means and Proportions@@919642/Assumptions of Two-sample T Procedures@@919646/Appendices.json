The intended inferential method is a $2$-sample $t$ procedure on the difference in group means. The validity of the pooled-variance $2$-sample $t$ test requires that, for small to moderate $n$, each group’s outcome distribution is approximately normal and the population variances are equal; when variances are unequal, a Welch-type $t$ procedure is appropriate. Before selecting a test, the researcher wants a principled workflow that uses quantile–quantile (Q–Q) plots, the Shapiro–Wilk normality test, Levene’s equal variances test, and the Brown–Forsythe equal variances test, and a justification of each tool’s sensitivity and specificity.\n\nBase definitions to keep in mind:\n- Sensitivity is the probability of correctly detecting a violated assumption when it is present, that is, $\\mathbb{P}(\\text{reject } H_0 \\mid H_1 \\text{ true})$.\n- Specificity is the probability of correctly not flagging a violation when the assumption holds, that is, $\\mathbb{P}(\\text{not reject } H_0 \\mid H_0 \\text{ true}) = 1 - \\alpha$ for a level-$\\alpha$ test.\n\nThe Shapiro–Wilk test evaluates $H_0$: “the sample is drawn from a normal distribution” and is known to be among the most powerful omnibus tests for normality across a range of non-normal alternatives for small to moderate $n$. Levene’s test assesses equality of variances by testing group differences in transformed deviations $|X_{ij} - \\bar{X}_j|$ (deviation from the group mean $\\bar{X}_j$), while Brown–Forsythe uses $|X_{ij} - \\tilde{X}_j|$ (deviation from the group median $\\tilde{X}_j$), making it more robust to skewness and outliers.\n\nWhich option best specifies a principled workflow and correctly justifies the relative sensitivity and specificity of these tools for checking assumptions prior to choosing a pooled-variance $2$-sample $t$ test versus a Welch-type $t$ test?\n\nA. Begin with Q–Q plots of each group to visually assess linearity: if points track the reference line with only mild tail departures, proceed to Shapiro–Wilk at $\\alpha = 0.05$ for each group, interpreting $p$-values with caution because with small to moderate $n$ the test may have limited sensitivity to subtle deviations but good specificity under true normality. For equal variances, first consult the Q–Q plots for evidence of skewness or outliers; if such features are present, use Brown–Forsythe because median-based deviations provide higher specificity (better type I error control) under non-normality with comparable sensitivity to variance differences, whereas Levene’s mean-based deviations can suffer inflated type I error under skewness.

Graphical methods provide crucial context that single $p$-values from formal tests cannot.\n2.  **Normality Assessment:** The $t$-test is reasonably robust to mild-to-moderate deviations from normality, particularly for symmetric distributions. The primary concerns are heavy skewness and the presence of outliers.\n    -   Q–Q plots are the standard graphical tool. For small samples, some deviation from the reference line is expected even under true normality.\n    -   The Shapiro–Wilk test is a powerful formal test for normality. Its null hypothesis is that the data *are* normal. A key issue is that for small $n$, its power (sensitivity) to detect non-normality is limited. Thus, a non-significant result ($p > \\alpha$) does not prove normality, it only signifies a failure to detect non-normality. The specificity of the test, $\\mathbb{P}(\\text{not reject } H_0 \\mid H_0 \\text{ true})$, is by definition equal to $1-\\alpha$.\n3.  **Homogeneity of Variance Assessment:** This assumption is critical for the pooled-variance $t$-test. Its violation can lead to significant inflation of the Type I error rate.\n    -   Levene’s test uses an ANOVA on the absolute deviations from the mean ($|X_{ij} - \\bar{X}_j|$). Because the mean is sensitive to skewness and outliers, Levene’s test can have an inflated Type I error rate (i.e., low specificity) when the underlying distributions are skewed, incorrectly rejecting the null of equal variances.\n    -   The Brown–Forsythe test modifies Levene's test by using the absolute deviations from the median ($|X_{ij} - \\tilde{X}_j|$). Since the median is robust to skewness and outliers, this test maintains better control over the Type I error rate (i.e., has better specificity) in the presence of non-normality. It is therefore generally preferred over Levene’s test, especially if there is any doubt about the symmetry of the distributions.\n    -   Bartlett's test is another option, but it is highly sensitive to non-normality and should only be used when the data are known to be normally distributed.\n4.  **Decision Logic:** Based on the assumption checks, a decision is made. If normality is plausible and variances are deemed equal, the pooled $t$-test is used. If normality is plausible but variances are unequal, the Welch $t$-test is the appropriate choice. The Welch test is generally a safer default, as its performance is close to the pooled test when variances are equal and far superior when they are not.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n**A. Begin with Q–Q plots of each group to visually assess linearity: if points track the reference line with only mild tail departures, proceed to Shapiro–Wilk at $\\alpha = 0.05$ for each group, interpreting $p$-values with caution because with small to moderate $n$ the test may have limited sensitivity to subtle deviations but good specificity under true normality. For equal variances, first consult the Q–Q plots for evidence of skewness or outliers; if such features are present, use Brown–Forsythe because median-based deviations provide higher specificity (better type I error control) under non-normality with comparable sensitivity to variance differences, whereas Levene’s mean-based deviations can suffer inflated type I error under skewness. If normality appears plausible and no outliers are evident, Levene is acceptable. Choose the pooled $t$ if equal variances are not rejected; otherwise use Welch’s $t$.**\nThis option describes a comprehensive and statistically sound workflow.\n-   It correctly prioritizes visual inspection with Q–Q plots.\n-   It provides a correct and nuanced interpretation of the Shapiro–Wilk test, acknowledging its limited sensitivity with small $n$ and its defined specificity ($1-\\alpha$).\n-   It correctly links the choice between Levene's and Brown–Forsythe's tests to the shape of the distribution (skewness/outliers) noted from the initial visual checks.\n-   The justification for preferring Brown–Forsythe (robustness, better Type I error control/specificity under non-normality) is correct.\n-   The final decision logic is consistent with the goal of the problem.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Skip Q–Q plots and rely exclusively on Shapiro–Wilk with $\\alpha = 0.10$ to “increase both sensitivity and specificity” for normality screening. For variances, always prefer Levene because it is more sensitive than Brown–Forsythe, and always use the pooled $t$ test whenever the Levene $p$-value exceeds $0.10$.**\nThis option contains multiple fundamental errors.\n-   Skipping graphical checks is poor statistical practice.\n-   The statement that increasing $\\alpha$ increases both sensitivity and specificity is false. Increasing the significance level $\\alpha$ from, for example, $0.05$ to $0.10$ increases the test's sensitivity (power) but *decreases* its specificity, which is $1-\\alpha$ (from $0.95$ to $0.90$).\n-   \"Always prefer Levene\" is poor advice; the Brown–Forsythe test is generally more robust and often preferred. The claim that Levene is more sensitive is an oversimplification that ignores its critical lack of robustness (poor specificity) in non-normal situations.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. After Q–Q plots, if any deviation from linearity is seen, immediately transform the data and do not perform Shapiro–Wilk because it lacks sensitivity for moderate $n$. For variances, always use Bartlett’s test because it has the highest specificity regardless of distributional shape, and use the pooled $t$ test whenever Bartlett’s $p$-value exceeds $0.05$.**\nThis option is based on flawed reasoning and incorrect facts.\n-   Recommending immediate transformation for *any* deviation on a Q–Q plot is too aggressive, as small-sample plots are rarely perfect.\n-   The claim that Bartlett's test has \"the highest specificity regardless of distributional shape\" is factually wrong. Bartlett's test is notoriously sensitive to departures from normality, meaning it has poor specificity when the data are not normal.\n-   The reasoning for not using Shapiro–Wilk is weak; its limitations call for caution, not complete avoidance in a thorough assessment.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Use Q–Q plots followed by Shapiro–Wilk. If non-normality is detected, switch to the Mann–Whitney test. For variances, run both Levene and Brown–Forsythe but prefer Levene when outliers are present because mean-based deviations “emphasize extremes” and thus increase sensitivity, and note that Q–Q plots have low specificity so they should be down-weighted in decisions about normality.**\nThis option contains incorrect justifications.\n-   The advice to \"prefer Levene when outliers are present\" is backwards and dangerous. The mean's sensitivity to outliers is exactly why Levene's test is *not* robust and can lead to spurious rejections of the equal-variance hypothesis (low specificity). The robust Brown–Forsythe test is the correct choice in the presence of outliers.\n-   Applying the formal term \"specificity\" to a graphical plot is imprecise. More importantly, advising that Q–Q plots should be \"down-weighted\" is contrary to good practice; visual diagnostics are essential for understanding data and providing context for formal tests.\n-   While switching to a Mann–Whitney test is a possible strategy, the core of the variance-test justification is critically flawed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4895839"}, {"introduction": "While the two-sample t-test is famously robust against moderate deviations from normality, this resilience is not infinite.

These principles justify the approximation of the $T$ statistic's distribution by a standard normal distribution (or a Student's $t$ distribution, which converges to normal) for large $n$.\n\nThe core of the large-sample argument is that the $T$ statistic converges in distribution to a standard normal random variable, $N(0,1)$. This requires two main conditions to be met for the components of the statistic:\n\n1.  **Asymptotic Normality of the Numerator:**\n    The numerator is $\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2$. According to the Lindeberg-Lévy Central Limit Theorem, for a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with a finite mean $E[X]$ and a finite variance $Var(X) = \\sigma^2$, the sample mean is asymptotically normal. Specifically, $\\sqrt{n}(\\bar{X} - E[X]) \\xrightarrow{d} N(0, \\sigma^2)$. Applying this to both samples, it follows that $\\sqrt{n}(\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2)$ is asymptotically normal.\n    The crucial requirement for the CLT is the existence of a **finite population variance $\\sigma^2$**.\n    A Student's $t$-distribution with $\\nu$ degrees of freedom has a defined, finite variance if and only if its second moment exists. The $k$-th moment of a Student's $t$-distribution is finite only for $k < \\nu$. Therefore, for the variance (second moment, $k=2$) to be finite, we must have $\\nu > 2$. The mean (first moment, $k=1$) is finite for $\\nu > 1$, a less strict condition. Thus, the CLT applies to the numerator if $\\nu > 2$.\n\n2.  **Consistency of the Denominator:**\n    The denominator involves the pooled sample variance, $S_p^2$. For the overall $T$ statistic to have the correct asymptotic distribution, $S_p^2$ must be a consistent estimator of the true population variance $\\sigma^2$. This means $S_p^2$ must converge in probability to $\\sigma^2$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n    By the Weak Law of Large Numbers, the sample moment $\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i^k$ converges in probability to the population moment $E[X^k]$, provided $E[X^k]$ is finite. The sample variance $S^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum(X_i-\\bar{X})^2$ is a function of the first and second sample moments. Its consistency for $\\sigma^2$ requires that both $E[X]$ and $E[X^2]$ are finite. As $E[X^2] = \\sigma^2 + (E[X])^2$, the condition for consistency reduces to requiring a finite mean and a finite variance. This, again, leads to the condition $\\nu > 2$.\n\nIf we only consider these two conditions, the minimal integer value for $\\nu$ would be $3$. However, the problem emphasizes the \"heavy-tailed\" nature of the distribution and requires that the Studentized statistic be \"well-behaved\". This phrasing suggests that mere asymptotic convergence may not be sufficient, and the stability of the estimators at finite sample sizes ($n=30$) is a key consideration.\n\nA statistician's interpretation of a \"well-behaved\" variance estimator, particularly in the context of heavy-tailed data, includes not just its consistency but also the stability of its sampling distribution. A highly variable estimator for $\\sigma^2$ can lead to poor performance of the $t$-test, where some samples yield a spuriously small $S_p^2$, inflating the $T$ statistic and causing the actual type I error rate to exceed the nominal level $\\alpha$. The stability of the sample variance estimator $S^2$ is governed by its own variance, $Var(S^2)$.\n\nThe asymptotic variance of the sample variance $S^2$ is given by:\n$$ Var(S^2) \\approx \\frac{1}{n} \\left( E[(X-\\mu)^4] - \\sigma^4 \\right) $$\nFor $Var(S^2)$ to be finite, the fourth central moment of the underlying distribution, $E[(X-\\mu)^4]$, must be finite. A finite variance of the variance estimator ensures that $S^2$ does not fluctuate too wildly from sample to sample, thus providing a more reliable \"Studentization\" of the mean difference.\n\nWe must therefore find the condition on $\\nu$ that ensures the fourth moment of the Student's $t$-distribution is finite. As stated earlier, the $k$-th moment is finite if and only if $k < \\nu$. To ensure a finite fourth moment ($k=4$), we must impose the condition:\n$$ \\nu > 4 $$\nThis more stringent condition guarantees that the variance of the pooled variance estimator is finite, thereby ensuring it is \"well-behaved\" in the sense required for robust test performance with heavy-tailed data. This condition $\\nu > 4$ implies $\\nu > 2$, so it naturally incorporates the less strict requirements for the CLT and WLLN.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimal integer value of $\\nu$ that satisfies this criterion. The smallest integer $\\nu$ that is strictly greater than $4$ is $5$.\nTherefore, for the pooled $t$-test to be considered robust and its assumptions plausibly satisfied under the specified conditions, the degrees of freedom of the underlying heavy-tailed data distribution must be at least $5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "4895838"}, {"introduction": "The assumption of equal variances is a key distinction between the pooled and Welch t-tests.

We can solve this constrained optimization problem by substituting the constraint into the objective function. From the constraint, we have $n_2 = N - n_1$. Substituting this into the variance expression yields a function of a single variable, $n_1$:\n$$ V(n_1) = \\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{N - n_1} $$\nTo find the value of $n_1$ that minimizes $V$, we take the first derivative of $V(n_1)$ with respect to $n_1$ and set it to zero. The domain for $n_1$ is $(0, N)$.\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dn_1} = \\frac{d}{dn_1} \\left( \\sigma_1^2 n_1^{-1} + \\sigma_2^2 (N - n_1)^{-1} \\right) = -\\sigma_1^2 n_1^{-2} - \\sigma_2^2 (N - n_1)^{-2} (-1) $$\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dn_1} = -\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1^2} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{(N - n_1)^2} $$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find the critical point:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{(N - n_1)^2} = \\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1^2} $$\nSince standard deviations $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2$ are non-negative and sample sizes $n_1, n_2$ are positive, we can take the square root of both sides:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_2}{N - n_1} = \\frac{\\sigma_1}{n_1} $$\nNow, we solve for $n_1$:\n$$ n_1 \\sigma_2 = (N - n_1) \\sigma_1 = N\\sigma_1 - n_1\\sigma_1 $$\n$$ n_1 \\sigma_2 + n_1 \\sigma_1 = N\\sigma_1 $$\n$$ n_1 (\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2) = N\\sigma_1 $$\n$$ n_1 = N \\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2} $$\nTo confirm that this is a minimum, we can check the second derivative:\n$$ \\frac{d^2V}{dn_1^2} = \\frac{d}{dn_1} \\left( -\\sigma_1^2 n_1^{-2} + \\sigma_2^2 (N - n_1)^{-2} \\right) = 2\\sigma_1^2 n_1^{-3} + 2\\sigma_2^2(N-n_1)^{-3} $$\nSince $\\sigma_1^2, \\sigma_2^2, n_1, N-n_1$ are all positive, $\\frac{d^2V}{dn_1^2} > 0$, confirming the critical point corresponds to a minimum.\n\nNow we find the optimal value for $n_2$ using the constraint $n_2 = N - n_1$:\n$$ n_2 = N - N \\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2} = N \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2} \\right) = N \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2 - \\sigma_1}{\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2} \\right) $$\n$$ n_2 = N \\frac{\\sigma_2}{\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2} $$\nThis result, known as Neyman allocation, indicates that the optimal sample size for each group is proportional to its population standard deviation.\n\nThe optimal allocation vector $(n_1, n_2)$ is therefore:\n$$ \\left( N \\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2}, N \\frac{\\sigma_2}{\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2} \\right) $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nN \\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2} & N \\frac{\\sigma_2}{\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4895832"}]}
