It is a standard, well-posed question in biostatistics that can be solved using fundamental principles of statistical theory. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem asks for a comparison of two confidence intervals for the population mean $\\mu$ based on a sample of size $n$ from a $N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ distribution, where both $\\mu$ and $\\sigma^2$ are unknown.\n\nThe first interval, which we will denote $CI_t$, is the standard, theoretically correct two-sided $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for $\\mu$ when $\\sigma^2$ is unknown. It is constructed using the sample mean $\\bar{X}$, the sample standard deviation $S$, and a critical value from the Student's $t$ distribution with $\\nu = n-1$ degrees of freedom. The quantity $\\frac{\\bar{X}-\\mu}{S/\\sqrt{n}}$ follows a $t$ distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom. The critical value, denoted $t_{n-1, 1-\\alpha/2}$, is the upper $(1-\\alpha/2)$ quantile of the distribution, i.e., $P(T_{n-1} \\le t_{n-1, 1-\\alpha/2}) = 1-\\alpha/2$, where $T_{n-1}$ is a random variable following the $t$ distribution.\nThe interval is given by:\n$$ CI_t: \\bar{X} \\pm t_{n-1, 1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}} $$\nThe length of this interval, $L_t$, is twice the margin of error:\n$$ L_t = 2 \\cdot t_{n-1, 1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}} $$\n\nThe second interval, which we will denote $CI_z$, is a non-standard interval that incorrectly uses a critical value from the standard normal distribution, $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$, while still using the sample standard deviation $S$ to estimate $\\sigma$. This interval would be correct only if $\\sigma$ were known and $S$ were replaced by $\\sigma$. The critical value $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the upper $(1-\\alpha/2)$ quantile, where $P(Z \\le z_{1-\\alpha/2}) = 1-\\alpha/2$ for a standard normal random variable $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$.\nThe interval is given by:\n$$ CI_z: \\bar{X} \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}} $$\nThe length of this interval, $L_z$, is:\n$$ L_z = 2 \\cdot z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}} $$\n\nTo justify which of the two CIs is longer for a finite sample size $n$, we compare their lengths, $L_t$ and $L_z$. The comparison depends on the relative magnitudes of the critical values $t_{n-1, 1-\\alpha/2}$ and $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$.\n\nA fundamental property of the Student's $t$ distribution is that its probability density function has heavier tails than the standard normal distribution for any finite degrees of freedom $\\nu$. This means the $t$ distribution is more spread out to account for the additional uncertainty introduced by estimating the population variance $\\sigma^2$ with the sample variance $S^2$. To capture the same central probability of $(1-\\alpha)$, the critical values for the $t$ distribution must be larger than those for the standard normal distribution.\nTherefore, for any finite $n > 1$ (which implies degrees of freedom $\\nu = n-1 \\ge 1$) and any confidence level $(1-\\alpha)$ where $\\alpha \\in (0, 1)$, the following inequality holds:\n$$ t_{n-1, 1-\\alpha/2} > z_{1-\\alpha/2} $$\nAs the sample size $n$ approaches infinity, the sample standard deviation $S$ converges to the population standard deviation $\\sigma$, and the $t$ distribution converges in distribution to the standard normal distribution. Consequently, $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} t_{n-1, 1-\\alpha/2} = z_{1-\\alpha/2}$.\n\nSince $L_t$ and $L_z$ share the common factor $2 \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}}$, and we have established that $t_{n-1, 1-\\alpha/2} > z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ for finite $n$, it follows directly that:\n$$ L_t > L_z $$\nThus, the confidence interval based on the Student's $t$ distribution ($CI_t$) is always longer than the one incorrectly using a normal critical value with the sample standard deviation ($CI_z$) for any finite sample size.\n\nNext, we derive the exact expression for the ratio of their lengths, $R$, as a function of $n$ and $\\alpha$.\n$$ R = \\frac{L_t}{L_z} = \\frac{2 \\cdot t_{n-1, 1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}}}{2 \\cdot z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}}} $$\nThe common terms cancel, leaving the ratio of the critical values:\n$$ R(n, \\alpha) = \\frac{t_{n-1, 1-\\alpha/2}}{z_{1-\\alpha/2}} $$\nThis is the exact expression for the ratio.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this ratio for the specific case where $n=15$ and the confidence level is $1-\\alpha=0.95$.\nGiven $1-\\alpha=0.95$, we have $\\alpha=0.05$, and for a two-sided interval, $1-\\alpha/2=0.975$.\nThe degrees of freedom are $\\nu = n-1 = 15-1 = 14$.\n\nWe need to find the critical values $z_{0.975}$ and $t_{14, 0.975}$.\n\nThe critical value $z_{0.975}$ is the value from the standard normal distribution such that the area to its left is $0.975$. From standard statistical tables or software, this value is:\n$$ z_{0.975} \\approx 1.959964 $$\n\nThe critical value $t_{14, 0.975}$ is the value from the Student's $t$ distribution with $14$ degrees of freedom such that the area to its left is $0.975$. From statistical tables or software for the $t$ distribution, this value is:\n$$ t_{14, 0.975} \\approx 2.144787 $$\n\nNow, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{t_{14, 0.975}}{z_{0.975}} \\approx \\frac{2.144787}{1.959964} \\approx 1.094300... $$\n\nThe problem asks to round the final numerical answer to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1.094$. The fifth digit is $3$, so we round down.\nThe final numerical ratio is $1.094$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.094}$$", "id": "4902423"}, {"introduction": "Building on the theoretical difference between $t$ and $z$ critical values, this exercise applies the concept to the practical task of study planning.

We are given a planning value for the population standard deviation, $s_{p}=12$, from a pilot study.\n\n**1. Derivation of Planning Inequalities**\n\nLet $\\bar{X}$ be the sample mean and $S$ be the sample standard deviation calculated from a future sample of size $n$. The population mean and standard deviation are $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$, respectively.\n\n**a) Inequality based on the Normal Approximation (z-score)**\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that for a large sample size $n$, the statistic $Z = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu}{S/\\sqrt{n}}$ is approximately distributed as a standard normal variable, $N(0,1)$. Using this approximation, a $(1-\\alpha) \\times 100\\%$ confidence interval for $\\mu$ is constructed as $\\bar{X} \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}}$, where $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the upper $(1-\\alpha/2)$ quantile of the standard normal distribution.\n\nThe half-width of this interval is $H = z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}}$. For planning, we require that this half-width be no more than the target value $W$. We replace the unknown future sample standard deviation $S$ with our planning estimate $s_p$. The planning inequality is:\n$$z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{s_p}{\\sqrt{n}} \\le W$$\nSolving for $n$, we obtain the planning inequality for the normal approximation approach:\n$$n \\ge \\left( \\frac{z_{1-\\alpha/2} s_p}{W} \\right)^2$$\n\n**b) Inequality based on the Exact Student's t-distribution**\n\nGiven the problem's assumption that the data are normally distributed, the pivotal quantity $T = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu}{S/\\sqrt{n}}$ follows an exact Student's t-distribution with $\\nu = n-1$ degrees of freedom. This is the correct procedure when the population variance is unknown, regardless of sample size.\n\nThe exact $(1-\\alpha) \\times 100\\%$ confidence interval for $\\mu$ is $\\bar{X} \\pm t_{n-1, 1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}}$, where $t_{n-1, 1-\\alpha/2}$ is the upper $(1-\\alpha/2)$ quantile of the t-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.\n\nThe half-width of this interval is $H = t_{n-1, 1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}}$. Setting the planning requirement $H \\le W$ and using $s_p$ as the estimate for the future $S$, we get:\n$$t_{n-1, 1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{s_p}{\\sqrt{n}} \\le W$$\nSolving for $n$ gives the planning inequality for the t-distribution approach:\n$$n \\ge \\left( \\frac{t_{n-1, 1-\\alpha/2} s_p}{W} \\right)^2$$\nNote that this inequality must be solved iteratively or by search, as $n$ appears on both sides (explicitly on the left and implicitly in the degrees of freedom of the t-critical value on the right).\n\n**2.

The problem consists of two independent parts, which will be addressed sequentially.\n\nPart 1: Evaluation of the Influence Function for the Sample Mean\n\nThe influence function, $IF(z; T, F)$, measures the effect of an infinitesimal contamination at a point $z$ on a statistical functional $T$ evaluated at a distribution $F$. It is defined by the limit:\n$$ IF(z; T, F) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\frac{T(F_\\epsilon) - T(F)}{\\epsilon} $$\nwhere $F_\\epsilon$ is the contaminated distribution, given by a mixture of the original distribution $F$ and a point mass at $z$:\n$$ F_\\epsilon = (1-\\epsilon)F + \\epsilon \\delta_z $$\nHere, $\\delta_z$ represents the Dirac delta measure which places a probability mass of $1$ at the point $z$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the estimator for a population mean is treated as a statistical functional, $T$, which maps a distribution $F$ to its expectation. Let the random variable be $X$. The functional is thus:\n$$ T(F) = \\mathbb{E}_F[X] = \\int x \\, dF(x) $$\nLet the mean of the distribution $F$ be $\\mu$, so $T(F) = \\mu$.\n\nTo find the influence function, we first evaluate the functional $T$ at the contaminated distribution $F_\\epsilon$:\n$$ T(F_\\epsilon) = \\mathbb{E}_{F_\\epsilon}[X] = \\int x \\, dF_\\epsilon(x) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $F_\\epsilon$:\n$$ T(F_\\epsilon) = \\int x \\, d((1-\\epsilon)F + \\epsilon \\delta_z) $$\nBy the linearity of the integral, we can separate the terms:\n$$ T(F_\\epsilon) = (1-\\epsilon) \\int x \\, dF(x) + \\epsilon \\int x \\, d\\delta_z(x) $$\nThe first integral is the expectation of $X$ under $F$, which is $T(F) = \\mu$. The second integral is the expectation with respect to the point mass at $z$, which evaluates to $z$. Therefore:\n$$ T(F_\\epsilon) = (1-\\epsilon)\\mu + \\epsilon z $$\n\nNow, we substitute this result back into the definition of the influence function:\n$$ IF(z; T, F) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\frac{((1-\\epsilon)\\mu + \\epsilon z) - \\mu}{\\epsilon} $$\nExpanding the numerator:\n$$ IF(z; T, F) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\frac{\\mu - \\epsilon\\mu + \\epsilon z - \\mu}{\\epsilon} $$\n$$ IF(z; T, F) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\frac{\\epsilon (z - \\mu)}{\\epsilon} $$\n$$ IF(z; T, F) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} (z - \\mu) $$\nThe expression is independent of $\\epsilon$, so the limit is simply:\n$$ IF(z; T, F) = z - \\mu $$\nThis result shows that the influence of a contaminating point $z$ on the sample mean is its deviation from the true population mean $\\mu$. The influence is unbounded, meaning that an observation very far from the mean can have an arbitrarily large effect on the estimate.\n\nPart 2: Computation of the Widening Factor for a Confidence Interval\n\nThe two-sided $100(1-\\alpha)\\%$ Student's $t$ confidence interval for the population mean $\\mu$ is given by:\n$$ \\bar{x} \\pm t_{1-\\alpha/2, n-1} \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} $$\nwhere $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, $s$ is the sample standard deviation, $n$ is the sample size, and $t_{1-\\alpha/2, n-1}$ is the critical value from the $t$-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.\n\nThe half-width of this interval is $w = t_{1-\\alpha/2, n-1} \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}$. We are asked to find the factor by which this half-width is widened due to a data replacement. Let $w_0$ and $s_0$ be the half-width and sample standard deviation for the original (unperturbed) data, and let $w'$ and $s'$ be the corresponding quantities for the new (perturbed) data. The widening factor is the ratio $\\frac{w'}{w_0}$.\n\nSince the sample size $n=25$ and the confidence level ($95\\%$, so $\\alpha=0.05$) remain unchanged, the degrees of freedom ($n-1=24$) and the critical value $t_{1-\\alpha/2, n-1}$ are the same for both calculations. The widening factor thus simplifies to the ratio of the sample standard deviations:\n$$ \\text{Widening Factor} = \\frac{w'}{w_0} = \\frac{t_{0.975, 24} \\frac{s'}{\\sqrt{25}}}{t_{0.975, 24} \\frac{s_0}{\\sqrt{25}}} = \\frac{s'}{s_0} $$\n\nThe sample variance, $s^2$, is calculated using the formula:\n$$ s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{2} - \\frac{(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i})^2}{n} \\right) $$\n\nFor the original data (subscript $0$):\n$n_0 = 25$\n$\\sum x_{i,0} = 2500$\n$\\sum x_{i,0}^2 = 253456$\n\nThe original sample variance $s_0^2$ is:\n$$ s_0^2 = \\frac{1}{25-1} \\left( 253456 - \\frac{(2500)^2}{25} \\right) = \\frac{1}{24} \\left( 253456 - \\frac{6250000}{25} \\right) $$\n$$ s_0^2 = \\frac{1}{24} (253456 - 250000) = \\frac{3456}{24} = 144 $$\nThe original sample standard deviation is $s_0 = \\sqrt{144} = 12$.\n\nFor the perturbed data (superscript $'$), one value of $x_{old}=100$ is replaced by $x_{new}=220$.

We must update the sum and the sum of squares.\n\nThe new sum of values is:\n$$ \\sum x_i' = \\sum x_{i,0} - x_{old} + x_{new} = 2500 - 100 + 220 = 2620 $$\nThe new sum of squares is:\n$$ \\sum (x_i')^2 = \\sum x_{i,0}^2 - x_{old}^2 + x_{new}^2 = 253456 - 100^2 + 220^2 $$\n$$ \\sum (x_i')^2 = 253456 - 10000 + 48400 = 291856 $$\n\nThe new sample variance $s'^2$ is:\n$$ s'^2 = \\frac{1}{25-1} \\left( 291856 - \\frac{(2620)^2}{25} \\right) = \\frac{1}{24} \\left( 291856 - \\frac{6864400}{25} \\right) $$\n$$ s'^2 = \\frac{1}{24} (291856 - 274576) = \\frac{17280}{24} = 720 $$\nThe new sample standard deviation is $s' = \\sqrt{720} = \\sqrt{144 \\times 5} = 12\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nFinally, the widening factor is the ratio $\\frac{s'}{s_0}$:\n$$ \\text{Widening Factor} = \\frac{12\\sqrt{5}}{12} = \\sqrt{5} $$\nThe problem requests this value rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.2360679... $$\nRounding yields $2.236$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} z - \\mu & 2.236 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4902392"}]}
