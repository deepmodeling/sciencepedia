Overlap of group-wise $95\\%$ CIs does not preclude a statistically significant difference, because the variability of the difference of independent sample means depends on the sum of their mean-estimate variances rather than the overlap of separate intervals; the correct procedure is the unequal-variance two-sample $t$-test (Welch’s), and the $95\\%$ CI for $\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2$ is approximately $(1.0, 7.0)$, which excludes $0$.\n\n- C.

This is consistent with the reported $[5.6, 10.4]$.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a valid problem. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\n**Part 1: Conceptual Analysis of Overlapping Confidence Intervals**\nA common misconception is that if the individual $95\\%$ CIs for two means ($\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$) overlap, then the difference between the means is not statistically significant at the $\\alpha = 0.05$ level. This is incorrect.\n\nLet the CI for $\\mu_1$ be $\\bar{x}_1 \\pm M_1$ and for $\\mu_2$ be $\\bar{x}_2 \\pm M_2$, where $M_1$ and $M_2$ are the respective margins of error. Overlap occurs if the distance between the means, $|\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2|$, is less than the sum of the half-widths of the CIs, $M_1 + M_2$.\nThe CI for the difference of the means, $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2$, is given by $(\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2) \\pm M_{diff}$. A statistically significant difference at level $\\alpha$ is found if this interval does not contain $0$, which requires $|\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2| > M_{diff}$.\n\nThe crucial point is the relationship between $M_1+M_2$ and $M_{diff}$.\nThe margins of error are $M_1 \\approx z_{\\alpha/2} \\frac{s_1}{\\sqrt{n_1}}$ and $M_2 \\approx z_{\\alpha/2} \\frac{s_2}{\\sqrt{n_2}}$.\nFor independent samples, the variances of the sample means add: $Var(\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2) = Var(\\bar{X}_1) + Var(\\bar{X}_2) = \\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}$.\nThe standard error of the difference is thus $SE_{diff} = \\sqrt{\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}$.\nThe margin of error for the difference is $M_{diff} \\approx z_{\\alpha/2} \\times SE_{diff} = z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{ \\left(\\frac{s_1}{\\sqrt{n_1}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{s_2}{\\sqrt{n_2}}\\right)^2 }$.\n\nCompare the sum of individual margins of error with the margin of error of the difference:\n$$ M_1 + M_2 = z_{\\alpha/2} \\left( \\frac{s_1}{\\sqrt{n_1}} + \\frac{s_2}{\\sqrt{n_2}} \\right) $$\n$$ M_{diff} = z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{ \\left(\\frac{s_1}{\\sqrt{n_1}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{s_2}{\\sqrt{n_2}}\\right)^2 } $$\nFor any two positive numbers $a$ and $b$, we know from the geometry of a right triangle that $a+b > \\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$. Therefore, $M_1 + M_2 > M_{diff}$.\n\nThis inequality shows that the condition for overlap ($|\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2| < M_1 + M_2$) is less strict than the condition for non-significance ($|\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2| < M_{diff}$). It is therefore possible for the CIs to overlap ($M_{diff} < |\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2| < M_1 + M_2$) while the difference is still statistically significant. The overlap of CIs is not a definitive guide to the significance of the difference. The correct approach is to construct the CI for the difference directly.\n\n**Part 2: Appropriate Inferential Procedure and Calculation**\n-   The two groups are independent.\n-   The population variances, $\\sigma_1^2$ and $\\sigma_2^2$, are unknown and estimated by the sample variances, $s_1^2$ and $s_2^2$. The sample variances are not equal ($s_1^2 = 100$, $s_2^2 = 144$).\n-   Without the assumption of equal population variances, the appropriate procedure is the **unequal-variance two-sample $t$-test**, also known as **Welch's $t$-test**. The sample sizes are large ($n_1=120, n_2=100$), ensuring the sampling distribution of the difference in means is approximately normal by the Central Limit Theorem.\n\nLet's compute the $95\\%$ CI for the difference $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2$.\n1.  **Point Estimate:** The difference in sample means is $\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2 = 12.0 - 8.0 = 4.0$.\n\n2.  **Standard Error of the Difference:**\n    $$ SE_{diff} = \\sqrt{\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{10.0^2}{120} + \\frac{12.0^2}{100}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100}{120} + \\frac{144}{100}} = \\sqrt{0.8333... + 1.44} = \\sqrt{2.2733...} \\approx 1.5078 $$\n\n3.  **Degrees of Freedom (Welch-Satterthwaite equation):**\n    $$ \\nu \\approx \\frac{\\left(\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}\\right)^2}{\\frac{\\left(s_1^2/n_1\\right)^2}{n_1-1} + \\frac{\\left(s_2^2/n_2\\right)^2}{n_2-1}} = \\frac{(2.2733...)^2}{\\frac{(0.8333...)^2}{119} + \\frac{(1.44)^2}{99}} \\approx \\frac{5.168}{0.005835 + 0.020945} = \\frac{5.168}{0.02678} \\approx 192.98 $$\n    We can use $\\nu = 193$.\n\n4.  **Critical Value:** For a $95\\%$ CI, we need the critical value $t_{\\nu, \\alpha/2} = t_{193, 0.025}$. Since $\\nu$ is large, this value is close to the standard normal critical value $z_{0.025}=1.96$. A precise value is $t_{193, 0.025} \\approx 1.972$.\n\n5.  **Confidence Interval:**\n    The $95\\%$ CI is $(\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2) \\pm t_{\\nu, 0.025} \\times SE_{diff}$.\n    $$ CI = 4.0 \\pm 1.972 \\times 1.5078 $$\n    $$ CI = 4.0 \\pm 2.9734 $$\n    $$ CI \\approx [1.0266, 6.9734] $$\n    Rounding to one decimal place, the CI is approximately $[1.0, 7.0]$. Since this interval does not contain $0$, the difference in mean LDL-C reduction is statistically significant at the $\\alpha = 0.05$ level.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **A.** This option claims that overlapping CIs imply non-significance, which is conceptually **Incorrect**. It recommends a pooled $t$-test, which is less appropriate than Welch's test without an equal-variance assumption. Its calculated CI of $[-0.8, 8.8]$ is numerically **Incorrect**.\n\n- **B.** This option correctly states that CI overlap does not preclude significance and accurately explains that the variance of the difference is the sum of the variances of the individual mean estimates. This is conceptually **Correct**. It recommends Welch's $t$-test, which is the appropriate procedure. This is procedurally **Correct**. Its calculated CI of approximately $(1.0, 7.0)$ matches our derivation. This is numerically **Correct**. The conclusion that the interval excludes $0$ is also correct.\n\n- **C.** This option suggests using a normal $z$-test. This is formally **Incorrect** because the population standard deviations are unknown; a $t$-test is the correct procedure, although for large samples the result is similar. The given CI of $(0.5, 7.5)$ is numerically **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D.** This option makes a nonsensical claim about the Type I error rate. Crucially, it recommends a paired $t$-test, which is fundamentally **Incorrect** as the problem clearly states the groups are independent. The calculation is irrelevant as the choice of test is wrong.\n\n- **E.** This option begins with a false premise, claiming that overlapping $95\\%$ CIs are \"exactly equivalent\" to non-significance when sample sizes and variances are equal. This is mathematically **Incorrect**. It then makes an invalid deduction from this false premise. While it correctly suggests Welch's $t$-test, its calculated CI of $(-0.2, 8.2)$ is numerically **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a thorough analysis, Option B provides the correct conceptual explanation, identifies the correct statistical procedure, and presents the correct calculated result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4854963"}]}
