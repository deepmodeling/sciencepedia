This exercise provides practice in this foundational skill, using an intuitive ecological scenario involving bee foraging. By considering a suspected change in the environment, you will learn to correctly formulate the null hypothesis ($H_0$) to represent the established baseline and the alternative hypothesis ($H_A$) to capture the specific research claim being investigated. [@problem_id:1940615]", "problem": "An entomologist is studying the foraging behavior of a particular species of honeybee. The number of flowers a bee visits until it successfully finds one with nectar can be modeled by a random variable $X$ following a geometric distribution with a parameter $p$, where $p$ is the probability of success (finding nectar) at any single flower.\n\nFor years, it was assumed that the bees' environment provided a stable nectar probability of $p=0.3$. However, due to recent changes in local flora, the entomologist suspects that the foraging has become more difficult, meaning the success probability has decreased. The entomologist decides to conduct a statistical test to determine if there is significant evidence for this suspicion.\n\nYour task is to formulate the null hypothesis ($H_0$) and the alternative hypothesis ($H_A$) for testing the claim that the success probability $p$ is now less than 0.3.

The exercise highlights that the structure of the alternative hypothesis is directly tied to the pre-registered criteria for what constitutes a meaningful or successful outcome.

The use of log-transformed expression values, hypothesis testing, and the distinction between one-sided and two-sided tests are all fundamental concepts in biostatistics. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear decision rule and asks for the correct statistical hypothesis formulation that aligns with this rule. A unique, correct formulation can be derived from these premises. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, objective language. The decision criterion is unambiguous. The problem is objective.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** All necessary information to formulate the hypotheses is provided. There are no internal contradictions.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with a full derivation and evaluation.\n\nThe fundamental principle of hypothesis testing is to formulate hypotheses before observing the data, based on the scientific question and the decisions that will be made as a result of the test. The problem explicitly states that \"the null hypothesis represents no efficacy-relevant effect and the alternative represents the effect of interest.\"\n\nThe \"effect of interest,\" which would trigger a \"go\" decision, is defined by the primary decision rule: \"statistically significant evidence that the oncogene’s mean expression is lower under treatment than under control.\" Mathematically, this translates to $\\mu_{\\mathrm{t}}  \\mu_{\\mathrm{c}}$. Expressed in terms of the parameter of interest, $\\Delta = \\mu_{\\mathrm{t}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{c}}$, this is equivalent to $\\Delta  0$. Therefore, the alternative hypothesis, $H_A$, which represents the effect of interest, must be:\n$$H_A: \\Delta  0$$\n\nThe null hypothesis, $H_0$, represents the absence of the effect of interest. It is the logical complement of the alternative hypothesis. If the alternative is $\\Delta  0$, then the null hypothesis must cover all other possibilities, namely that the treatment either has no effect or increases the expression of the oncogene. This is stated as \"no efficacy-relevant effect.\" An increase in expression is explicitly not considered efficacious. Thus, the null hypothesis is $\\Delta \\ge 0$.\nThe correct hypothesis pair for the primary test is therefore:\n$$H_0: \\Delta \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{versus} \\quad H_A: \\Delta  0$$\nThis is a one-sided (or one-tailed) test. A one-sided test is required because the decision rule is directional. The company is only interested in detecting a decrease in expression as evidence of efficacy. An increase in expression ($\\Delta > 0$) leads to the same \"no-go\" decision (for efficacy) as no change in expression ($\\Delta = 0$).\n\nFor completeness, a two-sided test would be appropriate if the question were whether the treatment has *any* effect, either increasing or decreasing expression. In that case, the hypotheses would be:\n$$H_0: \\Delta = 0 \\quad \\text{versus} \\quad H_A: \\Delta \\ne 0$$\nThis structure tests for any non-zero difference and is not aligned with the specified directional decision rule for efficacy.\n\nNow, I will evaluate each option.\n\nA. Use a one-sided alternative focused on downregulation for the primary test because only a decrease in expression is efficacy-relevant under the pre-registered decision rule. One-sided: $H_{0}\\!:\\,\\Delta \\ge 0$ versus $H_{A}\\!:\\,\\Delta  0$. Two-sided (for comparison): $H_{0}\\!:\\,\\Delta = 0$ versus $H_{A}\\!:\\,\\Delta \\ne 0$.\n- The choice of a one-sided test is correct.\n- The justification, based on the pre-registered decision rule and the definition of efficacy-relevant effect, is correct and rigorous.\n- The formulation of the one-sided hypothesis pair, $H_{0}\\!:\\,\\Delta \\ge 0$ versus $H_{A}\\!:\\,\\Delta  0$, is correct.\n- The formulation of the two-sided hypothesis pair for comparison is also the standard, correct form.\nThis option is entirely correct.\n\nB. Use a two-sided alternative for the primary test because two-sided tests maximize power at fixed $\\alpha$. One-sided (for comparison): $H_{0}\\!:\\,\\Delta \\ge 0$ versus $H_{A}\\!:\\,\\Delta  0$. Two-sided: $H_{0}\\!:\\,\\Delta = 0$ versus $H_{A}\\!:\\,\\Delta \\ne 0$.\n- The choice of a two-sided test is incorrect, as the decision rule is directional.\n- The justification that \"two-sided tests maximize power at fixed $\\alpha$\" is a false statement. For a given $\\alpha$, a one-sided test has greater statistical power to detect an effect in the specified direction than a two-sided test. A two-sided test splits the rejection region into two tails, thus requiring a larger effect size to achieve significance in any one direction.\nThis option is incorrect.\n\nC. Use a one-sided alternative for the primary test because the drug is expected to inhibit. One-sided: $H_{0}\\!:\\,\\Delta \\le 0$ versus $H_{A}\\!:\\,\\Delta > 0$. Two-sided: $H_{0}\\!:\\,\\Delta = 0$ versus $H_{A}\\!:\\,\\Delta \\ne 0$.\n- The choice of a one-sided test is correct, but the reason provided (\"because the drug is expected to inhibit\") is weaker than using the pre-specified decision rule. Hypotheses should be based on the question being asked, not on prior beliefs.\n- The formulation of the one-sided hypothesis, $H_{A}\\!:\\,\\Delta > 0$, is incorrect. This would test for a significant *increase* in oncogene expression, which contradicts the stated goal of the study. The company is looking for a *decrease*.\nThis option is incorrect.\n\nD. Use a two-sided alternative for the primary test because there are many genes in RNA-seq and multiple-testing corrections require two-sided tests. One-sided (for comparison): $H_{0}\\!:\\,\\Delta = 0$ versus $H_{A}\\!:\\,\\Delta  0$. Two-sided: $H_{0}\\!:\\,\\Delta = 0$ versus $H_{A}\\!:\\,\\Delta \\ne 0$.\n- The choice of a two-sided test is incorrect for the same reason as in B.\n- The justification that \"multiple-testing corrections require two-sided tests\" is false. Standard procedures for controlling the false discovery rate or family-wise error rate (e.g., Benjamini-Hochberg, Bonferroni) operate on p-values, regardless of whether they originate from one-sided or two-sided tests. Furthermore, the problem concerns the primary hypothesis for a single pre-specified oncogene, not a genome-wide screen, so multiple testing is not the central issue defining the hypothesis structure for this gene.\n- The formulation of the one-sided null hypothesis as $H_0: \\Delta = 0$ is a common simplification, but the composite null $H_0: \\Delta \\ge 0$ (as in option A) is more technically complete as it is the exact complement of the alternative $H_A: \\Delta  0$. While the test procedure is often identical, the formulation in A is more rigorous.\nThis option is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option A is the only one that correctly identifies the test type, provides the correct justification based on the stated decision rule, and formulates both the one-sided and two-sided hypotheses correctly.\n\nFinal Verdict: Option A is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2410281"}, {"introduction": "Perhaps the most common pitfall in applying statistics is misinterpreting a non-significant result.

The terms used (e.g., \"mean normalized expression\", \"two-sided test\", \"$p$-value\") have precise definitions in statistics and biology.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is a valid problem that can be solved using the principles of statistical hypothesis testing. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution and evaluation of the options.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the correct formulation and interpretation of a null hypothesis significance test (NHST). Let $\\mu_{\\text{KD}}$ represent the true population mean of normalized expression for the target gene in the knockdown condition, and let $\\mu_{\\text{CTRL}}$ represent the true population mean in the control condition. The goal is to test for a difference between these two population means.\n\nThe null hypothesis, $H_0$, is the hypothesis of \"no effect\" or \"no difference\". It posits that the knockdown has no effect on the mean expression level. Mathematically, this is expressed as the equality of the population means.\n$$H_0: \\mu_{\\text{KD}} = \\mu_{\\text{CTRL}}$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$H_0: \\mu_{\\text{KD}} - \\mu_{\\text{CTRL}} = 0$$\n\nThe alternative hypothesis, $H_A$, is the hypothesis that there is an effect. The problem specifies a \"two-sided test\", which means we are interested in detecting a difference in either direction (an increase or a decrease in expression). Mathematically, this is expressed as an inequality of the population means.\n$$H_A: \\mu_{\\text{KD}} \\neq \\mu_{\\text{CTRL}}$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$H_A: \\mu_{\\text{KD}} - \\mu_{\\text{CTRL}} \\neq 0$$\n\nThe test was conducted at a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$. This value, $\\alpha$, is the pre-defined threshold for the probability of a Type I error (incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis). The test yielded a $p$-value of $p=0.12$. The decision rule in NHST is to compare the $p$-value to $\\alpha$.\nSince $p = 0.12 > \\alpha = 0.05$, the result is not statistically significant. The correct conclusion from this is that we \"fail to reject the null hypothesis\".\n\nIt is a grave logical error to interpret \"failing to reject $H_0$\" as \"accepting $H_0$\" or \"proving $H_0$ is true\". The absence of evidence against $H_0$ is not evidence for the truth of $H_0$. This is particularly important in studies with low statistical power.\n\nStatistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis (i.e., detecting a true effect). It is equal to $1-\\beta$, where $\\beta$ is the probability of a Type II error (failing to reject a false null hypothesis). Power is positively correlated with sample size ($n$), effect size, and the significance level ($\\alpha$). In this experiment, the sample sizes are extremely small ($n_{\\text{KD}}=4$, $n_{\\text{CTRL}}=4$). Such small sample sizes result in very low statistical power. A low-powered study has a high probability ($\\beta$) of failing to detect a true effect, even if one exists.\n\nTherefore, the non-significant result ($p=0.12$) is inconclusive. It could mean that there is truly no effect (i.e., $H_0$ is true), or it could mean that there is a real effect, but the experiment was too underpowered to detect it (a Type II error). To conclude \"there is no effect\" is an overstatement that the data do not support.\n\nNow, I shall evaluate each option based on this framework.\n\nA. $H_0$: the difference in population mean expression is $0$; $H_A$: the difference in population mean expression is $\\neq 0$. Because $p=0.12>\\alpha=0.05$, the test fails to reject $H_0$. With small $n$, statistical power is low (higher probability of Type II error), so a non-significant result is not evidence that the true effect is exactly $0$.\n- **Hypotheses**: The hypotheses are correctly stated for a two-sided test on population means.\n- **Reasoning**: The comparison $p > \\alpha$ and the conclusion \"fails to reject $H_0$\" are correct. The explanation, linking small sample size ($n$) to low statistical power and a higher probability of Type II error, is the precise reason why one cannot conclude there is \"no effect\". This statement is entirely correct and provides the most accurate and complete explanation.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\nB. $H_0$: there is a true effect; $H_A$: there is no true effect. Because $p=0.12>\\alpha=0.05$, we accept $H_0$ and conclude there is no effect.\n- **Hypotheses**: The formulation of $H_0$ and $H_A$ is fundamentally reversed. The null hypothesis must be the statement of no effect.\n- **Reasoning**: The conclusion \"we accept $H_0$\" is a common but profound statistical error. Furthermore, accepting their incorrectly stated $H_0$ (\"there is a true effect\") would lead to the opposite conclusion of what they wrote (\"conclude there is no effect\"). This option is a cascade of errors.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. $H_0$: the sample means are equal; $H_A$: the sample means differ. Because the sample size is small, the Type I error rate is inflated, so we cannot trust the test and should assume there is no effect.\n- **Hypotheses**: The hypotheses are stated in terms of *sample* means, not *population* means. Hypothesis tests make inferences about populations, not describe samples. We can directly calculate and compare sample means; no test is needed for that.\n- **Reasoning**: The claim that small sample size inflates the Type I error rate is false. The Type I error rate is controlled by the chosen $\\alpha$, which is fixed at $0.05$. Small sample size increases the Type II error rate (reduces power), not the Type I error rate. The final assertion \"should assume there is no effect\" is an unsubstantiated leap.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. $H_0$: the difference in population medians is $0$; $H_A$: the difference in population medians is $0$. Given a prior expectation of up-regulation, a two-sided test proving non-significance implies no effect.\n- **Hypotheses**: The problem specifies a test of *means*, not *medians*. It also specifies a *two-sided* test ($\\neq$), while this option presents a *one-sided* test ($$).\n- **Reasoning**: The logic is flawed. A non-significant result from any test does not \"prove\" or \"imply\" no effect. The mention of a two-sided test is contradicted by the stated one-sided $H_A$.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. $H_0$: the difference in population mean expression is $0$; $H_A$: the difference in population mean expression is $\\neq 0$. Since $p=0.12$, there is a $12\\%$ chance the null hypothesis is true; this large probability indicates there is likely no effect.\n- **Hypotheses**: The hypotheses are stated correctly.\n- **Reasoning**: The interpretation of the $p$-value is fundamentally wrong. The $p$-value is $P(\\text{data as or more extreme} | H_0 \\text{ is true})$, not $P(H_0 \\text{ is true} | \\text{data})$. Asserting that the $p$-value is the probability of the null hypothesis being true is one of the most common and serious misinterpretations in statistics.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn summary, Option A is the only one that correctly formulates the hypotheses and provides an accurate, complete, and nuanced statistical explanation for why the conclusion \"there is no effect\" is invalid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2410288"}]}
