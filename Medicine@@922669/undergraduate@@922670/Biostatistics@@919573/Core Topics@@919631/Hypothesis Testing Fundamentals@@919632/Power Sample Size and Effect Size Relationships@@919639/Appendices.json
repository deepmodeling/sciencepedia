A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nLet $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ be the true population means of the biomarker for the two treatment arms. Let $\\bar{X}_1$ and $\\bar{X}_2$ be the sample means from samples of size $n$ drawn from each arm, respectively. The hypotheses for the two-sided test are:\n- Null hypothesis $H_0: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0$.\n- Alternative hypothesis $H_A: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 \\neq 0$.\n\n**1. Sampling Distribution of the Difference in Sample Means**\nGiven that the individual observations are drawn from normal distributions, $X_{1i} \\sim N(\\mu_1, \\sigma^2)$ and $X_{2j} \\sim N(\\mu_2, \\sigma^2)$, the sample means are also normally distributed: $\\bar{X}_1 \\sim N(\\mu_1, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n})$ and $\\bar{X}_2 \\sim N(\\mu_2, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n})$.\n\nSince the two arms are independent, the difference in sample means, $\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2$, is also normally distributed.\nThe mean of this difference is $E[\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2] = E[\\bar{X}_1] - E[\\bar{X}_2] = \\mu_1 - \\mu_2$.\nThe variance of this difference is $\\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2) = \\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_1) + \\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_2) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}$.\nThus, the sampling distribution of the difference in sample means is:\n$$ \\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2 \\sim N\\left(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2, \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}\\right) $$\n\n**2. Justification for Using the Standard Normal Distribution ($Z$-distribution)**\nThe problem states that the population standard deviation $\\sigma=12$ is known. When $\\sigma$ is known, the test statistic $Z = \\frac{(\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2) - (\\mu_1 - \\mu_2)}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/n}}$ follows the standard normal distribution, $N(0,1)$, exactly. The Student's $t$-distribution is only used when $\\sigma$ is unknown and must be estimated from the sample data. Since this is a planning-stage calculation, it is standard practice to use a value for $\\sigma$ from prior research, which is treated as known. Consequently, the use of quantiles from the standard normal distribution is appropriate.\n\n**3. Derivation of the Critical Value from the Type I Error Constraint**\nThe significance level $\\alpha$ is the probability of a Type I error, which is the probability of rejecting $H_0$ when it is true.\nUnder $H_0$, $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0$, so the sampling distribution is $\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2 \\sim N(0, \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n})$.\nFor a two-sided test, we reject $H_0$ if the observed difference is sufficiently far from $0$ in either direction, i.e., if $|\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2| > C$, where $C$ is the critical value.\nThe Type I error rate is given by:\n$$ P(|\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2| > C \\mid H_0) = \\alpha $$\nTo find $C$, we standardize the variable:\n$$ P\\left(\\frac{|\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2| - 0}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/n}} > \\frac{C}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/n}}\\right) = \\alpha $$\nLet $Z$ be a standard normal random variable. The expression is equivalent to $P(|Z| > \\frac{C}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/n}}) = \\alpha$.\nThe value from the standard normal distribution that leaves a tail probability of $\\alpha/2$ in each tail is denoted $z_{\\alpha/2}$. Thus, we must have:\n$$ \\frac{C}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/n}} = z_{\\alpha/2} $$\nSolving for the critical value $C$:\n$$ C = z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}} \\quad (*)$$\n\n**4. Derivation of Sample Size from the Power Constraint**\nPower ($1-\\beta$) is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when the alternative hypothesis $H_A$ is true. We evaluate power for the specific alternative where the true mean difference is $|\\mu_1 - \\mu_2| = \\Delta$. Without loss of generality, let's assume $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = \\Delta > 0$.\nUnder this alternative, the sampling distribution is $\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2 \\sim N(\\Delta, \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n})$.\nPower is given by:\n$$ 1 - \\beta = P(|\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2| > C \\mid \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = \\Delta) $$\nThis expands to:\n$$ 1 - \\beta = P(\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2 > C) + P(\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2  -C) $$\nWe standardize the random variable $\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2$ under the alternative hypothesis:\n$$ Z = \\frac{(\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2) - \\Delta}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/n}} \\sim N(0,1) $$\nThe probability becomes:\n$$ 1 - \\beta = P\\left(Z > \\frac{C - \\Delta}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/n}}\\right) + P\\left(Z  \\frac{-C - \\Delta}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/n}}\\right) $$\nFor a well-designed study, the power is high, meaning the distribution under $H_A$ is well-separated from the rejection region in the opposite tail. The second term, $P(Z  \\frac{-C-\\Delta}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/n}})$, corresponds to rejecting in the \"wrong\" tail and is typically negligible. For instance, if power is $0.9$, the first term will be close to $0.9$, making the second term extremely small. We can therefore approximate the power by the first term:\n$$ 1 - \\beta \\approx P\\left(Z > \\frac{C - \\Delta}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/n}}\\right) $$\nThe standard normal quantile $z_{\\beta}$ is defined by $P(Z > z_{\\beta}) = \\beta$, which is equivalent to $P(Z \\le z_{\\beta}) = 1-\\beta$, or $P(Z > -z_{\\beta}) = 1-\\beta$. Thus, we set:\n$$ \\frac{C - \\Delta}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/n}} = -z_{\\beta} $$\nSolving for $C$:\n$$ C = \\Delta - z_{\\beta} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}} \\quad (**) $$\n\n**5. Solving for the Sample Size $n$**\nWe now have two expressions for the critical value $C$ from equations $(*)$ and $(**)$. Equating them gives:\n$$ z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}} = \\Delta - z_{\\beta} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}} $$\nRearranging to solve for $n$:\n$$ \\Delta = z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}} + z_{\\beta} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}} $$\n$$ \\Delta = (z_{\\alpha/2} + z_{\\beta}) \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}} $$\nSquaring both sides:\n$$ \\Delta^2 = (z_{\\alpha/2} + z_{\\beta})^2 \\left(\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}\\right) $$\nFinally, isolating $n$:\n$$ n = \\frac{2\\sigma^2(z_{\\alpha/2} + z_{\\beta})^2}{\\Delta^2} $$\n\n**6. Numerical Calculation**\nWe are given the following values:\n- $\\sigma = 12$\n- $\\Delta = 5$\n- $\\alpha = 0.05 \\implies \\alpha/2 = 0.025$\n- $1-\\beta = 0.9 \\implies \\beta = 0.1$\n\nWe need the corresponding quantiles from the standard normal distribution:\n- $z_{\\alpha/2} = z_{0.025}$. This is the value such that $P(Z > z_{0.025}) = 0.025$. From standard tables or a calculator, $z_{0.025} \\approx 1.95996$.\n- $z_{\\beta} = z_{0.1}$. This is the value such that $P(Z > z_{0.1}) = 0.1$. From standard tables or a calculator, $z_{0.1} \\approx 1.28155$.\n\nNow, substitute these values into the derived formula for $n$:\n$$ n = \\frac{2(12)^2(1.95996 + 1.28155)^2}{5^2} $$\n$$ n = \\frac{2(144)(3.24151)^2}{25} $$\n$$ n = \\frac{288(10.50737...)}{25} $$\n$$ n = \\frac{3026.122...}{25} $$\n$$ n = 121.044... $$\nSince the sample size $n$ must be an integer, and the calculated value is the minimum required to achieve the exact target power, we must round up to the next whole number to ensure that the power is *at least* $0.9$. Therefore, the minimal required sample size per arm is $122$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{122}$$", "id": "4939344"}, {"introduction": "While the assumption of equal variances simplifies calculations, many real-world scenarios involve comparing groups with different underlying variability.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Planning Equation\nLet $\\bar{X}_1$ and $\\bar{X}_2$ be the sample means from two independent groups of sizes $n_1$ and $n_2$, respectively. We assume the underlying data are normally distributed, $X_1 \\sim N(\\mu_1, \\sigma_1^2)$ and $X_2 \\sim N(\\mu_2, \\sigma_2^2)$. The sampling distribution of the difference in sample means, $\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2$, is also normal:\n$$ (\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2) \\sim N\\left(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2, \\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}\\right) $$\nThe null hypothesis is $H_0: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0$, and the two-sided alternative hypothesis is $H_A: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = \\Delta \\neq 0$.\n\nThe test statistic for the Welch's t-test is $T = \\frac{\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2}{\\sqrt{S_1^2/n_1 + S_2^2/n_2}}$, where $S_1^2$ and $S_2^2$ are the sample variances. For planning purposes, where sample sizes are typically large enough, we can make two key approximations:\n1.  The sample variances are replaced by their population planning values: $S_1^2 \\approx \\sigma_1^2$ and $S_2^2 \\approx \\sigma_2^2$.\n2.  The t-distribution for the test statistic is approximated by the standard normal distribution, which is reasonable for degrees of freedom greater than approximately $30$.\n\nUnder these approximations, the test statistic under $H_0$ is $Z_{\\text{test}} = \\frac{\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2/n_1 + \\sigma_2^2/n_2}}$. For a two-sided test with significance level $\\alpha$, we reject $H_0$ if $|Z_{\\text{test}}| > z_{\\alpha/2}$, where $z_{\\alpha/2}$ is the upper $\\alpha/2$ quantile of the standard normal distribution.\n\nPower is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when $H_A$ is true. Let $\\text{SE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}$ be the standard error of the difference in means.\n$$ \\text{Power} = 1 - \\beta = P\\left(|\\frac{\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2}{\\text{SE}}| > z_{\\alpha/2} \\;\\middle|\\; H_A\\right) $$\nThis can be written as the sum of probabilities for the two rejection regions:\n$$ 1 - \\beta = P\\left(\\frac{\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2}{\\text{SE}} > z_{\\alpha/2} \\;\\middle|\\; H_A\\right) + P\\left(\\frac{\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2}{\\text{SE}}  -z_{\\alpha/2} \\;\\middle|\\; H_A\\right) $$\nUnder $H_A$, the random variable $(\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2)$ has a mean of $\\Delta$. To evaluate the probabilities, we standardize with respect to the true mean $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\frac{(\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2) - \\Delta}{\\text{SE}} \\sim N(0, 1) $$\nSubstituting this into the power equation:\n$$ 1 - \\beta = P\\left(Z > z_{\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\text{SE}}\\right) + P\\left(Z  -z_{\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\text{SE}}\\right) $$\nwhere $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$. For a positive effect size $\\Delta > 0$ and typical values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, the second term $P(Z  -z_{\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\text{SE}})$ is negligible because its argument is a large negative number. Thus, we can approximate the power by considering only the first term:\n$$ 1 - \\beta \\approx P\\left(Z > z_{\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\text{SE}}\\right) $$\nWe also know that for a standard normal variable $Z$, the probability $P(Z > -z_\\beta) = 1-\\beta$, where $z_\\beta$ is the upper $\\beta$ quantile. By equating the arguments, we get:\n$$ -z_\\beta = z_{\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\text{SE}} $$\nRearranging for $\\Delta$ (and using $|\\Delta|$ for generality) yields the planning equation:\n$$ |\\Delta| = (z_{\\alpha/2} + z_\\beta) \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}} $$\nThis equation links the effect size $\\Delta$, power ($1-\\beta$), significance level $\\alpha$, variances $\\sigma_1^2, \\sigma_2^2$, and sample sizes $n_1, n_2$.\n\n### Calculation of Sample Sizes\nWe use the derived planning equation to solve for $n_1$ and $n_2$. First, substitute the allocation ratio $n_2 = r n_1 = 2 n_1$:\n$$ |\\Delta| = (z_{\\alpha/2} + z_\\beta) \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{r n_1}} $$\n$$ |\\Delta|^2 = (z_{\\alpha/2} + z_\\beta)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{n_1}\\left(\\sigma_1^2 + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{r}\\right)\\right) $$\nSolving for $n_1$:\n$$ n_1 = \\frac{(z_{\\alpha/2} + z_\\beta)^2}{|\\Delta|^2} \\left(\\sigma_1^2 + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{r}\\right) $$\nWe are given:\n- $\\alpha = 0.05 \\implies z_{\\alpha/2} = z_{0.025} = 1.9600$.\n- $1 - \\beta = 0.80 \\implies \\beta = 0.20 \\implies z_\\beta = z_{0.20} \\approx 0.8416$.\n- $|\\Delta| = 0.5$.\n- $\\sigma_1^2 = 1$ and $\\sigma_2^2 = 4$.\n- $r = 2$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for $n_1$:\n$$ n_1 = \\frac{(1.9600 + 0.8416)^2}{(0.5)^2} \\left(1 + \\frac{4}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ n_1 = \\frac{(2.8016)^2}{0.25} (1 + 2) $$\n$$ n_1 = \\frac{7.84896256}{0.25} \\times 3 $$\n$$ n_1 = 31.39585 \\times 3 = 94.18755 $$\nSince sample sizes must be integers, we round up to the next whole number to ensure the power is at least $0.80$:\n$$ n_1 = 95 $$\nNow we find $n_2$:\n$$ n_2 = r \\times n_1 = 2 \\times 95 = 190 $$\nThe required sample sizes are $n_1 = 95$ and $n_2 = 190$. The total sample size is $N = n_1 + n_2 = 95 + 190 = 285$.\n\n### Quantitative Comment on Efficiency\nTo assess the efficiency of the $r=2$ allocation, we compare it to equal allocation ($r=1$) under the same conditions. We recalculate the required sample size with $r=1$:\n$$ n_1 = \\frac{(1.9600 + 0.8416)^2}{(0.5)^2} \\left(1 + \\frac{4}{1}\\right) $$\n$$ n_1 = \\frac{(2.8016)^2}{0.25} (1 + 4) $$\n$$ n_1 = 31.39585 \\times 5 = 156.97925 $$\nRounding up, we get $n_1 = 157$. For equal allocation, $n_2 = n_1 = 157$.\nThe total sample size for equal allocation is $N_{r=1} = 157 + 157 = 314$.\n\nThe allocation ratio that minimizes the total sample size $N = n_1 + n_2$ for a fixed variance of the mean difference is given by $r_{\\text{opt}} = \\frac{\\sigma_2}{\\sigma_1}$. In this problem, $\\sigma_1 = \\sqrt{1} = 1$ and $\\sigma_2 = \\sqrt{4} = 2$, so the optimal allocation ratio is $r_{\\text{opt}} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$.\nThe specified allocation ratio $r=2$ is, in fact, the optimal allocation for this variance structure.\n\nQuantitatively, the total sample size for the optimal allocation ($r=2$) is $N_{r=2} = 285$, whereas the total sample size for equal allocation ($r=1$) is $N_{r=1} = 314$. The efficiency of the optimal allocation relative to equal allocation can be expressed as the ratio of the total sample sizes:\n$$ \\text{Relative Efficiency} = \\frac{N_{r=1}}{N_{r=2}} = \\frac{314}{285} \\approx 1.1018 $$\nThis means that using the optimal allocation ($r=2$) requires approximately $10.2\\%$ fewer total subjects than using an equal allocation ($r=1$) to achieve the same statistical power. Alternatively, equal allocation requires $(314 - 285)/285 \\approx 0.1018$, or a $10.18\\%$ larger sample size, making it less efficient under these conditions of unequal variance.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n95  190\n\\end{pmatrix}\n} $$", "id": "4939258"}, {"introduction": "Study planning always involves uncertainty, and the initial estimates for parameters like standard deviation may not hold true once data collection begins.

The assumptions of normality, common variance, and the concepts of significance level ($\\alpha$), power ($1-\\beta$), and effect size ($\\Delta$) are standard in this context.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary parameters to derive the relationship between sample size ($n$) and standard deviation ($\\sigma$). It then gives a specific scenario ($n_0=50, \\sigma_0=10$) and a new parameter ($\\hat{\\sigma}=12$) to calculate an adjusted sample size ($n_1$). The objective is clear and a unique solution can be determined. The fact that the initial numbers ($n_0=50, \\sigma_0=10, \\Delta=4, \\alpha=0.05, 1-\\beta=0.80$) are not perfectly consistent with the standard formula does not invalidate the problem, as the question asks to use the derived *dependence* to scale the *given* initial sample size. This is a common practical task in sample size re-estimation.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet $\\bar{X}_T$ and $\\bar{X}_C$ be the sample means for the treatment and control arms, respectively, each based on a sample size of $n$. The outcomes are assumed to be drawn from normal distributions, $N(\\mu_T, \\sigma^2)$ and $N(\\mu_C, \\sigma^2)$. The sample means are therefore distributed as:\n$$ \\bar{X}_T \\sim N\\left(\\mu_T, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\right) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\bar{X}_C \\sim N\\left(\\mu_C, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\right) $$\nDue to the independence of the two arms, the distribution of the difference in sample means, $D = \\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C$, is also normal:\n$$ D \\sim N\\left(\\mu_T - \\mu_C, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\right) = N\\left(\\mu_T - \\mu_C, \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}\\right) $$\nThe null hypothesis is $H_0: \\mu_T - \\mu_C = 0$, and the alternative hypothesis is $H_1: \\mu_T - \\mu_C \\neq 0$. The test statistic, assuming $\\sigma$ is known, is the Z-statistic:\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C - 0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}}} $$\nUnder $H_0$, $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$. For a two-sided test with significance level $\\alpha$, we reject $H_0$ if $|Z| > z_{1-\\alpha/2}$, where $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the upper $(1-\\alpha/2)$ quantile of the standard normal distribution. This is equivalent to rejecting $H_0$ if $|\\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C| > z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}}$.\n\nPower is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when the alternative hypothesis is true. We evaluate power for a specific true difference $\\Delta = \\mu_T - \\mu_C$. Under this alternative, $D = \\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C \\sim N(\\Delta, \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n})$. The power, $1-\\beta$, is:\n$$ 1-\\beta = P\\left(|\\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C| > z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}} \\;\\middle|\\; \\mu_T - \\mu_C = \\Delta \\right) $$\nThis can be written as the sum of two probabilities:\n$$ 1-\\beta = P\\left(\\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C  z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}}\\right) + P\\left(\\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C  -z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}}\\right) $$\nTo evaluate these probabilities, we standardize the variable $\\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C$ under the alternative hypothesis. Let $Z' = \\frac{(\\bar{X}_T - \\bar{X}_C) - \\Delta}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/n}}$, where $Z' \\sim N(0, 1)$.\nThe inequalities become:\n$$ 1-\\beta = P\\left(Z'  \\frac{z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}} - \\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}}}\\right) + P\\left(Z'  \\frac{-z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}} - \\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}}}\\right) $$\n$$ 1-\\beta = P\\left(Z'  z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}}}\\right) + P\\left(Z'  -z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}}}\\right) $$\nAssuming $\\Delta > 0$ (as is the case here with $\\Delta = 4$), for typical power levels (e.g., $0.80$), the second term is negligible. Thus, the power is well-approximated by the first term:\n$$ 1-\\beta \\approx P\\left(Z'  z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}}}\\right) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}}}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}}} - z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\right) $$\nwhere $\\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.\nFrom this, we get:\n$$ z_{1-\\beta} = \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}}} - z_{1-\\alpha/2} $$\nSolving for $n$:\n$$ z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta} = \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma} \\sqrt{n} $$\n$$ \\sqrt{n} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma(z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})}{\\Delta} $$\n$$ n = \\frac{2\\sigma^2(z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2}{\\Delta^2} $$\nThis derived expression shows the relationship between the required per-arm sample size $n$ and the standard deviation $\\sigma$. Since all other parameters ($\\alpha, \\beta, \\Delta$) are held constant, we can write:\n$$ n = k \\cdot \\sigma^2 $$\nwhere $k = \\frac{2(z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2}{\\Delta^2}$ is a constant determined by the fixed design choices. This confirms that the required sample size is directly proportional to the variance, $\\sigma^2$.\n\n### Calculation of Adjusted Sample Size\nWe can use this proportionality to calculate the adjusted sample size $n_1$.\nLet $n_0$ be the sample size planned with standard deviation $\\sigma_0$, and $n_1$ be the sample size required for a standard deviation $\\sigma_1$.\nFrom the derived relationship:\n$$ n_0 = k \\sigma_0^2 $$\n$$ n_1 = k \\sigma_1^2 $$\nTaking the ratio of these two equations eliminates the constant $k$:\n$$ \\frac{n_1}{n_0} = \\frac{k \\sigma_1^2}{k \\sigma_0^2} = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\sigma_0}\\right)^2 $$\nWe can solve for $n_1$:\n$$ n_1 = n_0 \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\sigma_0}\\right)^2 $$\nThe problem provides the initial planning values: $n_0 = 50$ and $\\sigma_0 = 10$. The revised standard deviation is $\\sigma_1 = \\hat{\\sigma} = 12$. Substituting these values into the equation:\n$$ n_1 = 50 \\left(\\frac{12}{10}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ n_1 = 50 (1.2)^2 $$\n$$ n_1 = 50 (1.44) $$\n$$ n_1 = 72 $$\nThe adjusted per-arm sample size required to maintain the target power of $0.80$ with the revised standard deviation estimate of $12$ is $72$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{72}$$", "id": "4939349"}]}
