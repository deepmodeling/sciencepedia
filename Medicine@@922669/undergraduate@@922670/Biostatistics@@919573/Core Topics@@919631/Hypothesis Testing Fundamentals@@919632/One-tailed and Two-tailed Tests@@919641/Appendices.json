It contains no contradictions or missing information. The verdict is that the problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nA $p$-value is defined as the probability, under the null hypothesis ($H_0$), of obtaining a test statistic result at least as extreme as the one that was actually observed. The null hypothesis states that our test statistic, $Z$, follows a standard normal distribution, denoted as $Z \\sim N(0,1)$. The observed test statistic is given as $z_{\\text{obs}} = 2.1$.\n\n**1) Computation of the one-tailed $p$-value**\n\nThe one-tailed alternative hypothesis is the superiority claim, $H_1: \\mu_{\\text{new}}-\\mu_{\\text{standard}}  0$. The problem explicitly states that the test statistic has been coded such that \"positive $z_{\\text{obs}}$ indicates evidence for the prespecified superiority direction.\" This means that the region of rejection for this one-tailed test lies in the upper tail of the standard normal distribution. Values of the test statistic that are greater than or equal to the observed value $z_{\\text{obs}}$ are considered \"at least as extreme\" in the direction of the alternative hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the one-tailed $p$-value, which we denote as $p_{1}$, is the probability $P(Z \\ge z_{\\text{obs}})$ under the assumption that $H_0$ is true.\n$$p_{1} = P(Z \\ge 2.1 | H_0)$$\nLet $\\Phi(z)$ be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, defined as $\\Phi(z) = P(Z \\le z)$. The probability of being in the upper tail can be calculated as:\n$$p_{1} = 1 - P(Z  2.1) = 1 - \\Phi(2.1)$$\nUsing standard statistical tables or computational software for the standard normal CDF, we find that $\\Phi(2.1) \\approx 0.9821356$.\n$$p_{1} \\approx 1 - 0.9821356 = 0.0178644$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the one-tailed $p$-value is $0.01786$.\n\n**2) Computation of the two-tailed $p$-value**\n\nFor the two-tailed alternative hypothesis, $H_1: \\mu_{\\text{new}}-\\mu_{\\text{standard}} \\neq 0$, \"at least as extreme\" refers to observing a test statistic value as far from the null value ($0$) as $z_{\\text{obs}}$ is, but in either direction. This means we are interested in values of $Z$ such that $|Z| \\ge |z_{\\text{obs}}|$.\n\nThe two-tailed $p$-value, denoted as $p_{2}$, is:\n$$p_{2} = P(|Z| \\ge |2.1| | H_0) = P(Z \\ge 2.1 \\text{ or } Z \\le -2.1)$$\nSince the events $Z \\ge 2.1$ and $Z \\le -2.1$ are mutually exclusive, the probability of their union is the sum of their individual probabilities:\n$$p_{2} = P(Z \\ge 2.1) + P(Z \\le -2.1)$$\nDue to the symmetry of the standard normal distribution about $0$, we have $P(Z \\le -z) = P(Z \\ge z)$ for any $z  0$. Thus, $P(Z \\le -2.1) = P(Z \\ge 2.1)$.\nThis simplifies the expression for the two-tailed $p$-value to:\n$$p_{2} = 2 \\times P(Z \\ge 2.1) = 2 \\times p_{1}$$\nUsing the unrounded value for $p_1$:\n$$p_{2} \\approx 2 \\times 0.0178644 = 0.0357288$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the two-tailed $p$-value is $0.03573$.\n\n**Interpretation of Evidential Strength**\n\nThe interpretation of the evidence for the superiority claim must be based on the pre-specified one-tailed hypothesis and its corresponding $p$-value, $p_{1} \\approx 0.01786$. In hypothesis testing, we compare the $p$-value to a pre-determined significance level, denoted $\\alpha$. Conventional values for $\\alpha$ are $0.05$ and $0.01$.\n- If we use a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$, we find that $p_{1} \\approx 0.01786  0.05$. Under this convention, the result is statistically significant. We would reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ in favor of the alternative hypothesis $H_1$ that the new drug is superior.\n- If we use a more stringent significance level of $\\alpha = 0.01$, we find that $p_{1} \\approx 0.01786  0.01$. Under this convention, the result is not statistically significant. We would fail to reject the null hypothesis $H_0$.\n\nTherefore, the evidence for the new drug's superiority is statistically significant at the $\\alpha=0.05$ level, but not at the more rigorous $\\alpha=0.01$ level. This indicates moderate evidence against the null hypothesis in favor of the superiority claim. An interpretation from first principles is as follows: If the new drug truly had no effect compared to standard care ($H_0$ is true), the probability of observing a result at least as favorable to the new drug as the one obtained in this trial would be approximately $1.8\\%$. This is a rare event, suggesting the null hypothesis may not be true.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.01786  0.03573 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4934926"}, {"introduction": "The simple rule of doubling a one-tailed $p$-value, often used with continuous distributions like the normal distribution, requires careful reconsideration when dealing with discrete data.

This is a standard definition of an exact two-sided $p$-value, sometimes known as the \"small $p$\" method.\n\nFirst, we establish the probability of the observed outcome: $P(X=9) = \\frac{10}{1024}$.\nNext, we must find all possible outcomes $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 10\\}$ such that $P(X=k) \\leq P(X=9)$. This is equivalent to finding all $k$ such that:\n$$\\frac{\\binom{10}{k}}{1024} \\leq \\frac{10}{1024} \\implies \\binom{10}{k} \\leq 10$$\nLet's list the binomial coefficients $\\binom{10}{k}$:\n- $\\binom{10}{0} = 1$ (satisfies $\\leq 10$)\n- $\\binom{10}{1} = 10$ (satisfies $\\leq 10$)\n- $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$ (does not satisfy)\n- $\\binom{10}{3} = 120$ (does not satisfy)\n- $\\binom{10}{4} = 210$ (does not satisfy)\n- $\\binom{10}{5} = 252$ (does not satisfy)\nDue to the symmetry of the binomial coefficients, $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we have:\n- $\\binom{10}{6} = \\binom{10}{4} = 210$ (does not satisfy)\n- $\\binom{10}{7} = \\binom{10}{3} = 120$ (does not satisfy)\n- $\\binom{10}{8} = \\binom{10}{2} = 45$ (does not satisfy)\n- $\\binom{10}{9} = \\binom{10}{1} = 10$ (satisfies $\\leq 10$)\n- $\\binom{10}{10} = \\binom{10}{0} = 1$ (satisfies $\\leq 10$)\n\nThe set of outcomes as or more extreme (i.e., as or less probable) than $x=9$ is $\\{0, 1, 9, 10\\}$. The two-sided $p$-value is the sum of their probabilities:\n$$p_{\\text{two-sided}} = P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=9) + P(X=10)$$\n$$p_{\\text{two-sided}} = \\frac{\\binom{10}{0}}{1024} + \\frac{\\binom{10}{1}}{1024} + \\frac{\\binom{10}{9}}{1024} + \\frac{\\binom{10}{10}}{1024}$$\n$$p_{\\text{two-sided}} = \\frac{1 + 10 + 10 + 1}{1024} = \\frac{22}{1024} = \\frac{11}{512}$$\n\n**Part 3: Explanation of the \"Double the Tail\" Rule**\nThe \"double the smaller one-sided tail\" rule is a common heuristic for approximating a two-sided $p$-value. For the observed outcome $x=9$, the one-sided tail is $P(X \\ge 9) = \\frac{11}{1024}$. Doubling this value gives $2 \\times \\frac{11}{1024} = \\frac{22}{1024} = \\frac{11}{512}$. In this specific case, the result coincides with the exact two-sided $p$-value calculated above.\n\nThis coincidence, however, is an artifact of the symmetry of the null distribution, $X \\sim \\mathrm{Bin}(10, p=0.5)$. The fundamental principle for constructing a two-sided $p$-value is to sum the probabilities of all outcomes that are as probable as or less probable than the observed outcome. For a symmetric discrete distribution, an outcome $k$ in one tail and its counterpart $n-k$ in the other tail have the same probability, i.e., $P(X=k) = P(X=n-k)$. In our case, $P(X=9)=P(X=1)$ and $P(X=10)=P(X=0)$. The set of outcomes $\\{k | P(X=k) \\le P(X=9)\\}$ is $\\{0, 1, 9, 10\\}$. The total probability is $P(X \\le 1) + P(X \\ge 9)$, and due to symmetry, $P(X \\le 1) = P(X \\ge 9)$, so the total is indeed $2 \\times P(X \\ge 9)$.\n\nThis rule fails for asymmetric discrete distributions, which are common in medical studies (e.g., when the null probability is not $0.5$, or when using distributions like the Poisson). In an asymmetric distribution, two outcomes, one in each tail, will generally not have identical probabilities. For an observed outcome $x_{obs}$, the \"double the tail\" rule lacks a rigorous justification because \"equally extreme\" must be defined by probability, not by distance from the mean or any other measure of centrality. It is possible for an outcome $k_1$ in the lower tail to be less probable than an outcome $k_2$ in the upper tail, i.e., $P(X=k_1)  P(X=k_2)$, even if $k_2$ is \"further\" from the mean. The correct procedure is always to identify all outcomes $k$ for which $P(X=k) \\le P(X=x_{obs})$ and sum their probabilities. The \"double the tail\" shortcut ignores this principle and is therefore not generally valid for discrete distributions, producing an incorrect $p$-value whenever the null distribution is not symmetric.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{11}{1024}  \\frac{11}{512} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4821185"}, {"introduction": "Knowing how to calculate a $p$-value is only half the battle; knowing when to use a one-tailed versus a two-tailed test is a question of scientific and ethical integrity.

Therefore, when the observed effect is positive and the null distribution is symmetric and continuous, the two-sided $p$-value is exactly $2$ times the one-sided $p$-value for the “greater than” alternative that matches the observed sign. Hence, a reported two-sided value $p_{2}=0.08$ corresponds to a one-sided value $p_{+}=0.04$.\n\nHowever, the appropriateness of using a one-sided test depends on prespecifying the direction before examining the data. If the analysis plan required two-sided tests (because both up- and down-regulation were plausible), switching post hoc to a one-sided alternative after seeing that $t_{\\text{obs}}  0$ reduces the threshold for declaring significance and thereby increases the probability of a false positive compared to the intended two-sided procedure.

This statement restates the mathematical relationship derived above under the conditions of a continuous, symmetric null distribution and a one-sided alternative aligned with the observed sign. It correctly explains how $p=0.08$ (two-sided) can become $p=0.04$ (one-sided). Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. This claims that the halving is valid regardless of prespecification. While the numerical halving can still be computed, its validity as an inferential procedure depends critically on prespecifying the one-sided direction. Choosing the direction after viewing the data changes the testing procedure and inflates the Type I error relative to the planned two-sided test. Thus, as an inferential claim of validity, this is false. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. Bonferroni correction adjusts for multiple comparisons by multiplying unadjusted $p$-values by the number of tests to control the familywise error rate; it does not halve $p$-values. In fact, if one were to treat the two directional hypotheses as separate tests, Bonferroni would make inference more conservative, not less. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. This correctly identifies that selecting the one-sided alternative post hoc to match the observed sign reduces the stringency relative to the preregistered two-sided test, thereby increasing the probability of a false positive compared with the intended procedure. This misuse can explain why a retraction occurred, even though the numerical halving under symmetry is possible. Verdict: Correct.\n\nE. The halving arises from symmetry of the null distribution, not skewness. Under symmetry (and continuity), the two-sided $p$-value is $2$ times the one-sided $p$-value when the sign matches; skewness would generally break this exact factor-of-$2$ relationship.
