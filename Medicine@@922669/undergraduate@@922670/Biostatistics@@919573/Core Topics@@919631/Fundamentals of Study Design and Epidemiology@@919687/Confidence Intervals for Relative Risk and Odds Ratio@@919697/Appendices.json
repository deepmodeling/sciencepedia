We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe data can be summarized in a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table, where rows represent exposure status and columns represent the outcome. Let $a$ be the number of exposed individuals with the outcome, $b$ be the number of exposed individuals without the outcome, $c$ be the number of unexposed individuals with the outcome, and $d$ be the number of unexposed individuals without the outcome.\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n- Exposed group with outcome: $a = 300$\n- Exposed group without outcome: $b = 100$\n- Unexposed group with outcome: $c = 200$\n- Unexposed group without outcome: $d = 200$\n\nThe total number of participants in the exposed group is $n_1 = a+b = 300+100 = 400$.\nThe total number of participants in the unexposed group is $n_0 = c+d = 200+200 = 400$.\n\n**Sample Estimates of Relative Risk (RR) and Odds Ratio (OR)**\n\nThe risk in the exposed group is the proportion of individuals who develop the outcome: $R_1 = \\frac{a}{a+b}$. The sample estimate is $\\hat{R}_1 = \\frac{300}{400} = 0.75$.\nThe risk in the unexposed group is $R_0 = \\frac{c}{c+d}$. The sample estimate is $\\hat{R}_0 = \\frac{200}{400} = 0.50$.\n\nThe relative risk (RR) is the ratio of the risks: $RR = \\frac{R_1}{R_0}$.\nThe sample estimate is $\\widehat{RR} = \\frac{\\hat{R}_1}{\\hat{R}_0} = \\frac{0.75}{0.50} = 1.5$.\n\nThe odds of the outcome in the exposed group are $O_1 = \\frac{R_1}{1-R_1} = \\frac{a/(a+b)}{b/(a+b)} = \\frac{a}{b}$. The sample estimate is $\\hat{O}_1 = \\frac{300}{100} = 3$.\nThe odds of the outcome in the unexposed group are $O_0 = \\frac{R_0}{1-R_0} = \\frac{c/(c+d)}{d/(c+d)} = \\frac{c}{d}$. The sample estimate is $\\hat{O}_0 = \\frac{200}{200} = 1$.\n\nThe odds ratio (OR) is the ratio of the odds: $OR = \\frac{O_1}{O_0} = \\frac{a/b}{c/d} = \\frac{ad}{bc}$.\nThe sample estimate is $\\widehat{OR} = \\frac{300 \\times 200}{100 \\times 200} = \\frac{60000}{20000} = 3$.\n\n**Confidence Interval for Relative Risk (RR)**\n\nTo construct the confidence interval for the RR, we work on the logarithmic scale. The statistic of interest is $\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) = \\ln(\\hat{R}_1) - \\ln(\\hat{R}_0)$. Since the exposed and unexposed groups are independent, the variance of the difference is the sum of the variances:\n$Var(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = Var(\\ln(\\hat{R}_1)) + Var(\\ln(\\hat{R}_0))$.\n\nWe use the Delta Method to approximate the variance of $\\ln(\\hat{R})$. For a function $g(X)$, the Delta Method approximates the variance as $Var(g(X)) \\approx [g'(E[X])]^2 Var(X)$.\nHere, $\\hat{R}_1 = a/n_1$ is a sample proportion. The number of events $a$ is binomially distributed, $a \\sim Bin(n_1, R_1)$. Thus, $E[\\hat{R}_1] = R_1$ and $Var(\\hat{R}_1) = \\frac{R_1(1-R_1)}{n_1}$.\nLet $g(R_1) = \\ln(R_1)$. The derivative is $g'(R_1) = 1/R_1$.\nApplying the Delta Method:\n$$Var(\\ln(\\hat{R}_1)) \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{R_1}\\right)^2 Var(\\hat{R}_1) = \\frac{1}{R_1^2} \\frac{R_1(1-R_1)}{n_1} = \\frac{1-R_1}{n_1 R_1}$$\nThe estimated variance is found by substituting the sample estimates:\n$$\\widehat{Var}(\\ln(\\hat{R}_1)) = \\frac{1-\\hat{R}_1}{n_1 \\hat{R}_1} = \\frac{1-a/n_1}{n_1 (a/n_1)} = \\frac{(n_1-a)/n_1}{a} = \\frac{b/n_1}{a} = \\frac{b}{an_1}$$\nSimilarly, for the unexposed group, $\\widehat{Var}(\\ln(\\hat{R}_0)) = \\frac{d}{cn_0}$.\n\nThe estimated variance of the log-relative risk is:\n$$\\widehat{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\frac{b}{an_1} + \\frac{d}{cn_0} = \\frac{100}{300 \\times 400} + \\frac{200}{200 \\times 400} = \\frac{1}{1200} + \\frac{1}{400} = \\frac{1+3}{1200} = \\frac{4}{1200} = \\frac{1}{300}$$\nThe standard error (SE) is $SE(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{300}} \\approx 0.05774$.\nThe point estimate for the log-relative risk is $\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) = \\ln(1.5) \\approx 0.4055$.\nFor a $95\\%$ confidence interval, the critical value from the standard normal distribution is $z_{0.975} \\approx 1.96$.\nThe $95\\%$ CI for $\\ln(RR)$ is $\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) \\pm z_{0.975} \\times SE(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}))$.\n$$0.4055 \\pm 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{300}} \\approx 0.4055 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.05774 \\approx 0.4055 \\pm 0.1132$$\nThe interval for $\\ln(RR)$ is $[0.2923, 0.5187]$.\nTo obtain the CI for RR, we back-transform by exponentiating the limits:\n$$CI_{95\\%}(RR) = [\\exp(0.2923), \\exp(0.5187)] \\approx [1.340, 1.680]$$\n\n**Confidence Interval for Odds Ratio (OR)**\n\nSimilarly, we work on the logarithmic scale for the OR. We have $\\ln(OR) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{R_1/(1-R_1)}{R_0/(1-R_0)}\\right) = \\text{logit}(R_1) - \\text{logit}(R_0)$.\nThe variance is $Var(\\ln(\\widehat{OR})) = Var(\\text{logit}(\\hat{R}_1)) + Var(\\text{logit}(\\hat{R}_0))$.\nLet $h(R) = \\text{logit}(R) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{1-R}\\right)$. The derivative is $h'(R) = \\frac{1}{R(1-R)}$.\nUsing the Delta Method:\n$$Var(\\text{logit}(\\hat{R}_1)) \\approx [h'(R_1)]^2 Var(\\hat{R}_1) = \\left(\\frac{1}{R_1(1-R_1)}\\right)^2 \\frac{R_1(1-R_1)}{n_1} = \\frac{1}{n_1 R_1 (1-R_1)}$$\nThe estimated variance is:\n$$\\widehat{Var}(\\text{logit}(\\hat{R}_1)) = \\frac{1}{n_1 \\hat{R}_1 (1-\\hat{R}_1)} = \\frac{1}{n_1 (a/n_1) (b/n_1)} = \\frac{n_1}{ab}$$\nThis can be simplified: $\\frac{n_1}{ab} = \\frac{a+b}{ab} = \\frac{a}{ab} + \\frac{b}{ab} = \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{a}$.\nSo, the total estimated variance for the log-odds ratio is:\n$$\\widehat{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{OR})) = \\left(\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{c}+\\frac{1}{d}\\right) = \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{d}$$\nUsing the given data:\n$$\\widehat{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{OR})) = \\frac{1}{300} + \\frac{1}{100} + \\frac{1}{200} + \\frac{1}{200} = \\frac{2}{600} + \\frac{6}{600} + \\frac{3}{600} + \\frac{3}{600} = \\frac{14}{600} = \\frac{7}{300}$$\nThe standard error is $SE(\\ln(\\widehat{OR})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{300}} \\approx 0.1528$.\nThe point estimate for the log-odds ratio is $\\ln(\\widehat{OR}) = \\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$.\nThe $95\\%$ CI for $\\ln(OR)$ is:\n$$1.0986 \\pm 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{300}} \\approx 1.0986 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.1528 \\approx 1.0986 \\pm 0.2995$$\nThe interval for $\\ln(OR)$ is $[0.7991, 1.3981]$.\nBack-transforming to get the CI for OR:\n$$CI_{95\\%}(OR) = [\\exp(0.7991), \\exp(1.3981)] \\approx [2.224, 4.047]$$\n\n**Explanation of the Difference between RR and OR**\n\nThe relative risk (RR) is a ratio of probabilities (risks), while the odds ratio (OR) is a ratio of odds. The relationship between them is given by:\n$$OR = \\frac{R_1/(1-R_1)}{R_0/(1-R_0)} = \\frac{R_1}{R_0} \\times \\frac{1-R_0}{1-R_1} = RR \\times \\frac{1-R_0}{1-R_1}$$\nThe term $\\frac{1-R_0}{1-R_1}$ is the correction factor that relates OR to RR.\nWhen the baseline risk $R_0$ is low, and the risk in the exposed group $R_1$ is also low (rare disease assumption), both $1-R_0$ and $1-R_1$ are close to $1$. In this case, the correction factor is approximately $1$, and $OR \\approx RR$.\nIn a high-baseline-risk setting, as given here where $\\hat{R}_0=0.50$, the probabilities of not developing the outcome, $1-R_0$ and $1-R_1$, become important. If the exposure increases risk ($R_1  R_0$), then $1-R_1  1-R_0$. This makes the ratio $\\frac{1-R_0}{1-R_1}$ greater than $1$, causing the OR to be larger than the RR. The magnitude of this divergence increases as the risks $R_0$ and $R_1$ increase and move away from $0$.\nIn this problem, $\\hat{R}_0 = 0.50$ and $\\hat{R}_1 = 0.75$. The estimated correction factor is $\\frac{1-0.50}{1-0.75} = \\frac{0.50}{0.25} = 2$.\nThis multiplicative factor of $2$ explains why the odds ratio ($\\widehat{OR}=3$) is exactly twice the relative risk ($\\widehat{RR}=1.5$). The odds ratio reflects not only the increase in risk but also the corresponding *decrease* in non-risk, a multiplicative effect which becomes more pronounced as risk approaches $1$.\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\nThe ratio $\\text{OR}/\\text{RR}$ is computed from the sample estimates:\n$$\\frac{\\widehat{OR}}{\\widehat{RR}} = \\frac{3}{1.5} = 2$$\nRounded to four significant figures, this is $2.000$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.000}$$", "id": "4904678"}, {"introduction": "Standard statistical methods should be consistent, providing the same essential conclusion regardless of arbitrary choices in analysis, such as which group is defined as the reference.

It is well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The data are consistent ($a+b=n_{1}$, $c+d=n_{0}$) and the sample sizes are large enough to justify the use of large-sample approximations. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Variance of $\\log(RR)$\nThe relative risk is estimated by $\\widehat{RR} = \\hat{p}_{1}/\\hat{p}_{0}$, where $\\hat{p}_{1} = a/n_{1}$ and $\\hat{p}_{0} = c/n_{0}$ are the sample proportions. For constructing confidence intervals, it is standard practice to use a logarithmic transformation, $g(p_{1}, p_{0}) = \\ln(RR) = \\ln(p_{1}) - \\ln(p_{0})$. This transformation helps to normalize the sampling distribution and stabilize the variance.\n\nWe use the Delta Method to find the variance of $\\ln(\\widehat{RR})$. For a function $g(p_{1}, p_{0})$ of two independent random variables $\\hat{p}_{1}$ and $\\hat{p}_{0}$, the variance is approximated by:\n$$ \\text{Var}(g(\\hat{p}_{1}, \\hat{p}_{0})) \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p_{1}}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(\\hat{p}_{1}) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p_{0}}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(\\hat{p}_{0}) $$\nThe partial derivatives of $g(p_{1}, p_{0})$ are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p_{1}} = \\frac{1}{p_{1}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p_{0}} = -\\frac{1}{p_{0}} $$\nThe counts of cases, $a$ and $c$, are assumed to follow binomial distributions, $a \\sim \\text{Bin}(n_{1}, p_{1})$ and $c \\sim \\text{Bin}(n_{0}, p_{0})$.

The confidence interval for $\\ln(RR)$ is $[\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) - M, \\ln(\\widehat{RR}) + M]$.\nTo obtain the confidence interval for $RR$, we exponentiate the endpoints:\n$$ [L_{RR}, U_{RR}] = [\\exp(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) - M), \\exp(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) + M)] $$\nThe upper endpoint is $U_{RR} = \\exp(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) + M)$.\n\nNow we consider the reciprocal measure, $RR^{-1} = p_{0}/p_{1}$. The estimator is $\\widehat{RR}^{-1} = \\hat{p}_{0}/\\hat{p}_{1}$.\nOn the log scale, we have $\\ln(\\widehat{RR}^{-1}) = \\ln(\\hat{p}_{0}/\\hat{p}_{1}) = -\\ln(\\hat{p}_{1}/\\hat{p}_{0}) = -\\ln(\\widehat{RR})$.\nThe variance is:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}^{-1})) = \\text{Var}(-\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = (-1)^2 \\text{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\text{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) $$\nThus, the standard error is identical, and the margin of error $M$ is the same. The $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for $\\ln(RR^{-1})$ is:\n$$ \\ln(\\widehat{RR}^{-1}) \\pm M = -\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) \\pm M = [-\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) - M, -\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) + M] $$\nExponentiating these endpoints gives the confidence interval for $RR^{-1}$:\n$$ [L_{RR^{-1}}, U_{RR^{-1}}] = [\\exp(-\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) - M), \\exp(-\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) + M)] $$\nThe lower endpoint is $L_{RR^{-1}} = \\exp(-\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) - M)$.\n\nThis method ensures invariance under reciprocation. Let's verify this. The reciprocal of the upper limit for $RR$ is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{U_{RR}} = \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) + M)} = \\exp(-(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) + M)) = \\exp(-\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) - M) = L_{RR^{-1}} $$\nSimilarly, the reciprocal of the lower limit for $RR$ is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{L_{RR}} = \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) - M)} = \\exp(-(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) - M)) = \\exp(-\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) + M) = U_{RR^{-1}} $$\nThus, the confidence interval for $RR^{-1}$ is exactly $[1/U_{RR}, 1/L_{RR}]$. The procedure is invariant under reciprocation.\n\n### Step 4: Calculation of the Ratio $R$\nThe final task is to compute the ratio $R = \\frac{U_{RR}}{1/L_{RR^{-1}}}$.\nFrom the invariance property derived in the previous step, we have the exact relationship $L_{RR^{-1}} = 1/U_{RR}$.\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides gives $1/L_{RR^{-1}} = U_{RR}$.\nSubstituting this result into the expression for $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{U_{RR}}{U_{RR}} = 1 $$\nThis is an exact analytical result stemming from the symmetry of the confidence interval construction on the logarithmic scale. Any numerical calculation based on the problem's data must yield this value, up to floating-point rounding error.\n\nFor completeness, we can perform the numerical calculation:\n- $\\hat{p}_{1} = 48/600 = 0.08$.\n- $\\hat{p}_{0} = 30/800 = 0.0375$.\n- $\\widehat{RR} = 0.08 / 0.0375 = 32/15 \\approx 2.1333$.\n- $\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) = \\ln(32/15) \\approx 0.75778$.\n- $\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = (\\frac{1}{48} - \\frac{1}{600}) + (\\frac{1}{30} - \\frac{1}{800}) = 0.05125$.\n- $SE(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\sqrt{0.05125} \\approx 0.22638$.\n- $M = 1.96 \\times 0.22638 \\approx 0.44371$.\n- Upper limit for $\\ln(RR)$: $0.75778 + 0.44371 = 1.20149$.\n- $U_{RR} = \\exp(1.20149) \\approx 3.3251$.\n- Lower limit for $\\ln(RR^{-1})$: $-\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) - M = -0.75778 - 0.44371 = -1.20149$.\n- $L_{RR^{-1}} = \\exp(-1.20149) \\approx 0.30079$.\n- $1/L_{RR^{-1}} = 1/0.30079 \\approx 3.3246$.\n- $R = \\frac{3.3251}{3.3246} \\approx 1.00015$.\n\nRounding this numerical result to four significant figures gives $1.000$. The analytical result is exactly $1$.

The defining equations are:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=x}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} p_L^k (1-p_L)^{n-k} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{x} \\binom{n}{k} p_U^k (1-p_U)^{n-k} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\n$$\nSpecial cases exist for $x=0$ and $x=n$.\nFor this problem, the confidence level is $95\\%$, so $1-\\alpha = 0.95$, which implies $\\alpha=0.05$ and $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$.\n\nThe given data are:\nFor the treated cohort: sample size $n_1 = 10$, number of infections $x_1 = 0$.\nFor the untreated cohort: sample size $n_0 = 1$, number of infections $x_0 = 1$.\n\nWe will now calculate the $95\\%$ CI for $p_1$ and $p_0$.\n\n**Confidence Interval for the Treated Cohort Proportion, $p_1$**\nWe have $n_1=10$ and $x_1=0$.\nThe lower bound, $p_{1,L}$, for an observed count of $x_1=0$ is conventionally set to $0$. The defining equation for $p_L$ would be $\\sum_{k=0}^{10} \\binom{10}{k} p_L^k (1-p_L)^{10-k} = 1 = \\alpha/2$, which has no solution for $p_L \\in [0,1]$. Thus, by convention, $p_{1,L} = 0$.\n\nThe upper bound, $p_{1,U}$, is found by solving the equation for $x_1=0$:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{0} \\binom{10}{k} p_{1,U}^k (1-p_{1,U})^{10-k} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\binom{10}{0} p_{1,U}^0 (1-p_{1,U})^{10} = 0.025\n$$\n$$\n(1 - p_{1,U})^{10} = 0.025\n$$\nSolving for $p_{1,U}$:\n$$\n1 - p_{1,U} = (0.025)^{1/10}\n$$\n$$\np_{1,U} = 1 - (0.025)^{1/10}\n$$\nThe $95\\%$ CI for $p_1$ is $[p_{1,L}, p_{1,U}] = [0, 1 - (0.025)^{1/10}]$.\n\n**Confidence Interval for the Untreated Cohort Proportion, $p_0$**\nWe have $n_0=1$ and $x_0=1$.\nThe lower bound, $p_{0,L}$, is found by solving the equation for $x_0=1$:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{1} \\binom{1}{k} p_{0,L}^k (1-p_{0,L})^{1-k} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\binom{1}{1} p_{0,L}^1 (1-p_{0,L})^{0} = 0.025\n$$\n$$\np_{0,L} = 0.025\n$$\n\nThe upper bound, $p_{0,U}$, for an observed count of $x_0=n_0=1$ is conventionally set to $1$. The defining equation for $p_U$ would be $\\sum_{k=0}^{1} \\binom{1}{k} p_U^k (1-p_U)^{1-k} = 1 = \\alpha/2$, which has no solution for $p_U \\in [0,1]$. Thus, by convention, $p_{0,U} = 1$.\nThe $95\\%$ CI for $p_0$ is $[p_{0,L}, p_{0,U}] = [0.025, 1]$.\n\n**Confidence Interval for the Relative Risk, $RR = p_1/p_0$**\nThe problem asks to construct the CI for $RR$ by an \"appropriate monotone transformation\". This implies using the CIs for $p_1$ and $p_0$ to find the range of possible values for their ratio. The function $f(p_1, p_0) = p_1/p_0$ is monotonically increasing with respect to $p_1$ and monotonically decreasing with respect to $p_0$ (for $p_0  0$). Therefore, the bounds of the CI for $RR$ can be found by combining the bounds of the CIs for $p_1$ and $p_0$.\n\nLet the CI for $p_1$ be $[L_1, U_1]$ and the CI for $p_0$ be $[L_0, U_0]$. The CI for $RR$ is $[RR_L, RR_U]$, where:\n$$\nRR_L = \\frac{L_1}{U_0} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad RR_U = \\frac{U_1}{L_0}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated CI bounds:\n$L_1 = p_{1,L} = 0$\n$U_1 = p_{1,U} = 1 - (0.025)^{1/10}$\n$L_0 = p_{0,L} = 0.025$\n$U_0 = p_{0,U} = 1$\n\nThe upper endpoint of the CI for $RR$ is:\n$$\nRR_U = \\frac{p_{1,U}}{p_{0,L}} = \\frac{1 - (0.025)^{1/10}}{0.025}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value.\nFirst, calculate the term $(0.025)^{1/10}$:\n$$\n(0.025)^{0.1} \\approx 0.691490204\n$$\nThen, calculate $p_{1,U}$:\n$$\np_{1,U} = 1 - 0.691490204 = 0.308509796\n$$\nFinally, calculate $RR_U$:\n$$\nRR_U = \\frac{0.308509796}{0.025} \\approx 12.34039184\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to four significant figures.\n$$\nRR_U \\approx 12.34\n$$\nThis upper endpoint represents the maximum plausible multiplicative increase in risk that is consistent with the observed data, under the specified model and statistical method.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{12.34}\n$$", "id": "4904651"}]}
