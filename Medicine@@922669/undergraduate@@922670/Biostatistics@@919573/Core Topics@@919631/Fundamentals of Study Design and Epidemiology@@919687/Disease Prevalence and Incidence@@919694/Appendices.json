A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe three requested quantities—incidence rate, $1$-year cumulative incidence, and point prevalence—will be computed in order, based on their standard definitions in public health.\n\n**1. Incidence Rate ($IR$)**\n\nThe incidence rate, also known as incidence density, measures the rate at which new cases occur in a population over a specified period, relative to the total time the population was observed and at risk. Its formula is:\n$$\nIR = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases}}{\\text{Total person-time at risk}}\n$$\nThe problem provides the number of new cases, $I = 50$, and the total person-time at risk, $PT = 5,000$ person-years.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nIR = \\frac{50}{5,000} \\text{ years}^{-1} = 0.01 \\text{ years}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requests this value in cases per person-year, which is equivalent to units of inverse time (e.g., years$^{-1}$). Rounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nIR = 0.01000 \\text{ cases per person-year}\n$$\n\n**2. $1$-Year Cumulative Incidence ($CI$)**\n\nCumulative incidence, also known as risk, is the proportion of a population initially at risk that develops the condition over a specified time interval. It is calculated for a fixed cohort. The formula is:\n$$\nCI = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases during the period}}{\\text{Number of individuals in the population at risk at the start of the period}}\n$$\nThe problem provides the number of new cases over the $1$-year period, $I = 50$, and the size of the population initially at risk, $N_0 = 10,000$.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nCI = \\frac{50}{10,000} = 0.005\n$$\nThis quantity is a unitless proportion. Rounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nCI = 0.005000\n$$\n\n**3. Point Prevalence ($P$)**\n\nPrevalence is the proportion of a population that has a condition at a specific point in time. The problem states that steady-state conditions apply, the incidence rate is constant, and the condition is rare. Under these specific assumptions, a fundamental relationship exists between prevalence ($P$), incidence rate ($IR$), and the average duration of the disease ($D$):\n$$\nP \\approx IR \\times D\n$$\nThis approximation holds because, in a steady state, the rate at which new cases are added to the prevalent pool must equal the rate at which they are removed (due to recovery or death). The rate of new cases is $IR \\times N_{\\text{total}}$, and the rate of removal is $\\frac{\\text{Number of prevalent cases}}{D} = \\frac{P \\times N_{\\text{total}}}{D}$. Equating these gives $IR \\approx \\frac{P}{D}$.\n\nUsing the incidence rate calculated previously ($IR = 0.01 \\text{ years}^{-1}$) and the given average duration of the disease ($D = 4$ years):\n$$\nP \\approx (0.01 \\text{ years}^{-1}) \\times (4 \\text{ years}) = 0.04\n$$\nPrevalence is a unitless proportion. Rounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nP = 0.04000\n$$\n\nThe three computed quantities, rounded to four significant figures, are:\n- Incidence rate: $0.01000$\n- $1$-year cumulative incidence: $0.005000$\n- Point prevalence: $0.04000$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.01000  0.005000  0.04000 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4393149"}, {"introduction": "In the real world, our measurement tools are rarely perfect, and this problem addresses that critical challenge in epidemiology.

The solution process will now proceed.\n\nLet $P$ denote the true prevalence of the disease in the population, defined as $P = \\mathbb{P}(\\text{Disease})$. The goal is to find an estimator for $P$, which we will denote as $\\hat{P}$.\n\nThe probability of an individual testing positive, $\\mathbb{P}(\\text{Test}+)$, can be expressed using the law of total probability, conditional on the true disease status:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\text{Test}+) = \\mathbb{P}(\\text{Test}+\\mid \\text{Disease})\\mathbb{P}(\\text{Disease}) + \\mathbb{P}(\\text{Test}+\\mid \\text{No Disease})\\mathbb{P}(\\text{No Disease})\n$$\nWe are given the definitions of sensitivity, $\\mathrm{Se} = \\mathbb{P}(\\text{Test}+\\mid \\text{Disease})$, and specificity, $\\mathrm{Sp} = \\mathbb{P}(\\text{Test}-\\mid \\text{No Disease})$. The probability of a false positive is $\\mathbb{P}(\\text{Test}+\\mid \\text{No Disease}) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(\\text{Test}-\\mid \\text{No Disease}) = 1 - \\mathrm{Sp}$. The probability of not having the disease is $\\mathbb{P}(\\text{No Disease}) = 1 - P$.\n\nSubstituting these terms into the law of total probability equation yields:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\text{Test}+) = (\\mathrm{Se})(P) + (1 - \\mathrm{Sp})(1 - P)\n$$\nThe observed apparent prevalence, $P^{\\ast}$, is the sample proportion of positive tests, $Y/n$. It is a natural estimator for the population parameter $\\mathbb{P}(\\text{Test}+)$. By the method of moments, we can construct an estimator for $P$ by replacing $\\mathbb{P}(\\text{Test}+)$ with $P^{\\ast}$ and $P$ with its estimator $\\hat{P}$:\n$$\nP^{\\ast} = (\\mathrm{Se})(\\hat{P}) + (1 - \\mathrm{Sp})(1 - \\hat{P})\n$$\nWe now solve this equation for $\\hat{P}$:\n$$\nP^{\\ast} = \\mathrm{Se} \\cdot \\hat{P} + 1 - \\mathrm{Sp} - \\hat{P} + \\mathrm{Sp} \\cdot \\hat{P}\n$$\n$$\nP^{\\ast} - (1 - \\mathrm{Sp}) = \\hat{P}(\\mathrm{Se} + \\mathrm{Sp} - 1)\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{P} = \\frac{P^{\\ast} + \\mathrm{Sp} - 1}{\\mathrm{Se} + \\mathrm{Sp} - 1}\n$$\nThis is the derived estimator for the corrected (true) prevalence.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $\\hat{P}$ using the given data: $P^{\\ast} = 0.12$, $\\mathrm{Se} = 0.90$, and $\\mathrm{Sp} = 0.98$.\n$$\n\\hat{P} = \\frac{0.12 + 0.98 - 1}{0.90 + 0.98 - 1} = \\frac{0.10}{0.88} = \\frac{10}{88} = \\frac{5}{44}\n$$\nNumerically, $\\hat{P} \\approx 0.113636...$. Rounded to four significant figures, the corrected prevalence is $0.1136$.\n\nNow, we derive an approximate expression for the variance of $\\hat{P}$. The estimator $\\hat{P}$ is a function of the random variable $P^{\\ast}$, which we can write as $\\hat{P} = g(P^{\\ast})$. The function is:\n$$\ng(P^{\\ast}) = \\frac{P^{\\ast} + \\mathrm{Sp} - 1}{\\mathrm{Se} + \\mathrm{Sp} - 1}\n$$\nSince $\\mathrm{Se}$ and $\\mathrm{Sp}$ are treated as known constants, the derivative of $g(P^{\\ast})$ with respect to $P^{\\ast}$ is:\n$$\ng'(P^{\\ast}) = \\frac{d}{dP^{\\ast}}\\left(\\frac{P^{\\ast} + \\mathrm{Sp} - 1}{\\mathrm{Se} + \\mathrm{Sp} - 1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Se} + \\mathrm{Sp} - 1}\n$$\nThe delta method provides a large-sample approximation for the variance of a function of a random variable: $\\mathrm{Var}(g(P^{\\ast})) \\approx [g'(\\mathbb{E}[P^{\\ast}])]^2 \\mathrm{Var}(P^{\\ast})$. Assuming $Y \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n, \\pi)$ where $\\pi = \\mathbb{P}(\\text{Test}+)$, the variance of $P^{\\ast} = Y/n$ is $\\mathrm{Var}(P^{\\ast}) = \\frac{\\pi(1-\\pi)}{n}$. A consistent estimator for this variance is $\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(P^{\\ast}) = \\frac{P^{\\ast}(1-P^{\\ast})}{n}$.\n\nCombining these results, the approximate variance of $\\hat{P}$ is estimated by:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{P}) \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Se} + \\mathrm{Sp} - 1}\\right)^2 \\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(P^{\\ast}) = \\frac{P^{\\ast}(1-P^{\\ast})}{n(\\mathrm{Se} + \\mathrm{Sp} - 1)^2}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the approximate variance of the corrected prevalence estimator.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression numerically using the given data: $P^{\\ast}=0.12$, $n=2000$, $\\mathrm{Se}=0.90$, and $\\mathrm{Sp}=0.98$.\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{P}) \\approx \\frac{0.12(1-0.12)}{2000(0.90+0.98-1)^2} = \\frac{0.12(0.88)}{2000(0.88)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{P}) \\approx \\frac{0.12}{2000 \\times 0.88} = \\frac{0.12}{1760} \\approx 0.00006818...\n$$\nIn scientific notation and rounded to two significant figures, the variance is $6.8 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\nThe final answer required is the corrected prevalence, rounded to four significant figures.\nCorrected prevalence $\\hat{P} = 0.1136$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1136}\n$$", "id": "4546935"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice takes a more dynamic view of how disease risk accumulates over time, moving beyond simple average rates.

The hazard function, $h(t)$, is the instantaneous rate of failure (disease onset) at time $t$, conditional on survival up to that time. It relates to the survival function, $S(t)$, by the following differential equation:\n$$\nh(t) = -\\frac{1}{S(t)}\\frac{dS(t)}{dt}\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged for integration:\n$$\n\\frac{dS(t)}{S(t)} = -h(t)dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from time $0$ to a general time $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{S(0)}^{S(t)} \\frac{1}{S'} dS' = -\\int_0^t h(u)du\n$$\nGiven the initial condition $S(0) = 1$, the left side becomes $\\ln(S(t)) - \\ln(S(0)) = \\ln(S(t)) - \\ln(1) = \\ln(S(t))$.
