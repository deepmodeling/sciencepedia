The requested calculations—cumulative incidence, incidence rate, and odds—are standard measures of disease frequency. The provided numerical values are plausible for a large-scale public health study. The problem is based on established principles of biostatistics.\n- **Well-Posed**: All information required to calculate the three quantities is provided. The definitions of cumulative incidence, incidence rate (using person-time), and odds are standard and allow for the computation of unique, meaningful solutions.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, unbiased language and quantitative data.\n- **Consistency Check**: The maximum possible person-time would be $10,000 \\text{ participants} \\times 1 \\text{ year/participant} = 10,000$ person-years. The observed person-time is 8,900 person-years. This discrepancy is explicitly accounted for by \"staggered enrollment, censoring, and losses to follow-up,\" as well as the fact that individuals who develop the disease cease to contribute person-time at risk. The setup is internally consistent and realistic.\n\n**Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a well-posed, scientifically sound, and objective question rooted in the core principles of epidemiology. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe problem asks for the calculation of three fundamental epidemiologic measures from the provided cohort study data. We will compute each measure from first principles.\n\nThe given data are:\n- The initial number of individuals at risk, $N = 10,000$.\n- The number of new disease events observed during the study period, $D = 150$.\n- The total person-time at risk observed during the study, $T_{obs} = 8,900$ person-years.\n\n**1. Cumulative Incidence Proportion (CI)**\n\nThe cumulative incidence proportion, often referred to as risk, is the proportion of a fixed population (a cohort) that develops the outcome of interest over a specified period. It is calculated as the number of new cases divided by the number of individuals at risk at the beginning of the period.\n\nThe formula for cumulative incidence is:\n$$ CI = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases}}{\\text{Number of individuals at risk at baseline}} $$\nUsing the provided data:\n$$ CI = \\frac{D}{N} = \\frac{150}{10,000} = 0.015 $$\nThe problem requires the result to be reported to four significant figures. Therefore, we express the cumulative incidence as $0.01500$.\n\n**2. Incidence Rate (IR)**\n\nThe incidence rate, also known as incidence density, measures the rate at which new events occur in a population. It is particularly useful when follow-up times vary among individuals. It is calculated as the number of new cases divided by the total person-time at risk. The units are typically events per person-time.\n\nThe formula for the incidence rate is:\n$$ IR = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases}}{\\text{Total person-time at risk}} $$\nUsing the provided data:\n$$ IR = \\frac{D}{T_{obs}} = \\frac{150 \\text{ events}}{8,900 \\text{ person-years}} \\approx 0.01685393... \\; \\frac{\\text{events}}{\\text{person-year}} $$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives:\n$$ IR \\approx 0.01685 \\; \\frac{\\text{events}}{\\text{person-year}} $$\n\n**3. Odds of the Event**\n\nThe odds of an event are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring. In the context of this cohort study over a fixed period, this is calculated as the ratio of the number of individuals who experienced the event to the number of individuals who did not.\n\nThe number of individuals who did not experience the event is the initial cohort size minus those who did:\n$$ N - D = 10,000 - 150 = 9,850 $$\nThe formula for the odds of the event is:\n$$ \\text{Odds} = \\frac{\\text{Number of individuals with the event}}{\\text{Number of individuals without the event}} $$\nUsing the derived numbers:\n$$ \\text{Odds} = \\frac{D}{N - D} = \\frac{150}{9,850} \\approx 0.01522842... $$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives:\n$$ \\text{Odds} \\approx 0.01523 $$\n\n**Summary of Results**\n\nThe three requested measures, rounded to four significant figures, are:\n- Cumulative Incidence Proportion: $0.01500$\n- Incidence Rate: $0.01685$ events per person-year\n- Odds of the Event: $0.01523$\n\nThese results are presented in the requested order.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.01500 & 0.01685 & 0.01523 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4910872"}, {"introduction": "Once we can measure frequency, the next step is to measure association by comparing frequencies between groups.

It presents a classic and realistic scenario in biostatistics and epidemiology used to illustrate the critical concept of confounding and the potential for Simpson's paradox. The data are complete, internally consistent, and sufficient to perform all required calculations. The questions are unambiguous and guide a standard epidemiological analysis. The problem does not violate any principles of scientific or mathematical logic, is not based on false premises, and contains no subjective claims. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Solution\nThe analysis will proceed in four parts as requested. The fundamental definitions are:\n- Risk (or cumulative incidence, $CI$): The proportion of a defined group that develops the outcome over a specified time period. If $A$ is the number of individuals who develop the outcome and $N$ is the total number of individuals in the group at the start, the risk is $CI = \\frac{A}{N}$.\n- Risk Ratio ($RR$): The ratio of the risk in an exposed (treated) group ($CI_T$) to the risk in an unexposed (untreated) group ($CI_U$). $RR = \\frac{CI_T}{CI_U}$. An $RR < 1$ suggests a protective effect, an $RR > 1$ suggests a harmful effect, and an $RR = 1$ suggests no association.\n\n#### 1) Stratum-Specific Analysis\n\nFirst, we analyze the data within each stratum (ICU and GW) separately to obtain stratum-specific measures of association.\n\n**ICU Stratum:**\n- Risk among treated patients: $CI_{T, ICU} = \\frac{320}{800} = 0.4$.\n- Risk among untreated patients: $CI_{U, ICU} = \\frac{100}{200} = 0.5$.\n- Stratum-specific risk ratio for ICU: $RR_{ICU} = \\frac{CI_{T, ICU}}{CI_{U, ICU}} = \\frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8$.\n\nSince $RR_{ICU} = 0.8$, which is less than $1$, the analysis within the ICU stratum suggests that the antibiotic is protective, reducing the risk of infection by $20\\%$.\n\n**GW Stratum:**\n- Risk among treated patients: $CI_{T, GW} = \\frac{10}{200} = 0.05$.\n- Risk among untreated patients: $CI_{U, GW} = \\frac{80}{800} = 0.1$.\n- Stratum-specific risk ratio for GW: $RR_{GW} = \\frac{CI_{T, GW}}{CI_{U, GW}} = \\frac{0.05}{0.1} = 0.5$.\n\nSince $RR_{GW} = 0.5$, which is less than $1$, the analysis within the GW stratum also suggests that the antibiotic is protective, reducing the risk of infection by $50\\%$. In both strata, the treatment appears beneficial.\n\n#### 2) Crude (Unstratified) Analysis\n\nNext, we ignore the strata and aggregate the data to calculate a crude risk ratio.\n\n- Total number of treated patients: $N_T = 800 (\\text{ICU}) + 200 (\\text{GW}) = 1000$.\n- Total number of infections among treated patients: $A_T = 320 (\\text{ICU}) + 10 (\\text{GW}) = 330$.\n- Crude risk among treated patients: $CI_{T, crude} = \\frac{A_T}{N_T} = \\frac{330}{1000} = 0.33$.\n\n- Total number of untreated patients: $N_U = 200 (\\text{ICU}) + 800 (\\text{GW}) = 1000$.\n- Total number of infections among untreated patients: $A_U = 100 (\\text{ICU}) + 80 (\\text{GW}) = 180$.\n- Crude risk among untreated patients: $CI_{U, crude} = \\frac{A_U}{N_U} = \\frac{180}{1000} = 0.18$.\n\n- Crude risk ratio: $RR_{crude} = \\frac{CI_{T, crude}}{CI_{U, crude}} = \\frac{0.33}{0.18} \\approx 1.8333$.\n\nThe crude analysis yields $RR_{crude} \\approx 1.83$, which is greater than $1$. This suggests that the antibiotic is harmful, increasing the risk of infection by approximately $83\\%$. This result directly contradicts the findings from the stratified analysis.\n\n#### 3) Confounding and Simpson's Paradox\n\nThe reversal of the association's direction between the stratified and crude analyses is a classic example of Simpson's paradox. This paradox arises due to the presence of a confounding variable. A variable is a confounder if it is associated with both the exposure and the outcome and is not on the causal pathway between them. Here, the admission status (ICU vs. GW) is the confounder.\n\n1.  **Association with Exposure (Treatment):** The proportion of patients receiving the antibiotic differs drastically between strata.\n    - In the ICU stratum, 800 out of 1000 patients (80%) were treated.\n    - In the GW stratum, 200 out of 1000 patients (20%) were treated.\n    Thus, admission status is strongly associated with the likelihood of receiving treatment. ICU patients are far more likely to be treated.\n\n2.  **Association with Outcome (Infection):** The baseline risk of infection is different across strata, independent of treatment. We can observe this by comparing the risk in the untreated groups.\n    - In the ICU, the risk for untreated patients is $CI_{U, ICU} = 0.5$ ($50\\%$).\n    - In the GW, the risk for untreated patients is $CI_{U, GW} = 0.1$ ($10\\%$).\n    The risk of infection is 5 times higher in the ICU, confirming that admission status is a strong risk factor for the outcome.\n\n3.  **Not on the Causal Pathway:** Admission status (a marker of patient severity) precedes the decision to administer the prophylaxis. The treatment does not cause the patient's admission status.\n\nBecause ICU/GW status is a confounder, the crude comparison is invalid. It unfairly compares a treated group composed mostly of high-risk ICU patients (80% of treated patients are from the ICU) with an untreated group composed mostly of low-risk GW patients (80% of untreated patients are from the GW). The crude $RR$ is distorted because it reflects the difference in baseline severity between the comparison groups rather than the true effect of the antibiotic. The stratified analysis controls for this confounding by making \"like-with-like\" comparisons within each severity level, revealing the treatment's true beneficial effect.\n\n#### 4) Pooled Mantel-Haenszel Risk Ratio\n\nTo obtain a single summary measure of effect that is adjusted for the confounding by admission status, we can compute the Mantel-Haenszel pooled risk ratio ($RR_{MH}$). The formula for $RR_{MH}$ is a weighted average of the stratum-specific risk ratios:\n\n$$ RR_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{A_{Ti} N_{Ui}}{N_i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{A_{Ui} N_{Ti}}{N_i}} $$\n\nwhere $i$ indexes the strata ($i=1$ for ICU, $i=2$ for GW), $A_{Ti}$ and $A_{Ui}$ are the event counts in the treated and untreated groups, $N_{Ti}$ and $N_{Ui}$ are the group sizes, and $N_i = N_{Ti} + N_{Ui}$ is the total size of stratum $i$.\n\nThe data for each stratum $i$ can be summarized in a $2 \\times 2$ table:\n\n| Stratum $i$ | Infected | Not Infected | Total |\n|-------------|----------|--------------|-------|\n| Treated     | $A_{Ti}$ | $B_{Ti}$     | $N_{Ti}$ |\n| Untreated   | $A_{Ui}$ | $B_{Ui}$     | $N_{Ui}$ |\n| Total       | $M_{1i}$ | $M_{0i}$     | $N_i$ |\n\nFor Stratum $1$ (ICU):\n- $A_{T1} = 320$, $N_{T1} = 800$\n- $A_{U1} = 100$, $N_{U1} = 200$\n- $N_1 = 800 + 200 = 1000$\n\nFor Stratum $2$ (GW):\n- $A_{T2} = 10$, $N_{T2} = 200$\n- $A_{U2} = 80$, $N_{U2} = 800$\n- $N_2 = 200 + 800 = 1000$\n\nNow, we compute the components of the $RR_{MH}$ formula.\n\nNumerator contribution from Stratum $1$ (ICU):\n$$ \\frac{A_{T1} N_{U1}}{N_1} = \\frac{320 \\times 200}{1000} = 64 $$\nNumerator contribution from Stratum $2$ (GW):\n$$ \\frac{A_{T2} N_{U2}}{N_2} = \\frac{10 \\times 800}{1000} = 8 $$\nTotal Numerator: $\\sum \\frac{A_{Ti} N_{Ui}}{N_i} = 64 + 8 = 72$.\n\nDenominator contribution from Stratum $1$ (ICU):\n$$ \\frac{A_{U1} N_{T1}}{N_1} = \\frac{100 \\times 800}{1000} = 80 $$\nDenominator contribution from Stratum $2$ (GW):\n$$ \\frac{A_{U2} N_{T2}}{N_2} = \\frac{80 \\times 200}{1000} = 16 $$\nTotal Denominator: $\\sum \\frac{A_{Ui} N_{Ti}}{N_i} = 80 + 16 = 96$.\n\nFinally, the Mantel-Haenszel pooled risk ratio is:\n$$ RR_{MH} = \\frac{72}{96} = 0.75 $$\n\nThis pooled estimate of $0.75$ represents the average effect of the treatment across strata, adjusted for the confounding effect of admission status. It is a value between the two stratum-specific risk ratios ($0.5$ and $0.8$) and confirms that the antibiotic is, on average, protective. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n\n$RR_{MH} = 0.7500$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7500}$$", "id": "4910845"}]}
