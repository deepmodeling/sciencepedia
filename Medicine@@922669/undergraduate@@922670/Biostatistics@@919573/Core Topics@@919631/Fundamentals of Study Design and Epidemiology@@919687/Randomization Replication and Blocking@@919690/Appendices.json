This is not merely about collecting more data; it's a systematic approach to increase the precision of our findings. This exercise provides a fundamental hands-on calculation connecting replication (the sample size, $n$) to the desired precision of a treatment effect estimator, measured by its standard error [@problem_id:4945033]. Mastering this relationship is the first step toward designing statistically powerful and efficient studies.", "problem": "A biostatistics team is planning a $2$-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a new treatment against a control. The primary outcome is a continuous measurement, recorded once per subject. Randomization is carried out without blocking, and the design imposes equal replication in the two arms.

No rounding by significant figures is needed beyond identifying this minimal integer.", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the minimal integer sample size per arm, $n$, for a $2$-arm randomized controlled trial. The constraint is that the standard error of the treatment effect estimator, $\\hat{\\tau}$, must not exceed $2$.\n\nFirst, we establish the mathematical expression for the standard error of the estimator. The estimator for the treatment effect, $\\tau = \\mu_T - \\mu_C$, is given by the difference in sample means:\n$$ \\hat{\\tau} = \\bar{Y}_T - \\bar{Y}_C $$\nwhere $\\bar{Y}_T$ is the sample mean of the treatment arm and $\\bar{Y}_C$ is the sample mean of the control arm.\n\nThe standard error of $\\hat{\\tau}$, denoted $SE(\\hat{\\tau})$, is the square root of its variance, $Var(\\hat{\\tau})$:\n$$ SE(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\sqrt{Var(\\hat{\\tau})} $$\nTo find this, we first calculate the variance of $\\hat{\\tau}$:\n$$ Var(\\hat{\\tau}) = Var(\\bar{Y}_T - \\bar{Y}_C) $$\nThe problem states that randomization is carried out without blocking and that different subjects' outcomes are independent. This implies that the two sample means, $\\bar{Y}_T$ and $\\bar{Y}_C$, are independent random variables, as they are calculated from distinct sets of subjects. For two independent random variables, the variance of their difference is the sum of their variances:\n$$ Var(\\hat{\\tau}) = Var(\\bar{Y}_T) + Var(\\bar{Y}_C) $$\nNext, we determine the variance of each sample mean. For a sample of $n$ independent and identically distributed observations with a population variance of $\\sigma^2$, the variance of the sample mean is given by $\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}$. The problem specifies that the per-subject outcome variance is known and equal for both arms, with $\\sigma^2 = 100$. Each arm has a sample size of $n$.\n\nFor the treatment arm:\n$$ Var(\\bar{Y}_T) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} = \\frac{100}{n} $$\nFor the control arm:\n$$ Var(\\bar{Y}_C) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} = \\frac{100}{n} $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $Var(\\hat{\\tau})$:\n$$ Var(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\frac{100}{n} + \\frac{100}{n} = \\frac{200}{n} $$\nNow, we can find the standard error of $\\hat{\\tau}$:\n$$ SE(\\hat{\\tau}) = \\sqrt{Var(\\hat{\\tau})} = \\sqrt{\\frac{200}{n}} $$\nThe problem imposes the constraint that the standard error must be no greater than $2$:\n$$ SE(\\hat{\\tau}) \\leq 2 $$\nSubstituting our expression for the standard error gives the inequality:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\frac{200}{n}} \\leq 2 $$\nTo solve for $n$, we square both sides of the inequality. Since both sides are non-negative, the direction of the inequality is preserved:\n$$ \\frac{200}{n} \\leq 2^2 $$\n$$ \\frac{200}{n} \\leq 4 $$\nSince $n$ is a sample size, it must be a positive integer ($n > 0$). We can therefore multiply both sides of the inequality by $n$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$ 200 \\leq 4n $$\nFinally, we can isolate $n$ by dividing by $4$:\n$$ \\frac{200}{4} \\leq n $$\n$$ 50 \\leq n $$\nThis inequality states that the sample size per arm, $n$, must be at least $50$. The problem asks for the minimal integer value of $n$ that satisfies this condition.

While simple randomization is a valid approach, it can inadvertently lead to an unequal number of subjects in each group, particularly in smaller studies. This problem introduces permuted block randomization, a widely used technique to enforce balance between treatment arms throughout the trial [@problem_id:4945041]. By exploring the combinatorial principles behind this method, you will gain a concrete understanding of how it guarantees balance, thereby protecting the integrity of the experiment.", "problem": "A biostatistics team is designing a two-arm randomized clinical trial with equal allocation and permuted block randomization to ensure balance within blocks.

Give your final answer as a simplified fraction with no units.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of two quantities based on first principles of counting and randomization: first, the number of distinct admissible treatment sequences for a block, and second, the probability of selecting any one particular such sequence.\n\nLet the block size be $B=4$. A treatment sequence for this block is a sequence of length $4$. Let the two treatments be denoted by the labels $A$ and $B$. The problem states that the randomization is restricted such that within each block, exactly $2$ participants are assigned to treatment $A$ and $2$ are assigned to treatment $B$. An admissible sequence is therefore a sequence of length $4$ containing exactly two $A$'s and two $B$'s.\n\nThe first task is to determine the number of distinct admissible treatment sequences. This is a combinatorial problem of arranging a multiset of objects. Our multiset consists of $4$ items: $\\{A, A, B, B\\}$. We wish to find the number of distinct permutations of these items.\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of positions in the sequence, which is the block size, so $N=4$. Let $n_A$ be the number of assignments to treatment $A$, and $n_B$ be the number of assignments to treatment $B$. According to the problem statement, $n_A=2$ and $n_B=2$. Note that $n_A + n_B = 2+2=4=N$.\n\nWe can derive the number of distinct sequences by considering the number of ways to choose the positions for one of the treatments. Let us choose the positions for the two $A$'s first. There are $4$ available positions in the sequence. The number of ways to choose $2$ distinct positions for the $A$'s from a total of $4$ positions is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{4}{2}$.\n\nThe formula for the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}$ is $\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. In our case, $n=4$ and $k=2$.\n$$ \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} $$\nCalculating this value:\n$$ \\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{(2 \\times 1)(2 \\times 1)} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6 $$\nOnce the $2$ positions for the $A$'s are chosen, the remaining $2$ positions are automatically filled by the $B$'s. Therefore, there are exactly $6$ distinct admissible treatment sequences. These sequences are: $AABB$, $ABAB$, $ABBA$, $BAAB$, $BABA$, and $BBAA$. Let's denote the set of these admissible sequences as $\\mathcal{S}$, so the size of this set is $|\\mathcal{S}| = 6$.\n\nThe second task is to deduce the probability that any particular admissible sequence is selected for a given block. The problem states that the implementation `samples uniformly at random from all admissible treatment sequences`. This means that each of the $6$ distinct sequences in $\\mathcal{S}$ is equally likely to be chosen.\n\nLet $s$ be any particular admissible sequence (e.g., $s = AABB$). According to the principle of uniform probability, the probability of selecting any single, specific outcome from a set of equally likely outcomes is the reciprocal of the total number of outcomes.\nThe total number of possible outcomes is the number of distinct admissible sequences, which we calculated to be $|\\mathcal{S}| = 6$.\n\nThe probability $P(s)$ of selecting any particular sequence $s \\in \\mathcal{S}$ is therefore:\n$$ P(s) = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{S}|} = \\frac{1}{6} $$\nThis probability is a simplified fraction as required.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}} $$", "id": "4945041"}, {"introduction": "Our previous exercises assumed that experimental units are independent.
