The assumption of a constant odds ratio is a standard modeling choice (e.g., in logistic regression) used to explore how effect measures can vary across different scales.

The instructions are unambiguous and lead to a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of subjective or opinion-based claims.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. No information is missing or contradictory.\n- **Other criteria**: The problem is not trivial, unrealistic, ill-posed, or unverifiable.
