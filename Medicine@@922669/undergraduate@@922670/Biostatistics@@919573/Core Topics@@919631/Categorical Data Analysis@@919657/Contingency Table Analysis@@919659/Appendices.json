Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) Test Statistic**\n\nThe CMH test assesses the null hypothesis of no association between exposure and disease, conditional on the strata. This corresponds to a common odds ratio of $\\theta=1$. The test statistic (without continuity correction) is:\n$$\nX^2_{CMH} = \\frac{\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{k} [a_i - E(a_i)] \\right)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\text{Var}(a_i)}\n$$\nUnder the null hypothesis and conditioning on the row and column margins of each table (the hypergeometric model), the expected value $E(a_i)$ and variance $\\text{Var}(a_i)$ of the cell count $a_i$ are:\n$$\nE(a_i) = \\frac{(a_i+b_i)(a_i+c_i)}{N_i} = \\frac{R_{1i} C_{1i}}{N_i}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Var}(a_i) = \\frac{(a_i+b_i)(c_i+d_i)(a_i+c_i)(b_i+d_i)}{N_i^2 (N_i-1)} = \\frac{R_{1i} R_{2i} C_{1i} C_{2i}}{N_i^2 (N_i-1)}\n$$\n\nWe calculate these quantities for each stratum:\n- For stratum $1$ ($a_1=12, N_1=40$):\n  - Margins: $R_{11}=12+8=20$, $R_{21}=5+15=20$, $C_{11}=12+5=17$, $C_{21}=8+15=23$.\n  - $E(a_1) = \\frac{20 \\times 17}{40} = 8.5$\n  - $\\text{Var}(a_1) = \\frac{20 \\times 20 \\times 17 \\times 23}{40^2 (40-1)} = \\frac{156400}{1600 \\times 39} = \\frac{156400}{62400} = \\frac{391}{156} \\approx 2.50641$\n  - Observed minus Expected: $a_1 - E(a_1) = 12 - 8.5 = 3.5$\n\n- For stratum $2$ ($a_2=7, N_2=40$):\n  - Margins: $R_{12}=7+13=20$, $R_{22}=11+9=20$, $C_{12}=7+11=18$, $C_{22}=13+9=22$.\n  - $E(a_2) = \\frac{20 \\times 18}{40} = 9.0$\n  - $\\text{Var}(a_2) = \\frac{20 \\times 20 \\times 18 \\times 22}{40^2 (40-1)} = \\frac{158400}{1600 \\times 39} = \\frac{158400}{62400} = \\frac{396}{156} \\approx 2.53846$\n  - Observed minus Expected: $a_2 - E(a_2) = 7 - 9.0 = -2.0$\n\n- For stratum $3$ ($a_3=14, N_3=40$):\n  - Margins: $R_{13}=14+6=20$, $R_{23}=10+10=20$, $C_{13}=14+10=24$, $C_{23}=6+10=16$.\n  - $E(a_3) = \\frac{20 \\times 24}{40} = 12.0$\n  - $\\text{Var}(a_3) = \\frac{20 \\times 20 \\times 24 \\times 16}{40^2 (40-1)} = \\frac{153600}{1600 \\times 39} = \\frac{153600}{62400} = \\frac{384}{156} \\approx 2.46154$\n  - Observed minus Expected: $a_3 - E(a_3) = 14 - 12.0 = 2.0$\n\nNow, we sum the deviations and variances across the strata:\n- Sum of deviations: $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} [a_i - E(a_i)] = 3.5 + (-2.0) + 2.0 = 3.5$\n- Sum of variances: $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\text{Var}(a_i) = \\frac{391}{156} + \\frac{396}{156} + \\frac{384}{156} = \\frac{391+396+384}{156} = \\frac{1171}{156} \\approx 7.50641$\n\nFinally, we compute the CMH statistic:\n$$\nX^2_{CMH} = \\frac{(3.5)^2}{\\frac{1171}{156}} = \\frac{12.25}{1171/156} = \\frac{12.25 \\times 156}{1171} = \\frac{1911}{1171} \\approx 1.6319385...\n$$\nThis statistic is distributed as a chi-squared random variable with $1$ degree of freedom under the null hypothesis. Rounding to four significant figures, we get $X^2_{CMH} \\approx 1.632$.\n\nThe two requested quantities rounded to four significant figures are:\n$\\hat{\\theta}_{MH} = 1.576$\n$X^2_{CMH} = 1.632$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.576 & 1.632\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4905088"}]}
