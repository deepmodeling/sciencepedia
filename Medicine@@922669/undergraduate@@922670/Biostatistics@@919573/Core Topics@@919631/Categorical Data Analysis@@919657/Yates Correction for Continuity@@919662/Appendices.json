Yates's Correction for Continuity**\n\nYates's correction adjusts this formula by subtracting a value of $0.5$ from the absolute difference between the observed and expected frequencies before squaring. This is intended to correct for the error introduced when approximating the discrete sampling distribution of the test statistic with a continuous chi-square distribution.\n\nThe continuity-corrected chi-square statistic, denoted $\\chi^2_Y$, is given by:\n$$\n\\chi^2_Y = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{2} \\frac{(|O_{ij} - E_{ij}| - 0.5)^2}{E_{ij}}\n$$\nA key property for any $2 \\times 2$ table is that the absolute deviation $|O_{ij} - E_{ij}|$ is constant for all four cells. Let's calculate this value:\n$|O_{11} - E_{11}| = |0 - 0.2| = 0.2$\n$|O_{12} - E_{12}| = |1 - 0.8| = 0.2$\n$|O_{21} - E_{21}| = |4 - 3.8| = 0.2$\n$|O_{22} - E_{22}| = |15 - 15.2| = 0.2$\nThis common absolute deviation can also be calculated as $\\frac{|ad-bc|}{N} = \\frac{|(0)(15) - (1)(4)|}{20} = \\frac{|-4|}{20} = 0.2$.\n\nNow, we apply the correction. The numerator term for each cell is $(|O_{ij} - E_{ij}| - 0.5)^2 = (0.2 - 0.5)^2 = (-0.3)^2 = 0.09$.\n\nWe can now compute $\\chi^2_Y$:\n$$\n\\chi^2_Y = \\frac{(0.09)}{0.2} + \\frac{(0.09)}{0.8} + \\frac{(0.09)}{3.8} + \\frac{(0.09)}{15.2}\n$$\nAlternatively, the algebraically equivalent and computationally simpler formula for the corrected statistic is:\n$$\n\\chi^2_Y = \\frac{N(|ad - bc| - \\frac{N}{2})^2}{(a+b)(c+d)(a+c)(b+d)}\n$$\nUsing the given values:\n$a=0, b=1, c=4, d=15, N=20$.\n$|ad - bc| = |(0)(15) - (1)(4)| = |-4| = 4$.\n$a+b = 1$, $c+d = 19$, $a+c = 4$, $b+d = 16$.\n$$\n\\chi^2_Y = \\frac{20(|4| - \\frac{20}{2})^2}{(1)(19)(4)(16)} = \\frac{20(4 - 10)^2}{1216} = \\frac{20(-6)^2}{1216} = \\frac{20(36)}{1216} = \\frac{720}{1216}\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$\\frac{720}{1216} = \\frac{360}{608} = \\frac{180}{304} = \\frac{90}{152} = \\frac{45}{76}$.\n\nTo provide the final answer as a real number rounded to four significant figures:\n$\\chi^2_Y = \\frac{45}{76} \\approx 0.59210526...$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.5921$.\n\n**3. Interpretation of the Continuity Correction**\n\nThe fundamental purpose of a continuity correction is to improve the approximation of the test statistic's discrete sampling distribution by the continuous chi-square distribution. This typically results in a *smaller* test statistic value, leading to a more conservative test (i.e., a larger p-value and a lower Type I error rate).\n\nIn this specific case, the table is sparse (one cell count is $0$, another is $1$). Let's compare the corrected statistic with the uncorrected Pearson chi-square statistic:\n$$\n\\chi^2 = \\frac{N(ad-bc)^2}{(a+b)(c+d)(a+c)(b+d)} = \\frac{20((0)(15)-(1)(4))^2}{1216} = \\frac{20(-4)^2}{1216} = \\frac{20(16)}{1216} = \\frac{320}{1216} = \\frac{5}{19} \\approx 0.2632\n$$\nWe observe that the continuity-corrected statistic, $\\chi^2_Y \\approx 0.5921$, is more than twice as large as the uncorrected statistic, $\\chi^2 \\approx 0.2632$. This is a pathological result that runs counter to the intention of the correction.\n\nThis anomaly occurs because the absolute deviation between observed and expected counts, $|O-E|=0.2$, is less than the correction factor of $0.5$. The formula subtracts $0.5$ from this small value, resulting in a negative number ($-0.3$), which upon squaring ($( -0.3)^2=0.09$) becomes larger than the original squared deviation ($( \\pm 0.2)^2=0.04$). Consequently, the overall statistic increases.\n\nTherefore, for this sparse table where the observed data are already very close to the expectation under the null hypothesis, Yates's correction does not meaningfully address the discreteness of the data. Instead, its mechanistic application produces a distorted and counter-intuitive inflation of the test statistic. This highlights a well-known flaw of Yates's correction: it can severely over-correct, especially in tables with small marginal totals or when the deviation from expectation is small. For such sparse tables, an exact method like Fisher's exact test, which does not rely on a continuous approximation, is the preferred analytical tool.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5921}$$", "id": "4966732"}, {"introduction": "Statistical analysis in the real world involves more than just calculation; it requires sound judgment and ethical practice.

Investigators plan to test for association between treatment and abstinence at level $\\alpha = 0.05$ using a Pearson chi-square test for a $2 \\times 2$ table.

Because the uncorrected Pearson chi-square yields $p  0.05$, it is appropriate to declare statistical significance at $\\alpha = 0.05$ even if a primary analysis plan prespecified using a continuity correction; choosing the smaller $p$-value after seeing the data does not affect the Type I error rate.\n\nB.

The formula for the expected frequency in cell $(i, j)$ is $E_{ij} = \\frac{(\\text{Row}_i \\text{ Total}) \\times (\\text{Column}_j \\text{ Total})}{N}$.\n\n-   $E_{11}$ (Intervention, Abstinent): $\\frac{12 \\times 11}{24} = 5.5$\n-   $E_{12}$ (Intervention, Not Abstinent): $\\frac{12 \\times 13}{24} = 6.5$\n-   $E_{21}$ (Usual Care, Abstinent): $\\frac{12 \\times 11}{24} = 5.5$\n-   $E_{22}$ (Usual Care, Not Abstinent): $\\frac{12 \\times 13}{24} = 6.5$\n\nThe uncorrected Pearson chi-square statistic is calculated as $\\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O - E)^2}{E}$.\n\n$$ \\chi^2 = \\frac{(3 - 5.5)^2}{5.5} + \\frac{(9 - 6.5)^2}{6.5} + \\frac{(8 - 5.5)^2}{5.5} + \\frac{(4 - 6.5)^2}{6.5} $$\n$$ \\chi^2 = \\frac{(-2.5)^2}{5.5} + \\frac{(2.5)^2}{6.5} + \\frac{(2.5)^2}{5.5} + \\frac{(-2.5)^2}{6.5} $$\n$$ \\chi^2 = \\frac{6.25}{5.5} + \\frac{6.25}{6.5} + \\frac{6.25}{5.5} + \\frac{6.25}{6.5} = 2 \\times (1.1363...) + 2 \\times (0.9615...) $$\nA more precise calculation using fractions is:\n$$ \\chi^2 = 2 \\times 6.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{5.5} + \\frac{1}{6.5}\\right) = 12.5 \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{11} + \\frac{2}{13}\\right) = 25 \\times \\left(\\frac{13+11}{11 \\times 13}\\right) = 25 \\times \\frac{24}{143} = \\frac{600}{143} \\approx 4.1958 $$\nThe degrees of freedom for a $2 \\times 2$ table are $(r-1)(c-1) = (2-1)(2-1) = 1$. The critical value for a $\\chi^2$ distribution with $1$ degree of freedom at $\\alpha = 0.05$ is $\\chi^2_{1, 0.05} \\approx 3.841$.\nSince our calculated statistic $\\chi^2 \\approx 4.196$ is greater than the critical value $3.841$, the corresponding $p$-value is less than $0.05$. The actual $p$-value is $P(\\chi^2_1 \\ge 4.1958) \\approx 0.0405$.\nBased on the uncorrected test, the association is statistically significant at the $\\alpha = 0.05$ level.\n\n**2. Chi-Square Test with Yates's Continuity Correction**\n\nYates's continuity correction adjusts the formula to better approximate the discrete probability distribution of the cell counts with the continuous chi-square distribution. The formula is $\\chi^2_c = \\sum \\frac{(|O - E| - 0.5)^2}{E}$.\n\n$$ \\chi^2_c = \\frac{(|3 - 5.5| - 0.5)^2}{5.5} + \\frac{(|9 - 6.5| - 0.5)^2}{6.5} + \\frac{(|8 - 5.5| - 0.5)^2}{5.5} + \\frac{(|4 - 6.5| - 0.5)^2}{6.5} $$\n$$ \\chi^2_c = \\frac{(2.5 - 0.5)^2}{5.5} + \\frac{(2.5 - 0.5)^2}{6.5} + \\frac{(2.5 - 0.5)^2}{5.5} + \\frac{(2.5 - 0.5)^2}{6.5} $$\n$$ \\chi^2_c = \\frac{(2.0)^2}{5.5} + \\frac{(2.0)^2}{6.5} + \\frac{(2.0)^2}{5.5} + \\frac{(2.0)^2}{6.5} = \\frac{4}{5.5} + \\frac{4}{6.5} + \\frac{4}{5.5} + \\frac{4}{6.5} $$\nUsing fractions for precision:\n$$ \\chi^2_c = 2 \\times 4 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{5.5} + \\frac{1}{6.5}\\right) = 8 \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{11} + \\frac{2}{13}\\right) = 16 \\times \\left(\\frac{13+11}{11 \\times 13}\\right) = 16 \\times \\frac{24}{143} = \\frac{384}{143} \\approx 2.6853 $$\nThe test statistic with continuity correction is $\\chi^2_c \\approx 2.685$. Since $2.685  3.841$ (the critical value for $\\alpha=0.05$), the corresponding $p$-value is greater than $0.05$. The actual $p$-value is $P(\\chi^2_1 \\ge 2.6853) \\approx 0.1013$.\nBased on the continuity-corrected test, the association is not statistically significant at the $\\alpha = 0.05$ level.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\nLet's evaluate each statement based on the above calculations and the fundamental principles of statistical inference.\n\n**A. Because the uncorrected Pearson chi-square yields $p  0.05$, it is appropriate to declare statistical significance at $\\alpha = 0.05$ even if a primary analysis plan prespecified using a continuity correction; choosing the smaller $p$-value after seeing the data does not affect the Type I error rate.**\n\nThis statement is critically flawed. The cornerstone of frequentist hypothesis testing is the pre-specification of an analysis plan. This plan, which includes the choice of test statistic and significance level, must be established *before* observing the data. Doing so ensures that the long-run probability of a Type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis) is controlled at the nominal level $\\alpha$. Choosing an analysis method post hoc based on which one yields a desired result (e.g., $p  0.05$) is a form of \"p-hacking.\" This practice inflates the true Type I error rate above the nominal $\\alpha$ because the researcher is effectively giving themselves multiple chances to find a significant result. The claim that this \"does not affect the Type I error rate\" is false.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. If the prespecified plan for small-sample $2 \\times 2$ tables uses a continuity-corrected chi-square test, then the appropriate conclusion at $\\alpha = 0.05$ is that the association is not statistically significant in this sample; switching post hoc to the uncorrected test after inspecting the data inflates the Type I error rate.**\n\nThis statement accurately describes proper statistical conduct. If the analysis plan was pre-specified to use the continuity-corrected test, the researcher is bound by that plan. Our calculation showed that the continuity-corrected test yields $p \\approx 0.101$, which is greater than $\\alpha = 0.05$. Therefore, the correct conclusion under the pre-specified plan is to fail to reject the null hypothesis, meaning the association is not statistically significant. The statement correctly identifies that abandoning this plan to use the uncorrected test (which yielded $p  0.05$) would be a post hoc decision that inflates the Type I error rate.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The discrepancy between the two $p$-values proves that both chi-square methods are invalid here; the only acceptable interpretation is that the null hypothesis is true because a conservative correction failed to reach significance.**\n\nThis statement contains multiple logical fallacies. First, a discrepancy between two approximate methods, especially in a borderline case, does not \"prove\" that both are invalid. It simply illustrates the known limitations of using continuous distributions to approximate discrete ones in small samples. The uncorrected test can be slightly anti-conservative (rejects too often), while the Yates correction can be overly conservative (fails to reject too often). Second, and more importantly, failing to reject a null hypothesis is not equivalent to proving the null hypothesis is true. It simply means the evidence in the sample was not strong enough to meet the pre-specified threshold for rejecting $H_0$. This is the principle of \"absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.\" The conclusion that \"the null hypothesis is true\" is an overstatement that statistical testing does not support.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. A defensible practice is to report the estimated effect size (for example, the odds ratio) and a confidence interval, and to disclose both $p$-values transparently, while basing the formal decision on the prespecified method; this preserves nominal error rates and conveys uncertainty without post hoc switching.**\n\nThis statement describes a principled and modern approach to statistical reporting.\n- **Basing the formal decision on the prespecified method:** This is essential for maintaining the integrity of the hypothesis test and controlling the Type I error rate, as discussed for option B.\n- **Reporting effect size and confidence interval:** The odds ratio ($OR = \\frac{ad}{bc} = \\frac{3 \\times 4}{9 \\times 8} = \\frac{12}{72} \\approx 0.167$) quantifies the strength and direction of the association, which is arguably more informative than a binary p-value decision. A confidence interval for this OR would describe the range of plausible values for the true effect.\n- **Disclosing both $p$-values:** Transparency is a key scientific virtue. Reporting both p-values allows the reader to understand the sensitivity of the conclusion to the choice of analytical method and to appreciate that the result is borderline.\nThis comprehensive approach upholds formal error control while providing a much richer and more honest summary of the evidence than a simple \"significant\" or \"not significant\" declaration.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BD}$$", "id": "4966719"}]}
