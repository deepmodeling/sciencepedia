A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the Pearson chi-squared statistic for a $3 \\times 3$ contingency table of observed counts. First, we organize the given counts, which we denote as $O_{ij}$, into a table and compute the marginal totals. Let $i$ be the row index (for genotype $G$) and $j$ be the column index (for disease status $S$).\n\nThe table of observed counts $O_{ij}$ is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc|c}\n  S_{0}  S_{1}  S_{2}  \\text{Row Total } (n_{i+}) \\\\\n\\hline\nG_{0}  98  35  17  150 \\\\\nG_{1}  72  43  35  150 \\\\\nG_{2}  30  28  62  120 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Column Total } (n_{+j})  200  106  114  420\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe row totals are:\n$n_{0+} = 98 + 35 + 17 = 150$\n$n_{1+} = 72 + 43 + 35 = 150$\n$n_{2+} = 30 + 28 + 62 = 120$\n\nThe column totals are:\n$n_{+0} = 98 + 72 + 30 = 200$\n$n_{+1} = 35 + 43 + 28 = 106$\n$n_{+2} = 17 + 35 + 62 = 114$\n\nThe grand total number of subjects is $N = 150 + 150 + 120 = 420$.\n\nThe Pearson chi-squared test evaluates the null hypothesis $H_0$ that the two categorical variables, genotype $G$ and disease status $S$, are independent. Under this hypothesis, the joint probability of observing an individual in cell $(i, j)$ is the product of the marginal probabilities: $p_{ij} = p_{i+} p_{+j}$.\n\nWe estimate these marginal probabilities from the data:\n$\\hat{p}_{i+} = \\frac{n_{i+}}{N}$\n$\\hat{p}_{+j} = \\frac{n_{+j}}{N}$\n\nThe expected count $E_{ij}$ for each cell $(i, j)$ under the independence hypothesis is then calculated as:\n$$E_{ij} = N \\times \\hat{p}_{i+} \\times \\hat{p}_{+j} = N \\left( \\frac{n_{i+}}{N} \\right) \\left( \\frac{n_{+j}}{N} \\right) = \\frac{n_{i+} n_{+j}}{N}$$\n\nUsing this formula, we compute the expected counts for all $9$ cells:\n$E_{00} = \\frac{150 \\times 200}{420} = \\frac{30000}{420} = \\frac{500}{7} \\approx 71.429$\n$E_{01} = \\frac{150 \\times 106}{420} = \\frac{15900}{420} = \\frac{265}{7} \\approx 37.857$\n$E_{02} = \\frac{150 \\times 114}{420} = \\frac{17100}{420} = \\frac{285}{7} \\approx 40.714$\n\n$E_{10} = \\frac{150 \\times 200}{420} = \\frac{30000}{420} = \\frac{500}{7} \\approx 71.429$\n$E_{11} = \\frac{150 \\times 106}{420} = \\frac{15900}{420} = \\frac{265}{7} \\approx 37.857$\n$E_{12} = \\frac{150 \\times 114}{420} = \\frac{17100}{420} = \\frac{285}{7} \\approx 40.714$\n\n$E_{20} = \\frac{120 \\times 200}{420} = \\frac{24000}{420} = \\frac{400}{7} \\approx 57.143$\n$E_{21} = \\frac{120 \\times 106}{420} = \\frac{12720}{420} = \\frac{212}{7} \\approx 30.286$\n$E_{22} = \\frac{120 \\times 114}{420} = \\frac{13680}{420} = \\frac{228}{7} \\approx 32.571$\n\nThe Pearson chi-squared test statistic, denoted by $\\chi^2$, is defined as the sum of the squared differences between observed and expected counts, each divided by the expected count:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\sum_{i=0}^{2} \\sum_{j=0}^{2} \\frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}$$\n\nWe now calculate each term in the sum:\nTerm for $(0,0)$: $\\frac{(98 - 71.429)^2}{71.429} = \\frac{(26.571)^2}{71.429} \\approx 9.8846$\nTerm for $(0,1)$: $\\frac{(35 - 37.857)^2}{37.857} = \\frac{(-2.857)^2}{37.857} \\approx 0.2156$\nTerm for $(0,2)$: $\\frac{(17 - 40.714)^2}{40.714} = \\frac{(-23.714)^2}{40.714} \\approx 13.8125$\n\nTerm for $(1,0)$: $\\frac{(72 - 71.429)^2}{71.429} = \\frac{(0.571)^2}{71.429} \\approx 0.0046$\nTerm for $(1,1)$: $\\frac{(43 - 37.857)^2}{37.857} = \\frac{(5.143)^2}{37.857} \\approx 0.6987$\nTerm for $(1,2)$: $\\frac{(35 - 40.714)^2}{40.714} = \\frac{(-5.714)^2}{40.714} \\approx 0.8020$\n\nTerm for $(2,0)$: $\\frac{(30 - 57.143)^2}{57.143} = \\frac{(-27.143)^2}{57.143} \\approx 12.8929$\nTerm for $(2,1)$: $\\frac{(28 - 30.286)^2}{30.286} = \\frac{(-2.286)^2}{30.286} \\approx 0.1725$\nTerm for $(2,2)$: $\\frac{(62 - 32.571)^2}{32.571} = \\frac{(29.429)^2}{32.571} \\approx 26.5890$\n\nSumming these terms gives the $\\chi^2$ statistic:\n$\\chi^2 \\approx 9.8846 + 0.2156 + 13.8125 + 0.0046 + 0.6987 + 0.8020 + 12.8929 + 0.1725 + 26.5890$\n$\\chi^2 \\approx 65.0724$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the result to four significant figures.

Proceeding to the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe fundamental definition of the conditional probability of an event $A$ given an event $B$ is\n$$ P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} $$\nThis definition is valid only if $P(B)  0$. If $P(B) = 0$, the conditional probability is undefined.\n\nIn the context of the given problem, we are interested in the conditional probability of the outcome $Y=j$ given the exposure category $X=i$. This is expressed as:\n$$ P(Y=j \\mid X=i) = \\frac{P(Y=j, X=i)}{P(X=i)} $$\nUsing the notation from the problem statement, this corresponds to:\n$$ P(Y=j \\mid X=i) = \\frac{p_{ij}}{p_{i+}} $$\nThe problem provides sample counts $n_{ij}$, which we use to compute empirical probabilities (denoted with a hat, $\\hat p$). The total sample size is $N=75$. We are asked to consider the case where a row marginal is zero, specifically for $i=3$.\n\nFirst, we compute the row totals and the empirical row marginal probabilities:\n- For $i=1$: $n_{1+} = n_{10} + n_{11} = 36 + 9 = 45$. The empirical marginal probability is $\\hat p_{1+} = 45/75 = 3/5$.\n- For $i=2$: $n_{2+} = n_{20} + n_{21} = 24 + 6 = 30$. The empirical marginal probability is $\\hat p_{2+} = 30/75 = 2/5$.\n- For $i=3$: $n_{3+} = n_{30} + n_{31} = 0 + 0 = 0$. The empirical marginal probability is $\\hat p_{3+} = 0/75 = 0$.\n\nThe problem focuses on the conditional probabilities for stratum $X=3$. For this stratum, the conditioning event, $\\{X=3\\}$, has an empirical probability of $\\hat p_{3+} = 0$. The joint probabilities involving this stratum are also zero:\n- $\\hat p_{30} = n_{30}/N = 0/75 = 0$.\n- $\\hat p_{31} = n_{31}/N = 0/75 = 0$.\n\nNow, we attempt to calculate the empirical conditional probability $\\hat P(Y=j \\mid X=3)$:\n$$ \\hat P(Y=j \\mid X=3) = \\frac{\\hat p_{3j}}{\\hat p_{3+}} = \\frac{0}{0} $$\nThis expression is a ratio of $0$ over $0$, which is mathematically indeterminate and undefined. Therefore, based on the standard definition of conditional probability, $P(Y=j \\mid X=3)$ cannot be calculated from the given data.\n\nWith this foundation, we evaluate each of the given options.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $P(Y=j \\mid X=3)$ is undefined because $p_{3+} = 0$; conditioning on an event with zero probability is not permitted by the definition of conditional probability. In practice, conditional analyses that condition on $X=3$ cannot be conducted without introducing external modeling assumptions, smoothing, or redefining categories to ensure positive probability.**\n\nThis statement accurately reflects the mathematical situation and its practical consequences.\n- The first part correctly states that the conditional probability is undefined because the conditioning event has a probability of zero ($p_{3+}=0$). This directly follows from the definition $P(A \\mid B) = P(A \\cap B)/P(B)$ which requires $P(B)0$.\n- The second part correctly describes the common remedies in statistical practice for dealing with zero-count cells. When we cannot compute a stratum-specific estimate due to lack of data, we must resort to methods like:\n    - **Modeling**: Assume a parametric model (e.g., logistic regression) that relates the outcomes across different strata. This allows \"borrowing strength\" but relies on the model specification being correct.\n    - **Smoothing**: Add small pseudo-counts to all cells (e.g., Bayesian approach with priors, or simple continuity corrections like adding $0.5$) to ensure all marginals are positive.\n    - **Redefining categories**: Collapse the category with zero counts into an adjacent category, assuming they are similar enough.\nThis statement is a complete and accurate summary of the issue.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Because $n_{3+} = 0$, the correct convention is that $P(Y=j \\mid X=3) = 0$ for all $j$. With this assignment, conditional analyses that condition on $X=3$ remain valid.**\n\nThis statement proposes a convention. For any fixed condition (e.g., $X=3$), the conditional probabilities of all possible outcomes must sum to $1$. This is a fundamental axiom of probability: $\\sum_j P(Y=j \\mid X=i) = 1$ for any given $i$.\nIf we were to adopt the convention $P(Y=j \\mid X=3) = 0$ for all $j \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, then the sum would be:\n$$ P(Y=0 \\mid X=3) + P(Y=1 \\mid X=3) = 0 + 0 = 0 $$\nSince $0 \\neq 1$, this convention violates a basic law of probability. Therefore, it is not a \"correct convention\" and would render subsequent analyses invalid, not valid.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The estimated conditional probabilities for the defined strata are $P(Y=1 \\mid X=1) = 9/45$ and $P(Y=1 \\mid X=2) = 6/30$, and by continuity of ratios when the denominator is $0$, $P(Y=1 \\mid X=3) = 0$.**\n\nThe first part of the statement correctly calculates the empirical conditional probabilities for strata $1$ and $2$:\n- $\\hat P(Y=1 \\mid X=1) = n_{11} / n_{1+} = 9/45 = 1/5$.\n- $\\hat P(Y=1 \\mid X=2) = n_{21} / n_{2+} = 6/30 = 1/5$.\nHowever, the reasoning for the $X=3$ case is fallacious. It claims that \"by continuity of ratios when the denominator is $0$, $P(Y=1 \\mid X=3) = 0$\". The ratio for $X=3$ is $\\hat p_{31} / \\hat p_{3+} = 0/0$. In calculus, the form $0/0$ is indeterminate. The limit of a ratio $f(x)/g(x)$ as $f(x) \\to 0$ and $g(x) \\to 0$ can be any value, or may not exist. There is no general principle of \"continuity of ratios\" that assigns the value $0$ to a $0/0$ expression. The reasoning is mathematically unsound.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. If $p_{i+} = 0$, then $p_{ij} = 0$ for all $j$, and therefore $P(Y=j \\mid X=i)$ is undefined. In model-based analyses (for example, logistic regression or stratified risk estimation), parameters or stratum-specific risks involving $X=i$ are not identifiable without constraints, borrowing strength, or prior information; this is a manifestation of a violation of the positivity (overlap) assumption.**\n\nThis statement provides a detailed and technically precise account.\n- \"If $p_{i+} = 0$, then $p_{ij} = 0$ for all $j$\": This is correct. Since $p_{i+} = \\sum_j p_{ij}$ and joint probabilities $p_{ij}$ are non-negative, the sum can be zero only if every term in the sum is zero.\n- \"... and therefore $P(Y=j \\mid X=i)$ is undefined\": As established, the ratio $p_{ij}/p_{i+}$ becomes $0/0$, which is undefined. This is correct.\n- The remainder of the statement correctly explains the implication for statistical modeling. Non-identifiability is the precise term for the inability to estimate a parameter from the data. If there are no subjects with $X=3$, no data exists to inform any parameter that describes the effect of $X=3$ (e.g., a coefficient in a regression model).\n- Finally, it correctly identifies this issue as a violation of the \"positivity assumption\" (also known as the overlap or common support assumption in causal inference), which requires that every individual in the population has a non-zero probability of being in any given exposure/treatment group, i.e., $P(X=i)  0$ for all $i$. In our sample, the empirical probability $\\hat P(X=3)=0$, indicating a lack of support in the data for this assumption.\nThis statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. A zero row marginal forces $P(Y=j \\mid X=i) = P(Y=j)$, since conditioning on an impossible event leaves the distribution unchanged and the conditional reduces to the marginal.**\n\nThis statement claims that if $p_{i+} = 0$, then conditioning on $X=i$ is equivalent to independence. The condition for independence between events $A=\\{Y=j\\}$ and $B=\\{X=i\\}$ is $P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$. Given $P(B)=p_{i+}=0$, we have $P(A \\cap B) = p_{ij} = 0$ (as shown in the analysis for D). The independence equation becomes $0 = P(A) \\cdot 0$, which is true for any $P(A)$. So, technically, an event of probability zero is independent of any other event.\nHowever, this does not imply that $P(A \\mid B) = P(A)$. This latter formula is a *consequence* of independence that is only valid when $P(B)  0$, as it is derived from $P(A \\cap B) / P(B) = P(A)$, which requires division by $P(B)$. The fundamental premise that \"conditioning on an impossible event leaves the distribution unchanged\" is not a standard axiom or theorem of probability; in fact, conditioning on a zero-probability event is simply not defined in this elementary framework. The option makes an invalid logical leap.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n### Conclusion\nStatements A and D are both correct. They describe the same core issue from slightly different but complementary perspectives. Statement A gives a general overview of the problem and practical solutions, while Statement D provides a more technical explanation in the context of statistical modeling, introducing key terms like \"identifiability\" and \"positivity.\"", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "4920943"}, {"introduction": "We conclude with a powerful demonstration of why understanding conditional probability is critical for sound scientific reasoning.

The provided data can be organized into two contingency tables, one for each stratum of $Z$.\n\nFor stratum $Z=0$ (low frailty):\n|           | $Y=1$ (Recovery) | $Y=0$ (No Recovery) | Total |\n|-----------|------------------|---------------------|-------|\n| $X=1$ (Therapy) | $9$              | $1$                 | $10$    |\n| $X=0$ (No Therapy) | $80$             | $20$                | $100$   |\n\nFor stratum $Z=1$ (high frailty):\n|           | $Y=1$ (Recovery) | $Y=0$ (No Recovery) | Total |\n|-----------|------------------|---------------------|-------|\n| $X=1$ (Therapy) | $30$             | $20$                | $50$    |\n| $X=0$ (No Therapy) | $5$              | $15$                | $20$    |\n\n**Task 1: Stratum-Specific Odds Ratios**\n\nThe odds of recovery ($Y=1$) for a given exposure level $x$ within a specific stratum $z$ is defined as $Odds(Y=1 \\mid X=x, Z=z) = \\frac{p(Y=1 \\mid X=x, Z=z)}{p(Y=0 \\mid X=x, Z=z)}$. Since probabilities are proportional to frequencies within a defined subgroup, we can use the counts directly:\n$$Odds(Y=1 \\mid X=x, Z=z) = \\frac{N(x,1,z)}{N(x,0,z)}$$\nThe stratum-specific odds ratio, $OR_z$, compares the odds of recovery for the treated group ($X=1$) to the untreated group ($X=0$) within that stratum:\n$$OR_z = \\frac{Odds(Y=1 \\mid X=1, Z=z)}{Odds(Y=1 \\mid X=0, Z=z)} = \\frac{N(1,1,z) / N(1,0,z)}{N(0,1,z) / N(0,0,z)} = \\frac{N(1,1,z) \\cdot N(0,0,z)}{N(1,0,z) \\cdot N(0,1,z)}$$\n\nFor stratum $Z=0$ (low frailty):\nThe odds of recovery for the treated group are $Odds(Y=1 \\mid X=1, Z=0) = \\frac{9}{1} = 9$.\nThe odds of recovery for the untreated group are $Odds(Y=1 \\mid X=0, Z=0) = \\frac{80}{20} = 4$.\nThe stratum-specific odds ratio is:\n$$OR_0 = \\frac{9}{4} = 2.25$$\nAs required, $OR_0 = 2.25 > 1$. This indicates that among low-frailty individuals, the therapy is associated with $2.25$ times the odds of recovery compared to no therapy.\n\nFor stratum $Z=1$ (high frailty):\nThe odds of recovery for the treated group are $Odds(Y=1 \\mid X=1, Z=1) = \\frac{30}{20} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$.\nThe odds of recovery for the untreated group are $Odds(Y=1 \\mid X=0, Z=1) = \\frac{5}{15} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nThe stratum-specific odds ratio is:\n$$OR_1 = \\frac{3/2}{1/3} = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 3 = \\frac{9}{2} = 4.5$$\nAs required, $OR_1 = 4.5 > 1$. This indicates that among high-frailty individuals, the therapy is associated with $4.5$ times the odds of recovery compared to no therapy. In both strata, the therapy appears beneficial.\n\n**Task 2: Pooled Marginal Odds Ratio**\n\nTo compute the pooled marginal odds ratio, we first aggregate the counts across the strata of $Z$ to form a marginal table of $X$ and $Y$.\n- $N(X=1, Y=1) = N(1,1,0) + N(1,1,1) = 9 + 30 = 39$\n- $N(X=1, Y=0) = N(1,0,0) + N(1,0,1) = 1 + 20 = 21$\n- $N(X=0, Y=1) = N(0,1,0) + N(0,1,1) = 80 + 5 = 85$\n- $N(X=0, Y=0) = N(0,0,0) + N(0,0,1) = 20 + 15 = 35$\n\nThe aggregated contingency table is:\n|           | $Y=1$ (Recovery) | $Y=0$ (No Recovery) |\n|-----------|------------------|---------------------|\n| $X=1$ (Therapy) | $39$             | $21$                |\n| $X=0$ (No Therapy) | $85$             | $35$                |\n\nThe pooled marginal odds ratio, $OR_{marginal}$, is calculated from this aggregated table:\n$$OR_{marginal} = \\frac{N(X=1,Y=1) \\cdot N(X=0,Y=0)}{N(X=1,Y=0) \\cdot N(X=0,Y=1)} = \\frac{39 \\cdot 35}{21 \\cdot 85}$$\nTo simplify the fraction:\n$$OR_{marginal} = \\frac{(3 \\cdot 13) \\cdot (5 \\cdot 7)}{(3 \\cdot 7) \\cdot (5 \\cdot 17)} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 13}{3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 17} = \\frac{13}{17}$$\nWe confirm that $OR_{marginal} = \\frac{13}{17}  1$. This is the paradox: the marginal analysis suggests that the therapy is associated with lower odds of recovery, directly contradicting the stratum-specific findings.\n\n**Task 3: Explanation and Causal Interpretation**\n\nThe reversal of association is a hallmark of Simpson's paradox and occurs due to confounding. Here, frailty ($Z$) is a confounder because it is associated with both the exposure (therapy, $X$) and the outcome (recovery, $Y$).\n\nThe marginal probability of an outcome is a weighted average of the conditional probabilities across strata of the confounder, as described by the law of total probability:\n$$p(Y=y \\mid X=x) = \\sum_{z \\in \\{0,1\\}} p(Y=y \\mid X=x, Z=z) \\cdot p(Z=z \\mid X=x)$$\nThe paradox arises because the weighting factors, $p(Z=z \\mid X=x)$, are substantially different for the treated ($X=1$) and untreated ($X=0$) groups.\n\nLet's calculate these weights:\n- For the treated group ($X=1$), the total number of subjects is $N(X=1) = 10 + 50 = 60$.\n  - $p(Z=1 \\mid X=1) = \\frac{N(X=1, Z=1)}{N(X=1)} = \\frac{50}{60} = \\frac{5}{6}$\n- For the untreated group ($X=0$), the total number of subjects is $N(X=0) = 100 + 20 = 120$.\n  - $p(Z=1 \\mid X=0) = \\frac{N(X=0, Z=1)}{N(X=0)} = \\frac{20}{120} = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\nThis shows a strong association between $Z$ and $X$: the treated group is predominantly composed of high-frailty individuals ($p(Z=1|X=1) = 5/6$), while the untreated group is predominantly low-frailty ($p(Z=0|X=0) = 100/120 = 5/6$). This is a classic example of \"confounding by indication\", where sicker (higher frailty) patients are more likely to receive the therapy.\n\nFurthermore, frailty is strongly associated with the outcome. The probability of recovery is much lower in the high-frailty stratum ($Z=1$) than in the low-frailty stratum ($Z=0$), regardless of treatment.\n- $p(Y=1 \\mid X=1, Z=0) = 9/10 = 0.9$ vs $p(Y=1 \\mid X=1, Z=1) = 30/50 = 0.6$\n- $p(Y=1 \\mid X=0, Z=0) = 80/100 = 0.8$ vs $p(Y=1 \\mid X=0, Z=1) = 5/20 = 0.25$\n\nThe marginal probability of recovery for the treated, $p(Y=1 \\mid X=1)$, is a weighted average of the stratum-specific probabilities $p(Y=1 \\mid X=1, Z=0)=0.9$ and $p(Y=1 \\mid X=1, Z=1)=0.6$. Since the treated group is mostly high-frailty, this average is heavily weighted towards the lower probability ($0.6$), resulting in a lower overall recovery rate: $p(Y=1 \\mid X=1) = (0.9)\\frac{1}{6} + (0.6)\\frac{5}{6} = 0.15 + 0.5 = 0.65$.\n\nConversely, the marginal probability of recovery for the untreated, $p(Y=1 \\mid X=0)$, is a weighted average of $p(Y=1 \\mid X=0, Z=0)=0.8$ and $p(Y=1 \\mid X=0, Z=1)=0.25$. Since the untreated group is mostly low-frailty, this average is heavily weighted towards the higher probability ($0.8$), resulting in a higher overall recovery rate: $p(Y=1 \\mid X=0) = (0.8)\\frac{5}{6} + (0.25)\\frac{1}{6} \\approx 0.708$.\n\n**Causal Interpretation:** The marginal odds ratio ($OR_{marginal}  1$) is not a valid estimate of the causal effect of the therapy. It is biased by the confounding effect of frailty. The comparison is unfair because it pools healthy people who didn't get the therapy with frail people who did. The stratified odds ratios, $OR_0$ and $OR_1$, control for the confounder by holding it constant. Since both are greater than $1$, they suggest that the therapy is beneficial for patients of both low and high frailty. Therefore, the causal conclusion, based on this data, is that the therapy is effective. The marginal result is a statistical artifact.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{13}{17}}$$", "id": "4920952"}]}
