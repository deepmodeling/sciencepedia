From this, the fundamental property of the conditional expectation follows:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X=x]=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}x.\n$$\nInterpretation of coefficients under this model is based on the conditional mean function.\n\nInterpretation of the intercept $\\hat{\\beta}_{0}$: The intercept corresponds to the expected value of $Y$ when $X=0$. Specifically, replacing the population parameters with their estimators for interpretation,\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathbb{E}}[Y \\mid X=0]=\\hat{\\beta}_{0}.\n$$\nThus, $\\hat{\\beta}_{0}=110$ is interpreted as the estimated mean systolic blood pressure, in millimeters of mercury, for an individual with $0$ grams of daily sodium intake, acknowledging that $0$ grams lies outside the observed range and therefore this interpretation involves extrapolation.\n\nInterpretation of the slope $\\hat{\\beta}_{1}$: The slope is the marginal change in the conditional mean of $Y$ per unit increase in $X$.
