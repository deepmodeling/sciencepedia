The method involves a chemical reaction that produces a colored compound, and the student uses a smartphone camera to quantify the color intensity. To create a calibration curve, the student prepares a series of standard solutions of known nitrite concentration and measures the corresponding signal intensity. The collected data is as follows:\n\n-   Standard Concentrations ($C$, in $\\mu M$): 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0\n-   Measured Signals ($S$, in arbitrary units): 7.0, 14.5, 23.0, 30.5, 37.0\n\nA linear regression analysis on this data yields the best-fit line equation $S = (1.57 \\times C) + 5.61$, with a coefficient of determination $R^2 = 0.9996$.\n\nDespite the very high $R^2$ value, which suggests an excellent linear fit, the student decides to examine the data more closely by plotting the residuals.

The pattern in the residuals suggests that the true relationship between concentration and signal is non-linear. The linear model is a poor choice for this system and should be discarded.\n\nD. The systematic pattern in the residuals indicates that while the relationship is strongly linear, it is not perfectly linear. A linear model may not be the most accurate model, and a non-linear model (e.g., quadratic) would likely provide a better fit and more accurate results.\n\nE.

A single gross preparation error would produce one large outlying residual, not a smooth, concentration-dependent pattern spanning multiple points. Finally, a high $R^{2}$ alone does not validate the functional form; it can remain high over a limited range even when curvature is present, and residual analysis is the appropriate diagnostic for such nonlinearity.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that the relationship is strongly but not perfectly linear, and a non-linear model (such as a quadratic) would likely improve the fit and prediction accuracy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1455423"}, {"introduction": "As we expand our models to include multiple predictors, the standard coefficient of determination, $R^2$, develops a critical flaw: it never decreases when a new variable is added, regardless of that variable's true utility.

The total variability in the response variable is partitioned into the variability explained by the model and the unexplained (residual) variability.\n\nThe Total Sum of Squares ($SST$) measures the total variance of the dependent variable $y$. It is defined as $SST = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2$, where $n$ is the sample size and $\\bar{y}$ is the sample mean of $y$.\n\nThe Regression Sum of Squares ($SSR$) measures the amount of variance in the dependent variable explained by the regression model. It is defined as $SSR = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\hat{y}_i - \\bar{y})^2$, where $\\hat{y}_i$ are the fitted values from the model.\n\nThe Residual Sum of Squares ($SSE$), also known as the Sum of Squared Errors, measures the unexplained variance. It is defined as $SSE = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$.\n\nThe fundamental ANOVA identity is:\n$$SST = SSR + SSE$$\n\nThe standard coefficient of determination, $R^2$, is defined as the proportion of the total variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.\n$$R^2 = \\frac{SSR}{SST} = 1 - \\frac{SSE}{SST}$$\nA known issue with $R^2$ is that it is a biased estimator of the population coefficient of determination. It never decreases when new predictors are added to the model, even if they are irrelevant. This can lead to an overly optimistic assessment of model fit, a phenomenon known as overfitting, especially when the number of predictors, $p$, is large relative to the sample size, $n$.\n\nThe adjusted coefficient of determination, $R_{adj}^2$, corrects for this by penalizing the inclusion of extraneous predictors. It does so by using unbiased estimators for the variances. The unbiased estimator of the total population variance, $\\sigma_y^2$, is the Mean Square Total ($MST$), which is the total sum of squares divided by its degrees of freedom, $df_T = n-1$.\n$$MST = \\frac{SST}{n-1}$$\nThe unbiased estimator of the error variance, $\\sigma^2$, is the Mean Square Error ($MSE$), which is the residual sum of squares divided by its degrees of freedom, $df_E$. For a multiple linear regression with $p$ predictors and an intercept, the total number of estimated coefficients is $k = p+1$. Therefore, the degrees of freedom for error are:\n$df_E = n - (p+1) = n-p-1$\nThe Mean Square Error is thus:\n$$MSE = \\frac{SSE}{n-p-1}$$\nThe adjusted $R^2$ is defined analogously to $R^2$ but uses these unbiased estimators of variance:\n$$R_{adj}^2 = 1 - \\frac{MSE}{MST} = 1 - \\frac{SSE/(n-p-1)}{SST/(n-1)}$$\nTo express $R_{adj}^2$ in terms of the original $R^2$, we can rearrange this expression:\n$$R_{adj}^2 = 1 - \\left(\\frac{SSE}{SST}\\right) \\left(\\frac{n-1}{n-p-1}\\right)$$\nFrom the definition of $R^2$, we know that $\\frac{SSE}{SST} = 1 - R^2$. Substituting this into the equation for $R_{adj}^2$ yields the desired relationship:\n$$R_{adj}^2 = 1 - (1 - R^2) \\frac{n-1}{n-p-1}$$\nThis expression shows how the adjusted $R^2$ is derived from $R^2$ by applying a penalty factor, $\\frac{n-1}{n-p-1}$, which is always greater than $1$ for $p0$. This factor increases as $p$ increases or as $n$ decreases, making the adjustment more severe for models with many predictors relative to the sample size.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Computation**\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nSample size, $n = 60$.\nNumber of explanatory variables, $p = 10$.\nCoefficient of determination, $R^2 = 0.35$.\n\nUsing the derived formula:\n$$R_{adj}^2 = 1 - (1 - R^2) \\frac{n-1}{n-p-1}$$\nSubstitute the given values into the expression:\n$$R_{adj}^2 = 1 - (1 - 0.35) \\frac{60-1}{60-10-1}$$\n$$R_{adj}^2 = 1 - (0.65) \\frac{59}{49}$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$$R_{adj}^2 = 1 - 0.65 \\times \\left(\\frac{59}{49}\\right) \\approx 1 - 0.65 \\times 1.2040816...$$\n$$R_{adj}^2 \\approx 1 - 0.78265306...$$\n$$R_{adj}^2 \\approx 0.2173469...$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives:\n$$R_{adj}^2 \\approx 0.2173$$\n\n**Part 3: Assessment of the Change in Interpretation**\n\nThe original coefficient of determination, $R^2 = 0.35$, suggests that the model explains $35\\%$ of the variance in the baseline log-transformed C-reactive protein. In many medical research contexts, this would be considered a modest but potentially meaningful level of explanatory power.\n\nThe adjusted coefficient of determination, $R_{adj}^2 \\approx 0.2173$, indicates that after accounting for the number of predictors used in the model relative to the sample size, the estimated proportion of variance explained is only about $21.7\\%$.\n\nThe decrease from $0.35$ to $0.2173$ represents a substantial drop. The absolute reduction is $0.35 - 0.2173 = 0.1327$. The relative reduction is $\\frac{0.1327}{0.35} \\approx 0.379$, which is a nearly $38\\%$ decrease from the original $R^2$ value.\n\nThis change is highly meaningful and would almost certainly affect conclusions about the model's explanatory strength. The relatively large number of predictors ($p=10$) for a modest sample size ($n=60$) creates significant potential for overfitting. The unadjusted $R^2$ is inflated by this fact. The adjusted $R^2$ provides a more realistic (and sobering) assessment of the model's performance on the population from which the sample was drawn.\n\nIn the evidence-based medical field, this is a critical distinction. A model explaining $35\\%$ of the variance might be seen as a promising starting point for developing a predictive tool. In contrast, a model explaining only $21.7\\%$ of the variance would be considered to have limited explanatory strength. Such a result would temper enthusiasm and suggest that the set of predictors, while perhaps statistically significant, does not constitute a powerful explanatory framework. It would prompt investigators to seek more influential predictors, consider model simplification, or conclude that the outcome is inherently difficult to predict with the available data. The penalty for model complexity has, in this case, meaningfully changed the interpretation from \"modest utility\" to \"limited utility\".", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2173}$$", "id": "4795902"}]}
