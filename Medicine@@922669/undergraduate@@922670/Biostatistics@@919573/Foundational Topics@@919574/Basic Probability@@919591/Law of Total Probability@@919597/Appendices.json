This final exercise, a variation of the classic Monty Hall problem, shows how it works in tandem with conditional probability to update our beliefs in light of new evidence.

The car is placed randomly, with an equal probability of being behind any of the three doors.\n2. The contestant picks one door (say, Door 1).\n3. The host, who knows where the car is, opens one of the other two doors to reveal a goat.\n4. The contestant is then given the option to stick with their original choice (Door 1) or switch to the other unopened door.\n\nThe two hosts have different behavioral patterns that only manifest when the contestant's initial choice is correct.\n- If the contestant's initial choice is incorrect, the host is forced to open the only remaining door that contains a goat. For example, if the contestant picks Door 1 and the car is behind Door 2, the host must open Door 3.\n- If the contestant's initial choice is correct (e.g., they pick Door 1 and the car is behind Door 1), the host has a choice between opening Door 2 or Door 3. In this scenario:\n    - Host A will open Door 2 with probability $p_A$ and Door 3 with probability $1-p_A$.\n    - Host B will open Door 2 with probability $p_B$ and Door 3 with probability $1-p_B$.\n\nSuppose you are the contestant. You pick Door 1, and you observe the host opening Door 3. Given this information, derive the probability that you will win the car if you switch your choice to Door 2.
