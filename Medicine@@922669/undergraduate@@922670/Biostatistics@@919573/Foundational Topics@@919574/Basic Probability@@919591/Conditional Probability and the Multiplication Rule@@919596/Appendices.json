Stratum-Specific Probabilities and Comparison**\n\nWe compute the stratum-specific probabilities of recovery ($A$) given treatment status ($B$ or $B^c$) and disease severity stratum ($C$).

This verifies that $P(A \\mid B, C)  P(A \\mid B^c, C)$ within each stratum $C$.\n\n**2. Marginal Probabilities and Explanation of Reversal**\n\nWe express the marginal probabilities $P(A \\mid B)$ and $P(A \\mid B^c)$ using the law of total probability, conditioning on the partition $\\{C=\\text{High}, C=\\text{Low}\\}$.\nThe formula for $P(A \\mid B)$ is:\n$$P(A \\mid B) = P(A \\mid B, C=\\text{High})P(C=\\text{High} \\mid B) + P(A \\mid B, C=\\text{Low})P(C=\\text{Low} \\mid B)$$\nSimilarly, for $P(A \\mid B^c)$:\n$$P(A \\mid B^c) = P(A \\mid B^c, C=\\text{High})P(C=\\text{High} \\mid B^c) + P(A \\mid B^c, C=\\text{Low})P(C=\\text{Low} \\mid B^c)$$\n\nThe terms $P(C \\mid B)$ and $P(C \\mid B^c)$ act as weights. We compute these from the data:\nTotal patients in group $B$: $N(B) = N(B \\cap \\{C=\\text{High}\\}) + N(B \\cap \\{C=\\text{Low}\\}) = 900 + 100 = 1000$.\nTotal patients in group $B^c$: $N(B^c) = N(B^c \\cap \\{C=\\text{High}\\}) + N(B^c \\cap \\{C=\\text{Low}\\}) = 100 + 900 = 1000$.\n\nThe weights for the treated group ($B$) are:\n$P(C=\\text{High} \\mid B) = \\frac{N(B \\cap \\{C=\\text{High}\\})}{N(B)} = \\frac{900}{1000} = 0.9$\n$P(C=\\text{Low} \\mid B) = \\frac{N(B \\cap \\{C=\\text{Low}\\})}{N(B)} = \\frac{100}{1000} = 0.1$\n\nThe weights for the untreated group ($B^c$) are:\n$P(C=\\text{High} \\mid B^c) = \\frac{N(B^c \\cap \\{C=\\text{High}\\})}{N(B^c)} = \\frac{100}{1000} = 0.1$\n$P(C=\\text{Low} \\mid B^c) = \\frac{N(B^c \\cap \\{C=\\text{Low}\\})}{N(B^c)} = \\frac{900}{1000} = 0.9$\n\nNow, we compute the marginal probabilities using the weighted averages:\n$P(A \\mid B) = (0.20)(0.9) + (0.98)(0.1) = 0.18 + 0.098 = 0.278$.\n$P(A \\mid B^c) = (0.15)(0.1) + (0.95)(0.9) = 0.015 + 0.855 = 0.870$.\n\nWe can verify these directly from the total counts:\nTotal recoveries in group $B$: $N(A \\cap B) = 180 + 98 = 278$.\n$P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{N(A \\cap B)}{N(B)} = \\frac{278}{1000} = 0.278$.\nTotal recoveries in group $B^c$: $N(A \\cap B^c) = 15 + 855 = 870$.\n$P(A \\mid B^c) = \\frac{N(A \\cap B^c)}{N(B^c)} = \\frac{870}{1000} = 0.870$.\nThe calculations are consistent.\n\nThe marginal comparison is $P(A \\mid B) = 0.278$ and $P(A \\mid B^c) = 0.870$, which shows that $P(A \\mid B)  P(A \\mid B^c)$. This is a reversal of the association observed within each stratum.\n\nThe explanation for this reversal (Simpson's Paradox) lies in the confounding effect of disease severity ($C$). The variable $C$ is a confounder because it is associated with both the treatment ($B$) and the outcome ($A$). Specifically:\n- $C$ is associated with outcome $A$: Patients with low severity have a much higher chance of recovery, regardless of treatment ($0.98$ and $0.95$ for low severity vs. $0.20$ and $0.15$ for high severity).\n- $C$ is associated with treatment $B$: The distribution of disease severity is vastly different between the treated and untreated groups. In the treated group ($B$), $90\\%$ of patients have high-severity disease ($P(C=\\text{High} \\mid B) = 0.9$). In the untreated group ($B^c$), only $10\\%$ have high-severity disease; conversely, $90\\%$ have low-severity disease ($P(C=\\text{Low} \\mid B^c) = 0.9$).\nThis indicates that the therapy was preferentially administered to patients with high-severity disease, who have a poor prognosis. The marginal probability $P(A \\mid B)$ is a weighted average heavily influenced by the low recovery rate of the high-severity group. In contrast, the marginal probability $P(A \\mid B^c)$ is heavily influenced by the high recovery rate of the low-severity group, which constitutes $90\\%$ of the untreated population. This imbalance in the prognostic factor $C$ across the treatment groups creates a misleading marginal association, masking the therapy's benefit within each homogeneous stratum.\n\n**3. Marginal Risk Difference**\n\nThe marginal risk difference is the difference between the marginal probabilities of recovery for the treated and untreated groups.\n$$ \\text{Risk Difference} = P(A \\mid B) - P(A \\mid B^c) $$\nUsing the computed values:\n$$ \\text{Risk Difference} = 0.278 - 0.870 = -0.592 $$\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures.\n$$ \\text{Risk Difference} \\approx -0.5920 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.5920}$$", "id": "4901792"}]}
