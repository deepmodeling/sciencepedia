It also demands a justification for the formula used for the sample variance, grounded in the concept of unbiased estimation. The problem is scientifically and statistically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information.\n\nThe given data are a simple random sample of $n=6$ SBP values: $X = \\{120, 126, 130, 140, 142, 150\\}$. The units are millimeters of mercury (mmHg).\n\nFirst, we calculate the sample mean ($\\bar{x}$), which is a prerequisite for calculating the sample variance and standard deviation. The sample mean is the sum of the observations divided by the number of observations.\n$$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i $$\n$$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{120 + 126 + 130 + 140 + 142 + 150}{6} = \\frac{808}{6} = \\frac{404}{3} \\approx 134.67 \\text{ mmHg} $$\n\n**1. Range**\n\nThe range ($R$) is the simplest measure of dispersion, defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.\n$$ R = x_{\\text{max}} - x_{\\text{min}} $$\nFrom the dataset, the maximum value is $x_{\\text{max}} = 150$ and the minimum value is $x_{\\text{min}} = 120$.\n$$ R = 150 - 120 = 30 $$\nTo four significant figures, the range is $30.00$.\n\nClinical Interpretation: The range of $30$ mmHg indicates that the total spread of SBP values within this sample of six patients is $30$ mmHg. This is the difference between the patient with the highest blood pressure ($150$ mmHg) and the patient with the lowest ($120$ mmHg).\n\n**2. Sample Variance ($s^2$)**\n\nThe problem requires a foundational justification for the choice of the sample variance estimator. The sample variance, denoted $s^2$, is an estimator for the true but unknown population variance, $\\sigma^2$. A critical property of a good estimator is that it be unbiased, meaning its expected value over all possible samples of size $n$ is equal to the parameter it is estimating.\n\nIf the population mean $\\mu$ were known, an unbiased estimator for $\\sigma^2$ would be $\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \\mu)^2$. However, $\\mu$ is unknown and must be estimated from the data using the sample mean, $\\bar{x}$. The sum of squared deviations from the sample mean, $\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2$, is minimized at $\\bar{x}$, meaning it is always less than or equal to the sum of squared deviations from the true mean $\\mu$ (i.e., $\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\leq \\sum(x_i - \\mu)^2$ for any sample).\n\nConsequently, using a denominator of $n$ with the sample mean, as in $\\frac{1}{n}\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2$, would systematically underestimate the true population variance. The expected value of this biased estimator is $E\\left[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2\\right] = \\frac{n-1}{n}\\sigma^2$.\n\nTo correct for this underestimation, we use the denominator $n-1$ instead of $n$. This is known as Bessel's correction. The resulting estimator for the sample variance is:\n$$ s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 $$\nThis estimator is unbiased, as its expected value is equal to the population variance: $E[s^2] = \\sigma^2$. The term $n-1$ represents the degrees of freedom. Since one degree of freedom is 'used up' to estimate the mean from the data (as the deviations $x_i - \\bar{x}$ must sum to zero), only $n-1$ of these deviations are free to vary.\n\nNow, we compute the value of $s^2$ for the given data. We first calculate the sum of squared deviations (SS):\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\left(x_i - \\frac{404}{3}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ = \\left(120 - \\frac{404}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(126 - \\frac{404}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(130 - \\frac{404}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(140 - \\frac{404}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(142 - \\frac{404}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(150 - \\frac{404}{3}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ = \\left(-\\frac{44}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{26}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{14}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{16}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{22}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{46}{3}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ = \\frac{1936}{9} + \\frac{676}{9} + \\frac{196}{9} + \\frac{256}{9} + \\frac{484}{9} + \\frac{2116}{9} = \\frac{5664}{9} = 629.333... $$\nNow, we divide by the degrees of freedom, $n-1 = 6-1=5$:\n$$ s^2 = \\frac{629.333...}{5} = 125.8666... $$\nRounded to four significant figures, the sample variance is $125.9$.\n\nClinical Interpretation: The sample variance is $125.9 \\text{ mmHg}^2$. The units of variance (squared units of measurement) are not directly intuitive in a clinical context. Its primary role is as a mathematically fundamental measure of dispersion that forms the basis for other statistical tests and for the standard deviation.\n\n**3. Sample Standard Deviation ($s$)**\n\nThe sample standard deviation ($s$) is the positive square root of the sample variance. It is preferred for interpretation because its units are the same as the original data.\n$$ s = \\sqrt{s^2} $$\n$$ s = \\sqrt{125.8666...} \\approx 11.21903... $$\nRounded to four significant figures, the sample standard deviation is $11.22$.\n\nClinical Interpretation: The sample standard deviation is $11.22$ mmHg. This value represents a typical or average amount by which an individual patient's SBP deviates from the sample mean SBP of $134.7$ mmHg. A patient with an SBP of $145.9$ mmHg ($134.7+11.2$) would be considered one standard deviation above the mean for this sample. A larger standard deviation would signify greater heterogeneity in blood pressure readings among the patients, while a smaller value would indicate the readings are more tightly clustered around the average.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 30.00 & 125.9 & 11.22 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4812293"}, {"introduction": "A skilled practitioner knows not only how to use their tools but also understands their limitations.

The recorded values from pipeline $A$ are `A=[5,6,6,7,8]`, and from pipeline $B$ are `B=[5,5,5,5,13]`. Assume all values are on the same measurement scale and represent independent replicate measurements from the same underlying process. Begin from the core definition of order statistics in a finite sample and derive the dispersion of each pipeline using the extreme-value-based measure that depends only on the smallest and largest observed values in the sample. Then, quantify the effect of the single extreme value in $B$ on interpretability by computing the ratio of the extreme-value-based dispersion for $B$ to that for $A$. Provide this ratio as a simplified exact fraction with no rounding.

For a finite sample $X_{1},\\dots,X_{n}$, let $X_{(1)}=\\min\\{X_{1},\\dots,X_{n}\\}$ denote the smallest order statistic and $X_{(n)}=\\max\\{X_{1},\\dots,X_{n}\\}$ denote the largest order statistic. The extreme-value-based measure of dispersion derived from order statistics is the difference between the largest and smallest observations, which is the range. Symbolically, the range $R$ of a sample $X_{1},\\dots,X_{n}$ is\n$$\nR \\equiv X_{(n)} - X_{(1)}.\n$$\nThis definition uses only the two extreme values and no other sample information.\n\nCompute the range for pipeline $A$.

If a single observation is spuriously high due to a preanalytical or analytical issue (for example, transient instrument malfunction, sample mix-up, or contamination), then $X_{(n)}$ can be shifted far from the rest of the data, inflating $R$ even if the bulk of measurements are consistent. In $B$, four observations are $5$, and one observation is $13$. The range increases from $3$ in $A$ to $8$ in $B$, a factor of $\\frac{8}{3}$, even though most of the $B$ observations coincide at $5$, suggesting that the underlying measurement process for the majority of replicates has low spread.\n\nIn contrast, dispersion measures that incorporate all observations, such as the sample variance $s^{2}$ and sample standard deviation $s$, weight deviations across the entire dataset:\n$$\n\\bar{x}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i},\\quad s^{2}=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-\\bar{x})^{2},\\quad s=\\sqrt{s^{2}}.\n$$\nFor $A$, $\\bar{x}_{A}=\\frac{5+6+6+7+8}{5}=\\frac{32}{5}=6.4$ and\n$$\ns_{A}^{2}=\\frac{1}{4}\\big[(5-6.4)^{2}+(6-6.4)^{2}+(6-6.4)^{2}+(7-6.4)^{2}+(8-6.4)^{2}\\big]=\\frac{5.20}{4}=1.30,\\quad s_{A}=\\sqrt{1.30}.\n$$\nFor $B$, $\\bar{x}_{B}=\\frac{5+5+5+5+13}{5}=\\frac{33}{5}=6.6$ and\n$$\ns_{B}^{2}=\\frac{1}{4}\\big[(5-6.6)^{2}+(5-6.6)^{2}+(5-6.6)^{2}+(5-6.6)^{2}+(13-6.6)^{2}\\big]=\\frac{51.20}{4}=12.80,\\quad s_{B}=\\sqrt{12.80}.\n$$\nThese quantities show inflation due to the outlier, but they also reflect the concentration of four values at $5$ through the mean and the distribution of squared deviations. Robust dispersion measures that reduce sensitivity to extreme values, such as the Interquartile Range (IQR), defined by $Q_{3}-Q_{1}$ where $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{3}$ are the first and third quartiles, and the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD), defined by $\\mathrm{MAD}=\\mathrm{median}(|x_{i}-\\mathrm{median}(x)|)$, are less affected. For $A$, the median is $6$ and $\\mathrm{MAD}_{A}=\\mathrm{median}(\\{|5-6|, |6-6|, |6-6|, |7-6|, |8-6|\\})=\\mathrm{median}(\\{1,0,0,1,2\\})=1$.

Thus, while the range in $B$ is inflated by the extreme value, the MAD indicates that the central bulk of $B$ is extremely tight. This contrast illustrates that reliance on the range alone can be misleading in clinical quality assessment when outliers occur; using measures that consider the full distribution or robust measures provides a more interpretable characterization of assay precision.\n\nThe requested final numerical quantity, the ratio of ranges, is $\\frac{8}{3}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{8}{3}}$$", "id": "4812168"}, {"introduction": "We conclude by moving from single-sample description to a common scenario in evidence-based medicine: comparing two distinct groups in a clinical study.

It is a standard problem in statistical inference with clear instructions and sufficient data. Therefore, a full solution is warranted.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Pooled Variance Estimator**\n\nThe derivation begins from the definition of the sample variance for a single group. The unbiased sample variance, $s^2$, for a sample of size $n$ with observations $x_i$ and sample mean $\\bar{x}$, is defined as the sum of squared deviations from the mean divided by the degrees of freedom:\n$$ s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 $$\nThis quantity is an unbiased estimator of the population variance $\\sigma^2$. The numerator, $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2$, is known as the sum of squares ($SS$) about the mean, and it is associated with $df = n-1$ degrees of freedom.\n\nFor group A, with sample size $n_A$ and sample variance $s_A^2$, the sum of squares is:\n$$ SS_A = (n_A - 1)s_A^2 $$\nThis sum of squares has $df_A = n_A - 1$ degrees of freedom.\n\nSimilarly, for group B, with sample size $n_B$ and sample variance $s_B^2$, the sum of squares is:\n$$ SS_B = (n_B - 1)s_B^2 $$\nThis sum of squares has $df_B = n_B - 1$ degrees of freedom.\n\nThe problem assumes the existence of a single shared population variance, $\\sigma^2$, common to both groups. To create a single, more precise estimator for this common variance, we combine, or \"pool,\" the information from both independent samples. As stipulated, we invoke the principle of the additivity of independent sums of squares. Since the two groups in a randomized study are independent, we can sum their respective sums of squares to get a total or pooled sum of squares, $SS_p$:\n$$ SS_p = SS_A + SS_B = (n_A - 1)s_A^2 + (n_B - 1)s_B^2 $$\nThe degrees of freedom associated with this pooled sum of squares are also additive due to independence:\n$$ df_p = df_A + df_B = (n_A - 1) + (n_B - 1) = n_A + n_B - 2 $$\nThe pooled variance estimator, denoted $s_p^2$, is defined as this pooled sum of squares divided by the pooled degrees of freedom. This provides a weighted average of the individual sample variances, with the weights being their respective degrees of freedom.\n$$ s_p^2 = \\frac{SS_p}{df_p} = \\frac{(n_A - 1)s_A^2 + (n_B - 1)s_B^2}{(n_A - 1) + (n_B - 1)} = \\frac{(n_A - 1)s_A^2 + (n_B - 1)s_B^2}{n_A + n_B - 2} $$\nThis expression is the estimator for the common variance derived from first principles.\n\n**2. Computation of the Pooled Variance**\n\nThe given data are:\nFor group A: $n_A = 25$, $s_A^2 = 9$.\nFor group B: $n_B = 35$, $s_B^2 = 16$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula for $s_p^2$:\n$$ s_p^2 = \\frac{(25 - 1) \\cdot 9 + (35 - 1) \\cdot 16}{25 + 35 - 2} $$\n$$ s_p^2 = \\frac{24 \\cdot 9 + 34 \\cdot 16}{58} $$\n$$ s_p^2 = \\frac{216 + 544}{58} $$\n$$ s_p^2 = \\frac{760}{58} $$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. Both are even, so dividing by $2$:\n$$ s_p^2 = \\frac{380}{29} $$\nSince $29$ is a prime number and $380 = 2^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 19$ is not divisible by $29$, this fraction is in its simplest form.\n\n**3. Minimal Statistical Assumptions**\n\nThe justification for pooling variance estimates rests on three primary assumptions:\n\n1.  **Homogeneity of Variance (Homoscedasticity)**: This is the most critical assumption. It posits that the true population variances of the two groups are equal, i.e., $\\sigma_A^2 = \\sigma_B^2 = \\sigma^2$. The pooled variance $s_p^2$ is an estimator of this single common variance $\\sigma^2$. If this assumption is violated, the pooled estimator is biased and can lead to incorrect statistical inferences.\n2.  **Independence of Samples**: The observations from group A must be statistically independent of the observations from group B. In the context of a randomized comparative study, randomization of participants to treatment arms is the standard procedure to ensure this independence holds.\n3.  **Normality**: For the pooled variance estimator to be used in formal inferential procedures such as the two-sample t-test or the construction of confidence intervals, it is assumed that the data within each group are sampled from a normal distribution. That is, the standardized changes in systolic blood pressure for group A follow a $N(\\mu_A, \\sigma^2)$ distribution, and for group B, a $N(\\mu_B, \\sigma^2)$ distribution. While the point estimate $s_p^2$ can be calculated without this assumption, its sampling distribution (a scaled chi-square distribution) and subsequent use in hypothesis testing depend on normality.\n\n**4. Realistic Failure of Assumptions and Analytical Remedy**\n\nA realistic way for these assumptions to fail in this clinical context is the violation of the homogeneity of variance. The two antihypertensive therapies might not only have different mean effects but also different effects on the variability of the response. For instance, therapy A might have a consistent, moderate effect across all patients, resulting in a smaller variance. Therapy B might be a novel drug that is highly effective for a subset of patients (e.g., those with a particular genetic marker) but has little or no effect on others. This differential response would lead to a much larger variance in the outcomes for group B compared to group A, meaning $\\sigma_A^2 \\neq \\sigma_B^2$.\n\nThe appropriate analytical remedy when there is evidence of heteroscedasticity is to use statistical methods that do not rely on the assumption of equal variances. For comparing the means of two independent groups, the standard remedy is **Welch's t-test**. Unlike the pooled-variance t-test, Welch's test does not pool the sample variances. Instead, the test statistic is computed using the individual sample variances:\n$$ t_{Welch} = \\frac{\\bar{x}_A - \\bar{x}_B}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_A^2}{n_A} + \\frac{s_B^2}{n_B}}} $$\nThe degrees of freedom for this statistic are not simply $n_A + n_B - 2$, but are instead approximated using the **Welch-Satterthwaite equation**. This approach provides a more robust and reliable inference about the difference in means when the population variances cannot be assumed to be equal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{380}{29}}$$", "id": "4812171"}]}
