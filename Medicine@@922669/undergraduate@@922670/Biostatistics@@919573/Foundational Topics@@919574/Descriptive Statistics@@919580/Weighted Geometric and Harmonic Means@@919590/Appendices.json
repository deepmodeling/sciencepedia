It is a well-formulated problem in applied statistics that tests fundamental concepts. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires us to perform two calculations and then use statistical principles to justify the choice of a summary statistic.\n\n**1. Computation of Sample Statistics**\n\nFirst, we compute the sample median and the sample geometric mean for the given data set $x=\\{2, 3, 4, 5, 50, 60, 70, 80\\}$. The sample size is $n=8$. The data are already sorted in ascending order.\n\n*   **Sample Median**: For an even sample size $n$, the median is the arithmetic mean of the two central values, which are the $(n/2)$-th and $(n/2 + 1)$-th observations.\n    Here, $n=8$, so we need the $4$-th and $5$-th values.\n    $x_4 = 5$\n    $x_5 = 50$\n    The sample median, denoted $m$, is:\n    $$m = \\frac{x_4 + x_5}{2} = \\frac{5 + 50}{2} = \\frac{55}{2} = 27.5$$\n\n*   **Sample Geometric Mean**: The geometric mean ($GM$) of a set of $n$ positive numbers $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$ is the $n$-th root of their product.\n    $$GM = \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i\\right)^{1/n}$$\n    For the given data:\n    $$GM = (2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 50 \\times 60 \\times 70 \\times 80)^{1/8}$$\n    The product is $2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 50 \\times 60 \\times 70 \\times 80 = 2,016,000,000$.\n    $$GM = (2,016,000,000)^{1/8}$$\n    This calculation is more conveniently performed using logarithms. The logarithm of the geometric mean is the arithmetic mean of the logarithms of the values:\n    $$\\ln(GM) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln(x_i)$$\n    $$\\ln(GM) = \\frac{\\ln(2) + \\ln(3) + \\ln(4) + \\ln(5) + \\ln(50) + \\ln(60) + \\ln(70) + \\ln(80)}{8}$$\n    Using approximate values:\n    $$\\ln(GM) \\approx \\frac{0.693 + 1.099 + 1.386 + 1.609 + 3.912 + 4.094 + 4.248 + 4.382}{8} = \\frac{21.423}{8} \\approx 2.678$$\n    Therefore, the geometric mean is:\n    $$GM = e^{\\ln(GM)} \\approx e^{2.678} \\approx 14.556$$\n\nSo, the sample median is $27.5$ and the sample geometric mean is approximately $14.56$.\n\n**2. Justification of the Preferred Summary**\n\nThe problem asks us to choose a summary statistic $t$ that is optimal under the loss function $L(t,X) = (\\ln X - \\ln t)^2$. In statistical decision theory, the optimal choice is the one that minimizes the expected loss, or risk, $R(t) = E[L(t,X)]$.\n$$R(t) = E[(\\ln X - \\ln t)^2]$$\nLet $Y = \\ln X$. The problem states that $X$ is Log-Normally distributed, so $Y$ is Normally distributed. Let the mean and variance of $Y$ be $\\mu_Y = E[Y]$ and $\\sigma_Y^2 = \\text{Var}(Y)$, respectively. The risk function can be rewritten in terms of $Y$ and a constant $c = \\ln t$:\n$$R(c) = E[(Y - c)^2]$$\nThis is the mean squared error for estimating the random variable $Y$ with a constant $c$. It is a fundamental result in statistics that this expression is minimized when $c = E[Y]$.\nTo show this, we can expand the expression and differentiate:\n$R(c) = E[Y^2 - 2cY + c^2] = E[Y^2] - 2cE[Y] + c^2$.\n$\\frac{dR}{dc} = -2E[Y] + 2c$. Setting the derivative to zero gives $c = E[Y]$.\nSince $c = \\ln t$, the optimal population summary statistic $t$ must satisfy $\\ln t = E[Y] = E[\\ln X]$. This implies the optimal summary is $t_{opt} = e^{E[\\ln X]}$. This quantity is, by definition, the **population geometric mean**.\n\nNow, let's consider the properties of the Log-Normal distribution. If $X \\sim \\text{Log-Normal}(\\mu_Y, \\sigma_Y^2)$, then:\n- The median of the distribution of $X$ is $e^{\\mu_Y}$.\n- The geometric mean of the distribution of $X$ is $e^{E[\\ln X]} = e^{\\mu_Y}$.\nTherefore, for a Log-Normal distribution, the population median and the population geometric mean are identical. The task is to find the best *sample* statistic to estimate this common population parameter, $e^{\\mu_Y}$.\n\nWe are estimating $e^{\\mu_Y}$ from a sample $x_1, \\dots, x_n$. This is equivalent to estimating $e^{\\mu_Y}$ from the log-transformed sample $y_1, \\dots, y_n$ where $y_i = \\ln x_i$ and $Y_i \\sim N(\\mu_Y, \\sigma_Y^2)$.\n- The **sample geometric mean** of the $x_i$ is $GM = (\\prod x_i)^{1/n} = e^{(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum \\ln x_i)} = e^{\\bar{y}}$.\n- The sample mean $\\bar{y}$ is the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the mean $\\mu_Y$ of a normal distribution. By the invariance property of MLEs, $e^{\\bar{y}}$ (the sample geometric mean) is the MLE for $e^{\\mu_Y}$. The sample mean $\\bar{y}$ is also the most efficient unbiased estimator of $\\mu_Y$.\n\n- The **sample median** of $x$ is another estimator for the population median $e^{\\mu_Y}$. However, for a normal distribution (the $y_i$), the sample mean $\\bar{y}$ is a more efficient estimator of the population mean $\\mu_Y$ than the sample median of the $y_i$. The asymptotic variance of the sample mean is $\\sigma_Y^2/n$, while the asymptotic variance of the sample median is $(\\pi/2)(\\sigma_Y^2/n)$. Since $\\pi/2 > 1$, the sample mean is more efficient. This superior efficiency carries over when estimating $e^{\\mu_Y}$, meaning the sample geometric mean is asymptotically more efficient than the sample median under the Log-Normal assumption.\n\nIn summary, the sample geometric mean is the preferred estimator because it is the MLE for the parameter that minimizes the specified loss function, and it is a more efficient estimator than the sample median when the Log-Normal model holds.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The sample median should be preferred, because it minimizes expected squared error on the logarithmic scale and is less biased than the geometric mean for estimating the population median under a Log-Normal model.**\n- \"minimizes expected squared error on the logarithmic scale\": This is incorrect. The value $t$ that minimizes the *sample* sum of squared logarithmic errors, $\\sum_i (\\ln x_i - \\ln t)^2$, is the sample geometric mean, not the sample median.\n- \"is less biased\": The sample geometric mean $e^{\\bar{Y}}$ is a biased estimator of $e^{\\mu_Y}$, with $E[e^{\\bar{Y}}] = e^{\\mu_Y + \\sigma_Y^2/(2n)}$. The sample median is also generally biased for small samples from skewed distributions. There is no general theoretical basis to claim the sample median is less biased in this context. The primary justification for an estimator here stems from efficiency and the loss function, not small-sample bias properties.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The sample geometric mean should be preferred, because under a Log-Normal model it targets the same population quantity as the median, minimizes expected squared error on the logarithmic scale, and is the maximum likelihood estimator that is asymptotically more efficient than the sample median when the model is correct.**\n- \"targets the same population quantity as the median\": Correct. For a Log-Normal distribution, the population GM and population median are both $e^{\\mu_Y}$.\n- \"minimizes expected squared error on the logarithmic scale\": Correct. This statement correctly links the sample GM to the principle of minimizing the specified loss function. The sample GM is the empirical risk minimizer.\n- \"is the maximum likelihood estimator\": Correct. The sample GM is the MLE of $e^{\\mu_Y}$.\n- \"asymptotically more efficient than the sample median\": Correct. This follows from the superior efficiency of the sample mean over the sample median for a Normal distribution (on the log scale).\nAll claims in this option are accurate and provide a complete and correct justification.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The arithmetic mean should be preferred, because for a Log-Normal population it equals the population median and therefore minimizes squared error on the original scale.**\n- \"it equals the population median\": Incorrect. The population arithmetic mean of a Log-Normal distribution is $e^{\\mu_Y + \\sigma_Y^2/2}$, which is strictly greater than the population median $e^{\\mu_Y}$ for $\\sigma_Y^2 > 0$.\n- \"minimizes squared error on the original scale\": While the arithmetic mean does minimize the expected squared error on the original scale, $E[(X-t)^2]$, the problem explicitly specifies a loss function on the *logarithmic* scale. This justification is irrelevant to the stated goals.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The harmonic mean should be preferred, because it is invariant under logarithmic transformation and equals the Log-Normal population median.**\n- \"invariant under logarithmic transformation\": This claim is mathematically false. The harmonic mean does not possess such an invariance property.\n- \"equals the Log-Normal population median\": This is incorrect. The population harmonic mean has a different value, related to $e^{\\mu_Y - \\sigma_Y^2/2}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The sample geometric mean always equals the sample median for any dataset drawn from a Log-Normal distribution, so either is equally valid under the Log-Normal assumption.**\n- \"sample geometric mean always equals the sample median\": This is false. Our own calculations show the sample GM is $\\approx 14.56$ and the sample median is $27.5$. While their population counterparts are equal for a Log-Normal distribution, the sample estimators are almost never equal for a finite sample.\n- \"so either is equally valid\": This conclusion is based on a false premise. Furthermore, as established in the analysis for B, they are not equally valid from an efficiency standpoint; the geometric mean is preferred.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4965919"}, {"introduction": "After seeing how the geometric mean is a powerful summary for skewed data, it's natural to ask about its statistical properties.

The task requires deriving a standard result from first principles, which is a legitimate and well-defined mathematical exercise.\n\nThe problem asks for a three-part derivation concerning the sample geometric mean of a log-normally distributed random variable. Let $X$ be a random variable representing the biomarker concentration, such that $X \\sim \\mathrm{LogNormal}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$. This is defined to mean that the new random variable $Y = \\log X$ is normally distributed with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$, i.e., $Y \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$.

Using the properties of logarithms, specifically $\\log(a^b) = b \\log a$ and $\\log(ab) = \\log a + \\log b$:\n$$ \\log \\tilde{X} = \\log\\left(\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{n} X_{i}\\right)^{1/n}\\right) = \\frac{1}{n} \\log\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{n} X_{i}\\right) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\log X_i $$\nLet $Y_i = \\log X_i$ for $i=1, \\dots, n$. Since the $X_i$ are i.i.d., the $Y_i$ are also i.i.d. random variables. From Part 1, we know that each $Y_i$ is a draw from a normal distribution, $Y_i \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$.\n\nThe expression for $\\log \\tilde{X}$ is the sample mean of the $Y_i$:\n$$ \\log \\tilde{X} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i = \\bar{Y} $$\nWe now characterize the sampling distribution of $\\bar{Y}$. Since the $Y_i$ are i.i.d. normal random variables, their sum, $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i$, is also a normal random variable. The mean and variance of this sum are:\n$$ E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[Y_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mu = n\\mu $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathrm{Var}[Y_i] \\quad (\\text{due to independence}) \\quad = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sigma^2 = n\\sigma^2 $$\nThe sample mean $\\bar{Y}$ is $\\frac{1}{n}$ times this sum.

Thus, $\\bar{Y} = \\log \\tilde{X}$ is normally distributed with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2/n$. We write this as:\n$$ \\log \\tilde{X} \\sim N\\left(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\right) $$\nBy the definition of a log-normal distribution, if the logarithm of a variable is normally distributed, the variable itself is log-normally distributed.

For each hospital $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, we are given the number of deaths, $d_i$, and the number of observed cases, $n_i$. The study design specifies that surveillance in each hospital continued until a fixed number of deaths, $d$, was observed. Therefore, $d_1 = d_2 = d_3 = d = 5$. The observed numbers of cases are $n_1 = 80$, $n_2 = 200$, and $n_3 = 20$.\n\nThe unit-specific CFR for hospital $i$ is defined as the proportion $r_i = \\frac{d_i}{n_i}$.\nThe individual CFRs are:\nFor hospital 1: $r_1 = \\frac{d_1}{n_1} = \\frac{5}{80} = \\frac{1}{16} = 0.0625$.\nFor hospital 2: $r_2 = \\frac{d_2}{n_2} = \\frac{5}{200} = \\frac{1}{40} = 0.025$.\nFor hospital 3: $r_3 = \\frac{d_3}{n_3} = \\frac{5}{20} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$.\n\nThe problem states that the overall CFR, let us denote it $R_{overall}$, is implied by aggregating deaths and cases across all hospitals.

Let's express $R_{overall}$ in terms of the individual rates $r_i$.\n\nA general way to relate the overall proportion to the individual proportions is to recognize it as a weighted arithmetic mean. Since $d_i = n_i r_i$, we can substitute this into the numerator:\n$$R_{overall} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i r_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i}$$\nThis expression is the definition of a weighted arithmetic mean of the rates $r_i$, where the weight for each rate $r_i$ is its denominator, $n_i$ (the number of cases). This shows that the true overall proportion is always a weighted average of the individual proportions, with weights given by the sample size of each subgroup.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies a fixed-deaths design, where $d_i = d$ is a constant for all $i$. This special condition allows for an alternative and more specific interpretation. We can express the number of cases, $n_i$, in terms of the rate $r_i$ and the fixed number of deaths $d$: $n_i = \\frac{d_i}{r_i} = \\frac{d}{r_i}$. Substituting this into the denominator of the expression for $R_{overall}$:\n$$R_{overall} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} d}{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{d}{r_i}}$$\nSince $d$ is a constant, we can factor it out from both the numerator and the denominator:\n$$R_{overall} = \\frac{k \\cdot d}{d \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{r_i}} = \\frac{k}{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{r_i}}$$\nThis is the definition of the harmonic mean of the $k$ rates $\\{r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_k\\}$. Thus, for the specific case of a fixed-deaths (or more generally, a fixed-numerator) design, the correct overall proportion corresponds to the harmonic mean of the individual proportions.\n\nLet's compute the value of $R_{overall}$ using the aggregated data:\nTotal deaths: $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} d_i = 5 + 5 + 5 = 15$.\nTotal cases: $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} n_i = 80 + 200 + 20 = 300$.\n$$R_{overall} = \\frac{15}{300} = \\frac{1}{20} = 0.05$$\n\nNext, we are asked to consider the summary that would be obtained by using the unweighted arithmetic mean of the unit-specific CFRs. Let's denote this by $R_{arith}$.\n$$R_{arith} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} r_i = \\frac{r_1 + r_2 + r_3}{3}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values for the individual rates:\n$$R_{arith} = \\frac{0.0625 + 0.025 + 0.25}{3} = \\frac{0.3375}{3} = 0.1125$$\nThe unweighted arithmetic mean gives a substantially different, and incorrect, estimate of the overall CFR. This is because it gives equal importance to the CFR from hospital 3 ($r_3=0.25$), which was based on only $20$ cases, and the CFR from hospital 2 ($r_2=0.025$), which was based on $200$ cases. The correct summary, $R_{overall}$, appropriately weights the contribution of each hospital by its number of cases.\n\nThe final step is to compute the absolute bias incurred by using the unweighted arithmetic mean. The bias is the difference between the estimated value ($R_{arith}$) and the true value ($R_{overall}$).\n$$\\text{Bias} = R_{arith} - R_{overall}$$\n$$\\text{Bias} = 0.1125 - 0.05 = 0.0625$$\nThe absolute bias is the absolute value of this difference:\n$$\\text{Absolute Bias} = |0.1125 - 0.05| = |0.0625| = 0.0625$$\nThe problem asks for this value to be rounded to four significant figures. The number $0.0625$ has three significant figures ($6$, $2$, $5$). To express it with four significant figures, we append a zero.\n$$\\text{Absolute Bias} \\approx 0.06250$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.06250}$$", "id": "4965964"}]}
