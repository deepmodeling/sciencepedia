It is scientifically grounded in probability theory, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard problem in mathematical statistics without any factual unsoundness, ambiguity, or contradiction.\n\nThe objective is to find the mode of a Gamma distribution, which is the value of the random variable $x$ that maximizes the probability density function (PDF). The domain of the biomarker is given as positive, so we are seeking the maximum of $f(x;\\alpha,\\theta)$ for $x \\in (0, \\infty)$. The PDF is given by:\n$$\nf(x;\\alpha,\\theta)=\\frac{x^{\\alpha-1}\\exp(-x/\\theta)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\,\\theta^{\\alpha}}\n$$\nwhere the shape parameter $\\alpha > 0$ and the scale parameter $\\theta > 0$.\n\nTo find the maximum of $f(x;\\alpha,\\theta)$, it is often more convenient to find the maximum of its natural logarithm, $\\ln(f(x;\\alpha,\\theta))$, since the logarithm is a strictly increasing function. Maximizing $\\ln(f(x))$ will yield the same value of $x$ that maximizes $f(x)$. Let $L(x) = \\ln(f(x;\\alpha,\\theta))$.\n$$\nL(x) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{x^{\\alpha-1}\\exp(-x/\\theta)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\,\\theta^{\\alpha}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can expand this expression:\n$$\nL(x) = (\\alpha-1)\\ln(x) - \\frac{x}{\\theta} - \\ln(\\Gamma(\\alpha)) - \\alpha\\ln(\\theta)\n$$\nThe terms $-\\ln(\\Gamma(\\alpha)) - \\alpha\\ln(\\theta)$ are constants with respect to $x$. To find the value of $x$ that maximizes $L(x)$, we take the first derivative of $L(x)$ with respect to $x$ and set it to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left( (\\alpha-1)\\ln(x) - \\frac{x}{\\theta} - \\text{constant} \\right) = \\frac{\\alpha-1}{x} - \\frac{1}{\\theta}\n$$\nSetting the derivative equal to zero gives the location of any critical points in the domain $x>0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha-1}{x} - \\frac{1}{\\theta} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha-1}{x} = \\frac{1}{\\theta}\n$$\nIf $\\alpha-1 \\neq 0$, we can solve for $x$:\n$$\nx = \\theta(\\alpha-1)\n$$\nThis critical point is only physically meaningful if it lies within the domain of the distribution, which requires $x > 0$. Since $\\theta > 0$, this condition is met if and only if $\\alpha-1 > 0$, or $\\alpha > 1$.\n\nNow, we must determine if this critical point corresponds to a maximum, a minimum, or a saddle point. We use the second derivative test. The second derivative of $L(x)$ with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2L}{dx^2} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left( (\\alpha-1)x^{-1} - \\frac{1}{\\theta} \\right) = -(\\alpha-1)x^{-2} = -\\frac{\\alpha-1}{x^2}\n$$\nFor the critical point to be a local maximum, the second derivative evaluated at that point must be negative. Given that $x^2$ is always positive for $x > 0$, the sign of the second derivative is determined by the sign of $-(\\alpha-1)$.\nIf $\\alpha > 1$, then $\\alpha-1 > 0$, and $\\frac{d^2L}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\alpha-1}{x^2} < 0$.\nThis confirms that for $\\alpha > 1$, the function has a unique local maximum at $x = \\theta(\\alpha-1)$. Since this is the only critical point in the domain $(0, \\infty)$ and the function $f(x)$ approaches $0$ as $x \\to 0^+$ (since $\\alpha-1 > 0$) and as $x \\to \\infty$, this local maximum is the global maximum.\nTherefore, for $\\alpha > 1$, the mode of the distribution is $m = \\theta(\\alpha-1)$. The distribution is unimodal with its peak located in the interior of its support.\n\nNext, we must analyze the cases where $\\alpha \\leq 1$.\n\nCase 1: $\\alpha = 1$.\nIn this case, the first derivative of the log-PDF is:\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{dx} = \\frac{1-1}{x} - \\frac{1}{\\theta} = -\\frac{1}{\\theta}\n$$\nSince $\\theta > 0$, the derivative $\\frac{dL}{dx}$ is a negative constant for all $x > 0$. This implies that the function $L(x)$ (and thus $f(x)$) is strictly decreasing over its entire domain $(0, \\infty)$. For a function that is strictly decreasing on $(0, \\infty)$, the maximum value is approached as $x$ approaches the left boundary of the domain, $x \\to 0^+$. Thus, the mode is located at $x=0$. In this case, the Gamma distribution simplifies to the Exponential distribution, which is known to have its mode at $x=0$.\n\nCase 2: $0 < \\alpha < 1$.\nIn this case, the term $\\alpha-1$ is negative. The first derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{dx} = \\frac{\\alpha-1}{x} - \\frac{1}{\\theta}\n$$\nSince $\\alpha-1 < 0$, $x > 0$, and $\\theta > 0$, both terms $\\frac{\\alpha-1}{x}$ and $-\\frac{1}{\\theta}$ are negative. Their sum is therefore always negative for all $x \\in (0, \\infty)$.\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{dx} < 0 \\quad \\text{for all } x>0\n$$\nAs in the case where $\\alpha=1$, the function $f(x)$ is strictly decreasing over its entire domain. The maximum is again approached as $x \\to 0^+$. The mode is therefore located at $x=0$. In this regime, the PDF has a vertical asymptote at $x=0$, as $x^{\\alpha-1} \\to \\infty$ when $x \\to 0^+$ for $\\alpha < 1$.\n\nIn summary, we can classify the modality based on the value of $\\alpha$:\n- If $\\alpha > 1$, the distribution is unimodal with a unique mode at $m = \\theta(\\alpha-1)$. The PDF starts at $0$, rises to a peak, and then decays.\n- If $0 < \\alpha \\leq 1$, the PDF is strictly decreasing from its maximum value (or supremum) at $x=0$. The mode is at $m=0$. This includes the exponential distribution ($\\alpha=1$) and other J-shaped distributions.\n\nCombining these results, we can write the location of the mode, $m(\\alpha, \\theta)$, as a piecewise function of the parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\theta$:\n$$\nm(\\alpha, \\theta) = \\begin{cases} \\theta(\\alpha-1) & \\text{if } \\alpha > 1 \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } 0 < \\alpha \\leq 1 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis expression provides the complete solution as requested.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{cases}\n\\theta(\\alpha-1) & \\text{if } \\alpha > 1 \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } 0 < \\alpha \\leq 1\n\\end{cases}\n}\n$$", "id": "4909555"}, {"introduction": "Many outcomes in biostatistics are discrete counts, for which the negative binomial distribution is a versatile model.
