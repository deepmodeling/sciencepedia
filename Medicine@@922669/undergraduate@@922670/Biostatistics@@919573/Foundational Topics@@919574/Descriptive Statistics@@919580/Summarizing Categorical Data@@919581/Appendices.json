These are well-established and universally accepted principles.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is self-contained. All necessary data (sample size and category counts) are provided.

The sum of the counts $120 + 80 + 50 = 250$ matches the total sample size $n=250$, ensuring internal consistency. The problem is a standard application of statistical principles.\n\nVerdict: The problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three steps as requested by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we compute the normalized empirical proportions for each smoking status category. The empirical proportion for a category $i$, denoted $\\hat{p}_i$, is the ratio of the number of observations in that category, $n_i$, to the total sample size, $n$.\nGiven $n=250$, and the counts $n_{\\text{never}} = 120$, $n_{\\text{former}} = 80$, and $n_{\\text{current}} = 50$.\n\nThe empirical proportion of never smokers is:\n$$\n\\hat{p}_{\\text{never}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{never}}}{n} = \\frac{120}{250} = 0.48\n$$\nThe empirical proportion of former smokers is:\n$$\n\\hat{p}_{\\text{former}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{former}}}{n} = \\frac{80}{250} = 0.32\n$$\nThe empirical proportion of current smokers is:\n$$\n\\hat{p}_{\\text{current}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{current}}}{n} = \\frac{50}{250} = 0.20\n$$\nAs a consistency check, the proportions must sum to $1$:\n$$\n\\hat{p}_{\\text{never}} + \\hat{p}_{\\text{former}} + \\hat{p}_{\\text{current}} = 0.48 + 0.32 + 0.20 = 1.00\n$$\nThe check is successful.\n\nSecond, we compute the empirical entropy $H$ of the distribution. The Shannon entropy for a discrete probability distribution with $K$ categories, using the natural logarithm, is defined as:\n$$\nH = -\\sum_{i=1}^{K} p_i \\ln(p_i)\n$$\nThe units of $H$ are nats when the natural logarithm is used. For our empirical distribution with $K=3$ categories, the entropy is calculated using the computed empirical proportions:\n$$\nH = - \\left( \\hat{p}_{\\text{never}} \\ln(\\hat{p}_{\\text{never}}) + \\hat{p}_{\\text{former}} \\ln(\\hat{p}_{\\text{former}}) + \\hat{p}_{\\text{current}} \\ln(\\hat{p}_{\\text{current}}) \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values of the proportions:\n$$\nH = - \\left( 0.48 \\ln(0.48) + 0.32 \\ln(0.32) + 0.20 \\ln(0.20) \\right)\n$$\nWe compute the value of each term:\n$$\n\\ln(0.48) \\approx -0.73396919\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(0.32) \\approx -1.13943428\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(0.20) \\approx -1.60943791\n$$\nNow, we compute the products:\n$$\n0.48 \\ln(0.48) \\approx 0.48 \\times (-0.73396919) \\approx -0.35230521\n$$\n$$\n0.32 \\ln(0.32) \\approx 0.32 \\times (-1.13943428) \\approx -0.36461897\n$$\n$$\n0.20 \\ln(0.20) \\approx 0.20 \\times (-1.60943791) \\approx -0.32188758\n$$\nSumming these products:\n$$\n\\sum_{i} \\hat{p}_i \\ln(\\hat{p}_i) \\approx -0.35230521 - 0.36461897 - 0.32188758 = -1.03881176\n$$\nFinally, we compute $H$ by negating this sum:\n$$\nH = -(-1.03881176) \\approx 1.03881176 \\, \\text{nats}\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the result to four significant figures.\n$$\nH \\approx 1.039 \\, \\text{nats}\n$$\n\nThird, we interpret the degree of heterogeneity. Entropy quantifies the uncertainty or, in this context, the heterogeneity of a distribution. A value of $H=0$ corresponds to perfect homogeneity, where all observations fall into a single category. The maximum possible entropy, $H_{\\text{max}}$, corresponds to maximum heterogeneity, which occurs when the distribution is uniform (i.e., all categories are equally likely).\n\nFor a distribution with $K=3$ categories, maximum entropy is achieved when $p_1 = p_2 = p_3 = 1/3$. The value of this maximum entropy is:\n$$\nH_{\\text{max}} = -\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\frac{1}{3} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = -3 \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\right) = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\ln(3)\n$$\nThe numerical value of the maximum entropy is:\n$$\nH_{\\text{max}} = \\ln(3) \\approx 1.09861 \\, \\text{nats}\n$$\nThe computed empirical entropy is $H \\approx 1.039$ nats. This value is quite close to the maximum possible entropy of $H_{\\text{max}} \\approx 1.099$ nats. The ratio of the observed entropy to the maximum possible entropy is $\\frac{1.039}{1.0986} \\approx 0.946$. This means the observed distribution exhibits approximately $94.6\\%$ of the maximum possible heterogeneity for three categories. Therefore, the smoking statuses in the sample are highly heterogeneous, indicating that the individuals are spread out quite evenly across the three categories, rather than being concentrated in one or two.\nThe final numerical answer required is the value of $H$, rounded to four significant figures.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.039}\n$$", "id": "4955379"}, {"introduction": "When comparing categorical outcomes like mortality across different populations, crude rates can be misleading if the populations have different underlying structures, such as age distributions.

It is scientifically grounded in the established biostatistical method of direct standardization, is well-posed with all necessary data provided, and is expressed in objective, unambiguous language.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the directly standardized risk and then compute its value.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Directly Standardized Risk Formula**\n\nLet $E$ be the event of death within one year for a randomly selected individual. The risk of death is the probability of this event, $P(E)$.\nLet the population be partitioned into $k$ mutually exclusive and exhaustive strata, indexed by $s \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, k\\}$. In this problem, there are $k=4$ age strata.\nLet $S$ be a random variable representing the stratum of an individual. The event that an individual belongs to stratum $s$ is denoted as $\\{S=s\\}$.\n\nAccording to the law of total probability, the overall probability of event $E$ can be expressed as a sum over the conditioning events $\\{S=s\\}$:\n$$P(E) = \\sum_{s=1}^{k} P(E | S=s) P(S=s)$$\n\nIn this context:\n- $P(E | S=s)$ is the stratum-specific risk for stratum $s$, which we denote as $r_s$. This is the probability of death for an individual known to be in stratum $s$.\n- $P(S=s)$ is the proportion of the total population that belongs to stratum $s$.\n\nThe formula for the overall risk $R$ in any given population is thus a weighted average of the stratum-specific risks, where the weights are the proportions of the population in each stratum:\n$$R = \\sum_{s=1}^{k} r_s P(S=s)$$\n\nDirect standardization aims to compute the overall risk that would be observed in the study population if it had the age structure of a specified standard population. To do this, we combine the stratum-specific risks ($r_s$) from the *study population* with the stratum proportions from the *standard population*.\n\nThe problem provides the stratum weights from the standard population as $w_s$. These weights represent the proportions of the standard population in each stratum, so $w_s = P(S=s)$ for the standard population. By definition, $\\sum_{s=1}^{k} w_s = 1$.\n\nSubstituting $w_s$ for $P(S=s)$ in the general risk formula yields the expression for the directly standardized risk, $R_{std}$:\n$$R_{std} = \\sum_{s=1}^{k} r_s w_s$$\nFor this problem with $k=4$ strata, the formula is:\n$$R_{std} = \\sum_{s=1}^{4} r_s w_s = r_1 w_1 + r_2 w_2 + r_3 w_3 + r_4 w_4$$\n\n**2. Calculation of the Directly Standardized Risk**\n\nFirst, we must calculate the stratum-specific risks, $r_s$, from the study population data. The risk $r_s$ for stratum $s$ is the number of deaths, $D_s$, divided by the population size, $N_s$.\n\n- Stratum $1$: $r_1 = \\frac{D_1}{N_1} = \\frac{45}{40000} = 0.001125$\n- Stratum $2$: $r_2 = \\frac{D_2}{N_2} = \\frac{118}{20000} = 0.0059$\n- Stratum $3$: $r_3 = \\frac{D_3}{N_3} = \\frac{171}{8000} = 0.021375$\n- Stratum $4$: $r_4 = \\frac{D_4}{N_4} = \\frac{315}{4000} = 0.07875$\n\nThe standard population weights, $w_s$, are given:\n- $w_1 = 0.46$\n- $w_2 = 0.28$\n- $w_3 = 0.16$\n- $w_4 = 0.10$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the derived formula for $R_{std}$:\n$$R_{std} = (0.001125)(0.46) + (0.0059)(0.28) + (0.021375)(0.16) + (0.07875)(0.10)$$\n\nCalculate each term of the sum:\n- $r_1 w_1 = 0.0005175$\n- $r_2 w_2 = 0.001652$\n- $r_3 w_3 = 0.00342$\n- $r_4 w_4 = 0.007875$\n\nSumming these products gives the directly standardized risk:\n$$R_{std} = 0.0005175 + 0.001652 + 0.00342 + 0.007875 = 0.0134645$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to five significant figures. The first significant digit is $1$ in the hundredths place. The five significant figures are $1, 3, 4, 6, 4$.

Let's verify this.\nTotal subjects with $A=1$ is $(10+40)+(45+5) = 100$.\nTotal subjects with $A=0$ is $(5+45)+(40+10) = 100$.\nTotal subjects is $200$.\n$P(A=1) = 100/200 = 0.5$.\n$P(Z=0) = (50+50)/200 = 100/200 = 0.5$.\n$P(A=1, Z=0) = (10+40)/200 = 50/200 = 0.25$.\nSince $P(A=1, Z=0) = 0.25 = P(A=1)P(Z=0) = 0.5 \\times 0.5$, the independence condition $A \\perp Z$ holds.\n\nNow we compute the stratum-specific measures:\nRisk Differences:\n$\\mathrm{RD}(0) = p_{10} - p_{00} = 0.2 - 0.1 = 0.1$\n$\\mathrm{RD}(1) = p_{11} - p_{01} = 0.9 - 0.8 = 0.1$\nThus, $\\mathrm{RD}(0) = \\mathrm{RD}(1)$, confirming homogeneity.\n\nOdds Ratios:\n$\\mathrm{OR}(0) = \\frac{p_{10}/(1-p_{10})}{p_{00}/(1-p_{00})} = \\frac{0.2/0.8}{0.1/0.9} = \\frac{0.25}{1/9} = 2.25$\n$\\mathrm{OR}(1) = \\frac{p_{11}/(1-p_{11})}{p_{01}/(1-p_{01})} = \\frac{0.9/0.1}{0.8/0.2} = \\frac{9}{4} = 2.25$\nThus, $\\mathrm{OR}(0) = \\mathrm{OR}(1)$, confirming homogeneity.\n\nRisk Ratios:\n$\\mathrm{RR}(0) = \\frac{p_{10}}{p_{00}} = \\frac{0.2}{0.1} = 2$\n$\\mathrm{RR}(1) = \\frac{p_{11}}{p_{01}} = \\frac{0.9}{0.8} = 1.125$\nThus, $\\mathrm{RR}(0) \\neq \\mathrm{RR}(1)$, confirming non-homogeneity.\n\nAll claims in the problem statement are verified.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of the Marginal Odds Ratio**\n\nTo compute $\\mathrm{OR}_{\\mathrm{marg}}$, we first construct the marginal $2 \\times 2$ table by summing counts across the strata of $Z$.\n- Count for ($A=1, Y=1$): $10+45 = 55$\n- Count for ($A=1, Y=0$): $40+5 = 45$\n- Count for ($A=0, Y=1$): $5+40 = 45$\n- Count for ($A=0, Y=0$): $45+10 = 55$\n\nThe marginal table is:\n|         | $Y=1$ | $Y=0$ |\n|---------|-------|-------|\n| $A=1$   | $55$    | $45$    |\n| $A=0$   | $45$    | $55$    |\n\nThe marginal odds ratio is calculated from this table:\n$$\\mathrm{OR}_{\\mathrm{marg}} = \\frac{\\text{Count}(A=1, Y=1) \\times \\text{Count}(A=0, Y=0)}{\\text{Count}(A=1, Y=0) \\times \\text{Count}(A=0, Y=1)} = \\frac{55 \\times 55}{45 \\times 45}$$\n$$\\mathrm{OR}_{\\mathrm{marg}} = \\left(\\frac{55}{45}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{11}{9}\\right)^2 = \\frac{121}{81}$$\nNumerically, this value is:\n$$\\mathrm{OR}_{\\mathrm{marg}} = \\frac{121}{81} \\approx 1.493827...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $1.494$.\nThis result demonstrates the non-collapsibility of the odds ratio. Despite the stratum-specific OR being constant at $2.25$ and the absence of confounding ($A \\perp Z$), the marginal OR is $1.494$, a value different from the common stratum-specific OR.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.494}$$", "id": "4955402"}]}
