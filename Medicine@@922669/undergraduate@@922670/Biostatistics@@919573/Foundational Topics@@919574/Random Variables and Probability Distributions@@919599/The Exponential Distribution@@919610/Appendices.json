This is a conditional expectation problem. Let $t_0 = 7.8$ years. We need to calculate the expected value of the remaining lifetime, $T - t_0$, given that the atom has survived past time $t_0$, i.e., $T  t_0$. The quantity we need to find is $E[T - t_0 | T  t_0]$.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to use the memoryless property of the exponential distribution. The memoryless property states that for any $s  0$ and $t  0$:\n$$P(T  s + t | T  s) = P(T  t)$$\nIn words, the probability that the atom survives for an additional time $t$, given that it has already survived for time $s$, is the same as the probability that a brand new atom survives for time $t$. The distribution \"forgets\" how long the atom has already existed.\n\nThis property has a direct consequence for conditional expectation. The distribution of the remaining lifetime, $T - s$, given that $T  s$, is the same as the original distribution of $T$. Therefore, the expected remaining lifetime is equal to the original unconditional expected lifetime.\n$$E[T - s | T  s] = E[T]$$\n\nIn our problem, the time already survived is $s = t_0 = 7.8$ years. The original mean lifetime is $E[T] = 12.3$ years. Applying the memoryless property:\n$$E[T - 7.8 | T  7.8] = E[T]$$\nSince $E[T] = 12.3$ years, the expected remaining lifetime is 12.3 years.\n\nThe information that the atom has already survived for 7.8 years does not change its expected future lifetime.
