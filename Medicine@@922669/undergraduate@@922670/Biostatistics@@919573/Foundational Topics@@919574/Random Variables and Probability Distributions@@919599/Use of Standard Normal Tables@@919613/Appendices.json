Express your answer as a decimal with no percentage sign.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a general algorithm to compute the probability $P(a  X  b)$ for a normally distributed random variable $X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, followed by the application of this algorithm to a specific case. The derivation must originate from fundamental principles and account for the constraints of a standard normal table that provides cumulative probabilities only for non-negative values.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the General Algorithm**\n\nLet $X$ be a continuous random variable representing adult diastolic blood pressure, with $X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$. We wish to compute $P(a  X  b)$ for some constants $a$ and $b$.\n\nFirst, we address the ordering of the interval bounds $a$ and $b$. The probability is defined over an interval. If $a \\ge b$, the interval $(a, b)$ is empty or a single point. For a continuous random variable, the probability of the variable taking any single value is $0$. Therefore, if $a \\ge b$, then $P(a  X  b) = 0$. For a meaningful interval, we must have $a  b$. We will proceed assuming $a  b$.\n\nThe probability $P(a  X  b)$ can be expressed in terms of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of $X$, denoted by $F_X(x) = P(X \\le x)$. For any continuous random variable, the probability over an interval $(a, b]$ is given by $F_X(b) - F_X(a)$. Since the probability of $X$ equaling a single point is $0$, we have $P(a  X  b) = P(a  X \\le b) = P(X \\le b) - P(X \\le a)$.\n$$P(a  X  b) = F_X(b) - F_X(a)$$\n\nThe problem requires the use of a standard normal table. To use such a table, we must transform the random variable $X$ into a standard normal random variable $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$. This process is called standardization. We define the transformation:\n$$Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}$$\nIt is a fundamental property of normal distributions that any affine transformation of a normal random variable is also normal. Specifically, if $X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, then the variable $Z$ defined above follows the standard normal distribution, $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$.\n\nWe can now express the events $\\{X \\le b\\}$ and $\\{X \\le a\\}$ in terms of $Z$.\nThe inequality $X \\le x$ is equivalent to $X - \\mu \\le x - \\mu$, which, assuming $\\sigma  0$ (a standard deviation is always non-negative, and $\\sigma=0$ would imply a constant, not a random variable), is equivalent to $\\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\le \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}$.\nThus, $P(X \\le x) = P\\left(Z \\le \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)$.\n\nLet the CDF of the standard normal random variable $Z$ be denoted by $\\Phi(z) = P(Z \\le z)$. We have:\n$$F_X(x) = P(X \\le x) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)$$\n\nApplying this to our expression for $P(a  X  b)$:\n$$P(a  X  b) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{b - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{a - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)$$\nLet us define the standardized bounds as $z_b = \\frac{b - \\mu}{\\sigma}$ and $z_a = \\frac{a - \\mu}{\\sigma}$. Then the probability is:\n$$P(a  X  b) = \\Phi(z_b) - \\Phi(z_a)$$\n\nThe problem states that the available table only provides values for $\\Phi(z)$ where $z \\ge 0$. This presents a challenge if $z_a$ or $z_b$ is negative. We must derive a way to handle negative arguments. The standard normal distribution is symmetric about its mean of $0$. Its probability density function (PDF), $\\phi(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp(-z^2/2)$, satisfies $\\phi(z) = \\phi(-z)$.\n\nLet's find an expression for $\\Phi(-z)$ for some $z  0$.\nBy definition, $\\Phi(-z) = P(Z \\le -z)$. Due to the symmetry of the PDF, the area under the curve to the left of $-z$ is equal to the area under the curve to the right of $z$.\n$$P(Z \\le -z) = P(Z \\ge z)$$\nThe total area under the PDF is $1$. Therefore, the probability of being greater than or equal to $z$ is $1$ minus the probability of being less than $z$.\n$$P(Z \\ge z) = 1 - P(Z  z)$$\nFor a continuous distribution, $P(Z  z) = P(Z \\le z) = \\Phi(z)$.\nCombining these facts, we arrive at the crucial identity for negative arguments:\n$$\\Phi(-z) = 1 - \\Phi(z) \\quad \\text{for } z  0$$\nThis identity allows us to find the CDF value for any negative number using a table that only lists values for non-negative numbers.\n\nWe can now formulate a complete, step-by-step algorithm:\n\n**Algorithm to Compute $P(a  X  b)$**\n\n1.  **Validate Bounds**: Compare $a$ and $b$. If $a \\ge b$, the probability is $0$. Otherwise, proceed.\n2.  **Standardize**: Compute the standardized z-scores for the bounds $a$ and $b$ using the given population parameters $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$:\n    $$z_a = \\frac{a - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad z_b = \\frac{b - \\mu}{\\sigma}$$\n3.  **Express Probability**: The desired probability is $P(a  X  b) = \\Phi(z_b) - \\Phi(z_a)$.\n4.  **Table Lookup**: For each z-score, find the corresponding $\\Phi(z)$ value.\n    - If $z \\ge 0$, look up $\\Phi(z)$ directly from the standard normal table.\n    - If $z  0$, let $z = -z'$ where $z'  0$. Use the symmetry property: $\\Phi(z) = \\Phi(-z') = 1 - \\Phi(z')$. Find $\\Phi(z')$ from the table and compute the result.\n5.  **Calculate Final Probability**: Substitute the numerical values of $\\Phi(z_b)$ and $\\Phi(z_a)$ into the expression from Step 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\n**Part 2: Application of the Algorithm**\n\nWe are asked to compute $P(68  X  95)$ for a population where diastolic blood pressure $X$ is modeled as $N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ with $\\mu = 80$ and $\\sigma = 12$.\n\nLet's apply the algorithm derived above.\n1.  **Validate Bounds**: The lower bound is $a=68$ and the upper bound is $b=95$. Since $68  95$, the condition $ab$ is met.\n2.  **Standardize**: We compute $z_a$ and $z_b$.\n    $$z_a = \\frac{68 - 80}{12} = \\frac{-12}{12} = -1.00$$\n    $$z_b = \\frac{95 - 80}{12} = \\frac{15}{12} = 1.25$$\n3.  **Express Probability**: The probability is given by:\n    $$P(68  X  95) = \\Phi(1.25) - \\Phi(-1.00)$$\n4.  **Table Lookup**: We now find the values for $\\Phi(1.25)$ and $\\Phi(-1.00)$.\n    - For $z_b = 1.25$: This is a positive value. A standard normal table provides $\\Phi(1.25) \\approx 0.89435$.\n    - For $z_a = -1.00$: This is a negative value. We use the symmetry property derived in Part 1.\n      $$\\Phi(-1.00) = 1 - \\Phi(1.00)$$\n      From a standard normal table, $\\Phi(1.00) \\approx 0.84134$.\n      Therefore, $\\Phi(-1.00) \\approx 1 - 0.84134 = 0.15866$.\n5.  **Calculate Final Probability**: Substitute the looked-up values back into the expression:\n    $$P(68  X  95) \\approx 0.89435 - 0.15866 = 0.73569$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$0.73569 \\approx 0.7357$$\nThus, the probability that a randomly selected individual from this population has a diastolic blood pressure between $68$ mmHg and $95$ mmHg is approximately $0.7357$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7357}$$", "id": "4964786"}, {"introduction": "Beyond describing continuous measurements, the normal distribution is a powerful tool for approximating other distributions, like the binomial, thanks to the Central Limit Theorem.
