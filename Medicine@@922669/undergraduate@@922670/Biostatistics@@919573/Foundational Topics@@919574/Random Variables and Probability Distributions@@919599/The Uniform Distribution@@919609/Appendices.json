After being cut, the two resulting pieces are sorted into a 'short' pile and a 'long' pile. In the case of an exactly centered cut, the assignment of either piece to the 'short' or 'long' category is arbitrary. A key performance metric for understanding the process variability is the expected value of the ratio of the length of the shorter piece to the length of the longer piece. Calculate this value as a closed-form analytic expression.", "solution": "Let the length of the rod be $L$. The position of the cut, $X$, is a random variable that follows a uniform distribution on the interval $[0, L]$.

We can express $S$ and $G$ in terms of $X$ as:\n$S = \\min(X, L-X)$\n$G = \\max(X, L-X)$\n\nWe are asked to find the expected value of the ratio of the length of the shorter piece to the length of the longer piece, which is $E\\left[\\frac{S}{G}\\right]$.\nLet's first express the ratio $\\frac{S}{G}$ in terms of $X$:\n$$ \\frac{S}{G} = \\frac{\\min(X, L-X)}{\\max(X, L-X)} $$\nTo simplify the problem, let's define a normalized random variable $Y = \\frac{X}{L}$. Since $X \\sim U(0, L)$, the normalized variable $Y$ will follow a uniform distribution on the interval $[0, 1]$, i.e., $Y \\sim U(0, 1)$, with a PDF $f_Y(y) = 1$ for $y \\in [0, 1]$.\nWe can rewrite the ratio in terms of $Y$:\n$$ \\frac{S}{G} = \\frac{\\min(L Y, L - L Y)}{\\max(L Y, L - L Y)} = \\frac{L \\min(Y, 1-Y)}{L \\max(Y, 1-Y)} = \\frac{\\min(Y, 1-Y)}{\\max(Y, 1-Y)} $$\nThe ratio is independent of the total length $L$.

We can use algebraic manipulation:\n$$ \\frac{x}{1-x} = \\frac{-(1-x) + 1}{1-x} = -1 + \\frac{1}{1-x} $$\nSo, the integral becomes:\n$$ I_1 = \\int_0^{1/2} \\left(-1 + \\frac{1}{1-x}\\right) dx = \\left[-x - \\ln|1-x|\\right]_0^{1/2} $$\n$$ I_1 = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} - \\ln\\left|1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right|\\right) - (-0 - \\ln|1-0|) = -\\frac{1}{2} - \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2} - (-\\ln(2)) = \\ln(2) - \\frac{1}{2} $$\nNow let's evaluate the second integral, $I_2 = \\int_{1/2}^1 \\frac{1-x}{x} dx$. We can use a substitution $u = 1-x$. Then $x = 1-u$ and $dx = -du$. The limits of integration change as follows: when $x=1/2$, $u=1/2$; when $x=1$, $u=0$.\n$$ I_2 = \\int_{1/2}^0 \\frac{u}{1-u} (-du) = \\int_0^{1/2} \\frac{u}{1-u} du $$\nThis is exactly the same integral as $I_1$.
