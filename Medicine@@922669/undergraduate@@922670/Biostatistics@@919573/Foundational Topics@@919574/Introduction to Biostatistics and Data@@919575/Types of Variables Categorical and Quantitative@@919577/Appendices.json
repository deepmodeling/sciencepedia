Consider the following two settings.\n\nNominal-nominal setting: Twelve specimens are each classified by pathogen species and sample site. Pathogen species is nominal with three categories $\\{\\text{S1}, \\text{S2}, \\text{S3}\\}$. Sample site is nominal with two categories $\\{\\text{Nasal}, \\text{Throat}\\}$. The observed pairs $(\\text{Species}, \\text{Site})$ for subjects $i=1,\\dots,12$ are:\n$(\\text{S3}, \\text{Throat})$, $(\\text{S3}, \\text{Throat})$, $(\\text{S3}, \\text{Throat})$, $(\\text{S3}, \\text{Throat})$, $(\\text{S2}, \\text{Throat})$, $(\\text{S2}, \\text{Throat})$, $(\\text{S3}, \\text{Nasal})$, $(\\text{S2}, \\text{Nasal})$, $(\\text{S2}, \\text{Nasal})$, $(\\text{S1}, \\text{Nasal})$, $(\\text{S1}, \\text{Nasal})$, $(\\text{S1}, \\text{Nasal})$.\nDefine binary site coding $\\text{Nasal} \\mapsto 0$, $\\text{Throat} \\mapsto 1$. Now define two different arbitrary species codings: Coding A maps $\\text{S1} \\mapsto 0$, $\\text{S2} \\mapsto 1$, $\\text{S3} \\mapsto 2$.

Round your final answer to four significant figures and express it as a unitless scalar.", "solution": "This problem requires the computation and interpretation of two different measures of association, Pearson's correlation coefficient and Kendall's tau, in two distinct data settings: nominal-nominal and ordinal-ordinal. The core of the problem is to explain why the choice of association measure must be appropriate for the type of variables involved.\n\nFirst, we define the variable types. A **nominal variable** consists of categories that are unordered. For example, pathogen species $\\{\\text{S1}, \\text{S2}, \\text{S3}\\}$ are distinct categories, but there is no inherent ranking or magnitude associated with them. A numerical coding is arbitrary. An **ordinal variable** consists of categories that have a meaningful order or rank, but the magnitude of the difference between ranks is not specified or necessarily equal. For example, a disease severity rank of $1$ is less severe than a rank of $2$, but the difference in severity between ranks $1$ and $2$ is not necessarily the same as between ranks $2$ and $3$. A **quantitative (or scale) variable** has a meaningful order, and the differences between values are meaningful and consistent (e.g., temperature in Kelvin).\n\n**Part 1: Nominal-Nominal Setting and Pearson's Correlation**\n\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient, $r$, measures the strength and direction of a *linear* relationship between two *quantitative* variables. Its formula is:\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}} = \\frac{n \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i - (\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i)(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i)}{\\sqrt{[n \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 - (\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i)^2][n \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i^2 - (\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i)^2]}}\n$$\nThis formula relies on the numerical values of $x$ and $y$, their means, and their deviations. To apply it to nominal data, we must first assign numerical codes, as specified in the problem. The sample size is $n=12$.\n\nLet the variable for species be $X$ and for site be $Y$. The site coding is fixed: $\\text{Nasal}=0$, $\\text{Throat}=1$. The $n=12$ data pairs are:\n$(\\text{S3}, \\text{Throat}) \\times 4$, $(\\text{S2}, \\text{Throat}) \\times 2$, $(\\text{S3}, \\text{Nasal}) \\times 1$, $(\\text{S2}, \\text{Nasal}) \\times 2$, $(\\text{S1}, \\text{Nasal}) \\times 3$.\n\n**Calculation for Coding A:**\nSpecies coding: $\\text{S1} \\mapsto 0$, $\\text{S2} \\mapsto 1$, $\\text{S3} \\mapsto 2$. Site coding: $\\text{Nasal} \\mapsto 0$, $\\text{Throat} \\mapsto 1$.\nThe numerical data pairs $(x_{A,i}, y_i)$ are:\n$(2, 1) \\times 4$, $(1, 1) \\times 2$, $(2, 0) \\times 1$, $(1, 0) \\times 2$, $(0, 0) \\times 3$.\nWe compute the necessary sums:\n$\\sum x_A = 4(2) + 2(1) + 1(2) + 2(1) + 3(0) = 8 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 14$.\n$\\sum y = 4(1) + 2(1) + 1(0) + 2(0) + 3(0) = 4 + 2 = 6$.\n$\\sum x_A^2 = 4(2^2) + 2(1^2) + 1(2^2) + 2(1^2) + 3(0^2) = 16 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 24$.\n$\\sum y^2 = 6(1^2) + 6(0^2) = 6$.\n$\\sum x_A y = 4(2 \\times 1) + 2(1 \\times 1) + 1(2 \\times 0) + 2(1 \\times 0) + 3(0 \\times 0) = 8 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 10$.\n\nUsing the formula for $r$ with $n=12$:\n$$\nr_A = \\frac{12(10) - (14)(6)}{\\sqrt{[12(24) - 14^2][12(6) - 6^2]}} = \\frac{120 - 84}{\\sqrt{[288 - 196][72 - 36]}} = \\frac{36}{\\sqrt{92 \\times 36}} = \\frac{36}{6\\sqrt{92}} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{92}} = \\frac{6}{2\\sqrt{23}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{23}}\n$$\n\n**Calculation for Coding B:**\nSpecies coding: $\\text{S1} \\mapsto 2$, $\\text{S2} \\mapsto 0$, $\\text{S3} \\mapsto 1$. Site coding is the same.\nThe numerical data pairs $(x_{B,i}, y_i)$ are:\n$(1, 1) \\times 4$, $(0, 1) \\times 2$, $(1, 0) \\times 1$, $(0, 0) \\times 2$, $(2, 0) \\times 3$.\nWe compute the necessary sums:\n$\\sum x_B = 4(1) + 2(0) + 1(1) + 2(0) + 3(2) = 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 6 = 11$.\n$\\sum y = 6$ (unchanged).\n$\\sum x_B^2 = 4(1^2) + 2(0^2) + 1(1^2) + 2(0^2) + 3(2^2) = 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 12 = 17$.\n$\\sum y^2 = 6$ (unchanged).\n$\\sum x_B y = 4(1 \\times 1) + 2(0 \\times 1) + 1(1 \\times 0) + 2(0 \\times 0) + 3(2 \\times 0) = 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4$.\n\nUsing the formula for $r$ with $n=12$:\n$$\nr_B = \\frac{12(4) - (11)(6)}{\\sqrt{[12(17) - 11^2][12(6) - 6^2]}} = \\frac{48 - 66}{\\sqrt{[204 - 121][72 - 36]}} = \\frac{-18}{\\sqrt{83 \\times 36}} = \\frac{-18}{6\\sqrt{83}} = \\frac{-3}{\\sqrt{83}}\n$$\n\n**Interpretation:**\nUnder Coding A, the Pearson correlation is $r_A = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{23}} \\approx 0.625$, suggesting a moderate positive linear association. Under Coding B, the correlation is $r_B = \\frac{-3}{\\sqrt{83}} \\approx -0.329$, suggesting a weak negative linear association. The fact that the correlation coefficient changes dramatically—even changing sign—based on a different but equally valid (i.e., arbitrary) numerical relabeling of the nominal categories demonstrates that Pearson's $r$ is not a meaningful measure of association for nominal variables. Its value is an artifact of the chosen coding scheme, not a reflection of any intrinsic relationship in the data. The concepts of \"linearity\" and \"direction\" are undefined for unordered categories. The proper measure for nominal-nominal association would be a chi-squared based measure like Cramer's V or the contingency coefficient, which are invariant to the ordering of rows or columns in a contingency table.\n\n**Part 2: Ordinal-Ordinal Setting and Kendall's Tau**\n\nKendall's rank correlation coefficient, $\\tau$, measures the strength of a *monotonic* association between two *ordinal* variables. It is based on the number of concordant and discordant pairs of observations. For a set of $n$ pairs $(x_i, y_i)$, we consider all unique pairs of observations $(x_i, y_i)$ and $(x_j, y_j)$.\n- A pair is **concordant** if the ranks for both variables are in the same direction: if $x_i < x_j$ and $y_i < y_j$, or if $x_i > x_j$ and $y_i > y_j$. This is equivalent to $(x_i - x_j)(y_i - y_j) > 0$.\n- A pair is **discordant** if the ranks are in opposite directions: if $x_i < x_j$ and $y_i > y_j$, or if $x_i > x_j$ and $y_i < y_j$. This is equivalent to $(x_i - x_j)(y_i - y_j) < 0$.\n(We assume no ties for this version of tau, which is the case here).\n\nThe formula is $\\tau = \\frac{N_c - N_d}{N_c + N_d}$, where $N_c$ is the number of concordant pairs and $N_d$ is the number of discordant pairs. The total number of pairs is $\\binom{n}{2} = N_c + N_d$.\n\nThe data provided is $X=(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)$ and $Y=(6,1,2,3,7,8,4,5)$, for $n=8$ patients. The pairs $(x_i, y_i)$ are $(1,6), (2,1), (3,2), (4,3), (5,7), (6,8), (7,4), (8,5)$.\nSince the $X$ variable is already sorted, for any pair of observations $i < j$, we will have $x_i < x_j$. A pair is concordant if $y_i < y_j$ and discordant if $y_i > y_j$.\n\nLet's count the number of concordant ($N_c$) and discordant ($N_d$) pairs:\n- For $(1,6)$: compared with $(2,1), (3,2), (4,3), (7,4), (8,5)$ it is discordant ($5$ pairs). Compared with $(5,7), (6,8)$ it is concordant ($2$ pairs).\n- For $(2,1)$: compared with $(3,2), (4,3), (5,7), (6,8), (7,4), (8,5)$ it is concordant ($6$ pairs). It is discordant with none.\n- For $(3,2)$: compared with $(4,3), (5,7), (6,8), (7,4), (8,5)$ it is concordant ($5$ pairs). It is discordant with none.\n- For $(4,3)$: compared with $(5,7), (6,8), (7,4), (8,5)$ it is concordant ($4$ pairs). It is discordant with none.\n- For $(5,7)$: compared with $(6,8)$ it is concordant ($1$ pair). Compared with $(7,4), (8,5)$ it is discordant ($2$ pairs).\n- For $(6,8)$: compared with $(7,4), (8,5)$ it is discordant ($2$ pairs). It is concordant with none.\n- For $(7,4)$: compared with $(8,5)$ it is concordant ($1$ pair).\n\nTotal concordant pairs $N_c = 2 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 19$.\nTotal discordant pairs $N_d = 5 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 9$.\nThe total number of pairs is $N_c + N_d = 19 + 9 = 28$, which correctly equals $\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2} = 28$.\n\nNow, we compute Kendall's tau:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{N_c - N_d}{N_c + N_d} = \\frac{19 - 9}{28} = \\frac{10}{28} = \\frac{5}{14}\n$$\nAs a decimal, $\\frac{5}{14} \\approx 0.3571428...$. Rounded to four significant figures, the value is $0.3571$.\n\n**Interpretation:**\nKendall's tau is a valid measure of association for ordinal data because it depends only on the *ordering* of the values, not their magnitudes. If we were to replace the ranks $(1, 2, ..., 8)$ with any other set of increasing numbers (a monotonic transformation), the concordance or discordance of each pair would remain unchanged, and thus the value of $\\tau$ would be the same. It correctly quantifies the degree to which the two ranked variables move in the same direction. A positive value, like $\\tau \\approx 0.3571$, indicates a tendency for higher ranks in disease severity to be associated with higher ranks in treatment adherence. This is a meaningful statistical conclusion for ordinal data, in direct contrast to the meaningless result from applying Pearson's $r$ to nominal data.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.3571}\n$$", "id": "4964383"}, {"introduction": "One of the most surprising and important phenomena in statistics is Simpson's Paradox, where a trend that appears in different groups of data disappears or even reverses when those groups are combined.

We use the laws of total variance and total covariance.\nThe group sizes are equal, $n_A = n_B = 100$, so the probability of a subject belonging to either clinic is $P(G=A) = P(G=B) = \\frac{100}{200} = 0.5$.\n\nThe law of total variance is $\\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(X \\mid G)] + \\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[X \\mid G])$.\n- The first term is the expectation of the within-clinic variance: $\\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(X \\mid G)] = \\mathbb{E}[1] = 1$.\n- The second term is the variance of the within-clinic means. The means of $X$ are $\\mathbb{E}[X \\mid G=A] = \\mu_X^A = 1$ and $\\mathbb{E}[X \\mid G=B] = \\mu_X^B = 9$.

This exercise puts you in the role of a health services researcher tasked with visualizing hospital performance data, a common scenario in biostatistics. By evaluating different graphical methods—from histograms and bar charts to more advanced scatter plots and stratified box plots—you will learn to select the most appropriate visualization based on the research question, the type of variables involved, and the inherent uncertainty in the data [@problem_id:4798462].", "problem": "A health services researcher compiles hospital-level data on central line-associated bloodstream infections across $I$ hospitals. For hospital $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,I\\}$, let $y_i$ denote the number of infections recorded during the surveillance period and $n_i$ denote the total patient-days observed. Hospitals vary substantially in size, with $n_i$ ranging from approximately $800$ to $90{,}000$ patient-days. The investigator forms hospital-level infection rates $r_i = 1000 \\times y_i / n_i$ (events per $1{,}000$ patient-days), which are ratio-scale quantities. The objective is to use graphical representation to understand the distribution of $r_i$ across hospitals, compare hospitals when appropriate, and communicate how variability in $n_i$ affects the stability of $r_i$.\n\nStarting from the foundational definitions of data types and graphical displays—namely that a histogram represents the empirical distribution of a single quantitative variable by binning its range, a bar chart represents values associated with discrete categories (often counts or summaries per category), a box plot summarises the distribution of a quantitative variable via median and quartiles, and a scatter plot represents ordered pairs $(x,y)$ to visualise relationships—determine which of the following statements are aligned with best practices for this scenario. Select all that apply.\n\nA. When the aim is to describe the overall distribution of hospital-level rates $r_i$ across many hospitals, a histogram of $r_i$ with appropriately chosen bin widths is preferred over a bar chart listing one bar per hospital, because $r_i$ is a single quantitative variable and the histogram conveys its empirical density; the varying denominators $n_i$ do not preclude using a histogram, but interpretation should be as the distribution across hospitals rather than an exposure-weighted view.\n\nB. Because $r_i$ is ratio-scale, a bar chart with one bar per hospital is the correct display; histograms are only for frequency counts of categorical variables and would misrepresent rates.\n\nC. If the goal is to communicate how variation in $n_i$ affects the stability of the estimated rates $r_i$, a scatter plot of $r_i$ versus $n_i$ is more informative than either a histogram or a bar chart, because it directly shows heteroscedasticity with respect to $n_i$ and can be annotated to reflect expected variability.\n\nD. When only a small subset of hospitals (e.g., $3$ to $5$) are of interest, a bar chart with a confidence interval (CI) for each $r_i$ is acceptable; however, for dozens of hospitals with widely varying $n_i$, the bar chart becomes misleading unless bars are scaled in width by $n_i$.\n\nE. To depict the distribution of exposure to different rate levels, use a histogram of $r_i$ weighted by $n_i$ (i.e., each hospital contributes weight proportional to its patient-days); this provides an exposure-weighted view that respects varying denominators, unlike an unweighted bar chart of hospitals.\n\nF. A box plot of $r_i$ over all hospitals effectively summarises central tendency and spread and is preferable to a bar chart listing hospitals when $I$ is large; if denominators vary widely, stratifying box plots by hospital size categories (e.g., small, medium, large by $n_i$) can aid interpretation without resorting to a bar chart.\n\nChoose all correct options.", "solution": "The core of the problem involves choosing appropriate graphical representations for a dataset containing hospital-level infection rates, $r_i$, where each rate is calculated from a number of events, $y_i$, and an exposure measure, $n_i$ (patient-days). The key features of the data are:\n1.  The rates, $r_i$, are a quantitative (ratio-scale) variable.\n2.  The hospitals, indexed by $i$, represent discrete categories.\n3.  The exposure, $n_i$, is a quantitative variable that varies widely and affects the precision of the corresponding rate estimate, $r_i$. Specifically, the variance of $r_i$ is expected to be inversely proportional to $n_i$.\n\nThe stated objectives are to understand the distribution of $r_i$, compare hospitals, and visualize the effect of varying $n_i$ on the stability of $r_i$. The foundational definitions of common plot types are provided. We will now evaluate each statement against these principles and objectives.\n\n**A. When the aim is to describe the overall distribution of hospital-level rates $r_i$ across many hospitals, a histogram of $r_i$ with appropriately chosen bin widths is preferred over a bar chart listing one bar per hospital, because $r_i$ is a single quantitative variable and the histogram conveys its empirical density; the varying denominators $n_i$ do not preclude using a histogram, but interpretation should be as the distribution across hospitals rather than an exposure-weighted view.**\n\nThis statement accurately describes the function of a histogram. The goal is to understand the distribution of a single quantitative variable, which is the set of rates $\\{r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_I\\}$. A histogram is the standard tool for this purpose, as it bins the range of the quantitative variable and displays the frequency of observations falling into each bin. A bar chart with one bar per hospital would be unreadable for large $I$ and would serve the different purpose of displaying individual values, not summarizing a distribution. The statement correctly points out that this unweighted histogram treats each hospital as a single observational unit, regardless of its size ($n_i$). This is a valid perspective—it shows the distribution of performance across the administrative units (hospitals).\n\n**Verdict: Correct.** The statement correctly identifies the purpose of a histogram for displaying the distribution of a quantitative variable and appropriately contrasts it with a bar chart, including the correct interpretational nuance regarding the unweighted nature of the analysis.\n\n**B. Because $r_i$ is ratio-scale, a bar chart with one bar per hospital is the correct display; histograms are only for frequency counts of categorical variables and would misrepresent rates.**\n\nThis statement fundamentally misrepresents the definitions of histograms and bar charts. Histograms are specifically designed for quantitative variables (like the ratio-scale $r_i$), binning their continuous or discrete-numeric range to show a frequency distribution. Bar charts are used to display values associated with discrete categories. The statement that histograms are for categorical variables is incorrect; that is the role of a bar chart (e.g., plotting frequencies of different categories).\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.** The statement reverses the roles of histograms and bar charts.\n\n**C. If the goal is to communicate how variation in $n_i$ affects the stability of the estimated rates $r_i$, a scatter plot of $r_i$ versus $n_i$ is more informative than either a histogram or a bar chart, because it directly shows heteroscedasticity with respect to $n_i$ and can be annotated to reflect expected variability.**\n\nThis statement correctly identifies the best tool for the specified goal. The stability (precision) of an estimated rate $r_i = 1000 \\times y_i / n_i$ is a function of its denominator $n_i$. Assuming the count $y_i$ follows a Poisson model, the variance of the rate estimate is approximately proportional to $1/n_i$. Plotting the relationship between two quantitative variables, $r_i$ and $n_i$, is the explicit purpose of a scatter plot. Such a plot will reveal heteroscedasticity: the vertical spread of $r_i$ values will be large for small $n_i$ and small for large $n_i$. This visualization, often called a \"funnel plot\" in this context, is the standard and most direct way to show how the estimate's stability depends on sample size. A histogram or bar chart cannot show this bivariate relationship.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.** The statement correctly identifies the scatter plot (funnel plot) as the superior tool for visualizing the relationship between rate stability and sample size.\n\n**D. When only a small subset of hospitals (e.g., $3$ to $5$) are of interest, a bar chart with a confidence interval (CI) for each $r_i$ is acceptable; however, for dozens of hospitals with widely varying $n_i$, the bar chart becomes misleading unless bars are scaled in width by $n_i$.**\n\nThe first part of the statement is reasonable: for comparing a very small number of categories, a bar chart is a common and acceptable, if not always optimal, choice. The addition of confidence intervals is a crucial improvement that incorporates uncertainty. However, the second part of the statement proposes a poor solution to a real problem. For dozens of hospitals, a bar chart indeed becomes misleading due to clutter and the false visual implication that all rates are estimated with equal precision. The proposed fix, scaling bar widths by $n_i$, is not a standard \"best practice.\" While it attempts to encode a second variable ($n_i$), variable-width bar charts can be difficult to interpret correctly, as people are better at judging length than area. Better and more standard alternatives for many entities include forest plots or Cleveland dot plots, which are more visually efficient and effective at showing values and their CIs. Because the statement presents a suboptimal and potentially confusing graphical method as a necessary condition (\"unless...\"), it is not aligned with best practices.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.** The statement identifies a real issue but proposes a solution (scaling bar width) that is not a recognized best practice and is generally inferior to other available methods like forest plots.\n\n**E. To depict the distribution of exposure to different rate levels, use a histogram of $r_i$ weighted by $n_i$ (i.e., each hospital contributes weight proportional to its patient-days); this provides an exposure-weighted view that respects varying denominators, unlike an unweighted bar chart of hospitals.**\n\nThis statement describes a valid and sophisticated analytical choice. An unweighted histogram (as in A) answers \"What is the distribution of rates across hospitals?\". A weighted histogram, where each hospital's rate $r_i$ is weighted by its size $n_i$, answers a different and equally important question: \"What is the distribution of rates experienced by the population of patient-days?\". This exposure-weighted perspective is crucial for understanding the overall quality of care from a patient's point of view, as a rate at a large hospital affects far more patient-days than the same rate at a small hospital. This is a standard technique in epidemiology and public health.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.** This statement accurately describes a valid statistical method (weighted histogram) and its correct interpretation (an exposure-weighted distribution), which is a best practice for answering a specific and relevant question with this type of data.\n\n**F. A box plot of $r_i$ over all hospitals effectively summarises central tendency and spread and is preferable to a bar chart listing hospitals when $I$ is large; if denominators vary widely, stratifying box plots by hospital size categories (e.g., small, medium, large by $n_i$) can aid interpretation without resorting to a bar chart.**\n\nThis statement describes two excellent applications of box plots. First, for a large number of observations of a quantitative variable ($r_i$ for many hospitals), a box plot is a compact and effective way to summarize the distribution's central tendency (median), spread (interquartile range), and identify potential outliers, making it far superior to a cluttered bar chart. Second, the statement addresses the issue of varying denominators ($n_i$) and the resulting heteroscedasticity. By stratifying the data into groups by hospital size (e.g., based on quantiles of $n_i$) and creating side-by-side box plots for each group, one can directly visualize how the distribution of rates (both its center and its spread) differs across hospital sizes. This is a powerful exploratory technique that helps disentangle true variation in performance from statistical noise due to sample size.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.** The statement proposes standard and highly effective uses of box plots for both summarizing a large dataset and for exploring the influence of a second variable (hospital size) on the distribution.\n\nBased on the analysis, statements A, C, E, and F are aligned with best practices for statistical graphics in this scenario.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACEF}$$", "id": "4798462"}]}
