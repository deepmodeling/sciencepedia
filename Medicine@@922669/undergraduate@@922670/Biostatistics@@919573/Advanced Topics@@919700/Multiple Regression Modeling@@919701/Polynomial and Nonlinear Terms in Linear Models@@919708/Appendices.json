The variance of this linear combination is given by the exact formula $\\mathrm{Var}(c^{\\top}\\hat{\\beta}) = c^{\\top}\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta})c$. The problem states to use the first-order multivariate delta method. For a linear function $g(\\beta) = c^{\\top}\\beta$, the gradient is $\\nabla g(\\beta) = c$. The delta method approximation for the variance is $(\\nabla g)^{\\top}\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta})(\\nabla g) = c^{\\top}\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta})c$, which is identical to the exact formula.\n\nLet $\\Sigma = \\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{\\beta})$ be the estimated covariance matrix provided in the problem statement:\n$$\n\\Sigma =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n9.00000 & -0.60000 & 0.06000 & -0.01200 \\\\\n-0.60000 & 0.07240 & -0.00940 & 0.00170 \\\\\n0.06000 & -0.00940 & 0.001444 & -0.000254 \\\\\n-0.01200 & 0.00170 & -0.000254 & 0.00004549\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe estimated variance of the marginal effect, $\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(g(\\hat{\\beta}))$, is computed by the quadratic form $c^{\\top}\\Sigma c$:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(g(\\hat{\\beta})) = c^{\\top}\\Sigma c =\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 & 0.75 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n9.00000 & -0.60000 & 0.06000 & -0.01200 \\\\\n-0.60000 & 0.07240 & -0.00940 & 0.00170 \\\\\n0.06000 & -0.00940 & 0.001444 & -0.000254 \\\\\n-0.01200 & 0.00170 & -0.000254 & 0.00004549\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0.75 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nExpanding the quadratic form, with $c_i$ being the components of $c$ and $\\Sigma_{ij}$ being the elements of $\\Sigma$:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(g(\\hat{\\beta})) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4}\\sum_{j=1}^{4} c_i c_j \\Sigma_{ij}\n$$\nSince $c_1 = 0$, we only need to consider terms where $i,j \\in \\{2, 3, 4\\}$:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(g(\\hat{\\beta})) = c_2^2\\Sigma_{22} + c_3^2\\Sigma_{33} + c_4^2\\Sigma_{44} + 2c_2c_3\\Sigma_{23} + 2c_2c_4\\Sigma_{24} + 2c_3c_4\\Sigma_{34}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values for $c_i$ and $\\Sigma_{ij}$:\n$$\nc_2 = 1, \\quad c_3 = 1, \\quad c_4 = 0.75\n$$\n$$\n\\Sigma_{22} = 0.07240, \\quad \\Sigma_{33} = 0.001444, \\quad \\Sigma_{44} = 0.00004549\n$$\n$$\n\\Sigma_{23} = -0.00940, \\quad \\Sigma_{24} = 0.00170, \\quad \\Sigma_{34} = -0.000254\n$$\nNow, we compute each term:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $c_2^2\\Sigma_{22} = (1)^2(0.07240) = 0.07240$\n    \\item $c_3^2\\Sigma_{33} = (1)^2(0.001444) = 0.001444$\n    \\item $c_4^2\\Sigma_{44} = (0.75)^2(0.00004549) = (0.5625)(0.00004549) = 0.000025588125$\n    \\item $2c_2c_3\\Sigma_{23} = 2(1)(1)(-0.00940) = -0.01880$\n    \\item $2c_2c_4\\Sigma_{24} = 2(1)(0.75)(0.00170) = 1.5(0.00170) = 0.00255$\n    \\item $2c_3c_4\\Sigma_{34} = 2(1)(0.75)(-0.000254) = 1.5(-0.000254) = -0.000381$\n\\end{itemize}\nSumming these values gives the variance:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(g(\\hat{\\beta})) = 0.07240 + 0.001444 + 0.000025588125 - 0.01880 + 0.00255 - 0.000381\n$$\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(g(\\hat{\\beta})) = 0.057238588125\n$$\nThe standard error (SE) is the square root of the variance:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SE}(g(\\hat{\\beta})) = \\sqrt{\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(g(\\hat{\\beta}))} = \\sqrt{0.057238588125} \\approx 0.23924587\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.
