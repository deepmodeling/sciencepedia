The observable data for each participant are the follow-up time $Y_{i}=\\min\\{T_{i},C_{i}\\}$ and the event indicator $\\delta_{i}=\\mathbf{1}\\{T_{i}\\leq C_{i}\\}$. In the Kaplan–Meier (KM) method for survival curve estimation, the risk set at an event time is formed by those individuals who are event-free and still under observation immediately prior to that time, and the number of events at that time is the count of individuals with events at that recorded time.

It asks for the determination of the risk set size and event count at a specific time point, based on a small dataset and the foundational definitions of the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method. All definitions, data, and conventions are standard, internally consistent, and sufficient to arrive at a unique, correct answer.\n\nThe problem provides data for a cohort of $N=4$ participants. For each participant $i$, we have an observation pair $(Y_i, \\delta_i)$, where $Y_i = \\min\\{T_i, C_i\\}$ is the observed follow-up time and $\\delta_i = \\mathbf{1}\\{T_i \\le C_i\\}$ is the event indicator. An event is indicated by $\\delta_i=1$, and right-censoring is indicated by $\\delta_i=0$.\n\nThe provided data are:\n*   Participant 1: $(Y_1, \\delta_1) = (3, 1)$\n*   Participant 2: $(Y_2, \\delta_2) = (3, 1)$\n*   Participant 3: $(Y_3, \\delta_3) = (3, 0)$\n*   Participant 4: $(Y_4, \\delta_4) = (5, 0)$\n\nThe problem asks for the risk set size $n_j$ and the number of events $d_j$ at the distinct event time $t_j=3$.\n\nFirst, we must identify the distinct event times. An event occurs at time $Y_i$ if the event indicator $\\delta_i$ is equal to $1$. Looking at the data, we have $\\delta_1=1$ at $Y_1=3$ and $\\delta_2=1$ at $Y_2=3$. The other two observations are censorings. Therefore, the only distinct event time in the dataset is $t_1=3$. The problem asks us to focus on this time, which we denote as $t_j=3$.\n\nNext, we determine the risk set size, $n_j$, at $t_j=3$. The risk set at an event time $t_j$, denoted $R(t_j)$, is defined as the set of all individuals who are still under observation and have not experienced an event just prior to $t_j$. In practice, this means we count all individuals $i$ whose observed follow-up time $Y_i$ is greater than or equal to $t_j$.\nMathematically, the size of the risk set at time $t_j$ is given by:\n$$n_j = |\\{i \\mid Y_i \\ge t_j\\}|$$\nFor $t_j=3$, we must count the number of participants for whom $Y_i \\ge 3$:\n*   Participant 1: $Y_1=3$. Since $3 \\ge 3$, this participant is in the risk set.\n*   Participant 2: $Y_2=3$. Since $3 \\ge 3$, this participant is in the risk set.\n*   Participant 3: $Y_3=3$. Since $3 \\ge 3$, this participant is in the risk set.\n*   Participant 4: $Y_4=5$. Since $5 \\ge 3$, this participant is in the risk set.\nAll four participants are in the risk set at time $t=3$. Therefore, the risk set size is $n_j = 4$.\n\nThe problem states a convention for handling ties: when events and censorings occur at the same recorded time, events are considered to occur just before censorings. Let us analyze the situation at time $t=3$. We have two events (participants 1 and 2) and one censoring (participant 3). The convention means that for the calculation of the KM estimator at $t=3$, we first form the risk set. Participant 3, who is censored at $t=3$, is still considered at risk at the moment the events at $t=3$ occur. This is because their censoring is treated as happening infinitesimally after the events. Our calculation of $n_j=4$ is consistent with this convention, as participant 3 is included in the risk set.\n\nFinally, we determine the number of events, $d_j$, at $t_j=3$. This is defined as the count of individuals who experience the event at exactly time $t_j$.\nMathematically, the number of events at time $t_j$ is given by:\n$$d_j = |\\{i \\mid Y_i = t_j \\text{ and } \\delta_i = 1\\}|$$\nFor $t_j=3$, we must count the number of participants for whom $Y_i=3$ and $\\delta_i=1$:\n*   Participant 1: $(Y_1, \\delta_1) = (3, 1)$. This participant had an event at $t=3$.\n*   Participant 2: $(Y_2, \\delta_2) = (3, 1)$. This participant had an event at $t=3$.\n*   Participant 3: $(Y_3, \\delta_3) = (3, 0)$. This participant was censored at $t=3$, not an event.\n*   Participant 4: $(Y_4, \\delta_4) = (5, 0)$. This participant's observed time is not $t=3$.\nTwo participants (1 and 2) experienced an event at time $t=3$. Therefore, the number of events is $d_j = 2$.\n\nIn summary, for the event time $t_j=3$, the risk set size is $n_j=4$ and the number of events is $d_j=2$.

It presents a standard application of the Kaplan-Meier method for estimating a survival function from right-censored data.\n\nThe survival function, $S(t)$, is defined as the probability that the event time $T$ is greater than some time $t$:\n$$S(t) = \\mathbb{P}(T  t)$$\nThe Kaplan-Meier method provides a non-parametric estimate of this function from observed data that may be censored. The core principle is to express the survival function as a product of conditional probabilities over the observed event times.\n\nLet $t_{(1)}  t_{(2)}  \\dots  t_{(k)}$ be the $k$ distinct event times observed in the sample. The probability of surviving past a time $t$, where $t_{(j)} \\le t  t_{(j+1)}$, is equivalent to the probability of surviving past the last observed event time, $t_{(j)}$. This can be expressed using the chain rule of probability:\n$$\nS(t) = \\mathbb{P}(T  t_{(j)}) = \\mathbb{P}(T  t_{(1)} \\text{ and } T  t_{(2)} \\text{ and } \\dots \\text{ and } T  t_{(j)})\n$$\n$$\nS(t) = \\mathbb{P}(T  t_{(1)}) \\times \\mathbb{P}(T  t_{(2)} | T  t_{(1)}) \\times \\dots \\times \\mathbb{P}(T  t_{(j)} | T  t_{(j-1)})\n$$\nThis can be written in product form as:\n$$S(t) = \\prod_{i: t_{(i)} \\le t} \\mathbb{P}(T  t_{(i)} | T  t_{(i-1)}), \\quad \\text{with } t_{(0)} = 0$$\nEach term $\\mathbb{P}(T  t_{(i)} | T  t_{(i-1)})$ is the conditional probability of surviving past time $t_{(i)}$, given survival up to that point. This can be rewritten as $1 - \\mathbb{P}(T = t_{(i)} | T \\ge t_{(i)})$, where the latter term is the conditional probability of an event at $t_{(i)}$, i.e., the hazard at that time.\n\nUnder the assumption of non-informative censoring, we can estimate this conditional probability from the data. We define the following quantities for each distinct event time $t_{(i)}$:\n- The risk set, $R(t_{(i)})$, is the set of all individuals who are still under observation just prior to time $t_{(i)}$.\n- The number at risk, $n_i$, is the size of the risk set, $n_i = |R(t_{(i)})| = |\\{j: Y_j \\ge t_{(i)}\\}|$.\n- The number of events, $d_i$, is the number of individuals who experience the event at time $t_{(i)}$, $d_i = |\\{j: Y_j = t_{(i)}, \\delta_j = 1\\}|$.\n\nThe estimate for the conditional probability of an event at $t_{(i)}$ is the proportion $\\frac{d_i}{n_i}$. Consequently, the estimated conditional probability of surviving past $t_{(i)}$ is $1 - \\frac{d_i}{n_i}$.\n\nSubstituting these estimates into the product form gives the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator for the survival function:\n$$\\hat{S}(t) = \\prod_{i: t_{(i)} \\le t} \\left(1 - \\frac{d_i}{n_i}\\right)$$\nBy convention, $\\hat{S}(0) = 1$. The survival function estimate is a step function that is constant between event times and changes value only at the observed event times.\n\nNow, we apply this to the given data. The total number of patients is $n=5$. The observed data pairs $(Y_i, \\delta_i)$ are $(2,1), (4,0), (4,1), (6,1), (7,0)$.\nThe distinct observed times are $2, 4, 6, 7$.

First event time, $t=2$**\n- The number of individuals at risk just before time $t=2$ is $n_2 = 5$. All patients are still in the study.\n- The number of events at $t=2$ is $d_2 = 1$.\n- The conditional survival probability is $1 - \\frac{d_2}{n_2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}$.\n- The estimated survival function at $t=2$ is $\\hat{S}(2) = \\hat{S}(0) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{d_2}{n_2}\\right) = 1 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}$.\n- After this time point, $1$ patient has had an event.

These are the patients with data $(4,0), (4,1), (6,1), (7,0)$. Thus, the number at risk is $n_4 = 4$.\n- The number of events at $t=4$ is $d_4 = 1$.\n- Per the problem's tie-breaking rule, the event is processed before the censoring. The risk set $n_4=4$ correctly includes both individuals.\n- The conditional survival probability is $1 - \\frac{d_4}{n_4} = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n- The estimated survival function at $t=4$ is $\\hat{S}(4) = \\hat{S}(2) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{d_4}{n_4}\\right) = \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3}{5}$.\n- After this time point, $1$ patient has had an event and $1$ has been censored.
