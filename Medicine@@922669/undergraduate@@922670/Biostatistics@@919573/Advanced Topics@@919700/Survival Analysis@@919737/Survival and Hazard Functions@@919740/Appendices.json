The density of an event of cause $k$ at time $u$ is the product of the probability of surviving until time $u$, $S(u)$, and the instantaneous rate of failure from cause $k$ at time $u$, $\\lambda_k(u)$.

The Kaplan-Meier estimator is designed to estimate a survival function, $S(t)$. If we treat events of cause $2$ as censored when analyzing cause $1$, we are effectively attempting to estimate the survival function in a hypothetical world where cause $2$ does not exist. In such a world, the only hazard present would be $\\lambda_1(t)$. The survival function in this hypothetical world, which we shall call the net survival function $S_1^{net}(t)$, is given by:\n$$ S_1^{net}(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_{0}^{t} \\lambda_{1}(u) \\,du\\right) $$\nThe KM-based quantity for the cumulative probability of event $1$ is therefore $1$ minus this net survival function.

The problem states that $\\lambda_2(t)$ is not identically zero. This implies there exists some interval in $(0, t]$ for any $t0$ where $\\lambda_2(s)  0$.

For all other $u$, $g_1(u) = g_{KM}(u)$ (this occurs if $\\lambda_1(u)=0$ or if $\\int_0^u \\lambda_2(s)ds=0$). Assuming $\\lambda_1(t)$ is also not identically zero (otherwise $F_1(t)=0$ and $F_1^{KM}(t)=0$), the inequality $g_1(u)  g_{KM}(u)$ will be strict over some subinterval of $(0, t]$. Integrating a non-negative function that is strictly positive on a set of non-zero measure yields a positive result. Therefore, integrating both sides from $0$ to $t$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{t} g_1(u) \\,du  \\int_{0}^{t} g_{KM}(u) \\,du $$\nThis proves that $F_1(t)  F_1^{KM}(t)$ for all $t  0$, demonstrating that censoring competing events leads to an overestimation of the cumulative incidence.
