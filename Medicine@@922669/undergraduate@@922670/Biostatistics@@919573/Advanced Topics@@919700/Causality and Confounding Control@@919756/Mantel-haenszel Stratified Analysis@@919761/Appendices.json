[@problem_id:4924632]", "problem": "A case-control study investigates the association between an exposure $X$ and a binary disease outcome $Y$, stratified by clinical severity at presentation (two strata). Let each stratum be represented by a $2 \\times 2$ table with cells $(a_k, b_k, c_k, d_k)$ for stratum $k$, where $a_k$ is the number of exposed cases, $b_k$ is the number of exposed non-cases, $c_k$ is the number of unexposed cases, and $d_k$ is the number of unexposed non-cases. The odds ratio (OR) in any table is defined from first principles as the ratio of the odds, namely $\\text{OR} = \\dfrac{a d}{b c}$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are the cell counts in a $2 \\times 2$ table. The crude odds ratio collapses strata by summing cell counts before forming the same ratio. The data below are scientifically plausible and reflect a scenario where the distribution of exposure $X$ varies strongly by clinical severity, which can create confounding.\n\nStratum $1$ (high severity):\n- Exposed cases $a_1 = 500$\n- Exposed non-cases $b_1 = 500$\n- Unexposed cases $c_1 = 30$\n- Unexposed non-cases $d_1 = 40$\n\nStratum $2$ (low severity):\n- Exposed cases $a_2 = 4$\n- Exposed non-cases $b_2 = 57$\n- Unexposed cases $c_2 = 200$\n- Unexposed non-cases $d_2 = 3800$\n\nUsing only the definition of odds and odds ratios and standard properties of $2 \\times 2$ stratified analysis, first verify that the crude odds ratio formed by collapsing the strata overstates each of the two stratum-specific odds ratios.

Do not round.", "solution": "The user-provided problem has been validated and is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard biostatistics exercise in stratified analysis and requires the computation of various odds ratios. The solution proceeds as follows.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part calculation:\n1.  Compute the stratum-specific odds ratios ($\\text{OR}_k$) for each of the two strata.\n2.  Compute the crude odds ratio ($\\text{OR}_{\\text{crude}}$) by collapsing the strata and verify that it is greater than both stratum-specific odds ratios.\n3.  Compute the Mantel-Haenszel (MH) pooled odds ratio ($\\text{OR}_{\\text{MH}}$) to obtain an adjusted measure of association.\n\nThe strata are defined by the following $2 \\times 2$ tables, where the cells are $(a_k, b_k, c_k, d_k)$:\n- Stratum $k=1$ (high severity):\n  - $a_1 = 500$ (exposed cases)\n  - $b_1 = 500$ (exposed non-cases)\n  - $c_1 = 30$ (unexposed cases)\n  - $d_1 = 40$ (unexposed non-cases)\n- Stratum $k=2$ (low severity):\n  - $a_2 = 4$ (exposed cases)\n  - $b_2 = 57$ (exposed non-cases)\n  - $c_2 = 200$ (unexposed cases)\n  - $d_2 = 3800$ (unexposed non-cases)\n\nThe odds ratio for a given $2 \\times 2$ table is defined as $\\text{OR} = \\frac{ad}{bc}$.\n\n**1. Stratum-Specific Odds Ratios**\n\nFor Stratum $1$:\n$$ \\text{OR}_1 = \\frac{a_1 d_1}{b_1 c_1} = \\frac{(500)(40)}{(500)(30)} = \\frac{40}{30} = \\frac{4}{3} $$\n\nFor Stratum $2$:\n$$ \\text{OR}_2 = \\frac{a_2 d_2}{b_2 c_2} = \\frac{(4)(3800)}{(57)(200)} = \\frac{15200}{11400} = \\frac{152}{114} $$\nTo simplify the fraction $\\frac{152}{114}$, we can find common factors. $152 = 4 \\times 38$ and $114 = 3 \\times 38$.\n$$ \\text{OR}_2 = \\frac{4 \\times 38}{3 \\times 38} = \\frac{4}{3} $$\nThe stratum-specific odds ratios are identical: $\\text{OR}_1 = \\text{OR}_2 = \\frac{4}{3}$. This indicates that the effect of the exposure is homogeneous across the strata of clinical severity (no effect modification).\n\n**2. Crude Odds Ratio and Verification**\n\nTo calculate the crude odds ratio, we first collapse the strata by summing the corresponding cell counts:\n- Total exposed cases: $a = a_1 + a_2 = 500 + 4 = 504$\n- Total exposed non-cases: $b = b_1 + b_2 = 500 + 57 = 557$\n- Total unexposed cases: $c = c_1 + c_2 = 30 + 200 = 230$\n- Total unexposed non-cases: $d = d_1 + d_2 = 40 + 3800 = 3840$\n\nThe crude odds ratio is then:\n$$ \\text{OR}_{\\text{crude}} = \\frac{ad}{bc} = \\frac{(504)(3840)}{(557)(230)} = \\frac{1935360}{128110} = \\frac{193536}{12811} $$\nTo compare this with the stratum-specific odds ratios, we can approximate the values:\n$$ \\text{OR}_{\\text{crude}} \\approx 15.107 $$\n$$ \\text{OR}_1 = \\text{OR}_2 = \\frac{4}{3} \\approx 1.333 $$\nClearly, $\\text{OR}_{\\text{crude}} > \\text{OR}_1$ and $\\text{OR}_{\\text{crude}} > \\text{OR}_2$. The crude odds ratio significantly overstates the association found within each stratum. This is a classic example of confounding, where the stratifying variable (clinical severity) is associated with both the exposure and the outcome, creating a spurious overall association when not properly adjusted.\n\n**3. Mantel-Haenszel Pooled Odds Ratio**\n\nThe Mantel-Haenszel formula provides a pooled odds ratio, adjusted for the stratifying variable. It is a weighted average of the stratum-specific odds ratios. The formula is:\n$$ \\text{OR}_{\\text{MH}} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\frac{a_k d_k}{N_k}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\frac{b_k c_k}{N_k}} $$\nwhere $N_k = a_k + b_k + c_k + d_k$ is the total number of subjects in stratum $k$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of subjects in each stratum:\n- $N_1 = 500 + 500 + 30 + 40 = 1070$\n- $N_2 = 4 + 57 + 200 + 3800 = 4061$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerator and denominator of the $\\text{OR}_{\\text{MH}}$ formula.\nNumerator:\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\frac{a_k d_k}{N_k} = \\frac{(500)(40)}{1070} + \\frac{(4)(3800)}{4061} = \\frac{20000}{1070} + \\frac{15200}{4061} $$\n\nDenominator:\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\frac{b_k c_k}{N_k} = \\frac{(500)(30)}{1070} + \\frac{(57)(200)}{4061} = \\frac{15000}{1070} + \\frac{11400}{4061} $$\n\nWe can rewrite the numerator terms using the stratum-specific odds ratios, $\\text{OR}_k = \\frac{a_k d_k}{b_k c_k}$, which implies $a_k d_k = \\text{OR}_k \\cdot b_k c_k$.\nSince we found that $\\text{OR}_1 = \\text{OR}_2 = \\frac{4}{3}$, we can substitute $\\text{OR}_k = \\frac{4}{3}$ for both strata:\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\frac{a_k d_k}{N_k} = \\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right) b_k c_k}{N_k} = \\frac{4}{3} \\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\frac{b_k c_k}{N_k} $$\nNow we can express the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio as:\n$$ \\text{OR}_{\\text{MH}} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3} \\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\frac{b_k c_k}{N_k}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\frac{b_k c_k}{N_k}} $$\nThe term $\\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\frac{b_k c_k}{N_k}$ is a non-zero sum of non-negative weights, so it can be cancelled from the numerator and denominator.\n$$ \\text{OR}_{\\text{MH}} = \\frac{4}{3} $$\nThis result demonstrates a key property of the Mantel-Haenszel estimator: when the odds ratio is constant across all strata (i.e., no effect modification), the MH pooled odds ratio is equal to that common odds ratio. The calculation provides the adjusted common odds ratio, which correctly reflects the association after accounting for the confounding effect of clinical severity.\nThe final answer is requested as an exact reduced fraction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}$$", "id": "4924632"}, {"introduction": "The Mantel-Haenszel estimator is a powerful tool for pooling information, but it relies on the crucial assumption that the effect (the odds ratio) is reasonably consistent, or homogeneous, across all strata.

Such zeros would otherwise cause the stratum-specific odds ratio to be $0$ or infinite, or its variance to be undefined, problematic outcomes for computation.\n\nThe problem specified a correction only for strata containing zeros (Strata $1$ and $2$). An alternative approach is to add $0.5$ to all cells in *all* strata, including Stratum $3$. The sensitivity of $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$ to this choice depends on the characteristics of the strata that would be additionally corrected. In Stratum $3$, where the cell counts ($12, 30, 15, 43$) are all non-zero and reasonably large, adding $0.5$ to each cell would cause a very small perturbation. The stratum-specific odds ratio for Stratum $3$ is $\\hat{\\theta}_3 = (12 \\times 43)/(30 \\times 15) = 516/450 \\approx 1.147$. If corrected, it would become $(12.5 \\times 43.5)/(30.5 \\times 15.5) \\approx 1.150$. This minor change, along with a similarly small change in its weight ($S_3$), would have a minimal impact on the overall $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$ estimate. Thus, for strata with large counts and no zeros, the choice of whether to apply the correction has little practical consequence on the final pooled estimate. The correction's significant effect is confined to strata where it is mathematically necessary due to the presence of zeros.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.217}\n$$", "id": "4809054"}]}
