## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having established the statistical principles and mechanics of Mantel-Haenszel (MH) stratified analysis in the preceding chapter, we now turn to its application. The true value of a statistical method is realized in its capacity to solve real-world problems and provide clarity in complex data settings. The MH framework is a quintessential example of a tool that is both theoretically elegant and profoundly practical. This chapter explores the diverse applications of MH analysis across various scientific disciplines, demonstrating its versatility in controlling for confounding, evaluating effect modification, and connecting to broader statistical concepts. We will see how this method is a cornerstone of study design and analysis in epidemiology, a crucial tool in modern medical genetics, a safeguard in the interpretation of clinical trials, and a foundational concept with deep ties to regression modeling and [meta-analysis](@entry_id:263874).

### Core Applications in Epidemiological Study Designs

Observational epidemiology is the primary domain for which Mantel-Haenszel methods were developed. By stratifying on key variables, researchers can dissect the relationship between an exposure and an outcome, isolating the association of interest from the distorting effects of confounding variables.

#### Confounding Control in Cohort Studies

In cohort studies, where groups of exposed and unexposed individuals are followed over time, investigators can directly estimate outcome risks. This allows for the calculation of several effect measures, including the risk ratio ($RR$), risk difference ($RD$), and odds ratio ($OR$). The Mantel-Haenszel framework is adaptable to all these measures.

A particularly powerful modern application is in pharmacoepidemiology, where MH methods are often used in conjunction with propensity score analysis. In non-randomized studies comparing a new drug to a standard therapy, confounding by indication is a major concern—clinicians may preferentially prescribe the new drug to sicker or healthier patients. The [propensity score](@entry_id:635864), which estimates the probability of receiving treatment based on an array of baseline covariates, can be used to stratify the study population. For example, by creating deciles of the propensity score, one creates ten strata where the distributions of measured confounders are balanced between the treatment groups. The MH procedure can then be used to compute a pooled risk difference across these strata, providing a single, adjusted estimate of the average treatment effect. This approach has been used to estimate the effect of new oral anticoagulants versus traditional therapies on outcomes like hospitalization, yielding an estimate of the absolute risk reduction attributable to the new treatment after accounting for dozens of baseline factors. [@problem_id:4809009]

This highlights a key principle: in a cohort study, because risks are directly estimable, the MH estimators for the risk ratio ($\hat{RR}_{MH}$) and risk difference ($\hat{RD}_{MH}$) are identifiable and appropriate summaries of effect, provided the necessary causal assumptions like conditional exchangeability hold. Their [identifiability](@entry_id:194150) does not depend on the outcome being rare. The odds ratio ($\hat{\theta}_{MH}$) is also always estimable and may be chosen for its desirable statistical properties, and it serves as a good approximation of the risk ratio when the outcome is rare. [@problem_id:4809056] A comprehensive analysis plan for an observational cohort study will therefore define strata based on potential confounders and effect modifiers, use the MH method to generate adjusted estimates, and include a suite of sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the findings. [@problem_id:4808986]

#### The Central Role in Case-Control Studies

In case-control studies, where subjects are sampled based on their disease status, risks and risk ratios cannot be directly estimated. Here, the odds ratio becomes the primary measure of association, and the MH method is the canonical tool for stratified analysis. A fundamental property of the odds ratio is its invariance to case-control sampling; the odds ratio of exposure in cases versus controls is equivalent to the odds ratio of disease in the exposed versus unexposed.

The Mantel-Haenszel pooled odds ratio leverages this property across strata. It consistently estimates the common conditional odds ratio, provided the odds ratio is homogeneous across strata and the sampling of controls is independent of exposure status within each stratum. Crucially, this estimation does not require the "rare disease assumption." That assumption is only necessary if one wishes to interpret the estimated odds ratio as an approximation of a risk ratio. The validity of the MH odds ratio itself, as a measure of association, is independent of disease prevalence. [@problem_id:4924675] This makes the MH method exceptionally robust for case-control studies. A typical application might involve a study of an oral potentially malignant disorder like leukoplakia, where researchers want to assess its association with high-risk alcohol consumption while controlling for the known confounding effect of tobacco use. By stratifying on tobacco status (e.g., never, former, current users), the MH estimator provides a single summary odds ratio for the effect of alcohol, adjusted for tobacco use. [@problem_id:4744660]

#### Matched Designs as a Special Case of Stratification

Matching is a study design technique used to control for confounding by ensuring that the distribution of one or more confounders is identical in the compared groups. It can be understood as an extreme form of stratification. In individual or pair matching, each case is matched to one or more controls on specific variables (e.g., age, sex), creating strata of size two (for 1:1 matching) or more.

The connection between matching and stratification is mathematically precise. For a 1:1 matched case-control study, each pair constitutes a single stratum. When the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) [chi-square test](@entry_id:136579) for no association is applied to this series of $2 \times 2$ tables, it simplifies algebraically to the well-known McNemar's [test statistic](@entry_id:167372). This test depends only on the number of [discordant pairs](@entry_id:166371) (pairs where the case and control have different exposure statuses). The concordant pairs (where both are exposed or both are unexposed) provide no information about the association. This elegant result demonstrates that matched analysis is a specific application of the broader principle of stratified analysis. [@problem_id:4809004]

It is critical to distinguish between individual matching and frequency matching. Individual matching creates explicit matched sets that must be accounted for in the analysis using conditional methods (like conditional [logistic regression](@entry_id:136386), which is an extension of the MH principle). Frequency matching, which only balances the overall distribution of a confounder between cases and controls, does not create such sets and is typically handled by including the confounder as a covariate in a standard (unconditional) logistic regression or through a standard MH stratified analysis. [@problem_id:4973505]

### Application in Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)

While randomization is the gold standard for eliminating confounding on average, stratification and MH methods remain vital tools in the design and analysis of RCTs for several reasons.

#### Adjusting for Chance Imbalance and Increasing Precision

In any given RCT, particularly those with smaller sample sizes, "chance" can lead to an imbalance in the distribution of an important prognostic factor between the treatment and control arms. If this factor is strongly associated with the outcome, this imbalance can distort the estimate of the treatment effect. For example, in a vaccine trial, if the vaccine arm happens to have a higher proportion of individuals with pre-existing immunity (seropositives) than the control arm, a crude (unadjusted) comparison of infection rates will yield a biased estimate of [vaccine efficacy](@entry_id:194367). By stratifying the analysis on baseline serostatus and calculating an adjusted summary measure—either through direct standardization or an MH-type estimator—one can obtain a more accurate estimate of the true treatment effect. [@problem_id:4567975]

To proactively guard against such imbalances, investigators can employ [stratified randomization](@entry_id:189937). For instance, in an [assisted reproductive technology](@entry_id:199569) trial comparing two embryo [cryopreservation](@entry_id:173046) protocols, patient age and baseline embryo quality are powerful predictors of success. By stratifying randomization based on these factors (e.g., age groups $35$, $35-39$, $\ge 40$), researchers ensure that the treatment arms are well-balanced on these key variables. This not only protects against chance confounding but also generally increases the statistical power of the trial by explaining a portion of the outcome variability. When [stratified randomization](@entry_id:189937) is used in the design, a corresponding stratified analysis must be used to analyze the data. [@problem_id:4479004]

#### Summarizing Evidence and Interpreting Non-Adherence

The peril of ignoring necessary stratification in the presence of imbalances is powerfully illustrated by Simpson's Paradox, where a trend observed within different groups of data reverses when those groups are combined. Consider a randomized trial of a new therapy where, due to site-specific enrollment patterns, the treatment arm ends up with a higher proportion of high-risk patients than the control arm. It is entirely possible for the treatment to show a consistent benefit (e.g., a risk ratio of $0.8$) within each of the low-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk strata, yet for the crude, unstratified analysis to yield a risk ratio greater than $1.0$, falsely suggesting harm. [@problem_id:4809005] For clinical guideline development, relying on such a crude estimate would be dangerously misleading. The Mantel-Haenszel adjusted measure, by properly weighting the stratum-specific effects, resolves the paradox and provides an accurate summary of the treatment's efficacy, forming a valid basis for a single, population-level recommendation. [@problem_id:4809005] [@problem_id:4808986] This underscores the principle that when stratum-specific effects are reasonably homogeneous, the MH-adjusted measure provides a robust common-effect summary that is essential for evidence-based medicine. [@problem_id:4809005]

Furthermore, in real-world trials, non-adherence to the assigned protocol can occur. If this non-adherence is non-random (e.g., clinicians preferentially switch high-risk patients away from a new protocol), an "as-treated" or "per-protocol" analysis becomes confounded. The standard intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, which analyzes patients according to their original randomized assignment, preserves the benefits of randomization and provides an unbiased estimate of the effect of *assigning* the treatment. Stratified analysis remains crucial within the ITT framework to ensure precision and adjust for any chance imbalances. [@problem_id:4479004]

### Interdisciplinary Connections and Advanced Topics

The principles of Mantel-Haenszel analysis extend far beyond classic epidemiology, finding critical applications in fields like genetics and forming the conceptual basis for more complex statistical models.

#### Controlling for Population Stratification in Genetic Epidemiology

In [genetic association](@entry_id:195051) studies, a major source of confounding is population stratification. If a genetic variant has a different frequency in different ancestral populations, and the disease being studied also has a different prevalence across those populations, a simple case-control comparison can produce a spurious association. For example, if cases are disproportionately recruited from an ancestry group where the allele happens to be more common, the allele will appear to be associated with the disease even if there is no causal link. [@problem_id:4452852]

Stratified analysis is the definitive solution to this problem. By stratifying the analysis by genetic ancestry (e.g., European, East Asian, African), the association between the variant and the disease is assessed within each homogeneous ancestral group. The Mantel-Haenszel method is then used to pool the odds ratios across these strata, yielding a summary OR that is adjusted for ancestry. This adjusted OR correctly reflects the association, free from the confounding effect of [population structure](@entry_id:148599). [@problem_id:4452852] This approach is a cornerstone of modern [medical genetics](@entry_id:262833), used, for example, in evaluating the evidence for variant [pathogenicity](@entry_id:164316) under the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) guidelines. The PS4 criterion ("prevalence in affected individuals significantly increased over controls") is formally assessed using the odds ratio from a well-designed, ancestry-stratified case-control study. [@problem_id:5010022]

#### Relationship to Regression Modeling and Meta-Analysis

The Mantel-Haenszel framework does not exist in isolation; it is deeply connected to two other pillars of modern statistics: regression modeling and meta-analysis.

The assumption of a common odds ratio across strata, which underlies the MH method, has a direct parallel in logistic regression. A [logistic regression model](@entry_id:637047) with a term for exposure, terms for the strata, but no interaction terms, implicitly assumes that the exposure's [log-odds](@entry_id:141427) ratio is constant across strata. A model that includes exposure-by-stratum interaction terms explicitly allows the odds ratio to differ. Consequently, testing for the homogeneity of odds ratios using the Breslow-Day test is conceptually equivalent to performing a [likelihood ratio test](@entry_id:170711) on the significance of the interaction terms in a [logistic regression model](@entry_id:637047). A significant result in either test indicates the presence of effect modification, suggesting that a single pooled MH odds ratio may be an inadequate summary of the data. [@problem_id:4924597]

Furthermore, the Mantel-Haenszel estimator can be viewed as a form of meta-analysis. It has been shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the inverse-variance weighted fixed-effect [meta-analysis](@entry_id:263874) of the stratum-specific [log-odds](@entry_id:141427) ratios. The "effective" weight given to each stratum in the MH formula is asymptotically proportional to the inverse of the variance of that stratum's log-odds ratio. This insight connects the classical stratified analysis of a single study to the broader methodology used to synthesize evidence across multiple independent studies. [@problem_id:4924629]

#### Practical Considerations: Sparse Data and Continuity Corrections

In practice, particularly when stratifying finely or when events are rare, some cells in the $2 \times 2$ tables may have zero counts. This can cause the stratum-specific odds ratio to be undefined (zero or infinite), and while the MH pooled estimate is often still calculable, its variance estimators can become unstable. A common pragmatic solution is to apply a "[continuity correction](@entry_id:263775)," such as adding a small number (typically $0.5$) to every cell in the table. This practice eliminates the zero cells, allowing for calculation of all quantities. However, it is not a neutral act; the correction systematically pulls the [point estimate](@entry_id:176325) toward the null value of $1.0$ and can alter the variance estimate and the width of the confidence interval. [@problem_id:4609458] While widely used, continuity corrections are an approximation, and in the modern era, using exact conditional methods (based on the [hypergeometric distribution](@entry_id:193745)) is often a superior approach for handling sparse data.

### Conclusion

The Mantel-Haenszel framework is far more than a formula for pooling $2 \times 2$ tables. It is a foundational conceptual tool for modern biomedical research. Its applications demonstrate a unifying principle: to understand the relationship between two variables, one must often account for the influence of a third. Whether that third variable is a classic confounder like tobacco use, an imbalanced prognostic factor in a clinical trial, or genetic ancestry in a genomic study, the logic of stratification provides a path to a clearer, more valid conclusion. Through its deep connections to matching, regression, and meta-analysis, the Mantel-Haenszel method serves as a bridge from classical epidemiology to the integrated [statistical modeling](@entry_id:272466) that defines contemporary science, securing its place as an indispensable technique for any researcher seeking to draw causal inferences from complex data.
