To accommodate overdispersion relative to the Poisson, a widely used alternative is the Negative Binomial type $2$ (NB2), defined as the Poisson–Gamma mixture: conditional on a latent rate $\\Lambda$, $Y\\mid \\Lambda\\sim\\text{Poisson}(\\Lambda)$, and the latent rate follows a Gamma distribution $\\Lambda\\sim\\text{Gamma}(\\text{shape}=r,\\text{scale}=s)$, with $r=1/\\alpha$ and $s=\\alpha\\mu$, so that $E(Y)=\\mu$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(Y)=\\mu(1+\\alpha\\mu)$.

Subsequently, this probability is to be compared to that from a standard Poisson model by forming a ratio, $R$. Finally, a numerical value for this ratio is to be computed using provided sample moments.\n\nFirst, we derive the marginal probability $P_{\\text{NB2}}(Y=y)$. The problem states that conditional on a latent rate $\\Lambda$, the count $Y$ follows a Poisson distribution, $Y \\mid \\Lambda \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\Lambda)$. Its probability mass function (PMF) is $P(Y=y \\mid \\Lambda=\\lambda) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda)\\lambda^y}{y!}$.

The parameters of the Gamma distribution are specified as $r=1/\\alpha$ and $s=\\alpha\\mu$.\n\nThe marginal probability of $Y$ is obtained by integrating the joint probability of $Y$ and $\\Lambda$ over all possible values of $\\Lambda$. This is an application of the law of total probability:\n$$P(Y=y) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} P(Y=y \\mid \\Lambda=\\lambda) f_{\\Lambda}(\\lambda) \\, d\\lambda$$\nWe are tasked with finding this probability for the specific case where the count is zero, i.e., $y=0$. For $y=0$, the conditional Poisson probability simplifies to:\n$$P(Y=0 \\mid \\Lambda=\\lambda) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda)\\lambda^0}{0!} = \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nSubstituting this and the Gamma PDF into the integral for the marginal probability gives:\n$$P_{\\text{NB2}}(Y=0) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\lambda) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(r)s^r} \\lambda^{r-1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda}{s}\\right) \\right) \\, d\\lambda$$\nWe can rearrange the terms by pulling the constants outside the integral and combining the exponential functions:\n$$P_{\\text{NB2}}(Y=0) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(r)s^r} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\lambda^{r-1} \\exp\\left(-\\lambda - \\frac{\\lambda}{s}\\right) \\, d\\lambda$$\n$$P_{\\text{NB2}}(Y=0) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(r)s^r} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\lambda^{r-1} \\exp\\left(-\\lambda\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{s}\\right)\\right) \\, d\\lambda$$\n$$P_{\\text{NB2}}(Y=0) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(r)s^r} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\lambda^{r-1} \\exp\\left(-\\lambda\\frac{s+1}{s}\\right) \\, d\\lambda$$\nThe integral is a standard form related to the Gamma function. The general form of this integral is $\\int_0^\\infty x^{k-1} \\exp(-ax) \\, dx = \\frac{\\Gamma(k)}{a^k}$.

For a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu$, the probability of a zero count is $P_{\\text{Poisson}}(Y=0) = \\exp(-\\mu)$. The ratio $R$ is therefore:\n$$R = \\frac{P_{\\text{NB2}}(Y=0)}{P_{\\text{Poisson}}(Y=0)} = \\frac{(1+\\alpha\\mu)^{-1/\\alpha}}{\\exp(-\\mu)}$$\n$$R = \\exp(\\mu) (1+\\alpha\\mu)^{-1/\\alpha}$$\nThe ratio $R$ quantifies the excess of zeros in the NB2 model relative to the Poisson model for a given mean $\\mu$ and overdispersion $\\alpha$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $R$. The problem provides the observed sample mean $\\mu=1.5$ and sample variance $\\sigma^2=4.5$. The overdispersion coefficient $\\alpha$ is estimated by the method of moments using the formula:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{\\sigma^{2}-\\mu}{\\mu^{2}} = \\frac{4.5 - 1.5}{(1.5)^{2}} = \\frac{3.0}{2.25} = \\frac{4}{3}$$\nWith the values of $\\mu=1.5$ and $\\alpha=4/3$, we can compute $R$:\n$$R = \\exp(1.5) \\left(1 + \\frac{4}{3} \\times 1.5\\right)^{-1/(4/3)}$$\nFirst, we simplify the base of the power term:\n$$1 + \\frac{4}{3} \\times 1.5 = 1 + \\frac{4}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 1 + 2 = 3$$\nThe exponent is $-1/\\alpha = -1/(4/3) = -3/4$.
