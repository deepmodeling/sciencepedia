For $n'=12$, this sum is $\\frac{12(12+1)}{2} = \\frac{12 \\times 13}{2} = 78$. The sum of the absolute values of the negative ranks, $W^{-}$, is $1.5 + 4.5 + 4.5 + 7.5 + 9.5 + 11.5 = 39.0$.

There is one difference of $0$. The standard procedure for the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is to discard zero differences. This reduces the effective sample size from $n=10$ to $n'=9$.\n2.  **List Nonzero Differences and their Absolute Values**:\n    - Nonzero differences: $(-3,\\,-1,\\,-2,\\,-4,\\,1,\\,-2,\\,-3,\\,-1,\\,-2)$.\n    - Absolute values: $(3,\\,1,\\,2,\\,4,\\,1,\\,2,\\,3,\\,1,\\,2)$.\n3.  **Rank the Absolute Values**: We order the absolute values and assign ranks, using the average rank for ties.\n    - Sorted absolute values: $(1,\\,1,\\,1,\\,2,\\,2,\\,2,\\,3,\\,3,\\,4)$.\n    - The three values of $1$ occupy ranks $1, 2, 3$. Their average rank is $(1+2+3)/3 = 2$.\n    - The three values of $2$ occupy ranks $4, 5, 6$. Their average rank is $(4+5+6)/3 = 5$.\n    - The two values of $3$ occupy ranks $7, 8$. Their average rank is $(7+8)/2 = 7.5$.\n    - The one value of $4$ occupies rank $9$. Its rank is $9$.\n4.  **Assign Signs to Ranks and Sum**: We create signed ranks based on the original sign of each difference and then sum the positive and negative ranks separately.\n    - The only positive difference is $1$. Its assigned rank is $2$.\n    - The sum of positive ranks is $W^+ = 2$.\n    - The negative differences are $-1$ (three times), $-2$ (three times), $-3$ (two times), and $-4$ (one time). Their ranks are $2$, $5$, $7.5$, and $9$ respectively.\n    - The sum of negative ranks is $W^- = (3 \\times 2) + (3 \\times 5) + (2 \\times 7.5) + (1 \\times 9) = 6 + 15 + 15 + 9 = 43$.\n    - As a check, the total sum of ranks is $W^+ + W^- = 2 + 43 = 45$. This equals the sum of integers from $1$ to $9$, which is $n'(n'+1)/2 = 9(10)/2 = 45$. The calculation is correct.\n\nThe test statistic for the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is $W = \\min(W^+, W^-) = \\min(2, 43) = 2$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. With these data, a two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test at level $\\alpha=0.05$ would justifiably conclude that the median paired difference differs from $0$. Reporting should state the estimated direction (here, a decrease, because the estimated location shift is negative) and a two-sided confidence interval; however, the primary inferential claim remains non-directional in the sense that it rejects $H_0\\!:\\ \\text{median}=0$ without having pre-specified a direction.**\n\nTo evaluate this, we compare our test statistic $W=2$ to the critical value for a two-sided test with $n'=9$ at $\\alpha=0.05$. From standard statistical tables for the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, the critical value is $5$. The null hypothesis is rejected if $W$ is less than or equal to the critical value. Since $2 \\le 5$, we reject $H_0$. The conclusion that the median difference differs from $0$ is statistically justified. It is standard and good practice to report the observed direction of the effect (which is clearly a reduction, as $W^- \\gg W^+$) along with a two-sided confidence interval, which is the interval type that corresponds to a two-sided test. The final point is crucial: a two-sided test, by definition, tests for a difference in any direction. The formal conclusion is non-directional ($\\text{median} \\neq 0$), even though we can and should describe the nature of the observed difference post-hoc. The statement is entirely accurate.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. If the directional alternative $H_1\\!:\\ \\text{median difference}<0$ was pre-specified based on strong prior biological and clinical considerations that increases were implausible or clinically unacceptable, then a one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test at level $\\alpha=0.05$ would have greater power in the predicted direction and would yield a smaller $p$-value than the corresponding two-sided test, supporting a directional conclusion that the median difference is less than $0$.**\n\nThis statement correctly outlines the rationale and properties of a one-sided test. First, it correctly states that a one-sided test must be justified by strong *a priori* reasoning, as suggested by the problem's mention of \"expect a reduction\". Second, for a given effect size and sample size, a one-sided test at level $\\alpha$ is more powerful than a two-sided test at the same $\\alpha$ level for detecting an effect *in the pre-specified direction*. This is because the entire rejection region of size $\\alpha$ is placed in one tail of the sampling distribution. Third, for results in the expected direction, the one-sided $p$-value is smaller than the two-sided $p$-value (often, it is half). Finally, if $H_0$ is rejected in favor of $H_1\\!:\\ \\text{median difference}<0$, the statistical conclusion is inherently directional. The statement is a correct description of statistical principles.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Choosing a one-sided alternative after inspecting the data (because the observed differences mostly point in one direction) does not affect the Type I error rate and is acceptable for increasing power.**\n\nThis statement describes a prohibited practice in hypothesis testing. Choosing the direction of the alternative hypothesis after observing the data is a form of data-dredging or \"p-hacking\". If this were allowed, an investigator would always choose the direction that looks promising, effectively running a test that looks for an extreme result in *either* tail but then using the less stringent criterion of a one-sided test. This practice inflates the actual Type I error rate. For a nominal one-sided $\\alpha=0.05$, the true probability of making a Type I error becomes $0.10$, because the researcher would have claimed significance if the data had been strongly positive *or* if the data had been strongly negative. Therefore, the claim that this \"does not affect the Type I error rate\" is false, and the practice is unacceptable.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. In Wilcoxon signed-rank or sign testing, “two-sided” means testing $H_0\\!:\\ \\text{median}=0$ against $H_1\\!:\\ \\text{median}\\neq 0$, while “one-sided” means testing against $H_1\\!:\\ \\text{median}<0$ or $H_1\\!:\\ \\text{median}>0$ as pre-specified; the choice changes both the rejection region and the appropriate confidence interval interpretation, with a two-sided test pairing to a two-sided interval and a one-sided test pairing to a one-sided bound that supports minimum-effect claims in the specified direction.**\n\nThis is a concise and accurate summary of the framework of hypothesis testing and its duality with confidence interval estimation. The definitions of one-sided and two-sided hypotheses are correct. The choice indeed alters the rejection region (e.g., for $\\alpha=0.05$, a two-sided test has rejection regions of size $0.025$ in each tail, while a one-sided test has a single rejection region of size $0.05$). The correspondence between test type and CI type (two-sided test $\\leftrightarrow$ two-sided interval; one-sided test $\\leftrightarrow$ one-sided bound) is a fundamental principle. The interpretation of a one-sided bound is also correctly described. For example, if a one-sided test for $H_1\\!:\\ \\text{median}<0$ leads to a $95\\%$ upper confidence bound of $-0.5$, this means we are $95\\%$ confident the median difference is at most $-0.5$, which is a claim about the minimum magnitude of the reduction.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. When zero differences occur in paired data, they should be counted as evidence in the direction of the majority of nonzero differences to increase the sensitivity of both the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the sign test.**\n\nThis describes an incorrect and biased procedure for handling zeros.\n- For the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, the standard, universally accepted method is to discard zeros and reduce the sample size, as done in our calculations. Zero differences cannot be ranked as their absolute value is $0$.\n- For the sign test, zeros are also typically dropped. A zero difference is direct evidence for the null hypothesis (no change), so assigning it to the majority direction to \"increase sensitivity\" is a biased manipulation of data to favor rejection of the null. It violates the principles of the test and would inflate the Type I error rate. Legitimate increases in sensitivity (power) come from larger sample sizes or more efficient tests, not from biased data handling.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "4933907"}]}
