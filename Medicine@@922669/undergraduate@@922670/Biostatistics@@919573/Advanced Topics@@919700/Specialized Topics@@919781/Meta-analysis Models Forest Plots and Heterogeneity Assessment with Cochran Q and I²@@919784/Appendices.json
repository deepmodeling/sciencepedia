The model is given by $y_i = \\mu + \\epsilon_i$, where the sampling errors $\\epsilon_i$ are independent and follow a normal distribution with mean $0$ and known variance $s_i^2$, i.e., $\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, s_i^2)$.\n\nThe optimal pooled estimate $\\hat{\\mu}$ for the common effect $\\mu$ is a weighted average of the individual study estimates, where each study's weight is the inverse of its sampling variance. The weight for study $i$ is $w_i = \\frac{1}{s_i^2}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the variances and corresponding weights for the three studies.\nThe given study estimates are $y_1=0.2$, $y_2=0.5$, and $y_3=-0.1$.\nThe given standard errors are $s_1=0.1$, $s_2=0.2$, and $s_3=0.15$.\n\nThe variances are:\n$s_1^2 = (0.1)^2 = 0.01$\n$s_2^2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04$\n$s_3^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225$\n\nThe inverse-variance weights are:\n$w_1 = \\frac{1}{s_1^2} = \\frac{1}{0.01} = 100$\n$w_2 = \\frac{1}{s_2^2} = \\frac{1}{0.04} = 25$\n$w_3 = \\frac{1}{s_3^2} = \\frac{1}{0.0225} = \\frac{1}{225/10000} = \\frac{10000}{225} = \\frac{400}{9}$\n\nThe pooled estimator $\\hat{\\mu}$ is calculated as:\n$$ \\hat{\\mu} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^k w_i y_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^k w_i} $$\nFirst, we compute the sum of the weights, $\\sum w_i$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^3 w_i = w_1 + w_2 + w_3 = 100 + 25 + \\frac{400}{9} = 125 + \\frac{400}{9} = \\frac{1125 + 400}{9} = \\frac{1525}{9} $$\nNext, we compute the sum of the weighted estimates, $\\sum w_i y_i$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^3 w_i y_i = w_1 y_1 + w_2 y_2 + w_3 y_3 = 100(0.2) + 25(0.5) + \\frac{400}{9}(-0.1) $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^3 w_i y_i = 20 + 12.5 - \\frac{40}{9} = 32.5 - \\frac{40}{9} = \\frac{65}{2} - \\frac{40}{9} = \\frac{585 - 80}{18} = \\frac{505}{18} $$\nNow, we can compute $\\hat{\\mu}$:\n$$ \\hat{\\mu} = \\frac{505/18}{1525/9} = \\frac{505}{18} \\cdot \\frac{9}{1525} = \\frac{505}{2 \\cdot 1525} = \\frac{505}{3050} = \\frac{101}{610} \\approx 0.16557377... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\hat{\\mu} \\approx 0.1656$.\n\nThe variance of the pooled estimator is the reciprocal of the sum of the weights:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\mu}) = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^k w_i} = \\frac{1}{1525/9} = \\frac{9}{1525} $$\nThe standard error of the pooled estimator is the square root of its variance:\n$$ SE(\\hat{\\mu}) = \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\mu})} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{1525}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{1525}} \\approx 0.07682212... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $SE(\\hat{\\mu}) \\approx 0.07682$.\n\nA large-sample $95\\%$ confidence interval (CI) for $\\mu$ is given by:\n$$ CI = \\hat{\\mu} \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\cdot SE(\\hat{\\mu}) $$\nFor a $95\\%$ CI, $\\alpha = 0.05$, so $1-\\alpha/2 = 0.975$.

This exercise introduces Cochran’s $Q$ statistic and the widely used $I^2$ index [@problem_id:4927516], which allow you to test this assumption and quantify the proportion of total variation that is due to true between-study differences, or heterogeneity, rather than random sampling error.", "problem": "A team conducts a fixed-effect meta-analysis of $6$ Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) that estimate the same log-risk ratio outcome using inverse-variance weights.

Assume standard conditions for inverse-variance meta-analysis under the homogeneity null hypothesis, in which the dispersion of study-specific effects around the common effect arises solely from within-study sampling error.\n\nStarting from the definition of Cochran’s $Q$ as a weighted dispersion and the fact that under homogeneity $Q$ follows an approximately chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to $k-1$, derive a dimensionless measure that represents the proportion of the observed dispersion attributable to between-study heterogeneity rather than to sampling error.

It provides a standard scenario in biostatistics for which a derivation and calculation are requested. All necessary information is provided.\n\nThe derivation of the heterogeneity measure, $I^2$, begins with the definition and properties of Cochran's $Q$ statistic. For a meta-analysis of $k$ studies, Cochran's $Q$ is defined as the weighted sum of squared differences between the individual study effect estimates, $\\hat{\\theta}_i$, and the pooled fixed-effect estimate, $\\hat{\\theta}_{\\text{FE}}$:\n$$Q = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i (\\hat{\\theta}_i - \\hat{\\theta}_{\\text{FE}})^2$$\nThe weights, $w_i$, are the inverse of the within-study variances, $w_i = 1/v_i$, where $v_i$ is the variance of the effect estimate for study $i$. The quantity $Q$ represents the total observed dispersion of the study effects around the pooled mean.\n\nUnder the null hypothesis of homogeneity ($H_0$), it is assumed that there is no between-study heterogeneity. This means all studies are estimating the same underlying true effect, and any observed differences between the $\\hat{\\theta}_i$ values are due solely to within-study sampling error. Under this assumption, the statistic $Q$ follows an approximate chi-square ($\\chi^2$) distribution with degrees of freedom $df = k-1$.\n\nThe expected value of a variable following a $\\chi^2$ distribution is equal to its degrees of freedom. Therefore, the expected value of $Q$ under the homogeneity null hypothesis is:\n$$E[Q | H_0] = k-1$$\nThis value, $k-1$, can be interpreted as the amount of dispersion that is expected to occur purely from sampling error (chance) when there is no true heterogeneity.\n\nThe observed value of $Q$ reflects the total dispersion present in the data. The dispersion that is attributable to true between-study heterogeneity can be estimated by subtracting the dispersion expected from sampling error from the total observed dispersion. This \"excess\" dispersion is given by the difference $Q - (k-1)$.\n\nThe problem asks for a dimensionless measure that represents the proportion of the observed dispersion attributable to between-study heterogeneity. This is calculated by taking the ratio of the excess dispersion to the total observed dispersion:\n$$\\text{Proportion} = \\frac{\\text{Excess Dispersion}}{\\text{Total Dispersion}} = \\frac{Q - (k-1)}{Q}$$\nThis statistic is denoted as $I^2$.\nAs specified, this measure must be non-negative. If the observed $Q$ is less than its expected value $k-1$, it implies that the observed dispersion is even less than what would be expected from sampling error alone. In this case, there is no statistical evidence of heterogeneity, and the amount attributable to heterogeneity is considered to be zero. Therefore, the formal definition of $I^2$ incorporates this non-negativity constraint:\n$$I^2 = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{Q - (k-1)}{Q}\\right)$$\nThis can also be written as $I^2 = 1 - \\frac{k-1}{Q}$ for $Q \\ge k-1$, and $I^2 = 0$ otherwise. The $I^2$ statistic is dimensionless as it is a ratio of two quantities with the same units of dispersion.\n\nNow, we compute the value of $I^2$ for the given data:\nNumber of studies, $k=6$.\nObserved Cochran's $Q$ statistic, $Q=12.5$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the degrees of freedom:\n$$df = k - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5$$\nNext, we compare the observed $Q$ to the degrees of freedom. Since $Q = 12.5$ is greater than $df = 5$, there is evidence of excess dispersion, and we can proceed with the calculation:\n$$I^2 = \\frac{Q - df}{Q} = \\frac{12.5 - 5}{12.5}$$\n$$I^2 = \\frac{7.5}{12.5}$$\nTo express this as a decimal, we perform the division:\n$$I^2 = 0.6$$\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures. Therefore, the result is $0.6000$.\n\nFinally, for the interpretation, an $I^2$ value of $0.6000$ indicates that approximately $60\\%$ of the total variation observed in the effect estimates (log-risk ratios) across the $6$ RCTs is attributable to genuine heterogeneity between studies, rather than to random sampling error. While this value is often interpreted using conventional thresholds—for example, the Cochrane Collaboration suggests categories such as low ($25\\%$), moderate ($50\\%$), and high ($75\\%$) heterogeneity—it is critical to recognize that these thresholds are arbitrary rules of thumb. An $I^2$ of $60\\%$ would typically be classified as moderate-to-substantial heterogeneity, suggesting that a fixed-effect model, which assumes homogeneity, may not be appropriate and a random-effects model should be considered.

This indicates that a substantial majority of the total variation in effect estimates is due to true heterogeneity rather than sampling error. The source of this heterogeneity is clearly Study $6$, with its much larger effect estimate ($\\hat{\\theta}_6=0.40$) compared to the others, which are clustered in the range $[0.09, 0.15]$.\n\nAfter removing Study $6$, the analysis of the remaining five studies shows a dramatic change. The new heterogeneity statistic $Q'$ is approximately $0.78$ on $4$ degrees of freedom. This value is much smaller than its expected value under the null hypothesis of homogeneity (which is $df'=4$). Consequently, the calculated $I^2$ value is $0$. This indicates that the observed variability among the first five studies is entirely consistent with what would be expected from sampling error alone. The removal of the single outlier study has resolved all evidence of heterogeneity, transforming the assessment from \"substantial\" to \"none\".", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "4927541"}]}
