It also requires an explanation of the equivalence between using pre-computed $q$-values and applying the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure directly.\n\nLet $m$ be the total number of independent hypothesis tests. We are given $m=15$.\nLet the ordered $p$-values from these tests be $p_{(1)} \\le p_{(2)} \\le \\dots \\le p_{(m)}$.

If such a $k$ exists, reject the null hypotheses corresponding to $p_{(1)}, p_{(2)}, \\dots, p_{(k)}$.\n\nThe problem defines the $q$-value for a test as the minimal FDR level at which that test would be declared significant. For the $i$-th ordered test, its $q$-value, denoted $q_{(i)}$, is the smallest $\\alpha$ for which the test is rejected. Following the BH procedure, the test corresponding to $p_{(i)}$ is rejected if there exists some index $j \\ge i$ such that $p_{(j)} \\le \\frac{j}{m}\\alpha$. This is equivalent to $\\alpha \\ge \\frac{m \\cdot p_{(j)}}{j}$. To find the minimum $\\alpha$ that allows rejection of the $i$-th test, we must find the minimum of these thresholds for all possible rejection sets that include the $i$-th test. This leads to the definition of the BH-adjusted $p$-value, which is the $q$-value in this context:\n$$q_{(i)} = \\min_{j=i, \\dots, m} \\left( \\frac{m \\cdot p_{(j)}}{j} \\right)$$\nThis definition ensures that the resulting $q$-values are monotonically non-decreasing, i.e., $q_{(1)} \\le q_{(2)} \\le \\dots \\le q_{(m)}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the intermediate values $v_i = \\frac{m \\cdot p_{(i)}}{i}$ for $i=1, \\dots, 15$.\n$v_1 = \\frac{15}{1}(0.0008) = 0.012$\n$v_2 = \\frac{15}{2}(0.003) = 0.0225$\n$v_3 = \\frac{15}{3}(0.0065) = 0.0325$\n$v_4 = \\frac{15}{4}(0.012) = 0.045$\n$v_5 = \\frac{15}{5}(0.018) = 0.054$\n$v_6 = \\frac{15}{6}(0.021) = 0.0525$\n$v_7 = \\frac{15}{7}(0.044) = \\frac{0.66}{7} \\approx 0.094286$\n$v_8 = \\frac{15}{8}(0.051) = 0.095625$\n$v_9 = \\frac{15}{9}(0.062) = \\frac{0.93}{9} \\approx 0.103333$\n$v_{10} = \\frac{15}{10}(0.078) = 0.117$\n$v_{11} = \\frac{15}{11}(0.13) = \\frac{1.95}{11} \\approx 0.177273$\n$v_{12} = \\frac{15}{12}(0.21) = 0.2625$\n$v_{13} = \\frac{15}{13}(0.27) = \\frac{4.05}{13} \\approx 0.311538$\n$v_{14} = \\frac{15}{14}(0.38) = \\frac{5.7}{14} \\approx 0.407143$\n$v_{15} = \\frac{15}{15}(0.49) = 0.49$\n\nNext, we compute the $q$-values by taking the cumulative minimum from right to left (from $i=m$ down to $1$): $q_{(i)} = \\min(v_i, q_{(i+1)})$, with $q_{(m)} = v_m$.\n$q_{(15)} = v_{15} = 0.49$\n$q_{(14)} = \\min(v_{14}, q_{(15)}) = \\min(0.4071..., 0.49) = 0.4071... = \\frac{57}{140}$\n$q_{(13)} = \\min(v_{13}, q_{(14)}) = \\min(0.3115..., 0.4071...) = 0.3115... = \\frac{81}{260}$\n$q_{(12)} = \\min(v_{12}, q_{(13)}) = \\min(0.2625, 0.3115...) = 0.2625$\n$q_{(11)} = \\min(v_{11}, q_{(12)}) = \\min(0.1772..., 0.2625) = 0.1772... = \\frac{39}{220}$\n$q_{(10)} = \\min(v_{10}, q_{(11)}) = \\min(0.117, 0.1772...) = 0.117$\n$q_{(9)} = \\min(v_9, q_{(10)}) = \\min(0.1033..., 0.117) = 0.1033... = \\frac{31}{300}$\n$q_{(8)} = \\min(v_8, q_{(9)}) = \\min(0.095625, 0.1033...) = 0.095625$\n$q_{(7)} = \\min(v_7, q_{(8)}) = \\min(0.0942..., 0.095625) = 0.0942... = \\frac{33}{350}$\n$q_{(6)} = \\min(v_6, q_{(7)}) = \\min(0.0525, 0.0942...) = 0.0525$\n$q_{(5)} = \\min(v_5, q_{(6)}) = \\min(0.054, 0.0525) = 0.0525$\n$q_{(4)} = \\min(v_4, q_{(5)}) = \\min(0.045, 0.0525) = 0.045$\n$q_{(3)} = \\min(v_3, q_{(4)}) = \\min(0.0325, 0.045) = 0.0325$\n$q_{(2)} = \\min(v_2, q_{(3)}) = \\min(0.0225, 0.0325) = 0.0225$\n$q_{(1)} = \\min(v_1, q_{(2)}) = \\min(0.012, 0.0225) = 0.012$\n\nThe resulting vector of $q$-values is:\n$q_{(1)}=0.012$, $q_{(2)}=0.0225$, $q_{(3)}=0.0325$, $q_{(4)}=0.045$, $q_{(5)}=0.0525$, $q_{(6)}=0.0525$, $q_{(7)} \\approx 0.0943$, $q_{(8)}=0.095625$, $q_{(9)} \\approx 0.1033$, $q_{(10)}=0.117$, $q_{(11)} \\approx 0.1773$, $q_{(12)}=0.2625$, $q_{(13)} \\approx 0.3115$, $q_{(14)} \\approx 0.4071$, $q_{(15)}=0.49$.\n\nTo select discoveries at the target level $q^{\\star}=0.09$, we reject all hypotheses for which $q_{(i)} \\le q^{\\star}$.\n$q_{(1)} = 0.012 \\le 0.09$ (Reject)\n$q_{(2)} = 0.0225 \\le 0.09$ (Reject)\n$q_{(3)} = 0.0325 \\le 0.09$ (Reject)\n$q_{(4)} = 0.045 \\le 0.09$ (Reject)\n$q_{(5)} = 0.0525 \\le 0.09$ (Reject)\n$q_{(6)} = 0.0525 \\le 0.09$ (Reject)\n$q_{(7)} = \\frac{33}{350} \\approx 0.0943 > 0.09$ (Do not reject)\nSince the $q$-values are non-decreasing, all subsequent tests from $i=7$ to $i=15$ will also not be rejected. The total number of discoveries is $6$.\n\nNext, we explain why this is equivalent to applying the BH procedure at level $\\alpha = q^{\\star}=0.09$.\nApplying the BH procedure directly, we seek the largest $k$ such that $p_{(k)} \\le \\frac{k}{m}q^{\\star} = \\frac{k}{15}(0.09) = 0.006k$.\nFor $k=1: p_{(1)}=0.0008 \\le 0.006(1)=0.006$ (True)\nFor $k=2: p_{(2)}=0.003 \\le 0.006(2)=0.012$ (True)\nFor $k=3: p_{(3)}=0.0065 \\le 0.006(3)=0.018$ (True)\nFor $k=4: p_{(4)}=0.012 \\le 0.006(4)=0.024$ (True)\nFor $k=5: p_{(5)}=0.018 \\le 0.006(5)=0.030$ (True)\nFor $k=6: p_{(6)}=0.021 \\le 0.006(6)=0.036$ (True)\nFor $k=7: p_{(7)}=0.044 \\le 0.006(7)=0.042$ (False)\nThe largest $k$ satisfying the condition is $k=6$. The BH procedure rejects the first $6$ hypotheses, which matches the result from the $q$-value method.\n\nThe formal explanation for this equivalence is as follows.\nLet $q^{\\star}$ be the desired FDR level.\nMethod 1 (q-value rule): Reject all hypotheses $H_{(i)}$ for which $q_{(i)} \\le q^{\\star}$. Let $k_q = \\max\\{i: q_{(i)} \\le q^{\\star}\\}$. Since $q_{(i)}$ is non-decreasing, the rejected set is $\\{H_{(1)}, \\dots, H_{(k_q)}\\}$.\nMethod 2 (BH procedure): Find $k_{BH} = \\max\\{i: p_{(i)} \\le \\frac{i}{m}q^{\\star}\\}$. The rejected set is $\\{H_{(1)}, \\dots, H_{(k_{BH})}\\}$.\nWe must show that $k_q = k_{BH}$.\n\nFirst, let's show $q_{(k_{BH})} \\le q^{\\star}$. By definition of $k_{BH}$, we have $p_{(k_{BH})} \\le \\frac{k_{BH}}{m}q^{\\star}$, which implies $\\frac{m \\cdot p_{(k_{BH})}}{k_{BH}} \\le q^{\\star}$.\nThe $q$-value is $q_{(k_{BH})} = \\min_{j=k_{BH}, \\dots, m} \\left(\\frac{m \\cdot p_{(j)}}{j}\\right)$.\nSince one of the terms in the minimization (the one for $j=k_{BH}$) is less than or equal to $q^{\\star}$, the minimum itself must be less than or equal to $q^{\\star}$. Thus, $q_{(k_{BH})} \\le q^{\\star}$.\nBy the $q$-value rule, hypothesis $H_{(k_{BH})}$ is rejected. As the $q$-values are non-decreasing, all $H_{(i)}$ for $i \\le k_{BH}$ are also rejected. This implies $k_q \\ge k_{BH}$.\n\nNext, let's examine $q_{(k_{BH}+1)}$. By the definition of $k_{BH}$ as the maximum index, for any $j > k_{BH}$, we must have $p_{(j)} > \\frac{j}{m}q^{\\star}$, which is equivalent to $\\frac{m \\cdot p_{(j)}}{j} > q^{\\star}$.\nThe $q$-value is $q_{(k_{BH}+1)} = \\min_{j=k_{BH}+1, \\dots, m} \\left(\\frac{m \\cdot p_{(j)}}{j}\\right)$.\nSince every term in this minimization is strictly greater than $q^{\\star}$, the minimum itself must be strictly greater than $q^{\\star}$. So, $q_{(k_{BH}+1)} > q^{\\star}$.\nBy the $q$-value rule, hypothesis $H_{(k_{BH}+1)}$ is not rejected. This implies that the largest index of a rejected hypothesis is $k_{BH}$, so $k_q \\le k_{BH}$.\n\nCombining $k_q \\ge k_{BH}$ and $k_q \\le k_{BH}$, we conclude that $k_q = k_{BH}$.

Before committing to a specific $q$, she wants to diagnose the evidence for signal and the proportion of true null hypotheses $\\pi_{0}$ using plots that are interpretable from first principles.\n\nShe considers two diagnostics:\n- A $p$-value histogram over $[0,1]$ to assess deviations from the null expectation that $p$-values from true null hypotheses are independent and uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$.\n- A BH line plot that graphs the ordered $p$-values $p_{(1)} \\le \\cdots \\le p_{(m)}$ against the rank proportion $i/m$, with an overlaid reference line that marks the BH decision boundary for level $q$. Points lying beneath the reference line are candidates for rejection under BH.\n\nFrom a fundamental base, recall that under a true null hypothesis and valid $p$-values, for any $t \\in [0,1]$ the distribution satisfies $\\Pr(p \\le t) = t$, so $p$-values are uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$. When alternatives are present, the marginal $p$-value histogram is a mixture of a uniform component from true nulls and a stochastically smaller component from non-nulls, often yielding an excess of small $p$-values near $0$. The BH procedure is a step-up method that compares ordered $p$-values to a rank-dependent boundary determined by $q$ and $m$; under independence or certain positive dependence structures, it controls the FDR at or below $q$.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describe how these diagnostics can be used to assess $\\pi_{0}$ and the presence of signal, and how deviations from uniformity inform expectations for BH discoveries?\n\nA. In the absence of signal with $\\pi_{0} = 1$ and independent, valid $p$-values, the $p$-value histogram should be approximately flat over $[0,1]$, and on the BH line plot at any $q \\in (0,1)$ one should expect few or no points to fall below the BH reference line, implying few or no rejections.\n\nB. A strong left-skew in the $p$-value histogram (a pronounced excess near $0$ with near-uniform counts over moderate to large $p$-values) is consistent with $\\pi_{0} < 1$ and typically predicts that the BH line plot will show early crossings beneath the BH reference line, producing many discoveries even at modest $q$.\n\nC. A deficit of $p$-values near $1$ alone is sufficient evidence of many true alternatives and guarantees that the BH procedure at any $q \\in (0,1)$ makes at least $\\lfloor m q \\rfloor$ rejections.\n\nD. If the $p$-value histogram is bimodal with modes near $0$ and near $0.5$, this necessarily implies dependence among tests that invalidates BH FDR control, so the BH line plot is not informative.\n\nE. When $\\pi_{0} < 1$ but the non-null $p$-values are only mildly informative (e.g., they cluster around $0.2$ to $0.4$ rather than near $0$), the BH procedure at small $q$ may still yield few rejections, and the BH line plot will often show $p_{(i)}$ remaining above the BH reference line except perhaps for the very smallest ranks.", "solution": "We begin from core definitions and well-tested facts appropriate to multiple testing in biostatistics.\n\nUnder valid $p$-values for true null hypotheses, uniformity holds: for $t \\in [0,1]$, $\\Pr(p \\le t) = t$, implying a flat histogram over $[0,1]$ in large samples. In a mixture with a proportion $\\pi_{0}$ of true nulls and $(1 - \\pi_{0})$ of alternatives, the marginal $p$-value distribution can be written schematically as $f(p) = \\pi_{0} \\cdot 1_{[0,1]}(p) + (1 - \\pi_{0}) \\cdot g(p)$, where $g(p)$ is stochastically smaller than uniform when tests have power. This typically produces an excess of small $p$-values near $0$ when signal exists, while the right tail can remain close to uniform if many nulls are present.\n\nThe Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for false discovery rate (FDR) control sorts the $p$-values and finds the largest index $k$ for which $p_{(k)}$ is not larger than a rank-dependent boundary; it rejects hypotheses with ranks $i \\le k$. Under independence or certain positive dependence (positive regression dependency on a subset), BH controls the FDR at or below level $q$. The diagnostic BH line plot overlays the ordered $p$-values $p_{(i)}$ against $i/m$ and a reference boundary for level $q$; early points lying beneath the reference boundary indicate potential rejections.\n\nA useful heuristic links the ordered $p$-values under pure nulls to uniform order statistics: $E[p_{(i)}] \\approx i/(m+1)$ when all $m$ hypotheses are true nulls. Comparing these to the BH boundary for $q \\in (0,1)$ shows that without signal, crossings are rare; thus, the expected number of rejections is near $0$.\n\nWe now analyze each option:\n\nA. Under $\\pi_{0} = 1$ and independence, the $p$-value histogram should be approximately flat over $[0,1]$, reflecting uniformity. For the BH line plot, consider the uniform order statistics: $E[p_{(i)}] \\approx i/(m+1)$. The BH reference boundary for level $q \\in (0,1)$ scales with rank proportion $i/m$; to have systematic crossings, the ordered $p$-values would need to be systematically smaller than this boundary. Under pure null uniformity, typical values satisfy $p_{(i)}$ around $i/(m+1)$, not smaller than a boundary proportional to $i/m$ unless $q$ is very large (near $1$). Therefore, in the absence of signal and for $q < 1$, few or no points usually lie beneath the BH reference line, and BH makes few or no rejections. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. A strong left-skew in the $p$-value histogram—excess mass near $0$—is classic evidence of $(1 - \\pi_{0}) > 0$ (non-null hypotheses with power), because non-null $p$-values are stochastically smaller than uniform. On the BH line plot, many small $p_{(i)}$ among the smallest ranks push the empirical curve downward, increasing the chance that early ordered $p$-values fall beneath the BH reference boundary. This yields more discoveries even at modest $q$ (e.g., $q$ near $0.05$ or $0.10$). Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. A deficit near $1$ alone is not sufficient evidence for many true alternatives; such a pattern can arise from conservative $p$-values, discrete test statistics, rounding, or other artifacts, and it does not necessarily imply small $p$-values concentrated near $0$. Moreover, BH does not guarantee at least $\\lfloor m q \\rfloor$ rejections; under pure nulls, as argued via uniform order statistics, BH commonly makes $0$ rejections for $q \\in (0,1)$. Therefore, the claimed guarantee is false, and the premise is inadequate. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. Bimodality with modes near $0$ and near $0.5$ can arise from a mixture of nulls (uniform) and alternatives with modest power (generating a mode near $0$) and, for example, specific effect size distributions or discrete $p$-values. It does not necessarily imply dependence among tests or invalidate BH FDR control. BH control is valid under independence and certain positive dependence structures; a bimodal histogram is not, by itself, evidence that these conditions are violated. The BH line plot remains informative regardless, as it visualizes how ordered $p$-values compare to the BH boundary. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. If $\\pi_{0} < 1$ but non-null $p$-values are only mildly informative (e.g., clustering around $0.2$ to $0.4$ rather than near $0$), then even at small $q$ (e.g., $q$ near $0.05$), the BH boundary at small ranks is very low, and many $p_{(i)}$ in the $0.2$ to $0.4$ range will lie above it. Only the very smallest ranks might cross beneath the boundary, resulting in few rejections. This diagnostic behavior appears both in the $p$-value histogram (lack of very small $p$-values) and in the BH line plot (limited early crossings). Verdict: Correct.\n\nIn summary, options A, B, and E correctly relate diagnostic plots to $\\pi_{0}$, signal presence, and BH expectations; options C and D are incorrect for the reasons stated.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABE}$$", "id": "4930961"}]}
