A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nLet the training dataset be $D = \\{(\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^4$, where the feature vectors $\\mathbf{x}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ and class labels $y_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. The four data points are:\n-   $(\\mathbf{x}_1, y_1) = ((0,0), 1)$\n-   $(\\mathbf{x}_2, y_2) = ((1,1), 1)$\n-   $(\\mathbf{x}_3, y_3) = ((0,1), 0)$\n-   $(\\mathbf{x}_4, y_4) = ((1,0), 0)$\nThe total number of observations is $N=4$. The empirical misclassification rate is the number of misclassified points divided by $N$. A single-split tree partitions the feature space into two regions, $R_L$ and $R_R$, based on a predicate. Points in each region are assigned the majority class label of that region.\n\n**(i) Analysis of Axis-Aligned Splits**\n\nAn axis-aligned split is defined by a predicate of the form $x_j \\leq s$, where $j \\in \\{1, 2\\}$. This corresponds to a vertical or horizontal line in the feature space.\n\nLet's consider a split on feature $x_1$ with a threshold $s$. The data points have $x_1$ coordinates of $0$ and $1$. The only non-trivial splits occur for thresholds $s$ between $0$ and $1$, i.e., $s \\in [0, 1)$. For any such $s$, for instance $s=0.5$, the split line $x_1 = s$ partitions the data as follows:\n-   Region $R_L$ (where $x_1 \\leq s$): Contains points $(0,0)$ (class $1$) and $(0,1)$ (class $0$).\n-   Region $R_R$ (where $x_1 > s$): Contains points $(1,0)$ (class $0$) and $(1,1)$ (class $1$).\n\nIn region $R_L$, there is one point of class $1$ and one point of class $0$. The counts are $N_{L,1}=1$ and $N_{L,0}=1$. A majority vote is ambiguous. Any deterministic tie-breaking rule (e.g., assigning the label of the smaller class index, which is class $0$) will result in one misclassification. For example, if we assign label $0$ to $R_L$, the point $(0,0)$ is misclassified. The number of misclassifications in $R_L$ is $1$.\n\nSimilarly, in region $R_R$, there is one point of class $1$ and one point of class $0$. The counts are $N_{R,1}=1$ and $N_{R,0}=1$. Again, the majority vote will lead to one misclassification in this region. The number of misclassifications in $R_R$ is $1$.\n\nThe total number of misclassifications for any such axis-aligned split on $x_1$ is $1 + 1 = 2$. The empirical misclassification rate is $\\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nBy symmetry, a split on feature $x_2$ with a threshold $s \\in [0, 1)$ will also result in two mixed-class nodes, each containing one point of class $1$ and one of class $0$, leading to a total of $2$ misclassifications and a rate of $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSplits with thresholds outside the range of the data (e.g., $s < 0$ or $s \\ge 1$ for a split on $x_1$) place all four points into a single region. This region contains two points of class $1$ and two points of class $0$. Any majority-vote label will misclassify two points, yielding a rate of $\\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, no axis-aligned split can achieve zero empirical misclassification. The minimal misclassification rate for an axis-aligned split is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n**(ii) Analysis of Oblique Splits**\n\nAn oblique split is defined by a predicate of the form $a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 \\leq t$. This corresponds to a line with arbitrary orientation.\n\nFirst, we determine if a rate of $0$ is achievable. A misclassification rate of $0$ implies that the data points of class $1$ can be perfectly separated from the data points of class $0$ by a single line. This property is known as linear separability. Two finite sets of points are linearly separable if and only if their convex hulls are disjoint.\n-   The convex hull of the class $1$ points, $\\text{conv}(\\{(0,0), (1,1)\\})$, is the line segment connecting $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$.\n-   The convex hull of the class $0$ points, $\\text{conv}(\\{(0,1), (1,0)\\})$, is the line segment connecting $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$.\nThese two line segments intersect at the point $(0.5, 0.5)$. Since the convex hulls are not disjoint, the classes are not linearly separable. Consequently, no oblique split can achieve a misclassification rate of $0$.\n\nSince a rate of $0$ is impossible, the minimal possible non-zero rate for a dataset of size $N=4$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$ (corresponding to $1$ misclassified point). We now investigate if this rate is achievable. To achieve exactly one misclassification, we need to find a split that creates terminal nodes such that the sum of misclassified points within them is $1$.\n\nConsider a partition of the four data points into a set of size $1$ and a set of size $3$. Such a partition can be achieved by an oblique split that isolates a single data point. Let's construct a split that isolates the point $(0,0)$ (class $1$).\nConsider the predicate $x_1 + x_2 \\leq c$ for some small positive constant $c$, say $c=0.1$.\n-   For $(0,0)$: $0+0 = 0 \\leq 0.1$. This point is in region $R_L$.\n-   For $(1,0)$: $1+0 = 1 > 0.1$. This point is in region $R_R$.\n-   For $(0,1)$: $0+1 = 1 > 0.1$. This point is in region $R_R$.\n-   For $(1,1)$: $1+1 = 2 > 0.1$. This point is in region $R_R$.\n\nThe split partitions the data as follows:\n-   Region $R_L$ ($x_1+x_2 \\leq 0.1$): Contains only the point $(0,0)$ (class $1$). This node is pure. The majority vote label is $1$. The number of misclassifications in $R_L$ is $0$.\n-   Region $R_R$ ($x_1+x_2 > 0.1$): Contains the remaining three points: $(1,0)$ (class $0$), $(0,1)$ (class $0$), and $(1,1)$ (class $1$). In this region, there are two points of class $0$ and one point of class $1$. The majority class is $0$. The assigned label for $R_R$ is $0$. The point $(1,1)$ is misclassified. The number of misclassifications in $R_R$ is $1$.\n\nThe total number of misclassifications for this oblique split is $0 + 1 = 1$.\nThe empirical misclassification rate is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nSince we have shown that a rate of $0$ is impossible and a rate of $\\frac{1}{4}$ is achievable, the minimal empirical misclassification rate for an oblique split must be $\\frac{1}{4}$. Any other partition type, such as dividing the points into two groups of two, would result in a higher misclassification rate of $\\frac{1}{2}$ as shown in the axis-aligned case.\n\nThe final answer is the minimal rate achievable, which is $\\frac{1}{4}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$$", "id": "4962677"}, {"introduction": "Growing a tree to its maximum depth often leads to overfitting, where the model learns the training data's noise rather than its underlying signal.
