The model is a simplified representation of the human spine, which is a common and valid approach in introductory ergonomics and biomechanics to analyze spinal loading.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem uses fundamental principles of physics (statics, specifically $\\Sigma M = 0$ and $\\Sigma F = 0$). The biological concepts, such as muscle moment arms and co-contraction, are standard in the field. The given values are physically and anatomically plausible.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary data and explicitly states the simplifying assumptions, leaving no ambiguity in what to include in the calculation. The objective is clearly defined, leading to a unique solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language.\n- **Verdict:** The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 3: Solution\nThe problem requires us to calculate the total compressive load on the L5/S1 vertebral joint under the given conditions. This load is the sum of the direct weight component and the force generated by the back extensor muscles.\n\nFirst, we calculate the external flexion moment, $M_{box}$, produced by the box about the L5/S1 joint. The force exerted by the box is its weight, $W_{box}$.\n$$W_{box} = m \\cdot g$$\nThis force acts at a distance $d_{box}$ from the pivot point (L5/S1). The moment is therefore:\n$$M_{box} = W_{box} \\cdot d_{box} = m \\cdot g \\cdot d_{box}$$\n\nFor the system to be in static equilibrium, the sum of moments about the L5/S1 joint must be zero. The external flexion moment from the box must be counteracted by an internal extension moment, $M_{muscle}$, generated by the back extensor muscles.\n$$\\sum M_{L5/S1} = 0 \\implies M_{muscle} - M_{box} = 0$$\n$$M_{muscle} = M_{box}$$\nThe muscle moment is the product of the muscle force, $F_{muscle}$, and its moment arm, $d_{muscle}$. The minimum force required for equilibrium, $F_{muscle, min}$, is found when the moments are exactly balanced.\n$$F_{muscle, min} \\cdot d_{muscle} = M_{box}$$\nSolving for the minimum muscle force:\n$$F_{muscle, min} = \\frac{M_{box}}{d_{muscle}} = \\frac{m \\cdot g \\cdot d_{box}}{d_{muscle}}$$\n\nThe problem states that due to co-contraction, the actual extensor muscle force, $F_{muscle, actual}$, is $30\\%$ greater than this minimum force. A $30\\%$ increase corresponds to multiplying by a factor of $1 + 0.30 = 1.30$.\n$$F_{muscle, actual} = 1.30 \\cdot F_{muscle, min} = 1.30 \\left( \\frac{m \\cdot g \\cdot d_{box}}{d_{muscle}} \\right)$$\n\nAccording to the stated assumptions, the total compressive load at L5/S1, $F_{compressive}$, is the sum of two axial forces: the actual muscle force, $F_{muscle, actual}$, and the vertical component of the box's weight, $W_{box}$. We neglect the weight of the upper body and other factors.\n$$F_{compressive} = F_{muscle, actual} + W_{box}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $F_{muscle, actual}$ and $W_{box}$:\n$$F_{compressive} = 1.30 \\left( \\frac{m \\cdot g \\cdot d_{box}}{d_{muscle}} \\right) + m \\cdot g$$\nWe can factor out $m \\cdot g$:\n$$F_{compressive} = m \\cdot g \\left( 1.30 \\frac{d_{box}}{d_{muscle}} + 1 \\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$m = 20\\ \\text{kg}$\n$g = 9.81\\ \\text{m/s}^{2}$\n$d_{box} = 0.40\\ \\text{m}$\n$d_{muscle} = 0.06\\ \\text{m}$\n\n$$F_{compressive} = (20\\ \\text{kg}) \\cdot (9.81\\ \\text{m/s}^2) \\left( 1.30 \\frac{0.40\\ \\text{m}}{0.06\\ \\text{m}} + 1 \\right)$$\n$$F_{compressive} = 196.2\\ \\text{N} \\left( 1.30 \\cdot \\frac{20}{3} + 1 \\right)$$\n$$F_{compressive} = 196.2\\ \\text{N} \\left( \\frac{26}{3} + 1 \\right)$$\n$$F_{compressive} = 196.2\\ \\text{N} \\left( \\frac{29}{3} \\right)$$\n$$F_{compressive} \\approx 196.2 \\cdot 9.666... \\approx 1896.6\\ \\text{N}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$F_{compressive} \\approx 1900\\ \\text{N}$$\nThe first three significant digits are $1$, $9$, and $0$. The fourth digit is $6$, so we round up the third digit ($0$) to $1$. However, the calculation is $1896.6$. Rounding to three significant figures: the first three are $1, 8, 9$. The fourth digit is $6$, so we round the $9$ up. This carries over, making the result $190$. To maintain the correct magnitude, we add a zero, yielding $1900$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1900}$$", "id": "4524112"}, {"introduction": "Moving from biomechanical principles to proactive design, this exercise focuses on a common office environment.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of ergonomics, a discipline within preventive medicine. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution without contradiction or ambiguity.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the recommended desk surface height above the seat pan, which we will denote as $H_{desk}$. The calculation must adhere to the ergonomic principles and physical dimensions provided.\n\nLet us define the variables based on the problem statement. All heights are measured vertically from the top of the seat pan.\n- $H_{elbow}$: The user's seated elbow height. Given as $H_{elbow} = 26\\ \\mathrm{cm}$.\n- $T_{kb}$: The keyboard thickness, from the desk surface to the top of the home-row keycaps.

Given as $C_{palm} = 2\\ \\mathrm{cm}$.\n- $H_{keys}$: The height of the top of the home-row keycaps above the seat pan.\n- $H_{desk}$: The height of the desk surface above the seat pan. This is the value to be determined.\n\nThe fundamental ergonomic principle cited is the maintenance of a neutral wrist posture, where the forearm is horizontal and the wrist is aligned straight (neither flexed nor extended). The elbow is at height $H_{elbow}$.\n\nThe problem states that to accommodate a palm rest without forcing wrist extension, a vertical clearance of $C_{palm} = 2\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ is required below the elbow level. This instruction sets the height of the surface that supports the palm. Let us denote this palm support height as $H_{support}$. This height is relative to the seat pan.\n$$H_{support} = H_{elbow} - C_{palm}$$\n\nFor the wrist to be in a neutral, straight alignment while typing, the surface on which the fingers rest (the top of the keycaps) should be at the same effective height as the surface supporting the palm. Therefore, the required height of the top of the keycaps, $H_{keys}$, must be equal to $H_{support}$.\n$$H_{keys} = H_{support}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $H_{support}$, we find the target height for the top of the keycaps:\n$$H_{keys} = H_{elbow} - C_{palm}$$\n\nThe height of the keycaps, $H_{keys}$, is also geometrically determined by the height of the desk, $H_{desk}$, and the thickness of the keyboard, $T_{kb}$. The keyboard rests on the desk, so the height of the keycaps is the sum of the desk height and the keyboard thickness.\n$$H_{keys} = H_{desk} + T_{kb}$$\n\nWe now have two expressions for $H_{keys}$. By equating them, we establish a relationship that allows us to solve for the unknown variable, $H_{desk}$.\n$$H_{desk} + T_{kb} = H_{elbow} - C_{palm}$$\n\nSolving this equation for $H_{desk}$ yields:\n$$H_{desk} = H_{elbow} - C_{palm} - T_{kb}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this symbolic equation:\n- $H_{elbow} = 26\\ \\mathrm{cm}$\n- $C_{palm} = 2\\ \\mathrm{cm}$\n- $T_{kb} = 3\\ \\mathrm{cm}$\n\n$$H_{desk} = 26\\ \\mathrm{cm} - 2\\ \\mathrm{cm} - 3\\ \\mathrm{cm}$$\nPerforming the subtraction:\n$$H_{desk} = 24\\ \\mathrm{cm} - 3\\ \\mathrm{cm}$$\n$$H_{desk} = 21\\ \\mathrm{cm}$$\n\nThus, the recommended desk surface height above the seat pan is $21\\ \\mathrm{cm}$.
