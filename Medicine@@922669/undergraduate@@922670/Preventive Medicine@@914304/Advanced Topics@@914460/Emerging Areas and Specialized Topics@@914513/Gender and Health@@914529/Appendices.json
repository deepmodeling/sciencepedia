The concepts are based on fundamental principles of probability and statistics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data ($n$ and $x$ for each stratum and gender) and a clear definition of the quantity to be calculated and the method to be used (direct standardization to the pooled population).

Let $G$ denote gender, where $G=1$ for male and $G=0$ for female.
