These are fundamental measures in assessing interventions in preventive medicine and clinical trials. The provided values are plausible for a respiratory virus vaccine. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient information to calculate the requested quantities. The definitions for the terms are standard and lead to a unique solution.\n-   **Objective:** The language is quantitative, precise, and free of subjective or biased content.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet $R_U$ denote the risk of infection in the unvaccinated population and $R_V$ denote the risk of infection in the vaccinated population. The risk is a probability and will be represented as a number between $0$ and $1$ for calculations.\n\nFrom the problem statement, the givens are:\n-   Risk in unvaccinated: $R_U = 5\\% = 0.05$\n-   Relative Risk Reduction: $RRR = 60\\% = 0.60$\n\nThe Relative Risk Reduction ($RRR$) is defined as the proportional reduction in risk between the unvaccinated and vaccinated groups. The formula is:\n$$ RRR = \\frac{R_U - R_V}{R_U} $$\nThis can also be expressed in terms of the Risk Ratio ($RR$), where $RR = \\frac{R_V}{R_U}$:\n$$ RRR = 1 - \\frac{R_V}{R_U} = 1 - RR $$\n\nFirst, we must derive the risk in the vaccinated group, $R_V$. We can rearrange the formula for $RRR$ to solve for $R_V$:\n$$ RRR = 1 - \\frac{R_V}{R_U} $$\n$$ \\frac{R_V}{R_U} = 1 - RRR $$\n$$ R_V = R_U \\times (1 - RRR) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ R_V = 0.05 \\times (1 - 0.60) $$\n$$ R_V = 0.05 \\times 0.40 $$\n$$ R_V = 0.02 $$\nThus, the risk of infection in the vaccinated group is $2\\%$.\n\nNext, we derive the Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$). The $ARR$ is the simple arithmetic difference in risk between the unvaccinated and vaccinated groups. The formula is:\n$$ ARR = R_U - R_V $$\nSubstituting the value of $R_U$ and the derived value of $R_V$:\n$$ ARR = 0.05 - 0.02 $$\n$$ ARR = 0.03 $$\nThe absolute risk reduction is $0.03$, or $3\\%$.\n\n### Public Health Explanation\nIn the context of this vaccination program, it is crucial for a public health audience to understand the distinct information conveyed by relative versus absolute risk reduction.\n\nThe **relative risk reduction ($RRR$)**, reported here as $60\\%$, describes the vaccine's efficacy from an individual's perspective. It means that a vaccinated person has a $60\\%$ lower risk of getting infected *compared to an unvaccinated person*. This measure is a statement about the proportional effectiveness of the vaccine itself and is generally independent of how widespread the virus is at any given moment. It answers the question: \"How much does this vaccine protect me personally, relative to no protection?\"\n\nThe **absolute risk reduction ($ARR$)**, which we calculated to be $3\\%$ (or $0.03$), describes the vaccine's impact on a population level. In this scenario, it means that for every $100$ people vaccinated, we can expect to prevent $3$ infections that would otherwise have occurred. The $ARR$ is highly dependent on the baseline risk in the unvaccinated community ($R_U = 5\\%$). If the virus were more widespread (e.g., $R_U = 20\\%$), the same vaccine with a $60\\%$ $RRR$ would yield a much larger $ARR$ of $12\\%$. Conversely, if the virus were nearly gone (e.g., $R_U = 0.1\\%$), the $ARR$ would be a tiny $0.06\\%$. The $ARR$ helps public health officials make resource allocation decisions by answering the question: \"What is the tangible, overall benefit of our vaccination campaign in the current epidemiological situation?\" Another way to interpret the $ARR$ is by calculating the Number Needed to Vaccinate ($NNV$), which is $1/ARR$. Here, $NNV = 1/0.03 \\approx 33.33$, meaning we must vaccinate approximately $34$ individuals to prevent one infection. This provides a clear, concrete measure of public health impact.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.03}\n$$", "id": "4589918"}, {"introduction": "Beyond describing risk reduction, public health officials must make resource allocation decisions based on tangible population-level impact. The Number Needed to Vaccinate ($NNV$) is a powerful metric that quantifies the effort required to prevent one adverse outcome, such as a hospitalization. This practice problem bridges the gap between a vaccine's efficacy ($VE$) and practical program planning by guiding you through the calculation of the $NNV$, synthesizing infection risk, disease severity, and efficacy into a single, interpretable metric for decision-making. [@problem_id:4589904]", "problem": "A regional health department is planning a vaccination campaign against a seasonal respiratory virus. For the upcoming season, modeling for unvaccinated individuals estimates a probability of infection of $0.20$. Conditional on infection, the risk of hospitalization (the Infection Hospitalization Ratio) is $0.05$. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, the Vaccine Efficacy (VE) against hospitalization (defined as one minus the relative risk of hospitalization in vaccinated versus unvaccinated groups) was estimated to be $0.50$, and you may assume the trial estimate applies to the target population and time period.\n\nStarting only from core definitions in preventive medicine, proceed as follows:\n- Let $p_{U}$ denote the season-long risk of hospitalization in the unvaccinated group, and let $p_{V}$ denote the corresponding risk in the vaccinated group.\n- Recall that relative risk is defined as $RR = p_{V}/p_{U}$ and that Vaccine Efficacy (VE) against hospitalization is defined as $\\mathrm{VE} = 1 - RR$.\n- Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) is defined as the absolute difference in risk between unvaccinated and vaccinated groups for the outcome of interest.\n\nUsing these definitions, first derive an expression for the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) in terms of the unvaccinated hospitalization risk $p_{U}$ and the Vaccine Efficacy $\\mathrm{VE}$. Then compute the Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNV), defined as the number of individuals who must be vaccinated to avert one hospitalization on average over the season.

The solution proceeds in three main steps: first, calculating the baseline risk of hospitalization in the unvaccinated population; second, deriving a general expression for Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) in terms of baseline risk and Vaccine Efficacy (VE); and third, computing the NNV using the derived values.\n\nLet $P(\\text{Inf}_U)$ be the probability of infection for an unvaccinated individual, and let $P(\\text{Hosp}|\\text{Inf})$ be the conditional probability of hospitalization given an infection (the Infection Hospitalization Ratio). The problem provides these values as:\n$$ P(\\text{Inf}_U) = 0.20 $$\n$$ P(\\text{Hosp}|\\text{Inf}) = 0.05 $$\nThe problem defines $p_U$ as the season-long risk of hospitalization in the unvaccinated group. This risk is the joint probability of an unvaccinated individual becoming infected and subsequently being hospitalized. Assuming these are sequential events, we can calculate $p_U$ as the product of the two probabilities:\n$$ p_U = P(\\text{Inf}_U) \\times P(\\text{Hosp}|\\text{Inf}) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ p_U = 0.20 \\times 0.05 = 0.01 $$\n\nNext, we derive an expression for the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) in terms of the unvaccinated hospitalization risk $p_U$ and the Vaccine Efficacy $\\mathrm{VE}$. The problem provides the following definitions:\nThe risk of hospitalization in the vaccinated group is $p_V$.\nThe Relative Risk is $RR = \\frac{p_V}{p_U}$.\nVaccine Efficacy is $\\mathrm{VE} = 1 - RR$.\nAbsolute Risk Reduction is $ARR = p_U - p_V$.\n\nWe start with the definition of $\\mathrm{VE}$ and substitute the definition of $RR$:\n$$ \\mathrm{VE} = 1 - \\frac{p_V}{p_U} $$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the risk in the vaccinated group, $p_V$, in terms of the risk in the unvaccinated group, $p_U$, and the vaccine efficacy, $\\mathrm{VE}$:\n$$ \\frac{p_V}{p_U} = 1 - \\mathrm{VE} $$\n$$ p_V = p_U (1 - \\mathrm{VE}) $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $p_V$ into the definition of ARR:\n$$ ARR = p_U - p_V = p_U - p_U (1 - \\mathrm{VE}) $$\nDistributing the $p_U$ term:\n$$ ARR = p_U - p_U + p_U \\cdot \\mathrm{VE} $$\nThis simplifies to the desired expression for ARR:\n$$ ARR = p_U \\cdot \\mathrm{VE} $$\nThis result shows that the absolute reduction in risk is the baseline risk in the unvaccinated group multiplied by the efficacy of the vaccine.\n\nFinally, we compute the Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNV). The NNV is defined as the reciprocal of the ARR:\n$$ \\mathrm{NNV} = \\frac{1}{ARR} $$\nUsing our derived expression for ARR:\n$$ \\mathrm{NNV} = \\frac{1}{p_U \\cdot \\mathrm{VE}} $$\nWe have already calculated $p_U = 0.01$. The problem provides the Vaccine Efficacy against hospitalization as $\\mathrm{VE} = 0.50$.\nFirst, we calculate the numerical value of the ARR:\n$$ ARR = 0.01 \\times 0.50 = 0.005 $$\nNow we can calculate the NNV:\n$$ \\mathrm{NNV} = \\frac{1}{0.005} $$\nTo simplify the fraction:\n$$ \\mathrm{NNV} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{5}{1000}} = \\frac{1000}{5} = 200 $$\nTherefore, the Number Needed to Vaccinate to avert one hospitalization is $200$.
