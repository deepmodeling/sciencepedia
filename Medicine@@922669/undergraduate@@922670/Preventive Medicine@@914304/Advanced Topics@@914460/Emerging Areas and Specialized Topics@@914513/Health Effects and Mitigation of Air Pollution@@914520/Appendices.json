Assume the following scientific base:\n\n- Relative risk (RR) models capture how the hazard of death changes multiplicatively with exposure relative to a counterfactual.

The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution.\n\n### Task 1: Derivation of the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF)\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the fundamental definitions of risk and relative risk. Let $h(x)$ be the hazard (instantaneous risk) of death for an individual with exposure level $x$. Let $x^{*}$ be the counterfactual exposure level, at which the hazard is the baseline hazard, $h_0$. The relative risk $RR(x)$ for an exposure $x$ relative to the counterfactual $x^{*}$ is defined as the ratio of the hazards:\n$$RR(x) = \\frac{h(x)}{h(x^{*})} = \\frac{h(x)}{h_0}$$\nTherefore, the hazard at exposure $x$ can be expressed as $h(x) = h_0 \\cdot RR(x)$.\n\nThe population is partitioned into $k$ discrete groups, where group $i$ comprises a proportion $p_i$ of the total population and has a uniform exposure level $x_i$. The total population size is $P$. The number of individuals in group $i$ is $p_i P$.\nThe number of deaths, $N_i$, occurring in group $i$ over a given period is proportional to the size of the group and its associated hazard. We can write this as:\n$$N_i = C \\cdot p_i \\cdot h(x_i)$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of proportionality that incorporates the total population size $P$ and the time interval (one year).\nSubstituting the expression for $h(x_i)$:\n$$N_i = C \\cdot p_i \\cdot (h_0 \\cdot RR(x_i))$$\nThe total observed number of deaths, $N$, is the sum of deaths across all exposure groups:\n$$N = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} N_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} C \\cdot p_i \\cdot h_0 \\cdot RR(x_i) = C \\cdot h_0 \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i RR(x_i)$$\n\nNext, we consider the counterfactual scenario. In this scenario, every individual in the population is exposed to the counterfactual level $x^{*}$. The relative risk for every individual becomes $RR(x^{*}) = 1$, and their hazard is $h(x^{*}) = h_0$. The number of deaths in group $i$ under this counterfactual condition, $N_{i,cf}$, would be:\n$$N_{i,cf} = C \\cdot p_i \\cdot h(x^{*}) = C \\cdot p_i \\cdot h_0$$\nThe total number of deaths in the counterfactual scenario, $N_{cf}$, is the sum across all groups:\n$$N_{cf} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} N_{i,cf} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} C \\cdot p_i \\cdot h_0 = C \\cdot h_0 \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i$$\nSince the proportions must sum to unity, $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i = 1$, we have:\n$$N_{cf} = C \\cdot h_0$$\n\nThe number of attributable deaths, $AD$, is defined as the number of observed deaths that would have been prevented if the population exposure had been at the counterfactual level. This is the difference between observed and counterfactual deaths:\n$$AD = N - N_{cf}$$\nThe Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) is defined as the proportion of observed deaths that are attributable to the exposure, i.e., $AD$ as a fraction of $N$:\n$$\\mathrm{PAF} = \\frac{AD}{N} = \\frac{N - N_{cf}}{N} = 1 - \\frac{N_{cf}}{N}$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $N$ and $N_{cf}$:\n$$\\mathrm{PAF} = 1 - \\frac{C \\cdot h_0}{C \\cdot h_0 \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i RR(x_i)} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i RR(x_i)}$$\nThe denominator, $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i RR(x_i)$, represents the population-weighted average relative risk, which we may denote as $\\overline{RR}$. The expression for PAF is thus:\n$$\\mathrm{PAF} = \\frac{\\overline{RR} - 1}{\\overline{RR}}$$\nGiven the specified log-linear relative risk function, $RR(x) = \\exp(\\beta[x - x^{*}])$, the final derived expression for the PAF is:\n$$\\mathrm{PAF} = \\frac{\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i \\exp(\\beta[x_i - x^{*}])\\right) - 1}{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i \\exp(\\beta[x_i - x^{*}])}$$\nThis completes the derivation as requested.\n\n### Task 2: Calculation of Attributable Deaths\n\nThe calculation proceeds in several steps, using the data provided.\n\nFirst, we calculate the parameter $\\beta$ from the given relative risk per $10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{m}^{3}$ increase in PM$_{2.5}$, $\\mathrm{RR}_{10} = 1.06$.\nThe definition of $\\beta$ is given as $\\beta = \\frac{\\ln(\\mathrm{RR}_{10})}{10}$.\n$$\\beta = \\frac{\\ln(1.06)}{10} \\approx 0.0058268908 \\ (\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{m}^{3})^{-1}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the average relative risk for the population, $\\overline{RR}$, using the exposure distribution $\\{p_i, x_i\\}$ and the counterfactual level $x^{*} = 5$. The city has $3$ groups:\n- Group $1$: $p_1 = 0.5$, $x_1 = 12$\n- Group $2$: $p_2 = 0.3$, $x_2 = 20$\n- Group $3$: $p_3 = 0.2$, $x_3 = 35$\n\nThe relative risk for each group $i$ is $RR(x_i) = \\exp(\\beta[x_i - 5])$.\n$$RR(x_1) = \\exp(\\beta[12 - 5]) = \\exp(7\\beta)$$\n$$RR(x_2) = \\exp(\\beta[20 - 5]) = \\exp(15\\beta)$$\n$$RR(x_3) = \\exp(\\beta[35 - 5]) = \\exp(30\\beta)$$\n\nNow we compute $\\overline{RR} = p_1 RR(x_1) + p_2 RR(x_2) + p_3 RR(x_3)$:\n$$\\overline{RR} = 0.5 \\exp(7\\beta) + 0.3 \\exp(15\\beta) + 0.2 \\exp(30\\beta)$$\nSubstituting the value of $\\beta$:\n$7\\beta \\approx 7 \\times 0.0058268908 \\approx 0.0407882356$\n$15\\beta \\approx 15 \\times 0.0058268908 \\approx 0.087403362$\n$30\\beta \\approx 30 \\times 0.0058268908 \\approx 0.174806724$\n\n$$RR(x_1) \\approx \\exp(0.0407882356) \\approx 1.041632$$\n$$RR(x_2) \\approx \\exp(0.087403362) \\approx 1.091334$$\n$$RR(x_3) \\approx \\exp(0.174806724) \\approx 1.191024$$\n\n$$\\overline{RR} \\approx (0.5 \\times 1.041632) + (0.3 \\times 1.091334) + (0.2 \\times 1.191024)$$\n$$\\overline{RR} \\approx 0.520816 + 0.327400 + 0.238205 = 1.086421$$\n\nUsing this, we calculate the PAF:\n$$\\mathrm{PAF} = \\frac{\\overline{RR} - 1}{\\overline{RR}} \\approx \\frac{1.086421 - 1}{1.086421} = \\frac{0.086421}{1.086421} \\approx 0.079549$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the annual attributable deaths, $AD$, using the total observed annual deaths, $N = 12,000$.\n$$AD = N \\times \\mathrm{PAF} \\approx 12,000 \\times 0.079549 \\approx 954.588$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the number of attributable deaths is $955$.\n\n### Task 3: Justification of Assumptions for Transferring $\\beta$\n\nTransferring an exposure-response parameter such as $\\beta$ from a meta-analysis to a specific local population for a health impact assessment requires the assumption of transportability. This rests on the comparability of several key factors, two of which are exposure metrics and pollutant mixture.\n\n1.  **Comparability of Exposure Metrics**: The validity of applying the meta-analyzed $\\beta$ value assumes that the PM$_{2.5}$ exposure metric used in the original epidemiological studies is equivalent to the metric used for the target city. The problem specifies \"annual mean ambient PM$_{2.5}$ concentration\" for both, which supports comparability. However, this assumes that the methods of measurement (e.g., ground-based monitors, satellite-derived estimates, land-use regression models) and their associated measurement errors are similar. If the spatial and temporal resolution of exposure assessment differs significantly, it could introduce bias. For instance, if the original studies used central-site monitors that poorly represent personal exposure, while the city study uses high-resolution modeling, the transferred $\\beta$ may not accurately reflect the true local risk.\n\n2.  **Comparability of Pollutant Mixture**: PM$_{2.5}$ is a heterogeneous mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets with varying chemical composition (e.g., sulfates, nitrates, black carbon, organic matter, metals, crustal material). The toxicity of PM$_{2.5}$ is believed to depend on its composition, which is in turn determined by emission sources (e.g., traffic, industry, biomass burning). The meta-analyzed $\\beta$ represents an average effect across the various PM$_{2.5}$ mixtures present in the locations of the contributing studies. Transferring this $\\beta$ to the city is justifiable only under the assumption that the toxicity of the city's specific PM$_{2.5}$ mixture is not substantially different from the average toxicity in the source studies. If the city's air pollution is dominated by sources emitting particularly potent components (e.g., certain heavy metals or combustion-related polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) or, conversely, less toxic components (e.g., mineral dust or sea salt), the true local $\\beta$ could be significantly higher or lower, and the application of the meta-analytic average would be a source of uncertainty.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{955}$$", "id": "4531592"}, {"introduction": "Identifying a health problem is only the first step; implementing effective and efficient solutions is the core challenge of public health practice.

Its present value, $PV(C_m)$, is calculated as:\n$$ PV(C_m) = \\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\frac{C_m}{(1+r)^t} = C_m \\left[ \\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-N}}{r} \\right] $$\nSubstituting the given values: $C_m = \\$150{,}000$, $N=5$, and $r=0.03$.\n$$ PV(C_m) = \\$150{,}000 \\left[ \\frac{1 - (1+0.03)^{-5}}{0.03} \\right] $$\n$$ PV(C_m) = \\$150{,}000 \\left[ \\frac{1 - (1.03)^{-5}}{0.03} \\right] \\approx \\$150{,}000 \\times 4.579707 \\approx \\$686{,}956.08 $$\nThe total discounted cost, $\\Delta C$, is the sum of the present values of the upfront and maintenance costs.\n$$ \\Delta C = PV(C_0) + PV(C_m) \\approx \\$1{,}800{,}000 + \\$686{,}956.08 = \\$2{,}486{,}956.08 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the total discounted incremental effects, $\\Delta E$, measured in QALYs.\nThe program is projected to yield a total of $100$ undiscounted QALYs over $5$ years at full uptake. Since the gains accrue evenly, the annual undiscounted QALY gain at full uptake is:\n$$ Q_{\\text{full annual}} = \\frac{100 \\text{ QALYs}}{5 \\text{ years}} = 20 \\text{ QALYs/year} $$\nHowever, the realistic implementation is expected to achieve an uptake of $U=0.80$. The actual annual undiscounted QALY gain, $Q_a$, is therefore:\n$$ Q_a = Q_{\\text{full annual}} \\times U = 20 \\times 0.80 = 16 \\text{ QALYs/year} $$\nThese QALYs are gained at the end of each year for $N=5$ years. To find the total discounted effect, $\\Delta E$, we calculate the present value of this annuity of QALYs using the discount rate $r=0.03$.\n$$ \\Delta E = \\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\frac{Q_a}{(1+r)^t} = Q_a \\left[ \\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-N}}{r} \\right] $$\nSubstituting the values: $Q_a = 16$, $N=5$, and $r=0.03$.\n$$ \\Delta E = 16 \\left[ \\frac{1 - (1.03)^{-5}}{0.03} \\right] \\approx 16 \\times 4.579707 \\approx 73.275315 \\text{ QALYs} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the ICER by dividing the total discounted costs by the total discounted QALYs.\n$$ \\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} \\approx \\frac{\\$2{,}486{,}956.08}{73.275315 \\text{ QALYs}} \\approx \\$33{,}939.78 \\text{ per QALY} $$\n\nThe problem asks to determine whether the ICER is below the stated willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $\\$100{,}000$ per QALY.\n$$ \\$33{,}939.78 < \\$100{,}000 $$\nThe calculated ICER is substantially below the WTP threshold, indicating that the HEPA filtration program is considered a cost-effective intervention under the given assumptions.\n\nThe final numeric answer must be the ICER value rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\text{ICER} \\approx 33{,}939.78 \\rightarrow 33{,}940 $$\nExpressed in scientific notation to make the number of significant figures unambiguous, this is $3.394 \\times 10^4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.394 \\times 10^4}$$", "id": "4531654"}]}
