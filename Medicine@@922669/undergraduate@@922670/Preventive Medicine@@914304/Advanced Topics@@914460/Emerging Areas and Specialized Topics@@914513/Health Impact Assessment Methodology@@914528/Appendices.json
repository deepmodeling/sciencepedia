This process is a standard epidemiological method to compare rates between populations with different underlying age structures, thereby removing the confounding effect of age.\n\nFirst, we define the methodology for direct age standardization. Let the population be stratified into $k$ age groups, indexed by $i = 1, 2, \\dots, k$. For each neighborhood, we first calculate the age-specific hospitalization rate for each stratum.
