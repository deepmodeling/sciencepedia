This practice explores the mathematical foundation of risk-stratified screening, a core component of this new paradigm.

The Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is defined as $PPV = P(D \\mid T^{+})$.

No rounding is required, and no units are needed for the final expression.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of probability theory and epidemiology, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is entirely objective.\n\nThe first task is to derive an algebraic expression for the Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$) in terms of disease prevalence $P(D)$, sensitivity ($Se$), and specificity ($Sp$). We begin with the definition of $PPV$:\n$$PPV = P(D \\mid T^{+})$$\nwhere $D$ is the event of having the disease and $T^{+}$ is the event of a positive test result.\n\nUsing Bayes' rule, we can express this conditional probability as:\n$$P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+} \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^{+})}$$\n\nThe terms in the numerator are given or directly related to the given quantities. $P(T^{+} \\mid D)$ is the definition of sensitivity, $Se$. $P(D)$ is the prevalence of the disease. So, the numerator is $Se \\cdot P(D)$.\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^{+})$, is the overall probability of a positive test result. We can expand this term using the law of total probability, conditioning on whether an individual has the disease ($D$) or not ($\\overline{D}$):\n$$P(T^{+}) = P(T^{+} \\mid D) P(D) + P(T^{+} \\mid \\overline{D}) P(\\overline{D})$$\n\nWe can substitute the known quantities into this expression:\n1. $P(T^{+} \\mid D) = Se$ (Sensitivity).\n2. $P(D)$ is the prevalence.\n3. $P(\\overline{D}) = 1 - P(D)$, as $\\overline{D}$ is the complement of $D$.\n4. $P(T^{+} \\mid \\overline{D})$ must be derived from specificity, $Sp$. Specificity is defined as $Sp = P(T^{-} \\mid \\overline{D})$, where $T^{-}$ is a negative test result. Since the test is binary, for a person without the disease, the test can only be positive or negative. Therefore, $P(T^{+} \\mid \\overline{D}) + P(T^{-} \\mid \\overline{D}) = 1$. This gives us $P(T^{+} \\mid \\overline{D}) = 1 - Sp$. This term is also known as the false positive rate.\n\nSubstituting these components back into the equation for $P(T^{+})$ yields:\n$$P(T^{+}) = Se \\cdot P(D) + (1 - Sp) (1 - P(D))$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for the numerator and the denominator back into the Bayes' rule formula for $PPV$:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot P(D)}{Se \\cdot P(D) + (1 - Sp) (1 - P(D))}$$\nThis is the required expression for $PPV$ as a function of $P(D)$, $Se$, and $Sp$.\n\nThe second task is to compute the derivative $\\frac{d\\,PPV}{d\\,P(D)}$, assuming $Se$ and $Sp$ are fixed constants. For notational convenience, let $p = P(D)$. The expression for $PPV$ becomes:\n$$PPV(p) = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{Se \\cdot p + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)}$$\nTo find the derivative with respect to $p$, we use the quotient rule for differentiation, which states that for a function $f(p) = \\frac{u(p)}{v(p)}$, the derivative is $f'(p) = \\frac{u'(p)v(p) - u(p)v'(p)}{[v(p)]^2}$.\n\nLet us define the numerator and denominator functions:\n- $u(p) = Se \\cdot p$\n- $v(p) = Se \\cdot p + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)$\n\nFirst, we find their derivatives with respect to $p$:\n- $u'(p) = \\frac{d}{dp}(Se \\cdot p) = Se$\n- To find $v'(p)$, we can first expand $v(p)$:\n  $v(p) = Se \\cdot p + 1 - p - Sp + Sp \\cdot p = (Se + Sp - 1)p + (1 - Sp)$\n  Then, the derivative is:\n  $v'(p) = \\frac{d}{dp}((Se + Sp - 1)p + (1 - Sp)) = Se + Sp - 1$\n\nNow, we apply the quotient rule:\n$$\\frac{d(PPV)}{dp} = \\frac{u'(p)v(p) - u(p)v'(p)}{[v(p)]^2}$$\n$$\\frac{d(PPV)}{dp} = \\frac{(Se)[Se \\cdot p + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)] - (Se \\cdot p)(Se + Sp - 1)}{[Se \\cdot p + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)]^2}$$\n\nLet's simplify the numerator:\nNumerator $= Se \\cdot [Se \\cdot p + (1 - Sp)(1-p)] - Se \\cdot p \\cdot (Se + Sp - 1)$\nNumerator $= Se^2 \\cdot p + Se(1 - Sp)(1-p) - Se^2 \\cdot p - Se \\cdot Sp \\cdot p + Se \\cdot p$\nNumerator $= Se(1 - Sp)(1 - p) - Se \\cdot Sp \\cdot p + Se \\cdot p$\nNumerator $= Se(1 - Sp - p + p \\cdot Sp) - Se \\cdot Sp \\cdot p + Se \\cdot p$\nNumerator $= Se - Se \\cdot Sp - Se \\cdot p + Se \\cdot p \\cdot Sp - Se \\cdot Sp \\cdot p + Se \\cdot p$\n\nLet's use the simplified form of $v(p)$ for an easier algebraic manipulation of the numerator:\nNumerator $= u'v - uv'$\nNumerator $= Se \\cdot [(Se + Sp - 1)p + (1 - Sp)] - (Se \\cdot p)(Se + Sp - 1)$\nNumerator $= Se(Se + Sp - 1)p + Se(1 - Sp) - Se(Se + Sp - 1)p$\nThe first and third terms cancel each other out, leaving:\nNumerator $= Se(1 - Sp)$\n\nThe denominator is $[v(p)]^2$.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to derive the adherence-adjusted population-level risk ratio, $RR_{adj}$. We begin by defining the fundamental terms.\n\nLet $R_0$ denote the baseline risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in the control group (standard care).\nLet $R_{int}$ denote the overall risk in the intervention group, which is a mixed population.\n\nThe adherence-adjusted risk ratio is defined as the ratio of the risk in the total intervention group to the risk in the control group:\n$$RR_{adj} = \\frac{R_{int}}{R_0}$$\n\nThe intervention group consists of two distinct subpopulations:\n1. A fraction $a$ of participants who are adherent to the protocol.\n2. A fraction $1-a$ of participants who are non-adherent.\n\nThe risk for the adherent subpopulation, $R_{adherent}$, can be expressed using the given risk ratio, $RR$, for this group:\n$$R_{adherent} = RR \\times R_0$$\n\nThe problem states that the non-adherent participants \"will not materially change their activity levels.\" This implies their risk is identical to the baseline risk of the control group. Therefore, the risk for the non-adherent subpopulation, $R_{non-adherent}$, is:\n$$R_{non-adherent} = R_0$$\nThis is equivalent to stating that the risk ratio for the non-adherent subgroup relative to the control group is $1$.\n\nThe overall risk in the intervention group, $R_{int}$, is the weighted average of the risks of the two subpopulations, where the weights are their respective proportions in the group:\n$$R_{int} = (a \\times R_{adherent}) + ((1-a) \\times R_{non-adherent})$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $R_{adherent}$ and $R_{non-adherent}$:\n$$R_{int} = (a \\times RR \\times R_0) + ((1-a) \\times R_0)$$\n\nWe can factor out the baseline risk, $R_0$:\n$$R_{int} = R_0 \\times (a \\times RR + 1 - a)$$\n\nNow, we can derive the expression for $RR_{adj}$ by substituting this expression for $R_{int}$ into its definition:\n$$RR_{adj} = \\frac{R_0 \\times (a \\times RR + 1 - a)}{R_0}$$\n\nCanceling the $R_0$ term from the numerator and denominator yields the general expression for the adherence-adjusted risk ratio:\n$$RR_{adj} = a \\times RR + 1 - a$$\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $RR_{adj}$ using the given values $RR=0.7$ and $a=0.6$:\n$$RR_{adj} = (0.6) \\times (0.7) + (1 - 0.6)$$\n$$RR_{adj} = 0.42 + 0.4$$\n$$RR_{adj} = 0.82$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The value $0.82$ is written as $0.820$ to meet this requirement.\n\n### Interpretation\nThe derived adherence-adjusted risk ratio, $RR_{adj} = 0.820$, represents the expected risk ratio at the population level when the intervention is deployed, accounting for incomplete adherence. A risk ratio of $1.0$ indicates no difference in risk between the intervention and control groups. The risk ratio of $0.7$ for perfect adherers indicates a $30\\%$ risk reduction. However, because only $60\\%$ of the population adheres, the effect is attenuated. The resulting population-level risk ratio of $0.820$ signifies an average risk reduction of $1 - 0.820 = 0.18$, or $18\\%$, across the entire intervention population compared to standard care.
