This first exercise guides you through a quantitative risk assessment (QRA), a core tool used by public health agencies to estimate the potential harm from chronic exposure to contaminants.

In preventive medicine and public health risk assessment, chronic exposure and lifetime cancer risk are estimated from measured food contamination, consumption patterns, body weight, and an established carcinogenic potency factor. Consider a surveillance dataset for an adult in a setting where the staple foods are maize flour, groundnuts, and sorghum flour. The measured mean concentrations of aflatoxin B1 in these foods are $1.0\\ \\mathrm{\\mu g/kg}$ for maize flour, $5.0\\ \\mathrm{\\mu g/kg}$ for groundnuts, and $2.0\\ \\mathrm{\\mu g/kg}$ for sorghum flour. The individual’s average daily consumption rates are $0.20\\ \\mathrm{kg/day}$ for maize flour, $0.020\\ \\mathrm{kg/day}$ for groundnuts, and $0.10\\ \\mathrm{kg/day}$ for sorghum flour. The individual’s body weight is $70\\ \\mathrm{kg}$. Assume exposure at these levels persists for $30$ years during a $70$-year lifetime. The carcinogenic potency factor for aflatoxin B1 (interpreted as the slope factor for excess lifetime risk per unit lifetime average daily dose) is $0.01\\ (\\mathrm{ng/kg\\text{-}day})^{-1}$.

Express the final risk as a decimal probability with no percent sign, and round your final answer to four significant figures.

The total daily mass intake, $M_{total}$, is the sum of the intakes from all food sources.\n$$ M_{total} = (C_m \\times I_m) + (C_g \\times I_g) + (C_s \\times I_s) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ M_{total} = (1.0\\ \\mathrm{\\mu g/kg} \\times 0.20\\ \\mathrm{kg/day}) + (5.0\\ \\mathrm{\\mu g/kg} \\times 0.020\\ \\mathrm{kg/day}) + (2.0\\ \\mathrm{\\mu g/kg} \\times 0.10\\ \\mathrm{kg/day}) $$\n$$ M_{total} = (0.20 + 0.10 + 0.20)\\ \\mathrm{\\mu g/day} $$\n$$ M_{total} = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{\\mu g/day} $$\n\nStep 2: Convert the total daily mass intake to nanograms per day.\nThe potency factor is given in units involving nanograms (ng), so we must convert $M_{total}$ to these units using the provided conversion factor $U$.\n$$ M_{total, ng} = M_{total} \\times U $$\n$$ M_{total, ng} = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{\\mu g/day} \\times 1000\\ \\mathrm{ng/\\mu g} = 500\\ \\mathrm{ng/day} $$\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Chronic Daily Intake (CDI).\nThe CDI is the daily intake of the contaminant normalized by body weight.
