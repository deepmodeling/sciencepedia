This practice addresses a common pitfall in discussing risk: the use of relative risk figures, which can often be misleading. Here, you will practice the foundational skill of converting a relative risk reduction into an absolute frequency statement, a format proven to enhance patient comprehension and enable more informed choices [@problem_id:4574109].", "problem": "A clinician and patient are engaging in shared decision-making about starting a preventive intervention to reduce the risk of a specific disease over the next year. The patient’s baseline absolute risk of developing the disease is $2\\%$ (that is, a probability of $0.02$ over one year without the intervention). The informational leaflet states that the intervention “reduces risk by $50\\%$.”\n\nUsing core definitions from risk communication in preventive medicine and probability, derive from first principles how to convert a relative risk communication (“reduces risk by $50\\%$”) into an absolute frequency statement suitable for patient decision aids.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of epidemiology and probability theory, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objectively phrased. The problem requires a derivation from first principles, an application of these principles, and an explanation grounded in the established field of risk communication.\n\nThe solution will proceed in three parts as requested: first, a formal derivation of the relevant quantities; second, the application of this derivation to the provided numerical data to generate a natural frequency statement; and third, an explanation of why this format is superior for patient comprehension.\n\nLet us begin by defining the primary quantities in symbolic terms.\nLet $E$ be the event that an individual develops the disease within the specified time frame (one year).\nThe baseline absolute risk, or the risk in the untreated population, is the probability of event $E$ occurring given no intervention. We denote this as $AR_{untreated} = P(E | \\text{untreated})$.\nThe absolute risk in the treated population is the probability of event $E$ occurring given the intervention. We denote this as $AR_{treated} = P(E | \\text{treated})$.\n\nThe problem provides the baseline absolute risk:\n$$AR_{untreated} = 0.02$$\n\nThe problem also provides a statement about the intervention's efficacy: it \"reduces risk by $50\\%$.\" This is a statement of Relative Risk Reduction ($RRR$). The $RRR$ is defined as the proportional reduction in risk in the treated group compared to the untreated group. Mathematically, it is defined as:\n$$RRR = \\frac{AR_{untreated} - AR_{treated}}{AR_{untreated}}$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$RRR = 1 - \\frac{AR_{treated}}{AR_{untreated}}$$\nThe term $\\frac{AR_{treated}}{AR_{untreated}}$ is the Relative Risk ($RR$). Thus, $RRR = 1 - RR$.\n\nFrom the definition of $RRR$, we can derive an expression for the absolute risk in the treated group, $AR_{treated}$.\n$$RRR = 1 - \\frac{AR_{treated}}{AR_{untreated}}$$\n$$AR_{untreated} \\times RRR = AR_{untreated} - AR_{treated}$$\n$$AR_{treated} = AR_{untreated} - (AR_{untreated} \\times RRR)$$\nFactoring out $AR_{untreated}$, we get:\n$$AR_{treated} = AR_{untreated} (1 - RRR)$$\n\nAnother crucial quantity for risk communication is the Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$). This is the absolute difference in risk between the untreated and treated groups. It quantifies how much the intervention reduces the probability of the adverse event in absolute terms.\n$$ARR = AR_{untreated} - AR_{treated}$$\nBy substituting the expression we derived for $AR_{treated}$, we can express $ARR$ in terms of the baseline risk and the relative risk reduction:\n$$ARR = AR_{untreated} - [AR_{untreated} (1 - RRR)]$$\n$$ARR = AR_{untreated} - AR_{untreated} + AR_{untreated} \\times RRR$$\n$$ARR = AR_{untreated} \\times RRR$$\nThis last equation, $ARR = AR_{untreated} \\times RRR$, is the fundamental relationship for converting a relative risk reduction into an absolute risk reduction.\n\nNow, we apply this derivation to the given numerical data.\nThe givens are:\n$AR_{untreated} = 0.02$\n$RRR = 50\\% = 0.50$\n\nFirst, we calculate the absolute risk in the treated group, $AR_{treated}$:\n$$AR_{treated} = AR_{untreated} (1 - RRR) = 0.02 \\times (1 - 0.50) = 0.02 \\times 0.50 = 0.01$$\nNext, we calculate the absolute risk reduction, $ARR$. This is the numerical value requested as the final answer.\n$$ARR = AR_{untreated} - AR_{treated} = 0.02 - 0.01 = 0.01$$\nAlternatively, using the derived formula:\n$$ARR = AR_{untreated} \\times RRR = 0.02 \\times 0.50 = 0.01$$\n\nTo produce a natural frequency statement for a cohort of $100$ individuals, we convert these probabilities into expected counts.\n- **Untreated Group:** The expected number of individuals who will develop the disease out of a cohort of $100$ is $100 \\times AR_{untreated} = 100 \\times 0.02 = 2$.\n- **Treated Group:** The expected number of individuals who will develop the disease out of a cohort of $100$ is $100 \\times AR_{treated} = 100 \\times 0.01 = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the natural frequency statement suitable for a patient decision aid is:\n\"If we have a group of $100$ people like you, we expect that over the next year, $2$ of them will develop the disease if they do not take this intervention. If all $100$ people do take the intervention, we expect that only $1$ of them will develop the disease. This means that for every $100$ people who take the intervention for one year, $1$ person is prevented from developing the disease.\"\n\nFinally, we explain why expressing benefits in this absolute frequency format improves understanding. This is based on established principles in the psychology of risk perception and shared decision-making.\n1.  **Contextualization of Benefit:** Relative risk formats, such as “$50\\%$ risk reduction,” are often misinterpreted by patients because they lack the context of the baseline risk. A $50\\%$ reduction of a large risk (e.g., from $40\\%$ to $20\\%$) is a large absolute benefit ($ARR=0.20$), while a $50\\%$ reduction of a small risk (as in this case, from $2\\%$ to $1\\%$) is a small absolute benefit ($ARR=0.01$). Patients frequently overestimate the magnitude of the benefit when presented only with the relative figure, a cognitive bias known as the \"framing effect.\"\n2.  **Cognitive Ease:** Natural frequencies (e.g., \"$2$ out of $100$\") are more concrete and easier for the human mind to process than abstract probabilities ($0.02$) or percentages ($2\\%$). The use of a common denominator (the cohort of $100$) for both the untreated and treated scenarios creates a clear, side-by-side comparison that transparently illustrates the effect size.\n3.  **Informed Decision-Making:** Shared decision-making requires that the patient understands the potential benefits, harms, and burdens of an intervention in a way that allows them to weigh these factors according to their own values and preferences. Absolute formats provide a realistic and non-exaggerated estimate of the benefit. This allows the patient to make an informed choice, for example, by comparing the benefit (\"preventing $1$ case of the disease per $100$ people treated\") against the potential side effects, cost, or inconvenience of the intervention. Relative risk formats obscure this trade-off, undermining the goal of truly shared and informed decision-making.\nThe absolute risk reduction, $ARR = 0.01$, is the final numerical answer requested.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.01}$$", "id": "4574109"}, {"introduction": "Moving from clear communication to quantifying an intervention's impact, this exercise focuses on calculating key metrics like Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$) and Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$).

It is scientifically grounded in the fundamental principles of epidemiology and biostatistics, specifically the measures of risk and treatment effect used in preventive medicine. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary data ($p_0 = 0.10$, $RR = 0.75$, $T = 10$ years) provided to derive a unique solution for the requested metrics (ARR, RRR, NNT). The problem is objective and uses precise, unambiguous language. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of several key metrics used to quantify the effect of a preventive medication. We are given the following information:\n- The baseline cumulative risk of an event in the untreated population over a time horizon of $T = 10$ years is $p_0 = 0.10$.\n- The relative risk for the event in the treated population compared to the untreated population is $RR = 0.75$.\n\nThe relative risk ($RR$) is defined as the ratio of the risk of an event in the treated group ($p_1$) to the risk of an event in the untreated (control) group ($p_0$).\n$$ RR = \\frac{p_1}{p_0} $$\nWe can use this definition to calculate the risk in the treated group, $p_1$.\n$$ p_1 = RR \\times p_0 $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ p_1 = 0.75 \\times 0.10 = 0.075 $$\nSo, the $10$-year cumulative risk of the event for an individual taking the medication is $0.075$.\n\nNext, we derive the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR). The ARR is the absolute difference in risk between the untreated and treated groups.\n$$ ARR = p_0 - p_1 $$\nUsing the values for $p_0$ and the calculated $p_1$:\n$$ ARR = 0.10 - 0.075 = 0.025 $$\nThe absolute risk reduction over $10$ years is $0.025$.\n\nNow, we derive the Relative Risk Reduction (RRR). The RRR represents the proportion of the baseline risk that is eliminated by the therapy. It can be calculated in two equivalent ways.\nFirst, RRR can be defined in terms of the ARR and the baseline risk $p_0$:\n$$ RRR = \\frac{ARR}{p_0} = \\frac{p_0 - p_1}{p_0} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ RRR = \\frac{0.025}{0.10} = 0.25 $$\nAlternatively, the RRR can be derived directly from the relative risk $RR$:\n$$ RRR = 1 - RR $$\nSubstituting the given value for $RR$:\n$$ RRR = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 $$\nBoth methods yield a consistent relative risk reduction of $0.25$.\n\nFinally, we compute the Number Needed to Treat (NNT). The NNT is the average number of patients who must be treated over the specified time period to prevent one additional adverse outcome. It is the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Reduction.\n$$ NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR} $$\nUsing our calculated value for ARR:\n$$ NNT = \\frac{1}{0.025} = \\frac{1}{1/40} = 40 $$\nThe NNT is $40$. This means that, on average, $40$ people must be treated with the medication for $10$ years to prevent one event. Since this is an integer, no rounding is required.\n\nRegarding the influence of the time horizon on Shared Decision-Making (SDM), it is crucial to recognize that while relative risk reduction ($RRR$) may be constant, the absolute risk reduction ($ARR$) is not. Baseline risk ($p_0$) is a cumulative probability that increases over time; a $5$-year risk is inherently lower than a $10$-year risk for the same condition. Since $ARR = p_0 \\times RRR$, a smaller $p_0$ over a shorter time horizon (e.g., $5$ years) will result in a smaller $ARR$ and consequently a larger $NNT$. For SDM, this is critical because communicating a constant $RRR$ of $25\\%$ can be misleading, whereas comparing the absolute benefit (e.g., an $ARR$ of $0.025$ and $NNT$ of $40$ over $10$ years versus a smaller $ARR$ and larger $NNT$ over $5$ years) provides the patient with a more transparent and intuitive understanding of the magnitude of benefit they can expect over different durations, allowing for a more informed decision when weighing benefits against harms and costs.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{40}$$", "id": "4574157"}, {"introduction": "Truly patient-centered care involves balancing potential benefits against potential harms, guided by the patient's unique values.

The language is objective and precise, with no factual inaccuracies or logical contradictions. The risk values are plausible for a $5$-year primary prevention context.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid and can be solved as stated.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n#### 1. Absolute Risk Reduction and Number Needed to Treat for Cardiovascular Events\n\nThe absolute risk reduction ($ARR$) for major cardiovascular events is the difference between the event rate in the control group and the event rate in the treatment group.\n$$ARR = R_{c,CV} - R_{t,CV}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ARR = 0.100 - 0.082 = 0.018$$\nThis means that for every $100$ patients treated with the medication for $5$ years, approximately $1.8$ major cardiovascular events are prevented.\n\nThe Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$) is the reciprocal of the $ARR$. It represents the average number of patients who must be treated to prevent one additional adverse outcome (in this case, one major cardiovascular event).\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nSubstituting the calculated $ARR$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.018} = \\frac{1000}{18} = \\frac{500}{9} \\approx 55.56$$\n\n#### 2. Absolute Risk Increase and Number Needed to Harm for Diabetes\n\nThe absolute risk increase ($ARI$) for medication-induced new-onset diabetes is the difference between the event rate in the treatment group and the event rate in the control group.\n$$ARI = R_{t,DM} - R_{c,DM}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ARI = 0.048 - 0.040 = 0.008$$\nThis means that for every $100$ patients treated with the medication for $5$ years, approximately $0.8$ additional cases of new-onset diabetes are induced.\n\nThe Number Needed to Harm ($NNH$) is the reciprocal of the $ARI$. It represents the average number of patients who must be treated for one additional harmful outcome (in this case, one case of new-onset diabetes) to occur.\n$$NNH = \\frac{1}{ARI}$$\nSubstituting the calculated $ARI$:\n$$NNH = \\frac{1}{0.008} = \\frac{1000}{8} = 125$$\n\n#### 3. Patient-Preference-Weighted Net Benefit\n\nThe goal is to calculate a single net benefit metric that incorporates both the benefit of preventing cardiovascular events and the harm of inducing diabetes, weighted by the patient's stated preferences. The net benefit is to be expressed as the expected number of \"preference-weighted\" favorable outcomes per $1000$ treated patients.\n\nLet's define the weights based on the patient's preference. The problem directs us to count one prevented major cardiovascular event with a weight of $w_{benefit} = 1$. The patient values preventing a CV event $3$ times as much as avoiding a diabetes case. This implies that avoiding a diabetes case has a value of $1/3$ relative to preventing a CV event. The harm of a caused diabetes case is thus weighted by a magnitude of $w_{harm} = 1/3$.\n\nThe net benefit per patient is the probability of a benefit ($ARR$) multiplied by its weight, minus the probability of a harm ($ARI$) multiplied by its weight:\n$$\\text{Net Benefit per patient} = (ARR \\times w_{benefit}) - (ARI \\times w_{harm})$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\\text{Net Benefit per patient} = (0.018 \\times 1) - (0.008 \\times \\frac{1}{3})$$\n$$\\text{Net Benefit per patient} = 0.018 - \\frac{0.008}{3}$$\nTo express this as a rational number:\n$$\\text{Net Benefit per patient} = \\frac{18}{1000} - \\frac{8}{3000} = \\frac{54}{3000} - \\frac{8}{3000} = \\frac{46}{3000}$$\n\nThe problem asks for this value to be expressed as the expected number of preference-weighted favorable outcomes per $1000$ treated patients. We multiply the net benefit per patient by $1000$:\n$$\\text{Net Benefit per 1000 patients} = 1000 \\times \\text{Net Benefit per patient}$$\n$$\\text{Net Benefit per 1000 patients} = 1000 \\times \\frac{46}{3000} = \\frac{46}{3}$$\nNow, we compute the decimal value:\n$$\\text{Net Benefit per 1000 patients} = 15.3333...$$\n\nThe final step is to round this result to four significant figures.\n$$15.33$$\n\nThis value signifies that for every $1000$ patients treated with the medication for $5$ years, the net expected outcome is equivalent to preventing $15.33$ major cardiovascular events, after accounting for the patient's valuation of the harm from new-onset diabetes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{15.33}$$", "id": "4574154"}]}
