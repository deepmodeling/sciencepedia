Because the crude (unadjusted) cause-specific mortality rate reflects both the underlying risk and the age structure, direct age-standardization is used to compare populations at different stages of this transition. Consider ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality in two hypothetical countries: Country Y (younger age structure) and Country O (older age structure).\n\nYou are given the following age-specific IHD mortality rates (deaths per $100{,}000$ person-years):\n\n- Country Y: $0$–$14$: $5$, $15$–$44$: $20$, $45$–$64$: $120$, $\\geq 65$: $600$.\n- Country O: $0$–$14$: $7$, $15$–$44$: $35$, $45$–$64$: $200$, $\\geq 65$: $800$.\n\nUse the following standard population age composition (proportions that sum to $1$) for direct age-standardization:\n\n- Standard population weights: $0$–$14$: $0.26$, $15$–$44$: $0.43$, $45$–$64$: $0.20$, $\\geq 65$: $0.11$.\n\nFor context, the current age compositions (proportions summing to $1$) of the two countries are:\n\n- Country Y age distribution: $0$–$14$: $0.32$, $15$–$44$: $0.46$, $45$–$64$: $0.16$, $\\geq 65$: $0.06$.\n- Country O age distribution: $0$–$14$: $0.18$, $15$–$44$: $0.40$, $45$–$64$: $0.24$, $\\geq 65$: $0.18$.\n\nTasks:\n1.

It is scientifically grounded in established epidemiological principles, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation. The problem asks for the calculation of age-standardized and crude mortality rates and their interpretation, which is a standard procedure in public health and demography to address the confounding effects of age structure when comparing populations.\n\nThe core task is to compute age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) for two hypothetical countries, Country Y and Country O, and then find the absolute difference between these rates. The ASMR allows for a fair comparison of underlying mortality risk by controlling for differences in the age composition of the populations. The formula for the ASMR is a weighted average of the age-specific mortality rates ($M_i$), where the weights ($W_i^S$) are the proportions of each age group in a standard population.\n\nLet $i$ be the index for the age stratum, with $i=1$ corresponding to age group $0–14$, $i=2$ to $15–44$, $i=3$ to $45–64$, and $i=4$ to $\\geq 65$.\nLet $M_{i,Y}$ and $M_{i,O}$ be the age-specific ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality rates (per $100,000$ person-years) for Country Y and Country O, respectively, in stratum $i$.\nLet $W_i^S$ be the proportion of the standard population in age stratum $i$.\n\nThe data provided are:\nAge-specific mortality rates for Country Y: $M_{1,Y} = 5$, $M_{2,Y} = 20$, $M_{3,Y} = 120$, $M_{4,Y} = 600$.\nAge-specific mortality rates for Country O: $M_{1,O} = 7$, $M_{2,O} = 35$, $M_{3,O} = 200$, $M_{4,O} = 800$.\nStandard population weights: $W_1^S = 0.26$, $W_2^S = 0.43$, $W_3^S = 0.20$, $W_4^S = 0.11$.\n\nThe age-standardized mortality rate, $ASMR$, is calculated as:\n$$ASMR = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} M_i \\cdot W_i^S$$\n\nFirst, we compute the ASMR for Country Y ($ASMR_Y$):\n$$ASMR_Y = (M_{1,Y} \\cdot W_1^S) + (M_{2,Y} \\cdot W_2^S) + (M_{3,Y} \\cdot W_3^S) + (M_{4,Y} \\cdot W_4^S)$$\n$$ASMR_Y = (5 \\cdot 0.26) + (20 \\cdot 0.43) + (120 \\cdot 0.20) + (600 \\cdot 0.11)$$\n$$ASMR_Y = 1.3 + 8.6 + 24.0 + 66.0 = 99.9$$\nThe age-standardized IHD mortality rate for Country Y is $99.9$ deaths per $100,000$ person-years.\n\nNext, we compute the ASMR for Country O ($ASMR_O$):\n$$ASMR_O = (M_{1,O} \\cdot W_1^S) + (M_{2,O} \\cdot W_2^S) + (M_{3,O} \\cdot W_3^S) + (M_{4,O} \\cdot W_4^S)$$\n$$ASMR_O = (7 \\cdot 0.26) + (35 \\cdot 0.43) + (200 \\cdot 0.20) + (800 \\cdot 0.11)$$\n$$ASMR_O = 1.82 + 15.05 + 40.0 + 88.0 = 144.87$$\nThe age-standardized IHD mortality rate for Country O is $144.87$ deaths per $100,000$ person-years.\n\nThe absolute difference between the two age-standardized rates is:\n$$|\\text{Difference}| = |ASMR_O - ASMR_Y| = |144.87 - 99.9| = 44.97$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the value remains $44.97$.\n\nFor the interpretive part of the problem, we must also compute the crude mortality rates (CMR) for each country. The CMR is calculated using each country's own age distribution as weights.\nLet $W_{i,Y}$ and $W_{i,O}$ be the proportions of the populations of Country Y and Country O, respectively, in age stratum $i$.\n\nThe data provided are:\nCountry Y age distribution: $W_{1,Y} = 0.32$, $W_{2,Y} = 0.46$, $W_{3,Y} = 0.16$, $W_{4,Y} = 0.06$.\nCountry O age distribution: $W_{1,O} = 0.18$, $W_{2,O} = 0.40$, $W_{3,O} = 0.24$, $W_{4,O} = 0.18$.\n\nThe crude mortality rate, $CMR$, is calculated as:\n$$CMR = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} M_i \\cdot W_i$$\n\nFirst, we compute the CMR for Country Y ($CMR_Y$):\n$$CMR_Y = (M_{1,Y} \\cdot W_{1,Y}) + (M_{2,Y} \\cdot W_{2,Y}) + (M_{3,Y} \\cdot W_{3,Y}) + (M_{4,Y} \\cdot W_{4,Y})$$\n$$CMR_Y = (5 \\cdot 0.32) + (20 \\cdot 0.46) + (120 \\cdot 0.16) + (600 \\cdot 0.06)$$\n$$CMR_Y = 1.6 + 9.2 + 19.2 + 36.0 = 66.0$$\nThe crude IHD mortality rate for Country Y is $66.0$ deaths per $100,000$ person-years.\n\nNext, we compute the CMR for Country O ($CMR_O$):\n$$CMR_O = (M_{1,O} \\cdot W_{1,O}) + (M_{2,O} \\cdot W_{2,O}) + (M_{3,O} \\cdot W_{3,O}) + (M_{4,O} \\cdot W_{4,O})$$\n$$CMR_O = (7 \\cdot 0.18) + (35 \\cdot 0.40) + (200 \\cdot 0.24) + (800 \\cdot 0.18)$$\n$$CMR_O = 1.26 + 14.0 + 48.0 + 144.0 = 207.26$$\nThe crude IHD mortality rate for Country O is $207.26$ deaths per $100,000$ person-years.\n\nQualitative Explanation:\nThe crude mortality rates are $CMR_Y = 66.0$ and $CMR_O = 207.26$. The crude absolute difference is $|207.26 - 66.0| = 141.26$.\nThe age-standardized mortality rates are $ASMR_Y = 99.9$ and $ASMR_O = 144.87$. The standardized absolute difference is $44.97$.\n\nThe comparison reveals a significant discrepancy. The crude rate comparison suggests that the mortality burden from IHD in Country O is vastly greater than in Country Y. However, the age-standardized comparison shows a much smaller, though still substantial, difference. This disparity is a direct consequence of confounding by age structure. Country O is an \"older\" country, with a larger proportion of its population in the higher age groups where IHD mortality is extremely high (e.g., $18\\%$ of the population is $\\geq 65$, where the rate is $800$ per $100,000$). This amplifies its crude rate. Conversely, Country Y is a \"younger\" country, with a larger proportion of its population in low-mortality age groups (e.g., $32\\%$ is $0-14$, where the rate is $5$ per $100,000$). This depresses its crude rate.\n\nAge-standardization removes this confounding effect by calculating the rate that would be observed if both countries had the same (standard) age structure. The resulting ASMRs provide a more accurate measure of the underlying difference in mortality risk between the two populations, attributable to factors other than age distribution (e.g., lifestyle, healthcare access, genetics). In the context of the epidemiologic transition, as a country ages (like Country O), its crude mortality rate from noncommunicable diseases like IHD will rise dramatically simply due to demographic shifts, even if its age-specific risks remain constant. This makes direct standardization essential for tracking true changes in disease risk over time or between populations at different stages of the transition.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{44.97}\n$$", "id": "4583759"}, {"introduction": "As a population moves through the epidemiologic transition, two opposing forces influence its crude death rate: mortality rates at each age are generally falling, while the population as a whole is aging into higher-risk age groups.

The ultimate goal is to compute a specific ratio of disease burdens in Phase B.\n\nThe foundational formula for DALYs, as simplified in the problem statement (no age-weighting or discounting), is the sum of Years of Life Lost (YLL) and Years Lived with Disability (YLD):\n$$\n\\text{DALY} = \\text{YLL} + \\text{YLD}\n$$\n\nThe components are calculated as follows:\nYears of Life Lost ($\\text{YLL}$) is the product of the number of deaths ($N$) and the standard remaining life expectancy ($L$) at the average age of death.\n$$\n\\text{YLL} = N \\times L\n$$\nYears Lived with Disability ($\\text{YLD}$) is the product of the number of incident cases ($I$), the average duration of the condition in years ($D$), and the disability weight ($DW$).\n$$\n\\text{YLD} = I \\times D \\times DW\n$$\nWe will now compute the DALYs for each category in each phase as stipulated by the first task.\n\n**Phase A Calculations**\n\nFor infectious diseases in Phase A, the given parameters are:\n- Deaths ($N_{A,ID}$): $400$\n- Remaining life expectancy ($L_{A,ID}$): $75$ years\n- Incident cases ($I_{A,ID}$): $12000$\n- Duration ($D_{A,ID}$): $0.08$ years\n- Disability Weight ($DW_{A,ID}$): $0.21$\n\nThe $\\text{YLL}$ for infectious diseases in Phase A is:\n$$\n\\text{YLL}_{A,ID} = N_{A,ID} \\times L_{A,ID} = 400 \\times 75 = 30000\n$$\nThe $\\text{YLD}$ for infectious diseases in Phase A is:\n$$\n\\text{YLD}_{A,ID} = I_{A,ID} \\times D_{A,ID} \\times DW_{A,ID} = 12000 \\times 0.08 \\times 0.21 = 201.6\n$$\nThe total $\\text{DALY}$s for infectious diseases in Phase A are the sum:\n$$\n\\text{DALY}_{A,ID} = \\text{YLL}_{A,ID} + \\text{YLD}_{A,ID} = 30000 + 201.6 = 30201.6\n$$\n\nFor non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Phase A, the given parameters are:\n- Deaths ($N_{A,NCD}$): $300$\n- Remaining life expectancy ($L_{A,NCD}$): $23$ years\n- Incident cases ($I_{A,NCD}$): $2500$\n- Duration ($D_{A,NCD}$): $5$ years\n- Disability Weight ($DW_{A,NCD}$): $0.35$\n\nThe $\\text{YLL}$ for NCDs in Phase A is:\n$$\n\\text{YLL}_{A,NCD} = N_{A,NCD} \\times L_{A,NCD} = 300 \\times 23 = 6900\n$$\nThe $\\text{YLD}$ for NCDs in Phase A is:\n$$\n\\text{YLD}_{A,NCD} = I_{A,NCD} \\times D_{A,NCD} \\times DW_{A,NCD} = 2500 \\times 5 \\times 0.35 = 4375\n$$\nThe total $\\text{DALY}$s for NCDs in Phase A are:\n$$\n\\text{DALY}_{A,NCD} = \\text{YLL}_{A,NCD} + \\text{YLD}_{A,NCD} = 6900 + 4375 = 11275\n$$\n\n**Phase B Calculations**\n\nFor infectious diseases in Phase B, the given parameters are:\n- Deaths ($N_{B,ID}$): $90$\n- Remaining life expectancy ($L_{B,ID}$): $75$ years\n- Incident cases ($I_{B,ID}$): $8000$\n- Duration ($D_{B,ID}$): $0.08$ years\n- Disability Weight ($DW_{B,ID}$): $0.18$\n\nThe $\\text{YLL}$ for infectious diseases in Phase B is:\n$$\n\\text{YLL}_{B,ID} = N_{B,ID} \\times L_{B,ID} = 90 \\times 75 = 6750\n$$\nThe $\\text{YLD}$ for infectious diseases in Phase B is:\n$$\n\\text{YLD}_{B,ID} = I_{B,ID} \\times D_{B,ID} \\times DW_{B,ID} = 8000 \\times 0.08 \\times 0.18 = 115.2\n$$\nThe total $\\text{DALY}$s for infectious diseases in Phase B are:\n$$\n\\text{DALY}_{B,ID} = \\text{YLL}_{B,ID} + \\text{YLD}_{B,ID} = 6750 + 115.2 = 6865.2\n$$\n\nFor non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Phase B, the given parameters are:\n- Deaths ($N_{B,NCD}$): $520$\n- Remaining life expectancy ($L_{B,NCD}$): $21$ years\n- Incident cases ($I_{B,NCD}$): $9000$\n- Duration ($D_{B,NCD}$): $7$ years\n- Disability Weight ($DW_{B,NCD}$): $0.22$\n\nThe $\\text{YLL}$ for NCDs in Phase B is:\n$$\n\\text{YLL}_{B,NCD} = N_{B,NCD} \\times L_{B,NCD} = 520 \\times 21 = 10920\n$$\nThe $\\text{YLD}$ for NCDs in Phase B is:\n$$\n\\text{YLD}_{B,NCD} = I_{B,NCD} \\times D_{B,NCD} \\times DW_{B,NCD} = 9000 \\times 7 \\times 0.22 = 13860\n$$\nThe total $\\text{DALY}$s for NCDs in Phase B are:\n$$\n\\text{DALY}_{B,NCD} = \\text{YLL}_{B,NCD} + \\text{YLD}_{B,NCD} = 10920 + 13860 = 24780\n$$\nThis completes the first task. The second task is interpretative. In Phase A, the burden from infectious diseases ($\\text{DALY}_{A,ID} = 30201.6$) is substantially greater than from NCDs ($\\text{DALY}_{A,NCD} = 11275$). In Phase B, this pattern has inverted, with the burden from NCDs ($\\text{DALY}_{B,NCD} = 24780$) being much larger than from infectious diseases ($\\text{DALY}_{B,ID} = 6865.2$). This shift in the primary source of disease burden is a quantitative illustration of the epidemiologic transition.\n\nThe third task is to compute the ratio $R_B$. It is defined as the ratio of total $\\text{DALY}$s from NCDs to total $\\text{DALY}$s from infectious diseases in Phase B.\n$$\nR_B = \\frac{\\text{DALY}_{B,NCD}}{\\text{DALY}_{B,ID}}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\nR_B = \\frac{24780}{6865.2}\n$$\nPerforming the division yields:\n$$\nR_B \\approx 3.60951610...\n$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $3$, $6$, $0$, and $9$. The fifth digit is $5$, which requires rounding up the fourth digit. Rounding $9$ up results in $10$, so the value becomes $3.610$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.610}$$", "id": "4583808"}]}
