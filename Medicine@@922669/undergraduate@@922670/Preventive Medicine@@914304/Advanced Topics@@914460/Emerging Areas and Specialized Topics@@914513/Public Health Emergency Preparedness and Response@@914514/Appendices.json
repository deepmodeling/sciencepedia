Surveillance data from the origin indicates a point prevalence of active, infectious cases among departing travelers of $p = 0.005$.

It uses standard principles of probability theory (specifically, Bernoulli trials and the binomial distribution framework) to model a common problem in public health epidemiology and emergency preparedness. The concept of modeling case importation risk based on prevalence and travel volume is a standard and valid approach. The assumptions provided (independence, fixed status, perfect screening) are common idealizations used to create a tractable mathematical model, and their explicit statement makes the problem well-defined. The problem is therefore well-posed, as all necessary parameters ($n$, $p$) and conditions (independence) are provided to calculate a unique solution. The language is objective and precise.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet $A$ be the event that at least one infected traveler arrives in the city. The problem asks for the probability of this event, $P(A)$.\n\nThe arrival of each of the $n = 1000$ travelers can be modeled as an independent Bernoulli trial. For each traveler $i$, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $n$, let $I_i$ be the event that traveler $i$ is infected. The problem states that the probability of any given traveler being infected is $p = 0.005$.\n$$P(I_i) = p = 0.005$$\nThe complement event, that traveler $i$ is not infected, is denoted $I_i^c$. The probability of this event is:\n$$P(I_i^c) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.005 = 0.995$$\n\nThe event $A$, \"at least one infected traveler arrives,\" is the union of the events that traveler $1$ is infected, OR traveler $2$ is infected, ..., OR traveler $n$ is infected.\n$$A = I_1 \\cup I_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup I_n$$\nCalculating the probability of a union of many events directly can be complex. It is more straightforward to use the complement rule, as suggested by the problem's direction to use core principles. The complement of event $A$, denoted $A^c$, is the event that *no* infected travelers arrive. This means that traveler $1$ is not infected, AND traveler $2$ is not infected, ..., AND traveler $n$ is not infected.\n$$A^c = I_1^c \\cap I_2^c \\cap \\dots \\cap I_n^c$$\nThe problem states that each traveler's infection status is independent. Therefore, the probability of the intersection of these independent events is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(A^c) = P(I_1^c) \\times P(I_2^c) \\times \\dots \\times P(I_n^c)$$\nSince $P(I_i^c) = 1 - p$ for all travelers, this simplifies to:\n$$P(A^c) = (1 - p) \\times (1 - p) \\times \\dots \\times (1 - p) \\quad (n \\text{ times})$$\n$$P(A^c) = (1 - p)^n$$\nThis is the expression for the probability that no infected travelers arrive.\n\nUsing the complement rule, the probability of event $A$ (at least one infected traveler arriving) is:\n$$P(A) = 1 - P(A^c)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(A^c)$, we arrive at the general formula derived from first principles:\n$$P(A) = 1 - (1 - p)^n$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nFor the second part, we compute the numerical value using the given data: $n = 1000$ and $p = 0.005$.\n$$P(A) = 1 - (1 - 0.005)^{1000}$$\n$$P(A) = 1 - (0.995)^{1000}$$\nNow, we calculate the value of $(0.995)^{1000}$.\n$$(0.995)^{1000} \\approx 0.006700504$$\nSubstituting this value back into the expression for $P(A)$:\n$$P(A) \\approx 1 - 0.006700504$$\n$$P(A) \\approx 0.993299496$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\nThe first significant figure is $9$.\nThe second significant figure is $9$.\nThe third significant figure is $3$.\nThe fourth significant figure is $2$.\nThe fifth digit is $9$, which is $5$ or greater, so we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$P(A) \\approx 0.9933$$\nThis is the final numerical answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9933}$$", "id": "4564365"}, {"introduction": "Once a pathogen is present in a community, rapid and accurate diagnosis is essential for guiding patient care and public health interventions.
