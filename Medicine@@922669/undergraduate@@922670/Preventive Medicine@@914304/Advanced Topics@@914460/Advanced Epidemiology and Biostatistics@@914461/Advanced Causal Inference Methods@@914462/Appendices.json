By the law of iterated expectations, we can condition on the covariates $X$:\n$$ E[Y^{1}] = E_{X}[E[Y^{1} \\mid X]] $$\nBy the assumption of conditional exchangeability, $(Y^{1}, Y^{0}) \\perp T \\mid X$, the expectation of the potential outcome $Y^{1}$ conditional on $X$ is the same regardless of the treatment actually received.
