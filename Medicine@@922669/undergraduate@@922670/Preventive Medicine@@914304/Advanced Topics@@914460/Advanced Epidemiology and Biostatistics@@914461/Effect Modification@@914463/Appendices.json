The RERI is a measure of interaction on the additive scale. It quantifies how much of the excess risk in the doubly exposed group ($A=1, B=1$) is attributable to the interaction of the two exposures, relative to the baseline risk in the unexposed group ($A=0, B=0$).\n\nLet $R_{ab}$ denote the risk of the outcome in the stratum with exposure status $A=a$ and $B=b$, where $a, b \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\nThe provided risks are:\n- $R_{00} = 0.040$ (baseline risk)\n- $R_{10} = 0.060$ (risk with exposure $A$ only)\n- $R_{01} = 0.100$ (risk with exposure $B$ only)\n- $R_{11} = 0.180$ (risk with both exposures)\n\nThe standard definition of RERI is based on risk ratios (RR):\n$$\n\\text{RERI} = RR_{11} - RR_{10} - RR_{01} + 1\n$$\nwhere $RR_{ab}$ is the risk ratio for the stratum $(a,b)$ compared to the baseline stratum $(0,0)$. Specifically:\n- $RR_{10}$ is the risk ratio for exposure $A$ in the absence of $B$: $RR_{10} = \\frac{R_{10}}{R_{00}}$\n- $RR_{01}$ is the risk ratio for exposure $B$ in the absence of $A$: $RR_{01} = \\frac{R_{01}}{R_{00}}$\n- $RR_{11}$ is the risk ratio for exposure to both $A$ and $B$: $RR_{11} = \\frac{R_{11}}{R_{00}}$\n\nFirst, we compute these risk ratios using the given data:\n$$\nRR_{10} = \\frac{0.060}{0.040} = 1.5\n$$\n$$\nRR_{01} = \\frac{0.100}{0.040} = 2.5\n$$\n$$\nRR_{11} = \\frac{0.180}{0.040} = 4.5\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the formula for RERI:\n$$\n\\text{RERI} = 4.5 - 1.5 - 2.5 + 1\n$$\n$$\n\\text{RERI} = 4.5 - (1.5 + 2.5) + 1\n$$\n$$\n\\text{RERI} = 4.5 - 4.0 + 1\n$$\n$$\n\\text{RERI} = 0.5 + 1 = 1.5\n$$\n\nAn alternative, equivalent way to conceptualize and calculate RERI is by first computing the interaction term on the additive scale of absolute risks, denoted as $I$, and then making it relative to the baseline risk $R_{00}$.\nThe interaction $I$ is the observed joint excess risk minus the expected joint excess risk under additivity:\n$I = (R_{11} - R_{00}) - [(R_{10} - R_{00}) + (R_{01} - R_{00})]$\n$I = R_{11} - R_{10} - R_{01} + R_{00}$\n$$\nI = 0.180 - 0.060 - 0.100 + 0.040 = 0.060\n$$\nThen, RERI is this interaction term scaled by the baseline risk:\n$$\n\\text{RERI} = \\frac{I}{R_{00}} = \\frac{R_{11} - R_{10} - R_{01} + R_{00}}{R_{00}} = \\frac{0.060}{0.040} = 1.5\n$$\nBoth methods yield the same result, confirming the calculation.\n\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $1.5$, which expressed to three significant figures is $1.50$.\n\nThe second part of the question is to determine whether the result warrants integrated policy action based on the sign of the RERI.\n- $\\text{RERI} = 0$ implies no interaction on the additive scale (perfect additivity).\n- $\\text{RERI} > 0$ implies a positive interaction, or synergism. The joint effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects.\n- $\\text{RERI} < 0$ implies a negative interaction, or antagonism. The joint effect is less than the sum of the individual effects.\n\nOur calculated value is $\\text{RERI} = 1.5$, which is positive. This indicates a significant synergistic interaction between long-term high traffic-related air pollution and current daily smoking. The excess risk for individuals with both exposures is $1.5$ times the baseline risk greater than what would be expected if the individual excess risks were simply added together. From a public health perspective, such synergism is of high importance. It identifies a subgroup of the population (those exposed to both risk factors) that experiences a disproportionately high risk. This provides a strong rationale for integrated policy actions that address both exposures concurrently or prioritize interventions for dually exposed individuals, as such interventions would be more impactful in reducing the overall burden of disease than separate, uncoordinated actions.\nTherefore, the positive sign of the RERI strongly suggests that the combined exposure warrants integrated policy action.\n\nThe final numerical answer required is the value of RERI.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.50}$$", "id": "4522674"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice shifts focus to the classic definition of effect modification: when the magnitude of an association differs across levels of a third variable.

Assessment of Effect Modification and Appropriateness of Pooling**\n\nEffect modification is defined as a variation in the magnitude of the association across strata. The measure of association here is the risk ratio.\n\n*   The stratum-specific risk ratios are $RR_1 = 2.0$ and $RR_2 = 1.5$.\n*   These values are different. In the younger stratum, smoking is associated with a doubling of the risk. In the older stratum, it is associated with a $50\\%$ increase in risk.\n*   The existence of this difference is the definition of effect modification. When meaningful effect modification is present, a single pooled estimate like $RR_{MH} = 1.62$ is misleading because it averages over and obscures the differing effects in the subgroups. It fails to convey that the effect of smoking on respiratory infection risk is stronger in younger individuals than in older individuals.\n*   Therefore, the scientifically appropriate action is not to pool the results but to report the stratum-specific estimates ($RR_1 = 2.0$ and $RR_2 = 1.5$) to fully describe the phenomenon. Pooling is inappropriate.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A.

While stratification is a method to control for confounding, its use also reveals effect modification. One cannot assume without evidence that the observed differences are merely due to random chance, and the core principle is to report heterogeneity when it is present.\n    *   This option is incorrect. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. The pooled MH effect is approximately $1.83$; pooling is appropriate since the Mantel–Haenszel pooled odds ratio approximates the risk ratio when outcome incidence is low.**\n    *   The problem specifically requests the MH risk ratio, which is $1.62$, not $1.83$. The value $1.83$ corresponds to the MH pooled *odds ratio* ($OR_{MH}$), not the risk ratio.\n    *   The justification for using an OR as an approximation for RR requires the \"rare disease assumption\" (low outcome incidence). Here, incidences range from $5\\%$ ($0.05$) to $30\\%$ ($0.30$), which are not uniformly low enough for the approximation to be accurate.\n    *   The claim that pooling is appropriate is incorrect.\n    *   This option uses the wrong statistical measure and provides faulty reasoning. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. The pooled MH risk ratio is approximately $1.75$; pooling is inappropriate because Simpson’s paradox guarantees reversal of the association when strata are combined.**\n    *   The calculated $RR_{MH}$ is $1.62$, not $1.75$. The value is incorrect.\n    *   Simpson's paradox describes a reversal of the direction of an association upon pooling, which does not occur here. Both stratum-specific RRs ($2.0$ and $1.5$) are greater than $1$, and the crude (unstratified) RR is also greater than $1$ (it is approximately $1.57$). Furthermore, Simpson's paradox is not \"guaranteed\" in any pooling scenario; it is a specific type of confounding effect.\n    *   This option is incorrect. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **E. The pooled MH risk ratio is approximately $1.62$; pooling is appropriate because effect modification enhances generalizability, making a single summary estimate preferable.**\n    *   The calculated $RR_{MH}$ of $1.62$ is correct.\n    *   The reasoning is fundamentally flawed. Effect modification *limits* generalizability, it does not enhance it. It indicates that the effect is not generalizable across the strata of the third variable. Consequently, reporting a single summary estimate is not preferable; it is misleading.\n    *   This option demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of effect modification. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4522642"}]}
