The fpc is a factor used to adjust the variance of an estimator when a sample is drawn from a finite population without replacement. It accounts for the fact that the sampling variation is reduced when the sampling fraction is not negligible. The fpc is defined as:\n$$ \\text{fpc} = 1 - \\frac{n}{N} $$\nThis can also be expressed as $\\frac{N-n}{N}$.

The probability that an eligible child is not captured by the registry is $P(R^c) = 0.12$.\n2.  The probability that an eligible child is captured by the registry is therefore $P(R) = 1 - P(R^c) = 1 - 0.12 = 0.88$.\n3.  The registry-reported coverage is the proportion of vaccinated children among those captured in the registry. This is a conditional probability, which we denote as $p_I = P(V|R)$.
