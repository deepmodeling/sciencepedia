It provides a complete and consistent set of givens, adheres to established scientific principles, and is formulated in precise, objective language. The task is to derive the estimator for an indirect comparison and its corresponding variance, a fundamental procedure in this statistical domain.\n\nThe problem describes a three-treatment network involving treatments $A$, $B$, and $C$. The available evidence consists of direct comparisons between $A$ and $B$, and between $B$ and $C$. There is no direct evidence comparing $A$ and $C$. The goal is to estimate the relative effect of $A$ versus $C$, denoted $d_{AC}$, using the available information.\n\nLet $\\theta_A$, $\\theta_B$, and $\\theta_C$ represent the true mean effects of treatments $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, on an additive scale. The relative treatment effect between any two treatments $X$ and $Y$ is defined as $d_{XY} = \\theta_X - \\theta_Y$.\n\nThe core principle that enables the synthesis of evidence across a network is the consistency assumption. This assumption posits that all treatment effects are coherent and can be mapped onto a single underlying framework defined by the treatment-specific parameters $\\theta_t$. For our three-treatment chain $A-B-C$, the consistency equation relates the direct and indirect effects as follows:\n$$\nd_{AC} = d_{AB} + d_{BC}\n$$\nThis can be shown by substituting the definitions of the relative effects in terms of the absolute effects:\n$$\nd_{AB} + d_{BC} = (\\theta_A - \\theta_B) + (\\theta_B - \\theta_C) = \\theta_A - \\theta_C = d_{AC}\n$$\nThe consistency equation provides the theoretical foundation for estimating $d_{AC}$ indirectly.\n\nWe are given two independent, unbiased estimators for the direct comparisons:\n$1$. $\\hat{d}_{AB}$, an estimator for $d_{AB}$ with variance $v_{AB} = \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{AB})$.\n$2$. $\\hat{d}_{BC}$, an estimator for $d_{BC}$ with variance $v_{BC} = \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{BC})$.\n\nThe unbiasedness implies that $E[\\hat{d}_{AB}] = d_{AB}$ and $E[\\hat{d}_{BC}] = d_{BC}$. The independence implies that their covariance is zero: $\\operatorname{Cov}(\\hat{d}_{AB}, \\hat{d}_{BC}) = 0$.\n\nTo derive the indirect estimator for $d_{AC}$, which we shall denote $\\hat{d}_{AC}$, we use the \"plug-in\" principle based on the consistency equation. We substitute the estimators for the true effects into the equation:\n$$\n\\hat{d}_{AC} = \\hat{d}_{AB} + \\hat{d}_{BC}\n$$\nThis expression provides the point estimate for the indirect comparison of $A$ versus $C$. We can verify that this estimator is unbiased for $d_{AC}$. Using the linearity of the expectation operator:\n$$\nE[\\hat{d}_{AC}] = E[\\hat{d}_{AB} + \\hat{d}_{BC}] = E[\\hat{d}_{AB}] + E[\\hat{d}_{BC}]\n$$\nSubstituting the known expected values:\n$$\nE[\\hat{d}_{AC}] = d_{AB} + d_{BC}\n$$\nBy the consistency equation, $d_{AB} + d_{BC} = d_{AC}$, so we have:\n$$\nE[\\hat{d}_{AC}] = d_{AC}\n$$\nThus, the indirect estimator $\\hat{d}_{AC}$ is an unbiased estimator of the true relative effect $d_{AC}$.\n\nNext, we derive the sampling variance of this indirect estimator, $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{AC})$. The variance of a sum of two random variables is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(X+Y) = \\operatorname{Var}(X) + \\operatorname{Var}(Y) + 2\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)\n$$\nApplying this to our estimator $\\hat{d}_{AC}$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{AC}) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{AB} + \\hat{d}_{BC}) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{AB}) + \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{BC}) + 2\\operatorname{Cov}(\\hat{d}_{AB}, \\hat{d}_{BC})\n$$\nThe problem statement specifies that the evidence for $A$ versus $B$ and $B$ versus $C$ comes from disjoint sets of trials, ensuring that the estimators $\\hat{d}_{AB}$ and $\\hat{d}_{BC}$ are statistically independent. For independent random variables, the covariance is zero.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(\\hat{d}_{AB}, \\hat{d}_{BC}) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this into the variance equation simplifies it to:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{AC}) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{AB}) + \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{BC})\n$$\nFinally, using the provided notation for the variances, $v_{AB} = \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{AB})$ and $v_{BC} = \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{BC})$, we obtain the final expression for the variance of the indirect estimator:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{AC}) = v_{AB} + v_{BC}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that for an indirect comparison, the point estimate is the sum of the constituent direct estimates, and its variance is the sum of their variances, under the assumption of independence.\n\nTherefore, the two quantities requested are the indirect estimator $\\hat{d}_{AC} = \\hat{d}_{AB} + \\hat{d}_{BC}$ and its sampling variance $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{AC}) = v_{AB} + v_{BC}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\hat{d}_{AB} + \\hat{d}_{BC} & v_{AB} + v_{BC} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4977502"}, {"introduction": "In a network meta-analysis, not all evidence comes from simple two-arm trials.

The foundational assumptions are that for a three-arm trial comparing treatments $A$, $B$, and $C$, the arm-level estimators $\\hat{\\mu}_{A}$, $\\hat{\\mu}_{B}$, and $\\hat{\\mu}_{C}$ are statistically uncorrelated, i.e., $\\mathrm{Cov}(\\hat{\\mu}_{t}, \\hat{\\mu}_{s}) = 0$ for $t \\neq s$, and have variances $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\mu}_{t}) = v_{t}$.\n\nThe two contrasts relative to the common reference arm $A$ are defined as:\n$$\n\\hat{d}_{BA} = \\hat{\\mu}_{B} - \\hat{\\mu}_{A}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{d}_{CA} = \\hat{\\mu}_{C} - \\hat{\\mu}_{A}\n$$\n\n**Conceptual Explanation of Correlation**\n\nFrom first principles, two random variables are correlated if they share a common source of random variation. In this case, both $\\hat{d}_{BA}$ and $\\hat{d}_{CA}$ are functions of the same random variable, $\\hat{\\mu}_{A}$. The arm-level estimator $\\hat{\\mu}_{A}$ is subject to sampling error; it is an estimate of the true parameter $\\mu_{A}$ and will deviate from this true value in any given sample.\n\nIf sampling error causes $\\hat{\\mu}_{A}$ to be an overestimate of $\\mu_{A}$, its value is subtracted in the calculation of both $\\hat{d}_{BA}$ and $\\hat{d}_{CA}$. This will cause both $\\hat{d}_{BA}$ and $\\hat{d}_{CA}$ to be systematically smaller than they would be otherwise. Conversely, if $\\hat{\\mu}_{A}$ is an underestimate of $\\mu_{A}$, its smaller value is subtracted, causing both $\\hat{d}_{BA}$ and $\\hat{d}_{CA}$ to be systematically larger. Because a random deviation in $\\hat{\\mu}_{A}$ in one direction simultaneously pushes both $\\hat{d}_{BA}$ and $\\hat{d}_{CA}$ in the opposite direction, the two contrast estimators are not independent; they are, in fact, correlated. The formal measure of this statistical dependence is their covariance, which we expect to be non-zero.\n\n**Derivation of the Covariance Matrix**\n\nThe task is to find the $2 \\times 2$ covariance matrix of the vector of contrasts $\\mathbf{\\hat{d}} = (\\hat{d}_{BA}, \\hat{d}_{CA})^{\\top}$.

The task is to derive the transformation from a log-risk ratio to an absolute risk and then to apply this to compute point estimates and $95\\%$ confidence intervals for the absolute risks of two treatments, A and B.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical foundation. Let $p_k$ be the absolute risk (probability of an event) for a patient receiving treatment $k$, and let $p_c$ be the absolute risk for a patient receiving the standard care or control treatment. The problem provides the baseline risk for the control group as $p_0 = 0.20$, so we identify $p_c = p_0$.\n\nThe Risk Ratio ($RR$) for treatment $k$ relative to the control is defined as the ratio of their risks:\n$$RR_k = \\frac{p_k}{p_c}$$\nThe log-risk ratio, denoted by $\\theta_k$, is the natural logarithm of the risk ratio:\n$$\\theta_k = \\ln(RR_k) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_k}{p_c}\\right)$$\nTo derive the formula for the absolute risk $p_k$ in terms of the log-risk ratio $\\theta_k$ and the baseline risk $p_c$, we solve the above equation for $p_k$.
