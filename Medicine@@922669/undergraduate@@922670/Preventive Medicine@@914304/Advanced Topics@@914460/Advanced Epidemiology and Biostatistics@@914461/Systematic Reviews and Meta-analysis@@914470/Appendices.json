The critical value for $\\chi^2_5$ at a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$ is $11.07$. Since our calculated $Q$ is less than this critical value ($7.078 < 11.07$), the test for heterogeneity is not statistically significant. This result, on its own, would support the use of a fixed-effect model.\n\nThe inconsistency metric is $I^2 \\approx 0.2936$, or $29.36\\%$. This value suggests that approximately $29\\%$ of the variability in the effect estimates is attributable to true between-study heterogeneity rather than random sampling error. This level of heterogeneity is generally considered low to moderate.\n\nThe choice between a fixed-effect model and a random-effects model is informed by these results. While the Q-test is not significant, it is known to have low statistical power, especially with a small number of studies ($k=6$). The $I^2$ value, while not high, indicates the presence of some between-study heterogeneity. A conservative and common approach in modern meta-analysis is to opt for a random-effects model when $I^2 > 0$, as it provides a more cautious estimate by incorporating between-study variance, leading to wider confidence intervals. Therefore, despite the non-significant Q-test, the presence of moderate inconsistency ($I^2 \\approx 29\\%$) provides a reasonable argument for choosing a random-effects model over a fixed-effect model.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n7.078 & 0.2936\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4580654"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of a meta-analysis is to produce a single, summary estimate of an effect by combining results from multiple studies.
