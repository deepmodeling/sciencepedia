It is scientifically grounded in probability theory as applied to biostatistics, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its language. The problem is a standard exercise in calculating expected values and does not contain any of the flaws listed in the validation criteria.\n\nThe solution proceeds by formally defining the random variables and deriving the expected values from first principles.\n\nLet $N=30$ be the total number of days in the month. The problem describes two scenarios: a baseline and a scenario with an SMS reminder intervention.\n\nFor the baseline scenario, let $X_i$ be the indicator random variable for the decision to take the dose on day $i$, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 30\\}$. By definition of an indicator variable, $X_i = 1$ if the dose is taken, and $X_i = 0$ if the dose is not taken. The problem states that these daily events are independent and identically distributed. The probability of taking the dose is given as $\\pi = 0.4$.\nThus, for each day $i$:\n$$P(X_i = 1) = \\pi = 0.4$$\n$$P(X_i = 0) = 1 - \\pi = 0.6$$\n\nThe expected value of a single daily indicator variable, $E[X_i]$, is, by the definition of expectation for a discrete random variable:\n$$E[X_i] = \\sum_{k \\in \\{0,1\\}} k \\cdot P(X_i = k) = (1 \\cdot P(X_i = 1)) + (0 \\cdot P(X_i = 0))$$\n$$E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot \\pi + 0 \\cdot (1 - \\pi) = \\pi = 0.4$$\n\nThe total number of doses taken in the $30$-day month for the baseline scenario is the sum of the daily indicator variables, $S_X = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$. The expected total number of doses is the expectation of this sum. Using the linearity of expectation, which states that the expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expectations ($E[\\sum_i X_i] = \\sum_i E[X_i]$):\n$$E[S_X] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]$$\nSince the variables are identically distributed, $E[X_i] = \\pi$ for all $i$. Therefore:\n$$E[S_X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\pi = N \\pi = 30 \\times 0.4 = 12$$\n\nSimilarly, for the SMS reminder scenario, let $Y_i$ be the indicator random variable for taking the dose on day $i$. The probability of taking the dose in this scenario is $\\pi' = 0.7$.\n$$P(Y_i = 1) = \\pi' = 0.7$$\n$$P(Y_i = 0) = 1 - \\pi' = 0.3$$\n\nThe expected value of a single daily indicator variable $Y_i$ is:\n$$E[Y_i] = 1 \\cdot P(Y_i = 1) + 0 \\cdot P(Y_i = 0) = \\pi' = 0.7$$\n\nThe total number of doses taken in the SMS scenario is $S_Y = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_i$. The expected total number of doses is:\n$$E[S_Y] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[Y_i]$$\nSince the variables are identically distributed with $E[Y_i] = \\pi'$:\n$$E[S_Y] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\pi' = N \\pi' = 30 \\times 0.7 = 21$$\n\nThe expected marginal increase in the number of doses taken, attributable to the SMS reminder, is the difference between the expected number of doses in the SMS scenario and the expected number of doses in the baseline scenario.\n$$\\Delta E = E[S_Y] - E[S_X]$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions:\n$$\\Delta E = N \\pi' - N \\pi = N(\\pi' - \\pi)$$\nPlugging in the numerical values:\n$$\\Delta E = 30 \\times (0.7 - 0.4) = 30 \\times 0.3 = 9$$\n\nThus, the expected additional number of doses taken over the $30$-day month due to the SMS reminder is $9$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9}$$", "id": "4504387"}, {"introduction": "One of the central challenges in preventive medicine is understanding why people procrastinate on important health actions, like getting a flu shot. Behavioral economics models this phenomenon using the concept of present bias, where immediate costs are felt more sharply than delayed benefits. This practice delves into the quasi-hyperbolic discounting model to show how a 'naive' individual, who is unaware of their own future lack of self-control, plans to act but ultimately fails to do so, a conflict known as dynamic inconsistency. [@problem_id:4504396]", "problem": "Consider a single preventive action (a seasonal influenza vaccination) evaluated by a present-biased decision maker in the sense of quasi-hyperbolic discounting. The preventive action can be taken at two discrete decision points: today at time $t=0$ or next week at time $t=1$. If taken at either $t=0$ or $t=1$, the action reduces an expected illness cost by $7$ that would otherwise be incurred one month from now, which we treat as four weeks ahead at time $t=4$. The monetary cost of the vaccination is $5$ paid at the time it is taken. Assume a commonly used quasi-hyperbolic time preference structure with parameters $(\\beta,\\delta)=(0.7,0.99)$, where immediate outcomes at the evaluation time are weighted by $1$, and all outcomes strictly in the future from the evaluation time are weighted by $\\beta \\delta^{t}$, with $t$ denoting the number of weeks ahead from the evaluation point. The agent is naive with respect to present bias: when planning today about what they will do next week, they fail to anticipate that next week they will still apply present-biased weighting, and instead forecast that their future self will evaluate delayed outcomes with $\\beta=1$.\n\nUsing these foundations, do the following:\n1. From the standpoint of $t=0$, compute the discounted net utility difference between vaccinating now versus not vaccinating now, and infer the predicted choice today, denoted by the indicator $x_{0}$, where $x_{0}=1$ if the agent vaccinates today and $x_{0}=0$ otherwise.\n2.

In this problem, the utility $u(c)$ is simply the monetary value $c$.\n\nThe decision maker must choose whether to take a preventive action (vaccination) at time $t=0$ or at time $t=1$. The vaccination has a cost of $5$ paid at the time of action and provides a delayed benefit of $7$ at time $t=4$.\n\nWe will solve the problem in three sequential steps as requested.\n\n**1. The choice at time $t=0$, denoted by $x_0$**\n\nAt time $t=0$, the agent decides between vaccinating immediately or waiting. We must compare the discounted utility of these two options from the perspective of $t=0$.\n\nThe utility of vaccinating at $t=0$ involves an immediate cost of $5$ and a future benefit of $7$ at $t=4$. The time delay for the benefit is $4$ weeks.\nThe discounted utility is:\n$$U_0(\\text{vaccinate at } t=0) = -5 + \\beta \\delta^{4-0}(7) = -5 + \\beta \\delta^4 (7)$$\n\nIf the agent does not vaccinate at $t=0$, they will reconsider at $t=1$. To evaluate the \"wait\" option, a naive agent at $t=0$ must forecast what they will do at $t=1$. The agent's naivete means they believe their future self at $t=1$ will evaluate outcomes using $\\beta=1$.\n\nLet's determine this predicted choice at $t=1$. From the perspective of $t=1$, a cost of $5$ would be immediate, and the benefit of $7$ would be at $t=4$, which is $4-1=3$ weeks away. The predicted utility of vaccinating at $t=1$, as seen from $t=0$, is:\n$$U_{1}^{\\text{predicted}} (\\text{vaccinate at } t=1) = -5 + (1) \\cdot \\delta^{4-1} (7) = -5 + \\delta^3 (7)$$\nThe alternative is not vaccinating at all, which yields a utility of $0$.

This plan involves a cost of $5$ at $t=1$ and a benefit of $7$ at $t=4$. Both are future outcomes from the $t=0$ perspective.\n$$U_0(\\text{wait}) = \\beta \\delta^{1-0}(-5) + \\beta \\delta^{4-0}(7) = -5\\beta\\delta + 7\\beta\\delta^4$$\n\nTo determine the choice $x_0$, we compare $U_0(\\text{vaccinate at } t=0)$ and $U_0(\\text{wait})$. The agent will wait if $U_0(\\text{wait}) > U_0(\\text{vaccinate at } t=0)$.\nComparing the two utility expressions:\n$$-5\\beta\\delta + 7\\beta\\delta^4 > -5 + 7\\beta\\delta^4$$\nThis inequality simplifies to:\n$$-5\\beta\\delta > -5$$\nDividing by $-5$ and reversing the inequality sign:\n$$\\beta\\delta < 1$$\nUsing the given parameters, $\\beta\\delta = (0.7)(0.99) = 0.693$.\nSince $0.693 < 1$, the inequality holds. The agent prefers to wait.\nTherefore, the choice at $t=0$ is not to vaccinate. We have $x_0 = 0$.\n\n**2. The stated plan for next week, denoted by $p_1$**\n\nAs part of the analysis for the $t=0$ decision, we determined the agent's plan for $t=1$. This plan is based on the naive forecast that the future self will act with $\\beta=1$. We calculated the predicted utility of vaccinating at $t=1$ to be:\n$$U_{1}^{\\text{predicted}} = -5 + \\delta^3 (7) \\approx 1.792 > 0$$\nSince the agent predicts that taking the action at $t=1$ yields a positive utility compared to the alternative of $0$, their plan is to vaccinate.\nThus, the stated plan for next week is $p_1 = 1$.\n\n**3. Dynamic inconsistency, quantified by $\\Delta = |p_1 - x_1|$**\n\nTo determine if there is dynamic inconsistency, we must find the agent's *actual* choice at $t=1$, denoted by $x_1$, and compare it to the plan $p_1$.\n\nAt time $t=1$, the agent re-evaluates the decision using their true present-biased preferences, with $\\beta = 0.7$. The choice is between vaccinating at $t=1$ or not.\n\nThe utility of vaccinating at $t=1$, evaluated from the perspective of $t=1$, involves an immediate cost of $5$ and a future benefit of $7$ at a delay of $3$ weeks.\n$$U_1(\\text{vaccinate at } t=1) = -5 + \\beta \\delta^{4-1}(7) = -5 + \\beta \\delta^3 (7)$$\nThe alternative is not to vaccinate, which has a utility of $0$. The agent will vaccinate if $U_1 > 0$.\nSubstituting the parameters $(\\beta, \\delta) = (0.7, 0.99)$:\n$$U_1(\\text{vaccinate at } t=1) = -5 + (0.7)(0.99)^3(7) = -5 + (0.7)(0.970299)(7) = -5 + 4.7544651 = -0.2455349$$\nSince $U_1(\\text{vaccinate at } t=1) < 0$, the agent will choose not to vaccinate when the time actually comes.\nTherefore, the actual choice at $t=1$ is $x_1 = 0$.\n\nThe plan-doing mismatch is measured by $\\Delta$. The plan was $p_1=1$ and the actual choice is $x_1=0$.\n$$\\Delta = |p_1 - x_1| = |1 - 0| = 1$$\nA value of $\\Delta = 1$ indicates that dynamic inconsistency has occurred. The agent procrastinates, failing to follow through on their earlier plan.\n\nIn summary, the results are:\n- The choice today is $x_0 = 0$.\n- The plan for next week is $p_1 = 1$.\n- The dynamic inconsistency measure is $\\Delta = 1$.\n\nThe final answer is the row matrix $(x_0, p_1, \\Delta)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4504396"}, {"introduction": "Beyond individual reminders, a more powerful approach involves redesigning the environment in which choices are made—a concept known as 'choice architecture'.

Type I extreme value (Gumbel).\n- **Choice Options:** Vaccination and Non-vaccination.\n- **Deterministic Utilities (Opt-in Policy):**\n  - Vaccination: $U_{v} = \\alpha - c$.\n  - Non-vaccination: $U_{n} = 0$.\n- **Deterministic Utilities (Opt-out Policy):**\n  - The opt-out policy introduces a psychological utility boost $d$ to the vaccination option.\n  - Effective vaccination utility: $U_{v}^{\\prime} = U_{v} + d = (\\alpha - c) + d$.\n- **Data and Parameters:**\n  - Last-year vaccination uptake under opt-in policy: $0.40$.\n  - Estimated parameter value for the utility difference: $\\alpha - c = -0.2$.\n  - Estimated value for the default utility boost: $d = 0.5$.\n- **Task:** Derive the vaccination choice probability under the opt-out policy and compute the predicted new uptake, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the required criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on the Random Utility Model with Gumbel-distributed error terms, which is the foundation of the widely used multinomial logit model in economics and other social sciences. The concept of a default boost ($d$) is a core tenet of behavioral economics, specifically \"nudge theory.\" The application to preventive medicine is a standard and well-researched area. Thus, the problem is scientifically grounded.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem asks for a specific quantity (vaccination probability under a new policy) and provides a clear model and all necessary parameter values ($\\alpha-c$ and $d$) to compute it. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** There is a potential inconsistency in the provided data. The framework of a RUM with i.i.d. standard Gumbel errors yields the logistic choice probability. Under the opt-in policy, the probability of vaccination is given by $P_v = \\frac{\\exp(U_v)}{\\exp(U_v) + \\exp(U_n)}$. Using the provided parameter $\\alpha - c = -0.2$ for $U_v$ and $U_n=0$, the model predicts an opt-in uptake of:\n$$ P_v(\\text{opt-in}) = \\frac{\\exp(\\alpha-c)}{\\exp(\\alpha-c) + \\exp(0)} = \\frac{\\exp(-0.2)}{\\exp(-0.2) + 1} $$\nNumerically, this is $\\exp(-0.2) \\approx 0.81873$, so:\n$$ P_v(\\text{opt-in}) \\approx \\frac{0.81873}{0.81873 + 1} \\approx 0.4502 $$\nThis predicted value of approximately $0.4502$ is inconsistent with the stated \"last-year uptake\" of $0.40$. However, the problem framing resolves this issue. It separates the contextual information (\"The clinic’s last-year uptake was $0.40$\") from the direct inputs for the calculation (\"For the purpose of predicting..., suppose that parameters have been estimated as $\\alpha-c=-0.2$ and ... $d=0.5$\"). In applied statistical modeling, it is common for a model based on estimated parameters not to perfectly reproduce every individual data point. The discrepancy between $0.40$ and $0.4502$ reflects this reality. The explicit directive is to use the provided estimated parameters for the prediction. Therefore, the problem is not logically contradictory but rather presents a realistic modeling scenario. The value $0.40$ is understood as contextual background, not as a strict constraint for the calculation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. The apparent inconsistency is resolved by interpreting the problem as a standard application of a statistical model, where the model parameters provided are to be used for prediction, and the observational data is contextual.

We are asked to predict the uptake under the new opt-out policy.\n\nFor the opt-out policy, the deterministic components of utility are given as:\n- Vaccination: $V'_{v} = U'_{v} = (\\alpha - c) + d$\n- Non-vaccination: $V_n = U_n = 0$\n\nThe problem provides the necessary parameter values:\n- $\\alpha - c = -0.2$\n- $d = 0.5$\n\nWe substitute these values into the utility function for vaccination under the opt-out policy:\n$$ V'_{v} = -0.2 + 0.5 = 0.3 $$\nThe utility for non-vaccination remains $V_n = 0$.\n\nNow, we can compute the probability of choosing vaccination under the opt-out policy, which represents the predicted new uptake. Let's denote this probability as $P'_{v}$:\n$$ P'_{v} = \\frac{\\exp(V'_{v})}{\\exp(V'_{v}) + \\exp(V_n)} $$\nSubstituting the calculated utility values:\n$$ P'_{v} = \\frac{\\exp(0.3)}{\\exp(0.3) + \\exp(0)} $$\nSince $\\exp(0) = 1$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$ P'_{v} = \\frac{\\exp(0.3)}{\\exp(0.3) + 1} $$\nTo find the numerical value, we first calculate $\\exp(0.3)$:\n$$ \\exp(0.3) \\approx 1.3498588 $$\nNow, we substitute this value back into the probability formula:\n$$ P'_{v} \\approx \\frac{1.3498588}{1.3498588 + 1} = \\frac{1.3498588}{2.3498588} $$\n$$ P'_{v} \\approx 0.5744425 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
