Understanding this principle is the first step toward recognizing that rigorous economic evaluation is an ethical imperative in public health.

Evidence indicates that, for the eligible population, both modalities produce the same expected per-person gain of $q = 0.05$ Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). The two modalities differ only in unit cost: an individualized counseling modality costs $c_{A} = 1000$ dollars per person, whereas a group counseling modality costs $c_{B} = 200$ dollars per person. Because of an ethical appeal to individualized attention, a policymaker who ignores opportunity cost selects Plan I, which uses the entire budget on the individualized modality. An analyst proposes Plan II, which uses the entire budget on the group modality and enrolls all individuals who would have been served under Plan I plus as many additional eligible individuals as the budget allows.\n\nUsing only the definitions of a budget constraint, opportunity cost (the health benefit forgone by not choosing the best feasible alternative), and Pareto dominance (an allocation that makes at least one individual better off without making anyone worse off), determine whether Plan I is Pareto-inferior to Plan II in terms of individual health outcomes among the eligible population. Then, compute the magnitude of the opportunity cost of Plan I, defined as the net total QALYs foregone by Plan I relative to Plan II. Express your final answer as a single number in QALYs.

We are asked to determine if Plan I is Pareto-inferior to Plan II and to calculate the opportunity cost of Plan I relative to Plan II.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Total budget: $B = 1.0 \\times 10^5$ dollars\n- Eligible population size: $N = 500$ individuals\n- Per-person health gain: $q = 0.05$ Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)\n- Cost of individualized counseling (Modality A): $c_A = 1000$ dollars per person\n- Cost of group counseling (Modality B): $c_B = 200$ dollars per person\n\nFirst, we analyze Plan I. This plan allocates the entire budget $B$ to the individualized counseling modality (Modality A). The number of individuals who can be served under Plan I, denoted by $n_I$, is determined by the budget constraint:\n$$n_I = \\frac{B}{c_A} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^5}{1000} = 100$$\nSince $n_I = 100$ is less than the total eligible population $N = 500$, this plan is feasible. The total health benefit generated by Plan I, measured in total QALYs gained ($Q_I$), is the number of people served multiplied by the per-person QALY gain:\n$$Q_I = n_I \\times q = 100 \\times 0.05 = 5 \\text{ QALYs}$$\nUnder Plan I, $100$ individuals each gain $0.05$ QALYs, and the remaining $N - n_I = 500 - 100 = 400$ individuals receive no intervention and thus gain $0$ QALYs.\n\nNext, we analyze Plan II. This plan allocates the entire budget $B$ to the group counseling modality (Modality B). The number of individuals who can be served under Plan II, denoted by $n_{II}$, is:\n$$n_{II} = \\frac{B}{c_B} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^5}{200} = 500$$\nSince $n_{II} = 500$ is equal to the total eligible population $N = 500$, this plan serves every eligible individual, which is consistent with the problem description. The total health benefit generated by Plan II ($Q_{II}$) is:\n$$Q_{II} = n_{II} \\times q = 500 \\times 0.05 = 25 \\text{ QALYs}$$\nUnder Plan II, all $500$ eligible individuals each gain $0.05$ QALYs.\n\nNow, we must determine if Plan I is Pareto-inferior to Plan II. An allocation is Pareto-inferior to another if the alternative allocation makes at least one person better off without making anyone worse off. We compare the outcomes for every individual in the eligible population ($N=500$) under both plans. We can partition the population into two groups:\n1.  The group of $n_I = 100$ individuals who would be served under Plan I.\n2.  The group of $N - n_I = 400$ individuals who would not be served under Plan I.\n\nFor the first group of $100$ individuals:\n- Under Plan I, they are served and each gains $q = 0.05$ QALYs.\n- Under Plan II, they are also served (as part of the total $500$) and each gains $q = 0.05$ QALYs.\nThe individuals in this group are equally well off under both plans. No one is made worse off.\n\nFor the second group of $400$ individuals:\n- Under Plan I, they are not served and their QALY gain is $0$.\n- Under Plan II, they are served and each gains $q = 0.05$ QALYs.\nThe individuals in this group are strictly better off under Plan II.\n\nSince Plan II makes $400$ individuals strictly better off and makes no individual worse off compared to Plan I, Plan II Pareto-dominates Plan I. Consequently, Plan I is Pareto-inferior to Plan II.\n\nFinally, we compute the magnitude of the opportunity cost of Plan I. The problem defines opportunity cost as the health benefit forgone by not choosing the best feasible alternative. Between Plan I and Plan II, Plan II yields the greater total health benefit ($Q_{II} = 25$ QALYs vs. $Q_I = 5$ QALYs). Therefore, Plan II is the best feasible alternative. The opportunity cost of Plan I is the net total QALYs foregone by choosing Plan I over Plan II. This is calculated as the difference between the total QALYs gained under Plan II and Plan I.\n$$\\text{Opportunity Cost} = Q_{II} - Q_I$$\n$$\\text{Opportunity Cost} = 25 - 5 = 20$$\nThe opportunity cost of Plan I is $20$ QALYs.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20}$$", "id": "4524606"}, {"introduction": "Building on the importance of efficiency, this exercise introduces a formal tool for comparing health programs head-to-head.

Mastering the NHB framework equips you to make decisions that maximize total health for a population under real-world budget constraints.

Each program has been evaluated relative to doing nothing and yields an incremental cost and an incremental health effect, measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). A Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) is defined as one year of life in perfect health, and partial health states receive a fractional weight between $0$ and $1$ reflecting the quality of life. It is a well-tested fact in health economics that when budgets are fixed, spending on a new program necessarily displaces some other healthcare activity. Empirical studies of marginal productivity suggest that, on average, the health system generates a certain number of QALYs per unit of currency at the margin.\n\nAssume the following program evaluations:\n- Program $1$: incremental cost $c_{1} = 4.8$ million dollars and incremental health effect $e_{1} = 930$ QALYs.\n- Program $2$: incremental cost $c_{2} = 3.2$ million dollars and incremental health effect $e_{2} = 860$ QALYs.\n\nAssume that the health system’s marginal productivity of displaced care is $\\lambda_{h} = 60$ QALYs per million dollars.

The problem states that any new expenditure displaces existing healthcare activities. The value of this displaced activity, in terms of health, represents the opportunity cost of the new expenditure.\n\nLet a given program have an incremental cost $c$ and produce an incremental health effect (gain) of $e$, measured in QALYs. The cost $c$ is not incurred in a vacuum; it consumes resources that would have otherwise been used to produce health. The marginal productivity of the health system, denoted by $\\lambda_{h}$, quantifies the amount of health (in QALYs) generated per unit of currency spent at the margin.\n\nTherefore, the health opportunity cost of spending an amount $c$ on a new program is the health that is forgone by displacing other services. This is calculated as the product of the cost and the marginal productivity of the system:\n$$\n\\text{Health Forgone} = c \\times \\lambda_{h}\n$$\nThe appropriate comparison metric, as dictated by the objective to maximize net health, is the Net Health Benefit (NHB).
