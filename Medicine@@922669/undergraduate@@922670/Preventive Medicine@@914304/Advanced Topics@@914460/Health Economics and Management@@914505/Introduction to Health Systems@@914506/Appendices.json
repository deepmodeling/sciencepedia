A national guideline recommends a coverage ratio of $1$ community health worker per $1{,}000$ people ($1:1{,}000$). The district population is $350{,}000$. Planning is based on the following core definitions and well-tested workforce concepts: the coverage ratio defines the target number of full-time equivalent community health workers needed, the Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) is the fraction of full-time workload a single worker provides (e.g., $1.0$ for full-time, $0.5$ for half-time), and the attrition rate is the fraction of workers who leave or are otherwise unavailable during the planning horizon, reducing the effective workforce.\n\nUsing these foundations, determine the required number of individual community health workers to meet the coverage target under four scenarios:\n1. Baseline: no attrition and all workers at $1.0$ FTE.\n2. Attrition only: an attrition rate of $10\\%$ with all workers at $1.0$ FTE.\n3.

Let this number be $N_{ref}$. Each refrigerator has a gross internal volume of $V_{ref} = 60~\\mathrm{L}$. The total gross capacity provided by $N_{ref}$ units must be greater than or equal to the required gross capacity, $V_{gross,req}$.\n$$N_{ref} \\times V_{ref} \\ge V_{gross,req}$$\nTherefore, the minimum number of refrigerators is:\n$$N_{ref} \\ge \\frac{V_{gross,req}}{V_{ref}}$$\nFor accuracy, we use the unrounded value of $V_{gross,req}$:\n$$N_{ref} \\ge \\frac{156.25~\\mathrm{L}}{60~\\mathrm{L}} \\approx 2.604167$$\nSince the number of refrigerators must be an integer and must meet or exceed the requirement, we must take the ceiling of this value.\n$$N_{ref} = \\lceil 2.604167 \\rceil = 3$$\nThus, a minimum of $3$ refrigerator units is required.\nThe final answer consists of two parts: the rounded gross capacity and the number of units.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 156.3 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4542910"}, {"introduction": "Health systems perpetually face the challenge of allocating finite resources to meet near-infinite health needs.

Equivalently, $k$ is the cost of generating one marginal QALY. Therefore, spending an amount $\\Delta C_i$ on a new intervention $i$ displaces services that would have generated $\\frac{\\Delta C_i}{k}$ QALYs.\n\nThe Net Health Benefit (NHB) of implementing intervention $i$ is the health it generates minus the health foregone by displacing other services.\n$$NHB_i = \\Delta Q_i - \\frac{\\Delta C_i}{k}$$\nTo maximize the aggregate health of the population, the health system should only fund interventions that yield a positive net health benefit, i.e., $NHB_i > 0$.\n$$NHB_i > 0 \\implies \\Delta Q_i - \\frac{\\Delta C_i}{k} > 0$$\n$$\\Delta Q_i > \\frac{\\Delta C_i}{k}$$\n$$k \\cdot \\Delta Q_i > \\Delta C_i$$\n$$k > \\frac{\\Delta C_i}{\\Delta Q_i}$$\nThis inequality simplifies to $k > ICER_i$. Thus, a necessary condition for an intervention to be considered for funding is that its Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio must be less than the system's opportunity cost threshold. Any intervention with $ICER_i \\ge k$ is not cost-effective, because it produces less (or equal) health per dollar than the services it displaces.\n\nAmong the cost-effective interventions (those with $ICER_i < k$), we must select a portfolio that maximizes health gain within the budget $B$. This is a resource allocation problem analogous to the 0/1 knapsack problem. The standard algorithm, which is optimal under assumptions of divisibility and a good heuristic for indivisible projects, is to prioritize interventions based on their efficiency. The efficiency of an intervention is the health gain per unit cost, $\\frac{\\Delta Q_i}{\\Delta C_i}$, which is the reciprocal of the ICER, $\\frac{1}{ICER_i}$. To maximize health gain for a given budget, we must prioritize interventions with the highest efficiency, which corresponds to the lowest ICER.\n\nThe complete selection rule is therefore:\n1.  For each candidate intervention $i$, calculate its ICER using the formula $ICER_i = \\frac{\\Delta C_i}{\\Delta Q_i}$.\n2.  Discard all interventions that are not cost-effective, i.e., those for which $ICER_i \\ge k$.\n3.  Rank the remaining, cost-effective interventions in increasing order of their ICER (from most efficient to least efficient).\n4.  Beginning with the top-ranked intervention, select interventions for funding in rank order, tracking the cumulative cost.
