It is a well-posed problem in the field of health economics, a sub-discipline of preventive medicine, that is scientifically grounded in the principles of financial mathematics. All necessary data are provided, and the problem is free of contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested: first, the derivation of the general formula for the annuitized annual cost, and second, the application of this formula to the specific numerical example provided.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Annuitized Annual Cost ($A$)**\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the annuitized annual cost, $A$, by equating the initial purchase price, $K$, to the present value ($PV$) of a constant stream of annual payments over a period of $L$ years, with a constant real discount rate $r$. The annual payments are assumed to occur at the end of each year, which corresponds to an ordinary annuity.\n\nThe present value of a single future payment $A_t$ made at the end of year $t$ is calculated by discounting it back to the present (year $0$):\n$$ PV_t = \\frac{A_t}{(1+r)^t} $$\nIn this problem, the annual payment is constant, so $A_t = A$ for all $t$.\n\nThe total present value of the stream of $L$ annual payments is the sum of the present values of each individual payment from year $t=1$ to $t=L$:\n$$ PV_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{t=1}^{L} \\frac{A}{(1+r)^t} $$\n\nAccording to the problem statement, this total present value must equal the initial capital cost, $K$:\n$$ K = \\sum_{t=1}^{L} \\frac{A}{(1+r)^t} $$\n\nTo solve for $A$, we can factor it out of the summation, as it is a constant:\n$$ K = A \\left( \\sum_{t=1}^{L} \\frac{1}{(1+r)^t} \\right) $$\n\nThe term in the parentheses is a finite geometric series. Let the common ratio be $x = \\frac{1}{1+r}$. The series can be written as:\n$$ \\sum_{t=1}^{L} x^t = x^1 + x^2 + \\dots + x^L $$\nThe sum of a finite geometric series with the first term $a_1$ and a common ratio $x$ is given by the formula $S_n = a_1 \\frac{1-x^n}{1-x}$. For our series, the first term is $a_1 = x$, and the number of terms is $n=L$.\n$$ \\sum_{t=1}^{L} x^t = x \\frac{1-x^L}{1-x} $$\n\nSubstituting $x = \\frac{1}{1+r}$ back into this formula:\n$$ \\sum_{t=1}^{L} \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)^t = \\frac{1}{1+r} \\cdot \\frac{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)^L}{1 - \\frac{1}{1+r}} = \\frac{1}{1+r} \\cdot \\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-L}}{\\frac{1+r-1}{1+r}} = \\frac{1}{1+r} \\cdot \\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-L}}{\\frac{r}{1+r}} $$\n\nSimplifying this expression yields the sum of the series:\n$$ \\sum_{t=1}^{L} \\frac{1}{(1+r)^t} = \\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-L}}{r} $$\n\nNow we substitute this result back into the equation for $K$:\n$$ K = A \\left[ \\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-L}}{r} \\right] $$\n\nFinally, we rearrange the equation to solve for the annuitized annual cost $A$:\n$$ A = K \\left[ \\frac{r}{1 - (1+r)^{-L}} \\right] $$\nThis is the desired general formula. The term in the brackets, $\\frac{r}{1 - (1+r)^{-L}}$, is known as the capital recovery factor (CRF).\n\n**Part 2: Application to the PCR Platform Example**\n\nWe are given the following specific values:\n- Purchase price $K = \\$500,000$\n- Useful lifespan $L = 10$ years\n- Constant real discount rate $r = 0.05$\n\nWe substitute these numerical values into the derived formula for $A$:\n$$ A = 500,000 \\cdot \\left[ \\frac{0.05}{1 - (1+0.05)^{-10}} \\right] $$\n$$ A = 500,000 \\cdot \\left[ \\frac{0.05}{1 - (1.05)^{-10}} \\right] $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the value of the term $(1.05)^{-10}$:\n$$ (1.05)^{-10} \\approx 0.6139132535 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator of the fraction inside the brackets:\n$$ 1 - (1.05)^{-10} \\approx 1 - 0.6139132535 = 0.3860867465 $$\n\nNow, we can compute the final value for $A$:\n$$ A = 500,000 \\cdot \\left[ \\frac{0.05}{0.3860867465} \\right] \\approx 500,000 \\cdot (0.1295045817) $$\n$$ A \\approx 64752.29085 $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in dollars per year and rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $64752.29085...$. The first four significant figures are $6$, $4$, $7$, and $5$. The fifth significant digit is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down. The rounded value is $64750$.

In formal decision theory, this means that selecting one project precludes the selection of any other. If interpreted strictly, the problem would be to select the single project with the highest NPV that is within the budget. However, the subsequent tasks—\"choose among... projects under a hard upfront budget cap\", find \"the portfolio that maximizes total NPV\", and form a portfolio via a \"greedy\" ranking—all strongly imply that a combination (a portfolio) of projects is to be chosen. This describes a capital rationing problem with *independent* projects. The use of \"mutually exclusive\" appears to be imprecise wording, a common issue in applied problems. The context makes the intended problem—a 0/1 knapsack problem where we select a subset of independent, indivisible projects to maximize total NPV subject to a budget—unambiguously clear. Resolving this ambiguity in favor of the clear contextual meaning does not invalidate the problem but is a necessary step. Under this interpretation, the problem is well-posed.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem statement is expressed in objective, quantitative terms, free from subjective or biased language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement contains a minor terminological flaw (\"mutually exclusive\" instead of \"independent\").

Project C ($BCR \\approx 1.8447$)\n    2.  Project B ($BCR \\approx 1.5571$)\n    3.  Project E ($BCR \\approx 1.1788$)\n    4.  Project A ($BCR \\approx 1.1314$)\n    5.  Project D ($BCR \\approx 1.1028$)\n-   **Greedy Selection Process**:\n    1.  Start with budget = $\\$8.0$ million.\n    2.  Select Project C (Cost $\\$0.5$M). Remaining budget: $\\$8.0 - \\$0.5 = \\$7.5$M. Portfolio: $\\{$C$\\}$.\n    3.  Select Project B (Cost $\\$5.0$M). Remaining budget: $\\$7.5 - \\$5.0 = \\$2.5$M. Portfolio: $\\{$C, B$\\}$.\n    4.  Consider Project E (Cost $\\$4.0$M). Cannot afford, as $\\$4.0 > \\$2.5$. Skip.\n    5.  Select Project A (Cost $\\$2.0$M). Remaining budget: $\\$2.5 - \\$2.0 = \\$0.5$M. Portfolio: $\\{$C, B, A$\\}$.\n    6.  Consider Project D (Cost $\\$3.0$M). Cannot afford, as $\\$3.0 > \\$0.5$. Skip.\n\nThe process terminates. The portfolio selected by the greedy BCR ranking is **$\\{$A, B, C$\\}$**.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The NPV-maximizing portfolio is $\\{$B, A, C$\\}$, and the greedy BCR ranking also selects $\\{$B, A, C$\\}$. BCR-based selection is optimal when projects are divisible or when costs are equal across projects, but for indivisible projects with unequal costs it can be misleading.**\n-   The NPV-maximizing portfolio is indeed $\\{$B, A, C$\\}$. This is correct.\n-   The greedy BCR ranking also selects $\\{$B, A, C$\\}$. This is correct.\n-   The theoretical statement is also correct. The BCR-greedy approach is provably optimal for the *continuous* knapsack problem (divisible projects). For the 0/1 knapsack problem (indivisible projects), it is a heuristic that is not guaranteed to be optimal. Lumpy, unequal costs are the reason for its potential sub-optimality. The case of equal costs is a special case where ranking by BCR is equivalent to ranking by NPV, and the greedy method is optimal. Thus, this entire statement is sound.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The NPV-maximizing portfolio is $\\{$B, D$\\}$, while the greedy BCR ranking selects $\\{$C, A, E$\\}$. BCR-based selection is always optimal even for indivisible, lump-sum projects under a budget cap.**\n-   The NPV-maximizing portfolio is $\\{$A, B, C$\\}$ (NPV $\\$3.471$M), not $\\{$B, D$\\}$ (NPV $\\$3.094$M). This is incorrect.\n-   The greedy BCR ranking selects $\\{$A, B, C$\\}$, not $\\{$C, A, E$\\}$. This is incorrect.\n-   The claim that BCR-based selection is \"always optimal\" for indivisible projects is a well-known falsehood in capital budgeting theory. This is incorrect.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The NPV-maximizing portfolio is $\\{$B, A, C$\\}$, but the greedy BCR ranking selects $\\{$B, D$\\}$; this shows BCR is generally misleading even when projects are perfectly divisible with constant marginal returns.**\n-   The NPV-maximizing portfolio is correct, but the greedy BCR ranking selects $\\{$A, B, C$\\}$, not $\\{$B, D$\\}$. This is incorrect.\n-   The claim that BCR is \"misleading even when projects are perfectly divisible\" is the opposite of the known principle. For divisible projects, it is the optimal strategy. This is incorrect.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The NPV-maximizing portfolio is $\\{$B, A, C$\\}$, and the greedy BCR ranking selects $\\{$B, A, C$\\}$; therefore BCR-based selection is always optimal for any discrete project set under any budget cap.**\n-   The calculation of the portfolios is correct.\n-   The conclusion (\"therefore...\") is a logical fallacy of hasty generalization. That the heuristic worked in this single instance does not prove it is always optimal. Counterexamples are well-known to exist. This statement is false.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The NPV-maximizing portfolio is $\\{$E, D, C$\\}$, while the greedy BCR ranking selects $\\{$B, A, C$\\}$. BCR-based selection is optimal only when all benefits are equal across projects regardless of costs.**\n-   The NPV-maximizing portfolio is $\\{$A, B, C$\\}$, not $\\{$E, D, C$\\}$ (NPV $\\$1.445$M vs $\\$3.471$M). This is incorrect.\n-   The condition that \"all benefits are equal\" is not a condition for the optimality of BCR ranking. The optimality depends on the nature of the costs and divisibility, not the equality of benefits. This is incorrect.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4517058"}]}
