Therefore, it is deemed valid.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of expected costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for two strategies, followed by a comparison using the net monetary benefit (NMB) framework and a specific willingness-to-pay threshold.\n\nFirst, I will define the given parameters symbolically.\n\nFor Strategy A (screening test):\n- Probability of early detection: $p_{ed} = 0.3$\n- Cost of early detection: $C_{ed} = 500$ USD\n- QALYs with early detection: $Q_{ed} = 0.9$\n- Probability of missed detection: $p_{md} = 0.7$\n- Cost of missed detection: $C_{md} = 200$ USD\n- QALYs with missed detection: $Q_{md} = 0.7$\nNote that the probabilities of the two outcomes for Strategy A sum to unity: $p_{ed} + p_{md} = 0.3 + 0.7 = 1$.\n\nFor Strategy B (no test):\n- Cost of no test: $C_B = 0$ USD\n- QALYs with no test: $Q_B = 0.8$\n\nThe willingness-to-pay threshold is given as $\\lambda = 50,000$ USD per QALY.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in four steps:\n1. Calculate the expected cost and expected QALY for Strategy A.\n2. Identify the expected cost and expected QALY for Strategy B.\n3. Calculate the Net Monetary Benefit (NMB) for each strategy.\n4. Calculate the difference in NMB as specified.\n\nStep 1: Expected Values for Strategy A\nThe expected value of a discrete random variable is the sum of the value of each outcome multiplied by its probability.\nThe expected cost of Strategy A, denoted $E[C_A]$, is calculated as:\n$$E[C_A] = (p_{ed} \\times C_{ed}) + (p_{md} \\times C_{md})$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$E[C_A] = (0.3 \\times 500) + (0.7 \\times 200) = 150 + 140 = 290$$\nSo, the expected cost for Strategy A is $290$ USD.\n\nThe expected QALYs for Strategy A, denoted $E[Q_A]$, is calculated similarly:\n$$E[Q_A] = (p_{ed} \\times Q_{ed}) + (p_{md} \\times Q_{md})$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$E[Q_A] = (0.3 \\times 0.9) + (0.7 \\times 0.7) = 0.27 + 0.49 = 0.76$$\nSo, the expected QALYs for Strategy A is $0.76$.\n\nStep 2: Expected Values for Strategy B\nStrategy B has only one outcome, which occurs with a probability of $1$. Therefore, its expected values are simply the values for that single outcome.\nThe expected cost of Strategy B is $E[C_B] = C_B = 0$ USD.\nThe expected QALYs for Strategy B is $E[Q_B] = Q_B = 0.8$.\n\nStep 3: Net Monetary Benefit Calculation\nThe Net Monetary Benefit (NMB) is a measure used to evaluate cost-effectiveness. It is defined as:\n$$NMB = (\\lambda \\times E[Q]) - E[C]$$\nA strategy is considered cost-effective relative to another if it has a higher NMB.\n\nFor Strategy A, the NMB is:\n$$NMB_A = (\\lambda \\times E[Q_A]) - E[C_A]$$\nSubstituting the calculated expected values and the given $\\lambda$:\n$$NMB_A = (50,000 \\times 0.76) - 290 = 38,000 - 290 = 37,710$$\nThe NMB for Strategy A is $37,710$ USD.\n\nFor Strategy B, the NMB is:\n$$NMB_B = (\\lambda \\times E[Q_B]) - E[C_B]$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$NMB_B = (50,000 \\times 0.8) - 0 = 40,000 - 0 = 40,000$$\nThe NMB for Strategy B is $40,000$ USD.\n\nStep 4: Comparison and Final Calculation\nComparing the NMB of the two strategies, we find that $NMB_B > NMB_A$ ($40,000 > 37,710$). This indicates that Strategy B (no test) is the preferred strategy under the given willingness-to-pay threshold.\n\nThe problem asks for the net monetary benefit difference, defined as $NMB_B - NMB_A$.\n$$\\text{Difference} = NMB_B - NMB_A = 40,000 - 37,710 = 2,290$$\nThe difference is $2,290$ USD. The problem requires rounding this result to four significant figures. The number $2,290$ is an exact integer. It can be written as $2.290 \\times 10^3$, which explicitly shows four significant figures, assuming the trailing zero is significant.

The health states are ordered as Healthy ($H$), Diseased ($D$), and Dead ($X$).\n\nThe transition matrix $P$ is constructed such that its element $P_{ij}$ represents the probability of transitioning from state $i$ to state $j$ in one cycle. A fundamental property of a stochastic matrix is that the sum of the probabilities in each row must equal $1$.\n\nFirst, we determine the probabilities for the first row of $P$, which corresponds to transitions from the Healthy ($H$) state. We are given:\n- The probability of transitioning from Healthy to Diseased, $p_{HD} = 0.04$.\n- The probability of transitioning from Healthy to Dead, $p_{HX} = 0.01$.\n\nThe probability of remaining in the Healthy state, $p_{HH}$, is calculated by ensuring the sum of the row is $1$:\n$$p_{HH} + p_{HD} + p_{HX} = 1$$\n$$p_{HH} = 1 - p_{HD} - p_{HX} = 1 - 0.04 - 0.01 = 0.95$$\nThus, the first row of matrix $P$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0.95 & 0.04 & 0.01 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nSecond, we determine the probabilities for the second row of $P$, corresponding to transitions from the Diseased ($D$) state.

The state $X$ is defined as absorbing. This implies that once a member of the cohort enters this state, they cannot leave. Therefore:\n- The probability of remaining in the Dead state is $p_{XX} = 1$.\n- The probabilities of transitioning from Dead to any other state are zero: $p_{XH} = 0$ and $p_{XD} = 0$.\nThus, the third row of matrix $P$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nCombining these rows, the complete transition probability matrix $P$ is:\n$$P = \\begin{pmatrix} p_{HH} & p_{HD} & p_{HX} \\\\ p_{DH} & p_{DD} & p_{DX} \\\\ p_{XH} & p_{XD} & p_{XX} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.95 & 0.04 & 0.01 \\\\ 0.15 & 0.80 & 0.05 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThe initial cohort distribution is given as a row vector $s_0$, where the cohort is entirely Healthy:\n$$s_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThe cohort distribution after one cycle, $s_1$, is found by post-multiplying the initial state vector $s_0$ by the transition matrix $P$:\n$$s_1 = s_0 P$$\n$$s_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.95 & 0.04 & 0.01 \\\\ 0.15 & 0.80 & 0.05 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThe matrix multiplication yields:\nThe first component of $s_1$: $(1)(0.95) + (0)(0.15) + (0)(0) = 0.95$.\nThe second component of $s_1$: $(1)(0.04) + (0)(0.80) + (0)(0) = 0.04$.\nThe third component of $s_1$: $(1)(0.01) + (0)(0.05) + (0)(1) = 0.01$.\n\nTherefore, the one-cycle cohort distribution vector $s_1$ is:\n$$s_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.95 & 0.04 & 0.01 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis vector represents the proportion of the cohort in the Healthy, Diseased, and Dead states, respectively, after one year.

This derivation begins with the fundamental principles governing a memoryless process with a constant hazard rate.\n\n$1$. **Hazard Rate and Survival Function:**\nThe problem states that the process has a constant hazard rate, denoted by $\\lambda$. The hazard rate, $h(t)$, represents the instantaneous risk of an event at time $t$, given that the individual has been event-free up to time $t$. For this problem, $h(t) = \\lambda$ for all $t \\geq 0$.\n\nThe survival function, $S(t)$, is the probability that an individual remains in the event-free state beyond time $t$. It is related to the hazard rate by the following general equation:\n$$S(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^t h(u) \\, du\\right)$$\nGiven that the hazard rate is a constant $\\lambda$, the integral simplifies:\n$$\\int_0^t \\lambda \\, du = \\lambda t$$\nTherefore, the survival function for a process with a constant hazard rate $\\lambda$ is:\n$$S(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\nThis confirms the problem statement's condition that the waiting time to the first event is exponentially distributed, as this is the survival function for an exponential distribution with rate parameter $\\lambda$.\n\n$2$. **Derivation of the Transition Probability:**\nWe need to find the transition probability, let's call it $p$, of moving from the \"event-free\" state to the \"event\" state during a single cycle of duration $\\Delta t$.\n\nAn individual starts the cycle in the event-free state. The transition to the \"event\" state occurs if the event happens at any point within the time interval of length $\\Delta t$. The probability of this occurring is the complement of the probability of *not* having the event during the cycle.\n\nThe probability of *not* having the event during the cycle (i.e., remaining event-free for the entire duration $\\Delta t$) is, by definition, the survival probability at time $\\Delta t$, which is $S(\\Delta t)$.\n$$S(\\Delta t) = \\exp(-\\lambda \\Delta t)$$\nThis term, $S(\\Delta t)$, represents the transition probability of remaining in the \"event-free\" state for one cycle.\n\nThe probability $p$ of transitioning from the \"event-free\" state to the \"event\" state is therefore $1$ minus the probability of remaining in the \"event-free\" state:\n$$p = 1 - S(\\Delta t)$$\nSubstituting the expression for the survival function, we arrive at the derived expression for the per-cycle transition probability:\n$$p = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda \\Delta t)$$\n\n$3$. **Numerical Computation:**\nThe problem provides the following values:\n-   Annual incidence rate (constant hazard rate): $\\lambda = 0.05$ year$^{-1}$\n-   Cycle length: $\\Delta t = 0.25$ years\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$p = 1 - \\exp(-0.05 \\times 0.25)$$\nFirst, we calculate the exponent:\n$$\\lambda \\Delta t = 0.05 \\times 0.25 = 0.0125$$\nNow, we compute the probability:\n$$p = 1 - \\exp(-0.0125)$$\nCalculating the value of the exponential term:\n$$\\exp(-0.0125) \\approx 0.98757753906$$\nFinally, we compute $p$:\n$$p \\approx 1 - 0.98757753906 = 0.01242246094$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to six significant figures.
