We are given the incremental cost, $\\Delta C$, and the incremental effectiveness, $\\Delta E$, of a new therapy compared to a standard of care.\n\n1.  **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**\n    The ICER is a primary metric in cost-effectiveness analysis. It represents the additional cost per unit of additional health outcome gained. By its fundamental definition, it is the ratio of the incremental cost to the incremental effectiveness.\n    \n    The expression for the ICER is:\n    $$\n    ICER = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E}\n    $$\n    Using the provided numerical values:\n    $\\Delta C = 12000$ (in dollars)\n    $\\Delta E = 0.4$ (in QALYs)\n    \n    The numerical value of the ICER is calculated as:\n    $$\n    ICER = \\frac{12000}{0.4} = \\frac{120000}{4} = 30000\n    $$\n    The units of the ICER are dollars per QALY, or $\\$30,000/\\text{QALY}$.\n\n2.  **Net Monetary Benefit (NMB)**\n    The NMB is an alternative metric that quantifies the value of an intervention in monetary terms. It is derived by first monetizing the incremental health gain using the societal willingness-to-pay threshold, $\\lambda$, and then subtracting the incremental cost. The value $\\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E$ represents the monetary worth of the health gain, and $\\Delta C$ is its cost. The net benefit is the difference.\n    \n    The expression for the NMB is:\n    $$\n    NMB = (\\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E) - \\Delta C\n    $$\n    An intervention is considered cost-effective if its NMB is positive ($NMB > 0$), meaning the monetized value of the health gain exceeds the cost.\n    \n    Using the provided numerical values:\n    $\\lambda = 30000$ (in dollars per QALY)\n    $\\Delta E = 0.4$ (in QALYs)\n    $\\Delta C = 12000$ (in dollars)\n    \n    The numerical value of the NMB is calculated as:\n    $$\n    NMB = (30000 \\cdot 0.4) - 12000 = 12000 - 12000 = 0\n    $$\n    The unit of the NMB is dollars ($\\$$). An NMB of $0$ indicates that the monetized health gain is exactly equal to the cost of the intervention.\n\n3.  **Decision Indicator (D)**\n    The decision indicator $D$ is to be formalized based on the NMB and the specified decision rules. The intervention is:\n    - Cost-effective if $NMB > 0$.\n    - Indifferent if $NMB = 0$.\n    - Not cost-effective if $NMB  0$.\n    \n    The indicator $D$ is defined with the values $1$, $0$, and $-1$ corresponding to these three cases. This structure formally corresponds to the signum function, denoted $\\text{sgn}(x)$, which extracts the sign of a real number.\n    \n    Therefore, the decision indicator $D$ can be formalized as:\n    $$\n    D = \\text{sgn}(NMB) = \\text{sgn}((\\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E) - \\Delta C)\n    $$\n    where the signum function is defined as:\n    $$\n    \\text{sgn}(x) = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } x > 0 \\\\ 0  \\text{if } x = 0 \\\\ -1  \\text{if } x  0 \\end{cases}\n    $$\n    We have already calculated that $NMB = 0$. Therefore, the value of the decision indicator is:\n    $$\n    D = \\text{sgn}(0) = 0\n    $$\n    A value of $D=0$ signifies that the therapy is exactly on the cusp of cost-effectiveness at the given willingness-to-pay threshold. This is consistent with the finding that the $ICER = \\$30,000/\\text{QALY}$, which is equal to the threshold $\\lambda = \\$30,000/\\text{QALY}$.\n\n**Summary of Computations**\n- ICER: $30000$ ($\\$/\\text{QALY}$)\n- NMB: $0$ ($\\$$)\n- Decision Indicator $D$: $0$\n\nThe final answer is to be presented as a row matrix $[\\text{ICER}, \\text{NMB}, D]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 30000  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "5003623"}, {"introduction": "While the ICER is intuitive, it can be misleading in certain situations, particularly when an intervention is both less costly and more effective (dominant) or more costly and less effective (dominated).

The ICER is defined as $\\mathrm{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E}$, where $\\Delta C$ is the incremental cost and $\\Delta E$ is the incremental effect. A negative ICER arises in two distinct scenarios:\n$1$. When $\\Delta C  0$ and $\\Delta E  0$: The new intervention is more costly and less effective (harmful).
