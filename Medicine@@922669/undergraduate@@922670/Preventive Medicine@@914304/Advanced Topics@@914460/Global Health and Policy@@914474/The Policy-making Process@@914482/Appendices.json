It is scientifically grounded in standard epidemiological methods, is well-posed with all necessary data provided, and is presented objectively.\n\nThe first part of the problem asks for a justification for using direct age-standardization in the context of policy evaluation for preventive programs. Direct age-standardization is appropriate because it adjusts for differences in the age composition of populations, thereby removing age as a confounding variable when comparing rates. This methodology allows for a fair comparison of underlying event rates, ensuring that policy decisions and resource allocations reflect true differences in health status rather than artifacts of population demographics.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires the computation of the age-standardized incidence rate for hypertension in Jurisdiction A using the direct method. The formula for the direct age-standardized rate (DASR) is the weighted average of the age-specific rates ($I_i$) of the study population, where the weights are derived from the age distribution of a standard population ($N_{std,i}$). The formula is:\n$$ \\text{DASR} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} I_i \\cdot N_{std,i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} N_{std,i}} $$\nwhere $k$ is the number of age strata, $I_i$ is the age-specific incidence rate for the $i$-th stratum in Jurisdiction A (in cases per $1,000$ person-years), and $N_{std,i}$ is the number of persons in the $i$-th stratum of the Policy Planning Standard Population (PPSP).

Much of this evidence comes from observational studies, which are susceptible to unmeasured confounding—hidden factors that may distort the true relationship between an intervention and an outcome. This practice introduces the E-value, a sensitivity analysis tool that quantifies the required strength of an unmeasured confounder to fully explain away an observed association. Calculating and interpreting the E-value is a crucial skill for appraising the robustness of research findings and determining how much confidence to place in the evidence supporting a policy [@problem_id:4586491].", "problem": "A municipal health department is considering a city-wide policy to subsidize primary care visits in low-income neighborhoods as a preventive medicine strategy to reduce new diagnoses of type 2 diabetes mellitus over a two-year period. Before deciding whether to scale the policy, the department evaluates observational evidence from a quasi-experimental cohort comparing neighborhoods that received the subsidy versus those that did not, adjusting for measured covariates (age, baseline obesity, and baseline hypertension). The study reports an adjusted risk ratio of diabetes incidence of $0.72$ in policy neighborhoods compared to non-policy neighborhoods, with a ninety-five percent confidence interval (CI) from $0.60$ to $0.86$. The department also notes a plausible unmeasured confounder, \"health-seeking orientation,\" that could influence both policy exposure and diabetes risk, with external evidence suggesting its association with exposure is unlikely to exceed a risk ratio of $1.7$ and its association with the outcome is unlikely to exceed a risk ratio of $1.6$.\n\nUsing only core epidemiologic definitions of confounding and risk ratios, and the accepted definition of the E-value (evidence value) for risk ratio measures as the minimum strength of association on the risk ratio scale that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the exposure and the outcome, conditional on measured covariates, to fully explain away the observed exposure–outcome association, compute:\n\n- The E-value for the point estimate $0.72$.\n- The E-value for the CI limit nearest the null value $1$, which here is $0.86$.\n\nExpress your results as unitless numbers and round your answers to $4$ significant figures.

It utilizes established principles and definitions from the field of epidemiology, specifically concerning the evaluation of observational evidence and sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding. All necessary data and definitions are provided. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution can be constructed.\n\nThe primary task is to compute two E-values and interpret them in the context of a potential unmeasured confounder. The E-value is a sensitivity analysis parameter that quantifies the minimum strength of association an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the exposure and the outcome to fully explain away an observed exposure-outcome association. The \"null value\" for a risk ratio ($RR$) is $1$, indicating no association.\n\nThe accepted formula for the E-value for an observed risk ratio, $RR_{obs}$, where $RR_{obs} > 1$, is:\n$$E\\text{-value} = RR_{obs} + \\sqrt{RR_{obs} (RR_{obs} - 1)}$$\nFor a protective association where the observed risk ratio, let's denote it $rr_{obs}$, is less than $1$, the magnitude of the association is represented by its inverse, $1/rr_{obs}$.

The formula for $rr_{obs} < 1$ is:\n$$E\\text{-value} = \\frac{1}{rr_{obs}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{rr_{obs}} \\left( \\frac{1}{rr_{obs}} - 1 \\right)}$$\n\nFirst, we will compute the E-value for the point estimate of the adjusted risk ratio.\n\nThe given point estimate is $rr_{obs} = 0.72$. Since this is less than $1$, we use the second formula.\nLet's calculate the inverse of the risk ratio:\n$$\\frac{1}{rr_{obs}} = \\frac{1}{0.72}$$\nNow, we substitute this into the E-value formula:\n$$E\\text{-value}_{\\text{point}} = \\frac{1}{0.72} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{0.72} \\left( \\frac{1}{0.72} - 1 \\right)}$$\n$$E\\text{-value}_{\\text{point}} \\approx 1.38888... + \\sqrt{1.38888... \\left( 1.38888... - 1 \\right)}$$\n$$E\\text{-value}_{\\text{point}} \\approx 1.38888... + \\sqrt{1.38888... \\times 0.38888...}$$\n$$E\\text{-value}_{\\text{point}} \\approx 1.38888... + \\sqrt{0.5399...}$$\n$$E\\text{-value}_{\\text{point}} \\approx 1.38888... + 0.7348...$$\n$$E\\text{-value}_{\\text{point}} \\approx 2.1237...$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, the E-value for the point estimate is $2.124$.\n\nSecond, we will compute the E-value for the confidence interval (CI) limit nearest to the null value of $1$.\n\nThe ninety-five percent CI is given as ($0.60$, $0.86$). The limit nearest the null value of $1$ is $rr_{CI} = 0.86$. Since this is also less than $1$, we again use the formula for a protective association.\nLet's calculate the inverse of this risk ratio:\n$$\\frac{1}{rr_{CI}} = \\frac{1}{0.86}$$\nSubstitute this into the E-value formula:\n$$E\\text{-value}_{CI} = \\frac{1}{0.86} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{0.86} \\left( \\frac{1}{0.86} - 1 \\right)}$$\n$$E\\text{-value}_{CI} \\approx 1.16279... + \\sqrt{1.16279... \\left( 1.16279... - 1 \\right)}$$\n$$E\\text{-value}_{CI} \\approx 1.16279... + \\sqrt{1.16279... \\times 0.16279...}$$\n$$E\\text{-value}_{CI} \\approx 1.16279... + \\sqrt{0.18929...}$$\n$$E\\text{-value}_{CI} \\approx 1.16279... + 0.43507...$$\n$$E\\text{-value}_{CI} \\approx 1.5978...$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, the E-value for the upper CI limit is $1.598$.\n\nFinally, we must interpret these results based on the plausible maximum strengths of association for the unmeasured confounder (\"health-seeking orientation\"). Let $RR_{CE}$ be the risk ratio for the confounder-exposure association and $RR_{CD}$ be the risk ratio for the confounder-outcome association. The problem states that external evidence suggests $RR_{CE}$ is unlikely to exceed $1.7$ and $RR_{CD}$ is unlikely to exceed $1.6$.\n\nInterpretation:\nThe E-value for the point estimate is $2.124$. This means that to explain away the observed adjusted risk ratio of $0.72$, an unmeasured confounder would need to be associated with both the exposure (getting the subsidy) and the outcome (diabetes incidence) with risk ratios of at least $2.124$ each, conditional on the measured covariates. The plausible maximums for the confounder associations are given as $1.7$ and $1.6$. Since both $1.7$ and $1.6$ are less than $2.124$, it is unlikely that an unmeasured confounder of this plausible magnitude could, by itself, fully account for the observed beneficial effect of the policy.\n\nThe E-value for the upper CI limit is $1.598$. This represents the minimum strength of association (for both $RR_{CE}$ and $RR_{CD}$) required to shift the confidence interval so that it includes the null value of $1$. The plausible maximum strengths of the confounder are $RR_{CE} \\le 1.7$ and $RR_{CD} \\le 1.6$. The smaller of these plausible maxima, $1.6$, is very close to and slightly larger than the E-value of $1.598$. For an unmeasured confounder to move the confidence interval to include the null, both $RR_{CE}$ and $RR_{CD}$ must be at least the E-value. Here, we are given that one of the confounder risk ratios ($RR_{CD}$) is plausibly as high as $1.6$, and the other ($RR_{CE}$) is as high as $1.7$. Since both of these plausible maxima are greater than the E-value for the CI limit ($1.598$), it is plausible that the unmeasured confounder could be strong enough to render the association statistically non-significant (i.e., to make the upper CI limit cross $1$).\n\nIn conclusion, while the point estimate of the association appears robust to the specified level of unmeasured confounding, the statistical significance of the finding is not. The plausible unmeasured confounder is strong enough to be of concern, as it could potentially explain away the confidence interval's exclusion of the null.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2.124 & 1.598 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4586491"}, {"introduction": "Once an intervention is found to have a robust effect, the final step is to determine if it represents a good use of limited public health resources.

First, to derive a decision rule based on the monetized value of health gain compared to cost. Second, to apply this rule to a specific case.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the Decision Rule**\n\nThe fundamental criterion for adopting a new intervention is that its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) does not exceed the willingness-to-pay threshold, $\\lambda$. The ICER is defined as the ratio of incremental cost, $\\Delta C$, to incremental health effect, $\\Delta E$. The rule is to adopt the intervention if:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} \\leq \\lambda\n$$\nThis rule is valid for cases where the intervention provides a health gain, i.e., $\\Delta E > 0$. An intervention with $\\Delta E \\leq 0$ would generally not be considered for adoption unless it also saves costs ($\\Delta C < 0$).\n\nTo re-express this rule in a form that compares the monetized value of health gain to cost, we can manipulate the inequality. Since $\\Delta E$ is a positive quantity, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by $\\Delta E$ without changing the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$\n\\Delta C \\leq \\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E\n$$\nThis form of the rule directly compares the incremental cost, $\\Delta C$, to the incremental health gain, $\\Delta E$, monetized by the threshold value $\\lambda$. The term $\\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E$ represents the economic value assigned to the health gain, based on the maximum amount the health system is willing to pay per unit of health (QALY). The intervention is deemed acceptable if its cost does not exceed this monetized health benefit.\n\nTo make this comparison more transparent, we can define a function that represents the net benefit of the intervention in monetary terms. This function is commonly known as the Net Monetary Benefit (NMB). We can rearrange the inequality by subtracting $\\Delta C$ from both sides:\n$$\n\\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E - \\Delta C \\geq 0\n$$\nWe define the function for Net Monetary Benefit as:\n$$\nNMB = \\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E - \\Delta C\n$$\nThe decision rule is then to adopt the intervention if its Net Monetary Benefit is non-negative.\nAdoption condition: $NMB \\geq 0$.\n\n**Task 2: Calculation and Interpretation**\n\nWe are given the following data:\n- Threshold $\\lambda = \\$68{,}000$ per QALY.\n- Baseline $10$-year risk $r_{0} = 0.073$.\n- Relative risk reduction $\\mathrm{RRR} = 0.19$.\n- Average QALY loss per case $L = 1.05$ QALYs.\n- Program cost per person $c_{\\text{prog}} = \\$260.50$.\n- Average treatment cost per case $C_{\\text{case}} = \\$13{,}500$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the required intermediate quantities per person.\n\nThe absolute risk reduction ($\\mathrm{ARR}$) is given by $\\mathrm{ARR} = r_{0} - r_{1}$.
