The terms are well-defined, and the setup is internally consistent and complete for the tasks required. It is a well-posed problem. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nPart 1: Derivation and Calculation of Avoided Deaths\n\nThe number of deaths is the product of the population size and the mortality rate. The baseline number of deaths per year is $D_0 = N y_0$. After the policy reduces the $\\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$ concentration, the new mortality rate is $y_1$, and the new number of deaths is $D_1 = N y_1$. The number of deaths avoided per year, $\\Delta D$, is the difference:\n$$\n\\Delta D = D_0 - D_1 = N (y_0 - y_1)\n$$\nThe relationship between the mortality rates $y_0$ and $y_1$ is given by the relative risk. The relative risk of the baseline concentration compared to the new, lower concentration is the ratio of the mortality rates, $y_0 / y_1$. The change in concentration from the new state to the baseline state is an increase of $\\Delta C$. Using the provided log-linear model, this relative risk is:\n$$\n\\frac{y_0}{y_1} = \\mathrm{RR}(\\Delta C) = \\exp(\\theta \\Delta C)\n$$\nFrom this, we can express the new mortality rate $y_1$ in terms of the baseline rate $y_0$:\n$$\ny_1 = y_0 \\exp(-\\theta \\Delta C)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for avoided deaths gives the exact formula under the log-linear model:\n$$\n\\Delta D = N(y_0 - y_0 \\exp(-\\theta \\Delta C)) = N y_0 (1 - \\exp(-\\theta \\Delta C))\n$$\nThe problem asks for a linearized expression, which is obtained by a first-order Taylor series approximation of the exponential term. For a small argument $x$, $\\exp(x) \\approx 1 + x$. Here, the argument is $x = -\\theta \\Delta C$. The approximation is valid if $|\\theta \\Delta C| \\ll 1$. We can verify this condition. The parameter $\\theta$ is:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{\\ln(\\mathrm{RR}_{10})}{10} = \\frac{\\ln(1.06)}{10} \\approx \\frac{0.05827}{10} = 0.005827\\ (\\mu \\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{m}^{3})^{-1}\n$$\nThe argument is $-\\theta \\Delta C \\approx -0.005827 \\times 3.2 \\approx -0.0186$. Since $|-0.0186| \\ll 1$, the linear approximation is well-justified.\nApplying the approximation $\\exp(-\\theta \\Delta C) \\approx 1 - \\theta \\Delta C$ to the formula for $\\Delta D$:\n$$\n\\Delta D \\approx N y_0 (1 - (1 - \\theta \\Delta C)) = N y_0 (1 - 1 + \\theta \\Delta C)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the derived linearized exposure–response expression:\n$$\n\\Delta D \\approx N y_0 \\theta \\Delta C\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value for the expected annual avoided deaths using the provided inputs:\n- $N = 1.2 \\times 10^{6}$\n- $y_0 = 7.5 \\times 10^{-3}$\n- $\\Delta C = 3.2$\n- $\\theta = \\frac{\\ln(1.06)}{10}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the linearized expression:\n$$\n\\Delta D = (1.2 \\times 10^{6}) \\times (7.5 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\ln(1.06)}{10}\\right) \\times 3.2\n$$\nThe baseline number of annual deaths is $D_0 = N y_0 = (1.2 \\times 10^{6}) \\times (7.5 \\times 10^{-3}) = 9000$.\n$$\n\\Delta D = 9000 \\times \\left(\\frac{\\ln(1.06)}{10}\\right) \\times 3.2 = 900 \\times \\ln(1.06) \\times 3.2\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta D = 2880 \\times \\ln(1.06) \\approx 2880 \\times 0.0582689 \\approx 167.81445...\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $168$ avoided deaths per year.\n\nPart 2: Uncertainty Propagation\n\nTo propagate uncertainty, we consider the estimate of avoided deaths, $\\Delta D$, as a function of the uncertain parameters, which are the concentration-response slope $\\theta$ and the $\\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$ reduction $\\Delta C$. The population $N$ and baseline mortality rate $y_0$ are treated as known constants. The linearized model is $\\Delta D(\\theta, \\Delta C) = N y_0 \\theta \\Delta C$.\n\nLet $\\mu_\\theta$ and $\\sigma_\\theta^2$ be the mean and variance of the estimate for $\\theta$, and let $\\mu_{\\Delta C}$ and $\\sigma_{\\Delta C}^2$ be the mean and variance of the estimate for $\\Delta C$. The central estimate for avoided deaths is $\\Delta \\hat{D} = N y_0 \\mu_\\theta \\mu_{\\Delta C}$.\n\nUsing a first-order Taylor series expansion (the delta method) to approximate the variance of $\\Delta D$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta D) \\approx \\left( \\frac{\\partial(\\Delta D)}{\\partial \\theta} \\right)^2 \\sigma_\\theta^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\partial(\\Delta D)}{\\partial \\Delta C} \\right)^2 \\sigma_{\\Delta C}^2 + 2 \\left( \\frac{\\partial(\\Delta D)}{\\partial \\theta} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\partial(\\Delta D)}{\\partial \\Delta C} \\right) \\mathrm{Cov}(\\theta, \\Delta C)\n$$\nThe partial derivatives, evaluated at the mean values, are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial(\\Delta D)}{\\partial \\theta} = N y_0 \\Delta C \\implies (N y_0 \\mu_{\\Delta C})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial(\\Delta D)}{\\partial \\Delta C} = N y_0 \\theta \\implies (N y_0 \\mu_{\\theta})\n$$\nUnder the given independence assumption, the covariance term $\\mathrm{Cov}(\\theta, \\Delta C)$ is $0$. Substituting the partial derivatives into the variance formula yields:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta D) \\approx (N y_0 \\mu_{\\Delta C})^2 \\sigma_\\theta^2 + (N y_0 \\mu_\\theta)^2 \\sigma_{\\Delta C}^2\n$$\nThis expression identifies the two primary components of variance in the final estimate.\n1.  The first term, $(N y_0 \\mu_{\\Delta C})^2 \\sigma_\\theta^2$, represents the contribution from the uncertainty in the scientific evidence base, specifically the concentration-response slope $\\sigma_\\theta^2$. This is often termed \"parameter uncertainty\".\n2.  The second term, $(N y_0 \\mu_\\theta)^2 \\sigma_{\\Delta C}^2$, represents the contribution from the uncertainty in the projected effectiveness of the policy, $\\sigma_{\\Delta C}^2$. This is often termed \"exposure uncertainty\".\n\nIn the context of HiAP decision-making, this decomposition is highly valuable. It distinguishes between uncertainty inherent in the current state of scientific knowledge (from $\\sigma_\\theta^2$) and uncertainty related to the specific policy's implementation and impact (from $\\sigma_{\\Delta C}^2$). If the overall uncertainty, often represented by a $95\\%$ confidence interval around $\\Delta \\hat{D}$, is large, decision-makers can use this decomposition to understand the primary driver. If exposure uncertainty is dominant, they might invest in better modeling or monitoring of the policy's impact. If parameter uncertainty is dominant, they must accept the limitations of the current science while making a decision, perhaps opting for more precautionary measures.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{168}\n$$", "id": "5002778"}, {"introduction": "While forecasting is crucial, evaluating the real-world effects of a policy after its implementation is equally vital for accountability and learning.

We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to determine the number of injuries averted by the Vision Zero program. This requires two main steps: first, calculating the policy-attributable absolute risk reduction per unit of person-time, and second, applying this rate to the total person-time in the policy city.\n\nFirst, we calculate the overall injury incidence rates for both the policy and control cities, before and after the intervention period. The problem specifies a direct standardization method using a standard population distribution of person-time given by weights $w_{L} = 0.65$ for low-speed zones and $w_{H} = 0.35$ for high-speed corridors.\n\nLet $R$ denote a standardized incidence rate (per $100{,}000$ person-years). The formula for a standardized rate is the weighted average of the strata-specific rates:\n$$R = \\sum_{i} r_i w_i$$\nwhere $i$ represents the stratum (here, $L$ for low-speed and $H$ for high-speed).\n\nFor the policy city, the standardized baseline rate ($R_{0}$) and post-policy rate ($R_{1}$) are:\n$$R_{0} = r_{0L} w_{L} + r_{0H} w_{H}$$\n$$R_{1} = r_{1L} w_{L} + r_{1H} w_{H}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R_{0} = (200 \\times 0.65) + (500 \\times 0.35) = 130 + 175 = 305$$\n$$R_{1} = (140 \\times 0.65) + (350 \\times 0.35) = 91 + 122.5 = 213.5$$\nThe rates are in units of injuries per $100{,}000$ person-years.\n\nFor the control city, the standardized baseline rate ($R^{c}_{0}$) and post-period rate ($R^{c}_{1}$) are similarly calculated:\n$$R^{c}_{0} = r^{c}_{0L} w_{L} + r^{c}_{0H} w_{H}$$\n$$R^{c}_{1} = r^{c}_{1L} w_{L} + r^{c}_{1H} w_{H}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R^{c}_{0} = (190 \\times 0.65) + (480 \\times 0.35) = 123.5 + 168 = 291.5$$\n$$R^{c}_{1} = (170 \\times 0.65) + (440 \\times 0.35) = 110.5 + 154 = 264.5$$\n\nNext, we determine the change in rates over time for both cities.

This is a difference-in-differences approach. The policy-attributable absolute risk reduction, which we denote as $\\mathcal{R}_{attr}$, is:\n$$\\mathcal{R}_{attr} = ARR_{obs} - ARR_{secular}$$\n$$\\mathcal{R}_{attr} = 91.5 - 27 = 64.5$$\nThis value, $64.5$, represents the policy-attributable reduction in injuries per $100{,}000$ person-years.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of injuries averted in the policy city, we must apply this rate to the total person-time accrued in that city. The total person-time is given as $Y = 2.2 \\times 10^{6}$ person-years. The number of averted injuries, $N_{averted}$, is calculated by scaling the rate:\n$$N_{averted} = \\mathcal{R}_{attr} \\times \\frac{Y}{100{,}000}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$N_{averted} = 64.5 \\times \\frac{2.2 \\times 10^{6}}{10^{5}}$$\n$$N_{averted} = 64.5 \\times 22$$\n$$N_{averted} = 1419$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

The standard method for this is linear min-max normalization:\n$$v_{k}(x_{k}) = \\frac{x_{k} - \\min_{j}(x_{k}(T_j))}{\\max_{j}(x_{k}(T_j)) - \\min_{j}(x_{k}(T_j))}$$\nHere, the minimum and maximum are taken over the set of policies $\\{T1, T2, T3\\}$ for each criterion $k$.\n\n- **Criterion 1 ($\\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$ reduction, $x_1$):** Values are $\\{1.2, 2.0, 1.6\\}$. $\\min(x_1) = 1.2$, $\\max(x_1) = 2.0$.\n  $v_1(T1) = (1.2 - 1.2) / (2.0 - 1.2) = 0$.\n  $v_1(T2) = (2.0 - 1.2) / (2.0 - 1.2) = 1$.\n  $v_1(T3) = (1.6 - 1.2) / (2.0 - 1.2) = 0.4 / 0.8 = 0.5$.\n\n- **Criterion 2 (Physical activity, $x_2$):** Values are $\\{35, 10, 20\\}$. $\\min(x_2) = 10$, $\\max(x_2) = 35$.\n  $v_2(T1) = (35 - 10) / (35 - 10) = 1$.\n  $v_2(T2) = (10 - 10) / (35 - 10) = 0$.\n  $v_2(T3) = (20 - 10) / (35 - 10) = 10 / 25 = 0.4$.\n\n- **Criterion 3 (Injury reduction, $x_3$):** Values are $\\{8, 5, 12\\}$. $\\min(x_3) = 5$, $\\max(x_3) = 12$.\n  $v_3(T1) = (8 - 5) / (12 - 5) = 3/7 \\approx 0.4286$.\n  $v_3(T2) = (5 - 5) / (12 - 5) = 0$.\n  $v_3(T3) = (12 - 5) / (12 - 5) = 1$.\n\n- **Criterion 4 ($\\mathrm{CO}_2$ reduction, $x_4$):** Values are $\\{110, 180, 150\\}$. $\\min(x_4) = 110$, $\\max(x_4) = 180$.\n  $v_4(T1) = (110 - 110) / (180 - 110) = 0$.\n  $v_4(T2) = (180 - 110) / (180 - 110) = 1$.\n  $v_4(T3) = (150 - 110) / (180 - 110) = 40 / 70 = 4/7 \\approx 0.5714$.\n\n- **Criterion 5 (Equity improvement, $x_5$):** Values are $\\{0.08, 0.12, 0.15\\}$. $\\min(x_5) = 0.08$, $\\max(x_5) = 0.15$.\n  $v_5(T1) = (0.08 - 0.08) / (0.15 - 0.08) = 0$.\n  $v_5(T2) = (0.12 - 0.08) / (0.15 - 0.08) = 0.04 / 0.07 = 4/7 \\approx 0.5714$.\n  $v_5(T3) = (0.15 - 0.08) / (0.15 - 0.08) = 1$.\n\n**2. Elicitation of Criterion Weights, $w_k$**\n\nThe stakeholder swing scores are given as $S_1=30$, $S_2=25$, $S_3=20$, $S_4=10$, $S_5=15$. The total score is $\\sum_k S_k = 30 + 25 + 20 + 10 + 15 = 100$. The weights $w_k$ are found by normalizing these scores to sum to $1$:\n$$w_k = \\frac{S_k}{\\sum_j S_j}$$\n- $w_1 = 30 / 100 = 0.30$ ($\\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$)\n- $w_2 = 25 / 100 = 0.25$ (Physical activity)\n- $w_3 = 20 / 100 = 0.20$ (Injury reduction)\n- $w_4 = 10 / 100 = 0.10$ ($\\mathrm{CO}_2$ reduction)\n- $w_5 = 15 / 100 = 0.15$ (Equity)\n\n**3. Computation of Overall Value, $V$**\n\nThe overall value for each policy is $V(T_j) = \\sum_{k=1}^5 w_k v_k(T_j)$.\n\n- **Policy $T1$**:\n$V(T1) = w_1 v_1(T1) + w_2 v_2(T1) + w_3 v_3(T1) + w_4 v_4(T1) + w_5 v_5(T1)$\n$V(T1) = (0.30)(0) + (0.25)(1) + (0.20)(3/7) + (0.10)(0) + (0.15)(0)$\n$V(T1) = 0 + 0.25 + 0.6/7 \\approx 0.25 + 0.08571 = 0.33571... \\approx 0.336$\n\n- **Policy $T2$**:\n$V(T2) = w_1 v_1(T2) + w_2 v_2(T2) + w_3 v_3(T2) + w_4 v_4(T2) + w_5 v_5(T2)$\n$V(T2) = (0.30)(1) + (0.25)(0) + (0.20)(0) + (0.10)(1) + (0.15)(4/7)$\n$V(T2) = 0.30 + 0 + 0 + 0.10 + 0.6/7 \\approx 0.40 + 0.08571 = 0.48571... \\approx 0.486$\n\n- **Policy $T3$**:\n$V(T3) = w_1 v_1(T3) + w_2 v_2(T3) + w_3 v_3(T3) + w_4 v_4(T3) + w_5 v_5(T3)$\n$V(T3) = (0.30)(0.5) + (0.25)(0.4) + (0.20)(1) + (0.10)(4/7) + (0.15)(1)$\n$V(T3) = 0.15 + 0.10 + 0.20 + 0.4/7 + 0.15$\n$V(T3) = 0.60 + 4/70 \\approx 0.60 + 0.05714 = 0.65714... \\approx 0.657$\n\n**Ranking of Policies**:\nBased on the overall values, $V(T3) > V(T2) > V(T1)$. The ranking is $T3 \\succ T2 \\succ T1$.\n\n**4. Alignment with HiAP Principles**\nThe process described aligns with the Health in All Policies (HiAP) approach by:\n- **Intersectoral Collaboration**: Involving a panel with representatives from public health, transport, environment, urban planning, and the community.\n- **Evidence-Informed and Transparent Decision-Making**: Using a formal, quantitative method (MCDA) that makes trade-offs explicit through weights and documents the evidence (outcome data).\n- **Health Equity as a Goal**: Explicitly including an equity criterion and assigning it a significant weight, thus integrating equity considerations directly into the decision.\n- **Co-benefits**: The framework is explicitly designed to evaluate multiple co-benefits (air quality, physical activity, safety, climate, equity) simultaneously.\n- **Accountability**: The structured process creates a traceable record of how the decision was made. The problem's mention of ex-ante and ex-post evaluation reinforces this.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Use min–max normalization $v_{k}(x_{k}) = \\dfrac{x_{k} - \\min(x_{k})}{\\max(x_{k}) - \\min(x_{k})}$ computed over $\\{T1,T2,T3\\}$ for each criterion; compute weights by normalizing the swing scores to $w = (0.30, 0.25, 0.20, 0.10, 0.15)$. Then $V(T1) \\approx 0.336$, $V(T2) \\approx 0.486$, $V(T3) \\approx 0.657$, giving $T3 \\succ T2 \\succ T1$. Stakeholder involvement includes an intersectoral panel (health, transport, environment, planning) plus community representatives, explicit equity consideration via a criterion and its weight, transparent documentation, and plans for ex-ante and ex-post evaluation.**\n- This option correctly identifies min-max normalization as the appropriate method.\n- It correctly normalizes the swing scores to obtain the weights $w = (0.30, 0.25, 0.20, 0.10, 0.15)$.\n- It correctly computes the overall values $V(T1) \\approx 0.336$, $V(T2) \\approx 0.486$, and $V(T3) \\approx 0.657$.\n- It correctly determines the ranking $T3 \\succ T2 \\succ T1$.\n- Its description of stakeholder involvement and governance is fully consistent with HiAP principles and the details provided in the problem.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Use ratio-to-maximum normalization $v_{k}(x_{k}) = \\dfrac{x_{k}}{\\max(x_{k})}$ for all criteria; assign equal weights $w_{k} = 0.20$; compute $V(T1) \\approx 0.682$, $V(T2) \\approx 0.701$, $V(T3) \\approx 0.841$, ranking $T3 \\succ T2 \\succ T1$. Stakeholder involvement is limited to transport and finance agencies to streamline decisions, with no public health or community participation.**\n- The choice of ratio-to-maximum normalization is less consistent with the swing weighting setup, which focuses on the range from worst to best.\n- Assigning equal weights ($w_k=0.20$) is incorrect; it ignores the explicit stakeholder swing scores provided.\n- The description of stakeholder involvement directly contradicts the problem statement and the core tenets of HiAP.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Use min–max normalization but set weights directly equal to the swing scores $w = (30, 25, 20, 10, 15)$ without normalization; compute $V(T1) \\approx 33.6$, $V(T2) \\approx 48.6$, $V(T3) \\approx 65.7$ and declare $T2$ best because it has the largest single-criterion performance on $\\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$ reduction; stakeholder involvement includes public health and transport only.**\n- Setting weights equal to raw scores is incorrect; the model requires weights that sum to $1$.\n- Declaring $T2$ as the winner based on a single criterion violates the fundamental purpose of MCDA, which is to aggregate across all criteria according to their respective importance.\n- The description of stakeholder involvement is an incorrect simplification of the panel described in the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Use min–max normalization for most criteria but invert injury reduction so $v_{3}(x_{3}) = 1 - \\dfrac{x_{3} - \\min(x_{3})}{\\max(x_{3}) - \\min(x_{3})}$; normalize weights to $w = (0.30, 0.25, 0.20, 0.10, 0.15)$; compute $V(T1) \\approx 0.249$, $V(T2) \\approx 0.571$, $V(T3) \\approx 0.512$, ranking $T2 \\succ T3 \\succ T1$. Stakeholder involvement emphasizes transparency but drops the equity criterion to avoid “politicization.”**\n- The inversion of the value function for injury reduction is incorrect. The problem states that all criteria are oriented so \"larger values are better,\" meaning $v_k(x_k)$ must be an increasing function of $x_k$. Inverting the function violates this requirement.\n- Dropping the equity criterion contradicts the problem data and violates a key principle of the HiAP approach.\n- The computed V values are incorrect, even under the flawed assumption of an inverted value function.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5002826"}]}
