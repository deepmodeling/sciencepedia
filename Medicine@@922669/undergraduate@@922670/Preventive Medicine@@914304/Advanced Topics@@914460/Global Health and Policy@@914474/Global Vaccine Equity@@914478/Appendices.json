It is a standard application of the Concentration Index, a widely used metric in public health and health economics to quantify socioeconomic inequality in health outcomes. All necessary data are provided and are consistent.\n\nThe Concentration Index ($CI$) provides a measure of inequality in a health variable (in this case, vaccine coverage) across the distribution of a socioeconomic variable (wealth quintiles). The core definition of the $CI$ relates to the concentration curve, which plots the cumulative proportion of the health variable against the cumulative proportion of the population, ranked from lowest to highest socioeconomic status. The $CI$ is defined as twice the area between the concentration curve, $L(p)$, and the line of perfect equality, $y=p$. The line of equality represents the scenario where each fraction of the population holds the same fraction of the health variable.\n\nFor grouped data, as provided in this problem, the $CI$ can be calculated using a formula derived from this geometric definition. The area under the concentration curve is approximated using the trapezoidal rule. The formula for the $CI$ is:\n$$CI = 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{T} p_k (L_{k-1} + L_k)$$\nwhere:\n- $T$ is the number of socioeconomic groups (quintiles, so $T=5$).\n- $p_k$ is the population share of group $k$.\n- $L_k$ is the cumulative share of the health variable held by the cumulative proportion of the population up to group $k$. $L_0$ is defined as $0$.\n\nThe steps to compute the $CI$ are as follows:\n\n1.  **Define and tabulate the given variables.**\n    The population is divided into $T=5$ quintiles, so the population share for each is $p_k = 1/5 = 0.2$ for $k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$.\n    The vaccine coverage rates, $\\mu_k$, for each quintile are given as proportions:\n    $\\mu_1 = 0.60$ (lowest quintile)\n    $\\mu_2 = 0.65$\n    $\\mu_3 = 0.70$\n    $\\mu_4 = 0.75$\n    $\\mu_5 = 0.80$ (highest quintile)\n\n2.  **Calculate the overall mean vaccine coverage, $\\mu$.**\n    The mean coverage is the weighted average of the quintile-specific coverage rates. Since all quintiles have equal population shares, this is the simple arithmetic mean.\n    $$ \\mu = \\sum_{k=1}^{5} p_k \\mu_k = (0.2)(0.60) + (0.2)(0.65) + (0.2)(0.70) + (0.2)(0.75) + (0.2)(0.80) $$\n    $$ \\mu = 0.2 \\times (0.60 + 0.65 + 0.70 + 0.75 + 0.80) = 0.2 \\times (3.50) = 0.70 $$\n\n3.  **Calculate the cumulative shares of the health variable, $L_k$.**\n    The cumulative share $L_k$ is the cumulative sum of the health variable amount (coverage $\\times$ population share) up to group $k$, divided by the total amount of the health variable in the population (which is $\\mu$).\n    $$ L_k = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i \\mu_i}{\\mu} $$\n    We can build a table to organize these calculations.

This is termed **pro-rich** inequality.\n    - A negative $CI$ indicates that the health variable is concentrated among the lower socioeconomic groups (the poor). This is termed **pro-poor** inequality.\n    - A $CI$ of $0$ indicates perfect equality.\n\n    Since our calculated $CI = \\frac{2}{35}$ is a positive value, the inequality in vaccine coverage is **pro-rich**.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n#### Part 1: Derivation of $R_e(R_0, p, VE)$\n\nThe effective reproduction number, $R_e$, is defined as the average number of secondary infections caused by a single infectious individual in a population that is not entirely susceptible. It relates to the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, through the fraction of the population that is susceptible, $s$. The core relationship is:\n$$R_e = R_0 \\cdot s$$\nIn a completely naive population where everyone is susceptible, $s=1$ and thus $R_e = R_0$. Vaccination serves to reduce the overall susceptibility of the population.\n\nWe are given a random vaccination program with coverage $p$. This divides the population into two groups:\n$1$. A fraction $(1-p)$ of the population is unvaccinated. Assuming no prior natural immunity, their susceptibility is maximal, which we normalize to $1$.\n$2$. A fraction $p$ of the population is vaccinated.\n\nThe vaccine is described as \"leaky\" with an efficacy $VE$. Vaccine efficacy ($VE$) against infection is the proportionate reduction in the rate of infection among vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals. If the susceptibility of an unvaccinated individual is $S_{unvac} = 1$, and the susceptibility of a vaccinated individual is $S_{vac}$, then $VE$ is defined as:\n$$VE = \\frac{S_{unvac} - S_{vac}}{S_{unvac}}$$\nSubstituting $S_{unvac} = 1$, we can solve for the residual susceptibility of a vaccinated individual:\n$$VE = \\frac{1 - S_{vac}}{1} \\implies S_{vac} = 1 - VE$$\nThis result aligns with the description of a leaky vaccine reducing susceptibility by a multiplicative factor; a vaccinated individual has their susceptibility reduced *to* a fraction $(1-VE)$ of the baseline.\n\nThe effective susceptible fraction of the entire population, $s$, is the weighted average of the susceptibilities of the two subgroups (unvaccinated and vaccinated), weighted by their respective proportions in the population.\n$$s = (\\text{fraction unvaccinated}) \\times (\\text{susceptibility of unvaccinated}) + (\\text{fraction vaccinated}) \\times (\\text{susceptibility of vaccinated})$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the fractions and susceptibilities:\n$$s = (1-p) \\cdot 1 + p \\cdot (1 - VE)$$\nSimplifying the expression for $s$:\n$$s = 1 - p + p - p \\cdot VE$$\n$$s = 1 - p \\cdot VE$$\nThis expression represents the average susceptibility of the population as a function of vaccine coverage and efficacy.\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $s$ back into the primary equation for $R_e$:\n$$R_e = R_0 \\cdot s = R_0 (1 - p \\cdot VE)$$\nThis is the required expression for $R_e$ as a function of $R_0$, $p$, and $VE$.\n\n#### Part 2: Derivation of minimal coverage levels $p_A^{\\ast}$ and $p_B^{\\ast}$\n\nTo halt epidemic growth, the effective reproduction number must be brought below unity, i.e., $R_e  1$. The minimal (or critical) vaccination coverage, denoted $p^{\\ast}$, is the coverage required to achieve the threshold condition $R_e = 1$. We set our derived expression for $R_e$ to $1$:\n$$1 = R_0 (1 - p^{\\ast} \\cdot VE)$$\nWe now solve for $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{R_0} = 1 - p^{\\ast} \\cdot VE$$\n$$p^{\\ast} \\cdot VE = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}}{VE}$$\nThis can be rewritten with a common denominator in the numerator:\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0}}{VE} = \\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0 \\cdot VE}$$\nThis is the general formula for the critical vaccination coverage required to achieve herd immunity. Any coverage $p > p^{\\ast}$ will result in $R_e  1$.\n\nNow, we apply this formula to the specific parameters for Region A and Region B.\n\nFor Region A:\nWe are given $R_{0,A} = 3$. The minimal coverage $p_A^{\\ast}$ is:\n$$p_A^{\\ast} = \\frac{R_{0,A} - 1}{R_{0,A} \\cdot VE} = \\frac{3 - 1}{3 \\cdot VE} = \\frac{2}{3 \\cdot VE}$$\n\nFor Region B:\nWe are given $R_{0,B} = 5$. The minimal coverage $p_B^{\\ast}$ is:\n$$p_B^{\\ast} = \\frac{R_{0,B} - 1}{R_{0,B} \\cdot VE} = \\frac{5 - 1}{5 \\cdot VE} = \\frac{4}{5 \\cdot VE}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as the row vector $(p_A^{\\ast}, p_B^{\\ast})$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{2}{3 \\cdot VE}  \\frac{4}{5 \\cdot VE}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4529255"}, {"introduction": "In the face of scarce vaccine supplies, every dose counts, and making ethical, high-impact allocation decisions is paramount.
