It is a valid, well-posed problem in quantitative social science as applied to public health.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Dissimilarity Index\nLet $p_i = a_i/A$ be the proportion of group $A$'s total population residing in tract $i$, and $q_i = b_i/B$ be the corresponding proportion for group $B$. A state of perfect integration, or zero dissimilarity, is achieved when the distribution of group $A$ across tracts is identical to that of group $B$, i.e., $p_i = q_i$ for all $i$.\n\nThe dissimilarity index, $D$, is defined as the minimum fraction of one group (say, group $A$) that needs to relocate to achieve this state of integration.\nTracts can be classified into two types: those where group $A$ is \"overrepresented\" relative to group $B$ ($p_i > q_i$) and those where it is \"underrepresented\" ($p_i  q_i$). To equalize the distributions, members of group $A$ must move from overrepresented tracts to underrepresented tracts.\n\nThe total \"excess\" proportion of group $A$ in all overrepresented tracts is the sum of the positive differences $(p_i - q_i)$. This quantity represents the total share of group $A$ that is located in tracts where their share exceeds that of group $B$. This is precisely the minimal fraction of group $A$'s total population that needs to move from these tracts to underrepresented tracts to achieve distributional equality.\nTherefore, the dissimilarity index $D$ is given by:\n$$D = \\sum_{i \\text{ where } p_i > q_i} (p_i - q_i)$$\nWe know that the sum of all proportions is unity for each group: $\\sum_i p_i = 1$ and $\\sum_i q_i = 1$. Consequently, the sum of the differences over all tracts is zero:\n$$\\sum_i (p_i - q_i) = \\sum_i p_i - \\sum_i q_i = 1 - 1 = 0$$\nThis implies that the sum of positive differences equals the absolute value of the sum of negative differences:\n$$\\sum_{i \\text{ where } p_i > q_i} (p_i - q_i) = - \\sum_{i \\text{ where } p_i  q_i} (p_i - q_i) = \\sum_{i \\text{ where } p_i  q_i} (q_i - p_i)$$\nThe sum of the absolute values of the differences is:\n$$\\sum_i |p_i - q_i| = \\sum_{i \\text{ where } p_i > q_i} (p_i - q_i) + \\sum_{i \\text{ where } p_i  q_i} (q_i - p_i) = 2 \\sum_{i \\text{ where } p_i > q_i} (p_i - q_i)$$\nFrom this, we can express the index $D$ in its most common and symmetric form:\n$$D = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i} \\left| p_i - q_i \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i} \\left| \\frac{a_i}{A} - \\frac{b_i}{B} \\right|$$\nThis is the required analytic expression for the residential dissimilarity index.\n\n### Calculation for the Given Data\nFirst, we compute the total citywide populations for groups $A$ and $B$.\n$$A = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} a_i = 1200 + 800 + 300 + 200 + 500 = 3000$$\n$$B = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} b_i = 300 + 700 + 900 + 500 + 100 = 2500$$\n\nNext, we calculate the shares $p_i = a_i/A$ and $q_i = b_i/B$ for each of the $5$ tracts.\n- **Tract 1:**\n  $p_1 = \\frac{1200}{3000} = \\frac{12}{30} = \\frac{2}{5}$\n  $q_1 = \\frac{300}{2500} = \\frac{3}{25}$\n  $|p_1 - q_1| = \\left|\\frac{2}{5} - \\frac{3}{25}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{10}{25} - \\frac{3}{25}\\right| = \\frac{7}{25}$\n\n- **Tract 2:**\n  $p_2 = \\frac{800}{3000} = \\frac{8}{30} = \\frac{4}{15}$\n  $q_2 = \\frac{700}{2500} = \\frac{7}{25}$\n  $|p_2 - q_2| = \\left|\\frac{4}{15} - \\frac{7}{25}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{20}{75} - \\frac{21}{75}\\right| = \\frac{1}{75}$\n\n- **Tract 3:**\n  $p_3 = \\frac{300}{3000} = \\frac{3}{30} = \\frac{1}{10}$\n  $q_3 = \\frac{900}{2500} = \\frac{9}{25}$\n  $|p_3 - q_3| = \\left|\\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{9}{25}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{5}{50} - \\frac{18}{50}\\right| = \\frac{13}{50}$\n\n- **Tract 4:**\n  $p_4 = \\frac{200}{3000} = \\frac{2}{30} = \\frac{1}{15}$\n  $q_4 = \\frac{500}{2500} = \\frac{5}{25} = \\frac{1}{5}$\n  $|p_4 - q_4| = \\left|\\frac{1}{15} - \\frac{1}{5}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{1}{15} - \\frac{3}{15}\\right| = \\frac{2}{15}$\n\n- **Tract 5:**\n  $p_5 = \\frac{500}{3000} = \\frac{5}{30} = \\frac{1}{6}$\n  $q_5 = \\frac{100}{2500} = \\frac{1}{25}$\n  $|p_5 - q_5| = \\left|\\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{25}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{25}{150} - \\frac{6}{150}\\right| = \\frac{19}{150}$\n\nNow, we sum these absolute differences. Using a common denominator of $150$:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{5} |p_i - q_i| = \\frac{7}{25} + \\frac{1}{75} + \\frac{13}{50} + \\frac{2}{15} + \\frac{19}{150}$\n$= \\frac{42}{150} + \\frac{2}{150} + \\frac{39}{150} + \\frac{20}{150} + \\frac{19}{150} = \\frac{42+2+39+20+19}{150} = \\frac{122}{150} = \\frac{61}{75}$\n\nFinally, we compute the index $D$:\n$$D = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{5} |p_i - q_i| = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{61}{75}\\right) = \\frac{61}{150}$$\nAs a decimal, $D = 0.40666...$. Rounding to four significant figures, we get $0.4067$.\n\n### Relation to Access to Preventive Services\nA high value of the dissimilarity index, such as the calculated $D \\approx 0.4067$, indicates a high degree of residential segregation. When preventive service sites are allocated in proportion to the total population of each tract ($T_i = a_i + b_i$), the spatial distribution of services may not align with the spatial distribution of a specific group, particularly if that group is residentially segregated. A high index value implies that the distributions of group $A$, $\\\\{p_i\\\\}$, and group $B$, $\\\\{q_i\\\\}$, are substantially different from each other. At least one of these distributions (and likely both) must also differ from the distribution of the total population, $\\\\{T_i/T\\\\}$, which dictates the allocation of services. This spatial mismatch means that members of a group may live predominantly in tracts that receive a smaller share of services than would be proportional to that group's population in those tracts, creating a structural barrier to access. Therefore, a higher dissimilarity index quantifies a structural condition that can lead to inequities in access to spatially-dependent resources like preventive health services.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.4067}\n$$", "id": "4576487"}, {"introduction": "As public health increasingly relies on data-driven tools to target interventions, we face a new challenge: ensuring these tools do not perpetuate the very inequities we aim to solve.

Let $Y_i(1)$ be the potential outcome (ACSC hospitalization rate) for unit $i$ if it receives the treatment, and $Y_i(0)$ be the potential outcome if it does not receive the treatment. The units in this problem are neighborhoods. Let $D_g$ be an indicator variable where $D_g=1$ for the treated group ($g=\\text{treated}$) and $D_g=0$ for the control group ($g=\\text{control}$). Let $T_t$ be an indicator variable for the time period, where $T_t=1$ for the post-intervention period ($t=\\text{post}$) and $T_t=0$ for the pre-intervention period ($t=\\text{pre}$).\n\nThe parameter of interest is the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT), defined as the expected effect of the treatment on the group that actually received it. In the post-intervention period, this is:\n$$ATT = E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) | D_g=1, T_t=1]$$\nThis expression can be separated into two terms:\n$$ATT = E[Y_i(1) | D_g=1, T_t=1] - E[Y_i(0) | D_g=1, T_t=1]$$\nThe first term, $E[Y_i(1) | D_g=1, T_t=1]$, is the expected outcome for the treated group in the post-intervention period, given they were treated. This is directly observable from the data. Its sample analog is the average outcome for the treated group in the post-intervention period, denoted as $Y_{\\text{post},\\text{treated}}$.\n$$E[Y_i(1) | D_g=1, T_t=1] \\rightarrow Y_{\\text{post},\\text{treated}}$$\nThe second term, $E[Y_i(0) | D_g=1, T_t=1]$, is the expected outcome for the treated group in the post-intervention period *had they not been treated*. This is the counterfactual outcome and is unobservable.\n\nTo estimate this unobservable counterfactual, we invoke the **common trends assumption**, also known as the parallel trends assumption. This assumption states that, in the absence of the treatment, the average change in the outcome over time would have been the same for both the treated and control groups. Formally:\n$$E[Y_i(0) | D_g=1, T_t=1] - E[Y_i(0) | D_g=1, T_t=0] = E[Y_i(0) | D_g=0, T_t=1] - E[Y_i(0) | D_g=0, T_t=0]$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the counterfactual term:\n$$E[Y_i(0) | D_g=1, T_t=1] = E[Y_i(0) | D_g=1, T_t=0] + \\left( E[Y_i(0) | D_g=0, T_t=1] - E[Y_i(0) | D_g=0, T_t=0] \\right)$$\nNow we relate the terms on the right-hand side to the observed data:\n- $E[Y_i(0) | D_g=1, T_t=0]$: The expected outcome for the treated group in the pre-intervention period. Since no treatment had occurred, this is their observed outcome, $Y_{\\text{pre},\\text{treated}}$.\n- $E[Y_i(0) | D_g=0, T_t=1]$: The expected outcome for the control group in the post-intervention period. Since the control group is never treated, this is their observed outcome, $Y_{\\text{post},\\text{control}}$.\n- $E[Y_i(0) | D_g=0, T_t=0]$: The expected outcome for the control group in the pre-intervention period. This is their observed outcome, $Y_{\\text{pre},\\text{control}}$.\n\nSubstituting these observed quantities into the expression for the counterfactual gives our estimate for the unobserved term:\n$$\\widehat{E}[Y_i(0) | D_g=1, T_t=1] = Y_{\\text{pre},\\text{treated}} + (Y_{\\text{post},\\text{control}} - Y_{\\text{pre},\\text{control}})$$\nFinally, we substitute this back into the ATT equation to get the DiD estimator, which we denote as $\\hat{\\delta}_{ATT}$:\n$$\\hat{\\delta}_{ATT} = Y_{\\text{post},\\text{treated}} - \\widehat{E}[Y_i(0) | D_g=1, T_t=1]$$\n$$\\hat{\\delta}_{ATT} = Y_{\\text{post},\\text{treated}} - [Y_{\\text{pre},\\text{treated}} + (Y_{\\text{post},\\text{control}} - Y_{\\text{pre},\\text{control}})]$$\nRearranging the terms yields the standard DiD formula:\n$$\\hat{\\delta}_{ATT} = (Y_{\\text{post},\\text{treated}} - Y_{\\text{pre},\\text{treated}}) - (Y_{\\text{post},\\text{control}} - Y_{\\text{pre},\\text{control}})$$\nThis estimator is the difference in the change in outcomes for the treated group, adjusted for the change in outcomes that occurred over the same period in the control group.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n- $Y_{\\text{pre},\\text{treated}} = 42.0$\n- $Y_{\\text{post},\\text{treated}} = 31.6$\n- $Y_{\\text{pre},\\text{control}} = 35.5$\n- $Y_{\\text{post},\\text{control}} = 33.9$\n\nFirst, calculate the change in outcome for the treated group:\n$$\\Delta Y_{\\text{treated}} = Y_{\\text{post},\\text{treated}} - Y_{\\text{pre},\\text{treated}} = 31.6 - 42.0 = -10.4$$\nNext, calculate the change in outcome for the control group:\n$$\\Delta Y_{\\text{control}} = Y_{\\text{post},\\text{control}} - Y_{\\text{pre},\\text{control}} = 33.9 - 35.5 = -1.6$$\nThe DiD estimate is the difference between these two changes:\n$$\\hat{\\delta}_{ATT} = \\Delta Y_{\\text{treated}} - \\Delta Y_{\\text{control}} = -10.4 - (-1.6) = -10.4 + 1.6 = -8.8$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $-8.8$. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $-8.80$. The units are ACSC hospitalization events per $1{,}000$ adults. The negative sign indicates a reduction in the rate attributable to the intervention.\n\nPart 2: Testing the Parallel Trends Assumption\n\nThe validity of the DiD estimator hinges on the parallel trends assumption. This assumption is not directly testable for the post-intervention period, but its plausibility can be assessed by examining trends in the pre-intervention period, provided data from multiple pre-intervention years are available.\n\nThe formal null hypothesis for this test is that the trend in the outcome variable is the same for both the treatment and control groups during the pre-intervention period.\n\nA regression specification can be used to formally test this hypothesis. Using data only from the pre-intervention years, we can fit the following model:\n$$Y_{g,t} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 D_g + \\beta_2 t + \\beta_3 (D_g \\times t) + \\epsilon_{g, t}$$\nwhere:\n- $Y_{g,t}$ is the ACSC rate for group $g$ in pre-intervention time period $t$.\n- $D_g$ is the treatment group indicator ($1$ for treated group, $0$ for control).\n- $t$ is a continuous variable for time (e.g., year).\n- $D_g \\times t$ is an interaction term between the treatment group and time.\n- $\\epsilon_{g,t}$ is the error term.\n\nIn this model, the coefficient $\\beta_2$ captures the time trend for the control group ($D_g=0$), and $\\beta_2 + \\beta_3$ represents the time trend for the treatment group ($D_g=1$). The coefficient of interest is $\\beta_3$, which measures the difference in trends between the two groups. The null hypothesis for the parallel trends test is therefore $H_0: \\beta_3 = 0$. A failure to reject this null hypothesis (i.e., a p-value for $\\beta_3$ that is not statistically significant) provides support for the parallel trends assumption.\n\nThe qualitative graphical pattern that would support the assumption is a plot of the average outcome ($Y_{g,t}$) against time ($t$) for both the treated and control groups, using all available pre-intervention data points. If the parallel trends assumption holds, the two lines representing the two groups should be approximately parallel during this pre-intervention period. Note that the lines do not need to be at the same level (i.e., the groups can have different baseline rates), but their slopes should be visually indistinguishable. This visual evidence complements the formal statistical test.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-8.80}\n$$", "id": "4576430"}]}
