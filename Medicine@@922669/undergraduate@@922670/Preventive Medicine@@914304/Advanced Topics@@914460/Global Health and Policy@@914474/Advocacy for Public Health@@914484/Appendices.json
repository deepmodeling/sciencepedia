We proceed with the tasks as outlined.\n\nLet $I_e$ represent the incidence of hypertension in the exposed group (individuals with obesity) and $I_u$ be the incidence in the unexposed group (individuals without obesity). The prevalence of the exposure (obesity) in the population is given by $p$.\n\nThe fundamental definitions are:\n1.  **Relative Risk ($RR$)**: The ratio of incidence in the exposed group to the incidence in the unexposed group.\n    $$RR = \\frac{I_e}{I_u}$$\n2.  **Population Incidence ($I_{pop}$)**: The overall incidence of the disease in the total population. As stated, this is the weighted average of the incidences in the exposed and unexposed subgroups.\n    $$I_{pop} = p \\cdot I_e + (1-p) \\cdot I_u$$\n3.  **Population Attributable Fraction ($PAF$)**: The proportion of the disease incidence in the total population that is due to the exposure. It is calculated as the reduction in population incidence that would occur if the exposure were eliminated, divided by the total population incidence. If the exposure were eliminated, the entire population would have the baseline incidence of the unexposed, $I_u$.\n    $$PAF = \\frac{I_{pop} - I_u}{I_{pop}}$$\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the closed-form expression for PAF**\n\nOur objective is to express $PAF$ solely in terms of $p$ and $RR$. We begin with the definition of $PAF$ and substitute the expressions for $I_{pop}$ and $I_e$.\n\nFirst, substitute the expression for $I_{pop}$ into the $PAF$ formula:\n$$PAF = \\frac{(p \\cdot I_e + (1-p) \\cdot I_u) - I_u}{p \\cdot I_e + (1-p) \\cdot I_u}$$\nSimplify the numerator:\n$$(p \\cdot I_e + I_u - p \\cdot I_u) - I_u = p \\cdot I_e - p \\cdot I_u = p(I_e - I_u)$$\nThe expression for $PAF$ becomes:\n$$PAF = \\frac{p(I_e - I_u)}{p \\cdot I_e + (1-p) \\cdot I_u}$$\nNow, we must eliminate $I_e$ and $I_u$. From the definition of $RR$, we have $I_e = RR \\cdot I_u$. We substitute this into the expression for $PAF$:\n$$PAF = \\frac{p( (RR \\cdot I_u) - I_u)}{p(RR \\cdot I_u) + (1-p) \\cdot I_u}$$\nFactor out $I_u$ from the terms in both the numerator and the denominator:\n$$PAF = \\frac{p \\cdot I_u (RR - 1)}{I_u [p \\cdot RR + (1-p)]}$$\nThe term $I_u$ is a common factor and cancels out, assuming $I_u \\neq 0$ (which is required for $RR$ to be well-defined and for the problem to be non-trivial). This cancellation is critical as it shows that $PAF$ is independent of the baseline incidence of the disease.\n$$PAF = \\frac{p(RR - 1)}{p \\cdot RR + 1 - p}$$\nThis can be rearranged into a common alternative form by factoring the denominator:\n$$PAF = \\frac{p(RR - 1)}{1 + p(RR - 1)}$$\nBoth expressions are equivalent and represent the derived closed-form solution.\n\n**Task 2: Computation of the PAF**\n\nWe are given the values $p = 0.35$ and $RR = 1.6$. We substitute these into the derived formula:\n$$PAF = \\frac{0.35(1.6 - 1)}{1 + 0.35(1.6 - 1)}$$\nFirst, calculate the term $(1.6 - 1)$:\n$$1.6 - 1 = 0.6$$\nNow, substitute this back into the expression:\n$$PAF = \\frac{0.35(0.6)}{1 + 0.35(0.6)}$$\nCalculate the products in the numerator and denominator:\n$$PAF = \\frac{0.21}{1 + 0.21} = \\frac{0.21}{1.21}$$\nPerforming the final division:\n$$PAF \\approx 0.173553719...$$\nThe problem requires rounding to $4$ significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $7$, $3$, and $5$. The fifth digit is a $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$PAF \\approx 0.1736$$\n\n**Task 3: Conceptual Difference between PAF and Attributable Risk (AR)**\n\nAttributable Risk, $AR = I_e - I_u$, is the absolute excess incidence in the exposed group compared to the unexposed group, measuring the burden of disease among those with the risk factor. In contrast, the Population Attributable Fraction, $PAF = \\frac{I_{pop} - I_u}{I_{pop}}$, is the proportion of a disease in the total population that is attributable to the risk factor, making it more useful for public health advocacy because it quantifies the potential impact of a population-wide intervention by incorporating both the risk factor's prevalence ($p$) and the strength of its association with the disease ($RR$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1736}$$", "id": "4502632"}, {"introduction": "Once a public health issue is identified, advocates often face a choice between several potential policy solutions, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of public health and epidemiology, specifically the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) framework. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and definitions for a unique solution. The language is objective and quantitative. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe primary objective is to compute the total Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) averted by a public health policy. According to the GBD framework definition provided, the DALY is the sum of Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to premature mortality and Years Lived with Disability (YLD) due to morbidity.\nThe total DALYs averted, denoted as $DALY_{averted}$, can be expressed as:\n$$DALY_{averted} = YLL_{averted} + YLD_{averted}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total YLL averted.

The disability weight is a factor on a scale from $0$ (perfect health) to $1$ (equivalent to death).\nThe total YLD averted is the product of the number of cases averted, the duration of each case, and the disability weight. The problem instruction to not truncate durations at the end of the $10$-year period means we use the full episode duration for the calculation.\n$$YLD_{averted} = N_{cases} \\times d \\times DW$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$YLD_{averted} = 1,000 \\times 2 \\times 0.2$$\n$$YLD_{averted} = 1,000 \\times 0.4 = 400 \\text{ years}$$\n\nFinally, to find the total DALYs averted, we sum the YLL and YLD components.\n$$DALY_{averted} = YLL_{averted} + YLD_{averted}$$\n$$DALY_{averted} = 5000 + 400$$\n$$DALY_{averted} = 5400 \\text{ years}$$\n\nThe $10$-year period mentioned in the problem statement is the time frame during which the $200$ deaths and $1,000$ cases are averted.
