Define the potential outcome $Y_{gt}(1)$ as the influenza-associated hospitalization rate (per $100{,}000$ population) that would be observed for group $g$ at time $t$ if the policy were implemented, and $Y_{gt}(0)$ as the rate if the policy were not implemented.

The analysis is based on a quasi-experimental design involving a treated group and a control group, observed before and after a policy intervention.\n\nFirst, we define the parameter of interest. The average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) is the expected effect of the policy on the group that actually received it ($g=\\text{treated}$), in the period when they received it ($t=\\text{post}$). Using the potential outcomes framework, the ATT, denoted as $\\tau_{\\text{ATT}}$, is defined as the difference between the expected potential outcome under treatment and the expected potential outcome under no treatment, for the treated group in the post-policy period:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{ATT}} = E[Y_{\\text{treated, post}}(1) - Y_{\\text{treated, post}}(0)]\n$$\nHere, $Y_{\\text{treated, post}}(1)$ is the potential outcome for the treated group in the post period with the policy, and $Y_{\\text{treated, post}}(0)$ is the potential outcome for the same group and period without the policy.\n\nThe core challenge in estimating $\\tau_{\\text{ATT}}$ is that the term $E[Y_{\\text{treated, post}}(0)]$ represents a counterfactual state; we cannot observe what would have happened to the treated group in the post-policy period if they had not received the treatment. The DID method allows us to estimate this counterfactual quantity using the available data and a key assumption.\n\nThe observed outcomes are related to the potential outcomes as follows:\n- For the treated group in the post period: $E[\\bar{Y}_{\\text{treated, post}}] = E[Y_{\\text{treated, post}}(1)]$.\n- For the treated group in the pre period (no policy): $E[\\bar{Y}_{\\text{treated, pre}}] = E[Y_{\\text{treated, pre}}(0)]$.\n- For the control group in the post period (no policy): $E[\\bar{Y}_{\\text{control, post}}] = E[Y_{\\text{control, post}}(0)]$.\n- For the control group in the pre period (no policy): $E[\\bar{Y}_{\\text{control, pre}}] = E[Y_{\\text{control, pre}}(0)]$.\n\nThe problem states to assume the parallel trends condition holds for untreated potential outcomes. This assumption posits that, in the absence of the policy, the expected change in the outcome from the pre-policy period to the post-policy period would have been the same for both the treated and control groups. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\nE[Y_{\\text{treated, post}}(0) - Y_{\\text{treated, pre}}(0)] = E[Y_{\\text{control, post}}(0) - Y_{\\text{control, pre}}(0)]\n$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the unobservable counterfactual term, $E[Y_{\\text{treated, post}}(0)]$:\n$$\nE[Y_{\\text{treated, post}}(0)] = E[Y_{\\text{treated, pre}}(0)] + E[Y_{\\text{control, post}}(0)] - E[Y_{\\text{control, pre}}(0)]\n$$\nThis equation provides an expression for the expected outcome of the treated group in the post-period had they not received the treatment. It is constructed from the treated group's baseline level ($E[Y_{\\text{treated, pre}}(0)]$) plus the secular trend observed in the control group ($E[Y_{\\text{control, post}}(0)] - E[Y_{\\text{control, pre}}(0)]$).\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for the counterfactual back into the definition of $\\tau_{\\text{ATT}}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{ATT}} = E[Y_{\\text{treated, post}}(1)] - \\left( E[Y_{\\text{treated, pre}}(0)] + E[Y_{\\text{control, post}}(0)] - E[Y_{\\text{control, pre}}(0)] \\right)\n$$\nThe DID estimator, $\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{DID}}$, is the sample analog of this expression, where we replace the expectations with the observed sample means, denoted by $\\bar{Y}_{gt}$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{DID}} = \\bar{Y}_{\\text{treated, post}} - \\left( \\bar{Y}_{\\text{treated, pre}} + \\bar{Y}_{\\text{control, post}} - \\bar{Y}_{\\text{control, pre}} \\right)\n$$\nRearranging the terms yields the standard formula for the DID estimator:\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{DID}} = (\\bar{Y}_{\\text{treated, post}} - \\bar{Y}_{\\text{treated, pre}}) - (\\bar{Y}_{\\text{control, post}} - \\bar{Y}_{\\text{control, pre}})\n$$\nThis expression represents the difference in the change over time for the treated group minus the change over time for the control group.\n\nWe now compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n- Treated region, pre-policy ($\\bar{Y}_{\\text{treated, pre}}$): $22.4$\n- Treated region, post-policy ($\\bar{Y}_{\\text{treated, post}}$): $16.1$\n- Control region, pre-policy ($\\bar{Y}_{\\text{control, pre}}$): $20.7$\n- Control region, post-policy ($\\bar{Y}_{\\text{control, post}}$): $19.8$\n\nFirst, calculate the change in hospitalization rates for the treated group:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{treated}} = \\bar{Y}_{\\text{treated, post}} - \\bar{Y}_{\\text{treated, pre}} = 16.1 - 22.4 = -6.3\n$$\nNext, calculate the change in hospitalization rates for the control group. This represents the secular trend that would have affected both groups in the absence of the policy.\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{control}} = \\bar{Y}_{\\text{control, post}} - \\bar{Y}_{\\text{control, pre}} = 19.8 - 20.7 = -0.9\n$$\nFinally, compute the DID estimator by subtracting the control group's change from the treated group's change:\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{DID}} = \\Delta_{\\text{treated}} - \\Delta_{\\text{control}} = (-6.3) - (-0.9) = -6.3 + 0.9 = -5.4\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The result is $-5.40$. The negative sign indicates that the policy is estimated to have caused a decrease in the influenza-associated hospitalization rate. The magnitude of the effect is a reduction of $5.40$ hospitalizations per $100{,}000$ population for the treated region, compared to what would have been expected without the policy, according to this model.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-5.40}\n$$", "id": "4566513"}, {"introduction": "A crucial assumption for the validity of any Difference-in-Differences analysis is the \"parallel trends\" assumption, which posits that the treatment and control groups would have followed similar trajectories in the absence of the policy.

To probe whether the estimated association for respiratory admissions could be driven by residual confounding rather than a causal effect, the division proposes a falsification test using a negative control outcome: adult orthopedic hospital admissions per $100{,}000$ population per month, which, under standard clinical knowledge, is unlikely to be affected by indoor smoking restrictions in the short run.\n\nAssume the following foundational base:\n- In the potential outcomes framework, for unit $i$ at time $t$, the causal effect is defined as the contrast between the potential outcomes $Y_{it}(1)$ under treatment and $Y_{it}(0)$ under no treatment. A quasi-experimental difference-in-differences design identifies the average treatment effect on the treated under the parallel trends assumption, which states that, absent treatment, the treated and comparison groups would have experienced the same change over time in the expected outcome.\n- A valid negative control outcome $Z$ satisfies $Z_{it}(1) = Z_{it}(0)$ for all $i$ and $t$; therefore, any estimated treatment effect on $Z$ should be $0$ if identification conditions hold.\n\nThe division collected monthly adult orthopedic admission rates per $100{,}000$ for $6$ pre-policy months and $6$ post-policy months.
