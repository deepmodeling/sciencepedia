In the absence of screening, the baseline cumulative risk of the condition over ten years is denoted by $p_0$ and is known to be $p_0 = 0.2$. Evidence from randomized community trials indicates that, compared with no screening, the screening program produces a Relative Risk (RR) of $RR = 0.75$ for developing the condition over the same period.\n\nUsing only the following foundational definitions from preventive medicine and health policy:\n- Relative Risk (RR) is defined as $RR = \\frac{p_1}{p_0}$, where $p_1$ is the risk under the intervention and $p_0$ is the baseline risk.\n- Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) is defined as $ARR = p_0 - p_1$.\n- Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is defined as $NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$.\n\nDerive an expression for $NNT$ in terms of $p_0$ and $RR$ starting from these definitions, and then compute the numerical value of $NNT$ for the given parameters $p_0 = 0.2$ and $RR = 0.75$.

It is scientifically grounded in established epidemiological principles, self-contained, and well-posed. The provided data ($p_0 = 0.2$, $RR = 0.75$) and definitions are consistent and sufficient for a unique solution. The problem requires the derivation of an expression and a subsequent numerical calculation, which is a standard task in quantitative sciences.\n\nThe objective is to first derive an expression for the Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$) in terms of the baseline risk, $p_0$, and the Relative Risk, $RR$. Subsequently, this expression will be used to compute the numerical value of $NNT$ for the given parameters.\n\nThe problem provides the following foundational definitions:\n1.  Relative Risk ($RR$): $RR = \\frac{p_1}{p_0}$, where $p_1$ is the risk under the intervention and $p_0$ is the baseline risk.\n2.  Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$): $ARR = p_0 - p_1$.\n3.  Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$): $NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$. In the context of a screening program, this can be interpreted as the Number Needed to Screen.\n\nOur derivation begins with the definition of $NNT$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nWe can substitute the definition of $ARR$ into this equation:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{p_0 - p_1}$$\nThe current expression for $NNT$ depends on $p_0$ and $p_1$. The problem requires an expression in terms of $p_0$ and $RR$. Therefore, we must eliminate $p_1$. We can achieve this by using the definition of $RR$. From the definition $RR = \\frac{p_1}{p_0}$, we can express $p_1$ as:\n$$p_1 = p_0 \\cdot RR$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $p_1$ back into our equation for $NNT$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{p_0 - (p_0 \\cdot RR)}$$\nFactoring out the common term $p_0$ in the denominator yields the desired expression for $NNT$ in terms of $p_0$ and $RR$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{p_0 (1 - RR)}$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nFor the second part, we must compute the numerical value of $NNT$ using the given parameters: $p_0 = 0.2$ and $RR = 0.75$. We substitute these values into our derived formula:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.2 \\cdot (1 - 0.75)}$$\nFirst, we evaluate the term in the parentheses:\n$$1 - 0.75 = 0.25$$\nSubstituting this result back into the equation for $NNT$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.2 \\cdot 0.25}$$\nNext, we compute the product in the denominator:\n$$0.2 \\cdot 0.25 = \\frac{2}{10} \\cdot \\frac{25}{100} = \\frac{50}{1000} = 0.05$$\nFinally, we calculate the value of $NNT$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.05} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{5}{100}} = \\frac{100}{5} = 20$$\nTherefore, the Number Needed to Treat (or Screen) is $20$.

In health policy evaluation for preventive medicine, the objective is to allocate limited resources to maximize health benefits, commonly quantified using the Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY).

All necessary data are provided, and the objective is clear and formalizable.\n\nThe task is to compare two health policies, annual screening and biennial screening, on the basis of their cost-effectiveness. In health economics, when one policy is both more costly and more effective than a comparator, the standard method of evaluation is the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). This measure quantifies the additional cost required to gain one additional unit of health benefit. The problem explicitly requires the derivation of this measure from its underlying principles.\n\nLet us denote the annual screening policy as Policy A and the biennial screening policy as Policy B.

The problem requires us to evaluate annual screening (Policy A) relative to biennial screening (Policy B).\n\nFirst, we observe that Policy A is more expensive than Policy B ($C_A  C_B$) and also more effective ($E_A  E_B$). This is the standard condition under which an incremental analysis is performed. A policy that is less effective and more expensive would be \"dominated\" and discarded without further calculation. A policy that is more effective and less expensive would be \"dominant\" and clearly preferred. Neither of those simple cases applies here.\n\nThe core principle is to evaluate the *additional* cost incurred for the *additional* health benefit gained by choosing the more intensive policy (annual screening) over the less intensive one (biennial screening).\n\nThe incremental cost, denoted as $\\Delta C$, is the difference between the cost of Policy A and the cost of Policy B.\n$$ \\Delta C = C_A - C_B $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\Delta C = 200 - 120 = 80 \\text{ USD} $$\n\nThe incremental health effect, denoted as $\\Delta E$, is the difference between the health effect of Policy A and the health effect of Policy B.\n$$ \\Delta E = E_A - E_B $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\Delta E = 0.003 - 0.0022 = 0.0008 \\text{ QALY} $$\n\nThe appropriate incremental measure, which we have derived from first principles, is the ratio of the incremental cost to the incremental health effect.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of quasi-experimental design for policy evaluation, specifically the difference-in-differences method, which is a standard technique in fields such as econometrics, epidemiology, and health policy. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and assumptions (stable unit treatment value assumption, parallel trends) to compute a unique and meaningful solution. The language is objective and the data are plausible.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of a healthy food subsidy policy on the one-year change in Body Mass Index (BMI). The difference-in-differences (DiD) method is specified for this purpose. The DiD estimator isolates the causal effect of an intervention by comparing the change in an outcome over time between a treated group and a control group. The core assumption, parallel trends, posits that in the absence of the treatment, the change in the outcome for the treated group would have been identical to the change observed in the control group.\n\nLet $Y$ represent the outcome variable, which is defined as the \"average one-year change in BMI\". The units of $Y$ are $\\text{kg}/\\text{m}^2$.\nLet $T$ be an indicator variable for the treatment group, where $T=1$ for the treated counties and $T=0$ for the control counties.\nLet $P$ be an indicator variable for the time period, where $P=1$ for the post-policy period and $P=0$ for the pre-policy period.\n\nThe provided data are the expected values (means) of the outcome $Y$ for each group and period:\n- Treated, pre-policy mean change: $E[Y|T=1, P=0] = -0.1$\n- Treated, post-policy mean change: $E[Y|T=1, P=1] = -0.6$\n- Control, pre-policy mean change: $E[Y|T=0, P=0] = -0.05$\n- Control, post-policy mean change: $E[Y|T=0, P=1] = -0.2$\n\nThe DiD estimator, $\\hat{\\delta}_{DiD}$, provides an estimate of the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT). In the context of this problem, it is referred to as the ATE. The formula for the DiD estimator is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\delta}_{DiD} = \\left( E[Y|T=1, P=1] - E[Y|T=1, P=0] \\right) - \\left( E[Y|T=0, P=1] - E[Y|T=0, P=0] \\right)\n$$\nThis formula represents the difference in the change over time for the treated group and the change over time for the control group. The change over time for the control group serves as the counterfactual for the treated group, i.e., what would have happened to the treated group without the policy, under the parallel trends assumption.\n\nFirst, we calculate the change in the outcome for the treated group:\n$$\n\\Delta_{Treated} = E[Y|T=1, P=1] - E[Y|T=1, P=0] = -0.6 - (-0.1) = -0.6 + 0.1 = -0.5\n$$\nThis value, $-0.5\\ \\text{kg}/\\text{m}^2$, represents the observed pre-post change in the \"one-year BMI change\" for the counties that received the policy.\n\nNext, we calculate the change in the outcome for the control group:\n$$\n\\Delta_{Control} = E[Y|T=0, P=1] - E[Y|T=0, P=0] = -0.2 - (-0.05) = -0.2 + 0.05 = -0.15\n$$\nThis value, $-0.15\\ \\text{kg}/\\text{m}^2$, represents the secular trend, i.e., the change that occurred in the absence of the policy.\n\nFinally, the DiD estimate is the difference between these two changes:\n$$\n\\hat{\\delta}_{DiD} = \\Delta_{Treated} - \\Delta_{Control} = -0.5 - (-0.15) = -0.5 + 0.15 = -0.35\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $-0.35$. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $-0.350$.\n\nThe resulting ATE is $-0.350\\ \\text{kg}/\\text{m}^2$.\n\nInterpretation:\n- **Sign**: The negative sign indicates that the policy had a reductive effect on the outcome. Since a lower BMI is generally considered a positive health outcome in the context of overweight/obesity prevention, the negative sign signifies a beneficial impact.\n- **Magnitude**: The magnitude of the effect is $0.350\\ \\text{kg}/\\text{m}^2$. This means that the healthy food subsidy policy caused an additional reduction in the average one-year BMI change of $0.350\\ \\text{kg}/\\text{m}^2$ over and above the trend that would have occurred without the policy. In other words, while BMI was already on a downward trend in both groups (as indicated by the negative changes in the control group), the policy significantly accelerated this reduction in the treated counties.
