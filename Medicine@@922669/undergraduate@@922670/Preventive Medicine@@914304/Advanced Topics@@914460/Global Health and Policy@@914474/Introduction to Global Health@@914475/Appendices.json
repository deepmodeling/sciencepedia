In settings from remote clinics to outbreak response centers, clinicians must rapidly assess the likelihood of disease to guide treatment and triage. This exercise demonstrates how to move beyond a test's simple \"positive\" or \"negative\" result by using likelihood ratios to update our initial clinical suspicion, a process grounded in Bayesian reasoning. By calculating post-test probabilities, you will learn a core skill in evidence-based medicine that is critical for making informed patient-level decisions, especially when resources are scarce [@problem_id:4542355].", "problem": "In a resource-limited clinic responding to a rapidly evolving outbreak of an infectious disease, a triage protocol uses a single rapid diagnostic test to prioritize isolation and treatment. The clinical team estimates the pretest probability (the probability of disease before testing) for patients meeting a symptom-and-exposure case definition as $0.30$. The rapid test has a positive likelihood ratio (LR) of $LR^{+} = 8$ and a negative likelihood ratio of $LR^{-} = 0.2$. Starting from Bayes' theorem and the core definitions of odds and likelihood ratios, derive the posttest probability of disease after a positive result and after a negative result.

First, we must validate the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Pretest probability of disease, $P(\\text{D}) = 0.30$.\n- Positive likelihood ratio, $LR^{+} = 8$.\n- Negative likelihood ratio, $LR^{-} = 0.2$.\n- Decision threshold for immediate isolation and treatment is a posttest probability of $0.50$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, utilizing established principles of Bayesian inference as applied in clinical epidemiology. The concepts of pretest probability, likelihood ratios, and posttest probability are fundamental to evidence-based medicine. The provided numerical values are plausible for a moderately effective diagnostic test. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to calculate the required probabilities. The language is objective and precise. The problem is free from logical contradictions, factual inaccuracies, or other flaws.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. We may proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe solution will be derived from the core relationship between probability and odds, and the odds form of Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has the disease, and $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have the disease. Let $T+$ be the event of a positive test result and $T-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe probability of an event $A$, denoted $P(A)$, can be converted to odds, denoted $\\text{Odds}(A)$, using the formula:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(A) = \\frac{P(A)}{1 - P(A)} = \\frac{P(A)}{P(A^c)} $$\nConversely, probability can be recovered from odds using:\n$$ P(A) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}(A)}{1 + \\text{Odds}(A)} $$\n\nThe pretest probability of disease is given as $P(D) = 0.30$. The pretest odds are therefore:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{P(D)}{1 - P(D)} = \\frac{0.30}{1 - 0.30} = \\frac{0.30}{0.70} = \\frac{3}{7} $$\n\nBayes' theorem in its odds form states that the posttest odds are the product of the pretest odds and the likelihood ratio (LR) for the given test result.\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} \\times \\text{LR} $$\n\n**1. Posttest Probability after a Positive Result ($P(D|T+)$)**\n\nFor a positive test result, we use the positive likelihood ratio, $LR^{+} = 8$. The posttest odds for disease are:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post},+} = \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} \\times LR^{+} $$\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post},+} = \\frac{3}{7} \\times 8 = \\frac{24}{7} $$\n\nNow, we convert these posttest odds back into a probability, which gives the posttest probability of disease given a positive test, $P(D|T+)$:\n$$ P(D|T+) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post},+}}{1 + \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post},+}} = \\frac{24/7}{1 + 24/7} = \\frac{24/7}{31/7} = \\frac{24}{31} $$\nAs a decimal rounded to $4$ significant figures, this is:\n$$ P(D|T+) \\approx 0.7741935... \\approx 0.7742 $$\n\n**2. Posttest Probability after a Negative Result ($P(D|T-)$)**\n\nFor a negative test result, we use the negative likelihood ratio, $LR^{-} = 0.2$. The posttest odds for disease are:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post},-} = \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} \\times LR^{-} $$\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post},-} = \\frac{3}{7} \\times 0.2 = \\frac{3}{7} \\times \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{3}{7} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{3}{35} $$\n\nConverting these posttest odds back into a probability gives the posttest probability of disease given a negative test, $P(D|T-)$:\n$$ P(D|T-) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post},-}}{1 + \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post},-}} = \\frac{3/35}{1 + 3/35} = \\frac{3/35}{38/35} = \\frac{3}{38} $$\nAs a decimal rounded to $4$ significant figures, this is:\n$$ P(D|T-) \\approx 0.0789473... \\approx 0.07895 $$\n\n**3. Interpretation for Triage Decisions**\n\nThe decision threshold for immediate isolation and treatment is a posttest probability of $0.50$.\n- For a patient with a **positive test result**, the posttest probability of disease is $P(D|T+) \\approx 0.7742$. Since $0.7742 > 0.50$, this patient's probability of disease exceeds the threshold. Therefore, this individual should be prioritized for immediate isolation and treatment. The test result significantly increased the probability of disease from the pretest value of $0.30$.\n- For a patient with a **negative test result**, the posttest probability of disease is $P(D|T-) \\approx 0.07895$. Since $0.07895  0.50$, this patient's probability of disease is well below the threshold. The negative test result has substantially reduced the probability of disease from the pretest value of $0.30$. This individual would not be prioritized for immediate isolation and treatment and could be managed as a lower-risk case.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.7742  0.07895\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4542355"}, {"introduction": "After identifying and diagnosing health issues, the next step in global health is to implement interventions and measure their success.

The problem provides the relative risk reduction ($RRR$), which is defined in terms of the baseline and intervention incidence rates:\n$$RRR = \\frac{IR_{baseline} - IR_{intervention}}{IR_{baseline}}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $IR_{intervention}$:\n$$IR_{intervention} = IR_{baseline} \\times (1 - RRR)$$\nSubstituting the given values $IR_{baseline} = 1.2$ and $RRR = 0.3$:\n$$IR_{intervention} = 1.2 \\times (1 - 0.3) = 1.2 \\times 0.7 = 0.84 \\frac{\\text{episodes}}{\\text{person-year}}$$\n\nThe expected number of cases with the intervention, $C_{intervention}$, is the product of the new incidence rate ($IR_{intervention}$) and the total person-time ($PT$).\n$$C_{intervention} = IR_{intervention} \\times PT$$\n$$C_{intervention} = 0.84 \\frac{\\text{episodes}}{\\text{person-year}} \\times 5,000 \\text{ person-years} = 4,200 \\text{ episodes}$$\n\nFinally, the number of cases averted is the difference between $C_{baseline}$ and $C_{intervention}$:\n$$C_{averted} = C_{baseline} - C_{intervention} = 6,000 - 4,200 = 1,800 \\text{ episodes}$$\n\nAlternatively, and more directly, the number of cases averted can be conceptualized as the total person-time multiplied by the absolute reduction in the incidence rate.

The objectives are clearly defined using standard formulas, and the decision rule is explicit. The comparison of intervention B to A is appropriate because B is both more costly ($C_B > C_A$) and more effective ($E_B > E_A$), placing it in the upper-right quadrant of the cost-effectiveness plane relative to A, which is the domain where ICER is the relevant decision metric.

The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the calculation of three quantities and one decision indicator.\n\n**1. Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio ($\\operatorname{ICER}_{B:A}$)**\n\nThe ICER quantifies the additional cost per unit of additional health benefit gained when moving from one intervention (the comparator, A) to another (the proposed intervention, B). The formula is:\n$$ \\operatorname{ICER}_{B:A} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{C_B - C_A}{E_B - E_A} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$C_A = 100$\n$E_A = 2$\n$C_B = 160$\n$E_B = 3$\n$$ \\operatorname{ICER}_{B:A} = \\frac{160 - 100}{3 - 2} = \\frac{60}{1} = 60 $$\nThe units are thousands of $2024$ USD per QALY. Rounding to four significant figures, the result is $60.00$.\n\n**2. Net Monetary Benefit (NMB)**\n\nThe NMB translates the health outcomes (QALYs) into monetary terms using the willingness-to-pay threshold ($\\lambda$) and subtracts the cost. It represents the net value of an intervention in monetary units. The formula for an intervention $i$ is:\n$$ \\operatorname{NMB}_i = (\\lambda \\times E_i) - C_i $$\nThe given willingness-to-pay threshold is $\\lambda = 50$.\n\n- **NMB for Intervention A ($\\operatorname{NMB}_A$)**:\n$$ \\operatorname{NMB}_A = (\\lambda \\times E_A) - C_A = (50 \\times 2) - 100 = 100 - 100 = 0 $$\nThe value is exactly $0$.\n\n- **NMB for Intervention B ($\\operatorname{NMB}_B$)**:\n$$ \\operatorname{NMB}_B = (\\lambda \\times E_B) - C_B = (50 \\times 3) - 160 = 150 - 160 = -10 $$\nThe value is $-10$. Rounding to four significant figures gives $-10.00$.\n\n**3. Preferred Option ($P$)**\n\nThe decision rule is to select the intervention with the larger NMB.\n- $\\operatorname{NMB}_A = 0$\n- $\\operatorname{NMB}_B = -10$\n\nComparing the two values, we find that $\\operatorname{NMB}_A > \\operatorname{NMB}_B$ since $0 > -10$. Therefore, intervention A is the preferred option. According to the problem definition, if intervention A is preferred, the indicator $P$ is set to $0$.\nSo, $P=0$.\n\nThis result is consistent with the comparison of the ICER to the willingness-to-pay threshold. Since $\\operatorname{ICER}_{B:A} = 60$ is greater than $\\lambda = 50$, the additional cost per QALY for choosing B over A exceeds the maximum amount the health system is willing to pay for an additional QALY. Thus, the more expensive intervention B is not considered cost-effective compared to A at this threshold, and A is preferred.\n\n**4.
