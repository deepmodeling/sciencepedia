The problem is a valid application of basic calculus and algebraic manipulation to a simplified model used in climate science and public health policy.\n\nThe derivation of the expression for the mean annual per-capita emissions, $e$, proceeds as follows.\n\nLet $E(t)$ be the annual global $\\text{CO}_2$ emissions in gigatonnes of carbon dioxide per year (GtCO$_2$/year) at time $t$, where $t$ is measured in years from the start of the phaseout period.

This can be written as $I = k(1 - L)$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality representing the total upstream production, which is assumed to be constant.\n\nAt baseline, we have intake $I_{0} = 300$ g/day and loss fraction $L_{0} = 0.20$.\n$$I_{0} = k(1 - L_{0})$$\nThe policy intervention reduces the loss fraction by an absolute amount $\\Delta L = 0.05$.

The harm term correctly incorporates the change in normalized pressure ($\\Delta I_k$), the conversion factor to DALYs ($h_k$), and the policy weights ($w_k$) specified for the multi-criteria evaluation. This is a complete and coherent framework using all provided parameters.\nLet's compute the value based on this criterion. The total weighted harm is:\n$$ \\sum_{k} h_k \\, w_k \\, \\Delta I_k = (h_{\\text{climate}} \\, w_{\\text{climate}} \\, \\Delta I_{\\text{climate}}) + (h_N \\, w_N \\, \\Delta I_N) $$\n$$ = (5,000 \\times 0.6 \\times 0.103) + (2,000 \\times 0.4 \\times 0.1) $$\n$$ = (3,000 \\times 0.103) + (800 \\times 0.1) $$\n$$ = 309 + 80 = 389 \\text{ DALY} $$\nThe net DALY benefit is:\n$$ \\text{Net Benefit} = \\Delta D - 389 \\text{ DALY} = 450 \\text{ DALY} - 389 \\text{ DALY} = 61 \\text{ DALY} $$\nSince the result ($61$) is greater than $0$, the intervention yields a net planetary health benefit under this criterion.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Example: Mass vaccination of poultry reduces zoonoses, and because vaccines are biotechnological products, they automatically relax all planetary boundary pressures via innovation. Criterion: subtract raw tonnes of mixed pollutants directly from DALY reduction, $$\\Delta D - (\\Delta E_{\\text{CO}_2\\text{e}} + \\Delta N),$$ and accept if the result is positive.**\nThe example is factually incorrect. Mass vaccination is a different intervention. The claim that biotechnology \"automatically\" relaxes environmental pressures is unfounded pseudoscience; production and logistics of vaccines have an environmental footprint. The criterion is dimensionally nonsensical as it subtracts tonnes of pollutants from DALYs, which is mathematically and physically meaningless.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Example: Sealed barns reduce spillover but increase $\\text{CO}_2\\text{e}$. Criterion: apply a hard threshold to the climate boundary only: if $$\\frac{U_{\\text{climate},1}}{B_{\\text{climate}}} < 1,$$ the intervention is beneficial; otherwise it is harmful, irrespective of health gains or other boundaries.**\nThe example is an incomplete description, omitting the nitrogen impact. The criterion is a \"strong sustainability\" rule, which is a valid ethical position, but it fails to perform a \"net benefit\" analysis as requested. It ignores the direct DALY benefit, the nitrogen boundary, and the magnitude of the boundary transgression. Let's check the condition:\n$$ U_{\\text{climate},1} = U_{\\text{climate},0} + \\Delta U_{\\text{climate}} = 900,000 + 103,000 = 1,003,000 \\text{ tonnes/year} $$\n$$ \\frac{U_{\\text{climate},1}}{B_{\\text{climate}}} = \\frac{1,003,000}{1,000,000} = 1.003 $$\nSince $1.003 > 1$, this criterion would reject the intervention. However, it does so without weighing the costs and benefits, contrary to the goal of evaluating the \"net planetary health benefit.\"\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Example: Composting reduces zoonoses; any reduction in outbreak probability implies benefit. Criterion: accept the intervention if $p_1 < p_0$, regardless of environmental impacts.**\nThe example is highly incomplete, ignoring the main biosecurity intervention and all environmental costs. The criterion is fundamentally at odds with the principles of One Health and planetary health, as it considers only the direct human health benefit and completely ignores the ecosystem/environmental dimension of the problem. Given $p_1 = 0.005$ and $p_0 = 0.02$, the condition $p_1 < p_0$ is met, but accepting the intervention based on this alone is a violation of the integrated approach required.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the analysis, Option A is the only choice that presents a scientifically consistent example, uses a dimensionally correct and comprehensive criterion that integrates all the data provided in the problem statement, and correctly performs the net benefit calculation as requested. The calculation shows a net benefit of $61$ DALYs, meaning the intervention is beneficial under this specific multi-criteria framework.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4556251"}]}
