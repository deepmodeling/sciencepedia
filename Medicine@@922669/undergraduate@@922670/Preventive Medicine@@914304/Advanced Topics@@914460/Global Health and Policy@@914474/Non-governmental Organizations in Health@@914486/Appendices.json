It is a standard application of conditional probability principles fundamental to epidemiology and biostatistics. All necessary information is provided, and the given values are realistic. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution can be derived.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that an individual has the latent infectious condition, and let $D^c$ be the event that the individual does not have the condition. Let $T^+$ denote a positive test result and $T^-$ denote a negative test result.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following information:\n1.  The prevalence of the condition, which is the prior probability of an individual having the condition: $P(D) = 0.05$.\n2.

The specificity of the test, which is the probability of a negative test result given that the individual does not have the condition: $P(T^-|D^c) = 0.95$.\n\nFrom these givens, we can derive other essential probabilities.\n- The probability of not having the condition is the complement of the prevalence: $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$.\n- The false negative rate is the probability of a negative test given the individual has the condition: $P(T^-|D) = 1 - P(T^+|D) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n- The false positive rate is the probability of a positive test given the individual does not have the condition: $P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n\nThe task is to compute the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and the Negative Predictive Value (NPV).\n\n**1. Calculation of the Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\n\nThe PPV is the probability that an individual has the condition given that they have received a positive test result, which is denoted as $P(D|T^+)$. Using the definition of conditional probability, which is a formulation of Bayes' theorem:\n$$\nPPV = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D)P(D)}{P(T^+)}\n$$\nThe numerator, $P(T^+|D)P(D)$, represents the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive (true positives).\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the overall probability of receiving a positive test result. It can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:\n$$\nP(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)\n$$\nThis sums the probability of true positives and false positives.\n\nSubstituting the given and derived values into the equation for $P(T^+)$:\n$$\nP(T^+) = (0.90)(0.05) + (0.05)(0.95)\n$$\n$$\nP(T^+) = 0.045 + 0.0475 = 0.0925\n$$\nNow, we can calculate the PPV:\n$$\nPPV = \\frac{0.045}{0.0925} \\approx 0.48648648...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $PPV = 0.4865$.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\n\nThe NPV is the probability that an individual does not have the condition given that they have received a negative test result, denoted as $P(D^c|T^-)$. Using the definition of conditional probability:\n$$\nNPV = P(D^c|T^-) = \\frac{P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}\n$$\nThe numerator, $P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c)$, represents the joint probability of not having the disease and testing negative (true negatives).\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the overall probability of receiving a negative test result. Using the Law of Total Probability:\n$$\nP(T^-) = P(T^-|D)P(D) + P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c)\n$$\nThis sums the probability of false negatives and true negatives.\n\nSubstituting the values into the equation for $P(T^-)$:\n$$\nP(T^-) = (0.10)(0.05) + (0.95)(0.95)\n$$\n$$\nP(T^-) = 0.005 + 0.9025 = 0.9075\n$$\nNote that $P(T^-) + P(T^+) = 0.9075 + 0.0925 = 1.00$, as expected.\n\nNow, we can calculate the NPV:\n$$\nNPV = \\frac{0.9025}{0.9075} \\approx 0.99449035...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $NPV = 0.9945$.\n\n**3. Interpretation for Program Decision-Making**\n\nThe computed values have direct and critical implications for the NGO's screening program strategy.\n\n-   **PPV Interpretation**: A $PPV$ of $0.4865$ means that among all individuals who test positive, only $48.65\\%$ actually have the condition. Conversely, a majority ($1 - 0.4865 = 0.5135$ or $51.35\\%$) of positive results are false positives. This relatively low PPV is a classic consequence of screening for a low-prevalence condition, even with a reasonably good test.\n    -   **Programmatic Implication**: A positive result from this screening test is insufficient to confirm a diagnosis. Acting upon a positive test alone (e.g., initiating treatment, mandating isolation) would be inappropriate and harmful to the more than half of positive-testing individuals who are healthy. Therefore, it is mandatory to implement a two-step strategy. The NGO must plan for a confirmatory diagnostic test, which should ideally have a very high specificity, for every individual who screens positive. The budget, logistics, and patient counseling protocols must account for this essential second step.\n\n-   **NPV Interpretation**: An $NPV$ of $0.9945$ means that among all individuals who test negative, $99.45\\%$ are truly free of the condition.\n    -   **Programmatic Implication**: A negative test result is highly reliable and can be used to confidently rule out the condition in the screened population. This is a key strength of the screening program. It allows the NGO to efficiently and effectively reassure the vast majority of the community, allowing resources and follow-up activities to be concentrated exclusively on the much smaller group of individuals who test positive and require confirmatory testing. The high NPV makes the test an effective tool for population-level risk stratification.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.4865  0.9945 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4552805"}, {"introduction": "Beyond evaluating individual programs, NGO leaders face the complex challenge of allocating a fixed budget across multiple worthy initiatives, often balancing the goals of maximizing overall health gains with ensuring fairness for vulnerable groups.
