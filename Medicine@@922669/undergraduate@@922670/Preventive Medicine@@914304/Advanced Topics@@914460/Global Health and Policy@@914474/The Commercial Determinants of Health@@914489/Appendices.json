This exercise grounds this concept in a core economic principle: price elasticity of demand, which quantifies how sensitive consumption is to price changes. By working through this problem, you will learn to calculate the impact of a price-based policy on consumption, a vital skill for evaluating public health interventions such as soda taxes [@problem_id:4582668].", "problem": "A public health agency is evaluating how price policies that target unhealthy commodities influence consumption, an example of the commercial determinants of health. In a given jurisdiction, the baseline average retail price per unit of a sugary beverage is $P_0 = 10$ (in currency units), and the baseline per-capita consumption is $C_0 = 10$ units per person per month.

It is scientifically grounded in the economic principles of supply and demand, specifically the concept of price elasticity. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data—baseline price ($P_0$), baseline consumption ($C_0$), price elasticity of demand ($\\epsilon$), and the magnitude of the price change—to compute a unique solution for the new consumption level ($C_1$). The provided values are realistic and internally consistent.\n\nThe core of the problem is to derive the relationship between price and consumption from the definition of own-price elasticity of demand, $\\epsilon$, under the assumption that this elasticity is constant. The fundamental definition of point elasticity is the ratio of the infinitesimal proportional change in quantity demanded, $C$, to the infinitesimal proportional change in price, $P$.\n\nThis is expressed mathematically as:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{dC/C}{dP/P} = \\frac{P}{C} \\frac{dC}{dP} $$\n\nThe problem specifies that $\\epsilon$ is constant. This allows us to treat the definition as a separable first-order ordinary differential equation and solve it to find the functional form of the demand curve, $C(P)$. We rearrange the terms to separate the variables $C$ and $P$:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{C} = \\epsilon \\frac{dP}{P} $$\n\nTo find the change in consumption from a baseline state $(C_0, P_0)$ to a new state $(C_1, P_1)$, we integrate both sides of the equation over the respective intervals:\n$$ \\int_{C_0}^{C_1} \\frac{1}{C} dC = \\int_{P_0}^{P_1} \\epsilon \\frac{1}{P} dP $$\n\nSince $\\epsilon$ is a constant, it can be moved outside the integral on the right-hand side:\n$$ \\int_{C_0}^{C_1} \\frac{1}{C} dC = \\epsilon \\int_{P_0}^{P_1} \\frac{1}{P} dP $$\n\nEvaluating the definite integrals yields:\n$$ [\\ln(C)]_{C_0}^{C_1} = \\epsilon [\\ln(P)]_{P_0}^{P_1} $$\n$$ \\ln(C_1) - \\ln(C_0) = \\epsilon (\\ln(P_1) - \\ln(P_0)) $$\n\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, we can simplify the expression:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_1}{C_0}\\right) = \\epsilon \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_0}\\right) $$\n\nUsing another property of logarithms, $k \\ln(a) = \\ln(a^k)$, we obtain:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_1}{C_0}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_0}\\right)^\\epsilon\\right) $$\n\nBy taking the exponential of both sides, we eliminate the logarithms and arrive at the desired expression linking the new consumption to the initial state and the price change:\n$$ \\frac{C_1}{C_0} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_0}\\right)^\\epsilon $$\n$$ C_1 = C_0 \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_0}\\right)^\\epsilon $$\nThis equation represents a constant-elasticity demand function.\n\nNow, we proceed to compute the numerical value for $C_1$. The given values are:\nBaseline price, $P_0 = 10$.\nBaseline consumption, $C_0 = 10$.\nOwn-price elasticity of demand, $\\epsilon = -0.6$.\n\nThe price increases by $10\\%$. The new price, $P_1$, is therefore:\n$$ P_1 = P_0 \\times (1 + 0.10) = 10 \\times 1.1 = 11 $$\n\nWe can now substitute these numerical values into the derived expression for $C_1$:\n$$ C_1 = 10 \\left(\\frac{11}{10}\\right)^{-0.6} $$\n$$ C_1 = 10 \\times (1.1)^{-0.6} $$\n\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$ C_1 = 10 \\times \\frac{1}{(1.1)^{0.6}} $$\n$$ C_1 \\approx 10 \\times 0.94440503 $$\n$$ C_1 \\approx 9.4440503 $$\n\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ C_1 \\approx 9.444 $$\nThe new per-capita consumption is approximately $9.444$ units per person per month.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9.444}$$", "id": "4582668"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the actions of a single firm, the overall structure of a market is a key determinant of health.

The formula for the HHI is:\n$$ \\text{HHI} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} S_i^2 $$\nwhere $N$ is the number of firms in the market, and $S_i$ is the market share of firm $i$, expressed as a percentage (i.e., a number from $0$ to $100$). Using percentages directly yields the HHI on the standard DOJ scale of $0$ to $10,000$.\n\nThe problem provides the market shares as fractional values for the $N=4$ firms:\n- $s_1 = 0.40$\n- $s_2 = 0.30$\n- $s_3 = 0.20$\n- $s_4 = 0.10$\n\nTo use the standard HHI formula for the $10,000$-point scale, these fractional shares must first be converted into percentage points by multiplying by $100$:\n- $S_1 = s_1 \\times 100 = 0.40 \\times 100 = 40$\n- $S_2 = s_2 \\times 100 = 0.30 \\times 100 = 30$\n- $S_3 = s_3 \\times 100 = 0.20 \\times 100 = 20$\n- $S_4 = s_4 \\times 100 = 0.10 \\times 100 = 10$\n\nNow, we substitute these percentage values into the HHI formula:\n$$ \\text{HHI} = S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 + S_4^2 $$\n$$ \\text{HHI} = 40^2 + 30^2 + 20^2 + 10^2 $$\n\nWe compute the square of each term:\n- $40^2 = 1600$\n- $30^2 = 900$\n- $20^2 = 400$\n- $10^2 = 100$\n\nSumming these values gives the HHI:\n$$ \\text{HHI} = 1600 + 900 + 400 + 100 = 3000 $$\nThe calculated HHI for this market is $3000$.\n\nNext, we categorize the market concentration level using the provided DOJ thresholds:\n- Unconcentrated: $\\text{HHI} < 1500$\n- Moderately concentrated: $1500 \\le \\text{HHI} \\le 2500$\n- Highly concentrated: $\\text{HHI} > 2500$\n\nOur calculated value is $\\text{HHI} = 3000$.

The boundary test evaluates three criteria: intent (denote as $I$), materiality (denote as $M$), and plausible health impact pathways (denote as $P$). The core definitions available to you as foundational bases are the following: (i) the commercial determinants of health are the systems, practices, and pathways through which commercial actors influence health, often by shaping environments, norms, and policies in pursuit of profit; (ii) intent $I$ is inferred from the alignment of an action with a firm’s commercial objectives (e.g., market share, brand equity, policy access), even if the action is framed as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR); (iii) materiality $M$ requires evidence that the action changes exposures or behaviors in a non-trivial way (e.g., measurable increases in product availability, marketing exposure, or sales), distinct from the dollar magnitude of the donation; (iv) plausible health impact pathways $P$ require a causally coherent chain from the action to health outcomes via recognized mechanisms (e.g., marketing exposure increasing Sugar-Sweetened Beverage (SSB) consumption, or built environment changes influencing physical activity), consistent with well-tested facts that higher SSB consumption increases cardiometabolic risk and that increased physical activity decreases such risk.\n\nScenario: A large soda company, SodaCo, donates $\\$2,000,000$ to renovate city parks.

The concept of \"commercial determinants of health\" is an established academic and policy framework. The definitions provided for intent, materiality, and pathways are consistent with the literature in this field. The linkages between SSB consumption, physical activity, and health outcomes are based on robust scientific evidence. The problem is scientifically grounded.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear analytical framework (the $I, M, P$ boundary test) and sufficient specific data in the scenario to apply this framework. The task is to perform a classification based on these rules, for which a determinate answer can be derived.\n- **Objective**: The language used is objective and analytical. The scenario, though hypothetical, is constructed with concrete, quantifiable data points and plausible corporate behaviors, avoiding subjective or biased framing.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-structured exercise in applying a defined set of principles to a specific case, which is a standard method of reasoning in scientific and analytical disciplines. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to apply the three criteria of the boundary test—Intent ($I$), Materiality ($M$), and Plausible Pathways ($P$)—to the given scenario.\n\n**1. Analysis of Intent ($I$)**\nThe definition states that intent is *inferred* from the alignment of an action with a firm's commercial objectives, and it is not contingent on an explicit admission. We must assess if SodaCo's \"donation\" aligns with its commercial objectives.\n- **Naming Rights**:\nSecuring naming rights for 10 years is a long-term marketing strategy to enhance brand equity and public goodwill. This is a core commercial objective.\n- **Exclusive Vending Rights & Kiosks**:\nGaining exclusive vending rights and installing 20 branded kiosks are actions that directly drive sales and increase market share within a specific, high-traffic geography. This is a primary commercial objective.\n- **Branded Signage**:\nIntegrating brand signage into park fixtures, including playgrounds, serves to normalize the brand and create positive associations, especially among children and families. This is a marketing objective. The $15,000,000$ brand impressions are a direct measure of the success of this objective.\n- **Advisory Council Seat**:\nA seat on the Parks and Wellness Advisory Council provides direct access to policymakers. This allows the company to influence future policies, regulations, and public-private partnerships in its favor, which is a strategic commercial objective.\n\nSince the action's conditions are replete with elements that align with SodaCo's commercial objectives of marketing, sales, and policy influence, the criterion for **Intent ($I$) is met**.\n\n**2. Analysis of Materiality ($M$)**\nThe definition requires non-trivial changes in exposures or behaviors, distinct from the donation's dollar value ($\\$2,000,000$).\n- **Change in Exposure**: The scenario reports $X=15,000,000$ additional local brand impressions. This is a large, measurable, and therefore non-trivial increase in marketing exposure. The addition of 20 kiosks and pervasive signage represents a material change to the park environment.\n- **Change in Behavior**: The scenario reports two key behavioral changes:\n    1. An 8% year-over-year increase in SSB unit sales within a $1\\,\\mathrm{km}$ radius of the parks. This is a non-trivial, measurable change in purchasing behavior.\n    2. An increase of 2 SSB servings per week among local adolescents. This is a direct, non-trivial change in consumption behavior.\n\nThe evidence shows that the action materially altered both marketing exposure and health-related behaviors. Therefore, the criterion for **Materiality ($M$) is met**.\n\n**3. Analysis of Plausible Health Impact Pathways ($P$)**\nThe definition requires a causally coherent chain from the action to health outcomes via recognized mechanisms. The problem notes two such chains.\n- **Pathway 1 (Negative Health Impact)**: `SodaCo's Action` $\\rightarrow$ `Increased SSB Availability & Marketing Exposure` $\\rightarrow$ `Increased SSB Consumption` (evidenced by sales and adolescent survey data) $\\rightarrow$ `Increased Risk of Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes` (established scientific fact). This is a coherent and evidenced causal pathway.\n- **Pathway 2 (Positive Health Impact)**: `SodaCo's Action (Park Renovation)` $\\rightarrow$ `Improved Park Environment` $\\rightarrow$ `Increased Physical Activity` (evidenced by observational and self-report data) $\\rightarrow$ `Reduced Cardiometabolic Risk` (established scientific fact). This is also a coherent causal pathway.\n\nThe core definition of commercial determinants of health is concerned with the *influence* of commercial actors on health. It does not require that this influence be exclusively negative or that the net effect is harmful. The existence of at least one plausible, material pathway through which the commercial actor's practices influence health is sufficient for classification. Here, a clear pathway from the commercial practices (marketing, sales) to adverse health risks exists and is supported by data.\n\nTherefore, the criterion for **Plausible Health Impact Pathways ($P$) is met**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAll three criteria—Intent ($I$), Materiality ($M$), and Plausible Pathways ($P$)—are satisfied according to the provided definitions and scenario data. Consequently, SodaCo's donation constitutes a commercial determinant of health.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. No; philanthropic donations cannot be commercial determinants of health because they are not direct product promotion.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect based on the problem's own definitions. Definition (ii) for intent explicitly anticipates actions \"framed as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\". The definition of commercial determinants (i) is broad, including \"systems, practices, and pathways,\" which is not limited to direct promotion. The scenario is a textbook example of a practice that, while framed as philanthropy, serves commercial purposes.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Yes; philanthropic donations qualify as commercial determinants of health when they are tied to branding, market access, or policy influence that materially shifts exposure and behavior through plausible pathways, as in this scenario.**\nThis statement accurately synthesizes the application of the $I, M, P$ framework. It correctly identifies that the philanthropic \"frame\" is irrelevant when the action is \"tied to branding, market access, or policy influence\" (satisfying criterion $I$), \"materially shifts exposure and behavior\" (satisfying criterion $M$), and does so \"through plausible pathways\" (satisfying criterion $P$). Our analysis confirms that this is precisely what occurs in the scenario.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. No; because park renovations increase physical activity, any harms from higher SSB consumption are offset, placing the donation outside the commercial determinants of health.**\nThis is a flawed argument. The boundary test is for classification, not for a net health impact assessment. The existence of a plausible pathway of influence from the commercial actor is what matters for the definition of a commercial determinant, not whether that influence is counteracted by other effects. A practice that influences health does not cease to be a determinant just because another, countervailing influence exists.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. It depends on explicit disclosure of intent; without a written admission of marketing or policy aims, intent cannot be inferred, so classification is indeterminate.**\nThis statement directly contradicts definition (ii), which explicitly states that intent is \"inferred from the alignment of an action with a firm’s commercial objectives\". It does not require admission. The provided scenario gives ample evidence (naming rights, vending rights, etc.) from which to infer intent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Yes only if the donation exceeds $\\$10,000,000$; smaller donations are immaterial and thus outside the commercial determinants of health.**\nThis statement contradicts definition (iii) for materiality, which explicitly decouples materiality from the \"dollar magnitude of the donation\". Materiality is judged by the impact on exposures and behaviors, which the scenario demonstrates were non-trivial despite the donation being $\\$2,000,000$, an amount less than the arbitrary $\\$10,000,000$ threshold proposed in the option.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4582696"}]}
