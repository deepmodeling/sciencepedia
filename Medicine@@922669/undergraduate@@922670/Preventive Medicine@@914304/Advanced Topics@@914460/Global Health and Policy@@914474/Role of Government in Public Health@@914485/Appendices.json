Consider a pathogen with a Basic Reproduction Number (BRN, denoted $R_0$) and a mass vaccination campaign using a vaccine whose Vaccine Effectiveness against infection (VE) is the proportional reduction in susceptibility among vaccinated individuals relative to unvaccinated individuals. Assume homogeneous mixing, that vaccination is randomly distributed in the population, and that vaccine action is limited to reducing susceptibility to infection (that is, it does not change the infectiousness of vaccinated individuals who become infected).\n\nStarting from the core epidemiological definition that the Effective Reproduction Number (denoted $R_e$) equals the product of the Basic Reproduction Number and the average fraction of the population that remains susceptible, herd immunity is achieved when $R_e<1$. Use this principle and the above assumptions to derive the minimum vaccination coverage fraction, denoted $c_{\\min}$, required for herd immunity in terms of $R_0$ and VE.

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the minimum vaccination coverage, $c_{\\min}$, required to achieve herd immunity and then to evaluate it for the given parameters. The condition for herd immunity is that the effective reproduction number, $R_e$, must be less than $1$. The threshold for minimum coverage is therefore found by setting $R_e = 1$.\n\nThe problem states that the effective reproduction number is the product of the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, and the average fraction of the population that remains susceptible, which we will denote as $S_{avg}$.\n$$R_e = R_0 \\times S_{avg}$$\n\nWe must first determine the expression for $S_{avg}$. Let $c$ be the fraction of the population that is vaccinated. The fraction that is unvaccinated is then $(1-c)$. The population is thus divided into two groups.\n\nThe susceptibility of each group must be defined. We can set the relative susceptibility of an unvaccinated individual to $1$. The problem defines Vaccine Effectiveness, VE, as the proportional reduction in susceptibility for vaccinated individuals.
