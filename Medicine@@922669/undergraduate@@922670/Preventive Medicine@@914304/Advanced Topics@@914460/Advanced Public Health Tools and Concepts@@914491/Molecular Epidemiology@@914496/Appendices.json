To determine if the cases are epidemiologically linked, bacterial isolates from each of the five students (designated Isolate 1 through Isolate 5) are collected for genetic analysis using Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST).\n\nMLST is a method that characterizes bacterial isolates by sequencing key housekeeping genes. For each gene, known as a locus, different sequence variations are assigned unique allele numbers. The combination of allele numbers at seven standard loci (*abcZ*, *adk*, *aroE*, *fumC*, *gdh*, *pdhC*, and *pgm*) constitutes the isolate's allelic profile. Each unique allelic profile is given a distinct Sequence Type (ST) number. Therefore, isolates that share the exact same allelic profile are considered to belong to the same ST.\n\nThe allelic profiles for the five isolates are determined as follows:\n\n- **Isolate 1:** *abcZ*=3, *adk*=1, *aroE*=4, *fumC*=1, *gdh*=5, *pdhC*=9, *pgm*=2\n- **Isolate 2:** *abcZ*=3, *adk*=1, *aroE*=4, *fumC*=2, *gdh*=5, *pdhC*=9, *pgm*=2\n- **Isolate 3:** *abcZ*=3, *adk*=1, *aroE*=4, *fumC*=1, *gdh*=5, *pdhC*=9, *pgm*=2\n- **Isolate 4:** *abcZ*=3, *adk*=6, *aroE*=4, *fumC*=1, *gdh*=5, *pdhC*=9, *pgm*=2\n- **Isolate 5:** *abcZ*=3, *adk*=1, *aroE*=4, *fumC*=2, *gdh*=5, *pdhC*=9, *pgm*=2\n\nBased on this data, how many distinct Sequence Types (STs) are present among the five isolates?", "solution": "We model each isolate’s MLST allelic profile as an ordered 7-tuple in the fixed locus order $(abcZ,adk,aroE,fumC,gdh,pdhC,pgm)$.

This technique compares the DNA sequences of 1701 core genes shared among all *L. monocytogenes* isolates. The genetic relatedness is measured by the number of alleles (gene variants) that differ between any two isolates.

Using Bayes' theorem, this is expressed as:\n$$\\mathrm{PPV} = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result, which can be found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the defined terms:\n$$P(T^+) = (Se)(p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)$$\nThus, the full expression for $\\mathrm{PPV}$ is:\n$$\\mathrm{PPV} = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{Se \\cdot p + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\\mathrm{PPV} = \\frac{(0.95)(0.02)}{(0.95)(0.02) + (1 - 0.99)(1 - 0.02)}$$\n$$\\mathrm{PPV} = \\frac{0.019}{0.019 + (0.01)(0.98)}$$\n$$\\mathrm{PPV} = \\frac{0.019}{0.019 + 0.0098} = \\frac{0.019}{0.0288}$$\n$$\\mathrm{PPV} \\approx 0.659722...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\mathrm{PPV} = 0.6597$.\n\nThe Negative Predictive Value, $\\mathrm{NPV} = P(D^c | T^-)$, is the probability that an individual is truly not infected given that they have received a negative test result.

The remaining $34\\%$ are false positives. This relatively low $\\mathrm{PPV}$ is a direct consequence of the low disease prevalence ($p=0.02$). Even with a highly specific test ($Sp=0.99$), the number of uninfected individuals is so large ($98\\%$ of the population) that the small fraction of false positives ($1\\%$) generated from this group ($0.01 \\times 0.98 = 0.0098$) is a substantial portion of all positive tests. The total number of positive tests is the sum of true positives ($0.95 \\times 0.02 = 0.019$) and false positives ($0.0098$), totaling $0.0288$. The proportion of true positives is $0.019 / 0.0288 \\approx 0.66$.\nTherefore, a policy of immediate isolation based solely on a single positive test would result in the unnecessary isolation of a large number of uninfected individuals (approximately one in three people who test positive). This carries significant personal, societal, and economic costs. A more prudent and scientifically justified policy would involve a confirmatory test for all positive screening results to reduce the impact of false positives before enacting measures like isolation.\n\nThe calculated $\\mathrm{NPV}$ of $0.9990$ is extremely high. This signifies that a negative test result is highly reliable. The probability that an individual is infected despite a negative test result is $1 - \\mathrm{NPV} \\approx 1 - 0.9990 = 0.0010$, or $0.1\\%$.\nFor asymptomatic individuals, a negative result from this assay provides very strong evidence that they are not infected. Therefore, a negative test result can be confidently used to rule out infection and avoid unnecessary isolation or quarantine measures. This is a crucial function of screening in a low-prevalence setting, as it allows for the efficient allocation of public health resources and minimizes disruption to the uninfected majority of the population.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.6597  0.9990 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4549736"}]}
