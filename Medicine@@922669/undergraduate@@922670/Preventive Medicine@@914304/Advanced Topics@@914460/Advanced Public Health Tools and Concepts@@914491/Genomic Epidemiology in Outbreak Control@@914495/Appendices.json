It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary parameters and definitions are provided, and it represents a formalizable problem in genomic epidemiology.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the expected number of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences between two bacterial genomes that diverged from a common source.\n\nLet us define the parameters provided:\n- The per-site substitution rate is $\\mu$, with units of substitutions per site per year.\n- The core genome length is $L$ callable sites.\n- The elapsed time since divergence from the common source is $\\Delta t$ years.\n\nThe evolutionary scenario involves two lineages (in patient 1 and patient 2) that diverge from a common ancestor. Both lineages evolve independently for a duration of $\\Delta t$. The total evolutionary time separating the two sampled genomes is the sum of the lengths of the two branches back to their most recent common ancestor. Therefore, the total time for mutations to accumulate that distinguish the two genomes is $T = \\Delta t + \\Delta t = 2\\Delta t$.\n\nThe problem states that mutations occur as independent events over sites according to a Poisson process. We will first consider a single site, site $i$, where $i$ is an integer from $1$ to $L$.\n\nThe rate of substitution at this single site is $\\mu$. For a Poisson process, the rate parameter $\\lambda$ for a given interval is the product of the rate and the length of the interval. In this case, the interval is the total evolutionary time $T = 2\\Delta t$. Thus, the rate parameter for the number of substitutions at a single site $i$ is $\\lambda_{\\text{site}} = \\mu \\times T = 2\\mu\\Delta t$.\n\nLet $K_i$ be the random variable representing the number of substitutions that occur at site $i$ over the total evolutionary time $T$. According to the problem definition, $K_i$ follows a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda_{\\text{site}}$.\n$$ K_i \\sim \\text{Poisson}(2\\mu\\Delta t) $$\nThe expected value of a Poisson-distributed random variable is equal to its rate parameter. Therefore, the expected number of substitutions at site $i$ is:\n$$ E[K_i] = 2\\mu\\Delta t $$\nNow, we consider the entire genome of length $L$. Let $K_{\\text{total}}$ be the total number of substitutions across all $L$ sites. Since mutations at different sites are assumed to be independent events, $K_{\\text{total}}$ is the sum of the substitutions at each site:\n$$ K_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} K_i $$\nThe problem requires us to use the linearity of expectation. Applying this principle, the expected total number of substitutions is the sum of the individual expectations:\n$$ E[K_{\\text{total}}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{L} K_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} E[K_i] $$\nSince the substitution rate $\\mu$ is assumed to be uniform across all $L$ sites, the expectation $E[K_i]$ is the same for every site $i$.\n$$ E[K_{\\text{total}}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} (2\\mu\\Delta t) = L(2\\mu\\Delta t) = 2\\mu L\\Delta t $$\nThe question asks for the expected number of SNP differences, which we denote as $E[N_{\\text{SNP}}]$. A SNP difference at a site corresponds to one or more substitution events having occurred at that site. The total number of substitutions, $K_{\\text{total}}$, is not strictly identical to the number of SNP differences, $N_{\\text{SNP}}$, because multiple substitutions can occur at the same site (an event known as a \"multiple hit\"). If a site experiences two or more substitutions, it still counts as only one SNP difference.\n\nHowever, in the context of short-term outbreaks in genomic epidemiology, the total evolutionary time $T = 2\\Delta t$ is typically very short, and the mutation rate $\\mu$ is low. Consequently, the rate parameter for a single site, $2\\mu\\Delta t$, is much less than $1$. For a Poisson process with a very small rate parameter $\\lambda$, the probability of observing two or more events, $P(k \\ge 2)$, is negligible compared to the probability of observing one event, $P(k=1)$.\n$P(k=0) = \\exp(-\\lambda) \\approx 1 - \\lambda$\n$P(k=1) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda) \\approx \\lambda$\n$P(k=2) = \\frac{\\lambda^2}{2} \\exp(-\\lambda) \\approx \\frac{\\lambda^2}{2}$\nSince $\\lambda \\ll 1$, we have $\\lambda^2 \\ll \\lambda$. Therefore, the probability of multiple hits at a single site is negligible.\n\nUnder this valid approximation, the number of sites with at least one substitution ($N_{\\text{SNP}}$) is approximately equal to the total number of substitutions ($K_{\\text{total}}$). Thus, their expectations are also approximately equal:\n$$ E[N_{\\text{SNP}}] \\approx E[K_{\\text{total}}] $$\nSo, the derived expression for the expected number of SNP differences is:\n$$ E[N_{\\text{SNP}}] = 2\\mu L\\Delta t $$\nThe minimal modeling assumptions that make this expression a valid approximation are:\n1.  **Strict Molecular Clock**: The substitution rate $\\mu$ is constant over time and across all lineages.\n2.  **Uniform Rate Across Sites**: The substitution rate $\\mu$ is the same for all $L$ genomic sites.\n3.  **Independence of Sites**: Substitutions at different sites are independent events.\n4.  **Poisson Process**: The occurrence of substitutions over time follows a Poisson distribution.\n5.  **Clonal Evolution**: The genomes evolve without recombination.\n6.  **Rare Mutations Approximation**: The probability of multiple substitutions occurring at the same site over the time period is negligible ($2\\mu\\Delta t \\ll 1$), which allows the expected number of SNPs to be approximated by the expected number of substitutions.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n- $\\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ substitutions per site per year\n- $L = 4.0 \\times 10^{6}$ sites\n- $\\Delta t = 0.25$ years\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived expression:\n$$ E[N_{\\text{SNP}}] = 2 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (4.0 \\times 10^{6}) \\times (0.25) $$\n$$ E[N_{\\text{SNP}}] = 2 \\times 1.0 \\times 4.0 \\times 0.25 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 10^{6} $$\n$$ E[N_{\\text{SNP}}] = (2 \\times 0.25) \\times 4.0 $$\n$$ E[N_{\\text{SNP}}] = 0.5 \\times 4.0 $$\n$$ E[N_{\\text{SNP}}] = 2.0 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
