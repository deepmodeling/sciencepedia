The problem is a formalizable exercise in applying a standard statistical measure to graph-theoretic properties and interpreting the results in a relevant context. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### (a) Degree Distributions\n\nThe degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. The degree distribution is the multiset of degrees of all $n$ nodes in the graph.\n\n1.  **Star Graph ($S_n$)**: A star graph on $n$ nodes consists of one central node connected to $n-1$ peripheral (leaf) nodes. The leaf nodes are not connected to each other.\n    - The central node is connected to all $n-1$ other nodes, so its degree is $n-1$.\n    - Each of the $n-1$ leaf nodes is connected only to the central node, so their degree is $1$.\n    - The degree distribution for $S_n$ is the multiset $\\{n-1, \\underbrace{1, 1, \\dots, 1}_{n-1 \\text{ times}}\\}$.\n\n2.  **Path Graph ($P_n$)**: A path graph on $n$ nodes consists of nodes $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n$ with edges connecting $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$ for $i = 1, \\dots, n-1$.\n    - The two endpoint nodes, $v_1$ and $v_n$, are each connected to only one other node, so their degree is $1$. This holds for $n \\geq 2$.\n    - The $n-2$ interior nodes, $v_2, \\dots, v_{n-1}$, are each connected to two neighbors. Their degree is $2$. This is applicable for $n \\geq 3$. If $n=2$, there are no interior nodes.\n    - The degree distribution for $P_n$ is the multiset $\\{\\underbrace{2, 2, \\dots, 2}_{n-2 \\text{ times}}, 1, 1\\}$.\n\n3.  **Complete Graph ($K_n$)**: A complete graph on $n$ nodes has an edge between every pair of distinct nodes.\n    - Each of the $n$ nodes is connected to every other of the $n-1$ nodes.\n    - Therefore, every node in $K_n$ has a degree of $n-1$.\n    - The degree distribution for $K_n$ is the multiset $\\{\\underbrace{n-1, n-1, \\dots, n-1}_{n \\text{ times}}\\}$.\n\n### (b) Gini Coefficients for Degree Inequality\n\nThe population Gini coefficient for a set of $n$ values $\\{k_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ (here, the degrees) is given by:\n$$G = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{n} |k_{i}-k_{j}|}{2n \\sum_{i=1}^{n} k_{i}}$$\nThe sum of degrees $\\sum_{i=1}^n k_i$ is equal to $2m$, where $m$ is the number of edges in the graph.\n\n**1. Gini Coefficient for the Star Graph ($G_{S_n}$)**\n-   The degree distribution is $\\{k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_n\\} = \\{n-1, 1, \\dots, 1\\}$.\n-   The sum of degrees is $\\sum k_i = (n-1) + (n-1) \\times 1 = 2(n-1)$.\n-   The denominator of the Gini formula is $2n \\sum k_i = 2n \\times 2(n-1) = 4n(n-1)$.\n-   The numerator is the sum of all absolute differences, $\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{n} |k_{i}-k_{j}|$. The only non-zero differences occur between the central node (degree $n-1$) and a leaf node (degree $1$). The absolute difference is $|(n-1)-1| = n-2$.\n    - There are $n-1$ pairs of (central node, leaf node).\n    - There are $n-1$ pairs of (leaf node, central node).\n    - All other pairs of nodes have a degree difference of $0$ (e.g., $|1-1|=0$ or $|(n-1)-(n-1)|=0$).\n-   The total sum of absolute differences is $(n-1) \\times (n-2) + (n-1) \\times (n-2) = 2(n-1)(n-2)$.\n-   The Gini coefficient is:\n$$G_{S_n} = \\frac{2(n-1)(n-2)}{4n(n-1)} = \\frac{n-2}{2n}$$\n\n**2. Gini Coefficient for the Path Graph ($G_{P_n}$)**\n-   The degree distribution is $\\{1, 1, 2, \\dots, 2\\}$, with two nodes of degree $1$ and $n-2$ nodes of degree $2$.\n-   The sum of degrees is $\\sum k_i = 2 \\times 1 + (n-2) \\times 2 = 2 + 2n - 4 = 2n-2 = 2(n-1)$.\n-   The denominator is $2n \\sum k_i = 2n \\times 2(n-1) = 4n(n-1)$.\n-   The numerator involves differences between nodes of degree $1$ and degree $2$. The absolute difference is $|2-1|=1$.\n    - There are $2$ nodes of degree $1$ and $n-2$ nodes of degree $2$.\n    - The number of ordered pairs (degree $1$, degree $2$) is $2 \\times (n-2)$.\n    - The number of ordered pairs (degree $2$, degree $1$) is $(n-2) \\times 2$.\n    - All other pairs have a degree difference of $0$.\n-   The total sum of absolute differences is $2(n-2) \\times 1 + 2(n-2) \\times 1 = 4(n-2)$.\n-   The Gini coefficient is:\n$$G_{P_n} = \\frac{4(n-2)}{4n(n-1)} = \\frac{n-2}{n(n-1)}$$\n\n**3. Gini Coefficient for the Complete Graph ($G_{K_n}$)**\n-   The degree distribution is $\\{n-1, n-1, \\dots, n-1\\}$. All $n$ nodes have the same degree.\n-   Since all degrees $k_i$ are identical, the difference $|k_i - k_j| = 0$ for all pairs $(i,j)$.\n-   The numerator of the Gini formula is $\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{n} |k_{i}-k_{j}| = 0$.\n-   Therefore, the Gini coefficient is:\n$$G_{K_n} = 0$$\n\n### (c) Discussion on Intervention Strategies\n\nThe Gini coefficient of the degree distribution quantifies the heterogeneity of contacts. Under the assumption that an individual's role in disease transmission is proportional to their degree, this heterogeneity has profound implications for the efficiency of public health interventions.\n\n-   **Star Graph ($S_n$)**: The Gini coefficient $G_{S_n} = \\frac{n-2}{2n} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{n}$. For large $n$, $G_{S_n} \\to \\frac{1}{2}$, indicating very high degree heterogeneity. The network is dominated by a single, high-degree hub. A **targeted strategy** that immunizes this single central node is maximally efficient, as it fragments the network into $n-1$ isolated nodes and halts transmission entirely. In contrast, a **uniform random strategy** has only a $\\frac{1}{n}$ chance of selecting the crucial hub. It will most likely immunize a leaf node (with probability $\\frac{n-1}{n}$), which has a negligible effect on the network's overall transmission capacity. Thus, in highly heterogeneous networks, the targeted approach is vastly superior.\n\n-   **Complete Graph ($K_n$)**: The Gini coefficient $G_{K_n} = 0$, indicating perfect homogeneity. Every node has the same degree ($n-1$) and is structurally equivalent. A strategy that **targets the highest-degree nodes** is ill-defined, as all nodes are \"highest-degree\". Functionally, a targeted strategy is identical to a **uniform random strategy**. There is no structural advantage to be gained by selecting one node over another based on degree. In such a dense, uniform mixing environment, interventions must cover a substantial fraction of the population to be effective, as there are no critical \"super-spreader\" nodes to prioritize.\n\n-   **Path Graph ($P_n$)**: The Gini coefficient $G_{P_n} = \\frac{n-2}{n(n-1)}$. For large $n$, $G_{P_n} \\to 0$, indicating low and diminishing heterogeneity. The degree distribution is nearly uniform, with most nodes having degree $2$ and only two endpoints having degree $1$. A **targeted strategy** would prioritize the $n-2$ nodes of degree $2$. Immunizing one of these nodes breaks the path, which is more effective at stopping spread than immunizing an endpoint. However, the degree difference is minimal ($2$ versus $1$). A **uniform random strategy** has a high probability, $\\frac{n-2}{n}$, of selecting a degree-$2$ node anyway. Therefore, while the targeted strategy is marginally better, the low degree heterogeneity means its advantage over a random strategy is slight and diminishes as $n$ increases.\n\nIn summary, the degree Gini coefficient is a powerful indicator of the potential leverage afforded by network structure. High Gini coefficients, as seen in the star graph, signal the presence of hubs whose targeted removal or immunization can efficiently collapse the network's transmission pathways. Low or zero Gini coefficients, as in the path and complete graphs, suggest that such targeted strategies offer little to no benefit over uniform random interventions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{n-2}{2n} & \\frac{n-2}{n(n-1)} & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4576720"}, {"introduction": "Beyond understanding a network's overall structure, identifying the most influential individuals within it is critical for targeted public health campaigns, like those aimed at countering vaccine hesitancy.

They consider two networks:\n\n1. A star network with $N = 101$ individuals, where one central individual is connected to all $100$ others (who have no other connections).\n2. An infinite one-dimensional regular lattice (the integer line), where each individual has exactly $2$ neighbors.\n\nIn both networks, a single initial infection is seeded. On the star, the initial infectious individual is selected uniformly at random from the $N$ nodes.

Let $X_R$ be the number of infected nodes to the right of the origin (i.e., in $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$) and $X_L$ be the number of infected nodes to the left. The total outbreak size is $S_{\\text{line}} = 1 + X_L + X_R$. By linearity of expectation, the expected size is $E[S_{\\text{line}}] = 1 + E[X_L] + E[X_R]$.\n\nDue to symmetry, $E[X_L] = E[X_R]$.

Each of the $N-1$ edges from $C$ to a peripheral node is open with probability $T$. The number of infected peripheral nodes, let's call it $Y$, follows a binomial distribution $Y \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n=N-1, p=T)$.\nThe expected number of infected peripherals is $E[Y] = (N-1)T$.\nThe expected outbreak size, given the center is the index case, is:\n$E[S_{\\text{star}}|\\text{center is index}] = 1 + E[Y] = 1 + (N-1)T$.\n\nCase B: A peripheral node $P_i$ is the index case.\nThe probability of this event is $p_P = (N-1)/N = 100/101$.\nThe outbreak size is at least $1$ (the node $P_i$ itself). $P_i$ is only connected to the central node $C$.\n- With probability $1-T$, the edge $(P_i, C)$ is not open.

Compute the Ratio R**\n\nThe ratio $R$ is defined as the expected size on the star network divided by the expected size on the 1D lattice.\n$$\nR = \\frac{E[S_{\\text{star}}]}{E[S_{\\text{line}}]} = \\frac{47349/4949}{9/5} = \\frac{47349}{4949} \\times \\frac{5}{9}\n$$\nThe sum of the digits of $47349$ is $4+7+3+4+9=27$, which is divisible by $9$. So, $47349/9 = 5261$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{5261 \\times 5}{4949} = \\frac{26305}{4949} \\approx 5.315215195...\n$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures gives $5.315$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.315}$$", "id": "4576722"}]}
