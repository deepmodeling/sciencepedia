This practice challenges you to construct a composite walkability index from several key environmental features. By combining standardized data on intersection density, land-use mix, and residential density, you will learn how researchers translate complex urban characteristics into a single, powerful metric for health assessment and city planning [@problem_id:4581710].", "problem": "A city planning team is evaluating neighborhood walkability as part of preventive medicine efforts to increase physical activity and reduce noncommunicable disease risk. In this city, three built environment features are standardized as citywide $z$-scores with city mean $0$ and city standard deviation $1$: intersection density ($z_1$), land-use mix ($z_2$), and residential density ($z_3$). For a particular census tract, the measured standardized values are $z_1=0.8$, $z_2=0.6$, and $z_3=1.2$. The team constructs a composite walkability index by aggregating these standardized components using equal normalized weights across the three components, reflecting that each feature contributes equally to walkability on a standardized scale.\n\nStarting from the definition of a standardized variable and a linear composite index built from standardized components, derive the composite walkability value for this tract under equal normalized weighting. Then, interpret the magnitude relative to the city distribution (mean $0$, standard deviation $1$) in terms of planning relevance for preventive medicine. Report only the composite walkability value, expressed as a unitless $z$-score, and round your numerical answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a composite walkability index for a specific census tract. The index is to be constructed as a linear combination of three standardized variables, each representing a feature of the built environment.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the definition of the composite index. A linear composite index, which we will denote as $Z_{\\text{walk}}$, is a weighted sum of its component variables. The variables provided are the standardized z-scores for intersection density ($z_1$), land-use mix ($z_2$), and residential density ($z_3$). The general form of the index is:\n$$Z_{\\text{walk}} = w_1 z_1 + w_2 z_2 + w_3 z_3 = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i z_i$$\nwhere $w_i$ are the weights assigned to each component $z_i$.\n\nThe problem states that the aggregation uses \"equal normalized weights\". This implies two conditions on the weights:\n1.  **Equal weights**: $w_1 = w_2 = w_3 = w$.\n2.  **Normalized weights**: The sum of the weights must equal $1$.\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i = 1$$\n\nCombining these two conditions, we can solve for the value of the weight $w$:\n$$w_1 + w_2 + w_3 = w + w + w = 3w = 1$$\nThis gives the specific value for each weight:\n$$w = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nSo, $w_1 = w_2 = w_3 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nNow we can write the specific formula for the composite walkability index:\n$$Z_{\\text{walk}} = \\frac{1}{3}z_1 + \\frac{1}{3}z_2 + \\frac{1}{3}z_3 = \\frac{1}{3}(z_1 + z_2 + z_3)$$\n\nThe problem provides the measured standardized values for the particular census tract:\n-   $z_1 = 0.8$\n-   $z_2 = 0.6$\n-   $z_3 = 1.2$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for $Z_{\\text{walk}}$:\n$$Z_{\\text{walk}} = \\frac{1}{3}(0.8 + 0.6 + 1.2)$$\n\nFirst, we sum the values inside the parentheses:\n$$0.8 + 0.6 + 1.2 = 2.6$$\n\nThen, we complete the calculation:\n$$Z_{\\text{walk}} = \\frac{1}{3}(2.6) = \\frac{2.6}{3}$$\n\nTo obtain the numerical value, we perform the division:\n$$Z_{\\text{walk}} \\approx 0.866666...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $8$, $6$, $6$, $6$. The fifth digit is $6$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$Z_{\\text{walk}} \\approx 0.8667$$\n\nThe problem also asks for an interpretation of this value. The component variables $z_i$ are standardized with a citywide mean of $0$ and standard deviation of $1$. The resulting composite index $Z_{\\text{walk}}$ is therefore expressed on a similar scale. The calculated value of $Z_{\\text{walk}} \\approx 0.8667$ is a positive z-score, which signifies that the walkability of this census tract is greater than the average walkability for the entire city. Specifically, the tract's walkability score is approximately $0.8667$ standard deviations above the city mean. From a preventive medicine standpoint, a higher walkability score is associated with an environment that promotes physical activity, which in turn can contribute to better health outcomes and a lower risk of noncommunicable diseases.
