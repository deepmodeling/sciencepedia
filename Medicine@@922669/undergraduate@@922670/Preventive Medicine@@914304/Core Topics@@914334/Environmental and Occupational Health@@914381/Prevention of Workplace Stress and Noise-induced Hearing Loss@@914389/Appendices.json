Mastering this calculation is a fundamental skill for any occupational health professional.

Use the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) noise standard assumptions of a $5\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ exchange rate and a $90\\,\\mathrm{dBA}$ criterion level for an $8\\,\\mathrm{h}$ workday.

The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe task is to compute the daily noise dose and the $8$-hour time-weighted average (TWA) for a production operator exposed to two different noise levels over an $8$-hour workday. Based on these calculations, an interpretation of compliance with the OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) is required.\n\nThe calculation proceeds in three steps: 1) determination of the noise dose, 2) calculation of the TWA, and 3) interpretation of the results.\n\n**1. Calculation of the OSHA Noise Dose ($D$)**\n\nThe total noise dose, $D$, is the sum of the partial doses for each distinct noise exposure segment. The partial dose for a segment is the ratio of the actual exposure time, $C$, to the permissible exposure time, $T$, at that specific noise level.\n$$D = \\sum_i \\frac{C_i}{T_i}$$\n\nThe OSHA standard specifies a criterion level of $90\\,\\mathrm{dBA}$ for an $8$-hour permissible exposure time, with a $5\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ exchange rate. This relationship is quantified by the formula for the permissible exposure time $T$ (in hours) at a given sound level $L$ (in dBA):\n$$T = \\frac{8}{2^{(L - 90)/5}}$$\n\nThe operator's workday is divided into two exposure segments.\n\n**Segment 1:**\n- Noise Level, $L_1 = 95\\,\\mathrm{dBA}$\n- Actual Exposure Duration, $C_1 = 4$ hours\n\nThe permissible exposure time at $95\\,\\mathrm{dBA}$ is:\n$$T_1 = \\frac{8}{2^{(95 - 90)/5}} = \\frac{8}{2^{5/5}} = \\frac{8}{2^1} = 4 \\text{ hours}$$\n\nThe partial dose for this segment is:\n$$D_1 = \\frac{C_1}{T_1} = \\frac{4 \\text{ h}}{4 \\text{ h}} = 1.0$$\n\n**Segment 2:**\n- Noise Level, $L_2 = 90\\,\\mathrm{dBA}$\n- Actual Exposure Duration, $C_2 = 4$ hours\n\nThe permissible exposure time at $90\\,\\mathrm{dBA}$, which is the criterion level, is by definition $8$ hours. This is confirmed by the formula:\n$$T_2 = \\frac{8}{2^{(90 - 90)/5}} = \\frac{8}{2^{0/5}} = \\frac{8}{2^0} = \\frac{8}{1} = 8 \\text{ hours}$$\n\nThe partial dose for this segment is:\n$$D_2 = \\frac{C_2}{T_2} = \\frac{4 \\text{ h}}{8 \\text{ h}} = 0.5$$\n\nThe total daily noise dose is the sum of the partial doses:\n$$D = D_1 + D_2 = 1.0 + 0.5 = 1.5$$\nThe OSHA dose, expressed as a decimal fraction, is $1.5$.\n\n**2. Calculation of the $8$-hour Time-Weighted Average (TWA)**\n\nThe TWA is the constant sound level over an $8$-hour period that would result in the same noise dose, $D$. The formula to calculate the TWA from the dose is derived by rearranging the dose formula. For a dose $D$ (as a decimal fraction), the TWA is:\n$$\\text{TWA} = 90 + 5 \\log_2(D)$$\nThis is equivalent to the commonly used formula involving the base-$10$ logarithm:\n$$\\text{TWA} = 90 + 5 \\frac{\\log_{10}(D)}{\\log_{10}(2)} \\approx 90 + 16.61 \\log_{10}(D)$$\n\nUsing the calculated dose $D = 1.5$:\n$$\\text{TWA} = 90 + 5 \\log_2(1.5)$$\nTo compute the value:\n$$\\text{TWA} = 90 + 5 \\frac{\\ln(1.5)}{\\ln(2)}$$\nUsing the values $\\ln(1.5) \\approx 0.405465$ and $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$:\n$$\\text{TWA} \\approx 90 + 5 \\left(\\frac{0.405465}{0.693147}\\right)$$\n$$\\text{TWA} \\approx 90 + 5(0.5849625...)$$\n$$\\text{TWA} \\approx 90 + 2.9248125...$$\n$$\\text{TWA} \\approx 92.9248125\\,\\mathrm{dBA}$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the TWA to four significant figures.\n$$\\text{TWA} = 92.92\\,\\mathrm{dBA}$$\n\n**3. Interpretation of Compliance**\n\nThe OSHA standard specifies a Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) which is met when the daily noise dose is less than or equal to $100\\%$, corresponding to a decimal fraction of $1.0$. The PEL also corresponds to an $8$-hour TWA of $90\\,\\mathrm{dBA}$.\n- The calculated dose is $D = 1.5$, which is greater than the limit of $1.0$.\n- The calculated $8$-hour TWA is $92.92\\,\\mathrm{dBA}$, which is greater than the limit of $90\\,\\mathrm{dBA}$.\n\nBoth metrics unequivocally demonstrate that the operator's daily noise exposure exceeds the OSHA PEL. Therefore, the exposure is non-compliant, and administrative or engineering controls are required to reduce the exposure.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.5 & 92.92\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4561458"}, {"introduction": "Once excessive noise exposure is identified, hearing protection devices (HPDs) are a common intervention, but their labeled ratings can be misleading. This practice demonstrates the crucial step of \"derating\" a manufacturer's Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) to estimate the actual protection a worker is likely to receive in the field. This ensures the chosen HPD is truly adequate for the hazard, bridging the gap between laboratory promises and real-world performance. [@problem_id:4561424]", "problem": "A metal fabrication shop has measured an eight-hour equivalent A-weighted noise exposure of $L_{A,\\mathrm{eq},8\\mathrm{h}} = 98\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ at a particular workstation. The safety officer plans to implement disposable foam earplugs labeled with a EPA Noise Reduction Rating (NRR). The goal is to reduce the worker’s protected A-weighted exposure to at most $85\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ during the shift.\n\nStarting only from the following foundational elements:\n- The definition of sound pressure level in decibels, $L = 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{rms}}^{2}}{p_{\\mathrm{ref}}^{2}}\\right)$, and the property that subtraction of decibel levels corresponds to division of mean-square pressures.\n- The fact that EPA-labeled NRR values are determined under laboratory conditions and referenced to broadband noise with C-weighting, whereas typical occupational exposure assessments use A-weighted levels, which commonly differ from C-weighted levels for broadband industrial noise.\n- The well-established and widely used conservative practice that real-world field performance of earplugs is substantially lower than the laboratory rating due to fit variability, user error, and physiological transmission pathways.\n\nDo the following:\n1. Derive, from these bases, a conservative analytical expression for the effective A-weighted attenuation applied in the field to an A-weighted exposure when only the EPA NRR is available. Your derivation should explicitly justify any fixed numerical adjustments between A- and C-weighting and any multiplicative safety factor representing field derating, grounded in the above elements.\n2. Use your derived expression to determine the minimum labeled NRR (in dB) that would be sufficient to bring the protected A-weighted exposure from $98\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ down to at most $85\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ at this workstation.\n\nExpress the final answer as a single real number in $\\mathrm{dB}$, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "We begin from the definition of sound pressure level in decibels. For a root-mean-square pressure $p_{\\mathrm{rms}}$ relative to reference $p_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, the level is\n$$\nL = 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{rms}}^{2}}{p_{\\mathrm{ref}}^{2}}\\right) = 20 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{rms}}}{p_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right).\n$$\nIf a hearing protector reduces the mean-square pressure at the eardrum by a factor corresponding to an attenuation of $A$ decibels, then subtracting $A$ from an exposure level $L$ corresponds to dividing the mean-square pressure by a factor of $10^{A/10}$. Thus, the protected level is $L_{\\mathrm{prot}} = L_{\\mathrm{unprot}} - A$, as a decibel arithmetic statement.\n\nEPA-labeled Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) values are determined in laboratories under controlled conditions across broad frequency content and are referenced to measurements consistent with C-weighting. In occupational hygiene practice, exposure assessment often uses A-weighted levels, denoted $L_{A}$, which de-emphasize low-frequency content relative to C-weighted levels, $L_{C}$. For typical broadband industrial noise spectra, a well-tested empirical relationship is that $L_{C}$ tends to exceed $L_{A}$ by approximately $7\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ when averaged across representative spectra. This motivates an adjustment between the C-referenced attenuation measure and the A-weighted exposure: to estimate an A-weighted attenuation from an NRR referenced to C-weighting, we subtract $7\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ from the laboratory NRR. Symbolically, if the labeled NRR is $N$, the corresponding A-weighted attenuation proxy from laboratory data is $N - 7$.\n\nHowever, the laboratory-derived attenuation does not reflect field performance. Real-world attenuation is reduced by:\n- Fit variability across users and over time,\n- Insertion errors and compatibility with individual ear canal anatomies,\n- Movement, jaw motion, and partial seal loss,\n- Non-occluded transmission pathways such as bone conduction.\n\nExtensive occupational field studies and guidance documents report that, for earplugs, the central tendency of field attenuation is substantially below the labeled NRR. A conservative, widely adopted practice applies an approximate factor-of-two reduction to the laboratory-based A-weighted attenuation to account for these degradations, yielding a safety factor that aims to cover inter-individual variability and day-to-day differences. Representing this as a multiplicative factor of $\\tfrac{1}{2}$, the effective field attenuation applied to an A-weighted exposure can be expressed as\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{N - 7}{2}.\n$$\nThis expression encodes two adjustments grounded in the above bases: the fixed $7\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ offset to convert from a C-weighted laboratory rating to an A-weighted context for typical broadband noise, and a factor-of-two derating to conservatively represent field performance of earplugs.\n\nTo achieve a protected A-weighted exposure at or below the target $85\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ from an unprotected $L_{A,\\mathrm{unprot}} = 98\\,\\mathrm{dB}$, the required attenuation is\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{req}} = L_{A,\\mathrm{unprot}} - L_{A,\\mathrm{target}} = 98 - 85 = 13\\,\\mathrm{dB}.\n$$\nWe set the effective field attenuation at least as large as this requirement:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\geq 13.\n$$\nUsing the derived conservative relation $A_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{N - 7}{2}$, the condition becomes\n$$\n\\frac{N - 7}{2} \\geq 13 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad N - 7 \\geq 26 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad N \\geq 33.\n$$\nTherefore, the minimum labeled NRR sufficient to achieve the $85\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ target under this conservative field-adjusted approach is $N = 33\\,\\mathrm{dB}$. Rounded to three significant figures, this is $33.0\\,\\mathrm{dB}$.\n\nRationale for derating: The subtraction of $7\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ reflects the empirically observed difference between C-weighted and A-weighted levels for typical broadband industrial noise, aligning the C-referenced laboratory rating with A-weighted occupational assessments. The division by $2$ implements a conservative safety factor based on well-documented discrepancies between laboratory fit and real-world use, capturing decreased insertion loss due to user variability, imperfect fit, and alternative transmission paths, thereby preventing overestimation of protection and reducing the risk of noise-induced hearing loss in the field.\n\nThus, the conservative minimum labeled NRR required is $33.0\\,\\mathrm{dB}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{33.0}$$", "id": "4561424"}, {"introduction": "A comprehensive prevention program must include monitoring workers' hearing over time to verify that controls are effective and to catch early signs of damage.

The solution proceeds by first calculating the threshold shifts at the specified frequencies, then their arithmetic mean, and finally comparing these results against the established OSHA criteria for an STS and for recordability of work-related hearing loss.\n\nFirst, we establish the necessary definitions. A hearing threshold, measured in decibels Hearing Level (dB HL), is the softest sound intensity level at which a person can detect a pure-tone signal at a specific frequency. A threshold shift is the change in a hearing threshold measured between two points in time.\n\nThe problem provides the following data:\nThe set of test frequencies is $F = \\{2\\,\\text{kHz}, 3\\,\\text{kHz}, 4\\,\\text{kHz}\\}$.\nThe baseline (reference) thresholds, denoted as $T_B(f)$, for an ear at these frequencies are:\n$T_B(2\\,\\text{kHz}) = 10\\,\\text{dB HL}$\n$T_B(3\\,\\text{kHz}) = 15\\,\\text{dB HL}$\n$T_B(4\\,\\text{kHz}) = 20\\,\\text{dB HL}$\n\nThe follow-up thresholds, denoted as $T_F(f)$, measured after noise exposure are:\n$T_F(2\\,\\text{kHz}) = 20\\,\\text{dB HL}$\n$T_F(3\\,\\text{kHz}) = 25\\,\\text{dB HL}$\n$T_F(4\\,\\text{kHz}) = 30\\,\\text{dB HL}$\n\nThe threshold shift at each frequency, $\\Delta T(f)$, is the difference between the follow-up threshold and the baseline threshold:\n$$ \\Delta T(f) = T_F(f) - T_B(f) $$\nWe calculate the shift for each frequency in the set $F$:\nFor $f = 2\\,\\text{kHz}$:\n$ \\Delta T(2\\,\\text{kHz}) = 20\\,\\text{dB HL} - 10\\,\\text{dB HL} = 10\\,\\text{dB} $\nFor $f = 3\\,\\text{kHz}$:\n$ \\Delta T(3\\,\\text{kHz}) = 25\\,\\text{dB HL} - 15\\,\\text{dB HL} = 10\\,\\text{dB} $\nFor $f = 4\\,\\text{kHz}$:\n$ \\Delta T(4\\,\\text{kHz}) = 30\\,\\text{dB HL} - 20\\,\\text{dB HL} = 10\\,\\text{dB} $\n\nNext, we compute the average threshold shift, $\\overline{\\Delta T}$, across these three frequencies.

Since $10\\,\\text{dB} \\ge 10\\,\\text{dB}$, the criterion is met. Therefore, a Standard Threshold Shift has occurred.\n\nFinally, we must determine if the case is recordable on the OSHA 300 Log. According to OSHA recordkeeping regulation 29 CFR 1904.10, a work-related hearing loss case is recordable if an employee has experienced an STS and the employee's total hearing level is $25\\,\\text{dB HL}$ or more above audiometric zero, on average, at the frequencies $2000\\,\\text{Hz}$, $3000\\,\\text{Hz}$, and $4000\\,\\text{Hz}$ in the same ear where the STS occurred. The problem context implies work-relatedness (\"after exposure to continuous industrial noise\").\n\nTo check the second part of the criterion, we must calculate the average of the current (follow-up) hearing thresholds, $\\overline{T_F}$:\n$$ \\overline{T_F} = \\frac{T_F(2\\,\\text{kHz}) + T_F(3\\,\\text{kHz}) + T_F(4\\,\\text{kHz})}{3} $$\nSubstituting the follow-up threshold values:\n$$ \\overline{T_F} = \\frac{20\\,\\text{dB HL} + 25\\,\\text{dB HL} + 30\\,\\text{dB HL}}{3} = \\frac{75\\,\\text{dB HL}}{3} = 25\\,\\text{dB HL} $$\nThe recordability criterion requires this average hearing level to be $25\\,\\text{dB HL}$ or greater:\n$$ \\overline{T_F} \\ge 25\\,\\text{dB HL} $$\nOur calculated average follow-up threshold is $\\overline{T_F} = 25\\,\\text{dB HL}$.
