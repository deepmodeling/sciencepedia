The World Health Organization (WHO) guideline for drinking water specifies absence of Escherichia coli in a $100$ milliliter sample and prescriptive performance targets for Log Removal Values (LRVs) of enteric viruses and protozoa, commonly taken as $4$-log for viruses and $3$-log for protozoa.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information to determine a unique solution. The definitions and data provided are consistent with established principles in environmental engineering and public health. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to calculate the required Log Removal Values (LRVs) for three classes of microorganisms: *Escherichia coli*, enteric viruses, and *Cryptosporidium spp.* protozoa. The Log Removal Value, denoted as $L$, is defined by the formula:\n$$L = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{C_{\\text{in}}}{C_{\\text{out}}}\\right)$$\nwhere $C_{\\text{in}}$ is the influent (source water) concentration and $C_{\\text{out}}$ is the effluent (treated water) concentration of the contaminant, measured in the same reference volume.\n\nWe will calculate the required LRV for each pathogen class based on the provided data and targets.\n\n1.  **Escherichia coli** ($L_{\\text{E.coli}}$)\n    The influent concentration is given as $C_{\\text{in, E.coli}} = 10^3$ colony-forming units (CFU) per $100$ milliliters. The target is \"absence\" in a $100$ milliliter sample. The problem explicitly operationalizes this for calculation by stating that the target effluent concentration should be treated as $C_{\\text{out, E.coli}} = 1$ CFU per $100$ milliliters. This is based on the goal of reducing the expected count to be strictly less than $1$, with $1$ being the boundary for calculation.\n\n    Using the LRV definition, we can calculate the minimum required LRV for *E. coli*:\n    $$L_{\\text{E.coli}} = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{C_{\\text{in, E.coli}}}{C_{\\text{out, E.coli}}}\\right)$$\n    The concentrations are both given per a reference volume of $100$ milliliters, so the units are consistent and will cancel in the ratio.\n    $$L_{\\text{E.coli}} = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{10^3 \\text{ CFU} / 100 \\text{ mL}}{1 \\text{ CFU} / 100 \\text{ mL}}\\right)$$\n    $$L_{\\text{E.coli}} = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{10^3}{1}\\right) = \\log_{10}(10^3)$$\n    Using the property of logarithms $\\log_b(b^x) = x$, we find:\n    $$L_{\\text{E.coli}} = 3$$\n    Therefore, a $3$-log removal is required for *E. coli*.\n\n2.  **Enteric Viruses** ($L_{\\text{viruses}}$)\n    The problem specifies the target for enteric viruses differently. It states a prescriptive performance target: \"a $4$-log for viruses\". It further clarifies that this target must be satisfied \"irrespective of influent levels.\" This means the required minimum LRV is given directly as part of the problem's constraints.\n    The influent virus concentration is given as $10$ plaque-forming units (PFU) per $100$ milliliters, but this information is not needed to determine the required LRV, since the target is a prescriptive log removal value itself.\n    The required LRV is the specified target:\n    $$L_{\\text{viruses}} = 4$$\n    Therefore, a $4$-log removal is required for enteric viruses.\n\n3.  **Cryptosporidium spp. (Protozoa)** ($L_{\\text{protozoa}}$)\n    Similar to the case for viruses, the target for protozoa is a prescriptive performance target: \"a $3$-log for protozoa... irrespective of influent levels.\" The influent concentration of $1$ oocyst per $100$ liters is provided but is not necessary for determining the required LRV. The requirement is the target value itself.\n    The required LRV is the specified target:\n    $$L_{\\text{protozoa}} = 3$$\n    Therefore, a $3$-log removal is required for protozoa.\n\nCombining the results, the required minimum LRVs for each pathogen class, reported as the ordered triple $\\left(L_{\\text{E.coli}}, L_{\\text{viruses}}, L_{\\text{protozoa}}\\right)$, are $(3, 4, 3)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3  4  3 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4592849"}, {"introduction": "Safe water is rarely achieved with a single step; instead, we rely on a robust multi-barrier approach.

The concepts of turbidity, chlorine disinfection, the CT (concentration-time) concept for disinfection kinetics, and the multi-barrier approach are all standard and well-established. The numerical values provided (turbidity, chlorine residual, pH, temperature, contact time, and target CT) are realistic for a rural water supply scenario.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem consists of two parts: a qualitative justification and a quantitative calculation. The justification is based on provided, factually sound premises. The calculation is well-defined, with all necessary data supplied to calculate a unique solution for the margin factor $M$.\n-   **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. The data required for the calculation ($C$, $t$, $CT_{\\text{target}}$) are all provided, and there are no contradictions in the setup. The assumption of a stable free chlorine residual over the contact time is explicitly stated for the purpose of the calculation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information to proceed with a reasoned solution.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires a justification for a multi-barrier approach in water treatment, followed by a calculation to assess the disinfection performance of the described system.\n\n#### Justification for the Multi-Barrier Approach\nThe multi-barrier approach is a foundational principle of preventive medicine and public health engineering, ensuring the safety of drinking water by using multiple, redundant treatment steps. Each step, or \"barrier,\" is designed to remove or inactivate pathogens, such that the failure of a single barrier does not necessarily lead to the contamination of the final water supply. In this scenario, the proposed multi-barrier system combines filtration (a physical removal process) with chlorination (a chemical inactivation process). The justification for requiring filtration in addition to chlorination, especially when source water turbidity is non-trivial (e.g., the given $8$ NTU), is based on several critical factors:\n\n1.  **Physical Shielding of Pathogens:** Turbidity is a measure of water cloudiness caused by suspended particulate matter. This matter can include clay, silt, organic and inorganic substances, and microorganisms themselves. A key failure mode for a disinfection-only barrier is the ability of this particulate matter to physically shield or encase pathogens (such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoan cysts) from the disinfectant. While a free chlorine residual may be present in the bulk water, it cannot penetrate these particles to inactivate the shielded microbes. Consequently, even if the calculated CT value appears adequate, viable pathogens can pass through the system and into the distributed water, posing a significant health risk. Filtration physically removes the majority of this particulate matter, thereby eliminating the shielding effect and making subsequent disinfection far more effective and reliable.\n\n2.  **Disinfectant Demand:** The particles that cause turbidity, particularly natural organic matter (NOM), react with and consume free chlorine. This phenomenon is known as chlorine demand. In water with high turbidity, a significant and often variable fraction of the dosed chlorine is consumed in these side reactions, rather than being available for disinfection. This makes it difficult to maintain a stable and predictable free chlorine residual ($C$) throughout the contact chamber and the distribution system. To compensate, operators might increase the chlorine dose, which can lead to the formation of harmful disinfection by-products (DBPs) like trihalomethanes. By removing the turbidity-causing particles via filtration, the chlorine demand of the water is substantially reduced. This allows for a lower, more controlled chlorine dose to achieve and maintain the target residual, enhancing safety while minimizing DBP formation.\n\n3.  **Variability and Process Robustness:** Surface water sources are susceptible to rapid changes in quality, especially turbidity, due to events like rainfall and runoff. A sudden spike in turbidity can overwhelm a system that relies solely on disinfection. The increased particle load can exert a high chlorine demand, depleting the free chlorine residual, while simultaneously increasing the number of shielded pathogens. This can lead to an acute failure of the treatment process. Filtration acts as a robust buffer, consistently reducing turbidity to low levels (typically less than $0.3$ NTU in modern plants) before the water reaches the disinfection step. This ensures that the disinfection process operates under stable, optimized conditions, making the overall treatment system resilient to fluctuations in source water quality.\n\nIn summary, reliance on chlorination alone in the presence of $8$ NTU turbidity is a fragile strategy. The combination of particle shielding, high chlorine demand, and source water variability creates an unacceptable risk of treatment failure. A multi-barrier approach incorporating filtration is therefore essential from a preventive medicine standpoint to reliably produce safe drinking water.\n\n#### Disinfection Performance Calculation\nThe effectiveness of chemical disinfection is quantified using the concentration-time (CT) concept. The CT value is the product of the disinfectant concentration, $C$, and the effective contact time, $t$.\n\nThe achieved CT value, designated $CT_{\\text{achieved}}$, is calculated using the given parameters. The problem states to assume the measured free chlorine residual is maintained over the entire contact time.\n-   Disinfectant concentration, $C = 0.20 \\text{ mg/L}$.\n-   Contact time, $t = 30 \\text{ min}$.\n\nThe achieved CT is calculated as:\n$$CT_{\\text{achieved}} = C \\times t$$\n$$CT_{\\text{achieved}} = (0.20 \\text{ mg/L}) \\times (30 \\text{ min}) = 6.0 \\text{ mg}\\cdot\\text{min/L}$$\n\nThe problem provides the regulatory target CT value for achieving $2$-log inactivation of enteric viruses under the specified conditions ($\\text{pH}=7$, $20^{\\circ}\\text{C}$):\n$$CT_{\\text{target}} = 6 \\text{ mg}\\cdot\\text{min/L}$$\n\nThe margin factor, $M$, is the ratio of the achieved CT to the target CT:\n$$M = \\frac{CT_{\\text{achieved}}}{CT_{\\text{target}}}$$\n$$M = \\frac{6.0 \\text{ mg}\\cdot\\text{min/L}}{6 \\text{ mg}\\cdot\\text{min/L}} = 1$$\n\nThe calculated value of $M$ is exactly $1$. The problem requires the result to be reported to three significant figures.\n$$M = 1.00$$\n\nA margin factor of $M=1.00$ indicates that the system is, under the idealized assumptions of the calculation, exactly meeting the minimum regulatory requirement for $2$-log virus inactivation. It provides no margin of safety. This result critically reinforces the justification for a multi-barrier approach. Any minor deviation from the ideal conditions—such as a slight drop in chlorine residual, a decrease in contact time due to hydraulic short-circuiting, or the presence of shielded pathogens in the $8$ NTU water—would cause the system to fail to meet the required public health target ($M  1$). Therefore, the lack of a safety margin in the disinfection step further underscores the necessity of an upstream filtration barrier for ensuring public health protection.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.00}$$", "id": "4592958"}, {"introduction": "The \"H\" in WASH, hygiene, is fundamentally about human behavior, which can be notoriously difficult to measure accurately.
