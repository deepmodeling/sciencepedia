Definition: A Critical Control Point is any step at which a parameter is critical to product quality; a control point is a step affecting only safety. CCPs in this process are Step $1$ (receiving temperature) and Step $3$ (vacuum packaging), while Steps $4$, $5$, and $6$ are not CCPs because later cooking and service address the hazards.\n\nD. Definition: A Critical Control Point is a step at which control can be applied and is essential to prevent, eliminate, or reduce a significant food safety hazard to an acceptable level; a control point is any step that requires documentation. CCPs in this process are Step $4$ (sous vide cook) and Step $7$ (final sear) only; Steps $5$ and $6$ are not CCPs because refrigeration controls are general facility practices.\n\nE. Definition: A Critical Control Point is a step at which control can be applied and is essential to prevent, eliminate, or reduce a significant food safety hazard to an acceptable level; a control point is a step where control can be applied but is not essential for safety. CCPs in this process are Steps $1$ through $7$ (all steps), because any loss of control at any step could affect safety.", "solution": "Begin from core definitions. In the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) framework, a Critical Control Point (CCP) is defined as a step at which control can be applied and is essential to prevent, eliminate, or reduce a significant food safety hazard to an acceptable level. A control point (CP) is any step where control can be applied, but it is not essential for safety; such controls are often managed through prerequisite programs such as sanitation, supplier approval, equipment maintenance, and calibration. The Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) critical control point decision tree is then applied to each significant hazard at each step to determine whether the step is a CCP.\n\nApply the Codex decision tree stepwise, integrating the given microbiological lethality and growth facts.\n\nStep $4$ (Sous vide cook at $55\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ with $120$ minutes post come-up hold): \n- Target hazard(s): Salmonella spp. and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli on beef surfaces. The product is intact muscle; pre-cook vacuum packaging and immersion means the core reaches $55\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and is then held.\n- Control measure: Time-temperature lethality at $55\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. \n- Quantitative lethality: The validated decimal reduction time is $D_{55\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}} = 12$ minutes. Holding for $120$ minutes after the geometric center reaches $55\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ yields a log reduction of $$\\text{log reduction} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10 \\text{ logs},$$ which exceeds the stated performance objective of at least $6$ logs.\n- Decision tree: \n  $1)$ Control measures exist at this step (yes).\n  $2)$ The step is specifically designed to eliminate or reduce the likely occurrence of the hazard to an acceptable level (yes; time-temperature lethality achieves the $6$-log target).\n  Therefore, by Codex logic, Step $4$ is a CCP.\n\nStep $5$ (Rapid chilling to $\\leq 3\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ within $2$ hours): \n- Target hazard: Clostridium perfringens outgrowth during cooling through the danger range, and, more broadly, growth of other vegetative pathogens during slow cooling.\n- Control measure: Rapid cooling performance criterion. The provided target of $\\leq 3\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ within $2$ hours is more stringent than the commonly cited $54\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to $21\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ within $2$ hours and to $\\leq 5\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ within $6$ hours and will control C. perfringens outgrowth to acceptable limits (e.g., less than approximately $1$-log growth).\n- Decision tree:\n  $1)$ Control measures exist at this step (yes; rapid chilling).\n  $2)$ The step is specifically designed to reduce the likelihood of the hazard to an acceptable level (yes; prevention of growth to acceptable limits).\n  Therefore, Step $5$ is a CCP.\n\nStep $6$ (Refrigerated storage at $2\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ for up to $10$ days in vacuum): \n- Target hazard: Non-proteolytic Clostridium botulinum growth and toxin production under anaerobic conditions created by vacuum packaging. The minimum growth temperature is approximately $3.0\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$; growth and toxin formation are effectively controlled by strict storage at $\\leq 3.0\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and limiting shelf-life (e.g., $\\leq 10$ days), or by additional hurdles (e.g., salt, nitrite, pH).\n- Control measure: Temperature control (at $2\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$) and shelf-life limitation (up to $10$ days).\n- Decision tree:\n  $1)$ Control measures exist at this step (yes; cold storage and time limitation).\n  $2)$ Is the step specifically designed to eliminate or reduce the hazard to an acceptable level? Yes; it prevents growth and toxin production by maintaining conditions under the organism’s minimum growth temperature and limiting time under refrigeration.\n  $4)$ Will a subsequent step eliminate or reduce the hazard to an acceptable level? No; botulinum toxin, if present, would not be reliably inactivated by the subsequent brief sear (and in any case toxin would be unacceptable). Boiling at approximately $100\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ for about $10$ minutes is required for inactivation; this is not part of the process.\n  Therefore, Step $6$ is a CCP.\n\nStep $3$ (Vacuum packaging):\n- Target hazard context: This step creates anaerobic conditions that could enable non-proteolytic Clostridium botulinum growth during storage if not otherwise controlled. The step itself is not designed to eliminate or reduce a hazard; rather, it can increase the potential for a specific hazard if downstream controls fail.\n- Decision tree:\n  $1)$ Do control measures exist at this step for the identified hazard? No; the step creates the anaerobic condition, but the control of the hazard is not achieved here.\n  $3)$ Could the hazard occur or increase here? Yes; anaerobic conditions are established.\n  $4)$ Will a subsequent step eliminate or reduce the hazard to an acceptable level? Yes; Step $6$ (strict cold storage and time limit) specifically controls the hazard.\n  Because a subsequent step controls the hazard, Step $3$ is not a CCP. It may be managed as a control point (e.g., seal integrity for quality and to ensure the intended anaerobic state for process consistency), but safety is assured by the CCP at Step $6$.\n\nStep $7$ (Final sear at $230\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ for approximately $90$ seconds per side):\n- Target hazard: Potential post-process contamination (e.g., Listeria monocytogenes) during bag opening and transfer. The steaks are served immediately, not hot held.\n- Considerations: The validated lethality has already been delivered at Step $4$. The brief sear primarily develops surface browning and may provide some surface lethality, but given adherence to sanitation prerequisite programs and the immediate service, the hazard at this step is not reasonably likely to be significant. Moreover, this sear would not be relied upon to inactivate any botulinum toxin, should it form (which is prevented by Step $6$).\n- Decision tree:\n  $1)$ Do control measures exist? Yes, but\n  $2)$ Is the step specifically designed to eliminate or reduce a significant hazard to an acceptable level as the primary safety measure? No, given the process design and prerequisites, and\n  $4)$ Is there a need because no subsequent step will control it? No, because the significant hazards are already controlled at Steps $4$, $5$, and $6$.\n  Therefore, Step $7$ is not a CCP in this design.\n\nOther steps (Steps $1$ and $2$): Receiving controls (temperature on receipt, approved suppliers) and sanitation at trimming/seasoning are typically addressed via prerequisite programs. Although important, they are not CCPs here because subsequent validated lethality (Step $4$) eliminates vegetative pathogens introduced earlier.\n\nSynthesis: The CCPs identified by principled application of the Codex decision tree and the provided facts are Step $4$ (sous vide cook), Step $5$ (rapid chilling), and Step $6$ (refrigerated storage with strict temperature and time limits). Vacuum packaging and final sear are not CCPs in this plan; they are managed through control points and prerequisite programs.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\n- Option A: The definition correctly distinguishes a CCP (essential to prevent, eliminate, or reduce a significant hazard to an acceptable level) from a CP (control applied but not essential for safety, typically under prerequisite programs). The identified CCPs (Steps $4$, $5$, and $6$) match the decision tree analysis above. Packaging and final sear are rightly excluded as CCPs. Correct.\n\n- Option B: The definition is incorrect; CCPs are not defined by whether a parameter is measured, and CPs are not defined by an absence of measurement. The identified CCPs are also incorrect: vacuum packaging is not a CCP here because the hazard it enables is controlled at Step $6$, and the final sear is not relied upon as the primary safety step. Cooking and storage are incorrectly excluded. Incorrect.\n\n- Option C: The definition reverses safety and quality, stating CCPs are about quality rather than safety, which is incorrect. The identified CCPs (receiving and vacuum packaging) are inconsistent with the decision tree; cooking, chilling, and storage are wrongly excluded. Incorrect.\n\n- Option D: While the CCP portion of the definition is partially correct, the CP portion is mischaracterized as “any step that requires documentation,” which is not the accepted definition. The identified CCPs omit chilling and refrigerated storage, both of which are essential controls for C. perfringens and non-proteolytic C. botulinum, respectively, in this sous vide process. Incorrect.\n\n- Option E: The definition of CCP and CP is acceptable, but the identification of every step as a CCP is not aligned with the decision tree; designating all steps as CCPs dilutes control focus and is contrary to HACCP principles. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4526136"}, {"introduction": "Once a CCP is identified, we must establish its critical limits based on scientific evidence.

It uses established principles of food microbiology (D-value, log reduction) and statistical process control (normal distribution, coefficient of variation) in a consistent and well-defined manner. The values provided are realistic for a food processing context.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three steps: first, determining the minimum required hold time for the specified lethality; second, establishing a statistical model to account for process variability; and third, calculating the process setpoint that meets the required confidence level.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Minimum Required Hold Time ($t_{min}$)**\nFor first-order log-linear inactivation kinetics, the time required to achieve a certain log reduction is the product of the number of log reductions and the decimal reduction time (D-value). The D-value, $D_T$, is the time required at a constant temperature $T$ to reduce the viable population by $90\\%$, or $1$ logarithm.\nThe required log reduction is $N_{req} = 6$.\nThe D-value is given as $D_{72\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}} = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{min}$.\nThe minimum hold time, $t_{min}$, that achieves the target $6$-log reduction is therefore:\n$$t_{min} = N_{req} \\times D_{72\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}} = 6 \\times 0.5\\ \\mathrm{min} = 3.0\\ \\mathrm{min}$$\nThis value represents the critical limit; any product held for less than $3.0\\ \\mathrm{min}$ is considered underprocessed and does not meet the food safety requirement.\n\n**Step 2: Model Process Variability and Set the Safety Margin**\nThe actual hold time, $t$, is a normally distributed random variable, $t \\sim N(\\mu_t, \\sigma_t^2)$. The mean $\\mu_t$ is the scheduled hold-time setpoint we need to determine. The standard deviation $\\sigma_t$ is related to the mean via the coefficient of variation, $CV$:\n$$\\sigma_t = CV \\times \\mu_t = 0.05 \\mu_t$$\nThe food safety plan requires that at least $0.997$ of units meet or exceed the required lethality. This translates to the probabilistic statement:\n$$P(t \\geq t_{min}) \\geq 0.997$$\nTo ensure this high level of confidence, a safety margin must be incorporated into the process setpoint. In statistical process control, a common and robust approach is to use a $3$-sigma margin. The value $0.997$ is characteristic of the empirical rule for a normal distribution, which states that approximately $99.7\\%$ of data lies within $3$ standard deviations of the mean, i.e., $P(\\mu_t - 3\\sigma_t \\leq t \\leq \\mu_t + 3\\sigma_t) \\approx 0.997$.\nFor our one-sided requirement, setting the critical limit $t_{min}$ at $3$ standard deviations below the mean setpoint, $t_{min} = \\mu_t - 3\\sigma_t$, ensures that the probability of failure is very low. This choice of margin is justified because it satisfies the specified condition. If we let $Z$ be the standard normal variable $Z = (t-\\mu_t)/\\sigma_t$, the condition $t \\geq \\mu_t - 3\\sigma_t$ becomes $Z \\geq -3$. The corresponding probability is:\n$$P(Z \\geq -3) = 1 - \\Phi(-3)$$\nwhere $\\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. Using the value $\\Phi(-3) \\approx 0.00135$, we get:\n$$P(t \\geq t_{min}) \\approx 1 - 0.00135 = 0.99865$$\nSince $0.99865 > 0.997$, a $3$-sigma safety margin satisfies the requirement of achieving the target lethality in \"at least $0.997$\" of units.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Scheduled Hold-Time Setpoint ($\\mu_t$)**\nWe now have a system of equations:\n1. $t_{min} = 3.0\\ \\mathrm{min}$\n2. $t_{min} = \\mu_t - 3\\sigma_t$\n3. $\\sigma_t = 0.05\\mu_t$\n\nSubstitute equation (3) into equation (2):\n$$t_{min} = \\mu_t - 3(0.05\\mu_t) = \\mu_t(1 - 0.15) = 0.85\\mu_t$$\nNow, substitute the value of $t_{min}$ from equation (1):\n$$3.0 = 0.85\\mu_t$$\nSolving for the mean setpoint $\\mu_t$:\n$$\\mu_t = \\frac{3.0}{0.85} \\approx 3.529411... \\ \\mathrm{min}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\mu_t \\approx 3.529\\ \\mathrm{min}$$\nThis is the minimum scheduled hold time that ensures the $6$-log reduction is achieved for at least $99.7\\%$ of the product units, given the variability of the process.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.529}$$", "id": "4525998"}, {"introduction": "An effective HACCP system requires not just setting limits, but actively monitoring them to ensure the process remains in a state of control.
