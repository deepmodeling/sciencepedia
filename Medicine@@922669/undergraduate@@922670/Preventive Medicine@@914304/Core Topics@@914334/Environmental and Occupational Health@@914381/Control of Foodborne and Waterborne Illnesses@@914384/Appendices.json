Incidence (Attack Rate)**\nThe incidence rate in a cohort study, often called the attack rate in an outbreak context, measures the risk of disease in a given group over a specified period.\n\nThe incidence in the exposed group, $I_e$, is the proportion of exposed individuals who become ill.\n$$I_e = \\frac{a}{N_1} = \\frac{35}{70} = 0.5$$\n\nThe incidence in the unexposed group, $I_u$, is the proportion of unexposed individuals who become ill.\n$$I_u = \\frac{c}{N_0} = \\frac{15}{110} = \\frac{3}{22} \\approx 0.1364$$\n\n**2. Relative Risk (RR)**\nThe relative risk is the ratio of the incidence in the exposed group to the incidence in the unexposed group. It quantifies the strength of the association between the exposure and the disease. The point estimate of the relative risk is denoted as $\\hat{RR}$.\n$$\\hat{RR} = \\frac{I_e}{I_u} = \\frac{a/N_1}{c/N_0}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values from the problem:\n$$\\hat{RR} = \\frac{35/70}{15/110} = \\frac{0.5}{15/110} = 0.5 \\times \\frac{110}{15} = \\frac{55}{15} = \\frac{11}{3}$$\nNumerically, this is $\\hat{RR} \\approx 3.6667$.\n\n**3. Ninety-Five Percent Confidence Interval (95% CI) for the RR**\nThe problem specifies using the normal approximation on the logarithmic scale. This method involves calculating the confidence interval for the natural logarithm of the relative risk, $\\ln(\\hat{RR})$, and then exponentiating the interval's endpoints.\n\nThe variance of $\\ln(\\hat{RR})$ is approximated as:\n$$Var(\\ln(\\hat{RR})) \\approx \\frac{1-I_e}{a} + \\frac{1-I_u}{c}$$\nThis can be expressed using the cell counts from the contingency table:\n$$Var(\\ln(\\hat{RR})) \\approx \\frac{b}{a N_1} + \\frac{d}{c N_0}$$\nThe standard error of $\\ln(\\hat{RR})$ is the square root of this variance:\n$$SE(\\ln(\\hat{RR})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{b}{a N_1} + \\frac{d}{c N_0}}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$SE(\\ln(\\hat{RR})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{35}{35 \\times 70} + \\frac{95}{15 \\times 110}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{70} + \\frac{95}{1650}}$$\n$$SE(\\ln(\\hat{RR})) \\approx \\sqrt{0.0142857 + 0.0575758} = \\sqrt{0.0718615} \\approx 0.26807$$\nThe $95\\%$ confidence interval for $\\ln(\\hat{RR})$ is calculated as $\\ln(\\hat{RR}) \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\cdot SE(\\ln(\\hat{RR}))$.

Interpretation of Causal Association**\nThe analysis of causality involves applying established epidemiological criteria.\n\n*   **Temporality**: This criterion is satisfied. The exposure (eating the pâté) occurred at the training event, and the disease onset was subsequently observed between $24$ and $72$ hours later. The exposure preceded the outcome.\n\n*   **Strength of Association**: The calculated relative risk, $\\hat{RR} \\approx 3.67$, indicates a moderately strong association. Those who ate the pâté had a risk of illness that was over $3.6$ times higher than those who did not. The $95\\%$ CI of $(2.17, 6.20)$ does not include the null value of $1.0$, indicating that this association is statistically significant and not likely due to chance.\n\n*   **Biological Plausibility**: The proposed causal mechanism is biologically plausible. Chicken liver pâté, particularly if undercooked, is a known vehicle for foodborne pathogens like *Campylobacter* and *Salmonella*. The incubation period specified in the case definition ($24-72$ hours) is consistent with the known incubation periods for these bacterial infections.\n\nGiven the satisfaction of these fundamental criteria (temporality, strength of association, and biological plausibility), the evidence strongly suggests a causal relationship between consumption of the chicken liver pâté and the gastroenteritis outbreak.\n\nThe final answer is the point estimate of the relative risk, rounded to four significant figures.\n$\\hat{RR} = 11/3 \\approx 3.6666...$, which rounds to $3.667$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.667}$$", "id": "4516021"}]}
