In environmental risk assessment, the daily intake dose is defined fundamentally as the mass of contaminant taken into the body per unit body weight per unit time. Using this definition together with mass conservation and the physical meaning of concentration as mass per unit volume and inhalation rate as volume of air taken in per unit time, derive an expression for the daily intake dose in terms of concentration, inhalation rate, daily exposure fraction, exposure frequency, and body weight. Then, compute the daily intake dose for the following scientifically plausible parameters:\n\n- Time-weighted average concentration $C$ of the contaminant in air: $0.025$ milligram per cubic meter ($\\text{mg m}^{-3}$).\n- Inhalation rate $IR$: $19$ cubic meter per day ($\\text{m}^3 \\text{day}^{-1}$).\n- Fraction of each day with exposure $ET$: $0.4$ (unitless).\n- Fraction of days with exposure $EF$: $0.85$ (unitless).\n- Body weight $BW$: $72$ kilogram ($\\text{kg}$).\n\nShow explicitly how the units combine to yield the units of dose and briefly explain how the dose scales with body weight holding all other factors fixed.

The validation step confirms the problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\nThe daily intake dose, which we will denote by $D$, is defined as the mass of contaminant taken into the body per unit body weight per unit time. We seek an expression for $D$ with units of milligram per kilogram-day ($\\text{mg kg}^{-1} \\text{day}^{-1}$).\n\nStep 1: Derivation of the expression for Daily Intake Dose ($D$)\n\nWe begin from the fundamental definitions provided.\nThe concentration $C$ of the contaminant is the mass of the substance per unit volume of air.\n$$C \\quad [\\text{mass}/\\text{volume}] \\quad (\\text{e.g., } \\text{mg m}^{-3})$$\nThe inhalation rate $IR$ is the volume of air inhaled per unit time. The problem specifies this over a day.\n$$IR \\quad [\\text{volume}/\\text{time}] \\quad (\\text{e.g., } \\text{m}^{3} \\text{day}^{-1})$$\nThe mass of contaminant inhaled per unit time, assuming continuous exposure, would be the product $C \\times IR$. However, exposure is not continuous.\n\nThe factor $ET$ represents the fraction of each day during which exposure occurs. It is a unitless quantity. The volume of contaminated air inhaled on a day when exposure occurs is the total daily inhalation volume multiplied by this fraction.\nVolume inhaled on an exposure day = $IR \\times ET$.\n\nThe mass of contaminant inhaled on a single day of exposure, which we denote $M_{exp\\_day}$, is the concentration multiplied by the volume of contaminated air inhaled on that day.\n$$M_{exp\\_day} = C \\times (IR \\times ET)$$\nThe units of this quantity are $(\\text{mg/m}^3) \\times (\\text{m}^3\\text{/day}) = \\text{mg/day}$. This represents the mass intake rate on a day when exposure happens.\n\nThe factor $EF$ is the fraction of days on which exposure occurs. It is also a unitless quantity. To find the average mass of contaminant inhaled per day over a long period (including both exposure and non-exposure days), we must multiply the mass inhaled on an exposure day by the frequency of such days. Let this average daily mass intake be $\\bar{M}_{daily}$.\n$$\\bar{M}_{daily} = M_{exp\\_day} \\times EF = C \\times IR \\times ET \\times EF$$\nThis expression gives the long-term average mass of contaminant inhaled per day.\n\nFinally, the daily intake dose $D$ is defined as this average mass intake normalized by body weight, $BW$.\n$$D = \\frac{\\bar{M}_{daily}}{BW}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\bar{M}_{daily}$, we arrive at the general formula for the daily intake dose:\n$$D = \\frac{C \\times IR \\times ET \\times EF}{BW}$$\n\nStep 2: Unit Analysis\n\nWe verify that the derived expression yields the desired units for dose ($\\text{mg kg}^{-1} \\text{day}^{-1}$).\n$$[D] = \\frac{[C] \\times [IR] \\times [ET] \\times [EF]}{[BW]}$$\nSubstituting the units of each parameter:\n$$[D] = \\frac{(\\text{mg m}^{-3}) \\times (\\text{m}^{3} \\text{day}^{-1}) \\times (\\text{unitless}) \\times (\\text{unitless})}{(\\text{kg})}$$\nThe volume units ($\\text{m}^3$ and $\\text{m}^{-3}$) cancel each other out:\n$$[D] = \\frac{\\text{mg} \\times \\text{day}^{-1}}{\\text{kg}} = \\text{mg kg}^{-1} \\text{day}^{-1}$$\nThe unit analysis confirms the correctness of the derived formula.\n\nStep 3: Numerical Calculation\n\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n- Concentration $C = 0.025 \\text{ mg m}^{-3}$\n- Inhalation rate $IR = 19 \\text{ m}^{3} \\text{day}^{-1}$\n- Daily exposure fraction $ET = 0.4$\n- Exposure frequency $EF = 0.85$\n- Body weight $BW = 72 \\text{ kg}$\n\nWe substitute these values into our derived expression for $D$:\n$$D = \\frac{(0.025 \\text{ mg m}^{-3}) \\times (19 \\text{ m}^{3} \\text{day}^{-1}) \\times 0.4 \\times 0.85}{72 \\text{ kg}}$$\nFirst, we calculate the numerator, which represents the average daily mass intake, $\\bar{M}_{daily}$:\n$$\\bar{M}_{daily} = 0.025 \\times 19 \\times 0.4 \\times 0.85 = 0.1615 \\text{ mg day}^{-1}$$\nNext, we divide by the body weight to find the dose:\n$$D = \\frac{0.1615 \\text{ mg day}^{-1}}{72 \\text{ kg}} \\approx 0.002243055... \\text{ mg kg}^{-1} \\text{day}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$D \\approx 0.002243 \\text{ mg kg}^{-1} \\text{day}^{-1}$$\nIn scientific notation, this is $2.243 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ mg kg}^{-1} \\text{day}^{-1}$.\n\nStep 4: Scaling of Dose with Body Weight\n\nThe derived relationship for the dose is $D = \\frac{C \\times IR \\times ET \\times EF}{BW}$. If we hold all factors other than body weight constant, we can write the expression as:\n$$D = \\frac{K}{BW}$$\nwhere $K = C \\times IR \\times ET \\times EF$ is a constant representing the average rate of mass intake. This equation shows that the dose $D$ is inversely proportional to body weight $BW$. As body weight increases, the same total mass of inhaled contaminant is distributed over a larger body mass, resulting in a lower dose per unit of body mass. Conversely, individuals with lower body weight (such as children) would receive a higher dose under the same exposure conditions, a critical consideration in risk assessment.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2.243 \\times 10^{-3}}\n$$", "id": "4523170"}, {"introduction": "After quantifying exposure, a risk assessor needs a health-protective benchmark for comparison.

The solution will proceed by first deriving the RfD values based on the NOAEL and the LOAEL, respectively, and then evaluating each option.\n\n**Derivation of the Reference Dose (RfD)**\n\nThe fundamental principle for deriving a non-cancer RfD is to divide a selected point of departure (PoD) by the product of applicable uncertainty factors (UFs) and a modifying factor (MF).\nThe general formula is:\n$$ \\mathrm{RfD} = \\frac{\\mathrm{PoD}}{\\left( \\prod \\mathrm{UF}_i \\right) \\times \\mathrm{MF}} $$\n\n**Case 1: RfD based on the NOAEL**\nThis is the standard, preferred approach when a reliable NOAEL is available.\n\n1.  The PoD is the $\\mathrm{NOAEL}$: $\\mathrm{PoD} = 4\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$.\n2.  The composite uncertainty factor ($\\mathrm{UF_{Total}}$) is the product of the individual UFs. When using a NOAEL, the $\\mathrm{UFL}$ is $1$.\n    $$ \\mathrm{UF_{Total, NOAEL}} = \\mathrm{UFA} \\times \\mathrm{UFH} \\times \\mathrm{UFD} \\times \\mathrm{UFL} = 10 \\times 10 \\times 3 \\times 1 = 300 $$\n3.

The PoD is the $\\mathrm{LOAEL}$: $\\mathrm{PoD} = 12\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$.\n2.  The composite uncertainty factor must include a factor for LOAEL-to-NOAEL extrapolation. The problem specifies that the effects at the LOAEL are \"not minimal\" and that the \"default upper end\" for $\\mathrm{UFL}$ should be used. This value is $10$.\n    $$ \\mathrm{UF_{Total, LOAEL}} = \\mathrm{UFA} \\times \\mathrm{UFH} \\times \\mathrm{UFD} \\times \\mathrm{UFL} = 10 \\times 10 \\times 3 \\times 10 = 3000 $$\n3.

The added uncertainty when NOAEL is unavailable is a $3$-fold factor.**\n\n-   This option incorrectly applies $\\mathrm{UFL}=3$, which is reserved for *minimal* effects, contradicting the explicit problem statement that effects were \"not minimal\". Standard practice and the problem's direction to use the \"default upper end\" indicate $\\mathrm{UFL}=10$. Making the calculation with this incorrect factor, $\\mathrm{RfD_{LOAEL}} = 12 / (10 \\times 10 \\times 3 \\times 3) = 12/900 = 1/75 \\approx 1.33 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$.

First, it incorrectly claims the LOAEL-based RfD must be higher; our calculation shows it is lower because the multiplicative $\\mathrm{UFL}$ of $10$ outweighs the threefold higher PoD value ($\\mathrm{LOAEL}/\\mathrm{NOAEL} = 3$). Second, it incorrectly suggests that UFs are additive. UFs are always multiplicative in the standard RfD equation.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.

Compute the Hazard Quotient ($HQ$) for each chemical using the central estimates.**\nThe central estimates for exposure ($E_j$) and reference dose ($RfD_j$) are used.\n\nFor Chemical $1$:\n$$HQ_{1} = \\frac{E_{1}}{RfD_{1}} = \\frac{0.009}{0.010} = 0.9$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $HQ_{1} = 0.9000$.\n\nFor Chemical $2$:\n$$HQ_{2} = \\frac{E_{2}}{RfD_{2}} = \\frac{0.006}{0.005} = 1.2$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $HQ_{2} = 1.200$.\n\nFor Chemical $3$:\n$$HQ_{3} = \\frac{E_{3}}{RfD_{3}} = \\frac{0.004}{0.020} = 0.2$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $HQ_{3} = 0.2000$.\n\n**2. Compute the Hazard Index ($HI$) using the central estimates.**\nThe central estimate for the Hazard Index, $HI_{\\text{central}}$, is the sum of the individual central-estimate $HQ$ values.\n$$HI_{\\text{central}} = HQ_{1} + HQ_{2} + HQ_{3} = 0.9 + 1.2 + 0.2 = 2.3$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $HI_{\\text{central}} = 2.300$.\n\n**3. Compute the worst-case upper-bound Hazard Index ($HI_{\\text{upper-bound}}$).**\nTo compute a worst-case scenario, one must maximize the $HQ$ for each chemical. The ratio $E/RfD$ is maximized by using the highest plausible exposure and the lowest plausible reference dose.\nLet $E_{j, \\text{upper}}$ be the upper plausible exposure and $RfD_{j, \\text{lower}}$ be the lower plausible reference dose.\n$$E_{j, \\text{upper}} = 1.3 \\times E_{j}$$\n$$RfD_{j, \\text{lower}} = 0.8 \\times RfD_{j}$$\nThe upper-bound $HQ$ for chemical $j$, denoted $HQ_{j, \\text{upper}}$, is:\n$$HQ_{j, \\text{upper}} = \\frac{E_{j, \\text{upper}}}{RfD_{j, \\text-lower}} = \\frac{1.3 \\times E_{j}}{0.8 \\times RfD_{j}} = \\frac{1.3}{0.8} \\times \\frac{E_{j}}{RfD_{j}}$$\nThe factor $\\frac{1.3}{0.8} = 1.625$.\n\nThe worst-case upper-bound Hazard Index, $HI_{\\text{upper-bound}}$, is the sum of these individual upper-bound Hazard Quotients.\n$$HI_{\\text{upper-bound}} = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} HQ_{j, \\text{upper}} = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\left( \\frac{1.3}{0.8} \\times \\frac{E_{j}}{RfD_{j}} \\right)$$\nBy distributing the constant factor, we get:\n$$HI_{\\text{upper-bound}} = \\frac{1.3}{0.8} \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\frac{E_{j}}{RfD_{j}} = \\frac{1.3}{0.8} \\times HI_{\\text{central}}$$\nSubstituting the previously calculated values:\n$$HI_{\\text{upper-bound}} = 1.625 \\times 2.3 = 3.7375$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $HI_{\\text{upper-bound}} = 3.738$.\n\nThe final results, rounded to four significant figures, are:\n- $HQ_{1} = 0.9000$\n- $HQ_{2} = 1.200$\n- $HQ_{3} = 0.2000$\n- $HI_{\\text{central}} = 2.300$\n- $HI_{\\text{upper-bound}} = 3.738$\n\nThese values are compiled into the required row vector format.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.9000 & 1.200 & 0.2000 & 2.300 & 3.738 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4523079"}]}
