Building from expected utility theory, an adult chooses the behavior with the greater net utility, defined as perceived benefits minus perceived costs. Let the baseline option of continuing current consumption have perceived benefits $U_{\\text{old}}$ and perceived costs $C_{\\text{old}}$, and the new option of reducing consumption by $0.20$ have perceived benefits $U_{\\text{new}}$ and perceived costs $C_{\\text{new}}$. The decision rule is to choose the new option if $U_{\\text{new}} - C_{\\text{new}} > U_{\\text{old}} - C_{\\text{old}}$.\n\nAssume a simple linear-additive utility model:\n- The taste satisfaction from full consumption is $s$ units, with benefit weight $\\alpha$, so the perceived benefit of taste under the old option is $U_{\\text{old}} = \\alpha s$.\n- The perceived health harm from full consumption is $h$ units, with cost weight $\\beta$, so the perceived cost under the old option is $C_{\\text{old}} = \\beta h$.\n- Under the new option (reducing consumption by $0.20$), taste satisfaction and health harm both scale linearly with the maintained proportion $1 - 0.20 = 0.80$, so $U_{\\text{new}}^{0} = \\alpha (0.80)s$ and $C_{\\text{new}}^{0} = \\beta (0.80)h + c_{\\text{switch}}$, where $c_{\\text{switch}}$ is the inconvenience cost of changing routine.\n- The campaign operates by increasing the perceived benefit of the new option by an additive amount $\\Delta B$ (e.g., reframing long-term health gains), so $U_{\\text{new}} = U_{\\text{new}}^{0} + \\Delta B$.\n\nGiven the parameters $s = 10$, $h = 8$, $\\alpha = 1$, $\\beta = 0.5$, and $c_{\\text{switch}} = 1$, compute the minimum increase in perceived benefit $\\Delta B_{\\min}$ required to shift the choice threshold, that is, the smallest $\\Delta B$ such that $U_{\\text{new}} - C_{\\text{new}} > U_{\\text{old}} - C_{\\text{old}}$ holds for the average adult.

The primary outcome is engagement, defined as whether a user clicks the “Schedule Now” button within $72$ hours of first viewing the assigned message. Each message exposure to a unique user constitutes one independent Bernoulli trial with probability of success equal to the engagement rate for that message.\n\nFrom past campaigns, the department estimates the engagement rate for a standard informational message to be $p_{A} = 0.06$.

No additional units are required.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the minimum sample size per arm, $n$, for a two-sample test of proportions, given a significance level $\\alpha$, power $1-\\beta$, and specific proportions under the null and alternative hypotheses.\n\nFirst, we establish the statistical framework. Let $p_A$ and $p_B$ be the true engagement rates for message variants A and B, respectively. We are testing the null hypothesis $H_0$ against a two-sided alternative hypothesis $H_A$:\n$$ H_0: p_A = p_B $$\n$$ H_A: p_A \\neq p_B $$\nThe sample sizes for the two arms are equal, $n_A = n_B = n$. Let $\\hat{p}_A$ and $\\hat{p}_B$ be the observed sample proportions of engagement in each arm. The test is based on the difference in sample proportions, $\\hat{p}_B - \\hat{p}_A$.\n\nUnder the large-sample normal approximation, the test statistic for the difference in proportions (using a pooled variance estimate, which is standard for this type of test) is:\n$$ Z = \\frac{(\\hat{p}_B - \\hat{p}_A) - (p_B - p_A)}{\\sqrt{\\hat{p}_{pool}(1-\\hat{p}_{pool})\\left(\\frac{1}{n_A} + \\frac{1}{n_B}\\right)}} $$\nUnder $H_0$, $p_A = p_B$, and the statistic becomes:\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\hat{p}_B - \\hat{p}_A}{\\sqrt{\\hat{p}_{pool}(1-\\hat{p}_{pool})\\frac{2}{n}}} $$\nwhere $\\hat{p}_{pool} = \\frac{n\\hat{p}_A + n\\hat{p}_B}{2n} = \\frac{\\hat{p}_A + \\hat{p}_B}{2}$ is the pooled sample proportion. Under $H_0$, $Z$ is approximately distributed as a standard normal random variable, $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$.\n\nThe significance level is given as $\\alpha = 0.05$. For a two-sided test, we reject $H_0$ if the absolute value of the test statistic exceeds the critical value $z_{\\alpha/2}$.\n$$ |Z| > z_{\\alpha/2} $$\nSince we are given that $p_B > p_A$ under the alternative hypothesis, we can focus on the upper tail of the distribution for the power calculation. The rejection region is defined by the critical value $C$ for the observed difference, where we reject $H_0$ if $\\hat{p}_B - \\hat{p}_A > C$. This critical value $C$ is determined by the significance level $\\alpha$:\n$$ C = z_{\\alpha/2} \\times (\\text{Std. Error of difference under } H_0) $$\nFor the purpose of sample size calculation, we approximate the standard error under $H_0$ by using the average of the proportions specified in the alternative hypothesis, $\\bar{p} = \\frac{p_A + p_B}{2}$.\nThe variance of the difference under $H_0$ is thus estimated as $\\text{Var}(\\hat{p}_B - \\hat{p}_A) = \\frac{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{n}$.\nSo, the critical value $C$ is:\n$$ C = z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{n}} $$\n\nNext, we consider the power of the test, $1-\\beta = 0.80$.
