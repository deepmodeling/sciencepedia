According to Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), self-efficacy is influenced by mastery experiences, vicarious learning, verbal persuasion, and physiological states, and changes arise through triadic reciprocal determinism among personal factors, behavior, and environment. Consider a participant whose self-efficacy, denoted by $E_t$, is measured once per week and scaled to the interval $[0,1]$, where $E_t = 1$ represents full confidence and $E_t = 0$ represents no confidence.\n\nAssume the following modeling principle derived from core SCT constructs and standard behavioral change modeling: under a constant weekly intervention environment, the weekly change in self-efficacy is proportional to its remaining “headroom” to full confidence. That is, the incremental effect per week is proportional to $1 - E_t$ with proportionality parameter $k$ that captures the strength of weekly mastery reinforcement and vicarious experience in a stable program. Use this principle to derive a first-order linear recurrence for $E_t$, then solve it in closed form.\n\nFor a participant with initial self-efficacy $E_0 = 0.4$ and a weekly proportionality parameter $k = 0.1$, compute the self-efficacy after $8$ weeks, $E_8$.

The model is based on a principle derived from Social Cognitive Theory.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\nThe givens are:\n1.  Self-efficacy at week $t$ is denoted by $E_t$, scaled to the interval $[0, 1]$.\n2.  The weekly change in self-efficacy, $E_{t+1} - E_t$, is proportional to the \"headroom\" to full confidence, which is $1 - E_t$.\n3.  The proportionality parameter is $k$.\n4.  The initial self-efficacy is $E_0 = 0.4$.\n5.  The proportionality parameter is $k = 0.1$.\n6.  The task is to compute $E_8$ and round the result to four significant figures.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded as a simplified mathematical model of a behavioral theory concept. It is a common approach in quantitative psychology and behavioral science to use first-order linear models to approximate dynamic processes. The problem is well-posed, with sufficient information provided to derive and solve the model. The parameters are physically realistic within the model's context. The problem is objective and contains no contradictory information. Therefore, the problem is valid and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core modeling principle states that the change in self-efficacy from week $t$ to week $t+1$ is proportional to the difference between the maximum possible efficacy ($1$) and the current efficacy ($E_t$). We can write this relationship mathematically. The change in self-efficacy is $\\Delta E_t = E_{t+1} - E_t$. The \"headroom\" is $1 - E_t$. The proportionality is expressed as:\n$$E_{t+1} - E_t = k(1 - E_t)$$\nwhere $k$ is the proportionality constant. This is a first-order linear recurrence relation. We can rearrange it to express $E_{t+1}$ explicitly in terms of $E_t$:\n$$E_{t+1} = E_t + k(1 - E_t)$$\n$$E_{t+1} = E_t - k E_t + k$$\n$$E_{t+1} = (1-k)E_t + k$$\nThis is the recurrence relation for $E_t$. It is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation of the form $x_{n+1} = a x_n + b$, with $a = 1-k$ and $b=k$.\n\nTo find a closed-form solution for $E_t$, we first find the fixed point (or equilibrium state) $E^*$ of the recurrence. The fixed point is the value of $E_t$ for which $E_{t+1} = E_t = E^*$.\n$$E^* = (1-k)E^* + k$$\n$$E^* - (1-k)E^* = k$$\n$$E^*(1 - (1-k)) = k$$\n$$E^*k = k$$\nAssuming $k \\neq 0$, the fixed point is $E^* = 1$. This means that as $t \\to \\infty$, the self-efficacy approaches full confidence, which is consistent with the model's premise of continuous improvement.\n\nNow, we define a new variable, $D_t$, as the difference between the self-efficacy at time $t$ and the fixed point: $D_t = E_t - E^* = E_t - 1$. We can express the recurrence in terms of $D_t$:\n$$D_{t+1} = E_{t+1} - 1$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E_{t+1}$:\n$$D_{t+1} = \\left( (1-k)E_t + k \\right) - 1$$\n$$D_{t+1} = (1-k)E_t - (1-k)$$\n$$D_{t+1} = (1-k)(E_t - 1)$$\nSince $D_t = E_t - 1$, we have:\n$$D_{t+1} = (1-k)D_t$$\nThis is a simple geometric progression. The solution is $D_t = D_0 (1-k)^t$.\nSubstituting back $D_t = E_t - 1$ and $D_0 = E_0 - 1$, we get:\n$$E_t - 1 = (E_0 - 1)(1-k)^t$$\nSolving for $E_t$ gives the closed-form solution:\n$$E_t = 1 + (E_0 - 1)(1-k)^t$$\n$$E_t = 1 - (1-E_0)(1-k)^t$$\n\nThe problem provides the specific values $E_0 = 0.4$ and $k=0.1$. We are asked to compute the self-efficacy after $8$ weeks, which corresponds to $t=8$.\nWe substitute these values into the closed-form solution:\n$$E_8 = 1 - (1 - 0.4)(1 - 0.1)^8$$\n$$E_8 = 1 - (0.6)(0.9)^8$$\nNow, we must compute the value of $(0.9)^8$:\n$$(0.9)^2 = 0.81$$\n$$(0.9)^4 = (0.81)^2 = 0.6561$$\n$$(0.9)^8 = (0.6561)^2 = 0.43046721$$\nNext, substitute this value back into the expression for $E_8$:\n$$E_8 = 1 - 0.6 \\times 0.43046721$$\n$$E_8 = 1 - 0.258280326$$\n$$E_8 = 0.741719674$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
