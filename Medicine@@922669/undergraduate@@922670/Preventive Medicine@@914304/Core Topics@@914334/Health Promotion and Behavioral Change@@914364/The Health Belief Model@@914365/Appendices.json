A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe model posits a rational agent who decides whether to take a preventive action based on a cost-benefit analysis of expected outcomes. Let $E_{0}$ be the expected burden without action and $E_{1}$ be the expected burden with action.\n\nThe expected burden without action is given as the product of perceived susceptibility and severity:\n$$E_{0} = p_{s} d$$\n\nIf action is taken, the disease burden is reduced by a proportion $b$, but a cost $c$ is incurred. The total expected burden with action is the sum of the remaining disease burden and the barrier cost:\n$$E_{1} = (1-b) p_{s} d + c$$\n\nThe problem states that \"action is taken if and only if the net expected change in burden due to action minus the barrier cost is positive.\" Let's formalize this.\nThe \"change in burden due to action\" refers to the reduction in the disease-related burden, which is the initial burden minus the remaining burden:\n$$\\text{Reduction in disease burden} = (p_{s} d) - (1-b) p_{s} d = p_{s} d - p_{s} d + b p_{s} d = b p_{s} d$$\nThe decision rule states that action is taken if this reduction exceeds the barrier cost $c$:\n$$b p_{s} d - c > 0$$\nwhich simplifies to the core decision inequality:\n$$b p_{s} d > c$$\nThis is consistent with the rational choice criterion that action should be taken if the expected burden with action is less than the expected burden without it, i.e., $E_{1}  E_{0}$:\n$$(1-b) p_{s} d + c  p_{s} d$$\n$$p_{s} d - b p_{s} d + c  p_{s} d$$\n$$-b p_{s} d + c  0$$\n$$c  b p_{s} d$$\nThis confirms the decision inequality is correct.\n\nThere are two tasks:\n1.  Determine the action indicator $I$ for the given values.\n2.  Compute the minimal benefit $b_{\\min}$ required for action.\n\n**1. Determine the Action Indicator $I$**\nWe are given $p_{s} = 0.2$, $d = 5$, $b = 0.6$, and $c = 0.4$. We test the decision inequality $b p_{s} d > c$.\n\nFirst, calculate the product $b p_{s} d$:\n$$b p_{s} d = (0.6)(0.2)(5) = (0.6)(1) = 0.6$$\nNow, compare this value to the cost $c$:\n$$c = 0.4$$\nThe inequality is $0.6 > 0.4$, which is true.\nSince the condition is met, action is predicted. By definition, the action indicator $I$ is $1$.\n$$I = 1$$\n\n**2. Compute the Minimal Benefit $b_{\\min}$**\nThe minimal benefit required for action, denoted $b_{\\min}$, is the threshold value of $b$ at which a rational agent becomes willing to act. This corresponds to the boundary condition of our decision inequality, $b p_{s} d > c$. To find this threshold, we solve for $b$:\n$$b > \\frac{c}{p_{s} d}$$\nAction is taken for any benefit $b$ strictly greater than the ratio $\\frac{c}{p_{s} d}$. The minimal value of $b$ that satisfies this condition is the infimum of the set of possible values for $b$, which is the threshold itself. Thus, we define $b_{\\min}$ as:\n$$b_{\\min} = \\frac{c}{p_{s} d}$$\nNow, we substitute the given values for $c$, $p_{s}$, and $d$:\n$$b_{\\min} = \\frac{0.4}{(0.2)(5)} = \\frac{0.4}{1.0} = 0.4$$\nThis value must be within the permissible range for benefit, $b \\in [0,1]$. Since $0 \\le 0.4 \\le 1$, this is a valid threshold for the benefit. For any benefit $b > 0.4$, action is predicted, while for $b \\le 0.4$, it is not.\n$$b_{\\min} = 0.4$$\n\nThe required outputs are $I = 1$ and $b_{\\min} = 0.4$.
