For a given individual, three salient outcomes have been elicited, and their belief strengths and outcome evaluations are summarized as vectors $b=[0.8,\\,0.3,\\,-0.6]$ and $e=[3,\\,1,\\,2]$, where each $e_i$ is measured on a bipolar semantic differential scale from $-3$ to $+3$ and each $b_i$ is a unitless belief strength that can be positive or negative to reflect facilitative or inhibitory expectation regarding the outcome.\n\nStarting from the following foundational principles of the EV approach, derive the general form of a valid unidimensional attitude index $A$ in terms of $b_i$ and $e_i$:\n1) Independence and additivity across outcomes: the total attitude equals the sum of contributions from each outcome.\n2) Linearity in belief strength: holding the evaluation fixed, doubling $b_i$ doubles that outcome’s contribution to the attitude.\n3) Linearity and polarity in evaluation: holding the belief strength fixed, the contribution varies linearly with $e_i$ and reverses sign if $e_i$ reverses sign.\n4) Null effects: if either $b_i=0$ or $e_i=0$, the contribution of that outcome is $0$.\n\nCalibrate the overall scale so that a single outcome with $b_i=1$ and $e_i=1$ increases $A$ by exactly $1$ unit.

This exercise is crucial for understanding how the relative importance of each component influences the final intention.", "problem": "A hospital-based medical psychology team is applying the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to predict a patient's intention to adhere to a newly prescribed antihypertensive regimen. In the TPB, the intention construct is determined by three standardized psychological components: Attitude toward the behavior ($A$), Subjective Norm ($SN$), and Perceived Behavioral Control ($PBC$). The team has pre-specified policy weights reflecting the relative contribution of each component to intention, denoted by $w_{a}$ for Attitude, $w_{s}$ for Subjective Norm, and $w_{p}$ for Perceived Behavioral Control. All three component scores are standardized (zero-mean, unit-variance) $z$-scores so they are commensurate, and all weights are nonnegative real numbers.\n\nAssume the following foundational measurement-theoretic properties for the intention index aggregator used by the team:\n- Additive separability of component effects: holding two components fixed, changing one component changes intention independently of the others.\n- Positive homogeneity of degree one in the components: scaling all components by a positive constant $k$ scales intention by the same factor $k$.\n- Null contribution at zero: a component equal to zero contributes zero to intention.\n- Monotonicity in each component given nonnegative weights: increasing any of $A$, $SN$, or $PBC$ (with its weight held fixed and nonnegative) does not decrease intention.\n\nStarting only from these assumptions and the core TPB idea that intention is determined by the three components and their weights, derive the expression for the latent intention index $I$ and then compute its value for the following patient profile: $A = 1.2$, $SN = 0.8$, $PBC = 1.5$, with policy weights $w_{a} = 0.4$, $w_{s} = 0.3$, and $w_{p} = 0.5$.\n\nFor clinical decision-making, the hospital uses a discrete intention category $C$ on a $0$ to $3$ scale, where the observed category is the nearest integer to the latent index, clipped to the bounds.

Let $I$ be a function of the three components $A$, $SN$, and $PBC$. The weights $w_{a}$, $w_{s}$, and $w_{p}$ are parameters of this function.\n$$I = f(A, SN, PBC)$$\n\n1.  **Additive separability**: This property implies that the function $f$ can be written as a sum of functions of each individual component.\n    $$I = f_A(A) + f_{SN}(SN) + f_{PBC}(PBC)$$\n\n2.  **Positive homogeneity of degree one**: For any positive constant $k > 0$, the function must satisfy:\n    $$f(kA, kSN, kPBC) = k \\cdot f(A, SN, PBC)$$\n    Substituting the separable form from the first property:\n    $$f_A(kA) + f_{SN}(kSN) + f_{PBC}(kPBC) = k \\cdot [f_A(A) + f_{SN}(SN) + f_{PBC}(PBC)]$$\n    This equation must hold for all values of $A$, $SN$, and $PBC$. This implies that each individual function must also be positive homogeneous of degree one. For example, by setting $SN=0$ and $PBC=0$, we get $f_A(kA) = k \\cdot f_A(A)$. A function satisfying this property is a linear function passing through the origin. Therefore, each component function must be of the form:\n    $$f_A(A) = c_A \\cdot A$$\n    $$f_{SN}(SN) = c_{SN} \\cdot SN$$\n    $$f_{PBC}(PBC) = c_{PBC} \\cdot PBC$$\n    where $c_A$, $c_{SN}$, and $c_{PBC}$ are constants of proportionality.\n\n3.  **Role of Weights**: The problem states that intention is determined by the components and their weights. It is logical to identify the constants of proportionality with the respective policy weights.\n    $$c_A = w_{a}, \\quad c_{SN} = w_{s}, \\quad c_{PBC} = w_{p}$$\n    This establishes the functional form as a weighted linear combination:\n    $$I = w_{a}A + w_{s}SN + w_{p}PBC$$\n\n4.  **Verification with remaining properties**:\n    - **Null contribution at zero**: If any component, say $A$, is zero, its contribution to the index is $w_{a} \\cdot 0 = 0$. This holds.\n    - **Monotonicity**: The partial derivative of $I$ with respect to any component, for example $A$, is $\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial A} = w_{a}$.
