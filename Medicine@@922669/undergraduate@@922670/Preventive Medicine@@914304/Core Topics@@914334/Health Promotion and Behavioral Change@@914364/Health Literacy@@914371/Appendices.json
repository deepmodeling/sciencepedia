In readability assessment, a widely used empirical model estimates grade level as a linear combination of two text features grounded in definitions: average sentence length and average syllables per word. Let $W$ denote the total number of words, $S$ denote the total number of sentences, and $Y$ denote the total number of syllables in the text. The average sentence length is $W/S$ and the average syllables per word is $Y/W$.

The context of health literacy and preventive medicine is a standard application for such models. The provided coefficients are correct for the formula.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL) is defined as a linear function of the average sentence length (ASL) and the average syllables per word (ASW). The general formula is:\n$$ \\text{FKGL} = a \\cdot (\\text{ASL}) + b \\cdot (\\text{ASW}) + c $$\nThe variables ASL and ASW are defined in terms of the total number of words $W$, total sentences $S$, and total syllables $Y$:\n$$ \\text{ASL} = \\frac{W}{S} $$\n$$ \\text{ASW} = \\frac{Y}{W} $$\nSubstituting these definitions into the FKGL formula gives:\n$$ \\text{FKGL} = a \\left( \\frac{W}{S} \\right) + b \\left( \\frac{Y}{W} \\right) + c $$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n-   $a = 0.39$\n-   $b = 11.8$\n-   $c = -15.59$\n-   $W = 150$\n-   $S = 8$\n-   $Y = 220$\n\nFirst, we compute the values for ASL and ASW using the given data for the brochure.\n$$ \\text{ASL} = \\frac{150}{8} = 18.75 $$\n$$ \\text{ASW} = \\frac{220}{150} = \\frac{22}{15} $$\nNow, we substitute these values and the given coefficients into the FKGL formula:\n$$ \\text{FKGL} = (0.39) \\left( 18.75 \\right) + (11.8) \\left( \\frac{22}{15} \\right) - 15.59 $$\nWe proceed with the calculation:\nThe first term is:\n$$ (0.39) \\times (18.75) = 7.3125 $$\nThe second term is:\n$$ (11.8) \\times \\left( \\frac{22}{15} \\right) = \\frac{259.6}{15} \\approx 17.30666... $$\nCombining all terms:\n$$ \\text{FKGL} = 7.3125 + 17.30666... - 15.59 $$\n$$ \\text{FKGL} = 24.6191666... - 15.59 $$\n$$ \\text{FKGL} = 9.0291666... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\text{FKGL} \\approx 9.029 $$\nThis value represents the U.S. grade level required to understand the text.\n\nFor the second part of the task, we must interpret this result. A FKGL of approximately $9.0$ indicates that the brochure is written at a 9th-grade reading level. In preventive medicine and public health, the standard recommendation is to create materials for the general public at or below an 8th-grade reading level, as this corresponds to the average reading ability of adults in the United States. A 9th-grade level is higher than this target. Therefore, the brochure is likely too complex for a substantial portion of the intended broad adult audience and may impede health literacy rather than support it.
