In the comparable population without the program, the baseline one-year incidence of major depressive episodes is $I_0 = 0.08$ per person-year.

We can proceed with the calculation.\n\nThe problem asks for the calculation of two standard epidemiological metrics: the absolute risk reduction ($ARR$) and the number needed to treat ($NNT$). We are provided with the baseline incidence, the proportional relative risk reduction, and the definitions of all relevant terms.\n\nFirst, we establish the given information and definitions in mathematical form.\nThe baseline one-year incidence in the population without the program (control group) is $I_0 = 0.08$.\nThe proportional relative risk reduction is $RR_p = 0.25$.\nLet $I_1$ be the one-year incidence in the population with the program (intervention group).\n\nThe proportional relative risk reduction, $RR_p$, is defined as the fractional decrease in risk relative to the baseline risk. The formula provided is:\n$$RR_p = \\frac{I_0 - I_1}{I_0}$$\nThis can also be expressed as $RR_p = 1 - \\frac{I_1}{I_0}$, where $\\frac{I_1}{I_0}$ is the relative risk ($RR$). We can use this relationship to find the incidence in the intervention group, $I_1$. Substituting the given values into the definition:\n$$0.25 = \\frac{0.08 - I_1}{0.08}$$\nTo solve for $I_1$, we first multiply both sides of the equation by $0.08$:\n$$0.25 \\times 0.08 = 0.08 - I_1$$\n$$0.02 = 0.08 - I_1$$\nRearranging the equation to isolate $I_1$:\n$$I_1 = 0.08 - 0.02$$\n$$I_1 = 0.06$$\nThus, the one-year incidence of major depressive episodes in the group participating in the resilience-building program is $0.06$ per person-year.\n\nNext, we compute the absolute risk reduction ($ARR$). The problem defines this as the difference in incidence between the baseline group and the intervention group:\n$$ARR = I_0 - I_1$$\nSubstituting the values of $I_0$ and the newly calculated $I_1$:\n$$ARR = 0.08 - 0.06$$\n$$ARR = 0.02$$\nThe absolute risk reduction is $0.02$. This value is a unitless decimal, as required.\n\nFinally, we compute the number needed to treat ($NNT$) per year. The problem defines this as the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction over one year:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nUsing our calculated value for $ARR$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.02}$$\nTo simplify this fraction, we can express the denominator $0.02$ as $\\frac{2}{100}$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{\\frac{2}{100}} = \\frac{100}{2}$$\n$$NNT = 50$$\nThe number needed to treat is $50$. This means that, on average, $50$ individuals must participate in the program for one year to prevent one additional case of a major depressive episode that would have occurred without the program.\n\nThe problem requires the final answers for $ARR$ and $NNT$ to be reported together as a row matrix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.02 & 50 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4548640"}, {"introduction": "Mental health research often summarizes an intervention's impact using a standardized effect size, like Cohen's $d$. While essential for comparing results across different studies, this metric can feel abstract. This exercise will guide you through the process of converting a standardized effect size from a hypothetical meta-analysis into a concrete, expected change in a raw score, such as on a life satisfaction scale. This skill is critical for interpreting the practical significance of research evidence for your own program planning [@problem_id:4548653].", "problem": "A university preventive medicine team evaluates a brief gratitude journaling intervention aimed at mental health promotion and resilience building among undergraduates.

The term \"expected increase\" is clearly defined by the context as the change in the mean score, $\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{0}$. The assumptions are explicit and serve to make the problem tractable and self-contained. For example, the assumption that the pooled standard deviation is approximated by the baseline standard deviation is a common and practical simplification in research planning. A quick check of the expected outcome shows that the new mean would be $\\mu_1 = \\mu_0 + d\\sigma_0 = 5.0 + (0.4)(1.2) = 5.0 + 0.48 = 5.48$, which is well within the $1$ to $7$ scale, validating the assumption of no ceiling effects. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows.\n\nThe standardized mean difference, Cohen's $d$, is defined as the difference between two means divided by a pooled standard deviation. Let $\\mu_{1}$ be the expected mean life satisfaction score post-intervention and $\\mu_{0}$ be the baseline mean score. The formula for Cohen's $d$ is:\n$$d = \\frac{\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{0}}{\\sigma_{pooled}}$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{pooled}$ is the pooled standard deviation of the two groups (in this case, pre- and post-intervention, or intervention and control).\n\nThe problem asks for the expected increase in the raw life satisfaction score, which is the difference in the means, $\\Delta\\mu = \\mu_{1} - \\mu_{0}$.\n\nThe problem states that the pooled standard deviation, $\\sigma_{pooled}$, can be approximated by the baseline standard deviation, $\\sigma_{0}$. This is a key assumption that allows for a direct calculation.\nTherefore, we can write:\n$$d \\approx \\frac{\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{0}}{\\sigma_{0}}$$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the increase in the mean score, $\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{0}$:\n$$\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{0} \\approx d \\times \\sigma_{0}$$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- $d = 0.4$\n- $\\sigma_{0} = 1.2$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation gives the expected increase in the raw score:\n$$\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{0} = 0.4 \\times 1.2$$\n$$\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{0} = 0.48$$\n\nThus, the expected increase in the raw life satisfaction score attributable to the intervention is $0.48$.

You do not need to round.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and computation of a program's effect, specifically the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT), using provided pre- and post-intervention mean outcomes for a treated and a comparison group. The derivation must begin from the definitions of potential outcomes and the parallel trends assumption.\n\nLet the treatment status be denoted by an indicator variable $D$, where $D=1$ for an individual on the treated campus and $D=0$ for an individual on the comparison campus. Let the time period be denoted by $t$, where $t=\\mathrm{pre}$ for the pre-program period and $t=\\mathrm{post}$ for the post-program period.\n\nWe use the potential outcomes framework to define the causal effect. For any individual, let $Y(1)$ be their potential outcome (Distress Severity Index score) if they receive the treatment, and let $Y(0)$ be their potential outcome if they do not receive the treatment. The problem occurs in two time periods. Thus, we define $Y_t(d)$ as the potential outcome for an individual at time $t$ under treatment status $d \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\nThe parameter of interest is the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) at the post-program time. This is the expected difference between the outcome with treatment and the outcome without treatment, for those who actually received the treatment. Formally,\n$$\n\\text{ATT} = E[Y_{\\mathrm{post}}(1) - Y_{\\mathrm{post}}(0) \\mid D=1]\n$$\nWe can separate this expectation:\n$$\n\\text{ATT} = E[Y_{\\mathrm{post}}(1) \\mid D=1] - E[Y_{\\mathrm{post}}(0) \\mid D=1]\n$$\nThe first term, $E[Y_{\\mathrm{post}}(1) \\mid D=1]$, is the expected outcome for the treated group at the post-program time, given they received the treatment. This is an observable quantity, which is estimated by the sample mean of the treated group at the post-program time, $Y_{T,\\mathrm{post}}$.\n$$\nE[Y_{\\mathrm{post}}(1) \\mid D=1] = Y_{T,\\mathrm{post}}\n$$\nThe second term, $E[Y_{\\mathrm{post}}(0) \\mid D=1]$, is the expected outcome for the treated group at the post-program time *had they not received the treatment*. This is a counterfactual outcome and is fundamentally unobservable. The core of the difference-in-differences (DID) method is to construct an estimate for this counterfactual term using the available data.\n\nThis is achieved by invoking the **parallel trends assumption**. This assumption posits that the average change in the outcome from the pre- to post-period for the treated group, had they not been treated, would have been the same as the average change in the outcome for the comparison group. Mathematically, it is expressed as:\n$$\nE[Y_{\\mathrm{post}}(0) \\mid D=1] - E[Y_{\\mathrm{pre}}(0) \\mid D=1] = E[Y_{\\mathrm{post}}(0) \\mid D=0] - E[Y_{\\mathrm{pre}}(0) \\mid D=0]\n$$\nThe right-hand side of this equation is entirely observable.
