This exercise introduces the foundational skill of calculating rates, which are essential for tracking the scale of the problem.

It provides all necessary data for the requested calculations and interpretations.\n\nThe problem requires the computation and interpretation of two types of rates for road traffic events: population-based incidence rates and exposure-based rates.\n\nA rate is a measure of the frequency with which an event occurs in a defined population over a specified period of time. Its general form is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Number of events}}{\\text{Population at risk (or exposure)}} \\times \\text{Scaling Factor}\n$$\nThe \"population at risk\" can be the total number of individuals in a community (for a population-based rate) or a measure of exposure to risk, such as vehicle-kilometers traveled (for an exposure-based rate).\n\nThe given data are:\n- Number of police-reported road traffic crashes, $N_c = 1,200$.\n- Number of hospital-admitted road traffic injuries, $N_i = 300$.\n- Number of road traffic deaths, $N_d = 50$.\n- Mid-year resident population, $P = 500,000$.\n- Total annual vehicle-kilometers traveled (VKT), $V = 1.5 \\times 10^{9}$.\n- The time interval for all counts is one year.\n\nFirst, we compute the rates per $100,000$ population.

Crash rate per $100,000$ population:\n    $$\n    R_{c, \\text{pop}} = \\frac{N_c}{P} \\times 100,000 = \\frac{1,200}{500,000} \\times 100,000 = 240\n    $$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, this is $240.0$.\n\n2.  Injury rate per $100,000$ population:\n    $$\n    R_{i, \\text{pop}} = \\frac{N_i}{P} \\times 100,000 = \\frac{300}{500,000} \\times 100,000 = 60\n    $$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, this is $60.00$.\n\n3.  Death rate per $100,000$ population:\n    $$\n    R_{d, \\text{pop}} = \\frac{N_d}{P} \\times 100,000 = \\frac{50}{500,000} \\times 100,000 = 10\n    $$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, this is $10.00$.\n\nSecond, we compute the rates per $10^{9}$ vehicle-kilometers. The general formula is:\n$$\nR_{\\text{VKT}} = \\frac{\\text{Number of events}}{V} \\times 10^{9}\n$$\n\n4.  Crash rate per $10^{9}$ vehicle-kilometers:\n    $$\n    R_{c, \\text{VKT}} = \\frac{N_c}{V} \\times 10^{9} = \\frac{1,200}{1.5 \\times 10^{9}} \\times 10^{9} = \\frac{1,200}{1.5} = 800\n    $$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, this is $800.0$.\n\n5.  Injury rate per $10^{9}$ vehicle-kilometers:\n    $$\n    R_{i, \\text{VKT}} = \\frac{N_i}{V} \\times 10^{9} = \\frac{300}{1.5 \\times 10^{9}} \\times 10^{9} = \\frac{300}{1.5} = 200\n    $$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, this is $200.0$.\n\n6.

For example, a death rate of $10.00$ per $100,000$ population quantifies the average resident's risk of dying in a road crash over a year, regardless of how much they travel. This metric is valuable for public health planning, such as allocating emergency medical services and understanding the overall impact of injuries on society.\n\nThe exposure-based rate, using VKT as the denominator, measures the risk associated with the activity of traveling on the road network. A death rate of $33.33$ per $10^9$ VKT quantifies the risk of fatality per unit of distance traveled. This metric reflects the intrinsic safety of the transport system (i.e., the combination of road design, vehicle condition, and road user behavior).\n\nFor guiding prevention policy aimed at making travel safer (e.g., through engineering improvements, enforcement of traffic laws, or vehicle safety standards), the exposure-based rate is the superior metric. It isolates the risk of the activity from the amount of the activity. For instance, if a city's population-based crash rate increases, it could be because the roads have become more dangerous or simply because people are driving more. The VKT-based rate distinguishes these possibilities. A decreasing VKT-based rate signals that safety interventions are effective, even if an increase in total travel volume causes the absolute number of crashes to stay the same or rise. Therefore, by normalizing for exposure, the VKT-based rate provides a more precise and sensitive indicator of the effectiveness of road safety interventions and the underlying risk of the transportation system itself.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 240.0 & 60.00 & 10.00 & 800.0 & 200.0 & 33.33 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4559475"}, {"introduction": "Among the many factors contributing to road traffic injuries, speed is arguably the most critical determinant of a crash's outcome.

The request for an interpretation of the result's significance is a standard academic task that relies on established principles of injury prevention, not subjective opinion.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the fractional change, $\\Delta$, in the number of fatal crashes resulting from a reduction in mean speed. The fundamental relationship is given by the Nilsson Power Model.\n\nLet $v_0$ be the initial mean speed and $v_1$ be the final mean speed. We are given $v_0 = 50 \\text{ km/h}$ and $v_1 = 45 \\text{ km/h}$.\n\nThe Nilsson Power Model states that the number of fatal crashes, $F$, is proportional to the mean speed, $v$, raised to a power, $k$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$F(v) \\propto v^k$$\nThis proportionality can be written as an equation using a constant of proportionality, $C$:\n$$F(v) = C v^k$$\nThe constant $C$ encapsulates all other factors that influence crash frequency, such as traffic volume (exposure), road geometry, vehicle characteristics, and weather conditions. The problem states that traffic exposure is constant, and we assume all other factors are unchanged by the intervention, so $C$ is the same for both the before and after periods.\n\nThe number of fatal crashes before the intervention (at speed $v_0$) is:\n$$F(v_0) = C v_0^k$$\nThe number of fatal crashes after the intervention (at speed $v_1$) is:\n$$F(v_1) = C v_1^k$$\n\nThe fractional change, $\\Delta$, is defined as the change in the number of crashes divided by the original number of crashes. Using the problem's notation with $v_0 = 50$ and $v_1 = 45$:\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{F(v_1) - F(v_0)}{F(v_0)}$$\nSubstituting the expressions from the power model into this definition:\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{C v_1^k - C v_0^k}{C v_0^k}$$\nThe constant of proportionality, $C$, appears in all terms and can be canceled out:\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{v_1^k - v_0^k}{v_0^k} = \\frac{v_1^k}{v_0^k} - \\frac{v_0^k}{v_0^k} = \\left(\\frac{v_1}{v_0}\\right)^k - 1$$\nThis is the general formula for the fractional change in crashes based on the power model.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this derived formula:\n-   $v_0 = 50 \\text{ km/h}$\n-   $v_1 = 45 \\text{ km/h}$\n-   $k = 4$\n\nThe ratio of the speeds is:\n$$\\frac{v_1}{v_0} = \\frac{45}{50} = \\frac{9}{10} = 0.9$$\nNow, we can compute $\\Delta$:\n$$\\Delta = \\left(0.9\\right)^4 - 1$$\nCalculating the power:\n$$(0.9)^2 = 0.81$$\n$$(0.9)^4 = ((0.9)^2)^2 = (0.81)^2 = 0.6561$$\nFinally, substituting this value back into the expression for $\\Delta$:\n$$\\Delta = 0.6561 - 1 = -0.3439$$\nThe calculated fractional change is $-0.3439$. The negative sign indicates a decrease. This result already has four significant figures, as requested.\n\n### Public Health Significance\n\nThe result $\\Delta = -0.3439$ indicates an expected reduction of $34.39\\%$ in fatal crashes. The public health significance of this finding is profound. A relatively modest reduction in mean speed of $10\\%$ (from $50 \\text{ km/h}$ to $45 \\text{ km/h}$) yields a disproportionately large reduction in road traffic fatalities. This non-linear relationship is a cornerstone of modern road safety science, often associated with the \"Safe System\" approach.\n\nThe physical basis for this effect is that the kinetic energy of a moving vehicle is proportional to the square of its speed ($E_k = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$). In a collision, this energy must be dissipated, and higher energy levels lead to much greater forces on the human body, drastically increasing the probability of severe or fatal injury once human biomechanical tolerance limits are exceeded. The exponent $k=4$ is an empirical quantification of this combined effect of increased crash risk and increased injury severity at higher speeds.\n\nFrom a public health perspective, this result demonstrates that speed management is a high-leverage intervention for preventing the most serious outcomes of road traffic collisions. It provides a strong, evidence-based rationale for policies such as lower urban speed limits, automated speed enforcement, and traffic-calming road design, as these measures can produce substantial gains in public health and safety for a given level of implementation effort.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.3439}$$", "id": "4559526"}, {"introduction": "Effective injury prevention often involves promoting the use of safety devices, but how can we quantify the total benefit of such a program?
