The derivation must use fundamental definitions.\n\nLet $E$ be the event of exposure to speeding and $\\bar{E}$ be the event of non-exposure.\nLet $D$ be the outcome of interest, which is a road traffic injury.\nThe prevalence of exposure to speeding in the population of trips is given as $P_e = P(E) = 0.25$.\nThe prevalence of non-exposure is therefore $P(\\bar{E}) = 1 - P_e = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\n\nLet $I_e$ be the incidence (risk) of injury in the exposed group (those who are speeding). This is the conditional probability $P(D|E)$.\nLet $I_{\\bar{e}}$ be the incidence of injury in the unexposed group (those not speeding). This is the conditional probability $P(D|\\bar{E})$.\n\nThe Relative Risk ($RR$) is the ratio of the incidence in the exposed group to the incidence in the unexposed group.\n$$RR = \\frac{I_e}{I_{\\bar{e}}}$$\nWe are given $RR = 2.0$. This implies $I_e = RR \\cdot I_{\\bar{e}} = 2.0 \\cdot I_{\\bar{e}}$.\n\nThe total incidence of injury in the population, $I_{total}$, can be calculated using the law of total probability. It is the weighted average of the incidences in the exposed and unexposed subgroups, where the weights are the prevalences of these subgroups in the population.\n$$I_{total} = P(D) = P(D|E)P(E) + P(D|\\bar{E})P(\\bar{E})$$\nSubstituting the defined symbols:\n$$I_{total} = I_e \\cdot P_e + I_{\\bar{e}} \\cdot (1 - P_e)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $I_e$ in terms of $RR$ and $I_{\\bar{e}}$ into the equation for $I_{total}$:\n$$I_{total} = (RR \\cdot I_{\\bar{e}}) \\cdot P_e + I_{\\bar{e}} \\cdot (1 - P_e)$$\nWe can factor out $I_{\\bar{e}}$:\n$$I_{total} = I_{\\bar{e}} [RR \\cdot P_e + (1 - P_e)]$$\n\nThe Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) represents the proportion of all disease cases in the population that can be attributed to the exposure. It is defined as the fractional reduction in total incidence that would be achieved if the exposure were eliminated from the population. The \"counterfactual\" incidence in the population, if the exposure were eliminated, would be $I_{\\bar{e}}$, as everyone would then have the risk of the unexposed group.\nThe definition of PAF is:\n$$PAF = \\frac{I_{total} - (\\text{incidence if exposure is eliminated})}{I_{total}} = \\frac{I_{total} - I_{\\bar{e}}}{I_{total}}$$\nThis can also be written as $PAF = 1 - \\frac{I_{\\bar{e}}}{I_{total}}$.\n\nTo derive the expression for PAF in terms of $P_e$ and $RR$, we substitute the expression for $I_{total}$ into the PAF formula:\n$$PAF = \\frac{I_{\\bar{e}} [RR \\cdot P_e + 1 - P_e] - I_{\\bar{e}}}{I_{\\bar{e}} [RR \\cdot P_e + 1 - P_e]}$$\nThe term $I_{\\bar{e}}$ is a common factor in the numerator and denominator, so it cancels out (assuming $I_{\\bar{e}} > 0$):\n$$PAF = \\frac{[RR \\cdot P_e + 1 - P_e] - 1}{RR \\cdot P_e + 1 - P_e}$$\nSimplifying the numerator:\n$$PAF = \\frac{RR \\cdot P_e - P_e}{RR \\cdot P_e - P_e + 1}$$\nFactoring out $P_e$ in the numerator gives the final derived expression:\n$$PAF = \\frac{P_e (RR - 1)}{P_e (RR - 1) + 1}$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of PAF using the given parameters: $P_e = 0.25$ and $RR = 2.0$.\n$$PAF = \\frac{0.25 (2.0 - 1.0)}{0.25 (2.0 - 1.0) + 1.0}$$\n$$PAF = \\frac{0.25 (1.0)}{0.25 (1.0) + 1.0}$$\n$$PAF = \\frac{0.25}{0.25 + 1.0}$$\n$$PAF = \\frac{0.25}{1.25}$$\n$$PAF = \\frac{1/4}{5/4} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be a single decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$PAF = 0.2000$$\n\nFinally, we interpret this result. A PAF of $0.2000$ means that $20.00\\%$ of all road traffic injuries in this population are attributable to the risk factor of speeding. In the counterfactual scenario where speeding is completely eliminated (and assuming no other changes in behavior or risk), there would be a $20.00\\%$ reduction in the total incidence of road traffic injuries.

This method isolates the effect of the intervention by comparing the change in the outcome (injury rate) in the intervention group to the change in the outcome in a control group over the same period. This accounts for secular trends, which are changes that would have occurred even in the absence of the intervention.\n\nLet $r$ denote the injury rate per $10{,}000$ residents. We can define the given data using subscripts to represent the group (I for intervention, C for control) and the time period (pre for pre-intervention, post for post-intervention).\n\nThe provided data are:\n-   Intervention area, pre-period rate: $r_{I, pre} = 12$\n-   Intervention area, post-period rate: $r_{I, post} = 9$\n-   Control area, pre-period rate: $r_{C, pre} = 10$\n-   Control area, post-period rate: $r_{C, post} = 9$\n\nThe DID estimator, denoted as $\\delta_{DID}$, is calculated as the difference in the change over time between the two groups.\n\nFirst, we calculate the change in the injury rate over time for the intervention group.

The negative sign signifies a reduction in the injury rate. While the observed decrease in the intervention area was $3$ injuries per $10{,}000$ residents (from $12$ to $9$), the control area shows that a decrease of $1$ injury per $10{,}000$ residents would have likely occurred anyway due to secular trends. By subtracting this background trend from the observed change in the intervention area, we isolate the effect attributable solely to the intervention.

It is a valid, solvable problem in the field of quantitative risk assessment within preventive medicine.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet $P_0$ be the probability of fatality in a crash event under baseline conditions (no safety interventions). The problem defines the relative risk ($RR$) for an intervention as the ratio of the probability of fatality with the intervention to the probability of fatality without it.\n\nFor seat belts, the relative risk is given as $RR_{\\text{belt}} = 0.5$. Let $P_{\\text{belt}}$ be the probability of fatality when a seat belt is used. According to the definition:\n$$RR_{\\text{belt}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{belt}}}{P_0}$$\nThus, the probability of fatality with a seat belt is:\n$$P_{\\text{belt}} = P_0 \\times RR_{\\text{belt}}$$\n\nFor airbags, the relative risk is given as $RR_{\\text{airbag}} = 0.7$. Let $P_{\\text{airbag}}$ be the probability of fatality when an airbag is present. This gives:\n$$RR_{\\text{airbag}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{airbag}}}{P_0}$$\n$$P_{\\text{airbag}} = P_0 \\times RR_{\\text{airbag}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the combined relative risk, $RR_{\\text{combined}}$, when both seat belts and airbags are in use. Let $P_{\\text{combined}}$ be the probability of fatality in this scenario.\n$$RR_{\\text{combined}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{combined}}}{P_0}$$\n\nThe core assumption is that the effects are multiplicative due to independent causal pathways. This means that the application of the second intervention (e.g., airbag) reduces the risk that remains after the first intervention (e.g., seat belt) has been applied. The risk with a seat belt is $P_{\\text{belt}}$. The airbag's effect is to multiply this remaining risk by $RR_{\\text{airbag}}$. Therefore, the probability of fatality with both interventions is:\n$$P_{\\text{combined}} = P_{\\text{belt}} \\times RR_{\\text{airbag}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P_{\\text{belt}}$:\n$$P_{\\text{combined}} = (P_0 \\times RR_{\\text{belt}}) \\times RR_{\\text{airbag}} = P_0 \\times RR_{\\text{belt}} \\times RR_{\\text{airbag}}$$\n\nNow, we can find the combined relative risk, $RR_{\\text{combined}}$, by substituting this expression into its definition:\n$$RR_{\\text{combined}} = \\frac{P_0 \\times RR_{\\text{belt}} \\times RR_{\\text{airbag}}}{P_0} = RR_{\\text{belt}} \\times RR_{\\text{airbag}}$$\nThis equation formalizes the assumption of multiplicative effects on relative risk.\n\nUsing the given numerical values:\n$$RR_{\\text{belt}} = 0.5$$\n$$RR_{\\text{airbag}} = 0.7$$\n$$RR_{\\text{combined}} = 0.5 \\times 0.7 = 0.35$$\nThis is the first required result.\n\nNext, we must estimate the number of fatalities prevented, $D_{\\text{prevented}}$.\nLet $N_{\\text{fatal, baseline}}$ be the expected number of fatalities under baseline conditions. We are given:\n$$N_{\\text{fatal, baseline}} = 1{,}000$$\nThe expected number of fatalities when both interventions are used, $N_{\\text{fatal, combined}}$, is the baseline number of fatalities multiplied by the combined relative risk:\n$$N_{\\text{fatal, combined}} = N_{\\text{fatal, baseline}} \\times RR_{\\text{combined}}$$\n$$N_{\\text{fatal, combined}} = 1{,}000 \\times 0.35 = 350$$\nThe number of fatalities prevented, $D_{\\text{prevented}}$, is the difference between the baseline fatalities and the fatalities with the combined interventions:\n$$D_{\\text{prevented}} = N_{\\text{fatal, baseline}} - N_{\\text{fatal, combined}}$$\n$$D_{\\text{prevented}} = 1{,}000 - 350 = 650$$\nThis is the second required result.\n\nThe two results to be reported are $RR_{\\text{combined}} = 0.35$ and $D_{\\text{prevented}} = 650$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.35 & 650\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4540705"}]}
