It is scientifically grounded in the principles of biostatistics and epidemiology, is well-posed with all necessary data provided, and is stated objectively. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that an individual has clinically significant anxiety, and let $D^c$ be the event that the individual does not. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result. The problem provides the following information:\nThe prevalence of the condition is $p = P(D) = 0.15$. Consequently, the probability of not having the condition is $P(D^c) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85$.\nThe performance of the GAD-7 screen at three different thresholds is given by pairs of sensitivity ($\\text{Se}$) and specificity ($\\text{Sp}$):\nThreshold $1$: $(\\text{Se}_1, \\text{Sp}_1) = (0.95, 0.60)$\nThreshold $2$: $(\\text{Se}_2, \\text{Sp}_2) = (0.85, 0.80)$\nThreshold $3$: $(\\text{Se}_3, \\text{Sp}_3) = (0.70, 0.90)$\n\nBy definition, sensitivity is the true positive rate, $\\text{Se} = P(T^+ | D)$, and specificity is the true negative rate, $\\text{Sp} = P(T^- | D^c)$.\n\nFirst, we compute Youden's $J$ index for each threshold. The Youden's $J$ index is a summary measure of a diagnostic test's performance, defined as:\n$$J = \\text{Se} + \\text{Sp} - 1$$\nThis index represents the test's ability to discriminate between diseased and non-diseased individuals, ranging from $0$ (no discriminative power) to $1$ (perfect discrimination).\n\nFor Threshold $1$:\n$$J_1 = \\text{Se}_1 + \\text{Sp}_1 - 1 = 0.95 + 0.60 - 1 = 0.55$$\n\nFor Threshold $2$:\n$$J_2 = \\text{Se}_2 + \\text{Sp}_2 - 1 = 0.85 + 0.80 - 1 = 0.65$$\n\nFor Threshold $3$:\n$$J_3 = \\text{Se}_3 + \\text{Sp}_3 - 1 = 0.70 + 0.90 - 1 = 0.60$$\n\nComparing these values, the maximal Youden's $J$ index is $J_{max} = J_2 = 0.65$. Therefore, Threshold $2$ has the highest discriminative capacity as measured by this index.\n\nNext, we derive the expressions for Positive Predictive Value ($\\text{PPV}$) and Negative Predictive Value ($\\text{NPV}$) in terms of $\\text{Se}$, $\\text{Sp}$, and $p$.\n\nThe $\\text{PPV}$ is the probability that a person with a positive test result actually has the disease, i.e., $\\text{PPV} = P(D|T^+)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$\\text{PPV} = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D)P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test, which can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nWe identify the terms: $P(T^+|D) = \\text{Se}$, $P(D) = p$, $P(D^c) = 1-p$. The term $P(T^+|D^c)$ is the false positive rate, which is equal to $1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - \\text{Sp}$. Substituting these into the expansion for $P(T^+)$ gives:\n$$P(T^+) = (\\text{Se})(p) + (1 - \\text{Sp})(1 - p)$$\nTherefore, the expression for $\\text{PPV}$ is:\n$$\\text{PPV} = \\frac{\\text{Se} \\cdot p}{\\text{Se} \\cdot p + (1 - \\text{Sp})(1 - p)}$$\n\nThe $\\text{NPV}$ is the probability that a person with a negative test result is truly free of the disease, i.e., $\\text{NPV} = P(D^c|T^-)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$\\text{NPV} = P(D^c|T^-) = \\frac{P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test, expanded as:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c) + P(T^-|D)P(D)$$\nWe identify the terms: $P(T^-|D^c) = \\text{Sp}$, $P(D^c) = 1-p$. The term $P(T^-|D)$ is the false negative rate, which is $1 - P(T^+|D) = 1 - \\text{Se}$. Substituting these gives:\n$$P(T^-) = (\\text{Sp})(1 - p) + (1 - \\text{Se})(p)$$\nTherefore, the expression for $\\text{NPV}$ is:\n$$\\text{NPV} = \\frac{\\text{Sp} \\cdot (1-p)}{\\text{Sp} \\cdot (1-p) + (1 - \\text{Se})p}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate $\\text{PPV}$ and $\\text{NPV}$ for each threshold using $p=0.15$ and $1-p=0.85$.\n\nFor Threshold $1$ $(\\text{Se}=0.95, \\text{Sp}=0.60)$:\n$$\\text{PPV}_1 = \\frac{0.95 \\cdot 0.15}{0.95 \\cdot 0.15 + (1 - 0.60)(0.85)} = \\frac{0.1425}{0.1425 + 0.40 \\cdot 0.85} = \\frac{0.1425}{0.1425 + 0.34} = \\frac{0.1425}{0.4825} \\approx 0.2953$$\n$$\\text{NPV}_1 = \\frac{0.60 \\cdot 0.85}{0.60 \\cdot 0.85 + (1 - 0.95)(0.15)} = \\frac{0.51}{0.51 + 0.05 \\cdot 0.15} = \\frac{0.51}{0.51 + 0.0075} = \\frac{0.51}{0.5175} \\approx 0.9855$$\n\nFor Threshold $2$ $(\\text{Se}=0.85, \\text{Sp}=0.80)$:\n$$\\text{PPV}_2 = \\frac{0.85 \\cdot 0.15}{0.85 \\cdot 0.15 + (1 - 0.80)(0.85)} = \\frac{0.1275}{0.1275 + 0.20 \\cdot 0.85} = \\frac{0.1275}{0.1275 + 0.17} = \\frac{0.1275}{0.2975} \\approx 0.4286$$\n$$\\text{NPV}_2 = \\frac{0.80 \\cdot 0.85}{0.80 \\cdot 0.85 + (1 - 0.85)(0.15)} = \\frac{0.68}{0.68 + 0.15 \\cdot 0.15} = \\frac{0.68}{0.68 + 0.0225} = \\frac{0.68}{0.7025} \\approx 0.9680$$\n\nFor Threshold $3$ $(\\text{Se}=0.70, \\text{Sp}=0.90)$:\n$$\\text{PPV}_3 = \\frac{0.70 \\cdot 0.15}{0.70 \\cdot 0.15 + (1 - 0.90)(0.85)} = \\frac{0.105}{0.105 + 0.10 \\cdot 0.85} = \\frac{0.105}{0.105 + 0.085} = \\frac{0.105}{0.190} \\approx 0.5526$$\n$$\\text{NPV}_3 = \\frac{0.90 \\cdot 0.85}{0.90 \\cdot 0.85 + (1 - 0.70)(0.15)} = \\frac{0.765}{0.765 + 0.30 \\cdot 0.15} = \\frac{0.765}{0.765 + 0.045} = \\frac{0.765}{0.810} \\approx 0.9444$$\n\nSummary of results:\nThreshold $1$: $J_1=0.55$, $\\text{PPV}_1 \\approx 0.2953$, $\\text{NPV}_1 \\approx 0.9855$\nThreshold $2$: $J_2=0.65$, $\\text{PPV}_2 \\approx 0.4286$, $\\text{NPV}_2 \\approx 0.9680$\nThreshold $3$: $J_3=0.60$, $\\text{PPV}_3 \\approx 0.5526$, $\\text{NPV}_3 \\approx 0.9444$\n\nThe choice of a screening cutoff involves a trade-off.\nThreshold $1$, with the highest sensitivity ($\\text{Se}=0.95$), is best at identifying individuals with anxiety, missing only $5\\%$ of cases. This results in an extremely high $\\text{NPV}$ of approximately $0.99$. It is an excellent \"ruling-out\" test. However, its low specificity ($\\text{Sp}=0.60$) leads to a large number of false positives, yielding a very low $\\text{PPV}$ of about $0.30$.\nThreshold $3$, with the highest specificity ($\\text{Sp}=0.90$), is best at correctly identifying individuals without anxiety. This minimizes false positives, resulting in the highest $\\text{PPV}$ of about $0.55$. It is a better \"ruling-in\" test. The trade-off is its lower sensitivity ($\\text{Se}=0.70$), which means it misses $30\\%$ of true cases, leading to the lowest $\\text{NPV}$ of about $0.94$.\nThreshold $2$ offers a balance. It has the maximal Youden's $J$ index, suggesting it provides the best overall discrimination. Its $\\text{PPV}$ and $\\text{NPV}$ values are intermediate between the other two thresholds. This represents a compromise between case detection and avoiding false positives.\nThe optimal choice depends on the clinical and public health context: the consequences of a missed diagnosis (false negative) versus the costs and harms of a false-positive result (e.g., patient anxiety, unnecessary follow-up diagnostics).\n\nThe problem asks for the maximal value of $J$. This was found to be $J_2=0.65$.

Derivation of Likelihood Ratios from First Principles**\n\nThe likelihood ratios quantify how much a positive or negative test result changes the odds of having the disease.\n\n**Positive Likelihood Ratio ($LR^{+}$)**\nThe positive likelihood ratio is defined as the ratio of the probability of a positive test in a diseased individual to the probability of a positive test in a non-diseased individual.\n$$LR^{+} = \\frac{P(T^+ | D)}{P(T^+ | D^c)}$$\nWe are given the numerator, which is the sensitivity, $\\text{Se} = P(T^+ | D) = 0.88$.\nThe denominator is the false positive rate.
