The problem asks for the calculation of absolute risk reduction and the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) for a public health intervention, which are standard metrics in preventive medicine and program evaluation. All necessary parameters are provided for a unique solution.\n\nLet us define the variables based on the problem statement:\n- $R_{baseline}$: The baseline $12$-month incidence proportion (risk) of a substantiated child physical abuse case in the target population.\n- $RRR_{part}$: The relative risk reduction among families who participate in the program (engage in at least four sessions).\n- $P_{part}$: The proportion of eligible families who participate.\n- $P_{nonpart}$: The proportion of eligible families who do not participate.\n- $R_{part}$: The risk among participating families.\n- $R_{nonpart}$: The risk among non-participating families.\n- $R_{overall}$: The overall risk in the total eligible population after the program is implemented.\n- $ARR_{pop}$: The absolute risk reduction in the total eligible population.\n- $NNT$: The Number Needed to Treat.\n\nThe given values are:\n- $R_{baseline} = 0.15$\n- $RRR_{part} = 0.35$\n- $P_{part} = 0.70$\n- $P_{nonpart} = 0.30$\n\nThe solution proceeds in several steps.\n\nFirst, we calculate the risk of child physical abuse among families who participate in the program, $R_{part}$. The relative risk reduction ($RRR_{part}$) is defined as the proportional reduction in risk among the treated group compared to the baseline risk.\n$$RRR_{part} = \\frac{R_{baseline} - R_{part}}{R_{baseline}} = 1 - \\frac{R_{part}}{R_{baseline}}$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for $R_{part}$:\n$$R_{part} = R_{baseline} \\times (1 - RRR_{part})$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R_{part} = 0.15 \\times (1 - 0.35) = 0.15 \\times 0.65 = 0.0975$$\n\nSecond, we determine the risk among non-participating families, $R_{nonpart}$. The problem states that non-participants derive no benefit and there is no change in their baseline risk. Therefore, their risk remains the same as the baseline risk for the entire population.\n$$R_{nonpart} = R_{baseline} = 0.15$$\n\nThird, we calculate the expected overall risk in the total eligible population after the program is implemented, $R_{overall}$. This is the weighted average of the risks in the participant and non-participant subgroups, with the weights being the proportions of these subgroups in the total eligible population.\n$$R_{overall} = (R_{part} \\times P_{part}) + (R_{nonpart} \\times P_{nonpart})$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$R_{overall} = (0.0975 \\times 0.70) + (0.15 \\times 0.30)$$\n$$R_{overall} = 0.06825 + 0.045 = 0.11325$$\n\nFourth, we compute the expected absolute risk reduction in the eligible population, $ARR_{pop}$. This is the difference between the risk without the program ($R_{baseline}$) and the overall risk with the program ($R_{overall}$). This metric reflects the program's total impact on the population level, accounting for both its efficacy and its reach (uptake).\n$$ARR_{pop} = R_{baseline} - R_{overall}$$\n$$ARR_{pop} = 0.15 - 0.11325 = 0.03675$$\nThe expected absolute risk reduction in the eligible population is $0.03675$, or $3.675$ percentage points.\n\nFifth, we determine the Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$). The $NNT$ is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction. It represents the average number of people who must be enrolled in the program to prevent one adverse outcome (in this case, one substantiated case of child physical abuse).\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR_{pop}}$$\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.03675} \\approx 27.210884...$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final $NNT$ to four significant figures.\n$$NNT \\approx 27.21$$\n\nFinally, a brief interpretation of the $NNT$ is required.

This calculation accounts for the program's effectiveness only in the subgroup that engages and the expected rate of engagement ($70\\%$).
