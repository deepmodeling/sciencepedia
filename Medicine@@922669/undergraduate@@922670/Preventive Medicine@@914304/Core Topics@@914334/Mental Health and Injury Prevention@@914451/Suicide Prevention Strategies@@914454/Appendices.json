A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet $D$ be the event that an individual has the condition (a recent suicide attempt), and let $D^c$ be the event that the individual does not have the condition. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n- The prevalence of the condition is $P(D) = 0.01$. This implies the probability of not having the condition is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$.\n- The sensitivity of the tool is the probability of a positive test given the condition is present: $P(T^+ | D) = 0.85$. This is the true positive rate.\n- The specificity of the tool is the probability of a negative test given the condition is absent: $P(T^- | D^c) = 0.90$. This is the true negative rate.\n\nFrom these definitions, we can derive two other conditional probabilities:\n- The false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test given the condition is absent: $P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n- The false negative rate, which is the probability of a negative test given the condition is present: $P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$.\n\n**1. Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\nThe PPV is the probability that an individual has the condition given a positive test result, denoted as $P(D | T^+)$. Using Bayes' theorem, we express this as:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of receiving a positive test result. We find this using the law of total probability, summing over the two mutually exclusive scenarios (having the condition or not having it):\n$$\nP(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Bayes' theorem expression for PPV gives the full formula:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{(0.85)(0.01)}{(0.85)(0.01) + (0.10)(0.99)} = \\frac{0.0085}{0.0085 + 0.099} = \\frac{0.0085}{0.1075}\n$$\nCalculating the value and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} \\approx 0.0790697... \\approx 0.07907\n$$\n\n**2. Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\nThe NPV is the probability that an individual does not have the condition given a negative test result, denoted as $P(D^c | T^-)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$\n\\text{NPV} = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative result, found using the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the NPV expression:\n$$\n\\text{NPV} = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$$\n\\text{NPV} = \\frac{(0.90)(0.99)}{(0.90)(0.99) + (0.15)(0.01)} = \\frac{0.891}{0.891 + 0.0015} = \\frac{0.891}{0.8925}\n$$\nCalculating the value and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\text{NPV} \\approx 0.9983193... \\approx 0.9983\n$$\n\n**3. Expected Number of False Positives per $10,000$ Individuals**\nA false positive occurs when an individual tests positive ($T^+$) but does not have the condition ($D^c$). The probability of this joint event for a single randomly selected individual is $P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$. Using the definition of conditional probability, we have:\n$$\nP(T^+ \\cap D^c) = P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nP(T^+ \\cap D^c) = (0.10)(0.99) = 0.099\n$$\nThe expected number of false positives in a screened population of size $N = 10,000$ is the product of the population size and the probability of a single individual being a false positive. Let $E[FP]$ be this expectation.\n$$\nE[FP] = N \\times P(T^+ \\cap D^c) = 10,000 \\times 0.099 = 990\n$$\nThis is an exact count.\n\nThe three requested results are the numerical values for PPV, NPV, and the expected number of false positives per $10,000$ individuals.\n- PPV: $0.07907$\n- NPV: $0.9983$\n- Expected false positives per $10,000$: $990$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.07907  0.9983  990 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4580340"}, {"introduction": "Once a promising intervention is identified, how do we quantify its efficiency and plan for its implementation?

The \"Caring Contacts\" intervention is a recognized, evidence-based strategy. The scenario is scientifically sound and realistic.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides all necessary information ($ARR$) to derive and calculate the NNT. The tasks are clearly defined and lead to a unique, meaningful solution.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem statement is presented using precise, objective language common in clinical trials and public health research.\n\n**1.3. Verdict and Action:**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains no logical contradictions, missing information, or subjective claims. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Calculation\n\nLet $P_{U}$ be the probability of a suicide attempt over the $6$-month period for a patient in the \"usual care\" (control) group. This is the baseline risk.\nLet $P_{T}$ be the probability of a suicide attempt over the same period for a patient in the \"Caring Contacts\" (treated) group.\n\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$) is defined as the difference between the risk in the control group and the risk in the treated group.\n$$\nARR = P_{U} - P_{T}\n$$\nThe problem provides this value as $ARR = 0.012$. This value represents the fraction of patients who are prevented from having an event due to the treatment.\n\nThe Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is defined conceptually as the number of patients that must be treated with the intervention to prevent one additional adverse event (in this case, one suicide attempt) compared to the control group.\n\nTo derive the formula for NNT from first principles, let us consider a cohort of $N$ high-risk patients.\n\nIf this cohort of $N$ patients were to receive usual care, the expected number of suicide attempts, $E_{U}$, would be:\n$$\nE_{U} = N \\times P_{U}\n$$\n\nIf this same cohort of $N$ patients were to receive the Caring Contacts intervention, the expected number of suicide attempts, $E_{T}$, would be:\n$$\nE_{T} = N \\times P_{T}\n$$\n\nThe number of suicide attempts averted in this cohort of $N$ patients by using the intervention instead of usual care is the difference between these two expected values:\n$$\n\\text{Events Averted} = E_{U} - E_{T} = (N \\times P_{U}) - (N \\times P_{T})\n$$\nFactoring out $N$, we get:\n$$\n\\text{Events Averted} = N \\times (P_{U} - P_{T})\n$$\nWe recognize the term $(P_{U} - P_{T})$ as the Absolute Risk Reduction, $ARR$.\n$$\n\\text{Events Averted} = N \\times ARR\n$$\nThe NNT is the specific value of $N$ for which exactly one event is averted. Therefore, we set $\\text{Events Averted} = 1$ and solve for $N$, which will then be the NNT.\n$$\n1 = NNT \\times ARR\n$$\nSolving for NNT, we arrive at the general formula derived from first principles:\n$$\nNNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}\n$$\nNow, we can substitute the given value of $ARR = 0.012$ to calculate the specific NNT for the Caring Contacts program.\n$$\nNNT = \\frac{1}{0.012} = \\frac{1}{12/1000} = \\frac{1000}{12} = \\frac{250}{3} \\approx 83.333...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$\nNNT \\approx 83.3\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Discussion of Practical Implications\n\nThe calculated NNT of approximately $83.3$ means that, on average, a health system must enroll and provide the Caring Contacts intervention to $83$ high-risk patients for a $6$-month period to prevent one suicide attempt that would have otherwise occurred. This quantitative measure has several important practical implications for scaling such a program:\n\n1.  **Resource Planning (Staffing and Workload):** The NNT provides a direct link between patient volume and expected outcomes. To avert one attempt, program staff must manage the follow-up for $83$ patients. If the protocol involves, for example, $10$ brief messages per patient over $6$ months, this translates to a minimum of $830$ proactive contacts per single suicide attempt averted. This calculation is fundamental for estimating the staffing hours, communication infrastructure (e.g., text messaging platform costs), and overall operational budget required to run the program at a scale that produces a meaningful impact.\n\n2.  **Setting Program Goals and Scale:** Health system leaders can use the NNT to perform \"back-of-the-envelope\" calculations for strategic planning. If the system aims to avert, for instance, $20$ suicide attempts per year (or $10$ per $6$-month period), the necessary program size can be estimated. They would need to enroll and treat approximately $10 \\times NNT = 10 \\times 83.3 \\approx 833$ high-risk patients continuously. This figure informs the scope of patient identification efforts, the required capacity of the clinical team, and the total program cost.\n\n3.  **Efficiency and Prioritization:** The NNT serves as a standardized metric of clinical efficiency that allows for comparison across different interventions. When considering multiple potential programs for suicide prevention or other health outcomes, administrators can compare their respective NNTs (and associated costs) to make data-driven decisions on resource allocation. An intervention with a lower NNT is more efficient on a per-patient basis, though cost and feasibility must also be considered.\n\n4.  **Managing Expectations:** The NNT underscores a crucial reality of preventive medicine: the benefits are realized at a population level. For every $83$ patients treated, only one will have an attempt averted due to the intervention. The other $82$ patients either would not have made an attempt anyway or will still make an attempt despite the intervention. This concept is vital for communicating the program's value to stakeholders, funders, and even clinicians, who might otherwise become discouraged by not seeing dramatic results in every patient they treat.
