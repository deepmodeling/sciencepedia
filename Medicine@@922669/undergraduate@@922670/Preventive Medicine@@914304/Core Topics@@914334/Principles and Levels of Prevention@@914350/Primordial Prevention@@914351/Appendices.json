This principle explains why a preventive measure that brings a small benefit to each individual in a large population may ultimately prevent more cases of disease than a measure that offers a large benefit only to a few high-risk individuals. This exercise [@problem_id:4562237] provides a concrete numerical scenario to help you grasp this foundational idea, comparing a population-wide policy on alcohol availability to a targeted clinical program for heavy drinkers.", "problem": "A city of $100{,}000$ adults is considering two approaches to reduce alcohol-attributable injuries. For the purpose of this problem, use the following foundational definitions. Primordial prevention acts on upstream social and environmental determinants to prevent the emergence of risk factors in populations. The prevention paradox states that a strategy that brings small benefits to each individual but is applied to a large population may prevent more cases overall than strategies targeting only high-risk individuals. Risk is the probability of an outcome over a specified time period, and expected cases in a subgroup equal the product of subgroup size and risk. Relative Risk Reduction (RRR) is the proportional decrease in risk due to an intervention.\n\nBaseline distribution of drinking patterns and annual alcohol-attributable injury risks are as follows: abstainers constitute $20\\%$ of adults with risk $0$ per $1{,}000$ per year; moderate drinkers constitute $70\\%$ with risk $4$ per $1{,}000$ per year; heavy drinkers constitute $10\\%$ with risk $40$ per $1{,}000$ per year.\n\nTwo interventions are considered:\n- Population policy (primordial prevention): reducing alcohol outlet density and marketing. Empirical experience suggests a $10\\%$ RRR in annual alcohol-attributable injury risk among all drinkers (both moderate and heavy). In addition, the prevalence of heavy drinking falls from $10\\%$ to $8\\%$, with the $2\\%$ shifting into the moderate category. Assume risks after the policy are reduced by the $10\\%$ RRR within their respective post-policy categories.\n- High-risk clinical program: intensive treatment offered to heavy drinkers only, with $50\\%$ coverage of heavy drinkers and a $40\\%$ RRR among those treated. Assume no spillover effects to moderate drinkers.\n\nWhich option best states the prevention paradox and correctly computes the expected annual number of alcohol-attributable injuries averted by the population policy versus the high-risk program?\n\nA. The prevention paradox holds that a population-wide shift in exposure can avert more total cases than targeting only high-risk individuals, even if the individual benefit is small; here, the population policy averts about $133$ injuries per year, whereas the high-risk program averts about $80$.\n\nB. The prevention paradox holds that targeted high-risk interventions invariably avert more cases because they focus on those at highest risk; here, the high-risk program averts about $160$ injuries per year, exceeding the population policy’s $133$.\n\nC. The prevention paradox holds that population strategies deliver larger individual benefits than targeted approaches; here, the population policy averts about $80$ injuries per year, whereas the high-risk program averts about $133$.\n\nD. The prevention paradox highlights that population-wide strategies typically prevent fewer cases but are cheaper; here, both approaches avert about $133$ injuries per year, demonstrating equivalence in effect size but different mechanisms.", "solution": "The problem asks to evaluate two public health interventions, compute the number of injuries averted by each, and relate the findings to the prevention paradox. The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains all necessary information for a quantitative solution.\n\n**1. Baseline Calculation of Expected Annual Injuries**\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of expected alcohol-attributable injuries per year in the baseline scenario. The total adult population is $N = 100,000$.\n\nThe population is divided into three groups:\n-   **Abstainers**:\n    -   Population size: $N_A = 0.20 \\times 100,000 = 20,000$.\n    -   Risk: $R_A = 0$ per $1,000$ per year, which is a risk of $0$.\n    -   Expected cases: $E_A = N_A \\times R_A = 20,000 \\times 0 = 0$.\n\n-   **Moderate Drinkers**:\n    -   Population size: $N_M = 0.70 \\times 100,000 = 70,000$.\n    -   Risk: $R_M = 4$ per $1,000$ per year, which is a risk of $0.004$.\n    -   Expected cases: $E_M = N_M \\times R_M = 70,000 \\times 0.004 = 280$.\n\n-   **Heavy Drinkers**:\n    -   Population size: $N_H = 0.10 \\times 100,000 = 10,000$.\n    -   Risk: $R_H = 40$ per $1,000$ per year, which is a risk of $0.04$.\n    -   Expected cases: $E_H = N_H \\times R_H = 10,000 \\times 0.04 = 400$.\n\nThe total number of expected injuries at baseline is the sum of cases from all groups:\n$$E_{baseline} = E_A + E_M + E_H = 0 + 280 + 400 = 680 \\text{ injuries per year.}$$\n\nAn important observation from the baseline data is that although heavy drinkers have a much higher individual risk ($10$ times that of moderate drinkers), the larger population of moderate drinkers contributes a substantial number of cases ($280$ cases, compared to $400$ from heavy drinkers). This is a key feature related to the prevention paradox.\n\n**2. Intervention 1: Population Policy (Primordial Prevention)**\n\nThis intervention has two effects: a shift in the drinking population distribution and a reduction in risk for all drinkers.\n\n-   **New Population Distribution**:\n    -   The prevalence of heavy drinking falls from $10\\%$ to $8\\%$. The new number of heavy drinkers is $N'_{H} = 0.08 \\times 100,000 = 8,000$.\n    -   The $2\\%$ of the population that ceases heavy drinking shifts to the moderate category. The prevalence of moderate drinking increases from $70\\%$ to $72\\%$. The new number of moderate drinkers is $N'_{M} = 0.72 \\times 100,000 = 72,000$.\n    -   Abstainers remain at $20\\%$, so $N'_{A} = 20,000$.\n\n-   **New Risks**:\n    -   A Relative Risk Reduction (RRR) of $10\\%$ ($0.10$) applies to all drinkers.\n    -   New risk for moderate drinkers: $R'_{M} = R_M \\times (1 - RRR) = 0.004 \\times (1 - 0.10) = 0.004 \\times 0.9 = 0.0036$.\n    -   New risk for heavy drinkers: $R'_{H} = R_H \\times (1 - RRR) = 0.04 \\times (1 - 0.10) = 0.04 \\times 0.9 = 0.036$.\n\n-   **New Expected Cases**:\n    -   Cases from moderate drinkers: $E'_{M} = N'_{M} \\times R'_{M} = 72,000 \\times 0.0036 = 259.2$.\n    -   Cases from heavy drinkers: $E'_{H} = N'_{H} \\times R'_{H} = 8,000 \\times 0.036 = 288$.\n    -   Total expected cases after the policy: $E_{policy} = E'_{M} + E'_{H} + E'_{A} = 259.2 + 288 + 0 = 547.2$.\n\n-   **Averted Injuries**:\n    -   The number of averted injuries is the difference between baseline cases and post-intervention cases.\n    $$A_{policy} = E_{baseline} - E_{policy} = 680 - 547.2 = 132.8 \\text{ injuries per year.}$$\n\n**3. Intervention 2: High-Risk Clinical Program**\n\nThis intervention targets only heavy drinkers.\n\n-   **Target Population**:\n    -   The program is offered to heavy drinkers, with a population of $N_H = 10,000$.\n    -   Coverage is $50\\%$. The number of treated heavy drinkers is $N_{H, treated} = 0.50 \\times 10,000 = 5,000$.\n    -   The remaining $5,000$ heavy drinkers are untreated.\n    -   The populations of moderate drinkers and abstainers are unaffected.\n\n-   **Risk Reduction**:\n    -   A RRR of $40\\%$ ($0.40$) applies only to the treated heavy drinkers.\n    -   Risk for treated heavy drinkers: $R_{H, treated} = R_H \\times (1 - RRR) = 0.04 \\times (1 - 0.40) = 0.04 \\times 0.6 = 0.024$.\n\n-   **Averted Injuries**:\n    -   We can calculate the averted injuries directly by focusing only on the group that receives the intervention. The reduction in cases occurs solely among the $5,000$ treated individuals.\n    -   Baseline cases in this subgroup: $5,000 \\times R_H = 5,000 \\times 0.04 = 200$.\n    -   Post-intervention cases in this subgroup: $5,000 \\times R_{H, treated} = 5,000 \\times 0.024 = 120$.\n    -   Averted injuries = $200 - 120 = 80$.\n    -   Alternatively, using the RRR directly on the treated subgroup:\n    $$A_{high-risk} = (\\text{Number treated}) \\times (\\text{Baseline risk}) \\times RRR$$\n    $$A_{high-risk} = 5,000 \\times 0.04 \\times 0.40 = 200 \\times 0.40 = 80 \\text{ injuries per year.}$$\n\n**4. Evaluation of Options**\n\n-   **Population policy averts approximately $133$ injuries.**\n-   **High-risk program averts $80$ injuries.**\n\nThe population policy averts more cases in total ($132.8 > 80$), despite the smaller RRR ($10\\%$) for each individual compared to the high-risk program's RRR ($40\\%$). This occurs because the population policy affects a much larger group (all $82,000$ drinkers, including the large moderate-risk group) and also shifts people out of the highest-risk category. This outcome exemplifies the prevention paradox.\n\nNow we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. The prevention paradox holds that a population-wide shift in exposure can avert more total cases than targeting only high-risk individuals, even if the individual benefit is small; here, the population policy averts about $133$ injuries per year, whereas the high-risk program averts about $80$.**\n-   **Statement of Paradox**: The description is accurate.\n-   **Calculation**: The stated averted cases ($133$ for population policy, $80$ for high-risk program) match our calculations ($132.8$ and $80$).\n-   **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**B. The prevention paradox holds that targeted high-risk interventions invariably avert more cases because they focus on those at highest risk; here, the high-risk program averts about $160$ injuries per year, exceeding the population policy’s $133$.**\n-   **Statement of Paradox**: This is the opposite of the prevention paradox. The paradox arises when the population strategy is more effective in aggregate.\n-   **Calculation**: The averted cases for the high-risk program are stated as $160$, which is incorrect. Our calculation is $80$. The value $160$ would result from incorrectly assuming $100\\%$ coverage of heavy drinkers ($10,000 \\times 0.04 \\times 0.40 = 160$).\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**C. The prevention paradox holds that population strategies deliver larger individual benefits than targeted approaches; here, the population policy averts about $80$ injuries per year, whereas the high-risk program averts about $133$.**\n-   **Statement of Paradox**: This is incorrect. The paradox is characterized by small individual benefits in the population strategy accumulating to a large total effect. The individual benefit (RRR) is smaller in the population strategy ($10\\%$) than in the high-risk one ($40\\%$).\n-   **Calculation**: The numbers for averted cases ($80$ for population, $133$ for high-risk) are swapped and contradict our findings.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. The prevention paradox highlights that population-wide strategies typically prevent fewer cases but are cheaper; here, both approaches avert about $133$ injuries per year, demonstrating equivalence in effect size but different mechanisms.**\n-   **Statement of Paradox**: This is incorrect. The paradox is about preventing *more* cases with a population strategy, not fewer. While cost is a relevant factor in public health, it is not the core of the paradox itself.\n-   **Calculation**: The claim of equivalence ($133$ averted cases for both) is false. The high-risk program averts $80$ cases, not $133$.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, only option A correctly defines the prevention paradox and provides the correct calculated outcomes for both interventions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4562237"}, {"introduction": "After understanding *why* population-wide strategies are so powerful, the next logical question is *how* we measure their impact.
