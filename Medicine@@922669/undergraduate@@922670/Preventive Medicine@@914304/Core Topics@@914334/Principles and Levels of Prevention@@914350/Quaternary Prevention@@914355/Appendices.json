Building on the principle of balancing benefits and harms, this advanced exercise shows how to tailor interventions based on an individual's baseline risk.

The probability of a serious adverse effect attributable to the medication within $5$ years is $q = 0.008$. The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) loss per adverse health event is $w_{b} = 0.18$, and the QALY loss per serious adverse effect is $w_{h} = 0.06$.

The threshold baseline risk, $p^{*}$, is the risk level at which the expected benefit exactly equals the expected harm. The benefit and harm are quantified in terms of Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs).\n\nLet $p$ be the baseline risk of the adverse health event for an untreated individual over the $5$-year horizon.\n\nThe probability of the event for a treated individual is $p_{treat} = p \\times (1 - r)$, where $r$ is the constant relative risk reduction.\n\nThe **Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)** is the difference in event rates between the untreated and treated populations. It represents the probability that a single treated individual is prevented from having the adverse event.\n$$\nARR(p) = p - p_{treat} = p - p(1 - r) = p \\times r\n$$\n\nThe **expected benefit** ($E_{benefit}$) per treated individual is the ARR multiplied by the QALY loss associated with the adverse health event, $w_b$. This product represents the expected QALYs gained by treating one person.\n$$\nE_{benefit}(p) = ARR(p) \\times w_{b} = (p \\times r) \\times w_{b}\n$$\n\nThe **expected harm** ($E_{harm}$) per treated individual is the probability of a serious adverse effect from the medication, $q$, multiplied by the QALY loss associated with that effect, $w_h$. This product represents the expected QALYs lost by treating one person.\n$$\nE_{harm} = q \\times w_{h}\n$$\nThe expected harm is assumed to be constant and independent of the patient's baseline risk $p$.\n\nThe threshold baseline risk, $p^{*}$, is the value of $p$ for which the expected benefit equals the expected harm.\n$$\nE_{benefit}(p^{*}) = E_{harm}\n$$\n$$\n(p^{*} \\times r) \\times w_{b} = q \\times w_{h}\n$$\nSolving this equation for $p^{*}$ yields the analytic expression for the threshold risk:\n$$\np^{*} = \\frac{q \\times w_{h}}{r \\times w_{b}}\n$$\nFor any individual with baseline risk $p > p^{*}$, the expected benefit exceeds the expected harm, and treatment is justified. For an individual with $p < p^{*}$, the expected harm exceeds the benefit, and treatment would constitute overmedicalization.\n\n### Calculation of $p^{*}$\nSubstituting the given numerical values into the derived formula:\n$$\np^{*} = \\frac{(0.008) \\times (0.06)}{(0.25) \\times (0.18)} = \\frac{0.00048}{0.045} = 0.010666...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the threshold baseline risk is:\n$$\np^{*} \\approx 0.01067\n$$\n\n### Stratum-Specific Analysis and Recommendations\nWe must now evaluate each risk stratum relative to this threshold and analyze the corresponding Number Needed to Treat (NNT) and Number Needed to Harm (NNH).\n\nThe **Number Needed to Treat (NNT)** is the average number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one additional adverse health event. It is the reciprocal of the ARR and is dependent on baseline risk.\n$$\nNNT(p) = \\frac{1}{ARR(p)} = \\frac{1}{p \\times r}\n$$\n\nThe **Number Needed to Harm (NNH)** is the average number of patients who need to be treated for one to experience a serious adverse effect. It is the reciprocal of the probability of harm, $q$.\n$$\nNNH = \\frac{1}{q} = \\frac{1}{0.008} = 125\n$$\nThe NNH is constant for all strata.\n\n**Low-Risk Stratum ($p_{L} = 0.04$):**\n-   Comparison to threshold: $p_{L} = 0.04 > p^{*} \\approx 0.01067$.

For this group, one adverse health event is prevented for every $100$ people treated, while one serious adverse effect is caused for every $125$ people treated. The QALY-weighted benefit-to-harm ratio is $\\frac{(0.04 \\times 0.25) \\times 0.18}{0.008 \\times 0.06} = 3.75$, confirming a net benefit.\n\n**Medium-Risk Stratum ($p_{M} = 0.10$):**\n-   Comparison to threshold: $p_{M} = 0.10 > p^{*} \\approx 0.01067$. The expected benefit strongly outweighs the expected harm.\n-   $NNT_{M} = \\frac{1}{p_{M} \\times r} = \\frac{1}{0.10 \\times 0.25} = \\frac{1}{0.025} = 40$.\n-   Recommendation: **Offer medication**. For this group, one adverse health event is prevented for every $40$ people treated, versus one harm event per $125$ treated. The benefit is more pronounced. The QALY-weighted benefit-to-harm ratio is $9.375$.\n\n**High-Risk Stratum ($p_{H} = 0.22$):**\n-   Comparison to threshold: $p_{H} = 0.22 > p^{*} \\approx 0.01067$. The expected benefit very strongly outweighs the expected harm.\n-   $NNT_{H} = \\frac{1}{p_{H} \\times r} = \\frac{1}{0.22 \\times 0.25} = \\frac{1}{0.055} \\approx 18.18$.\n-   Recommendation: **Strongly recommend medication**. For this group, the medication is highly efficient. One adverse health event is prevented for approximately every $18$ people treated, while the risk of harm remains one in $125$. The QALY-weighted benefit-to-harm ratio is $20.625$.\n\nIn summary, the calculated threshold $p^{*} \\approx 0.01067$ indicates that the medication provides a net QALY benefit for any individual whose $5$-year baseline risk of the adverse event is greater than approximately $1.07\\%$. Since all three defined strata ($4\\%$, $10\\%$, and $22\\%$ risk) have baseline risks well above this threshold, offering the medication is consistent with the principles of quaternary prevention for all three groups. The efficiency of the treatment, as measured by NNT, increases substantially with higher baseline risk.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.01067}$$", "id": "4566840"}]}
