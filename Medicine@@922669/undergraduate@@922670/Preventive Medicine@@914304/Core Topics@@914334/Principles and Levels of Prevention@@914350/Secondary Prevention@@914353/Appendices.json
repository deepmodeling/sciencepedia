Derivation of Symbolic Expressions**\n\nWe are asked to derive expressions for the positive predictive value ($\\mathrm{PPV}$), negative predictive value ($\\mathrm{NPV}$), and the positive likelihood ratio ($LR^{+}$).\n\n**Positive Predictive Value ($\\mathrm{PPV}$)**\nThe $\\mathrm{PPV}$ is the probability that an individual has the disease given a positive test result, which is $P(D | T^+)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PPV} = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test. By the law of total probability, we can express it as:\n$$\nP(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)\n$$\nSubstituting the symbolic parameters:\n$$\nP(T^+) = (Se)(\\pi) + (1 - Sp)(1 - \\pi)\n$$\nTherefore, the symbolic expression for $\\mathrm{PPV}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PPV} = \\frac{Se \\cdot \\pi}{Se \\cdot \\pi + (1 - Sp)(1 - \\pi)}\n$$\n\n**Negative Predictive Value ($\\mathrm{NPV}$)**\nThe $\\mathrm{NPV}$ is the probability that an individual does not have the disease given a negative test result, which is $P(D^c | T^-)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$\n\\mathrm{NPV} = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the overall probability of a negative test.

Interpretation in Context**\n\n-   **$\\mathrm{PPV} = 0.2687$**: The positive predictive value indicates that for an asymptomatic individual in this population who receives a positive screening test result, the probability that they actually have colorectal cancer is approximately $26.87\\%$. This relatively low $\\mathrm{PPV}$ is common in screening for diseases with low prevalence and underscores that a positive screening result is not a diagnosis but an indication for further, more definitive diagnostic testing (such as a colonoscopy).\n\n-   **$\\mathrm{NPV} = 0.9979$**: The negative predictive value indicates that for an asymptomatic individual who receives a negative screening test result, the probability that they are truly free of colorectal cancer is $99.79\\%$. This very high $\\mathrm{NPV}$ is a crucial feature of a good screening test, as it provides strong reassurance and effectively rules out the disease in test-negative individuals, fulfilling a primary goal of secondary prevention.\n\n-   **$LR^{+} = 18.00$**: The positive likelihood ratio shows that a positive test result is $18$ times more likely to come from an individual with colorectal cancer than from an individual without the disease. This value quantifies the test's power to increase the certainty of disease, independent of the disease prevalence. A large $LR^{+}$ (typically $10$) indicates that the test provides strong evidence to rule in the disease, significantly shifting the probability from the pre-test (prevalence) to the post-test probability ($\\mathrm{PPV}$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.2687  0.9979  18.00\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4573462"}, {"introduction": "Implementing a secondary prevention program often involves difficult decisions about the screening test's parameters.
