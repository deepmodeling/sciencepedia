{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "One of the most important lessons in preventive medicine is that an intervention with a very low individual risk is not necessarily harmless when applied at a population scale. This exercise introduces the critical concept of iatrogenic harm, where the medical intervention itself is the source of adverse outcomes. By applying fundamental principles of probability, you will calculate how a tiny per-person risk can accumulate into a substantial public health burden when a strategy is rolled out to millions, a key consideration when evaluating the trade-offs of population-wide programs [@problem_id:4556560].", "problem": "A national preventive medicine program is considering two strategies for a prophylactic intervention known to have a small probability of causing harm. First, define iatrogenic harm as used in preventive medicine. Then, consider the following scientifically plausible scenario to reason from first principles about risk accumulation across a population: Each treated individual has an independent probability $p = 2.5 \\times 10^{-6}$ of experiencing a serious adverse reaction due solely to the intervention (that is, an iatrogenic harm). Under a population-based strategy, all eligible adults are offered the intervention, totaling $N_{\\mathrm{pop}} = 4.8 \\times 10^{7}$ individuals. Under a high-risk strategy, only those with a specified pre-existing condition are treated, totaling $N_{\\mathrm{high}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{6}$ individuals. Assume the probability $p$ is constant across individuals and independent between individuals. Using only fundamental definitions of probability and expectation, derive the expected total number of serious iatrogenic events for each strategy from first principles, and then compute the expected incremental number of serious iatrogenic events attributable to implementing the population-based strategy instead of the high-risk strategy. Express the final expected incremental number as a real number with no units and round to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It presents a realistic scenario in preventive medicine and public health that can be rigorously analyzed using fundamental principles of probability theory. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe problem requires a definition of iatrogenic harm, a derivation of the expected number of adverse events from first principles, and a calculation of the incremental risk between two public health strategies.\n\nFirst, iatrogenic harm in preventive medicine refers to adverse health outcomes, injury, or complications that are caused by the preventive intervention itself, rather than by the disease or condition it is intended to prevent. The term originates from the Greek words *iatros* (healer) and *genesis* (origin). Examples include allergic reactions to vaccines, psychological distress from false-positive screening results, or, as in this problem, serious adverse reactions to a prophylactic medication.\n\nTo derive the expected total number of iatrogenic events from first principles, we model the outcome for each individual. Let $X_i$ be a random variable representing the outcome for the $i$-th individual who receives the intervention. We define $X_i = 1$ if the individual experiences a serious adverse reaction, and $X_i = 0$ otherwise. This is a Bernoulli trial.\n\nThe probability of an adverse reaction for any given individual is given as $p$. Therefore, the probability distribution for $X_i$ is:\n$P(X_i = 1) = p$\n$P(X_i = 0) = 1 - p$\n\nThe expected value of the random variable $X_i$ is, by definition for a discrete random variable:\n$$E[X_i] = \\sum_{x} x \\cdot P(X_i = x) = (1 \\cdot P(X_i = 1)) + (0 \\cdot P(X_i = 0))$$\n$$E[X_i] = (1 \\cdot p) + (0 \\cdot (1-p)) = p$$\n\nThe total number of iatrogenic events, $S_N$, in a population of size $N$ is the sum of the outcomes for all individuals in that population:\n$$S_N = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$$\nThe problem asks for the expected total number of events, which is the expected value of $S_N$. A fundamental property of expectation is its linearity, which states that the expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expectations. This property holds regardless of whether the variables are independent.\n$$E[S_N] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]$$\nSince the probability $p$ is constant for all individuals, $E[X_i] = p$ for all $i$ from $1$ to $N$. Thus, the sum becomes:\n$$E[S_N] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p = N \\cdot p$$\nThis formula, derived from first principles, allows us to calculate the expected number of events for each strategy.\n\nFor the population-based strategy, the number of treated individuals is $N_{\\mathrm{pop}} = 4.8 \\times 10^7$, and the probability of an event per individual is $p = 2.5 \\times 10^{-6}$. The expected number of iatrogenic events, $E_{\\mathrm{pop}}$, is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{pop}} = N_{\\mathrm{pop}} \\cdot p = (4.8 \\times 10^7) \\cdot (2.5 \\times 10^{-6})$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{pop}} = (4.8 \\cdot 2.5) \\times 10^{7-6} = 12.0 \\times 10^1 = 120$$\n\nFor the high-risk strategy, the number of treated individuals is $N_{\\mathrm{high}} = 3.0 \\times 10^6$, with the same probability $p = 2.5 \\times 10^{-6}$. The expected number of iatrogenic events, $E_{\\mathrm{high}}$, is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{high}} = N_{\\mathrm{high}} \\cdot p = (3.0 \\times 10^6) \\cdot (2.5 \\times 10^{-6})$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{high}} = (3.0 \\cdot 2.5) \\times 10^{6-6} = 7.5 \\times 10^0 = 7.5$$\n\nThe expected incremental number of serious iatrogenic events, $\\Delta E$, attributable to implementing the population-based strategy instead of the high-risk strategy is the difference between their respective expected values:\n$$\\Delta E = E_{\\mathrm{pop}} - E_{\\mathrm{high}}$$\n$$\\Delta E = 120 - 7.5 = 112.5$$\nAlternatively, this can be calculated as:\n$$\\Delta E = (N_{\\mathrm{pop}} - N_{\\mathrm{high}}) \\cdot p = (4.8 \\times 10^7 - 3.0 \\times 10^6) \\cdot (2.5 \\times 10^{-6})$$\n$$\\Delta E = (48.0 \\times 10^6 - 3.0 \\times 10^6) \\cdot (2.5 \\times 10^{-6})$$\n$$\\Delta E = (45.0 \\times 10^6) \\cdot (2.5 \\times 10^{-6})$$\n$$\\Delta E = (45.0 \\cdot 2.5) \\times 10^{6-6} = 112.5$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard scenario in quantitative public health policy analysis. We can proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is partitioned into three parts, corresponding to the three tasks requested in the problem statement.\n\n### Part 1: Net Effect of the Targeted Strategy\n\nThe targeted strategy involves applying an intensive intervention only to individuals who test positive on a risk classification test. The net effect is the number of disease events prevented minus the number of serious harms caused.\n\nLet $H$ denote the event that an individual is truly high-risk and $L$ the event that they are truly low-risk. Let $T+$ denote a positive test result. The probabilities of these states are given as $P(H) = \\pi$ and $P(L) = 1 - \\pi$.\nThe test's characteristics are given by its sensitivity, $\\text{Se} = P(T+\\,|\\,H)$, and specificity, $\\text{Sp} = P(T-\\,|\\,L)$, where $T-$ is a negative test result. This implies $P(T+\\,|\\,L) = 1 - \\text{Sp}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of individuals who are treated. The intervention is given to all who test positive. The number of individuals testing positive is the sum of true positives (high-risk individuals testing positive) and false positives (low-risk individuals testing positive).\n- Number of truly high-risk individuals: $N \\pi$.\n- Number of truly low-risk individuals: $N(1-\\pi)$.\n- Number of true positives ($N_{TP}$): High-risk individuals who test positive. $N_{TP} = (N\\pi) \\times \\text{Se}$.\n- Number of false positives ($N_{FP}$): Low-risk individuals who test positive. $N_{FP} = N(1-\\pi) \\times (1-\\text{Sp})$.\n\nThe total number of individuals treated under the targeted strategy, $N_{\\text{treated}}$, is:\n$$N_{\\text{treated}} = N_{TP} + N_{FP} = N\\pi\\text{Se} + N(1-\\pi)(1-\\text{Sp}) = N[\\pi\\text{Se} + (1-\\pi)(1-\\text{Sp})]$$\n\nNext, we calculate the expected number of events prevented. The intervention reduces incidence by a proportion $r$ for truly high-risk individuals and has no benefit for low-risk individuals. Therefore, events are only prevented among the true positives.\nThe expected number of events prevented, $E_{\\text{prevented, targeted}}$, is:\n$$E_{\\text{prevented, targeted}} = N_{TP} \\times I_H \\times r = (N\\pi\\text{Se})I_H r$$\n\nNext, we calculate the expected number of serious harms caused. Harms occur at a rate $h$ for every person treated, regardless of risk status.\nThe expected number of harms, $H_{\\text{harms, targeted}}$, is:\n$$H_{\\text{harms, targeted}} = N_{\\text{treated}} \\times h = N[\\pi\\text{Se} + (1-\\pi)(1-\\text{Sp})]h$$\n\nThe net effect of the targeted strategy, $E_{\\text{net, targeted}}$, is the difference between events prevented and harms caused.\n$$E_{\\text{net, targeted}} = E_{\\text{prevented, targeted}} - H_{\\text{harms, targeted}}$$\n$$E_{\\text{net, targeted}} = N\\pi\\text{Se}rI_H - N[\\pi\\text{Se} + (1-\\pi)(1-\\text{Sp})]h$$\nFactoring out $N$, the expression for the expected net number of events is:\n$$E_{\\text{net, targeted}} = N\\left( \\pi\\text{Se}rI_H - \\left[\\pi\\text{Se} + (1-\\pi)(1-\\text{Sp})\\right]h \\right)$$\n\n### Part 2: Net Effect of the Universal Policy\n\nThe universal policy involves applying a low-intensity intervention to the entire population of size $N$. This intervention reduces incidence by a uniform proportion $b$ for all individuals and has a harm rate of $s$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the expected number of events prevented. The benefit applies to both high-risk and low-risk individuals.\n- Events prevented in the high-risk group: $(N\\pi) \\times I_H \\times b$.\n- Events prevented in the low-risk group: $N(1-\\pi) \\times I_L \\times b$.\n\nThe total expected number of events prevented, $E_{\\text{prevented, universal}}$, is the sum of these:\n$$E_{\\text{prevented, universal}} = N\\pi b I_H + N(1-\\pi)b I_L = Nb[\\pi I_H + (1-\\pi)I_L]$$\nThe term $\\pi I_H + (1-\\pi)I_L$ represents the average baseline incidence in the population.\n\nNext, we calculate the expected number of serious harms. The harm rate $s$ applies to the entire population $N$.\nThe expected number of harms, $H_{\\text{harms, universal}}$, is:\n$$H_{\\text{harms, universal}} = Ns$$\n\nThe net effect of the universal policy, $E_{\\text{net, universal}}$, is:\n$$E_{\\text{net, universal}} = E_{\\text{prevented, universal}} - H_{\\text{harms, universal}}$$\n$$E_{\\text{net, universal}} = Nb[\\pi I_H + (1-\\pi)I_L] - Ns$$\nFactoring out $N$, the expression is:\n$$E_{\\text{net, universal}} = N\\left( b[\\pi I_H + (1-\\pi)I_L] - s \\right)$$\n\n### Part 3: Numerical Calculation of the Net Advantage\n\nThe net advantage of the targeted strategy over the universal policy is the difference in their net effects, $\\Delta E = E_{\\text{net, targeted}} - E_{\\text{net, universal}}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the numerical value for $E_{\\text{net, targeted}}$ using the given parameters:\n$N = 100000$, $\\pi = 0.15$, $I_H = 0.02$, $I_L = 0.002$, $\\text{Se} = 0.80$, $\\text{Sp} = 0.90$, $r = 0.50$, $h = 0.001$.\n\nEvents prevented (Targeted):\n$$E_{\\text{prevented, targeted}} = 100000 \\times 0.15 \\times 0.80 \\times 0.50 \\times 0.02 = 100000 \\times 0.0012 = 120$$\nHarms caused (Targeted):\nThe proportion of the population treated is $\\pi\\text{Se} + (1-\\pi)(1-\\text{Sp}) = (0.15)(0.80) + (1-0.15)(1-0.90) = 0.12 + (0.85)(0.10) = 0.12 + 0.085 = 0.205$.\nTotal people treated is $100000 \\times 0.205 = 20500$.\n$$H_{\\text{harms, targeted}} = 20500 \\times 0.001 = 20.5$$\nNet effect (Targeted):\n$$E_{\\text{net, targeted}} = 120 - 20.5 = 99.5$$\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for $E_{\\text{net, universal}}$:\n$N = 100000$, $\\pi = 0.15$, $I_H = 0.02$, $I_L = 0.002$, $b = 0.05$, $s = 0$.\n\nEvents prevented (Universal):\nThe average baseline incidence is $\\pi I_H + (1-\\pi)I_L = (0.15)(0.02) + (0.85)(0.002) = 0.003 + 0.0017 = 0.0047$.\n$$E_{\\text{prevented, universal}} = 100000 \\times 0.05 \\times 0.0047 = 100000 \\times 0.000235 = 23.5$$\nHarms caused (Universal):\n$$H_{\\text{harms, universal}} = 100000 \\times 0 = 0$$\nNet effect (Universal):\n$$E_{\\text{net, universal}} = 23.5 - 0 = 23.5$$\n\nFinally, we compute the net advantage of the targeted strategy:\n$$\\Delta E = E_{\\text{net, targeted}} - E_{\\text{net, universal}} = 99.5 - 23.5 = 76$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The exact value $76$ is expressed as $76.0$ to meet this requirement.\nThe net advantage of the targeted strategy over the universal policy is an expected $76.0$ net events prevented per $100000$ persons per year.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{76.0}$$", "id": "4556632"}, {"introduction": "Public health decisions are rarely about effectiveness alone; they almost always involve balancing costs against benefits under a finite budget.
