The concepts of cumulative incidence, cohort study, relative risk, and risk difference are standard, well-defined measures. The given incidence values are plausible for a common cancer over a decade.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data to calculate the two requested epidemiological measures. The definitions are standard, and a unique solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise and objective, describing a typical epidemiological scenario without bias or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nLet $I_e$ be the cumulative incidence, or risk, of the cancer in the exposed group, and let $I_u$ be the cumulative incidence in the unexposed group. The problem provides the following values for a $10$-year follow-up period:\n$$I_e = 0.08$$\n$$I_u = 0.04$$\n\nThe Relative Risk ($RR$) is a measure of the strength of association between the exposure and the outcome. It is defined as the ratio of the incidence in the exposed group to the incidence in the unexposed group.\n$$RR = \\frac{I_e}{I_u}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$RR = \\frac{0.08}{0.04} = 2$$\nAs per the problem's instruction to round to three significant figures, the value is $2.00$.\n\nThe Risk Difference ($RD$), also known as the Attributable Risk among the exposed, is a measure of the absolute effect of the exposure on the outcome. It represents the excess risk in the exposed group compared to the unexposed group. It is defined as the difference in incidence rates.\n$$RD = I_e - I_u$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$RD = 0.08 - 0.04 = 0.04$$\nAs per the problem's instruction to round to three significant figures, the value is $0.0400$.\n\n### Interpretation for Primary Prevention\n\nThe calculated effect sizes have direct implications for primary prevention.\n\n1.  **Relative Risk ($RR$)**: An $RR$ of $2.00$ indicates that individuals with the exposure are twice as likely to develop the specific cancer over the $10$-year period compared to those without the exposure. This signifies a moderately strong association and establishes the exposure as a significant risk factor.\n\n2.  **Risk Difference ($RD$)**: An $RD$ of $0.0400$ (or $4.00\\%$) quantifies the absolute excess risk attributable to the exposure. This value is particularly crucial for public health and clinical contexts. It implies that if the exposure were completely eliminated from the population of exposed individuals, there would be a reduction in the $10$-year cancer risk by $4.00$ percentage points. In more concrete terms, for every $100$ individuals from whom the exposure is removed, one could expect to prevent $4$ cases of cancer over a decade that would otherwise have occurred. Since the problem states the exposure is modifiable, the $RD$ provides a direct estimate of the potential public health benefit of an intervention (a primary prevention program) aimed at eliminating this exposure.

The NNT is a measure of the effectiveness of a health intervention. It is defined as the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR).\n\nLet us define the relevant quantities using the provided data.\nThe risk of an event in the control group (no aspirin) is denoted as $R_{\\text{control}}$.\nThe risk of an event in the treatment group (with aspirin) is denoted as $R_{\\text{treat}}$.\nThe Relative Risk ($RR$) is the ratio of the risk in the treated group to the risk in the control group:\n$$RR = \\frac{R_{\\text{treat}}}{R_{\\text{control}}}$$\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$) is the difference in risk between the control group and the treated group:\n$$ARR = R_{\\text{control}} - R_{\\text{treat}}$$\nThe Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$) is the inverse of the $ARR$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nThis value represents the average number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one additional bad outcome.\n\nFirst, we focus on the primary outcome of interest: colorectal cancer.\nThe givens for colorectal cancer are:\nThe cumulative $10$-year risk of colorectal cancer without aspirin (control group): $R_{\\text{control, cancer}} = 0.04$.\nThe relative risk of colorectal cancer with aspirin versus no aspirin: $RR_{\\text{cancer}} = 0.75$.\n\nWe can calculate the risk of colorectal cancer in the group treated with aspirin, $R_{\\text{treat, cancer}}$, using the definition of relative risk:\n$$R_{\\text{treat, cancer}} = R_{\\text{control, cancer}} \\times RR_{\\text{cancer}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R_{\\text{treat, cancer}} = 0.04 \\times 0.75 = 0.03$$\nSo, the $10$-year risk of colorectal cancer for individuals in this cohort taking aspirin is $0.03$, or $3\\%$.\n\nNext, we calculate the Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$) for colorectal cancer.\n$$ARR_{\\text{cancer}} = R_{\\text{control, cancer}} - R_{\\text{treat, cancer}}$$\n$$ARR_{\\text{cancer}} = 0.04 - 0.03 = 0.01$$\nAlternatively, we can express the $ARR_{\\text{cancer}}$ in terms of $R_{\\text{control, cancer}}$ and $RR_{\\text{cancer}}$:\n$$ARR_{\\text{cancer}} = R_{\\text{control, cancer}} - (R_{\\text{control, cancer}} \\times RR_{\\text{cancer}}) = R_{\\text{control, cancer}} \\times (1 - RR_{\\text{cancer}})$$\n$$ARR_{\\text{cancer}} = 0.04 \\times (1 - 0.75) = 0.04 \\times 0.25 = 0.01$$\nThis means that taking aspirin reduces the absolute risk of developing colorectal cancer over $10$ years by $0.01$, or one percentage point.\n\nFinally, we compute the Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$) to prevent one case of colorectal cancer.\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR_{\\text{cancer}}} = \\frac{1}{0.01} = 100$$\nThe exact calculated value is $100$.
