It is a valid and formalizable problem in applied statistics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires the calculation of a patient's readmission probability, $p$, using a given logistic regression model. The model defines the log-odds of the probability, also known as the logit of $p$, as a linear combination of the patient's characteristics. Let the log-odds be denoted by $L$.\n\nThe formula for the log-odds is:\n$$\nL = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\,\\text{age} + \\beta_{2}\\,\\text{CCI} + \\beta_{3}\\,\\text{prior\\_adm}\n$$\nWe are given the following values:\n- $\\beta_{0} = -6.2$\n- $\\beta_{1} = 0.045$\n- $\\beta_{2} = 0.38$\n- $\\beta_{3} = 0.72$\n- $\\text{age} = 78$\n- $\\text{CCI} = 5$\n- $\\text{prior\\_adm} = 1$\n\nFirst, we substitute these values into the linear model to compute the value of the log-odds, $L$:\n$$\nL = -6.2 + (0.045 \\times 78) + (0.38 \\times 5) + (0.72 \\times 1)\n$$\nWe perform the multiplications first:\n$$\nL = -6.2 + 3.51 + 1.90 + 0.72\n$$\nNow, we sum the terms:\n$$\nL = -6.2 + (3.51 + 1.90 + 0.72) = -6.2 + 6.13\n$$\n$$\nL = -0.07\n$$\nThe value of the log-odds is $L = -0.07$. By definition, the log-odds is $\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) = -0.07\n$$\nTo find the probability $p$, we must solve this equation. This is achieved by applying the inverse of the logit function, which is the standard logistic function, often called the sigmoid function. We begin by exponentiating both sides of the equation with base $e$:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)\\right) = \\exp(-0.07)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{p}{1-p} = \\exp(-0.07)\n$$\nLet $E = \\exp(-0.07)$. The equation becomes $\\frac{p}{1-p} = E$. We now algebraically solve for $p$:\n$$\np = E(1-p)\n$$\n$$\np = E - E \\cdot p\n$$\n$$\np + E \\cdot p = E\n$$\n$$\np(1+E) = E\n$$\n$$\np = \\frac{E}{1+E}\n$$\nSubstituting $E = \\exp(-0.07)$ back into the expression for $p$:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\exp(-0.07)}{1 + \\exp(-0.07)}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value. First, we evaluate the exponential term:\n$$\n\\exp(-0.07) \\approx 0.9323938198\n$$\nNext, we substitute this value into the expression for $p$:\n$$\np \\approx \\frac{0.9323938198}{1 + 0.9323938198} = \\frac{0.9323938198}{1.9323938198}\n$$\n$$\np \\approx 0.4825020118\n$$\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. The first four significant figures are $4$, $8$, $2$, and $5$. The fifth digit is $0$, so we round down.\n$$\np \\approx 0.4825\n$$\nThus, the estimated probability of readmission for this patient is $0.4825$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4825}$$", "id": "4581324"}, {"introduction": "Once a tertiary prevention program is implemented, how do we measure its success in a way that truly matters to patients?

It draws upon established concepts in clinical epidemiology and biostatistics, such as the MCID, anchor-based methods, and distribution-based methods for interpreting changes in patient-reported outcomes. The context of tertiary prevention (post-stroke rehabilitation) is appropriate. The data provided are consistent and sufficient for deriving a reasoned rule as requested. The term \"conservative\" has a well-understood meaning in this context, guiding the decision process toward a more stringent threshold. There are no violations of scientific principles, logical contradictions, or ambiguities that would render the problem invalid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Operational Rule and Solution**\n\nThe determination of an MCID is crucial for interpreting the clinical relevance of an observed treatment effect, particularly in tertiary prevention where the goal is to improve quality of life and function. The problem presents two fundamental approaches for estimating the MCID: the anchor-based method and the distribution-based method.\n\n1.  **Anchor-Based Method**: This approach links the change in a score to a patient-reported anchor that is, by definition, clinically important. The problem provides an anchor-based estimate derived from a Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) study. This value represents the mean change in HRQoL score for patients who reported the smallest amount of change that they still considered important. The problem states this value is $5$ scale points.\n    $$\n    MCID_{anchor} = 5\n    $$\n\n2.  **Distribution-Based Method**: This approach uses the statistical properties of the measurement instrument's scores to define a threshold for change that is unlikely to be due to random error or statistical noise. A common and widely accepted distribution-based estimate for the MCID, particularly when reliability data for calculating the Standard Error of Measurement (SEM) are unavailable, is one-half of the baseline standard deviation ($SD$). This corresponds to a \"moderate\" effect size in a standardized metric.\n    \n    Given the baseline standard deviation $SD = 15$, the distribution-based estimate, which we will denote as $MCID_{dist}$, is calculated as:\n    $$\n    MCID_{dist} = 0.5 \\times SD\n    $$\n    Substituting the given value for $SD$:\n    $$\n    MCID_{dist} = 0.5 \\times 15 = 7.5\n    $$\n    This value, $7.5$ scale points, represents a change that is statistically distinct from the typical variation observed in the population.\n\n3.  **Derivation of a Conservative Operational Rule**: The task is to derive a *conservative* operational rule for combining these two estimates. In setting a threshold for clinical importance, \"conservative\" implies being cautious about concluding that an effect is meaningful. This translates to setting a higher bar, or a more stringent threshold, for the MCID. A higher MCID reduces the probability of classifying a small, potentially trivial or random change as clinically important.\n\n    We have two estimates for the MCID:\n    - $MCID_{anchor} = 5$ (reflecting the patient's perspective)\n    - $MCID_{dist} = 7.5$ (reflecting statistical signal-to-noise)\n\n    A logical and conservative rule is to adopt the larger of the two estimates. This ensures that the chosen MCID satisfies both the criterion of being statistically non-trivial (by being at least as large as the distribution-based estimate) and the criterion of patient-perceived importance (by being at least as large as the anchor-based estimate). Therefore, the operational rule is:\n    $$\n    MCID = \\max(MCID_{anchor}, MCID_{dist})\n    $$\n\n4.  **Computation of the MCID**: Applying this rule to the given values:\n    $$\n    MCID = \\max(5, 7.5)\n    $$\n    $$\n    MCID = 7.5\n    $$\n    The resulting MCID is $7.5$ scale points.\n\n**Justification in the Context of Tertiary Prevention**\nThis choice is justified for interpreting trial results in tertiary prevention for several reasons. Tertiary prevention aims to soften the impact of an ongoing illness, such as stroke, by improving patient function and quality of life. The effectiveness of such interventions must be judged by a standard that is both meaningful to patients and statistically robust.\n\n- The anchor-based value ($5$ points) provides the critical patient-centered perspective on what constitutes a worthwhile change.\n- The distribution-based value ($7.5$ points) ensures that the change is large enough to be distinguished from the inherent variability or \"noise\" in the HRQoL measurement within the patient population.\n- In this case, the anchor-based estimate is lower than the distribution-based estimate. Relying solely on the patient-perceived threshold of $5$ points might lead to declaring an intervention successful even if its effect is not clearly distinguishable from measurement error and random fluctuation.\n- By choosing the maximum of the two ($7.5$ points), we establish a more rigorous threshold. An intervention that achieves a mean difference of at least $7.5$ points can be considered not only statistically significant (as it surpasses the noise threshold) but also highly likely to be considered important by patients (as it surpasses their minimum threshold of $5$ points). This conservative approach strengthens the validity of any conclusion about the intervention's clinical importance, which is paramount when making recommendations for clinical practice and resource allocation in rehabilitation services.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.5}$$", "id": "4581356"}, {"introduction": "Even the most effective interventions must be evaluated for their financial sustainability within a health system.
