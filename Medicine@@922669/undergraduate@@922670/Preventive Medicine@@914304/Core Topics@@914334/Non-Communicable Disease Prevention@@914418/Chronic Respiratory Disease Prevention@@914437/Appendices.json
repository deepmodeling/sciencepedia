Express your final answer as a decimal proportion.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of epidemiology and probability theory, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its language.\n\nThe task is to first derive the expression for the direct age-standardized prevalence, $p_{\\text{std}}$, from fundamental principles and then compute its value for a specific case.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Direct Age-Standardized Prevalence Formula**\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a randomly selected individual from a population has Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The population is partitioned into $k$ mutually exclusive and exhaustive age strata. Let $A_i$ be the event that a randomly selected individual belongs to age stratum $i$, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, k\\}$. The fact that these strata form a partition of the population means that $\\bigcup_{i=1}^{k} A_i = \\Omega$ (where $\\Omega$ is the entire sample space) and $A_i \\cap A_j = \\emptyset$ for all $i \\neq j$.\n\nThe prevalence of a disease is defined as the proportion of individuals with the disease at a specified time. This corresponds to the probability $P(D)$. The age-specific prevalence for stratum $i$, denoted by $p_i$, is the conditional probability of having the disease given that the individual is in age stratum $i$. Formally, this is expressed as:\n$$p_i = P(D | A_i)$$\n\nThe Law of Total Probability states that the total probability of an event $D$ can be found by summing its conditional probabilities over a partition of the sample space. Applying this law to the event $D$ and the partition $\\{A_i\\}_{i=1}^k$, the overall prevalence in a population is:\n$$P(D) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} P(D | A_i) P(A_i)$$\nIn this expression, $P(A_i)$ is the proportion of the population in age stratum $i$.\n\nDirect age standardization is a method used to calculate a prevalence rate that would be observed in a study population if it had the age structure of a \"standard\" population. This allows for the comparison of disease rates between different populations by removing the confounding effect of age.\n\nLet a standard population be chosen, for which the proportion of individuals in each age stratum $i$ is given by a weight $w_i$. These weights constitute a probability distribution, so they must satisfy $w_i \\ge 0$ for all $i$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i = 1$. The weight $w_i$ is thus equivalent to the probability $P(A_i)$ in the standard population's age structure.\n\nTo compute the direct age-standardized prevalence, $p_{\\text{std}}$, for our study population, we apply its observed age-specific prevalences ($p_i$) to the age structure of the standard population ($w_i$). This is achieved by substituting $p_i$ for $P(D|A_i)$ and $w_i$ for $P(A_i)$ in the formula from the Law of Total Probability. This yields the expression for the direct age-standardized prevalence:\n$$p_{\\text{std}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i w_i$$\nThis formula represents a weighted average of the age-specific prevalences, where the weights are the proportions of each age group in the standard population.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Age-Standardized Prevalence**\n\nThe problem provides the following data for $k=3$ age strata:\nAge-specific COPD prevalences:\n- $p_{1} = 5\\% = 0.05$\n- $p_{2} = 10\\% = 0.10$\n- $p_{3} = 20\\% = 0.20$\n\nStandard population age weights:\n- $w_{1} = 0.5$\n- $w_{2} = 0.3$\n- $w_{3} = 0.2$\n\nWe can verify that the weights sum to unity: $w_1 + w_2 + w_3 = 0.5 + 0.3 + 0.2 = 1.0$.\n\nUsing the derived formula for $p_{\\text{std}}$ for $k=3$:\n$$p_{\\text{std}} = p_1 w_1 + p_2 w_2 + p_3 w_3$$\n\nSubstituting the given values into the expression:\n$$p_{\\text{std}} = (0.05)(0.5) + (0.10)(0.3) + (0.20)(0.2)$$\n$$p_{\\text{std}} = 0.025 + 0.030 + 0.040$$\n$$p_{\\text{std}} = 0.095$$\n\nThe computed direct age-standardized prevalence of COPD is $0.095$.
