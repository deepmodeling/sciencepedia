It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe solution is derived in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the expression for non-HDL-C**\n\nFrom first principles, the Total Cholesterol ($TC$) in the blood is the sum of the cholesterol contained within all different types of lipoprotein particles. The problem statement provides a fundamental partition of these particles into two categories: High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) particles and non-High-Density Lipoprotein particles.\n\nLet $C_{HDL}$ represent the cholesterol content in HDL particles, which is given as $HDL\\text{-}C$.\nLet $C_{non\\text{-}HDL}$ represent the cholesterol content in all other, non-HDL lipoproteins, which is defined as $non\\text{-}HDL\\text{-}C$.\n\nBased on this partitioning, the total cholesterol is the sum of the cholesterol in these two compartments:\n$$TC = C_{HDL} + C_{non\\text{-}HDL}$$\nSubstituting the standard clinical notation:\n$$TC = HDL\\text{-}C + non\\text{-}HDL\\text{-}C$$\nTo derive the expression for $non\\text{-}HDL\\text{-}C$, we rearrange the equation by isolating the $non\\text{-}HDL\\text{-}C$ term. This is achieved by subtracting $HDL\\text{-}C$ from both sides of the equation:\n$$non\\text{-}HDL\\text{-}C = TC - HDL\\text{-}C$$\nThis is the expression for $non\\text{-}HDL\\text{-}C$ derived from the first principles provided.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of non-HDL-C**\n\nThe problem provides the following values for a patient:\n$$TC = 220\\,\\text{mg/dL}$$\n$$HDL\\text{-}C = 45\\,\\text{mg/dL}$$\nUsing the derived expression, we substitute these values to compute the patient's $non\\text{-}HDL\\text{-}C$:\n$$non\\text{-}HDL\\text{-}C = 220\\,\\text{mg/dL} - 45\\,\\text{mg/dL}$$\n$$non\\text{-}HDL\\text{-}C = 175\\,\\text{mg/dL}$$\n\n**Part 3: Qualitative explanation of non-HDL-C as a risk measure**\n\nThe problem requires an explanation for why $non\\text{-}HDL\\text{-}C$ can be a more informative cardiovascular risk measure than Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ($LDL\\text{-}C$) alone, especially when triglycerides are elevated.\n\nThe core of the explanation lies in the definition of $non\\text{-}HDL\\text{-}C$. As stated in the problem, $non\\text{-}HDL\\text{-}C$ \"collectively summarized\" the cholesterol carried by all apolipoprotein B-containing particles. These particles, which include $LDL$, Very-Low-Density Lipoprotein ($VLDL$), Intermediate-Density Lipoprotein ($IDL$), and other remnant lipoproteins, are all considered atherogenic, meaning they contribute to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in arteries. Therefore, $non\\text{-}HDL\\text{-}C$ represents the total concentration of cholesterol within all potentially harmful lipoproteins.\n\nIn contrast, $LDL\\text{-}C$ measures the cholesterol content of only one of these particle types: the $LDL$ particles. While $LDL$ particles are a major driver of atherosclerosis, focusing solely on $LDL\\text{-}C$ can be misleading, particularly in certain metabolic states.\n\nThe condition of elevated triglycerides (hypertriglyceridemia) is one such state. High triglyceride levels are a marker for an increased number of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, namely $VLDL$ and their remnants ($IDL$ and other remnant lipoproteins). These particles are also atherogenic. In a patient with high triglycerides, the cholesterol content within these non-$LDL$, apolipoprotein B-containing particles can be substantial.\n\nAn assessment based on $LDL\\text{-}C$ alone would ignore the atherogenic contribution from the cholesterol carried by $VLDL$, $IDL$, and remnants. This leads to an underestimation of the total atherogenic lipoprotein burden and, consequently, an underestimation of cardiovascular risk.\n\nBecause $non\\text{-}HDL\\text{-}C$ is calculated as $TC - HDL\\text{-}C$, it inherently includes the cholesterol from all atherogenic particles ($LDL\\text{-}C + VLDL\\text{-}C + IDL\\text{-}C + \\text{remnant cholesterol}$). It serves as a single, comprehensive metric for the total \"atherogenic cholesterol\" in circulation. Its superiority as a risk predictor is most pronounced in hypertriglyceridemic states because the discrepancy between the total atherogenic burden ($non\\text{-}HDL\\text{-}C$) and the partial burden ($LDL\\text{-}C$) is largest in these individuals. Thus, $non\\text{-}HDL\\text{-}C$ provides a more complete picture of dyslipidemia-related risk than $LDL\\text{-}C$ alone.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{175}$$", "id": "4521582"}, {"introduction": "After assessing risk, the next step in preventive care is to plan effective treatment and set clear expectations.

The problem is well-posed, as all necessary information for the calculations is provided. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation of Solution**\nThe problem requires the calculation of two key epidemiological metrics based on the provided risk data.\n\nFirst, we define the risk in the treated group, denoted as $R_{\\text{treated}}$.

The formula is:\n$$RRR = \\frac{R_{\\text{untreated}} - R_{\\text{treated}}}{R_{\\text{untreated}}}$$\n\nNext, we define the absolute risk reduction ($ARR$). This is the simple arithmetic difference in event rates between the untreated and treated groups.\n$$ARR = R_{\\text{untreated}} - R_{\\text{treated}}$$\n\nWe can establish a direct relationship between $ARR$ and $RRR$. By rearranging the formula for $RRR$, we get:\n$$RRR \\times R_{\\text{untreated}} = R_{\\text{untreated}} - R_{\\text{treated}}$$\nThe right-hand side of this equation is the definition of $ARR$. Therefore, we have the direct relationship:\n$$ARR = RRR \\times R_{\\text{untreated}}$$\n\nUsing the given values, we can calculate the $ARR$:\n$$ARR = 0.40 \\times 0.20$$\n$$ARR = 0.08$$\nThis is the absolute risk reduction expressed as a decimal fraction, as requested.\n\nFinally, we calculate the number needed to treat ($NNT$). The $NNT$ is the reciprocal of the $ARR$. It represents the average number of patients who must be treated over the specified time period to prevent one adverse outcome.\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated value of $ARR$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.08}$$\nTo find the exact value, we can express the decimal as a fraction:\n$$0.08 = \\frac{8}{100} = \\frac{2}{25}$$\nTherefore, the $NNT$ is:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{\\frac{2}{25}} = \\frac{25}{2} = 12.5$$\nThe problem requests an exact value, and $12.5$ is the exact result of the calculation.\n\nThe computed values are an absolute risk reduction of $0.08$ and a number needed to treat of $12.5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.08  12.5 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4521544"}]}
