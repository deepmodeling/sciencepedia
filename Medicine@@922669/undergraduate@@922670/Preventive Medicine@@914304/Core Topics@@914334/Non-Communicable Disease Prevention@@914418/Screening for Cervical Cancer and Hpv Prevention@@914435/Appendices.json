The data provided are self-contained and consistent for the required derivations and calculations.\n\nTo solve this problem, we begin by defining the events and probabilities from first principles.\nLet $D$ be the event that a woman has the target condition, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade $3$ or greater (CIN3$+$).\nLet $D^c$ be the event that a woman does not have CIN3$+$.\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the HPV test result is positive.\nLet $T^-$ be the event that the HPV test result is negative.\n\nThe givens can be formally expressed as probabilities:\nThe prevalence of CIN3$+$ is the prior probability of having the disease:\n$P(D) = \\text{Prevalence} = 0.01$\nThe probability of not having the disease is therefore:\n$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$\n\nThe sensitivity of the test is the conditional probability of a positive test given the disease is present:\n$\\text{Sensitivity} = Se = P(T^+ | D) = 0.95$\n\nThe specificity of the test is the conditional probability of a negative test given the disease is absent:\n$\\text{Specificity} = Sp = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.85$\n\nFrom these definitions, we can also derive two other conditional probabilities:\nThe probability of a false negative (a negative test given disease is present) is:\n$P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - Se = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$\nThe probability of a false positive (a positive test given disease is absent) is:\n$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the Positive Predictive Value (PPV). The PPV is defined as the probability that a person has the disease given that they tested positive, $P(D | T^+)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result in the population. It can be found using the law of total probability, summing over the two mutually exclusive states of having the disease or not having the disease:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$P(T^+) = (Se \\cdot \\text{Prevalence}) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - \\text{Prevalence}))$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $P(T^+)$ back into the Bayes' theorem formula for PPV:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot \\text{Prevalence}}{(Se \\cdot \\text{Prevalence}) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - \\text{Prevalence}))}$$\nThis is the derived expression for PPV from first principles.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the Negative Predictive Value (NPV). The NPV is defined as the probability that a person does not have the disease given that they tested negative, $P(D^c | T^-)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$NPV = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test result. Using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)$$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$P(T^-) = (Sp \\cdot (1 - \\text{Prevalence})) + ((1 - Se) \\cdot \\text{Prevalence})$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $P(T^-)$ back into the Bayes' theorem formula for NPV:\n$$NPV = \\frac{Sp \\cdot (1 - \\text{Prevalence})}{(Sp \\cdot (1 - \\text{Prevalence})) + ((1 - Se) \\cdot \\text{Prevalence})}$$\nThis is the derived expression for NPV from first principles.\n\nNow we compute the numerical values for PPV and NPV using the given parameters: $Se = 0.95$, $Sp = 0.85$, and $\\text{Prevalence} = 0.01$.\n\nFor the PPV:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.95 \\cdot 0.01}{(0.95 \\cdot 0.01) + ((1 - 0.85) \\cdot (1 - 0.01))}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.0095}{0.0095 + (0.15 \\cdot 0.99)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.0095}{0.0095 + 0.1485}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.0095}{0.1580} \\approx 0.06012658...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $PPV = 0.06013$.\n\nFor the NPV:\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.85 \\cdot (1 - 0.01)}{(0.85 \\cdot (1 - 0.01)) + ((1 - 0.95) \\cdot 0.01)}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.85 \\cdot 0.99}{(0.85 \\cdot 0.99) + (0.05 \\cdot 0.01)}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.8415}{0.8415 + 0.0005}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.8415}{0.8420} \\approx 0.99940617...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $NPV = 0.9994$.\n\nFinally, the clinical implications of these results are interpreted.\nThe calculated Positive Predictive Value is $PPV \\approx 0.06013$. This signifies that among women aged $30$ to $65$ who receive a positive HPV test result, only approximately $6.013\\%$ actually have CIN3$+$ at the time of testing. The remaining approximately $94\\%$ of positive results are false positives. This low PPV is a characteristic feature of a screening test applied to a low-prevalence population, even when the test itself has high sensitivity and reasonable specificity. The clinical implication is that a positive HPV test is not a diagnosis but rather an indicator of increased risk that mandates further, more specific diagnostic workup, such as colposcopy and biopsy, to confirm the presence of disease.\n\nThe calculated Negative Predictive Value is $NPV \\approx 0.9994$. This extremely high value indicates that if a woman in this population tests negative, there is a $99.94\\%$ probability that she does not have CIN3$+$. The test is exceptionally reliable at ruling out the disease. The clinical implication is that a negative result provides strong reassurance and supports the current guideline recommendations for extending the screening interval to $5$ years. This reduces patient anxiety, costs, and the potential harms of over-screening and unnecessary diagnostic procedures. The high NPV is the primary strength and justification for using this test in primary screening.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.06013  0.9994 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4571319"}, {"introduction": "Modern preventive medicine increasingly relies on personalized risk assessment rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.
