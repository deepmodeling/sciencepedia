By working through this problem [@problem_id:4571978], you will learn how to derive PPV from first principles and interpret its meaning in a practical clinical context, such as the expected yield of diagnostic colonoscopies.", "problem": "An average-risk screening program for colorectal cancer (CRC) uses the Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) annually. In a well-validated population, the FIT has sensitivity $Se=0.74$ for CRC and specificity $Sp=0.95$. The point prevalence of CRC in the screened population at the time of testing is $P=0.005$. Using only the core definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence, and standard probability rules (including Bayes' theorem), derive the positive predictive value $PPV=\\Pr(\\text{CRC} \\mid \\text{FIT positive})$ from first principles and then compute its value for the given parameters. Finally, interpret what this $PPV$ implies for the expected colonoscopy yield following a positive FIT, assuming all FIT-positive individuals undergo diagnostic colonoscopy.\n\nRound your final numeric answer for $PPV$ to four significant figures and express it as a decimal (do not use a percent sign).", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) for a colorectal cancer (CRC) screening test, and an interpretation of the result. We begin by formalizing the problem using the language of probability theory.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that an individual has colorectal cancer.\nLet $\\neg D$ be the event that an individual does not have colorectal cancer.\nLet $T$ be the event that the Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) result is positive.\nLet $\\neg T$ be the event that the FIT result is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\nThe prevalence of CRC, which is the prior probability of having the disease: $\\Pr(D) = P = 0.005$.\nThe probability of not having the disease is therefore $\\Pr(\\neg D) = 1 - \\Pr(D) = 1 - P = 1 - 0.005 = 0.995$.\n\nThe sensitivity of the test, which is the probability of a positive test given the individual has the disease:\n$Se = \\Pr(T \\mid D) = 0.74$.\n\nThe specificity of the test, which is the probability of a negative test given the individual does not have the disease:\n$Sp = \\Pr(\\neg T \\mid \\neg D) = 0.95$.\n\nFrom the specificity, we can determine the probability of a positive test given the individual does not have the disease. This is the false positive rate.\n$\\Pr(T \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - \\Pr(\\neg T \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n\nThe goal is to find the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), which is defined as the probability that an individual has CRC given that their FIT result is positive. In probabilistic terms, we must find $\\Pr(D \\mid T)$.\n\nWe derive this value from first principles using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:\n$$ \\Pr(D \\mid T) = \\frac{\\Pr(T \\mid D) \\Pr(D)}{\\Pr(T)} $$\nThe numerator consists of terms that are known: $\\Pr(T \\mid D) = Se$ and $\\Pr(D) = P$. The term $\\Pr(T \\mid D) \\Pr(D)$ represents the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive, $\\Pr(T \\cap D)$.\n\nThe denominator, $\\Pr(T)$, is the overall probability of receiving a positive test result, regardless of disease status. We can calculate this using the law of total probability, by summing over the mutually exclusive scenarios of having the disease and not having the disease:\n$$ \\Pr(T) = \\Pr(T \\cap D) + \\Pr(T \\cap \\neg D) $$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $\\Pr(A \\cap B) = \\Pr(A \\mid B)\\Pr(B)$, we can rewrite this as:\n$$ \\Pr(T) = \\Pr(T \\mid D) \\Pr(D) + \\Pr(T \\mid \\neg D) \\Pr(\\neg D) $$\nNow, we substitute the given definitions and derived quantities into this expression:\n$$ \\Pr(T) = (Se \\times P) + ((1 - Sp) \\times (1 - P)) $$\nThis denominator represents the sum of true positives (people with the disease who test positive) and false positives (people without the disease who test positive), expressed as proportions of the total population.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $\\Pr(T)$ back into the Bayes' theorem formula for PPV, we obtain the general formula for PPV derived from first principles:\n$$ PPV = \\Pr(D \\mid T) = \\frac{\\Pr(T \\mid D) \\Pr(D)}{\\Pr(T \\mid D) \\Pr(D) + \\Pr(T \\mid \\neg D) \\Pr(\\neg D)} $$\nIn terms of the given parameters $Se$, $Sp$, and $P$:\n$$ PPV = \\frac{Se \\times P}{Se \\times P + (1 - Sp) \\times (1 - P)} $$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for the given parameters:\n$Se = 0.74$\n$Sp = 0.95$\n$P = 0.005$\n\nWe calculate the components of the formula:\nThe proportion of true positives in the population is:\n$Se \\times P = 0.74 \\times 0.005 = 0.0037$.\n\nThe proportion of false positives in the population is:\n$(1 - Sp) \\times (1 - P) = (1 - 0.95) \\times (1 - 0.005) = 0.05 \\times 0.995 = 0.04975$.\n\nThe total probability of a positive test is the sum of these two proportions:\n$\\Pr(T) = 0.0037 + 0.04975 = 0.05345$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the PPV:\n$$ PPV = \\frac{0.0037}{0.05345} \\approx 0.06922357... $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.06922$.\n\nThe final part of the problem asks for an interpretation of this PPV. A PPV of $0.06922$ signifies that for an individual selected at random from this average-risk population who receives a positive FIT result, the probability of them actually having colorectal cancer is approximately $6.92\\%$.\n\nIn the context of the screening program, where all FIT-positive individuals are referred for a diagnostic colonoscopy, this PPV value directly translates to the expected diagnostic yield of colonoscopy for CRC. It implies that out of all colonoscopies performed due to a positive FIT, approximately $6.92\\%$ are expected to detect and confirm a case of colorectal cancer. To state it differently, for every $10000$ colonoscopies performed on this FIT-positive group, we would expect to find approximately $692$ cases of CRC. The remaining majority of cases (approximately $93.08\\%$) would be false positives for CRC, meaning the colonoscopy would not find cancer, although it might reveal other conditions such as pre-cancerous polyps (adenomas), which the FIT is also known to detect.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.06922}\n$$", "id": "4571978"}, {"introduction": "Beyond evaluating individual tests, it is essential to measure the overall impact of a screening program on a population's health. This practice introduces the Number Needed to Screen (NNS), a powerful metric that quantifies the efficiency of a public health intervention by determining how many people must be screened to prevent one adverse outcome.

Definition of Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)**\n\nIn words, the **Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)** is the arithmetic difference in the risk of an adverse outcome between an untreated (or control) group and a treated (or intervention) group. It quantifies the absolute decrease in risk attributable to the intervention.\n\nSymbolically, let $p_0$ be the risk of the outcome in the control group (unscreened population) and $p_1$ be the risk of the outcome in the intervention group (screened population). The ARR is defined as:\n$$ \\mathrm{ARR} = p_0 - p_1 $$\n\n**2. Definition and Justification of Number Needed to Screen (NNS)**\n\nIn words, the **Number Needed to Screen (NNS)** is the average number of individuals who must undergo the screening process over a specified period to prevent one adverse outcome (in this case, one death from colorectal cancer). It is an inverse measure of the intervention's efficiency; a smaller NNS indicates a more efficient intervention.\n\nSymbolically, the NNS is the reciprocal of the ARR:\n$$ \\mathrm{NNS} = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{ARR}} $$\nThe justification from first principles is as follows: The ARR represents the number of adverse outcomes prevented per person screened. For example, if $\\mathrm{ARR} = 0.01$, this means that on average, $0.01$ deaths are prevented for each person who participates in the screening program. To find the number of people one needs to screen to prevent one full death, we can set up a simple proportion:\n$$ \\frac{1 \\text{ event prevented}}{\\text{NNS people}} = \\frac{\\text{ARR} \\text{ events prevented}}{1 \\text{ person}} $$\nSolving for NNS gives $\\mathrm{NNS} = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{ARR}}$.\n\n**3.
