It is based on the standard definition of Body Mass Index (BMI) and the fundamental principles of error analysis. All necessary data are provided, and they are internally consistent and physically realistic. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe Body Mass Index (BMI) is defined as:\n$$\nBMI = \\frac{w}{h^2}\n$$\nwhere $w$ is the body mass in kilograms ($\\mathrm{kg}$) and $h$ is the height in meters ($\\mathrm{m}$).\n\nLet $w$ be the true mass, $h_t$ be the true height, and $h_m$ be the measured height. The problem states that the mass is measured without error, so the same value $w$ is used for both calculations. The true BMI, $BMI_t$, and the measured BMI, $BMI_m$, are given by:\n$$\nBMI_t = \\frac{w}{h_t^2}\n$$\n$$\nBMI_m = \\frac{w}{h_m^2}\n$$\n\nThe first task is to derive symbolically the multiplicative bias in BMI. The multiplicative bias, which we can denote as $k$, is the factor by which the true BMI is multiplied to obtain the measured BMI. It is the ratio of the measured BMI to the true BMI.\n$$\nk = \\frac{BMI_m}{BMI_t}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $BMI_m$ and $BMI_t$:\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{w}{h_m^2}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{w}{h_t^2}\\right)}\n$$\nThe mass $w$ cancels out, yielding the symbolic expression for the multiplicative bias:\n$$\nk = \\frac{h_t^2}{h_m^2} = \\left(\\frac{h_t}{h_m}\\right)^2\n$$\nSince the height is underestimated, we have $h_m < h_t$, which implies that the ratio $\\frac{h_t}{h_m} > 1$. Consequently, the bias factor $k > 1$, indicating that an underestimation of height leads to an overestimation of BMI.\n\nThe second task is to evaluate the relative error in BMI for the given numbers. The relative error, which we will denote as $\\epsilon_{BMI}$, is defined in the problem statement as:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{BMI} = \\frac{BMI_m - BMI_t}{BMI_t}\n$$\nThis expression can be simplified by separating the fraction:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{BMI} = \\frac{BMI_m}{BMI_t} - \\frac{BMI_t}{BMI_t} = \\frac{BMI_m}{BMI_t} - 1\n$$\nWe have already derived the ratio $\\frac{BMI_m}{BMI_t}$, which is the multiplicative bias $k$. Thus, the relative error can be expressed symbolically as:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{BMI} = \\left(\\frac{h_t}{h_m}\\right)^2 - 1\n$$\nThe problem provides the following numerical values:\n- True height, $h_t = 1.71\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Measured height, $h_m = 1.70\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Body mass (not needed for this calculation), $w = 80\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n\nSubstituting the values for height into the expression for the relative error:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{BMI} = \\left(\\frac{1.71}{1.70}\\right)^2 - 1\n$$\nTo perform the calculation exactly, we can treat the numbers as fractions:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{BMI} = \\left(\\frac{171/100}{170/100}\\right)^2 - 1 = \\left(\\frac{171}{170}\\right)^2 - 1\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{BMI} = \\frac{171^2}{170^2} - 1 = \\frac{171^2 - 170^2}{170^2}\n$$\nUsing the algebraic identity for the difference of squares, $a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$:\n$$\n171^2 - 170^2 = (171 - 170)(171 + 170) = (1)(341) = 341\n$$\nAnd the denominator is:\n$$\n170^2 = 28900\n$$\nSo, the exact relative error is:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{BMI} = \\frac{341}{28900}\n$$\nNow, we convert this fraction to a decimal:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{BMI} \\approx 0.01180069204...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first non-zero digit is $1$ (in the hundredths place), so the first four significant figures are $1$, $1$, $8$, and $0$. The fifth significant figure is $0$, so we round down (i.e., we truncate at the fourth significant figure).\n$$\n\\epsilon_{BMI} \\approx 0.01180\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.01180}$$", "id": "4557424"}, {"introduction": "Predicting weight change requires moving beyond simplistic calorie counting to applying the fundamental principles of thermodynamics and physiology.

It is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds from the First Law of Thermodynamics applied to human energy balance, which states that the change in the body's stored energy, $\\Delta E_{\\text{stored}}$, is equal to the energy consumed, $E_{\\text{in}}$, minus the energy expended, $E_{\\text{out}}$.\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\text{stored}} = E_{\\text{in}} - E_{\\text{out}} $$\nFor a change over a period of time, this can be written as:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\text{stored}} = \\Delta E_{\\text{in}} - \\Delta E_{\\text{out}} $$\nwhere $\\Delta E_{\\text{in}}$ and $\\Delta E_{\\text{out}}$ represent the total change in intake and expenditure, respectively, over the specified duration.\n\nThe problem states that one daily serving of an SSB is replaced, representing a gross reduction in daily energy intake. Let this be $\\Delta E_{\\text{in,gross}} = 150 \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{day}}$.\n\nA partial energy compensation of $C = 0.30$ is specified. This means that $30\\%$ of the reduced energy intake is offset by other behavioral or physiological adjustments (e.g., slightly increased consumption of other foods). The net daily reduction in energy intake, which we define as the daily energy deficit $\\Delta E_{\\text{deficit}}$, is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\text{deficit}} = \\Delta E_{\\text{in,gross}} \\times (1 - C) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\text{deficit}} = 150 \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{day}} \\times (1 - 0.30) = 150 \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{day}} \\times 0.70 = 105 \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{day}} $$\nThis daily deficit means the net change in daily energy intake is $\\Delta E_{\\text{in,daily}} = -105 \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{day}}$.\n\nThe intervention period, $T$, is $12$ weeks.

This implies that the total energy expenditure does not change, so $\\Delta E_{\\text{out}} = 0$.\n\nNow, we can find the total change in stored energy:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\text{stored}} = \\Delta E_{\\text{in}} - \\Delta E_{\\text{out}} = -8820 \\text{ kcal} - 0 \\text{ kcal} = -8820 \\text{ kcal} $$\n\nThe change in stored energy is related to the change in body weight, $\\Delta W$, through the energy density of body weight change, $\\rho_E$.\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\text{stored}} = \\Delta W \\times \\rho_E $$\nWe can now solve for $\\Delta W$:\n$$ \\Delta W = \\frac{\\Delta E_{\\text{stored}}}{\\rho_E} $$\nSubstituting the values for $\\Delta E_{\\text{stored}}$ and $\\rho_E$:\n$$ \\Delta W = \\frac{-8820 \\text{ kcal}}{7.7 \\times 10^{3} \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{kg}}} = \\frac{-8820}{7700} \\text{ kg} $$\nPerforming the division:\n$$ \\Delta W = -1.145454... \\text{ kg} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.

It is a well-posed question in epidemiology that is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The provided parameters are realistic for the association between obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).\n\nWe begin by deriving the formula for the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) from fundamental definitions.\n\nLet $I_t$ be the total incidence rate of T2DM in the population.\nLet $I_e$ be the incidence rate of T2DM in the exposed group (individuals with obesity).\nLet $I_u$ be the incidence rate of T2DM in the unexposed group (individuals without obesity).\nLet $P_e$ be the prevalence of the exposure (obesity) in the population. Then, the prevalence of the unexposed is $P_u = 1 - P_e$.\n\nThe total incidence in the population, $I_t$, can be expressed as the weighted average of the incidence rates in the exposed and unexposed subgroups, where the weights are the prevalences of these subgroups:\n$$I_t = (I_e \\times P_e) + (I_u \\times P_u)$$\nSubstituting $P_u = 1 - P_e$, we get:\n$$I_t = (I_e \\times P_e) + (I_u \\times (1 - P_e))$$\n\nThe Relative Risk, $RR$, is defined as the ratio of the incidence in the exposed group to the incidence in the unexposed group:\n$$RR = \\frac{I_e}{I_u}$$\nFrom this definition, we can express the incidence in the exposed group in terms of the incidence in the unexposed group and the relative risk:\n$$I_e = RR \\times I_u$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $I_e$ into the equation for the total incidence $I_t$:\n$$I_t = ((RR \\times I_u) \\times P_e) + (I_u \\times (1 - P_e))$$\nFactoring out $I_u$, we obtain:\n$$I_t = I_u (RR \\times P_e + 1 - P_e)$$\n\nThe Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) is defined as the proportion of the disease incidence in the total population that is attributable to the exposure.
