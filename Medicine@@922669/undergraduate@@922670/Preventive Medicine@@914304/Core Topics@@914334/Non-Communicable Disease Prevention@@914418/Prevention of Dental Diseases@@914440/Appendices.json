The values provided, such as a fluoride concentration of $1450$ ppm and a pea-sized application mass of $1.0$ g, are standard and clinically realistic in the context of dental public health and preventive medicine.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

The assumptions of homogeneity and uniform distribution are explicitly stated, which is necessary for the calculation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the mass of fluoride, $m_F$, that remains intra-orally after brushing. This mass is the product of the mass of toothpaste retained in the mouth, $m_{TP, retained}$, and the mass fraction of fluoride in the toothpaste.\n\nFirst, we determine the mass of toothpaste retained. The initial mass of the toothpaste application is $m_{TP} = 1.0$ g. The retention fraction is given as $R = 30\\%$, which is equivalent to a dimensionless factor of $0.30$.\nThe mass of toothpaste retained is:\n$$m_{TP, retained} = R \\times m_{TP}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$m_{TP, retained} = 0.30 \\times 1.0 \\text{ g} = 0.30 \\text{ g}$$\n\nNext, we address the fluoride concentration, $C_F$. The problem states the concentration is $1450$ ppm by mass and requires the use of the definition $1 \\text{ ppm} = \\frac{1 \\text{ mg solute}}{1 \\text{ kg mixture}}$.\nTherefore, a concentration of $1450$ ppm fluoride is equivalent to:\n$$C_F = 1450 \\frac{\\text{mg F}}{\\text{kg toothpaste}}$$\nThe mass of fluoride, $m_F$, in a given mass of toothpaste, $m_{TP, retained}$, is calculated by multiplying the mass of the toothpaste by its fluoride concentration. For this calculation to be dimensionally consistent, the mass of the toothpaste must be expressed in kilograms (kg) to match the units of the concentration term.\n\nWe convert the mass of retained toothpaste from grams (g) to kilograms (kg), knowing that $1 \\text{ kg} = 1000 \\text{ g}$:\n$$m_{TP, retained} = 0.30 \\text{ g} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ kg}}{1000 \\text{ g}} = 0.00030 \\text{ kg} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ kg}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass of fluoride delivered, $m_{F, delivered}$, which is the mass of fluoride present in the retained toothpaste:\n$$m_{F, delivered} = C_F \\times m_{TP, retained}$$\nSubstituting the values for concentration and retained mass:\n$$m_{F, delivered} = \\left( 1450 \\frac{\\text{mg F}}{\\text{kg toothpaste}} \\right) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ kg toothpaste})$$\nThe unit of 'kg toothpaste' cancels, leaving the result in milligrams (mg) of fluoride, as required.\n$$m_{F, delivered} = 1450 \\times 3.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ mg}$$\n$$m_{F, delivered} = 4350 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ mg}$$\n$$m_{F, delivered} = 0.435 \\text{ mg}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

The problem provides:\n$$CI_{unsealed} = 12\\% = 0.12$$\nThe efficacy, $E$, is given as $60\\%$, or $0.60$. Efficacy is defined as the proportional reduction in cumulative incidence in the treated group relative to the control group. This is mathematically expressed as:\n$$E = \\frac{CI_{unsealed} - CI_{sealed}}{CI_{unsealed}}$$\nThis quantity is also known as the Relative Risk Reduction ($RRR$). We can use this relationship to find the cumulative incidence in the sealed group, $CI_{sealed}$.\n$$E = 1 - \\frac{CI_{sealed}}{CI_{unsealed}}$$\nRearranging for $CI_{sealed}$:\n$$\\frac{CI_{sealed}}{CI_{unsealed}} = 1 - E$$\n$$CI_{sealed} = CI_{unsealed} \\times (1 - E)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$CI_{sealed} = 0.12 \\times (1 - 0.60) = 0.12 \\times 0.40 = 0.048$$\n\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$) is the absolute difference in the risk (cumulative incidence) between the control and intervention groups.\n$$ARR = CI_{unsealed} - CI_{sealed}$$\nSubstituting the calculated value for $CI_{sealed}$:\n$$ARR = 0.12 - 0.048 = 0.072$$\nAlternatively, by substituting the expression for $CI_{sealed}$ into the $ARR$ formula, we can express $ARR$ in terms of $CI_{unsealed}$ and $E$:\n$$ARR = CI_{unsealed} - (CI_{unsealed} \\times (1 - E)) = CI_{unsealed} - CI_{unsealed} + (CI_{unsealed} \\times E)$$\n$$ARR = CI_{unsealed} \\times E$$\nUsing this direct formula:\n$$ARR = 0.12 \\times 0.60 = 0.072$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to three significant figures. The exact value $0.072$ has two significant figures. To express it with three, we add a trailing zero.\n$$ARR_{rounded} = 0.0720$$\n\nNext, we calculate the Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$). The $NNT$ is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction. The problem specifies using the *exact* $ARR$ for this calculation.\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nUsing the exact value $ARR = 0.072$:\n$$NNT_{exact} = \\frac{1}{0.072} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{72}{1000}} = \\frac{1000}{72}$$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$\\frac{1000}{72} = \\frac{500}{36} = \\frac{250}{18} = \\frac{125}{9}$$\nAs a decimal, this is $13.888...$\nThe problem requires the $NNT$ to be reported as the least integer greater than or equal to this exact value. This is equivalent to applying the ceiling function.\n$$NNT_{final} = \\lceil NNT_{exact} \\rceil = \\lceil \\frac{125}{9} \\rceil = \\lceil 13.888... \\rceil = 14$$\nThus, one would need to apply sealants to $14$ children to prevent one case of occlusal caries over a $2$-year period.\n\nThe two requested values are the absolute risk reduction ($0.0720$) and the Number Needed to Treat ($14$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.0720 & 14 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4558162"}]}
