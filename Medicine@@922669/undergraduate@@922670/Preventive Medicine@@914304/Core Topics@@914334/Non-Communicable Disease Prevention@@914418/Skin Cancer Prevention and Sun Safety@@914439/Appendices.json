Use the following foundational model and definitions to derive how under-application changes the effective protection and then estimate the resulting effective Sun Protection Factor.\n\nFundamental definitions and assumptions:\n1. Sun Protection Factor (SPF) is defined as the ratio of the minimal erythema dose without sunscreen to that with sunscreen, which can be expressed in terms of spectral irradiance and the erythema action spectrum as\n$$\n\\mathrm{SPF}(m) \\equiv \\frac{\\int_{\\lambda} E(\\lambda)\\,A(\\lambda)\\,d\\lambda}{\\int_{\\lambda} E(\\lambda)\\,A(\\lambda)\\,T(\\lambda,m)\\,d\\lambda},\n$$\nwhere $E(\\lambda)$ is the solar spectral irradiance at wavelength $\\lambda$, $A(\\lambda)$ is the erythema action spectrum weight, and $T(\\lambda,m)$ is the spectral transmittance of the sunscreen film at applied mass per unit area $m$.\n\n2. The sunscreen film follows a non-linear, Beer–Lambert-type transmittance model as a function of applied mass per unit area:\n$$\nT(\\lambda,m) = \\exp\\!\\big(-\\kappa(\\lambda)\\,m\\big),\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa(\\lambda)$ is an effective mass-specific attenuation coefficient that depends on wavelength but not on $m$.\n\n3.

The values provided are realistic for sunscreen products and their use. The problem is well-posed; it provides a clear set of definitions and asks for the derivation of a simplified model and a subsequent calculation. It is self-contained and internally consistent. The language is objective and precise. The crucial instruction to \"introduce an appropriate spectrally averaged attenuation parameter\" guides the modeling approach, indicating that a direct solution of the integral is not intended, but rather the creation and calibration of a simplified model. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Proceed to Solution\n\nThe definition of SPF can be written by substituting the transmittance model into the SPF equation:\n$$ \\mathrm{SPF}(m) = \\frac{\\int_{\\lambda} E(\\lambda)\\,A(\\lambda)\\,d\\lambda}{\\int_{\\lambda} E(\\lambda)\\,A(\\lambda)\\,\\exp(-\\kappa(\\lambda)\\,m)\\,d\\lambda} $$\nLet us define a weighting function $W(\\lambda) = E(\\lambda)\\,A(\\lambda)$, which represents the erythemally-effective spectral irradiance.

The problem directs us to derive a simplified expression by introducing an appropriate spectrally averaged attenuation parameter. This implies we should construct a simplified model that captures the essential relationship between SPF and application mass $m$.\n\nA plausible simplified model replaces the spectrally-dependent attenuation $\\kappa(\\lambda)$ with a single, effective, spectrally-averaged attenuation coefficient, $\\bar{\\kappa}$. The form of this model should be consistent with the Beer-Lambert law structure. If the radiation were monochromatic, the SPF would be simply the inverse of the transmittance, i.e., $1/T = 1/\\exp(-\\kappa m) = \\exp(\\kappa m)$. We postulate a simplified model, $\\mathrm{SPF}_{s}(m)$, that follows this monochromatic analogue:\n$$ \\mathrm{SPF}_{s}(m) = \\exp(\\bar{\\kappa}m) $$\nHere, $\\bar{\\kappa}$ is a constant parameter for a given sunscreen product, which does not depend on the application mass $m$.\n\nThe problem states that this model must preserve the calibration at the standard application mass $m_{0}$. This means we must calibrate our model by enforcing the condition that it reproduces the labeled SPF at the standard Mass:\n$$ \\mathrm{SPF}_{s}(m_{0}) = \\mathrm{SPF}_{\\text{label}} $$\nSubstituting $m_{0}$ into our model's equation:\n$$ \\exp(\\bar{\\kappa}m_{0}) = \\mathrm{SPF}_{\\text{label}} $$\nWe can now solve for the effective attenuation coefficient $\\bar{\\kappa}$:\n$$ \\bar{\\kappa}m_{0} = \\ln(\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\text{label}}) $$\n$$ \\bar{\\kappa} = \\frac{\\ln(\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\text{label}})}{m_{0}} $$\nThis gives us a calibrated value for our model parameter $\\bar{\\kappa}$ based on the product's labeled information.\n\nNow, we can write the simplified expression for the effective SPF at any application mass $m$ by substituting the expression for $\\bar{\\kappa}$ back into our model equation:\n$$ \\mathrm{SPF}(m) \\approx \\mathrm{SPF}_{s}(m) = \\exp\\left( \\left(\\frac{\\ln(\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\text{label}})}{m_{0}}\\right) m \\right) $$\nUsing the property of logarithms $a\\ln(b) = \\ln(b^a)$ and the fact that $\\exp(\\ln(x)) = x$, we can simplify this expression:\n$$ \\mathrm{SPF}_{s}(m) = \\exp\\left( \\frac{m}{m_{0}} \\ln(\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\text{label}}) \\right) = \\exp\\left( \\ln\\left( (\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\text{label}})^{m/m_{0}} \\right) \\right) $$\n$$ \\mathrm{SPF}_{s}(m) = (\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\text{label}})^{m/m_{0}} $$\nThis is the derived simplified expression for the effective SPF, $\\mathrm{SPF}(m)$, in terms of the labeled SPF, $\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\text{label}}$, the standard application mass, $m_0$, and the actual application mass, $m$.\n\nThe final step is to estimate the effective SPF for the given values:\n-   $\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\text{label}} = 50$\n-   $m_{0} = 2\\,\\text{mg/cm}^2$\n-   $m = 1\\,\\text{mg/cm}^2$\n\nThe ratio of application masses is:\n$$ \\frac{m}{m_{0}} = \\frac{1\\,\\text{mg/cm}^2}{2\\,\\text{mg/cm}^2} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nSubstituting these values into our derived expression:\n$$ \\mathrm{SPF}_{\\text{eff}} = (50)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{50} $$\nTo obtain a numerical value, we calculate the square root:\n$$ \\sqrt{50} = \\sqrt{25 \\times 2} = 5\\sqrt{2} $$\nUsing the value of $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41421356...$, we get:\n$$ \\mathrm{SPF}_{\\text{eff}} \\approx 5 \\times 1.41421356 = 7.0710678... $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as requested, gives:\n$$ \\mathrm{SPF}_{\\text{eff}} \\approx 7.071 $$\nThus, applying the sunscreen at half the standardized amount reduces the effective SPF from $50$ to approximately $7.071$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.071}$$", "id": "4574529"}, {"introduction": "To effectively design and advocate for public health initiatives, we must move from individual risk assessment to a population-level perspective.
