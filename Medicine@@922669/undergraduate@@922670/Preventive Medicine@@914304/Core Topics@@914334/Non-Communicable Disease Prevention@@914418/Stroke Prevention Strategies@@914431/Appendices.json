The concepts of risk, relative risk (RR), absolute risk reduction (ARR), and number needed to treat (NNT) are fundamental to clinical epidemiology and preventive medicine. The values provided for baseline risk ($12\\%$) and relative risk reduction (RR of $0.7$) are plausible for a high-risk population undergoing antihypertensive therapy.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary data and definitions to compute the required quantities. The relationship between RR and risk in treated vs. untreated groups is standard and explicitly reinforced by the multiplicative scaling assumption.

A solution will be derived based on the provided data and standard epidemiological definitions.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe problem requires the calculation of the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) and the Number Needed to Treat (NNT). We begin by defining the relevant epidemiological quantities.\n\nLet $R_{u}$ be the risk of an event (in this case, stroke) in the untreated or control group. From the problem statement, this is the baseline $10$-year cumulative risk.\n$$R_{u} = 0.12$$\nLet $R_{t}$ be the risk of the event in the treated group.\nThe Relative Risk ($RR$) is defined as the ratio of the risk in the treated group to the risk in the untreated group.\n$$RR = \\frac{R_{t}}{R_{u}}$$\nThe problem provides the value for $RR$.\n$$RR = 0.7$$\nThe problem statement's assumption that \"the treatment effect scales the event probability multiplicatively\" is a direct statement of this definition. We can use this relationship to calculate the risk in the treated group, $R_{t}$.\n$$R_{t} = RR \\times R_{u}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R_{t} = 0.7 \\times 0.12 = 0.084$$\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) is defined as the difference in risk between the untreated and treated groups.\n$$ARR = R_{u} - R_{t}$$\nSubstituting the values for $R_{u}$ and $R_{t}$:\n$$ARR = 0.12 - 0.084 = 0.036$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. The number $0.036$ has two significant figures (the leading zeros are not significant). To express this with a precision of four significant figures, we append two zeros.\n$$ARR_{\\text{rounded}} = 0.03600$$\nThe Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Reduction. It represents the average number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one additional adverse outcome.\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nUsing the unrounded value of $ARR$ for a more precise calculation of $NNT$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.036} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{36}{1000}} = \\frac{1000}{36} = \\frac{250}{9} \\approx 27.777...$$\nThe problem requires the NNT to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures of $27.777...$ are $2$, $7$, $7$, and $7$. The fifth digit is $7$, which is $5$ or greater, so we round up the fourth significant digit.\n$$NNT_{\\text{rounded}} = 27.78$$\n\nThus, the Absolute Risk Reduction over $10$ years is $0.03600$, and the Number Needed to Treat over $10$ years is $27.78$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.03600  27.78 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4579709"}, {"introduction": "Effective stroke prevention is not one-size-fits-all; it requires tailoring interventions to an individual's specific risk profile.
