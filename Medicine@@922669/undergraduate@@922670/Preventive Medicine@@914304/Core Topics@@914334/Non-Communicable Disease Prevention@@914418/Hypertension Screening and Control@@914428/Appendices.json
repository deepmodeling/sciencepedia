The use of a blood pressure cuff that is too small for a patient's arm (undercuffing) is a well-documented source of systematic error, causing falsely elevated blood pressure readings. The rule that cuff bladder width should be approximately $40\\%$ of the arm circumference is a standard clinical guideline. The linear model for the bias as a function of the degree of undercuffing is a reasonable and commonly used local approximation in epidemiological studies. The numerical values provided are plausible.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear, quantitative relationship and all necessary data to calculate a unique solution.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of subjective or ambiguous terms.\n4.  **Complete and Consistent**: The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. It provides all necessary definitions, constants, and conditions.\n5.  **Realistic and Feasible**: The scenario and values are realistic in a clinical screening context. A relative undercuffing of $u=0.20$ is a common occurrence.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet $B_{SYS}$ and $B_{DIA}$ be the measurement biases for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, in units of millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The problem states that there is a linear relationship between these biases and the relative undercuffing fraction, $u$.\n\nGiven that there is no systematic bias when the correct cuff size is used (i.e., when $w = w_r$, which implies $u = 0$), the linear relationship must be one of direct proportionality. We can express the biases as:\n$$B_{SYS} = k_{SYS} \\cdot u$$\n$$B_{DIA} = k_{DIA} \\cdot u$$\nwhere $k_{SYS}$ and $k_{DIA}$ are the proportionality constants, or slopes, for the systolic and diastolic biases, respectively.\n\nThe problem provides the data to determine these constants. For an increment in the undercuffing fraction, $\\Delta u = 0.10$, the corresponding changes in bias are $\\Delta B_{SYS} = 4.5$ mmHg and $\\Delta B_{DIA} = 3.0$ mmHg.\n\nThe constant $k_{SYS}$ is calculated as the ratio of the change in systolic bias to the change in the undercuffing fraction:\n$$k_{SYS} = \\frac{\\Delta B_{SYS}}{\\Delta u} = \\frac{4.5}{0.10} = 45 \\text{ mmHg}$$\nSimilarly, the constant $k_{DIA}$ is calculated for the diastolic bias:\n$$k_{DIA} = \\frac{\\Delta B_{DIA}}{\\Delta u} = \\frac{3.0}{0.10} = 30 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n\nNow, we have the specific linear models for the biases:\n$$B_{SYS} = 45 u$$\n$$B_{DIA} = 30 u$$\n\nThe problem asks for the expected biases when the relative undercuffing fraction is $u = 0.20$. We substitute this value into our derived equations.\n\nFor the systolic blood pressure bias:\n$$B_{SYS} = 45 \\times 0.20 = 9.0 \\text{ mmHg}$$\nFor the diastolic blood pressure bias:\n$$B_{DIA} = 30 \\times 0.20 = 6.0 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n\nThe sign convention states that a positive bias denotes overestimation, which is the expected direction of error for undercuffing. Our results are positive, consistent with this convention.\n\nThe final result is to be expressed as a row matrix $(\\text{systolic}, \\text{diastolic})$.
