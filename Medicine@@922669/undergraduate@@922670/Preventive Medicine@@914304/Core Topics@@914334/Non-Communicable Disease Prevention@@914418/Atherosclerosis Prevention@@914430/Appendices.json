Sustained weight reduction is a well-tested strategy to lower these risks through improvements in lipid profiles, blood pressure, and insulin sensitivity.

The value for the energy density of adipose tissue is a standard, empirically derived estimate used in this field. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and explicit assumptions (constant expenditure, no metabolic adaptation) to define a solvable, albeit simplified, model. These simplifications are common in introductory problems to isolate the core principles and do not render the problem scientifically unsound. The language is objective and the requirements are unambiguous. All data are consistent. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution is partitioned into two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n#### Part 1: Daily Caloric Deficit\n\nThe total energy deficit required to lose a certain mass of adipose tissue is determined by the energy density of that tissue. Let $\\Delta E_{week}$ be the total energy deficit required for one week. This is calculated by multiplying the target mass loss per week, $R_{loss}$, by the energy density of adipose tissue, $E_{tissue}$.\n\nGiven:\n-   Target mass loss per week, $R_{loss} = 0.5\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{week}^{-1}$.\n-   Energy density of adipose tissue, $E_{tissue} = 7700\\,\\text{kcal}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}$.\n\nThe required weekly energy deficit is:\n$$ \\Delta E_{week} = R_{loss} \\times E_{tissue} $$\n$$ \\Delta E_{week} = (0.5\\,\\text{kg}) \\times (7700\\,\\text{kcal}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}) = 3850\\,\\text{kcal} $$\nTo achieve this weekly deficit, a constant daily deficit must be maintained. Let $\\Delta E_{day}$ be the daily caloric deficit. Since there are $7$ days in a week, the daily deficit is the weekly deficit divided by $7$.\n$$ \\Delta E_{day} = \\frac{\\Delta E_{week}}{7\\,\\text{days}} $$\n$$ \\Delta E_{day} = \\frac{3850\\,\\text{kcal}}{7\\,\\text{days}} = 550\\,\\text{kcal}\\,\\text{day}^{-1} $$\nThe problem requires this answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The exact result is $550$. To express this quantity unambiguously with three significant figures, we use scientific notation: $5.50 \\times 10^{2}$.\n\n#### Part 2: Time to Achieve 10% Weight Reduction\n\nFirst, we calculate the total mass to be lost. The initial body weight is $m_{initial} = 100\\,\\text{kg}$. The target reduction is $10\\%$.\nLet $\\Delta m_{total}$ be the total mass to be lost.\n$$ \\Delta m_{total} = m_{initial} \\times 10\\% = 100\\,\\text{kg} \\times 0.10 = 10\\,\\text{kg} $$\nThe program achieves a steady fat loss at a rate of $R_{loss} = 0.5\\,\\text{kg}$ per week. The time required, $t$, to lose the total target mass is the total mass to be lost divided by the rate of loss.\n$$ t = \\frac{\\Delta m_{total}}{R_{loss}} $$\n$$ t = \\frac{10\\,\\text{kg}}{0.5\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{week}^{-1}} = 20\\,\\text{weeks} $$\nThe problem requires this answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The exact result is $20$. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $20.0$.\n\nThe two requested values are a daily deficit of $5.50 \\times 10^2\\,\\text{kcal}\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$ and a time of $20.0\\,\\text{weeks}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 5.50 \\times 10^{2}  20.0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4504068"}, {"introduction": "Evaluating the effectiveness of a preventive intervention requires fluency in the language of clinical epidemiology.
