[@problem_id:4507177]", "problem": "A primary care practice is evaluating the utility of office blood pressure measurement for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease by assessing how well it classifies patients’ true hypertension status, where true hypertension is defined by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Consider the following scientifically plausible scenario:\n\n- True hypertension (by ABPM) has population prevalence $p = 0.30$ in the screened adult cohort.\n- White-coat hypertension arises when a person without true hypertension is misclassified as having office hypertension. Empirically, among those without true hypertension, the probability of being labeled office hypertensive is $0.15$.\n- Masked hypertension arises when a person with true hypertension is misclassified as having office normotension. Empirically, among those with true hypertension, the probability of being labeled office normotensive is $0.12$.\n- Assume these misclassification phenomena fully account for departures from perfect classification by office measurement; that is, there are no other sources of measurement error beyond white-coat and masked hypertension.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and conditional probability from epidemiology and preventive medicine, derive an expression for the positive predictive value (PPV), $P(\\text{true hypertension} \\mid \\text{office hypertension})$, of office blood pressure classification for true hypertension in this population, and compute its numerical value for the given parameters. Round your final numerical answer to four significant figures and express it as a unitless decimal.\n\nIn your derivation, explicitly quantify the population fractions misclassified due to white-coat and masked hypertension to justify your PPV computation, but report only the PPV as your final answer.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a self-contained, consistent set of parameters from which the desired quantity can be derived using established principles of clinical epidemiology and probability theory.\n\nLet us define the following events for clarity in our derivation:\n- $H_T$: The patient has true hypertension, as defined by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM).\n- $H_T^c$: The patient does not have true hypertension (complement of $H_T$).\n- $H_O$: The patient is classified as having office hypertension based on office blood pressure measurement.\n- $H_O^c$: The patient is classified as having office normotension (complement of $H_O$).\n\nFrom the problem statement, we extract the following given probabilities:\n1. The population prevalence of true hypertension is $p = P(H_T) = 0.30$.\n2. The probability of having office hypertension among those without true hypertension (the definition of white-coat hypertension's conditional probability) is $P(H_O \\mid H_T^c) = 0.15$.\n3. The probability of having office normotension among those with true hypertension (the definition of masked hypertension's conditional probability) is $P(H_O^c \\mid H_T) = 0.12$.\n\nFrom the prevalence of true hypertension, we can deduce the prevalence of no true hypertension:\n$$P(H_T^c) = 1 - P(H_T) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$$\n\nThe performance of the office blood pressure measurement as a diagnostic test is characterized by its sensitivity and specificity.\n- **Sensitivity** is the probability that a patient with true hypertension is correctly classified as having office hypertension. It is denoted by $P(H_O \\mid H_T)$. Since a patient with true hypertension can either be classified as having office hypertension ($H_O$) or office normotension ($H_O^c$), we have $P(H_O \\mid H_T) + P(H_O^c \\mid H_T) = 1$. Using the provided data for masked hypertension:\n$$ \\text{Sensitivity} = P(H_O \\mid H_T) = 1 - P(H_O^c \\mid H_T) = 1 - 0.12 = 0.88 $$\n\n- **Specificity** is the probability that a patient without true hypertension is correctly classified as having office normotension. It is denoted by $P(H_O^c \\mid H_T^c)$. Since a patient without true hypertension can either be classified as having office hypertension ($H_O$) or office normotension ($H_O^c$), we have $P(H_O \\mid H_T^c) + P(H_O^c \\mid H_T^c) = 1$. Using the provided data for white-coat hypertension:\n$$ \\text{Specificity} = P(H_O^c \\mid H_T^c) = 1 - P(H_O \\mid H_T^c) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 $$\n\nThe problem asks for the positive predictive value (PPV), which is the probability that a patient with office hypertension actually has true hypertension, $P(H_T \\mid H_O)$. We derive this using Bayes' theorem:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(H_T \\mid H_O) = \\frac{P(H_O \\mid H_T) P(H_T)}{P(H_O)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(H_O)$, is the total probability of a patient having office hypertension. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, summing the probabilities of true positives and false positives:\n$$ P(H_O) = P(H_O \\cap H_T) + P(H_O \\cap H_T^c) $$\n$$ P(H_O) = P(H_O \\mid H_T) P(H_T) + P(H_O \\mid H_T^c) P(H_T^c) $$\nThe first term, $P(H_O \\mid H_T) P(H_T)$, represents the proportion of the population who are true positives (correctly identified as hypertensive). The second term, $P(H_O \\mid H_T^c) P(H_T^c)$, represents the proportion of the population who are false positives (misclassified due to white-coat hypertension).\n\nAs required by the prompt, we quantify the population fractions misclassified.\n- The fraction of the population misclassified due to **white-coat hypertension** (false positives) is:\n$$ P(H_O \\cap H_T^c) = P(H_O \\mid H_T^c) P(H_T^c) = (0.15)(0.70) = 0.105 $$\n- The fraction of the population misclassified due to **masked hypertension** (false negatives) is:\n$$ P(H_O^c \\cap H_T) = P(H_O^c \\mid H_T) P(H_T) = (0.12)(0.30) = 0.036 $$\n\nNow, we can compute the total probability of office hypertension, $P(H_O)$:\n- The probability of a true positive is $P(H_O \\mid H_T) P(H_T) = (\\text{Sensitivity})(P(H_T)) = (0.88)(0.30) = 0.264$.\n- The probability of a false positive is $0.105$ as calculated above.\n- Therefore, $P(H_O) = 0.264 + 0.105 = 0.369$.\n\nFinally, we substitute these values into the expression for the PPV:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(H_T \\mid H_O) = \\frac{P(H_O \\mid H_T) P(H_T)}{P(H_O)} = \\frac{0.264}{0.369} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV} \\approx 0.715447154... $$\nRounding the numerical value to four significant figures as requested, we obtain $0.7154$.\nThis value represents the probability that a patient found to have high blood pressure in the office setting truly has hypertension as confirmed by the gold-standard ABPM, given the characteristics of the screening test and the prevalence of the condition in the population.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7154}$$", "id": "4507177"}, {"introduction": "Initial risk scores provide a valuable starting point, but preventive medicine is moving towards a more personalized approach.

All necessary data are provided, and the values are consistent with those found in clinical literature. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two main stages: first, updating the patient's risk based on the new information (CAC score), and second, calculating the expected treatment benefit based on this updated risk.\n\nLet $p_{0}$ be the prior probability (baseline $10$-year ASCVD risk), $O_{\\text{prior}}$ be the prior odds, $p_{\\text{post}}$ be the posterior probability (risk after the CAC test), and $O_{\\text{post}}$ be the posterior odds.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of clinical epidemiology, well-posed with sufficient data and clear definitions, and objective in its presentation. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nLet us formally define the quantities involved, adhering to the problem's definitions.\nLet $R_{U}$ be the untreated (baseline) risk of an event over the specified $10$-year horizon. From the problem, we are given $R_{U} = 0.08$.\nLet $R_{T}$ be the risk of an event over the same horizon for a patient receiving the treatment.\nThe relative risk, $RR$, is defined as the ratio of the treated risk to the untreated risk:\n$$RR = \\frac{R_{T}}{R_{U}}$$\nThe relative risk reduction, $RRR$, is the complement of the relative risk:\n$$RRR = 1 - RR$$\nWe are given that the meta-analysis reports an $RRR$ of $0.25$.\nThe absolute risk reduction, $ARR$, is the arithmetic difference between the untreated and treated risks:\n$$ARR = R_{U} - R_{T}$$\nThe number needed to treat, $NNT$, is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\n\nOur first objective is to derive the correct absolute risk reduction for this patient.

Specifically, the ratio of the misinterpreted benefit to the correct benefit is $\\frac{0.25}{0.02} = 12.5$. Thus, the misinterpretation leads to an overestimation of the treatment's effect by a factor of $12.5$.\nFurthermore, the misinterpreted value is not only an overestimation but also a logical and scientific impossibility in this context.
