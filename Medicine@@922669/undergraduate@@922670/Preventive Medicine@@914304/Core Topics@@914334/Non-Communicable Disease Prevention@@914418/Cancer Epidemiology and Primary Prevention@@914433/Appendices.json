The concepts of cumulative incidence, cohort study, relative risk, and risk difference are standard, well-defined measures. The given incidence values are plausible for a common cancer over a decade.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data to calculate the two requested epidemiological measures. The definitions are standard, and a unique solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise and objective, describing a typical epidemiological scenario without bias or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nLet $I_e$ be the cumulative incidence, or risk, of the cancer in the exposed group, and let $I_u$ be the cumulative incidence in the unexposed group. The problem provides the following values for a $10$-year follow-up period:\n$$I_e = 0.08$$\n$$I_u = 0.04$$\n\nThe Relative Risk ($RR$) is a measure of the strength of association between the exposure and the outcome. It is defined as the ratio of the incidence in the exposed group to the incidence in the unexposed group.\n$$RR = \\frac{I_e}{I_u}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$RR = \\frac{0.08}{0.04} = 2$$\nAs per the problem's instruction to round to three significant figures, the value is $2.00$.\n\nThe Risk Difference ($RD$), also known as the Attributable Risk among the exposed, is a measure of the absolute effect of the exposure on the outcome. It represents the excess risk in the exposed group compared to the unexposed group. It is defined as the difference in incidence rates.\n$$RD = I_e - I_u$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$RD = 0.08 - 0.04 = 0.04$$\nAs per the problem's instruction to round to three significant figures, the value is $0.0400$.\n\n### Interpretation for Primary Prevention\n\nThe calculated effect sizes have direct implications for primary prevention.\n\n1.  **Relative Risk ($RR$)**: An $RR$ of $2.00$ indicates that individuals with the exposure are twice as likely to develop the specific cancer over the $10$-year period compared to those without the exposure. This signifies a moderately strong association and establishes the exposure as a significant risk factor.\n\n2.  **Risk Difference ($RD$)**: An $RD$ of $0.0400$ (or $4.00\\%$) quantifies the absolute excess risk attributable to the exposure. This value is particularly crucial for public health and clinical contexts. It implies that if the exposure were completely eliminated from the population of exposed individuals, there would be a reduction in the $10$-year cancer risk by $4.00$ percentage points. In more concrete terms, for every $100$ individuals from whom the exposure is removed, one could expect to prevent $4$ cases of cancer over a decade that would otherwise have occurred. Since the problem states the exposure is modifiable, the $RD$ provides a direct estimate of the potential public health benefit of an intervention (a primary prevention program) aimed at eliminating this exposure. It translates the strength of association ($RR$) into a tangible public health impact.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2.00 & 0.0400 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4506465"}, {"introduction": "Moving from individual risk to population-level impact is a key step in public health planning. This exercise focuses on the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF), a metric that estimates the proportion of disease cases in a population that could be prevented if a specific risk factor were eliminated entirely.

Let $I_{0}$ denote the incidence of lung cancer in never-smokers, $I_{1}$ the incidence in current smokers, and $I_{p}$ the overall population incidence.

It is scientifically grounded in established principles, provides all necessary data, and is free of ambiguities or contradictions. We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) from first principles, its calculation for the given parameters, and its interpretation.\n\nLet $p$ be the prevalence of the exposure (current smoking) in the adult population.\nLet $RR$ be the relative risk of the outcome (lung cancer) in the exposed group compared to the unexposed group.\nLet $I_0$ be the incidence rate of lung cancer in the unexposed group (never-smokers).\nLet $I_1$ be the incidence rate of lung cancer in the exposed group (current smokers).\nLet $I_p$ be the overall incidence rate of lung cancer in the total population.\n\nThe Givens are:\n$p = 0.3$\n$RR = 10$\n\nThe population is partitioned into two groups: smokers (exposed), with proportion $p$, and never-smokers (unexposed), with proportion $1-p$. The overall population incidence, $I_p$, is the weighted average of the incidence rates in these two subpopulations:\n$$I_p = (I_1 \\times p) + (I_0 \\times (1-p))$$\n\nThe relative risk, $RR$, is defined as the ratio of the incidence in the exposed group to the incidence in the unexposed group:\n$$RR = \\frac{I_1}{I_0}$$\nFrom this definition, we can express the incidence in the exposed group, $I_1$, in terms of the incidence in the unexposed group, $I_0$, and the relative risk, $RR$:\n$$I_1 = I_0 \\times RR$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $I_1$ into the equation for the overall population incidence, $I_p$:\n$$I_p = (I_0 \\times RR \\times p) + (I_0 \\times (1-p))$$\nWe can factor out $I_0$ from the right-hand side:\n$$I_p = I_0 \\times (p \\times RR + (1-p))$$\n$$I_p = I_0 \\times (p \\times RR + 1 - p)$$\n$$I_p = I_0 \\times (p(RR - 1) + 1)$$\nThis equation expresses the total population incidence as a function of the baseline incidence $I_0$, the exposure prevalence $p$, and the relative risk $RR$.\n\nThe Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) is defined as the proportion of all incident cases in the population that can be attributed to the exposure. It represents the fraction of cases that would be averted if the exposure were completely eliminated from the population. If the exposure were eliminated, the entire population would experience the incidence rate of the unexposed group, $I_0$.\n\nThe total number of cases in the population is proportional to $I_p$. The number of cases that would remain if the exposure were eliminated is proportional to $I_0$. Therefore, the number of cases attributable to the exposure is proportional to the difference $I_p - I_0$. The PAF is the ratio of these attributable cases to the total cases:\n$$\\text{PAF} = \\frac{I_p - I_0}{I_p}$$\n\nWe can also express this as:\n$$\\text{PAF} = 1 - \\frac{I_0}{I_p}$$\nNow, we substitute our derived expression for $I_p$ into the denominator:\n$$\\text{PAF} = 1 - \\frac{I_0}{I_0 \\times (p(RR - 1) + 1)}$$\nAssuming $I_0 > 0$, we can cancel $I_0$ from the numerator and denominator:\n$$\\text{PAF} = 1 - \\frac{1}{p(RR - 1) + 1}$$\nTo combine these terms, we find a common denominator:\n$$\\text{PAF} = \\frac{(p(RR - 1) + 1) - 1}{p(RR - 1) + 1}$$\n$$\\text{PAF} = \\frac{p(RR - 1)}{p(RR - 1) + 1}$$\nThis is the desired expression for PAF in terms of $p$ and $RR$.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for the PAF using the given values $p=0.3$ and $RR=10$:\n$$\\text{PAF} = \\frac{0.3 \\times (10 - 1)}{0.3 \\times (10 - 1) + 1}$$\n$$\\text{PAF} = \\frac{0.3 \\times 9}{0.3 \\times 9 + 1}$$\n$$\\text{PAF} = \\frac{2.7}{2.7 + 1}$$\n$$\\text{PAF} = \\frac{2.7}{3.7}$$\n$$\\text{PAF} \\approx 0.7297297...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\\text{PAF} \\approx 0.7297$$\n\nFinally, we interpret this result. A PAF of $0.7297$ signifies that approximately $72.97\\%$ of lung cancer cases in this population are attributable to cigarette smoking. Under the assumptions of the model (causality, no confounding, and no change in other risk factors following the intervention), a primary prevention policy that successfully eliminates smoking entirely could be expected to reduce the incidence of lung cancer in the population by $72.97\\%$.

Derivation of PPV and NPV from First Principles**\n\nThe positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that a subject has the disease given a positive test result, $\\Pr(D \\mid T^{+})$. Using the definition of conditional probability, which is a rearrangement of the definition of joint probability $\\Pr(A \\cap B) = \\Pr(A|B)\\Pr(B) = \\Pr(B|A)\\Pr(A)$, we can write Bayes' theorem as:\n$$\n\\Pr(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{\\Pr(T^{+} \\mid D) \\Pr(D)}{\\Pr(T^{+})}\n$$\nThe denominator, $\\Pr(T^{+})$, is the overall probability of testing positive.

Influence of Prevalence and Specificity on False Positives**\n\nThe expected number of false positives in a screened population of size $N$ is given by the number of individuals without the disease multiplied by the probability of a false positive test result for them. The number of individuals without the disease is $N(1-p)$. The probability that an individual without the disease tests positive is $\\Pr(T^{+} \\mid \\neg D) = 1-Sp$.\nTherefore, the expected false positive count is:\n$$\n\\text{False Positives} = N \\times (1-p) \\times (1-Sp)\n$$\nThis expression shows that the burden of false positives is directly proportional to two factors: the proportion of the population that is disease-free, $(1-p)$, and the false positive rate of the test, $(1-Sp)$. In a screening context where the disease is rare (prevalence $p$ is low), the term $(1-p)$ is very close to $1$. Consequently, the vast majority of the population is disease-free. In this scenario, the number of false positives is almost entirely driven by the specificity. Even a high specificity value, such as $Sp=0.95$, corresponds to a non-zero false positive rate of $1-Sp=0.05$. When this rate is applied to a large population of healthy individuals, it results in a substantial absolute number of false positives, which can overwhelm the number of true positives, leading to a low PPV.\n\nQuantification for a population of $N = 100,000$:\n- Prevalence $p=0.01$, Specificity $Sp=0.95$, Sensitivity $Se=0.90$.\n- Number of individuals with disease (True Cases): $100,000 \\times 0.01 = 1,000$.\n- Number of individuals without disease: $100,000 \\times (1 - 0.01) = 99,000$.\n- Expected number of True Positives (TP): Number of individuals with disease who test positive.\n  $$\n  \\text{TP} = (\\text{Number with disease}) \\times Se = 1,000 \\times 0.90 = 900\n  $$\n- Expected number of False Positives (FP): Number of individuals without disease who test positive.\n  $$\n  \\text{FP} = (\\text{Number without disease}) \\times (1-Sp) = 99,000 \\times (1 - 0.95) = 99,000 \\times 0.05 = 4,950\n  $$\nThe expected false positive count is $4,950$.\n\nThe false positive to true positive ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{FP}}{\\text{TP}} = \\frac{4,950}{900} = 5.5\n$$\nThis means that for every one true positive case detected, there are approximately $5.5$ false positive results, highlighting the burden of follow-up tests and patient anxiety in a low-prevalence screening program.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.1538 & 0.9989\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4506408"}]}
