The foundational facts are:\n- Maximal heart rate is the highest heart rate a person can achieve during maximal exercise.\n- Resting heart rate is the heart rate at rest, typically measured after several minutes of quiet sitting.\n- Heart Rate Reserve (HRR) is defined as the difference between maximal heart rate and resting heart rate.\n- Exercise intensity, specified as a fraction between $0$ and $1$, is operationalized by selecting a target heart rate that is linearly scaled between the resting and maximal levels according to that fraction of HRR.\n\nA $40$-year-old patient has directly measured maximal heart rate $HR_{\\max} = 180$ beats per minute (bpm) and resting heart rate $HR_{\\text{rest}} = 60$ bpm.

The inclusion of this data point does not create a contradiction but instead requires a discerning application of the provided information. The problem is thus deemed valid.\n\nWe now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the statement that the \"target heart rate that is linearly scaled between the resting and maximal levels according to that fraction of HRR.\" This can be formalized mathematically. The total range of heart rate available for exercise adaptation is the Heart Rate Reserve ($HRR$):\n$$HRR = HR_{\\max} - HR_{\\text{rest}}$$\n\nThe target heart rate, $HR_{\\text{target}}$, is constructed by taking a specific fraction, $f$, of this range and adding it to the baseline heart rate, which is the resting heart rate, $HR_{\\text{rest}}$. This establishes a linear relationship. The portion of the reserve to be utilized is $f \\times HRR$.\n\nTherefore, the general expression for the target heart rate is:\n$$HR_{\\text{target}} = HR_{\\text{rest}} + (f \\times HRR)$$\n\nSubstituting the definition of $HRR$ into this expression yields the complete formula for the target heart rate based on the provided principles:\n$$HR_{\\text{target}} = HR_{\\text{rest}} + f \\times (HR_{\\max} - HR_{\\text{rest}})$$\n\nThis is the required derived expression.

According to the principle of overload, adaptations are driven by stressing a physiological system beyond its accustomed level. For $VO_2^{\\max}$, which is determined by the integrated function of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and muscular systems, exercise intensity is a particularly potent stimulus.\n-   Let's calculate the relative intensity for the participants. Their baseline $VO_2^{\\max}$ is $30$ $\\mathrm{mL}\\cdot\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$. In METs, this is:\n    $$ VO_2^{\\max} (\\text{in METs}) = \\frac{30 \\text{ mL}\\cdot\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{min}^{-1}}{3.5 \\text{ mL}\\cdot\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{min}^{-1} \\text{ per MET}} \\approx 8.57 \\text{ METs} $$\n-   **HIIT intensity:** The intervals are performed at $8$ METs, which is approximately $8 / 8.57 \\approx 93\\%$ of the participants' current $VO_2^{\\max}$. This is a very high relative intensity.\n-   **MICT intensity:** The continuous training is performed at $5$ METs, which is approximately $5 / 8.57 \\approx 58\\%$ of the participants' current $VO_2^{\\max}$. This is a moderate relative intensity.\n-   High-intensity training is known to be a superior stimulus for inducing central adaptations (e.g., increased maximal cardiac output, primarily through increased stroke volume) and peripheral adaptations (e.g., mitochondrial biogenesis, increased capillary density in muscle) that underpin improvements in $VO_2^{\\max}$. Even when matched for total work (volume, or MET-minutes), HIIT protocols consistently demonstrate equal or greater improvements in $VO_2^{\\max}$ compared to traditional MICT, particularly in previously sedentary or insufficiently active individuals. The high-intensity intervals provide a powerful overload stimulus that MICT does not.\n-   Therefore, the HIIT prescription is expected to produce a larger increase in $VO_2^{\\max}$ than the MICT prescription.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Both prescriptions meet $500$ to $1000$ MET-minutes per week. MICT meets the moderate-intensity time target ($\\geq 150$ minutes per week), whereas HIIT does not meet the vigorous-only time target ($\\geq 75$ minutes per week) but does meet the equivalent combination target. HIIT is expected to produce a larger increase in $VO_2^{\\max}$ than MICT because the high-intensity intervals preferentially overload maximal cardiac output despite similar weekly MET-minutes.**\n-   \"Both prescriptions meet $500$ to $1000$ MET-minutes per week.\" - **Correct**. We calculated $672$ (HIIT) and $750$ (MICT).\n-   \"MICT meets the moderate-intensity time target ($\\geq 150$ minutes per week)...\" - **Correct**. It provides exactly $150$ minutes.\n-   \"...whereas HIIT does not meet the vigorous-only time target ($\\geq 75$ minutes per week)...\" - **Correct**. It provides only $36$ minutes.\n-   \"...but does meet the equivalent combination target.\" - **Correct**. It provides $168$ moderate-equivalent minutes.\n-   \"HIIT is expected to produce a larger increase in $VO_2^{\\max}$... because the high-intensity intervals preferentially overload maximal cardiac output...\" - **Correct**. This aligns with the principles of overload and specificity and is supported by a large body of scientific literature.\nThis option is entirely consistent with our analysis. Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Only MICT meets $500$ to $1000$ MET-minutes per week; HIIT falls short because its vigorous minutes are below $75$. Therefore, HIIT cannot meet guideline targets, and expected $VO_2^{\\max}$ changes are equal because total weekly volume is similar.**\n-   \"Only MICT meets $500$ to $1000$ MET-minutes per week...\" - **Incorrect**. HIIT also meets this target with $672$ MET-minutes.\n-   \"...HIIT falls short because its vigorous minutes are below $75$.\" - This is a flawed causal link. The MET-minute calculation is independent of the time-based targets.\n-   \"...HIIT cannot meet guideline targets...\" - **Incorrect**. HIIT meets both the MET-minute target and the equivalent combination time target.\n-   \"...expected $VO_2^{\\max}$ changes are equal because total weekly volume is similar.\" - **Incorrect**. This ignores the critical role of intensity.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. HIIT meets the vigorous-only time target and produces smaller $VO_2^{\\max}$ improvements than MICT because the recovery periods reduce the training stimulus below the level needed for central adaptation.**\n-   \"HIIT meets the vigorous-only time target...\" - **Incorrect**. It provides $36$ minutes, which is less than the $75$-minute minimum.\n-   \"...produces smaller $VO_2^{\\max}$ improvements than MICT...\" - **Incorrect**. The higher intensity of HIIT is expected to produce larger, not smaller, improvements.\n-   \"...because the recovery periods reduce the training stimulus...\" - **Incorrect physiological reasoning**. The purpose of recovery periods is to allow for repeated bouts of high-intensity work, which collectively provide a potent stimulus.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Both prescriptions meet $500$ to $1000$ MET-minutes per week. MICT produces a greater $VO_2^{\\max}$ improvement because it accumulates more total minutes, and HIIT does not meet the equivalent combination time target due to insufficient moderate-equivalent minutes.**\n-   \"Both prescriptions meet $500$ to $1000$ MET-minutes per week.\" - **Correct**.\n-   \"MICT produces a greater $VO_2^{\\max}$ improvement because it accumulates more total minutes...\" - **Incorrect**. The premise that more minutes ($150$ vs $132$ total) outweighs a large difference in intensity ($5$ METs vs $8$ METs) for $VO_2^{\\max}$ adaptation is physiologically unsound. Intensity is the more powerful driver.\n-   \"...HIIT does not meet the equivalent combination time target...\" - **Incorrect**.
