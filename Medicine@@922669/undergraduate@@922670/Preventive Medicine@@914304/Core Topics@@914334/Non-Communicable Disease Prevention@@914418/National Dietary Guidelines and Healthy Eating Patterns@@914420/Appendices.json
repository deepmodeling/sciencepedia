The value of $14$ g per $1000$ kcal is the established recommendation from the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) in the United States. The given energy and fiber intake values are well within a realistic range for an adult. The premise is factually sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined. It provides all necessary numerical data and a clear, linear model for the relationship between energy intake and nutrient requirements. The objective is unambiguous: calculate a target intake and then a deficit. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution can be derived from the provided information.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.

A complete, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\nThe problem requires us to calculate the necessary increase in daily fiber intake for an adult to meet the national dietary guideline, based on their specific energy consumption. The solution is derived from the fundamental definition of nutrient density.\n\nLet $D_{AI}$ represent the energy-normalized Adequate Intake for fiber density, provided as $14$ grams per $1000$ kilocalories.\n$$D_{AI} = \\frac{14 \\text{ g}}{1000 \\text{ kcal}}$$\nTo work with consistent units, we can express this density in grams per kilocalorie:\n$$D_{AI} = 0.014 \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{kcal}}$$\n\nLet $E$ be the individual's habitual daily energy intake. The problem states this value is stable at:\n$$E = 2400 \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{day}}$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the total daily need for a nutrient scales linearly with total energy intake. This is the definition of a constant nutrient density. Therefore, the target daily fiber intake, which we denote as $N_{target}$, is the product of the AI fiber density and the total daily energy intake.\n$$N_{target} = D_{AI} \\times E$$\n\nSubstituting the given values into this equation, we can calculate the target fiber intake:\n$$N_{target} = \\left(0.014 \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{kcal}}\\right) \\times \\left(2400 \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{day}}\\right)$$\n$$N_{target} = 33.6 \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{day}}$$\nThis is the daily amount of fiber the individual should consume to meet the guideline.\n\nThe problem states that the individual's current measured fiber intake, which we denote as $N_{current}$, is:\n$$N_{current} = 18 \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{day}}$$\n\nThe required increase in daily fiber intake, denoted as $\\Delta N$, is the difference between the target intake and the current intake.\n$$\\Delta N = N_{target} - N_{current}$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated target and given current intake:\n$$\\Delta N = 33.6 \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{day}} - 18 \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{day}}$$\n$$\\Delta N = 15.6 \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{day}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $15.6$ already has exactly three significant figures. Therefore, no further rounding is necessary.

The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A quantitative solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires us to calculate the new $10$-year CVD risk, $R_{\\text{new}}$, after a specific dietary change. We will follow a three-step process:\n1.  Calculate the total change in the AHEI score resulting from the substitution.\n2.  Determine the hazard ratio ($HR$) corresponding to this change in AHEI score.\n3.  Use the baseline risk and the calculated hazard ratio to compute the new risk.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Change in AHEI Score**\n\nLet $\\Delta S$ be the total change in the AHEI score. The substitution involves two components: removing processed meat and adding legumes.\n\nThe removal of $2$ servings per week of processed meat changes the score. Since each serving contributes $-0.7$ points, removing them results in a positive change. The change from removing processed meat, $\\Delta S_{\\text{meat}}$, is:\n$$ \\Delta S_{\\text{meat}} = - (2 \\text{ servings}) \\times (-0.7 \\frac{\\text{points}}{\\text{serving}}) = +1.4 \\text{ points} $$\n\nThe addition of $2$ servings per week of legumes, which each contribute $+0.5$ points, results in a change $\\Delta S_{\\text{legumes}}$:\n$$ \\Delta S_{\\text{legumes}} = + (2 \\text{ servings}) \\times (+0.5 \\frac{\\text{points}}{\\text{serving}}) = +1.0 \\text{ points} $$\n\nThe total change in the AHEI score is the sum of these two changes:\n$$ \\Delta S = \\Delta S_{\\text{meat}} + \\Delta S_{\\text{legumes}} = 1.4 + 1.0 = 2.4 \\text{ points} $$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Hazard Ratio for the Intervention**\n\nThe Cox proportional hazards model assumes an exponential relationship between the score ($S$) and the hazard, $h(t, S) = h_0(t)\\exp(\\beta S)$. The hazard ratio for a change $\\Delta S$ is given by $HR(\\Delta S) = \\exp(\\beta \\Delta S)$.\n\nWe are given that a $\\Delta S_{\\text{ref}} = 10$ point increase corresponds to a hazard ratio of $HR_{\\text{ref}} = 0.92$. We can use this to find the coefficient $\\beta$:\n$$ 0.92 = \\exp(\\beta \\times 10) $$\n$$ \\ln(0.92) = 10\\beta $$\n$$ \\beta = \\frac{\\ln(0.92)}{10} $$\n\nNow, we can calculate the hazard ratio for our intervention, $HR_{\\text{int}}$, which corresponds to the score change $\\Delta S = 2.4$:\n$$ HR_{\\text{int}} = \\exp(\\beta \\times \\Delta S) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\ln(0.92)}{10} \\times 2.4\\right) $$\nUsing the identity $\\exp(a \\ln b) = b^a$, we can rewrite this as:\n$$ HR_{\\text{int}} = \\exp\\left(\\ln(0.92) \\times \\frac{2.4}{10}\\right) = (0.92)^{0.24} $$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the New 10-Year CVD Risk**\n\nThe relationship between risk ($R$) over a fixed time period and the constant hazard ratio ($HR$) is derived from the survival function, $S(t) = (S_0(t))^{HR}$, where $S_0(t)$ is the baseline survival function. Since risk is $R = 1 - S$, the new risk $R_{\\text{new}}$ is related to the baseline risk $R_0$ by:\n$$ R_{\\text{new}} = 1 - S_{\\text{new}} = 1 - (S_0)^{HR_{\\text{int}}} = 1 - (1 - R_0)^{HR_{\\text{int}}} $$\n\nThis formula is equivalent to working with cumulative hazards. The risk $R$ over a time interval is $R = 1 - \\exp(-H)$, where $H$ is the cumulative hazard. The baseline risk is $R_0 = 0.12$. The baseline cumulative hazard $H_0$ is:\n$$ R_0 = 1 - \\exp(-H_0) \\implies 0.12 = 1 - \\exp(-H_0) \\implies \\exp(-H_0) = 0.88 $$\nThe proportional hazards assumption implies that the new cumulative hazard is $H_{\\text{new}} = H_0 \\times HR_{\\text{int}}$. The new risk $R_{\\text{new}}$ is:\n$$ R_{\\text{new}} = 1 - \\exp(-H_{\\text{new}}) = 1 - \\exp(-H_0 \\times HR_{\\text{int}}) = 1 - (\\exp(-H_0))^{HR_{\\text{int}}} $$\nSubstituting $\\exp(-H_0) = 0.88$:\n$$ R_{\\text{new}} = 1 - (0.88)^{HR_{\\text{int}}} $$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $HR_{\\text{int}}$:\n$$ R_{\\text{new}} = 1 - (0.88)^{(0.92)^{0.24}} $$\n\nFinally, we perform the numerical calculation:\nFirst, calculate the hazard ratio:\n$$ HR_{\\text{int}} = (0.92)^{0.24} \\approx 0.9801882 $$\nThen, calculate the new risk:\n$$ R_{\\text{new}} = 1 - (0.88)^{0.9801882} \\approx 1 - 0.882236 = 0.117764 $$\n\nThe problem asks to round the answer to four significant figures.\n$$ R_{\\text{new}} \\approx 0.1178 $$\nThis is the estimated new $10$-year CVD risk after the dietary substitution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1178}$$", "id": "4551113"}]}
