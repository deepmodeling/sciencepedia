The incidence proportion among the exposed, $I_e$, is the probability that any given exposed individual develops the disease during the specified time period. The number of disease cases observed in the exposed group can be modeled as a binomial random variable, and its expected value is the product of the number of individuals and the probability of the event.\nThe expected number of cases in the exposed group, let us denote it $E[\\text{Cases}_e]$, is:\n$$E[\\text{Cases}_e] = N_e \\times I_e$$\n\nThe problem defines an attributable case by referencing the counterfactual scenario: what would have happened to the exposed individuals if they had not been exposed. In this counterfactual state, this group of $N_e$ individuals would experience the risk of the unexposed population. The incidence proportion for this hypothetical scenario would be $I_u$.\nTherefore, the expected number of cases that would have occurred in this same cohort of $N_e$ individuals, had they been unexposed, is:\n$$E[\\text{Cases}_{e, \\text{counterfactual}}] = N_e \\times I_u$$\n\nThe expected number of cases attributable to the exposure, $E[AC_e]$, is the excess number of cases observed in the exposed group compared to what would have been expected in the absence of the exposure. This is the difference between the expected number of observed cases and the expected number of counterfactual cases.\n$$E[AC_e] = E[\\text{Cases}_e] - E[\\text{Cases}_{e, \\text{counterfactual}}]$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$E[AC_e] = (N_e \\times I_e) - (N_e \\times I_u)$$\nFactoring out $N_e$, we obtain the expression for the expected number of attributable cases:\n$$E[AC_e] = N_e (I_e - I_u)$$\n\nThe problem next asks to show that this expression can be written in terms of the Attributable Risk among the Exposed ($AR_e$). The $AR_e$, also known as the risk difference or excess risk, is defined as the absolute difference in incidence between the exposed and unexposed groups.\n$$AR_e = I_e - I_u$$\nBy substituting this definition back into our derived expression for $E[AC_e]$, we get:\n$$E[AC_e] = N_e \\times AR_e$$\nThis completes the derivation, showing that the expected number of attributable cases in the exposed group is the product of the size of the exposed population and the attributable risk among the exposed.\n\nFinally, we compute this value for the given cohort data:\n- Number exposed: $N_e = 12{,}500$\n- Incidence among exposed: $I_e = 0.032$\n- Incidence among unexposed: $I_u = 0.016$\n\nFirst, we calculate the Attributable Risk among the Exposed, $AR_e$:\n$$AR_e = I_e - I_u = 0.032 - 0.016 = 0.016$$\nNow, we calculate the expected number of attributable cases, $E[AC_e]$:\n$$E[AC_e] = N_e \\times AR_e = 12{,}500 \\times 0.016$$\n$$E[AC_e] = 12{,}500 \\times \\frac{16}{1000} = \\frac{200{,}000}{1000} = 200$$\nThus, the expected number of cases among the exposed that are attributable to the exposure is $200$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{200}$$", "id": "4544877"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of attributable risk for harmful exposures, we now shift our perspective to beneficial ones, such as vaccinations or healthy behaviors.

It is scientifically grounded in standard epidemiological principles, well-posed with sufficient data for a unique solution, and expressed in objective, precise language. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or scientifically implausible claims. We may therefore proceed with a full derivation and analysis.\n\nFirst, we calculate the fundamental epidemiological measures from the provided data.\nThe number of persons in the immunized (exposed) group is $N_1 = 3,000$, with $I_1 = 360$ incident cases of influenza.\nThe number of persons in the non-immunized (unexposed) group is $N_0 = 2,500$, with $I_0 = 500$ incident cases.\n\nThe risk in the exposed group, $R_1$, is the proportion of exposed individuals who develop the outcome:\n$$R_1 = \\frac{I_1}{N_1} = \\frac{360}{3,000} = 0.12$$\n\nThe risk in the unexposed group, $R_0$, is the proportion of unexposed individuals who develop the outcome:\n$$R_0 = \\frac{I_0}{N_0} = \\frac{500}{2,500} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.20$$\n\nUsing these risks, we can calculate the risk difference ($RD$) and the relative risk ($RR$).\nThe risk difference is defined as $RD = R_1 - R_0$:\n$$RD = 0.12 - 0.20 = -0.08$$\n\nThe relative risk is defined as $RR = R_1 / R_0$:\n$$RR = \\frac{0.12}{0.20} = \\frac{12}{20} = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.60$$\nSince $RR < 1$, the exposure (immunization) is protective.\n\nNext, we formalize the definitions of the attributable and prevented fractions based on the problem description.\nThe attributable fraction among the exposed ($AF_e$) is given by the formula for a harmful exposure:\n$$AF_e = \\frac{R_1 - R_0}{R_1}$$\nUsing the calculated values:\n$$AF_e = \\frac{0.12 - 0.20}{0.12} = \\frac{-0.08}{0.12} = -\\frac{8}{12} = -\\frac{2}{3} \\approx -0.667$$\n\nThe prevented fraction among the exposed ($PF_e$) is defined as \"the proportion of potential risk prevented by the exposure among those exposed\". The potential risk for the exposed, had they not been exposed, is estimated by $R_0$. The actual risk is $R_1$. The amount of risk prevented is thus $R_0 - R_1$. The proportion of potential risk prevented is this amount relative to the potential risk, $R_0$.\n$$PF_e = \\frac{R_0 - R_1}{R_0} = 1 - \\frac{R_1}{R_0} = 1 - RR$$\nUsing the calculated $RR$:\n$$PF_e = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$$\n\nNow we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. The risk difference equals $-0.08$, and because it is negative, it equals the prevented fraction among the exposed.**\nThe first part of this statement is correct: we calculated $RD = -0.08$. However, the second part claims that this value equals the prevented fraction among the exposed, $PF_e$. We calculated $PF_e = 0.40$. Numerically, $-0.08 \\neq 0.40$. Conceptually, the risk difference ($RD$) is an absolute measure of risk reduction, while the prevented fraction ($PF_e$) is a relative measure, specifically the reduction in risk relative to the baseline risk in the unexposed ($R_0$). They are not the same quantity. The reasoning \"because it is negative, it equals...\" is a non-sequitur.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. The prevented fraction among the exposed equals $1 - RR$; numerically it is $0.40$ in this dataset.**\nAs derived from the conceptual definition provided in the problem, the formula for the prevented fraction among the exposed is indeed $PF_e = (R_0 - R_1) / R_0 = 1 - R_1/R_0 = 1 - RR$. Our calculation using the dataset yields $PF_e = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$. Both the formula and the numerical result stated in the option are correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. If one uses the standard harmful-exposure definition of the attributable fraction among the exposed, $(R_1 - R_0)/R_1$, then its value is $-0.40$ and it equals the negative of the prevented fraction among the exposed.**\nThe statement makes two claims. First, that the value of $AF_e = (R_1 - R_0)/R_1$ is $-0.40$. Our calculation showed $AF_e = -0.08 / 0.12 = -2/3 \\approx -0.667$. The value $-0.40$ is incorrect. Second, it claims that $AF_e = -PF_e$. Our calculated values are $AF_e \\approx -0.667$ and $PF_e = 0.40$, so $-PF_e = -0.40$. These are not equal. Algebraically, $AF_e = (R_1 - R_0)/R_1$ while $-PF_e = -(R_0 - R_1)/R_0 = (R_1-R_0)/R_0$. The equality $(R_1-R_0)/R_1 = (R_1-R_0)/R_0$ would only hold if $R_1=R_0$ (in which case the numerators are zero) or if the numerators are non-zero and $R_1=R_0$, which is a contradiction. Since $R_1 \\neq R_0$, the claim is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. When $RR < 1$, the relationship between the attributable fraction among the exposed and the prevented fraction among the exposed is $AF_e = - PF_e / RR$; numerically here $-0.40 / 0.60 = -0.667$.**\nLet's verify the algebraic relationship. The right-hand side is $-PF_e / RR$. We substitute the definitions:\n$$-\\frac{PF_e}{RR} = -\\frac{(R_0 - R_1) / R_0}{R_1 / R_0} = -\\frac{R_0 - R_1}{R_1} = \\frac{R_1 - R_0}{R_1}$$\nThis is exactly the definition of $AF_e$. Thus, the relationship $AF_e = -PF_e / RR$ is correct.\nNow, let's verify the numerical part. The option states the calculation as $-0.40 / 0.60 = -0.667$.\nHere, $PF_e = 0.40$ and $RR = 0.60$, so the calculation is $-PF_e / RR$.\n$-0.40 / 0.60 = -4/6 = -2/3 \\approx -0.666...$, which is correctly rounded to $-0.667$. This value matches our direct calculation of $AF_e$. The statement is entirely correct, both in its algebraic relationship and its numerical application to this dataset.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. If the exposure prevalence in the source population is $0.50$, then the population prevented fraction (the proportion of potential cases prevented in the entire population relative to a counterfactual with no one exposed) equals $0.20$.**\nLet $P_e$ be the prevalence of the exposure in the population, given as $P_e = 0.50$.\nThe overall risk in the population, $R_p$, is a weighted average of the risks in the exposed and unexposed subgroups:\n$$R_p = R_1 \\cdot P_e + R_0 \\cdot (1 - P_e)$$\nNumerically:\n$$R_p = (0.12)(0.50) + (0.20)(1 - 0.50) = 0.06 + (0.20)(0.50) = 0.06 + 0.10 = 0.16$$\nThe \"counterfactual\" risk, if no one were exposed, is $R_0 = 0.20$.\nThe Population Prevented Fraction ($PF_p$) is the proportion of potential cases prevented, defined as $(R_0 - R_p) / R_0$.\n$$PF_p = \\frac{R_0 - R_p}{R_0} = \\frac{0.20 - 0.16}{0.20} = \\frac{0.04}{0.20} = \\frac{4}{20} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.20$$\nThe statement claims the value is $0.20$, which matches our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, we can derive a general formula for $PF_p$:\n$$PF_p = \\frac{R_0 - R_p}{R_0} = \\frac{R_0 - (R_1 P_e + R_0(1-P_e))}{R_0} = \\frac{R_0 - R_1 P_e - R_0 + R_0 P_e}{R_0} = \\frac{P_e(R_0-R_1)}{R_0} = P_e \\left(\\frac{R_0-R_1}{R_0}\\right) = P_e \\cdot PF_e$$\nUsing this relationship, $PF_p = P_e \\cdot PF_e = (0.50)(0.40) = 0.20$. This confirms the result.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BDE}$$", "id": "4544810"}, {"introduction": "In real-world epidemiological studies, the relationship between an exposure and an outcome is often complicated by other factors, or covariates, that can confound the results.
