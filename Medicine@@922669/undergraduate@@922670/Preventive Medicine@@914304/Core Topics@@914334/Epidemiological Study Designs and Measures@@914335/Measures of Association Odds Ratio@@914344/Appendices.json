The scenario of a foodborne outbreak investigation is a classic application of these principles. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The data provided is complete and consistent, allowing for the construction of a standard $2 \\times 2$ contingency table.

It is a standard, well-posed problem in biostatistics and epidemiology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires the calculation and comparison of the risk ratio (RR) and odds ratio (OR) from a cohort study of an outbreak. We begin by organizing the provided data into a standard $2 \\times 2$ contingency table, where 'Exposed' refers to eating the dessert and 'Ill' refers to developing gastrointestinal illness.\n\nLet the cell counts be denoted as follows:\n-   $a$: Exposed and Ill\n-   $b$: Exposed and Not Ill\n-   $c$: Unexposed and Ill\n-   $d$: Unexposed and Not Ill\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n-   $a = 80$\n-   $b = 20$\n-   $c = 40$\n-   $d = 60$\n\nThe total number of individuals in the exposed group is $N_E = a + b = 80 + 20 = 100$.\nThe total number of individuals in the unexposed group is $N_{U} = c + d = 40 + 60 = 100$.\n\n#### 1. Compute Risk and Odds in Each Group\n\n**Exposed Group:**\n-   **Risk of illness (Cumulative Incidence)**: This is the proportion of exposed individuals who became ill. Let this be $R_E$.\n    $$R_E = \\frac{a}{a+b} = \\frac{80}{100} = 0.8$$\n-   **Odds of illness**: This is the ratio of the probability of becoming ill to the probability of not becoming ill within the exposed group. The probability of illness is $p_E = \\frac{a}{a+b}$. The probability of not being ill is $1-p_E = \\frac{b}{a+b}$.\n    $$O_E = \\frac{p_E}{1-p_E} = \\frac{a/(a+b)}{b/(a+b)} = \\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{80}{20} = 4$$\n\n**Unexposed Group:**\n-   **Risk of illness (Cumulative Incidence)**: This is the proportion of unexposed individuals who became ill. Let this be $R_U$.\n    $$R_U = \\frac{c}{c+d} = \\frac{40}{100} = 0.4$$\n-   **Odds of illness**: Similar to the exposed group, the odds of illness among the unexposed is the ratio of the probability of becoming ill to the probability of not becoming ill. The probability of illness is $p_U = \\frac{c}{c+d}$.\n    $$O_U = \\frac{p_U}{1-p_U} = \\frac{c/(c+d)}{d/(c+d)} = \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{40}{60} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\n#### 2. Compute the Risk Ratio and Odds Ratio\n\n-   **Risk Ratio (RR)**: The ratio of the risk in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group.\n    $$RR = \\frac{R_E}{R_U} = \\frac{0.8}{0.4} = 2.0$$\n-   **Odds Ratio (OR)**: The ratio of the odds of illness in the exposed group to the odds of illness in the unexposed group. This can also be calculated as the cross-product ratio from the $2 \\times 2$ table.\n    $$OR = \\frac{O_E}{O_U} = \\frac{4}{2/3} = 4 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 6.0$$\n    Alternatively, using the cross-product:\n    $$OR = \\frac{ad}{bc} = \\frac{80 \\times 60}{20 \\times 40} = \\frac{4800}{800} = 6.0$$\n\n#### 3. Explain the Divergence of Risk Ratio and Odds Ratio\n\nThe divergence between the risk ratio (RR) and the odds ratio (OR) is a direct consequence of their mathematical definitions, particularly when the outcome is not rare.\n\nLet $p_1$ be the risk in the exposed group ($R_E$) and $p_0$ be the risk in the unexposed group ($R_U$).\nBy definition, the odds for a given risk $p$ is $O = \\frac{p}{1-p}$.\nThe risk ratio is:\n$$RR = \\frac{p_1}{p_0}$$\nThe odds ratio is:\n$$OR = \\frac{O_1}{O_0} = \\frac{p_1/(1-p_1)}{p_0/(1-p_0)} = \\frac{p_1}{p_0} \\times \\frac{1-p_0}{1-p_1}$$\nSubstituting the RR definition into the OR equation, we get the relationship:\n$$OR = RR \\times \\frac{1-p_0}{1-p_1}$$\nThe RR and OR are equal only if the term $\\frac{1-p_0}{1-p_1}$ is equal to $1$. This happens only if $p_0 = p_1$ (in which case both RR and OR are $1$) or in the trivial case where the risks are $0$.\n\nWhen the outcome is rare, both $p_1$ and $p_0$ are very close to $0$. In this scenario, $1-p_1 \\approx 1$ and $1-p_0 \\approx 1$, so the factor $\\frac{1-p_0}{1-p_1} \\approx 1$. Consequently, for rare outcomes, $OR \\approx RR$. This is known as the rare disease assumption.\n\nIn the given dataset, the outcome is common. The risk of illness is high in both groups: $p_1 = 0.8$ and $p_0 = 0.4$. These values are far from $0$. Therefore, the term $(1 - p_1)$ is $1 - 0.8 = 0.2$, and the term $(1 - p_0)$ is $1 - 0.4 = 0.6$. The correction factor is $\\frac{1-p_0}{1-p_1} = \\frac{0.6}{0.2} = 3$.\n\nThis factor is significantly different from $1$, which causes the OR to diverge from the RR. Specifically, $OR = RR \\times 3 = 2 \\times 3 = 6$. The odds ratio overestimates the magnitude of the association compared to the risk ratio when the outcome is common and the exposure increases the risk ($p_1>p_0$). This is because the odds ($p/(1-p)$) increase non-linearly and faster than the risk ($p$) as $p$ grows.\n\n#### 4. Final Numerical Values\nThe computed values are $RR = 2.0$ and $OR = 6.0$. Rounded to three significant figures, these are $2.00$ and $6.00$. The problem asks for the pair of final numerical values for the risk ratio and the odds ratio, in that order.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2.00 & 6.00 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4545209"}, {"introduction": "Real-world associations are rarely simple; they are often influenced by other factors known as confounders.

There are no scientific, factual, or logical flaws.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe odds ratio ($OR$) for a single stratum in a case-control study is defined as the odds of exposure among cases divided by the odds of exposure among controls. Using the standard table structure:\n- Odds of exposure among cases = $\\frac{a_i}{c_i}$\n- Odds of exposure among controls = $\\frac{b_i}{d_i}$\n\nThe stratum-specific odds ratio, $OR_i$, is the ratio of these odds:\n$$OR_i = \\frac{a_i/c_i}{b_i/d_i} = \\frac{a_i d_i}{b_i c_i}$$\n\nTo obtain a single, summary estimate of the odds ratio that controls for the confounding effect of the stratification variable (age), the Mantel-Haenszel ($MH$) pooled estimator is appropriate. The formula for the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio, $OR_{MH}$, is:\n$$OR_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{a_i d_i}{N_i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{b_i c_i}{N_i}}$$\nwhere $k$ is the number of strata and $N_i = a_i + b_i + c_i + d_i$ is the total number of subjects in stratum $i$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the necessary components for each stratum.\n\n**For Stratum 1 (ages 20–39):**\nThe counts are $a_1 = 72$, $b_1 = 240$, $c_1 = 128$, and $d_1 = 560$.\nThe total number of subjects is $N_1 = 72 + 240 + 128 + 560 = 1000$.\nThe weighted numerator component is $\\frac{a_1 d_1}{N_1} = \\frac{72 \\times 560}{1000} = \\frac{40320}{1000} = 40.32$.\nThe weighted denominator component is $\\frac{b_1 c_1}{N_1} = \\frac{240 \\times 128}{1000} = \\frac{30720}{1000} = 30.72$.\nThe stratum-specific odds ratio is $OR_1 = \\frac{a_1 d_1}{b_1 c_1} = \\frac{40320}{30720} = 1.3125$.\n\n**For Stratum 2 (ages 40–59):**\nThe counts are $a_2 = 195$, $b_2 = 180$, $c_2 = 100$, and $d_2 = 120$.\nThe total number of subjects is $N_2 = 195 + 180 + 100 + 120 = 595$.\nThe weighted numerator component is $\\frac{a_2 d_2}{N_2} = \\frac{195 \\times 120}{595} = \\frac{23400}{595}$.\nThe weighted denominator component is $\\frac{b_2 c_2}{N_2} = \\frac{180 \\times 100}{595} = \\frac{18000}{595}$.\nThe stratum-specific odds ratio is $OR_2 = \\frac{a_2 d_2}{b_2 c_2} = \\frac{23400}{18000} = 1.3$.\n\nThe stratum-specific odds ratios ($OR_1 = 1.3125$ and $OR_2 = 1.3$) are very similar, suggesting that the odds ratio is homogeneous across strata and that the Mantel-Haenszel estimator is an appropriate summary measure.\n\n**Calculation of the Age-Adjusted (Mantel-Haenszel) Odds Ratio:**\nWe sum the weighted components from each stratum to compute $OR_{MH}$:\n$$OR_{MH} = \\frac{\\frac{a_1 d_1}{N_1} + \\frac{a_2 d_2}{N_2}}{\\frac{b_1 c_1}{N_1} + \\frac{b_2 c_2}{N_2}} = \\frac{40.32 + \\frac{23400}{595}}{30.72 + \\frac{18000}{595}}$$\nTo perform the calculation with precision:\n$$OR_{MH} = \\frac{\\frac{40320}{1000} + \\frac{23400}{595}}{\\frac{30720}{1000} + \\frac{18000}{595}} = \\frac{\\frac{40320 \\times 595 + 23400 \\times 1000}{1000 \\times 595}}{\\frac{30720 \\times 595 + 18000 \\times 1000}{1000 \\times 595}} = \\frac{23990400 + 23400000}{18278400 + 18000000}$$\n$$OR_{MH} = \\frac{47390400}{36278400} = \\frac{473904}{362784} \\approx 1.306306...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the age-adjusted odds ratio is $1.306$.\n\n**Calculation of the Crude Odds Ratio:**\nTo calculate the crude odds ratio ($OR_{Crude}$), we collapse the strata into a single $2 \\times 2$ table by summing the counts:\n- Total exposed cases: $A = a_1 + a_2 = 72 + 195 = 267$\n- Total exposed controls: $B = b_1 + b_2 = 240 + 180 = 420$\n- Total unexposed cases: $C = c_1 + c_2 = 128 + 100 = 228$\n- Total unexposed controls: $D = d_1 + d_2 = 560 + 120 = 680$\n\nThe crude odds ratio is:\n$$OR_{Crude} = \\frac{AD}{BC} = \\frac{267 \\times 680}{420 \\times 228} = \\frac{181560}{95760} \\approx 1.8960...$$\n\n**Comparison and Interpretation of Confounding:**\nThe crude odds ratio ($OR_{Crude} \\approx 1.896$) is substantially different from the age-adjusted Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio ($OR_{MH} \\approx 1.306$). This large difference confirms the presence of confounding by age. The crude measure overestimates the strength of the association between sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and type $2$ diabetes.\n\nConfounding occurs because age is associated with both the outcome (diabetes) and the exposure (beverage consumption). In this dataset:\n1.  Age is associated with diabetes: The prevalence of diabetes is higher in the older stratum (stratum $2$). For example, among the unexposed, the proportion of cases is $\\frac{c_1}{c_1+d_1} = \\frac{128}{128+560} \\approx 0.186$ in the younger group, versus $\\frac{c_2}{c_2+d_2} = \\frac{100}{100+120} \\approx 0.455$ in the older group.\n2.  Age is associated with exposure: The prevalence of exposure is also higher in the older stratum. Among the controls, the proportion of exposed is $\\frac{b_1}{b_1+d_1} = \\frac{240}{240+560} = 0.3$ in the younger group, versus $\\frac{b_2}{b_2+d_2} = \\frac{180}{180+120} = 0.6$ in the older group.\n\nBecause the older age group has a higher prevalence of both diabetes and the exposure, simply collapsing the data (as is done for the crude OR) incorrectly attributes some of the effect of age on diabetes risk to the exposure, thus artificially inflating the estimate of the association. The stratification and subsequent calculation of the Mantel-Haenszel OR adjusts for this distortion, providing a more accurate estimate of the exposure-disease relationship, which is approximately $1.306$.\n\nThe problem asks only for the age-adjusted pooled odds ratio.\nThe calculated value is $OR_{MH} \\approx 1.306306...$.\nRounding to four significant figures gives $1.306$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.306}$$", "id": "4545215"}, {"introduction": "A calculated odds ratio is only a point estimate from a sample, and it's essential to quantify the uncertainty surrounding it.
