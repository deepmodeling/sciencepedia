The question asks for the identification of valid adjustment sets based on a clearly stated criterion (the backdoor criterion).

The definitions and relationships are objective and do not rely on subjective interpretation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe goal is to identify all adjustment sets that allow for an unbiased estimation of the causal effect of $E$ on $D$. This requires using the backdoor criterion to identify and block all non-causal (backdoor) paths from $E$ to $D$ without creating new spurious associations by conditioning on colliders.\n\n**1. Construct the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**\n\nBased on the provided causal relations, the causal path of interest is the direct arrow $E \\to D$. The other relationships form the structure around this path.\n\n**2. Identify All Paths Between $E$ and $D$**\n\nWe must list all paths connecting $E$ and $D$, ignoring the direction of the arrows for a moment, to identify backdoor paths and paths with colliders.\n\n- **Path 1 (Causal Path):** $E \\to D$. This is the direct causal effect we wish to estimate. We must not block this path.\n\n- **Path 2 (Backdoor Path):** $E \\leftarrow C \\to D$. This is a non-causal path connecting $E$ and $D$. An arrow points into $E$ ($E \\leftarrow C$), making it a backdoor path. The variable $C$ is a common cause of both $E$ and $D$. Since this path does not contain a collider, it is an open path that creates a spurious association between $E$ and $D$. This is confounding by age, $C$. To obtain an unbiased estimate of the effect of $E$ on $D$, this path must be blocked by conditioning on $C$.\n\n- **Path 3 (Collider Path):** $E \\to S \\leftarrow U \\to D$. This is another non-causal path connecting $E$ and $D$. On this path, the variable $S$ has two arrows pointing into it ($E \\to S$ and $U \\to S$). Therefore, $S$ is a collider. A path containing an unconditioned collider is naturally blocked. This path does not create a spurious association between $E$ and $D$ unless we condition on the collider $S$ (or a descendant of $S$). Conditioning on $S$ would *open* this path and induce a non-causal association between $E$ and $D$, a phenomenon known as collider bias or M-bias.\n\n**3. Apply the Backdoor Criterion**\n\nA set of variables $Z$ is a valid adjustment set if it satisfies two conditions:\n1. $Z$ blocks every backdoor path between $E$ and $D$.\n2. $Z$ does not open any blocked paths (i.e., $Z$ does not contain any colliders on paths between $E$ and $D$, or their descendants).\n\nIn our DAG, there is only one backdoor path ($E \\leftarrow C \\to D$). Therefore, any valid adjustment set must block this path. The only way to block this path is to condition on $C$.\nFurthermore, any valid adjustment set must not condition on the collider $S$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each proposed adjustment set.\n\n**A. Adjust for $C$ only.**\nThe adjustment set is $Z = \\{C\\}$.\n- Does it block the backdoor path $E \\leftarrow C \\to D$? Yes, because $C \\in Z$.\n- Does it condition on the collider $S$? No.\nTherefore, this set blocks all backdoor paths without inducing collider bias.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Adjust for $S$ only.**\nThe adjustment set is $Z = \\{S\\}$.\n- Does it block the backdoor path $E \\leftarrow C \\to D$? No, because $C \\notin Z$.\n- Does it condition on the collider $S$? Yes. This induces collider bias by opening the path $E \\to S \\leftarrow U \\to D$.\nTherefore, this set is invalid on two counts.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Adjust for $C$ and $U$.**\nThe adjustment set is $Z = \\{C, U\\}$.\n- Does it block the backdoor path $E \\leftarrow C \\to D$? Yes, because $C \\in Z$.\n- Does it condition on the collider $S$? No.\nThis set successfully blocks the confounding path through $C$ and does not induce collider bias. The variable $U$ is not a confounder of the $E$-$D$ relationship (as there is no path from $U$ to $E$). While adjusting for $U$ is not necessary to control for confounding, its inclusion does not violate the backdoor criterion. The set $\\{C, U\\}$ remains a valid adjustment set.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Adjust for $C$ and $S$.**\nThe adjustment set is $Z = \\{C, S\\}$.\n- Does it block the backdoor path $E \\leftarrow C \\to D$? Yes, because $C \\in Z$.\n- Does it condition on the collider $S$? Yes. This induces collider bias.\nBecause this set includes the collider $S$, it is an invalid adjustment set.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. No adjustment.**\nThe adjustment set is the empty set, $Z = \\emptyset$.\n- Does it block the backdoor path $E \\leftarrow C \\to D$? No.\nTherefore, confounding due to $C$ is not controlled for.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the analysis, two of the proposed sets, $\\{C\\}$ and $\\{C, U\\}$, are valid adjustment sets that eliminate confounding without inducing collider bias.

Compute the crude (unadjusted) risks and crude risk difference.**\n\nThe crude risk for each exposure group is a weighted average of the stratum-specific risks, where the weights are the prevalences of $C$ within that exposure group.\n\nFirst, we determine the prevalence of $C$ within each exposure group from the given sample sizes.\nFor the exposed group ($A=1$):\n$$P(C=0 | A=1) = \\frac{N_{10}}{N_1} = \\frac{100}{1000} = 0.1$$\n$$P(C=1 | A=1) = \\frac{N_{11}}{N_1} = \\frac{900}{1000} = 0.9$$\n\nFor the unexposed group ($A=0$):\n$$P(C=0 | A=0) = \\frac{N_{00}}{N_0} = \\frac{900}{1000} = 0.9$$\n$$P(C=1 | A=0) = \\frac{N_{01}}{N_0} = \\frac{100}{1000} = 0.1$$\n\nNow, we compute the crude risks using the law of total probability.\nCrude risk for $A=1$:\n$$P(Y=1 | A=1) = P(Y=1 | A=1, C=0)P(C=0 | A=1) + P(Y=1 | A=1, C=1)P(C=1 | A=1)$$\n$$P(Y=1 | A=1) = (0.05)(0.1) + (0.20)(0.9) = 0.005 + 0.18 = 0.185$$\n\nCrude risk for $A=0$:\n$$P(Y=1 | A=0) = P(Y=1 | A=0, C=0)P(C=0 | A=0) + P(Y=1 | A=0, C=1)P(C=1 | A=0)$$\n$$P(Y=1 | A=0) = (0.10)(0.9) + (0.30)(0.1) = 0.09 + 0.03 = 0.120$$\n\nThe crude risk difference ($RD_{crude}$) is:\n$$RD_{crude} = P(Y=1 | A=1) - P(Y=1 | A=0) = 0.185 - 0.120 = 0.065$$\nThe crude analysis suggests the intervention increases risk, which is a reversal of the stratum-specific findings.

A variable $C$ is known from prior evidence to be associated with both $E$ and $D$ and is not on the causal pathway from $E$ to $D$. Therefore, $C$ is a plausible confounder by the core definition of confounding: a confounder is a variable associated with the exposure and the outcome that is not an intermediate on the causal path from exposure to outcome. To control confounding by $C$ at the design stage, the investigators implement matching on $C$ and then, at the analysis stage, they will use stratification by the matched sets to compute a pooled causal effect measure. The following outlines the matching design:\n\n- Define strata by levels of $C$ and, within each stratum, match exposed participants to unexposed participants with the same level of $C$ at baseline.\n- Allow variable matching ratios across strata to maintain feasibility while preserving exchangeability on $C$ within strata.\n- Follow all participants for the same fixed duration and record incident $D$.\n\nAfter follow-up, the data across $4$ matched strata defined on $C$ are summarized by the numbers of exposed and unexposed persons and cases of $D$. Let $a_i$ denote the number of cases among the exposed in stratum $i$, $b_i$ the number of non-cases among the exposed in stratum $i$, $c_i$ the number of cases among the unexposed in stratum $i$, and $d_i$ the number of non-cases among the unexposed in stratum $i$. Let $n_{1i} = a_i + b_i$ be the exposed total, $n_{0i} = c_i + d_i$ the unexposed total, and $n_i = n_{1i} + n_{0i}$ the stratum total.

The stratification is performed on a confounder, $C$.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental quantities for each stratum $i$, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The problem provides the counts of cases and non-cases for exposed and unexposed groups within each stratum.\nLet $a_i$ be the cases among the exposed, $n_{1i}$ the total number of exposed individuals, $c_i$ the cases among the unexposed, and $n_{0i}$ the total number of unexposed individuals.\n\nAccording to the fundamental definition of risk as the proportion of cases in a group, the risk in the exposed group for stratum $i$ is:\n$$ R_{1i} = \\frac{a_i}{n_{1i}} $$\nAnd the risk in the unexposed group for stratum $i$ is:\n$$ R_{0i} = \\frac{c_i}{n_{0i}} $$\nThe risk ratio ($RR$) for stratum $i$ is the ratio of these two risks:\n$$ RR_i = \\frac{R_{1i}}{R_{0i}} = \\frac{a_i / n_{1i}}{c_i / n_{0i}} $$\nThe study design uses matching on $C$ and stratification in the analysis to control for confounding by $C$. This means we are comparing \"like with like\" within each stratum. To obtain a single summary measure of effect across all strata, we must pool the stratum-specific information. This procedure assumes that the true underlying risk ratio is constant across all strata (i.e., no effect modification by $C$).\n\nThe standard and most widely used method for obtaining a pooled risk ratio from stratified data is the Mantel-Haenszel (MH) estimator. The derivation of this estimator from first principles involves weighting the stratum-specific information to form a summary estimate. The structure of the MH estimator for the risk ratio, $RR_{MH}$, is a sum of weighted numerator components divided by a sum of weighted denominator components from each stratum's $2 \\times 2$ table.\n\nThe formula for the Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio is:\n$$ RR_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{a_i n_{0i}}{n_i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{c_i n_{1i}}{n_i}} $$\nwhere $k$ is the number of strata ($k=4$ in this problem), and $n_i = n_{1i} + n_{0i}$ is the total number of participants in stratum $i$. This estimator can be understood as a weighted average of the stratum-specific risk ratios, $RR_i$, where the weights, $w_i = \\frac{c_i n_{1i}}{n_i}$, are chosen for their desirable statistical properties, ensuring a stable and consistent estimate even with sparse data in some strata. The formula directly pools the cross-product terms from each stratum, weighted by the inverse of the total stratum size, to create an overall adjusted estimate.\n\nWe now apply this formula to the provided data. We will calculate the numerator term, $\\frac{a_i n_{0i}}{n_i}$, and the denominator term, $\\frac{c_i n_{1i}}{n_i}$, for each of the $4$ strata.\n\n**Stratum 1:**\n$a_1 = 24$, $c_1 = 18$, $n_{1,1} = 120$, $n_{0,1} = 180$.\nTotal size: $n_1 = 120 + 180 = 300$.\nNumerator term: $\\frac{a_1 n_{0,1}}{n_1} = \\frac{24 \\times 180}{300} = \\frac{4320}{300} = 14.4$.\nDenominator term: $\\frac{c_1 n_{1,1}}{n_1} = \\frac{18 \\times 120}{300} = \\frac{2160}{300} = 7.2$.\n\n**Stratum 2:**\n$a_2 = 12$, $c_2 = 20$, $n_{1,2} = 80$, $n_{0,2} = 80$.\nTotal size: $n_2 = 80 + 80 = 160$.\nNumerator term: $\\frac{a_2 n_{0,2}}{n_2} = \\frac{12 \\times 80}{160} = \\frac{960}{160} = 6$.\nDenominator term: $\\frac{c_2 n_{1,2}}{n_2} = \\frac{20 \\times 80}{160} = \\frac{1600}{160} = 10$.\n\n**Stratum 3:**\n$a_3 = 9$, $c_3 = 12$, $n_{1,3} = 60$, $n_{0,3} = 120$.\nTotal size: $n_3 = 60 + 120 = 180$.\nNumerator term: $\\frac{a_3 n_{0,3}}{n_3} = \\frac{9 \\times 120}{180} = \\frac{1080}{180} = 6$.\nDenominator term: $\\frac{c_3 n_{1,3}}{n_3} = \\frac{12 \\times 60}{180} = \\frac{720}{180} = 4$.\n\n**Stratum 4:**\n$a_4 = 21$, $c_4 = 14$, $n_{1,4} = 140$, $n_{0,4} = 70$.\nTotal size: $n_4 = 140 + 70 = 210$.\nNumerator term: $\\frac{a_4 n_{0,4}}{n_4} = \\frac{21 \\times 70}{210} = \\frac{1470}{210} = 7$.\nDenominator term: $\\frac{c_4 n_{1,4}}{n_4} = \\frac{14 \\times 140}{210} = \\frac{1960}{210} = \\frac{196}{21} = \\frac{28}{3}$.\n\nNow, we sum the numerator and denominator terms across all strata.\nSum of numerator terms:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\frac{a_i n_{0i}}{n_i} = 14.4 + 6 + 6 + 7 = 33.4 $$\nSum of denominator terms:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\frac{c_i n_{1i}}{n_i} = 7.2 + 10 + 4 + \\frac{28}{3} = 21.2 + \\frac{28}{3} $$\nTo compute this sum exactly, we use fractions:\n$$ 21.2 + \\frac{28}{3} = \\frac{212}{10} + \\frac{28}{3} = \\frac{106}{5} + \\frac{28}{3} = \\frac{106 \\times 3}{15} + \\frac{28 \\times 5}{15} = \\frac{318 + 140}{15} = \\frac{458}{15} $$\nFinally, we compute the Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio:\n$$ RR_{MH} = \\frac{33.4}{\\frac{458}{15}} = \\frac{\\frac{334}{10}}{\\frac{458}{15}} = \\frac{167}{5} \\times \\frac{15}{458} = \\frac{167 \\times 3}{458} = \\frac{501}{458} $$\nTo obtain the numerical value, we perform the division:\n$$ RR_{MH} = \\frac{501}{458} \\approx 1.09388646... $$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$ RR_{MH} \\approx 1.094 $$\nThis value represents the estimated risk ratio for the effect of exposure $E$ on outcome $D$, adjusted for the confounding effect of variable $C$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.094}$$", "id": "4515349"}]}
