This exercise introduces 'immortal time bias,' a significant pitfall that occurs when the event-free time before an exposure begins is incorrectly handled. By calculating the biased rate ratio, you will see firsthand how this misclassification can create a misleading appearance of a protective effect, a crucial lesson for critically evaluating evidence in preventive medicine [@problem_id:4555122].", "problem": "A public health team conducts an observational cohort study to estimate the effect of a prophylactic drug on all-cause mortality over one year. The cohort consists of $500$ individuals newly diagnosed with a chronic condition, each followed from cohort entry (day $0$) until death or day $365$, whichever occurs first. Some individuals initiate the drug after a delay; initiation times vary across individuals. Investigators are aware that the period between cohort entry and drug initiation for those who eventually initiate treatment is event-free by construction among initiators, because an individual must survive to be observed as exposed. This event-free period is often referred to as immortal time.\n\nThe foundational starting points for the analysis are:\n- The incidence rate is defined as the number of events divided by the accrued person-time.\n- The rate ratio is defined as the ratio of the exposed incidence rate to the unexposed incidence rate.\n- Person-time (PT) is the sum over individuals of the time each person is at risk within a specified exposure category.\n\nThe study records the following aggregated data:\n- Among $240$ drug initiators, the sum of pre-initiation person-time is $24{,}000$ person-days, and the sum of post-initiation person-time is $62{,}400$ person-days. There are $48$ deaths that occur after initiation among these initiators. By construction, there are $0$ deaths during the pre-initiation period among initiators.\n- Among $260$ never-initiators, the accrued person-time is $73{,}000$ person-days, during which $110$ deaths occur.\n\nConsider two classification schemes:\n1. Correct classification: pre-initiation person-time for initiators is considered unexposed; post-initiation person-time is considered exposed; never-initiators contribute only unexposed person-time.\n2. Misclassification with immortal time bias (Immortal Time Bias (ITB)): pre-initiation person-time for initiators is incorrectly counted as exposed person-time.\n\nExplain briefly what immortal time bias is and, using the notion of individual timelines partitioned into pre-initiation and post-initiation segments for initiators, justify qualitatively why misclassifying the pre-initiation segment as exposed inflates exposed person-time and tends to bias the rate ratio toward protection. Then, under the misclassification scheme described in item $2$, compute the biased rate ratio as a decimal. Express the final answer without units and round to four significant figures.", "solution": "The analysis begins from core definitions. The incidence rate for a given exposure category is the number of events divided by the total accrued person-time in that category. The rate ratio (RR) is the exposed incidence rate divided by the unexposed incidence rate. Person-time (PT) is calculated by summing, over all individuals, the amount of time each individual is at risk within the specified exposure category.\n\nImmortal time bias (ITB) arises when a period during which the outcome cannot occur (the \"immortal\" period) is misclassified with respect to exposure, typically in observational pharmacoepidemiology. In this context, for initiators, the timeline can be partitioned into two segments: pre-initiation and post-initiation. The pre-initiation segment is immortal with respect to death for initiators, because to be classified as exposed at some later time, an individual must have survived up to the initiation date; hence, no death can occur in the pre-initiation segment among those who eventually initiate. If this pre-initiation, event-free segment is incorrectly counted as exposed, the exposed person-time is inflated without adding events, lowering the exposed incidence rate. Simultaneously, removing this event-free time from the unexposed category raises the unexposed incidence rate (the numerator remains the same while the denominator decreases). Together, these changes bias the RR, $RR=\\text{rate}_{\\text{exposed}}/\\text{rate}_{\\text{unexposed}}$, downward toward apparent protection.\n\nWe now compute the biased rate ratio under the misclassification scheme in item $2$.\n\nFirst, define the observed totals:\n- For initiators: pre-initiation PT is $24{,}000$ person-days, post-initiation PT is $62{,}400$ person-days, and deaths post-initiation are $48$; deaths pre-initiation among initiators are $0$.\n- For never-initiators: PT is $73{,}000$ person-days, with $110$ deaths.\n\nUnder misclassification with ITB:\n- Exposed PT is the sum of post-initiation PT and misclassified pre-initiation PT among initiators:\n$$\n\\text{PT}_{E,\\text{mis}} = 62{,}400 + 24{,}000 = 86{,}400.\n$$\n- Exposed deaths are those occurring after initiation among initiators:\n$$\nD_{E,\\text{mis}} = 48.\n$$\nThus the exposed incidence rate under misclassification is\n$$\n\\text{rate}_{E,\\text{mis}} = \\frac{D_{E,\\text{mis}}}{\\text{PT}_{E,\\text{mis}}} = \\frac{48}{86{,}400} = \\frac{1}{1{,}800}.\n$$\n\n- Unexposed PT excludes the pre-initiation time of initiators (since it has been misclassified as exposed) and includes only the never-initiators:\n$$\n\\text{PT}_{U,\\text{mis}} = 73{,}000.\n$$\n- Unexposed deaths are those among never-initiators:\n$$\nD_{U,\\text{mis}} = 110.\n$$\nSo the unexposed incidence rate under misclassification is\n$$\n\\text{rate}_{U,\\text{mis}} = \\frac{D_{U,\\text{mis}}}{\\text{PT}_{U,\\text{mis}}} = \\frac{110}{73{,}000}.\n$$\n\nThe biased rate ratio is\n$$\nRR_{\\text{mis}} = \\frac{\\text{rate}_{E,\\text{mis}}}{\\text{rate}_{U,\\text{mis}}} = \\frac{\\frac{48}{86{,}400}}{\\frac{110}{73{,}000}}.\n$$\nCompute this fraction step by step:\n$$\nRR_{\\text{mis}} = \\frac{48}{86{,}400} \\times \\frac{73{,}000}{110} = \\frac{1}{1{,}800} \\times \\frac{73{,}000}{110} = \\frac{73{,}000}{198{,}000} = \\frac{73}{198}.\n$$\nAs a decimal,\n$$\nRR_{\\text{mis}} \\approx 0.3686868686\\ldots\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, the biased rate ratio is\n$$\n0.3687.\n$$\n\nFor completeness and to illustrate the direction of bias, one may compare to the correctly classified quantities.
