The total sample size is $n = n_1 + n_2 = 6$.\n\nThe pooled mean salt intake is $\\bar{X} = \\frac{2+3+4+7+8+9}{6} = \\frac{33}{6} = 5.5$ grams/day.\nThe pooled mean systolic blood pressure is $\\bar{Y} = \\frac{132+133+134+117+118+119}{6} = \\frac{753}{6} = 125.5$ mmHg.\n\nThe sum of squared deviations for $X$ for the pooled data is:\n$$ S_{XX} = (2-5.5)^2 + (3-5.5)^2 + (4-5.5)^2 + (7-5.5)^2 + (8-5.5)^2 + (9-5.5)^2 \\\\ = (-3.5)^2 + (-2.5)^2 + (-1.5)^2 + (1.5)^2 + (2.5)^2 + (3.5)^2 \\\\ = 12.25 + 6.25 + 2.25 + 2.25 + 6.25 + 12.25 = 41.5 $$\nThe sum of cross-products of deviations for the pooled data is:\n$$ S_{XY} = (2-5.5)(132-125.5) + (3-5.5)(133-125.5) + (4-5.5)(134-125.5) \\\\ + (7-5.5)(117-125.5) + (8-5.5)(118-125.5) + (9-5.5)(119-125.5) \\\\ = (-3.5)(6.5) + (-2.5)(7.5) + (-1.5)(8.5) + (1.5)(-8.5) + (2.5)(-7.5) + (3.5)(-6.5) \\\\ = -22.75 - 18.75 - 12.75 - 12.75 - 18.75 - 22.75 = -108.5 $$\nThe pooled OLS slope is:\n$$ \\hat{\\beta}_{1} = \\frac{S_{XY}}{S_{XX}} = \\frac{-108.5}{41.5} \\approx -2.614457... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the pooled slope is $\\hat{\\beta}_1 \\approx -2.614$.\n\n**3. Confounding Structure and Ecological Fallacy**\n\nThe analysis reveals a stark reversal in the association: the within-group slope is positive ($\\hat{\\beta}_{1}^{(G_1)} = \\hat{\\beta}_{1}^{(G_2)} = 1$), while the pooled slope is negative ($\\hat{\\beta}_{1} \\approx -2.614$). This reversal is a classic demonstration of Simpson's Paradox, caused by a confounding variable.\n\nThe confounding variable here is the age group. A confounder must be associated with both the exposure and the outcome.\n- **Association with Exposure ($X$):** The older group ($G_1$) has a lower mean salt intake ($\\bar{X}_1 = 3$) than the younger group ($G_2$), where $\\bar{X}_2 = 8$. Thus, age group is associated with salt intake.\n- **Association with Outcome ($Y$):** The older group ($G_1$) has a higher mean blood pressure ($\\bar{Y}_1 = 133$) than the younger group ($G_2$), where $\\bar{Y}_2 = 118$. This is consistent with the known physiological effect of aging on blood pressure.\n\nBecause age is associated with both salt intake and blood pressure, it confounds the relationship between them in the unstratified (pooled) analysis. The negative pooled slope is an artifact driven by the between-group differences: the group with lower exposure ($G_1$, older adults) has a higher average outcome, and the group with higher exposure ($G_2$, younger adults) has a lower average outcome. This strong negative association at the group level dominates the weaker positive association at the individual level within each group.\n\nThe **ecological fallacy** (or ecological inference error) would occur if one were to interpret the pooled (aggregate) result as representative of the individual-level effect. Concluding from the pooled slope $\\hat{\\beta}_1 < 0$ that increasing an individual's salt intake causes a decrease in their blood pressure is an erroneous inference. The stratified analysis, which controls for the confounder (age group), reveals the true underlying positive association at the individual level. Ecological studies, which analyze data at a group or population level, are particularly susceptible to this type of error.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-2.614}\n$$", "id": "4522048"}, {"introduction": "Now that we have seen how confounding can create misleading aggregate results, how can we make more valid comparisons between populations?

Interpret how differences illustrate ecological fallacy.**\n\nThe crude rate for Region A ($462.5$) is more than double the crude rate for Region B ($223.1$), with a crude rate ratio of approximately $2.07$. An uncritical examination of this aggregate data might lead to the conclusion that the overall mortality risk is substantially higher in Region A.\n\nHowever, a comparison of the age-specific mortality rates reveals the opposite: in every single age stratum, the mortality rate in Region A is lower than in Region B ($50 < 60$, $200 < 220$, $1500 < 1700$). This apparent contradiction is an example of Simpson's paradox.\n\nThe discrepancy arises because the crude rates are confounded by the different age structures of the two regions. Region A has a significantly older population (the proportion of people aged $\\geq 65$ is $\\frac{60{,}000}{240{,}000} = 25\\%$) compared to Region B (where the proportion is $\\frac{20{,}000}{260{,}000} \\approx 7.7\\%$). Since the mortality rate is highest in the oldest age group, the larger elderly population in Region A inflates its overall crude mortality rate, masking the lower mortality risk within each age group.\n\nThe ecological fallacy is the error of applying an inference drawn from aggregate (ecological level) data to individuals. Here, the fallacious inference would be to conclude that an individual in Region A has a higher mortality risk than an individual of the same age in Region B, based on the crude rate comparison.\n\nDirect standardization corrects for this confounding by applying a common age structure to both regions. The resulting standardized rate ratio, $RR_{std} \\approx 0.882$, shows that if the two regions had identical age distributions, Region A would have a mortality rate that is about $12\\%$ lower than Region B. This standardized comparison accurately reflects the relationship seen in the age-specific rates and avoids the ecological fallacy.\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\nThe problem asks for the absolute difference between the crude rate ratio and the directly standardized rate ratio, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$|RR_{crude} - RR_{std}| = |2.07327586\\dots - 0.88235294\\dots|$$\n$$|RR_{crude} - RR_{std}| = 1.19092292\\dots$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $1.191$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.191}$$", "id": "4522049"}, {"introduction": "The potential for ecological bias is not uniform across all datasets; it is most severe when individuals within groups are more similar to each other than to individuals in other groups.
