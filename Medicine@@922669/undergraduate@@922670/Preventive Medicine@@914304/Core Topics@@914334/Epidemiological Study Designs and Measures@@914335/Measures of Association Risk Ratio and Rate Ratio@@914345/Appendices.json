The given parameters are the cumulative incidence (risk) in the intervention group, $R_1$, and the cumulative incidence in the control group, $R_0$.\n\nThe provided values are:\n- Risk in the intervention group: $R_1 = 0.12$\n- Risk in the control group: $R_0 = 0.30$\n\nWe are tasked with computing three measures of association: the risk ratio (RR), the relative risk reduction (RRR), and the risk difference (RD), and discussing their complementary interpretations.\n\n1.  **Risk Ratio (RR)**\nThe risk ratio, also known as relative risk, is defined as the ratio of the risk in the intervention group to the risk in the control group. It quantifies the multiplicative effect of the intervention on the risk of the outcome.\nThe formula is:\n$$RR = \\frac{R_1}{R_0}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$RR = \\frac{0.12}{0.30} = 0.4$$\nAn $RR  1$ indicates that the intervention is protective, meaning it reduces the risk of the outcome. An $RR = 0.4$ signifies that the risk of influenza in the intervention group is $0.4$ times, or $40\\%$, of the risk in the control group.\n\n2.  **Relative Risk Reduction (RRR)**\nThe relative risk reduction measures the proportion by which the risk is reduced in the intervention group relative to the control group. It is derived from the risk ratio and is often expressed as a percentage, though here it is requested as a decimal.\nThe formula is:\n$$RRR = \\frac{R_0 - R_1}{R_0} = 1 - \\frac{R_1}{R_0} = 1 - RR$$\nUsing the previously calculated value of $RR$:\n$$RRR = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6$$\nThis means the prevention program reduced the risk of influenza by $60\\%$ compared to the baseline risk observed in the control group.\n\n3.  **Risk Difference (RD)**\nThe risk difference, also known as the absolute risk reduction when $R_0  R_1$, is the arithmetic difference in risk between the groups. It quantifies the absolute change in the probability of the outcome attributable to the intervention. By convention, the risk difference is calculated as the risk in the exposed (intervention) group minus the risk in the unexposed (control) group.\nThe formula is:\n$$RD = R_1 - R_0$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$RD = 0.12 - 0.30 = -0.18$$\nA negative risk difference indicates a reduction in risk. The absolute value, $|RD| = 0.18$, is the absolute risk reduction (ARR). This result means that the intervention led to an absolute reduction in the probability of contracting influenza of $0.18$, or $18$ percentage points.\n\n**Discussion of Complementary Interpretations**\nThe three measures provide different but complementary perspectives on the effect of the intervention.\n- The **Risk Ratio ($RR = 0.4$)** and **Relative Risk Reduction ($RRR = 0.6$)** are relative measures. They describe the strength of the intervention's effect in proportional terms. An RRR of $60\\%$ sounds substantial and is useful for communicating the efficacy of the intervention. However, relative measures do not depend on the baseline risk ($R_0$) and thus can be misleading about the overall public health impact. For instance, a $60\\%$ reduction in a very rare disease might prevent very few cases.\n- The **Risk Difference ($RD = -0.18$)** is an absolute measure. It reflects the actual magnitude of the risk change and is highly dependent on the baseline risk ($R_0$). In this case, with a high baseline risk of $R_0 = 0.30$, the intervention prevents $18$ cases for every $100$ people treated over one influenza season. This measure is often more valuable for public health and clinical decision-making because it directly translates to the number of adverse events averted. If the baseline risk were much lower, say $R_0=0.03$, the RR and RRR would remain the same, but the RD would be a much smaller $-0.018$, indicating a far lower absolute impact.\nIn summary, RR and RRR gauge the proportional efficacy of an intervention, while RD quantifies its absolute impact, providing a more direct basis for assessing its public health significance.\n\n**Final Calculation and Rounding**\nThe problem requires the numerical results for $(RR, RRR, RD)$ to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n- $RR = 0.4 \\to 0.4000$\n- $RRR = 0.6 \\to 0.6000$\n- $RD = -0.18 \\to -0.1800$\n\nThe final results are presented as a single row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.4000  0.6000  -0.1800\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4545554"}, {"introduction": "While risk is a powerful measure for cohorts with fixed follow-up, many real-world studies involve participants who are observed for varying lengths of time.

This practice will solidify your understanding of why the incidence rate is the appropriate measure for such studies and how it differs conceptually from a simplistic \"naive risk\" calculation.", "problem": "A cohort study of a preventable condition is conducted over a fixed calendar window of $12$ months, with staggered entry and varying follow-up. The scientific base for inference is as follows: cumulative incidence (risk) is the proportion of individuals who experience the event in a defined interval among those initially at risk, while the incidence rate is the number of events divided by the total person-time at risk, accumulated over individuals until event or censoring.

Eight individuals enroll at different calendar times and are followed until they experience the event of interest or are censored. Entry and exit are recorded on the study calendar.

Express the final rate per person-year.", "solution": "The solution is developed by addressing each of the three tasks sequentially, based on the provided definitions and data.\n\n#### Task 1: Total Person-Time at Risk\n\nThe person-time at risk for each individual is the duration of their follow-up, calculated as the exit time minus the entry time. The total person-time is the sum of these individual durations.\n\n- Person-time for A: $t_A = 4 - 0 = 4$ months.\n- Person-time for B: $t_B = 12 - 0 = 12$ months.\n- Person-time for C: $t_C = 8 - 1 = 7$ months.\n- Person-time for D: $t_D = 12 - 3 = 9$ months.\n- Person-time for E: $t_E = 11 - 5 = 6$ months.\n- Person-time for F: $t_F = 9 - 5 = 4$ months.\n- Person-time for G: $t_G = 10 - 8 = 2$ months.\n- Person-time for H: $t_H = 12 - 9 = 3$ months.\n\nThe total person-time at risk in months, $T_{person-months}$, is the sum of these individual person-times:\n$$T_{person-months} = t_A + t_B + t_C + t_D + t_E + t_F + t_G + t_H$$\n$$T_{person-months} = 4 + 12 + 7 + 9 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 3 = 47 \\text{ months}$$\n\nTo convert this to person-years, $T_{person-years}$, we divide by the number of months in a year, which is $12$.\n$$T_{person-years} = \\frac{47 \\text{ months}}{12 \\text{ months/year}} = \\frac{47}{12} \\text{ person-years}$$\n\n#### Task 2: Incidence Rate\n\nThe incidence rate, $I_R$, is defined as the total number of events divided by the total person-time at risk.\n\nFirst, we count the total number of events, $N_{events}$. An event is indicated by an event indicator of $1$.\n- Participants with an event: A, C, E, G.\n- Total number of events: $N_{events} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4$.\n\nNow, we compute the incidence rate in events per person-year using the total person-time in years calculated in Task 1.\n$$I_R = \\frac{N_{events}}{T_{person-years}} = \\frac{4}{\\frac{47}{12}} = \\frac{4 \\times 12}{47} = \\frac{48}{47} \\text{ events per person-year}$$\n\nTo obtain the numerical value required for the final answer, we perform the division and round to four significant figures:\n$$I_R = \\frac{48}{47} \\approx 1.02127659...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $1.021$.\n\n#### Task 3: Naive Risk and Conceptual Difference\n\nThe naive risk, which we can denote as $R_{naive}$, is defined as the total number of events divided by the number of individuals ever enrolled, $N_{total}$.\n$$N_{events} = 4$$\n$$N_{total} = 8$$\n$$R_{naive} = \\frac{N_{events}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{4}{8} = 0.5$$\n\n**Conceptual Difference:**\n\nThe **incidence rate** ($I_R \\approx 1.021$ events per person-year) is a true rate that measures the speed at which new events occur in the population at risk. Its units are events per unit of person-time (e.g., cases/person-year). It correctly accounts for the dynamic nature of the cohort, where individuals contribute varying amounts of time to the observation period due to staggered entry, loss to follow-up, or administrative censoring. It represents the instantaneous potential for an event per unit of time.\n\nThe **naive risk** ($R_{naive} = 0.5$) is a proportion, not a rate, and is dimensionless. It is an incorrect application of the concept of cumulative incidence. True cumulative incidence (risk) requires that all individuals in a defined cohort are followed for the same specified time interval. In this problem, the follow-up times are highly variable (from $2$ to $12$ months). By simply dividing the number of events by the total number of participants, this \"naive risk\" calculation incorrectly treats all $8$ individuals as if they were followed for a complete, uniform period during which the $4$ events occurred. It completely ignores the time dimension of follow-up, implicitly giving the same weight to a person followed for $2$ months as to a person followed for $12$ months. This makes it a conceptually flawed and misleading measure for a study with varying follow-up times. In this case, it likely underestimates the true risk over a full $12$-month period, as some individuals were not observed for the full duration.\n\nIn summary, the incidence rate measures the *hazard* or *rapidity* of event occurrence, while the naive risk is a simple, time-ignorant proportion that is improper for this study design.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.021}$$", "id": "4545564"}, {"introduction": "Crude, unadjusted measures of association can be dangerously misleading if a third variable, a confounder, distorts the relationship between an exposure and an outcome. This advanced problem demonstrates a classic case of Simpson's paradox, where the overall (crude) association suggests harm, while the analysis within specific subgroups reveals a benefit. By calculating both crude and stratum-specific risk ratios, you will learn to identify the presence of confounding and apply an adjusted summary measure to resolve the paradox and uncover the true effect of the intervention [@problem_id:4545542].", "problem": "An influenza vaccination program is evaluated using a cohort study that follows two age groups through one influenza season: adults aged at least $65$ years and adults aged less than $65$ years. Investigators record the number of influenza-related hospitalizations among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in each age group.

Within each age group, vaccination is associated with a lower risk of hospitalization ($RR_1 = 0.75$ and $RR_2 = 0.80$, both less than $1$). However, the crude analysis across the entire cohort suggests that vaccination is associated with a higher risk of hospitalization ($RR_{crude} \\approx 1.69$, which is greater than $1$). This paradox arises because age is a confounding variable. Age is associated with both the exposure (vaccination) and the outcome (hospitalization). The older age group has a much higher baseline risk of hospitalization ($R_{U1} = 0.20$ vs $R_{U2} = 0.0125$). Simultaneously, the vaccinated group is disproportionately composed of older individuals. In the vaccinated group, the proportion of individuals aged $\\geq 65$ is $\\frac{1200}{3200} = 37.5\\%$, whereas in the unvaccinated group, it is only $\\frac{1200}{9200} \\approx 13.0\\%$. The crude analysis fails to account for this imbalance, erroneously attributing the higher risk of the older population to the vaccine itself.\n\n**Task 2: Adjusted Common Risk Ratio**\n\nThe problem states the scientifically justified assumption that the true causal risk ratio is homogeneous across strata. This justifies the use of a summary estimator that pools the information from the two strata to estimate this common risk ratio, thereby adjusting for the confounding effect of age. The Mantel-Haenszel estimator for the common risk ratio ($RR_{MH}$) is the appropriate method for this cohort data structure. It is a weighted average of the stratum-specific effects.\n\nThe derivation of the Mantel-Haenszel estimator for the risk ratio is based on pooling stratum-specific counts, weighted by a factor that depends on the size of the unexposed and exposed groups within each stratum. The formula is:\n$$ RR_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{A_i N_{0i}}{T_i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{B_i N_{1i}}{T_i}} $$\nwhere $k$ is the number of strata, and $T_i = N_{1i} + N_{0i}$ is the total number of individuals in stratum $i$.\n\nWe will now apply this formula to the provided data ($k=2$).\n\nFor stratum $1$ (Age $\\geq 65$):\n$A_1 = 180$, $B_1 = 240$, $N_{11} = 1200$, $N_{01} = 1200$.\n$T_1 = N_{11} + N_{01} = 1200 + 1200 = 2400$.\nNumerator term: $\\frac{A_1 N_{01}}{T_1} = \\frac{180 \\times 1200}{2400} = \\frac{180}{2} = 90$.\nDenominator term: $\\frac{B_1 N_{11}}{T_1} = \\frac{240 \\times 1200}{2400} = \\frac{240}{2} = 120$.\n\nFor stratum $2$ (Age $ 65$):\n$A_2 = 20$, $B_2 = 100$, $N_{12} = 2000$, $N_{02} = 8000$.\n$T_2 = N_{12} + N_{02} = 2000 + 8000 = 10000$.\nNumerator term: $\\frac{A_2 N_{02}}{T_2} = \\frac{20 \\times 8000}{10000} = \\frac{160000}{10000} = 16$.\nDenominator term: $\\frac{B_2 N_{12}}{T_2} = \\frac{100 \\times 2000}{10000} = \\frac{200000}{10000} = 20$.\n\nNow we sum these terms across the two strata to calculate $RR_{MH}$.\nSum of numerator terms: $\\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{A_i N_{0i}}{T_i} = 90 + 16 = 106$.\nSum of denominator terms: $\\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{B_i N_{1i}}{T_i} = 120 + 20 = 140$.\n\nThe Mantel-Haenszel adjusted risk ratio is:\n$$ RR_{MH} = \\frac{106}{140} = \\frac{53}{70} $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ RR_{MH} = \\frac{53}{70} \\approx 0.7571428... $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get $0.7571$.
