{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "At the heart of any cohort study is the goal of quantifying and comparing the occurrence of disease or another health outcome between groups with different exposures. This first exercise provides a foundational scenario to master the calculation of cumulative incidence, which is simply the risk of developing an outcome over a specified time period. By calculating and comparing this risk in an exposed and unexposed group, you will compute the risk ratio, one of the most fundamental measures of association in epidemiology [@problem_id:4511182].", "problem": "A public health team is evaluating a screening intervention using two cohort study designs in the same population: a prospective cohort that enrolls participants at baseline and follows them forward for $2$ years, and a retrospective cohort that uses existing records to identify exposure status $2$ years ago and reconstruct outcomes up to the present. The cohort is closed, all individuals are free of the outcome at baseline, there is complete follow-up, and there are no competing risks or losses to follow-up.\n\nIn the exposed group, $2{,}000$ individuals are enrolled, and $80$ incident outcomes occur during the $2$-year period. In the unexposed group, $1{,}800$ individuals are enrolled, and $60$ incident outcomes occur during the same $2$-year period. Assume that the retrospective ascertainment yields the same counts as the prospective follow-up under these conditions.\n\nUsing only core definitions from cohort study design in preventive medicine, compute the cumulative incidence in the exposed group and in the unexposed group over $2$ years, and interpret how the difference reflects the effect of exposure in a cohort framework. Finally, report the risk ratio (ratio of cumulative incidence in the exposed to cumulative incidence in the unexposed) as a simplified fraction. Express the final risk ratio as an exact fraction; no rounding is required. Do not include units in your final reported value.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of cumulative incidence for two groups (exposed and unexposed) and the subsequent calculation of the risk ratio.\n\nFirst, we define cumulative incidence ($CI$), which is the proportion of a population initially at risk that develops the outcome over a specified time period. The formula is:\n$$\nCI = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases of the outcome}}{\\text{Number of individuals in the population at risk at the start of the period}}\n$$\nThe problem states that all individuals are free of the outcome at baseline, so the entire cohort in each group is at risk.\n\nFor the exposed group, the number of individuals enrolled at baseline is $N_{exp} = 2,000$. The number of incident outcomes during the $2$-year follow-up period is $A_{exp} = 80$. The cumulative incidence in the exposed group, $CI_{exp}$, is therefore:\n$$\nCI_{exp} = \\frac{A_{exp}}{N_{exp}} = \\frac{80}{2,000} = \\frac{8}{200} = \\frac{1}{25}\n$$\nThis means that the risk of developing the outcome over the $2$-year period for an individual in the exposed group is $\\frac{1}{25}$, or $4\\%$.\n\nFor the unexposed group, the number of individuals enrolled at baseline is $N_{unexp} = 1,800$. The number of incident outcomes during the same $2$-year period is $A_{unexp} = 60$. The cumulative incidence in the unexposed group, $CI_{unexp}$, is:\n$$\nCI_{unexp} = \\frac{A_{unexp}}{N_{unexp}} = \\frac{60}{1,800} = \\frac{6}{180} = \\frac{1}{30}\n$$\nThis means that the risk of developing the outcome over the $2$-year period for an individual in the unexposed group is $\\frac{1}{30}$, or approximately $3.33\\%$.\n\nThe problem asks for an interpretation of how the difference reflects the effect of exposure. A direct comparison shows that $CI_{exp} > CI_{unexp}$ ($\\frac{1}{25} > \\frac{1}{30}$). This indicates that the exposure is associated with an increased risk of developing the outcome. In the framework of a cohort study, where exposure precedes the outcome, this association suggests that the exposure is a risk factor for the outcome. The problem states that a prospective design (following individuals forward) and a retrospective design (looking back at records) yield the same counts under these ideal conditions, which underscores the theoretical equivalence of the two designs for measuring incidence.\n\nFinally, we compute the risk ratio ($RR$), also known as the relative risk. The risk ratio is the ratio of the cumulative incidence in the exposed group to the cumulative incidence in the unexposed group.\n$$\nRR = \\frac{CI_{exp}}{CI_{unexp}}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $CI_{exp}$ and $CI_{unexp}$:\n$$\nRR = \\frac{1/25}{1/30} = \\frac{1}{25} \\times \\frac{30}{1} = \\frac{30}{25}\n$$\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $5$:\n$$\nRR = \\frac{30 \\div 5}{25 \\div 5} = \\frac{6}{5}\n$$\nA risk ratio of $\\frac{6}{5}$ (or $1.2$) signifies that the risk of the outcome in the exposed group is $1.2$ times the risk in the unexposed group over the specified $2$-year period.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{6}{5}}$$", "id": "4511182"}, {"introduction": "While cumulative incidence is intuitive, real-world cohort studies often involve participants who are followed for varying lengths of time. This practice introduces a more flexible and powerful metric: the incidence rate, which accounts for the total \"person-time\" at risk.

Using the core definition that, in cohort studies, an incidence rate is the count of incident events divided by accrued person-time at risk, and that a rate ratio compares the incidence rate in the exposed group to that in the unexposed group, compute the incidence rate in the exposed group, the incidence rate in the unexposed group, and the rate ratio.

Thus, for any given group, the formula is:\n$$R = \\frac{\\text{Number of incident cases}}{\\text{Total person-time at risk}}$$\n\nUsing this definition, we can calculate the incidence rate for the exposed group, $R_E$.\n$$R_E = \\frac{I_E}{T_E} = \\frac{50}{400} \\text{ person-years}^{-1}$$\n$$R_E = \\frac{1}{8} \\text{ person-years}^{-1} = 0.125 \\text{ person-years}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The value $0.125$ has exactly three significant figures ($1$, $2$, $5$), so no rounding is necessary.\nThe incidence rate in the exposed group is $0.125$ events per person-year.\n\nNext, we calculate the incidence rate for the unexposed group, $R_U$.\n$$R_U = \\frac{I_U}{T_U} = \\frac{45}{600} \\text{ person-years}^{-1}$$\n$$R_U = \\frac{3 \\times 15}{40 \\times 15} \\text{ person-years}^{-1} = \\frac{3}{40} \\text{ person-years}^{-1} = 0.075 \\text{ person-years}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires this answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The value $0.075$ currently has two significant figures ($7$, $5$). To express it with three significant figures, we must add a trailing zero, which is significant in this context.\n$$R_U = 0.0750 \\text{ person-years}^{-1}$$\nThe incidence rate in the unexposed group is $0.0750$ events per person-year.\n\nFinally, the problem defines the rate ratio, $RR$, as the ratio of the incidence rate in the exposed group to that in the unexposed group.\n$$RR = \\frac{R_E}{R_U}$$\nSubstituting the calculated rates:\n$$RR = \\frac{0.125}{0.075} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{8}}{\\frac{3}{40}} = \\frac{1}{8} \\times \\frac{40}{3} = \\frac{40}{24} = \\frac{5}{3}$$\n$$RR \\approx 1.6666...$$\nRounding this value to three significant figures gives $1.67$.

The team constructs a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with the following variables and directed relationships:\n- Age at baseline, $A$, influences both smoking, $S$, and cardiovascular events, $Y$.\n- Socioeconomic status at baseline, $Z$, influences both smoking, $S$, and cardiovascular events, $Y$.\n- Smoking, $S$, causally affects incident hypertension during follow-up, $M$, which in turn affects cardiovascular events, $Y$.\n- In the retrospective cohort scenario, inclusion into the study database, $C$, is influenced by smoking, $S$, and also by the occurrence of cardiovascular events, $Y$ (for example, because smokers and those with events are more likely to appear in the records), making $C$ a collider on the path $S \\to C \\leftarrow Y$.\n\nAssume there are no other common causes of $S$ and $Y$ beyond those shown, and assume perfect measurement of $A$ and $Z$ at baseline.

The guiding principle for this is the **backdoor criterion**.\n\nA set of variables $\\mathbf{W}$ is a sufficient adjustment set if it satisfies two conditions:\n1.  No variable in $\\mathbf{W}$ is a descendant of the exposure ($S$). In this problem, we must also ensure no variable in $\\mathbf{W}$ is a descendant of any variable on a causal path from $S$ to $Y$, as the goal is the *total* effect.\n2.  The set $\\mathbf{W}$ blocks all non-causal (\"backdoor\") paths between the exposure ($S$) and the outcome ($Y$). A backdoor path is a path that starts with an arrow pointing into $S$.\n\nLet's represent the given information as a DAG:\n-   Confounding paths: $S \\leftarrow A \\to Y$ and $S \\leftarrow Z \\to Y$. Here, $A$ and $Z$ are common causes (confounders).\n-   Causal path: $S \\to M \\to Y$. Here, $M$ is a mediator. The total causal effect of $S$ on $Y$ includes the effect transmitted through $M$.\n-   Selection bias path: $S \\to C \\leftarrow Y$. Here, $C$ is a collider. This path is relevant in the retrospective study design where the analysis might be restricted to individuals in the database (i.e., conditional on $C=1$).\n\nTo estimate the **total causal effect**, we must:\n1.  **Block all backdoor paths:** The backdoor paths are $S \\leftarrow A \\to Y$ and $S \\leftarrow Z \\to Y$.\n    -   The path $S \\leftarrow A \\to Y$ is blocked by conditioning on (adjusting for) $A$.\n    -   The path $S \\leftarrow Z \\to Y$ is blocked by conditioning on (adjusting for) $Z$.\n    Therefore, adjusting for the set $\\{A, Z\\}$ is sufficient to block all backdoor paths, as the problem states there are no other common causes.\n\n2.  **Leave all causal paths open:** The causal path from $S$ to $Y$ is mediated by $M$ ($S \\to M \\to Y$). To estimate the *total* effect, we must not block this path. Conditioning on a mediator, $M$, would block this portion of the causal effect, leading to an estimate of the *direct* effect only, not the total effect. Therefore, we must **not** adjust for $M$.\n\n3.  **Avoid opening new non-causal paths:** The path $S \\to C \\leftarrow Y$ contains a collider, $C$. This path is naturally blocked. Conditioning on the collider $C$ (or any descendant of $C$) would unblock this path and introduce a spurious association between $S$ and $Y$, a phenomenon known as collider-stratification bias or selection bias. The problem explicitly directs us to avoid conditioning on $C$. Therefore, we must **not** adjust for $C$.\n\nBased on this reasoning, a sufficient adjustment set is $\\{A, Z\\}$.

While it blocks the confounding path through $A$, it leaves the path $S \\leftarrow Z \\to Y$ open, resulting in residual confounding by socioeconomic status ($Z$).\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C. Adjust for $Z$ only.**\n    This set is insufficient. While it blocks the confounding path through $Z$, it leaves the path $S \\leftarrow A \\to Y$ open, resulting in residual confounding by age ($A$).\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D.
