The use of the normal approximation to the binomial distribution for constructing a confidence interval for a proportion is a classical application of the Central Limit Theorem. The formula for the confidence interval and the concept of a margin of error are textbook definitions. The entire premise is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness and Completeness:** The problem is well-posed. It requests a derivation from specified first principles and then a calculation using provided numerical values. All necessary information is present: the form of the CI, the definition of margin of error, the desired confidence level, the target margin of error, and the planning value for the prevalence. The problem structure leads to a unique, meaningful solution.\n- **Objectivity and Clarity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and unambiguous language common to statistics and public health research. Terms like \"point prevalence,\" \"simple random sampling,\" \"confidence level,\" and \"margin of error\" have clear, universally accepted definitions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-defined, scientifically sound, and clear problem in applied statistics. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Sample Size Formula\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the minimum sample size, $n$, from the provided bases.\n\nFrom Fundamental Basis 2 and 3, the margin of error, which we will denote as $M$, is the half-width of the confidence interval.\n$$\nM = z_{\\alpha/2}\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\n$$\nThis expression depends on the true population prevalence, $p$, which is unknown before the study is conducted. For planning purposes, as specified in the problem, we must use a prior estimate, $p^{\\ast}$, in place of $p$. The planned margin of error is therefore:\n$$\nM_{\\text{planned}} = z_{\\alpha/2}\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{p^{\\ast}(1-p^{\\ast})}{n}}\n$$\nThe design specification requires that this planned margin of error does not exceed a target value, $E$. This establishes the following inequality:\n$$\nz_{\\alpha/2}\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{p^{\\ast}(1-p^{\\ast})}{n}} \\le E\n$$\nTo find the required sample size $n$, we solve this inequality for $n$. We assume $E > 0$, $z_{\\alpha/2} > 0$, and $0 < p^{\\ast} < 1$, which are all true in any practical application.\n\nFirst, we square both sides of the inequality:\n$$\n\\left(z_{\\alpha/2}\\right)^2 \\frac{p^{\\ast}(1-p^{\\ast})}{n} \\le E^2\n$$\nNext, we rearrange the terms to isolate $n$. Since $n$ must be positive, we can multiply both sides by $n$ and divide by $E^2$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$\n\\left(z_{\\alpha/2}\\right)^2 p^{\\ast}(1-p^{\\ast}) \\le n E^2\n$$\n$$\nn \\ge \\frac{\\left(z_{\\alpha/2}\\right)^2 p^{\\ast}(1-p^{\\ast})}{E^2}\n$$\nThe sample size, $n$, must be an integer. The inequality specifies the minimum value that $n$ can take. Therefore, the minimum integer sample size that satisfies this condition is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the expression on the right-hand side. This corresponds to the ceiling function.\n$$\nn_{\\text{min}} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{z_{\\alpha/2}^2 p^{\\ast}(1-p^{\\ast})}{E^2} \\right\\rceil\n$$\nThis is the required derived expression for the minimum integer sample size.\n\n### Computation of the Minimum Sample Size\n\nNow, we compute the value of $n$ using the provided design values:\n- Prior prevalence estimate: $p^{\\ast} = 0.12$\n- Target margin of error: $E = 0.015$\n- Nominal confidence level: $1-\\alpha = 0.95$\n\nFirst, we must determine the value of $z_{\\alpha/2}$. The confidence level is $1-\\alpha = 0.95$, which implies $\\alpha = 0.05$ and $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$. The value $z_{0.025}$ is the critical value from the standard normal distribution $Z$ that satisfies $\\Pr(|Z| \\le z_{0.025}) = 0.95$. This is equivalent to finding the value such that the area in the upper tail is $0.025$, i.e., $\\Pr(Z > z_{0.025}) = 0.025$. The cumulative probability is $\\Phi(z_{0.025}) = 1 - 0.025 = 0.975$. This is a standard quantile, and its value is approximately $1.96$. Thus, $z_{0.025} \\approx 1.96$.\n\nWe now substitute the numerical values into the derived inequality for $n$:\n$$\nn \\ge \\frac{(1.96)^2 \\times 0.12 \\times (1-0.12)}{(0.015)^2}\n$$\nWe compute the components of this expression:\n- $(1.96)^2 = 3.8416$\n- $p^{\\ast}(1-p^{\\ast}) = 0.12 \\times (0.88) = 0.1056$\n- $E^2 = (0.015)^2 = 0.000225$\n\nSubstituting these back into the inequality:\n$$\nn \\ge \\frac{3.8416 \\times 0.1056}{0.000225}\n$$\n$$\nn \\ge \\frac{0.405673056}{0.000225}\n$$\n$$\nn \\ge 1802.99136\n$$\nSince the sample size $n$ must be an integer, the minimum number of participants required is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to $1802.99136$.\n$$\nn = \\lceil 1802.99136 \\rceil = 1803\n$$\nTherefore, the minimum integer sample size required to guarantee that the margin of error does not exceed $0.015$ at a $95\\%$ confidence level, based on a prevalence estimate of $0.12$, is $1803$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1803}\n$$", "id": "4517839"}, {"introduction": "After collecting data, the core task is to quantify the relationship between an exposure and an outcome.

Interpretation of $PR$, $PD$, and $POR$.**\n\n- **Prevalence Difference ($PD$)**: The $PD$ is $0.06$, or $6$ percentage points. This is an absolute measure of effect. It signifies that there are $6$ excess cases of asthma for every $100$ people in the high-exposure neighborhood compared to the low-exposure neighborhood at the time of the survey. From a preventive medicine perspective, the $PD$ quantifies the absolute public health burden associated with the exposure. If the association were causal, this measure would imply that eliminating high exposure could prevent $6$ cases of asthma per $100$ people in the population.\n\n- **Prevalence Ratio ($PR$)**: The $PR$ is $1.6$. This is a relative measure of effect. It indicates that the prevalence of asthma is $1.6$ times higher (or $60\\%$ higher) in the high-exposure group compared to the low-exposure group. The $PR$ is used to describe the strength of the association between the exposure and the outcome. A value greater than $1$ suggests a positive association. In etiological research, it helps to assess the magnitude of an association.\n\n- **Prevalence Odds Ratio ($POR$)**: The $POR$ is $12/7 \\approx 1.71$. This is also a relative measure of effect. It means that the odds of having asthma are approximately $1.71$ times greater for individuals in the high-exposure group compared to those in the low-exposure group. In cross-sectional studies, the $POR$ is often used as an estimate of the association, particularly in the context of logistic regression models. When the outcome is not rare (as in this case, where prevalences are $10\\%$ and $16\\%$), the $POR$ is not a good approximation of the $PR$ ($1.71$ vs. $1.6$), and it tends to overestimate the strength of the association as measured by the $PR$. The $PR$ is generally considered more directly interpretable for prevalence data.\n\n**4.
