The target effect is the risk difference $\\Delta = p_1 - p_0$, and suppose the design aims to test the null hypothesis $H_0: p_1 - p_0 = 0$ against the two-sided alternative $H_1: p_1 - p_0 \\neq 0$ at type I error $\\,\\alpha\\,$ and achieve power $\\,1 - \\beta\\,$ to detect the prespecified nonzero risk difference $\\,\\Delta\\,$.\n\nUse the following fundamental base:\n- Under independent sampling, the sample proportion $\\hat{p}_a$ in arm $a \\in \\{0,1\\}$ has large-sample distribution $\\hat{p}_a \\approx \\mathcal{N}\\!\\left(p_a,\\, p_a(1 - p_a)/n\\right)$ for $n$ participants per arm, by the Central Limit Theorem, and the two arms are independent under equal allocation.\n- The difference in sample proportions $D = \\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_0$ is approximately normal with mean $p_1 - p_0$ and variance $p_1(1 - p_1)/n + p_0(1 - p_0)/n$ by independence.\n- For a $2$-sided $\\alpha$-level test of $H_0$, a rejection threshold is set using the standard normal quantile function $\\Phi^{-1}(\\cdot)$ and a design-stage null variance.

It provides a complete and consistent set of givens and assumptions from which a unique, analytical solution can be derived.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   **Study Design**: Two-arm randomized controlled trial with equal allocation ($n$ participants per arm).\n-   **Outcome**: Binary.\n-   **Parameters**: $p_0$ is the true event probability in the control arm; $p_1$ is the true event probability in the intervention arm.\n-   **Effect Measure**: Risk difference, $\\Delta = p_1 - p_0$.\n-   **Hypotheses**: Null hypothesis $H_0: p_1 - p_0 = 0$; alternative hypothesis $H_1: p_1 - p_0 \\neq 0$.\n-   **Error Rates**: Type I error rate is $\\alpha$; Type II error rate is $\\beta$, corresponding to a power of $1 - \\beta$.\n-   **Distributional Assumptions**:\n    1.  The sample proportion in arm $a \\in \\{0,1\\}$, denoted $\\hat{p}_a$, is approximately normally distributed: $\\hat{p}_a \\sim \\mathcal{N}(p_a, \\frac{p_a(1-p_a)}{n})$.\n    2.

The test uses the standard normal quantile function $\\Phi^{-1}(\\cdot)$.\n    2.  For design, the null variance of $D$ is based on a planning value $p_{\\ast} = (p_0 + p_1)/2$, yielding a standard deviation for $D$ under $H_0$ of $\\sqrt{2 p_{\\ast}(1-p_{\\ast})/n}$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on the well-established statistical theory for comparing two proportions using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, which is a fundamental concept in designing clinical trials.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined, providing all necessary parameters ($\\alpha, \\beta, p_0, p_1$) and distributional foundations to derive the required sample size, $n$. The instructions are explicit and lead to a unique solution.\n-   **Objective**: The language is formal, precise, and devoid of any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem is valid as it satisfies all criteria for a well-formulated scientific question.\n\n### Derivation of the Sample Size Formula\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the per-arm sample size, $n$, that satisfies the specified type I and type II error constraints. The derivation proceeds from the given first principles.\n\n**1. Type I Error and the Rejection Rule**\n\nThe null hypothesis is $H_0: \\Delta = p_1 - p_0 = 0$. The test statistic is the observed difference in proportions, $D = \\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_0$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, for the purpose of trial design, the distribution of $D$ under $H_0$ is taken to be approximately normal with a mean of $0$ and a variance, $\\text{Var}_0(D)$, constructed using the planning value $p_{\\ast} = (p_0 + p_1)/2$.\n$$ \\text{Var}_0(D) = \\frac{2 p_{\\ast}(1 - p_{\\ast})}{n} = \\frac{2 \\left(\\frac{p_0+p_1}{2}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{p_0+p_1}{2}\\right)}{n} $$\nFor a two-sided test with a type I error rate of $\\alpha$, we reject $H_0$ if the observed difference $|D|$ is greater than a critical value, $C$. This critical value is determined by the tails of the null distribution. The standardized statistic under $H_0$ would be $Z = D / \\sqrt{\\text{Var}_0(D)}$. We reject if $|Z| > \\Phi^{-1}(1 - \\alpha/2)$.\nThis implies that the rejection region for the unstandardized difference $D$ is $|D| > C$, where:\n$$ C = \\Phi^{-1}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\sqrt{\\text{Var}_0(D)} = \\Phi^{-1}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{2 p_{\\ast}(1 - p_{\\ast})}{n}} $$\n\n**2. Type II Error and Power**\n\nPower is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when the alternative hypothesis $H_1$ is true. Under $H_1$, the true difference is $\\Delta = p_1 - p_0 \\neq 0$.\n\nThe distribution of $D$ under $H_1$ is approximately normal with mean $\\Delta$ and variance $\\text{Var}_1(D)$:\n$$ D \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\Delta, \\text{Var}_1(D)\\right) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\text{Var}_1(D) = \\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n} + \\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n} $$\nThe power, $1 - \\beta$, is the probability that $D$ falls in the rejection region, i.e., $P(|D| > C | H_1)$.\n$$ 1 - \\beta = P(D > C | H_1) + P(D < -C | H_1) $$\nAssuming $\\Delta > 0$ (the case for $\\Delta < 0$ is symmetric), the term $P(D < -C | H_1)$ is typically negligible for a well-powered study, as the distribution of $D$ is centered far from $-C$. Thus, we can approximate the power by the first term:\n$$ 1 - \\beta \\approx P(D > C | H_1) $$\nTo evaluate this probability, we standardize $D$ using its distribution under $H_1$:\n$$ 1 - \\beta \\approx P\\left( \\frac{D - \\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}_1(D)}} > \\frac{C - \\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}_1(D)}} \\right) $$\nThe term on the left inside the probability is a standard normal variable, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.\n$$ P\\left( Z > \\frac{C - \\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}_1(D)}} \\right) = 1 - \\beta $$\nFrom the definition of the standard normal cumulative distribution function, $\\Phi$, this implies:\n$$ \\frac{C - \\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}_1(D)}} = \\Phi^{-1}(1 - (1-\\beta)) = \\Phi^{-1}(\\beta) $$\nSolving for the critical value $C$, we obtain a second expression for it, this time from the power requirement:\n$$ C = \\Delta + \\Phi^{-1}(\\beta) \\sqrt{\\text{Var}_1(D)} $$\n\n**3. Solving for the Sample Size, n**\n\nWe now have two expressions for the critical value $C$, one from the type I error constraint and one from the power constraint. By equating them, we can solve for $n$.\n$$ \\Phi^{-1}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\sqrt{\\text{Var}_0(D)} = \\Delta + \\Phi^{-1}(\\beta) \\sqrt{\\text{Var}_1(D)} $$\nSubstitute the expressions for the variances, which both depend on $1/\\sqrt{n}$:\n$$ \\Phi^{-1}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\frac{\\sqrt{2 p_{\\ast}(1 - p_{\\ast})}}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\Delta + \\Phi^{-1}(\\beta) \\frac{\\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1) + p_0(1-p_0)}}{\\sqrt{n}} $$\nRearrange the equation to isolate $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\left[ \\Phi^{-1}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\sqrt{2 p_{\\ast}(1 - p_{\\ast})} - \\Phi^{-1}(\\beta) \\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1) + p_0(1-p_0)} \\right] $$\nUsing the symmetry property of the standard normal quantile function, $\\Phi^{-1}(\\beta) = -\\Phi^{-1}(1-\\beta)$:\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\left[ \\Phi^{-1}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\sqrt{2 p_{\\ast}(1 - p_{\\ast})} + \\Phi^{-1}(1-\\beta) \\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1) + p_0(1-p_0)} \\right] $$\nNow, we solve for $\\sqrt{n}$ and then square the result to find $n$:\n$$ \\sqrt{n} = \\frac{\\Phi^{-1}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\sqrt{2 p_{\\ast}(1 - p_{\\ast})} + \\Phi^{-1}(1-\\beta) \\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1) + p_0(1-p_0)}}{\\Delta} $$\n$$ n = \\left( \\frac{\\Phi^{-1}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\sqrt{2 p_{\\ast}(1 - p_{\\ast})} + \\Phi^{-1}(1-\\beta) \\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1) + p_0(1-p_0)}}{\\Delta} \\right)^2 $$\nSubstituting the definition of $p_{\\ast} = (p_0+p_1)/2$ and writing the expression as a single fraction yields the final closed-form expression for the per-arm sample size $n$.\n$$ n = \\frac{\\left( \\Phi^{-1}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\sqrt{2 \\left(\\frac{p_0+p_1}{2}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{p_0+p_1}{2}\\right)} + \\Phi^{-1}(1-\\beta) \\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0) + p_1(1-p_1)} \\right)^2}{\\Delta^2} $$\nThis expression provides the required sample size per arm as a function of the specified parameters $p_0$, $p_1$, $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and the risk difference $\\Delta = p_1-p_0$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\frac{\\left( \\Phi^{-1}\\left(1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\sqrt{2 \\left(\\frac{p_0+p_1}{2}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{p_0+p_1}{2}\\right)} + \\Phi^{-1}(1-\\beta) \\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0) + p_1(1-p_1)} \\right)^{2}}{\\Delta^{2}} } $$", "id": "4628034"}, {"introduction": "Randomization is the cornerstone of the RCT, designed to create groups that are, on average, comparable across all baseline characteristics.

In an RCT, these probabilities are estimated directly from the observed proportions in each arm.\n\nThe risk in the intervention arm is estimated as:\n$$ \\hat{R}_1 = \\frac{A_1}{N_1} = \\frac{100}{1000} = \\frac{1}{10} $$\nThe risk in the control arm is estimated as:\n$$ \\hat{R}_0 = \\frac{A_0}{N_0} = \\frac{150}{1000} = \\frac{15}{100} = \\frac{3}{20} $$\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Effect Measures**\n\n1.  **Risk Difference (RD)**: The risk difference is the arithmetic difference in risks between the two arms.\n    $$ RD = R_1 - R_0 $$\n    Using the sample estimates:\n    $$ \\hat{RD} = \\hat{R}_1 - \\hat{R}_0 = \\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{3}{20} = \\frac{2}{20} - \\frac{3}{20} = -\\frac{1}{20} $$\n\n2.  **Risk Ratio (RR)**: The risk ratio is the ratio of the risks in the two arms.\n    $$ RR = \\frac{R_1}{R_0} $$\n    Using the sample estimates:\n    $$ \\hat{RR} = \\frac{\\hat{R}_1}{\\hat{R}_0} = \\frac{1/10}{3/20} = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{20}{3} = \\frac{20}{30} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\n\n3.  **Odds Ratio (OR)**: First, we define the odds of an outcome as the ratio of the probability of the outcome occurring to the probability of it not occurring.\n    $$ \\text{Odds}(x) = \\frac{P(Y=1|X=x)}{P(Y=0|X=x)} = \\frac{R_x}{1-R_x} $$\n    The odds ratio is the ratio of the odds in the intervention arm to the odds in the control arm.\n    $$ OR = \\frac{\\text{Odds}(1)}{\\text{Odds}(0)} = \\frac{R_1 / (1-R_1)}{R_0 / (1-R_0)} $$\n    The sample odds are:\n    $$ \\hat{\\text{Odds}}_1 = \\frac{\\hat{R}_1}{1-\\hat{R}_1} = \\frac{1/10}{1 - 1/10} = \\frac{1/10}{9/10} = \\frac{1}{9} $$\n    $$ \\hat{\\text{Odds}}_0 = \\frac{\\hat{R}_0}{1-\\hat{R}_0} = \\frac{3/20}{1 - 3/20} = \\frac{3/20}{17/20} = \\frac{3}{17} $$\n    The sample odds ratio is:\n    $$ \\hat{OR} = \\frac{\\hat{\\text{Odds}}_1}{\\hat{\\text{Odds}}_0} = \\frac{1/9}{3/17} = \\frac{1}{9} \\times \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{17}{27} $$\n    Alternatively, the odds ratio can be computed as the cross-product ratio from the $2 \\times 2$ contingency table:\n    $$ \\hat{OR} = \\frac{A_1 B_0}{A_0 B_1} = \\frac{100 \\times 850}{150 \\times 900} = \\frac{85000}{135000} = \\frac{85}{135} = \\frac{17}{27} $$\n\n**Part 2: Collapsibility Analysis**\n\nCollapsibility refers to the property that a marginal (crude) measure of effect is equal to a common stratum-specific measure of effect, given there is no effect modification across strata. The stratification is done by a third variable, say $Z$. The problem specifies the context of \"randomized assignment with no unmeasured confounders\" and \"no effect modification\".\n\nLet $Z$ be a baseline covariate (e.g., age, sex) with levels $k=1, 2, \\dots, K$.\nThe marginal risk in arm $x$ is $R_x = P(Y=1|X=x)$. By the law of total probability, we can expand this over the strata of $Z$:\n$$ R_x = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} P(Y=1|X=x, Z=k) P(Z=k|X=x) $$\nLet $R_{xk} = P(Y=1|X=x, Z=k)$ be the stratum-specific risk.\nIn an RCT, randomization ensures that the treatment assignment $X$ is statistically independent of any baseline covariate $Z$. Thus, $P(Z=k|X=x) = P(Z=k)$ for all $x$. Let $p_k = P(Z=k)$.\nThe marginal risks are then a weighted average of the stratum-specific risks:\n$$ R_1 = \\sum_{k} R_{1k} p_k $$\n$$ R_0 = \\sum_{k} R_{0k} p_k $$\nThe condition \"no effect modification\" means the effect measure is constant across the strata of $Z$.\n\n- **Risk Difference (RD)**:\n  The marginal RD is $RD = R_1 - R_0$. The stratum-specific RD is $RD_k = R_{1k} - R_{0k}$.\n  The \"no effect modification\" condition implies $RD_k = RD_{\\text{common}}$ for all $k$.\n  $$ RD = R_1 - R_0 = \\sum_{k} R_{1k} p_k - \\sum_{k} R_{0k} p_k = \\sum_{k} (R_{1k} - R_{0k}) p_k = \\sum_{k} RD_k p_k $$\n  Substituting $RD_k = RD_{\\text{common}}$:\n  $$ RD = \\sum_{k} RD_{\\text{common}} p_k = RD_{\\text{common}} \\sum_{k} p_k = RD_{\\text{common}} \\times 1 = RD_{\\text{common}} $$\n  The marginal RD equals the common stratum-specific RD. Therefore, the risk difference is collapsible. $I_{\\text{RD}} = 1$.\n\n- **Risk Ratio (RR)**:\n  The marginal RR is $RR = R_1 / R_0$. The stratum-specific RR is $RR_k = R_{1k} / R_{0k}$.\n  The \"no effect modification\" condition implies $RR_k = RR_{\\text{common}}$ for all $k$, so $R_{1k} = RR_{\\text{common}} \\times R_{0k}$.\n  $$ RR = \\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{\\sum_{k} R_{1k} p_k}{\\sum_{k} R_{0k} p_k} $$\n  Substituting $R_{1k} = RR_{\\text{common}} R_{0k}$:\n  $$ RR = \\frac{\\sum_{k} (RR_{\\text{common}} R_{0k}) p_k}{\\sum_{k} R_{0k} p_k} = \\frac{RR_{\\text{common}} \\sum_{k} R_{0k} p_k}{\\sum_{k} R_{0k} p_k} = RR_{\\text{common}} $$\n  The marginal RR equals the common stratum-specific RR. Therefore, the risk ratio is collapsible. $I_{\\text{RR}} = 1$.\n\n- **Odds Ratio (OR)**:\n  The marginal OR is $OR = \\frac{R_1/(1-R_1)}{R_0/(1-R_0)}$. The stratum-specific OR is $OR_k = \\frac{R_{1k}/(1-R_{1k})}{R_{0k}/(1-R_{0k})}$.\n  The \"no effect modification\" condition implies $OR_k = OR_{\\text{common}}$ for all $k$.\n  The odds function, $f(p) = p/(1-p)$, is a non-linear convex function. Due to this non-linearity, the weighted average of risks does not translate into a simple form for the odds. The marginal odds are:\n  $$ \\text{Odds}_1 = \\frac{\\sum_k R_{1k}p_k}{1 - \\sum_k R_{1k}p_k} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\text{Odds}_0 = \\frac{\\sum_k R_{0k}p_k}{1 - \\sum_k R_{0k}p_k} $$\n  By Jensen's inequality, for a non-linear function $f$, $f(E[X]) \\neq E[f(X)]$. Here, the marginal risk $R_x$ is the expectation of the stratum-specific risks $R_{xk}$ over the distribution of $Z$. Thus, the marginal odds, $\\text{Odds}_x = f(R_x) = f(E[R_{xk}])$, are not equal to the weighted average of the stratum-specific odds, $E[f(R_{xk})] = \\sum_k f(R_{xk}) p_k$.\n  Consequently, the marginal odds ratio $OR = \\text{Odds}_1 / \\text{Odds}_0$ will not, in general, be equal to the common stratum-specific odds ratio $OR_{\\text{common}}$, unless $Z$ is not a risk factor for the outcome (i.e., $R_{0k}$ is constant over $k$) or the treatment has no effect ($OR_{\\text{common}}=1$). Since these exceptions are not generally true, the odds ratio is non-collapsible. $I_{\\text{OR}} = 0$.\n\nCombining the results, the final values are:\n- Risk Difference: $-\\frac{1}{20}$\n- Risk Ratio: $\\frac{2}{3}$\n- Odds Ratio: $\\frac{17}{27}$\n- $I_{\\text{RD}} = 1$ (collapsible)\n- $I_{\\text{RR}} = 1$ (collapsible)\n- $I_{\\text{OR}} = 0$ (non-collapsible)\n\nThe final answer will be presented as a row matrix.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-\\frac{1}{20} & \\frac{2}{3} & \\frac{17}{27} & 1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-\\frac{1}{20} & \\frac{2}{3} & \\frac{17}{27} & 1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4628160"}]}
