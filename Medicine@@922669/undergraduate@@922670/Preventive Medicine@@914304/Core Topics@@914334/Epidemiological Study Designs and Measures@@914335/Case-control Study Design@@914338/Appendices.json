The problem does not violate any scientific principles, is formalizable, complete, realistic, and well-structured.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe odds ratio ($OR$) is a measure of association between an exposure and an outcome. In a case-control study, it is defined as the ratio of the odds of exposure among the cases to the odds of exposure among the controls.\n\nLet $E$ denote the exposure (low-butyrate profile) and $D$ denote the disease (depression). We are given the prevalence of the exposure within the case group and the control group.\nThe prevalence of exposure among cases is the conditional probability $P(E|D)$.\nThe prevalence of exposure among controls is the conditional probability $P(E|\\bar{D})$.\n\nFrom the givens:\n$P(E|D) = p_{case} = 0.30$\n$P(E|\\bar{D}) = p_{control} = 0.15$\n\nThe odds of exposure for a given group is the ratio of the probability of being exposed to the probability of not being exposed within that group.\n\nThe odds of exposure among cases (individuals with depression) is:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{cases}} = \\frac{P(E|D)}{P(\\bar{E}|D)} = \\frac{P(E|D)}{1 - P(E|D)} $$\nSubstituting the given value:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{cases}} = \\frac{0.30}{1 - 0.30} = \\frac{0.30}{0.70} = \\frac{3}{7} $$\n\nThe odds of exposure among controls (individuals without depression) is:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{controls}} = \\frac{P(E|\\bar{D})}{P(\\bar{E}|\\bar{D})} = \\frac{P(E|\\bar{D})}{1 - P(E|\\bar{D})} $$\nSubstituting the given value:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{controls}} = \\frac{0.15}{1 - 0.15} = \\frac{0.15}{0.85} = \\frac{15}{85} = \\frac{3}{17} $$\n\nThe odds ratio ($OR$) is the ratio of these two odds:\n$$ OR = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{cases}}}{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{controls}}} $$\nSubstituting the calculated odds:\n$$ OR = \\frac{3/7}{3/17} = \\frac{3}{7} \\times \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{17}{7} $$\n\nTo obtain the numerical result, we perform the division:\n$$ OR = \\frac{17}{7} \\approx 2.428571... $$\nThe problem requires rounding to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $2$, $4$, and $2$. The fourth digit is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the third significant figure.\n$$ OR \\approx 2.43 $$\n\nAlternatively, one could construct a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table.\nTotal cases = $200$. Exposed cases ($a$) = $200 \\times 0.30 = 60$. Unexposed cases ($c$) = $200 - 60 = 140$.\nTotal controls = $200$. Exposed controls ($b$) = $200 \\times 0.15 = 30$. Unexposed controls ($d$) = $200 - 30 = 170$.\nThe odds ratio is calculated as $OR = \\frac{ad}{bc}$:\n$$ OR = \\frac{60 \\times 170}{30 \\times 140} = \\frac{10200}{4200} = \\frac{102}{42} = \\frac{17 \\times 6}{7 \\times 6} = \\frac{17}{7} \\approx 2.43 $$\nThis confirms the previous result.\n\n**Interpretation:**\nAn odds ratio of $1$ signifies no association. An odds ratio greater than $1$ signifies a positive association, meaning the exposure is associated with higher odds of the outcome. An odds ratio of $2.43$ means that the odds of having a low-butyrate-producing microbial profile are $2.43$ times higher for individuals with depression compared to individuals without depression. In epidemiological terms, this represents a moderate-to-strong positive association.\n\nConceptually, this finding provides quantitative support for hypotheses derived from the gut-brain-microbiome axis model. Butyrate is a critical short-chain fatty acid produced by gut bacteria that has pleiotropic effects, including maintaining gut barrier integrity, exerting systemic anti-inflammatory effects (e.g., via histone deacetylase inhibition), and potentially influencing neurotransmitter systems. A deficiency in butyrate production, as indicated by the \"low-butyrate profile,\" is biologically plausibly linked to the pathophysiology of depression, particularly through mechanisms involving low-grade systemic inflammation and neuro-inflammation, which are themselves implicated in depression. While this case-control study demonstrates a strong association, it does not establish causality; it is possible that depression and its associated behavioral changes (e.g., diet, stress) could alter the microbiome, rather than the microbiome profile being a primary cause. Nonetheless, the magnitude of the odds ratio ($2.43$) reinforces the gut-brain axis as a significant area of investigation in understanding major depressive disorder.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2.43}\n$$", "id": "4752397"}, {"introduction": "A point estimate like the $OR$ is informative, but its true value lies in understanding its precision. This practice moves beyond a single number to introduce the concept of the confidence interval (CI), which provides a range of plausible values for the true population $OR$.

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of epidemiology and biostatistics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objectively stated.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Odds Ratio Estimator**\n\nThe odds ratio is defined as the ratio of the odds of exposure among cases ($D$) to the odds of exposure among controls ($\\bar{D}$).\nLet $E$ denote exposure and $\\bar{E}$ denote non-exposure. The odds of exposure in the case group is:\n$$\n\\text{odds}_{D} = \\frac{P(E \\mid D)}{P(\\bar{E} \\mid D)} = \\frac{P(E \\mid D)}{1 - P(E \\mid D)}\n$$\nThe odds of exposure in the control group is:\n$$\n\\text{odds}_{\\bar{D}} = \\frac{P(E \\mid \\bar{D})}{P(\\bar{E} \\mid \\bar{D})} = \\frac{P(E \\mid \\bar{D})}{1 - P(E \\mid \\bar{D})}\n$$\nThe true odds ratio is the ratio of these two quantities:\n$$\n\\text{OR} = \\frac{\\text{odds}_{D}}{\\text{odds}_{\\bar{D}}}\n$$\nIn a case-control study, we sample a fixed number of cases, $N_{D} = a+c$, and a fixed number of controls, $N_{\\bar{D}} = b+d$. Within these samples, we can directly estimate the conditional probabilities of exposure. The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the probability of exposure given case status, $P(E \\mid D)$, is the sample proportion of exposed cases:\n$$\n\\hat{P}(E \\mid D) = \\frac{a}{a+c}\n$$\nSimilarly, the MLE for the probability of non-exposure given case status is:\n$$\n\\hat{P}(\\bar{E} \\mid D) = \\frac{c}{a+c}\n$$\nThe estimator for the odds of exposure among cases is therefore:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{odds}}_{D} = \\frac{\\hat{P}(E \\mid D)}{\\hat{P}(\\bar{E} \\mid D)} = \\frac{a / (a+c)}{c / (a+c)} = \\frac{a}{c}\n$$\nAnalogous logic applies to the control group:\n$$\n\\hat{P}(E \\mid \\bar{D}) = \\frac{b}{b+d} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\hat{P}(\\bar{E} \\mid \\bar{D}) = \\frac{d}{b+d}\n$$\nThe estimator for the odds of exposure among controls is:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{odds}}_{\\bar{D}} = \\frac{\\hat{P}(E \\mid \\bar{D})}{\\hat{P}(\\bar{E} \\mid \\bar{D})} = \\frac{b / (b+d)}{d / (b+d)} = \\frac{b}{d}\n$$\nThe estimator for the odds ratio, denoted $\\widehat{\\text{OR}}$, is the ratio of these estimated odds, commonly known as the cross-product ratio:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{OR}} = \\frac{\\widehat{\\text{odds}}_{D}}{\\widehat{\\text{odds}}_{\\bar{D}}} = \\frac{a/c}{b/d} = \\frac{ad}{bc}\n$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Large-Sample Variance of $\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$**\n\nThe distribution of $\\widehat{\\text{OR}}$ is typically skewed. However, its natural logarithm, $\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$, is approximately normally distributed for large sample sizes. Let $\\hat{\\theta} = \\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$.\n$$\n\\hat{\\theta} = \\log\\left(\\frac{ad}{bc}\\right) = \\log(a) + \\log(d) - \\log(b) - \\log(c)\n$$\nThe variance of $\\hat{\\theta}$ can be derived using the delta method. A standard result, known as the Woolf method, is that the large-sample approximation for the variance of $\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$ is the sum of the reciprocals of the cell counts. This can be justified by considering that under independent sampling of cases and controls, the counts of exposed subjects, $a$ and $b$, are independent binomial random variables: $a \\sim \\text{Bin}(N_D, p_1)$ and $b \\sim \\text{Bin}(N_{\\bar{D}}, p_2)$, where $p_1 = P(E|D)$ and $p_2 = P(E|\\bar{D})$. The quantity $\\hat{\\theta}$ can be written as $\\text{logit}(\\hat{p}_1) - \\text{logit}(\\hat{p}_2)$, where $\\hat{p}_1 = a/N_D$ and $\\hat{p}_2=b/N_{\\bar{D}}$.\nBy the delta method, the variance of the logit of a binomial proportion $\\hat{p} = k/n$ is approximately $\\frac{1}{np(1-p)}$. This is estimated by substituting observed counts, yielding $\\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{1}{n-k}$.\nApplying this to our independent samples:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\text{Var}(\\text{logit}(\\hat{p}_1)) + \\text{Var}(\\text{logit}(\\hat{p}_2)) \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{c}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{d}\\right)\n$$\nThus, the estimator for the variance of $\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$ is:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})) = \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{d}\n$$\n\n**3. Confidence Interval Construction and Calculation**\n\nUnder the large-sample assumption, the estimator $\\hat{\\theta} = \\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$ follows a normal distribution:\n$$\n\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}}) \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\log(\\text{OR}), \\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}}))\\right)\n$$\nThe standard error (SE) of $\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$ is the square root of its variance:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{SE}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{d}}\n$$\nA two-sided $100(1-\\alpha)\\%$ confidence interval for $\\log(\\text{OR})$ is constructed as:\n$$\n\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}}) \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\times \\widehat{\\text{SE}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}}))\n$$\nwhere $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the critical value from the standard normal distribution. For a $0.95$ confidence level, $\\alpha=0.05$, so $1-\\alpha/2 = 0.975$. The corresponding critical value is $z_{0.975} \\approx 1.96$.\n\nTo obtain the confidence interval for the $\\text{OR}$ itself, we exponentiate the lower and upper bounds of the interval for $\\log(\\text{OR})$. The lower limit for the $\\text{OR}$ is:\n$$\n\\text{LL}_{\\text{OR}} = \\exp\\left[\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}}) - z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\times \\widehat{\\text{SE}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}}))\\right]\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given cell counts: $a = 75$, $b = 30$, $c = 25$, and $d = 70$.\n\nFirst, calculate the point estimate $\\widehat{\\text{OR}}$:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{OR}} = \\frac{ad}{bc} = \\frac{75 \\times 70}{30 \\times 25} = \\frac{5250}{750} = 7\n$$\nNext, calculate the variance and standard error of $\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})) = \\frac{1}{75} + \\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{1}{25} + \\frac{1}{70}\n$$\nUsing a common denominator of $1050$:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})) = \\frac{14}{1050} + \\frac{35}{1050} + \\frac{42}{1050} + \\frac{15}{1050} = \\frac{14+35+42+15}{1050} = \\frac{106}{1050} = \\frac{53}{525}\n$$\nNumerically, $\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})) \\approx 0.10095238$.\nThe standard error is:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{SE}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{53}{525}} \\approx 0.3177300\n$$\nNow we construct the $0.95$ CI for $\\log(\\text{OR})$. The point estimate is $\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}}) = \\ln(7) \\approx 1.945910$.\nThe lower limit for $\\log(\\text{OR})$ is:\n$$\n\\text{LL}_{\\log(\\text{OR})} = \\ln(7) - 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{53}{525}} \\approx 1.945910 - 1.96 \\times 0.3177300 \\approx 1.945910 - 0.6227508 \\approx 1.3231592\n$$\nFinally, we compute the lower limit for the $\\text{OR}$ by exponentiating this value:\n$$\n\\text{LL}_{\\text{OR}} = \\exp(1.3231592) \\approx 3.75515\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the lower limit is $3.755$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.755}$$", "id": "4574844"}, {"introduction": "In the real world, the relationship between an exposure and a disease is rarely isolated; it is often influenced by other variables.

For a given stratum, the data can be organized into a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table. Let 'Exposure' refer to daily high-intensity physical activity and 'Outcome' refer to symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. The standard notation for the cell counts is as follows:\n\n- $a$: number of cases who were exposed.\n- $b$: number of controls who were exposed.\n- $c$: number of cases who were unexposed.\n- $d$: number of controls who were unexposed.\n\nThe table is structured as:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n & \\text{Cases} & \\text{Controls} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Exposed} & a & b \\\\\n\\text{Unexposed} & c & d\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe odds of an event is the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring.
