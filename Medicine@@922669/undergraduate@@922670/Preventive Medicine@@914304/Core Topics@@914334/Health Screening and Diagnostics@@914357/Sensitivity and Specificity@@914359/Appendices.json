A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe operating characteristics of a diagnostic test are derived from a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table that cross-classifies the test results against a reference (or \"gold\") standard. The quantities provided are: True Positives ($\\mathrm{TP} = 180$), False Negatives ($\\mathrm{FN} = 20$), False Positives ($\\mathrm{FP} = 40$), and True Negatives ($\\mathrm{TN} = 760$).\n\nLet $D^+$ denote the event that an individual has the condition (disease present), and $D^-$ denote the event that an individual does not have the condition (disease absent), as determined by the reference standard. Let $T^+$ denote a positive test result and $T^-$ denote a negative test result.\n\nThe total number of individuals with the condition is the sum of true positives and false negatives:\n$$N_{D^+} = \\mathrm{TP} + \\mathrm{FN} = 180 + 20 = 200$$\nThe total number of individuals without the condition is the sum of false positives and true negatives:\n$$N_{D^-} = \\mathrm{FP} + \\mathrm{TN} = 40 + 760 = 800$$\n\nThe four operating characteristics are defined as conditional probabilities:\n\n1.  **Sensitivity ($\\mathrm{Se}$)**, also known as the True Positive Rate ($\\mathrm{TPR}$), is the probability of a positive test result given that the individual has the condition. It measures the test's ability to correctly identify those with the disease.\n    $$\\mathrm{Se} = P(T^+ | D^+) = \\frac{\\mathrm{TP}}{\\mathrm{TP} + \\mathrm{FN}}$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$\\mathrm{Se} = \\frac{180}{200} = 0.9$$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, $\\mathrm{Se} = 0.9000$.\n\n2.  **Specificity ($\\mathrm{Sp}$)**, also known as the True Negative Rate ($\\mathrm{TNR}$), is the probability of a negative test result given that the individual does not have the condition. It measures the test's ability to correctly identify those without the disease.\n    $$\\mathrm{Sp} = P(T^- | D^-) = \\frac{\\mathrm{TN}}{\\mathrm{FP} + \\mathrm{TN}}$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$\\mathrm{Sp} = \\frac{760}{800} = 0.95$$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, $\\mathrm{Sp} = 0.9500$.\n\n3.  **False Positive Rate ($\\mathrm{FPR}$)**, also known as the type I error rate, is the probability of a positive test result given that the individual does not have the condition. It is the complement of specificity.\n    $$\\mathrm{FPR} = P(T^+ | D^-) = \\frac{\\mathrm{FP}}{\\mathrm{FP} + \\mathrm{TN}} = 1 - \\mathrm{Sp}$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$\\mathrm{FPR} = \\frac{40}{800} = 0.05$$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, $\\mathrm{FPR} = 0.05000$.\n\n4.  **False Negative Rate ($\\mathrm{FNR}$)**, also known as the type II error rate, is the probability of a negative test result given that the individual has the condition. It is the complement of sensitivity.\n    $$\\mathrm{FNR} = P(T^- | D^+) = \\frac{\\mathrm{FN}}{\\mathrm{TP} + \\mathrm{FN}} = 1 - \\mathrm{Se}$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$\\mathrm{FNR} = \\frac{20}{200} = 0.1$$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, $\\mathrm{FNR} = 0.1000$.\n\n### Interpretation and Trade-off Analysis\nThe computed rates reveal the performance trade-offs of this rapid test.\n\n-   A sensitivity of $\\mathrm{Se} = 0.9000$ means the test correctly identifies $90\\%$ of all individuals who have the condition. Consequently, the false negative rate of $\\mathrm{FNR} = 0.1000$ signifies that $10\\%$ of individuals with the condition are missed by the test. These are the \"missed cases\" who are falsely reassured they are disease-free, which can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment.\n\n-   A specificity of $\\mathrm{Sp} = 0.9500$ means the test correctly identifies $95\\%$ of all individuals who do not have the condition. Consequently, the false positive rate of $\\mathrm{FPR} = 0.05000$ signifies that $5\\%$ of individuals without the condition receive a false positive result. These individuals are subjected to \"unnecessary follow-up,\" which may involve more invasive, costly, and anxiety-inducing confirmatory tests.\n\nThe trade-off is between minimizing missed cases (maximizing $\\mathrm{Se}$, minimizing $\\mathrm{FNR}$) and minimizing unnecessary follow-up (maximizing $\\mathrm{Sp}$, minimizing $\\mathrm{FPR}$). For a given test technology, increasing sensitivity often leads to a decrease in specificity, and vice versa. In this example, the test is highly specific ($\\mathrm{Sp}=0.9500$), indicating it is very good at ruling out the disease in healthy individuals, thus keeping the rate of false alarms low. Its sensitivity is also high ($\\mathrm{Se}=0.9000$), but not as high as its specificity, indicating a small but non-zero proportion of actual cases will be missed. The choice of this balance depends on the specific clinical context: the severity of the disease, the risks of a missed diagnosis, and the cost and risk of follow-up procedures for false positives.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.9000  0.9500  0.05000  0.1000 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4573913"}, {"introduction": "A test's intrinsic sensitivity and specificity are only part of the story; its true clinical utility depends on the prevalence of the disease in the population being tested.

We use Bayes' theorem to express this:\n$$P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{P(+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test. It can be found using the law of total probability, conditioning on the disease status:\n$$P(+) = P(+ \\mid D) P(D) + P(+ \\mid D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the defined terms ($\\mathrm{Se}$, $\\mathrm{Sp}$, $P(D)$):\n$$P(+) = (\\mathrm{Se})(P(D)) + (1 - \\mathrm{Sp})(1 - P(D))$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $P(+)$ back into the Bayes' theorem formula for PPV:\n$$\\mathrm{PPV} = P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot P(D)}{\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot P(D) + (1 - \\mathrm{Sp})(1 - P(D))}$$\nThis is the general expression for PPV in terms of $\\mathrm{Se}$, $\\mathrm{Sp}$, and $P(D)$.\n\n**Derivation of Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\n\nThe NPV is the probability that a person does not have the disease given that they tested negative, denoted as $P(D^c \\mid -)$. Again, we use Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D^c \\mid -) = \\frac{P(- \\mid D^c) P(D^c)}{P(-)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(-)$, is the overall probability of a negative test. Using the law of total probability:\n$$P(-) = P(- \\mid D^c) P(D^c) + P(- \\mid D) P(D)$$\nSubstituting the defined terms:\n$$P(-) = (\\mathrm{Sp})(1 - P(D)) + (1 - \\mathrm{Se})(P(D))$$\nSubstituting this expression for $P(-)$ back into the Bayes' theorem formula for NPV:\n$$\\mathrm{NPV} = P(D^c \\mid -) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Sp} \\cdot (1 - P(D))}{\\mathrm{Sp} \\cdot (1 - P(D)) + (1 - \\mathrm{Se})P(D)}$$\nThis is the general expression for NPV in terms of $\\mathrm{Se}$, $\\mathrm{Sp}$, and $P(D)$.\n\n**Numerical Computation**\n\nGiven values are $\\mathrm{Se}=0.92$, $\\mathrm{Sp}=0.88$, and $P(D)=0.05$. We also have:\n-   $1 - \\mathrm{Se} = 1 - 0.92 = 0.08$\n-   $1 - \\mathrm{Sp} = 1 - 0.88 = 0.12$\n-   $1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$\n\nComputing PPV:\n$$\\mathrm{PPV} = \\frac{0.92 \\cdot 0.05}{0.92 \\cdot 0.05 + (0.12) \\cdot 0.95} = \\frac{0.046}{0.046 + 0.114} = \\frac{0.046}{0.160} = 0.2875$$\n\nComputing NPV:\n$$\\mathrm{NPV} = \\frac{0.88 \\cdot 0.95}{0.88 \\cdot 0.95 + (0.08) \\cdot 0.05} = \\frac{0.836}{0.836 + 0.004} = \\frac{0.836}{0.840} \\approx 0.995238...$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures gives $\\mathrm{NPV} = 0.9952$.\n\n**Interpretation of PPV**\n\nThe calculated PPV is $0.2875$. This means that for an individual selected at random from this population who tests positive, the probability that they actually have the disease is only $28.75\\%$. The remaining $71.25\\%$ of positive tests are false positives. The low magnitude of the PPV, despite a reasonably high sensitivity and specificity of the test, is a direct consequence of the low prevalence ($5\\%$) of the disease in the population being screened. In a low-prevalence setting, the absolute number of disease-free individuals is much larger than the number of individuals with the disease. Consequently, even with a good specificity of $88\\%$, the number of false positives (from the large disease-free group) can be substantial and can overwhelm the number of true positives (from the small diseased group). This result underscores a critical principle in public health screening: a positive result from a screening test in a low-prevalence population is not, by itself, a definitive diagnosis and typically necessitates a follow-up, more accurate (often more invasive or expensive) confirmatory test. In contrast, the NPV is very high ($99.52\\%$), indicating that a negative test result is highly reliable in ruling out the disease.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0.2875  0.9952 \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4573911"}, {"introduction": "Sensitivity and specificity exist in a delicate balance, often governed by a test's decision threshold for a continuous biomarker.
