It provides all necessary information for a complete solution without any internal contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is a standard application of fundamental principles in biostatistics and epidemiology.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $D$: The event that an individual has the disease.\n- $D^c$: The event that an individual does not have the disease.\n- $T^+$: The event that the test result is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the test result is negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following definitions and values:\n- Sensitivity ($Se$): The probability that the test is positive among truly diseased individuals. In conditional probability notation, this is $Se = P(T^+ | D)$.\n- Specificity ($Sp$): The probability that the test is negative among truly non-diseased individuals. In conditional probability notation, this is $Sp = P(T^- | D^c)$.\n\nThe given values are $Se = 0.90$ and $Sp = 0.95$.\n\nThe task is to compute the positive likelihood ratio ($LR+$) and the negative likelihood ratio ($LR-$).\n\nThe positive likelihood ratio, $LR+$, is defined as the ratio of the probability of a positive test result in a diseased individual to the probability of a positive test result in a non-diseased individual.\n$$LR+ = \\frac{P(T^+ | D)}{P(T^+ | D^c)}$$\nThe numerator, $P(T^+ | D)$, is the sensitivity, $Se$.\nThe denominator, $P(T^+ | D^c)$, is the probability of a positive test in a non-diseased person, which is the false positive rate. Since for any conditional event, the sum of probabilities of all outcomes must be $1$, we have $P(T^+ | D^c) + P(T^- | D^c) = 1$. The term $P(T^- | D^c)$ is the specificity, $Sp$. Therefore, the false positive rate is $P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - Sp$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the formula for $LR+$:\n$$LR+ = \\frac{Se}{1 - Sp}$$\n\nUsing the provided numerical values:\n$$LR+ = \\frac{0.90}{1 - 0.95} = \\frac{0.90}{0.05} = 18$$\n\nThe negative likelihood ratio, $LR-$, is defined as the ratio of the probability of a negative test result in a diseased individual to the probability of a negative test result in a non-diseased individual.\n$$LR- = \\frac{P(T^- | D)}{P(T^- | D^c)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^- | D^c)$, is the specificity, $Sp$.\nThe numerator, $P(T^- | D)$, is the probability of a negative test in a diseased person, which is the false negative rate. Using the same logic as before, $P(T^+ | D) + P(T^- | D) = 1$. The term $P(T^+ | D)$ is the sensitivity, $Se$. Therefore, the false negative rate is $P(T^- | D) = 1 - Se$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the formula for $LR-$:\n$$LR- = \\frac{1 - Se}{Sp}$$\n\nUsing the provided numerical values:\n$$LR- = \\frac{1 - 0.90}{0.95} = \\frac{0.10}{0.95}$$\n$$LR- \\approx 0.105263157...$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get $LR- = 0.1053$.\n\nThe final numerical results are $LR+ = 18$ and $LR- \\approx 0.1053$.

The relationship is: Post-test Odds = Pre-test Odds $\\times$ Likelihood Ratio.\n- A positive result ($T^+$) corresponds to $LR+ = 18.00$. This means that a positive test result increases the odds of having the disease by a factor of $18$. In clinical practice, an $LR+  10$ is considered to provide strong evidence to rule in the disease. Thus, a positive result from this test is a strong indicator that the person has the disease.\n- A negative result ($T^-$) corresponds to $LR- = 0.1053$. This means that a negative test result multiplies the pre-test odds of having the disease by $0.1053$. An $LR-  0.1$ is generally considered strong evidence to rule out the disease. The value of $0.1053$ is very close to this threshold and indicates that a negative test result provides moderate-to-strong evidence against the presence of the disease, substantially decreasing its likelihood.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 18.00  0.1053 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4557276"}, {"introduction": "With the diagnostic power of a test captured by its likelihood ratio, we can now apply it to update our assessment of a patient's risk.

We shall proceed with a complete solution.\n\nLet $D$ denote the event that an individual has the disease, and let $D^c$ denote the complement event that the individual does not have the disease. Let $T+$ denote the event of a positive test result and $T-$ denote the event of a negative test result.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n- The prevalence of the disease: $P(D) = \\pi = 0.001$.\n- The sensitivity of the test: $P(T+ \\mid D) = Se = 0.95$.\n- The specificity of the test: $P(T- \\mid D^c) = Sp = 0.98$.\n\nFrom these, we can deduce two other necessary probabilities:\n- The probability of not having the disease: $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - \\pi = 1 - 0.001 = 0.999$.\n- The probability of a positive test given no disease (the false positive rate): $P(T+ \\mid D^c) = 1 - P(T- \\mid D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$.\n\nThe primary goal is to derive and calculate the positive predictive value (PPV), defined as the probability of having the disease given a positive test result, $PPV = P(D \\mid T+)$. We will use Bayes' rule for this derivation.\n\nBayes' rule states:\n$$P(D \\mid T+) = \\frac{P(T+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result.

The reason is rooted in the extremely low prevalence (or base rate) of the disease, a principle captured mathematically by Bayes' rule.\n\nWe can analyze this using the odds form of Bayes' rule. The posterior odds of disease given a positive test are the prior odds of disease multiplied by the likelihood ratio for a positive test ($LR+$).\n$$ \\frac{P(D \\mid T+)}{P(D^c \\mid T+)} = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)} \\times \\frac{P(T+ \\mid D)}{P(T+ \\mid D^c)} $$\nThe terms are:\n- Prior odds of disease: $\\frac{\\pi}{1 - \\pi} = \\frac{0.001}{0.999} \\approx \\frac{1}{999}$. These odds are very low, reflecting the rarity of the condition.\n- Likelihood ratio for a positive test: $LR+ = \\frac{Se}{1 - Sp} = \\frac{0.95}{0.02} = 47.5$. This value indicates that a positive test is $47.5$ times more likely to occur in someone with the disease than in someone without it. This represents the diagnostic strength of the test.\n\nThe posterior odds are thus:\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds} = \\left(\\frac{0.001}{0.999}\\right) \\times 47.5 \\approx 0.0475475 $$\nWhile the test provides strong evidence ($LR+ = 47.5$), it is updating an extremely low prior belief. The resulting posterior odds are still low (less than $1:20$). Converting these odds back to a probability gives the PPV:\n$$PPV = \\frac{\\text{Posterior Odds}}{1 + \\text{Posterior Odds}} \\approx \\frac{0.0475475}{1.0475475} \\approx 0.04539$$\nThe final probability remains low because the initial probability was exceptionally low.\n\nTo make this more concrete, consider a hypothetical population of $1,000,000$ individuals.\n- Number of individuals with the disease (true cases): $1,000,000 \\times \\pi = 1,000,000 \\times 0.001 = 1,000$.\n- Number of individuals without the disease (healthy cases): $1,000,000 \\times (1 - \\pi) = 1,000,000 \\times 0.999 = 999,000$.\n\nNow we screen this entire population:\n- **True Positives (TP)**: The number of diseased individuals who test positive is $1,000 \\times Se = 1,000 \\times 0.95 = 950$.\n- **False Positives (FP)**: The number of healthy individuals who test positive is $999,000 \\times (1 - Sp) = 999,000 \\times 0.02 = 19,980$.\n\nThe total number of individuals who test positive is the sum of true positives and false positives: $TP + FP = 950 + 19,980 = 20,930$.\n\nThe PPV is the fraction of positive tests that are actual true positives:\n$$ PPV = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP} = \\frac{950}{20,930} \\approx 0.04539 $$\nThis calculation reveals the core issue: because the disease is rare, the cohort of healthy individuals ($999,000$) is vastly larger than the cohort of diseased individuals ($1,000$). Even with a low false positive rate of $2\\%$, applying it to this enormous healthy population generates a very large absolute number of false positives ($19,980$). This number of false positives completely overwhelms the number of true positives ($950$). Consequently, any given positive test result is far more likely to be a false positive from a healthy person than a true positive from a sick person.
