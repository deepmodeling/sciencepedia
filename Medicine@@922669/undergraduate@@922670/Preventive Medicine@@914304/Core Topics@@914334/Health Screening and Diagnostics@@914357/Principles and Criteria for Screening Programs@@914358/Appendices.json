The derivation proceeds from the given definitions.\n\nThe population size is standardized to $100,000$ persons. The incidence rate, $I$, is defined as the number of new cases per $100,000$ persons per year. Therefore, within our standardized population, the expected number of new cases of the disease in one year is simply $I$.\n$$\n\\text{Expected number of new cases per year} = I\n$$\nThe case-fatality proportion, $p_f$, is the proportion of incident cases that result in death. To find the expected number of deaths per year from the disease in our population, we multiply the expected number of new cases by the case-fatality proportion.\n$$\n\\text{Expected number of fatal cases per year} = I \\times p_f\n$$\nThe problem states that the analysis of disease burden is restricted to mortality. Each fatal case contributes an average of $d$ Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs).

The units for $I$ are cases per $100,000$ person-years, $p_f$ is a dimensionless proportion (deaths per case), and $d$ has units of DALYs per death. The resulting units for $D$ are DALYs per $100,000$ person-years, which is consistent with the problem's framework.\n\nThe second task is to compute the value of $D$ using the provided data:\n- Incidence rate, $I = 50$\n- Case-fatality proportion, $p_f = 0.20$\n- Average DALYs per fatal case, $d = 5$\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived expression for $D$:\n$$\nD = 50 \\times 0.20 \\times 5\n$$\n$$\nD = 10 \\times 5\n$$\n$$\nD = 50\n$$\nSo, the expected annual DALYs lost are $50$ per $100,000$ person-years.\n\nThe final task is to compute the ratio $R = D / \\Theta$, where $\\Theta$ is the policy threshold for public health importance.\nThe given threshold is $\\Theta = 50$ DALYs per $100,000$ person-years.\n$$\nR = \\frac{D}{\\Theta} = \\frac{50}{50} = 1\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be reported to three significant figures.

Expected Number of Confirmatory Tests**\nAccording to the problem, all individuals who test positive on the initial screening are referred for a confirmatory test. The observed positivity rate for the initial screen is given as $r = 0.05$. Therefore, the expected number of individuals testing positive in a population of size $N$ is $N \\times r$.

We seek the expected number of individuals in the population of $N=1000$ who satisfy all three conditions: $D^c$, $T_1^+$, and $T_2^+$.\n\nLet $N_{FP, conf}$ be this expected number.\n$$N_{FP, conf} = N \\times P(D^c \\cap T_1^+ \\cap T_2^+)$$\nUsing the chain rule for probability:\n$$P(D^c \\cap T_1^+ \\cap T_2^+) = P(T_2^+ | D^c \\cap T_1^+) \\times P(T_1^+ | D^c) \\times P(D^c)$$\nA standard assumption in multi-stage testing is that the tests are conditionally independent given the disease status. This means the result of the second test for a non-diseased person does not depend on their result from the first test. Thus, $P(T_2^+ | D^c \\cap T_1^+) = P(T_2^+ | D^c)$.\nThe term $P(T_2^+ | D^c)$ is the probability of a positive confirmatory test given the individual is non-diseased, which is by definition $1 - sp_2$.\nThe term $P(T_1^+ | D^c)$ is the probability of a positive initial test given the individual is non-diseased, which is $1 - sp_1$.\nThe term $P(D^c)$ is the probability of not having the disease, which is $1 - p$.\n\nThe expression for the probability becomes:\n$$P(D^c \\cap T_1^+ \\cap T_2^+) = (1 - sp_2) \\times (1 - sp_1) \\times (1 - p)$$\nWe are given $sp_2=0.99$ and $p=0.01$, but $sp_1$ is unknown.
