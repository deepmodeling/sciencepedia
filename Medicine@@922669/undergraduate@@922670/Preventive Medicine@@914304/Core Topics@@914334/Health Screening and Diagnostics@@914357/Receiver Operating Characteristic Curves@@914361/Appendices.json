Summing gives $\\mathrm{AUC}_B = 77/150 + 9/100 + 11/75 = 154/300 + 27/300 + 44/300 = 225/300 = 3/4 = 0.75$.\n\nHence $\\mathrm{AUC}_A = \\mathrm{AUC}_B = 3/4$, even though the ROC curves cross as shown in Step 1.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate expected loss $L(t)$ under the two specified clinical scenarios, and choose the loss-minimizing threshold for each test.\n\nBy definition,\n$$L(t) = (1 - \\pi)\\, C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\times \\mathrm{FPR}(t) + \\pi\\, C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\times \\bigl(1 - \\mathrm{TPR}(t)\\bigr).$$\n\nScenario 1: $\\pi = 0.05$, $C_{\\mathrm{FP}} = 5$, $C_{\\mathrm{FN}} = 1$.\n\nCommon false positive rates: $\\mathrm{FPR}(2) = 0.1$, $\\mathrm{FPR}(1) = 0.4$.\n\n- Test A:\n  - $L_A(2) = (1 - 0.05)\\cdot 5 \\cdot 0.1 + 0.05 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1 - 0.3) = 0.95 \\cdot 0.5 + 0.05 \\cdot 0.7 = 0.475 + 0.035 = 0.51$.\n  - $L_A(1) = 0.95 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 0.4 + 0.05 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1 - 13/15) = 1.9 + 0.05 \\cdot (2/15) \\approx 1.9 + 0.006\\overline{6} \\approx 1.906\\overline{6}$.\n  Loss-minimizing threshold is $t=2$ for Test A.\n\n- Test B:\n  - $L_B(2) = 0.95 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 0.1 + 0.05 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1 - 0.1) = 0.475 + 0.05 \\cdot 0.9 = 0.475 + 0.045 = 0.52$.\n  - $L_B(1) = 0.95 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 0.4 + 0.05 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1 - 43/45) = 1.9 + 0.05 \\cdot (2/45) \\approx 1.9 + 0.002\\overline{2} \\approx 1.902\\overline{2}$.\n  Loss-minimizing threshold is $t=2$ for Test B.\n\nComparison at the minimizing thresholds: $L_A(2) = 0.51  L_B(2) = 0.52$, so Test A yields lower expected loss.\n\nScenario 2: $\\pi = 0.3$, $C_{\\mathrm{FP}} = 1$, $C_{\\mathrm{FN}} = 10$.\n\n- Test A:\n  - $L_A(2) = (1 - 0.3)\\cdot 1 \\cdot 0.1 + 0.3 \\cdot 10 \\cdot (1 - 0.3) = 0.7 \\cdot 0.1 + 3 \\cdot 0.7 = 0.07 + 2.1 = 2.17$.\n  - $L_A(1) = 0.7 \\cdot 0.4 + 3 \\cdot (1 - 13/15) = 0.28 + 3 \\cdot (2/15) = 0.28 + 6/15 = 0.28 + 0.4 = 0.68$.\n  Loss-minimizing threshold is $t=1$ for Test A.\n\n- Test B:\n  - $L_B(2) = 0.7 \\cdot 0.1 + 3 \\cdot (1 - 0.1) = 0.07 + 2.7 = 2.77$.\n  - $L_B(1) = 0.7 \\cdot 0.4 + 3 \\cdot (1 - 43/45) = 0.28 + 3 \\cdot (2/45) = 0.28 + 6/45 = 0.28 + 2/15 \\approx 0.28 + 0.133\\overline{3} \\approx 0.413\\overline{3}$.\n  Loss-minimizing threshold is $t=1$ for Test B.\n\nComparison at the minimizing thresholds: $L_A(1) = 0.68$ versus $L_B(1) \\approx 0.413\\overline{3}$; hence Test B yields lower expected loss.\n\nStep 4: Option-by-option analysis.\n\n- Option A: We have shown $\\mathrm{AUC}_A = \\mathrm{AUC}_B = 3/4$, and the ROC points at $\\mathrm{FPR} = 0.1$ and $\\mathrm{FPR} = 0.4$ satisfy $\\mathrm{TPR}_A(0.1) = 0.3  0.1 = \\mathrm{TPR}_B(0.1)$ and $\\mathrm{TPR}_A(0.4) = 13/15 \\approx 0.866\\overline{6}  43/45 \\approx 0.955\\overline{5} = \\mathrm{TPR}_B(0.4)$. Therefore the ROC curves cross and the statement is satisfied. Verdict: Correct.\n\n- Option B: Under $\\pi = 0.05$, $C_{\\mathrm{FP}} = 5$, $C_{\\mathrm{FN}} = 1$, we found the loss-minimizing threshold is $t=2$ for both tests, not $t=1$, and $L_A(2)  L_B(2)$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- Option C: Under the same low-prevalence, high false positive cost scenario, both tests minimize loss at $t=2$, and Test A yields lower expected loss than Test B. Verdict: Correct.\n\n- Option D: Equal area under the curve does not imply superiority at all thresholds; in fact, the ROC curves cross and, under $\\pi = 0.3$, $C_{\\mathrm{FP}} = 1$, $C_{\\mathrm{FN}} = 10$, both tests minimize loss at $t=1$, with Test B having lower expected loss. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- Option E: Under $\\pi = 0.3$, $C_{\\mathrm{FP}} = 1$, $C_{\\mathrm{FN}} = 10$, both tests minimize loss at $t=1$, and Test B has lower expected loss than Test A.
