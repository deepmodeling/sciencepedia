It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a clear, self-contained description of a standard epidemiological model and asks for formal derivations based on fundamental principles. All necessary parameters and definitions are provided. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem describes a Susceptible-Infectious-Removed ($S$-$I$-$R$) model for an infectious agent. Individuals leave the Infectious ($I$) compartment and enter the Removed ($R$) compartment via two independent processes: clinical recovery, at a rate $\\gamma$, and decolonization, at a rate $\\sigma$. The total rate at which an infectious individual is removed from the infectious population is the sum of these two rates, $\\gamma + \\sigma$. The time an individual spends in the infectious state is therefore an exponentially distributed random variable with a rate parameter of $\\lambda = \\gamma + \\sigma$. The mean duration of this infectious period, denoted $\\tau_I$, is the reciprocal of this rate:\n$$\n\\tau_I = \\frac{1}{\\gamma + \\sigma}\n$$\n\nThe solution is derived in three parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Basic Reproduction Number, $R_0$**\n\nThe Basic Reproduction Number, $R_0$, is defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a single typical infectious individual introduced into a completely susceptible population. This can be calculated as the product of the rate at which an infectious individual generates new infections and the mean duration of the infectious period.\n\n$R_0 = (\\text{rate of new infections per infectious individual}) \\times (\\text{mean duration of infectiousness})$\n\nIn a completely susceptible population, the fraction of susceptible individuals is $S=1$. The rate of new infections generated by a single infectious individual is the product of the effective contact-driven transmission rate, $\\beta$, and the fraction of susceptible individuals, $S$.\n$$\n\\text{Rate of new infections per infectious individual} = \\beta \\times S = \\beta \\times 1 = \\beta\n$$\nThe mean duration of infectiousness, as established above, is $\\tau_I = \\frac{1}{\\gamma + \\sigma}$.\n\nCombining these two factors gives the expression for $R_0$:\n$$\nR_0 = \\beta \\times \\tau_I = \\beta \\left( \\frac{1}{\\gamma + \\sigma} \\right) = \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma + \\sigma}\n$$\nThis is the first required expression.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the minimal decolonization rate, $\\sigma^{\\ast}$**\n\nAn epidemic is prevented from growing if the Basic Reproduction Number is less than or equal to one, i.e., $R_0 \\leq 1$. Using the derived expression for $R_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma + \\sigma} \\leq 1\n$$\nSince $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, and $\\sigma$ are rates, they are non-negative quantities. Thus, the denominator $(\\gamma+\\sigma)$ is positive (assuming some removal mechanism exists). We can multiply both sides of the inequality by $(\\gamma + \\sigma)$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$\n\\beta \\leq \\gamma + \\sigma\n$$\nTo find the minimal decolonization rate $\\sigma^{\\ast}$ that is sufficient to ensure this condition is met, we consider the threshold case where equality holds:\n$$\n\\beta = \\gamma + \\sigma^{\\ast}\n$$\nSolving for $\\sigma^{\\ast}$ yields:\n$$\n\\sigma^{\\ast} = \\beta - \\gamma\n$$\nThis represents the minimal required decolonization rate to bring $R_0$ down to $1$. It is physically meaningful if $\\beta  \\gamma$, which corresponds to a situation where the transmission rate is greater than the natural recovery rate, making an outbreak possible without intervention ($\\sigma=0$). If $\\beta \\leq \\gamma$, the condition $R_0 \\leq 1$ is already satisfied even with $\\sigma=0$, and thus the minimal required decolonization rate is $0$. The formal expression $\\beta - \\gamma$ represents the intervention effort required at the critical threshold.\n\n**Part 3: Derivation of the minimal fractional reduction in contact rate, $f^{\\ast}$**\n\nA control measure reduces the effective contact rate $\\beta$ by a fractional amount $f$, where $0 \\leq f \\leq 1$. The new contact rate, which we can call $\\beta'$, is:\n$$\n\\beta' = (1 - f)\\beta\n$$\nThe new Basic Reproduction Number, $R_0'$, is calculated using this new rate:\n$$\nR_0' = \\frac{\\beta'}{\\gamma + \\sigma} = \\frac{(1 - f)\\beta}{\\gamma + \\sigma}\n$$\nThe prevention condition requires $R_0' \\leq 1$:\n$$\n\\frac{(1 - f)\\beta}{\\gamma + \\sigma} \\leq 1\n$$\nTo find the minimal fractional reduction $f^{\\ast}$ that satisfies this condition, we again solve for the threshold case where $R_0' = 1$:\n$$\n\\frac{(1 - f^{\\ast})\\beta}{\\gamma + \\sigma} = 1\n$$\nSolving for $f^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n1 - f^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\gamma + \\sigma}{\\beta}\n$$\n$$\nf^{\\ast} = 1 - \\frac{\\gamma + \\sigma}{\\beta}\n$$\nThis expression gives the minimum fractional reduction in transmission necessary to halt the epidemic. This is a standard result in epidemiology, often referred to as the critical intervention coverage. This value is between $0$ and $1$ if the original $R_0 = \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma + \\sigma}  1$. If the original $R_0 \\leq 1$, the formula yields a non-positive value, correctly implying that the minimal required reduction is $f^{\\ast}=0$.\n\nThe three derived expressions are collected for the final answer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma + \\sigma}  \\beta - \\gamma  1 - \\frac{\\gamma + \\sigma}{\\beta} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4503328"}, {"introduction": "Why do antibiotics sometimes fail in a patient even when the pathogen is susceptible in lab tests?

Consider a bloodstream infection due to an enzyme-producing bacterium that degrades a beta-lactam antibiotic. The antibiotic is administered by constant intravenous infusion at rate $I$ into a well-mixed compartment of volume $V$. The free drug concentration $C(t)$ follows mass balance with two removal processes: host clearance with first-order rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{el}}$ and bacterial enzyme-mediated degradation that is proportional to bacterial density $n$ (cells per unit volume), with proportionality constant $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires formulating and solving a system of equations based on first principles of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.\n\nFirst, we establish the mass balance equation for the free drug concentration, $C(t)$, in the compartment of volume $V$. The rate of change of the total amount of drug in the compartment, $V \\frac{dC}{dt}$, is the difference between the rate of drug infusion and the rates of drug removal.\n$$ V \\frac{dC}{dt} = (\\text{Rate In}) - (\\text{Rate Out}) $$\nThe rate in is the constant intravenous infusion rate, $I$.\nThe rates out consist of two processes:\n$1$. Host clearance, a first-order process with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{el}}$. The rate is $k_{\\mathrm{el}} C V$.\n$2$. Bacterial degradation. The problem states this is proportional to the bacterial density $n$ and the drug concentration $C$. The total rate of degradation is given by the product of the degradation constant $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$, the bacterial density $n$, the drug concentration $C$, and the volume $V$. The rate is $k_{\\mathrm{deg}} n C V$. This form is consistent with the provided units, as will be shown later.\n\nCombining these terms, the full differential equation for drug concentration is:\n$$ V \\frac{dC}{dt} = I - k_{\\mathrm{el}}CV - k_{\\mathrm{deg}}nCV $$\nThe problem specifies assuming a quasi-steady-state for the drug concentration, which means $\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0$. This is a reasonable assumption when drug kinetics are much faster than bacterial population dynamics.\n$$ 0 = I - k_{\\mathrm{el}}CV - k_{\\mathrm{deg}}nCV = I - CV(k_{\\mathrm{el}} + k_{\\mathrm{deg}}n) $$\nSolving for the steady-state drug concentration $C$ as a function of bacterial density $n$ gives:\n$$ C(n) = \\frac{I}{V(k_{\\mathrm{el}} + k_{\\mathrm{deg}}n)} $$\nThis equation quantitatively describes the inoculum effect: as the bacterial density $n$ increases, the steady-state drug concentration $C$ decreases.\n\nNext, we formulate the equation for the net growth rate of the bacterial population. The population density $n$ changes according to its intrinsic growth rate, reduced by the killing effect of the antibiotic.\n$$ \\frac{dn}{dt} = (\\text{Net Growth Rate}) \\cdot n $$\nThe net growth rate is the difference between the intrinsic growth rate $r_{\\mathrm{g}}$ and the antibiotic-induced kill rate, which follows a saturable Emax model:\n$$ \\text{Net Growth Rate} = r_{\\mathrm{g}} - \\frac{E_{\\max}C}{EC_{50} + C} $$\nThe threshold bacterial density $n^{\\ast}$ is defined as the density at which this net growth rate is exactly zero. This is the tipping point; for any density $n  n^{\\ast}$, the net growth rate will be positive, and the infection will progress despite treatment. Setting the net growth rate to zero, we can solve for the drug concentration, $C^{\\ast}$, required to achieve this state of zero net growth (bacteriostasis).\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{g}} - \\frac{E_{\\max}C^{\\ast}}{EC_{50} + C^{\\ast}} = 0 $$\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{g}} = \\frac{E_{\\max}C^{\\ast}}{EC_{50} + C^{\\ast}} $$\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{g}}(EC_{50} + C^{\\ast}) = E_{\\max}C^{\\ast} $$\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{g}}EC_{50} = (E_{\\max} - r_{\\mathrm{g}})C^{\\ast} $$\nThis gives the critical drug concentration:\n$$ C^{\\ast} = \\frac{r_{\\mathrm{g}}EC_{50}}{E_{\\max} - r_{\\mathrm{g}}} $$\nFor the condition to be meaningful, we must have $E_{\\max}  r_{\\mathrm{g}}$, which is true for the given parameters ($2.00\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}  0.80\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$).\n\nThe threshold density $n^{\\ast}$ is the specific density that reduces the steady-state drug concentration to this critical value, i.e., $C(n^{\\ast}) = C^{\\ast}$.\n$$ \\frac{I}{V(k_{\\mathrm{el}} + k_{\\mathrm{deg}}n^{\\ast})} = \\frac{r_{\\mathrm{g}}EC_{50}}{E_{\\max} - r_{\\mathrm{g}}} $$\nWe now solve this equation for $n^{\\ast}$:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{el}} + k_{\\mathrm{deg}}n^{\\ast} = \\frac{I(E_{\\max} - r_{\\mathrm{g}})}{V r_{\\mathrm{g}} EC_{50}} $$\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{deg}}n^{\\ast} = \\frac{I(E_{\\max} - r_{\\mathrm{g}})}{V r_{\\mathrm{g}} EC_{50}} - k_{\\mathrm{el}} $$\nThe explicit expression for the threshold bacterial density is:\n$$ n^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{deg}}} \\left[ \\frac{I(E_{\\max} - r_{\\mathrm{g}})}{V r_{\\mathrm{g}} EC_{50}} - k_{\\mathrm{el}} \\right] $$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nWe will perform the calculation using a consistent set of units: milligrams (mg), milliliters (mL), and hours (h).\nThe given parameters are:\n- $I = 60\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n- $V = 20\\,\\mathrm{L} = 20 \\times 1000\\,\\mathrm{mL} = 20000\\,\\mathrm{mL}$\n- $k_{\\mathrm{el}} = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n- $k_{\\mathrm{deg}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{CFU}^{-1}$\n- $r_{\\mathrm{g}} = 0.80\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n- $E_{\\max} = 2.00\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n- $EC_{50} = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1} = 10.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1} = 0.010\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the term inside the brackets:\n$$ \\frac{I(E_{\\max} - r_{\\mathrm{g}})}{V r_{\\mathrm{g}} EC_{50}} = \\frac{60 \\cdot (2.00 - 0.80)}{20000 \\cdot 0.80 \\cdot 0.010} = \\frac{60 \\cdot 1.20}{20000 \\cdot 0.0080} = \\frac{72}{160} = 0.45\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} $$\nNow, we substitute this value back into the expression for $n^{\\ast}$:\n$$ n^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{1.0 \\times 10^{-9}} \\left[ 0.45 - 0.25 \\right] $$\n$$ n^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{1.0 \\times 10^{-9}} \\left[ 0.20 \\right] $$\n$$ n^{\\ast} = 0.20 \\times 10^{9} = 2.0 \\times 10^{8} \\,\\mathrm{CFU}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1} $$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, the result is $2.00 \\times 10^{8} \\,\\mathrm{CFU}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$.\n\nThis value of $n^{\\ast}$ represents a critical threshold. If the bacterial load in an infection exceeds this density, the antibiotic degradation will be so rapid that the drug concentration cannot reach the level required to halt bacterial growth, leading to treatment failure. This highlights the importance of preventive and early-intervention strategies in medicine. Measures like \"source control\" (e.g., surgical drainage of abscesses, removal of infected devices) are critical because they physically reduce the bacterial density $n$ to a level well below $n^{\\ast}$, thereby restoring the efficacy of the antibiotic treatment. Timely administration of antibiotics, before the bacterial population can grow to such high densities, is similarly crucial.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.00 \\times 10^8}$$", "id": "4503314"}]}
