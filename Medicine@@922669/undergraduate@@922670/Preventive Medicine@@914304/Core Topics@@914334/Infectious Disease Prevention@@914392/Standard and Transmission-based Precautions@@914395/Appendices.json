It is based on the standard well-mixed room model used in ventilation engineering and epidemiology, which relies on the fundamental principle of conservation of mass. All terms are clearly defined, and the required tasks are logically structured, leading to a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe solution is organized into the three tasks specified in the problem statement.\n\nTask 1: Derivation of Air Changes per Hour ($ACH$)\n\nThe Air Changes per Hour, denoted as $ACH$, is defined as the number of times the total volume of air in a room is replaced in one hour. The room volume is given as $V$, and the volumetric flow rate of air being exhausted is $Q$.\n\nLet us first consider the case where $Q$ is given in units of $\\mathrm{m^{3}/h}$. In a time interval of one hour ($1\\,\\mathrm{h}$), the total volume of air exhausted from the room is $Q \\times 1\\,\\mathrm{h}$. To find the number of air changes, we divide this exhausted volume by the room volume $V$:\n$$\nACH = \\frac{Q \\text{ [in m}^3\\text{/h]} \\times 1\\,\\mathrm{h}}{V \\text{ [in m}^3\\text{]}} = \\frac{Q}{V}\n$$\nThe resulting units for $ACH$ are $(\\mathrm{m^{3}/h}) / \\mathrm{m^{3}} = \\mathrm{h^{-1}}$, which is consistent with the definition of \"per hour\".\n\nNext, we consider the case where the flow rate is reported in $\\mathrm{m^{3}/\\text{minute}}$. Let's denote this flow rate as $Q_{\\text{min}}$. To use this in the expression for $ACH$, we must convert its units to $\\mathrm{m^{3}/h}$. Since there are $60$ minutes in $1$ hour, the conversion is:\n$$\nQ \\text{ [in m}^3\\text{/h]} = Q_{\\text{min}} \\text{ [in m}^3\\text{/min]} \\times \\frac{60\\,\\mathrm{min}}{1\\,\\mathrm{h}} = 60 \\, Q_{\\text{min}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $ACH$:\n$$\nACH = \\frac{60 \\, Q_{\\text{min}}}{V}\n$$\nTherefore, when $Q$ is reported in $\\mathrm{m^{3}/\\text{minute}}$, a conversion factor of $60$ must be applied to correctly calculate the $ACH$ in units of $\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$.\n\nTask 2: Numerical Calculation of $ACH$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Room volume, $V = 40\\,\\mathrm{m^{3}}$\n- Exhaust flow rate, $Q = 200\\,\\mathrm{m^{3}/h}$\n\nUsing the derived expression from Task 1 for $Q$ in $\\mathrm{m^{3}/h}$:\n$$\nACH = \\frac{Q}{V}\n$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\nACH = \\frac{200\\,\\mathrm{m^{3}/h}}{40\\,\\mathrm{m^{3}}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}\n$$\nThus, the Air Changes per Hour for the specified room is exactly $5$.\n\nTask 3: Governing Differential Equation and Steady-State Analysis\n\nWe apply the principle of conservation of mass for the airborne quanta within the well-mixed control volume $V$. The mass balance equation is:\nRate of Accumulation = Rate of Generation - Rate of Removal\n\nLet $C(t)$ be the concentration of quanta (quanta/$\\mathrm{m^{3}}$) at time $t$.\n- The total number of quanta in the room is $N(t) = V C(t)$. The rate of accumulation is $\\frac{dN}{dt} = V \\frac{dC}{dt}$, since $V$ is constant.\n- The rate of generation is given as a constant source term, $S$ (quanta/hour).\n- The rate of removal by ventilation is the product of the exhaust flow rate $Q$ and the concentration $C(t)$, since the room is assumed to be well-mixed. Rate of Removal = $Q C(t)$. We assume the incoming supply air is free of quanta.\n\nCombining these terms gives the governing first-order linear differential equation:\n$$\nV \\frac{dC}{dt} = S - Q C(t)\n$$\nThis can be rearranged into the standard form:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{Q}{V} C(t) = \\frac{S}{V}\n$$\nAt steady-state, the concentration no longer changes with time, meaning it reaches a constant value $C^{*}$. Mathematically, this condition is $\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0$. Substituting this into the differential equation:\n$$\nV \\frac{dC_s}{dt} = 0 = S - Q C^{*}\n$$\nSolving for the steady-state concentration $C^{*}$:\n$$\nQ C^{*} = S \\implies C^{*} = \\frac{S}{Q}\n$$\nTo connect this to $ACH$, we recall from Task 1 that $Q = V \\times ACH$. Substituting this into the expression for $C^{*}$ yields $C^{*} = \\frac{S}{V \\times ACH}$. This expression shows that for a constant source rate $S$ and room volume $V$, the steady-state quanta concentration $C^{*}$ is inversely proportional to the $ACH$. Therefore, increasing the $ACH$ directly decreases the steady-state concentration of infectious quanta through enhanced dilution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "4578444"}, {"introduction": "While steady-state concentration is important, infection control often involves managing transient events, such as clearing a room after an aerosol-generating procedure. Building on the concept of $ACH$, this exercise focuses on the decay dynamics of airborne contaminants once the source is removed.

We apply the principle of mass balance to the number of infectious quanta, $N$, in the room of volume $V$. The concentration is $C = N/V$. The governing differential equation for a well-mixed space is:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = \\text{Source Rate} - \\text{Removal Rate} $$\nIn terms of concentration, this is written as:\n$$ V \\frac{dC}{dt} = \\text{Source Rate} - (\\text{Removal Rate per unit concentration}) \\times C $$\nThe source rate is the emission from the infectious individual, given by the product of the number of infectious individuals, $I$, and their quanta emission rate, $q$.\n$$ \\text{Source Rate} = Iq $$\nThe removal rate is the sum of removal by mechanical ventilation and by the HEPA filtration unit.\nThe removal rate from mechanical ventilation is determined by the room's air change rate. The problem states there are $N_{ACH} = 12$ air changes per hour. The volumetric flow rate of this ventilation is $Q_{vent} = N_{ACH} \\times V$.\nThe removal rate from the HEPA filter is its clean air delivery rate (CADR).

The average number of infectious quanta inhaled by the susceptible healthcare worker over the exposure time $t$ is the \"dose\", which we will denote as $\\lambda_d$.

The probability of this event, $P_{inf}$, is the complement of inhaling zero quanta ($k=0$).\n$$ P_{inf} = P(k \\ge 1) = 1 - P(k=0) $$\nThe probability of inhaling zero quanta is:\n$$ P(k=0) = \\frac{\\lambda_d^0 \\exp(-\\lambda_d)}{0!} = \\exp(-\\lambda_d) $$\nTherefore, the probability of infection is given by the Wells-Riley equation:\n$$ P_{inf} = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_d) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Iqpt}{Q}\\right) $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value for the given parameters: $p=0.5 \\ \\mathrm{m}^{3}/\\mathrm{h}$ and $t=1.5 \\ \\mathrm{h}$.\nFirst, calculate the dose $\\lambda_d$:\n$$ \\lambda_d = \\frac{1 \\times 25 \\times 0.5 \\times 1.5}{645} = \\frac{18.75}{645} = \\frac{75/4}{645} = \\frac{75}{4 \\times 645} = \\frac{75}{2580} = \\frac{5}{172} $$\nThe probability of infection is:\n$$ P_{inf} = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{5}{172}\\right) $$\nNumerically, $\\frac{5}{172} \\approx 0.029069767...$\n$$ P_{inf} \\approx 1 - \\exp(-0.029069767) \\approx 1 - 0.97135064 \\approx 0.02864936 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.02865$.\n\nFinally, we conceptually identify how each parameter can be modulated by standard and transmission-based precautions.\n- $I$ (Number of infectious individuals): In an AIIR for a single patient, $I$ is fixed at $1$. Transmission-based precautions, specifically administrative controls like rapid diagnosis and isolation, aim to maintain $I=1$ and prevent the virus from spreading to other occupants, which would increase $I$. Standard precautions (e.g., hand hygiene) prevent the healthcare worker from becoming a new source.\n- $q$ (Quanta emission rate): This parameter is targeted by source control. A key transmission-based precaution is having the patient wear a mask (e.g., a surgical mask), which directly reduces the rate of aerosol emission, lowering $q$. Standard precautions also contribute, such as promoting respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette (e.g., coughing into an elbow), which reduces the forceful expulsion of infectious droplets.\n- $p$ (Pulmonary ventilation rate): The breathing rate itself is a physiological constant and cannot be easily changed. However, the effective exposure is modulated by Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), a cornerstone of transmission-based precautions. A well-fitted N95 respirator filters inhaled air, drastically reducing the number of quanta that reach the respiratory tract. This is mathematically equivalent to reducing $p$ by the filter's efficiency.\n- $t$ (Exposure time): This is managed by administrative controls, which are a form of transmission-based precaution. Strategies to reduce $t$ include limiting a worker's time inside the room, bundling patient care activities to minimize the frequency and duration of entries, and assigning dedicated staff to minimize traffic.\n- $Q$ (Total clean air delivery rate): This is an engineering control, a primary component of transmission-based precautions for airborne pathogens. The rate $Q$ is increased by maximizing the outdoor air exchange rate (enhancing $Q_{vent}$) and by deploying portable or integrated High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filtration systems (enhancing $Q_{HEPA,eff}$).
