It is based on the standard and widely used one-compartment model of pharmacokinetics with first-order elimination. The provided equations, $C(t)=C_{0}\\,\\exp(-k\\,t)$ and $k=\\ln(2)/t_{1/2}$, are fundamental and correct definitions within this model.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe prophylactic objective requires that the drug concentration remains at or above the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) throughout the dosing interval. The lowest concentration during the interval occurs just before the next dose is administered. This is the trough concentration, which occurs at time $t=\\tau$. The problem specifies that this concentration must be at or above the $\\text{MIC}$. This condition can be written as an inequality:\n$$\nC(\\tau^{-}) \\ge \\text{MIC}\n$$\nThe problem provides the explicit expression for the trough concentration as $C(\\tau^{-})=C_{0}\\,\\exp(-k\\,\\tau)$. Substituting this into the inequality gives:\n$$\nC_{0}\\,\\exp(-k\\,\\tau) \\ge \\text{MIC}\n$$\nFor any therapeutic effect to be possible, the initial concentration $C_0$ must be greater than the $\\text{MIC}$. Assuming $C_{0} > \\text{MIC}$, we can proceed to solve for $\\tau$. We seek the largest dosing interval $\\tau$ that satisfies this condition. The function $f(\\tau) = C_{0}\\,\\exp(-k\\,\\tau)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $\\tau$ since the elimination rate constant $k$ and time $\\tau$ are positive. Therefore, the largest value of $\\tau$ that satisfies the inequality will be the value that satisfies the equality:\n$$\nC_{0}\\,\\exp(-k\\,\\tau) = \\text{MIC}\n$$\nWe now solve this equation for $\\tau$. First, isolate the exponential term:\n$$\n\\exp(-k\\,\\tau) = \\frac{\\text{MIC}}{C_{0}}\n$$\nNext, take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\exp(-k\\,\\tau)\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\text{MIC}}{C_{0}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n-k\\,\\tau = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\text{MIC}}{C_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the logarithmic property $\\ln(a/b) = -\\ln(b/a)$, we can rewrite the right side:\n$$\n-k\\,\\tau = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{\\text{MIC}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nk\\,\\tau = \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{\\text{MIC}}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $\\tau$ yields:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{1}{k} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{\\text{MIC}}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem requires the final expression to be in terms of $C_{0}$, $t_{1/2}$, and $\\text{MIC}$. We are given the relationship between the elimination rate constant $k$ and the half-life $t_{1/2}$:\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $k$ into our equation for $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\\right)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{\\text{MIC}}\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the expression gives the final closed-form result for the largest possible dosing interval $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{t_{1/2}}{\\ln(2)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{\\text{MIC}}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression represents the maximum time interval between doses that ensures the plasma drug concentration does not fall below the $\\text{MIC}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{t_{1/2}}{\\ln(2)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{\\text{MIC}}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "4509628"}, {"introduction": "Moving from individual pharmacokinetics to population-level impact, this practice addresses a central question in program planning: how much will our intervention reduce the burden of disease?

This implies that the treatment is distributed randomly with respect to the infection status. Therefore, the population of infected individuals is also treated with coverage $c$.\n\nWe can partition the initially infected population into two groups:\n1.
