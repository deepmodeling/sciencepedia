In a single homogeneous community, assume constant baseline entomological parameters over time: mosquito density relative to humans $m$, mosquito human-biting rate per mosquito per day $a$, daily survival probability of adult mosquitoes $p$ with $0p1$, and the Extrinsic Incubation Period (EIP) in days $n$. The classical vectorial capacity, defined as the potential number of infectious bites per human per day generated by the mosquito population given pathogen presence, is given by the well-tested Ross–Macdonald expression\n$$C = \\frac{m a^{2} p^{n}}{-\\ln p}.$$\nAt baseline, take $m = 5$, $a = 0.25$ bites per mosquito per day, $p = 0.9$, and $n = 12$ days.

This sensitivity is quantified using the concept of elasticity. The entire analysis is based on the Ross-Macdonald model for vectorial capacity.\n\nThe given expression for vectorial capacity is:\n$$C = \\frac{m a^{2} p^{n}}{-\\ln p}$$\nThe baseline parameters are provided as:\n- Mosquito density relative to humans: $m = 5$\n- Human-biting rate: $a = 0.25$\n- Daily survival probability: $p = 0.9$\n- Extrinsic Incubation Period (EIP): $n = 12$ days\n\nThe problem asks for three quantities to be computed, followed by an interpretation:\n1. The baseline vectorial capacity, $C$.\n2. The elasticities of $C$ with respect to $p$ and $a$, denoted $E_p$ and $E_a$, respectively.\n3. The ratio $R = \\frac{E_p}{E_a}$.\n\nWe will address each part in sequence.\n\nFirst, we calculate the baseline vectorial capacity, $C$, by substituting the given parameter values into the expression for $C$.\n$$C = \\frac{(5) (0.25)^{2} (0.9)^{12}}{-\\ln(0.9)}$$\nWe compute the numerical values for the components:\n- $(0.25)^2 = 0.0625$\n- $(0.9)^{12} \\approx 0.2824295$\n- $\\ln(0.9) \\approx -0.1053605$\nSubstituting these values:\n$$C \\approx \\frac{5 \\times 0.0625 \\times 0.2824295}{-(-0.1053605)} \\approx \\frac{0.0882592}{0.1053605} \\approx 0.8377$$\nThus, the baseline vectorial capacity is approximately $0.8377$ potential infectious bites per human per day.\n\nSecond, we compute the elasticities $E_a$ and $E_p$. The definition of elasticity provided is $E_{x} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln C}{\\partial \\ln x}$. To use this definition, we first derive an expression for $\\ln C$.\n$$\n\\ln C = \\ln\\left(\\frac{m a^{2} p^{n}}{-\\ln p}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this expands to:\n$$\n\\ln C = \\ln(m) + \\ln(a^2) + \\ln(p^n) - \\ln(-\\ln p)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln C = \\ln(m) + 2\\ln(a) + n\\ln(p) - \\ln(-\\ln p)\n$$\nNow we can compute the partial derivatives with respect to $\\ln a$ and $\\ln p$.\n\nTo find the elasticity with respect to $a$, $E_a$:\n$$E_{a} = \\frac{\\partial (\\ln C)}{\\partial (\\ln a)} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln a} [\\ln(m) + 2\\ln(a) + n\\ln(p) - \\ln(-\\ln p)]$$\nTreating $\\ln(m)$, $\\ln(p)$, and $n$ as constants with respect to $\\ln a$:\n$$E_{a} = 0 + 2 \\frac{\\partial(\\ln a)}{\\partial(\\ln a)} + 0 - 0 = 2$$\nThe elasticity of $C$ with respect to $a$ is exactly $2$. This is independent of the baseline parameter values and arises directly from the fact that $C$ is proportional to $a^2$.\n\nTo find the elasticity with respect to $p$, $E_p$:\n$$E_{p} = \\frac{\\partial (\\ln C)}{\\partial (\\ln p)} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln p} [\\ln(m) + 2\\ln(a) + n\\ln(p) - \\ln(-\\ln p)]$$\nTreating $\\ln(m)$ and $\\ln(a)$ as constants with respect to $\\ln p$:\n$$E_{p} = 0 + 0 + n \\frac{\\partial(\\ln p)}{\\partial(\\ln p)} - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln p} [\\ln(-\\ln p)]$$\nThe first derivative term is simply $n$. For the second term, we use the chain rule. Let $u = \\ln p$. The derivative is $\\frac{d}{du}[\\ln(-u)] = \\frac{1}{-u} \\cdot (-1) = \\frac{1}{u}$. Substituting back $u = \\ln p$, we get $\\frac{1}{\\ln p}$.\nTherefore, the expression for $E_p$ is:\n$$E_{p} = n - \\frac{1}{\\ln p}$$\nThis elasticity depends on the parameters $n$ and $p$. We evaluate it at the baseline values $n=12$ and $p=0.9$:\n$$E_{p} = 12 - \\frac{1}{\\ln(0.9)} \\approx 12 - \\frac{1}{-0.1053605} = 12 + 9.49122 \\approx 21.49122$$\n\nThird, we compute the ratio $R = \\frac{E_{p}}{E_{a}}$.\n$$R = \\frac{n - \\frac{1}{\\ln p}}{2}$$\nUsing the values computed at baseline:\n$$R \\approx \\frac{21.49122}{2} \\approx 10.74561$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures as requested, we get $R = 10.75$.\n\nFinally, we interpret this result. The elasticity $E_x$ of a function $C$ with respect to a parameter $x$ represents the percentage change in $C$ resulting from a $1\\%$ change in $x$. We found $E_a = 2$ and $E_p \\approx 21.5$. The ratio $R = E_p / E_a \\approx 10.75$. This signifies that vectorial capacity $C$ is approximately $10.75$ times more sensitive to a proportional change in mosquito daily survival probability ($p$) than it is to a proportional change in the human-biting rate ($a$), near the given baseline conditions. For instance, a $1\\%$ reduction in $p$ would lead to approximately a $21.5\\%$ reduction in $C$, whereas a $1\\%$ reduction in $a$ would lead to only a $2\\%$ reduction in $C$. This demonstrates that interventions targeting mosquito survival (e.g., insecticides, which reduce $p$) are substantially more potent for controlling malaria transmission than interventions that target biting frequency (e.g., repellents, which reduce $a$), a foundational principle in vector control strategy. The strong dependence on $p$ arises from its dual role in the model: it affects the mosquito's lifespan ($1/(-\\ln p)$) and its ability to survive the EIP ($p^n$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10.75}$$", "id": "4559183"}, {"introduction": "Effective disease prevention requires knowing where and when people are at risk.

Let the fundamental base be the following widely accepted principles: (i) at any time, the per-mosquito biting hazard in a setting is proportional to human host availability in that setting, scaled by any intrinsic setting preference of the vector; (ii) probabilities are obtained by normalizing nonnegative hazards so they sum to one across mutually exclusive settings; and (iii) the overall probability across a day or night is the time-average of conditional probabilities weighted by the vector’s host-seeking activity distribution, which is a statement of the law of total probability.\n\nConsider a single night partitioned into three empirically observed intervals with the following characteristics.\n- The species’ intrinsic indoor preference is represented by an endophagy coefficient $k$, defined such that, holding host availability equal, the instantaneous indoor biting hazard is $k$ times the outdoor hazard. For this species, $k = 2.5$.\n- The human indoor availability fractions are $p_{1} = 0.55$ during $18$–$22$ hours, $p_{2} = 0.95$ during $22$–$05$ hours, and $p_{3} = 0.70$ during $05$–$07$ hours. Outdoor availability in each interval is the complement, $1 - p_{i}$.\n- The vector host-seeking activity distribution across these intervals is given by weights $a_{1} = 0.25$, $a_{2} = 0.60$, and $a_{3} = 0.15$, which sum to $1$.\n\nUsing only the principles stated above, derive from first principles an expression for the expected fraction of all bites that occur indoors over the night and evaluate it for the given data. Then, briefly justify how the magnitude of this fraction determines the potential relative utility of Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) versus spatial repellents, given that LLINs primarily block indoor bites when people are in bed and spatial repellents can be deployed to reduce outdoor bites.

It provides a set of principles and all necessary parameters to derive a unique, meaningful solution based on established concepts in vector biology and epidemiology. The problem is valid.\n\nThe central task is to derive and calculate the expected fraction of all mosquito bites that occur indoors over a single night, which has been partitioned into three distinct time intervals. This quantity is equivalent to the overall probability that a random bite occurs indoors, $P(I)$.\n\nLet $I$ be the event of a bite occurring indoors and $O$ be the event of a bite occurring outdoors. Let $T_i$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ denote the event that a mosquito is host-seeking during time interval $i$. The problem specifies the probabilities of these timing events as weights $a_i = P(T_i)$, with $a_1=0.25$, $a_2=0.60$, and $a_3=0.15$.\n\nAccording to Principle (iii), which is a statement of the law of total probability, the overall probability of an indoor bite $P(I)$ is the weighted average of the conditional probabilities of biting indoors during each time interval, where the weights are the proportions of vector host-seeking activity in those intervals.\n$$P(I) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} P(I | T_i) P(T_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} a_i P(I | T_i)$$\n\nNext, we must derive an expression for the conditional probability, $P(I|T_i)$, for each interval $i$. This is the probability of a bite being indoors, given that the mosquito is active in interval $i$.\n\nPrinciple (i) states that the biting hazard in a setting is proportional to the human host availability in that setting, scaled by an intrinsic setting preference factor. Let $H_{I,i}$ and $H_{O,i}$ be the indoor and outdoor biting hazards in interval $i$, respectively. Let $p_i$ be the fraction of the human population that is indoors during interval $i$. The fraction outdoors is therefore $1-p_i$. The intrinsic indoor preference is given by the endophagy coefficient, $k$. We can set the outdoor preference factor to $1$ without loss of generality. Thus, the hazards are:\n$$H_{I,i} \\propto k \\cdot p_i$$\n$$H_{O,i} \\propto 1 \\cdot (1 - p_i)$$\nLet $\\lambda_i$ be the constant of proportionality for interval $i$, which encapsulates factors like total vector density and activity level during that specific interval.\n$$H_{I,i} = \\lambda_i k p_i$$\n$$H_{O,i} = \\lambda_i (1 - p_i)$$\n\nPrinciple (ii) states that probabilities are found by normalizing these non-negative hazards. Since biting indoors and outdoors are mutually exclusive events, the probability of an indoor bite, given activity in interval $i$, is the indoor hazard divided by the total hazard in that interval.\n$$P(I | T_i) = \\frac{H_{I,i}}{H_{I,i} + H_{O,i}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the hazards:\n$$P(I | T_i) = \\frac{\\lambda_i k p_i}{\\lambda_i k p_i + \\lambda_i (1 - p_i)}$$\nThe proportionality constant $\\lambda_i$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, yielding a general expression for the conditional probability of indoor biting that depends only on human behavior ($p_i$) and vector preference ($k$).\n$$P(I | T_i) = \\frac{k p_i}{k p_i + 1 - p_i}$$\n\nSubstituting this expression back into the equation for the overall probability $P(I)$, we obtain the final formula derived from the given first principles:\n$$P(I) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} a_i \\left( \\frac{k p_i}{k p_i + 1 - p_i} \\right)$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided data:\n- Endophagy coefficient: $k = 2.5$\n- Interval 1: $a_1 = 0.25$, $p_1 = 0.55$\n- Interval 2: $a_2 = 0.60$, $p_2 = 0.95$\n- Interval 3: $a_3 = 0.15$, $p_3 = 0.70$\n\nWe calculate the term for each interval:\nFor interval 1 ($18$–$22$ hours):\n$$P(I | T_1) = \\frac{2.5 \\times 0.55}{2.5 \\times 0.55 + (1 - 0.55)} = \\frac{1.375}{1.375 + 0.45} = \\frac{1.375}{1.825}$$\nFor interval 2 ($22$–$05$ hours):\n$$P(I | T_2) = \\frac{2.5 \\times 0.95}{2.5 \\times 0.95 + (1 - 0.95)} = \\frac{2.375}{2.375 + 0.05} = \\frac{2.375}{2.425}$$\nFor interval 3 ($05$–$07$ hours):\n$$P(I | T_3) = \\frac{2.5 \\times 0.70}{2.5 \\times 0.70 + (1 - 0.70)} = \\frac{1.75}{1.75 + 0.30} = \\frac{1.75}{2.05}$$\n\nNow, we compute the weighted sum:\n$$P(I) = (0.25) \\left( \\frac{1.375}{1.825} \\right) + (0.60) \\left( \\frac{2.375}{2.425} \\right) + (0.15) \\left( \\frac{1.75}{2.05} \\right)$$\n$$P(I) \\approx (0.25)(0.7534246575) + (0.60)(0.9793814433) + (0.15)(0.8536585366)$$\n$$P(I) \\approx 0.1883561644 + 0.5876288660 + 0.1280487805$$\n$$P(I) \\approx 0.9040338109$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the expected fraction of all bites that occur indoors is $0.9040$.\n\nJustification of intervention utility:\nThe calculated fraction of indoor bites, $P(I) \\approx 0.9040$, is a critical metric for prioritizing public health interventions. Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) are effective primarily by preventing bites when people are indoors and in bed. Spatial repellents are interventions that can reduce biting in a given area, such as a porch or campsite, and are thus particularly useful for preventing outdoor bites.\nA high value of $P(I)$, as found here, signifies that the vast majority ($90\\%$) of human-vector contact occurs indoors. This aetiology strongly indicates that interventions targeting the indoor environment, like LLINs, will have a very high potential impact on disease transmission. The problem is predominantly one of indoor biting. Conversely, if $P(I)$ were low, a large fraction of bites would occur outdoors, where LLINs offer no protection. In such a case, outdoor-focused interventions like spatial repellents would be essential to complement LLINs for comprehensive protection. Therefore, the magnitude of $P(I)$ directly informs the potential relative utility of LLINs versus spatial repellents; for this particular ecosystem, the exceptionally high indoor biting fraction confirms that LLINs are an extremely well-targeted intervention.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9040}$$", "id": "4559208"}, {"introduction": "Public health in action involves a continuous cycle of surveillance, analysis, and response.
