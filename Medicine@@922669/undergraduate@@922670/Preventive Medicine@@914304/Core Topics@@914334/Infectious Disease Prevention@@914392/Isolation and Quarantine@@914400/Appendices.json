Derivation of the Risk Score $S_{g}$**\n\nThe risk score $S_{g}$ for an individual in group $g$ is defined as the expected number of secondary infections they would generate over the remaining infectious period, $D_{\\mathrm{rem}}$, in the absence of quarantine. This can be calculated as the product of the remaining infectious duration, the daily contact rate, and the average per-contact transmission probability.\n\nFirst, we determine the average per-contact transmission probability, $p_{g}$, for an individual in group $g$. This probability depends on the baseline transmission probability $p_0$, the setting multiplier $s_g$, and the effect of mask-wearing.\n\nAn individual in group $g$ wears a mask with probability $a_g$. When a mask is worn correctly, the transmission probability is reduced by the source-control efficacy $\\eta$, resulting in a transmission probability of $p_0 s_g (1 - \\eta)$.\nAn individual in group $g$ does not wear a mask with probability $(1 - a_g)$. In this case, the transmission probability is $p_0 s_g$.\n\nThe average per-contact transmission probability $p_g$ is the weighted average of these two scenarios:\n$$p_g = a_g \\cdot [p_0 s_g (1 - \\eta)] + (1 - a_g) \\cdot [p_0 s_g]$$\nFactoring out the common term $p_0 s_g$:\n$$p_g = p_0 s_g [a_g (1 - \\eta) + (1 - a_g)]$$\n$$p_g = p_0 s_g [a_g - a_g \\eta + 1 - a_g]$$\n$$p_g = p_0 s_g (1 - a_g \\eta)$$\nThis expression represents the average probability of transmission for any single contact made by an individual from group $g$.\n\nNext, we calculate the expected number of secondary infections generated per day by an individual from group $g$. This is the product of their daily contact rate, $c_g$, and the average per-contact transmission probability, $p_g$:\n$$\\text{Infections per day} = c_g p_g = c_g p_0 s_g (1 - a_g \\eta)$$\n\nThe risk score $S_g$ is the total number of expected secondary infections over the entire remaining infectious duration, $D_{\\mathrm{rem}}$.\n$$S_g = D_{\\mathrm{rem}} \\cdot (\\text{Infections per day})$$\n$$S_g = D_{\\mathrm{rem}} c_g p_0 s_g (1 - a_g \\eta)$$\nThis is the mechanistically justified risk score.

Optimal Prioritization Rule**\n\nTo minimize the total number of secondary infections from the cohort, we must maximize the number of averted infections using the available quarantine resources for $Q=35$ individuals. The number of infections averted by quarantining one person from group $g$ is exactly their risk score, $S_g$.

Quarantine all $n_{\\mathrm{H}} = 30$ individuals from Group H. This uses $30$ slots.\n2.  Remaining slots: $35 - 30 = 5$.\n3.  Quarantine $5$ individuals from the next highest risk group, Group W.
