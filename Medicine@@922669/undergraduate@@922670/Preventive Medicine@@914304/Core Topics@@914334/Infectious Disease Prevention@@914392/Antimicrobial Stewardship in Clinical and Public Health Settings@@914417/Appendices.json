Over the prior year, the hospitalwide Days of Therapy (DOT) per $1000$ patient-days was consistently $650$. In the first full month after implementation, the stewardship team compiles ward-level counts of antibiotic exposure and census. The three largest wards report the following monthly totals: Adult Medicine: $1600$ antibiotic days and $3400$ patient-days; Surgical Intensive Care Unit (ICU): $1200$ antibiotic days and $1800$ patient-days; Pediatrics: $2400$ antibiotic days and $4800$ patient-days. For surveillance and benchmarking, epidemiology programs use DOT per $1000$ patient-days as a rate measure that normalizes antibiotic exposure by census. Using the standard epidemiologic definition of Days of Therapy (DOT) per $1000$ patient-days, compute the hospitalwide DOT for the post-intervention month by aggregating across wards, and then, relative to the baseline value of $650$, compute the fractional reduction attributable to the intervention. Round your final fractional reduction to four significant figures. Express the final answer as a decimal (no percent sign).", "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on standard epidemiological principles and metrics used in antimicrobial stewardship. The data provided are sufficient for the calculation under the reasonable interpretation that \"hospitalwide\" refers to the aggregate of the specified wards.\n\nThe primary metric is the Days of Therapy (DOT) per $1000$ patient-days, which we will denote as $R$. This rate is defined as the total number of days a patient receives at least one dose of an antibiotic (antibiotic days, $D$) divided by the total number of days patients were in the hospital (patient-days, $P$), normalized by a factor of $1000$. The formula is:\n$$R = \\left( \\frac{D}{P} \\right) \\times 1000$$\n\nThe problem provides the baseline (pre-intervention) hospitalwide rate, which we denote as $R_{pre}$:\n$$R_{pre} = 650 \\text{ DOT per 1000 patient-days}$$\n\nAfter the intervention, data are provided for three specific hospital wards:\n1. Adult Medicine: $D_{med} = 1600$ antibiotic days, $P_{med} = 3400$ patient-days.\n2. Surgical Intensive Care Unit (ICU): $D_{ICU} = 1200$ antibiotic days, $P_{ICU} = 1800$ patient-days.\n3. Pediatrics: $D_{peds} = 2400$ antibiotic days, $P_{peds} = 4800$ patient-days.\n\nTo compute the post-intervention hospitalwide DOT, we must first aggregate the data across all provided wards. The total antibiotic days, $D_{total}$, is the sum of the antibiotic days from each ward.\n$$D_{total} = D_{med} + D_{ICU} + D_{peds}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$D_{total} = 1600 + 1200 + 2400 = 5200 \\text{ antibiotic days}$$\n\nSimilarly, the total patient-days, $P_{total}$, is the sum of the patient-days from each ward.\n$$P_{total} = P_{med} + P_{ICU} + P_{peds}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P_{total} = 3400 + 1800 + 4800 = 10000 \\text{ patient-days}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the post-intervention hospitalwide DOT rate, $R_{post}$, using these aggregated totals.\n$$R_{post} = \\left( \\frac{D_{total}}{P_{total}} \\right) \\times 1000$$\n$$R_{post} = \\left( \\frac{5200}{10000} \\right) \\times 1000 = 0.52 \\times 1000 = 520 \\text{ DOT per 1000 patient-days}$$\n\nThe final step is to compute the fractional reduction, $F$, attributable to the intervention. The fractional reduction is the change in the rate divided by the original (baseline) rate.\n$$F = \\frac{\\text{Change in rate}}{\\text{Original rate}} = \\frac{R_{pre} - R_{post}}{R_{pre}}$$\nSubstituting the values for $R_{pre}$ and $R_{post}$:\n$$F = \\frac{650 - 520}{650} = \\frac{130}{650}$$\nThis fraction simplifies to:\n$$F = \\frac{13}{65} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact decimal value is $0.2$. To express this with four significant figures, we add trailing zeros.\n$$F = 0.2000$$\nThis represents the fractional reduction in antimicrobial use.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2000}$$", "id": "4503690"}, {"introduction": "Beyond tracking overall use, stewardship involves making informed decisions for individual patients, a practice known as diagnostic stewardship. A crucial element is the ability to accurately interpret diagnostic tests to avoid unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Calculation\nLet $I$ be the event that a patient has the true infection, and let $I^c$ be the complementary event that the patient does not have the infection. Let $T^+$ be the event that the test result is positive, and $T^-$ be the event that the test result is negative.\n\nThe information provided can be expressed in terms of conditional probabilities:\n- The pre-test probability of infection is the prior probability, $P(I) = 0.20$.\n- The probability of not being infected is therefore $P(I^c) = 1 - P(I) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\n- Sensitivity is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient is infected: $P(T^+ | I) = 0.95$.\n- Specificity is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient is not infected: $P(T^- | I^c) = 0.98$.\n\nFrom the definition of specificity, we can determine the probability of a positive test result given that the patient is not infected (the false positive rate). This is the complement of specificity:\n$$ P(T^+ | I^c) = 1 - P(T^- | I^c) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02 $$\n\nThe goal is to find the post-test probability of true infection given a positive test result, which is denoted as $P(I | T^+)$.\n\nWe begin with Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probability $P(I | T^+)$ to its inverse $P(T^+ | I)$:\n$$ P(I | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | I) P(I)}{P(T^+)} $$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, represents the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. This can be calculated for the entire cohort by applying the law of total probability. A positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive ways: a true positive (the patient is infected and tests positive) or a false positive (the patient is not infected but tests positive).\nThe law of total probability allows us to expand $P(T^+)$ as follows:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap I) + P(T^+ \\cap I^c) $$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can write:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ | I) P(I) + P(T^+ | I^c) P(I^c) $$\n\nNow, we substitute this expansion for $P(T^+)$ into the denominator of Bayes' theorem. This yields the full expression for the post-test probability, derived from the foundational principles as required:\n$$ P(I | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | I) P(I)}{P(T^+ | I) P(I) + P(T^+ | I^c) P(I^c)} $$\nThis expression for the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is composed entirely of the quantities defined at the outset: sensitivity, specificity (via its complement), and pre-test probability.\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values into this derived expression:\n- $P(T^+ | I) = 0.95$\n- $P(I) = 0.20$\n- $P(T^+ | I^c) = 0.02$\n- $P(I^c) = 0.80$\n\nThe numerator represents the probability of a true positive result in the population:\n$$ P(T^+ | I) P(I) = (0.95) \\times (0.20) = 0.19 $$\n\nThe denominator's second term represents the probability of a false positive result in the population:\n$$ P(T^+ | I^c) P(I^c) = (0.02) \\times (0.80) = 0.016 $$\n\nThe total probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$, is the sum of these two probabilities:\n$$ P(T^+) = 0.19 + 0.016 = 0.206 $$\n\nFinally, the post-test probability of infection is the ratio of the true positive probability to the total positive probability:\n$$ P(I | T^+) = \\frac{0.19}{0.206} $$\n$$ P(I | T^+) \\approx 0.922330097... $$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required by the problem statement, we get $0.9223$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9223}\n$$", "id": "4503656"}, {"introduction": "Once the decision to treat is made, the focus shifts to optimizing the antibiotic regimen to maximize effectiveness and minimize the risk of resistance.
