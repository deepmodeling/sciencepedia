The Basic Reproduction Number ($R_0$) for the circulating HBV strain in this population is $3$. A vaccination program is proposed using a vaccine with effectiveness $e=0.95$, where vaccine effectiveness is defined as the proportional reduction in susceptibility among vaccinated individuals relative to unvaccinated individuals.

A fraction $(1-v)$ of the population is unvaccinated.\n2.  A fraction $v$ of the population is vaccinated.\n\nThe susceptibility of an individual is their relative risk of becoming infected upon contact with an infectious person. We can normalize the susceptibility of an unvaccinated individual to $1$.\nThe problem states that the vaccine is \"leaky\" and has an effectiveness $e$, defined as the \"proportional reduction in susceptibility among vaccinated individuals\". Therefore, a vaccinated individual has their susceptibility reduced by a factor of $e$ compared to an unvaccinated individual. The susceptibility of a vaccinated person is $(1-e)$.\n\nThe effective susceptible fraction of the total population, $S$, is the average susceptibility of the entire population, weighted by the proportions of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.\n$$S = (\\text{fraction unvaccinated}) \\times (\\text{susceptibility of unvaccinated}) + (\\text{fraction vaccinated}) \\times (\\text{susceptibility of vaccinated})$$\nSubstituting the respective terms:\n$$S = (1-v) \\times 1 + v \\times (1-e)$$\nSimplifying this expression:\n$$S = 1 - v + v - ve$$\n$$S = 1 - ve$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $S$ back into the condition for disease control, $R_0 S < 1$:\n$$R_0 (1 - ve) < 1$$\n\nWe must solve this inequality for the vaccination coverage $v$. Since $R_0 = 3 > 0$, we can divide by $R_0$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$1 - ve < \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\nRearranging the terms to isolate the term containing $v$:\n$$1 - \\frac{1}{R_0} < ve$$\nCombining the terms on the left-hand side:\n$$\\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0} < ve$$\nSince both $e$ and $R_0$ are positive, we can divide by them.

Positive Predictive Value of the Two-Step Reflex Algorithm ($PPV_{\\mathrm{Ab+RNA}}$)**\n\nThe two-step algorithm gives an \"overall positive\" result if the antibody test is positive AND the reflex RNA test is positive. The positive predictive value of this algorithm, $PPV_{\\mathrm{Ab+RNA}}$, is the probability that a person has the disease given this \"overall positive\" result.

Consequently, the probability of the combined false positive event, $P(T_{\\mathrm{Ab}}+ \\cap T_{\\mathrm{RNA}}+|D^c)$, is zero.

Passive immunization with HBIG provides this immediate protection.\n        *   Since the individual has completed a vaccine series but is no longer immune (or was a non-responder), their long-term active immunity must be restored. This is achieved by administering a Hepatitis B vaccine booster, which will stimulate an anamnestic response (in prior responders with waning immunity) or attempt to elicit a response (in prior non-responders).\n        *   **Conclusion for this case**: Administer **both** HBIG and a Hepatitis B vaccine booster.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Individual IS protected (anti-HBs $\\geq 10 \\text{ mIU/mL}$)**\n        *   The individual's immune system has an adequate concentration of protective antibodies to neutralize the virus.\n        *   No immediate, passive protection (HBIG) is needed.\n        *   No booster is required, as their immune memory and current antibody level are sufficient to manage the exposure.\n        *   **Conclusion for this case**: Administer **neither** HBIG nor a Hepatitis B vaccine booster.\n\n3.  **HBIG Dose Calculation**:\n    *   If HBIG is indicated, the dose is calculated based on body weight.\n    *   Dose $(\\text{mL}) = 0.06 \\text{ mL/kg} \\times \\text{Weight} (\\text{kg})$.\n\n### Application of the Derived Algorithm to the Recipients\n\n**Recipient $R_1$**:\n*   Given: anti-HBs $= 8 \\text{ mIU/mL}$, weight $= 60 \\text{ kg}$.\n*   Immune Status: The anti-HBs level of $8 \\text{ mIU/mL}$ is less than the seroprotective threshold of $10 \\text{ mIU/mL}$.
