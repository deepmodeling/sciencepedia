This is achieved through 'herd immunity,' where a sufficient proportion of the population is immune, thereby protecting even the unvaccinated. This practice challenges you to perform the foundational calculation that determines the herd immunity threshold, connecting a disease's intrinsic transmissibility ($R_0$) and a vaccine's effectiveness (VE) to the minimum coverage needed to protect the community. Mastering this concept is the first step in understanding the scientific rationale behind vaccination targets [@problem_id:4551585].", "problem": "A national immunization schedule aims to interrupt measles transmission using a single-dose measles-containing vaccine. Assume a closed, homogeneously mixing population with no waning immunity during the time horizon considered, and ignore births and deaths. The Basic Reproduction Number ($R_0$) for measles is $15$. Vaccine Efficacy (VE) against infection for the administered dose is $0.93$. The Effective Reproduction Number ($R_e$) is defined as the expected number of secondary infections produced by a typical infectious individual in the population under current levels of immunity and control measures. In a homogeneously mixing population, vaccination confers protection to a fraction of the population equal to the product of coverage and vaccine efficacy, thereby reducing the susceptible fraction accordingly.\n\nUsing these definitions and assumptions, determine the minimum vaccination coverage, denoted $p$, required such that $R_e1$.

The concepts of $R_0$, $R_e$, vaccine efficacy, and herd immunity are fundamental to infectious disease modeling. The given value of $R_0=15$ for measles is a commonly cited estimate in scientific literature, reflecting its high transmissibility. The vaccine efficacy of $VE=0.93$ is also a realistic value for a single dose of the measles vaccine.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all the necessary parameters ($R_0$, $VE$) and a clear objective ($R_e  1$) to calculate a unique value for the minimum coverage $p$. The relationship between $R_e$, $R_0$, and the susceptible population fraction is implicitly standard and also described.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. The solution process may proceed.\n\nThe Effective Reproduction Number, $R_e$, is related to the Basic Reproduction Number, $R_0$, and the fraction of the population that is susceptible, $s$, by the equation:\n$$R_e = R_0 \\cdot s$$\nTo interrupt transmission of the disease, the number of secondary infections produced by a single infectious individual must be, on average, less than one. This corresponds to the condition:\n$$R_e  1$$\nSubstituting the expression for $R_e$, we get:\n$$R_0 \\cdot s  1$$\nThis inequality can be rearranged to find the maximum fraction of the population that can be susceptible for transmission to be halted:\n$$s  \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\nThis threshold, $s_c = 1/R_0$, is known as the critical susceptible fraction. The proportion of the population that must be immune to achieve this is the herd immunity threshold, $H_c$:\n$$H_c = 1 - s_c = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\nIn this problem, immunity is conferred by vaccination. A vaccination campaign with coverage $p$ administers the vaccine to a fraction $p$ of the population. The vaccine has an efficacy of $VE$. Therefore, the fraction of the total population that becomes effectively immune as a result of the vaccination program is the product of the coverage and the efficacy, $p \\times VE$.\n\nTo achieve herd immunity, the fraction of the population rendered immune by vaccination must be at least equal to the herd immunity threshold:\n$$p \\times VE \\ge H_c$$\nSubstituting the expression for $H_c$:\n$$p \\times VE \\ge 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\nTo find the minimum required coverage $p$, we solve the equality at the critical point:\n$$p \\cdot VE = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\nSolving for $p$:\n$$p = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}}{VE}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $R_0 = 15$ and $VE = 0.93$.\n$$p = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{15}}{0.93}$$\nFirst, we evaluate the term in the numerator:\n$$1 - \\frac{1}{15} = \\frac{15}{15} - \\frac{1}{15} = \\frac{14}{15}$$\nNow, we substitute this back into the equation for $p$:\n$$p = \\frac{\\frac{14}{15}}{0.93} = \\frac{14}{15 \\times 0.93}$$\nWe calculate the product in the denominator:\n$$15 \\times 0.93 = 13.95$$\nThis gives:\n$$p = \\frac{14}{13.95}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$p \\approx 1.003584229...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $0$, $0$, and $3$. The fifth significant digit is $5$, which requires rounding up the fourth digit.\n$$p \\approx 1.004$$\nThis result indicates that a minimum vaccination coverage of approximately $100.4\\%$ would be required. Since coverage cannot exceed $100\\%$ (or a fraction of $1$), this mathematically demonstrates that with a vaccine efficacy of $93\\%$, it is not possible to interrupt measles transmission (achieve $R_e  1$) in this idealized population, even with universal vaccination.

A Heplisav-B-only series consists of $2$ doses with a minimum interval of $4$ weeks (that is, $\\geq 28$ days) between them.\n2. If any dose in the series is a non-Heplisav-B product (for example, Engerix-B or Recombivax HB), or if the series mixes Heplisav-B with another Hepatitis B product, then a $3$-dose series is required.

The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing all necessary rules and data for a unique, logical solution. The scenario is realistic and does not violate any scientific or mathematical principles. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or missing information. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution follows.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by applying the provided rules to the vaccination history.\n\nThe patient's age of `$28$` years is $\\geq 18$ years, so the use of Heplisav-B is appropriate. Because the administered doses include both Heplisav-B and Engerix-B, the series is considered a mixed-product series. According to Rule `$2$`, a `$3$`-dose schedule is required. The validity of each administered dose must be assessed against the `$3$`-dose interval requirements.\n\n1.  **Evaluation of Dose `$1$`:**\n    The first dose of a series, administered on date $D_1 = 2024-01-15$, is always considered valid.\n    - **Valid Dose `$1$`:** Administered on $D_1 = 2024-01-15$.\n\n2.  **Evaluation of Dose `$2$`:**\n    The second dose was administered on $D_2 = 2024-02-05$. For a `$3$`-dose series, the minimum interval between Dose `$1$` and Dose `$2$` is `$28$` days (Rule `$2$`). The `$4$`-day grace period (Rule `$3$`) means the dose is valid if the interval is at least $28 - 4 = 24$ days.\n    The interval between $D_1$ and $D_2$ is calculated:\n    - Days remaining in January after $D_1$: January has `$31$` days, so $31 - 15 = 16$ days.\n    - Days in February until $D_2$: `$5$` days.\n    - Total interval: $16 + 5 = 21$ days.\n    Since the actual interval of `$21$` days is less than the minimum allowed interval with the grace period ($`24$` days), the dose administered on `$2024$-$02$-$05$` is **invalid** and does not count toward the completion of the series.\n\n3.  **Re-evaluation of the Series:**\n    Since the dose on `$2024$-$02$-$05$` is invalid, the dose administered on `$2024$-$03$-$20$` must be evaluated as a potential **second valid dose**. Let's denote its date as $D_{2,new} = 2024-03-20$. The interval is measured from the last valid dose, which is Dose `$1$` on $D_1 = 2024-01-15$.\n    The minimum interval between valid Dose `$1$` and valid Dose `$2$` is `$28$` days.\n    The interval between $D_1$ and $D_{2,new}$ is calculated:\n    - Days remaining in January: $31 - 15 = 16$ days.\n    - Days in February (`$2024$` is a leap year): `$29$` days.\n    - Days in March until $D_{2,new}$: `$20$` days.\n    - Total interval: $16 + 29 + 20 = 65$ days.\n    Since `$65 \\geq 28$`, the dose administered on `$2024$-$03$-$20$` is a **valid second dose**.\n\nThe current valid series consists of:\n- **Valid Dose `$1$`:** $D_{1,valid} = 2024-01-15$.\n- **Valid Dose `$2$`:** $D_{2,valid} = 2024-03-20$.\n\n4.  **Determining the Earliest Date for Dose `$3$`:**\n    The patient needs a third valid dose, $D_{3,req}$.

Remaining: $36 - 30 = 6$ days.\n      - This places the date `$6$` days into May.\n      - Earliest date by condition (b): `$2024$-$05$-$06$`.\n\n    To satisfy both conditions, the administration date must be on or after both `$2024$-$05$-$06$` and `$2024$-$05$-$15$`. The more restrictive (later) date is `$2024$-$05$-$15$`. Thus, the earliest valid date for the third dose is `$2024$-$05$-$15$`.\n\n5.  **Conversion to Day-of-Year:**\n    The task requires expressing `$2024$-$05$-$15$` as its day-of-year in `$2024$`.\n    - Days in January: `$31$`\n    - Days in February (leap year): `$29$`\n    - Days in March: `$31$`\n    - Days in April: `$30$`\n    - Days into May: `$15$`\n    Total day-of-year = $31 + 29 + 31 + 30 + 15 = 136$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{136}$$", "id": "4551586"}, {"introduction": "While epidemiological goals and clinical rules define the ideal immunization strategy, real-world implementation is often governed by economic constraints.
