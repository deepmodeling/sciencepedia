If an intervention reaches a contact before they become infectious, and the contact adheres to quarantine, transmission from that contact is reduced by a multiplicative efficacy factor.\n- For a case of type $i$, let $c_i$ denote the expected number of close contacts, $a_i$ the baseline secondary attack rate to those contacts in the absence of intervention, $u_i$ the probability that tracing reaches a contact in time to reduce onward transmission, and $r_i$ the multiplicative reduction in transmission due to quarantine or isolation given timely tracing. Assume independence across contacts and that the expected infections prevented from a case are additive across contacts.\n\nTask 1.

This case has an expected number of $c_i$ close contacts.\nThe baseline secondary attack rate is $a_i$, which represents the probability that a close contact will be infected by the index case in the absence of any intervention.\nWithout intervention, the total expected number of secondary infections from this single index case is the product of the number of contacts and the attack rate: $E_{\\text{baseline}} = c_i a_i$.\n\nWhen contact tracing is performed for this case, we attempt to reach its $c_i$ contacts.\nFor any single contact, there are two outcomes regarding the tracing effort:\n1.  The contact is reached in time to reduce onward transmission. This occurs with probability $u_i$.\n2.  The contact is not reached in time. This occurs with probability $1-u_i$.\n\nThe problem states that if a contact is reached in time, the transmission is reduced by a multiplicative factor $r_i$. This means a fraction $r_i$ of the potential transmission is prevented. The number of infections from this single contact is $a_i$. Therefore, the number of infections *prevented* for this single contact, given timely tracing, is $a_i r_i$.\n\nThe *expected* number of infections prevented *for a single contact* is the value of the prevention ($a_i r_i$) multiplied by the probability of it occurring ($u_i$):\n$$E_{\\text{prevented, per contact}} = u_i \\cdot (a_i r_i) + (1-u_i) \\cdot 0 = a_i u_i r_i$$\nSince there are $c_i$ independent contacts for a case of type $i$, and the expected values are additive, the total expected number of infections prevented per traced case of type $i$ is the sum of the expected preventions over all contacts.\nLet $v_i$ be this value.\n$$v_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{c_i} E_{\\text{prevented, per contact}} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c_i} a_i u_i r_i = c_i a_i u_i r_i$$\n\n**Optimization Problem Formulation**\n\nThe goal is to maximize the total expected infections prevented, subject to constraints on tracer time and the number of available cases.\n\n**Decision Variables:**\nLet $x_i$ be the number of cases of type $i$ that are traced, where $i \\in \\{A, B, C\\}$.

Set $x_B = 0, x_C = 1$.\n  - Time used: $1 \\times 0.75 = 0.75$ hours. This fits the budget.\n  - Value added: $1 \\times v_C = 0.192$.\n- Option 3: Choose zero cases. $x_B=0, x_C=0$. Value added is $0$.\n\nComparing the options, choosing one case of type $B$ provides the highest additional value ($0.20 > 0.192$). Thus, we set $x_B = 1$ and $x_C = 0$.\n\n**Final Allocation:**\nThe resulting allocation is $x_A = 32$, $x_B = 1$, $x_C = 0$.\n- Total time used: $(32 \\times 2) + (1 \\times 1) + (0 \\times 0.75) = 64 + 1 + 0 = 65$ hours.\n- Total expected infections prevented: $(32 \\times 0.96) + (1 \\times 0.20) + (0 \\times 0.192) = 30.72 + 0.20 = 30.92$.\n\nThis greedy-with-correction approach is robust for this problem structure. Any alternative allocation, such as tracing fewer type $A$ cases to free up time for more of types $B$ and $C$, would result in a lower total value because type $A$ is significantly more efficient per hour. For instance, swapping one case of type $A$ (cost $2$ hours, value $0.96$) for two cases of type $B$ (cost $2$ hours, value $2 \\times 0.20 = 0.40$) results in a net loss of value.\n\nThe optimal integer allocation is $(x_A, x_B, x_C) = (32, 1, 0)$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 32  1  0 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4515596"}]}
