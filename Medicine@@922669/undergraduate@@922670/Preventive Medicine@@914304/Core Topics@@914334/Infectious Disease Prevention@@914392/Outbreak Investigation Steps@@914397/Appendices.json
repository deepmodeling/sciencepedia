This process, known as case ascertainment, often relies on diagnostic tests which are never perfect. This exercise explores the core metrics of test performance, sensitivity and specificity, and demonstrates how they combine with disease prevalence to determine the practical utility of a test, quantified by its Positive and Negative Predictive Values ($PPV$ and $NPV$). Mastering this calculation is essential for correctly interpreting test results in the field and understanding the potential for misclassification [@problem_id:4554723].", "problem": "A regional health department is conducting an outbreak investigation among a defined cohort of high-risk contacts. A rapid diagnostic test is available with sensitivity $0.85$ and specificity $0.98$. At the time of screening, the true disease prevalence in this cohort is estimated to be $0.10$. Using only the fundamental definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence as probabilities, together with the rules of conditional probability, do the following: derive expressions for the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and the Negative Predictive Value (NPV); compute their numerical values; then define the total misclassification proportion $M$ as the sum of the probabilities of false positives and false negatives in the screened population, derive a general expression for $M$, and compute its numerical value for the given parameters. Finally, provide a brief interpretation of which type of misclassification (false positive or false negative) is expected to be more common in this scenario and why, using the computed probabilities. For grading, report only the value of $M$ as a decimal. Round your final answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of several diagnostic test metrics, including Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), and a total misclassification proportion ($M$). We begin by formally defining the events and probabilities based on the provided information.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that an individual from the cohort has the disease, and let $D^c$ be the complementary event that the individual does not have the disease. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result, and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe givens can be expressed in probabilistic terms:\n- The prevalence of the disease is $P(D) = 0.10$.\n- The probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\n- The sensitivity of the test, the probability of testing positive given the disease is present, is $S_n = P(T^+ | D) = 0.85$.\n- The specificity of the test, the probability of testing negative given the disease is absent, is $S_p = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.98$.\n\nFrom these definitions, we can derive the probabilities of test errors conditional on disease status:\n- The false negative rate is the probability of testing negative given the disease is present: $P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - S_n = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$.\n- The false positive rate is the probability of testing positive given the disease is absent: $P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - S_p = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expressions for PPV and NPV.\nThe Positive Predictive Value, $PPV$, is the probability that an individual with a positive test result actually has the disease, defined as $P(D | T^+)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test, which can be found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the standard parameters, we get the general expression for PPV:\n$$PPV = \\frac{S_n P(D)}{S_n P(D) + (1 - S_p)(1 - P(D))}$$\nNumerically, we first calculate $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = (0.85)(0.10) + (0.02)(0.90) = 0.085 + 0.018 = 0.103$$\nThen, the numerical value for PPV is:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.085}{0.103} \\approx 0.8252$$\n\nThe Negative Predictive Value, $NPV$, is the probability that an individual with a negative test result is truly disease-free, defined as $P(D^c | T^-)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$NPV = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test. By the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- | D) P(D) + P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the standard parameters, we get the general expression for NPV:\n$$NPV = \\frac{S_p (1 - P(D))}{(1 - S_n)P(D) + S_p(1 - P(D))}$$\nNumerically, we first calculate $P(T^-)$:\n$$P(T^-) = (0.15)(0.10) + (0.98)(0.90) = 0.015 + 0.882 = 0.897$$\nThen, the numerical value for NPV is:\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.882}{0.897} \\approx 0.9833$$\n\nNext, we address the total misclassification proportion, $M$. The problem defines $M$ as the sum of the probabilities of false positives and false negatives in the screened population.\nA false positive corresponds to the joint event of not having the disease and testing positive, i.e., $D^c \\cap T^+$.\nA false negative corresponds to the joint event of having the disease and testing negative, i.e., $D \\cap T^-$.\nThe total misclassification proportion $M$ is the probability of the union of these two mutually exclusive events:\n$$M = P((D^c \\cap T^+) \\cup (D \\cap T^-)) = P(D^c \\cap T^+) + P(D \\cap T^-)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, we can write the joint probabilities as:\n$$P(D^c \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c) = (1 - S_p)(1 - P(D))$$\n$$P(D \\cap T^-) = P(T^- | D) P(D) = (1 - S_n)P(D)$$\nThus, the general expression for $M$ in terms of prevalence ($P$), sensitivity ($S_n$), and specificity ($S_p$) is:\n$$M = (1 - S_p)(1 - P) + (1 - S_n)P$$\nThis represents the fraction of the total population that is misclassified by the test.\nWe now compute the numerical value of $M$ using the given data:\n$$M = (1 - 0.98)(1 - 0.10) + (1 - 0.85)(0.10)$$\n$$M = (0.02)(0.90) + (0.15)(0.10)$$\n$$M = 0.018 + 0.015$$\n$$M = 0.033$$\n\nFinally, we interpret which type of misclassification is more common. We compare the magnitudes of the two components of $M$:\nThe probability of a false positive in the population, $P(\\text{FP}) = P(D^c \\cap T^+) = 0.018$.\nThe probability of a false negative in the population, $P(\\text{FN}) = P(D \\cap T^-) = 0.015$.\nSince $0.018 > 0.015$, false positives are slightly more common than false negatives in this scenario. The reason is that the probability of a false positive event is the product of the conditional false positive rate ($1-S_p=0.02$) and the proportion of non-diseased people ($1-P=0.90$). The probability of a false negative event is the product of the conditional false negative rate ($1-S_n=0.15$) and the proportion of diseased people ($P=0.10$). Although the test's error rate for diseased individuals ($0.15$) is much higher than for disease-free individuals ($0.02$), the disease-free population is much larger ($90\\%$ vs $10\\%$). The large size of the non-diseased group results in a slightly larger total number of misclassifications (false positives) compared to the smaller diseased group, despite the latter group having a higher per-person error rate.\n\nThe question requires reporting the value of $M$ rounded to four significant figures.\n$M = 0.033$. To express this with four significant figures, we add trailing zeros: $0.03300$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.03300}\n$$", "id": "4554723"}, {"introduction": "After establishing a case definition, epidemiologists turn to descriptive epidemiology, analyzing the outbreak by time, place, and person. A critical tool in this step is the epidemic curve, a histogram of case onsets over time. This practice problem illustrates how to work backward from the epidemic curve's peak and a pathogen's known incubation period to estimate the probable time frame of a point-source exposure. This fundamental skill is crucial for developing hypotheses about the outbreak's source and guiding the subsequent investigation [@problem_id:4554751].", "problem": "A team of field epidemiologists has verified the diagnosis of a gastrointestinal illness cluster and constructed an epidemic curve. The curve shows a single, sharp peak, consistent with a point-source exposure. The pathogen has a known incubation period range of $2$ to $7$ days. Using only core definitions from outbreak investigation, namely that the incubation period is the time from exposure to symptom onset and that, for point-source outbreaks, the observed onset times reflect the incubation period distribution shifted by the exposure time, derive the probable exposure date interval relative to the modal onset date. Let the modal onset date be denoted by $M$ (in days on a calendar timeline). Express your final answer as the two interval endpoints in days relative to $M$, using signed offsets where negative values indicate days before $M$. Provide the endpoints as a single row matrix and do not include any units in your final boxed answer. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the probable exposure date interval based on the modal onset date and the known range of the pathogen's incubation period. Let us define the relevant variables and relationships formally.\n\nLet $T_{exp}$ be the date of exposure. Since this is a point-source outbreak, we assume all cases were exposed at this single time.\nLet $T_{onset}$ be the date of symptom onset for a given case.\nLet $T_{inc}$ be the incubation period for a given case, defined as the time elapsed from exposure to symptom onset.\nThe fundamental relationship connecting these variables is:\n$$T_{onset} = T_{exp} + T_{inc}$$\nThe problem states that the incubation period has a known range from a minimum of $2$ days to a maximum of $7$ days. We can express this as an inequality:\n$$2 \\le T_{inc} \\le 7$$\nwhere all quantities are measured in days. Let's denote the minimum incubation period as $T_{inc, min} = 2$ and the maximum as $T_{inc, max} = 7$.\n$$T_{inc, min} \\le T_{inc} \\le T_{inc, max}$$\nSince all cases originate from the single exposure event at $T_{exp}$, the spectrum of observed onset dates, $T_{onset}$, is determined by the range of incubation periods. Specifically, any observed onset date must fall within the interval defined by:\n$$T_{exp} + T_{inc, min} \\le T_{onset} \\le T_{exp} + T_{inc, max}$$\nThe problem provides the modal onset date, denoted by $M$. The modal date is the date with the highest frequency of case onsets. As an observed date within the outbreak, $M$ must itself be a possible value for $T_{onset}$. Therefore, $M$ must satisfy the inequality above:\n$$T_{exp} + T_{inc, min} \\le M \\le T_{exp} + T_{inc, max}$$\nOur objective is to find the possible range for the exposure date, $T_{exp}$. We can achieve this by isolating $T_{exp}$ in the compound inequality. We analyze the two parts of the inequality separately.\n\nFirst, consider the left-hand side of the inequality:\n$$T_{exp} + T_{inc, min} \\le M$$\nSubtracting $T_{inc, min}$ from both sides gives an upper bound for $T_{exp}$:\n$$T_{exp} \\le M - T_{inc, min}$$\nNext, consider the right-hand side of the inequality:\n$$M \\le T_{exp} + T_{inc, max}$$\nSubtracting $T_{inc, max}$ from both sides gives a lower bound for $T_{exp}$:\n$$M - T_{inc, max} \\le T_{exp}$$\nCombining these two results, we establish the probable interval for the exposure date $T_{exp}$:\n$$M - T_{inc, max} \\le T_{exp} \\le M - T_{inc, min}$$\nThis interval represents all possible dates for the single exposure event that are consistent with the modal onset date being $M$ and the incubation period being within its known range.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values for the incubation period range, $T_{inc, min} = 2$ and $T_{inc, max} = 7$:\n$$M - 7 \\le T_{exp} \\le M - 2$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be expressed as an interval relative to the modal date $M$, using signed offsets. The lower endpoint of the interval for $T_{exp}$ is $M - 7$, which corresponds to an offset of $-7$ days from $M$. The upper endpoint is $M - 2$, corresponding to an offset of $-2$ days from $M$.\n\nThe two interval endpoints, as offsets relative to $M$, are $-7$ and $-2$.

However, the observed association between an exposure and a disease can be misleading due to other factors. This exercise provides critical practice in identifying and managing two such factors: confounding, which distorts the true association, and effect modification, where the association's strength varies across different subgroups. By calculating crude, adjusted, and stratum-specific measures of association, you will learn to distinguish these two distinct phenomena and arrive at a more valid conclusion about the exposure's role in the outbreak [@problem_id:4554767].", "problem": "An acute gastroenteritis outbreak occurred among attendees at a weekend retreat. As part of the analytic step of the outbreak investigation, you are evaluating whether consumption of a cold chicken wrap (exposure) is associated with illness (outcome), and whether the crude association is distorted by a setting-related factor. You also want to assess whether biological susceptibility modifies the association.\n\nUse only core definitions of risk (attack risk equals cases divided by persons at risk), association measures as ratios of risks, and principled stratification logic to guide your derivations. Do not assume any shortcut formulas that are not derived from these bases.\n\nThe retreat served food in two dining areas that differed in background contamination risk: Dining Area L (lower background risk) and Dining Area H (higher background risk). Because attendees chose where to eat and whether to consume the wrap, the distribution of exposure differed across dining areas. The counts are:\n\n- Dining Area L:\n  - Exposed: $800$ attendees with $160$ illnesses.\n  - Unexposed: $200$ attendees with $20$ illnesses.\n- Dining Area H:\n  - Exposed: $200$ attendees with $160$ illnesses.\n  - Unexposed: $800$ attendees with $320$ illnesses.\n\nTasks grounded in first principles:\n1) Starting from the definition of attack risk as cases per persons at risk and the definition of the risk ratio as the ratio of risks, compute the crude risk ratio comparing exposed to unexposed, pooling across dining areas without adjustment. Then, compute the stratum-specific risk ratios within Dining Area L and Dining Area H, and determine whether they are approximately equal.\n2) Using stratification by dining area as a control for confounding, derive a single adjusted common risk ratio that respects the stratum structure and does not use disease-risk–dependent weights.

All calculations will be derived from the first principles of risk and risk ratio.\n\n**Task 1: Crude and Stratum-Specific Risk Ratios**\n\nFirst, we aggregate the data across both dining areas to compute the crude measures.\n- Total exposed attendees: $N_{E+} = 800 (\\text{in L}) + 200 (\\text{in H}) = 1000$.\n- Total ill among exposed: $A_{E+} = 160 (\\text{in L}) + 160 (\\text{in H}) = 320$.\n- Total unexposed attendees: $N_{E-} = 200 (\\text{in L}) + 800 (\\text{in H}) = 1000$.\n- Total ill among unexposed: $A_{E-} = 20 (\\text{in L}) + 320 (\\text{in H}) = 340$.\n\nThe crude attack risk for the exposed group, $R_{E+}$, is:\n$$R_{E+} = \\frac{A_{E+}}{N_{E+}} = \\frac{320}{1000} = 0.32$$\nThe crude attack risk for the unexposed group, $R_{E-}$, is:\n$$R_{E-} = \\frac{A_{E-}}{N_{E-}} = \\frac{340}{1000} = 0.34$$\nThe crude risk ratio, $RR_{\\text{crude}}$, is the ratio of these risks:\n$$RR_{\\text{crude}} = \\frac{R_{E+}}{R_{E-}} = \\frac{0.32}{0.34} = \\frac{32}{34} = \\frac{16}{17} \\approx 0.9412$$\n\nNext, we compute the stratum-specific risk ratios.\n\nFor Dining Area L (stratum $L$):\n- Risk in exposed: $R_{E+,L} = \\frac{160}{800} = 0.20$.\n- Risk in unexposed: $R_{E-,L} = \\frac{20}{200} = 0.10$.\n- Stratum-specific risk ratio for L: $RR_L = \\frac{R_{E+,L}}{R_{E-,L}} = \\frac{0.20}{0.10} = 2.0$.\n\nFor Dining Area H (stratum $H$):\n- Risk in exposed: $R_{E+,H} = \\frac{160}{200} = 0.80$.\n- Risk in unexposed: $R_{E-,H} = \\frac{320}{800} = 0.40$.\n- Stratum-specific risk ratio for H: $RR_H = \\frac{R_{E+,H}}{R_{E-,H}} = \\frac{0.80}{0.40} = 2.0$.\n\nThe stratum-specific risk ratios are identical ($RR_L = RR_H = 2.0$), indicating no effect modification by dining area. The discrepancy between the crude risk ratio ($RR_{\\text{crude}} \\approx 0.94$) and the stratum-specific risk ratios ($2.0$) signals the presence of confounding.\n\n**Task 2: Adjusted Common Risk Ratio**\n\nThe problem requires deriving an adjusted risk ratio using weights that are not dependent on disease risk. This can be achieved through standardization. We will calculate standardized risks for the exposed and unexposed groups by weighting their stratum-specific risks by the proportions of a \"standard\" population. A natural choice for the standard population is the total population of attendees.\n\n- Total attendees in stratum L: $N_L = 800 + 200 = 1000$.\n- Total attendees in stratum H: $N_H = 200 + 800 = 1000$.\n- Total population: $N = N_L + N_H = 2000$.\n- Weight for stratum L (proportion of total population in L): $W_L = \\frac{N_L}{N} = \\frac{1000}{2000} = 0.5$.\n- Weight for stratum H (proportion of total population in H): $W_H = \\frac{N_H}{N} = \\frac{1000}{2000} = 0.5$.\n\nThese weights, $W_L$ and $W_H$, depend only on the person-distribution across strata, not on disease risk.\n\nThe adjusted risk for the exposed group, $R_{E+, \\text{adj}}$, is the weighted average of the stratum-specific risks in the exposed:\n$$R_{E+, \\text{adj}} = W_L \\cdot R_{E+,L} + W_H \\cdot R_{E+,H} = (0.5 \\times 0.20) + (0.5 \\times 0.80) = 0.10 + 0.40 = 0.50$$\nThe adjusted risk for the unexposed group, $R_{E-, \\text{adj}}$, is the weighted average of the stratum-specific risks in the unexposed:\n$$R_{E-, \\text{adj}} = W_L \\cdot R_{E-,L} + W_H \\cdot R_{E-,H} = (0.5 \\times 0.10) + (0.5 \\times 0.40) = 0.05 + 0.20 = 0.25$$\nThe adjusted common risk ratio, $RR_{\\text{adj}}$, is the ratio of these standardized risks:\n$$RR_{\\text{adj}} = \\frac{R_{E+, \\text{adj}}}{R_{E-, \\text{adj}}} = \\frac{0.50}{0.25} = 2.0$$\nSince the stratum-specific risk ratios were uniform ($2.0$), any validly weighted average or standardized measure must yield this value. Our derivation confirms this from first principles.\n\n**Task 3: Quantify Confounding**\n\nConfounding is quantified as the relative change from the adjusted measure to the crude measure.\n$$ \\text{Relative Change} = \\frac{RR_{\\text{crude}} - RR_{\\text{adj}}}{RR_{\\text{adj}}} $$\nUsing the calculated values:\n$$ \\text{Relative Change} = \\frac{\\frac{16}{17} - 2.0}{2.0} = \\frac{\\frac{16}{17} - \\frac{34}{17}}{2.0} = \\frac{-\\frac{18}{17}}{2} = -\\frac{9}{17} \\approx -0.5294 $$\nThis indicates strong negative confounding, where the confounder (dining area) has reversed the direction of the association from protective (crude) to harmful (adjusted).\n\n**Task 4: Assess Effect Modification by Biologic Susceptibility**\n\nWe compute the stratum-specific risk ratios for the immunocompromised and immunocompetent strata from the separate reception data.\n\nFor the Immunocompromised stratum (stratum $IC$):\n- Risk in exposed: $R_{E+,IC} = \\frac{54}{60} = 0.90$.\n- Risk in unexposed: $R_{E-,IC} = \\frac{24}{120} = 0.20$.\n- Stratum-specific risk ratio: $RR_{IC} = \\frac{R_{E+,IC}}{R_{E-,IC}} = \\frac{0.90}{0.20} = 4.5$.\n\nFor the Immunocompetent stratum (stratum $IN$):\n- Risk in exposed: $R_{E+,IN} = \\frac{60}{300} = 0.20$.\n- Risk in unexposed: $R_{E-,IN} = \\frac{60}{600} = 0.10$.\n- Stratum-specific risk ratio: $RR_{IN} = \\frac{R_{E+,IN}}{R_{E-,IN}} = \\frac{0.20}{0.10} = 2.0$.\n\nThe stratum-specific risk ratios, $RR_{IC} = 4.5$ and $RR_{IN} = 2.0$, are substantially different. This heterogeneity of effect demonstrates the presence of effect modification by immune status. The effect of consuming the chicken wrap is more than twice as strong in the immunocompromised group compared to the immunocompetent group.\n\nThe final answer required is the adjusted common risk ratio from Task 2, rounded to four significant figures. This value is $2.0$. To express this with four significant figures, it is written as $2.000$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2.000}\n$$", "id": "4554767"}]}
