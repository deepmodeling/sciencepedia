Mastering this concept is the first step in quantifying the real-world impact of PrEP and is a cornerstone for both clinical counseling and public health modeling [@problem_id:4537756].", "problem": "A single receptive anal intercourse act without biomedical prevention has an empirically estimated per-act probability of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) acquisition of $p = 0.013$. A patient is adherent to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which in randomized controlled trials shows a biological efficacy of $E = 0.92$ against HIV acquisition on a per-exposure basis. Assume that efficacy represents a proportional reduction in per-act risk that acts multiplicatively on the baseline probability for that act, and that all other factors remain unchanged.\n\nUsing only foundational epidemiologic definitions of per-act risk, relative risk, and efficacy as proportional risk reduction, first derive the expression for the per-act probability of infection with PrEP, denoted $p_{\\text{post}}$, in terms of $p$ and $E$.

The first step, as per the established protocol, is to validate the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- The per-act probability of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) acquisition from a single receptive anal intercourse act without biomedical prevention is $p = 0.013$.\n- The biological efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is $E = 0.92$.\n- The definition of efficacy is a proportional reduction in per-act risk that acts multiplicatively on the baseline probability for that act.\n- The objective is to derive the expression for the per-act probability of infection with PrEP, denoted $p_{\\text{post}}$, in terms of $p$ and $E$, and then to compute its numerical value, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the established validation criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is grounded in fundamental epidemiologic principles. The concepts of per-act risk ($p$), efficacy ($E$), and proportional risk reduction are standard in the study of infectious disease transmission and prevention. The values provided for $p$ and $E$ are empirically realistic and consistent with data from studies on HIV transmission and PrEP effectiveness. The model of efficacy as a multiplicative reduction in risk is a cornerstone of vaccine and intervention evaluation.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary definitions and data to derive a unique solution. The question is clear and unambiguous.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, scientific language, free of bias or subjective claims.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation checklist. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, realistic, and well-structured.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the post-intervention probability of infection, $p_{\\text{post}}$, based on the baseline probability, $p$, and the efficacy of the intervention, $E$.\n\nThe efficacy, $E$, is defined as the proportional reduction in risk. The absolute reduction in risk is the difference between the baseline risk and the risk with the intervention, which is $p - p_{\\text{post}}$. To find the proportional reduction, this difference is divided by the original baseline risk, $p$.\n\nTherefore, the mathematical definition of efficacy is:\n$$E = \\frac{p - p_{\\text{post}}}{p}$$\n\nThis equation defines the relationship between $p$, $p_{\\text{post}}$, and $E$. The first part of the task is to derive the expression for $p_{\\text{post}}$ in terms of $p$ and $E$. We can rearrange the equation algebraically to solve for $p_{\\text{post}}$.\n\nMultiply both sides by $p$:\n$$E \\cdot p = p - p_{\\text{post}}$$\n\nIsolate the term $p_{\\text{post}}$:\n$$p_{\\text{post}} = p - E \\cdot p$$\n\nFactor out $p$ from the right-hand side:\n$$p_{\\text{post}} = p(1 - E)$$\n\nThis is the derived expression for the per-act probability of infection with PrEP. The quantity $(1 - E)$ represents the proportion of the original risk that remains after the intervention; it is often referred to as the relative risk ($RR$) or risk ratio. The definition $E = 1 - RR$ is a standard identity in epidemiology.\n\nThe second part of the task is to compute the numerical value of $p_{\\text{post}}$ using the given values.\nThe given values are:\n- $p = 0.013$\n- $E = 0.92$\n\nSubstitute these values into the derived expression:\n$$p_{\\text{post}} = 0.013 \\times (1 - 0.92)$$\n$$p_{\\text{post}} = 0.013 \\times 0.08$$\n\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$p_{\\text{post}} = 0.00104$$\n\nThe problem requires the final result to be rounded to four significant figures. In the number $0.00104$, the leading zeros are not significant. The significant figures are $1$, $0$, and $4$. Thus, the number has three significant figures. To express it with four significant figures, we must add a trailing zero.\n\nTherefore, the value of $p_{\\text{post}}$ rounded to four significant figures is $0.001040$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.001040}$$", "id": "4537756"}, {"introduction": "Effective HIV prevention with PrEP is not just about taking a pill; it's about pharmacology and achieving protective drug concentrations where they matter most.
