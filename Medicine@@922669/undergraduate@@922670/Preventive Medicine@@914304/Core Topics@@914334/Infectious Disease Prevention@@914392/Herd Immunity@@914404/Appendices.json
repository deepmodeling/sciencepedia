The pathogen has a Basic Reproduction Number ($R_0$) of 6. A detailed genetic survey of the population reveals that a fraction, $p_{nr} = 0.050$, of the individuals possess a natural genetic resistance that makes them completely immune to the pathogen. For the remaining susceptible population, a vaccine has been developed with an efficacy, $E = 0.900$, meaning it successfully confers immunity to 90.0% of the vaccinated individuals. To prevent a widespread epidemic, the public health goal is to achieve herd immunity.\n\nCalculate the minimum proportion of the susceptible population (those without natural genetic resistance) that must be vaccinated to achieve the herd immunity threshold. Express your answer as a decimal, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Herd immunity requires that the immune fraction of the total population be at least $H = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}$. Let $p_{nr}$ be the fraction naturally immune, $E$ the vaccine efficacy, and let $q$ denote the fraction of the susceptible population (those without natural resistance) that is vaccinated. The susceptible fraction is $1 - p_{nr}$. Vaccination confers additional immunity equal to $E(1 - p_{nr})q$. Therefore, the total immune fraction is\n$$\np_{nr} + E(1 - p_{nr})q,\n$$\nand the herd immunity condition at threshold is\n$$\np_{nr} + E(1 - p_{nr})q = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}.\n$$\nSolving for $q$ gives\n$$\nq = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{R_0} - p_{nr}}{E(1 - p_{nr})}.\n$$\nSubstituting $R_0 = 6$, $p_{nr} = \\frac{1}{20}$, and $E = \\frac{9}{10}$,\n$$\nq = \\frac{\\frac{5}{6} - \\frac{1}{20}}{\\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right)\\left(\\frac{19}{20}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{47}{60}}{\\frac{171}{200}} = \\frac{47}{60}\\cdot\\frac{200}{171} = \\frac{470}{513} \\approx 0.916179\\ldots\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, the required proportion of the susceptible population to vaccinate is $0.916$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.916}$$", "id": "2275002"}, {"introduction": "After mastering the calculation of the herd immunity threshold, it is crucial to understand the conditions under which the principle is valid. Herd immunity is not a universal law for all infectious agents. This next practice [@problem_id:2275007] presents a conceptual challenge using the real-world example of tetanus, a disease for which vaccination is critical but herd immunity is ineffective. By analyzing this case, you will learn to identify the most fundamental prerequisite for herd immunity: a pathogen's reliance on person-to-person transmission.", "problem": "In a public health policy meeting for a district with a very high vaccination coverage for Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis (DTaP), a budget-conscious official questions the need for continued public awareness campaigns for adult tetanus booster shots. The official's argument is based on the principle of herd immunity, which is defined as a form of indirect protection from an infectious disease that occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, whether through vaccination or previous infections, thereby reducing the likelihood of infection for individuals who lack immunity. The official posits that with vaccination rates well above 95%, the \"herd\" should protect the few individuals who are unvaccinated or whose immunity has waned.\n\nA lead epidemiologist from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is asked to respond. Which of the following statements represents the most accurate and fundamental reason why the principle of herd immunity is not applicable to the prevention of tetanus, regardless of the population's vaccination rate?\n\nA. The tetanus vaccine is a toxoid vaccine, which generates an immune response against the tetanus toxin but does not prevent the colonization of the host by the *Clostridium tetani* bacteria.\n\nB. Immunity conferred by the tetanus vaccine wanes significantly over a period of about ten years, meaning a large fraction of the adult population is susceptible at any given time, even if they were vaccinated as children.\n\nC. The causative agent of tetanus, *Clostridium tetani*, is ubiquitous in the environment (e.g., soil, dust) and is not transmitted from person to person.\n\nD. The endospores of *Clostridium tetani* are extremely resistant to heat and common antiseptics, making it impossible to eradicate the pathogen from the environment.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the principle of herd immunity for infectious diseases with human-to-human transmission. Let $R_0$ be the basic reproduction number and $S$ be the fraction of the population that is susceptible. The effective reproduction number satisfies\n$$\nR_e = R_0 \\times S.\n$$\nHerd immunity operates by reducing $S$ such that $R_e  1$, i.e., $S  \\frac{1}{R_0}$. This breaks chains of transmission between people. Therefore, herd immunity is a population-level effect that requires person-to-person transmission; otherwise, changing $S$ does not alter exposure risk, because exposures do not arise from infectious individuals.\n\nTetanus does not spread from person to person. The etiologic agent, Clostridium tetani, exists as environmentally ubiquitous spores (e.g., in soil and dust) that inoculate wounds directly from the environment. Consequently, there is no chain of transmission within the human population to interrupt. In such a setting, $R_0$ for human-to-human spread is effectively zero, and the equation $R_e = R_0 \\times S$ becomes irrelevant to risk, because the probability of exposure does not depend on the immunity status of others. Thus, herd immunity cannot protect susceptible individuals against tetanus; prevention depends on each individual’s immunity (via vaccination and boosters) at the time of injury.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A (toxoid nature of the vaccine) may be true but does not address the core reason herd immunity does not apply; herd immunity is about transmission dynamics, not colonization.\n- Option B (waning immunity) is epidemiologically important for booster policy but is not the fundamental reason herd immunity is inapplicable; even with perfect durability, herd immunity would still not operate without person-to-person spread.\n- Option C (no person-to-person transmission; environmental reservoir) directly states the fundamental reason herd immunity does not apply.\n- Option D (spore resistance) concerns eradication feasibility, not the applicability of herd immunity.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental reason is that tetanus is not transmitted from person to person and arises from environmental exposure, making herd immunity inapplicable.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2275007"}, {"introduction": "Building on the previous concepts, this final exercise explores how a pathogen's ecology can impact the effectiveness of a herd immunity strategy. The scenario [@problem_id:2275009] contrasts two pathogens with identical transmissibility in humans but with a critical difference: one has a persistent animal reservoir. This problem demonstrates the important distinction between preventing large-scale human epidemics and achieving complete disease eradication, highlighting how a zoonotic source of infection can lead to sporadic cases even in a highly vaccinated population.", "problem": "Two novel viral pathogens, Pathogen H and Pathogen Z, have emerged. Both are transmitted via respiratory droplets and cause similar clinical disease in humans. Public health officials have gathered the following epidemiological data and developed vaccines for both.\n\n- **Pathogen H**: This virus is a human-only pathogen, meaning it can only be transmitted from human to human.\n- **Pathogen Z**: This virus is a zoonotic pathogen. While it can be transmitted from human to human, it also maintains a persistent, stable reservoir in a geographically widespread population of wild rodents. Transmission from an infected rodent to a human (a spillover event) occurs at a low but constant rate.\n- **Basic Reproduction Number ($R_0$)**: For both pathogens, the basic reproduction number, defined as the average number of secondary cases produced by a single infected individual in a completely susceptible population, is estimated to be $R_0 = 5.0$ for human-to-human transmission.\n- **Vaccine Efficacy**: For both pathogens, new vaccines have been developed that provide lifelong sterilizing immunity, meaning a vaccinated individual can neither be infected nor transmit the virus.\n\nA highly successful global public health initiative results in a sustained 95% vaccination rate across the human population for both pathogens.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately contrasts the long-term epidemiological outcomes for Pathogen H and Pathogen Z under this vaccination scenario?\n\nA. Both Pathogen H and Pathogen Z will be successfully eradicated from the human population, as the 95% vaccination rate surpasses the herd immunity threshold for both.\n\nB. Large-scale epidemics of both Pathogen H and Pathogen Z will cease, but both will continue to exist as low-level endemic diseases because vaccination can never reach 100% of the population.\n\nC. Pathogen H transmission will be interrupted, leading to its potential eradication. For Pathogen Z, while human-to-human epidemics will be prevented, sporadic cases will continue to appear in humans due to ongoing transmission from the rodent reservoir.\n\nD. Pathogen Z will be easier to control than Pathogen H because the infected rodent reservoir can be targeted for elimination, which is a more effective strategy than vaccinating humans.\n\nE. The concept of herd immunity is effective for Pathogen H but is entirely irrelevant for Pathogen Z, as the presence of an animal reservoir means human vaccination has no impact on disease incidence.", "solution": "Define the following symbols:\n- $R_0$: basic reproduction number for human-to-human transmission.\n- $v$: vaccination coverage in humans.\n- $E$: vaccine efficacy against infection and transmission (sterilizing immunity implies $E=1$).\n- $R_e$: effective reproduction number for human-to-human transmission in the vaccinated population.\n\nPrinciple 1 (herd immunity threshold): The minimal coverage $p_c$ required to prevent sustained human-to-human transmission is\n$$\np_c = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}.\n$$\n\nPrinciple 2 (vaccination reduces transmission potential): With coverage $v$ and efficacy $E$, the effective reproduction number for human-to-human spread is\n$$\nR_e = R_0(1 - vE).\n$$\nFor sterilizing immunity, $E=1$, hence\n$$\nR_e = R_0(1 - v).\n$$\n\nLogical implication: If $v > p_c$, then $1 - v  \\frac{1}{R_0}$, so\n$$\nR_e = R_0(1 - v)  1,\n$$\nwhich guarantees that every human-to-human transmission chain is subcritical and dies out with probability one.\n\nApply to the given scenario: The stated vaccination coverage $v$ exceeds the herd immunity threshold $p_c$ implied by the given $R_0$, so $R_e  1$ for human-to-human transmission in both pathogens.\n\nConsequences by pathogen ecology:\n- Pathogen H (human-only): With $R_e  1$ and no nonhuman reservoir, all chains of transmission eventually terminate and no external reintroductions occur from animals. Under sustained global conditions described, transmission is interrupted and eradication becomes feasible.\n- Pathogen Z (zoonosis with a stable rodent reservoir): Let $\\lambda$ denote the (low but constant) rate of spillover infections from rodents to humans. Each spillover initiates a subcritical chain with mean size $\\frac{1}{1-R_e}$ under standard branching-process reasoning. Because $\\lambda > 0$ and persists over time, sporadic human cases will continue to appear. However, $R_e  1$ prevents large human-to-human epidemics; each spillover chain dies out. The presence of the reservoir prevents eradication from humans unless the reservoir is also controlled.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is false because the zoonotic reservoir maintains spillover, preventing eradication of Pathogen Z from humans despite $R_e  1$.\n- B is false because, for Pathogen H, $R_e  1$ with no reservoir implies elimination leading to potential eradication, not persistent endemicity; for Pathogen Z, sporadic spillovers occur but not endemic human transmission sustained by humans alone.\n- C is correct: Pathogen H is interrupted and potentially eradicated; Pathogen Z has prevented epidemics but ongoing sporadic cases from the rodent reservoir.\n- D is false: Eliminating a widespread wild rodent reservoir is not generally easier than vaccinating humans, and is not implied by the scenario.\n- E is false: Herd immunity remains highly relevant for Pathogen Z by ensuring $R_e  1$ for human-to-human spread, even though it cannot stop spillover from the reservoir.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate contrast is given by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2275009"}]}
