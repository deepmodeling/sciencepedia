This exercise provides the fundamental quantitative tools to determine the critical vaccination coverage required to halt the spread of a disease.

Assume a large, randomly mixing population without demographic turnover during the relevant time frame. The basic reproduction number ($R_0$) of measles is defined as the expected number of secondary infections caused by a single infectious individual introduced into a completely susceptible population. The effective reproduction number ($R_e$) is defined as the expected number of secondary infections in a partially immune population and must satisfy $R_e  1$ to ensure herd immunity (population-level interruption of sustained transmission). Vaccine Effectiveness ($\\mathrm{VE}$) against infection is defined as the probability that a vaccinated individual becomes immune to infection, and individuals who do not develop immunity after vaccination remain fully susceptible. If a proportion $V$ of the population receives the vaccine, the fraction susceptible after vaccination is assumed to be $1 - \\mathrm{VE}\\cdot V$ under random mixing.\n\nStarting from these definitions and conditions, derive the minimal vaccination proportion $V_{\\min}$ required for herd immunity as a function of $R_0$ and $\\mathrm{VE}$. Then, using $R_0 = 15$ and $\\mathrm{VE} = 0.95$, compute $V_{\\min}$ as a decimal. Finally, quantify sensitivity to a $5$ percentage-point absolute reduction in $\\mathrm{VE}$ (i.e., from $\\mathrm{VE} = 0.95$ to $\\mathrm{VE} = 0.90$) by computing the new minimal vaccination proportion under $\\mathrm{VE} = 0.90$.

We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe effective reproduction number, $R_e$, is defined as the product of the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, and the fraction of the population that is susceptible, $s$.\n$$R_e = R_0 \\cdot s$$\nFor herd immunity to be achieved and transmission to be interrupted, the effective reproduction number must be less than $1$.\n$$R_e  1$$\nSubstituting the first equation into this inequality gives the condition for the susceptible fraction:\n$$R_0 \\cdot s  1 \\implies s  \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\nThe problem provides a model for how the susceptible fraction $s$ depends on the vaccination proportion $V$ and the vaccine effectiveness $\\mathrm{VE}$. The proportion of the population that is vaccinated is $V$. Of this group, a fraction $\\mathrm{VE}$ becomes immune.

The fraction of the population that remains susceptible, $s$, is therefore $1$ minus the fraction that is immune due to vaccination.\n$$s = 1 - \\mathrm{VE} \\cdot V$$\nThis assumes that the entire population is initially susceptible and that immunity is conferred only through vaccination.\n\nTo find the required vaccination coverage, we substitute this expression for $s$ into the herd immunity condition:\n$$1 - \\mathrm{VE} \\cdot V  \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\nWe must solve this inequality for $V$.\n$$1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}  \\mathrm{VE} \\cdot V$$\n$$\\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0}  \\mathrm{VE} \\cdot V$$\nAssuming $\\mathrm{VE}  0$, we can divide by $\\mathrm{VE}$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$V  \\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0 \\cdot \\mathrm{VE}}$$\nThe minimal vaccination proportion, $V_{\\min}$, required to achieve herd immunity is the lower bound of this inequality.\n$$V_{\\min} = \\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0 \\cdot \\mathrm{VE}}$$\nThis equation provides the minimal vaccination proportion as a function of the basic reproduction number and vaccine effectiveness.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for $V_{\\min}$ using the given parameters for measles: $R_0 = 15$ and $\\mathrm{VE} = 0.95$.\n$$V_{\\min} = \\frac{15 - 1}{15 \\cdot 0.95} = \\frac{14}{14.25}$$\n$$V_{\\min} \\approx 0.982456...$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the minimal vaccination proportion is $0.982$.\n\nFinally, we quantify the sensitivity to a $5$ percentage-point absolute reduction in $\\mathrm{VE}$.
