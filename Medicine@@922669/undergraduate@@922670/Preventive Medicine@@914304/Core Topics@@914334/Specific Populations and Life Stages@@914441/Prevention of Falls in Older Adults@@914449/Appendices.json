They use the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test with a threshold of $13.5\\,\\mathrm{s}$ to classify patients as screen-positive (at elevated fall risk) or screen-negative. In the target population of adults aged $\\geq 70$ years, the annual probability of experiencing at least one fall (treated here as the pre-test probability or prevalence for the binary outcome “will fall in the next year”) is $0.20$.

It is based on standard principles of biostatistics and epidemiology and provides all necessary data for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nWe begin by formally defining the events and probabilities based on the provided information.\nLet $D$ be the event that an individual from the target population will experience at least one fall within the next year.\nLet $\\neg D$ be the complementary event that the individual will not fall.\nLet $T$ be the event that the individual tests positive on the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, i.e., their time is greater than or equal to $13.5\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nLet $\\neg T$ be the complementary event that the individual tests negative, i.e., their time is less than $13.5\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\nThe pre-test probability, or prevalence of the condition, is the probability of falling:\n$P(D) = 0.20$\nThe probability of not falling is the complement:\n$P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$\n\nThe operating characteristics of the TUG test at the specified threshold are given by sensitivity and specificity.\nSensitivity is the probability of a positive test result given that the individual will fall (true positive rate):\n$P(T|D) = 0.80$\nSpecificity is the probability of a negative test result given that the individual will not fall (true negative rate):\n$P(\\neg T|\\neg D) = 0.70$\n\nFrom these, we can also define the false negative rate and false positive rate:\nThe false negative rate is the probability of a negative test given that the individual will fall:\n$P(\\neg T|D) = 1 - P(T|D) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$\nThe false positive rate is the probability of a positive test given that the individual will not fall:\n$P(T|\\neg D) = 1 - P(\\neg T|\\neg D) = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30$\n\nThe task is to derive the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV).\n\nThe PPV is the probability that an individual who tests positive will actually fall. This is the conditional probability $P(D|T)$. We derive this from the fundamental definition of conditional probability, $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$.\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = P(D|T) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(T)}\n$$\nThe joint probability $P(D \\cap T)$ can be expressed using the definition of conditional probability again: $P(D \\cap T) = P(T|D)P(D)$.\n$$\nP(D \\cap T) = 0.80 \\times 0.20 = 0.16\n$$\nThe probability of testing positive, $P(T)$, is found using the law of total probability, summing the probabilities of testing positive over all possible states (will fall or will not fall):\n$$\nP(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|\\neg D)P(\\neg D)\n$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$\nP(T) = (0.80)(0.20) + (0.30)(0.80) = 0.16 + 0.24 = 0.40\n$$\nNow we can compute the PPV:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(T)} = \\frac{0.16}{0.40} = 0.40\n$$\n\nThe NPV is the probability that an individual who tests negative will not fall. This is the conditional probability $P(\\neg D|\\neg T)$.\n$$\n\\text{NPV} = P(\\neg D|\\neg T) = \\frac{P(\\neg D \\cap \\neg T)}{P(\\neg T)}\n$$\nThe joint probability $P(\\neg D \\cap \\neg T)$ can be expressed as $P(\\neg D \\cap \\neg T) = P(\\neg T|\\neg D)P(\\neg D)$.\n$$\nP(\\neg D \\cap \\neg T) = 0.70 \\times 0.80 = 0.56\n$$\nThe probability of testing negative, $P(\\neg T)$, is the complement of testing positive, or it can be derived from the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(\\neg T) = 1 - P(T) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60\n$$\nAlternatively, $P(\\neg T) = P(\\neg T|D)P(D) + P(\\neg T|\\neg D)P(\\neg D) = (0.20)(0.20) + (0.70)(0.80) = 0.04 + 0.56 = 0.60$.\nNow we can compute the NPV:\n$$\n\\text{NPV} = \\frac{P(\\neg D \\cap \\neg T)}{P(\\neg T)} = \\frac{0.56}{0.60} = \\frac{56}{60} = \\frac{14}{15}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the expected number of false positives and false negatives for a cohort of $N = 10{,}000$ screened adults.\nThe expected number of individuals who will fall is $N \\times P(D) = 10{,}000 \\times 0.20 = 2000$.\nThe expected number of individuals who will not fall is $N \\times P(\\neg D) = 10{,}000 \\times 0.80 = 8000$.\n\nA false positive (FP) is an individual who will not fall ($\\neg D$) but tests positive ($T$). The expected number of false positives is:\n$$\n\\text{Number of FP} = N \\times P(\\neg D) \\times P(T|\\neg D) = 8000 \\times 0.30 = 2400\n$$\nA false negative (FN) is an individual who will fall ($D$) but tests negative ($\\neg T$). The expected number of false negatives is:\n$$\n\\text{Number of FN} = N \\times P(D) \\times P(\\neg T|D) = 2000 \\times 0.20 = 400\n$$\n\nFinally, we address the trade-offs between false positives and false negatives in this preventive medicine context.\nA false positive occurs when the test incorrectly identifies a healthy individual as being at risk. In this case, $2400$ individuals are told they are at high risk of falling but would not have fallen in the next year. The clinical consequences include unnecessary patient anxiety, the costs and potential side effects of unneeded interventions (e.g., physical therapy, home modifications), and the inefficient allocation of healthcare resources. A high false positive rate can diminish confidence in the screening program.\n\nA false negative occurs when the test fails to identify an individual who is truly at risk. Here, $400$ individuals who will fall are incorrectly told they are at low risk. The consequences are failures of prevention. These individuals miss the opportunity for interventions that could have prevented a fall. For an older adult, a fall can be a catastrophic event leading to severe injury (e.g., hip fracture), disability, loss of independence, and increased mortality. The clinical and public health burden of a false negative in this context is extremely high.\n\nThe choice of a test threshold (here, $13.5\\,\\mathrm{s}$) reflects a necessary trade-off. Increasing sensitivity to reduce the number of devastating false negatives almost invariably decreases specificity, thereby increasing the number of resource-consuming false positives. Conversely, increasing specificity to reduce false positives would increase the number of missed cases (false negatives). For a condition like falls in the elderly, where the consequence of a missed case is severe, clinical practice often favors a higher sensitivity, accepting a higher number of false positives as the cost of preventing a smaller number of highly adverse outcomes. The determined PPV of $0.40$ indicates that $60\\%$ of positive screens are false alarms, yet the NPV of approximately $0.93$ provides strong reassurance for those who screen negative. The screening test successfully stratifies risk, increasing the prevalence of fallers from $20\\%$ in the general population to $40\\%$ in the screen-positive group, thus enabling more efficient targeting of preventive care.\n\nThe final reportable numerical results are:\nSensitivity: $0.80$ (given)\nSpecificity: $0.70$ (given)\nPPV: $0.40$ (derived)\nNPV: $\\frac{14}{15}$ (derived)\nExpected number of false positives: $2400$ (derived)\nExpected number of false negatives: $400$ (derived)\nThese are presented in the requested matrix format in the final answer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.80 & 0.70 & 0.40 & \\frac{14}{15} & 2400 & 400 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4558442"}, {"introduction": "Once a patient is identified as being at high risk, the next step is often to pinpoint modifiable risk factors.

A solution will be derived.\n\nLet $A$ denote the exposure status, where $A=1$ for exposed (benzodiazepine use) and $A=0$ for unexposed. Let $Y$ denote the outcome, where $Y=1$ for a fall. Let $X$ denote the confounder, frailty status, with levels $X=H$ (high) and $X=L$ (low).\n\nThe crude relative risk ($RR_{crude}$) is the ratio of incidence proportions ($IP$) in the exposed and unexposed groups:\n$$ RR_{crude} = \\frac{IP_1}{IP_0} = \\frac{P(Y=1|A=1)}{P(Y=1|A=0)} = \\frac{100/500}{150/1000} = \\frac{0.2}{0.15} = \\frac{4}{3} \\approx 1.333 $$\nThis estimate is likely confounded by frailty. To obtain an adjusted estimate using SIPTW, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate Propensity Scores**\n    The propensity score, $e(X)$, is the probability of exposure given the confounder stratum, $e(X) = P(A=1|X)$. We estimate this from the given counts.\n    -   For the high frailty stratum ($X=H$):\n        $e(H) = P(A=1|X=H) = \\frac{\\text{Number exposed in H}}{\\text{Total number in H}} = \\frac{300}{300+200} = \\frac{300}{500} = 0.6$.\n    -   For the low frailty stratum ($X=L$):\n        $e(L) = P(A=1|X=L) = \\frac{\\text{Number exposed in L}}{\\text{Total number in L}} = \\frac{200}{200+800} = \\frac{200}{1000} = 0.2$.\n\n2.  **Calculate Stabilized Weights**\n    The stabilized weight, $sw_i$, for an individual $i$ with observed exposure $A_i$ and confounder level $X_i$ is given by:\n    $$ sw_i = \\frac{P(A=A_i)}{P(A=A_i|X=X_i)} $$\n    The marginal (overall) probability of exposure is:\n    $P(A=1) = \\frac{500}{500+1000} = \\frac{500}{1500} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    The marginal probability of non-exposure is:\n    $P(A=0) = 1 - P(A=1) = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n    We can now calculate the four unique weights:\n    -   For an exposed individual in the high frailty stratum ($A=1, X=H$):\n        $sw_{1,H} = \\frac{P(A=1)}{P(A=1|X=H)} = \\frac{1/3}{0.6} = \\frac{1/3}{3/5} = \\frac{5}{9}$.\n    -   For an unexposed individual in the high frailty stratum ($A=0, X=H$):\n        $sw_{0,H} = \\frac{P(A=0)}{P(A=0|X=H)} = \\frac{2/3}{1-0.6} = \\frac{2/3}{0.4} = \\frac{2/3}{2/5} = \\frac{5}{3}$.\n    -   For an exposed individual in the low frailty stratum ($A=1, X=L$):\n        $sw_{1,L} = \\frac{P(A=1)}{P(A=1|X=L)} = \\frac{1/3}{0.2} = \\frac{1/3}{1/5} = \\frac{5}{3}$.\n    -   For an unexposed individual in the low frailty stratum ($A=0, X=L$):\n        $sw_{0,L} = \\frac{P(A=0)}{P(A=0|X=L)} = \\frac{2/3}{1-0.2} = \\frac{2/3}{0.8} = \\frac{2/3}{4/5} = \\frac{10}{12} = \\frac{5}{6}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate Adjusted Incidence Proportions**\n    The adjusted incidence proportion for an exposure group is the ratio of the sum of weighted outcomes to the sum of weights.\n    For the exposed group ($A=1$):\n    The numerator is the sum of weighted falls:\n    $$ \\sum_{i: A_i=1} sw_i Y_i = (\\text{falls}_{1,H} \\times sw_{1,H}) + (\\text{falls}_{1,L} \\times sw_{1,L}) = (70 \\times \\frac{5}{9}) + (30 \\times \\frac{5}{3}) = \\frac{350}{9} + 50 = \\frac{350+450}{9} = \\frac{800}{9} $$\n    The denominator is the sum of weights for the exposed. For stabilized weights, this sum equals the original sample size of the group:\n    $$ \\sum_{i: A_i=1} sw_i = (N_{1,H} \\times sw_{1,H}) + (N_{1,L} \\times sw_{1,L}) = (300 \\times \\frac{5}{9}) + (200 \\times \\frac{5}{3}) = \\frac{1500}{9} + \\frac{1000}{3} = \\frac{500}{3} + \\frac{1000}{3} = \\frac{1500}{3} = 500 $$\n    So, the adjusted incidence proportion for the exposed is:\n    $$ IP_{1,adj} = \\frac{800/9}{500} = \\frac{800}{4500} = \\frac{8}{45} $$\n\n    For the unexposed group ($A=0$):\n    The numerator is the sum of weighted falls:\n    $$ \\sum_{i: A_i=0} sw_i Y_i = (\\text{falls}_{0,H} \\times sw_{0,H}) + (\\text{falls}_{0,L} \\times sw_{0,L}) = (30 \\times \\frac{5}{3}) + (120 \\times \\frac{5}{6}) = 50 + 100 = 150 $$\n    The denominator is the sum of weights for the unexposed, which is the group size $1{,}000$:\n    $$ \\sum_{i: A_i=0} sw_i = (N_{0,H} \\times sw_{0,H}) + (N_{0,L} \\times sw_{0,L}) = (200 \\times \\frac{5}{3}) + (800 \\times \\frac{5}{6}) = \\frac{1000}{3} + \\frac{4000}{6} = \\frac{1000}{3} + \\frac{2000}{3} = \\frac{3000}{3} = 1000 $$\n    So, the adjusted incidence proportion for the unexposed is:\n    $$ IP_{0,adj} = \\frac{150}{1000} = 0.15 = \\frac{3}{20} $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Adjusted Relative Risk**\n    The SIPTW-adjusted relative risk ($RR_{adj}$) is the ratio of the adjusted incidence proportions:\n    $$ RR_{adj} = \\frac{IP_{1,adj}}{IP_{0,adj}} = \\frac{8/45}{3/20} = \\frac{8}{45} \\times \\frac{20}{3} = \\frac{160}{135} = \\frac{32}{27} $$\n    As a decimal, this is $32 \\div 27 \\approx 1.185185...$.\n    Rounding to $4$ significant figures gives $1.185$.\n\n5.  **Interpretation**\n    The crude relative risk of approximately $1.33$ suggested a $33\\%$ increase in fall risk among benzodiazepine users. However, the exposed group was disproportionately frail ($60\\%$ high frailty vs. $20\\%$ in the unexposed group), and frailty is strongly associated with falls. After adjusting for this confounding by frailty using SIPTW, the adjusted relative risk is approximately $1.185$. This indicates an $18.5\\%$ increase in fall risk attributable to benzodiazepine use. This result is causally plausible, as benzodiazepines are known to cause sedation, dizziness, and impaired psychomotor function, which directly increase the propensity for falls. The adjustment correctly reduced the magnitude of the effect estimate by accounting for the confounding role of frailty.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.185}$$", "id": "4558479"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of preventive medicine is to implement effective interventions that reduce harm at the population level.

Consider the following scientifically grounded facts and cohort characteristics:\n\n- The baseline $1$-year fall risk for an older adult with neither hyponatremia nor benzodiazepine exposure is $0.20$.\n- Hyponatremia multiplies fall risk by a risk ratio of $1.6$.\n- Benzodiazepine exposure multiplies fall risk by a risk ratio of $1.4$.\n- Medication exposures and hyponatremia probabilities in the cohort:\n  - Proportion on Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): $0.24$ (SSRI only).\n  - Proportion on SSRIs plus thiazide diuretic: $0.11$ (SSRI $+$ thiazide).\n  - Proportion on neither: $0.65$.\n  - Probability of hyponatremia over the year by group: SSRI only $0.10$, SSRI $+$ thiazide $0.25$, neither $0.05$.\n- Benzodiazepine exposure prevalence in the cohort is $0.28$.\n- Decision algorithm to mitigate risk:\n  1.

Express the final number needed to treat as a unitless value. Round your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution.\n\n### Task 1: Mechanistic Explanation\n\nThe increased fall risk from the specified exposures can be explained by their physiological and pharmacological effects.\n\n- **SSRI-induced Hyponatremia:** Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) can cause the Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH) secretion. Elevated levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) lead to excessive water retention by the kidneys, which dilutes the body's sodium, resulting in hyponatremia (low serum sodium concentration, $[\\text{Na}^{+}] < 135\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$). Even mild hyponatremia can impair neurological function, causing symptoms such as gait instability, dizziness, confusion, and concentration deficits. These neurological impairments are direct contributors to an increased risk of falls, particularly in older adults who may have diminished physiological reserves.\n\n- **Benzodiazepine Exposure:** Benzodiazepines are central nervous system (CNS) depressants that enhance the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the $\\text{GABA}_\\text{A}$ receptor. This action results in sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and muscle-relaxant properties. For an older adult, the key effects that increase fall risk are sedation, drowsiness, impaired coordination (ataxia), slowed reaction time, and muscle weakness. These psychomotor and cognitive impairments directly compromise balance and the ability to prevent or recover from a postural disturbance.\n\n- **SSRI + Thiazide Combination:** Thiazide diuretics are a common cause of hyponatremia, primarily through increased renal excretion of sodium (natriuresis) and water, which can lead to volume depletion and a secondary, non-osmotic stimulus for ADH release. When an SSRI (which can cause SIADH) is co-prescribed with a thiazide diuretic, two distinct mechanisms for inducing hyponatremia are active simultaneously. This additive or synergistic effect significantly increases the probability of developing clinically significant hyponatremia compared to using either agent alone, thereby magnifying the associated fall risk.\n\n### Task 2: Decision Algorithm Construction\n\nThe decision algorithm can be formalized into the following structured steps:\n\n1.  **Patient Identification and Stratification:** From the cohort of community-dwelling adults aged $\\geq 75$ years, identify two target subgroups for intervention based on their medication profiles.\n    - **Group A (SSRI Users):** All patients prescribed an SSRI, irrespective of concurrent thiazide use. This constitutes a proportion $P(\\text{SSRI}) = 0.24 + 0.11 = 0.35$ of the cohort.\n    - **Group B (Benzodiazepine Users):** All patients prescribed a benzodiazepine. This constitutes a proportion $P(B) = 0.28$ of the cohort. Note that a patient can belong to both groups.\n\n2.  **Intervention for Group A (SSRI Users):**\n    - **Monitoring:** For every patient in Group A, perform serum sodium concentration $([\\text{Na}^{+}])$ testing at baseline and again at $2$ weeks after initiation or dose change.\n    - **Action:** If hyponatremia (defined as $[\\text{Na}^{+}] < 135\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$) is detected at either time point, a medication review is triggered. Actions include SSRI dose reduction or substitution, or discontinuation of a concurrent thiazide diuretic.\n    - **Expected Outcome:** These actions are expected to resolve the SSRI-associated hyponatremia in a fraction $f_{H\\_corr} = 0.70$ of the cases where it is detected, with the correction being sustained for the year.\n\n3.  **Intervention for Group B (Benzodiazepine Users):**\n    - **Action:** For every patient in Group B, initiate a deprescribing protocol, which involves a structured, patient-centered process of gradual dose reduction with the goal of complete discontinuation.\n    - **Expected Outcome:** This deprescribing attempt is successful in a fraction $f_{B\\_disc} = 0.50$ of benzodiazepine users, with discontinuation sustained for the year.\n\n### Task 3: Quantitative Risk Calculation\n\nThe calculation proceeds by determining the average fall risk in the cohort before and after the intervention, then calculating the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and the number needed to treat (NNT).\n\nLet $R_0 = 0.20$ be the baseline fall risk. Let $H$ denote the state of having hyponatremia and $B$ denote the state of being exposed to benzodiazepines. The risk ratios are $RR_H = 1.6$ and $RR_B = 1.4$. The risk for an individual with a specific profile is:\n- Risk(no H, no B): $R_0 = 0.20$\n- Risk(H, no B): $R_0 \\times RR_H = 0.20 \\times 1.6 = 0.32$\n- Risk(no H, B): $R_0 \\times RR_B = 0.20 \\times 1.4 = 0.28$\n- Risk(H, B): $R_0 \\times RR_H \\times RR_B = 0.20 \\times 1.6 \\times 1.4 = 0.448$\n\n**Pre-Intervention Cohort Risk ($Risk_{pre}$):**\n\nFirst, we calculate the overall baseline prevalence of hyponatremia, $P(H)$, using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(H) = P(H|\\text{SSRI only})P(\\text{SSRI only}) + P(H|\\text{SSRI+Thiazide})P(\\text{SSRI+Thiazide}) + P(H|\\text{Neither})P(\\text{Neither}) $$\n$$ P(H) = (0.10)(0.24) + (0.25)(0.11) + (0.05)(0.65) $$\n$$ P(H) = 0.024 + 0.0275 + 0.0325 = 0.084 $$\nThe prevalence of no hyponatremia is $P(\\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.084 = 0.916$.\n\nThe prevalence of benzodiazepine use is given as $P(B) = 0.28$, so $P(\\neg B) = 1 - 0.28 = 0.72$.\n\nGiven the independence of $H$ and $B$, the overall cohort risk is the product of the baseline risk and the weighted average risk ratios for each factor:\n$$ Risk_{pre} = R_0 \\times [P(\\neg H) + RR_H P(H)] \\times [P(\\neg B) + RR_B P(B)] $$\n$$ Risk_{pre} = 0.20 \\times [0.916 + (1.6)(0.084)] \\times [0.72 + (1.4)(0.28)] $$\n$$ Risk_{pre} = 0.20 \\times [0.916 + 0.1344] \\times [0.72 + 0.392] $$\n$$ Risk_{pre} = 0.20 \\times [1.0504] \\times [1.112] $$\n$$ Risk_{pre} \\approx 0.233609 $$\n\n**Post-Intervention Cohort Risk ($Risk_{post}$):**\n\nNext, we calculate the post-intervention prevalences of hyponatremia ($P(H')$) and benzodiazepine use ($P(B')$).\n\nThe intervention for hyponatremia targets only cases associated with SSRI use. The proportion of the cohort with SSRI-associated hyponatremia is:\n$$ P(H_{\\text{SSRI}}) = (0.10)(0.24) + (0.25)(0.11) = 0.024 + 0.0275 = 0.0515 $$\nThis intervention corrects a fraction $f_{H\\_corr} = 0.70$ of these cases. The reduction in the overall prevalence of hyponatremia is:\n$$ \\Delta P(H) = P(H_{\\text{SSRI}}) \\times f_{H\\_corr} = 0.0515 \\times 0.70 = 0.03605 $$\nThe post-intervention prevalence of hyponatremia is:\n$$ P(H') = P(H) - \\Delta P(H) = 0.084 - 0.03605 = 0.04795 $$\nSo, $P(\\neg H') = 1 - 0.04795 = 0.95205$.\n\nThe intervention for benzodiazepines successfully discontinues use in a fraction $f_{B\\_disc} = 0.50$ of users. The reduction in the prevalence of benzodiazepine use is:\n$$ \\Delta P(B) = P(B) \\times f_{B\\_disc} = 0.28 \\times 0.50 = 0.14 $$\nThe post-intervention prevalence of benzodiazepine use is:\n$$ P(B') = P(B) - \\Delta P(B) = 0.28 - 0.14 = 0.14 $$\nSo, $P(\\neg B') = 1 - 0.14 = 0.86$.\n\nNow we calculate the post-intervention cohort risk using the new prevalences:\n$$ Risk_{post} = R_0 \\times [P(\\neg H') + RR_H P(H')] \\times [P(\\neg B') + RR_B P(B')] $$\n$$ Risk_{post} = 0.20 \\times [0.95205 + (1.6)(0.04795)] \\times [0.86 + (1.4)(0.14)] $$\n$$ Risk_{post} = 0.20 \\times [0.95205 + 0.07672] \\times [0.86 + 0.196] $$\n$$ Risk_{post} = 0.20 \\times [1.02877] \\times [1.056] $$\n$$ Risk_{post} \\approx 0.217276 $$\n\n**Number Needed to Treat (NNT):**\n\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) is the difference between the pre- and post-intervention risks:\n$$ ARR = Risk_{pre} - Risk_{post} \\approx 0.233609 - 0.217276 = 0.016333 $$\nThe NNT is the reciprocal of the ARR. The NNT represents the expected number of patients who must receive the full intervention program to prevent one fall over one year.\n$$ NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.016333} \\approx 61.2268 $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the NNT is $61.2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{61.2}$$", "id": "4558457"}]}
