It is based on standard epidemiological principles and provides sufficient, consistent information for a unique solution.\n\nLet $I_0$ represent the baseline incidence of neural tube defects (NTD) in an unsupplemented population, which serves as the reference or unexposed group.\nLet $I_1$ represent the incidence of NTD in the population supplemented with folic acid, which is the exposed group.\nLet $p$ represent the proportion of the population that adopts the supplementation. Consequently, $1-p$ is the proportion that remains unsupplemented.\nLet $RR$ be the relative risk of NTD for the supplemented group relative to the unsupplemented group.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nThe baseline incidence in the absence of supplementation is $I_0 = 10$ cases per $10{,}000$ live births.\nThe supplementation adoption proportion is $p = 0.70$.\nThe relative risk is $RR = 0.60$.\n\nThe problem defines relative risk as the ratio of the incidence in the exposed group ($I_1$) to the incidence in the unexposed group ($I_0$):\n$$RR = \\frac{I_1}{I_0}$$\nFrom this relationship, we can determine the incidence in the supplemented group, $I_1$, as a function of the baseline incidence and the relative risk:\n$$I_1 = RR \\times I_0$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$I_1 = 0.60 \\times 10 = 6$$\nThus, the incidence of NTD among women who take folic acid supplements is $6$ cases per $10{,}000$ live births.\n\nThe initial population incidence, $I_{initial}$, before the implementation of the program, is equivalent to the baseline incidence in a completely unsupplemented population:\n$$I_{initial} = I_0 = 10$$\nThe units for this and all other incidence values are cases per $10{,}000$ live births.\n\nAfter the program's implementation, the new overall population incidence, $I_{final}$, is the weighted average of the incidences in the supplemented and unsupplemented subgroups.
