We use Bayes' theorem to derive the expression for PPV:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D) P(D)}{P(T)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, which considers both true positives and false positives:\n$$ P(T) = P(T|D) P(D) + P(T|D^c) P(D^c) $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for PPV gives the general formula:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{P(T|D) P(D)}{P(T|D) P(D) + P(T|D^c) P(D^c)} $$\nIn terms of the standard epidemiological definitions, this is:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{(\\text{Sensitivity}) \\times (\\text{Prevalence})}{(\\text{Sensitivity}) \\times (\\text{Prevalence}) + (1-\\text{Specificity}) \\times (1-\\text{Prevalence})} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{(0.90) \\times (0.02)}{(0.90) \\times (0.02) + (1-0.95) \\times (1-0.02)} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.018}{0.018 + (0.05) \\times (0.98)} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.018}{0.018 + 0.049} = \\frac{0.018}{0.067} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV} \\approx 0.2686567... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\text{PPV} \\approx 0.2687$.\n\n**Derivation and Calculation of Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\nThe NPV is the probability that a person does not have the disease given a negative test result, denoted by $P(D^c|T^c)$. We again use Bayes' theorem:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = P(D^c|T^c) = \\frac{P(T^c|D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^c)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^c)$, is the total probability of a negative test result, which includes both true negatives and false negatives. Using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(T^c) = P(T^c|D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^c|D) P(D) $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for NPV gives the general formula:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{P(T^c|D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^c|D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^c|D) P(D)} $$\nIn terms of the standard epidemiological definitions, this is:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{(\\text{Specificity}) \\times (1-\\text{Prevalence})}{(\\text{Specificity}) \\times (1-\\text{Prevalence}) + (1-\\text{Sensitivity}) \\times (\\text{Prevalence})} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{(0.95) \\times (1-0.02)}{(0.95) \\times (1-0.02) + (1-0.90) \\times (0.02)} $$\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{(0.95) \\times (0.98)}{(0.95) \\times (0.98) + (0.10) \\times (0.02)} $$\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{0.931}{0.931 + 0.002} = \\frac{0.931}{0.933} $$\n$$ \\text{NPV} \\approx 0.9978563... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\text{NPV} \\approx 0.9979$.\n\n**Discussion on Shared Decision-Making**\nThe calculated Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is $0.2687$, while the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) is $0.9979$. These values are critical for informing shared decision-making between a clinician and a patient regarding PSA screening.\n\nThe high NPV (99.79%) is a primary benefit of the test. It means that a negative result provides a very high degree of confidence that the patient does not have clinically significant prostate cancer. This can provide significant reassurance.\n\nConversely, the low PPV (26.87%) is the principal source of potential harm. It demonstrates that even with a positive test, there is less than a 27% chance that the patient actually has the disease. The majority of positive tests (approximately 73%) are false positives. A positive result initiates a cascade of follow-up actions, including patient anxiety and invasive diagnostic procedures like a prostate biopsy. Biopsies carry risks such as pain, bleeding, and infection. Furthermore, the issue of overdiagnosis is significant; PSA testing can detect indolent, slow-growing cancers that would never have caused symptoms or death. Treating these overdiagnosed cancers (overtreatment) exposes patients to the serious side effects of therapy (e.g., erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence) without any clinical benefit.\n\nThe stark contrast between the test's high sensitivity (90%) and specificity (95%) and its low PPV highlights a fundamental principle of diagnostic testing: predictive values are heavily dependent on the prevalence of the disease in the population being tested. In this low-prevalence setting (2%), even a test with good intrinsic characteristics will yield a large proportion of false positives.\n\nIn a shared decision-making context, the clinician must articulate this trade-off. The discussion should focus on whether the patient's desire for the reassurance of a negative result outweighs their tolerance for the anxiety, potential complications from follow-up procedures, and risks of overdiagnosis and overtreatment that are associated with a positive result. The decision to screen is therefore a preference-sensitive one, contingent on individual patient values.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.2687 & 0.9979 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4547975"}, {"introduction": "After interpreting an individual test, it is crucial to evaluate its impact on a population level.
