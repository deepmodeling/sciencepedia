The infant’s recumbent length is measured as $58$ centimeters. Consistent with preventive medicine principles in child health, monitoring should be based on corrected age for preterm infants until at least $104$ weeks ($2$ years). The applicable length-for-age reference at the corrected age provides Lambda-Mu-Sigma (LMS) parameters: $L=-0.1$, $M=60.5$, and $S=0.04$.\n\nUsing the corrected age approach for preterm infants, compute:\n- the corrected age in weeks, and\n- the length-for-age $z$-score using the LMS method with the provided $L$, $M$, and $S$ parameters and the measured length.\n\nRound both the corrected age and the $z$-score to three significant figures. Express the corrected age in weeks and the $z$-score as a decimal. Provide your final answer as two values in the order (corrected age in weeks, $z$-score).", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of two quantities for a preterm infant: the corrected age and the length-for-age z-score. The solution will proceed in two parts, addressing each calculation systematically.\n\nFirst, we determine the infant's corrected age. The corrected age, also known as adjusted age, is a critical metric in pediatric preventive medicine for assessing the growth of preterm infants. It is calculated by subtracting the duration of prematurity from the infant's chronological age. A standard full-term gestation is considered to be $40$ weeks.\n\nThe degree of prematurity is the difference between the standard full-term gestation and the infant's gestational age at birth. The given data are:\n- Gestational age at birth: $32$ weeks.\n- Chronological age at visit: $16$ weeks.\n\nWe calculate the prematurity as follows:\n$$\n\\text{Prematurity} = (\\text{Full-term gestation}) - (\\text{Gestational age at birth})\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Prematurity} = 40 \\text{ weeks} - 32 \\text{ weeks} = 8 \\text{ weeks}\n$$\nNext, we use the prematurity to find the corrected age:\n$$\n\\text{Corrected Age} = (\\text{Chronological Age}) - (\\text{Prematurity})\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Corrected Age} = 16 \\text{ weeks} - 8 \\text{ weeks} = 8 \\text{ weeks}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that this result should be rounded to three significant figures. To express the integer $8$ with three significant figures, we write it as $8.00$. Thus, the corrected age is $8.00$ weeks.\n\nSecond, we compute the length-for-age z-score using the Lambda-Mu-Sigma (LMS) method. The z-score quantifies the deviation of an individual measurement from the population median in units of standard deviation. The formula for the z-score ($Z$) when the box-cox transformation parameter $L$ is not equal to zero is:\n$$\nZ = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{Y}{M}\\right)^L - 1}{L \\cdot S}\n$$\nwhere:\n- $Y$ is the measured value (recumbent length).\n- $L$ (Lambda) is the skewness parameter of the data distribution.\n- $M$ (Mu) is the median value of the measurement in the reference population.\n- $S$ (Sigma) is the coefficient of variation.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Measured recumbent length, $Y = 58$ cm.\n- LMS parameters: $L = -0.1$, $M = 60.5$ cm, and $S = 0.04$.\n\nThe ratio $\\frac{Y}{M}$ is dimensionless because both $Y$ and $M$ are in the same units (cm). We substitute the given values into the z-score formula:\n$$\nZ = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{58}{60.5}\\right)^{-0.1} - 1}{(-0.1) \\cdot (0.04)}\n$$\nWe proceed with the calculation step-by-step. First, the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{Y}{M} = \\frac{58}{60.5} \\approx 0.958677686\n$$\nNext, we raise this ratio to the power of $L$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{Y}{M}\\right)^L \\approx (0.958677686)^{-0.1} \\approx 1.00424570\n$$\nThe numerator of the z-score expression is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{Y}{M}\\right)^L - 1 \\approx 1.00424570 - 1 = 0.00424570\n$$\nThe denominator is the product of $L$ and $S$:\n$$\nL \\cdot S = (-0.1) \\cdot (0.04) = -0.004\n$$\nFinally, we compute the z-score by dividing the numerator by the denominator:\n$$\nZ = \\frac{0.00424570}{-0.004} \\approx -1.061425\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the z-score to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $1$, $0$, and $6$. Therefore, the z-score is approximately $-1.06$.\n\nIn summary, the corrected age for the infant is $8.00$ weeks, and the corresponding length-for-age z-score is $-1.06$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n8.00  -1.06\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4510051"}, {"introduction": "Beyond physical growth, developmental screening is a cornerstone of child health surveillance.

In the ASQ-3, each domain has six items scored as follows: a caregiver response of \"Yes\" is scored as $10$ points, \"Sometimes\" is scored as $5$ points, and \"Not yet\" is scored as $0$ points. The domain score is the sum of the six item scores. For decision-making, the clinic defines a child as screening positive for potential delay in a domain if the domain score is strictly less than the domain’s decision threshold for the child’s assessed age.\n\nThe clinic corrects for prematurity until $24$ months using the standard definition: corrected age is obtained by subtracting the number of weeks born early from the chronological age, with $4$ weeks equated to $1$ month for this purpose. To avoid discontinuities between ASQ-3 age-specific forms, the clinic models a continuous decision threshold by linear interpolation between the two bracketing published age-specific cutoffs for that domain.\n\nA child presents for screening at a chronological age of $22$ months and was born at a gestational age of $36$ weeks. The domain being evaluated is Communication. The published cutoffs for the Communication domain are $20.0$ points at $18$ months and $27.0$ points at $24$ months.

The child’s chronological age is $22$ months. The child was born at $36$ weeks’ gestation, which is $40 - 36 = 4$ weeks early. Using the standard correction until $24$ months and taking $4$ weeks as $1$ month, the corrected age is:\n$$22 \\text{ months} - \\frac{4 \\text{ weeks}}{4 \\text{ weeks per month}} = 22 - 1 = 21 \\text{ months}.$$\nHence, the corrected age is $21$ months.\n\nSecond, compute the interpolated decision threshold $T$ at $21$ months by linear interpolation between the published cutoffs at $18$ and $24$ months. Let the cutoff at $18$ months be $C_{18} = 20.0$ points and at $24$ months be $C_{24} = 27.0$ points. Linear interpolation over the interval from $18$ to $24$ months gives:\n$$T = C_{18} + \\frac{21 - 18}{24 - 18}\\left(C_{24} - C_{18}\\right) = 20.0 + \\frac{3}{6}\\left(27.0 - 20.0\\right).$$\nCompute the difference in cutoffs:\n$$27.0 - 20.0 = 7.0.$$\nCompute the fraction:\n$$\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}.$$\nThus,\n$$T = 20.0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 7.0 = 20.0 + 3.5 = 23.5.$$\n\nThird, compute the domain score $S$ from the six item responses using the ASQ-3 scoring rules.

The child screens positive for potential delay if $S  T$. Compute the margin $M$:\n$$M = S - T = 30 - 23.5 = 6.5.$$\nSince $M \\ge 0$, equivalently $30 \\ge 23.5$, the child does not screen positive in this domain.\n\nPer the instruction, report the exact value of $M$ in points.

A child’s growth percentile is not static, and understanding the dynamics of change is key to sound clinical judgment.

Weight-for-age percentiles using World Health Organization (WHO) standards are recorded at $3$ months and $9$ months of age. At $3$ months, the child’s weight-for-age is at the $95$th percentile; at $9$ months, it is at the $40$th percentile. Over the same interval, length-for-age changes modestly from the $60$th percentile at $3$ months to the $55$th percentile at $9$ months. There is no reported intercurrent illness, and feeding is described as adequate by the caregiver.\n\nAssume the following foundational facts and definitions:\n- WHO growth standards define weight-for-age and length-for-age $z$-scores as standardized variables in the reference population, with median corresponding to $z=0$ and percentiles given by $p=\\Phi(z)$, where $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.\n- In a reference population, repeated $z$-scores for the same child at different ages can be modeled as jointly normally distributed random variables. Let $Z_{3}$ and $Z_{9}$ denote weight-for-age $z$-scores at $3$ and $9$ months respectively, with $\\operatorname{Corr}(Z_{3},Z_{9})=\\rho$. For early infancy, take $\\rho=0.7$ as the population tracking correlation for weight-for-age $z$-scores between $3$ and $9$ months.\n- “Major percentile lines” on WHO growth charts are at approximately $3\\%$, $15\\%$, $50\\%$, $85\\%$, and $97\\%$, corresponding to $z$-scores near $-1.88$, $-1.04$, $0$, $1.04$, and $1.88$ respectively. Crossing two major percentile lines downward implies moving past two of these thresholds in the downward direction.\n\nUsing only these foundational principles and the observed data, determine which interpretation best differentiates normal centile channeling (expected regression toward the mean in early infancy) from pathological growth faltering for this child’s weight pattern between $3$ and $9$ months.\n\nChoose the single best option:\n\nA. Normal centile channeling driven by expected regression to the mean in early infancy; reassurance and routine follow-up are sufficient.\n\nB. Pathological weight faltering that is unlikely to be explained by regression to the mean; initiate targeted nutritional and medical assessment now.\n\nC. Normal pattern if exclusively breastfed; schedule routine follow-up at $12$ months without further evaluation.\n\nD. Likely measurement error; repeat measurement in $3$ weeks and otherwise no action is needed unless a further drop occurs.", "solution": "The problem requires a quantitative assessment of the observed change in weight-for-age percentiles to distinguish between expected statistical variation (regression to the mean) and a change suggesting a pathological process. We will use the provided statistical model of jointly normally distributed z-scores.\n\nFirst, we convert the given percentiles into z-scores using the inverse of the standard normal cumulative distribution function, $z = \\Phi^{-1}(p)$.\n*   At 3 months, the weight is at the 95th percentile ($p_3 = 0.95$), so the z-score is $z_3 = \\Phi^{-1}(0.95) \\approx 1.645$.\n*   At 9 months, the weight is at the 40th percentile ($p_9 = 0.40$), so the z-score is $z_9 = \\Phi^{-1}(0.40) \\approx -0.253$.\n\nSecond, we calculate the expected z-score at 9 months based on the 3-month measurement, accounting for regression to the mean. Given that the z-scores $Z_3$ and $Z_9$ are modeled as jointly normal with means of 0, standard deviations of 1, and a correlation $\\rho = 0.7$, the conditional expectation is:\n$$E[Z_9 | Z_3 = z_3] = \\rho \\cdot z_3$$\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n$$E[Z_9 | Z_3 = 1.645] = 0.7 \\times 1.645 \\approx 1.1515$$\nThis expected z-score of approximately 1.15 corresponds to the $\\Phi(1.15) \\approx 87.5$th percentile. Therefore, due to normal regression to the mean, a child at the 95th percentile would be expected to drift down to about the 87.5th percentile, not the 40th.\n\nThird, we assess the statistical significance of the deviation. The observed z-score at 9 months, $z_9 \\approx -0.253$, is far below the expected value of $1.1515$. To quantify this, we use the conditional standard deviation:\n$$\\sigma_{9|3} = \\sqrt{1 - \\rho^2} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.7^2} = \\sqrt{0.51} \\approx 0.714$$\nThe observed z-score is standardized relative to its conditional expectation:\n$$Z_{\\text{standardized}} = \\frac{\\text{observed} - \\text{expected}}{\\text{conditional SD}} = \\frac{-0.253 - 1.1515}{0.714} \\approx -1.97$$\nThe observed drop is nearly 2 standard deviations below the expected value, which is a statistically rare event (p ≈ 0.025), making it unlikely to be due to chance alone.\n\nFourth, we apply the clinical heuristic provided. The child's weight percentile dropped from 95% to 40%. The major percentile lines are at 3%, 15%, 50%, 85%, and 97%. The child's percentile has crossed downwards over the 85th and 50th percentile lines, which meets the definition of crossing two major percentile lines and is a clinical sign of concern. The relative stability of length-for-age (60th to 55th percentile) further suggests a pattern of wasting, which is pathological.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **A** is incorrect. The drop is far greater than predicted by regression to the mean.\n*   **B** is correct. The drop is statistically and clinically significant, warranting further investigation.\n*   **C** is incorrect. The WHO charts are the standard for breastfed infants, and this large drop is abnormal on those charts.\n*   **D** is incorrect. While error is a possibility, the data as presented strongly suggests a pathological process is the most likely interpretation.\n\nTherefore, the evidence points towards pathological weight faltering.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4510040"}]}
