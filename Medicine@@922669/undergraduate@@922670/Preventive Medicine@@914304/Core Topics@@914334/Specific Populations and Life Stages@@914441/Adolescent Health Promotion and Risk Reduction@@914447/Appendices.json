We can proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute two measures of disparity for past-$30$-day vaping prevalence between adolescents in low-SES and high-SES schools: the absolute disparity (risk difference) and the relative disparity (risk ratio). The problem specifies that attending a low-SES school is the exposure and attending a high-SES school is the reference category.\n\nFirst, we calculate the prevalence of vaping in each group. Prevalence ($P$) is the proportion of individuals in a population who have a specific attribute or disease at a given point in time. In this cross-sectional study, prevalence is the measure of disease frequency. It is calculated as the number of cases ($x$) divided by the total number of individuals in the sample ($n$).\n\nFor the low-SES group (exposed), the given data are:\n- Sample size, $n_{\\text{low}} = 520$\n- Number reporting vaping, $x_{\\text{low}} = 130$\n\nThe prevalence of vaping in the low-SES group, denoted as $P_{\\text{low}}$, is:\n$$P_{\\text{low}} = \\frac{x_{\\text{low}}}{n_{\\text{low}}} = \\frac{130}{520} = 0.25$$\n\nFor the high-SES group (reference or unexposed), the given data are:\n- Sample size, $n_{\\text{high}} = 680$\n- Number reporting vaping, $x_{\\text{high}} = 68$\n\nThe prevalence of vaping in the high-SES group, denoted as $P_{\\text{high}}$, is:\n$$P_{\\text{high}} = \\frac{x_{\\text{high}}}{n_{\\text{high}}} = \\frac{68}{680} = 0.10$$\n\nNext, we compute the absolute disparity, which is the Risk Difference ($RD$). The $RD$ quantifies the excess risk in the exposed group compared to the unexposed group on an additive scale. It is calculated as the difference in prevalence between the two groups.\n$$RD = P_{\\text{low}} - P_{\\text{high}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated prevalence values:\n$$RD = 0.25 - 0.10 = 0.15$$\nAn absolute disparity of $0.15$ indicates that the prevalence of vaping is $15$ percentage points higher in low-SES schools than in high-SES schools. From a public health perspective, this means there are an estimated $15$ excess cases of vaping for every $100$ students in the low-SES setting attributable to this socioeconomic disparity. Rounding to $4$ significant figures, the value is $0.1500$.\n\nThen, we compute the relative disparity, which is the Risk Ratio ($RR$). The $RR$ quantifies the strength of the association on a multiplicative scale, indicating how many times more likely the exposed group is to experience the outcome compared to the unexposed group.\n$$RR = \\frac{P_{\\text{low}}}{P_{\\text{high}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated prevalence values:\n$$RR = \\frac{0.25}{0.10} = 2.5$$\nA relative disparity of $2.5$ indicates that students in low-SES schools are $2.5$ times as likely to report past-$30$-day vaping as students in high-SES schools. This measure highlights the strength of the association between school SES and vaping behavior. Rounding to $4$ significant figures, the value is $2.500$.\n\nThe final answer requires the absolute disparity and the relative disparity, in that order, rounded to $4$ significant figures.\nThe absolute disparity is $0.1500$.\nThe relative disparity is $2.500$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.1500 & 2.500\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4500927"}, {"introduction": "After identifying a health issue, a common strategy is to implement a screening program to detect individuals at risk. However, a test's utility depends not only on its intrinsic accuracy but also on the prevalence of the condition in the community. This practice problem explores this concept by having you calculate the positive and negative predictive values for an adolescent depression screener, demonstrating how these metrics are essential for allocating clinical resources effectively [@problem_id:4500929].", "problem": "A school district plans an annual universal screening for depressive symptoms in adolescents using the Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents (PHQ-A).

After computing these values, briefly explain how their magnitudes should inform allocation of limited counseling resources between follow-up assessment of screen-positive students and monitoring of screen-negative students. Report your numerical results in the order PPV, NPV.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard application of Bayesian probability and epidemiological principles to a realistic public health screening scenario. All necessary data are provided, and the task is to compute defined quantities and interpret them. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution can be constructed.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that an adolescent has a current depressive disorder, and $D^c$ be the event that an adolescent does not. Let $T+$ be the event of a positive test result (PHQ-A score $\\ge 10$) and $T-$ be the event of a negative test result (PHQ-A score $< 10$).\n\nThe givens can be translated into probabilistic statements:\nThe prevalence of the disorder is $P(D) = 0.15$.\nThe prevalence of not having the disorder is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85$.\nThe sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test given the disorder is present: $P(T+ | D) = 0.82$.\nThe specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test given the disorder is absent: $P(T- | D^c) = 0.88$.\n\nFrom these givens, we can also determine the rates of incorrect test results:\nThe false positive rate (FPR) is the probability of a positive test given the disorder is absent: $P(T+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T- | D^c) = 1 - 0.88 = 0.12$.\nThe false negative rate (FNR) is the probability of a negative test given the disorder is present: $P(T- | D) = 1 - P(T+ | D) = 1 - 0.82 = 0.18$.\n\nThe quantities to be computed are the positive predictive value (PPV), defined as $P(D | T+)$, and the negative predictive value (NPV), defined as $P(D^c | T-)$. These can be calculated using Bayes' theorem.\n\nFirst, we calculate the PPV. The PPV is the probability that a subject with a positive test result truly has the disorder.\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(D | T+) = \\frac{P(T+ | D) P(D)}{P(T+)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test result. It is found using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(T+) = P(T+ | D) P(D) + P(T+ | D^c) P(D^c) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ P(T+) = (0.82)(0.15) + (0.12)(0.85) $$\n$$ P(T+) = 0.123 + 0.102 = 0.225 $$\nNow we can compute the PPV:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.123}{0.225} \\approx 0.54666... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the PPV is $0.5467$.\n\nNext, we calculate the NPV. The NPV is the probability that a subject with a negative test result is truly free of the disorder.\n$$ \\text{NPV} = P(D^c | T-) = \\frac{P(T- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T-)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T-)$, is the overall probability of a negative test result. We can find this using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(T-) = P(T- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T- | D) P(D) $$\nAlternatively, since there are only two outcomes ($T+$ or $T-$), $P(T-) = 1 - P(T+)$.\n$$ P(T-) = 1 - 0.225 = 0.775 $$\nLet's verify this with the first formula:\n$$ P(T-) = (0.88)(0.85) + (0.18)(0.15) $$\n$$ P(T-) = 0.748 + 0.027 = 0.775 $$\nThe results match. Now we can compute the NPV:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{P(T- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T-)} = \\frac{(0.88)(0.85)}{0.775} = \\frac{0.748}{0.775} \\approx 0.96516... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the NPV is $0.9652$.\n\nThe computed values are PPV $\\approx 0.5467$ and NPV $\\approx 0.9652$.\n\nThe magnitudes of these values have direct implications for resource allocation.\nThe PPV of $0.5467$ indicates that of all students who screen positive, only about $54.7\\%$ actually have the depressive disorder. The remaining $45.3\\%$ are false positives. While the test successfully enriches the screened population from a baseline prevalence of $15\\%$ to a post-test probability of $54.7\\%$, a positive screen is not diagnostic by itself. A substantial portion of positive results are incorrect. This mandates that counseling resources be heavily allocated to comprehensive follow-up diagnostic assessments for all screen-positive students to differentiate true positives from false positives before initiating treatment. Allocating treatment resources based solely on a positive screen would be highly inefficient and inappropriate for the nearly half of screen-positives who do not have the disorder.\n\nThe NPV of $0.9652$ is very high. This means that among students who screen negative, there is a $96.5\\%$ probability that they are truly free of the disorder. The probability of a missed case (a false negative) in this group is low, at $1 - \\text{NPV} \\approx 1 - 0.9652 = 0.0348$, or about $3.5\\%$. This high NPV provides strong reassurance that a negative result is reliable. Therefore, it is justifiable to allocate minimal intensive resources toward the large screen-negative group. This allows the limited counseling resources to be concentrated on the smaller, higher-risk, screen-positive population. While universal prevention and general mental health monitoring are still prudent for all students, the screening results support a stratified approach where intensive follow-up is reserved almost exclusively for those who screen positive.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.5467 & 0.9652 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4500929"}, {"introduction": "Ultimately, the goal of health promotion is to implement interventions that effectively reduce risk.

The problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of epidemiology and evidence-based medicine, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed in objective, formalizable language. The provided probabilities for pregnancy, $p_c = 0.13$ for typical condom use and $p_i = 0.001$ for contraceptive implants, are well within realistic ranges for one-year failure rates, confirming the problem's scientific plausibility. All criteria for a valid problem are met.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) to prevent one pregnancy over a one-year horizon. The NNT is a standard metric in epidemiology used to quantify the impact of an intervention. It is derived from the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR).\n\nFirst, we define and calculate the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR). The ARR represents the absolute difference in the risk of an adverse outcome between the control group and the intervention group. In this context, the adverse outcome is pregnancy. The risk in the control group (current practice, i.e., condoms) is given by the annual probability $p_c$, and the risk in the intervention group (implant) is given by the annual probability $p_i$.\n\nThe problem explicitly provides the formula for ARR:\n$$ARR = p_c - p_i$$\n\nThe given values are:\n- The annual probability of pregnancy for the control group, $p_c = 0.13$.\n- The annual probability of pregnancy for the intervention group, $p_i = 0.001$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for ARR, we obtain:\n$$ARR = 0.13 - 0.001 = 0.129$$\nThis value, $0.129$, signifies that the contraceptive implant intervention reduces the absolute risk of pregnancy by $12.9$ percentage points over one year compared to the current practice.\n\nNext, we calculate the Number Needed to Treat (NNT). The NNT is defined as the number of individuals who must receive an intervention for a specific period to prevent one adverse event. Mathematically, the NNT is the reciprocal of the ARR for the same time horizon. The time horizon specified in the problem is one year, which matches the period for which the probabilities $p_c$ and $p_i$ are defined.\n\nThe formula for NNT is:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\n\nUsing the calculated value for ARR:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.129}$$\n\nPerforming the division gives the numerical value for NNT:\n$$NNT \\approx 7.75193798...$$\n\nThe problem statement requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $7$, $7$, and $5$. The fourth significant figure is $1$. Since $1 < 5$, we round down, meaning the third significant figure remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the NNT rounded to three significant figures is $7.75$. This means that, on average, for every $7.75$ adolescents who receive the contraceptive implant instead of relying on condoms under typical use, one pregnancy will be prevented over the course of one year. It is standard practice in reporting NNT to round up to the next whole number (i.e., $8$) because treating a fraction of a person is not clinically meaningful. However, the problem explicitly asks for a numerical answer rounded to three significant figures, which directs us to provide the value $7.75$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.75}$$", "id": "4500963"}]}
