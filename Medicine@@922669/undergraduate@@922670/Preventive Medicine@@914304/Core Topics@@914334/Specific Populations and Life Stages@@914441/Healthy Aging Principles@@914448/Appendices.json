The problem specifies the patient is an $80$-year-old woman, weighing $60$ \\text{ kg}, with a serum creatinine (SCr) of $1.0$ \\text{ mg/dL}. The CG equation for estimating CrCl in \\text{ mL/min} is:\n$$ \\text{CrCl} = \\frac{(140 - \\text{Age}) \\times \\text{Weight}}{\\text{k} \\times \\text{SCr}} $$\nwhere age is in years, weight is in \\text{kg}, and SCr is in \\text{mg/dL}. The constant $k$ is $72$ for males. For females, the problem specifies using the standard sex correction, which involves multiplying the result by $0.85$. This is equivalent to adjusting the denominator, but it is conventionally applied as a final multiplier.\n\nLet's denote the patient's age as $A$, weight as $W$, and serum creatinine as $SCr_{patient}$. The given values are:\n$A = 80$ years\n$W = 60$ \\text{kg}\n$SCr_{patient} = 1.0$ \\text{mg/dL}\n\nApplying the Cockcroft-Gault formula with the correction for women:\n$$ \\text{CrCl}_{\\text{patient}} = 0.85 \\times \\frac{(140 - A) \\times W}{72 \\times SCr_{patient}} $$\nSubstituting the patient's data into the formula:\n$$ \\text{CrCl}_{\\text{patient}} = 0.85 \\times \\frac{(140 - 80) \\times 60}{72 \\times 1.0} $$\n$$ \\text{CrCl}_{\\text{patient}} = 0.85 \\times \\frac{60 \\times 60}{72} $$\n$$ \\text{CrCl}_{\\text{patient}} = 0.85 \\times \\frac{3600}{72} $$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$ \\frac{3600}{72} = \\frac{360 \\times 10}{36 \\times 2} = \\frac{10 \\times 10}{2} = 50 $$\nNow, we complete the calculation for the patient's CrCl:\n$$ \\text{CrCl}_{\\text{patient}} = 0.85 \\times 50 = 42.5 \\text{ mL/min} $$\n\nThe second step is to adjust the maintenance dose of the medication. The problem states that the medication is fully renally cleared, pharmacokinetics are linear, bioavailability is unchanged, and the target average steady-state concentration ($C_{ss,avg}$) is the same as for the reference dose.\n\nThe average steady-state concentration is given by the relationship:\n$$ C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{F \\times \\text{Dosing Rate}}{CL_{total}} $$\nwhere $F$ is bioavailability and $CL_{total}$ is total body clearance. The dosing rate is the dose per unit time (e.g., \\text{mg/day}). Since the medication is fully renally cleared, its total clearance is equal to the renal clearance, which is estimated by the creatinine clearance. Thus, $CL_{total} \\approx \\text{CrCl}$.\n\nLet $\\text{Dose}_{\\text{ref}}$ and $\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{ref}}$ be the reference dose and reference clearance, and $\\text{Dose}_{\\text{adj}}$ and $\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{patient}}$ be the adjusted dose and the patient's clearance. To maintain the same $C_{ss,avg}$ with unchanged bioavailability $F$, the following must hold:\n$$ \\frac{F \\times (\\text{Dose}_{\\text{ref}}/\\text{day})}{ \\text{CrCl}_{\\text{ref}}} = \\frac{F \\times (\\text{Dose}_{\\text{adj}}/\\text{day})}{ \\text{CrCl}_{\\text{patient}}} $$\nThe term $F$ and the dosing interval (1 day) cancel out, leading to a direct proportionality between dose and clearance:\n$$ \\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\text{ref}}}{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{ref}}} = \\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\text{adj}}}{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{patient}}} $$\nWe can solve for the adjusted dose, $\\text{Dose}_{\\text{adj}}$:\n$$ \\text{Dose}_{\\text{adj}} = \\text{Dose}_{\\text{ref}} \\times \\frac{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{patient}}}{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{ref}}} $$\nThe problem provides the reference values:\n$\\text{Dose}_{\\text{ref}} = 200$ \\text{mg/day}\n$\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{ref}} = 100$ \\text{mL/min}\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$ \\text{Dose}_{\\text{adj}} = 200 \\text{ mg/day} \\times \\frac{42.5 \\text{ mL/min}}{100 \\text{ mL/min}} $$\n$$ \\text{Dose}_{\\text{adj}} = 200 \\text{ mg/day} \\times 0.425 $$\n$$ \\text{Dose}_{\\text{adj}} = 85 \\text{ mg/day} $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.

Finally, briefly interpret the clinical significance of this value in the context of healthy aging principles.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of epidemiology and preventive medicine, is well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and is free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of two key epidemiological measures: the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and the number needed to treat (NNT), based on fundamental definitions of risk.\n\nLet $R_C$ represent the risk of the adverse event (experiencing at least one fall) in the control or unexposed population over a one-year period. This corresponds to the baseline annual probability.\nLet $R_T$ represent the risk of the adverse event in the treatment or exposed population (i.e., those participating in the fall-prevention program) over the same one-year period.\n\nFrom the problem statement, the given values are:\nThe baseline annual probability of a fall, $R_C = 0.30$.\nThe annual probability of a fall with the intervention, $R_T = 0.24$.\n\nFirst, we derive the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR). The ARR is defined as the absolute difference in the event rates between the control group and the treatment group. It quantifies the absolute decrease in risk attributable to the intervention. The formula, derived directly from this definition, is:\n$$\nARR = R_C - R_T\n$$\nSubstituting the given values into this formula:\n$$\nARR = 0.30 - 0.24 = 0.06\n$$\nThis value, $0.06$, signifies that the intervention reduces the absolute probability of a fall by $6$ percentage points. Equivalently, it means that for every $100$ individuals who participate in the program, $6$ falls are prevented.\n\nNext, we derive the Number Needed to Treat (NNT). The NNT is defined as the average number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one additional adverse outcome. If the ARR represents the number of adverse events prevented per individual treated, then the number of individuals one must treat to prevent exactly one event is the mathematical reciprocal of the ARR.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of people treated. The total number of events prevented in this group is $N \\times ARR$. We are interested in the value of $N$ for which the number of events prevented is exactly $1$.\n$$\nN \\times ARR = 1\n$$\nSolving for $N$, which is the NNT, we get:\n$$\nNNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}\n$$\nUsing the calculated value of ARR:\n$$\nNNT = \\frac{1}{0.06}\n$$\nTo compute the numerical value:\n$$\nNNT = \\frac{1}{\\frac{6}{100}} = \\frac{100}{6} = \\frac{50}{3} \\approx 16.666...\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final NNT to two significant figures. The first two significant figures of $16.666...$ are $1$ and $6$. The third digit is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the second digit.\n$$\nNNT \\approx 17\n$$\nThe number needed to treat is $17$.\n\nFinally, for the clinical interpretation in the context of healthy aging principles: An NNT of $17$ means that, on average, for every $17$ community-dwelling older adults who participate in the multifactorial fall-prevention program for one year, one fall is averted that would have otherwise occurred. Falls in older adults are a major geriatric syndrome leading to significant morbidity (e.g., fractures, head injuries), loss of confidence, reduced mobility, decreased independence, and increased mortality. Healthy aging principles focus on maintaining functional ability, independence, and quality of life for as long as possible. An NNT in the range of $17$ is generally considered to represent a clinically effective intervention. It indicates that the program provides a substantial benefit and is a reasonably efficient use of resources to achieve a critical goal of preventive medicine for older populations—preserving their health and autonomy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{17}$$", "id": "4536321"}, {"introduction": "A screening test has inherent properties like sensitivity and specificity, but does this mean it performs equally well in all populations?

Assume the test’s diagnostic sensitivity and specificity do not vary by age. Let $S_e$ denote sensitivity, $S_p$ denote specificity, and let $p$ denote the age-stratum prevalence of sarcopenia.

Express each PPV as a decimal and round to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on the fundamental principles of probability theory, specifically Bayes' theorem, and its application in medical diagnostics, a core concept in epidemiology and biostatistics. All necessary data are provided, and the terminology is standard and unambiguous. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that an individual has sarcopenia (the \"Disease\" state), and let $D^c$ be the event that the individual does not have sarcopenia. Let $T^+$ be the event that the screening test result is positive, and $T^-$ be the event that it is negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following definitions and values:\n1.  Prevalence, $p$, is the prior probability of having the disease: $p = P(D)$.\n2.  Sensitivity, $S_e$, is the probability of a positive test given the individual has the disease: $S_e = P(T^+ \\mid D)$. The provided value is $S_e = 0.88$.\n3.  Specificity, $S_p$, is the probability of a negative test given the individual does not have the disease: $S_p = P(T^- \\mid D^c)$. The provided value is $S_p = 0.94$.\n\nThe quantity to be derived is the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), which is defined as the probability that an individual has the disease given that their test result is positive: $\\text{PPV} = P(D \\mid T^+)$.\n\nWe begin by applying Bayes' theorem to the definition of PPV:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} $$\nThe numerator contains terms that are directly given: $P(T^+ \\mid D) = S_e$ and $P(D) = p$.\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. It can be expanded using the law of total probability by conditioning on the disease state:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D) + P(T^+ \\mid D^c) P(D^c) $$\nWe can identify each term in this expansion:\n- $P(T^+ \\mid D) = S_e$ (Sensitivity)\n- $P(D) = p$ (Prevalence)\n- $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - p$\n- $P(T^+ \\mid D^c)$ is the false positive rate. This can be derived from specificity, $S_p$. Since an individual either tests positive or negative, $P(T^+ \\mid D^c) + P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 1$. By definition, $S_p = P(T^- \\mid D^c)$, so it follows that $P(T^+ \\mid D^c) = 1 - S_p$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(T^+)$ gives:\n$$ P(T^+) = S_e \\cdot p + (1 - S_p)(1 - p) $$\nNow, we substitute this expanded form of the denominator back into the Bayes' theorem expression for PPV. This yields the closed-form expression for PPV as a function of $p$, $S_e$, and $S_p$:\n$$ \\text{PPV}(p, S_e, S_p) = \\frac{S_e \\cdot p}{S_e \\cdot p + (1 - S_p)(1 - p)} $$\n\nTo explain why PPV necessarily changes with prevalence $p$ (for fixed $S_e$ and $S_p$), we can analyze the derived expression. We can show that the PPV is not a constant function of $p$ by examining its derivative with respect to $p$. Let's treat $\\text{PPV}$ as a function of $p$, denoted $f(p)$.\n$$ f(p) = \\frac{S_e p}{S_e p + (1 - S_p)(1 - p)} $$\nTo find the derivative $\\frac{df}{dp}$, we use the quotient rule, $\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$. Let $u = S_e p$ and $v = S_e p + (1 - S_p)(1 - p)$.\nFirst, we find the derivatives of $u$ and $v$ with respect to $p$:\n$u' = \\frac{d}{dp}(S_e p) = S_e$\n$v' = \\frac{d}{dp}(S_e p + (1 - S_p) - p(1 - S_p)) = \\frac{d}{dp}(p(S_e - (1 - S_p)) + (1 - S_p)) = S_e - (1 - S_p) = S_e + S_p - 1$.\n\nApplying the quotient rule:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\text{PPV})}{dp} = \\frac{ S_e [S_e p + (1 - S_p)(1 - p)] - (S_e p) [S_e + S_p - 1] }{ [S_e p + (1 - S_p)(1 - p)]^2 } $$\nLet's simplify the numerator:\n$$ S_e^2 p + S_e(1 - S_p)(1 - p) - S_e^2 p - S_e p(S_p - 1) $$\n$$ S_e(1 - S_p)(1 - p) + S_e p(1 - S_p) $$\n$$ S_e(1 - S_p) [ (1 - p) + p ] $$\n$$ S_e(1 - S_p) $$\nSo, the derivative is:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\text{PPV})}{dp} = \\frac{S_e (1 - S_p)}{[S_e p + (1 - S_p)(1 - p)]^2} $$\nFor the PPV function to be constant with respect to $p$, its derivative must be zero. The denominator is the square of $P(T^+)$, which is non-zero for any meaningful clinical scenario ($0  p  1$, $S_e > 0$, $S_p  1$). The numerator is the product $S_e (1 - S_p)$. In this problem, $S_e = 0.88$ and $S_p = 0.94$. Since $S_e \\neq 0$ and $S_p \\neq 1$, the numerator $0.88 \\times (1 - 0.94) = 0.88 \\times 0.06 = 0.0528$ is non-zero. Since the derivative is not zero, the function $\\text{PPV}(p)$ is not constant. This demonstrates that PPV necessarily changes with prevalence $p$.\n\nNow, we compute the PPV for the two specified age strata.\nGiven: $S_e = 0.88$ and $S_p = 0.94$.\n\nFor the first age stratum (ages $55$ to $64$):\nThe prevalence is $p_1 = 0.12$.\n$$ \\text{PPV}_1 = \\frac{S_e \\cdot p_1}{S_e \\cdot p_1 + (1 - S_p)(1 - p_1)} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV}_1 = \\frac{0.88 \\times 0.12}{0.88 \\times 0.12 + (1 - 0.94)(1 - 0.12)} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV}_1 = \\frac{0.1056}{0.1056 + (0.06)(0.88)} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV}_1 = \\frac{0.1056}{0.1056 + 0.0528} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV}_1 = \\frac{0.1056}{0.1584} = 0.666666... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\text{PPV}_1 = 0.6667$.\n\nFor the second age stratum (ages $75$ to $84$):\nThe prevalence is $p_2 = 0.28$.\n$$ \\text{PPV}_2 = \\frac{S_e \\cdot p_2}{S_e \\cdot p_2 + (1 - S_p)(1 - p_2)} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV}_2 = \\frac{0.88 \\times 0.28}{0.88 \\times 0.28 + (1 - 0.94)(1 - 0.28)} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV}_2 = \\frac{0.2464}{0.2464 + (0.06)(0.72)} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV}_2 = \\frac{0.2464}{0.2464 + 0.0432} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV}_2 = \\frac{0.2464}{0.2896} \\approx 0.8508287... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\text{PPV}_2 = 0.8508$.\n\nThe calculations confirm the derived dependence: as prevalence increases from $p_1 = 0.12$ to $p_2 = 0.28$, the positive predictive value also increases.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.6667  0.8508 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4536454"}]}
