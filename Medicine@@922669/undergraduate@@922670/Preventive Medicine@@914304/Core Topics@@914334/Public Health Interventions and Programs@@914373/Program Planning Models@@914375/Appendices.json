Consider a composite Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) constructed from three protective indicators: median household income (denoted $I$), proportion of adults with a bachelor’s degree (denoted $E$), and housing stability (proportion of households residing at the same address for at least two years, denoted $H$).\n\nTo combine indicators that are on different scales, first compute standardized scores using the well-tested definition of a $z$-score: for each indicator $X \\in \\{I, E, H\\}$, set $z_{X} = (x_{X} - \\mu_{X}) / \\sigma_{X}$, where $x_{X}$ is the community’s value, $\\mu_{X}$ is the reference population mean, and $\\sigma_{X}$ is the reference population standard deviation.

This exercise introduces the Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY), a comprehensive metric used in the epidemiological assessment phase of planning.

To characterize the burden of disease, the county epidemiology unit adopts Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY), defined as the sum of Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to premature mortality and Years Lived with Disability (YLD) due to non-fatal morbidity over the period, i.e., $DALY = YLL + YLD$.\n\nThe county reports the following one-year data for diabetes:\n\n- Mortality: $30$ deaths at age $60$ with a standard remaining life expectancy at age $60$ of $22.0$ years, and $20$ deaths at age $70$ with a standard remaining life expectancy at age $70$ of $14.5$ years.\n- Morbidity (prevalence-based accounting over the year):\n  - $6000$ individuals with mild diabetes, average symptomatic duration in the year of $0.80$ years with disability weight $0.093$.\n  - $3000$ individuals with moderate diabetes, average symptomatic duration in the year of $1.00$ years with disability weight $0.207$.\n  - $1000$ individuals with severe diabetes, average symptomatic duration in the year of $1.00$ years with disability weight $0.316$.\n\nUsing only the standard definitions of Years of Life Lost and Years Lived with Disability as components of Disability-Adjusted Life Years over a one-year horizon, compute the total diabetes DALYs for this county.

Express the final DALYs in years.", "solution": "The solution is presented in two parts as requested by the problem statement. The first part is the quantitative calculation of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). The second part is a qualitative explanation of the implications of this calculation within the PRECEDE-PROCEED program planning model.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY)**\n\nThe total DALYs are defined as the sum of Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to premature mortality and Years Lived with Disability (YLD) due to morbidity. The formula is:\n$$DALY = YLL + YLD$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total YLL. YLL for a specific cause of death is found by multiplying the number of deaths ($N$) by the standard life expectancy ($L$) at the age of death.\n$$YLL = N \\times L$$\nThe problem specifies two mortality groups. We will calculate the YLL for each and sum them.\n\nFor the first group, $N_1 = 30$ deaths at age $60$, with a standard remaining life expectancy of $L_1 = 22.0$ years.\n$$YLL_1 = N_1 \\times L_1 = 30 \\times 22.0 = 660 \\text{ years}$$\nFor the second group, $N_2 = 20$ deaths at age $70$, with a standard remaining life expectancy of $L_2 = 14.5$ years.\n$$YLL_2 = N_2 \\times L_2 = 20 \\times 14.5 = 290 \\text{ years}$$\nThe total YLL from diabetes is the sum of these two values:\n$$YLL_{total} = YLL_1 + YLL_2 = 660 + 290 = 950 \\text{ years}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total YLD. For a prevalence-based accounting over a one-year period, the YLD for a specific condition is calculated by multiplying the number of individuals with the condition ($I$) by their average symptomatic duration within the year ($D$) and the disability weight ($DW$) corresponding to the condition's severity.\n$$YLD = I \\times D \\times DW$$\nThe problem provides data for three morbidity groups. We will calculate the YLD for each and sum them.\n\nFor mild diabetes: $I_{mild} = 6000$, $D_{mild} = 0.80$ years, and $DW_{mild} = 0.093$.\n$$YLD_{mild} = 6000 \\times 0.80 \\times 0.093 = 446.4 \\text{ years}$$\nFor moderate diabetes: $I_{mod} = 3000$, $D_{mod} = 1.00$ year, and $DW_{mod} = 0.207$.\n$$YLD_{mod} = 3000 \\times 1.00 \\times 0.207 = 621 \\text{ years}$$\nFor severe diabetes: $I_{sev} = 1000$, $D_{sev} = 1.00$ year, and $DW_{sev} = 0.316$.\n$$YLD_{sev} = 1000 \\times 1.00 \\times 0.316 = 316 \\text{ years}$$\nThe total YLD from diabetes is the sum of these three values:\n$$YLD_{total} = YLD_{mild} + YLD_{mod} + YLD_{sev} = 446.4 + 621 + 316 = 1383.4 \\text{ years}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the total DALYs by summing the total YLL and total YLD.\n$$DALY_{total} = YLL_{total} + YLD_{total} = 950 + 1383.4 = 2333.4 \\text{ years}$$\nThe problem requires rounding the result to four significant figures.\n$$DALY_{total} \\approx 2333 \\text{ years}$$\n\n**Part 2: Implications within the PRECEDE-PROCEED Framework**\n\nThe PRECEDE-PROCEED model provides a comprehensive structure for health program planning. The calculated DALYs are a central element of the epidemiological assessment and inform resource allocation decisions throughout the model's phases.\n\nPhase 2: Epidemiological Assessment. The DALY calculation is the formal output of this phase. The total burden of $2333$ DALYs quantifies the health loss due to diabetes in the county, establishing a baseline for intervention and an advocacy tool for resource mobilization. The crucial insight for prioritization comes from disaggregating the DALYs. Here, the burden from morbidity ($YLD = 1383.4$) is greater than the burden from mortality ($YLL = 950$), indicating that preventive strategies must prioritize not just saving lives, but also improving the quality of life for those living with diabetes. Further analysis of the $YLD$ components reveals that moderate diabetes contributes the largest share of the morbidity burden ($621$ YLDs). This allows public health officials to set highly specific, measurable objectives, such as targeting interventions to prevent the progression from mild to moderate diabetes, or improving management of moderate cases to reduce their associated disability.\n\nPhase 3: Educational and Ecological Assessment. The DALY-based priorities from Phase 2 guide the search for causal factors. Planners would investigate the predisposing (e.g., low health literacy), reinforcing (e.g., lack of social support for lifestyle changes), and enabling (e.g., high cost of insulin, lack of safe parks for exercise) factors that contribute to the specific outcomes driving the DALYs. Since the highest burden is from moderate morbidity ($YLD_{mod}$), assessment would focus on factors leading to poor glycemic control. Since the mortality burden ($YLL$) is also substantial, factors contributing to fatal complications would also be a priority. The DALY analysis allows for a targeted investigation of behaviors and environmental factors linked to the most significant health losses.\n\nPhase 4: Administrative & Policy Assessment and Intervention Alignment. The quantifiable burden of $2333$ DALYs serves as powerful evidence to justify the allocation of financial and human resources. It translates the abstract problem of diabetes into a concrete loss of healthy life-years, which is a compelling argument for decision-makers. This metric can be used to compare diabetes to other diseases, ensuring that investments are proportional to the health burden. The finding that $YLD > YLL$ can be used to advocate for policies and programs that support chronic disease management and disability prevention, such as subsidies for continuous glucose monitors or funding for community-based self-management education programs.\n\nPhases 5-8: PROCEED (Implementation and Evaluation). The DALY metric is the ultimate outcome measure for evaluating the program's success. In Phase 8 (Outcome Evaluation), DALYs would be recalculated after the program period. A reduction in the total DALYs from the baseline of $2333$ would demonstrate the overall effectiveness of the preventive investment. Moreover, observing which component of DALYs was reduced (e.g., a decrease in $YLL$ vs. $YLD$, or a reduction in $YLD_{mod}$) would provide specific feedback on which aspects of the program were most successful, thereby guiding future planning cycles. This makes evaluation more robust and informative than relying on simpler metrics like prevalence or mortality rates alone.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2333}$$", "id": "4564059"}, {"introduction": "With a clear picture of the problem and the target population, planning shifts towards action and resource allocation.
