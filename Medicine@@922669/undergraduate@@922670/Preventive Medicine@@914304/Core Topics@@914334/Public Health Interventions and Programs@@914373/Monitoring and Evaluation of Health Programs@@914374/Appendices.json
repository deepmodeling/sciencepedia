The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded in the principles of public health program monitoring, and provides all necessary data for a unique solution.\n\nFirst, let us formally define the variables based on the data provided in the problem statement.\nLet $N_{enrolled}$ be the number of enrolled students.\n$N_{enrolled} = 8,000$.\n\nLet $N_{non-enrolled}$ be the estimated number of non-enrolled eligible children.\n$N_{non-enrolled} = 2,000$.\n\nLet $D_{total}$ be the total number of unique doses administered across all platforms.\n$D_{total} = 8,500$.\n\nLet $D_{school}$ be the number of doses delivered during school-based sessions, which were restricted to enrolled students.\n$D_{school} = 7,200$.\n\nThe problem states that the remainder of the doses were delivered through community outreach to non-enrolled children.

The solution will be derived in two corresponding parts.\n\nPart 1: Total Economic Cost ($C_{total}$)\n\nThe total economic cost is the sum of all direct costs (supplies, personnel, transport) and indirect overhead costs.\n\n1.  Cost of Supplies ($C_{supplies}$)\n    This includes the economic cost of the vaccine, syringes, swabs, and safety boxes.\n\n    a.  Vaccine Cost ($C_{vaccine}$): The program administers $D_{admin} = 10,000$ doses. The point-of-use wastage rate is $W_r = 10\\% = 0.1$.

This requires calculating the number of children who begin the vaccination series ($N_{start}$).\n\n1.  Number of Children Starting the Series ($N_{start}$)\n    The total of $D_{admin} = 10,000$ doses are distributed among three groups of children starting the series. We can set up an equation where $N_{start}$ is the total number of children receiving at least one dose.\n    -   $10\\%$ of children receive $1$ dose: $0.10 \\times N_{start} \\times 1$ dose/child\n    -   $20\\%$ of children receive $2$ doses: $0.20 \\times N_{start} \\times 2$ doses/child\n    -   $70\\%$ of children receive $3$ doses: $0.70 \\times N_{start} \\times 3$ doses/child\n    The sum of all administered doses is $10,000$:\n    $$10,000 = (0.10 \\times 1 \\times N_{start}) + (0.20 \\times 2 \\times N_{start}) + (0.70 \\times 3 \\times N_{start})$$\n    $$10,000 = N_{start} \\times (0.10 + 0.40 + 2.10) = N_{start} \\times 2.60$$\n    Solving for $N_{start}$:\n    $$N_{start} = \\frac{10,000}{2.60} \\approx 3,846.15$$\n\n2.  Number of Fully Immunized Children ($N_{FIC}$)\n    A child is fully immunized upon receiving all three doses. According to the problem, this group constitutes $70\\%$ of the children who start the series.\n    $$N_{FIC} = N_{start} \\times 0.70 = \\frac{10,000}{2.60} \\times 0.70 = \\frac{7,000}{2.60} \\approx 2,692.31$$\n\n3.  Cost per Fully Immunized Child ($C_{FIC}$)\n    This is the ratio of the total economic cost to the number of fully immunized children.\n    $$C_{FIC} = \\frac{C_{total}}{N_{FIC}} = \\frac{\\$53,960.56}{2,692.31} \\approx \\$20.0425$$\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the economic cost per fully immunized child is $\\$20.0$.\n\nFinal Answers:\n1) The total economic cost of delivering $10,000$ administered doses is $\\$53,960.56$, which rounds to $\\$54,000$.

This requires calculating the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) and comparing it to a given Willingness-To-Pay (WTP) threshold.\n\nThe problem provides the following givens:\n-   Incremental Cost, denoted as $\\Delta C$: The additional budget outlay for the new program is $\\$500,000$.\n-   Incremental Health Effect, denoted as $\\Delta E$: The additional health gain, measured in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) averted, is $300$ DALYs.\n-   Willingness-To-Pay (WTP) Threshold: The maximum amount the health department is willing to pay per DALY averted is $\\$1,500$.\n\nThe Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) is defined as the incremental cost divided by the incremental health effect.

The ICER represents the price of achieving one unit of health gain (in this case, averting one DALY) through the new program. The WTP threshold represents the maximum price the decision-maker (the health department) is willing to pay for that same unit of health gain. The analysis shows that the cost to avert one DALY with this new program ($\\$1,667$) exceeds the value the department places on averting one DALY ($\\$1,500$). From a resource allocation perspective, funding this program would mean paying more for health gains than the pre-established acceptable cost. Therefore, based on this quantitative evaluation, the health department's resources could be used more efficiently by investing in other programs that have an ICER at or below the $\\$1,500$ per DALY threshold.
