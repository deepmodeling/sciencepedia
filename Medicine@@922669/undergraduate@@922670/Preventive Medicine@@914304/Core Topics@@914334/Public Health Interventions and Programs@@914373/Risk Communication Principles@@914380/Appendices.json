The primary adverse event is a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke. In the control arm, the observed event risk is $0.15$.

Clinicians must translate these findings into patient-centered metrics that uphold risk communication principles, which emphasize clarity, transparency, and clinical relevance.\n\nStarting strictly from the core definitions of probability of an event (risk), odds, and ratios thereof, derive and compute the following effect measures between intervention and control: Relative Risk (RR), Odds Ratio (OR), Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR), Relative Risk Reduction (RRR), and Number Needed to Treat (NNT).

Risk is defined as the probability of an event occurring within a specified time frame. The problem provides the following givens for a time horizon of $T=1$ year:\n$$R_C = P(\\text{event} | \\text{control}) = 0.15$$\n$$R_I = P(\\text{event} | \\text{intervention}) = 0.09$$\n\nFrom these fundamental probabilities, we can derive the requested effect measures. The odds of an event are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring.\n$$ \\text{Odds} = \\frac{P(\\text{event})}{1 - P(\\text{event})} $$\nThus, the odds in the control and intervention arms are:\n$$ O_C = \\frac{R_C}{1-R_C} = \\frac{0.15}{1-0.15} = \\frac{0.15}{0.85} = \\frac{15}{85} = \\frac{3}{17} $$\n$$ O_I = \\frac{R_I}{1-R_I} = \\frac{0.09}{1-0.09} = \\frac{0.09}{0.91} = \\frac{9}{91} $$\n\nWe now proceed to derive and compute each required measure.\n\n**1. Relative Risk (RR)**\nThe Relative Risk is the ratio of the risk in the intervention group to the risk in the control group.\n$$ RR = \\frac{R_I}{R_C} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ RR = \\frac{0.09}{0.15} = \\frac{9}{15} = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6 $$\nInterpretation for a patient: \"If you join the program, your risk of a heart attack or stroke over the next year is $0.6$ times what your risk would be without the program.\"\n\n**2. Odds Ratio (OR)**\nThe Odds Ratio is the ratio of the odds of an event in the intervention group to the odds of an event in the control group.\n$$ OR = \\frac{O_I}{O_C} = \\frac{R_I / (1-R_I)}{R_C / (1-R_C)} $$\nSubstituting the calculated odds:\n$$ OR = \\frac{9/91}{3/17} = \\frac{9}{91} \\times \\frac{17}{3} = \\frac{3 \\times 17}{91} = \\frac{51}{91} \\approx 0.5604 $$\nImplication for communication: In this case, the baseline risk $R_C = 0.15$ is not small. Consequently, the Odds Ratio ($OR \\approx 0.56$) is not a good approximation of the Relative Risk ($RR = 0.6$). When communicating with patients, using the OR may overstate the magnitude of the effect (since $0.56$ is a greater reduction from $1$ than $0.6$ is), and it is generally less intuitive than the RR; thus, its use should be avoided in patient-centered discussions.\nInterpretation for a patient: \"The odds of having a heart attack or stroke are almost halved if you join the program, but this measure is complex and may be less clear than other metrics.\"\n\n**3. Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)**\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction is the arithmetic difference in risk between the control and intervention groups. It represents the actual reduction in risk attributable to the intervention.\n$$ ARR = R_C - R_I $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ ARR = 0.15 - 0.09 = 0.06 $$\nInterpretation for a patient: \"Over one year, this program would reduce your personal chance of having a heart attack or stroke from $15$ in $100$ down to $9$ in $100$.\"\n\n**4. Relative Risk Reduction (RRR)**\nThe Relative Risk Reduction is the proportion of the baseline risk that is eliminated by the intervention. It can be calculated from the ARR or the RR.\n$$ RRR = \\frac{R_C - R_I}{R_C} = \\frac{ARR}{R_C} = 1 - RR $$\nUsing the calculated values:\n$$ RRR = \\frac{0.06}{0.15} = \\frac{6}{15} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4 $$\nAlternatively:\n$$ RRR = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4 $$\nInterpretation for a patient: \"The program reduces your risk of a heart attack or stroke by $40\\%$ over one year compared to what your risk would have been otherwise.\"\n\n**5. Number Needed to Treat (NNT)**\nThe Number Needed to Treat is the average number of patients who must undergo the intervention for a specified duration to prevent one adverse event. It is the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Reduction.\n$$ NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR} $$\nSubstituting the calculated ARR:\n$$ NNT = \\frac{1}{0.06} = \\frac{1}{6/100} = \\frac{100}{6} = \\frac{50}{3} \\approx 16.66\\overline{6} $$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to $2$ significant figures. The first two significant digits are $1$ and $6$. The following digit is $6$, so we round up.\n$$ NNT \\approx 17 $$\nInterpretation for a patient: \"To prevent one person from having a heart attack or stroke, about $17$ people would need to participate in this program for one year.\"", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{17} $$", "id": "4569181"}, {"introduction": "Beyond treatment effectiveness, a core task in preventive medicine is communicating the meaning of screening test results.

Vaccine effectiveness (VE) is defined from first principles as $VE = 1 - RR$, where relative risk (RR) is $RR = I_v / I_u$, $I_v$ is the incidence among vaccinated individuals, and $I_u$ is the incidence among unvaccinated individuals. Because $VE \\in [0,1]$, it is commonly reported as a percentage. In the report, Vaccine A has $VE_A = 93\\%$ and Vaccine B has $VE_B = 96\\%$. The chart’s $y$-axis is truncated to run from $90\\%$ to $100\\%$, and the bars rise to $93\\%$ and $96\\%$ respectively. Many readers conclude that Vaccine B is “about twice as effective” as Vaccine A because the $96\\%$ bar appears roughly twice the height of the $93\\%$ bar above the $90\\%$ baseline.\n\nUsing only the core definitions above and the general principle that, in a bar chart, the displayed height encodes the mapped value relative to the plotted scale, analyze how truncating the $y$-axis to $90\\%$–$100\\%$ affects the perceived magnitude of differences between $VE_A$ and $VE_B$.

It provides all necessary definitions and data to perform a rigorous analysis. The definitions of vaccine effectiveness ($VE$) and relative risk ($RR$) are standard in epidemiology.\n\nThe core task is to analyze the perceptual distortion created by using a truncated y-axis on a bar chart and to identify an appropriate correction. The fundamental principle of a bar chart is that the length of the bar, originating from a zero baseline, encodes the magnitude of the quantity. The human visual system compares these lengths to interpret ratios.\n\nLet $v_A$ and $v_B$ be the true values of vaccine effectiveness for Vaccine A and Vaccine B, respectively. We are given $v_A = 93\\% = 0.93$ and $v_B = 96\\% = 0.96$.\n\nOn a standard bar chart with a zero baseline (from $y_{min,0} = 0\\%$ to $y_{max} = 100\\%$), the height of the bars, $H_0(v)$, would be directly proportional to their values:\n$$H_0(v_A) \\propto v_A = 93$$\n$$H_0(v_B) \\propto v_B = 96$$\nThe ratio of the true heights is $H_0(v_B) / H_0(v_A) = 96/93 \\approx 1.032$. This means Vaccine B's effectiveness is about $3.2\\%$ greater than Vaccine A's effectiveness. The absolute difference is $\\Delta v = v_B - v_A = 96\\% - 93\\% = 3$ percentage points.\n\nNow, consider the truncated chart, where the y-axis runs from $y_{min,T} = 90\\%$ to $y_{max} = 100\\%$. In a bar chart, the visible height of a bar, $H_T(v)$, is proportional to the difference between its value and the baseline:\n$$H_T(v) \\propto (v - y_{min,T})$$\nFor the given vaccines:\n$$H_T(v_A) \\propto (93 - 90) = 3$$\n$$H_T(v_B) \\propto (96 - 90) = 6$$\nThe ratio of the perceived bar heights is $H_T(v_B) / H_T(v_A) = 6/3 = 2$. This creates the visual impression that Vaccine B is \"twice as effective\" as Vaccine A, a severe distortion of the actual ratio of $\\approx 1.032$.\n\nNext, we determine the multiplicative factor by which the absolute difference is magnified. The absolute difference is $\\Delta v = v_B - v_A = 3$ percentage points.\n\nOn a full scale from $0\\%$ to $100\\%$, the total range is $S_0 = 100\\% - 0\\% = 100\\%$. The difference $\\Delta v$ represents a fraction $F_0 = \\Delta v / S_0 = 3/100$ of the total scale.\n\nOn the truncated scale from $90\\%$ to $100\\%$, the total range is $S_T = 100\\% - 90\\% = 10\\%$. The same absolute difference $\\Delta v$ now represents a fraction $F_T = \\Delta v / S_T = 3/10$ of the visible scale.\n\nThe visual magnification factor, $M$, is the ratio of the fractional representation on the truncated scale to that on the full scale:\n$$M = \\frac{F_T}{F_0} = \\frac{3/10}{3/100} = \\frac{3}{10} \\times \\frac{100}{3} = 10$$\nMore generally, for a chart truncated from a baseline $y_{min}$ to a maximum $y_{max}$, compared to a zero-baseline chart up to the same $y_{max}$, the magnification factor is:\n$$M = \\frac{y_{max} - 0}{y_{max} - y_{min}}$$\nIn this case, representing values as decimals from $0$ to $1$:\n$$M = \\frac{1.00 - 0}{1.00 - 0.90} = \\frac{1}{0.10} = 10$$\nA $3$ percentage-point difference is thus made to appear $10$ times as large as it would on a chart with a proper zero baseline.\n\nThe appropriate correction must address this perceptual distortion. One solution is to adhere to the fundamental rule of bar charts and use a zero baseline (e.g., $0\\%-100\\%$). While this may make small differences harder to discern, it presents the data honestly. An alternative, superior approach for highlighting small differences in a statistically sound manner is to switch to a chart type that does not use length from zero to encode value. A dot plot or line plot is ideal. On such a plot, value is encoded by position. The axis can be truncated to zoom in on the region of interest without creating a proportional distortion. Furthermore, since these are statistical estimates, reporting them without uncertainty is incomplete. Including $95\\%$ Confidence Intervals (CIs) for each estimate is crucial to communicate whether the observed difference is statistically significant.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n\n**A. A $y$-axis truncated to $90\\%$–$100\\%$ rescales bar-height differences by a factor of $1/(1.00 - 0.90) = 10$, so a $3$ percentage-point difference appears $10$ times larger in proportional bar height than it would on a $0\\%$–$100\\%$ axis; the appropriate correction is to use a zero-baseline scale (for example, $0\\%$–$100\\%$) for bars or to switch to a dot/line plot on the full $0\\%$–$100\\%$ scale with $95\\%$ Confidence Intervals (CI).**\nThis option correctly performs the calculation for the magnification factor, arriving at $10$. It accurately describes the effect of the truncation. The proposed corrections are the standard best practices in data visualization and statistics for this exact situation: either enforce the zero baseline for the bar chart or switch to a chart type (dot/line plot) that is not subject to this specific distortion and allows for the inclusion of uncertainty measures like CIs. The mention of using the full scale for the dot/line plot is slightly suboptimal, as the point of a dot plot is that you *can* zoom in, but the core corrections are sound.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Truncating the $y$-axis at $90\\%$–$100\\%$ is acceptable for vaccine effectiveness because values are near an upper bound of $100\\%$; no correction is needed as long as the axis is labeled.**\nThis is incorrect. The fact that the values are near an upper bound does not negate the principles of graphical perception. The visual distortion of ratios caused by a non-zero baseline in a bar chart is a well-established phenomenon. Simply labeling the axis is insufficient to counteract the powerful, and misleading, primary visual message conveyed by the bar lengths.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Truncating the $y$-axis at $90\\%$–$100\\%$ understates differences because the bars are shorter; the correction is to further restrict the axis to $95\\%$–$100\\%$.**\nThis statement mistakes the effect. Truncation *overstates* or *magnifies* the relative difference, it does not understate it. The proposed correction—to truncate the axis even more—would exacerbate the distortion, not fix it. For example, on a $95\\%-100\\%$ axis, the bar for Vaccine A ($93\\%$) would not even be visible.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Visual exaggeration only occurs when comparing more than two vaccines; with two groups, the effect is negligible. The correction is to add data labels showing $93\\%$ and $96\\%$ while keeping the truncated axis.**\nThis is false. The problem demonstrates a significant exaggeration with only two groups (a perceived $100\\%$ increase in effectiveness vs an actual $3.2\\%$ increase). While adding data labels is helpful, it is a patch, not a fix for a fundamentally misleading graphic. The primary visual encoding should be honest.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. The main problem is confusion between absolute and relative risk; the correction is to report only relative risk reduction and omit charts altogether.**\nThis misidentifies the problem. The quantity being charted, $VE = 1 - RR$, is relative risk reduction. The problem is not a confusion between different epidemiological measures but the *graphical communication* of a single measure. Abandoning graphical communication is a poor solution; the goal is to use graphics correctly and effectively.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4569267"}]}
