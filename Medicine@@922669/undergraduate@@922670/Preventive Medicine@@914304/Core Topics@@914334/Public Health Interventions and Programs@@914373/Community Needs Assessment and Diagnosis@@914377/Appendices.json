The concepts of cumulative risk (also known as cumulative incidence or risk), risk difference, and relative risk are standard measures of disease frequency and association used in public health and preventive medicine.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data (risks for exposed and unexposed groups) to calculate the requested measures. The questions asked are specific and have unique, well-defined answers based on standard epidemiological formulas.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, scientific language, free from bias or subjective claims.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The provided data are sufficient and consistent. There are no contradictions.\n5.  **Realism**: The scenario of a community health assessment and the given risk values ($0.30$ for smokers, $0.10$ for non-smokers) for chronic cough are plausible within a real-world context.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard, well-posed question in epidemiology. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two fundamental epidemiologic measures of association—one absolute and one relative—and an explanation of their utility in public health practice. Let us define the provided terms symbolically.\n\nLet $R_{exp}$ be the cumulative risk of the outcome (chronic cough) in the exposed group (daily smokers).\nLet $R_{unexp}$ be the cumulative risk of the outcome in the unexposed group (non-smokers).\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n$$R_{exp} = 0.30$$\n$$R_{unexp} = 0.10$$\n\n**1. Computation of the Measure of Absolute Difference in Risk**\n\nThe measure of absolute difference in risk is known as the **Risk Difference (RD)**, also referred to as Attributable Risk in the exposed. It quantifies the excess risk in the exposed group that is attributable to the exposure. The formula is:\n$$RD = R_{exp} - R_{unexp}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$RD = 0.30 - 0.10 = 0.20$$\nThe absolute difference in risk is $0.20$.\n\n**2. Computation of the Measure of Relative Risk**\n\nThe measure of relative risk is known as the **Relative Risk (RR)** or **Risk Ratio**. It quantifies the magnitude of the association between exposure and outcome by indicating how many times more likely the exposed group is to develop the outcome compared to the unexposed group. The formula is:\n$$RR = \\frac{R_{exp}}{R_{unexp}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$RR = \\frac{0.30}{0.10} = 3.0$$\nThe relative risk is $3.0$.\n\n**3. Explanation for Community Diagnosis and Priority-Setting**\n\nBoth the Risk Difference (RD) and the Relative Risk (RR) provide critical, yet distinct, information for community health assessment and the setting of public health priorities.\n\n**Risk Difference (RD)**:\nThe calculated $RD$ of $0.20$ is a measure of **public health impact**. It represents the absolute excess risk of chronic cough due to smoking. This value implies that over a $12$-month period, $20$ excess cases of chronic cough occur for every $100$ daily smokers, compared to the number of cases that would be expected if they were non-smokers. For community diagnosis, the RD directly estimates the burden of disease in the population that is attributable to the exposure. When setting priorities, the RD is invaluable because it helps to quantify the potential number of disease cases that could be prevented if the exposure were eliminated from the population. A large RD, even if the RR is modest, points to a significant public health problem that warrants intervention, as a successful program could avert a substantial number of cases.\n\n**Relative Risk (RR)**:\nThe calculated $RR$ of $3.0$ is a measure of the **strength of association**. It indicates that daily smokers are $3$ times as likely to develop chronic cough as non-smokers over the $12$-month period. For community diagnosis, a high RR provides strong evidence for a causal relationship between the exposure (smoking) and the outcome (chronic cough). It is a powerful tool for communicating risk to the public and policymakers, as it clearly illustrates the increased danger associated with the exposure. In priority-setting, a high RR helps to identify etiologically important risk factors. While it does not directly measure the number of cases an intervention would prevent (as the RD does), it strengthens the justification for targeting a specific risk factor, particularly when establishing the scientific rationale for an action plan.\n\nIn summary, the health assessment team would use the $RR=3.0$ to argue that smoking is a potent cause of chronic cough in their district. They would then use the $RD=0.20$ to estimate the potential impact of a smoking cessation program, arguing that such an intervention could prevent $20$ cases of chronic cough for every $100$ smokers who quit, thus providing a quantitative basis for resource allocation and program planning.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.20 & 3.0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4512809"}, {"introduction": "Implementing a screening program requires understanding how a test performs in a specific population, which goes beyond its intrinsic sensitivity and specificity.

The derivation will be based on the fundamental definitions of these quantities and Bayes' theorem.\n\nFirst, let us define the relevant events:\n- $D$: The event that an individual has the chronic condition.\n- $\\neg D$: The event that an individual does not have the condition.\n- $T^+$: The event that the screening test result is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the screening test result is negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following probabilities:\n- Prevalence: $\\pi = P(D) = 0.10$. The probability of not having the condition is therefore $P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - \\pi = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\n- Sensitivity: $Se = P(T^+ | D) = 0.90$.

Bayes' theorem for the event $D$ given $T^+$ is:\n$$PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result.

Using Bayes' theorem for the event $\\neg D$ given $T^-$:\n$$NPV = P(\\neg D | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | \\neg D) P(\\neg D)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test result.

The decision is whether to refer an individual for confirmatory testing based on their estimated posterior probability of having active TB, denoted by $p$. The goal is to minimize the expected harm associated with the decision. This problem can be formalized using the principles of decision theory.\n\nLet $D$ be a random variable representing the true disease state of an individual, where $D=1$ indicates the presence of active TB and $D=0$ indicates its absence. The given probability $p$ is the posterior probability that the individual has TB, so we have $P(D=1) = p$ and, consequently, $P(D=0) = 1-p$.\n\nThe program has two possible actions:\n1.  Action $A_1$: Refer the individual for confirmatory testing. This action is taken if $p \\ge t$.\n2.  Action $A_0$: Do not refer the individual. This action is taken if $p < t$.\n\nHarm occurs only when a decision is erroneous. The problem defines the harms for the two types of errors:\n- A False Positive (FP) occurs when we choose action $A_1$ (refer) for an individual who does not have TB ($D=0$).

The expected harm of an action is the sum of the harms of its possible outcomes, weighted by their respective probabilities.\n\nThe expected harm of referring (Action $A_1$), denoted $E[\\text{Harm}(A_1)]$, is:\n$$\nE[\\text{Harm}(A_1)] = \\text{Harm}(A_1 | D=1) \\cdot P(D=1) + \\text{Harm}(A_1 | D=0) \\cdot P(D=0)\n$$\nThis corresponds to a true positive and a false positive outcome, respectively.\n$$\nE[\\text{Harm}(A_1)] = 0 \\cdot p + H_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\cdot (1-p) = H_{\\mathrm{FP}}(1-p)\n$$\n\nThe expected harm of not referring (Action $A_0$), denoted $E[\\text{Harm}(A_0)]$, is:\n$$\nE[\\text{Harm}(A_0)] = \\text{Harm}(A_0 | D=1) \\cdot P(D=1) + \\text{Harm}(A_0 | D=0) \\cdot P(D=0)\n$$\nThis corresponds to a false negative and a true negative outcome, respectively.\n$$\nE[\\text{Harm}(A_0)] = H_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\cdot p + 0 \\cdot (1-p) = H_{\\mathrm{FN}}p\n$$\n\nTo minimize the expected harm, the optimal strategy for a given individual with probability $p$ is to choose the action with the lower expected harm.
