Two sets of communities are observed during the same three-month period: communities that implemented a structured engagement plan (engaged) and communities that did not (non-engaged). In the engaged set, $540$ out of $900$ eligible individuals completed the screening. In the non-engaged set, $315$ out of $900$ eligible individuals completed the screening.\n\nUsing only foundational definitions of measures of association in epidemiology, compute the risk difference (RD) and relative risk (RR) for screening uptake comparing engaged versus non-engaged communities. Express both quantities as decimals, and round each to four significant figures.

Let the \"engaged\" communities represent the exposed group ($E$) and the \"non-engaged\" communities represent the unexposed group ($\\bar{E}$). The outcome of interest is the completion of the health screening.\n\nThe risk of an outcome is the proportion of a population, initially free of the outcome, that develops the outcome over a specified time period. In this context, it is the proportion of eligible individuals who complete the screening.\n\nLet $R_E$ be the risk of screening completion in the engaged communities (the exposed group).\nLet $R_{\\bar{E}}$ be the risk of screening completion in the non-engaged communities (the unexposed group).\n\nThe givens are:\n-   Number of individuals completing screening in the engaged group, $A_E = 540$.\n-   Total number of eligible individuals in the engaged group, $N_E = 900$.\n-   Number of individuals completing screening in the non-engaged group, $A_{\\bar{E}} = 315$.\n-   Total number of eligible individuals in the non-engaged group, $N_{\\bar{E}} = 900$.\n\nWe can now compute the risks for each group.\nThe risk in the engaged group is the incidence proportion:\n$$R_E = \\frac{A_E}{N_E} = \\frac{540}{900} = 0.6$$\n\nThe risk in the non-engaged group is:\n$$R_{\\bar{E}} = \\frac{A_{\\bar{E}}}{N_{\\bar{E}}} = \\frac{315}{900} = 0.35$$\n\nNext, we compute the requested measures of association.\n\nThe Risk Difference (RD), also known as the attributable risk, is the absolute difference in risk between the exposed and unexposed groups. It is defined as:\n$$RD = R_E - R_{\\bar{E}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$RD = 0.6 - 0.35 = 0.25$$\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures. Thus, $RD = 0.2500$.\n\nThe Relative Risk (RR), also known as the risk ratio, is the ratio of the risk in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group. It is defined as:\n$$RR = \\frac{R_E}{R_{\\bar{E}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$RR = \\frac{0.6}{0.35} = \\frac{60}{35} = \\frac{12}{7} \\approx 1.7142857...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $RR = 1.714$.\n\nThe ordered pair $(\\text{RD}, \\text{RR})$ is $(0.2500, 1.714)$.\n\nFinally, we address the question of causality. The computed measures, $RD = 0.2500$ and $RR = 1.714$, indicate a positive association between the engagement initiative and screening uptake. However, association does not imply causation. The study design described is an observational cohort study, not a randomized controlled trial (RCT). In an observational design, the assignment of the exposure (the structured engagement plan) is not controlled by the investigator. Communities that implemented the plan may differ from those that did not in ways other than the plan itself. This gives rise to the potential for confounding.\n\nFor instance, the communities that chose to adopt the engagement plan might have more motivated community leaders, a population with higher average health literacy, better pre-existing infrastructure for public health programs, or different socio-demographic characteristics. Any of these factors could independently increase screening uptake and would be associated with the \"exposure\" (implementing the plan). Therefore, the observed difference in screening rates might be partially or wholly attributable to these confounding variables rather than to the engagement plan itself. Without random assignment to the engaged and non-engaged groups, which would on average balance both known and unknown confounders, it is impossible to isolate the effect of the initiative and establish a causal link based solely on these associative measures. Establishing causality would require a more rigorous study design or the use of advanced statistical methods to adjust for measured confounders.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.2500 & 1.714\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4512379"}, {"introduction": "After establishing an association, the next critical question is whether we can attribute it to a causal effect of our intervention.

A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe goal is to identify the correct model for estimating the program's causal effect and the correct procedure for testing the key identifying assumption, the parallel trends assumption.\n\n**1. Model for Estimating the Causal Effect**\n\nThe research design is a difference-in-differences (DiD) setup. The causal effect of the program is the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT). The standard regression framework to estimate the ATT in this context is a two-way fixed effects (TWFE) model:\n$$\nY_{it} = \\alpha_i + \\lambda_t + \\beta(D_i \\cdot Post_t) + \\varepsilon_{it}\n$$\n- $Y_{it}$ is the outcome for community $i$ at time $t$.\n- $\\alpha_i$ is a community-specific fixed effect, which controls for all time-invariant characteristics of a community (both observed and unobserved), as per assumption (ii).\n- $\\lambda_t$ is a time-period-specific fixed effect, which controls for any aggregate factors or shocks that affect all communities in a given period, as per assumption (iii).\n- $D_i$ is a treatment indicator, equal to $1$ for treated communities and $0$ for control communities.\n- $Post_t$ is a post-treatment time indicator. Since treatment starts at $t=0$ and the post-treatment period is $t=+1$, $Post_t = \\mathbb{1}\\{t=+1\\}$.\n- The interaction term $D_i \\cdot Post_t$ is equal to $1$ only for treated communities in the post-treatment period.\n- The coefficient $\\beta$ is the DiD estimator of the ATT. It measures the average difference in the change in outcome from the pre-treatment to the post-treatment period for the treated group compared to the control group.\n\n**2. Testing the Parallel Trends Assumption**\n\nThe critical identifying assumption for DiD is that the outcome trends would have been parallel for the treatment and control groups in the absence of treatment. This is formally stated as:\n$$\nE[Y_{i,t}(0) - Y_{i,pre}(0) | D_i=1] = E[Y_{i,t}(0) - Y_{i,pre}(0) | D_i=0]\n$$\nfor post-treatment periods $t$. This assumption about a counterfactual is fundamentally untestable. However, its plausibility can be assessed by examining whether trends were parallel in the *pre-treatment* periods. With data from $t=-2$ and $t=-1$, we can perform a \"placebo\" test.\n\nThe null hypothesis ($H_0$) for this test is that the average change in the outcome from $t=-2$ to $t=-1$ is the same for both groups:\n$$\nH_0: E[Y_{i,-1} - Y_{i,-2} | D_i=1] = E[Y_{i,-1} - Y_{i,-2} | D_i=0]\n$$\nThis is equivalent to testing if the difference-in-differences in the pre-treatment period is zero:\n$$\nH_0: (E[\\overline{Y}_T | t=-1] - E[\\overline{Y}_T | t=-2]) - (E[\\overline{Y}_C | t=-1] - E[\\overline{Y}_C | t=-2]) = 0\n$$\nWe can test this hypothesis using a two-sample t-test on the mean change in outcome.\n\n- Let $\\Delta_T = \\overline{Y}_{T,-1} - \\overline{Y}_{T,-2}$ be the sample mean change for the treated group.\n- Let $\\Delta_C = \\overline{Y}_{C,-1} - \\overline{Y}_{C,-2}$ be the sample mean change for the control group.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n- $\\Delta_T = 0.421 - 0.400 = 0.021$.\n- $\\Delta_C = 0.383 - 0.360 = 0.023$.\n\nThe point estimate of the placebo effect is $\\Delta_T - \\Delta_C = 0.021 - 0.023 = -0.002$.\n\nTo perform the hypothesis test, we compute the t-statistic:\n$$\nt = \\frac{(\\Delta_T - \\Delta_C) - 0}{SE(\\Delta_T - \\Delta_C)}\n$$\nThe standard error of the difference in these mean changes is given by:\n$$\nSE(\\Delta_T - \\Delta_C) = \\sqrt{\\frac{s_T^2}{n_T} + \\frac{s_C^2}{n_C}}\n$$\nwhere $s_T$ and $s_C$ are the sample standard deviations of the change variable $Y_{i,-1} - Y_{i,-2}$. The problem gives these as $\\sigma_T=0.050$ and $\\sigma_C=0.050$. We also have $n_T=30$ and $n_C=30$.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$$\nSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{(0.050)^2}{30} + \\frac{(0.050)^2}{30}} = \\sqrt{2 \\times \\frac{0.0025}{30}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.005}{30}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{6000}} \\approx 0.01291\n$$\nNow, we compute the t-statistic:\n$$\nt = \\frac{-0.002}{0.01291} \\approx -0.1549\n$$\nThis t-value is very close to zero. For a two-tailed test, the p-value will be large. For example, with degrees of freedom approximately $n_T + n_C - 2 = 58$, the critical value for significance at the $\\alpha=0.05$ level is $t^* \\approx \\pm 2.00$. Since $|-0.155| < 2.00$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis $H_0$. This result lends support to the validity of the parallel trends assumption.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Estimate a two-way fixed effects model $Y_{it}=\\alpha_i+\\lambda_t+\\beta\\,(D_i\\cdot Post_t)+\\varepsilon_{it}$, where $Post_t=\\mathbb{1}\\{t=+1\\}$. Test parallel trends by a placebo difference-in-differences using only $t\\in\\{-2,-1\\}$: compute $\\Delta_T=(\\overline{Y}_{T,-1}-\\overline{Y}_{T,-2})$ and $\\Delta_C=(\\overline{Y}_{C,-1}-\\overline{Y}_{C,-2})$, then test $H_0:\\Delta_T-\\Delta_C=0$ with a two-sample $t$-test on changes using $SE=\\sqrt{\\sigma_T^2/n_T+\\sigma_C^2/n_C}$. With the given data, $\\Delta_T=0.021$, $\\Delta_C=0.023$, so the placebo effect is $-0.002$. The standard error is $SE\\approx \\sqrt{0.050^2/30+0.050^2/30}\\approx 0.0129$, yielding $t\\approx -0.15$, and we fail to reject $H_0$ at conventional levels, supporting parallel trends.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option correctly specifies the canonical TWFE model for DiD. It correctly formulates the test for parallel pre-treatment trends as a placebo DiD. The calculation of the pre-trends ($\\Delta_T$, $\\Delta_C$), the placebo effect ($\\Delta_T - \\Delta_C$), the standard error, and the t-statistic are all accurate based on the provided data. The interpretation, that failing to reject the null hypothesis supports the parallel trends assumption, is also correct.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Estimate $Y_{it}=\\gamma\\,(D_i)+u_{it}$ and test parallel trends by checking whether $\\overline{Y}_{T,-1}=\\overline{Y}_{C,-1}$. Since $0.421\\neq 0.383$, conclude that parallel trends fails. Proceed to estimate $\\gamma$ as the program effect.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, the model $Y_{it}=\\gamma\\,(D_i)+u_{it}$ is not a DiD model; it is a simple comparison of group means that ignores the time dimension and cannot isolate the causal effect. Second, the test for parallel trends is wrong. It tests for equality of outcome *levels* in the pre-treatment period ($\\overline{Y}_{T,-1}=\\overline{Y}_{C,-1}$), not equality of *trends*. The DiD assumption does not require pre-treatment levels to be equal, only that their trends are parallel. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the method.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Estimate $Y_{it}=\\alpha_i+\\lambda_t+\\theta\\,(D_i\\cdot t)+\\varepsilon_{it}$ using all three periods, and test parallel trends by $H_0:\\theta=0$. Because $t=+1$ is post-treatment, include it to improve power in testing $\\theta$.**\n- **Evaluation:** The model $Y_{it}=\\alpha_i+\\lambda_t+\\theta\\,(D_i\\cdot t)+\\varepsilon_{it}$ imposes a restrictive linear time trend on the treatment effect. The standard DiD model is more flexible, allowing a level shift post-treatment. More critically, testing for parallel trends ($H_0:\\theta=0$) using data from all three periods is invalid. The post-treatment period ($t=+1$) contains the treatment effect, so the trends are *expected* to diverge. Including post-treatment data to test a pre-treatment condition confounds the test of the assumption with the estimation of the effect. The claim that this improves power is misleading, as it is testing the wrong hypothesis. A proper test must use only pre-treatment data.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Estimate an interrupted time series in the treated group only: $Y_{it}=\\lambda_t+\\beta\\,Post_t+e_{it}$ for $i$ with $D_i=1$. Test parallel trends by verifying that $\\overline{Y}_{T,-2}=\\overline{Y}_{T,-1}$; if they are unequal, parallel trends fails and the program effect is biased, but if they are equal, accept parallel trends and use the interrupted time series estimate as the causal effect.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option incorrectly proposes to discard the control group and use an Interrupted Time Series (ITS) design on the treated group only. This ignores valuable information and relies on stronger, less plausible assumptions than a DiD design. Furthermore, it completely misunderstands the \"parallel trends\" assumption. It misinterprets it as a test for a flat pre-treatment trend *within the treated group* ($\\overline{Y}_{T,-2}=\\overline{Y}_{T,-1}$). The parallel trends assumption is about comparing the trend in the treated group to the trend in the control group.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4512394"}, {"introduction": "Effective community mobilization is not just about a program's overall outcome; it's also about the dynamics and sustainability of the partnerships that drive it.

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to calculate the Shapley value, which is a unique solution concept for such games. The language is objective and precise.

Shapley Value for Faith Leaders (FL)**\nWe sum the marginal contributions of FL to all coalitions not containing it.\n- Contribution to $\\emptyset$: $v(\\{\\mathrm{FL}\\}) - v(\\emptyset) = 3 - 0 = 3$.\n- Contribution to $\\{\\mathrm{CHW}\\}$: $v(\\{\\mathrm{CHW},\\mathrm{FL}\\}) - v(\\{\\mathrm{CHW}\\}) = 7 - 2 = 5$.\n- Contribution to $\\{\\mathrm{RB}\\}$: $v(\\{\\mathrm{FL},\\mathrm{RB}\\}) - v(\\{\\mathrm{RB}\\}) = 9 - 5 = 4$.\n- Contribution to $\\{\\mathrm{CHW},\\mathrm{RB}\\}$: $v(\\{\\mathrm{CHW},\\mathrm{FL},\\mathrm{RB}\\}) - v(\\{\\mathrm{CHW},\\mathrm{RB}\\}) = 20 - 10 = 10$.\n\nThe Shapley value for FL is:\n$$ \\phi_{\\mathrm{FL}}(v) = \\frac{1}{3}(3) + \\frac{1}{6}(5) + \\frac{1}{6}(4) + \\frac{1}{3}(10) = 1 + \\frac{5}{6} + \\frac{4}{6} + \\frac{10}{3} $$\n$$ \\phi_{\\mathrm{FL}}(v) = \\frac{6}{6} + \\frac{5}{6} + \\frac{4}{6} + \\frac{20}{6} = \\frac{6+5+4+20}{6} = \\frac{35}{6} $$\n\n**3. Shapley Value for Local Radio Broadcasters (RB)**\nWe sum the marginal contributions of RB to all coalitions not containing it.\n- Contribution to $\\emptyset$: $v(\\{\\mathrm{RB}\\}) - v(\\emptyset) = 5 - 0 = 5$.\n- Contribution to $\\{\\mathrm{CHW}\\}$: $v(\\{\\mathrm{CHW},\\mathrm{RB}\\}) - v(\\{\\mathrm{CHW}\\}) = 10 - 2 = 8$.\n- Contribution to $\\{\\mathrm{FL}\\}$: $v(\\{\\mathrm{FL},\\mathrm{RB}\\}) - v(\\{\\mathrm{FL}\\}) = 9 - 3 = 6$.\n- Contribution to $\\{\\mathrm{CHW},\\mathrm{FL}\\}$: $v(\\{\\mathrm{CHW},\\mathrm{FL},\\mathrm{RB}\\}) - v(\\{\\mathrm{CHW},\\mathrm{FL}\\}) = 20 - 7 = 13$.\n\nThe Shapley value for RB is:\n$$ \\phi_{\\mathrm{RB}}(v) = \\frac{1}{3}(5) + \\frac{1}{6}(8) + \\frac{1}{6}(6) + \\frac{1}{3}(13) = \\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{8}{6} + \\frac{6}{6} + \\frac{13}{3} $$\n$$ \\phi_{\\mathrm{RB}}(v) = \\frac{10}{6} + \\frac{8}{6} + \\frac{6}{6} + \\frac{26}{6} = \\frac{10+8+6+26}{6} = \\frac{50}{6} = \\frac{25}{3} $$\n\nThe final allocation is $(\\phi_{\\mathrm{CHW}}, \\phi_{\\mathrm{FL}}, \\phi_{\\mathrm{RB}}) = (\\frac{35}{6}, \\frac{35}{6}, \\frac{50}{6})$.\nAs a final check, the efficiency principle requires that the sum of the Shapley values equals the value of the grand coalition:\n$$ \\phi_{\\mathrm{CHW}}(v) + \\phi_{\\mathrm{FL}}(v) + \\phi_{\\mathrm{RB}}(v) = \\frac{35}{6} + \\frac{35}{6} + \\frac{50}{6} = \\frac{120}{6} = 20 $$\nThis matches the given value $v(\\{\\mathrm{CHW},\\mathrm{FL},\\mathrm{RB}\\})=20$, so the allocation is efficient.\n\n**Interpretation of Fairness Implications**\nThe Shapley value provides a principled, fair method for distributing the total success of the collaborative campaign ($20$ points) among the stakeholders.\n- The Radio Broadcasters (RB) receive the largest share ($\\frac{50}{6} \\approx 8.33$ points). This reflects their high standalone value ($v(\\{\\mathrm{RB}\\})=5$) and their crucial role in generating synergy, especially their large marginal contributions when joining larger coalitions (e.g., contributing $13$ points when joining $\\{\\mathrm{CHW},\\mathrm{FL}\\}$).\n- The Community Health Workers (CHW) and Faith Leaders (FL) receive equal shares ($\\frac{35}{6} \\approx 5.83$ points each). This is a non-trivial finding. While FLs have a higher standalone value ($3$ vs. $2$ for CHWs), the CHWs' capacity to create value in partnership (synergy) is, on average, higher. For instance, the pairwise synergy of $\\{\\mathrm{CHW},\\mathrm{RB}\\}$ is $10-5-2=3$, while for $\\{\\mathrm{FL},\\mathrm{RB}\\}$ it is $9-5-3=1$. The Shapley value correctly balances standalone contribution with synergistic potential across all possible coalition formations.\n- This result implies that a fair recognition or resource allocation strategy should not be based solely on a stakeholder's independent capacity but must account for their value as a collaborative partner. The analysis suggests CHW and FL are equally critical to the overall success when all interactions are considered, despite their differing initial contributions, and RB is the most critical partner. This provides a quantitative justification for equitable engagement and distribution of credit or resources in multi-stakeholder health initiatives.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{35}{6} & \\frac{35}{6} & \\frac{25}{3} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4512423"}]}
