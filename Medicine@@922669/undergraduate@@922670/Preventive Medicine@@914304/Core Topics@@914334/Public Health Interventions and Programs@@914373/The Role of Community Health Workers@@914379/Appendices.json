This first exercise places you in the role of a health district manager tasked with a fundamental question: how many Community Health Workers (CHWs) are needed to serve a population? By working through this scenario, you will learn to translate a desired coverage ratio into a practical staffing plan, accounting for real-world factors like absenteeism to ensure service continuity. [@problem_id:4764764]", "problem": "In the early years following the creation of the World Health Organization (WHO), planners developing Primary Health Care (PHC) systems aimed to achieve universal access by using population-to-provider ratios to guide staffing. Assume a district intends to meet a standard of one community health worker (CHW) per $1{,}000$ people to ensure continuous community-level access. The district has a stable population of $250{,}000$ people. However, due to training, illness, and leave, CHWs are not present at work all the time; over a year, the expected absenteeism rate is $0.10$ (expressed as a fraction of time not present).\n\nUsing only the following foundational principles:\n- By definition, the coverage goal requires that the effective number of CHWs available at any time must be sufficient to meet the service ratio (one CHW per $1{,}000$ people) for the entire population.\n- By definition, the effective workforce available at any given time equals the nominal number of CHWs multiplied by the fraction of time they are present (one minus the absenteeism rate).\n\nAssume CHW responsibilities are interchangeable and uniformly distributed, and that the district must guarantee the coverage standard at all times. Compute the minimum nominal number of CHWs the district must employ to meet the coverage goal under the stated absenteeism. Report your answer as the smallest whole number of CHWs that satisfies the requirement. Do not approximate; if a non-integer is obtained in intermediate steps, choose the smallest integer that still guarantees the standard is met.", "solution": "The objective is to compute the minimum nominal number of CHWs, denoted as $N_{nom}$, required to meet the district's health coverage standard.\n\nFirst, we determine the required number of *effective* CHWs, denoted as $N_{eff,req}$, that must be available at all times to serve the population. The population is $P = 250,000$, and the service ratio standard is one CHW for every $1,000$ people.\n\nThe required number of effective CHWs is calculated as:\n$$\nN_{eff,req} = \\frac{\\text{Total Population}}{\\text{People per CHW}} = \\frac{P}{1,000}\n$$\nSubstituting the given population value:\n$$\nN_{eff,req} = \\frac{250,000}{1,000} = 250\n$$\nTherefore, the district must ensure that at any given time, there is an effective workforce of $250$ CHWs on duty.\n\nNext, we account for the effect of absenteeism. The absenteeism rate is given as $A = 0.10$. According to the problem's second principle, the fraction of time a CHW is present is $(1 - A)$.\n$$\n\\text{Fraction of time present} = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90\n$$\nThe effective number of CHWs available, $N_{eff}$, is related to the total nominal number of CHWs employed, $N_{nom}$, by the following equation, also provided as a foundational principle:\n$$\nN_{eff} = N_{nom} \\times (1 - A)\n$$\nTo meet the coverage goal, the effective number of CHWs must be at least equal to the required effective number of CHWs. This establishes the inequality:\n$$\nN_{eff} \\ge N_{eff,req}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $N_{eff}$ and $N_{eff,req}$:\n$$\nN_{nom} \\times (1 - A) \\ge 250\n$$\nWe need to find the minimum $N_{nom}$ that satisfies this condition. We can solve for $N_{nom}$ by dividing both sides by $(1 - A)$:\n$$\nN_{nom} \\ge \\frac{250}{1 - A}\n$$\nSubstituting the value for $A$:\n$$\nN_{nom} \\ge \\frac{250}{1 - 0.10} = \\frac{250}{0.90}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\nN_{nom} \\ge 277.777...\n$$\nSince $N_{nom}$ represents the number of people employed, it must be an integer. The problem requires the *minimum nominal number* of CHWs that *guarantees* the standard is met. Therefore, we must choose the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to $277.777...$. This is achieved by taking the ceiling of the calculated value.\n$$\nN_{nom} = \\lceil 277.777... \\rceil = 278\n$$\nThus, the district must employ a nominal total of $278$ CHWs to ensure that, after accounting for a $10\\%$ absenteeism rate, the effective number of available CHWs is always at least $250$. We can verify this: if $N_{nom} = 278$, the effective number is $278 \\times 0.90 = 250.2$, which meets the requirement of being greater than or equal to $250$. If we were to choose $277$, the effective number would be $277 \\times 0.90 = 249.3$, which would fail to meet the coverage standard of $250$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{278}$$", "id": "4764764"}, {"introduction": "A CHW's effectiveness often depends on the tools they use, such as rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for diseases like malaria.
