The program standard is to ensure that health education materials are written at or below a reading grade level that matches the community’s median literacy, set as a threshold of $G_{\\text{target}} = 6.5$ grade levels, to reduce comprehension barriers across cultural and linguistic backgrounds.\n\nA pilot English section of the brochure was quantitatively analyzed using standard conventions for readability assessment. The following counts were obtained from the analyzed sample: number of sentences $S = 12$, total words $W = 180$, total syllables $Y = 260$, and number of polysyllabic words (words with three or more syllables) $P = 22$. Assume these counts were derived using validated procedures and that the analyzed sample is representative of the brochure’s language features.\n\nUsing widely accepted readability indices appropriate for health education materials, compute the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL) and the Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) grade for this sample.

The data ($S=12$, $W=180$, $Y=260$, $P=22$) are internally consistent and plausible for the described text sample. The task is to compute two standard readability metrics, determine their maximum, and compare this result against a specified threshold.\n\nThe primary objective is to assess the readability of a pilot health brochure section using two distinct formulas: the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL) and the Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) grade. The final assessment will be based on the maximum of these two computed values, which will then be compared to the target grade level of $G_{\\text{target}} = 6.5$.\n\nThe provided data are:\n- Number of sentences: $S = 12$\n- Total words: $W = 180$\n- Total syllables: $Y = 260$\n- Number of polysyllabic words (three or more syllables): $P = 22$\n\nFirst, we calculate the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL). The standard formula for FKGL is:\n$$FKGL = 0.39 \\left( \\frac{W}{S} \\right) + 11.8 \\left( \\frac{Y}{W} \\right) - 15.59$$\nWe compute the two ratios required for this formula:\nAverage words per sentence: $\\frac{W}{S} = \\frac{180}{12} = 15$\nAverage syllables per word: $\\frac{Y}{W} = \\frac{260}{180} = \\frac{13}{9}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the FKGL formula:\n$$FKGL = 0.39 \\left( 15 \\right) + 11.8 \\left( \\frac{13}{9} \\right) - 15.59$$\n$$FKGL = 5.85 + \\frac{153.4}{9} - 15.59$$\n$$FKGL \\approx 5.85 + 17.0444 - 15.59$$\n$$FKGL \\approx 7.3044$$\n\nNext, we calculate the SMOG grade. The SMOG formula requires the number of polysyllabic words, $P$, and the number of sentences, $S$. For a text sample of arbitrary sentence count, the formula is:\n$$SMOG = 1.0430 \\sqrt{P \\times \\frac{30}{S}} + 3.1291$$\nThe term $\\frac{30}{S}$ scales the polysyllable count to what would be expected in a standard $30$-sentence sample.

The material is written at a grade level substantially higher than the target.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the single number equal to the maximum of the two grade levels, rounded to three significant figures.\nThe maximum value is $10.8642...$.
