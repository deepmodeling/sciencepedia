It is scientifically grounded in established principles of epidemiology and preventive medicine, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objective in its formulation. The problem asks for the calculation and interpretation of standard epidemiological metrics from provided cohort data.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by first defining the fundamental quantities and then calculating the required metrics.\n\nLet $C_R$ and $N_R$ be the number of incident cases and the total number of individuals in Ethnic Group $R$, respectively. Similarly, let $C_S$ and $N_S$ be the corresponding values for Ethnic Group $S$.\nThe givens are:\n$C_R = 900$\n$N_R = 45,000$\n$C_S = 600$\n$N_S = 60,000$\nThe time horizon is $T = 10$ years.\nThe relative risk reduction from screening is $RRR = 0.25$.\n\nThe $10$-year cumulative incidence, or risk ($R$), for each group is calculated as the proportion of individuals who develop the disease over the specified time period.\nFor Group $R$, the baseline risk ($R_R$) is:\n$$R_R = \\frac{C_R}{N_R} = \\frac{900}{45,000} = \\frac{1}{50} = 0.02$$\nFor Group $S$, the baseline risk ($R_S$) is:\n$$R_S = \\frac{C_S}{N_S} = \\frac{600}{60,000} = \\frac{1}{100} = 0.01$$\n\nWith these baseline risks, we can compute the requested quantities.\n\n**1. Compute the $10$-year risk difference (RD)**\nThe risk difference is the absolute difference in risk between the two groups. It is defined as:\n$$RD = R_R - R_S$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$RD = 0.02 - 0.01 = 0.01$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the risk difference is $0.01000$.\n\n**2. Compute the $10$-year risk ratio (RR)**\nThe risk ratio is the ratio of the risk in Group $R$ to the risk in Group $S$. It is a relative measure of risk.\n$$RR = \\frac{R_R}{R_S}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$RR = \\frac{0.02}{0.01} = 2.0$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the risk ratio is $2.000$.\n\n**3. Compute the number needed to screen (NNS) in Group R**\nThe number needed to screen is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction ($ARR$) achieved by the screening program in a specific group.\nFirst, we must calculate the $ARR$ for Group $R$. The $ARR$ is the difference between the risk in the unscreened population and the risk in the screened population.\nThe risk in screened Group $R$ ($R_{R,screened}$) is the baseline risk reduced by the screening effect. The problem states the relative risk under screening is $0.75$ times the baseline risk, which is equivalent to a relative risk reduction ($RRR$) of $0.25$.\n$$R_{R,screened} = R_R \\times (1 - RRR) = R_R \\times 0.75 = 0.02 \\times 0.75 = 0.015$$\nThe absolute risk reduction in Group $R$ ($ARR_R$) is then:\n$$ARR_R = R_R - R_{R,screened} = 0.02 - 0.015 = 0.005$$\nAlternatively, $ARR$ can be calculated directly as:\n$$ARR_R = R_R \\times RRR = 0.02 \\times 0.25 = 0.005$$\nThe number needed to screen ($NNS$) is the reciprocal of the $ARR$:\n$$NNS_R = \\frac{1}{ARR_R}$$\nSubstituting the value for $ARR_R$:\n$$NNS_R = \\frac{1}{0.005} = 200$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the number needed to screen is $200.0$.\n\n**Brief Interpretation**\nThe results have significant practical implications for preventive policy, particularly concerning targeting and equity.\n\n- **Targeting and Efficiency**: The baseline risk of colorectal cancer in Group $R$ ($R_R=0.02$) is double that of Group $S$ ($R_S=0.01$), as indicated by the risk ratio of $2.000$. This higher baseline risk means that a screening intervention is more efficient when applied to Group $R$. This is quantitatively demonstrated by the number needed to screen. In Group $R$, one must screen $200.0$ individuals to prevent one case of cancer over $10$ years. For comparison, the NNS in Group $S$ would be $NNS_S = \\frac{1}{R_S \\times RRR} = \\frac{1}{0.01 \\times 0.25} = \\frac{1}{0.0025} = 400$. From a resource allocation perspective, a public health program would prevent twice as many cases for the same number of screenings by focusing on Group $R$. This supports a targeted strategy to maximize the health benefit of the screening program.\n\n- **Health Equity**: The initial disparity in risk ($RD = 0.01000$, $RR = 2.000$) reveals a significant health inequity between the two groups. Implementing a universal screening program with a constant relative risk reduction ($RRR=0.25$) will lower the incidence in both groups but will not eliminate the disparity. The relative risk between the groups remains unchanged post-screening ($RR_{screened} = \\frac{R_R \\times 0.75}{R_S \\times 0.75} = \\frac{R_R}{R_S} = 2.0$). The absolute risk difference is reduced ($RD_{screened} = (R_R - R_S) \\times 0.75 = 0.01 \\times 0.75 = 0.0075$), but a gap persists. A policy aiming for equity must address the root causes of the initial risk disparity or implement interventions that have a differentially greater effect in the higher-risk group, thereby narrowing the relative risk gap.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.01000 & 2.000 & 200.0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4567594"}, {"introduction": "Simple comparisons of health data between populations can be deceptive, a phenomenon dramatically illustrated by Simpson's Paradox.

It contains all necessary information to perform the requested epidemiological calculations.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in three parts as requested. All rates are expressed per $100,000$ person-years.\n\nPart 1: Crude Mortality Rates and Explanation\n\nThe crude mortality rate (CMR) is defined as the total number of deaths in a population over a specific period divided by the total number of person-years at risk in that population, typically multiplied by a constant (in this case, $100,000$).\nLet $D_i$ be the deaths and $N_i$ be the population in age stratum $i$. The total deaths are $D = \\sum_i D_i$ and the total population is $N = \\sum_i N_i$.\nThe CMR is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{CMR} = \\frac{\\sum_i D_i}{\\sum_i N_i} \\times 100,000 $$\n\nFor Group A:\nTotal population, $N_A = 90,000 \\text{ (ages } 20\\text{–}49) + 10,000 \\text{ (ages } 50+) = 100,000$.\nTotal deaths, $D_A = 180 \\text{ (ages } 20\\text{–}49) + 250 \\text{ (ages } 50+) = 430$.\nThe crude mortality rate for Group A is:\n$$ \\text{CMR}_A = \\frac{430}{100,000} \\times 100,000 = 430 \\text{ per } 100,000 \\text{ person-years} $$\n\nFor Group B:\nTotal population, $N_B = 20,000 \\text{ (ages } 20\\text{–}49) + 80,000 \\text{ (ages } 50+) = 100,000$.\nTotal deaths, $D_B = 30 \\text{ (ages } 20\\text{–}49) + 1,600 \\text{ (ages } 50+) = 1,630$.\nThe crude mortality rate for Group B is:\n$$ \\text{CMR}_B = \\frac{1,630}{100,000} \\times 100,000 = 1,630 \\text{ per } 100,000 \\text{ person-years} $$\n\nThe crude comparison, showing $\\text{CMR}_B$ to be nearly four times $\\text{CMR}_A$, is misleading because the two groups have vastly different age structures. Group A is predominantly young, with $\\frac{90,000}{100,000} = 90\\%$ of its members in the $20$–$49$ age stratum. Conversely, Group B is predominantly old, with $\\frac{80,000}{100,000} = 80\\%$ of its members in the $50+$ age stratum. Since mortality is strongly associated with age, this difference in age distribution acts as a confounding variable.\n\nTo demonstrate this confounding, we calculate the age-specific mortality rates (ASMR). The ASMR for a given age stratum $i$ is $\\text{ASMR}_i = \\frac{D_i}{N_i} \\times 100,000$.\n\nFor Group A:\n$\\text{ASMR}_{A, 20-49} = \\frac{180}{90,000} \\times 100,000 = 200$ per $100,000$ person-years.\n$\\text{ASMR}_{A, 50+} = \\frac{250}{10,000} \\times 100,000 = 2,500$ per $100,000$ person-years.\n\nFor Group B:\n$\\text{ASMR}_{B, 20-49} = \\frac{30}{20,000} \\times 100,000 = 150$ per $100,000$ person-years.\n$\\text{ASMR}_{B, 50+} = \\frac{1,600}{80,000} \\times 100,000 = 2,000$ per $100,000$ person-years.\n\nCrucially, within each age stratum, Group A has a *higher* mortality rate than Group B ($200 > 150$ and $2,500 > 2,000$). The crude rates suggest the opposite conclusion because Group B's population is heavily weighted toward the older, higher-mortality age group. This reversal of association is a classic example of Simpson's Paradox.\n\nPart 2: Directly Age-Standardized Mortality Rates\n\nDirect standardization addresses this confounding by calculating the mortality rate that would be observed in each group if they both had the same age structure as a common standard population. Let $m_i = D_i/N_i$ be the age-specific mortality proportion for stratum $i$ in a study group, and let $N_{S,i}$ be the population of stratum $i$ in the standard population. The number of expected deaths ($D_{\\text{exp}}$) in the standard population is the sum of the expected deaths in each stratum: $D_{\\text{exp}} = \\sum_i m_i \\cdot N_{S,i}$. The directly age-standardized mortality rate (DSMR) is:\n$$ \\text{DSMR} = \\frac{D_{\\text{exp}}}{\\sum_i N_{S,i}} \\times 100,000 $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the age-specific mortality proportions ($m_i$) for each group.\nFor Group A:\n$m_{A, 20-49} = \\frac{180}{90,000} = 0.002$\n$m_{A, 50+} = \\frac{250}{10,000} = 0.025$\n\nFor Group B:\n$m_{B, 20-49} = \\frac{30}{20,000} = 0.0015$\n$m_{B, 50+} = \\frac{1,600}{80,000} = 0.020$\n\nThe standard population ($N_S=100,000$) has $N_{S, 20-49} = 50,000$ and $N_{S, 50+} = 50,000$.\n\nTo find the DSMR for Group A, we calculate the expected deaths if Group A's rates occurred in the standard population:\n$D_{\\text{exp}, A} = (m_{A, 20-49} \\times N_{S, 20-49}) + (m_{A, 50+} \\times N_{S, 50+})$\n$D_{\\text{exp}, A} = (0.002 \\times 50,000) + (0.025 \\times 50,000) = 100 + 1,250 = 1,350$.\nThe DSMR for Group A is:\n$$ \\text{DSMR}_A = \\frac{1,350}{100,000} \\times 100,000 = 1,350 \\text{ per } 100,000 \\text{ person-years} $$\n\nTo find the DSMR for Group B, we calculate the expected deaths if Group B's rates occurred in the standard population:\n$D_{\\text{exp}, B} = (m_{B, 20-49} \\times N_{S, 20-49}) + (m_{B, 50+} \\times N_{S, 50+})$\n$D_{\\text{exp}, B} = (0.0015 \\times 50,000) + (0.020 \\times 50,000) = 75 + 1,000 = 1,075$.\nThe DSMR for Group B is:\n$$ \\text{DSMR}_B = \\frac{1,075}{100,000} \\times 100,000 = 1,075 \\text{ per } 100,000 \\text{ person-years} $$\nAfter adjusting for age, the mortality in Group A is higher than in Group B, consistent with the age-specific rates.\n\nPart 3: Age-Standardized Mortality Rate Ratio\n\nThe age-standardized mortality rate ratio (SMRR) of Group A to Group B is the ratio of their respective DSMRs.\n$$ \\text{SMRR}_{A:B} = \\frac{\\text{DSMR}_A}{\\text{DSMR}_B} $$\nUsing the computed values:\n$$ \\text{SMRR}_{A:B} = \\frac{1,350}{1,075} $$\nTo simplify the fraction:\n$$ \\frac{1,350}{1,075} = \\frac{270 \\times 5}{215 \\times 5} = \\frac{270}{215} = \\frac{54 \\times 5}{43 \\times 5} = \\frac{54}{43} $$\nAs a decimal, this is $1.25581395...$.

It reflects differences in the model coefficients—the intercepts and the \"returns\" to each covariate. In the context of race, ethnicity, and health, this **unexplained component is interpreted as a proxy for structural factors**, such as systemic racism. It quantifies the extent to which the two groups experience different outcomes even with the same measured characteristics. This could be due to unmeasured factors like chronic stress from discrimination, implicit bias in clinical encounters that affects treatment efficacy, or lower quality of care that isn't captured by the clinic quality index. Because the unexplained component ($0.2495$) is much larger than the explained component ($0.04600$), this analysis suggests that structural factors are the primary driver of the observed health disparity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.04600 & 0.2495 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4567539"}]}
