The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) posits that behavioral intention is determined jointly by three constructs: attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. In preventive medicine, when these constructs are measured on standardized scales in the unit interval and combined under an additive, linear multi-attribute utility framework that satisfies independence and monotonicity, the operational intention index is formed by aggregating each construct according to its empirical importance weight.\n\nGiven standardized assessments for a target individual of attitude $A=0.7$, subjective norm $\\mathrm{SN}=0.5$, and perceived behavioral control $\\mathrm{PBC}=0.6$, and empirically estimated importance weights $w_a=0.5$, $w_s=0.2$, and $w_p=0.3$, compute the individual’s intention index to exercise under the additive model described. Express your final result as a dimensionless decimal.\n\nThen, based on the computed value and the weights provided, explain which single construct offers the greatest marginal leverage for increasing the intention index and why, in terms of the additive model’s structure. Your final numeric answer should be the computed intention index; the interpretive component does not require a numeric response.", "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), a standard framework in health psychology and preventive medicine. The operationalization of the theory as a linear additive model is a well-established and mathematically consistent approach. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data for a unique solution without contradictions.\n\nThe problem states that the behavioral intention index, which we shall denote as $I$, is determined by an additive, linear aggregation of three constructs: attitude ($A$), subjective norm ($\\mathrm{SN}$), and perceived behavioral control ($\\mathrm{PBC}$). Each construct is multiplied by its corresponding empirical importance weight ($w_a$, $w_s$, $w_p$). This description formalizes to the following weighted sum model:\n$$\nI = w_a A + w_s \\mathrm{SN} + w_p \\mathrm{PBC}\n$$\n\nThe givens are:\n- Attitude score: $A=0.7$\n- Subjective norm score: $\\mathrm{SN}=0.5$\n- Perceived behavioral control score: $\\mathrm{PBC}=0.6$\n- Attitude weight: $w_a=0.5$\n- Subjective norm weight: $w_s=0.2$\n- Perceived behavioral control weight: $w_p=0.3$\n\nIt is noted that the scores are standardized on the unit interval, which is consistent with the provided values $0.7$, $0.5$, and $0.6$. The weights are positive and sum to unity: $w_a + w_s + w_p = 0.5 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 1.0$, which is characteristic of importance weights in a properly constituted linear multi-attribute utility model.\n\nTo compute the individual's intention index $I$, we substitute the given values into the model equation:\n$$\nI = (0.5)(0.7) + (0.2)(0.5) + (0.3)(0.6)\n$$\n\nPerforming the multiplication for each term:\n$$\nI = 0.35 + 0.10 + 0.18\n$$\n\nSumming the terms yields the final value for the intention index:\n$$\nI = 0.63\n$$\n\nThe second part of the problem asks to identify which single construct offers the greatest marginal leverage for increasing the intention index. In the context of the given linear model, \"marginal leverage\" corresponds to the rate of change of the intention index $I$ with respect to a change in one of the constructs, holding the others constant. This is mathematically represented by the partial derivative of $I$ with respect to each construct.\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives:\n1.  The marginal leverage of attitude ($A$) is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial A} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial A}(w_a A + w_s \\mathrm{SN} + w_p \\mathrm{PBC}) = w_a\n    $$\n2.  The marginal leverage of subjective norm ($\\mathrm{SN}$) is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial \\mathrm{SN}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathrm{SN}}(w_a A + w_s \\mathrm{SN} + w_p \\mathrm{PBC}) = w_s\n    $$\n3.  The marginal leverage of perceived behavioral control ($\\mathrm{PBC}$) is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial \\mathrm{PBC}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathrm{PBC}}(w_a A + w_s \\mathrm{SN} + w_p \\mathrm{PBC}) = w_p\n    $$\n\nFrom the structure of this additive model, the marginal impact of each construct on the intention index is precisely its importance weight. To determine which construct offers the greatest leverage, we compare the values of these weights:\n- $w_a = 0.5$\n- $w_s = 0.2$\n- $w_p = 0.3$\n\nComparing these values, we find that $w_a  w_p  w_s$. The weight for attitude, $w_a=0.5$, is the largest. Therefore, attitude ($A$) offers the greatest marginal leverage. This means that for a given unit increase in any single construct's score (assuming the score is not already at its maximum of $1$), an increase in attitude will produce the largest corresponding increase in the intention index ($I$). Specifically, a $0.1$ point increase in attitude score would increase the intention index by $0.1 \\times 0.5 = 0.05$, whereas the same increase in perceived behavioral control would raise the index by only $0.1 \\times 0.3 = 0.03$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.63}$$", "id": "4562952"}, {"introduction": "Once an intervention is implemented, we must rigorously measure and communicate its impact. However, the language of risk can be tricky; a \"$25\\%$ reduction in risk\" can mean very different things depending on the population. This practice [@problem_id:4562962] delves into the critical distinction between relative risk and absolute risk reduction, showing how the same intervention can have vastly different practical implications for low-risk versus high-risk groups. Mastering this concept is essential for accurately interpreting trial results and communicating health benefits transparently to both the public and policymakers.", "problem": "A city health department runs a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a year-long text-message physical activity program to promote brisk walking. Adults with sedentary lifestyles are randomized to the intervention or usual care and followed for $1$ year. The primary outcome is the $1$-year incidence of hospitalization for any cardiovascular cause. Investigators also predefine a high-risk subgroup based on elevated baseline blood pressure and fasting glucose.\n\nOverall population results:\n- Intervention group: $n = 5{,}000$; cardiovascular hospitalizations over $1$ year: $150$.\n- Control group: $n = 5{,}000$; cardiovascular hospitalizations over $1$ year: $200$.\n\nHigh-risk subgroup (a subset of the above):\n- Intervention subgroup: $n = 500$; hospitalizations: $150$.\n- Control subgroup: $n = 500$; hospitalizations: $200$.\n\nUsing only the core epidemiologic definitions that risk is the probability of an event over a specified time, relative risk is a comparison of probabilities between exposed and unexposed, and risk difference is a comparison on an absolute scale, determine which option correctly states:\n(i) what absolute risk, relative risk, and risk difference are in conceptual terms,\n(ii) what the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is and how it should be interpreted over the $1$-year horizon, and\n(iii) why communicating only relative risk can mislead in health promotion messaging in this scenario.\n\nChoose the single best option.\n\nA. Absolute risk is the probability of hospitalization over $1$ year within each group; relative risk compares those probabilities as a ratio; risk difference compares them as a subtraction on the absolute scale. In the overall population, the control risk is $200/5{,}000 = 4\\%$ and the intervention risk is $150/5{,}000 = 3\\%$, so the relative risk is approximately $0.75$ and the absolute risk difference is approximately $1$ percentage point. In the high-risk subgroup, the control risk is $200/500 = 40\\%$ and the intervention risk is $150/500 = 30\\%$, so the relative risk is again approximately $0.75$ but the absolute risk difference is approximately $10$ percentage points. The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is the number of people who would need the intervention for $1$ year for one additional person to avoid hospitalization in that period; it is about $100$ in the overall population and about $10$ in the high-risk subgroup. Reporting only a “$25\\%$ relative reduction” can mislead because it conceals the baseline risk and therefore the absolute benefit, which differs markedly between these groups.\n\nB. Absolute risk is the probability of hospitalization; risk difference is the ratio of those probabilities; relative risk is the subtraction on an absolute scale. Because the intervention yields a $25\\%$ relative reduction, the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is $4$ in both the overall and high-risk groups. Relative risk alone is sufficient for communication because it does not change with baseline risk and therefore fully captures benefit.\n\nC. Absolute risk is the same as the odds of hospitalization; relative risk is best estimated using the odds ratio when events are uncommon; risk difference is unnecessary. In the overall population, the relative risk is about $0.75$, but in the high-risk subgroup it is about $0.50$ because the baseline risk is higher. The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) in the high-risk subgroup is about $3$. Relative risk should be preferred in communication because absolute risk depends on sample size and therefore is unstable.\n\nD. Absolute risk and relative risk are interchangeable descriptions of the same quantity; risk difference is only meaningful for rare outcomes. The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) equals the reciprocal of the event rate in the intervention group, so it is $1/0.03 \\approx 33$ in the overall population and $1/0.30 \\approx 3$ in the high-risk subgroup. Relative risk does not need baseline risks to be interpreted and therefore is the most ethical single message to avoid confusing audiences.", "solution": "We begin from core definitions in epidemiology and preventive medicine. Risk is defined as a probability over a specified time: for a group of size $N$ followed for a fixed time, absolute risk equals $E/N$, where $E$ is the number of events observed in that time. Relative risk is the comparison of probabilities between two groups as a ratio: the probability in the exposed (intervention) group divided by the probability in the unexposed (control) group. Risk difference is the comparison on an absolute scale: the probability in the exposed group minus the probability in the unexposed group. The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is an interpretation tool derived from the absolute risk reduction over a given time frame; it is the number of individuals who would need the intervention for that time to prevent one additional event compared with control. It is interpreted over the specified horizon and depends on baseline risk.\n\nCompute the quantities from the data.\n\nOverall population:\n- Control absolute risk over $1$ year: $200/5{,}000 = 0.04 = 4\\%$.\n- Intervention absolute risk over $1$ year: $150/5{,}000 = 0.03 = 3\\%$.\n- Relative risk (intervention versus control): $0.03/0.04 = 0.75$.\n- Risk difference (intervention minus control): $0.03 - 0.04 = -0.01$, corresponding to an absolute risk reduction of $0.01 = 1$ percentage point.\n- Number Needed to Treat (NNT) over $1$ year: interpretationally, the number of people who would need the program for $1$ year to prevent one additional hospitalization. Based on an absolute risk reduction of $0.01$, this is about $1/0.01 = 100$ persons.\n\nHigh-risk subgroup:\n- Control absolute risk: $200/500 = 0.40 = 40\\%$.\n- Intervention absolute risk: $150/500 = 0.30 = 30\\%$.\n- Relative risk: $0.30/0.40 = 0.75$ (same ratio as in the overall population).\n- Risk difference: $0.30 - 0.40 = -0.10$, an absolute risk reduction of $0.10 = 10$ percentage points.\n- NNT over $1$ year: about $1/0.10 = 10$ persons.\n\nPrinciple-based interpretation for communication: Relative risk by itself does not convey baseline (absolute) risk. The same relative risk of $0.75$ corresponds to very different absolute benefits when baseline risks differ (here, a $1$ percentage point reduction versus a $10$ percentage point reduction). In health promotion, relying solely on relative risk (for example, saying “$25\\%$ reduction”) can overstate the practical impact when baseline risk is low or understate it when baseline risk is high, potentially misleading individuals and policy makers. Transparent communication should include absolute metrics such as absolute risk, risk difference, and NNT over a clearly specified time horizon to support informed decisions.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\n- Option A: This option correctly defines absolute risk as a probability within each group over the specified time, relative risk as a ratio of probabilities, and risk difference as a subtraction on the absolute scale. It reports the overall control risk $4\\%$ and intervention risk $3\\%$, yielding relative risk approximately $0.75$ and an absolute risk difference of about $1$ percentage point; and in the high-risk subgroup, $40\\%$ versus $30\\%$ with the same relative risk but a $10$ percentage point absolute difference. It interprets the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) correctly as the number of people treated for $1$ year to prevent one event, with values about $100$ overall and $10$ in the high-risk subgroup. Finally, it accurately explains why reporting only relative risk can mislead by obscuring baseline risk and absolute benefit. Verdict: Correct.\n\n- Option B: This reverses the concepts of relative risk and risk difference, incorrectly defining risk difference as a ratio and relative risk as a subtraction. It also asserts the NNT is $4$ everywhere by confusing the reciprocal of the relative risk reduction ($25\\%$) with the absolute risk reduction in the overall sample, where the absolute reduction is $1\\%$ and the correct NNT is about $100$. It claims relative risk alone is sufficient, which contradicts the demonstrated variation in absolute benefit across baseline risks. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- Option C: It equates absolute risk with odds, which is wrong. It also claims that in the high-risk subgroup the relative risk is about $0.50$, but the data show the ratio $0.30/0.40 = 0.75$, not $0.50$. The proposed NNT of about $3$ for the high-risk subgroup is inconsistent with the $10$ percentage point absolute reduction (which implies an NNT of about $10$). Finally, it argues that absolute risk depends on sample size; absolute risk is a probability and does not inherently depend on the sample size, though its precision does. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- Option D: It asserts absolute and relative risk are interchangeable, which is false. It defines NNT as the reciprocal of the intervention event rate rather than the absolute risk reduction, leading to incorrect values ($\\approx 33$ and $\\approx 3$). It also endorses relative risk as sufficient without baseline risks, ignoring the dependence of practical benefit on baseline risk.

In preventive medicine, a core principle of health promotion is to prioritize interventions that yield the greatest health gain per unit of resource expended. Under a payer perspective and a one-year time horizon, the department estimates the expected per-participant cost and the expected per-participant health gain, measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), for two strategies: the new counseling program and current practice (brief advice with referral). The expected costs are $C_1$ for the counseling program and $C_0$ for current practice, and the expected health gains are $E_1$ and $E_0$, respectively. The fundamental definitions for cost-effectiveness require that incremental quantities be computed as differences between the intervention and the comparator: incremental cost is the change in expected cost attributable to choosing the intervention over the comparator, and incremental effect is the change in expected QALYs attributable to that choice. The ratio of these incremental quantities represents the resources required to obtain one additional unit of health gain and is the basis for determining whether the intervention is efficient relative to a specified willingness-to-pay threshold for health gains.\n\nUse the following data, which are scientifically plausible for a one-year program in this setting: $C_1$ is $1{,}200$ United States dollars (USD), $C_0$ is $800$ USD, $E_1$ is $0.05$ QALYs, and $E_0$ is $0.02$ QALYs.
