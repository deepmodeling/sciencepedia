To quantify the potential impact of a sodium-reduction policy, the department wants to estimate the population attributable fraction (PAF) of hypertension due to high sodium intake.\n\nAssume a closed, stable adult population where the prevalence of high sodium intake is $P_e = 0.35$. A recent high-quality meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies estimates the relative risk (RR) of incident hypertension associated with high sodium intake as $RR = 1.4$.

The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The simplifying assumptions, such as the absence of confounding, are explicitly stated, rendering the problem solvable within the given framework.\n\nLet $I_e$ be the incidence of hypertension in the subpopulation with high sodium intake (the exposed group).\nLet $I_u$ be the incidence of hypertension in the subpopulation with normal sodium intake (the unexposed group).\nLet $P_e$ be the prevalence of high sodium intake in the total population, which is given as $P_e = 0.35$.\nThe proportion of the population that is unexposed is therefore $1 - P_e$.\n\nThe total incidence of hypertension in the population, $I_{pop}$, is the weighted average of the incidences in the exposed and unexposed subgroups:\n$$I_{pop} = (I_e \\cdot P_e) + (I_u \\cdot (1 - P_e))$$\n\nThe relative risk, $RR$, is defined as the ratio of the incidence in the exposed group to the incidence in the unexposed group:\n$$RR = \\frac{I_e}{I_u}$$\nThis is given as $RR = 1.4$. From this definition, we can express $I_e$ in terms of $I_u$ and $RR$:\n$$I_e = RR \\cdot I_u$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $I_e$ into the equation for $I_{pop}$:\n$$I_{pop} = (RR \\cdot I_u \\cdot P_e) + (I_u \\cdot (1 - P_e))$$\nWe can factor out $I_u$:\n$$I_{pop} = I_u \\left( RR \\cdot P_e + 1 - P_e \\right)$$\n\nThe population attributable fraction (PAF) is defined as the proportion of disease incidence in the total population that would be avoided if the exposure were eliminated. If the exposure (high sodium intake) were eliminated, the entire population would experience the risk of the unexposed group, so the new total population incidence would be $I_u$.\n\nThe total number of cases attributable to the exposure is the current total incidence minus the incidence that would remain if the exposure were eliminated, which is $I_{pop} - I_u$. The PAF is this quantity expressed as a fraction of the total population incidence:\n$$PAF = \\frac{I_{pop} - I_u}{I_{pop}}$$\n\nWe can also express this as:\n$$PAF = 1 - \\frac{I_u}{I_{pop}}$$\n\nUsing our expression for $I_{pop}$ in terms of $I_u$, we can substitute it into the denominator:\n$$PAF = 1 - \\frac{I_u}{I_u \\left( RR \\cdot P_e + 1 - P_e \\right)}$$\n\nAssuming $I_u \\neq 0$ (which must be true for the problem to be meaningful), we can cancel the $I_u$ term:\n$$ PAF = 1 - \\frac{1}{RR \\cdot P_e + 1 - P_e} $$\nTo combine the terms, we find a common denominator:\n$$ PAF = \\frac{(RR \\cdot P_e + 1 - P_e) - 1}{RR \\cdot P_e + 1 - P_e} $$\n$$ PAF = \\frac{RR \\cdot P_e - P_e}{RR \\cdot P_e + 1 - P_e} $$\nFactoring out $P_e$ in the numerator gives the final derived expression for PAF in terms of $P_e$ and $RR$:\n$$ PAF = \\frac{P_e (RR - 1)}{1 + P_e (RR - 1)} $$\nThis is a standard and widely used formula for the population attributable fraction.\n\nNow, we compute the value of PAF using the given parameters: $P_e = 0.35$ and $RR = 1.4$.\n$$ PAF = \\frac{0.35 (1.4 - 1)}{1 + 0.35 (1.4 - 1)} $$\nFirst, calculate the term $(RR - 1)$:\n$$ 1.4 - 1 = 0.4 $$\nNow substitute this back into the expression:\n$$ PAF = \\frac{0.35 \\cdot 0.4}{1 + (0.35 \\cdot 0.4)} $$\nCalculate the product in the numerator and denominator:\n$$ 0.35 \\cdot 0.4 = 0.14 $$\nSo the expression becomes:\n$$ PAF = \\frac{0.14}{1 + 0.14} = \\frac{0.14}{1.14} $$\nPerforming the final division:\n$$ PAF \\approx 0.1228070175... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.
