It is based on a foundational episode in the history of epidemiology and uses standard, well-defined metrics. All data required for the calculations are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is therefore deemed valid, and a solution is presented forthwith.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of three fundamental epidemiologic measures of association and impact: the risk difference, the risk ratio, and the population attributable fraction. We are given data for two populations: an exposed group receiving contaminated water from the Southwark and Vauxhall (SV) company, and an unexposed group receiving cleaner water from the Lambeth (L) company.\n\nLet $N_{SV}$ be the number of residents served by Southwark and Vauxhall, and $D_{SV}$ be the number of cholera deaths in that group.\nLet $N_{L}$ be the number of residents served by Lambeth, and $D_{L}$ be the number of cholera deaths in that group.\n\nThe given data are:\n- Exposed group (SV): $N_{SV} = 40,000$, $D_{SV} = 1,000$.\n- Unexposed group (L): $N_{L} = 30,000$, $D_{L} = 100$.\n\nThe risk, or incidence proportion, is the number of new cases (deaths) in a specified period divided by the number of individuals at risk at the beginning of that period.\n\nThe risk in the exposed group, $R_{E}$, is the risk among those served by Southwark and Vauxhall:\n$$R_{E} = \\frac{D_{SV}}{N_{SV}} = \\frac{1,000}{40,000} = \\frac{1}{40}$$\n\nThe risk in the unexposed group, $R_{U}$, is the risk among those served by Lambeth:\n$$R_{U} = \\frac{D_{L}}{N_{L}} = \\frac{100}{30,000} = \\frac{1}{300}$$\n\nWith these fundamental quantities calculated, we can now compute the three requested measures.\n\n1.  **Risk Difference (RD)**\n    The risk difference, also known as the attributable risk, is the absolute difference in risk between the exposed and unexposed groups. It quantifies the excess risk of the outcome (death) that is attributable to the exposure.\n    $$RD = R_{E} - R_{U}$$\n    Substituting the calculated risks:\n    $$RD = \\frac{1}{40} - \\frac{1}{300}$$\n    To subtract the fractions, we find a common denominator, which is the least common multiple of $40$ and $300$. The $LCM(40, 300) = 600$.\n    $$RD = \\frac{15}{600} - \\frac{2}{600} = \\frac{13}{600}$$\n    The risk difference is $\\frac{13}{600}$.\n\n2.  **Risk Ratio (RR)**\n    The risk ratio, also known as the relative risk, is the ratio of the risk in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group. It quantifies the strength of the association between the exposure and the outcome.\n    $$RR = \\frac{R_{E}}{R_{U}}$$\n    Substituting the calculated risks:\n    $$RR = \\frac{\\frac{1}{40}}{\\frac{1}{300}} = \\frac{300}{40} = \\frac{30}{4} = \\frac{15}{2}$$\n    The risk ratio is $\\frac{15}{2}$.\n\n3.  **Population Attributable Fraction (PAF)**\n    The population attributable fraction is the proportion of new cases in the total population that can be attributed to the exposure. It is calculated using the total population risk ($R_{T}$) and the risk in the unexposed group ($R_{U}$).\n    $$PAF = \\frac{R_{T} - R_{U}}{R_{T}}$$\n    First, we must calculate the total population risk, $R_{T}$. The total population is $N_{T} = N_{SV} + N_{L} = 40,000 + 30,000 = 70,000$. The total number of deaths is $D_{T} = D_{SV} + D_{L} = 1,000 + 100 = 1,100$.\n    The total population risk is therefore:\n    $$R_{T} = \\frac{D_{T}}{N_{T}} = \\frac{1,100}{70,000} = \\frac{11}{700}$$\n    Now we can calculate the PAF:\n    $$PAF = \\frac{\\frac{11}{700} - \\frac{1}{300}}{\\frac{11}{700}}$$\n    First, we calculate the numerator: $\\frac{11}{700} - \\frac{1}{300}$. The common denominator is $LCM(700, 300) = 2,100$.\n    $$\\frac{11 \\times 3}{2,100} - \\frac{1 \\times 7}{2,100} = \\frac{33 - 7}{2,100} = \\frac{26}{2,100} = \\frac{13}{1,050}$$\n    Now, we complete the PAF calculation:\n    $$PAF = \\frac{\\frac{13}{1,050}}{\\frac{11}{700}} = \\frac{13}{1,050} \\times \\frac{700}{11} = \\frac{13 \\times 700}{1,050 \\times 11}$$\n    Simplifying the fraction:\n    $$PAF = \\frac{13 \\times 70}{105 \\times 11} = \\frac{13 \\times (35 \\times 2)}{(35 \\times 3) \\times 11} = \\frac{13 \\times 2}{3 \\times 11} = \\frac{26}{33}$$\n    The population attributable fraction is $\\frac{26}{33}$.\n\nThe three requested values are the risk difference of $\\frac{13}{600}$, the risk ratio of $\\frac{15}{2}$, and the population attributable fraction of $\\frac{26}{33}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{13}{600} & \\frac{15}{2} & \\frac{26}{33} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4537559"}, {"introduction": "Comparing death rates between two towns, or even the same town over time, can be misleading if their age structures are different.

Age-Specific Death Rates (ASDRs)**\nThe ASDR for each age group $i$, denoted $\\text{ASDR}_{i}$, is the number of deaths in that group per $1,000$ persons in the same group.\n$$\\text{ASDR}_{i} = \\frac{d_{i}}{n_{i}} \\times 1000$$\n- For ages $0$–$4$: $\\text{ASDR}_{1} = \\frac{20}{120} \\times 1000 = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 1000 \\approx 166.67$ per $1000$.\n- For ages $5$–$14$: $\\text{ASDR}_{2} = \\frac{4}{260} \\times 1000 = \\frac{1}{65} \\times 1000 \\approx 15.38$ per $1000$.\n- For ages $15$–$44$: $\\text{ASDR}_{3} = \\frac{9}{420} \\times 1000 = \\frac{3}{140} \\times 1000 \\approx 21.43$ per $1000$.\n- For ages $45$–$64$: $\\text{ASDR}_{4} = \\frac{12}{180} \\times 1000 = \\frac{1}{15} \\times 1000 \\approx 66.67$ per $1000$.\n- For ages $\\geq 65$: $\\text{ASDR}_{5} = \\frac{14}{70} \\times 1000 = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 1000 = 200$ per $1000$.\n\n**4. Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR)**\nThe SMR is calculated using indirect standardization.

It represents a standard analysis of a randomized controlled trial with non-adherence. All necessary information is provided, and the assumptions, while simplifying, are explicitly stated and standard for such problems.

The total risk in the vaccine-assigned arm is the weighted average:\n$$ R_{ITT, V} = (1 - c_V) R_V + c_V R_U $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $R_V$ and $R_U$:\n$$ R_{ITT, V} = (0.80)(0.30 r) + (0.20)(r) = 0.24 r + 0.20 r = 0.44 r $$\n\nNext, we determine the overall risk in the control-assigned arm, $R_{ITT, C}$.
