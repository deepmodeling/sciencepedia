A single-dose vaccine is available with efficacy at preventing infection ($E$), where $E \\in (0,1]$; that is, vaccination reduces an individual’s susceptibility to infection by the fraction $E$ relative to an unvaccinated person.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of infectious disease epidemiology, is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe task is to first define herd immunity in terms of the effective reproduction number, $R_e$, and then to derive the minimal vaccination coverage, $p_c$, required to achieve it.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental definitions. The basic reproduction number, $R_0$, represents the average number of new infections generated by a single infectious individual in a population where every single person is susceptible. The effective reproduction number, $R_e$, is the analogous quantity in a population where not everyone is susceptible. Under the assumption of homogeneous mixing, the relationship between these two numbers is a direct proportionality, mediated by the fraction of the population that remains susceptible, denoted by $s$:\n$$R_e = R_0 \\cdot s$$\n\nHerd immunity is the state in which the spread of an infectious disease is contained because a sufficiently high proportion of the population is immune. The epidemiological condition for this state is that the number of infected individuals must be declining over time. This occurs when, on average, each infectious person gives rise to fewer than one new infection. Therefore, the precise definition of herd immunity in terms of the effective reproduction number is the condition that $R_e < 1$. The critical threshold for achieving herd immunity is the point at which the effective reproduction number is exactly unity:\n$$R_e = 1$$\n\nTo derive the critical vaccination coverage, $p_c$, we must first determine the susceptible fraction of the population, $s$, as a function of vaccination coverage, $p$, and vaccine efficacy, $E$.\n\nLet the total population be of size $N$.\nThe fraction of the population that is vaccinated is $p$. Thus, the number of vaccinated individuals is $p N$.\nThe fraction of the population that is unvaccinated is $1-p$. The number of unvaccinated individuals is $(1-p)N$.\n\nThe vaccine efficacy, $E$, is the fraction of vaccinated individuals who are successfully protected from infection. These individuals are no longer susceptible. The number of successfully vaccinated and protected individuals is $E \\cdot (p N) = E p N$.\n\nA fraction $1-E$ of vaccinated individuals are not protected by the vaccine (vaccine failure) and thus remain susceptible to the infection. The number of such individuals is $(1-E) \\cdot (p N) = (1-E) p N$.\n\nGiven the problem's assumption of negligible pre-existing immunity, all unvaccinated individuals are susceptible. Their number is $(1-p)N$.\n\nThe total number of susceptible individuals in the population is the sum of the unvaccinated individuals and the vaccinated-but-unprotected individuals:\n$$\\text{Number susceptible} = (1-p)N + (1-E)pN$$\n\nThe fraction of the population that is susceptible, $s$, is this number divided by the total population, $N$:\n$$s = \\frac{(1-p)N + (1-E)pN}{N}$$\n$$s = (1-p) + p(1-E)$$\n$$s = 1 - p + p - pE$$\n$$s = 1 - pE$$\n\nNow we combine our findings. The effective reproduction number is $R_e = R_0 \\cdot s$. Substituting our expression for $s$:\n$$R_e = R_0 (1 - pE)$$\n\nThe herd immunity threshold is achieved when $R_e = 1$. Let $p_c$ be the minimal vaccination coverage required to reach this threshold. We set $R_e = 1$ and $p = p_c$:\n$$1 = R_0 (1 - p_c E)$$\n\nWe now solve this equation for $p_c$. We assume $R_0 > 1$, as a disease with $R_0 \\le 1$ would not persist in the population even without any vaccination, making the question of vaccination coverage for herd immunity moot (the required coverage would be $0$).\n$$\\frac{1}{R_0} = 1 - p_c E$$\n$$p_c E = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\n$$p_c E = \\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0}$$\n$$p_c = \\frac{1}{E} \\left( \\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0} \\right)$$\n\nThis expression gives the minimal vaccination coverage, $p_c$, required to bring the effective reproduction number to $1$ and thus achieve the herd immunity threshold. For any coverage $p > p_c$, the effective reproduction number will be $R_e < 1$, and the disease incidence will decline.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{R_0 - 1}{E R_0}}$$", "id": "4516366"}, {"introduction": "Public health practice culminates in making difficult strategic decisions under real-world constraints.

A complete solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe stated problem is to select a subset of interventions that maximizes the total expected Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) averted per year, subject to a total budget constraint. This is a classic 0/1 knapsack problem, where each intervention $i$ is an item with a \"cost\" $C_i$ and a \"value\" (or benefit) $E_i$. We wish to maximize the total value of items in the knapsack, $\\sum_i E_i x_i$, without exceeding the knapsack's capacity, $\\sum_i C_i x_i \\le B$.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the expected annual DALYs averted, $E_i$, for each intervention using the formula $E_i = N_i r_i c_i v_i \\Delta_i$.\n\nFor Intervention A:\n$\\Delta_A = w_A \\times \\frac{d_A}{365} = 0.20 \\times \\frac{7}{365} = \\frac{1.4}{365}$.\n$E_A = (50,000)(0.08)(0.50)(0.60)(\\frac{1.4}{365}) = (1200)(\\frac{1.4}{365}) = \\frac{1680}{365} = \\frac{336}{73}$.\n\nFor Intervention B:\n$E_B = (20,000)(0.01)(0.30)(0.30)(5) = (200)(0.09)(5) = 18 \\times 5 = 90$.\n\nFor Intervention C:\n$\\Delta_C = w_C \\times \\frac{d_C}{365} = 0.20 \\times \\frac{14}{365} = \\frac{2.8}{365}$.\n$E_C = (10,000)(0.02)(0.90)(0.95)(\\frac{2.8}{365}) = (171)(\\frac{2.8}{365}) = \\frac{478.8}{365} = \\frac{4788}{3650} = \\frac{2394}{1825}$.\n\nFor Intervention D:\n$E_D = (40,000)(0.005)(0.25)(0.60)(0.33) = (200)(0.15)(0.33) = 30 \\times 0.33 = 9.9$.\n\nFor Intervention E:\n$E_E = (5,000)(0.01)(0.40)(0.50)(3) = (50)(0.2)(3) = 10 \\times 3 = 30$.\n\nFor Intervention F:\n$E_F = (2,000)(0.002)(1.00)(0.50)(2) = (4)(1.0)(1.0) = 4$.\n\nNow we tabulate the costs ($C_i$) and the calculated benefits ($E_i$) for each intervention:\n\n| Intervention ($i$) | Cost ($C_i$) | Benefit ($E_i$) |\n|:---:|:---:|:---|\n| A | $300,000$ | $\\frac{336}{73} \\approx 4.60$ |\n| B | $450,000$ | $90$ |\n| C | $200,000$ | $\\frac{2394}{1825} \\approx 1.31$ |\n| D | $280,000$ | $9.9$ |\n| E | $220,000$ | $30$ |\n| F | $150,000$ | $4$ |\n\nThe total budget is $B = 900,000$. Since the number of interventions is small ($n=6$), we can find the optimal solution by systematically exploring combinations of interventions that fit within the budget.\n\nThe benefit of intervention B, $E_B = 90$, is substantially higher than that of any other intervention. The sum of the benefits of all other interventions is $E_A + E_C + E_D + E_E + E_F \\approx 4.60 + 1.31 + 9.9 + 30 + 4 = 49.81$. Since this sum is less than $E_B$, any optimal solution must include intervention B.\n\nAssuming we select intervention B, the remaining budget is $B' = 900,000 - C_B = 900,000 - 450,000 = 450,000$. The problem reduces to selecting a combination of the remaining interventions {A, C, D, E, F} that maximizes DALYs averted within this remaining budget of $450,000$.\n\nLet's analyze the remaining options:\n- Item A: Cost $300,000$, Benefit $\\approx 4.60$\n- Item C: Cost $200,000$, Benefit $\\approx 1.31$\n- Item D: Cost $280,000$, Benefit $9.9$\n- Item E: Cost $220,000$, Benefit $30$\n- Item F: Cost $150,000$, Benefit $4$\n\nWe can apply a greedy approach based on benefit-to-cost ratio, or simply test combinations for this smaller problem.\nLet's consider combinations of the remaining items that fit within the $450,000$ budget:\n1.  Select {E, F}: Total cost $C_E + C_F = 220,000 + 150,000 = 370,000 \\le 450,000$. Total benefit $E_E + E_F = 30 + 4 = 34$.\n2.  Select {E, C}: Total cost $C_E + C_C = 220,000 + 200,000 = 420,000 \\le 450,000$. Total benefit $E_E + E_C = 30 + \\frac{2394}{1825} \\approx 31.31$.\n3.  Select {A, F}: Total cost $C_A + C_F = 300,000 + 150,000 = 450,000 \\le 450,000$. Total benefit $E_A + E_F = \\frac{336}{73} + 4 \\approx 8.60$.\n4.  Select {D, F}: Total cost $C_D + C_F = 280,000 + 150,000 = 430,000 \\le 450,000$. Total benefit $E_D + E_F = 9.9 + 4 = 13.9$.\n5.  Select {E} only: Cost $220,000$, Benefit $30$.\n6.  Select {A} only: Cost $300,000$, Benefit $\\approx 4.60$.\n7.  Any combination of three or more items from {A, C, D, E, F} will exceed the remaining budget of $450,000$. For example, the three cheapest are C, F, E with total cost $200,000+150,000+220,000=570,000 > 450,000$.\n\nComparing the benefits from these valid combinations, the set {E, F} provides the highest additional benefit ($34$).\n\nTherefore, the optimal set of interventions is {B, E, F}.\nLet's verify the total cost and total benefit for this combination:\n- Total Cost: $C_B + C_E + C_F = 450,000 + 220,000 + 150,000 = 820,000$. This is within the budget of $900,000$.\n- Total Expected DALYs Averted: $E_{total} = E_B + E_E + E_F = 90 + 30 + 4 = 124$.\n\nThis value, $124$, is the maximum expected total DALYs that can be averted given the budget constraint.\n\nFinal check of other top combinations from the full set:\n- {B, E, C}: Cost $870,000$. Benefit $90 + 30 + \\frac{2394}{1825} \\approx 121.31 < 124$.\n- {A, B, F}: Cost $900,000$. Benefit $\\frac{336}{73} + 90 + 4 \\approx 98.60 < 124$.\n\nThe combination {B, E, F} is indeed optimal. The maximum expected total DALYs averted per year is $124$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{124}$$", "id": "4516419"}]}
