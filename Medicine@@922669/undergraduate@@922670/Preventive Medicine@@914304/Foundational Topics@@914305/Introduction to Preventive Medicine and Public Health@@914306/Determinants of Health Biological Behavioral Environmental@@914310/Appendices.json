A moderate-intensity statin is offered. Based on trial data, the ten-year Relative Risk Reduction (RRR) is $r = 0.25$.

It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires the calculation of the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) for two distinct populations and the ratio of these two values. The NNT is a measure of the effectiveness of a health intervention, representing the average number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one additional bad outcome. It is defined as the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR).\n\nThe key definitions are:\n1.  **Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR):** The absolute difference in the event rate between the control group (untreated) and the treated group. It is calculated as the baseline risk multiplied by the Relative Risk Reduction (RRR).\n    $$ \\mathrm{ARR} = p_0 \\times \\mathrm{RRR} $$\n    where $p_0$ is the baseline absolute risk for the untreated population.\n\n2.  **Number Needed to Treat (NNT):** The reciprocal of the ARR.\n    $$ \\mathrm{NNT} = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{ARR}} = \\frac{1}{p_0 \\times \\mathrm{RRR}} $$\n\nThe problem describes how determinants of health create heterogeneity between the two neighborhoods.\n-   **Biological determinants** (e.g., genetics, age structure, prevalent comorbidities) are reflected in the different baseline risks. Neighborhood B has a significantly higher baseline risk ($p_{0,B} = 0.20$) compared to Neighborhood A ($p_{0,A} = 0.08$), suggesting a population that is biologically more vulnerable to cardiovascular disease.\n-   **Behavioral and environmental determinants** (e.g., barriers to healthcare access, medication costs, health literacy, social support) are cited as the reason for a lower realized RRR in Neighborhood B ($r_B = 0.15$) compared to Neighborhood A ($r_A = 0.25$). This illustrates how the context in which an intervention is delivered modifies its real-world effectiveness.\n\nWe now proceed to calculate the NNT for each neighborhood.\n\n**For Neighborhood A:**\nThe baseline risk is $p_{0,A} = 0.08$.\nThe realized Relative Risk Reduction is $r_{A} = 0.25$.\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction for Neighborhood A, $\\mathrm{ARR}_A$, is:\n$$ \\mathrm{ARR}_{A} = p_{0,A} \\times r_{A} = 0.08 \\times 0.25 = 0.02 $$\nThe Number Needed to Treat for Neighborhood A, $\\mathrm{NNT}_A$, is:\n$$ \\mathrm{NNT}_{A} = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{ARR}_{A}} = \\frac{1}{0.02} = 50 $$\nThis means that over $10$ years in Neighborhood A, $50$ people must be treated with the moderate-intensity statin to prevent one cardiovascular event.\n\n**For Neighborhood B:**\nThe baseline risk is $p_{0,B} = 0.20$.\nThe realized Relative Risk Reduction is $r_{B} = 0.15$.\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction for Neighborhood B, $\\mathrm{ARR}_B$, is:\n$$ \\mathrm{ARR}_{B} = p_{0,B} \\times r_{B} = 0.20 \\times 0.15 = 0.03 $$\nThe Number Needed to Treat for Neighborhood B, $\\mathrm{NNT}_B$, is:\n$$ \\mathrm{NNT}_{B} = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{ARR}_{B}} = \\frac{1}{0.03} = \\frac{100}{3} $$\nThis means that over $10$ years in Neighborhood B, approximately $33$ people must be treated to prevent one cardiovascular event. Despite the lower medication effectiveness (lower RRR), the higher baseline risk of the population makes the intervention more efficient in absolute terms.\n\n**Compute the Ratio R:**\nThe final step is to compute the ratio $R = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{NNT}_{B}}{\\mathrm{NNT}_{A}}$.\n$$ R = \\frac{\\mathrm{NNT}_{B}}{\\mathrm{NNT}_{A}} = \\frac{1/\\mathrm{ARR}_{B}}{1/\\mathrm{ARR}_{A}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{ARR}_{A}}{\\mathrm{ARR}_{B}} $$\nSubstituting the calculated ARR values:\n$$ R = \\frac{0.02}{0.03} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\nAs a decimal, $R = 0.6666...$.\nRounding to three significant figures as required by the problem statement, we get:\n$$ R \\approx 0.667 $$\nThis result demonstrates that the NNT is lower in the high-risk, lower-adherence neighborhood. Specifically, the number of people who must be treated in Neighborhood B to prevent one event is only about two-thirds of the number required in Neighborhood A. This highlights the critical public health principle that intervention impact (measured by ARR and NNT) is a function of both the intervention's relative efficacy (RRR) and the underlying risk of the target population.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.667}$$", "id": "4519526"}, {"introduction": "Health outcomes are rarely the result of a single factor; more often, they arise from a complex interplay between multiple biological, behavioral, and environmental determinants.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of epidemiology, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. It requests the derivation and calculation of a standard epidemiological measure of interaction.\n\nLet the stratum-specific $10$-year risks of lung cancer be denoted by $R_{ij}$, where $i=1$ for smokers and $i=0$ for non-smokers, and $j=1$ for asbestos exposure and $j=0$ for no asbestos exposure. The risk among individuals with neither exposure is the baseline risk, $R_{00}$. The risk among those with only smoking exposure is $R_{10}$, only asbestos exposure is $R_{01}$, and both exposures is $R_{11}$.\n\nThe provided risks are:\n- $R_{00} = 0.004$\n- $R_{10} = 0.012$\n- $R_{01} = 0.010$\n- $R_{11} = 0.032$\n\nInteraction between two exposures can be assessed on two primary scales: additive and multiplicative.\n\n**Interaction on the Additive Scale**\nThis scale considers the absolute increase in risk, known as the Risk Difference ($RD$). The excess risk due to smoking alone is the risk difference compared to the baseline:\n$$RD_{10} = R_{10} - R_{00}$$\nThe excess risk due to asbestos exposure alone is:\n$$RD_{01} = R_{01} - R_{00}$$\nIf the two exposures act independently on an additive scale, the total excess risk for an individual with both exposures would be the sum of the individual excess risks. The expected risk under a model of pure additivity, $R_{11}^{\\text{add}}$, would be:\n$$R_{11}^{\\text{add}} = R_{00} + RD_{10} + RD_{01} = R_{00} + (R_{10} - R_{00}) + (R_{01} - R_{00}) = R_{10} + R_{01} - R_{00}$$\nAdditive interaction is present if the observed risk in the doubly exposed group, $R_{11}$, deviates from this expected risk. The magnitude of this interaction, $I_{\\text{add}}$, is the difference:\n$$I_{\\text{add}} = R_{11} - R_{11}^{\\text{add}} = R_{11} - (R_{10} + R_{01} - R_{00}) = R_{11} - R_{10} - R_{01} + R_{00}$$\nIf $I_{\\text{add}} > 0$, the interaction is synergistic (positive). If $I_{\\text{add}}  0$, it is antagonistic (negative). If $I_{\\text{add}} = 0$, there is no additive interaction.\n\n**Interaction on the Multiplicative Scale**\nThis scale considers the ratio of risks, known as the Relative Risk ($RR$). The relative risk due to smoking alone, relative to the baseline, is:\n$$RR_{10} = \\frac{R_{10}}{R_{00}}$$\nThe relative risk due to asbestos exposure alone is:\n$$RR_{01} = \\frac{R_{01}}{R_{00}}$$\nIf the two exposures act independently on a multiplicative scale, the combined relative risk for an individual with both exposures would be the product of the individual relative risks. The expected relative risk under a model of pure multiplicativity, $RR_{11}^{\\text{mult}}$, would be:\n$$RR_{11}^{\\text{mult}} = RR_{10} \\times RR_{01}$$\nMultiplicative interaction is present if the observed relative risk in the doubly exposed group, $RR_{11} = R_{11}/R_{00}$, deviates from this expected relative risk. The measure of interaction is often expressed as the ratio $I_{\\text{mult}} = RR_{11} / RR_{11}^{\\text{mult}}$. If $I_{\\text{mult}} > 1$, the interaction is synergistic. If $I_{\\text{mult}}  1$, it is antagonistic. If $I_{\\text{mult}} = 1$, there is no multiplicative interaction.\n\n**Derivation of the Relative Excess Risk due to Interaction (RERI)**\nRERI is a measure of interaction on the additive scale, but it is expressed in terms of relative risks. It quantifies the excess relative risk that is attributable to the interaction itself. RERI is defined as the additive interaction term, $I_{\\text{add}}$, scaled by the baseline risk, $R_{00}$.\n$$RERI = \\frac{I_{\\text{add}}}{R_{00}} = \\frac{R_{11} - R_{10} - R_{01} + R_{00}}{R_{00}}$$\nWe can decompose this fraction:\n$$RERI = \\frac{R_{11}}{R_{00}} - \\frac{R_{10}}{R_{00}} - \\frac{R_{01}}{R_{00}} + \\frac{R_{00}}{R_{00}}$$\nSubstituting the definitions for relative risk ($RR_{ij} = R_{ij}/R_{00}$), we obtain the standard expression for RERI:\n$$RERI = RR_{11} - RR_{10} - RR_{01} + 1$$\nThis expression can also be written in terms of Excess Relative Risk ($ERR = RR - 1$) as $RERI = ERR_{11} - ERR_{10} - ERR_{01}$. A RERI value of $0$ indicates no additive interaction, while a value greater than $0$ indicates a synergistic additive interaction.\n\n**Computation of RERI**\nUsing the given risk values, we first compute the required relative risks:\nThe relative risk for smoking alone is:\n$$RR_{10} = \\frac{R_{10}}{R_{00}} = \\frac{0.012}{0.004} = 3.0$$\nThe relative risk for asbestos exposure alone is:\n$$RR_{01} = \\frac{R_{01}}{R_{00}} = \\frac{0.010}{0.004} = 2.5$$\nThe relative risk for joint exposure to smoking and asbestos is:\n$$RR_{11} = \\frac{R_{11}}{R_{00}} = \\frac{0.032}{0.004} = 8.0$$\nNow, we substitute these values into the derived formula for RERI:\n$$RERI = RR_{11} - RR_{10} - RR_{01} + 1$$\n$$RERI = 8.0 - 3.0 - 2.5 + 1.0 = 3.5$$\nA RERI of $3.5$ indicates a strong synergistic interaction on the additive scale. The combined effect of smoking and asbestos is $3.5$ times greater than the baseline risk, beyond what would be expected from simply adding the excess risks of each exposure individually.\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $3.5$ is exact. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $3.50$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{3.50} $$", "id": "4519523"}, {"introduction": "A cornerstone of rigorous scientific inquiry is to question the certainty of one's own findings. In epidemiology, even the most carefully designed study may be affected by unmeasured confounding variables that can distort the true relationship between an exposure and an outcome. This exercise introduces a powerful sensitivity analysis tool, the E-value, which allows you to quantitatively assess the potential impact of such unmeasured confounding. By calculating and interpreting the E-value for an observed association, you will practice a key skill in modern epidemiology: determining how robust a study's conclusion is against potential hidden biases.", "problem": "A prospective cohort study in preventive medicine investigates the behavioral determinant of physical activity in relation to mortality (a biological health outcome) over a follow-up period of $10$ years. After adjustment for measured confounders that include age, sex, cigarette smoking status, body mass index, and baseline comorbidities, the proportional hazards model estimates a hazard ratio (HR) of $0.80$ for high versus low physical activity relative to all-cause mortality. The investigators wish to quantify how strong an unmeasured confounder from biological (for example, genetic frailty), behavioral (for example, unrecorded substance use), or environmental (for example, ambient air pollution exposure) domains would need to be, in terms of associations on the risk ratio scale, to fully explain away the observed association to the null.\n\nUse the following widely accepted principles as the fundamental base:\n- The hazard ratio (HR) is a ratio-scale measure of relative hazard; under the proportional hazards assumption and when the outcome is not common over short intervals, the HR can be used analogously to a risk ratio (RR) for sensitivity analyses on the ratio scale.\n- Confounding bias on the ratio scale can be bounded in terms of the strength of the association between an unmeasured confounder and the outcome and between that confounder and the exposure, both on the risk ratio scale.\n\nStarting from these principles, derive the minimal equal-strength association (on the risk ratio scale) that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both physical activity and mortality, beyond the measured covariates, in order to move the observed estimate to the null. Then compute this quantity, known in the epidemiologic literature as the E-value, for the observed hazard ratio of $0.80$.\n\nExpress your final answer as a unitless ratio rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of a sensitivity analysis parameter known in epidemiology as the E-value. This parameter quantifies the required strength of an unmeasured confounder to explain away an observed association.\n\nFirst, we must validate the problem statement. The problem is set within the context of a prospective cohort study in preventive medicine, a standard design for etiological research. It employs concepts such as the hazard ratio (HR) from a proportional hazards model, confounding, and determinants of health (biological, behavioral, environmental), all of which are scientifically grounded and standard in this field. The givens are an observed HR of $0.80$ from a high versus low physical activity comparison on all-cause mortality, a follow-up period of $10$ years, and a list of adjusted confounders. The problem asks for a derivation based on stated principles which are widely accepted in epidemiological practice: the HR can approximate a risk ratio (RR), and confounding bias is a function of the confounder's associations with the exposure and the outcome. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and well-posed. Thus, the problem is deemed valid and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $RR_{\\text{obs}}$ denote the observed risk ratio, which, according to the problem's principles, we can approximate with the given hazard ratio, $HR$. Let $RR_{\\text{true}}$ be the true, unconfounded risk ratio. The effect of an unmeasured confounder, $U$, can be summarized by a bias factor, $B$, such that $RR_{\\text{obs}} = RR_{\\text{true}} \\times B$. The problem asks for the conditions under which the observed association could be entirely due to confounding, which corresponds to a true null association, $RR_{\\text{true}} = 1$. In this case, the bias factor must be equal to the observed risk ratio: $B = RR_{\\text{obs}}$.\n\nThe observed hazard ratio is $HR=0.80$, which represents a protective effect. For the purpose of this analysis, it is conventional to work with risk ratios greater than $1$. We therefore invert the given HR to obtain the equivalent association in the opposite direction:\n$$ RR = \\frac{1}{HR} = \\frac{1}{0.80} = 1.25 $$\nTo explain this association away, an unmeasured confounder must be capable of producing a bias factor $B$ of at least $1.25$.\n\nThe second principle stated in the problem is that this bias factor is bounded by the strength of the confounder's association with the exposure ($E$, physical activity) and the outcome ($D$, mortality). Let $RR_{EU}$ be the risk ratio relating the confounder to the exposure, and $RR_{UD}$ be the risk ratio relating the confounder to the outcome.\n\nA standard derivation for the maximum bias factor, $B_{\\text{max}}$, that can be induced by a single dichotomous unmeasured confounder with specified $RR_{EU}$ and $RR_{UD}$ (both assumed to be $\\ge 1$) shows that:\n$$ B_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{RR_{EU} \\cdot RR_{UD}}{RR_{EU} + RR_{UD} - 1} $$\nWhile this formula is derived under specific assumptions, it provides a useful bound for sensitivity analysis. The problem asks for the scenario where the unmeasured confounder has an \"equal-strength association\" with both the exposure and the outcome. Let this common strength be denoted by $\\gamma$, so that $\\gamma = RR_{EU} = RR_{UD}$. Substituting $\\gamma$ into the expression for $B_{\\text{max}}$:\n$$ B_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{\\gamma \\cdot \\gamma}{\\gamma + \\gamma - 1} = \\frac{\\gamma^2}{2\\gamma - 1} $$\nTo explain away the observed risk ratio $RR = 1.25$, this maximum possible bias must be at least equal to $RR$. The minimal value of $\\gamma$ required would be the one for which $B_{\\text{max}}$ is exactly equal to $RR$.\n$$ RR = \\frac{\\gamma^2}{2\\gamma - 1} $$\nWe must now solve this equation for $\\gamma$.\n$$ RR \\cdot (2\\gamma - 1) = \\gamma^2 $$\n$$ 2 \\gamma \\cdot RR - RR = \\gamma^2 $$\nRearranging into the standard quadratic form $a\\gamma^2 + b\\gamma + c = 0$:\n$$ \\gamma^2 - (2 \\cdot RR) \\gamma + RR = 0 $$\nWe solve for $\\gamma$ using the quadratic formula, $\\gamma = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=1$, $b=-2 \\cdot RR$, and $c=RR$:\n$$ \\gamma = \\frac{ -(-2 \\cdot RR) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2 \\cdot RR)^2 - 4(1)(RR)} }{2(1)} $$\n$$ \\gamma = \\frac{2 \\cdot RR \\pm \\sqrt{4 \\cdot RR^2 - 4 \\cdot RR}}{2} $$\n$$ \\gamma = \\frac{2 \\cdot RR \\pm 2\\sqrt{RR^2 - RR}}{2} $$\n$$ \\gamma = RR \\pm \\sqrt{RR(RR-1)} $$\nWe have two potential solutions. However, the quantity $\\gamma$ represents a risk ratio and must be greater than or equal to $1$. For any $RR > 1$, we note that $RR-1  \\sqrt{RR(RR-1)}$. Consequently, the solution $RR - \\sqrt{RR(RR-1)}$ may be less than $1$. In fact, for $RR>1$, we have $(RR-1)^2 = RR^2-2RR+1  RR^2-RR = RR(RR-1)$, which implies $RR-1  \\sqrt{RR(RR-1)}$. Thus, $RR - \\sqrt{RR(RR-1)}  1$. As a meaningful confounder association strength must be $\\gamma \\ge 1$ to create positive bias, we must select the positive root. This gives the minimal required strength of association:\n$$ \\gamma = RR + \\sqrt{RR(RR-1)} $$\nThis is the formula for the E-value.\n\nNow, we compute this value for the given problem, where $RR = 1.25$:\n$$ \\text{E-value} = 1.25 + \\sqrt{1.25(1.25 - 1)} $$\n$$ \\text{E-value} = 1.25 + \\sqrt{1.25(0.25)} $$\n$$ \\text{E-value} = 1.25 + \\sqrt{0.3125} $$\nTo obtain the numerical result:\n$$ \\sqrt{0.3125} \\approx 0.559017 $$\n$$ \\text{E-value} \\approx 1.25 + 0.559017 = 1.809017 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\text{E-value} \\approx 1.81 $$\nThis result means that an unmeasured confounder that was not accounted for in the analysis would need to be associated with both high physical activity and all-cause mortality by a risk ratio of at least $1.81$ each, above and beyond the measured confounders, to be able to fully explain away the observed protective effect of physical activity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.81}$$", "id": "4519486"}]}
