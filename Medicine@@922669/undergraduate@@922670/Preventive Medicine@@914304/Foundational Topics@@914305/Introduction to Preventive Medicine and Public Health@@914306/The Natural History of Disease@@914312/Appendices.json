For this disease, a cohort is observed from first exposure to a specific causal risk factor at time $t=0$ years. A validated disease-specific biomarker that objectively reflects the earliest detectable pathophysiological abnormality first becomes elevated at time $t=5$ years. First subjective symptoms attributable to the disease occur at time $t=12$ years.

This is the stage where the disease is present and detectable by objective measures (like a biomarker) but has not yet produced subjective symptoms.\n    The start of this period is the time of the earliest detectable abnormality, $t_{\\text{bio}}$.\n    The end of this period is the time of first symptom onset, $t_{\\text{sym}}$.\n    The duration is the difference between these two time points:\n    $$d_{\\text{subclinical}} = t_{\\text{sym}} - t_{\\text{bio}}$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$d_{\\text{subclinical}} = 12 \\text{ years} - 5 \\text{ years} = 7 \\text{ years}$$\n\n3.  **Clinical Period Duration ($d_{\\text{clinical}}$)**\n    The problem defines the clinical disease period as beginning at symptom onset and ending at the clinical outcome. This is the stage where the disease is manifest through symptoms experienced by the patient.\n    The start of this period is the time of first symptom onset, $t_{\\text{sym}}$.\n    The end of this period is the time of the clinical outcome, $t_{\\text{out}}$.\n    The duration is the difference between these two time points:\n    $$d_{\\text{clinical}} = t_{\\text{out}} - t_{\\text{sym}}$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$d_{\\text{clinical}} = 20 \\text{ years} - 12 \\text{ years} = 8 \\text{ years}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a single row matrix in the order ($d_{\\text{induction}}, d_{\\text{subclinical}}, d_{\\text{clinical}}$).

Let $T^+$ be the event that the test result is positive, and $T^-$ be the event that the test result is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n1.  The prevalence of the disease is the prior probability of having the disease, $P(D)$.\n    $$P(D) = 0.02$$\n    The probability of not having the disease is the complement:\n    $$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98$$\n\n2.  The sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test result given that the individual has the disease, $P(T^+|D)$.\n    $$P(T^+|D) = 0.90$$\n    The probability of a false negative (a negative test result given that the individual has the disease) is the complement:\n    $$P(T^-|D) = 1 - P(T^+|D) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$$\n\n3.  The specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test result given that the individual does not have the disease, $P(T^-|D^c)$.\n    $$P(T^-|D^c) = 0.95$$\n    The probability of a false positive (a positive test result given that the individual does not have the disease) is the complement:\n    $$P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\n\n**Calculation of the Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\nThe PPV is the probability that an individual with a positive test result actually has the disease. This is the conditional probability $P(D|T^+)$. We use Bayes' theorem to calculate this value:\n$$PPV = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D)P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nTo use this formula, we first need to find the total probability of a positive test result, $P(T^+)$. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$P(T^+) = (0.90)(0.02) + (0.05)(0.98)$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.018 + 0.049 = 0.067$$\nNow we can compute the PPV:\n$$PPV = \\frac{P(T^+|D)P(D)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{0.018}{0.067}$$\n$$PPV \\approx 0.2686567...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$PPV \\approx 0.2687$$\n\n**Calculation of the Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\nThe NPV is the probability that an individual with a negative test result is truly free of the disease. This is the conditional probability $P(D^c|T^-)$. We again use Bayes' theorem:\n$$NPV = P(D^c|T^-) = \\frac{P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nFirst, we find the total probability of a negative test result, $P(T^-)$. We can use the law of total probability again:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^-|D)P(D) + P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$P(T^-) = (0.10)(0.02) + (0.95)(0.98)$$\n$$P(T^-) = 0.002 + 0.931 = 0.933$$\n(Note that $P(T^+) + P(T^-) = 0.067 + 0.933 = 1.0$, as expected.)\nNow we can compute the NPV:\n$$NPV = \\frac{P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T^-)} = \\frac{(0.95)(0.98)}{0.933} = \\frac{0.931}{0.933}$$\n$$NPV \\approx 0.9978563...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$NPV \\approx 0.9979$$\n\nThe calculated values are PPV $\\approx 0.2687$ and NPV $\\approx 0.9979$.

This is determined by the seroprevalence acting on the total population:\n$$\nI_{true} = N \\times S_p\n$$\n\nSecond, the denominator, which is the number of detected cases ($C_{det}$). This is a multi-step calculation. Infections are partitioned into symptomatic and asymptomatic groups.\n- The number of symptomatic infections ($I_{sym}$) is the total number of infections multiplied by the symptomatic proportion:\n$$\nI_{sym} = I_{true} \\times P_{sym} = (N \\times S_p) \\times P_{sym}\n$$\n- The problem states that detection among asymptomatic infections is negligible, which we formalize as a detection probability of $0$ for asymptomatic cases. Therefore, all detected cases must come from the pool of symptomatic individuals.\n- The number of detected cases is the number of symptomatic infections multiplied by the detection probability for symptomatic cases:\n$$\nC_{det} = I_{sym} \\times P_{det|sym} = ((N \\times S_p) \\times P_{sym}) \\times P_{det|sym}\n$$\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions back into the definition of the iceberg undercount factor $F_u$:\n$$\nF_u = \\frac{I_{true}}{C_{det}} = \\frac{N \\times S_p}{(N \\times S_p) \\times P_{sym} \\times P_{det|sym}}\n$$\n\nThe term for the total number of infections, $N \\times S_p$, appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it can be cancelled. This demonstrates that the undercount factor is independent of the overall population size and the seroprevalence, and is exclusively a function of the conditional probabilities of the disease's natural history and detection process.\n$$\nF_u = \\frac{1}{P_{sym} \\times P_{det|sym}}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided:\n- $P_{sym} = 0.25$\n- $P_{det|sym} = 0.60$\n\n$$\nF_u = \\frac{1}{0.25 \\times 0.60}\n$$\n\nFirst, calculate the product in the denominator.
