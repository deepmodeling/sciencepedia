The proportion of the population that is unexposed is therefore $1-p$.\n- $I_{total}$: The total incidence of the disease in the population.\n\nThe total incidence is the weighted average of the incidences in the exposed and unexposed subgroups, weighted by their respective proportions in the population:\n$$I_{total} = p \\cdot I_e + (1-p) \\cdot I_u$$\n\nThe risk ratio ($RR$) is defined as the ratio of the incidence in the exposed group to the incidence in the unexposed group:\n$$RR = \\frac{I_e}{I_u}$$\nFrom this definition, we can express the incidence in the exposed as a function of the incidence in the unexposed and the risk ratio:\n$$I_e = RR \\cdot I_u$$\n\nThe population attributable fraction ($PAF$) is defined as the proportional reduction in the total population incidence that would occur if the exposure were eliminated. If the exposure were eliminated, the entire population would experience the incidence rate of the unexposed group, $I_u$. Let us denote this hypothetical new total incidence as $I'_{total}$.\n$$I'_{total} = I_u$$\nThe $PAF$ is then calculated as the difference between the current total incidence and the hypothetical new total incidence, divided by the current total incidence:\n$$PAF = \\frac{I_{total} - I'_{total}}{I_{total}} = \\frac{I_{total} - I_u}{I_{total}}$$\n\nTo derive the expression for $PAF$ in terms of only $p$ and $RR$, we substitute the expressions for $I_{total}$ and $I_e$ into the formula for $PAF$.\nFirst, substitute the expression for $I_{total}$:\n$$PAF = \\frac{(p \\cdot I_e + (1-p) \\cdot I_u) - I_u}{p \\cdot I_e + (1-p) \\cdot I_u}$$\nNow, substitute $I_e = RR \\cdot I_u$ into this equation:\n$$PAF = \\frac{(p \\cdot (RR \\cdot I_u) + (1-p) \\cdot I_u) - I_u}{p \\cdot (RR \\cdot I_u) + (1-p) \\cdot I_u}$$\nThe term $I_u$ is a common factor in every term of the numerator and the denominator. Assuming $I_u  0$ (a non-zero background incidence of the disease), we can factor out and cancel $I_u$:\n$$PAF = \\frac{I_u \\cdot [p \\cdot RR + (1-p) - 1]}{I_u \\cdot [p \\cdot RR + (1-p)]}$$\n$$PAF = \\frac{p \\cdot RR + 1 - p - 1}{p \\cdot RR + 1 - p}$$\nSimplifying the numerator gives the final expression for $PAF$ solely in terms of $p$ and $RR$:\n$$PAF = \\frac{p \\cdot RR - p}{p \\cdot RR - p + 1} = \\frac{p \\cdot (RR - 1)}{p \\cdot (RR - 1) + 1}$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we evaluate this expression using the given values: $p = 0.35$ and $RR = 1.6$.\n$$PAF = \\frac{0.35 \\cdot (1.6 - 1)}{0.35 \\cdot (1.6 - 1) + 1}$$\n$$PAF = \\frac{0.35 \\cdot (0.6)}{0.35 \\cdot (0.6) + 1}$$\n$$PAF = \\frac{0.21}{0.21 + 1}$$\n$$PAF = \\frac{0.21}{1.21}$$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$PAF \\approx 0.173553719...$$\n\nFor the third part, we round the result to four significant figures.\n$$PAF \\approx 0.1736$$\n\nFor the fourth part, we provide an interpretation of this value. If the exposure were eliminated from the population and the observed association is causal, the total incidence of the chronic disease would decrease by approximately $17.36\\%$.
