A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of a point estimate and a $95\\%$ exact confidence interval for an incidence rate.\n\n#### Part 1: Point Estimate of the Incidence Rate\n\nThe incidence rate, denoted by $\\lambda$, is defined as the number of new events per unit of person-time at risk. The point estimate, $\\hat{\\lambda}$, is calculated as the total number of observed events, $d$, divided by the total person-time at risk, $PT$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total person-time at risk by summing the follow-up times for all participants:\n$$\nPT = 1.2 \\text{ years} + 0.8 \\text{ years} + 2.0 \\text{ years} + 0.5 \\text{ years}\n$$\n$$\nPT = 4.5 \\text{ person-years}\n$$\n\nThe number of observed events is given as $d = 3$.\n\nThe point estimate of the incidence rate is then:\n$$\n\\hat{\\lambda} = \\frac{d}{PT} = \\frac{3}{4.5} = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ events per person-year}\n$$\nConverting this to a decimal, we get:\n$$\n\\hat{\\lambda} \\approx 0.666666... \\text{ events per person-year}\n$$\n\n#### Part 2: 95% Exact Confidence Interval for the Incidence Rate\n\nThe problem specifies that the number of events follows a Poisson distribution. The total number of events, $d=3$, is a single observation from a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu$. The mean $\\mu$ is related to the incidence rate $\\lambda$ and the total person-time $PT$ by the equation $\\mu = \\lambda \\times PT$.\n\nTo find the confidence interval for the rate $\\lambda$, we first compute the confidence interval for the mean count $\\mu$, and then divide its limits by $PT$.\n\nThe exact confidence interval for a Poisson mean $\\mu$, given an observed count $d$, is based on the relationship between the Poisson and chi-squared ($\\chi^2$) distributions. For a $(1-\\alpha) \\times 100\\%$ confidence interval, the lower limit $\\mu_L$ and upper limit $\\mu_U$ for the mean $\\mu$ are given by:\n$$\n\\mu_L = \\frac{1}{2} \\chi^2_{\\alpha/2, 2d}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_U = \\frac{1}{2} \\chi^2_{1-\\alpha/2, 2(d+1)}\n$$\nwhere $\\chi^2_{p, \\nu}$ is the quantile of the chi-squared distribution with $\\nu$ degrees of freedom that has a cumulative probability of $p$.\n\nFor a $95\\%$ confidence interval, $1-\\alpha = 0.95$, so $\\alpha = 0.05$ and $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$.\nThe observed number of events is $d=3$.\n\nThe degrees of freedom for the lower limit are $2d = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\nThe degrees of freedom for the upper limit are $2(d+1) = 2 \\times (3+1) = 8$.\n\nWe need the following chi-squared quantiles:\n- For the lower limit: $\\chi^2_{\\alpha/2, 2d} = \\chi^2_{0.025, 6}$\n- For the upper limit: $\\chi^2_{1-\\alpha/2, 2(d+1)} = \\chi^2_{0.975, 8}$\n\nUsing statistical tables or software, we find these values:\n$$\n\\chi^2_{0.025, 6} \\approx 1.237344\n$$\n$$\n\\chi^2_{0.975, 8} \\approx 17.534546\n$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the confidence limits for the mean count $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mu_L = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1.237344 = 0.618672\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_U = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 17.534546 = 8.767273\n$$\nThese are the lower and upper limits for the expected number of events over $4.5$ person-years.\n\nTo find the confidence interval for the incidence rate $\\lambda$, we divide these limits by the total person-time, $PT = 4.5$ person-years.\n$$\n\\lambda_L = \\frac{\\mu_L}{PT} = \\frac{0.618672}{4.5} \\approx 0.1374827 \\text{ events per person-year}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_U = \\frac{\\mu_U}{PT} = \\frac{8.767273}{4.5} \\approx 1.9482829 \\text{ events per person-year}\n$$\n\n#### Part 3: Final Results and Rounding\n\nThe problem requires rounding the point estimate, the lower limit, and the upper limit to four significant figures.\n\n- Point Estimate: $\\hat{\\lambda} \\approx 0.666666... \\to 0.6667$\n- Lower Confidence Limit: $\\lambda_L \\approx 0.1374827... \\to 0.1375$\n- Upper Confidence Limit: $\\lambda_U \\approx 1.9482829... \\to 1.948$\n\nThe final result is the ordered triplet $(\\hat{\\lambda}, \\lambda_L, \\lambda_U)$.\nThe three values are $(0.6667, 0.1375, 1.948)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.6667  0.1375  1.948\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4547023"}, {"introduction": "Often, we want to compare disease rates between two different populations, but this can be misleading if the populations have different underlying characteristics, such as age distribution.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of epidemiology, self-contained, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data for the calculation of a directly standardized incidence rate are provided.\n\nThe primary objective is to compute the directly standardized incidence rate for Harbor City. This process removes the confounding effect of age structure, allowing for a more equitable comparison of rates between populations with different age distributions. The method involves applying the age-specific incidence rates from the study population (Harbor City) to the age structure of a reference or standard population.\n\nLet the age strata be indexed by $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, corresponding to the age groups $0$–$19$, $20$–$49$, $50$–$79$, and $\\geq 80$ years, respectively.\n\nFirst, we calculate the age-specific incidence rates ($ASIR_i$) for Harbor City.

Let $PT_{S,i}$ denote the person-years in the standard population for stratum $i$.\n- $PT_{S,1} = 30,000$ person-years\n- $PT_{S,2} = 40,000$ person-years\n- $PT_{S,3} = 25,000$ person-years\n- $PT_{S,4} = 5,000$ person-years\n\nThe total person-time in the standard population is:\n$$ PT_S = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} PT_{S,i} = 30,000 + 40,000 + 25,000 + 5,000 = 100,000 \\text{ person-years} $$\n\nTo find the directly standardized rate, we first calculate the number of cases that would be expected in each stratum of the standard population if it experienced the age-specific rates of Harbor City.

The incidence rates are substantially higher in the older age groups ($ASIR_3$ and $ASIR_4$ are much larger than $ASIR_1$ and $ASIR_2$). The standard population has a slightly older age structure than Harbor City (e.g., the proportion of person-time for ages $50+$ is ($25,000+5,000)/100,000 = 30\\%$ in the standard population, versus ($90,000+15,000)/405,000 \\approx 25.9\\%$ in Harbor City). By applying Harbor City's high age-specific rates to the older structure of the standard population, we obtain a higher overall rate. This standardized rate represents the rate that would be observed in Harbor City if it had the same age structure as the standard population, thereby providing a basis for comparison that is free from the confounding effect of age.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{3.317} $$", "id": "4546940"}, {"introduction": "The measures of incidence and prevalence are not independent; they are linked in a dynamic equilibrium governed by the duration of a disease.

The population is divided into two compartments: Susceptible ($S$) and Infectious ($I$). By definition, $S + I = N$.\n\nPoint prevalence, $p$, is the proportion of the population that is infectious at a specific point in time.\n$$p = \\frac{I}{N}$$\nFrom this, the number of infectious individuals is $I = pN$. Consequently, the number of susceptible individuals is $S = N - I = N - pN = N(1-p)$.\n\nThe incidence rate, $\\lambda$, is defined as the rate of new cases per susceptible person per unit time. Therefore, the total number of new infections occurring per unit time is the product of the incidence rate and the size of the susceptible population:\n$$ \\text{Rate of infection} = \\lambda S = \\lambda N(1-p) $$\n\nThe mean duration of disease is $D$. The rate of recovery, $\\gamma$, is the reciprocal of the mean duration, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{D}$. This represents the rate at which infectious individuals recover and return to the susceptible state. The total number of recoveries per unit time is the product of the recovery rate and the size of the infectious population:\n$$ \\text{Rate of recovery} = \\gamma I = \\frac{1}{D} I = \\frac{pN}{D} $$\n\nThe problem specifies \"steady-state conditions\". In a steady state, the number of individuals in each compartment is constant. This requires that the rate of flow into the infectious compartment (rate of infection) must equal the rate of flow out of the infectious compartment (rate of recovery).\n$$ \\text{Rate of infection} = \\text{Rate of recovery} $$\n$$ \\lambda S = \\gamma I $$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $S$, $I$, and $\\gamma$ yields:\n$$ \\lambda N(1-p) = \\frac{pN}{D} $$\nThe total population size, $N$, is non-zero and cancels from both sides, providing the fundamental relationship between prevalence $p$, incidence rate $\\lambda$, and mean duration $D$:\n$$ \\lambda (1-p) = \\frac{p}{D} $$\nThis expression fulfills the first part of the problem. This equation can be rearranged to solve for prevalence $p$:\n$$ \\lambda D (1-p) = p $$\n$$ \\lambda D - \\lambda D p = p $$\n$$ \\lambda D = p (1 + \\lambda D) $$\n$$ p = \\frac{\\lambda D}{1 + \\lambda D} $$\nA further useful rearrangement expresses the prevalence odds, $\\frac{p}{1-p}$, directly in terms of $\\lambda$ and $D$:\n$$ \\frac{p}{1-p} = \\lambda D $$\n\nNow, for the second part of the problem, we apply this relationship to the two scenarios: baseline (subscript $0$) and post-intervention (subscript $1$).\nThe given information is:\n-   Baseline: $\\lambda_{0} = 0.025$ per person-year, $D_{0} = 2$ years.\n-   Post-intervention: $\\lambda_{1} = 0.050$ per person-year.\nThe core condition is that the point prevalence remains stable, i.e., $p_{0} = p_{1}$.\n\nUsing the derived relationship for prevalence odds, we have:\nFor the baseline scenario:\n$$ \\frac{p_{0}}{1-p_{0}} = \\lambda_{0} D_{0} $$\nFor the post-intervention scenario:\n$$ \\frac{p_{1}}{1-p_{1}} = \\lambda_{1} D_{1} $$\nSince $p_{0} = p_{1}$, it directly follows that their prevalence odds must also be equal:\n$$ \\frac{p_{0}}{1-p_{0}} = \\frac{p_{1}}{1-p_{1}} $$\nTherefore, we can equate the right-hand sides of the two equations:\n$$ \\lambda_{0} D_{0} = \\lambda_{1} D_{1} $$\nWe need to compute the post-intervention mean duration, $D_{1}$. We can solve for $D_{1}$ algebraically:\n$$ D_{1} = \\frac{\\lambda_{0} D_{0}}{\\lambda_{1}} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$ D_{1} = \\frac{(0.025 \\text{ year}^{-1}) \\times (2 \\text{ years})}{0.050 \\text{ year}^{-1}} $$\n$$ D_{1} = \\frac{0.050 \\text{ years}}{0.050} $$\n$$ D_{1} = 1 \\text{ year} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
