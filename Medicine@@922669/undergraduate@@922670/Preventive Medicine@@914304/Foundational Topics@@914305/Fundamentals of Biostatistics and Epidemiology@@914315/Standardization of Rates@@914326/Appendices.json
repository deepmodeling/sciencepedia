A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to calculate the directly standardized incidence rate for City L. This rate represents a hypothetical overall incidence rate that would be observed in City L if it had the same age distribution as the standard population. The calculation is performed by applying the age-specific incidence rates of City L to the age-stratum populations of the standard population.\n\nLet $i$ be an index for each age stratum, from $i=1$ to $i=6$.\nLet $R_i$ be the age-specific incidence rate for stratum $i$ in City L, expressed per $100{,}000$ person-years.\nLet $N_i$ be the number of persons in stratum $i$ of the standard population.\n\nFirst, we establish the principle. An incidence rate is the number of new cases divided by the total person-time at risk. The age-specific rate $R_i$ for City L, when converted to a proportion, is $\\frac{R_i}{100{,}000}$. This proportion represents the number of cases per person-year.\n\nThe core of direct standardization is to calculate the total number of *expected cases* ($E_{\\text{total}}$) that would occur in the standard population if it were subject to City L's age-specific incidence rates. For each stratum $i$, the expected number of cases, $E_i$, is the product of City L's stratum-specific rate (as a proportion) and the number of person-years at risk in the standard population's stratum. Assuming a one-year period, the person-years at risk in the standard population stratum $i$ is equal to its population count, $N_i$.\n\n$$ E_i = \\left(\\frac{R_i}{100{,}000}\\right) \\times N_i $$\n\nThe total number of expected cases is the sum of the expected cases across all strata:\n$$ E_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} E_i $$\n\nThe total population of the standard reference group is:\n$$ N_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} N_i $$\n\nThe directly standardized rate, expressed as a proportion ($DSR_{\\text{prop}}$), is the total number of expected cases divided by the total standard population.\n$$ DSR_{\\text{prop}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{total}}}{N_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\left(\\frac{R_i}{100{,}000} \\times N_i\\right)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{6} N_i} $$\n\nTo express this rate per $100{,}000$ person-years, as required, we multiply the proportion by $100{,}000$.\n$$ DSR = DSR_{\\text{prop}} \\times 100{,}000 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\left(\\frac{R_i}{100{,}000} \\times N_i\\right)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{6} N_i} \\times 100{,}000 $$\nSimplifying this expression, we arrive at the standard formula for the directly standardized rate, which is a weighted average of the age-specific rates, where the weights are the proportions of each age group in the standard population:\n$$ DSR = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{6} (R_i \\times N_i)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{6} N_i} $$\n\nNow, we calculate the required components.\nFirst, the total standard population, $N_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$ N_{\\text{total}} = 60{,}000 + 40{,}000 + 80{,}000 + 50{,}000 + 20{,}000 + 10{,}000 = 260{,}000 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the numerator, which is the sum of the products of the age-specific rates and the standard population counts for each stratum. This sum represents the total expected cases if the rates were expressed per person, which are then scaled by the denominator.\nLet's calculate the term $R_i \\times N_i$ for each stratum $i$:\n- Stratum $1$: $R_1 \\times N_1 = 12 \\times 60{,}000 = 720{,}000$\n- Stratum $2$: $R_2 \\times N_2 = 18 \\times 40{,}000 = 720{,}000$\n- Stratum $3$: $R_3 \\times N_3 = 45 \\times 80{,}000 = 3{,}600{,}000$\n- Stratum $4$: $R_4 \\times N_4 = 210 \\times 50{,}000 = 10{,}500{,}000$\n- Stratum $5$: $R_5 \\times N_5 = 560 \\times 20{,}000 = 11{,}200{,}000$\n- Stratum $6$: $R_6 \\times N_6 = 900 \\times 10{,}000 = 9{,}000{,}000$\n\nThe sum of these products is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{6} (R_i \\times N_i) = 720{,}000 + 720{,}000 + 3{,}600{,}000 + 10{,}500{,}000 + 11{,}200{,}000 + 9{,}000{,}000 = 35{,}740{,}000 $$\n\nNow, we can compute the directly standardized rate ($DSR$):\n$$ DSR = \\frac{35{,}740{,}000}{260{,}000} = \\frac{3{,}574}{26} = \\frac{1{,}787}{13} $$\n\nPerforming the division:\n$$ DSR \\approx 137.461538... $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $3$, $7$, and $4$. The fifth significant figure is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$ DSR \\approx 137.5 $$\n\nThe directly standardized incidence rate for City L is $137.5$ per $100{,}000$ person-years.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{137.5}$$", "id": "4578812"}, {"introduction": "While direct standardization is powerful, we sometimes lack stable age-specific rates for our study population.

It suggests the presence of risk factors or adverse conditions in the study cohort.\n- $SMR = 1$: The observed mortality is equal to the expected mortality. This suggests that the study population's mortality experience is comparable to that of the standard population, after adjusting for age.\n- $SMR  1$: The observed number of deaths is less than expected. This indicates a lower mortality risk in the study population compared to the standard. In occupational health, this is often attributed to the \"healthy worker effect,\" where employed populations tend to be healthier than the general population, which includes those too ill to work.\nIn this case, the calculated $SMR$ of approximately $1.118$ indicates that the study cohort experienced about $11.8\\%$ more deaths than would have been expected based on the mortality rates of the external standard population, after accounting for the age distribution of the cohort.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.118}$$", "id": "4578803"}, {"introduction": "Crude rates can be dangerously misleading, a phenomenon starkly illustrated by Simpson's paradox, where a trend observed within every subgroup of a population disappears or reverses when the subgroups are combined.

This method calculates what the crude rate in each region would be if they both had the same \"standard\" age distribution. The standardized rate, $R_J^{\\text{std}}$, is a weighted average of the age-specific rates $R_{J,i}$, where the weights are derived from the person-time distribution of a standard population, $P_{S,i}$.\n$$R_J^{\\text{std}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} R_{J,i} \\cdot P_{S,i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} P_{S,i}}$$\nThe term $R_{J,i} \\cdot P_{S,i}$ represents the number of cases that would be expected in stratum $i$ of the standard population if it experienced the rate $R_{J,i}$.\n\nThe standard population has $P_{S,1} = 30{,}000$, $P_{S,2} = 30{,}000$, and $P_{S,3} = 30{,}000$ person-years. The total standard person-time is $P_S = \\sum P_{S,i} = 90{,}000$.\n\nFor Region X:\n- Expected cases in standard population:\n  - Stratum 1: $0.002 \\times 30{,}000 = 60$.\n  - Stratum 2: $0.008 \\times 30{,}000 = 240$.\n  - Stratum 3: $0.030 \\times 30{,}000 = 900$.\n- Total expected cases for X: $E_X = 60 + 240 + 900 = 1{,}200$.\n- Standardized rate for X:\n  $$R_X^{\\text{std}} = \\frac{1{,}200}{90{,}000} = \\frac{12}{900} = \\frac{1}{75}$$\nAs a decimal, $R_X^{\\text{std}} \\approx 0.01333...$\n\nFor Region Y:\n- Expected cases in standard population:\n  - Stratum 1: $0.003 \\times 30{,}000 = 90$.\n  - Stratum 2: $0.010 \\times 30{,}000 = 300$.\n  - Stratum 3: $0.035 \\times 30{,}000 = 1{,}050$.\n- Total expected cases for Y: $E_Y = 90 + 300 + 1{,}050 = 1{,}440$.\n- Standardized rate for Y:\n  $$R_Y^{\\text{std}} = \\frac{1{,}440}{90{,}000} = \\frac{144}{9{,}000} = \\frac{16}{1{,}000} = 0.016$$\n\nAfter standardization, $R_X^{\\text{std}} \\approx 0.0133$ and $R_Y^{\\text{std}} = 0.016$. The comparison $R_X^{\\text{std}}  R_Y^{\\text{std}}$ is now consistent with the stratum-specific findings.\n\n**Task 4: Report the directly standardized rate ratio.**\n\nThe directly standardized rate ratio ($SRR$) compares the standardized rates of the two regions.\n$$SRR = \\frac{R_X^{\\text{std}}}{R_Y^{\\text{std}}}$$\nUsing the exact fractional forms of the rates:\n$$SRR = \\frac{1/75}{0.016} = \\frac{1/75}{16/1000} = \\frac{1}{75} \\times \\frac{1000}{16} = \\frac{1000}{75 \\times 16} = \\frac{1000}{1200} = \\frac{10}{12} = \\frac{5}{6}$$\nAs a decimal, this is $0.833333...$. The problem requires rounding to four significant figures.\n$$SRR \\approx 0.8333$$\nThis ratio, being less than $1$, indicates that after adjusting for differences in age structure, the incidence rate of the disease is lower in Region X than in Region Y, resolving the paradox.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8333}$$", "id": "4578820"}]}
