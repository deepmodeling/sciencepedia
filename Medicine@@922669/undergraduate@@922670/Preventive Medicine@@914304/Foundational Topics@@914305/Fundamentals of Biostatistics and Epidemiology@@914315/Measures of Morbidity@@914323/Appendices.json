The cohort remains closed with complete follow-up for the entire $5$-year period: no individuals enter or leave, there are no losses to follow-up, and every incident case is ascertained. During the follow-up, exactly $450$ individuals experience their first-ever diagnosis of the disease of interest. Using the core definition that risk over a specified period in a closed cohort with complete follow-up is the probability that an initially disease-free individual develops the disease in that period, which in finite cohorts is estimated by the observed proportion of initially disease-free individuals who become incident cases during that period, compute the cumulative incidence over $5$ years and interpret the result as a risk for an initially disease-free individual in this cohort over the $5$-year period.

No units are required in the final numerical answer.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation and interpretation of the cumulative incidence of a disease in a closed cohort over a specified period. The validation process confirms that the problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data are provided, and the scenario, while idealized, is a standard model for teaching fundamental epidemiological concepts.\n\nThe core definition provided in the problem statement for risk in a closed cohort with complete follow-up is that it is estimated by the proportion of initially disease-free individuals who become new (incident) cases during the observation period. This is the definition of cumulative incidence, often denoted as $CI$.\n\nThe formula for cumulative incidence is:\n$$CI = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases of the disease during a specified period}}{\\text{Number of individuals in the population at risk at the start of the period}}$$\n\nLet us define the variables based on the information provided in the problem:\nThe number of individuals initially at risk, meaning they are disease-free at the start of the study (baseline), is $N_0$.\n$$N_0 = 5{,}000$$\nThe number of new (incident) cases that develop during the $5$-year follow-up period is $I$.\n$$I = 450$$\nThe duration of the follow-up period is $T = 5$ years.\n\nThe problem specifies a closed cohort with complete follow-up. This is a critical condition. \"Closed cohort\" means no new individuals enter the study after it begins. \"Complete follow-up\" means all individuals who started the study are accounted for at the end of the period, with their disease status known. In this idealized scenario, the initial population at risk, $N_0$, is the correct denominator for the entire period.\n\nUsing the formula for cumulative incidence, we can substitute the given values:\n$$CI_{\\text{5-year}} = \\frac{I}{N_0} = \\frac{450}{5{,}000}$$\n\nNow, we perform the calculation:\n$$CI_{\\text{5-year}} = 0.09$$\n\nThe problem requires the numerical answer to be expressed as a decimal proportion rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $0.09$. To express this with four significant figures, we must add trailing zeros. The first significant figure is the $9$. Therefore, we write the result as:\n$$CI_{\\text{5-year}} = 0.0900$$\n\nThe interpretation of this result, as requested, is that the cumulative incidence represents the average risk for an individual member of the cohort. An individual who was disease-free at the beginning of the $5$-year study period had a $0.0900$ probability (or a $9.00\\%$ chance) of developing the disease during that $5$-year span.
