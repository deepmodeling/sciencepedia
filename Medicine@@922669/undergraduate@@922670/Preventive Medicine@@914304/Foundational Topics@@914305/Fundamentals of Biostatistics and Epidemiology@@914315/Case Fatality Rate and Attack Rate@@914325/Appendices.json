This difference is attributable to confounding by age. The case-fatality rate is strongly associated with age, increasing from $0.005$ in the youngest group to $0.2$ in the oldest. The age distribution of cases in City Alpha is different from that of the reference population. In City Alpha, a substantial proportion of cases occurred in the older age groups ($39.5\\%$ in the $40\\text{–}64$ group and $28.9\\%$ in the $\\geq 65$ group), which have high fatality rates. In contrast, the reference population's cases are predominantly in the youngest age group ($66.7\\%$ in the $0\\text{–}39$ group), which has a very low fatality rate.\n\n    The crude CFR is a weighted average of the age-specific CFRs, where the weights are the proportion of total cases in each age group within City Alpha. Because these weights are skewed towards older, higher-risk ages, the crude rate is high. The standardized CFR is also a weighted average of the same age-specific CFRs, but the weights are derived from the age structure of the younger reference case population. By applying City Alpha's rates to this reference structure, we calculate the CFR that would have been observed in City Alpha if its case population had the same age distribution as the reference population. This adjustment removes the confounding effect of age, revealing a much lower rate and providing a more valid basis for comparing fatality risk with other populations that may have different age structures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.02733}$$", "id": "4508473"}, {"introduction": "During an active outbreak, epidemiologists face a critical challenge: many cases have not yet reached a final outcome of recovery or death. Let $U$ be the number of unresolved cases. Ignoring these cases or making a single, arbitrary assumption about their fate can bias the estimated Case Fatality Rate, $p$. This practice introduces a more rigorous approach called partial identification, where we use expert knowledge about the potential outcomes—for instance, that the proportion dying, $\\theta$, is in an interval $[\\underline{\\theta}, \\overline{\\theta}]$—to calculate a sharp interval of possible values for the true CFR.

The derivation must be based solely on the provided definitions and data.\n\nFirst, we formalize the relationship between the quantities. Let $D$ be the number of deaths, $R$ the number of recoveries, and $U$ the number of unresolved active cases at a given time. The total size of the closed cohort, $C$, is constant and is given by the sum of these outcomes:\n$$C = D + R + U$$\n\nThe ultimate CFR, $p$, is defined as the total number of ultimate deaths divided by the total cohort size $C$. The total number of ultimate deaths, which we can denote as $D_{total}$, is the sum of the deaths already observed, $D$, and the deaths that will occur among the currently unresolved cases, $U$.\n\nLet $\\theta$ be the fraction of the $U$ unresolved cases that will ultimately result in death. By definition, the number of future deaths from this group is $\\theta U$.

We are tasked with finding the sharp bounds on $p$ that are implied by this constraint on $\\theta$.\n\nTo find these bounds, we analyze the function $p(\\theta)$. The denominator, $C = D + R + U$, is a positive constant for the given cohort. The numerator, $D + \\theta U$, is a linear function of $\\theta$. Thus, $p(\\theta)$ is a linear function of $\\theta$. We can examine its rate of change by taking the derivative of $p$ with respect to $\\theta$:\n$$\\frac{dp}{d\\theta} = \\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\left( \\frac{D + \\theta U}{D + R + U} \\right) = \\frac{1}{D + R + U} \\frac{d}{d\\theta} (D + \\theta U) = \\frac{U}{D + R + U}$$\n\nSince $D, R, U$ represent counts of individuals, they are non-negative. For the problem to be non-trivial, we assume $U > 0$, as is the case with the provided data. The cohort size $C = D+R+U$ must also be positive. Therefore, the derivative $\\frac{dp}{d\\theta}$ is a positive constant:\n$$\\frac{dp}{d\\theta} = \\frac{U}{C} > 0$$\n\nThis indicates that $p(\\theta)$ is a strictly monotonically increasing function of $\\theta$. For a monotonically increasing function defined on a closed interval $[\\underline{\\theta}, \\overline{\\theta}]$, its minimum value is attained at the left endpoint of the interval ($\\theta = \\underline{\\theta}$), and its maximum value is attained at the right endpoint ($\\theta = \\overline{\\theta}$).\n\nTherefore, the sharp lower bound for the ultimate CFR, which we denote as $\\underline{p}$, corresponds to the minimum possible value of $\\theta$:\n$$\\underline{p} = p(\\underline{\\theta}) = \\frac{D + \\underline{\\theta} U}{D + R + U}$$\n\nSimilarly, the sharp upper bound for the ultimate CFR, denoted as $\\overline{p}$, corresponds to the maximum possible value of $\\theta$:\n$$\\overline{p} = p(\\overline{\\theta}) = \\frac{D + \\overline{\\theta} U}{D + R + U}$$\n\nThese bounds are \"sharp\" because the function $p(\\theta)$ is continuous, and by the Intermediate Value Theorem, for any value $p^*$ in the interval $[\\underline{p}, \\overline{p}]$, there exists a corresponding value $\\theta^*$ in $[\\underline{\\theta}, \\overline{\\theta}]$ such that $p(\\theta^*) = p^*$.\n\nNow, we apply this derivation to the specific data provided:\n- $D = 430$\n- $R = 1290$\n- $U = 430$\n- $\\underline{\\theta} = 0.12$\n- $\\overline{\\theta} = 0.28$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cohort size, $C$:\n$$C = D + R + U = 430 + 1290 + 430 = 2150$$\n\nNext, we compute the lower bound, $\\underline{p}$:\n$$\\underline{p} = \\frac{430 + (0.12)(430)}{2150} = \\frac{430 + 51.6}{2150} = \\frac{481.6}{2150}$$\n$$\\underline{p} \\approx 0.223999...$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, the lower bound is $0.2240$.\n\nFinally, we compute the upper bound, $\\overline{p}$:\n$$\\overline{p} = \\frac{430 + (0.28)(430)}{2150} = \\frac{430 + 120.4}{2150} = \\frac{550.4}{2150}$$\n$$\\overline{p} \\approx 0.256000...$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, the upper bound is $0.2560$.\n\nThe sharp partial identification bounds for the ultimate case fatality rate $p$ are therefore $[\\underline{p}, \\overline{p}]$, which are determined to be $[0.2240, 0.2560]$ for the given data.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.2240 & 0.2560\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4508426"}, {"introduction": "Even with complete follow-up data from a cohort, a calculated CFR is just an estimate, $\\hat{p} = D/C$, of a true underlying probability of death, $p$.

Derivation of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) for $p$\n\nThe problem states that the number of deaths, $D$, among $C$ confirmed cases follows a Binomial distribution, $D \\sim \\text{Binomial}(C,p)$. The probability mass function (PMF) for observing $k$ deaths is given by:\n$$\nP(D=k \\mid C, p) = \\binom{C}{k} p^k (1-p)^{C-k}\n$$\nThe likelihood function, $L(p \\mid D, C)$, is the probability of observing the specific data point $D$, viewed as a function of the parameter $p$:\n$$\nL(p \\mid D, C) = \\binom{C}{D} p^D (1-p)^{C-D}\n$$\nTo find the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) of $p$, we seek the value of $p$ that maximizes $L(p \\mid D, C)$. It is mathematically more convenient to maximize the natural logarithm of the likelihood function, the log-likelihood $\\ell(p)$, since the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function.\n$$\n\\ell(p) = \\ln(L(p \\mid D, C)) = \\ln\\left(\\binom{C}{D}\\right) + D\\ln(p) + (C-D)\\ln(1-p)\n$$\nTo find the maximum, we take the first derivative of $\\ell(p)$ with respect to $p$ and set it to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\ell}{dp} = \\frac{d}{dp} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\binom{C}{D}\\right) + D\\ln(p) + (C-D)\\ln(1-p) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\ell}{dp} = 0 + \\frac{D}{p} - \\frac{C-D}{1-p}\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find the critical point:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{p} - \\frac{C-D}{1-p} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{D}{p} = \\frac{C-D}{1-p}\n$$\n$$\nD(1-p) = p(C-D)\n$$\n$$\nD - Dp = Cp - Dp\n$$\n$$\nD = Cp\n$$\nSolving for $p$ gives the MLE, denoted as $\\hat{p}_{\\text{MLE}}$:\n$$\n\\hat{p}_{\\text{MLE}} = \\frac{D}{C}\n$$\nTo confirm this is a maximum, we check the second derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\ell}{dp^2} = \\frac{d}{dp} \\left( \\frac{D}{p} - \\frac{C-D}{1-p} \\right) = -\\frac{D}{p^2} - \\frac{C-D}{(1-p)^2}\n$$\nFor $0 < p < 1$, and given that $C \\ge D \\ge 0$, both terms are non-positive. As long as $D>0$ and $D<C$, the second derivative is strictly negative, which confirms that the critical point is a local maximum. For the edge cases $D=0$ or $D=C$, the function is monotonic and the MLE is at the boundary, which is still $D/C$.\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Clopper–Pearson (CP) Confidence Interval\n\nThe exact two-sided Clopper–Pearson confidence interval for $p$ at a confidence level of $1-\\alpha$ is constructed by inverting two one-sided hypothesis tests. For a confidence level of $0.95$, we have $1-\\alpha=0.95$, which implies $\\alpha=0.05$ and $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$.\n\nThe interval is $[p_L, p_U]$, where $p_L$ is the lower bound and $p_U$ is the upper bound.\n\nThe lower bound, $p_L$, is defined as the value of $p$ for which the probability of observing $D$ or a more extreme (larger) number of deaths is $\\alpha/2$. This is the smallest value of $p$ that is not \"too small\" to explain the observed data.\n$$\nP(X \\ge D \\mid C, p_L) = \\sum_{k=D}^{C} \\binom{C}{k} p_L^k (1-p_L)^{C-k} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\n$$\nFor the special case where $D=0$, we cannot observe a value smaller than $0$, so the probability $P(X \\ge 0) = 1$ for any $p$. The condition cannot be met. By convention and formal definition (considering the set of parameter values not rejected by the test), the lower bound is set to $p_L = 0$ when $D=0$.\n\nThe upper bound, $p_U$, is defined as the value of $p$ for which the probability of observing $D$ or a more extreme (smaller) number of deaths is $\\alpha/2$. This is the largest value of $p$ that is not \"too large\" to explain the observed data.\n$$\nP(X \\le D \\mid C, p_U) = \\sum_{k=0}^{D} \\binom{C}{k} p_U^k (1-p_U)^{C-k} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\n$$\nFor the special case where $D=C$, the probability $P(X \\le C) = 1$ for any $p$. By convention, the upper bound is set to $p_U = 1$ when $D=C$.\n\nThus, for a given confidence level $1-\\alpha=0.95$, the endpoints $p_L$ and $p_U$ for an observed number of deaths $D$ out of $C$ cases are found by solving the following equations:\n- Lower bound $p_L$: For $D>0$, $p_L$ is the solution to $\\sum_{k=D}^{C} \\binom{C}{k} p^k (1-p)^{C-k} = 0.025$. For $D=0$, $p_L=0$.\n- Upper bound $p_U$: For $D<C$, $p_U$ is the solution to $\\sum_{k=0}^{D} \\binom{C}{k} p^k (1-p)^{C-k} = 0.025$. For $D=C$, $p_U=1$.\n\nThese equations are typically solved numerically.\n\n### 3. Justification of the Binomial Model for CFR and Contrast with Attack Rate\n\n#### Appropriateness of the Binomial Model for CFR\n\nThe use of the Binomial model $D \\sim \\text{Binomial}(C,p)$ for Case Fatality Rate (CFR) rests on three core assumptions:\n1.  **Fixed number of trials ($C$)**: The model assumes a fixed, well-defined number of cases, $C$. This is appropriate for a closed cohort where all cases are identified and followed to a final outcome. It becomes problematic if case ascertainment is ongoing or if there is loss to follow-up.\n2.  **Independence of trials**: The outcome (death or survival) for each case is assumed to be independent of the outcomes of all other cases. This assumption may be violated in practice. For instance, if a new, more virulent strain affects a cluster of patients, their outcomes are correlated. Similarly, if healthcare resources (like ICU beds or ventilators) become overwhelmed, the survival probability of a patient can depend on the number of other severe cases, creating dependence.\n3.  **Constant probability of success ($p$)**: The model assumes that every confirmed case has the same probability of death, $p$. This is a strong simplification, as the true risk of death is highly dependent on patient-specific factors such as age, comorbidities, vaccination status, and socio-economic status, as well as system-level factors like quality of available care. When there is significant heterogeneity in risk among the cases, the simple Binomial model is inadequate, and a single CFR $p$ is a population average that masks this variation. More advanced models, like logistic regression, would be required to account for such covariates.\n\nIn summary, the Binomial model is a useful first approximation for CFR in a relatively homogeneous group of cases observed in a closed cohort with independent outcomes. It fails when there is significant unobserved heterogeneity, dependence between outcomes, or issues with case definition and follow-up.\n\n#### Contrast with Attack Rate ($q$)\n\nThe **attack rate ($q$)** is the proportion of a susceptible population at risk that develops a disease over a specific period. It is defined as $q = (\\text{Number of new cases}) / (\\text{Population at risk})$.\n\n**Analogous Binomial Formulation**: If one considers a closed population of size $N$ where all individuals are initially susceptible and at risk, and each individual independently contracts the disease with probability $q$, then the number of new cases, $A$, can be modeled as $A \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N, q)$. The MLE for $q$ is analogously $\\hat{q} = A/N$.\n\n**Key Differences**:\n1.  **Denominator population**: For CFR ($p$), the denominator is the number of **cases** ($C$). For attack rate ($q$), the denominator is the number of **susceptible individuals at risk** ($N$), which is typically much larger and can be harder to define precisely.\n2.  **Independence Assumption**: This is the most crucial distinction. For CFR, the independence assumption relates to the *outcomes of disease* (death/survival) among those already infected. While this can be violated, it is often more plausible than the independence assumption for attack rate. For the attack rate of an *infectious* disease, the core assumption of independent \"trials\" (i.e., individuals getting infected) is fundamentally violated by the very nature of transmission. One person's infection directly increases the risk for others they contact. The Binomial model for attack rate is therefore generally inappropriate for contagious diseases spread person-to-person. It is only suitable for situations like a point-source outbreak (e.g., foodborne illness from a single contaminated source) where all individuals are exposed to the pathogen from a common source, and infection is independent of others' status. For transmissible diseases, dynamic models (e.g., compartmental models like SIR) are necessary.\n\n### Application to Surveillance Scenario\n\nGiven the surveillance data:\n- Number of confirmed cases: $C=50$\n- Number of deaths: $D=0$\n- Confidence level: $0.95$ (so $\\alpha=0.05$ and $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$)\n\nWe are asked to compute the upper endpoint, $p_U$, of the exact two-sided Clopper-Pearson confidence interval.\n\nFrom the derivation in Part 2, for $D=0$, the lower bound is $p_L=0$. The upper bound $p_U$ is the solution to the equation:\n$$\nP(X \\le 0 \\mid C=50, p_U) = 0.025\n$$\nThe term $P(X \\le 0)$ simplifies to just $P(X=0)$, as the number of deaths cannot be negative.\nUsing the Binomial PMF:\n$$\nP(X=0) = \\binom{50}{0} p_U^0 (1-p_U)^{50-0} = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1-p_U)^{50}\n$$\nWe set this equal to $\\alpha/2$:\n$$\n(1-p_U)^{50} = 0.025\n$$\nNow, we solve for $p_U$:\n$$\n1-p_U = (0.025)^{1/50}\n$$\n$$\np_U = 1 - (0.025)^{1/50}\n$$\nWe now compute the numerical value:\n$$\np_U = 1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{50}\\ln(0.025)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(0.025) \\approx -3.68887945411\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\ln(0.025)}{50} \\approx -0.07377758908\n$$\n$$\n(0.025)^{1/50} = \\exp(-0.07377758908) \\approx 0.92887518\n$$\n$$\np_U = 1 - 0.92887518 \\approx 0.07112482\n$$\nRounding this final numeric result to four significant figures yields $0.07112$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.07112}\n$$", "id": "4508401"}]}
