A simple random sample of $n=500$ adults is selected, and $x=65$ are observed to have the risk factor. Assume independent Bernoulli sampling so that the count of adults with the risk factor follows a binomial distribution with parameter $p$, the true population proportion.\n\nStarting from the core definitions of the sample proportion and the variance of a binomially distributed count, derive an estimator for the population proportion and its estimated standard error based on large-sample reasoning. Then compute the numerical values of the sample proportion $\\hat{p}$ and its estimated standard error, expressing both as decimals. Finally, provide a brief interpretation of the precision of this estimate in the context of public health planning, referencing how the estimated standard error informs uncertainty in resource allocation decisions.\n\nRound both the sample proportion and the estimated standard error to four significant figures.

By construction, $X$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$, written $X \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n,p)$, where $p$ is the true population proportion.\n\nBy definition, the sample proportion is the fraction of individuals in the sample exhibiting the characteristic of interest. The estimator for the population proportion is\n$$\n\\hat{p} = \\frac{X}{n}.\n$$\nFor a binomial random variable, a well-tested fact is that\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X] = np \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathrm{Var}(X) = np(1-p).\n$$\nBecause $\\hat{p} = X/n$, the variance of the sample proportion can be obtained via the variance scaling property:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{p}) = \\mathrm{Var}\\!\\left(\\frac{X}{n}\\right) = \\frac{1}{n^{2}} \\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}.\n$$\nThe standard error of an estimator is the square root of its variance.

A common large-sample approximation uses the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to state that $\\hat{p}$ is approximately normally distributed around $p$ with standard deviation $\\sqrt{p(1-p)/n}$, which we estimate by $\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{p})$.

This level of precision suggests that, for planning purposes, the true prevalence is likely within a band approximately $3 \\times 10^{-2}$ wide around $0.13$. In resource allocation, such precision allows planners to anticipate the scale of need with moderate confidence; for example, in a target population of size $N$, the estimated number needing intervention would be $0.13N$, with an uncertainty on the order of $0.03N$. If narrower uncertainty is required (e.g., for tight budgeting or logistics), increasing $n$ would reduce $\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{p})$ according to the relationship $\\sqrt{p(1-p)/n}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}0.1300 & 0.01504\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4541298"}, {"introduction": "When comparing exposed and unexposed groups, epidemiologists frequently use the Risk Ratio ($RR$) and the Odds Ratio ($OR$) as measures of association.
