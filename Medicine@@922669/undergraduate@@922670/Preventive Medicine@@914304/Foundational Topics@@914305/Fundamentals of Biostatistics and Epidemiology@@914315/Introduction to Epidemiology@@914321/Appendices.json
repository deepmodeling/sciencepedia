Specifically, conditional on the observed history up to the time of censoring, the hazard of the event after censoring would have been the same as for those remaining under observation.

Computation of the Crude Odds Ratio ($OR$)**\n\nThe odds of disease are defined as the ratio of the number of individuals who develop the disease to the number of individuals who do not.\n\nThe odds of dermatitis in the exposed group ($Odds_1$) is:\n$$ Odds_1 = \\frac{\\text{Number of exposed cases}}{\\text{Number of exposed non-cases}} = \\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{84}{476} $$\n\nThe odds of dermatitis in the unexposed group ($Odds_0$) is:\n$$ Odds_0 = \\frac{\\text{Number of unexposed cases}}{\\text{Number of unexposed non-cases}} = \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{45}{855} $$\n\nThe odds ratio ($OR$) is the ratio of the odds of disease in the exposed group to the odds of disease in the unexposed group.\n$$ OR = \\frac{Odds_1}{Odds_0} = \\frac{a/b}{c/d} = \\frac{ad}{bc} $$\n\nSubstituting the numerical values from the data:\n$$ OR = \\frac{84 \\times 855}{476 \\times 45} = \\frac{71820}{21420} \\approx 3.352941... $$\n\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the crude odds ratio is $3.353$.\n\n**2. Mathematical Conditions for $OR \\approx RR$**\n\nThe risk (or cumulative incidence) is the probability of developing the disease over a specified time period.\nThe risk in the exposed group ($R_1$) is:\n$$ R_1 = \\frac{a}{a+b} $$\nThe risk in the unexposed group ($R_0$) is:\n$$ R_0 = \\frac{c}{c+d} $$\nThe risk ratio ($RR$) is the ratio of these two risks:\n$$ RR = \\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{a/(a+b)}{c/(c+d)} $$\nThe relationship between odds and risk for any group is $Odds = \\frac{Risk}{1-Risk}$.\nTherefore, we can express the odds ratio in terms of risks:\n$$ OR = \\frac{Odds_1}{Odds_0} = \\frac{R_1/(1-R_1)}{R_0/(1-R_0)} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_0}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1-R_0}{1-R_1}\\right) = RR \\times \\left(\\frac{1-R_0}{1-R_1}\\right) $$\nFor the odds ratio ($OR$) to approximate the risk ratio ($RR$), the correction factor $\\frac{1-R_0}{1-R_1}$ must be approximately equal to $1$.\n$$ \\frac{1-R_0}{1-R_1} \\approx 1 $$\nThis condition is met when the disease is rare. Specifically, if the risk of the disease is very small in both the unexposed and exposed groups, then $R_0 \\ll 1$ and $R_1 \\ll 1$. In this case, the denominators $(1-R_0)$ and $(1-R_1)$ are both close to $1$, making their ratio also close to $1$.\n$$ \\text{If } R_0 \\to 0 \\text{ and } R_1 \\to 0, \\text{ then } (1-R_0) \\to 1 \\text{ and } (1-R_1) \\to 1. $$\n$$ \\implies \\frac{1-R_0}{1-R_1} \\to \\frac{1}{1} = 1 $$\nThus, the mathematical condition under which the odds ratio approximates the risk ratio is that the outcome is rare in all groups being compared. This is often referred to as the \"rare disease assumption\".\n\n**3. Non-Collapsibility of the Odds Ratio**\n\nCollapsibility refers to the property of a measure of association where its crude (marginal) value is a weighted average of the stratum-specific (conditional) values. The risk ratio and risk difference are collapsible. The odds ratio is not; it is non-collapsible.\n\nNon-collapsibility means that the marginal odds ratio is not a simple weighted average of the conditional odds ratios, even in the complete absence of confounding. Confounding is present when a crude measure of association differs from a common conditional measure, and this difference is due to the stratifying variable being associated with both the exposure and the outcome.\n\nWith the odds ratio, a difference between the crude $OR$ and a common stratum-specific $OR$ can occur even if the stratifying variable is not a confounder (i.e., it is not associated with the exposure within levels of the outcome). This is a purely mathematical property of the $OR$. In general, if the stratum-specific odds ratios are constant across strata (i.e., no effect modification) and greater than $1$, the marginal (crude) odds ratio will be attenuated towards the null value of $1$. That is, $1 \\le OR_{crude} < OR_{conditional}$. Conversely, if the conditional odds ratio is less than $1$, the crude odds ratio will be larger (closer to $1$), i.e., $OR_{conditional} < OR_{crude} \\le 1$. The crude and conditional $OR$s will only be equal if the association is null ($OR=1$) or if the stratifying variable is not associated with the outcome.\n\nThis non-collapsibility complicates interpretation because it decouples the concepts of confounding and the difference between crude and adjusted estimates. When using risk ratios, if $RR_{crude} \\neq RR_{adjusted}$, one can conclude there is confounding. When using odds ratios, $OR_{crude} \\neq OR_{adjusted}$ does not, by itself, imply confounding; the difference may be due to the non-collapsibility property alone. This means the magnitude of the association measured by the odds ratio appears to change simply by adjusting for a non-confounding variable. Consequently, the marginal (population-averaged) effect and the conditional (stratum-specific) effect are fundamentally different parameters when measured by the odds ratio, which can lead to interpretational challenges when deciding whether to report a crude or an adjusted estimate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.353}$$", "id": "4541737"}, {"introduction": "A simple comparison between an exposed and an unexposed group can sometimes be misleading due to the influence of other variables, known as confounders.
