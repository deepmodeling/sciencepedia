This exercise guides you through calculating this fundamental metric from first principles. By working with raw data on deaths and population size, you will solidify your understanding of a rate as a measure of intensity—the frequency of an event over a given period of population-time [@problem_id:4547639].", "problem": "An urban health department aims to report the crude mortality rate for a single calendar year as a measure of death intensity in the population. Use only the following core definitions: a rate is the number of events per unit of person-time, and for a one-year reporting period in a relatively stable population, the mid-year population approximates the average population at risk so that one person contributes approximately one person-year over the year. The department recorded $D = 3{,}834$ deaths during the year, and the mid-year population was $N = 456{,}000$ persons.\n\nStarting from these definitions and reasoning from first principles, derive the quantity that represents the crude mortality rate per $100{,}000$ person-years for this one-year period, and compute its numerical value.

The definitions provided for a rate and the approximation for person-time are standard conventions in epidemiology and public health. All necessary data are provided, and the task is a direct application of these principles.\n\nWe begin by establishing the fundamental definition of a mortality rate. As stated, a rate is the number of events occurring over a specified period divided by the total person-time at risk during that period. In this context, the event is death. Let $R$ denote the crude mortality rate.\n\n$$R = \\frac{\\text{Number of events}}{\\text{Total person-time at risk}}$$\n\nThe number of events, which are deaths, is given as $D = 3834$.\n\nThe total person-time at risk must be calculated. The problem states that for a one-year reporting period in a relatively stable population, the mid-year population can be used to approximate the average population at risk. Each individual in this average population is assumed to contribute one person-year of observation time. The mid-year population is given as $N = 456000$ persons.\n\nTherefore, the total person-time at risk for the one-year period is approximated as:\n$$\\text{Total person-time} \\approx N \\times 1 \\, \\text{year} = 456000 \\, \\text{person-years}$$\n\nUsing this approximation, the crude mortality rate, $R$, which represents the death intensity per person-year, can be expressed as the ratio of the total number of deaths, $D$, to the total person-years at risk, approximated by $N$.\n\n$$R = \\frac{D}{N}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R = \\frac{3834}{456000} \\, \\frac{\\text{deaths}}{\\text{person-year}}$$\n\nThis quantity $R$ is the death intensity, representing the expected number of deaths per person per year.\n\nThe problem requires the rate to be expressed per $100000$ person-years. To convert the rate from per person-year to per $100000$ person-years, we must multiply by a scaling factor of $100000$. Let this scaled rate be denoted by $R_{100k}$.\n\n$$R_{100k} = R \\times 100000 = \\frac{D}{N} \\times 100000$$\n\nWe now substitute the numerical values to compute the final rate:\n$$R_{100k} = \\frac{3834}{456000} \\times 100000$$\n$$R_{100k} = \\frac{383400000}{456000}$$\n$$R_{100k} = \\frac{38340}{456}$$\n$$R_{100k} \\approx 840.78947368...$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four digits of the result are $8$, $4$, $0$, and $7$. The fifth digit is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant digit. The digit $7$ becomes $8$.\n\n$$R_{100k} \\approx 840.8$$\n\nThe interpretation of this quantity is that for every $100000$ person-years of time experienced by the population, there were approximately $840.8$ deaths during the specified calendar year. Alternatively, in a hypothetical stable population of exactly $100000$ people, one would expect approximately $840.8$ deaths over the course of one year.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution will be derived below.\n\n### I. Calculation of Crude Mortality Rates (CMR)\n\nA crude mortality rate is the total number of deaths divided by the total population, conventionally expressed per $1{,}000$ or $100{,}000$ persons. The problem specifies per $1{,}000$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of deaths ($D$) in each age stratum ($i$) for each city ($j$) using the formula $D_{j,i} = N_{j,i} \\times \\frac{m_{j,i}}{1000}$.\n\n**City Delta:**\n*   Deaths in adults (A): $D_{\\Delta, A} = 95{,}000 \\times \\frac{3}{1{,}000} = 285$\n*   Deaths in seniors (S): $D_{\\Delta, S} = 5{,}000 \\times \\frac{30}{1{,}000} = 150$\n*   Total deaths in Delta: $D_{\\Delta, T} = D_{\\Delta, A} + D_{\\Delta, S} = 285 + 150 = 435$\n*   Crude Mortality Rate for Delta: $CMR_{\\Delta} = \\frac{D_{\\Delta, T}}{N_{\\Delta, T}} \\times 1{,}000 = \\frac{435}{100{,}000} \\times 1{,}000 = 4.35$ per $1{,}000$ persons.\n\n**City Sigma:**\n*   Deaths in adults (A): $D_{\\Sigma, A} = 70{,}000 \\times \\frac{2}{1{,}000} = 140$\n*   Deaths in seniors (S): $D_{\\Sigma, S} = 30{,}000 \\times \\frac{25}{1{,}000} = 750$\n*   Total deaths in Sigma: $D_{\\Sigma, T} = D_{\\Sigma, A} + D_{\\Sigma, S} = 140 + 750 = 890$\n*   Crude Mortality Rate for Sigma: $CMR_{\\Sigma} = \\frac{D_{\\Sigma, T}}{N_{\\Sigma, T}} \\times 1{,}000 = \\frac{890}{100{,}000} \\times 1{,}000 = 8.90$ per $1{,}000$ persons.\n\n### II. Calculation of Age-Adjusted Mortality Rates (AAMR)\n\nDirect age adjustment requires a standard population. As instructed, we combine the populations of both cities.\n\n**Standard Population:**\n*   Standard population of adults: $N_{Std, A} = N_{\\Delta, A} + N_{\\Sigma, A} = 95{,}000 + 70{,}000 = 165{,}000$\n*   Standard population of seniors: $N_{Std, S} = N_{\\Delta, S} + N_{\\Sigma, S} = 5{,}000 + 30{,}000 = 35{,}000$\n*   Total standard population: $N_{Std, T} = N_{Std, A} + N_{Std, S} = 165{,}000 + 35{,}000 = 200{,}000$\n\nNext, we find the weights ($w_i$), which are the proportions of each age group in the standard population.\n*   Weight for adults: $w_A = \\frac{N_{Std, A}}{N_{Std, T}} = \\frac{165{,}000}{200{,}000} = 0.825$\n*   Weight for seniors: $w_S = \\frac{N_{Std, S}}{N_{Std, T}} = \\frac{35{,}000}{200{,}000} = 0.175$\nThe weights sum to $0.825 + 0.175 = 1.0$.\n\nThe age-adjusted mortality rate ($AAMR$) is the weighted average of the age-specific mortality rates ($m_i$), where the rates are expressed per $1{,}000$.\n$AAMR = \\sum_i m_i \\cdot w_i$\n\n**AAMR for City Delta:**\n*   $AAMR_{\\Delta} = (m_{\\Delta, A} \\times w_A) + (m_{\\Delta, S} \\times w_S) = (3 \\times 0.825) + (30 \\times 0.175)$\n*   $AAMR_{\\Delta} = 2.475 + 5.25 = 7.725$ per $1{,}000$ persons.\n\n**AAMR for City Sigma:**\n*   $AAMR_{\\Sigma} = (m_{\\Sigma, A} \\times w_A) + (m_{\\Sigma, S} \\times w_S) = (2 \\times 0.825) + (25 \\times 0.175)$\n*   $AAMR_{\\Sigma} = 1.65 + 4.375 = 6.025$ per $1{,}000$ persons.\n\n### III. Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. City Delta’s crude mortality rate is lower than City Sigma’s, even though within each age stratum City Delta’s age-specific mortality rate is higher.**\n\n*   From our calculations, $CMR_{\\Delta} = 4.35$ per $1{,}000$ and $CMR_{\\Sigma} = 8.90$ per $1{,}000$. Thus, $CMR_{\\Delta}  CMR_{\\Sigma}$.\n*   From the givens, for adults, $m_{\\Delta, A} = 3  m_{\\Sigma, A} = 2$. For seniors, $m_{\\Delta, S} = 30  m_{\\Sigma, S} = 25$.\n*   This statement accurately describes the situation, which is an instance of Simpson's paradox. The confounding variable is age structure: City Delta has a much younger population ($95\\%$ adults) than City Sigma ($70\\%$ adults), and since adults have a much lower mortality rate than seniors, this compositional difference drives Delta's crude rate down.\n*   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. After direct age adjustment to the combined standard population, City Delta’s adjusted mortality rate exceeds City Sigma’s, reversing the crude comparison.**\n\n*   The crude comparison is $CMR_{\\Delta} (4.35)  CMR_{\\Sigma} (8.90)$.\n*   Our calculation of adjusted rates gives $AAMR_{\\Delta} = 7.725$ and $AAMR_{\\Sigma} = 6.025$.\n*   The adjusted comparison is $AAMR_{\\Delta}  AAMR_{\\Sigma}$.\n*   The inequality has indeed reversed, which is the purpose of adjustment: to reveal the underlying differences in age-specific rates by controlling for the confounding effect of age distribution.\n*   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Decomposing the crude rate difference into a composition effect (due to age structure) and a rate effect (due to stratum-specific mortality), the composition effect is approximately $+6.25$ per $1{,}000$ and the rate effect approximately $-1.70$ per $1{,}000$, summing to the observed crude rate difference.**\n\nThe crude rate difference to be decomposed is $CMR_{\\Sigma} - CMR_{\\Delta} = 8.90 - 4.35 = 4.55$ per $1,000$. Let's test the values in the option. Summing them gives $6.25 - 1.70 = 4.55$, which matches the total difference. Now we must verify the individual components using a standard decomposition method, such as the Kitagawa method.\n\nLet City Sigma be population 1 and City Delta be population 2.\n$w_{\\Delta,A} = 0.95, w_{\\Delta,S} = 0.05$.\n$w_{\\Sigma,A} = 0.70, w_{\\Sigma,S} = 0.30$.\n$m_{\\Delta,A} = 3, m_{\\Delta,S} = 30$.\n$m_{\\Sigma,A} = 2, m_{\\Sigma,S} = 25$.\n\nThe **Rate Effect** (difference due to rates, averaged over compositions):\n*   Rate Effect $= \\sum_i (m_{\\Sigma, i} - m_{\\Delta, i}) \\left(\\frac{w_{\\Sigma, i} + w_{\\Delta, i}}{2}\\right)$\n*   $= (m_{\\Sigma, A} - m_{\\Delta, A})\\left(\\frac{w_{\\Sigma, A} + w_{\\Delta, A}}{2}\\right) + (m_{\\Sigma, S} - m_{\\Delta, S})\\left(\\frac{w_{\\Sigma, S} + w_{\\Delta, S}}{2}\\right)$\n*   $= (2 - 3)\\left(\\frac{0.70 + 0.95}{2}\\right) + (25 - 30)\\left(\\frac{0.30 + 0.05}{2}\\right)$\n*   $= (-1)(0.825) + (-5)(0.175) = -0.825 - 0.875 = -1.70$ per $1{,}000$.\n\nThe **Composition Effect** (difference due to population structure, averaged over rates):\n*   Composition Effect $= \\sum_i (w_{\\Sigma, i} - w_{\\Delta, i}) \\left(\\frac{m_{\\Sigma, i} + m_{\\Delta, i}}{2}\\right)$\n*   $= (w_{\\Sigma, A} - w_{\\Delta, A})\\left(\\frac{m_{\\Sigma, A} + m_{\\Delta, A}}{2}\\right) + (w_{\\Sigma, S} - w_{\\Delta, S})\\left(\\frac{m_{\\Sigma, S} + m_{\\Delta, S}}{2}\\right)$\n*   $= (0.70 - 0.95)\\left(\\frac{2 + 3}{2}\\right) + (0.30 - 0.05)\\left(\\frac{25 + 30}{2}\\right)$\n*   $= (-0.25)(2.5) + (0.25)(27.5) = -0.625 + 6.875 = +6.25$ per $1{,}000$.\n\nThe calculated components perfectly match the values given in the option.\n*   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. The entire crude rate difference is explained by differences in age-specific mortality rates alone; age composition contributes approximately $0$.**\n\n*   This statement is directly contradicted by our findings for option C. The rate effect is $-1.70$ per $1{,}000$, and the composition effect is $+6.25$ per $1{,}000$.\n*   Not only does the age composition effect not contribute $0$, it is the larger of the two components and is primarily responsible for the overall crude rate difference being positive ($CMR_{\\Sigma}  CMR_{\\Delta}$). The rate effect, by itself, would have made City Sigma's rate lower than City Delta's.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Under indirect standardization using the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR), City Delta would necessarily be judged as performing better than City Sigma because its crude mortality rate is lower.**\n\n*   Indirect standardization compares observed deaths to expected deaths. The Standardized Mortality Ratio ($SMR$) is $\\frac{\\text{Observed Deaths}}{\\text{Expected Deaths}}$. An $SMR  1$ implies higher mortality than the standard, while an $SMR  1$ implies lower mortality.\n*   Let's calculate the SMR for City Delta, using City Sigma's age-specific rates as the standard.\n    *   Observed Deaths in Delta: $D_{\\Delta, T} = 435$.\n    *   Expected Deaths in Delta (if it had Sigma's rates): $E_{\\Delta} = (N_{\\Delta, A} \\times \\frac{m_{\\Sigma, A}}{1000}) + (N_{\\Delta, S} \\times \\frac{m_{\\Sigma, S}}{1000})$\n    *   $E_{\\Delta} = (95{,}000 \\times \\frac{2}{1000}) + (5{,}000 \\times \\frac{25}{1000}) = 190 + 125 = 315$.\n    *   $SMR_{\\Delta} = \\frac{435}{315} \\approx 1.38$.\n*   Since $SMR_{\\Delta}  1.0$, City Delta experienced more deaths than would be expected given its age structure if it had Sigma's mortality rates. This indicates Delta has a higher underlying mortality risk (i.e., performs worse) than Sigma.\n*   This conclusion matches the result from direct standardization. The statement in option E claims the opposite, that Delta would be judged as performing better. The reasoning provided (\"because its crude mortality rate is lower\") is fallacious and is the very reason standardization methods are employed.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "4547601"}]}
