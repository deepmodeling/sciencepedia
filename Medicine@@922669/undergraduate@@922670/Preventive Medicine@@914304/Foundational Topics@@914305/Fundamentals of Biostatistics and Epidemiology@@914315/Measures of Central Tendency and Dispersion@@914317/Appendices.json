The data provided are self-consistent and sufficient for the required calculations. The problem is well-posed, as it has a unique and meaningful solution. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe set of observations consists of three counts, which we denote as a sample $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$, where $x_1 = 8$, $x_2 = 10$, and $x_3 = 12$. The number of observations is $n = 3$.\n\nThe task is to compute the coefficient of variation ($CV$), defined as:\n$$\nCV = \\frac{s}{\\bar{x}}\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{x}$ is the arithmetic mean of the sample and $s$ is the sample standard deviation.\n\n**1. Calculate the Arithmetic Mean ($\\bar{x}$)**\nThe arithmetic mean is defined as the sum of the observations divided by the number of observations.\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{8 + 10 + 12}{3} = \\frac{30}{3} = 10\n$$\nThe mean count of fields with identified rosettes is $10$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Sample Standard Deviation ($s$)**\nThe sample standard deviation is the square root of the sample variance ($s^2$). The sample variance is defined as the sum of the squared deviations from the mean, divided by $n-1$.\n$$\ns = \\sqrt{s^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\n$$\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the squared deviations from the mean:\n- For $x_1 = 8$: $(x_1 - \\bar{x})^2 = (8 - 10)^2 = (-2)^2 = 4$.\n- For $x_2 = 10$: $(x_2 - \\bar{x})^2 = (10 - 10)^2 = (0)^2 = 0$.\n- For $x_3 = 12$: $(x_3 - \\bar{x})^2 = (12 - 10)^2 = (2)^2 = 4$.\n\nThe sum of these squared deviations is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{3} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 = 4 + 0 + 4 = 8\n$$\nNow, we calculate the sample variance, using the denominator $n-1 = 3-1 = 2$:\n$$\ns^2 = \\frac{8}{2} = 4\n$$\nThe sample standard deviation is the square root of the variance:\n$$\ns = \\sqrt{4} = 2\n$$\nThe spread of the counts, as measured by the sample standard deviation, is $2$.\n\n**3.

It involves the standard, formal definition of the finite-sample breakdown point applied to two fundamental statistical estimators. The context provided is a realistic application in environmental science. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe finite-sample breakdown point is defined as the smallest proportion of data, $m/n$, that can be corrupted to drive an estimator's value to be arbitrarily large or small. Let the original dataset be $X = \\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\}$. A contaminated dataset $X'$ is formed by replacing $m$ of these points with arbitrary values.\n\n1.  **Sample Mean**\n    The sample mean, $\\bar{x}$, of a dataset of size $n$ is defined as:\n    $$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i $$\n    Let us replace a single data point, say $x_1$, with an arbitrary value $y$. The new dataset is $X' = \\{y, x_2, x_3, \\ldots, x_n\\}$. The new sample mean, $\\bar{x}'$, is:\n    $$ \\bar{x}' = \\frac{1}{n} \\left( y + \\sum_{i=2}^{n} x_i \\right) = \\frac{y}{n} + \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=2}^{n} x_i $$\n    The sum $\\sum_{i=2}^{n} x_i$ represents a fixed, finite value based on the $n-1$ original, uncontaminated data points. As the arbitrary value $y$ is allowed to approach infinity ($y \\to \\infty$) or negative infinity ($y \\to -\\infty$), the term $y/n$ also approaches infinity or negative infinity, respectively. Consequently, the new mean $\\bar{x}'$ becomes unbounded.\n    \n    Since replacing just one observation is sufficient to drive the sample mean to any value, the minimal number of contaminated observations is $m=1$.\n    The finite-sample breakdown point for the sample mean is therefore $m/n = 1/n$.\n    \n    In the limit as the sample size $n$ grows large ($n \\to \\infty$), this fraction approaches zero:\n    $$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} = 0 $$\n    This indicates that the sample mean is highly non-robust, as an infinitesimally small fraction of the data can have a disproportionately large effect on its value.\n\n2.  **Sample Median**\n    For a dataset of size $n$, the sample median is the value that separates the lower half from the upper half of the sorted data. Let the sorted dataset be $x_{(1)} \\le x_{(2)} \\le \\ldots \\le x_{(n)}$.\n    The problem specifies $n=101$, which is an odd number. For an odd sample size $n = 2k+1$, the median is uniquely defined as the observation at rank $k+1$, i.e., $x_{(k+1)}$. For $n=101$, we have $101 = 2(50) + 1$, so $k=50$. The median is the value at rank $50+1=51$ in the sorted data.\n\n    To make the median unbounded (e.g., drive it to $+\\infty$), we must replace a certain number of data points, $m$, with an arbitrarily large value $y$. These $m$ contaminated points will occupy the highest ranks in the new sorted dataset. The remaining $n-m$ points are the original, uncontaminated data. For the median to be driven to $+\\infty$, its position in the sorted list must be occupied by one of the contaminated points.\n    \n    The median is at rank $k+1=51$. This means that if we can ensure there are fewer than $51$ original data points remaining in the sample, the value at rank $51$ must be one of the contaminated points. This condition is expressed as:\n    $$ n - m < k+1 $$\n    Solving for $m$:\n    $$ m > n - (k+1) $$\n    Substituting $n=101$ and $k=50$:\n    $$ m > 101 - (50+1) = 101 - 51 = 50 $$\n    The smallest integer $m$ that satisfies $m > 50$ is $m=51$.\n    \n    Therefore, the minimal number of contaminated observations required to make the sample median unbounded for a dataset of size $n=101$ is $m=51$.\n    \n    In general, for any sample size $n$, the minimal number of points is $m = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor + 1$. For $n=101$, this gives $m = \\lfloor 101/2 \\rfloor + 1 = 50 + 1 = 51$. The corresponding finite-sample breakdown point is $m/n = 51/101$.\n\n3.  **Interpretation for Preventive Medicine**\n    The breakdown point quantifies an estimator's robustness to outliers.\n    \n    For the **sample mean**, the breakdown point is $1/n$ (here, $1/101 \\approx 0.01$). This extremely low value implies that a single extreme outlier—such as a single malfunctioning air quality monitor reporting a physically impossible concentration—can completely corrupt the estimate of the average exposure level for the entire network of $101$ sites. The resulting mean would be misleading and not representative of the typical ambient conditions, potentially leading to flawed risk assessments and inappropriate public health responses.\n    \n    For the **sample median**, the breakdown point is $51/101 \\approx 0.505$ (or about $50\\%$). This is the highest possible breakdown point for an equivariant estimator and signifies exceptional robustness. It means that up to $50$ of the $101$ monitoring sites could report arbitrarily erroneous data, and the median would still provide a reliable, bounded estimate of the central tendency based on the majority of \"good\" data. In the context of environmental exposure assessment, where data can be noisy and subject to localized spikes or instrument errors, the median is a far superior metric for summarizing typical conditions for risk communication. It is resilient to a large fraction of outliers, ensuring the summary statistic reflects the central experience rather than being skewed by extreme, and possibly non-representative, values.\n\nThe final numerical answer required is the finite-sample breakdown point for the sample median when $n=101$, expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.\nThis value is $m/n = 51/101$.\n$51 \\div 101 \\approx 0.504950495...$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.5050$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5050}$$", "id": "4545935"}, {"introduction": "Measures of central tendency are powerful but can be profoundly misleading if underlying differences between groups are ignored.

It is free of ambiguity and subjectivity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\n**1. Computation of Crude Overall Means**\n\nThe crude overall mean for each group (Control and Intervention) is the weighted average of the stratum-specific means, where the weights are the proportions of the group's total sample size found in each stratum. This is equivalent to calculating the mean from the total sum of measurements divided by the total number of subjects.\n\n**Control Group:**\nThe total sample size is $N_C = n_{LC} + n_{HC} = 100 + 900 = 1000$.\nThe crude mean, $\\bar{x}_{C,crude}$, is:\n$$ \\bar{x}_{C,crude} = \\frac{n_{LC} \\cdot \\bar{x}_{LC} + n_{HC} \\cdot \\bar{x}_{HC}}{N_C} = \\frac{(100)(80) + (900)(50)}{1000} $$\n$$ \\bar{x}_{C,crude} = \\frac{8000 + 45000}{1000} = \\frac{53000}{1000} = 53 $$\n\n**Intervention Group:**\nThe total sample size is $N_I = n_{LI} + n_{HI} = 900 + 100 = 1000$.\nThe crude mean, $\\bar{x}_{I,crude}$, is:\n$$ \\bar{x}_{I,crude} = \\frac{n_{LI} \\cdot \\bar{x}_{LI} + n_{HI} \\cdot \\bar{x}_{HI}}{N_I} = \\frac{(900)(70) + (100)(45)}{1000} $$\n$$ \\bar{x}_{I,crude} = \\frac{63000 + 4500}{1000} = \\frac{67500}{1000} = 67.5 $$\n\n**Crude Comparison:**\nComparing the crude means, $\\bar{x}_{I,crude} = 67.5$ is greater than $\\bar{x}_{C,crude} = 53$. A naive interpretation of the crude data suggests that the intervention group has a higher average particulate exposure, implying the intervention is harmful.\n\n**2. Computation of Standardized Means**\n\nDirect standardization adjusts the group means to what they would be if the groups had the same underlying population structure. Here, the standard population is defined as $50\\%$ low SES and $50\\%$ high SES. The weights are therefore $w_L = 0.5$ and $w_H = 0.5$.\n\n**Control Group (Standardized):**\nThe standardized mean, $\\bar{x}_{C,std}$, is calculated using the stratum-specific means of the control group with the standard population weights:\n$$ \\bar{x}_{C,std} = w_L \\cdot \\bar{x}_{LC} + w_H \\cdot \\bar{x}_{HC} = (0.5)(80) + (0.5)(50) $$\n$$ \\bar{x}_{C,std} = 40 + 25 = 65 $$\n\n**Intervention Group (Standardized):**\nThe standardized mean, $\\bar{x}_{I,std}$, is calculated using the stratum-specific means of the intervention group with the same standard population weights:\n$$ \\bar{x}_{I,std} = w_L \\cdot \\bar{x}_{LI} + w_H \\cdot \\bar{x}_{HI} = (0.5)(70) + (0.5)(45) $$\n$$ \\bar{x}_{I,std} = 35 + 22.5 = 57.5 $$\n\n**Standardized Comparison:**\nComparing the standardized means, $\\bar{x}_{I,std} = 57.5$ is less than $\\bar{x}_{C,std} = 65$. This adjusted comparison suggests that the intervention is beneficial, reducing average particulate exposure.\n\n**3. Interpretation of the Reversal (Simpson's Paradox)**\n\nThe analysis reveals a reversal of the association.\n- **Within Strata:** In both the low SES stratum ($70 < 80$) and the high SES stratum ($45 < 50$), the intervention group has a lower mean exposure than the control group. The intervention is consistently beneficial within each stratum.\n- **Crude (Overall):** The crude mean for the intervention group ($67.5$) is higher than for the control group ($53$), suggesting a harmful effect.\n\nThis contradiction is a classic example of **confounding**, often referred to as Simpson's Paradox. The variable SES is a confounder because it is associated with both the exposure (intervention status) and the outcome (particulate concentration).\n- **SES and Outcome:** Low SES households have inherently higher exposure levels than high SES households (e.g., $80$ vs $50$ in controls).\n- **SES and Exposure:** The group compositions are severely imbalanced with respect to SES. The intervention group is predominantly low SES ($900/1000 = 90\\%$), the stratum with higher baseline exposure. The control group is predominantly high SES ($900/1000 = 90\\%$), the stratum with lower baseline exposure.\n\nThe high crude mean in the intervention group is driven by the fact that it is mostly composed of high-exposure (low SES) individuals. Conversely, the low crude mean in the control group is due to its composition of mostly low-exposure (high SES) individuals. This compositional difference creates a spurious association that masks the true, beneficial effect of the intervention.\n\n**Standardization** resolves this paradox by re-weighting the stratum-specific means to a common standard SES distribution. This procedure removes the effect of the confounding variable (SES) from the comparison, revealing the underlying association between the intervention and the outcome, which aligns with the consistent findings within each stratum.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The crude overall mean exposure is lower in the intervention group than in the control group, so no reversal is present; standardization would not change the interpretation, and any observed differences are due to random dispersion.**\nOur calculation shows the crude mean is higher in the intervention group ($67.5$) than the control group ($53$). The premise of this option is factually incorrect. A reversal is clearly present.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The crude overall mean exposure is higher in the intervention group than in the control group due to differing SES composition; direct standardization to $50\\%$ low SES and $50\\%$ high SES yields a lower standardized mean in the intervention group, aligning with the within-stratum reductions and resolving the reversal.**\nThis statement accurately reflects all parts of our analysis. It correctly states that the crude mean is higher in the intervention group, attributes this to the differing SES composition (confounding), correctly describes the result of standardization (a lower mean in the intervention group), and correctly interprets this as resolving the reversal and aligning with the within-stratum effects.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The reversal arises because means are unduly influenced by dispersion; replacing means with medians, without any standardization, would eliminate the reversal even with the observed SES imbalance.**\nThe reversal is due to confounding, a structural issue related to group composition, not a statistical artifact of the mean's sensitivity to dispersion or outliers. Simply replacing the mean with the median without addressing the confounding via standardization would not solve the problem. The weighted median would still be subject to the same compositional bias.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The appropriate resolution is to weight strata by the inverse of their within-stratum variance rather than by a standard population; this would make the crude mean equal to the stratum-specific means, so standardization is unnecessary.**\nInverse variance weighting is a technique for meta-analysis to obtain a pooled estimate of an *effect measure* with minimal variance. It is not the method for adjusting a group's overall mean for confounding. Direct standardization, which uses a standard population's structure, is the appropriate method as described. Furthermore, no weighting scheme can make a single summary number (the crude mean) equal to multiple different numbers (the stratum-specific means).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The reversal indicates true effect modification by SES, making any overall summary invalid; standardization would inappropriately mask heterogeneity and should not be used in this setting.**\nThe problem does exhibit effect modification, as the magnitude of the intervention's effect differs by stratum (a reduction of $10$ in low SES vs. a reduction of $5$ in high SES). However, the *reversal* of the effect's direction in the crude analysis is caused by confounding, not effect modification. While reporting stratum-specific effects is important in the presence of effect modification, it does not invalidate the use of standardization to provide a summary measure adjusted for confounding. Standardization appropriately answers the question, \"What would the overall effect be if the confounder's distribution were held constant between groups?\" It doesn't \"inappropriately mask\" heterogeneity; it provides a specific type of summary. The primary phenomenon to explain here is the reversal, which is due to confounding.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4545942"}]}
