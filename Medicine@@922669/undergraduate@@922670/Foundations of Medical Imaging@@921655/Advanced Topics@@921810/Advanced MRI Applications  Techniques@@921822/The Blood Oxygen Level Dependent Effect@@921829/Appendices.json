This derivation is based on the principle of conservation of mass, specifically the Fick principle as applied to oxygen consumption in the brain.\n\nThe rate at which oxygen is delivered to a unit mass of brain tissue via arterial blood is the product of the blood flow rate per unit mass, $CBF$, and the concentration of oxygen in arterial blood, $C_{aO_2}$.\nRate of oxygen supply per unit tissue mass $= CBF \\cdot C_{aO_2}$.\n\nSimilarly, the rate at which oxygen exits the tissue via venous blood is the product of $CBF$ and the venous oxygen content, $C_{vO_2}$.\nRate of oxygen removal per unit tissue mass $= CBF \\cdot C_{vO_2}$.\n\nThe rate at which oxygen is consumed by the tissue per unit mass, $CMRO_2$, must be equal to the difference between the rate of supply and the rate of removal, assuming a steady state.\n$$CMRO_2 = (CBF \\cdot C_{aO_2}) - (CBF \\cdot C_{vO_2})$$\nFactoring out $CBF$ gives the Fick equation for oxygen metabolism:\n$$CMRO_2 = CBF \\cdot (C_{aO_2} - C_{vO_2})$$\nThe Oxygen Extraction Fraction, $OEF$, is defined as the fraction of the supplied oxygen that is extracted and consumed by the tissue. It is the ratio of the arterio-venous oxygen difference to the arterial oxygen content.\n$$OEF = \\frac{C_{aO_2} - C_{vO_2}}{C_{aO_2}}$$\nTo express $OEF$ in terms of the given parameters, we first rearrange the Fick equation to solve for the arterio-venous oxygen difference, $(C_{aO_2} - C_{vO_2})$:\n$$C_{aO_2} - C_{vO_2} = \\frac{CMRO_2}{CBF}$$\nSubstituting this expression into the definition of $OEF$:\n$$OEF = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{CMRO_2}{CBF}\\right)}{C_{aO_2}}$$\nThis simplifies to the desired expression:\n$$OEF = \\frac{CMRO_2}{CBF \\cdot C_{aO_2}}$$\nThe second task is to compute the new $OEF$ after the stimulus.

The venous oxygen saturation, $Y_v$, is defined as the fraction of hemoglobin molecules that are bound to oxygen. Deoxyhemoglobin ($dHb$) is hemoglobin that is not bound to oxygen.

The BOLD effect in gradient-echo MRI is sensitive to the concentration of deoxyhemoglobin, $[dHb]$. Deoxyhemoglobin is a paramagnetic substance, which creates microscopic magnetic field inhomogeneities in and around blood vessels. These inhomogeneities cause faster dephasing of the transverse magnetization of water protons, leading to a shorter apparent transverse relaxation time, $T_2^*$, or equivalently, a larger transverse relaxation rate, $R_2^* = 1/T_2^*$. The signal intensity, $S$, in a $T_2^*$-weighted gradient-echo sequence is approximately proportional to $\\exp(-TE \\cdot R_2^*)$, where $TE$ is the echo time.\n\nIn this problem, we calculated that $\\Delta[dHb]$ is positive, meaning the concentration of deoxyhemoglobin increases. An increase in $[dHb]$ leads to an increase in local magnetic field inhomogeneity, which in turn causes an increase in the relaxation rate $R_2^*$. Since the signal $S$ is proportional to $\\exp(-TE \\cdot R_2^*)$, an increase in $R_2^*$ will result in a more rapid signal decay, leading to a **decrease** in the measured BOLD signal intensity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.250}\n$$", "id": "4931714"}, {"introduction": "The final step in understanding the BOLD effect is to connect the change in paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin to the actual signal measured by the MRI scanner.
