The quantity that represents the strength of this spatial encoding is a wavevector, often denoted by $q$. This wavevector is created by the application of a gradient $g$ for a duration $\\delta$, mediated by the gyromagnetic ratio $\\gamma$.

This sensitization depends on the magnitude of the spatial encoding (related to $q$) and the time allowed for diffusion to occur, which is the separation time $\\Delta$. In a diffusion experiment, a phase distribution is first created by $q$. During the time $\\Delta$, particles diffuse, leading to a random displacement $\\Delta r$.

It describes a realistic scenario in quantitative medical imaging and asks for a derivation and calculation based on established physical models.\n\nThe derivation for the fractional Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) bias, $\\epsilon_{D}$, proceeds as follows.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the true applied $b$-value, $b_{\\text{true}}$, and the nominal $b$-value, $b_{\\text{nom}}$. The problem states that for a Stejskal–Tanner (ST) Pulsed Gradient Spin-Echo (PGSE) sequence with fixed timing parameters, the $b$-value is proportional to the square of the gradient amplitude, $G$. We can write this relationship as:\n$$b = k G^{2}$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality that depends on the gyromagnetic ratio and the timing parameters of the gradient pulses.\n\nThe nominal $b$-value corresponds to the nominal gradient amplitude, $G_{\\text{nom}}$:\n$$b_{\\text{nom}} = k G_{\\text{nom}}^{2}$$\nThe true applied gradient amplitude, $G_{\\text{true}}$, is given as $2\\%$ larger than nominal:\n$$G_{\\text{true}} = (1 + \\delta) G_{\\text{nom}}$$\nwhere $\\delta = 0.02$.

The physics of diffusion dictates that the measured signal, $S(b)$, is a function of the true applied $b$-value, $b_{\\text{true}}$, and the true ADC of the tissue, $D_{\\text{true}}$. According to the monoexponential model:\n$$S(b_{\\text{true}}) = S_{0} \\exp(-b_{\\text{true}} D_{\\text{true}})$$\nwhere $S_{0}$ is the signal at $b=0$.\n\nThe estimation pipeline, however, is unaware of the gradient calibration error. It calculates an estimated ADC, $D_{\\text{est}}$, by assuming the measured signal $S(b_{\\text{true}})$ was acquired at the nominal $b$-value, $b_{\\text{nom}}$. Thus, the model used for estimation is:\n$$S(b_{\\text{true}}) = S_{0} \\exp(-b_{\\text{nom}} D_{\\text{est}})$$\n\nBy equating the two expressions for the same measured signal $S(b_{\\text{true}})$, we get:\n$$S_{0} \\exp(-b_{\\text{true}} D_{\\text{true}}) = S_{0} \\exp(-b_{\\text{nom}} D_{\\text{est}})$$\nDividing by $S_{0}$ and taking the natural logarithm of both sides yields:\n$$-b_{\\text{true}} D_{\\text{true}} = -b_{\\text{nom}} D_{\\text{est}}$$\nSolving for the estimated ADC, $D_{\\text{est}}$:\n$$D_{\\text{est}} = \\frac{b_{\\text{true}}}{b_{\\text{nom}}} D_{\\text{true}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the relationship $b_{\\text{true}} = b_{\\text{nom}} (1 + \\delta)^{2}$:\n$$D_{\\textest} = \\frac{b_{\\text{nom}} (1 + \\delta)^{2}}{b_{\\text{nom}}} D_{\\text{true}} = (1 + \\delta)^{2} D_{\\text{true}}$$\n\nThe fractional ADC bias, $\\epsilon_{D}$, is defined as $\\epsilon_{D} = \\frac{D_{\\text{est}} - D_{\\text{true}}}{D_{\\text{true}}}$.

The biased measurement would yield an estimated ADC of:\n$$D_{\\text{est}} = D_{\\text{true}}(1 + \\epsilon_{D}) = (0.98 \\times 10^{-3})(1.0404) \\approx 1.0196 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{mm}^{2}/\\text{s}$$\nThis estimated value is above the threshold, which could lead to an incorrect characterization of the tissue (e.g., as benign or less aggressive). The absolute error in this case is $\\Delta D = D_{\\text{est}} - D_{\\text{true}} \\approx 0.0396 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{mm}^{2}/\\text{s}$. This error is about $20\\%$ of the reference difference of $0.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{mm}^{2}/\\text{s}$ used to distinguish tissues.

In MRI, complex receiver noise is approximately zero-mean Gaussian per channel.
