It is defined as the difference of the MTRs at the downfield ($+\\Delta$) and upfield ($-\\Delta$) offsets:\n$$ \\mathrm{MTR}_{\\mathrm{asym}}(\\Delta) = \\mathrm{MTR}(+\\Delta) - \\mathrm{MTR}(-\\Delta) $$\nThe MTR itself is defined in terms of the Z-spectrum, $Z(\\Delta)$, as $\\mathrm{MTR}(\\Delta) = 1 - Z(\\Delta)$. Substituting this into the asymmetry definition gives an equivalent expression in terms of $Z$:\n$$ \\mathrm{MTR}_{\\mathrm{asym}}(\\Delta) = (1 - Z(+\\Delta)) - (1 - Z(-\\Delta)) = Z(-\\Delta) - Z(+\\Delta) $$\nWe are given the values at the specific offset $\\Delta = 3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$:\n- $Z(+3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = 0.88$\n- $Z(-3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = 0.93$\n\nFirst, we calculate the MTR values at these offsets:\n$$ \\mathrm{MTR}(+3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = 1 - Z(+3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = 1 - 0.88 = 0.12 $$\n$$ \\mathrm{MTR}(-3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = 1 - Z(-3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = 1 - 0.93 = 0.07 $$\nNow, we can calculate the asymmetry metric, which is the first required answer:\n$$ \\mathrm{MTR}_{\\mathrm{asym}}(3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = 0.12 - 0.07 = 0.05 $$\n\nNext, we must estimate the fraction of this asymmetry that is attributable to the upfield rNOE at $-3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. The problem states that the background signal, composed of semi-solid magnetization transfer and direct water saturation, is symmetric. We can approximate this symmetric component of the Z-spectrum, $Z_{\\mathrm{sym}}$, by averaging the measured values at the positive and negative offsets:\n$$ Z_{\\mathrm{sym}}(3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = \\frac{Z(+3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) + Z(-3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm})}{2} = \\frac{0.88 + 0.93}{2} = \\frac{1.81}{2} = 0.905 $$\nThe corresponding symmetric MTR baseline, $\\mathrm{MTR}_{\\mathrm{sym}}$, is:\n$$ \\mathrm{MTR}_{\\mathrm{sym}}(3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = 1 - Z_{\\mathrm{sym}}(3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = 1 - 0.905 = 0.095 $$\nThe total measured MTR at any offset is the sum of this symmetric baseline and an asymmetric component due to specific chemical exchange effects (like amide proton transfer) or rNOE. The asymmetric component of the MTR at the upfield offset, which is attributed to the rNOE, is the deviation of the measured MTR from the symmetric baseline:\n$$ \\mathrm{MTR}_{\\mathrm{rNOE}} = \\mathrm{MTR}(-3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) - \\mathrm{MTR}_{\\mathrm{sym}}(3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = 0.07 - 0.095 = -0.025 $$\nThe magnitude of the rNOE's contribution to the asymmetry is the absolute value of this deviation:\n$$ |\\mathrm{MTR}_{\\mathrm{rNOE}}| = |-0.025| = 0.025 $$\nThe problem asks for the fraction of the total asymmetry that this contribution represents. The total asymmetry metric was calculated as $\\mathrm{MTR}_{\\mathrm{asym}}(3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = 0.05$. The required fraction, $F_{\\mathrm{rNOE}}$, is the ratio of the magnitude of the rNOE contribution to the total asymmetry metric:\n$$ F_{\\mathrm{rNOE}} = \\frac{|\\mathrm{MTR}_{\\mathrm{rNOE}}|}{\\mathrm{MTR}_{\\mathrm{asym}}(3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm})} = \\frac{0.025}{0.05} = 0.5 $$\nThis result signifies that the downfield amide effect and the upfield rNOE effect contributed equally in magnitude to the overall observed asymmetry. The downfield effect increases the MTR by $0.025$ relative to the symmetric baseline ($0.12 = 0.095 + 0.025$), while the upfield effect decreases the MTR by $0.025$ relative to the baseline ($0.07 = 0.095 - 0.025$). Their difference creates the total asymmetry of $0.05$.\n\nThe two required values are the asymmetry metric, $0.05$, and the fractional contribution from the rNOE, $0.5$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.05 & 0.5 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4866906"}]}
