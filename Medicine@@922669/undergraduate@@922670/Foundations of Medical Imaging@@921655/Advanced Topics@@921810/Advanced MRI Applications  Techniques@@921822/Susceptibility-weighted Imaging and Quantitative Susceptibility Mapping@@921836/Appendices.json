All necessary data and constants for a unique solution are provided. We shall proceed by first demonstrating the linear relationship between phase and echo time under the given conditions, and then calculate the maximum echo time that avoids phase wrapping.\n\nThe first part of the problem requires demonstrating that the accumulated phase, $\\phi$, scales linearly with the echo time, $TE$. We begin with the Larmor relation, which states that the angular precession frequency, $\\omega$, of a nuclear spin is directly proportional to the magnetic field strength, $B$, it experiences:\n$$ \\omega = \\gamma B $$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n\nIn a magnetic resonance imaging experiment, the total magnetic field experienced by spins within a voxel can be written as the sum of the main static magnetic field, $B_0$, and a small, position-dependent, and possibly time-dependent field offset, $\\Delta B(\\vec{r}, t)$. Here, the problem specifies a localized off-resonance field offset, $\\Delta B$, that is spatially uniform within the voxel and constant in time. Thus, the total field is $B = B_0 + \\Delta B$. The corresponding angular frequency is:\n$$ \\omega = \\gamma (B_0 + \\Delta B) = \\gamma B_0 + \\gamma \\Delta B $$\nThis can be expressed as the sum of the Larmor frequency, $\\omega_0 = \\gamma B_0$, and an angular frequency offset, $\\Delta\\omega = \\gamma \\Delta B$.\n\nThe phase of the transverse magnetization is defined as the time integral of the angular frequency. In the rotating frame of reference, which rotates at the Larmor frequency $\\omega_0$, the phase evolution is governed solely by the frequency offset, $\\Delta\\omega$. The problem states that the measured phase, $\\phi$, arises exclusively from this off-resonance component. Therefore, the phase accumulated from time $t=0$ until the echo time, $t=TE$, is given by the integral:\n$$ \\phi(TE) = \\int_{0}^{TE} \\Delta\\omega(t) \\,dt $$\nAccording to the problem statement, the field offset $\\Delta B$ is constant in time. Since $\\gamma$ is a fundamental constant, the frequency offset $\\Delta\\omega = \\gamma \\Delta B$ is also constant with respect to time. This allows us to take $\\Delta\\omega$ outside the integral:\n$$ \\phi(TE) = \\Delta\\omega \\int_{0}^{TE} dt = (\\gamma \\Delta B) [t]_{0}^{TE} $$\nEvaluating the definite integral yields:\n$$ \\phi(TE) = (\\gamma \\Delta B) \\cdot TE $$\nThis equation explicitly demonstrates that the acquired phase $\\phi$ is a linear function of the echo time $TE$, with the constant of proportionality being the product $\\gamma \\Delta B$.

This process constitutes a numerical consistency check, a fundamental validation step for any computational imaging algorithm. The solution rests on three core principles: the forward model of phase generation, the regularized inverse model for susceptibility reconstruction, and a quantitative error metric.\n\n**Principle 1: The Forward Model from Susceptibility to Phase**\n\nThe forward model simulates the magnetic resonance signal's phase evolution based on a given underlying tissue magnetic susceptibility distribution $\\chi(\\mathbf{r})$. This process involves two physical steps.\n\nFirst, the susceptibility distribution $\\chi(\\mathbf{r})$, which is a dimensionless measure of a material's ability to be magnetized, perturbs the main static magnetic field $B_0$. For a main field oriented along the $z$-axis, $B_0 \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, the induced field perturbation $\\Delta B(\\mathbf{r})$ is related to $\\chi(\\mathbf{r})$ through a spatial convolution with a dipole kernel. This relationship is most conveniently expressed in the Fourier domain:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}\\{\\Delta B(\\mathbf{r})\\}(\\mathbf{k}) = B_0\\, D(\\mathbf{k})\\, \\mathcal{F}\\{\\chi(\\mathbf{r})\\}(\\mathbf{k})\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{F}\\{\\cdot\\}$ denotes the three-dimensional Fourier Transform, and $\\mathbf{k} = (k_x, k_y, k_z)$ is the spatial frequency vector. The term $D(\\mathbf{k})$ is the unitless dipole kernel in the Fourier domain, given by:\n$$\nD(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{k_z^2}{k_x^2 + k_y^2 + k_z^2}\n$$\nThis kernel is undefined at the origin $\\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{0}$, where it is set to $D(\\mathbf{0}) = 0$ by convention, reflecting that the mean susceptibility value does not create a field perturbation inside the object on average. Algorithmically, this forward step is implemented by taking the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the discrete susceptibility map $\\chi(\\mathbf{r})$, multiplying it point-wise by the pre-computed discrete dipole kernel $D(\\mathbf{k})$ and the main field strength $B_0$, and then applying an inverse FFT to obtain the field perturbation $\\Delta B(\\mathbf{r})$.\n\nSecond, this static field perturbation $\\Delta B(\\mathbf{r})$ causes magnetic resonance spins to precess at a locally shifted Larmor frequency. Over the course of an echo time $\\mathrm{TE}$, this frequency shift accumulates into a measurable phase shift $\\phi(\\mathbf{r})$ in the MR signal. The relationship is linear:\n$$\n\\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\gamma\\, \\Delta B(\\mathbf{r})\\, \\mathrm{TE}\n$$\nHere, $\\gamma$ is the proton gyromagnetic ratio. This step is a simple point-wise multiplication in the spatial domain to convert the field map to a phase map.\n\n**Principle 2: The Regularized Inverse Model from Phase to Susceptibility**\n\nThe inverse problem, or QSM reconstruction, aims to estimate the underlying susceptibility distribution $\\chi(\\mathbf{r})$ from the measured phase map $\\phi(\\mathbf{r})$.\n\nThe first step is to invert the phase-field relationship to recover the field perturbation:\n$$\n\\Delta B(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{\\phi(\\mathbf{r})}{\\gamma \\mathrm{TE}}\n$$\nThe second, more challenging step is to invert the field-susceptibility relationship. A naive inversion would involve dividing by the dipole kernel in the Fourier domain. However, this is an ill-posed problem because the kernel $D(\\mathbf{k})$ has zeros for all $\\mathbf{k}$ vectors that lie on the surface of a cone where $k_z^2 / |\\mathbf{k}|^2 = 1/3$. Attempting to divide by zero at these spatial frequencies would amplify noise and lead to an unstable solution.\n\nTo address this, the problem specifies a Tikhonov regularization scheme. This method adds a penalty term to stabilize the solution. In the diagonalized Fourier basis, the regularized estimate of the susceptibility, denoted $\\widehat{\\chi}(\\mathbf{k})$, is given by:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\chi}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{A(\\mathbf{k})\\, \\mathcal{F}\\{\\Delta B\\}(\\mathbf{k})}{A(\\mathbf{k})^2 + \\lambda^2}\n$$\nwhere $A(\\mathbf{k}) = B_0\\,D(\\mathbf{k})$ is the system's forward operator in the Fourier domain and $\\lambda$ is the Tikhonov regularization parameter. The parameter $\\lambda$ has units of Tesla and ensures that the denominator never becomes zero, thus yielding a stable and unique solution. The choice of $\\lambda$ balances fidelity to the data against the smoothness of the solution. A larger $\\lambda$ provides more regularization at the cost of potentially oversmoothing the result and underestimating susceptibility values. Algorithmically, one computes the FFT of the recovered field map, applies this regularized filter point-wise in the Fourier domain, and then computes the inverse FFT to obtain the estimated susceptibility map $\\widehat{\\chi}(\\mathbf{r})$. Due to numerical precision, the result of the inverse FFT may have a small imaginary component, which is discarded by taking the real part.\n\n**Principle 3: Quantitative Error Assessment**\n\nTo complete the numerical consistency check, the reconstructed susceptibility estimate $\\widehat{\\chi}(\\mathbf{r})$ must be compared to the original ground-truth distribution $\\chi_{\\text{true}}(\\mathbf{r})$. The problem specifies the use of the root-mean-square error (RMSE), a standard metric for quantifying the difference between two datasets. The susceptibility values $\\chi$ are dimensionless, but for reporting, they are conventionally expressed in parts per million (ppm). The RMSE is thus calculated and scaled accordingly:\n$$\n\\mathrm{RMSE}_{\\mathrm{ppm}} = 10^6 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\left( \\chi_{\\text{true}}(\\mathbf{r}_n) - \\widehat{\\chi}(\\mathbf{r}_n) \\right)^2 }\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the total number of voxels in the grid, and the sum is performed over all voxels. The calculation is performed using the dimensionless susceptibility values, with the final result scaled by $10^6$ to be expressed in ppm.\n\nThis entire pipeline—from creating the ground truth $\\chi_{\\text{true}}$, performing the forward simulation to get $\\phi$, executing the regularized inversion to get $\\widehat{\\chi}$, and finally computing the RMSE—will be implemented for each of the three specified test cases (sphere, cylinder, and zero-field) to validate the numerical integrity of the QSM method.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a full numerical consistency check for Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM).\n    This involves:\n    1.
