It is scientifically grounded in the principles of magnetic resonance imaging and arterial spin labeling, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objective in its language. The problem requires a dimensional analysis proof and a unit conversion, both of which are standard procedures in physics and engineering.\n\nThe solution is presented in two parts as requested.\n\n### Part 1: Dimensional Analysis of the Perfusion Equation\n\nThe objective is to demonstrate that the proposed quantification expression for perfusion, $f$, results in the correct physical units of volume per mass per time, specifically $\\text{ml}/\\text{g}/\\text{s}$.\n\nThe problem states that perfusion $f$ is given by an expression of the form:\n$$\nf \\propto \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{T_{1,b}}\\right) \\times (\\text{dimensionless timing factor}) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\Delta S}{S_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere the proportionality constant is dimensionless. We will analyze the units of each component in this expression. Let $[X]$ denote the physical units of a quantity $X$.\n\n1.  **Blood-Brain Partition Coefficient, $\\lambda$**: This is given with units of volume per mass.\n    $$\n    [\\lambda] = \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{g}}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Longitudinal Relaxation Time of Blood, $T_{1,b}$**: This is a time constant given in seconds.\n    $$\n    [T_{1,b}] = \\text{s}\n    $$\n    Therefore, the term inversely proportional to this time constant has units of inverse time:\n    $$\n    \\left[\\frac{1}{T_{1,b}}\\right] = \\frac{1}{\\text{s}}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Dimensionless Timing Factor**: The problem explicitly states that the factor constructed from the labeling efficiency $\\alpha$, post-label delay $t_{p}$, labeling duration $\\tau$, and relaxation time $T_{1,b}$ is dimensionless.\n    $$\n    [\\text{timing factor}] = 1\n    $$\n\n4.  **Signal Ratio, $\\Delta S / S_{0}$**: This is the most critical term. The signals $\\Delta S$ and $S_{0}$ are measured in arbitrary scanner units, which we denote as a.u.\n    $$\n    [\\Delta S] = \\text{a.u.}\n    $$\n    $$\n    [S_{0}] = \\text{a.u.}\n    $$\n    A naive evaluation suggests that the ratio is dimensionless because the units cancel: $[\\Delta S / S_{0}] = \\text{a.u.}/\\text{a.u.} = 1$. However, for this to be physically meaningful, the arbitrary units must represent the same physical quantity scaled by the same constant. The problem statement provides the necessary physical basis for this.\n\n    The scanner signal, $S$, is proportional to the underlying longitudinal magnetization, $M$, via a calibration constant $c$:\n    $$\n    S = c M\n    $$\n    The units of the constant $c$ are $[\\text{a.u.}]/[\\text{magnetization}]$. The problem states that $c$ is fixed across the paired label and control measurements, as well as for the reference scan.\n\n    The difference signal $\\Delta S$ arises from the difference in magnetization between a control scan ($M_{\\text{control}}$) and a label scan ($M_{\\text{label}}$).\n    $$\n    \\Delta S = S_{\\text{control}} - S_{\\text{label}} = c M_{\\text{control}} - c M_{\\text{label}} = c(M_{\\text{control}} - M_{\\text{label}}) = c \\Delta M\n    $$\n    The reference signal $S_{0}$ is a measure of the equilibrium magnetization of tissue water, $M_{0}$.\n    $$\n    S_{0} = c M_{0}\n    $$\n    The ratio is therefore:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\Delta S}{S_{0}} = \\frac{c \\Delta M}{c M_{0}} = \\frac{\\Delta M}{M_{0}}\n    $$\n    Since $\\Delta M$ and $M_{0}$ both represent magnetization, their ratio is a pure, dimensionless number. The instrument-specific calibration constant $c$ and its associated arbitrary units rigorously cancel out. Thus, the signal ratio is truly dimensionless.\n    $$\n    \\left[\\frac{\\Delta S}{S_{0}}\\right] = \\frac{[\\text{magnetization}]}{[\\text{magnetization}]} = 1\n    $$\n\n5.  **Assembling the Units for Perfusion, $f$**: We can now combine the units of all components in the expression for $f$.\n    $$\n    [f] = \\left[\\frac{\\lambda}{T_{1,b}}\\right] \\times [\\text{timing factor}] \\times \\left[\\frac{\\Delta S}{S_{0}}\\right]\n    $$\n    $$\n    [f] = \\frac{[\\lambda]}{[T_{1,b}]} \\times 1 \\times 1 = \\frac{\\text{ml}/\\text{g}}{\\text{s}} = \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{g} \\cdot \\text{s}}\n    $$\n    This result, $\\text{ml}/\\text{g}/\\text{s}$, represents a volume ($\\text{ml}$) of blood delivered per unit mass ($\\text{g}$) of tissue per unit time ($\\text{s}$), which is the definition of perfusion. The dimensional analysis is therefore successful.\n\n### Part 2: Unit Conversion Factor\n\nThe second task is to determine the numerical multiplier that converts a value of perfusion $f$ from units of $\\text{ml}/\\text{g}/\\text{s}$ to the clinically conventional units of $\\text{ml}/100\\text{g}/\\text{min}$.\n\nLet $f_{\\text{si}}$ be the numerical value of perfusion in units of $\\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{g} \\cdot \\text{s}}$, and let $f_{\\text{clin}}$ be the numerical value in units of $\\frac{\\text{ml}}{100\\text{g} \\cdot \\text{min}}$. The physical quantity must be the same, so we can write the equality:\n$$\nf_{\\text{si}} \\left[ \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{g} \\cdot \\text{s}} \\right] = f_{\\text{clin}} \\left[ \\frac{\\text{ml}}{100\\text{g} \\cdot \\text{min}} \\right]\n$$\nWe want to find the conversion factor $k$ such that $f_{\\text{clin}} = k \\cdot f_{\\text{si}}$. Rearranging the equation above to solve for $k$ gives:\n$$\nk = \\frac{f_{\\text{clin}}}{f_{\\text{si}}} = \\frac{\\left[ \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{g} \\cdot \\text{s}} \\right]}{\\left[ \\frac{\\text{ml}}{100\\text{g} \\cdot \\text{min}} \\right]}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this ratio of units:\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{g} \\cdot \\text{s}} \\times \\frac{100\\text{g} \\cdot \\text{min}}{\\text{ml}}\n$$\nThe unit $\\text{ml}$ cancels from the numerator and denominator. The unit $\\text{g}$ also cancels.\n$$\nk = \\frac{100 \\cdot \\text{min}}{\\text{s}}\n$$\nTo find the numerical value of $k$, we use the conversion between minutes and seconds: $1 \\text{ min} = 60 \\text{ s}$.\n$$\nk = 100 \\times \\frac{60 \\text{ s}}{\\text{s}}\n$$\nThe unit $\\text{s}$ cancels, leaving a dimensionless numerical factor.\n$$\nk = 100 \\times 60 = 6000\n$$\nTherefore, to convert a perfusion value from $\\text{ml}/\\text{g}/\\text{s}$ to $\\text{ml}/100\\text{g}/\\text{min}$, one must multiply by $6000$.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the ASL Signal Equation\n\nThe problem can be solved by modeling the kinetics of the difference magnetization, $\\Delta M$, in the tissue voxel. We adopt a standard timeline for pseudo-continuous or continuous ASL (pCASL/CASL): labeling occurs from time $t' = -\\tau$ to $t' = 0$, followed by a post-labeling delay $w$. Image acquisition occurs at time $t = w$.\n\nThe change in tissue difference magnetization, $\\Delta M(t)$, per unit mass of tissue, is governed by the general kinetic model:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\Delta M(t))}{dt} = \\text{Inflow}(t) - \\text{Decay}(t) $$\nThe inflow term is the rate of delivery of labeled magnetization from arterial blood, and the decay term represents the longitudinal relaxation of the labeled spins in the tissue.\n\nThe difference magnetization of arterial blood at the labeling site is $2\\alpha M_{0b}$, where $M_{0b}$ is the equilibrium magnetization of blood per unit volume. This labeled blood takes a time $\\delta$ to travel to the tissue voxel. During this transit, the magnetization decays by a factor of $\\exp(-\\delta/T_{1b})$. Thus, the arterial difference magnetization arriving at the voxel, $M_a(t)$, is:\n$$ M_a(t) = 2\\alpha M_{0b} \\exp(-\\delta/T_{1b}) $$\nThis constant influx occurs for the duration that the labeled bolus passes through the voxel. A packet labeled at time $t' \\in [-\\tau, 0]$ arrives at time $t = t' + \\delta$. Therefore, the arrival window is from $t = -\\tau+\\delta$ to $t = \\delta$.\n\nThe inflow of magnetization into the tissue, per gram of tissue, is given by the product of blood flow $f$ and the arterial magnetization $M_a(t)$. The problem states this concentration is divided by the partition coefficient $\\lambda$ to express magnetization per gram of tissue. However, a more rigorous derivation normalizes the signals. Let us model the normalized difference signal, $\\Delta m(t) = \\Delta M(t) / M_0$. The kinetic equation for $\\Delta m(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\Delta m(t))}{dt} = \\frac{f M_a(t)}{\\lambda M_{0b}} - \\frac{\\Delta m(t)}{T_{1b}} $$\nHere, we use the tissue T1 as $T_{1b}$ as specified. The relation $M_0 = \\lambda M_{0b}$ connects the equilibrium magnetization per gram of tissue ($M_0$) to that per ml of blood ($M_{0b}$). Substituting for $M_a(t)$ and $M_{0b}$:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\Delta m(t))}{dt} + \\frac{\\Delta m(t)}{T_{1b}} = \\frac{f}{\\lambda M_{0b}} \\left( 2\\alpha M_{0b} \\exp(-\\delta/T_{1b}) \\right) = \\frac{2\\alpha f}{\\lambda} \\exp(-\\delta/T_{1b}) $$\nThis equation holds during the arrival period, $t \\in [\\delta-\\tau, \\delta]$. Let the constant driving term be $K = \\frac{2\\alpha f}{\\lambda} \\exp(-\\delta/T_{1b})$.\n\nWe solve for $\\Delta m(t)$ at the readout time $t=w$. The solution depends on the timing of $w$ relative to the arrival window $[\\delta-\\tau, \\delta]$. We need to consider three regimes:\n\n1.  **$w < \\delta - \\tau$**: Readout occurs before any label arrives. $\\Delta m(w) = 0$.\n2.  **$\\delta - \\tau \\le w \\le \\delta$**: Readout occurs while the label is being delivered. The solution to the differential equation, with initial condition $\\Delta m(\\delta-\\tau) = 0$, is:\n    $$ \\Delta m(t) = K T_{1b} (1 - \\exp(-(t - (\\delta-\\tau))/T_{1b})) $$\n    At $t=w$:\n    $$ \\Delta m(w) = \\frac{2\\alpha f T_{1b}}{\\lambda} \\exp(-\\delta/T_{1b}) (1 - \\exp(-(w - \\delta + \\tau)/T_{1b})) $$\n3.  **$w > \\delta$**: Readout occurs after the entire labeled bolus has arrived. First, we find the accumulated signal at the end of the arrival period, $t=\\delta$:\n    $$ \\Delta m(\\delta) = K T_{1b} (1 - \\exp(-(\\delta - (\\delta-\\tau))/T_{1b})) = K T_{1b} (1 - \\exp(-\\tau/T_{1b})) $$\n    For $t > \\delta$, there is no further inflow of label, so the magnetization decays freely:\n    $$ \\Delta m(t) = \\Delta m(\\delta) \\exp(-(t-\\delta)/T_{1b}) $$\n    At the readout time $t=w$:\n    $$ \\Delta m(w) = \\Delta m(\\delta) \\exp(-(w-\\delta)/T_{1b}) = \\left[ K T_{1b} (1 - \\exp(-\\tau/T_{1b})) \\right] \\exp(-(w-\\delta)/T_{1b}) $$\n    Substituting the expression for $K$:\n    $$ \\Delta m(w) = \\left[ \\frac{2\\alpha f T_{1b}}{\\lambda} \\exp(-\\delta/T_{1b}) (1 - \\exp(-\\tau/T_{1b})) \\right] \\exp(-(w-\\delta)/T_{1b}) $$\n    The exponential terms containing $\\delta$ combine: $\\exp(-\\delta/T_{1b}) \\cdot \\exp(-(w-\\delta)/T_{1b}) = \\exp(-\\delta/T_{1b} - w/T_{1b} + \\delta/T_{1b}) = \\exp(-w/T_{1b})$.\n    Thus, for $w > \\delta$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta M}{M_0} = \\Delta m(w) = \\frac{2\\alpha f T_{1b}}{\\lambda} (1 - \\exp(-\\tau/T_{1b})) \\exp(-w/T_{1b}) $$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the normalized difference signal under the specified conditions.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\n\nWe first check which regime applies to the given parameters:\n- $\\tau = 1.8 \\ \\mathrm{s}$\n- $\\delta = 1.2 \\ \\mathrm{s}$\n- $w = 1.8 \\ \\mathrm{s}$\n\nThe condition for the third regime is $w > \\delta$.

Thus, the magnetization of the blood arriving at the imaging voxel is:\n$$\nM_{z, \\text{control}}(w) = M_{0b}\n$$\nThe ASL difference signal, $S$, is proportional to the difference in magnetization between the control and label acquisitions at the imaging voxel. Let this difference be $\\Delta M_z$.\n$$\n\\Delta M_z(w) = M_{z, \\text{control}}(w) - M_{z, \\text{label}}(w)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta M_z(w) = M_{0b} - \\left[M_{0b} \\left(1 - 2\\exp\\left(-\\frac{w}{T_{1b}}\\right)\\right)\\right] = 2 M_{0b} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{w}{T_{1b}}\\right)\n$$\nThe measured signal $S$ a function of $T_{1b}$ is proportional to this magnetization difference. This proportionality incorporates system-dependent gains, imaging sequence parameters, and physiological factors like blood flow and the labeling efficiency $\\alpha$. We can group all these factors into a single constant $C$, as they are stated to be independent of $T_{1b}$.\n$$\nS(T_{1b}) = C \\cdot \\alpha \\cdot \\Delta M_z(w) = (2 C \\alpha M_{0b}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{w}{T_{1b}}\\right)\n$$\nLet $K = 2 C \\alpha M_{0b}$. Since all factors within $K$ ($C$, $\\alpha$, $M_{0b}$) are held fixed as per the problem statement, $K$ is a constant. The functional dependence of the ASL signal on $T_{1b}$ is therefore:\n$$\nS(T_{1b}) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{w}{T_{1b}}\\right)\n$$\nThis justifies the functional dependence requested, showing that the signal decays exponentially as a function of the ratio of the post-labeling delay to the longitudinal relaxation time.\n\nNow, we compute the fractional change in the ASL signal when the magnetic field strength changes from $1.5$ T to $3$ T. Let $S_{1.5\\ \\mathrm{T}}$ be the signal at $1.5$ T and $S_{3\\ \\mathrm{T}}$ be the signal at $3$ T. The corresponding blood $T_{1b}$ values are $T_{1b, 1.5\\mathrm{T}} = 1.5$ s and $T_{1b, 3\\mathrm{T}} = 1.8$ s. The post-labeling delay is fixed at $w=1.5$ s.\n\nThe signals at the two field strengths are:\n$$\nS_{1.5\\ \\mathrm{T}} = K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{w}{T_{1b, 1.5\\mathrm{T}}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nS_{3\\ \\mathrm{T}} = K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{w}{T_{1b, 3\\mathrm{T}}}\\right)\n$$\nThe fractional change is defined as:\n$$\n\\frac{S_{3\\ \\mathrm{T}} - S_{1.5\\ \\mathrm{T}}}{S_{1.5\\ \\mathrm{T}}} = \\frac{S_{3\\ \\mathrm{T}}}{S_{1.5\\ \\mathrm{T}}} - 1\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the signals:\n$$\n\\frac{K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{w}{T_{1b, 3\\mathrm{T}}}\\right)}{K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{w}{T_{1b, 1.5\\mathrm{T}}}\\right)} - 1 = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{w}{T_{1b, 3\\mathrm{T}}} + \\frac{w}{T_{1b, 1.5\\mathrm{T}}}\\right) - 1\n$$\n$$\n= \\exp\\left(w \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{1b, 1.5\\mathrm{T}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{1b, 3\\mathrm{T}}}\\right)\\right) - 1\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $w=1.5$ s, $T_{1b, 1.5\\mathrm{T}}=1.5$ s, and $T_{1b, 3\\mathrm{T}}=1.8$ s.\n$$\n\\text{Fractional Change} = \\exp\\left(1.5 \\left(\\frac{1}{1.5} - \\frac{1}{1.8}\\right)\\right) - 1\n$$\nThe exponent can be simplified:\n$$\n1.5 \\left(\\frac{1}{1.5} - \\frac{1}{1.8}\\right) = 1.5 \\times \\frac{1}{1.5} - 1.5 \\times \\frac{1}{1.8} = 1 - \\frac{1.5}{1.8} = 1 - \\frac{15}{18} = 1 - \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}\n$$\nSo, the fractional change is:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) - 1\n$$\nWe now compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) - 1 \\approx 1.18136034 - 1 = 0.18136034\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures, we get $0.1814$. The increase in blood $T_{1b}$ at the higher field strength leads to less signal decay during the post-labeling delay, resulting in a larger ASL difference signal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1814}$$", "id": "4905352"}]}
