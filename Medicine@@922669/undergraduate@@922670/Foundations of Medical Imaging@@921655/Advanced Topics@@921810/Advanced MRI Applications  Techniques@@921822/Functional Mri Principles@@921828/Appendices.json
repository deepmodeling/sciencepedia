The sequence uses an in-plane parallel imaging factor $R = 2$ and partial Fourier sampling in the phase-encode direction with a fraction $p = 6/8$.

The full k-space requires $N_y$ lines.\nPartial Fourier imaging reduces the number of lines that need to be acquired. With a partial Fourier fraction of $p$, the number of required lines is reduced to $p \\times N_y$. For this problem, $p = 6/8 = 0.75$.\n\nParallel imaging further reduces the number of acquired lines by undersampling k-space and using coil sensitivity information to reconstruct the full image. An acceleration factor of $R$ means that only $1/R$ of the phase-encoding lines are sampled.\n\nWhen both techniques are combined, the total number of acquired phase-encoding lines is given by the product of these reduction factors applied to the full number of lines:\n$$N_{acq} = \\frac{p \\times N_y}{R}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$N_y = 96$\n$p = 6/8 = 0.75$\n$R = 2$\n$$N_{acq} = \\frac{0.75 \\times 96}{2} = \\frac{72}{2} = 36$$\nSo, $36$ distinct echoes, each corresponding to a unique $k_y$ line, are acquired.\n\nThe echo train duration, $T_{ETL}$, is the time elapsed from the center of the first acquired echo to the center of the last acquired echo. Since there are $N_{acq}$ echoes separated by the echo spacing $t_{\\mathrm{esp}}$, there are $(N_{acq} - 1)$ such intervals.\nThe general expression for the echo train duration is:\n$$T_{ETL} = (N_{acq} - 1) \\times t_{\\mathrm{esp}}$$\nSubstituting the formula for $N_{acq}$, we have:\n$$T_{ETL} = \\left(\\frac{p N_y}{R} - 1\\right) t_{\\mathrm{esp}}$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically with the given parameters:\n$$T_{ETL} = (36 - 1) \\times 0.65\\ \\mathrm{ms} = 35 \\times 0.65\\ \\mathrm{ms} = 22.75\\ \\mathrm{ms}$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, the echo train duration is $22.8\\ \\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nNext, we qualitatively explain the influence of the total echo train duration, $T_{ETL}$, on image artifacts.\n\n1.  **$T_2^*$-related Blurring:**\n    The signal intensity in a gradient-echo sequence decays over time due to transverse relaxation, described by the effective relaxation time $T_2^*$. The signal magnitude at a time $t$ after the excitation is proportional to $\\exp(-t/T_2^*)$. In EPI, different $k_y$ lines are acquired at different times spanning the echo train duration $T_{ETL}$. Typically, the central lines of k-space (low spatial frequencies, which determine image contrast and overall structure) are acquired near the central echo time ($TE$), while peripheral k-space lines (high spatial frequencies, which determine edges and details) are acquired earlier or later in the echo train.\n    A long $T_{ETL}$ means that the signals for echoes acquired late in the train are significantly more attenuated than those acquired early on. This differential signal decay across k-space acts as a filter. Since high spatial frequencies are attenuated more than low spatial frequencies, this is equivalent to multiplying k-space by a low-pass filter function. In the image domain, this convolution with the point spread function (PSF) corresponding to the filter (a Lorentzian-like profile) manifests as blurring along the phase-encode direction. Therefore, a longer $T_{ETL}$ results in more pronounced $T_2^*$ blurring.\n\n2.  **Geometric Distortions:**\n    Geometric distortions along the phase-encode direction are caused by static magnetic field inhomogeneities or susceptibility variations, which create a local off-resonance frequency $\\Delta f$. This off-resonance causes an additional phase accumulation in the signal, $\\phi(t) = 2\\pi \\Delta f\\, t$.\n    In EPI, each $k_y$ line is acquired at a different point in time. The $n$-th phase-encoding line is acquired at a time $t_n$ within the echo train. This results in a phase error $\\phi_n = 2\\pi \\Delta f\\, t_n$ that varies linearly with the position in the k-space ($k_y$) acquisition order. According to the Fourier shift theorem, a linear phase ramp in k-space corresponds to a spatial shift in the image domain. The magnitude of this shift, $\\Delta y$, is proportional to the rate of phase change across k-space.\n    A longer $T_{ETL}$ means that the maximum time difference between acquired echoes is larger. This allows a greater total phase error ($2\\pi \\Delta f\\, T_{ETL}$) to accumulate across the sampled portion of k-space for any given $\\Delta f$. This larger accumulated phase error results in a greater spatial shift, or distortion, in the reconstructed image along the phase-encode direction. Common manifestations include signal pile-up, signal dropout, and spatial warping, particularly near air-tissue interfaces like the sinuses.
