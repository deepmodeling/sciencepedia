All provided parameters are consistent and realistic for an Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) experiment. The problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for three parts: first, a derivation from first principles of the geometric displacement in the phase-encode direction due to off-resonance effects in EPI; second, an evaluation of this displacement in units of pixels for the given parameters; and third, two proposals for sequence parameter changes to reduce this distortion while maintaining the single-scan Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Geometric Displacement**\n\nIn magnetic resonance imaging, the spatial location of spins is encoded into the phase and frequency of the detected signal. The signal received from a voxel at position $\\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)$ is demodulated to remove the Larmor frequency, leaving a signal component proportional to $\\exp(-i\\phi(t))$. The phase $\\phi(t)$ accumulates over time due to the applied magnetic field gradients and any local field inhomogeneities.\n\nThe intended phase for a spin at position $y$ due to the phase-encoding gradient is given by:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\text{intended}}(t) = 2\\pi k_y(t) y\n$$\nwhere $k_y(t)$ is the spatial frequency in the phase-encode direction ($y$) at time $t$, defined as $k_y(t) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} \\int_0^t G_y(\\tau) d\\tau$. $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio and $G_y$ is the phase-encoding gradient amplitude.\n\nA static off-resonance field inhomogeneity introduces a local frequency offset $\\Delta f$. This offset causes an additional, unintended phase accumulation over time:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\text{error}}(t) = 2\\pi \\Delta f t\n$$\nThe total phase accumulated for the spin at position $y$ and time $t$ is the sum of the intended and error phases:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\text{total}}(t) = \\phi_{\\text{intended}}(t) + \\phi_{\\text{error}}(t) = 2\\pi k_y(t) y + 2\\pi \\Delta f t\n$$\nThe image reconstruction process, typically a Fourier Transform, assumes that all accumulated phase is due to spatial encoding. It therefore assigns the signal to an apparent position $y'$ such that:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\text{total}}(t) = 2\\pi k_y(t) y'\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for the total phase, we get:\n$$\n2\\pi k_y(t) y' = 2\\pi k_y(t) y + 2\\pi \\Delta f t\n$$\nDividing by $2\\pi$ yields:\n$$\nk_y(t) y' = k_y(t) y + \\Delta f t\n$$\nIn a single-shot EPI sequence, each phase-encode line in k-space is acquired at a discrete time point. The $n$-th phase-encode line, corresponding to $k_{y,n} = n \\cdot \\Delta k_y$, is acquired at time $t_n = n \\cdot \\text{ESP}$, where $\\Delta k_y$ is the k-space step size, $\\text{ESP}$ is the echo spacing, and $n$ is the phase-encode line index (relative to the k-space center).\n\nSubstituting these discrete relationships into the equation (for $n \\neq 0$):\n$$\n(n \\cdot \\Delta k_y) y' = (n \\cdot \\Delta k_y) y + \\Delta f (n \\cdot \\text{ESP})\n$$\nDividing by $n \\cdot \\Delta k_y$ gives the relationship between the apparent position $y'$ and the true position $y$:\n$$\ny' = y + \\frac{\\Delta f \\cdot \\text{ESP}}{\\Delta k_y}\n$$\nThe geometric displacement, $\\Delta y$, is the difference between the apparent and true positions:\n$$\n\\Delta y = y' - y = \\frac{\\Delta f \\cdot \\text{ESP}}{\\Delta k_y}\n$$\nThis is the fundamental relationship for the geometric displacement in physical units (meters).\n\n**Part 2: Evaluation of Displacement in Pixels**\n\nFirst, we calculate the displacement $\\Delta y$ in meters using the provided values:\n$\\Delta f = 80 \\text{ Hz}$\n$\\text{ESP} = 0.60 \\text{ ms} = 0.60 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ s}$\n$\\Delta k_y = 3.90625 \\text{ m}^{-1}$\n\n$$\n\\Delta y = \\frac{(80 \\text{ s}^{-1}) \\cdot (0.60 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ s})}{3.90625 \\text{ m}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.048}{3.90625} \\text{ m} = 0.012288 \\text{ m}\n$$\nNext, we convert this physical displacement into pixels. The size of a single pixel in the phase-encode direction, $\\delta y$, is the field of view ($\\text{FoV}_y$) divided by the number of phase-encode lines ($N_{\\text{pe}}$). The $\\text{FoV}_y$ is determined by the k-space step size: $\\text{FoV}_y = 1/\\Delta k_y$.\n\n$$\n\\delta y = \\frac{\\text{FoV}_y}{N_{\\text{pe}}} = \\frac{1/\\Delta k_y}{N_{\\text{pe}}} = \\frac{1}{N_{\\text{pe}} \\Delta k_y}\n$$\nUsing the given values $N_{\\text{pe}} = 128$ and $\\Delta k_y = 3.90625 \\text{ m}^{-1}$:\n$$\n\\delta y = \\frac{1}{128 \\cdot 3.90625 \\text{ m}^{-1}} = \\frac{1}{500} \\text{ m} = 0.002 \\text{ m}\n$$\nThe displacement in pixels, $\\Delta y_{\\text{pixels}}$, is the physical displacement $\\Delta y$ divided by the pixel size $\\delta y$:\n$$\n\\Delta y_{\\text{pixels}} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\delta y} = \\frac{0.012288 \\text{ m}}{0.002 \\text{ m/pixel}} = 6.144 \\text{ pixels}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the displacement is $6.14$ pixels. An alternative and equivalent calculation is $\\Delta y_{\\text{pixels}} = \\Delta f \\cdot N_{\\text{pe}} \\cdot \\text{ESP} = 80 \\cdot 128 \\cdot (0.60 \\times 10^{-3}) = 6.144$.\n\n**Part 3: Proposals for Reducing Geometric Distortion**\n\nThe magnitude of the distortion in pixels is given by $\\Delta y_{\\text{pixels}} = \\Delta f \\cdot N_{\\text{pe}} \\cdot \\text{ESP}$. To reduce this distortion, one must decrease the product $N_{\\text{pe}} \\cdot \\text{ESP}$, which is the total duration of the EPI echo train. However, this must be done while maintaining a constant single-scan SNR. Here are two distinct proposals:\n\n1.  **Decrease the phase-encode matrix size ($N_{\\text{pe}}$) while keeping the field of view ($\\text{FoV}_y$) constant.**\n    *   **Justification:** The distortion in pixels, $\\Delta y_{\\text{pixels}} = \\Delta f \\cdot N_{\\text{pe}} \\cdot \\text{ESP}$, is directly proportional to $N_{\\text{pe}}$. Decreasing $N_{\\text{pe}}$ will thus reduce the distortion. For a constant $\\text{FoV}_y$, decreasing $N_{\\text{pe}}$ results in a larger pixel size, $\\delta_y = \\text{FoV}_y / N_{\\text{pe}}$. The SNR per voxel is proportional to the voxel volume ($\\text{SNR} \\propto \\delta_x \\delta_y \\delta_z$). While decreasing $N_{pe}$ also reduces the total acquisition time, which tends to reduce SNR ($\\text{SNR} \\propto \\sqrt{T_{acq}}$), the increase in voxel volume is a more dominant factor for SNR per voxel in this context. Specifically, $\\text{SNR} \\propto \\delta_y \\sqrt{N_{pe}} \\propto (\\text{FoV}_y/N_{pe}) \\sqrt{N_{pe}} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{N_{pe}}$. This simplified model shows that decreasing $N_{pe}$ actually increases SNR. Therefore, this strategy reduces distortion while not just maintaining, but improving SNR. The trade-off is a loss of spatial resolution in the phase-encode direction.\n\n2.  **Employ a parallel imaging technique (e.g., SENSE, GRAPPA) and increase the slice thickness ($\\delta_z$).**\n    *   **Justification:** Parallel imaging with an acceleration factor $R > 1$ works by skipping phase-encoding lines, acquiring only $N_{\\text{pe}}/R$ lines. This shortens the echo train duration to $(N_{\\text{pe}}/R) \\cdot \\text{ESP}$, which reduces the geometric distortion by a factor of $R$. However, parallel imaging incurs an SNR penalty, given by $SNR_{new} = SNR_{old} / (g \\sqrt{R})$, where $g \\ge 1$ is the geometry factor. To satisfy the constraint of maintaining SNR, a compensatory parameter change is required. Since $\\text{SNR} \\propto \\delta_z$ (voxel volume), we can increase the slice thickness $\\delta_z$ to offset the SNR loss. This is a common strategy in clinical practice to accelerate scans and reduce artifacts while preserving acceptable image quality. The trade-off is reduced spatial resolution in the slice direction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.14}$$", "id": "4881057"}, {"introduction": "Following the theme of phase errors, we now examine another quintessential EPI artifact: the N/2 ghost.
