The derivation begins with the fundamental principles of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).\n\nThe Larmor frequency, $\\nu_0$, is the precessional frequency of a nuclear spin in a static magnetic field $B_0$. It is given by the Larmor equation:\n$$ \\nu_0 = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_0 $$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio, a constant specific to the nucleus. For the proton ($^1\\mathrm{H}$), the value $\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi}$ is given as $42.577 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Hz/T}$.\n\nIn a molecule, the electrons surrounding a nucleus generate a small, local magnetic field that opposes the main field $B_0$. This effect is called shielding. The effective magnetic field experienced by the nucleus is $B_{eff} = B_0(1-\\sigma)$, where $\\sigma$ is the shielding constant. Consequently, the resonance frequency of a shielded nucleus is slightly shifted:\n$$ \\nu = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_{eff} = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_0(1-\\sigma) = \\nu_0 (1-\\sigma) $$\n\nThe absolute frequency $\\nu$ depends on the magnetic field strength $B_0$. To have a field-independent measure, the chemical shift, $\\delta$, is defined. The chemical shift of a nucleus is the difference between its resonance frequency, $\\nu_{sample}$, and the resonance frequency of a reference compound, $\\nu_{ref}$, normalized by the spectrometer's operating frequency (which is effectively $\\nu_{ref}$ or very close to $\\nu_0$), and expressed in parts per million ($ppm$):\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{\\nu_{sample} - \\nu_{ref}}{\\nu_{ref}} \\times 10^6 $$\n\nNow, consider two distinct groups of protons in a sample, giving rise to two spectral peaks at frequencies $\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_2$. Their respective chemical shifts relative to a common reference frequency $\\nu_{ref}$ are:\n$$ \\delta_1 = \\frac{\\nu_1 - \\nu_{ref}}{\\nu_{ref}} \\times 10^6 $$\n$$ \\delta_2 = \\frac{\\nu_2 - \\nu_{ref}}{\\nu_{ref}} \\times 10^6 $$\n\nThe difference in chemical shift between these two peaks, $\\Delta\\delta$, is:\n$$ \\Delta\\delta = \\delta_1 - \\delta_2 = \\left( \\frac{\\nu_1 - \\nu_{ref}}{\\nu_{ref}} - \\frac{\\nu_2 - \\nu_{ref}}{\\nu_{ref}} \\right) \\times 10^6 = \\frac{\\nu_1 - \\nu_2}{\\nu_{ref}} \\times 10^6 $$\n\nThe absolute frequency separation between the two peaks is $\\Delta\\nu = |\\nu_1 - \\nu_2|$. The reference frequency $\\nu_{ref}$ is the Larmor frequency of the reference protons, which is extremely close to the base Larmor frequency $\\nu_0$ for the given field $B_0$. Therefore, we can approximate $\\nu_{ref} \\approx \\nu_0$. The relationship becomes:\n$$ |\\Delta\\delta| = \\frac{\\Delta\\nu}{\\nu_0} \\times 10^6 $$\nThis equation connects the chemical shift difference in $ppm$ to the absolute frequency separation $\\Delta\\nu$ in $Hz$.\n\nThe problem specifies a chemical-shift difference of $1\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, so $|\\Delta\\delta| = 1$. Substituting this into the equation and rearranging for $\\Delta\\nu$ gives the desired relationship:\n$$ 1 = \\frac{\\Delta\\nu}{\\nu_0} \\times 10^6 $$\n$$ \\Delta\\nu = \\nu_0 \\times 10^{-6} $$\nSubstituting the Larmor equation $\\nu_0 = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_0$ yields the final form of the relationship:\n$$ \\Delta\\nu = \\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_0 \\right) \\times 10^{-6} $$\nThis derived expression shows that the absolute frequency separation ($\\Delta\\nu$) corresponding to a $1\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ chemical shift difference is directly proportional to the static magnetic field strength $B_0$.\n\nNext, we compute the absolute frequency separation for a $1\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ shift at the two given magnetic field strengths, using the provided value $\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} = 42.577 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Hz/T}$.\n\nFor $B_0 = 3\\,\\mathrm{T}$:\nThe Larmor frequency is $\\nu_0 = (42.577 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz/T}) \\times (3\\,\\mathrm{T}) = 127.731 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\nThe frequency separation for a $1\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ shift is:\n$$ \\Delta\\nu_{3T} = \\nu_0 \\times 10^{-6} = (127.731 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz}) \\times 10^{-6} = 127.731\\,\\mathrm{Hz} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\Delta\\nu_{3T} = 127.7\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nFor $B_0 = 7\\,\\mathrm{T}$:\nThe Larmor frequency is $\\nu_0 = (42.577 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz/T}) \\times (7\\,\\mathrm{T}) = 298.039 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\nThe frequency separation for a $1\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ shift is:\n$$ \\Delta\\nu_{7T} = \\nu_0 \\times 10^{-6} = (298.039 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz}) \\times 10^{-6} = 298.039\\,\\mathrm{Hz} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\Delta\\nu_{7T} = 298.0\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nFinally, we explain how increasing $B_0$ affects the absolute peak separation. As derived, the absolute frequency separation $\\Delta\\nu$ for a fixed chemical shift difference $\\Delta\\delta$ is given by $\\Delta\\nu = \\nu_0 \\frac{|\\Delta\\delta|}{10^6}$. Since the Larmor frequency $\\nu_0$ is directly proportional to the static magnetic field strength $B_0$ (via $\\nu_0 = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_0$), it follows that $\\Delta\\nu$ is also directly proportional to $B_0$. Therefore, increasing the static magnetic field strength $B_0$ leads to a larger absolute frequency separation (in $Hz$) between two peaks that have a constant chemical shift difference (in $ppm$). This enhanced spectral dispersion at higher field strengths is a major advantage in MRS, as it improves the ability to resolve and identify different chemical species whose resonance peaks are close to each other. Our calculation confirms this, as the separation increased from $127.7\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ at $3\\,\\mathrm{T}$ to $298.0\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ at $7\\,\\mathrm{T}$ for the same $1\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ shift.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 127.7 & 298.0 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4898703"}, {"introduction": "Once a spectrum is acquired, its quality is often judged by the sharpness of its peaks, which is governed by the spectral resolution.
