A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe foundational principle of MRI is that the precessional frequency of a nuclear spin is proportional to the local magnetic field strength. In the presence of a linear magnetic field gradient $\\mathbf{G}(t)$, the total magnetic field experienced by a spin at position $\\mathbf{r}=(x,y,z)$ is $B(\\mathbf{r}, t) = B_0 + \\mathbf{G}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{r}$, where $B_0$ is the static main magnetic field. The spatially dependent component of the angular frequency is $\\Delta\\omega(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\gamma (\\mathbf{G}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{r})$.\n\nThe phase accumulated by this spin at time $t$ relative to the Larmor frequency $\\omega_0 = \\gamma B_0$ is the time integral of this frequency offset:\n$$ \\phi(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\int_0^t \\Delta\\omega(\\mathbf{r}, \\tau) d\\tau = \\gamma \\int_0^t \\mathbf{G}(\\tau) \\cdot \\mathbf{r} d\\tau = \\left( \\gamma \\int_0^t \\mathbf{G}(\\tau) d\\tau \\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{r} $$\nThe complex MRI signal $S(t)$ is the integral of the transverse magnetization over the entire object volume, which is proportional to the Fourier transform of the spin density distribution $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$:\n$$ S(t) \\propto \\int \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\exp(-i \\phi(\\mathbf{r}, t)) d\\mathbf{r} $$\nThe mathematical definition of the multi-dimensional Fourier transform relates a function $f(\\mathbf{r})$ to its transform $F(\\mathbf{k})$ via the expression $F(\\mathbf{k}) = \\int f(\\mathbf{r}) \\exp(-i 2\\pi \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r}$. By comparing the exponents in the signal equation and the Fourier transform definition, we can define the k-space vector $\\mathbf{k}(t)$:\n$$ 2\\pi \\mathbf{k}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{r} = \\phi(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\left( \\gamma \\int_0^t \\mathbf{G}(\\tau) d\\tau \\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{r} $$\nSince this must hold for all $\\mathbf{r}$, we obtain the definition of the k-space trajectory:\n$$ \\mathbf{k}(t) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} \\int_0^t \\mathbf{G}(\\tau) d\\tau $$\nDifferentiating with respect to time gives the velocity in k-space:\n$$ \\frac{d\\mathbf{k}(t)}{dt} = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} \\mathbf{G}(t) $$\nThis is the fundamental equation relating the applied gradient to the traversal of k-space. It is often convenient to use the gyromagnetic ratio in units of Hz/T, $\\bar{\\gamma} = \\gamma/(2\\pi)$, so the equation becomes $\\frac{d\\mathbf{k}(t)}{dt} = \\bar{\\gamma} \\mathbf{G}(t)$.\n\nFor this problem, a constant readout gradient $G_x$ is applied along the x-axis, so $\\mathbf{G}(t) = (G_x, 0)$ for the duration of the readout. The k-space trajectory is therefore a straight line along the $k_x$ axis. Integrating the equation of motion gives:\n$$ k_x(t) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x t $$\nassuming $k_x(0) = 0$.\n\nData is sampled uniformly with a dwell time $\\Delta t$. The k-space position of the $n$-th sample, taken at time $t_n = n \\Delta t$, is $k_x(t_n) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x (n \\Delta t)$. The distance between adjacent samples in k-space, the sampling increment $\\Delta k_x$, is:\n$$ \\Delta k_x = k_x(t_{n+1}) - k_x(t_n) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x \\Delta t $$\nThis is the first required expression.\n\nNow we incorporate the imaging parameters.\nFirst, the dwell time $\\Delta t$ is determined by the receiver bandwidth $BW$. The problem states $BW = 1/\\Delta t$.\n$$ \\Delta t = \\frac{1}{BW} = \\frac{1}{2.00 \\times 10^5~\\text{s}^{-1}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{s} $$\nConverting to microseconds:\n$$ \\Delta t = 5.0 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{s} \\times \\frac{10^6~\\mu\\text{s}}{1~\\text{s}} = 5.000~\\mu\\text{s} $$\nThe result is given to four significant figures as required.\n\nSecond, the k-space sampling increment $\\Delta k_x$ is determined by the Field of View along the x-direction, $F_x$, according to the Nyquist sampling theorem for images:\n$$ \\Delta k_x = \\frac{1}{F_x} $$\nWe now have two expressions for $\\Delta k_x$. Equating them allows us to solve for $G_x$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{F_x} = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x \\Delta t \\implies G_x = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\gamma F_x \\Delta t} $$\nWe can check the consistency with the problem's condition on $k_{x,\\max}$. The resolution $\\Delta x$ is given by $\\Delta x = F_x / N_x$. The condition is $k_{x,\\max} = 1/(2\\Delta x) = N_x/(2F_x)$. For a symmetric acquisition of $N_x$ samples, the k-space trajectory spans from $-k_{x,\\max}$ to $+k_{x,\\max}$. The total k-space range is $2k_{x,\\max} = N_x \\Delta k_x$. This gives $k_{x,\\max} = N_x \\Delta k_x / 2 = N_x / (2F_x)$, which is identical to the condition given in the problem. The condition is therefore satisfied if the relationship $\\Delta k_x=1/F_x$ is met, confirming the problem's internal consistency.\n\nNow we compute the value of $G_x$. Using $\\bar{\\gamma} = \\gamma/(2\\pi) = 42.577 \\times 10^6~\\text{Hz T}^{-1}$, the formula for $G_x$ simplifies to:\n$$ G_x = \\frac{1}{\\bar{\\gamma} F_x \\Delta t} $$\nSubstitute the given values:\n$$ G_x = \\frac{1}{(42.577 \\times 10^6~\\text{s}^{-1}~\\text{T}^{-1}) \\times (0.256~\\text{m}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{s})} $$\n$$ G_x = \\frac{1}{42.577 \\times 0.256 \\times 5.0 \\times 10^6 \\times 10^{-6}}~\\frac{\\text{T}}{\\text{m}} $$\n$$ G_x = \\frac{1}{54.49856}~\\frac{\\text{T}}{\\text{m}} \\approx 0.0183492~\\frac{\\text{T}}{\\text{m}} $$\nThe problem asks for the result in millitesla per meter (mT/m).\n$$ G_x = 0.0183492~\\frac{\\text{T}}{\\text{m}} \\times \\frac{1000~\\text{mT}}{1~\\text{T}} \\approx 18.3492~\\frac{\\text{mT}}{\\text{m}} $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$ G_x = 18.35~\\text{mT/m} $$\nThe required acquisition parameters are a gradient amplitude of $G_x = 18.35~\\text{mT/m}$ and a dwell time of $\\Delta t = 5.000~\\mu\\text{s}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 18.35 & 5.000 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4869046"}, {"introduction": "In clinical and research settings, acquiring images as quickly as possible is paramount.

Derivation of the ghost-to-signal magnitude ratio.\n\nWe decompose the modulation function $P(m)$ into its constant and alternating components:\n$$\nP(m) = C_0 + C_1(-1)^m\n$$\nFor an even index $m$, $(-1)^m = 1$, so we have $P(m) = C_0 + C_1 = \\exp(j\\phi_e)$.\nFor an odd index $m$, $(-1)^m = -1$, so we have $P(m) = C_0 - C_1 = 1$.\nThis is a system of two linear equations for $C_0$ and $C_1$. Solving the system yields:\n$$\nC_0 = \\frac{1 + \\exp(j\\phi_e)}{2}\n$$\n$$\nC_1 = \\frac{\\exp(j\\phi_e) - 1}{2}\n$$\nThe measured k-space data can now be written as:\n$$\nS_{meas}(m) = [C_0 + C_1(-1)^m] S_{ideal}(m) = C_0 S_{ideal}(m) + C_1 S_{ideal}(m)(-1)^m\n$$\nApplying the Fourier transform to reconstruct the image and using the linearity property, we get:\n$$\nI_{meas}(p) = \\mathcal{F}\\{S_{meas}(m)\\} = C_0 \\mathcal{F}\\{S_{ideal}(m)\\} + C_1 \\mathcal{F}\\{S_{ideal}(m)(-1)^m\\}\n$$\nLetting $I_{ideal}(p) = \\mathcal{F}\\{S_{ideal}(m)\\}$ be the ideal image, and using the shift property derived earlier, we find:\n$$\nI_{meas}(p) = C_0 I_{ideal}(p) + C_1 I_{ideal}(p - N/2)\n$$\nThe reconstructed image is a superposition of two components:\n- The \"signal\" image: $I_{signal}(p) = C_0 I_{ideal}(p)$, which is the desired image scaled by a complex factor $C_0$.\n- The \"ghost\" image: $I_{ghost}(p) = C_1 I_{ideal}(p - N/2)$, which is a copy of the desired image, scaled by $C_1$ and shifted by $N/2$ pixels.\n\nThe ghost-to-signal magnitude ratio, $G/S$, is the ratio of the magnitudes of their respective complex amplitudes, $|C_1|$ and $|C_0|$:\n$$\nG/S = \\frac{|C_1|}{|C_0|} = \\frac{\\left|\\frac{\\exp(j\\phi_e) - 1}{2}\\right|}{\\left|\\frac{1 + \\exp(j\\phi_e)}{2}\\right|} = \\left| \\frac{\\exp(j\\phi_e) - 1}{\\exp(j\\phi_e) + 1} \\right|\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we factor out $\\exp(j\\phi_e/2)$ from the numerator and denominator:\n$$\nG/S = \\left| \\frac{\\exp(j\\phi_e/2) \\left(\\exp(j\\phi_e/2) - \\exp(-j\\phi_e/2)\\right)}{\\exp(j\\phi_e/2) \\left(\\exp(j\\phi_e/2) + \\exp(-j\\phi_e/2)\\right)} \\right|\n$$\nUsing Euler's identities, $\\sin(x) = \\frac{\\exp(jx) - \\exp(-jx)}{2j}$ and $\\cos(x) = \\frac{\\exp(jx) + \\exp(-jx)}{2}$:\n$$\nG/S = \\left| \\frac{2j\\sin(\\phi_e/2)}{2\\cos(\\phi_e/2)} \\right| = \\left| j \\tan(\\phi_e/2) \\right|\n$$\nSince $|j| = 1$, the ratio simplifies to:\n$$\nG/S = \\left| \\tan\\left(\\frac{\\phi_e}{2}\\right) \\right|\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the phase error, $\\phi_e = \\omega_0 \\Delta t - \\phi_c$:\n$$\nG/S = \\left| \\tan\\left(\\frac{\\omega_0 \\Delta t - \\phi_c}{2}\\right) \\right|\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the ghost-to-signal magnitude ratio.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left| \\tan\\left(\\frac{\\omega_0 \\Delta t - \\phi_c}{2}\\right) \\right|}\n$$", "id": "4869065"}]}
