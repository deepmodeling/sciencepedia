This constitutes a severe signal loss, rendering tissues with such a short $T_2^{*}$ value virtually undetectable or \"black\" in a conventional GRE image with a millisecond-range echo time.

For such a short $\\mathrm{TE}$, the ratio $\\mathrm{TE}/T_2^{*}$ would be much less than $1$, and the signal $\\exp(-\\mathrm{TE}/T_2^{*})$ would be close to $1$. This allows UTE to capture a substantial signal from short-$T_2^{*}$ tissues before they dephase, making them visible in the final image.

Numerical evaluation of $\\alpha$ for the given parameters.\n3. Discussion of the constraints on achieving ultrashort pulse durations.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Flip Angle**\n\nThe dynamics of the macroscopic magnetization vector, $\\vec{M}$, in the presence of a magnetic field are described by the Bloch equation. In a reference frame rotating at an angular frequency $\\omega$ about the static magnetic field direction ($\\hat{z}$), and neglecting relaxation effects, the equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\vec{M}}{dt} = \\vec{M} \\times \\gamma \\vec{B}_{\\text{eff}}\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio and $\\vec{B}_{\\text{eff}}$ is the effective magnetic field in the rotating frame.

This condition implies that the rotating frame's frequency $\\omega$ is set to the Larmor frequency, $\\omega_0 = -\\gamma B_0$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\vec{B}_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$\n\\vec{B}_{\\text{eff}} = \\vec{B}_1(t) + \\left( B_0 + \\frac{-\\gamma B_0}{\\gamma} \\right) \\hat{z} = \\vec{B}_1(t) + (B_0 - B_0) \\hat{z} = \\vec{B}_1(t)\n$$\nThe problem states that the RF pulse is linearly polarized along the $\\hat{x}$-axis in the rotating frame, with a constant amplitude $B_1$ for a duration $t_p$. Thus, $\\vec{B}_1(t) = B_1 \\hat{x}$ for $0 \\le t \\le t_p$. The effective magnetic field is constant during the pulse:\n$$\n\\vec{B}_{\\text{eff}} = B_1 \\hat{x}\n$$\nThe Bloch equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\vec{M}}{dt} = \\vec{M} \\times (\\gamma B_1 \\hat{x})\n$$\nThis equation describes the precession of the magnetization vector $\\vec{M}$ about the $\\hat{x}$-axis with an angular frequency $\\omega_1 = \\gamma B_1$.\n\nInitially, at thermal equilibrium ($t=0$), the magnetization is aligned with the static field $\\vec{B}_0$, so $\\vec{M}(0) = M_0 \\hat{z}$. The flip angle, $\\alpha$, is the total angle through which the magnetization vector precesses around the effective field $\\vec{B}_{\\text{eff}}$ during the pulse duration $t_p$. For a constant precession frequency $\\omega_1$, the total angle is simply the product of the frequency and the time duration:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\omega_1 t_p\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\omega_1$, we get the formula for the flip angle:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\gamma B_1 t_p\n$$\nThis is the required expression.

To achieve a specific flip angle $\\alpha$ with an ultrashort pulse duration $t_p$, the RF field amplitude $B_1$ must be proportionally large, as shown by rearranging the formula: $B_1 = \\alpha / (\\gamma t_p)$. This reveals an inverse scaling, $B_1 \\propto 1/t_p$. This requirement imposes significant physical and hardware constraints.\n\n1.  **Hardware Constraints**:\n    - **RF Amplifier Power**: The power required from the RF amplifier to generate the $B_1$ field is proportional to the square of its amplitude, $P \\propto B_1^2$. Since $B_1 \\propto 1/t_p$, the required power scales as $P \\propto (1/t_p)^2$. This quadratic scaling means that halving the pulse duration requires a four-fold increase in RF amplifier power, which can rapidly exceed the capabilities of the MRI system's hardware. This is a primary limitation on achieving shorter pulse durations.\n    - **RF Coil Performance**: The RF coil must be able to withstand the high voltages and currents needed to produce a strong $B_1$ field without overheating or electrical arcing.\n    - **RF Pulse Slew Rate**: An ideal rectangular pulse has infinite slew rate (instantaneous rise and fall times). Real RF systems have finite slew rates. For ultrashort pulses, these finite rise/fall times become a significant fraction of the total pulse duration $t_p$, distorting the pulse shape and leading to inaccuracies in the achieved flip angle and excitation profile.\n\n2.  **Physical and Physiological Constraints**:\n    - **Specific Absorption Rate (SAR)**: SAR is a measure of the rate at which RF energy is absorbed by the body, a critical safety parameter to limit tissue heating. The energy deposited by a single rectangular pulse is proportional to $B_1^2 t_p$. Substituting $B_1 \\propto 1/t_p$, the energy per pulse scales as $E_{\\text{pulse}} \\propto (1/t_p)^2 t_p = 1/t_p$. Thus, for a fixed flip angle, a shorter pulse requires a higher $B_1$ and deposits *more* energy. This can lead to exceeding regulatory SAR limits, especially in sequences involving rapid repetition of pulses.\n    - **Pulse Bandwidth**: According to the principles of Fourier analysis, the bandwidth of a pulse is inversely proportional to its duration ($\\Delta\\omega \\approx 1/t_p$). Ultrashort pulses are therefore inherently broadband (non-selective). While this is the intended function in UTE (to excite species with very short $T_2^*$ relaxation times and thus broad spectral linewidths), the large bandwidth necessitates that the excitation is truly on-resonance across the entire volume of interest to be effective, and places demands on the homogeneity of the main $B_0$ field.\n\nIn summary, the dominant constraints for shortening $t_p$ while maintaining a useful flip angle are the required RF power, which scales as $(1/t_p)^2$, and SAR limitations, as the deposited energy per pulse scales as $1/t_p$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1338}$$", "id": "4939528"}]}
