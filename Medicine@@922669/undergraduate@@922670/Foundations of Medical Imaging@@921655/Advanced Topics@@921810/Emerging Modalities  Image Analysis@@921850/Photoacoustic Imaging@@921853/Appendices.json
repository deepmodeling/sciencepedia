The core physical process involves the rapid, localized heating of the tissue by an optical pulse, followed by thermoelastic expansion that generates a pressure wave. The conditions of thermal and stress confinement are critical assumptions.\n\n1.  **Thermal Confinement**: Assumes the laser pulse duration, $\\tau_p$, is much shorter than the thermal diffusion time, $\\tau_{th}$. This means heat does not have time to conduct away from the absorption volume during the pulse. The heating process is effectively adiabatic.\n2.  **Stress Confinement**: Assumes $\\tau_p$ is much shorter than the acoustic transit time, $\\tau_s$. This means the mechanical stress does not have time to propagate away from the absorption volume during the pulse. The heating process occurs at a constant volume (isochoric).\n\nThese two conditions ensure that the absorbed optical energy is instantaneously and locally converted into a pressure rise.\n\nThe derivation follows these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Absorbed Energy Density**\nThe absorbed energy density per unit volume, $H$ (in units of $\\mathrm{J/m^3}$), is the product of the optical absorption coefficient, $\\mu_a$, and the local optical fluence, $\\Phi$.\n$$H = \\mu_a \\Phi$$\n\n**Step 2: Temperature Rise**\nUnder the specified confinement conditions, the absorbed energy $H$ leads to a rapid temperature rise, $\\Delta T$. This relationship is governed by the volumetric heat capacity of the medium. The heat capacity per unit volume is the product of the mass density, $\\rho$, and the specific heat capacity at constant pressure, $C_p$. We approximate the specific heat at constant volume $C_v$ with $C_p$, which is a valid approximation for condensed matter like soft tissue.\n$$H = \\rho C_p \\Delta T$$\nTherefore, the temperature rise is:\n$$\\Delta T = \\frac{H}{\\rho C_p} = \\frac{\\mu_a \\Phi}{\\rho C_p}$$\n\n**Step 3: Thermoelastic Pressure Generation**\nThe temperature rise $\\Delta T$ induces an instantaneous isotropic thermal expansion. For a linear, isotropic, thermoelastic medium, the volumetric strain due to thermal expansion, $\\epsilon_{th}$, is given by:\n$$\\epsilon_{th} = \\beta \\Delta T$$\nwhere $\\beta$ is the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient.\n\nUnder stress confinement, the medium does not have time to expand. An internal stress, or pressure $p_0$, is generated to oppose this thermal expansion, maintaining a net zero strain. This initial pressure is related to the thermally induced strain and the medium's bulk modulus, $K$, by Hooke's law:\n$$p_0 = K \\epsilon_{th} = K \\beta \\Delta T$$\nThe bulk modulus $K$ is related to the speed of sound, $c$, and the mass density, $\\rho$, by the fundamental acoustic relation:\n$$K = \\rho c^2$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $p_0$:\n$$p_0 = (\\rho c^2) \\beta \\Delta T$$\n\n**Step 4: Combined Expression for Initial Pressure**\nWe combine the equations from the preceding steps to derive a single expression for $p_0$. Substituting the expression for $\\Delta T$ from Step 2 into the expression for $p_0$ from Step 3:\n$$p_0 = (\\rho c^2) \\beta \\left( \\frac{\\mu_a \\Phi}{\\rho C_p} \\right)$$\nThe mass density, $\\rho$, cancels from the numerator and denominator.
