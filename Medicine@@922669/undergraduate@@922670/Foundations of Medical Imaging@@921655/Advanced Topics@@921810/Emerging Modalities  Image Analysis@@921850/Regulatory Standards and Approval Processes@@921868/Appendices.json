The values provided are realistic, and the premises are consistent and sufficient to construct a solution. The problem is well-posed and objective. Thus, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Mechanical Index (MI) Dependence**\n\nThe Mechanical Index is defined as an indicator of the relative likelihood of inertial cavitation. Cavitation is a phenomenon driven by the acoustic pressure field, and it occurs when the pressure exceeds a certain threshold, $P_{th}$. The MI, therefore, must be a measure of the applied acoustic pressure relative to this threshold.\n\n1.  The applied pressure is given by the derated peak rarefactional pressure, $P_{r.3}$. The likelihood of cavitation increases with this pressure, so we can state that the MI is directly proportional to $P_{r.3}$:\n    $$ \\text{MI} \\propto P_{r.3} $$\n\n2.  The resistance to cavitation is represented by the cavitation threshold pressure, $P_{th}$. The problem states that this threshold increases with the square root of the acoustic frequency, $f$.\n    $$ P_{th} \\propto \\sqrt{f} $$\n\n3.  The MI, as a measure of the likelihood of a pressure-driven effect, should be proportional to the ratio of the driving pressure to the threshold pressure. A higher ratio implies a greater likelihood of exceeding the threshold.\n    $$ \\text{MI} \\propto \\frac{\\text{Driving Pressure}}{\\text{Threshold Pressure}} \\propto \\frac{P_{r.3}}{P_{th}} $$\n\n4.  Substituting the frequency dependence of $P_{th}$ into this proportionality, we obtain the functional dependence of MI on $P_{r.3}$ and $f$:\n    $$ \\text{MI} \\propto \\frac{P_{r.3}}{\\sqrt{f}} $$\n    This relationship is consistent with the problem's requirements: MI increases with $P_{r.3}$ and decreases with $f$.\n\n5.  To make this an equation, we introduce a constant of proportionality, $k$:\n    $$ \\text{MI} = k \\frac{P_{r.3}}{\\sqrt{f}} $$\n    The problem specifies that MI is a dimensionless quantity. The units of $P_{r.3}$ are pressure (Pascals, Pa), and the units of $f$ are frequency (Hertz, Hz). The constant $k$ would need to have units of $(\\text{Pa}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}})^{-1}$ to render the MI dimensionless. However, in the context of regulatory standards, it is common to use a mixed-unit equation where the constant is implicitly set to $1$ by a specific choice of units. The standard definition of the Mechanical Index, adopted by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, is precisely of this form:\n    $$ \\text{MI} = \\frac{P_{r.3} [\\text{MPa}]}{\\sqrt{f [\\text{MHz}]}} $$\n    Here, it is understood that $P_{r.3}$ must be expressed in units of megapascals ($1 \\text{ MPa} = 10^6 \\text{ Pa}$) and $f$ must be expressed in units of megahertz ($1 \\text{ MHz} = 10^6 \\text{ Hz}$). This formula is the standard used for regulatory assessment and is the one we must use for the calculation.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of MI for the Probe**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n-   $P_{r.3} = 1.5 \\text{ MPa}$\n-   $f_c = 2 \\text{ MHz}$ (using $f_c$ to denote the center frequency)\n\nSubstituting these values into the standard MI formula:\n$$ \\text{MI} = \\frac{1.5}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\text{MI} = \\frac{1.5}{1.41421356...} \\approx 1.06066017... $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the computed MI to $4$ significant figures.\n$$ \\text{MI} \\approx 1.061 $$\n\n**Part 3: Compliance Assessment**\n\nThe final step is to assess whether the probe's acoustic output complies with the FDA's limit for obstetric imaging.\n-   Calculated MI: $1.061$\n-   Regulatory upper limit for obstetric imaging: $1.9$\n\nWe compare the calculated value to the limit:\n$$ 1.061  1.9 $$\nSince the calculated Mechanical Index of the probe is less than the maximum permissible value of $1.9$, the probe is in compliance with the FDA regulatory standard for obstetric use.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.061}$$", "id": "4918966"}, {"introduction": "Beyond intrinsic safety indices, regulators require that the dose information presented to clinical users is accurate.
