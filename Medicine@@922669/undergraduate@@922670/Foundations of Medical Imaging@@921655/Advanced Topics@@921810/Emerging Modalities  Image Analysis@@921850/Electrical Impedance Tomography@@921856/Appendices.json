The voltmeter front end can be modeled as having an input-referred white voltage noise spectral density $S_{v}$ (RMS per square-root Hertz) and a measurement bandwidth $B$ set by synchronous detection around the drive frequency.

The calculation proceeds from first principles.\n\n**1. Signal Amplitude Calculation**\nThe signal is the RMS voltage, $|V|$, generated at the measurement electrodes. According to Ohm's law applied to impedances, this voltage is the product of the RMS drive current magnitude, $|I|$, and the transfer impedance magnitude, $|Z_t|$.\n$$|V| = |I| |Z_t|$$\nUsing the provided values:\n-   Drive current amplitude $|I| = 1.0~\\mathrm{mA} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{A}$.\n-   Transfer impedance magnitude $|Z_t| = 0.200~\\Omega$.\n\nThe signal RMS voltage is:\n$$|V| = (1.0 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{A}) \\times (0.200~\\Omega) = 0.200 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{V} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{V}$$\n\n**2. Noise Amplitude Calculation**\nThe noise is modeled as input-referred white voltage noise with a spectral density $S_v$. The total RMS noise voltage, $V_{n, \\mathrm{rms}}$, in a measurement bandwidth $B$ is given by the relation:\n$$V_{n, \\mathrm{rms}} = S_v \\sqrt{B}$$\nUsing the provided values:\n-   Noise spectral density $S_v = 100~\\mathrm{nV}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-7}~\\mathrm{V}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$.\n-   Measurement bandwidth $B = 200~\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nThe RMS noise voltage for a single measurement ($N=1$) is:\n$$V_{n, \\mathrm{rms}} = (1.00 \\times 10^{-7}~\\mathrm{V}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}) \\times \\sqrt{200~\\mathrm{Hz}} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-7} \\times 10\\sqrt{2}~\\mathrm{V} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{V}$$\nNumerically, this is approximately $V_{n, \\mathrm{rms}} \\approx 1.4142 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{V}$.\n\n**3. SNR Calculation**\nThe Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is defined as the ratio of signal power to noise power. For voltage signals measured across the same impedance, this is equivalent to the square of the ratio of their RMS amplitudes. However, a common convention in signal processing, which we adopt here, is to express SNR as the ratio of the RMS signal amplitude to the RMS noise amplitude.\n$$\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{amp}} = \\frac{|V|}{V_{n, \\mathrm{rms}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for the signal and noise amplitudes:\n$$\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{amp}} = \\frac{2.00 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{V}}{\\sqrt{2} \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{V}} = \\frac{2.00 \\times 10^2}{\\sqrt{2}} = 100\\sqrt{2}$$\nNumerically, $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{amp}} \\approx 141.42$.\n\n**4.

Derivation of the Expression**\nThe signal of interest for this detection problem is the change in voltage, $|\\Delta V|$, caused by a small change in the transfer impedance, $|\\Delta Z|$. From Ohm's law, assuming the drive current $|I|$ is constant, this relationship is:\n$$|\\Delta V| = |I| |\\Delta Z|$$\nThe noise that limits the detection of this signal is the averaged RMS noise voltage, $V_{n, \\mathrm{avg}}$.

The total impedance is composed of three elements connected in series: the first electrode-skin interface, the bulk tissue, and the second electrode-skin interface.\n\nFirst, we define the impedance of a single electrode-skin interface, $z_{\\ell}(\\omega)$. The problem states this is a series combination of a contact resistance $r_{\\ell}$ and a capacitance $c_{\\ell}$.\n\nThe impedance of a resistor is its resistance, which is a real number. So, the impedance of the contact resistance is $r_{\\ell}$.\n\nThe impedance of a capacitor with capacitance $c_{\\ell}$ at an angular frequency $\\omega$ is a complex quantity given by:\n$$\nZ_{c} = \\frac{1}{j \\omega c_{\\ell}}\n$$\nwhere $j$ is the imaginary unit, defined as $j = \\sqrt{-1}$.\n\nSince the resistance $r_{\\ell}$ and capacitance $c_{\\ell}$ are in series for a single electrode interface, their impedances add up. The impedance of one electrode, $z_{\\ell}(\\omega)$, is:\n$$\nz_{\\ell}(\\omega) = r_{\\ell} + \\frac{1}{j \\omega c_{\\ell}}\n$$\n\nThe total circuit consists of the first electrode, the tissue bulk, and the second electrode, all in series.

We use the identity $\\frac{1}{j} = -j$:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\omega) = (R_{t} + 2r_{\\ell}) + \\frac{2}{j \\omega c_{\\ell}} = (R_{t} + 2r_{\\ell}) - j \\frac{2}{\\omega c_{\\ell}}\n$$\n\nFrom this form, we can identify the real and imaginary parts of the total transfer impedance:\nThe real part is $\\mathrm{Re}(Z_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\omega)) = R_{t} + 2r_{\\ell}$.\nThe imaginary part is $\\mathrm{Im}(Z_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\omega)) = -\\frac{2}{\\omega c_{\\ell}}$.\n\nThe phase shift $\\phi(\\omega)$ is the argument of the complex impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\omega)$.

Substituting the expressions for $J_{z}$ and $C_{z}$:\n$$ C_{y}^{(z)} = (DQ) (s_{z}^{2} I_{E}) (DQ)^{\\top} = s_{z}^{2} (DQ) (Q^{\\top} D^{\\top}) $$\nSince $Q$ is a diagonal matrix, it is symmetric, so $Q^{\\top} = Q$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$ C_{y}^{(z)} = s_{z}^{2} D Q Q D^{\\top} = s_{z}^{2} D Q^{2} D^{\\top} $$\nwhere $Q^{2} = \\mathrm{diag}(q_{1}^{2}, \\dots, q_{E}^{2})$. This is the explicit expression for the data covariance matrix in terms of $D$, $Q$, and $s_{z}$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Effective Noise Floor $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}}$**\n\nThe effective noise floor is defined as:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\equiv \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{E}\\,\\mathrm{tr}\\!\\left(C_{y}^{(z)}\\right)} $$\nFirst, we compute the trace of $C_{y}^{(z)}$. Using the cyclic property of the trace, $\\mathrm{tr}(ABC) = \\mathrm{tr}(CAB)$:\n$$ \\mathrm{tr}\\!\\left(C_{y}^{(z)}\\right) = \\mathrm{tr}\\!\\left(s_{z}^{2} D Q^{2} D^{\\top}\\right) = s_{z}^{2} \\mathrm{tr}\\!\\left(D^{\\top} D Q^{2}\\right) $$\nLet's analyze the matrix product $D^{\\top}D$. The $(k,k)$-th diagonal element is given by the sum of squares of the elements in the $k$-th column of $D$. For any column $k$ of the circulant matrix $D$, there are exactly two non-zero elements: one $1$ and one $-1$. Thus, the diagonal elements are:\n$$ (D^{\\top}D)_{kk} = (1)^{2} + (-1)^{2} = 2 $$\nfor all $k = 1, \\dots, E$.\nThe trace of the product of two matrices $A$ and $B$, where $B$ is diagonal, is $\\mathrm{tr}(AB) = \\sum_{k} A_{kk} B_{kk}$. Here, $A=D^{\\top}D$ and $B=Q^2$.\n$$ \\mathrm{tr}\\!\\left((D^{\\top} D) Q^{2}\\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^{E} (D^{\\top}D)_{kk} (Q^{2})_{kk} = \\sum_{k=1}^{E} 2 q_{k}^{2} = 2 \\sum_{k=1}^{E} q_{k}^{2} $$\nTherefore, the trace of the covariance matrix is:\n$$ \\mathrm{tr}\\!\\left(C_{y}^{(z)}\\right) = 2 s_{z}^{2} \\sum_{k=1}^{E} q_{k}^{2} $$\nNow we use the specific current pattern provided: $q_{1} = +I_{0}/A_{e}$, $q_{9} = -I_{0}/A_{e}$, and $q_{\\ell}=0$ for all other electrodes. The sum of squared current densities is:\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{E} q_{k}^{2} = q_{1}^{2} + q_{9}^{2} + \\sum_{\\ell \\neq 1,9} q_{\\ell}^{2} = \\left(\\frac{I_{0}}{A_{e}}\\right)^{2} + \\left(-\\frac{I_{0}}{A_{e}}\\right)^{2} + 0 = 2\\left(\\frac{I_{0}}{A_{e}}\\right)^{2} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the trace:\n$$ \\mathrm{tr}\\!\\left(C_{y}^{(z)}\\right) = 2 s_{z}^{2} \\left(2\\left(\\frac{I_{0}}{A_{e}}\\right)^{2}\\right) = 4 s_{z}^{2} \\left(\\frac{I_{0}}{A_{e}}\\right)^{2} $$\nNow we can compute $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{E} \\left(4 s_{z}^{2} \\left(\\frac{I_{0}}{A_{e}}\\right)^{2}\\right)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{E}} s_{z} \\frac{I_{0}}{A_{e}} = \\frac{2 s_{z} I_{0}}{A_{e} \\sqrt{E}} $$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the effective noise floor.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression numerically with the given values:\n$E = 16$, $I_{0} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{A}$, $A_{e} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}$, and $s_{z} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\Omega\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{m}^{2}$.\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{2 \\times (1.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\Omega\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathrm{m}^{2}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{A})}{(1.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}) \\times \\sqrt{16}} $$\nThe term $1.5 \\times 10^{-4}$ cancels in the numerator and denominator. $\\sqrt{16}=4$.\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{2 \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V})}{4} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V}}{4} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V} $$\nThe problem asks for the result in millivolts ($\\mathrm{mV}$).\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{mV} $$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, the result is $1.00\\ \\mathrm{mV}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1.00} $$", "id": "4881494"}]}
