The OCT system is based on a Michelson interferometer. In this setup, light from a low-coherence source is split into two paths: a reference arm and a sample arm. The light in the reference arm reflects from a mirror, while the light in the sample arm reflects from the glass slide. The reflected light from both arms is then recombined at a detector.\n\nTo perform a depth scan (known as an A-scan), the reference mirror is moved along the optical axis at a constant velocity, $v_m$. An interferometric signal is generated at the detector only when the optical path length of the reference arm is nearly identical to the optical path length of the sample arm. During a scan of one particular slide, the system's detector registers two distinct, sharp interference peaks. The first peak, corresponding to the reflection from the top surface of the slide, is detected at time $t_1 = 1.25$ ms. The second peak, corresponding to the reflection from the bottom surface, is detected at time $t_2 = 4.28$ ms. The reference mirror moves at a constant velocity of $v_m = 0.500$ m/s throughout the scan. The time measurement starts at $t=0$ when the mirror starts moving from its initial position.\n\nCalculate the optical thickness of the glass slide.

The axial point-spread function is governed by Fourier duality between $k$ and $z$: broader support in $k$ produces a narrower coherence envelope in $z$ (higher axial resolution), while discrete sampling in $k$ with spacing $\\Delta k_{\\mathrm{samp}}$ imposes a periodicity in $z$ that determines the unambiguous imaging range.\n\nAxial resolution versus bandwidth.

Then the sample spacing is $\\Delta k_{\\mathrm{samp}} = \\Delta k_{\\mathrm{tot}}/N$. The discrete sum with kernel $\\exp(i\\,2 k z)$ is periodic in $z$ with period $Z_{\\mathrm{p}}$ determined by requiring the phase increment between adjacent $k$-samples to accumulate $2\\pi$ over one period:\n$$\n2\\,\\Delta k_{\\mathrm{samp}}\\,Z_{\\mathrm{p}} = 2\\pi \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad Z_{\\mathrm{p}} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\Delta k_{\\mathrm{samp}}}.\n$$\nFor real-valued detection (no quadrature), the Fourier transform exhibits Hermitian symmetry that mirrors positive and negative depths; consequently, the unambiguous imaging range before mirror overlap is half the $z$-period:\n$$\nz_{\\max} = \\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{p}}}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2\\,\\Delta k_{\\mathrm{samp}}} = \\frac{\\pi\\,N}{2\\,\\Delta k_{\\mathrm{tot}}}.\n$$\nTherefore, at fixed $N$, increasing the total $k$-span $\\Delta k_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ reduces $z_{\\max}$.\n\nNumerical evaluation.
