Derivatives of PPV and NPV with respect to p**\n\nTo find the derivative of $PPV$ with respect to $p$, we use the quotient rule for differentiation.\nLet $u(p) = (TPR)p$ and $v(p) = (TPR)p + (FPR)(1-p) = (TPR - FPR)p + FPR$.\nThen $u'(p) = TPR$ and $v'(p) = TPR - FPR$.\n$$\\frac{d\\,PPV}{dp} = \\frac{u'(p)v(p) - u(p)v'(p)}{[v(p)]^2} = \\frac{(TPR)[(TPR - FPR)p + FPR] - (TPR)p[TPR - FPR]}{[(TPR)p + (FPR)(1-p)]^2}$$\n$$\\frac{d\\,PPV}{dp} = \\frac{(TPR)^2 p - (TPR)(FPR)p + (TPR)(FPR) - (TPR)^2 p + (TPR)(FPR)p}{[(TPR)p + (FPR)(1-p)]^2}$$\n$$\\frac{d\\,PPV}{dp} = \\frac{(TPR)(FPR)}{[(TPR)p + (FPR)(1-p)]^2}$$\nFor the conditions $0 < p < 1$, $0 < TPR < 1$, and $0 < FPR < 1$, the numerator $(TPR)(FPR)$ is positive. The denominator is a squared term representing $[P(T)]^2$. Since $P(T)$ cannot be zero under these conditions, the denominator is also positive. Therefore, $\\frac{d\\,PPV}{dp} > 0$. This indicates that $PPV$ is a monotonically increasing function of prevalence $p$. A higher prevalence in a subgroup leads to a higher $PPV$.\n\nTo find the derivative of $NPV$ with respect to $p$, we again use the quotient rule.\nLet $u(p) = (1-FPR)(1-p)$ and $v(p) = (1-TPR)p + (1-FPR)(1-p) = (FPR-TPR)p + (1-FPR)$.\nThen $u'(p) = -(1-FPR)$ and $v'(p) = FPR-TPR$.\n$$\\frac{d\\,NPV}{dp} = \\frac{u'(p)v(p) - u(p)v'(p)}{[v(p)]^2} = \\frac{-(1-FPR)[(FPR-TPR)p + (1-FPR)] - (1-FPR)(1-p)[FPR-TPR]}{[(1-TPR)p + (1-FPR)(1-p)]^2}$$\nFactor out $-(1-FPR)$ from the numerator:\n$$\\frac{d\\,NPV}{dp} = \\frac{-(1-FPR) \\left\\{ [(FPR-TPR)p + (1-FPR)] + (1-p)[-(TPR-FPR)] \\right\\}}{[P(T^c)]^2}$$\n$$\\frac{d\\,NPV}{dp} = \\frac{-(1-FPR) \\{ (FPR-TPR)p + (1-FPR) + (p-1)(TPR-FPR) \\}}{[P(T^c)]^2}$$\n$$\\frac{d\\,NPV}{dp} = \\frac{-(1-FPR) \\{ (FPR-TPR)p + 1-FPR + p(TPR-FPR) - (TPR-FPR) \\}}{[P(T^c)]^2}$$\n$$\\frac{d\\,NPV}{dp} = \\frac{-(1-FPR) \\{ 1 - FPR - TPR + FPR \\}}{[P(T^c)]^2} = \\frac{-(1-FPR)(1-TPR)}{[P(T^c)]^2}$$\n$$\\frac{d\\,NPV}{dp} = \\frac{-(1-TPR)(1-FPR)}{[(1-TPR)p + (1-FPR)(1-p)]^2}$$\nFor the conditions $0 < p < 1$, $0 < TPR < 1$, and $0 < FPR < 1$, the terms $(1-TPR)$ and $(1-FPR)$ are both positive. Thus, the numerator $-(1-TPR)(1-FPR)$ is negative. The denominator is $[P(T^c)]^2$, which is positive. Therefore, $\\frac{d\\,NPV}{dp} < 0$. This indicates that $NPV$ is a monotonically decreasing function of prevalence $p$. A higher prevalence in a subgroup leads to a lower $NPV$.

Substituting the expression for TPR, we get:\n$$1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\theta_A - \\mu_{1A}}{\\sigma}\\right) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\theta_B - \\mu_{1B}}{\\sigma}\\right)$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\theta_A - \\mu_{1A}}{\\sigma}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\theta_B - \\mu_{1B}}{\\sigma}\\right)$$\nSince the standard normal CDF, $\\Phi$, is a strictly increasing function, its inverse is unique. This implies that the arguments of the function must be equal:\n$$\\frac{\\theta_A - \\mu_{1A}}{\\sigma} = \\frac{\\theta_B - \\mu_{1B}}{\\sigma}$$\nAssuming $\\sigma > 0$, we can multiply both sides by $\\sigma$ to obtain a linear constraint on the thresholds $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$:\n$$\\theta_A - \\mu_{1A} = \\theta_B - \\mu_{1B}$$\n$$\\theta_A - \\theta_B = \\mu_{1A} - \\mu_{1B}$$\n\nThe problem is now to find the values of $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ that minimize the objective function $J(\\theta_A, \\theta_B) = (\\theta_A - \\theta_{A0})^2 + (\\theta_B - \\theta_{B0})^2$, subject to the constraint $\\theta_A - \\theta_B = \\mu_{1A} - \\mu_{1B}$. This is a constrained optimization problem that can be solved using the method of Lagrange multipliers.\n\nLet the Lagrangian function $\\mathcal{L}$ be:\n$$\\mathcal{L}(\\theta_A, \\theta_B, \\lambda) = (\\theta_A - \\theta_{A0})^2 + (\\theta_B - \\theta_{B0})^2 - \\lambda(\\theta_A - \\theta_B - (\\mu_{1A} - \\mu_{1B}))$$\nTo find the minimum, we set the partial derivatives of $\\mathcal{L}$ with respect to $\\theta_A$, $\\theta_B$, and $\\lambda$ to zero:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\theta_A} = 2(\\theta_A - \\theta_{A0}) - \\lambda = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\lambda = 2(\\theta_A - \\theta_{A0})$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\theta_B} = 2(\\theta_B - \\theta_{B0}) + \\lambda = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\lambda = -2(\\theta_B - \\theta_{B0})$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\lambda} = -(\\theta_A - \\theta_B - \\mu_{1A} + \\mu_{1B}) = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\theta_A - \\theta_B = \\mu_{1A} - \\mu_{1B}$$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\lambda$:\n$$2(\\theta_A - \\theta_{A0}) = -2(\\theta_B - \\theta_{B0})$$\n$$\\theta_A - \\theta_{A0} = -(\\theta_B - \\theta_{B0})$$\n$$\\theta_A + \\theta_B = \\theta_{A0} + \\theta_{B0}$$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$:\n1. $\\theta_A + \\theta_B = \\theta_{A0} + \\theta_{B0}$\n2. $\\theta_A - \\theta_B = \\mu_{1A} - \\mu_{1B}$\n\nAdding the two equations yields:\n$$2\\theta_A = \\theta_{A0} + \\theta_{B0} + \\mu_{1A} - \\mu_{1B}$$\n$$\\theta_A = \\frac{1}{2}(\\theta_{A0} + \\theta_{B0} + \\mu_{1A} - \\mu_{1B})$$\nSubtracting the second equation from the first yields:\n$$2\\theta_B = \\theta_{A0} + \\theta_{B0} - (\\mu_{1A} - \\mu_{1B})$$\n$$\\theta_B = \\frac{1}{2}(\\theta_{A0} + \\theta_{B0} - \\mu_{1A} + \\mu_{1B})$$\nThese are the closed-form expressions for the parity-constrained optimal thresholds.\n\nNext, we derive the threshold adjustments $\\Delta \\theta_A = \\theta_A - \\theta_{A0}$ and $\\Delta \\theta_B = \\theta_B - \\theta_{B0}$:\n$$\\Delta \\theta_A = \\frac{1}{2}(\\theta_{A0} + \\theta_{B0} + \\mu_{1A} - \\mu_{1B}) - \\theta_{A0} = \\frac{1}{2}(-\\theta_{A0} + \\theta_{B0} + \\mu_{1A} - \\mu_{1B}) = \\frac{1}{2}((\\mu_{1A} - \\mu_{1B}) - (\\theta_{A0} - \\theta_{B0}))$$\n$$\\Delta \\theta_B = \\frac{1}{2}(\\theta_{A0} + \\theta_{B0} - \\mu_{1A} + \\mu_{1B}) - \\theta_{B0} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\theta_{A0} - \\theta_{B0} - \\mu_{1A} + \\mu_{1B}) = -\\frac{1}{2}((\\mu_{1A} - \\mu_{1B}) - (\\theta_{A0} - \\theta_{B0}))$$\nNote that $\\Delta \\theta_A = -\\Delta \\theta_B$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical values for the adjustments using the given parameters: $\\mu_{1A} = 2.2$, $\\mu_{1B} = 1.4$, $\\theta_{A0} = 1.3$, and $\\theta_{B0} = 1.1$.\nFirst, calculate the difference in means and the difference in baseline thresholds:\n$$\\mu_{1A} - \\mu_{1B} = 2.2 - 1.4 = 0.8$$\n$$\\theta_{A0} - \\theta_{B0} = 1.3 - 1.1 = 0.2$$\nNow, substitute these values into the expressions for $\\Delta \\theta_A$ and $\\Delta \\theta_B$:\n$$\\Delta \\theta_A = \\frac{1}{2}(0.8 - 0.2) = \\frac{1}{2}(0.6) = 0.3$$\n$$\\Delta \\theta_B = -\\Delta \\theta_A = -0.3$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$\\Delta \\theta_A = 0.3000$\n$\\Delta \\theta_B = -0.3000$\nThe final answer is expressed as the row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta \\theta_{A} & \\Delta \\theta_{B} \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.3000  -0.3000 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4883687"}]}
