Thus, the concentration of free receptors is $[R] = [R_T] - [LR]$.\n\nSubstituting this into the rate equation:\n$$ \\frac{d[LR]}{dt} = k_{on}[L]([R_T] - [LR]) - k_{off}[LR] $$\nThe problem states that $[L]$ is constant. We can rearrange the equation by grouping terms related to $[LR]$:\n$$ \\frac{d[LR]}{dt} = k_{on}[L][R_T] - (k_{on}[L] + k_{off})[LR] $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. To simplify, we define the receptor occupancy $\\theta$ as the fraction of occupied receptors, $\\theta(t) = \\frac{[LR](t)}{[R_T]}$. Then, $\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\frac{1}{[R_T]}\\frac{d[LR]}{dt}$.

A small $k_{off}$ signifies slow dissociation, meaning the ligand is \"trapped\" on the receptor. This low reversibility is desirable for PET imaging as it leads to high signal retention in the target tissue relative to background clearance, improving image contrast.\n\nHowever, the rate of approach to equilibrium is determined by $k_{obs}$. If $k_{off}$ is very small, the observed rate constant $k_{obs}$ is also small (since $k_{on}$ is related to $k_{off}$ via $K_d$). A small $k_{obs}$ implies a large time constant $\\tau$. A system with a large time constant approaches equilibrium very slowly.\n\nThe trade-off is therefore as follows:\n- **Low Reversibility (small $k_{off}$):** This is advantageous for achieving high signal retention (trapping effect). However, because $\\tau = 1/k_{obs}$ becomes large, the time required to reach a substantial fraction of the maximum possible signal ($\\theta_{eq}$) is very long. This necessitates a long imaging window, which may be clinically impractical or lead to images taken at early times reflecting kinetic delivery more than true receptor density.\n- **High Reversibility (large $k_{off}$):** The system reaches equilibrium quickly because $k_{obs}$ is large (and $\\tau$ is small). This allows for a shorter imaging window. However, the signal may not be retained as strongly, and quantifying receptor density can be more complex if washout from the target tissue is rapid.\n\nIn essence, the desire for an irreversibly bound tracer (small $k_{off}$) to maximize signal retention is in direct conflict with the practical need for a short imaging time, as a small $k_{off}$ inherently slows the kinetics of signal accumulation.\n\n### Calculation\n\nWe need to find the time $t$ at which the receptor occupancy reaches $90\\%$ of its equilibrium value.\n$$ \\theta(t) = 0.90 \\times \\theta_{eq} $$\nSubstituting this into the derived time course equation:\n$$ 0.90 \\times \\theta_{eq} = \\theta_{eq}(1 - \\exp(-k_{obs}t)) $$\n$$ 0.90 = 1 - \\exp(-k_{obs}t) $$\n$$ \\exp(-k_{obs}t) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10 $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -k_{obs}t = \\ln(0.10) = -\\ln(10) $$\n$$ t = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{k_{obs}} $$\nWe need to calculate $k_{obs} = k_{on}[L] + k_{off}$. First, we find $k_{on}$ from the given constants $K_d$ and $k_{off}$:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{k_{off}}{k_{on}} \\implies k_{on} = \\frac{k_{off}}{K_d} $$\nThe given values are:\n- $[L] = 15$ nM\n- $K_d = 5$ nM\n- $k_{off} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ s$^{-1}$\n\nCalculate $k_{on}$:\n$$ k_{on} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ s}^{-1}}{5 \\text{ nM}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ nM}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1} $$\nNow, calculate $k_{obs}$:\n$$ k_{obs} = k_{on}[L] + k_{off} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ nM}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1})(15 \\text{ nM}) + (1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ s}^{-1}) $$\n$$ k_{obs} = (30.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ s}^{-1}) + (1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ s}^{-1}) $$\n$$ k_{obs} = (3.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ s}^{-1}) + (1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ s}^{-1}) = 4.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ s}^{-1} $$\nFinally, calculate the time $t$:\n$$ t = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{4.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ s}^{-1}} \\approx \\frac{2.302585}{4.0 \\times 10^{-4}} \\text{ s} \\approx 5756.46 \\text{ s} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested:\n$$ t = 5756 \\text{ s} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5756}$$", "id": "4931383"}]}
