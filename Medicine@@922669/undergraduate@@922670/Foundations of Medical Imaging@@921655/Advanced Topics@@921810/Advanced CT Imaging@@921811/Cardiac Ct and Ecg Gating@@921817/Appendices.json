The gantry completes a full rotation of $360^{\\circ}$ in the time $T$. The angular speed is therefore:\n$$ \\omega = \\frac{360^{\\circ}}{T} $$\nThe problem states that for exact half-scan fan-beam reconstruction, a minimum angular range of projections, $\\Delta\\theta_{min}$, is required. This range is given by:\n$$ \\Delta\\theta_{min} = 180^{\\circ} + \\Phi $$\nWith the given full fan angle $\\Phi = 50^{\\circ}$, the minimum required angular range is:\n$$ \\Delta\\theta_{min} = 180^{\\circ} + 50^{\\circ} = 230^{\\circ} $$\nThe effective temporal resolution, $\\Delta t_{eff}$, is defined as the time required to acquire this angular range. Since the rotation is uniform, the time is the ratio of the required angle to the angular speed:\n$$ \\Delta t_{eff} = \\frac{\\Delta\\theta_{min}}{\\omega} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Delta\\theta_{min}$ and $\\omega$:\n$$ \\Delta t_{eff} = \\frac{180^{\\circ} + \\Phi}{\\frac{360^{\\circ}}{T}} = T \\left( \\frac{180^{\\circ} + \\Phi}{360^{\\circ}} \\right) $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values, $T = 280\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ and $\\Phi = 50^{\\circ}$:\n$$ \\Delta t_{eff} = (280\\,\\mathrm{ms}) \\left( \\frac{180^{\\circ} + 50^{\\circ}}{360^{\\circ}} \\right) = (280\\,\\mathrm{ms}) \\left( \\frac{230}{360} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta t_{eff} = 280 \\times \\frac{23}{36}\\,\\mathrm{ms} = \\frac{70 \\times 23}{9}\\,\\mathrm{ms} = \\frac{1610}{9}\\,\\mathrm{ms} $$\nThe numerical value is $\\Delta t_{eff} \\approx 178.888... \\,\\mathrm{ms}$. Rounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$ \\Delta t_{eff} \\approx 178.9\\,\\mathrm{ms} $$\n\nSecond, we calculate the motion blur distance, $d_{blur}$.\nThis is defined as the product of the object's speed, $v$, and the effective temporal resolution, $\\Delta t_{eff}$.\n$$ d_{blur} = v \\times \\Delta t_{eff} $$\nThe given speed is $v = 20\\,\\mathrm{mm/s}$.

We will proceed by first deriving a formula for motion blur, then using it to analyze specific scenarios, and finally proposing an optimal acquisition window width.\n\nFirst, we establish the parameters of the cardiac motion. The heart rate is given as $\\mathrm{HR} = 75\\,\\mathrm{bpm}$. The period of one cardiac cycle, $T$, is therefore:\n$$T = \\frac{60\\,\\mathrm{s}}{75} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe corresponding angular frequency, $\\omega$, of the cardiac motion is:\n$$\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{T} = \\frac{2\\pi}{0.8\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 2.5\\pi\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n\n**1. Derivation of the Root-Mean-Square Motion Blur, $B_{\\mathrm{RMS}}(W)$**\n\nThe position of the coronary segment is modeled as one-dimensional sinusoidal motion:\n$$x(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$$\nThe velocity is given by the time derivative of the position:\n$$v(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt} = -A\\omega \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$$\nThe acquisition window is centered at time $t_{0}$, which corresponds to mid-diastole, the phase of minimum cardiac motion. This means the velocity $v(t)$ must be minimal at $t=t_{0}$. The minimum absolute velocity is zero. Thus, we must have $v(t_{0}) = 0$.\n$$-A\\omega \\sin(\\omega t_{0} + \\phi) = 0 \\implies \\omega t_{0} + \\phi = n\\pi, \\quad n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$$\nWithout loss of generality, we can choose our time origin and phase such that $t_{0}=0$ and $\\phi=0$. This choice satisfies the condition $\\omega(0) + 0 = 0$, which is valid for $n=0$. This simplifies the model to:\n$$x(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t)$$\nWith this convention, the center of the gating window is at $t_{0}=0$, and the position at this time is $x(t_{0}) = x(0) = A \\cos(0) = A$. The acquisition occurs over the time interval $[t_0-W/2, t_0+W/2]$, which is $[ -W/2, W/2 ]$.\n\nThe root-mean-square (RMS) motion blur, $B_{\\mathrm{RMS}}(W)$, is defined as:\n$$B_{\\mathrm{RMS}}(W) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{W} \\int_{-W/2}^{W/2} \\left[x(t_{0}+\\tau) - x(t_{0})\\right]^{2}\\,d\\tau}$$\nSubstituting our expressions for $x(t_0+\\tau) = x(\\tau) = A\\cos(\\omega \\tau)$ and $x(t_{0}) = A$:\n$$B_{\\mathrm{RMS}}^2(W) = \\frac{1}{W} \\int_{-W/2}^{W/2} \\left[A\\cos(\\omega \\tau) - A\\right]^{2}\\,d\\tau = \\frac{A^2}{W} \\int_{-W/2}^{W/2} \\left(\\cos(\\omega \\tau) - 1\\right)^{2}\\,d\\tau$$\n\nThe problem asks to state approximations used near mid-diastole. For a short gating window $W$, the values of $\\tau$ in the integration interval are small. Consequently, the argument $\\omega\\tau$ is small. This justifies using a Taylor series expansion for the cosine function around $0$:\n$$\\cos(\\theta) \\approx 1 - \\frac{\\theta^2}{2!} + O(\\theta^4)$$\nApplying this approximation with $\\theta = \\omega\\tau$:\n$$\\cos(\\omega\\tau) - 1 \\approx \\left(1 - \\frac{(\\omega\\tau)^2}{2}\\right) - 1 = -\\frac{\\omega^2\\tau^2}{2}$$\nThis approximation is physically justified because prospective gating aims to use a narrow window around the most quiescent cardiac phase to minimize motion artifacts. The primary model assumption is that coronary motion is sinusoidal, which is itself a simplification of the true complex three-dimensional motion.\n\nSubstituting the approximation into the integrand:\n$$B_{\\mathrm{RMS}}^2(W) \\approx \\frac{A^2}{W} \\int_{-W/2}^{W/2} \\left(-\\frac{\\omega^2\\tau^2}{2}\\right)^2\\,d\\tau = \\frac{A^2\\omega^4}{4W} \\int_{-W/2}^{W/2} \\tau^4\\,d\\tau$$\nWe now perform the integration:\n$$ \\int_{-W/2}^{W/2} \\tau^4\\,d\\tau = \\left[\\frac{\\tau^5}{5}\\right]_{-W/2}^{W/2} = \\frac{(W/2)^5}{5} - \\frac{(-W/2)^5}{5} = 2 \\frac{W^5}{5 \\cdot 32} = \\frac{W^5}{80}$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $B_{\\mathrm{RMS}}^2(W)$:\n$$B_{\\mathrm{RMS}}^2(W) \\approx \\frac{A^2\\omega^4}{4W} \\left(\\frac{W^5}{80}\\right) = \\frac{A^2\\omega^4W^4}{320}$$\nTaking the square root gives the closed-form expression for the RMS motion blur:\n$$B_{\\mathrm{RMS}}(W) \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{A^2\\omega^4W^4}{320}} = \\frac{A\\omega^2W^2}{\\sqrt{320}} = \\frac{A\\omega^2W^2}{8\\sqrt{5}}$$\n\n**2. Calculation and Discussion of Motion Blur**\n\nWe are asked to compute $B_{\\mathrm{RMS}}(W)$ for two window widths, $W_1 = 100\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{s}$ and $W_2 = 200\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{s}$, using $A=3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $\\omega = 2.5\\pi\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nUsing the derived formula for $B_{\\mathrm{RMS}}(W)$:\nFor $W_1 = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{s}$:\n$$B_{\\mathrm{RMS}}(W_1) \\approx \\frac{(3\\,\\mathrm{mm})(2.5\\pi\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})^2(0.1\\,\\mathrm{s})^2}{8\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 6.25 \\pi^2 \\cdot 0.01}{8\\sqrt{5}}\\,\\mathrm{mm} = \\frac{0.1875 \\pi^2}{8\\sqrt{5}}\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n$$B_{\\mathrm{RMS}}(W_1) \\approx \\frac{0.1875 \\cdot 9.8696}{17.8885}\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\approx 0.1034\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nFor $W_2 = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{s}$:\n$$B_{\\mathrm{RMS}}(W_2) \\approx \\frac{(3\\,\\mathrm{mm})(2.5\\pi\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})^2(0.2\\,\\mathrm{s})^2}{8\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 6.25 \\pi^2 \\cdot 0.04}{8\\sqrt{5}}\\,\\mathrm{mm} = \\frac{0.75 \\pi^2}{8\\sqrt{5}}\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n$$B_{\\mathrm{RMS}}(W_2) \\approx \\frac{0.75 \\cdot 9.8696}{17.8885}\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\approx 0.4137\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nDiscussion: According to our derived expression, motion blur $B_{\\mathrm{RMS}}(W)$ is proportional to the square of the window width, $W^2$. When widening the window from $W_1 = 100\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ to $W_2 = 200\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, the width is doubled. Therefore, the motion blur is expected to increase by a factor of $(W_2/W_1)^2 = (2)^2 = 4$. Our calculated values confirm this: $B_{\\mathrm{RMS}}(W_2) / B_{\\mathrm{RMS}}(W_1) \\approx 0.4137 / 0.1034 \\approx 4.0$. This demonstrates a severe trade-off: a wider acquisition window, which might be necessary for other reasons, leads to a rapid degradation of image sharpness due to increased motion blurring.\n\n**3. Quantification of Dose Change**\n\nThe dose model is given as $D(W) \\propto W$, which implies $D(W) = k W$ for some constant of proportionality $k$ that depends on tube current, tube voltage, and other system parameters. We are asked to quantify the change in dose when widening the window from $W_1 = 100\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ to $W_2 = 200\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nThe ratio of the doses is:\n$$\\frac{D(W_2)}{D(W_1)} = \\frac{k W_2}{k W_1} = \\frac{W_2}{W_1} = \\frac{200\\,\\mathrm{ms}}{100\\,\\mathrm{ms}} = 2$$\nThus, doubling the acquisition window width from $100\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ to $200\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ results in a doubling of the patient radiation dose.\n\n**4. Optimal Window Width, $W_{\\mathrm{opt}}$**\n\nThe task is to find an optimal window width, $W_{\\mathrm{opt}}$, that simultaneously minimizes motion blur, $B_{\\mathrm{RMS}}(W)$, and dose, $D(W)$, subject to the gantry angular coverage constraint $W \\geq T_{\\mathrm{rot}}/2$.\n\nWe have established that:\n-   Motion blur $B_{\\mathrm{RMS}}(W) \\propto W^2$. This is a monotonically increasing function of $W$ for $W > 0$.\n-   Dose $D(W) \\propto W$. This is also a monotonically increasing function of $W$.\n\nTo \"simultaneously minimize\" two functions that are both monotonically increasing with respect to the same variable $W$, one must choose the smallest possible value of $W$ that satisfies all constraints. The problem provides the constraint:\n$$W \\geq \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{rot}}}{2}$$\nGiven $T_{\\mathrm{rot}} = 280\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, the constraint is:\n$$W \\geq \\frac{280\\,\\mathrm{ms}}{2} = 140\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\nThe smallest value of $W$ that satisfies this condition is $W = 140\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. This value represents the best possible compromise under the given framework, as any larger value of $W$ would increase both motion blur and radiation dose unnecessarily.\n\nTherefore, the optimal window width is:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{rot}}}{2} = 140\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\nExpressed to four significant figures as required, the optimal window width is $140.0\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{140.0}$$", "id": "4866550"}, {"introduction": "While basic gating assumes a perfectly regular heartbeat, real-world physiology is more complex.
