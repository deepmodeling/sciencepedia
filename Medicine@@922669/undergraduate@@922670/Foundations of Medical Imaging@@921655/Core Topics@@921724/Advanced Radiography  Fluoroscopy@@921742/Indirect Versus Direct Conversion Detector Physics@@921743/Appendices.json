When an X-ray photon is absorbed, its energy $E_{\\mathrm{abs}}$ is converted into visible scintillation photons with a light yield that is proportional to the absorbed energy, described by $Y(E_{\\mathrm{abs}})=S\\,E_{\\mathrm{abs}}$, where $S$ is the light yield constant in units of photons per $\\mathrm{keV}$. The photodiode has a Quantum Efficiency (QE) $q$, defined as the probability that an incident scintillation photon produces one collected electron.

The absorbed X-ray energy $E_{\\mathrm{abs}}$ generates charge carriers with yield set by the pair-creation energy $w$ (energy required to form one electron-hole pair), so the mean number of collected electrons per absorbed photon is $E_{\\mathrm{abs}}/w$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of radiation detector physics, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and expressed in objective, formal language. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness. The problem is valid for solution.\n\nThe task is to derive the effective spectral response $R(E)$ for both an indirect and a direct conversion detector, and then to compute the ratio of these responses at a specific energy $E_{0}$. The spectral response $R(E)$ is defined as the expected number of collected electrons per incident X-ray photon of energy $E$. This can be expressed as the product of the probability of photon absorption and the mean number of electrons generated per absorbed photon. We will assume that when a photon of energy $E$ is absorbed, its full energy is deposited, such that the absorbed energy $E_{\\mathrm{abs}}$ is equal to $E$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the indirect conversion detector, $R_{\\mathrm{ind}}(E)$. The signal generation process is a cascade of events:\n1.  An incident X-ray photon of energy $E$ is absorbed in the scintillator with a probability given by the absorption efficiency, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{abs,ind}}(E)$.\n2.  Upon absorption, the energy $E$ is converted into visible scintillation photons. The number of created light photons, $N_{\\mathrm{light}}$, is given by the light yield function $Y(E) = S E$, where $S$ is the light yield constant. Thus, $N_{\\mathrm{light}} = S E$.\n3.  These scintillation photons travel to the photodiode. The problem states to assume unity optical transport efficiency, so all $N_{\\mathrm{light}}$ photons are incident on the photodiode.\n4.  Each scintillation photon incident on the photodiode is converted into a collected electron with a probability equal to the quantum efficiency, $q$. The problem also specifies unity electronic collection efficiency.\nThe number of collected electrons per absorbed X-ray photon, which is the electronic gain of the indirect detector, is the product of the number of light photons and the quantum efficiency: $G_{\\mathrm{ind}} = N_{\\mathrm{light}} \\cdot q = (S E) q$.\nThe overall spectral response $R_{\\mathrm{ind}}(E)$ is the product of the absorption probability and this gain:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{ind}}(E) = \\eta_{\\mathrm{abs,ind}}(E) \\cdot G_{\\mathrm{ind}} = \\eta_{\\mathrm{abs,ind}}(E) S E q$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the direct conversion detector, $R_{\\mathrm{dir}}(E)$. The signal generation process is more direct:\n1.  An incident X-ray photon of energy $E$ is absorbed in the photoconductor with a probability given by the absorption efficiency, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{abs,dir}}(E)$.\n2.  Upon absorption, the energy $E$ is dissipated by creating electron-hole pairs. The mean number of created pairs is the deposited energy divided by the average energy required to create one pair, $w$. So, the number of electron-hole pairs is $N_{\\mathrm{pairs}} = E/w$.\n3.  These charge carriers are collected by an applied electric field. The problem states to assume unity charge collection efficiency, so each generated electron-hole pair contributes one collected electron to the signal.\nThe number of collected electrons per absorbed X-ray photon, the electronic gain of the direct detector, is therefore $G_{\\mathrm{dir}} = E/w$.\nThe overall spectral response $R_{\\mathrm{dir}}(E)$ is the product of the absorption probability and this gain:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{dir}}(E) = \\eta_{\\mathrm{abs,dir}}(E) \\cdot G_{\\mathrm{dir}} = \\eta_{\\mathrm{abs,dir}}(E) \\frac{E}{w}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate these responses at the reference energy $E_{0}=50~\\mathrm{keV}$ using the provided parameters:\n- $E_{0} = 50~\\mathrm{keV}$\n- $S = 52~\\mathrm{photons}/\\mathrm{keV}$\n- $q = 0.75$\n- $\\eta_{\\mathrm{abs,ind}}(E_{0}) = 0.80$\n- $\\eta_{\\mathrm{abs,dir}}(E_{0}) = 0.25$\n- $w = 45~\\mathrm{eV}$\n\nFor consistency in units, we must express all energies in the same unit. We will use kiloelectron-volts ($\\mathrm{keV}$). The pair-creation energy $w$ must be converted from $\\mathrm{eV}$ to $\\mathrm{keV}$.\nGiven $1~\\mathrm{keV} = 10^{3}~\\mathrm{eV}$, we have:\n$$w = 45~\\mathrm{eV} = 45 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{keV} = 0.045~\\mathrm{keV}$$\n\nWe can now calculate $R_{\\mathrm{ind}}(E_{0})$ and $R_{\\mathrm{dir}}(E_{0})$:\nFor the indirect detector:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{ind}}(E_{0}) = \\eta_{\\mathrm{abs,ind}}(E_{0}) S E_{0} q$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{ind}}(50~\\mathrm{keV}) = (0.80) \\cdot (52~\\mathrm{photons}/\\mathrm{keV}) \\cdot (50~\\mathrm{keV}) \\cdot (0.75)$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{ind}}(50~\\mathrm{keV}) = 0.80 \\cdot 52 \\cdot 50 \\cdot 0.75 = 1560$$\nSo, the expected number of electrons per incident $50~\\mathrm{keV}$ photon is $1560$.\n\nFor the direct detector:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{dir}}(E_{0}) = \\eta_{\\mathrm{abs,dir}}(E_{0}) \\frac{E_{0}}{w}$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{dir}}(50~\\mathrm{keV}) = (0.25) \\cdot \\frac{50~\\mathrm{keV}}{0.045~\\mathrm{keV}}$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{dir}}(50~\\mathrm{keV}) = 0.25 \\cdot \\frac{50}{0.045} = 0.25 \\cdot \\frac{50000}{45} = 0.25 \\cdot \\frac{10000}{9} = \\frac{2500}{9}$$\nSo, the expected number of electrons per incident $50~\\mathrm{keV}$ photon is $\\frac{2500}{9} \\approx 277.78$.\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $\\rho(E_{0}) = \\dfrac{R_{\\mathrm{ind}}(E_{0})}{R_{\\mathrm{dir}}(E_{0})}$:\n$$\\rho(E_{0}) = \\frac{1560}{\\frac{2500}{9}}$$\n$$\\rho(E_{0}) = \\frac{1560 \\cdot 9}{2500} = \\frac{14040}{2500} = \\frac{1404}{250} = 5.616$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
