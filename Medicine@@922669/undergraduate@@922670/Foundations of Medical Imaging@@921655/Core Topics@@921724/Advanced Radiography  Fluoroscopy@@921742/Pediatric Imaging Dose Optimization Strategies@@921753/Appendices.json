The problem is well-posed, as it provides all necessary information to calculate a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution will now be derived.\n\nThe exponential attenuation law, also known as the Beer-Lambert law, describes the transmission of a monoenergetic X-ray beam through a material. It is given by the equation:\n$$ \\Phi_{det} = \\Phi_{ent} \\exp(-\\mu x) $$\nwhere $\\Phi_{det}$ is the transmitted fluence reaching the detector, $\\Phi_{ent}$ is the entrance fluence incident on the patient, $\\mu$ is the linear attenuation coefficient of the material, and $x$ is the thickness of the material traversed by the beam.\n\nIn this problem, the path length $x$ is given by the patient's water-equivalent diameter, $d$. We can write separate equations for the adult and the child:\nFor the adult:\n$$ \\Phi_{det, adult} = \\Phi_{ent, adult} \\exp(-\\mu d_{adult}) $$\nFor the child:\n$$ \\Phi_{det, child} = \\Phi_{ent, child} \\exp(-\\mu d_{child}) $$\n\nThe core condition of the problem is that the detector fluence must be equal for both examinations:\n$$ \\Phi_{det, adult} = \\Phi_{det, child} $$\nSubstituting the attenuation law expressions into this equality yields:\n$$ \\Phi_{ent, adult} \\exp(-\\mu d_{adult}) = \\Phi_{ent, child} \\exp(-\\mu d_{child}) $$\n\nThe problem states that the entrance fluence is proportional to the $\\text{mAs}$. We can express this as $\\Phi_{ent} = C \\cdot \\text{mAs}$, where $C$ is a constant of proportionality that depends on the X-ray tube's output characteristics (kVp, filtration) and geometry, all of which are fixed. Thus, $C$ is the same for both exposures.\nSubstituting this relationship into our equation:\n$$ (C \\cdot \\text{mAs}_{\\text{adult}}) \\exp(-\\mu d_{adult}) = (C \\cdot \\text{mAs}_{\\text{child}}) \\exp(-\\mu d_{child}) $$\nThe non-zero constant $C$ cancels from both sides:\n$$ \\text{mAs}_{\\text{adult}} \\exp(-\\mu d_{adult}) = \\text{mAs}_{\\text{child}} \\exp(-\\mu d_{child}) $$\n\nWe are asked to find the multiplicative reduction factor, which we will denote as $R$, that relates the child's $\\text{mAs}$ to the adult's $\\text{mAs}$. This is defined by the equation:\n$$ \\text{mAs}_{\\text{child}} = R \\cdot \\text{mAs}_{\\text{adult}} $$\nThis factor $R$ is therefore the ratio:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\text{mAs}_{\\text{child}}}{\\text{mAs}_{\\text{adult}}} $$\nWe can solve for this ratio from our previous equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\text{mAs}_{\\text{child}}}{\\text{mAs}_{\\text{adult}}} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\mu d_{adult})}{\\exp(-\\mu d_{child})} $$\nUsing the property of exponents, $\\frac{\\exp(a)}{\\exp(b)} = \\exp(a-b)$, the expression for $R$ simplifies to:\n$$ R = \\exp(-\\mu d_{adult} - (-\\mu d_{child})) $$\n$$ R = \\exp(\\mu d_{child} - \\mu d_{adult}) $$\nFactoring out $\\mu$:\n$$ R = \\exp(\\mu (d_{child} - d_{adult})) $$\n\nNow we substitute the numerical values provided in the problem statement:\n- $\\mu = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n- $d_{adult} = 30\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- $d_{child} = 20\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n\n$$ R = \\exp(0.20 \\cdot (20 - 30)) $$\n$$ R = \\exp(0.20 \\cdot (-10)) $$\n$$ R = \\exp(-2.0) $$\n\nCalculating the numerical value of this expression:\n$$ R \\approx 0.13533528... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ R \\approx 0.135 $$\nThis factor represents the required reduction in $\\text{mAs}$ for the pediatric patient to achieve the same image receptor exposure as the adult, under the stated assumptions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.135}$$", "id": "4904818"}, {"introduction": "Effective dose optimization often involves complex trade-offs where interventions can have unintended consequences.

The concepts of primary radiation, scatter radiation, Automatic Exposure Control (AEC), gonadal shielding, and repeat analysis are standard in this field. The given numerical values are plausible for a pediatric pelvic radiograph scenario. For instance, an AEC-driven increase in exposure ($g = 1.30$) is a realistic consequence of placing an attenuating shield over the AEC detectors. A repeat rate of $10\\%$ ($p_r=0.10$) due to improper shield placement, while high, is not implausible and serves to model a real-world clinical trade-off. The dose components are consistent, as $D_{\\text{prim}} + D_{\\text{scat}} = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{mGy} + 0.40\\,\\mathrm{mGy} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{mGy} = D_b$. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to calculate a unique expected value for the ovarian dose under the new policy. The language is objective and free of ambiguity. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles and is structured as a solvable, quantitative problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A quantitative solution can be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe goal is to calculate the new expected mean ovarian dose per examination, $E[D_{\\text{shielded}}]$, and compare it to the baseline dose $D_b$. An \"examination\" under the shielding policy consists of an initial shielded exposure, and potentially a second unshielded exposure if a repeat is necessary.\n\nThe expected dose can be formulated as the sum of the dose from the initial (shielded) image and the expected additional dose from the possibility of a repeat.\n$$E[D_{\\text{shielded}}] = D_{\\text{shielded, single}} + p_r \\cdot D_{\\text{repeat}}$$\nwhere $D_{\\text{shielded, single}}$ is the dose from one shielded image and $D_{\\text{repeat}}$ is the dose from one repeat image.\n\n**1. Calculate the dose from a single shielded image ($D_{\\text{shielded, single}}$)**\n\nFirst, the presence of the shield causes the AEC to increase the $\\text{mAs}$ by a factor of $g=1.30$. Since dose is linear with $\\text{mAs}$, all incident radiation fields are increased by this factor.\n\nThe ovary is partially shielded. A fraction $f_c = 0.70$ is covered, and the remaining fraction $1 - f_c = 0.30$ is uncovered. The total dose is the area-weighted average of the dose to these two parts.\n\n- **Dose to the covered fraction:** The primary and scatter components are first increased by factor $g$ and then attenuated by their respective transmittances, $T_p$ and $T_s$.\n  $$D_{\\text{covered}} = g \\cdot (D_{\\text{prim}} \\cdot T_p + D_{\\text{scat}} \\cdot T_s)$$\n  $$D_{\\text{covered}} = 1.30 \\cdot (0.60\\,\\mathrm{mGy} \\cdot 0.05 + 0.40\\,\\mathrm{mGy} \\cdot 0.50)$$\n  $$D_{\\text{covered}} = 1.30 \\cdot (0.03\\,\\mathrm{mGy} + 0.20\\,\\mathrm{mGy}) = 1.30 \\cdot 0.23\\,\\mathrm{mGy} = 0.299\\,\\mathrm{mGy}$$\n\n- **Dose to the uncovered fraction:** The dose components are simply increased by the AEC factor $g$.\n  $$D_{\\text{uncovered}} = g \\cdot (D_{\\text{prim}} + D_{\\text{scat}}) = g \\cdot D_b$$\n  $$D_{\\text{uncovered}} = 1.30 \\cdot 1.0\\,\\mathrm{mGy} = 1.30\\,\\mathrm{mGy}$$\n\n- **Total dose for a single shielded image:**\n  $$D_{\\text{shielded, single}} = f_c \\cdot D_{\\text{covered}} + (1 - f_c) \\cdot D_{\\text{uncovered}}$$\n  $$D_{\\text{shielded, single}} = 0.70 \\cdot 0.299\\,\\mathrm{mGy} + 0.30 \\cdot 1.30\\,\\mathrm{mGy}$$\n  $$D_{\\text{shielded, single}} = 0.2093\\,\\mathrm{mGy} + 0.39\\,\\mathrm{mGy} = 0.5993\\,\\mathrm{mGy}$$\n\n**2. Calculate the expected dose penalty from repeats**\n\nA repeat is required with probability $p_r = 0.10$. The repeat image is unshielded and delivers the baseline dose $D_b = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{mGy}$. The expected dose contribution from repeats is:\n$$E[D_{\\text{repeat penalty}}] = p_r \\cdot D_b$$\n$$E[D_{\\text{repeat penalty}}] = 0.10 \\cdot 1.0\\,\\mathrm{mGy} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{mGy}$$\n\n**3. Calculate the total expected dose per examination**\n\nThe total expected dose is the sum of the dose from the initial shielded image and the expected dose penalty from repeats.\n$$E[D_{\\text{shielded}}] = D_{\\text{shielded, single}} + E[D_{\\text{repeat penalty}}]$$\n$$E[D_{\\text{shielded}}] = 0.5993\\,\\mathrm{mGy} + 0.10\\,\\mathrm{mGy} = 0.6993\\,\\mathrm{mGy}$$\n\nApproximating to two significant figures, consistent with the problem's options, the new expected dose is $0.70\\,\\mathrm{mGy}$.\n\n**4. Compare with the baseline dose**\n\nThe baseline dose was $D_b = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{mGy}$. The new expected dose with shielding is $E[D_{\\text{shielded}}] \\approx 0.70\\,\\mathrm{mGy}$.\nThe percent reduction is:\n$$\\text{Reduction} = \\frac{D_b - E[D_{\\text{shielded}}]}{D_b} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{1.0\\,\\mathrm{mGy} - 0.70\\,\\mathrm{mGy}}{1.0\\,\\mathrm{mGy}} \\times 100\\% = 30\\%$$\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The expected ovarian dose decreases from approximately $1.0\\,\\mathrm{mGy}$ to approximately $0.70\\,\\mathrm{mGy}$ (about a $30\\%$ reduction), even after accounting for the AEC increase and repeat-rate penalty.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with the calculated results. The new expected dose is $0.6993\\,\\mathrm{mGy}$ (approximately $0.70\\,\\mathrm{mGy}$), which is a decrease of approximately $30\\%$ from the baseline of $1.0\\,\\mathrm{mGy}$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The expected ovarian dose increases above $1.0\\,\\mathrm{mGy}$ because the AEC-driven $\\text{mAs}$ increase and repeats outweigh the shielding benefit.**\nThis is incorrect. The calculation shows that the new expected dose is approximately $0.70\\,\\mathrm{mGy}$, which is a decrease, not an increase. The shielding benefit, even with partial coverage, is substantial enough to overcome the penalties from AEC compensation and the repeat rate.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The net change is negligible (less than $5\\%$) because scatter dominates ovarian dose and shielding does not materially reduce scatter.**\nThis is incorrect for multiple reasons. The calculated net change is a reduction of approximately $30\\%$, which is not negligible. The premise that scatter dominates is false; the primary dose ($0.60\\,\\mathrm{mGy}$) is greater than the scatter dose ($0.40\\,\\mathrm{mGy}$). The premise that shielding does not materially reduce scatter is also false; with a transmittance of $T_s = 0.50$, it reduces scatter by $50\\%$, which is a material reduction.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Only if coverage exceeded $90\\%$ ($f_c > 0.90$) would shielding reduce ovarian dose; with $f_c = 0.70$, the net change is an increase when AEC and repeats are considered.**\nThis is incorrect. The calculation for $f_c = 0.70$ shows a net dose reduction, contradicting the second clause. To test the first clause, we can find the break-even coverage fraction $f_{c, \\text{break-even}}$ where the new expected dose equals the baseline dose:\n$$f_{c, \\text{break-even}} \\cdot (0.299) + (1 - f_{c, \\text{break-even}}) \\cdot (1.30) + 0.10 = 1.0$$\n$$0.299 f_{c, \\text{break-even}} + 1.30 - 1.30 f_{c, \\text{break-even}} = 0.90$$\n$$1.001 f_{c, \\text{break-even}} = 0.40$$\n$$f_{c, \\text{break-even}} \\approx 0.40$$\nThis means any coverage fraction greater than approximately $40\\%$ results in a net dose reduction.
