It is a well-posed, scientifically sound problem in the field of medical imaging physics. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of Input Signal-to-Noise Ratio ($\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{in}}$)\n\nThe input signal is the number of incident X-ray quanta, denoted by the random variable $N_{\\mathrm{in}}$. This is a Poisson process.\nThe mean number of quanta in a background pixel is $\\mathbb{E}[N_{\\mathrm{in, bg}}] = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{in}}$.\nThe mean number of quanta in the feature pixel is $\\mathbb{E}[N_{\\mathrm{in, feat}}] = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{in}}(1 + \\alpha)$.\nThe differential signal at the input is the change in the mean number of quanta:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathbb{E}[\\text{signal}_{\\mathrm{in}}] = \\mathbb{E}[N_{\\mathrm{in, feat}}] - \\mathbb{E}[N_{\\mathrm{in, bg}}] = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{in}}(1 + \\alpha) - \\lambda_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\alpha \\lambda_{\\mathrm{in}}\n$$\nThe noise at the input is the standard deviation of the number of quanta. For a Poisson process, the variance is equal to the mean. We evaluate the noise in the background region:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(N_{\\mathrm{in, bg}}) = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{in}}\n$$\nThe input Signal-to-Noise Ratio ($\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{in}}$) is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\mathbb{E}[\\text{signal}_{\\mathrm{in}}]}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(N_{\\mathrm{in, bg}})}} = \\frac{\\alpha \\lambda_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{in}}}} = \\alpha \\sqrt{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{in}}}\n$$\n\n### Derivation of Output Signal-to-Noise Ratio ($\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{out}}$)\n\nThe detection process is a binomial thinning of the incident Poisson process. The number of detected quanta, $N_d$, is also a Poisson random variable with mean $\\lambda_d = p \\lambda_{\\mathrm{in}}$ for the background.\nThe total output signal, $S$, is the sum of the signals from each of the $N_d$ detected quanta, plus the additive electronic noise $N_e$:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_d} X_i + N_e\n$$\nwhere $X_i$ are independent, identically distributed random variables representing the signal from each quantum, and $N_e$ is the electronic noise with $\\mathbb{E}[N_e]=0$ and $\\mathrm{Var}(N_e)=\\sigma_e^2$.\n\nFirst, we find the mean of the output signal. By the law of total expectation (Wald's identity):\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[S] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N_d} X_i + N_e\\right] = \\mathbb{E}[N_d] \\mathbb{E}[X] + \\mathbb{E}[N_e] = \\lambda_d \\mu + 0 = p \\lambda_{\\mathrm{in}} \\mu\n$$\nThe mean output signal for the background is $\\mathbb{E}[S_{\\mathrm{bg}}] = p \\lambda_{\\mathrm{in}} \\mu$.\nFor the feature, the mean incident quanta is $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{in}}(1+\\alpha)$, so the mean detected quanta is $p \\lambda_{\\mathrm{in}}(1+\\alpha)$.

The concepts of Poisson statistics, linear systems theory, Modulation Transfer Function (MTF), Noise Power Spectrum (NPS), and Detective Quantum Efficiency (DQE) are all fundamental to the field of medical imaging science.\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly based on the established linear systems model of imaging detectors. The assumptions (Poisson input, LSI system, additive white noise) are standard for a first-order analysis. The problem is scientifically realistic.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for a derivation of a standard formula and then to solve for one variable given all others. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n-   **Objective**: The language is precise and technical. All quantities are defined, and the task is a clear calculation.\n\nThe problem does not violate any fundamental principles. The setup is self-contained and consistent under the standard interpretation of these models in imaging physics. While a rigorous dimensional analysis of the provided quantities might suggest that some normalization factors are implicitly absorbed into their definitions, this is a common practice in the literature for simplifying expressions. The problem remains internally consistent and solvable as stated.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the DQE Expression\n\nThe Detective Quantum Efficiency (DQE) at a spatial frequency $f$ is defined as the ratio of the squared output signal-to-noise ratio ($SNR_{out}^2$) to the squared input signal-to-noise ratio ($SNR_{in}^2$).\n$$DQE(f) = \\frac{SNR_{out}^2(f)}{SNR_{in}^2(f)}$$\n\n**1. Input Signal-to-Noise Ratio ($SNR_{in}$)**\nThe input is described as a uniform field of mean quantum density $q$ with a superimposed small sinusoidal modulation. Let the input fluence be $\\phi(x,y) = q + \\Delta q \\cos(2\\pi f x)$, where $\\Delta q \\ll q$.\nThe \"signal\" is the modulation, with amplitude $\\Delta q$.\nThe noise arises from the Poisson nature of the quantum arrivals. For a Poisson process with mean rate $q$ (per unit area), the noise power spectrum (NPS) is white, with a constant value equal to the mean rate.\n$$S_{in}(f) = q$$\nThe input squared signal-to-noise ratio at frequency $f$ is proportional to the squared signal amplitude divided by the noise power spectrum at that frequency. The precise definition involves a filter bandwidth, but these factors cancel out in the DQE ratio.\n$$SNR_{in}^2(f) \\propto \\frac{(\\Delta q)^2}{S_{in}(f)} = \\frac{(\\Delta q)^2}{q}$$\n\n**2. Output Signal-to-Noise Ratio ($SNR_{out}$)**\nThe detector is a linear shift-invariant (LSI) system. The input signal modulation is processed by the detector's gain and spatial blurring.\n-   **Gain**: The scalar gain $g$ amplifies the signal by a factor of $g$.\n-   **Blurring**: The LSI blurring process is characterized by the MTF. For a sinusoidal input at frequency $f$, the amplitude is multiplied by $\\mathrm{MTF}(f)$.\nThe output signal modulation amplitude, $\\Delta D$, is therefore:\n$$\\Delta D(f) = \\Delta q \\cdot g \\cdot \\mathrm{MTF}(f)$$\nThe output noise has two uncorrelated components: the propagated quantum noise and the additive electronic noise. Their NPS values add.\n$$S_{out}(f) = S_{q,out}(f) + S_{e,out}(f)$$\nThe additive electronic noise NPS is given as a constant $S_{e,out}(f) = N_e$.\nThe quantum noise is the input quantum noise, $S_{in}(f) = q$, propagated through the LSI system. For an LSI system, an input NPS is transformed by multiplying it by the squared modulus of the system's transfer function. Here, the transfer function for the signal amplitude is $g \\cdot \\mathrm{MTF}(f)$.\n$$S_{q,out}(f) = S_{in}(f) \\cdot |g \\cdot \\mathrm{MTF}(f)|^2 = q \\cdot g^2 \\cdot \\mathrm{MTF}(f)^2$$\nThus, the total output noise power spectrum is:\n$$S_{out}(f) = q g^2 \\mathrm{MTF}(f)^2 + N_e$$\nThe output squared signal-to-noise ratio is proportional to the squared output signal amplitude divided by the output NPS.\n$$SNR_{out}^2(f) \\propto \\frac{(\\Delta D(f))^2}{S_{out}(f)} = \\frac{( \\Delta q \\cdot g \\cdot \\mathrm{MTF}(f) )^2}{q g^2 \\mathrm{MTF}(f)^2 + N_e}$$\n\n**3. Combining for DQE(f)**\nNow, we construct the DQE by taking the ratio of $SNR_{out}^2$ to $SNR_{in}^2$.\n$$DQE(f) = \\frac{\\frac{( \\Delta q \\cdot g \\cdot \\mathrm{MTF}(f) )^2}{q g^2 \\mathrm{MTF}(f)^2 + N_e}}{\\frac{(\\Delta q)^2}{q}}$$\nThe signal modulation term $(\\Delta q)^2$ cancels out.\n$$DQE(f) = \\frac{q \\cdot g^2 \\cdot \\mathrm{MTF}(f)^2}{q g^2 \\mathrm{MTF}(f)^2 + N_e}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the DQE at a single spatial frequency in the presence of additive white electronic noise.\n\n### Calculation of the Minimum Incident Quanta Density $q$\n\nWe are asked to find the value of $q$ for which $DQE(f_0) = 0.50$. Let $D = DQE(f_0)=0.50$ and $M = \\mathrm{MTF}(f_0)=0.40$. The expression becomes:\n$$D = \\frac{q g^2 M^2}{q g^2 M^2 + N_e}$$\nWe now solve this equation for $q$.\n$$D (q g^2 M^2 + N_e) = q g^2 M^2$$\n$$D q g^2 M^2 + D N_e = q g^2 M^2$$\n$$D N_e = q g^2 M^2 - D q g^2 M^2$$\n$$D N_e = q (g^2 M^2 (1 - D))$$\n$$q = \\frac{D N_e}{g^2 M^2 (1 - D)}$$\nNow, substitute the given numerical values:\n-   $D = 0.50$\n-   $M = 0.40$\n-   $g = 150$\n-   $N_e = 1.80 \\times 10^7$\n\n$$q = \\frac{0.50 \\times (1.80 \\times 10^7)}{150^2 \\times 0.40^2 \\times (1 - 0.50)}$$\n$$q = \\frac{0.50 \\times (1.80 \\times 10^7)}{150^2 \\times 0.40^2 \\times 0.50}$$\nThe factor of $0.50$ in the numerator and denominator cancels:\n$$q = \\frac{1.80 \\times 10^7}{150^2 \\times 0.40^2}$$\n$$q = \\frac{1.80 \\times 10^7}{22500 \\times 0.16}$$\n$$q = \\frac{1.80 \\times 10^7}{3600}$$\n$$q = \\frac{1.80 \\times 10^7}{3.6 \\times 10^3}$$\n$$q = (\\frac{1.80}{3.6}) \\times 10^{(7-3)} = 0.5 \\times 10^4 = 5000$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$q = 5.00 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{quanta}/\\mathrm{mm}^2$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.00 \\times 10^3}$$", "id": "4876004"}]}
