The relationship between the incident intensity, $I_0$, and the transmitted intensity, $I(t)$, after passing through a material of thickness $t$ is given by:\n$$I(t) = I_0 \\exp(-\\mu t)$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the linear attenuation coefficient of the material for the given photon energy.\n\nThe problem states that dose is proportional to the transmitted primary intensity. We can express this relationship as $D = kI$, where $D$ is the dose and $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\nTherefore, the incident dose, $D_{inc}$, is proportional to the incident intensity, $I_0$:\n$$D_{inc} = k I_0$$\nAnd the transmitted dose, $D_{trans}$, is proportional to the transmitted intensity, $I(t)$:\n$$D_{trans} = k I(t)$$\n\nThe fraction of the dose that is transmitted through the apron is the ratio of the transmitted dose to the incident dose:\n$$\\frac{D_{trans}}{D_{inc}} = \\frac{k I(t)}{k I_0} = \\frac{I(t)}{I_0}$$\nSubstituting the Beer–Lambert law, we find the transmission factor:\n$$\\frac{D_{trans}}{D_{inc}} = \\frac{I_0 \\exp(-\\mu t)}{I_0} = \\exp(-\\mu t)$$\n\nThe problem defines the dose reduction factor, which we will denote as $DRF$, as \"the fraction of incident dose removed by the apron\". The amount of dose removed is the difference between the incident dose and the transmitted dose: $D_{removed} = D_{inc} - D_{trans}$.\nThe fraction of incident dose removed is this amount divided by the incident dose:\n$$DRF = \\frac{D_{removed}}{D_{inc}} = \\frac{D_{inc} - D_{trans}}{D_{inc}}$$\n$$DRF = 1 - \\frac{D_{trans}}{D_{inc}}$$\nThis is the formal expression for the dose reduction factor based on the problem's definition.\n\nSubstituting our previously derived expression for the dose transmission fraction, we arrive at the first part of the answer: an expression for the dose reduction factor in terms of $\\mu$ and $t$.\n$$DRF = 1 - \\exp(-\\mu t)$$\n\nNow, we proceed to the second part of the task: computing the value of the $DRF$ for the given parameters.\nThe given values are:\n-   Linear attenuation coefficient: $\\mu = 59\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n-   Apron thickness: $t = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless product $\\mu t$:\n$$\\mu t = (59\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) \\times (0.05\\,\\mathrm{cm}) = 2.95$$\n\nNext, we substitute this value into the expression for the $DRF$:\n$$DRF = 1 - \\exp(-2.95)$$\n\nWe calculate the value of the exponential term:\n$$\\exp(-2.95) \\approx 0.05234070...$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the $DRF$:\n$$DRF = 1 - 0.05234070... = 0.94765929...$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$DRF \\approx 0.9477$$\nThis means that the lead apron removes approximately $94.77\\%$ of the incident dose from the primary beam.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9477}$$", "id": "4885825"}, {"introduction": "Radiation exposure is not administered without purpose; its goal is to produce an image of sufficient quality for diagnosis or intervention.

It is a well-posed, scientifically sound problem from the field of medical imaging physics. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to find the factor by which the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improves when the detector entrance exposure is increased from $E_1$ to $E_2$.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of X-ray quanta detected by the flat-panel detector per pulse. The problem states that the beam quality, source-to-image distance, and field of view are constant. Under these conditions, the detector entrance exposure, $E$, is directly proportional to the mean number of detected quanta, $\\bar{N}$. We can write this relationship as:\n$$ \\bar{N} = c \\cdot E $$\nwhere $c$ is a constant of proportionality that depends on the X-ray spectrum, detector area, and detector quantum efficiency, all of which are constant in this problem.\n\nAccording to assumption (i), $N$ follows Poisson statistics. A key property of the Poisson distribution is that its variance is equal to its mean. Therefore, the standard deviation of the number of detected quanta, $\\sigma_N$, is the square root of the mean:\n$$ \\sigma_N = \\sqrt{\\bar{N}} $$\n\nLet $S$ be the signal output from the detector. According to assumption (ii), the detector response is linear, so we can write:\n$$ S = g \\cdot N $$\nwhere $g$ is the detector gain, a constant that converts the number of detected quanta into a signal value (e.g., an analog-to-digital unit, or ADU).\n\nThe mean signal, $\\bar{S}$, is the \"Signal\" component of the SNR. It is given by:\n$$ \\bar{S} = E[S] = E[gN] = gE[N] = g\\bar{N} $$\nwhere $E[...]$ denotes the expectation operator.\n\nAccording to assumption (iii), the system is quantum-limited. This means the total noise is dominated by the quantum noise, which arises from the statistical fluctuations in $N$. The \"Noise\" component of the SNR is the standard deviation of the signal, $\\sigma_S$:\n$$ \\sigma_S^2 = \\text{Var}(S) = \\text{Var}(gN) = g^2 \\text{Var}(N) = g^2 \\sigma_N^2 $$\n$$ \\sigma_S = \\sqrt{g^2 \\sigma_N^2} = g \\sigma_N $$\nwhere $\\text{Var}(...)$ denotes the variance operator.\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the SNR using its definition:\n$$ \\text{SNR} = \\frac{\\text{mean signal}}{\\text{standard deviation of noise}} = \\frac{\\bar{S}}{\\sigma_S} $$\nSubstituting our expressions for $\\bar{S}$ and $\\sigma_S$:\n$$ \\text{SNR} = \\frac{g\\bar{N}}{g\\sigma_N} = \\frac{\\bar{N}}{\\sigma_N} $$\nUsing the Poisson statistics property $\\sigma_N = \\sqrt{\\bar{N}}$:\n$$ \\text{SNR} = \\frac{\\bar{N}}{\\sqrt{\\bar{N}}} = \\sqrt{\\bar{N}} $$\nThis fundamental result shows that for a quantum-limited imaging system, the SNR is equal to the square root of the mean number of detected quanta.\n\nTo find how SNR relates to exposure $E$, we substitute $\\bar{N} = cE$:\n$$ \\text{SNR} = \\sqrt{cE} $$\nThis shows that the SNR is proportional to the square root of the detector entrance exposure: $\\text{SNR} \\propto \\sqrt{E}$.\n\nWe can now calculate the improvement factor by taking the ratio of the SNR at exposure $E_2$ to the SNR at exposure $E_1$.
