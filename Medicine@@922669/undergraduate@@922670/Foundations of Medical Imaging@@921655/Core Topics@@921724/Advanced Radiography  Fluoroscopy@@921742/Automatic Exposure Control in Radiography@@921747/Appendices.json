This practice delves into the key performance metric used in digital radiography: the Deviation Index ($DI$). Starting from basic axiomatic requirements, you will derive the logarithmic formula for $DI$, demystifying how it relates the actual Exposure Index ($EI$) to the target ($EIT$) and learning to interpret its value in terms of relative receptor dose [@problem_id:4864907].", "problem": "A digital radiography system equipped with Automatic Exposure Control (AEC) uses an Exposure Index (EI) to represent the detector’s incident air kerma, with the proportional relationship $EI = \\alpha K_{\\text{ind}}$ for some constant $\\alpha > 0$. For a given examination, the Target Exposure Index (EIT) is specified, and the Deviation Index (DI) is intended to quantify how far the achieved exposure is from the target. Assume the following design requirements grounded in standard engineering practice for logarithmic metrics of power-like quantities in imaging systems:\n\n- The Deviation Index $DI$ depends only on the ratio $x = EI/EIT$, is dimensionless, and satisfies $DI = 0$ when $x = 1$.\n- A multiplicative change in $x$ should map to an additive change in $DI$, that is, for any positive $x$ and $y$, the change $DI(xy) - DI(y)$ depends only on $x$.\n- A tenfold change in exposure ratio should correspond to a $+10$ or $-10$ change in $DI$, i.e., $DI(10) = +10$ and $DI(0.1) = -10$.\n\nStarting from these requirements and standard properties of logarithms, derive a closed-form expression for $DI$ as a function of $EI$ and $EIT$. Then, under AEC operation, suppose an exam yields $DI = -1$. Using your derived expression, compute the receptor air kerma ratio $r = EI/EIT$ corresponding to this $DI$.

The problem states three fundamental requirements for this function:\n1. $DI(1) = 0$.\n2. For any positive $x$ and $y$, $DI(xy) - DI(y)$ is a function of $x$ only. Let this be $g(x)$, so $DI(xy) - DI(y) = g(x)$.\n3. $DI(10) = 10$.\n\nFrom the second requirement, we can establish the functional form of $DI(x)$. Let $y=1$. Then $DI(x \\cdot 1) - DI(1) = g(x)$. Using the first requirement, $DI(1)=0$, this simplifies to $DI(x) = g(x)$.\nSubstituting $g(x) = DI(x)$ back into the original relation gives:\n$DI(xy) - DI(y) = DI(x)$\nwhich can be rearranged to:\n$DI(xy) = DI(x) + DI(y)$\nThis is the fundamental identity that defines logarithmic functions. Therefore, $DI(x)$ must be of the form $DI(x) = C \\log_b(x)$ for some constant $C$ and some base $b$. For convenience, and based on the third requirement involving a factor of $10$, we choose the base $b=10$.\nSo, we can write the function as:\n$DI(x) = C \\log_{10}(x)$\n\nNow, we use the third requirement, $DI(10) = 10$, to determine the constant $C$.\n$10 = C \\log_{10}(10)$\nSince $\\log_{10}(10) = 1$, we get:\n$10 = C \\cdot 1 \\implies C = 10$\n\nThus, the closed-form expression for the Deviation Index is:\n$DI(x) = 10 \\log_{10}(x)$\nSubstituting $x = EI/EIT$, we have:\n$DI = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{EI}{EIT}\\right)$\n\nThe problem asks for the value of the ratio $r = EI/EIT$ when the measured Deviation Index is $DI = -1$.\nUsing the derived formula:\n$-1 = 10 \\log_{10}(r)$\n\nTo solve for $r$, we first isolate the logarithm term by dividing by $10$:\n$\\log_{10}(r) = \\frac{-1}{10} = -0.1$\n\nNext, we solve for $r$ by taking the antilogarithm (i.e., raising $10$ to the power of both sides):\n$r = 10^{-0.1}$\n\nComputing the value of $10^{-0.1}$ and rounding to four significant figures:\n$r \\approx 0.7943282347...$\n$r \\approx 0.7943$\n\nA $DI$ value of $-1$ indicates an underexposure.

For a fixed kilovoltage peak and filtration, assume the detector signal at chamber $i$ is proportional to the tube current-time product (milliampere-second, mAs) multiplied by an effective transmission factor $T_i$, so that $S_i = C \\, m \\, T_i$, where $S_i$ is the chamber signal, $m$ is the mAs, $T_i \\in (0,1)$ models patient and object attenuation over chamber $i$, and $C>0$ is a system constant. The AEC target setpoint is a fixed value $S_{\\text{target}}$; the system terminates the exposure when a specified statistic of $\\{S_i\\}_{i=1}^{3}$ reaches $S_{\\text{target}}$.

Without any implant over any chamber, all three effective transmissions are equal to a common value $T_0 \\in (0,1)$, and both rules produce the same mAs $m_{\\text{opt}} = S_{\\text{target}}/(C T_0)$, which is considered optimal for the non-implant regions. A metallic implant, when it overlies a chamber, reduces that chamber’s effective transmission by a factor $a \\in (0,1)$ so that $T_i$ becomes $a T_0$ at that chamber; otherwise $T_i = T_0$. For each chamber, the event that an implant overlies it occurs independently with probability $q \\in (0,1)$.\n\nDefine the exposure factor for non-implant regions under a termination rule as $F \\equiv m/m_{\\text{opt}}$, where $m$ is the mAs delivered by that rule for the realized $\\{T_i\\}$.

The signal from chamber $i$ is given by $S_i = C \\, m \\, T_i$, where $m$ is the mAs, $C$ is a constant, and $T_i$ is the transmission factor. The clinically optimal mAs, $m_{\\text{opt}}$, is achieved under non-implant conditions, where $T_i = T_0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. The definition of $m_{\\text{opt}}$ is given as $m_{\\text{opt}} = S_{\\text{target}}/(C T_0)$, which implies the target signal can be expressed as $S_{\\text{target}} = C m_{\\text{opt}} T_0$. The exposure factor is defined as $F \\equiv m/m_{\\text{opt}}$.\n\nLet $n_i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$ be the number of chambers overlain by a metallic implant. For a chamber $i$ with an implant, its transmission is $T_i = a T_0$. For a chamber without an implant, $T_i = T_0$. The signals are thus $S_i = C m a T_0$ for the $n_i$ chambers with implants and $S_i = C m T_0$ for the $3-n_i$ chambers without implants.

The maximum signal will come from a chamber with transmission $T_0$, so $\\max\\{S_i\\} = C m_{\\text{max}} T_0$. The termination condition is $C m_{\\text{max}} T_0 = S_{\\text{target}}$. Substituting $S_{\\text{target}} = C m_{\\text{opt}} T_0$, we get $C m_{\\text{max}} T_0 = C m_{\\text{opt}} T_0$, which gives $m_{\\text{max}} = m_{\\text{opt}}$. The exposure factor is $F_{\\text{max}}(n_i) = m_{\\text{max}}/m_{\\text{opt}} = 1$.\n- If $n_i = 3$, all three chambers are overlain by implants. All transmissions are $a T_0$, so all signals are equal: $S_i = C m_{\\text{max}} a T_0$. The termination condition is $C m_{\\text{max}} a T_0 = S_{\\text{target}}$. Substituting for $S_{\\text{target}}$, we get $C m_{\\text{max}} a T_0 = C m_{\\text{opt}} T_0$, which simplifies to $m_{\\text{max}} = m_{\\text{opt}}/a$. The exposure factor is $F_{\\text{max}}(3) = m_{\\text{max}}/m_{\\text{opt}} = 1/a$.\n\nIn summary, for the maximum rule:\n$$ F_{\\text{max}}(n_i) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{for } n_i \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\} \\\\ 1/a & \\text{for } n_i = 3 \\end{cases} $$\n\nAverage Rule: Termination occurs when $\\frac{S_1+S_2+S_3}{3} = S_{\\text{target}}$.\nLet $m_{\\text{avg}}$ be the mAs delivered under this rule.

The probability of this event is the overexposure rate:\n$$ R_{\\text{over, max}} = P(n_i=3) = 0.008 $$\n\nOverexposure for the Average Rule ($R_{\\text{over, avg}}$):\nWe check when $F_{\\text{avg}}(n_i) > 1.2$. With $a=0.1$, $1-a=0.9$. The exposure factor is $F_{\\text{avg}}(n_i) = \\frac{3}{3 - 0.9 n_i}$.\n- For $n_i = 0$, $F_{\\text{avg}}(0) = \\frac{3}{3} = 1$. Not an overexposure.\n- For $n_i = 1$, $F_{\\text{avg}}(1) = \\frac{3}{3 - 0.9} = \\frac{3}{2.1} \\approx 1.4286$. Since $1.4286 > 1.2$, this is an overexposure.\n- For $n_i = 2$, $F_{\\text{avg}}(2) = \\frac{3}{3 - 1.8} = \\frac{3}{1.2} = 2.5$. Since $2.5 > 1.2$, this is an overexposure.\n- For $n_i = 3$, $F_{\\text{avg}}(3) = \\frac{3}{3 - 2.7} = \\frac{3}{0.3} = 10$. Since $10 > 1.2$, this is an overexposure.\nOverexposure for the average rule occurs for $n_i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.
