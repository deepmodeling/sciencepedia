It is based on the standard, internationally accepted methodology for CT dosimetry as defined by bodies such as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The provided quantities are physically realistic for a clinical CT examination of the abdomen. The problem asks for the derivation and calculation of a standard dose metric, the Volume CTDI ($\\text{CTDI}_{vol}$), from fundamental measurements. All necessary data are provided, and there are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. The problem is a formalizable and non-trivial application of the principles of medical imaging physics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the appropriate dose metric that represents the average dose to the scanned volume during a helical acquisition and the computation of its value. This metric is the Volume Computed Tomography Dose Index, denoted as $\\text{CTDI}_{vol}$. The derivation proceeds from the provided axial scan measurements.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the weighted Computed Tomography Dose Index, $\\text{CTDI}_{w}$. This metric provides a weighted average of the dose delivered across the scan field of view (the x-y plane) in a single axial scan. It is calculated from the dose measured at the center of the dosimetry phantom, $\\text{CTDI}_{100,c}$, and the average dose measured at four peripheral positions, $\\text{CTDI}_{100,p}$.\n\nThe average peripheral dose, $\\text{CTDI}_{100,p}$, is calculated from the four given measurements: $C_{p1} = 32.0\\,\\text{mGy}$, $C_{p2} = 34.0\\,\\text{mGy}$, $C_{p3} = 33.0\\,\\text{mGy}$, and $C_{p4} = 35.0\\,\\text{mGy}$.\n$$ \\text{CTDI}_{100,p} = \\frac{C_{p1} + C_{p2} + C_{p3} + C_{p4}}{4} $$\n$$ \\text{CTDI}_{100,p} = \\frac{32.0\\,\\text{mGy} + 34.0\\,\\text{mGy} + 33.0\\,\\text{mGy} + 35.0\\,\\text{mGy}}{4} = \\frac{134.0\\,\\text{mGy}}{4} = 33.5\\,\\text{mGy} $$\n\nThe weighted CTDI, $\\text{CTDI}_w$, for a standard body phantom is defined by the following relation, which weights the peripheral dose more heavily to account for the larger area it represents compared to the center:\n$$ \\text{CTDI}_w = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{CTDI}_{100,c} + \\frac{2}{3} \\text{CTDI}_{100,p} $$\nSubstituting the given central value $\\text{CTDI}_{100,c} = 18.0\\,\\text{mGy}$ and the calculated average peripheral value $\\text{CTDI}_{100,p} = 33.5\\,\\text{mGy}$:\n$$ \\text{CTDI}_w = \\frac{1}{3} (18.0\\,\\text{mGy}) + \\frac{2}{3} (33.5\\,\\text{mGy}) $$\n$$ \\text{CTDI}_w = 6.0\\,\\text{mGy} + \\frac{67.0}{3}\\,\\text{mGy} = 6.0\\,\\text{mGy} + 22.333...\\,\\text{mGy} = 28.333...\\,\\text{mGy} $$\nTo maintain precision, we can express $\\text{CTDI}_w$ as a fraction:\n$$ \\text{CTDI}_w = \\frac{18.0}{3}\\,\\text{mGy} + \\frac{67.0}{3}\\,\\text{mGy} = \\frac{85.0}{3}\\,\\text{mGy} $$\n\nNext, we must account for the helical nature of the scan. The $\\text{CTDI}_w$ represents the average dose for a single axial rotation. In a helical scan, the patient table moves continuously, which either spreads the radiation dose over a larger volume (for pitch $ 1$) or concentrates it via overlapping acquisitions (for pitch $ 1$). This effect is quantified by the helical pitch, $p$.\n\nThe helical pitch is defined as the table travel per gantry rotation divided by the total nominal x-ray beam width.\nFirst, we determine the table travel per rotation, $d$. This is the product of the table speed, $v$, and the gantry rotation time, $T$.\n$$ d = v \\times T $$\nGiven $v = 100.0\\,\\text{mm}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$ and $T = 0.500\\,\\text{s}$:\n$$ d = (100.0\\,\\text{mm}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (0.500\\,\\text{s}) = 50.0\\,\\text{mm} $$\n\nSecond, we determine the total nominal beam width, $W$. This is the product of the number of active detector rows, $N$, and the thickness of each row, $t$.\n$$ W = N \\times t $$\nGiven $N=64$ and $t=0.625\\,\\text{mm}$:\n$$ W = 64 \\times 0.625\\,\\text{mm} = 40.0\\,\\text{mm} $$\n\nNow, the helical pitch, $p$, is calculated as:\n$$ p = \\frac{d}{W} = \\frac{vT}{Nt} $$\n$$ p = \\frac{50.0\\,\\text{mm}}{40.0\\,\\text{mm}} = 1.25 $$\nThe pitch is a dimensionless quantity.\n\nFinally, the Volume CTDI, $\\text{CTDI}_{vol}$, is derived. It represents the average dose over the entire scanned volume and is obtained by dividing the weighted CTDI by the helical pitch. This relationship shows how the axial measurements, which yield $\\text{CTDI}_w$, are corrected by the scan kinematics (pitch) to determine the average dose in a helical scan.\n$$ \\text{CTDI}_{vol} = \\frac{\\text{CTDI}_w}{p} $$\nSubstituting the values we calculated for $\\text{CTDI}_w$ and $p$:\n$$ \\text{CTDI}_{vol} = \\frac{\\frac{85.0}{3}\\,\\text{mGy}}{1.25} = \\frac{\\frac{85.0}{3}}{\\frac{5}{4}}\\,\\text{mGy} = \\frac{85.0}{3} \\times \\frac{4}{5}\\,\\text{mGy} $$\n$$ \\text{CTDI}_{vol} = \\frac{340.0}{15}\\,\\text{mGy} = \\frac{68.0}{3}\\,\\text{mGy} \\approx 22.666...\\,\\text{mGy} $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\text{CTDI}_{vol} \\approx 22.67\\,\\text{mGy} $$\nThis value, $\\text{CTDI}_{vol}$, is the appropriate dose metric that represents the average dose to the scanned volume during the specified helical acquisition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{22.67}$$", "id": "4872817"}, {"introduction": "While $CTDI_{vol}$ describes the average dose intensity, the Dose-Length Product (DLP) quantifies the total radiation delivered over the entire scan length.
