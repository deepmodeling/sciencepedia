It is a symmetric trapezoid centered at $z=0$. The base width is $W_b = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and the top plateau width is $W_p = 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Let the maximum amplitude of the SSP be $h$.

The problem states that the SSP is normalized to unit area:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} SSP(z) \\, dz = 1\n$$\nUsing the formula for the area of a trapezoid:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}(W_b + W_p)h = 1\n$$\nSubstituting the given values, $W_b = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $W_p = 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}(5\\,\\mathrm{mm} + 1\\,\\mathrm{mm})h = 1\n$$\n$$\n(3\\,\\mathrm{mm})h = 1 \\implies h = \\frac{1}{3}\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-1}\n$$\nThe trapezoid is defined by its vertices. Since it is centered at $z=0$, the coordinates are:\n- Plateau: from $z = -W_p/2 = -0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ to $z = +W_p/2 = +0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Base: from $z = -W_b/2 = -2.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ to $z = +W_b/2 = +2.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nThe function $SSP(z)$ is piecewise linear.\n- For $|z| \\le 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $SSP(z) = h = \\frac{1}{3}\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-1}$.\n- For $0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm} < |z| \\le 2.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, the SSP decreases linearly from $h$ to $0$. Let's define the ramp for $z > 0$. The line passes through $(0.5, 1/3)$ and $(2.5, 0)$. The slope is $m = \\frac{0 - 1/3}{2.5 - 0.5} = \\frac{-1/3}{2} = -\\frac{1}{6}$.

Its surface is described by the equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2$. The in-plane radial coordinate is $\\rho = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For a given $\\rho \\le r$, the sphere extends in the $z$-direction from $z_{-} = -\\sqrt{r^2 - \\rho^2}$ to $z_{+} = +\\sqrt{r^2 - \\rho^2}$. The local thickness of the sphere along the $z$-axis at an in-plane radius $\\rho$ is therefore:\n    $$t(\\rho) = z_{+} - z_{-} = 2\\sqrt{r^2 - \\rho^2}$$\n    For $\\rho > r$, the thickness $t(\\rho) = 0$.\n\n2.  **Segmentation Criterion**\n    The problem states that the slice is centered on the sphere. The slice sensitivity profile (SSP) is a rectangular function of width $W$. The measured voxel value is proportional to the fraction of the SSP occupied by the lesion, which for a rectangular profile is given by the local thickness divided by the SSP width: $t(\\rho) / W$. Let the intrinsic attenuation of the lesion material be $A_{\\text{true}}$. The measured attenuation at in-plane radius $\\rho$, $A_{\\text{meas}}(\\rho)$, is given by:\n    $$A_{\\text{meas}}(\\rho) = A_{\\text{true}} \\frac{t(\\rho)}{W}$$\n    A voxel is included in the segmented volume if its measured attenuation is at or above a fraction $f$ of the intrinsic attenuation. The condition for segmentation is:\n    $$A_{\\text{meas}}(\\rho) \\ge f A_{\\text{true}}$$\n    Substituting the expression for $A_{\\text{meas}}(\\rho)$:\n    $$A_{\\text{true}} \\frac{t(\\rho)}{W} \\ge f A_{\\text{true}}$$\n    Assuming $A_{\\text{true}} > 0$, we can simplify this to a condition on the local thickness:\n    $$t(\\rho) \\ge f W$$\n\n3.  **Segmented Area**\n    We now find the range of in-plane radii $\\rho$ that satisfy the segmentation criterion.

The problem specifies that the scanner is calibrated and displays CT numbers relative to water at the calibration energy, $E_{\\text{cal}} = 60\\,\\mathrm{keV}$. Therefore, the reference values are $\\mu_{\\text{water}}(E_{\\text{cal}})$. The formula we will use is:\n$$ HU_m(E_{\\text{eff}}) = 1000 \\times \\frac{\\mu_m(E_{\\text{eff}}) - \\mu_{\\text{water}}(E_{\\text{cal}})}{\\mu_{\\text{water}}(E_{\\text{cal}})} $$\nwhere $E_{\\text{eff}}$ is the effective energy governing the attenuation of material $m$.\n\nThe linear attenuation coefficient $\\mu$ is related to the mass attenuation coefficient $(\\mu/\\rho)$ and the material's physical density $\\rho$ by the equation:\n$$ \\mu = \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}\\right) \\times \\rho $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the necessary linear attenuation coefficients using the provided data.\n\n1.  **Linear attenuation coefficients at the calibration energy, $E_{\\text{cal}} = 60\\,\\mathrm{keV}$**:\n    -   Water: $\\mu_{\\text{water}}(E_{\\text{cal}}) = (\\mu/\\rho)_{\\text{water}}(E_{\\text{cal}}) \\times \\rho_{\\text{water}} = 0.206\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/g} \\times 1.00\\,\\mathrm{g/cm^3} = 0.206\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\n    -   Adipose tissue: $\\mu_{\\text{adipose}}(E_{\\text{cal}}) = (\\mu/\\rho)_{\\text{adipose}}(E_{\\text{cal}}) \\times \\rho_{\\text{adipose}} = 0.195\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/g} \\times 0.92\\,\\mathrm{g/cm^3} = 0.1794\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\n    -   Cortical bone: $\\mu_{\\text{bone}}(E_{\\text{cal}}) = (\\mu/\\rho)_{\\text{bone}}(E_{\\text{cal}}) \\times \\rho_{\\text{bone}} = 0.408\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/g} \\times 1.85\\,\\mathrm{g/cm^3} = 0.7548\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\n\n2.  **Linear attenuation coefficient for bone at the beam-hardened energy, $E_{\\text{bh}} = 70\\,\\mathrm{keV}$**:\n    -   Cortical bone: $\\mu_{\\text{bone}}(E_{\\text{bh}}) = (\\mu/\\rho)_{\\text{bone}}(E_{\\text{bh}}) \\times \\rho_{\\text{bone}} = 0.351\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/g} \\times 1.85\\,\\mathrm{g/cm^3} = 0.64935\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\n\nNow we can compute the quantities requested in the problem.\n\n**Part 1: Compute the Hounsfield Units for adipose and bone at $E_{\\text{cal}}$.**\n\nFor a homogeneous voxel of adipose tissue imaged under ideal calibration conditions, the effective energy is $E_{\\text{cal}}$.\n$$ HU_{\\text{adipose}}(E_{\\text{cal}}) = 1000 \\times \\frac{\\mu_{\\text{adipose}}(E_{\\text{cal}}) - \\mu_{\\text{water}}(E_{\\text{cal}})}{\\mu_{\\text{water}}(E_{\\text{cal}})} $$\n$$ HU_{\\text{adipose}}(E_{\\text{cal}}) = 1000 \\times \\frac{0.1794 - 0.206}{0.206} = 1000 \\times \\frac{-0.0266}{0.206} \\approx -129.126\\,\\mathrm{HU} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $HU_{\\text{adipose}}(E_{\\text{cal}}) = -129.1\\,\\mathrm{HU}$.\n\nFor a homogeneous voxel of cortical bone imaged under ideal calibration conditions, the effective energy is $E_{\\text{cal}}$.\n$$ HU_{\\text{bone}}(E_{\\text{cal}}) = 1000 \\times \\frac{\\mu_{\\text{bone}}(E_{\\text{cal}}) - \\mu_{\\text{water}}(E_{\\text{cal}})}{\\mu_{\\text{water}}(E_{\\text{cal}})} $$\n$$ HU_{\\text{bone}}(E_{\\text{cal}}) = 1000 \\times \\frac{0.7548 - 0.206}{0.206} = 1000 \\times \\frac{0.5488}{0.206} \\approx 2664.078\\,\\mathrm{HU} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $HU_{\\text{bone}}(E_{\\text{cal}}) = 2664\\,\\mathrm{HU}$.\n\n**Part 2: Determine the apparent bone volume fraction $f$.**\n\nA pure cortical bone voxel is imaged under beam-hardening conditions, so its true attenuation is governed by the effective energy $E_{\\text{bh}}$. The scanner, however, is calibrated to water at $E_{\\text{cal}}$ and computes the HU value based on this calibration. The measured CT number for this beam-hardened bone voxel, let's call it $HU_{\\text{measured}}$, is therefore:\n$$ HU_{\\text{measured}} = 1000 \\times \\frac{\\mu_{\\text{bone}}(E_{\\text{bh}}) - \\mu_{\\text{water}}(E_{\\text{cal}})}{\\mu_{\\text{water}}(E_{\\text{cal}})} $$\n$$ HU_{\\text{measured}} = 1000 \\times \\frac{0.64935 - 0.206}{0.206} = 1000 \\times \\frac{0.44335}{0.206} \\approx 2152.184\\,\\mathrm{HU} $$\nThis value is lower than the true HU of bone at the calibration energy ($2664\\,\\mathrm{HU}$), which is a characteristic effect of beam hardening on high-attenuation materials (cupping artifact).\n\nThis measured HU value is then misinterpreted as a partial-volume mixture of bone and water, both at the calibration energy $E_{\\text{cal}}$. The model for the mixture is given as:\n$$ HU_{\\text{mix}} = f \\cdot HU_{\\text{bone}}(E_{\\text{cal}}) + (1-f) \\cdot HU_{\\text{water}}(E_{\\text{cal}}) $$\nWe set $HU_{\\text{mix}} = HU_{\\text{measured}}$. By definition, the HU of the reference material (water at $E_{\\text{cal}}$) is zero:\n$$ HU_{\\text{water}}(E_{\\text{cal}}) = 1000 \\times \\frac{\\mu_{\\text{water}}(E_{\\text{cal}}) - \\mu_{\\text{water}}(E_{\\text{cal}})}{\\mu_{\\text{water}}(E_{\\text{cal}})} = 0 $$\nThe mixture equation simplifies to:\n$$ HU_{\\text{measured}} = f \\cdot HU_{\\text{bone}}(E_{\\text{cal}}) $$\nWe can now solve for the apparent bone volume fraction, $f$:\n$$ f = \\frac{HU_{\\text{measured}}}{HU_{\\text{bone}}(E_{\\text{cal}})} $$\nUsing the unrounded values for higher precision in the calculation:\n$$ f = \\frac{2152.184...}{2664.078...} \\approx 0.807853 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the apparent bone volume fraction is $f = 0.8079$.\n\nThe three required results, rounded to four significant figures, are:\n1. $HU_{\\text{adipose}}(E_{\\text{cal}}) = -129.1$\n2. $HU_{\\text{bone}}(E_{\\text{cal}}) = 2664$\n3. $f = 0.8079$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-129.1 & 2664 & 0.8079\n\\end{pmatrix}\n} $$", "id": "4904451"}]}
