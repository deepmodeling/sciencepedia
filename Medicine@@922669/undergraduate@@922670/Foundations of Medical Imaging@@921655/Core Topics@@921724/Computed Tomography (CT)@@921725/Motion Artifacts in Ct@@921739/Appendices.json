Angles must be considered in radians.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of the Radon transform and rigid body motion, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe two-dimensional ($2$-D) Radon transform models the data acquisition process in parallel-beam Computed Tomography (CT). The sinogram, denoted by $p(s, \\theta)$, is the set of line integrals of the object's attenuation function, $f(x, y)$. A line is parameterized by its signed perpendicular distance from the origin, $s$, and the angle $\\theta$ its normal vector makes with the positive $x$-axis. The definition of the Radon transform is:\n$$p(s, \\theta) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x, y) \\delta(x \\cos\\theta + y \\sin\\theta - s) \\, dx \\, dy$$\nwhere $\\delta(\\cdot)$ is the Dirac delta function.\n\nThe problem states that the object undergoes a rigid anterior translation. The anterior direction is defined as the positive $y$-axis. The translation vector is therefore $\\mathbf{d}(t) = (0, d_y(t))$. The magnitude of this translation, $d_y(t)$, increases linearly with time $t$ from $0$ mm at $t=0$ to $5$ mm at $t=0.2$ s. We can model this linear relationship as $d_y(t) = kt$ for some constant $k$. Using the given conditions:\n$d_y(0.2) = k(0.2 \\text{ s}) = 5 \\text{ mm}$.\nSolving for $k$, we find the rate of translation:\n$$k = \\frac{5 \\text{ mm}}{0.2 \\text{ s}} = 25 \\text{ mm/s}$$\nThus, the displacement of the object along the $y$-axis at any time $t$ in the interval $0 \\leq t \\leq 0.2$ s is given by:\n$$d_y(t) = 25t$$\nwhere $t$ is in seconds and $d_y(t)$ is in millimeters.\n\nA rigid translation of the object by a vector $\\mathbf{d}(t) = (d_x(t), d_y(t))$ transforms the object's attenuation function from $f(x, y)$ to a time-dependent function $f_t(x, y) = f(x - d_x(t), y - d_y(t))$. For the given motion, this becomes:\n$$f_t(x, y) = f(x, y - d_y(t))$$\nThe sinogram measured at time $t$, denoted $p_t(s, \\theta)$, is the Radon transform of this translated function:\n$$p_t(s, \\theta) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x, y - d_y(t)) \\delta(x \\cos\\theta + y \\sin\\theta - s) \\, dx \\, dy$$\nTo relate this to the original sinogram $p(s, \\theta)$, we perform a change of variables in the integral: let $x' = x$ and $y' = y - d_y(t)$. This implies $y = y' + d_y(t)$, and the Jacobian of this transformation is $1$. Substituting these into the integral gives:\n$$p_t(s, \\theta) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x', y') \\delta(x' \\cos\\theta + (y' + d_y(t)) \\sin\\theta - s) \\, dx' \\, dy'$$\nWe can rearrange the argument of the Dirac delta function:\n$$\\delta(x' \\cos\\theta + y' \\sin\\theta + d_y(t)\\sin\\theta - s) = \\delta(x' \\cos\\theta + y' \\sin\\theta - (s - d_y(t)\\sin\\theta))$$\nThe integral now takes the form of the original Radon transform of $f(x', y')$, but evaluated at a shifted $s$ coordinate, $s' = s - d_y(t)\\sin\\theta$.\n$$p_t(s, \\theta) = p(s - d_y(t)\\sin\\theta, \\theta)$$\nThis result demonstrates the shift property of the Radon transform: a translation of the object by a vector $(d_x, d_y)$ causes a shift, $\\Delta s$, in the sinogram's $s$-coordinate given by $\\Delta s = d_x \\cos\\theta + d_y \\sin\\theta$. For our problem, $d_x=0$ and $d_y=d_y(t)$, so the sinogram displacement at a given time $t$ and angle $\\theta$ is:\n$$\\Delta s(t, \\theta) = d_y(t) \\sin\\theta$$\nThe problem requires the displacement as a function of time $t$ only. The projection angle $\\theta$ is related to time by $\\theta(t) = \\omega t$, where the angular velocity is given as $\\omega = 2\\pi$ rad/s. Substituting the expressions for $d_y(t)$ and $\\theta(t)$:\n$$\\Delta s(t) = (25t) \\sin(2\\pi t)$$\nThis is the expression for the sinogram displacement in millimeters for $t$ in the interval $[0, 0.2]$.\n\nTo justify the orientation of the predominant blur, we analyze the derived sinogram displacement, $\\Delta s(t) = d_y(t) \\sin(\\theta(t))$. This displacement represents the error or inconsistency in the acquired sinogram data due to the motion. The magnitude of this error is modulated by the term $\\sin(\\theta(t))$.\nThe error is maximized when $|\\sin(\\theta)| = 1$, which occurs at projection angles $\\theta = \\pi/2$ and $\\theta = 3\\pi/2$. At these angles, the parallel X-ray beams are horizontal, meaning they are perpendicular to the direction of motion (the anterior, or $y$, direction). A vertical shift of the object causes the largest possible shift in the horizontal projection data.\nConversely, the error is minimized (zero) when $\\sin(\\theta) = 0$, which occurs at angles $\\theta = 0$ and $\\theta = \\pi$. At these angles, the X-ray beams are vertical, parallel to the direction of motion. A vertical shift of the object merely moves it along the integration paths, which does not change the values of the line integrals. Thus, these projections are not corrupted by the motion.\nIn filtered backprojection (FBP), the algorithm processes all projections. The projections that are most corrupted (those near $\\theta = \\pi/2$ and $\\theta = 3\\pi/2$) introduce significant high-frequency errors into the reconstruction process. When these corrupted and filtered projections are backprojected, they create prominent streaking artifacts. The streaks from an inconsistent projection at angle $\\theta$ are oriented perpendicular to the ray direction at that angle. For corrupted projections near $\\theta = \\pi/2$, the rays are horizontal, and the resulting streaks are vertical (i.e., along the $y$-axis).\nThe cumulative effect of these streaks across the corrupted angular range is a blurring and smearing of features in the reconstructed image. Since the artifacts are most pronounced in the direction perpendicular to the most corrupted views, and those views are perpendicular to the motion, the artifacts are most prominent in the direction of the motion itself. Therefore, a rigid anterior translation (along the $+y$-axis) will produce a predominant blur oriented along the anterior-posterior direction (the $y$-axis).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{25t \\sin(2\\pi t)}$$", "id": "4901661"}, {"introduction": "Corrupted sinogram data inevitably leads to a corrupted image, but how exactly does this happen?

Distances are in millimeters. Exactly midway through the scan, at angle $\\theta=\\pi/2$, the object undergoes a rigid-body translation by $\\delta$ millimeters along the $+x$ direction and then remains fixed at the new position for the remainder of the scan.

This operator takes a sinogram (a set of projection data $p(t, \\theta)$) and produces a two-dimensional image.
