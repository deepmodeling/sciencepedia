A linear relationship can be expressed in the general form:\n$$ \\mathrm{HU}(\\mu) = K \\mu + C $$\nwhere $K$ and $C$ are constants. To determine these constants, we use the two anchoring points provided in the problem definition.\n\nFirst anchor point: Distilled water is assigned $0$ HU.

The solution proceeds in three main parts: first, determining the ideal CT number for acrylic; second, modeling the scanner's calibration drift based on a water measurement to predict the corresponding acrylic CT number; and third, calculating the z-score.\n\nThe Hounsfield scale relates the linear attenuation coefficient, $\\mu_x$, of a material $x$ to a CT number, expressed in Hounsfield Units (HU). The definition is:\n$$CT_x = K \\frac{\\mu_x - \\mu_{\\text{ref}}}{\\mu_{\\text{ref}}}$$\nwhere $\\mu_{\\text{ref}}$ is the linear attenuation coefficient of a reference material and $K$ is a scaling constant. For medical CT, the reference material is water, and the scaling constant is $K = 1000$.\n\nFirst, we compute the expected CT number for acrylic under ideal calibration conditions.
