It also asks for the point spread function (PSF) of the simple back-projection process. This is a classic problem in medical imaging theory. The definitions are standard. The object is a Dirac delta function, a standard model for a point source. The tasks are well-defined: derive the back-projected image, find its Fourier transform, and explain the role of a filter in FBP. Everything seems valid.\n\n2.  **Solve the problem**:\n    *   **Part 1: Derive the simple back-projection image `b(x,y)`**\n        *   Start with the object: `f(x,y) = δ(x)δ(y)`.\n        *   Calculate its Radon transform, `p(θ, s) = Rf(θ, s)`.\n        *   Substitute `f(x,y)` into the Radon transform integral:\n            `p(θ, s) = ∫∫ δ(x)δ(y) δ(s - xcosθ - ysinθ) dx dy`.\n        *   Use the sifting property of the Dirac delta function. The integral will be non-zero only at `(x,y) = (0,0)`.\n            `p(θ, s) = δ(s - 0*cosθ - 0*sinθ) = δ(s)`.\n            So, the projections of a point object at the origin are all delta functions at `s=0`, regardless of the angle `θ`. This makes physical sense: all rays passing through the origin will have a detector coordinate `s=0`.\n        *   Now, apply the simple back-projection operator `B` to this result `p(θ, s) = δ(s)`.\n            `b(x,y) = Bp(x,y) = ∫₀^π p(θ, xcosθ + ysinθ) dθ`.\n        *   Substitute `p(θ,s) = δ(s)` into the back-projection formula:\n            `b(x,y) = ∫₀^π δ(xcosθ + ysinθ) dθ`.\n        *   This integral is the PSF of the simple back-projection operator.\n        *   To evaluate it, I need to find the roots of the argument of the delta function: `g(θ) = xcosθ + ysinθ = 0`.\n        *   Let `x = r cosφ` and `y = r sinφ`. Then the argument becomes:\n            `g(θ) = r cosφ cosθ + r sinφ sinθ = r cos(θ - φ)`.\n        *   The roots are where `cos(θ - φ) = 0`, which means `θ - φ = π/2 + nπ` for integer `n`.\n        *   So, `θ = φ + π/2 + nπ`.\n        *   The integral is over `θ ∈ [0, π)`. I need to find the roots within this interval.\n        *   Let's analyze the argument `g(θ) = r cos(θ - φ)`.\n        *   The roots are `θ₀` such that `g(θ₀) = 0`.\n        *   The integral can be evaluated using the property `∫ δ(g(x)) f(x) dx = ∑ᵢ f(xᵢ) / |g'(xᵢ)|` where `g(xᵢ) = 0`.\n        *   Here, `g(θ) = xcosθ + ysinθ`. The function `f(θ)` being integrated is just `1`.\n        *   `g'(θ) = -xsinθ + ycosθ`.\n        *   We need to solve `xcosθ + ysinθ = 0` for `θ ∈ [0, π)`.\n        *   This is `tanθ = -x/y`, assuming `y ≠ 0`.\n        *   Let `α = arctan(-x/y)`. The general solution is `θ = α + nπ`.\n        *   Since `θ` must be in `[0, π)`, there is exactly one solution in this interval for any `(x,y) ≠ (0,0)`. Let's call this root `θ₀`.\n        *   The value of the integral is `1 / |g'(θ₀)|`.\n        *   `g'(θ) = -xsinθ + ycosθ`.\n        *   `|g'(θ₀)| = |-xsinθ₀ + ycosθ₀|`.\n        *   From `tanθ₀ = -x/y`, we have `sinθ₀ / cosθ₀ = -x/y`.\n        *   This implies `y sinθ₀ = -x cosθ₀`.\n        *   Let's assume `cosθ₀ ≠ 0`. Then `sinθ₀ = -(x/y)cosθ₀`.\n        *   `|g'(θ₀)| = |-x(-(x/y)cosθ₀) + ycosθ₀| = |(x²/y + y)cosθ₀| = |(x²+y²)/y * cosθ₀|`.\n        *   We also know `sin²θ₀ + cos²θ₀ = 1`. So `(-(x/y)cosθ₀)² + cos²θ₀ = 1`.\n        *   `cos²θ₀ (x²/y² + 1) = 1` => `cos²θ₀ (x²+y²)/y² = 1` => `cos²θ₀ = y²/(x²+y²)`.\n        *   So `|cosθ₀| = |y| / √(x²+y²) = |y|/r`.\n        *   Substituting this back: `|g'(θ₀)| = |(r²/y) * (±y/r)| = |±r| = r`. Wait, this seems too simple. Let me re-check.\n        *   `|g'(θ₀)| = |(x²+y²)/y * cosθ₀| = (r²/|y|) * (|y|/r) = r`. This seems correct.\n        *   What if `y=0`? Then `tanθ₀` is undefined. If `y=0`, the equation `g(θ₀)=0` becomes `xcosθ₀ = 0`. Since `(x,y) ≠ (0,0)`, we must have `x≠0`. So `cosθ₀ = 0`, which means `θ₀ = π/2`. This is in the interval `[0, π)`.\n        *   Let's evaluate `|g'(θ₀)|` in this case. `g'(θ) = -xsinθ`. At `θ₀ = π/2`, `g'(π/2) = -xsin(π/2) = -x`.\n        *   So `|g'(π/2)| = |-x| = |x|`. Since `y=0`, `r = √(x²+0²) = |x|`. So `|g'(θ₀)| = r` holds.\n        *   What if `x=0`? The equation becomes `ysinθ₀ = 0`. Since `y≠0`, `sinθ₀ = 0`. So `θ₀ = 0` (or `π`, but `π` is not in the interval). `θ₀=0`.\n        *   `g'(θ) = ycosθ`. `g'(0) = ycos(0) = y`. So `|g'(0)| = |y|`. Since `x=0`, `r = √(0²+y²) = |y|`. So `|g'(θ₀)| = r` holds again.\n        *   So, `b(x,y) = 1 / |g'(θ₀)| = 1/r`.\n        *   This is the classic `1/r` blurring PSF of simple back-projection.\n        *   So, `b(x,y) = 1/√(x²+y²)`. As a function of `r`, `b(r) = 1/r`.\n        *   This applies for `r > 0`. At `r=0`, the integral `∫₀^π δ(0) dθ` is infinite, which is consistent with `1/r` blowing up at `r=0`.\n\n    *   **Part 2: Fourier Transform and FBP explanation**\n        *   I need to compute the 2D Fourier transform of `b(x,y) = 1/r = 1/√(x²+y²)`.\n        *   Let `B(k_x, k_y) = F₂{b(x,y)}`.\n        *   This is a known Fourier transform pair. The 2D FT of `1/r` is `2π/κ`, where `κ = √(k_x² + k_y²)`.\n        *   Let's check the relation `B(k) = (c/κ) F(k)`.\n        *   Let's check the definition of the Radon transform.\n        *   `Rf(θ,s) = ∫ f(x) δ(s - x·n) dx` where `n=(cosθ, sinθ)`. This is the standard definition.\n        *   The Central Slice Theorem with this definition is `P(θ,ω) = F(ω cosθ, ω sinθ)`.\n        *   `P(θ,ω) = ∫ (∫ f(x)δ(s - x·n) dx) exp(-iωs) ds = ∫ f(x) (∫ δ(s - x·n) exp(-iωs) ds) dx`\n        *   `= ∫ f(x) exp(-iω(x·n)) dx = ∫ f(x) exp(-i(ω cosθ x + ω sinθ y)) dx dy`\n        *   This is exactly `F(k_x,k_y)` with `k_x=ω cosθ, k_y=ω sinθ`. So the Central Slice Theorem holds with no extra factors for these definitions.\n\n        *   Let's re-run the `B(k)` derivation carefully.\n        *   `b(x,y) = ∫₀^π p(θ, xcosθ + ysinθ) dθ`\n        *   `B(k_x, k_y) = F₂{b(x,y)} = ∫ F₂{p(θ, xcosθ + ysinθ)} dθ`\n        *   Let `g_θ(x,y) = p(θ, xcosθ + ysinθ)`.\n        *   Rotate coordinates `(s,t)` s.t. `s = xcosθ + ysinθ`. `g_θ` is `p(θ,s)`. It's a 1D function extruded along the `t` axis.\n        *   `F₂{g_θ(x,y)}` becomes `F₁{p(θ,s)}(ω_s) * F₁{1(t)}(ω_t)`.\n        *   `F₁{1(t)}(ω_t) = ∫ 1 * exp(-iω_t t) dt = 2π δ(ω_t)`.\n        *   The frequency coordinates `(ω_s, ω_t)` correspond to the rotated k-space coordinates.\n        *   So `F₂{g_θ} = P(θ, k_x cosθ + k_y sinθ) * 2π δ(-k_x sinθ + k_y cosθ)`.\n        *   This derivation seems correct. And the integration `∫₀^π ... dθ` gives `B(k) = (2π/κ) P(θ_k, κ)`.\n        *   Using slice theorem, `P(θ_k, κ) = F(k)`.\n        *   So `B(k) = (2π/κ)F(k)`.\n        *   This means the transfer function of the simple back-projection process is `H_{sys}(κ) = 2π/κ`.\n        *   For the specific case `f(x,y)=δ(x)δ(y)`, we have `F(k_x, k_y)=1`.\n        *   Then `B(k_x, k_y)` which is the FT of the PSF `b(x,y)`, is `2π/κ`.\n        *   The problem calls the magnitude-only frequency response of the PSF `H(κ)`.\n        *   So `H(κ) = |2π/κ| = 2π/κ` for `κ ≥ 0`.\n\n        *   **Final part: FBP explanation.**\n        *   The reconstructed image from simple B-P is `b(x,y)`. Its FT is `B(k) = (2π/κ) F(k)`.\n        *   We want to recover `f(x,y)`, whose FT is `F(k)`.\n        *   Filtered Back-Projection (FBP) does the filtering *before* back-projection.\n        *   The process is `f -> p -> filtered p -> back-projected result`.\n        *   Let the filtered projection's FT be `P_f(θ,ω) = P(θ,ω) * Q(ω)`, where `Q(ω)` is the FBP filter.\n        *   The back-projected result `f_{rec}(x,y)` will have a 2D FT `F_{rec}(k)`.\n        *   Using the same logic, `F_{rec}(k_x, k_y) = (2π/κ) * P_f(θ_k, κ)`.\n        *   Substitute `P_f = P * Q`: `F_{rec}(k_x, k_y) = (2π/κ) * P(θ_k, κ) * Q(κ)`.\n        *   Using slice theorem `P(θ_k, κ) = F(k_x, k_y)`:\n        *   `F_{rec}(k) = (2π/κ) * F(k) * Q(κ)`.\n        *   We want `f_{rec} = f`, so we need `F_{rec}(k) = F(k)`.\n        *   This requires `(2π/κ) * Q(κ) = 1`.\n        *   So, `Q(κ) = κ / (2π)`.\n        *   The frequency variable for the 1D filter is `ω`. By the slice theorem, `ω` corresponds to `κ`. So the filter should be `Q(ω) = |ω|/2π`. It is customary to use the magnitude `|ω|` to create a real-valued filter, known as a ramp filter.\n        *   The transfer function of simple back-projection is `H(κ) = 2π/κ`. The magnitude response of the required pre-filter is `|Q(ω)| = |ω|/2π`.\n        *   The filter `|Q(ω)|` is proportional to `|ω|`, which cancels the `1/κ` dependence of the back-projection blur `H(κ)`. The product of the two effects (filtering and back-projecting) yields a constant response, thus correcting the blur.\n\n3.  **Final Assembly**:\n    *   State the problem is valid.\n    *   **Part 1**: Derivation of `b(r)`.\n        *   `f(x,y) = δ(x)δ(y)`\n        *   `p(θ,s) = Rf = δ(s)`\n        *   `b(x,y) = Bp = ∫₀^π δ(xcosθ + ysinθ) dθ`\n        *   Evaluation of the integral using properties of delta functions.\n        *   `g(θ) = xcosθ + ysinθ`.

The provided definitions are consistent with one another.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the simple backprojection image $b(x,y)$ for the given object $f(x,y)$. The process involves two steps: calculating the Radon transform (projections) and then backprojecting the result.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Radon Transform**\nThe object is a unit-amplitude point source at the origin: $f(x,y) = \\delta(x)\\delta(y)$. Its Radon transform, $p(\\theta,s) = \\mathcal{R}f(\\theta,s)$, is computed by substituting $f(x,y)$ into the given definition:\n$$\np(\\theta,s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(x)\\delta(y)\\,\\delta\\!\\big(s - x\\cos\\theta - y\\sin\\theta\\big)\\,dx\\,dy\n$$\nUsing the sifting property of the two-dimensional Dirac delta function, $\\int\\int g(x,y)\\delta(x-x_0)\\delta(y-y_0)dxdy=g(x_0,y_0)$, we evaluate the integral at $(x,y)=(0,0)$:\n$$\np(\\theta,s) = \\delta\\!\\big(s - (0)\\cos\\theta - (0)\\sin\\theta\\big) = \\delta(s)\n$$\nThis result indicates that the projections of a point object at the origin are Dirac delta functions at the detector coordinate $s=0$ for all view angles $\\theta \\in [0,\\pi)$.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Simple Backprojection Operator**\nThe simple backprojection image is $b(x,y) = \\mathcal{B}p(x,y)$. We substitute $p(\\theta,s) = \\delta(s)$ into the backprojection formula:\n$$\nb(x,y) = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} p\\!\\big(\\theta,\\,x\\cos\\theta + y\\sin\\theta\\big)\\,d\\theta = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\delta(x\\cos\\theta + y\\sin\\theta)\\,d\\theta\n$$\nThis expression represents the point spread function (PSF) of the simple backprojection imaging process. To evaluate the integral, we use the property of the Dirac delta function for a composite argument, $\\int \\delta(g(t))h(t)dt = \\sum_{i} \\frac{h(t_i)}{|g'(t_i)|}$, where $t_i$ are the simple roots of $g(t)=0$.\n\nHere, the integration variable is $\\theta$, the function inside the delta is $g(\\theta)=x\\cos\\theta + y\\sin\\theta$, and we are integrating the constant function $h(\\theta)=1$. We need to find the roots of $g(\\theta)=0$ in the interval $\\theta \\in [0,\\pi)$ for a given point $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$.\n$$\nx\\cos\\theta + y\\sin\\theta = 0 \\implies \\tan\\theta = -\\frac{x}{y}\n$$\nFor any $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$, there is exactly one solution $\\theta_0$ in the interval $[0,\\pi)$.\n\nNext, we calculate the derivative $g'(\\theta_0)$:\n$$\ng'(\\theta) = -x\\sin\\theta + y\\cos\\theta\n$$\nWe need to find the magnitude $|g'(\\theta_0)| = |-x\\sin\\theta_0 + y\\cos\\theta_0|$.\nAt the root $\\theta_0$, we have $y\\sin\\theta_0 = -x\\cos\\theta_0$. Assuming $\\cos\\theta_0 \\ne 0$ (i.e., $y \\ne 0$), we substitute this into the expression for $g'(\\theta_0)$:\n$$\ng'(\\theta_0) = -x\\sin\\theta_0 - \\frac{x\\cos\\theta_0}{\\sin\\theta_0}\\cos\\theta_0 = -x\\frac{\\sin^2\\theta_0+\\cos^2\\theta_0}{\\sin\\theta_0} = -\\frac{x}{\\sin\\theta_0}\n$$\nUsing the identity $1+\\tan^2\\theta_0 = \\sec^2\\theta_0$, we have $1+(-x/y)^2 = 1/\\cos^2\\theta_0$, which gives $\\cos^2\\theta_0 = y^2/(x^2+y^2)$. Similarly, $\\sin^2\\theta_0 = x^2/(x^2+y^2)$.\nSo, $|\\sin\\theta_0| = |x|/\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = |x|/r$.\nThus, $|g'(\\theta_0)| = | -x / (\\pm |x|/r) | = r$.\n\nAlternatively, and more elegantly, we can use polar coordinates $x=r\\cos\\phi$, $y=r\\sin\\phi$.\nThe argument of the delta function is $g(\\theta) = r\\cos\\phi\\cos\\theta + r\\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta = r\\cos(\\theta-\\phi)$. The root $\\theta_0$ satisfies $\\cos(\\theta_0-\\phi)=0$.\nThe derivative is $g'(\\theta) = -r\\sin(\\theta-\\phi)$.\nAt the root $\\theta_0$, $|\\sin(\\theta_0-\\phi)|=1$. Therefore, $|g'(\\theta_0)| = |-r\\sin(\\theta_0-\\phi)| = r$.\n\nThe integral evaluates to:\n$$\nb(x,y) = \\frac{1}{|g'(\\theta_0)|} = \\frac{1}{r}\n$$\nSince $r = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$, the backprojected image is $b(x,y) = 1/\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. As a purely radial function, this is:\n$$\nb(r) = \\frac{1}{r}\n$$\nThis function describes the characteristic \"$1/r$\" blurring of simple backprojection.\n\nNext, we address the frequency domain analysis. The overall imaging process (Radon transform followed by simple backprojection) can be represented by a linear operator whose output in the Fourier domain, $B(k_x, k_y) = \\mathcal{F}_2\\{b(x,y)\\}$, is related to the input Fourier transform $F(k_x, k_y) = \\mathcal{F}_2\\{f(x,y)\\}$.

This implies that the filter $Q(\\kappa)$ must satisfy:\n$$\n\\frac{2\\pi}{\\kappa} Q(\\kappa) = 1 \\implies Q(\\kappa) = \\frac{\\kappa}{2\\pi}\n$$\nThe required filter is a ramp filter. Its magnitude response, as a function of the one-dimensional projection frequency variable $\\omega$, is $|Q(\\omega)| = |\\omega|/(2\\pi)$. This filter's magnitude $|\\omega|$ is precisely what is needed to cancel the $1/\\kappa$ blurring effect of the backprojection operator $H(\\kappa)$, as $|\\omega|$ corresponds to $\\kappa$ on the respective slice in the frequency domain. The product of the filter response and the backprojection response is constant, leading to a restored image.\n\nThe question asks for the closed-form analytic expression for $b(r)$.
