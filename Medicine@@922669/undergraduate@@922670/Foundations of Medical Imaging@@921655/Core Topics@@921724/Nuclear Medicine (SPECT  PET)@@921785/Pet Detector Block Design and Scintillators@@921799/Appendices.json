A complete solution will be provided.\n\nWe begin by deriving the Compton scattering formula, which relates the energy of a scattered photon to its scattering angle, based on the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nLet $E_0$ and $\\vec{p}_0$ be the energy and momentum of the incident photon, respectively. The photon collides with an electron assumed to be free and at rest. The rest energy of the electron is $m_e c^2$, where $m_e$ is the electron mass and $c$ is the speed of light. Its initial momentum is zero.\n\nAfter the collision, the photon is scattered with energy $E'$ and momentum $\\vec{p}'$. The electron recoils with kinetic energy $K_e$ and momentum $\\vec{p}_e$. The total energy of the recoiling electron is $E_e = m_e c^2 + K_e$. The angle between the incident photon direction and the scattered photon direction is $\\theta$.\n\nThe conservation of energy dictates:\n$$E_0 + m_e c^2 = E' + E_e$$\nThe conservation of momentum dictates:\n$$\\vec{p}_0 = \\vec{p}' + \\vec{p}_e$$\nFrom the momentum conservation equation, we can write $\\vec{p}_e = \\vec{p}_0 - \\vec{p}'$. We can find the magnitude squared of the electron's momentum by taking the dot product of this equation with itself:\n$$p_e^2 = (\\vec{p}_0 - \\vec{p}') \\cdot (\\vec{p}_0 - \\vec{p}') = p_0^2 + p'^2 - 2\\vec{p}_0 \\cdot \\vec{p}'$$\n$$p_e^2 = p_0^2 + p'^2 - 2 p_0 p' \\cos(\\theta)$$\nFor a photon, the relationship between energy $E$ and momentum magnitude $p$ is $E = pc$. Thus, $p_0 = E_0/c$ and $p' = E'/c$. Substituting these into the equation for $p_e^2$:\n$$(p_e c)^2 = E_0^2 + E'^2 - 2 E_0 E' \\cos(\\theta)$$\n\nNow we use the energy conservation equation. Rearranging it for the total energy of the recoil electron gives $E_e = E_0 - E' + m_e c^2$. We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation for the electron, $E_e^2 = (p_e c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$. Substituting our expression for $E_e$:\n$$(E_0 - E' + m_e c^2)^2 = (p_e c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$$\nExpanding the left side:\n$$E_0^2 + E'^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 - 2E_0 E' + 2E_0 m_e c^2 - 2E' m_e c^2 = (p_e c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$$\nSimplifying by subtracting $(m_e c^2)^2$ from both sides and rearranging gives an expression for $(p_e c)^2$:\n$$(p_e c)^2 = E_0^2 + E'^2 - 2E_0 E' + 2(E_0 - E')m_e c^2$$\n\nWe now have two expressions for $(p_e c)^2$, which we can equate:\n$$E_0^2 + E'^2 - 2 E_0 E' \\cos(\\theta) = E_0^2 + E'^2 - 2E_0 E' + 2(E_0 - E')m_e c^2$$\nThe terms $E_0^2$ and $E'^2$ cancel from both sides:\n$$-2 E_0 E' \\cos(\\theta) = -2E_0 E' + 2(E_0 - E')m_e c^2$$\nDividing the entire equation by $2$:\n$$-E_0 E' \\cos(\\theta) = -E_0 E' + (E_0 - E')m_e c^2$$\nRearranging the terms to isolate the one containing $m_e c^2$:\n$$E_0 E' - E_0 E' \\cos(\\theta) = (E_0 - E')m_e c^2$$\n$$E_0 E' (1 - \\cos(\\theta)) = (E_0 - E')m_e c^2$$\nTo solve for $E'$, we divide by $E_0 E' m_e c^2$:\n$$\\frac{1 - \\cos(\\theta)}{m_e c^2} = \\frac{E_0 - E'}{E_0 E'} = \\frac{1}{E'} - \\frac{1}{E_0}$$\nRearranging to solve for $1/E'$:\n$$\\frac{1}{E'} = \\frac{1}{E_0} + \\frac{1 - \\cos(\\theta)}{m_e c^2}$$\nTaking the inverse gives one form of the final expression for $E'$. A more common form is derived by combining the terms on the right-hand side:\n$$\\frac{1}{E'} = \\frac{m_e c^2 + E_0(1 - \\cos(\\theta))}{E_0 m_e c^2}$$\nInverting this gives the derived expression for the scattered photon energy:\n$$E' = \\frac{E_0 m_e c^2}{m_e c^2 + E_0(1 - \\cos(\\theta))}$$\nThis can also be written as:\n$$E' = \\frac{E_0}{1 + \\frac{E_0}{m_e c^2}(1 - \\cos(\\theta))}$$\n\nNow, we use this formula to calculate the energy of the scattered photon.
