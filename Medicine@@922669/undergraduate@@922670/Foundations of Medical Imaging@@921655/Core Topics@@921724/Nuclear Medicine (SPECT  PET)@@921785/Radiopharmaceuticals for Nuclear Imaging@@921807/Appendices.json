No flaws outlined in the validation protocol are present. Thus, a solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation and calculation of two quantities: the saturation activity of a radionuclide produced by proton bombardment, and the time required to reach a specific fraction of this activity.\n\nFirst, we derive the governing differential equation for the number of radioactive atoms, $N(t)$, in the target. The rate of change of $N(t)$, denoted by $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$, is the difference between the production rate, $R_{prod}$, and the decay rate, $R_{decay}$.\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = R_{prod} - R_{decay} $$\n\nThe production rate, $R_{prod}$, is determined by the flux of incident protons and the probability of a successful nuclear reaction. The electric current $I$ is defined as the rate of flow of charge, $I = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q}{\\mathrm{d}t}$. Since each proton carries an elementary charge $q$, the number of protons, $N_p$, corresponding to a charge $Q$ is $N_p = \\frac{Q}{q}$. The rate of protons incident on the target, $\\dot{N}_p = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N_p}{\\mathrm{d}t}$, is therefore related to the current by:\n$$ \\dot{N}_p = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\left(\\frac{Q}{q}\\right) = \\frac{1}{q}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{I}{q} $$\nThe problem provides an effective probability, $p$, that an incident proton induces the desired nuclear reaction. Assuming each successful reaction produces one radioactive atom, the production rate of these atoms is constant and given by:\n$$ R_{prod} = p \\cdot \\dot{N}_p = \\frac{pI}{q} $$\nThe problem states that the decay process follows the law $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\lambda N$ in the absence of production. This implies that the rate of decay is proportional to the number of radioactive atoms present at time $t$:\n$$ R_{decay} = \\lambda N(t) $$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the decay constant.\n\nCombining the production and decay rates, we obtain the governing first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $N(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{pI}{q} - \\lambda N(t) $$\n\nSaturation is a steady-state condition where the number of radioactive atoms becomes constant. This occurs when the production rate equals the decay rate, leading to $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0$. Let $N_{sat}$ be the number of atoms at saturation. Setting the derivative to zero, we have:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{pI}{q} - \\lambda N_{sat} $$\nSolving for $N_{sat}$ yields:\n$$ N_{sat} = \\frac{pI}{q\\lambda} $$\nThe activity, $A(t)$, is defined as $A(t) = \\lambda N(t)$. The saturation activity, $A_{sat}$, is therefore:\n$$ A_{sat} = \\lambda N_{sat} = \\lambda \\left(\\frac{pI}{q\\lambda}\\right) = \\frac{pI}{q} $$\nThis result demonstrates that the saturation activity is determined solely by the constant production rate.\n\nWe can now compute the numerical value of $A_{sat}$ using the provided data: $I = 2.0 \\times 10^{-5}$ $\\mathrm{A}$ (which is $2.0 \\times 10^{-5}$ C/s), $p = 2.5 \\times 10^{-5}$, and $q = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}$ $\\mathrm{C}$.\n$$ A_{sat} = \\frac{(2.5 \\times 10^{-5})(2.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{C/s})}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{C}} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-10}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}} $$\nThe unit $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ is equivalent to Becquerel (Bq).\n$$ A_{sat} \\approx 3.1210986 \\times 10^{9} \\ \\mathrm{Bq} $$\nTo express this in gigabecquerel (GBq), where $1 \\ \\mathrm{GBq} = 10^9 \\ \\mathrm{Bq}$:\n$$ A_{sat} \\approx 3.1210986 \\ \\mathrm{GBq} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $A_{sat} = 3.12 \\ \\mathrm{GBq}$.\n\nNext, we derive an expression for the time $t_{0.95}$ for Fluorine-$18$ to reach a fraction $f = 0.95$ of its saturation activity, starting with $N(0) = 0$. To do this, we must solve the differential equation for $N(t)$. The equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\lambda N = \\frac{pI}{q} $$\nThis is a standard form whose general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution, $N_h(t)$, and a particular solution, $N_p(t)$. The homogeneous equation $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N_h}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\lambda N_h = 0$ has the solution $N_h(t) = C \\exp(-\\lambda t)$, where $C$ is a constant. For the particular solution, since the right-hand side is constant, we try $N_p(t) = K$. Substituting into the full equation gives $0 + \\lambda K = \\frac{pI}{q}$, so $K = \\frac{pI}{q\\lambda} = N_{sat}$.\nThe general solution is:\n$$ N(t) = C \\exp(-\\lambda t) + N_{sat} $$\nApplying the initial condition $N(0) = 0$:\n$$ 0 = C \\exp(0) + N_{sat} \\implies C = -N_{sat} $$\nThus, the specific solution for the number of atoms as a function of time is:\n$$ N(t) = N_{sat} - N_{sat}\\exp(-\\lambda t) = N_{sat}(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t)) $$\nThe activity as a function of time is $A(t) = \\lambda N(t)$:\n$$ A(t) = \\lambda N_{sat}(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t)) = A_{sat}(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t)) $$\nWe seek the time $t_{0.95}$ at which $A(t_{0.95}) = f \\cdot A_{sat}$ with $f=0.95$.\n$$ f \\cdot A_{sat} = A_{sat}(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t_{0.95})) $$\n$$ f = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t_{0.95}) $$\n$$ \\exp(-\\lambda t_{0.95}) = 1 - f $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -\\lambda t_{0.95} = \\ln(1 - f) $$\n$$ t_{0.95} = -\\frac{\\ln(1 - f)}{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - f}\\right)}{\\lambda} $$\nThe decay constant $\\lambda$ is related to the half-life $T_{1/2}$ by the fundamental decay equation $N(T_{1/2}) = N_0/2 = N_0\\exp(-\\lambda T_{1/2})$, which gives $\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}}$.
