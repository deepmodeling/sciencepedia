It is free from scientific unsoundness, ambiguity, and contradiction. We may therefore proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the system resolution, $R_{\\text{sys}}(z)$, of a gamma camera system and its numerical calculation at three specified distances from the collimator face. The total system resolution is determined by the combination of the collimator's geometric resolution, $R_{\\text{col}}(z)$, and the detector's intrinsic resolution, $R_{\\text{int}}$.\n\nFirst, we derive an expression for the geometric resolution of the parallel-hole collimator, $R_{\\text{col}}(z)$. The problem states we should start from fundamental geometric considerations. The geometric resolution at a distance $z$ from the collimator face is defined as the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the geometric component of the point spread function (PSF). By the principle of reciprocity, this is equivalent to the diameter of the region on the source plane (at distance $z$) from which photons can pass through a single collimator hole to reach a single point on the detector crystal.\n\nLet's consider a point on the detector crystal located on the central axis of a single collimator hole. This hole has a diameter $d$ and a length $L$. The detector point is at one end of the hole (the exit), and the entrance of the hole is at a distance $L$ from the detector. The source plane is at a distance $z$ from the hole entrance.\n\nWe can use similar triangles to determine the diameter of the field of view, which corresponds to $R_{\\text{col}}(z)$. One triangle is formed with its vertex at the detector point, its height being the collimator length $L$, and its base being the diameter of the hole entrance, $d$. A second, larger triangle shares the same vertex. Its height is the distance from the detector to the source plane, which is $L+z$. Its base is the diameter of the region on the source plane that can be \"seen\" by the detector point, which we define as $R_{\\text{col}}(z)$.\n\nBased on the property of similar triangles, the ratio of the base to the height is constant. Therefore, we can write:\n$$\n\\frac{R_{\\text{col}}(z)}{L+z} = \\frac{d}{L}\n$$\nSolving for $R_{\\text{col}}(z)$, we obtain the expression for the collimator's geometric resolution:\n$$\nR_{\\text{col}}(z) = d \\frac{L+z}{L} = d \\left(1 + \\frac{z}{L}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression shows that the geometric resolution degrades linearly with increasing distance $z$ from the collimator face. At the face of the collimator, where $z=0$, the geometric resolution is simply the diameter of the hole, $R_{\\text{col}}(0) = d$.\n\nNext, we determine the total system resolution, $R_{\\text{sys}}(z)$. The problem states that the measured point spread function is dominated by geometric factors and intrinsic detector blur, and that these independent Gaussian-like blurs combine in quadrature for FWHM. The total system resolution is therefore the square root of the sum of the squares of the component resolutions:\n$$\nR_{\\text{sys}}(z) = \\sqrt{R_{\\text{col}}(z)^2 + R_{\\text{int}}^2}\n$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $R_{\\text{col}}(z)$:\n$$\nR_{\\text{sys}}(z) = \\sqrt{\\left(d \\frac{L+z}{L}\\right)^2 + R_{\\text{int}}^2}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the system resolution as a function of distance $z$.\n\nNow, we can compute the numerical values for the given parameters:\nIntrinsic resolution: $R_{\\text{int}} = 3.5 \\text{ mm}$\nCollimator hole diameter: $d = 1.5 \\text{ mm}$\nCollimator hole length: $L = 25 \\text{ mm}$\n\nThe distances must be in consistent units.

There are no contradictions.\n- **Feasibility:** The parameters describe a physically realistic imaging scenario.\n\n**Verdict:**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Adequacy Condition\n\nThe Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem states that to reconstruct a bandlimited signal without loss of information (i.e., without aliasing), the sampling frequency, $f_s$, must be at least twice the maximum frequency component of the signal, $f_{\\text{max}}$. This is expressed as the Nyquist criterion:\n$$f_s \\ge 2 f_{\\text{max}}$$\nIn the context of spatial imaging, we consider spatial frequencies, typically denoted by $k$. The sampling interval is the pixel size, $p$. The spatial sampling frequency, $k_s$, is the reciprocal of the pixel size:\n$$k_s = \\frac{1}{p}$$\nThe Nyquist criterion in the spatial domain is therefore:\n$$\\frac{1}{p} \\ge 2 k_{\\text{max}}$$\nThis can be rearranged to define the maximum allowable pixel size for alias-free sampling:\n$$p \\le \\frac{1}{2 k_{\\text{max}}}$$\nThe next step is to relate the maximum spatial frequency of the signal, $k_{\\text{max}}$, to the system's spatial resolution, $R_{\\mathrm{sys}}$. The system resolution, given as the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the point spread function (PSF), blurs the image and thus acts as a low-pass filter, limiting the high-frequency content of the final image. A system with resolution $R_{\\mathrm{sys}}$ cannot resolve details significantly smaller than this dimension.\n\nWhile an imaging system with a Gaussian-like PSF technically passes all frequencies (its Modulation Transfer Function, or MTF, is also a Gaussian that never reaches zero), we must define an effective maximum frequency, $k_{\\text{max}}$, that contains the significant information passed by the system. A standard convention in medical imaging is to relate $k_{\\text{max}}$ to the reciprocal of the spatial resolution. We define the effective maximum frequency of the signal to be sampled as:\n$$k_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{sys}}}$$\nThis convention associates the highest relevant frequency with a spatial period equal to the system's FWHM. Substituting this expression for $k_{\\text{max}}$ into the Nyquist condition for pixel size gives:\n$$p \\le \\frac{1}{2 \\left(\\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{sys}}}\\right)}$$\n$$p \\le \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{sys}}}{2}$$\nThis is the derived condition for adequate sampling. It states that the pixel size $p$ must be less than or equal to one-half of the system's spatial resolution $R_{\\mathrm{sys}}$. This is equivalent to requiring at least two pixels to span the FWHM of the system resolution.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of Pixel Size $p$\n\nThe pixel size $p$ is determined by the Field of View (FOV) and the size of the acquisition matrix. The givens are:\n- FOV dimension $L = 40\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 400\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Number of pixels along one dimension $N = 256$\n\nThe pixel size $p$ is calculated as the ratio of the FOV length to the number of pixels:\n$$p = \\frac{L}{N} = \\frac{400\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{256}$$\n$$p = \\frac{100}{64}\\,\\mathrm{mm} = \\frac{25}{16}\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 1.5625\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\n### Step 4: Definition and Computation of Adequacy Factor $A$\n\nThe problem requires a dimensionless adequacy factor, $A$, that equals $1$ at the boundary of adequacy. The boundary condition derived in Step 2 is:\n$$p = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{sys}}}{2}$$\nTo define a factor $A$ that is equal to $1$ at this boundary, we can rearrange the equation as:\n$$1 = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{sys}}}{2p}$$\nThus, we define the adequacy factor $A$ as:\n$$A = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{sys}}}{2p}$$\nThis factor is dimensionless, as it is a ratio of two lengths. For adequate sampling ($p \\le R_{\\mathrm{sys}}/2$), this factor is $A \\ge 1$. For inadequate sampling ($p > R_{\\mathrm{sys}}/2$), $A < 1$.\n\nNow, we compute the value of $A$ using the given parameters:\n- System resolution $R_{\\mathrm{sys}} = 8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Calculated pixel size $p = 1.5625\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the definition of $A$:\n$$A = \\frac{8\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{2 \\times 1.5625\\,\\mathrm{mm}}$$\n$$A = \\frac{8}{3.125}$$\n$$A = 2.56$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

Method 1: use background count density $\\lambda_{B} = C_{B}/A_{B}$ and subtract $\\lambda_{B}$ multiplied by $A_{L}$, which is equivalent to using a scaling factor $\\alpha = A_{L}/A_{B}$ applied to $C_{B}$. Method 2: compute the two strip count densities $C_{1}/N_{1}$ and $C_{2}/N_{2}$, take their arithmetic mean $\\bar{\\lambda} = \\left(C_{1}/N_{1} + C_{2}/N_{2}\\right)/2$, and subtract $\\bar{\\lambda}$ multiplied by $A_{L}$, which is equivalent to a scaling factor $\\alpha = A_{L}$ applied to the averaged background in counts per pixel. Numerically, Method 1 gives net counts $4800$, and Method 2 gives net counts $4590$.**\n-   **Method 1 analysis:** The description of the method and the identification of the scaling factor $\\alpha = A_L / A_B$ are correct. The numerical result of $4800$ net counts is also correct.\n-   **Method 2 analysis:** The description of the method matches the problem's rule: averaging the densities and multiplying by the lesion area. The phrasing \"a scaling factor $\\alpha=A_L$ applied to the averaged background in counts per pixel\" is a correct, if slightly verbose, way to describe multiplying the average density $\\bar{\\lambda}$ by the area $A_L$. The numerical result of $4590$ net counts is also correct.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Method 1: use scaling factor $\\alpha = A_{L}/A_{B}$ applied to $C_{B}$. Method 2: treat the two strips as a single combined background ROI with total counts $C_{1}+C_{2}$ and total pixels $N_{1}+N_{2}$; use scaling factor $\\alpha = A_{L}/(N_{1}+N_{2})$ applied to $C_{1}+C_{2}$. Numerically, Method 1 gives net counts $4800$, and Method 2 gives net counts $4600$.**\n-   **Method 1 analysis:** The description and numerical result are correct.\n-   **Method 2 analysis:** The proposed method is to pool the data from the two strips: $\\lambda'_{bg} = (C_1+C_2)/(N_1+N_2)$. This is a weighted average of the densities, not the arithmetic mean as specified in the problem statement, which requires computing $(\\lambda_1+\\lambda_2)/2$. Thus, the method described here is incorrect as per the problem's instructions. The calculation based on this incorrect method is $C_{\\text{net}} = 8400 - \\frac{2600+3100}{80+100} \\times 120 = 8400 - \\frac{5700}{180} \\times 120 = 8400 - 3800 = 4600$. While the numerical value $4600$ matches the described (but incorrect) method, the method itself violates the problem's definition for Method 2.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Method 1: use scaling factor $\\alpha = A_{B}/A_{L}$ applied to $C_{B}$; Method 2: average the strip counts (not densities) and subtract directly without further scaling. Numerically, Method 1 gives net counts $-9600$, and Method 2 gives net counts $5300$.**\n-   **Method 1 analysis:** The scaling factor is inverted ($\\alpha = A_B/A_L$ instead of $A_L/A_B$). This is conceptually incorrect as it fails to properly scale the background counts to the lesion area. The calculation would be $8400 - 18000 \\times (600/120) = 8400 - 90000 = -81600$, which does not match the stated $-9600$.\n-   **Method 2 analysis:** Averaging total counts from ROIs of different sizes ($ (C_1+C_2)/2 $) and subtracting this value is nonsensical; it ignores the areas over which the counts were collected.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Method 1: subtract the single background ROI mean count density $C_{B}/A_{B}$ directly from $C_{\\text{lesion}}$ without scaling; Method 2: subtract the arithmetic mean of the two strip mean count densities directly from $C_{\\text{lesion}}$ without scaling. Numerically, Method 1 gives net counts $8370$, and Method 2 gives net counts $8368.25$.**\n-   **Method 1 & 2 analysis:** Both proposed methods involve subtracting a count density (units: counts/pixel) from a total count (units: counts). This is a dimensionally inconsistent and physically meaningless operation. The numerical values provided match these invalid operations ($8400 - 30 = 8370$ and $8400 - 31.75 = 8368.25$), but the procedure is fundamentally flawed.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4912229"}]}
