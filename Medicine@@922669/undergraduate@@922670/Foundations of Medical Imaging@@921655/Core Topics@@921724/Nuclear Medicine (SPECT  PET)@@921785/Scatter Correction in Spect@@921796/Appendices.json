The problem specifies that a linear calibration maps the lower-window and upper-window counts to this estimate. The general form of this linear mapping is:\n$$S_P = a \\cdot L + b \\cdot U$$\nHere, $a$ and $b$ are system-specific coefficients that account for the relative widths of the energy windows and the shape of the scatter spectrum.

[@problem_id:4921262]", "problem": "Consider Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) with a photopeak at energy $E_m = 140$ keV. In a typical scatter correction, counts in a main energy window surrounding the photopeak are contaminated by scattered photons forming a continuum. Two commonly used empirical corrections are the Triple-Energy Window (TEW) method and the Dual-Energy Window (DEW) method. In TEW, one uses two narrow side windows located below and above the main window to estimate the continuum under the photopeak. In DEW, one uses only the lower side window, scaled by a constant, to estimate the same quantity.\n\nAssume the scatter continuum count density per unit energy near $E_m$ can be modeled as a first-order polynomial in energy, $D(E) = a + b E$, for $E$ in a narrow neighborhood of $E_m$. Let the main window have width $W_m = 20$ keV. Let the lower side window be centered at $E_L = 128$ keV with width $W_L = 6$ keV, and the upper side window be centered at $E_U = 152$ keV with width $W_U = 6$ keV.

The counts $C$ in any energy window centered at $E_c$ with width $W$ are given by the integral of the density over the window's energy range:\n$$\nC = \\int_{E_c - W/2}^{E_c + W/2} D(E) \\, dE = \\int_{E_c - W/2}^{E_c + W/2} (a+bE) \\, dE\n$$\nEvaluating the integral:\n$$\nC = \\left[ aE + \\frac{1}{2}bE^2 \\right]_{E_c - W/2}^{E_c + W/2} = a(W) + \\frac{b}{2} \\left( (E_c + W/2)^2 - (E_c - W/2)^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nC = aW + \\frac{b}{2} ( (E_c^2 + E_cW + W^2/4) - (E_c^2 - E_cW + W^2/4) ) = aW + \\frac{b}{2} (2E_cW) = (a+bE_c)W\n$$\nThis shows that for a linear density model, the total counts in a window are equal to the density at the window's center, $D(E_c) = a+bE_c$, multiplied by the window width $W$. Consequently, the average count density in the window, $C/W$, is exactly equal to the density at the center of the window, $D(E_c)$.\n\nUsing this result, the measured counts in the lower and upper side windows can be expressed as:\n$$\nC_L = D(E_L) W_L = (a+bE_L)W_L\n$$\n$$\nC_U = D(E_U) W_U = (a+bE_U)W_U\n$$\nFrom these, we can write the densities at the window centers as $D(E_L) = C_L/W_L$ and $D(E_U) = C_U/W_U$.\n\n**Derivation of the TEW Scatter Estimate ($S_{\\mathrm{TEW}}$)**\nThe Triple-Energy Window (TEW) method estimates the scatter density at the photopeak energy, $D(E_m)$, by linear interpolation between the densities at the centers of the two side windows. Since the main window is symmetrically placed between the side windows ($E_m = (E_L+E_U)/2$), the interpolated density at $E_m$ is the average of the densities at $E_L$ and $E_U$:\n$$\nD(E_m) = \\frac{D(E_L) + D(E_U)}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{C_L}{W_L} + \\frac{C_U}{W_U} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the scatter estimate by integrating across the main window width $W_m$. The scatter counts in the main window, $S_{\\mathrm{TEW}}$, are the integral of the model density $D(E)$ over the main window. Using the general result for the integral, this is:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{TEW}} = \\int_{E_m - W_m/2}^{E_m + W_m/2} D(E) \\, dE = D(E_m) W_m\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $D(E_m)$:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{TEW}} = \\frac{W_m}{2} \\left( \\frac{C_L}{W_L} + \\frac{C_U}{W_U} \\right)\n$$\n\n**Derivation of the DEW Scatter Estimate ($S_{\\mathrm{DEW}}$) and Scaling Constant**\nThe Dual-Energy Window (DEW) method estimates the scatter using only the lower window counts, $C_L$, with a scaling constant $k$: $S_{\\mathrm{DEW}} = k C_L$. The constant $k$ is determined by requiring the estimate to be exact when the scatter continuum is constant, i.e., when $b=0$.\nIf $b=0$, the density is $D(E) = a$.\nThe true scatter counts in the main window would be $S_{\\mathrm{true}} = \\int_{E_m - W_m/2}^{E_m + W_m/2} a \\, dE = aW_m$.\nThe counts in the lower window are $C_L = \\int_{E_L - W_L/2}^{E_L + W_L/2} a \\, dE = aW_L$.\nThe DEW estimate is $S_{\\mathrm{DEW}} = kC_L = k aW_L$.\nSetting $S_{\\mathrm{DEW}} = S_{\\mathrm{true}}$ gives $k aW_L = aW_m$. Assuming $a \\neq 0$, we solve for $k$:\n$$\nk = \\frac{W_m}{W_L}\n$$\nThus, the DEW scatter estimate is:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{DEW}} = \\frac{W_m}{W_L} C_L\n$$\n\n**Condition for TEW to Reduce to DEW**\nWe set the expressions for $S_{\\mathrm{TEW}}$ and $S_{\\mathrm{DEW}}$ equal to find the condition under which they are equivalent:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{TEW}} = S_{\\mathrm{DEW}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{W_m}{2} \\left( \\frac{C_L}{W_L} + \\frac{C_U}{W_U} \\right) = \\frac{W_m}{W_L} C_L\n$$\nAssuming $W_m \\neq 0$, we can cancel $W_m$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{C_L}{W_L} + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{C_U}{W_U} = \\frac{C_L}{W_L}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{C_U}{W_U} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{C_L}{W_L} \\implies \\frac{C_U}{W_U} = \\frac{C_L}{W_L}\n$$\nThis condition states that the average count density in the upper window must equal the average count density in the lower window. In terms of the linear model parameters, this is $D(E_U) = D(E_L)$, which means $a+bE_U = a+bE_L$. Since $E_U \\neq E_L$, this equality holds only if $b=0$. Therefore, TEW reduces to DEW when the slope of the scatter continuum is zero (i.e., the continuum is flat).\n\n**Derivation of Fractional Bias $B$**\nThe fractional bias $B$ is defined as $B = (S_{\\mathrm{DEW}} - S_{\\mathrm{TEW}})/S_{\\mathrm{TEW}}$. The problem specifies a symmetric window configuration, for which it is given that $W_L = W_U$. Let's denote this common width as $W_s = 6$ keV.\nIn this case, the TEW estimate simplifies to:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{TEW}} = \\frac{W_m}{2} \\left( \\frac{C_L}{W_s} + \\frac{C_U}{W_s} \\right) = \\frac{W_m}{2W_s} (C_L + C_U)\n$$\nThe DEW estimate is:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{DEW}} = \\frac{W_m}{W_s} C_L\n$$\nNow, we substitute these into the expression for $B$:\n$$\nB = \\frac{\\frac{W_m}{W_s} C_L - \\frac{W_m}{2W_s} (C_L + C_U)}{\\frac{W_m}{2W_s} (C_L + C_U)}\n$$\nThe common factor $\\frac{W_m}{2W_s}$ cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n$$\nB = \\frac{2 C_L - (C_L + C_U)}{C_L + C_U} = \\frac{C_L - C_U}{C_L + C_U}\n$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the fractional bias $B$ for the symmetric window configuration in terms of $C_L$ and $C_U$. Although the problem asked for the expression in terms of $W_L$ and $W_U$, these parameters cancel out due to the symmetric condition $W_L = W_U$ and are not present in the final simplified expression.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation of $B$**\nThe given values for the counts are $C_L = 12000$ and $C_U = 8000$. Substituting these into the expression for $B$:\n$$\nB = \\frac{12000 - 8000}{12000 + 8000} = \\frac{4000}{20000} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nB = 0.2000\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.2000}\n$$", "id": "4921262"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple windowing, modern scatter correction often employs more sophisticated model-based approaches that analyze the full energy spectrum.

This structure motivates the use of the EM algorithm.\n\n### 2. Derivation of the EM Algorithm\n\nThe EM algorithm simplifies maximization by introducing latent (unobserved) variables.\n\n#### 2.1. Latent Variables and Complete Data\n\nWe define the latent variables as the unobserved counts from each component in each channel. Let $y_{P,i}$ be the number of photopeak counts in channel $i$ and $y_{C,i}$ be the number of Compton scatter counts in channel $i$. The observed data is their sum: $y_i = y_{P,i} + y_{C,i}$.\n\nThe underlying statistical model for these latent variables is:\n$$\ny_{P,i} \\sim \\text{Poisson}(a_P s_{P,i}) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y_{C,i} \\sim \\text{Poisson}(a_C s_{C,i})\n$$\nThe set of all latent variables, $z = \\{y_{P,1}, \\dots, y_{P,N}, y_{C,1}, \\dots, y_{C,N}\\}$, along with the observed data $y$, forms the \"complete data\".\n\n#### 2.2. Complete-Data Log-Likelihood\n\nThe log-likelihood of the complete data $z$ is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{complete}}(a_P, a_C | z) = \\ln P(z|a_P,a_C) = \\ln \\left( \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{N} P(y_{P,i}|a_P)\\right) \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{N} P(y_{C,i}|a_C)\\right) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{complete}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( y_{P,i} \\ln(a_P s_{P,i}) - a_P s_{P,i} - \\ln(y_{P,i}!) \\right) + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( y_{C,i} \\ln(a_C s_{C,i}) - a_C s_{C,i} - \\ln(y_{C,i}!) \\right)\n$$\nFor maximization with respect to $a_P$ and $a_C$, we can ignore terms not dependent on these parameters. The function separates into two independent parts, one for $a_P$ and one for $a_C$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{complete}} \\propto \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_{P,i}\\right) \\ln a_P - a_P \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{P,i} + \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_{C,i}\\right) \\ln a_C - a_C \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{C,i}\n$$\nThis form is much easier to maximize.\n\n#### 2.3. E-Step (Expectation)\n\nThe EM algorithm iterates between two steps. At iteration $k+1$, the E-step consists of calculating the expectation of the complete-data log-likelihood, conditioned on the observed data $y$ and the current parameter estimates $\\{a_P^{(k)}, a_C^{(k)}\\}$. This is the Q-function:\n$$\nQ(a_P, a_C | a_P^{(k)}, a_C^{(k)}) = E[\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{complete}}(a_P, a_C | z) | y, a_P^{(k)}, a_C^{(k)}]\n$$\nThis requires finding the conditional expectation of the latent variables $y_{P,i}$ and $y_{C,i}$. Given that $y_{P,i}$ and $y_{C,i}$ are independent Poisson variables whose sum is the observed value $y_i$, their conditional distribution given $y_i$ is Binomial. The expectation of $y_{P,i}$ is:\n$$\nE[y_{P,i} | y_i, a_P^{(k)}, a_C^{(k)}] = y_i \\cdot \\frac{E[y_{P,i}]}{E[y_{P,i}] + E[y_{C,i}]} = y_i \\frac{a_P^{(k)} s_{P,i}}{a_P^{(k)} s_{P,i} + a_C^{(k)} s_{C,i}}\n$$\nLet's denote these expected values as $\\hat{y}_{P,i}^{(k+1)}$ and $\\hat{y}_{C,i}^{(k+1)}$.\n$$\n\\hat{y}_{P,i}^{(k+1)} = y_i \\frac{a_P^{(k)} s_{P,i}}{a_P^{(k)} s_{P,i} + a_C^{(k)} s_{C,i}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\hat{y}_{C,i}^{(k+1)} = y_i \\frac{a_C^{(k)} s_{C,i}}{a_P^{(k)} s_{P,i} + a_C^{(k)} s_{C,i}}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{complete}}$ gives the Q-function (up to constants):\n$$\nQ \\propto \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\hat{y}_{P,i}^{(k+1)}\\right) \\ln a_P - a_P \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{P,i} + \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\hat{y}_{C,i}^{(k+1)}\\right) \\ln a_C - a_C \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{C,i}\n$$\n\n#### 2.4. M-Step (Maximization)\n\nThe M-step updates the parameters by maximizing the Q-function with respect to $a_P$ and $a_C$. We take the partial derivatives and set them to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial a_P} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\hat{y}_{P,i}^{(k+1)}}{a_P} - \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{P,i} = 0 \\implies a_P^{(k+1)} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\hat{y}_{P,i}^{(k+1)}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{P,i}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial a_C} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\hat{y}_{C,i}^{(k+1)}}{a_C} - \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{C,i} = 0 \\implies a_C^{(k+1)} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\hat{y}_{C,i}^{(k+1)}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{C,i}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\hat{y}_{P,i}^{(k+1)}$ and $\\hat{y}_{C,i}^{(k+1)}$ yields the update equations:\n$$\na_P^{(k+1)} = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} s_{P,j}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i \\frac{a_P^{(k)} s_{P,i}}{a_P^{(k)} s_{P,i} + a_C^{(k)} s_{C,i}}\n$$\n$$\na_C^{(k+1)} = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} s_{C,j}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i \\frac{a_C^{(k)} s_{C,i}}{a_P^{(k)} s_{P,i} + a_C^{(k)} s_{C,i}}\n$$\nGiven that the bases are normalized, $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{P,i} = 1$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{C,i} = 1$, the equations simplify to:\n$$\na_P^{(k+1)} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i \\frac{a_P^{(k)} s_{P,i}}{a_P^{(k)} s_{P,i} + a_C^{(k)} s_{C,i}}\n$$\n$$\na_C^{(k+1)} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i \\frac{a_C^{(k)} s_{C,i}}{a_P^{(k)} s_{P,i} + a_C^{(k)} s_{C,i}}\n$$\n\n### 3. One Iteration of the EM Algorithm\n\nWe are given the following data:\n- Measured counts: $y = (25, 24, 56, 18, 9)$\n- Photopeak basis: $s_{P} = (0.05, 0.15, 0.60, 0.15, 0.05)$\n- Compton basis: $s_{C} = (0.40, 0.25, 0.15, 0.10, 0.10)$\n- Initial amplitudes: $a_{P}^{(0)} = 80$, $a_{C}^{(0)} = 50$\n- Normalization: $\\sum s_{P,i} = 1$ and $\\sum s_{C,i} = 1$\n\nWe need to compute the updated photopeak amplitude, $a_{P}^{(1)}$.\n\nThe update equation is:\n$$\na_{P}^{(1)} = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} y_i \\frac{a_P^{(0)} s_{P,i}}{a_P^{(0)} s_{P,i} + a_C^{(0)} s_{C,i}}\n$$\nThis sum represents the total expected number of photopeak counts across all channels, given the current parameter estimates. We calculate this sum term by term.\n\nFor $i=1$:\n$$ \\text{Term}_1 = 25 \\cdot \\frac{80 \\cdot 0.05}{80 \\cdot 0.05 + 50 \\cdot 0.40} = 25 \\cdot \\frac{4}{4 + 20} = 25 \\cdot \\frac{4}{24} = \\frac{100}{24} = \\frac{25}{6} $$\nFor $i=2$:\n$$ \\text{Term}_2 = 24 \\cdot \\frac{80 \\cdot 0.15}{80 \\cdot 0.15 + 50 \\cdot 0.25} = 24 \\cdot \\frac{12}{12 + 12.5} = 24 \\cdot \\frac{12}{24.5} = \\frac{288}{24.5} = \\frac{576}{49} $$\nFor $i=3$:\n$$ \\text{Term}_3 = 56 \\cdot \\frac{80 \\cdot 0.60}{80 \\cdot 0.60 + 50 \\cdot 0.15} = 56 \\cdot \\frac{48}{48 + 7.5} = 56 \\cdot \\frac{48}{55.5} = \\frac{2688}{55.5} = \\frac{1792}{37} $$\nFor $i=4$:\n$$ \\text{Term}_4 = 18 \\cdot \\frac{80 \\cdot 0.15}{80 \\cdot 0.15 + 50 \\cdot 0.10} = 18 \\cdot \\frac{12}{12 + 5} = 18 \\cdot \\frac{12}{17} = \\frac{216}{17} $$\nFor $i=5$:\n$$ \\text{Term}_5 = 9 \\cdot \\frac{80 \\cdot 0.05}{80 \\cdot 0.05 + 50 \\cdot 0.10} = 9 \\cdot \\frac{4}{4 + 5} = 9 \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} = 4 $$\nNow, sum the terms to find $a_{P}^{(1)}$:\n$$\na_{P}^{(1)} = \\frac{25}{6} + \\frac{576}{49} + \\frac{1792}{37} + \\frac{216}{17} + 4\n$$\n$$\na_{P}^{(1)} \\approx 4.166667 + 11.755102 + 48.432432 + 12.705882 + 4.0\n$$\n$$\na_{P}^{(1)} \\approx 81.060083\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $81.06$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{81.06}$$", "id": "4921242"}]}
