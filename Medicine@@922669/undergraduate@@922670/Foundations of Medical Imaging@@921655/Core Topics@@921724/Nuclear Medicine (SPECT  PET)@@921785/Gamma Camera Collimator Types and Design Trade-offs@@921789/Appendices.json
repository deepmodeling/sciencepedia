Consider the geometric full-width blur at half-maximum (FWHM) at an object plane located a distance $z$ in front of the collimator face. Using first-principles geometric reasoning based on similar triangles that relate the accepted ray envelope to the channel geometry, derive an expression for the geometric blur $R_g(z)$ as a function of $d$, $L$, and $z$.

The collimator is defined by channels of diameter $d$ and length $L$. The problem specifies using a first-principles geometric argument based on similar triangles.\n\nA standard and direct approach is to consider the Point Spread Function (PSF) for a detector with perfect intrinsic spatial resolution (i.e., a single point detector element). The FWHM of this PSF is the geometric resolution $R_g(z)$. We model a single channel of the collimator. Let the collimator face be at the plane $z=0$ and the detector crystal be at the plane $z=-L$. The source object is in a plane at $z$. Let a point detector element be located at the origin $(0, -L)$ on the crystal, centered at the exit of a channel. This detector element can \"see\" the source plane through the entrance aperture of the channel, which is a circle of diameter $d$ centered at the origin in the $z=0$ plane.\n\nWe can construct two similar triangles in a 2D cross-sectional view.\nTriangle 1 is formed by the point detector at $(0, -L)$ and the diameter of the channel entrance, which lies on the x-axis from $x=-d/2$ to $x=d/2$. The base of this triangle is $d$ and its height is $L$.\nTriangle 2 is formed by the same point detector at $(0, -L)$ and its field of view on the source plane at distance $z$. Let the width of this field of view be $R_g$. The base of this larger triangle is $R_g$ and its height is $L+z$.\n\nBy the property of similar triangles, the ratio of the base to the height is the same for both triangles:\n$$\n\\frac{R_g}{L+z} = \\frac{d}{L}\n$$\nSolving for $R_g$ gives the expression for the geometric blur as a function of $d$, $L$, and $z$:\n$$\nR_g(z) = d \\frac{L+z}{L} = d \\left(1 + \\frac{z}{L}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression represents the FWHM of the PSF for a point source, under the given idealizations.\n\nNext, we must find the equality condition for two different parallel-hole designs, $(d_1, L_1)$ and $(d_2, L_2)$, to produce the same geometric FWHM, $R_g$, at the same object distance $z$. We set their respective resolutions equal:\n$$\nR_{g1}(z) = R_{g2}(z)\n$$\n$$\nd_1 \\frac{L_1+z}{L_1} = d_2 \\frac{L_2+z}{L_2}\n$$\nThis equation, which can also be written as $d_1(1 + z/L_1) = d_2(1 + z/L_2)$, is the required equality condition.\n\nNow, we are given specific values for the first design and the imaging distance: $z=10\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, $d_1=1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, and $L_1=25\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. We must solve for $L_2$ as a function of $d_2$. First, we ensure all units are consistent. We will use millimeters (mm) for all lengths. Thus, $z = 10\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nLet's calculate the specific geometric resolution $R_g$ for the first design at the given distance $z$:\n$$\nR_g = d_1 \\frac{L_1+z}{L_1} = (1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}) \\frac{25\\,\\mathrm{mm} + 100\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{25\\,\\mathrm{mm}} = 1.5 \\times \\frac{125}{25} = 1.5 \\times 5 = 7.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}\n$$\nFor the second design to have the same resolution, we must have:\n$$\nR_g = d_2 \\frac{L_2+z}{L_2} = 7.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}\n$$\nWe now solve this equation for $L_2$ as a function of $d_2$, keeping $z=100\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $R_g=7.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ as constants.\n$$\n7.5 = d_2 \\left(1 + \\frac{100}{L_2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{7.5}{d_2} = 1 + \\frac{100}{L_2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{7.5}{d_2} - 1 = \\frac{100}{L_2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{7.5 - d_2}{d_2} = \\frac{100}{L_2}\n$$\nInverting both sides gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d_2}{7.5 - d_2} = \\frac{L_2}{100}\n$$\nFinally, solving for $L_2$ yields the functional expression $L_2(d_2)$:\n$$\nL_2(d_2) = 100 \\frac{d_2}{7.5 - d_2}\n$$\nThis expression gives the required channel length $L_2$ (in mm) for a given channel diameter $d_2$ (in mm) to match the geometric resolution of the first design.\n\nFor this expression to be physically meaningful, $L_2$ must be positive. Since $d_2$ (a diameter) must also be positive, the denominator must be positive: $7.5 - d_2 > 0$, which implies $0  d_2  7.5\\,\\text{mm}$.\n\nFinally, we interpret the family of equivalent-resolution pairs $(d_2, L_2)$. The relationship $L_2(d_2) = 100 \\frac{d_2}{7.5 - d_2}$ shows that as the hole diameter $d_2$ increases, the denominator decreases, and the numerator increases. Both effects cause $L_2$ to increase. Specifically, as $d_2 \\to 7.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ from below, $L_2 \\to \\infty$. This co-variance is central to the resolution-sensitivity trade-off in collimator design. The geometric resolution $R_g(z)$ has two conceptual components: an intrinsic blur due to the hole diameter $d$, and a distance-dependent blur that is proportional to $d z/L$. To maintain a constant resolution $R_g$, if one increases the hole diameter $d_2$, the intrinsic blur becomes worse. This must be counteracted by making the collimator channel much longer (increasing $L_2$) to reduce the acceptance angle for photons (proportional to $d_2/L_2$), thereby mitigating the distance-dependent blur.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{L_2(d_2) = 100 \\frac{d_2}{7.5 - d_2}}\n$$", "id": "4887721"}, {"introduction": "The design choices that determine a collimator's resolution also dictate its sensitivity—how efficiently it collects photons.

The expected number of counts, $N$, is proportional to the system sensitivity, $S$, and the acquisition time, $T$. We can express this relationship as $N = k \\cdot A \\cdot S \\cdot T$, where $A$ is the activity of the source distribution and $k$ is a proportionality constant that includes all other factors (e.g., geometric efficiency, detector intrinsic efficiency). The problem states that the source distribution and all other factors are identical, so the product $k \\cdot A$ is a constant for both measurements.\n\nThe requirement is that the coefficient of variation be the same for both protocols:\n$$CV_{LEHR} = CV_{MEGP}$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for the coefficient of variation, we get:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N_{LEHR}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N_{MEGP}}}$$\n\nSquaring both sides and taking the reciprocal yields the core condition: the total number of detected counts must be equal for both acquisitions.\n$$N_{LEHR} = N_{MEGP}$$\n\nNow we use the proportionality of counts to sensitivity and time.
