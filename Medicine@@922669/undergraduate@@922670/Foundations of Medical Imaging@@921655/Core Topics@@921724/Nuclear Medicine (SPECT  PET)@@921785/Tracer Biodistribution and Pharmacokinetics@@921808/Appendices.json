It is a standard, valid problem in the field of tracer kinetics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to find the maximum initial free ligand concentration, $[\\mathrm{L}]_{0,\\max}$, such that the fractional receptor occupancy $\\theta(t)$ does not exceed $\\varepsilon = 0.05$ for all time $t \\ge 0$.\n\nFirst, we must derive an expression for the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ in terms of the free ligand concentration $[\\mathrm{L}]$ and the dissociation constant $K_D$.\nFrom the definition of $K_D$, we can express the free receptor concentration $[\\mathrm{R}]$ as:\n$$[\\mathrm{R}] = \\frac{K_D [\\mathrm{RL}]}{[\\mathrm{L}]}$$\nThe total receptor concentration is given by $[\\mathrm{R}]_{T} = [\\mathrm{R}] + [\\mathrm{RL}]$. Substituting the expression for $[\\mathrm{R}]$:\n$$[\\mathrm{R}]_{T} = \\frac{K_D [\\mathrm{RL}]}{[\\mathrm{L}]} + [\\mathrm{RL}]$$\nFactoring out $[\\mathrm{RL}]$:\n$$[\\mathrm{R}]_{T} = [\\mathrm{RL}] \\left( \\frac{K_D}{[\\mathrm{L}]} + 1 \\right) = [\\mathrm{RL}] \\left( \\frac{K_D + [\\mathrm{L}]}{[\\mathrm{L}]} \\right)$$\nThe fractional occupancy $\\theta$ is defined as $\\theta = \\frac{[\\mathrm{RL}]}{[\\mathrm{R}]_{T}}$. Substituting the expression for $[\\mathrm{R}]_{T}$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[\\mathrm{RL}]}{[\\mathrm{RL}] \\left( \\frac{K_D + [\\mathrm{L}]}{[\\mathrm{L}]} \\right)} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{L}]}{K_D + [\\mathrm{L}]}$$\nThis is the well-known Hill-Langmuir equation for a single binding site.\n\nThe problem states that the free ligand concentration changes with time according to $[\\mathrm{L}](t) = [\\mathrm{L}]_{0}\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{el}} t)$. Therefore, the fractional occupancy also becomes a function of time:\n$$\\theta(t) = \\frac{[\\mathrm{L}](t)}{K_D + [\\mathrm{L}](t)} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{L}]_{0}\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{el}} t)}{K_D + [\\mathrm{L}]_{0}\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{el}} t)}$$\n\nThe constraint is that $\\theta(t) \\le \\varepsilon$ for all $t \\ge 0$. To satisfy this constraint for all times, we must ensure that the maximum value of $\\theta(t)$ does not exceed $\\varepsilon$. We must therefore find the maximum of $\\theta(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$.\n\nLet us analyze the function $\\theta(t)$. The occupancy $\\theta$ is a function of the free ligand concentration $[\\mathrm{L}]$. Let's examine the derivative of $\\theta$ with respect to $[\\mathrm{L}]$:\n$$\\frac{d\\theta}{d[\\mathrm{L}]} = \\frac{d}{d[\\mathrm{L}]} \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{L}]}{K_D + [\\mathrm{L}]} \\right) = \\frac{(1)(K_D + [\\mathrm{L}]) - [\\mathrm{L}](1)}{(K_D + [\\mathrm{L}])^2} = \\frac{K_D}{(K_D + [\\mathrm{L}])^2}$$\nSince $K_D > 0$ and concentrations are non-negative, the denominator is always positive. Thus, $\\frac{d\\theta}{d[\\mathrm{L}]} > 0$, which means that $\\theta$ is a monotonically increasing function of $[\\mathrm{L}]$.\n\nThe free ligand concentration is given by $[\\mathrm{L}](t) = [\\mathrm{L}]_{0}\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{el}} t)$. Since $k_{\\mathrm{el}} = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1} > 0$, the function $\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{el}} t)$ is a strictly monotonically decreasing function of time for $t \\ge 0$. Consequently, $[\\mathrm{L}](t)$ is also a monotonically decreasing function of time.\n\nSince $\\theta(t)$ is an increasing function of $[\\mathrm{L}](t)$, and $[\\mathrm{L}](t)$ is a decreasing function of $t$, it follows that $\\theta(t)$ must also be a monotonically decreasing function of time for $t \\ge 0$. Therefore, the maximum value of $\\theta(t)$ occurs at the earliest time, which is $t=0$.\n$$\\theta_{\\max} = \\theta(0) = \\frac{[\\mathrm{L}](0)}{K_D + [\\mathrm{L}](0)} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{L}]_{0}}{K_D + [\\mathrm{L}]_{0}}$$\n\nThe condition $\\theta(t) \\le \\varepsilon$ for all $t \\ge 0$ simplifies to the condition on the maximum value:\n$$\\theta_{\\max} \\le \\varepsilon$$\n$$\\frac{[\\mathrm{L}]_{0}}{K_D + [\\mathrm{L}]_{0}} \\le \\varepsilon$$\nThis is the explicit inequality that must be satisfied by $[\\mathrm{L}]_{0}$. To find the maximum allowable value, we solve for $[\\mathrm{L}]_{0}$. Since $[\\mathrm{L}]_{0}$ and $K_D$ are positive, the denominator $(K_D + [\\mathrm{L}]_{0})$ is positive, and we can multiply both sides by it without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$[\\mathrm{L}]_{0} \\le \\varepsilon(K_D + [\\mathrm{L}]_{0})$$\n$$[\\mathrm{L}]_{0} \\le \\varepsilon K_D + \\varepsilon [\\mathrm{L}]_{0}$$\n$$[\\mathrm{L}]_{0} - \\varepsilon [\\mathrm{L}]_{0} \\le \\varepsilon K_D$$\n$$[\\mathrm{L}]_{0}(1 - \\varepsilon) \\le \\varepsilon K_D$$\nGiven that $\\varepsilon = 0.05$, the term $(1 - \\varepsilon) = 0.95$ is positive. We can divide by it:\n$$[\\mathrm{L}]_{0} \\le \\frac{\\varepsilon K_D}{1 - \\varepsilon}$$\nThis inequality defines the upper bound for $[\\mathrm{L}]_{0}$. The largest possible value for $[\\mathrm{L}]_{0}$ that satisfies this condition is:\n$$[\\mathrm{L}]_{0,\\max} = \\frac{\\varepsilon K_D}{1 - \\varepsilon}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $K_D = 12\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and $\\varepsilon = 0.05$.\n$$[\\mathrm{L}]_{0,\\max} = \\frac{0.05 \\times 12}{1 - 0.05} = \\frac{0.6}{0.95}$$\n$$[\\mathrm{L}]_{0,\\max} \\approx 0.6315789... \\,\\mathrm{nM}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$[\\mathrm{L}]_{0,\\max} \\approx 0.6316\\,\\mathrm{nM}$$\nThe final answer is to be reported as a single number in units of $\\mathrm{nM}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.6316}\n$$", "id": "4938603"}, {"introduction": "Compartmental models are the workhorses of tracer kinetics, but their accuracy depends on correctly accounting for all sources of the measured signal.

The two-tissue compartment model, the concept of distribution volume $V_T$, binding potential $BP_{ND}$, and the Logan graphical analysis are all well-established scientific and mathematical tools.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data (time-activity curves and input function) and specifies all required parameters and methods for the calculation (choice of $t^*$, numerical integration method, fitting points, and output format). A unique solution can be determined.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n## SOLUTION\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Graphical Method (Logan Plot)\n\nThe mass balance equations for a linear, time-invariant, reversible two-tissue compartment model ($C_F$ for free tracer, $C_B$ for specifically bound tracer) are:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_F(t)}{dt} = K_1 C_p(t) - (k_2 + k_3) C_F(t) + k_4 C_B(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dC_B(t)}{dt} = k_3 C_F(t) - k_4 C_B(t)\n$$\nThe total observed tissue concentration is $C_T(t) = C_F(t) + C_B(t)$. Summing the two differential equations gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_T(t)}{dt} = \\frac{dC_F(t)}{dt} + \\frac{dC_B(t)}{dt} = K_1 C_p(t) - k_2 C_F(t)\n$$\nIn the Laplace domain, assuming zero initial conditions, this system of equations can be solved for the transfer function $H(s) = \\frac{\\tilde{C}_T(s)}{\\tilde{C}_p(s)}$:\n$$\nH(s) = K_1 \\frac{s + k_3 + k_4}{s^2 + (k_2+k_3+k_4)s + k_2 k_4}\n$$\nThe total distribution volume $V_T$ is defined as the steady-state ratio of tissue to plasma concentration under a constant (step) input. Using the final value theorem of Laplace transforms, this is equivalent to the transfer function gain at zero frequency:\n$$\nV_T = \\lim_{s \\to 0} H(s) = K_1 \\frac{k_3+k_4}{k_2 k_4} = \\frac{K_1}{k_2} \\left(1 + \\frac{k_3}{k_4}\\right)\n$$\nThe graphical method proposed by Logan seeks a linear relationship between functions of the measured data. Let us define the variables for the plot:\n$$\nX(t) = \\frac{\\int_0^t C_p(\\tau)d\\tau}{C_T(t)} \\quad\\quad \\text{and} \\quad\\quad Y(t) = \\frac{\\int_0^t C_T(\\tau)d\\tau}{C_T(t)}\n$$\nThe proposed linear relationship for late times ($t > t^*$) is:\n$$\nY(t) = m X(t) + b \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{\\int_0^t C_T(\\tau)d\\tau}{C_T(t)} = m \\frac{\\int_0^t C_p(\\tau)d\\tau}{C_T(t)} + b\n$$\nMultiplying by $C_T(t)$, we get $\\int_0^t C_T(\\tau)d\\tau = m \\int_0^t C_p(\\tau)d\\tau + b C_T(t)$. In the Laplace domain, this becomes $\\frac{\\tilde{C}_T(s)}{s} = m\\frac{\\tilde{C}_p(s)}{s} + b\\tilde{C}_T(s)$. Rearranging for the transfer function gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tilde{C}_T(s)}{\\tilde{C}_p(s)} = \\frac{m/s}{1/s - b} = \\frac{m}{1-bs}\n$$\nThis is the transfer function for a simpler one-tissue compartment model. For the two-tissue model, the Logan plot equation is an approximation that becomes valid at late times. To show this, we expand the true transfer function $H(s)$ as a Taylor series around $s=0$:\n$$\nH(s) = H(0) + H'(0)s + O(s^2)\n$$\nComparing this to the approximation $m/(1-bs) \\approx m(1+bs) = m + mbs$, we can identify the slope $m$ with $H(0)$ and the intercept-slope product $mb$ with $H'(0)$.\n$$\nm = H(0) = V_T\n$$\nThus, the slope of the linear portion of the Logan plot is the total distribution volume $V_T$. The relationship becomes linear for $t > t^*$, where $t^*$ is a time after which the system's dynamics are dominated by its slowest exponential component. In the frequency domain, this corresponds to the behavior for small $s$ where the $O(s^2)$ and higher terms in the Taylor expansion become negligible. The intercept $b$ is a function of all the rate constants.\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Calculation\n\nWe use the provided data and the piecewise-constant integration rule to calculate the plot coordinates for $t = 30, 45, 60$ min.\n\n**1.
