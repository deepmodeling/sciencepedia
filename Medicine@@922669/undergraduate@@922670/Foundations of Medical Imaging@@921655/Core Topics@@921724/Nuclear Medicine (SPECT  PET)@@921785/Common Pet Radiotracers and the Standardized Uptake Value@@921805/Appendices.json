The assumption regarding tissue density is explicitly stated.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe Standardized Uptake Value normalized by body weight, $SUV_{bw}$, is defined as the ratio of the decay-corrected activity concentration in a region of interest (tissue) to the total decay-corrected administered activity distributed over the entire body mass. This is expressed as:\n$$\nSUV_{bw} = \\frac{C_{\\text{tissue}}(t)}{\\frac{A_{\\text{administered, decay-corrected}}(t)}{W}}\n$$\nwhere $C_{\\text{tissue}}(t)$ is the activity concentration in the tissue at scan time $t$, $A_{\\text{administered, decay-corrected}}(t)$ is the total administered activity corrected for radioactive decay to time $t$, and $W$ is the patient's body weight.\n\nFirst, we determine the net activity that was actually administered to the patient at time $t=0$. This is the prepared injection activity, $A_{inj}$, minus the residual activity left in the syringe, $A_{res}$.\n$$\nA_{\\text{net,0}} = A_{inj} - A_{res}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nA_{\\text{net,0}} = 300 \\text{ MBq} - 2 \\text{ MBq} = 298 \\text{ MBq}\n$$\n\nNext, we must account for the radioactive decay of $^{18}\\mathrm{F}$ between the time of injection ($t=0$) and the time of the scan ($t=60$ min). The activity at time $t$, denoted $A(t)$, is given by the radioactive decay law:\n$$\nA(t) = A_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\nwhere $A_0$ is the initial activity and $\\lambda$ is the decay constant. The decay constant is related to the half-life $t_{1/2}$ by $\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$.\nThe net administered activity, decay-corrected to the scan time $t$, is therefore:\n$$\nA_{\\text{net,t}} = A_{\\text{net,0}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} t\\right)\n$$\n\nThe denominator of the $SUV_{bw}$ formula is the \"concentration\" of the decay-corrected activity if it were uniformly distributed throughout the patient's body mass $W$.\n$$\n\\text{Denominator} = \\frac{A_{\\text{net,t}}}{W} = \\frac{A_{\\text{net,0}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} t\\right)}{W}\n$$\n\nThe numerator is the measured activity concentration in the lesion at the scan time, $C_t$. The problem asks for a dimensionless $SUV_{bw}$. To achieve this, the units of the numerator and denominator must be consistent. The standard convention is to express both in units of activity per unit mass (e.g., Bq/g).\n\nThe given tissue concentration is $C_t = 8$ kBq/ml.

The assumptions are scientifically grounded in enzyme kinetics and standard compartment modeling theory. All necessary parameters are provided for a unique solution.\n\nWe will address the four required tasks sequentially.\n\nFirst, we derive the dependence of the apparent transport parameter $K_1$ and phosphorylation parameter $k_3$ on the plasma glucose concentration, $[\\text{glc}]$. The problem states that both processes follow single-site saturable Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with native glucose acting as a competitive substrate.\n\nThe general rate equation for a substrate $S$ in the presence of a competitive inhibitor (or competing substrate) $I$ is:\n$$v = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_I}\\right) + [S]}$$\nwhere $K_I$ is the inhibition constant, which for a competing substrate is its own Michaelis constant, $K_m(I)$.\n\nFor the transport of FDG from plasma to tissue, FDG is the substrate and glucose is the competitor. Let $[\\text{FDG}]_p$ be the plasma FDG concentration and $[\\text{glc}]$ be the plasma glucose concentration. The transport velocity $v_{\\text{transport}}$ is:\n$$v_{\\text{transport}} = \\frac{V_{\\max, \\text{GLUT}}^{\\text{FDG}} [\\text{FDG}]_p}{K_{m, \\text{GLUT}}^{\\text{FDG}} \\left(1 + \\frac{[\\text{glc}]}{K_{m, \\text{GLUT}}^{\\text{glc}}}\\right) + [\\text{FDG}]_p}$$\nThe problem specifies that FDG is used in the tracer limit, meaning its concentration is negligible compared to its Michaelis-Menten constant: $[\\text{FDG}]_p \\ll K_{m, \\text{GLUT}}^{\\text{FDG}}$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$v_{\\text{transport}} \\approx \\frac{V_{\\max, \\text{GLUT}}^{\\text{FDG}} [\\text{FDG}]_p}{K_{m, \\text{GLUT}}^{\\text{FDG}} \\left(1 + \\frac{[\\text{glc}]}{K_{m, \\text{GLUT}}^{\\text{glc}}}\\right)}$$\nIn the compartment model, this velocity is defined as $v_{\\text{transport}} = K_1 [\\text{FDG}]_p$. By comparing the two expressions, we identify the apparent transport parameter $K_1$:\n$$K_1 = \\frac{V_{\\max, \\text{GLUT}}^{\\text{FDG}} / K_{m, \\text{GLUT}}^{\\text{FDG}}}{1 + \\frac{[\\text{glc}]}{K_{m, \\text{GLUT}}^{\\text{glc}}}}$$\nThis expression shows that $K_1$ is inversely related to the term $\\left(1 + \\frac{[\\text{glc}]}{K_{m, \\text{GLUT}}^{\\text{glc}}}\\right)$. As the plasma glucose concentration $[\\text{glc}]$ increases, the denominator increases, thereby reducing the value of the apparent transport parameter $K_1$.\n\nA precisely analogous derivation applies to the phosphorylation of intracellular FDG by hexokinase. Let $[\\text{FDG}]_e$ be the intracellular free FDG concentration. The phosphorylation velocity $v_{\\text{phos}}$ is:\n$$v_{\\text{phos}} = \\frac{V_{\\max, \\text{HK}}^{\\text{FDG}} [\\text{FDG}]_e}{K_{m, \\text{HK}}^{\\text{FDG}} \\left(1 + \\frac{[\\text{glc}]}{K_{m, \\text{HK}}^{\\text{glc}}}\\right) + [\\text{FDG}]_e}$$\nHere, we assume the relevant competing glucose concentration is reflected by the plasma value $[\\text{glc}]$. In the tracer limit, $[\\text{FDG}]_e \\ll K_{m, \\text{HK}}^{\\text{FDG}}$, so:\n$$v_{\\text{phos}} \\approx \\frac{V_{\\max, \\text{HK}}^{\\text{FDG}} [\\text{FDG}]_e}{K_{m, \\text{HK}}^{\\text{FDG}} \\left(1 + \\frac{[\\text{glc}]}{K_{m, \\text{HK}}^{\\text{glc}}}\\right)}$$\nThe compartment model defines this velocity as $v_{\\text{phos}} = k_3 [\\text{FDG}]_e$. Comparing these gives the apparent phosphorylation parameter $k_3$:\n$$k_3 = \\frac{V_{\\max, \\text{HK}}^{\\text{FDG}} / K_{m, \\text{HK}}^{\\text{FDG}}}{1 + \\frac{[\\text{glc}]}{K_{m, \\text{HK}}^{\\text{glc}}}}$$\nSimilar to $K_1$, as $[\\text{glc}]$ increases, the denominator increases, which causes a reduction in the apparent phosphorylation parameter $k_3$.\n\nSecond, we derive the net influx constant $K_i$. The irreversible two-compartment model for FDG describes the concentration of free FDG in tissue, $C_e(t)$, and phosphorylated FDG in tissue, $C_m(t)$, with the following differential equations, where $C_p(t)$ is the plasma FDG concentration:\n$$\\frac{dC_e}{dt} = K_1 C_p(t) - (k_2 + k_3) C_e(t)$$\n$$\\frac{dC_m}{dt} = k_3 C_e(t)$$\nThe problem states that the free FDG pool is in a quasi-steady-state (QSS), which means its rate of change is approximately zero, $\\frac{dC_e}{dt} \\approx 0$. Applying this to the first equation yields:\n$$0 \\approx K_1 C_p(t) - (k_2 + k_3) C_e(t) \\implies C_e(t) \\approx \\frac{K_1}{k_2 + k_3} C_p(t)$$\nThe net rate of accumulation of total tracer in tissue, $C_T(t) = C_e(t) + C_m(t)$, is $\\frac{dC_T}{dt} = \\frac{dC_e}{dt} + \\frac{dC_m}{dt}$. Under the QSS assumption, this simplifies to $\\frac{dC_T}{dt} \\approx \\frac{dC_m}{dt}$. Substituting the expressions for $\\frac{dC_m}{dt}$ and $C_e(t)$:\n$$\\frac{dC_T}{dt} \\approx k_3 C_e(t) \\approx k_3 \\left( \\frac{K_1}{k_2 + k_3} C_p(t) \\right)$$\nThe net influx constant $K_i$ is defined as the proportionality constant relating the rate of total tracer accumulation to the plasma concentration, $\\frac{dC_T}{dt} = K_i C_p(t)$. Therefore:\n$$K_i = \\frac{K_1 k_3}{k_2 + k_3}$$\n\nThird, we argue for the proportionality of the late-time Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) to $K_i$. The SUV is defined as the ratio of tissue activity concentration to the injected dose normalized by body mass. For a given time $t$:\n$$\\text{SUV}(t) = \\frac{\\text{Activity Concentration in Tissue}(t)}{\\text{Injected Dose} / \\text{Body Mass}} \\propto \\frac{C_T(t)}{D_{inj}}$$\nThe total tissue activity concentration $C_T(t)$ is found by integrating its rate of change: $C_T(t) = \\int_0^t \\frac{dC_T(\\tau)}{d\\tau} d\\tau$. Using the result from the QSS analysis:\n$$C_T(t) = \\int_0^t K_i C_p(\\tau) d\\tau = K_i \\int_0^t C_p(\\tau) d\\tau$$\nThe plasma concentration curve $C_p(t)$ describes the delivery of the tracer. The area under this curve, $\\int_0^t C_p(\\tau) d\\tau$, is proportional to the total injected dose $D_{inj}$, with the proportionality constant depending on systemic clearance and distribution volume. Under the specified condition of \"identical injected dose, body mass, and acquisition protocol,\" the relationship between the plasma AUC and the injected dose is the same for both studies. Therefore, we can write:\n$$\\text{SUV}(t) \\propto \\frac{K_i \\int_0^t C_p(\\tau) d\\tau}{D_{inj}} \\propto K_i$$\nAt late times, after the initial distribution phase, the irreversible trapping of FDG-6-phosphate becomes the dominant process reflected in the tissue activity, making this proportionality particularly robust. Since we have shown that $K_1$ and $k_3$, and consequently $K_i$, are functions of plasma glucose, it follows that the measured SUV is also dependent on glucose. This provides a direct mechanistic justification for applying a glucose correction to SUV measurements to account for metabolic variations.\n\nFourth, we compute the multiplicative correction factor $\\mathrm{CF}$ to estimate the SUV at normoglycemia ($[\\text{glc}]_{\\text{low}}$) from the measured SUV at hyperglycemia ($[\\text{glc}]_{\\text{high}}$).\n$$\\mathrm{CF} = \\frac{\\text{SUV}_{\\text{low}}}{\\text{SUV}_{\\text{high}}} = \\frac{K_{i, \\text{low}}}{K_{i, \\text{high}}}$$\nLet the low and high glucose concentrations be $G_L = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\cdot L^{-1}}$ and $G_H = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\cdot L^{-1}}$, respectively. We have:\n$$\\mathrm{CF} = \\frac{K_{1, \\text{low}} k_{3, \\text{low}} / (k_2 + k_{3, \\text{low}})}{K_{1, \\text{high}} k_{3, \\text{high}} / (k_2 + k_{3, \\text{high}})} = \\left(\\frac{K_{1, \\text{low}}}{K_{1, \\text{high}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{k_{3, \\text{low}}}{k_{3, \\text{high}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{k_2 + k_{3, \\text{high}}}{k_2 + k_{3, \\text{low}}}\\right)$$\nWe compute each ratio separately. For the $K_1$ ratio, using $K_{m,\\text{GLUT}}^{\\text{glc}} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\cdot L^{-1}}$:\n$$\\frac{K_{1, \\text{low}}}{K_{1, \\text{high}}} = \\frac{1 + G_H/K_{m,\\text{GLUT}}^{\\text{glc}}}{1 + G_L/K_{m,\\text{GLUT}}^{\\text{glc}}} = \\frac{1 + 10.0/3.0}{1 + 5.0/3.0} = \\frac{13/3}{8/3} = \\frac{13}{8}$$\nFor the $k_3$ ratio, using $K_{m,\\text{HK}}^{\\text{glc}} = 0.050\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\cdot L^{-1}}$:\n$$\\frac{k_{3, \\text{low}}}{k_{3, \\text{high}}} = \\frac{1 + G_H/K_{m,\\text{HK}}^{\\text{glc}}}{1 + G_L/K_{m,\\text{HK}}^{\\text{glc}}} = \\frac{1 + 10.0/0.050}{1 + 5.0/0.050} = \\frac{1 + 200}{1 + 100} = \\frac{201}{101}$$\nWe are given $k_{3, \\text{low}} = 0.050\\,\\mathrm{min^{-1}}$ and $k_2 = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{min^{-1}}$. We can find $k_{3, \\text{high}}$:\n$$k_{3, \\text{high}} = k_{3, \\text{low}} \\left(\\frac{k_{3, \\text{high}}}{k_{3, \\text{low}}}\\right) = 0.050 \\cdot \\frac{101}{201}\\,\\mathrm{min^{-1}}$$\nNow we compute the final ratio:\n$$\\frac{k_2 + k_{3, \\text{high}}}{k_2 + k_{3, \\text{low}}} = \\frac{0.20 + 0.050 \\cdot (101/201)}{0.20 + 0.050} = \\frac{0.20 \\cdot 201 + 0.050 \\cdot 101}{0.25 \\cdot 201} = \\frac{40.2 + 5.05}{50.25} = \\frac{45.25}{50.25} = \\frac{181}{201}$$\nCombining the three ratios to find the correction factor $\\mathrm{CF}$:\n$$\\mathrm{CF} = \\left(\\frac{13}{8}\\right) \\left(\\frac{201}{101}\\right) \\left(\\frac{181}{201}\\right) = \\frac{13}{8} \\cdot \\frac{181}{101} = \\frac{2353}{808}$$\nNumerically, this value is:\n$$\\mathrm{CF} \\approx 2.9121287...$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the correction factor is $2.91$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.91}$$", "id": "4869526"}]}
