The assumptions of linear PMT response and the connection between the estimator's homogeneity and energy independence are standard and correct in this context.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary information—the theoretical basis, PMT coordinates, and signal values—to derive the estimator and compute a unique position. The objectives are clearly stated.\n- **Objective:** The problem is phrased in precise, quantitative terms, free of subjective or ambiguous language.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The data are self-consistent. There are $9$ PMTs, $9$ coordinate pairs, and $9$ signal values. The coordinates match the description of a $3 \\times 3$ grid with $2\\,\\text{cm}$ spacing centered at the origin. The requirements are mutually consistent and lead to a standard, valid physical model.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. It is a valid problem in the field of medical imaging physics. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Event Position Estimator**\n\nThe problem requires that in the limit of dense sampling, the estimator for the event coordinates $(\\hat{x}, \\hat{y})$ must approach the centroid of the continuous light intensity distribution, $I(\\vec{r})$, where $\\vec{r}=(x,y)$. The coordinates of the centroid of a continuous distribution are given by:\n$$\n\\hat{x}_{\\text{cont}} = \\frac{\\int x I(x,y) \\,dx\\,dy}{\\int I(x,y) \\,dx\\,dy}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{y}_{\\text{cont}} = \\frac{\\int y I(x,y) \\,dx\\,dy}{\\int I(x,y) \\,dx\\,dy}\n$$\nThe detector array is discrete, consisting of $N$ PMTs. We can discretize these integrals by replacing them with sums over the PMT locations. The signal $V_k$ from the $k$-th PMT is stated to be linear in the local light intensity. We thus use $V_k$ as a weighting factor that is proportional to the light intensity sampled at the position $(x_k, y_k)$.\n\nThe denominator, $\\int I(x,y) \\,dx\\,dy$, represents the total light intensity, which is proportional to the total energy of the event. In the discrete approximation, this becomes the sum of all individual PMT signals, $\\sum_{k=1}^{N} V_k$.\n\nThe numerator for $\\hat{x}$, $\\int x I(x,y) \\,dx\\,dy$, is the first moment of the light distribution with respect to the $x$-axis. Its discrete counterpart is the weighted sum of the $x$-coordinates of the PMTs, where the weights are the signals: $\\sum_{k=1}^{N} x_k V_k$.\n\nSimilarly, the discrete approximation for the numerator of $\\hat{y}$ is $\\sum_{k=1}^{N} y_k V_k$.\n\nCombining these components yields the discrete estimator for the event coordinates, known as the Anger logic estimator:\n$$\n\\hat{x} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} x_k V_k}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} V_k} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\hat{y} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} y_k V_k}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} V_k}\n$$\nThis form satisfies the condition of being homogeneous of degree zero in $\\{V_k\\}$, which ensures energy independence, as will be explicitly verified later.\n\n**Calculation of Event Coordinates**\n\nWe are given $N=9$ PMTs. The coordinates $\\{(x_k, y_k)\\}$ and corresponding signals $\\{V_k\\}$ are provided. Let's list them systematically, indexing $k=1, \\dots, 9$ from top-left to bottom-right:\n1. $(x_1, y_1) = (-2, 2)$, $V_1 = 4$\n2. $(x_2, y_2) = (0, 2)$, $V_2 = 8$\n3. $(x_3, y_3) = (2, 2)$, $V_3 = 12$\n4. $(x_4, y_4) = (-2, 0)$, $V_4 = 6$\n5. $(x_5, y_5) = (0, 0)$, $V_5 = 10$\n6. $(x_6, y_6) = (2, 0)$, $V_6 = 14$\n7. $(x_7, y_7) = (-2, -2)$, $V_7 = 8$\n8. $(x_8, y_8) = (0, -2)$, $V_8 = 12$\n9. $(x_9, y_9) = (2, -2)$, $V_9 = 16$\n\nFirst, we compute the sum of the signals (the denominator):\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{9} V_k = 4 + 8 + 12 + 6 + 10 + 14 + 8 + 12 + 16 = 90\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the weighted sum of the $x$-coordinates (the numerator for $\\hat{x}$):\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{9} x_k V_k = (-2)(4) + (0)(8) + (2)(12) + (-2)(6) + (0)(10) + (2)(14) + (-2)(8) + (0)(12) + (2)(16)\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{9} x_k V_k = -8 + 0 + 24 - 12 + 0 + 28 - 16 + 0 + 32 = 48\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the estimated $x$-coordinate:\n$$\n\\hat{x} = \\frac{\\sum x_k V_k}{\\sum V_k} = \\frac{48}{90} = \\frac{8 \\times 6}{15 \\times 6} = \\frac{8}{15}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the weighted sum of the $y$-coordinates (the numerator for $\\hat{y}$):\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{9} y_k V_k = (2)(4) + (2)(8) + (2)(12) + (0)(6) + (0)(10) + (0)(14) + (-2)(8) + (-2)(12) + (-2)(16)\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{9} y_k V_k = 8 + 16 + 24 + 0 + 0 + 0 - 16 - 24 - 32 = 8 - 32 = -24\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the estimated $y$-coordinate:\n$$\n\\hat{y} = \\frac{\\sum y_k V_k}{\\sum V_k} = \\frac{-24}{90} = \\frac{-4 \\times 6}{15 \\times 6} = -\\frac{4}{15}\n$$\nThe calculated event coordinates are $(\\hat{x}, \\hat{y}) = (\\frac{8}{15}, -\\frac{4}{15})$. The units are inherited from the PMT position units, which are $\\text{cm}$.\n\n**Verification of Energy Independence**\n\nThe problem requires verification that the estimator is invariant under a uniform scaling of signals. This corresponds to the property of being homogeneous of degree zero. Let the signals be scaled by a positive constant $\\alpha > 0$, representing a different event energy, such that the new signals are $V'_k = \\alpha V_k$. We compute the new position estimate $(\\hat{x}', \\hat{y}')$:\n$$\n\\hat{x}' = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} x_k V'_k}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} V'_k} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} x_k (\\alpha V_k)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} (\\alpha V_k)} = \\frac{\\alpha \\sum_{k=1}^{N} x_k V_k}{\\alpha \\sum_{k=1}^{N} V_k} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} x_k V_k}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} V_k} = \\hat{x}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{y}' = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} y_k V'_k}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} V'_k} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} y_k (\\alpha V_k)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} (\\alpha V_k)} = \\frac{\\alpha \\sum_{k=1}^{N} y_k V_k}{\\alpha \\sum_{k=1}^{N} V_k} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} y_k V_k}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} V_k} = \\hat{y}\n$$\nSince $(\\hat{x}', \\hat{y}') = (\\hat{x}, \\hat{y})$, the estimated position is independent of the scaling factor $\\alpha$.

The analysis will be performed in three parts as requested.\n\nThe unperturbed Anger logic position estimate is defined as:\n$$\n\\hat{x} \\equiv \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} x_k V_k}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} V_k}\n$$\nwhere $\\{x_k\\}_{k=1}^{N}$ are the known detector positions and $\\{V_k\\}_{k=1}^{N}$ are the measured nonnegative signals.\n\n**Part 1: Transformation under Uniform Multiplicative Gain**\n\nWe are given a uniform multiplicative gain factor $g > 0$ applied to every channel, resulting in perturbed signals $V_k^{(g)} = g V_k$. The new position estimate, $\\hat{x}^{(g)}$, is calculated using these perturbed signals:\n$$\n\\hat{x}^{(g)} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} x_k V_k^{(g)}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} V_k^{(g)}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $V_k^{(g)}$:\n$$\n\\hat{x}^{(g)} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} x_k (g V_k)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} (g V_k)}\n$$\nSince $g$ is a constant factor that is identical for all channels, it can be factored out of the summations in both the numerator and the denominator:\n$$\n\\hat{x}^{(g)} = \\frac{g \\sum_{k=1}^{N} x_k V_k}{g \\sum_{k=1}^{N} V_k}\n$$\nGiven that $g>0$, the factor $g$ in the numerator and denominator can be cancelled:\n$$\n\\hat{x}^{(g)} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} x_k V_k}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} V_k} = \\hat{x}\n$$\nThe centroid estimate $\\hat{x}^{(g)}$ is identical to the unperturbed estimate $\\hat{x}$. This demonstrates that the Anger logic centroid estimator is not merely less sensitive to uniform multiplicative gain errors; it is completely **invariant** to them. This property is a significant advantage of ratiometric calculations like the centroid, as it eliminates the need for precise, stable gain calibration across all detector channels, provided the gain is uniform.\n\n**Part 2: Transformation under Constant Additive Baseline Offset**\n\nNext, we consider a constant additive baseline offset $b$ applied to every channel, yielding perturbed signals $V_k^{(b)} = V_k + b$. The new position estimate, $\\hat{x}^{(b)}$, is:\n$$\n\\hat{x}^{(b)} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} x_k V_k^{(b)}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} V_k^{(b)}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $V_k^{(b)}$:\n$$\n\\hat{x}^{(b)} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} x_k (V_k + b)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} (V_k + b)}\n$$\nWe expand the summations in the numerator and the denominator by distributing the terms:\n$$\n\\hat{x}^{(b)} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} x_k V_k + \\sum_{k=1}^{N} x_k b}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} V_k + \\sum_{k=1}^{N} b}\n$$\nThe constant $b$ can be factored out of the sums where it appears.

The presence of the offset $b$ alters the value of the estimate. Therefore, the centroid estimate is **biased** by a constant additive baseline offset. This bias systematically shifts the estimated position.\n\n**Part 3: Derivation of the Bias Expression**\n\nThe induced bias is defined as $\\Delta x \\equiv \\hat{x}^{(b)} - \\hat{x}$. To derive a closed-form expression for $\\Delta x$, we use the result from Part 2 and the definitions provided in the problem statement:\n- Total unperturbed signal: $S_0 \\equiv \\sum_{k=1}^{N} V_k$.\n- Arithmetic mean of detector positions: $\\bar{x} \\equiv \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{k=1}^{N} x_k$, which implies $\\sum_{k=1}^{N} x_k = N\\bar{x}$.\n- From the definition of $\\hat{x}$, we have $\\sum_{k=1}^{N} x_k V_k = \\hat{x} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} V_k = \\hat{x} S_0$.\n\nWe can rewrite the expression for $\\hat{x}^{(b)}$ using these definitions:\n$$\n\\hat{x}^{(b)} = \\frac{\\hat{x} S_0 + b (N \\bar{x})}{S_0 + N b}\n$$\nWe assume that the denominator $S_0 + N b \\neq 0$ for the estimate to be well-defined.
