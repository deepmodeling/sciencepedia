The CDR reflects a combination of geometric blur introduced by the collimator and intrinsic blur due to the detector.

Let the geometric blur at distance $z$, measured by its full width at half maximum (FWHM), be described empirically for a parallel-hole collimator as $\\mathrm{FWHM}_{g}(z) = \\alpha z + \\beta$, where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are constants determined by the collimator geometry and $\\mathrm{FWHM}_{g}$ is in $\\mathrm{mm}$ when $z$ is in $\\mathrm{cm}$.

It also asks for a qualitative discussion of acquisition choices affecting the source-to-collimator distance.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement. The givens are:\n1.  The total image blur, represented by the CDR, is the convolution of two independent blurring kernels: a geometric blur and an intrinsic blur.\n2.  Both blurring kernels are approximated by Gaussian point spread functions (PSFs).\n3.  The geometric blur's full width at half maximum (FWHM) is given by $\\mathrm{FWHM}_{g}(z) = \\alpha z + \\beta$, where $z$ is the source-to-collimator distance.\n4.

The linear model for geometric blur is a widely used and validated empirical relationship for parallel-hole collimators. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary information provided for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is valid and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is derived from the properties of the convolution of Gaussian functions. The convolution of two Gaussian functions results in a third Gaussian function. A critical property is that if the two underlying random variables are independent, the variance of the resulting distribution is the sum of the individual variances. The problem states that the geometric and intrinsic blur components are independent.

The primary SPECT acquisition choice that directly modulates $z$ is the **radius of rotation (ROR)** of the detector gantry. The goal is to keep the detector as close to the patient as possible throughout the entire scan to minimize $z$.\nThis introduces a critical trade-off:\n1.  **Spatial Resolution vs. Practicality/Safety**:\n    *   A **smaller ROR** (minimizing $z$) leads to a smaller geometric blur component ($\\mathrm{FWHM}_{g}$), as it is linearly dependent on $z$. This directly improves the overall spatial resolution of the final reconstructed image, allowing for better visualization of small structures.\n    *   However, setting the ROR too small increases the risk of collision between the gantry and the patient, especially if the patient moves. It can also cause anxiety in claustrophobic patients. To optimize this, modern systems often use **non-circular (e.g., body-contouring) orbits** that dynamically adjust the detector's distance to follow the patient's body shape, minimizing $z$ at each projection angle more effectively than a simple circular orbit.\n    *   A **larger ROR** is safer, more comfortable for the patient, and easier for the technologist to set up, but it comes at the direct cost of degraded spatial resolution due to increased geometric blurring.\nTherefore, the fundamental trade-off is between achieving the highest possible spatial resolution and ensuring patient safety, comfort, and the practical feasibility of the scan.

The injected activity is $A = 740 \\, \\text{MBq} = 7.40 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$. The emission yield is $y = 0.89$, and the baseline sensitivity is $S_0 = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}$. The baseline pre-dead-time (true) count rate is:\n$$R_{\\text{true},0} = y A S_{0} = (0.89)(7.40 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{s}^{-1})(1.2 \\times 10^{-3}) = 790320 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$$\n$$R_{\\text{true},0} = 7.9032 \\times 10^5 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$$\nThe system dead-time is $\\tau = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{s}$. The product $R_{\\text{true},0} \\tau$ is a dimensionless quantity:\n$$R_{\\text{true},0} \\tau = (7.9032 \\times 10^5 \\, \\text{s}^{-1})(1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{s}) = 0.79032$$\nThe baseline observed count rate, $R_{\\text{obs},0}$, is:\n$$R_{\\text{obs},0} = \\frac{R_{\\text{true},0}}{1 + R_{\\text{true},0} \\tau} = \\frac{7.9032 \\times 10^5 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}}{1 + 0.79032} = \\frac{7.9032 \\times 10^5 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}}{1.79032} \\approx 4.4144 \\times 10^5 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$$\nThe baseline fractional loss of counts, $L_0$, is the ratio of lost counts to true counts:\n$$L_0 = \\frac{R_{\\text{true},0} - R_{\\text{obs},0}}{R_{\\text{true},0}} = 1 - \\frac{R_{\\text{obs},0}}{R_{\\text{true},0}} = 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + R_{\\text{true},0}\\tau} = \\frac{R_{\\text{true},0}\\tau}{1 + R_{\\text{true},0}\\tau}$$\n$$L_0 = \\frac{0.79032}{1.79032} \\approx 0.44144$$\nThis represents a loss of approximately $44.1\\%$.\n\nThe main task is to find the minimal scaling factor $s$ such that the observed rate $R_{\\text{obs}}(s)$ does not exceed the limit $R_{\\text{lim}} = 2.50 \\times 10^5 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$. The scaled true rate is $R_{\\text{true}}(s) = s \\, R_{\\text{true},0}$. The corresponding observed rate is:\n$$R_{\\text{obs}}(s) = \\frac{s \\, R_{\\text{true},0}}{1 + s \\, R_{\\text{true},0} \\tau}$$\nThe derivative $\\frac{dR_{\\text{obs}}}{ds} = \\frac{R_{\\text{true},0}}{(1 + s R_{\\text{true},0} \\tau)^2}$ is always positive, so $R_{\\text{obs}}(s)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $s$. The condition is $R_{\\text{obs}}(s) \\le R_{\\text{lim}}$. Since the baseline observed rate $R_{\\text{obs},0} \\approx 4.41 \\times 10^5 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$ exceeds $R_{\\text{lim}}$, we must reduce the true rate, implying $s<1$. The set of solutions for $s$ that satisfy the inequality is an interval $[0, s_{\\text{max}}]$, where $s_{\\text{max}}$ is the value of $s$ for which $R_{\\text{obs}}(s_{\\text{max}}) = R_{\\text{lim}}$. A literal interpretation of \"minimal $s$\" would yield the trivial answer $s=0$. In the context of the problem—finding the necessary scaling to bring the system from an overloaded state into an acceptable operating range—the physically meaningful quantity to find is the boundary value $s_{\\text{max}}$. This value corresponds to the least amount of count rate reduction required to meet the specification. We therefore solve the equality:\n$$R_{\\text{lim}} = \\frac{s \\, R_{\\text{true},0}}{1 + s \\, R_{\\text{true},0} \\tau}$$\nWe now solve for $s$:\n$$R_{\\text{lim}} (1 + s \\, R_{\\text{true},0} \\tau) = s \\, R_{\\text{true},0}$$\n$$R_{\\text{lim}} = s \\, R_{\\text{true},0} - s \\, R_{\\text{lim}} R_{\\text{true},0} \\tau$$\n$$R_{\\text{lim}} = s (R_{\\text{true},0} - R_{\\text{lim}} R_{\\text{true},0} \\tau)$$\n$$R_{\\text{lim}} = s \\, R_{\\text{true},0} (1 - R_{\\text{lim}} \\tau)$$\n$$s = \\frac{R_{\\text{lim}}}{R_{\\text{true},0}(1 - R_{\\text{lim}} \\tau)}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$$R_{\\text{lim}} = 2.50 \\times 10^5 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$$\n$$R_{\\text{true},0} = 7.9032 \\times 10^5 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$$\n$$\\tau = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{s}$$\nFirst, compute the term $(1 - R_{\\text{lim}} \\tau)$:\n$$1 - R_{\\text{lim}} \\tau = 1 - (2.50 \\times 10^5 \\, \\text{s}^{-1})(1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{s}) = 1 - 0.250 = 0.750$$\nNow, substitute this into the expression for $s$:\n$$s = \\frac{2.50 \\times 10^5}{ (7.9032 \\times 10^5)(0.750) } = \\frac{2.50}{7.9032 \\times 0.750} = \\frac{2.50}{5.9274}$$\n$$s \\approx 0.4217600$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the minimal required scaling factor is $0.4218$. This means the true count rate must be reduced to approximately $42.18\\%$ of its baseline value to bring the observed count rate down to the specified limit. This reduction can be achieved by, for example, narrowing the energy window from its initial width $w_0$ to $w = 0.4218 \\, w_0$ (i.e. from $20\\%$ of photopeak to about $8.44\\%$), or by increasing the source-to-detector distance from $d_0=0.15 \\, \\text{m}$ to $d = d_0/\\sqrt{s} = 0.15/\\sqrt{0.4218} \\approx 0.231 \\, \\text{m}$, or a combination of both strategies.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4218}$$", "id": "4926946"}]}
