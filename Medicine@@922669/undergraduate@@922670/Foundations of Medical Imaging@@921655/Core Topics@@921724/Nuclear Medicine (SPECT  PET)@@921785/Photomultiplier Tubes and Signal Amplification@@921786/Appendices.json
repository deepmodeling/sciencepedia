It is scientifically grounded in the principles of quantum mechanics (specifically, the photoelectric effect), well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objective in its formulation. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part response: first, the derivation of an expression for the maximum kinetic energy of a photoelectron; second, a numerical evaluation of this energy for the given parameters; and third, a discussion of the implications for photocathode material selection.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Expression for Maximum Kinetic Energy**\n\nThe process begins with the fundamental Planck-Einstein relation, which quantifies the energy of a single photon, $E_{photon}$, as a function of its frequency, $\\nu$:\n$$E_{photon} = h\\nu$$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant.\n\nThe frequency $\\nu$ of an electromagnetic wave is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ and the speed of light in vacuum $c$ by the wave equation:\n$$c = \\lambda\\nu \\quad \\implies \\quad \\nu = \\frac{c}{\\lambda}$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\nu$ into the Planck-Einstein relation yields the photon energy in terms of its wavelength:\n$$E_{photon} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$$\n\nThe photoelectric effect describes the emission of electrons from a material upon the absorption of electromagnetic radiation. The principle of energy conservation governs this interaction. An incident photon's energy, $E_{photon}$, is transferred to an electron. A minimum amount of this energy, known as the work function $\\phi$, is required to overcome the binding forces and liberate the electron from the material's surface. Any excess energy is converted into the kinetic energy, $K$, of the photoelectron. The *maximum* kinetic energy, $K_{max}$, corresponds to the case where an electron at the very surface is ejected and loses no additional energy through scattering within the material.\n\nThe energy conservation equation for this process is therefore:\n$$E_{photon} = \\phi + K_{max}$$\n\nSolving for $K_{max}$ gives:\n$$K_{max} = E_{photon} - \\phi$$\n\nBy substituting the expression for $E_{photon}$ derived earlier, we arrive at the final expression for the maximum initial kinetic energy of the photoelectron as a function of the incident photon's wavelength and the material's work function:\n$$K_{max} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} - \\phi$$\nThis is the required analytical expression.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are tasked with evaluating $K_{max}$ for the given parameters:\n- Wavelength: $\\lambda = 500\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 500 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Work function: $\\phi = 2.10\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- Planck's constant: $h = 6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}$\n- Speed of light: $c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n- Charge of an electron (for eV conversion): $e \\approx 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$, so $1\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy of a single scintillation photon, $E_{photon}$, in SI units (Joules):\n$$E_{photon} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} = \\frac{(6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}) \\times (2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{m/s})}{500 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}}$$\n$$E_{photon} \\approx 3.97289172 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\n\nNext, we convert this energy from Joules to electronvolts (eV) for consistency with the given work function:\n$$E_{photon} (\\mathrm{eV}) = \\frac{3.97289172 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J}}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J/eV}} \\approx 2.47968\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\n\nNow we can calculate the maximum kinetic energy, $K_{max}$, using the derived formula:\n$$K_{max} = E_{photon} - \\phi$$\n$$K_{max} \\approx 2.47968\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 2.10\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 0.37968\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final result to four significant figures.\n$$K_{max} \\approx 0.3797\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\n\n**Part 3: Implications for Photocathode Material Selection**\n\nThe derived relation, $K_{max} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} - \\phi$, provides critical constraints on the selection of photocathode materials for specific applications.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Requirement for Photoemission**: For a photoelectron to be emitted, its kinetic energy must be non-negative, i.e., $K_{max} \\ge 0$. This directly implies the condition $\\frac{hc}{\\lambda} - \\phi \\ge 0$, which can be rearranged to:\n    $$\\phi \\le \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$$\n    The work function $\\phi$ of the photocathode material must be less than or equal to the energy of the incident photons. For the given blue-green scintillation light with $\\lambda = 500\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, the photon energy is $E_{photon} \\approx 2.48\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. Therefore, any material with a work function $\\phi > 2.48\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ will be completely insensitive to these photons and cannot be used. This establishes a strict upper limit on the allowable range of $\\phi$.\n\n2.  **Implications for Quantum Efficiency (QE)**: Quantum Efficiency (QE) is the probability that an incident photon will produce a detectable photoelectron. For a given wavelength $\\lambda$, the QE is strongly dependent on the work function $\\phi$. A larger energy difference, $(E_{photon} - \\phi)$, corresponds to a larger value of $K_{max}$. This 'excess energy' allows electrons excited deeper within the material, which may lose some energy traveling to the surface, to still have sufficient energy to escape. Consequently, a lower work function $\\phi$ (and thus a higher $K_{max}$) generally leads to a higher QE, as it increases the effective volume from which photoelectrons can be successfully emitted. If $\\phi$ is very close to $E_{photon}$, only electrons at the immediate surface can escape, resulting in a very low QE. To maximize sensitivity to $500\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ light, one would ideally select a material with $\\phi$ significantly below $2.48\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\n3.  **Trade-off with Dark Current**: While a low work function is desirable for high QE, it also increases the rate of thermionic emission (dark current). Electrons can be liberated by thermal energy alone, creating a noise signal even in the absence of light. The rate of thermionic emission is highly sensitive to both temperature and the work function. A very low $\\phi$ can lead to an unacceptably high dark current, which degrades the signal-to-noise ratio, a critical parameter in low-light medical imaging applications. Therefore, the selection of a photocathode material involves a critical trade-off: $\\phi$ must be low enough for good QE at the target wavelength but high enough to maintain an acceptably low dark current at the operating temperature. The given value of $\\phi = 2.10\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ for $\\lambda = 500\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ represents a practical compromise for many common photocathode types (e.g., bialkali antimonides).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.3797}\n$$", "id": "4910733"}, {"introduction": "Once a photoelectron is created, it is amplified by a factor of millions through a cascade of secondary emissions at the dynodes.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Mean Anode Charge $\\mathbb{E}[Q_{N}]$**\n\nThe mean anode charge is related to the mean number of electrons after $N$ stages, $\\mathbb{E}[Z_{N}]$, by the linearity of the expectation operator:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Q_{N}] = \\mathbb{E}[e\\,Z_{N}] = e\\,\\mathbb{E}[Z_{N}]\n$$\nTo find $\\mathbb{E}[Z_{N}]$, we establish a recursive relationship for $\\mathbb{E}[Z_{k}]$ for $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$. The number of electrons after stage $k$, $Z_{k}$, is the sum of the secondary electrons produced by each of the $Z_{k-1}$ electrons incident on the $k$-th dynode. Let $X_{k,i}$ be the random number of secondary electrons produced by the $i$-th electron at stage $k$, for $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, Z_{k-1}\\}$. Then we can write:\n$$\nZ_{k} = \\sum_{i=1}^{Z_{k-1}} X_{k,i}\n$$\nThe variables $X_{k,i}$ are i.i.d. with mean $\\delta$ and variance $\\sigma^2$. We use the law of total expectation (also known as the tower rule): $\\mathbb{E}[Y] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[Y|W]]$. Let $Y=Z_k$ and $W=Z_{k-1}$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Z_{k}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbb{E}[Z_{k} | Z_{k-1}]\\right]\n$$\nFirst, we compute the inner conditional expectation. Given that $Z_{k-1}$ takes a specific value $z_{k-1}$, the conditional expectation of $Z_k$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Z_{k} | Z_{k-1}=z_{k-1}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{z_{k-1}} X_{k,i}\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{z_{k-1}} \\mathbb{E}[X_{k,i}] = z_{k-1}\\delta\n$$\nThis implies that the conditional expectation as a random variable is $\\mathbb{E}[Z_{k} | Z_{k-1}] = Z_{k-1}\\delta$.\nNow, we take the outer expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Z_{k}] = \\mathbb{E}[Z_{k-1}\\delta] = \\delta\\,\\mathbb{E}[Z_{k-1}]\n$$\nThis is a geometric recurrence relation. With the initial condition $Z_{0}=1$, we have $\\mathbb{E}[Z_{0}]=1$.

Taking the expectation gives the first term:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(Z_k | Z_{k-1})] = \\mathbb{E}[Z_{k-1}\\sigma^2] = \\sigma^2\\,\\mathbb{E}[Z_{k-1}] = \\sigma^2\\delta^{k-1}\n$$\nFor the second term, we use the conditional expectation derived earlier, $\\mathbb{E}[Z_k | Z_{k-1}] = Z_{k-1}\\delta$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[Z_k | Z_{k-1}]) = \\operatorname{Var}(Z_{k-1}\\delta) = \\delta^2\\,\\operatorname{Var}(Z_{k-1})\n$$\nCombining the two terms, we obtain a recurrence relation for $v_k = \\operatorname{Var}(Z_k)$:\n$$\nv_k = \\delta^2 v_{k-1} + \\sigma^2 \\delta^{k-1}\n$$\nThe initial condition is $v_0 = \\operatorname{Var}(Z_0) = \\operatorname{Var}(1) = 0$.

The costs of misclassification are assumed to be equal.\nAn error occurs if we decide $H_0$ when $H_1$ is true (occurs with probability $p_1$), or if we decide $H_1$ when $H_0$ is true (occurs with probability $p_0$).\nThe decision rule is: if $A \\gt T$, decide $H_1$; if $A \\le T$, decide $H_0$.\n$P(\\text{decide } H_0 | H_1) = P(A \\le T | H_1) = 1 - \\eta(T)$.\n$P(\\text{decide } H_1 | H_0) = P(A \\gt T | H_0) = \\alpha(T)$.\nThe average error probability is:\n$$P_e(T) = p_1 P(\\text{decide } H_0 | H_1) + p_0 P(\\text{decide } H_1 | H_0) = p_1(1-\\eta(T)) + p_0\\alpha(T)$$\nTo find the minimum, we differentiate $P_e(T)$ with respect to $T$ and set the result to zero.
