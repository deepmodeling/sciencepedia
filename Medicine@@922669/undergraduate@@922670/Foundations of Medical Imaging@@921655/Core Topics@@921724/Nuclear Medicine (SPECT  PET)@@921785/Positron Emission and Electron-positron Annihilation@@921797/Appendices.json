It presents a standard problem in nuclear physics concerning the energetics of beta decay, which is relevant to the foundations of medical imaging. The provided data and assumptions are physically consistent and sufficient for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for an analysis of two potential decay modes for a hypothetical neutral atom $X(Z,A)$ decaying to its isobaric daughter $Y(Z-1,A)$. The given atomic mass difference is $M(X) - M(Y) = 1.1 \\, m_e$, where $m_e$ is the rest mass of an electron. We will analyze positron emission ($\\beta^+$) and electron capture ($EC$) separately.\n\n**Part 1: Analysis of Positron Emission ($\\beta^+$ Decay)**\n\nThe nuclear reaction for positron emission is:\n$$\n{}_{Z}^{A}X_{\\text{nucleus}} \\rightarrow {}_{Z-1}^{A}Y_{\\text{nucleus}} + e^+ + \\nu_e\n$$\nHere, a proton within the nucleus of $X$ is converted into a neutron, a positron ($e^+$), and an electron neutrino ($\\nu_e$). For this decay to be energetically possible, the total energy released, known as the $Q$-value ($Q_{\\beta^+}$), must be positive. The $Q$-value is the difference between the initial rest mass-energy and the final rest mass-energy. Assuming the neutrino is massless, the $Q$-value in terms of nuclear masses ($M_{nuc}$) is:\n$$\nQ_{\\beta^+} = \\left[ M_{nuc}(Z,A) - M_{nuc}(Z-1,A) - m_e \\right] c^2\n$$\nThe problem provides the mass difference between neutral atoms, not bare nuclei. The mass of a neutral atom, $M_{atom}$, can be related to its nuclear mass by approximating it as the sum of the nuclear mass and the mass of its orbital electrons, neglecting the total electron binding energy as instructed. For a neutral atom with atomic number $Z$, this is $M_{atom}(Z) \\approx M_{nuc}(Z) + Z m_e$.\n\nUsing this approximation, we can express the nuclear masses in terms of the given atomic masses, $M(X)$ and $M(Y)$:\n$$\nM_{nuc}(Z,A) \\approx M(X) - Z m_e\n$$\n$$\nM_{nuc}(Z-1,A) \\approx M(Y) - (Z-1) m_e\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $Q_{\\beta^+}$:\n$$\nQ_{\\beta^+} \\approx \\left[ (M(X) - Z m_e) - (M(Y) - (Z-1) m_e) - m_e \\right] c^2\n$$\n$$\nQ_{\\beta^+} \\approx \\left[ M(X) - M(Y) - Z m_e + (Z-1) m_e - m_e \\right] c^2\n$$\n$$\nQ_{\\beta^+} \\approx \\left[ M(X) - M(Y) - Z m_e + Z m_e - m_e - m_e \\right] c^2\n$$\n$$\nQ_{\\beta^+} = \\left[ M(X) - M(Y) - 2m_e \\right] c^2\n$$\nThis is the standard condition for positron emission in terms of atomic masses. The atomic mass of the parent must exceed the atomic mass of the daughter by at least two electron masses ($2m_e$).\n\nUsing the given data, $M(X) - M(Y) = 1.1 \\, m_e$:\n$$\nQ_{\\beta^+} = \\left[ 1.1 \\, m_e - 2m_e \\right] c^2 = -0.9 \\, m_e c^2\n$$\nSince $Q_{\\beta^+}  0$, the process requires an input of energy. Therefore, positron emission ($\\beta^+$ decay) is energetically forbidden for this nuclide. This means it cannot be used as a positron source for PET imaging.\n\n**Part 2: Analysis of Electron Capture ($EC$)**\n\nThe nuclear reaction for electron capture is:\n$$\n{}_{Z}^{A}X_{\\text{nucleus}} + e^-_{\\text{bound}} \\rightarrow {}_{Z-1}^{A}Y_{\\text{nucleus}} + \\nu_e\n$$\nHere, the nucleus captures one of its own orbital electrons (typically from an inner shell like the K or L shell), and a proton is converted into a neutron, emitting an electron neutrino.\n\nThe total energy release for this process, $Q_{EC}$, is defined as the difference between the mass-energy of the initial neutral atom $X$ and the final neutral atom $Y$.\n$$\nQ_{EC} = \\left[ M(X) - M(Y) \\right] c^2\n$$\nThis total energy is partitioned among the decay products. To see this, let's analyze the energy balance more closely. The initial energy is that of the neutral atom $X$, which is $M(X)c^2$. The final state consists of a neutral atom $Y$ (with mass $M(Y)$), an emitted neutrino, and the energy released from atomic relaxation.\n\nThe energy available to the primary nuclear transition products (the recoiling daughter nucleus and the neutrino) is not the full $Q_{EC}$. The captured electron was bound to the parent atom with a certain binding energy, say $E_b > 0$. The energy conservation for the transition itself is:\n$$\nM_{nuc}(X)c^2 + (m_ec^2 - E_b) = M_{nuc}(Y)c^2 + E_{\\nu} + E_{recoil}\n$$\nNeglecting the recoil energy of the daughter nucleus ($E_{recoil} \\approx 0$), the neutrino carries away an energy $E_{\\nu}$:\n$$\nE_{\\nu} \\approx \\left[ M_{nuc}(X) + m_e - M_{nuc}(Y) \\right] c^2 - E_b\n$$\nExpressing this in terms of atomic masses:\n$$\nE_{\\nu} \\approx \\left[ (M(X) - Zm_e) + m_e - (M(Y) - (Z-1)m_e) \\right] c^2 - E_b\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\nu} \\approx \\left[ M(X) - M(Y) - Zm_e + m_e + Zm_e - m_e \\right] c^2 - E_b\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\nu} = \\left[ M(X) - M(Y) \\right] c^2 - E_b = Q_{EC} - E_b\n$$\nAfter the capture, the daughter atom $Y$ is left with a vacancy in an inner electron shell. This excited atomic state relaxes by emitting characteristic X-rays or Auger electrons, releasing a total energy $E_{relax}$ exactly equal to the binding energy $E_b$ of the captured electron.\n\nThe total energy released to all final state products is the sum of the neutrino energy and the atomic relaxation energy:\n$$\nE_{total} = E_{\\nu} + E_{relax} = (Q_{EC} - E_b) + E_b = Q_{EC}\n$$\nThus, the \"total energy release available to electron capture final states\" is precisely $Q_{EC} = (M(X) - M(Y))c^2$.\n\nWith the given data, $M(X) - M(Y) = 1.1 \\, m_e$, this energy is:\n$$\nQ_{EC} = 1.1 \\, m_e c^2\n$$\nUsing the provided numerical value $m_e c^2 = 510.999 \\, \\text{keV}$:\n$$\nQ_{EC} = 1.1 \\times 510.999 \\, \\text{keV} = 562.0989 \\, \\text{keV}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nQ_{EC} \\approx 562.1 \\, \\text{keV}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{562.1}\n$$", "id": "4912741"}, {"introduction": "Once a positron annihilates with an electron, it produces the two photons that PET scanners are designed to detect.

It is based on established principles of positron-electron annihilation and the geometry of a PET scanner. It provides sufficient information to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe objective is to derive the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the transaxial point spread function (PSF) contribution from photon non-collinearity in a PET system of diameter $D$.\n\nLet the PET scanner be modeled as a cylindrical ring of detectors with diameter $D$ and radius $R = D/2$. We consider an electron-positron annihilation event occurring at the center of the scanner, which we set as the origin $O=(0,0)$ of a Cartesian coordinate system. This position corresponds to the worst-case scenario for this blurring effect, as it provides the longest lever arm for the angular error to translate into spatial error.\n\nIn an ideal annihilation, two photons of energy $511 \\, \\text{keV}$ would be emitted in exactly opposite directions ($180^\\circ$ apart). However, due to the residual momentum of the electron-positron pair, their paths deviate from a straight line by a small acollinearity angle, $\\varepsilon$. The total angle between the two photon paths is $\\pi - \\varepsilon$ radians.\n\nThe two photons are detected at points $P_1$ and $P_2$ on the detector ring. The paths are $OP_1$ and $OP_2$, so the angle between the paths is $\\angle P_1 O P_2 = \\pi - \\varepsilon$. The LOR is the line segment $P_1 P_2$. The positional error, $r_{err}$, is the perpendicular distance from the origin $O$ to the LOR.\n\nConsider the triangle $\\triangle OP_1 P_2$. It is an isosceles triangle with two sides of length $R$. The base angles are each $(\\pi - (\\pi - \\varepsilon))/2 = \\varepsilon/2$.\n\nLet's calculate the distance directly. The distance from the center $O$ to the chord $P_1 P_2$ of length $|P_1 P_2|$ in a circle of radius $R$ is given by $r_{err} = \\sqrt{R^2 - (|P_1 P_2|/2)^2}$. Using the law of cosines in $\\triangle OP_1 P_2$:\n$$|P_1 P_2|^2 = R^2 + R^2 - 2R^2\\cos(\\pi - \\varepsilon) = 2R^2(1 + \\cos\\varepsilon)$$\nUsing the half-angle identity $1+\\cos\\varepsilon = 2\\cos^2(\\varepsilon/2)$:\n$$|P_1 P_2|^2 = 4R^2\\cos^2(\\varepsilon/2) \\implies |P_1 P_2| = 2R\\cos(\\varepsilon/2)$$\nSubstituting this into the distance formula:\n$$r_{err} = \\sqrt{R^2 - (R\\cos(\\varepsilon/2))^2} = \\sqrt{R^2(1-\\cos^2(\\varepsilon/2))} = \\sqrt{R^2\\sin^2(\\varepsilon/2)} = R\\sin(\\varepsilon/2)$$\nSince $R = D/2$, the positional error is:\n$$r_{err} = \\frac{D}{2} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}\\right)$$\nThe problem specifies using a small-angle approximation, which is appropriate as $\\varepsilon$ is very small.

Therefore:\n$$r_{err} \\approx \\frac{D}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}\\right) = \\frac{D\\varepsilon}{4}$$\nHere, $\\varepsilon$ must be in radians.\n\nThe problem states that the acollinearity angle $\\varepsilon$ is a zero-mean Gaussian random variable. The positional error $r_{err}$ is a linear function of $\\varepsilon$. A linear transformation of a Gaussian random variable results in another Gaussian random variable. Therefore, the distribution of $r_{err}$ is also Gaussian, with a mean of $E[r_{err}] = E[D\\varepsilon/4] = (D/4)E[\\varepsilon] = 0$. The resulting PSF contribution is thus a Gaussian blur.\n\nThe FWHM of any Gaussian distribution is related to its standard deviation $\\sigma$ by the constant factor $2\\sqrt{2\\ln 2}$.\nLet $\\text{FWHM}_r$ and $\\sigma_r$ be the FWHM and standard deviation of the positional error $r_{err}$, and let $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{FWHM}}$ and $\\sigma_\\varepsilon$ be the FWHM and standard deviation of the angular error $\\varepsilon$.\nWe have:\n$$\\text{FWHM}_r = 2\\sqrt{2\\ln 2} \\, \\sigma_r$$\n$$\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{FWHM}} = 2\\sqrt{2\\ln 2} \\, \\sigma_\\varepsilon$$\nFrom the linear relationship $r_{err} = (D/4)\\varepsilon$, the standard deviations are related by $\\sigma_r = (D/4)\\sigma_\\varepsilon$.\nSubstituting this into the equation for $\\text{FWHM}_r$:\n$$\\text{FWHM}_r = 2\\sqrt{2\\ln 2} \\left(\\frac{D}{4}\\sigma_\\varepsilon\\right) = \\frac{D}{4} \\left(2\\sqrt{2\\ln 2} \\, \\sigma_\\varepsilon\\right)$$\nRecognizing the term in the parenthesis as $\\varepsilon_{\\text{FWHM}}$, we obtain a direct relationship between the FWHMs:\n$$\\text{FWHM}_r = \\frac{D}{4} \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{FWHM}}$$\nThis elegant result bypasses the need to explicitly calculate the standard deviations.\n\nThe problem provides $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{FWHM}} = 0.5^\\circ$.
