An ultrasound pulse travels from the transducer to the first reflector, reflects, and returns. It also travels to the second reflector, reflects, and returns. The additional distance the pulse travels to detect the second reflector is a round trip from the first reflector's position to the second's, which is $2 \\Delta z$.\n\nThe time difference, $\\Delta t$, between the arrival of the two echoes at the transducer is related to this path difference by the speed of sound, $c$:\n$$ \\Delta t = \\frac{2 \\Delta z}{c} $$\nFor the two reflectors to be resolved, the time interval $\\Delta t$ must be greater than or equal to the effective duration of the detected echo pulse, which we denote as $\\tau$. If the pulses overlap in time by too much, they will merge into a single, larger echo. The limit of resolution is thus achieved when this temporal separation equals the pulse duration:\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\text{min}} = \\tau $$\nSubstituting this into the previous equation gives the axial resolution $\\Delta z$:\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{2 \\Delta z}{c} $$\nSolving for $\\Delta z$ yields:\n$$ \\Delta z = \\frac{c \\tau}{2} $$\nThis expression shows that the axial resolution is equal to half the spatial pulse length (SPL), where $SPL = c\\tau$.\n\nThe problem states that resolution is limited by the time-frequency behavior of bandlimited signals. A fundamental principle of Fourier analysis, often referred to as the time-bandwidth product or the uncertainty principle for signals, establishes an inverse relationship between the effective temporal duration of a pulse ($\\tau$) and its effective frequency bandwidth ($B$). For the purpose of defining resolution, this relationship is generally approximated as:\n$$ \\tau \\approx \\frac{1}{B} $$\nThis approximation reflects the principle that a signal which is short in time must be broad in frequency content, and vice versa.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $\\tau$ into our equation for $\\Delta z$:\n$$ \\Delta z \\approx \\frac{c}{2B} $$\nThe problem provides the fractional bandwidth, $B_f$, which is defined as the ratio of the bandwidth to the center frequency, $f_c$:\n$$ B_f = \\frac{B}{f_c} $$\nFrom this, we can express the bandwidth $B$ in terms of the given parameters:\n$$ B = B_f f_c $$\nFinally, substituting this into the expression for axial resolution, we arrive at the desired analytic formula:\n$$ \\Delta z = \\frac{c}{2 B_f f_c} $$\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Calculation\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Speed of sound, $c = 1540 \\, \\text{m/s}$\n- Center frequency, $f_c = 5 \\, \\text{MHz} = 5 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{Hz}$\n- Fractional bandwidth, $B_f = 0.7$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived expression for $\\Delta z$:\n$$ \\Delta z = \\frac{1540 \\, \\text{m/s}}{2 \\times 0.7 \\times (5 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{s}^{-1})} $$\nFirst, we calculate the denominator:\n$$ 2 \\times 0.7 \\times (5 \\times 10^6) = 1.4 \\times 5 \\times 10^6 = 7 \\times 10^6 $$\nNow, we compute the value of $\\Delta z$:\n$$ \\Delta z = \\frac{1540}{7 \\times 10^6} \\, \\text{m} = 220 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in millimeters (mm).\n$$ \\Delta z = 220 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m} \\times \\left( \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{mm}}{1 \\, \\text{m}} \\right) = 0.22 \\, \\text{mm} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the numerical value for the axial resolution is $0.2200 \\, \\text{mm}$.\n\n### Part 3: Clinical Implication and Contrast with Lateral Resolution\n\nThe computed axial resolution of $0.2200 \\, \\text{mm}$ (approximately a quarter of a millimeter) is a measure of the system's ability to distinguish fine details along the direction of beam propagation. A smaller value signifies better resolution.\n\n**Clinically Relevant Implication:** This high level of resolution is critical for applications where detailed visualization of layered structures is necessary. A prime example is in vascular imaging for the assessment of atherosclerosis. The walls of arteries like the carotid are composed of thin layers (intima, media, adventitia). An axial resolution of $0.2200 \\, \\text{mm}$ allows for the measurement of the combined intima-media thickness (IMT). An increased IMT is a well-established preclinical marker of cardiovascular disease. The ability to resolve and measure such fine structures enables early diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. This example highlights the direct relationship between a physical parameter of the imaging system and its diagnostic capability.\n\n**Contrast with Lateral Resolution:**\n1.  **Physical Basis:** Axial resolution is determined by the temporal/spatial length of the ultrasound pulse, governed by the transducer's center frequency ($f_c$) and bandwidth ($B_f$). In contrast, lateral resolution (the ability to distinguish reflectors perpendicular to the beam axis) is determined by the ultrasound beam's width.\n2.  **Depth Dependence:** A key difference is their behavior with depth. Axial resolution, being dependent on pulse length, is largely constant throughout the imaged depth. Lateral resolution, however, is highly dependent on the beam width, which changes with distance from the transducer. It is best at the focal zone, where the beam is narrowest, and degrades at other depths.\n3.  **Controlling Factors:** Clinicians choose transducers with higher frequencies to improve axial resolution (as $\\Delta z \\propto 1/f_c$), with the trade-off being reduced penetration depth due to higher attenuation. While axial resolution is thus an intrinsic characteristic of the probe and pulse, lateral resolution can be optimized by the operator by adjusting the electronic focus to the specific depth of interest. Typically, for a well-designed focused system, the axial resolution is superior (i.e., a smaller number) to the lateral resolution at all depths.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2200}$$", "id": "4865813"}, {"introduction": "While axial resolution describes detail along the beam axis, lateral resolution defines the ability to distinguish objects perpendicular to the beam. This practice explores the crucial insight that both types of resolution are fundamentally tied to the acoustic wavelength, $\\lambda$.

Axial Resolution Scaling**\n\nAxial resolution, $\\delta_a$, is the minimum resolvable distance between two point scatterers along the direction of beam propagation. The problem specifies using the two-way time-of-flight separability criterion. This criterion states that two distinct echoes can be resolved if they are separated in time by at least the duration of the transmitted pulse, $\\tau$.\n\nLet two reflectors be separated by an axial distance $\\Delta z$. The ultrasound pulse must travel to the first reflector and back, and to the second reflector and back. The difference in the total path length traveled is $2\\Delta z$. The corresponding time-of-flight difference, $\\Delta t$, is given by:\n$$ \\Delta t = \\frac{2\\Delta z}{c} $$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of sound.\nFor the two reflectors to be minimally resolved, this time difference must equal the pulse duration, $\\tau$. The minimum resolvable distance is the axial resolution, $\\delta_a$.\n$$ \\frac{2\\delta_a}{c} = \\tau \\implies \\delta_a = \\frac{c\\tau}{2} $$\nThe problem states that the transmitted pulse consists of $n$ cycles of a sinusoid at a center frequency $f$. The period of one cycle is $T = 1/f$. Therefore, the pulse duration is:\n$$ \\tau = nT = \\frac{n}{f} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\tau$ into the equation for $\\delta_a$:\n$$ \\delta_a = \\frac{c}{2} \\left( \\frac{n}{f} \\right) = \\frac{n}{2} \\left( \\frac{c}{f} \\right) $$\nUsing the fundamental definition of wavelength, $\\lambda = c/f$, we obtain the expression for axial resolution:\n$$ \\delta_a = \\frac{n\\lambda}{2} $$\nSince $n$ is a constant, the scaling of axial resolution with wavelength is a direct proportionality:\n$$ \\delta_a \\propto \\lambda $$\n\n**2. Lateral Resolution Scaling**\n\nLateral resolution, $\\delta_l$, is the minimum resolvable distance between two point scatterers perpendicular to the beam axis. For a focused system, the best lateral resolution is achieved at the focal plane and is determined by the beam width at that location. The problem directs the use of scalar diffraction theory for a uniformly illuminated circular aperture, specifically the Rayleigh criterion.\n\nAccording to the Rayleigh criterion for a circular aperture of diameter $D$, the angular separation, $\\theta$, from the center of the beam to the first minimum of the diffraction pattern (the edge of the Airy disk) is given by:\n$$ \\sin(\\theta) = 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D} $$\nFor typical medical imaging scenarios, the angle $\\theta$ is small, so we can use the small-angle approximation $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$.\n$$ \\theta \\approx 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D} $$\nThe lateral resolution, $\\delta_l$, is defined as the radius of the central focal spot (the Airy disk). At the focal distance $z$, this radius is given by:\n$$ \\delta_l = z \\tan(\\theta) $$\nAgain, using the small-angle approximation $\\tan(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$:\n$$ \\delta_l \\approx z \\theta \\approx z \\left( 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D} \\right) $$\nThis expression is often written in terms of the F-number, $F_{\\#} = z/D$:\n$$ \\delta_l \\approx 1.22 \\lambda F_{\\#} $$\nSince the focal distance $z$ and aperture diameter $D$ are held constant, the F-number is constant. The numerical prefactor $1.22$ is also a constant. Therefore, the scaling of lateral resolution with wavelength is a direct proportionality:\n$$ \\delta_l \\propto \\lambda $$\n\n**3. Calculation of Improvement Factors**\n\nAn \"improvement\" in resolution means a decrease in the minimum separable distance ($\\delta_a$ or $\\delta_l$). The multiplicative improvement factor is the ratio of the initial resolution to the final resolution. We are increasing the frequency from $f_1$ to $f_2$.\n\nThe relationship between wavelength and frequency is $\\lambda = c/f$. The initial and final wavelengths are $\\lambda_1 = c/f_1$ and $\\lambda_2 = c/f_2$, respectively.\n\nThe axial resolution improvement factor, $I_a$, is:\n$$ I_a = \\frac{\\delta_{a,1}}{\\delta_{a,2}} = \\frac{n\\lambda_1/2}{n\\lambda_2/2} = \\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_2} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for wavelength:\n$$ I_a = \\frac{c/f_1}{c/f_2} = \\frac{f_2}{f_1} $$\nThe lateral resolution improvement factor, $I_l$, is:\n$$ I_l = \\frac{\\delta_{l,1}}{\\delta_{l,2}} = \\frac{1.22 \\lambda_1 F_{\\#}}{1.22 \\lambda_2 F_{\\#}} = \\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_2} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for wavelength:\n$$ I_l = \\frac{c/f_1}{c/f_2} = \\frac{f_2}{f_1} $$\nBoth improvement factors are identical and equal to the ratio of the frequencies.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $f_1 = 5.5 \\times 10^6~\\text{Hz}$ and $f_2 = 8.0 \\times 10^6~\\text{Hz}$.\n$$ I_a = I_l = \\frac{8.0 \\times 10^6}{5.5 \\times 10^6} = \\frac{8.0}{5.5} \\approx 1.454545... $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get $1.455$.\n\nThe final answer is a two-entry row matrix containing the axial and lateral improvement factors.\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} I_a & I_l \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.455 & 1.455 \\end{pmatrix} $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.455 & 1.455\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4865818"}, {"introduction": "Modern ultrasound probes are not single crystals but sophisticated arrays of many small, individual elements. This design enables electronic focusing and steering but introduces a unique challenge: the potential for grating lobes. These are unwanted, off-axis secondary beams that can create strong artifacts, degrading lateral resolution and overall image contrast. This exercise delves into the wave interference principles that produce these lobes and challenges you to derive the fundamental design rule—the maximum element spacing—that engineers must follow to prevent them from corrupting the image [@problem_id:4865849].", "problem": "A one-dimensional linear ultrasound array operating in soft tissue uses identical elements with uniform spacing along the lateral axis. The transmit beam is not electronically steered, so the desired main lobe points at a steering angle of $\\theta=0^{\\circ}$ (broadside).

For an ultrasound system, the PSF characterizes the shape and intensity of the signal received from a single, infinitesimally small scatterer. The lateral resolution, which is the ability to distinguish two closely spaced objects perpendicular to the beam axis, is determined by the width of the main lobe of the PSF in the lateral dimension. A narrower main lobe corresponds to better lateral resolution. The contrast of an image is its ability to differentiate an object from its background, often measured by the ratio of the main lobe's peak intensity to the intensity of its sidelobes.\n\nAn ultrasound transducer array is a spatially sampled aperture, consisting of a finite number of discrete elements. The far-field beam pattern, which is the lateral profile of the PSF, is related to the spatial Fourier transform of the array's aperture function. For a continuous, unweighted aperture, the beam pattern would be a sinc function, featuring a single main lobe and decaying sidelobes.\n\nHowever, the process of sampling the aperture with discrete elements of spacing $d$ introduces periodicity into the beam pattern. According to the sampling theorem, this spatial sampling causes the spectrum (the beam pattern in the angular domain) to be replicated at intervals determined by the sampling frequency, which is inversely related to the element pitch $d$. These replicas of the main lobe are known as grating lobes. They are spurious, high-sensitivity beams directed at angles far from the intended steering direction.\n\nGrating lobes degrade image quality in two critical ways:\n\n$1$. **Degradation of Lateral Resolution:** The imaging system assumes that all detected echoes originate from the direction of the main beam. If a grating lobe interrogates a highly reflective object, the returning echo is strong. The system will misinterpret this echo as coming from the main lobe's direction and will place a bright artifact, or \"ghost,\" in the image at an incorrect lateral position. This superposition of anatomical information from different spatial locations effectively blurs the image and reduces the system's ability to resolve distinct features, thereby degrading lateral resolution.\n\n$2$. **Reduction of Contrast:** Contrast is compromised when grating lobes pick up strong signals from surrounding tissues or bone and map them into a region of interest that is supposed to be anechoic (echo-free) or has low reflectivity. For example, a cystic structure, which should appear dark, may be filled with bright artifactual echoes caused by a grating lobe intersecting a highly reflective boundary elsewhere. This artifact raises the noise floor in the image and reduces the signal difference between the target and its background, leading to a significant loss of image contrast.\n\nIn summary, grating lobes act as unintended \"sidelights\" that corrupt the image by introducing artifacts, blurring features, and reducing contrast, fundamentally by compromising the integrity of the system's PSF.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Grating Lobe-Free Condition**\n\nWe model the one-dimensional linear array as a series of point sources located at positions $x_m = m d$, where $d$ is the element pitch (center-to-center spacing) and $m$ is an integer indexing the element. We seek to find the total pressure field in the far field at an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the array normal.\n\nFor a broadside beam ($\\theta_s = 0^{\\circ}$), all elements are excited with the same phase. The path length difference for a wave originating from element $m$ relative to the central element ($m=0$) to a distant point at angle $\\theta$ is $\\Delta L_m = x_m \\sin\\theta = m d \\sin\\theta$.\n\nThis path difference results in a phase difference of $\\Delta \\phi_m = k \\Delta L_m$, where $k$ is the wavenumber, defined as $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$. Here, $\\lambda$ is the acoustic wavelength.\nThus, the phase difference is $\\Delta \\phi_m = k m d \\sin\\theta$.\n\nThe total field is the coherent sum of contributions from all elements. The locations of principal maxima (constructive interference) occur when the phase difference between adjacent elements is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$. For adjacent elements, the index difference is $\\Delta m = 1$. The phase difference is therefore $\\Delta \\phi = k d \\sin\\theta$.\nThe condition for constructive interference is:\n$$k d \\sin\\theta_p = 2\\pi p, \\quad \\text{for integer } p$$\nwhere $\\theta_p$ are the angles of the principal maxima.\n\nSubstituting the definition of the wavenumber $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\right) d \\sin\\theta_p = 2\\pi p$$\nThis simplifies to the grating-lobe equation for a broadside beam:\n$$d \\sin\\theta_p = p \\lambda$$\n\nThe integer $p=0$ corresponds to the main lobe. Since $\\sin\\theta_0 = 0$, the main lobe is at $\\theta_0 = 0^{\\circ}$, which is the desired broadside direction.\nThe integers $p = \\pm1, \\pm2, \\ldots$ correspond to the grating lobes. For $p=\\pm1$, we find the first-order grating lobes at angles $\\theta_{\\pm1}$ given by:\n$$\\sin\\theta_{\\pm1} = \\pm\\frac{\\lambda}{d}$$\n\nAn ultrasound imaging system can only form an image from real angles, which lie in the \"visible range\" of $-90^{\\circ} \\le \\theta \\le +90^{\\circ}$. This corresponds to the mathematical condition $|\\sin\\theta| \\le 1$. A grating lobe becomes visible if its angle $\\theta_p$ falls within this range.\n\nTo prevent any grating lobe from appearing in the visible range, we must ensure that the angle of the first-order grating lobe ($p=\\pm1$) lies outside this range. This requires its sine to be greater than $1$ in magnitude:\n$$|\\sin\\theta_{\\pm1}| > 1$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sin\\theta_{\\pm1}$:\n$$\\left|\\pm\\frac{\\lambda}{d}\\right| > 1$$\n$$\\frac{\\lambda}{d} > 1$$\nThis yields the condition on the element pitch $d$ to completely suppress all grating lobes from the visible field of view for a broadside beam:\n$$d < \\lambda$$\n\nThe maximum allowable pitch, $d_{max}$, is the theoretical limit where the first-order grating lobe would just begin to enter the visible range at $\\theta = \\pm90^{\\circ}$.
