Derivation of the Continuous Wave (CW) Doppler Shift**\n\nThe derivation accounts for two sequential Doppler shifts: first, the shift experienced by the moving scatterer (red blood cell) as it receives the incident wave, and second, the shift imparted by the moving scatterer as it re-radiates the wave back to the stationary transducer. We use the first-order approximation for speeds much less than the wave speed ($v \\ll c$).\n\nLet the stationary transducer be at the origin. The ultrasound beam propagates with wave vector $\\mathbf{k}_0$ and frequency $f_0$. A scatterer (e.g., a red blood cell) moves with a constant velocity $\\mathbf{v}$. Its position at time $t$ is given by $\\mathbf{r}(t) = \\mathbf{v}t$, assuming it passes through the origin at $t=0$ without loss of generality.\n\nThe phase of the incident wave as perceived by the moving scatterer is:\n$$ \\phi_{scat}(t) = 2\\pi f_0 t - \\mathbf{k}_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{r}(t) = 2\\pi f_0 t - \\mathbf{k}_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{v}t $$\nThe instantaneous frequency perceived by the scatterer, $f_1$, is the time derivative of the phase divided by $2\\pi$:\n$$ f_1 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\phi_{scat}(t)}{dt} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\frac{d}{dt}(2\\pi f_0 t - (\\mathbf{k}_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{v})t) = f_0 - \\frac{\\mathbf{k}_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{v}}{2\\pi} $$\nThe magnitude of the wave vector is $|\\mathbf{k}_0| = k_0 = \\frac{2\\pi f_0}{c}$. Let $\\theta$ be the angle between the wave propagation direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}_0$ and the scatterer's velocity $\\mathbf{v}$. Then $\\mathbf{k}_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = k_0 v \\cos\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi f_0 v \\cos\\theta}{c}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $f_1$:\n$$ f_1 = f_0 - \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi f_0 v \\cos\\theta}{c} \\right) = f_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{v \\cos\\theta}{c} \\right) $$\nThis is the frequency of the wave received and then re-radiated by the scatterer.\n\nNext, we consider the second Doppler shift. The scatterer, moving with velocity $\\mathbf{v}$, acts as a source emitting a wave of frequency $f_1$. The stationary transducer receives this wave. The wave is radiated back towards the source, so the relevant wave propagation direction is now $-\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}_0$. The component of the source's velocity in the direction of the receiver (the transducer) is $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}_0 = v \\cos\\theta$. The non-relativistic Doppler formula for a moving source is $f_{rec} = f_{src} / (1 - v_{s,r}/c)$, where $v_{s,r}$ is the component of the source velocity towards the receiver. In our case, $v_{s,r} = v \\cos\\theta$.\nThe frequency $f_2$ received by the transducer is:\n$$ f_2 = \\frac{f_1}{1 - \\frac{v \\cos\\theta}{c}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $f_1$:\n$$ f_2 = \\frac{f_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{v \\cos\\theta}{c} \\right)}{1 - \\frac{v \\cos\\theta}{c}} $$\nThe above expression is for a target moving away from the transducer. In the backscatter geometry, the component of velocity away from the transducer for the outbound path is $v \\cos\\theta$, and the component of velocity toward the transducer for the inbound path is also $v \\cos\\theta$. The correct formulation using standard Doppler shifts is:\nFrequency at scatterer (moving receiver): $f_1 = f_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{v \\cos \\theta}{c}\\right)$. Here, velocity component toward the source is assumed to be $v \\cos\\theta$. Let's assume $\\theta$ is defined such that $v \\cos\\theta$ is the component of velocity directed away from the transducer.\nThen $f_1 = f_0 (1 - \\frac{v \\cos\\theta}{c})$.\nThe scatterer re-radiates at $f_1$ and moves away from the transducer with component $v \\cos\\theta$. The received frequency is $f_2 = \\frac{f_1}{1 + \\frac{v \\cos\\theta}{c}}$.\n$$ f_2 = f_0 \\frac{1 - \\frac{v \\cos\\theta}{c}}{1 + \\frac{v \\cos\\theta}{c}} $$\nThis is the exact non-relativistic expression. For a first-order expansion where $v \\ll c$, let $x = \\frac{v \\cos\\theta}{c}$. We use the approximation $(1+x)^{-1} \\approx 1-x$ for $|x| \\ll 1$.\n$$ f_2 \\approx f_0 (1-x)(1-x) = f_0 (1-x)^2 = f_0 (1 - 2x + x^2) $$\nIgnoring the second-order term $x^2 = (\\frac{v \\cos\\theta}{c})^2$ as it is negligible for $v \\ll c$:\n$$ f_2 \\approx f_0 (1 - 2x) = f_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{2v \\cos\\theta}{c} \\right) $$\nThe Doppler frequency shift, $\\Delta f$, is the difference between the received frequency $f_2$ and the transmitted frequency $f_0$:\n$$ \\Delta f = f_2 - f_0 \\approx f_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{2v \\cos\\theta}{c} \\right) - f_0 = - \\frac{2 f_0 v \\cos\\theta}{c} $$\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of this shift, which we denote as $f_D$:\n$$ f_D = |\\Delta f| = \\frac{2 f_0 v |\\cos\\theta|}{c} $$\nThis is the required expression. The sign of the shift indicates direction: a negative sign (as for $0 \\le \\theta  90^\\circ$) corresponds to a frequency decrease, meaning the scatterer has a component of motion away from the transducer.

Therefore, the shift is readily detectable.\n\nThe primary assumption made in this analysis, as is standard for this simplified model, is that the Doppler shift is generated by scatterers moving at a single, constant velocity $v$. The formula specifically relies on the component of this velocity projected onto the axis of the ultrasound beam, which is $v \\cos\\theta$. In a real physiological scenario, blood flow is not uniform; it exhibits a velocity profile across the vessel (laminar or turbulent flow) and is typically pulsatile (varying with the cardiac cycle). A real CW Doppler system would therefore receive a spectrum of frequencies, not a single frequency. Our calculation of $6748 \\ \\mathrm{Hz}$ would correspond to the shift from scatterers moving at precisely $v=1.2 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$ at an angle of $\\theta=30^\\circ$.

This relationship is given by the Doppler equation:\n$$f_D = \\frac{2 f_0 v \\cos(\\theta)}{c}$$\nwhere $f_0$ is the transmitted ultrasound frequency, $c$ is the speed of sound in the medium (tissue), $v$ is the true speed of the blood flow, and $\\theta$ is the true angle between the ultrasound beam and the direction of blood flow. The factor of $2$ arises from the two-way path of the ultrasound wave (transmitting to the scatterer and receiving the echo).\n\nThe ultrasound system measures a single value for the Doppler shift, $f_D$.
