The time interval between successive transmitted pulses is the Pulse Repetition Interval, denoted as $T_{PRI}$. The time required for an ultrasound pulse to travel to an axial depth $d$ and return is the two-way time-of-flight, $T_{flight}$.

In this context, the condition to avoid aliasing is:\n$$\nPRF \\ge 2|f_D|\n$$\nThe frequency $2|f_D|$ is often referred to as the Nyquist frequency, and half the PRF, $PRF/2$, is called the Nyquist limit.\n\nLet us calculate the Doppler shift for the given parameters:\n$v = 2\\ \\text{m/s}$\n$f_0 = 6\\ \\text{MHz} = 6 \\times 10^6\\ \\text{Hz}$\n$\\theta = 45^\\circ$, so $\\cos(45^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$\n$c = 1540\\ \\text{m/s}$\n\n$$\nf_D = \\frac{2 \\times (2\\ \\text{m/s}) \\times (6 \\times 10^6\\ \\text{Hz}) \\times \\cos(45^\\circ)}{1540\\ \\text{m/s}} = \\frac{24 \\times 10^6 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}{1540}\\ \\text{Hz} \\approx 11019.5\\ \\text{Hz}\n$$\nThe required minimum $PRF$ to avoid aliasing would be:\n$$\nPRF_{min, Doppler} = 2 |f_D| \\approx 2 \\times 11019.5\\ \\text{Hz} = 22039\\ \\text{Hz}\n$$\nThis required $PRF$ is approximately $22.04\\ \\text{kHz}$.\n\nConclusion: Joint Satisfiability\n\nThe maximum $PRF$ that allows for unambiguous range determination at a depth of $12\\ \\text{cm}$ is $PRF_{max} \\approx 6.417\\ \\text{kHz}$.\nThe minimum $PRF$ required to measure the specified velocity without aliasing is $PRF_{min, Doppler} \\approx 22.04\\ \\text{kHz}$.\n\nSince $PRF_{max} < PRF_{min, Doppler}$ ($6.417\\ \\text{kHz} < 22.04\\ \\text{kHz}$), it is not possible to simultaneously satisfy both conditions.

This physical condition ($|f_d| > f_{Nyquist}$) is the definition of aliasing. This occurs at the signal acquisition and processing stage, before any conversion to velocity for display. The angle correction factor is applied only in this final display stage. Therefore, the occurrence of aliasing is a physical fact determined by the acquisition parameters and flow conditions, and is indeed independent of the angle correction setting.\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Using a smaller angle correction $\\theta_{\\text{assumed}} = 20^\\circ$ increases $v_{\\max}$, making aliasing less likely to be suspected for the same spectrum.**\n**Analysis:** The maximum displayed velocity, $v_{\\max}$, corresponds to the Nyquist frequency, $f_{Nyquist}$. Its value is determined by the angle correction setting:\n$$v_{\\max} = \\frac{f_{Nyquist} \\cdot c}{2 f_0 \\cos\\theta_{\\text{assumed}}}$$\nThe value of $v_{\\max}$ is inversely proportional to $\\cos\\theta_{\\text{assumed}}$. For angles $\\theta \\in [0^\\circ, 90^\\circ]$, $\\cos\\theta$ is a decreasing function. Therefore, a smaller angle $\\theta$ results in a larger value of $\\cos\\theta$.

Using $\\theta_{\\text{assumed}} = 20^\\circ$ instead of a larger angle like $\\theta_{\\text{true}} = 55^\\circ$ will *decrease*, not increase, the displayed $v_{\\max}$.

The negative-frequency wrap observed is consistent with aliasing rather than true flow reversal; correcting the angle to $\\theta_{\\text{true}} = 55^\\circ$ will change the displayed velocity scale but cannot eliminate aliasing unless $\\mathrm{PRF}$ is increased (or $f_0$ is reduced).**\n**Analysis:** Our calculation shows that a high positive true frequency ($f_d \\approx +9.39\\,\\text{kHz}$) aliases to a low negative frequency ($f_{alias} \\approx -0.61\\,\\text{kHz}$). This perfectly explains the observation and confirms it is aliasing, not a low-velocity flow reversal. Changing the angle setting from $\\theta_{\\text{assumed}} = 20^\\circ$ to $\\theta_{\\text{true}} = 55^\\circ$ is a post-processing step that only alters the scale of the velocity axis on the display. It does not change the underlying sampled frequencies. The physical condition of aliasing ($|f_d| > f_{Nyquist}$) remains. To eliminate aliasing, one must alter the physical parameters to ensure $|f_d| \\le f_{Nyquist}$. This can be achieved by increasing $f_{Nyquist}$ (by increasing PRF) or by decreasing $|f_d|$ (by decreasing $f_0$, for instance). The statement accurately describes this.\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**D. Apparent violations of the system’s displayed $v_{\\max}$ can occur on the velocity display if $\\theta$ is misestimated; a spectral peak can exceed the displayed $v_{\\max}$ purely due to incorrect angle correction.**\n**Analysis:** The velocity display axis is constructed to range from $-v_{\\max}$ to $+v_{\\max}$, where $v_{\\max}$ is calculated using the assumed angle $\\theta_{\\text{assumed}}$. The displayed frequency spectrum, whether aliased or not, is contained within the range $[-f_{Nyquist}, f_{Nyquist}]$. When this frequency range is mapped to a velocity range, the result must be contained within $[-v_{\\max}, +v_{\\max}]$. A spectral peak, which corresponds to some frequency $f_{peak}$ where $|f_{peak}| \\le f_{Nyquist}$, will be displayed at a velocity $v_{peak} = \\frac{f_{peak} \\cdot c}{2 f_0 \\cos\\theta_{\\text{assumed}}}$. Since $|f_{peak}| \\le f_{Nyquist}$, it follows that $|v_{peak}| \\le v_{\\max}$. Therefore, a spectral peak *on the display* can never appear outside the displayed velocity limits. Angle misestimation scales both the velocity of the peak and the velocity limit by the same factor ($1/\\cos\\theta_{\\text{assumed}}$), so their relative position is unchanged. An \"apparent violation\" is a conceptual error: the true velocity may exceed the displayed limit, but this is precisely the condition that leads to aliasing, causing the *displayed* peak to appear well within the limits. The statement claims a peak can exceed the displayed limit purely due to angle correction, which is physically impossible.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Increasing $\\mathrm{PRF}$ increases the Nyquist limit for the Doppler frequency, and reducing $f_0$ reduces the Doppler frequency produced by a given $v$; both actions increase the maximum velocity that can be measured without aliasing and address aliasing regardless of angle estimation errors.**\n**Analysis:** The condition to avoid aliasing is $|f_d| \\le f_{Nyquist}$. The maximum measurable velocity, $v_{\\text{unaliased_max}}$, is found when $|f_d| = f_{Nyquist}$:\n$$|\\frac{2 f_0 v_{\\text{unaliased_max}} \\cos\\theta}{c}| = \\frac{\\mathrm{PRF}}{2} \\implies v_{\\text{unaliased_max}} = \\frac{c \\cdot \\mathrm{PRF}}{4 f_0 |\\cos\\theta|}$$\nThis equation shows that $v_{\\text{unaliased_max}}$ is directly proportional to PRF and inversely proportional to $f_0$. Thus, increasing PRF or decreasing $f_0$ will increase the maximum velocity that can be measured without aliasing. These actions directly address the physical cause of aliasing. As established in option A, the angle estimation error is a display-level issue and does not affect the physical occurrence of aliasing. Therefore, these physical solutions address aliasing regardless of such errors.\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "4914302"}]}
