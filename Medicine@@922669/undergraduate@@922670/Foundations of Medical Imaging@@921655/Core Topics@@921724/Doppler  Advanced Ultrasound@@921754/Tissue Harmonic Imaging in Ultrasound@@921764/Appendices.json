We begin by examining the fundamental principles as requested.\n\nThe propagation of a finite-amplitude sound wave in a lossless, homogeneous fluid is governed by the one-dimensional equations of continuity and momentum (Euler's equation), along with an equation of state.\nThe equation of continuity is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial (\\rho u)}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density, $u$ is the particle velocity, $t$ is time, and $x$ is the spatial coordinate.\n\nThe equation of motion (Euler's equation for a lossless fluid) is:\n$$\n\\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\right) = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $p$ is the pressure.\n\nThe problem specifies a weakly nonlinear medium and isentropic conditions, for which the equation of state $p(\\rho)$ can be expressed by a Taylor series expansion around the equilibrium state $(\\rho_0, p_0)$. Retaining terms up to the quadratic order gives:\n$$\np - p_0 = A \\left( \\frac{\\rho-\\rho_0}{\\rho_0} \\right) + \\frac{B}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\rho-\\rho_0}{\\rho_0} \\right)^2 + \\dots\n$$\nThe coefficient $A$ is related to the small-signal sound speed $c_0$ by $A = \\rho_0 c_0^2$. The coefficient $B$ characterizes the quadratic nonlinearity. The ratio $B/A$ is the coefficient of nonlinearity provided in the problem. The acoustic pressure is $p' = p - p_0$.\n\nThe fundamental consequence of nonlinearity is that the local propagation speed of a point on the wave is not constant, but depends on the local acoustic amplitude. The local speed of sound, $c$, is given by $c^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\rho}\\right)_S$. Differentiating the equation of state with respect to $\\rho$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\rho} = \\frac{A}{\\rho_0} + \\frac{B}{\\rho_0} \\left( \\frac{\\rho-\\rho_0}{\\rho_0} \\right) = c_0^2 + \\frac{B}{A} c_0^2 \\left( \\frac{\\rho-\\rho_0}{\\rho_0} \\right)\n$$\nThus, the local sound speed is $c = \\sqrt{c_0^2 \\left[ 1 + \\frac{B}{A} \\left( \\frac{\\rho-\\rho_0}{\\rho_0} \\right) \\right]} \\approx c_0 \\left[ 1 + \\frac{B}{2A} \\left( \\frac{\\rho-\\rho_0}{\\rho_0} \\right) \\right]$ for weak nonlinearity.\nFor a progressive plane wave, the particle velocity $u$ is related to the density variation by $u \\approx c_0 \\left( \\frac{\\rho-\\rho_0}{\\rho_0} \\right)$. Substituting this into the expression for $c$ gives:\n$$\nc \\approx c_0 \\left( 1 + \\frac{B}{2A} \\frac{u}{c_0} \\right) = c_0 + \\frac{B}{2A} u\n$$\nThe total velocity of a point on the waveform in the laboratory frame is the sum of this local sound speed and the particle velocity itself:\n$$\nc_{wave} = c + u \\approx c_0 + \\left(1 + \\frac{B}{2A}\\right) u\n$$\nThis expression is simplified using the acoustic nonlinearity parameter $\\beta = 1 + \\frac{B}{2A}$. The propagation speed of a point on the wave with particle velocity $u$ is therefore:\n$$\nc_{wave}(u) = c_0 + \\beta u\n$$\nThis amplitude-dependent speed causes the waveform to distort as it propagates. Regions of high pressure and positive particle velocity (crests) travel faster than regions of low pressure and negative particle velocity (troughs). This progressive steepening of the wavefront eventually leads to a discontinuity, or shock front.\n\nA shock forms at the distance $x_s$ where the slope of the waveform, for instance $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$, first becomes infinite. A formal derivation starting from the governing partial differential equation (the inviscid Burgers' equation, which can be derived from the fundamental equations for this problem) shows that the slope $S(x)$ at a point of initially maximum slope $S_0$ evolves as $S(x) = \\frac{S_0}{1 - x/x_s}$. The slope becomes infinite at $x=x_s$. The shock distance $x_s$ for an initially sinusoidal wave is given by the well-established formula:\n$$\nx_s = \\frac{c_0^2}{\\beta \\omega_0 u_0}\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_0 = 2\\pi f_0$ is the angular frequency and $u_0$ is the peak particle velocity amplitude.\nThe particle velocity amplitude $u_0$ is related to the peak pressure amplitude $p_0$ by the plane-wave acoustic impedance, $u_0 = p_0 / (\\rho_0 c_0)$. Substituting this into the equation for $x_s$ gives the final expression in terms of the given parameters:\n$$\nx_s = \\frac{c_0^2}{\\beta \\omega_0 \\left(\\frac{p_0}{\\rho_0 c_0}\\right)} = \\frac{\\rho_0 c_0^3}{\\beta \\omega_0 p_0}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the provided values into this formula.\nFirst, we calculate the acoustic nonlinearity parameter $\\beta$:\nThe coefficient of nonlinearity is given as $B/A = 6$.\n$$\n\\beta = 1 + \\frac{B}{2A} = 1 + \\frac{6}{2} = 1 + 3 = 4\n$$\nNext, we calculate the angular frequency $\\omega_0$:\nThe fundamental frequency is $f_0 = 2\\,\\mathrm{MHz} = 2 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n$$\n\\omega_0 = 2\\pi f_0 = 2\\pi (2 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) = 4\\pi \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}\n$$\nThe remaining parameters are:\n- $\\rho_0 = 1000\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$\n- $c_0 = 1540\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n- $p_0 = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 0.5 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n\nNow, we compute the shock formation distance $x_s$:\n$$\nx_s = \\frac{(1000\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}) (1540\\,\\mathrm{m/s})^3}{(4) (4\\pi \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) (0.5 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Pa})}\n$$\n$$\nx_s = \\frac{1000 \\times 1540^3}{4 \\times 4\\pi \\times 10^6 \\times 0.5 \\times 10^6} \\,\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\nx_s = \\frac{10^3 \\times (1.54 \\times 10^3)^3}{8\\pi \\times 10^{12}} \\,\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\nx_s = \\frac{10^3 \\times 1.54^3 \\times 10^9}{8\\pi \\times 10^{12}} \\,\\,\\mathrm{m} = \\frac{1.54^3 \\times 10^{12}}{8\\pi \\times 10^{12}} \\,\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\nx_s = \\frac{1.54^3}{8\\pi} \\,\\,\\mathrm{m} \\approx \\frac{3.652264}{25.13274} \\,\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\nx_s \\approx 0.145318\\,\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\nx_s \\approx 0.145\\,\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThis is the distance at which a plane, sinusoidal wave with the given initial parameters would form a shock front in a lossless nonlinear medium with the specified properties.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.145}\n$$", "id": "4937730"}, {"introduction": "While nonlinearity creates the useful harmonic signal, the tissue's attenuation properties present a major challenge.
