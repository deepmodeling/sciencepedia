It is scientifically grounded in the principles of wave physics (the Doppler effect), is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, formal language. All parameters provided are physically realistic for a clinical ultrasound examination.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested: derivation of the Doppler shift equation, calculation of the blood speed, and an analysis of the uncertainty propagation.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Doppler Shift Equation\n\nWe model the process as a two-step Doppler shift. A stationary ultrasound probe transmits a wave of frequency $f_0$. This wave is incident on red blood cells, which are treated as moving reflectors. The blood flows with a speed $v$ at an angle $\\theta$ to the ultrasound beam. The component of the blood velocity along the beam's direction is $v_{\\parallel} = v \\cos(\\theta)$. A positive Doppler shift $\\Delta f$ is measured, which implies an increase in frequency. This occurs when the reflectors are moving toward the source. Thus, we will model the case of blood flowing towards the transducer.\n\nStep 1: Wave from probe to red blood cell.\nThe stationary probe acts as a source of frequency $f_0$. The red blood cell acts as a moving observer, approaching the source with speed $v_{\\parallel} = v \\cos(\\theta)$. The frequency $f_r$ perceived by the red blood cell is given by the classical Doppler effect for a moving observer:\n$$f_r = f_0 \\left( \\frac{c + v_{\\parallel}}{c} \\right) = f_0 \\left( 1 + \\frac{v \\cos(\\theta)}{c} \\right)$$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of the wave in the medium.\n\nStep 2: Wave scattered from red blood cell to probe.\nThe red blood cell now acts as a moving source, emitting waves with the frequency $f_r$ it perceived. This source is moving toward the stationary probe (observer) with speed $v_{\\parallel} = v \\cos(\\theta)$. The frequency $f_d$ detected by the probe is given by the Doppler effect for a moving source:\n$$f_d = f_r \\left( \\frac{c}{c - v_{\\parallel}} \\right) = f_r \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{v \\cos(\\theta)}{c}} \\right)$$\n\nCombining these two steps, we substitute the expression for $f_r$ from Step 1 into the equation for $f_d$:\n$$f_d = f_0 \\left( 1 + \\frac{v \\cos(\\theta)}{c} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{v \\cos(\\theta)}{c}} \\right) = f_0 \\left( \\frac{1 + \\frac{v \\cos(\\theta)}{c}}{1 - \\frac{v \\cos(\\theta)}{c}} \\right)$$\nThe Doppler frequency shift, $\\Delta f$, is the difference between the detected frequency and the transmitted frequency: $\\Delta f = f_d - f_0$.\n$$\\Delta f = f_0 \\left( \\frac{1 + \\frac{v \\cos(\\theta)}{c}}{1 - \\frac{v \\cos(\\theta)}{c}} - 1 \\right) = f_0 \\left( \\frac{1 + \\frac{v \\cos(\\theta)}{c} - \\left(1 - \\frac{v \\cos(\\theta)}{c}\\right)}{1 - \\frac{v \\cos(\\theta)}{c}} \\right)$$\n$$\\Delta f = f_0 \\left( \\frac{2 \\frac{v \\cos(\\theta)}{c}}{1 - \\frac{v \\cos(\\theta)}{c}} \\right) = \\frac{2 f_0 v \\cos(\\theta)}{c - v \\cos(\\theta)}$$\nThe problem states to use the assumption that the blood speed is much smaller than the sound speed, i.e., $v \\ll c$. Since $|\\cos(\\theta)| \\le 1$, this implies that $v \\cos(\\theta) \\ll c$. Therefore, the denominator can be approximated as $c - v \\cos(\\theta) \\approx c$.\nApplying this approximation, we obtain the standard Doppler shift equation used in medical ultrasound:\n$$\\Delta f \\approx \\frac{2 f_0 v \\cos(\\theta)}{c}$$\nThis expression relates the measured Doppler shift $\\Delta f$ to the blood speed $v$, the insonation angle $\\theta$, the transmit frequency $f_0$, and the speed of sound $c$.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of Blood Speed\n\nWe rearrange the derived expression to solve for the blood speed $v$:\n$$v = \\frac{\\Delta f \\cdot c}{2 f_0 \\cos(\\theta)}$$\nThe given parameters are:\nTransmitted frequency, $f_0 = 5\\,\\mathrm{MHz} = 5 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\nSpeed of sound, $c = 1540\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.\nDoppler frequency shift, $\\Delta f = 3.00\\,\\mathrm{kHz} = 3.00 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\nInsonation angle, $\\theta = 60^{\\circ}$.\n\nWe first evaluate the cosine of the angle: $\\cos(60^{\\circ}) = 0.5$.\nSubstituting the numerical values into the equation for $v$:\n$$v = \\frac{(3.00 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\cdot (1540\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}})}{2 \\cdot (5 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\cdot (0.5)}$$\n$$v = \\frac{4.62 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}}{5 \\times 10^6} = 0.924\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$v = 0.9240\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$$\n\nPart 3: Uncertainty Analysis and Interpretation\n\nWe want to determine how the fractional error in the velocity estimate, $\\frac{\\delta v}{v}$, depends on a small error in the insonation angle, $\\delta \\theta$. Our expression for velocity is:\n$$v = \\frac{\\Delta f \\cdot c}{2 f_0} \\frac{1}{\\cos(\\theta)}$$\nFor this analysis, we treat $f_0$, $\\Delta f$, and $c$ as constants and examine the variation of $v$ with respect to $\\theta$. Let $K = \\frac{\\Delta f \\cdot c}{2 f_0}$, so $v = K (\\cos(\\theta))^{-1}$.\nUsing the method of propagation of uncertainty for a function of a single variable, the uncertainty $\\delta v$ resulting from an uncertainty $\\delta \\theta$ is given by $\\delta v \\approx |\\frac{dv}{d\\theta}| \\delta \\theta$.\nFirst, we find the derivative of $v$ with respect to $\\theta$:\n$$\\frac{dv}{d\\theta} = \\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\left[ K (\\cos(\\theta))^{-1} \\right] = K \\left[ -1 (\\cos(\\theta))^{-2} (-\\sin(\\theta)) \\right] = K \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\cos^2(\\theta)}$$\nThe fractional error in $v$ is $\\frac{\\delta v}{v}$:\n$$\\frac{\\delta v}{v} \\approx \\frac{|K \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\cos^2(\\theta)} \\delta \\theta|}{|K (\\cos(\\theta))^{-1}|} = \\frac{\\frac{|\\sin(\\theta)|}{\\cos^2(\\theta)}}{ \\frac{1}{|\\cos(\\theta)|}} |\\delta \\theta|$$\nIn clinical applications, the angle $\\theta$ is typically acute, so $0^{\\circ} \\le \\theta  90^{\\circ}$, which means $\\sin(\\theta) \\ge 0$ and $\\cos(\\theta)  0$. We can therefore drop the absolute value signs.\n$$\\frac{\\delta v}{v} \\approx \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\cos(\\theta)} \\delta \\theta = \\tan(\\theta) \\delta \\theta$$\nNote that for this relation to be dimensionally correct, the angular error $\\delta \\theta$ must be expressed in radians.\n\nQualitative Interpretation:\nThe fractional error in the calculated velocity, $\\frac{\\delta v}{v}$, is directly proportional to $\\tan(\\theta)$ and the magnitude of the angular error, $\\delta \\theta$. The function $\\tan(\\theta)$ grows non-linearly with $\\theta$.\n-   For small angles (i.e., $\\theta \\to 0^{\\circ}$), $\\tan(\\theta) \\to 0$. In this regime, the fractional error in velocity is very small, even for a non-zero angular error $\\delta \\theta$. This means that measurements made with the ultrasound beam nearly parallel to the blood flow are robust against small errors in angle estimation.\n-   As the angle $\\theta$ increases, $\\tan(\\theta)$ increases. At $\\theta=45^{\\circ}$, $\\tan(45^{\\circ})=1$, meaning the fractional error in velocity is equal to the angular error (in radians).\n-   At $\\theta=60^{\\circ}$, $\\tan(60^{\\circ}) = \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$. The fractional error in velocity is now $1.732$ times the angular error.\n-   As the angle approaches perpendicularity (i.e., $\\theta \\to 90^{\\circ}$), $\\tan(\\theta) \\to \\infty$. In this region, the expression for the fractional error diverges. This implies that any tiny, unavoidable error in measuring the angle $\\theta$ will be hugely amplified, leading to a massive and unreliable error in the calculated velocity $v$.\nTherefore, for accurate and reliable clinical measurements of blood velocity, it is critical to avoid large insonation angles. Angles approaching $90^{\\circ}$ are unacceptable.

The axial component of the blood velocity along the ultrasound beam is $v_{axial} = v \\cos\\theta$. For velocities much less than the speed of sound ($|v| \\ll c$), which is the case here, the Doppler frequency shift $f_D$ is accurately approximated by the linearized equation:\n$$f_D = \\frac{2 f_{0} v_{axial}}{c} = \\frac{2 f_{0} v \\cos\\theta}{c}$$\nThe problem defines $v  0$ for flow toward the transducer. This corresponds to a positive Doppler shift ($f_D  0$), which is consistent with the formula, given that $\\theta = 60^{\\circ}$ implies $\\cos\\theta  0$.\n\n**Aliasing in Pulsed Doppler**\nIn a pulsed system, the Doppler signal is sampled at the Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF). This sampling process can lead to aliasing.
