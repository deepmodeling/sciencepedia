The problem is one-dimensional. The transducer element is assumed to be of infinite extent in the elevation (out-of-plane) direction, so diffraction is only considered in the lateral (azimuthal) plane.\n2.  The analysis is performed under Fraunhofer (far-field) conditions.

The vibrating element surface has a uniform velocity distribution, acting as a rectangular piston source.\n5.  The analysis is performed for a continuous wave at a single frequency $f_0$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Element Factor Expression**\n\nThe problem states that the far-field angular pressure spectrum is proportional to the spatial Fourier transform of the aperture velocity distribution. We begin by defining the aperture function, $A(x)$, for a uniformly excited rectangular element of width $w$ centered at the origin ($x=0$). The velocity is constant across the face of the element and zero elsewhere. This can be expressed using the rectangular function, $\\text{rect}(u)$, which is defined as $1$ for $|u| \\le \\frac{1}{2}$ and $0$ otherwise.\nThe aperture function is:\n$$\nA(x) = v_0 \\cdot \\text{rect}\\left(\\frac{x}{w}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $v_0$ is the constant velocity amplitude.\n\nThe far-field pressure amplitude pattern, $P(\\theta)$, as a function of the observation angle $\\theta$ from broadside, is proportional to the Fourier transform of $A(x)$. The Fourier transform is evaluated at the spatial frequency $k_x$.\n$$\nP(\\theta) \\propto \\mathcal{F}\\{A(x)\\}(k_x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} A(x) e^{-j k_x x} dx\n$$\nIn the far-field, the spatial frequency $k_x$ is related to the angle $\\theta$ and the acoustic wavenumber $k$ by the projection:\n$$\nk_x = k \\sin(\\theta)\n$$\nThe wavenumber $k$ is given by $k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} = \\frac{2\\pi f_0}{c}$, where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength, $f_0$ is the frequency, and $c$ is the speed of sound.\n\nSubstituting the aperture function $A(x)$ into the Fourier transform integral:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}\\{A(x)\\}(k_x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} v_0 \\cdot \\text{rect}\\left(\\frac{x}{w}\\right) e^{-j k_x x} dx = v_0 \\int_{-w/2}^{w/2} e^{-j k_x x} dx\n$$\nEvaluating the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{-w/2}^{w/2} e^{-j k_x x} dx = \\left[ \\frac{e^{-j k_x x}}{-j k_x} \\right]_{-w/2}^{w/2} = \\frac{e^{-j k_x w/2} - e^{j k_x w/2}}{-j k_x}\n$$\nUsing Euler's formula, $\\sin(u) = \\frac{e^{ju} - e^{-ju}}{2j}$, we can rewrite the expression:\n$$\n\\frac{e^{j k_x w/2} - e^{-j k_x w/2}}{j k_x} = \\frac{2 \\sin(k_x w/2)}{k_x}\n$$\nTo express this in the standard `sinc` function form, where $\\text{sinc}(u) = \\frac{\\sin(u)}{u}$, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $w/2$:\n$$\n\\frac{2 \\sin(k_x w/2)}{k_x} = w \\cdot \\frac{\\sin(k_x w/2)}{k_x w/2} = w \\cdot \\text{sinc}\\left(\\frac{k_x w}{2}\\right)\n$$\nSo, the unnormalized pressure pattern is:\n$$\nP(\\theta) \\propto v_0 w \\cdot \\text{sinc}\\left(\\frac{k_x w}{2}\\right)\n$$\nNow, substitute $k_x = k \\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{2\\pi f_0}{c} \\sin(\\theta)$:\n$$\nP(\\theta) \\propto v_0 w \\cdot \\text{sinc}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{2\\pi f_0}{c} \\sin(\\theta) \\right] w \\right) = v_0 w \\cdot \\text{sinc}\\left(\\frac{\\pi f_0 w \\sin(\\theta)}{c}\\right)\n$$\nThe element factor, $EF(\\theta)$, is defined as the magnitude of this pressure pattern, normalized to its maximum value. The maximum occurs at broadside, i.e., at $\\theta=0$. At $\\theta=0$, $\\sin(\\theta)=0$, and the argument of the sinc function is $0$. Since $\\text{sinc}(0)=1$, the maximum value of the expression is proportional to $v_0 w$.\nNormalizing by this maximum value gives the element factor magnitude:\n$$\nEF(\\theta) = \\left| \\frac{v_0 w \\cdot \\text{sinc}\\left(\\frac{\\pi f_0 w \\sin(\\theta)}{c}\\right)}{v_0 w \\cdot \\text{sinc}(0)} \\right| = \\left| \\text{sinc}\\left(\\frac{\\pi f_0 w \\sin(\\theta)}{c}\\right) \\right|\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the element factor magnitude.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate $EF(\\theta)$ for the following parameters:\n- Angle: $\\theta = 30^\\circ$\n- Element width: $w = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 2 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Center frequency: $f_0 = 7.5\\,\\mathrm{MHz} = 7.5 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n- Speed of sound: $c = 1540\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n\nFirst, we compute the argument of the sinc function, let's call it $X$:\n$$\nX = \\frac{\\pi f_0 w \\sin(\\theta)}{c}\n$$\nWe use $\\sin(30^\\circ) = 0.5$. All other values are substituted in base SI units.\n$$\nX = \\frac{\\pi (7.5 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) (2 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}) (0.5)}{1540\\,\\mathrm{m/s}}\n$$\n$$\nX = \\frac{\\pi (7.5 \\times 10^6) (1 \\times 10^{-4})}{1540} = \\frac{750 \\pi}{1540} = \\frac{75 \\pi}{154}\n$$\nThis is the argument in radians. Numerically, $X \\approx 1.529995\\,\\mathrm{rad}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the element factor magnitude, which is $|\\text{sinc}(X)| = \\left|\\frac{\\sin(X)}{X}\\right|$:\n$$\nEF(30^\\circ) = \\left| \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{75\\pi}{154}\\right)}{\\frac{75\\pi}{154}} \\right|\n$$\n$$\nEF(30^\\circ) \\approx \\left| \\frac{\\sin(1.529995)}{1.529995} \\right| \\approx \\left| \\frac{0.999238}{1.529995} \\right| \\approx 0.65310\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the element factor magnitude is $0.653$.\n\n**Part 3: Discussion of Impact on Sensitivity**\n\nThe element factor, $EF(\\theta)$, represents the intrinsic directional sensitivity of a single element of the array. The overall beam pattern of a complete array is the product of the element factor and the array factor (which arises from the geometric arrangement and electronic phasing of all elements). The element factor thus acts as a modulating envelope on the array factor.\n\nOur calculation shows that at an angle of $\\theta = 30^\\circ$, the element factor magnitude is $EF(30^\\circ) \\approx 0.653$. This has direct consequences for the array's off-axis sensitivity:\n\n- **Amplitude Consideration:** The pressure amplitude of a wave transmitted or received at a $30^\\circ$ angle is weighted by this factor. This means the pressure amplitude of any signal, whether transmitted or received, at this angle is attenuated to approximately $65.3\\%$ of the maximum amplitude observed at broadside ($\\theta=0^\\circ$). This directly reduces the signal-to-noise ratio for targets located at this angle.\n\n- **Intensity Consideration:** Acoustic intensity is proportional to the square of the pressure amplitude ($I \\propto p^2$). Therefore, the intensity of the signal at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$ is reduced by a factor of $(EF(30^\\circ))^2$.\n$$\n\\text{Intensity Reduction Factor} = (0.653)^2 \\approx 0.426\n$$\nThis means that the acoustic power transmitted toward, or received from, the $30^\\circ$ direction is only about $42.6\\%$ of the power at broadside. In decibels, this corresponds to an intensity drop of $10 \\log_{10}(0.426) \\approx -3.7\\,\\mathrm{dB}$.\n\nIn conclusion, the element factor imposes a fundamental limitation on the useful field of view of a linear array. As the beam is steered further off-axis, the signal strength drops significantly due to this single-element diffraction effect, degrading image quality and limiting the effective steering range, independent of other effects like grating lobes.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.653}\n$$", "id": "4862710"}, {"introduction": "Building on the single-element concept, we now explore how an assembly of elements, or an aperture, works to form a focused beam.

The width $W_{\\mathrm{e}}$ spans $N_{\\mathrm{e}}-1$ intervals.\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{e}} = \\frac{W_{\\mathrm{e}}}{N_{\\mathrm{e}} - 1} = \\frac{2.2 \\ \\mathrm{mm}}{5 - 1} = \\frac{2.2 \\ \\mathrm{mm}}{4} = 0.55 \\ \\mathrm{mm} $$\nThe ratio $\\lambda_{0}/p_{\\mathrm{e}}$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda_{0}}{p_{\\mathrm{e}}} = \\frac{0.616 \\ \\mathrm{mm}}{0.55 \\ \\mathrm{mm}} = 1.12 $$\nThe largest steering magnitude, let's call it $\\theta_{\\mathrm{max}}$, is found at the boundary of our derived condition:\n$$ \\sin(\\theta_{\\mathrm{max}}) = \\frac{\\lambda_{0}}{p_{\\mathrm{e}}} - 1 $$\nPlugging in the calculated value for the ratio:\n$$ \\sin(\\theta_{\\mathrm{max}}) = 1.12 - 1 = 0.12 $$\nThe largest steering magnitude is therefore:\n$$ \\theta_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\arcsin(0.12) $$\nTo express this in degrees, we convert from radians:\n$$ \\theta_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\arcsin(0.12) \\times \\frac{180^{\\circ}}{\\pi} \\approx 6.8906^{\\circ} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the largest steering magnitude is $6.89^{\\circ}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.89}$$", "id": "4862725"}]}
