For a given tissue, the signal is a function of its intrinsic properties—proton density ($\\rho$), longitudinal relaxation time ($T_1$), and transverse relaxation time ($T_2$)—and the sequence parameters, primarily the Repetition Time ($TR$) and Echo Time ($TE$). The equation is:\n$$S = k \\cdot \\rho \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{TR}{T_1}\\right)\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{TE}{T_2}\\right)$$\nwhere $k$ is a proportionality constant that depends on the specifics of the scanner hardware and acquisition.\n\nThe problem describes a Proton Density (PD) weighted acquisition. The goal of PD-weighting is to create an image where the contrast is dominated by differences in proton density, $\\rho$, while minimizing contrast from differences in $T_1$ and $T_2$.
