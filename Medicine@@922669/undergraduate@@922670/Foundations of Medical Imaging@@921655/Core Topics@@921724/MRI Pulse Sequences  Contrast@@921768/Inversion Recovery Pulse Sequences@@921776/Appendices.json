This is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. Its general solution, describing $M_z$ as a function of time $t$, is:\n$$\nM_z(t) = M_0 + \\left( M_z(0) - M_0 \\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_1}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $M_z(0)$ is the initial magnetization at $t=0$.\n\nIn an inversion recovery sequence, the system is assumed to be at thermal equilibrium ($M_z = M_0$) before the sequence begins. A perfect inversion pulse rotates the magnetization vector by an angle of $\\pi$ radians ($180^\\circ$). This instantaneously inverts the longitudinal component of magnetization. Therefore, the initial condition for the recovery period, at time $t=0$ immediately after the pulse, is $M_z(0) = -M_0$.\n\nSubstituting this initial condition into the general solution gives the specific equation for recovery after a perfect inversion:\n$$\nM_z(t) = M_0 + \\left( -M_0 - M_0 \\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_1}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nM_z(t) = M_0 \\left( 1 - 2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_1}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nThe null time, $TI_{\\text{null}}$, is the time $t$ at which the longitudinal magnetization crosses zero, i.e., $M_z(TI_{\\text{null}}) = 0$.

We evaluate this magnitude in the two limiting cases.\n- From the analysis of option A, in the limit $T_1 \\to 0$, $M_z(TI) \\to M_0$. Thus, $|M_z(TI)| \\to |M_0| = M_0$.\n- From the analysis of option B, in the limit $T_1 \\to \\infty$, $M_z(TI) \\to -M_0$.

Therefore, both tissues with very short $T_1$ and very long $T_1$ will appear bright (high signal) in a magnitude-reconstructed image. The crucial information about the sign of the magnetization (positive for short $T_1$, negative for long $T_1$) is lost.\nThe statement is entirely correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. In a phase-sensitive reconstruction that preserves the sign of $M_z$, at a fixed finite $TI$ a tissue with $T_1 \\gg TI$ appears darker than a tissue with $T_1 \\ll TI$.**\n\nPhase-sensitive reconstruction produces a signal that is proportional to $M_z(TI)$, preserving its sign. \"Darker\" is typically interpreted as a lower value on the display intensity scale. Let's compare the signal values for the two tissue types.\n- For a tissue with $T_1 \\gg TI$: The ratio $\\frac{TI}{T_1}$ is very small. As shown in the analysis for option B, in the limit $T_1 \\to \\infty$, $M_z(TI) \\to -M_0$. This is a large negative value.\n- For a tissue with $T_1 \\ll TI$: The ratio $\\frac{TI}{T_1}$ is very large. As shown in the analysis for option A, in the limit $T_1 \\to 0$, $M_z(TI) \\to +M_0$. This is a large positive value.\nComparing the two signal values, $-M_0  +M_0$. A signal of $-M_0$ is algebraically smaller than a signal of $+M_0$. On a typical grayscale display where intensity is mapped monotonically from the signal value, the tissue with $T_1 \\gg TI$ (signal $\\approx -M_0$) would indeed be displayed as darker than the tissue with $T_1 \\ll TI$ (signal $\\approx +M_0$).\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**F. At fixed $TI$, the derivative $\\partial M_z(TI)/\\partial T_1$ is always positive, so increasing $T_1$ always increases $M_z(TI)$.**\n\nTo check this claim, we compute the partial derivative of $M_z(TI)$ with respect to $T_1$, treating $TI$ as a constant.\n$$\nM_z(TI) = M_0 \\left(1 - 2e^{-TI/T_1}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial M_z(TI)}{\\partial T_1} = M_0 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T_1} \\left(1 - 2e^{-TI \\cdot T_1^{-1}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial M_z(TI)}{\\partial T_1} = -2 M_0 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T_1} \\left(e^{-TI \\cdot T_1^{-1}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, where the derivative of the exponent is $\\frac{d}{dT_1} (-TI \\cdot T_1^{-1}) = -TI \\cdot (-1)T_1^{-2} = \\frac{TI}{T_1^2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial M_z(TI)}{\\partial T_1} = -2 M_0 \\left( e^{-TI/T_1} \\right) \\left( \\frac{TI}{T_1^2} \\right)\n$$\nAnalyzing the sign of this expression for physically relevant parameters ($M_00$, $TI0$, $T_10$):\n- $-2$ is negative.\n- $M_0$ is positive.\n- $e^{-TI/T_1}$ is positive.\n- $\\frac{TI}{T_1^2}$ is positive.\nThe product of these terms is therefore negative.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial M_z(TI)}{\\partial T_1}  0\n$$\nThe derivative is always negative, not positive. This means that increasing $T_1$ always *decreases* $M_z(TI)$. This is intuitive: a longer $T_1$ implies slower recovery from the inverted state, so at a fixed time $TI$, the magnetization will be at a lower (more negative or less positive) value.\nThe statement is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACDE}$$", "id": "4895336"}]}
