In FSE/TSE, a single radiofrequency excitation is followed by a train of refocusing pulses that generate multiple echoes; each echo is read out with a distinct phase-encoding gradient to sample different lines of $k$-space within one repetition period. Starting from the fundamental spin echo principle that one line of $k$-space is acquired per repetition in conventional Spin Echo (SE), and that multiple lines are acquired per repetition when multiple echoes are generated, define the FSE/TSE sequence structure and the key timing parameters.

In two-dimensional Fourier-transform magnetic resonance imaging, the total scan time is primarily determined by three parameters: the repetition time ($TR$), the number of phase-encoding steps ($N_y$), and the number of excitations or averages ($N_{\\mathrm{EX}}$). The number of phase-encoding steps is given by the matrix size in the phase-encoding dimension, which is $N_y = 256$ for the specified $256 \\times 256$ matrix.\n\nThe general expression for the total scan time ($T$) is given by the product of the repetition time and the number of times the sequence is repeated to fill $k$-space, multiplied by the number of averages:\n$$T = TR \\times (\\text{Number of Repetitions}) \\times N_{\\mathrm{EX}}$$\n\nFor a conventional Spin Echo (SE) sequence, a single $90^\\circ$ radiofrequency (RF) excitation pulse is followed by a single $180^\\circ$ refocusing pulse to generate one echo. This single echo is used to acquire data for one line of $k$-space. To acquire all $N_y$ lines in the phase-encoding dimension, the entire sequence must be repeated $N_y$ times, each with a different phase-encoding gradient. Therefore, the number of repetitions is equal to $N_y$.\n\nThe total scan time for a conventional SE sequence, $T_{\\mathrm{SE}}$, is thus:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{SE}} = TR \\times N_y \\times N_{\\mathrm{EX}}$$\n\nFor a Fast Spin Echo (FSE) or Turbo Spin Echo (TSE) sequence, a single $90^\\circ$ RF excitation pulse is followed by a train of $180^\\circ$ refocusing pulses. This train generates multiple echoes. The number of echoes in this train is defined as the Echo Train Length (ETL). Each echo is phase-encoded with a unique gradient strength, allowing the acquisition of multiple lines of $k$-space within a single repetition period ($TR$). The number of $k$-space lines acquired per $TR$ is equal to the ETL.\n\nTo acquire all $N_y$ lines of $k$-space, the number of repetitions needed is the total number of phase-encoding lines divided by the number of lines acquired per repetition.

This practice introduces the crucial concept of the effective echo time ($TE_{eff}$), which corresponds to the acquisition of the central k-space lines that define image contrast. By calculating the $TE_{eff}$ and relating it to tissue relaxation properties, you will learn how to predict the resulting image weighting and appearance [@problem_id:4884384].", "problem": "A magnetic resonance imaging acquisition uses a Fast Spin Echo (FSE), also known as Turbo Spin Echo (TSE), readout. The echo train is generated by a Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG) refocusing train with equal echo spacing. The sequence has echo train length $ETL = 16$ and echo spacing $\\Delta t = 7$ ms. Central $k$-space is acquired at echo index $n = 4$ using a centric ordering scheme.

Do not assume or use any proprietary sequence-specific contrast models; reason only from core relaxation principles and the role of the $k$-space center in image contrast formation.", "solution": "The solution is divided into two parts as requested: first, the derivation and calculation of the effective echo time, $TE_{eff}$, and second, the qualitative analysis of the resulting image contrast.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Effective Echo Time ($TE_{eff}$)**\n\nThe FSE/TSE sequence begins with a $90^{\\circ}$ excitation pulse at time $t=0$. This is followed by a train of $180^{\\circ}$ refocusing pulses to generate a series of spin echoes. In a CPMG sequence with equal echo spacing $\\Delta t$, the echoes are centered at integer multiples of $\\Delta t$.\n\nLet us establish the timing of the echoes. The first $180^{\\circ}$ refocusing pulse is applied at time $t = \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}$ after the excitation pulse. This pulse refocuses the transverse magnetization to form the first echo at time $TE_1 = \\Delta t$. The second $180^{\\circ}$ pulse is applied at time $t = \\Delta t + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}$, causing the second echo to form at time $TE_2 = 2\\Delta t$.\n\nIn general, for a series of refocusing pulses applied at times $(k - \\frac{1}{2})\\Delta t$ for $k=1, 2, 3, \\dots$, the $k$-th spin echo is formed precisely at time $TE_k = k \\Delta t$.\n\nThe problem defines the effective echo time, $TE_{eff}$, as the time interval from the initial $90^{\\circ}$ pulse ($t=0$) to the acquisition of the central line of $k$-space. This central region of $k$-space (containing the low spatial frequencies) is known to dominate the overall contrast and brightness of the final image.\n\nThe problem states that a centric ordering scheme is used and that the central $k$-space line is acquired at the echo with index $n$. Therefore, the time at which the crucial contrast information is encoded corresponds to the time of the $n$-th echo, $TE_n$.\n\nBased on the timing of the CPMG echo train, the time of the $n$-th echo is given by:\n$$TE_n = n \\Delta t$$\nBy the provided definition, this time is the effective echo time. Thus, the expression for $TE_{eff}$ is:\n$$TE_{eff} = n \\Delta t$$\nNow, we compute the value using the given parameters: $n = 4$ and $\\Delta t = 7$ ms.\n$$TE_{eff} = 4 \\times 7 \\, \\text{ms} = 28 \\, \\text{ms}$$\n\n**Part 2: Qualitative Contrast Analysis**\n\nThe contrast in the resulting magnitude image is determined by the signal intensity of different tissues, which, for a spin-echo-based sequence, is heavily influenced by $T_2$ decay. The signal intensity $S$ of a tissue at an echo time $TE$ can be described by the following proportionality, focusing on the $T_2$ relaxation component:\n$$S \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{TE}{T_2}\\right)$$\nAs established, the overall image contrast is dominated by the signal acquired at $TE_{eff}$. Therefore, the brightness of different tissues in the image will be governed by their respective signal intensities at $TE = TE_{eff} = 28$ ms.\n\n**Brightness of White Matter vs. Gray Matter:**\nWe are given the empirical fact that gray matter (GM) has a longer transverse relaxation time than white matter (WM) at clinical field strengths:\n$$T_{2, \\text{GM}} > T_{2, \\text{WM}}$$\nThis implies that the rate of decay is slower for gray matter. Mathematically, taking the reciprocal reverses the inequality:\n$$\\frac{1}{T_{2, \\text{GM}}} < \\frac{1}{T_{2, \\text{WM}}}$$\nMultiplying by the negative value $-TE_{eff}$ reverses the inequality again:\n$$-\\frac{TE_{eff}}{T_{2, \\text{GM}}} > -\\frac{TE_{eff}}{T_{2, \\text{WM}}}$$\nSince the exponential function, $\\exp(x)$, is a strictly increasing function of its argument $x$, it preserves the inequality:\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{TE_{eff}}{T_{2, \\text{GM}}}\\right) > \\exp\\left(-\\frac{TE_{eff}}{T_{2, \\text{WM}}}\\right)$$\nThis leads to the conclusion that the signal from gray matter, $S_{\\text{GM}}$, will be greater than the signal from white matter, $S_{\\text{WM}}$:\n$$S_{\\text{GM}} > S_{\\text{WM}}$$\nConsequently, **gray matter will appear brighter than white matter** in the resulting magnitude image.\n\n**Strength of the Contrast:**\nThe strength of the $T_2$ contrast depends on how effectively the chosen $TE_{eff}$ separates the signals from the two tissues. The signal difference is maximized at a specific echo time that is related to the $T_2$ values of the tissues being compared. Typical $T_2$ values for the human brain at clinical field strengths (e.g., $1.5$ T to $3$ T) are approximately $T_{2, \\text{WM}} \\approx 80$ ms and $T_{2, \\text{GM}} \\approx 100$ ms.\n\nFor these values, the echo time that maximizes the signal difference is approximately $90$ ms. A sequence designed for strong $T_2$-weighting would therefore use a $TE_{eff}$ in this range (e.g., $80-120$ ms).\n\nOur calculated $TE_{eff}$ is $28$ ms. This value is significantly shorter than the typical $T_2$ values of both tissues and also much shorter than the optimal echo time for maximizing their contrast. When $TE_{eff} \\ll T_2$, the exponential decay term $\\exp(-TE_{eff}/T_2)$ is close to $1$, and the signal difference between tissues is small. Such an image has limited $T_2$ contrast and is often referred to as having proton density (PD) weighting or intermediate weighting.\n\nTherefore, while gray matter will be visibly brighter than white matter, the difference in brightness will not be pronounced.

A shorter echo spacing reduces the time between the acquisition of successive phase-encoding lines. This means the entire $k$-space is traversed more quickly, minimizing the extent of $T_2$ decay across the echo train. Consequently, the signal attenuation difference between the center and the periphery of $k$-space is smaller, resulting in a flatter $k$-space envelope $W(k_y)$ and therefore a narrower, sharper PSF. This strategy is limited by hardware performance, specifically gradient strength and slew rate.\n2.  **Employ Variable Refocusing Flip Angles**: In a conventional FSE sequence, constant $180^\\circ$ refocusing pulses are used. However, this leads to signal decay governed by $T_2$. By using a train of refocusing pulses with varying flip angles (e.g., ramping from a low value up to a maximum near the center of the echo train and back down), it is possible to counteract the simple exponential decay and generate a pseudo-steady state of transverse magnetization. This flattens the signal amplitude profile across the echoes in the train. A flatter signal profile corresponds to a wider (less aggressive) $k$-space filter, which in the image domain translates to a sharper PSF and reduced blurring. This is a common technique in modern clinical FSE/TSE sequences.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.55}$$", "id": "4884359"}]}
