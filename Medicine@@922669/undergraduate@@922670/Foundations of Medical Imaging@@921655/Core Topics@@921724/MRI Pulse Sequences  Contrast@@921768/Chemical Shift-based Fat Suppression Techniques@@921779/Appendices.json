Assuming the phase is zero at time $t=0$, the phase at a later time $t$ is given by:\n$$ \\phi(t) = \\omega t $$\nIn MRI, the precession frequency is the Larmor frequency, which is proportional to the local magnetic field experienced by the nucleus. Due to differences in the molecular electronic environment, fat protons are shielded more effectively than water protons. This results in a slightly lower effective magnetic field for fat protons and thus a lower precession frequency.\n\nLet the angular precession frequencies of water and fat protons be $\\omega_W$ and $\\omega_F$, respectively. At time $t=0$, immediately following an radiofrequency (RF) excitation pulse, all spins are in phase. Their respective phases at a later time $t$ are:\n$$ \\phi_W(t) = \\omega_W t $$\n$$ \\phi_F(t) = \\omega_F t $$\nThe relative phase difference $\\Delta \\phi(t)$ between the water and fat magnetization vectors is the difference between their individual phases:\n$$ \\Delta \\phi(t) = \\phi_W(t) - \\phi_F(t) = (\\omega_W - \\omega_F) t $$\nThis can be written in terms of the difference in angular frequency, $\\Delta \\omega = \\omega_W - \\omega_F$:\n$$ \\Delta \\phi(t) = \\Delta \\omega \\cdot t $$\nThe relationship between angular frequency $\\omega$ (in radians per second) and cyclical frequency $f$ (in Hertz) is $\\omega = 2\\pi f$. Therefore, the difference in angular frequency can be expressed using the difference in cyclical frequency, $\\Delta f = f_W - f_F$:\n$$ \\Delta \\omega = 2\\pi \\Delta f $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the relative phase difference gives:\n$$ \\Delta \\phi(t) = 2\\pi \\Delta f \\cdot t $$\nWe are asked to find the time $t$ at which the water and fat signals are exactly opposed in phase.

The echo time, denoted as TE, is the time from the center of the RF excitation pulse to the center of the acquired echo. By setting the TE of a gradient-echo sequence equal to the time $t$ we just calculated, the data is acquired precisely when the water and fat signals are opposed in phase. This technique is known as **opposed-phase imaging** (or out-of-phase imaging).\n\nIn a voxel containing a mixture of water and fat, the net signal acquired at an opposed-phase TE will be proportional to the magnitude of the difference between the water signal ($S_W$) and the fat signal ($S_F$), i.e., $|S_W - S_F|$. This signal cancellation at boundaries between fatty and non-fatty tissues creates a characteristic dark boundary artifact, often called the \"India ink\" or \"black boundary\" artifact. This effect is a powerful diagnostic tool. For example, it is used to detect microscopic (intracytoplasmic) fat in tissues, which is a key feature for diagnosing hepatic steatosis (fatty liver) or for distinguishing lipid-rich adrenal adenomas from other adrenal masses.\n\nConversely, if the TE is set to a time when water and fat are back in phase, the signals add constructively. The first time this occurs is at $t' = 2t = \\frac{1}{\\Delta f}$. At this TE, the relative phase is $2\\pi$ radians ($360^{\\circ}$), and the net signal is proportional to the sum of the individual signals, $S_W + S_F$. This is known as **in-phase imaging**. By acquiring two separate gradient-echo images, one at an opposed-phase TE and one at an in-phase TE, clinicians can visually identify and even quantify the amount of fat in a tissue. This dual-echo chemical shift imaging technique is a cornerstone of abdominal and body MRI. The choice of TE is therefore a fundamental parameter that directly controls the fat-related contrast in the final image.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.326}$$", "id": "4867838"}, {"introduction": "Moving from passively observing phase differences, we can actively manipulate spins to suppress unwanted signals.

We follow the process step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Initial State**: Prior to the inversion pulse, the fat magnetization is at thermal equilibrium. The longitudinal component is $M_z(0^{-}) = M_0^{\\mathrm{fat}}$, and we assume the transverse components are zero. The magnetization vector is $\\mathbf{M}(0^{-}) = (0, 0, M_0^{\\mathrm{fat}})$.\n\n2.  **Effect of the RF Pulse**: The spectrally selective RF pulse is designed to invert the fat magnetization.

This \"presaturation\" pulse selectively excites the fat spins, tipping their longitudinal magnetization into the transverse plane. Immediately following this pulse, magnetic field gradients, known as \"spoilers,\" are applied to dephase this transverse magnetization, effectively destroying it. This process aims to set the longitudinal magnetization of fat to zero while leaving the water magnetization untouched at its equilibrium value.\n\nThe degradation of this technique in a voxel containing both fat and water (a partial volume voxel) arises from the physical impossibility of creating a perfectly frequency-selective RF pulse. Any real RF pulse, such as the specified Gaussian pulse, has a finite bandwidth and non-zero energy at frequencies away from its center frequency.\n\nIn a mixed voxel, the water protons precess at a frequency offset, $\\Delta f$, from the fat protons. Although the CHESS pulse is centered on the fat resonance, its spectral \"tails\" will inevitably deliver some RF energy to the water spins. Consequently, the water spins experience a small but non-zero flip angle. This unwanted excitation tips a portion of the water's longitudinal magnetization away from the main magnetic field axis. While the fat magnetization is ideally nulled, the water magnetization is also reduced from its full equilibrium value. Spoiling dephases any transverse component of water magnetization created, but the reduction in its longitudinal component persists.\n\nTherefore, when the subsequent imaging excitation pulse is applied, the available longitudinal magnetization for water is already diminished. This leads to a weaker water signal than would be obtained in the absence of the CHESS pulse. The degradation, in this context, is the non-specific suppression of the desired water signal, which compromises the primary goal of isolating the water signal by exclusively removing the fat signal.\n\n**Part 2: Quantitative Estimation**\nThe goal is to compute the ratio of the total voxel signal with CHESS presaturation to the signal without it. The signal immediately after an imaging excitation of flip angle $\\alpha$ is proportional to the transverse magnetization, $M_{xy}$. For a given spin population with longitudinal magnetization $M_z$ just prior to the pulse, the resulting transverse magnetization is $M_{xy} = M_z \\sin(\\alpha)$. We assume the initial signals from fat and water add constructively.\n\nLet $M_0$ be the equilibrium magnetization of a full voxel of reference tissue. Given equal proton density, the equilibrium magnetizations for the fat and water components in the mixed voxel are $M_{0,\\mathrm{fat}} = f_{\\mathrm{fat}} M_0$ and $M_{0,\\mathrm{water}} = f_{\\mathrm{water}} M_0$, where $f_{\\mathrm{fat}} = 0.3$ and $f_{\\mathrm{water}} = 0.7$.\n\n**Signal without CHESS ($S_{\\text{no-CHESS}}$)**\nWithout any presaturation pulse, both fat and water are at full thermal equilibrium before the imaging excitation.\nThe total longitudinal magnetization is $M_{z,\\text{total}} = M_{0,\\mathrm{fat}} + M_{0,\\mathrm{water}} = (f_{\\mathrm{fat}} + f_{\\mathrm{water}})M_0 = M_0$.\nThe total transverse signal after the imaging pulse is proportional to $M_{0} \\sin(\\alpha)$.\n$$ S_{\\text{no-CHESS}} \\propto M_0 \\sin(\\alpha) $$\n\n**Signal with CHESS ($S_{\\text{CHESS}}$)**\nWe must calculate the longitudinal magnetization for both fat and water components just before the imaging pulse, after they have been affected by the CHESS pulse and have undergone partial longitudinal relaxation during the delay time $t_d$.\n\n**Fat Component:**\nThe CHESS pulse is centered on the fat resonance ($f=0$), so fat spins experience the center flip angle $\\theta_0 = 90^{\\circ} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians.
