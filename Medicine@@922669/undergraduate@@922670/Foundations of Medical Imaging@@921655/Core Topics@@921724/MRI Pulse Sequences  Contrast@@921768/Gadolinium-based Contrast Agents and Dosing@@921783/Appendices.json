Let's model the evolution of the longitudinal magnetization $M_z$ over one repetition time, $TR$.\n\nLet $M_{z}^{-}$ be the longitudinal magnetization just before an RF pulse and $M_{z}^{+}$ be the magnetization just after the pulse. The RF pulse with flip angle $\\alpha$ rotates the magnetization, so the component remaining along the z-axis is:\n$$\nM_{z}^{+} = M_{z}^{-} \\cos\\alpha\n$$\nFollowing the pulse, the longitudinal magnetization recovers towards its equilibrium value $M_0$ over the time interval $TR$. The governing equation is given as $M_{z}(\\Delta t) = M_{0} - (M_{0} - M_{z}(0))\\exp(-\\Delta t/T_{1})$. Here, the initial magnetization is $M_{z}(0) = M_{z}^{+}$ and the time interval is $\\Delta t = TR$. At the end of this interval, the magnetization will be equal to the magnetization before the next pulse, $M_z^{-}$. This is the steady-state condition.\n$$\nM_{z}^{-} = M_{0} - (M_{0} - M_{z}^{+}) \\exp(-TR/T_{1})\n$$\nSubstituting $M_{z}^{+} = M_{z}^{-} \\cos\\alpha$ into the steady-state recovery equation:\n$$\nM_{z}^{-} = M_{0} - (M_{0} - M_{z}^{-} \\cos\\alpha) \\exp(-TR/T_{1})\n$$\nWe need to solve this equation for $M_{z}^{-}$.

Thus, the signal as a function of the flip angle $\\alpha$ is:\n$$\nS(\\alpha) \\propto M_{z}^{-} \\sin\\alpha = M_{0} \\frac{(1 - \\exp(-TR/T_{1})) \\sin\\alpha}{1 - \\cos\\alpha \\exp(-TR/T_{1})}\n$$\nTo find the optimal flip angle, $\\alpha_{opt}$, that maximizes this signal, we need to take the derivative of $S(\\alpha)$ with respect to $\\alpha$ and set it to zero. The terms $M_{0}$ and $(1 - \\exp(-TR/T_{1}))$ are constant with respect to $\\alpha$, so we only need to maximize the function:\n$$\nf(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\sin\\alpha}{1 - \\cos\\alpha \\exp(-TR/T_{1})}\n$$\nFor simplification, let $E_{1} = \\exp(-TR/T_{1})$.
