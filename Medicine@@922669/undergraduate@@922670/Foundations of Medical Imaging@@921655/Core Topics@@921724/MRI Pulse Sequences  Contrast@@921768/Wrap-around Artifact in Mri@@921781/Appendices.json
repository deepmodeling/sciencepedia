The solution will proceed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe derivation begins with the Larmor equation, which relates the precession frequency $f$ of a spin to the magnetic field strength $B$ it experiences:\n$$\nf = \\gamma B\n$$\nHere, $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio. In the context of frequency encoding along the $x$-axis, a linear magnetic field gradient $G_x$ is applied in addition to the main static magnetic field $B_0$. The total magnetic field at a position $x$ is therefore:\n$$\nB(x) = B_0 + G_x x\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Larmor equation gives the position-dependent Larmor frequency:\n$$\nf(x) = \\gamma (B_0 + G_x x) = \\gamma B_0 + \\gamma G_x x\n$$\nThe term $f_0 = \\gamma B_0$ is the central frequency at the isocenter ($x=0$) of the magnet. In signal reception, the signal is demodulated by this central frequency $f_0$. This process removes the large, constant frequency component, leaving only the frequency offset $\\Delta f(x)$ that is dependent on spatial position:\n$$\n\\Delta f(x) = f(x) - f_0 = \\gamma G_x x\n$$\nThis fundamental equation of frequency encoding shows that the frequency offset is linearly proportional to the spatial position $x$.\n\nThe Field of View in the readout direction, $\\mathrm{FOV}_x$, is the total spatial width that the system can image without ambiguity. Let this spatial extent be centered at $x=0$, so it spans from $x = -\\frac{\\mathrm{FOV}_x}{2}$ to $x = +\\frac{\\mathrm{FOV}_x}{2}$. The range of frequencies corresponding to this spatial FOV is the signal bandwidth, $BW$. The bandwidth is the difference between the maximum and minimum frequency offsets:\n$$\nBW = \\Delta f\\left(+\\frac{\\mathrm{FOV}_x}{2}\\right) - \\Delta f\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{FOV}_x}{2}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta f(x)$:\n$$\nBW = \\left(\\gamma G_x \\frac{\\mathrm{FOV}_x}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\gamma G_x \\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{FOV}_x}{2}\\right)\\right) = \\gamma G_x \\frac{\\mathrm{FOV}_x}{2} + \\gamma G_x \\frac{\\mathrm{FOV}_x}{2}\n$$\n$$\nBW = \\gamma G_x \\mathrm{FOV}_x\n$$\nAccording to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, to unambiguously represent a signal with a bandwidth $BW$, the sampling frequency $f_s$ must be at least equal to $BW$. In MRI, the sampling frequency (often called the receiver bandwidth) is set to define the FOV for a given gradient strength. Therefore, we set the signal bandwidth equal to the sampling frequency:\n$$\nf_s = BW = \\gamma G_x \\mathrm{FOV}_x\n$$\nSolving for $\\mathrm{FOV}_x$ gives the desired relationship:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FOV}_x = \\frac{f_s}{\\gamma G_x}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $\\mathrm{FOV}_x$ using the given parameters. First, we must ensure all units are consistent within the SI system.\nGiven:\n$\\gamma = 42.58\\,\\mathrm{MHz/T} = 42.58 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz/T}$\n$G_x = 20\\,\\mathrm{mT/m} = 20 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{T/m}$\n$f_s = 200\\,\\mathrm{kHz} = 200 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FOV}_x = \\frac{200 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{Hz}}{(42.58 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz/T}) \\times (20 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{T/m})}\n$$\nThe units simplify as $\\frac{\\mathrm{Hz}}{(\\mathrm{Hz/T}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{T/m})} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Hz}}{\\mathrm{Hz/m}} = \\mathrm{m}$, so the result is in meters.\n$$\n\\mathrm{FOV}_x = \\frac{200 \\times 10^3}{42.58 \\times 20 \\times 10^3}\\,\\mathrm{m} = \\frac{200}{851.6}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\approx 0.234852043\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in centimeters. We convert meters to centimeters by multiplying by $100$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FOV}_x \\approx 23.4852043\\,\\mathrm{cm}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FOV}_x \\approx 23.49\\,\\mathrm{cm}\n$$\nThe final step is to determine if an object of width $28\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ will wrap (alias). Aliasing occurs when the object size is larger than the Field of View. We compare the object width to the calculated $\\mathrm{FOV}_x$:\nObject width$= 28\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n$\\mathrm{FOV}_x = 23.49\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n\nSince $28\\,\\mathrm{cm} > 23.49\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, the object is larger than the field of view. Therefore, the parts of the object outside the FOV will be aliased and wrap around into the image. The wrap indicator is $1$.\n\nThe final answer is a two-entry row matrix containing the calculated $\\mathrm{FOV}_x$ in cm and the wrap indicator.\nFirst entry: $\\mathrm{FOV}_x = 23.49$\nSecond entry: Wrap indicator $= 1$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n23.49 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4941715"}, {"introduction": "Having established the condition for aliasing, we now explore its mathematical origins to understand precisely how and where the artifact appears.

These are all standard, scientifically correct tenets of Fourier imaging and signal processing. The problem is self-contained, well-posed, and uses objective, formal language. It is a valid problem in the foundations of medical imaging.\n\nWe proceed with the solution, which is divided into three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the periodic tiling of the reconstructed image.\n\nThe continuous signal in $k$-space is $s(k_x)$. Sampling this signal at discrete points $k_n = n \\Delta k_x$ for all integers $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ can be modeled mathematically by multiplying the continuous signal by a Dirac comb function. The sampled signal, $s_{\\text{samp}}(k_x)$, is given by:\n$$\ns_{\\text{samp}}(k_x) = s(k_x) \\cdot \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(k_x - n \\Delta k_x)\n$$\nwhere $\\delta(\\cdot)$ is the Dirac delta function.\n\nThe image is reconstructed by taking the inverse Fourier transform of this sampled signal. Let the reconstructed image be $\\rho_{\\text{rec}}(x)$. The inverse Fourier transform operation is defined as $\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{S(k_x)\\} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} S(k_x) \\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\,2\\pi\\,k_x\\,x)\\,dk_x$.\nApplying the convolution theorem, the inverse Fourier transform of a product of two functions is the convolution of their individual inverse Fourier transforms:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\text{rec}}(x) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{s_{\\text{samp}}(k_x)\\} = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{s(k_x)\\} * \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\left\\{\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(k_x - n \\Delta k_x)\\right\\}\n$$\nThe first term is the inverse transform of the original $k$-space signal, which by definition yields the true spin density:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{s(k_x)\\} = \\rho(x)\n$$\nThe second term is the inverse Fourier transform of the Dirac comb in $k$-space. Let's compute it:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\left\\{\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(k_x - n \\Delta k_x)\\right\\} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left(\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(k_x - n \\Delta k_x)\\right) \\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\,2\\pi\\,k_x\\,x)\\,dk_x\n$$\nBy linearity and the sifting property of the delta function, this becomes:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(k_x - n \\Delta k_x) \\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\,2\\pi\\,k_x\\,x)\\,dk_x = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\,2\\pi\\,(n \\Delta k_x)\\,x)\n$$\nUsing the given relation $L = \\frac{1}{\\Delta k_x}$, the expression is $\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\,2\\pi\\,n\\,\\frac{x}{L})$. This is a Fourier series which represents another Dirac comb, but in the spatial domain $x$. The relevant identity, a consequence of the Poisson summation formula, is:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(\\mathrm{i}\\,2\\pi\\,n\\,\\frac{x}{L}\\right) = L \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(x - m L)\n$$\nNow we can substitute these results back into the convolution expression for $\\rho_{\\text{rec}}(x)$:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\text{rec}}(x) = \\rho(x) * \\left(L \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(x - m L)\\right)\n$$\nConvolution with a shifted delta function $\\delta(x-a)$ results in a shift of the original function: $f(x) * \\delta(x-a) = f(x-a)$. Applying this to our sum:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\text{rec}}(x) = L \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\rho(x) * \\delta(x - m L) = L \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\rho(x - m L)\n$$\nThis result shows that the reconstructed image $\\rho_{\\text{rec}}(x)$ is a superposition of infinitely many copies of the true spin density $\\rho(x)$, each shifted by an integer multiple $m$ of the FOV length $L$. This constitutes a periodic tiling of the true spin density with spatial period $L$. The scaling factor $L$ can be absorbed into the overall image intensity scaling.\n\nPart 2: Deduction of the mapping rule.\n\nThe MRI system displays the reconstructed image $\\rho_{\\text{rec}}(x)$ over a finite window, the Field of View, which corresponds to one period of the tiled function. The problem specifies this as the principal interval $[0, L)$.\n\nConsider a point source of spin density at a true position $x_{\\text{true}}$. In our model, this corresponds to $\\rho(x) = \\delta(x - x_{\\text{true}})$. According to the tiling derivation, the reconstructed image would be proportional to:\n$$\n\\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(x - x_{\\text{true}} - m L)\n$$\nThis means the single point at $x_{\\text{true}}$ is replicated at all locations $x = x_{\\text{true}} + m L$ for $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nWhen this infinite set of replicated points is viewed within the display window $[0, L)$, we see only the point(s) that \"fold\" or \"wrap around\" into this interval. Let the displayed position be $x_{\\text{disp}}$. For any true position $x_{\\text{true}}$, its displayed position $x_{\\text{disp}}$ must satisfy two conditions:\n1. $x_{\\text{disp}} \\in [0, L)$\n2. $x_{\\text{disp}} = x_{\\text{true}} + m L$ for some integer $m$.\n\nThese two conditions define the modulo operation. The displayed position is the true position modulo the Field of View length $L$.\n$$\nx_{\\text{disp}} = x_{\\text{true}} \\pmod{L}\n$$\nThis mapping rule can be expressed analytically using the floor function $\\lfloor \\cdot \\rfloor$, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to its argument. For any real number $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we can write $x = kL + r$, where $k = \\lfloor x/L \\rfloor$ is an integer and $r$ is the remainder such that $0 \\le r < L$. The displayed position $x_{\\text{disp}}$ is this remainder $r$.\nThus, the mapping rule is:\n$$\nx_{\\text{disp}} = x_{\\text{true}} - L \\cdot \\lfloor x_{\\text{true}}/L \\rfloor\n$$\n\nPart 3: Application of the mapping rule.\n\nWe apply the derived rule to the three given true positions $x = \\{1.2\\,L, 1.6\\,L, 2.3\\,L\\}$.\n\nFor the first point, $x_{\\text{true},1} = 1.2\\,L$:\n$$\nx_{\\text{disp},1} = 1.2\\,L - L \\cdot \\lfloor (1.2\\,L)/L \\rfloor = 1.2\\,L - L \\cdot \\lfloor 1.2 \\rfloor = 1.2\\,L - L \\cdot 1 = 0.2\\,L\n$$\n\nFor the second point, $x_{\\text{true},2} = 1.6\\,L$:\n$$\nx_{\\text{disp},2} = 1.6\\,L - L \\cdot \\lfloor (1.6\\,L)/L \\rfloor = 1.6\\,L - L \\cdot \\lfloor 1.6 \\rfloor = 1.6\\,L - L \\cdot 1 = 0.6\\,L\n$$\n\nFor the third point, $x_{\\text{true},3} = 2.3\\,L$:\n$$\nx_{\\text{disp},3} = 2.3\\,L - L \\cdot \\lfloor (2.3\\,L)/L \\rfloor = 2.3\\,L - L \\cdot \\lfloor 2.3 \\rfloor = 2.3\\,L - L \\cdot 2 = 0.3\\,L\n$$\n\nThe displayed positions are $0.2\\,L$, $0.6\\,L$, and $0.3\\,L$.

The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe core principle of Fourier imaging, as applied in MRI, is that the spatial distribution of the object, $\\rho(y)$, and its signal in spatial frequency space (k-space), $S(k_y)$, form a Fourier transform pair. In a discrete acquisition, the k-space signal is sampled at discrete intervals, $\\Delta k_y$. The inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) of this sampled data yields the reconstructed image.\n\nA fundamental property of the discrete Fourier transform is that sampling in one domain (k-space) leads to periodic replication in the conjugate domain (image space). The period of this replication in the image space is the field of view, $\\mathrm{FOV}_y$, which is determined by the k-space sampling interval:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FOV}_y = \\frac{1}{\\Delta k_y}\n$$\nThe reconstructed image profile, $\\rho_{rec}(y')$, within the primary FOV (typically for $y' \\in [-\\mathrm{FOV}_y/2, \\mathrm{FOV}_y/2]$) is therefore a superposition of the true object profile, $\\rho(y)$, shifted by integer multiples of the FOV. This can be expressed as an infinite sum:\n$$\n\\rho_{rec}(y') = \\sum_{j=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\rho(y' + j \\cdot \\mathrm{FOV}_y)\n$$\nwhere $y'$ is a coordinate within the reconstructed image's FOV. This phenomenon is known as aliasing or wrap-around. The problem states that the measured magnitude at a pixel is the sum of contributions from all locations that fold into that pixel. Assuming $\\rho_0$ is a real, non-negative quantity and receiver sensitivity is uniform, the measured magnitude (intensity) $I(y')$ is equal to $\\rho_{rec}(y')$.\n\nThe object is a uniform slab of spin density $\\rho_0$ and width $W_y$, centered at $y=0$. Its profile is:\n$$\n\\rho(y) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\rho_0 & \\text{if } |y| \\le \\frac{W_y}{2} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } |y| > \\frac{W_y}{2}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe intensity at an image pixel $y'$ is thus:\n$$\nI(y') = \\sum_{j=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\rho(y' + j \\cdot \\mathrm{FOV}_y)\n$$\nA term in this sum is non-zero only if its argument falls within the spatial extent of the object. That is, the $j$-th term contributes to the sum if and only if:\n$$\n\\left| y' + j \\cdot \\mathrm{FOV}_y \\right| \\le \\frac{W_y}{2}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the number of overlapping copies contributing to a pixel \"well inside the folded region\". This condition implies we should analyze a point where edge effects from the FOV boundaries are not a factor, and the number of overlaps is maximal. The center of the image, $y' = 0$, satisfies this condition.\n\nFor the central pixel, $y' = 0$, the condition for a non-zero contribution from the $j$-th replica simplifies to:\n$$\n|j \\cdot \\mathrm{FOV}_y| \\le \\frac{W_y}{2}\n$$\n$$\n|j| \\le \\frac{W_y}{2 \\cdot \\mathrm{FOV}_y}\n$$\nThe number of distinct overlapping copies, $N_{copies}$, is the number of integer values of $j$ that satisfy this inequality. The integers $j$ range from $-\\left\\lfloor \\frac{W_y}{2 \\cdot \\mathrm{FOV}_y} \\right\\rfloor$ to $+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{W_y}{2 \\cdot \\mathrm{FOV}_y} \\right\\rfloor$. The total count of these integers is:\n$$\nN_{copies} = 2 \\left\\lfloor \\frac{W_y}{2 \\cdot \\mathrm{FOV}_y} \\right\\rfloor + 1\n$$\nThis formula represents, from first principles, the number of distinct copies that contribute to the signal at the center of the FOV.\n\nThe intensity at the central pixel, $I(0)$, is the sum of the densities from all these contributing locations. Since the object has a uniform density $\\rho_0$, and each of the $N_{copies}$ contributing locations falls within the object slab, each contributes a value of $\\rho_0$. Therefore, the total intensity is:\n$$\nI(0) = N_{copies} \\cdot \\rho_0 = \\left( 2 \\left\\lfloor \\frac{W_y}{2 \\cdot \\mathrm{FOV}_y} \\right\\rfloor + 1 \\right) \\rho_0\n$$\nNow, we substitute the specific parameters provided:\n- $W_y = 380\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- $\\mathrm{FOV}_y = 140\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- $\\rho_0 = 0.90\\,\\mathrm{a.u.}$\n\nFirst, we compute the argument of the floor function:\n$$\n\\frac{W_y}{2 \\cdot \\mathrm{FOV}_y} = \\frac{380}{2 \\cdot 140} = \\frac{380}{280} = \\frac{19}{14} \\approx 1.35714\n$$\nNext, we evaluate the floor of this value:\n$$\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{19}{14} \\right\\rfloor = \\lfloor 1.35714... \\rfloor = 1\n$$\nUsing this result, we find the number of overlapping copies:\n$$\nN_{copies} = 2(1) + 1 = 3\n$$\nThis means that the central part of the object ($j=0$), plus two aliased parts corresponding to $j=1$ and $j=-1$, contribute to the signal at the center of the reconstructed image.\n\nFinally, we compute the measured magnitude at $y=0$:\n$$\nI(0) = N_{copies} \\cdot \\rho_0 = 3 \\cdot 0.90\\,\\mathrm{a.u.} = 2.7\\,\\mathrm{a.u.}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nI(0) = 2.700\\,\\mathrm{a.u.}\n$$\nThe number of additional wraps, $n$, would be $n = N_{copies} - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$, but this is not the requested final answer. The requested final answer is the numerical intensity at $y=0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2.700}\n$$", "id": "4941760"}]}
