According to the problem statement, we are to consider only the effects of transverse relaxation. The initial transverse magnetization immediately following the radiofrequency excitation pulse is assumed to be identical for both sequences. Let us denote this initial signal magnitude as $S_0$.\n\nFor a Spin Echo (SE) sequence, the $180$-degree refocusing pulse at time $TE/2$ reverses the dephasing of spins caused by static magnetic field inhomogeneities. Consequently, at the echo time $TE$, the signal decay is governed solely by the irreversible spin-spin relaxation, characterized by the time constant $T_2$.

The evolution of longitudinal magnetization $M_z$ is governed by the Bloch equation, which, in the absence of RF pulses, is:\n$$\n\\frac{dM_z}{dt} = \\frac{M_0 - M_z}{T_1}\n$$\nwhere $M_0$ is the equilibrium magnetization and $T_1$ is the longitudinal relaxation time. The solution to this differential equation describes the recovery of $M_z$ over a time interval $t$:\n$$\nM_z(t) = M_0 + (M_z(0) - M_0) \\exp(-t/T_1)\n$$\nIn an SPGR sequence, this recovery occurs over the repetition time $TR$. Let $M_z^{ss,-}$ be the longitudinal magnetization just before an RF pulse in the steady state. The RF pulse, with flip angle $\\alpha$, rotates this magnetization, so the longitudinal component immediately after the pulse is $M_z^{ss,+} = M_z^{ss,-} \\cos(\\alpha)$. This magnetization then recovers for a duration $TR$. The magnetization at the end of this period is:\n$$\nM_z(TR) = M_0 + (M_z^{ss,+} - M_0) \\exp(-TR/T_1) = M_0 + (M_z^{ss,-} \\cos(\\alpha) - M_0) \\exp(-TR/T_1)\n$$\nIn the steady state, the magnetization at the end of one cycle must equal the magnetization at the beginning of the next, i.e., $M_z(TR) = M_z^{ss,-}$. Let's denote $M_z^{ss,-}$ simply as $M_z^{ss}$.\n$$\nM_z^{ss} = M_0 + (M_z^{ss} \\cos(\\alpha) - M_0) \\exp(-TR/T_1)\n$$\nWe solve for $M_z^{ss}$:\n$$\nM_z^{ss} (1 - \\cos(\\alpha) \\exp(-TR/T_1)) = M_0 (1 - \\exp(-TR/T_1))\n$$\n$$\nM_z^{ss} = M_0 \\frac{1 - \\exp(-TR/T_1)}{1 - \\cos(\\alpha) \\exp(-TR/T_1)}\n$$\nThe signal in a gradient echo sequence is proportional to the transverse magnetization, $M_{xy}$. The RF pulse creates a transverse component $M_{xy} = M_z^{ss} \\sin(\\alpha)$. This transverse magnetization then decays with the effective transverse relaxation time $T_2^*$. The signal $S$ is measured at echo time $TE$, so it is proportional to $M_{xy}(TE)$:\n$$\nS(\\alpha, T_1) \\propto M_z^{ss} \\sin(\\alpha) \\exp(-TE/T_2^*)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $M_z^{ss}$:\n$$\nS(\\alpha, T_1) = K \\cdot M_0 \\frac{(1 - \\exp(-TR/T_1)) \\sin(\\alpha)}{1 - \\cos(\\alpha) \\exp(-TR/T_1)} \\exp(-TE/T_2^*)\n$$\nwhere $K$ is a proportionality constant related to receiver gain and proton density.\n\nNext, we explain how increasing $\\alpha$ enhances sensitivity to $T_1$ differences ($T_1$-weighting). The signal depends on $T_1$ through the term $E_1 = \\exp(-TR/T_1)$. A shorter $T_1$ leads to a smaller $E_1$. Saturation refers to the reduction of the steady-state longitudinal magnetization $M_z^{ss}$. From its expression, as $\\alpha$ increases from $0$ towards $\\pi/2$, $\\cos(\\alpha)$ decreases from $1$ towards $0$. This increases the denominator $(1 - E_1 \\cos(\\alpha))$, thus decreasing $M_z^{ss}$. A larger flip angle therefore causes greater saturation.\n\nThis saturation effect is more pronounced for tissues with longer $T_1$ values. A tissue with a long $T_1$ has an $E_1$ value closer to $1$, so it recovers less of its longitudinal magnetization during $TR$. When a large flip angle $\\alpha$ is applied, it tips away a large fraction of this already poorly-recovered magnetization. A tissue with a short $T_1$ recovers more quickly and can sustain a larger $M_z^{ss}$ even with a large flip angle. Consequently, the difference in signal between tissues with different $T_1$ values becomes more pronounced at larger flip angles (up to the Ernst angle). This enhancement of signal difference based on $T_1$ is what is meant by increasing $T_1$-weighting.\n\nNow, we evaluate the relative contrast $C(\\alpha)$ and compute its change $\\Delta C$.\nThe relative contrast is defined as:\n$$\nC(\\alpha) = \\frac{S_A(\\alpha) - S_B(\\alpha)}{S_A(\\alpha) + S_B(\\alpha)}\n$$\nThe common factors $K$, $M_0$, and $\\exp(-TE/T_2^*)$ cancel. Let $E_{1,A} = \\exp(-TR/T_{1,A})$ and $E_{1,B} = \\exp(-TR/T_{1,B})$.
