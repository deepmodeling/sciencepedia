The static main magnetic field is denoted by $B_0$. The echo time is denoted by $TE$, the irreversible spin-spin relaxation time by $T_2$, and the effective transverse relaxation time that includes reversible dephasing from $B_0$ inhomogeneity by $T_2^*$. Assume identical proton density and equilibrium magnetization across measurements, a long repetition time so that longitudinal recovery does not impose additional weighting, perfect refocusing pulses for the SE sequence, no diffusion effects, and that the initial transverse magnetization immediately prior to relaxation is the same for both sequences so that only transverse decay contributes to the signal ratio.\n\nStarting from the following foundational principles:\n1) The Bloch equation describes transverse relaxation with time constant $T_2$ due to irreversible spin-spin interactions.\n2) Reversible phase dispersion from static off-resonance caused by $B_0$ inhomogeneity is refocused by a Hahn spin echo at the echo time, but is not refocused in a gradient echo, and this ensemble dephasing can be represented by an effective time constant $T_2^*$.\n3) The measured gradient-recalled echo signal at time $TE$ is governed by the combined irreversible and reversible dephasing, whereas the spin echo at $TE$ removes the reversible component and is governed only by $T_2$.\n\nDerive an expression for the ratio of signal magnitudes at the echo time, $S_{\\mathrm{GRE}}/S_{\\mathrm{SE}}$, in terms of $TE$, $T_2$, and $T_2^*$, and then evaluate this ratio for $TE=30\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, $T_2=80\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, and $T_2^*=50\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.

According to the problem statement, we are to consider only the effects of transverse relaxation. The initial transverse magnetization immediately following the radiofrequency excitation pulse is assumed to be identical for both sequences. Let us denote this initial signal magnitude as $S_0$.\n\nFor a Spin Echo (SE) sequence, the $180$-degree refocusing pulse at time $TE/2$ reverses the dephasing of spins caused by static magnetic field inhomogeneities. Consequently, at the echo time $TE$, the signal decay is governed solely by the irreversible spin-spin relaxation, characterized by the time constant $T_2$.
