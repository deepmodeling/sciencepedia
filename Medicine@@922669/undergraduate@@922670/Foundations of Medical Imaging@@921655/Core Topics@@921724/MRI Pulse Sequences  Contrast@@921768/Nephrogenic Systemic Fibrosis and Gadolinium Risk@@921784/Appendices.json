It is scientifically grounded in the principles of pharmacokinetics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objectively phrased. The problem requires a first-principles-based derivation and subsequent calculation, which is a standard and rigorous academic exercise in this field.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts: first, the derivation of the half-life ($t_{1/2}$) formula from the core definitions, and second, the calculation of $t_{1/2}$ for the specified patient and renal function levels.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Plasma Half-Life Expression\n\nWe begin with the three foundational definitions provided. Let $A(t)$ be the amount of the gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) in the body's single compartment at time $t$, and let $C(t)$ be its concentration in plasma.\n\n1.  The definition of the volume of distribution, $V_d$, relates the amount of drug to its plasma concentration:\n    $$A(t) = V_d C(t)$$\n\n2.  The definition of clearance, $CL$, states that the rate of elimination is proportional to the plasma concentration:\n    $$\\text{Rate of Elimination} = CL \\cdot C(t)$$\n\n3.  The mass balance for a one-compartment model with no ongoing administration (i.e., after a bolus injection) states that the rate of change of the amount of the drug in the body is equal to the negative of its elimination rate:\n    $$\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -(\\text{Rate of Elimination})$$\n    Substituting the definition of clearance, we get:\n    $$\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -CL \\cdot C(t)$$\n\nTo obtain a differential equation solely in terms of concentration $C(t)$, we differentiate the volume of distribution equation with respect to time, assuming $V_d$ is a constant:\n$$\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = V_d \\frac{dC(t)}{dt}$$\n\nEquating the two expressions for $\\frac{dA(t)}{dt}$ yields the governing ordinary differential equation:\n$$V_d \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -CL \\cdot C(t)$$\n\nThis is a first-order separable differential equation. We can rearrange it to separate the variables $C$ and $t$:\n$$\\frac{1}{C(t)} dC(t) = -\\frac{CL}{V_d} dt$$\n\nWe integrate both sides. Let the initial concentration at time $t=0$ be $C(0)$. We integrate from $t=0$ to a general time $t$:\n$$\\int_{C(0)}^{C(t)} \\frac{1}{C} dC = -\\frac{CL}{V_d} \\int_{0}^{t} d\\tau$$\n$$\\Big[\\ln(C)\\Big]_{C(0)}^{C(t)} = -\\frac{CL}{V_d} \\Big[\\tau\\Big]_{0}^{t}$$\n$$\\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C(0)) = -\\fracCL}{V_d} t$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C(0)}\\right) = -\\frac{CL}{V_d} t$$\n\nExponentiating both sides gives the concentration as a function of time:\n$$C(t) = C(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V_d} t\\right)$$\n\nThe plasma half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time at which the concentration $C(t)$ falls to one-half of its initial value, $C(0)$. So, at $t=t_{1/2}$, we have $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} C(0)$. Substituting this into the concentration equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} C(0) = C(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V_d} t_{1/2}\\right)$$\nDividing by $C(0)$ (which is non-zero):\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V_d} t_{1/2}\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{CL}{V_d} t_{1/2}$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$:\n$$-\\ln(2) = -\\frac{CL}{V_d} t_{1/2}$$\nFinally, solving for $t_{1/2}$ gives the desired expression:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{V_d \\ln(2)}{CL}$$\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of Half-Life for Specific eGFR Values\n\nFirst, we calculate the patient-specific volume of distribution, $V_d$. The patient's body weight is $70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n$$V_d = 0.25\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{kg}} \\times 70\\,\\mathrm{kg} = 17.5\\,\\mathrm{L}$$\n\nNext, we establish the clearance, $CL$, for each case. The problem states that for this patient with a body surface area of $1.73\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$, $CL$ in $\\mathrm{mL/min}$ is numerically equal to the $\\mathrm{eGFR}$ in $\\mathrm{mL/min/1.73\\,m^2}$. The final answer for $t_{1/2}$ is required in hours.

The odds of an event is the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring. In a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table with counts $a, b, c, d$, the odds of disease in an exposed group is $a/b$, and in an unexposed group is $c/d$.
