Consider a homogeneous static magnetic field $B_0$ and analyze the phase evolution in the rotating frame whose frequency is set to the water resonance.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The analysis of the spin echo sequence is performed in the rotating frame, whose angular frequency is set to the Larmor frequency of water, $\\omega_0 = \\gamma B_0$. In this frame, the evolution of the phase $\\phi$ of a spin is governed by its frequency offset from water, $\\omega_{rot}$. For a time-independent offset, the phase accumulated over a time interval $\\Delta t$ is $\\Delta \\phi = \\omega_{rot} \\Delta t$.\n\n**1. Computation of the Relative Phase Difference $\\Delta \\phi(T_E)$**\n\nWe begin by establishing the frequency offsets for water and fat spins in the chosen rotating frame.\n-   Water spins, by definition of the rotating frame, have a frequency offset of $\\omega_{W, rot} = 0$.\n-   Fat spins have a Larmor frequency that differs from water by $\\Delta \\omega = \\delta \\omega_0$. Therefore, in the rotating frame, their frequency offset is $\\omega_{F, rot} = \\Delta \\omega$.\n\nThe spin echo sequence involves three key time points: the $90^{\\circ}$ excitation pulse at $t=0$, the $180^{\\circ}$ refocusing pulse at $t=T_E/2$, and the echo at $t=T_E$. We will track the phase of both water and fat spins through this sequence, assuming their phase is $0$ immediately after the $90^{\\circ}$ pulse aligns them onto the transverse plane.\n\n**Phase evolution from $t=0$ to $t=T_E/2$:**\nDuring this first interval of duration $T_E/2$, the spins precess freely according to their frequency offsets.\n-   The phase accumulated by water spins is:\n    $$ \\phi_W(T_E/2^{-}) = \\omega_{W, rot} \\times \\frac{T_E}{2} = 0 \\times \\frac{T_E}{2} = 0 $$\n-   The phase accumulated by fat spins is:\n    $$ \\phi_F(T_E/2^{-}) = \\omega_{F, rot} \\times \\frac{T_E}{2} = \\Delta \\omega \\frac{T_E}{2} $$\nThe notation $T_E/2^{-}$ indicates the time just before the $180^{\\circ}$ pulse.\n\n**Effect of the $180^{\\circ}$ pulse at $t=T_E/2$:**\nAn ideal $180^{\\circ}$ RF pulse applied along, for instance, the x-axis in the rotating frame, flips the transverse magnetization vector across the x-axis ($M_y \\rightarrow -M_y$, $M_x \\rightarrow M_x$). In terms of complex phase representation $M_{xy} = M_x + iM_y$, this corresponds to complex conjugation, which is equivalent to negating the accumulated phase: $\\phi \\rightarrow -\\phi$.\n-   The phase of water spins immediately after the pulse ($t=T_E/2^{+}$) is:\n    $$ \\phi_W(T_E/2^{+}) = -\\phi_W(T_E/2^{-}) = -0 = 0 $$\n-   The phase of fat spins immediately after the pulse is:\n    $$ \\phi_F(T_E/2^{+}) = -\\phi_F(T_E/2^{-}) = -\\Delta \\omega \\frac{T_E}{2} $$\n\n**Phase evolution from $t=T_E/2$ to $t=T_E$:**\nDuring this second interval, also of duration $T_E/2$, the spins again precess freely with the same static frequency offsets. The final phase at $t=T_E$ is the sum of the phase after the pulse and the additional phase accumulated in the second interval.\n-   The final phase of water spins at the echo time $t=T_E$ is:\n    $$ \\phi_W(T_E) = \\phi_W(T_E/2^{+}) + \\omega_{W, rot} \\times \\frac{T_E}{2} = 0 + 0 \\times \\frac{T_E}{2} = 0 $$\n-   The final phase of fat spins at the echo time $t=T_E$ is:\n    $$ \\phi_F(T_E) = \\phi_F(T_E/2^{+}) + \\omega_{F, rot} \\times \\frac{T_E}{2} = \\left(-\\Delta \\omega \\frac{T_E}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\Delta \\omega \\frac{T_E}{2}\\right) = 0 $$\nBoth water and fat spins are returned to zero phase at the center of the echo. This demonstrates the refocusing effect of the spin echo sequence on static frequency offsets.\n\nThe relative phase difference $\\Delta \\phi(T_E)$ between fat and water at the echo time is:\n$$ \\Delta \\phi(T_E) = \\phi_F(T_E) - \\phi_W(T_E) = 0 - 0 = 0 $$\n\n**2. Explanation of Slice Selection vs. Chemical Shift Refocusing**\n\nThe key to this explanation lies in distinguishing between a phase evolution process that is continuous in time and a spatial encoding event that is locked to the duration of the RF pulses.\n\nThe Larmor angular frequency $\\omega$ of a spin at position $z$ under a slice-select gradient $G_z$ is given by the linear mapping:\n$$ \\omega(z) = \\gamma (B_0 + G_z z) = \\omega_0 + \\gamma G_z z $$\n\n**Refocusing of a Static Frequency Offset (e.g., Chemical Shift):**\nAs derived in Part 1, a static frequency offset, such as the chemical shift $\\Delta \\omega$, causes a phase accumulation $\\phi_1 = \\Delta \\omega (T_E/2)$ in the first time interval. This process is **time-reversible** by the $180^{\\circ}$ pulse. The pulse acts as a phase-conjugation operator, effectively flipping the sign of the accumulated phase to $-\\phi_1$. In the second time interval, an identical amount of phase $\\phi_2 = \\Delta \\omega (T_E/2)$ is accumulated. The final phase at $t=T_E$ is the sum of the conjugated initial phase and the subsequent phase: $\\phi(T_E) = -\\phi_1 + \\phi_2 = -\\Delta \\omega (T_E/2) + \\Delta \\omega (T_E/2) = 0$. The dephasing is canceled because the cause ($\\Delta \\omega$) is a constant offset present throughout the entire evolution period between pulses.\n\n**Non-reversal of Slice Displacement:**\nSlice selection is performed by applying the gradient $G_z$ **concurrently** with an RF pulse of a specific center frequency $\\omega_{RF}$ and bandwidth. A spin is excited or refocused only if its Larmor frequency $\\omega(z)$ matches a frequency within the pulse's spectrum.\n\nConsider the $90^{\\circ}$ excitation pulse, applied with a gradient $G_{z,90}$ and centered at $\\omega_{RF}$. For a water spin to be excited at the slice center $z_W$, its frequency must match the pulse frequency:\n$$ \\omega_0 + \\gamma G_{z,90} z_W = \\omega_{RF} \\implies \\gamma G_{z,90} z_W = \\omega_{RF} - \\omega_0 $$\nFor a fat spin to be excited, its frequency, which includes the chemical shift offset $\\Delta\\omega$, must match the same RF pulse frequency. This occurs at a different position $z_F$:\n$$ (\\omega_0 + \\Delta\\omega) + \\gamma G_{z,90} z_F = \\omega_{RF} \\implies \\gamma G_{z,90} z_F = \\omega_{RF} - \\omega_0 - \\Delta\\omega $$\nCombining these equations shows that the excited fat slice is spatially shifted relative to the water slice:\n$$ \\gamma G_{z,90} (z_W - z_F) = \\Delta\\omega \\implies \\Delta z = z_W - z_F = \\frac{\\Delta\\omega}{\\gamma G_{z,90}} $$\nThis spatial encoding event, the \"slice displacement,\" is completed when the $90^{\\circ}$ pulse and its accompanying gradient end. The effect is that a physically different set of spins (fat at $z_F$, water at $z_W$) has been selected.\n\nNow, consider the $180^{\\circ}$ refocusing pulse. It is also slice-selective and is applied with its own gradient $G_{z,180}$ (typically $G_{z,180} = G_{z,90}$) to act on the same slice. The pulse will only affect spins that meet its resonance condition. This leads to the **exact same spatial displacement phenomenon**. The $180^{\\circ}$ pulse refocuses the water spins at position $z_W$ and the fat spins at position $z_F$.\n\nThe critical distinction is:\n- The phase accumulation $\\Delta \\omega \\cdot t$ is a state variable that evolves over time. The $180^{\\circ}$ pulse can manipulate this historical accumulation by inverting its sign. This effect is **time-reversible**.\n- The slice displacement $\\Delta z$ is not an accumulated phase history. It is a spatial selection based on resonance conditions that exist only **during the RF pulse**. The $180^{\\circ}$ pulse cannot go back in time to change which spins were selected by the initial $90^{\\circ}$ pulse. Instead, it performs its own, independent slice selection, which is subject to the same physical laws and thus imparts the same spatial shift. The effect is **not time-reversible** by the refocusing pulse because the condition causing it (the gradient $G_z$) is not a static property of the spin system between pulses but an external field applied to define the slice itself. The $180^{\\circ}$ pulse does not \"undo\" the first spatial shift; it simply repeats it.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "4935717"}, {"introduction": "While a spin echo can correct for static field variations, it is sensitive to dynamic changes that occur during the echo time, such as patient motion or blood flow.

Consider an ensemble of identical hydrogen nuclei in a main magnetic field whose spatial inhomogeneity can be modeled as a static, uniform, linear field gradient along the $z$-axis, so that the local Larmor angular frequency offset is $\\omega(z)=\\gamma G z$, where $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio and $G$ is the constant gradient amplitude along $z$.
