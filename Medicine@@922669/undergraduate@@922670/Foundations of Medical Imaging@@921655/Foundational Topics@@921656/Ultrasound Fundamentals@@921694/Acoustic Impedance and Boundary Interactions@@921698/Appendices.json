It is a standard, formalizable problem in the foundations of medical imaging.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\nLet the interface between the soft tissue (medium $1$, $x<0$) and bone (medium $2$, $x>0$) be at $x=0$. We consider a time-harmonic plane wave with angular frequency $\\omega$. The acoustic pressure waves in the two media can be represented in complex exponential form.\n\nIn medium $1$ ($x<0$), the total acoustic pressure is the sum of the incident and reflected waves:\n$$p_1(x,t) = p_i(x,t) + p_r(x,t) = P_i \\exp(j(\\omega t - k_1 x)) + P_r \\exp(j(\\omega t + k_1 x))$$\nHere, $P_i$ and $P_r$ are the complex amplitudes of the incident and reflected pressure waves, respectively, and $k_1$ is the wavenumber in medium $1$. The wave propagating in the $+x$ direction has a phase term $-k_1 x$, while the reflected wave propagating in the $-x$ direction has a phase term $+k_1 x$.\n\nThe corresponding particle velocity, $u = p/Z$, is:\n$$u_1(x,t) = u_i(x,t) + u_r(x,t) = \\frac{P_i}{Z_1} \\exp(j(\\omega t - k_1 x)) - \\frac{P_r}{Z_1} \\exp(j(\\omega t + k_1 x))$$\nThe negative sign for the reflected velocity term arises because the direction of particle motion is coupled to the direction of wave propagation. For a wave moving in the $-x$ direction, the relationship is $u = -p/Z$.\n\nIn medium $2$ ($x>0$), there is only a transmitted wave propagating in the $+x$ direction:\n$$p_2(x,t) = p_t(x,t) = P_t \\exp(j(\\omega t - k_2 x))$$\n$$u_2(x,t) = u_t(x,t) = \\frac{P_t}{Z_2} \\exp(j(\\omega t - k_2 x))$$\nHere, $P_t$ is the complex amplitude of the transmitted pressure wave and $k_2$ is the wavenumber in medium $2$.\n\nThe boundary conditions at the interface $x=0$ require the continuity of pressure and particle velocity:\n1.  $p_1(0,t) = p_2(0,t)$\n2.  $u_1(0,t) = u_2(0,t)$\n\nApplying the first boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$P_i \\exp(j\\omega t) + P_r \\exp(j\\omega t) = P_t \\exp(j\\omega t)$$\n$$P_i + P_r = P_t \\quad (1)$$\n\nApplying the second boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$\\frac{P_i}{Z_1} \\exp(j\\omega t) - \\frac{P_r}{Z_1} \\exp(j\\omega t) = \\frac{P_t}{Z_2} \\exp(j\\omega t)$$\n$$\\frac{1}{Z_1} (P_i - P_r) = \\frac{P_t}{Z_2} \\quad (2)$$\n\nThe pressure reflection coefficient, $R_p$, is defined as the ratio of the reflected pressure amplitude to the incident pressure amplitude, $R_p = \\frac{P_r}{P_i}$. We seek to find an expression for this quantity. We can eliminate $P_t$ by substituting equation $(1)$ into equation $(2)$:\n$$\\frac{1}{Z_1} (P_i - P_r) = \\frac{P_i + P_r}{Z_2}$$\nTo solve for $R_p$, we rearrange this equation to group terms with $P_i$ and $P_r$:\n$$Z_2 (P_i - P_r) = Z_1 (P_i + P_r)$$\n$$Z_2 P_i - Z_2 P_r = Z_1 P_i + Z_1 P_r$$\n$$Z_2 P_i - Z_1 P_i = Z_1 P_r + Z_2 P_r$$\n$$P_i (Z_2 - Z_1) = P_r (Z_1 + Z_2)$$\nDividing by $P_i$ and by $(Z_1 + Z_2)$:\n$$R_p = \\frac{P_r}{P_i} = \\frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_2 + Z_1}$$\nThis is the general expression for the pressure reflection coefficient at normal incidence.\n\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of this coefficient. Since the media are assumed to be lossless, their specific acoustic impedances $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are real quantities. Therefore, the magnitude $|R_p|$ is the absolute value of the expression:\n$$|R_p| = \\left| \\frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_2 + Z_1} \\right|$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the given data: $Z_1 = 1.5\\ \\text{MRayl}$ and $Z_2 = 7\\ \\text{MRayl}$.\n$$|R_p| = \\left| \\frac{7 - 1.5}{7 + 1.5} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{5.5}{8.5} \\right|$$\n$$|R_p| = \\frac{5.5}{8.5} \\approx 0.6470588...$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives:\n$$|R_p| \\approx 0.6471$$\n\n**Commentary on Imaging Implications**\nThe calculated magnitude of the pressure reflection coefficient, $|R_p| \\approx 0.6471$, is a large value. This indicates that approximately $64.7\\%$ of the incident pressure wave's amplitude is reflected at the soft tissue–bone interface. The intensity reflection coefficient, $R_I$, which describes the fraction of energy reflected, is given by $R_I = |R_p|^2$. In this case, $R_I \\approx (0.6471)^2 \\approx 0.4187$, meaning that nearly $42\\%$ of the incident ultrasound energy is reflected back to the transducer.\n\nThis has two major implications for diagnostic ultrasound imaging:\n1.  **High Echogenicity**: The strong reflection from the bone surface generates a powerful echo. In a B-mode ultrasound image, signal intensity is mapped to brightness. Therefore, the interface between soft tissue and bone appears as a very bright (hyperechoic) line, making bone surfaces easily identifiable.\n2.  **Acoustic Shadowing**: Because a large fraction of the energy is reflected, only a smaller fraction is transmitted into the bone to interrogate deeper structures. The high impedance of bone also leads to strong attenuation (absorption and scattering) of the transmitted wave. The combination of high reflection at the surface and high attenuation within the bone means that very little to no ultrasound energy can penetrate through the bone and return from tissues behind it. This results in an \"acoustic shadow,\" an anechoic (black) region on the image deep to the bone, where anatomical structures cannot be visualized. This phenomenon is why ultrasound has limited utility for imaging the adult brain through the skull or for visualizing organs completely obscured by the rib cage.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6471}$$", "id": "4860354"}, {"introduction": "To master a physical principle, it is often helpful to explore its behavior in idealized scenarios.

A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nUnder the assumption of linear acoustics, the acoustic pressure $p(z,t)$ in a homogeneous medium is governed by the wave equation. For a monochromatic plane wave of angular frequency $\\omega$ propagating along the $z$-axis, the solutions can be expressed in complex exponential form.\n\nThe incident wave propagates in the $+z$-direction and is described by the pressure field $p_i(z,t)$. We can write this as:\n$$ p_i(z,t) = P_{i} \\exp(j(kz - \\omega t)) $$\nwhere $P_i$ is the complex pressure amplitude of the incident wave, and $k = \\omega/c$ is the acoustic wave number.\n\nUpon striking the boundary at $z=0$, a reflected wave is generated, which propagates in the $-z$-direction. Its pressure field, $p_r(z,t)$, can be written as:\n$$ p_r(z,t) = P_{r} \\exp(j(-kz - \\omega t)) $$\nwhere $P_r$ is the complex pressure amplitude of the reflected wave. The change in sign of the $kz$ term signifies the change in the direction of propagation.\n\nThe total acoustic pressure field $p(z,t)$ in the medium (for $z<0$) is the linear superposition of the incident and reflected waves:\n$$ p(z,t) = p_i(z,t) + p_r(z,t) = P_{i} \\exp(j(kz - \\omega t)) + P_{r} \\exp(j(-kz - \\omega t)) $$\n\nThe problem states that the boundary at $z=0$ is \"perfectly soft\" or \"pressure-release.\" This imposes the boundary condition that the total acoustic pressure at this location must be zero for all time $t$:\n$$ p(z=0, t) = 0 \\quad \\forall t $$\n\nApplying this boundary condition to the expression for the total pressure field:\n$$ p(0,t) = P_{i} \\exp(j(k \\cdot 0 - \\omega t)) + P_{r} \\exp(j(-k \\cdot 0 - \\omega t)) = 0 $$\n$$ p(0,t) = P_{i} \\exp(-j\\omega t) + P_{r} \\exp(-j\\omega t) = 0 $$\n\nWe can factor out the common time-dependent term $\\exp(-j\\omega t)$:\n$$ (P_{i} + P_{r}) \\exp(-j\\omega t) = 0 $$\nFor this equation to hold true for all values of time $t$, the term in the parentheses must be equal to zero, as the exponential term is never zero.\n$$ P_{i} + P_{r} = 0 $$\nThis relationship implies that the complex amplitude of the reflected wave is the negative of the complex amplitude of the incident wave:\n$$ P_{r} = -P_{i} $$\n\nThe pressure reflection coefficient, $R_p$, is defined as the ratio of the complex pressure amplitudes of the reflected and incident waves:\n$$ R_{p} = \\frac{P_{r}}{P_{i}} $$\n\nSubstituting the result from the boundary condition, $P_r = -P_i$, into the definition of $R_p$:\n$$ R_{p} = \\frac{-P_{i}}{P_{i}} = -1 $$\n\nThe result is a dimensionless real number, as required. This physical result signifies a perfect, phase-inverted reflection. At the boundary, the reflected pressure wave is exactly out of phase by $\\pi$ radians ($180^\\circ$) with the incident wave and has the same magnitude, ensuring their sum is always zero.\n\nNote that the acoustic impedance of the medium $Z=\\rho c$ was provided but not directly used in this derivation. However, this result is consistent with the general formula for a pressure reflection coefficient at an interface between two media with impedances $Z_1$ and $Z_2$, which is $R_p = (Z_2 - Z_1)/(Z_2 + Z_1)$. A perfectly soft, pressure-release boundary can be modeled as an interface with a second medium of zero acoustic impedance ($Z_2=0$). In this case, our medium has impedance $Z_1 = Z = \\rho c$.
