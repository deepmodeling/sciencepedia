A plane wave with angular frequency $\\omega$ is incident normally on the planar interface at $x=0$.\n\nIn medium $1$, the total acoustic pressure $p_1(x,t)$ is the sum of the incident pressure wave $p_i(x,t)$ and the reflected pressure wave $p_r(x,t)$. The total acoustic pressure in medium $2$, $p_2(x,t)$, is just the transmitted pressure wave $p_t(x,t)$. Using complex exponential notation for time-harmonic waves, we can write:\n$$p_i(x,t) = P_i e^{j(\\omega t - k_1 x)}$$\n$$p_r(x,t) = P_r e^{j(\\omega t + k_1 x)}$$\n$$p_t(x,t) = P_t e^{j(\\omega t - k_2 x)}$$\nwhere $P_i$, $P_r$, and $P_t$ are the complex pressure amplitudes of the incident, reflected, and transmitted waves, respectively. $k_1$ and $k_2$ are the wavenumbers in medium $1$ and $2$.\n\nThe problem provides the definition of specific acoustic impedance for a plane wave as $Z = p/u$, where $u$ is the particle velocity. The particle velocity is in the direction of wave propagation. For a wave propagating in the $+x$ direction, $u = p/Z$. For a wave propagating in the $-x$ direction, $u = -p/Z$.

Consequently, the fraction of transmitted intensity, $T_I = 1 - R_I$, is only about $0.1\\%$. The drastic mismatch in acoustic impedance between soft tissue and the air-filled lung creates an almost perfect acoustic mirror. This near-total reflection means that an insignificant amount of ultrasound energy penetrates the lung. As a result, it is not feasible to obtain a clear ultrasound image of any anatomical structures lying within or deep to the lung, as the returning echoes from these structures would be far too weak to detect. The lung effectively casts a strong \"acoustic shadow,\" obscuring everything behind it from the view of the ultrasound transducer.

For a pure shear wave propagating in the $x$-direction, the particle displacement is transverse to the direction of propagation. Let the displacement be in the $y$-direction, so $\\mathbf{u}(x,t) = u_y(x,t)\\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$.\n\nThe infinitesimal strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is defined as the symmetric part of the displacement gradient:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\nabla\\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla\\mathbf{u})^T \\right] $$\nFor the displacement field $\\mathbf{u} = u_y(x,t)\\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$, the only non-zero component of the displacement gradient $\\nabla\\mathbf{u}$ is $\\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x}$. The strain tensor components are therefore:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{xy} = \\varepsilon_{yx} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} $$\nAll other components of $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ are zero. Notably, the volumetric strain, or the trace of the strain tensor, is $\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = \\varepsilon_{kk} = \\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy} + \\varepsilon_{zz} = 0$.\n\nThe problem states to use the linear isotropic shear stress–strain relation. For a linear isotropic elastic material, this is given by Hooke's law:\n$$ \\sigma_{ij} = \\lambda_L \\varepsilon_{kk}\\delta_{ij} + 2\\mu\\varepsilon_{ij} $$\nwhere $\\lambda_L$ and $\\mu$ are the Lamé parameters, with $\\mu$ being the shear modulus.\nSince $\\varepsilon_{kk}=0$ for this deformation, the stress-strain relation simplifies to $\\sigma_{ij} = 2\\mu\\varepsilon_{ij}$. The only non-zero components of the stress tensor are:\n$$ \\sigma_{xy} = \\sigma_{yx} = 2\\mu\\varepsilon_{xy} = 2\\mu \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} \\right) = \\mu \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the stress tensor components back into the equation of motion. The vector equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t^2}$ can be expanded into its components. The only non-trivial component is in the $y$-direction:\n$$ (\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma})_y = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{xy}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{yy}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zy}}{\\partial z} = \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 u_y}{\\partial t^2} $$\nSince $\\sigma_{yy}=0$ and $\\sigma_{zy}=0$, this reduces to:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\mu \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} \\right) = \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 u_y}{\\partial t^2} $$\nFor a homogeneous medium, the shear modulus $\\mu$ is spatially constant, so we can write:\n$$ \\mu \\frac{\\partial^2 u_y}{\\partial x^2} = \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 u_y}{\\partial t^2} $$\nThis is the one-dimensional wave equation for shear waves. It can be written as $\\frac{\\partial^2 u_y}{\\partial t^2} = c_s^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u_y}{\\partial x^2}$, where $c_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}}$ is the shear wave speed.\n\nTo find the dispersion relation, we assume a time-harmonic plane wave solution of the form $u_y(x,t) = A \\exp\\left(i(kx - \\omega t)\\right)$, where $k$ is the wavenumber and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. Taking the partial derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 u_y}{\\partial x^2} = (ik)^2 u_y = -k^2 u_y $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 u_y}{\\partial t^2} = (-i\\omega)^2 u_y = -\\omega^2 u_y $$\nSubstituting these into the wave equation gives:\n$$ \\mu(-k^2 u_y) = \\rho(-\\omega^2 u_y) $$\nDividing by $-u_y$ (which is non-zero), we obtain the dispersion relation:\n$$ \\mu k^2 = \\rho \\omega^2 $$\n\n### Expression for Shear Modulus and Calculation\n\nWe can rearrange the dispersion relation to solve for the shear modulus $\\mu$:\n$$ \\mu = \\rho \\left( \\frac{\\omega}{k} \\right)^2 $$\nThe measurable quantities are the driving frequency $f$, the separation between sensors $\\Delta x$, and the phase lag $\\Delta \\phi$.
