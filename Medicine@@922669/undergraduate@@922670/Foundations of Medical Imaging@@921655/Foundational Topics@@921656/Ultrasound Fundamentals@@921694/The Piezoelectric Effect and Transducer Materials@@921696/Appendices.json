I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested: deriving the governing relationship, explaining the calibration process, and calculating the unknown piezoelectric coefficient.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Relationship**\n\nWe begin with the constitutive equation for the direct piezoelectric effect, which relates the electric displacement $D$ to the applied stress $T$. For a material poled along the '3' axis, with a uniaxial stress $T_{33}$ applied along the same axis, the component of the electric displacement along this axis is given by:\n$$D_3 = d_{33} T_{33} + \\epsilon_{33}^{T} E_3$$\nwhere $D_3$ is the electric displacement, $T_{33}$ is the stress, $d_{33}$ is the longitudinal piezoelectric charge coefficient, $\\epsilon_{33}^{T}$ is the permittivity at constant stress, and $E_3$ is the electric field.\n\nThe problem states that the specimen's electrodes are connected to a transimpedance amplifier whose input is at virtual ground. This implies that the potential difference across the electrodes is maintained at approximately zero. Consequently, the electric field within the piezoelectric material, $E_3$, is negligible ($E_3 \\approx 0$). The constitutive equation simplifies to:\n$$D_3 = d_{33} T_{33}$$\nThe electric displacement $D_3$ is defined as the charge per unit area. For a specimen with a fully and uniformly electroded area $A$, the total charge $Q$ generated on the electrode is:\n$$Q = D_3 A$$\nThe stress $T_{33}$ is defined as the force per unit area. The problem states the stress is spatially uniform, so for a total applied force $F$ on the area $A$:\n$$T_{33} = \\frac{F}{A}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $D_3$ and $T_{33}$ into the simplified constitutive equation gives:\n$$\\frac{Q}{A} = d_{33} \\frac{F}{A}$$\nThis simplifies to a direct relationship between the generated charge and the applied force:\n$$Q(t) = d_{33} F(t)$$\nThe applied force is sinusoidal with frequency $f$ and amplitude $F_0$. We can write it as $F(t) = F_0 \\sin(\\omega t)$, where the angular frequency is $\\omega = 2\\pi f$. The generated charge is therefore also sinusoidal:\n$$Q(t) = d_{33} F_0 \\sin(\\omega t)$$\nThis charge flows from the specimen into the input of the transimpedance amplifier. The resulting electric current $I(t)$ is the time derivative of the charge:\n$$I(t) = \\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} [d_{33} F_0 \\sin(\\omega t)]$$\n$$I(t) = d_{33} F_0 \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)$$\nThe amplitude of this sinusoidal current, $I_0$, is:\n$$I_0 = d_{33} F_0 \\omega = 2\\pi f d_{33} F_0$$\nA transimpedance amplifier with a feedback resistor $R_f$ produces an output voltage $V_{\\text{out}}(t)$ given by $V_{\\text{out}}(t) = -R_f I(t)$. The amplitude of the output voltage, $V_0$, is therefore:\n$$V_0 = R_f I_0$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I_0$, we arrive at the final relationship between the output voltage amplitude $V_0$ and the piezoelectric coefficient $d_{33}$:\n$$V_0 = 2\\pi f R_f d_{33} F_0$$\n\n**Part 2: Explanation of the Calibration Step**\n\nThe calibration step uses a reference specimen with a known longitudinal piezoelectric charge coefficient, $d_{33,\\mathrm{ref}}$. The instrument is operated at a fixed drive setting, which corresponds to a specific, but initially unknown, force amplitude $F_0$. The frequency $f$ and feedback resistance $R_f$ are known instrument parameters. By measuring the output voltage amplitude, $V_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, the force amplitude $F_0$ can be determined.\n\nUsing the derived relationship for the reference specimen:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 2\\pi f R_f d_{33,\\mathrm{ref}} F_0$$\nTo determine the force amplitude, we can rearrange this equation:\n$$F_0 = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{2\\pi f R_f d_{33,\\mathrm{ref}}}$$\nThis calculation calibrates the actuator's drive setting, establishing a precise value for the force amplitude $F_0$ it generates under these specific operating conditions. All quantities on the right-hand side are either known constants or are measured during calibration.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of $d_{33,\\mathrm{unk}}$**\n\nAfter calibration, the reference specimen is replaced with an unknown specimen, and the measurement is repeated at the *same drive setting*. This ensures that the applied force amplitude $F_0$ is identical to the one determined during calibration. The output voltage amplitude from the unknown specimen, $V_{\\mathrm{unk}}$, is measured. The governing equation for this measurement is:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{unk}} = 2\\pi f R_f d_{33,\\mathrm{unk}} F_0$$\nWe now have a system of two equations:\n1. For the reference: $V_{\\mathrm{ref}} = (2\\pi f R_f F_0) d_{33,\\mathrm{ref}}$\n2. For the unknown: $V_{\\mathrm{unk}} = (2\\pi f R_f F_0) d_{33,\\mathrm{unk}}$\n\nThe term $(2\\pi f R_f F_0)$ is a constant factor common to both measurements. By taking the ratio of the second equation to the first, this factor cancels out, which provides a robust method for finding $d_{33,\\mathrm{unk}}$ without explicitly calculating $F_0$:\n$$\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{unk}}}{V_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = \\frac{(2\\pi f R_f F_0) d_{33,\\mathrm{unk}}}{(2\\pi f R_f F_0) d_{33,\\mathrm{ref}}} = \\frac{d_{33,\\mathrm{unk}}}{d_{33,\\mathrm{ref}}}$$\nFrom this ratiometric relationship, we can solve for $d_{33,\\mathrm{unk}}$:\n$$d_{33,\\mathrm{unk}} = d_{33,\\mathrm{ref}} \\left( \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{unk}}}{V_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\right)$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n-   $d_{33,\\mathrm{ref}} = 375$ pC/N\n-   $V_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 0.246$ V\n-   $V_{\\mathrm{unk}} = 0.207$ V\n\nNote that the units of $d_{33,\\mathrm{unk}}$ will be the same as the units of $d_{33,\\mathrm{ref}}$ (pC/N).\n$$d_{33,\\mathrm{unk}} = 375 \\times \\left( \\frac{0.207}{0.246} \\right)$$\n$$d_{33,\\mathrm{unk}} = 375 \\times 0.8414634...$$\n$$d_{33,\\mathrm{unk}} = 315.5487... \\text{ pC/N}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$d_{33,\\mathrm{unk}} \\approx 315.5 \\text{ pC/N}$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{315.5}\n$$", "id": "4934852"}, {"introduction": "While the piezoelectric effect enables medical imaging, it also imposes operational limits on transducer performance.

The problem describes a physically realistic scenario involving a piezoelectric transducer under high stress, a common concern in high-power ultrasound applications. It uses standard linear piezoelectric theory and provides a set of consistent and physically reasonable material properties for lead zirconate titanate (PZT). The objective is clearly stated: to derive an expression for the induced electric field and then compute a dimensionless risk metric for depoling. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary data provided. The phrasing regarding the open-circuit condition, while slightly convoluted, unambiguously implies the standard boundary condition of zero electric displacement ($D_3=0$) for an isolated, uncharged transducer element. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be formulated.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts: first, the derivation of the peak induced electric field, and second, the calculation of the dimensionless depoling risk metric $\\mathcal{R}$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Induced Electric Field**\n\nWe begin with the linear piezoelectric constitutive relations. For a material poled along the $3$-axis and subjected to stress and electric fields primarily in that direction (thickness mode), we are interested in the coupling between the components $T_{33}$ (stress), $S_{33}$ (strain), $E_3$ (electric field), and $D_3$ (electric displacement). The relevant constitutive equation that relates electric displacement to stress and electric field, often called the \"d-form\", is:\n$$D_3 = d_{33} T_{33} + \\epsilon_{33}^{T} E_3$$\nHere, $d_{33}$ is the piezoelectric charge coefficient, and $\\epsilon_{33}^{T}$ is the permittivity of the material at constant stress. The superscript $T$ on the permittivity denotes this condition.\n\nThe problem states that on the time scale of the acoustic cycle, the transducer electrodes are effectively open-circuited. For a piezoelectric element that is initially electrically neutral, an open-circuit condition means no free charge can flow to or from the electrodes. By Gauss's law, the electric displacement normal to the surface is equal to the free surface charge density. With no free charge accumulation on the electrodes, the electric displacement in the bulk of the material must be zero. Thus, we enforce the boundary condition:\n$$D_3 = 0$$\nSubstituting this condition into the constitutive equation gives:\n$$0 = d_{33} T_{33} + \\epsilon_{33}^{T} E_3$$\nWe can now solve for the internally induced electric field $E_3$ as a function of the applied stress $T_{33}$:\n$$\\epsilon_{33}^{T} E_3 = -d_{33} T_{33}$$\n$$E_3 = -\\frac{d_{33}}{\\epsilon_{33}^{T}} T_{33}$$\nThis equation shows that the induced electric field is directly proportional to the applied stress. The negative sign indicates that for a material with $d_{33}  0$ (like PZT), a compressive stress ($T_{33}  0$) induces an electric field $E_3$ in the negative $3$-direction, opposing the original direction of poling. This opposing field is what creates the risk of depoling the material.\n\nThe peak induced electric field, $E_{3,\\mathrm{peak}}$, will correspond to the peak applied stress, $T_{33,\\mathrm{peak}}$. The derived expression is therefore:\n$$E_{3,\\mathrm{peak}} = -\\frac{d_{33}}{\\epsilon_{33}^{T}} T_{33,\\mathrm{peak}}$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Depoling Risk Metric**\n\nThe problem defines a dimensionless risk metric $\\mathcal{R}$ as the ratio of the magnitude of the peak induced electric field to the coercive field magnitude $E_c$:\n$$\\mathcal{R} \\equiv \\frac{|E_{3,\\mathrm{peak}}|}{E_c}$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $E_{3,\\mathrm{peak}}$:\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{\\left| -\\frac{d_{33}}{\\epsilon_{33}^{T}} T_{33,\\mathrm{peak}} \\right|}{E_c}$$\nSince all the material coefficients ($d_{33}$, $\\epsilon_{33}^{T}$, $E_c$) and the peak stress ($T_{33,\\mathrm{peak}}$ representing compression) are given as positive values, the absolute value simplifies to:\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{d_{33} T_{33,\\mathrm{peak}}}{\\epsilon_{33}^{T} E_c}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression. It is crucial to use a consistent set of units (SI units).\n\nThe given values are:\n- $d_{33} = 400\\,\\mathrm{pC/N} = 400 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{C/N}$\n- $\\epsilon_{33}^{T} = 1500\\,\\epsilon_0$, where $\\epsilon_0 = 8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}$.

Pressure Reflection Coefficient at a Two-Media Interface\n\nWe consider a normally incident plane longitudinal wave traveling in medium 1 (impedance $Z_1=\\rho_1 c_1$) towards an interface at $x=0$ with medium 2 (impedance $Z_2=\\rho_2 c_2$). The wave phenomena are described by the one-dimensional acoustic wave equation.\n\nLet the pressure and particle velocity fields be represented by complex phasors, with time dependence $\\exp(i\\omega t)$ suppressed. The incident wave in medium 1 is $p_I(x) = P_I \\exp(-ik_1 x)$, where $k_1 = \\omega/c_1$ is the wavenumber. This gives rise to a reflected wave, $p_R(x) = P_R \\exp(ik_1 x)$, and a transmitted wave in medium 2, $p_T(x) = P_T \\exp(-ik_2 x)$, where $k_2 = \\omega/c_2$.\n\nThe total pressure in each medium is:\n$$p_1(x) = P_I \\exp(-ik_1 x) + P_R \\exp(ik_1 x)$$\n$$p_2(x) = P_T \\exp(-ik_2 x)$$\n\nThe relationship between pressure $p$ and normal particle velocity $u$ for a plane wave is $p = Zu$ for a forward-propagating wave (in the $+x$ direction) and $p = -Zu$ for a backward-propagating wave (in the $-x$ direction). Thus, the particle velocity in each medium is:\n$$u_1(x) = \\frac{1}{Z_1} (P_I \\exp(-ik_1 x) - P_R \\exp(ik_1 x))$$\n$$u_2(x) = \\frac{1}{Z_2} P_T \\exp(-ik_2 x)$$\n\nThe boundary conditions at the interface $x=0$ require continuity of pressure and normal particle velocity:\n1. $p_1(0) = p_2(0) \\implies P_I + P_R = P_T$\n2. $u_1(0) = u_2(0) \\implies \\frac{1}{Z_1} (P_I - P_R) = \\frac{1}{Z_2} P_T$\n\nWe can solve for the pressure reflection coefficient, $R_p = P_R / P_I$.

The interfaces are at $x=0$ (tissue-matching) and $x=d$ (matching-PZT). The PZT is treated as a semi-infinite medium. The impedance of the PZT, $Z_p$, acts as the load impedance for the matching layer.\n\nWe first determine the effective input impedance, $Z_{in}$, of the matching layer as seen from the tissue at $x=0$. The pressure and particle velocity in the matching layer ($0 \\le x \\le d$) can be written as a superposition of forward (+) and backward (-) propagating waves:\n$$p_m(x) = P_+ \\exp(-ik_m x) + P_- \\exp(ik_m x)$$\n$$u_m(x) = \\frac{1}{Z_m} (P_+ \\exp(-ik_m x) - P_- \\exp(ik_m x))$$\nwhere $Z_m = \\rho_m c_m$ and $k_m = \\omega/c_m$.\n\nThe impedance at any point $x$ within the layer is $Z(x) = p_m(x) / u_m(x)$.

At the second interface, $x=d$, the impedance must be continuous, so $Z(d) = Z_p$ (the impedance of the PZT load).\n$$Z(d) = \\frac{p_m(d)}{u_m(d)} = \\frac{P_+ \\exp(-ik_m d) + P_- \\exp(ik_m d)}{\\frac{1}{Z_m}(P_+ \\exp(-ik_m d) - P_- \\exp(ik_m d))} = Z_p$$\nSolving for the ratio $P_-/P_+$:\n$$Z_m (P_+ e^{-ik_m d} + P_- e^{ik_m d}) = Z_p (P_+ e^{-ik_m d} - P_- e^{ik_m d})$$\n$$P_-(Z_m e^{ik_m d} + Z_p e^{ik_m d}) = P_+(Z_p e^{-ik_m d} - Z_m e^{-ik_m d})$$\n$$\\frac{P_-}{P_+} = \\frac{Z_p - Z_m}{Z_p + Z_m} \\exp(-2ik_m d)$$\nThe input impedance at $x=0$ is:\n$$Z_{in} = Z(0) = \\frac{p_m(0)}{u_m(0)} = \\frac{P_+ + P_-}{\\frac{1}{Z_m}(P_+ - P_-)} = Z_m \\frac{1 + P_-/P_+}{1 - P_-/P_+}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P_-/P_+$:\n$$Z_{in} = Z_m \\frac{1 + \\frac{Z_p - Z_m}{Z_p + Z_m} \\exp(-2ik_m d)}{1 - \\frac{Z_p - Z_m}{Z_p + Z_m} \\exp(-2ik_m d)} = Z_m \\frac{(Z_p+Z_m) + (Z_p-Z_m)e^{-2ik_m d}}{(Z_p+Z_m) - (Z_p-Z_m)e^{-2ik_m d}}$$\nUsing $e^{-2ik_m d} = \\cos(2k_m d) - i\\sin(2k_m d)$ and simplifying, or more conveniently, using the standard transmission line formulation:\n$$Z_{in} = Z_m \\frac{Z_p \\cos(k_m d) + i Z_m \\sin(k_m d)}{Z_m \\cos(k_m d) + i Z_p \\sin(k_m d)}$$\nThe problem specifies a quarter-wave matching layer, so its thickness is $d = \\lambda_m / 4$. Since the wavenumber is $k_m = 2\\pi/\\lambda_m$, the argument of the trigonometric functions becomes:\n$$k_m d = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda_m} \\frac{\\lambda_m}{4} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$$\nSubstituting this value into the expression for $Z_{in}$:\n$$Z_{in} = Z_m \\frac{Z_p \\cos(\\pi/2) + i Z_m \\sin(\\pi/2)}{Z_m \\cos(\\pi/2) + i Z_p \\sin(\\pi/2)} = Z_m \\frac{Z_p(0) + i Z_m(1)}{Z_m(0) + i Z_p(1)} = Z_m \\frac{iZ_m}{iZ_p}$$\n$$Z_{in} = \\frac{Z_m^2}{Z_p}$$\nThis is the effective input impedance of the PZT as seen through the quarter-wave matching layer. The incident wave from the tissue encounters an effective medium with impedance $Z_{in}$.\n\nThe pressure reflection coefficient $R$ at the tissue-matching layer interface ($x=0$) is found by applying the two-media formula derived previously, with $Z_1 = Z_t$ and $Z_2 = Z_{in}$:\n$$R = \\frac{Z_{in} - Z_t}{Z_{in} + Z_t} = \\frac{\\frac{Z_m^2}{Z_p} - Z_t}{\\frac{Z_m^2}{Z_p} + Z_t}$$\n$$R = \\frac{Z_m^2 - Z_t Z_p}{Z_m^2 + Z_t Z_p}$$\nThis completes the second part.\n\n### 3. Numerical Calculation and Explanation\n\nFirst, we compute the characteristic acoustic impedances ($Z = \\rho c$) for each material. The units are $\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-2} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$, or Rayl.\n- Soft Tissue: $Z_t = \\rho_t c_t = (1000 \\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-3})(1540 \\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) = 1.54 \\times 10^6 \\,\\text{Rayl}$\n- PZT: $Z_p = \\rho_p c_p = (7500 \\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-3})(4000 \\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) = 30.0 \\times 10^6 \\,\\text{Rayl}$\n- Matching Layer: $Z_m = \\rho_m c_m = (2500 \\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-3})(4000 \\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) = 10.0 \\times 10^6 \\,\\text{Rayl}$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the expression for the reflection coefficient $R$:\n$$Z_m^2 = (10.0 \\times 10^6)^2 = 100 \\times 10^{12} \\,\\text{Rayl}^2$$\n$$Z_t Z_p = (1.54 \\times 10^6)(30.0 \\times 10^6) = 46.2 \\times 10^{12} \\,\\text{Rayl}^2$$\n$$R = \\frac{100 \\times 10^{12} - 46.2 \\times 10^{12}}{100 \\times 10^{12} + 46.2 \\times 10^{12}} = \\frac{53.8 \\times 10^{12}}{146.2 \\times 10^{12}} = \\frac{53.8}{146.2} \\approx 0.367989$$\nThe problem asks for the amplitude of the reflection coefficient. Since all impedances are real (lossless media), $R$ is real, and its amplitude is $|R|$. Rounded to four significant figures, the value is $0.3680$. The frequency $f=5\\,\\text{MHz}$ confirms that the quarter-wave condition is met for a specific thickness, but its value does not enter the final calculation of $R$ at that frequency.\n\n**Explanation:**\nA matching layer reduces impedance mismatch by acting as an impedance transformer. The large reflection at a direct tissue-PZT interface arises from the significant difference between $Z_t$ ($1.54 \\times 10^6$ Rayl) and $Z_p$ ($30.0 \\times 10^6$ Rayl). The reflection coefficient for this direct interface would be:\n$$R_{\\text{direct}} = \\frac{Z_p - Z_t}{Z_p + Z_t} = \\frac{30.0 \\times 10^6 - 1.54 \\times 10^6}{30.0 \\times 10^6 + 1.54 \\times 10^6} = \\frac{28.46}{31.54} \\approx 0.9023$$\nThis corresponds to a reflection of over $90\\%$ of the incident pressure amplitude.\n\nAs derived, a quarter-wave layer transforms the load impedance $Z_p$ to an input impedance $Z_{in} = Z_m^2 / Z_p$. For perfect matching (zero reflection), we need $R=0$, which from the formula $R = (Z_{in} - Z_t) / (Z_{in} + Z_t)$ requires $Z_{in} = Z_t$. This implies:\n$$Z_t = \\frac{Z_m^2}{Z_p} \\implies Z_m = \\sqrt{Z_t Z_p}$$\nThe ideal matching layer impedance is the geometric mean of the impedances of the two media it connects. For this problem, the ideal impedance would be $Z_{m, \\text{ideal}} = \\sqrt{(1.54 \\times 10^6)(30.0 \\times 10^6)} \\approx 6.80 \\times 10^6$ Rayl.\n\nThe chosen matching layer has an impedance $Z_m = 10.0 \\times 10^6$ Rayl. This is not ideal, but it is much closer to the optimal value than either $Z_t$ or $Z_p$. It transforms the PZT impedance of $30.0 \\times 10^6$ Rayl to an effective input impedance of $Z_{in} = (10.0 \\times 10^6)^2 / (30.0 \\times 10^6) \\approx 3.33 \\times 10^6$ Rayl. This value is much closer to the tissue impedance $Z_t=1.54 \\times 10^6$ Rayl, thus significantly reducing the reflection coefficient from $0.9023$ to $0.3680$ and allowing more acoustic energy to be transmitted into the transducer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3680}$$", "id": "4934806"}]}
