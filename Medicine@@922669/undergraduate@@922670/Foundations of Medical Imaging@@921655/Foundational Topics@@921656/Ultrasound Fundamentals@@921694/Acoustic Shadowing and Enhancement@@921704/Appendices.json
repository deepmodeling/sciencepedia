The attenuation must be expressed in decibels (dB), while the decay factor is dimensionless.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of two quantities related to ultrasound attenuation: the total round-trip attenuation in decibels, and the corresponding intensity decay factor.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total attenuation. The problem provides a frequency-dependent attenuation coefficient, which we denote as $\\alpha_c$, for the soft tissue. The value is given as $\\alpha_c = 0.5 \\, \\text{dB} \\cdot \\text{cm}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{MHz}^{-1}$. The problem states that attenuation is linear in both propagation distance and frequency.\n\nThe total attenuation in decibels, which we will call $A_{\\text{total, dB}}$, is calculated using the formula:\n$$ A_{\\text{total, dB}} = \\alpha_c \\times x \\times f $$\nwhere $x$ is the total propagation distance and $f$ is the center frequency of the ultrasound pulse.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Center frequency, $f = 5 \\, \\text{MHz}$.\n- Attenuation coefficient, $\\alpha_c = 0.5 \\, \\text{dB} \\cdot \\text{cm}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{MHz}^{-1}$.\n- Axial depth of the target, $d = 6 \\, \\text{cm}$.\n\nThe ultrasound pulse travels from the transducer to the target and then reflects back to the transducer. This is a round-trip path. The total distance $x$ traveled by the pulse is therefore twice the axial depth $d$:\n$$ x = 2d = 2 \\times 6 \\, \\text{cm} = 12 \\, \\text{cm} $$\n\nWe can now substitute the numerical values of $\\alpha_c$, $x$, and $f$ into the attenuation formula:\n$$ A_{\\text{total, dB}} = (0.5 \\, \\text{dB} \\cdot \\text{cm}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{MHz}^{-1}) \\times (12 \\, \\text{cm}) \\times (5 \\, \\text{MHz}) $$\nThe units cancel out, leaving the result in decibels:\n$$ A_{\\text{total, dB}} = (0.5 \\times 12 \\times 5) \\, \\text{dB} = 30 \\, \\text{dB} $$\nThis is the first required quantity, the total round-trip attenuation.\n\nSecond, we determine the intensity decay factor. This factor is defined as the ratio of the returned intensity, $I_r$, to the emitted intensity, $I_e$. The definition of attenuation in decibels (dB) relates the intensity ratio to $A_{\\text{total, dB}}$:\n$$ A_{\\text{total, dB}} = 10 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{I_e}{I_r} \\right) $$\nWe have already calculated $A_{\\text{total, dB}} = 30 \\, \\text{dB}$. Substituting this value into the equation yields:\n$$ 30 = 10 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{I_e}{I_r} \\right) $$\nTo isolate the logarithmic term, we divide both sides by $10$:\n$$ 3 = \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{I_e}{I_r} \\right) $$\nTo solve for the intensity ratio, we apply the inverse function of the base-$10$ logarithm, which is exponentiation with base $10$, to both sides of the equation:\n$$ 10^3 = \\frac{I_e}{I_r} $$\n$$ 1000 = \\frac{I_e}{I_r} $$\nThe problem asks for the intensity decay factor, which is the ratio of the returned intensity to the emitted intensity, $\\frac{I_r}{I_e}$. This is the reciprocal of the ratio we have just calculated:\n$$ \\text{Intensity decay factor} = \\frac{I_r}{I_e} = \\frac{1}{1000} = 0.001 $$\nThis is the second required quantity.\n\nThe problem specifies that if rounding is needed, the result should be to four significant figures. The calculation from the given parameters yields exact results: $A_{\\text{total, dB}} = 30$ and the decay factor is $0.001$. To express these exact values to four significant figures, we write them as $30.00$ and $0.001000$.\n\nThe final results are an attenuation of $30.00 \\, \\text{dB}$ and a dimensionless intensity decay factor of $0.001000$.

The system's Time Gain Compensation (TGC) is calibrated so that, in this background, echoes from all depths are amplitude-equalized; that is, the TGC applies depth-dependent gain that exactly compensates the two-way (out-and-back) amplitude loss in the background medium.\n\nNow consider a planar lesion that fully occupies the ultrasound beam cross-section from the transducer surface down to a back face at depth $L=5$ centimeters (cm).

This mismatch arises because the system's Time Gain Compensation (TGC) is calibrated for a homogeneous background tissue, but the ultrasound pulse actually travels through a lesion with different attenuation properties.\n\nThe attenuation of ultrasound pressure amplitude, expressed in decibels (dB), is linearly proportional to the frequency $f$ and the propagation distance $z$.
