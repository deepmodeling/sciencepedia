The problem states that speed, $c$, is defined as the ratio of path length, $d$, to travel time, $t$. For a pulse-echo measurement, the ultrasound pulse travels from the transducer to the reflector and back again. The distance to the reflector is $r$. Therefore, the total path length traversed by the pulse is $d = 2r$. The total time for this round trip is the measured delay, $\\Delta t$. According to the definition of speed:\n$$c = \\frac{\\text{total path length}}{\\text{total travel time}} = \\frac{2r}{\\Delta t}$$\nSolving this equation for the axial range $r$ gives the desired expression:\n$$r = \\frac{c \\Delta t}{2}$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the axial range uncertainty $\\sigma_r$. The problem specifies using first-order propagation of uncertainty. The range $r$ is a function of the measured time delay $\\Delta t$, while the speed of sound $c$ is assumed to be a known constant without uncertainty. The relationship is $r(\\Delta t) = \\frac{c \\Delta t}{2}$.\nThe general formula for the propagation of uncertainty for a function $y = f(x)$ is given by $\\sigma_y^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{df}{dx}\\right)^2 \\sigma_x^2$, where $\\sigma_x$ is the uncertainty in $x$ and $\\sigma_y$ is the resulting uncertainty in $y$. Here, our function is $r(\\Delta t)$, the variable with uncertainty is $\\Delta t$ (with standard uncertainty $\\sigma_t$), and the resulting uncertainty is $\\sigma_r$.\nApplying the formula, we have:\n$$\\sigma_r^2 = \\left(\\frac{dr}{d(\\Delta t)}\\right)^2 \\sigma_t^2$$\nWe compute the derivative of $r$ with respect to $\\Delta t$:\n$$\\frac{dr}{d(\\Delta t)} = \\frac{d}{d(\\Delta t)} \\left(\\frac{c \\Delta t}{2}\\right) = \\frac{c}{2}$$\nSubstituting this derivative back into the uncertainty propagation equation:\n$$\\sigma_r^2 = \\left(\\frac{c}{2}\\right)^2 \\sigma_t^2$$\nTaking the square root of both sides yields the standard uncertainty in the axial range:\n$$\\sigma_r = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{c}{2}\\right)^2 \\sigma_t^2} = \\frac{c}{2} \\sigma_t$$\nThis is the required expression for the axial range uncertainty.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values for $r$ and $\\sigma_r$ using the provided data:\n$c = 1540\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$\n$\\Delta t = 130\\ \\mu\\mathrm{s} = 130 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n$\\sigma_t = 50\\ \\mathrm{ns} = 50 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n\nThe axial range $r$ is:\n$$r = \\frac{(1540\\ \\mathrm{m/s}) \\times (130 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s})}{2} = \\frac{200200 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{2} = 100100 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m} = 0.1001\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nThis is equivalent to $10.01\\ \\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nThe axial range uncertainty $\\sigma_r$ is:\n$$\\sigma_r = \\frac{1540\\ \\mathrm{m/s}}{2} \\times (50 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}) = (770\\ \\mathrm{m/s}) \\times (50 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}) = 38500 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m} = 3.85 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nThe problem asks for this value to be expressed in micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}$). Since $1\\ \\mathrm{m} = 10^6\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$, we have:\n$$\\sigma_r = 3.85 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m} \\times \\frac{10^6\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}}{1\\ \\mathrm{m}} = 38.5\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nRounding this to four significant figures as requested gives $38.50\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nFinally, a comment on the influence of $\\sigma_t$ on axial resolution. Axial resolution refers to the minimum separation between two reflectors along the beam axis that allows them to be distinguished as separate objects. The uncertainty in the arrival time of an echo, $\\sigma_t$, causes an uncertainty in the calculated position of the reflector, $\\sigma_r = \\frac{c\\sigma_t}{2}$. This range uncertainty $\\sigma_r$ represents a fundamental limit on the precision with which any single target can be located. Consequently, if two targets are separated by a distance comparable to or less than $\\sigma_r$, their estimated positions will be \"blurred\" to such an extent that their representations will merge, making them indistinguishable. Therefore, a smaller timing uncertainty $\\sigma_t$, which can be achieved with shorter pulses and higher-bandwidth electronics, leads directly to a smaller range uncertainty $\\sigma_r$ and thus improves (i.e., decreases the minimum distance for) axial resolution.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{38.50}\n$$", "id": "4935238"}, {"introduction": "Ultrasound images are not perfect representations of anatomy; they contain artifacts that arise from the physics of wave propagation.

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and a clear objective. The language is precise and objective, and the provided numerical values are physically realistic for soft tissue.\n\nWe shall address the problem in three parts as requested: an explanation of the physical mechanism, a derivation of the inter-echo spacing, and a numerical calculation.\n\n**1. Physical Mechanism of Echo Train Formation**\n\nAn echo train arises from multiple reflections of an ultrasonic pulse within a layer bounded by two interfaces with different acoustic impedances. The process unfolds as follows:\n\n-   An initial ultrasonic pulse is emitted by the transducer and enters the layer at the first interface, located at $z=0$. Since the transducer is at this interface, this is the reference point for time and position.\n-   The pulse propagates through the layer, which has a thickness $d$ and a sound speed $c_{\\text{layer}}$. It travels from $z=0$ to the second interface at $z=d$.\n-   At the interface $z=d$, the acoustic impedance mismatch causes a portion of the pulse's energy to be reflected back towards the transducer (i.e., towards $z=0$). The remaining energy is transmitted through the interface.\n-   The first reflected portion travels back from $z=d$ to $z=0$. Upon arriving at $z=0$, a part of its energy is transmitted out of the layer and detected by the transducer. This detected signal is the first echo, $E_1$. The total path length for this echo is $d$ (out) $+ d$ (back) $= 2d$.\n-   Due to the impedance mismatch at the $z=0$ interface, another portion of the energy of this returning wave is not transmitted but is instead reflected *back into the layer*. This is an internal reflection, sometimes called a reverberation.\n-   This re-reflected pulse now travels once more through the layer from $z=0$ to $z=d$, reflects off the interface at $z=d$, and returns again to $z=0$. This completes a second full round trip within the layer.\n-   When this pulse arrives at $z=0$ for the second time, a fraction of its energy again escapes and is detected by the transducer, forming the second echo, $E_2$.\n-   This process repeats. The energy trapped within the layer undergoes successive round trips, and at each arrival at the $z=0$ interface, a fraction of the remaining energy \"leaks\" out to be detected as an echo. This sequence of echoes, $E_1, E_2, E_3, \\dots$, which are progressively weaker and arrive at regular time intervals, is called an echo train or multiple reverberations. The problem's condition that the pulse duration is much shorter than the round-trip time ensures that these successive echoes are distinct and do not overlap, making them temporally resolvable.\n\n**2. Derivation of Inter-Echo Spacing**\n\nThe time-of-flight, $t$, for a pulse to travel a certain path length is defined as the path length divided by the speed of propagation. The inter-echo spacing, which we will denote as $\\Delta t$, is the time difference between the arrival of any two consecutive echoes.\n\nLet $t_n$ be the arrival time of the $n$-th echo, where $n$ is a positive integer ($n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$).\n\n-   The first echo, $E_1$, corresponds to the pulse completing exactly one round trip within the layer.\n    The path length for the first echo is $2d$.\n    The arrival time is $t_1 = \\frac{2d}{c_{\\text{layer}}}$.\n\n-   The second echo, $E_2$, corresponds to the pulse completing two full round trips within the layer.\n    The total path length for the second echo is $2 \\times (2d) = 4d$.\n    The arrival time is $t_2 = \\frac{4d}{c_{\\text{layer}}}$.\n\n-   Generalizing, the $n$-th echo, $E_n$, is detected after the pulse has completed $n$ round trips within the layer.\n    The total path length for the $n$-th echo is $n \\times (2d)$.\n    The arrival time is $t_n = \\frac{n(2d)}{c_{\\text{layer}}}$.\n\nThe inter-echo spacing, $\\Delta t$, is the time difference between two successive echoes, $E_n$ and $E_{n-1}$.\n$$ \\Delta t = t_n - t_{n-1} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $t_n$ and $t_{n-1}$:\n$$ \\Delta t = \\frac{n(2d)}{c_{\\text{layer}}} - \\frac{(n-1)(2d)}{c_{\\text{layer}}} $$\nFactoring out the common term $\\frac{2d}{c_{\\text{layer}}}$:\n$$ \\Delta t = \\left( \\frac{2d}{c_{\\text{layer}}} \\right) [n - (n-1)] $$\n$$ \\Delta t = \\left( \\frac{2d}{c_{\\text{layer}}} \\right) (1) $$\nTherefore, the inter-echo spacing is constant and is given by the time required for a single round trip within the layer:\n$$ \\Delta t = \\frac{2d}{c_{\\text{layer}}} $$\n\n**3.

Decision rule: If an echo occurs at an apparent depth equal to an integer multiple of $d_s$ (for the first reverberation, $2 d_s$), and its amplitude is consistent with the chain $|r_s|^2 |r_x|$ relative to the direct strong echo after accounting for additional attenuation over the extra path, classify it as a reverberation; otherwise, classify it as a true shallow target.**\n\n- **Amplitude Ratio**: The calculated ratio of $\\approx 0.62$ is **Correct**.\n- **Decision Rule**: This rule describes the canonical method for identifying reverberation artifacts. Reverberations are characterized by their spatial periodicity. The first reverberation artifact from a reflector at depth $d_s$ appears at an apparent depth of $2d_s$, the second at $3d_s$, and so on. An operator can identify a strong shallow reflector at $d_s$ and then look for these \"ghost\" echoes at integer multiples of that depth. The check on amplitude consistency, while slightly imprecisely worded (it seems to be describing the calculation of $A_{rev}$ itself rather than its relation to the primary echo $A_s$), captures the correct physical principle: the amplitude of the reverberation must be physically plausible given the primary echo's strength and the extra path and reflections it has undergone. This rule is principled and practical.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. $A_{\\mathrm{weak}} / A_{\\mathrm{rev}} \\approx 1.62$. Decision rule: Increase bandwidth $B$ to resolve the two echoes in time; if they separate, classify by arrival time, and if not, classify the stronger as the true target.**\n\n- **Amplitude Ratio**: The ratio $1.62$ is the inverse of the correct value ($A_{\\mathrm{rev}} / A_{\\mathrm{weak}}$). **Incorrect**.\n- **Decision Rule**: The rule is fundamentally flawed. The two echoes are generated by physical processes that result in signals arriving at the exact same time ($t = 2d_t/c = 4d_s/c$). They are not two closely-spaced targets that can be resolved by improving axial resolution (which is what increasing bandwidth does). Since the arrival times are identical, they can never be separated in time. Furthermore, the heuristic \"classify the stronger as the true target\" is arbitrary and, in this case, would lead to the wrong conclusion, as the reverberation artifact is the stronger echo.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $A_{\\mathrm{weak}} / A_{\\mathrm{rev}} \\approx 0.10$. Decision rule: Apply depth gating to exclude all echoes deeper than $d_t$.**\n\n- **Amplitude Ratio**: The value $0.10$ corresponds to $r_t$, not the calculated ratio. **Incorrect**.\n- **Decision Rule**: This rule is nonsensical. The ambiguity occurs precisely *at* the apparent depth $d_t = 3.0 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$. Applying a gate to exclude echoes from *deeper* regions has no effect on the signal being analyzed at $d_t$. Both the true echo and the artifact fall within the acceptance region. This rule does not address the problem of disambiguation.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $A_{\\mathrm{weak}} / A_{\\mathrm{rev}} \\approx 0.62$. Decision rule: Rely on logarithmic compression to suppress strong echoes; whichever echo survives compression is the true shallow target.**\n\n- **Amplitude Ratio**: The calculated ratio of $\\approx 0.62$ is **Correct**.\n- **Decision Rule**: This rule is based on a misunderstanding of logarithmic compression. Log compression is a function applied to the signal amplitudes to map a large dynamic range to a smaller, displayable range (e.g., 8-bit grayscale). It makes weak signals more visible relative to strong signals, but it does *not* \"suppress\" or \"eliminate\" strong signals. All signals \"survive\" compression, just with their relative amplitudes altered non-linearly. The concept of an echo \"surviving\" compression is physically meaningless. Moreover, since the reverberation echo is stronger, any simple amplitude-based rule would be unreliable.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nOnly option A provides both the correct numerical ratio and a decision rule that is based on sound physical principles and standard sonographic practice for identifying artifacts.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4935232"}]}
