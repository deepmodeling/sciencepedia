We consider a plane acoustic wave at normal incidence.\n\nLet $Z_p$ be the specific acoustic impedance of the piezoelectric element and $Z_b$ be that of the backing. At the interface, the boundary conditions require the continuity of pressure and particle velocity.\n1.  Continuity of pressure: $p_i + p_r = p_t$\n2.  Continuity of particle velocity: $v_i + v_r = v_t$\n\nHere, the subscripts $i, r, t$ denote the incident, reflected, and transmitted waves, respectively. The specific acoustic impedance $Z$ is defined as the ratio of pressure to particle velocity, $Z = p/v$. For a forward-propagating wave, $v = p/Z$, and for a backward-propagating wave, $v = -p/Z$. Applying this:\n$v_i = p_i / Z_p$, $v_r = -p_r / Z_p$, and $v_t = p_t / Z_b$.\n\nSubstituting these into the velocity continuity equation gives:\n$$\\frac{p_i}{Z_p} - \\frac{p_r}{Z_p} = \\frac{p_t}{Z_b}$$\nSubstitute $p_t = p_i + p_r$ from the pressure continuity equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{Z_p}(p_i - p_r) = \\frac{1}{Z_b}(p_i + p_r)$$\nSolving for the pressure reflection coefficient, $R_p = p_r / p_i$:\n$$Z_b(p_i - p_r) = Z_p(p_i + p_r) \\implies p_i (Z_b - Z_p) = p_r (Z_p + Z_b) \\implies R_p = \\frac{p_r}{p_i} = \\frac{Z_b - Z_p}{Z_b + Z_p}$$\nThe intensity (or energy) reflection coefficient, $R$, is the square of the pressure reflection coefficient:\n$$R = (R_p)^2 = \\left(\\frac{Z_b - Z_p}{Z_b + Z_p}\\right)^2$$\n\n**Derivation of the Normalized Ring-Down Time Constant ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{norm}}$)**\nThe decay of stored energy $E(t)$ is modeled as $dE/dt = -\\gamma E$, which has an exponential solution $E(t) = E(0) \\exp(-\\gamma t)$.
