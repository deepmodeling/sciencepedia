This is given by the total distance traveled, $2z$, divided by the speed of sound, $c$.\n    $$T_{\\text{echo}}(z) = \\frac{2z}{c}$$\n    To avoid range ambiguity, the system must wait for the echo from the maximum imaging depth, $z_{\\max}$, to return before transmitting the next pulse.

The problem states that one pulse is transmitted per scan line. Therefore, the time required to acquire all the lines for a single frame, the frame time ($T_{\\text{frame}}$), is the product of the number of lines and the time per line ($T_{\\text{PRF}}$).\n    $$T_{\\text{frame}} = N_{\\text{lines}} \\times T_{\\text{PRF}}$$\n    The frame rate, $F$, is the number of frames acquired per second, which is the inverse of the frame time.\n    $$F = \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{frame}}} = \\frac{1}{N_{\\text{lines}} \\times T_{\\text{PRF}}}$$\n    Expressing this in terms of $\\text{PRF}$ by substituting $T_{\\text{PRF}} = \\frac{1}{\\text{PRF}}$ yields:\n    $$F = \\frac{1}{N_{\\text{lines}} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\text{PRF}}\\right)} = \\frac{\\text{PRF}}{N_{\\text{lines}}}$$\n    This expression for the frame rate, $F = \\frac{\\text{PRF}}{N_{\\text{lines}}}$, coupled with the constraint $\\text{PRF} \\le \\frac{c}{2 z_{\\max}}$, constitutes the general relationship requested by the problem.

To create a diagnostically useful B-mode image where brightness reflects tissue properties rather than depth, this effect must be counteracted.

The amplitude, $A$, decays exponentially with path length, $d$. The amplitude at a distance $d$, $A(d)$, can be written in terms of the initial amplitude, $A_0$, as:\n$$A(d) = A_0 \\exp(-\\alpha_{Np} d)$$\nwhere $\\alpha_{Np}$ is the attenuation coefficient in units of nepers per unit length.\n\nFor an echo originating from a depth $z$, the ultrasound pulse travels a total two-way path length of $d = 2z$. Therefore, the received echo amplitude, $A_{rx}(z)$, is:\n$$A_{rx}(z) = A_0(z) \\exp(-\\alpha_{Np} \\cdot 2z)$$\nHere, $A_0(z)$ represents the initial amplitude of the echo generated at depth $z$, which depends on the reflectivity of the tissue at that depth. The goal of TGC is to compensate for the exponential decay factor, such that the compensated signal amplitude is proportional to $A_0(z)$ alone, independent of depth.\n\nThe TGC gain, $G(z)$, is a multiplicative factor applied to the received signal. For perfect compensation, the product of the received amplitude and the gain must be equal to the initial echo amplitude:\n$$A_{rx}(z) \\cdot G(z) = A_0(z)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $A_{rx}(z)$:\n$$A_0(z) \\exp(-\\alpha_{Np} \\cdot 2z) \\cdot G(z) = A_0(z)$$\nSolving for $G(z)$, we find:\n$$G(z) = \\frac{1}{\\exp(-\\alpha_{Np} \\cdot 2z)} = \\exp(\\alpha_{Np} \\cdot 2z)$$\nThis confirms that the required gain is an exponential function of depth. The problem states that this gain is applied in the natural exponential (neper) domain, which is consistent with this functional form.\n\nNext, we must determine the value of the attenuation coefficient $\\alpha_{Np}$ in the correct units (nepers per centimeter). The problem provides the attenuation coefficient, $\\alpha$, in mixed units: $\\alpha = 0.7$ dB/(cm·MHz). The center frequency is given as $f_0 = 5$ MHz.\n\nThe attenuation in decibels per centimeter at this frequency is:\n$$\\alpha_{dB/cm} = \\alpha \\cdot f_0$$\nTo use this in our exponential gain formula, we must convert from decibels to nepers. The relationship between a loss expressed in decibels ($L_{dB}$) and the same loss in nepers ($L_{Np}$) for an amplitude ratio is given by the definitions:\n$$L_{dB} = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{A_0}{A}\\right)$$\n$$L_{Np} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_0}{A}\\right)$$\nFrom the second equation, $\\frac{A_0}{A} = \\exp(L_{Np})$. Substituting this into the first equation:\n$$L_{dB} = 20 \\log_{10}(\\exp(L_{Np})) = 20 L_{Np} \\log_{10}(e)$$\nThe conversion factor from nepers to decibels is $20 \\log_{10}(e)$. To convert from decibels to nepers, we use the inverse relationship:\n$$L_{Np} = \\frac{L_{dB}}{20 \\log_{10}(e)} = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{20} L_{dB}$$\nTherefore, to convert the attenuation coefficient from dB/cm to Np/cm, we apply this factor:\n$$\\alpha_{Np/cm} = \\alpha_{dB/cm} \\cdot \\frac{\\ln(10)}{20} = (\\alpha \\cdot f_0) \\frac{\\ln(10)}{20}$$\n\nNow, we can write the complete expression for the gain $G(z)$. The variable $z$ is measured in centimeters, and our coefficient $\\alpha_{Np/cm}$ is in nepers per centimeter, making the exponent dimensionless as required.\n$$G(z) = \\exp(\\alpha_{Np/cm} \\cdot 2z) = \\exp\\left( (\\alpha \\cdot f_0 \\cdot \\frac{\\ln(10)}{20}) \\cdot 2z \\right)$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$G(z) = \\exp\\left( \\frac{2 \\alpha f_0 \\ln(10)}{20} z \\right) = \\exp\\left( \\frac{\\alpha f_0 \\ln(10)}{10} z \\right)$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values for $\\alpha$ and $f_0$:\n$$\\alpha = 0.7$$\n$$f_0 = 5$$\nThe coefficient of $z$ in the exponent is:\n$$\\frac{\\alpha f_0 \\ln(10)}{10} = \\frac{0.7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot \\ln(10)}{10} = \\frac{3.5 \\ln(10)}{10} = 0.35 \\ln(10)$$\nTo express this in exact fractional form as requested, we write $0.35$ as $\\frac{35}{100} = \\frac{7}{20}$.\nSo, the coefficient is $\\frac{7}{20} \\ln(10)$.\n\nThe final closed-form analytic expression for the TGC gain as a function of depth $z$ (in cm) is:\n$$G(z) = \\exp\\left( \\frac{7 \\ln(10)}{20} z \\right)$$\nThis function is valid for the specified imaging depth range of $0 \\leq z \\leq 12$.

The layer is bounded by two parallel, plane interfaces: the proximal interface at $x=0$ (the medium-to-transducer boundary upon return) and the distal interface at $x=d$ (a strong reflector within the body). Let the acoustic impedances on either side of the distal interface be $Z_1$ (the layer) and $Z_2$ (the reflector), and define the pressure reflection coefficient at normal incidence as $r_d = (Z_2 - Z_1)/(Z_2 + Z_1)$. When echoes returning from the distal interface reach $x=0$, a fraction is detected and a fraction is re-reflected back into the layer; denote the in-layer reflection coefficient at $x=0$ for waves incident from within the layer by $r_0$ with $0 < |r_0| < 1$.

Then determine how these echoes appear in Amplitude mode (A-mode) and Brightness mode (B-mode) displays, including both their delay spacing and their amplitude progression.\n\nWhich option best captures the mechanism and the display appearance for this two-interface reverberation scenario?\n\nA. The reverberation mechanism is repeated back-and-forth propagation between the interfaces at $x=0$ and $x=d$, so the $n$-th echo arrives at delays $t_n = 2 n d / c$ with successive amplitude ratio $A_{n+1}/A_n = |r_0 r_d| \\exp(-2 \\alpha d)$.

The echo delays are $t_n = n d / c$ because only the forward path contributes; the amplitudes remain approximately constant across $n$ due to constructive interference.

The initial pulse of amplitude $A_0$ is emitted at time $t=0$.\n\n**1. The First Echo ($n=1$)**\n-   The pulse propagates from $x=0$ to $x=d$. The travel time is $\\Delta t = d/c$. The amplitude is attenuated by a factor of $\\exp(-\\alpha d)$.\n-   At $x=d$, the pulse reflects. Its amplitude is multiplied by the reflection coefficient $r_d$.\n-   The reflected pulse propagates from $x=d$ back to $x=0$. The travel time is again $\\Delta t = d/c$, and the amplitude is further attenuated by $\\exp(-\\alpha d)$.\n-   The total round-trip time for the first echo is $t_1 = d/c + d/c = 2d/c$.\n-   The total distance traveled is $2d$.\n-   The amplitude of the pulse arriving back at $x=0$ is $A'_1 = A_0 \\cdot \\exp(-\\alpha d) \\cdot r_d \\cdot \\exp(-\\alpha d) = A_0 r_d \\exp(-2\\alpha d)$.\n-   The amplitude detected by the A-mode or B-mode system is the magnitude of this pressure wave, $A_1 = |A_0 r_d \\exp(-2\\alpha d)|$.\n\n**2. The Second Echo ($n=2$, the first reverberation)**\n-   The first echo wave, upon arriving at $x=0$ with amplitude $A'_1$, is partially reflected back into the layer. The reflection coefficient at this interface is $r_0$.\n-   The amplitude of this re-reflected wave is $A'_1 \\cdot r_0 = A_0 r_d r_0 \\exp(-2\\alpha d)$.\n-   This new pulse now undergoes another full round-trip: it travels to $x=d$, reflects (factor $r_d$), and returns to $x=0$. This process is identical to the one for the first echo.\n-   This second round-trip adds an additional time delay of $2d/c$ and multiplies the amplitude by a factor of $r_d \\exp(-2\\alpha d)$.\n-   The total time of flight for the second echo is $t_2 = t_1 + 2d/c = 2d/c + 2d/c = 4d/c$.\n-   The amplitude of the second echo arriving at $x=0$ is $A'_2 = (A'_1 \\cdot r_0) \\cdot (r_d \\exp(-2\\alpha d)) = (A_0 r_d r_0 \\exp(-2\\alpha d)) \\cdot (r_d \\exp(-2\\alpha d)) = A_0 r_0 r_d^2 \\exp(-4\\alpha d)$.\n-   The detected amplitude is $A_2 = |A_0 r_0 r_d^2 \\exp(-4\\alpha d)|$.\n\n**3. The $n$-th Echo (General Case)**\n-   By induction, the $n$-th echo is the result of the $(n-1)$-th echo re-reflecting at $x=0$ and making one more round trip.\n-   Each additional round trip adds $2d/c$ to the total time. The time of arrival for the $n$-th echo is $t_n = n \\cdot (2d/c) = 2nd/c$.\n-   Each round trip (from $x=0$, to $d$, and back to $0$) involves one reflection at $x=d$ (factor $r_d$) and propagation over a distance $2d$ (factor $\\exp(-2\\alpha d)$). The re-reflection at $x=0$ to initiate the next round trip involves a factor of $r_0$.\n-   The amplitude of the $n$-th echo is a result of one initial path, followed by $(n-1)$ reverberation cycles. This involves $n$ reflections at $x=d$ and $(n-1)$ reflections at $x=0$.\n-   The amplitude arriving at $x=0$ is $A'_n = A_0 (r_d \\exp(-2\\alpha d)) (r_0 r_d \\exp(-2\\alpha d))^{n-1} = A_0 r_0^{n-1} r_d^n \\exp(-2n\\alpha d)$.\n-   The detected amplitude is $A_n = |A_0 r_0^{n-1} r_d^n \\exp(-2n\\alpha d)|$.\n\n**4. Ratio of Successive Echo Amplitudes**\n-   The ratio of the amplitude of the $(n+1)$-th echo to the $n$-th echo is:\n    $$ \\frac{A_{n+1}}{A_n} = \\frac{|A_0 r_0^{n} r_d^{n+1} \\exp(-2(n+1)\\alpha d)|}{|A_0 r_0^{n-1} r_d^{n} \\exp(-2n\\alpha d)|} = |r_0 r_d| \\exp(-2\\alpha d) $$\n-   This ratio is constant for all successive echoes. Since $|r_0|<1$, $|r_d| \\le 1$, and $\\exp(-2\\alpha d) < 1$ (for $d>0, \\alpha \\ge 0$), this ratio is less than $1$, meaning the amplitudes decay.\n\n**5. Display Appearance**\n-   Ultrasound systems calculate apparent depth $z$ from the round-trip time $t$ using the formula $z = ct/2$.\n-   For the $n$-th echo, the arrival time is $t_n = 2nd/c$. The apparent depth is $z_n = c \\cdot t_n / 2 = c \\cdot (2nd/c) / 2 = nd$.\n-   This means the echoes are displayed at depths of $d, 2d, 3d, \\dots$. They are equally spaced by the distance $d$.\n-   **A-mode (Amplitude Mode):** This mode plots echo amplitude versus apparent depth. The display will show a sequence of aperiodic spikes at depths $z=d, 2d, 3d, \\dots$. The height of the spike at depth $nd$ will be proportional to $A_n$. The heights will decay exponentially.\n-   **B-mode (Brightness Mode):** In this mode, amplitude is encoded as brightness. For a single scan line, the display will show a series of bright dots at depths $d, 2d, 3d, \\dots$, with brightness decreasing with depth. When imaging a planar reflector, this pattern is repeated for all scan lines, creating a series of parallel bright lines. For a small reflector or when $d$ is small, this series of decaying bright spots is often called a \"comet-tail\" artifact.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. The reverberation mechanism is repeated back-and-forth propagation between the interfaces at $x=0$ and $x=d$, so the $n$-th echo arrives at delays $t_n = 2 n d / c$ with successive amplitude ratio $A_{n+1}/A_n = |r_0 r_d| \\exp(-2 \\alpha d)$. In A-mode, these form a periodic train of spikes at depths $n d$ with decaying height; in B-mode, they appear as equally spaced bright replicas along the beam direction at depths $n d$ with diminishing brightness (a “comet-tail”-like artifact for small $d$).**\n-   **Analysis:** This statement perfectly matches the results of our derivation. The mechanism, the echo timing ($t_n = 2nd/c$), the amplitude ratio ($|r_0 r_d| \\exp(-2\\alpha d)$), the apparent depths ($z_n = nd$), and the descriptions of A-mode and B-mode appearances are all correct.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. The echo delays are $t_n = n d / c$ because only the forward path contributes; the amplitudes remain approximately constant across $n$ due to constructive interference. In A-mode, a single strong spike thickens; in B-mode, only the primary reflector brightens without replicated features.**\n-   **Analysis:** The delay $t_n$ is incorrect; it must be a round-trip time, $2nd/c$. The claim of constant amplitude is incorrect; attenuation and reflection losses ($|r_0| < 1$) ensure decay. The description of a single thickening spike or no replicas is contrary to the mechanism of reverberation, which produces multiple, discrete echoes.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The reverberation period is set by the Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF), so $t_n \\approx n / f_{\\mathrm{PRF}}$ independent of $d$; attenuation mainly randomizes amplitudes. In A-mode, echoes appear irregularly; in B-mode, the artifact manifests as speckle rather than discrete replicas.**\n-   **Analysis:** This confuses reverberation artifact with range-ambiguity artifact. The reverberation period is $2d/c$, which depends on the local geometry ($d$) and material properties ($c$), not the system's PRF. Attenuation is a deterministic process, not random. The resulting echoes are periodic, not irregular, and form discrete replicas, not speckle.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The delays satisfy $t_n = 2 n d / c$, but successive amplitudes grow as $A_{n+1}/A_n = \\exp(+2 \\alpha d)$ because attenuation is compensated by multiple reflections. In A-mode, the later spikes become taller; in B-mode, deeper replicas become brighter than shallow ones.**\n-   **Analysis:** The delay formula is correct. However, the claim of growing amplitude is a violation of the principle of conservation of energy. Attenuation is a loss mechanism, and reflection at a passive interface cannot create energy ($|r_0| \\le 1, |r_d| \\le 1$). Amplitudes must decay.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The echo timing depends on the angular scanning, producing slanted features in time; in A-mode, the reverberations smear laterally; in B-mode, the artifact appears as oblique streaks whose spacing varies with scan angle rather than $d$.**\n-   **Analysis:** This option introduces angular effects, which are explicitly excluded by the problem statement (\"ignore beam diffraction and angular effects\"). The fundamental reverberation artifact from parallel reflectors, as described, produces replicas along the beam axis, not oblique or slanted features.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4859868"}]}
