A plane wave propagates in the $+x$ direction in medium $1$.\n\nThe incident, reflected, and transmitted acoustic pressure waves can be represented in complex notation as:\n- Incident wave ($x0$): $p_i(x,t) = P_i \\exp(j(\\omega t - k_1 x))$\n- Reflected wave ($x0$): $p_r(x,t) = P_r \\exp(j(\\omega t + k_1 x))$\n- Transmitted wave ($x0$): $p_t(x,t) = P_t \\exp(j(\\omega t - k_2 x))$\nwhere $P_i$, $P_r$, and $P_t$ are the complex pressure amplitudes, $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ is the angular frequency, and $k_1 = \\omega/c_1$ and $k_2 = \\omega/c_2$ are the wavenumbers in medium $1$ and medium $2$, respectively.\n\nThe acoustic impedance $Z$ is defined as the ratio of pressure amplitude to particle velocity amplitude, $Z = p/u$. For a plane wave in a lossless medium, the acoustic impedance is the product of the medium's density $\\rho$ and speed of sound $c$, i.e., $Z = \\rho c$. This can be shown from the one-dimensional linearized Euler's equation (equation of motion): $\\rho \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}$.\nFor a forward-propagating wave $p(x,t) = f(t - x/c)$, we get $\\rho \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -(-\\frac{1}{c})f'(t - x/c) = \\frac{1}{c}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}$. Integrating with respect to time yields $\\rho u = p/c$, so $Z = p/u = \\rho c$.\nFor a backward-propagating wave $p(x,t) = g(t + x/c)$, the same derivation leads to $\\rho u = -p/c$, so $u = -p/Z$.\n\nThe particle velocities associated with each wave are:\n- Incident velocity: $u_i(x,t) = \\frac{P_i}{Z_1} \\exp(j(\\omega t - k_1 x))$\n- Reflected velocity: $u_r(x,t) = -\\frac{P_r}{Z_1} \\exp(j(\\omega t + k_1 x))$ (negative sign due to propagation in $-x$ direction)\n- Transmitted velocity: $u_t(x,t) = \\frac{P_t}{Z_2} \\exp(j(\\omega t - k_2 x))$\nHere, $Z_1 = \\rho_1 c_1$ and $Z_2 = \\rho_2 c_2$.\n\nAt the interface $x=0$, the acoustic pressure and the normal component of particle velocity must be continuous.\nContinuity of pressure at $x=0$:\n$p_i(0,t) + p_r(0,t) = p_t(0,t)$\n$P_i \\exp(j\\omega t) + P_r \\exp(j\\omega t) = P_t \\exp(j\\omega t)$\n$$P_i + P_r = P_t \\quad (1)$$\n\nContinuity of normal particle velocity at $x=0$:\n$u_i(0,t) + u_r(0,t) = u_t(0,t)$\n$\\frac{P_i}{Z_1} \\exp(j\\omega t) - \\frac{P_r}{Z_1} \\exp(j\\omega t) = \\frac{P_t}{Z_2} \\exp(j\\omega t)$\n$$\\frac{P_i - P_r}{Z_1} = \\frac{P_t}{Z_2} \\quad (2)$$\n\nWe now solve this system of two linear equations for the pressure reflection coefficient, $R_p = P_r/P_i$.

Quarter-wavelength thickness at $f_0$: $d = \\frac{c_m}{4f_0}$.\n\nLet's substitute these into the terms of the denominator of $\\mathcal{T}(\\omega)$. The second term in the parenthesis is:\n$$\n\\frac{Z_1}{Z_m} + \\frac{Z_m}{Z_2} = \\frac{Z_1}{\\sqrt{Z_1 Z_2}} + \\frac{\\sqrt{Z_1 Z_2}}{Z_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{Z_1}{Z_2}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{Z_1}{Z_2}} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{Z_1}{Z_2}}\n$$\nThe argument of the trigonometric functions is $k_m d = (2\\pi f/c_m) \\cdot (c_m/(4f_0)) = \\frac{\\pi f}{2f_0}$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the transmission at the fundamental frequency, $f = f_0$.\nAt $f=f_0$, the argument $k_m d = \\frac{\\pi f_0}{2f_0} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nThus, $\\cos(k_m d) = \\cos(\\pi/2) = 0$ and $\\sin(k_m d) = \\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$.\nThe amplitude transmission coefficient at $f_0$ is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{T}(f_0) = \\frac{2}{0 \\cdot (1 + Z_1/Z_2) + i \\cdot 1 \\cdot (Z_1/Z_m + Z_m/Z_2)} = \\frac{2}{i(2\\sqrt{Z_1/Z_2})} = \\frac{1}{i\\sqrt{Z_1/Z_2}} = -i\\sqrt{\\frac{Z_2}{Z_1}}\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze the transmission at the second harmonic frequency, $f = 2f_0$.\nAt $f=2f_0$, the argument $k_m d = \\frac{\\pi (2f_0)}{2f_0} = \\pi$.\nThus, $\\cos(k_m d) = \\cos(\\pi) = -1$ and $\\sin(k_m d) = \\sin(\\pi) = 0$.\nThe amplitude transmission coefficient at $2f_0$ is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{T}(2f_0) = \\frac{2}{(-1) \\cdot (1 + Z_1/Z_2) + i \\cdot 0 \\cdot (Z_1/Z_m + Z_m/Z_2)} = \\frac{-2}{1 + Z_1/Z_2} = \\frac{-2Z_2}{Z_2 + Z_1}\n$$\n\nThe time-averaged intensity $I$ of a plane wave is related to the pressure amplitude $p_{amp}$ and the medium's impedance $Z$ by $I = \\frac{p_{amp}^2}{2Z}$. The intensity transmission coefficient, $\\alpha_t$, is the ratio of the transmitted intensity $I_t$ in medium $2$ to the incident intensity $I_i$ in medium $1$:\n$$\n\\alpha_t = \\frac{I_t}{I_i} = \\frac{|p_t|^2 / (2Z_2)}{|p_i|^2 / (2Z_1)} = \\left| \\frac{p_t}{p_i} \\right|^2 \\frac{Z_1}{Z_2} = |\\mathcal{T}|^2 \\frac{Z_1}{Z_2}\n$$\n\nThe intensity transmission coefficient at $f_0$ is:\n$$\n\\alpha_t(f_0) = |\\mathcal{T}(f_0)|^2 \\frac{Z_1}{Z_2} = \\left| -i\\sqrt{\\frac{Z_2}{Z_1}} \\right|^2 \\frac{Z_1}{Z_2} = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{Z_2}{Z_1}}\\right)^2 \\frac{Z_1}{Z_2} = \\frac{Z_2}{Z_1} \\frac{Z_1}{Z_2} = 1\n$$\nThis confirms perfect transmission at the design frequency, as expected for an ideal quarter-wave matching layer.\n\nThe intensity transmission coefficient at $2f_0$ is:\n$$\n\\alpha_t(2f_0) = |\\mathcal{T}(2f_0)|^2 \\frac{Z_1}{Z_2} = \\left| \\frac{-2Z_2}{Z_1 + Z_2} \\right|^2 \\frac{Z_1}{Z_2} = \\frac{4Z_2^2}{(Z_1 + Z_2)^2} \\frac{Z_1}{Z_2} = \\frac{4Z_1 Z_2}{(Z_1 + Z_2)^2}\n$$\nThis is the same as the transmission for a single interface, because a half-wavelength layer ($d = \\lambda_m/2$ at $2f_0$) is acoustically transparent.\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the transmitted time-averaged intensity at $2f_0$ to that at $f_0$. Assuming the same incident intensity $I_i$ for both frequencies:\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{I_t(2f_0)}{I_t(f_0)} = \\frac{\\alpha_t(2f_0) \\cdot I_i}{\\alpha_t(f_0) \\cdot I_i} = \\frac{\\alpha_t(2f_0)}{\\alpha_t(f_0)} = \\frac{\\frac{4Z_1 Z_2}{(Z_1 + Z_2)^2}}{1} = \\frac{4Z_1 Z_2}{(Z_1 + Z_2)^2}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$Z_1 = 30 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$\n$Z_2 = 1.5 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$\n\nThe factors of $10^6$ will cancel in the ratio:\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{4(30)(1.5)}{(30 + 1.5)^2} = \\frac{180}{31.5^2} = \\frac{180}{992.25}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} \\approx 0.181403022...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.1814$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1814}$$", "id": "4918579"}]}
