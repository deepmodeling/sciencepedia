A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe solution is developed in three parts, corresponding to the three quantities requested.\n\n**1. Total Amplitude Attenuation in Decibels**\n\nThe frequency-dependent attenuation coefficient, $\\alpha$, is given in units of decibels per unit length per unit frequency. The total attenuation, $A_{\\text{dB}}$, along a path of length $L$ for a wave of frequency $f$ is therefore the product of these three quantities:\n$$\nA_{\\text{dB}} = \\alpha \\times f \\times L\n$$\nSubstituting the given values into this equation:\n-   $\\alpha = 0.3\\,\\text{dB}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}\\,\\text{MHz}^{-1}$\n-   $f = 2\\,\\text{MHz}$\n-   $L = 3\\,\\text{cm}$\n\nThe total attenuation in decibels is:\n$$\nA_{\\text{dB}} = (0.3\\,\\text{dB}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}\\,\\text{MHz}^{-1}) \\times (2\\,\\text{MHz}) \\times (3\\,\\text{cm}) = 1.8\\,\\text{dB}\n$$\nThe problem requires this value to be expressed with four significant figures. Therefore, we write the total attenuation as $1.800\\,\\text{dB}$.\n\n**2. Amplitude Reduction Factor**\n\nThe decibel scale for an amplitude quantity, such as pressure ($P$), relates the initial pressure ($P_{\\text{initial}}$) to the final, attenuated pressure ($P_{\\text{final}}$) by the following formula:\n$$\nA_{\\text{dB}} = 20 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{P_{\\text{initial}}}{P_{\\text{final}}} \\right)\n$$\nIn our context, $P_{\\text{initial}}$ is the pressure measured in water, $P_r$, and $P_{\\text{final}}$ is the derated pressure in tissue, $P_{r.3}$. The amplitude reduction factor, let's call it $R$, is the ratio of the derated amplitude to the in-water amplitude:\n$$\nR = \\frac{P_{r.3}}{P_r}\n$$\nWe can rearrange the decibel formula to solve for this ratio. First, note that $\\frac{P_{r.3}}{P_r}$ is the reciprocal of $\\frac{P_r}{P_{r.3}}$:\n$$\nA_{\\text{dB}} = 20 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{1}{R} \\right) = -20 \\log_{10}(R)\n$$\nSolving for $R$:\n$$\n\\log_{10}(R) = -\\frac{A_{\\text{dB}}}{20}\n$$\n$$\nR = 10^{-\\frac{A_{\\text{dB}}}{20}}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated value of $A_{\\text{dB}} = 1.8$:\n$$\nR = 10^{-\\frac{1.8}{20}} = 10^{-0.09}\n$$\nCalculating this value:\n$$\nR \\approx 0.8128305...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the amplitude reduction factor is $0.8128$. This is a dimensionless quantity.\n\n**3. Derated Peak Rarefactional Pressure ($P_{r.3}$)**\n\nThe derated peak rarefactional pressure, $P_{r.3}$, is obtained by applying the amplitude reduction factor $R$ to the pressure measured in water, $P_r$.\n$$\nP_{r.3} = R \\times P_r\n$$\nUsing the unrounded value of $R$ for precision and the given value of $P_r = 1.2\\,\\text{MPa}$:\n$$\nP_{r.3} = (0.8128305...) \\times (1.2\\,\\text{MPa})\n$$\n$$\nP_{r.3} \\approx 0.9753966...\\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives:\n$$\nP_{r.3} = 0.9754\\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\nThis value, $P_{r.3}$, is the pressure used in the calculation of the Mechanical Index, which is defined as $\\text{MI} = \\frac{P_{r.3}}{\\sqrt{f}}$, where $P_{r.3}$ is in $\\text{MPa}$ and $f$ is in $\\text{MHz}$.\n\nThe three requested quantities, rounded to four significant figures, are:\n-   Total attenuation: $1.800\\,\\text{dB}$\n-   Amplitude reduction factor: $0.8128$\n-   Derated pressure $P_{r.3}$: $0.9754\\,\\text{MPa}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.800 & 0.8128 & 0.9754\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4899748"}, {"introduction": "The Mechanical Index ($MI$) provides a real-time estimate of the potential for cavitation, a key mechanical bioeffect.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem states that for a given soft-tissue model under steady exposure conditions, the temperature rise, which we denote as $\\Delta T$, is proportional to the applied acoustic power, $W$. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$\n\\Delta T = k \\cdot W\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality. This constant $k$ depends on the specific tissue properties and geometric factors of the exposure, such as perfusion, thermal conductivity, and the size of the heated region.\n\nThe problem defines $W_{1^\\circ\\mathrm{C}}$ as the specific acoustic power required to produce a temperature increase of exactly $1\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ under the same conditions.
