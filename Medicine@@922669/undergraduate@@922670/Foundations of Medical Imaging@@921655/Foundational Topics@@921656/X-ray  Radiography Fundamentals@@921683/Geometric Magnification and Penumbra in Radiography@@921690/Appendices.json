The key foundational principles are: (i) X-rays propagate in straight lines, and (ii) when two triangles share an apex at the source and are cut by two planes that are parallel to each other, the triangles are similar, so corresponding linear dimensions scale in proportion to their distances from the source.\n\nDefine the Source-to-Image Distance (SID) as the distance from the source to the detector plane, denoted by $SID$, and the Source-to-Object Distance (SOD) as the distance from the source to the object plane, denoted by $SOD$. Consider any small in-plane length element in the object plane with true length $L_{\\text{obj}}$. Its projection onto the detector has length $L_{\\text{img}}$. Because the object and detector planes are parallel and the central ray is perpendicular to both, the rays from the source through the endpoints of the length element form two similar triangles with the source as the common apex: one triangle spans from the source to the object plane, and the other from the source to the detector plane.\n\nBy similarity of triangles, the ratio of corresponding linear dimensions equals the ratio of the distances from the source to the respective planes.

We model the setup as follows: the X-ray source has a linear dimension $F$, the object is a straight edge at a distance $SOD$ from the source, and the detector is at a distance $OID$ from the object. X-rays are assumed to travel in straight lines.\n\nThe penumbra is the region on the detector that is partially illuminated. Its width $U$ is determined by the projection of the focal spot past the object edge onto the detector. Consider two limiting rays originating from the opposite ends of the focal spot, both just grazing the object edge. These intersecting rays form two triangles that share a common vertex at the object's edge.\n\n-   **Triangle 1:** The base is the focal spot itself (length $F$), and its height is the source-to-object distance, $SOD$.\n-   **Triangle 2:** The base is the penumbra on the detector (width $U$), and its height is the object-to-image distance, $OID$.\n\nBecause these triangles are formed by straight lines intersecting at a common vertex and their bases lie on parallel planes, they are **similar triangles**. The ratio of their bases must equal the ratio of their heights:\n$$\n\\frac{U}{F} = \\frac{OID}{SOD}\n$$\nSolving for the geometric unsharpness $U$, we obtain the derived expression:\n$$\nU = F \\cdot \\frac{OID}{SOD}\n$$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe evaluate the expression for $U$ with the given parameters: $F = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $SOD = 80\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, and $OID = 40\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.

This value represents the width of the blur at a sharp edge in the image and imposes a fundamental limit on the system's spatial resolution. Object features that project to the detector with a separation smaller than $U$ will have their blurred images (penumbras) substantially overlap, rendering them indistinguishable. Therefore, the minimum resolvable separation on the detector due to geometric effects is on the order of $U$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3}$$", "id": "4888258"}, {"introduction": "In modern digital radiography, the final image quality is a product of both analog physics and digital technology.
