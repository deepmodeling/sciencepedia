The photon is scattered through angle $\\theta$ with energy $E'$ and momentum $p' = E'/c$, and the electron recoils with some kinetic energy and momentum. We invoke conservation of relativistic energy and momentum.\n\nLet the initial four-momenta be\n- photon: $(E/c, \\mathbf{p})$ with $|\\mathbf{p}| = E/c$,\n- electron: $(m_e c, \\mathbf{0})$.\n\nAfter the collision:\n- scattered photon: $(E'/c, \\mathbf{p}')$ with $|\\mathbf{p}'| = E'/c$ and angle $\\theta$ relative to $\\mathbf{p}$,\n- recoiling electron: $(\\gamma m_e c, \\mathbf{p}_e)$, where $\\gamma = \\sqrt{1 + (p_e/(m_e c))^2}$, and $p_e = |\\mathbf{p}_e|$.\n\nConservation of energy and momentum gives\n$$\nE + m_e c^2 = E' + \\gamma m_e c^2,\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{p}' + \\mathbf{p}_e.\n$$\nWe eliminate the electron variables by squaring the momentum conservation equation and using the energy relation.

The primary at $60$ kiloelectronvolts and the scattered photon at approximately $53.70$ kiloelectronvolts differ by about $6.30$ kiloelectronvolts. If the detector’s energy resolution (for example, full width at half maximum) is comparable to or finer than this difference, windowing or thresholding can reduce acceptance of scattered photons. However, if the resolution is coarse relative to $6.30$ kiloelectronvolts, the two may overlap significantly, reducing the effectiveness of energy-based scatter rejection.\n- The Anti-Scatter Grid (ASG) primarily rejects photons based on propagation direction. A $90^\\circ$ scatter is grossly off-axis with respect to the incident beam and would be strongly rejected by an ASG due to the grid septa alignment. In clinical radiography, most detected scatter arises from small-angle scattering, where the energy shift is smaller and the direction remains closer to forward; such photons are more likely to pass through the ASG. Therefore, the energy shift at large angles aids spectral discrimination but those angles are typically already geometrically rejected, while small-angle scatter poses the predominant challenge for both spectral and geometric rejection methods.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{53.70}$$", "id": "4921725"}, {"introduction": "Anti-scatter grids are the workhorse of scatter reduction in radiography, but their use involves a critical trade-off between image quality and patient dose.

This corresponds to evaluating the signal profile along a line of constant $y$. Without loss of generality for frequency analysis, we can set $y=0$.

According to the Sampling Theorem, this operation is equivalent to multiplying the signal $I(x)$ by a Dirac comb in the spatial domain. In the frequency domain, this corresponds to convolving the spectrum of $I(x)$ with the Fourier transform of the Dirac comb, which is another Dirac comb with spacing $f_s$. This process creates replicas of the original signal's spectrum centered at every integer multiple of the sampling frequency, $k f_s$, where $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe original signal's spectrum has components at frequencies $\\pm f_p(\\theta)$ (and a DC component at $0$). The sampled signal's spectrum will therefore have components at frequencies $k f_s \\pm f_p(\\theta)$ for all integers $k$.\n\nA moiré artifact is an aliased signal, which arises when a spectral replica falls into the baseband of the reconstructed image. The baseband is conventionally defined as the frequency range from $0$ to the Nyquist frequency, $f_N = f_s/2$. The \"first-order alias\" corresponds to the spectral replicas for $k=\\pm 1$. The frequencies generated by these replicas are $\\pm f_s \\pm f_p(\\theta)$.\n\nThe frequency of the visible moiré artifact, $f_a$, is the frequency of the aliased component that appears in the baseband. This is the new spectral peak with the smallest non-zero frequency. We are looking for the minimum value of $|k f_s \\pm f_p(\\theta)|$ for $k \\ne 0$. This minimum occurs for $k=1$ or $k=-1$. The two potential new frequencies are $|f_s + f_p(\\theta)|=f_s + f_p(\\theta)$ and $|f_s - f_p(\\theta)|$. The smaller of these is $|f_s - f_p(\\theta)|$.\n\nThus, the observed moiré artifact frequency $f_a$ along the $x$-axis is:\n$$f_a = |f_s - f_p(\\theta)|$$\n\n### Part 3: Simplification for $\\theta = 90^\\circ$\n\nFor the case where the grid lines are perpendicular to the $x$-axis, the angle is $\\theta=90^\\circ$. We substitute this into the expression for the apparent frequency $f_p(\\theta)$:\n$$f_p(90^\\circ) = f_g |\\sin(90^\\circ)| = f_g \\cdot 1 = f_g$$\nIn this orientation, the sampling direction is directly across the grid lines, so the apparent frequency equals the intrinsic grid frequency.\nSubstituting this result into the expression for the moiré frequency $f_a$:\n$$f_a = |f_s - f_g|$$\n\n### Part 4: Numerical Calculation\n\nWe are given the following values:\n-   Grid line density $N_g = 70$ lines per centimeter.\n-   Detector pixel pitch $\\Delta = 0.140$ millimeters.\n-   Grid orientation $\\theta = 90^\\circ$.\n\nThe final result is requested in units of cycles per millimeter.
