Proceeding with the solution.\n\n***\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to find the largest total field width $2W$ at a Source-to-Image Distance (SID) of $D$, ensuring the beam is not clipped by either the exit port or the anode. This requires determining the maximum permissible symmetric half-angle $\\phi$ that satisfies all geometric constraints.\n\nLet us establish a 2D Cartesian coordinate system. We place the point source $F$ at the origin, $(0, 0)$. The central axis of the X-ray beam is aligned with the positive $x$-axis.\n\n1.  **Geometric Definitions:**\n    -   An X-ray ray emitted from the source $F$ at an angle $\\psi$ with the central axis is described by the line $y = x \\tan(\\psi)$.\n    -   The exit port is a slit on the vertical line $x=d$. Its edges are at the points $(d, a)$ and $(d, -a)$.\n    -   The anode surface passes through the origin $F$ and makes an angle $\\theta$ with the central axis. We can model the anode as a line in the upper half-plane, $y = x \\tan(\\theta)$ for $x > 0$. It is perfectly opaque, meaning no rays can be emitted into the region $y > x \\tan(\\theta)$.\n    -   The image plane is the line $x=D$. The lateral displacement on the image plane is $y = D \\tan(\\psi)$. The field half-width is $W = D \\tan(\\phi)$, where $\\phi$ is the limiting half-angle.\n\n2.  **Constraint Analysis:**\n    For a symmetric field of total width $2W$, rays must extend to angles of $+\\phi$ and $-\\phi$ relative to the central axis. We must find the maximum value of $\\phi$ such that a ray at any angle $\\psi$ where $|\\psi| \\le \\phi$ is not clipped. The constraints are most restrictive at the edges of the field, i.e., for $\\psi=+\\phi$ (anode side) and $\\psi=-\\phi$ (cathode side).\n\n    **a) Constraint from the Exit Port:**\n    A ray emitted at an angle $\\psi$ must pass through the aperture at $x=d$. At this location, the ray's vertical position is $y(d) = d \\tan(\\psi)$. For the ray to pass through the port, its vertical position must be within the half-aperture $a$.\n    $$|y(d)| \\le a$$\n    $$|d \\tan(\\psi)| \\le a$$\n    Since $d > 0$, we have $|\\tan(\\psi)| \\le \\frac{a}{d}$.\n    For a symmetric field defined by the half-angle $\\phi \\ge 0$, this condition must hold for all $|\\psi| \\le \\phi$. The most stringent case is at $|\\psi| = \\phi$, so we must have:\n    $$\\tan(\\phi) \\le \\frac{a}{d}$$\n    This defines the maximum half-angle allowed by the port, $\\phi_{\\text{port}}$, where $\\tan(\\phi_{\\text{port}}) = \\frac{a}{d}$, or $\\phi_{\\text{port}} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{a}{d}\\right)$. The constraint is thus $\\phi \\le \\phi_{\\text{port}}$.\n\n    **b) Constraint from the Anode Heel:**\n    The anode surface is modeled by the line $y = x \\tan(\\theta)$ in the upper half-plane ($y > 0$). This effect is asymmetric. It only constrains rays on the \"anode side,\" i.e., for emission angles $\\psi > 0$. For a ray at angle $\\psi > 0$ to be emitted (i.e., not be absorbed by the anode material itself), its path $y = x \\tan(\\psi)$ must lie below or on the anode surface $y = x \\tan(\\theta)$ for all $x > 0$.\n    $$x \\tan(\\psi) \\le x \\tan(\\theta)$$\n    For $x > 0$, this simplifies to:\n    $$\\tan(\\psi) \\le \\tan(\\theta)$$\n    Since the tangent function is monotonically increasing on the interval $(0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, and both $\\psi$ and $\\theta$ lie in this interval, this is equivalent to:\n    $$\\psi \\le \\theta$$\n    For a symmetric field of half-angle $\\phi$, the ray on the anode side is at $\\psi = \\phi$. Therefore, the anode heel constraint is $\\phi \\le \\theta$.\n\n3.  **Combining Constraints for the Usable Field:**\n    A symmetric field with half-angle $\\phi$ is unclipped if and only if it satisfies all constraints.\n    -   On the cathode side ($\\psi = -\\phi$), the only constraint is the port: $\\tan(-\\phi)| = \\tan(\\phi) \\le \\frac{a}{d}$.\n    -   On the anode side ($\\psi = \\phi$), the ray must clear both the port and the anode heel: $\\tan(\\phi) \\le \\frac{a}{d}$ AND $\\phi \\le \\theta$.\n    \n    The problem states the usable field is limited by the more restrictive constraint. Therefore, the maximum permissible half-angle, $\\phi_{\\text{max}}$, for the entire symmetric field is the minimum of all angular limits.\n    $$\\phi_{\\text{max}} = \\min\\left(\\arctan\\left(\\frac{a}{d}\\right), \\theta\\right)$$\n\n4.  **Derivation of the Field Width:**\n    The half-width of the beam on the image plane is given by $W = D \\tan(\\phi)$. The largest possible half-width, $W_{\\text{max}}$, is obtained using the maximum allowed half-angle, $\\phi_{\\text{max}}$.\n    $$W_{\\text{max}} = D \\tan(\\phi_{\\text{max}})$$\n    $$W_{\\text{max}} = D \\tan\\left(\\min\\left(\\arctan\\left(\\frac{a}{d}\\right), \\theta\\right)\\right)$$\n    Because $\\tan(x)$ is a strictly increasing function for angles in the first quadrant, we can exchange the order of the $\\tan$ and $\\min$ functions: $\\tan(\\min(A, B)) = \\min(\\tan(A), \\tan(B))$.\n    $$W_{\\text{max}} = D \\min\\left(\\tan\\left(\\arctan\\left(\\frac{a}{d}\\right)\\right), \\tan(\\theta)\\right)$$\n    Using the identity $\\tan(\\arctan(x)) = x$, we simplify the expression:\n    $$W_{\\text{max}} = D \\min\\left(\\frac{a}{d}, \\tan(\\theta)\\right)$$\n    The problem asks for the largest total field width, which is $2W_{\\text{max}}$.\n    $$2W_{\\text{max}} = 2D \\min\\left(\\frac{a}{d}, \\tan(\\theta)\\right)$$\n    This expression represents the largest symmetric field width at the image plane that is not geometrically clipped by either the exit port or the anode heel. It is determined by the SID, $D$, multiplied by twice the tangent of the most restrictive angle, which is the smaller of the angle subtended by the port aperture ($\\arctan(a/d)$) and the physical anode angle ($\\theta$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2 D \\min\\left(\\frac{a}{d}, \\tan(\\theta)\\right)}\n$$", "id": "4861827"}, {"introduction": "The primary consequence of the anode heel effect is a gradual variation in X-ray intensity across the detector, which can impact image quality and diagnostic accuracy.

The numerical values are physically realistic for a diagnostic X-ray tube. The problem is not trivial and requires a correct geometric derivation. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem requires us to derive an expression for the effective focal spot length, $L_{\\text{eff}}(y)$, and then use it to compute the symmetric difference $\\Delta$.\n\nFirst, we establish the geometry. We consider a 2D cross-section in the plane containing the central ray and the anode-cathode axis. Let the X-ray source (focal spot) be at the origin $(0,0)$. The central ray travels along the $z$-axis. The detector is a line at $z=D$. A point on the detector is specified by its coordinate $y$. The ray from the source to the point $(y,D)$ on the detector makes an angle $\\alpha(y)$ with the central ray. From trigonometry, we have:\n$$\n\\tan(\\alpha(y)) = \\frac{y}{D} \\implies \\alpha(y) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{D}\\right)\n$$\nBy convention, $y$ is positive on the cathode side and negative on the anode side, which makes $\\alpha(y)$ a signed angle.\n\nThe anode angle $\\theta$ is the angle between the anode surface and the plane perpendicular to the central ray (the $y$-axis in our coordinate system). The effective focal spot length $L_{\\text{eff}}(y)$ is the projection of the actual focal track length $L$ onto the plane perpendicular to the emergent ray. This is equivalent to $L$ multiplied by the sine of the angle between the focal track on the anode surface and the emergent ray. This angle is known as the \"takeoff angle\", $\\psi_{to}(y)$.\n$$\nL_{\\text{eff}}(y) = L \\sin(\\psi_{to}(y))\n$$\nThe takeoff angle $\\psi_{to}(y)$ is the angle between the anode surface and the emergent ray. From the geometric arrangement, the anode surface makes an angle $\\theta$ with the $y$-axis (the plane perpendicular to the central ray), and the emergent ray makes an angle $\\alpha(y)$ with the $z$-axis (the central ray). The angle between the anode surface and the emergent ray is the sum of these angles (considering the sign of $\\alpha(y)$).\n$$\n\\psi_{to}(y) = \\theta + \\alpha(y) = \\theta + \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{D}\\right)\n$$\nThis relationship correctly captures the physics: on the anode side ($y0$, $\\alpha(y)0$), the takeoff angle is smaller than $\\theta$, leading to a smaller effective focal spot. On the cathode side ($y0$, $\\alpha(y)0$), the takeoff angle is larger, resulting in a larger effective focal spot. For the central ray ($y=0$), $\\alpha(0)=0$ and $\\psi_{to}(0)=\\theta$, yielding $L_{\\text{eff}}(0) = L\\sin(\\theta)$, which is the standard formula for the line-focus principle.\n\nThus, the expression for the effective focal spot length is:\n$$\nL_{\\text{eff}}(y) = L \\sin\\left(\\theta + \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{D}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression at the specified points.\nGiven values: $\\theta = 7^{\\circ}$, $D = 100~\\text{cm} = 1000~\\text{mm}$, and $L = 2~\\text{mm}$.\nThe evaluation points are $y_c = +10~\\text{cm} = +100~\\text{mm}$ (cathode side) and $y_a = -10~\\text{cm} = -100~\\text{mm}$ (anode side).\n\nLet's define the off-axis angle magnitude $\\alpha_0$:\n$$\n\\alpha_0 = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{100~\\text{mm}}{1000~\\text{mm}}\\right) = \\arctan(0.1)\n$$\nAt the cathode side, $y = +100~\\text{mm}$, so the angle is $+\\alpha_0$. The effective focal spot length is:\n$$\nL_{\\text{eff}}(+100) = L \\sin(\\theta + \\alpha_0)\n$$\nAt the anode side, $y = -100~\\text{mm}$, so the angle is $-\\alpha_0$. The effective focal spot length is:\n$$\nL_{\\text{eff}}(-100) = L \\sin(\\theta - \\alpha_0)\n$$\nNow we compute the symmetric percent difference $\\Delta$:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\frac{2\\,|L_{\\text{eff}}(+100) - L_{\\text{eff}}(-100)|}{L_{\\text{eff}}(+100) + L_{\\text{eff}}(-100)} = \\frac{2\\,|L \\sin(\\theta + \\alpha_0) - L \\sin(\\theta - \\alpha_0)|}{L \\sin(\\theta + \\alpha_0) + L \\sin(\\theta - \\alpha_0)}\n$$\nThe factor $L$ cancels out:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\frac{2\\,|\\sin(\\theta + \\alpha_0) - \\sin(\\theta - \\alpha_0)|}{\\sin(\\theta + \\alpha_0) + \\sin(\\theta - \\alpha_0)}\n$$\nWe use the trigonometric sum-to-product identities:\n$\\sin(A) - \\sin(B) = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{A+B}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{A-B}{2}\\right)$\n$\\sin(A) + \\sin(B) = 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{A+B}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{A-B}{2}\\right)$\nLet $A = \\theta + \\alpha_0$ and $B = \\theta - \\alpha_0$. Then $\\frac{A+B}{2} = \\theta$ and $\\frac{A-B}{2} = \\alpha_0$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\Delta$:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\frac{2\\,|2 \\cos(\\theta) \\sin(\\alpha_0)|}{2 \\sin(\\theta) \\cos(\\alpha_0)} = \\frac{2 |\\cos(\\theta) \\sin(\\alpha_0)|}{\\sin(\\theta) \\cos(\\alpha_0)}\n$$\nGiven $\\theta = 7^\\circ$ and $\\alpha_0 = \\arctan(0.1) \\approx 5.71^\\circ$, both angles are in the first quadrant, so all trigonometric functions are positive. The absolute value can be removed.\n$$\n\\Delta = 2 \\frac{\\cos(\\theta)}{\\sin(\\theta)} \\frac{\\sin(\\alpha_0)}{\\cos(\\alpha_0)} = 2 \\cot(\\theta) \\tan(\\alpha_0)\n$$\nWe know that $\\tan(\\alpha_0) = \\tan(\\arctan(0.1)) = 0.1$.\nSubstituting the values for $\\theta$ and $\\tan(\\alpha_0)$:\n$$\n\\Delta = 2 \\cot(7^{\\circ}) \\times 0.1 = 0.2 \\cot(7^{\\circ}) = \\frac{0.2}{\\tan(7^{\\circ})}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value. It is critical to ensure the calculator is in degree mode for $\\tan(7^{\\circ})$.\n$$\n\\tan(7^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.12278456\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\approx \\frac{0.2}{0.12278456} \\approx 1.628860\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta \\approx 1.629\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.629}$$", "id": "4861838"}]}
