The problem is well-posed, objective, and does not contain any contradictions or fatal flaws. It is noted that the \"nominal tube power at the rated settings\" and the \"maximum instantaneous power\" are logically equivalent in this context, as the rated voltage is given as a peak value ($V_{\\max}$). This makes parts 1 and 3 of the question redundant, but it does not invalidate the problem. We will proceed with the derivation and calculations.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the instantaneous tube power, $P(t)$. Electrical power $P$ is defined as the rate at which work $W$ is done or energy is transferred, given by:\n$$P = \\frac{dW}{dt}$$\nThe electric potential difference $V$ between two points is the work done per unit charge $q$ in moving the charge between those points:\n$$V = \\frac{dW}{dq}$$\nThis can be rewritten as $dW = V dq$. Substituting this into the equation for power gives:\n$$P = \\frac{V dq}{dt}$$\nElectric current $I$ is defined as the rate of flow of charge:\n$$I = \\frac{dq}{dt}$$\nBy substituting the expression for current into the power equation, we obtain the general formula for instantaneous electrical power:\n$$P(t) = V(t) I(t)$$\nIn this specific problem, the tube current is held constant at a value $I$, while the tube voltage $V(t)$ varies with time. Therefore, the instantaneous tube power is given by:\n$$P(t) = V(t) I$$\n\nNext, we calculate the three requested power values.

The term 'kVp' explicitly denotes the peak voltage. Therefore, the nominal power corresponds to the power at these specified settings, which is the product of the constant current and the peak voltage.\n$$P_{\\text{nom}} = V_{\\max} I$$\n$$P_{\\text{nom}} = (100 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{V}) \\times (0.3\\,\\text{A}) = 30000\\,\\text{W} = 30\\,\\text{kW}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $P_{\\text{nom}} = 30.0\\,\\text{kW}$.\n\n2.  **Minimum instantaneous power ($P_{\\min}$):**\nThe instantaneous power $P(t) = V(t) I$ is minimized when the voltage $V(t)$ is at its minimum value, $V_{\\min}$. We can find $V_{\\min}$ using the given definition of the ripple fraction $r$:\n$$r = \\frac{V_{\\max} - V_{\\min}}{V_{\\max}}$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for $V_{\\min}$:\n$$r V_{\\max} = V_{\\max} - V_{\\min}$$\n$$V_{\\min} = V_{\\max} - r V_{\\max} = V_{\\max}(1 - r)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$V_{\\min} = (100 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{V}) \\times (1 - 0.13) = (100 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{V}) \\times 0.87 = 87 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{V}$$\nNow, we can calculate the minimum instantaneous power:\n$$P_{\\min} = V_{\\min} I$$\n$$P_{\\min} = (87 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{V}) \\times (0.3\\,\\text{A}) = 26100\\,\\text{W} = 26.1\\,\\text{kW}$$\nThis value is already given to three significant figures.\n\n3.  **Maximum instantaneous power ($P_{\\max}$):**\nThe instantaneous power $P(t) = V(t) I$ is maximized when the voltage $V(t)$ is at its maximum value, $V_{\\max}$.\n$$P_{\\max} = V_{\\max} I$$\nThis is the same calculation as for the nominal power.\n$$P_{\\max} = (100 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{V}) \\times (0.3\\,\\text{A}) = 30000\\,\\text{W} = 30\\,\\text{kW}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $P_{\\max} = 30.0\\,\\text{kW}$.\n\nThe three requested power values, in kilowatts and rounded to three significant figures, are:\n- Nominal power: $30.0\\,\\text{kW}$\n- Minimum instantaneous power: $26.1\\,\\text{kW}$\n- Maximum instantaneous power: $30.0\\,\\text{kW}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n30.0 & 26.1 & 30.0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4943386"}, {"introduction": "Having quantified the massive power input, the critical question becomes: how does an X-ray tube survive this intense thermal assault?

It asks for a derivation of the tangential speed $v$, a subsequent calculation of its value, and an explanation of its physical significance in the context of X-ray tube heat management. The problem is based on fundamental principles of kinematics and is directly relevant to the field of medical imaging physics. The parameters are physically realistic for a high-performance X-ray tube. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and unambiguous. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe primary task is to derive an expression for the tangential speed $v$ of a point at a radius $r$ on a rotating disk. The tangential speed is related to the angular velocity $\\omega$ and the radius $r$ by the fundamental kinematic equation for circular motion:\n$$v = \\omega r$$\nThe rotation rate is given in revolutions per minute ($\\text{rpm}$). Let us denote this quantity by $N$.

The electron beam generated by the cathode is accelerated and strikes a very small area on the anode, known as the focal spot. The kinetic energy of the electrons is converted primarily into heat upon impact. If the anode were stationary, this intense, localized heating would quickly raise the temperature of the focal spot above the melting point of the target material (typically tungsten), causing damage to the tube.\n\nBy rotating the anode, the stationary electron beam traces a circular path, the focal track, on the anode's surface. The tangential speed $v$ represents how quickly the anode material moves through the stationary electron beam. A high speed, such as the calculated $v \\approx 52.36\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, ensures that any given point on the focal track is exposed to the intense heat of the beam for only a very brief instant during each rotation. The total heat load from a clinical exposure is thus distributed over the much larger area of the entire focal track's circumference, rather than being concentrated on a single small spot. This rapid movement and spreading of the thermal load allows the anode to dissipate heat more effectively and tolerate much higher power inputs (i.e., higher X-ray tube currents and longer exposure times) without melting. This capability is critical for demanding imaging applications like computed tomography (CT) and angiography.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{52.36}\n$$", "id": "4943351"}, {"introduction": "An X-ray tube's design is ultimately a series of well-engineered compromises, balancing the need for high power with the goal of producing sharp diagnostic images.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe solution is developed in two parts as requested: computation of geometric unsharpness and analysis of exposure times.\n\n**Part 1: Geometric Unsharpness ($U_g$)**\n\nThe geometric unsharpness, or penumbra, on the image receptor is determined by the effective focal spot size and the imaging geometry. The derivation proceeds in three steps: calculating the effective focal spot size, determining the geometric magnification factor, and combining these to find the unsharpness.\n\nFirst, we apply the line-focus principle. The effective focal spot size, $f_{\\text{eff}}$, is the projection of the actual focal spot length, $\\ell$, as seen from the perspective of the central ray of the X-ray beam. This projection is given by:\n$$f_{\\text{eff}} = \\ell \\sin(\\theta)$$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the anode angle. We calculate the effective focal spot size for both the small and large settings.\nFor the small focal spot:\n$$f_{\\text{eff,small}} = \\ell_{\\text{small}} \\sin(\\theta) = (3.00 \\, \\mathrm{mm}) \\sin(12^{\\circ})$$\nFor the large focal spot:\n$$f_{\\text{eff,large}} = \\ell_{\\text{large}} \\sin(\\theta) = (6.00 \\, \\mathrm{mm}) \\sin(12^{\\circ})$$\n\nNext, we derive the formula for geometric unsharpness, $U_g$, using similar triangles. Let $f_{\\text{eff}}$ be the size of the source, $\\text{SOD}$ be the distance from the source to the object, and $\\text{OID}$ be the distance from the object to the image receptor. The geometry forms two similar triangles, with the object plane separating them. The ratio of the base to the height must be equal for both triangles. The base of the larger triangle is the unsharpness $U_g$ on the receptor, and its height is $\\text{OID}$. The base of the smaller triangle is the effective focal spot size $f_{\\text{eff}}$, and its height is $\\text{SOD}$.\n$$\\frac{U_g}{\\text{OID}} = \\frac{f_{\\text{eff}}}{\\text{SOD}}$$\nSolving for $U_g$, we get:\n$$U_g = f_{\\text{eff}} \\left( \\frac{\\text{OID}}{\\text{SOD}} \\right)$$\nThe distances are related by $\\text{SID} = \\text{SOD} + \\text{OID}$. Therefore, $\\text{OID} = \\text{SID} - \\text{SOD}$. Substituting this into the equation for $U_g$:\n$$U_g = f_{\\text{eff}} \\left( \\frac{\\text{SID} - \\text{SOD}}{\\text{SOD}} \\right) = f_{\\text{eff}} \\left( \\frac{\\text{SID}}{\\text{SOD}} - 1 \\right)$$\nThe term $\\frac{\\text{SID}}{\\text{SOD}}$ is the geometric magnification, $M$. Thus, the formula simplifies to:\n$$U_g = f_{\\text{eff}} (M - 1)$$\nUsing the given values, we calculate the magnification factor:\n$$M = \\frac{\\text{SID}}{\\text{SOD}} = \\frac{120 \\, \\mathrm{cm}}{80 \\, \\mathrm{cm}} = 1.5$$\nNow we can compute the geometric unsharpness for each focal spot.\nFor the small focal spot:\n$$U_{g,\\text{small}} = f_{\\text{eff,small}} (M - 1) = (3.00 \\, \\mathrm{mm}) \\sin(12^{\\circ}) (1.5 - 1)$$\n$$U_{g,\\text{small}} = (3.00 \\, \\mathrm{mm})(0.207912)(0.5) \\approx 0.311868 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $U_{g,\\text{small}} = 0.312 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nFor the large focal spot:\n$$U_{g,\\text{large}} = f_{\\text{eff,large}} (M - 1) = (6.00 \\, \\mathrm{mm}) \\sin(12^{\\circ}) (1.5 - 1)$$\n$$U_{g,\\text{large}} = (6.00 \\, \\mathrm{mm})(0.207912)(0.5) \\approx 0.623736 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $U_{g,\\text{large}} = 0.624 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\n**Part 2: Exposure Time and Implications**\n\nThe total exposure product, $Q$, is defined as the product of the tube current, $I$, and the exposure time, $t$:\n$$Q = I \\times t$$\nThe problem specifies that a total of $Q = 25 \\, \\mathrm{mAs}$ is required. To achieve the minimum possible exposure time, the system must be operated at the maximum allowable tube current, $I_{\\text{max}}$. Thus, the minimum time $t$ is given by:\n$$t = \\frac{Q}{I_{\\text{max}}}$$\nFor the small focal spot, the minimum exposure time is:\n$$t_{\\text{small}} = \\frac{Q}{I_{\\text{small,max}}} = \\frac{25 \\, \\mathrm{mAs}}{100 \\, \\mathrm{mA}} = 0.25 \\, \\mathrm{s}$$\nFor the large focal spot, the minimum exposure time is:\n$$t_{\\text{large}} = \\frac{Q}{I_{\\text{large,max}}} = \\frac{25 \\, \\mathrm{mAs}}{400 \\, \\mathrm{mA}} = 0.0625 \\, \\mathrm{s}$$\nThe ratio of the minimum exposure times is then calculated:\n$$\\frac{t_{\\text{small}}}{t_{\\text{large}}} = \\frac{Q/I_{\\text{small,max}}}{Q/I_{\\text{large,max}}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{large,max}}}{I_{\\text{small,max}}} = \\frac{400 \\, \\mathrm{mA}}{100 \\, \\mathrm{mA}} = 4$$\nAs a pure number rounded to three significant figures, this is $4.00$.\n\n**Implications of Focal Spot Selection:**\nThe choice between a small and a large focal spot represents a fundamental trade-off in radiography between spatial resolution and exposure time.\n-   **Small Focal Spot:** Produces a sharper image with less geometric unsharpness ($U_{g,\\text{small}} < U_{g,\\text{large}}$), which is critical for visualizing fine details. However, the electron beam's power density on the anode is higher, necessitating a lower tube current limit ($I_{\\text{small,max}}$) to prevent thermal damage to the anode. This results in a longer minimum exposure time ($t_{\\text{small}}$), which increases the potential for image blurring due to patient motion.\n-   **Large Focal Spot:** The thermal load is distributed over a larger area of the anode, allowing for a significantly higher tube current ($I_{\\text{large,max}}$). This enables much shorter exposure times ($t_{\\text{large}}$), which is advantageous for minimizing motion artifacts, particularly in pediatric, thoracic, or cardiac imaging. The cost is a loss of spatial resolution due to greater geometric unsharpness ($U_{g,\\text{large}} > U_{g,\\text{small}}$).\n-   **Dose Implications:** For a fixed radiographic technique (constant $kV_p$, filtration, and geometry) that requires a specific total exposure product ($mAs$), the total radiation dose delivered to the patient is the same regardless of the focal spot used. The dose *rate* is higher with the large focal spot due to the higher current, but the shorter exposure time exactly compensates, leading to the same total dose.\n\nThe final numerical results are $[U_{g,\\text{small}}, U_{g,\\text{large}}, t_{\\text{small}}/t_{\\text{large}}]$.\n$U_{g,\\text{small}} \\approx 0.312 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$\n$U_{g,\\text{large}} \\approx 0.624 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$\n$t_{\\text{small}}/t_{\\text{large}} = 4.00$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.312 & 0.624 & 4.00\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4943370"}]}
