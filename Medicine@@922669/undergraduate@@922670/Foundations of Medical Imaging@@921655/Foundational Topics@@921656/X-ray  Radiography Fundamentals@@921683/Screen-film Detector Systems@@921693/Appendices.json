A normalized Gaussian function centered at $x=0$ is described by the probability density function of a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $\\sigma^2$.

The argument is of the form $-ax^2 - bx$.\nLet's focus on the terms inside the exponent involving $x$:\n$$\n-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2} - i 2\\pi f x = -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\left[ x^2 + (2\\sigma^2)(i 2\\pi f) x \\right]\n$$\nTo complete the square for an expression $x^2 + 2cx$, we add and subtract $c^2$ to get $(x+c)^2 - c^2$.

The exponential of a real number is always real and positive. Therefore, the magnitude is simply the function itself.\n$$\nMTF_{\\text{screen}}(f) = \\exp(-2\\pi^2 f^2 \\sigma^2)\n$$\nThis result shows that the Fourier transform of a Gaussian function is another Gaussian function. A broad PSF (large $\\sigma$) in the spatial domain leads to a narrow MTF in the frequency domain, signifying poor resolution of high spatial frequencies.\n\n**Part 2: Justification of the Model**\n\nThe second part of the problem requires a physical justification for the Gaussian PSF and a derivation of the dependency of $\\sigma$ on the random walk parameters $N$ and $\\delta$.\n\n1.  **Justification of the Gaussian PSF via the Central Limit Theorem:**\n    An X-ray quantum absorbed in the scintillator screen generates a large number of lower-energy optical photons. These photons travel through the granular phosphor material to reach the film. Their paths are not straight; they undergo multiple scattering events. Each scattering event is assumed to be isotropic, redirecting the photon in a random direction.\n\n    Let's model the journey of a single optical photon as a random walk. The total lateral (sideways) displacement of the photon from its point of origin to its point of detection at the film is the sum of the lateral displacements from each of the $N$ scattering steps it undergoes. Let the lateral displacement in the $i$-th step be the random variable $x_i$. The total lateral displacement is $X = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i$.\n\n    The problem states that these scattering steps are independent. Since the scattering process is statistically similar at each step, we can also assume the random variables $x_i$ are identically distributed. The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** states that the sum of a sufficiently large number of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables, each with a well-defined mean and variance, will be approximately normally (i.e., Gaussian) distributed.\n\n    Given that the number of scattering events, $N$, is typically large within the screen, the CLT applies directly to the total lateral displacement $X$. The distribution of the final positions of a large ensemble of such photons will therefore be Gaussian. Since the PSF, $p(x)$, represents this spatial distribution of light intensity for a point input, it is justifiably modeled as a Gaussian function.\n\n2.  **Dependence of $\\sigma$ on $N$ and $\\delta$ via Variance Additivity:**\n    We need to relate the standard deviation $\\sigma$ of the overall PSF to the parameters of the random walk: $N$ (number of steps) and $\\delta$ (mean lateral step size).\n\n    The variance of a sum of **independent** random variables is the sum of their individual variances. Let the variance of the lateral displacement in a single step, $x_i$, be $Var(x_i) = \\sigma_{\\text{step}}^2$. Since the steps are identically distributed, this variance is the same for all $i=1, \\dots, N$. The variance of the total lateral displacement $X$ is:\n    $$\n    Var(X) = Var\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} Var(x_i) = N \\cdot \\sigma_{\\text{step}}^2\n    $$\n    The standard deviation of the final Gaussian PSF, $\\sigma$, is by definition the square root of the total variance $Var(X)$:\n    $$\n    \\sigma = \\sqrt{Var(X)} = \\sqrt{N \\cdot \\sigma_{\\text{step}}^2} = \\sigma_{\\text{step}} \\sqrt{N}\n    $$\n    The problem defines $\\delta$ as the \"mean lateral step size\". This term is typically interpreted as being proportional to the standard deviation of a single step, $\\sigma_{\\text{step}}$. For instance, if $\\delta$ is the root-mean-square lateral displacement per step, then $\\delta = \\sigma_{\\text{step}}$. Assuming this direct relationship, we have:\n    $$\n    \\sigma \\approx \\delta \\sqrt{N}\n    $$\n    More generally, $\\sigma$ is proportional to $\\delta \\sqrt{N}$. This argument shows that the variance of the blur, $\\sigma^2$, grows linearly with the number of scattering events and with the square of the characteristic lateral size of each scattering step. This confirms the physical intuition that more scattering or larger scattering angles lead to greater overall blur.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\exp(-2\\pi^2 f^2 \\sigma^2)}$$", "id": "4922286"}, {"introduction": "A complete evaluation of a detector's performance goes beyond signal and resolution alone; it must also account for noise and overall dose efficiency.

The NPS of the exposure is:\n$$ W_{E}(f) = W_{2}(f) T(f)^2 = \\frac{p \\bar{q}_{0} Y^2}{A} T(f)^2 $$\nThe average exposure is the operating point for the film, $E_0 = \\bar{q}_2 = Y p \\bar{q}_0$.\n\n**Stage 4: Film Density Encoding**\nFor small modulations, the film acts as a linear gain $g_F = \\gamma/(\\ln 10 \\, E_0)$ on exposure variations. The output quantity is optical density, $D$. The output NPS is the exposure NPS multiplied by the gain squared.\nThe output NPS is:\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{out}}(f) = g_F^2 W_{E}(f) = g_F^2 \\frac{p \\bar{q}_{0} Y^2}{A} T(f)^2 $$\nSubstituting $p=QDE$, we obtain the first required result:\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{out}}(f) = g_F^2 \\frac{QDE \\cdot \\bar{q}_{0} Y^2}{A} T(f)^2 $$\n\n**Derivation of NEQ($f$) and DQE($f$)**\nTo find the NEQ, we must first calculate the output signal-to-noise ratio squared, $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{out}}^{2}(f)$.\nThe signal is the modulation component of the mean. We track its amplitude through the cascade:\n1.  Input signal amplitude (quanta): $m \\bar{q}_{0}$.\n2.  After absorption: $p (m \\bar{q}_{0})$.\n3.  After optical gain: $Y p (m \\bar{q}_{0})$.\n4.  After blur: $Y p m \\bar{q}_{0} T(f)$. This is the amplitude of the exposure modulation, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{amp}}(f)$.\n5.  After film gain: The output signal is the modulation in density, with amplitude $S_{\\mathrm{out, amp}}(f) = g_F \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{amp}}(f) = g_F Y p m \\bar{q}_{0} T(f)$.\n\nThe output signal power is the square of the signal amplitude:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{out}}(f) = [S_{\\mathrm{out, amp}}(f)]^2 = (g_F Y p m \\bar{q}_{0} T(f))^2 $$\nThe output SNR squared is the ratio of the output signal power to the output NPS:\n$$ \\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{out}}^{2}(f) = \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{out}}(f)}{W_{\\mathrm{out}}(f)} = \\frac{(g_F Y p m \\bar{q}_{0} T(f))^2}{g_F^2 \\frac{p \\bar{q}_{0} Y^2}{A} T(f)^2} $$\nWe can simplify this expression by canceling common terms:\n$$ \\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{out}}^{2}(f) = \\frac{g_F^2 Y^2 p^2 m^2 \\bar{q}_{0}^2 T(f)^2}{g_F^2 Y^2 T(f)^2 \\frac{p \\bar{q}_{0}}{A}} = \\frac{p^2 m^2 \\bar{q}_{0}^2}{p \\bar{q}_{0}/A} = p m^2 \\bar{q}_{0} A $$\nThe problem defines the noise-equivalent quanta, $\\mathrm{NEQ}(f)$, by the relation $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{out}}^{2}(f) = m^{2}\\,\\mathrm{NEQ}(f)$.\n$$ p m^2 \\bar{q}_{0} A = m^2 \\mathrm{NEQ}(f) $$\nSolving for $\\mathrm{NEQ}(f)$ and substituting $p=QDE$:\n$$ \\mathrm{NEQ}(f) = p \\bar{q}_{0} A = QDE \\cdot A \\cdot \\bar{q}_{0} $$\nThe detective quantum efficiency, $\\mathrm{DQE}(f)$, is defined as $\\mathrm{DQE}(f) = \\mathrm{NEQ}(f)/\\bar{q}_{0}$.\n$$ \\mathrm{DQE}(f) = \\frac{QDE \\cdot A \\cdot \\bar{q}_{0}}{\\bar{q}_{0}} = QDE \\cdot A $$\nThe final expressions for $\\mathrm{NEQ}(f)$ and $\\mathrm{DQE}(f)$ are independent of frequency, gain $Y$, MTF $T(f)$, and film properties $g_F$, and depend only on the primary quantum detection efficiency $QDE$, the Swank factor $A$, and the incident quantum fluence $\\bar{q}_{0}$ as specified.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nQDE \\cdot A \\cdot \\bar{q}_{0} & QDE \\cdot A\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4922337"}]}
