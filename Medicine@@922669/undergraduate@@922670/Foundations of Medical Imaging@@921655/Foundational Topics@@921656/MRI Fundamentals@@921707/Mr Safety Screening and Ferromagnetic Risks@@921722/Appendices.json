A solution will be derived and calculated.\n\n**Derivation of the Force Expression**\nThe translational force $\\vec{F}$ on an object in a conservative field can be expressed as the negative gradient of its potential energy $U$. We are interested in the component along the $z$-axis:\n$$F_z = -\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z}$$\nThe potential energy $U$ of a magnetizable body introduced into an external magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is the negative of the work $W$ done to magnetize the body. For a linear magnetic material, this work is given by $W = \\frac{1}{2} \\int \\vec{M} \\cdot \\vec{B} \\,d\\mathcal{V}$, where $\\vec{M}$ is the magnetization (magnetic dipole moment per unit volume) and the integral is over the volume of the body.\nThus, the potential energy is:\n$$U = -W = -\\frac{1}{2} \\int_V \\vec{M} \\cdot \\vec{B} \\,d\\mathcal{V}$$\nThe factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ distinguishes this from the potential energy of a permanent dipole, arising because the magnetization $\\vec{M}$ is induced by and is a function of the field $\\vec{B}$ itself.\n\nFor a linear, isotropic material, the magnetization is related to the magnetic field strength $\\vec{H}$ by $\\vec{M} = \\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\vec{H}$, where $\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the magnetic susceptibility. The magnetic fields $\\vec{B}$ and $\\vec{H}$ are related by $\\vec{B} = \\mu_0(\\vec{H} + \\vec{M})$. The problem states that demagnetization effects can be neglected. This implies that the internal magnetic field strength $\\vec{H}$ within the body is approximately equal to the external field strength $\\vec{H}_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ that would exist in the absence of the body. The external field $\\vec{B}$ is related to $\\vec{H}_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ by $\\vec{B} = \\mu_0 \\vec{H}_{\\mathrm{ext}}$. Therefore, we can approximate $\\vec{H} \\approx \\vec{B}/\\mu_0$.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for magnetization:\n$$\\vec{M} = \\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\vec{H} \\approx \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\mu_0} \\vec{B}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\vec{M}$ into the potential energy formula:\n$$U = -\\frac{1}{2} \\int_V \\left(\\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{\\mu_0} \\vec{B}\\right) \\cdot \\vec{B} \\,d\\mathcal{V} = -\\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{2\\mu_0} \\int_V B^2 \\,d\\mathcal{V}$$\nThe problem assumes the body is sufficiently small that the field can be considered uniform over its volume $V$. This allows us to treat $B^2$ as a constant with respect to the integration, yielding:\n$$U \\approx -\\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}} V}{2\\mu_0} B^2$$\nNow, we can find the force component $F_z$ by taking the negative partial derivative of $U$ with respect to $z$. The terms $\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, $V$, and $\\mu_0$ are constants.\n$$F_z = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left( -\\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}} V}{2\\mu_0} B^2 \\right)$$\n$$F_z = \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}} V}{2\\mu_0} \\frac{\\partial(B^2)}{\\partial z}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the translational force component $F_z$ in terms of the specified parameters.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\nNext, we evaluate $F_z$ using the given numerical values.

The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe force $\\mathbf{F}$ on a magnetic dipole with moment $\\mathbf{m}$ in a magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ is given by $\\mathbf{F} = \\nabla(\\mathbf{m} \\cdot \\mathbf{B})$. For a small particle where magnetization $\\mathbf{M}$ is uniform and aligned with the external field, and the field has a gradient only along the $z$-axis, this simplifies to a force along the $z$-axis:\n$$ F_z = m_z \\frac{\\mathrm{d}B_z}{\\mathrm{d}z} $$\nwhere $m_z$ is the $z$-component of the total magnetic moment of the particle. The magnetic moment is the product of the magnetization $M_z$ and the particle's volume $V$:\n$$ m_z = M_z V $$\nThe core of the problem is to determine the magnetization $M$ for each particle shape.

The dot product simplifies to:\n$$U(x) = -m B(x)$$\nThe work done by the conservative magnetic force is equal to the negative change in potential energy:\n$$W_{\\text{mag}} = -\\Delta U = -(U(x_{f}) - U(x_{i}))$$\nSubstituting the expression for $U(x)$:\n$$W_{\\text{mag}} = -(-m B(x_{f}) - (-m B(x_{i}))) = m(B(x_{f}) - B(x_{i}))$$\nTherefore, the final kinetic energy is:\n$$K = m(B(x_{f}) - B(x_{i}))$$\nAs a check, we can derive this from the force.

The volume $V$ of the object is its mass $m_{\\mathrm{obj}}$ divided by its density $\\rho$:\n$$V = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{obj}}}{\\rho}$$\nSo, the magnetic moment is:\n$$m = M_{s} \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{obj}}}{\\rho}$$\nNext, we evaluate the magnetic field at the initial and final positions using the given profile $B(x) = B_{0}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L}\\right)\\right)$.\nAt the initial position $x_{i} = 0\\,\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$B(x_{i}) = B(0) = B_{0}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0}{L}\\right)\\right) = B_{0}(1 - \\exp(0)) = B_{0}(1-1) = 0\\,\\mathrm{T}$$\nAt the final position $x_{f} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$B(x_{f}) = B_{0}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_{f}}{L}\\right)\\right)$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for kinetic energy:\n$$K = \\left(M_{s} \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{obj}}}{\\rho}\\right) \\left( B_{0}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_{f}}{L}\\right)\\right) - 0 \\right)$$\n$$K = M_{s} \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{obj}}}{\\rho} B_{0} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_{f}}{L}\\right)\\right)$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n$m_{\\mathrm{obj}} = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n$\\rho = 7.8 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}$\n$M_{s} = 1.6 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{A/m}$\n$B_{0} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{T}$\n$L = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$x_{f} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the magnetic moment $m$:\n$$m = (1.6 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{A/m}) \\frac{0.50\\,\\mathrm{kg}}{7.8 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}} \\approx 1.02564 \\times 10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{A \\cdot m^2}$$\nNext, the ratio in the exponential:\n$$\\frac{x_{f}}{L} = \\frac{2.0\\,\\mathrm{m}}{0.50\\,\\mathrm{m}} = 4.0$$\nNow, we calculate the final kinetic energy $K$:\n$$K = (1.02564 \\times 10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{A \\cdot m^2}) \\times (1.5\\,\\mathrm{T}) \\times (1 - \\exp(-4.0))$$\n$$K \\approx (1.02564 \\times 10^{2}) \\times (1.5) \\times (1 - 0.0183156)\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\n$$K \\approx (1.02564 \\times 10^{2}) \\times (1.5) \\times (0.9816844)\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\n$$K \\approx 151.031\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get:\n$$K \\approx 151\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\n\n**Interpretation of the Result**\nA kinetic energy of $151\\,\\mathrm{J}$ for a $0.50\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ object (approximately $1.1\\,\\mathrm{lbs}$) constitutes a lethal projectile risk. To contextualize this energy, we can calculate the object's final velocity, $v_f$:\n$$K = \\frac{1}{2} m_{\\mathrm{obj}} v_f^2 \\implies v_f = \\sqrt{\\frac{2K}{m_{\\mathrm{obj}}}}$$\n$$v_f = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 151\\,\\mathrm{J}}{0.50\\,\\mathrm{kg}}} = \\sqrt{604}\\,\\mathrm{m/s} \\approx 24.6\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$\nThis velocity corresponds to approximately $88.5\\,\\mathrm{km/h}$ or $55\\,\\mathrm{mph}$. An object of this mass traveling at this speed can cause catastrophic impact damage, equivalent to or exceeding the impact energy of many hand tools swung with maximal force. If such a projectile were to strike a person (e.g., a patient inside the MRI bore or a healthcare worker), it would almost certainly result in severe trauma or death. This calculation, although based on a simplified model, quantitatively demonstrates the immense danger posed by the magnetic forces in an MRI environment on seemingly small ferromagnetic objects. It underscores the absolute necessity for rigorous and comprehensive MR safety screening procedures to prevent any such objects from entering the high-field area. The \"missile effect\" is one of the most severe and well-documented physical hazards associated with MRI technology.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{151}$$", "id": "4902370"}]}
