We model the loop as a thin circular wire of radius $a$ lying in the $x$–$y$ plane, centered at the origin, and carrying a steady current $I$. We want to find the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ at a point $P$ on the $z$-axis, with coordinates $(0, 0, z)$.\n\nThe Biot-Savart law gives the differential magnetic field $d\\vec{B}$ produced by a current element $I \\, d\\vec{l}$:\n$$d\\vec{B} = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{4\\pi} \\frac{d\\vec{l} \\times \\vec{r}}{r^3}$$\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, $d\\vec{l}$ is a differential length vector element of the wire, and $\\vec{r}$ is the vector from the element $d\\vec{l}$ to the point $P$.\n\nLet's define the vectors in a cylindrical coordinate system.

The vector $\\vec{r}$ from the source element $d\\vec{l}$ at $\\vec{l}'$ to the field point $\\vec{P}$ is:\n$$\\vec{r} = \\vec{P} - \\vec{l}' = -a\\cos\\phi\\,\\hat{x} - a\\sin\\phi\\,\\hat{y} + z\\,\\hat{z}$$\nThe magnitude of $\\vec{r}$ is:\n$$r = |\\vec{r}| = \\sqrt{(-a\\cos\\phi)^2 + (-a\\sin\\phi)^2 + z^2} = \\sqrt{a^2(\\cos^2\\phi + \\sin^2\\phi) + z^2} = \\sqrt{a^2 + z^2}$$\nThe magnitude $r$ is constant for all elements along the loop.\n\nNext, we calculate the cross product $d\\vec{l} \\times \\vec{r}$:\n$$d\\vec{l} \\times \\vec{r} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\hat{x} & \\hat{y} & \\hat{z} \\\\ -a\\sin\\phi \\, d\\phi & a\\cos\\phi \\, d\\phi & 0 \\\\ -a\\cos\\phi & -a\\sin\\phi & z \\end{vmatrix}$$\n$$d\\vec{l} \\times \\vec{r} = ( (a\\cos\\phi \\, d\\phi)(z) - (0)(-a\\sin\\phi) ) \\hat{x} - ( (-a\\sin\\phi \\, d\\phi)(z) - (0)(-a\\cos\\phi) ) \\hat{y} + ( (-a\\sin\\phi \\, d\\phi)(-a\\sin\\phi) - (a\\cos\\phi \\, d\\phi)(-a\\cos\\phi) ) \\hat{z}$$\n$$d\\vec{l} \\times \\vec{r} = (a z \\cos\\phi \\, d\\phi) \\hat{x} + (a z \\sin\\phi \\, d\\phi) \\hat{y} + (a^2 (\\sin^2\\phi + \\cos^2\\phi) \\, d\\phi) \\hat{z}$$\n$$d\\vec{l} \\times \\vec{r} = (az\\cos\\phi\\,\\hat{x} + az\\sin\\phi\\,\\hat{y} + a^2\\,\\hat{z}) \\, d\\phi$$\nTo find the total magnetic field $\\vec{B}$, we integrate $d\\vec{B}$ over the entire loop (from $\\phi=0$ to $\\phi=2\\pi$):\n$$\\vec{B}(z) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{4\\pi} \\frac{(az\\cos\\phi\\,\\hat{x} + az\\sin\\phi\\,\\hat{y} + a^2\\,\\hat{z}) \\, d\\phi}{(a^2+z^2)^{3/2}}$$\nDue to symmetry, the transverse components (in the $\\hat{x}$ and $\\hat{y}$ directions) integrate to zero:\n$$\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\cos\\phi \\, d\\phi = [\\sin\\phi]_0^{2\\pi} = 0$$\n$$\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin\\phi \\, d\\phi = [-\\cos\\phi]_0^{2\\pi} = 0$$\nOnly the longitudinal component (in the $\\hat{z}$ direction) remains:\n$$\\vec{B}(z) = \\frac{\\mu_0 I a^2 \\hat{z}}{4\\pi(a^2+z^2)^{3/2}} \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi = \\frac{\\mu_0 I a^2 \\hat{z}}{4\\pi(a^2+z^2)^{3/2}} [2\\pi]$$\n$$\\vec{B}(z) = \\frac{\\mu_0 I a^2}{2(a^2+z^2)^{3/2}} \\hat{z}$$\nThe problem asks for the magnetic field magnitude $B(z)$, which is the magnitude of this vector:\n$$B(z) = \\frac{\\mu_0 I a^2}{2(a^2+z^2)^{3/2}}$$\nThe problem states that sensitivity is proportional to the magnetic field per unit current. Let us define $B'(z) = B(z)/I$.\n\nNow, we form the normalized sensitivity falloff $s(z) = B(z)/B(0)$. First, we find the field at the center of the loop, $z=0$:\n$$B(0) = \\frac{\\mu_0 I a^2}{2(a^2+0^2)^{3/2}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 I a^2}{2a^3} = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2a}$$\nThe normalized sensitivity $s(z)$ is the ratio:\n$$s(z) = \\frac{B(z)}{B(0)} = \\frac{\\frac{\\mu_0 I a^2}{2(a^2+z^2)^{3/2}}}{\\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2a}} = \\frac{a^3}{(a^2+z^2)^{3/2}}$$\nThis can also be written as:\n$$s(z) = \\left( \\frac{a^2}{a^2+z^2} \\right)^{3/2} = \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + (z/a)^2} \\right)^{3/2}$$\nThis expression for $s(z)$ describes the trade-off between element radius $a$ and depth sensitivity. The sensitivity at a depth $z$ is a function of the ratio $z/a$. To maintain a certain level of normalized sensitivity $s(z)$ at a greater depth $z$, the radius of the loop $a$ must be increased proportionally. Therefore, larger radius coils ($a$ is large) have better penetration, meaning their sensitivity falls off more slowly with depth. Conversely, smaller radius coils ($a$ is small) have a sensitivity that is more concentrated near the surface and falls off rapidly with depth, providing high sensitivity for superficial structures but poor sensitivity for deep structures. This is a fundamental trade-off in RF coil design.\n\nFinally, we need to find the depth $z_{1/2}$ at which the normalized sensitivity $s(z)$ falls to $1/2$ for a loop of radius $a = 7.0$ cm. We set $s(z_{1/2}) = 1/2$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{a^3}{(a^2+z_{1/2}^2)^{3/2}}$$\nTo solve for $z_{1/2}$, we can take both sides to the power of $(-2/3)$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{-2/3} = \\left(\\frac{a^3}{(a^2+z_{1/2}^2)^{3/2}}\\right)^{-2/3}$$\n$$2^{2/3} = \\frac{(a^2+z_{1/2}^2)^{(3/2) \\cdot (2/3)}}{(a^3)^{(2/3)}} = \\frac{a^2+z_{1/2}^2}{a^2}$$\n$$2^{2/3} = 1 + \\frac{z_{1/2}^2}{a^2}$$\nRearranging to solve for $z_{1/2}$:\n$$\\frac{z_{1/2}^2}{a^2} = 2^{2/3} - 1$$\n$$z_{1/2} = a \\sqrt{2^{2/3} - 1}$$\nNow, we substitute the given value $a = 7.0$ cm:\n$$z_{1/2} = (7.0) \\sqrt{2^{2/3} - 1} \\text{ cm}$$\nWe calculate the numerical value:\n$$2^{2/3} \\approx 1.587401$$\n$$2^{2/3} - 1 \\approx 0.587401$$\n$$\\sqrt{0.587401} \\approx 0.766421$$\n$$z_{1/2} \\approx 7.0 \\times 0.766421 \\text{ cm} \\approx 5.364947 \\text{ cm}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $z_{1/2} = 5.36$ cm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.36}$$", "id": "4916278"}, {"introduction": "After designing a coil's geometry, its real-world performance must be characterized, especially when interacting with a subject.

Thus, we equate the real and imaginary parts of $Y_{in}$ to $1/R_S$ and $0$ respectively.\n\nEquating the real parts (conductance):\n$$\\frac{1}{R_S} = \\frac{R_L}{R_L^2 + X_s^2}$$\n$$R_L^2 + X_s^2 = R_S R_L$$\n$$X_s^2 = R_S R_L - R_L^2 = R_L (R_S - R_L)$$\nThis yields the magnitude of the series reactance:\n$$|X_s| = \\sqrt{R_L (R_S - R_L)}$$\n\nEquating the imaginary parts (susceptance) to zero:\n$$-\\frac{1}{X_p} - \\frac{X_s}{R_L^2 + X_s^2} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{1}{X_p} = -\\frac{X_s}{R_L^2 + X_s^2}$$\nSubstituting $R_L^2 + X_s^2 = R_S R_L$ from the real part equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{X_p} = -\\frac{X_s}{R_S R_L}$$\nThis gives the shunt reactance in terms of the series reactance:\n$$X_p = -\\frac{R_S R_L}{X_s}$$\nAs required for a two-element lossless network, $X_s$ and $X_p$ must have opposite signs.\n\nNow, we substitute the given values: $R_L = 6.0\\,\\Omega$, $R_S = 50\\,\\Omega$.\n$$|X_s| = \\sqrt{6.0\\,\\Omega \\times (50\\,\\Omega - 6.0\\,\\Omega)} = \\sqrt{6.0 \\times 44}\\,\\Omega = \\sqrt{264}\\,\\Omega$$\nThe two possible signs for $X_s$ correspond to the two canonical L-network topologies.\n\n**Case 1: Low-Pass Topology (Series Inductor, Shunt Capacitor)**\nIn this case, the series element is an inductor and the shunt element is a capacitor.\nThe series reactance is positive: $X_s = \\omega_0 L > 0$.\nThe shunt reactance is negative: $X_p = -1/(\\omega_0 C) < 0$.\nWe choose the positive root for $X_s$:\n$$X_s = +\\sqrt{264}\\,\\Omega$$\nThe corresponding shunt reactance is:\n$$X_p = -\\frac{R_S R_L}{X_s} = -\\frac{50\\,\\Omega \\times 6.0\\,\\Omega}{\\sqrt{264}\\,\\Omega} = -\\frac{300}{\\sqrt{264}}\\,\\Omega$$\nThe angular frequency is $\\omega_0 = 2\\pi f_0 = 2\\pi(128 \\times 10^6)\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\nThe inductance $L_{\\text{low}}$ is found from $X_s = \\omega_0 L_{\\text{low}}$:\n$$L_{\\text{low}} = \\frac{X_s}{\\omega_0} = \\frac{\\sqrt{264}}{2\\pi \\times 128 \\times 10^6} \\approx 2.0202 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{H} = 20.202\\,\\text{nH}$$\nThe capacitance $C_{\\text{low}}$ is found from $X_p = -1/(\\omega_0 C_{\\text{low}})$:\n$$C_{\\text{low}} = -\\frac{1}{\\omega_0 X_p} = -\\frac{1}{(2\\pi \\times 128 \\times 10^6) \\times (-300/\\sqrt{264})} = \\frac{\\sqrt{264}}{2\\pi \\times 128 \\times 10^6 \\times 300} \\approx 6.7341 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{F} = 67.341\\,\\text{pF}$$\nRounding to three significant figures: $L_{\\text{low}} = 20.2\\,\\text{nH}$ and $C_{\\text{low}} = 67.3\\,\\text{pF}$.\n\n**Case 2: High-Pass Topology (Series Capacitor, Shunt Inductor)**\nIn this case, the series element is a capacitor and the shunt element is an inductor.\nThe series reactance is negative: $X_s = -1/(\\omega_0 C) < 0$.\nThe shunt reactance is positive: $X_p = \\omega_0 L > 0$.\nWe choose the negative root for $X_s$:\n$$X_s = -\\sqrt{264}\\,\\Omega$$\nThe corresponding shunt reactance is:\n$$X_p = -\\frac{R_S R_L}{X_s} = -\\frac{50\\,\\Omega \\times 6.0\\,\\Omega}{-\\sqrt{264}\\,\\Omega} = \\frac{300}{\\sqrt{264}}\\,\\Omega$$\nThe capacitance $C_{\\text{high}}$ is found from $X_s = -1/(\\omega_0 C_{\\text{high}})$:\n$$C_{\\text{high}} = -\\frac{1}{\\omega_0 X_s} = -\\frac{1}{(2\\pi \\times 128 \\times 10^6) \\times (-\\sqrt{264})} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\times 128 \\times 10^6 \\times \\sqrt{264}} \\approx 7.6528 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{F} = 76.528\\,\\text{pF}$$\nThe inductance $L_{\\text{high}}$ is found from $X_p = \\omega_0 L_{\\text{high}}$:\n$$L_{\\text{high}} = \\frac{X_p}{\\omega_0} = \\frac{300/\\sqrt{264}}{2\\pi \\times 128 \\times 10^6} \\approx 2.2954 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{H} = 22.954\\,\\text{nH}$$\nRounding to three significant figures: $C_{\\text{high}} = 76.5\\,\\text{pF}$ and $L_{\\text{high}} = 23.0\\,\\text{nH}$.\n\nThe final component values, rounded to three significant figures and in the specified units and order, are:\n- $L_{\\text{low}} = 20.2\\,\\text{nH}$\n- $C_{\\text{low}} = 67.3\\,\\text{pF}$\n- $C_{\\text{high}} = 76.5\\,\\text{pF}$\n- $L_{\\text{high}} = 23.0\\,\\text{nH}$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 20.2 & 67.3 & 76.5 & 23.0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4916258"}]}
