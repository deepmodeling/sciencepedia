According to the problem statement, the nuclear magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ is proportional to the nuclear angular momentum $\\vec{J}$. This relationship is defined by the gyromagnetic ratio, $\\gamma$:\n    $$ \\vec{\\mu} = \\gamma \\vec{J} $$\n\n2.

Substituting the expression for $\\vec{\\mu}$ from step 1 into this equation of motion, we get:\n    $$ \\frac{d\\vec{J}}{dt} = (\\gamma \\vec{J}) \\times \\vec{B} $$\n    Since $\\gamma$ is a scalar, it can be factored out:\n    $$ \\frac{d\\vec{J}}{dt} = \\gamma (\\vec{J} \\times \\vec{B}) $$\n\n6.  Let us define the coordinate system such that the static magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is directed along the $z$-axis. Thus, $\\vec{B} = B_0 \\hat{k}$, where $B_0$ is the magnitude of the field. The equation of motion becomes:\n    $$ \\frac{d\\vec{J}}{dt} = \\gamma (\\vec{J} \\times (B_0 \\hat{k})) $$\n\n7.  This equation describes the time evolution of the angular momentum vector $\\vec{J}$.

We simplify it by transforming to a reference frame rotating about the $\\hat{z}$-axis with an angular velocity $\\vec{\\omega}_{\\text{rot}}$. The rate of change of magnetization in the lab frame $(\\frac{d\\vec{M}}{dt})_{\\text{lab}}$ and the rotating frame $(\\frac{d\\vec{M}}{dt})_{\\text{rot}}$ are related by:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d\\vec{M}}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{lab}} = \\left(\\frac{d\\vec{M}}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{rot}} + \\vec{\\omega}_{\\text{rot}} \\times \\vec{M}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Bloch equation:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d\\vec{M}}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{rot}} + \\vec{\\omega}_{\\text{rot}} \\times \\vec{M} = \\gamma (\\vec{M} \\times \\vec{B})\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d\\vec{M}}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{rot}} = \\gamma (\\vec{M} \\times \\vec{B}) - \\vec{\\omega}_{\\text{rot}} \\times \\vec{M} = \\gamma \\left(\\vec{M} \\times \\vec{B} + \\vec{M} \\times \\frac{\\vec{\\omega}_{\\text{rot}}}{\\gamma}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d\\vec{M}}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{rot}} = \\gamma \\left(\\vec{M} \\times \\left[\\vec{B} + \\frac{\\vec{\\omega}_{\\text{rot}}}{\\gamma}\\right]\\right) = \\gamma (\\vec{M} \\times \\vec{B}_{\\text{eff}})\n$$\nwhere $\\vec{B}_{\\text{eff}} = \\vec{B} + \\frac{\\vec{\\omega}_{\\text{rot}}}{\\gamma}$ is the effective magnetic field in the rotating frame.\n\nThe problem states the RF pulse is \"on-resonance,\" which means its frequency is the Larmor frequency, $\\omega_0 = \\gamma B_0$.

One component is static in the rotating frame, while the other rotates at $2\\omega_0$ and its effect averages to zero (the rotating wave approximation). In the context of MRI, it is standard convention to define $B_1$ as the amplitude of the single effective, co-rotating circularly polarized component. We will adhere to this convention. Therefore, in the rotating frame, the RF field is a static field of magnitude $B_1$ along an axis in the transverse plane, which we label $\\hat{x}'$.\n$$\n\\vec{B}_{\\text{eff}} = B_1 \\hat{x}'\n$$\nThe equation of motion in the rotating frame simplifies to:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d\\vec{M}}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{rot}} = \\gamma (\\vec{M} \\times B_1 \\hat{x}')\n$$\nInitially, the magnetization is at thermal equilibrium, aligned with the static field: $\\vec{M}(0) = M_0 \\hat{z}'$.
