The derivation will be based on the fundamental definitions of signal sampling.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the parameters provided. The dwell time, $T_{\\mathrm{dw}}$, is the time interval between the acquisition of consecutive samples in the time domain. The sampling frequency, $f_s$, is therefore the reciprocal of the dwell time:\n$$f_s = \\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{dw}}}$$\nThe problem states that the spectral bandwidth, $BW$, of the acquisition is set by the sampling frequency. In digital signal processing for MRI, to avoid aliasing in the frequency-encoded direction according to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, the sampling frequency is set to equal the spectral bandwidth. The spectral bandwidth defines the full range of frequencies to be digitized. Thus, we have:\n$$f_s = BW$$\nBy combining these two fundamental equations, we establish a direct relationship between the dwell time and the spectral bandwidth:\n$$BW = \\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{dw}}}$$\nThis implies that $T_{\\mathrm{dw}}$ and $BW$ are not independent variables but are reciprocals of each other.\n\nNext, we define the total readout time, $T_{\\mathrm{ro}}$. This is the total duration of the signal acquisition window, also known as the ADC gate time. During this time, a total of $N_x$ samples are acquired. Since the sampling is uniform with an interval of $T_{\\mathrm{dw}}$, the total readout time is the product of the number of samples and the duration per sample:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{ro}} = N_x T_{\\mathrm{dw}}$$\nThe problem asks for an expression for $T_{\\mathrm{ro}}$ in terms of $N_x$, $T_{\\mathrm{dw}}$, and $BW$. The set of relationships derived above fully describes the connection between these parameters. Specifically, we have two primary expressions for $T_{\\mathrm{ro}}$:\n1.  In terms of $N_x$ and $T_{\\mathrm{dw}}$: $T_{\\mathrm{ro}} = N_x T_{\\mathrm{dw}}$\n2.  In terms of $N_x$ and $BW$: By substituting $T_{\\mathrm{dw}} = 1/BW$ into the first expression, we get:\n    $$T_{\\mathrm{ro}} = N_x \\left(\\frac{1}{BW}\\right) = \\frac{N_x}{BW}$$\nThese two expressions collectively represent the derived relationship between $T_{\\mathrm{ro}}$, $N_x$, $T_{\\mathrm{dw}}$, and $BW$. For the numerical evaluation part of the problem, the second expression is the operative one, as values for $N_x$ and $BW$ are provided.\n\nWe are asked to evaluate $T_{\\mathrm{ro}}$ for the following values:\n- Number of samples, $N_x = 1536$\n- Spectral bandwidth, $BW = 192 \\times 10^{3} \\, \\mathrm{Hz}$\n\nThe unit of bandwidth, Hertz ($\\mathrm{Hz}$), is equivalent to inverse seconds ($\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). Substituting the given values into the derived formula:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{ro}} = \\frac{1536}{192 \\times 10^{3} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}$$\nWe first evaluate the ratio of the numbers:\n$$\\frac{1536}{192} = 8$$\nTherefore, the total readout time in seconds is:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{ro}} = 8 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{s}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in milliseconds ($\\mathrm{ms}$).

This exercise challenges you to think like a sequence designer and predict the consequences of an advanced, variable-density sampling strategy. By analyzing how aggressively undersampling high-frequency data affects edge sharpness and aliasing, you will uncover the foundational trade-offs that govern accelerated imaging techniques.", "problem": "A research team is acquiring a Cartesian Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) dataset of a stationary object whose spin density has a single sharp step edge along one spatial direction.

They reconstruct with a standard inverse discrete Fourier transform assuming missing samples are zero-filled and apply no additional filtering.\n\nTo reduce scan time, they use a variable-density sampling pattern that fully samples the central k-space region for $|k|\\le k_{c}$, but in the outer region $|k|>k_{c}$ they aggressively undersample by keeping only every $R$-th Cartesian line along the phase-encode direction (with $R>1$ an integer), up to a maximum acquired frequency $k_{\\max}$. Thus, the acquired k-space is given by $S_{\\text{acq}}(k) = s(k)\\, M(k)$, where $M(k)$ equals $1$ on the fully sampled grid for $|k|\\le k_{c}$, equals a periodic impulse train with period $\\Delta k_{\\text{outer}}=R\\, \\Delta k_{\\text{center}}$ for $k_{c}<|k|\\le k_{\\max}$, and equals $0$ for $|k|>k_{\\max}$. Here $\\Delta k_{\\text{center}}$ is the sampling increment in the fully sampled central region.\n\nStarting from the Fourier relationship between object and data, sampling theory, and the interpretation of multiplication in k-space as convolution in image space, reason about the image-domain effects of this acquisition. In particular, consider the point spread function (PSF) and the consequences of both finite k-space extent and nonuniform sampling density.\n\nWhich option best describes how this aggressive undersampling of high-frequency k-space affects (i) edge sharpness of the step and (ii) the dominant aliasing artifacts visible in the reconstructed image along the undersampled direction?\n\nA. The step edge appears blurred due to the reduced $k_{\\max}$, and oscillatory ringing arises near the edge from the abrupt k-space mask; in addition, periodic wrap-around of predominantly high-frequency features appears along the undersampled direction, while low-frequency contrast is largely unaliased because the center is fully sampled.\n\nB. The step edge becomes sharper because eliminating noisy high frequencies suppresses ringing, and no wrap-around occurs since the central k-space is fully sampled.\n\nC. Edge sharpness is unchanged, but strong global ghost copies of the entire object with nearly equal intensity appear across the field of view due to equal-density aliasing from all k-space regions.\n\nD. The step edge is blurred, but any aliasing manifests as a uniform intensity offset rather than wrap-around, because only high-frequency lines were skipped.\n\nE. Edges remain sharp; only the signal-to-noise ratio decreases, and no structured artifacts are introduced by the undersampling pattern.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the image-domain effects of a variable-density k-space sampling scheme. The reconstructed image is the result of convolving the true object with the Point Spread Function (PSF), which is the inverse Fourier transform of the k-space sampling mask. We can analyze the effects on edge sharpness and aliasing by considering the properties of this mask.\n\nThe sampling mask $M(k)$ can be conceptually split into two components: a fully-sampled central part and a sparsely-sampled outer part.\n1.  **Fully-sampled central region ($|k| \\le k_c$):** This region contains the low spatial frequencies, which define the image's overall contrast and large-scale features. Because this region is fully sampled according to the Nyquist criterion set by $\\Delta k_{\\text{center}}$, the low-frequency content of the image will be reconstructed without aliasing.\n2.  **Undersampled outer region ($k_c  |k| \\le k_{\\max}$):** This region contains the high spatial frequencies that define sharp edges and fine details. Here, the sampling increment is effectively increased to $\\Delta k_{\\text{outer}} = R \\cdot \\Delta k_{\\text{center}}$. According to sampling theory, this reduces the effective Field of View (FOV) for this high-frequency information by a factor of $R$. Consequently, high-frequency features from the object will alias, or \"wrap around,\" into the reconstructed image. The final image is a superposition of a non-aliased, low-resolution base image (from the k-space center) and aliased high-frequency details (from the k-space periphery).\n\nNow we can evaluate the two specific aspects:\n\n(i) **Edge Sharpness:** Edge sharpness is determined by the highest spatial frequencies acquired. The acquisition is truncated at $k_{\\max}$, meaning no information is captured for $|k| > k_{\\max}$. This acts as a low-pass filter, which inherently blurs sharp features like the step edge. The spatial resolution is limited by $k_{\\max}$. Furthermore, the sharp cutoffs in the sampling mask (at $k_c$ and $k_{\\max}$) will lead to Gibbs ringing, which manifests as oscillations near the sharp edge in the image.\n\n(ii) **Aliasing Artifacts:** As derived above, the undersampling of the outer k-space causes aliasing. Crucially, this aliasing only affects the information encoded in that region—the high frequencies. Therefore, the artifact will appear as periodic replicas of the object's edges and fine textures, not the entire object. The low-frequency contrast, encoded in the fully-sampled k-space center, remains largely unaliased.\n\nConsidering these points, we assess the options:\n\n- **A:** This option correctly states that the edge will be blurred (due to finite $k_{\\max}$) and exhibit ringing (due to sharp k-space transitions). It also accurately describes the aliasing as a wrap-around of predominantly high-frequency features, while low-frequency contrast is preserved. This matches our analysis perfectly.\n- **B:** Incorrect. Limiting high frequencies blurs edges, it does not sharpen them. Wrap-around of high frequencies will occur.\n- **C:** Incorrect. Edge sharpness is reduced, not unchanged. The aliasing is of high-frequency features, not strong global copies of the entire object, due to the variable-density sampling.\n- **D:** Incorrect. Aliasing from periodic undersampling creates periodic replicas (wrap-around), not a uniform intensity offset.\n- **E:** Incorrect. Edges are blurred, not sharp, and the undersampling introduces structured aliasing artifacts.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the best description of the resulting image artifacts.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4896695"}]}
