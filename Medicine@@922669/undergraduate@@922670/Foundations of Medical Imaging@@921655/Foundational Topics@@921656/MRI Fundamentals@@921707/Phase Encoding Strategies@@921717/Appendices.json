Determine the Time-Optimal Waveform Shape**\n\nA time-optimal gradient pulse that starts and ends at zero amplitude to achieve a specific area is one that utilizes the maximum slew rate, $S_{\\max}$. The shape will be either a triangle (if the peak amplitude is less than $G_{\\max}$) or a trapezoid (if the peak amplitude is clipped at $G_{\\max}$).\n\nTo determine which case applies, we compute the area of a triangular pulse that ramps up to $G_{\\max}$ at $S_{\\max}$ and immediately ramps down at $-S_{\\max}$. The time to ramp up is $t_{ramp} = G_{\\max}/S_{\\max}$. The area of such a minimal-duration, maximal-amplitude triangular pulse, $A_{triangle}$, is:\n$$ A_{triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (\\text{base}) \\cdot (\\text{height}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (2 t_{ramp}) \\cdot G_{\\max} = \\frac{G_{\\max}}{S_{\\max}} \\cdot G_{\\max} = \\frac{G_{\\max}^2}{S_{\\max}} $$\nSubstituting the hardware limits, $G_{\\max} = 0.04\\ \\text{T}\\ \\text{m}^{-1}$ and $S_{\\max} = 150\\ \\text{T}\\ \\text{m}^{-1}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$:\n$$ A_{triangle} = \\frac{(0.04)^2}{150} = \\frac{0.0016}{150} \\ \\text{T}\\ \\text{s}\\ \\text{m}^{-1} \\approx 1.0667 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{T}\\ \\text{s}\\ \\text{m}^{-1} $$\nWe compare the required area $A_{blip}$ with $A_{triangle}$:\n$$ A_{blip} \\approx 9.7855 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{T}\\ \\text{s}\\ \\text{m}^{-1} $$\n$$ A_{triangle} \\approx 1.0667 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{T}\\ \\text{s}\\ \\text{m}^{-1} $$\nSince $A_{blip}  A_{triangle}$, the gradient blip will not reach the maximum amplitude $G_{\\max}$. The time-optimal shape is therefore a symmetric triangle.\n\n**4. Calculate the Minimal Duration**\n\nFor a symmetric triangular pulse of total duration $T$, the gradient ramps to a peak amplitude $G_{peak}$ in time $T/2$ and back to zero in the subsequent time $T/2$. The slew rate is constant during the ramps, so $S_{\\max} = G_{peak} / (T/2)$, which implies $G_{peak} = S_{\\max} T / 2$.\nThe area of this triangle is given by:\n$$ A_{blip} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (\\text{base}) \\cdot (\\text{height}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot T \\cdot G_{peak} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $G_{peak}$:\n$$ A_{blip} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot T \\cdot \\left(\\frac{S_{\\max} T}{2}\\right) = \\frac{S_{\\max} T^2}{4} $$\nWe can now solve for the minimal duration, $T_{min} = T$:\n$$ T_{min}^2 = \\frac{4 A_{blip}}{S_{\\max}} \\implies T_{min} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4 A_{blip}}{S_{\\max}}} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{A_{blip}}{S_{\\max}}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $A_{blip}$ and the value of $S_{\\max}$:\n$$ T_{min} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{1/(10219200)}{150}} \\ \\text{s} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{10219200 \\times 150}} \\ \\text{s} $$\n$$ T_{min} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{1532880000}} \\ \\text{s} \\approx 5.108266 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\text{s} $$\nThe problem asks for the duration in milliseconds, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ T_{min} \\approx (5.108266 \\times 10^{-5}) \\ \\text{s} \\times \\left(\\frac{1000 \\ \\text{ms}}{1 \\ \\text{s}}\\right) = 0.05108266 \\ \\text{ms} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the minimal duration is $0.05108\\ \\text{ms}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.05108}$$", "id": "4909351"}, {"introduction": "Building on the design of a single gradient pulse, this practice explores how an entire sequence of phase-encode steps impacts the imaging acquisition.

Set Up the SENSE Equations**\nThe signal measured in each coil at the aliased pixel location $\\tilde{y}$ is the sum of the true magnetizations from the aliased locations, each weighted by that coil's sensitivity at that location. Let $\\rho(y_a)$ and $\\rho(y_b)$ be the true, unaliased magnetizations we want to find.\nFor coil 1: $s_1(\\tilde{y}) = c_1(y_a) \\rho(y_a) + c_1(y_b) \\rho(y_b)$\nFor coil 2: $s_2(\\tilde{y}) = c_2(y_a) \\rho(y_a) + c_2(y_b) \\rho(y_b)$\n\nThis system of linear equations can be written in matrix form $\\mathbf{s} = \\mathbf{C} \\boldsymbol{\\rho}$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} s_1 \\\\ s_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} c_1(y_a)  c_1(y_b) \\\\ c_2(y_a)  c_2(y_b) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho(y_a) \\\\ \\rho(y_b) \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**3. Substitute Values and Solve the System**\nSubstitute the given values into the matrix equation:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 3.0 \\\\ 1.0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.0  0.5 \\\\ 1.0  -0.5 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho(-6\\,\\mathrm{cm}) \\\\ \\rho(4\\,\\mathrm{cm}) \\end{pmatrix} $$\nTo solve for the vector of magnetizations $\\boldsymbol{\\rho}$, we pre-multiply by the inverse of the coil sensitivity matrix $\\mathbf{C}$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\rho} = \\mathbf{C}^{-1} \\mathbf{s} $$\nFirst, calculate the inverse of $\\mathbf{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.0  0.5 \\\\ 1.0  -0.5 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe determinant of $\\mathbf{C}$ is $\\det(\\mathbf{C}) = (1.0)(-0.5) - (0.5)(1.0) = -0.5 - 0.5 = -1.0$.\nThe inverse matrix is:\n$$ \\mathbf{C}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(\\mathbf{C})} \\begin{pmatrix} -0.5  -0.5 \\\\ -1.0  1.0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{-1.0} \\begin{pmatrix} -0.5  -0.5 \\\\ -1.0  1.0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.5  0.5 \\\\ 1.0  -1.0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, multiply $\\mathbf{C}^{-1}$ by the signal vector $\\mathbf{s}$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho(-6\\,\\mathrm{cm}) \\\\ \\rho(4\\,\\mathrm{cm}) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.5  0.5 \\\\ 1.0  -1.0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3.0 \\\\ 1.0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\rho(-6\\,\\mathrm{cm}) = (0.5)(3.0) + (0.5)(1.0) = 1.5 + 0.5 = 2.0 $$\n$$ \\rho(4\\,\\mathrm{cm}) = (1.0)(3.0) + (-1.0)(1.0) = 3.0 - 1.0 = 2.0 $$\nThe unaliased magnetizations are $\\rho(-6\\,\\mathrm{cm}) = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{a.u.}$ and $\\rho(4\\,\\mathrm{cm}) = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{a.u.}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the magnetization at $y=4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, rounded to four significant figures. The recovered value is $2.0\\,\\mathrm{a.u.}$, which is written as $2.000\\,\\mathrm{a.u.}$ to four significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.000}$$", "id": "4909352"}]}
