At $t=0$, a perfect inversion radiofrequency pulse that rotates the net magnetization by $180^{\\circ}$ about a transverse axis instantaneously sets $M_z(0) = -M_0$ and $M_x(0) = 0$, $M_y(0) = 0$. Immediately after the pulse, the system evolves freely under $B_0$ with longitudinal (spin-lattice) relaxation characterized by the time constant $T_1$, and no further radiofrequency is applied. Transverse relaxation and any effects beyond longitudinal recovery are negligible for the purpose of this question.\n\nStarting from the Bloch equations for nuclear magnetization and the definition of the longitudinal relaxation time $T_1$, derive the analytic expression for the longitudinal magnetization $M_z(t)$ for $t>0$ in terms of $M_0$, $T_1$, and $t$. Then determine the earliest time $t_z$ such that $M_z(t_z) = 0$, i.e., the time of the zero crossing during inversion recovery.

A key property of a monoexponential function is that its logarithmic derivative is a constant:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\ln(f(t)) = \\frac{d}{dt} (\\ln(C) - \\lambda t) = -\\lambda $$\nConversely, if the logarithmic derivative of a function is not constant with respect to time, the function is not monoexponential.\n\nLet us compute the logarithmic derivative of the total signal $S(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\ln(S(t)) = \\frac{1}{S(t)} \\frac{d S(t)}{dt} = \\frac{\\frac{d}{dt} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} A_k \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_{2,k}^{*}}\\right)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} A_k \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_{2,k}^{*}}\\right)} $$\nCalculating the derivative in the numerator:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} A_k \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_{2,k}^{*}}\\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} A_k \\left(-\\frac{1}{T_{2,k}^{*}}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_{2,k}^{*}}\\right) $$\nThus, the logarithmic derivative is:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\ln(S(t)) = -\\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{A_k}{T_{2,k}^{*}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_{2,k}^{*}}\\right)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} A_k \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_{2,k}^{*}}\\right)} $$\nThis expression is a time-dependent weighted average of the individual decay rates $1/T_{2,k}^{*}$. The weights themselves, $\\frac{A_k \\exp(-t/T_{2,k}^{*})}{\\sum_j A_j \\exp(-t/T_{2,j}^{*})}$, change with time. Because the components with shorter $T_{2,k}^{*}$ decay faster, their contribution to the sum diminishes more rapidly, causing the overall instantaneous decay rate to change over time. The expression is only constant if all $T_{2,k}^{*}$ are identical (i.e., $N=1$ or all subregions are of the same type). Therefore, in the general case where multiple distinct $T_{2,k}^{*}$ values are present, the total signal $S(t)$ is not a single exponential function of time.\n\n**Part 2 & 3: Derivation of the Apparent $T_{2,\\mathrm{app}}^{*}$**\n\nWe are asked to define a monoexponential approximation, $S_{\\mathrm{app}}(t)$, of the form:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{app}}(t) = A_{\\mathrm{app}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_{2,\\mathrm{app}}^{*}}\\right) $$\nThis approximation must satisfy two conditions at $t=0$:\n1.  It has the same initial amplitude as $S(t)$: $S_{\\mathrm{app}}(0) = S(0)$.\n2.  It has the same initial logarithmic decay rate as $S(t)$: $\\left. \\frac{d}{dt} \\ln(S_{\\mathrm{app}}(t)) \\right|_{t=0} = \\left. \\frac{d}{dt} \\ln(S(t)) \\right|_{t=0}$.\n\n**Condition 1: Initial Amplitude**\nFirst, we evaluate $S(t)$ and $S_{\\mathrm{app}}(t)$ at $t=0$:\n$$ S(0) = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} A_k \\exp(0) = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} A_k $$\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{app}}(0) = A_{\\mathrm{app}} \\exp(0) = A_{\\mathrm{app}} $$\nEquating these gives the initial amplitude of the approximation:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{app}} = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} A_k $$\n\n**Condition 2: Initial Logarithmic Decay Rate**\nFirst, we find the logarithmic derivative of the approximation $S_{\\mathrm{app}}(t)$:\n$$ \\ln(S_{\\mathrm{app}}(t)) = \\ln(A_{\\mathrm{app}}) - \\frac{t}{T_{2,\\mathrm{app}}^{*}} $$\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\ln(S_{\\mathrm{app}}(t)) = -\\frac{1}{T_{2,\\mathrm{app}}^{*}} $$\nThis rate is constant, so its value at $t=0$ is also $-1/T_{2,\\mathrm{app}}^{*}$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the logarithmic derivative of the true signal $S(t)$ at $t=0$:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{d}{dt} \\ln(S(t)) \\right|_{t=0} = \\left. -\\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{A_k}{T_{2,k}^{*}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_{2,k}^{*}}\\right)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} A_k \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_{2,k}^{*}}\\right)} \\right|_{t=0} $$\nSubstituting $t=0$:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{d}{dt} \\ln(S(t)) \\right|_{t=0} = -\\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{A_k}{T_{2,k}^{*}} \\exp(0)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} A_k \\exp(0)} = -\\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{A_k}{T_{2,k}^{*}}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} A_k} $$\n\nNow, we equate the two initial logarithmic decay rates as per the problem's definition:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{T_{2,\\mathrm{app}}^{*}} = -\\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{A_k}{T_{2,k}^{*}}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} A_k} $$\nThe negative signs on both sides cancel:\n$$ \\frac{1}{T_{2,\\mathrm{app}}^{*}} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{A_k}{T_{2,k}^{*}}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} A_k} $$\nFinally, to obtain the expression for $T_{2,\\mathrm{app}}^{*}$, we take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$ T_{2,\\mathrm{app}}^{*} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} A_k}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{A_k}{T_{2,k}^{*}}} $$\nThis expression represents the apparent $T_2^*$ as the amplitude-weighted harmonic mean of the individual $T_{2,k}^{*}$ values of the subregions. It provides a monoexponential approximation that is accurate for the initial part of the decay.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} A_{k}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{A_{k}}{T_{2,k}^{*}}}}\n$$", "id": "4930525"}]}
