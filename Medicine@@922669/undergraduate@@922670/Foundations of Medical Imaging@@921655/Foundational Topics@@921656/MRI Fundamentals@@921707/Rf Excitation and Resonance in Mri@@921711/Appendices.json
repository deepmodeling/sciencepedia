Calculate the voxel-wise mean, population standard deviation, and range (maximum - minimum) of the flip angles and round them as required.\n\nThis procedure is applied to each of the three test cases, and the results are aggregated into the final output list.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the MRI flip angle calculation problem for three test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the gyromagnetic ratio for hydrogen (proton) in rad/s/T\n    GAMMA = 2 * np.pi * 42.577e6\n\n    results = []\n\n    # Wrapper function to process a single test case\n    def process_case(s_map, E_func, t_start, t_end, dt):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes flip angle statistics for a given test case.\n\n        Args:\n            s_map (np.ndarray): Spatial map of B1+ scaling factors.\n            E_func (callable): Function that returns the RF envelope magnitude |E(t)|.\n            t_start (float): Start time of the integration interval in seconds.\n            t_end (float): End time of the integration interval in seconds.\n            dt (float): Time step in seconds.\n\n        Returns:\n            tuple: (mean, std_dev, range) of flip angles in degrees.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Create the time grid, ensuring the endpoint is included\n        t_grid = np.arange(t_start, t_end + dt / 2, dt)\n        \n        # Evaluate the RF envelope magnitude on the time grid\n        E_t = E_func(t_grid)\n        \n        # Numerically integrate |E(t)| using the trapezoidal rule\n        integral_E = np.trapz(E_t, t_grid)\n        \n        # Calculate the base flip angle in radians (for s=1)\n        alpha_base_rad = GAMMA * integral_E\n        \n        # Calculate the flip angle for each voxel in the spatial map\n        # Flatten the map for easier computation of statistics\n        s_values = s_map.flatten()\n        alpha_map_rad = s_values * alpha_base_rad\n        \n        # Convert flip angles to degrees\n        alpha_map_deg = np.degrees(alpha_map_rad)\n        \n        # Compute summary statistics\n        mean_angle = np.mean(alpha_map_deg)\n        # Population standard deviation (ddof=0 is the default)\n        std_dev_angle = np.std(alpha_map_deg, ddof=0)\n        # Range (max - min)\n        range_angle = np.ptp(alpha_map_deg)\n        \n        return mean_angle, std_dev_angle, range_angle\n\n    # --- Test Case 1: Uniform B1+, Rectangular Pulse ---\n    s_map_1 = np.ones((3, 3, 1))\n    B1_amp_1 = 10e-6  # Tesla\n    tau_1 = 1e-3      # seconds\n    dt_1 = 1e-6       # seconds\n    E_func_1 = lambda t: np.full_like(t, B1_amp_1)\n    \n    metrics_1 = process_case(s_map_1, E_func_1, 0, tau_1, dt_1)\n    results.extend(metrics_1)\n\n    # --- Test Case 2: Linearly Varying B1+, Gaussian Pulse ---\n    s_map_2 = np.array([0.8, 0.8 + 0.4 / 3, 0.8 + 2 * 0.4 / 3, 1.2])\n    B1_amp_2 = 8e-6   # Tesla\n    sigma_2 = 0.3e-3  # seconds\n    t_half_dur_2 = 1.2e-3  # seconds\n    dt_2 = 1e-6       # seconds\n    E_func_2 = lambda t: B1_amp_2 * np.exp(-t**2 / (2 * sigma_2**2))\n\n    metrics_2 = process_case(s_map_2, E_func_2, -t_half_dur_2, t_half_dur_2, dt_2)\n    results.extend(metrics_2)\n\n    # --- Test Case 3: Heterogeneous B1+, Half-Sine Pulse ---\n    s_map_3 = np.array([0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5])\n    B1_amp_3 = 6e-6   # Tesla\n    tau_3 = 2e-3      # seconds\n    dt_3 = 1e-6       # seconds\n    E_func_3 = lambda t: B1_amp_3 * np.sin(np.pi * t / tau_3)\n\n    metrics_3 = process_case(s_map_3, E_func_3, 0, tau_3, dt_3)\n    results.extend(metrics_3)\n    \n    # Format the final output string as required\n    # Each value rounded to three decimal places\n    output_str = f\"[{','.join(f'{x:.3f}' for x in results)}]\"\n    print(output_str)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "4920032"}]}
