This displacement arises because the RF pulse, designed to excite a specific range of Larmor frequencies, excites fat and water protons at different spatial locations due to their intrinsic frequency difference.\n\nThe solution is derived from two fundamental principles: the Larmor relation and the effect of a linear magnetic field gradient.\n\n1.  **Larmor Relation and Chemical Shift**: The Larmor frequency, $f$, of a nucleus is directly proportional to the magnetic field, $B$, it experiences:\n    $$f = \\gamma_{\\text{Hz}} B$$\n    where $\\gamma_{\\text{Hz}}$ is the gyromagnetic ratio in units of frequency per magnetic field strength. Due to different molecular environments, protons in fat are more shielded from the main magnetic field $B_0$ than protons in water. This results in a slightly lower Larmor frequency for fat. This difference is quantified by the chemical shift, $\\delta$. The problem states that fat resonates at a chemical shift of $\\delta = 3.5\\,\\text{ppm}$ relative to water. The frequency difference, $\\Delta f_{\\text{cs}}$, at the main field strength $B_0$ is:\n    $$\\Delta f_{\\text{cs}} = \\delta \\cdot f_{\\text{water}}$$\n    where $f_{\\text{water}}$ is the resonance frequency of water at $B_0$. We have $f_{\\text{water}} = \\gamma_{\\text{Hz}} B_0$. Therefore,\n    $$\\Delta f_{\\text{cs}} = \\delta \\gamma_{\\text{Hz}} B_0$$\n    This $\\Delta f_{\\text{cs}}$ represents the frequency by which fat is shifted relative to water, independent of position.\n\n2.  **Slice-Selection Gradient**: During slice selection, a linear magnetic field gradient, $G_z$, is applied along the $z$-axis. This gradient superimposes a position-dependent magnetic field onto the main field $B_0$. The total field at a position $z$ is $B(z) = B_0 + G_z z$. This creates a linear relationship between position and Larmor frequency. A change in position, $\\Delta z$, corresponds to a change in frequency, $\\Delta f_{\\text{grad}}$, given by:\n    $$\\Delta f_{\\text{grad}} = \\gamma_{\\text{Hz}} (G_z \\Delta z)$$\n\n3.  **Determining the Spatial Misregistration**: An RF pulse is centered on a specific frequency, which we assume is the resonance frequency of water at the slice's center ($z=0$). For a fat proton to be excited by this same RF pulse, it must be located at a different position, $\\Delta z_{\\text{fat}}$, such that the frequency shift induced by the gradient exactly cancels the chemical shift frequency difference. In other words, the spatial position must change to bring the fat's Larmor frequency back into resonance with the RF pulse. We equate the magnitudes of the two frequency shifts:\n    $$\\Delta f_{\\text{grad}} = \\Delta f_{\\text{cs}}$$\n    Substituting the expressions from the previous steps:\n    $$\\gamma_{\\text{Hz}} G_z \\Delta z_{\\text{fat}} = \\delta \\gamma_{\\text{Hz}} B_0$$\n    The gyromagnetic ratio, $\\gamma_{\\text{Hz}}$, cancels from both sides, yielding a direct relationship for the spatial misregistration:\n    $$\\Delta z_{\\text{fat}} = \\frac{\\delta B_0}{G_z}$$\n\n4.  **Calculation**: We substitute the given values into this equation.
