The time-averaged SAR, denoted as $\\overline{SAR}$, over a time interval of duration $T_{\\mathrm{avg}}$ is defined as the total energy absorbed per unit mass during that interval, divided by the duration of the interval. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\overline{SAR} = \\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{avg}}} \\int_{t_0}^{t_0 + T_{\\mathrm{avg}}} SAR(t) \\, dt $$\nwhere $SAR(t)$ is the instantaneous SAR at time $t$. The regulatory constraint states that for any such interval, $\\overline{SAR} \\le L_{\\mathrm{WB}}$.\n\nTo find the most stringent condition on the scan parameters, we must consider the averaging interval of duration $T_{\\mathrm{avg}}$ that yields the highest possible value for $\\overline{SAR}$. Since SAR is zero outside the scan period, this worst-case scenario occurs when the averaging window completely contains the scan. Let us define the time variable $t$ such that the scan occurs over the interval $[0, T_{\\mathrm{scan}}]$. The averaging window that maximizes the calculated average SAR is then an interval of length $T_{\\mathrm{avg}}$ that includes this entire scan, for example, $[0, T_{\\mathrm{avg}}]$.\n\nThe instantaneous SAR, $SAR(t)$, is described as follows:\n- During the scan (for $t \\in [0, T_{\\mathrm{scan}}]$): The RF is on for a fraction $D$ of the time. The SAR is $S_{\\mathrm{inst}}$ when the RF is on and negligible ($0$) otherwise.\n- Outside the scan (for $t > T_{\\mathrm{scan}}$): There is no RF activity, so $SAR(t) = 0$.\n\nThe total energy deposited per unit mass, $E_{\\mathrm{dep}}$, over the averaging window $T_{\\mathrm{avg}}$ is the integral of $SAR(t)$ over this window.\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{dep}} = \\int_{0}^{T_{\\mathrm{avg}}} SAR(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{T_{\\mathrm{scan}}} SAR(t) \\, dt + \\int_{T_{\\mathrm{scan}}}^{T_{\\mathrm{avg}}} SAR(t) \\, dt $$\nThe second integral is zero because $SAR(t) = 0$ for $t > T_{\\mathrm{scan}}$.\nThe first integral represents the total energy deposited during the scan. Within the scan of duration $T_{\\mathrm{scan}}$, the total time the RF is active is given by the product of the duty cycle $D$ and the scan duration $T_{\\mathrm{scan}}$. Therefore, the integral is:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{T_{\\mathrm{scan}}} SAR(t) \\, dt = S_{\\mathrm{inst}} \\times (\\text{total time RF is on}) = S_{\\mathrm{inst}} \\cdot D \\cdot T_{\\mathrm{scan}} $$\nThus, the total deposited energy per unit mass over the averaging window is $E_{\\mathrm{dep}} = S_{\\mathrm{inst}} \\cdot D \\cdot T_{\\mathrm{scan}}$.\n\nNow, we can compute the time-averaged SAR over the window $T_{\\mathrm{avg}}$:\n$$ \\overline{SAR} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{dep}}}{T_{\\mathrm{avg}}} = \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{inst}} \\cdot D \\cdot T_{\\mathrm{scan}}}{T_{\\mathrm{avg}}} $$\nThe regulatory requirement is that this quantity must not exceed the whole-body limit $L_{\\mathrm{WB}}$:\n$$ \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{inst}} \\cdot D \\cdot T_{\\mathrm{scan}}}{T_{\\mathrm{avg}}} \\le L_{\\mathrm{WB}} $$\nWe are asked to find the maximum allowable duty cycle, $D_{\\max}$.

The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of electromagnetism and MRI physics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and uses realistic parameters and physically-motivated modeling assumptions.\n\n### Task 1: Conceptual Explanation\n\nThe influence of head size and proximity to the RF coil on the transmit magnetic field ($B_{1}^{+}$) and the electric field ($|E|$) distributions stems from fundamental principles described by Maxwell's equations. An RF transmit coil, such as the birdcage coil specified, consists of conductors carrying time-varying currents. These currents are the primary sources of the electromagnetic fields.\n\nWhen a subject's head, a lossy dielectric medium, is placed inside the coil, it interacts with these primary fields. This interaction, known as \"dielectric loading,\" fundamentally alters the field distributions. The governing equations are Ampere's law, $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{J} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}}{\\partial t}$, and Faraday's law of induction, $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}$.\n\nInside the head tissue, the total current density $\\mathbf{J}$ is the sum of the conduction current, $\\mathbf{J}_{\\mathrm{cond}} = \\sigma\\mathbf{E}$, and the displacement current, $\\mathbf{J}_{\\mathrm{disp}} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}}{\\partial t} = \\epsilon\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}$, where $\\sigma$ is the electrical conductivity and $\\epsilon$ is the permittivity of the tissue. Both currents are driven by the local electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ and act as secondary sources, generating their own electromagnetic fields that superimpose on the primary fields from the coil.\n\nThe effect on the **effective transmit RF magnetic field, $B_{1}^{+}$**, is primarily related to wave behavior. At the Larmor frequencies used in MRI (e.g., approximately $128\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$ for protons at $3\\,\\mathrm{T}$), the wavelength of the RF field within the high-permittivity tissue is significantly shortened. As RF waves propagate from the coil through the tissue to the isocenter, they experience attenuation and phase shifts. The extent of this attenuation and the nature of the interference (constructive or destructive) of waves originating from different parts of the coil depend on the propagation path length and the tissue's electromagnetic properties. A larger head presents a larger dielectric volume, altering these path lengths and the overall boundary conditions. This leads to a different spatial distribution of $B_{1}^{+}$ field amplitude and phase compared to a smaller head. The change in loading also affects the impedance seen by the coil, influencing the total power required to achieve a target $B_{1}^{+}$ amplitude at a specific location, such as the isocenter.\n\nThe effect on the **electric field magnitude, $|E|$**, is governed by two principal mechanisms. The first is the inductive component, which is coupled to the time-varying magnetic field as per Faraday's law. This component is distributed throughout the volume of the head. The second, and often dominant component for peripheral SAR, is the conservative (or capacitive) electric field that arises from charge accumulation on surfaces and is extremely strong in the near-field of the current-carrying coil conductors. Head size critically determines the minimum distance between the tissue and these conductors. For a larger head, the surface of the head is closer to the coil rungs. Since the electric field strength in the near-field of a conductor generally scales inversely with distance, the peripheral tissue of a larger head is exposed to a substantially higher electric field magnitude. This is the primary reason why peak local SAR is highly sensitive to the patient's proximity to the transmit coil elements.\n\nIn summary, head size influences the $B_{1}^{+}$ distribution primarily through bulk wave propagation and interference effects within the dielectric medium, and it influences the peak $|E|$ field magnitude primarily through the proximity of the tissue to the near-field of the coil conductors.\n\n### Task 2: Calculation\n\nThe objective is to compute the ratio of the peak $10\\,\\mathrm{g}$-averaged SAR for the smaller head relative to the larger head, $\\frac{\\mathrm{SAR}_{10\\mathrm{g},\\,\\mathrm{small}}}{\\mathrm{SAR}_{10\\mathrm{g},\\,\\mathrm{large}}}$.\n\nThe problem provides key modeling assumptions. First, the local Specific Absorption Rate is given by:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SAR} = \\frac{\\sigma |E|^{2}}{2\\rho}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the tissue conductivity and $\\rho$ is the mass density. We are told these are the same for both head models.\n\nThe problem states that for the small region where the peak $10\\,\\mathrm{g}$-averaged SAR occurs, we can assume $\\mathrm{SAR}_{10\\mathrm{g}} \\propto |E|^{2}$. This is consistent with the definition, as $\\sigma$ and $\\rho$ are constants that would appear in the proportionality constant. Therefore, the ratio of peak averaged SAR values can be written as the ratio of the squared electric field magnitudes at the respective peak locations:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{SAR}_{10\\mathrm{g},\\,\\mathrm{small}}}{\\mathrm{SAR}_{10\\mathrm{g},\\,\\mathrm{large}}} = \\frac{|E_{\\mathrm{small}}|^{2}}{|E_{\\mathrm{large}}|^{2}} = \\left( \\frac{|E_{\\mathrm{small}}|}{|E_{\\mathrm{large}}|} \\right)^{2}\n$$\nThe peak SAR is stated to occur in the cortex-adjacent region closest to the nearest birdcage rung.\n\nThe problem also provides a scaling law for the electric field magnitude at this location: $|E| \\propto A/d$, where $A$ is the net RF drive amplitude and $d$ is the distance from the conductor to the tissue. Using this proportionality, we can write the ratio of the electric field magnitudes as:\n$$\n\\frac{|E_{\\mathrm{small}}|}{|E_{\\mathrm{large}}|} = \\frac{k \\cdot (A_{\\mathrm{small}} / d_{\\mathrm{small}})}{k \\cdot (A_{\\mathrm{large}} / d_{\\mathrm{large}})} = \\left( \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{small}}}{A_{\\mathrm{large}}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{d_{\\mathrm{large}}}{d_{\\mathrm{small}}} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the constant of proportionality.\n\nSubstituting this expression back into the SAR ratio equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{SAR}_{10\\mathrm{g},\\,\\mathrm{small}}}{\\mathrm{SAR}_{10\\mathrm{g},\\,\\mathrm{large}}} = \\left[ \\left( \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{small}}}{A_{\\mathrm{large}}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{d_{\\mathrm{large}}}{d_{\\mathrm{small}}} \\right) \\right]^{2}\n$$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n-   Coil radius: $R_{\\mathrm{coil}} = 140\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n-   Large head radius: $R_{\\mathrm{large}} = 95\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n-   Small head radius: $R_{\\mathrm{small}} = 80\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n-   Drive amplitude ratio: $\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{small}}}{A_{\\mathrm{large}}} = 0.85$ (since $A_{\\mathrm{small}}$ is lower by $15\\%$)\n\nFirst, we calculate the distances, $d$, from the coil inner surface to the head outer surface for each model:\n$$\nd_{\\mathrm{large}} = R_{\\mathrm{coil}} - R_{\\mathrm{large}} = 140\\,\\mathrm{mm} - 95\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 45\\,\\mathrm{mm}\n$$\n$$\nd_{\\mathrm{small}} = R_{\\mathrm{coil}} - R_{\\mathrm{small}} = 140\\,\\mathrm{mm} - 80\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 60\\,\\mathrm{mm}\n$$\n\nNow, we can compute the ratio of these distances:\n$$\n\\frac{d_{\\mathrm{large}}}{d_{\\mathrm{small}}} = \\frac{45\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{60\\,\\mathrm{mm}} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75\n$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the numerical values for the amplitude ratio and the distance ratio into the equation for the SAR ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{SAR}_{10\\mathrm{g},\\,\\mathrm{small}}}{\\mathrm{SAR}_{10\\mathrm{g},\\,\\mathrm{large}}} = \\left[ (0.85) \\times (0.75) \\right]^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{SAR}_{10\\mathrm{g},\\,\\mathrm{small}}}{\\mathrm{SAR}_{10\\mathrm{g},\\,\\mathrm{large}}} = (0.6375)^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{SAR}_{10\\mathrm{g},\\,\\mathrm{small}}}{\\mathrm{SAR}_{10\\mathrm{g},\\,\\mathrm{large}}} = 0.40640625\n$$\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested, we obtain $0.406$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.406}$$", "id": "4926233"}]}
