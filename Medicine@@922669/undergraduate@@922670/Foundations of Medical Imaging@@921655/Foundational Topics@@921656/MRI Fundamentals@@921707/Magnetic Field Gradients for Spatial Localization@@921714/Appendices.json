A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\nThe derivation proceeds from the fundamental principles provided in the problem statement.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Angular Frequency Shift, $\\Delta \\omega(x)$**\n\nThe total angular frequency, $\\omega(x)$, at a spatial position $x$ is given by the Larmor relation:\n$$\n\\omega(x) = \\gamma B(x)\n$$\nSubstituting the given expression for the total magnetic field, $B(x) = B_0 + G_x x$, we obtain the position-dependent angular frequency:\n$$\n\\omega(x) = \\gamma (B_0 + G_x x) = \\gamma B_0 + \\gamma G_x x\n$$\nThe baseline precession frequency, $\\omega_0$, is the frequency in the absence of the gradient field (i.e., when $G_x = 0$) or at the isocenter ($x=0$). This frequency is determined solely by the static field $B_0$:\n$$\n\\omega_0 = \\gamma B_0\n$$\nThe angular frequency shift, $\\Delta \\omega(x)$, is defined as the change in frequency from this baseline due to the presence of the gradient. It is the difference between the total frequency $\\omega(x)$ and the baseline frequency $\\omega_0$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\omega(x) = \\omega(x) - \\omega_0\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\omega(x)$ and $\\omega_0$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\omega(x) = (\\gamma B_0 + \\gamma G_x x) - (\\gamma B_0)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the expression for the frequency shift:\n$$\n\\Delta \\omega(x) = \\gamma G_x x\n$$\nThe International System of Units (SI) for $\\Delta \\omega(x)$ is determined from the units of the constituent terms. The gyromagnetic ratio $\\gamma$ has units of $\\text{rad} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{T}^{-1}$. The gradient strength $G_x$ has units of $\\text{T} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-1}$. The position $x$ has units of $\\text{m}$. Therefore, the units of $\\Delta \\omega(x)$ are:\n$$\n[\\text{rad} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{T}^{-1}] \\times [\\text{T} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-1}] \\times [\\text{m}] = \\text{rad} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThis is the correct unit for an angular frequency.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Additional Phase, $\\phi(x)$**\n\nPhase, $\\phi(t)$, is the time integral of angular frequency, $\\omega(t)$. The additional phase, $\\phi(x)$, accrued *solely due to the gradient* is the time integral of the *additional* angular frequency, $\\Delta \\omega(x)$, over the time interval $T$ during which the gradient is applied.\n$$\n\\phi(x) = \\int_{0}^{T} \\Delta \\omega(x) \\, dt\n$$\nThe problem states that the gradient $G_x$ is a *constant* linear magnetic field gradient applied during the time interval $0 \\le t \\le T$. Since $\\gamma$, $G_x$, and the spatial position $x$ are all constant with respect to the integration variable $t$, the frequency shift $\\Delta \\omega(x) = \\gamma G_x x$ is also constant over the integration interval.\nTherefore, we can take $\\Delta \\omega(x)$ outside the integral:\n$$\n\\phi(x) = \\Delta \\omega(x) \\int_{0}^{T} dt\n$$\nEvaluating the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} dt = [t]_{0}^{T} = T - 0 = T\n$$\nSubstituting this result back, we find the accumulated phase:\n$$\n\\phi(x) = \\Delta \\omega(x) \\cdot T\n$$\nFinally, substituting the expression for $\\Delta \\omega(x)$:\n$$\n\\phi(x) = (\\gamma G_x x) T = \\gamma G_x x T\n$$\nThe SI unit for $\\phi(x)$ is derived from the units of $\\Delta \\omega(x)$ (rad$\\cdot$s$^{-1}$) and time $T$ (s):\n$$\n[\\text{rad} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}] \\times [\\text{s}] = \\text{rad}\n$$\nThis is the correct unit for a phase angle, as required.\n\nThe final result is a row vector containing the expressions for $\\Delta \\omega(x)$ and $\\phi(x)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\gamma G_{x} x & \\gamma G_{x} x T \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4897840"}, {"introduction": "Having established that a gradient makes frequency a function of position, the next logical step is to use this relationship to encode one dimension of space.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of spatial encoding in MRI lies in making the precessional phase of nuclear spins a function of their spatial location. The problem provides the fundamental relations for this process.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Calculation of $\\Delta A$**\n\nThe spatially-dependent phase, $\\phi(y)$, accumulated during the application of the phase-encode gradient $G_y(t)$ is what encodes position. Starting with the given definition of total phase, $\\phi(y,t) = \\int \\gamma B(y,t)\\,dt$, we substitute the expression for the magnetic field, $B(y,t) = B_0 + y\\,G_y(t)$:\n$$ \\phi(y) = \\int_{\\mathrm{pe}} \\gamma (B_0 + y\\,G_y(t))\\,dt $$\nThe integral is taken over the duration of the phase-encoding gradient, denoted by 'pe'. We can separate the terms:\n$$ \\phi(y) = \\int_{\\mathrm{pe}} \\gamma B_0\\,dt + y \\int_{\\mathrm{pe}} \\gamma G_y(t)\\,dt $$\nThe first term, $\\int_{\\mathrm{pe}} \\gamma B_0\\,dt$, is a phase offset that is constant with respect to the spatial coordinate $y$. It does not contribute to spatial encoding and can be disregarded. The second term contains the spatial information. We can pull the constants $y$ and $\\gamma$ out of the integral:\n$$ \\phi_{\\mathrm{enc}}(y) = \\gamma y \\int_{\\mathrm{pe}} G_y(t)\\,dt $$\nThe problem defines the area of the gradient lobe as $A \\equiv \\int G_y(t)\\,dt$. Thus, the encoding phase is:\n$$ \\phi_{\\mathrm{enc}}(y) = \\gamma y A $$\nNext, we use the given definition of the k-space coordinate, $k_y = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}$. The phase $\\phi$ in this definition refers to the total accumulated phase that varies with $y$. Applying this to our encoding phase:\n$$ k_y = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (\\gamma y A) = \\frac{\\gamma A}{2\\pi} $$\nThis equation establishes a direct proportionality between the k-space coordinate $k_y$ and the area of the applied phase-encoding gradient lobe $A$.\n\nThe problem requires that the chosen sampling strategy avoids aliasing across the field of view $FOV_y$. This invokes the Nyquist sampling theorem as applied to spatial frequencies (k-space). The theorem dictates that the spacing between samples in k-space, $\\Delta k_y$, is determined by the extent of the object in the spatial domain, $FOV_y$. The relationship is:\n$$ \\Delta k_y = \\frac{1}{FOV_y} $$\nSince $k_y$ is proportional to $A$, a discrete step $\\Delta k_y$ in k-space must be achieved by applying a discrete increment in gradient area, $\\Delta A$. From the relation $k_y = \\frac{\\gamma A}{2\\pi}$, we can write the relationship for the increments:\n$$ \\Delta k_y = \\frac{\\gamma \\Delta A}{2\\pi} $$\nBy equating the two expressions for $\\Delta k_y$, we can solve for the required minimum increment in gradient area, $\\Delta A$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{FOV_y} = \\frac{\\gamma \\Delta A}{2\\pi} $$\n$$ \\Delta A = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\gamma FOV_y} $$\nThis is the required analytical expression for $\\Delta A$. Now, we compute its numerical value using the provided constants: $\\gamma = 2.675\\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{rad\\,s^{-1}\\,T^{-1}}$ and $FOV_y = 0.24\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n$$ \\Delta A = \\frac{2\\pi}{(2.675\\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{rad\\,s^{-1}\\,T^{-1}}) \\times (0.24\\ \\mathrm{m})} = \\frac{2\\pi}{6.42 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{rad\\,s^{-1}\\,T^{-1}\\,m}} $$\n$$ \\Delta A \\approx 9.78441 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{T\\cdot s/m} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$ \\Delta A = 9.784 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{T\\cdot s/m} $$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Phase-Encode Lobe Amplitude $G_n$**\n\nThe goal is to design a set of gradient amplitudes $G_n$ for a rectangular pulse of duration $\\tau_{\\mathrm{pe}}$ that results in $N_y$ uniformly spaced k-space lines centered at zero. The index $n$ runs from $0$ to $N_y-1$.\n\nTo center the k-space acquisition, the set of sampled $k_y$ values must be symmetric about $k_y=0$. For an index $n$ from $0$ to $N_y-1$, a symmetric set of values can be generated by shifting the index by its mean value, which is $\\frac{N_y-1}{2}$. The position of the $n$-th k-space line is therefore:\n$$ k_y(n) = \\left( n - \\frac{N_y-1}{2} \\right) \\Delta k_y $$\nFor example, with $N_y=128$, the term $(n - \\frac{127}{2})$ runs from $-63.5$ to $+63.5$ in integer steps, creating a symmetric set of multipliers.\n\nWe already established that $k_y = \\frac{\\gamma A}{2\\pi}$. For a rectangular gradient pulse of amplitude $G_n$ and duration $\\tau_{\\mathrm{pe}}$, the area $A_n$ is simply their product: $A_n = G_n \\tau_{\\mathrm{pe}}$. Substituting this into the k-space equation gives the k-space position for the $n$-th encoding step:\n$$ k_y(n) = \\frac{\\gamma G_n \\tau_{\\mathrm{pe}}}{2\\pi} $$\nNow, we equate the two expressions for $k_y(n)$ to find the required gradient amplitude $G_n$:\n$$ \\frac{\\gamma G_n \\tau_{\\mathrm{pe}}}{2\\pi} = \\left( n - \\frac{N_y-1}{2} \\right) \\Delta k_y $$\nSubstituting the expression for the k-space step, $\\Delta k_y = \\frac{1}{FOV_y}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\gamma G_n \\tau_{\\mathrm{pe}}}{2\\pi} = \\left( n - \\frac{N_y-1}{2} \\right) \\frac{1}{FOV_y} $$\nFinally, we solve for $G_n$ to obtain the closed-form expression in terms of the specified variables:\n$$ G_n = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\gamma \\tau_{\\mathrm{pe}} FOV_y} \\left( n - \\frac{N_y-1}{2} \\right) $$\nThis expression defines the amplitude of the phase-encoding gradient for the $n$-th step, ensuring a symmetric and uniform sampling of k-space that satisfies the Nyquist criterion for the specified $FOV_y$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n9.784 \\times 10^{-8} & \\frac{2\\pi}{\\gamma \\tau_{\\mathrm{pe}} FOV_y} \\left( n - \\frac{N_y - 1}{2} \\right)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4897851"}]}
