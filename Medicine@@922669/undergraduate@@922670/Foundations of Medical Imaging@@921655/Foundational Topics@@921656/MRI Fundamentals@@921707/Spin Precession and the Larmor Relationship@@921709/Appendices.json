It is scientifically grounded in the principles of nuclear magnetic resonance, well-posed, and all necessary parameters and definitions are provided for a unique solution. The problem will be solved in two parts as requested.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Flip Angle Equation\n\nThe starting point is the classical equation of motion for the macroscopic magnetization vector $\\mathbf{M}$ in a magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$, which is the Bloch equation without relaxation:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{M}}{dt} = \\gamma (\\mathbf{M} \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio. The total magnetic field is the sum of the static field $\\mathbf{B}_0 = B_0 \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ and the RF field $\\mathbf{B}_1(t)$.\n\nTo simplify the dynamics, we analyze the motion in a coordinate frame that rotates about the $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$-axis at the Larmor frequency. For an on-resonant pulse, we set the frame's angular velocity $\\mathbf{\\Omega}$ such that it cancels the effect of the main field $\\mathbf{B}_0$. In this rotating frame, the equation of motion becomes:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d\\mathbf{M}}{dt}\\right)_r = \\gamma (\\mathbf{M} \\times \\mathbf{B}_{\\text{eff}})\n$$\nwhere the effective magnetic field, $\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{eff}}$, is given by $\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{eff}} = \\mathbf{B} + \\mathbf{\\Omega}/\\gamma$. We choose the frame's rotation to be that of the Larmor precession, which for a positive $\\gamma$ (like a proton) is a clockwise rotation about $\\mathbf{B}_0$. Thus, $\\mathbf{\\Omega} = -\\omega_0 \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = -\\gamma B_0 \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The effective field becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{eff}} = (B_0 \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} + \\mathbf{B}_{1,r}(t)) + \\frac{(-\\gamma B_0 \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})}{\\gamma} = B_0 \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} + \\mathbf{B}_{1,r}(t) - B_0 \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = \\mathbf{B}_{1,r}(t)\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{B}_{1,r}(t)$ is the RF field viewed in the rotating frame. This powerful result shows that in the on-resonant rotating frame, the strong static field $B_0$ is effectively canceled, and the magnetization vector $\\mathbf{M}$ precesses only around the applied RF field.\n\nThe problem states that the effective RF field in the rotating frame is $\\mathbf{B}_{1,r}(t) = B_1(t) \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}'$. From here on, all analysis is in the rotating frame, so the subscript $r$ will be omitted. The equation of motion simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{M}}{dt} = \\gamma (\\mathbf{M} \\times B_1(t)\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}')\n$$\nThis describes a precession of the magnetization vector $\\mathbf{M}$ about the $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}'$ axis. The instantaneous angular frequency of this precession is $\\omega_1(t) = \\gamma B_1(t)$ (assuming $\\gamma > 0$ and $B_1(t) \\ge 0$).\n\nThe total angle of this rotation, known as the flip angle $\\alpha$, is the time integral of the angular frequency over the duration of the RF pulse:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\int_{-\\tau/2}^{\\tau/2} \\omega_1(t) dt = \\int_{-\\tau/2}^{\\tau/2} \\gamma B_1(t) dt\n$$\nSince $\\gamma$ is a constant, we can factor it out of the integral:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\gamma \\int_{-\\tau/2}^{\\tau/2} B_1(t) dt\n$$\nThis is the desired relationship. The constant is the gyromagnetic ratio, $\\gamma$.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of the Flip Angle\n\nWe are given the RF envelope:\n$$\nB_1(t) = B_{1,\\mathrm{peak}}\\,\\operatorname{sinc}\\!\\left( \\frac{2\\pi t}{\\tau} \\right) = B_{1,\\mathrm{peak}}\\,\\frac{\\sin(2\\pi t/\\tau)}{2\\pi t/\\tau} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad -\\frac{\\tau}{2} \\le t \\le \\frac{\\tau}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\gamma \\int_{-\\tau/2}^{\\tau/2} B_{1,\\mathrm{peak}}\\,\\frac{\\sin(2\\pi t/\\tau)}{2\\pi t/\\tau} dt\n$$\nTo evaluate the integral, we perform a change of variables. Let $u = \\frac{2\\pi t}{\\tau}$. Then $du = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\tau} dt$, which implies $dt = \\frac{\\tau}{2\\pi} du$.

The problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of nuclear magnetic resonance and is well-posed.\n\n**Derivation of the Spatial Shift $\\Delta z$**\n\nThe Larmor relationship states that the angular precessional frequency, $\\omega$, of a spin is directly proportional to the magnetic field strength, $B$, it experiences:\n$$\n\\omega = \\gamma B\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n\nThe problem states that a linear magnetic field gradient, $G_z$, is applied along the $z$-axis, such that the total magnetic field at any position $z$ is given by:\n$$\nB(z) = B_0 + G_z z\n$$\nHere, $B_0$ is the main static magnetic field, which corresponds to the field strength at the isocenter of the magnet ($z=0$). Combining these two equations gives the spatially dependent Larmor frequency:\n$$\n\\omega(z) = \\gamma B(z) = \\gamma (B_0 + G_z z) = \\gamma B_0 + \\gamma G_z z\n$$\nIn a standard slice-selection experiment, the radiofrequency (RF) pulse is designed to have a carrier frequency, $\\omega_{RF}$, that matches the Larmor frequency at the center of the desired slice, $z_0$. Let us call this ideal RF frequency $\\omega_{RF, ideal}$. The resonance condition at the planned slice center $z_0$ is:\n$$\n\\omega_{RF, ideal} = \\omega(z_0) = \\gamma (B_0 + G_z z_0)\n$$\nThe problem introduces a uniform frequency detuning, $\\Delta \\omega$, of the RF transmitter. The actual transmitted RF frequency, $\\omega_{RF, actual}$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\omega_{RF, actual} = \\omega_{RF, ideal} + \\Delta \\omega\n$$\nResonance will now occur at a new spatial position, $z_{new}$, where the local Larmor frequency matches this new, actual RF frequency:\n$$\n\\omega(z_{new}) = \\omega_{RF, actual}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\omega(z_{new})$ and $\\omega_{RF, actual}$:\n$$\n\\gamma (B_0 + G_z z_{new}) = \\omega_{RF, ideal} + \\Delta \\omega\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $\\omega_{RF, ideal}$:\n$$\n\\gamma (B_0 + G_z z_{new}) = \\gamma (B_0 + G_z z_0) + \\Delta \\omega\n$$\nExpanding both sides gives:\n$$\n\\gamma B_0 + \\gamma G_z z_{new} = \\gamma B_0 + \\gamma G_z z_0 + \\Delta \\omega\n$$\nThe term $\\gamma B_0$ cancels out:\n$$\n\\gamma G_z z_{new} = \\gamma G_z z_0 + \\Delta \\omega\n$$\nRearranging to find the difference between the new and planned slice positions:\n$$\n\\gamma G_z z_{new} - \\gamma G_z z_0 = \\Delta \\omega\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma G_z (z_{new} - z_0) = \\Delta \\omega\n$$\nThe spatial shift of the excited slice center is $\\Delta z = z_{new} - z_0$. Therefore, we have:\n$$\n\\gamma G_z \\Delta z = \\Delta \\omega\n$$\nSolving for the spatial shift, $\\Delta z$, we obtain the desired expression:\n$$\n\\Delta z = \\frac{\\Delta \\omega}{\\gamma G_z}\n$$\nThis expression shows that the spatial shift of the slice is directly proportional to the frequency detuning and inversely proportional to the product of the gyromagnetic ratio and the gradient strength.\n\n**Physical Mechanism of Slice Profile Distortion**\n\nThe above derivation considers only the shift of the slice center, implicitly assuming an infinitely narrow excitation bandwidth (a \"hard\" pulse) that excites only a single frequency. However, realistic RF pulses have a finite duration and, by the properties of the Fourier transform, a finite frequency bandwidth. The shape of the excited slice profile is, in the small-tip-angle approximation, the Fourier transform of the RF pulse envelope.\n\nWhen a spin is off-resonance, its precession in the rotating frame of reference (which rotates at $\\omega_{RF}$) leads to a modification of the effective magnetic field, $\\vec{B}_{eff}$. In this frame, the effective field is the vector sum of the applied RF field, $\\vec{B}_1(t)$, and an effective static field along the $z'$-axis that represents the frequency offset, $\\Delta \\omega(z) = \\omega(z) - \\omega_{RF, actual}$.\n$$\n\\vec{B}_{eff}(z, t) = \\vec{B}_1(t) + \\frac{\\omega(z) - \\omega_{RF, actual}}{\\gamma}\\hat{k}'\n$$\nSpins precess about this effective field. At the new resonant center, $z_{new}$, the frequency offset is zero, and $\\vec{B}_{eff} = \\vec{B}_1(t)$, causing spins to tip purely in the transverse plane as intended.\n\nHowever, for spins at other positions within the slice (i.e., $z \\neq z_{new}$), the frequency offset term is non-zero. This causes the $\\vec{B}_{eff}$ vector to be tilted away from the transverse plane. The angle of this tilt increases with the magnitude of the off-resonance. As spins precess around this tilted effective field, two primary distortion effects occur:\n1.  **Reduced Flip Angle**: The projection of the final magnetization vector onto the transverse plane is reduced. This means the off-resonant spins experience a smaller effective flip angle, leading to a decrease in the signal amplitude at the edges of the slice profile.\n2.  **Asymmetry and Phase Errors**: The constant detuning $\\Delta \\omega$ introduces a bias to the frequency offset profile across the slice. The offset $\\omega(z)-\\omega_{RF, actual} = \\gamma G_z(z - z_0) - \\Delta\\omega = \\gamma G_z(z - z_{new})$. While this offset is symmetric about the new center $z_{new}$, its interaction with a non-ideal RF pulse envelope (e.g., a truncated sinc pulse) is complex. The trajectory of the magnetization during the pulse becomes more complicated, inducing non-linear phase variations across the slice and often causing the slice profile to become asymmetric, with one side being suppressed more than the other and an exaggeration of side-lobe (ripple) artifacts.\n\nIn summary, off-resonance alters the magnitude and direction of the effective field in a position-dependent manner across the slice, causing deviations from the intended spin nutation. This leads to amplitude and phase distortions that warp the slice profile beyond a simple rigid spatial shift.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe use the derived formula $\\Delta z = \\frac{\\Delta \\omega}{\\gamma G_z}$ with the given values.\nThe parameters are:\n- $\\gamma = 2.675 \\times 10^8 \\ \\mathrm{rad}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{T}^{-1}$\n- $G_z = 30 \\ \\mathrm{mT}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1} = 30 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{T}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n- $\\Delta \\omega = 2\\pi \\times 150 \\ \\mathrm{rad}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 942.4778 \\ \\mathrm{rad}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, calculate the product $\\gamma G_z$:\n$$\n\\gamma G_z = (2.675 \\times 10^8 \\ \\mathrm{rad}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{T}^{-1}) \\times (30 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{T}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}) = 8.025 \\times 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{rad}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, calculate the spatial shift $\\Delta z$:\n$$\n\\Delta z = \\frac{2\\pi \\times 150 \\ \\mathrm{rad}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{8.025 \\times 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{rad}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}} \\approx \\frac{942.4778}{8.025 \\times 10^6} \\ \\mathrm{m} \\approx 1.174427 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the result in millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}$).

The reconstructed image is obtained by performing a 2D Inverse Fourier Transform on the acquired $k$-space data, $S(k_x, k_y)$. We focus on the phase-encoding direction, which we denote by $y$.\n\nFor a discrete acquisition, the reconstructed image profile along the phase-encoding direction, $\\rho(n_y)$, is related to the $k$-space data, $S(m)$, by the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT):\n$$\n\\rho(n_y) = C \\sum_{m=0}^{N_{\\mathrm{pe}}-1} S(m) \\exp\\left(i \\frac{2\\pi m n_y}{N_{\\mathrm{pe}}}\\right)\n$$\nHere, $n_y$ is the pixel index in the image, $m$ is the index for the phase-encoding line in $k$-space (from $0$ to $N_{\\mathrm{pe}}-1$), $N_{\\mathrm{pe}}$ is the total number of phase-encoding lines, and $C$ is a normalization constant.\n\nIn the presence of an off-resonance angular frequency $\\Delta\\omega$, the signal from a spin acquires an additional time-dependent phase. In the rotating-frame picture conventional to MRI, the signal evolution due to off-resonance is described by a phase factor $\\exp(-i\\Delta\\omega t)$.\n\nIn Echo Planar Imaging (EPI), the $N_{\\mathrm{pe}}$ lines of $k$-space are acquired sequentially. The problem states a constant echo spacing $T_{\\mathrm{esp}}$ between the start times of adjacent lines. Assuming the acquisition of the first line ($m=0$) starts at $t=0$, the acquisition of the $m$-th line starts at time:\n$$\nt_m = m \\cdot T_{\\mathrm{esp}}\n$$\nTherefore, the signal for the $m$-th $k$-space line, $S_{\\mathrm{meas}}(m)$, is the ideal signal, $S_{\\mathrm{ideal}}(m)$, multiplied by the phase factor corresponding to the time $t_m$:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{meas}}(m) = S_{\\mathrm{ideal}}(m) \\exp(-i \\Delta\\omega t_m) = S_{\\mathrm{ideal}}(m) \\exp(-i \\Delta\\omega m T_{\\mathrm{esp}})\n$$\nThe term $\\exp(-i \\Delta\\omega m T_{\\mathrm{esp}})$ represents a linear phase ramp across the $k$-space lines, as the phase is directly proportional to the line index $m$.\n\nTo find the effect of this phase ramp on the reconstructed image, we use the Fourier Shift Theorem for the IDFT. The theorem states that a multiplication by a linear phase factor in the frequency domain corresponds to a shift in the spatial domain. The IDFT of a phase-shifted signal $X(k) \\exp(-i 2\\pi k \\Delta n/N)$ is $x(n-\\Delta n)$, where $x(n)$ is the IDFT of $X(k)$.\n\nWe equate the phase factor from our measured signal with the general phase factor from the shift theorem:\n$$\n\\exp(-i \\Delta\\omega m T_{\\mathrm{esp}}) = \\exp\\left(-i \\frac{2\\pi m \\Delta n}{N_{\\mathrm{pe}}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta n$ is the resulting shift in pixels.
