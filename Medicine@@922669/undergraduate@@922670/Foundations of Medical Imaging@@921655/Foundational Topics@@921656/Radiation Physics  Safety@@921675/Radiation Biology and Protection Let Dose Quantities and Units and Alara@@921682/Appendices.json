It requires the derivation of conversion factors between SI and legacy CGS units for absorbed dose and equivalent dose, starting from fundamental definitions.\n\nFirst, we establish the conversion factor for absorbed dose.\nThe SI unit for absorbed dose ($D$) is the gray ($\\mathrm{Gy}$), which is defined from the fundamental relationship $D = \\mathrm{d}E/\\mathrm{d}m$ as the deposition of $1$ joule ($\\mathrm{J}$) of energy per kilogram ($\\mathrm{kg}$) of mass:\n$$1\\,\\mathrm{Gy} = 1\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{J}}{\\mathrm{kg}}$$\nThe legacy CGS unit for absorbed dose is the rad.

For the low-LET photon and electron radiations used in diagnostic imaging, the problem specifies $w_R=1$.\nThe SI unit for equivalent dose is the sievert ($\\mathrm{Sv}$).

For low-LET radiation, $Q=1$.\nSince $w_R=Q=1$ for the context of this problem, the numerical value of equivalent dose equals the numerical value of absorbed dose within each respective unit system.

The distinction between total stopping power and collision (electronic) stopping power, and the use of the latter to approximate LET, is a valid and common practice in dosimetry and radiobiology. The energy values for the particles and the corresponding stopping power values are physically realistic.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is clearly stated, providing all necessary definitions and data to derive the requested relationship, compute the intermediate values ($L_e$, $L_p$), and calculate the final ratio $R$. The instructions are unambiguous.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is presented in precise, technical language, free from subjective or biased statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe first step is to derive the relationship between Linear Energy Transfer ($L$) and mass stopping power ($S_m$).\nThe problem provides the definitions:\n$$L = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}E}{\\mathrm{d}x}$$\n$$S_{m} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}E}{\\mathrm{d}x}$$\nwhere $E$ is the energy of the particle, $x$ is the path length, and $\\rho$ is the density of the medium. The term $-\\mathrm{d}E/\\mathrm{d}x$ represents the energy lost by the particle per unit path length. This is also known as the linear stopping power, $S_l$. Thus, $L$ is conceptually equivalent to the linear stopping power for locally deposited energy.\n\nTo relate $L$ and $S_m$, we can rearrange the definition of mass stopping power:\n$$\\rho S_{m} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}E}{\\mathrm{d}x}$$\nBy substituting the definition of $L$ into this equation, we obtain the direct relationship:\n$$L = \\rho S_{m}$$\nThe problem specifies that for the purpose of LET calculation, only locally deposited energy is considered. For electrons, this means excluding energy lost to radiative processes (bremsstrahlung), as these photons can deposit their energy far from the particle track. Therefore, the relevant stopping power is the electronic (collision) stopping power, which accounts for local energy deposition through ionization and excitation. The given values for $S_m$ are explicitly stated to be electronic (collision) mass stopping powers, which makes this approximation consistent.\n\nNext, we compute the approximate LET values for the electrons ($L_e$) and protons ($L_p$) in water. The density of water is given as $\\rho = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$.\n\nFor the $6\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$ electrons:\nThe electronic mass stopping power is $S_{m,e} = 2.02\\,\\mathrm{MeV}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{g}$.\n$$L_{e} = \\rho S_{m,e} = (1.00\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{cm}^{3}) \\times (2.02\\,\\mathrm{MeV}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{g}) = 2.02\\,\\mathrm{MeV}/\\mathrm{cm}$$\n\nFor the $150\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$ protons:\nThe electronic mass stopping power is $S_{m,p} = 4.85\\,\\mathrm{MeV}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{g}$.\n$$L_{p} = \\rho S_{m,p} = (1.00\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{cm}^{3}) \\times (4.85\\,\\mathrm{MeV}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{g}) = 4.85\\,\\mathrm{MeV}/\\mathrm{cm}$$\n\nNow, we compute the dimensionless ratio $R = L_{p}/L_{e}$.\n$$R = \\frac{L_{p}}{L_{e}} = \\frac{4.85\\,\\mathrm{MeV}/\\mathrm{cm}}{2.02\\,\\mathrm{MeV}/\\mathrm{cm}} = \\frac{4.85}{2.02}$$\n$$R \\approx 2.400990099...$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested:\n$$R \\approx 2.40$$\n\nFinally, a brief explanation of the implications is required.\nThe calculated LET for the $150\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$ proton ($L_{p} = 4.85\\,\\mathrm{MeV}/\\mathrm{cm}$) is significantly higher than that for the $6\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$ electron ($L_{e} = 2.02\\,\\mathrm{MeV}/\\mathrm{cm}$). This classifies the proton beam as having a higher LET than the electron beam under these conditions.\n- **Track Structure and Biological Effect**: LET is a measure of the density of energy deposition along the particle's track. High-LET radiation, like the proton beam, deposits its energy very densely, creating a concentrated track of ionizations and excitations. Low-LET radiation, like the electron beam, deposits its energy more sparsely. This difference in microscopic energy deposition patterns has profound biological consequences. The dense ionization from high-LET radiation is more likely to cause complex and clustered DNA damage (such as multiple double-strand breaks in close proximity), which is difficult for cellular mechanisms to repair. This leads to a higher rate of cell killing, mutation, or carcinogenesis for the same amount of absorbed dose. This increased biological damage per unit dose is quantified by the Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE), which is generally higher for high-LET radiation.\n- **ALARA Principle**: The ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle is a cornerstone of radiation protection, aiming to minimize radiation doses. The biological risk from radiation exposure depends not only on the absorbed dose but also on the type and energy of the radiation, which is directly related to its LET. Since the proton beam has a higher LET and is therefore more biologically damaging per unit of absorbed dose than the electron beam, the ALARA principle requires the implementation of more stringent protective measures and controls to minimize exposure to the proton beam to achieve an equivalent level of risk mitigation. The \"Reasonably Achievable\" aspect implies that the protective efforts should be commensurate with the potential harm.\n\nThe final reported quantity is the ratio $R$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.40}$$", "id": "4915650"}]}
