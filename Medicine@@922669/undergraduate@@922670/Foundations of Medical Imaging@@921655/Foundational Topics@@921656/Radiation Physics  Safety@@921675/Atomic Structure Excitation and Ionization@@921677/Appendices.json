It presents a standard problem in atomic physics with direct applications to medical imaging technology. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and no contradictions or ambiguities are present.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the emission of characteristic X-rays is the conservation of energy. When an atom has a vacancy in an inner electronic shell, it is in an excited, high-energy state. It can de-excite by an electron from a higher-energy (less tightly bound) outer shell transitioning to fill the inner-shell vacancy. The excess energy is released as a photon. The energy of this emitted photon, $E_{\\text{photon}}$, is equal to the difference between the binding energy of the electron's initial shell (which corresponds to the shell with the vacancy) and the binding energy of the electron's final shell (the outer shell from which the electron originated). Let $E_{BE, \\text{inner}}$ be the binding energy of the inner shell with the vacancy and $E_{BE, \\text{outer}}$ be the binding energy of the outer shell supplying the electron. The photon energy is given by:\n$$E_{\\text{photon}} = E_{BE, \\text{inner}} - E_{BE, \\text{outer}}$$\nBinding energy is the energy required to remove an electron from a shell to infinity.
