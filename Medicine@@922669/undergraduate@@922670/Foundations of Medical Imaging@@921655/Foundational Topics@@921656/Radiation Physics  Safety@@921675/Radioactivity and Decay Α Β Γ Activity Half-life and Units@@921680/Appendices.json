An **extensive property** is a physical property of a system that is additive for subsystems; its value is proportional to the size or amount of material in the system. In contrast, an **intensive property** is a bulk property, meaning it is a physical property of a system that does not depend on the system size or the amount of material in the system.\n\nConsider the radioactive isotope Cobalt-60 ($^{60}$Co), which is used in medical radiotherapy and industrial radiography. A radiochemist has two pure samples of $^{60}$Co:\n*   Sample A has a mass of 2.0 grams.\n*   Sample B has a mass of 20.0 grams.\n\nThe chemist is interested in classifying two fundamental properties related to the radioactive nature of these samples:\n1.  **Half-life**: The time required for a quantity of a substance to reduce to half of its initial value through radioactive decay. The half-life of $^{60}$Co is a well-known constant.\n2.  **Total Radioactivity**: Also known as activity, this is the rate at which nuclei in the sample undergo decay. It is measured in units of Becquerels (Bq), where 1 Bq corresponds to one decay event per second.\n\nBased on the definitions of intensive and extensive properties, how should the half-life of $^{60}$Co and the total radioactivity of a specific sample be classified?\n\nA.

A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Law of Radioactive Decay**\nThe problem states that the per-nucleus hazard of decay, $\\lambda$, is constant. This means the probability of any given nucleus decaying in a small time interval $dt$ is $\\lambda dt$. For a large population of $N(t)$ independent radioactive nuclei at time $t$, the expected number of decays in $dt$ is the product of the number of nuclei and the probability of decay for a single nucleus. This change, $dN$, is a decrease, so we write:\n$$ dN = - (\\lambda dt) N(t) $$\nRearranging this gives the fundamental differential equation for radioactive decay:\n$$ \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -\\lambda N(t) $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We solve it by separation of variables, with the initial condition that at $t=0$, the number of nuclei is $N_0$.\n$$ \\frac{dN}{N} = -\\lambda dt $$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial state $(0, N_0)$ to a state $(t, N(t))$:\n$$ \\int_{N_0}^{N(t)} \\frac{1}{N'} dN' = \\int_0^t -\\lambda dt' $$\n$$ \\left[ \\ln(N') \\right]_{N_0}^{N(t)} = -\\lambda [t']_0^t $$\n$$ \\ln(N(t)) - \\ln(N_0) = -\\lambda t $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right) = -\\lambda t $$\nExponentiating both sides gives the law of radioactive decay for the number of nuclei as a function of time:\n$$ N(t) = N_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t) $$\n\n**Derivation of Activity, $A(t)$**\nActivity, $A(t)$, is defined as the expected number of decays per unit time. This is the absolute value of the rate of change of the number of radioactive nuclei:\n$$ A(t) = \\left| \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} \\right| $$\nFrom the differential equation, we have $\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -\\lambda N(t)$. Substituting this into the definition of activity:\n$$ A(t) = |-\\lambda N(t)| = \\lambda N(t) $$\n(since both $\\lambda$ and $N(t)$ are non-negative quantities).\nNow, we substitute the expression for $N(t)$:\n$$ A(t) = \\lambda (N_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t)) = (\\lambda N_0) \\exp(-\\lambda t) $$\nThe initial activity, $A_0$, is the activity at $t=0$:\n$$ A_0 = A(0) = \\lambda N_0 \\exp(-\\lambda \\cdot 0) = \\lambda N_0 $$\nThus, the activity as a function of time can also be written as:\n$$ A(t) = A_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t) $$\n\n**Justification of Units**\nThe decay constant $\\lambda$ is given in units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The number of nuclei $N_0$ is a dimensionless count (atoms). Therefore, the activity $A = \\lambda N$ has units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. In the context of radioactive decay, one decay per second is defined as one becquerel ($1\\ \\text{Bq} = 1\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$). The exponential term $\\exp(-\\lambda t)$ is dimensionless because its argument, $\\lambda t$, has units of $(\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{s})$, which cancel out. Thus, the unit of activity throughout the process is the becquerel (Bq), consistent with its physical definition.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\nWe are given:\n-   $N_0 = 2.60 \\times 10^{13}$\n-   $\\lambda = 3.21 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n-   $t = 2.50\\ \\text{hours}$\n\nFirst, we convert the time $t$ from hours to seconds to be consistent with the units of $\\lambda$:\n$$ t = 2.50\\ \\text{hours} \\times \\frac{3600\\ \\text{s}}{1\\ \\text{hour}} = 9000\\ \\text{s} $$\nNext, we calculate the initial activity, $A_0$, in becquerels. This is an intermediate step.\n$$ A_0 = \\lambda N_0 = (3.21 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (2.60 \\times 10^{13}) $$\n$$ A_0 = 8.346 \\times 10^8\\ \\text{Bq} $$\nNow we can calculate the activity at $t = 9000\\ \\text{s}$:\n$$ A(t=9000\\ \\text{s}) = A_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t) $$\nFirst, compute the dimensionless exponent:\n$$ \\lambda t = (3.21 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (9000\\ \\text{s}) = 0.2889 $$\nNow, substitute the values into the activity equation:\n$$ A(9000\\ \\text{s}) = (8.346 \\times 10^8\\ \\text{Bq}) \\times \\exp(-0.2889) $$\n$$ A(9000\\ \\text{s}) \\approx (8.346 \\times 10^8\\ \\text{Bq}) \\times 0.749090 $$\n$$ A(9000\\ \\text{s}) \\approx 6.251918 \\times 10^8\\ \\text{Bq} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in megabecquerels (MBq), where $1\\ \\text{MBq} = 10^6\\ \\text{Bq}$.\n$$ A(9000\\ \\text{s}) \\approx \\frac{6.251918 \\times 10^8\\ \\text{Bq}}{10^6\\ \\text{Bq/MBq}} \\approx 625.1918\\ \\text{MBq} $$\nFinally, we round the result to four significant figures as requested in the problem statement.\n$$ A(t=2.50\\ \\text{hours}) \\approx 625.2\\ \\text{MBq} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{625.2}$$", "id": "4915819"}, {"introduction": "Many important medical radionuclides are produced on-site using a generator system, which relies on a parent-daughter decay chain.
