It is based on standard principles of digital signal processing and medical image analysis. The provided information is sufficient to derive the required quantities and support a reasoned analysis. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution is presented in two parts as requested: first, the derivation of the change in Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and second, the reasoning about the impact on first-order radiomics statistics.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of SNR Change**\n\nThe Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is defined as the ratio of the signal power to the noise power. In decibels (dB), this is given by:\n$$\nSNR_{dB} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{P_{signal}}{P_{noise}}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that the signal, representing voxel intensities, is a wide-sense stationary process with zero mean and variance $\\sigma_{s}^{2}$. For a zero-mean signal, the signal power $P_{signal}$ is equal to its variance.\n$$\nP_{signal} = E[s^2] = \\text{Var}(s) + (E[s])^2 = \\sigma_{s}^{2} + 0^2 = \\sigma_{s}^{2}\n$$\nThis signal power is independent of the quantization process.\n\nThe noise is introduced by the uniform quantization process. For a uniform quantizer with a bit depth of $B$ bits over a dynamic range of width $R$, the number of quantization levels is $L = 2^B$. To be consistent with the definition in the main text, the quantization step size, $\\Delta$, which is the distance between adjacent quantization levels, is:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\frac{R}{L-1} = \\frac{R}{2^B-1}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a high-resolution quantization model, where the quantization error $q_e$ is a random variable uniformly distributed over the interval $[-\\frac{\\Delta}{2}, \\frac{\\Delta}{2}]$. The probability density function (PDF) of the error is:\n$$\nf(q_e) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{\\Delta} & \\text{if } -\\frac{\\Delta}{2} \\le q_e \\le \\frac{\\Delta}{2} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe noise is assumed to have zero mean, which is consistent with this symmetric distribution. The noise power, $P_{noise}$, is the variance of the quantization error, $\\sigma_q^2$, which for a zero-mean error is equal to the mean squared error.\n$$\nP_{noise} = \\sigma_q^2 = E[q_e^2] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} q_e^2 f(q_e) dq_e = \\int_{-\\Delta/2}^{\\Delta/2} q_e^2 \\frac{1}{\\Delta} dq_e\n$$\n$$\nP_{noise} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\left[ \\frac{q_e^3}{3} \\right]_{-\\Delta/2}^{\\Delta/2} = \\frac{1}{3\\Delta} \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2}\\right)^3 - \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta}{2}\\right)^3 \\right) = \\frac{1}{3\\Delta} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta^3}{8} + \\frac{\\Delta^3}{8} \\right) = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{12}\n$$\nNow, we can express the SNR as a function of the bit depth $B$:\n$$\nSNR(B) = \\frac{P_{signal}}{P_{noise}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{s}^{2}}{\\Delta^2/12} = \\frac{12\\sigma_{s}^{2}}{(R/(2^B-1))^2} = \\frac{12\\sigma_{s}^{2}(2^B-1)^2}{R^2}\n$$\nWe are asked for the change in SNR in dB when moving from an initial bit depth $B_1 = 16$ to a final bit depth $B_2 = 12$. The change, $\\Delta SNR_{dB}$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta SNR_{dB} = SNR_{dB}(B_2) - SNR_{dB}(B_1) = 10 \\log_{10}(SNR(B_2)) - 10 \\log_{10}(SNR(B_1))\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta SNR_{dB} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{SNR(B_2)}{SNR(B_1)}\\right)\n$$\nThe ratio of the SNRs is:\n$$\n\\frac{SNR(B_2)}{SNR(B_1)} = \\frac{\\frac{12\\sigma_{s}^{2}}{R^2} (2^{B_2}-1)^2}{\\frac{12\\sigma_{s}^{2}}{R^2} (2^{B_1}-1)^2} = \\left(\\frac{2^{B_2}-1}{2^{B_1}-1}\\right)^2\n$$\nSubstituting $B_1 = 16$ and $B_2 = 12$:\n$$\n\\frac{SNR(12)}{SNR(16)} = \\left(\\frac{2^{12}-1}{2^{16}-1}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{4095}{65535}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe change in SNR in dB is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta SNR_{dB} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\left(\\frac{4095}{65535}\\right)^2\\right) = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{4095}{65535}\\right)\n$$\nUsing a calculator, $\\frac{4095}{65535} \\approx 0.062517$:\n$$\n\\Delta SNR_{dB} \\approx 20 \\log_{10}(0.062517) \\approx -24.08\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the change in SNR is $-24.1$ dB.\n\n**Part 2: Impact on First-Order Radiomics Statistics**\n\nLet the true, continuous voxel intensity be $X$ and the quantized intensity be $Y$. From the problem statement, we can model the quantized signal as $Y = X + \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is the quantization error. The error $\\epsilon$ is assumed to be independent of $X$ with $E[\\epsilon]=0$ and $\\text{Var}(\\epsilon) = \\sigma_q^2 = \\Delta^2/12$. The requantization from $B_1=16$ bits to $B_2=12$ bits implies a significant increase in the quantization step size ($\\Delta_2 = (2^{16}-1)/(2^{12}-1)\\Delta_1 \\approx 16\\Delta_1$) and thus a large increase in noise power ($\\sigma_{q2}^2 \\approx (16)^2 \\sigma_{q1}^2 = 256\\sigma_{q1}^2$). We analyze the impact on first-order statistics computed from a sample of $N$ voxels.\n\n1.  **Sample Mean ($\\bar{Y}$)**: The sample mean of the quantized signal is $\\bar{Y} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum(X_i + \\epsilon_i) = \\bar{X} + \\bar{\\epsilon}$.\n    *   **Bias**: The expected value is $E[\\bar{Y}] = E[\\bar{X}] + E[\\bar{\\epsilon}] = \\mu_X$. Since $E[\\epsilon_i]=0$ for all $i$, the sample mean remains an unbiased estimator of the true signal mean. Bit-depth reduction does not introduce a bias in the sample mean.\n    *   **Variability**: The variance of the sample mean is $\\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}) = \\text{Var}(\\bar{X}) + \\text{Var}(\\bar{\\epsilon}) = \\frac{\\sigma_s^2}{N} + \\frac{\\sigma_q^2}{N}$. Since $\\sigma_{q2}^2 > \\sigma_{q1}^2$, the variance of the sample mean is higher for the $12$-bit image. The estimate is less stable.\n\n2.  **Sample Variance ($s_Y^2$)**: The variance of the quantized signal is $\\sigma_Y^2 = \\text{Var}(X+\\epsilon) = \\text{Var}(X) + \\text{Var}(\\epsilon) = \\sigma_s^2 + \\sigma_q^2$, due to independence.\n    *   **Bias**: The sample variance $s_Y^2$ is an unbiased estimator of $\\sigma_Y^2$, not $\\sigma_s^2$. Its expectation is $E[s_Y^2] = \\sigma_s^2 + \\sigma_q^2$. It is therefore a biased estimator of the true signal variance, with a positive bias of $\\sigma_q^2$. This bias is substantially larger for the $12$-bit image ($\\sigma_{q2}^2$) than for the $16$-bit image ($\\sigma_{q1}^2$).\n    *   **Variability**: The variability of the $s_Y^2$ estimator depends on the higher-order moments of $Y$. As the variance of $Y$ increases with lower bit depth, the variability of its sample variance estimate is also expected to increase.\n\n3.  **Energy ($\\sum Y^2$)**: The energy is the sum of squared voxel intensities.\n    *   **Bias**: The expected energy is $E[\\sum Y_i^2] = \\sum E[(X_i+\\epsilon_i)^2] = \\sum(E[X_i^2] + 2E[X_i]E[\\epsilon_i] + E[\\epsilon_i^2])$. With $E[X_i]=0$ and $E[\\epsilon_i]=0$, this simplifies to $\\sum(\\sigma_s^2 + \\sigma_q^2) = N(\\sigma_s^2 + \\sigma_q^2)$. The energy is biased upward by $N\\sigma_q^2$. This positive bias is significantly larger for the $12$-bit image.\n\n4.  **Shannon Entropy ($H$)**: Entropy is computed from the discrete voxel intensity histogram, $H = -\\sum p_k \\log p_k$.\n    *   **Bias**: Reducing the bit depth from $16$ to $12$ reduces the number of possible intensity levels from $2^{16}$ to $2^{12}$. This coarsens the intensity histogram, mapping multiple finer bins into single coarser bins. This process is a form of data processing which, by the data processing inequality, reduces information. The number of non-empty bins decreases, and their probabilities $p_k$ tend to increase. This almost invariably leads to a lower computed entropy value. The entropy estimate is biased downwards, and this bias is substantially more pronounced for the lower-bit-depth $12$-bit representation.\n    *   **Variability**: While more biased, an entropy estimate from a coarser histogram (fewer bins, more counts per bin) is often more robust to sampling noise, meaning it can have lower variability. This represents a classic bias-variance trade-off.\n\n5.  **Skewness**: Skewness measures the asymmetry of the distribution. The skewness of $Y$ is $\\gamma_1(Y) = E[((Y-\\mu_Y)/\\sigma_Y)^3]$.\n    *   **Bias**: Because the quantization error $\\epsilon$ has a symmetric distribution ($E[\\epsilon^3]=0$) and is independent of the signal $X$, the third central moment is preserved: $E[(Y-\\mu_Y)^3] = E[(X-\\mu_X)^3]$. However, the variance is increased: $\\sigma_Y^2 = \\sigma_s^2 + \\sigma_q^2$. Thus, the skewness of the quantized signal is $\\gamma_1(Y) = \\gamma_1(X) (\\frac{\\sigma_s^2}{\\sigma_s^2+\\sigma_q^2})^{3/2}$. The measured skewness is biased towards zero, meaning the distribution appears more symmetric. Since $\\sigma_q^2$ is much larger for the $12$-bit case, this attenuation of skewness is far more severe.\n\n6.  **Kurtosis**: Kurtosis measures the \"tailedness\" of the distribution.\n    *   **Bias**: The uniform distribution of the quantization error $\\epsilon$ is platykurtic (its excess kurtosis is $-1.2$). Convolving the signal's distribution with this error distribution pulls the resulting kurtosis towards that of the uniform noise. The fourth central moment of $Y$ is $E[(Y-\\mu_Y)^4] = E[(X-\\mu_X)^4] + 6\\sigma_s^2\\sigma_q^2 + E[\\epsilon^4]$. The kurtosis of $Y$ becomes a complex mixture of the signal and noise kurtosis. The effect is a bias in the measured kurtosis, and this bias is much stronger for the $12$-bit image due to its substantially larger $\\sigma_q^2$. The kurtosis of the $12$-bit image will be more heavily influenced by the platykurtic nature of the quantization noise.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-24.1}\n$$", "id": "4536956"}, {"introduction": "In clinical practice, the numbers stored in a digital image file are rarely used directly; they are calibrated to represent physical quantities.

The concepts of Hounsfield Units (HU), bit depth, quantization, rescale slope, and rescale intercept are fundamental and accurately represented concepts in computed tomography (CT). The numerical values provided for the original calibration ($s=1$, $b=-1024$) are standard, and the HU window of interest ($[-1000, 3000]$) is clinically realistic for encompassing tissues from air to dense bone.

There are no identifiable flaws. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Problem Solution**\n\nThe re-quantization process involves defining a new linear relationship between the $10$-bit integer codes, $I_{10}$, and the physical values in Hounsfield Units, $HU$. This relationship is given by the equation:\n$$HU = s' \\cdot I_{10} + b'$$\nwhere $s'$ is the new rescale slope and $b'$ is the new rescale intercept.\n\nThe problem specifies that the range of clinically relevant HU values, $[L, U]$, must map exactly to the full range of the new $10$-bit integer codes, $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 1023\\}$. This provides two specific points on the line defined by the calibration equation:\n1.  The minimum integer code, $I_{10,min} = 0$, maps to the lower bound of the HU window, $L = -1000$ HU.\n2.  The maximum integer code, $I_{10,max} = 1023$, maps to the upper bound of the HU window, $U = 3000$ HU.\n\nWe can express these two conditions as a system of two linear equations:\n1.  For the point $(I_{10}, HU) = (0, -1000)$:\n    $$-1000 = s' \\cdot 0 + b'$$\n2.  For the point $(I_{10}, HU) = (1023, 3000)$:\n    $$3000 = s' \\cdot 1023 + b'$$\n\nFrom the first equation, we can immediately determine the new rescale intercept, $b' = -1000$ HU.\n\nThe rescale slope, $s'$, represents the change in HU for each single-unit increment of the integer code $I_{10}$. It is, by definition, the slope of the line. The slope of a line passing through two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the formula $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. In our context, $y$ corresponds to $HU$ and $x$ corresponds to $I_{10}$.\n\nUsing the two specified mapping points, $(I_{10,min}, L)$ and $(I_{10,max}, U)$, we can calculate $s'$:\n$$s' = \\frac{\\Delta HU}{\\Delta I_{10}} = \\frac{U - L}{I_{10,max} - I_{10,min}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$L = -1000 \\, \\mathrm{HU}$$\n$$U = 3000 \\, \\mathrm{HU}$$\n$$I_{10,min} = 0$$\n$$I_{10,max} = 1023$$\n\nThe calculation for $s'$ is as follows:\n$$s' = \\frac{3000 - (-1000)}{1023 - 0} = \\frac{3000 + 1000}{1023} = \\frac{4000}{1023}$$\n\nThe problem requires a final numerical answer rounded to four significant figures.

The fifth significant digit is $0$. Therefore, we do not round up the fourth significant digit. The resulting value is $3.910$.\n\nThe units of the slope are the units of the vertical axis (HU) divided by the units of the horizontal axis (levels or integer code increments), so the units are HU per level.\n\nThus, the new rescale slope is $s' \\approx 3.910$ HU per level.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.910}\n$$", "id": "4878156"}, {"introduction": "The noise visible in a medical image is rarely from a single source; it is the cumulative result of physical processes during data acquisition and digital processes during image formation.

The variance of this estimator, $\\sigma^2_{\\hat{\\mu}}$, is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma^2_{\\hat{\\mu}} = \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\mu}) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{p}}{L}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property of variance $\\text{Var}(cX) = c^2\\text{Var}(X)$, where $c$ is a constant, we have:\n$$\n\\sigma^2_{\\hat{\\mu}} = \\frac{1}{L^2} \\text{Var}(\\tilde{p})\n$$\nThe quantized projection $\\tilde{p}$ is subject to two sources of noise: quantum noise from photon statistics and quantization noise. The problem states that these two noise sources are statistically independent. Therefore, the total variance of $\\tilde{p}$ is the sum of the individual variances:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\tilde{p}) = \\sigma_p^2 + \\sigma_q^2\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_p^2$ is the variance due to photon statistics and $\\sigma_q^2$ is the variance due to quantization.

The mean number of detected photons, $\\bar{N}$, is given by the Beer-Lambert law:\n$$\n\\bar{N} = N_0 \\exp(-\\mu L)\n$$\nwhere $N_0$ is the mean number of incident photons (air counts).
