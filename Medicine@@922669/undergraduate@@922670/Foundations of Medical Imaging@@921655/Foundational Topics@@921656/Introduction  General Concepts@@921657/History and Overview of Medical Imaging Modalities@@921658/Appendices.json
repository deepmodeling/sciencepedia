The solution will be constructed step-by-step from the foundational facts provided.\n\nFirst, we establish the maximum possible pulse repetition frequency, $f_{PRF, max}$, that avoids range ambiguity. The problem states that a new pulse cannot be transmitted until echoes from the maximum imaging depth, $R_{\\max}$, have returned. The round-trip time, $T_{round-trip}$, for an echo from this depth is given by the first principle:\n$$T_{round-trip} = \\frac{2 R_{\\max}}{c}$$\nTo avoid range ambiguity, the time between consecutive pulses, known as the pulse repetition period ($T_{PRF}$), must be at least this long.\n$$T_{PRF} \\ge T_{round-trip} = \\frac{2 R_{\\max}}{c}$$\nThe pulse repetition frequency, $f_{PRF}$, is the inverse of the pulse repetition period, $f_{PRF} = 1/T_{PRF}$. Therefore, the constraint on the period implies a constraint on the frequency:\n$$f_{PRF} = \\frac{1}{T_{PRF}} \\le \\frac{1}{\\frac{2 R_{\\max}}{c}} = \\frac{c}{2 R_{\\max}}$$\nThe problem specifies that the pulse repetition frequency is set as high as possible without introducing range ambiguity.

The third principle, based on the Nyquist sampling theorem, states that to avoid aliasing, the magnitude of the measured Doppler frequency shift, $|f_{D}|$, must be strictly less than one-half the sampling frequency. In pulsed-wave Doppler, the sampling frequency is the pulse repetition frequency, $f_{PRF}$.\n$$|f_{D}| < \\frac{f_{PRF}}{2}$$\nThe maximum unaliased Doppler frequency, $|f_{D, max}|$, corresponds to the limit of this condition. Thus, we have:\n$$|f_{D, max}| = \\frac{f_{PRF}}{2}$$\nSince the system is operated at its maximum possible $f_{PRF}$ to maximize the velocity measurement range before aliasing occurs, we use $f_{PRF, max}$:\n$$|f_{D, max}| = \\frac{f_{PRF, max}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{c}{2 R_{\\max}} \\right) = \\frac{c}{4 R_{\\max}}$$\nThis equation links the maximum measurable Doppler shift directly to the speed of sound and the maximum imaging depth.\n\nThird, we use the fourth principle provided, which gives the Doppler frequency shift, $f_{D}$, as a function of the blood velocity, $v$. The formula for the two-way Doppler shift is:\n$$f_{D} = \\frac{2 v f_{0} \\cos \\theta}{c}$$\nwhere $v$ is the speed of the blood flow, $f_{0}$ is the ultrasound center frequency, $\\theta$ is the angle between the ultrasound beam and the flow direction, and $c$ is the speed of sound.
