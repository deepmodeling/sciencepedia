Derivation of Voxel Dimensions**\n\nThe spatial resolution of a digital image is determined by the size of its fundamental element, the voxel. For a rectangular field of view $FOV_x \\times FOV_y$ that is sampled by a discrete matrix of size $N_x \\times N_y$, the in-plane dimensions of each voxel, $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$, are found by dividing the total extent of the FOV in each direction by the number of samples in that direction. This assumes uniform sampling.\n\nThe algebraic expression for the voxel dimension in the $x$-direction is:\n$$ \\Delta x = \\frac{FOV_x}{N_x} $$\nSimilarly, the algebraic expression for the voxel dimension in the $y$-direction is:\n$$ \\Delta y = \\frac{FOV_y}{N_y} $$\nThe voxel dimension in the $z$-direction, the slice thickness, is given directly as $\\Delta z$.\n\n**2. Derivation of Nyquist Spatial Frequencies**\n\nThe Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem dictates the relationship between the sampling interval and the maximum spatial frequency that can be represented without aliasing. According to the theorem, for a given sampling interval $\\Delta s$, the Nyquist frequency $f_N$ is the highest frequency that can be faithfully captured. It is defined as half of the sampling frequency. Since the sampling frequency in the spatial domain is the reciprocal of the sampling interval, $f_s = 1/\\Delta s$, the Nyquist frequency is:\n$$ f_N = \\frac{f_s}{2} = \\frac{1}{2 \\Delta s} $$\nApplying this first principle to our specific problem, the Nyquist spatial frequency in the $x$-direction, $f_{Nx}$, is determined by the sampling interval $\\Delta x$:\n$$ f_{Nx} = \\frac{1}{2 \\Delta x} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta x$ from above, we can also express $f_{Nx}$ in terms of the primary acquisition parameters:\n$$ f_{Nx} = \\frac{1}{2 \\left(\\frac{FOV_x}{N_x}\\right)} = \\frac{N_x}{2 FOV_x} $$\nSimilarly, the Nyquist spatial frequency in the $y$-direction, $f_{Ny}$, is determined by the sampling interval $\\Delta y$:\n$$ f_{Ny} = \\frac{1}{2 \\Delta y} = \\frac{N_y}{2 FOV_y} $$\n\n**3. Numerical Computations**\n\nThe numerical values are now computed using the given parameters and rounding to four significant figures as required.\n\nThe voxel dimensions are:\n$$ \\Delta x = \\frac{350\\,\\text{mm}}{256} = 1.3671875\\,\\text{mm} \\approx 1.367\\,\\text{mm} $$\n$$ \\Delta y = \\frac{280\\,\\text{mm}}{224} = 1.25\\,\\text{mm} = 1.250\\,\\text{mm} $$\nThe value for $\\Delta y$ is exact, so it is written with four significant figures by adding trailing zeros. The slice thickness $\\Delta z$ is given as $1.5\\,\\text{mm}$, which to four significant figures is $1.500\\,\\text{mm}$.\n\nThe Nyquist spatial frequencies are:\nIt is best practice to use the expressions involving the primary parameters to avoid propagating rounding errors.\n$$ f_{Nx} = \\frac{N_x}{2 FOV_x} = \\frac{256}{2 \\times 350\\,\\text{mm}} = \\frac{256}{700}\\,\\text{mm}^{-1} = 0.365714...\\,\\text{mm}^{-1} \\approx 0.3657\\,\\text{mm}^{-1} $$\n$$ f_{Ny} = \\frac{N_y}{2 FOV_y} = \\frac{224}{2 \\times 280\\,\\text{mm}} = \\frac{224}{560}\\,\\text{mm}^{-1} = 0.4\\,\\text{mm}^{-1} = 0.4000\\,\\text{mm}^{-1} $$\nThe value for $f_{Ny}$ is exact, so it is written with four significant figures.\n\nThe final set of computed values, in the required order $(\\Delta x, \\Delta y, \\Delta z, f_{Nx}, f_{Ny})$ and rounded to four significant figures, is $(1.367\\,\\text{mm}, 1.250\\,\\text{mm}, 1.500\\,\\text{mm}, 0.3657\\,\\text{mm}^{-1}, 0.4000\\,\\text{mm}^{-1})$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1.367 & 1.250 & 1.500 & 0.3657 & 0.4000 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4892494"}, {"introduction": "After establishing how to determine an imaging system's Nyquist frequency, a crucial question arises: what happens when the object being imaged contains details finer than this limit?

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires an analysis of the sampling process of a continuous spatial signal by a digital detector. The core principle governing this process is the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling theorem.\n\nThe detector samples the continuous image with a spatial interval equal to the pixel pitch, $p$. This sampling interval in one dimension is $\\Delta x = p = 0.25$ mm.\n\nThe spatial sampling frequency, $f_s$, is the reciprocal of the sampling interval:\n$$\nf_s = \\frac{1}{p}\n$$\nSubstituting the given value for $p$:\n$$\nf_s = \\frac{1}{0.25 \\text{ mm}} = 4 \\text{ mm}^{-1}\n$$\nThis sampling rate of $4$ samples per millimeter corresponds to a cyclic sampling frequency of $4$ cycles per millimeter, or $4$ lp/mm, as one full cycle (a line pair) can be reconstructed from its samples.\n\nAccording to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, to perfectly reconstruct a band-limited signal, the sampling frequency $f_s$ must be strictly greater than twice the highest frequency component of the signal, $f_{\\text{max}}$. In this case, the signal is a single sinusoid with frequency $f$, so $f_{\\text{max}} = f$. The critical frequency, known as the Nyquist frequency $f_N$, is defined as half the sampling frequency:\n$$\nf_N = \\frac{f_s}{2} = \\frac{1}{2p}\n$$\nThe Nyquist frequency represents the maximum signal frequency that can be sampled without introducing aliasing distortion.\nCalculating $f_N$ for the given detector:\n$$\nf_N = \\frac{4 \\text{ lp/mm}}{2} = 2 \\text{ lp/mm}\n$$\n\nAliasing occurs when the frequency of the input signal, $f$, exceeds the Nyquist frequency, $f_N$. We compare the given signal frequency with the calculated Nyquist frequency:\n-   Signal frequency: $f = 3$ lp/mm\n-   Nyquist frequency: $f_N = 2$ lp/mm\n\nSince $f > f_N$ (specifically, $3 > 2$), the sampling condition is violated, and aliasing occurs. Therefore, the binary indicator for aliasing is $A=1$.\n\nWhen aliasing occurs, the sampled signal appears to have a lower frequency than the original signal. This apparent frequency, $f_{\\text{alias}}$, is a result of the spectral replication inherent in the sampling process. Sampling in the spatial domain (multiplication by a Dirac comb) corresponds to convolution in the frequency domain, which creates copies of the original signal's spectrum centered at integer multiples of the sampling frequency, $n \\cdot f_s$, where $n$ is an integer.\n\nAn observer of the sampled data can only perceive frequencies within the baseband, which extends from $0$ to the Nyquist frequency $f_N$. The aliased frequency $f_{\\text{alias}}$ is the frequency within this baseband that corresponds to the original, higher frequency $f$. It can be calculated by \"folding\" the original frequency back into the baseband. The general formula for the aliased frequency is:\n$$\nf_{\\text{alias}} = |f - n \\cdot f_s|\n$$\nwhere the integer $n$ is chosen such that $f_{\\text{alias}} \\le f_N$.\n\nFor our problem, $f = 3$ lp/mm and $f_s = 4$ lp/mm. We seek an integer $n$ that brings the result into the range $[0, 2]$. Choosing $n=1$:\n$$\nf_{\\text{alias}} = |3 \\text{ lp/mm} - 1 \\cdot (4 \\text{ lp/mm})| = |-1 \\text{ lp/mm}| = 1 \\text{ lp/mm}\n$$\nThis result, $f_{\\text{alias}} = 1$ lp/mm, lies within the detectable range $[0, f_N]$, since $1 \\le 2$. Thus, the sinusoidal pattern with an actual frequency of $3$ lp/mm will appear in the sampled image as a pattern with a frequency of $1$ lp/mm.\n\nIn summary:\n1.  Aliasing occurs because the signal frequency ($3$ lp/mm) is greater than the Nyquist frequency ($2$ lp/mm). Thus, $A=1$.\n2.  The aliased frequency observed in the image is $f_{\\text{alias}} = 1$ lp/mm.\n\nThe final answer is to be provided as a row matrix $(A, f_{\\text{alias}})$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1\\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4892473"}, {"introduction": "Image quality is not solely defined by spatial detail; the ability to capture changes over time is equally critical, especially in dynamic studies like fluoroscopy or cardiac imaging.

It is a standard problem in linear systems theory as applied to medical imaging detectors. All necessary information is provided, and the premises are consistent with established principles of physics and signal processing.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part solution: first, to derive the temporal Modulation Transfer Function ($MTF_t$) for a detector with a rectangular integration window, and second, to calculate the signal attenuation for a specific input frequency and exposure time.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Temporal Modulation Transfer Function ($MTF_t$)**\n\nThe detector is described as a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system. The behavior of such a system is completely characterized by its impulse response, which the problem statement defines as the temporal point spread function, $h(t)$.\n\nThe problem states that $h(t)$ is a normalized, uniform integration window of duration $T$. This corresponds to a rectangular pulse. We define the function to be non-zero over the interval $[0, T]$. For it to be a \"normalized\" integration window, its integral over all time must be unity, which ensures that a constant, unit-level input signal results in a unit-level output.\nThe unnormalized function is constant, say $A$, over $[0, T]$. Its integral is $\\int_{0}^{T} A \\, dt = A \\cdot T$.\nFor normalization, we set this integral to $1$: $A \\cdot T = 1$, which implies $A = \\frac{1}{T}$.\nThus, the impulse response $h(t)$ is:\n$$\nh(t) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{T} & \\text{for } 0 \\le t \\le T \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe frequency response of an LTI system, denoted $H(f_t)$, is the Fourier transform of its impulse response $h(t)$.

The exponential term $\\lim_{f_t \\to 0} e^{-i \\pi f_t T} = e^0 = 1$.\nSo, $H(0) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\nAlternatively, from the integral definition, $H(0) = \\int_0^T \\frac{1}{T} dt = \\frac{1}{T} [t]_0^T = \\frac{T}{T} = 1$.\n\nThe normalization factor is $|H(0)| = |1| = 1$. Therefore, the $MTF_t$ is simply the magnitude of the frequency response:\n$$\nMTF_t(f_t) = \\frac{|H(f_t)|}{|H(0)|} = \\frac{|\\text{sinc}(f_t T)|}{1} = |\\text{sinc}(f_t T)|\n$$\nSo, the derived temporal Modulation Transfer Function is $MTF_t(f_t) = \\left| \\frac{\\sin(\\pi f_t T)}{\\pi f_t T} \\right|$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Attenuation Factor**\n\nThe problem asks for the attenuation factor for a sinusoidal input at frequency $f_t = 2$ Hz with an exposure duration $T = 100$ ms. The attenuation factor for a given frequency is the value of the $MTF_t$ at that frequency.\n\nFirst, we must ensure consistent units.
