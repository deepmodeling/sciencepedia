It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and quantitatively solvable.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe first step is to derive the theoretical relationship between the mean signal $\\mu_{y}$ and the signal variance $\\sigma^{2}_{y}$. The detector output signal $y$ for a single pixel is given by the linear model:\n$$y = \\alpha (n + r_{e})$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of photoelectrons (a Poisson random variable) and $r_{e}$ is the read noise in electrons (a zero-mean Gaussian random variable). We are given that $n$ and $r_{e}$ are independent.\n\nThe mean signal in ADU, $\\mu_{y}$, is the expected value of $y$:\n$$\\mu_{y} = E[y] = E[\\alpha (n + r_{e})]$$\nBy the linearity of the expectation operator:\n$$\\mu_{y} = \\alpha (E[n] + E[r_{e}])$$\nLet $\\mu_{n} = E[n]$ be the mean number of photoelectrons. The problem states that $r_{e}$ is a zero-mean random variable, so $E[r_{e}] = 0$. Therefore, the mean signal is:\n$$\\mu_{y} = \\alpha \\mu_{n}$$\n\nThe variance of the signal in $\\text{ADU}^{2}$, $\\sigma^{2}_{y}$, is the variance of $y$:\n$$\\sigma^{2}_{y} = \\text{Var}(y) = \\text{Var}(\\alpha (n + r_{e}))$$\nUsing the property $\\text{Var}(cX) = c^2 \\text{Var}(X)$:\n$$\\sigma^{2}_{y} = \\alpha^{2} \\text{Var}(n + r_{e})$$\nSince $n$ and $r_{e}$ are independent, the variance of their sum is the sum of their variances:\n$$\\sigma^{2}_{y} = \\alpha^{2} (\\text{Var}(n) + \\text{Var}(r_{e}))$$\nFor a Poisson random variable, the variance is equal to its mean, so $\\text{Var}(n) = \\mu_{n}$. The variance of the read noise is, by definition, $\\text{Var}(r_{e}) = \\sigma_{r,e}^{2}$. Substituting these into the equation gives:\n$$\\sigma^{2}_{y} = \\alpha^{2} (\\mu_{n} + \\sigma_{r,e}^{2})$$\n\nTo find the relationship between $\\sigma^{2}_{y}$ and $\\mu_{y}$, we must eliminate $\\mu_{n}$. From the expression for the mean signal, we have $\\mu_{n} = \\mu_{y} / \\alpha$. Substituting this into the variance equation:\n$$\\sigma^{2}_{y} = \\alpha^{2} \\left(\\frac{\\mu_{y}}{\\alpha} + \\sigma_{r,e}^{2}\\right)$$\nDistributing the $\\alpha^{2}$ term yields the Photon Transfer Curve equation:\n$$\\sigma^{2}_{y} = \\alpha \\mu_{y} + \\alpha^{2} \\sigma_{r,e}^{2}$$\nThis equation is in the form of a straight line, $Y = mX + c$, where $Y = \\sigma^{2}_{y}$ and $X = \\mu_{y}$.\n\nFrom this relationship, we can identify the slope and the y-intercept of the PTC:\n- The slope is $m = \\alpha$.\n- The y-intercept is $c = \\alpha^{2} \\sigma_{r,e}^{2}$.\n\nNext, we perform an unweighted linear fit to the provided data points $(\\mu_{y}, \\sigma^{2}_{y})$. The data points are:\n- $(100, 64.41)$\n- $(500, 304.41)$\n- $(1000, 604.41)$\n- $(2000, 1204.41)$\n- $(3000, 1804.41)$\n\nA close inspection reveals that these data points lie perfectly on a straight line. We can compute the slope $m$ using any two points. For instance, using the first two points:\n$$m = \\frac{\\Delta \\sigma^{2}_{y}}{\\Delta \\mu_{y}} = \\frac{304.41 - 64.41}{500 - 100} = \\frac{240}{400} = 0.6$$\nWe can verify this with another pair of points, say the last two:\n$$m = \\frac{1804.41 - 1204.41}{3000 - 2000} = \\frac{600}{1000} = 0.6$$\nThe slope is exactly $m = 0.6$. Since the points are perfectly collinear, a formal least-squares regression is unnecessary and would yield the same result.\n\nNow, we can find the y-intercept $c$ using the equation $c = \\sigma^{2}_{y} - m \\mu_{y}$ with any data point. Using the first point:\n$$c = 64.41 - (0.6)(100) = 64.41 - 60 = 4.41$$\nThe linear relationship is therefore $\\sigma^{2}_{y} = 0.6 \\mu_{y} + 4.41$.\n\nWe can now determine the physical parameters. The conversion proportionality $\\alpha$ is equal to the slope:\n$$\\alpha = m = 0.6 \\text{ ADU/electron}$$\nThe problem asks for the conversion gain $G$, which is the reciprocal of $\\alpha$:\n$$G = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{0.6} = \\frac{1}{6/10} = \\frac{10}{6} = \\frac{5}{3} \\approx 1.666... \\text{ electrons/ADU}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $G \\approx 1.67$ electrons/ADU.\n\nThe read noise $\\sigma_{r,e}$ is found from the y-intercept $c$:\n$$c = \\alpha^{2} \\sigma_{r,e}^{2} = 4.41$$\nSolving for $\\sigma_{r,e}^{2}$:\n$$\\sigma_{r,e}^{2} = \\frac{c}{\\alpha^{2}} = \\frac{4.41}{(0.6)^{2}} = \\frac{4.41}{0.36} = 12.25$$\nTaking the square root to find the read noise standard deviation:\n$$\\sigma_{r,e} = \\sqrt{12.25} = 3.5 \\text{ electrons}$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $\\sigma_{r,e} = 3.50$ electrons.\n\nThe final results are a conversion gain $G \\approx 1.67$ electrons/ADU and a read noise $\\sigma_{r,e} = 3.50$ electrons.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.67 & 3.50\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4915302"}, {"introduction": "An imaging detector's behavior is typically governed by one of two noise sources: constant electronic read noise at low light levels, or signal-dependent quantum shot noise at higher light levels.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe total noise in an imaging system often comprises multiple independent sources. In this case, two are specified: quantum noise (also known as photon shot noise) and electronic read noise. To determine the crossover point between the regimes dominated by each, we must first express both noise sources in the same units and then set them equal. The most convenient unit for this comparison is the number of electrons at the pixel (input-referred noise).\n\nLet $\\bar{N}$ be the mean number of photoelectrons collected by the pixel.\n\n**1. Quantum (Shot) Noise:**\nThe generation of photoelectrons is a random process governed by Poisson statistics. A fundamental property of a Poisson distribution is that its variance is equal to its mean. If the mean number of photoelectrons is $\\bar{N}$, the variance in the number of photoelectrons is $\\sigma_N^2 = \\bar{N}$. The quantum noise, defined as the standard deviation of the number of electrons, is therefore:\n$$\n\\sigma_{shot} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_N^2} = \\sqrt{\\bar{N}}\n$$\nThis noise is expressed in units of electrons ($\\mathrm{e}^{-}$). The magnitude of the shot noise increases with the square root of the signal level ($\\bar{N}$).\n\n**2. Electronic Read Noise:**\nThe electronic read noise is given as a root-mean-square (RMS) voltage at the amplifier output, $\\sigma_v$. To compare it with the shot noise, we must refer it back to the input of the amplification chain, i.e., express it as an equivalent number of noise electrons. The conversion gain, $g$, provides the linear mapping from the number of electrons, $N$, to the output voltage, $V$:\n$$\nV = g \\cdot N\n$$\nTherefore, a noise fluctuation in voltage, $\\sigma_v$, can be mapped to an equivalent fluctuation in the number of electrons, $\\sigma_{read}$, by dividing by the conversion gain:\n$$\n\\sigma_{read} = \\frac{\\sigma_v}{g}\n$$\nThis read noise, expressed in electrons, is independent of the signal level $\\bar{N}$.\n\n**3. Qualitative Explanation of Regimes:**\nAt very low signal levels (small $\\bar{N}$), the shot noise $\\sigma_{shot} = \\sqrt{\\bar{N}}$ is very small. In this regime, the constant electronic read noise, $\\sigma_{read}$, dominates the total noise. This is the **read-noise-dominated** regime. As the signal level $\\bar{N}$ increases, the shot noise $\\sqrt{\\bar{N}}$ grows. Eventually, it becomes significantly larger than the constant $\\sigma_{read}$. This is the **shot-noise-dominated** (or quantum-noise-dominated) regime. The imaging system is said to be \"quantum-limited\" when this condition holds, as the noise is fundamentally limited by the statistics of the detected photons rather than the electronics.\n\n**4. Crossover Condition and Calculation:**\nThe crossover between the two regimes is defined as the signal level, let's call it $\\bar{N}_{crossover}$, at which the magnitudes of the two noise sources are equal:\n$$\n\\sigma_{shot} = \\sigma_{read}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for each noise source:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\bar{N}_{crossover}} = \\frac{\\sigma_v}{g}\n$$\nTo find the electron count at this crossover, we square both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\bar{N}_{crossover} = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_v}{g}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values. It is critical to ensure the units are consistent.\nThe conversion gain is $g = 60 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{V}/\\mathrm{e}^{-} = 60 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{V}/\\mathrm{e}^{-}$.\nThe RMS read noise voltage is $\\sigma_v = 1.5 \\ \\mathrm{mV} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the input-referred read noise in electrons:\n$$\n\\sigma_{read} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{V}}{60 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{V}/\\mathrm{e}^{-}} = \\frac{1.5}{60} \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{e}^{-} = 0.025 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{e}^{-} = 25 \\ \\mathrm{e}^{-}\n$$\nThe electronic read noise is equivalent to a fluctuation of $25$ electrons at the input.\n\nNow, we can find the crossover electron count:\n$$\n\\bar{N}_{crossover} = (\\sigma_{read})^2 = (25)^2 = 625 \\ \\mathrm{electrons}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $625$ already has three significant figures.\nThus, the crossover between the read-noise-dominated and shot-noise-dominated regimes occurs at a signal level of $625$ electrons.\nThis value is well below the full-well capacity of $5.0 \\times 10^4$ electrons, which confirms that both noise regimes are observable within the pixel's operational dynamic range.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{625}\n$$", "id": "4915319"}, {"introduction": "In low-light imaging scenarios, improving the signal-to-noise ratio ($SNR$) is often a primary goal. This practice explores pixel binning, a common and effective strategy where the charge from adjacent pixels is summed before readout to form a single 'superpixel'.

We shall proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nLet $N_i$ be the random variable representing the number of photons recorded in the $i$-th pixel, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, m\\}$.

Therefore, for each pixel:\n$$E[N_i] = \\mu_0$$\n$$\\text{Var}(N_i) = \\mu_0$$\n\nA \"superpixel\" is formed by binning $m$ adjacent pixels. The count for the superpixel, which we denote as $S$, is the sum of the counts from the $m$ individual pixels:\n$$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} N_i$$\n\nTo derive the distribution of $S$, we use the property that the sum of independent Poisson random variables is itself a Poisson random variable. The mean of the resulting Poisson distribution is the sum of the means of the individual distributions. Since all $N_i$ are independent, the mean of $S$, denoted $E[S]$, is:\n$$E[S] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{m} N_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} E[N_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\mu_0 = m \\mu_0$$\nThus, the distribution of the binned count $S$ is a Poisson distribution with mean $m\\mu_0$:\n$$S \\sim \\text{Poisson}(m \\mu_0)$$\n\nThe variance of the binned count, $\\text{Var}(S)$, can be found directly from its distribution, since the variance of a Poisson variable equals its mean:\n$$\\text{Var}(S) = m \\mu_0$$\nAlternatively, since the individual pixel counts $N_i$ are independent, the variance of their sum is the sum of their variances:\n$$\\text{Var}(S) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{m} N_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\text{Var}(N_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\mu_0 = m \\mu_0$$\nThis confirms that both the mean and the variance of the binned count scale linearly with the binning factor $m$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), defined as the mean divided by the standard deviation ($\\sigma$).\n\nFor a single pixel (before binning), the mean is $\\mu_0$ and the variance is $\\mu_0$.

This trade-off can be understood through the concepts of sampling and linear systems.\n\n1.  **Effective Sampling Pitch**: The original detector has a sampling pitch, say $p$, determined by the center-to-center distance of the small pixels. When $m$ pixels are binned to form a single superpixel, a new, coarser sampling grid is created. For instance, in one-dimensional binning, the new effective sampling pitch becomes $m \\times p$. In two-dimensional binning of an $\\sqrt{m} \\times \\sqrt{m}$ block of pixels, the pitch becomes $\\sqrt{m} \\times p$ in each dimension. This increase in sampling pitch corresponds to a decrease in the spatial sampling frequency. According to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, a lower sampling frequency reduces the maximum spatial frequency (the Nyquist frequency) that can be represented without aliasing, thereby limiting the ability to resolve fine details.\n\n2.  **Modulation Transfer Function (MTF)**: The process of binning can be modeled as a convolution operation. The image signal, initially sampled by the fine pixel grid, is then convolved with a rectangular (or \"boxcar\") function whose spatial extent matches the size of the superpixel. In the frequency domain, this convolution becomes a multiplication. The Fourier transform of a rectangular function is a sinc function ($\\text{sinc}(u) = \\frac{\\sin(\\pi u)}{\\pi u}$). Therefore, the binning operation multiplies the system's original MTF by a sinc function. This sinc function acts as a low-pass filter, attenuating the transfer of mid-to-high spatial frequencies. The larger the binning factor $m$, the wider the rectangular aperture in the spatial domain, which corresponds to a narrower sinc function in the frequency domain. This causes a more rapid fall-off of the overall system MTF, indicating a greater loss of contrast for fine details and thus a degradation of spatial resolution. In summary, binning blurs the image by averaging over a larger area, which is mathematically described by the low-pass filtering effect on the system's MTF.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{m}}$$", "id": "4915263"}]}
