This practice demonstrates how a simple linear model can integrate data from multiple genes—in this case, `VKORC1` affecting drug sensitivity and `CYP2C9` affecting drug clearance—to calculate a starting dose of warfarin. By working through this classic example, you will learn to translate genotype information into a precise, quantitative clinical action. [@problem_id:4959342]", "problem": "A patient requires initiation of warfarin therapy. Warfarin reduces coagulation by inhibiting Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), and its hepatic clearance is primarily mediated by Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9). By the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, single-nucleotide variants in genes can alter messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein function, which in turn modifies pharmacodynamics (VKORC1 sensitivity to warfarin) and pharmacokinetics (CYP2C9-mediated clearance). In clinical pharmacogenomics, when genotype effects on dose requirements are approximately linear and independent over a relevant range, the initial dose can be estimated by additively combining a genotype-neutral baseline with genotype-specific contributions.\n\nConsider a linear additive dosing approach for warfarin weekly dose, in which the genotype-neutral baseline weekly dose is $35$ mg/week, and the genotype-specific contributions (in mg/week) are defined relative to this baseline as follows: for VKORC1 $A/A$, the contribution is $-12$ mg/week (reflecting increased sensitivity and thus a lower required dose), and for CYP2C9 $^{\\ast}1/^{\\ast}3$, the contribution is $-6$ mg/week (reflecting reduced clearance and thus a lower required dose). Assume no other clinical covariates are used for this initial estimate, and that the genotype effects combine additively without interaction at initiation.\n\nUsing only these principles and quantities, compute:\n1) the genotype-guided initial weekly dose in mg/week for a patient who is VKORC1 $A/A$ and CYP2C9 $^{\\ast}1/^{\\ast}3$, and\n2) the relative reduction compared to the genotype-neutral dose, defined as the fraction $\\left(D_{\\text{neutral}} - D_{\\text{genotype}}\\right)/D_{\\text{neutral}}$, where $D_{\\text{neutral}}$ is the genotype-neutral dose and $D_{\\text{genotype}}$ is the genotype-guided dose.\n\nExpress the initial weekly dose in mg/week for intermediate reasoning, but report only the relative reduction as a decimal fraction in your final answer.

The methodology specified is a linear additive model, which is a recognized approach in clinical pharmacogenomics for dose estimation.\n\nThe model posits that the genotype-guided dose, $D_{\\text{genotype}}$, is the sum of a genotype-neutral baseline dose, $D_{\\text{neutral}}$, and the specific dose adjustment contributions from relevant genetic variants. For this problem, the contributing variants are in the genes for VKORC1 and CYP2C9. The governing equation is:\n$$ D_{\\text{genotype}} = D_{\\text{neutral}} + C_{\\text{VKORC1}} + C_{\\text{CYP2C9}} $$\nwhere $C_{\\text{VKORC1}}$ and $C_{\\text{CYP2C9}}$ are the dose contributions for the specified genotypes.\n\nThe problem provides the following quantitative data:\nThe genotype-neutral baseline weekly dose is $D_{\\text{neutral}} = 35 \\text{ mg/week}$.\nThe contribution for the VKORC1 $A/A$ genotype is $C_{\\text{VKORC1}} = -12 \\text{ mg/week}$.\nThe contribution for the CYP2C9 $^{\\ast}1/^{\\ast}3$ genotype is $C_{\\text{CYP2C9}} = -6 \\text{ mg/week}$.\n\nThe problem states that these genotype effects combine additively without interaction. Therefore, for a patient with the genotype VKORC1 $A/A$ and CYP2C9 $^{\\ast}1/^{\\ast}3$, the genotype-guided initial weekly dose is calculated by substituting the given values into the equation:\n$$ D_{\\text{genotype}} = 35 + (-12) + (-6) $$\n$$ D_{\\text{genotype}} = 35 - 12 - 6 $$\n$$ D_{\\text{genotype}} = 17 \\text{ mg/week} $$\n\nThe second task is to compute the relative reduction of the genotype-guided dose compared to the genotype-neutral dose. The formula for this relative reduction, which we shall denote as $R$, is given in the problem statement:\n$$ R = \\frac{D_{\\text{neutral}} - D_{\\text{genotype}}}{D_{\\text{neutral}}} $$\n\nSubstituting the value of $D_{\\text{neutral}} = 35 \\text{ mg/week}$ and the calculated value of $D_{\\text{genotype}} = 17 \\text{ mg/week}$:\n$$ R = \\frac{35 - 17}{35} $$\n$$ R = \\frac{18}{35} $$\n\nTo provide the answer as a decimal fraction, we perform the division:\n$$ R = 0.5142857\\overline{142857}... $$\n\nThe problem requires this decimal fraction to be rounded to four significant figures.
