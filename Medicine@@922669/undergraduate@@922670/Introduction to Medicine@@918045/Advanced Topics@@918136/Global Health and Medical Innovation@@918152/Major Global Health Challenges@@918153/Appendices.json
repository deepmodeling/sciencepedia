Two geographically matched districts are followed prospectively for variable durations. In the intervention district, all eligible adults receive the program; the comparison district continues usual care. Over the study, the following aggregate data are recorded:\n\n- Intervention district: $189$ first events over $25{,}200$ person-years.\n- Comparison district: $248$ first events over $24{,}800$ person-years.\n\nAssume that within each district the event process can be modeled by a time-homogeneous hazard (that is, the hazard is constant over time), losses to follow-up are independent of event occurrence, and migration between districts is negligible.\n\nUsing only these data and assumptions, do the following:\n\n1) Compute the incidence rate in each district and express each as events per $1{,}000$ person-years.\n\n2) Using the incidence rate ratio as an estimator under the stated assumptions, compute the hazard ratio comparing intervention to comparison.\n\n3) Using the constant-hazard model, compute the absolute risk reduction over $5$ years attributable to the intervention, expressed as a decimal (do not use a percent sign).\n\n4) Briefly interpret, in one sentence, the public health significance of the absolute risk reduction you computed, in terms of expected events averted per $1{,}000$ adults treated for $5$ years.\n\nRound each computed quantity in parts $1$–$3$ to three significant figures.

It is scientifically grounded in standard epidemiological principles, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. The assumptions provided—namely, a time-homogeneous hazard, independent censoring, and negligible migration—are standard for simplifying the analysis of prospective cohort data and allow for a direct and unique solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing each of the four parts of the problem statement in sequence.\n\nLet $E_I$ and $PT_I$ denote the number of first events and the total person-years of follow-up in the intervention district, respectively.\nLet $E_C$ and $PT_C$ denote the number of first events and the total person-years of follow-up in the comparison district, respectively.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n$E_I = 189$\n$PT_I = 25{,}200 \\text{ years}$\n$E_C = 248$\n$PT_C = 24{,}800 \\text{ years}$\n\nThe assumption of a time-homogeneous (constant) hazard, $\\lambda$, within each district allows us to estimate this hazard rate using the incidence rate ($IR$). The incidence rate is defined as the number of new events divided by the total person-time at risk.\n$IR = \\frac{E}{PT}$\nThis $IR$ serves as the maximum likelihood estimate of the constant hazard rate $\\lambda$.\n\n1) Compute the incidence rate in each district.\n\nFor the intervention district, the incidence rate ($IR_I$) is:\n$$IR_I = \\frac{E_I}{PT_I} = \\frac{189}{25{,}200} \\text{ events per person-year}$$\nTo express this per $1{,}000$ person-years, we multiply by $1{,}000$:\n$$IR_I (\\text{per } 1000 \\text{ PY}) = \\frac{189}{25{,}200} \\times 1000 = 7.5$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the incidence rate in the intervention district is $7.50$ events per $1{,}000$ person-years.\n\nFor the comparison district, the incidence rate ($IR_C$) is:\n$$IR_C = \\frac{E_C}{PT_C} = \\frac{248}{24{,}800} \\text{ events per person-year}$$\nTo express this per $1{,}000$ person-years, we multiply by $1{,}000$:\n$$IR_C (\\text{per } 1000 \\text{ PY}) = \\frac{248}{24{,}800} \\times 1000 = 10$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the incidence rate in the comparison district is $10.0$ events per $1{,}000$ person-years.\n\n2) Compute the hazard ratio ($HR$).\n\nThe hazard ratio is the ratio of the hazard rate in the intervention group ($\\lambda_I$) to the hazard rate in the comparison group ($\\lambda_C$). Under the constant-hazard assumption, the incidence rate ratio ($IRR$) is a consistent estimator of the hazard ratio.\n$$HR = \\frac{\\lambda_I}{\\lambda_C} \\approx \\frac{IR_I}{IR_C}$$\nUsing the rates calculated in events per person-year:\n$IR_I = \\frac{189}{25{,}200} = 0.0075 \\text{ year}^{-1}$\n$IR_C = \\frac{248}{24{,}800} = 0.01 \\text{ year}^{-1}$\n$$HR \\approx \\frac{0.0075}{0.01} = 0.75$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the hazard ratio is $0.750$.\n\n3) Compute the absolute risk reduction ($ARR$) over $5$ years.\n\nUnder a constant hazard model, the cumulative risk of an event by time $t$, $R(t)$, is related to the hazard rate $\\lambda$ by the formula:\n$$R(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\nwhere $S(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$ is the survival function, i.e., the probability of not having an event by time $t$.\n\nWe use the estimated hazard rates $\\lambda_I \\approx 0.0075 \\text{ year}^{-1}$ and $\\lambda_C \\approx 0.01 \\text{ year}^{-1}$. We need to compute the risk over a period of $t=5$ years.\n\nThe $5$-year risk in the comparison group, $R_C(5)$, is:\n$$R_C(5) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_C \\times 5) = 1 - \\exp(-0.01 \\times 5) = 1 - \\exp(-0.05)$$\n$$R_C(5) \\approx 1 - 0.951229 = 0.048771$$\n\nThe $5$-year risk in the intervention group, $R_I(5)$, is:\n$$R_I(5) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_I \\times 5) = 1 - \\exp(-0.0075 \\times 5) = 1 - \\exp(-0.0375)$$\n$$R_I(5) \\approx 1 - 0.963194 = 0.036806$$\n\nThe absolute risk reduction ($ARR$) over $5$ years is the difference between these two risks:\n$$ARR(5) = R_C(5) - R_I(5)$$\n$$ARR(5) = (1 - \\exp(-0.05)) - (1 - \\exp(-0.0375))$$\n$$ARR(5) = \\exp(-0.0375) - \\exp(-0.05)$$\n$$ARR(5) \\approx 0.048771 - 0.036806 = 0.011965$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the absolute risk reduction over $5$ years is $0.0120$.\n\n4) Briefly interpret the public health significance of the absolute risk reduction.\n\nThe absolute risk reduction of $0.0120$ over $5$ years represents the proportion of the population for which an event is averted due to the intervention over that time period. To express this in terms of events averted per $1{,}000$ adults, we multiply the $ARR$ by $1{,}000$: $0.0120 \\times 1000 = 12$. The public health significance is that for every $1{,}000$ adults receiving the community-based program for $5$ years, approximately $12$ major adverse cardiovascular events are expected to be averted compared to those receiving usual care.\n\nThe final numeric answers for grading are ordered as requested: comparison incidence rate ($10.0$), intervention incidence rate ($7.50$), hazard ratio ($0.750$), and $5$-year absolute risk reduction ($0.0120$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 10.0 & 7.50 & 0.750 & 0.0120 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4967943"}, {"introduction": "Implementing a widespread screening program is a complex decision with significant health and economic implications.
