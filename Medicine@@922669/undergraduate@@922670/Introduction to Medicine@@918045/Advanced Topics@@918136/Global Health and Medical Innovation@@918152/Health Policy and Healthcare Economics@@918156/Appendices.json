To do this, we first calculate the $PVAF(r, T)$ for the given parameters:\n$$\nPVAF(0.03, 5) = \\frac{1 - (1+0.03)^{-5}}{0.03} = \\frac{1 - (1.03)^{-5}}{0.03}\n$$\nNumerically, $(1.03)^{-5} \\approx 0.86260879$.\n$$\nPVAF(0.03, 5) \\approx \\frac{1 - 0.86260879}{0.03} = \\frac{0.13739121}{0.03} \\approx 4.579707\n$$\nWe shall retain this factor in symbolic form for as long as possible to maintain precision.\n\nNow, we compute the present value of costs for each strategy:\n- Present Value of Costs for Status Quo ($PV_{C_0}$):\n$$\nPV_{C_0} = c_0 \\cdot PVAF(0.03, 5) = 2000 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1 - (1.03)^{-5}}{0.03}\\right) \\approx 2000 \\cdot 4.579707 = 9159.414\n$$\n- Present Value of Costs for Intervention ($PV_{C_1}$):\n$$\nPV_{C_1} = c_1 \\cdot PVAF(0.03, 5) = 2500 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1 - (1.03)^{-5}}{0.03}\\right) \\approx 2500 \\cdot 4.579707 = 11449.268\n$$\nNext, we compute the present value of QALYs for each strategy.
