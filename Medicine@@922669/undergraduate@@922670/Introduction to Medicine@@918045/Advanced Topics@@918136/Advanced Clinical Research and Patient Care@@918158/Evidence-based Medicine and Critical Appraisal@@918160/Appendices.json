It is scientifically grounded in the principles of biostatistics and evidence-based medicine, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We may therefore proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of several key metrics used in clinical trials, based on the provided risks for a control group and an intervention group. Let $p_C$ be the risk (cumulative incidence) of the event in the control group and $p_I$ be the risk in the intervention group.\n\nThe given values are:\nRisk in the control arm, $p_C = 0.20$.\nRisk in the intervention arm, $p_I = 0.15$.\n\nWe can conceptualize the data using a standard $2 \\times 2$ contingency table. Let 'Event' be hospitalization for heart failure and 'No Event' be its absence. Let the two groups be 'Intervention' and 'Control'. The probabilities for a randomly selected individual from each arm are:\n$P(\\text{Event} | \\text{Intervention}) = p_I = 0.15$\n$P(\\text{No Event} | \\text{Intervention}) = 1 - p_I = 0.85$\n$P(\\text{Event} | \\text{Control}) = p_C = 0.20$\n$P(\\text{No Event} | \\text{Control}) = 1 - p_C = 0.80$\n\n**1. Derivations of Measures**\n\n- **Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR):** The ARR is the absolute difference in the risk of the outcome between the control and intervention groups. It quantifies the absolute effect of the intervention.\n$$\nARR = p_C - p_I\n$$\n\n- **Relative Risk (RR):** The RR, also known as the risk ratio, is the ratio of the risk in the intervention group to the risk in the control group. It quantifies the multiplicative effect of the intervention on the risk.\n$$\nRR = \\frac{p_I}{p_C}\n$$\n\n- **Odds Ratio (OR):** To define the OR, we must first define the odds of an event. The odds of an event is the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring.\nThe odds of the event in the control group is $Odds_C = \\frac{p_C}{1-p_C}$.\nThe odds of the event in the intervention group is $Odds_I = \\frac{p_I}{1-p_I}$.\nThe Odds Ratio is the ratio of these two odds.\n$$\nOR = \\frac{Odds_I}{Odds_C} = \\frac{p_I / (1-p_I)}{p_C / (1-p_C)} = \\frac{p_I(1-p_C)}{p_C(1-p_I)}\n$$\n\n- **Number Needed to Treat (NNT):** The NNT is the average number of patients who must be treated with the intervention to prevent one additional adverse outcome, compared to the control group. It is the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Reduction.\n$$\nNNT = \\frac{1}{ARR} = \\frac{1}{p_C - p_I}\n$$\n\n**2. Computation of Measures**\n\nUsing the given risks, $p_C = 0.20$ and $p_I = 0.15$:\n\n- **Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR):**\n$$\nARR = 0.20 - 0.15 = 0.05\n$$\n\n- **Relative Risk (RR):**\n$$\nRR = \\frac{0.15}{0.20} = \\frac{15}{20} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75\n$$\n\n- **Odds Ratio (OR):**\nFirst, we find the odds for each group:\n$Odds_I = \\frac{0.15}{1-0.15} = \\frac{0.15}{0.85} = \\frac{15}{85} = \\frac{3}{17}$\n$Odds_C = \\frac{0.20}{1-0.20} = \\frac{0.20}{0.80} = \\frac{20}{80} = \\frac{1}{4}$\nNow, we compute the ratio of the odds:\n$$\nOR = \\frac{3/17}{1/4} = \\frac{3}{17} \\times 4 = \\frac{12}{17} \\approx 0.705882...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as instructed, we get $OR \\approx 0.7059$.\n\n- **Number Needed to Treat (NNT):**\n$$\nNNT = \\frac{1}{ARR} = \\frac{1}{0.05} = 20\n$$\nSince this is an exact reciprocal, it is reported as an integer.\n\n**3. Verbal Interpretation of Measures**\n\n- **ARR = 0.05:** The intervention with the new SGLT2 inhibitor reduces the absolute probability of hospitalization for heart failure by $0.05$ (or $5$ percentage points) over a $1$-year period compared to standard care.\n- **RR = 0.75:** A patient receiving the new intervention has $0.75$ times the risk (or $75\\%$ of the risk) of hospitalization for heart failure over $1$ year, compared to a patient receiving standard care. This is equivalent to a relative risk reduction of $1 - 0.75 = 0.25$ or $25\\%$.\n- **OR $\\approx$ 0.7059:** For any given patient, the odds of being hospitalized for heart failure while on the new intervention are approximately $0.7059$ times the odds of being hospitalized while on standard care.\n- **NNT = 20:** On average, one must treat $20$ patients with the new SGLT2 inhibitor for $1$ year to prevent one additional case of hospitalization for heart failure that would have occurred on standard care.\n\n**4. Relationship Between Odds Ratio (OR) and Relative Risk (RR)**\n\nThe OR and RR are distinct measures that are only equal under specific circumstances. Their mathematical relationship is:\n$$\nOR = \\frac{p_I(1-p_C)}{p_C(1-p_I)} = \\left(\\frac{p_I}{p_C}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1-p_C}{1-p_I}\\right) = RR \\times \\left(\\frac{1-p_C}{1-p_I}\\right)\n$$\nThe OR is equal to the RR multiplied by a \"correction factor\" $\\frac{1-p_C}{1-p_I}$.\n\nThe OR differs from the RR in this setting because the cumulative incidences (risks) of the event are not small. Specifically, $p_C=0.20$ and $p_I=0.15$. The correction factor is:\n$$\n\\frac{1-p_C}{1-p_I} = \\frac{1-0.20}{1-0.15} = \\frac{0.80}{0.85} = \\frac{80}{85} = \\frac{16}{17} \\approx 0.9412\n$$\nSince this factor is not equal to $1$, the OR will not be equal to the RR. For a beneficial treatment (where $p_I < p_C$), we have $1-p_I > 1-p_C$, so the correction factor is less than $1$. This causes the OR to be smaller than the RR ($OR < RR < 1$). Our calculated values confirm this: $OR \\approx 0.7059$ and $RR = 0.75$.\n\nThe OR approximates the RR only when the event is \"rare\", meaning $p_C$ and $p_I$ are both very close to $0$. In that case, $1-p_C \\approx 1$ and $1-p_I \\approx 1$, rendering the correction factor close to $1$. In this problem, an event risk of $20\\%$ is common enough for the two measures to diverge noticeably. The OR is a non-collapsible measure of association, and for a beneficial intervention, it will always show a stronger effect (i.e., its value will be further from the null value of $1$) than the RR, unless the event is rare.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20}$$", "id": "4833368"}, {"introduction": "Evidence-based diagnosis involves formally updating our suspicion for a disease based on new test results. This process is quantified using a form of Bayes' theorem, where likelihood ratios ($LR$s) serve as the engine for updating our beliefs from a pre-test to a post-test probability.

The concepts of pre-test probability, likelihood ratio, and post-test probability are standard in evidence-based medicine and biostatistics. The provided definition of $LR^{+}$ is correct. The values are realistic. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data ($P_{pre}$ and $LR^{+}$) to calculate the post-test probability. The question is specific and has a unique, stable solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, standard terminology. There is no subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first converting the pre-test probability into pre-test odds, then using the positive likelihood ratio to find the post-test odds, and finally converting the post-test odds back into the post-test probability. This is a standard application of Bayes' theorem in its odds-likelihood form.\n\nLet $D$ denote the event that the patient has the disease, and $T+$ denote the event that the test result is positive.\nThe pre-test probability is given as $P(D) = P_{pre} = 0.20$.\nThe probability of not having the disease is $P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\n\nThe pre-test odds of having the disease are defined as the ratio of the probability of having the disease to the probability of not having the disease:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{pre} = \\frac{P(D)}{P(\\neg D)} = \\frac{P_{pre}}{1 - P_{pre}} $$\nSubstituting the given pre-test probability:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{pre} = \\frac{0.20}{1 - 0.20} = \\frac{0.20}{0.80} = 0.25 $$\n\nBayes' theorem in its odds-likelihood ratio form states that the post-test odds are the product of the pre-test odds and the likelihood ratio. For a positive test result, we use the positive likelihood ratio, $LR^{+}$:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{post} = \\text{Odds}_{pre} \\times LR^{+} $$\nThe problem provides $LR^{+} = 6$. We can now calculate the post-test odds:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{post} = 0.25 \\times 6 = 1.5 $$\n\nThe post-test odds must be converted back to a probability. The post-test probability, $P_{post}$, is the probability of having the disease given a positive test result, $P(D \\mid T+)$. The relationship between odds and probability is:\n$$ P_{post} = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{post}}{1 + \\text{Odds}_{post}} $$\nSubstituting the calculated value for the post-test odds:\n$$ P_{post} = \\frac{1.5}{1 + 1.5} = \\frac{1.5}{2.5} $$\nThis fraction simplifies to:\n$$ P_{post} = \\frac{15}{25} = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6 $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact value is $0.6$, which can be written as $0.6000$ to express four significant figures.\n\nFinally, we must determine if treatment should be initiated. The decision threshold for treatment is a post-test probability of at least $0.50$.\nOur calculated post-test probability is $P_{post} = 0.6000$.\nComparing the post-test probability to the threshold:\n$$ 0.6000 \\ge 0.50 $$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, the post-test probability meets and exceeds the treatment threshold. The clinician should initiate treatment.
