The disorder is autosomal recessive and fully penetrant, caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in a single gene.\n2.  A couple has one child affected by this disorder.\n3.  The couple has no known consanguinity and no prior family history of the disorder.\n4.  Standard population genetics assumptions apply: large, random-mating population; rare disease.\n5.  There are no phenocopies.\n6.  The de novo mutation rate for producing two pathogenic alleles is negligible.\n7.  Mendelian segregation applies, and the genetic outcome for each child is independent.\n8.  The task is to compute the recurrence risk for the next child, conditional on having one affected child.\n9.  The method must use definitions of autosomal recessive inheritance and conditional probability.\n10. The final answer must be a reduced fraction.\n\n**Validation Analysis:**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the fundamental principles of Mendelian genetics. An autosomal recessive disorder requires an individual to inherit two copies of a pathogenic allele, one from each parent. The condition that the couple already has an affected child is the crucial piece of information. The problem is well-posed, as this information is sufficient to determine the parental genotypes with certainty under the given assumptions (full penetrance, no phenocopies, negligible de novo mutations). The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and logically consistent. It is a classic, realistic scenario encountered in medical genetics and genetic counseling. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nLet `$A$` denote the dominant, wild-type allele and `$a$` denote the recessive, pathogenic allele. For an autosomal recessive disorder, the genotypes correspond to phenotypes as follows:\n-   Genotype `$AA$`: Unaffected, non-carrier.\n-   Genotype `$Aa$`: Unaffected, carrier.\n-   Genotype `$aa$`: Affected.\n\nThe problem states that the couple has one child who is affected by the disorder. This means the affected child's genotype must be `$aa$`.\n\nTo produce a child with genotype `$aa$`, the child must inherit one `$a$` allele from each parent. This provides definitive information about the parents' genotypes. Since the parents are phenotypically unaffected (as implied by \"no prior family history\" and the general context of calculating recurrence risk for a couple that can have children), their genotype cannot be `$aa$`. For each parent to contribute an `$a$` allele while being unaffected, they must both be heterozygous carriers. Therefore, the genotype of both the mother and the father must be `$Aa$`. The observation that they have an affected child makes them \"obligate carriers\".\n\nThe problem asks for the recurrence risk, which is the probability that the couple's next child will be affected. This can be framed as a conditional probability:\nLet `$C_1$` be the event that the first child is affected.\nLet `$C_2$` be the event that the second (next) child is affected.\nWe are asked to find `$P(C_2 | C_1)$`.\n\nThe genotypes of successive children are independent events, conditional on the fixed genotypes of the parents. That is, `$P(C_2 | C_1, G_{\\text{parents}}) = P(C_2 | G_{\\text{parents}})$`, where `$G_{\\text{parents}}$` represents the genotypes of the parents.\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine `$G_{\\text{parents}}$`. The event `$C_1$` (first child has genotype `$aa$`) updates our knowledge of the parental genotypes. As established above, given full penetrance and negligible de novo mutation rates, the event `$C_1$` is only possible if both parents are carriers (`$Aa \\times Aa$`). In Bayesian terms, the posterior probability of the parents being carriers, given an affected child, is `$1$`.\n`$P(G_{\\text{parents}} = Aa \\times Aa | C_1) = 1$`.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to calculating the probability of having an affected child, given that the parents' genotypes are `$Aa$` and `$Aa$`.\n`$P(C_2 | C_1) = P(C_2 | G_{\\text{parents}} = Aa \\times Aa)$`.\n\nWe can determine the probabilities of the offspring's genotypes from an `$Aa \\times Aa$` cross using a Punnett square, based on the principle of Mendelian segregation. Each parent transmits either allele `$A$` or `$a$` with a probability of `$\\frac{1}{2}$`.\n\nThe possible genotypes of an offspring are:\n1.  `$AA$`: Child inherits `$A$` from the mother (probability `$\\frac{1}{2}$`) and `$A$` from the father (probability `$\\frac{1}{2}$`).\n    `$P(AA) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$`. This child is unaffected.\n2.  `$Aa$`: Child inherits `$A$` from the mother and `$a$` from the father, OR `$a$` from the mother and `$A$` from the father.\n    `$P(Aa) = (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$`. This child is an unaffected carrier.\n3.  `$aa$`: Child inherits `$a$` from the mother (probability `$\\frac{1}{2}$`) and `$a$` from the father (probability `$\\frac{1}{2}$`).\n    `$P(aa) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$`. This child is affected.\n\nThe recurrence risk is the probability that the next child will be affected, which corresponds to the genotype `$aa$`. From the calculation above, this probability is `$\\frac{1}{4}$`. The extensive information about population genetics and the mention of Bayes' theorem, while technically relevant to a full formal derivation, are rendered simple by the conditioning event (having an affected child), which removes all uncertainty about the parental carrier status. The risk for every subsequent pregnancy is independent and remains `$\\frac{1}{4}$`.\n\nThe final answer is the probability of the `$aa$` genotype.\nRecurrence Risk `$ = P(aa) = \\frac{1}{4}$`.\nThis is a reduced fraction as requested.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$$", "id": "4968954"}, {"introduction": "Genetic risk is often more complex than simple Mendelian ratios suggest, as the link between genotype and phenotype is not always absolute.

This is the probability of a positive test given that the disease is present.\n- The specificity of the test: $P(T^-|D^c) = 0.999 = \\frac{999}{1000}$. This is the probability of a negative test given that the disease is absent.\n\nFrom these givens, we can derive other necessary probabilities:\n- The probability that the fetus does not have trisomy $21$: $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - \\frac{1}{200} = \\frac{199}{200}$.\n- The false negative rate, which is the probability of a negative test given the disease is present: $P(T^-|D) = 1 - P(T^+|D) = 1 - \\frac{99}{100} = \\frac{1}{100}$.\n- The false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test given the disease is absent: $P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - \\frac{999}{1000} = \\frac{1}{1000}$.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\n\nThe PPV is the probability of having the disease given a positive test result, which is $P(D|T^+)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D)P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nTo find $P(D|T^+)$, we first need to calculate the total probability of a positive test result, $P(T^+)$, using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the known values as exact fractions:\n$$P(T^+) = \\left(\\frac{99}{100}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{200}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{1000}\\right)\\left(\\frac{199}{200}\\right)$$\n$$P(T^+) = \\frac{99}{20000} + \\frac{199}{200000}$$\nTo add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $200000$:\n$$P(T^+) = \\frac{99 \\times 10}{200000} + \\frac{199}{200000} = \\frac{990}{200000} + \\frac{199}{200000} = \\frac{990 + 199}{200000} = \\frac{1189}{200000}$$\nNow, we can compute the PPV, $P(D|T^+)$. The numerator of Bayes' theorem is the term $P(T^+|D)P(D) = \\frac{99}{20000}$.\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{\\frac{99}{20000}}{\\frac{1189}{200000}} = \\frac{99}{20000} \\times \\frac{200000}{1189} = \\frac{99 \\times 10}{1189} = \\frac{990}{1189}$$\nThe prime factorization of the numerator is $990 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 11$. The denominator $1189$ is not divisible by $2$, $3$, $5$, or $11$. Further investigation shows $1189 = 29 \\times 41$. Since there are no common factors, the fraction $\\frac{990}{1189}$ is in its simplest form.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Residual Risk after a Negative Result**\n\nThe residual risk is the probability of having the disease given a negative test result, which is $P(D|T^-)$. Using Bayes' theorem again:\n$$P(D|T^-) = \\frac{P(T^-|D)P(D)}{P(T^-)}$$\nFirst, we calculate the total probability of a negative test result, $P(T^-)$, using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^-|D)P(D) + P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the known values as exact fractions:\n$$P(T^-) = \\left(\\frac{1}{100}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{200}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{999}{1000}\\right)\\left(\\frac{199}{200}\\right)$$\n$$P(T^-) = \\frac{1}{20000} + \\frac{999 \\times 199}{200000}$$\nTo compute the product $999 \\times 199$, we have $999 \\times 199 = 198801$.\n$$P(T^-) = \\frac{1 \\times 10}{200000} + \\frac{198801}{200000} = \\frac{10 + 198801}{200000} = \\frac{198811}{200000}$$\n(Alternatively, $P(T^-) = 1 - P(T^+) = 1 - \\frac{1189}{200000} = \\frac{200000-1189}{200000} = \\frac{198811}{200000}$.)\nNow, we can compute the residual risk, $P(D|T^-)$.
