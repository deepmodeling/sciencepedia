You are asked to reason from fundamental principles of virus–host cell interaction to explain the expected resistance pattern to human immunodeficiency virus type $1$ (HIV-$1$) and to appraise any residual susceptibility. As your starting base, assume the following well-tested facts: HIV-$1$ entry into target cells requires sequential binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 to the host receptor CD4, followed by engagement of a chemokine co-receptor, most commonly C-C motif chemokine receptor $5$ (CCR$5$) or C-X-C motif chemokine receptor $4$ (CXCR$4$), which then triggers gp41-mediated membrane fusion; the CCR$5$-$\\Delta 32$ mutation is a $32$ base pair deletion in CCR$5$ that results in a truncated product not expressed at the cell surface. Based on these principles, which option best articulates the mechanistic rationale for resistance to R$5$-tropic HIV-$1$ and evaluates residual susceptibility to X$4$-tropic strains in this genotype?\n\nA. Homozygous CCR$5$-$\\Delta 32$ prevents surface expression of functional CCR$5$, so after gp120 binds CD4, R$5$-tropic virions cannot engage a co-receptor and fusion fails; because CXCR$4$ expression is unaffected, X$4$-tropic and dual-tropic strains can still enter via CD4/CXCR$4$, so susceptibility to those strains remains.\n\nB. Homozygous CCR$5$-$\\Delta 32$ eliminates CD4 expression, preventing gp120 binding and conferring complete resistance to all HIV-$1$ strains, including X$4$-tropic variants.\n\nC.

Homozygous CCR$5$-$\\Delta 32$ impairs viral reverse transcriptase fidelity, blocking productive infection by R$5$-tropic strains, while X$4$-tropic strains remain unaffected because they use a distinct polymerase.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective, allowing for a logical derivation from the provided principles.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the sequential, multi-step process of human immunodeficiency virus type $1$ (HIV-$1$) entry into a host cell. The provided axioms establish this process as:\n$1$. The viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 binds to the primary host cell receptor, CD4.\n$2$. This binding induces a conformational change in gp120, exposing a binding site for a co-receptor.\n$3$. The gp120 protein then engages with a chemokine co-receptor, which is typically either C-C motif chemokine receptor $5$ (CCR$5$) for R$5$-tropic strains or C-X-C motif chemokine receptor $4$ (CXCR$4$) for X$4$-tropic strains.\n$4$. The binding to the co-receptor triggers another conformational change, leading to the activation and insertion of the viral fusion peptide, gp41, into the host cell membrane, mediating the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes and allowing the viral capsid to enter the cytoplasm.\n\nThe individual in question is homozygous for the CCR$5$-$\\Delta 32$ variant. The problem specifies that this genetic variant, a $32$ base pair deletion, results in a frameshift mutation. This leads to the synthesis of a truncated, nonfunctional protein product that is not transported to the cell surface. Consequently, the individual's cells that would normally express CCR$5$ (such as CD4$^+$ T-lymphocytes and macrophages) lack this specific co-receptor on their plasma membrane.\n\nLet us analyze the consequences for different HIV-$1$ strains:\n\n**Resistance to R$5$-tropic HIV-$1$:**\nAn R$5$-tropic virion initiates infection by binding to CD4 on a target cell. This step proceeds normally, as the expression of CD4 is unaffected by the CCR$5$ mutation. However, the next crucial step is the engagement of the CCR$5$ co-receptor. Since the individual's cells do not express CCR$5$ on their surface, the gp120 protein cannot bind to its required co-receptor. This failure to engage the co-receptor prevents the downstream activation of gp41 and the subsequent membrane fusion. The viral entry process is aborted at this stage. Therefore, the individual is highly resistant to infection by R$5$-tropic strains of HIV-$1$.\n\n**Susceptibility to X$4$-tropic HIV-$1$:**\nAn X$4$-tropic virion uses CXCR$4$ as its co-receptor. The CCR$5$-$\\Delta 32$ mutation is specific to the CCR$5$ gene and does not alter the gene for CXCR$4$ or its expression on the cell surface. Thus, the individual's CD4$^+$ cells continue to express functional CXCR$4$ receptors. An X$4$-tropic virus can successfully complete its entry sequence: it binds to CD4, then engages the readily available CXCR$4$ co-receptor, triggering gp41-mediated fusion and cell entry. The genetic makeup of this individual provides no barrier to this pathway. The same logic applies to dual-tropic strains, which can utilize CXCR$4$.\n\n**Conclusion:** The homozygous CCR$5$-$\\Delta 32$ genotype confers specific and potent resistance to R$5$-tropic HIV-$1$ by eliminating a necessary co-receptor for viral entry, but it does not protect against strains that use the alternate co-receptor, CXCR$4$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option based on this derivation.\n\n**A. Homozygous CCR$5$-$\\Delta 32$ prevents surface expression of functional CCR$5$, so after gp120 binds CD4, R$5$-tropic virions cannot engage a co-receptor and fusion fails; because CXCR$4$ expression is unaffected, X$4$-tropic and dual-tropic strains can still enter via CD4/CXCR$4$, so susceptibility to those strains remains.**\nThis option accurately describes the molecular mechanism. It correctly states that the lack of surface CCR$5$ blocks R$5$-tropic virus entry after the initial CD4 binding step. It also correctly notes that CXCR$4$ expression is independent of the CCR$5$ genotype and that susceptibility to X$4$- and dual-tropic strains is retained. This aligns perfectly with our derivation from first principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Homozygous CCR$5$-$\\Delta 32$ eliminates CD4 expression, preventing gp120 binding and conferring complete resistance to all HIV-$1$ strains, including X$4$-tropic variants.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The gene for CCR$5$ is on human chromosome $3$, while the gene for CD4 is on chromosome $12$. A mutation in one does not affect the expression of the other. Therefore, the premise that CD4 expression is eliminated is false, invalidating the entire conclusion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Homozygous CCR$5$-$\\Delta 32$ increases CCR$5$ surface density, competitively inhibiting gp120 binding and indirectly downregulating CXCR$4$, thereby conferring resistance to both R$5$- and X$4$-tropic strains.**\nThis statement directly contradicts the provided information that the CCR$5$-$\\Delta 32$ mutation results in a product *not expressed at the cell surface*. It does not increase surface density; it ablates it. The subsequent claims are therefore baseless.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Homozygous CCR$5$-$\\Delta 32$ produces a nonfunctional CCR$5$ that HIV-$1$ substitutes with CCR$2$ as a co-receptor, preserving susceptibility to R$5$-tropic strains but reducing susceptibility to X$4$-tropic strains.**\nWhile some minor usage of other chemokine receptors like CCR$2$ has been documented *in vitro*, it is not an efficient or primary pathway that \"preserves susceptibility\" to R$5$-tropic strains in individuals lacking CCR$5$. The primary outcome is resistance, not co-receptor switching. Furthermore, there is no established mechanism by which a lack of CCR$5$ would reduce susceptibility to X$4$-tropic strains.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Homozygous CCR$5$-$\\Delta 32$ impairs viral reverse transcriptase fidelity, blocking productive infection by R$5$-tropic strains, while X$4$-tropic strains remain unaffected because they use a distinct polymerase.**\nThis option misidentifies the affected stage of the viral life cycle. The CCR$5$ receptor is involved in viral *entry*, a process that precedes reverse transcription. The host cell genotype does not impact the function of the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme. Additionally, all HIV-$1$ strains use the same HIV-$1$ reverse transcriptase, not distinct polymerases based on tropism.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4964451"}, {"introduction": "Once inside a host cell, HIV's survival strategy hinges on rapid and relentless replication. However, its reproductive machinery is notoriously imprecise, leading to a high rate of genetic mutations. This exercise [@problem_id:4964466] uses fundamental principles of probability to quantify this mutational burden, providing a tangible number that explains how HIV exists not as a single entity, but as a diverse 'quasispecies'—the very engine of its evolution and its ability to develop drug resistance.", "problem": "A key feature of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) biology is the high frequency of replication errors made by the viral reverse transcriptase.

Round your numerical answer to three significant figures. Finally, explain, using first principles of stochastic mutation and selection, how this expected mutational burden shapes the emergence of antiretroviral resistance in a large, replicating viral population.", "solution": "The problem asks for a derivation of the expected number of point mutations in an HIV genome per replication cycle, a numerical calculation of this value, and a conceptual explanation of its role in the evolution of drug resistance. The validation of the problem statement confirms that it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and based on realistic parameters. We can therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first task is to derive the expected number of point mutations per genome per replication cycle. Let the length of the viral genome be $L$ bases. For each base $i$, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $L$, we define an indicator random variable, $X_i$. This variable takes the value $1$ if a point mutation occurs at base $i$ during a replication cycle, and $0$ if no mutation occurs.\n$$\nX_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if a mutation occurs at base } i \\\\\n0 & \\text{if no mutation occurs at base } i\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe problem states that a point mutation occurs with a probability $p$ per base. Therefore, for each base $i$, the probability distribution of $X_i$ is given by:\n$$\nP(X_i = 1) = p\n$$\n$$\nP(X_i = 0) = 1 - p\n$$\nThis defines a Bernoulli trial for each base. The expectation, or expected value, of a random variable is the sum of the possible values, each weighted by its probability. For the indicator variable $X_i$, the expectation $E[X_i]$ is:\n$$\nE[X_i] = (1 \\cdot P(X_i = 1)) + (0 \\cdot P(X_i = 0)) = (1 \\cdot p) + (0 \\cdot (1-p)) = p\n$$\nThus, the expected number of mutations at a single base is simply the probability of mutation at that base.\n\nThe total number of mutations in the entire genome, which we denote by the random variable $X$, is the sum of the mutations at each base. The problem states that the mutations at each base are independent events.\n$$\nX = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} X_i\n$$\nTo find the expected total number of mutations, $E[X]$, we use the property of linearity of expectation. This property states that the expectation of a sum of random variables is equal to the sum of their individual expectations, regardless of whether the variables are independent.\n$$\nE[X] = E\\left[ \\sum_{i=1}^{L} X_i \\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} E[X_i]\n$$\nSince $E[X_i] = p$ for every base $i$ from $1$ to $L$, we are summing the constant value $p$ a total of $L$ times.\n$$\nE[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} p = L \\cdot p\n$$\nThis derivation, starting from the definition of expectation for a single Bernoulli trial and using the linearity of expectation, establishes that the expected number of point mutations per genome per replication cycle is a function of the genome length $L$ and the mutation probability per base $p$, given by the product $Lp$.\n\nThe second task is to compute this expected value using the provided empirical data. The per-base error rate is given as $p = 3 \\times 10^{-5}$ mutations per base per replication. The HIV genome size is $L = 9.7\\,\\text{kb}$. We must first convert the genome length from kilobases (kb) to bases. Since $1\\,\\text{kb} = 1000$ bases:\n$$\nL = 9.7\\,\\text{kb} = 9.7 \\times 1000 = 9700\\,\\text{bases}\n$$\nNow, we can substitute the values of $L$ and $p$ into our derived formula for the expected number of mutations, $E[X]$:\n$$\nE[X] = L p = (9700) \\times (3 \\times 10^{-5})\n$$\n$$\nE[X] = (9.7 \\times 10^3) \\times (3 \\times 10^{-5}) = 29.1 \\times 10^{3-5} = 29.1 \\times 10^{-2} = 0.291\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $0.291$ already has three significant figures. Therefore, the expected number of mutations per genome per replication cycle is $0.291$. This result implies that, on average, a newly synthesized HIV genome contains approximately $0.291$ point mutations, or roughly one new mutation for every three to four replication events.\n\nThe final task is to explain how this mutational burden shapes the emergence of antiretroviral resistance. This explanation rests on the interplay between stochastic mutation and selection.\nFirst, the process of mutation is stochastic. The value $E[X] = 0.291$ is an average. The actual number of mutations in any single new virion follows a binomial distribution, $B(L, p)$, which can be approximated by a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda = Lp = 0.291$. While many new genomes may have zero mutations, some will have one, two, or more.\nSecond, the scale of HIV replication is immense. In an untreated individual, it is estimated that $10^9$ to $10^{10}$ new virions are produced daily. The total number of new mutations introduced into the viral population per day is the product of the number of replications and the expected mutations per replication. This yields roughly ($10^{10}$ virions/day) $\\times$ ($0.291$ mutations/virion) $\\approx 3 \\times 10^9$ new mutations per day across the entire population.\nDue to this high rate of mutation generation, the HIV population within a host is not a monolithic entity of a single genotype. Instead, it exists as a highly heterogeneous \"quasispecies\"—a cloud of genetically distinct but related variants. This vast standing genetic variation is the raw material for evolution.\nWhen an antiretroviral drug is introduced, it imposes a powerful selective pressure. The drug effectively inhibits the replication of the wild-type and other susceptible viruses. However, within the vast quasispecies, there is a finite probability that some viral genomes, purely by chance, harbor one or more pre-existing mutations that confer a degree of resistance to the drug. These mutations might, for example, alter the drug's target enzyme (like reverse transcriptase or protease) in such a way that the drug no longer binds effectively, but the enzyme retains sufficient function for viral replication.\nWhile these resistant variants may have been rare and potentially less fit than the wild-type in the absence of the drug, they are the only ones with a significant replicative capacity in the presence of the drug. They are \"selected for\". Their progeny inherit the resistance-conferring mutations, and through subsequent rounds of replication and further mutation, the population rapidly evolves. The once-rare resistant strain can become the dominant genotype, leading to clinical treatment failure.\nIn summary, the high expected mutational burden, $Lp$, ensures that a massive reservoir of genetic diversity is constantly generated. This allows the viral population to stochastically \"explore\" the sequence space, inevitably producing variants that can survive the selective pressure created by antiretroviral therapy, thus leading to the rapid emergence of drug resistance.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.291}\n$$", "id": "4964466"}, {"introduction": "The constant struggle between viral replication and the host's immune response can be tracked through clinical markers, with the CD4 T-lymphocyte count being the most critical.
