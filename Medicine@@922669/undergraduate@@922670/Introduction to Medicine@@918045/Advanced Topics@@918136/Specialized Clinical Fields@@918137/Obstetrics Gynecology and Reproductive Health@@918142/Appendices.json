This model, treating each cycle as an independent Bernoulli trial, is a cornerstone of demographic and reproductive health studies. The term 'per-cycle fecundability' is standard terminology, and the value $p=0.2$ is a realistic average for a healthy young couple. The model is a simplification (fecundability can vary with age and other factors) but is not scientifically unsound; it is a valid first-order approximation.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is mathematically well-posed. It provides all necessary parameters ($p$, $n$) and assumptions (constant probability, independence) to determine a unique solution.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal, precise, and objective, using standard terminology from probability theory and reproductive medicine.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the General Expression\n\nLet $C_i$ be the event that conception occurs in cycle $i$, for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, n$.\nAccording to the problem statement, the probability of this event is constant for each cycle:\n$$P(C_i) = p$$\nThe event that conception does not occur in cycle $i$ is the complement of $C_i$, denoted $C_i^c$. Based on the axioms of probability, its probability is:\n$$P(C_i^c) = 1 - P(C_i) = 1 - p$$\nWe are asked to find the probability of the event $A$, where $A$ is the occurrence of at least one conception within $n$ cycles. This can be expressed as the union of the events $C_i$:\n$$A = C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup C_n$$\nCalculating the probability of a union of non-mutually exclusive events can be complex. A more direct approach is to consider the complement of $A$, denoted $A^c$. The event $A^c$ is that *no* conceptions occur in any of the $n$ cycles. This means that for every cycle from $1$ to $n$, no conception occurred. This can be written as the intersection of the individual non-conception events:\n$$A^c = C_1^c \\cap C_2^c \\cap \\dots \\cap C_n^c$$\nThe problem states that the outcomes of different cycles are independent. By the definition of independence, the probability of the intersection of independent events is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(A^c) = P(C_1^c) \\times P(C_2^c) \\times \\dots \\times P(C_n^c)$$\nSince $P(C_i^c) = 1 - p$ for all $i$, the expression becomes:\n$$P(A^c) = (1 - p) \\times (1 - p) \\times \\dots \\times (1 - p) \\quad (n \\text{ times})$$\n$$P(A^c) = (1 - p)^n$$\nThe probability of the event $A$ (at least one conception) is related to the probability of its complement $A^c$ by the axiom $P(A) + P(A^c) = 1$. Therefore:\n$$P(A) = 1 - P(A^c)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(A^c)$, we arrive at the general expression for the probability of at least one conception within $n$ cycles:\n$$P(A) = 1 - (1 - p)^n$$\n\n### Evaluation for Specific Values\n\nWe are given the specific values $p = 0.2$ and $n = 6$. Substituting these into the derived expression:\n$$P(A) = 1 - (1 - 0.2)^6$$\n$$P(A) = 1 - (0.8)^6$$\nWe now compute the value of $(0.8)^6$:\n$$(0.8)^2 = 0.64$$\n$$(0.8)^3 = 0.64 \\times 0.8 = 0.512$$\n$$(0.8)^4 = (0.64)^2 = 0.4096$$\n$$(0.8)^6 = (0.8)^4 \\times (0.8)^2 = 0.4096 \\times 0.64$$\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$0.4096 \\times 0.64 = 0.262144$$\nNow, substitute this value back into the probability expression:\n$$P(A) = 1 - 0.262144$$\n$$P(A) = 0.737856$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. The first four significant figures are $7, 3, 7, 8$. The fifth significant figure is $5$, which requires rounding up the fourth digit.\n$$P(A) \\approx 0.7379$$\nThis is the final numerical probability.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.7379}\n$$", "id": "4972200"}, {"introduction": "Modern prenatal screening has revolutionized obstetric care, but interpreting the results requires a firm grasp of statistics.

We are instructed to derive the result from first principles, using the fundamental definitions of sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, conditional probability, and the law of total probability.\n\nFirst, let us define the relevant events and translate the given information into the language of probability theory.\nLet $D$ be the event that a fetus has trisomy $21$ (the \"disease\" is present).\nLet $D^c$ be the event that a fetus does not have trisomy $21$ (the \"disease\" is absent).\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the screening test result is positive.\nLet $T^-$ be the event that the screening test result is negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n1.  The prevalence of trisomy $21$ is $1:500$. This is the prior probability of a fetus having the condition, $P(D)$.\n    $$P(D) = \\frac{1}{500} = 0.002$$\n2.  The sensitivity of the test is $0.99$. Sensitivity is the probability of a positive test result given that the disease is present.\n    $$P(T^+|D) = 0.99$$\n3.  The specificity of the test is $0.995$. Specificity is the probability of a negative test result given that the disease is absent.\n    $$P(T^-|D^c) = 0.995$$\n\nOur objective is to find the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), which is the probability that a fetus truly has trisomy $21$ given that the screening test result is positive. In probabilistic notation, we need to find $P(D|T^+)$.\n\nWe begin with the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\nwhere $P(D \\cap T^+)$ is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive.\n\nTo evaluate the numerator, $P(D \\cap T^+)$, we can use the definition of conditional probability for $P(T^+|D)$:\n$$P(T^+|D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(D)}$$\nBy rearranging this formula, we can express the numerator in terms of the given sensitivity and prevalence:\n$$P(D \\cap T^+) = P(T^+|D) P(D)$$\nThis product represents the probability of a true positive result within the entire population.\n\nNext, we evaluate the denominator, $P(T^+)$, which is the overall probability of a positive test result. We can find this using the law of total probability. The event $T^+$ can be partitioned into two mutually exclusive events:\n1.  The fetus has the disease and the test is positive ($D \\cap T^+$).\n2.  The fetus does not have the disease and the test is positive ($D^c \\cap T^+$).\nThe probability of $T^+$ is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n$$P(T^+) = P(D \\cap T^+) + P(D^c \\cap T^+)$$\nWe have already found an expression for the first term, $P(D \\cap T^+) = P(T^+|D) P(D)$.\nThe second term, $P(D^c \\cap T^+)$, can be similarly re-expressed using the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(D^c \\cap T^+) = P(T^+|D^c) P(D^c)$$\nThis product represents the probability of a false positive result within the entire population.\n\nTo find the values of $P(D^c)$ and $P(T^+|D^c)$, we use the provided information. The probability of not having the disease, $P(D^c)$, is the complement of the prevalence:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.002 = 0.998$$\nThe probability $P(T^+|D^c)$ is the false positive rate, which is the complement of the specificity, $P(T^-|D^c)$:\n$$P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - 0.995 = 0.005$$\n\nNow we can write the full expression for the denominator, $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D) P(D) + P(T^+|D^c) P(D^c)$$\n\nBy substituting the expressions for the numerator and the denominator back into our initial formula for $P(D|T^+)$, we obtain Bayes' theorem as applied to this problem:\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D)}{P(T^+|D) P(D) + P(T^+|D^c) P(D^c)}$$\nThis equation correctly expresses the PPV in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence, as derived from first principles.\n\nNow, we proceed with the numerical calculation. Substituting the given values into our derived formula for the PPV:\n$$PPV = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{(0.99)(0.002)}{(0.99)(0.002) + (0.005)(0.998)}$$\nLet's calculate the individual components:\nThe numerator is the probability of a true positive:\n$$P(\\text{True Positive}) = (0.99)(0.002) = 0.00198$$\nThe denominator is the sum of the probability of a true positive and the probability of a false positive:\n$$P(\\text{False Positive}) = (0.005)(0.998) = 0.00499$$\nSo, the total probability of a positive test is:\n$$P(T^+) = 0.00198 + 0.00499 = 0.00697$$\nFinally, the PPV is the ratio of true positives to all positives:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.00198}{0.00697} \\approx 0.2840745911...$$\nThe problem requires the result to be expressed as a decimal rounded to $4$ significant figures.\nThe first four significant figures are $2$, $8$, $4$, and $0$. The fifth digit is $7$, so we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$PPV \\approx 0.2841$$\nThis result means that even with a highly sensitive and specific test, for a positive result in a low-prevalence condition, there is only approximately a $28.41\\%$ chance that the fetus actually has trisomy $21$.
