The solution will be constructed by rigorously applying the provided definitions and facts.\n\nThe problem defines the Developmental Readiness Index, $R$, as:\n$$\nR \\equiv \\frac{A_{c}}{\\sqrt{A_{s}\\,A_{b}}}\n$$\nwhere $A_{c}$ is the child's corrected age in months, and $A_{s}$ and $A_{b}$ are the median ages for specific developmental milestones.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the child's corrected age, $A_{c}$. The calculation proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Determine the degree of prematurity.**\n    Term gestation is defined as $40$ weeks. The child was born at a gestational age of $30$ weeks. The number of weeks the child was born before reaching term gestation is the difference between these two values. Let this prematurity in weeks be denoted by $P$.\n    $$\n    P = (\\text{Term gestation}) - (\\text{Birth gestational age}) = 40 \\text{ weeks} - 30 \\text{ weeks} = 10 \\text{ weeks}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Convert the chronological age to weeks.**\n    The child's chronological age is given as $10$ months. The problem specifies using the conversion factor of $1 \\text{ month} = 4 \\text{ weeks}$. Let the chronological age in months be $A_{chrono,mo}$ and in weeks be $A_{chrono,wk}$.\n    $$\n    A_{chrono,wk} = A_{chrono,mo} \\times \\left(\\frac{4 \\text{ weeks}}{1 \\text{ month}}\\right) = 10 \\text{ months} \\times 4 \\frac{\\text{weeks}}{\\text{month}} = 40 \\text{ weeks}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Calculate the corrected age in weeks.**\n    The corrected age is defined as the chronological age in weeks minus the number of weeks of prematurity. Let the corrected age in weeks be $A_{corr,wk}$.\n    $$\n    A_{corr,wk} = A_{chrono,wk} - P = 40 \\text{ weeks} - 10 \\text{ weeks} = 30 \\text{ weeks}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Convert the corrected age to months.**\n    The formula for $R$ requires the corrected age in months, denoted as $A_{c}$. We use the same conversion factor.\n    $$\n    A_{c} = A_{corr,wk} \\div \\left(\\frac{4 \\text{ weeks}}{1 \\text{ month}}\\right) = 30 \\text{ weeks} \\div 4 \\frac{\\text{weeks}}{\\text{month}} = 7.5 \\text{ months}\n    $$\n\nNow that $A_{c}$ is determined, we can compute the index $R$. The problem provides the median ages for the milestones:\n-   Independent sitting, $A_{s} = 7 \\text{ months}$.\n-   Canonical babbling, $A_{b} = 7 \\text{ months}$.\n\nThe denominator of the expression for $R$ is the geometric mean of these two ages.\n$$\n\\sqrt{A_{s}\\,A_{b}} = \\sqrt{7 \\text{ months} \\times 7 \\text{ months}} = \\sqrt{49 \\text{ months}^2} = 7 \\text{ months}\n$$\n\nFinally, substitute the values of $A_{c}$ and the geometric mean into the definition of $R$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{A_{c}}{\\sqrt{A_{s}\\,A_{b}}} = \\frac{7.5 \\text{ months}}{7 \\text{ months}} = \\frac{7.5}{7}\n$$\nThe value is a unitless ratio.

Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$PPV = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test, found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$P(T^+) = (\\text{Sens} \\times p) + ((1 - \\text{Spec}) \\times (1 - p))$$\nTherefore, the full expression for $PPV$ is:\n$$PPV = \\frac{\\text{Sens} \\times p}{(\\text{Sens} \\times p) + ((1 - \\text{Spec}) \\times (1 - p))}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.80 \\times 0.10}{(0.80 \\times 0.10) + (0.15 \\times 0.90)} = \\frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.135} = \\frac{0.08}{0.215} \\approx 0.372093$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $PPV = 0.3721$.\n\nThe Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$) is the probability that a child does not have GDD given a negative test result, $P(D^c|T^-)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$NPV = P(D^c|T^-) = \\frac{P(T^-|D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c) + P(T^-|D)P(D)$$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$P(T^-) = (\\text{Spec} \\times (1 - p)) + ((1 - \\text{Sens}) \\times p)$$\nTherefore, the full expression for $NPV$ is:\n$$NPV = \\frac{\\text{Spec} \\times (1 - p)}{(\\text{Spec} \\times (1 - p)) + ((1 - \\text{Sens}) \\times p)}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.85 \\times 0.90}{(0.85 \\times 0.90) + (0.20 \\times 0.10)} = \\frac{0.765}{0.765 + 0.02} = \\frac{0.765}{0.785} \\approx 0.974522$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $NPV = 0.9745$.\n\n**Part 2: Interpretation of Action**\n\nThe clinic's policy is to refer to Early Intervention (EI) if the $PPV$ is at least $0.30$. Our calculated $PPV$ is $0.3721$. Since $0.3721 \\ge 0.30$, the appropriate action for a child with a positive screen is immediate referral to EI.\n\n**Part 3: Derivation and Calculation of Minimal Prevalence $p^{\\ast}$**\n\nWe need to find the prevalence, denoted $p^{\\ast}$, for which the $PPV$ is exactly equal to the threshold $PPV_{\\text{thresh}} = 0.30$. We set the symbolic expression for $PPV$ equal to this threshold, with $p = p^{\\ast}$.\n$$PPV_{\\text{thresh}} = \\frac{\\text{Sens} \\times p^{\\ast}}{(\\text{Sens} \\times p^{\\ast}) + ((1 - \\text{Spec}) \\times (1 - p^{\\ast}))}$$\nTo solve for $p^{\\ast}$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$PPV_{\\text{thresh}} [(\\text{Sens} \\times p^{\\ast}) + (1 - \\text{Spec})(1 - p^{\\ast})] = \\text{Sens} \\times p^{\\ast}$$\n$$PPV_{\\text{thresh}} \\cdot \\text{Sens} \\cdot p^{\\ast} + PPV_{\\text{thresh}}(1 - \\text{Spec}) - PPV_{\\text{thresh}}(1 - \\text{Spec})p^{\\ast} = \\text{Sens} \\cdot p^{\\ast}$$\nGather all terms containing $p^{\\ast}$ on one side:\n$$PPV_{\\text{thresh}}(1 - \\text{Spec}) = \\text{Sens} \\cdot p^{\\ast} - PPV_{\\text{thresh}} \\cdot \\text{Sens} \\cdot p^{\\ast} + PPV_{\\text{thresh}}(1 - \\text{Spec})p^{\\ast}$$\nFactor out $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$PPV_{\\text{thresh}}(1 - \\text{Spec}) = p^{\\ast} [\\text{Sens} - PPV_{\\text{thresh}} \\cdot \\text{Sens} + PPV_{\\text{thresh}}(1 - \\text{Spec})]$$\n$$PPV_{\\text{thresh}}(1 - \\text{Spec}) = p^{\\ast} [\\text{Sens}(1 - PPV_{\\text{thresh}}) + (1 - \\text{Spec})PPV_{\\text{thresh}}]$$\nIsolating $p^{\\ast}$ gives the symbolic solution:\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{PPV_{\\text{thresh}}(1 - \\text{Spec})}{\\text{Sens}(1 - PPV_{\\text{thresh}}) + (1 - \\text{Spec})PPV_{\\text{thresh}}}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $p^{\\ast}$ using $\\text{Sens} = 0.80$, $\\text{Spec} = 0.85$, and $PPV_{\\text{thresh}} = 0.30$.\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.30(1 - 0.85)}{0.80(1 - 0.30) + (1 - 0.85)(0.30)}$$\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.30(0.15)}{0.80(0.70) + (0.15)(0.30)}$$\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.045}{0.56 + 0.045}$$\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.045}{0.605} \\approx 0.074380165$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the minimal prevalence is $p^{\\ast} = 0.07438$.\nThis is the final answer requested.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.07438}$$", "id": "4976065"}, {"introduction": "The pinnacle of clinical diagnostics lies not in isolated facts but in synthesis—recognizing the meaningful pattern within a collection of symptoms and milestones.

The solution will proceed by following the requested line of reasoning.\n\n### **Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe problem dictates a three-step reasoning process to arrive at the diagnosis.\n\n**1. Analysis of Developmental Domains: Global vs. Domain-Specific Delay**\n\n- **First Principle:** Child development is assessed across multiple domains: gross motor, fine motor, language/communication, and social/personal. A global developmental delay involves significant delays ($\\geq 2$ standard deviations from the mean) in two or more of these domains. A domain-specific delay is confined to a single domain (or a related subset of domains, like motor skills).\n- **Application to Case:**\n    - **Motor Domains (Gross and Fine):** There is a clear delay. Independent walking at 20 months is significantly delayed (typical range 12-15 months; red flag at >18 months). Difficulty with pincer grasp at 12 months and ongoing trouble with small objects at 24 months constitutes a significant fine motor delay.\n    - **Language/Social Domains:** These are explicitly described as \"typical.\" The child uses 2-word phrases (age-appropriate for 24 months), shows joint attention, and engages in pretend play. These milestones are on track.\n- **Conclusion:** The delays are confined to the motor domains (both gross and fine). The language and social domains are spared. Therefore, this is an **isolated motor delay**, not a global developmental delay.\n\n**2. Neurological Localization: Upper Motor Neuron (UMN) vs. Lower Motor Neuron (LMN)**\n\n- **First Principle:** Motor pathways can be divided into UMNs (originating in the cerebral cortex and brainstem, synapsing on LMNs) and LMNs (originating in the spinal cord anterior horn or cranial nerve nuclei, terminating at the neuromuscular junction). Lesions in these systems produce distinct clinical signs.\n    - **UMN lesions** cause spasticity (velocity-dependent increase in tone), hyperreflexia, and weakness.\n    - **LMN lesions** cause hypotonia/flaccidity, hyporeflexia/areflexia, fasciculations, and muscle atrophy, along with weakness.\n- **Application to Case:** The child presents with delayed motor skills, which can be interpreted as a form of weakness or poor motor control (\"clumsiness\"). The critical information lies in the negative findings. The problem states there is \"no report of persistent toe-walking.\" Persistent toe-walking is often associated with spasticity of the calf muscles (a UMN sign). The absence of this, and the lack of any mention of increased tone or scissoring of the legs, argues against a primary UMN disorder like spastic cerebral palsy. The clinical picture is more consistent with weakness without spasticity, which points towards an LMN or primary muscle pathology.\n\n**3. Characterizing Weakness: Proximal vs. Distal**\n\n- **First Principle:** Within LMN and muscle disorders, the pattern of weakness provides crucial diagnostic clues.\n    - **Proximal weakness** affects muscles of the shoulders and hips. It impairs activities like rising from the floor (Gowers' sign), climbing stairs, and running. It is the hallmark of myopathies (e.g., muscular dystrophies).\n    - **Distal weakness** affects muscles of the hands and feet. It impairs fine motor tasks, grip, and can cause foot drop, leading to an unstable, high-stepping gait. It is the hallmark of peripheral neuropathies.\n- **Application to Case:**\n    - The child has a prominent **fine motor delay**. Difficulty with pincer grasp and manipulating small objects at 24 months directly reflects weakness or incoordination of the intrinsic muscles of the hand, a classic sign of **distal** pathology.\n    - The gross motor delay (walking at 20 months) is also consistent with distal weakness. Weakness of the distal lower leg muscles (e.g., tibialis anterior) causes foot drop and ankle instability, making balance difficult and delaying the onset of independent walking.\n    - Conversely, proximal strength appears relatively preserved. The child sat unsupported at 7 months, which is well within the normal range and relies on good axial and proximal trunk control. Furthermore, the problem states \"no report of calf enlargement,\" arguing against the pseudohypertrophy seen in the proximal myopathy Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\n- **Synthesis:** The combined pattern of prominent distal weakness in the hands (poor fine motor skills) and delayed walking consistent with distal weakness in the legs strongly suggests a **peripheral neuropathy**.\n\n### **Evaluation of Options**\n\nBased on the derived conclusion that the child most likely has an isolated motor delay caused by a distal LMN process (i.e., a peripheral neuropathy), we can evaluate the options.\n\n**A. Spastic diplegic cerebral palsy**\nThis is a UMN disorder characterized by spasticity, primarily in the lower limbs. The clinical picture lacks any signs of spasticity and the birth history is unremarkable.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)**\nThis is a primary myopathy causing progressive proximal weakness. The presentation in this case is dominated by distal (fine motor) impairment, and a key sign of DMD (calf enlargement) is explicitly absent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT)**\nThis is the most common inherited peripheral neuropathy. It characteristically causes progressive, length-dependent (i.e., distal) muscle weakness and atrophy. This leads to foot drop and delayed walking, as well as weakness of the hand intrinsic muscles, causing severe fine motor impairment. This diagnosis perfectly matches the entire clinical picture: isolated motor delay, absence of UMN signs, and a distal pattern of weakness.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Developmental coordination disorder (DCD)**\nThis is a diagnosis of motor clumsiness that is not better explained by another medical condition. While this child has poor coordination, the specific pattern of distal weakness is highly suggestive of an underlying neuromuscular disease (CMT). DCD is a diagnosis of exclusion and is not the primary underlying etiology when a specific neuropathology is evident.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)**\nThis is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined by deficits in social communication and the presence of restricted, repetitive behaviors. The problem explicitly states that the child's social and language skills are typical, which rules out this diagnosis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4976016"}]}
