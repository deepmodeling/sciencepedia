Myelination increases effective membrane resistance and decreases effective capacitance, promoting saltatory conduction between nodes of Ranvier; within a class of axons that share similar biophysical properties (for example, similar g-ratio and internode architecture among myelinated fibers, or similar channel density among unmyelinated fibers), empirical evidence shows that conduction velocity $v$ scales approximately linearly with diameter $d$.\n\nYou are given two calibration points based on well-established physiological measurements for human peripheral nerves:\n- A myelinated motor axon (classified as A–alpha) with diameter $d = 10\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ conducts at $v = 60\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n- An unmyelinated axon (classified as C fiber) with diameter $d = 2\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ conducts at $v = 1\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n\nAssuming that within each class (myelinated A–alpha and unmyelinated C) the conduction velocity $v$ is proportional to the diameter $d$ with a class-specific proportionality constant, use the above calibration points to determine those constants and then estimate the conduction velocities for:\n- an A–alpha axon with $d = 15\\,\\mu\\text{m}$,\n- and a C fiber with $d = 1\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nFinally, compute the ratio $v_{\\text{A}\\text{–}\\alpha}/v_{\\text{C}}$ for these two axons.
