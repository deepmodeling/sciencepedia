All provided values—total atmospheric pressure at sea level ($P_B=760\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$), the fraction of inspired oxygen ($F_{I\\text{O}_2}=0.21$), and the partial pressure of water vapor in saturated air at body temperature ($P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}=47\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$)—are standard and factually correct within the context of respiratory physiology. The problem asks for a derivation based on fundamental physical laws (Dalton's law) and definitions, which is a valid scientific task. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to determine the partial pressure of inspired oxygen ($P_{I\\text{O}_2}$) in the airways after the air has been fully humidified. This calculation rests on two core principles: the definition of a partial pressure and Dalton's law of partial pressures.\n\nDalton's law states that the total pressure of a mixture of non-reacting gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual component gases. In the humidified air within the respiratory tract, the total pressure is the ambient atmospheric pressure, $P_B$. This total pressure is the sum of the partial pressure of water vapor, $P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$, and the sum of the partial pressures of all the dry gases (oxygen, nitrogen, etc.), which we can denote as $P_{\\text{dry}}$.\n$$P_B = P_{\\text{dry}} + P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$$\n\nThe problem provides the values for total atmospheric pressure, $P_B = 760\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, and the partial pressure of water vapor in fully saturated air at body temperature, $P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}} = 47\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$. We can rearrange the equation to find the total pressure exerted by the dry gas components alone in this humidified mixture:\n$$P_{\\text{dry}} = P_B - P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$$\n\nThe partial pressure of any single gas component, such as oxygen, in a mixture is defined as the product of its mole fraction ($F$) and the total pressure of the mixture. When considering the humidified air, it is crucial to recognize that the fraction of inspired oxygen, $F_{I\\text{O}_2} = 0.21$, is the fraction of oxygen *relative to the total volume of dry air*. Humidification is the process of adding water vapor to this dry air; it does not change the proportional composition of the dry gases themselves.\n\nTherefore, the partial pressure of inspired oxygen, $P_{I\\text{O}_2}$, in the humidified air is the fraction of inspired oxygen, $F_{I\\text{O}_2}$, multiplied by the total pressure of the dry gas component, $P_{\\text{dry}}$.\n\nThe expression for $P_{I\\text{O}_2}$ is derived by substituting the expression for $P_{\\text{dry}}$:\n$$P_{I\\text{O}_2} = F_{I\\text{O}_2} \\times P_{\\text{dry}}$$\n$$P_{I\\text{O}_2} = F_{I\\text{O}_2} \\times (P_B - P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}})$$\n\nThis is the general expression for the partial pressure of inspired oxygen in humidified tracheal air.

This requires the calculation of the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen ($P_{A\\text{O}_2}$) using the Alveolar Gas Equation.\n\n**1. Calculate the Inspired Partial Pressure of Oxygen ($P_{I\\text{O}_2}$)**\nThe partial pressure of inspired oxygen is the fraction of oxygen in the air after it has been fully saturated with water vapor in the upper airways. It is calculated as:\n$$P_{I\\text{O}_2} = F_{I\\text{O}_2} \\times (P_B - P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}})$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P_{I\\text{O}_2} = 0.21 \\times (760 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg} - 47 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg})$$\n$$P_{I\\text{O}_2} = 0.21 \\times 713 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$$\n$$P_{I\\text{O}_2} = 149.73 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$$\n\n**2. Calculate the Alveolar Partial Pressure of Oxygen ($P_{A\\text{O}_2}$)**\nThe Alveolar Gas Equation relates the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli to the inspired oxygen pressure and the alveolar carbon dioxide pressure. The equation is:\n$$P_{A\\text{O}_2} = P_{I\\text{O}_2} - \\frac{P_{A\\text{CO}_2}}{R}$$\nIn clinical practice, the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide ($P_{A\\text{CO}_2}$) is assumed to be equal to the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide ($P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$), as $CO_2$ rapidly equilibrates across the alveolar-capillary membrane.\nTherefore, we use $P_{A\\text{CO}_2} \\approx P_{a\\text{CO}_2} = 80 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$.\nSubstituting the values into the equation:\n$$P_{A\\text{O}_2} = 149.73 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg} - \\frac{80 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}}{0.8}$$\n$$P_{A\\text{O}_2} = 149.73 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg} - 100 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$$\n$$P_{A\\text{O}_2} = 49.73 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$$\n\n**3. Calculate the Alveolar-to-Arterial Oxygen Gradient ($A\\!-\\!a\\,\\text{O}_2$)**\nThe $A\\!-\\!a\\,\\text{O}_2$ gradient is the difference between the calculated alveolar oxygen and the measured arterial oxygen.\n$$A\\!-\\!a\\,\\text{O}_2 = P_{A\\text{O}_2} - P_{a\\text{O}_2}$$\nUsing our calculated $P_{A\\text{O}_2}$ and the given $P_{a\\text{O}_2}$:\n$$A\\!-\\!a\\,\\text{O}_2 = 49.73 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg} - 48 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$$\n$$A\\!-\\!a\\,\\text{O}_2 = 1.73 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$$\n\n**4. Interpret the Results**\nThe patient presents with severe hypoxemia ($P_{a\\text{O}_2} = 48 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$) and severe hypercapnia ($P_{a\\text{CO}_2} = 80 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$). The high $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$ is pathognomonic for alveolar hypoventilation ($\\dot V_A$), meaning the patient is not moving enough air in and out of the alveoli to clear $CO_2$. This is consistent with the clinical signs of somnolence and shallow breathing.\n\nThe calculated $A\\!-\\!a\\,\\text{O}_2$ gradient is $1.73 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$. A normal $A\\!-\\!a\\,\\text{O}_2$ gradient for a young adult is typically less than $15 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$. An age-adjusted estimate for a normal gradient is $(\\text{Age}/4) + 4$. For a $28$-year-old patient, this would be $(28/4) + 4 = 11 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$. Our calculated value of $1.73 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$ is well within the normal range.\n\nA normal $A\\!-\\!a\\,\\text{O}_2$ gradient indicates that gas exchange across the alveolar-capillary membrane is efficient. The hypoxemia is therefore not caused by a problem within the lung parenchyma (like V/Q mismatch, shunt, or diffusion limitation), but rather by the failure to bring enough oxygen into the alveoli in the first place. The low alveolar oxygen ($P_{A\\text{O}_2} = 49.73 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$) directly leads to a low arterial oxygen ($P_{a\\text{O}_2} = 48 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$), with a minimal gradient between them. This confirms that alveolar hypoventilation is the primary physiological defect.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The findings indicate primary alveolar hypoventilation (reduced $\\dot V_A$), consistent with a near-normal $A\\!-\\!a\\,\\text{O}_2$ gradient.**\nThe patient has severe hypercapnia ($P_{a\\text{CO}_2} = 80 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$), a direct consequence of reduced alveolar ventilation. Our calculation yielded an $A\\!-\\!a\\,\\text{O}_2$ gradient of $1.73 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$, which is near-normal. This option accurately describes the pathophysiology.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The findings indicate ventilation-perfusion ($V/Q$) mismatch causing impaired gas exchange, consistent with a markedly elevated $A\\!-\\!a\\,\\text{O}_2$ gradient.**\nA significant $V/Q$ mismatch is a cause of impaired gas exchange and would indeed result in a markedly elevated $A\\!-\\!a\\,\\text{O}_2$ gradient. However, our calculated gradient is normal ($1.73 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$), not elevated.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The findings indicate diffusion limitation across the alveolar-capillary membrane, suggested by normal $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$ and elevated $A\\!-\\!a\\,\\text{O}_2$ gradient.**\nThis option fails on two counts. First, the patient's $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$ is $80 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$, which is severely elevated, not normal. Second, the calculated $A\\!-\\!a\\,\\text{O}_2$ gradient is normal, not elevated. Pure diffusion limitation is also less likely to cause such profound hypercapnia, as $CO_2$ is about $20$ times more diffusible than $O_2$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The findings indicate a significant right-to-left intrapulmonary shunt, supported by a near-zero $A\\!-\\!a\\,\\text{O}_2$ gradient.**\nThe premise of this option is fundamentally flawed. A significant right-to-left shunt, where deoxygenated blood bypasses ventilated alveoli, is a cause of a markedly *elevated* $A\\!-\\!a\\,\\text{O}_2$ gradient, not a near-zero one. Furthermore, the patient's calculated gradient is normal, not elevated as would be expected with a shunt.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4979880"}, {"introduction": "Beyond gas exchange, respiratory function depends on the mechanical properties of the lungs and airways.
