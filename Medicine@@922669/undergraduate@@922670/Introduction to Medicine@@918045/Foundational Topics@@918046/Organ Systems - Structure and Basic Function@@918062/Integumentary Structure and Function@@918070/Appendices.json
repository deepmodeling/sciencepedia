It is free from subjective or ambiguous phrasing.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution can be derived from the provided information.\n\n### Derivation of Rankings\n\n**(i) Ranking of Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL), $J$**\n\nAccording to Fick's first law for steady-state diffusion, the flux $J$ is constant.\n$$ J = -D \\frac{\\mathrm{d}C}{\\mathrm{d}x} $$\nSince $D$ is assumed constant, the concentration gradient $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}C}{\\mathrm{d}x}$ must also be constant. This implies a linear concentration profile across the stratum corneum. The gradient can be expressed as the total change in concentration over the thickness $L$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}C}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{C_e - C_i}{L} $$\nwhere $C_i$ is the concentration at the inner boundary ($x=0$) and $C_e$ is the concentration at the outer boundary ($x=L$). Substituting this into the expression for flux:\n$$ J = -D \\frac{C_e - C_i}{L} = D \\frac{C_i - C_e}{L} $$\nThe problem states that concentration is proportional to water activity: $C(x) = k \\cdot a(x)$. Thus, $C_i = k \\cdot a_i$ and $C_e = k \\cdot a_e$.\n$$ J = D \\frac{k a_i - k a_e}{L} = \\frac{Dk}{L} (a_i - a_e) $$\nThe term $\\frac{Dk}{L}$ is a positive constant across all three conditions. The inner water activity is also constant, $a_i \\approx 1.0$. Therefore, the magnitude of TEWL, $J$, is directly proportional to the difference in water activity across the stratum corneum, $(a_i - a_e)$.\n\nLet's compute this difference for each condition:\n- Ambient: $J_{\\text{ambient}} \\propto (1.0 - 0.40) = 0.60$\n- Humectant: $J_{\\text{humectant}} \\propto (1.0 - 0.85) = 0.15$\n- Occlusion: $J_{\\text{occlusion}} \\propto (1.0 - 0.95) = 0.05$\n\nComparing these values, the ranking for $J$ from greatest to least is:\nAmbient $>$ Humectant $>$ Occlusion.\n\n**(ii) Ranking of Corneocyte Swelling**\n\nThe problem states that increased hydration increases corneocyte size (swelling). The overall hydration of the stratum corneum is determined by the average water concentration, $\\bar{C}$, across its thickness. With a linear concentration profile $C(x)$, the average concentration is simply the arithmetic mean of the concentrations at the boundaries:\n$$ \\bar{C} = \\frac{C_i + C_e}{2} $$\nSince $C \\propto a$, the average water activity $\\bar{a}$ is also the arithmetic mean of the boundary activities:\n$$ \\bar{a} = \\frac{a_i + a_e}{2} $$\nGiven that $a_i \\approx 1.0$ is constant, the average hydration $\\bar{a}$ increases as the external water activity $a_e$ increases. Therefore, corneocyte swelling will be greatest for the condition with the highest $a_e$.\n\nLet's compare the $a_e$ values for the three conditions:\n- Ambient: $a_e = 0.40$\n- Humectant: $a_e = 0.85$\n- Occlusion: $a_e = 0.95$\n\nThe order of $a_e$ from greatest to least is Occlusion ($0.95$) $>$ Humectant ($0.85$) $>$ Ambient ($0.40$).\nThus, the ranking for the degree of corneocyte swelling from greatest to least is:\nOcclusion $>$ Humectant $>$ Ambient.\n\n**(iii) Ranking of Young's Modulus, $E$**\n\nThe problem states that increased hydration decreases the elastic stiffness (Young's modulus, $E$) of the stratum corneum. This means that $E$ is inversely related to the average hydration, $\\bar{a}$. We have already established the ranking for hydration (and thus swelling):\nHydration$_{\\text{occlusion}}$ > Hydration$_{\\text{humectant}}$ > Hydration$_{\\text{ambient}}$.\n\nSince $E$ is inversely proportional to hydration, the ranking for $E$ will be the exact reverse of the hydration ranking.\nThe ranking for Young's modulus, $E$, from greatest to least is:\nAmbient $>$ Humectant $>$ Occlusion.\n\n### Summary of Rankings\n1.  **TEWL ($J$):** Ambient $>$ Humectant $>$ Occlusion\n2.  **Corneocyte swelling:** Occlusion $>$ Humectant $>$ Ambient\n3.  **Young's modulus ($E$):** Ambient $>$ Humectant $>$ Occlusion\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n-   **A.

The scenario of applying sunscreen at half the recommended dose is well-documented and realistic.\n    5.  **Ill-Posed/Poorly Structured:** None. A unique solution can be derived from the given model.\n    6.  **Pseudo-Profound/Trivial:** None. The problem requires a correct application of the Beer-Lambert law in a non-linear context (square root relationship), which is a common point of misunderstanding.\n    7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability:** None.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It presents a scientifically grounded, well-posed model for analysis. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation\nThe core of the problem is to determine the effective transmittance of UVB radiation at half the standard application thickness ($d_0/2$) for a sunscreen with a labeled SPF of $50$.\n\n$1$. **Relate SPF to Transmittance:** The SPF is defined based on the erythemally-weighted dose. The problem states erythema is strongly UVB-weighted. Therefore, we can approximate the SPF as the inverse of the effective UVB transmittance, $\\bar{T}_{UVB}$, at the standard thickness $d_0$.\n$$SPF \\approx \\frac{1}{\\bar{T}_{UVB}(d_0)}$$\nFor an SPF of $50$, the effective transmittance at the standard thickness $d_0$ is:\n$$\\bar{T}_{UVB}(d_0) \\approx \\frac{1}{50} = 0.02$$\n\n$2$. **Apply the Beer-Lambert Law:** The Beer-Lambert law gives the transmittance $T$ as a function of thickness $d$ and absorption coefficient $\\alpha$: $T = \\exp(-\\alpha d)$. For a spectral band, we can use an effective absorption coefficient $\\bar{\\alpha}_{UVB}$.\nThe transmittance at the standard thickness $d_0$ is:\n$$\\bar{T}_{UVB}(d_0) = \\exp(-\\bar{\\alpha}_{UVB} \\cdot d_0) \\approx \\frac{1}{50}$$\nWe need to find the transmittance at half the thickness, $d = d_0/2$:\n$$\\bar{T}_{UVB}(d_0/2) = \\exp(-\\bar{\\alpha}_{UVB} \\cdot (d_0/2))$$\nThis can be rewritten using the properties of exponents:\n$$\\bar{T}_{UVB}(d_0/2) = \\left(\\exp(-\\bar{\\alpha}_{UVB} \\cdot d_0)\\right)^{1/2} = \\left(\\bar{T}_{UVB}(d_0)\\right)^{1/2}$$\n\n$3$. **Calculate Transmittance at Half Thickness:** Substituting the value for $\\bar{T}_{UVB}(d_0)$:\n$$\\bar{T}_{UVB}(d_0/2) \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{50}\\right)^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{50}}$$\nTo evaluate this numerically:\n$$\\sqrt{50} = \\sqrt{25 \\times 2} = 5\\sqrt{2} \\approx 5 \\times 1.4142 = 7.071$$\nTherefore, the transmittance at half thickness is:\n$$\\bar{T}_{UVB}(d_0/2) \\approx \\frac{1}{7.071} \\approx 0.1414$$\nThis corresponds to a transmittance of approximately $14.14\\%$.\n\n$4$. **Relate Transmittance to Vitamin D Synthesis:** The rate of previtamin D$_3$ photolysis, $R$, is given as $R \\propto \\int I_0(\\lambda)\\,T(\\lambda)\\,S_D(\\lambda)\\,d\\lambda$. The action spectrum for vitamin D synthesis, $S_D(\\lambda)$, is non-zero only in the UVB range. Therefore, the rate of synthesis is determined by the transmittance of UVB photons. The rate of synthesis relative to bare skin (where $T(\\lambda)=1$) is the effective UVB transmittance.\n$$\\frac{R(d=d_0/2)}{R(d=0)} = \\frac{\\int_{UVB} I_0(\\lambda) \\bar{T}_{UVB}(d_0/2) S_D(\\lambda) d\\lambda}{\\int_{UVB} I_0(\\lambda) S_D(\\lambda) d\\lambda} = \\bar{T}_{UVB}(d_0/2) \\approx 14\\%$$\nThis result applies to both sunscreens X and Y. The problem states their UVB absorption characteristics are effectively the same. Their difference lies in UVA filtering, which is irrelevant for vitamin D synthesis as per the given action spectrum $S_D(\\lambda)$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Approximately $2\\%$ of baseline for both X and Y, because SPF $50$ implies $1/50$ UVB transmission regardless of thickness or spectrum.**\nThis reasoning is flawed. The $1/50$ (or $2\\%$) transmission is valid only at the standard thickness $d_0$. The relationship between thickness and transmittance is exponential (Beer-Lambert law), not linear. Halving the thickness increases transmission to $\\sqrt{1/50} \\approx 14\\%$, not $2\\%$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Approximately $14\\%$ of baseline for both X and Y, because halving thickness reduces absorbance per Beer–Lambert, and UVA filtering does not alter vitamin D photolysis.**\nThis option correctly applies the Beer-Lambert law. Halving the thickness ($d$) halves the absorbance ($A = \\alpha d$), and since transmittance $T = \\exp(-\\text{const} \\cdot A)$, the new transmittance is the square root of the original. The calculation $(1/50)^{1/2} \\approx 14\\%$ is correct. It also correctly states that UVA filtering is irrelevant to vitamin D synthesis and that the result is the same for both products. This matches the derivation precisely.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Approximately $14\\%$ for X but higher (for example about $30\\%$) for Y, because stronger UVA blocking in Y increases SPF without reducing UVB transmission, thereby allowing more UVB through at half thickness.**\nThis option's reasoning is contradictory to the problem statement. It is given that both sunscreens have SPF $50$ and that their UVB attenuation is \"effectively the same\". Therefore, their impact on UVB-driven vitamin D synthesis must be the same. The premise in this option that Y allows more UVB through is inconsistent with the given information.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. No meaningful reduction in vitamin D photolysis for either product, because UVA, not UVB, drives the previtamin D$_3$ photochemical reaction.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect according to the problem description, which explicitly and correctly states that previtamin D$_3$ synthesis is driven by UVB radiation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Below $2\\%$ of baseline at half thickness, because the erythemal weighting is nonlinear and the SPF increases as thickness decreases.**\nThis option contains two incorrect claims. First, reducing sunscreen thickness *decreases* protection, so the effective SPF would decrease, not increase. For example, the effective SPF at half thickness would be $\\sqrt{50} \\approx 7$, not greater than $50$. Second, decreasing thickness must *increase* transmission. Since transmission is $\\approx 2\\%$ at full thickness, it must be greater than $2\\%$ at half thickness, not below it.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4966795"}]}
