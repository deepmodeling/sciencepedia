It is scientifically grounded in the principles of renal physiology, specifically the Starling forces governing glomerular filtration. It is well-posed, providing sufficient information and clear objectives to derive a unique solution under standard physiological assumptions. The language is objective and the parameters are dimensionally consistent and physically realistic.\n\n### Step 1: Derivation of the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) Expression\n\nThe process of glomerular filtration, where fluid and solutes are filtered from the glomerular capillaries into Bowman's space, is governed by the principles of transcapillary fluid exchange. The net rate of fluid movement is described by the Starling equation. For a single capillary, the fluid flux, $J_v$, is given by:\n$$J_v = k_f [ (P_c - P_i) - \\sigma (\\pi_c - \\pi_i) ]$$\nwhere $k_f$ is the capillary filtration coefficient, $P_c$ and $P_i$ are the hydrostatic pressures in the capillary and interstitial fluid, respectively, $\\pi_c$ and $\\pi_i$ are the corresponding colloid osmotic (oncotic) pressures, and $\\sigma$ is the reflection coefficient for the solute creating the osmotic pressure (primarily plasma proteins).\n\nTo find the whole-kidney Glomerular Filtration Rate ($GFR$), we adapt this equation to the specific context of all glomeruli in both kidneys.\n1.  The total fluid flux, $J_v$, becomes the whole-kidney $GFR$.\n2.  The filtration coefficient, $k_f$, is replaced by the whole-kidney filtration coefficient, $K_f$, which is the product of the intrinsic hydraulic conductivity of the glomerular capillaries and their total surface area.\n3.  The capillary hydrostatic pressure, $P_c$, becomes the glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure, $P_{GC}$.\n4.  The interstitial hydrostatic pressure, $P_i$, becomes the hydrostatic pressure in Bowman's space, $P_{BS}$.\n5.  The capillary oncotic pressure, $\\pi_c$, becomes the glomerular capillary oncotic pressure, $\\pi_{GC}$.\n6.  The interstitial oncotic pressure, $\\pi_i$, becomes the oncotic pressure in Bowman's space, $\\pi_{BS}$.\n7.  The reflection coefficient, $\\sigma$, is applied to the plasma proteins at the glomerular filtration barrier.\n\nSubstituting these specific terms, we derive the general expression for $GFR$:\n$$GFR = K_f [ (P_{GC} - P_{BS}) - \\sigma (\\pi_{GC} - \\pi_{BS}) ]$$\nHere, $(P_{GC} - P_{BS})$ represents the net hydrostatic pressure gradient favoring filtration, while $\\sigma (\\pi_{GC} - \\pi_{BS})$ represents the effective oncotic pressure gradient opposing filtration. The term within the brackets is the Net Filtration Pressure ($P_{UF}$).\n\n### Step 2: Physiologic Assumptions for Simplification in a Healthy Adult\n\nIn a healthy adult with normal renal function, the general expression for $GFR$ can be simplified based on two key physiological assumptions regarding the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier.\n\n1.  **Negligible Oncotic Pressure in Bowman's Space**: The glomerular filtration barrier, composed of the fenestrated endothelium, glomerular basement membrane, and podocyte slit diaphragms, is almost completely impermeable to large plasma proteins such as albumin. Consequently, the filtrate entering Bowman's space is virtually protein-free. Since oncotic pressure is generated by these proteins, the oncotic pressure in Bowman's space is considered negligible.\n    Mathematically, this assumption is stated as:\n    $$\\pi_{BS} \\approx 0 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$$\n\n2.  **Unit Reflection Coefficient for Proteins**: The reflection coefficient, $\\sigma$, quantifies the effectiveness of the membrane in preventing solute passage. For a membrane that is completely impermeable to a solute, $\\sigma = 1$. For a freely permeable membrane, $\\sigma = 0$. Given the near-total impermeability of the healthy glomerular barrier to plasma proteins, the reflection coefficient for these proteins is assumed to be unity.\n    Mathematically, this assumption is stated as:\n    $$\\sigma \\approx 1$$\n\nApplying these two simplifying assumptions to the general $GFR$ equation:\n$$GFR = K_f [ (P_{GC} - P_{BS}) - (1) (\\pi_{GC} - 0) ]$$\nThis simplifies to the standard expression for $GFR$ under normal physiological conditions:\n$$GFR = K_f ( P_{GC} - P_{BS} - \\pi_{GC} )$$\n\n### Step 3: Numerical Evaluation of GFR\n\nWe can now compute the whole-kidney $GFR$ using the provided numerical values and the simplified equation.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Whole-kidney filtration coefficient: $K_{f} = 12.5 \\ \\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}^{-1}$\n- Glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure: $P_{GC} = 50 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- Bowman's space hydrostatic pressure: $P_{BS} = 15 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- Mean glomerular capillary plasma oncotic pressure: $\\pi_{GC} = 25 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the Net Filtration Pressure ($P_{UF}$):\n$$P_{UF} = P_{GC} - P_{BS} - \\pi_{GC}$$\n$$P_{UF} = 50 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg} - 15 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg} - 25 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$$\n$$P_{UF} = 35 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg} - 25 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$$\n$$P_{UF} = 10 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$$\n\nThe Net Filtration Pressure is $10 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$. This positive pressure drives fluid out of the glomerular capillaries and into Bowman's space.\n\nNext, we calculate the $GFR$ by multiplying the Net Filtration Pressure by the filtration coefficient $K_f$:\n$$GFR = K_f \\times P_{UF}$$\n$$GFR = (12.5 \\ \\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}^{-1}) \\times (10 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg})$$\n$$GFR = 125 \\ \\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the numerical answer to four significant figures.\n$$GFR = 125.0 \\ \\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$$\nThis value is a typical whole-kidney $GFR$ for a healthy adult.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{125.0}\n$$", "id": "4978781"}, {"introduction": "While understanding the forces behind filtration is crucial, measuring kidney function in a living person requires a different toolkit.

It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective problem in renal physiology. It provides a complete and consistent set of data and definitions required for a unique solution. The values are within plausible physiological ranges. The problem asks for a series of calculations based on the fundamental principles of renal clearance and mass balance, culminating in the fractional excretion of sodium.\n\nWe begin by applying the principle of mass conservation, which underlies the concept of renal clearance. For any substance $x$ at a physiological steady state, the rate at which it is excreted in the urine must equal the rate at which it is cleared from the plasma by the kidneys. The excretion rate is the product of the urine concentration of the substance, $U_x$, and the urine flow rate, $V$. The rate of clearance is the product of the plasma concentration, $P_x$, and the clearance, $C_x$. Thus, $U_x V = P_x C_x$, which gives the general formula for clearance:\n$$C_x = \\frac{U_x V}{P_x}$$\n\n1.  **Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)**\n    The GFR is the volume of fluid filtered from the glomerular capillaries into Bowman's capsule per unit time. Inulin is the reference substance for measuring GFR because it is freely filtered and is neither reabsorbed nor secreted by the renal tubules. Therefore, the clearance of inulin is equal to the GFR.\n    $$GFR = C_{\\text{inulin}} = \\frac{U_{\\text{inulin}} V}{P_{\\text{inulin}}}$$\n    We are given the following values:\n    $V = 1.20\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$\n    $U_{\\text{inulin}} = 110\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$\n    $P_{\\text{inulin}} = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$\n    The units for the urine and plasma concentrations are identical ($\\mathrm{mg/dL}$), so their ratio is dimensionless, and the GFR will have the units of $V$.\n    $$GFR = \\frac{110\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}}{1.00\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}} \\times 1.20\\,\\mathrm{mL/min} = 110 \\times 1.20\\,\\mathrm{mL/min} = 132\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$$\n\n2.  **Renal Plasma Flow (RPF)**\n    Para-aminohippurate (PAH) is used to measure RPF. It is both filtered and efficiently secreted, such that most of the PAH entering the kidney is excreted in a single pass. The clearance of PAH, $C_{\\text{PAH}}$, represents the volume of plasma cleared of PAH per unit time, termed the effective renal plasma flow (eRPF).\n    $$eRPF = C_{\\text{PAH}} = \\frac{U_{\\text{PAH}} V}{P_{\\text{PAH}}}$$\n    Given:\n    $U_{\\text{PAH}} = 80.0\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$\n    $P_{\\text{PAH}} = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$\n    $$eRPF = \\frac{80.0\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}}{0.20\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}} \\times 1.20\\,\\mathrm{mL/min} = 400 \\times 1.20\\,\\mathrm{mL/min} = 480\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$$\n    The true renal plasma flow (RPF) is higher than the eRPF because the extraction of PAH is not $100\\%$. The given extraction ratio, $E_{\\text{PAH}} = 0.90$, relates eRPF and RPF by $eRPF = RPF \\times E_{\\text{PAH}}$. Thus, the true RPF is:\n    $$RPF = \\frac{eRPF}{E_{\\text{PAH}}} = \\frac{480\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}}{0.90} \\approx 533.33\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$$\n\n3.  **Filtration Fraction (FF)**\n    The filtration fraction is the fraction of renal plasma flow that is filtered at the glomerulus.\n    $$FF = \\frac{GFR}{RPF} = \\frac{132\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}}{533.33...\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}} = \\frac{132}{480/0.90} = 0.2475$$\n\n4.  **Renal Blood Flow (RBF)**\n    Renal blood flow is related to RPF via the hematocrit (Hct), which is the volume fraction of red blood cells in whole blood. The plasma constitutes the remaining fraction, $1 - Hct$.\n    $$RBF = \\frac{RPF}{1 - Hct} = \\frac{533.33...\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}}{1 - 0.45} = \\frac{533.33...\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}}{0.55} \\approx 969.7\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$$\n\n5.  **Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)**\n    The final quantity to be computed is the fractional excretion of sodium, defined as the fraction of the filtered sodium load that is excreted in the urine.\n    $$FE_{\\text{Na}} = \\frac{\\text{Rate of sodium excretion}}{\\text{Rate of sodium filtration}}$$\n    The rate of sodium excretion is given by the product of the urine sodium concentration and the urine flow rate: $U_{\\text{Na}} V$.\n    The rate of sodium filtration (the filtered load of sodium) is given by the product of the plasma sodium concentration and the glomerular filtration rate: $P_{\\text{Na}} GFR$.\n    Therefore, the formula for $FE_{\\text{Na}}$ is:\n    $$FE_{\\text{Na}} = \\frac{U_{\\text{Na}} V}{P_{\\text{Na}} GFR}$$\n    We are given the following values:\n    $U_{\\text{Na}} = 60.0\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$\n    $P_{\\text{Na}} = 140\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$\n    $V = 1.20\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$\n    And we have calculated:\n    $GFR = 132\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$\n    The units for $U_{\\text{Na}}$ and $P_{\\text{Na}}$ ($\\mathrm{mmol/L}$) are consistent with each other, and the units for $V$ and $GFR$ ($\\mathrm{mL/min}$) are also consistent. Therefore, their respective ratios are dimensionless, and the final result for $FE_{\\text{Na}}$ will be a unitless fraction.\n    $$FE_{\\text{Na}} = \\frac{(60.0\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}) \\times (1.20\\,\\mathrm{mL/min})}{(140\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}) \\times (132\\,\\mathrm{mL/min})}$$\n    $$FE_{\\text{Na}} = \\frac{60.0 \\times 1.20}{140 \\times 132} = \\frac{72.0}{18480}$$\n    $$FE_{\\text{Na}} \\approx 0.003896103896...$$\n    The problem requires the final answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n    $$FE_{\\text{Na}} \\approx 0.003896$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.003896}$$", "id": "4978767"}, {"introduction": "Beyond filtration, the kidneys' most vital role is to finely regulate the body's internal environment, especially its water content and overall osmolality.

The provided numerical values are physiologically realistic for a healthy adult under antidiuresis (water restriction leading to high ADH levels): plasma osmolality ($288$ mOsm/L) is in the normal range (approx. $285-295$ mOsm/L), while urine osmolality ($960$ mOsm/L) and urine flow rate ($0.60$ mL/min) are characteristic of a state of water conservation.

The problem is self-contained, consistent, and free of any scientific or logical flaws.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of Osmolar Clearance ($C_{osm}$)\nThe principle of renal clearance is based on the conservation of mass. The rate at which a substance is removed from the plasma must equal the rate at which it is excreted in the urine. For any substance $s$, this is expressed as:\n$$C_s \\times P_s = U_s \\times V$$\nwhere $C_s$ is the clearance of substance $s$, $P_s$ is its plasma concentration, $U_s$ is its urine concentration, and $V$ is the urine flow rate.\n\nTo find the osmolar clearance, $C_{osm}$, we apply this principle to the total solute content, or \"osmoles.\" The concentration of osmoles is the osmolality. Thus, we replace $s$ with $osm$, $P_s$ with plasma osmolality ($P_{osm}$), and $U_s$ with urine osmolality ($U_{osm}$). The equation becomes:\n$$C_{osm} \\times P_{osm} = U_{osm} \\times V$$\nSolving for $C_{osm}$, we obtain the expression for osmolar clearance:\n$$C_{osm} = \\frac{U_{osm} \\times V}{P_{osm}}$$\nThis represents the volume of plasma that is completely cleared of solutes per unit time.\n\n### Derivation of Free Water Clearance ($\\tilde{C}_{H_2O}$)\nThe total urine flow rate, $V$, can be conceptually divided into two components:\n$1$. The volume of plasma water required to excrete the urinary solutes in a solution that is isotonic (iso-osmotic) to plasma. This volume is, by definition, the osmolar clearance, $C_{osm}$.\n$2$. The volume of pure, solute-free water that is either added to or removed from this iso-osmotic fluid to produce the final urine. This volume is the free water clearance, $\\tilde{C}_{H_2O}$.\n\nThe relationship is expressed as a simple sum:\n$$V = C_{osm} + \\tilde{C}_{H_2O}$$\nTo derive the expression for free water clearance, we rearrange this equation:\n$$\\tilde{C}_{H_2O} = V - C_{osm}$$\nSubstituting the previously derived expression for $C_{osm}$:\n$$\\tilde{C}_{H_2O} = V - \\left(\\frac{U_{osm} \\times V}{P_{osm}}\\right)$$\nFactoring out the urine flow rate $V$, we arrive at the final expression for free water clearance:\n$$\\tilde{C}_{H_2O} = V \\left(1 - \\frac{U_{osm}}{P_{osm}}\\right)$$\n\n### Numerical Calculation and Interpretation\nWe are given the following values:\n- $V = 0.60 \\text{ mL/min}$\n- $U_{osm} = 960 \\text{ mOsm/L}$\n- $P_{osm} = 288 \\text{ mOsm/L}$\n\nThe units for $U_{osm}$ and $P_{osm}$ (mOsm/L) cancel in the ratio, leaving $\\tilde{C}_{H_2O}$ with the same units as $V$ (mL/min), as required.\n\nSubstituting the numerical values into the derived formula:\n$$\\tilde{C}_{H_2O} = (0.60 \\text{ mL/min}) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{960}{288}\\right)$$\nThe ratio $\\frac{960}{288}$ simplifies:\n$$\\frac{960}{288} = \\frac{10 \\times 96}{3 \\times 96} = \\frac{10}{3}$$\nNow, we compute the value of $\\tilde{C}_{H_2O}$:\n$$\\tilde{C}_{H_2O} = 0.60 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{10}{3}\\right) = 0.60 \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{3} - \\frac{10}{3}\\right) = 0.60 \\times \\left(-\\frac{7}{3}\\right)$$\n$$\\tilde{C}_{H_2O} = -0.20 \\times 7 = -1.4 \\text{ mL/min}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, the value is $-1.40 \\text{ mL/min}$.\n\nThe sign of $\\tilde{C}_{H_2O}$ indicates the net handling of solute-free water by the kidneys.\n- If $\\tilde{C}_{H_2O} > 0$, solute-free water is being excreted. The urine is dilute relative to plasma ($U_{osm} < P_{osm}$). This is called diuresis.\n- If $\\tilde{C}_{H_2O} < 0$, solute-free water is being reabsorbed from the filtrate back into the blood. The urine is concentrated relative to plasma ($U_{osm} > P_{osm}$). This is called antidiuresis.\n- If $\\tilde{C}_{H_2O} = 0$, the urine is iso-osmotic with plasma ($U_{osm} = P_{osm}$).\n\nIn this case, $\\tilde{C}_{H_2O} = -1.40 \\text{ mL/min}$. The negative sign indicates that the kidney is reabsorbing $1.40$ mL of solute-free water every minute. This process concentrates the solutes remaining in the tubular fluid, resulting in the excretion of urine that is hyperosmotic to plasma.
