In the Hodgkin-Huxley model, this conductance is not constant but depends on the state of the voltage-gated sodium channels. Specifically, the conductance is given by $g_{\\text{Na}} = \\bar{g}_{\\text{Na}} m^3 h$, where $\\bar{g}_{\\text{Na}}$ is the maximum possible conductance, $m$ is the activation gate variable, and $h$ is the inactivation gate variable. The variable $m$ represents the probability that the activation gates of a channel are open, while $h$ represents the probability that the inactivation gate is open (i.e., the channel is not inactivated). For a channel to conduct sodium ions, both its activation and inactivation gates must be open.\n\nAn action potential is initiated by a large, rapid influx of $\\text{Na}^+$ ions, which requires a substantial sodium conductance $g_{\\text{Na}}$. This occurs when a depolarizing stimulus raises the membrane potential $V$ to threshold, causing a rapid increase in the activation variable $m$ (gates opening).\n\nThe absolute refractory period is the interval immediately following an action potential spike. During the spike's peak and subsequent repolarization phase, the sustained depolarization causes the inactivation gates to close, meaning the variable $h$ approaches $0$. Immediately after the spike, at $t=0$, we have $h(0) \\approx 0$. Consequently, the sodium conductance $g_{\\text{Na}} = \\bar{g}_{\\text{Na}} m^3 h$ is also approximately $0$, regardless of the state of the activation gates ($m$).\n\nIf a second, even very strong, depolarizing stimulus is applied during this period, it may be sufficient to open the activation gates (i.e., drive $m$ towards $1$). However, because the inactivation gates are closed ($h \\approx 0$), the product $m^3 h$ remains near zero. The total sodium conductance $g_{\\text{Na}}$ is therefore negligible, and the required inward sodium current cannot be generated. Without this influx of positive charge, the membrane potential cannot be driven to the threshold for another action potential. The recovery of the inactivation gates from their closed state (the increase of $h$ back towards $1$) is a time-dependent process that requires the membrane to repolarize and remain at a negative potential for a certain duration. This time-dependent recovery, which is not instantly responsive to a new stimulus, is the fundamental reason for the existence of the absolute refractory period.\n\n**Part B: Derivation and Calculation**\n\nWe model the inactivation gate using a two-state kinetic scheme:\n$$\nI \\underset{k_{AI}(V)}{\\stackrel{k_{IA}(V)}{\\rightleftharpoons}} A\n$$\nwhere $A$ represents the \"available\" (non-inactivated) state and $I$ represents the \"inactivated\" state. The variable $h(t)$ is the fraction of gates in state $A$. The fraction of gates in state $I$ is therefore $(1 - h(t))$.\n\nThe rate of change of the fraction of available gates, $\\frac{dh}{dt}$, is the rate of gates transitioning from $I$ to $A$ minus the rate of gates transitioning from $A$ to $I$.\nThe flux from $I$ to $A$ is the rate constant $k_{IA}(V)$ multiplied by the fraction of gates in state $I$, which is $k_{IA}(V)(1-h)$.\nThe flux from $A$ to $I$ is the rate constant $k_{AI}(V)$ multiplied by the fraction of gates in state $A$, which is $k_{AI}(V)h$.\n\nCombining these gives the ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $h(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dh}{dt} = k_{IA}(V)(1-h) - k_{AI}(V)h\n$$\nTo identify the steady state $h_{\\infty}(V)$ and time constant $\\tau_h(V)$, we rearrange the ODE into a standard form.\n$$\n\\frac{dh}{dt} = k_{IA}(V) - k_{IA}(V)h - k_{AI}(V)h\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dh}{dt} = k_{IA}(V) - (k_{IA}(V) + k_{AI}(V))h\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ODE.
