A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem asks for the net change in bone volume, which is the accumulation of volume changes over time. The rate of change of a quantity $V$ with respect to time $t$ is given by its derivative, $\\frac{dV}{dt}$. The total change in volume, $\\Delta V$, over a time interval from $t_0$ to $t_f$ is the integral of the rate of change:\n$$\n\\Delta V = \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\frac{dV}{dt} dt\n$$\nIn this problem, all rates are assumed to be constant. If $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ is a constant value, the integral simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Delta V = \\frac{dV}{dt} \\times (t_f - t_0) = \\frac{dV}{dt} \\times \\Delta t\n$$\n\nFirst, let's determine the net rate of volume change for a single Basic Multicellular Unit (BMU). According to the specified sign convention, formation is positive and resorption is negative.\nLet $\\frac{dV_{\\text{BMU}}}{dt}$ be the net rate of volume change for one BMU. It is the sum of the formation rate and the resorption rate.\nThe formation rate is given as $R_{\\text{form}} = 0.018\\ \\mathrm{mm}^{3}/\\text{day}$. With the sign convention, this contribution is +$R_{\\text{form}}$.\nThe resorption rate is given as $R_{\\text{res}} = 0.02\\ \\mathrm{mm}^{3}/\\text{day}$. With the sign convention, this contribution is -$R_{\\text{res}}$.\n\nTherefore, the net rate for one BMU is:\n$$\n\\frac{dV_{\\text{BMU}}}{dt} = R_{\\text{form}} - R_{\\text{res}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\frac{dV_{\\text{BMU}}}{dt} = 0.018\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mm}^{3}}{\\text{day}} - 0.02\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mm}^{3}}{\\text{day}} = -0.002\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mm}^{3}}{\\text{day}}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates a net loss of bone volume within a single active BMU.\n\nNext, we calculate the total rate of volume change for the entire region, which contains $N=100$ active BMUs. The problem states that the net volume change is the linear superposition of the contributions from each BMU. This means the total rate is the rate per BMU multiplied by the number of BMUs.\nLet $\\frac{dV_{\\text{total}}}{dt}$ be the total net rate of volume change for the region.\n$$\n\\frac{dV_{\\text{total}}}{dt} = N \\times \\frac{dV_{\\text{BMU}}}{dt}\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\n\\frac{dV_{\\text{total}}}{dt} = 100 \\times \\left(-0.002\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mm}^{3}}{\\text{day}}\\right) = -0.2\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mm}^{3}}{\\text{day}}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the total net volume change, $\\Delta V_{\\text{total}}$, over the specified time period of $\\Delta t = 30\\ \\text{days}$. Since the total rate is constant, we can use the simplified formula $\\Delta V = \\text{rate} \\times \\Delta t$.\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{dV_{\\text{total}}}{dt} \\times \\Delta t\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated total rate and the given time period:\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\text{total}} = \\left(-0.2\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mm}^{3}}{\\text{day}}\\right) \\times (30\\ \\text{days})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\text{total}} = -6\\ \\mathrm{mm}^{3}\n$$\nThe net change in bone volume over $30$ days is a loss of $6\\ \\mathrm{mm}^{3}$. The final answer must be expressed as a signed value, which is $-6$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-6}\n$$", "id": "4948375"}, {"introduction": "The force that a muscle can exert on the skeleton is determined not only by its physiological cross-sectional area but also by its internal architecture. Many muscles feature a pennate design, where fibers attach to the tendon at an angle, a configuration that allows for greater fiber packing but introduces a biomechanical trade-off. This practice delves into the relationship between muscle fiber force and the force transmitted to the tendon, demonstrating how changes in pennation angle during contraction directly impact the torque generated at a joint.

The givens are scientifically consistent and sufficient for a unique solution. The scenario represents a standard, albeit simplified, model in muscle biomechanics used to understand the effect of muscle architecture on force and torque production. The potential ambiguity between an \"isometric contraction\" and a \"shortening\" muscle is resolved by interpreting the problem as a comparison between two distinct static states characterized by different muscle lengths and their corresponding pennation angles, a common approach in introductory problems of this nature. The problem is well-posed and objective.\n\nThe solution proceeds by deriving the required relationships from first principles.\n\nFirst, we derive the relationship between the tendon force, $F_{t}$, and the fiber-aligned force, $F_{f}$. A unipennate muscle consists of fibers aligned at a pennation angle, $\\theta$, relative to the muscle's line of action defined by its tendon. The total force produced by the muscle fibers, $F_{f}$, is directed along the fibers. The force transmitted to the skeleton via the tendon, $F_{t}$, is the component of the fiber force projected onto the tendon's axis. Based on the principles of vector decomposition, this relationship is given by:\n$$F_{t}(\\theta) = F_{f} \\cos(\\theta)$$\nThis derivation establishes the force transmitted along the tendon as a function of the pennation angle.\n\nSecond, we derive the expression for the joint torque, $\\tau$. Joint torque is the rotational effect of a force about an axis of rotation. From first principles, its magnitude is defined as the product of the force's magnitude and its moment arm, provided the force is applied perpendicularly to the moment arm ($\\tau = rF\\sin\\phi$, where $\\phi$ is the angle between the force vector and the moment arm vector). The problem states that the moment arm, $r$, is fixed and the line of action of the tendon force, $F_{t}$, is perpendicular to it throughout the motion. This implies that the angle $\\phi$ is constant at $90^{\\circ}$, and since $\\sin(90^{\\circ}) = 1$, the expression for joint torque simplifies to:\n$$\\tau = r F_{t}$$\n\nBy substituting the expression for $F_{t}$ into the expression for $\\tau$, we obtain the joint torque as a function of the pennation angle:\n$$\\tau(\\theta) = r (F_{f} \\cos(\\theta)) = r F_{f} \\cos(\\theta)$$\nThe problem specifies a constant fiber force $F_{f} = 1500\\ \\mathrm{N}$ and a constant moment arm $r = 0.045\\ \\mathrm{m}$. As part of the reasoning, we determine the initial and final tendon forces.\n\nThe initial state is characterized by $\\theta_{i} = 15^{\\circ}$. The initial tendon force is:\n$$F_{t,i} = F_{f} \\cos(\\theta_{i}) = 1500 \\cos(15^{\\circ}) \\approx 1448.89\\ \\mathrm{N}$$\nThe final state is characterized by $\\theta_{f} = 25^{\\circ}$. The final tendon force is:\n$$F_{t,f} = F_{f} \\cos(\\theta_{f}) = 1500 \\cos(25^{\\circ}) \\approx 1359.46\\ \\mathrm{N}$$\n\nThe ratio of final to initial joint torque, $R$, is defined as $R = \\tau_{f} / \\tau_{i}$. We can express the initial torque, $\\tau_{i}$, and final torque, $\\tau_{f}$, using the derived relationship:\n$$\\tau_{i} = r F_{f} \\cos(\\theta_{i})$$\n$$\\tau_{f} = r F_{f} \\cos(\\theta_{f})$$\n\nNow, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{\\tau_{f}}{\\tau_{i}} = \\frac{r F_{f} \\cos(\\theta_{f})}{r F_{f} \\cos(\\theta_{i})}$$\nSince $r$ and $F_{f}$ are constants, they cancel from the numerator and denominator, yielding a simplified expression for the ratio that depends only on the pennation angles:\n$$R = \\frac{\\cos(\\theta_{f})}{\\cos(\\theta_{i})}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values $\\theta_{i} = 15^{\\circ}$ and $\\theta_{f} = 25^{\\circ}$:\n$$R = \\frac{\\cos(25^{\\circ})}{\\cos(15^{\\circ})}$$\n\nPerforming the calculation using the values for cosine:\n$$R \\approx \\frac{0.906307787}{0.965925826} \\approx 0.938278$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$R \\approx 0.9383$$\nThis result indicates that as the muscle shortens and the pennation angle increases from $15^{\\circ}$ to $25^{\\circ}$, the torque-generating capacity at the joint decreases to approximately $93.83\\%$ of its initial value, assuming constant fiber force.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9383}$$", "id": "4948368"}, {"introduction": "Tendons are the critical link that transmits muscle-generated forces to the skeleton, enabling movement.
