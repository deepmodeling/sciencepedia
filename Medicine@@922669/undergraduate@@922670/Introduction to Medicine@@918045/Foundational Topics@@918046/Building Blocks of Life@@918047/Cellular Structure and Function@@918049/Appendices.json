Assume the membrane is highly permeable to water but, on the acute timescale of seconds, effectively impermeable to solutes. Consider ideal dilute-solution behavior and take the reflection coefficient for the main solutes to be unity. The cell’s baseline effective intracellular osmolarity is $C_{i0} = 300$ mOsm/L, and its initial volume is $V_0 = 1.2$ picoliters. The external bath is suddenly changed to a hypertonic solution with effective osmolarity $C_{o} = 420$ mOsm/L at constant temperature.\n\nUsing the principles that osmotic pressure in dilute solutions is proportional to solute concentration and that water moves rapidly to equalize the osmotic pressure across a semipermeable membrane, derive from first principles the acute post-shock cell volume $V_1$ under these assumptions.\n\nNext, suppose the cell upregulates the sodium–potassium–chloride cotransporter (NKCC) and sodium channels to accumulate sodium chloride as the dominant permeant osmolyte to recover volume.

This is a classic biophysics problem governed by the principles of osmosis and mass conservation. The solution is developed in two sequential parts.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the acute cell shrinkage.\nThe initial state of the cell is at osmotic equilibrium in an isotonic medium. The initial intracellular osmolarity is given as $C_{i0} = 300$ mOsm/L, and the initial volume is $V_0 = 1.2$ pL. Since the medium is isotonic, the initial external osmolarity must be equal to the internal one, $C_{o0} = C_{i0} = 300$ mOsm/L.\n\nThe total number of osmoles of impermeant solutes inside the cell, $N_i$, is constant during the initial rapid volume change. This number is given by the product of the initial concentration and volume:\n$$N_i = C_{i0} V_0$$\nThe external medium is abruptly changed to a hypertonic solution with an effective osmolarity of $C_{o} = 420$ mOsm/L. In response, water flows out of the cell, causing it to shrink to a new, smaller volume, $V_1$. This process stops when a new osmotic equilibrium is reached, at which point the new intracellular osmolarity, $C_{i1}$, equals the external osmolarity, $C_{o}$.\n$$C_{i1} = C_{o}$$\nDuring this process, the number of intracellular impermeant solutes, $N_i$, remains constant. The new osmolarity and volume are related by:\n$$N_i = C_{i1} V_1$$\nBy the principle of conservation of these solutes, we can equate the initial and final expressions for $N_i$:\n$$C_{i0} V_0 = C_{i1} V_1$$\nSubstituting $C_{i1} = C_{o}$, we obtain the Boyle-van't Hoff relation for an ideal osmometer:\n$$C_{i0} V_0 = C_{o} V_1$$\nThis equation describes the acute shrinkage of the cell. Although not directly requested in the final answer, it forms the basis for the subsequent analysis.\n\nNext, we analyze the regulatory volume increase (RVI).\nFollowing the acute shrinkage, the cell actively accumulates sodium chloride (NaCl) to restore its volume to the original value, $V_0$. The external osmolarity remains constant at $C_{o} = 420$ mOsm/L.\nFor the cell to be at equilibrium with the external medium at its restored volume $V_0$, its final intracellular osmolarity, $C_{i, \\text{final}}$, must be equal to the external osmolarity, $C_{o}$.\n$$C_{i, \\text{final}} = C_{o} = 420 \\text{ mOsm/L}$$\nThe total number of osmoles inside the cell in this final state, $N_{i, \\text{final}}$, is given by:\n$$N_{i, \\text{final}} = C_{i, \\text{final}} V_0 = C_{o} V_0$$\nThis final quantity of osmoles is composed of two parts: the original impermeant osmoles, $N_i$, and the newly accumulated osmoles from NaCl, which we denote as $\\Delta N_{\\text{osm}}$.\n$$N_{i, \\text{final}} = N_i + \\Delta N_{\\text{osm}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $N_{i, \\text{final}}$ and $N_i = C_{i0} V_0$:\n$$C_{o} V_0 = C_{i0} V_0 + \\Delta N_{\\text{osm}}$$\nThe problem asks for the additional intracellular concentration of NaCl, $\\Delta C_{\\mathrm{NaCl}}$. This is the number of moles of added NaCl, $\\Delta M_{\\mathrm{NaCl}}$, divided by the final volume, $V_0$.\n$$\\Delta C_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} = \\frac{\\Delta M_{\\mathrm{NaCl}}}{V_0}$$\nNaCl dissociates fully with a van't Hoff factor of $i=2$. Therefore, the number of osmoles added, $\\Delta N_{\\text{osm}}$, is twice the number of moles of NaCl added.\n$$\\Delta N_{\\text{osm}} = i \\cdot \\Delta M_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} = 2 \\cdot (\\Delta C_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} V_0)$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\Delta N_{\\text{osm}}$ into the osmolar balance equation:\n$$C_{o} V_0 = C_{i0} V_0 + 2 \\cdot \\Delta C_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} \\cdot V_0$$\nSince the volume $V_0$ is a common factor in all terms and is non-zero, it can be cancelled from the equation. This demonstrates that the required concentration change is independent of the cell's absolute volume.\n$$C_{o} = C_{i0} + 2 \\Delta C_{\\mathrm{NaCl}}$$\nThis equation states that the final internal osmolarity is the sum of the initial osmolarity and the osmolarity added by NaCl. We can now solve for $\\Delta C_{\\mathrm{NaCl}}$:\n$$2 \\Delta C_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} = C_{o} - C_{i0}$$\nSubstituting the given values, $C_{o} = 420$ mOsm/L and $C_{i0} = 300$ mOsm/L:\n$$2 \\Delta C_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} = 420 \\text{ mOsm/L} - 300 \\text{ mOsm/L} = 120 \\text{ mOsm/L}$$\nThe total increase in osmolarity required is $120$ mOsm/L.

Peroxisomal matrix protein recognized by Peroxisomal Targeting Signal $1$ (PTS$1$) and delivered by Peroxin $5$ (Pex$5$).", "solution": "Begin from the Central Dogma and core definitions of eukaryotic protein targeting. In eukaryotic cells, most proteins initiate translation on cytosolic ribosomes. Targeting to specific organelles is mediated by topogenic signals that are recognized by cognate receptors. For proteins entering the secretory pathway, an N-terminal ER signal sequence is recognized co-translationally by Signal Recognition Particle (SRP), which pauses translation and targets the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the SRP receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The ribosome then engages the Sec$61$ translocon for translocation into or across the ER membrane. After entry, signal peptidase can cleave signal sequences at consensus small-residue motifs, yielding soluble lumenal proteins if no additional membrane-anchoring sequences are present. Proteins with a C-terminal Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) motif are retrieved from the Golgi apparatus back to the ER by the KDEL receptor, establishing ER lumen residency at steady state. In contrast, nuclear import relies on exposure of a Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) to the cytosol for recognition by importin $\\alpha/\\beta$, and mitochondrial import typically depends on an N-terminal basic amphipathic helix recognized by Translocase of the Outer Membrane (TOM) and threaded by Translocase of the Inner Membrane (TIM). Peroxisomal matrix import often uses Peroxisomal Targeting Signal $1$ (PTS$1$), the Ser-Lys-Leu ($SKL$) tripeptide at the extreme C-terminus, recognized by Peroxin $5$ (Pex$5$).\n\nApply these principles to Protein X:\n\n- The N-terminal region ($1$ to $25$) possesses the hallmarks of an ER signal sequence: a positively charged N-region, a hydrophobic core of approximately $12$ contiguous aliphatic residues, and a canonical small-residue motif at the predicted signal peptidase cleavage between residues $25$ and $26$. This will be recognized co-translationally by SRP, targeting the nascent chain to the ER via the SRP receptor, engaging Sec$61$, and allowing translocation into the ER. The presence of a cleavable signal peptidase motif indicates the signal sequence will be removed, producing a mature polypeptide beginning just after residue $25$.\n- After signal cleavage, whether Protein X remains soluble in the ER lumen or becomes a membrane protein depends on the presence and nature of additional hydrophobic segments, such as a sufficiently long hydrophobic stop-transfer or signal anchor (often $> 18$ contiguous hydrophobic residues) to span the membrane as an $\\alpha$-helix. The data explicitly state there is no hydrophobic segment longer than $18$ residues after residue $25$, and the longest patch is approximately $10$ residues flanked by polar residues. Such a short, interrupted hydrophobic segment is unlikely to serve as a transmembrane helix. Therefore, Protein X will remain soluble within the ER lumen after translocation.\n- The C-terminal KDEL motif is a well-established ER retrieval signal. Proteins bearing KDEL that escape to the Golgi are captured by KDEL receptors and returned to the ER. Thus, at steady state, a soluble KDEL-bearing protein is retained in the ER lumen.\n- The central basic cluster resembling an NLS cannot override ER entry because nuclear import requires the NLS to be accessible in the cytosol to recruit importin $\\alpha/\\beta$. Co-translational engagement of the secretory pathway by SRP ensures that Protein X is threaded into the ER lumen; any NLS within the lumen is not accessible to cytosolic import receptors. Furthermore, the presence of KDEL confers ER retention even if any fraction were to traffic forward.\n- Mitochondrial targeting is inconsistent with the observed N-terminus; the sequence exhibits a hydrophobic signal peptide signature rather than a basic amphipathic helix that alternates polar and hydrophobic residues, and the co-translational ER targeting would kinetically and topologically preclude TOM/TIM engagement.\n- Peroxisomal targeting is unlikely because Protein X lacks the canonical PTS$1$ ($SKL$) at the extreme C-terminus; additionally, co-translational ER entry would sequester the polypeptide in the lumen and away from cytosolic Pex$5$ recognition.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Soluble resident of the ER lumen retained by KDEL after SRP-mediated co-translational translocation. This fits the N-terminal ER signal sequence with signal peptidase cleavage, the absence of long hydrophobic segments after cleavage (predicting a soluble lumenal protein), and the presence of the KDEL retrieval motif ensuring ER residence. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. Nuclear protein via importin $\\alpha/\\beta$ recognition of the NLS. Although a central basic cluster resembles an NLS, nuclear import requires cytosolic exposure of the NLS for importin binding. Co-translational SRP targeting will thread Protein X into the ER lumen, rendering the NLS lumenal and inaccessible to cytosolic import machinery. Additionally, KDEL actively retains the protein in the ER. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. Mitochondrial matrix protein via TOM/TIM. The N-terminus lacks the amphipathic helix characteristic of a mitochondrial targeting sequence and instead matches an ER signal peptide. Co-translational ER targeting competitively precludes mitochondrial import. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. Type I single-pass plasma membrane protein due to a stop-transfer sequence. Post-signal-peptide integration requires a sufficiently long hydrophobic segment (typically $> 18$ residues) to form a transmembrane helix acting as a stop-transfer or signal anchor. The sequence description states no such segment exists; the longest hydrophobic patch is approximately $10$ residues and is interrupted by polar residues, making stable membrane insertion unlikely. Furthermore, a C-terminal KDEL motif is incompatible with plasma membrane residency and instead mediates ER retrieval. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. Peroxisomal matrix protein recognized by PTS$1$ ($SKL$) via Pex$5$. Protein X lacks an $SKL$ at the extreme C-terminus, and its co-translational ER entry sequesters it from cytosolic peroxin recognition. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most scientifically consistent prediction is that Protein X is a soluble ER lumenal resident retained by KDEL at steady state after SRP-dependent co-translational translocation and signal peptide cleavage.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4950897"}]}
