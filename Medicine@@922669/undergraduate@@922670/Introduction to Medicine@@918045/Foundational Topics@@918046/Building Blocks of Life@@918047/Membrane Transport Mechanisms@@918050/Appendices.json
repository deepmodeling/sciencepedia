This process is governed by Fick's first law of diffusion.\n\nThe fundamental principle is that the flux density, $J$, which is the amount of substance crossing a unit area per unit time, is proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient, $\\frac{dC}{dx}$. This is expressed as:\n$$J = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient of the substance within the membrane.\n\nFor a substance diffusing across a membrane of thickness $\\Delta x$, we must also consider the partitioning of the solute from the aqueous solution into the lipid membrane. This is described by the partition coefficient, $K$, defined as the ratio of the equilibrium concentration within the membrane to the concentration in the aqueous solution. The concentrations of the solute just inside the membrane at the outer and inner surfaces are $K C_o$ and $K C_i$, respectively, where $C_o$ is the extracellular concentration and $C_i$ is the intracellular concentration.\n\nAssuming a linear concentration gradient across the membrane, we can approximate the gradient as:\n$$\\frac{dC}{dx} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta C_{\\text{membrane}}}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{K C_i - K C_o}{\\Delta x}$$\nSubstituting this into Fick's first law gives the net flux density from outside to inside:\n$$J = -D \\left( \\frac{K C_i - K C_o}{\\Delta x} \\right) = \\frac{D K}{\\Delta x} (C_o - C_i)$$\nThe problem statement notes that the permeability coefficient, $P$, encapsulates the effects of membrane thickness, diffusion, and partitioning. The permeability coefficient is defined as:\n$$P = \\frac{D K}{\\Delta x}$$\nThus, the expression for the flux density simplifies to:\n$$J = P (C_o - C_i)$$\nThis equation defines the net flux of the solute per unit area per unit time. The sign convention is established such that if $C_o > C_i$, the flux $J$ is positive, corresponding to a net movement of the molecule from the extracellular compartment to the intracellular compartment.\n\nThe problem asks for the total net rate of diffusion across the entire membrane area, which we will denote as $\\Phi$. This is obtained by multiplying the flux density $J$ by the total membrane area $A$:\n$$\\Phi = J \\cdot A = P \\cdot A \\cdot (C_o - C_i)$$\n\nTo compute the numerical value of $\\Phi$, we must first ensure all given quantities are in a consistent set of units.

This requires a three-step process: first, calculating the equilibrium potential for potassium ($E_{\\mathrm{K}}$); second, determining the electrochemical driving force; and third, calculating the current ($I_{\\mathrm{K}}$) using the given conductance ($g_{\\mathrm{K}}$).\n\n**Step 1: Calculation of the Potassium Reversal Potential ($E_{\\mathrm{K}}$)**\n\nThe reversal potential (or equilibrium potential) for a specific ion is the membrane potential at which there is no net movement of that ion across the membrane. It is described by the Nernst equation, which is derived from the condition that the total electrochemical potential difference for the ion across the membrane is zero. The Nernst equation is:\n$$E_{\\text{ion}} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\text{ion}]_{\\text{out}}}{[\\text{ion}]_{\\text{in}}}\\right)$$\nwhere $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $z$ is the valence of the ion, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $[\\text{ion}]_{\\text{out}}$ and $[\\text{ion}]_{\\text{in}}$ are the extracellular and intracellular concentrations of the ion, respectively.\n\nFor potassium ($K^{+}$), we substitute the given values into this equation:\n- Gas constant, $R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n- Temperature, $T = 310\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- Valence of $K^{+}$, $z = +1$\n- Faraday constant, $F = 96485\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- Extracellular concentration, $[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{out}} = 4.0\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\n- Intracellular concentration, $[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{in}} = 140.0\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\n\nThe calculation for $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ is as follows:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{K}} = \\frac{(8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (310\\,\\mathrm{K})}{(+1) \\times (96485\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}})} \\ln\\left(\\frac{4.0\\,\\mathrm{mM}}{140.0\\,\\mathrm{mM}}\\right)$$\nThe concentration units ($\\mathrm{mM}$) cancel out. The term $\\frac{RT}{F}$ evaluates to:\n$$\\frac{RT}{F} = \\frac{(8.314)(310)}{96485} \\approx 0.02671\\,\\mathrm{V} = 26.71\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nThe concentration ratio is:\n$$\\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{out}}}{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\text{in}}} = \\frac{4.0}{140.0} = \\frac{1}{35}$$\nSubstituting these into the equation for $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{K}} \\approx (0.02671\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{35}\\right) = (0.02671\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\times (-\\ln(35))$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{K}} \\approx (0.02671\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\times (-3.5553) \\approx -0.09496\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nConverting volts to millivolts ($1\\,\\mathrm{V} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{mV}$):\n$$E_{\\mathrm{K}} \\approx -95.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nWe will retain higher precision for the next calculation: $E_{\\mathrm{K}} = -94.9605\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determination of Driving Force and Ion Flow Direction**\n\nThe net electrochemical driving force on an ion is the difference between the actual membrane potential ($V_{m}$) and the ion's equilibrium potential ($E_{\\text{ion}}$). For potassium, the driving force is $(V_{m} - E_{\\mathrm{K}})$.\nGiven $V_{m} = -50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{K}} \\approx -95.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\nSince $V_{m}  E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ (i.e., $-50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ is less negative, and therefore greater, than $-95.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$), the driving force is positive:\n$$\\text{Driving Force} = V_{m} - E_{\\mathrm{K}} = (-50\\,\\mathrm{mV}) - (-94.9605\\,\\mathrm{mV}) = +44.9605\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nA positive driving force on a positively charged ion like $K^{+}$ will push it out of the cell, from the region of higher potential (relative to the equilibrium) to the region of lower potential. Therefore, there is a net outward movement of $K^{+}$ ions (an efflux).\n\n**Step 3: Calculation of the Potassium Current ($I_{\\mathrm{K}}$)**\n\nThe problem states that the channel exhibits ohmic behavior, meaning the current is linearly proportional to the driving force. The relationship is given by an equation analogous to Ohm's law:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{K}} = g_{\\mathrm{K}}(V_{m} - E_{\\mathrm{K}})$$\nwhere $I_{\\mathrm{K}}$ is the potassium current and $g_{\\mathrm{K}}$ is the potassium conductance. The problem provides $g_{\\mathrm{K}} = 8.0\\,\\mathrm{nS}$.\n\nThe electrophysiological sign convention is that a net outward movement of positive charge constitutes a positive current. Our analysis in Step 2 indicated an outward movement of $K^{+}$, so we expect a positive current, which is consistent with the positive sign of the driving force.\n\nWe now substitute the values into the current equation. It is convenient to use conductance in nanosiemens ($\\mathrm{nS}$) and potential in millivolts ($\\mathrm{mV}$), as their product directly yields current in picoamperes ($\\mathrm{pA}$):\n$$(\\mathrm{nS}) \\times (\\mathrm{mV}) = (10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S}) \\times (10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A} = 1\\,\\mathrm{pA}$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{K}} = (8.0\\,\\mathrm{nS}) \\times (+44.9605\\,\\mathrm{mV})$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{K}} = 359.684\\,\\mathrm{pA}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\nThe value $359.684$ rounded to three significant figures is $360$.
