I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the initial velocity equation starting from the mass-action form of the given mechanism.\n\nThe enzymatic reaction is described by the scheme:\n$$ E + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_2}{\\rightarrow} E + P $$\nwhere $k_1$, $k_{-1}$, and $k_2$ are the rate constants for the respective reaction steps.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rate of change of the enzyme-substrate complex concentration, $[ES]$, is given by:\n$$ \\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_1 [E][S] - k_{-1}[ES] - k_2[ES] $$\nThe first term on the right-hand side represents the formation of the $ES$ complex from the free enzyme $E$ and substrate $S$. The second and third terms represent the breakdown of the $ES$ complex, either back to $E$ and $S$ or forward to $E$ and product $P$.\n\nThe problem states to use the Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA), which assumes that after a very brief initial transient period, the concentration of the intermediate complex $[ES]$ remains approximately constant. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\frac{d[ES]}{dt} \\approx 0 $$\nApplying this approximation to the rate equation for $[ES]$:\n$$ k_1 [E][S] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] = 0 $$\n$$ k_1 [E][S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\n\nThe total enzyme concentration, $[E]_{\\mathrm{T}}$, is constant and is the sum of the free enzyme concentration, $[E]$, and the concentration of enzyme bound in the complex, $[ES]$:\n$$ [E]_{\\mathrm{T}} = [E] + [ES] $$\nFrom this conservation equation, we can express the free enzyme concentration as:\n$$ [E] = [E]_{\\mathrm{T}} - [ES] $$\nSubstituting this expression for $[E]$ into the steady-state equation:\n$$ k_1 ([E]_{\\mathrm{T}} - [ES])[S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\nOur goal is to solve for $[ES]$ to then find the reaction velocity. We expand and rearrange the equation:\n$$ k_1 [E]_{\\mathrm{T}}[S] - k_1 [ES][S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\n$$ k_1 [E]_{\\mathrm{T}}[S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] + k_1 [ES][S] $$\n$$ k_1 [E]_{\\mathrm{T}}[S] = [ES] (k_{-1} + k_2 + k_1[S]) $$\nSolving for $[ES]$:\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{k_1 [E]_{\\mathrm{T}}[S]}{k_{-1} + k_2 + k_1[S]} $$\nTo simplify this expression, we divide the numerator and the denominator by $k_1$:\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{[E]_{\\mathrm{T}}[S]}{\\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1} + [S]} $$\nThe Michaelis constant, $K_m$, is defined as the collection of rate constants $\\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1}$.\n$$ K_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1} $$\nSubstituting $K_m$ into the expression for $[ES]$ gives:\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{[E]_{\\mathrm{T}}[S]}{K_m + [S]} $$\nThe initial reaction velocity, $v$, is defined as the rate of formation of the product, $P$. Under the specified initial rate conditions, the reverse reaction $E+P \\rightarrow ES$ is negligible.\n$$ v = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_2 [ES] $$\nSubstituting the steady-state expression for $[ES]$ into the velocity equation:\n$$ v = k_2 \\left( \\frac{[E]_{\\mathrm{T}}[S]}{K_m + [S]} \\right) = \\frac{k_2 [E]_{\\mathrm{T}}[S]}{K_m + [S]} $$\nThe maximal velocity, $V_{\\max}$, is achieved when the enzyme is fully saturated with the substrate, i.e., when $[ES] = [E]_{\\mathrm{T}}$. In this case, the velocity is $v = k_2 [E]_{\\mathrm{T}}$. We therefore define:\n$$ V_{\\max} = k_2 [E]_{\\mathrm{T}} $$\nSubstituting $V_{\\max}$ into the velocity equation yields the final analytical expression, known as the Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$ v = \\frac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_m + [S]} $$\nThis completes the derivation part of the problem.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nNext, we evaluate the initial velocity $v$ using the provided values. The problem specifies the initial substrate concentration $[S]_0$ as the value for $[S]$ in the velocity equation.\nGiven:\n-   $V_{\\max} = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/min}$\n-   $K_{m} = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n-   $[S] = [S]_0 = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$ v = \\frac{(100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/min})(2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})}{5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} + 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} $$\n$$ v = \\frac{200}{7}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/min} $$\n$$ v \\approx 28.571428... \\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/min} $$\nThe problem requires rounding the numerical velocity to four significant figures.\n$$ v \\approx 28.57\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/min} $$\n\n### Interpretation\n\nFinally, we must interpret whether the reaction is substrate-limited. This is determined by comparing the substrate concentration $[S]$ to the Michaelis constant $K_m$.\n-   $[S] = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n-   $K_{m} = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nWe observe that $[S]  K_m$. Specifically, $[S] = 0.4\\,K_m$.\n\nThe Michaelis constant $K_m$ represents the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity is half of its maximum ($v = V_{\\max}/2$ when $[S] = K_m$).\n\nThere are three kinetic regimes for this system:\n1.  When $[S] \\ll K_m$: The denominator $K_m + [S] \\approx K_m$, so $v \\approx \\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_m}[S]$. The velocity is approximately first-order with respect to $[S]$ and is highly sensitive to changes in substrate concentration. This is the **substrate-limited** regime.\n2.  When $[S] \\gg K_m$: The denominator $K_m + [S] \\approx [S]$, so $v \\approx \\frac{V_{\\max}[S]}{[S]} = V_{\\max}$. The velocity is approximately zero-order with respect to $[S]$ and is insensitive to changes in substrate concentration. The reaction is limited by the enzyme's catalytic turnover rate, not substrate availability. This is the **enzyme-limited** or **saturation** regime.\n3.  When $[S] \\approx K_m$: The reaction exhibits mixed-order kinetics.\n\nIn the present case, since $[S] = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ is less than $K_m = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, the reaction is operating in a regime where the velocity is strongly dependent on the substrate concentration. Our calculated velocity $v \\approx 28.57\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/min}$ is only $28.57\\%$ of the maximal velocity $V_{\\max} = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/min}$, which is significantly below the half-maximal velocity of $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/min}$. This confirms that the enzyme population is far from saturated.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to determine the blood $\\mathrm{pH}$ from the given physiological parameters. This requires deriving the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation as it applies to the blood bicarbonate buffer system.\n\nWe begin with the provided equilibrium expression for the dissociation of carbonic acid, $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}$:\n$$K_{a} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}][\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}]}$$\nOur goal is to find the $\\mathrm{pH}$, which is defined as $\\mathrm{pH}=-\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H}^{+}])$. Therefore, we must first solve the equilibrium expression for the hydrogen ion concentration, $[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$:\n$$[\\mathrm{H}^{+}] = K_{a} \\frac{[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}]}{[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}$$\nNext, we take the negative base-$10$ logarithm of both sides of this equation:\n$$-\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H}^{+}]) = -\\log_{10}\\left(K_{a} \\frac{[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}]}{[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}\\right)$$\nUsing the definition of $\\mathrm{pH}$ on the left side and the properties of logarithms on the right side ($\\log(ab) = \\log(a) + \\log(b)$), we obtain:\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}(K_{a}) - \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}]}{[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}\\right)$$\nBy definition, $\\mathrm{p}K_{a} = -\\log_{10}(K_{a})$. Also, using the property $-\\log(x/y) = \\log(y/x)$, the equation becomes:\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{p}K_{a} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}]}\\right)$$\nThis is the general form of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nThe concentration of carbonic acid, $[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}]$, is not directly measured. However, the problem states two critical relationships. First, the concentration of carbonic acid is approximately equal to the concentration of dissolved aqueous carbon dioxide due to the rapid hydration equilibrium:\n$$[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}] \\approx [\\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\\mathrm{aq})]$$\nSecond, the concentration of dissolved $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is related to its partial pressure, $P_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, via Henry's Law:\n$$[\\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\\mathrm{aq})] = \\alpha P_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the solubility coefficient.\n\nSubstituting these two relationships into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation yields the specific form for the blood buffer system. First, replace $[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}]$:\n$$\\mathrm{pH} \\approx \\mathrm{p}K_{a} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\\mathrm{aq})]}\\right)$$\nThen, replace $[\\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\\mathrm{aq})]$:\n$$\\mathrm{pH} \\approx \\mathrm{p}K_{a} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}{\\alpha P_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}\\right)$$\nThis is the required expression for $\\mathrm{pH}$ in terms of the given parameters. The value $\\mathrm{p}K_{a} = 6.1$ is an \"apparent\" $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ that specifically accounts for the combined $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\\mathrm{aq}) + \\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ pool being treated as the acid component.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for the patient's blood $\\mathrm{pH}$. The given values are:\n$[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}] = 24\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\n$P_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}} = 40\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n$\\alpha = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{mM/mmHg}$\n$\\mathrm{p}K_{a} = 6.1$\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide, which serves as the acid component in this formulation:\n$$[\\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\\mathrm{aq})] = \\alpha P_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}} = (0.03\\,\\mathrm{mM/mmHg}) \\times (40\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}) = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{mM}$$\nNext, we substitute this value and the bicarbonate concentration into the derived equation:\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = 6.1 + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{24\\,\\mathrm{mM}}{1.2\\,\\mathrm{mM}}\\right)$$\nThe ratio inside the logarithm is:\n$$\\frac{24}{1.2} = 20$$\nSo, the equation simplifies to:\n$$\\mathrm{pH} = 6.1 + \\log_{10}(20)$$\nWe evaluate the logarithm:\n$$\\log_{10}(20) = \\log_{10}(2 \\times 10) = \\log_{10}(2) + \\log_{10}(10) \\approx 0.30103 + 1 = 1.30103$$\nFinally, we compute the $\\mathrm{pH}$:\n$$\\mathrm{pH} \\approx 6.1 + 1.30103 = 7.40103$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

This yield is a function of the number of protons pumped by the electron transport chain, the proton cost of ATP synthesis and transport, and the proton leak.\n\nThe total proton cost, $C_{H,total}$, to synthesize one molecule of ATP and transport the required inorganic phosphate ($P_i$) into the mitochondrial matrix is the sum of the cost for synthesis via ATP synthase and the cost for phosphate transport.\nThe ATP synthase cost is determined by its $c$-ring stoichiometry.
