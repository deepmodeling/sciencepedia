This process, known as thymic selection, ensures that only cells that are both useful (recognizing self-MHC) and safe (not attacking self-antigens) are released. This exercise provides a simplified quantitative model to help you appreciate the stringent nature of this two-step quality control process and understand why only a tiny fraction of initial thymocytes become mature T cells [@problem_id:4857139].", "problem": "A cohort of thymocytes entering maturation in the thymus undergoes two sequential checkpoints that shape the adaptive immune repertoire. In the cortex, thymocytes expressing a T cell receptor (TCR) must demonstrate the capacity to recognize self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules with at least minimal affinity to receive survival signals, a process termed positive selection. In the medulla, thymocytes with TCRs that bind self peptide–MHC complexes with high affinity are eliminated to enforce central tolerance, a process termed negative selection. Consider the following simplified and scientifically plausible model for these sequential events, suitable for approximating expected outcomes in internal medicine contexts concerned with immune competence and autoimmunity risk.\n\nAssume that out of an initial population of thymocytes, a fraction $p_{\\text{pos}}$ passes positive selection in the cortex, and conditional on having passed positive selection, a fraction $p_{\\text{neg-survive}}$ of those thymocytes escape deletion during negative selection in the medulla. Take $p_{\\text{pos}}$ to be $20\\%$ and $p_{\\text{neg-survive}}$ to be $5\\%$.

This is a fundamental and well-established concept in immunology, crucial for understanding the development of adaptive immunity and the establishment of central tolerance. The sequential nature of the events (cortex then medulla) and the specified functions of each selection process (MHC restriction and self-tolerance, respectively) are scientifically accurate. The provided values, while being part of a simplified model, result in a survival rate consistent with the known massive attrition of thymocytes during maturation. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information to calculate the final fraction of surviving cells. The relationship between the two selection events is explicitly defined as sequential and conditional, which removes any ambiguity. The question is clear, and a unique, stable solution can be determined.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise, quantitative, and free of subjective or opinion-based statements. It uses standard scientific terminology.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the defined flaws. It is scientifically valid, complete, consistent, and well-structured.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet $N_0$ represent the size of the initial population of thymocytes entering the selection process.\n\nThe first checkpoint is positive selection. The fraction of thymocytes that pass this stage is given by $p_{\\text{pos}}$. The number of thymocytes remaining after positive selection, which we will denote as $N_1$, is therefore:\n$$N_1 = N_0 \\times p_{\\text{pos}}$$\n\nThe second checkpoint is negative selection. The problem states that a fraction $p_{\\text{neg-survive}}$ of the thymocytes that passed positive selection will survive this second stage. This is a conditional probability. The population entering this stage is $N_1$. Therefore, the number of thymocytes that survive both positive and negative selection, which we will denote as $N_f$ (for final), is:\n$$N_f = N_1 \\times p_{\\text{neg-survive}}$$\n\nTo find the fraction of the initial population that survives both steps, we need to compute the ratio $\\frac{N_f}{N_0}$. We can substitute the expressions for $N_f$ and $N_1$:\n$$\\frac{N_f}{N_0} = \\frac{(N_1 \\times p_{\\text{neg-survive}})}{N_0} = \\frac{(N_0 \\times p_{\\text{pos}} \\times p_{\\text{neg-survive}})}{N_0}$$\n\nThe term $N_0$ cancels out, leaving the expression for the total fraction of survivors, $F_{\\text{survive}}$:\n$$F_{\\text{survive}} = p_{\\text{pos}} \\times p_{\\text{neg-survive}}$$\n\nThe problem provides numerical values for these fractions:\n- $p_{\\text{pos}} = 20\\% = \\frac{20}{100} = \\frac{1}{5}$\n- $p_{\\text{neg-survive}} = 5\\% = \\frac{5}{100} = \\frac{1}{20}$\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the derived formula:\n$$F_{\\text{survive}} = \\frac{1}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{20}$$\n\nMultiplying the fractions yields the final answer:\n$$F_{\\text{survive}} = \\frac{1 \\times 1}{5 \\times 20} = \\frac{1}{100}$$\n\nThus, the expected fraction of the initial thymocyte population that survives both selection checkpoints to mature into naive T cells is $\\frac{1}{100}$. This result aligns with the biological reality that only a very small percentage (typically $1-3\\%$) of thymocytes successfully complete maturation. Our simplified model yields a result of $1\\%$, which is within this plausible range.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{100}}$$", "id": "4857139"}, {"introduction": "A mature T cell encountering its specific antigen is not enough to launch an immune attack; a critical second 'safety' signal is required to confirm a genuine threat. This 'two-signal hypothesis' is a cornerstone of immunology, preventing accidental activation and autoimmunity. This problem challenges you to diagnose a patient's immunodeficiency by pinpointing a failure in this crucial activation handshake, reinforcing the importance of co-stimulation in the adaptive immune response [@problem_id:2320544].", "problem": "A patient is admitted to a hospital with a severe and persistent viral infection that is unresponsive to standard antiviral therapies. An immunological workup reveals that the patient has normal counts of most immune cells, including B lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and potential Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs). The virus is known to replicate within host cells. Lab tests show that Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells, isolated from the patient are capable of phagocytosing the virus, processing it, and presenting viral peptides on their cell surface. However, further functional assays demonstrate a critical failure in the adaptive immune response: the patient's Helper T cells ($T_H$ cells) fail to proliferate and secrete essential cytokines when co-cultured with these virus-presenting APCs. This specific failure of $T_H$ cell activation appears to be the central cause of the patient's inability to clear the infection.\n\nBased on your understanding of the molecular requirements for T-cell activation, which of the following single molecular defects is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?\n\nA. A mutation in the genes encoding the B7 family of co-stimulatory molecules on the patient's APCs, preventing their surface expression.\n\nB. A mutation in the gene encoding the CD28 receptor on the patient's $T_H$ cells, rendering it non-functional and unable to bind its ligand.\n\nC. A systemic defect in the proteasome machinery responsible for degrading cytosolic proteins for loading onto Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules.\n\nD. A genetic inability of the patient's B cells to perform antibody class switching from the Immunoglobulin M (IgM) isotype to other isotypes like IgG.\n\nE.

In the absence of Signal 2, engagement of Signal 1 alone induces anergy, with failure of $T_{H}$ proliferation and cytokine secretion.\n\nIn the vignette, APCs are shown to be capable of phagocytosis, antigen processing, and presentation of viral peptides on their surface, establishing that Signal 1 (peptide presentation on MHC class II) is intact. Despite this, the patient’s $T_{H}$ cells fail to proliferate and secrete cytokines when co-cultured with these antigen-presenting APCs, which is the characteristic outcome of a missing co-stimulatory signal.\n\nEvaluate the options based on these requirements:\n- Option A (loss of B7 on APCs) would eliminate Signal 2 and prevent $T_{H}$ activation despite intact peptide presentation. This is a plausible mechanism.\n- Option B (nonfunctional CD28 on $T_{H}$ cells) also eliminates Signal 2, producing the same phenotype of anergy. Given that APC antigen processing and presentation are explicitly intact, the most parsimonious single molecular defect explaining a $T$ cell–intrinsic failure to respond to otherwise competent APCs is a nonfunctional CD28 receptor on the $T$ cells.\n- Option C (proteasome defect for MHC I) affects the endogenous pathway and CD8 $T$ cell priming via MHC I, not the exogenous/MHC II pathway used to activate $T_{H}$ cells; it does not explain the observed $T_{H}$ activation failure with APCs presenting exogenous viral peptides.\n- Option D (B cell class switching defect) affects antibody isotype production and does not directly account for failure of $T_{H}$ proliferation/cytokine secretion upon APC encounter.\n- Option E (C3 deficiency) impacts opsonization and complement but does not specifically disrupt the co-stimulatory requirements of $T_{H}$ activation.\n\nBoth A and B disrupt the same co-stimulatory axis, but with APC processing/presentation verified as intact, the single molecular defect most directly accounting for the $T_{H}$ cell activation failure is a nonfunctional CD28 receptor on $T_{H}$ cells.\n\nTherefore, the most likely single molecular defect is in CD28 on $T_{H}$ cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2320544"}, {"introduction": "The hallmark of the adaptive immune system is its ability to remember past encounters, a principle that underlies the success of vaccination.
