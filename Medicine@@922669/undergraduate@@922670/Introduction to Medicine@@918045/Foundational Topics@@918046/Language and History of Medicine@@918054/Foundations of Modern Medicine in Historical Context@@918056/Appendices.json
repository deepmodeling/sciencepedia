In epidemiological terms, the risk of a Surgical Site Infection (SSI) in a population of surgical procedures is the incidence proportion, that is, the probability that a procedure results in an infection. Let $p_0$ denote the baseline SSI risk before antisepsis and $p_1$ denote the SSI risk after adopting antisepsis. The Relative Risk Reduction (RRR) is defined as the fraction of baseline risk removed by the intervention, $$\\text{RRR} = \\frac{p_0 - p_1}{p_0}.$$ Assume a surgical ward performs $N = 1{,}000$ procedures per year with a historically plausible baseline SSI risk of $p_0 = 0.16$. Early observational data consistent with Lister’s antisepsis suggest a reduction equivalent to $\\text{RRR} = 0.70$ when carbolic acid is applied uniformly and correctly. Using the above foundational definitions and the assumption that the SSI risk applies identically and independently across procedures with stable case-mix, derive from first principles the expected annual reduction in the number of SSI cases attributable to adopting carbolic acid.

Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe objective is to calculate the expected annual reduction in the number of Surgical Site Infection (SSI) cases. Let this quantity be denoted by $\\Delta C$.\n\nLet $C_0$ be the expected number of SSI cases per year before the introduction of antisepsis, and let $C_1$ be the expected number of SSI cases per year after its introduction. The annual reduction in cases is then the difference between these two expected values:\n$$\n\\Delta C = C_0 - C_1\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the SSI risk, $p$, is an incidence proportion, which is the probability of an infection for a single procedure. The procedures are assumed to be independent events. For a total of $N$ procedures, the number of infections follows a binomial distribution. The expected number of infections is the product of the number of trials ($N$) and the probability of infection per trial ($p$).\n\nTherefore, the expected number of cases before antisepsis is:\n$$\nC_0 = N \\cdot p_0\n$$\nAnd the expected number of cases after antisepsis is:\n$$\nC_1 = N \\cdot p_1\n$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for $\\Delta C$:\n$$\n\\Delta C = N p_0 - N p_1 = N(p_0 - p_1)\n$$\nThis expression, $p_0 - p_1$, is known as the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR).\n\nThe problem provides the Relative Risk Reduction (RRR), which is defined as:\n$$\n\\text{RRR} = \\frac{p_0 - p_1}{p_0}\n$$\nWe can rearrange this definition to solve for the absolute risk reduction, $(p_0 - p_1)$:\n$$\np_0 - p_1 = p_0 \\cdot \\text{RRR}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $(p_0 - p_1)$ back into our equation for the expected reduction in cases, $\\Delta C$:\n$$\n\\Delta C = N (p_0 \\cdot \\text{RRR})\n$$\nThis equation provides the expected annual reduction in the number of cases derived from the first principles and definitions given.\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Total number of procedures per year, $N = 1000$.\n- Baseline SSI risk, $p_0 = 0.16$.\n- Relative Risk Reduction, $\\text{RRR} = 0.70$.\n\nSubstituting these numerical values into the derived formula:\n$$\n\\Delta C = 1000 \\times (0.16 \\times 0.70)\n$$\nFirst, we compute the product inside the parentheses:\n$$\n0.16 \\times 0.70 = 0.112\n$$\nThen, we complete the calculation for $\\Delta C$:\n$$\n\\Delta C = 1000 \\times 0.112 = 112\n$$\nThe expected annual reduction in the number of SSI cases is $112$.

Consider the historical adoption of the Wassermann Reaction (WR) for syphilis in an urban venereal disease clinic during the early twentieth century, where evidence-based reasoning became central to modern medical practice. In this setting, suppose the pretest probability of syphilis in a referred cohort is $P$, and the WR has sensitivity $Se$ and specificity $Sp$. Positive predictive value (PPV) is defined as the posterior probability of disease given a positive test, written $P(\\text{disease} \\mid +)$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of probability theory and its application to medical diagnostics—a standard topic in epidemiology and evidence-based medicine. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and data ($P$, $Se$, $Sp$) to derive and compute the requested quantity. The setup is self-contained, consistent, and objective.\n\nThe central task is to derive the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) from first principles and then calculate its numerical value for a given set of parameters.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has the disease (syphilis), and let $D^c$ be the complementary event that the patient does not have the disease. Let $+$ denote the event of a positive test result.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n1.  The pretest probability of disease, or prevalence: $P(D) = P$\n2.  The sensitivity of the test: $Se = P(+ \\mid D)$, which is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease.\n3.  The specificity of the test: $Sp = P(- \\mid D^c)$, where $-$ is the event of a negative test. This is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease.\n\nThe quantity to be derived is the Positive Predictive Value, $P(\\text{disease} \\mid +)$, which in our notation is $P(D \\mid +)$.\n\nAccording to the definition of conditional probability, which forms the basis of Bayes' theorem, we have:\n$$P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{P(D \\cap +)}{P(+)}$$\nwhere $P(D \\cap +)$ is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive. This can be re-expressed using the definition of conditional probability as $P(D \\cap +) = P(+ \\mid D)P(D)$. Substituting this into the equation gives the common form of Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{P(+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(+)}$$\nThe term in the denominator, $P(+)$, is the total probability of a positive test. We can expand this term using the law of total probability. A positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive ways: the patient has the disease and tests positive (a true positive), or the patient does not have the disease and tests positive (a false positive).\n$$P(+) = P(+\\cap D) + P(+\\cap D^c)$$\nAgain using the definition of conditional probability for each term:\n$$P(+) = P(+ \\mid D)P(D) + P(+ \\mid D^c)P(D^c)$$\nWe can express all terms on the right-hand side using the given parameters $P$, $Se$, and $Sp$.\n- $P(+ \\mid D) = Se$\n- $P(D) = P$\n- $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - P$\n- $P(+ \\mid D^c)$ is the probability of a false positive. It is the complement of the specificity, since for a non-diseased person, the test can only be positive or negative. Thus, $P(+ \\mid D^c) = 1 - P(- \\mid D^c) = 1 - Sp$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(+)$:\n$$P(+) = (Se)(P) + (1 - Sp)(1 - P)$$\nNow we substitute this complete expression for the denominator back into the Bayes' theorem formula for $P(D \\mid +)$:\n$$P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{P(+ \\mid D)P(D)}{(Se)(P) + (1 - Sp)(1 - P)}$$\nIn terms of the given symbolic variables, the final derived expression is:\n$$P(\\text{disease} \\mid +) = \\frac{(Se)(P)}{(Se)(P) + (1 - Sp)(1 - P)}$$\nThis completes the derivation from first principles.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for the specific cohort with the following parameters:\n- $Se = 0.78$\n- $Sp = 0.96$\n- $P = 0.15$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$P(\\text{disease} \\mid +) = \\frac{(0.78)(0.15)}{(0.78)(0.15) + (1 - 0.96)(1 - 0.15)}$$\nWe calculate the components of the expression.\nThe numerator is:\n$$(0.78)(0.15) = 0.117$$\nThe denominator consists of two terms. The first term is identical to the numerator, $0.117$. The second term is:\n$$(1 - 0.96)(1 - 0.15) = (0.04)(0.85) = 0.034$$\nThe total value of the denominator is the sum of these two terms:\n$$P(+) = 0.117 + 0.034 = 0.151$$\nFinally, we compute the ratio:\n$$P(\\text{disease} \\mid +) = \\frac{0.117}{0.151} \\approx 0.774834437...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Inspecting the result, the first four significant digits are $7$, $7$, $4$, and $8$.
