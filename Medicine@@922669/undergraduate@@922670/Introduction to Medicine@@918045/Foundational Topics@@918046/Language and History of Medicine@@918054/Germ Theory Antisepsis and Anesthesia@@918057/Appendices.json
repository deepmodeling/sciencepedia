The problem states that the agents act independently and sequentially, and that the overall effect is multiplicative on survival fractions. The survival fraction for step 1 is $S_1 = N_1/N_0$ and for step 2 is $S_2 = N_2/N_1$. The total survival fraction is $S_{\\text{total}} = N_2/N_0 = S_1 S_2$. This is equivalent to stating that the total reduction ratio is the product of the individual reduction ratios.
