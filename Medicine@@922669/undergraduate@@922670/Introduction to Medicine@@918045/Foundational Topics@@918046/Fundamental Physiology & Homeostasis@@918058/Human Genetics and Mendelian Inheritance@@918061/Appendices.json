It describes a standard scenario in transmission genetics. The concepts of linkage, repulsion phase, and recombination fraction are fundamental to the field. The provided value for the recombination fraction, $\\theta = 0.1$, is biologically plausible. The assumptions are standard for simplifying the model to its core principles. The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information to derive a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of Gamete Frequencies\nThe parent is a double heterozygote with genotype $A/a$ and $B/b$. The loci are linked on a single chromosome pair. The problem specifies that the alleles are in repulsion phase. This means one homologous chromosome carries the alleles $A$ and $b$, while the other carries the alleles $a$ and $B$. We can represent the parental chromosome pair as $(A b) / (a B)$.\n\nDuring meiosis, gametes are formed. These gametes can be of two classes: parental (non-recombinant) and recombinant.\n\n1.  **Parental (Non-Recombinant) Gametes**: These are produced when no crossing over occurs between the $A$ and $B$ loci on the homologous chromosomes. The resulting gametes will carry the original combinations of alleles present on the parental chromosomes.\n    The parental gametes are therefore $A b$ and $a B$.\n\n2.  **Recombinant Gametes**: These are produced when a crossover event occurs between the two loci. A crossover results in the exchange of genetic material between the homologous chromosomes, creating new combinations of alleles.\n    A crossover between the $A$ and $B$ loci on the $(A b) / (a B)$ chromosome pair will produce recombinant chromatids carrying $A B$ and $a b$. The gametes formed from these chromatids are $A B$ and $a b$.\n\nThe recombination fraction, denoted by $\\theta$, is defined as the proportion of total gametes that are of the recombinant type.\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{\\text{Number of recombinant offspring}}{\\text{Total number of offspring}} $$\nIn this problem, we are given $\\theta = 0.1$. This means that $10\\%$ of the gametes produced will be recombinant.\n\nThe total probability of all gametes must sum to $1$.\nThe total frequency of recombinant gametes is $P(\\text{recombinant}) = \\theta$.\nThe two recombinant gamete types, $A B$ and $a b$, are produced in equal frequencies due to the symmetry of meiotic crossover. Therefore, the probability of each is:\n$$ P(A B) = P(a b) = \\frac{\\theta}{2} $$\nSubstituting the given value $\\theta = 0.1$:\n$$ P(A B) = P(a b) = \\frac{0.1}{2} = 0.05 $$\n\nThe total frequency of parental (non-recombinant) gametes is the remaining proportion:\n$$ P(\\text{parental}) = 1 - \\theta $$\nThe two parental gamete types, $A b$ and $a B$, are also produced in equal frequencies.

Two pure-breeding lines are crossed: one is homozygous dominant at both loci with genotype $AABB$ and the other is homozygous recessive at both loci with genotype $aabb$. Both loci are autosomal, each dominant allele ($A$ or $B$) is completely dominant over its recessive counterpart ($a$ or $b$), there is no selection, and meioses are fair. The cross produces the first filial generation (F1), which is then self-fertilized to produce the second filial generation (F2).

All terms are clearly defined, the initial conditions are specified, and the problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is a valid problem for which a rigorous derivation can be performed.\n\nLet the alleles at the two autosomal loci be denoted by `$A$` and `$a$`, and `$B$` and `$b$`. The parental cross is between two pure-breeding lines, `$AABB \\times aabb$`. The `$AABB$` parent produces only `$AB$` gametes, and the `$aabb$` parent produces only `$ab$` gametes. Therefore, the first filial (F1) generation consists entirely of individuals with the genotype `$AaBb$`. The problem correctly states that these individuals are in coupling phase, meaning their parental haplotypes are `$AB$` and `$ab$`, which can be represented as `$AB/ab$`. The F1 individuals are then self-fertilized (`$AaBb \\times AaBb$`) to produce the second filial (F2) generation.\n\n**1) Independent Assortment ($\\theta = 0.5$)**\n\nUnder the law of independent assortment, the segregation of alleles at the `$A$` locus is independent of the segregation of alleles at the `$B$` locus. For a heterozygous individual `$AaBb$`, the law of segregation implies that gametes will contain allele `$A$` with probability `$1/2$` and allele `$a$` with probability `$1/2$`. Similarly, gametes will contain allele `$B$` with probability `$1/2$` and allele `$b$` with probability `$1/2$`.\n\nThe frequencies of the four possible gamete types are found by multiplying the probabilities of the constituent alleles:\n-   Frequency of `$AB$` gamete: `$P(AB) = P(A) \\times P(B) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$`\n-   Frequency of `$Ab$` gamete: `$P(Ab) = P(A) \\times P(b) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$`\n-   Frequency of `$aB$` gamete: `$P(aB) = P(a) \\times P(B) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$`\n-   Frequency of `$ab$` gamete: `$P(ab) = P(a) \\times P(b) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$`\n\nThe parental gamete types for the `$AB/ab$` heterozygote are `$AB$` and `$ab$`. The recombinant gamete types are `$Ab$` and `$aB$`. The recombination fraction `$\\theta$` is the total frequency of recombinant gametes, which is `$P(Ab) + P(aB) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 = 0.5$`. This confirms that independent assortment corresponds to `$\\theta = 0.5$`.\n\nTo find the F2 phenotypic proportions, we can consider each locus independently. For a monohybrid cross `$Aa \\times Aa$`, the genotypic proportions are `$1/4 AA$`, `$1/2 Aa$`, and `$1/4 aa$`. Due to complete dominance, the phenotypic proportions are:\n-   `$P(A{-}) = P(AA) + P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$`\n-   `$P(aa) = \\frac{1}{4}$`\nSimilarly, for the cross `$Bb \\times Bb$`:\n-   `$P(B{-}) = \\frac{3}{4}$`\n-   `$P(bb) = \\frac{1}{4}$`\n\nSince the loci assort independently, we multiply these probabilities to find the F2 dihybrid phenotypic proportions:\n-   `$P(A{-}B{-}) = P(A{-}) \\times P(B{-}) = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{9}{16}$`\n-   `$P(A{-}bb) = P(A{-}) \\times P(bb) = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{16}$`\n-   `$P(aaB{-}) = P(aa) \\times P(B{-}) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3}{16}$`\n-   `$P(aabb) = P(aa) \\times P(bb) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$`\nThese proportions `$9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16$` correspond to the classical `$9{:}3{:}3{:}1$` phenotypic ratio.\n\n**2) Linked Loci ($0 \\le \\theta < 0.5$)**\n\nWhen the loci are linked, the law of independent assortment does not apply. We must derive the gamete frequencies from the definition of the recombination fraction `$\\theta$`, which is the probability that a gamete is recombinant. The F1 individual is `$AaBb$` in coupling phase (`$AB/ab$`).\n\n-   The parental gametes are `$AB$` and `$ab$`. The total probability of producing a parental gamete is `$1 - \\theta$`. Since meiosis is fair, these are produced in equal frequencies:\n    `$P(AB) = P(ab) = \\frac{1-\\theta}{2}$`\n-   The recombinant gametes are `$Ab$` and `$aB$`. The total probability of producing a recombinant gamete is `$\\theta$`. These are also produced in equal frequencies:\n    `$P(Ab) = P(aB) = \\frac{\\theta}{2}$`\n\nThe F2 generation is formed by the random fusion of these gametes during self-fertilization. We calculate the probability of each phenotype by summing the probabilities of the genotypes that produce it.\n\n-   **Phenotype `$aabb$`**: This phenotype corresponds to a single genotype, `$aabb$`. It is formed by the fusion of two `$ab$` gametes.\n    `$P(aabb) = P(ab) \\times P(ab) = \\left(\\frac{1-\\theta}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1-\\theta}{2}\\right) = \\frac{(1-\\theta)^2}{4}$`.\n\n-   **Phenotype `$A{-}bb$`**: This phenotype arises from genotypes `$AAbb$` and `$Aabb$`.\n    `$P(AAbb) = P(Ab) \\times P(Ab) = \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\theta^2}{4}$`.\n    `$P(Aabb) = P(Ab) \\times P(ab) + P(ab) \\times P(Ab) = 2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1-\\theta}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2\\theta(1-\\theta)}{4}$`.\n    Summing these gives: `$P(A{-}bb) = \\frac{\\theta^2}{4} + \\frac{2\\theta(1-\\theta)}{4} = \\frac{\\theta^2 + 2\\theta - 2\\theta^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\theta - \\theta^2}{4}$`.\n\n-   **Phenotype `$aaB{-}$`**: This phenotype arises from genotypes `$aaBB$` and `$aaBb$`.\n    `$P(aaBB) = P(aB) \\times P(aB) = \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\theta^2}{4}$`.\n    `$P(aaBb) = P(aB) \\times P(ab) + P(ab) \\times P(aB) = 2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1-\\theta}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2\\theta(1-\\theta)}{4}$`.\n    Summing these gives: `$P(aaB{-}) = \\frac{\\theta^2}{4} + \\frac{2\\theta(1-\\theta)}{4} = \\frac{\\theta^2 + 2\\theta - 2\\theta^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\theta - \\theta^2}{4}$`.\n\n-   **Phenotype `$A{-}B{-}$`**: The probabilities of all four mutually exclusive phenotypes must sum to `$1$`. We can find an expression for `$P(A{-}B{-})$` by subtraction:\n    `$P(A{-}B{-}) = 1 - P(A{-}bb) - P(aaB{-}) - P(aabb)$`.\n    `$P(A{-}B{-}) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{2\\theta - \\theta^2}{4}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{2\\theta - \\theta^2}{4}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{(1-\\theta)^2}{4}\\right)$`.\n    `$P(A{-}B{-}) = \\frac{4 - (2\\theta - \\theta^2) - (2\\theta - \\theta^2) - (1 - 2\\theta + \\theta^2)}{4}$`.\n    `$P(A{-}B{-}) = \\frac{4 - 2\\theta + \\theta^2 - 2\\theta + \\theta^2 - 1 + 2\\theta - \\theta^2}{4}$`.\n    `$P(A{-}B{-}) = \\frac{(4-1) + (-2\\theta - 2\\theta + 2\\theta) + (\\theta^2 + \\theta^2 - \\theta^2)}{4}$`.\n    `$P(A{-}B{-}) = \\frac{3 - 2\\theta + \\theta^2}{4}$`.\n\nThe derived phenotypic proportions for the F2 generation, expressed as functions of the recombination fraction `$\\theta$`, are:\n-   `$P(A{-}B{-}) = \\frac{3 - 2\\theta + \\theta^2}{4}$`\n-   `$P(A{-}bb) = \\frac{2\\theta - \\theta^2}{4}$`\n-   `$P(aaB{-}) = \\frac{2\\theta - \\theta^2}{4}$`\n-   `$P(aabb) = \\frac{1 - 2\\theta + \\theta^2}{4} = \\frac{(1-\\theta)^2}{4}$`\n\nThese expressions are the required closed-form solutions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{3 - 2\\theta + \\theta^2}{4} & \\frac{2\\theta - \\theta^2}{4} & \\frac{2\\theta - \\theta^2}{4} & \\frac{(1-\\theta)^2}{4}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4964184"}, {"introduction": "Genetic diagnosis is often a puzzle where not all information is clear, forcing clinicians to weigh multiple possibilities.

There are no contradictions or missing pieces of information that would prevent a rigorous analysis. I will proceed to the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe central task is to evaluate which observation most strongly supports one of two competing hypotheses for the proband's hearing loss.\n\n**Hypothesis 1: Genetic Expression ($H_G$)**\nThe proband carries the familial autosomal dominant allele (genotype, say, $Aa$) and the hearing loss is a result of this allele being expressed (i.e., penetrant). The aminoglycoside exposure is coincidental.\n\n**Hypothesis 2: Phenocopy ($H_P$)**\nThe proband does not carry the familial allele (genotype $aa$). The hearing loss is a phenocopy, caused entirely by the environmental exposure to aminoglycosides.\n\nThe observation that \"most strongly supports\" $H_P$ is the one that is least likely to have occurred if $H_G$ were true. We will analyze each option by calculating or estimating the probability of observing it, given that $H_G$ is true. A very low probability would cast significant doubt on $H_G$ and thus provide strong support for the alternative, $H_P$.\n\n**Option A: Observing $0$ affected offspring among $8$ children of the proband with an unaffected, unrelated spouse, given an estimated penetrance $p = 0.7$ for carriers in this family.**\n\nLet's calculate the probability of this observation under $H_G$.\n1.  If the proband's hearing loss is due to the familial allele ($H_G$), their genotype is $Aa$.\n2.  The spouse is healthy and unrelated, so we assume their genotype is $aa$.\n3.  The probability of the proband passing the causal allele ($A$) to any child is $1/2$.\n4.  The probability that a child who inherits the allele ($A$) will be affected is the penetrance, $p = 0.7$.\n5.  Therefore, the probability that any single child is affected is the product of these probabilities: $P(\\text{child affected}) = P(\\text{inherits } A) \\times P(\\text{is affected} | \\text{has } A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.7 = 0.35$.\n6.  The probability that a single child is unaffected is $P(\\text{child unaffected}) = 1 - P(\\text{child affected}) = 1 - 0.35 = 0.65$.\n7.  Assuming each birth is an independent event, the probability of having $8$ consecutive unaffected children is:\n    $$P(\\text{Observation A} | H_G) = (0.65)^8 \\approx 0.03186$$\n    This is approximately a $3.2\\%$ probability. An event with such a low probability is surprising and constitutes strong evidence against the hypothesis ($H_G$) under which it was calculated. Under the phenocopy hypothesis ($H_P$), the proband's genotype is $aa$, so all children will be $aa$ and unaffected by the familial gene. The probability of having $8$ unaffected children is $1$. The large discrepancy in probabilities makes this observation strong support for $H_P$.\n\n**Verdict for Option A:** The probability of this observation under the genetic hypothesis is very low ($P \\approx 0.032$). This provides strong statistical evidence against the genetic hypothesis and, in turn, strong support for the phenocopy hypothesis. **This is a strong candidate.**\n\n**Option B: The proband’s monozygotic twin (genetically identical) did not receive aminoglycosides and has normal hearing, while the proband is affected.**\n\nLet's calculate the probability of this observation under $H_G$.\n1.  Monozygotic (MZ) twins are genetically identical. If the proband is a carrier ($Aa$) under $H_G$, the twin must also be a carrier ($Aa$).\n2.  The observation is that the proband is affected and the twin is unaffected. This is a case of phenotypic discordance.\n3.  Under $H_G$, this discordance is explained by incomplete penetrance. The aminoglycoside exposure is considered irrelevant to the cause.\n4.  The probability that the proband is affected (penetrant) is $p = 0.7$.\n5.  The probability that the twin is unaffected (non-penetrant) is $1-p = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3$.\n6.  The probability of this specific combination (proband affected, twin unaffected) occurring in an MZ twin pair of carriers is:\n    $$P(\\text{Observation B} | H_G) = p \\times (1-p) = 0.7 \\times 0.3 = 0.21$$\n    This is a $21\\%$ probability. An event with a $21\\%$ chance is not particularly rare and is quite consistent with the genetic hypothesis of incomplete penetrance. While the observation is perfectly explained by the phenocopy hypothesis ($H_P$), it does not strongly discredit the genetic hypothesis ($H_G$).\n\n**Verdict for Option B:** The probability of this observation under the genetic hypothesis is reasonably high ($P = 0.21$). Therefore, it provides only weak evidence against the genetic hypothesis. **Incorrect.**\n\n**Option C: The proband’s hearing loss began at a younger age than that of other affected relatives in the family.**\n\nThis observation relates to the concept of variable expressivity, where a single genetic condition can manifest differently among individuals, including variations in the age of onset. While a significant deviation in onset age can suggest a different etiology (like a phenocopy), many dominant disorders naturally have a wide range of onset ages. Without knowing the typical range for this specific familial disorder, it is impossible to quantify how unusual this observation is. It is suggestive but is considered weak, qualitative evidence compared to the statistical evidence in A and B.\n\n**Verdict for Option C:** This provides weak, non-quantifiable evidence and is less compelling than a statistically rare outcome. **Incorrect.**\n\n**Option D: A neighbor with no family history of hearing loss received aminoglycosides and subsequently developed hearing loss.**\n\nThis observation confirms a general medical fact: aminoglycosides can be ototoxic. This supports the biological plausibility of the phenocopy hypothesis ($H_P$). However, it provides no specific information about the proband. The fact that the drug can cause the phenotype in an unrelated person does not help distinguish whether the proband's phenotype is genetic or environmental. This is the weakest form of evidence, as it is external to the family being studied.\n\n**Verdict for Option D:** This provides no direct evidence pertinent to the proband's specific case. **Incorrect.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options, we seek the one that provides the strongest evidence for the phenocopy hypothesis ($H_P$). This corresponds to the observation that is least likely under the genetic hypothesis ($H_G$).\n-   $P(\\text{Observation A} | H_G) \\approx 0.032$ (or $3.2\\%$)\n-   $P(\\text{Observation B} | H_G) = 0.21$ (or $21\\%$)\n-   $P(\\text{Observation C} | H_G)$ is unknown but qualitatively weak.\n-   $P(\\text{Observation D} | H_G)$ is irrelevant to the proband's case.\n\nThe probability of observing $0$ affected children out of $8$ under the genetic hypothesis is much lower than the probability of observing a discordant monozygotic twin. Therefore, Observation A is a much more surprising result if the cause is genetic, and it provides the strongest statistical support for the alternative phenocopy hypothesis.\nCorrect.\nIncorrect.\nIncorrect.\nIncorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4964153"}]}
