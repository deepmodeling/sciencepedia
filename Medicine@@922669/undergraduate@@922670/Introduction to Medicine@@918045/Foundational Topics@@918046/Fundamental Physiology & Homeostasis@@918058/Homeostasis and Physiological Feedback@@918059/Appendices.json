The controller (chemoreflex) detects the deviation of the signal $x(t)$ from its setpoint (which is $0$ in this linearized model) and commands a change in ventilation to correct it. In a standard negative feedback configuration, the controller's command is proportional to the error signal, which is $0 - x(t) = -x(t)$. The command signal is thus $-Kx(t)$, where $K$ is the loop gain. This command is the input to the plant (the respiratory and circulatory system).\n\nThe plant filters this command and transports it to the chemoreceptor site. The plant's dynamics are described by a first-order low-pass filter with time constant $\\tau$ and a pure transport delay $T$. The output of the plant is the chemoreceptor signal $x(t)$. The relationship between the plant's input, $u(t) = -Kx(t)$, and its output, $x(t)$, can be described by a delay differential equation (DDE). The transfer function of the plant is $P(s) = \\frac{1}{1+\\tau s}e^{-sT}$. The closed-loop system is described by the equation $x(t) = P(s)[-Kx(t)]$. In the Laplace domain, this is $X(s) = -K P(s) X(s)$, which gives the characteristic equation of the closed-loop system:\n$$1 + K P(s) = 0$$\n$$1 + \\frac{K e^{-sT}}{1+\\tau s} = 0$$\nMultiplying by $1+\\tau s$ and transforming back to the time domain yields the governing linearized DDE:\n$$\\tau \\frac{dx(t)}{dt} + x(t) + K x(t-T) = 0$$\n\nFirst, we explain the mechanism of instability. According to the Nyquist stability criterion, a negative feedback loop becomes unstable if the open-loop transfer function $G_{OL}(s) = K P(s)$ has a magnitude greater than or equal to $1$ at the frequency where it introduces a phase shift of $-\\pi$ radians ($-180^\\circ$). At this phase shift, the negative feedback effectively turns into positive feedback, amplifying any oscillations.\nThe open-loop frequency response is found by setting $s=j\\omega$:\n$$G_{OL}(j\\omega) = \\frac{K e^{-j\\omega T}}{1+j\\omega\\tau}$$\nThe phase lag of this system, $\\Phi(\\omega) = \\arg(G_{OL}(j\\omega))$, has two components:\n1.  The lag from the first-order filter: $\\phi_{\\text{filter}}(\\omega) = -\\arctan(\\omega\\tau)$. This lag varies from $0$ to $-\\pi/2$ as $\\omega$ increases.\n2.  The lag from the pure time delay: $\\phi_{\\text{delay}}(\\omega) = -\\omega T$. This lag increases linearly and without bound as $\\omega$ increases.\n\nThe total phase lag is $\\Phi(\\omega) = -\\arctan(\\omega\\tau) - \\omega T$. A large transport delay $T$ is critical because it introduces a significant phase lag, $\\phi_{\\text{delay}}$, making it possible for the total lag $\\Phi(\\omega)$ to reach $-\\pi$ at a relatively low frequency $\\omega$. The controller, acting on this significantly delayed information, applies a corrective action that is out of phase with the current state of the system, thereby reinforcing the error instead of correcting it. A large loop gain $K$ increases the magnitude of the open-loop response, $|G_{OL}(j\\omega)| = \\frac{K}{\\sqrt{1+(\\omega\\tau)^2}}$. If the gain $K$ is sufficiently large, the magnitude condition $|G_{OL}(j\\omega)| \\geq 1$ will be met at the critical frequency where the phase lag is $-\\pi$. This ensures that the mistimed corrective action is strong enough to overcome the natural damping of the system, leading to sustained or growing oscillations, which manifest as CSR.\n\nNext, we derive the conditions for marginal (self-sustained) oscillations. Marginal oscillations occur when a pair of the system's poles lies exactly on the imaginary axis of the complex plane, i.e., $s = j\\omega$ for a real-valued angular frequency $\\omega > 0$. This corresponds to the Nyquist criterion boundary condition, $G_{OL}(j\\omega) = -1$.\n$$G_{OL}(j\\omega) = \\frac{K e^{-j\\omega T}}{1+j\\omega\\tau} = -1$$\nThis single complex equation can be separated into two real equations by considering its magnitude and phase:\n1.  **Magnitude Condition**: $|G_{OL}(j\\omega)| = |-1| = 1$.\n    $$\\left| \\frac{K e^{-j\\omega T}}{1+j\\omega\\tau} \\right| = \\frac{|K| |e^{-j\\omega T}|}{|1+j\\omega\\tau|} = \\frac{K}{\\sqrt{1+(\\omega\\tau)^2}} = 1$$\n    This gives the condition $K^2 = 1+(\\omega\\tau)^2$, which implies $\\omega\\tau = \\sqrt{K^2-1}$ (since $\\omega, \\tau > 0$, we require $K>1$ for a real solution).\n\n2.  **Phase Condition**: $\\arg(G_{OL}(j\\omega)) = \\arg(-1) = -\\pi$ (considering the principal crossing).\n    $$\\arg(K) + \\arg(e^{-j\\omega T}) + \\arg\\left(\\frac{1}{1+j\\omega\\tau}\\right) = -\\pi$$\n    $$0 - \\omega T - \\arctan(\\omega\\tau) = -\\pi$$\n    $$\\omega T + \\arctan(\\omega\\tau) = \\pi$$\n\nThese two equations, $\\omega\\tau = \\sqrt{K^2-1}$ and $\\omega T + \\arctan(\\omega\\tau) = \\pi$, represent the conditions for marginal oscillation. To find an expression for $\\omega$ in terms of $K$, $\\tau$, and $T$, we can substitute the first condition into the second:\n$$\\omega T + \\arctan(\\sqrt{K^2-1}) = \\pi$$\nSolving for $\\omega$, we obtain the expression for the angular frequency of the self-sustained oscillations:\n$$\\omega = \\frac{\\pi - \\arctan(\\sqrt{K^2-1})}{T}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the predicted marginal oscillation angular frequency $\\omega$ for the given parameter values: $K=\\sqrt{5}$, $\\tau=10\\,\\text{s}$, and $T=10.172\\,\\text{s}$.\nFirst, we evaluate the term inside the arctangent:\n$$\\sqrt{K^2-1} = \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{5})^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{5-1} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$$\nNow, substitute this value and the other parameters into the expression for $\\omega$.
