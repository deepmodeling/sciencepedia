The disease is characterized by a long duration, often lasting for several years before spontaneous recovery, if any. A revolutionary new oral medication, \"Rapicurin,\" is developed and made widely available to the population. This drug is highly effective, curing an infected individual of CTLS within 48 hours of starting treatment. Assuming the underlying transmission rate of the pathogen causing CTLS does not change, what is the most likely immediate effect on the disease's incidence and prevalence in the weeks following the widespread introduction of Rapicurin?\n\nA. Prevalence will decrease, while incidence will remain relatively unchanged.\n\nB. Both incidence and prevalence will decrease significantly.\n\nC. Prevalence will decrease, while incidence will increase.\n\nD. Incidence will decrease, while prevalence will remain relatively unchanged.\n\nE. Both incidence and prevalence will remain relatively unchanged.", "solution": "We first define the epidemiologic quantities of interest:\n- Incidence is the rate at which new cases arise per unit time in the at-risk population, determined by transmission dynamics (contact rate and per-contact transmission probability).\n- Prevalence is the proportion (or number) of persons in the population who have the disease at a given time.\n\nIn a stable endemic situation with approximately constant inflow and outflow of cases, the standard steady-state relation holds:\n$$\n\\text{prevalence} \\approx \\text{incidence} \\times \\text{average duration}.\n$$\nLet $p$ denote prevalence (as a proportion), $i$ denote incidence rate, and $d$ denote the average duration of disease. Then the steady-state relation can be written as\n$$\np \\approx i d.\n$$\n\nRapicurin reduces the average duration $d$ from several years to approximately $2$ days, i.e., a very large reduction in $d$. Because $p \\approx i d$, a sharp drop in $d$ yields a sharp decrease in $p$ in the immediate period after introduction, as existing cases are rapidly cured and exit the pool of prevalent cases. Thus, the immediate effect on prevalence is a substantial decrease.\n\nFor incidence, we use the premise: “Assuming the underlying transmission rate of the pathogen does not change.” The “underlying transmission rate” refers to the per-contact transmission probability and contact structure that generate new infections; these determine $i$ in the short term. A therapeutic that cures infected individuals rapidly affects the duration of infection (and thus the stock of prevalent cases) but does not directly alter the instantaneous risk of acquisition per contact at the moment of its introduction. Therefore, in the immediate weeks following introduction, the incidence rate of new infections will remain relatively unchanged, even though over a longer horizon it may decrease as the infectious period shortens and the pool of infectious individuals diminishes.\n\nHence, in the immediate term: prevalence decreases, while incidence remains relatively unchanged.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2087552"}, {"introduction": "While incidence provides a measure of new disease events, calculating it accurately requires more than just counting cases.

On January $1$, there are $12{,}000$ adults who are confirmed to be free of the disease. The follow-up period runs from January $1$ through December $31$ of the same non-leap year. Use only the core definitions of incidence rate and person-time from epidemiology.\n\nOver the year, the following events occur, with times specified relative to the start of follow-up. All counts refer to distinct individuals; no individual experiences more than one event. Individuals who develop the disease are considered to have the event at the instant listed and no longer contribute time at risk thereafter. Individuals who emigrate or die before developing the disease are censored at the instant listed and contribute time at risk up to that point.

The total number of incident cases, $I$, is the sum of these cases.\n-   Cases at the end of March: $40$\n-   Cases at the end of June: $60$\n-   Cases at the end of September: $50$\n-   Cases at the end of December: $30$\n\nThe total number of new cases is:\n$$\nI = 40 + 60 + 50 + 30 = 180\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Person-Time at Risk ($PT$)**\n\nPerson-time is the sum of the time each individual was followed and remained at risk of developing the disease. An individual stops contributing person-time once they develop the disease or are censored (lost to follow-up due to emigration or death from other causes).\n\nThe initial population at risk is $N_0 = 12{,}000$. We can calculate the total person-time by summing the contributions from three distinct groups within the cohort:\n1.  Individuals who completed the full year of follow-up without developing the disease or being censored.\n2.  Individuals who developed the disease (incident cases).\n3.  Individuals who were censored.\n\nFirst, let's determine the size of each group.\n-   Total incident cases: $I = 180$.\n-   Total individuals censored: The problem states $200$ emigrated at the end of April, $150$ emigrated at the end of August, and $120$ died of other causes at the end of October.\n    $$\n    C_{total} = 200 + 150 + 120 = 470\n    $$\n-   Number of individuals completing the full year at risk: This is the initial population minus those who became a case or were censored.\n    $$\n    N_{complete} = N_0 - I - C_{total} = 12{,}000 - 180 - 470 = 11{,}350\n    $$\n\nNow, we calculate the person-time contribution from each group, with time measured in years.\n-   **Person-time from individuals who completed the full year ($PT_{complete}$):**\n    These $11{,}350$ individuals were at risk for the entire $1$-year period.\n    $$\n    PT_{complete} = 11{,}350 \\text{ persons} \\times 1 \\text{ year} = 11{,}350 \\text{ person-years}\n    $$\n\n-   **Person-time from incident cases ($PT_{cases}$):**\n    Each case contributes person-time from the start of the study until the moment they are diagnosed.\n    -   $40$ cases at time $t = 3/12$ years: $40 \\times \\frac{3}{12} = 10$ person-years.\n    -   $60$ cases at time $t = 6/12$ years: $60 \\times \\frac{6}{12} = 30$ person-years.\n    -   $50$ cases at time $t = 9/12$ years: $50 \\times \\frac{9}{12} = 37.5$ person-years.\n    -   $30$ cases at time $t = 12/12$ years: $30 \\times \\frac{12}{12} = 30$ person-years.\n    The total person-time from cases is the sum:\n    $$\n    PT_{cases} = 10 + 30 + 37.5 + 30 = 107.5 \\text{ person-years}\n    $$\n\n-   **Person-time from censored individuals ($PT_{censored}$):**\n    Each censored individual contributes person-time from the start of the study until the moment they are lost to follow-up.\n    -   $200$ censored at time $t = 4/12$ years: $200 \\times \\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{800}{12} = \\frac{200}{3}$ person-years.\n    -   $150$ censored at time $t = 8/12$ years: $150 \\times \\frac{8}{12} = 100$ person-years.\n    -   $120$ censored at time $t = 10/12$ years: $120 \\times \\frac{10}{12} = 100$ person-years.\n    The total person-time from censored individuals is the sum:\n    $$\n    PT_{censored} = \\frac{200}{3} + 100 + 100 = 200 + \\frac{200}{3} = \\frac{600}{3} + \\frac{200}{3} = \\frac{800}{3} \\text{ person-years}\n    $$\n\n-   **Total Person-Time ($PT$):**\n    The total person-time at risk for the cohort is the sum of the contributions from all three groups.\n    $$\n    PT = PT_{complete} + PT_{cases} + PT_{censored} = 11{,}350 + 107.5 + \\frac{800}{3}\n    $$\n    To sum these precisely, we use fractions: $107.5 = \\frac{215}{2}$.\n    $$\n    PT = 11{,}350 + \\frac{215}{2} + \\frac{800}{3} = \\frac{11{,}350 \\times 6}{6} + \\frac{215 \\times 3}{6} + \\frac{800 \\times 2}{6}\n    $$\n    $$\n    PT = \\frac{68{,}100 + 645 + 1{,}600}{6} = \\frac{70{,}345}{6} \\text{ person-years}\n    $$\n\n**Step 3: Compute the Final Incidence Rate**\n\nNow we compute the incidence rate using the total cases $I=180$ and total person-time $PT = \\frac{70{,}345}{6}$ person-years.\n$$\nIR = \\frac{I}{PT} = \\frac{180}{\\frac{70{,}345}{6}} = \\frac{180 \\times 6}{70{,}345} = \\frac{1{,}080}{70{,}345} \\text{ cases per person-year}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the rate per $1{,}000$ person-years.
