It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The definitions and data provided are standard in the field of epidemiology.\n\nThe following data are given:\n- Number of participants in the exposed group at baseline: $N_e = 200$.\n- Number of participants in the unexposed group at baseline: $N_u = 300$.\n- Number of incident cases of dermatitis in the exposed group over $1$ year: $I_e = 30$.\n- Number of incident cases of dermatitis in the unexposed group over $1$ year: $I_u = 10$.\nThe study is a closed cohort with no losses to follow-up and no competing risks.\n\nWe will now compute the requested measures.\n\n1.  **Cumulative Incidence in the Exposed Group ($\\text{CI}_e$)**\n    The cumulative incidence (CI), also known as risk, is defined as the proportion of individuals in a population, initially free of a disease, who develop the disease over a specified period.\n    The formula is:\n    $$ \\text{CI} = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases}}{\\text{Number of individuals at risk at the start of the period}} $$\n    For the exposed group:\n    $$ \\text{CI}_e = \\frac{I_e}{N_e} = \\frac{30}{200} = 0.15 $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, we get $0.1500$.\n\n2.  **Cumulative Incidence in the Unexposed Group ($\\text{CI}_u$)**\n    Using the same formula for the unexposed group:\n    $$ \\text{CI}_u = \\frac{I_u}{N_u} = \\frac{10}{300} = \\frac{1}{30} \\approx 0.033333... $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, we get $0.03333$.\n\n3.  **Relative Risk (RR)**\n    The relative risk is the ratio of the risk of an outcome in the exposed group to the risk of the outcome in the unexposed group.\n    The formula is:\n    $$ RR = \\frac{\\text{CI}_e}{\\text{CI}_u} $$\n    Using the unrounded values for precision:\n    $$ RR = \\frac{0.15}{1/30} = 0.15 \\times 30 = 4.5 $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, we get $4.500$.\n\n4.  **Risk Difference (RD)**\n    The risk difference, also known as the attributable risk, is the absolute difference in risk between the exposed and unexposed groups.\n    The formula is:\n    $$ RD = \\text{CI}_e - \\text{CI}_u $$\n    Using the unrounded values for precision:\n    $$ RD = 0.15 - \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{4.5}{30} - \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{3.5}{30} = \\frac{7}{60} \\approx 0.116666... $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, we get $0.1167$.\n\n5.  **Number Needed to Treat (NNT) or Number Needed to Harm (NNH)**\n    The risk difference is positive ($RD > 0$), indicating that the exposure is associated with an increased risk of dermatitis.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution proceeds by first defining the fundamental quantities of risk and risk ratio, then applying these definitions to compute the stratum-specific, crude, and adjusted measures of association.\n\nThe risk, or incidence proportion, is the probability of developing the outcome over a specified time period. It is calculated as:\n$$\n\\text{Risk} = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases}}{\\text{Total number of individuals at risk}}\n$$\nThe risk ratio ($RR$) is the ratio of the risk in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group:\n$$\nRR = \\frac{\\text{Risk in exposed}}{\\text{Risk in unexposed}} = \\frac{R_E}{R_U}\n$$\n\n**1. Stratum-Specific Risks and Risk Ratios**\n\nFor each age stratum, we calculate the risk of dermatitis in the exposed and unexposed groups and the corresponding risk ratio.\n\n**Stratum 1: Age $ 50$ years**\n- Risk in exposed ($R_{E1}$):\n$$\nR_{E1} = \\frac{40}{40 + 160} = \\frac{40}{200} = 0.2\n$$\n- Risk in unexposed ($R_{U1}$):\n$$\nR_{U1} = \\frac{30}{30 + 270} = \\frac{30}{300} = 0.1\n$$\n- Stratum-specific risk ratio ($RR_1$):\n$$\nRR_1 = \\frac{R_{E1}}{R_{U1}} = \\frac{0.2}{0.1} = 2.0\n$$\n\n**Stratum 2: Age $\\geq 50$ years**\n- Risk in exposed ($R_{E2}$):\n$$\nR_{E2} = \\frac{120}{120 + 120} = \\frac{120}{240} = 0.5\n$$\n- Risk in unexposed ($R_{U2}$):\n$$\nR_{U2} = \\frac{160}{160 + 480} = \\frac{160}{640} = 0.25\n$$\n- Stratum-specific risk ratio ($RR_2$):\n$$\nRR_2 = \\frac{R_{E2}}{R_{U2}} = \\frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2.0\n$$\nThe stratum-specific risk ratios are identical ($RR_1 = RR_2 = 2.0$), indicating that the effect of the solvent on dermatitis risk is consistent across these two age groups (i.e., there is no effect modification by age).\n\n**2. Crude (Unstratified) Risk Ratio**\n\nTo calculate the crude risk ratio, we first collapse the stratified data into a single $2 \\times 2$ table.\n- Total exposed cases = $40 + 120 = 160$\n- Total exposed non-cases = $160 + 120 = 280$\n- Total exposed = $160 + 280 = 440$\n- Total unexposed cases = $30 + 160 = 190$\n- Total unexposed non-cases = $270 + 480 = 750$\n- Total unexposed = $190 + 750 = 940$\n\n- Crude risk in exposed ($R_{E,crude}$):\n$$\nR_{E,crude} = \\frac{160}{440} = \\frac{4}{11}\n$$\n- Crude risk in unexposed ($R_{U,crude}$):\n$$\nR_{U,crude} = \\frac{190}{940} = \\frac{19}{94}\n$$\n- Crude risk ratio ($RR_{crude}$):\n$$\nRR_{crude} = \\frac{R_{E,crude}}{R_{U,crude}} = \\frac{4/11}{19/94} = \\frac{4 \\times 94}{11 \\times 19} = \\frac{376}{209} \\approx 1.799\n$$\n\n**3. Mantel–Haenszel Pooled Risk Ratio ($RR_{MH}$)**\n\nThe Mantel-Haenszel method provides a pooled estimate of the risk ratio, adjusted for the stratification variable (age). It is a weighted average of the stratum-specific risk ratios. For a set of $k$ strata, the formula is:\n$$\nRR_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{a_i \\cdot n_{Ui}}{N_i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{b_i \\cdot n_{Ei}}{N_i}}\n$$\nwhere for stratum $i$:\n- $a_i$ = cases in exposed group\n- $b_i$ = cases in unexposed group\n- $n_{Ei}$ = total number in exposed group\n- $n_{Ui}$ = total number in unexposed group\n- $N_i$ = total number in the stratum ($n_{Ei} + n_{Ui}$)\n\nLet's apply this formula to our data.\n\n**For Stratum 1 (Age $ 50$ years):**\n$a_1 = 40$, $b_1 = 30$, $n_{E1} = 200$, $n_{U1} = 300$, $N_1 = 500$.\n- Numerator contribution: $\\frac{a_1 n_{U1}}{N_1} = \\frac{40 \\times 300}{500} = \\frac{12000}{500} = 24$\n- Denominator contribution: $\\frac{b_1 n_{E1}}{N_1} = \\frac{30 \\times 200}{500} = \\frac{6000}{500} = 12$\n\n**For Stratum 2 (Age $\\geq 50$ years):**\n$a_2 = 120$, $b_2 = 160$, $n_{E2} = 240$, $n_{U2} = 640$, $N_2 = 880$.\n- Numerator contribution: $\\frac{a_2 n_{U2}}{N_2} = \\frac{120 \\times 640}{880} = \\frac{76800}{880} = \\frac{960}{11}$\n- Denominator contribution: $\\frac{b_2 n_{E2}}{N_2} = \\frac{160 \\times 240}{880} = \\frac{38400}{880} = \\frac{480}{11}$\n\nNow, we sum the contributions to find $RR_{MH}$:\n$$\nRR_{MH} = \\frac{24 + \\frac{960}{11}}{12 + \\frac{480}{11}} = \\frac{\\frac{264 + 960}{11}}{\\frac{132 + 480}{11}} = \\frac{\\frac{1224}{11}}{\\frac{612}{11}} = \\frac{1224}{612} = 2.0\n$$\n\n**4. Comparison and Assessment of Confounding**\n\n- The crude risk ratio is $RR_{crude} \\approx 1.799$.\n- The adjusted risk ratio is $RR_{MH} = 2.0$.\n\nSince the crude estimate ($1.799$) is different from the age-adjusted estimate ($2.0$), there is evidence of confounding by age. Confounding occurs because age is associated with both the exposure (solvent) and the outcome (dermatitis).\n\n- **Association of Age with Outcome:** The baseline risk of dermatitis is higher in the older group ($R_{U2}=0.25$) than in the younger group ($R_{U1}=0.1$).\n- **Association of Age with Exposure:** The proportion of workers exposed to the solvent is lower in the older group ($\\frac{240}{880} \\approx 0.27$) than in the younger group ($\\frac{200}{500} = 0.4$).\n\nThe adjusted risk ratio ($2.0$) represents the true strength of the association between the solvent and dermatitis, which is uniform across age groups. The crude risk ratio ($1.799$) is an underestimate of this true association, biased towards the null value of $1.0$. This phenomenon is known as **negative confounding**. It occurred because the group with a higher baseline risk of dermatitis (older workers) was less likely to be exposed to the solvent, which diluted the observed association in the crude analysis.\n\nThe final requested value is the Mantel-Haenszel pooled risk ratio, rounded to four significant figures.\n$RR_{MH} = 2.0$.
