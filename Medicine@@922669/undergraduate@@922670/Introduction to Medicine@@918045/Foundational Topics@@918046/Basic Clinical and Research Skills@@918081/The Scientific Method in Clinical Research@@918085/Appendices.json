Exactly $50$ students have active infection at baseline. The remaining students are free of active infection at baseline.

The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds first by formally defining the requested epidemiological measures—point prevalence and cumulative incidence—in the specific context of the study, and then by calculating their values based on the provided data.\n\n**Formal Definitions**\n\nPoint Prevalence: In clinical research, point prevalence measures the proportion of a population that has a specific disease or condition at a single, specified point in time. For the described study, the point prevalence at baseline is formally defined as the number of students with a laboratory-confirmed active respiratory infection on day $0$, divided by the total number of students in the dormitory census on day $0$.\n\nCumulative Incidence: Cumulative incidence, also referred to as incidence proportion or risk, quantifies the proportion of an initially disease-free population (the population at risk) that develops a specific disease or condition over a specified period of observation. For this study, the $6$-month cumulative incidence is formally defined as the number of new laboratory-confirmed respiratory infections that occurred during the $6$-month follow-up period, divided by the number of students who were free of infection and therefore at risk at the beginning of the period (day $0$).\n\n**Calculations**\n\nLet $N$ represent the total population size of the student dormitory at baseline (day $0$), where $N=1000$.\nLet $C_{prev}$ represent the number of existing (prevalent) cases of active infection at baseline, where $C_{prev}=50$.\nLet $C_{inc}$ represent the number of new (incident) cases of infection that occurred during the $6$-month follow-up period, where $C_{inc}=220$.\n\n**1. Point Prevalence at Baseline**\n\nThe point prevalence, denoted as $P$, is calculated using its fundamental definition:\n$$P = \\frac{\\text{Number of existing cases at a point in time}}{\\text{Total population at that same point in time}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P = \\frac{C_{prev}}{N} = \\frac{50}{1000} = 0.05$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed to four significant figures. To express $0.05$ with four significant figures, we add trailing zeros, which are significant in this context.\n$$P = 0.05000$$\n\n**2. 6-Month Cumulative Incidence**\n\nThe cumulative incidence, denoted as $CI$, is calculated using its fundamental definition:\n$$CI = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases over a specified period}}{\\text{Number of individuals at risk at the start of the period}}$$\nFirst, we must determine the population at risk, $N_{risk}$, at baseline. This is the total population minus those who already have the infection, as they are not at risk of developing a *new* infection.\n$$N_{risk} = N - C_{prev} = 1000 - 50 = 950$$\nNow, we can calculate the $6$-month cumulative incidence using the number of new cases, $C_{inc} = 220$, that occurred within this at-risk population.\n$$CI = \\frac{C_{inc}}{N_{risk}} = \\frac{220}{950}$$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$CI = \\frac{22}{95} \\approx 0.231578947...$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures, we examine the fifth significant digit. Since the fifth digit ($7$) is $5$ or greater, we round up the fourth significant digit.\n$$CI \\approx 0.2316$$\n\nThe final answers for point prevalence and $6$-month cumulative incidence, respectively, are $0.05000$ and $0.2316$.

The Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is the gold standard for evaluating such interventions, but interpreting its results requires careful communication.

Number of events (strokes), $E_T = 48$.\n-   **Control Group (Standard Care):** Number of participants, $N_C = 1200$. Number of events (strokes), $E_C = 84$.\n-   **Follow-up Period:** $1$ year.\n-   **Provided Definitions:**\n    -   **Risk:** Proportion of individuals with the event in a group.\n    -   **Odds:** Ratio of the probability of the event to the probability of no event.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard, realistic clinical trial scenario. The provided data are complete, consistent, and sufficient for calculating the required metrics (absolute risk, risk difference, risk ratio, and odds ratio). The terminology and definitions are standard in epidemiology and clinical research. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or scientific flaws.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of Metrics\nBased on the givens and definitions, we can derive the required values.\n\n**1. Absolute Risk (AR)**\nThe absolute risk, or incidence proportion, is defined as the number of new cases (events) divided by the total number of individuals in the group at the start of the follow-up.\n\n-   **Absolute Risk in the Treatment Arm ($AR_T$):**\n    $$AR_T = \\frac{E_T}{N_T} = \\frac{48}{1200} = \\frac{4}{100} = 0.04$$\n    Expressed as a percentage, this is $0.04 \\times 100\\% = 4\\%$.\n\n-   **Absolute Risk in the Control Arm ($AR_C$):**\n    $$AR_C = \\frac{E_C}{N_C} = \\frac{84}{1200} = \\frac{7}{100} = 0.07$$\n    Expressed as a percentage, this is $0.07 \\times 100\\% = 7\\%$.\n\n**2. Risk Difference (RD)**\nThe problem asks for the risk difference, specified as \"treatment minus control\". This is also known as the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) when the value is positive, or simply the risk difference.\n$$RD = AR_T - AR_C = 0.04 - 0.07 = -0.03$$\nA negative value indicates a reduction in risk in the treatment group. The magnitude, $0.03$, corresponds to an absolute risk reduction of $3$ percentage points. This means for every $100$ people treated with the new drug for $1$ year, there are $3$ fewer strokes compared to standard care.\n\n**3. Risk Ratio (RR)**\nThe risk ratio is the ratio of the risk in the treatment arm to the risk in the control arm.\n$$RR = \\frac{AR_T}{AR_C} = \\frac{0.04}{0.07} = \\frac{4}{7} \\approx 0.5714$$\nThe relative risk reduction (RRR) is given by $1 - RR$.\n$$RRR = 1 - \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{3}{7} \\approx 0.4286$$\nThis means the new drug reduces the risk of stroke by approximately $42.9\\%$ (or about $43\\%$) relative to the risk with standard care.\n\n**4. Odds Ratio (OR)**\nThe odds of an event are the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring.\n-   **Number of non-events in the Treatment Arm:** $NonE_T = N_T - E_T = 1200 - 48 = 1152$.\n-   **Number of non-events in the Control Arm:** $NonE_C = N_C - E_C = 1200 - 84 = 1116$.\n\n-   **Odds in the Treatment Arm ($Odds_T$):**\n    $$Odds_T = \\frac{E_T}{NonE_T} = \\frac{48}{1152}$$\n\n-   **Odds in the Control Arm ($Odds_C$):**\n    $$Odds_C = \\frac{E_C}{NonE_C} = \\frac{84}{1116}$$\n\n-   The Odds Ratio is the ratio of these odds:\n    $$OR = \\frac{Odds_T}{Odds_C} = \\frac{48/1152}{84/1116} = \\frac{48 \\times 1116}{84 \\times 1152}$$\n    Simplifying the expression:\n    $$OR = \\frac{(4 \\times 12) \\times (93 \\times 12)}{(7 \\times 12) \\times (96 \\times 12)} = \\frac{4 \\times 93}{7 \\times 96} = \\frac{372}{672} = \\frac{31}{56} \\approx 0.5536$$\nThe reduction in odds is $1 - OR \\approx 1 - 0.5536 = 0.4464$, or about $45\\%$.\nAs expected for a low-probability event (risks of $4\\%$ and $7\\%$), the odds ratio ($OR \\approx 0.55$) is numerically close to, but slightly more extreme (further from $1$) than, the risk ratio ($RR \\approx 0.57$).\n\n### Step 4: Option-by-Option Analysis\nWe now evaluate each option against these correct derivations.\n\n**A. New drug absolute risk $= 48/1200 = 0.04 = 4\\%$; standard care absolute risk $= 84/1200 = 0.07 = 7\\%$; risk difference (treatment minus control) $= 0.04 - 0.07 = -0.03$, that is an absolute risk reduction of $3$ percentage points (about $3$ fewer strokes per $100$ treated over $1$ year); risk ratio $= 0.04/0.07 \\approx 0.57$, meaning the probability of stroke is about $43\\%$ lower with the new drug; odds ratio $= (48/1152)/(84/1116) \\approx 0.55$, meaning the odds of stroke are about $45\\%$ lower with the new drug, which is numerically close to the risk ratio here because the event is uncommon.**\n-   **AR Calculation:** Correct.\n-   **RD Calculation and Interpretation:** Correct.\n-   **RR Calculation and Interpretation:** Correct, including the correct calculation of relative risk reduction.\n-   **OR Calculation and Interpretation:** Correct, including the correct formula, calculation, and explanation for its proximity to the risk ratio.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option accurately presents all calculations and provides clinically sound and precise interpretations.\n\n**B. New drug absolute risk $= 4\\%$; standard care absolute risk $= 7\\%$; risk difference (treatment minus control) $= +3$ percentage points, indicating an absolute risk increase of $3\\%$; risk ratio $= 0.57$, indicating a $43$ percentage point reduction; odds ratio $= 0.57$, exactly equal to and interchangeable with the risk ratio in all cases.**\n-   **RD Calculation and Interpretation:** The sign is incorrect ($RD = -0.03$, not $+0.03$). Thus, it is a risk reduction, not an increase.\n-   **RR Interpretation:** The relative risk reduction is $43\\%$, not $43$ percentage points. This confuses relative and absolute measures.\n-   **OR Calculation and Interpretation:** The value is incorrect ($OR \\approx 0.55$, not $0.57$), and the statement that OR and RR are \"exactly equal and interchangeable in all cases\" is a significant conceptual error.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. New drug absolute risk $= 48/1152 \\approx 4.17\\%$; standard care absolute risk $= 84/1116 \\approx 7.53\\%$; risk difference $= 4.17\\% - 7.53\\% \\approx -3.36$ percentage points; risk ratio $= 4.17\\%/7.53\\% \\approx 0.55$; odds ratio $= 0.04/0.07 \\approx 0.57$. The denominators should exclude those with events so that the risk uses non-events.**\n-   **AR Calculation:** Fundamentally incorrect. The calculation shown, $E/(N-E)$, is the formula for odds, not risk. The definition of risk uses the total population $N$ as the denominator.\n-   **RR and OR Calculation:** Because it incorrectly calculates risk, it subsequently mislabels the odds ratio as the risk ratio and the risk ratio as the odds ratio.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. New drug absolute risk $= 4\\%$; standard care absolute risk $= 7\\%$; risk difference (treatment minus control) $= -3$ percentage points; risk ratio $= 7\\%/4\\% = 1.75$, indicating a $75\\%$ higher risk on the new drug; odds ratio $= (48/1200)/(84/1200) = 48/84 \\approx 0.57$.**\n-   **RR Calculation:** It calculates $AR_C/AR_T$ instead of $AR_T/AR_C$. The interpretation is also flawed; an RR of $1.75$ would imply a higher risk in the group represented by the numerator (standard care), not the new drug.\n-   **OR Calculation:** The formula presented, $(E_T/N_T)/(E_C/N_C)$, is the formula for the risk ratio, not the odds ratio.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. New drug absolute risk $= 4\\%$; standard care absolute risk $= 7\\%$; risk difference $= -0.03$, interpreted as $0.03$ fewer strokes per $1000$ treated; risk ratio $= 0.57$, interpreted as an exact $43\\%$ absolute reduction in risk; odds ratio $= (48 \\times 1116)/(84 \\times 1152) \\approx 0.55$, which means $45\\%$ fewer strokes per $100$ patients, not just fewer odds.**\n-   **RD Interpretation:** Incorrect. A difference of $0.03$ corresponds to $3$ fewer strokes per $100$ people, or $30$ per $1000$.\n-   **RR Interpretation:** Incorrect. The reduction is a *relative* reduction, not *absolute*. Also, it is an approximation ($4/7$), not \"exact\".\n-   **OR Interpretation:** Incorrect. The odds ratio describes the relative change in *odds*, not a direct change in the number of events per $100$ patients. Interpreting a $45\\%$ reduction in odds as a $45\\%$ reduction in strokes is a common but serious misinterpretation.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, option A is the only one that is entirely correct in its calculations and interpretations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4984045"}, {"introduction": "While RCTs provide the strongest evidence, they are not always feasible; much of clinical research relies on observational data.

A confounder is a pre-exposure common cause of $E$ and $Y$. A mediator lies on the causal pathway from $E$ to $Y$. A collider is a common effect of two variables; conditioning on it can induce bias. Here, $A$ and $L_0$ are confounders (they cause both $E$ and $Y$ and precede $E$), $L_1$ is a mediator ($E \\to L_1 \\to Y$), and $C$ is a collider on the path $E \\to C \\leftarrow U \\to Y$. To estimate the total effect, adjust for $A$ and $L_0$, do not adjust for $L_1$, and avoid conditioning on or restricting by $C$.\n\nB. A confounder is any variable associated with both $E$ and $Y$, regardless of timing; a mediator is any variable affected by $E$. Here, $L_1$ is a confounder because it is associated with both $E$ and $Y$, $A$ is a mediator because it influences $E$, and $C$ is a confounder because it is associated with $E$ and $Y$ via $U$. Therefore, adjust for $L_1$, $A$, and $C$.\n\nC. The safest strategy is to adjust for all measured variables to block every possible association.

To avoid bias introduced by incorrect adjustment, do not adjust for any variables. The effect of $E$ on $Y$ can be estimated from the crude association without conditioning.\n\nE.

The causal structure is fully specified by the given relationships, and the question is a direct application of causal inference principles to this structure.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. The analysis will proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe goal is to find an adjustment strategy to estimate the total causal effect of $E$ on $Y$. This requires identifying and blocking all non-causal \"backdoor\" paths between $E$ and $Y$, while leaving all causal \"frontdoor\" paths from $E$ to $Y$ open. The causal relationships can be represented by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):\n\n-   **Nodes**: $A, L_0, U, E, L_1, C, Y$\n-   **Edges**:\n    -   $A \\to E$, $A \\to Y$\n    -   $L_0 \\to E$, $L_0 \\to Y$\n    -   $U \\to E$, $U \\to Y$\n    -   $E \\to L_1 \\to Y$\n    -   $E \\to C$, $U \\to C$\n\nLet's analyze the paths between the exposure $E$ and the outcome $Y$.\n\n1.  **Causal (Frontdoor) Path**: This is a directed path from $E$ to $Y$. The problem specifies one such path: $E \\to L_1 \\to Y$. To estimate the *total* causal effect, we must not block this path. Blocking a causal path is achieved by conditioning on a variable on that path. Therefore, we must **not** adjust for the mediator $L_1$.\n\n2.  **Non-Causal (Backdoor) Paths**: These are paths between $E$ and $Y$ that start with an arrow pointing into $E$. A backdoor path creates a non-causal association (confounding) unless it is blocked.\n    -   **Path 1**: $E \\leftarrow A \\to Y$. Here, $A$ is a common cause of $E$ and $Y$. It is a pre-exposure variable. This path creates confounding. To block it, we must **adjust for $A$**. $A$ is a **confounder**.\n    -   **Path 2**: $E \\leftarrow L_0 \\to Y$. Similarly, $L_0$ is a common cause of $E$ and $Y$ and a pre-exposure variable. This path also creates confounding. To block it, we must **adjust for $L_0$**. $L_0$ is a **confounder**.\n    -   **Path 3**: $E \\leftarrow U \\to Y$. $U$ is also a pre-exposure common cause of $E$ and $Y$, and thus a confounder. To block this path, we must adjust for $U$. The problem states that $U$ is a recorded variable, so adjustment is possible. Note that even if $U$ were unmeasured, it would still be a confounder, leading to unobserved confounding.\n    -   **Path 4**: $E \\to C \\leftarrow U \\to Y$. In this path, the variable $C$ has two arrows pointing into it ($E \\to C$ and $U \\to C$). This makes $C$ a **collider** on this path. A path containing a collider is naturally blocked at the collider. No association flows through this path unless we condition on the collider $C$ or a descendant of $C$. Conditioning on $C$ (e.g., by restricting the analysis to subjects who attended follow-up, $C=1$) would *open* this path, inducing a non-causal association between $E$ and $Y$ via $U$. This phenomenon is known as collider-stratification bias. Therefore, we must **not** adjust for or stratify by $C$.\n\n**Summary of Analysis**:\n-   **Confounders**: $A$, $L_0$, and $U$ are confounders. They are pre-exposure common causes of $E$ and $Y$. To eliminate confounding, we must adjust for them.\n-   **Mediator**: $L_1$ is a mediator. It lies on the causal pathway from $E$ to $Y$. To estimate the total effect, we must not adjust for it.\n-   **Collider**: $C$ is a collider on the path $E \\to C \\leftarrow U \\to Y$. To avoid inducing bias, we must not adjust for it.\n\n**Recommended Adjustment Strategy**: Adjust for the set of confounders $\\{A, L_0, U\\}$. Do not adjust for the mediator $L_1$ or the collider $C$.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options based on this analysis.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. A confounder is a pre-exposure common cause of $E$ and $Y$. A mediator lies on the causal pathway from $E$ to $Y$. A collider is a common effect of two variables; conditioning on it can induce bias. Here, $A$ and $L_0$ are confounders (they cause both $E$ and $Y$ and precede $E$), $L_1$ is a mediator ($E \\to L_1 \\to Y$), and $C$ is a collider on the path $E \\to C \\leftarrow U \\to Y$. To estimate the total effect, adjust for $A$ and $L_0$, do not adjust for $L_1$, and avoid conditioning on or restricting by $C$.**\n\n-   **Definitions**: The definitions provided for confounder, mediator, and collider are accurate and standard.\n-   **Classification**: The classification of $A$ and $L_0$ as confounders, $L_1$ as a mediator, and $C$ as a collider on the specified path is entirely correct according to our DAG analysis.\n-   **Recommendation**: The recommendation to adjust for $A$ and $L_0$, not adjust for $L_1$, and not adjust for $C$ is perfectly consistent with the goal of estimating the total causal effect. While an ideal adjustment set would also include $U$, the advice regarding the variables mentioned ($A, L_0, L_1, C$) is flawless.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. A confounder is any variable associated with both $E$ and $Y$, regardless of timing; a mediator is any variable affected by $E$. Here, $L_1$ is a confounder because it is associated with both $E$ and $Y$, $A$ is a mediator because it influences $E$, and $C$ is a confounder because it is associated with $E$ and $Y$ via $U$. Therefore, adjust for $L_1$, $A$, and $C$.**\n\n-   **Definitions**: The provided definitions are dangerously imprecise and incorrect. A confounder must be a common cause, not just any associated variable. A mediator is not just any variable affected by $E$ (a collider like $C$ is also affected by $E$).\n-   **Classification**: The classifications are wrong. $L_1$ is a mediator, not a confounder. $A$ is a confounder, not a mediator (it precedes $E$). $C$ is a collider, not a confounder.\n-   **Recommendation**: The recommendation to adjust for $L_1$, $A$, and $C$ is incorrect. Adjusting for the mediator $L_1$ would estimate a direct effect, not the total effect. Adjusting for the collider $C$ would induce bias.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The safest strategy is to adjust for all measured variables to block every possible association. Here, adjust for $A$, $L_0$, $L_1$, and $C$; whether they are confounders, mediators, or colliders is secondary to removing associations.**\n\n-   **Strategy**: The premise that adjusting for all measured variables is \"safest\" is a fundamental fallacy in causal inference. Indiscriminate adjustment can introduce bias by conditioning on colliders or block the effect of interest by conditioning on mediators.\n-   **Recommendation**: Adjusting for $L_1$ is incorrect for estimating the total effect. Adjusting for $C$ is incorrect as it induces collider bias. The statement that the causal role of variables is \"secondary\" is the exact opposite of rigorous causal reasoning.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. To avoid bias introduced by incorrect adjustment, do not adjust for any variables. The effect of $E$ on $Y$ can be estimated from the crude association without conditioning.**\n\n-   **Strategy**: This advocates for avoiding adjustment altogether. In an observational study, the crude (unadjusted) association is almost always biased due to confounding.\n-   **Recommendation**: In this problem, we have explicitly defined backdoor paths ($E \\leftarrow A \\to Y$, $E \\leftarrow L_0 \\to Y$, $E \\leftarrow U \\to Y$) that cause confounding. Ignoring them by calculating a crude association would lead to a biased estimate of the effect of $E$ on $Y$. The correct approach is principled adjustment, not no adjustment.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. A collider is any variable downstream of $E$. Here, $C$ is downstream of $E$, so conditioning on $C=1$ (patients who attend follow-up) ensures complete data and reduces bias. Because $L_1$ explains how $E$ reduces $Y$, adjust for $L_1$ to isolate the biological mechanism; residual confounding by $A$ and $L_0$ is minor and can be ignored.**\n\n-   **Definitions/Classifications**: The definition of a collider as \"any variable downstream of $E$\" is incorrect. A mediator is also downstream.\n-   **Recommendation**: Conditioning on $C$ *induces* bias, it does not reduce it. The appeal to \"complete data\" is a common but dangerous justification for collider stratification. Adjusting for the mediator $L_1$ would not provide the *total* effect. The claim that confounding by $A$ and $L_0$ is \"minor\" is an unsubstantiated and highly implausible assertion in this clinical context. This option contains multiple severe errors in causal reasoning.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4984048"}]}
