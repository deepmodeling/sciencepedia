The foundational definitions needed are:\n\n1. The Defined Daily Dose (DDD) as per the World Health Organization (WHO) is the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults. For meropenem, the WHO DDD is $2\\,\\mathrm{g}$ per day. If a total of $G$ grams of meropenem is dispensed over the surveillance period, then the total number of DDDs consumed, denoted $D$, is computed by normalizing the dispensed amount to the WHO DDD:\n$$\nD \\equiv \\frac{G}{2\\,\\mathrm{g}}.\n$$\n\n2. A “patient-day” is the sum across days of the number of patients occupying beds. For an ICU with $B$ beds, observed over $T$ days, with mean occupancy fraction $o$ (where $0 \\leq o \\leq 1$), the total patient-days, denoted $PD$, is given by\n$$\nPD \\equiv B \\times T \\times o.\n$$\nThis follows from the definition that occupancy is the fraction of beds occupied on average, so $B \\times o$ is the average number of occupied beds per day, and multiplying by $T$ days yields the total patient-days.\n\n3. To compare consumption across units or time, a standardized rate is constructed as “DDD per $1000$ patient-days,” denoted $R$, by scaling the per-patient-day consumption by $1000$:\n$$\nR \\equiv \\left( \\frac{D}{PD} \\right) \\times 1000.\n$$\n\nWe now compute each quantity from the given data.\n\nFirst, compute the total grams of meropenem dispensed.

This is the central tenet of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) optimization.

The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) is the lowest antimicrobial concentration that prevents visible growth under standardized conditions. For time-dependent antibiotics like beta-lactams, the stewardship target is the fraction of the dosing interval during which the free (unbound) drug concentration exceeds the MIC, denoted as $fTMIC$. For concentration-dependent antibiotics like fluoroquinolones, the stewardship targets include the free-drug area under the concentration-time curve to MIC ratio over a $24$-hour period, denoted $fAUC/MIC$, and the maximum free-drug concentration to MIC ratio, denoted $C_{\\max}/MIC$.\n\nAssume first-order elimination and linear pharmacokinetics: concentrations scale linearly with dose, and the free-drug concentration-time profile after a bolus dose has the form $C(t) = C_{0} \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{el}} t)$ for $t \\geq 0$, where $C_{0}$ is the initial free concentration and $k_{\\mathrm{el}}$ is the elimination rate constant.

The scaling factor $k$ is applied to the dose, which, under the assumption of linear pharmacokinetics, results in a proportional scaling of the free-drug concentration-time profiles.\n\nLet the original concentration profiles be $C_T(t)$ and $C_C(t)$, and the new, scaled profiles be $C_{T,k}(t)$ and $C_{C,k}(t)$.

The relevant parameters are $\\tau_C = 24$ hours and $MIC_C = 0.5$ mg/L.\n\nWe must first calculate the $AUC$ for the scaled concentration profile $C_{C,k}(t)$ over the dosing interval $[0, 24]$.\n$AUC_{0-24} = \\int_{0}^{24} C_{C,k}(t) \\,dt = \\int_{0}^{24} 20k \\exp(-0.1 t) \\,dt$\n$AUC_{0-24} = 20k \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(-0.1 t)}{-0.1} \\right]_{0}^{24}$\n$AUC_{0-24} = -200k \\left[ \\exp(-0.1 \\times 24) - \\exp(-0.1 \\times 0) \\right]$\n$AUC_{0-24} = -200k \\left( \\exp(-2.4) - 1 \\right) = 200k \\left( 1 - \\exp(-2.4) \\right)$\n\nNow we apply the stewardship target:\n$\\frac{AUC_{0-24}}{MIC_C} \\geq 125$\n$\\frac{200k \\left( 1 - \\exp(-2.4) \\right)}{0.5} \\geq 125$\n$400k \\left( 1 - \\exp(-2.4) \\right) \\geq 125$\n$k \\geq \\frac{125}{400 \\left( 1 - \\exp(-2.4) \\right)} = \\frac{5}{16 \\left( 1 - \\exp(-2.4) \\right)}$\n\nThis gives us the second constraint, $k_2$:\n$k \\geq k_2 = \\frac{5}{16 \\left( 1 - \\exp(-2.4) \\right)}$\n\n3.  **Drug C: Concentration-dependent target ($C_{\\max}/MIC \\geq 10$)**\nThe second target for Drug C is that the ratio of the maximum free-drug concentration to the MIC ($C_{\\max}/MIC$) must be at least $10$.\nThe concentration function $C_{C,k}(t) = 20k \\exp(-0.1 t)$ is a monotonically decreasing function for $t \\geq 0$.

The standard metric for quantifying such interactions in a checkerboard assay is the Fractional Inhibitory Concentration (FIC) index.\n\nFirst, we define the relevant quantities based on the problem statement. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) is the lowest concentration of a drug that prevents visible growth of a microorganism.\nLet $\\text{MIC}_A$ be the MIC of Drug A alone and $\\text{MIC}_B$ be the MIC of Drug B alone.
