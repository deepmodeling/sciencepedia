The virus is enveloped.\n2.  The virion morphology is large and brick-shaped.\n3.  The genome is composed of double-stranded Deoxyribonucleic Acid ($DNA$).\n4.  All genome replication and transcription occur in the cytoplasm.\n5.  The virion packages a polymerase that synthesizes Ribonucleic Acid ($RNA$) from a $DNA$ template.\n6.  The classification must be based on the Central Dogma and the Baltimore scheme.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is assessed for validity based on scientific principles and logical consistency.\n\n*   **Scientific Groundedness:** The problem describes a virus with a double-stranded $DNA$ (ds$DNA$) genome that replicates exclusively in the cytoplasm and packages its own $DNA$-dependent $RNA$ polymerase. This is a scientifically accurate and well-documented replication strategy, exemplified by the Poxviridae family (e.g., variola virus, vaccinia virus). The reference to the Central Dogma and the Baltimore classification scheme anchors the problem in foundational virological principles.\n*   **Well-Posedness:** The provided characteristics are sufficient and consistent for classifying the virus using the Baltimore scheme. The question is specific, asking for the single best group and its justification. A unique, meaningful solution can be derived from the given data.\n*   **Objectivity:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective elements.\n\nThe problem statement does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. The data points are mutually consistent; specifically, the cytoplasmic replication of a $DNA$ virus necessitates the packaging of a viral transcriptase, as the host's enzymes are sequestered in the nucleus.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will now be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe Baltimore classification system categorizes viruses into seven groups based on their genome composition and their pathway to synthesize messenger $RNA$ ($mRNA$). The core task is to map the given viral characteristics to the appropriate Baltimore group.\n\n1.  **Genome Type:** The problem explicitly states the virus has a \"genome composed of double-stranded Deoxyribonucleic Acid ($DNA$)\". In the Baltimore scheme, viruses with ds$DNA$ genomes belong to either Group $I$ (ds$DNA$ viruses) or Group $VII$ (ds$DNA$ reverse-transcribing viruses).\n\n2.  **Replication Strategy and Packaged Enzyme:** The problem provides two crucial details that distinguish between Group $I$ and Group $VII$:\n    *   \"All genome replication and transcription occur in the cytoplasm.\"\n    *   \"Virions carry a polymerase that synthesizes Ribonucleic Acid ($RNA$) from a $DNA$ template.\" This enzyme is, by definition, a $DNA$-dependent $RNA$ polymerase (DdRP).\n\n3.  **Distinguishing Group $I$ from Group $VII$:**\n    *   **Group $I$ viruses** use their ds$DNA$ genome as a direct template for transcription to produce $mRNA$. The reaction is $dsDNA \\rightarrow mRNA$, catalyzed by a DdRP. Most Group $I$ viruses (e.g., Herpesviruses, Adenoviruses) replicate in the nucleus and utilize the host cell's DdRP. However, those that replicate in the cytoplasm (e.g., Poxviruses) cannot access the host's nuclear machinery. Consequently, they must encode and package their own DdRP to initiate transcription upon entering the cytoplasm. The virus described fits this cytoplasmic-replicating subset of Group $I$.\n    *   **Group $VII$ viruses** (e.g., Hepadnaviruses) also have ds$DNA$ genomes but replicate via an $RNA$ intermediate. Their virions contain a reverse transcriptase ($RNA$-dependent $DNA$ polymerase), not a DdRP. The packaged enzyme is used to synthesize genomic $DNA$ from a pre-genomic $RNA$ transcript during virion maturation. The virus in the problem packages a DdRP, which synthesizes $RNA$ from $DNA$, ruling out Group $VII$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the ds$DNA$ genome and the packaged $DNA$-dependent $RNA$ polymerase, the virus must belong to Baltimore Group $I$. The justification for the packaged enzyme is its cytoplasmic replication site, which denies it access to the host's nuclear transcription enzymes.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Baltimore Group $I$ (double-stranded Deoxyribonucleic Acid), because cytoplasmic replication mandates a virion-packaged DNA-dependent RNA polymerase to transcribe early mRNA without access to nuclear host enzymes.**\n    *   This option correctly identifies the virus as belonging to Group $I$ based on its ds$DNA$ genome. The justification is also perfectly correct: the cytoplasmic site of replication logically necessitates a packaged DdRP to overcome the spatial separation from the host's nuclear polymerases. This aligns completely with our derivation.\n    *   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Baltimore Group $VII$ (double-stranded Deoxyribonucleic Acid reverse-transcribing), because a DNA genome coupled with cytoplasmic replication implies an RNA intermediate and a packaged reverse transcriptase for transcription.**\n    *   This option incorrectly assigns the virus to Group $VII$. The packaged enzyme is a DdRP, not a reverse transcriptase. The justification makes an invalid inference; cytoplasmic replication of a $DNA$ virus does not imply a reverse transcription step.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Baltimore Group $V$ (negative-sense single-stranded Ribonucleic Acid), because virion-associated RNA polymerase is a hallmark of genomes that cannot be directly translated and therefore must carry an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.**\n    *   This option incorrectly identifies the genome type. The virus has a ds$DNA$ genome, not a negative-sense single-stranded $RNA$ ((-)ss$RNA$) genome. While the reasoning provided is a valid principle for Group $V$ viruses, it is misapplied here, as the virus in question has a different genome and a different type of polymerase ($DNA$-dependent, not $RNA$-dependent).\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Baltimore Group $VI$ (positive-sense single-stranded Ribonucleic Acid reverse-transcribing), because cytoplasmic replication and a virion polymerase are typical of retroviruses that generate DNA from RNA.**\n    *   This option incorrectly identifies the virus as a retrovirus (Group $VI$). The genome is ds$DNA$, not positive-sense single-stranded $RNA$ ((+)ss$RNA$). Retroviruses package reverse transcriptase to perform $RNA \\rightarrow DNA$ synthesis, which is the opposite of the function of the enzyme described in the problem.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Baltimore Group $IV$ (positive-sense single-stranded Ribonucleic Acid), because cytoplasmic replication suggests a messenger Ribonucleic Acid-like genome that does not require a polymerase in the virion.**\n    *   This option incorrectly identifies the genome type as (+)ss$RNA$. Furthermore, its justification directly contradicts a key piece of data: the problem explicitly states that the virion *does* carry a polymerase.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4951850"}, {"introduction": "Many pathogenic bacteria cause disease by deploying powerful protein toxins. The Active-Binding (AB) toxins are a classic example, functioning like molecular machines that first target a host cell and then deliver an enzymatic 'warhead' to disrupt a vital process. This practice invites you to deconstruct the mechanism of diphtheria toxin, a prototypic AB toxin, and predict its devastating effect on host protein synthesis based on a series of experimental clues. [@problem_id:4951944]", "problem": "A researcher is teaching a seminar on Active–Binding (AB) toxins and wants students to reason mechanistically from core molecular biology to predict how such toxins disrupt host cells. The class considers diphtheria toxin from Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a Gram-positive pathogen. As a starting point, assume the following foundational facts: (i) the Central Dogma of molecular biology describes information flow from DNA to RNA to protein; (ii) ribosomal protein synthesis proceeds through initiation, elongation, and termination; (iii) during elongation on eukaryotic ribosomes, Elongation Factor $2$ (EF-$2$) hydrolyzes guanosine triphosphate to catalyze the translocation of peptidyl–transfer ribosomal complexes along messenger RNA; and (iv) covalent modification of a key translation factor can inactivate that factor, halting the process that requires it.\n\nYou plan a pulse-labeling experiment in cultured human epithelial cells, measuring incorporation of $\\;^{35}\\text{S}$-methionine into nascent polypeptides over $30$ minutes before and after adding picomolar ($10^{-12}\\ \\text{M}$) diphtheria toxin. You also test the effects of a vacuolar proton pump inhibitor (bafilomycin) and of microinjecting the catalytic fragment of the toxin directly into the cytosol. Your goal is to select the single mechanistic explanation that best integrates the AB architecture with the predicted consequence for host protein synthesis and the qualitative outcomes of these interventions.\n\nWhich option best explains the mechanism of AB toxins using diphtheria toxin as the example and correctly derives the expected effect on host protein synthesis in this setup?\n\nA. The Binding subunit engages the heparin-binding epidermal growth factor–like precursor (HB-EGF) receptor on the host surface, triggering receptor-mediated endocytosis. Acidification of the endosomal lumen enables translocation of the Active subunit into the cytosol. The Active subunit is an adenosine diphosphate–ribosyltransferase that uses Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD$^+$) to modify a diphthamide residue on EF-$2$, inactivating translocation during elongation. As a result, even picomolar toxin rapidly reduces $\\;^{35}\\text{S}$-methionine incorporation toward baseline within $30$ minutes; this is prevented by bafilomycin but restored if the Active subunit is delivered directly to the cytosol.\n\nB.

Translation is not directly affected; therefore, $\\;^{35}\\text{S}$-methionine incorporation remains unchanged at picomolar doses, regardless of endosomal $pH$.\n\nC. The toxin cleaves eukaryotic initiation factor $4$G (eIF-$4$G) to block initiation. Acidification is not required because the heavy chain translocates through the plasma membrane directly, and nuclear localization of the Active subunit halts transcription, explaining the drop in $\\;^{35}\\text{S}$-methionine incorporation.\n\nD. The toxin is primarily a pore-forming cytolysin: it inserts into the plasma membrane to leak amino acids out of the cytosol, passively starving ribosomes. This reduces $\\;^{35}\\text{S}$-methionine incorporation but can be rescued by supplying excess extracellular amino acids; the mechanism is independent of NAD$^+$ and endosomal $pH$.\n\nE. The Binding and Active subunits function as in option A, except the Active subunit acts stoichiometrically, inactivating only a single EF-$2$ molecule per toxin molecule. Therefore, a measurable reduction in $\\;^{35}\\text{S}$-methionine incorporation requires nanomolar concentrations, and bafilomycin does not alter the effect once binding has occurred.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically sound and well-posed, providing sufficient foundational information and experimental context to deduce the mechanism of action for diphtheria toxin and evaluate the provided options.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in integrating several facts:\n1.  Diphtheria toxin is an Active-Binding (AB) toxin. This architecture implies two functional components: a Binding (B) subunit that mediates attachment to a host cell and an Active (A) subunit that possesses enzymatic activity and is delivered into the host cell interior.\n2.  The target process is protein synthesis, specifically the elongation stage. The problem explicitly states that eukaryotic Elongation Factor $2$ ($EF-2$) is essential for the translocation step of elongation.\n3.  The mechanism of action involves covalent modification, which inactivates the target factor.\n4.  The experimental context involves several key interventions: a vacuolar proton pump inhibitor (bafilomycin), direct microinjection of the catalytic fragment, and the use of picomolar concentrations ($10^{-12}\\ \\text{M}$) of the toxin.\n\nFrom these premises, a coherent mechanism can be derived. The B subunit must bind a specific receptor on the surface of the human epithelial cell, leading to the uptake of the toxin, typically via receptor-mediated endocytosis into an endosome. For the A subunit to access its cytosolic target ($EF-2$), it must cross the endosomal membrane. The use of bafilomycin, which prevents the acidification of endosomes by inhibiting V-type ATPases, strongly implies that a low $pH$ environment within the endosome is a critical trigger for the translocation of the A subunit into the cytosol.\n\nOnce in the cytosol, the A subunit acts as an enzyme. The problem states that covalent modification inactivates a key translation factor. The A subunit of diphtheria toxin is a well-characterized adenosine diphosphate–ribosyltransferase. It uses nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ($NAD^{+}$) as a substrate to transfer an ADP-ribose moiety onto a unique, post-translationally modified histidine residue called diphthamide, which is found only on $EF-2$. This ADP-ribosylation of $EF-2$ renders it inactive.\n\nThe consequence of inactivating $EF-2$ is the cessation of the elongation phase of protein synthesis. Ribosomes stall on messenger RNA ($mRNA$) molecules, unable to translocate to the next codon. This leads to a rapid and near-complete shutdown of cellular protein synthesis.\n\nThe enzymatic nature of the A subunit is crucial. A single A subunit molecule can catalytically inactivate thousands of $EF-2$ molecules. This enzymatic amplification explains the extreme potency of the toxin, allowing it to be effective at the picomolar concentrations ($10^{-12}\\ \\text{M}$) specified in the problem.\n\nBased on this derived mechanism, the experimental outcomes can be predicted:\n- **Toxin Addition**: The pulse-labeling experiment measuring the incorporation of $\\;^{35}\\text{S}$-methionine will show a rapid and profound decrease, as new polypeptide synthesis is halted.\n- **Bafilomycin**: This agent will prevent endosomal acidification, thereby blocking the translocation of the A subunit into the cytosol. The toxin will be trapped in endosomes and will not affect protein synthesis. Thus, $\\;^{35}\\text{S}$-methionine incorporation will remain high.\n- **Microinjection**: Directly introducing the A subunit into the cytosol bypasses the entire entry pathway (binding, endocytosis, and translocation). The A subunit will have immediate access to its substrate ($EF-2$ and $NAD^{+}$), leading to a rapid shutdown of protein synthesis, an effect that would not be prevented by bafilomycin.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option against this derived framework.\n\n**A. The Binding subunit engages the heparin-binding epidermal growth factor–like precursor (HB-EGF) receptor on the host surface, triggering receptor-mediated endocytosis. Acidification of the endosomal lumen enables translocation of the Active subunit into the cytosol. The Active subunit is an adenosine diphosphate–ribosyltransferase that uses Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD$^+$) to modify a diphthamide residue on EF-$2$, inactivating translocation during elongation. As a result, even picomolar toxin rapidly reduces $\\;^{35}\\text{S}$-methionine incorporation toward baseline within $30$ minutes; this is prevented by bafilomycin but restored if the Active subunit is delivered directly to the cytosol.**\n\nThis option provides a description that is entirely consistent with our derived mechanism and the known biological facts. It correctly identifies the receptor ($HB-EGF$), the entry mechanism (endocytosis), the requirement for endosomal acidification, the enzymatic activity of the A subunit (ADP-ribosyltransferase using $NAD^{+}$), the specific target and modification ($EF-2$ on a diphthamide residue), and the functional consequence (inhibition of elongation). Furthermore, it correctly predicts the experimental outcomes regarding potency (effective at picomolar concentration) and the effects of bafilomycin and direct cytosolic delivery.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The Binding subunit targets ganglioside GM$1$, and the Active subunit adenosine diphosphate–ribosylates the stimulatory heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit, increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate and driving chloride secretion. Translation is not directly affected; therefore, $\\;^{35}\\text{S}$-methionine incorporation remains unchanged at picomolar doses, regardless of endosomal $pH$.**\n\nThis option incorrectly describes the mechanism of cholera toxin, not diphtheria toxin. Cholera toxin binds to the ganglioside $GM_1$ receptor and its A subunit ADP-ribosylates the $G_{s\\alpha}$ protein, leading to constitutive activation of adenylyl cyclase and a massive increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate ($cAMP$). This is factually incorrect for diphtheria toxin, whose primary target is $EF-2$ and whose effect is the inhibition of protein synthesis.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The toxin cleaves eukaryotic initiation factor $4$G (eIF-$4$G) to block initiation. Acidification is not required because the heavy chain translocates through the plasma membrane directly, and nuclear localization of the Active subunit halts transcription, explaining the drop in $\\;^{35}\\text{S}$-methionine incorporation.**\n\nThis option contains multiple errors. Diphtheria toxin is an ADP-ribosyltransferase, not a protease. The target is $EF-2$ (involved in elongation), not eukaryotic initiation factor $4$G ($eIF-4G$, involved in initiation). The toxin does require endosomal acidification for translocation; it does not cross the plasma membrane directly. The A subunit acts in the cytosol, not the nucleus, and it inhibits translation, not transcription.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The toxin is primarily a pore-forming cytolysin: it inserts into the plasma membrane to leak amino acids out of the cytosol, passively starving ribosomes. This reduces $\\;^{35}\\text{S}$-methionine incorporation but can be rescued by supplying excess extracellular amino acids; the mechanism is independent of NAD$^+$ and endosomal $pH$.**\n\nThis describes a mechanism fundamentally different from that of an AB-type enzymatic toxin. While the B subunit of diphtheria toxin does form a translocation pore in the endosomal membrane, the toxin's primary function is not to form lytic pores in the plasma membrane. This proposed mechanism fails to account for the enzymatic nature, the extreme potency at picomolar concentrations, the specific targeting of elongation, and the roles of $NAD^{+}$ and endosomal $pH$.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The Binding and Active subunits function as in option A, except the Active subunit acts stoichiometrically, inactivating only a single EF-$2$ molecule per toxin molecule. Therefore, a measurable reduction in $\\;^{35}\\text{S}$-methionine incorporation requires nanomolar concentrations, and bafilomycin does not alter the effect once binding has occurred.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies the basic pathway but makes two critical errors. First, it incorrectly claims the A subunit acts stoichiometrically. The A subunit is an enzyme, and its catalytic nature is the basis for the toxin's high potency. A stoichiometric mechanism would require much higher concentrations (likely in the nanomolar, $10^{-9}\\ \\text{M}$, to micromolar, $10^{-6}\\ \\text{M}$, range) to significantly deplete the cellular pool of $EF-2$. Second, it incorrectly claims that bafilomycin has no effect. Bafilomycin's inhibition of endosomal acidification is precisely what prevents the active subunit from ever reaching the cytosol to exert its effect.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4951944"}, {"introduction": "For an antibiotic to work, it must first reach its target inside the bacterial cell.

The fixed, negatively charged constriction zone of porins creates an electrostatic filter that disfavors anions and favors cations or zwitterions, while the finite pore diameter excludes bulky solutes; thus, small zwitterionic Drug M diffuses through both porins, whereas larger dianionic Drug N is admitted by the wider porin of Isolate X but excluded by the narrower, more anion-selective porin of Isolate Y.\n\nB. Porins recognize antibiotics via specific binding sites and use Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis to actively import them, so only drugs with the correct side chains are transported across the outer membrane.\n\nC. The thick peptidoglycan layer of Gram-negative bacteria functions as a sieving matrix that blocks all antibiotics above a molecular weight cutoff regardless of charge; outer membrane porins play no role in determining susceptibility.\n\nD. Porins are periplasmic enzymes that degrade antibiotics as they pass, so susceptibility depends on intrinsic catalytic rates within the porin lumen rather than on physical diffusion constraints.\n\nE.

Since $\\mathrm{p}H (7.4) > \\mathrm{p}K_a (4.0)$, this group is deprotonated, carrying a charge of $-1$.\n    - Amine group: $\\mathrm{p}K_a \\approx 9.0$. Since $\\mathrm{p}H (7.4) < \\mathrm{p}K_a (9.0)$, this group is protonated, carrying a charge of $+1$.\n    - **Conclusion**: At $\\mathrm{p}H$ $7.4$, Drug M is predominantly a **zwitterion**, with a net electrical charge of approximately $0$ ($(-1) + (+1) = 0$).\n\n- **Drug N**:\n    - First carboxylate group: $\\mathrm{p}K_a \\approx 2.5$.

This implies the wider pore of Isolate X is large enough to permit diffusion of the larger Drug N, and its negative charge is not strong enough to completely repel the dianionic Drug N.\n- **Isolate Y (Narrower Porin)**: Susceptible to Drug M but resistant to Drug N. This is the crucial finding.\n\n**3. Synthesize the Explanation**\n\nThe resistance of Isolate Y to Drug N must arise from the differences between Porin Y and Porin X, and the differences between Drug N and Drug M.\n\n- **Effect on Drug M**: Drug M is small and zwitterionic. Its small size allows it to pass through both the wider Porin X and the narrower Porin Y. Its net-neutral charge allows it to pass through the negatively charged constriction zones of both porins without significant electrostatic repulsion. This explains why both Isolate X and Isolate Y are susceptible to Drug M.\n\n- **Effect on Drug N**: Drug N is both larger and strongly anionic.\n    - **In Isolate X**: The \"relatively wide\" porin is large enough to accommodate the $0.70\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ radius of Drug N, and its moderate negative charge presents a surmountable barrier. Diffusion is sufficient for the drug to reach its target and kill the cell.\n    - **In Isolate Y**: Two factors contribute to the exclusion of Drug N.\n        1.  **Size Exclusion (Steric Hindrance)**: The \"narrower\" pore of Porin Y may be too small to allow effective passage of the larger Drug N.\n        2.  **Charge Exclusion (Electrostatic Repulsion)**: The \"more strongly negative\" constriction zone of Porin Y will create a powerful repulsive force against the dianionic (charge $-2$) Drug N, further impeding its entry.\n    \nThe combination of size and charge exclusion by the narrower, more electronegative Porin Y prevents Drug N from accumulating in the periplasm of Isolate Y at a high enough concentration to be effective, resulting in resistance.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **A. The fixed, negatively charged constriction zone of porins creates an electrostatic filter that disfavors anions and favors cations or zwitterions, while the finite pore diameter excludes bulky solutes; thus, small zwitterionic Drug M diffuses through both porins, whereas larger dianionic Drug N is admitted by the wider porin of Isolate X but excluded by the narrower, more anion-selective porin of Isolate Y.**\nThis statement accurately combines all the deduced elements. It correctly identifies the ionization states of the drugs (zwitterionic Drug M, dianionic Drug N is implied by \"anion-selective\"). It correctly describes the dual role of porins as both size and charge filters. It correctly attributes the resistance of Isolate Y to Drug N to the combination of the porin being \"narrower\" (size) and \"more anion-selective\" (charge). This explanation perfectly fits all the data provided.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n- **B. Porins recognize antibiotics via specific binding sites and use Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis to actively import them, so only drugs with the correct side chains are transported across the outer membrane.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The problem explicitly defines porins as channels for **passive diffusion**, which does not involve specific binding sites or energy from ATP hydrolysis. This describes active transport, a different mechanism.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n- **C. The thick peptidoglycan layer of Gram-negative bacteria functions as a sieving matrix that blocks all antibiotics above a molecular weight cutoff regardless of charge; outer membrane porins play no role in determining susceptibility.**\nThis statement is incorrect for three reasons. First, Gram-negative bacteria have a *thin* peptidoglycan layer. Second, the primary permeability barrier in Gram-negative bacteria is the outer membrane, not the peptidoglycan. Third, it claims porins play no role, which directly contradicts the experimental setup where the only difference between the susceptible and resistant isolates is their porin.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n- **D. Porins are periplasmic enzymes that degrade antibiotics as they pass, so susceptibility depends on intrinsic catalytic rates within the porin lumen rather than on physical diffusion constraints.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Porins are channel-forming proteins, not enzymes. Their function is transport, not catalysis. The problem also specifies that beta-lactamase (the relevant degrading enzyme for beta-lactams) activity is absent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n- **E. Lipid A in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) governs entry by hydrophobic partitioning, so hydrophilic beta-lactams cross the outer membrane independently of porins, and their susceptibility is unaffected by pore size or charge.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It correctly identifies Lipid A as part of LPS but misstates the transport mechanism for the drugs in question. The antibiotics are **hydrophilic**, meaning they cannot readily cross the hydrophobic lipid bilayer via partitioning. They require the water-filled porin channels. The statement that susceptibility is unaffected by pore size or charge is directly falsified by the experimental results.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4951903"}]}
