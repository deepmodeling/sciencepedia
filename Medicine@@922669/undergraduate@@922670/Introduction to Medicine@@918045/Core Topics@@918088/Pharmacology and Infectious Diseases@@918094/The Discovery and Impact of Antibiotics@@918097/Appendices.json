Consider a simplified, steady-state, spherically symmetric model of a penicillin-producing colony embedded in a homogeneous agar medium, intended to capture the essential physics and biology that set the size of the inhibition zone. A spherical colony of radius $a$ secretes penicillin at a uniform outward flux $q$ (amount per unit area per unit time) across its surface into the agar, where penicillin diffuses with diffusivity $D$. Assume that in the agar there is no bulk convection, no binding to the matrix, and no chemical decay of penicillin; further assume that susceptible bacteria are initially present everywhere outside the colony, but they do not consume penicillin in the region where they are inhibited and thus do not alter its distribution. In the absence of antibiotic, the bacteria would grow exponentially at per-capita rate $r$. Near the threshold of inhibition, model the antibiotic effect as a local per-capita kill rate proportional to the antibiotic concentration $C$, with proportionality coefficient $\\beta$ (so that the local net per-capita bacterial growth rate is $r - \\beta C$). Define the inhibition zone as the region where the net per-capita growth rate is nonpositive, and define the inhibition radius $R^{\\star}$ implicitly by the threshold condition $r = \\beta C(R^{\\star})$.

The reaction-diffusion model, though simplified, is a standard approach in mathematical biology to describe such phenomena. The assumptions (steady state, spherical symmetry, no decay) are common idealizations used to make the problem analytically tractable. Therefore, the problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a governing partial differential equation (the diffusion equation), which simplifies to an ordinary differential equation under the given symmetries.

I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Derivation\nThe problem asks for the steady-state concentration profile of penicillin, $C(r)$, in the agar medium for $r \\ge a$. The transport is governed by diffusion. Since there is no consumption or decay of penicillin in the medium, the governing equation is the steady-state diffusion equation, which in the absence of sources or sinks in the volume of the medium is $D \\nabla^2 C = 0$.\n\nGiven the spherical symmetry of the problem, the concentration $C$ is a function of the radial coordinate $r$ only. The Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2$ in spherical coordinates simplifies to:\n$$ \\nabla^2 C(r) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right) $$\nThus, the governing differential equation for $r > a$ is:\n$$ D \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right) = 0 $$\nSince the diffusivity $D$ is a non-zero constant, we can divide by it:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right) = 0 $$\nIntegrating this equation once with respect to $r$ yields:\n$$ r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} = K_1 $$\nwhere $K_1$ is a constant of integration. Rearranging for $\\frac{dC}{dr}$:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dr} = \\frac{K_1}{r^2} $$\nIntegrating a second time with respect to $r$ gives the general solution for the concentration profile:\n$$ C(r) = \\int \\frac{K_1}{r^2} dr = -\\frac{K_1}{r} + K_2 $$\nwhere $K_2$ is a second constant of integration.\n\nTo determine the constants $K_1$ and $K_2$, we must apply the boundary conditions provided in the problem.\n\n**Boundary Condition 1: Flux at the colony surface ($r=a$)**\nThe problem states that there is a uniform outward flux $q$ at the surface of the colony. The diffusive flux, $\\vec{J}$, is given by Fick's first law: $\\vec{J} = -D \\nabla C$. In spherical coordinates, the radial component of the flux is $J_r = -D \\frac{dC}{dr}$.\nAt $r=a$, the radial flux is given as $q$. Therefore:\n$$ J_r(a) = q = -D \\left. \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right|_{r=a} $$\nSubstituting our expression for $\\frac{dC}{dr}$:\n$$ q = -D \\left( \\frac{K_1}{a^2} \\right) $$\nSolving for $K_1$:\n$$ K_1 = -\\frac{q a^2}{D} $$\n\n**Boundary Condition 2: Concentration at infinity ($r \\to \\infty$)**\nThe agar medium extends to infinity, and the only source of penicillin is the finite-sized colony. It is physically necessary that the concentration of penicillin due to the colony should vanish at an infinite distance from the source.\n$$ \\lim_{r \\to \\infty} C(r) = 0 $$\nApplying this condition to our general solution:\n$$ \\lim_{r \\to \\infty} \\left( -\\frac{K_1}{r} + K_2 \\right) = 0 + K_2 = K_2 $$\nThus, we find that $K_2 = 0$.\n\nNow we can substitute the determined values of $K_1$ and $K_2$ back into the general solution to obtain the specific concentration profile for $r \\ge a$:\n$$ C(r) = -\\frac{\\left(-\\frac{q a^2}{D}\\right)}{r} + 0 $$\n$$ C(r) = \\frac{q a^2}{D r} $$\n\nThe final step is to determine the inhibition-zone diameter, $d$. The inhibition radius, $R^{\\star}$, is defined by the condition where the net bacterial growth rate is zero:\n$$ r - \\beta C(R^{\\star}) = 0 \\implies r = \\beta C(R^{\\star}) $$\nSubstituting our expression for $C(r)$:\n$$ r = \\beta \\left( \\frac{q a^2}{D R^{\\star}} \\right) $$\nWe can now solve this algebraic equation for $R^{\\star}$:\n$$ R^{\\star} = \\frac{\\beta q a^2}{D r} $$\nThe problem asks for the inhibition-zone diameter, $d$, which is twice the inhibition radius:\n$$ d = 2 R^{\\star} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $R^{\\star}$:\n$$ d = 2 \\left( \\frac{\\beta q a^2}{D r} \\right) $$\n$$ d = \\frac{2 \\beta q a^2}{D r} $$\nThis expression gives the diameter of the inhibition zone in terms of the specified parameters.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2 \\beta q a^{2}}{D r}}$$", "id": "4982103"}, {"introduction": "The effectiveness of antibiotics is constantly challenged by the evolution of resistant bacterial strains.

The net growth rate is defined as the difference between the per-capita birth rate, $b_i$, and the per-capita death rate, $d_i$:\n$$g_i = b_i - d_i$$\n\nThe selection coefficient, $s$, is a measure of the relative fitness difference. In the context of competing populations, it is standard to define this based on the rate of change of the ratio of their abundances. Let us define the ratio of the resistant subpopulation abundance to the susceptible subpopulation abundance as $z(t)$:\n$$z(t) = \\frac{N_R(t)}{N_S(t)}$$\nIf the resistant subpopulation has a growth advantage, this ratio will increase over time.

Therefore, we can substitute $z(t)$ back into the equation:\n$$\\frac{dz(t)}{dt} = (g_R - g_S) z(t)$$\nThis equation shows that the rate of change of the ratio $z(t)$ is directly proportional to the ratio itself, with the constant of proportionality being the difference in the net growth rates.\n\nFinally, we use our formal definition of the selection coefficient, $s$:\n$$s = \\frac{1}{z(t)}\\frac{dz(t)}{dt}$$\nSubstituting the expression we just derived for $\\frac{dz(t)}{dt}$:\n$$s = \\frac{1}{z(t)} \\left[ (g_R - g_S) z(t) \\right]$$\nThe term $z(t)$ cancels, yielding the relationship between the selection coefficient and the net growth rates:\n$$s = g_R - g_S$$\nThis derivation shows that for populations undergoing exponential growth, the selection coefficient is precisely the difference between their net per-capita growth rates.\n\nThe problem provides the following specific rates under antibiotic pressure:\n$b_R = 0.90\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$ (Resistant birth rate)\n$d_R = 0.60\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$ (Resistant death rate)\n$b_S = 0.85\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$ (Susceptible birth rate)\n$d_S = 1.05\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$ (Susceptible death rate)\n\nFirst, we calculate the net per-capita growth rates for each subpopulation.\nFor the resistant subpopulation, $R$:\n$$g_R = b_R - d_R = 0.90\\,\\text{h}^{-1} - 0.60\\,\\text{h}^{-1} = 0.30\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$$\nFor the susceptible subpopulation, $S$:\n$$g_S = b_S - d_S = 0.85\\,\\text{h}^{-1} - 1.05\\,\\text{h}^{-1} = -0.20\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$$\nA negative net growth rate for the susceptible population is expected in the presence of an effective antibiotic.\n\nNow, we compute the selection coefficient $s$ using the derived formula:\n$$s = g_R - g_S = (0.30\\,\\text{h}^{-1}) - (-0.20\\,\\text{h}^{-1})$$\n$$s = 0.30\\,\\text{h}^{-1} + 0.20\\,\\text{h}^{-1} = 0.50\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed to four significant figures if rounding is needed.
