It provides a standard task in biostatistics and epidemiology that can be solved using fundamental principles of probability theory.\n\nLet's define the following events:\n- $D$: The event that a randomly selected individual from the population has the chronic condition.\n- $D^c$: The event that the individual does not have the condition.\n- $T^+$: The event that the assay result for an individual is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the assay result for an individual is negative.\n\nThe information provided in the problem statement can be translated into probabilistic terms.\nThe prevalence of the disease, denoted by $\\pi$, is the prior probability of having the disease:\n$$P(D) = \\pi = 0.03$$\nConsequently, the probability of not having the disease is:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - \\pi = 0.97$$\n\nThe sensitivity of the assay, denoted by $Se$, is the conditional probability of a positive test result given that the individual has the disease:\n$$Se = P(T^+ | D) = 0.92$$\n\nThe specificity of the assay, denoted by $Sp$, is the conditional probability of a negative test result given that the individual does not have the disease:\n$$Sp = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.95$$\n\nThe problem asks for the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and the Negative Predictive Value (NPV).\n\nThe PPV is the conditional probability that an individual has the disease given a positive test result, i.e., $P(D | T^+)$.\nThe NPV is the conditional probability that an individual does not have the disease given a negative test result, i.e., $P(D^c | T^-)$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the PPV. Using the definition of conditional probability (which is the foundation of Bayes' theorem):\n$$\\text{PPV} = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe numerator can be re-written using the definition of conditional probability again: $P(D \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | D)P(D)$.\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, can be expanded using the Law of Total Probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D)P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c)P(D^c)$$\nWe know $P(T^+ | D) = Se$ and $P(D) = \\pi$. The term $P(T^+ | D^c)$ is the probability of a false positive. It is related to the specificity, $Sp = P(T^- | D^c)$. Since the test result is either positive or negative for a person without the disease, $P(T^+ | D^c) + P(T^- | D^c) = 1$. Thus, $P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - Sp$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = Se \\cdot \\pi + (1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - \\pi)$$\nNow, substituting all parts back into the formula for PPV:\n$$\\text{PPV} = \\frac{P(T^+ | D)P(D)}{P(T^+ | D)P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c)P(D^c)} = \\frac{Se \\cdot \\pi}{Se \\cdot \\pi + (1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - \\pi)}$$\nThis is the general expression for PPV in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the NPV. Following a similar procedure:\n$$\\text{NPV} = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(D^c \\cap T^-)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe numerator is $P(D^c \\cap T^-) = P(T^- | D^c)P(D^c)$.\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is found using the Law of Total Probability:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- | D)P(D) + P(T^- | D^c)P(D^c)$$\nWe know $P(T^- | D^c) = Sp$ and $P(D^c) = 1-\\pi$. The term $P(T^- | D)$ is the probability of a false negative. It is related to the sensitivity, $Se = P(T^+ | D)$. Since the test result is either positive or negative for a person with the disease, $P(T^+ | D) + P(T^- | D) = 1$. Thus, $P(T^- | D) = 1 - Se$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(T^-)$:\n$$P(T^-) = (1 - Se) \\cdot \\pi + Sp \\cdot (1 - \\pi)$$\nNow, substituting all parts back into the formula for NPV:\n$$\\text{NPV} = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T^- | D)P(D) + P(T^- | D^c)P(D^c)} = \\frac{Sp \\cdot (1 - \\pi)}{(1 - Se) \\cdot \\pi + Sp \\cdot (1 - \\pi)}$$\nThis is the general expression for NPV.\n\nNow we compute the numerical values using the given data: $\\pi = 0.03$, $Se = 0.92$, $Sp = 0.95$.\n\nFor PPV:\n$$\\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.92 \\cdot 0.03}{0.92 \\cdot 0.03 + (1 - 0.95) \\cdot (1 - 0.03)} = \\frac{0.0276}{0.0276 + 0.05 \\cdot 0.97} = \\frac{0.0276}{0.0276 + 0.0485} = \\frac{0.0276}{0.0761} \\approx 0.362679$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $\\text{PPV} \\approx 0.363$.\n\nFor NPV:\n$$\\text{NPV} = \\frac{0.95 \\cdot (1 - 0.03)}{(1 - 0.92) \\cdot 0.03 + 0.95 \\cdot (1 - 0.03)} = \\frac{0.95 \\cdot 0.97}{0.08 \\cdot 0.03 + 0.95 \\cdot 0.97} = \\frac{0.9215}{0.0024 + 0.9215} = \\frac{0.9215}{0.9239} \\approx 0.997402$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $\\text{NPV} \\approx 0.997$.\n\nFinally, we provide the one-sentence clinical interpretations for these values.\n\nPPV Clinical Interpretation: For a patient from this population who receives a positive test result, there is a $36.3\\%$ probability that they actually have the chronic condition.\n\nNPV Clinical Interpretation: For a patient from this population who receives a negative test result, there is a $99.7\\%$ probability that they are truly free of the chronic condition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.363 & 0.997 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4954900"}, {"introduction": "Even a highly accurate test can produce surprisingly misleading results when applied to a low-prevalence population.
