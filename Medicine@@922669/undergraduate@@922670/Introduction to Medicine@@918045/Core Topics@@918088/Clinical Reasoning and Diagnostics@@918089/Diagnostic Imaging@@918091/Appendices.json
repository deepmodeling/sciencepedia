Calculation of the Liver CT Number**\n\nCT numbers, measured in Hounsfield Units (HU), are defined by a linear transformation of the linear attenuation coefficient ($\\mu$). The problem states that the scaling is linear in the relative difference of a material's $\\mu$ from that of water, $\\mu_{\\text{water}}$. This relationship is formally expressed as:\n$$H(\\mu) = K \\left( \\frac{\\mu - \\mu_{\\text{water}}}{\\mu_{\\text{water}}} \\right)$$\nwhere $H$ is the CT number and $K$ is a scaling constant.\n\nWe determine $K$ using the calibration points provided:\n-   For water, $\\mu = \\mu_{\\text{water}}$, which gives $H(\\mu_{\\text{water}}) = K \\left( \\frac{\\mu_{\\text{water}} - \\mu_{\\text{water}}}{\\mu_{\\text{water}}} \\right) = 0$. This matches the given condition that water maps to $0$ HU.\n-   For air, $\\mu_{\\text{air}} \\approx 0$. The CT number is $H(\\mu_{\\text{air}}) \\approx K \\left( \\frac{0 - \\mu_{\\text{water}}}{\\mu_{\\text{water}}} \\right) = -K$. Since air is stated to map to approximately $-1000$ HU, we have $-K \\approx -1000$, which establishes the standard scaling constant $K = 1000$.\n\nThe formula for the CT number is therefore:\n$$H(\\mu) = 1000 \\left( \\frac{\\mu - \\mu_{\\text{water}}}{\\mu_{\\text{water}}} \\right)$$\n\nWe can now calculate the CT number for the liver, $H_{\\text{liver}}$, using the given values $\\mu_{\\text{liver}} = 0.205\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ and $\\mu_{\\text{water}} = 0.190\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$:\n$$H_{\\text{liver}} = 1000 \\left( \\frac{0.205 - 0.190}{0.190} \\right) = 1000 \\left( \\frac{0.015}{0.190} \\right)$$\n$$H_{\\text{liver}} = \\frac{15}{0.190} \\approx 78.947368... \\text{ HU}$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures as required, we obtain:\n$$H_{\\text{liver}} = 78.95$$\n\n**2. Calculation of the Liver-Spleen Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR)**\n\nThe contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) is defined as the absolute difference in signal between two regions, divided by the noise associated with that difference.\n$$CNR = \\frac{|\\text{Signal}_{\\text{liver}} - \\text{Signal}_{\\text{spleen}}|}{\\text{Noise}_{\\text{difference}}}$$\n\nThe \"signal\" is the mean CT number of the tissue. The contrast, $C$, is the absolute difference between the true CT numbers of the liver and spleen:\n$$C = |H_{\\text{liver}} - H_{\\text{spleen}}|$$\nFirst, we find the CT number for the spleen, $H_{\\text{spleen}}$, using its given attenuation coefficient $\\mu_{\\text{spleen}} = 0.200\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$:\n$$H_{\\text{spleen}} = 1000 \\left( \\frac{\\mu_{\\text{spleen}} - \\mu_{\\text{water}}}{\\mu_{\\text{water}}} \\right) = 1000 \\left( \\frac{0.200 - 0.190}{0.190} \\right) = 1000 \\left( \\frac{0.010}{0.190} \\right)$$\n$$H_{\\text{spleen}} = \\frac{10}{0.190} \\approx 52.631578... \\text{ HU}$$\nThe contrast is then:\n$$C = |78.947368... - 52.631578...| = 26.315789... \\text{ HU}$$\n\nThe noise term in the denominator is the \"propagated noise in the difference of their region means.\" Let the measured mean HU values for the liver and spleen be random variables $\\bar{H}_{\\text{liver, meas}}$ and $\\bar{H}_{\\text{spleen, meas}}$. The noise contributions are independent and additive, with standard deviations $\\sigma_{\\text{liver}} = 8.0$ HU and $\\sigma_{\\text{spleen}} = 8.0$ HU.\nThe difference in measured means is $\\Delta \\bar{H} = \\bar{H}_{\\text{liver, meas}} - \\bar{H}_{\\text{spleen, meas}}$.\nThe standard deviation of this difference, $\\sigma_{\\Delta \\bar{H}}$, is found by adding the variances of the independent noise sources:\n$$\\sigma_{\\Delta \\bar{H}}^2 = \\text{Var}(\\bar{H}_{\\text{liver, meas}}) + \\text{Var}(\\bar{H}_{\\text{spleen, meas}}) = \\sigma_{\\text{liver}}^2 + \\sigma_{\\text{spleen}}^2$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\Delta \\bar{H}} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_{\\text{liver}}^2 + \\sigma_{\\text{spleen}}^2} = \\sqrt{(8.0)^2 + (8.0)^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 64} = \\sqrt{128}$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\Delta \\bar{H}} = \\sqrt{64 \\times 2} = 8\\sqrt{2} \\text{ HU}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the CNR by dividing the contrast by the propagated noise:\n$$CNR = \\frac{C}{\\sigma_{\\Delta \\bar{H}}} = \\frac{26.315789...}{8\\sqrt{2}}$$\n$$CNR \\approx \\frac{26.315789...}{11.313708...} \\approx 2.32594...$$\nRounding this result to three significant figures as required, we get:\n$$CNR = 2.33$$\n\nThe requested values are the liver CT number (rounded to four significant figures) and the liver–spleen CNR (rounded to three significant figures), presented as a row vector.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n78.95 & 2.33\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4953996"}, {"introduction": "The appearance of structures in an ultrasound image is determined by how sound waves interact with tissue boundaries.

We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive the expression for the intensity reflection coefficient, $R_I$, at normal incidence from the fundamental principles of continuity of pressure and particle velocity, evaluate it for the given acoustic impedances, and discuss the resultant ultrasound image characteristics.\n\nLet the interface between the two media be located at the plane $x=0$. Medium $1$ ($x<0$) has acoustic impedance $Z_1$, and medium $2$ ($x>0$) has acoustic impedance $Z_2$. An incident plane harmonic pressure wave, $p_i$, propagates in the $+x$ direction in medium $1$, giving rise to a reflected wave, $p_r$, propagating in the $-x$ direction in medium $1$, and a transmitted wave, $p_t$, propagating in the $+x$ direction in medium $2$.\n\nThe pressure waves can be described in complex exponential form as:\nIncident wave: $$p_i(x,t) = P_i \\exp(j(\\omega t - k_1 x))$$\nReflected wave: $$p_r(x,t) = P_r \\exp(j(\\omega t + k_1 x))$$\nTransmitted wave: $$p_t(x,t) = P_t \\exp(j(\\omega t - k_2 x))$$\nwhere $P_i$, $P_r$, and $P_t$ are the complex pressure amplitudes, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $k_1 = \\omega/c_1$ and $k_2 = \\omega/c_2$ are the wave numbers in the respective media.\n\nThe problem states that for a plane wave, the particle velocity $u$ is related to the pressure $p$ by $u = p/Z$ for a wave propagating in the positive direction. For a wave propagating in the negative direction, the relation is $u = -p/Z$. Thus, the corresponding particle velocities are:\nIncident velocity: $$u_i(x,t) = \\frac{p_i(x,t)}{Z_1}$$\nReflected velocity: $$u_r(x,t) = -\\frac{p_r(x,t)}{Z_1}$$\nTransmitted velocity: $$u_t(x,t) = \\frac{p_t(x,t)}{Z_2}$$\n\nThe boundary conditions at the interface ($x=0$) are:\n1.

Continuity of normal particle velocity: The sum of incident and reflected particle velocity in medium $1$ equals the transmitted particle velocity in medium $2$.\n    $$u_i(0,t) + u_r(0,t) = u_t(0,t)$$\n    $$\\frac{P_i}{Z_1} \\exp(j\\omega t) - \\frac{P_r}{Z_1} \\exp(j\\omega t) = \\frac{P_t}{Z_2} \\exp(j\\omega t)$$\n    Dividing by $\\exp(j\\omega t)$ gives the second equation for the amplitudes:\n    $$\\frac{P_i - P_r}{Z_1} = \\frac{P_t}{Z_2} \\quad (2)$$\n\nWe now solve these two equations to find the pressure reflection coefficient, defined as $R_p = P_r / P_i$.\nSubstitute equation $(1)$ into equation $(2)$:\n$$\\frac{P_i - P_r}{Z_1} = \\frac{P_i + P_r}{Z_2}$$\n$$Z_2(P_i - P_r) = Z_1(P_i + P_r)$$\n$$Z_2 P_i - Z_2 P_r = Z_1 P_i + Z_1 P_r$$\nRearrange to group terms with $P_i$ and $P_r$:\n$$P_i(Z_2 - Z_1) = P_r(Z_1 + Z_2)$$\nSolving for the ratio $R_p = P_r/P_i$:\n$$R_p = \\frac{P_r}{P_i} = \\frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_2 + Z_1}$$\nThe intensity of a plane acoustic wave, $I$, is given by the time-averaged power per unit area, which is related to the pressure amplitude magnitude $|P|$ and acoustic impedance $Z$ by $I = \\frac{|P|^2}{2Z}$.\n\nThe intensity reflection coefficient, $R_I$, is the ratio of the reflected intensity to the incident intensity.\n$$R_I = \\frac{I_r}{I_i} = \\frac{|P_r|^2 / (2Z_1)}{|P_i|^2 / (2Z_1)} = \\frac{|P_r|^2}{|P_i|^2} = \\left| \\frac{P_r}{P_i} \\right|^2 = |R_p|^2$$\nSince the problem specifies lossless media, the acoustic impedances $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are real quantities. Therefore, $R_p$ is real, and we can write:\n$$R_I = \\left( \\frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_2 + Z_1} \\right)^2$$\nThis is the derived expression for the intensity reflection coefficient.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for the given values: $Z_1 = 1.6$ MRayl and $Z_2 = 7.0$ MRayl.\n$$R_I = \\left( \\frac{7.0 - 1.6}{7.0 + 1.6} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{5.4}{8.6} \\right)^2$$\n$$R_I = (0.6279069...)^2 \\approx 0.394267...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the intensity reflection coefficient is $0.3943$.\n\nFinally, we reason about the qualitative ultrasound appearance at the interface.\nThe calculated intensity reflection coefficient, $R_I \\approx 0.3943$, signifies that approximately $39.4\\%$ of the incident ultrasound intensity is reflected at the soft tissue-bone interface. This is a very large reflection. In B-mode ultrasound imaging, the brightness of an interface (its echogenicity) is proportional to the strength of the reflected signal. Therefore, the soft tissue-bone interface will appear hyperechoic (very bright).\n\nTo discuss phenomena occurring posterior to the interface, such as shadowing, we must consider attenuation, which was neglected for the idealized reflection calculation. The necessary assumption is: **Cortical bone has a much higher acoustic attenuation coefficient than soft tissue.** This is a well-established physical property.\n\nPosterior acoustic shadowing is the anechoic (dark) region seen on an image distal to a structure. This phenomenon arises here from a combination of two effects:\n1.  **High Reflection:** The strong reflection at the interface means that only a fraction of the energy, the transmitted intensity $I_t$, penetrates the bone. The intensity transmission coefficient is $T_I = 1 - R_I \\approx 1 - 0.3943 = 0.6057$. Thus, only about $60.6\\%$ of the energy enters the bone.\n2.  **High Attenuation:** The ultrasound energy that does enter the bone is then rapidly absorbed and scattered due to the high attenuation coefficient of osseous tissue.\n\nThe combination of a large energy loss due to reflection and subsequent rapid energy loss due to attenuation within the bone means that very little to no ultrasound energy can pass through the bone, reflect off deeper structures, and return to the transducer. The absence of these returning echoes from the region behind the bone results in a pronounced posterior acoustic shadow.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3943}$$", "id": "4954078"}, {"introduction": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging ($MRI$) derives its exceptional soft-tissue contrast from its sensitivity to the chemical environment of protons.

The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe origin of chemical shift artifacts in MRI is rooted in the fact that the resonant frequency of nuclear spins—protons ($^1\\text{H}$) in clinical imaging—is not solely dependent on the external magnetic field, but is also minutely altered by the local electronic environment of the nucleus.\n\n**Explanation of Type 1 Chemical Shift Artifact (Spatial Misregistration)**\n\nThe fundamental principle of spatial encoding in MRI along one direction, known as the frequency-encoding direction (conventionally the $x$-axis), is the application of a linear magnetic field gradient, $G_x$, simultaneously with the signal readout. This gradient superimposes a position-dependent magnetic field onto the main static field $B_0$. The total magnetic field at a position $x$ becomes $B(x) = B_{0} + G_x x$.\n\nAccording to the Larmor equation, the precession frequency of a spin is directly proportional to the magnetic field it experiences: $f(x) = (\\gamma/2\\pi) B(x)$. Therefore, the frequency of a water proton at position $x$ is:\n$$f_{W}(x) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} (B_{0} + G_x x)$$\nThe imaging system demodulates the signal relative to the center frequency $f_c = (\\gamma/2\\pi)B_0$, and the remaining frequency content $\\Delta f_x = f(x) - f_c = (\\gamma/2\\pi)G_x x$ is used to assign a spatial location. The reconstruction process, typically via a Fourier Transform, establishes a one-to-one mapping between frequency and spatial position. A specific frequency in the received signal is assumed to correspond to a unique spatial coordinate.\n\nHowever, protons in fat molecules are more electronically shielded than protons in water molecules. This shielding slightly reduces the effective magnetic field experienced by the fat protons, causing them to precess at a lower frequency. This frequency difference, $\\Delta f$, is a product of the chemical shift offset, $\\Delta \\sigma$, and the Larmor frequency at the main field $B_0$:\n$$\\Delta f = \\Delta \\sigma \\times f_{0} = \\Delta \\sigma \\times \\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_{0}\\right)$$\nThis frequency difference is constant across the field of view, as it depends on $B_0$, not the gradient field. Consequently, at the same physical location $x$, a fat proton will have a resonance frequency:\n$$f_{F}(x) = f_{W}(x) - \\Delta f = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} (B_{0} + G_x x) - \\Delta f$$\nThe MRI system is unaware of this intrinsic frequency difference. It interprets the frequency $f_{F}(x)$ as originating from a water proton at a different location, let's call it $x'$, where $f_{W}(x') = f_{F}(x)$.\n$$\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} (B_{0} + G_x x') = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} (B_{0} + G_x x) - \\Delta f$$\nSolving for $x'$:\n$$\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x x' = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x x - \\Delta f$$\n$$x' = x - \\frac{\\Delta f}{(\\gamma/2\\pi) G_x}$$\nThis shows that the signal from fat at position $x$ is incorrectly mapped to position $x'$, resulting in a spatial shift of magnitude $\\Delta x_{\\text{shift}} = |x - x'| = \\frac{\\Delta f}{(\\gamma/2\\pi) G_x}$. The fat signal is displaced relative to the water signal along the frequency-encoding direction.\n\n**Explanation of Type 2 Chemical Shift Artifact (India-Ink Artifact)**\n\nThis artifact arises from the phase difference that accumulates between fat and water signals within a single voxel, particularly at boundaries between fatty and aqueous tissues. After an RF excitation pulse, both fat and water spin populations begin to precess in the transverse plane, initially in phase. However, due to their frequency difference $\\Delta f$, a relative phase difference $\\Delta \\phi$ develops over time $t$:\n$$\\Delta \\phi(t) = 2\\pi (\\Delta f) t$$\nThe total signal $S(t)$ from a voxel containing both fat and water is the vector sum of their respective magnetization signals, $S_F$ and $S_W$. In a gradient-echo (GRE) sequence, the signal is acquired at an echo time $T_E$. The total signal magnitude at $T_E$ will depend on the relative phase $\\Delta \\phi(T_E)$.\n- If $\\Delta \\phi(T_E) = 2n\\pi$ for an integer $n$, the signals are in-phase, resulting in constructive interference: $|S| = |S_W| + |S_F|$.\n- If $\\Delta \\phi(T_E) = (2n+1)\\pi$ for an integer $n$, the signals are out-of-phase, resulting in destructive interference: $|S| = ||S_W| - |S_F||$.\n\nAt an interface where a voxel contains a mixture of fat and water, if the echo time $T_E$ is chosen such that the two signals are out-of-phase, they will partially or completely cancel each other. This causes a significant signal loss in those boundary voxels, creating a dark, ink-like line separating the fat and water tissues. This is the \"India-ink\" or black boundary artifact.\n\n**Derivation and Calculation of Pixel Shift**\n\nThe spatial shift artifact can be quantified in terms of pixels.\nThe bandwidth per pixel, $\\text{BW}_{\\text{pixel}}$, is the frequency range that the system maps to one pixel width. It is the total readout bandwidth, $\\text{BW}_{\\text{read}}$, divided by the number of samples (pixels) in the frequency-encoding direction, $N_x$:\n$$\\text{BW}_{\\text{pixel}} = \\frac{\\text{BW}_{\\text{read}}}{N_x}$$\nThe spatial shift in units of pixels, $\\Delta x_{\\text{pixels}}$, is the chemical frequency shift, $\\Delta f$, divided by the bandwidth per pixel:\n$$\\Delta x_{\\text{pixels}} = \\frac{\\Delta f}{\\text{BW}_{\\text{pixel}}} = \\frac{\\Delta f \\cdot N_x}{\\text{BW}_{\\text{read}}}$$\nThe problem provides the relations $\\Delta f = \\Delta \\sigma \\times f_{0}$ and $f_{0} = (\\gamma / 2\\pi) B_{0}$. Substituting these into the expression for pixel shift yields the desired analytic expression:\n$$\\Delta x_{\\text{pixels}} = \\frac{\\left( \\Delta \\sigma \\times \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_{0} \\right) N_x}{\\text{BW}_{\\text{read}}}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n- $B_{0} = 1.5 \\ \\text{T}$\n- $\\gamma / 2\\pi = 42.58 \\ \\text{MHz/T} = 42.58 \\times 10^6 \\ \\text{Hz/T}$\n- $\\Delta \\sigma = 3.5 \\ \\text{ppm} = 3.5 \\times 10^{-6}$\n- $N_{x} = 320$\n- $\\text{BW}_{\\text{read}} = 64{,}000 \\ \\text{Hz}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the frequency shift $\\Delta f$:\n$$f_{0} = (42.58 \\times 10^6 \\ \\text{Hz/T}) \\times 1.5 \\ \\text{T} = 63.87 \\times 10^6 \\ \\text{Hz}$$\n$$\\Delta f = (3.5 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (63.87 \\times 10^6 \\ \\text{Hz}) = 223.545 \\ \\text{Hz}$$\nNext, we calculate the pixel shift:\n$$\\Delta x_{\\text{pixels}} = \\frac{223.545 \\ \\text{Hz} \\times 320}{64{,}000 \\ \\text{Hz}} = \\frac{71534.4}{64000} \\approx 1.117725$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the displacement is $1.12$ pixels.\n\n**Mitigation Techniques**\n\nTwo distinct methods grounded in the underlying physics can be employed to mitigate these artifacts:\n\n1.  **Increase Readout Bandwidth**: The derived expression for the Type 1 pixel shift, $\\Delta x_{\\text{pixels}} = (\\Delta f \\cdot N_x) / \\text{BW}_{\\text{read}}$, shows that the shift is inversely proportional to the readout bandwidth $\\text{BW}_{\\text{read}}$. By increasing the receiver bandwidth, the bandwidth per pixel ($\\text{BW}_{\\text{pixel}}$) is made larger. The constant frequency offset $\\Delta f$ between fat and water then corresponds to a smaller fraction of a pixel's frequency range, thereby reducing the spatial misregistration. For example, doubling the bandwidth would halve the pixel shift. This directly mitigates the Type 1 artifact. The primary trade-off is a reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as SNR is proportional to $1/\\sqrt{\\text{BW}}$. This method does not inherently correct the Type 2 (phase cancellation) artifact.\n\n2.  **Fat Suppression using Chemical Selectivity**: Both types of chemical shift artifacts exist because a signal is simultaneously detected from fat and water. A powerful mitigation strategy is to eliminate the signal from one of the components. This can be achieved with a frequency-selective saturation pulse. Before the main imaging sequence, a narrow-bandwidth RF pulse, centered precisely at the Larmor frequency of fat, is applied. This pulse selectively excites the fat protons, rotating their magnetization into the transverse plane. A strong magnetic field gradient (a \"spoiler\") is then applied to rapidly dephase this transverse magnetization. When the main imaging sequence begins moments later, the longitudinal magnetization of the fat protons has not had sufficient time to recover. As a result, fat contributes little to no signal, and the artifacts caused by its presence—both spatial misregistration and phase cancellation—are eliminated. This technique relies directly on the chemical shift frequency difference to selectively null the fat signal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.12}$$", "id": "4954066"}]}
