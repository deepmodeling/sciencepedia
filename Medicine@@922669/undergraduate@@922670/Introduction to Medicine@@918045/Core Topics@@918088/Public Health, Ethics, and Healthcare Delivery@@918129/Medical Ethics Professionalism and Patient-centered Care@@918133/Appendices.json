The patient reports the following utilities (benefit or harm) for test-related outcomes, reflecting both psychological and clinical considerations: utility of a true positive $u_{TP} = +1$, utility of a false positive $u_{FP} = -0.5$, utility of a true negative $u_{TN} = 0$, and utility of a false negative $u_{FN} = -5$.

In these situations, how do we best honor their autonomy and act in their best interest? This practice explores this dilemma by modeling the choice between 'substituted judgment' (following prior wishes) and the 'best-interest' standard using a simple but powerful decision-theoretic framework.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires us to first derive a general decision rule for choosing between substituted judgment and a best-interest standard based on an expected moral loss framework, and then to apply a specific institutional policy to a given case.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the General Decision Rule**\n\nWe begin from first principles as outlined in the problem: respect for autonomy, beneficence, and nonmaleficence, formalized through an expected-loss framework.\n\nLet's define the components of our decision problem:\n1.  **States of the World**: These relate to the patient's true, authentic preference, which is unknown. Let the preference reported by the spouse (to avoid long-term ventilation) be denoted $P_{rep}$. There are two possible states regarding the patient's true preference, $P_{true}$:\n    *   State $A$: The patient's true preference matches the reported preference ($P_{true} = P_{rep}$).\n    *   State $\\neg A$: The patient's true preference is the opposite of the reported preference ($P_{true} \\neq P_{rep}$).\n\n2.  **Probabilities of States**: The problem defines preference reliability, $r$, as the probability that the reported preference matches the patient's authentic values.\n    *   The probability of State $A$ is $P(A) = r$.\n    *   The probability of State $\\neg A$ is $P(\\neg A) = 1 - r$.\n\n3.  **Actions**: The decision-maker can choose one of two actions.\n    *   Action $S$: Use Substituted Judgment. This means we accept the spouse's report and act on the preference $P_{rep}$ (i.e., avoid ventilation).\n    *   Action $B$: Use the Best-Interest standard. In the absence of a known preference, this standard typically defaults to preserving life. We model this as taking the action opposite to the reported preference (i.e., provide ventilation).\n\n4.  **Moral Loss Function**: We must define the moral loss, $L(\\text{action, state})$, for each of the four possible outcomes. This loss quantifies the degree of failure to uphold the ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, and nonmaleficence.\n    *   $L(S, A)$: We follow the patient's true preference. This perfectly respects autonomy. The moral loss is zero. $L(S, A) = 0$.\n    *   $L(S, \\neg A)$: We follow an incorrect report, leading to an outcome contrary to the patient's true preference (e.g., withholding wanted treatment). This is a severe violation of autonomy and potentially nonmaleficence. Let's assign this a moral loss value of $L_1 > 0$.\n    *   $L(B, A)$: We override the patient's true preference, imposing an outcome the patient would not have wanted (e.g., providing unwanted treatment). This is a violation of autonomy. Let's assign this a moral loss value of $L_2 > 0$.\n    *   $L(B, \\neg A)$: We override an incorrect report, and our action happens to align with the patient's true preference. This outcome respects autonomy (by chance) and is consistent with beneficence. The moral loss is zero. $L(B, \\neg A) = 0$.\n\nThe decision rule will be to choose the action that minimizes the expected moral loss.\n\n**Expected Moral Loss of Substituted Judgment (Action $S$)**:\nThe expected loss, $E[L(S)]$, is the sum of the losses of each outcome weighted by their probabilities:\n$$E[L(S)] = P(A) \\cdot L(S, A) + P(\\neg A) \\cdot L(S, \\neg A)$$\n$$E[L(S)] = r \\cdot 0 + (1 - r) \\cdot L_1 = (1 - r)L_1$$\n\n**Expected Moral Loss of Best Interest (Action $B$)**:\nThe expected loss, $E[L(B)]$, is calculated similarly:\n$$E[L(B)] = P(A) \\cdot L(B, A) + P(\\neg A) \\cdot L(B, \\neg A)$$\n$$E[L(B)] = r \\cdot L_2 + (1 - r) \\cdot 0 = rL_2$$\n\n**Deriving the Decision Threshold**:\nThe principle of minimizing expected moral loss dictates that we should choose Substituted Judgment (Action $S$) if and only if $E[L(S)]  E[L(B)]$.\n$$(1 - r)L_1  rL_2$$\nTo find the condition on $r$, we solve the inequality:\n$$L_1 - rL_1  rL_2$$\n$$L_1  rL_1 + rL_2$$\n$$L_1  r(L_1 + L_2)$$\nAssuming $L_1 + L_2 > 0$, which is assured as $L_1 > 0$ and $L_2 > 0$, we can divide without changing the inequality's direction:\n$$r > \\frac{L_1}{L_1 + L_2}$$\nThis is the general decision rule. Substituted judgment should be used if the preference reliability $r$ exceeds a critical threshold, $r_{crit} = \\frac{L_1}{L_1 + L_2}$. This threshold is determined by the relative moral weights assigned to the two types of errors: failing to provide a desired treatment ($L_1$) versus imposing an undesired treatment ($L_2$). The decision indicator $D$ for \"use substituted judgment\" is $1$ if $r > r_{crit}$, and $0$ otherwise.\n\n**Part 2: Application to the Specific Case**\n\nThe problem provides the specific decision rule used by the institution, which obviates the need to know the specific values of $L_1$ and $L_2$.\n*   Institutional Policy: \"adopt substituted judgment when the estimated preference reliability exceeds $0.60$\".\nThis directly gives us the critical threshold:\n$$r_{crit} = 0.60$$\n\nThe problem also provides the data for the specific case:\n*   Spouse's calibrated confidence: This is the estimated preference reliability, $r$.\n$$r = 0.70$$\n\nThe decision variable $D$ is defined as:\n*   $D=1$ for substituted judgment.\n*   $D=0$ for best interest.\n\nAccording to the derived framework and the institution's policy, we should use substituted judgment if $r > r_{crit}$. We compare the given value of $r$ to the threshold $r_{crit}$.\n$$0.70 > 0.60$$\nThe condition is met. Therefore, the decision is to use substituted judgment.

This exercise simulates a common quality improvement scenario, asking you to evaluate a protocol designed to reduce errors during patient handoffs.

Express your final numerical result as a single decimal number for the relative risk reduction, rounded to three significant figures. Do not use a percentage sign.", "solution": "The problem will be addressed in two parts as requested: first, the derivation and computation of the relative risk reduction, and second, the ethical justification for mandating the protocol.\n\n#### Part 1: Relative Risk Reduction (RRR)\n\nIn this context, the \"risk\" is defined as the probability of a clinically significant handoff error occurring during a single transition of care.\n\nLet $R_{baseline}$ be the baseline risk, which corresponds to the pre-intervention error probability.\n$$R_{baseline} = P_{pre} = 0.15$$\n\nLet $R_{intervention}$ be the risk in the intervention group, which corresponds to the post-intervention error probability.\n$$R_{intervention} = P_{post} = 0.08$$\n\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) is the simple difference between the baseline risk and the intervention risk. It represents the absolute decrease in the rate of adverse events.\n$$ARR = R_{baseline} - R_{intervention}$$\n\nThe Relative Risk Reduction (RRR) measures the proportional reduction in risk. It is the absolute risk reduction normalized by the baseline risk. This answers the question, \"By what proportion did the intervention reduce the risk relative to the original risk?\"\n\nThe expression for RRR is derived as:\n$$RRR = \\frac{ARR}{R_{baseline}} = \\frac{R_{baseline} - R_{intervention}}{R_{baseline}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values into this expression:\n$$RRR = \\frac{0.15 - 0.08}{0.15}$$\n$$RRR = \\frac{0.07}{0.15}$$\n\nTo compute the numerical value, we perform the division:\n$$RRR = \\frac{7}{15} \\approx 0.46666...$$\n\nRounding this result to three significant figures as required by the problem statement yields:\n$$RRR \\approx 0.467$$\n\n#### Part 2: Ethical Justification\n\nThe ethical defensibility of mandating the protocol is evaluated against the four core principles of medical ethics, using the RRR calculation as quantitative evidence for the protocol's effectiveness.\n\n1.  **Beneficence (to do good):** This principle obligates healthcare professionals to act in the best interests of their patients. The protocol demonstrably reduces the probability of clinically significant handoff errors from $0.15$ to $0.08$. This is a substantial reduction in risk, quantified by the relative risk reduction of approximately $0.467$. This means the protocol prevents nearly $47\\%$ of the errors that would have otherwise occurred. By preventing potential harm and improving patient safety, mandating the protocol is a direct act of beneficence.\n\n2.  **Non-maleficence (to do no harm):** This principle requires avoiding causation of harm. A clinically significant handoff error represents a direct or potential harm to a patient. The pre-intervention state, with a $0.15$ error probability, carries a substantial inherent risk of iatrogenic harm. Reducing this risk is a primary ethical duty. The problem states the protocol imposes \"minimal time burden and is cost-neutral,\" which is crucial. These assumptions imply that the implementation of the protocol does not introduce new, significant harms, such as clinician burnout or diversion of resources from other essential patient care activities. Therefore, mandating the protocol strongly upholds the principle of non-maleficence by mitigating a known source of patient harm without creating new ones.\n\n3.  **Respect for Autonomy:** This principle involves respecting the decision-making capacities of autonomous persons.\n    -   **Patient Autonomy:** Patients consent to medical care with the reasonable expectation that it will be delivered safely and according to the best available evidence. A protocol that is proven to reduce errors and improve safety aligns perfectly with this expectation. Mandating the protocol can be seen as honoring the patient's implicit choice for the safest possible care, thereby respecting their autonomy.\n    -   **Professional Autonomy:** A mandate might be perceived as a constraint on the autonomy of healthcare professionals. However, professional autonomy is not absolute. It is bounded by the supervening obligation to provide evidence-based, safe, and effective care. When a low-burden intervention is shown to produce a significant improvement in patient safety, the ethical imperative to protect patients (beneficence and non-maleficence) outweighs the professional's preference for unstandardized practice. The standardization of high-risk procedures is a fundamental component of modern safety science and professionalism.\n\n4.  **Justice:** This principle concerns the fair distribution of benefits, risks, and costs. Mandating a standardized protocol ensures that all patients within the system receive the same high level of protection from handoff errors. It promotes equity by eliminating variations in safety that might arise from the differing, non-standard practices of individual clinicians or teams. Every patient benefits equally from the reduced risk, which is a just distribution of the intervention's benefits. The cost-neutral nature of the protocol ensures that its implementation does not create financial inequities or resource allocation conflicts.\n\n**Conclusion of Ethical Analysis:** Based on the analysis of these four principles, mandating the protocol is not only ethically defensible but ethically imperative. The significant, quantifiable benefit to patient safety (beneficence, non-maleficence) and the equitable distribution of this benefit (justice) provide a powerful justification that overrides the minor constraint on professional autonomy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.467}$$", "id": "4968703"}]}
