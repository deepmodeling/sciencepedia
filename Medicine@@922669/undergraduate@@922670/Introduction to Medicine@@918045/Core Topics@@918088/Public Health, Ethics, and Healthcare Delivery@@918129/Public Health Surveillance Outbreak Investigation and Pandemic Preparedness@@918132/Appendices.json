This exercise simulates a classic foodborne outbreak scenario, challenging you to calculate the fundamental measures of disease frequency and association. By computing attack rates, risk ratios, and rate ratios, you will practice distinguishing between the cumulative risk over a period and the instantaneous rate of new cases, skills that are foundational to epidemiological analysis [@problem_id:4977747].", "problem": "A suspected foodborne outbreak occurs following a school banquet. Investigators construct a closed cohort over $1$ month of surveillance starting the day after the event. Among those who ate the implicated dish (exposed), there are $1{,}000$ students; among those who did not eat it (unexposed), there are $2{,}000$ students. Over the $1$-month period, there are $80$ new illness episodes among the exposed and $60$ among the unexposed that meet the case definition. Because of short absences and early departures, accrued person-time totals $800$ person-months in the exposed and $1{,}900$ person-months in the unexposed.\n\nUsing only core epidemiologic definitions for cumulative incidence (risk), incidence rate (incidence density), attack rate, risk ratio, and rate ratio as your starting point, do the following:\n\n1. Compute the attack rates in the exposed and unexposed groups over the $1$-month period, and from these compute the risk ratio comparing exposed to unexposed.\n2.

We will first define the necessary terms, then compute the values as requested.\n\nThe following data are given:\n- Number of exposed individuals, $N_e = 1{,}000$.\n- Number of unexposed individuals, $N_u = 2{,}000$.\n- Number of new cases in the exposed group, $I_e = 80$.\n- Number of new cases in the unexposed group, $I_u = 60$.\n- Person-time at risk in the exposed group, $PT_e = 800$ person-months.\n- Person-time at risk in the unexposed group, $PT_u = 1{,}900$ person-months.\n\n1.  **Attack Rates and Risk Ratio**\n\nThe **attack rate (AR)** is a form of cumulative incidence (risk) calculated for a specific group over a defined period during an epidemic. It is the proportion of individuals at risk who develop the illness.\n$$\n\\text{AR} = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases}}{\\text{Number of people at risk}}\n$$\nWe calculate the attack rate for the exposed ($AR_e$) and unexposed ($AR_u$) groups.\n\nFor the exposed group:\n$$\nAR_e = \\frac{I_e}{N_e} = \\frac{80}{1{,}000} = 0.08\n$$\nAs specified, rounding to four decimal places gives $AR_e = 0.0800$.\n\nFor the unexposed group:\n$$\nAR_u = \\frac{I_u}{N_u} = \\frac{60}{2{,}000} = 0.03\n$$\nRounding to four decimal places gives $AR_u = 0.0300$.\n\nThe **risk ratio (RR)**, also known as the cumulative incidence ratio, compares the risk of disease in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group.\n$$\n\\text{RR} = \\frac{AR_e}{AR_u}\n$$\nUsing the calculated attack rates:\n$$\n\\text{RR} = \\frac{0.08}{0.03} = \\frac{8}{3} \\approx 2.666...\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the risk ratio is $\\text{RR} \\approx 2.67$.\n\n2.  **Incidence Rates and Rate Ratio**\n\nThe **incidence rate (IR)**, or incidence density, measures the rate at which new cases occur in a population over time. It is calculated by dividing the number of new cases by the total person-time at risk.\n$$\n\\text{IR} = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases}}{\\text{Total person-time at risk}}\n$$\nWe calculate the incidence rate for the exposed ($IR_e$) and unexposed ($IR_u$) groups.\n\nFor the exposed group:\n$$\nIR_e = \\frac{I_e}{PT_e} = \\frac{80 \\text{ cases}}{800 \\text{ person-months}} = 0.1 \\frac{\\text{cases}}{\\text{person-month}}\n$$\n\nFor the unexposed group:\n$$\nIR_u = \\frac{I_u}{PT_u} = \\frac{60 \\text{ cases}}{1{,}900 \\text{ person-months}} = \\frac{6}{190} \\frac{\\text{cases}}{\\text{person-month}} \\approx 0.031578... \\frac{\\text{cases}}{\\text{person-month}}\n$$\n\nThe **rate ratio (IRR)**, also known as the incidence density ratio, compares the incidence rate of disease in the exposed group to the incidence rate in the unexposed group.\n$$\n\\text{IRR} = \\frac{IR_e}{IR_u}\n$$\nUsing the calculated incidence rates:\n$$\n\\text{IRR} = \\frac{80/800}{60/1900} = \\frac{0.1}{60/1900} = 0.1 \\times \\frac{1900}{60} = \\frac{190}{60} = \\frac{19}{6} \\approx 3.1666...\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the rate ratio is $\\text{IRR} \\approx 3.17$.\n\n3.  **Interpretation of Attack Rates**\n\nThe attack rates represent the risk of becoming ill during the one-month period for each group. Over the one-month surveillance period, the risk of developing illness was $8.00\\%$ among students who ate the implicated dish and $3.00\\%$ among those who did not.\n\nThe final answer requires only the four computed numerical values in the specified order: exposed attack rate, unexposed attack rate, risk ratio, and rate ratio.\n- Exposed attack rate: $0.0800$\n- Unexposed attack rate: $0.0300$\n- Risk ratio: $2.67$\n- Rate ratio: $3.17$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.0800  0.0300  2.67  3.17 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4977747"}, {"introduction": "Effective public health surveillance relies on interpreting data from diagnostic tests, but a test's result is not always a straightforward indicator of truth. This practice explores the real-world performance of a diagnostic tool by examining its predictive values, which depend critically on both the test's intrinsic characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) and the disease's prevalence in the population. You will apply Bayesian reasoning to calculate the Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$) and Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$), and see how our confidence in a diagnosis changes with accumulating evidence from multiple tests [@problem_id:4977769].", "problem": "A citywide syndromic surveillance program monitors influenza-like illness and estimates the point prevalence of active infection in adult outpatients to be $0.02$. A rapid antigen test used in the program has sensitivity $0.85$ and specificity $0.97$ for detecting current infection. For a patient without prior testing, the test is performed twice on separate swabs by independent technicians within the same visit; conditional on true disease status, the two test results can be assumed independent and identically distributed with the same sensitivity and specificity.\n\nUsing only the fundamental definitions of sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and conditional probability, and adopting scientifically standard reasoning to combine independent evidence, determine the following for this surveillance context:\n\n- The positive predictive value (PPV), defined as the probability of true infection given a single positive rapid test result.\n- The negative predictive value (NPV), defined as the probability of no infection given a single negative rapid test result.\n- The posterior probability of true infection after two independent positive rapid test results on the same patient.\n\nExpress each probability as a decimal and round your answers to four significant figures.

Positive Predictive Value (PPV) for a Single Test**\n\nThe PPV is the probability of having the disease given a positive test result, which is $P(D | T^+)$. We use Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nTo find the denominator, $P(T^+)$, we apply the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(T^+) = (0.85)(0.02) + (0.03)(0.98) = 0.017 + 0.0294 = 0.0464$$\nNow we can compute the PPV:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{0.017}{0.0464} \\approx 0.3663793...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the PPV is $0.3664$.\n\n**2. Negative Predictive Value (NPV) for a Single Test**\n\nThe NPV is the probability of not having the disease given a negative test result, which is $P(D^c | T^-)$. Again, we use Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nFirst, we find the denominator, $P(T^-)$, using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- | D) P(D) + P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$P(T^-) = (0.15)(0.02) + (0.97)(0.98) = 0.003 + 0.9506 = 0.9536$$\n(As a consistency check, note that $P(T^+) + P(T^-) = 0.0464 + 0.9536 = 1.0000$, as expected.)\nNow we compute the NPV:\n$$P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{(0.97)(0.98)}{0.9536} = \\frac{0.9506}{0.9536} \\approx 0.9968540...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the NPV is $0.9969$.\n\n**3. Posterior Probability of Infection After Two Positive Tests**\n\nLet $T_1^+$ and $T_2^+$ be the events of the first and second tests being positive, respectively. We want to find the posterior probability $P(D | T_1^+ \\cap T_2^+)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D | T_1^+ \\cap T_2^+) = \\frac{P(T_1^+ \\cap T_2^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T_1^+ \\cap T_2^+)}$$\nThe problem states that the tests are independent conditional on the true disease status. Therefore:\n$$P(T_1^+ \\cap T_2^+ | D) = P(T_1^+ | D) \\times P(T_2^+ | D) = (0.85) \\times (0.85) = (0.85)^2 = 0.7225$$\nAnd similarly for the non-diseased state:\n$$P(T_1^+ \\cap T_2^+ | D^c) = P(T_1^+ | D^c) \\times P(T_2^+ | D^c) = (0.03) \\times (0.03) = (0.03)^2 = 0.0009$$\nNext, we find the denominator, $P(T_1^+ \\cap T_2^+)$, using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T_1^+ \\cap T_2^+) = P(T_1^+ \\cap T_2^+ | D) P(D) + P(T_1^+ \\cap T_2^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$P(T_1^+ \\cap T_2^+) = (0.7225)(0.02) + (0.0009)(0.98) = 0.01445 + 0.000882 = 0.015332$$\nFinally, we compute the desired posterior probability:\n$$P(D | T_1^+ \\cap T_2^+) = \\frac{(0.7225)(0.02)}{0.015332} = \\frac{0.01445}{0.015332} \\approx 0.9424732...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the posterior probability is $0.9425$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.3664  0.9969  0.9425 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4977769"}]}
