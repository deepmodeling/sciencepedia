This practice [@problem_id:4966038] challenges you to translate raw clinical trial data into patient-centered metrics that foster genuine understanding.

The concepts of event rates ($p_c$, $p_t$), absolute risk reduction ($ARR$), relative risk reduction ($RRR$), and the number needed to treat ($NNT$) are foundational metrics used to evaluate the efficacy of medical interventions. The given event rates are realistic for a clinical trial scenario.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information ($p_c$ and $p_t$) to calculate the required quantities. The definitions for $ARR$, $RRR$, and $NNT$ are standard and allow for the computation of a unique, stable solution.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in objective, precise language. It describes a standard clinical scenario and asks for quantitative analysis and a description of a communication strategy based on that analysis. There are no subjective or opinion-based claims.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. There is no missing information required for the calculations, nor are there any contradictory constraints.\n-   **Feasibility:** The scenario and data are entirely realistic and plausible within the context of clinical medicine and pharmacology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. It represents a standard application of fundamental concepts in evidence-based medicine. Therefore, a full solution will be provided.\n\n---\n\nThe solution proceeds by defining and calculating the required statistical measures of treatment effect. The provided event rates are the risk of the adverse event in the control and treatment populations, respectively.\n\nLet $p_c$ be the event rate in the control group, and $p_t$ be the event rate in the treatment group.\nGiven:\n$p_c = 0.20$ (also known as the Control Event Rate, $CER$)\n$p_t = 0.12$ (also known as the Experimental Event Rate, $EER$)\n\n**1. Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$)**\nThe absolute risk reduction is the absolute difference in the event rates between the control group and the treatment group. It quantifies the absolute decrease in risk associated with the treatment.\nThe formula for $ARR$ is:\n$$ARR = p_c - p_t$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ARR = 0.20 - 0.12 = 0.08$$\n\n**2. Relative Risk Reduction ($RRR$)**\nThe relative risk reduction describes the reduction in risk in the treated group relative to the control group. First, we compute the Relative Risk ($RR$), which is the ratio of the risk in the treated group to the risk in the control group.\n$$RR = \\frac{p_t}{p_c}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$RR = \\frac{0.12}{0.20} = 0.60$$\nThe $RRR$ is the proportional reduction in this risk, calculated as $1$ minus the $RR$.\n$$RRR = 1 - RR$$\n$$RRR = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$$\nAlternatively, the $RRR$ can be calculated as the absolute risk reduction divided by the control group's event rate:\n$$RRR = \\frac{p_c - p_t}{p_c} = \\frac{ARR}{p_c}$$\n$$RRR = \\frac{0.08}{0.20} = 0.40$$\nBoth methods yield the same result, confirming the calculation. The relative risk reduction is $0.40$, or $40\\%$.\n\n**3. Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$)**\nThe number needed to treat is a measure of clinical effort. It represents the average number of patients who must be treated with the specific intervention for a defined period (here, one year) to prevent one additional adverse event compared to the control intervention. It is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction.\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nUsing the calculated value for $ARR$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.08} = 12.5$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to three significant figures. The value $12.5$ already has three significant figures ($1$, $2$, and $5$), so no further rounding is necessary.\n\n**4. Framing the Benefit for Informed Consent**\nTo communicate the benefit in lay terms while maintaining objectivity and confidentiality, the physician should translate these aggregate statistics into natural frequencies, which are more intuitive for patients. This approach inherently respects the privacy of trial participants as it uses only summary data.\n\nA proper framing would avoid the potentially misleading nature of the $RRR$ (a \"$40\\%$ risk reduction\" sounds more impressive than the absolute numbers might warrant) and instead focus on the $ARR$ and the $NNT$. The physician could state:\n\n\"Based on large clinical studies, we can estimate what might happen over the course of one year. Without this new medication, for a group of $100$ people similar to you, we would expect about $20$ to experience [the adverse event]. With the new medication, we would expect that number to drop to about $12$ people. This means that for every $100$ people who take this medication for a year, we prevent the event from happening in about $8$ of them. Another way to look at it is that we need to treat about $12$ to $13$ people like you for one year to prevent one person from having the event.\"\n\nThis explanation is grounded in the calculated aggregate data ($p_c = 0.20$, $p_t = 0.12$, $ARR = 0.08$, and $NNT = 12.5$), uses natural frequencies (\"X out of 100\"), makes no claims about any specific individual's outcome, and thus fulfills the ethical requirements of informed consent, confidentiality, and privacy.\n\nThe final answer requested is the numerical value of the $NNT$ rounded to three significant figures.\n$NNT = 12.5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12.5}$$", "id": "4966038"}, {"introduction": "A clinician's duty to maintain confidentiality extends beyond the examination room to the digital systems that store vast amounts of sensitive patient information. This problem [@problem_id:4966042] delves into the practical application of statistics in safeguarding patient privacy within modern Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems.

For each clinician-day, the system computes a $z$-score defined by $z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}$, where $x$ is the observed number of PHI accesses, and $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ are the baseline mean and standard deviation for that clinician under compliant behavior. The alerting rule is one-sided: an access pattern is flagged as anomalous if the standardized value exceeds $3$ (that is, when $Z > 3$), reflecting concern primarily about excessive access. Assume that under compliant behavior the standardized access measure $Z$ is approximately standard normal.\n\nStarting from the definitions of a $z$-score and the properties of the normal distribution, derive the false positive rate, understood as the probability that a compliant clinician-day is flagged by this rule. Then, propose a principled tuning strategy that maps a chosen upper-tail false positive budget $\\alpha$ to a $z$-score threshold that achieves that budget, and explain the reasoning from first principles.\n\nExpress the false positive rate as a decimal and round your answer to four significant figures. Do not use a percentage sign.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in standard statistical theory, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient information, and uses precise, objective language.\n\nThe problem asks for two derivations based on the provided information about an EHR audit system.\n\nFirst, we must derive the false positive rate of the current system. A false positive is defined as an event where a compliant clinician-day is flagged as anomalous. This corresponds to a Type I error in hypothesis testing, where the null hypothesis is that the clinician's behavior is compliant.\n\nThe problem states that for compliant behavior, the standardized access measure $Z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}$ is approximately standard normal. We denote this as $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. A standard normal distribution has a mean of $0$ and a standard deviation of $1$.\n\nThe alerting rule is that an access pattern is flagged if the standardized value $Z$ exceeds $3$. This defines the rejection region for our statistical test as $Z > 3$.\n\nThe false positive rate (FPR) is the probability that a compliant case is flagged. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$\n\\text{FPR} = P(Z > 3 | \\text{behavior is compliant})\n$$\nSince $Z$ follows a standard normal distribution under compliant behavior, we can calculate this probability directly from the properties of the standard normal distribution:\n$$\n\\text{FPR} = P(Z > 3) \\quad \\text{where } Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\n$$\nLet $\\Phi(z)$ be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, which gives the probability that a standard normal random variable is less than or equal to a value $z$:\n$$\n\\Phi(z) = P(Z \\le z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{z} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t^2}{2}\\right) dt\n$$\nThe probability $P(Z > 3)$ is the complement of $P(Z \\le 3)$. This area under the probability density curve is also known as the survival function or the complementary CDF, evaluated at $z=3$.\n$$\n\\text{FPR} = P(Z > 3) = 1 - P(Z \\le 3) = 1 - \\Phi(3)\n$$\nUsing standard statistical tables or computational software, the value of $\\Phi(3)$ is approximately $0.9986501$. Therefore, the false positive rate is:\n$$\n\\text{FPR} = 1 - 0.9986501 = 0.0013499\n$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant digit is $1$, followed by $3$, $4$, and $9$. The digit following the $9$ is $9$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up. This gives:\n$$\n\\text{FPR} \\approx 0.001350\n$$\nThe trailing zero is significant and must be included.\n\nSecond, we must propose a principled tuning strategy to set a $z$-score threshold that achieves a chosen upper-tail false positive budget, denoted by $\\alpha$.\nLet the new, tunable $z$-score threshold be denoted by $c$. The alerting rule is now $Z > c$. The false positive budget $\\alpha$ is the desired false positive rate. From first principles, this means we want to find the value of $c$ that satisfies the equation:\n$$\nP(Z > c) = \\alpha \\quad \\text{where } Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\n$$\nUsing the standard normal CDF, $\\Phi(z)$, we can rewrite the equation as:\n$$\n1 - \\Phi(c) = \\alpha\n$$\nSolving for $\\Phi(c)$, we get:\n$$\n\\Phi(c) = 1 - \\alpha\n$$\nTo find the threshold $c$, we must apply the inverse of the CDF. The inverse CDF, also known as the quantile function, is often denoted as $\\Phi^{-1}(p)$. It returns the value $z$ such that the cumulative probability is $p$. Applying this function to both sides of the equation yields the expression for the threshold $c$:\n$$\nc = \\Phi^{-1}(1 - \\alpha)\n$$\nThis is the principled tuning strategy. For any desired false positive budget $\\alpha$ (e.g., $\\alpha = 0.01$, $\\alpha = 0.005$), the system administrator can calculate the required $z$-score threshold $c$ by finding the value that leaves an area of $\\alpha$ in the upper tail of the standard normal distribution. This value $c$ is the $(1-\\alpha)$-quantile of the standard normal distribution. For example, if the desired false positive budget is $\\alpha = 0.01$, the threshold would be $c = \\Phi^{-1}(1 - 0.01) = \\Phi^{-1}(0.99) \\approx 2.326$. This strategy directly and quantitatively links the system's alerting threshold to its statistical performance in terms of false positives.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.001350}\n$$", "id": "4966042"}]}
