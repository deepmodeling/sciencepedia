The Aspartate Aminotransferase to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) is a widely used, well-tested composite derived from the ratio of Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) to its Upper Limit of Normal (ULN), scaled by the platelet count, to reflect the opposing biological effects of necroinflammation (which elevates $ \\text{AST} $) and portal hypertension from fibrosis (which lowers platelets).

Express the final numeric value without units.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, providing all necessary information for a complete solution. It is a valid exercise in applying a standard clinical scoring system.\n\nThe Aspartate Aminotransferase to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) is a noninvasive marker used to estimate the degree of liver fibrosis. Its calculation is based on a standardized formula that incorporates the patient's Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) level, the upper limit of normal (ULN) for AST at the specific laboratory, and the patient's platelet count.\n\nThe formula for the APRI score is defined as:\n$$\n\\text{APRI} = \\left[ \\frac{\\frac{\\text{AST (U/L)}}{\\text{ULN (U/L)}}}{\\text{Platelet count} \\, (10^9/\\text{L})} \\right] \\times 100\n$$\n\nThe provided laboratory values for the patient are:\n- Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST): $78 \\, \\text{U/L}$\n- Upper Limit of Normal for AST (ULN): $40 \\, \\text{U/L}$\n- Platelet count: $120 \\times 10^9/\\text{L}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the ratio of the patient's AST to the ULN. This is a dimensionless quantity representing the fold-increase of AST above the normal limit.\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{AST}}{\\text{ULN}} = \\frac{78}{40} = 1.95\n$$\n\nNext, we identify the platelet count in the required units of $10^9/\\text{L}$. The given value is $120 \\times 10^9/\\text{L}$, so the numerical value to be used in the denominator of the formula is $120$.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the APRI formula:\n$$\n\\text{APRI} = \\left[ \\frac{1.95}{120} \\right] \\times 100\n$$\n\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$\n\\text{APRI} = 0.01625 \\times 100 = 1.625\n$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final value to three significant figures. The calculated value is $1.625$. The fourth significant digit is $5$, so we round the third digit up.\n$$\n\\text{APRI} \\approx 1.63\n$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to interpret this result based on commonly used thresholds for chronic hepatitis C. The APRI score is typically interpreted using a two-cutoff system to either rule out or rule in advanced fibrosis.\n\n1.  **Interpretation for Significant Fibrosis (METAVIR stage $F \\ge 2$)**:\n    - A low cutoff, typically $APRI  0.5$, is used to *rule out* significant fibrosis with high sensitivity and high negative predictive value.\n    - A high cutoff, typically $APRI > 1.5$, is used to *rule in* significant fibrosis with high specificity and high positive predictive value.\n    The patient's score is $1.63$. Since $1.63 > 1.5$, this result is above the high cutoff and therefore tends to **rule in** the presence of significant hepatic fibrosis.\n\n2.  **Interpretation for Cirrhosis (METAVIR stage $F4$)**:\n    - A cutoff of $APRI > 1.0$ is sometimes used to suggest cirrhosis, though with moderate accuracy.\n    - A higher cutoff, typically $APRI > 2.0$, is used to *rule in* cirrhosis with very high specificity.\n    The patient's score of $1.63$ falls between these two common thresholds ($1.0  1.63  2.0$). It is in an intermediate or \"gray\" zone. It does not meet the high-specificity threshold to confidently rule in cirrhosis, but it is high enough to raise significant suspicion and certainly does not rule it out. Further investigation, such as with transient elastography (FibroScan) or liver biopsy, would be warranted.\n\nFinally, the sensitivity and specificity behavior of the APRI test is a function of the chosen threshold.\n- At **low thresholds** (e.g., $ 0.5$), the test is configured for high **sensitivity**. This means it will correctly identify a high proportion of individuals who truly have significant fibrosis. The goal here is to minimize false negatives, making it a good \"rule-out\" test. If a patient’s score is below this threshold, one can be reasonably confident they do not have significant fibrosis.\n- At **high thresholds** (e.g., $> 1.5$ or $> 2.0$), the test is configured for high **specificity**. This means it will correctly identify a high proportion of individuals who truly do not have significant fibrosis/cirrhosis. The goal here is to minimize false positives, making it a good \"rule-in\" test. If a patient’s score is above this threshold, one can be reasonably confident they do have the condition.\n\nScores falling between the low and high thresholds are considered indeterminate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.63}$$", "id": "4986494"}, {"introduction": "For patients with advanced cirrhosis, assessing short-term mortality risk is essential for guiding treatment intensity and prioritizing for liver transplantation. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is the standard tool for this purpose, integrating key measures of liver and kidney function into a powerful prognostic model.

The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is a well-validated tool for estimating short-term mortality risk and transplant urgency in advanced liver disease. The standard published form of this score uses the natural logarithm and combines the above three laboratory variables with fixed coefficients, and applies a clinical lower bound of $1.0$ to each input value prior to logarithmic transformation.\n\nUsing the standard MELD definition that employs the natural logarithm $\\ln$ and the coefficients associated with total bilirubin (mg/dL), INR, and serum creatinine (mg/dL), compute the MELD score for this patient. Then, based on widely used clinical categories, briefly interpret whether transplant priority is urgent and whether short-term mortality risk is low, intermediate, or high.

We first check the given values:\n-   Serum Creatinine ($\\text{Cr}$) = $1.6$ mg/dL. Since $1.6  1.0$, we use the value $1.6$.

This is associated with a high 3-month mortality risk (approaching or exceeding $50 \\%$ without a transplant). The mortality risk for this patient is high.\n-   **Transplant Priority**: In transplant allocation systems like the one used in the United States, a higher MELD score corresponds to a higher priority on the liver transplant waiting list.
