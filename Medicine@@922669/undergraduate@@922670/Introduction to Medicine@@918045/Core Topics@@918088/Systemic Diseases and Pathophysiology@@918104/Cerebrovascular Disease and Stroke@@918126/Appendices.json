In physiological terms, this is the Cerebral Perfusion Pressure ($CPP$). The upstream pressure is the Mean Arterial Pressure ($MAP$), and the downstream opposing pressure is the Intracranial Pressure ($ICP$). Therefore, the definition gives the following relationship:\n    $$CPP = MAP - ICP$$\n\n2.  **Fluid Dynamics of Laminar Flow:** The problem specifies the assumption of laminar flow in the cerebral resistance vessels. For laminar flow of a fluid through a rigid tube or a vascular bed, the relationship between the pressure drop across the system ($\\Delta P$), the volumetric flow rate ($Q$), and the hydraulic resistance ($R$) is analogous to Ohm's law in electrical circuits. This relationship is given by:\n    $$\\Delta P = Q \\times R$$\n\n3.  **Application to Cerebral Circulation:** We can apply this general fluid dynamics principle to the cerebral vascular bed.\n    *   The pressure drop, $\\Delta P$, is the driving pressure across the brain, which is the Cerebral Perfusion Pressure, $CPP$.\n    *   The volumetric flow rate, $Q$, is the Cerebral Blood Flow, $CBF$.\n    *   The hydraulic resistance, $R$, is the Cerebrovascular Resistance, $CVR$.\n\n    Substituting these specific terms into the general equation yields:\n    $$CPP = CBF \\times CVR$$\n\n4.  **Final Expression for $CBF$:** To find an expression for $CBF$ in terms of $MAP$, $ICP$, and $CVR$, we first substitute the definition of $CPP$ from step 1 into the equation from step 3:\n    $$MAP - ICP = CBF \\times CVR$$\n    Now, we can algebraically rearrange this equation to solve for $CBF$:\n    $$CBF = \\frac{MAP - ICP}{CVR}$$\n    This is the required expression. It states that cerebral blood flow is directly proportional to the cerebral perfusion pressure and inversely proportional to the cerebrovascular resistance.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Cerebral Blood Flow**\n\nThe second part of the problem asks to compute the numerical value of $CBF$ for a patient with specified physiological parameters.\n\n1.  **Given Values:**\n    *   Mean Arterial Pressure, $MAP = 90 \\text{ mmHg}$\n    *   Intracranial Pressure, $ICP = 10 \\text{ mmHg}$\n    *   Cerebrovascular Resistance, $CVR = 1.63 \\text{ mmHg} \\cdot \\text{min} \\cdot 100\\,\\text{g} / \\text{mL}$\n\n2.  **Calculate Cerebral Perfusion Pressure ($CPP$):**\n    Using the definition $CPP = MAP - ICP$, we substitute the given values:\n    $$CPP = 90 \\text{ mmHg} - 10 \\text{ mmHg} = 80 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n    Note that both $MAP$ and $ICP$ are given to the nearest integer, implying at least two significant figures. The result of the subtraction, $80 \\text{ mmHg}$, also has at least two significant figures.\n\n3.  **Calculate Cerebral Blood Flow ($CBF$):**\n    Using the derived formula $CBF = \\frac{CPP}{CVR}$, we substitute the calculated $CPP$ and the given $CVR$:\n    $$CBF = \\frac{80 \\text{ mmHg}}{1.63 \\frac{\\text{mmHg} \\cdot \\text{min} \\cdot 100\\,\\text{g}}{\\text{mL}}}$$\n    The numerical calculation is:\n    $$CBF = \\frac{80}{1.63} \\approx 49.0797546...$$\n\n4.  **Unit Analysis:** The units are handled as follows:\n    $$\\text{Units of } CBF = \\frac{\\text{mmHg}}{\\frac{\\text{mmHg} \\cdot \\text{min} \\cdot 100\\,\\text{g}}{\\text{mL}}} = \\text{mmHg} \\cdot \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{mmHg} \\cdot \\text{min} \\cdot 100\\,\\text{g}} = \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min} \\cdot 100\\,\\text{g}}$$\n    This is commonly written as $\\text{mL}/(100\\,\\text{g} \\cdot \\text{min})$ or, as requested by the problem, $\\text{mL} \\cdot (100\\,\\text{g})^{-1} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}$ or $\\text{mL} \\cdot 100^{-1}\\,\\text{g} \\cdot \\text{min}^{-1}$.\n\n5.  **Rounding:** The problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The value $80$ has at least two, and $1.63$ has three. Standard practice would suggest rounding to the least number of significant figures, which is three from $CVR$ (assuming $80$ is precise).

The calculation proceeds in several logical steps: determining the total dose, partitioning the dose into bolus and infusion components, and finally calculating the volumetric infusion rate.\n\nFirst, we determine the total dose of alteplase, $D_{\\text{total}}$. The protocol specifies a weight-based dose of $0.9$ mg/kg. The patient's body weight, $m$, is given as $78$ kg.\nThe calculated dose, $D_{\\text{calc}}$, is:\n$$D_{\\text{calc}} = 0.9 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}} \\times m = 0.9 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}} \\times 78 \\text{ kg} = 70.2 \\text{ mg}$$\nThe protocol also specifies a maximum total dose, $D_{\\text{max}}$, of $90$ mg. The actual total dose to be administered, $D_{\\text{total}}$, is the lesser of the calculated dose and the maximum dose.\n$$D_{\\text{total}} = \\min(D_{\\text{calc}}, D_{\\text{max}}) = \\min(70.2 \\text{ mg}, 90 \\text{ mg}) = 70.2 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nNext, we partition this total dose into the initial bolus and the subsequent infusion.\nThe bolus dose, $D_{\\text{bolus}}$, is $10\\%$ of the total dose:\n$$D_{\\text{bolus}} = 0.10 \\times D_{\\text{total}} = 0.10 \\times 70.2 \\text{ mg} = 7.02 \\text{ mg}$$\nThe infusion dose, $D_{\\text{infusion}}$, is the remaining $90\\%$ of the total dose:\n$$D_{\\text{infusion}} = 0.90 \\times D_{\\text{total}} = 0.90 \\times 70.2 \\text{ mg} = 63.18 \\text{ mg}$$\nAs a check, $D_{\\text{bolus}} + D_{\\text{infusion}} = 7.02\\,\\text{mg} + 63.18\\,\\text{mg} = 70.2\\,\\text{mg}$, which equals $D_{\\text{total}}$.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the infusion pump rate in mL/h. The infusion dose, $D_{\\text{infusion}}$, is $63.18$ mg. The alteplase is supplied at a concentration, $C$, of $1$ mg/mL. The relationship between mass ($D$), concentration ($C$), and volume ($V$) is $D = C \\times V$. We can find the volume of the solution to be infused, $V_{\\text{infusion}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{infusion}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{infusion}}}{C} = \\frac{63.18 \\text{ mg}}{1 \\text{ mg/mL}} = 63.18 \\text{ mL}$$\nThis volume is to be infused over a time period, $T_{\\text{infusion}}$, of $60$ minutes. The infusion rate, $R$, is the volume per unit time. We are asked for the rate in units of mL/h.\nSince $60$ minutes is equal to $1$ hour ($1$ h), the calculation is direct:\n$$R = \\frac{V_{\\text{infusion}}}{T_{\\text{infusion}}} = \\frac{63.18 \\text{ mL}}{60 \\text{ min}} = \\frac{63.18 \\text{ mL}}{1 \\text{ h}} = 63.18 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{h}}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value, $63.18$, already has four significant figures.\n\nIn addition to the calculation, a strict monitoring plan is essential to manage the primary risk of alteplase therapy, which is hemorrhage, particularly intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The plan must include:\n1.  **Hemodynamic Surveillance**: Frequent monitoring of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate is critical. A typical protocol is every $15$ minutes for the first $2$ hours, then every $30$ minutes for the next $6$ hours, and hourly for the subsequent $16$ hours. BP must be rigorously maintained below a specified threshold, often $180/105\\,\\text{mmHg}$, using antihypertensive agents as needed, to minimize the risk of hemorrhagic transformation of the infarct.\n2.  **Neurologic Surveillance**: Neurologic assessments, often using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), must be performed with the same frequency as hemodynamic monitoring. Any neurologic worsening, such as an increase in the NIHSS score, decreased level of consciousness, new severe headache, or acute nausea/vomiting, must prompt immediate cessation of the alteplase infusion and an emergent non-contrast head CT scan to rule out ICH.\n3.  **Bleeding Precautions**: General precautions to minimize bleeding risk must be instituted. This includes avoiding antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin) and anticoagulants (e.g., heparin) for at least $24$ hours post-tPA. Invasive procedures, such as the placement of nasogastric tubes or indwelling urinary catheters, should be avoided if possible. The patient must be monitored for any signs of systemic bleeding (e.g., hematuria, gum bleeding, ecchymosis).\n4.  **Scheduled Imaging and Laboratory Tests**: A routine follow-up non-contrast head CT or MRI is mandatory at $24$ hours after alteplase administration. This is performed to rule out asymptomatic ICH before initiating secondary stroke prevention agents like antiplatelets. While baseline coagulation studies (PT/INR, aPTT) and a complete blood count are required before tPA is given, they are not routinely repeated unless there is a clinical suspicion of a coagulopathy or active bleeding.\n\nThe numerical answer for the infusion pump rate is derived from the calculations above.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{63.18}$$", "id": "4951492"}, {"introduction": "The management of cerebrovascular disease often involves a delicate balance between preventing clots and causing bleeding.
