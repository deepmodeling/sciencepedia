It presents a standard, albeit simplified, biomechanical model of stress in an atherosclerotic plaque cap, which is a fundamental concept in the study of cardiovascular disease pathophysiology. The assumptions provided—thin-wall approximation, spherical geometry, membrane behavior—are classic idealizations used in continuum mechanics to derive a first-order analytical solution. The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information for the derivation and subsequent calculation. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the average circumferential (hoop) stress $\\,\\sigma\\,$ in a thin spherical membrane and its application to a clinical scenario.\n\nWe begin by applying the first principles of mechanical equilibrium. Consider the atherosclerotic plaque cap to be a thin-walled spherical shell of local lumen radius $\\,r\\,$ and uniform thickness $\\,t\\,$, where $\\,t \\ll r\\,$ (the thin-wall approximation). The cap is subjected to a uniform internal blood pressure $\\,P\\,$. To find the hoop stress $\\,\\sigma\\,$, we imagine conceptually cutting the spherical cap into two hemispheres.\n\nThe force exerted by the internal pressure $\\,P\\,$ on the internal circular area exposed by the cut is directed along the axis of symmetry. The area of this circle is $\\,A_{pressure} = \\pi r^2\\,$. The total bursting force, $\\,F_P\\,$, is the pressure multiplied by this area:\n$$F_P = P \\cdot A_{pressure} = P \\pi r^2$$\n\nThis bursting force must be balanced by the resisting force developed within the material of the cap wall at the cut. This resisting force, $\\,F_\\sigma\\,$, arises from the hoop stress $\\,\\sigma\\,$ acting on the cross-sectional area of the wall material. The cross-sectional area of this thin ring is approximately its circumference multiplied by its thickness:\n$$A_{wall} = (2\\pi r) \\cdot t$$\nThe resisting force is then the stress multiplied by this area:\n$$F_\\sigma = \\sigma \\cdot A_{wall} = \\sigma (2 \\pi r t)$$\n\nFor the cap to be in mechanical equilibrium, the bursting force must be equal to the resisting force:\n$$F_P = F_\\sigma$$\n$$P \\pi r^2 = \\sigma (2 \\pi r t)$$\n\nWe can now solve for the hoop stress $\\,\\sigma\\,$:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{P \\pi r^2}{2 \\pi r t}$$\nCanceling common terms ($\\,\\pi\\,$ and one factor of $\\,r\\,$), we arrive at the governing equation, which is a form of the Law of Laplace for a spherical vessel:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{Pr}{2t}$$\nThis equation shows that the hoop stress $\\,\\sigma\\,$ is directly proportional to the pressure $\\,P\\,$ and the radius $\\,r\\,$, and inversely proportional to the cap thickness $\\,t\\,$.\n\nNext, we compute the fold-change in stress when the cap thickness decreases. Let the initial state be denoted by subscript $\\,1\\,$ and the final state by subscript $\\,2\\,$. The problem states that the intraluminal pressure $\\,P\\,$ and the local lumen radius $\\,r\\,$ remain fixed.\nThe initial stress, $\\,\\sigma_1\\,$, with thickness $\\,t_1 = 0.10\\,\\text{mm}\\,$ is:\n$$\\sigma_1 = \\frac{Pr}{2t_1}$$\nThe final stress, $\\,\\sigma_2\\,$, with thickness $\\,t_2 = 0.06\\,\\text{mm}\\,$ is:\n$$\\sigma_2 = \\frac{Pr}{2t_2}$$\n\nThe fold-change in stress is the ratio $\\,\\frac{\\sigma_2}{\\sigma_1}\\,$:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_2}{\\sigma_1} = \\frac{\\frac{Pr}{2t_2}}{\\frac{Pr}{2t_1}}$$\nThe terms $\\,P\\,$, $\\,r\\,$, and $\\,2\\,$ cancel out, leaving a simple ratio of the thicknesses:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_2}{\\sigma_1} = \\frac{t_1}{t_2}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_2}{\\sigma_1} = \\frac{0.10\\,\\text{mm}}{0.06\\,\\text{mm}} = \\frac{0.10}{0.06}$$\nTo express this as an exact fraction, we can write the decimals as fractions or multiply the numerator and denominator by $\\,100\\,$:\n$$\\frac{0.10}{0.06} = \\frac{10}{6} = \\frac{5}{3}$$\nThus, the stress increases by a factor of $\\,\\frac{5}{3}\\,$.\n\nFinally, we interpret this result in the context of mechanical vulnerability. The derived relationship $\\,\\sigma = \\frac{Pr}{2t}\\,$ clearly shows that stress $\\,\\sigma\\,$ is inversely proportional to thickness $\\,t\\,$. Therefore, as the cap thickness $\\,t\\,$ decreases, the circumferential stress $\\,\\sigma\\,$ experienced by the fibrous cap material increases, assuming pressure and radius are constant. Mechanical failure, or rupture, of a material occurs when the stress acting upon it exceeds its ultimate tensile strength. By increasing the stress in the cap, the thinning process brings the cap closer to this failure point. Consequently, a decrease in cap thickness markedly increases the plaque's mechanical vulnerability to rupture. This biomechanical principle is a cornerstone of understanding why thin-cap fibroatheromas are considered high-risk, \"vulnerable\" plaques prone to causing acute coronary events like myocardial infarction.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{5}{3}} $$", "id": "4946572"}, {"introduction": "The core problem in ischemic heart disease is an imbalance between the heart's metabolic demand and the coronary arteries' ability to supply oxygenated blood.

The data are consistent and sufficient for a solution.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information. A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe core principle is the conservation of mass for oxygen across the myocardial control volume. The problem states we can assume steady state, meaning there is no accumulation or depletion of oxygen within the tissue over time. Therefore, the rate at which oxygen enters the control volume must equal the rate at which it leaves, plus the rate at which it is consumed by the myocardial tissue.\n\nLet $\\dot{V}_{O2,in}$ be the volumetric flow rate of oxygen entering the myocardium via the coronary arteries.\nLet $\\dot{V}_{O2,out}$ be the volumetric flow rate of oxygen leaving the myocardium via the coronary sinus.\nLet $VO_2$ be the volumetric rate of oxygen consumption by the myocardium (also referred to as myocardial oxygen uptake).\n\nThe conservation of mass, expressed in terms of oxygen volume per unit time, is:\n$$ \\dot{V}_{O2,in} = \\dot{V}_{O2,out} + VO_2 $$\n\nThe rate of oxygen delivery or removal is the product of the blood flow rate and the oxygen concentration in the blood.\nThe rate of oxygen entering is given by the total coronary blood flow $Q$ multiplied by the arterial oxygen content $C_{aO2}$:\n$$ \\dot{V}_{O2,in} = Q \\times C_{aO2} $$\n\nSimilarly, the rate of oxygen leaving is given by the same blood flow $Q$ multiplied by the venous oxygen content $C_{vO2}$:\n$$ \\dot{V}_{O2,out} = Q \\times C_{vO2} $$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the conservation equation:\n$$ Q \\times C_{aO2} = Q \\times C_{vO2} + VO_2 $$\n\nWe are asked to solve for the myocardial oxygen consumption, $VO_2$. Rearranging the equation gives the desired expression, which is an application of the Fick principle:\n$$ VO_2 = Q \\times C_{aO2} - Q \\times C_{vO2} $$\n$$ VO_2 = Q \\times (C_{aO2} - C_{vO2}) $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values to calculate the final answer.\nGiven data:\n- $Q = 250$ ml/min\n- $C_{aO2} = 18$ ml O$_2$/dl\n- $C_{vO2} = 6$ ml O$_2$/dl\n\nFirst, calculate the arteriovenous oxygen difference:\n$$ C_{aO2} - C_{vO2} = 18 \\frac{\\text{ml O}_2}{\\text{dl}} - 6 \\frac{\\text{ml O}_2}{\\text{dl}} = 12 \\frac{\\text{ml O}_2}{\\text{dl}} $$\n\nNow substitute this difference and the flow rate $Q$ into the derived equation for $VO_2$:\n$$ VO_2 = \\left(250 \\frac{\\text{ml blood}}{\\text{min}}\\right) \\times \\left(12 \\frac{\\text{ml O}_2}{\\text{dl blood}}\\right) $$\n\nTo ensure dimensional consistency, we must convert the units.

The blood flow through the myocardium, $Q_N$, is driven by the pressure gradient from the aorta to the venous circulation, $P_a - P_v$. The resistance is entirely due to the dilated microvasculature, $R_{\\mu}$, as the resistance of a healthy epicardial artery is negligible.\n$$ Q_N = \\frac{P_a - P_v}{R_{\\mu}} $$\n\nNext, we consider the artery with the stenosis present, again during maximal hyperemia. The total flow to the same myocardial bed is $Q_S$. While the overall driving pressure across the entire system remains $P_a - P_v$, the flow $Q_S$ can also be described by considering the pressure gradient across the microvasculature alone. The pressure just distal to the stenosis is $P_d$. Therefore, the flow through the microvasculature is driven by the pressure difference $P_d - P_v$. Since the resistance of the microvasculature is assumed to be the same $R_{\\mu}$ as in the normal case, we can write:\n$$ Q_S = \\frac{P_d - P_v}{R_{\\mu}} $$\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions for $Q_N$ and $Q_S$ into the definition of FFR:\n$$ \\text{FFR} = \\frac{Q_S}{Q_N} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{P_d - P_v}{R_{\\mu}} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{P_a - P_v}{R_{\\mu}} \\right)} $$\nThe microvascular resistance term, $R_{\\mu}$, which is difficult to measure directly, conveniently cancels out:\n$$ \\text{FFR} = \\frac{P_d - P_v}{P_a - P_v} $$\n\nThe problem statement provides a further simplifying assumption: \"the venous (right atrial) pressure is small compared with the aortic pressure and may be neglected to first approximation.\" This implies that we can set $P_v \\approx 0$ in our derived expression.
