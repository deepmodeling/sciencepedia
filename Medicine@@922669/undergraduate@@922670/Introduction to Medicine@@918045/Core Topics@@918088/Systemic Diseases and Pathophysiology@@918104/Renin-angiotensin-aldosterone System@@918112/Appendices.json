This first practice problem explores a hypothetical scenario where the very first step is blocked due to the absence of the substrate angiotensinogen [@problem_id:1752870]. By analyzing the hormonal response to dehydration in this context, you will dissect the core pathway of the RAAS and learn to differentiate its function from that of the independent antidiuretic hormone (ADH) system.", "problem": "A patient is diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder that results in the complete absence of circulating angiotensinogen, a prohormone synthesized by the liver. This patient experiences an episode of severe dehydration, leading to a significant drop in both blood volume (hypovolemia) and blood pressure (hypotension). Which of the following combinations of plasma hormone levels would be expected in this patient as a compensatory response to this condition?\n\nA. High renin, low aldosterone, high antidiuretic hormone (ADH)\n\nB. Low renin, low aldosterone, low ADH\n\nC. High renin, high aldosterone, high ADH\n\nD. Low renin, high aldosterone, high ADH\n\nE. High renin, high aldosterone, low ADH", "solution": "To determine the correct combination of hormone levels, we must analyze the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) and other related blood pressure regulatory mechanisms in the context of the patient's specific genetic defect and physiological stress.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial stimulus.**\nThe patient is experiencing severe dehydration, which leads to hypovolemia (low blood volume) and hypotension (low blood pressure). These conditions are potent stimuli for the body's compensatory mechanisms aimed at restoring blood volume and pressure. Additionally, dehydration leads to an increase in the concentration of solutes in the blood, known as increased plasma osmolality.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the impact of absent angiotensinogen.**\nThe RAAS cascade begins when renin, an enzyme from the kidneys, cleaves angiotensinogen (from the liver) to form angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is then converted to angiotensin II by Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II is the primary active hormone of this system.\nIn this patient, angiotensinogen is completely absent. Therefore, even if renin is present, it has no substrate to act upon. This means that no angiotensin I can be formed, and consequently, no angiotensin II can be produced via this pathway. The entire RAAS cascade downstream of angiotensinogen is non-functional.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the expected level of renin.**\nRenin is secreted by the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney in response to three main stimuli:\n1.  Decreased arterial pressure (sensed by baroreceptors in the afferent arteriole).\n2.  Decreased sodium chloride delivery to the macula densa.\n3.  Increased sympathetic nervous system activity.\nThe patient's hypotension directly activates the first stimulus. Therefore, the kidneys will be strongly stimulated to secrete renin. In a healthy individual, the resulting increase in angiotensin II would exert negative feedback on renin release. In this patient, since angiotensin II cannot be produced, this negative feedback loop is absent. The lack of negative feedback, combined with the strong stimulus of hypotension, will lead to very **high** plasma renin levels.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the expected level of aldosterone.**\nAldosterone is a mineralocorticoid hormone secreted by the adrenal cortex. Its primary function is to increase sodium and water reabsorption in the kidneys. The most potent stimulus for aldosterone secretion is angiotensin II. Other weaker stimuli include high plasma potassium levels (hyperkalemia) and Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH).\nIn the patient, angiotensin II is absent. Therefore, the main pathway for stimulating aldosterone in response to hypotension is broken. While other factors might slightly influence aldosterone, the lack of its primary stimulus means that aldosterone secretion will not increase significantly in response to the hypovolemia and hypotension. Thus, its level will be inappropriately **low** for the physiological state.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the expected level of antidiuretic hormone (ADH).**\nAntidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, is released from the posterior pituitary gland. Its release is primarily controlled by two independent stimuli:\n1.  Increased plasma osmolality (sensed by hypothalamic osmoreceptors).\n2.  A large decrease in blood volume or pressure (sensed by baroreceptors).\nThe patient's severe dehydration causes a significant increase in plasma osmolality, which is a powerful stimulus for ADH release. The hypotension also contributes to this stimulus. This regulatory pathway is entirely separate from the RAAS. Therefore, despite the defect in the RAAS, the patient's body will still mount a robust ADH response to the dehydration and hypotension. The plasma ADH level will be **high**.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude and select the correct option.**\nBased on the analysis:\n- Renin will be **high** due to the direct stimulus of hypotension and the absence of negative feedback.\n- Aldosterone will be **low** due to the absence of its main stimulus, angiotensin II.\n- ADH will be **high** due to the independent stimulus of increased plasma osmolality and hypotension.\n\nThis combination corresponds to \"High renin, low aldosterone, high ADH\".

Renin levels will be elevated because high aldosterone directly stimulates the juxtaglomerular cells in the kidneys to increase renin production in a positive feedback loop.\n\nB. Renin levels will be suppressed because the high aldosterone-induced sodium and water retention leads to an increased blood volume and blood pressure, which inhibits renin release.\n\nC. Renin levels will be elevated because the low potassium levels (hypokalemia) are the primary stimulus for renin secretion, overriding all other signals.\n\nD. Renin levels will be unaffected because the tumor's aldosterone secretion is independent of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), so the rest of the system does not respond.\n\nE.

All necessary information and a clear, albeit simplified, mathematical model are provided. The physiological context and numerical values are realistic. We can proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Formalize the Model and Solve for New Steady State\n\nLet the initial state variables be denoted with a subscript $0$ and the new steady-state variables after $6$ hours be denoted with a subscript $1$.\n\n**Given Values:**\n- Initial Plasma Renin Activity: $PRA_0 = 2.5$ $\\text{ng}\\cdot\\text{mL}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{h}^{-1}$\n- Initial plasma aldosterone: $Aldo_0 = 10$ $\\text{ng}\\cdot\\text{dL}^{-1}$\n- ACE activity reduction: The new activity, $ACE_1$, is $100\\% - 60\\% = 40\\%$ of the original activity, $ACE_0$. Thus, $ACE_1 = 0.4 \\cdot ACE_0$.\n- Negative feedback gain: $g = 0.5$\n\n**Model Equations based on the provided principles:**\n1.  Plasma angiotensin II concentration, $[ \\text{AngII} ]$, is proportional to the product of ACE activity and PRA:\n    $$[ \\text{AngII} ] = k_1 \\cdot (ACE) \\cdot (PRA)$$\n    where $k_1$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\n2.  Plasma aldosterone concentration, $Aldo$, is proportional to $[ \\text{AngII} ]$:\n    $$Aldo = k_2 \\cdot [ \\text{AngII} ]$$\n    where $k_2$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\n3.  The negative feedback loop is described by:\n    $$\\dfrac{\\Delta PRA}{PRA_0} = - g \\cdot \\dfrac{\\Delta[ \\text{AngII} ]}{[ \\text{AngII} ]_0}$$\n    which can be written as:\n    $$\\dfrac{PRA_1 - PRA_0}{PRA_0} = - g \\cdot \\left( \\dfrac{[ \\text{AngII} ]_1 - [ \\text{AngII} ]_0}{[ \\text{AngII} ]_0} \\right)$$\n\nTo solve the system, we work with ratios of the new values to the old values. Let's define the following ratios:\n-   $x = \\dfrac{PRA_1}{PRA_0}$\n-   $y = \\dfrac{[ \\text{AngII} ]_1}{[ \\text{AngII} ]_0}$\n-   $z = \\dfrac{Aldo_1}{Aldo_0}$\n\nFrom equation (1), we can write the ratio of $[ \\text{AngII} ]$ concentrations:\n$$y = \\dfrac{[ \\text{AngII} ]_1}{[ \\text{AngII} ]_0} = \\dfrac{k_1 \\cdot ACE_1 \\cdot PRA_1}{k_1 \\cdot ACE_0 \\cdot PRA_0} = \\left(\\dfrac{ACE_1}{ACE_0}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{PRA_1}{PRA_0}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the given values, $\\dfrac{ACE_1}{ACE_0} = 0.4$ and $\\dfrac{PRA_1}{PRA_0} = x$:\n$$y = 0.4 \\cdot x \\quad (\\text{Eq. I})$$\n\nFrom equation (3), we can rewrite the feedback rule in terms of our ratios:\n$$\\dfrac{PRA_1}{PRA_0} - 1 = - g \\cdot \\left( \\dfrac{[ \\text{AngII} ]_1}{[ \\text{AngII} ]_0} - 1 \\right)$$\n$$x - 1 = -g \\cdot (y - 1)$$\nSubstituting $g=0.5$:\n$$x - 1 = -0.5 \\cdot (y - 1) \\quad (\\text{Eq. II})$$\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations (I and II) with two unknowns ($x$ and $y$). We can solve for $x$ and $y$ by substituting (I) into (II):\n$$x - 1 = -0.5 \\cdot (0.4x - 1)$$\n$$x - 1 = -0.2x + 0.5$$\n$$x + 0.2x = 1 + 0.5$$\n$$1.2x = 1.5$$\n$$x = \\dfrac{1.5}{1.2} = \\dfrac{15}{12} = \\dfrac{5}{4} = 1.25$$\n\nThis means the PRA increases by $25\\%$. We can now calculate the new PRA value:\n$$PRA_1 = x \\cdot PRA_0 = 1.25 \\cdot (2.5 \\text{ ng}\\cdot\\text{mL}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{h}^{-1}) = 3.125 \\text{ ng}\\cdot\\text{mL}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{h}^{-1}$$\n\nNext, we find the change in $[ \\text{AngII} ]$ using Eq. I:\n$$y = 0.4 \\cdot x = 0.4 \\cdot 1.25 = 0.5$$\nThis means the $[ \\text{AngII} ]$ concentration drops to $50\\%$ of its baseline value.\n\nFinally, we determine the new aldosterone level. From equation (2), the ratio of aldosterone levels is:\n$$z = \\dfrac{Aldo_1}{Aldo_0} = \\dfrac{k_2 \\cdot [ \\text{AngII} ]_1}{k_2 \\cdot [ \\text{AngII} ]_0} = \\dfrac{[ \\text{AngII} ]_1}{[ \\text{AngII} ]_0} = y$$\nSo, $z = 0.5$. The new aldosterone concentration is:\n$$Aldo_1 = z \\cdot Aldo_0 = 0.5 \\cdot (10 \\text{ ng}\\cdot\\text{dL}^{-1}) = 5.0 \\text{ ng}\\cdot\\text{dL}^{-1}$$\n\nOur calculated new steady-state values are $PRA_1 = 3.125$ $\\text{ng}\\cdot\\text{mL}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{h}^{-1}$ and $Aldo_1 = 5.0$ $\\text{ng}\\cdot\\text{dL}^{-1}$.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Option\n\n**A. $PRA$ increases from $2.5$ to $3.25$ $\\text{ng}\\cdot\\text{mL}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{h}^{-1}$; aldosterone decreases from $10$ to $5.2$ $\\text{ng}\\cdot\\text{dL}^{-1}$. Mechanism: reduced $[ \\text{AngII} ]$ removes negative feedback on renin release, increasing $PRA$; decreased $[ \\text{AngII} ]$ lessens zona glomerulosa stimulation, lowering aldosterone.**\n\n- **Numerical Values:** The values provided ($PRA_1 = 3.25$, $Aldo_1 = 5.2$) are very close to our calculated values ($PRA_1 = 3.125$, $Aldo_1 = 5.0$). The directions of change (PRA increases, aldosterone decreases) are correct. The minor numerical discrepancy likely arises from rounding in the problem's design, as the values $3.25$ and $5.2$ are internally consistent (a PRA of $3.25$ implies a PRA ratio $x = 3.25/2.5=1.3$, which gives an AngII ratio $y = 0.4 \\times 1.3 = 0.52$, leading to an aldosterone level of $0.52 \\times 10 = 5.2$). This pair of values nearly satisfies the feedback equation ($1.3 - 1 = -0.5(0.52-1) \\implies 0.3 = 0.24$, which is a close approximation).\n- **Mechanism:** The explanation is entirely correct. ACE inhibition lowers $[ \\text{AngII} ]$. This reduction in $[ \\text{AngII} ]$ has two key effects: (1) it reduces the stimulation of the adrenal zona glomerulosa, decreasing aldosterone secretion, and (2) it reduces the negative feedback on the juxtaglomerular cells, leading to an increase in renin secretion (and thus PRA).\n- **Verdict:** Correct. This option provides values that are numerically very close to the calculated result and presents a perfectly accurate physiological explanation.\n\n**B. $PRA$ decreases to $1.0$ $\\text{ng}\\cdot\\text{mL}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{h}^{-1}$; aldosterone increases to $15$ $\\text{ng}\\cdot\\text{dL}^{-1}$. Mechanism: ACE inhibition elevates bradykinin, which raises $[ \\text{AngII} ]$ and aldosterone.**\n\n- **Numerical Values:** The directions of change are incorrect. PRA is known to increase, not decrease, and aldosterone to decrease, not increase, with ACE inhibition.\n- **Mechanism:** The mechanism is physiologically incorrect. While ACE inhibitors do increase bradykinin, bradykinin does not raise $[ \\text{AngII} ]$ or aldosterone. This statement misrepresents the role of bradykinin.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. $PRA$ increases to $4.0$ $\\text{ng}\\cdot\\text{mL}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{h}^{-1}$; aldosterone remains $10$ $\\text{ng}\\cdot\\text{dL}^{-1}$. Mechanism: renin fully compensates to maintain $[ \\text{AngII} ]$, leaving aldosterone unchanged.**\n\n- **Numerical Values:** The values are inconsistent with the model. If aldosterone were unchanged, $[ \\text{AngII} ]$ would have to be unchanged. For $[ \\text{AngII} ]$ to remain constant despite a $60\\%$ drop in ACE activity, PRA would need to increase by a factor of $1/0.4 = 2.5$. The new PRA would be $2.5 \\times 2.5 = 6.25$, not $4.0$.\n- **Mechanism:** The concept of \"full compensation\" is flawed. According to the provided feedback model, a change in PRA is driven by a change in $[ \\text{AngII} ]$. If $[ \\text{AngII} ]$ did not change, there would be no signal to increase PRA. Thus, full compensation is impossible within this model.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. $PRA$ unchanged at $2.5$ $\\text{ng}\\cdot\\text{mL}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{h}^{-1}$; aldosterone decreases to $8.0$ $\\text{ng}\\cdot\\text{dL}^{-1}$ due to direct adrenal ACE inhibition independent of $[ \\text{AngII} ]$.**\n\n- **Numerical Values:** If PRA were unchanged, the drop in ACE activity would cause $[ \\text{AngII} ]$ to fall to $40\\%$ of baseline. This would cause aldosterone to fall to $0.4 \\times 10 = 4.0$ $\\text{ng}\\cdot\\text{dL}^{-1}$, not $8.0$.\n- **Mechanism:** The premise of unchanged PRA is incorrect. A drop in $[ \\text{AngII} ]$ (which must occur if PRA is constant and ACE is inhibited) would disinhibit renin release, causing PRA to rise. The mechanism also introduces a concept \"direct adrenal ACE inhibition independent of $[ \\text{AngII} ]$\" which is not part of the specified model.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. $PRA$ increases to $3.25$ $\\text{ng}\\cdot\\text{mL}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{h}^{-1}$; aldosterone increases to $12$ $\\text{ng}\\cdot\\text{dL}^{-1}$ because higher renin drives $[ \\text{AngII} ]$ up despite ACE inhibition.**\n\n- **Numerical Values:** Aldosterone increases, which is the opposite of the known effect of ACE inhibitors and contradicts our calculation.\n- **Mechanism:** The logic is flawed. The increase in renin is a partial compensation for the drop in $[ \\text{AngII} ]$, but it is not sufficient to raise $[ \\text{AngII} ]$ above baseline. Our calculation shows that the final $[ \\text{AngII} ]$ level is $50\\%$ of the initial level. Therefore, aldosterone must decrease.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option A is the only choice that reflects the correct physiological changes and provides numerical values that are consistent with the provided model, despite a minor imprecision.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4979077"}]}
