It is a classic compartmental analysis problem based on the conservation of mass.\n\n### Step 1: Derivation of the Governing Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)\n\nThe problem asks to model the time course of serum creatinine concentration, $Scr(t)$, within a single, well-mixed compartment of volume $V$, representing the extracellular fluid. The core principle is the conservation of mass. The total mass of creatinine in the compartment, $M(t)$, is given by the product of its concentration and the compartment volume:\n$$M(t) = V \\cdot Scr(t)$$\nwhere $M(t)$ is in $\\mathrm{mg}$, $V$ is in $\\mathrm{dL}$, and $Scr(t)$ is in $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n\nThe principle of mass conservation for the creatinine in the compartment is expressed as a mass balance equation:\n$$\\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = \\text{Rate of mass in} - \\text{Rate of mass out}$$\nThe problem states that creatinine is generated at a constant rate $G$ (in $\\mathrm{mg/day}$), which is the input term. The output term is the rate of elimination, which occurs via renal clearance. This rate is the product of the clearance, $Cl(t)$, and the concentration, $Scr(t)$.\n$$\\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = G - Cl(t) \\cdot Scr(t)$$\nSubstituting $M(t) = V \\cdot Scr(t)$ into the mass balance equation, and noting that the volume $V$ is constant, we get:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}(V \\cdot Scr(t)) = V \\frac{d(Scr(t))}{dt} = G - Cl(t) \\cdot Scr(t)$$\nThe problem defines renal clearance, $Cl(t)$, as being proportional to the Glomerular Filtration Rate, $GFR(t)$. The relationship is given by $Cl(t) = \\alpha \\cdot GFR(t)$, where $\\alpha = 14.4$ is a conversion factor to ensure dimensional consistency. With $GFR(t)$ in $\\mathrm{mL/min}$ and $Cl(t)$ in $\\mathrm{dL/day}$, the conversion is:\n$$1 \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{min}} = 1 \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{min}} \\times \\frac{1440 \\mathrm{min}}{1 \\mathrm{day}} \\times \\frac{1 \\mathrm{dL}}{100 \\mathrm{mL}} = 14.4 \\frac{\\mathrm{dL}}{\\mathrm{day}}$$\nThus, the given $\\alpha = 14.4$ is correct.\n\nSubstituting $Cl(t) = \\alpha \\cdot GFR(t)$ into the equation:\n$$V \\frac{d(Scr(t))}{dt} = G - (\\alpha \\cdot GFR(t)) \\cdot Scr(t)$$\nTo express this in the standard form of a first-order linear ODE, we divide by $V$:\n$$\\frac{d(Scr(t))}{dt} = \\frac{G}{V} - \\frac{\\alpha \\cdot GFR(t)}{V} Scr(t)$$\nRearranging terms, we obtain the governing differential equation for $Scr(t)$:\n$$\\frac{d(Scr(t))}{dt} + \\frac{\\alpha \\cdot GFR(t)}{V} Scr(t) = \\frac{G}{V}$$\nThe problem asks to identify the parameter $k$ as a function of $GFR(t)$ and $V$. This corresponds to the coefficient of the $Scr(t)$ term.\n$$k(t) = \\frac{\\alpha \\cdot GFR(t)}{V}$$\nThe units of $k(t)$ are $(\\mathrm{dL/day})/(\\mathrm{dL}) = \\mathrm{day}^{-1}$, which is appropriate for a rate constant.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Initial Condition\n\nThe system is at steady state for $t < 0$ with a baseline Glomerular Filtration Rate, $GFR_0$. At steady state, the concentration is constant, so $\\frac{d(Scr)}{dt} = 0$. The ODE simplifies to:\n$$0 + \\frac{\\alpha \\cdot GFR_0}{V} Scr_{ss} = \\frac{G}{V}$$\nwhere $Scr_{ss}$ is the steady-state concentration. Solving for $Scr_{ss}$:\n$$\\alpha \\cdot GFR_0 \\cdot Scr_{ss} = G$$\n$$Scr_{ss} = \\frac{G}{\\alpha \\cdot GFR_0}$$\nThe acute kidney injury occurs at $t = 0$. Since the concentration of creatinine in the fluid compartment cannot change instantaneously, the concentration at $t=0$ is equal to the steady-state concentration for $t<0$. Thus, the initial condition is:\n$$Scr(0) = Scr_{ss} = \\frac{G}{\\alpha \\cdot GFR_0}$$\n\n### Step 3: Solution of the ODE for $t \\ge 0$\n\nFor $t \\ge 0$, an acute kidney injury event occurs, causing the GFR to drop by $50\\%$. The new GFR is constant for $t \\ge 0$:\n$$GFR(t) = GFR_{AKI} = 0.5 \\cdot GFR_0$$\nThe governing ODE for $t \\ge 0$ is therefore a linear first-order ODE with constant coefficients:\n$$\\frac{d(Scr(t))}{dt} + \\left(\\frac{\\alpha \\cdot GFR_{AKI}}{V}\\right) Scr(t) = \\frac{G}{V}$$\nLet the constant rate coefficient be $k_{AKI} = \\frac{\\alpha \\cdot GFR_{AKI}}{V} = \\frac{0.5 \\cdot \\alpha \\cdot GFR_0}{V}$. The equation takes the form $\\frac{dy}{dt} + k y = c$, where $y(t) = Scr(t)$, $k = k_{AKI}$, and $c = G/V$.\nThe general solution to this type of ODE is:\n$$y(t) = y_{final\\_ss} + (y(0) - y_{final\\_ss}) e^{-kt}$$\nwhere $y_{final\\_ss}$ is the new steady-state concentration as $t \\to \\infty$, which is $c/k$.\nLet's find the new steady-state concentration, $Scr_{final\\_ss}$:\n$$Scr_{final\\_ss} = \\frac{G/V}{k_{AKI}} = \\frac{G/V}{(\\alpha \\cdot GFR_{AKI})/V} = \\frac{G}{\\alpha \\cdot GFR_{AKI}} = \\frac{G}{\\alpha \\cdot (0.5 \\cdot GFR_0)} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{G}{\\alpha \\cdot GFR_0}$$\nNotice that $Scr_{final\\_ss} = 2 \\cdot Scr(0)$. Halving the clearance rate doubles the eventual steady-state concentration.\n\nNow, we substitute the initial condition $Scr(0)$, the final steady state $Scr_{final\\_ss}$, and the rate constant $k_{AKI}$ into the general solution:\n$$Scr(t) = Scr_{final\\_ss} + (Scr(0) - Scr_{final\\_ss}) e^{-k_{AKI}t}$$\n$$Scr(t) = (2 \\cdot Scr(0)) + (Scr(0) - 2 \\cdot Scr(0)) e^{-k_{AKI}t}$$\n$$Scr(t) = 2 \\cdot Scr(0) - Scr(0) e^{-k_{AKI}t}$$\n$$Scr(t) = Scr(0) \\left( 2 - e^{-k_{AKI}t} \\right)$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $Scr(0)$ and $k_{AKI}$:\n$$Scr(t) = \\left(\\frac{G}{\\alpha \\cdot GFR_0}\\right) \\left( 2 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.5 \\cdot \\alpha \\cdot GFR_0}{V} t\\right) \\right)$$\nThis is the final analytical solution for $Scr(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$.

It uses a standard one-compartment pharmacokinetic model, which is a well-established simplification for analyzing drug disposition. The values for patient mass, volume of distribution, and creatinine clearance are clinically plausible for an adult patient with CKD. The assumption that gentamicin clearance approximates creatinine clearance is a standard clinical practice, as gentamicin is primarily eliminated by glomerular filtration. The target concentrations are within the accepted therapeutic range for extended-interval dosing of gentamicin.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information to calculate the two unknown variables, the dose ($D$) and the dosing interval ($\\tau$), using two independent constraints ($C_{peak}$ and $C_{trough}$). The language is precise and objective, with no ambiguities. The problem is self-contained and internally consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived based on fundamental pharmacokinetic principles.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first calculating the patient-specific pharmacokinetic parameters (volume of distribution, clearance, and elimination rate constant) and then using these parameters to determine the dose and dosing interval that satisfy the target peak and trough concentrations.\n\nFirst, the total volume of distribution, $V_d$, is calculated from the patient's body mass and the specific volume of distribution.\n$$V_d = (0.25 \\text{ L/kg}) \\times (80 \\text{ kg}) = 20 \\text{ L}$$\n\nNext, the drug clearance, $Cl$, is determined. The problem states that $Cl$ equals the creatinine clearance, $Cl_{cr}$. The units of $Cl_{cr}$ must be converted from milliliters per minute to liters per hour to be consistent with the desired units for the dosing interval.\n$$Cl = Cl_{cr} = 25 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}}$$\n$$Cl = \\left(25 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1 \\text{ L}}{1000 \\text{ mL}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{60 \\text{ min}}{1 \\text{ hr}}\\right) = 1.5 \\frac{\\text{L}}{\\text{hr}}$$\n\nWith $V_d$ and $Cl$ known, the first-order elimination rate constant, $k$, can be calculated. The relationship is given by:\n$$k = \\frac{Cl}{V_d}$$\n$$k = \\frac{1.5 \\text{ L/hr}}{20 \\text{ L}} = 0.075 \\text{ hr}^{-1}$$\n\nThe loading dose, $D$, is determined by the target peak concentration, $C_{peak}$. For an intravenous bolus dose with instantaneous distribution, the peak concentration is the initial concentration, $C_0$, which is the dose divided by the volume of distribution.\n$$C_{peak} = C_0 = \\frac{D}{V_d}$$\nRearranging for the dose, $D$:\n$$D = C_{peak} \\times V_d$$\n$$D = (15 \\text{ mg/L}) \\times (20 \\text{ L}) = 300 \\text{ mg}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the dose is $300$ mg.\n\nThe dosing interval, $\\tau$, is the time required for the drug concentration to decay from $C_{peak}$ to $C_{trough}$. The concentration at any time $t$ after a single bolus dose is described by the first-order elimination equation:\n$$C(t) = C_{peak} \\exp(-kt)$$\nAt time $t=\\tau$, the concentration is the trough concentration, $C_{trough}$.\n$$C_{trough} = C_{peak} \\exp(-k\\tau)$$\nTo solve for $\\tau$, we first isolate the exponential term:\n$$\\frac{C_{trough}}{C_{peak}} = \\exp(-k\\tau)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{trough}}{C_{peak}}\\right) = -k\\tau$$\nSolving for $\\tau$:\n$$\\tau = -\\frac{1}{k} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{trough}}{C_{peak}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{k} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{peak}}{C_{trough}}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{1}{0.075 \\text{ hr}^{-1}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{15 \\text{ mg/L}}{0.5 \\text{ mg/L}}\\right)$$\n$$\\tau = \\frac{1}{0.075} \\ln(30) \\text{ hr}$$\nUsing the value of the natural logarithm, $\\ln(30) \\approx 3.40119738$:\n$$\\tau \\approx \\frac{3.40119738}{0.075} \\text{ hr} \\approx 45.3492984 \\text{ hr}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the dosing interval is $45.35$ hours.\n\nThe calculated dosing regimen consists of a loading dose of $300$ mg and a dosing interval of $45.35$ hours.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n300 & 45.35\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4944876"}]}
