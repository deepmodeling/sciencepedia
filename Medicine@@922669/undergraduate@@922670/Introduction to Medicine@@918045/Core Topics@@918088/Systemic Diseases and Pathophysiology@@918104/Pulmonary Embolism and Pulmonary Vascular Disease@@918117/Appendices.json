It presents a standard, formalizable problem without contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe derivation begins with the analogy between Ohm's law for electrical circuits and the pressure-flow relationship in hemodynamics. Ohm's law states that the voltage difference ($\\Delta V$) across a resistor is the product of the current ($I$) flowing through it and its resistance ($R$).\n\n$$ \\Delta V = I \\times R $$\n\nThis can be rearranged to solve for resistance:\n\n$$ R = \\frac{\\Delta V}{I} $$\n\nIn the context of fluid dynamics, and specifically hemodynamics, we can establish a direct analogy:\n- Voltage difference ($\\Delta V$) is analogous to the pressure gradient ($\\Delta P$) across a vascular bed.\n- Electric current ($I$) is analogous to the rate of blood flow ($Q$) through the vascular bed.\n- Electrical resistance ($R$) is analogous to vascular resistance ($R_{vasc}$).\n\nApplying this analogy, the equation for vascular resistance is:\n\n$$ R_{vasc} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{Q} $$\n\nWe are tasked with finding the pulmonary vascular resistance ($PVR$). Therefore, we must apply this general relationship to the pulmonary circulation.\n- The vascular resistance, $R_{vasc}$, becomes the pulmonary vascular resistance, $PVR$.\n- The flow, $Q$, through the pulmonary circulation is the total output of the right ventricle, which by definition is the cardiac output, $CO$.\n- The pressure gradient, $\\Delta P$, is the pressure difference from the beginning of the pulmonary circuit to its end.\n\nThe pulmonary circulation begins at the main pulmonary artery and ends at the point where the pulmonary veins drain into the left atrium.\n- The pressure at the beginning of the circuit is the mean pulmonary arterial pressure, abbreviated as $mPAP$.\n- The pressure at the end of the circuit is the mean left atrial pressure, abbreviated as $LAP$.\n\nTherefore, the pressure gradient across the pulmonary circulation is:\n\n$$ \\Delta P = mPAP - LAP $$\n\nSubstituting these specific terms into the general hemodynamic resistance equation gives the expression for $PVR$:\n\n$$ PVR = \\frac{mPAP - LAP}{CO} $$\n\nThe problem requires using measurable quantities from right heart catheterization. While $mPAP$ and $CO$ are measured directly, left atrial pressure ($LAP$) is not typically measured directly during this procedure.

This obstructs blood flow from the pulmonary artery, creating a static column of blood between the catheter tip and the left atrium. The pressure measured under this condition, $PCWP$, reflects the downstream pressure in the pulmonary veins and, consequently, provides an accurate estimate of the mean left atrial pressure.\n\nThis is the key physiological substitution:\n\n$$ LAP \\approx PCWP $$\n\nSubstituting $PCWP$ for $LAP$ in our equation yields the final, clinically applicable expression for pulmonary vascular resistance:\n\n$$ PVR = \\frac{mPAP - PCWP}{CO} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the result in Wood units.
