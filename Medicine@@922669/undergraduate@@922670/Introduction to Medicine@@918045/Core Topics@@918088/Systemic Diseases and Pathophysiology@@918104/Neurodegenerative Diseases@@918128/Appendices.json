{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding neurodegenerative diseases begins with identifying and quantifying risk factors at the population level. Epidemiologists use specific metrics to compare the likelihood of disease in different groups. This first practice introduces the concept of relative risk, a fundamental tool for measuring the strength of association between an exposure, such as a genetic variant like the $APOE4$ allele, and a disease outcome like Alzheimer's disease. Mastering this calculation is the first step toward interpreting the large-scale studies that inform our understanding of disease causation.

Over a follow-up of $1$ year, the observed one-year incidence proportion of newly diagnosed Alzheimer’s disease in APOE4 carriers is $3\\%$ per year and in non-carriers is $1\\%$ per year. Using only fundamental epidemiological definitions of incidence proportion and comparative risk measures applicable to cohort data, compute the relative risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease in APOE4 carriers compared to non-carriers over $1$ year. Express the relative risk as a decimal rounded to three significant figures. Then, in one sentence, interpret the clinical significance of this relative risk in the context of Alzheimer’s disease risk over $1$ year. Do not include any units in your numerical answer.", "solution": "We begin from core epidemiologic definitions appropriate for cohort studies. The one-year incidence proportion (risk) in a group is defined as the proportion of at-risk individuals who develop the outcome during the specified time period. A standard comparative measure for cohort data is the relative risk, defined as the ratio of the risk in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group.\n\nLet the exposure be apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele (APOE4) carriage. Denote the one-year risk in the exposed group (carriers) as $R_{E}$ and the one-year risk in the unexposed group (non-carriers) as $R_{U}$.

Modern medicine relies on biomarkers, such as those detected by amyloid PET scans, to refine diagnosis. This exercise demonstrates how to apply Bayes' theorem to update your initial clinical suspicion (pretest probability) after receiving a new piece of evidence, a crucial skill for any diagnostician. By working through this scenario, you will see how concepts like sensitivity and specificity translate into a concrete posterior probability of disease.

The amyloid PET has sensitivity $0.90$ and specificity $0.85$ for detecting the pathological process associated with AD. Based on age, clinical features, and cognitive testing, the patient’s pretest probability of AD is estimated at $0.30$. The patient’s amyloid PET result returns positive.\n\nStarting from the foundational definitions of conditional probability and Bayes’ theorem, and using the definitions of sensitivity as $P(+|D)$ and specificity as $P(-|\\neg D)$, derive an expression for the posterior probability $P(D|+)$ of AD given a positive test result and then compute its value for this patient. Express the final probability as a decimal number.", "solution": "The problem asks for the posterior probability of a patient having Alzheimer’s disease ($D$) given a positive amyloid PET test result ($+$), denoted as $P(D|+)$. We are to derive this expression starting from foundational principles and then compute its value.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has Alzheimer's disease, and $\\neg D$ be the event that the patient does not have the disease. Let $+$ denote a positive test result and $-$ denote a negative test result.\n\nThe given information is:\n1.  The sensitivity of the test, which is the probability of a positive test result given the presence of the disease: $P(+|D) = 0.90$.\n2.  The specificity of the test, which is the probability of a negative test result given the absence of the disease: $P(-|\\neg D) = 0.85$.\n3.  The pretest probability (or prior probability) of the patient having the disease: $P(D) = 0.30$.\n\nOur goal is to compute $P(D|+)$.\n\nWe begin with the fundamental definition of conditional probability for two events $A$ and $B$:\n$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\nApplying this definition to our problem, we set $A=D$ and $B=+$, which yields:\n$$P(D|+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap +)}{P(+)}$$\nThe joint probability $P(D \\cap +)$ can be re-expressed using the definition of conditional probability again: $P(+|D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap +)}{P(D)}$, which rearranges to $P(D \\cap +) = P(+|D)P(D)$. Substituting this into our expression for $P(D|+)$ gives us the numerator of Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D|+) = \\frac{P(+|D)P(D)}{P(+)}$$\nThis is the general form of Bayes' theorem for this context.\n\nNext, we must find an expression for the denominator, $P(+)$, which is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. A positive result can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios:\n1.  The patient has the disease and tests positive (event $D \\cap +$).\n2.  The patient does not have the disease and tests positive (event $\\neg D \\cap +$).\n\nBy the law of total probability, $P(+)$ is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n$$P(+) = P(D \\cap +) + P(\\neg D \\cap +)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term, we have:\n$P(D \\cap +) = P(+|D)P(D)$\n$P(\\neg D \\cap +) = P(+|\\neg D)P(\\neg D)$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(+)$ gives:\n$$P(+) = P(+|D)P(D) + P(+|\\neg D)P(\\neg D)$$\nNow, we can substitute this expanded form of the denominator back into our expression for $P(D|+)$, resulting in the full form of Bayes' theorem for this problem:\n$$P(D|+) = \\frac{P(+|D)P(D)}{P(+|D)P(D) + P(+|\\neg D)P(\\neg D)}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the posterior probability.\n\nTo compute the value, we need the numerical values for all terms in this expression. We are given:\n- $P(+|D) = 0.90$\n- $P(D) = 0.30$\n\nWe must deduce the remaining terms:\n- The probability of not having the disease is the complement of having the disease: $P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\n- The term $P(+|\\neg D)$ is the false positive rate. We are given the specificity, $P(-|\\neg D) = 0.85$. Since a test on a non-diseased person must be either positive or negative, the sum of their probabilities is $1$: $P(+|\\neg D) + P(-|\\neg D) = 1$. Therefore, $P(+|\\neg D) = 1 - P(-|\\neg D) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$.\n\nNow we substitute all the numerical values into the derived formula:\n$$P(D|+) = \\frac{(0.90)(0.30)}{(0.90)(0.30) + (0.15)(0.70)}$$\nFirst, we calculate the products in the numerator and the denominator:\n- Numerator: $(0.90) \\times (0.30) = 0.27$\n- Denominator, first term: $(0.90) \\times (0.30) = 0.27$\n- Denominator, second term: $(0.15) \\times (0.70) = 0.105$\n\nSubstitute these values back into the fraction:\n$$P(D|+) = \\frac{0.27}{0.27 + 0.105}$$\n$$P(D|+) = \\frac{0.27}{0.375}$$\nTo compute the final value, we perform the division:\n$$P(D|+) = \\frac{270}{375} = \\frac{54}{75} = \\frac{18}{25} = 0.72$$\nThus, the posterior probability of the patient having Alzheimer's disease given the positive test result is $0.72$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.72}$$", "id": "4970825"}, {"introduction": "After establishing a diagnosis, the next question is often about treatment. Evaluating the effectiveness of a new therapy requires moving beyond relative risk reductions to metrics that are more directly interpretable in a clinical setting.
