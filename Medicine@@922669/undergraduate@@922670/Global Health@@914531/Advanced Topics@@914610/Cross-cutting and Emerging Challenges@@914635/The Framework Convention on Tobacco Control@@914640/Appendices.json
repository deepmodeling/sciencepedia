Consider a government that imposes an ad valorem tobacco excise tax at rate $t$ on the pre-tax retail price of a tobacco product. Assume complete pass-through of the tax to consumers, so the consumer price rises multiplicatively. Let baseline pre-tax retail price be $P$ and baseline annual consumption be $Q$. Suppose tobacco demand exhibits a constant price elasticity of demand of magnitude $e$ (that is, price elasticity is $-e$), and the law of demand in the relevant range holds.

The problem is well-posed and grounded in standard microeconomic principles.\n\nWe begin with the core definition of the price elasticity of demand, $E_d$. It is defined as the percentage change in quantity demanded, $Q_d$, in response to a one percent change in price, $P'$. The problem states that this elasticity is constant and equal to $-e$.\n\n$$E_d = \\frac{d Q_d / Q_d}{d P' / P'} = \\frac{P'}{Q_d} \\frac{d Q_d}{d P'} = -e$$\n\nHere, $e > 0$ since the law of demand holds. To find the demand function $Q_d(P')$, we must solve this first-order ordinary differential equation. We can separate the variables $Q_d$ and $P'$:\n\n$$\\frac{d Q_d}{Q_d} = -e \\frac{d P'}{P'}$$\n\nIntegrating both sides yields:\n\n$$\\int \\frac{1}{Q_d} d Q_d = \\int -e \\frac{1}{P'} d P'$$\n$$\\ln(Q_d) = -e \\ln(P') + C$$\n\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. To solve for $Q_d$, we exponentiate both sides:\n\n$$Q_d(P') = \\exp(-e \\ln(P') + C) = \\exp(\\ln((P')^{-e})) \\exp(C)$$\n\nLet the constant $A = \\exp(C)$. The demand function takes the form of a constant-elasticity demand curve:\n\n$$Q_d(P') = A (P')^{-e}$$\n\nTo determine the constant $A$, we use the given baseline conditions. The baseline pre-tax retail price is $P$, and at this price, baseline annual consumption is $Q$. In the absence of a tax, the consumer price $P'$ is equal to the pre-tax price $P$. Therefore, we have the point $(P, Q)$ on the demand curve. Substituting these values into our demand function:\n\n$$Q = A (P)^{-e}$$\n\nSolving for the constant $A$:\n\n$$A = Q P^e$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $A$ back into the general demand function gives us the specific demand equation for this market:\n\n$$Q_d(P') = (Q P^e) (P')^{-e} = Q \\left(\\frac{P'}{P}\\right)^{-e}$$\n\nNext, we analyze the effect of the ad valorem tax. The tax is imposed at a rate $t$ on the pre-tax retail price, which we take to be the baseline price $P$. The problem states that there is complete pass-through of the tax to consumers. This means the consumer price increases by the full amount of the tax.\n\nThe tax amount per unit is $t \\times P$.\nThe new consumer price, let's call it $P'_{tax}$, is the sum of the pre-tax price and the tax per unit:\n\n$$P'_{tax} = P + tP = P(1+t)$$\n\nTo find the new quantity demanded after the tax is imposed, $Q_{tax}$, we substitute this new consumer price $P'_{tax}$ into our specific demand function:\n\n$$Q_{tax} = Q_d(P'_{tax}) = Q \\left(\\frac{P'_{tax}}{P}\\right)^{-e}$$\n$$Q_{tax} = Q \\left(\\frac{P(1+t)}{P}\\right)^{-e}$$\n$$Q_{tax} = Q(1+t)^{-e}$$\n\nFinally, the total annual tax revenue, $R$, is the tax collected per unit multiplied by the total number of units sold, $Q_{tax}$.\n\nThe tax per unit is $tP$.\nThe number of units sold is $Q_{tax}$.\n\nTherefore, the revenue $R$ as a function of the given parameters is:\n\n$$R(t, e, P, Q) = (\\text{Tax per unit}) \\times (\\text{Quantity sold})$$\n$$R(t, e, P, Q) = (tP) \\times (Q(1+t)^{-e})$$\n$$R(t, e, P, Q) = tPQ(1+t)^{-e}$$\n\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the expected annual tax revenue.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{tPQ(1+t)^{-e}}$$", "id": "5003048"}, {"introduction": "While economic models help us understand the mechanisms of tobacco control, the ultimate measure of success is the improvement in public health.

It uses established concepts from epidemiology and public health, such as smoking prevalence, relative risk, incidence, and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) is a legitimate international treaty, and evaluating its impact using metrics like DALYs averted is a standard practice in global health.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. The objective is to compute a specific quantity (DALYs averted), and all necessary data and definitions are provided. The assumptions, such as the immediate effect of prevalence change on risk, are explicitly stated simplifications that render the problem tractable and do not introduce logical contradictions. The problem is self-contained, as the baseline risk for non-smokers, while not given directly, can be derived from the provided overall incidence rate, prevalence, and relative risk.\n\nThe problem is objective, presenting quantitative data and clear definitions without subjective or speculative language. It does not violate any fundamental scientific principles, is not trivial, and can be solved using a logical sequence of calculations based on the provided framework.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe total health burden averted is measured in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). A DALY represents one lost year of \"healthy\" life. The DALY metric is the sum of Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to premature mortality and Years Lived with Disability (YLD) due to morbidity.\n$$\n\\text{DALY} = \\text{YLL} + \\text{YLD}\n$$\nThe goal is to calculate the total DALYs averted, which is the product of the number of IHD events averted and the average DALYs lost per event.\n\nFirst, we calculate the average DALYs associated with a single IHD event. An event has two possible outcomes: death or survival with disability.\n- The proportion of cases resulting in death is $f = 0.15$. The YLL for each death is $L=10$ years.\n- The proportion of cases resulting in survival is $(1-f) = 0.85$. The YLD for each survivor is the product of the disability weight $DW = 0.20$ and the duration of disability $D = 5$ years.\n\nThe average DALYs per IHD event, denoted $\\text{DALY}_{\\text{event}}$, is the weighted average of the DALYs for each outcome:\n$$\n\\text{DALY}_{\\text{event}} = (f \\times L) + ((1-f) \\times DW \\times D)\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\text{DALY}_{\\text{event}} = (0.15 \\times 10) + ((1-0.15) \\times 0.20 \\times 5) = 1.5 + (0.85 \\times 1.0) = 2.35\n$$\n\nNext, we must determine the number of IHD events averted due to the reduction in smoking prevalence. The observed incidence rate, $I_{obs}$, is a weighted average of the incidence rates in non-smokers ($I_{ns}$) and smokers ($I_{s}$) at the initial prevalence $p_0$:\n$$\nI_{obs} = I_{ns} \\cdot (1-p_0) + I_{s} \\cdot p_0\n$$\nThe relative risk, $RR$, is defined as the ratio of incidence in the exposed (smokers) to the unexposed (non-smokers):\n$$\nRR = \\frac{I_s}{I_{ns}} \\implies I_s = RR \\cdot I_{ns}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $I_{obs}$:\n$$\nI_{obs} = I_{ns} \\cdot (1-p_0) + (RR \\cdot I_{ns}) \\cdot p_0 = I_{ns} \\cdot (1 - p_0 + RR \\cdot p_0) = I_{ns} \\cdot (1 + p_0(RR-1))\n$$\nWe can solve for the baseline incidence rate in non-smokers, $I_{ns}$, which is assumed to be stable:\n$$\nI_{ns} = \\frac{I_{obs}}{1 + p_0(RR-1)}\n$$\nUsing the given values $I_{obs} = 0.004$, $p_0 = 0.30$, and $RR = 2.0$:\n$$\nI_{ns} = \\frac{0.004}{1 + 0.30(2.0-1)} = \\frac{0.004}{1 + 0.30} = \\frac{0.004}{1.3}\n$$\n\nThe total number of IHD events at a given prevalence $p$ in a population of size $N$ is $E(p) = N \\times I(p)$, where $I(p) = I_{ns} \\cdot (1 + p(RR-1))$.\nThe number of events averted, $\\Delta E$, is the difference between the number of events at prevalence $p_0$ and the number at prevalence $p_1$:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E(p_0) - E(p_1) = N \\cdot I(p_0) - N \\cdot I(p_1)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E = N \\cdot [I_{ns} \\cdot (1 + p_0(RR-1)) - I_{ns} \\cdot (1 + p_1(RR-1))]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E = N \\cdot I_{ns} \\cdot [(1 + p_0(RR-1)) - (1 + p_1(RR-1))]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E = N \\cdot I_{ns} \\cdot (p_0 - p_1)(RR-1)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I_{ns}$:\n$$\n\\Delta E = N \\cdot \\left(\\frac{I_{obs}}{1 + p_0(RR-1)}\\right) \\cdot (p_0 - p_1)(RR-1)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values to calculate $\\Delta E$:\n$$\n\\Delta E = (1.5 \\times 10^{6}) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{0.004}{1.3}\\right) \\cdot (0.30 - 0.24)(2.0 - 1.0)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E = (1.5 \\times 10^{6}) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{0.004}{1.3}\\right) \\cdot (0.06)(1.0) = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{6} \\times 0.004 \\times 0.06}{1.3} = \\frac{360}{1.3} \\approx 276.923\n$$\n\nFinally, the total DALYs averted is the product of the number of events averted and the DALYs per event:\n$$\n\\text{DALYs Averted} = \\Delta E \\times \\text{DALY}_{\\text{event}}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{DALYs Averted} = \\frac{360}{1.3} \\times 2.35 = \\frac{846}{1.3} \\approx 650.76923...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\text{DALYs Averted} \\approx 650.8\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{650.8}$$", "id": "5000905"}, {"introduction": "Implementing FCTC measures often involves navigating complex legal and economic landscapes, particularly concerning international trade agreements.

The policy induces a number of smokers, $N \\times \\Delta p$, to quit. These individuals subsequently avoid the annual smoking-attributable mortality hazard, $m$.
