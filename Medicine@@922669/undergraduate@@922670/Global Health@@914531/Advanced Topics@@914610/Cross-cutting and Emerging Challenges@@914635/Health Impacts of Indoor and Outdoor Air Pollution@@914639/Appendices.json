The model treats the residence as a single, well-mixed zone of constant volume, $V$. The principle of conservation of mass states that the rate of change of the mass of pollutants inside the volume is equal to the rate of mass entering minus the rate of mass leaving.\n\nThe mass of PM2.5 indoors is $M_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) = V C_{\\mathrm{in}}(t)$. The rate of change of this mass is $\\frac{dM_{\\mathrm{in}}}{dt}$. Since $V$ is constant, this is $V \\frac{dC_{\\mathrm{in}}}{dt}$.\n\nThe rate of mass entering the zone is due to infiltration of outdoor air. The volume flow rate of infiltrating air is given by the product of the air exchange rate, $a$, and the zone volume, $V$. The outdoor concentration is $C_{\\mathrm{out}}$. However, only a fraction $P$, the penetration factor, of these particles successfully enters the indoor environment. Therefore, the mass flow rate of PM2.5 into the zone is:\n$$ \\text{Rate In} = P \\cdot a \\cdot V \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{out}} $$\n\nThe rate of mass leaving the zone is due to two removal processes: ventilation (exfiltration) and particle deposition.\n1.  Removal by ventilation: Air leaves the zone at the same volume flow rate it enters, $aV$. The concentration of particles in this exiting air is the well-mixed indoor concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{in}}(t)$. The mass removal rate due to ventilation is:\n    $$ \\text{Rate Out (ventilation)} = a \\cdot V \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) $$\n2.  Removal by deposition: This is a first-order loss process with a rate constant $k$. The rate of mass removal is proportional to the total mass of particles present indoors, $M_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) = V C_{\\mathrm{in}}(t)$. The mass removal rate due to deposition is:\n    $$ \\text{Rate Out (deposition)} = k \\cdot V \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) $$\n\nThe total rate of mass leaving the zone is the sum of these two removal rates:\n$$ \\text{Total Rate Out} = a V C_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) + k V C_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) = (a+k) V C_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) $$\n\nThe complete mass balance differential equation is:\n$$ \\frac{dM_{\\mathrm{in}}}{dt} = \\text{Rate In} - \\text{Total Rate Out} $$\n$$ V \\frac{dC_{\\mathrm{in}}(t)}{dt} = (P \\cdot a \\cdot V \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{out}}) - ((a+k) V C_{\\mathrm{in}}(t)) $$\n\nWe can divide the entire equation by the volume $V$ (which is non-zero) to obtain the equation in terms of concentrations and rate constants:\n$$ \\frac{dC_{\\mathrm{in}}(t)}{dt} = P \\cdot a \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{out}} - (a+k)C_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) $$\n\nTo find the steady-state solution, we set the rate of change of the indoor concentration to zero, $\\frac{dC_{\\mathrm{in}}(t)}{dt} = 0$.

The core calculation relies on the principle of conservation of mass. The provided values for concentration ($C$), inhalation rate ($IR$), and deposition fraction ($DF$) are realistic and within ranges commonly used in exposure science literature. For instance, the World Health Organization's 24-hour mean air quality guideline for PM$_{2.5}$ is $15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{m}^3$, making an exposure of $35\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{m}^3$ a plausible, though elevated, scenario.

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a unique solution to the calculation. The language is objective and uses standard terminology. The problem does not violate any of the checks for invalidity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to calculate the total mass of PM$_{2.5}$ deposited in the alveolar region of the lungs over a $24$-hour period. This quantity, denoted as $M_{dep}$, can be determined from the given parameters.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total volume of air inhaled by the individual over the exposure duration, $T$. This volume, $V_{inh}$, is the product of the constant inhalation rate, $IR$, and the time period, $T$.\n$$V_{inh} = IR \\times T$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$V_{inh} = (0.5\\,\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{h}) \\times (24\\,\\mathrm{h}) = 12\\,\\mathrm{m}^3$$\nThis is the total volume of air breathed in one day.\n\nNext, we calculate the total mass of PM$_{2.5}$ inhaled, $M_{inh}$. This is the product of the ambient concentration of the pollutant, $C$, and the total volume of air inhaled, $V_{inh}$. This follows from the definition of concentration (mass per unit volume).\n$$M_{inh} = C \\times V_{inh}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $V_{inh}$:\n$$M_{inh} = C \\times IR \\times T$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$M_{inh} = (35\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{m}^3) \\times (0.5\\,\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{h}) \\times (24\\,\\mathrm{h})$$\n$$M_{inh} = (35\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{m}^3) \\times (12\\,\\mathrm{m}^3) = 420\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$$\nThis is the total mass of PM$_{2.5}$ that enters the respiratory system.\n\nFinally, the mass deposited in the alveolar region, $M_{dep}$, is the fraction of the total inhaled mass that is not exhaled or deposited in the upper airways, but specifically settles in the alveoli. This is determined by the alveolar deposition fraction, $DF$.\n$$M_{dep} = M_{inh} \\times DF$$\nSubstituting the expression for $M_{inh}$:\n$$M_{dep} = C \\times IR \\times T \\times DF$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$M_{dep} = (420\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}) \\times 0.3$$\n$$M_{dep} = 126\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $126$ already contains three significant figures.\n\n### Health Significance Interpretation\nThe calculated daily deposited mass in the alveolar region is $126\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$. While this mass may seem small, its health significance is profound due to the location and nature of the deposition. The alveolar region is the site of gas exchange between the air and the bloodstream. Unlike the upper airways, this region lacks an efficient mucociliary clearance mechanism. Consequently, insoluble particles deposited here can be retained for long periods (weeks to years).\n\nThis retained particulate mass, comprising billions of individual particles, can initiate a cascade of adverse biological responses. The primary local effect is pulmonary inflammation. Alveolar macrophages attempt to engulf the foreign particles, triggering the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. This creates a state of oxidative stress and chronic inflammation in the lung tissue, which can exacerbate conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nMore critically, due to their small size, a fraction of these PM$_{2.5}$ particles (particularly the smallest, known as ultrafine particles) can translocate across the thin alveolar-capillary barrier and enter the systemic circulation. Once in the bloodstream, these particles can travel throughout the body, causing systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. They have been shown to promote endothelial dysfunction (impairing blood vessel function), accelerate atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arteries), and alter cardiac autonomic function. These systemic effects are the established pathways linking PM$_{2.5}$ exposure to increased risks of cardiovascular events such as hypertension, myocardial infarction (heart attack), and stroke. Therefore, a daily deposited dose of $126\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$ in the most sensitive part of the lung represents a significant challenge to homeostasis and is a key driver of the cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality associated with air pollution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{126}$$", "id": "4980740"}, {"introduction": "Ultimately, the goal of studying air pollution is to protect public health by quantifying risk.
