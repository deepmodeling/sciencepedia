This foundational exercise introduces a core tool in public health: the population-standardized rate, which allows for fair comparisons across different areas. By calculating the change in fast-food outlet density, you will practice quantifying a key feature of the urban \"food environment,\" directly linking a simple calculation to the broader challenge of diet-related diseases in cities [@problem_id:5007819].", "problem": "A municipal public health department is assessing changes in the neighborhood food environment as part of an urbanization and urban health monitoring program. Consider a district with a stable mid-year population of $50{,}000$ residents over a $1$-year observation period. During this period, $5$ new fast-food outlets open and none close. The department reports outlet density standardized per a common population base, namely per $10{,}000$ residents.\n\nStarting from the core public health definition that a population-standardized density is a count normalized by the population and scaled to a fixed base, compute the change in fast-food outlet density attributable to these $5$ openings. State your final numeric result rounded to three significant figures. Express the final value in units of outlets per $10{,}000$ residents. Then, briefly consider how such a change, in principle, might influence diet-related health outcomes in an urban setting via plausible mechanisms; your discussion will not be graded numerically, but it should be grounded in established pathways in urban health.\n\nRound your numerical answer to three significant figures and express it in outlets per $10{,}000$ residents. Provide only the numerical value in your final answer box (units should not be included in the box).", "solution": "The task is to compute the change in a population-standardized density due solely to the opening of new fast-food outlets when the population is held constant. The fundamental base is the standard epidemiological definition of a population-standardized density: for a count $X$ of entities in a population of size $N$, the density per a fixed base $B$ is given conceptually by the normalized count $X/N$ scaled to $B$, which yields $X/N$ times $B$. This is a core definition used to compare quantities across populations of different sizes by standardizing to a common base.\n\nLet $N$ denote the district population, $B$ the standardization base, $C$ the initial count of fast-food outlets, and $\\Delta C$ the net change in count over the observation period. The density at baseline is $(C/N)\\times B$, and the density after the change is $((C+\\Delta C)/N)\\times B$. Therefore, the change in density, denoted $\\Delta D$, is\n$$\n\\Delta D \\;=\\; \\left(\\frac{C+\\Delta C}{N}\\right) B \\;-\\; \\left(\\frac{C}{N}\\right) B \\;=\\; \\left(\\frac{\\Delta C}{N}\\right) B.\n$$\nThis shows that the change in density depends only on the change in count, the population, and the chosen base, and is independent of the baseline count.\n\nIn this scenario, the population is $N = 50{,}000$, the base is $B = 10{,}000$, and the change in count is $\\Delta C = 5$. Substituting,\n$$\n\\Delta D \\;=\\; \\left(\\frac{5}{50{,}000}\\right) \\times 10{,}000 \\;=\\; \\frac{5 \\times 10{,}000}{50{,}000} \\;=\\; \\frac{50{,}000}{50{,}000} \\;=\\; 1.\n$$\nThus, the change in fast-food outlet density is exactly $1$ outlet per $10{,}000$ residents. Rounding to three significant figures preserves this as $1.00$ in decimal form. The units are outlets per $10{,}000$ residents.\n\nInterpretation of potential implications for diet-related health (not graded numerically): In urban health, increased density of fast-food outlets can alter the local food environment through several plausible mechanisms. First, increased proximity and availability may reduce travel costs and increase exposure to energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods, potentially shifting dietary intake patterns toward higher caloric and sodium consumption. Second, greater competition can drive pricing and promotional strategies that increase purchase frequency. Third, environmental cues and convenience can influence habitual choices, especially in time-constrained urban populations. Over time, such changes can contribute at the population level to increased body mass index distribution, higher prevalence of overweight and obesity, and elevated risk of diet-related noncommunicable diseases such as type $2$ diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The magnitude of impact would depend on mediators such as household income, food literacy, the presence of healthy alternatives, zoning, and concurrent public health interventions. Nonetheless, the observed increase of $1$ outlet per $10{,}000$ residents quantifies a meaningful shift in the retail food environment that could influence dietary behaviors in the district.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.00}$$", "id": "5007819"}, {"introduction": "After measuring the environment, the next step is to understand how it affects individuals based on their daily lives. This practice moves from a population-level view to personal exposure, focusing on air pollution, a major urban health risk.

We will use the potential outcomes framework as specified.\n\nLet $Y_{it}$ denote the observed outcome, which is diarrhea prevalence, for group $i$ at time period $t$.\nLet $i \\in \\{I, C\\}$, where $I$ represents the intervention group and $C$ represents the control group.\nLet $t \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, where $t=0$ denotes the baseline period (before the intervention) and $t=1$ denotes the follow-up period (after the intervention).\n\nThe data provided can be summarized as follows:\n- Prevalence in the intervention group at baseline: $Y_{I,0} = 0.15$\n- Prevalence in the intervention group at follow-up: $Y_{I,1} = 0.10$\n- Prevalence in the control group at baseline: $Y_{C,0} = 0.12$\n- Prevalence in the control group at follow-up: $Y_{C,1} = 0.11$\n\nIn the potential outcomes framework, let $Y_{it}(1)$ be the potential outcome for group $i$ at time $t$ if exposed to the intervention, and $Y_{it}(0)$ be the potential outcome if not exposed. The intervention is administered to group $I$ at time $t=1$. Therefore, the observed outcomes are related to potential outcomes as follows:\n- $Y_{I,1} = E[Y_{I,1}(1)]$ (Intervention group is treated at follow-up)\n- $Y_{C,1} = E[Y_{C,1}(0)]$ (Control group is not treated at follow-up)\n- $Y_{I,0} = E[Y_{I,0}(0)]$ (Intervention group is not treated at baseline)\n- $Y_{C,0} = E[Y_{C,0}(0)]$ (Control group is not treated at baseline)\n\nThe causal effect of interest is the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT), which is the effect of the intervention on the group that actually received it. It is defined as the difference between the intervention group's outcome with treatment and their counterfactual outcome without treatment:\n$$\n\\text{ATT} = E[Y_{I,1}(1) - Y_{I,1}(0)]\n$$\nWe observe $E[Y_{I,1}(1)]$, which is the mean outcome $Y_{I,1}$. However, the term $E[Y_{I,1}(0)]$ is the counterfactual: the prevalence of diarrhea that the intervention group would have experienced at follow-up had they not received the program. This term is unobservable.\n\nTo estimate this unobservable counterfactual, we use the identifying assumption stated in the problem: the parallel trends assumption. This assumption posits that, in the absence of the intervention, the change in the outcome from baseline to follow-up would have been the same for both the intervention and control groups.

The negative sign indicates a decrease.

While the prevalence in the intervention areas decreased by $5$ percentage points (from $0.15$ to $0.10$), the DiD analysis clarifies that only $4$ percentage points of this decline can be attributed to the program itself. The remaining $1$ percentage point reduction is accounted for by the general downward trend in diarrhea prevalence observed in the region during the same period, as captured by the control group.
