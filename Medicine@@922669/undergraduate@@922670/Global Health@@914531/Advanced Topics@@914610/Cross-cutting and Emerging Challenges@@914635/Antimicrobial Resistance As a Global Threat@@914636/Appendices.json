The metric DID (Defined Daily Doses per $1,000$ inhabitants per day) is a standard unit of measurement for drug consumption, widely used by international health organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) for surveillance of antimicrobial consumption.

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data for a unique solution. The language is objective and the data are consistent. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed by first deriving the formula for DID from the stated first principles and then applying it to the provided data.\n\n### Derivation of the DID Formula\nLet $C_{total}$ represent the total consumption of a drug, measured as an aggregate number of Defined Daily Doses (DDD), over a specific time period.\nLet $P$ be the total number of inhabitants in the population.\nLet $T$ be the duration of the observation period in days.\n\nAccording to the provided principles, the metric must be normalized by both the population size and the number of days to ensure comparability.\n\nFirst, we calculate the average consumption per day for the entire population by dividing the total consumption by the number of days in the period:\n$$\n\\text{Consumption per day} = \\frac{C_{total}}{T}\n$$\nThis quantity has units of DDD per day.\n\nNext, to obtain the average consumption per inhabitant per day, we normalize this by the population size:\n$$\n\\text{Consumption per inhabitant per day} = \\frac{C_{total}}{P \\times T}\n$$\nThis quantity has units of DDD per inhabitant per day.\n\nThe definition of DID requires this rate to be expressed per $1,000$ inhabitants, not per single inhabitant. Therefore, we must multiply the per-inhabitant rate by a scaling factor of $1,000$:\n$$\n\\text{DID} = \\left( \\frac{C_{total}}{P \\times T} \\right) \\times 1000\n$$\nThis is the general expression for calculating DID, derived from the first principles of aggregation and normalization as requested.\n\n### Calculation of DID\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Total annual consumption, $C_{total} = 365000$ DDD.\n- Population size, $P = 1000000$ inhabitants.\n- Time period, $T = 365$ days.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\n\\text{DID} = \\left( \\frac{365000}{1000000 \\times 365} \\right) \\times 1000\n$$\nWe can simplify the expression. First, we compute the fraction:\n$$\n\\frac{365000}{365} = 1000\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the equation for DID:\n$$\n\\text{DID} = \\left( \\frac{1000}{1000000} \\right) \\times 1000\n$$\nThe fraction simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{1000}{1000000} = \\frac{1}{1000} = 0.001\n$$\nFinally, we multiply by the scaling factor:\n$$\n\\text{DID} = 0.001 \\times 1000 = 1\n$$\nThe calculated value is $1$ DID, which has units of DDD per $1,000$ inhabitants per day.\n\n### Interpretation of the Result\nThe problem requires an interpretation of the consumption category based on the following thresholds: low if $5$ DID, moderate if $\\ge 5$ and $15$ DID, and high if $\\ge 15$ DID.\nOur calculated value is $\\text{DID} = 1$.

Two drugs are available, drug $A$ and drug $B$.\n-   **Collateral Sensitivity:** Resistance to drug $A$ increases sensitivity to drug $B$.\n-   **Goal:** Design a cycling regimen using drugs $A$ and $B$ that causes the frequency of the $R_A$ subpopulation to decline over time. This is specified as the ratio $N_{R_A}/N_S$ decreasing after each full cycle.\n-   **Dynamical Model Assumptions:**\n    -   (i) Exponential growth: For any subpopulation $i$, its abundance $N_i(t)$ follows $N_i(t) = N_i(0) e^{r_i t}$, where $r_i$ is its constant per-capita Malthusian growth rate under a given drug.\n    -   (ii) Selection: Selection is the difference in per-capita growth rates between subpopulations.\n    -   (iii) Simplifications: Mutation and density dependence are negligible over a single cycle.\n-   **Per-capita Growth Rates (units: $\\text{day}^{-1}$):**\n    -   Under drug $A$: $r_S^{(A)} = -0.5$, $r_{R_A}^{(A)} = 0.1$.\n    -   Under drug $B$: $r_S^{(B)} = -0.1$, $r_{R_A}^{(B)} = -0.6$.\n-   **Cycling Protocol:** Drug $A$ is applied for a duration of $t_A$ days, and drug $B$ is applied for a duration of $t_B$ days.

Let us define this ratio as $P(t) = N_{R_A}(t) / N_S(t)$.\n\nThe condition for a successful preventive regimen is $P(T)  P(0)$, where $T = t_A + t_B$ is the duration of one full cycle.\n\nLet's track the evolution of the ratio $P(t)$ through the two phases of the cycle.\n\n**Phase 1: Drug A application (from $t=0$ to $t=t_A$)**\nAccording to the exponential growth model, the abundances at time $t_A$ are:\n$$N_{R_A}(t_A) = N_{R_A}(0) e^{r_{R_A}^{(A)} t_A}$$\n$$N_S(t_A) = N_S(0) e^{r_S^{(A)} t_A}$$\nThe ratio at the end of this phase is:\n$$P(t_A) = \\frac{N_{R_A}(t_A)}{N_S(t_A)} = \\frac{N_{R_A}(0) e^{r_{R_A}^{(A)} t_A}}{N_S(0) e^{r_S^{(A)} t_A}} = P(0) e^{(r_{R_A}^{(A)} - r_S^{(A)}) t_A}$$\n\n**Phase 2: Drug B application (from $t=t_A$ to $t=t_A+t_B$)**\nThe abundances at the end of the full cycle are calculated using the abundances at $t_A$ as the initial condition for this phase, which lasts for a duration $t_B$:\n$$N_{R_A}(t_A + t_B) = N_{R_A}(t_A) e^{r_{R_A}^{(B)} t_B}$$\n$$N_S(t_A + t_B) = N_S(t_A) e^{r_S^{(B)} t_B}$$\nThe ratio at the end of the full cycle is:\n$$P(t_A + t_B) = \\frac{N_{R_A}(t_A + t_B)}{N_S(t_A + t_B)} = \\frac{N_{R_A}(t_A) e^{r_{R_A}^{(B)} t_B}}{N_S(t_A) e^{r_S^{(B)} t_B}} = P(t_A) e^{(r_{R_A}^{(B)} - r_S^{(B)}) t_B}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(t_A)$:\n$$P(t_A + t_B) = \\left( P(0) e^{(r_{R_A}^{(A)} - r_S^{(A)}) t_A} \\right) e^{(r_{R_A}^{(B)} - r_S^{(B)}) t_B}$$\n$$P(t_A + t_B) = P(0) \\exp\\left[ (r_{R_A}^{(A)} - r_S^{(A)}) t_A + (r_{R_A}^{(B)} - r_S^{(B)}) t_B \\right]$$\n\nThe selection coefficient, $s$, for the resistant strain relative to the susceptible strain under a given drug is the difference in their Malthusian growth rates.\nThe selection coefficient under drug $A$ is $s^{(A)} = r_{R_A}^{(A)} - r_S^{(A)}$.\nThe selection coefficient under drug $B$ is $s^{(B)} = r_{R_A}^{(B)} - r_S^{(B)}$.\nThe equation for the ratio becomes:\n$$P(t_A + t_B) = P(0) e^{s^{(A)} t_A + s^{(B)} t_B}$$\n\nFor the ratio to decrease over a cycle, we require $P(t_A + t_B)  P(0)$. Since $P(0)  0$, this is equivalent to:\n$$e^{s^{(A)} t_A + s^{(B)} t_B}  1$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, the condition for success is:\n$$s^{(A)} t_A + s^{(B)} t_B  0$$\n\nNow, we calculate the selection coefficients using the given growth rates:\n$$s^{(A)} = r_{R_A}^{(A)} - r_S^{(A)} = 0.1 - (-0.5) = 0.6 \\, \\text{day}^{-1}$$\n$$s^{(B)} = r_{R_A}^{(B)} - r_S^{(B)} = -0.6 - (-0.1) = -0.5 \\, \\text{day}^{-1}$$\nAs expected, drug $A$ selects for the resistant strain ($s^{(A)} > 0$), while drug $B$ selects against it ($s^{(B)}  0$), which is the manifestation of collateral sensitivity.\n\nSubstituting these values into the inequality, we get the condition for a successful regimen:\n$$0.6 t_A - 0.5 t_B  0$$\nThis can be rewritten as $0.6 t_A  0.5 t_B$, or $\\frac{t_A}{t_B}  \\frac{0.5}{0.6} = \\frac{5}{6}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nWe now evaluate each proposed regimen against the derived condition $0.6 t_A - 0.5 t_B  0$.\n\n-   **A.
