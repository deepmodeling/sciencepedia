The district population is $1.60 \\times 10^{6}$, and the proportion of children younger than five years is $0.12$. Each SIA round aims to vaccinate a fraction $r$ of the eligible children, with $r = 0.90$. The per-dose probability that a vaccinated child becomes immune (vaccine take, that is, vaccine efficacy at the individual dose level) is $e = 0.60$. Assume independence of vaccination opportunities and vaccine take across rounds, and that once a child becomes immune, they remain immune. The program’s objective is to achieve at least $0.95$ immune coverage in the under-five population through repeated SIA rounds.\n\nOperational parameters are as follows: each vaccination team can vaccinate $120$ children per day, and each SIA round lasts $4$ days. Vaccine wastage (including spillage, cold-chain loss, and open-vial wastage) is $0.10$ per round, assumed to apply to doses procured.\n\nUsing foundational definitions of coverage as the probability of a child being vaccinated in a round, and vaccine efficacy as the probability that vaccination confers immunity in that round, derive the minimum number of SIA rounds required to achieve at least $0.95$ immune coverage. Then, compute:\n- the total number of OPV doses that must be procured across all rounds, accounting for wastage, and\n- the number of vaccination teams required per round to meet the per-round operational coverage.\n\nExpress the final dose quantity as a count of doses and the team requirement as a count of teams.

Let $k$ be the number of rounds. The problem states that the rounds are independent events. For a single child in a single round, the probability of being successfully vaccinated and becoming immune is the product of the coverage probability $r$ and the vaccine efficacy $e$.\n$$P(\\text{immune in one round}) = r \\times e = 0.90 \\times 0.60 = 0.54$$\nThe probability that a child does not become immune in one round is therefore:\n$$P(\\text{not immune in one round}) = 1 - (r \\times e) = 1 - 0.54 = 0.46$$\nAfter $k$ independent rounds, the probability that a child has not become immune is this single-round failure probability raised to the power of $k$.\n$$P(\\text{not immune after } k \\text{ rounds}) = (1 - re)^k = (0.46)^k$$\nThe immune coverage after $k$ rounds, $I_k$, is the complement of this probability.\n$$I_k = 1 - (1 - re)^k$$\nThe objective is to achieve an immune coverage of at least $0.95$.

This is the target coverage $r$ applied to the eligible population $N_{u5}$.\n$$N_{vacc\\_round} = N_{u5} \\times r = 192000 \\times 0.90 = 172800$$\nThis is the number of doses that must be successfully administered in each round.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of doses to be procured. The number of procured doses must account for the wastage rate $W=0.10$. If $D_{round}$ is the number of doses procured for a round, then the number of usable doses is $D_{round} \\times (1 - W)$. This must equal the number of children to be vaccinated.\n$$D_{round} \\times (1 - W) = N_{vacc\\_round}$$\n$$D_{round} = \\frac{N_{vacc\\_round}}{1 - W} = \\frac{172800}{1 - 0.10} = \\frac{172800}{0.90} = 192000$$\nSo, $192000$ doses must be procured for each of the $4$ rounds.\nThe total number of doses to be procured across all rounds is:\n$$D_{total} = k \\times D_{round} = 4 \\times 192000 = 768000$$\n\nFinally, we compute the number of vaccination teams required per round. Each team vaccinates $C_{team\\_day} = 120$ children per day. A round lasts $T_{round} = 4$ days. Therefore, the capacity of one team per round is:\n$$C_{team\\_round} = C_{team\\_day} \\times T_{round} = 120 \\times 4 = 480 \\text{ children per team per round}$$\nThe number of teams required, $T_{teams}$, is the total number of children to be vaccinated per round divided by the capacity of a single team per round.\n$$T_{teams} = \\frac{N_{vacc\\_round}}{C_{team\\_round}} = \\frac{172800}{480} = 360$$\nThus, $360$ teams are required for each of the $4$ rounds.\n\nThe problem asks for a final answer as a row matrix containing two entries: the total number of OPV doses to procure across all rounds, and the number of vaccination teams required per round.\n1.
