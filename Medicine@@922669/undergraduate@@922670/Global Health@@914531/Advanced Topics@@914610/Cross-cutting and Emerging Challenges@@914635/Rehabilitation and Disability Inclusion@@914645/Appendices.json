We will proceed with a solution.\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts as requested: derivation of the general formula, computation of observed densities, and benchmarking against targets.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the General Formula for Workforce Density**\n\nThe core definition of workforce density is the number of workers per unit of population. To account for both full-time and part-time staff, we use the Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) headcount.\n\nLet us define the variables for a specific healthcare cadre:\n- $N_{FT}$ is the number of full-time workers. By definition, each contributes $1$ FTE.\n- $N_{PT}$ is the number of part-time workers.\n- $f_{FTE}$ is the FTE factor for a part-time worker (i.e., the fraction of a full-time workload they perform).\n\nThe total FTE-adjusted headcount for the cadre, denoted as $W_{FTE}$, is the sum of the FTEs from full-time and part-time workers:\n$$W_{FTE} = (N_{FT} \\times 1) + (N_{PT} \\times f_{FTE})$$\n$$W_{FTE} = N_{FT} + N_{PT} \\cdot f_{FTE}$$\n\nLet $P_{total}$ be the total population of the region. The workforce density, $D$, is the total FTE-adjusted headcount divided by the total population:\n$$D = \\frac{W_{FTE}}{P_{total}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the density to be expressed per $k$ population, where $k=10{,}000$. The workforce density per $10{,}000$ population, denoted $D_{10k}$, is therefore:\n$$D_{10k} = D \\times 10{,}000 = \\frac{W_{FTE}}{P_{total}} \\times 10{,}000$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $W_{FTE}$ gives the general formula for cadre-specific workforce density per $10{,}000$ population:\n$$D_{10k} = \\frac{N_{FT} + N_{PT} \\cdot f_{FTE}}{P_{total}} \\times 10{,}000$$\nThis formula explicitly shows how the FTE-adjusted headcount (numerator) and the population denominator enter the expression, scaled by the factor $10{,}000$.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of Observed Workforce Densities**\n\nThe total population is given as $P_{total} = 24{,}600{,}000$.\n\n**Physiotherapists (PT):**\n- Number of full-time workers: $N_{FT, PT} = 1{,}800$\n- Number of part-time workers: $N_{PT, PT} = 660$\n- FTE factor for part-time: $f_{FTE, PT} = 0.5$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total FTE headcount for physiotherapists:\n$$W_{FTE, PT} = 1{,}800 + 660 \\times 0.5 = 1{,}800 + 330 = 2{,}130$$\n\nNext, we compute the observed density per $10{,}000$ population:\n$$D_{10k, PT} = \\frac{2{,}130}{24{,}600{,}000} \\times 10{,}000 = \\frac{21{,}300{,}000}{24{,}600{,}000} = \\frac{213}{246} \\approx 0.865853...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the observed density is $D_{10k, PT} \\approx 0.8659$.\n\n**Occupational Therapists (OT):**\n- Number of full-time workers: $N_{FT, OT} = 400$\n- Number of part-time workers: $N_{PT, OT} = 420$\n- FTE factor for part-time: $f_{FTE, OT} = 0.75$\n\nTotal FTE headcount for occupational therapists:\n$$W_{FTE, OT} = 400 + 420 \\times 0.75 = 400 + 315 = 715$$\n\nObserved density per $10{,}000$ population:\n$$D_{10k, OT} = \\frac{715}{24{,}600{,}000} \\times 10{,}000 = \\frac{7{,}150{,}000}{24{,}600{,}000} = \\frac{715}{2460} \\approx 0.290650...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the observed density is $D_{10k, OT} \\approx 0.2907$.\n\n**Prosthetists-Orthotists (PO):**\n- Number of full-time workers: $N_{FT, PO} = 80$\n- Number of part-time workers: $N_{PT, PO} = 40$\n- FTE factor for part-time: $f_{FTE, PO} = 0.6$\n\nTotal FTE headcount for prosthetists-orthotists:\n$$W_{FTE, PO} = 80 + 40 \\times 0.6 = 80 + 24 = 104$$\n\nObserved density per $10{,}000$ population:\n$$D_{10k, PO} = \\frac{104}{24{,}600{,}000} \\times 10{,}000 = \\frac{1{,}040{,}000}{24{,}600{,}000} = \\frac{104}{2460} \\approx 0.042276...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the observed density is $D_{10k, PO} \\approx 0.04228$.\n\n**Part 3: Benchmarking via Observed-to-Target Ratio**\n\nThe observed-to-target ratio, $R$, is defined as the observed density divided by the target density:\n$$R = \\frac{D_{observed}}{D_{target}}$$\n\n**Physiotherapists (PT):**\n- Observed density: $D_{observed, PT} \\approx 0.865853...$\n- Target density: $D_{target, PT} = 1.5$\n$$R_{PT} = \\frac{0.865853...}{1.5} \\approx 0.577235...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio is $R_{PT} \\approx 0.5772$.\n\n**Occupational Therapists (OT):**\n- Observed density: $D_{observed, OT} \\approx 0.290650...$\n- Target density: $D_{target, OT} = 0.8$\n$$R_{OT} = \\frac{0.290650...}{0.8} \\approx 0.363312...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio is $R_{OT} \\approx 0.3633$.\n\n**Prosthetists-Orthotists (PO):**\n- Observed density: $D_{observed, PO} \\approx 0.042276...$\n- Target density: $D_{target, PO} = 0.2$\n$$R_{PO} = \\frac{0.042276...}{0.2} \\approx 0.211382...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio is $R_{PO} \\approx 0.2114$.\n\nThe final results, rounded to four significant figures, are compiled into a single row matrix as requested.
