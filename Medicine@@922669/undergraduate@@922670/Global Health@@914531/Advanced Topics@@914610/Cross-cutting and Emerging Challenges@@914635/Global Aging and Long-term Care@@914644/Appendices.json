A period life table summarizes the survival and morbidity experience of a hypothetical synthetic cohort exposed, at each age, to the age-specific mortality and morbidity rates observed in a single calendar period. A cohort life table summarizes the experience of a real birth cohort as it moves through time, thus incorporating future improvements or deteriorations in age-specific mortality and morbidity. Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) is the expected sum of person-years lived weighted by the proportion of time spent in a healthy state.\n\nConsider Country X undergoing rapid improvements in old-age mortality. For individuals aged $60$ years today, a period life table built from current age-specific rates implies that the expected person-years lived from ages $60$–$79$ is $16$ years and from ages $80$–$99$ is $5$ years. The proportion of time spent disability-free in these two age bands (as measured in today’s cross-section) is $0.85$ and $0.50$, respectively. Demographers also document sustained trends indicating that by the time this cohort actually reaches ages $60$–$79$ and $80$–$99$, the person-years lived in these bands will be higher by $10\\%$ and $40\\%$, respectively, and the disability-free proportions will improve to $0.90$ and $0.60$, respectively, due to slower growth of chronic morbidity than survival at older ages.\n\nUsing only the definitions above and standard life table reasoning, compute the period HALE at age $60$ and the cohort HALE at age $60$ under the stated trends.

In rapid mortality improvement, period HALE at age $60$ typically underestimates cohort HALE because cohorts will face lower future mortality and somewhat improved morbidity.

Rapid mortality improvement makes period HALE overestimate cohort HALE, leading to chronic overbuilding of LTC capacity if period metrics are used.\n\nD.

A period measure uses data from a single calendar period.\n\nThe given period data for a synthetic cohort starting at age $60$ are:\n- Expected person-years lived from age $60$ to $79$ ($PY_{60-79}^{period}$): $16$ years.\n- Expected person-years lived from age $80$ to $99$ ($PY_{80-99}^{period}$): $5$ years.\n- Proportion of time disability-free in the $60$–$79$ age band ($p_{60-79}^{period}$): $0.85$.\n- Proportion of time disability-free in the $80$–$99$ age band ($p_{80-99}^{period}$): $0.50$.\n\nThe period HALE at age $60$ ($HALE_{60}^{period}$) is the sum of the healthy years lived in each age band:\n$$ HALE_{60}^{period} = (PY_{60-79}^{period} \\times p_{60-79}^{period}) + (PY_{80-99}^{period} \\times p_{80-99}^{period}) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ HALE_{60}^{period} = (16 \\times 0.85) + (5 \\times 0.50) $$\n$$ HALE_{60}^{period} = 13.6 + 2.5 = 16.1 \\text{ years} $$\n\nFor context, let us also calculate the total period life expectancy at age $60$ ($e_{60}^{period}$):\n$$ e_{60}^{period} = PY_{60-79}^{period} + PY_{80-99}^{period} = 16 + 5 = 21 \\text{ years} $$\nThe expected years lived with disability under the period assumption is:\n$$ Disabled \\, Years^{period} = e_{60}^{period} - HALE_{60}^{period} = 21 - 16.1 = 4.9 \\text{ years} $$\n\n**2. Calculation of Cohort HALE at Age 60**\n\nA cohort measure incorporates observed trends to project the future experience of a real birth cohort. The problem provides trends for the cohort of individuals aged $60$ today.\n\nThe cohort-adjusted data are:\n- Person-years lived in $60$–$79$ will be higher by $10\\%$:\n$$ PY_{60-79}^{cohort} = 16 \\times (1 + 0.10) = 17.6 \\text{ years} $$\n- Person-years lived in $80$–$99$ will be higher by $40\\%$:\n$$ PY_{80-99}^{cohort} = 5 \\times (1 + 0.40) = 7.0 \\text{ years} $$\n- Disability-free proportion in $60$–$79$ will improve to $0.90$:\n$$ p_{60-79}^{cohort} = 0.90 $$\n- Disability-free proportion in $80$–$99$ will improve to $0.60$:\n$$ p_{80-99}^{cohort} = 0.60 $$\n\nThe cohort HALE at age $60$ ($HALE_{60}^{cohort}$) is calculated using these projected values:\n$$ HALE_{60}^{cohort} = (PY_{60-79}^{cohort} \\times p_{60-79}^{cohort}) + (PY_{80-99}^{cohort} \\times p_{80-99}^{cohort}) $$\n$$ HALE_{60}^{cohort} = (17.6 \\times 0.90) + (7.0 \\times 0.60) $$\n$$ HALE_{60}^{cohort} = 15.84 + 4.2 = 20.04 \\text{ years} $$\n\nFor context, the total cohort life expectancy at age $60$ ($e_{60}^{cohort}$) is:\n$$ e_{60}^{cohort} = PY_{60-79}^{cohort} + PY_{80-99}^{cohort} = 17.6 + 7.0 = 24.6 \\text{ years} $$\nThe expected years lived with disability for this cohort is:\n$$ Disabled \\, Years^{cohort} = e_{60}^{cohort} - HALE_{60}^{cohort} = 24.6 - 20.04 = 4.56 \\text{ years} $$\n\n**3. Interpretation and Implications**\n\n- **Divergence:** Period HALE ($16.1$ years) significantly underestimates cohort HALE ($20.04$ years). This is because the period measure freezes mortality and morbidity rates at their current levels, failing to capture the substantial future improvements that the real cohort will experience.\n- **Disabled Years per Person:** The period measure projects an average of $4.9$ years of disability per person after age $60$. The cohort measure, which accounts for slower growth in morbidity relative to survival, projects a slightly lower duration of $4.56$ years. This phenomenon, where healthspan increases more than lifespan, is known as \"compression of morbidity.\"\n- **Implications for LTC Capacity:** The crucial point for capacity planning is the total number of people needing care, not just the average duration of disability per person. The period life table, by using today's higher mortality rates, drastically underestimates the number of people who will survive to very old ages. The cohort projection shows a $10\\%$ increase in person-years in the $60$–$79$ band and a massive $40\\%$ increase in the $80$–$99$ band. This implies a much larger future population of the \"oldest old,\" the primary users of LTC. While each survivor may spend a slightly shorter time disabled, the sheer increase in the number of survivors means the total societal need for LTC (i.e., the aggregate number of disabled person-years) will likely increase substantially. Relying on period measures would lead to a severe underestimation of future LTC demand and, consequently, under-investment in capacity.\n\n**4. Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. **In rapid mortality improvement, period HALE at age $60$ typically underestimates cohort HALE because cohorts will face lower future mortality and somewhat improved morbidity. Planners relying on period HALE may overstate disabled years per person but simultaneously underestimate the number of very old survivors; capacity planning should therefore be based on cohort projections of survivors by disability state rather than period snapshots.**\n- The statement that period HALE underestimates cohort HALE is consistent with our calculation ($16.1 < 20.04$). The reason given (lower future mortality and improved morbidity) is correct.\n- The statement that planners using period HALE may overstate disabled years per person is also consistent with our calculation ($4.9 > 4.56$).\n- The statement that period HALE simultaneously leads to an underestimation of the number of very old survivors is the core issue of mortality improvement. The $40\\%$ increase in person-years at ages $80$–$99$ confirms this.\n- The conclusion that planning should be based on cohort projections is the logical imperative.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. **Period and cohort HALE are equal by definition if morbidity trends are stable; thus divergence is impossible, and either measure can be used without bias for LTC capacity planning.**\n- This is incorrect. Even with stable morbidity, HALE would differ if mortality changes. If mortality improves (life expectancy increases), the person-years lived ($PY$) will increase. As long as the health proportion is greater than zero, HALE ($PY \\times p$) will also increase. Thus, cohort HALE would be greater than period HALE due to mortality trends alone.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. **Rapid mortality improvement makes period HALE overestimate cohort HALE, leading to chronic overbuilding of LTC capacity if period metrics are used.**\n- This is incorrect. Our calculation shows period HALE *underestimates* cohort HALE ($16.1 < 20.04$). Consequently, using period metrics would lead to *underbuilding*, not overbuilding, of LTC capacity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. **Period HALE reflects only morbidity and is unaffected by mortality trends, so it cannot diverge from cohort HALE; planners should prefer period HALE for LTC capacity planning even when mortality is changing rapidly.**\n- This is fundamentally incorrect. The definition of HALE (Healthy Life Expectancy) explicitly incorporates mortality through the \"Life Expectancy\" component (person-years lived). Changes in mortality directly affect HALE. Because it is affected by mortality, it will diverge from cohort HALE when mortality trends exist.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe analysis demonstrates that Option A provides the most accurate and complete description of the dynamics between period and cohort measures and their planning implications in a context of rapid mortality improvement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4978449"}]}
