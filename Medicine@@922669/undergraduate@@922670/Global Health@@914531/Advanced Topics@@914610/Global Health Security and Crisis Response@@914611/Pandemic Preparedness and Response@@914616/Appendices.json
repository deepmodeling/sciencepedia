The scenario describes a standard and important task in epidemiology: correcting an observed disease frequency measure for the imperfections of a diagnostic test and quantifying the uncertainty in the corrected estimate. The methods specified—the law of total probability and the Delta method for variance propagation—are appropriate and standard for this context. Therefore, the problem is valid, and I will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe overall task is to first derive the bias-corrected estimator for the true cumulative incidence proportion, $\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{true}}$, and then to derive the variance of this estimator, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{true}})$, using a first-order Delta method.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Bias-Corrected Estimator $\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{true}}$**\n\nLet $p_{\\mathrm{true}}$ be the true cumulative incidence proportion in the population and $p_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ be the proportion of individuals who test positive. Let $D$ denote the event that an individual has the disease and $T+$ denote the event of a positive test result.\nThe definitions provided are:\n-   True cumulative incidence: $p_{\\mathrm{true}} = P(D)$\n-   Observed cumulative incidence: $p_{\\mathrm{obs}} = P(T+)$\n-   Sensitivity: $Se = P(T+ \\mid D)$\n-   Specificity: $Sp = P(T- \\mid D^c)$, where $D^c$ is the complement of $D$. From this, the probability of a false positive is $P(T+ \\mid D^c) = 1 - Sp$.\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can express the probability of an observed positive test, $P(T+)$, in terms of the true incidence and the test characteristics:\n$$P(T+) = P(T+ \\mid D) P(D) + P(T+ \\mid D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the defined parameters into this equation gives:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{obs}} = Se \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{true}} + (1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - p_{\\mathrm{true}})$$\nOur objective is to solve this equation for $p_{\\mathrm{true}}$. We expand the right-hand side:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{obs}} = Se \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{true}} + 1 - Sp - p_{\\mathrm{true}} + Sp \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{true}}$$\nGroup the terms containing $p_{\\mathrm{true}}$:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{obs}} = p_{\\mathrm{true}}(Se + Sp - 1) + 1 - Sp$$\nNow, we isolate $p_{\\mathrm{true}}$:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{obs}} - (1 - Sp) = p_{\\mathrm{true}}(Se + Sp - 1)$$\n$$p_{\\mathrm{obs}} + Sp - 1 = p_{\\mathrm{true}}(Se + Sp - 1)$$\nDividing by the term $(Se + Sp - 1)$, which is guaranteed to be non-zero by the given condition $Se + Sp > 1$, yields the expression for the true incidence proportion:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{true}} = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{obs}} + Sp - 1}{Se + Sp - 1}$$\nThe bias-corrected estimator $\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{true}}$ is obtained by substituting the observed sample proportion $\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ into this formula. The test characteristics $Se$ and $Sp$ are also treated as variables for the subsequent variance calculation. Thus, we define the function $g$:\n$$\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{true}} = g(\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{obs}}, Se, Sp) = \\frac{\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{obs}} + Sp - 1}{Se + Sp - 1}$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Variance of $\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{true}}$**\n\nWe use the first-order multivariate Delta method to approximate the variance of $\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{true}}$.

The public health team wants to infer infection incidence from death counts to quantify case under-ascertainment, using only foundational definitions and well-tested empirical facts. Assume the following scientifically supported elements.\n\n1. Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR) definition: The Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR) is the probability that an infection eventually results in death, denoted by $\\mathrm{IFR}$, and is assumed time-invariant over the short analysis window.\n\n2. Delay structure: Deaths lag infections by the sum of incubation time (infection-to-symptom onset) and onset-to-death time. For the period analyzed, approximate the incubation time as a deterministic delay of $d=4$ days. The symptom onset-to-death time has a discrete probability mass function (PMF) $h(\\delta)$ supported at $\\delta \\in \\{10,14,18\\}$ days, with probabilities $h(10)=0.3$, $h(14)=0.4$, and $h(18)=0.3$. Therefore, the infection-to-death PMF $g(\\tau)$ has support at $\\tau \\in \\{14,18,22\\}$ days with $g(14)=0.3$, $g(18)=0.4$, and $g(22)=0.3$.\n\n3. Short-window growth dynamics: Over the window of interest, infection incidence follows exponential growth with a constant daily rate $r$, so that infections separated by $\\tau$ days satisfy $I_{t-\\tau}$ proportional to $I_t \\exp(-r \\tau)$.\n\nThe surveillance team observes daily deaths and cases as follows. On day $t=40$, the reported deaths are $D_{40}=196$. The daily growth rate is estimated as $r=0.05$ per day. The Infection Fatality Ratio is assessed as $\\mathrm{IFR}=0.008$. The reported cases on day $t=22$ are $C_{22}=2000$.\n\nStarting from the definition of Infection Fatality Ratio and the law of total probability applied to the infection-to-death delay PMF $g(\\tau)$, derive a principled back-calculation expression for $I_t$ in terms of $D_t$, $\\mathrm{IFR}$, $r$, and $g(\\tau)$ under the stated exponential growth assumption.

We proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe primary objective is to estimate the true number of new infections on a given day, $I_t$, by back-calculation from the number of observed deaths, $D_t$. The final goal is to compute the under-ascertainment factor, $U_{22}$, defined as the ratio of estimated true infections to reported cases on day $t=22$, $U_{22} = \\frac{I_{22}}{C_{22}}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between infections and subsequent deaths. The number of deaths observed on day $t$, denoted $D_t$, is the result of infections that occurred on previous days. An infection on day $t-\\tau$ contributes to deaths on day $t$ if the infected individual dies and the time from infection to death is exactly $\\tau$ days. The expected number of deaths on day $t$ is the sum of contributions from all possible prior infection days, weighted by the infection-to-death delay probability mass function (PMF) $g(\\tau)$. Applying the law of total probability, we can write:\n$$D_t = \\sum_{\\tau} I_{t-\\tau} \\cdot \\mathrm{IFR} \\cdot g(\\tau)$$\nwhere $I_{t-\\tau}$ is the number of new infections on day $t-\\tau$, and $\\mathrm{IFR}$ is the Infection Fatality Ratio. Since $\\mathrm{IFR}$ is assumed to be constant, we can factor it out of the summation:\n$$D_t = \\mathrm{IFR} \\sum_{\\tau} I_{t-\\tau} g(\\tau)$$\nThis equation represents a convolution of the infection incidence time series with the delay distribution.\n\nNext, we incorporate the assumption of exponential growth in infection incidence. The number of infections on day $t$ is given by $I(t) = I_0 \\exp(rt)$ for some initial value $I_0$ and a constant daily growth rate $r$. This allows us to relate the number of infections at any two points in time. Specifically, we can express the past incidence $I_{t-\\tau}$ in terms of the incidence on day $t$, $I_t$:\n$$I_{t-\\tau} = I_t \\exp(-r\\tau)$$\nSubstituting this into our equation for $D_t$:\n$$D_t = \\mathrm{IFR} \\sum_{\\tau} \\left(I_t \\exp(-r\\tau)\\right) g(\\tau)$$\nSince $I_t$ is independent of the summation variable $\\tau$, we can factor it out:\n$$D_t = \\mathrm{IFR} \\cdot I_t \\sum_{\\tau} g(\\tau) \\exp(-r\\tau)$$\nThis equation relates the deaths observed on day $t$ to the infections occurring on the same day $t$. We can rearrange this to solve for $I_t$, which yields the requested back-calculation expression:\n$$I_t = \\frac{D_t}{\\mathrm{IFR} \\sum_{\\tau} g(\\tau) \\exp(-r\\tau)}$$\nThe term $\\sum_{\\tau} g(\\tau) \\exp(-r\\tau)$ is the moment-generating function of the delay distribution $g(\\tau)$ evaluated at $-r$. It acts as a correction factor that accounts for the effect of epidemic growth on the delay between infection and death.\n\nTo solve the specific problem, we need to find the number of true infections on day $t=22$, denoted $I_{22}$, using the death count on day $t=40$, which is $D_{40}=196$. We can relate infections on day $22$ to deaths on day $40$ by expressing past infections $I_{40-\\tau}$ in terms of $I_{22}$:\n$$I_{40-\\tau} = I_{22} \\exp(r((40-\\tau) - 22)) = I_{22} \\exp(r(18-\\tau))$$\nSubstituting this into the primary equation for deaths, with $t=40$:\n$$D_{40} = \\mathrm{IFR} \\sum_{\\tau} I_{40-\\tau} g(\\tau) = \\mathrm{IFR} \\sum_{\\tau} \\left(I_{22} \\exp(r(18-\\tau))\\right) g(\\tau)$$\nWe can solve for $I_{22}$:\n$$I_{22} = \\frac{D_{40}}{\\mathrm{IFR} \\sum_{\\tau} g(\\tau) \\exp(r(18-\\tau))}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values.
