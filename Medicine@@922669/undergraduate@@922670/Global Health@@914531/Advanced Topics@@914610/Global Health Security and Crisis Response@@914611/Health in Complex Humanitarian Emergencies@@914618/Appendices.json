Situation monitoring over the last $4$ weeks shows the following: approximately $300{,}000$ persons have been displaced across internal and cross-border routes; routine weekly facility status dashboards indicate that more than $40\\%$ of primary health care facilities are non-functional or closed due to staff flight, supply chain disruption, and direct attacks; and field teams report widespread insecurity, including armed checkpoints and sporadic shelling, that regularly prevents humanitarian teams and civilians from accessing services.

Recent surveys were interrupted.\n*   **Disease Surveillance:** Sentinel surveillance of notifiable diseases is only partially operational.\n*   **Political Context:** The national government is internally divided.\n*   **International Appeal:** No formal international appeal has been issued by the national government.\n*   **Definition of Complex Humanitarian Emergency (CHE):** A severe humanitarian crisis resulting from a breakdown of authority due to conflict or civil strife, characterized by multi-causal drivers and a collapse or severe disruption of essential services, large-scale population displacement, and insecurity that impedes access, typically requiring a multi-sectoral and often international response.\n*   **Role of Crude Mortality Rate (CMR):** The CMR threshold of approximately $1$ death per $10,000$ persons per day is commonly used to flag acute excess mortality but is not, by itself, the sole determinant of whether a crisis is a CHE.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem is to be evaluated for validity.\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is set within the field of global health and humanitarian aid. The definitions, such as that for a CHE, and indicators, like CMR, displacement figures, and health system functionality, are standard and well-established in this field. The scenario described is a realistic representation of an emerging crisis in a conflict-affected region. The problem is scientifically and factually sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a specific definition and a set of observational data. It asks for a classification based on applying the former to the latter. The information is sufficient to perform this classification, and the question is structured to lead to a unique conclusion among the options. The explicit clarification on the role of CMR data prevents ambiguity. The problem is well-posed.\n3.  **Objective:** The language is descriptive and factual, presenting situation reports and established definitions without subjective or emotional loading. The question asks for an objective application of a classification framework.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, or ill-posed. All terms are either commonly understood in the domain or explicitly defined.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to determine if the described situation constitutes a Complex Humanitarian Emergency (CHE) based *only* on the provided definition and evidence.\n\nThe provided definition of a CHE has several key components:\n1.  **Causal Factor:** A breakdown of authority due to conflict or civil strife.\n2.  **Core Characteristics:**\n    a. A collapse or severe disruption of essential services.\n    b. Large-scale population displacement.\n    c. Insecurity that impedes access.\n3.  **Typical Requirement:** A multi-sectoral and often international response.\n\nLet us systematically evaluate the provided evidence against this definition.\n\n1.  **Causal Factor:** The situation occurs in districts \"affected by armed conflict.\" The government is \"internally divided,\" and the health system is collapsing due to \"direct attacks,\" among other reasons. This evidence strongly supports the predicate of a \"breakdown of authority due to conflict or civil strife.\"\n\n2.  **Core Characteristics:**\n    *   **a. Severe disruption of essential services:** The report states that \"more than $40\\%$ of primary health care facilities are non-functional or closed\" due to \"supply chain disruption\" and \"direct attacks.\" The closure of such a large fraction of a critical service like primary health care constitutes a \"severe disruption of essential services.\"\n    *   **b. Large-scale population displacement:** The report indicates \"approximately $300,000$ persons have been displaced.\" A displacement of this magnitude is unambiguously \"large-scale.\"\n    *   **c. Insecurity that impedes access:** The reports mention \"widespread insecurity, including armed checkpoints and sporadic shelling, that regularly prevents humanitarian teams and civilians from accessing services.\" This statement directly and explicitly satisfies the criterion of \"insecurity that impedes access.\"\n\n3.  **Typical Requirement:** The definition notes that a CHE \"typically requir[es]\" an international response. The current situation, with a collapsing health system, large-scale displacement, and a divided national government, clearly points to a need for a response that exceeds national capacity, thereby fitting this description. The absence of a formal *request* for aid does not negate the *need* for it.\n\n**Intermediate Conclusion:** The situation described in the problem statement meets all the core definitional criteria for a Complex Humanitarian Emergency (CHE). The decisive indicators are the multiple, converging pieces of evidence that align directly with the definition: the context of conflict, large-scale displacement, severe service disruption, and access constraints due to insecurity.\n\nThe problem also explicitly states that the CMR threshold of $1$ death per $10,000$ persons per day \"is not, by itself, the sole determinant of whether a crisis is a CHE.\" Therefore, the absence of reliable CMR data does not preclude the classification of the situation as a CHE, especially when other core indicators are so strongly present.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The situation meets CHE criteria; decisive indicators are the scale of displacement (approximately $300,000$ persons), sustained health system dysfunction (weekly closures exceeding $40\\%$), and widespread insecurity constraining access to services and response.**\nThis option correctly concludes that the situation meets the CHE criteria. It also correctly identifies the key pieces of evidence provided in the scenario—displacement, health system disruption, and insecurity impeding access—as the decisive indicators that map directly onto the multi-part definition of a CHE. This aligns perfectly with the derivation above.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The situation does not meet CHE criteria because, without verified CMR exceeding $1/10,000/\\text{day}$, the classification cannot be made regardless of displacement, facility closures, or insecurity.**\nThis option is factually incorrect according to the problem's own framework. The problem explicitly states that the CMR threshold is \"not, by itself, the sole determinant.\" This option incorrectly elevates the CMR criterion to be a necessary condition for classification, which is a direct contradiction of the provided text.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The situation meets CHE criteria, but the only decisive indicator is the number of displaced persons; health facility closures and insecurity are not decisive for classification.**\nThis option correctly concludes that the situation is a CHE but incorrectly minimizes the importance of other indicators. The definition of a CHE is explicitly multi-causal and multi-characteristic, including \"collapse or severe disruption of essential services\" and \"insecurity that impedes access\" as core components on par with displacement. To claim that only displacement is decisive is to ignore the explicit, multi-faceted definition provided.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The situation does not meet CHE criteria because facility closures must exceed $50\\%$ to count as severe health system disruption; closures above $40\\%$ are insufficient.**\nThis option introduces an arbitrary threshold ($50\\%$) that is not mentioned anywhere in the problem statement. The term \"severe disruption\" is not defined by a precise numerical cutoff in the text. Given the context of \"direct attacks\" and \"supply chain disruption,\" the reported closure of \"more than $40\\%$\" of facilities is a sufficiently strong piece of evidence for \"severe disruption.\" This option invents an unsupported rule to invalidate the conclusion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. The situation meets CHE criteria only if a formal international appeal is issued; without a formal request, the classification cannot be applied despite displacement and insecurity.**\nThis option conflates the objective reality of a crisis with the political act of requesting aid. TheCHE definition states that such a crisis \"typically requir[es]\" an international response, describing an inherent characteristic of the situation (i.e., its scale exceeds national capacity), not a procedural prerequisite for its classification. A crisis is defined by the conditions on the ground, not by diplomatic declarations. In fact, the \"internally divided\" government's failure to issue an appeal is further evidence of the \"breakdown of authority\" central to the CHE definition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nThe only option that correctly classifies the situation and accurately identifies the decisive evidence based on the provided framework is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4981264"}, {"introduction": "In humanitarian settings, timely and accurate data is essential for guiding life-saving decisions.

It is scientifically grounded in standard epidemiological and statistical principles for survey design in humanitarian settings, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is stated objectively. The derivation will proceed from first principles as stipulated.\n\nLet $\\rho$ be the true crude mortality rate (CMR) in units of deaths per person-day. The estimator for this rate is given as $\\hat{\\rho} = N/Y$, where $N$ is the observed number of deaths and $Y$ is the total observed person-time in person-days.\n\nFirst, we convert the given rates into the base unit of deaths per person-day.

A key property of the Poisson distribution is that the variance is equal to the mean. The expected number of deaths, $E[N]$, in a sample with total person-time $Y$ is the true rate $\\rho$ multiplied by $Y$.\n$$ E[N] = \\rho Y $$\nTherefore, the variance of the number of deaths is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(N) = E[N] = \\rho Y $$\n\nThe estimator for the rate is $\\hat{\\rho} = N/Y$. Since $Y$ is the total person-time, a quantity fixed by the sample design, we can treat it as a constant when calculating the variance of the estimator $\\hat{\\rho}$.

The margin of error is given by:\n$$ E = z_{0.975} \\times \\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\rho}) $$\nSubstituting the expression for the standard error, we get:\n$$ E = z_{0.975} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mathrm{DEFF} \\times \\rho}{Y}} $$\n\nWe now solve for the person-time $Y$ required to achieve the desired margin of error.

Given a maximum of $m = 25$ households per cluster, the minimum number of clusters, $C$, is $H / m = 2463 / 25 = 98.52$.
