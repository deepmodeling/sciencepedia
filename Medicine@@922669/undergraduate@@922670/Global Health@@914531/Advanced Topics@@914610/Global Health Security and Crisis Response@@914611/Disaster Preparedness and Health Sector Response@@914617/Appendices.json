In the pre-intervention phase, epidemiological assessment estimates the basic reproduction number $R_0$ to be $2.5$.

Assume the population remains approximately fully susceptible during the early weeks of the response, so the fraction susceptible can be taken as constant and equal to $1$ for the purpose of this calculation.\n\nUsing first principles definitions in infectious disease transmission (that is, the basic reproduction number defined in terms of per-contact transmission probability, contact rate, and infectious period), derive how intervention-induced changes in contact rate affect the time-varying reproduction number $R_t$ under the stated assumptions. Then compute the numerical value of $R_t$ after the NPI is implemented and briefly interpret in words whether the outbreak is expected to grow or decline under these conditions. Report $R_t$ as a dimensionless number. No rounding is necessary.", "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded in the principles of infectious disease epidemiology. All necessary data and assumptions are provided for a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe basic reproduction number, $R_0$, is a fundamental concept in epidemiology that represents the average number of secondary infections produced by a single infected individual in a completely susceptible population, in the absence of any interventions or pre-existing immunity. By first principles, it is defined as the product of three factors:\n$$R_0 = \\tau \\times c \\times d$$\nwhere:\n- $\\tau$ is the per-contact probability of transmission between an infectious individual and a susceptible individual.\n- $c$ is the average rate of effective contacts per unit time for an infectious individual.\n- $d$ is the average duration of the infectious period.\n\nThe problem states an initial basic reproduction number of $R_0 = 2.5$. Let us denote the initial, pre-intervention contact rate as $c_0$. Thus, we have:\n$$R_0 = \\tau \\times c_0 \\times d = 2.5$$\n\nThe time-varying reproduction number, $R_t$, accounts for changes in conditions over time, such as the implementation of control measures or the depletion of susceptible individuals. A general expression for $R_t$ is:\n$$R_t = \\tau \\times c(t) \\times d \\times \\frac{S(t)}{N}$$\nwhere $c(t)$ is the time-dependent contact rate and $\\frac{S(t)}{N}$ is the fraction of the population that is susceptible at time $t$.\n\nThe problem provides two key pieces of information to determine the post-intervention $R_t$.\nFirst, it is specified that the outbreak is in its early phase and the population can be assumed to be fully susceptible. This translates to the mathematical assumption:\n$$\\frac{S(t)}{N} \\approx 1$$\nThis simplifies the expression for $R_t$ to be dependent only on changes in the transmission parameters, not on population immunity.\n$$R_t \\approx \\tau \\times c(t) \\times d$$\n\nSecond, the Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) are designed to reduce the average number of effective daily contacts per person by $40\\%$. Let us denote the new, post-intervention contact rate as $c_1$. This reduction can be expressed as:\n$$c_1 = c_0 \\times (1 - 0.40) = 0.60 \\times c_0$$\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the reproduction number under the NPIs, which we will call $R_t$. It is calculated using the new contact rate $c_1$, while $\\tau$ and $d$ are assumed to remain unchanged.\n$$R_t = \\tau \\times c_1 \\times d$$\n\nTo derive how $R_t$ relates to the initial $R_0$, we substitute the expression for $c_1$ into the equation for $R_t$:\n$$R_t = \\tau \\times (0.60 \\times c_0) \\times d$$\nBy rearranging the terms, we can see the relationship explicitly:\n$$R_t = 0.60 \\times (\\tau \\times c_0 \\times d)$$\nRecognizing that the term in the parenthesis is the definition of the pre-intervention $R_0$, we arrive at the general relationship between the pre- and post-intervention reproduction numbers under a contact-reducing intervention:\n$$R_t = 0.60 \\times R_0$$\nThis equation formally shows that a proportional reduction in the contact rate leads to the same proportional reduction in the reproduction number, given that other factors remain constant.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $R_t$ using the given value for $R_0$:\n$$R_t = 0.60 \\times 2.5$$\n$$R_t = \\frac{6}{10} \\times \\frac{25}{10} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}$$\n$$R_t = 1.5$$\n\nThe resulting time-varying reproduction number after the NPIs are implemented is $R_t = 1.5$.\n\nFor the interpretation, the value of $R_t$ indicates the expected trajectory of the outbreak. If $R_t > 1$, each infected individual, on average, infects more than one other person, leading to exponential growth in the number of cases. If $R_t < 1$, the outbreak is in decline. If $R_t = 1$, the number of new cases is stable. Since the calculated value is $R_t = 1.5$, which is greater than $1$, the outbreak is expected to continue to grow. However, the interventions have successfully reduced the rate of growth, as the reproduction number has been lowered from $2.5$ to $1.5$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.5}\n$$", "id": "4974248"}, {"introduction": "Beyond controlling transmission, disaster response is a matter of logistics and resource management.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires a two-part analysis. First, we determine the total oxygen demand to establish the scale of the need. Second, we calculate the maximum allowable interval between resupplies given the hospital's storage constraints.\n\nLet's begin by calculating the total oxygen consumption rate for all patients.\nThe total oxygen flow rate, $\\dot{V}_{total}$, is the product of the number of patients, $N_p$, and the flow rate per patient, $\\dot{V}_p$.\n$$ \\dot{V}_{total} = N_p \\times \\dot{V}_p $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\dot{V}_{total} = 30 \\times 15\\,\\mathrm{L\\,min^{-1}} = 450\\,\\mathrm{L\\,min^{-1}} $$\nTo facilitate calculations with the surge duration given in hours, we convert this rate to liters per hour ($\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}$):\n$$ \\dot{V}_{total} = 450\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{min}} \\times 60\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{min}}{\\mathrm{h}} = 27000\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the total volume of oxygen, $V_{demand}$, required over the entire $12\\,\\mathrm{h}$ surge duration, $T_{surge}$.\n$$ V_{demand} = \\dot{V}_{total} \\times T_{surge} $$\n$$ V_{demand} = 27000\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} \\times 12\\,\\mathrm{h} = 324000\\,\\mathrm{L} $$\n\nTo determine the minimum integer number of cylinders, $N_{req}$, needed to meet this total demand without any resupply, we divide the total demand volume by the usable volume per cylinder, $V_c$, and take the ceiling of the result, as a partial cylinder cannot be procured.\n$$ N_{req} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{V_{demand}}{V_c} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{324000\\,\\mathrm{L}}{6800\\,\\mathrm{L}} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{3240}{68} \\right\\rceil = \\lceil 47.647... \\rceil = 48 $$\nThis confirms that the hospital's maximum onsite storage of $N_{max} = 24$ cylinders is insufficient to cover the entire surge, necessitating at least one resupply.\n\nNow we address the main question: determining the longest possible equal interval between resupply arrivals, let's call it $T_{interval}$. The hospital starts with a full inventory of $N_{max} = 24$ cylinders. This corresponds to an initial total volume of available oxygen, $V_{initial}$.\n$$ V_{initial} = N_{max} \\times V_c = 24 \\times 6800\\,\\mathrm{L} = 163200\\,\\mathrm{L} $$\nOxygen is consumed at the constant rate $\\dot{V}_{total}$. A stockout is avoided if, at the time of each resupply, the inventory has not been fully depleted. The longest possible interval between resupplies is therefore the time it takes to consume the entire starting inventory of a fully stocked facility. Any interval longer than this would result in a period of zero oxygen before the resupply truck arrives.\n\nWe can find this maximum interval by setting the volume consumed during $T_{interval}$ equal to the initial volume $V_{initial}$:\n$$ \\dot{V}_{total} \\times T_{interval} = V_{initial} $$\nSolving for $T_{interval}$:\n$$ T_{interval} = \\frac{V_{initial}}{\\dot{V}_{total}} = \\frac{N_{max} \\times V_c}{N_p \\times \\dot{V}_p} $$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ T_{interval} = \\frac{163200\\,\\mathrm{L}}{27000\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}} = \\frac{1632}{270}\\,\\mathrm{h} = \\frac{272}{45}\\,\\mathrm{h} $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ T_{interval} \\approx 6.0444...\\,\\mathrm{h} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ T_{interval} \\approx 6.04\\,\\mathrm{h} $$\nThis interval is less than the total surge duration of $12\\,\\mathrm{h}$. A resupply would occur at approximately $6.04\\,\\mathrm{h}$, at which point the inventory is instantaneously restocked to $24$ cylinders. This new stock is sufficient to last for another $6.04\\,\\mathrm{h}$, which is longer than the remaining surge duration of $12\\,\\mathrm{h} - 6.04\\,\\mathrm{h} = 5.96\\,\\mathrm{h}$. Therefore, this resupply strategy prevents any stockout during the $12\\,\\mathrm{h}$ period.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.04}$$", "id": "4974278"}, {"introduction": "After a disaster strikes, how do we measure a health system's ability to absorb the shock and recover?

The goal is to quantify service continuity and recovery using a resilience index grounded in first principles of health system performance in shocks, and then reason about which capacity likely constrained recovery.\n\nFundamental base and assumptions:\n- In stable periods, expected outpatient volume is approximated by the sample mean of pre-shock months; this follows the definition of the mean as an unbiased estimator of the expected value under stationarity.\n- Health system resilience in service delivery can be operationalized as the ability to maintain potential throughput during a defined shock-recovery window.
