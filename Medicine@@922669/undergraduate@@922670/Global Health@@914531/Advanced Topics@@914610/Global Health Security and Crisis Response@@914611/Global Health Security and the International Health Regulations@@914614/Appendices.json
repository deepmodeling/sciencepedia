The problem states the probability of this event, which represents the sampling coverage, is:\n$$ P(S) = q $$\n\nLet $T$ be the event that the diagnostic assay yields a positive result. The problem specifies the sensitivity of the assay, $s$, as the probability of a true positive result conditional on a specimen being obtained from a truly infected individual. This can be written as:\n$$ P(T | S) = s $$\n\nAn individual is considered \"detected\" by the surveillance system if and only if a specimen is obtained from them AND the subsequent assay yields a positive result. Let $D$ be the event of detection for this single individual. The event $D$ is the intersection of events $S$ and $T$.

For each trial (i.e., for each individual $i = 1, 2, \\dots, n$), there are two possible outcomes:\n1.  **Success**: The individual is detected. This occurs with probability $p = sq$.\n2.  **Failure**: The individual is not detected.

Let $D_{outbreak}$ be the event that the outbreak is detected. This corresponds to having at least one \"success\" in the $n$ Bernoulli trials.\n\nCalculating the probability of \"at least one\" success directly would involve summing the probabilities of exactly $1$ success, exactly $2$ successes, and so on, up to $n$ successes. A more direct method, as suggested by the problem, is to use the rule of complement events.\n\nThe complement of the event $D_{outbreak}$ is the event that the outbreak is not detected, which we denote as $D_{outbreak}^c$. The outbreak is not detected if and only if there are zero detections among all $n$ individuals. This means that for every one of the $n$ individuals, the outcome of the Bernoulli trial is a \"failure\".\n\nThe probability of failure for a single trial (i.e., one individual not being detected) is $1 - sq$.\n\nSince the trials for all $n$ individuals are independent, the probability that all $n$ trials result in failure is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$ P(D_{outbreak}^c) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(\\text{individual } i \\text{ is not detected}) $$\n$$ P(D_{outbreak}^c) = (1 - sq)^n $$\n\nThe probability of the event $D_{outbreak}$ is $1$ minus the probability of its complement, $D_{outbreak}^c$.\n$$ P(D_{outbreak}) = 1 - P(D_{outbreak}^c) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(D_{outbreak}^c)$, we arrive at the final expression for the probability of detecting the outbreak:\n$$ P(D_{outbreak}) = 1 - (1 - sq)^n $$\n\nThis expression gives the probability of outbreak detection as a function of the number of infected individuals, $n$, the sampling coverage, $q$, and the assay sensitivity, $s$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1 - (1 - sq)^{n}}\n$$", "id": "4979160"}, {"introduction": "Once an outbreak is detected in one country, a primary concern under the IHR is the risk of its international spread.

Let $N(t)$ be the random variable representing the number of infectious travelers arriving in a time interval of length $t$ days. The probability of observing exactly $k$ arrivals in this interval is given by the Poisson probability mass function (PMF):\n$$P(N(t) = k) = \\frac{(\\lambda t)^k \\exp(-\\lambda t)}{k!}$$\nwhere $k$ can be any non-negative integer ($k=0, 1, 2, \\dots$) and the mean number of arrivals in the interval is $\\lambda t$.\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least one infectious traveler arrives during the time window of length $t$.

The complement of the event \"at least one arrival\" ($N(t) \\ge 1$) is the event \"zero arrivals\" ($N(t) = 0$). The sum of the probabilities of an event and its complement is $1$. Therefore:\n$$P(N(t) \\ge 1) = 1 - P(N(t) = 0)$$\nWe find the probability of zero arrivals by substituting $k=0$ into the Poisson PMF:\n$$P(N(t) = 0) = \\frac{(\\lambda t)^0 \\exp(-\\lambda t)}{0!}$$\nUsing the mathematical definitions $(\\lambda t)^0 = 1$ (for $\\lambda t \\neq 0$) and $0! = 1$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$P(N(t) = 0) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\nSubstituting this result back into the equation for the complementary event, we obtain the desired probability:\n$$P(N(t) \\ge 1) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\n\nNext, we relate the arrival rate $\\lambda$ to the given observable quantities: $R$, the average number of incoming passengers per day; $p$, the point prevalence of being infectious; and $s$, the fraction of infectious travelers prevented from entry by screening.\nThe parameter $\\lambda$ represents the average rate of *successful* importations of infectious individuals per day. We can construct this rate step-by-step.\nThe average number of infectious individuals among the total daily passengers $R$, before any screening, is given by the product of the passenger volume and the prevalence:\n$$\\text{Average infectious passengers per day} = R \\times p$$\nScreening measures prevent a fraction $s$ of these infectious passengers from entering. This implies that the remaining fraction, $(1-s)$, successfully passes through screening and enters the country.\nTherefore, the rate $\\lambda$ of infectious travelers successfully entering the country per day is the product of the average number of infectious passengers and the fraction that evades screening:\n$$\\lambda = (R \\times p) \\times (1-s)$$\nThis expression is valid under the standard assumptions for a Poisson process: the events (each successful importation) are independent and occur at a constant average rate, which holds when the probability of an individual passenger being an event, $p(1-s)$, is very small.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of the probability of at least one arrival within a window of $t = 30$ days, using the parameter values $R = 1000$ passengers/day, $p = 5 \\times 10^{-5}$, and $s = 0.6$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the rate $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = 1000 \\times (5 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times (1 - 0.6)$$\n$$\\lambda = 10^3 \\times 5 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 0.4$$\n$$\\lambda = 5 \\times 10^{-2} \\times 0.4 = 0.05 \\times 0.4 = 0.02$$\nThe rate of successful importations is $\\lambda = 0.02$ per day.\n\nNow, we use this rate and the time window $t = 30$ days to calculate the probability $P(N(30) \\ge 1)$:\n$$P(N(30) \\ge 1) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t) = 1 - \\exp(-0.02 \\times 30)$$\n$$P(N(30) \\ge 1) = 1 - \\exp(-0.6)$$\nWe compute the numerical value:\n$$\\exp(-0.6) \\approx 0.548811636$$\n$$P(N(30) \\ge 1) \\approx 1 - 0.548811636 = 0.451188364$$\nThe problem requires rounding the result to four significant figures.
