Two mutually exclusive options are on the table: maintain the current program (Intervention 1) or fund an advocacy-driven scale-up (Intervention 2). Political negotiations within the consortium have set a cost-effectiveness threshold based on willingness-to-pay per health gain. Costs are borne in United States Dollar (USD), and health outcomes are measured in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) averted.\n\nIntervention 1 has total cost $C_{1} = 8.0 \\times 10^{6}$ USD and a projected outcome of $E_{1} = 1.20 \\times 10^{4}$ DALY averted.

The goal is to determine which intervention should be funded based on affordability and an incremental cost-effectiveness comparison against a specified willingness-to-pay threshold.\n\nThe provided data are as follows:\n- Intervention 1: Cost $C_{1} = 8.0 \\times 10^{6}$ USD, Effectiveness $E_{1} = 1.20 \\times 10^{4}$ DALYs averted.\n- Intervention 2: Cost $C_{2} = 1.15 \\times 10^{7}$ USD, Effectiveness $E_{2} = 1.66 \\times 10^{4}$ DALYs averted.\n- Budget Constraint: $B = 1.20 \\times 10^{7}$ USD.\n- Cost-Effectiveness Threshold: $\\lambda = 1.00 \\times 10^{3}$ USD per DALY averted.\n\nFirst, we analyze the options. Intervention $2$ is more effective than Intervention $1$ since $E_{2} > E_{1}$ ($1.66 \\times 10^{4} > 1.20 \\times 10^{4}$). However, it is also more costly, as $C_{2} > C_{1}$ ($1.15 \\times 10^{7} > 8.0 \\times 10^{6}$). This is a standard scenario for an incremental analysis. Neither intervention dominates the other (i.e., one is not both more effective and less costly).\n\nThe problem defines the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as the ratio of the difference in costs to the difference in outcomes. For Intervention $2$ compared to Intervention $1$, the ICER is given by:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{C_{2} - C_{1}}{E_{2} - E_{1}}\n$$\n\nWe calculate the incremental cost, $\\Delta C$, and the incremental effectiveness, $\\Delta E$:\n$$\n\\Delta C = C_{2} - C_{1} = (1.15 \\times 10^{7}) - (8.0 \\times 10^{6}) = 11.5 \\times 10^{6} - 8.0 \\times 10^{6} = 3.5 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ USD}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_{2} - E_{1} = (1.66 \\times 10^{4}) - (1.20 \\times 10^{4}) = 0.46 \\times 10^{4} \\text{ DALYs averted} = 4600 \\text{ DALYs averted}\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the ICER:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{3.5 \\times 10^{6}}{4600} = \\frac{3,500,000}{4600} \\approx 760.869565... \\text{ USD per DALY averted}\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding this value to three significant figures. The first three significant digits are $7$, $6$, and $0$. The fourth digit is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the third digit.\n$$\n\\text{ICER} \\approx 761 \\text{ USD per DALY averted}\n$$\n\nNext, we must apply the decision rule. The decision framework for two mutually exclusive interventions requires checking two conditions: affordability and cost-effectiveness.\n\n1.  **Affordability**: Both interventions must have costs within the budget constraint, $B$.\n    - For Intervention $1$: $C_{1} = 8.0 \\times 10^{6}$ USD. Since $8.0 \\times 10^{6}  1.20 \\times 10^{7}$, Intervention $1$ is affordable.\n    - For Intervention $2$: $C_{2} = 1.15 \\times 10^{7}$ USD. Since $1.15 \\times 10^{7}  1.20 \\times 10^{7}$, Intervention $2$ is also affordable.\n    Since both options are affordable, the budget constraint does not exclude either choice.\n\n2.  **Cost-Effectiveness**: The ICER is compared to the willingness-to-pay threshold, $\\lambda$. The ICER represents the additional cost per additional unit of health gain achieved by choosing the more expensive intervention (Intervention $2$) over the less expensive one (Intervention $1$). The threshold $\\lambda$ represents the maximum price the consortium is willing to pay for an additional unit of health gain.\n    - If ICER $\\le \\lambda$, the additional health gain is considered worth the additional cost. The more effective intervention (Intervention $2$) should be chosen.\n    - If ICER $> \\lambda$, the additional health gain is not considered worth the additional cost. The less expensive intervention (Intervention $1$) should be chosen.\n\nIn this case:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} \\approx 761 \\text{ USD per DALY averted}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda = 1.00 \\times 10^{3} = 1000 \\text{ USD per DALY averted}\n$$\nSince $761 \\le 1000$, the condition ICER $\\le \\lambda$ is satisfied. This indicates that the incremental benefit of Intervention $2$ is cost-effective according to the consortium's criteria.\n\nGiven that Intervention $2$ is affordable and the switch from Intervention $1$ to Intervention $2$ is cost-effective, the consortium should fund Intervention $2$.\n\nThe problem defines a funding priority indicator, $p$, such that $p=1$ if Intervention $2$ should be funded and $p=0$ if Intervention $1$ should be funded. Based on our analysis, Intervention $2$ should be funded. Therefore, $p=1$.\n\nThe final answer requires a row matrix containing the rounded ICER and the value of $p$.\nThe ICER rounded to three significant figures is $761$.\nThe funding priority indicator $p$ is $1$.\n\nThe final result is the ordered pair $(761, 1)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 761  1 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "5004384"}, {"introduction": "The launch of a new, well-funded health program can seem like an unqualified victory, but what are the hidden costs? This exercise explores the critical concept of opportunity cost, revealing how vertical, disease-focused initiatives can unintentionally pull resources away from other essential services within a health system. You will calculate the real-world trade-offs of a new program and are challenged to devise a \"diagonal\" solution—a sophisticated approach that uses targeted funds to strengthen the entire system [@problem_id:5004393].", "problem": "A district primary health center manages multiple services through a fixed nursing workforce. The center has $14$ full-time nurses, each working $40$ hours per week, so the baseline weekly nurse-hour budget is fixed. Baseline time allocation is governed by the center’s operational policy and is currently: administration $0.10$ of total nurse hours (protected and not subject to reallocation), maternal health services (antenatal, postnatal, and related care) $0.30$, general outpatient care $0.45$, and community outreach $0.15$. A new Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) program is introduced that requires an additional $0.20$ of the baseline total weekly nurse-hour budget to be devoted to HIV activities. No overtime or new hires are permitted during the first implementation phase, and administrative time remains protected. The center’s policy states that any required reallocation of nurse hours must be distributed proportionally across all non-protected service categories (maternal health services, general outpatient care, and community outreach) based on their baseline shares.\n\nAssume that a maternal health visit, including clinical tasks and documentation, requires on average $0.5$ hours of nurse time. Using the standard time-budget constraint and the definition of opportunity cost as the forgone output in the next-best use when a resource is reallocated, compute the weekly number of maternal health visits that will be forgone due to the reallocation required by the HIV program. Express your answer in visits per week and round your final numerical result to four significant figures.\n\nThen, briefly propose a mitigation plan consistent with a diagonal approach (using targeted vertical program resources to strengthen cross-cutting health system functions) that could reduce the calculated opportunity cost without reducing total HIV service coverage. Your mitigation proposal does not need to be quantified, but it must be operationally plausible within the described constraints.", "solution": "Let $N$ be the total number of full-time nurses, and let $H$ be the number of hours each nurse works per week. The total weekly nurse-hour budget, $T$, is given by:\n$$T = N \\times H$$\nGiven $N = 14$ and $H = 40$ hours/week, the total budget is:\n$$T = 14 \\times 40 = 560 \\text{ hours/week}$$\n\nThe baseline allocation of these hours is given by a set of fractions of the total budget $T$. Let these fractions be:\n- $f_{admin} = 0.10$ for administration\n- $f_{mhs} = 0.30$ for maternal health services\n- $f_{opc} = 0.45$ for general outpatient care\n- $f_{co} = 0.15$ for community outreach\n\nThe sum of these fractions is $0.10 + 0.30 + 0.45 + 0.15 = 1.00$, which accounts for the entire budget.\n\nA new HIV program requires an allocation of $f_{hiv} = 0.20$ of the baseline total weekly nurse-hour budget. The hours required for the HIV program, $T_{hiv}$, are:\n$$T_{hiv} = f_{hiv} \\times T = 0.20 \\times 560 = 112 \\text{ hours}$$\n\nThese hours must be reallocated from existing services. The problem states that administrative time is protected, so the reallocation must come from the non-protected service categories: maternal health services (MHS), general outpatient care (OPC), and community outreach (CO).\n\nThe total fraction of time allocated to non-protected services is:\n$$f_{non-prot} = f_{mhs} + f_{opc} + f_{co} = 0.30 + 0.45 + 0.15 = 0.90$$\nThe total hours allocated to these services is:\n$$T_{non-prot} = f_{non-prot} \\times T = 0.90 \\times 560 = 504 \\text{ hours}$$\n\nThe reallocation is to be distributed proportionally across these non-protected services. This means the reduction in hours from each service will be proportional to its share of the total non-protected time. The share of maternal health services within the non-protected pool, $P_{mhs}$, is:\n$$P_{mhs} = \\frac{f_{mhs}}{f_{non-prot}} = \\frac{0.30}{0.90} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nThe reduction in hours for maternal health services, $\\Delta T_{mhs}$, is this proportion applied to the total hours required for the HIV program:\n$$\\Delta T_{mhs} = P_{mhs} \\times T_{hiv} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 112 = \\frac{112}{3} \\text{ hours}$$\n\nThe opportunity cost is defined as the forgone output. In this case, it is the number of maternal health visits that will no longer be possible. Given that one maternal health visit requires $t_{visit} = 0.5$ hours of nurse time, the weekly number of forgone visits, $V_{forgone}$, is:\n$$V_{forgone} = \\frac{\\Delta T_{mhs}}{t_{visit}} = \\frac{112/3}{0.5} = \\frac{112/3}{1/2} = \\frac{112 \\times 2}{3} = \\frac{224}{3}$$\n\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$V_{forgone} = 74.666... \\text{ visits/week}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required yields $74.67$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for a mitigation plan consistent with a diagonal approach. A diagonal approach leverages resources from a vertical (disease-specific) program, like HIV, to strengthen horizontal (cross-cutting) health system functions, thereby benefiting other services. The goal is to reduce the calculated opportunity cost for maternal health services without compromising the new HIV service coverage.\n\nA plausible mitigation plan involves integrating services and implementing task-shifting, funded or facilitated by the new HIV program's resources.\n1.  **Integrated Service Delivery**: The HIV program's focus on prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) offers a natural point of integration with maternal health services (MHS). Instead of separate visits, workflows can be redesigned so that a single patient encounter provides both standard antenatal care and HIV testing, counseling, and treatment initiation. This streamlining reduces total nurse time per pregnant woman by eliminating redundant steps like separate patient registration, vital sign measurements, and charting. The vertical HIV program's resources could fund the initial process redesign and training.\n2.  **Task-Shifting and Task-Sharing**: The HIV program can support the training of lower-cadre health workers (e.g., community health workers or medical assistants) to take over non-clinical or less complex clinical tasks currently performed by nurses. These tasks might include patient education, adherence counseling, appointment scheduling, and basic health record management for both MHS and HIV clients. By offloading these duties, the remaining, more limited, nurse time for MHS can be dedicated exclusively to higher-level clinical functions. This increases the efficiency of each nurse-hour, allowing more visits to be conducted within the reduced time allocation and thus mitigating the opportunity cost.\n\nThis combined strategy uses the targeted HIV resources to build system-wide capacity (integrated workflows, a more flexible workforce), which is the definition of a diagonal approach. It directly addresses the constraint of limited nurse time by making that time more productive, thereby reducing the number of forgone MHS visits.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{74.67}$$", "id": "5004393"}, {"introduction": "Effective global health action, like stopping a pandemic, requires countries to cooperate.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for two results: first, the Nash equilibrium of a game representing a global health scenario, and second, the minimum side payment required to make mutual reporting a Nash equilibrium.\n\nPart 1: Analysis of the initial game.\n\nLet the two states be Player $A$ and Player $B$. Each player has a set of strategies $S = \\{R, C\\}$, where $R$ stands for Report and $C$ for Conceal. The payoffs are given by the matrix:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n  R  C \\\\\n\\hline\nR  (5,5)  (0,6) \\\\\nC  (6,0)  (1,1)\n\\end{array}\n$$\nA Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile where no player can unilaterally change their strategy to achieve a better payoff. We can identify the Nash equilibrium by analyzing each player's best response to the other's possible actions.\n\nLet's analyze Player $A$'s best responses:\n- If Player $B$ chooses $R$, Player $A$'s payoff is $5$ for choosing $R$ and $6$ for choosing $C$. Since $6 > 5$, Player $A$'s best response is $C$.\n- If Player $B$ chooses $C$, Player $A$'s payoff is $0$ for choosing $R$ and $1$ for choosing $C$. Since $1 > 0$, Player $A$'s best response is $C$.\n\nIn both cases, Player $A$'s best response is to choose $C$. This means that $C$ is a strictly dominant strategy for Player $A$.\n\nNow, let's analyze Player $B$'s best responses. The game is symmetric, so the analysis is identical:\n- If Player $A$ chooses $R$, Player $B$'s payoff is $5$ for choosing $R$ and $6$ for choosing $C$. Since $6 > 5$, Player $B$'s best response is $C$.\n- If Player $A$ chooses $C$, Player $B$'s payoff is $0$ for choosing $R$ and $1$ for choosing $C$. Since $1 > 0$, Player $B$'s best response is $C$.\n\nSimilarly, $C$ is a strictly dominant strategy for Player $B$.\n\nThe unique Nash equilibrium of a game where both players have a strictly dominant strategy is the profile where both play that strategy. Therefore, the unique Nash equilibrium of this game is $(C, C)$. This strategic structure, where individual rationality leads to a collectively suboptimal outcome (payoff of $(1,1)$ instead of the possible $(5,5)$), is characteristic of a Prisoner's Dilemma.\n\nPart 2: Analysis of the game with the side payment.\n\nA Global Health Insurance Fund (GHIF) introduces a side payment of $t$ billions of dollars to any state that chooses to Report ($R$). This modifies the original payoff matrix. The new payoff for a player is their original payoff plus $t$ if they choose $R$, and their original payoff if they choose $C$.\n\nLet's denote the new payoff matrix as $U'$. The payoffs are adjusted as follows:\n- For $(R,R)$, both players report, so both receive the payment $t$. The new payoff is $(5+t, 5+t)$.\n- For $(R,C)$, Player $A$ reports and receives $t$, while Player $B$ does not. The new payoff is $(0+t, 6) = (t, 6)$.\n- For $(C,R)$, Player $B$ reports and receives $t$, while Player $A$ does not. The new payoff is $(6, 0+t) = (6, t)$.\n- For $(C,C)$, neither player reports, so neither receives the payment. The payoff remains $(1,1)$.\n\nThe modified payoff matrix $U'$ is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n  R  C \\\\\n\\hline\nR  (5+t, 5+t)  (t, 6) \\\\\nC  (6, t)  (1, 1)\n\\end{array}\n$$\nWe want to find the minimum value of $t$ for which $(R,R)$ becomes a Nash equilibrium. For $(R,R)$ to be a Nash equilibrium, no player must have an incentive to unilaterally deviate from this strategy profile.\n\nLet's check the condition for Player $A$. If the strategy profile is $(R,R)$, Player $A$'s payoff is $5+t$. If Player $A$ unilaterally deviates to $C$, the profile becomes $(C,R)$, and Player $A$'s payoff would be $6$. For $(R,R)$ to be a Nash equilibrium, Player $A$'s payoff from playing $R$ must be greater than or equal to the payoff from deviating to $C$.\n$$\n\\text{Payoff}_A(R,R) \\geq \\text{Payoff}_A(C,R)\n$$\n$$\n5 + t \\geq 6\n$$\nSolving for $t$, we get:\n$$\nt \\geq 6 - 5\n$$\n$$\nt \\geq 1\n$$\nNow, let's check the condition for Player $B$. Due to the symmetry of the game, the condition will be identical. If the strategy profile is $(R,R)$, Player $B$'s payoff is $5+t$. If Player $B$ unilaterally deviates to $C$, the profile becomes $(R,C)$, and Player $B$'s payoff would be $6$.

The problem asks for the minimum value of $t$ that ensures $(R,R)$ is a Nash equilibrium. This corresponds to the smallest value of $t$ that fulfills the inequality.\nThe minimum value is therefore $t=1$.
