A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the calculation of the unit cost of a delivered vaccine dose. The solution proceeds by applying the definitions provided in the problem statement.\n\nLet $C_{T}$ represent the total economic cost of the campaign. According to the problem's definition, the total cost is the sum of fixed and variable costs.\nLet $C_{F}$ be the total fixed cost and $C_{V}$ be the total variable cost.\n$$C_{T} = C_{F} + C_{V}$$\n\nThe fixed overhead cost, $F$, is given as $10,000$ USD. This cost does not change with the number of doses delivered. Therefore,\n$$C_{F} = F = \\$10,000$$\n\nThe variable cost per dose, $v$, is given as $3$ USD. The problem states that variable costs scale linearly with the number of doses delivered, $N$. The total variable cost, $C_V$, is the product of the variable cost per dose and the total number of doses.\n$$C_{V} = v \\times N$$\nWith $v = 3$ USD/dose and $N = 5,000$ doses, the total variable cost is:\n$$C_{V} = \\$3 \\times 5,000 = \\$15,000$$\n\nNow, the total economic cost, $C_{T}$, can be calculated:\n$$C_{T} = C_{F} + C_{V} = \\$10,000 + \\$15,000 = \\$25,000$$\n\nThe problem asks for the unit cost, which we will denote as $U$. The unit cost is defined as the total cost divided by the number of doses delivered.\n$$U = \\frac{C_{T}}{N}$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated total cost and the given number of doses:\n$$U = \\frac{\\$25,000}{5,000 \\text{ doses}}$$\n$$U = 5 \\text{ USD per dose}$$\n\nAlternatively, we can first derive a general symbolic expression for the unit cost, $U$.\n$$U = \\frac{C_{T}}{N} = \\frac{C_{F} + C_{V}}{N} = \\frac{F + v \\times N}{N}$$\nThis expression can be separated into two terms:\n$$U = \\frac{F}{N} + \\frac{v \\times N}{N} = \\frac{F}{N} + v$$\nThis final symbolic expression represents the unit cost as the sum of the average fixed cost (total fixed cost spread over all units) and the variable cost per unit.\n\nSubstituting the given values into this symbolic expression:\n- $F = 10,000$\n- $v = 3$\n- $N = 5,000$\n\n$$U = \\frac{10,000}{5,000} + 3$$\n$$U = 2 + 3$$\n$$U = 5$$\nThe final answer is $5$ USD per dose. The result is consistent across both calculation methods.

It provides a complete and consistent set of data and definitions from the field of health economic evaluation, specifically cost-effectiveness analysis. The problem is valid and permits a formal solution.\n\nThe task is to compute the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of Treatment A versus Treatment B and to determine if Treatment A is cost-effective relative to Treatment B based on a given willingness-to-pay threshold.\n\nFirst, we identify and define the given parameters:\n- Cost of Treatment A, $C_A = \\$1,500$.\n- Effectiveness of Treatment A, $E_A = 1.8$ quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).\n- Cost of Treatment B, $C_B = \\$1,000$.\n- Effectiveness of Treatment B, $E_B = 1.2$ QALYs.\n- The willingness-to-pay threshold, $\\lambda = \\$1,000$ per QALY.\n\nThe problem asks for an evaluation of \"Treatment A versus Treatment B\".

The analysis seeks to determine if the additional health gain from Treatment A justifies its additional cost.\n\nThe ICER is defined as the ratio of the incremental cost to the incremental effectiveness.\n\nThe incremental cost, denoted as $\\Delta C$, is the difference between the cost of the alternative (Treatment A) and the cost of the comparator (Treatment B).\n$$\n\\Delta C = C_A - C_B\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Delta C = \\$1,500 - \\$1,000 = \\$500\n$$\n\nThe incremental effect, denoted as $\\Delta E$, is the difference between the effectiveness of the alternative (Treatment A) and the effectiveness of the comparator (Treatment B).\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_A - E_B\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Delta E = 1.8 \\text{ QALYs} - 1.2 \\text{ QALYs} = 0.6 \\text{ QALYs}\n$$\n\nNow, we can compute the ICER using its definition:\n$$\nICER = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated incremental values:\n$$\nICER = \\frac{\\$500}{0.6 \\text{ QALYs}} = \\frac{500}{0.6} \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{QALY}} = \\frac{5000}{6} \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{QALY}} = \\frac{2500}{3} \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{QALY}}\n$$\nAs a decimal, the exact value is $833.333...$ USD/QALY.

The fifth digit is $3$, which is less than $5$, so we do not round up the fourth digit.\n$$\nICER \\approx 833.3 \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{QALY}}\n$$\n\nThe final step is to apply the decision rule.
