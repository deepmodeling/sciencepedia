Under TRIPS, the minimum patent term is $20$ years from the filing date. The FTA obligation states that, for pharmaceuticals, if the regulatory authority’s marketing approval review exceeds a statutory benchmark of $1$ year (with no applicant-caused delay), the patent term shall be restored by the portion of the review beyond the $1$-year benchmark, up to a maximum of $3$ years.

Express your final answer as a number of days. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is determined to be valid as it presents a well-defined mathematical calculation based on a clear and consistent set of axiomatic rules. The problem is self-contained, objective, and well-posed, admitting a unique numerical solution. The process to solve it involves date and duration calculations.\n\nThe solution is derived in four main steps:\n1.  Determine the base patent term expiration date.\n2.  Calculate the duration of the patent term restoration.\n3.  Determine the final, restored patent expiration date.\n4.  Compute the total number of days from the filing date to the restored expiration date.\n\nFirst, we establish the base patent term. The patent was filed on the date $D_{\\text{file}} = 2007\\text{-}06\\text{-}15$. According to TRIPS, the minimum patent term is $T_{\\text{base}} = 20$ years from the filing date. Therefore, the base patent expiration date, $D_{\\text{expire,base}}$, is calculated as:\n$$D_{\\text{expire,base}} = 2007\\text{-}06\\text{-}15 + 20 \\text{ years} = 2027\\text{-}06\\text{-}15$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the patent term restoration. The regulatory review period for marketing authorization began on the submission date, $D_{\\text{submit}} = 2018\\text{-}01\\text{-}01$, and concluded on the approval date, $D_{\\text{approve}} = 2021\\text{-}01\\text{-}01$. The duration of this review, $T_{\\text{review}}$, is the interval between these two dates:\n$$T_{\\text{review}} = D_{\\text{approve}} - D_{\\text{submit}} = (2021\\text{-}01\\text{-}01) - (2018\\text{-}01\\text{-}01) = 3 \\text{ years}$$\nThe statutory benchmark for the review process is given as $T_{\\text{benchmark}} = 1$ year. The restoration is granted for the portion of the review period that exceeds this benchmark. This eligible restoration period, $T_{\\text{eligible}}$, is:\n$$T_{\\text{eligible}} = T_{\\text{review}} - T_{\\text{benchmark}} = 3 \\text{ years} - 1 \\text{ year} = 2 \\text{ years}$$\nThe FTA specifies a maximum restoration period of $T_{\\text{max\\_restore}} = 3$ years. The actual restoration granted, $T_{\\text{restore}}$, is the minimum of the eligible period and the maximum allowed period:\n$$T_{\\text{restore}} = \\min(T_{\\text{eligible}}, T_{\\text{max\\_restore}}) = \\min(2 \\text{ years}, 3 \\text{ years}) = 2 \\text{ years}$$\n\nThird, we determine the restored patent expiration date, $D_{\\text{expire,restored}}$. This is found by adding the restoration period to the base expiration date:\n$$D_{\\text{expire,restored}} = D_{\\text{expire,base}} + T_{\\text{restore}} = 2027\\text{-}06\\text{-}15 + 2 \\text{ years} = 2029\\text{-}06\\text{-}15$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of days from the filing date, $D_{\\text{file}} = 2007\\text{-}06\\text{-}15$, to the restored expiration date, $D_{\\text{expire,restored}} = 2029\\text{-}06\\text{-}15$. The total duration in years is $2029 - 2007 = 22$ years. To convert this duration into days, we must account for leap years, which have $366$ days instead of the standard $365$.\n\nAccording to the Gregorian calendar rule provided, a leap year occurs if the year is divisible by $4$, unless it is divisible by $100$ but not by $400$. We must count the number of leap days (February $29$) that fall within the period from $2007\\text{-}06\\text{-}15$ to $2029\\text{-}06\\text{-}15$. The leap years in this interval are:\n$2008$, $2012$, $2016$, $2020$, $2024$, and $2028$.\nNone of these years are divisible by $100$. Thus, there are $N_{\\text{leap}} = 6$ leap years during the patent term. The total duration spans $N_{\\text{total}} = 22$ years. The number of non-leap years is $N_{\\text{non-leap}} = N_{\\text{total}} - N_{\\text{leap}} = 22 - 6 = 16$.\n\nThe total number of days, $D_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the days in all the non-leap and leap years:\n$$D_{\\text{total}} = (N_{\\text{non-leap}} \\times 365) + (N_{\\text{leap}} \\times 366)$$\n$$D_{\\text{total}} = (16 \\times 365) + (6 \\times 366)$$\n$$D_{\\text{total}} = 5840 + 2196 = 8036$$\nAn equivalent calculation is to take the number of days in $22$ standard years and add the number of extra days from the $6$ leap years:\n$$D_{\\text{total}} = (22 \\times 365) + 6 = 8030 + 6 = 8036$$\nThe total duration of the patent from the filing date to the restored end date is $8036$ days.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8036}$$", "id": "4979739"}, {"introduction": "The high price of patented medicines is a major barrier to access, and delays in the entry of generic competition can cost health systems and patients millions of dollars.

This exercise provides a simplified but powerful model to quantify the direct financial harm to consumers from such a delay, helping you translate a legal maneuver into a tangible economic impact.

The harm is defined as the cumulative excess expenditure due to a delay in generic competition.\n\nFirst, we identify and define the provided variables:\n- The delay period is $T = 24$ months.\n- The price of the brand-name medicine is $P_B = \\$100$ per course.\n- The expected price of the generic medicine is $P_G = \\$20$ per course.\n- The observed total monthly spending on the brand-name medicine is $E_B = \\$10,000,000$.\n\nA central assumption is that the monthly quantity of the medicine demanded, denoted as $Q$, remains constant. This is justified by the statement that demand for this essential medicine is highly inelastic. We can calculate this quantity $Q$ using the relationship between total expenditure, price, and quantity.\n\nThe total monthly expenditure $E_B$ is the product of the price per course $P_B$ and the quantity of courses sold $Q$:\n$$E_B = P_B \\times Q$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the quantity $Q$:\n$$Q = \\frac{E_B}{P_B}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$Q = \\frac{10,000,000}{100} = 100,000 \\text{ courses per month}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the monthly consumer harm, which is defined as the excess expenditure in a single month. This is the difference between the actual expenditure under the brand price ($E_B$) and the counterfactual expenditure that would have occurred at the generic price ($E_G$).\n\nThe counterfactual monthly expenditure, $E_G$, is the product of the generic price $P_G$ and the constant monthly quantity $Q$:\n$$E_G = P_G \\times Q$$\nSubstituting the values for $P_G$ and $Q$:\n$$E_G = 20 \\times 100,000 = \\$2,000,000$$\n\nThe monthly excess expenditure, which we denote as $H_{\\text{monthly}}$, is the difference between $E_B$ and $E_G$:\n$$H_{\\text{monthly}} = E_B - E_G$$\n$$H_{\\text{monthly}} = \\$10,000,000 - \\$2,000,000 = \\$8,000,000$$\n\nAlternatively, the monthly excess expenditure can be calculated as the per-unit price difference multiplied by the quantity.
