Consider a dichotomous exposure, where individuals are classified as either exposed to high-speed travel (above the new limit) or unexposed (at or below the new limit). Let $p$ denote the prevalence of exposure to high-speed travel, $I_{1}$ denote the incidence of severe road traffic injury among the exposed, $I_{0}$ denote the incidence among the unexposed, and $RR$ denote the relative risk defined by $RR = I_{1}/I_{0}$. The population incidence is $I_{\\text{pop}} = p I_{1} + (1-p) I_{0}$, and the population attributable fraction is defined as the fraction of the population incidence that would be avoided if exposure were eliminated: $PAF = \\dfrac{I_{\\text{pop}} - I_{0}}{I_{\\text{pop}}}$.\n\nA city called Metrovia reduces the prevalence of high-speed exposure from $p_{0} = 0.40$ to $p_{1} = 0.25$ under the speed limit policy.

We can substitute this into the expression for $PAF$ to eliminate $I_{1}$ and $I_{0}$.\n$$PAF = \\frac{p(RR \\cdot I_{0} - I_{0})}{p(RR \\cdot I_{0}) + (1-p)I_{0}}$$\nAssuming the incidence in the unexposed is non-zero ($I_{0} \\neq 0$), which is necessary for the problem to be meaningful, we can factor $I_{0}$ out of both the numerator and the denominator:\n$$PAF = \\frac{p \\cdot I_{0}(RR - 1)}{I_{0}[p \\cdot RR + (1-p)]}$$\nCanceling the common term $I_{0}$:\n$$PAF = \\frac{p(RR - 1)}{p \\cdot RR + 1 - p}$$\nThis can be rearranged slightly for clarity:\n$$PAF = \\frac{p(RR - 1)}{p(RR - 1) + 1}$$\nThis is the required expression for $PAF$ in terms of the prevalence of exposure $p$ and the relative risk $RR$.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of $\\Delta PAF$ for Metrovia**\n\nWe are given the initial prevalence $p_{0} = 0.40$, the final prevalence after the policy intervention $p_{1} = 0.25$, and the relative risk $RR = 2.5$. We use the derived formula to compute the $PAF$ before and after the intervention.\n\nThe initial Population Attributable Fraction, $PAF(p_{0})$, is:\n$$PAF(p_{0}) = \\frac{p_{0}(RR - 1)}{p_{0}(RR - 1) + 1} = \\frac{0.40(2.5 - 1)}{0.40(2.5 - 1) + 1}$$\n$$PAF(p_{0}) = \\frac{0.40(1.5)}{0.40(1.5) + 1} = \\frac{0.6}{0.6 + 1} = \\frac{0.6}{1.6} = \\frac{3}{8} = 0.375$$\nSo, initially, $37.5\\%$ of severe injuries were attributable to high-speed travel.\n\nThe final Population Attributable Fraction, $PAF(p_{1})$, is:\n$$PAF(p_{1}) = \\frac{p_{1}(RR - 1)}{p_{1}(RR - 1) + 1} = \\frac{0.25(2.5 - 1)}{0.25(2.5 - 1) + 1}$$\n$$PAF(p_{1}) = \\frac{0.25(1.5)}{0.25(1.5) + 1} = \\frac{0.375}{0.375 + 1} = \\frac{0.375}{1.375} = \\frac{3}{11}$$\nAs a decimal, $PAF(p_{1}) \\approx 0.2727...$ So, after the intervention, approximately $27.3\\%$ of severe injuries are attributable to high-speed travel.\n\nThe change in the Population Attributable Fraction, $\\Delta PAF$, is the difference between the final and initial values:\n$$\\Delta PAF = PAF(p_{1}) - PAF(p_{0}) = \\frac{3}{11} - \\frac{3}{8}$$\n$$\\Delta PAF = \\frac{24 - 33}{88} = -\\frac{9}{88} \\approx -0.1022727...$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives:\n$$\\Delta PAF \\approx -0.1023$$\n\n**Part 3: Interpretation**\n\nThe sign of $\\Delta PAF$ is negative, indicating a reduction in the population attributable fraction.

From an equity perspective, PAF quantifies the burden of disease that is, in theory, preventable and unevenly distributed (i.e., it falls upon the exposed group). By reducing the PAF, the policy has not only lowered the overall injury burden but has also made the distribution of risk more equitable across the population, as a smaller fraction of the total health outcome is now explained by this specific, modifiable exposure.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-0.1023}\n$$", "id": "5002824"}, {"introduction": "A cornerstone of implementing HiAP is the Health Impact Assessment (HIA), a systematic process for predicting the health consequences of policies in non-health sectors.

The terms are well-defined, and the setup is internally consistent and complete for the tasks required. It is a well-posed problem. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nPart 1: Derivation and Calculation of Avoided Deaths\n\nThe number of deaths is the product of the population size and the mortality rate. The baseline number of deaths per year is $D_0 = N y_0$. After the policy reduces the $\\text{PM}_{2.5}$ concentration, the new mortality rate is $y_1$, and the new number of deaths is $D_1 = N y_1$. The number of deaths avoided per year, $\\Delta D$, is the difference:\n$$\n\\Delta D = D_0 - D_1 = N (y_0 - y_1)\n$$\nThe relationship between the mortality rates $y_0$ and $y_1$ is given by the relative risk. The relative risk of the baseline concentration compared to the new, lower concentration is the ratio of the mortality rates, $y_0 / y_1$. The change in concentration from the new state to the baseline state is an increase of $\\Delta C$. Using the provided log-linear model, this relative risk is:\n$$\n\\frac{y_0}{y_1} = \\mathrm{RR}(\\Delta C) = \\exp(\\theta \\Delta C)\n$$\nFrom this, we can express the new mortality rate $y_1$ in terms of the baseline rate $y_0$:\n$$\ny_1 = y_0 \\exp(-\\theta \\Delta C)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for avoided deaths gives the exact formula under the log-linear model:\n$$\n\\Delta D = N(y_0 - y_0 \\exp(-\\theta \\Delta C)) = N y_0 (1 - \\exp(-\\theta \\Delta C))\n$$\nThe problem asks for a linearized expression, which is obtained by a first-order Taylor series approximation of the exponential term. For a small argument $x$, $\\exp(x) \\approx 1 + x$. Here, the argument is $x = -\\theta \\Delta C$. The approximation is valid if $|\\theta \\Delta C| \\ll 1$. We can verify this condition. The parameter $\\theta$ is:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{\\ln(\\mathrm{RR}_{10})}{10} = \\frac{\\ln(1.06)}{10} \\approx \\frac{0.05827}{10} = 0.005827 \\, (\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{m}^{3})^{-1}\n$$\nThe argument is $-\\theta \\Delta C \\approx -0.005827 \\times 3.2 \\approx -0.0186$. Since $|-0.0186| \\ll 1$, the linear approximation is well-justified.\nApplying the approximation $\\exp(-\\theta \\Delta C) \\approx 1 - \\theta \\Delta C$ to the formula for $\\Delta D$:\n$$\n\\Delta D \\approx N y_0 (1 - (1 - \\theta \\Delta C)) = N y_0 (1 - 1 + \\theta \\Delta C)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the derived linearized exposure–response expression:\n$$\n\\Delta D \\approx N y_0 \\theta \\Delta C\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value for the expected annual avoided deaths using the provided inputs:\n- $N = 1.2 \\times 10^{6}$\n- $y_0 = 7.5 \\times 10^{-3}$\n- $\\Delta C = 3.2$\n- $\\theta = \\frac{\\ln(1.06)}{10}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the linearized expression:\n$$\n\\Delta D = (1.2 \\times 10^{6}) \\times (7.5 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\ln(1.06)}{10}\\right) \\times 3.2\n$$\nThe baseline number of annual deaths is $D_0 = N y_0 = (1.2 \\times 10^{6}) \\times (7.5 \\times 10^{-3}) = 9000$.\n$$\n\\Delta D = 9000 \\times \\left(\\frac{\\ln(1.06)}{10}\\right) \\times 3.2 = 900 \\times \\ln(1.06) \\times 3.2\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta D = 2880 \\times \\ln(1.06) \\approx 2880 \\times 0.0582689 \\approx 167.81445...\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $168$ avoided deaths per year.\n\nPart 2: Uncertainty Propagation\n\nTo propagate uncertainty, we consider the estimate of avoided deaths, $\\Delta D$, as a function of the uncertain parameters, which are the concentration-response slope $\\theta$ and the $\\text{PM}_{2.5}$ reduction $\\Delta C$. The population $N$ and baseline mortality rate $y_0$ are treated as known constants. The linearized model is $\\Delta D(\\theta, \\Delta C) = N y_0 \\theta \\Delta C$.\n\nLet $\\mu_\\theta$ and $\\sigma_\\theta^2$ be the mean and variance of the estimate for $\\theta$, and let $\\mu_{\\Delta C}$ and $\\sigma_{\\Delta C}^2$ be the mean and variance of the estimate for $\\Delta C$. The central estimate for avoided deaths is $\\Delta \\hat{D} = N y_0 \\mu_\\theta \\mu_{\\Delta C}$.\n\nUsing a first-order Taylor series expansion (the delta method) to approximate the variance of $\\Delta D$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta D) \\approx \\left( \\frac{\\partial(\\Delta D)}{\\partial \\theta} \\right)^2 \\sigma_\\theta^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\partial(\\Delta D)}{\\partial \\Delta C} \\right)^2 \\sigma_{\\Delta C}^2 + 2 \\left( \\frac{\\partial(\\Delta D)}{\\partial \\theta} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\partial(\\Delta D)}{\\partial \\Delta C} \\right) \\mathrm{Cov}(\\theta, \\Delta C)\n$$\nThe partial derivatives, evaluated at the mean values, are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial(\\Delta D)}{\\partial \\theta} = N y_0 \\Delta C \\implies (N y_0 \\mu_{\\Delta C})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial(\\Delta D)}{\\partial \\Delta C} = N y_0 \\theta \\implies (N y_0 \\mu_{\\theta})\n$$\nUnder the given independence assumption, the covariance term $\\mathrm{Cov}(\\theta, \\Delta C)$ is $0$. Substituting the partial derivatives into the variance formula yields:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta D) \\approx (N y_0 \\mu_{\\Delta C})^2 \\sigma_\\theta^2 + (N y_0 \\mu_\\theta)^2 \\sigma_{\\Delta C}^2\n$$\nThis expression identifies the two primary components of variance in the final estimate.\n1.  The first term, $(N y_0 \\mu_{\\Delta C})^2 \\sigma_\\theta^2$, represents the contribution from the uncertainty in the scientific evidence base, specifically the concentration-response slope $\\sigma_\\theta^2$. This is often termed \"parameter uncertainty\".\n2.  The second term, $(N y_0 \\mu_\\theta)^2 \\sigma_{\\Delta C}^2$, represents the contribution from the uncertainty in the projected effectiveness of the policy, $\\sigma_{\\Delta C}^2$. This is often termed \"exposure uncertainty\".\n\nIn the context of HiAP decision-making, this decomposition is highly valuable. It distinguishes between uncertainty inherent in the current state of scientific knowledge (from $\\sigma_\\theta^2$) and uncertainty related to the specific policy's implementation and impact (from $\\sigma_{\\Delta C}^2$). If the overall uncertainty, often represented by a $95\\%$ confidence interval around $\\Delta \\hat{D}$, is large, decision-makers can use this decomposition to understand the primary driver. If exposure uncertainty is dominant, they might invest in better modeling or monitoring of the policy's impact. If parameter uncertainty is dominant, they must accept the limitations of the current science while making a decision, perhaps opting for more precautionary measures.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{168}\n$$", "id": "5002778"}, {"introduction": "A core goal of the HiAP approach is to promote health equity, but how can we formally incorporate this goal into policy decisions?

Since $W_{B}^{(S1)} > W_{A}^{(S1)}$, Policy B is the preferred intervention. The positive value of $\\Delta = 1.45$ confirms that Policy B generates greater equity-weighted social welfare.\n\n**Effect of Shifting from $S1$ to $S2$ (Utilitarian)**:\nThe defining characteristic of the utilitarian scheme $S2$ is that $w_i=1$ for all groups, meaning it aggregates net benefits without regard for their distribution. Under $S2$, $W_{A}^{(S2)} = W_{B}^{(S2)} = 24$, indicating that the two policies are of equal value. The preference for Policy B that existed under $S1$ disappears. This change occurs because the raw sum of net benefits for both policies is identical. Policy A provides a large benefit ($12$) to the least deprived group and smaller benefits ($7$ and $5$) to more deprived groups. Policy B provides a smaller benefit ($7$) to the least deprived but larger benefits ($9$ and $8$) to the more deprived groups. The $S1$ scheme amplifies the value of benefits to more deprived groups, favoring Policy B. The $S2$ scheme removes this amplification, treating a dollar of net benefit to any group as equal, which results in indifference between the two policies.\n\n**Effect of Shifting from $S1$ to $S3$ (Strong Equity)**:\nThe shift from $S1$ to $S3$ involves increasing the equity parameter $\\alpha$ from $0.5$ to $1.0$. This makes the weight $w_i = 1+\\alpha d_i$ more sensitive to the deprivation index $d_i$. Consequently, the weights for the more deprived groups (group $2$ and especially group $3$) increase more substantially than the weight for the least deprived group. Under $S3$, the preference for Policy B not only persists but is strengthened: the welfare difference $W_{B}^{(S3)} - W_{A}^{(S3)} = 38.0 - 35.1 = 2.9$, which is greater than the difference of $1.45$ under $S1$. This increased margin of preference for Policy B occurs because its net benefit distribution is progressive, delivering greater value to the moderately and most deprived groups ($NB_2^B > NB_2^A$ and $NB_3^B > NB_3^A$). The stronger equity focus of $S3$ assigns even greater importance to these benefits, thereby magnifying Policy B's advantage over the more regressive Policy A.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.450}\n$$", "id": "5002833"}]}
