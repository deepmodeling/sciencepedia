Under the assumption of homogeneous mixing, any given contact is with an infectious person with probability $\\frac{I(t)}{N}$.\n3.  **Rate of contact with infectious individuals:** For a single susceptible person, the rate of making contact with infectious individuals is the total contact rate multiplied by the probability that a contact is infectious.\n    $$\n    \\text{Rate of infectious contacts} = c \\times \\frac{I(t)}{N}\n    $$\n4.  **Probability of transmission:** Each contact with an infectious individual leads to transmission with a probability $p$.\n\nThe force of infection, $\\lambda(t)$, is an instantaneous rate. In this context, it is the product of the rate of infectious contacts and the probability of transmission per contact.

The threshold condition determines whether an epidemic will grow or die out upon introduction of an infectious agent into a susceptible population.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing differential equations for the number of infectious individuals, $I(t)$. The state variables are $S(t)$, $I(t)$, and $R(t)$, representing the number of individuals in the susceptible, infectious, and removed compartments, respectively. The total population size $N$ is constant, such that $N = S(t) + I(t) + R(t)$. The rate at which infectious individuals are removed (e.g., through recovery and gaining immunity) is given by $\\gamma I(t)$, where $\\gamma  0$ is the removal rate and $1/\\gamma$ is the average infectious period.\n\nThe initial condition for an emerging epidemic is characterized by a very small number of infectious individuals, $I(0)  0$, and a population that is almost entirely susceptible, so that $S(0) \\approx N$. The condition for an epidemic to take hold is that the number of infectious individuals must initially increase, i.e., $\\frac{dI}{dt}|_{t=0}  0$.\n\nCase 1: Density-Dependent (Mass-Action) Incidence\nUnder this assumption, the rate of new infections is proportional to the product of the densities of susceptible and infectious individuals. In a model with population numbers rather than densities, this is formalized as being proportional to the product of the numbers of individuals, $S$ and $I$. The rate of new infections is $\\beta S I$, where $\\beta  0$ is the transmission parameter. The differential equation for the infectious compartment is:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dt} = \\text{rate of infection} - \\text{rate of removal} = \\beta S(t) I(t) - \\gamma I(t) $$\nWe can factor out $I(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dt} = I(t) (\\beta S(t) - \\gamma) $$\nTo assess the initial growth, we evaluate this derivative at $t=0$:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dt}|_{t=0} = I(0) (\\beta S(0) - \\gamma) $$\nFor the epidemic to grow, we require $\\frac{dI}{dt}|_{t=0}  0$. Since $I(0)  0$ by definition (an infection has been introduced), the condition for growth is:\n$$ \\beta S(0) - \\gamma  0 $$\nUsing the approximation for a nearly entirely susceptible population, $S(0) \\approx N$, the condition becomes:\n$$ \\beta N - \\gamma  0 $$\nRearranging this inequality gives the threshold condition:\n$$ \\frac{\\beta N}{\\gamma}  1 $$\nThe epidemic threshold is therefore the dimensionless expression $\\frac{\\beta N}{\\gamma}$.

This implies that, all else being equal, a larger population is inherently more vulnerable to an epidemic outbreak. This model assumes an individual's number of contacts scales with the population density.\nThe frequency-dependent threshold, $R_{0, \\text{freq}} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}$, is independent of $N$. This model assumes that individuals have a relatively fixed number of contacts regardless of the total population size. The spread of the disease depends on the probability that a given contact is with an infectious person ($I/N$), not the absolute number of infectious people. This is often considered a more realistic model for diseases spread by close contact in human populations, where social structures constrain contact rates.\n\nThe two requested expressions are $\\frac{\\beta N}{\\gamma}$ for density-dependent incidence and $\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}$ for frequency-dependent incidence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\beta N}{\\gamma}  \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4544623"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of disease modeling is often to inform control strategies.
