This practice bridges theory and real-world engineering constraints to build a secure and functional system.", "problem": "A Ministry of Health is deploying a nationwide Health Information System (HIS) that issues pseudonymous patient identifiers to avoid embedding any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in the identifier itself. Each identifier will be generated independently by sampling uniformly at random from all binary strings of length $k$ (that is, a $k$-bit identifier), and will be stored and printed in a human- and machine-readable Base32 alphabet, where each character encodes $5$ bits, so that the printed length is $L = \\lceil k/5 \\rceil$ characters.\n\nOperational planners estimate that at most $M = 4.5 \\times 10^{7}$ unique individuals will be issued identifiers over the next decade.

The analysis begins with the principles of probability related to the \"birthday problem.\"\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of possible unique identifiers. Since the identifiers are binary strings of length $k$, the size of the identifier space is $N = 2^k$. The problem states that $M$ identifiers are generated independently and uniformly at random from this space. This is equivalent to sampling with replacement from a set of $N$ items.\n\nThe probability of at least one collision, $P(\\text{collision})$, is $1$ minus the probability of no collisions, $P(\\text{no collision})$. The probability of no collisions is the probability that all $M$ chosen identifiers are distinct.\nThe first identifier can be chosen in $N$ ways.\nThe second, to be different, can be chosen in $N-1$ ways.\nThe $M$-th identifier, to be different from the previous $M-1$, can be chosen in $N-(M-1)$ ways.\nThe total number of ways to choose $M$ distinct identifiers in order is the permutation $P(N, M) = N(N-1)\\cdots(N-M+1) = \\frac{N!}{(N-M)!}$.\nThe total number of ways to choose any $M$ identifiers with replacement is $N^M$.\nTherefore, the probability of no collisions is:\n$$P(\\text{no collision}) = \\frac{N(N-1)\\cdots(N-M+1)}{N^M} = \\prod_{i=0}^{M-1} \\frac{N-i}{N} = \\prod_{i=0}^{M-1} \\left(1 - \\frac{i}{N}\\right)$$\nThe problem requires that the collision probability does not exceed a tolerance $\\varepsilon$:\n$$P(\\text{collision}) = 1 - P(\\text{no collision}) \\leq \\varepsilon$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(\\text{no collision})$:\n$$1 - \\prod_{i=0}^{M-1} \\left(1 - \\frac{i}{N}\\right) \\leq \\varepsilon$$\nThis exact form is difficult to solve for $k$. We apply the standard approximation from birthday-bound reasoning. For small $x$, the exponential function can be approximated as $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1-x$. Applying this to each term in the product:\n$$P(\\text{no collision}) \\approx \\prod_{i=0}^{M-1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{i}{N}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\sum_{i=0}^{M-1} \\frac{i}{N}\\right)$$\nThe sum is an arithmetic series: $\\sum_{i=0}^{M-1} i = \\frac{(M-1)M}{2}$.\nThus, the approximation for the no-collision probability becomes:\n$$P(\\text{no collision}) \\approx \\exp\\left(-\\frac{M(M-1)}{2N}\\right)$$\nThe collision probability inequality is then:\n$$1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{M(M-1)}{2N}\\right) \\leq \\varepsilon$$\nThis is the required inequality relating $k$ (via $N=2^k$), $M$, and $\\varepsilon$.\n\nNext, we derive a closed-form lower bound on $k$.

The identifier is printed in Base32, where each character encodes $5$ bits. The printed length $L$ for a $k$-bit identifier is $L = \\lceil k/5 \\rceil$. The problem states that the printed identifier must not exceed $16$ characters, so $L \\leq 16$.\n$$ \\lceil k/5 \\rceil \\leq 16 $$\nFor the minimum $k$ derived from the collision risk, $k=70$, the printed length is:\n$$ L = \\lceil 70/5 \\rceil = \\lceil 14 \\rceil = 14 $$\nSince $14 \\leq 16$, the length constraint is satisfied for $k=70$.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimal integer $k$ that satisfies both conditions.

Consider two districts, Alpha and Beta. Each district’s monthly data are composed of two subgroups of service delivery sites: Subgroup $S_1$ (higher-risk catchment; historically lower completion) and Subgroup $S_2$ (lower-risk catchment; historically higher completion). For one recent month, the counts are:\n- District Alpha: $S_1$ has $n_{A,1} = 900$ eligible children with $s_{A,1} = 540$ completions; $S_2$ has $n_{A,2} = 100$ eligible children with $s_{A,2} = 95$ completions.\n- District Beta: $S_1$ has $n_{B,1} = 100$ eligible children with $s_{B,1} = 55$ completions; $S_2$ has $n_{B,2} = 900$ eligible children with $s_{B,2} = 810$ completions.\n\nUsing fundamental definitions from probability and epidemiology:\n- A rate is a proportion $p = s/n$ over a defined cohort and period.\n- Conditional probabilities satisfy the law of total probability: for a district $D$, the overall success probability is $P(\\text{complete} \\mid D) = \\sum_{g \\in \\{S_1,S_2\\}} P(\\text{complete} \\mid D, g)\\,P(g \\mid D)$.\n\nAssume visual aggregation on the dashboard reduces each district to a single bar showing $P(\\text{complete} \\mid D)$ for the month without showing subgroup structure. Which option correctly demonstrates whether Simpson’s paradox occurs with these data, explains how visual aggregation can hide variance, and proposes safeguards in dashboard design that are appropriate for routine monitoring of health indicators?\n\nA. District Alpha’s subgroup rates are $p_{A,1} = s_{A,1}/n_{A,1} = 540/900 = 0.60$ and $p_{A,2} = s_{A,2}/n_{A,2} = 95/100 = 0.95$; District Beta’s subgroup rates are $p_{B,1} = 55/100 = 0.55$ and $p_{B,2} = 810/900 = 0.90$. The aggregated rates are $p_A = (540+95)/(900+100) = 635/1000 = 0.635$ and $p_B = (55+810)/(100+900) = 865/1000 = 0.865$. Simpson’s paradox occurs because District Alpha outperforms District Beta in both subgroups ($0.60  0.55$ and $0.95  0.90$), yet the aggregated dashboard bars show District Beta higher overall ($0.865  0.635$) due to different subgroup weights $P(S_g \\mid D)$. A single aggregated bar hides variance by masking subgroup-specific performance and composition. Safeguards: show stratified small-multiple views by subgroup alongside the overall bar; display denominators and subgroup composition (the weights $n_{D,g}$ and proportions $n_{D,g}/\\sum_g n_{D,g}$); and enable drill-down with alerts when subgroup composition shifts across time.\n\nB. Compute unweighted means of subgroup percentages: District Alpha’s average is $(0.60 + 0.95)/2 = 0.775$ and District Beta’s average is $(0.55 + 0.90)/2 = 0.725$, so Simpson’s paradox does not occur because District Alpha is still higher overall. Visual aggregation reduces noise, so the dashboard should aggregate more months and hide subgroup details to avoid confusion.\n\nC. Aggregated rates are $p_A = 0.635$ and $p_B = 0.865$, so the dashboard correctly shows District Beta as superior; there is no paradox since the overall bars are definitive. To guard against misinterpretation, collapse the subgroups into one and apply moving-average smoothing with a logarithmic axis for all districts.\n\nD. District Alpha’s subgroup rates are $0.60$ and $0.95$, and District Beta’s subgroup rates are $0.50$ and $0.90$ (since $55/100 \\approx 0.50$).

The scenario is a classic and realistic illustration of Simpson's paradox. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation and Analysis**\n\nFirst, we will calculate the immunization coverage rates for each subgroup in each district. The rate, or proportion, is given by $p = s/n$.\n\nFor District Alpha:\n- Subgroup $S_1$ rate: $p_{A,1} = \\frac{s_{A,1}}{n_{A,1}} = \\frac{540}{900} = 0.60$.\n- Subgroup $S_2$ rate: $p_{A,2} = \\frac{s_{A,2}}{n_{A,2}} = \\frac{95}{100} = 0.95$.\n\nFor District Beta:\n- Subgroup $S_1$ rate: $p_{B,1} = \\frac{s_{B,1}}{n_{B,1}} = \\frac{55}{100} = 0.55$.\n- Subgroup $S_2$ rate: $p_{B,2} = \\frac{s_{B,2}}{n_{B,2}} = \\frac{810}{900} = 0.90$.\n\nNext, we compare the performance of the districts within each subgroup:\n- For subgroup $S_1$: $p_{A,1} = 0.60$ and $p_{B,1} = 0.55$. Thus, $p_{A,1}  p_{B,1}$. District Alpha has a higher completion rate in this subgroup.\n- For subgroup $S_2$: $p_{A,2} = 0.95$ and $p_{B,2} = 0.90$. Thus, $p_{A,2}  p_{B,2}$. District Alpha also has a higher completion rate in this subgroup.\n\nBased on the stratified data, District Alpha's immunization program is more effective than District Beta's in both identified subgroups.\n\nNow, we calculate the aggregated (overall) rates for each district, which is what the dashboard displays. The aggregated rate is the total number of completions divided by the total number of eligible children.\n\nFor District Alpha:\n- Aggregated rate: $p_A = \\frac{s_{A,1} + s_{A,2}}{n_{A,1} + n_{A,2}} = \\frac{540 + 95}{900 + 100} = \\frac{635}{1000} = 0.635$.\n\nFor District Beta:\n- Aggregated rate: $p_B = \\frac{s_{B,1} + s_{B,2}}{n_{B,1} + n_{B,2}} = \\frac{55 + 810}{100 + 900} = \\frac{865}{1000} = 0.865$.\n\nComparing the aggregated rates:\n- $p_A = 0.635$ and $p_B = 0.865$. Thus, $p_A  p_B$. The aggregated data show that District Beta has a substantially higher overall completion rate than District Alpha.\n\n**Conclusion on Simpson's Paradox:**\nSimpson's paradox occurs when a trend appears in several different groups of data but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined. Here, the trend within groups is that Alpha is superior to Beta ($p_{A,1}  p_{B,1}$ and $p_{A,2}  p_{B,2}$). The trend in the combined group is that Beta is superior to Alpha ($p_B  p_A$). The trend has reversed. Therefore, Simpson's paradox is present in these data.\n\nThe reversal is explained by the law of total probability, where the overall rate is a weighted average of subgroup rates. The weights are the proportion of the total population in each subgroup, $P(g \\mid D) = n_{D,g} / \\sum_g n_{D,g}$.\n- For Alpha, the weights are $P(S_1 \\mid A) = \\frac{900}{1000} = 0.9$ and $P(S_2 \\mid A) = \\frac{100}{1000} = 0.1$. Its overall rate is heavily influenced by the lower-performing subgroup $S_1$: $p_A = (0.60)(0.9) + (0.95)(0.1) = 0.54 + 0.095 = 0.635$.\n- For Beta, the weights are $P(S_1 \\mid B) = \\frac{100}{1000} = 0.1$ and $P(S_2 \\mid B) = \\frac{900}{1000} = 0.9$. Its overall rate is heavily influenced by the higher-performing subgroup $S_2$: $p_B = (0.55)(0.1) + (0.90)(0.9) = 0.055 + 0.81 = 0.865$.\n\nThe visual aggregation on the dashboard, showing only $p_A$ and $p_B$, is therefore highly misleading. It hides the fact that District Alpha's programs are more effective under comparable conditions and that District Beta's high aggregate score is due to a favorable population distribution (a large majority of its children are in the easier-to-reach, lower-risk subgroup $S_2$).\n\nProper safeguards in dashboard design must aim to reveal, not hide, such confounding structures. This includes stratification, transparency of denominators, and interactive exploration.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. District Alpha’s subgroup rates are $p_{A,1} = s_{A,1}/n_{A,1} = 540/900 = 0.60$ and $p_{A,2} = s_{A,2}/n_{A,2} = 95/100 = 0.95$; District Beta’s subgroup rates are $p_{B,1} = 55/100 = 0.55$ and $p_{B,2} = 810/900 = 0.90$. The aggregated rates are $p_A = (540+95)/(900+100) = 635/1000 = 0.635$ and $p_B = (55+810)/(100+900) = 865/1000 = 0.865$. Simpson’s paradox occurs because District Alpha outperforms District Beta in both subgroups ($0.60  0.55$ and $0.95  0.90$), yet the aggregated dashboard bars show District Beta higher overall ($0.865  0.635$) due to different subgroup weights $P(S_g \\mid D)$. A single aggregated bar hides variance by masking subgroup-specific performance and composition. Safeguards: show stratified small-multiple views by subgroup alongside the overall bar; display denominators and subgroup composition (the weights $n_{D,g}$ and proportions $n_{D,g}/\\sum_g n_{D,g}$); and enable drill-down with alerts when subgroup composition shifts across time.**\n- **Analysis:** This option presents all calculations correctly. It correctly identifies the presence of Simpson's paradox and accurately explains the reversal based on the stratified rates versus the aggregated rates. The explanation correctly attributes the cause to the confounding effect of differing subgroup weights. The explanation of how aggregation hides variance is accurate. The proposed safeguards (stratification via small multiples, showing denominators/weights, and enabling drill-down) are standard, effective, and appropriate best practices in data visualization and dashboard design for addressing this very problem.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. Compute unweighted means of subgroup percentages: District Alpha’s average is $(0.60 + 0.95)/2 = 0.775$ and District Beta’s average is $(0.55 + 0.90)/2 = 0.725$, so Simpson’s paradox does not occur because District Alpha is still higher overall. Visual aggregation reduces noise, so the dashboard should aggregate more months and hide subgroup details to avoid confusion.**\n- **Analysis:** This option performs an irrelevant calculation. The unweighted mean of subgroup rates is a statistically meaningless quantity in this context because it ignores the vastly different sizes of the subgroups. The dashboard displays the weighted average (the true proportion), which is $0.635$ for Alpha and $0.865$ for Beta. The paradox is the reversal between the subgroup comparison and this *actual* aggregated comparison. The claim that the paradox does not occur is false. The advice to hide subgroup details is precisely what causes the misinterpretation and is the opposite of the correct solution.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Aggregated rates are $p_A = 0.635$ and $p_B = 0.865$, so the dashboard correctly shows District Beta as superior; there is no paradox since the overall bars are definitive. To guard against misinterpretation, collapse the subgroups into one and apply moving-average smoothing with a logarithmic axis for all districts.**\n- **Analysis:** This option fundamentally misunderstands Simpson's paradox. While the calculation of the aggregated rates is numerically correct, the conclusion that there is \"no paradox\" because the bars are \"definitive\" is flawed. The entire point of the paradox is that a mathematically correct aggregate figure can lead to a substantively wrong conclusion. The proposed safeguard to \"collapse the subgroups\" is what creates the problem in the first place. Smoothing and logarithmic axes are techniques used to solve other types of data visualization problems and are not relevant to addressing confounding variables.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. District Alpha’s subgroup rates are $0.60$ and $0.95$, and District Beta’s subgroup rates are $0.50$ and $0.90$ (since $55/100 \\approx 0.50$). The aggregated rates are close, so any reversal is due to selection bias; the dashboard should exclude small subgroups (e.g., remove any subgroup with $n  200$) and show only overall rates, standardized to $z$-scores without subgroup breakdowns.**\n- **Analysis:** This option contains a calculation error: $55/100$ is exactly $0.55$, not approximately $0.50$. The statement that the aggregated rates ($0.635$ and $0.865$) are \"close\" is false; a difference of $23$ percentage points is very large in a public health context. The proposed safeguards are counterproductive. Excluding subgroups based on an arbitrary size threshold can discard critical information. Showing only overall rates is the root of the problem. Standardizing to z-scores would only rescale the misleading aggregated figures and would not correct for the underlying confounding.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4981543"}]}
