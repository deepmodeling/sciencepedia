We verify this condition for each group.\n\nFor the local-agenda proposals: $N_{L,sub} = 12$ and $S_L = 6$. Since $12 \\ge 6$, the condition is met. The number of accepted local-agenda proposals, $N_{L,acc}$, is therefore equal to the number of reserved slots.\n$$N_{L,acc} = S_L = 6$$\n\nFor the external-led proposals: $N_{E,sub} = 8$ and $S_E = 4$. Since $8 \\ge 4$, the condition is met. The number of accepted external-led proposals, $N_{E,acc}$, is therefore equal to the number of reserved slots.\n$$N_{E,acc} = S_E = 4$$\n\nNext, we compute the selection rate for each group using the definition $R = \\frac{N_{acc}}{N_{sub}}$.\n\nThe selection rate for local-agenda proposals is:\n$$R_L = \\frac{N_{L,acc}}{N_{L,sub}} = \\frac{6}{12} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThe selection rate for external-led proposals is:\n$$R_E = \\frac{N_{E,acc}}{N_{E,sub}} = \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the selection parity ratio, $P$, which is defined as the ratio of the local-agenda selection rate to the external-led selection rate.\n$$P = \\frac{R_L}{R_E}$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated selection rates:\n$$P = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 1$$\n\nThe result is an exact integer, $1$.
