## Introduction
The call to "decolonize global health" has grown from a marginal critique to a central challenge for a field grappling with its history and enduring inequities. While widely invoked, the term often lacks a precise, operational definition, creating a gap between aspirational rhetoric and concrete action. This article addresses that gap by providing a rigorous framework for both understanding and actively dismantling colonial legacies in contemporary health research and practice.

Over the next three chapters, you will move from theory to application. The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, establishes a foundational vocabulary, defining concepts like 'coloniality of power' and explaining the institutional and narrative mechanisms that reproduce it. The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, demonstrates how these principles are operationalized to redesign research partnerships, reform data governance, and forge connections with fields like implementation science and economics. Finally, the third chapter, **Hands-On Practices**, offers practical exercises to build skills in budget analysis, priority setting, and [policy evaluation](@entry_id:136637). This journey begins with understanding the deep structures of power that shape our field.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Following the introduction to the historical context of decolonizing global health, this chapter delves into the core principles and mechanisms that define and sustain coloniality in contemporary health practice and research. To move from a general critique to a rigorous analysis, we must first develop a precise vocabulary and a set of analytical tools. This chapter provides that foundation by defining the nature of colonial power, explaining how it is reproduced, identifying how it manifests in modern global health, and outlining the foundational principles for a truly decolonial praxis.

### The Enduring Structure: From Colonialism to Coloniality of Power

A common misconception is to equate the project of decolonization with the historical process of ending formal colonial rule. While related, the focus of decolonizing global health is on a more insidious and persistent structure: **coloniality of power**. This concept, central to decolonial theory, refers to the enduring hierarchies of race, knowledge, authority, and labor that were established during the colonial era but persist long after the formal dissolution of empires. To grasp this distinction, it is useful to differentiate between related historical forms of domination.

Consider a framework for classifying different modes of external control based on observable indicators [@problem_id:4972078]. Let us define a direct territorial governance indicator, $T$, which is $1$ if an external power holds formal sovereignty and $0$ otherwise. Let another indicator, $C_{pol}$, be $1$ if binding policy conditionalities are tied to funding or aid, and $0$ otherwise.

*   **Colonialism** is defined by direct rule and formal sovereignty. Its defining feature is thus $T=1$. A colonial medical service, for example, operates under the direct administrative control of an external government.

*   **Neocolonialism** describes a post-independence state of indirect control, often exercised through economic or policy leverage. Its signature is the absence of direct rule ($T=0$) but the presence of coercive conditionalities ($C_{pol}=1$), such as structural adjustment programs that dictate a nation's health spending in exchange for loans.

*   **Imperialism** involves dominance and extraction without formal annexation ($T=0$) and without overt policy coercion ($C_{pol}=0$). Its presence is revealed through other indicators, such as a high degree of external control over knowledge production and a net extraction of resources, even within seemingly collaborative projects.

Coloniality is the logic that underpins all these forms and outlives them. It is not an event, but a matrix of power that continues to structure the world. In global health, this translates into a [causal structure](@entry_id:159914) that produces and sustains health inequities. We can model coloniality of power, $C$, as a **structural determinant of health** operating at the macro-level (global political economy, donor governance) and meso-level (national institutions, health systems). This upstream cause shapes the **proximal social determinants of health**, $P$, which are the immediate conditions people experience, such as housing quality, occupational hazards, or local clinic access. The causal chain can be represented as $C \to P \to H$, where $H$ represents health outcomes like disease incidence [@problem_id:4972093]. This model clarifies that interventions focusing only on proximal determinants $P$ without addressing the underlying structural cause $C$ are likely to have limited or unstable effects, as the root causes of inequity remain untouched.

To analyze this structure, we must dissect the nature of power itself. In the context of global health, power, $P$, can be understood as a composite of three distinct but interrelated forms [@problem_id:4972080]:

1.  **Epistemic Power ($p_e$)**: This is the authority to define what counts as valid knowledge, evidence, and theory. It determines whose expertise is valued, which research methods are considered rigorous, and which problems are deemed worthy of scientific inquiry.

2.  **Agenda-Setting Power ($p_a$)**: This is the authority to frame problems, set priorities, and make decisions about which health issues receive attention and funding. It is the power to decide what is on the table and, just as importantly, what is not.

3.  **Material Power ($p_m$)**: This is the control over financial resources, infrastructure, technology, and procurement. It is the power to fund, build, and supply.

Coloniality of power in global health is characterized by a profound asymmetry where epistemic power ($p_e$) and agenda-setting power ($p_a$) are concentrated in institutions of the Global North (High-Income Countries, or HICs), while institutions in the Global South (Low- and Middle-Income Countries, or LMICs) are often relegated to the roles of implementation and data provision, even when they manage significant on-the-ground material resources.

### Mechanisms of Reproduction: Path Dependency and Narrative Framing

Colonial structures do not persist by accident; they are actively and passively reproduced through specific mechanisms. Two of the most powerful are institutional [path dependency](@entry_id:186326) and narrative framing.

**Path dependency** is a concept from historical institutionalism that explains how early choices and events can constrain future possibilities, creating self-reinforcing trajectories. In global health, a clear genealogy can be traced that demonstrates this process [@problem_id:4972112].

The lineage often begins with **tropical medicine**, an enterprise developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries primarily to serve the needs of colonial armies and economic ventures. Its approach was inherently vertical—targeting specific diseases like malaria or yellow fever that impeded colonial operations. This institutional model was later adopted and globalized by philanthropic organizations like the Rockefeller Foundation's International Health Division, which exported these vertical "campaign" templates and used conditional grants to shape schools of public health. This process created powerful self-reinforcing mechanisms: **standardization** of the vertical model as the default approach and **professional socialization** of generations of public health leaders trained in this paradigm.

This path set the stage for the architecture of the major global health initiatives (GHIs) of the 2000s. Faced with health crises, the well-trodden institutional path was the vertical, disease-specific model. The structure of these GHIs—with earmarked, performance-based funding and indicator-driven accountability—is the modern expression of this legacy. This model generates **increasing returns** by attracting massive donor funding due to its promise of clear, measurable results, further entrenching its dominance over comprehensive, horizontal approaches like the primary health care vision articulated at Alma-Ata in 1978. This trajectory perfectly illustrates the reproduction of coloniality: external agenda-setting ($p_a$) and upward accountability to foreign centers of power remain the norm.

A second key mechanism is **narrative framing**. The language used to describe global health problems is not neutral; it actively shapes how we understand causality and agency. A particularly pernicious form is **deficit framing**, which can be diagnosed by analyzing a narrative's agency attribution and inclusion of structural context [@problem_id:4972086]. A deficit-framed narrative locates the cause of a problem and the responsibility for its solution primarily within the affected community, often implying a lack, failure, or behavioral flaw (e.g., "they are non-compliant," "they lack education"). This approach simultaneously erases the broader structural context of policy, political economy, and history.

In contrast, a rigorous **problem specification** grounded in a decolonial ethic does the opposite. It explicitly integrates structural determinants, analyzing how systems, policies, and historical legacies constrain choices and produce vulnerability. It attributes agency not just to individuals but to the institutions and power structures that shape their environment. By learning to distinguish between these narrative forms, we can unmask the subtle ways colonial logic—blaming the victim while rendering the system invisible—is reproduced in reports, funding proposals, and media coverage.

### Manifestations of Coloniality in Global Health Practice

The abstract structures of coloniality manifest in concrete, damaging ways across global health research and practice. Key domains of concern include the politics of knowledge, the governance of data, and the structure of partnerships.

#### Epistemic Injustice: The Devaluation of Knowledge

The concentration of epistemic power ($p_e$) in the Global North leads to various forms of **epistemic injustice**, a term from social epistemology that describes wrongs done to people in their capacity as knowers. We can identify at least three distinct types [@problem_id:4972083].

**Testimonial injustice** occurs when a speaker's credibility is unjustly deflated due to prejudice against their social identity. For example, when an ethics committee dismisses the accounts of traditional healers as "inherently unreliable" without engaging with the specific content or the study's methodological safeguards, they are devaluing testimony based on the speakers' identity as "traditional" rather than on a reasoned critique. This is distinct from ordinary scholarly disagreement, which involves content-specific critique based on consistently applied standards.

**Hermeneutical injustice** is a structural problem that occurs when a gap in shared interpretive resources prevents a group from making sense of their own experiences within dominant frameworks. In a study on postnatal mental health, for instance, a mismatch between Western clinical diagnostic categories and local "idioms of distress" represents such a gap. This injustice is compounded when institutional policies—such as requiring only English-language transcripts or excluding qualitative data—actively prevent these local understandings from being heard or integrated, leaving the community at a disadvantage in having their reality understood and represented.

**Epistemicide** is the most extreme form: the structural suppression, de-legitimization, or erasure of entire knowledge systems. This does not happen through a single act but through institutional rules and practices that systematically invalidate alternative ways of knowing. A journal policy that considers only Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) as primary evidence, for example, can contribute to epistemicide by rendering knowledge generated through Indigenous methodologies or qualitative inquiry illegitimate, effectively erasing it from the landscape of "valid" science.

#### Data Colonialism: The New Frontier of Extraction

In the digital age, data has become a primary resource, and its governance is a new site of colonial struggle. The principle of **data sovereignty** asserts the inherent right of peoples and communities—particularly Indigenous nations—to govern the collection, ownership, access, and use of health data about them. This is a principle of collective rights and self-determination [@problem_id:4972075].

This has led to the development of ethical frameworks that go beyond purely technical standards. The **FAIR Principles** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) are technical guidelines to make data more discoverable and useful. However, FAIR is agnostic about power and ethics; data can be FAIR yet exploitative. To address this, the **CARE Principles** (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) were developed. CARE is a people-centric framework that complements FAIR by centering community governance, collective rights, and equitable benefit. The goal is for data to be both CARE and FAIR.

When these principles are violated, we encounter **data colonialism**. This can be defined as a practice that systematically extracts data from a population to generate value for external actors, sustained by profound asymmetries in power and benefit, and legitimized through ethically inadequate consent mechanisms [@problem_id:4972088]. For example, a partnership where a tech firm collects health data via a mobile app, commercializes predictive models from it for foreign markets, provides only limited dashboards back to the community, and relies on a non-negotiable, English-only "click-through" consent form is a textbook case of data colonialism. De-identification of data does not mitigate this harm, as the injustice lies in the extractive relationship and the inequitable distribution of power and benefit, not just the violation of individual privacy.

#### Inequitable Partnerships: The Illusion of Collaboration

The language of "partnership" is ubiquitous in global health, but it often masks deeply asymmetrical power relations. A crucial distinction must be made between **agenda control** and **implementation control** [@problem_id:4972087].

**Agenda control** involves decision-making rights over the "upstream," strategic aspects of a research project. This includes topic selection ($d_1$), problem framing and epistemic positioning ($d_2$), funding and budget allocation ($d_3$), methodological design ($d_4$), the analysis plan ($d_7$), and authorship and dissemination strategy ($d_8$). These are the choices that determine what knowledge is produced and how it is valued.

**Implementation control**, by contrast, involves decision rights over the "downstream," operational aspects of execution. This includes site access logistics ($d_5$), data collection operations ($d_6$), and program roll-out ($d_9$).

Many conventional global health partnerships exhibit a colonial division of labor: agenda control is retained by HIC institutions, while LMIC "partners" are granted only implementation control. They are responsible for facilitating access to populations and collecting data but have little say in the fundamental questions, methods, or interpretation. A truly equitable partnership requires the explicit and intentional sharing of agenda control, transforming LMIC collaborators from subcontractors into genuine intellectual leaders.

### Foundational Principles for Decolonial Praxis

Understanding these principles and mechanisms is the first step. The second is embracing a praxis—a cycle of reflection and action—grounded in a new set of foundational principles.

First, it is critical to understand the goal. Decolonizing global health is not synonymous with **localization** (shifting operational tasks) or simply achieving **global health equity** (fairer outcomes within the current system). While both are important, decolonization is a more profound project aimed at dismantling the structural basis of coloniality by fundamentally reconfiguring power. It is about the equitable redistribution of all three forms of power: epistemic ($p_e$), agenda-setting ($p_a$), and material ($p_m$) [@problem_id:4972080].

Second, this work begins with the researcher themselves. The myth of the detached, objective, "view from nowhere" observer is a pillar of epistemic dominance. **Reflexivity**, a core tenet of decolonial and critical methodologies, requires researchers to turn their analytical gaze upon themselves. Drawing on standpoint theory and reflexive sociology, this involves systematically examining how one's own social location, identity, training, interests, and relationship to power shape every analytical choice [@problem_id:4972101].

A practical tool for this is the **positionality statement**. By explicitly stating their standpoint and interpretive lens, a researcher makes their own priors and potential biases transparent. In doing so, they convert previously implicit, unacknowledged "researcher degrees of freedom"—the hidden choices that can alter interpretations—into acknowledged constraints. This does not eliminate subjectivity but makes it accountable, fostering a more honest and rigorous science. It is a critical act of intellectual humility that challenges epistemic arrogance and opens the door for more equitable and trustworthy knowledge production.
