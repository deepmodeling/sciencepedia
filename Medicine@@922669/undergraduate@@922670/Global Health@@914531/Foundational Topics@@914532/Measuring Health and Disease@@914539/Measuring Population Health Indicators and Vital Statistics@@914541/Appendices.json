Age heaping, a common reporting bias where people tend to round their age to digits like $0$ and $5$, can significantly distort the population denominators used in age-specific rates. This practice provides hands-on experience with Whipple’s Index and Myers’ Blended Index, two standard tools used to quantify the extent of age heaping and ensure the integrity of your demographic analysis [@problem_id:4990605].", "problem": "A national census is used to construct age-specific rates. In error-free reporting, the terminal (last) digit distribution of single-year ages is expected to be uniform across digits $0$ through $9$ over broad adult ages, and the share of ages ending in either $0$ or $5$ is expected to be consistent with that uniformity. Age heaping, the tendency for respondents to prefer certain terminal digits (often $0$ and $5$), biases the denominators used in rate calculations.\n\nConsider a synthetic but internally consistent census enumeration in which the reported count at each single year of age $a$ from $a=10$ to $a=89$ is given by\n$$\nN(a) = 1000 + 200 \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{5 \\mid a},\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{1}_{5 \\mid a}$ equals $1$ if $5$ divides $a$ (that is, the terminal digit is $0$ or $5$) and equals $0$ otherwise. Assume these reported counts are the denominators available to compute age-specific rates.\n\nUsing only the base idea that in the absence of heaping the terminal digits are uniformly distributed and that heaping concentrates counts on preferred digits, do the following from first principles:\n- Compute Whipple’s index for ages $23$ through $62$ (inclusive), taking it as the ratio of the observed share of ages ending in $0$ or $5$ to the expected share under uniform terminal digits, scaled in the conventional way so that an error-free situation yields $100$.\n- Compute Myers’ blended index over ages $10$ through $89$ (inclusive), taking it as one-half of the sum of the absolute deviations of the terminal-digit proportions from the uniform value across digits $0$ through $9$.\n\nRound both index values to four significant figures and express them as dimensionless decimals.
