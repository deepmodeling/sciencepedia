All necessary data for the calculation are provided, and the methodology aligns with standard practices in global health epidemiology for calculating Years of Life Lost (YLL) under the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) framework. The assumptions of no age-weighting and no time discounting are explicitly stated, which clarifies the calculation method. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe Years of Life Lost (YLL) is a measure of premature mortality. For a given age of death $a$, the YLL is calculated by multiplying the number of deaths at that age, $d(a)$, by the standard life expectancy at that age, $\\ell(a)$. The formula for the total YLL across all age groups is the sum of the YLL for each individual age group.\n\nLet $i$ be an index for each age group provided. The age of death is $a_i$, the number of deaths is $d_i$, and the standard remaining life expectancy is $\\ell(a_i)$. The total YLL is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\text{Total YLL} = \\sum_{i} d_i \\times \\ell(a_i)\n$$\nThe problem specifies that no age-weighting or time discounting should be applied, which corresponds directly to this simple summation formula.\n\nWe will now compute the YLL for each age group using the provided data:\n- For age $a_1 = 1$ year:\nThe number of deaths is $d_1 = 12$, and the standard life expectancy is $\\ell(1) = 85.0$ years.\n$$\n\\text{YLL}_1 = d_1 \\times \\ell(1) = 12 \\times 85.0 = 1020 \\text{ years}\n$$\n\n- For age $a_2 = 15$ years:\nThe number of deaths is $d_2 = 8$, and the standard life expectancy is $\\ell(15) = 71.6$ years.\n$$\n\\text{YLL}_2 = d_2 \\times \\ell(15) = 8 \\times 71.6 = 572.8 \\text{ years}\n$$\n\n- For age $a_3 = 30$ years:\nThe number of deaths is $d_3 = 20$, and the standard life expectancy is $\\ell(30) = 57.1$ years.\n$$\n\\text{YLL}_3 = d_3 \\times \\ell(30) = 20 \\times 57.1 = 1142 \\text{ years}\n$$\n\n- For age $a_4 = 50$ years:\nThe number of deaths is $d_4 = 45$, and the standard life expectancy is $\\ell(50) = 36.0$ years.\n$$\n\\text{YLL}_4 = d_4 \\times \\ell(50) = 45 \\times 36.0 = 1620 \\text{ years}\n$$\n\n- For age $a_5 = 70$ years:\nThe number of deaths is $d_5 = 90$, and the standard life expectancy is $\\ell(70) = 18.4$ years.\n$$\n\\text{YLL}_5 = d_5 \\times \\ell(70) = 90 \\times 18.4 = 1656 \\text{ years}\n$$\n\n- For age $a_6 = 85$ years:\nThe number of deaths is $d_6 = 120$, and the standard life expectancy is $\\ell(85) = 9.2$ years.\n$$\n\\text{YLL}_6 = d_6 \\times \\ell(85) = 120 \\times 9.2 = 1104 \\text{ years}\n$$\n\nThe total YLL for the population is the sum of these individual values:\n$$\n\\text{Total YLL} = \\text{YLL}_1 + \\text{YLL}_2 + \\text{YLL}_3 + \\text{YLL}_4 + \\text{YLL}_5 + \\text{YLL}_6\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Total YLL} = 1020 + 572.8 + 1142 + 1620 + 1656 + 1104 = 7114.8 \\text{ years}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The value $7114.8$ has five significant figures. The fourth significant digit is $4$. The following digit is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$\n\\text{Total YLL} \\approx 7115 \\text{ years}\n$$\n\nQualitatively, the age distribution of deaths is a critical determinant of the total YLL. The YLL metric gives more weight to deaths that occur at younger ages because the remaining life expectancy, $\\ell(a)$, is highest for small $a$ and decreases monotonically. A death at a young age represents a greater loss of potential life than a death at an old age.\n\nThis principle is evident in the data. Although the number of deaths is highest in the oldest age groups ($90$ deaths at age $70$ and $120$ deaths at age $85$), these groups do not contribute to the total YLL in direct proportion to their death counts. The highest contribution to total YLL comes from the age group $a=70$ ($\\text{YLL}_5 = 1656$), closely followed by the age group $a=50$ ($\\text{YLL}_4 = 1620$). Notably, the mere $12$ deaths at age $1$ contribute $1020$ years to the total YLL, an average of $85.0$ years per death. In contrast, the $120$ deaths at age $85$ contribute a comparable $1104$ years in total, but this is only an average of $9.2$ years per death. Therefore, the age at which death occurs is as important as the number of deaths. A mortality profile skewed towards younger ages will result in a much higher YLL burden, even if the total number of deaths is the same as in a population where deaths are concentrated in old age. The YLL framework thus shifts the focus of public health from merely counting deaths to quantifying the magnitude of premature death.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7115}$$", "id": "5001651"}, {"introduction": "Complementing the measurement of mortality, the Years Lived with Disability ($YLD$) metric quantifies the non-fatal burden of disease, capturing the health loss from living with illnesses and injuries.

The secondary tasks are to derive the formula used and to discuss the impact of changing the severity distribution.\n\nStarting from the conceptual definition provided, the prevalence-based YLD is the number of prevalent cases of a health outcome multiplied by a disability weight ($DW$) that quantifies the severity of the health loss on a scale from $0$ (perfect health) to $1$ (death). For a reference period of one year, the YLD for a single sequela $s$ in a specific age group $a$ is given by:\n$$ \\text{YLD}_{a,s} = I_{a,s} \\times DW_s $$\nwhere $I_{a,s}$ is the number of prevalent cases of sequela $s$ in age group $a$, and $DW_s$ is the disability weight for sequela $s$.\n\nThe number of prevalent cases, $I_{a,s}$, is the product of the sequela's prevalence, $P_{a,s}$, and the population size of the age group, $N_a$.\n$$ I_{a,s} = P_{a,s} \\times N_a $$\nSubstituting this into the YLD equation gives:\n$$ \\text{YLD}_{a,s} = P_{a,s} \\times N_a \\times DW_s $$\n\nThe problem states that the sequelae are mutually exclusive.

The total prevalence in that age group is $P_{a,\\text{total}} = \\sum_s P_{a,s}$. If $P_{a,\\text{total}}$ is held constant, changing the severity distribution means reapportioning the prevalences $P_{a,s}$ among the sequelae while their sum remains fixed.\nThe YLD expression is a linear combination of the prevalences, where the coefficients are the disability weights $DW_s$. The disability weights are ordered by severity: $DW_{\\text{mild}} (0.06) < DW_{\\text{moderate}} (0.22) < DW_{\\text{severe}} (0.45)$.\nIf the severity distribution shifts towards more severe sequelae, this means that the prevalence values $P_{a,s}$ associated with larger disability weights (e.g., $DW_{\\text{severe}}$) increase, while the prevalences associated with smaller disability weights (e.g., $DW_{\\text{mild}}$) decrease to maintain the constant total prevalence. Because more of the prevalence \"mass\" is being multiplied by larger coefficients in the summation $\\sum_{s} P_{a,s}DW_s$, the value of the sum will necessarily increase. Consequently, the YLD for that age group, and thus the total YLD, will increase. Conversely, a shift towards a milder distribution of sequelae would decrease the YLD.

Crude Mortality Rates and Simpson's Paradox**\n\nFrom first principles, the crude mortality rate (CMR) for a given country is the weighted average of its age-specific mortality rates, where the weights are the proportions of its own population in each age group.\nThe formula is:\n$$ \\text{CMR}_C = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} m_{i,C} \\cdot p_{i,C} $$\n\nFor Country A:\n$$ \\text{CMR}_A = m_{1,A} \\cdot p_{1,A} + m_{2,A} \\cdot p_{2,A} + m_{3,A} \\cdot p_{3,A} $$\n$$ \\text{CMR}_A = (60 \\times 0.50) + (220 \\times 0.45) + (3200 \\times 0.05) $$\n$$ \\text{CMR}_A = 30 + 99 + 160 = 289 $$\nThe crude mortality rate for Country A is $289$ per $100{,}000$ person-years.\n\nFor Country B:\n$$ \\text{CMR}_B = m_{1,B} \\cdot p_{1,B} + m_{2,B} \\cdot p_{2,B} + m_{3,B} \\cdot p_{3,B} $$\n$$ \\text{CMR}_B = (40 \\times 0.20) + (180 \\times 0.60) + (2900 \\times 0.20) $$\n$$ \\text{CMR}_B = 8 + 108 + 580 = 696 $$\nThe crude mortality rate for Country B is $696$ per $100{,}000$ person-years.\n\nComparing the crude rates, we find that $\\text{CMR}_A = 289$ is much lower than $\\text{CMR}_B = 696$. This is a classic example of Simpson's paradox: the trend observed in the aggregated data ($\\text{CMR}_A < \\text{CMR}_B$) is the reverse of the trend observed in all subgroups ($m_{i,A} > m_{i,B}$ for all $i$).\n\nThe paradox arises due to the confounding effect of age structure. Mortality rates are extremely high in the oldest age group ($\\geq 65$). Country B has a much older population structure, with $20\\%$ of its population in this high-mortality group, compared to only $5\\%$ in Country A. This large weight on the highest mortality rate inflates Country B's overall crude rate, masking the fact that its underlying age-specific mortality risks are lower than Country A's.\n\n**2. Age-Standardized Mortality Rates**\n\nDirect age standardization resolves this paradox by calculating what the mortality rate in each country *would be* if they both had the same age structure as a hypothetical standard population.

This result is consistent with the fact that mortality rates are higher in Country A for every age group.\n\n**3.
