A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe total Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), denoted as $Q$, are defined by the integral of the instantaneous utility function $u(t)$ over the specified time horizon $[0, T]$.\n$$ Q = \\int_{0}^{T} u(t) \\, dt $$\nThe utility function $u(t)$ is given as a piecewise constant function:\n$$\nu(t) =\n\\begin{cases}\nu_1  \\text{for } 0 \\le t \\le t_1 \\\\\nu_2  \\text{for } t_1  t \\le T\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $u_1$ and $u_2$ are constants. To evaluate the integral, we must split it at the point of discontinuity, $t_1$:\n$$ Q = \\int_{0}^{t_1} u(t) \\, dt + \\int_{t_1}^{T} u(t) \\, dt $$\nSubstituting the constant values of $u(t)$ into the respective intervals yields:\n$$ Q = \\int_{0}^{t_1} u_1 \\, dt + \\int_{t_1}^{T} u_2 \\, dt $$\nSince $u_1$ and $u_2$ are constants with respect to the integration variable $t$, they can be factored out of the integrals:\n$$ Q = u_1 \\int_{0}^{t_1} dt + u_2 \\int_{t_1}^{T} dt $$\nPerforming the integrations gives:\n$$ Q = u_1 [t]_{0}^{t_1} + u_2 [t]_{t_1}^{T} $$\n$$ Q = u_1 (t_1 - 0) + u_2 (T - t_1) $$\nThis leads to the final derived expression for the total QALYs for this piecewise-constant trajectory:\n$$ Q = u_1 t_1 + u_2 (T - t_1) $$\n**Interpretation**\nThis expression has a clear geometric interpretation as the area under the curve of the utility function $u(t)$ from $t=0$ to $t=T$. It is the sum of the areas of two rectangles:\n1.  The first rectangle has a height of $u_1$ and a width of $t_1$. Its area is $u_1 t_1$, representing the QALYs accrued during the first, higher-utility phase.\n2.  The second rectangle has a height of $u_2$ and a width of $(T - t_1)$. Its area is $u_2(T - t_1)$, representing the QALYs accrued during the second, lower-utility phase.\nThus, the total QALYs are the sum of the utility values for each health state, each weighted by the duration of time spent in that state. This is the essence of valuing \"time-weighted health states\".\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\nThe given parameter values are:\n- $u_1 = 0.82$\n- $u_2 = 0.68$\n- $T = 2$ years\n- $t_1 = 9$ months\n\nFor consistency, all time variables must be in the same unit.

The calculated value of $1.465$ already consists of four significant figures ($1$, $4$, $6$, $5$). Therefore, no further rounding is necessary.\n\nThe total QALYs accrued by the patient over the $2$-year horizon is $1.465$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.465}\n$$", "id": "5053286"}, {"introduction": "While the basic area-under-the-curve model is a powerful starting point, real-world health economic evaluations often require more nuance.
