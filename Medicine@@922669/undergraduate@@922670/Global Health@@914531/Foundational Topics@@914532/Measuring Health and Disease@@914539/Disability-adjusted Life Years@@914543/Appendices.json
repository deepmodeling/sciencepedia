The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of public health metrics, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is objective in its formulation.\n\nThe calculation of YLL is based on the number of deaths and the standard life expectancy at the age of death. The formula for YLL for a specific age group is given by:\n$$\nYLL = N \\times L\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of deaths in that age group and $L$ is the standard remaining life expectancy for that age.\n\nThe total YLL for a population is the sum of the YLL contributions from all relevant age strata. In this problem, we have two strata.\n\nLet us denote the variables for the first stratum (age group centered at $50$ years) with a subscript $1$, and for the second stratum (age group centered at $70$ years) with a subscript $2$.\n\nThe givens are:\nFor the first stratum (age $50$):\n-   Number of deaths, $N_1 = 1000$.\n-   Standard remaining life expectancy, $L_1 = 30$ years.\n\nFor the second stratum (age $70$):\n-   Number of deaths, $N_2 = 500$.\n-   Standard remaining life expectancy, $L_2 = 15$ years.\n\nFirst, we calculate the YLL for each stratum individually.\n\nFor the age group centered at $50$ years:\n$$\nYLL_1 = N_1 \\times L_1 = 1000 \\times 30 = 30000 \\text{ person-years}\n$$\n\nFor the age group centered at $70$ years:\n$$\nYLL_2 = N_2 \\times L_2 = 500 \\times 15 = 7500 \\text{ person-years}\n$$\n\nThe total YLL across both strata is the sum of the YLL from each stratum:\n$$\nYLL_{total} = YLL_1 + YLL_2\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\nYLL_{total} = 30000 + 7500 = 37500 \\text{ person-years}\n$$\nThe total YLL across these two strata is $37500$ person-years.\n\nThe second part of the task is to interpret how the age structure of deaths affects the burden.\nWe observe the following:\n-   The number of deaths in the younger stratum (age $50$) is $N_1 = 1000$, which is double the number of deaths in the older stratum (age $70$), where $N_2 = 500$.\n-   The YLL contributed by the younger stratum is $YLL_1 = 30000$, while the YLL contributed by the older stratum is $YLL_2 = 7500$.\n-   The ratio of YLL contributions is $YLL_1 / YLL_2 = 30000 / 7500 = 4$.\n\nThis comparison elucidates a core principle of the YLL metric. Although the number of deaths in the age $50$ group is only twice that of the age $70$ group, its contribution to the total mortality burden (in terms of YLL) is four times greater. This is because each death at age $50$ corresponds to a loss of $30$ years of potential life according to the standard life expectancy, whereas each death at age $70$ corresponds to a loss of $15$ years. The YLL metric inherently assigns a greater weight to deaths that occur at younger ages, reflecting the larger number of life years forgone. Therefore, the age structure of mortality is a critical factor in determining the overall burden of premature death; a population with a higher proportion of deaths among younger individuals will have a substantially higher YLL, and thus a greater DALY burden from mortality, than a population with the same number of deaths concentrated in older age groups.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{37500}\n$$", "id": "4973896"}, {"introduction": "Complementing the measure of mortality, the Years Lived with Disability (YLD) metric quantifies the burden of non-fatal health outcomes.

Mastering this distinction is key to accurately assessing the morbidity component of the total disease burden.", "problem": "A health ministry seeks to quantify nonfatal disease burden in the current calendar year using the Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) framework, focusing on its nonfatal component, Years Lived with Disability (YLD). Years Lived with Disability (YLD) is defined as the aggregate, across persons living with a health condition during a specified time window, of the time lived with disability in that window weighted by the corresponding Disability Weight (DW). In other words, for each individual, one integrates the time lived with the condition within the window, multiplies by the appropriate DW for that condition and severity, and then sums over individuals. Assume no comorbidity interactions, no time discounting, and no age weighting. Consider two conditions with the following epidemiological summaries for the current year:\n\n- Chronic condition: there are $P=20{,}000$ persons prevalent at mid-year with the condition; assume they are symptomatic for the entire year. The Disability Weight (DW) is constant at $DW=0.3$ for all prevalent cases throughout the year, and mortality from this condition is negligible.\n- Acute condition: there are $I=5{,}000$ incident symptomatic episodes over the year; each episode has constant Disability Weight $DW=0.5$ while symptomatic and has a mean duration $D=0.1$ years (approximately $36.5$ days).

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of epidemiology and public health, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objective in its language. The problem requires the calculation of Years Lived with Disability (YLD) for a chronic and an acute condition based on a foundational definition and provided data.\n\nThe foundational definition of Years Lived with Disability (YLD) is the aggregation of time lived with a disability, weighted by a Disability Weight (DW). For a population over a specific time period (here, one year), this can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\text{YLD} = \\sum_{i \\in \\text{cases}} \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} DW_i(t) \\, dt\n$$\nwhere the sum is over all individuals with the condition, the integral is over the time window of one year, and $DW_i(t)$ is the disability weight for individual $i$ at time $t$. Given the problem's simplifying assumptions (constant $DW$ for each condition, no comorbidities, etc.), this principle can be simplified for population-level calculations. The standard epidemiological approach is to use prevalence to estimate the burden of chronic conditions and incidence for acute conditions.\n\nFirst, we calculate the YLD for the chronic condition.\nFor a chronic condition with stable prevalence and negligible mortality, the number of people living with the condition throughout the year can be approximated by the mid-year prevalence, $P$. The problem states that these individuals are symptomatic for the entire year, so the duration of disability within the one-year window is $1$ year for each person. The disability weight is constant at $DW_{\\text{chronic}}$. The summation and integration thus simplify to a product:\n$$\n\\text{YLD}_{\\text{chronic}} = (\\text{Number of prevalent cases}) \\times (\\text{Duration of disability per case}) \\times (\\text{Disability Weight})\n$$\nThe given values are:\n- Prevalence, $P = 20,000$ persons.\n- Duration, $T = 1$ year.\n- Disability Weight, $DW_{\\text{chronic}} = 0.3$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$\n\\text{YLD}_{\\text{chronic}} = P \\times T \\times DW_{\\text{chronic}} = 20,000 \\times 1 \\times 0.3 = 6,000 \\text{ years}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the YLD for the acute condition.\nFor an acute condition, YLD is calculated based on the number of new (incident) cases that occur during the year. Each case contributes to the total burden for its duration. The total burden is the sum of the disability from all incident episodes.\n$$\n\\text{YLD}_{\\text{acute}} = (\\text{Number of incident cases}) \\times (\\text{Mean duration of an episode}) \\times (\\text{Disability Weight})\n$$\nThe problem states that the entirety of each episode's disability occurs within the current calendar year, which simplifies the calculation by avoiding censored data at the year's boundaries. The given values are:\n- Incidence, $I = 5,000$ episodes.\n- Mean duration, $D = 0.1$ years.\n- Disability Weight, $DW_{\\text{acute}} = 0.5$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$\n\\text{YLD}_{\\text{acute}} = I \\times D \\times DW_{\\text{acute}} = 5,000 \\times 0.1 \\times 0.5 = 500 \\times 0.5 = 250 \\text{ years}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the results to be rounded to four significant figures.\nFor the chronic condition, $\\text{YLD}_{\\text{chronic}} = 6,000$. To express this value with four significant figures unambiguously, we use scientific notation: $6.000 \\times 10^3$.\nFor the acute condition, $\\text{YLD}_{\\text{acute}} = 250$. To express this with four significant figures, we write $250.0$. In scientific notation for consistency, this is $2.500 \\times 10^2$.\n\nFinally, we compare the two values to determine which condition contributes the larger nonfatal burden.\n$$\n\\text{YLD}_{\\text{chronic}} = 6,000 \\text{ years}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{YLD}_{\\text{acute}} = 250 \\text{ years}\n$$\nSince $6,000 > 250$, the chronic condition contributes a substantially larger nonfatal disease burden in the current year compared to the acute condition.\n\nThe pair of values $(\\text{YLD}_{\\text{chronic}},\\ \\text{YLD}_{\\text{acute}})$, rounded to four significant figures, is $(6.000 \\times 10^3, 2.500 \\times 10^2)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 6.000 \\times 10^{3} & 2.500 \\times 10^{2} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4973946"}, {"introduction": "To fully grasp the concept of the DALY as a measure of health loss, it is instructive to compare it with its conceptual counterpart, the Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY), which measures health lived.

The provided parameters are consistent and sufficient for a unique solution based on standard definitions in health economics and global health. We proceed with the derivation from first principles.\n\nThe Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) is a measure of health outcome that combines both the quantity and the quality of life lived. From first principles, for a time interval from $t=0$ to $t=T$, the total QALYs accumulated are given by the integral of the health-related quality of life utility function, $U(t)$, over that interval. The general form, including a discount rate $r$, would be $\\int_0^T U(t) e^{-rt} dt$. However, the problem specifies that time discounting is to be ignored, which is equivalent to setting the discount rate $r=0$.\n\nThe expression for QALYs is therefore:\n$$\n\\text{QALY} = \\int_{0}^{T} U(t) \\,dt\n$$\nThe problem states that the individual experiences a chronic illness over a duration of $T = 10$ years with a constant health-related quality of life utility $U = 0.7$.\nSubstituting these constant values into the integral:\n$$\n\\text{QALY} = \\int_{0}^{10} 0.7 \\,dt = 0.7 \\times [t]_{0}^{10} = 0.7 \\times (10 - 0)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{QALY} = 0.7 \\times 10 = 7\n$$\nThus, the total QALYs accumulated over the $10$-year period are $7$ years.\n\nThe Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) is a measure of overall disease burden, expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability, or early death. The DALY is calculated as the sum of two components: the Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to premature mortality, and the Years Lived with Disability (YLD). The problem specifies that age weighting and time discounting are to be ignored.\n$$\n\\text{DALY} = \\text{YLL} + \\text{YLD}\n$$\nThe YLL component quantifies the loss of life from premature death. The problem statement explicitly provides that there is \"no mortality during this period.\" Therefore, the Years of Life Lost are zero.\n$$\n\\text{YLL} = 0\n$$\nThe YLD component quantifies the years of healthy life lost due to living in states of less than full health. It is calculated by multiplying the duration of the disability by a disability weight, $DW$. For a non-constant disability weight $DW(t)$, the YLD is given by the integral:\n$$\n\\text{YLD} = \\int_{0}^{T} DW(t) \\,dt\n$$\nThe problem requires using a disability weight $DW$ that is consistent with the anchoring of the utility scale, where $U=1$ corresponds to full health and $U=0$ corresponds to death. In the standard framework for QALYs and DALYs, full health corresponds to a disability weight of $DW=0$, and a state equivalent to death corresponds to a disability weight of $DW=1$. This establishes a direct, inverse linear relationship between utility $U$ and disability weight $DW$:\n$$\nDW = 1 - U\n$$\nGiven the constant utility $U = 0.7$, the corresponding constant disability weight is:\n$$\nDW = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3\n$$\nNow we can calculate the YLD over the duration $T = 10$ years:\n$$\n\\text{YLD} = \\int_{0}^{10} 0.3 \\,dt = 0.3 \\times [t]_{0}^{10} = 0.3 \\times (10 - 0)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{YLD} = 0.3 \\times 10 = 3\n$$\nThe total DALYs incurred are the sum of YLL and YLD:\n$$\n\\text{DALY} = \\text{YLL} + \\text{YLD} = 0 + 3 = 3\n$$\nSo, the total DALYs incurred over the $10$-year period are $3$ years.\n\nThe computed values are $QALY = 7$ years and $DALY = 3$ years.\nIt is worth noting that for a given time period $T$ with constant morbidity and no mortality, the sum of QALYs and DALYs equals the total duration of the period:\n$$\n\\text{QALY} + \\text{DALY} = (U \\times T) + ((1 - U) \\times T) = (U + 1 - U) \\times T = T\n$$\nIn this case, $7 + 3 = 10$, which confirms the consistency of our calculations.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n7 & 3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4973913"}]}
