The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe method of direct standardization is used to compare rates between populations with different underlying structures (in this case, age structures of live births). The age-standardized MMR ($SMMR$) is a weighted average of the age-specific MMRs ($M_i$), where the weights are derived from the standard population's distribution of live births.\n\nThe formula for the age-standardized MMR is given by:\n$$ SMMR = \\frac{\\sum_{i} (\\text{Expected Deaths}_i)}{\\sum_{i} (\\text{Standard Population}_i)} \\times 100{,}000 $$\nThe expected number of deaths in age group $i$ is calculated by applying the age-specific mortality rate of the country to the number of live births in the standard population for that age group. The age-specific rate, $r_i$, is $M_i / 100{,}000$. Thus, expected deaths in group $i$ is $r_i \\times W_{S,i} = \\frac{M_i}{100{,}000} \\times W_{S,i}$.\nThe total expected deaths is $\\sum_i \\frac{M_i \\times W_{S,i}}{100{,}000}$. The total standard population is $\\sum_i W_{S,i}$.\nSubstituting these into the formula for $SMMR$:\n$$ SMMR = \\frac{\\sum_{i} \\frac{M_i \\times W_{S,i}}{100{,}000}}{\\sum_{i} W_{S,i}} \\times 100{,}000 $$\nThis simplifies to a weighted mean of the age-specific MMRs:\n$$ SMMR = \\frac{\\sum_{i} (M_i \\times W_{S,i})}{\\sum_{i} W_{S,i}} $$\nFirst, we calculate the total number of live births in the standard population, $W_{S,\\text{total}}$:\n$$ W_{S,\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{7} W_{S,i} = 120{,}000 + 260{,}000 + 280{,}000 + 200{,}000 + 100{,}000 + 35{,}000 + 5{,}000 $$\n$$ W_{S,\\text{total}} = 1{,}000{,}000 $$\nNext, we calculate the age-standardized MMR for Country A ($SMMR_A$).

It is scientifically grounded in the fields of biostatistics and epidemiology, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. It requires the application of the standard product-limit method (Kaplan-Meier estimator) to censored survival data, which is a formal and verifiable procedure.\n\nThe problem asks for the nonparametric product-limit estimate of the survival function at $t=1$ year, and from this, the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR). The product-limit estimator, also known as the Kaplan-Meier estimator, provides an estimate of the survival function $S(t) = P(T > t)$, where $T$ is the time to event (death). The estimate, denoted $\\hat{S}(t)$, is calculated from observed data that may include right-censored observations. The fundamental assumption is that censoring is non-informative, which is given in the problem statement.\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function is a step function that changes value only at the times of observed events (deaths). The formula for $\\hat{S}(t)$ is given by the product of conditional survival probabilities over intervals defined by the event times:\n$$\n\\hat{S}(t) = \\prod_{i: t_i \\le t} \\left(1 - \\frac{d_i}{n_i}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $t_i$ are the distinct times at which events (deaths) occurred, $d_i$ is the number of events at time $t_i$, and $n_i$ is the number of individuals at risk of the event just prior to time $t_i$. The set of individuals at risk comprises all subjects who have not yet experienced the event and have not been censored up to that point.\n\nFirst, we must order all observed times, for both deaths and censorings, to correctly determine the number at risk, $n_i$, at each death time. The cohort consists of $N=10$ infants. Let $\\delta=1$ denote a death and $\\delta=0$ denote a censored observation. The ordered data are:\n- $t = \\frac{1}{12}$: death ($\\delta=1$)\n- $t = \\frac{1}{6}$: censored ($\\delta=0$)\n- $t = \\frac{1}{4}$: death ($\\delta=1$)\n- $t = \\frac{5}{12}$: death ($\\delta=1$)\n- $t = \\frac{1}{2}$: censored ($\\delta=0$)\n- $t = \\frac{3}{4}$: censored ($\\delta=0$)\n- $t = \\frac{11}{12}$: death ($\\delta=1$)\n- $t = 1$: censored ($\\delta=0$, $3$ individuals)\n\nThe distinct death times are $t_1 = \\frac{1}{12}$, $t_2 = \\frac{1}{4}$, $t_3 = \\frac{5}{12}$, and $t_4 = \\frac{11}{12}$.

Since no deaths occur between $t=\\frac{11}{12}$ and $t=1$, the survival estimate remains constant over this interval. The censorship of $3$ infants at $t=1$ occurs at the end of the follow-up period and does not affect the calculation of $\\hat{S}(1)$ itself, as the product is taken over death times up to or equal to $t=1$.

In terms of the survival time random variable $T$, this is $P(T \\le 1)$. This probability is complementary to the survival function at $t=1$, which is $S(1) = P(T > 1)$.\nThus, $\\text{IMR} = 1 - S(1)$.\nUsing our product-limit estimate $\\hat{S}(1)$, we can estimate the IMR as:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{IMR}} = 1 - \\hat{S}(1)\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated value:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{IMR}} = 1 - \\frac{81}{160} = \\frac{160 - 81}{160} = \\frac{79}{160}\n$$\nTo obtain the final numerical value, we perform the division:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{IMR}} = \\frac{79}{160} = 0.49375\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
