All necessary data are provided, and the requested calculations are based on the standard, established principles of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) framework. The data values are plausible and dimensionally consistent. The problem is a direct application of epidemiological and public health quantitative methods.\n\nThe central metric is the disability-adjusted life year (DALY), which quantifies the total burden of disease. It is the sum of two components: Years of Life Lost due to premature mortality ($YLL$) and Years Lived with Disability ($YLD$).\nThe formula for DALYs for a specific cause is given by:\n$$DALY = YLL + YLD$$\nAll calculations will be performed per $100{,}000$ population, as the input data are provided in this format.\n\nThe components are calculated as follows, based on the problem's explicit conditions of no time discounting and no age-weighting:\n1.  Years of Life Lost ($YLL$): The product of the number of deaths and the standard life expectancy at the age of death.

The largest contributor was the communicable disease, lower respiratory infection, accounting for $4837.8$ DALYs, or approximately $51.8\\%$ of the total burden. The noncommunicable disease, ischemic heart disease, accounted for $3120$ DALYs ($33.4\\%$), and road injuries for $1377$ DALYs ($14.8\\%$).\nBy the year $2020$, the total burden of disease had decreased to $7955.775$ DALYs per $100{,}000$. However, its composition shifted dramatically. The burden from LRI fell sharply to $2718.9$ DALYs ($34.2\\%$), while the burden from IHD rose to $4030$ DALYs, becoming the dominant cause at $50.7\\%$ of the total burden. The burden from injuries remained relatively stable in its proportional contribution ($15.1\\%$). This inversion, where noncommunicable diseases overtake communicable diseases as the leading cause of health loss, is the defining characteristic of the epidemiological transition.\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio of total DALYs per $100{,}000$ in year $2020$ to that in year $2000$.\n$$Ratio = \\frac{DALY_{total, 2020}}{DALY_{total, 2000}} = \\frac{7955.775}{9334.8} \\approx 0.8522718$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the ratio is $0.8523$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8523}$$", "id": "5000180"}, {"introduction": "As a population's health improves, a curious thing can happen: the crude death rate ($CDR$) might not fall, or could even rise, due to population aging.
