It is scientifically grounded in the principles of demography and preventive medicine, is well-posed with all necessary data and definitions provided, and is objective in its requirements. The data are internally consistent and plausible for a population undergoing a demographic transition.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first principles. We must calculate the size of the three fundamental population groups as defined: children, the working-age population, and older adults.\n\nLet $P_{child}$ be the population of children, defined as those aged $0$–$14$ years.\nLet $P_{work}$ be the working-age population, defined as those aged $15$–$64$ years.\nLet $P_{old}$ be the population of older adults, defined as those aged $65$ years and above.\n\nFrom the provided data, we sum the counts for the respective age bands:\n\nThe child population, $P_{child}$, is the sum of the counts for age bands $0$–$4$, $5$–$9$, and $10$–$14$:\n$$P_{child} = 95,000 + 100,000 + 98,000 = 293,000$$\n\nThe working-age population, $P_{work}$, is the sum of the counts for age bands from $15$–$19$ through $60$–$64$:\n$$P_{work} = 92,000 + 90,000 + 88,000 + 85,000 + 84,000 + 83,000 + 82,000 + 81,000 + 80,000 + 78,000 = 843,000$$\n\nThe older-adult population, $P_{old}$, is the sum of the counts for age bands $65$–$69$, $70$–$74$, $75$–$79$, and $80$ and above:\n$$P_{old} = 76,000 + 70,000 + 62,000 + 55,000 = 263,000$$\n\nWith these population counts, we can derive the three required dependency ratios from their standard definitions.\n\nThe child dependency ratio ($CDR$) is the ratio of the child population to the working-age population:\n$$CDR = \\frac{P_{child}}{P_{work}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$CDR = \\frac{293,000}{843,000} \\approx 0.34756820877...$$\n\nThe old-age dependency ratio ($OADR$) is the ratio of the older-adult population to the working-age population:\n$$OADR = \\frac{P_{old}}{P_{work}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$OADR = \\frac{263,000}{843,000} \\approx 0.3119810199...$$\n\nThe total dependency ratio ($TDR$) is the ratio of the total dependent population (children and older adults) to the working-age population. It is the sum of the child and old-age dependency ratios:\n$$TDR = \\frac{P_{child} + P_{old}}{P_{work}} = CDR + OADR$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$TDR = \\frac{293,000 + 263,000}{843,000} = \\frac{556,000}{843,000} \\approx 0.65954922894...$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding each ratio to four significant figures.\n$CDR \\approx 0.3476$\n$OADR \\approx 0.3120$\n$TDR \\approx 0.6595$\n\nBased on these results, we provide the systems-level interpretation for preventive service delivery. The child dependency ratio ($CDR \\approx 0.3476$) and the old-age dependency ratio ($OADR \\approx 0.3120$) are of comparable magnitude. This demographic structure, characterized by a constrictive base (the $0$-$4$ age group is smaller than the $5$-$9$ age group) and a significant elderly population, is indicative of a late-stage demographic transition. The district faces a \"dual burden\" of dependency, where the needs of the young and the old both exert substantial claims on societal resources, including the healthcare system.\n\nThis balance fundamentally shapes preventive service priorities. A strategy focused solely on traditional maternal and child health (e.g., childhood immunizations, nutritional support) is insufficient. The substantial $OADR$ signals a large and growing burden of chronic, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and age-related conditions.\n\nTherefore, the district’s preventive medicine portfolio must be dual-pronged:\n1.  **Maintain and optimize child-focused services:** While the relative proportion of children is declining, core services like comprehensive immunization programs, developmental screening, and injury prevention remain critical public health functions. The absolute number of children ($293,000$) is still large.\n2.  **Aggressively expand older-adult-focused services:** The near-equal weight of the $OADR$ demands a systematic shift in resources toward geriatric health. This includes:\n    *   **Secondary Prevention:** Population-wide screening programs for cancers (e.g., breast, colorectal), hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia to detect disease at earlier, more treatable stages.\n    *   **Tertiary Prevention:** Disease management programs to prevent complications and disability from established NCDs.\n    *   **Specialized Geriatric Prevention:** Programs for fall prevention, osteoporosis screening and management, promotion of cognitive health, and adult vaccinations (e.g., influenza, pneumococcus, zoster).\n\nAt a systems level, this demographic reality requires a health system that can balance pediatric and geriatric expertise, reorient from acute, episodic care towards chronic disease management, and allocate public health resources equitably between the needs of the young and the old. The calculated ratios provide the quantitative justification for this balanced strategic direction.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0.3476  0.3120  0.6595 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4582985"}, {"introduction": "As a country progresses through the demographic transition, its population ages, which can create counter-intuitive statistical trends.

The concepts of crude death rate, age-specific mortality rates, and age standardization are standard measures in population health. The scenario described—falling age-specific mortality concurrent with population aging and a rising crude death rate—is a classic, well-documented phenomenon known as Simpson's paradox in mortality statistics, which occurs during the later stages of the demographic transition. The provided data values are consistent and plausible. For both years, the sum of population shares is $1$ (Year $1$: $0.30 + 0.60 + 0.10 = 1.00$; Year $2$: $0.18 + 0.58 + 0.24 = 1.00$). The age-specific mortality rates decrease from Year $1$ to Year $2$ in every stratum, consistent with \"survival improves\". The population structure shifts significantly towards the older age group (share $\\geq 65$ increases from $0.10$ to $0.24$), consistent with \"populations age\".\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data and clear definitions to perform the required calculations and answer the question. The question asks for a single best option, and the underlying calculations lead to a unique set of results.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, quantitative terms without subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. The solution process may proceed.\n\n**Derivation and Analysis**\n\n**Principle-Based Derivation**\nThe crude death rate ($CDR$) for a given year $t$ is the weighted average of the age-specific mortality rates ($M_{t,i}$), where the weights are the population proportions ($w_{t,i}$) for each age stratum $i$ in that year. The formula is:\n$$CDR_t = \\sum_{i} w_{t,i} \\cdot M_{t,i}$$\nThe direct age-standardized death rate ($ASDR$) for a given year $t$, using a standard population $S$, is calculated by applying the age-specific mortality rates of year $t$ ($M_{t,i}$) to the age structure of the standard population ($w_{S,i}$). The formula is:\n$$ASDR_t(S) = \\sum_{i} w_{S,i} \\cdot M_{t,i}$$\n\n**Task 1: Compute Crude Death Rates ($CDR$)**\n\nFor Year $1$, the $CDR_1$ is:\n$$CDR_1 = w_{1,1}M_{1,1} + w_{1,2}M_{1,2} + w_{1,3}M_{1,3}$$\n$$CDR_1 = (0.30 \\times 2) + (0.60 \\times 5) + (0.10 \\times 40)$$\n$$CDR_1 = 0.6 + 3.0 + 4.0 = 7.6$$\nThe crude death rate in Year $1$ is $7.6$ per $1000$ population.\n\nFor Year $2$, the $CDR_2$ is:\n$$CDR_2 = w_{2,1}M_{2,1} + w_{2,2}M_{2,2} + w_{2,3}M_{2,3}$$\n$$CDR_2 = (0.18 \\times 1.5) + (0.58 \\times 4) + (0.24 \\times 35)$$\n$$CDR_2 = 0.27 + 2.32 + 8.40 = 10.99$$\nThe crude death rate in Year $2$ is $10.99$ per $1000$ population.\n\nThe calculation shows that the crude death rate increased from $7.6$ to $10.99$ per $1000$, despite the fact that every age-specific mortality rate decreased ($M_{2,i}  M_{1,i}$ for all $i$).\n\n**Task 2: Compute Direct Age-Standardized Death Rate ($ASDR$) for Year $2$**\n\nUsing Year $1$ as the standard population ($S=1$), the $ASDR$ for Year $2$ is:\n$$ASDR_2(S=1) = w_{1,1}M_{2,1} + w_{1,2}M_{2,2} + w_{1,3}M_{2,3}$$\n$$ASDR_2(S=1) = (0.30 \\times 1.5) + (0.60 \\times 4) + (0.10 \\times 35)$$\n$$ASDR_2(S=1) = 0.45 + 2.40 + 3.50 = 6.35$$\nThe age-standardized death rate for Year $2$ is $6.35$ per $1000$.\n\nTo interpret this, we compare it to the corresponding rate for Year $1$. The standardized rate for Year $1$ using its own population structure as the standard is simply its crude rate, $ASDR_1(S=1) = CDR_1 = 7.6$.\nComparing the standardized rates, we find that $ASDR_2(S=1) = 6.35$ is lower than $ASDR_1(S=1) = 7.6$. This indicates that if the population's age structure had remained the same as in Year $1$, the overall mortality rate would have decreased, reflecting the genuine improvements in age-specific survival. The rise in the crude rate is therefore an artifact of the changing age distribution, specifically the \"compositional aging\" where a larger fraction of the population is in the high-mortality older age groups.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. The crude death rate can rise because of compositional aging: a larger share of older adults (with intrinsically higher mortality) increases the weight on higher age-specific risks enough to more than offset within-age improvements. Under direct standardization to Year $1$, the Year $2$ age-standardized death rate is lower than Year $1$, confirming genuine mortality improvement despite the crude rate rising.\n**Verdict: Correct.** The first sentence accurately describes the mechanism of Simpson's paradox in this context: the population share of the $\\geq 65$ age group increased from $0.10$ to $0.24$, increasing the weight on the highest mortality rates. The second sentence is also correct, as confirmed by our calculations: the $ASDR$ for Year $2$ ($6.35$) is indeed lower than the rate for Year $1$ ($7.6$).\n\nB. The crude death rate rose because at least one age-specific mortality rate increased; direct standardization would therefore show a higher Year $2$ rate than Year $1$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.** The premise is factually contradicted by the data. Every age-specific mortality rate decreased from Year $1$ to Year $2$: $M_{2,1}  M_{1,1}$ ($1.52$), $M_{2,2}  M_{1,2}$ ($45$), and $M_{2,3}  M_{1,3}$ ($3540$).\n\nC. A rise in the crude death rate is impossible if every age-specific rate falls; any observed increase must be a measurement error, and standardization will reproduce the same crude trend.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.** The calculations demonstrate that it is entirely possible for the crude rate to rise while all age-specific rates fall. This is a real demographic phenomenon, not a measurement error. Standardization is designed explicitly to remove the confounding effect of age structure, so it does not \"reproduce the same crude trend\"; in this case, it reverses it.\n\nD. The rise in the crude death rate must be due to net migration, so age standardization cannot alter the direction of the crude trend; the standardized rate will equal the crude rate in Year $2$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.** The population aging is a core feature of the demographic transition itself (due to falling fertility and rising longevity), not necessarily migration. More importantly, the claim that standardization \"cannot alter the direction of the crude trend\" is false; that is its primary purpose. The calculations show the crude trend is an increase ($7.6 \\to 10.99$) while the standardized trend is a decrease ($7.6 \\to 6.35$). The claim that the standardized rate equals the crude rate in Year $2$ is also false ($6.35 \\neq 10.99$).\n\nE. The crude death rate only rises when total population shrinks; therefore, with a stable or growing population, standardization will match the crude increase and indicate population-wide worsening.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.** The crude death rate is a rate, not an absolute number; its change is independent of the direction of change in total population size. A population can be growing rapidly but also aging, leading to a higher $CDR$.

The definition of the \"momentum factor M\" is specific to this problem but is clearly stated and serves a valid pedagogical purpose.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires the calculation of the Crude Birth Rate (CBR), Crude Death Rate (CDR), and rate of natural increase ($\\text{NI} = \\text{CBR}-\\text{CDR}$) for a given population structure under two different sets of vital rates, corresponding to Stage $2$ and Stage $4$ of the Demographic Transition Model (DTM). Finally, a momentum factor $M$ is computed as the ratio of the natural increase in Stage $2$ to that in Stage $4$.\n\nThe total population is $N = 100{,}000$.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of females in each reproductive age group, which is given as one-half of the total population in that group.\n- Females aged $15$–$19$: $F_{15-19} = 0.5 \\times 8{,}000 = 4{,}000$\n- Females aged $20$–$24$: $F_{20-24} = 0.5 \\times 8{,}500 = 4{,}250$\n- Females aged $25$–$29$: $F_{25-29} = 0.5 \\times 7{,}500 = 3{,}750$\n- Females aged $30$–$34$: $F_{30-34} = 0.5 \\times 7{,}000 = 3{,}500$\n- Females aged $35$–$39$: $F_{35-39} = 0.5 \\times 6{,}500 = 3{,}250$\n- Females aged $40$–$44$: $F_{40-44} = 0.5 \\times 6{,}000 = 3{,}000$\n- Females aged $45$–$49$: $F_{45-49} = 0.5 \\times 5{,}500 = 2{,}750$\n\n**Calculations for DTM Stage 2**\n\nThe total number of births in one year, $B_2$, is the sum of the products of the ASFRs and the number of females in each age group.\n$$ B_2 = \\sum_{i} \\text{ASFR}_{i,2} \\times F_i $$\n$$ B_2 = (0.08 \\times 4000) + (0.13 \\times 4250) + (0.12 \\times 3750) + (0.10 \\times 3500) + (0.07 \\times 3250) + (0.03 \\times 3000) + (0.005 \\times 2750) $$\n$$ B_2 = 320 + 552.5 + 450 + 350 + 227.5 + 90 + 13.75 = 2003.75 $$\nThe Crude Birth Rate for Stage $2$ is:\n$$ \\text{CBR}_2 = \\frac{B_2}{N} = \\frac{2003.75}{100000} = 0.0200375 $$\n\nThe total number of deaths in one year, $D_2$, is the sum of the products of the ASMRs and the number of persons in each age group.\n$$ D_2 = \\sum_{j} \\text{ASMR}_{j,2} \\times N_j $$\n$$ D_2 = (0.015 \\times 35000) + (0.006 \\times 8000) + (0.006 \\times 8500) + (0.007 \\times 7500) + (0.008 \\times 7000) + (0.010 \\times 6500) + (0.012 \\times 6000) + (0.015 \\times 5500) + (0.020 \\times 4800) + (0.030 \\times 4300) + (0.040 \\times 3700) + (0.060 \\times 3200) $$\n$$ D_2 = 525 + 48 + 51 + 52.5 + 56 + 65 + 72 + 82.5 + 96 + 129 + 148 + 192 = 1517 $$\nThe Crude Death Rate for Stage $2$ is:\n$$ \\text{CDR}_2 = \\frac{D_2}{N} = \\frac{1517}{100000} = 0.01517 $$\n\nThe natural increase for Stage $2$ is:\n$$ \\text{NI}_2 = \\text{CBR}_2 - \\text{CDR}_2 = 0.0200375 - 0.01517 = 0.0048675 $$\n\n**Calculations for DTM Stage 4**\n\nThe total number of births, $B_4$, is calculated using Stage $4$ ASFRs with the same population structure.\n$$ B_4 = \\sum_{i} \\text{ASFR}_{i,4} \\times F_i $$\n$$ B_4 = (0.02 \\times 4000) + (0.06 \\times 4250) + (0.07 \\times 3750) + (0.06 \\times 3500) + (0.04 \\times 3250) + (0.01 \\times 3000) + (0.001 \\times 2750) $$\n$$ B_4 = 80 + 255 + 262.5 + 210 + 130 + 30 + 2.75 = 970.25 $$\nThe Crude Birth Rate for Stage $4$ is:\n$$ \\text{CBR}_4 = \\frac{B_4}{N} = \\frac{970.25}{100000} = 0.0097025 $$\n\nThe total number of deaths, $D_4$, is calculated using Stage $4$ ASMRs with the same population structure.\n$$ D_4 = \\sum_{j} \\text{ASMR}_{j,4} \\times N_j $$\n$$ D_4 = (0.004 \\times 35000) + (0.002 \\times 8000) + (0.002 \\times 8500) + (0.003 \\times 7500) + (0.003 \\times 7000) + (0.004 \\times 6500) + (0.005 \\times 6000) + (0.007 \\times 5500) + (0.010 \\times 4800) + (0.015 \\times 4300) + (0.020 \\times 3700) + (0.030 \\times 3200) $$\n$$ D_4 = 140 + 16 + 17 + 22.5 + 21 + 26 + 30 + 38.5 + 48 + 64.5 + 74 + 96 = 593.5 $$\nThe Crude Death Rate for Stage $4$ is:\n$$ \\text{CDR}_4 = \\frac{D_4}{N} = \\frac{593.5}{100000} = 0.005935 $$\n\nThe natural increase for Stage $4$ is:\n$$ \\text{NI}_4 = \\text{CBR}_4 - \\text{CDR}_4 = 0.0097025 - 0.005935 = 0.0037675 $$\n\n**Momentum Factor and Interpretation**\n\nThe momentum factor $M$ is the ratio of the two rates of natural increase.\n$$ M = \\frac{\\text{NI}_2}{\\text{NI}_4} = \\frac{0.0048675}{0.0037675} \\approx 1.29199867 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $M = 1.292$.\n\nInterpretation:\n- **Sign**: The sign of $M$ is positive because the natural increase is positive in both scenarios ($\\text{NI}_2  0$ and $\\text{NI}_4  0$), indicating that this population would grow under either set of rates.\n- **Magnitude**: The magnitude $M \\approx 1.292$ indicates that the annual rate of natural increase for this specific young population structure is about $29.2\\%$ higher under Stage $2$ vital rates than it would be under Stage $4$ vital rates.\n- **Population Momentum**: The key insight related to population momentum is that $\\text{NI}_4$ is substantially positive ($\\text{NI}_4 = 0.0037675$). This means that even if this country immediately adopted the low birth and death rates of a Stage $4$ society, its population would continue to grow. This is because the young age structure, a legacy of past high fertility, contains a large proportion of people in the low-mortality age groups and a large cohort of women in their childbearing years. The resulting CDR is very low, and births still outnumber deaths. This \"built-in\" tendency for a young population to continue growing for several generations, even after fertility rates fall, is the essence of population momentum. The factor $M$ quantifies the relative strength of the growth impulse under the initial (Stage $2$) versus the replacement-level (Stage $4$) conditions for this fixed age structure.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.292}\n$$", "id": "4643460"}]}
