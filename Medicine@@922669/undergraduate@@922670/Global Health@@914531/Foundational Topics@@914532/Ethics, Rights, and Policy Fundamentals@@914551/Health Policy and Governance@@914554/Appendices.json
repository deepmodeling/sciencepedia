This is a constant value.\n- Number of deaths attributable to the disease, $N = 100$.\n- Remaining standard life expectancy at average age of death, $\\text{LE} = 20$ years.\n- The required output is a row vector in the order $[\\text{YLD}, \\text{YLL}, \\text{DALY}]$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed for its scientific soundness, well-posedness, and objectivity.\n\n1.  **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is grounded in the established principles of public health and epidemiology. DALY, YLD, and YLL are standard, well-defined metrics used globally for quantifying the burden of disease. The formulas for their calculation are part of the GBD framework, a major international scientific collaboration. The values provided are numerically plausible and do not violate any physical or biological principles.\n\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary quantitative data ($I$, $L$, $\\text{DW}$, $N$, $\\text{LE}$) and a clear set of definitions to compute the three requested quantities. The instruction to use the \"standard undiscounted and un-age-weighted approach\" removes potential ambiguities related to more complex calculation methods (e.g., age-weighting or discounting future years), ensuring a unique solution exists. The data provided (incident cases and duration of illness) unambiguously points towards an incidence-based calculation of YLD, which is a standard method.\n\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in clear, precise, and objective language, using standard terminology from the field of global health. There are no subjective claims or opinions.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the enumerated flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or ill-posed. It is a straightforward application of core public health formulas.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be constructed.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to calculate the Years Lived with Disability (YLD), the Years of Life Lost (YLL), and the total Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) for a specified condition. The DALY is a measure of overall disease burden, expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability, or early death.\n\nThe problem states that the total DALY is the sum of YLD and YLL.\n$$\n\\text{DALY} = \\text{YLD} + \\text{YLL}\n$$\nWe will calculate YLD and YLL separately and then sum them to find the total DALY. The problem specifies an undiscounted and un-age-weighted approach.\n\n**1. Calculation of Years Lived with Disability (YLD)**\n\nThe YLD represents the burden due to the morbidity of the condition. It is calculated based on the number of new cases (incidence), the average duration of the disability, and the severity of the disability (disability weight). The formula for an incidence-based calculation is:\n$$\n\\text{YLD} = I \\times \\text{DW} \\times L\n$$\nwhere:\n- $I$ is the number of incident cases in the period, given as $I = 500$.\n- $\\text{DW}$ is the disability weight, a value between $0$ (perfect health) and $1$ (death), given as $\\text{DW} = 0.3$.\n- $L$ is the average duration of the disability in years, given as $L = 2$ years.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$\n\\text{YLD} = 500 \\times 0.3 \\times 2\n$$\n$$\n\\text{YLD} = 150 \\times 2\n$$\n$$\n\\text{YLD} = 300 \\text{ years}\n$$\nThis represents $300$ years of healthy life lost to disability from the cases that began in the specified year.\n\n**2. Calculation of Years of Life Lost (YLL)**\n\nThe YLL represents the burden due to premature mortality from the condition. It is calculated by multiplying the number of deaths by the standard life expectancy at the age at which death occurs. The formula is:\n$$\n\\text{YLL} = N \\times \\text{LE}\n$$\nwhere:\n- $N$ is the number of deaths due to the condition in the period, given as $N = 100$.\n- $\\text{LE}$ is the remaining standard life expectancy in years at the age of death, given as $\\text{LE} = 20$ years.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$\n\\text{YLL} = 100 \\times 20\n$$\n$$\n\\text{YLL} = 2000 \\text{ years}\n$$\nThis represents $2000$ years of life lost due to premature death.\n\n**3. Calculation of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY)**\n\nThe total DALY is the sum of the YLD and YLL.\n$$\n\\text{DALY} = \\text{YLD} + \\text{YLL}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\n\\text{DALY} = 300 + 2000\n$$\n$$\n\\text{DALY} = 2300 \\text{ years}\n$$\nThe total burden of the disease for the cohort of individuals affected in that year is $2300$ Disability-Adjusted Life Years.\n\nThe final answer is required as a row vector ordered as $[\\text{YLD}, \\text{YLL}, \\text{DALY}]$.\nThe calculated values are:\n- $\\text{YLD} = 300$\n- $\\text{YLL} = 2000$\n- $\\text{DALY} = 2300$\n\nThe resulting vector is $[300, 2000, 2300]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n300  2000  2300\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4982400"}, {"introduction": "With limited resources, health policymakers must choose interventions that provide the most health for the money.

The cost-effectiveness threshold, representing the opportunity cost of health expenditure, is denoted by $\\lambda$.\n\nThe givens are:\nIncremental cost, $\\Delta C = 1000$ dollars.\nIncremental health effect, $\\Delta E = 0.05$ Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs).\nCost-effectiveness threshold, $\\lambda = 20000$ dollars per QALY.\n\nFirst, we derive the expressions that determine the adoption of the intervention.\n\nThe Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) is defined as the additional cost per unit of additional health effect gained. Mathematically, it is the ratio of the incremental cost to the incremental effect:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E}\n$$\nThe decision rule based on the ICER is to adopt the intervention if its cost per QALY gained is less than or equal to the maximum amount the health system is willing to pay for a QALY, which is the threshold $\\lambda$.

Therefore, the intervention is deemed cost-effective and should be adopted if:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} \\le \\lambda \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} \\le \\lambda\n$$\n\nAn alternative, but equivalent, decision framework is the Net Monetary Benefit (NMB). The NMB translates the health effects into monetary terms using the threshold $\\lambda$ as the valuation of a unit of health effect. The NMB is the value of the health gain minus the incremental cost. The expression for NMB is:\n$$\n\\text{NMB} = (\\lambda \\times \\Delta E) - \\Delta C\n$$\nThe decision rule in this framework is to adopt the intervention if it results in a non-negative net monetary benefit, which signifies that the monetized value of the health gain is at least as large as its cost. The condition for adoption is:\n$$\n\\text{NMB} \\ge 0\n$$\n\nWe can demonstrate the equivalence of these two decision rules. Starting with the NMB criterion for adoption, $\\text{NMB} \\ge 0$:\n$$\n(\\lambda \\times \\Delta E) - \\Delta C \\ge 0\n$$\nAdding $\\Delta C$ to both sides of the inequality gives:\n$$\n\\lambda \\times \\Delta E \\ge \\Delta C\n$$\nSince the health effect $\\Delta E = 0.05$ is a positive quantity, we can divide both sides of the inequality by $\\Delta E$ without changing the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$\n\\lambda \\ge \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E}\n$$\nRecognizing that the right-hand side is the definition of the ICER, we have:\n$$\n\\lambda \\ge \\text{ICER} \\quad \\text{or equivalently} \\quad \\text{ICER} \\le \\lambda\n$$\nThis confirms that the two decision rules, $\\text{NMB} \\ge 0$ and $\\text{ICER} \\le \\lambda$, are mathematically equivalent.\n\nNext, we compute the ICER and NMB for the given intervention.\n\nCalculation of the ICER:\nUsing the given values $\\Delta C = 1000$ and $\\Delta E = 0.05$:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{1000}{0.05} = \\frac{1000}{1/20} = 1000 \\times 20 = 20000\n$$\nThe units are dollars per QALY.
