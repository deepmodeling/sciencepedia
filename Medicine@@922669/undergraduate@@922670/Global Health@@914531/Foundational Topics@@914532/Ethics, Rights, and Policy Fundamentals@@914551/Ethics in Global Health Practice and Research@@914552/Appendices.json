This practice problem [@problem_id:4976573] simulates such a high-stakes scenario, challenging you to apply a clear ethical rule using a prognostic scoring system to see how abstract principles are translated into concrete, life-and-death decisions.", "problem": "A regional hospital faces a public health emergency in which invasive mechanical ventilation is the binding resource. There are $5$ ventilators available and $8$ adult patients who each require one ventilator to have a chance at survival. The institution has adopted a triage policy grounded in the widely used public health ethics principle to save the most lives, operationalized as prioritizing patients with higher likelihood of short-term survival to hospital discharge. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores are used as an ordinal prognostic tool, with lower scores indicating better expected short-term survival. When two or more patients have indistinguishable priority (equal $SOFA$ scores) and resource scarcity forces a choice among them, the policy mandates a fair lottery among equals.\n\nThe $SOFA$ scores of the $8$ patients are $6$, $8$, $10$, $12$, $14$, $16$, $6$, and $9$.\n\nStarting only from (i) the ethical principle to save the most lives, (ii) the monotonic interpretation that lower $SOFA$ corresponds to better short-term survival prospects, and (iii) the tie-breaking rule of lottery among equals when necessary, determine which patients are prioritized for the $5$ ventilators, and then compute the arithmetic mean $m$ of the $SOFA$ scores among the ventilated patients. Provide the exact value of $m$ (no rounding).", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid. It is self-contained, scientifically grounded in established medical and ethical frameworks (use of SOFA scores for prognosis, triage principles), and algorithmically solvable. It presents a clear scenario of resource allocation under scarcity, governed by a defined set of rules.\n\nThe task is to determine the set of patients who will receive ventilators and then to compute the arithmetic mean of their Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores. The guiding ethical principle is to save the most lives, which is operationalized by prioritizing patients with a higher likelihood of short-term survival. The problem states that a lower SOFA score corresponds to a better prognosis. Therefore, the allocation priority is inversely related to the SOFA score; patients with lower scores are prioritized.\n\nThe number of available ventilators is $V = 5$.\nThe number of patients requiring a ventilator is $N = 8$.\nThe SOFA scores for the $N=8$ patients are given as the set $\\{6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 6, 9\\}$.\n\nTo implement the prioritization scheme, we must order the patients from highest priority to lowest priority. This corresponds to sorting their SOFA scores in non-decreasing (ascending) order.\nThe sorted list of scores is:\n$$ \\langle 6, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16 \\rangle $$\n\nWe have $V=5$ ventilators to distribute to the patients at the top of this priority list. The allocation proceeds as follows:\n1.  The first two positions in the sorted list are occupied by patients with a SOFA score of $6$. These are the highest-priority patients. The problem specifies a tie-breaking rule: a lottery is used \"when two or more patients have indistinguishable priority... and resource scarcity forces a choice among them\". At this stage, we have $5$ ventilators and $2$ patients with the highest priority. Since the number of available resources ($5$) is greater than the size of the tied group ($2$), there is no scarcity forcing a choice *between* them. Thus, both patients are allocated a ventilator. After this step, $5 - 2 = 3$ ventilators remain.\n2.  The next patient in the priority list has a SOFA score of $8$. This patient is allocated the third ventilator. $3 - 1 = 2$ ventilators remain.\n3.  The next patient has a SOFA score of $9$. This patient is allocated the fourth ventilator. $2 - 1 = 1$ ventilator remains.\n4.  The next patient has a SOFA score of $10$. This patient is allocated the fifth and final ventilator. $1 - 1 = 0$ ventilators remain.\n\nThe allocation process is now complete. The $V=5$ ventilators have been assigned to the $5$ patients with the lowest SOFA scores. The set of scores for the ventilated patients, denoted as $S_{v}$, is:\n$$ S_{v} = \\{6, 6, 8, 9, 10\\} $$\nThe remaining patients, with scores of $\\{12, 14, 16\\}$, do not receive ventilators.\n\nThe final step is to compute the arithmetic mean, $m$, of the SOFA scores of the ventilated patients. The mean is the sum of the values divided by the count of the values.\nThe sum of the scores is:\n$$ \\sum_{s \\in S_{v}} s = 6 + 6 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 39 $$\nThe number of ventilated patients is $n_v = 5$.\nThe arithmetic mean $m$ is:\n$$ m = \\frac{1}{n_v} \\sum_{s \\in S_{v}} s = \\frac{39}{5} $$\nAs an exact value, this fraction is equivalent to the decimal $7.8$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.8}$$", "id": "4976573"}, {"introduction": "Beyond immediate crises, global health leaders must constantly decide how to allocate limited budgets across numerous potential health programs.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of health economics, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its language. The problem is a straightforward application of the definition of a quality-adjusted life year (QALY).\n\nThe core definition of a QALY provided is the time integral of the instantaneous utility function, $U(t)$, over a specific time interval. The objective is to compute the total incremental QALYs for a cohort of patients. An incremental QALY represents the gain in QALYs due to an intervention compared to a baseline or comparator (in this case, usual care).\n\nFirst, let us define the variables and functions based on the problem statement:\n- The time horizon for the analysis is $T = 2$ years. The integration interval will be from $t_1 = 0$ to $t_2 = 2$.\n- The utility function under usual care is constant: $U_{\\text{uc}}(t) = 0.5$.\n- The utility function with the intervention is constant: $U_{\\text{int}}(t) = 0.8$.\n- The number of patients in the cohort is $N = 1,000$.\n\nThe incremental QALYs gained for a single person, denoted as $\\Delta Q_{\\text{person}}$, is the difference between the QALYs accumulated with the intervention ($\\text{QALY}_{\\text{int}}$) and the QALYs that would have been accumulated under usual care ($\\text{QALY}_{\\text{uc}}$) over the specified time horizon.\n\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\Delta Q_{\\text{person}} = \\text{QALY}_{\\text{int}} - \\text{QALY}_{\\text{uc}} = \\int_{0}^{T} U_{\\text{int}}(t) \\,dt - \\int_{0}^{T} U_{\\text{uc}}(t) \\,dt\n$$\n\nUsing the property of linearity of integrals, we can combine this into a single integral of the difference in utility functions.

A cornerstone of ethical research is the principle of respect for persons, which mandates that participants provide voluntary and truly informed consent.

This practice problem [@problem_id:4976599] demonstrates how we can use quantitative reasoning not just to measure health outcomes, but to evaluate and improve our ethical procedures. By modeling the impact of a specific technique like the \"teach-back\" method, you will quantify how a thoughtfully designed process can better uphold the rights and autonomy of research participants.", "problem": "A global health research team is designing an informed consent process for a study with $n=500$ adult participants in a low-resource setting. By the ethical principle of respect for persons, informed consent requires comprehension, voluntariness, and adequate disclosure of information. Assume that voluntariness and disclosure requirements are fully satisfied for all participants, so that a consent is valid if and only if the participant comprehends the information presented. The team considers two consent processes: a teach-back method, in which the probability of comprehension for any given participant is $p=0.85$, and a standard process without teach-back, in which the probability of comprehension is $p=0.60$. Model each participant’s comprehension outcome as an independent Bernoulli trial.\n\nStarting from the definition of expectation and the linearity of expectation applied to the sum of independent Bernoulli random variables, derive the expected number of valid consents under each process and then compute the net increase in the expected number of valid consents when using teach-back rather than the standard process among $n=500$ participants. Express the final result as a single integer count with no units. No rounding is required beyond exact arithmetic.", "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in probability theory and research ethics, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation. The problem asks for a derivation based on fundamental principles, which will be provided.\n\nLet us model the comprehension outcome for each of the $n$ participants as an independent Bernoulli trial. For the $i$-th participant, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$, we define a random variable $X_i$ such that:\n$$\nX_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n1  \\text{if the participant comprehends (valid consent)} \\\\\n0  \\text{if the participant does not comprehend (invalid consent)}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe probability of comprehension, which corresponds to a \"success\" in the Bernoulli trial, is denoted by $p$. Therefore, the probability mass function for $X_i$ is $P(X_i=1) = p$ and $P(X_i=0) = 1-p$.\n\nThe problem explicitly requires deriving the expected value starting from the definition of expectation. The expected value of a discrete random variable is the sum of the product of each possible value and its probability. For a single Bernoulli random variable $X_i$, the expectation $E[X_i]$ is:\n$$\nE[X_i] = \\sum_{k \\in \\{0,1\\}} k \\cdot P(X_i=k) = (0 \\cdot P(X_i=0)) + (1 \\cdot P(X_i=1))\n$$\nSubstituting the probabilities, we get:\n$$\nE[X_i] = (0 \\cdot (1-p)) + (1 \\cdot p) = p\n$$\nThis shows that the expected value of a single Bernoulli trial is equal to its success probability $p$.\n\nThe total number of valid consents, denoted by $N_{valid}$, is the sum of the outcomes for all $n$ participants. Since each $X_i$ represents the outcome for one participant, the total number is:\n$$\nN_{valid} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\n$$\nThis variable $N_{valid}$ follows a binomial distribution, $N_{valid} \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n,p)$. The problem requires us to find the expected number of valid consents, $E[N_{valid}]$, using the linearity of expectation. The linearity property states that the expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expectations. Applying this to $N_{valid}$:\n$$\nE[N_{valid}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_i]\n$$\nSince the participants' comprehension outcomes are independent and identically distributed, each $X_i$ has the same expectation $E[X_i] = p$. Therefore:\n$$\nE[N_{valid}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p = n \\cdot p\n$$\nThis formula gives the expected number of valid consents for a group of $n$ participants where each has a probability $p$ of comprehension.\n\nNow, we apply this derived formula to the two processes described in the problem. The total number of participants is $n=500$.\n\nFor the standard process, the probability of comprehension is $p_{Std} = 0.60$. Let $N_{Std}$ be the number of valid consents under this process. The expected number of valid consents is:\n$$\nE[N_{Std}] = n \\cdot p_{Std} = 500 \\cdot 0.60 = 300\n$$\n\nFor the teach-back method, the probability of comprehension is $p_{TB} = 0.85$. Let $N_{TB}$ be the number of valid consents under this process. The expected number of valid consents is:\n$$\nE[N_{TB}] = n \\cdot p_{TB} = 500 \\cdot 0.85 = 425\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the net increase in the expected number of valid consents when using the teach-back method instead of the standard process. This is the difference between the two expectations:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E[N_{TB}] - E[N_{Std}]\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\n\\Delta E = 425 - 300 = 125\n$$\nAlternatively, we can compute this symbolically first:\n$$\n\\Delta E = n \\cdot p_{TB} - n \\cdot p_{Std} = n (p_{TB} - p_{Std})\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Delta E = 500 (0.85 - 0.60) = 500 (0.25) = 125\n$$\nThe net increase in the expected number of valid consents is $125$.
