A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to calculate the probability that at least one infected traveler arrives in the city on a given day. Let this event be denoted by $A$.\n\nA direct calculation of $P(A)$ would involve summing the probabilities of exactly one infected traveler arriving, exactly two, and so on, up to the total number of travelers. This is computationally intensive. A more efficient method is to use the complement rule. The complement of event $A$, denoted $A^c$, is the event that *no* infected travelers arrive on a given day. The probability of event $A$ is then given by:\n$$P(A) = 1 - P(A^c)$$\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of travelers arriving in the city per day. Let $N_{flights}$ be the number of flights and $n$ be the number of passengers per flight. The total number of travelers, $N_{total}$, is:\n$$N_{total} = N_{flights} \\times n = 50 \\times 150 = 7500$$\n\nThe problem states that the infection prevalence among travelers is $p = 0.002$. This is the probability that any single traveler is infected. Consequently, the probability that a single traveler is *not* infected is $1 - p$.\n$$1 - p = 1 - 0.002 = 0.998$$\n\nThe event $A^c$ (no infected travelers arrive) occurs if and only if all $N_{total}$ travelers are not infected. The problem specifies that each passenger's infection status is an independent Bernoulli outcome. Due to this independence, the probability that all $N_{total}$ travelers are not infected is the product of their individual probabilities of not being infected:\n$$P(A^c) = (1 - p)^{N_{total}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(A^c) = (0.998)^{7500}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability of event $A$, that at least one infected traveler arrives:\n$$P(A) = 1 - P(A^c) = 1 - (0.998)^{7500}$$\n\nTo obtain the numerical value, we evaluate the expression.\nFirst, we compute $(0.998)^{7500}$:\n$$(0.998)^{7500} \\approx 3.0140715 \\times 10^{-7}$$\nThen, we subtract this value from $1$:\n$$P(A) \\approx 1 - 3.0140715 \\times 10^{-7} = 0.99999969859285...$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to seven significant figures. The first significant figure is the first non-zero digit, which is the first $9$. We count seven digits from there.\nThe value is $0.99999969859...$\nThe first seven significant figures are $9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6$. The eighth significant figure is $9$. Since $9 \\ge 5$, we must round up the seventh significant figure (the $6$).\nRounding $6$ up gives $7$.\nThus, the rounded probability is $0.9999997$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9999997}$$", "id": "4980283"}, {"introduction": "Beyond infectious diseases, the economic interconnectedness of globalization can generate negative health externalities, such as transboundary air pollution from industrial activities.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the number of excess deaths starting from the definition of a log-linear concentration-response relationship. Let $M(C)$ be the mortality rate as a function of the annual-average $\\text{PM}_{2.5}$ concentration, $C$. The log-linear model states that the natural logarithm of the mortality rate is a linear function of concentration:\n$$\n\\ln(M(C)) = \\alpha + \\beta C\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a constant related to the baseline mortality rate in the absence of the pollutant and $\\beta$ is the concentration-response coefficient, representing the change in the log-rate of mortality per unit increase in concentration.\n\nThis relationship can be expressed in exponential form:\n$$\nM(C) = \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta C) = \\exp(\\alpha) \\exp(\\beta C)\n$$\nLet $M_0 = M(C_{base})$ be the baseline mortality rate at a baseline concentration $C_{base}$. We can set a reference concentration frame such that $C_{base}=0$ without loss of generality, so $M_0 = \\exp(\\alpha)$. The model then becomes:\n$$\nM(C) = M_0 \\exp(\\beta C)\n$$\nThe relative risk ($RR$) for an increase in concentration from a baseline level $C_0$ to a new level $C_0 + \\Delta C$ is the ratio of the new mortality rate to the baseline mortality rate:\n$$\nRR(\\Delta C) = \\frac{M(C_0 + \\Delta C)}{M(C_0)} = \\frac{M_0 \\exp(\\beta (C_0 + \\Delta C))}{M_0 \\exp(\\beta C_0)} = \\frac{\\exp(\\beta C_0) \\exp(\\beta \\Delta C)}{\\exp(\\beta C_0)} = \\exp(\\beta \\Delta C)\n$$\nThe problem states that mortality risk increases by $6\\%$ (i.e., $p=0.06$) for a $\\Delta C_{ref} = 10~\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{m}^3$ increase in $\\text{PM}_{2.5}$. A $6\\%$ increase corresponds to a relative risk of $1 + 0.06 = 1.06$. We use this information to determine the coefficient $\\beta$:\n$$\nRR(10) = 1.06 = \\exp(\\beta \\cdot 10~\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{m}^3)\n$$\nSolving for $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\ln(1.06) = 10 \\beta \\implies \\beta = \\frac{\\ln(1.06)}{10~\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{m}^3}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the specific relative risk for the pollution increment given in the problem, which is $\\Delta C = 5~\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{m}^3$:\n$$\nRR_{actual} = \\exp(\\beta \\cdot \\Delta C) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\ln(1.06)}{10} \\cdot 5\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(1.06)\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\ln(1.06^{1/2})\\right) = \\sqrt{1.06}\n$$\nThe number of excess deaths, $\\Delta D$, is the difference between the number of deaths in the polluted scenario ($D_{new}$) and the number of deaths in the baseline scenario ($D_0$). The number of deaths is the mortality rate multiplied by the population size, $P$.\n\nThe baseline mortality rate per person is given as $800$ per $100,000$ population.\n$$\nM_0 = \\frac{800}{100,000} = 0.008\\ \\text{deaths per person per year}\n$$\nThe number of baseline deaths is:\n$$\nD_0 = M_0 \\times P\n$$\nThe new mortality rate, $M_{new}$, is the baseline rate multiplied by the relative risk:\n$$\nM_{new} = M_0 \\times RR_{actual}\n$$\nThe new number of deaths is:\n$$\nD_{new} = M_{new} \\times P = (M_0 \\times RR_{actual}) \\times P\n$$\nThe number of excess deaths, $\\Delta D$, is then:\n$$\n\\Delta D = D_{new} - D_0 = (M_0 \\times RR_{actual} \\times P) - (M_0 \\times P) = P \\times M_0 \\times (RR_{actual} - 1)\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the annual number of excess deaths.
