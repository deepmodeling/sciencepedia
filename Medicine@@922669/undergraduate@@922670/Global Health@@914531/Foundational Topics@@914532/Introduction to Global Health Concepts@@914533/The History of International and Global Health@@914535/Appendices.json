For historical comparability, treat the time lived with disability as a constant flow over the episode duration and treat the years of life lost as the remaining standard life expectancy at the age of death.\n\nTasks:\n1. Using only fundamental definitions of time lost due to premature mortality and time lived with disability, compute the total annual burden in year $t$ measured in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) under the base-case assumptions.\n2. Perform a one-way sensitivity analysis on the two non-fatal parameters $w$ and $d$ by varying each by $\\pm 20\\%$ independently (holding all else constant), and compute the corresponding annual Years Lived with Disability (YLD) and total DALYs for each variation.\n3. Finally, consider a joint sensitivity scenario designed to mimic methodological changes debated in the 1990s: apply a continuous annual discount rate of $r = 0.03$ to both the morbidity duration and the years of life lost, increase both $w$ and $d$ by $15\\%$, and decrease the number of deaths by $5\\%$.

It quantifies the additional cost required to gain one additional unit of health outcome. Here, Program E is both more costly ($C_{E}  C_{P}$) and more effective ($D_{E}  D_{P}$) than Program P, so an ICER calculation is appropriate. Program P serves as the comparator or baseline.\n    The formula for the ICER of Program E relative to Program P is:\n    $$\n    \\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta D} = \\frac{C_{E} - C_{P}}{D_{E} - D_{P}}\n    $$\n    First, we calculate the incremental cost, $\\Delta C$:\n    $$\n    \\Delta C = C_{E} - C_{P} = (178 \\times 10^{6}) - (90 \\times 10^{6}) = 88 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ USD}\n    $$\n    Next, we calculate the incremental effectiveness, $\\Delta D$:\n    $$\n    \\Delta D = D_{E} - D_{P} = (1.22 \\times 10^{6}) - (0.90 \\times 10^{6}) = 0.32 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ DALYs}\n    $$\n    Now, we compute the ICER:\n    $$\n    \\text{ICER} = \\frac{88 \\times 10^{6}}{0.32 \\times 10^{6}} = \\frac{88}{0.32} = 275 \\text{ USD per DALY}\n    $$\n    This means that choosing Program E over Program P results in an additional cost of $275$ for each additional DALY averted.\n\n3.  **Indifference Threshold ($\\lambda$) from Net Monetary Benefit (NMB)**\n    The Net Monetary Benefit (NMB) framework translates health outcomes (DALYs) into monetary terms using a willingness-to-pay threshold, $\\lambda$. The NMB of a program is calculated as:\n    $$\n    \\text{NMB} = (\\lambda \\times \\text{DALYs averted}) - \\text{Cost}\n    $$\n    A decision-maker is indifferent between two programs when their NMBs are equal.

Consider a conceptual model grounded in the following foundational elements: the definition of the basic reproduction number $R_0$ as the expected number of secondary infections generated by a typical infectious individual in a fully susceptible population in the absence of intervention; the operational premise that indoor residual spraying reduces the vector’s survival or effective biting success by a constant proportional factor $e$ in treated dwellings; and the well-tested modeling fact that, under homogeneous mixing and independence of exposures, the effective reproduction number $R_{\\text{eff}}$ equals $R_0$ multiplied by the average fraction of transmission potential remaining after intervention across all exposure strata.\n\nAssume that a malaria program achieves household coverage $c$, meaning a fraction $c$ of dwellings are sprayed, while a fraction $1 - c$ are not. Suppose exposures relevant to transmission (vector resting and human-vector contact) are distributed uniformly across dwellings, and the reduction in transmission potential due to spraying is multiplicative and equal to the factor $1 - e$ in sprayed dwellings, with no reduction in unsprayed dwellings. Under these premises, the program aims to interrupt transmission, which is equivalent to achieving $R_{\\text{eff}}  1$.\n\nStarting only from the above fundamental definition of $R_0$, the independence and homogeneous mixing assumption for aggregating transmission across sprayed and unsprayed strata, and the operational efficacy descriptor $e$, derive the coverage threshold $c_{\\text{crit}}$ (as a closed-form expression in $R_0$ and $e$) for which $R_{\\text{eff}} = 1$.

Sprayed dwellings, comprising a fraction $c$ of the total.\n2.  Unsprayed dwellings, comprising the remaining fraction $1 - c$.\n\nThe problem states that in sprayed dwellings, the intervention reduces the vector's survival or biting success such that the remaining transmission potential is a fraction $1 - e$ of what it would be without spraying. The efficacy parameter $e$ is a value between $0$ and $1$, where $e=0$ implies no effect and $e=1$ implies perfect efficacy (zero transmission potential).\n\nIn unsprayed dwellings, there is no intervention, so the transmission potential is unreduced. This corresponds to a remaining fraction of $1$.\n\nThe problem specifies that \"exposures relevant to transmission ... are distributed uniformly across dwellings.\" This assumption of homogeneous mixing implies that the average fraction of transmission potential remaining across the entire population of dwellings is the weighted average of the fractions remaining in each stratum, with the weights being the proportions of dwellings in each stratum.\n\nLet $F$ be the average fraction of transmission potential remaining.
