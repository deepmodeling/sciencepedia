It constitutes a standard single-zone indoor air quality model.\n\nThe derivation begins with the principle of conservation of mass for the pollutant within the control volume of the room. Let $C(t)$ be the indoor pollutant concentration in units of mass per volume (e.g., $\\mu\\text{g} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-3}$), and let $V$ be the fixed volume of the room (e.g., $\\text{m}^3$). The total mass of the pollutant in the room at time $t$ is $M(t) = C(t)V$.\n\nThe rate of change of mass in the control volume is equal to the sum of all mass rates entering the volume minus the sum of all mass rates leaving the volume.\n$$ \\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = \\sum (\\text{Rate of Mass In}) - \\sum (\\text{Rate of Mass Out}) $$\nSince the volume $V$ is constant, the left-hand side of the equation can be written as:\n$$ \\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d(C(t)V)}{dt} = V \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} $$\nNext, we formulate the mass rate terms for each process described:\n\n$1$. **Indoor Source**: The source is characterized by an effective concentration-generation rate $S$, with units of mass per volume per time. This rate is defined as $S = E/V$, where $E$ is the mass emission rate. Therefore, the rate of mass generation within the volume is $E = SV$.\n\n$2$. **Air Exchange (Ventilation)**: The air exchange rate is $a$ (units of $\\text{time}^{-1}$). The volumetric flow rate of air into and out of the room is $Q = aV$.\n    - **Influx**: Air enters with an outdoor concentration $C_{\\text{out}}$. The mass rate of pollutant entering the room via ventilation is $Q \\cdot C_{\\text{out}} = aVC_{\\text{out}}$.\n    - **Efflux**: The room is assumed to be well-mixed, so the air leaving the room has the same concentration as the air inside, $C(t)$. The mass rate of pollutant leaving the room via ventilation is $Q \\cdot C(t) = aVC(t)$.\n\n$3$. **First-Order Losses**: Indoor losses (e.g., deposition, chemical reaction) occur at a first-order rate $k$ (units of $\\text{time}^{-1}$). The rate of mass removal is proportional to the total mass $M(t)$ present in the room. The mass removal rate is thus $kM(t) = kC(t)V$.\n\nCombining these terms into the mass balance equation:\n$$ V \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = (\\text{Source}) + (\\text{Ventilation In}) - (\\text{Ventilation Out}) - (\\text{Losses}) $$\n$$ V \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = SV + aVC_{\\text{out}} - aVC(t) - kC(t)V $$\nTo obtain the ordinary differential equation for $C(t)$, we divide the entire equation by the non-zero, constant volume $V$:\n$$ \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = S + aC_{\\text{out}} - aC(t) - kC(t) $$\nBy grouping the terms containing $C(t)$, we arrive at the desired ODE:\n$$ \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = (S + aC_{\\text{out}}) - (a+k)C(t) $$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation.\n\nTo find the steady-state concentration, denoted by $C^{\\ast}$, we consider the condition where the concentration is no longer changing with time, i.e., $\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0$.

The problem states that $D$ is the time-averaged amount of contaminant ingested per unit body weight per day.
