It is scientifically grounded in established principles of epidemiology, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is presented in an objective, formalizable manner. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to first derive an expression for the population-attributable fraction ($PAF$) in terms of the relative risk ($RR$) and the exposure prevalence ($P_e$), and then to calculate its numerical value using the provided data.\n\nThe initial definitions given are:\n1. Population-Attributable Fraction: $PAF = \\frac{I_{p} - I_{u}}{I_{p}}$, where $I_{p}$ is the population incidence and $I_{u}$ is the incidence in the unexposed population.\n2. Relative Risk: $RR = \\frac{I_{e}}{I_{u}}$, where $I_{e}$ is the incidence in the exposed population.\n3. Population Incidence: $I_{p} = P_{e}I_{e} + (1 - P_{e})I_{u}$, where $P_{e}$ is the prevalence of exposure in the population.\n\nWe begin the derivation with the formula for $PAF$:\n$$PAF = \\frac{I_{p} - I_{u}}{I_{p}}$$\nSubstitute the expression for population incidence, $I_{p}$, into the numerator:\n$$PAF = \\frac{(P_{e}I_{e} + (1 - P_{e})I_{u}) - I_{u}}{I_{p}}$$\nSimplify the numerator:\n$$PAF = \\frac{P_{e}I_{e} + I_{u} - P_{e}I_{u} - I_{u}}{I_{p}}$$\n$$PAF = \\frac{P_{e}I_{e} - P_{e}I_{u}}{I_{p}}$$\n$$PAF = \\frac{P_{e}(I_{e} - I_{u})}{I_{p}}$$\nNow substitute the expression for $I_p$ into the denominator as well:\n$$PAF = \\frac{P_{e}(I_{e} - I_{u})}{P_{e}I_{e} + (1 - P_{e})I_{u}}$$\nTo express this equation in terms of $RR$ and $P_e$, we can eliminate the incidence rates $I_e$ and $I_u$. We achieve this by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by $I_u$. This is a valid operation assuming $I_u > 0$, which must be the case for a non-trivial problem where the disease exists in the unexposed population.\n$$PAF = \\frac{\\frac{P_{e}(I_{e} - I_{u})}{I_{u}}}{\\frac{P_{e}I_{e} + (1 - P_{e})I_{u}}{I_{u}}}$$\nDistribute the division in both the numerator and denominator:\n$$PAF = \\frac{P_{e}\\left(\\frac{I_{e}}{I_{u}} - \\frac{I_{u}}{I_{u}}\\right)}{P_{e}\\frac{I_{e}}{I_{u}} + (1 - P_{e})\\frac{I_{u}}{I_{u}}}$$\nBy definition, $\\frac{I_{e}}{I_{u}} = RR$ and $\\frac{I_{u}}{I_{u}} = 1$. Substituting these into the equation yields the desired expression for $PAF$ in terms of $RR$ and $P_e$:\n$$PAF = \\frac{P_{e}(RR - 1)}{P_{e}RR + (1 - P_{e})}$$\nThis formula can also be written by rearranging the denominator:\n$$P_{e}RR + 1 - P_{e} = 1 + P_{e}RR - P_{e} = 1 + P_{e}(RR - 1)$$\nThus, an equivalent and commonly cited form of the expression is:\n$$PAF = \\frac{P_{e}(RR - 1)}{1 + P_{e}(RR - 1)}$$\nThis completes the derivation part of the problem.\n\nNext, we must compute the numerical value of $PAF$ for the district. The problem provides the following values:\nRelative Risk, $RR = 2.0$\nExposure Prevalence, $P_{e} = 0.4$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$PAF = \\frac{0.4(2.0 - 1)}{1 + 0.4(2.0 - 1)}$$\nFirst, calculate the term $(RR - 1)$:\n$$2.0 - 1 = 1.0$$\nNow substitute this back into the equation:\n$$PAF = \\frac{0.4(1.0)}{1 + 0.4(1.0)}$$\n$$PAF = \\frac{0.4}{1 + 0.4}$$\n$$PAF = \\frac{0.4}{1.4}$$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $10$:\n$$PAF = \\frac{4}{14} = \\frac{2}{7}$$\nTo obtain the final decimal value, we perform the division:\n$$PAF = \\frac{2}{7} \\approx 0.28571428...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $2$, $8$, $5$, and $7$. The fifth significant digit is $1$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (truncate).\n$$PAF \\approx 0.2857$$\nThis value means that approximately $28.57\\%$ of the diarrheal disease cases in the district are attributable to the exposure to unsafe drinking water and could be prevented if this exposure were eliminated.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2857}$$", "id": "4996857"}, {"introduction": "Economic policies are a key lever for influencing health behaviors, but how can we predict their impact? This practice problem uses the concept of price elasticity of demand, a cornerstone of microeconomics, to forecast how a price subsidy on fruit might increase consumption [@problem_id:4996603]. This skill is essential for designing evidence-based health policies that are both effective and efficient, moving from identifying problems to creating tangible solutions.", "problem": "A public health agency in a low-income urban district is considering a fruit price subsidy as part of a diet improvement initiative. The baseline mean fruit consumption is $250$ grams per person per day. The subsidy is expected to reduce the retail price of fresh fruit by a proportional amount of $0.20$ relative to the baseline price. Empirical evidence for this population suggests a constant point own-price elasticity of demand for fruit around the baseline equal to $-0.5$. Starting from the core definition of price elasticity of demand as the proportional responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in price, use an appropriate first-order approximation consistent with small proportional changes to derive the expected absolute increase in average fruit consumption attributable to the subsidy. Express the final result in grams per person per day and round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the expected absolute increase in average fruit consumption resulting from a price subsidy. This requires applying the definition of price elasticity of demand to the given parameters. The solution will be derived by first establishing the formal relationship between price, quantity, and elasticity, and then using a first-order approximation to calculate the change in quantity consumed.\n\nThe point own-price elasticity of demand, $E_d$, is defined as the proportional change in quantity demanded, $Q$, for an infinitesimal proportional change in price, $P$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$E_d = \\frac{dQ/Q}{dP/P} = \\frac{P}{Q} \\frac{dQ}{dP}$$\n\nThe problem states that we should use a first-order approximation for small proportional changes. For a small, finite change in price, $\\Delta P$, the corresponding change in quantity, $\\Delta Q$, can be approximated using the point elasticity at the initial state $(P_0, Q_0)$. The definition can be rewritten for finite, small changes as:\n$$E_d \\approx \\frac{\\Delta Q / Q_0}{\\Delta P / P_0}$$\nwhere $Q_0$ is the baseline consumption, and $\\Delta P / P_0$ is the proportional change in price. This approximation is equivalent to a first-order Taylor expansion of the demand function $Q(P)$ around the point $P_0$.\n\nWe are tasked with finding the absolute increase in fruit consumption, which is the quantity $\\Delta Q$. We can rearrange the approximate elasticity formula to solve for $\\Delta Q$:\n$$\\Delta Q \\approx Q_0 \\cdot E_d \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\Delta P}{P_0}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we extract the given values from the problem statement:\nThe baseline mean fruit consumption is $Q_0 = 250$ grams per person per day.\nThe constant point own-price elasticity of demand is $E_d = -0.5$.\nThe subsidy reduces the retail price by a proportional amount of $0.20$. A price reduction corresponds to a negative change in price. Therefore, the proportional change in price is:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta P}{P_0} = -0.20$$\n\nSubstituting these values into the rearranged formula for $\\Delta Q$:\n$$\\Delta Q \\approx (250) \\cdot (-0.5) \\cdot (-0.20)$$\n\nWe can now perform the calculation:\n$$\\Delta Q \\approx 250 \\cdot ((-0.5) \\cdot (-0.20))$$\n$$\\Delta Q \\approx 250 \\cdot (0.10)$$\n$$\\Delta Q \\approx 25$$\n\nThe result, $\\Delta Q \\approx 25$, is positive, which correctly represents an increase in consumption as expected from a price reduction (subsidy). The units are the same as $Q_0$, which are grams per person per day.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $25$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $25.00$.\n\nThus, the expected absolute increase in average fruit consumption is $25.00$ grams per person per day.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{25.00}$$", "id": "4996603"}, {"introduction": "A central goal in addressing social determinants is to reduce health inequality, but first, we must be able to measure it.

It ranges from $-1$ to $+1$.\n- A value of $C > 0$ indicates that the health outcome is disproportionately concentrated among the richer individuals. This is often termed a \"pro-rich\" distribution.\n- A value of $C < 0$ indicates that the health outcome is disproportionately concentrated among the poorer individuals. This is often termed a \"pro-poor\" distribution.\n- A value of $C = 0$ indicates that there is no socioeconomic-related inequality; the health outcome is, on average, equally distributed across all socioeconomic groups.\n\nIn this problem, the calculated value is $C = \\frac{1}{3}$. Since $C$ is a positive number, it signifies that the health outcome (represented by $y=1$) is more concentrated among the individuals with higher socioeconomic rank, i.e., the richer individuals.
