The data provided for each patient profile are internally consistent and represent common clinical scenarios.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis requires applying the standard definitions for physiological lung patterns based on PFT results.\n\n**Guiding Principles:**\n\n1.  **Obstructive Ventilatory Defect:** Primarily defined by a reduction in the ratio of Forced Expiratory Volume in $1$ second ($FEV_1$) to Forced Vital Capacity ($FVC$). A common threshold is $FEV_1/FVC  0.70$ or below the lower limit of normal (LLN). Obstructive diseases can lead to air trapping (increased Residual Volume, $RV$) and hyperinflation (increased Total Lung Capacity, $TLC$).\n2.  **Restrictive Ventilatory Defect:** Defined by a reduced Total Lung Capacity ($TLC$), typically below $80\\%$ of the predicted value or below the $5$th percentile. In restriction, $FEV_1$ and $FVC$ are often reduced proportionally, leading to a normal or elevated $FEV_1/FVC$ ratio.\n3.  **Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Restriction:** This distinction is aided by the $DLCO$.\n    *   **Intrinsic (Parenchymal) Restriction:** Involves the lung tissue itself (e.g., interstitial fibrosis). This impairs gas exchange, resulting in a reduced $DLCO$.\n    *   **Extrinsic Restriction:** Caused by issues outside the lung parenchyma (e.g., chest wall disease, neuromuscular weakness). Gas exchange at the alveolar-capillary membrane is typically preserved, so the $DLCO$ is normal.\n4.  **Technique-Related Artifacts:** Poor spirometric effort, particularly early termination of the forced exhalation, can artificially lower the $FVC$. This can mimic a restrictive pattern on spirometry alone (low $FVC$ with a normal $FEV_1/FVC$ ratio). Measurement of $TLC$ and assessment of quality control indicators are essential to differentiate this from true restriction. A forced expiratory time (FET) of less than $6$ seconds is a key indicator of potential early termination.\n\n**Patient-by-Patient Analysis:**\n\n**Patient Z:**\n- The spirometry values ($FEV_1 = 48\\%$, $FVC = 49\\%$) with a high $FEV_1/FVC$ ratio ($0.98$) suggest a restrictive pattern.\n- However, the quality control data are critical: \"suboptimal; forced expiratory time $= 3$ seconds, early termination noted, poor reproducibility.\" An FET of $3$ seconds is insufficient and indicates the patient did not exhale fully. This invalidates the $FVC$ measurement.\n- The definitive measurement for restriction, the $TLC$, is normal ($98\\%$ predicted). A normal $TLC$ rules out a restrictive ventilatory defect.\n- **Conclusion:** Patient Z does not have restrictive lung disease. The spirometry pattern is a technique-related artifact due to suboptimal effort.\n\n**Patient Y:**\n- The spirometry values ($FEV_1 = 50\\%$, $FVC = 52\\%$) with a high $FEV_1/FVC$ ratio ($0.86$) might initially suggest restriction.\n- However, the lung volume measurements show a markedly elevated $TLC$ of $120\\%$ predicted and a severely elevated $RV$ of $190\\%$ predicted.\n- An elevated $TLC$ indicates hyperinflation, and an elevated $RV$ indicates air trapping. These are hallmark features of obstructive lung disease, not restrictive disease. The low $FVC$ in this context is likely due to dynamic airway collapse and air trapping during forced exhalation.\n- The normal $DLCO$ ($82\\%$ predicted) suggests the obstructive process does not significantly involve destruction of the alveolar-capillary bed (as seen in emphysema) and might be more consistent with a disease like chronic asthma.\n- **Conclusion:** Patient Y has a pattern consistent with obstructive lung disease with significant hyperinflation and air trapping, not restrictive lung disease.\n\n**Patient X:**\n- The spirometry shows a proportional reduction in $FEV_1$ ($55\\%$ predicted) and $FVC$ ($59\\%$ predicted), with a high $FEV_1/FVC$ ratio ($0.93$). This is the classic spirometric picture of restriction.\n- The spirometry quality is good (FET $= 10$ seconds), so the measurements are valid.\n- The lung volume measurement confirms the restrictive defect: the $TLC$ is significantly reduced to $66\\%$ of predicted. This is the definitive finding for restriction.\n- The $DLCO$ is also significantly reduced ($52\\%$ predicted). A reduction in both $TLC$ and $DLCO$ indicates that the restriction is due to a disease process within the lung parenchyma that also affects the alveolar-capillary membrane's ability to transfer gas.\n- **Conclusion:** The combination of a confirmed restrictive defect (low $TLC$) and impaired gas exchange (low $DLCO$) makes Patient X the classic example of **intrinsic (parenchymal) restrictive lung disease**.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Patient $X$ shows intrinsic restrictive lung disease due to parenchymal involvement.**\n- This option aligns perfectly with our analysis. Patient X has a reduced $TLC$ ($66\\%$), confirming restriction. The associated low $DLCO$ ($52\\%$) indicates a parenchymal (intrinsic) cause.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Patient $Y$ shows intrinsic restrictive lung disease.**\n- This option is incorrect. Patient Y has an elevated $TLC$ ($120\\%$), which indicates hyperinflation, the opposite of restriction. The pattern is consistent with obstructive disease.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Patient $Z$ shows intrinsic restrictive lung disease.**\n- This option is incorrect. Patient Z has a normal $TLC$ ($98\\%$), which rules out a restrictive defect. The spirometric abnormalities are artifacts of a poor-quality test.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. None of the above; all patterns are obstructive or technique-related, not intrinsic restriction.**\n- This option is incorrect because our analysis has clearly identified that Patient X's pattern is most consistent with intrinsic restrictive lung disease.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4970326"}, {"introduction": "To effectively address chronic respiratory diseases on a global scale, we must move beyond individual diagnoses and quantify their collective impact on populations.

Calculation of YLD per $100{,}000$ persons**\n\nThe problem provides the parameters for an incidence-based calculation of $YLD$. The total $YLD$ is the product of the number of new (incident) cases, the disability weight of the condition, and the average duration of the disability. We are asked to find this value per $100{,}000$ persons, which we denote as $YLD_{100k}$.\n\nThe incidence rate, $I$, is given as the number of new cases per $100{,}000$ persons per year. For a representative population of $100{,}000$ persons, there will be $I$ new cases in the year. Each of these cases contributes an average of $DW \\times L_{\\text{dur}}$ years of disability over the course of the illness.\n\nThus, the total years lived with disability per $100{,}000$ people is the product of the number of incident cases per $100{,}000$ and the disability years per case:\n$$YLD_{100k} = I \\times DW \\times L_{\\text{dur}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n- $I = 120$ cases per $100{,}000$ persons\n- $DW = 0.17$\n- $L_{\\text{dur}} = 20$ years\n\n$$YLD_{100k} = 120 \\times 0.17 \\times 20$$\n$$YLD_{100k} = 120 \\times 3.4$$\n$$YLD_{100k} = 408$$\nThe units are years per $100{,}000$ persons.\n\n**2. Calculation of YLL per $100{,}000$ persons**\n\n$YLL$ is the sum of years of life lost due to premature mortality. To calculate $YLL$ per $100{,}000$ persons ($YLL_{100k}$), we first need the mortality rate per $100{,}000$ persons, which we denote as $M_{100k}$.\n\nThe mortality rate per $100{,}000$ is calculated from the total number of deaths, $N$, and the total population, $P$:\n$$M_{100k} = \\frac{N}{P} \\times 100{,}000$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n- $N = 30{,}000$ deaths\n- $P = 40{,}000{,}000$ persons\n\n$$M_{100k} = \\frac{30{,}000}{40{,}000{,}000} \\times 100{,}000 = \\frac{3}{4{,}000} \\times 100{,}000 = \\frac{300}{4} = 75$$\nSo, there are $75$ deaths per $100{,}000$ persons.\n\nThe $YLL$ per $100{,}000$ persons is the mortality rate per $100{,}000$ multiplied by the average years of life lost per death, $L_{\\text{rem}}$:\n$$YLL_{100k} = M_{100k} \\times L_{\\text{rem}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated $M_{100k}$ and the given $L_{\\text{rem}}$:\n- $M_{100k} = 75$ deaths per $100{,}000$ persons\n- $L_{\\text{rem}} = 12$ years\n\n$$YLL_{100k} = 75 \\times 12$$\n$$YLL_{100k} = 900$$\nThe units are years per $100{,}000$ persons.\n\n**3.
