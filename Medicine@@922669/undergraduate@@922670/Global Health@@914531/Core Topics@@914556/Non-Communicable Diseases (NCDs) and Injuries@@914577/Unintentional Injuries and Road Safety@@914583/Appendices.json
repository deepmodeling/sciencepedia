It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. Therefore, a full solution is provided.\n\nThe four tasks specified in the problem statement are addressed in sequence.\n\n1. Definition of dual-source capture–recapture:\nDual-source capture–recapture is a statistical method used in epidemiological surveillance to estimate the size of a population that is difficult to enumerate completely. In the context of road traffic injuries, the unknown target population of size $N$ is the true total number of unique injury-sustaining crashes occurring within a defined time and geographic area. The method utilizes two independent and incomplete lists (sources) that identify cases from this population. In this problem, list $1$ is from police crash reports, capturing $n_1$ unique crashes, and list $2$ is from emergency hospital admissions, capturing $n_2$ unique crashes. By linking the records between the two lists, the number of crashes captured by both sources, $m_2$, is determined. The size of this overlap, relative to the sizes of the individual lists, allows for an estimation of the number of crashes missed by both sources, and thus an estimation of the total population size $N$.\n\n2. Derivation of the estimator:\nThe derivation begins from first principles under the assumption of a closed population over the one-month observation window. Let $N$ be the total unknown number of unique crashes. Let $p_1$ be the probability that a random crash from the population is captured by the police list (source $1$), and let $p_2$ be the probability that it is captured by the hospital list (source $2$). The number of crashes observed in each list, $n_1$ and $n_2$, can be modeled as binomial random variables with expected values:\n$$E[n_1] = Np_1$$\n$$E[n_2] = Np_2$$\nThe crucial assumption is the independence of the two sources. This means that the event of a crash being recorded by the police is statistically independent of it being recorded by a hospital. Under this assumption, the probability of a crash being captured by both sources is the product of the individual capture probabilities, $p_1 p_2$. The expected number of crashes found in both lists, $m_2$, is therefore:\n$$E[m_2] = N p_1 p_2$$\nFrom these expected values, we can find estimators for the probabilities. An estimate for $p_1$ can be formed by considering the proportion of crashes from the hospital list ($n_2$) that were also \"recaptured\" by the police list ($m_2$). This gives $\\hat{p}_1 = \\frac{m_2}{n_2}$. We can also write an estimate for $N$ using the first list: $\\hat{N} = \\frac{n_1}{\\hat{p}_1}$. Substituting the expression for $\\hat{p}_1$ yields the estimator:\n$$\\hat{N} = \\frac{n_1}{\\left(\\frac{m_2}{n_2}\\right)} = \\frac{n_1 n_2}{m_2}$$\nThis is the Lincoln-Petersen estimator, which is the maximum likelihood estimator for $N$. However, this estimator is known to be biased, particularly for small values of the overlap, $m_2$. A small-sample, bias-reduced correction was proposed by Chapman. The Chapman estimator is given by:\n$$\\hat{N}_C = \\frac{(n_1 + 1)(n_2 + 1)}{m_2 + 1} - 1$$\nThis estimator is justified because it is exactly unbiased when $n_1 + n_2 \\ge N$ and approximately unbiased otherwise. It arises from considering the hypergeometric distribution of $m_2$ conditional on $n_1$, $n_2$, and $N$. The term $\\frac{m_2+1}{(n_1+1)(n_2+1)}$ is an unbiased estimator of $\\frac{1}{N+1}$. The Chapman estimator generally has a smaller mean squared error than the Lincoln-Petersen estimator, making it preferable in practice, especially when the problem framing suggests a concern for sparse overlaps.\n\n3. Calculation of the point estimate:\nThe problem provides the following data: $n_1 = 600$, $n_2 = 800$, and $m_2 = 300$. We use the bias-reduced Chapman estimator derived above to compute the point estimate for $N$.\n$$\\hat{N}_C = \\frac{(n_1 + 1)(n_2 + 1)}{m_2 + 1} - 1$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\hat{N}_C = \\frac{(600 + 1)(800 + 1)}{300 + 1} - 1$$\n$$\\hat{N}_C = \\frac{(601)(801)}{301} - 1$$\n$$\\hat{N}_C = \\frac{481401}{301} - 1$$\n$$\\hat{N}_C \\approx 1599.33887 - 1$$\n$$\\hat{N}_C \\approx 1598.33887$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final estimate to four significant figures. Rounding $1598.33887$ to four significant figures gives $1598$.\n\n4. Key assumptions for validity:\nThe validity of the capture-recapture estimate $\\hat{N}_C$ depends on several key assumptions. In the context of road traffic injury surveillance, these are:\na. **Closed Population**: The total population of crashes $N$ is constant during the one-month surveillance period. No crashes are added or removed from the population in a way that affects their detection probabilities. This is a reasonable assumption for a short, fixed period.\nb. **Independence of Sources**: The probability of a crash appearing in the police database is independent of its probability of appearing in the hospital database. This is a strong assumption and is often violated. For example, more severe crashes are more likely to be reported to both police and hospitals, introducing a positive correlation (positive dependence bias) which would lead to an underestimation of $N$.\nc. **Homogeneous Capture Probabilities**: Every crash in the population has the same probability of being recorded by a given source. That is, $p_1$ is constant for all crashes, and $p_2$ is constant for all crashes. This is also frequently violated, as factors like crash severity, location (urban vs. rural), and time of day can influence the probability of being recorded.\nd. **Perfect Matching**: It is possible to link records from the two lists without error. This means every crash that appears in both lists is correctly identified as a match, and no false matches are made. In practice, data quality issues, such as missing names or incorrect dates, can make perfect matching difficult.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1598}$$", "id": "5007326"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply counting fatalities, it is crucial to measure the full impact of premature death from road traffic injuries. This practice focuses on calculating Years of Life Lost (YLL), a core metric in global health that quantifies the burden of deaths occurring at younger ages [@problem_id:5007305]. You will not only compute this value but also explore its sensitivity to underlying assumptions, a critical skill for interpreting and reporting on the burden of disease.", "problem": "A national trauma registry in a middle-income country reports that over one calendar year there were $500$ road-traffic fatalities among young adult motorcyclists. The median age at death was $25$ years. The country’s burden-of-disease analysts adopt a standard life table consistent with the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) framework, in which the standard remaining life expectancy at age $25$ is $55$ years. Using only the foundational definition that years of life lost (YLL) equals the sum, over all deaths, of the standard remaining life expectancy at the ages at which those deaths occur, and adopting the simplifying assumption that all decedents were age $25$, compute the YLL attributable to these road-traffic fatalities.

Do not include this derivation in your final numeric answer; it is for reasoning only.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to road-traffic fatalities among a specific population cohort and an analysis of the sensitivity of this calculation to changes in the standard life expectancy.\n\nFirst, the primary calculation of YLL will be performed. The foundational definition of YLL, as stated in the problem, is the sum of the standard remaining life expectancy for each death. Let $N$ be the total number of deaths, and let $L_i$ be the standard remaining life expectancy at the age of death for the $i$-th individual. The total YLL is given by the sum:\n$$YLL = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} L_i$$\n\nThe problem provides the following data:\nThe total number of fatalities, $N = 500$.\nThe problem introduces a simplifying assumption that all deaths occurred at the same age, which is given as $a = 25$ years. This replaces the distribution of ages at death with a single point estimate.\nThe standard remaining life expectancy at age $a=25$ years is given as $L_{25} = 55$ years.\n\nUnder the simplifying assumption that all $N$ deaths occur at the age of $25$, the standard remaining life expectancy for each of the $N$ individuals is the same, i.e., $L_i = L_{25}$ for all $i=1, \\dots, N$. The summation for YLL simplifies to a product:\n$$YLL = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} L_{25} = N \\times L_{25}$$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values into this expression:\n$$N = 500$$\n$$L_{25} = 55$$\nThe total YLL is:\n$$YLL = 500 \\times 55 = 27500 \\text{ years}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact value is $27500$. To express this unambiguously with four significant figures, we use scientific notation: $2.750 \\times 10^4$.\n\nNext, the problem asks for a symbolic derivation of the change in YLL, denoted as $\\Delta YLL$, if the standard remaining life expectancy at age $25$ were to change by an increment $\\Delta L$.\n\nLet the original standard remaining life expectancy at age $25$ be $L_{25}$. The original YLL, which we can call $YLL_{orig}$, is:\n$$YLL_{orig} = N \\times L_{25}$$\nNow, let the standard remaining life expectancy at age $25$ change by an amount $\\Delta L$. The new life expectancy, $L'_{25}$, is:\n$$L'_{25} = L_{25} + \\Delta L$$\nThe new total YLL, denoted $YLL_{new}$, will be:\n$$YLL_{new} = N \\times L'_{25} = N \\times (L_{25} + \\Delta L)$$\nThe change in YLL, $\\Delta YLL$, is the difference between the new and original YLL values:\n$$\\Delta YLL = YLL_{new} - YLL_{orig}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $YLL_{new}$ and $YLL_{orig}$:\n$$\\Delta YLL = N \\times (L_{25} + \\Delta L) - (N \\times L_{25})$$\nDistributing $N$ in the first term:\n$$\\Delta YLL = N \\times L_{25} + N \\times \\Delta L - N \\times L_{25}$$\nThe term $N \\times L_{25}$ cancels out, yielding the symbolic expression for the change in YLL:\n$$\\Delta YLL = N \\times \\Delta L$$\n\nFinally, we interpret this sensitivity.\nThe derived expression $\\Delta YLL = N \\times \\Delta L$ shows a direct linear relationship between the change in total YLL and the change in the standard remaining life expectancy at the age of death. The number of deaths, $N$, acts as a constant of proportionality.\n\nIn terms of direction, the sign of $\\Delta YLL$ is the same as the sign of $\\Delta L$. If the standard life expectancy estimate increases ($\\Delta L > 0$), the calculated YLL will also increase. Conversely, if the standard life expectancy estimate decreases ($\\Delta L  0$), the calculated YLL will decrease. This is logical, as a longer life expectancy at the age of death implies a greater number of years lost for each premature fatality.\n\nIn terms of proportional magnitude, we can examine the fractional change in YLL:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta YLL}{YLL_{orig}} = \\frac{N \\times \\Delta L}{N \\times L_{25}} = \\frac{\\Delta L}{L_{25}}$$\nThis result indicates that the fractional (or percentage) change in the total YLL is exactly equal to the fractional (or percentage) change in the standard remaining life expectancy at the age of death. For instance, a $10\\%$ increase in $L_{25}$ would lead to a $10\\%$ increase in the total YLL attributable to these deaths. This highlights the high sensitivity of YLL calculations to the choice of the standard life table, especially when dealing with a large number of deaths $N$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.750 \\times 10^{4}}$$", "id": "5007305"}, {"introduction": "Once the scale and burden of road injuries are understood, the next step is to identify effective targets for intervention.
