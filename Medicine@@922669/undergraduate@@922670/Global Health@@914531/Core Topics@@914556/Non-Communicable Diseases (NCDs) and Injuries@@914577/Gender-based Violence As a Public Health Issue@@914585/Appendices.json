By calculating and interpreting the $RR$ from a hypothetical cohort study, you will learn how to assess the strength of this association and understand the critical distinction between correlation and causation in public health research. [@problem_id:4978113]", "problem": "A public health cohort study is conducted to quantify the association between Gender-Based Violence (GBV) and incident depression in a low-resource urban setting, with the aim of informing global health policy. GBV is defined here as physical, sexual, or psychological harm perpetrated based on gender norms or power imbalances. At baseline, all participants are screened for prior GBV exposure, and incident depression is ascertained through standardized diagnostic interviews at $12$ months. Of the cohort, the fraction exposed to GBV at baseline is $0.4$. Over the $12$-month follow-up, the cumulative incidence of depression among those exposed to GBV is $0.12$, and among those unexposed is $0.06$. Using core epidemiologic definitions of cumulative incidence and comparative measures of association, compute the risk ratio (RR) comparing the exposed group to the unexposed group. Then, briefly interpret whether this measure by itself establishes causality, identifying key causal inference concerns that may arise in this observational setting.\n\nProvide your final numerical answer for the risk ratio as an exact value, with no rounding and no units.

The interpretive discussion does not require a numerical output.", "solution": "The epidemiologic target is to compare the occurrence of depression between those exposed to Gender-Based Violence (GBV) and those unexposed over a fixed period. The fundamental bases we use are:\n\n- The definition of cumulative incidence (risk): over a fixed period, cumulative incidence is the proportion of initially disease-free individuals who develop the disease in that period.\n- A comparative measure that quantifies association between exposure and outcome by comparing the risk in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group. The risk ratio (RR) is the measure that expresses this comparison as a ratio of risks.\n\nFrom the study description, the cumulative incidence of depression among those exposed to GBV over $12$ months is $0.12$, and the cumulative incidence among those unexposed is $0.06$. By the conceptual definition of the risk ratio as the ratio of the cumulative incidence in the exposed group to that in the unexposed group, the numerical value is computed by dividing the risk in the exposed by the risk in the unexposed.\n\nCompute the ratio:\n$$\nRR = \\frac{0.12}{0.06}.\n$$\n\nPerform the arithmetic:\n$$\n\\frac{0.12}{0.06} = \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-2}}{6 \\times 10^{-2}} = \\frac{12}{6} = 2.\n$$\n\nThus, the risk ratio is $2$, which indicates that, in this cohort over $12$ months, the risk of incident depression among those exposed to GBV is twice that of those unexposed.\n\nInterpretation and causality concerns: While $RR=2$ suggests a strong positive association between GBV exposure and incident depression, this measure alone does not establish causality in an observational cohort due to several core causal inference issues grounded in the counterfactual framework (the causal effect would compare the same population’s depression risk if, contrary to fact, everyone were exposed versus everyone were unexposed). Key concerns include:\n\n- Confounding: Factors associated with both GBV exposure and depression (for example, socioeconomic disadvantage, prior mental health vulnerability, substance use, or neighborhood violence) could create non-comparability between exposed and unexposed groups. Without adequate measurement and control, the observed $RR$ may be biased.\n- Selection bias: Differential loss to follow-up or differential enrollment related to both exposure and risk of depression can distort the association if those retained differ systematically from those lost.\n- Measurement error: Misclassification of GBV exposure (e.g., underreporting due to stigma) or outcome (diagnostic misclassification) can bias the $RR$, with the direction depending on whether errors are non-differential or differential.\n- Reverse causation and temporality: Although the cohort structure and $12$-month follow-up establish temporal order, any pre-existing depressive symptoms at baseline that influence both reporting of GBV or vulnerability to GBV could complicate interpretation if not excluded or adjusted.\n- Residual confounding and effect modification: Even after adjustment, unmeasured or imperfectly measured confounders may remain, and the association may vary across subgroups (e.g., by age or social support), leading to heterogeneity in $RR$.\n\nTherefore, while $RR=2$ is consistent with a potentially causal relationship, causal claims require careful assessment of these issues, ideally complemented by robust design features (e.g., prospective measurement, thorough confounder control, sensitivity analyses) to approximate the counterfactual contrast.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "4978113"}, {"introduction": "While a risk ratio quantifies the strength of association for individuals, policymakers must understand the broader impact on the population to set priorities.
