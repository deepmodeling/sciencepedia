The items are designed to be unidimensional and tau-equivalent, and they are standardized so that each item has variance $1$. Across the sample, the average inter-item correlation (the average of all off-diagonal item-item correlations) is $\\bar{r}=0.5$. The initiative intends to use the sum score to make decisions about resource allocation to community mobilization activities.\n\nStarting from core principles of Classical Test Theory, specifically the definition of reliability as the proportion of observed-score variance attributable to true-score variance, and using well-tested properties of variance for sums of correlated variables, derive an expression for the internal consistency reliability of the sum score (Cronbach’s alpha) in terms of $k$ and $\\bar{r}$ under the tau-equivalence and standardized-item assumptions.

Cronbach's alpha ($\\alpha$) can be derived from the variance of the total score and the variances of the individual items.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Observed-Score Variance, $\\sigma_Y^2$**\nThe variance of a sum of $k$ variables is the sum of their individual variances plus the sum of all their pairwise covariances.\n$$ \\sigma_Y^2 = \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^k X_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\text{Var}(X_i) + \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) $$\nThe problem states that all items are standardized, meaning the variance of each item is 1.\n$$ \\text{Var}(X_i) = \\sigma_{X_i}^2 = 1 \\quad \\text{for all } i=1, \\dots, k $$\nTherefore, the sum of the item variances is simply $k$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^k \\text{Var}(X_i) = k $$\nThe covariance between two items, $\\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j)$, is related to their correlation, $\\rho_{ij}$, by the formula $\\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) = \\rho_{ij} \\sigma_{X_i} \\sigma_{X_j}$. Since the items are standardized, their standard deviations are $\\sigma_{X_i} = \\sigma_{X_j} = 1$. Thus, the covariance is equal to the correlation: $\\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) = \\rho_{ij}$.\nThe problem provides the average inter-item correlation, $\\bar{r}$. There are $k(k-1)$ unique off-diagonal pairs of items. The sum of all covariances is the number of pairs multiplied by the average covariance, which equals the average correlation $\\bar{r}$.\n$$ \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) = k(k-1)\\bar{r} $$\nCombining these results, the total variance of the observed sum score is:\n$$ \\sigma_Y^2 = k + k(k-1)\\bar{r} $$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation and Calculation of Cronbach's Alpha**\nThe general formula for Cronbach's alpha is:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k}{k-1} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^k \\sigma_{X_i}^2}{\\sigma_Y^2} \\right) $$\nWe have already established that for standardized items, $\\sum_{i=1}^k \\sigma_{X_i}^2 = k$. Substituting this and the expression for $\\sigma_Y^2$ from Part 1 into the formula for alpha:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k}{k-1} \\left( 1 - \\frac{k}{k + k(k-1)\\bar{r}} \\right) $$\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator for the term in the parenthesis:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k}{k-1} \\left( \\frac{k + k(k-1)\\bar{r} - k}{k + k(k-1)\\bar{r}} \\right) $$\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k}{k-1} \\left( \\frac{k(k-1)\\bar{r}}{k(1 + (k-1)\\bar{r})} \\right) $$\nCanceling terms ($k$ and $k-1$) gives the standardized alpha formula:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k \\bar{r}}{1 + (k-1)\\bar{r}} $$\nThis is the required general expression for Cronbach's alpha under the given assumptions.\n\nNow we compute the numerical value using the provided data: $k=5$ and $\\bar{r}=0.5$.\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{5 \\times 0.5}{1 + (5-1) \\times 0.5} = \\frac{2.5}{1 + (4 \\times 0.5)} = \\frac{2.5}{1 + 2} = \\frac{2.5}{3} $$\nTo express this as an exact fraction, we write $2.5$ as $5/2$.\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{5/2}{3} = \\frac{5}{6} $$\n\n**Interpretation of the Result**\nA reliability coefficient of $\\alpha = 5/6$, which is approximately $0.833$, is generally considered to reflect good internal consistency. This value indicates that about $83.3\\%$ of the variance in the sum scores for community engagement is attributable to true differences between households, while the remaining $16.7\\%$ is due to random measurement error. For the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation at the community level, this level of reliability is quite adequate.
