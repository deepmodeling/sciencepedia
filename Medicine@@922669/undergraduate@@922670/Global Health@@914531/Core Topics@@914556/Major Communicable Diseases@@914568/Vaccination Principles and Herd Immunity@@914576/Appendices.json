It is a well-tested fact that at the start of an epidemic, when depletion of susceptibles by infection is negligible, the effective reproduction number satisfies $R_{\\mathrm{e}} = R_{0} S$.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The solution proceeds.\n\nThe first objective is to derive the minimal immune fraction, denoted $H^{*}$, required to prevent sustained transmission. The threshold for preventing sustained transmission is the point at which the effective reproduction number, $R_{\\mathrm{e}}$, is equal to $1$. At this threshold, each infectious individual produces, on average, one new infection, so the epidemic does not grow.\n\nWe are given the relation:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{e}} = R_{0} S$$\nWe are also given that the susceptible fraction $S$ is related to the immune fraction $H$ by:\n$$S = 1 - H$$\nSubstituting the expression for $S$ into the equation for $R_{\\mathrm{e}}$ yields:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{e}} = R_{0} (1 - H)$$\nTo find the herd immunity threshold $H^{*}$, we set $R_{\\mathrm{e}} = 1$:\n$$1 = R_{0} (1 - H^{*})$$\nWe now solve for $H^{*}$ as a function of $R_{0}$. This is under the assumption that $R_{0} > 1$, which is the necessary condition for an epidemic to be possible in the first place. If $R_{0} \\le 1$, no epidemic can occur even in a fully susceptible population, and the required immune fraction is $0$. Given the context and the value $R_{0} = 3.5$, the assumption $R_{0} > 1$ is valid.\n$$\\frac{1}{R_{0}} = 1 - H^{*}$$\n$$H^{*} = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_{0}}$$\nThis expression gives the minimal immune fraction needed to achieve herd immunity.\n\nThe second objective is to determine the sensitivity coefficient $c$ that relates the uncertainty in $H^{*}$ to the uncertainty in $R_{0}$. This is achieved using a first-order Taylor series approximation, also known as the delta method. For a function $H^{*}(R_{0})$, the uncertainty propagation is given by:\n$$\\sigma_{H^{*}} \\approx \\left| \\frac{dH^{*}}{dR_{0}} \\right| \\sigma_{R_{0}}$$\nThe problem defines the sensitivity coefficient $c$ as the factor in this approximation:\n$$c = \\left| \\frac{dH^{*}}{dR_{0}} \\right|$$\nWe must compute the derivative of $H^{*}(R_{0}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_{0}} = 1 - R_{0}^{-1}$ with respect to $R_{0}$:\n$$\\frac{dH^{*}}{dR_{0}} = \\frac{d}{dR_{0}} \\left( 1 - R_{0}^{-1} \\right) = 0 - (-1)R_{0}^{-2} = \\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}$$\nSince $R_{0}^{2}$ is always positive for $R_{0} > 1$, the derivative is positive, and the absolute value is redundant. Therefore, the sensitivity coefficient is:\n$$c = \\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}}$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate both $H^{*}$ and $c$ for the given value $R_{0} = 3.5$.\n\nFor the minimal immune fraction $H^{*}$:\n$$H^{*} = 1 - \\frac{1}{3.5} = 1 - \\frac{1}{7/2} = 1 - \\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{5}{7}$$\nThe problem requires this result as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\frac{5}{7} \\approx 0.7142857...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$H^{*} \\approx 0.7143$$\n\nFor the sensitivity coefficient $c$:\n$$c = \\frac{1}{R_{0}^{2}} = \\frac{1}{(3.5)^{2}}$$\nThe problem requires an exact expression for this value.\n$$(3.5)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{49}{4} = 12.25$$\nTherefore,\n$$c = \\frac{1}{49/4} = \\frac{4}{49}$$\n\nThe final answer is to be reported as a two-entry row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} H^{*} & c \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe two calculated values are $H^{*} \\approx 0.7143$ and $c = \\frac{4}{49}$.\nThe matrix is thus $\\begin{pmatrix} 0.7143 & \\frac{4}{49} \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.7143 & \\frac{4}{49} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2543678"}, {"introduction": "While the basic herd immunity threshold assumes perfect immunity, real-world vaccines are not 100% effective.

It is based on standard principles of mathematical epidemiology and provides all necessary information for a complete solution.\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested.\n\n**1. Derivation of the minimal vaccination coverage, $p_{\\min}$**\n\nThe analysis begins from the foundational principles provided.\nAn unvaccinated individual has a baseline susceptibility to infection, which we can normalize to $1$. The vaccine has an efficacy $E$ against susceptibility, meaning it reduces a vaccinated individual's susceptibility by a factor of $(1-E)$. Therefore, the relative susceptibility of a vaccinated individual is $(1-E)$.\n\nAccording to the third principle provided, in a homogeneously vaccinated population with a coverage fraction $p$, the average susceptibility of the population, denoted by $\\bar{s}$, is the coverage-weighted mean of the susceptibilities of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. A fraction $(1-p)$ of the population is unvaccinated (susceptibility of $1$), and a fraction $p$ is vaccinated (susceptibility of $1-E$).\n\nThe average susceptibility is therefore:\n$$ \\bar{s} = (1-p) \\cdot 1 + p \\cdot (1-E) $$\nSimplifying this expression:\n$$ \\bar{s} = 1 - p + p - pE = 1 - pE $$\n\nAccording to the first principle, the effective reproduction number, $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is the product of the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, and the average population susceptibility, $\\bar{s}$.\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{eff}} = R_0 \\cdot \\bar{s} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\bar{s}$:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{eff}} = R_0 (1 - pE) $$\n\nAccording to the second principle, sustained transmission is prevented when $R_{\\mathrm{eff}} < 1$. The critical threshold for achieving herd immunity is when $R_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1$. We can find the minimal vaccination coverage, $p_{\\min}$, by setting $p = p_{\\min}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1$.\n$$ 1 = R_0 (1 - p_{\\min}E) $$\n\nWe now solve for $p_{\\min}$ as a function of $R_0$ and $E$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{R_0} = 1 - p_{\\min}E $$\n$$ p_{\\min}E = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0} $$\n$$ p_{\\min}E = \\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0} $$\n$$ p_{\\min} = \\frac{R_0 - 1}{E R_0} $$\nThis is the required expression for the minimal homogeneous coverage $p_{\\min}$.\n\n**2. Evaluation of $p_{\\min}$ for the given parameters**\n\nWe are given $R_0 = 12$ and a vaccine efficacy of $E = 0.9$. Substituting these values into the derived expression for $p_{\\min}$:\n$$ p_{\\min} = \\frac{12 - 1}{(0.9) \\cdot 12} = \\frac{11}{10.8} $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ p_{\\min} \\approx 1.0185185... $$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we get:\n$$ p_{\\min} \\approx 1.019 $$\nSince $p_{\\min} > 1$, this result indicates that achieving herd immunity (i.e., reducing $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ to less than $1$) is impossible under these conditions, even with $100\\%$ vaccination coverage ($p=1$). With $p=1$, the effective reproduction number would be $R_{\\mathrm{eff}} = R_0(1 - E) = 12(1-0.9) = 12(0.1) = 1.2$. As $1.2 > 1$, transmission would still be sustained.

Calculation of the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial p_{\\min}}{\\partial E}$**\n\nTo assess the sensitivity of the required coverage to vaccine efficacy, we compute the partial derivative of $p_{\\min}$ with respect to $E$. Our starting expression is:\n$$ p_{\\min}(E) = \\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0 E} = \\left(\\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0}\\right) E^{-1} $$\nWe differentiate this expression with respect to $E$, treating $R_0$ as a constant:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p_{\\min}}{\\partial E} = \\left(\\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0}\\right) \\frac{d}{dE}(E^{-1}) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p_{\\min}}{\\partial E} = \\left(\\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0}\\right) (-1 \\cdot E^{-2}) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p_{\\min}}{\\partial E} = - \\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0 E^2} $$\nNow, we evaluate this derivative at the given values, $R_0 = 12$ and $E = 0.9$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p_{\\min}}{\\partial E} \\bigg|_{R_0=12, E=0.9} = - \\frac{12 - 1}{12 \\cdot (0.9)^2} = - \\frac{11}{12 \\cdot 0.81} = - \\frac{11}{9.72} $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p_{\\min}}{\\partial E} \\approx -1.1316872... $$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we obtain:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p_{\\min}}{\\partial E} \\approx -1.132 $$\nThis negative value indicates that as vaccine efficacy $E$ increases, the required minimum coverage $p_{\\min}$ decreases, which is an expected relationship.

It is a standard exercise in theoretical epidemiology. A complete solution will now be provided.\n\nThe population is stratified into two groups: unvaccinated (type $1$) and vaccinated (type $2$). The fraction of the population in each group at the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is $(1-c)$ for type $1$ and $c$ for type $2$. Let $I_1$ and $I_2$ represent the number of infectious individuals in the unvaccinated and vaccinated groups, respectively.\n\nThe basic reproduction number, $R_0$, is related to the baseline transmission rate $\\beta$ and the mean infectious period $1/\\gamma$ by $R_0 = \\beta/\\gamma$. This assumes a standard incidence formulation where the rate of new infections from $I$ infectious individuals into a population of $S$ susceptibles is $\\beta (S/N) I$.\n\nThe next-generation method requires us to define the rates of new infections in each group. Let $\\mathcal{F}_i$ be the rate of new infections in group $i$.\nThe rate of new infections in the unvaccinated group ($\\mathcal{F}_1$) arises from contact with infectious individuals from the unvaccinated group ($I_1$) and the vaccinated group ($I_2$).
