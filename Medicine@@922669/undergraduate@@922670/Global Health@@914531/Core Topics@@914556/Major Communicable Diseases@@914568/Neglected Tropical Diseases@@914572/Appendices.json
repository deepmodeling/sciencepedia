Praziquantel dosing in the field commonly uses the World Health Organization height-based dosing pole as a proxy for the target dose of approximately $40$ mg/kg; for the height ranges relevant here, the associated tablet counts per person are $2$, $2.5$, $3$, or $4$ tablets, where the half-tablet ($0.5$) refers to a scored half of a $600$ mg tablet.

This problem challenges you to look beyond simple operational metrics and calculate the maximum achievable \"effective coverage\" of a drug campaign. By accounting for structural barriers like medical ineligibility and systematic non-adherence, you will learn to identify the hard ceiling on a program's potential impact, a critical concept for evaluating performance and determining if epidemiological goals are even possible to achieve with a given strategy. [@problem_id:4802635]", "problem": "A Ministry of Health is planning a Mass Drug Administration (MDA; Mass Drug Administration) campaign for a neglected tropical disease in a district with a total population of $10{,}000$. Individuals with medical contraindications (for example, pregnancy in the first trimester and specific comorbidities) and those outside the target age range are classified as ineligible. Observational data from prior rounds indicate a stable subgroup of systematic non-adherers who are eligible but never ingest the drug, independent of operational quality in any given round. For this setting, assume that $20$ percent of the total population is ineligible and $10$ percent of the eligible population is systematically non-adherent. Under ideal implementation for all remaining eligible individuals (that is, all adherent eligible individuals are reached and swallow the drug), use fundamental probability and population partitioning to derive the maximum achievable effective coverage, defined as the proportion of the total population that ingests the drug in the round. Express your answer as a decimal fraction of the total population, and round your answer to four significant figures. Do not use a percent sign. Then, using the derived ceiling, explain the implications for meeting commonly referenced effective coverage targets in neglected tropical disease programs (for example, lymphatic filariasis programs often reference minimum effective coverage near $0.65$), focusing on how ineligibility and systematic non-adherence constrain achievable performance even under ideal operational conditions.", "solution": "The primary task is to calculate the maximum achievable effective coverage ($C_{eff}$). This quantity is defined as the number of people who ingest the drug, $N_{ingest}$, divided by the total population, $N_{tot}$.\n\nLet's define the variables based on the problem statement:\n- $N_{tot}$: The total population.\n- $P_{inel}$: The proportion of the total population that is ineligible. This is given as $20\\%$, or $0.20$.\n- $P_{non-adh}$: The proportion of the *eligible* population that is systematically non-adherent. This is given as $10\\%$, or $0.10$.\n\nThe population can be partitioned sequentially. First, we separate the total population, $N_{tot}$, into two mutually exclusive groups: ineligible individuals ($N_{inel}$) and eligible individuals ($N_{el}$).\n\nThe number of ineligible individuals is:\n$$N_{inel} = N_{tot} \\times P_{inel}$$\n\nThe number of eligible individuals is the remainder of the total population:\n$$N_{el} = N_{tot} - N_{inel} = N_{tot} - (N_{tot} \\times P_{inel}) = N_{tot} (1 - P_{inel})$$\n\nNext, the eligible population, $N_{el}$, is itself partitioned into two mutually exclusive groups: systematic non-adherers ($N_{non-adh}$) and adherent eligibles ($N_{adh-el}$). The problem states that systematic non-adherers constitute a proportion $P_{non-adh}$ of the eligible population.\n\nThe number of systematic non-adherers is:\n$$N_{non-adh} = N_{el} \\times P_{non-adh}$$\n\nThese individuals, despite being eligible, will never ingest the drug. The remaining eligible individuals are the adherent eligibles, who will ingest the drug under ideal implementation conditions.\n\nThe number of people who ingest the drug, $N_{ingest}$, is therefore equal to the number of adherent eligible individuals:\n$$N_{ingest} = N_{adh-el} = N_{el} - N_{non-adh} = N_{el} - (N_{el} \\times P_{non-adh}) = N_{el} (1 - P_{non-adh})$$\n\nTo find the effective coverage, $C_{eff}$, we express $N_{ingest}$ in terms of the total population, $N_{tot}$, and the given proportions. We substitute the expression for $N_{el}$:\n$$N_{ingest} = [N_{tot} (1 - P_{inel})] \\times (1 - P_{non-adh})$$\n\nEffective coverage, $C_{eff}$, is the ratio of $N_{ingest}$ to $N_{tot}$:\n$$C_{eff} = \\frac{N_{ingest}}{N_{tot}} = \\frac{N_{tot} (1 - P_{inel}) (1 - P_{non-adh})}{N_{tot}}$$\n\nThe $N_{tot}$ terms cancel, yielding a general formula for the maximum achievable effective coverage that is independent of the total population size:\n$$C_{eff} = (1 - P_{inel}) (1 - P_{non-adh})$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $P_{inel} = 0.20$\n- $P_{non-adh} = 0.10$\n\n$$C_{eff} = (1 - 0.20) \\times (1 - 0.10)$$\n$$C_{eff} = 0.80 \\times 0.90$$\n$$C_{eff} = 0.72$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$C_{eff} = 0.7200$$\n\nUsing the absolute numbers from the problem provides a concrete verification:\n- $N_{tot} = 10,000$\n- Number of ineligible: $N_{inel} = 10,000 \\times 0.20 = 2,000$\n- Number of eligible: $N_{el} = 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000$\n- Number of systematic non-adherers (from the eligible pool): $N_{non-adh} = 8,000 \\times 0.10 = 800$\n- Number of people who ingest the drug (adherent eligibles): $N_{ingest} = 8,000 - 800 = 7,200$\n- Effective coverage: $C_{eff} = \\frac{7,200}{10,000} = 0.72$\n\nThe result is consistent.\n\nThe calculated maximum achievable effective coverage of $0.7200$ represents a hard, structural ceiling on program performance. This ceiling is not due to any failure in the execution of the MDA campaign (e.g., logistics, drug supply, or health worker performance), which is assumed to be ideal. Instead, it is imposed by two population characteristics that are external to operational control:\n1.  **Ineligibility ($20\\%$):** This segment of the population cannot be treated for valid medical reasons. They are removed from the potential pool of treated individuals from the outset.\n2.  **Systematic Non-Adherence ($10\\%$ of eligibles):** This subgroup makes a consistent choice not to participate. Their behavior is a structural barrier that is typically resistant to standard mobilization efforts within a given MDA round.\n\nThe implication for meeting a common NTD target, such as the minimum effective coverage of $0.65$ required for interrupting the transmission of lymphatic filariasis, is profound. The theoretical \"performance window\" for the program managers is the difference between the maximum achievable coverage ($0.72$) and the minimum target for epidemiological success ($0.65$).\n\n$$ \\text{Performance Window} = C_{eff, max} - C_{target} = 0.72 - 0.65 = 0.07 $$\n\nThis extremely narrow margin of $0.07$ (or $7\\%$) signifies that there is very little room for any operational error. To achieve the $0.65$ target, the program must successfully treat at least $\\frac{0.65}{0.72} \\approx 90.3\\%$ of the *adherent eligible* population. Any combination of operational challenges—such as individuals being absent on the day of distribution, temporary refusals, incomplete geographic access, or drug stockouts—that prevents more than approximately $9.7\\%$ of the adherent eligible population from being treated will result in failure to meet the transmission interruption threshold.\n\nIn conclusion, the presence of significant ineligible and systematically non-adherent subgroups structurally constrains the potential impact of an MDA. It makes achieving epidemiological targets highly sensitive to operational fidelity. If these subgroups are large enough, the maximum achievable coverage ceiling ($C_{eff}$) could fall below the required target ($C_{target}$), making transmission interruption via MDA alone a mathematical impossibility. This underscores the critical need for programs to accurately measure these population parameters and, where necessary, to deploy complementary public health strategies beyond MDA to achieve disease control and elimination goals.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7200}$$", "id": "4802635"}]}
