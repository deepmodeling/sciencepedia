The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet $C$ be the event that a patient is cured, and let $A$ be the event that a patient is adherent to the treatment. The problem provides the following conditional probabilities for any treatment strategy:\n- The probability of cure given adherence is $P(C|A) = c$.\n- The probability of cure given non-adherence, denoted by the complement event $A^c$, is $P(C|A^c) = 0$.\n\nThe overall probability of cure for a given strategy, which corresponds to the expected cure proportion in a large population, can be calculated using the law of total probability:\n$$P(C) = P(C|A)P(A) + P(C|A^c)P(A^c)$$\nGiven that $P(A) = p$, the probability of non-adherence is $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - p$. Substituting the known values into the equation:\n$$P(C) = c \\cdot p + 0 \\cdot (1 - p)$$\n$$P(C) = c \\cdot p$$\nThis expression represents the expected cure proportion for a strategy defined by adherence probability $p$ and conditional cure probability $c$.\n\nWe now apply this general formula to the two specific strategies, DOTS and SAT.\nLet $E_{\\mathrm{DOTS}}$ be the expected cure proportion under the DOTS strategy. The parameters for DOTS are $p_{\\mathrm{DOTS}} = 0.90$ and $c = 0.95$.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{DOTS}} = c \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{DOTS}}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{DOTS}} = 0.95 \\times 0.90 = 0.855$$\n\nLet $E_{\\mathrm{SAT}}$ be the expected cure proportion under the SAT strategy. The parameters for SAT are $p_{\\mathrm{SAT}} = 0.70$ and $c = 0.95$.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{SAT}} = c \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{SAT}}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{SAT}} = 0.95 \\times 0.70 = 0.665$$\n\nThe problem asks for the absolute increase in expected treatment success under DOTS relative to SAT. This quantity, denoted by $\\Delta E$, is the difference between the two expected cure proportions:\n$$\\Delta E = E_{\\mathrm{DOTS}} - E_{\\mathrm{SAT}}$$\nWe can express this symbolically first:\n$$\\Delta E = c \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{DOTS}} - c \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{SAT}} = c(p_{\\mathrm{DOTS}} - p_{\\mathrm{SAT}})$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values to compute the final answer:\n$$\\Delta E = 0.95 \\times (0.90 - 0.70)$$\n$$\\Delta E = 0.95 \\times 0.20$$\n$$\\Delta E = 0.19$$\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.
