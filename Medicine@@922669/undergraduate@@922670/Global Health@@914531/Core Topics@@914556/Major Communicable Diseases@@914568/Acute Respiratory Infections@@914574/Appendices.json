Pediatric ARI is a leading cause of morbidity, and the district has implemented a surveillance system that allows estimation of exposure prevalence and relative risks from a published exposure–response function. For the pediatric population, households fall into three exposure categories with the following prevalences: unexposed (clean fuels) with prevalence $p_{0} = 0.40$, low biomass smoke exposure with prevalence $p_{1} = 0.35$, and high biomass smoke exposure with prevalence $p_{2} = 0.25$. The exposure–response function, summarized from a meta-analysis of household air pollution studies, yields category-specific relative risks for ARI: $RR_{0} = 1$ for unexposed, $RR_{1} = 1.25$ for low exposure, and $RR_{2} = 2.00$ for high exposure.

The population is stratified into $k=3$ exposure categories, indexed by $i=0, 1, 2$, corresponding to unexposed, low exposure, and high exposure, respectively.\nThe prevalence of each exposure category is given by $p_i$, where:\n$p_0 = 0.40$\n$p_1 = 0.35$\n$p_2 = 0.25$\nNote that $\\sum_{i=0}^{2} p_i = 0.40 + 0.35 + 0.25 = 1.00$, as expected.\n\nLet $I_b$ be the baseline incidence of Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) in the unexposed population (category $0$).\nThe problem states a multiplicative risk model, where the incidence in exposure category $i$, denoted $I_i$, is given by:\n$$I_i = I_b \\times RR_i$$\nwhere $RR_i$ is the relative risk for category $i$.

The language is objective and the parameter values are scientifically plausible.\n\n### Part 1: Homogeneous Mixing\n\nThe problem asks for the minimal immune fraction, $H$, required to prevent sustained transmission of an acute respiratory infection (ARI) in a homogeneously mixing population. The basic reproduction number is given as $R_0 = 2.6$.\n\nThe effective reproduction number, $R_e$, is defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a single infectious individual in a population that is not fully susceptible. For a homogeneously mixing population, $R_e$ is related to the basic reproduction number $R_0$ and the fraction of the population that is susceptible, $s$, by the equation:\n$$\nR_e = R_0 s\n$$\nFor an epidemic to die out, the number of new infections generated by each case must be, on average, less than one. This corresponds to the condition:\n$$\nR_e < 1\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $R_e$, we get:\n$$\nR_0 s < 1\n$$\nThis implies that for the epidemic to be controlled, the susceptible fraction of the population must be below a critical threshold:\n$$\ns < \\frac{1}{R_0}\n$$\nThe immune fraction of the population, $H$, is the complement of the susceptible fraction, $s$. Thus, $H = 1 - s$, or $s = 1 - H$. Substituting this into the inequality gives:\n$$\n1 - H < \\frac{1}{R_0}\n$$\nRearranging for $H$, we find the condition for the immune fraction:\n$$\nH > 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}\n$$\nThe minimal immune fraction required to prevent sustained transmission is therefore the critical herd immunity threshold, which is given by the equality:\n$$\nH = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}\n$$\nUsing the given value $R_0 = 2.6$, we calculate the numerical value of $H$:\n$$\nH = 1 - \\frac{1}{2.6} = 1 - \\frac{10}{26} = 1 - \\frac{5}{13} = \\frac{8}{13}\n$$\nAs a decimal fraction, this is approximately $0.6153846...$.

The formula is given as $K_{ij} = T \\tau s_i c_{ji}$, where $T$ is the infectious period, $\\tau$ is the transmission probability, $s_i$ is the susceptibility of group $i$, and $c_{ji}$ is the contact rate of group $j$ with group $i$.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- $T = 4$\n- $\\tau = 0.02$\n- Susceptibilities: $s_C = s_1 = 1.0$, $s_A = s_2 = 0.7$\n- Contact rates: $c_{CC} = c_{11} = 16$, $c_{CA} = c_{21} = 4$ (contacts made by children), $c_{AC} = c_{12} = 2$, $c_{AA} = c_{22} = 8$ (contacts made by adults).

The vaccine has efficacy $e=0.85$ and is applied with uniform coverage $v$ to both groups. Vaccination reduces the susceptibility of each group. The average susceptibility in group $i$ after vaccination, $s'_i$, is the baseline susceptibility $s_i$ multiplied by the fraction of the group that is not effectively immunized, which is $(1 - ve)$:\n$$\ns'_i = s_i(1 - ve)\n$$\nThe new next-generation matrix, $\\mathbf{K}_v$, is constructed with these new susceptibilities:\n$$\nK_{v,ij} = T \\tau s'_i c_{ji} = T \\tau s_i(1 - ve) c_{ji} = (1 - ve) K_{ij}\n$$\nThis means the entire matrix is scaled by the factor $(1 - ve)$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_v = (1 - ve)\\mathbf{K}\n$$\nThe effective reproduction number, $R_e$, is the spectral radius of $\\mathbf{K}_v$. Since scaling a matrix scales its eigenvalues by the same factor, we have:\n$$\nR_e = \\rho(\\mathbf{K}_v) = (1 - ve)\\rho(\\mathbf{K}) = (1 - ve)R_0\n$$\nTo prevent an epidemic, we require $R_e < 1$.
