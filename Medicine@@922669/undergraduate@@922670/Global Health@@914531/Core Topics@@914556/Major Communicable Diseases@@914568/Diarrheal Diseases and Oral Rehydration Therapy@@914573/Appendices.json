This specimen is consistent with osmotic diarrhea.", "solution": "The core task is to calculate the stool osmotic gap (SOG) and interpret the result.\n\n**1. Definition and First Principles**\nThe osmolality of a solution is a colligative property, meaning it depends on the number of solute particles per unit mass of solvent, not on the identity or charge of the particles. The stool osmotic gap represents the concentration of unmeasured, osmotically active solutes. It is defined as the difference between the total measured (or assumed) stool osmolality and the osmolality contributed by the major measured electrolytes.\n$$ \\text{SOG} = (\\text{Total Stool Osmolality}) - (\\text{Calculated Electrolyte Osmolality}) $$\nThe problem states to assume the total stool osmolality, $\\text{Osm}_{\\text{stool}}$, is approximately equal to plasma osmolality, which is given as $290\\,\\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$.\n$$ \\text{Osm}_{\\text{stool}} \\approx 290\\,\\mathrm{mOsm/kg} $$\nThe calculated electrolyte osmolality, $\\text{Osm}_{\\text{electrolytes}}$, is determined from the concentrations of the major cations, sodium ($[\\mathrm{Na}^+]$) and potassium ($[\\mathrm{K}^+]$). The principle of electroneutrality dictates that the total concentration of positive charges (cations) in a solution must be balanced by an equal concentration of negative charges (anions). Therefore, to estimate the total number of electrolyte particles, we multiply the sum of the major cation concentrations by $2$, approximating that each cation is paired with an unmeasured anion (such as $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$ or $\\mathrm{HCO}_3^-$).\n$$ \\text{Osm}_{\\text{electrolytes}} \\approx 2 \\cdot ([\\mathrm{Na}^+] + [\\mathrm{K}^+]) $$\nThis formula is the standard clinical approximation for stool electrolyte osmolality.\n\n**2. Calculation**\nUsing the given values:\n- $[\\mathrm{Na}^+] = 80\\,\\mathrm{mEq/L}$\n- $[\\mathrm{K}^+] = 60\\,\\mathrm{mEq/L}$\n\nFirst, calculate the contribution of measured electrolytes to osmolality. In dilute aqueous solutions like stool, it is a standard clinical convention to treat $\\mathrm{mEq/L}$ for monovalent ions as numerically equivalent to $\\mathrm{mmol/L}$, which in turn is approximated as $\\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$.\n$$ \\text{Osm}_{\\text{electrolytes}} \\approx 2 \\cdot (80 + 60)\\,\\mathrm{mOsm/kg} = 2 \\cdot 140\\,\\mathrm{mOsm/kg} = 280\\,\\mathrm{mOsm/kg} $$\nNext, calculate the stool osmotic gap:\n$$ \\text{SOG} = 290\\,\\mathrm{mOsm/kg} - 280\\,\\mathrm{mOsm/kg} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mOsm/kg} $$\n\n**3. Interpretation**\nThe magnitude of the SOG helps differentiate between the two major types of diarrhea:\n- **Secretory Diarrhea**: Caused by active intestinal secretion of electrolytes, driving water into the lumen. In this case, the stool osmolality is primarily accounted for by these electrolytes ($[\\mathrm{Na}^+]$, $[\\mathrm{K}^+]$, and their corresponding anions). The concentration of other osmotically active substances is low, resulting in a **small** stool osmotic gap. The standard cutoff is $\\text{SOG} < 50\\,\\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$.\n- **Osmotic Diarrhea**: Caused by the presence of poorly absorbed, osmotically active substances (e.g., lactose, sorbitol, magnesium ions) in the intestinal lumen. These substances retain water in the gut. The stool osmolality is elevated due to these unmeasured osmoles, not primarily electrolytes. This results in a **large** stool osmotic gap. The standard cutoff is $\\text{SOG} > 100\\,\\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$ (sometimes cited as $> 125\\,\\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$).\n- A gap between $50$ and $100\\,\\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$ may indicate a mixed etiology.\n\nOur calculated SOG is $10\\,\\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$. Since $10\\,\\mathrm{mOsm/kg} < 50\\,\\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$, the findings are strongly consistent with secretory diarrhea.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.
