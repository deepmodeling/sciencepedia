This is quantified by Vaccine Efficacy ($VE$), a measure of the proportional reduction in disease among vaccinated individuals.

Assume the cohorts are closed (no loss to follow-up), exposures are comparable, and disease risk is accumulated over the period without competing risks. Let the cumulative incidence over the fixed period be called the attack rate. Starting from the definition of vaccine efficacy (VE) as $VE = 1 - \\text{RR}$, where $\\text{RR}$ denotes the Relative Risk (RR), and using the standard definition of $\\text{RR}$ in terms of risks, derive an expression that relates $VE$ to the attack rates observed in the vaccine and control arms.

The problem states that the attack rate is defined as the cumulative incidence over the fixed study period. In epidemiology, cumulative incidence is a measure of risk. Therefore, $AR_v$ is the risk of developing the infection in the vaccinated group, and $AR_u$ is the risk of developing the infection in the unvaccinated group.\n\nThe Relative Risk ($\\text{RR}$) is a measure of the association between an exposure (vaccination, in this case) and an outcome (infection). It is defined as the ratio of the risk of the outcome in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group. In the context of vaccine studies, this is the ratio of the risk in the vaccinated group to the risk in the unvaccinated group.\n\n$$ \\text{RR} = \\frac{\\text{Risk in vaccinated group}}{\\text{Risk in unvaccinated group}} = \\frac{AR_v}{AR_u} $$\n\nThe problem provides the definition of Vaccine Efficacy ($VE$) as:\n\n$$ VE = 1 - \\text{RR} $$\n\nTo derive the expression relating $VE$ to the attack rates, we substitute the definition of $\\text{RR}$ in terms of $AR_v$ and $AR_u$ into the equation for $VE$.\n\n$$ VE = 1 - \\frac{AR_v}{AR_u} $$\n\nThis is the general expression for vaccine efficacy based on the attack rates in the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts.

The basic reproduction number is defined as the average number of secondary infections produced by a single typical infectious case in a wholly susceptible population, denoted by $R_{0}$.
