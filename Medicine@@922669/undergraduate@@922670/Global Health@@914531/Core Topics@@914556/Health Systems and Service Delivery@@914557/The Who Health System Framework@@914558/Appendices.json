Let Effective Coverage (EC) be defined as the probability that an individual who needs hypertension control actually receives a service that is of sufficient quality to achieve the intended health benefit.

Let us consider the population of individuals who have a true need for hypertension control. Within this population, we define a cascade of three sequential events required to achieve effective coverage:\nLet $A$ be the event that an individual's need for care is correctly recognized.\nLet $B$ be the event that the individual utilizes the appropriate health service.\nLet $C$ be the event that the service received is of sufficient quality to be effective.\n\nEffective Coverage (EC) is the probability that an individual with a true need progresses through the entire cascade, meaning all three events $A$, $B$, and $C$ occur. This corresponds to the joint probability of these events, $P(A \\cap B \\cap C)$.\n\nTask 1: Derive the expression for EC.\nUsing the chain rule of probability, we can express this joint probability as a product of conditional probabilities:\n$$EC = P(A \\cap B \\cap C) = P(A) \\times P(B|A) \\times P(C|A \\cap B)$$\nNow, we map the given parameters to these probabilistic terms:\n1.  $N$ is defined as \"the fraction of true need that is correctly recognized.\" This is the unconditional probability of event $A$ occurring within the population of need. Thus, $N = P(A)$.\n2.  $U$ is defined as \"the fraction that utilizes appropriate services given recognized need.\" This is the conditional probability of utilizing services (event $B$) given that the need has been recognized (event $A$). Thus, $U = P(B|A)$.\n3.  $Q$ is defined as \"the fraction receiving sufficiently high quality given utilization.\" In the context of the cascade, utilization (event $B$) implies that need was first recognized (event $A$). Therefore, this is the conditional probability of receiving quality care (event $C$) given that events $A$ and $B$ have both occurred. Thus, $Q = P(C|A \\cap B)$.\n\nSubstituting these parameters into the chain rule expression, we derive the formula for Effective Coverage:\n$$EC = N \\times U \\times Q$$\nThis equation shows that EC is the simple product of the probabilities of success at each stage of the care cascade.\n\nTask 2: Compute EC for the given values.\nThe problem provides the following values for the parameters:\n$N = 0.9$\n$U = 0.7$\n$Q = 0.8$\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived expression:\n$$EC = (0.9) \\times (0.7) \\times (0.8)$$\n$$EC = (0.63) \\times (0.8)$$\n$$EC = 0.504$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to $4$ significant figures. To represent $0.504$ with four significant figures, we add a trailing zero.\n$$EC = 0.5040$$\n\nTask 3: Interpret the result.\nThe computed Effective Coverage is $EC = 0.5040$, which means that only $50.4\\%$ of individuals in the district who truly need hypertension control are actually receiving care that is effective. This signifies a substantial gap in the health system's performance, as nearly half of the need is not being met effectively.\n\nWe can map the factors $N$, $U$, and $Q$ to the WHO's $6$ health system building blocks to understand the sources of this gap:\n- **$N$ (Need Recognition, $0.9$):** This component depends on community outreach, screening programs, and accurate diagnosis. It most directly relates to **Health Service Delivery** (how services are organized to identify patients) and **Health Information Systems** (using data to identify at-risk populations and track screening coverage).\n- **$U$ (Utilization, $0.7$):** This is the \"leakiest\" stage in this specific cascade. It reflects barriers to access after a diagnosis is made. It is strongly influenced by **Financing** (affordability of services and transport), the **Health Workforce** (availability and distribution of clinicians), and **Health Service Delivery** (geographic accessibility, hours of operation, waiting times).\n- **$Q$ (Quality, $0.8$):** This component is determined by the adherence to evidence-based clinical protocols. It is primarily a function of the **Health Workforce** (training, skills, motivation), the availability of **Medical Products, Vaccines & Technologies** (e.g., appropriate, non-expired antihypertensive medications), and **Leadership and Governance** (establishment and enforcement of clinical standards and quality assurance mechanisms).\n\nGiven that the largest drop-off occurs at the utilization stage ($U=0.7$), a key policy priority would be to address the barriers preventing individuals with a recognized need from accessing care. The Ministry of Health should prioritize investigating why $30\\%$ of this group fails to utilize services. A potential policy action, following such an investigation, could be to improve the **Financing** building block by reducing or eliminating out-of-pocket costs for essential hypertension services and medications, which is a common barrier to utilization for chronic conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5040}$$", "id": "5006366"}, {"introduction": "The health workforce is not a static resource but a dynamic system with professionals entering and leaving over time. This practice applies a fundamental planning tool—the stock-and-flow model—to project the future size of the workforce, a critical component of the WHO framework.
