All necessary data and definitions are provided, and the problem is internally consistent. We may proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two distinct measures of health inequality: the Slope Index of Inequality (SII) and the simple absolute difference in coverage between the richest and poorest population quintiles.\n\nFirst, we calculate the Slope Index of Inequality (SII). The problem defines the SII as the absolute difference in predicted health coverage between the theoretical extremes of the socioeconomic rank distribution, where the predictions are derived from an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression of coverage ($y$) on a relative rank ($r$). The linear regression model is of the form:\n$$ \\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 r $$\nwhere $\\hat{y}$ is the predicted coverage, $\\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\\beta_1$ is the slope, and $r$ is the relative rank from $0$ (poorest) to $1$ (richest).\n\nThe given data consist of $n=5$ pairs of observations $(r_i, y_i)$:\nThe relative ranks for the five quintiles are $r = \\{0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9\\}$.\nThe corresponding antenatal care coverage proportions are $y = \\{0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 0.95\\}$.\n\nThe OLS estimator for the slope coefficient, $\\beta_1$, is calculated as:\n$$ \\beta_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (r_i - \\bar{r})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (r_i - \\bar{r})^2} = \\frac{S_{ry}}{S_{rr}} $$\nwhere $\\bar{r}$ and $\\bar{y}$ are the sample means of the rank and coverage values, respectively.\n\nWe begin by computing the sample means:\n$$ \\bar{r} = \\frac{1}{5} \\sum_{i=1}^{5} r_i = \\frac{0.1 + 0.3 + 0.5 + 0.7 + 0.9}{5} = \\frac{2.5}{5} = 0.5 $$\n$$ \\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{5} \\sum_{i=1}^{5} y_i = \\frac{0.60 + 0.70 + 0.80 + 0.90 + 0.95}{5} = \\frac{3.95}{5} = 0.79 $$\n\nNext, we compute the sum of cross-products of deviations, $S_{ry}$:\n$$ S_{ry} = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} (r_i - \\bar{r})(y_i - \\bar{y}) $$\n$$ S_{ry} = (0.1 - 0.5)(0.60 - 0.79) + (0.3 - 0.5)(0.70 - 0.79) + (0.5 - 0.5)(0.80 - 0.79) + (0.7 - 0.5)(0.90 - 0.79) + (0.9 - 0.5)(0.95 - 0.79) $$\n$$ S_{ry} = (-0.4)(-0.19) + (-0.2)(-0.09) + (0)(0.01) + (0.2)(0.11) + (0.4)(0.16) $$\n$$ S_{ry} = 0.076 + 0.018 + 0 + 0.022 + 0.064 = 0.18 $$\n\nThen, we compute the sum of squared deviations for the rank, $S_{rr}$:\n$$ S_{rr} = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} (r_i - \\bar{r})^2 $$\n$$ S_{rr} = (0.1 - 0.5)^2 + (0.3 - 0.5)^2 + (0.5 - 0.5)^2 + (0.7 - 0.5)^2 + (0.9 - 0.5)^2 $$\n$$ S_{rr} = (-0.4)^2 + (-0.2)^2 + (0)^2 + (0.2)^2 + (0.4)^2 $$\n$$ S_{rr} = 0.16 + 0.04 + 0 + 0.04 + 0.16 = 0.40 $$\n\nNow we can calculate the slope, $\\beta_1$:\n$$ \\beta_1 = \\frac{S_{ry}}{S_{rr}} = \\frac{0.18}{0.40} = 0.45 $$\n\nThe SII is the absolute difference between the predicted coverage at the extremes of the rank scale, $r=1$ and $r=0$.\n$$ \\hat{y}(r=1) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(1) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 $$\n$$ \\hat{y}(r=0) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(0) = \\beta_0 $$\n$$ \\text{SII} = |\\hat{y}(r=1) - \\hat{y}(r=0)| = |(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1) - \\beta_0| = |\\beta_1| $$\nThus, the SII is simply the absolute value of the slope coefficient.\n$$ \\text{SII} = |0.45| = 0.45 $$\n\nSecond, we calculate the absolute inequality between the poorest and richest quintiles.

A widely used financial risk protection indicator is the catastrophic health expenditure criterion based on the capacity-to-pay approach, which treats subsistence needs as non-discretionary. Consider a household with annual total consumption $X$, subsistence food expenditure $F$ (a normative estimate of minimum required food spending), and out-of-pocket healthcare payments $O$. Under the capacity-to-pay approach, subsistence food expenditure $F$ is excluded from the resources available for health spending, and a policy threshold $z$ specifies the maximum acceptable share of out-of-pocket payments in capacity to pay.

The solution will proceed by first deriving the household's capacity to pay, then determining if the health expenditure is catastrophic, and finally quantifying the catastrophic gap. All mathematical entities will be expressed in LaTeX as required.\n\nThe given parameters for the household are:\n- Total annual consumption: $X = 3{,}000$\n- Subsistence food expenditure: $F = 1{,}200$\n- Out-of-pocket healthcare payments: $O = 600$\n- Policy threshold for catastrophic expenditure: $z = 0.40$\n\nThe first step is to determine the household's capacity to pay, denoted by $C$. The problem states that capacity to pay is based on total consumption excluding subsistence food expenditure. This is a non-discretionary expense, so the resources available for other spending, including healthcare, are what remains after accounting for it. For households whose total consumption $X$ is greater than their subsistence food needs $F$, the capacity to pay is the difference between these two amounts. If total consumption is less than or equal to subsistence food needs, the capacity to pay is zero. This can be expressed as:\n$$\nC = \\max(0, X - F)\n$$\nUsing the provided values:\n$X = 3{,}000$ and $F = 1{,}200$.\nSince $X > F$, the capacity to pay is:\n$$\nC = X - F = 3{,}000 - 1{,}200 = 1{,}800\n$$\nThe household’s capacity to pay is $1{,}800$ USD per year.\n\nThe second step is to determine whether the household's out-of-pocket health payments are catastrophic. Catastrophic health expenditure occurs when the share of out-of-pocket payments in capacity to pay meets or exceeds the policy threshold $z$. Let this share be denoted by $S$.\n$$\nS = \\frac{O}{C}\n$$\nThe condition for catastrophic expenditure is $S \\ge z$. Using the given value $O = 600$ and the calculated value $C = 1{,}800$:\n$$\nS = \\frac{600}{1{,}800} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nNow, we compare this share $S$ to the policy threshold $z = 0.40$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.3333...\n$$\nSince $0.3333...  0.40$, we have $S  z$. Therefore, the household’s out-of-pocket health payments are not considered catastrophic under this criterion.\n\nThe final step is to quantify the catastrophic gap, which is defined as the \"nonnegative excess of out-of-pocket payments above the threshold share of capacity to pay.\" Let the catastrophic gap be denoted by $G$. The threshold amount of expenditure is the maximum acceptable share $z$ of the capacity to pay $C$, which is $z \\cdot C$. The excess payment is the amount by which the actual out-of-pocket payment $O$ exceeds this threshold amount, i.e., $O - z \\cdot C$. Since the gap must be nonnegative, we take the maximum of this value and zero.\nThe formula for the catastrophic gap is:\n$$\nG = \\max(0, O - z \\cdot C)\n$$\nWe have all the necessary values: $O = 600$, $z = 0.40$, and $C = 1{,}800$.\nFirst, calculate the threshold expenditure level:\n$$\nz \\cdot C = 0.40 \\times 1{,}800 = 720\n$$\nNow, calculate the excess payment:\n$$\nO - z \\cdot C = 600 - 720 = -120\n$$\nFinally, apply the nonnegativity condition to find the catastrophic gap $G$:\n$$\nG = \\max(0, -120) = 0\n$$\nThe catastrophic gap is $0$ USD.
