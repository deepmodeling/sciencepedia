Assume the following foundational definitions and facts: the relative risk ($RR$) is defined as the ratio of the risk among those exposed to the intervention to the risk among those not exposed, and the population risk is the weighted average of subgroup risks according to coverage. Let the risk of neonatal death among newborns without a CHW early postnatal visit be $r_{0}$, and let the risk among those receiving a visit be $r_{1}$. The intervention’s effect size is a relative risk of $RR = 0.80$ for neonatal deaths among those receiving the visit compared to those who do not.

Express your final answer as a decimal fraction, rounded to four significant figures. No units are required in the final answer.", "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a formalizable problem in epidemiology based on standard definitions and plausible data. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $r_0$ be the risk of neonatal death for newborns who do not receive a Community Health Worker (CHW) visit, and let $r_1$ be the risk for newborns who do receive the visit. The problem states that the relative risk, $RR$, is the ratio of the risk in the exposed (intervention) group to the risk in the unexposed (control) group.\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$RR = \\frac{r_1}{r_0}$$\nFrom this definition, we can express the risk in the intervention group in terms of the risk in the control group:\n$$r_1 = RR \\cdot r_0$$\n\nThe problem defines the population risk as the weighted average of the subgroup risks, with the weights determined by the coverage level. Let $c$ be the coverage of the CHW intervention, representing the proportion of newborns who receive the visit. Consequently, the proportion of newborns who do not receive the visit is $1-c$.\nThe total population neonatal mortality rate, denoted as $R(c)$, can be expressed as:\n$$R(c) = c \\cdot r_1 + (1-c) \\cdot r_0$$\n\nTo analyze the effect of coverage changes, we can substitute the expression for $r_1$ into the equation for $R(c)$:\n$$R(c) = c \\cdot (RR \\cdot r_0) + (1-c) \\cdot r_0$$\nWe can factor out the baseline risk $r_0$:\n$$R(c) = r_0 \\cdot (c \\cdot RR + 1 - c)$$\nThis can be rearranged to a more convenient form:\n$$R(c) = r_0 \\cdot [1 - c \\cdot (1 - RR)]$$\nThis equation gives the overall population risk as a function of coverage $c$, the intervention's relative risk $RR$, and the baseline risk $r_0$.\n\nThe problem specifies an increase in coverage from an initial level $c_0 = 0.30$ to a final level $c_1 = 0.70$. We can calculate the population risk at each of these coverage levels.\nThe initial population risk at coverage $c_0$ is:\n$$R(c_0) = r_0 \\cdot [1 - c_0 \\cdot (1 - RR)]$$\nThe final population risk at coverage $c_1$ is:\n$$R(c_1) = r_0 \\cdot [1 - c_1 \\cdot (1 - RR)]$$\n\nWe are asked to find the proportional reduction in the population neonatal mortality rate, relative to the initial rate at coverage $c_0$. The proportional reduction, let's call it $P$, is defined as the absolute reduction divided by the initial value:\n$$P = \\frac{R(c_0) - R(c_1)}{R(c_0)}$$\nThis can be simplified to:\n$$P = 1 - \\frac{R(c_1)}{R(c_0)}$$\nNow, we substitute our expressions for $R(c_0)$ and $R(c_1)$:\n$$P = 1 - \\frac{r_0 \\cdot [1 - c_1 \\cdot (1 - RR)]}{r_0 \\cdot [1 - c_0 \\cdot (1 - RR)]}$$\nThe baseline risk $r_0$ cancels from the numerator and the denominator, confirming that its specific value is not needed to solve the problem.\n$$P = 1 - \\frac{1 - c_1(1 - RR)}{1 - c_0(1 - RR)}$$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n$RR = 0.80$\n$c_0 = 0.30$\n$c_1 = 0.70$\n\nFirst, we calculate the term $(1 - RR)$:\n$$1 - RR = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$$\nNow, we substitute all numerical values into the expression for $P$:\n$$P = 1 - \\frac{1 - 0.70 \\cdot (0.20)}{1 - 0.30 \\cdot (0.20)}$$\nWe calculate the numerator and denominator of the fraction:\nNumerator = $1 - (0.70 \\cdot 0.20) = 1 - 0.14 = 0.86$\nDenominator = $1 - (0.30 \\cdot 0.20) = 1 - 0.06 = 0.94$\nSo, the expression for $P$ becomes:\n$$P = 1 - \\frac{0.86}{0.94}$$\nAlternatively, one can express $P$ as:\n$$P = \\frac{(1 - c_0(1 - RR)) - (1 - c_1(1 - RR))}{1 - c_0(1 - RR)} = \\frac{c_1(1 - RR) - c_0(1 - RR)}{1 - c_0(1 - RR)} = \\frac{(c_1 - c_0)(1 - RR)}{1 - c_0(1 - RR)}$$\nUsing this form:\n$$P = \\frac{(0.70 - 0.30)(0.20)}{1 - 0.30(0.20)} = \\frac{0.40 \\cdot 0.20}{1 - 0.06} = \\frac{0.08}{0.94}$$\nBoth formulations yield the same result. Now we calculate the numerical value:\n$$P = \\frac{0.08}{0.94} \\approx 0.08510638...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $0$, $8$, $5$, $1$, and $0$. Since the leading zero before the decimal point is not significant, the first significant digit is $8$. The fourth is $0$. The fifth significant digit is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant digit. The digit $0$ rounded up becomes $1$.\nTherefore, the proportional reduction is approximately $0.08511$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.08511}$$", "id": "5005277"}, {"introduction": "Community Health Workers are frequently at the forefront of public health screening campaigns, but the diagnostic tools they use are not infallible.

The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a randomly selected adult from the district has hypertension (the disease), and let $\\neg D$ be the event that the adult does not have hypertension. Let $+$ denote the event that the screening device yields a positive result, and $-$ denote a negative result.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are:\n1.  Prevalence of hypertension: $\\Pr(D) = 0.25$.\n2.  Sensitivity of the screening device: $\\Pr(+ \\mid D) = 0.85$.\n3.  Specificity of the screening device: $\\Pr(- \\mid \\neg D) = 0.90$.\n\nFrom these, we can derive two additional required probabilities:\n- The probability of not having the disease: $\\Pr(\\neg D) = 1 - \\Pr(D) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\n- The probability of a positive test in a person without the disease (the false positive rate), which is $1$ minus the specificity: $\\Pr(+ \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - \\Pr(- \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n\nThe goal is to find the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), which is the conditional probability that a person has the disease given that they tested positive, denoted as $\\Pr(D \\mid +)$.\n\nTo derive the expression for PPV, we use Bayes' theorem:\n$$ \\Pr(D \\mid +) = \\frac{\\Pr(+ \\mid D) \\Pr(D)}{\\Pr(+)} $$\nThe numerator contains terms that are given: the sensitivity $\\Pr(+ \\mid D)$ and the prevalence $\\Pr(D)$. The denominator, $\\Pr(+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test in this population. We can calculate $\\Pr(+)$ using the law of total probability, which sums the probabilities of a positive test across the two mutually exclusive groups: those with the disease and those without it.\n$$ \\Pr(+) = \\Pr(+ \\mid D)\\Pr(D) + \\Pr(+ \\mid \\neg D)\\Pr(\\neg D) $$\nThe term $\\Pr(+ \\mid D)\\Pr(D)$ represents the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive (true positives). The term $\\Pr(+ \\mid \\neg D)\\Pr(\\neg D)$ represents the joint probability of not having the disease and testing positive (false positives).\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Pr(+)$ into Bayes' theorem gives the full formula for PPV in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\Pr(D \\mid +) = \\frac{\\Pr(+ \\mid D) \\Pr(D)}{\\Pr(+ \\mid D)\\Pr(D) + \\Pr(+ \\mid \\neg D)\\Pr(\\neg D)} $$\nUsing the fact that $\\Pr(+ \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - \\text{specificity}$ and $\\Pr(\\neg D) = 1 - \\text{prevalence}$, we can write the formula as:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{(\\text{sensitivity}) \\times (\\text{prevalence})}{(\\text{sensitivity}) \\times (\\text{prevalence}) + (1 - \\text{specificity}) \\times (1 - \\text{prevalence})} $$\nThis is the general expression for PPV.\n\nNow, we compute its value for the given context by substituting the numerical values:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.85 \\times 0.25}{0.85 \\times 0.25 + (1 - 0.90) \\times (1 - 0.25)} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.2125}{0.2125 + (0.10) \\times (0.75)} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.2125}{0.2125 + 0.075} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.2125}{0.2875} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV} \\approx 0.7391304... $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we get:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = 0.7391 $$\n\nFinally, we discuss the implications of this result for a screening campaign involving $N=1000$ adults, assuming this group is a random sample of the district's adult population.\n\nThe calculated PPV of $0.7391$ signifies that an individual who receives a positive screen has a $73.91\\%$ probability of actually having hypertension. Conversely, there is a $1 - 0.7391 = 0.2609$, or $26.09\\%$, chance that a positive screen is a false positive. This proportion is a direct consequence of the test characteristics and the underlying disease prevalence in the population.\n\nTo understand the referral load, we can calculate the expected number of individuals in each category in a cohort of $1000$ people.\n- Expected number of adults with hypertension (true disease status): $1000 \\times \\Pr(D) = 1000 \\times 0.25 = 250$ people.\n- Expected number of adults without hypertension: $1000 \\times \\Pr(\\neg D) = 1000 \\times 0.75 = 750$ people.\n\nFrom these two groups, we can calculate the expected number of positive test results:\n- Expected number of True Positives (TP): These are people with the disease who test positive.\n$N_{TP} = 250 \\times \\Pr(+ \\mid D) = 250 \\times 0.85 = 212.5$.\n- Expected number of False Positives (FP): These are people without the disease who test positive.\n$N_{FP} = 750 \\times \\Pr(+ \\mid \\neg D) = 750 \\times 0.10 = 75$.\n\nThe total number of positive screens, and therefore the total referral load for confirmatory evaluation, is the sum of true positives and false positives:\nReferral Load = $N_{TP} + N_{FP} = 212.5 + 75 = 287.5$.\nWe expect approximately $288$ individuals to be referred for further evaluation.\n\nThe proportion of these referrals that represent true disease is $\\frac{N_{TP}}{N_{TP} + N_{FP}} = \\frac{212.5}{287.5}$, which equals our calculated PPV of $\\approx 0.7391$.\nThis means that out of the approximately $288$ people referred by CHWs, we expect only about $213$ ($\\approx 73.91\\%$) to be confirmed cases of hypertension. The remaining $75$ individuals ($\\approx 26.09\\%$) will have been subjected to the anxiety and cost of follow-up testing, only to be found healthy. This highlights a fundamental challenge in population screening: a non-trivial portion of the referral burden and healthcare resources will be directed towards investigating false positives, even with a test that has reasonably high sensitivity and specificity, especially when the disease prevalence is not extremely high.
