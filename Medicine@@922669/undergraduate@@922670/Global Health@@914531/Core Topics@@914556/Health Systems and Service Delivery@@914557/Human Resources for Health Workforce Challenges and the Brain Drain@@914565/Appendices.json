By translating qualitative 'push' and 'pull' factors into a mathematical formula, this practice reveals how policy levers, such as wages or credentialing processes, can influence these critical decisions. [@problem_id:4985465]", "problem": "A low- and middle-income country is experiencing a sustained outflow of nurses, a phenomenon often referred to as the \"brain drain\" in Human Resources for Health (HRH). Consider a nurse deciding whether to migrate to a higher-income destination country. If the nurse migrates, her professional credentials may be recognized with probability $p$, in which case she earns an annual wage $w_{\\text{dest}}$; if they are not recognized (with probability $1-p$), she earns her original annual wage $w_{\\text{src}}$ in a lower-paying role until recognition is achieved. The migration entails an annualized income-equivalent cost $C$ that subsumes financial fees and non-monetary disutility.\n\nStarting from the definition of expected value and the principle of expected utility (EU), where expected utility is the probability-weighted average of income across states of the world minus costs, derive an expression for the net migration incentive defined as the nurse’s expected utility of migrating minus the utility of staying. Let $r = \\frac{w_{\\text{dest}}}{w_{\\text{src}}}$ denote the wage ratio between the destination and source labor markets.\n\nUse the following scientifically realistic parameter values:\n- Source wage $w_{\\text{src}} = \\$12{,}000$ per year,\n- Wage ratio $r = 3.0$,\n- Credential recognition probability $p = 0.70$,\n- Annualized migration cost $C = \\$5{,}000$ per year.\n\nCompute the net migration incentive in United States dollars per year (USD/year) as a single real number.

With no uncertainty, the nurse earns the source wage, $w_{\\text{src}}$. The problem does not specify any costs for staying, so the utility is equivalent to the income.\n$$\nU_{\\text{stay}} = w_{\\text{src}}\n$$\n\nLet $U_{\\text{migrate}}$ be the expected utility of migrating to the destination country.

Mastering this accounting provides a true measure of available service hours, a critical first step in effective health systems management and planning.

This comprehensive exercise demonstrates that there is no single answer, as the 'right' number depends on the planning goal. You will compute staffing requirements using three distinct methodologies—Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN), population-based ratios, and a burden-of-disease model—providing critical insight into selecting the appropriate tool for different contexts, from immediate operational adjustments to long-term investment planning. [@problem_id:4985545]", "problem": "A district health authority is planning staffing for primary care nurses amid a continuing outmigration of trained personnel. Three planning approaches are being considered: Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN), a population-to-provider ratio, and a burden-of-disease-based needs model. The authority wishes to compare their quantitative outputs, understand the strengths and limitations of each, and decide appropriate use cases. The following scientifically sound and internally consistent data are available.\n\nDefinitions and core facts:\n- Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN) estimates staff needs by combining service volumes with time standards for each activity and the annual available working time per staff member, optionally adjusting for category allowance (routine support and non-service activities). Let $S_i$ denote the annual number of service activities of type $i$, $t_i$ the time per activity, $T$ the annual available working time per nurse, and $c$ the category allowance proportion.\n- Population-to-provider ratios express a target number of providers per unit population, commonly used for coarse benchmarking when service-mix data are limited.\n- Burden-of-disease-based models allocate staff time to clinical conditions using epidemiological burden and guideline-recommended contact time, aiming to close unmet need. They rely on high-quality epidemiology and assumptions about coverage goals, such as those aligned with Essential Health Service Packages.\n- Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) represent population health loss but are not directly converted to staff time; burden-of-disease models operationalize DALYs via incidence/prevalence and guideline-based contacts.\n\nDistrict data for nurses in primary care:\n- Population is $P = 250{,}000$.\n- Current staffed full-time equivalents (FTE) is $N_{\\text{current}} = 35$.\n- Expected nurse outmigration rate over the next year is $r_{\\text{out}} = 0.08$ (that is, $8\\%$ per year). Expected recruitment inflow is $N_{\\text{recruit}} = 5$ FTE per year.\n- Annual available working time per nurse is $T = 1{,}680$ hours, after accounting for leave and training.\n- Category allowance proportion is $c = 0.15$.\n- Last year’s service volumes and time standards:\n  • Antenatal care visits $S_{\\text{ANC}} = 20{,}000$ with $t_{\\text{ANC}} = 0.5$ hours per visit.\n  • Facility deliveries $S_{\\text{del}} = 5{,}000$ with $t_{\\text{del}} = 8$ hours per delivery.\n  • Immunization contacts $S_{\\text{imm}} = 50{,}000$ with $t_{\\text{imm}} = \\frac{1}{6}$ hours per contact.\n  • Non-communicable disease (NCD) follow-up visits $S_{\\text{NCD}} = 30{,}000$ with $t_{\\text{NCD}} = \\frac{1}{3}$ hours per visit.\n- The national normative population-to-nurse target for primary care is $1$ nurse per $5{,}000$ population.\n- Burden-of-disease-based planning indicates substantial unmet NCD need: adult population is estimated at $60\\%$ of $P$, NCD prevalence among adults is $15\\%$, and guidelines require $4$ nurse-led follow-up visits per NCD patient per year at $t_{\\text{NCD}} = \\frac{1}{3}$ hours per visit. Other service areas are assumed to be at or near guideline coverage.\n\nTasks:\n1. Using first principles and the above definitions and data, compute the nurse FTE requirement under each approach for the coming year:\n   • WISN, based on observed service volumes and time standards adjusted by $c$ and $T$.\n   • Population-to-provider ratio, using the national target and the district population $P$.\n   • Burden-of-disease-based needs, by replacing observed NCD visits with the guideline-needed NCD visits derived from adult population and prevalence, and then applying the same WISN-style time accounting with $c$ and $T$.\n2. Considering the expected outmigration and recruitment, reason from first principles about immediate versus medium-term planning needs, and identify which approach is best suited for:\n   • Immediate facility-level allocation and redeployment under constrained staffing and continuing brain drain.\n   • Medium-term planning to close coverage gaps and invest in training and retention.\n   • Coarse benchmarking across districts when service-mix data are limited.\n3. Choose the option that correctly states the three computed staffing needs and accurately explains the comparative strengths, limitations, and appropriate use cases of WISN, the population-to-provider ratio, and the burden-of-disease-based model in this setting.\n\nOptions:\nA. WISN yields approximately $47$ FTE; the population-to-provider target yields approximately $50$ FTE; the burden-of-disease-based needs model yields approximately $60$ FTE. WISN’s strength is that it ties staffing to observed workload and annual working time, making it the most suitable for immediate facility-level allocation and redeployment under brain drain; its limitation is potential underestimation of unmet need where access barriers suppress utilization. The population ratio’s strength is simplicity and cross-district comparability when data are scarce; its limitation is ignorance of service mix, acuity, and productivity differences. The burden-of-disease model’s strength is aligning staffing with epidemiology and guideline coverage to close gaps in the medium term; its limitation is reliance on strong epidemiological data and assumption-sensitive conversions from burden to contacts and time.\nB. WISN yields approximately $60$ FTE; the population-to-provider target yields approximately $47$ FTE; the burden-of-disease-based needs model yields approximately $50$ FTE. The population ratio is best for immediate facility-level redeployment under brain drain because it directly captures workload, whereas WISN is mainly for national benchmarking. The burden-of-disease model is superior for short-term decisions because it does not require assumptions and is less data intensive than WISN.\nC. All three methods converge to approximately $50$ FTE in this setting; therefore, they are interchangeable. WISN is prone to systematic overestimation under brain drain because it multiplies category allowances excessively, while the burden-of-disease approach always yields lower figures due to efficiency from guideline standardization, making it the preferred method for rapid redeployment.\nD. WISN yields approximately $47$ FTE; the population-to-provider target yields approximately $50$ FTE; the burden-of-disease-based needs model yields approximately $60$ FTE. The population ratio is ideal for immediate facility-level allocation because it accounts for outmigration via population changes, WISN is limited to long-term planning, and the burden-of-disease model has minimal data needs and should be used for inter-district benchmarking.", "solution": "This problem requires calculating the required nurse FTE under three different models and then evaluating the strengths and use cases of each model.\n\n**1. Calculation of Staffing Requirements**\n\n**a. Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN) Model**\nThis model is based on the observed workload.\n- First, calculate the total annual service workload hours ($W_S$) based on observed volumes:\n  $$ W_S = (20{,}000 \\times 0.5) + (5{,}000 \\times 8) + (50{,}000 \\times \\frac{1}{6}) + (30{,}000 \\times \\frac{1}{3}) $$\n  $$ W_S = 10{,}000 + 40{,}000 + \\frac{50{,}000}{6} + 10{,}000 = \\frac{205{,}000}{3} \\approx 68{,}333.33 \\text{ hours} $$\n- Next, adjust for the category allowance ($c=0.15$) to get the total required workload hours ($W_T$):\n  $$ W_{T, \\text{WISN}} = W_S \\times (1 + c) = \\frac{205{,}000}{3} \\times 1.15 \\approx 78{,}583.33 \\text{ hours} $$\n- Finally, calculate the required FTE by dividing by the annual available working time per nurse ($T = 1{,}680$ hours):\n  $$ N_{\\text{WISN}} = \\frac{W_{T, \\text{WISN}}}{T} = \\frac{78{,}583.33}{1{,}680} \\approx 46.78 \\text{ FTE} $$\n  This is approximately **47 FTE**.\n\n**b. Population-to-Provider Ratio Model**\nThis model uses the national normative target of 1 nurse per $5{,}000$ population.\n- Required FTE is calculated as:\n  $$ N_{\\text{ratio}} = \\frac{\\text{Population}}{5{,}000} = \\frac{250{,}000}{5{,}000} = 50 \\text{ FTE} $$\n  The requirement is **50 FTE**.\n\n**c. Burden-of-Disease-Based Needs Model**\nThis model replaces the observed NCD workload with a \"needed\" workload based on epidemiology.\n- First, calculate the needed NCD workload hours:\n  - Adult population = $250{,}000 \\times 0.60 = 150{,}000$\n  - Number of NCD patients = $150{,}000 \\times 0.15 = 22{,}500$\n  - Total needed NCD visits = $22{,}500 \\times 4 = 90{,}000$\n  - Needed NCD workload hours = $90{,}000 \\text{ visits} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours/visit} = 30{,}000$ hours.\n- The observed NCD workload was $10,000$ hours. We replace this in the total service workload:\n  $$ W_{S, \\text{BoD}} = (W_S - 10{,}000) + 30{,}000 = (\\frac{205{,}000}{3} - 10{,}000) + 30{,}000 = \\frac{205{,}000}{3} + 20{,}000 \\approx 88{,}333.33 \\text{ hours} $$\n- Adjust for the category allowance:\n  $$ W_{T, \\text{BoD}} = W_{S, \\text{BoD}} \\times 1.15 \\approx 101{,}583.33 \\text{ hours} $$\n- Calculate the required FTE:\n  $$ N_{\\text{BoD}} = \\frac{W_{T, \\text{BoD}}}{T} = \\frac{101{,}583.33}{1{,}680} \\approx 60.47 \\text{ FTE} $$\n  This is approximately **60 FTE**.\n\n**2. Evaluation of Options**\n\n- **Calculated Needs:** WISN $\\approx 47$ FTE, Population Ratio = $50$ FTE, Burden-of-Disease $\\approx 60$ FTE.\n- **Option A:** Correctly states the calculated FTE needs. The qualitative descriptions are accurate: WISN is best for immediate operational planning based on *actual* workload; the population ratio is a simple benchmark tool; and the burden-of-disease model is a strategic tool for medium-term planning to meet *unmet* need.\n- **Option B:** The numerical values are incorrectly assigned. The qualitative descriptions are also incorrect (e.g., claims the population ratio captures workload).\n- **Option C:** Incorrectly claims all methods converge. The qualitative descriptions are flawed.\n- **Option D:** States the correct numbers but provides incorrect qualitative descriptions of the models' use cases (e.g., claims WISN is for long-term planning).\n\nTherefore, Option A is the only one that provides both the correct calculations and the correct conceptual analysis of the models.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4985545"}]}
