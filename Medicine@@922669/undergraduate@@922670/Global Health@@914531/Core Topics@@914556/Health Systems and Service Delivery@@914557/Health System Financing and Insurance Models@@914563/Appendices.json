The derivation proceeds from first principles based on the provided definitions and the condition of expected budget balance.\n\nFirst, we formalize the components of the budget identity.\nThe total expected expenditures, which we shall denote as $E_{total}$, are given as the product of the expected per capita health expenditure, $c$, and the number of covered persons, $N$.\n$$E_{total} = cN$$\nThe total expected revenues, which we shall denote as $R_{total}$, are given as the product of the flat payroll contribution rate, $\\tau$, and the total formal wage base subject to contributions, $W$.\n$$R_{total} = \\tau W$$\nThe problem states that the scheme targets an expected budget balance, which implies that total expected revenues must equal total expected expenditures.\n$$R_{total} = E_{total}$$\nSubstituting the definitions for revenues and expenditures into this identity gives us the core budget equation:\n$$\\tau W = cN$$\nThe problem asks for the payroll contribution rate $\\tau$ that achieves this balance.

The formula for this elasticity is provided as:\n$$E_{W} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\tau}{\\partial W}\\right)\\left(\\frac{W}{\\tau}\\right)$$\nTo compute $E_W$, we first need the partial derivative of $\\tau$ with respect to $W$, denoted $\\frac{\\partial \\tau}{\\partial W}$.

This exercise delves into a classic economic model of adverse selection, allowing you to derive the break-even premium in a mixed-risk pool and mathematically analyze the economic pressures that can trigger a market \"death spiral\" [@problem_id:4983721].", "problem": "Consider a single-payer health insurance market operating under community rating, where a single premium $p$ is charged to all enrollees regardless of risk type.

Among those who enroll, the share of low-risk individuals is $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$ and the share of high-risk individuals is $1-\\alpha$. Assume zero administrative loading and zero profits, and that insurers must satisfy a break-even constraint based on the expected cost of the enrolled pool.\n\nUsing the definitions of actuarial fairness and the break-even constraint (expected revenue equals expected cost in expectation), derive the community-rated break-even premium $p^{\\ast}$ as a function of $\\alpha$, $c_{L}$, and $c_{H}$.

The insurer is assumed to have zero administrative costs and zero profit.\n\nThe expected revenue per enrollee is simply the community-rated premium, $p$.\n\nThe expected cost per enrollee, denoted $E[c]$, is the weighted average of the costs of the two risk types in the enrolled pool. The weights are the respective shares of each type. The share of low-risk individuals is $\\alpha$, and their expected cost is $c_{L}$. The share of high-risk individuals is $1-\\alpha$, and their expected cost is $c_{H}$.\n\nTherefore, the expected cost per enrollee is:\n$$\nE[c] = \\alpha \\cdot c_{L} + (1-\\alpha) \\cdot c_{H}\n$$\n\nThe break-even constraint requires that the premium $p$ be set equal to this expected cost. Let $p^{\\ast}$ denote this break-even premium.\n$$\np^{\\ast} = E[c]\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E[c]$, we obtain the community-rated break-even premium:\n$$\np^{\\ast} = \\alpha c_{L} + (1-\\alpha) c_{H}\n$$\nTo understand the adverse selection pressure on low-risk enrollment, we must analyze how the break-even premium $p^{\\ast}$ changes in response to a change in the composition of the risk pool, specifically the share of low-risk individuals, $\\alpha$. This is accomplished by examining the first derivative of $p^{\\ast}$ with respect to $\\alpha$.\n\nFirst, we express $p^{\\ast}$ as a function of $\\alpha$:\n$$\np^{\\ast}(\\alpha) = \\alpha c_{L} + c_{H} - \\alpha c_{H} = \\alpha (c_{L} - c_{H}) + c_{H}\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the derivative of $p^{\\ast}$ with respect to $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\frac{dp^{\\ast}}{d\\alpha} = \\frac{d}{d\\alpha} \\left[ \\alpha (c_{L} - c_{H}) + c_{H} \\right]\n$$\nSince $c_{L}$ and $c_{H}$ are constants, the derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{dp^{\\ast}}{d\\alpha} = c_{L} - c_{H}\n$$\n\nThe problem states the assumption that $c_{L}  c_{H}$. Based on this premise, the difference $c_{L} - c_{H}$ must be negative.\n$$\nc_{L}  c_{H} \\implies c_{L} - c_{H}  0\n$$\nTherefore, the sign of the derivative is negative:\n$$\n\\frac{dp^{\\ast}}{d\\alpha}  0\n$$\nThe negative sign of the derivative $\\frac{dp^{\\ast}}{d\\alpha}$ indicates that the break-even premium $p^{\\ast}$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $\\alpha$, the share of low-risk individuals in the insurance pool.\n\nThis relationship is the fundamental driver of adverse selection. For any given risk pool with $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$, the premium $p^{\\ast} = \\alpha c_{L} + (1-\\alpha) c_{H}$ is a weighted average of $c_{L}$ and $c_{H}$. Given that $c_{L}  c_{H}$, it follows that $c_{L}  p^{\\ast}  c_{H}$.\n\nThis means the premium is actuarially \"unfair\" from the perspective of low-risk individuals, as they are charged a premium $p^{\\ast}$ that is greater than their expected cost $c_{L}$. Conversely, the premium is a bargain for high-risk individuals, for whom $p^{\\ast}  c_{H}$.\n\nThe adverse selection pressure arises from this pricing structure. Low-risk individuals, observing that $p^{\\ast} > c_{L}$, have an economic incentive to exit the insurance market if their willingness to pay for coverage is less than $p^{\\ast}$. If a subset of these low-risk individuals subsequently disenrolls, the share of low-risk individuals in the remaining pool, $\\alpha$, decreases.\n\nAccording to our derivative, a decrease in $\\alpha$ causes an increase in the break-even premium $p^{\\ast}$. This premium increase makes the insurance plan an even less attractive proposition for the remaining low-risk individuals, as the gap between the premium and their expected cost ($p^{\\ast} - c_{L}$) widens. This creates an incentive for more low-risk individuals to leave the pool.\n\nThis dynamic establishes a positive feedback loop known as an \"adverse selection death spiral\":\n$1$. Low-risk individuals exit $\\implies$ $\\alpha$ decreases.\n$2$. $\\alpha$ decreases $\\implies$ $p^{\\ast}$ increases (since $\\frac{dp^{\\ast}}{d\\alpha}  0$).\n$3$. $p^{\\ast}$ increases $\\implies$ insurance becomes less attractive for remaining low-risk individuals, promoting further exits.\n\nThus, the direction of adverse selection pressure, as revealed by the sign of the derivative, is to drive low-risk individuals out of the community-rated insurance market.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\alpha c_{L} + (1-\\alpha) c_{H}}\n$$", "id": "4983721"}]}
