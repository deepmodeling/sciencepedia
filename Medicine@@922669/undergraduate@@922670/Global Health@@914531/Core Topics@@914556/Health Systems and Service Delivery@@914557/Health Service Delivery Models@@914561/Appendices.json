In this district, nurses are facility-based, while CHWs are field-based and attached operationally to health posts. Under the Ministry’s facility design standards, the maximum staff capacity is as follows: each district hospital can host up to $100$ nurses, each health center can host up to $6$ nurses, and health posts do not host nurses; each health post can host up to $5$ CHWs, while hospitals and health centers do not host CHWs.\n\nUsing the standard definition of a population-based staffing norm, the required staff count for a cadre is the smallest integer $s$ such that $s$ times the per-staff coverage equals or exceeds the population.

Thus, we can conduct the entire analysis on a per-enrollee basis, and the total number of enrollees $N$ is not needed to find $x_{\\max}$.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the baseline surplus per enrollee, $s_0$.\n$$s_0 = R_{cap} - C_{avg,0} = \\$50 - \\$45 = \\$5$$\n\nNext, we decompose the baseline average cost, $C_{avg,0}$, into its fixed and variable components.\nThe fixed component, $C_{fixed}$, is $40\\%$ of the baseline average cost:\n$$C_{fixed} = 0.40 \\times C_{avg,0} = 0.40 \\times \\$45 = \\$18$$\nThe baseline variable component, $C_{var,0}$, is $60\\%$ of the baseline average cost:\n$$C_{var,0} = 0.60 \\times C_{avg,0} = 0.60 \\times \\$45 = \\$27$$\n\nThe preventive program has two effects on the cost per enrollee:\n1. It adds a direct cost of $x$.\n2. It creates savings by reducing the variable cost component by a fraction $\\delta = 0.10$.\n\nThe cost savings per enrollee, let's call it $\\Delta C_{savings}$, are:\n$$\\Delta C_{savings} = \\delta \\times C_{var,0} = 0.10 \\times \\$27 = \\$2.70$$\n\nThe new average cost per enrollee, $C_{avg,1}$, is the sum of the original fixed cost, the new reduced variable cost, and the additional program cost $x$.\n$$C_{avg,1} = C_{fixed} + C_{var,0} \\times (1 - \\delta) + x$$\nAlternatively, the new average cost is the baseline average cost, minus the savings, plus the new cost $x$:\n$$C_{avg,1} = C_{avg,0} - \\Delta C_{savings} + x = \\$45 - \\$2.70 + x = \\$42.30 + x$$\n\nThe new surplus per enrollee, $s_1$, is the capitation revenue minus this new average cost:\n$$s_1 = R_{cap} - C_{avg,1} = R_{cap} - (C_{avg,0} - \\Delta C_{savings} + x)$$\nSubstituting the baseline surplus $s_0 = R_{cap} - C_{avg,0}$:\n$$s_1 = s_0 + \\Delta C_{savings} - x$$\n\nThe problem requires that the new surplus be at least zero:\n$$s_1 \\ge 0$$\n$$s_0 + \\Delta C_{savings} - x \\ge 0$$\n\nSolving this inequality for $x$:\n$$x \\le s_0 + \\Delta C_{savings}$$\nThis establishes the maximum permissible value for $x$, which we denote as $x_{\\max}$.\n$$x_{\\max} = s_0 + \\Delta C_{savings}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the calculated numerical values:\n$$x_{\\max} = \\$5 + \\$2.70$$\n$$x_{\\max} = \\$7.70$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $7.70$ is exact based on the given data. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $7.700$. This value represents the maximum annual cost per enrollee that the clinic can spend on the preventive program while ensuring its net surplus does not fall below zero.\n\nFinal calculation check:\n- New variable cost: $C_{var,1} = C_{var,0} \\times (1 - 0.10) = \\$27 \\times 0.9 = \\$24.30$\n- New total cost without program cost $x$: $C_{fixed} + C_{var,1} = \\$18 + \\$24.30 = \\$42.30$.\n- The \"room\" available for the new program is the difference between revenue and this new cost: $R_{cap} - \\$42.30 = \\$50 - \\$42.30 = \\$7.70$.\n- Therefore, the program cost $x$ can be at most $\\$7.70$.
