The concepts of out-of-pocket expenditure, total consumption, budget share, and catastrophic health spending thresholds are fundamental and well-established metrics used by international organizations such as the World Health Organization and the World Bank. The problem is therefore scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary numerical data ($X$ and $OOP$) and clear definitions for the required calculations. The instructions for rounding and interpretation are unambiguous. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of subjective claims or bias.\n\nThe problem statement does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is complete, consistent, realistic, and formalizable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the out-of-pocket (OOP) health expenditure budget share for a given household. The budget share, let us denote it by $S_{OOP}$, is defined as the fraction of total consumption ($X$) that is allocated to OOP health expenditures ($OOP$).\n\nThe mathematical formulation for the budget share is given by the ratio:\n$$S_{OOP} = \\frac{OOP}{X}$$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n-   Annual total consumption, $X = 3600$ USD.\n-   Annual OOP health expenditures, $OOP = 420$ USD.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula yields:\n$$S_{OOP} = \\frac{420}{3600}$$\n\nTo express this as a decimal, we perform the division:\n$$S_{OOP} = \\frac{42}{360} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{60 \\times 6} = \\frac{7}{60}$$\n$$S_{OOP} = 0.11666...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is the first non-zero digit from the left, which is $1$ in the tenths place. The four significant figures are thus the digits corresponding to $0.1166$. The digit following the fourth significant figure is $6$. Since $6 \\ge 5$, we round up the last significant figure ($6$) to $7$.\n\nTherefore, the OOP budget share rounded to four significant figures is:\n$$S_{OOP} \\approx 0.1167$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to interpret this result. The problem states that catastrophic health spending is flagged when the OOP budget share meets or exceeds $0.10$. The computed share is approximately $0.1167$. We compare this value to the threshold:\n$$0.1167 > 0.10$$\nSince the household's OOP budget share exceeds the $0.10$ threshold, the household is experiencing catastrophic health spending. This level of expenditure is considered to impose a significant financial burden and thus indicates financial vulnerability.\n\nThe final answer requested is the numerical value of the computed OOP budget share only.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1167}$$", "id": "4991717"}, {"introduction": "While identifying catastrophic spending in one household is a vital first step, policymakers need to understand the scale and severity of the problem across a population.
