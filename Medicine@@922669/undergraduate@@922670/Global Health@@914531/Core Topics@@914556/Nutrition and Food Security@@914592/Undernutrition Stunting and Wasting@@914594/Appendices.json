Assume that, for interpretive purposes, these standardized $z$-scores are modeled as draws from a standard normal random variable $Z$ with mean $0$ and variance $1$.

Let $Z$ be a random variable representing the $z$-scores, such that $Z$ follows a standard normal distribution, denoted as $Z \\sim N(\\mu=0, \\sigma^2=1)$. The probability density function (PDF) of $Z$ is $f(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z^2}{2}\\right)$ for $z \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$.\n\nThe percentile rank associated with a given $z$-score is the value of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) at that score. The CDF, denoted by $\\Phi(z)$, gives the probability that the random variable $Z$ is less than or equal to a specific value $z$. It is defined as:\n$$\n\\Phi(z) = P(Z \\le z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{z} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t^2}{2}\\right) dt\n$$\n\n**Part 1: Compute the percentile rank for $z = -1.5$**\n\nWe need to compute the percentile rank for a height-for-age $z$-score of $z=-1.5$. This corresponds to calculating $\\Phi(-1.5)$.\n$$\n\\Phi(-1.5) = P(Z \\le -1.5)\n$$\nThis integral does not have a simple closed-form antiderivative and is typically evaluated numerically or looked up in a standard normal distribution table. Using computational software, the value is found to be:\n$$\n\\Phi(-1.5) \\approx 0.06680720135\n$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is the first non-zero digit from the left, which is $6$. The four significant figures are thus the digits corresponding to $6, 6, 8, 0$. The fifth significant digit is $7$. Since $7 \\ge 5$, we round up the fourth significant digit, which is $0$, to $1$.\nTherefore, the decimal percentile rounded to four significant figures is $0.06681$.\n\n**Part 2: Compute the $z$-score threshold for the $5$th percentile**\n\nWe need to find the $z$-score, let's call it $z_{0.05}$, such that the area under the standard normal curve to its left is equal to $0.05$. This is the $5$th percentile of the standard normal distribution. Mathematically, we need to solve for $z_{0.05}$ in the equation:\n$$\n\\Phi(z_{0.05}) = 0.05\n$$\nThis requires using the inverse of the standard normal CDF, also known as the quantile function, denoted by $\\Phi^{-1}$.\n$$\nz_{0.05} = \\Phi^{-1}(0.05)\n$$\nSince the standard normal distribution is symmetric about $0$ and the requested percentile ($5\\%$) is less than $50\\%$, the corresponding $z$-score will be negative. Using computational software or an inverse normal distribution table, we find the value:\n$$\nz_{0.05} \\approx -1.64485362695\n$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. The significant figures are $1, 6, 4, 4$. The fifth significant digit is $8$. Since $8 \\ge 5$, we round up the fourth significant digit, which is $4$, to $5$.\nTherefore, the $z$-score threshold rounded to four significant figures is $-1.645$.\n\nThe problem asks for the two results in order: first the decimal percentile, then the $z$-score threshold.\nThe final results are $0.06681$ and $-1.645$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.06681  -1.645\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5007021"}, {"introduction": "After identifying undernutrition, a key task in global health is to determine what factors increase a child's risk.

The definitions of Low Birth Weight, stunting, cumulative incidence, and relative risk are standard and correctly applied.

In a cohort study with complete follow-up, the cumulative incidence is a direct measure of risk.\n\nThe risk of stunting in the exposed group ($E^{+}$) is given as:\n$$Risk_{E^{+}} = P(D^{+} | E^{+}) = 0.40$$\n\nThe risk of stunting in the unexposed group ($E^{-}$) is given as:\n$$Risk_{E^{-}} = P(D^{+} | E^{-}) = 0.25$$\n\nRelative risk ($RR$) is defined as the ratio of the risk of the outcome in the exposed group to the risk of the outcome in the unexposed group. The formula for relative risk is:\n$$RR = \\frac{Risk_{E^{+}}}{Risk_{E^{-}}}$$\n\nSubstituting the provided values into the formula:\n$$RR = \\frac{0.40}{0.25}$$\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can express the decimals as fractions or multiply the numerator and denominator by $100$:\n$$RR = \\frac{0.40 \\times 100}{0.25 \\times 100} = \\frac{40}{25}$$\n\nThe fraction $\\frac{40}{25}$ can be reduced by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $5$:\n$$RR = \\frac{40 \\div 5}{25 \\div 5} = \\frac{8}{5}$$\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$RR = 1.6$$\n\nThis result indicates that infants born with LBW have $1.6$ times the risk of being stunted at age $24$ months compared to infants born with normal birth weight, based on the data from this cohort.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.6}$$", "id": "5006998"}, {"introduction": "Community-based screening programs are essential for identifying children with wasting, but the screening tools used are rarely perfect.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n-   Let $D^+$ represent the event that a child has wasting (the disease is present).\n-   Let $D^-$ represent the event that a child does not have wasting.\n-   Let $T^+$ represent the event that the screening test is positive.\n-   Let $T^-$ represent the event that the screening test is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n-   The prevalence of wasting, $P(\\text{prevalence}) = P(D^+) = 0.12$. Consequently, the probability of not having the disease is $P(D^-) = 1 - P(D^+) = 1 - 0.12 = 0.88$.\n-   The sensitivity of the test, $Se = P(T^+ | D^+) = 0.80$. This is the probability of a positive test result given that the child has wasting.\n-   The specificity of the test, $Sp = P(T^- | D^-) = 0.90$. This is the probability of a negative test result given that the child does not have wasting. From this, we can derive the false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test given the child does not have wasting: $P(T^+ | D^-) = 1 - P(T^- | D^-) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n\nThe primary objective is to derive an expression for the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), which is defined as the probability that a child actually has wasting given that their screening test was positive. Symbolically, this is $P(D^+ | T^+)$.\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability (Bayes' theorem):\n$$PPV = P(D^+ | T^+) = \\frac{P(D^+ \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe term in the numerator, $P(D^+ \\cap T^+)$, represents the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive. This is the population of true positives. It can be found by rearranging the definition of sensitivity:\n$$P(D^+ \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | D^+) \\times P(D^+) = Se \\times P(\\text{prevalence})$$\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the overall probability of testing positive. By the law of total probability, a positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios: a true positive (the child has the disease and tests positive) or a false positive (the child does not have the disease but tests positive).\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D^+) + P(T^+ \\cap D^-)$$\nWe have already expressed the first term, $P(T^+ \\cap D^+)$. The second term, $P(T^+ \\cap D^-)$, representing the population of false positives, can be found by rearranging the definition of the false positive rate:\n$$P(T^+ \\cap D^-) = P(T^+ | D^-) \\times P(D^-) = (1 - Sp) \\times (1 - P(\\text{prevalence}))$$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the formula for $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = (Se \\times P(\\text{prevalence})) + ((1 - Sp) \\times (1 - P(\\text{prevalence})))$$\nFinally, by substituting the expressions for the numerator and the denominator into the PPV formula, we derive the general expression for PPV in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\times P(\\text{prevalence})}{(Se \\times P(\\text{prevalence})) + (1 - Sp) \\times (1 - P(\\text{prevalence}))}$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nFor the second part, we compute the numerical value of the PPV for the given setting. Substituting the provided values:\n-   $Se = 0.80$\n-   $Sp = 0.90$\n-   $P(\\text{prevalence}) = 0.12$\n\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.80 \\times 0.12}{(0.80 \\times 0.12) + (1 - 0.90) \\times (1 - 0.12)}$$\nFirst, we calculate the individual components:\n-   The numerator, representing the proportion of true positives in the total population: $0.80 \\times 0.12 = 0.096$.\n-   The first term in the denominator (proportion of true positives): $0.096$.\n-   The second term in the denominator, representing the proportion of false positives in the total population: $(0.10) \\times (0.88) = 0.088$.\nThe denominator, which is the total proportion of positive tests in the population, is the sum of these two terms: $P(T^+) = 0.096 + 0.088 = 0.184$.\n\nNow we can calculate the PPV:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.096}{0.184} \\approx 0.521739...$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we get $PPV = 0.5217$.\n\nFor the third part, we explain the programmatic implications of this result. A PPV of $0.5217$ signifies that among the children identified as positive by the mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) screening, only about $52.17\\%$ are truly wasted according to the gold-standard assessment. Conversely, this means that a substantial proportion, $1 - 0.5217 = 0.4783$ or approximately $48\\%$, of the positive screens are false positives. For a public health program, this finding is critically important. It demonstrates that while the MUAC tape is a useful tool for initial community-level screening to identify a high-risk population, it is not sufficiently accurate to be used as a sole diagnostic for enrollment into a treatment program, such as a supplementary or therapeutic feeding program. A positive screen should not automatically trigger enrollment. Instead, the PPV value reinforces the necessity of a two-stage process: children who screen positive in the community must be referred to a health facility for a confirmatory diagnostic assessment (the \"gold standard\") before they are definitively diagnosed and enrolled for treatment. This workflow ensures that scarce programmatic resources are directed only to those children who genuinely need them, and it prevents the potential harm and stigma of mislabeling a healthy child as malnourished.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5217}$$", "id": "5007044"}]}
