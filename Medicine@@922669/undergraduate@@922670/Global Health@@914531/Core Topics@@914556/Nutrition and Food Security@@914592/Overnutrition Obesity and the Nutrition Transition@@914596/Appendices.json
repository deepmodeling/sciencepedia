It is scientifically sound, self-contained, consistent, and well-posed. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution\nThe primary task is to compute the odds ratio for the association between central obesity and the clustering of other metabolic risk factors.\n\nFirst, we must construct a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table. The exposure is central obesity (WC+ vs. WC-), and the outcome is the presence of at least $2$ of the other four components (which we denote as $k \\geq 2$).\n\nLet $E$ represent the exposure status, where $E=1$ for central obesity (WC+) and $E=0$ for no central obesity (WC-).\nLet $D$ represent the outcome status, where $D=1$ for having $k \\geq 2$ other components and $D=0$ for having $k < 2$ other components.\n\nThe $2 \\times 2$ table is structured as follows:\n- $a$: Number of individuals with $E=1$ and $D=1$ (WC+ and $k \\geq 2$).\n- $b$: Number of individuals with $E=1$ and $D=0$ (WC+ and $k < 2$).\n- $c$: Number of individuals with $E=0$ and $D=1$ (WC- and $k \\geq 2$).\n- $d$: Number of individuals with $E=0$ and $D=0$ (WC- and $k < 2$).\n\nWe populate this table using the provided data.\n\nFor the group with central obesity (WC+), with a total of $22$ women:\n- The number of women with $k \\geq 2$ other components is the sum of counts for $k=2, 3, 4$.\n$$a = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14$$\n- The number of women with $k < 2$ other components is the sum of counts for $k=0, 1$.\n$$b = 2 + 6 = 8$$\nThe sum $a+b = 14+8=22$ matches the group total.\n\nFor the group without central obesity (WC-), with a total of $18$ women:\n- The number of women with $k \\geq 2$ other components is the sum of counts for $k=2, 3, 4$.\n$$c = 3 + 1 + 0 = 4$$\n- The number of women with $k < 2$ other components is the sum of counts for $k=0, 1$.\n$$d = 8 + 6 = 14$$\nThe sum $c+d = 4+14=18$ matches the group total.\n\nThe populated $2 \\times 2$ contingency table is:\n- $a = 14$\n- $b = 8$\n- $c = 4$\n- $d = 14$\n\nThe odds ratio ($OR$) is calculated as the ratio of the odds of the outcome in the exposed group to the odds of the outcome in the unexposed group. The formula is:\n$$OR = \\frac{\\text{odds}(D|E=1)}{\\text{odds}(D|E=0)} = \\frac{a/b}{c/d} = \\frac{ad}{bc}$$\n\nSubstituting the values from our table:\n$$OR = \\frac{(14)(14)}{(8)(4)} = \\frac{196}{32}$$\n\nWe simplify this fraction:\n$$OR = \\frac{196 \\div 4}{32 \\div 4} = \\frac{49}{8}$$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal value:\n$$OR = 6.125$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The number $6.125$ has four significant figures. Rounding to three significant figures, we look at the fourth figure ($5$). Since it is $5$ or greater, we round up the third figure.\n$$OR \\approx 6.13$$\n\nAs a secondary calculation for completeness, we can also determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in the sample. MetS is defined as having $\\geq 3$ of the 5 components.\n- For the WC+ group (who already have one component), individuals with $k \\geq 2$ other components have MetS. The number of such individuals is $8+4+2=14$.\n- For the WC- group, individuals must have $k \\geq 3$ other components to have MetS. The number of such individuals is $1+0=1$.\n- Therefore, the total number of MetS cases is $14 + 1 = 15$. The sample prevalence is $15/40 = 0.375$.\nThis confirms the problem's internal logic but is not the required final answer. The primary calculation of the odds ratio is correct as performed.
