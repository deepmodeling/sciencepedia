This practice will guide you through the essential calculation of total energy intake and the distribution of that energy among the three macronutrients—carbohydrates, proteins, and fats—using the standard Atwater factors.

The diet contains $300$ g carbohydrate, $70$ g protein, and $80$ g fat. Use the foundational Atwater energy factors that carbohydrate provides approximately $4$ kilocalories per gram, protein provides approximately $4$ kilocalories per gram, and fat provides approximately $9$ kilocalories per gram. Use the unit conversion $1$ kilocalorie $=$ $4.184$ kilojoules. The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for adults is defined as follows: carbohydrate share $0.45$ to $0.65$, protein share $0.10$ to $0.35$, and fat share $0.20$ to $0.35$, where each share is the fraction of total energy intake attributable to that macronutrient.\n\nStarting from these facts and definitions, compute:\n1.

The problem is a straightforward application of fundamental principles in nutrition science.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be generated.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first calculating the energy provided by each macronutrient, then the total energy, and finally the shares and compliance indicator.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy contribution from each macronutrient in kilocalories (kcal) using the provided Atwater factors.\nThe energy from carbohydrate, $E_c$, is the product of its mass, $m_c$, and its energy factor, $k_c$.\n$$E_c = m_c \\times k_c = 300 \\, \\text{g} \\times 4 \\, \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{g}} = 1200 \\, \\text{kcal}$$\nThe energy from protein, $E_p$, is the product of its mass, $m_p$, and its energy factor, $k_p$.\n$$E_p = m_p \\times k_p = 70 \\, \\text{g} \\times 4 \\, \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{g}} = 280 \\, \\text{kcal}$$\nThe energy from fat, $E_f$, is the product of its mass, $m_f$, and its energy factor, $k_f$.\n$$E_f = m_f \\times k_f = 80 \\, \\text{g} \\times 9 \\, \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{g}} = 720 \\, \\text{kcal}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total energy intake in kilocalories, $E_{\\text{total, kcal}}$, by summing the energy contributions from each macronutrient.\n$$E_{\\text{total, kcal}} = E_c + E_p + E_f = 1200 \\, \\text{kcal} + 280 \\, \\text{kcal} + 720 \\, \\text{kcal} = 2200 \\, \\text{kcal}$$\n\nThe first required output is the total daily energy intake $E$ in kilojoules (kJ). We convert $E_{\\text{total, kcal}}$ to kilojoules using the given conversion factor.\n$$E = E_{\\text{total, kcal}} \\times 4.184 \\, \\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kcal}} = 2200 \\, \\text{kcal} \\times 4.184 \\, \\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kcal}} = 9204.8 \\, \\text{kJ}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$E = 9205 \\, \\text{kJ}$$\n\nThe second set of required outputs are the energy shares for each macronutrient, defined as the ratio of the macronutrient's energy contribution to the total energy. These ratios are dimensionless and can be calculated using the energy values in kcal.\nThe carbohydrate share, $s_c$, is:\n$$s_c = \\frac{E_c}{E_{\\text{total, kcal}}} = \\frac{1200}{2200} = \\frac{6}{11} \\approx 0.545454...$$\nRounding to four significant figures:\n$$s_c = 0.5455$$\nThe protein share, $s_p$, is:\n$$s_p = \\frac{E_p}{E_{\\text{total, kcal}}} = \\frac{280}{2200} = \\frac{7}{55} \\approx 0.127272...$$\nRounding to four significant figures:\n$$s_p = 0.1273$$\nThe fat share, $s_f$, is:\n$$s_f = \\frac{E_f}{E_{\\text{total, kcal}}} = \\frac{720}{2200} = \\frac{18}{55} \\approx 0.327272...$$\nRounding to four significant figures:\n$$s_f = 0.3273$$\n\nThe final required output is the compliance indicator, $\\mathcal{C}$.

Yes.\n2.  For protein: The AMDR is $[0.10, 0.35]$. Is $0.10 \\le s_p \\le 0.35$? Is $0.10 \\le 0.1273 \\le 0.35$? Yes.\n3.  For fat: The AMDR is $[0.20, 0.35]$. Is $0.20 \\le s_f \\le 0.35$? Is $0.20 \\le 0.3273 \\le 0.35$? Yes.\n\nSince all three shares are within their specified AMDRs, the diet is compliant. Therefore, the compliance indicator $\\mathcal{C}$ is $1$.\n$$\\mathcal{C} = 1$$\n\nThe final answer is the row vector $(E, s_c, s_p, s_f, \\mathcal{C})$ with numerical values rounded to four significant figures where applicable.\nThe calculated values are $E = 9205 \\, \\text{kJ}$, $s_c = 0.5455$, $s_p = 0.1273$, $s_f = 0.3273$, and $\\mathcal{C} = 1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 9205 & 0.5455 & 0.1273 & 0.3273 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4987414"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the assessment of dietary energy intake, we now turn to the other side of the energy balance equation: energy expenditure. This exercise explores how to estimate an individual's Total Energy Expenditure (TEE) from their Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Physical Activity Level (PAL), and how to apply this to a weight management scenario.

Physiologically, as an individual loses weight, their BMR decreases. This occurs for two reasons: a) there is less metabolically active tissue to maintain, and b) the body initiates a process of adaptive thermogenesis, a disproportionate reduction in resting energy expenditure to conserve energy and resist further weight loss. This means the individual’s BMR of $1500 \\text{ kcal/day}$ will not remain constant but will decline as they lose the $5$ kg of mass. Consequently, the TEE will also decrease. With a fixed energy intake of $2040 \\text{ kcal/day}$, the actual daily energy deficit ($TEE - DEI$) will shrink over time, progressively slowing the rate of weight loss. The linear model, by ignoring this feedback, overestimates the speed of weight loss, leading to predictions that are increasingly inaccurate over time. In nutritional epidemiology, this limitation is critical, as it explains why long-term weight loss maintenance is challenging and why initial rapid weight loss often plateaus.\n\n2.  **Changes in the Energy Cost of Physical Activity:** The TEE is calculated as a product of BMR and PAL. The linear model assumes the PAL factor of $1.7$ is constant. However, the energy cost of most physical activities, especially weight-bearing ones like walking or climbing stairs, is proportional to the body mass being moved. As the individual loses weight, less energy is expended to perform the exact same physical tasks. This means that to maintain the same PAL factor, the person would have to increase the duration or intensity of their activities. If their activity pattern remains unchanged, the energy expenditure component of TEE will decrease, further contributing to a reduction in the overall TEE. The model's failure to account for the reduced energy cost of moving a lighter body leads to an overestimation of TEE and, therefore, an overestimation of the daily energy deficit and the rate of weight loss. This is a key consideration in global health programs for counseling patients, as they must understand that maintaining weight loss requires adjustments to either diet or physical activity to counteract these physiological adaptations.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{75.5} $$", "id": "4987443"}, {"introduction": "While total energy is crucial, health also depends on an adequate supply of micronutrients. This problem shifts our focus to iron, a critical mineral, and addresses the common challenge of preventing deficiency in infants, a particularly vulnerable group. You will apply a first-principles mass-balance approach to calculate an infant's \"iron gap\" by accounting for the crucial concept of bioavailability from different food sources, and then devise a practical supplementation strategy to ensure nutritional adequacy [@problem_id:4987424].", "problem": "A public health nutrition team is tasked with planning an iron sufficiency strategy for an average infant aged $6$ to $12$ months in a low-resource setting. The infant is primarily breastfed but is beginning complementary feeding. Use a first-principles mass-balance approach: absorbed nutrient equals ingested nutrient times fractional bioavailability.

Let $A_{diet}$ be the total absorbed iron from the diet. This is the sum of the absorbed iron from each component: $A_{diet} = A_b + A_c + A_h$.\n\nThe absorbed iron from breastmilk, $A_b$, is calculated from the intake volume $V_b = 0.65$ L/day, the iron concentration $C_b = 0.35$ mg/L, and the fractional absorption $f_b = 0.50$.
