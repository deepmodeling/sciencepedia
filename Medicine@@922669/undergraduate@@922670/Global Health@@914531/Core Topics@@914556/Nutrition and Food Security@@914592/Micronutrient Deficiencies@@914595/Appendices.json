The context is universal salt iodization, a well-established public health strategy. The specified values are realistic: iodine fortification levels typically range from $20-40\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$, daily salt intake of $5\\,\\mathrm{g}$ is a common reference value (though actual intake varies), iodine losses of $20\\%$ during cooking and storage are a known factor, and the RNI of $250\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{day}$ for pregnant women is the current recommendation from the World Health Organization. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data for a unique solution. The language is objective and quantitative. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe primary objective is to compute the adequacy ratio, which requires determining the daily amount of iodine delivered from salt consumption.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total mass of iodine ingested per day before accounting for losses. Let this quantity be $I_{\\text{initial}}$. The concentration of iodine in the salt, $C$, is given as $30\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. Using the provided conversion, this is equivalent to $30$ micrograms of iodine per gram of salt.\n$$C = 30\\,\\mathrm{ppm} = 30\\,\\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{g}}$$\nThe daily salt consumption, $M_{\\text{salt}}$, is given as $5\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{day}$. The total daily intake of iodine from salt, before losses, is the product of the concentration and the mass of salt consumed.\n$$I_{\\text{initial}} = C \\times M_{\\text{salt}}$$\n$$I_{\\text{initial}} = \\left(30\\,\\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{g}}\\right) \\times \\left(5\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{day}}\\right) = 150\\,\\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{day}}$$\n\nNext, we account for the loss of iodine. A loss of $L = 20\\%$ means that a fraction of $(1 - \\frac{20}{100}) = 0.80$ of the initial iodine content is retained and delivered to the woman. Let the amount of delivered iodine be $I_{\\text{delivered}}$.\n$$I_{\\text{delivered}} = I_{\\text{initial}} \\times (1 - L)$$\n$$I_{\\text{delivered}} = I_{\\text{initial}} \\times (1 - 0.20) = I_{\\text{initial}} \\times 0.80$$\nSubstituting the value of $I_{\\text{initial}}$:\n$$I_{\\text{delivered}} = \\left(150\\,\\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{day}}\\right) \\times 0.80 = 120\\,\\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{day}}$$\nThis is the daily iodine delivered to the woman from her salt consumption.\n\nThe problem defines the adequacy ratio, let's call it $R_{\\text{adequacy}}$, as the ratio of the delivered iodine to the Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI) for pregnancy. The RNI, $I_{\\text{RNI}}$, is given as $250\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{day}$.\n$$R_{\\text{adequacy}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{delivered}}}{I_{\\text{RNI}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated value for $I_{\\text{delivered}}$ and the given value for $I_{\\text{RNI}}$:\n$$R_{\\text{adequacy}} = \\frac{120\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{day}}{250\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{day}}$$\nThe units $(\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{day})$ cancel, yielding a dimensionless ratio as required.\n$$R_{\\text{adequacy}} = \\frac{120}{250} = \\frac{12}{25} = 0.48$$\n\nThe final step is to express this result as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.\n$$R_{\\text{adequacy}} = 0.480$$\n\nThe primary assumption, as stated in the problem, is that iodine intake from all other dietary sources is ignored.

The derivation and result are mathematically verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that an individual has the disease (true iron deficiency) and $D^c$ be the event that the individual does not have the disease. Let $T$ be the event that the test result is positive and $T^c$ be the event that the test result is negative.\n\nThe givens are defined in probabilistic terms:\n- Prevalence: $p = P(D) = 0.40$. Consequently, the probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$.\n- Sensitivity: $Se = P(T|D)$, the probability of a positive test given disease.\n- Specificity: $Sp = P(T^c|D^c)$, the probability of a negative test given no disease.\n\nA misclassification occurs in one of two mutually exclusive events:\n1.  A false negative (FN), where an individual with the disease tests negative. This event is $T^c \\cap D$.\n2.  A false positive (FP), where an individual without the disease tests positive. This event is $T \\cap D^c$.\n\nThe overall misclassification rate, which we denote as $M$, is the probability of either of these events occurring in the population. By the law of total probability, and since the events are disjoint:\n$$M = P(\\text{misclassification}) = P(T^c \\cap D) + P(T \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can write:\n$$M = P(T^c|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nWe must express $P(T^c|D)$ and $P(T|D^c)$ in terms of sensitivity and specificity.\n- The probability of a negative test given disease, $P(T^c|D)$, is the false negative rate. Since an individual with the disease can only test positive or negative, $P(T|D) + P(T^c|D) = 1$. Thus, $P(T^c|D) = 1 - P(T|D) = 1 - Se$.\n- The probability of a positive test given no disease, $P(T|D^c)$, is the false positive rate. Similarly, for an individual without the disease, $P(T|D^c) + P(T^c|D^c) = 1$. Thus, $P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - Sp$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $M$:\n$$M(p, Se, Sp) = (1 - Se)P(D) + (1 - Sp)P(D^c)$$\n$$M(p, Se, Sp) = (1 - Se)p + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)$$\nThis is the general expression for the overall misclassification rate.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for each screening approach. Let $M_H$ be the misclassification rate for the hemoglobin-alone approach and $M_C$ be the rate for the combined index.\n\nFor the hemoglobin-alone approach:\n$p = 0.40$, $Se_H = 0.57$, $Sp_H = 0.88$.\n$$M_H = (1 - Se_H)p + (1 - Sp_H)(1 - p)$$\n$$M_H = (1 - 0.57)(0.40) + (1 - 0.88)(1 - 0.40)$$\n$$M_H = (0.43)(0.40) + (0.12)(0.60)$$\n$$M_H = 0.172 + 0.072 = 0.244$$\n\nFor the combined index approach:\n$p = 0.40$, $Se_C = 0.83$, $Sp_C = 0.85$.\n$$M_C = (1 - Se_C)p + (1 - Sp_C)(1 - p)$$\n$$M_C = (1 - 0.83)(0.40) + (1 - 0.85)(1 - 0.40)$$\n$$M_C = (0.17)(0.40) + (0.15)(0.60)$$\n$$M_C = 0.068 + 0.090 = 0.158$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the absolute reduction in misclassification rate when switching from hemoglobin alone to the combined index. Let this reduction be $\\Delta M$.\n$$\\Delta M = M_H - M_C$$\n$$\\Delta M = 0.244 - 0.158 = 0.086$$\nThe problem requires this answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first non-zero digit is 8, which is the first significant figure.
