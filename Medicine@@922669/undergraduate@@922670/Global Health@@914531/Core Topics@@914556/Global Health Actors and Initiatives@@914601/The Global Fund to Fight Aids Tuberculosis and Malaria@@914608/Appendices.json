The use of DALYs as a metric and a logarithmic benefit function to model diminishing marginal returns are well-established and scientifically reasonable modeling choices. The problem is firmly grounded in economic theory and its application to public health.\n- **Well-Posed**: The objective function, being a sum of strictly concave functions, is strictly concave. The feasible set, defined by a linear budget constraint and non-negativity constraints, is a compact and convex set (a simplex). The maximization of a strictly concave function over a compact, convex set guarantees the existence of a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise mathematical language and objective definitions, with no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: All necessary parameters, functions, and constraints are provided. The problem is self-contained and free of internal contradictions.\n- **Other criteria**: The problem is formalizable, relevant to the specified field, scientifically plausible, and not trivial. It requires a standard application of Lagrangian optimization.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to maximize the total DALYs averted, $F(x_H, x_T, x_M) = \\sum_{d \\in \\{H,T,M\\}} \\alpha_d \\ln(1 + \\beta_d x_d)$, subject to the budget constraint $\\sum_{d \\in \\{H,T,M\\}} x_d = B$ and non-negativity constraints $x_d \\ge 0$. Since the benefit functions are strictly concave and differentiable, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the optimal allocation.\n\nThe Lagrangian function $\\mathcal{L}$ for this problem is:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(x_H, x_T, x_M, \\lambda) = \\alpha_H \\ln(1 + \\beta_H x_H) + \\alpha_T \\ln(1 + \\beta_T x_T) + \\alpha_M \\ln(1 + \\beta_M x_M) + \\lambda \\left(B - x_H - x_T - x_M\\right) $$\nThe analysis assumes an interior solution where $x_d > 0$ for all $d$, which is consistent with the problem's reference to an \"interior optimum\".\n\n**1. Derivation of the Unconstrained Optimal Allocation**\n\nThe first-order necessary conditions for an interior maximum are obtained by setting the partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to each allocation $x_d$ and the multiplier $\\lambda$ to zero.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x_d} = \\frac{\\alpha_d \\beta_d}{1 + \\beta_d x_d} - \\lambda = 0 \\quad \\text{for } d \\in \\{H, T, M\\} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\lambda} = B - x_H - x_T - x_M = 0 $$\nFrom the first condition, we derive the equalization of marginal benefits, as stated in the problem's base principle:\n$$ \\frac{\\alpha_d \\beta_d}{1 + \\beta_d x_d} = \\lambda $$\nWe can solve for $x_d$ in terms of the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$:\n$$ 1 + \\beta_d x_d = \\frac{\\alpha_d \\beta_d}{\\lambda} \\implies \\beta_d x_d = \\frac{\\alpha_d \\beta_d}{\\lambda} - 1 \\implies x_d = \\frac{\\alpha_d}{\\lambda} - \\frac{1}{\\beta_d} $$\nThis expression represents the optimal allocation $x_d^{\\star}$ for each disease as a function of $\\lambda$. To find $\\lambda$, we substitute this expression into the budget constraint:\n$$ \\sum_{d \\in \\{H,T,M\\}} x_d = \\sum_{d} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha_d}{\\lambda} - \\frac{1}{\\beta_d} \\right) = B $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\sum_{d} \\alpha_d - \\sum_{d} \\frac{1}{\\beta_d} = B $$\nSolving for $\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\lambda} = \\frac{B + \\sum_{d} \\frac{1}{\\beta_d}}{\\sum_{d} \\alpha_d} $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $x_d$ gives the closed-form solution for the unconstrained optimal allocation, which we denote as $x_d^{\\star}$:\n$$ x_d^{\\star} = \\alpha_d \\left( \\frac{B + \\sum_{k \\in \\{H,T,M\\}} \\frac{1}{\\beta_k}}{\\sum_{k \\in \\{H,T,M\\}} \\alpha_k} \\right) - \\frac{1}{\\beta_d} $$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\n**2. Condition for Distortionary Minimum Share and Calculation of $q^{\\star}$**\n\nA minimum portfolio share constraint $x_M \\ge q B$ is \"allocatively distortionary\" if and only if it is binding. A constraint is binding if the unconstrained optimal solution violates it. Therefore, the condition for the constraint to be distortionary is:\n$$ x_M^{\\star} < q B $$\nThe smallest share $q^{\\star}$ at which this minimum share begins to bind is the value of $q$ for which the unconstrained optimum just satisfies the constraint. This threshold $q^{\\star}$ is found by setting the unconstrained allocation equal to the minimum required share:\n$$ x_M^{\\star} = q^{\\star} B $$\nThus, $q^{\\star}$ can be calculated as:\n$$ q^{\\star} = \\frac{x_M^{\\star}}{B} $$\nTo compute the numerical value, we first calculate $x_M^{\\star}$ using the given parameters.\nThe parameters are: $B = 200$, $\\alpha_H = 120$, $\\alpha_T = 100$, $\\alpha_M = 80$, $\\beta_H = 0.015$, $\\beta_T = 0.025$, and $\\beta_M = 0.020$.\n\nFirst, we compute the necessary sums:\n$$ \\sum_{k} \\alpha_k = \\alpha_H + \\alpha_T + \\alpha_M = 120 + 100 + 80 = 300 $$\n$$ \\sum_{k} \\frac{1}{\\beta_k} = \\frac{1}{\\beta_H} + \\frac{1}{\\beta_T} + \\frac{1}{\\beta_M} = \\frac{1}{0.015} + \\frac{1}{0.025} + \\frac{1}{0.020} = \\frac{200}{3} + 40 + 50 = \\frac{200}{3} + 90 = \\frac{200+270}{3} = \\frac{470}{3} $$\nNow we can compute the term $\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\lambda} = \\frac{B + \\sum_{k} \\frac{1}{\\beta_k}}{\\sum_{k} \\alpha_k} = \\frac{200 + \\frac{470}{3}}{300} = \\frac{\\frac{600+470}{3}}{300} = \\frac{1070/3}{300} = \\frac{1070}{900} = \\frac{107}{90} $$\nNow we use this to calculate the unconstrained optimal allocation for malaria, $x_M^{\\star}$:\n$$ x_M^{\\star} = \\alpha_M \\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right) - \\frac{1}{\\beta_M} = 80 \\left(\\frac{107}{90}\\right) - 50 = \\frac{8 \\times 107}{9} - 50 = \\frac{856}{9} - \\frac{450}{9} = \\frac{406}{9} $$\nThe allocations for the other diseases, while not required for the final answer, are $x_H^{\\star} = 120(\\frac{107}{90}) - \\frac{200}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}(107) - \\frac{200}{3} = \\frac{428-200}{3} = \\frac{228}{3}=76$ and $x_T^{\\star} = 100(\\frac{107}{90}) - 40 = \\frac{1070}{9} - \\frac{360}{9} = \\frac{710}{9}$. All allocations are positive, confirming an interior solution.\n\nFinally, we calculate $q^{\\star}$:\n$$ q^{\\star} = \\frac{x_M^{\\star}}{B} = \\frac{406/9}{200} = \\frac{406}{1800} = \\frac{203}{900} $$\nAs a decimal, $q^{\\star} = \\frac{203}{900} \\approx 0.22555...$.\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $q^{\\star} \\approx 0.2256$.\n\n**3. Derivation of the Non-Distortionary Absolute Floor**\n\nFor the alternative constraint, an absolute floor $x_M \\ge E_M$, the logic is analogous to part 2. This constraint does not distort the allocative efficiency as long as the unconstrained optimal solution $x_M^{\\star}$ already satisfies it, i.e., $x_M^{\\star} \\ge E_M$. The largest such floor, $E_M^{\\mathrm{crit}}$, that can be imposed without causing any distortion is therefore equal to the unconstrained optimal allocation for malaria itself.\n$$ E_M^{\\mathrm{crit}} = x_M^{\\star} $$\nSymbolically, this is:\n$$ E_M^{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\alpha_M \\left( \\frac{B + \\sum_{k \\in \\{H,T,M\\}} \\frac{1}{\\beta_k}}{\\sum_{k \\in \\{H,T,M\\}} \\alpha_k} \\right) - \\frac{1}{\\beta_M} $$\nNumerically, this value is $E_M^{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{406}{9} \\approx 45.11$ million United States dollars.\n\nThe question asks for the numerical value of $q^{\\star}$ rounded to four significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2256}$$", "id": "5002499"}, {"introduction": "An optimal funding allocation on paper is only effective if countries can translate those funds into action.

Let $A_{t}$ be the stock available for consumption during month $t$, which is the stock on hand above the buffer stock level.\n$$A_{t} = \\max(0, I_{t} - B_{s})$$\nThe demand satisfied in month $t$, $S_{t}$, is the lesser of the monthly demand $D$ and the available stock $A_{t}$.\n$$S_{t} = \\min(D, A_{t})$$\nThe inventory at the start of month $t+1$ is the level at the start of month $t$, reduced by the satisfied demand $S_{t}$, and increased by any shipments arriving at the end of month $t$. For simplicity, all calculations will use units of $10^{6}$ courses.
