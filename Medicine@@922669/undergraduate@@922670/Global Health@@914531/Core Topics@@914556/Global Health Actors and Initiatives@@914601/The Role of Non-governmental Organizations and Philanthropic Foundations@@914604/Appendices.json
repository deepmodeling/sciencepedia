This phenomenon, known as fungibility, is a central challenge in assessing the true impact of foreign aid. This exercise [@problem_id:5006049] provides a hands-on method to quantify the 'additionality' of a grant, helping you calculate the net increase in total spending after accounting for the portion of the government's budget that is effectively displaced.", "problem": "A large international philanthropic foundation provides an earmarked grant of $50$ million United States dollars to a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) to procure and distribute malaria bed nets in Country X. Prior to the grant, Country X’s Ministry of Health allocates $200$ million United States dollars to malaria programs within its public budget. Empirical public finance studies in the setting indicate that the government budget exhibits $30$ percent fungibility with respect to externally earmarked malaria funds. For the purpose of this problem, adopt the following scientifically realistic assumptions grounded in standard budget accounting:\n\n- Pre-donation malaria spending equals the government’s pre-donation malaria budget allocation, i.e., total malaria spending before the donation equals $B$, where $B$ is the pre-donation malaria budget.\n- The earmarked donation is fully programmatically spent on malaria bed nets within the same fiscal year and would not have occurred absent the donation.\n- Fungibility acts as a linear, proportional crowd-out of the government’s own malaria allocation: for each donor dollar earmarked to malaria, the government reduces its own malaria allocation by a fraction $f$ of that donor dollar and reallocates those freed funds to non-malaria uses; this reduction is capped at the pre-donation malaria budget so that malaria spending never becomes negative. Here, $f$ is the fungibility rate.\n- No other donors or revenue sources change contemporaneously, and there are no binding capacity constraints on malaria program absorption.\n\nUsing core definitions of budget identity and additionality, compute the additionality of the donation, defined as the net increase in total malaria spending attributable to the donation (post-donation malaria spending minus pre-donation malaria spending). Express your final answer as a single number in millions of United States dollars. No rounding is necessary.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of public finance and health economics, well-posed with all necessary data and definitions, and objective in its language. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and solvable.\n\nLet us define the variables based on the information provided:\n- The donation from the philanthropic foundation is $D = 50$ million United States dollars.\n- The government of Country X's pre-donation malaria budget is $B = 200$ million United States dollars.\n- The fungibility rate is $f = 30\\% = 0.3$.\n\nThe goal is to compute the additionality of the donation, $A_{net}$, which is defined as the net increase in total malaria spending.\n$$A_{net} = S_{post} - S_{pre}$$\nwhere $S_{pre}$ is the total pre-donation spending on malaria and $S_{post}$ is the total post-donation spending on malaria.\n\nFirst, we determine the pre-donation total spending, $S_{pre}$. According to the problem statement, \"Pre-donation malaria spending equals the government’s pre-donation malaria budget allocation\". Therefore, only the government is spending on malaria before the donation.\n$$S_{pre} = B = \\$200 \\text{ million}$$\n\nNext, we determine the post-donation total spending, $S_{post}$. This is the sum of the government's new malaria expenditure, $G_{post}$, and the foundation's donation, $D$, which is fully spent on the program.\n$$S_{post} = G_{post} + D$$\n\nTo find $G_{post}$, we must account for fungibility. The problem states that \"for each donor dollar earmarked to malaria, the government reduces its own malaria allocation by a fraction $f$ of that donor dollar\". This reduction is a \"crowd-out\" of government funds. The total amount of the reduction, let's call it $R$, is calculated as:\n$$R = f \\times D$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R = 0.3 \\times \\$50 \\text{ million} = \\$15 \\text{ million}$$\n\nThe problem also specifies a cap on this reduction: \"this reduction is capped at the pre-donation malaria budget so that malaria spending never becomes negative\". The pre-donation budget is $B = \\$200$ million. Since the calculated reduction $R = \\$15$ million is less than $B = \\$200$ million, the cap is not triggered.\n\nThe government's post-donation malaria expenditure, $G_{post}$, is its original budget minus the amount crowded out by the donation.\n$$G_{post} = B - R = B - fD$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$G_{post} = \\$200 \\text{ million} - \\$15 \\text{ million} = \\$185 \\text{ million}$$\n\nNow we can calculate the total post-donation spending, $S_{post}$.\n$$S_{post} = G_{post} + D = (\\$185 \\text{ million}) + (\\$50 \\text{ million}) = \\$235 \\text{ million}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the additionality, $A_{net}$, by finding the difference between post-donation and pre-donation total spending.\n$$A_{net} = S_{post} - S_{pre}$$\n$$A_{net} = \\$235 \\text{ million} - \\$200 \\text{ million} = \\$35 \\text{ million}$$\n\nAlternatively, we can derive a general formula for additionality.\n$$A_{net} = S_{post} - S_{pre}$$\n$$A_{net} = (G_{post} + D) - B$$\nSubstituting $G_{post} = B - fD$:\n$$A_{net} = (B - fD + D) - B$$\nThe pre-donation budget $B$ cancels out:\n$$A_{net} = D - fD = D(1 - f)$$\nThis elegant result shows that the net increase in spending is the total donation amount, $D$, less the portion that was displaced from the government's budget due to fungibility, $fD$.\n\nUsing this general formula with the given values:\n$$D = 50$$\n$$f = 0.3$$\n$$A_{net} = 50 \\times (1 - 0.3) = 50 \\times 0.7 = 35$$\nThe additionality of the donation is $35$ million United States dollars.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{35}$$", "id": "5006049"}, {"introduction": "International NGOs often operate with budgets denominated in a major currency like the U.S. dollar, while their program expenses are in a local currency.

Consider the following scientifically grounded scenario grounded in standard burden of disease accounting. Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and philanthropic foundations commonly assess health impact using Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), where a DALY represents one lost year of healthy life. By definition, total burden in DALYs equals the sum of years of life lost and years lived with disability; the burden attributable to an exposure can be approximated as the product of exposure intensity and a marginal health-impact coefficient.\n\nSuppose the foundation allocates endowment funds of $I = 2.0 \\times 10^{8}$ United States Dollars (USD) to a corporation whose products are associated with increased disease risk.
