A key challenge is that individual countries may lack the incentive to invest sufficiently, as a large portion of the benefits accrue to their neighbors—a classic economic problem known as a positive externality.

[@problem_id:5005649]", "problem": "Consider two neighboring countries indexed by $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$ that choose per-capita infectious disease surveillance intensity $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$, where $x_i = 1$ represents fully funding a recommended surveillance package and $x_i = 0$ represents no funding. The per-capita resource cost borne by the investing country is $c = 5$ dollars. The surveillance generates a purely external per-capita benefit $b = 8$ dollars that accrues to the neighbor (through reduced cross-border outbreak risk), and the investing country’s own direct per-capita benefit from its own surveillance is $0$. Assume identical countries and that per-capita values are additive across countries.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Externality: An action by one country ($x_i$) yields a per-capita benefit $b$ to the other country $j \\neq i$, and no internal per-capita benefit to country $i$.\n- Nash equilibrium in a binary-action game: Each country chooses $x_i$ to maximize its own per-capita payoff given the other’s choice $x_j$.\n- Social planner’s optimum: Choose $(x_1,x_2)$ to maximize the sum of per-capita payoffs across the two countries.\n\nA multilateral organization such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank Group (World Bank), or the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) can offer a uniform per-capita subsidy $s$ to any country that invests ($x_i = 1$).

The subsidized payoff is $U_i^s(x_i, x_j) = U_i(x_i, x_j) + s \\cdot x_i$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is a standard application of game theory to a public goods problem with externalities, a well-established model in economics and public policy analysis. The concepts of Nash equilibrium, social optimum, and corrective subsidies are fundamental to this field. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary parameters ($b$, $c$) and objective functions defined. The premises are logically consistent and do not violate any scientific or mathematical principles. The setup is well-posed and allows for a unique, meaningful solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Proceed with Solution\n\nFirst, we formalize the per-capita payoff function for country $i$ based on its action $x_i$ and its neighbor's action $x_j$ (where $j \\neq i$). The benefit for country $i$ is $b \\cdot x_j$ and its cost is $c \\cdot x_i$.\n$$U_i(x_i, x_j) = b x_j - c x_i$$\nWe are given the values $b=8$ and $c=5$.\n\n**1. The Social Planner’s Optimum, $x^{\\ast}$**\n\nThe social planner's objective is to choose $(x_1, x_2)$ to maximize the total per-capita welfare, $W(x_1, x_2)$, which is the sum of the individual payoffs:\n$$W(x_1, x_2) = U_1(x_1, x_2) + U_2(x_1, x_2) = (b x_2 - c x_1) + (b x_1 - c x_2)$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$W(x_1, x_2) = (b-c)x_1 + (b-c)x_2$$\nSubstituting the given values $b=8$ and $c=5$:\n$$W(x_1, x_2) = (8-5)x_1 + (8-5)x_2 = 3x_1 + 3x_2$$\nTo maximize this welfare function, the planner should choose the largest possible values for $x_1$ and $x_2$. Since the action space for each country is $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, the maximum value for each is $1$.\nThe socially optimal strategy profile is therefore $(x_1, x_2) = (1,1)$.\nThe problem asks for the symmetric per-capita surveillance investment in this optimum, which is $x^{\\ast}$.\n$$x^{\\ast} = 1$$\n\n**2. The Nash Equilibrium without Subsidy, $x^{N}$**\n\nIn a Nash equilibrium, each country chooses its action to maximize its own payoff, given the other country's action. We determine the best response for country $i$ to any choice $x_j$ by country $j$. Country $i$ chooses $x_i$ to maximize $U_i(x_i, x_j) = b x_j - c x_i$.\n\nLet's fix the action of country $j$, $x_j \\in \\{0,1\\}$, and compare the payoffs for country $i$:\n-   If country $i$ chooses to invest ($x_i=1$), its payoff is $U_i(1, x_j) = b x_j - c$.\n-   If country $i$ chooses not to invest ($x_i=0$), its payoff is $U_i(0, x_j) = b x_j - c(0) = b x_j$.\n\nComparing the two possible payoffs for country $i$:\n$$b x_j - c < b x_j$$\nThis inequality holds because $c=5 > 0$. This means that for any action taken by country $j$, country $i$ will always achieve a strictly higher payoff by choosing not to invest ($x_i=0$). Therefore, $x_i=0$ is a strictly dominant strategy.\nSince the game is symmetric, $x_2=0$ is also the dominant strategy for country $2$. The unique Nash equilibrium is the one where both countries play their dominant strategy: $(x_1, x_2) = (0,0)$.\nThe symmetric investment level in the Nash equilibrium is $x^N$.\n$$x^{N} = 0$$\n\n**3. The Minimum Uniform Per-Capita Subsidy, $s^{\\min}$**\n\nA multilateral organization offers a subsidy $s$ to any country that invests. The new payoff function for country $i$, denoted $U_i^s$, becomes:\n$$U_i^s(x_i, x_j) = (b x_j - c x_i) + s x_i = b x_j + (s-c)x_i$$\nWe want to find the minimum subsidy $s$ that makes the socially optimal outcome $(x_1, x_2)=(1,1)$ a Nash equilibrium. For $(1,1)$ to be a Nash equilibrium, neither country must have an incentive to unilaterally deviate. We check the condition for country $i$, assuming country $j$ plays $x_j=1$. Country $i$ must prefer to play $x_i=1$ over deviating to $x_i=0$.\nThe condition is:\n$$U_i^s(1,1) \\geq U_i^s(0,1)$$\nLet's calculate the payoffs:\n-   Payoff for not deviating (playing $x_i=1$): $U_i^s(1,1) = b(1) + (s-c)(1) = b+s-c$.\n-   Payoff for deviating (playing $x_i=0$): $U_i^s(0,1) = b(1) + (s-c)(0) = b$.\n\nSo, the condition becomes:\n$$b+s-c \\geq b$$\n$$s-c \\geq 0$$\n$$s \\geq c$$\nGiven that the cost is $c=5$, the subsidy must satisfy $s \\geq 5$.\nThe minimum subsidy $s^{\\min}$ required is the smallest value that satisfies this condition.\n$$s^{\\min} = 5$$\n\nThe final answer is the row vector $(x^{\\ast}, x^{N}, s^{\\min})$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5005649"}, {"introduction": "Once the need for collective action is established and funds are pooled, a primary function of multilateral partnerships is to allocate these resources in a fair, transparent, and principled manner.

Let $A_i$ be the allocation for country $i$, $N_i$ be its standardized need measure, and $w_i$ be its co-financing multiplier.\n\nThe first principle is proportionality, which states that each country's allocation is proportional to the product of its need and its weight. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$ A_i \\propto w_i N_i $$\nTo convert this proportionality into an equation, we introduce a constant of proportionality, $k$, which is the same for all countries.\n$$ A_i = k \\cdot (w_i N_i) \\quad \\text{for } i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n $$\n\nThe second principle is the fixed budget constraint, which requires that the sum of all individual allocations must equal the total available budget, $B$.\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i = B $$\n\nTo find the specific allocations, we combine these two principles.

Therefore, $P_{BC}$ is strongly dominated and must be removed from consideration.\n\n**Step 2: Eliminate extendedly dominated options.**\nOur remaining set of non-dominated portfolios, ordered by cost, is $\\{P_0, P_B, P_C, P_A\\}$. An option is extendedly dominated if it is less cost-effective than a combination of other options. This is identified by calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for successive pairs of options. The ICER must strictly increase along the efficient expansion path. The ICER between two portfolios $P_i$ and $P_j$ (with $C_j > C_i$) is given by $ICER = \\frac{C_j - C_i}{D_j - D_i}$.\n\nLet's compute the ICERs for the sequence $P_0 \\to P_B \\to P_C \\to P_A$.\n- **ICER for $P_B$ vs $P_0$**:\n$$ICER_{B,0} = \\frac{C_B - C_0}{D_B - D_0} = \\frac{\\text{\\$}30,000 - \\text{\\$}0}{300 - 0} = \\text{\\$}100 \\text{ per DALY}$$\n- **ICER for $P_C$ vs $P_B$**:\n$$ICER_{C,B} = \\frac{C_C - C_B}{D_C - D_B} = \\frac{\\text{\\$}40,000 - \\text{\\$}30,000}{600 - 300} = \\frac{\\text{\\$}10,000}{300} \\approx \\text{\\$}33.33 \\text{ per DALY}$$\nSince $ICER_{C,B} < ICER_{B,0}$, the sequence of ICERs is not increasing. This indicates the presence of extended dominance. Portfolio $P_B$ is extendedly dominated because the move from $P_0$ to $P_C$ is more cost-effective (ICER = $\\frac{\\text{\\$}40,000}{600} \\approx \\text{\\$}66.67$ per DALY) than the move from $P_0$ to $P_B$ (ICER = $\\text{\\$}100$ per DALY). Thus, we eliminate $P_B$.\n\nOur remaining set of portfolios is now $\\{P_0, P_C, P_A\\}$, ordered by cost. Let's re-calculate the ICERs for the new sequence $P_0 \\to P_C \\to P_A$.\n- **ICER for $P_C$ vs $P_0$**:\n$$ICER_{C,0} = \\frac{C_C - C_0}{D_C - D_0} = \\frac{\\text{\\$}40,000 - \\text{\\$}0}{600 - 0} \\approx \\text{\\$}66.67 \\text{ per DALY}$$\n- **ICER for $P_A$ vs $P_C$**:\n$$ICER_{A,C} = \\frac{C_A - C_C}{D_A - D_C} = \\frac{\\text{\\$}50,000 - \\text{\\$}40,000}{1,000 - 600} = \\frac{\\text{\\$}10,000}{400} = \\text{\\$}25 \\text{ per DALY}$$\nAgain, the ICER decreases ($ICER_{A,C} < ICER_{C,0}$). This indicates that $P_C$ is also extendedly dominated. The move from $P_0$ to $P_A$ has an ICER of $\\frac{\\text{\\$}50,000}{1,000} = \\text{\\$}50$ per DALY, which is more cost-effective than the move from $P_0$ to $P_C$ (ICER $\\approx \\text{\\$}66.67$ per DALY). Thus, we eliminate $P_C$.\n\n**Step 3: Construct the final efficient expansion path.**\nAfter eliminating all dominated and extendedly dominated portfolios, the only remaining efficient options are $P_0$ (doing nothing) and $P_A$ (funding only intervention A). The efficient expansion path consists of the sequence $P_0 \\to P_A$.\n\nThis path signifies that for any level of budget, the only efficient choices are to fund nothing (if the budget is less than $\\$50,000$) or to fund portfolio A (if the budget is $\\$50,000$ or more). All other portfolios or combinations represent an inefficient use of resources.\n\n**Step 4: Select the optimal portfolio for the given budget.**\nThe specified budget is $B = \\text{\\$}70,000$. According to the efficient expansion path, since the budget is sufficient to fund portfolio $P_A$ (which costs $C_A = \\text{\\$}50,000$), this is the optimal choice. After funding $P_A$, the remaining budget is $\\$70,000 - \\$50,000 = \\$20,000$, which is insufficient to fund any of the other interventions (B costs $\\$30,000$ and C costs $\\$40,000$).\n\nTherefore, the portfolio that maximizes DALYs averted under the budget constraint, following the principles of incremental cost-effectiveness analysis, is portfolio A. The total DALYs averted by this portfolio is $D_A$.\n\nTotal DALYs averted = $1,000$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1000}$$", "id": "5005682"}]}
