The problem statement provides a clear definition for the ICER: the cost per unit of additional health gained. In this context, the cost is the additional programmatic cost, and the health gain is measured in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) averted.\n\nThe formula for the ICER is given by the ratio of the incremental cost of the intervention to its incremental health effect:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\text{Incremental Cost}}{\\text{Incremental Effect}}\n$$\n\nLet $\\Delta C$ represent the incremental cost per child and $\\Delta E$ represent the incremental health effect per child (in DALYs averted). Based on the givens:\n- The incremental cost is $\\Delta C = \\$10$ per child.\n- The incremental effect is $\\Delta E = 0.02$ DALYs averted per child.\n\nSubstituting these values into the ICER formula:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{\\$10 \\text{ per child}}{0.02 \\text{ DALYs averted per child}}\n$$\n\nThe 'per child' unit in the numerator and denominator cancels, yielding the ratio in units of dollars per DALY averted.\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{10}{0.02} \\frac{\\$}{\\text{DALY}}\n$$\n\nTo compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{10}{\\frac{2}{100}} \\frac{\\$}{\\text{DALY}} = 10 \\times \\frac{100}{2} \\frac{\\$}{\\text{DALY}} = 10 \\times 50 \\frac{\\$}{\\text{DALY}} = 500 \\frac{\\$}{\\text{DALY}}\n$$\n\nThe calculated ICER is $\\$500$ per DALY averted.\n\nThe second part of the task is to determine if the intervention is cost-effective. An intervention is considered cost-effective if its ICER is less than or equal to the established willingness-to-pay or decision threshold.\n- Calculated ICER: $\\$500$ per DALY\n- Decision Threshold: $\\$1,200$ per DALY\n\nComparing the two values:\n$$\n\\$500 \\le \\$1,200\n$$\nSince the calculated ICER is less than the country's decision threshold, the introduction of the new vaccine would be considered a cost-effective intervention under the given assumptions.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be the ICER value rounded to $3$ significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $500$. To represent this with $3$ significant figures, we can express it in scientific notation.\n$$\n500 = 5.00 \\times 10^2\n$$\nThe value $5.00 \\times 10^2$ explicitly denotes three significant figures.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{5.00 \\times 10^{2}}\n$$", "id": "4987929"}, {"introduction": "After deciding on effective interventions, multilateral funders like the Global Fund face the challenge of distributing a finite pool of resources equitably among many countries.

This demonstrates that the specific value of $k$ is not required to determine the normalized shares.\n$$\nS_1 = \\frac{\\frac{b_1}{y_1}}{\\frac{b_1}{y_1} + \\frac{b_2}{y_2}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n-   $b_1 = 200,000$\n-   $y_1 = 1,500$\n-   $b_2 = 50,000$\n-   $y_2 = 4,000$\n\nFirst, we calculate the ratio $\\frac{b}{y}$ for each country.\nFor Country $1$:\n$$\n\\frac{b_1}{y_1} = \\frac{200,000}{1,500} = \\frac{2,000}{15} = \\frac{400}{3}\n$$\nFor Country $2$:\n$$\n\\frac{b_2}{y_2} = \\frac{50,000}{4,000} = \\frac{50}{4} = \\frac{25}{2}\n$$\nNext, we substitute these values back into the expression for $S_1$:\n$$\nS_1 = \\frac{\\frac{400}{3}}{\\frac{400}{3} + \\frac{25}{2}}\n$$\nTo simplify the denominator, we find a common denominator, which is $6$:\n$$\n\\frac{400}{3} + \\frac{25}{2} = \\frac{400 \\times 2}{6} + \\frac{25 \\times 3}{6} = \\frac{800}{6} + \\frac{75}{6} = \\frac{875}{6}\n$$\nNow, the expression for $S_1$ becomes:\n$$\nS_1 = \\frac{\\frac{400}{3}}{\\frac{875}{6}}\n$$\nTo divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal:\n$$\nS_1 = \\frac{400}{3} \\times \\frac{6}{875} = \\frac{400 \\times 2}{875} = \\frac{800}{875}\n$$\nTo simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.
