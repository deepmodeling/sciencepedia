By definition, the dropout proportion between DTP1 and DTP3 is the fraction of children who received DTP1 but did not subsequently receive DTP3, relative to all children who received DTP1.

Despite a similar absolute number of infants not completing as Province Alpha, the higher proportion indicates greater attrition after series initiation, pointing to continuity gaps (for example, appointment adherence, session timing, or stock reliability).\n- Province Gamma: The dropout count is $15{,}500 - 12{,}400 = 3{,}100$, with dropout proportion $\\frac{3{,}100}{15{,}500} = 0.200$. Like Province Beta, this reflects higher proportional attrition among starters, consistent with missed opportunities at subsequent contacts. \n\nProgrammatically, the national dropout of approximately $0.1612$ conceals subnational heterogeneity: Provinces Beta and Gamma show higher proportional loss after initiation. For Missed Opportunities for Vaccination (MOV), the counts $6{,}600$ (Province Beta) and $3{,}100$ (Province Gamma) among starters who did not receive DTP3 flag potential missed opportunities at return visits or other service contacts.
