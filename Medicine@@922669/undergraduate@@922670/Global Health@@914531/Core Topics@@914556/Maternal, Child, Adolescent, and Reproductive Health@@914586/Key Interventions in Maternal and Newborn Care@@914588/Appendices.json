This first practice introduces the concept of a \"readiness score,\" a practical tool used in global health to quantify a facility's capacity. By calculating a score based on the essential components for Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC), you will learn how to systematically evaluate health system preparedness and distinguish between different levels of care [@problem_id:4988235].", "problem": "A district hospital in a low-resource setting is being assessed for its capacity to deliver Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC; Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care). The World Health Organization (WHO; World Health Organization) distinguishes Basic EmONC from Comprehensive EmONC based on the capability to deliver the core basic signal functions and, for Comprehensive EmONC, additional capacity for blood transfusion and cesarean delivery. To quantify structural readiness within Donabedian’s framework, assume a composite readiness index that linearly aggregates binary availability indicators $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for tracer items and capacities using nonnegative weights $w_i$, and is normalized by the total weight across all included components so that the index lies in $[0,1]$.\n\nYou are told that the following components are included in the readiness index with the specified weights: oxytocin availability (weight $3$), parenteral antibiotics (weight $3$), parenteral magnesium sulfate (weight $3$), functional vacuum extractor (weight $2$), functional manual vacuum aspiration (MVA; Manual Vacuum Aspiration) kit for removal of retained products (weight $2$), verified competencies of a Skilled Birth Attendant (SBA; Skilled Birth Attendant) to perform the basic signal functions (weight $4$), capacity for blood transfusion (weight $5$), and a surgical theater with capability for cesarean delivery (weight $5$).\n\nFor the assessed facility, oxytocin, antibiotics, and magnesium sulfate are available; the vacuum extractor and MVA kit are functional; SBA competencies are verified; but blood transfusion capacity and a surgical theater capable of cesarean delivery are absent.\n\nUsing only the definitions above and standard properties of linear aggregation and normalization for composite structural readiness indices, derive and compute the facility’s readiness score as a dimensionless decimal fraction in $[0,1]$. Round your answer to $4$ significant figures. Then, based solely on the implications of the computed readiness and the specified presence or absence of blood transfusion and cesarean capability, state whether the structural profile aligns with Basic EmONC or Comprehensive EmONC classification and why (do not include this interpretation in the final numeric answer).", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in public health methodology, well-posed with a complete and consistent set of data, and objective in its formulation. It presents a standard application of a composite index calculation, which is a formalizable and verifiable task.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of a composite readiness index, which is defined as a normalized linear aggregation of binary availability indicators. Let the readiness index be denoted by $R$. The formula for this index is given by the weighted average of the binary indicators $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, where $x_i=1$ indicates presence and $x_i=0$ indicates absence of a component. The formula is:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i x_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i}\n$$\nwhere $w_i$ are the non-negative weights for each of the $N$ components.\n\nFirst, we list the $N=8$ components, their corresponding weights $w_i$, and their availability status $x_i$ as provided in the problem statement.\n\n1.  Oxytocin availability: weight $w_1 = 3$. Status: available, so $x_1 = 1$.\n2.  Parenteral antibiotics: weight $w_2 = 3$. Status: available, so $x_2 = 1$.\n3.  Parenteral magnesium sulfate: weight $w_3 = 3$. Status: available, so $x_3 = 1$.\n4.  Functional vacuum extractor: weight $w_4 = 2$. Status: functional, so $x_4 = 1$.\n5.  Functional MVA kit: weight $w_5 = 2$. Status: functional, so $x_5 = 1$.\n6.  SBA competencies: weight $w_6 = 4$. Status: verified, so $x_6 = 1$.\n7.  Capacity for blood transfusion: weight $w_7 = 5$. Status: absent, so $x_7 = 0$.\n8.  Surgical theater for cesarean delivery: weight $w_8 = 5$. Status: absent, so $x_8 = 0$.\n\nNext, we calculate the numerator of the index, which is the sum of the products of the weights and their corresponding indicator values, $\\sum_{i=1}^{8} w_i x_i$.\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{8} w_i x_i = (w_1)(x_1) + (w_2)(x_2) + (w_3)(x_3) + (w_4)(x_4) + (w_5)(x_5) + (w_6)(x_6) + (w_7)(x_7) + (w_8)(x_8)\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{8} w_i x_i = (3)(1) + (3)(1) + (3)(1) + (2)(1) + (2)(1) + (4)(1) + (5)(0) + (5)(0)\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{8} w_i x_i = 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 17\n$$\n\nThen, we calculate the denominator, which is the sum of all weights, $\\sum_{i=1}^{8} w_i$. This represents the maximum possible score if all components were present.\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{8} w_i = w_1 + w_2 + w_3 + w_4 + w_5 + w_6 + w_7 + w_8\n$$\nSubstituting the weights:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{8} w_i = 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 27\n$$\n\nNow, we can compute the readiness score $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{8} w_i x_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{8} w_i} = \\frac{17}{27}\n$$\nTo obtain the decimal fraction, we perform the division:\n$$\nR = \\frac{17}{27} \\approx 0.6296296...\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to $4$ significant figures.\n$$\nR \\approx 0.6296\n$$\n\nFor the second part of the question, we must classify the facility's structural profile as Basic or Comprehensive EmONC. According to the definitions provided:\n-   Basic EmONC requires the capability to deliver the core basic signal functions. The problem statement lists the first six components (oxytocin, antibiotics, magnesium sulfate, vacuum extractor, MVA kit, and SBA competencies) as representing these basic functions. The assessed facility has all these components ($x_1=1, x_2=1, x_3=1, x_4=1, x_5=1, x_6=1$).\n-   Comprehensive EmONC requires all basic functions plus the capacity for blood transfusion and cesarean delivery. The assessed facility lacks these two additional capacities ($x_7=0, x_8=0$).\n\nTherefore, based on the specified presence or absence of these capabilities, the facility's structural profile aligns with the definition of **Basic EmONC**. It fulfills all requirements for the basic level but fails to meet the additional requirements for the comprehensive level. The readiness score of approximately $0.63$ reflects that the facility has a majority of the weighted components, but the absence of the high-weight comprehensive components prevents it from achieving a score closer to $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.6296}\n$$", "id": "4988235"}, {"introduction": "Once a system's readiness is established, the next challenge is ensuring interventions reach the population.

It is scientifically grounded in established epidemiological principles, well-posed with a clear objective, and provides all necessary data for a unique and meaningful solution. No contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies are present. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $R_0$ be the risk (probability) of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) in the unexposed group, which are births occurring without Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL). Let $R_1$ be the risk of PPH in the exposed group, which are births with AMTSL.\n\nThe problem states that the baseline incidence of PPH among births without AMTSL is $100$ per $1,000$ births. This gives us the risk $R_0$:\n$$R_0 = \\frac{100}{1000} = 0.1$$\n\nThe relative risk, denoted as $RR$, of PPH with AMTSL compared to without AMTSL is given as $0.65$. The relative risk is defined as the ratio of the risk in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group:\n$$RR = \\frac{R_1}{R_0}$$\nUsing this definition, we can determine the risk in the exposed group, $R_1$:\n$$R_1 = RR \\times R_0 = 0.65 \\times 0.1 = 0.065$$\n\nThe problem considers an increase in AMTSL coverage.

Expressed as proportions, these are:\n$$C_1 = 0.50$$\n$$C_2 = 0.80$$\n\nThe overall population risk, $R_{pop}$, can be calculated using the law of total probability. It is the weighted average of the risks of the subgroups (exposed and unexposed), where the weights are the proportions of the population in each subgroup.
