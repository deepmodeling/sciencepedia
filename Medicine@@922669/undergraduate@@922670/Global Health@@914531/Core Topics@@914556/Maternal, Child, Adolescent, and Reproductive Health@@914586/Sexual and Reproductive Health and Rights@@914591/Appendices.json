This exercise provides practice in calculating the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR), one of the most critical indicators in global health. By standardizing the number of maternal deaths against a constant number of live births, the MMR allows for fair comparisons across time and between different populations, making it an essential tool for tracking progress and identifying where interventions are needed most [@problem_id:4996019].", "problem": "A district health office reports that during a recent calendar year there were $145$ maternal deaths among residents and $215{,}000$ live births in the same year. Use the epidemiological principle that a health ratio standardized to a fixed base allows comparison across populations and time, and the core definition that the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) is the number of maternal deaths during a specified time period per $100{,}000$ live births in the same period. \n\nFrom these foundations, first derive an expression for the Maternal Mortality Ratio in terms of the count of maternal deaths and the number of live births, including the appropriate standardization constant.

Express the final value in the unit “maternal deaths per $100{,}000$ live births.” The final answer must be a single numerical value.", "solution": "The problem statement is valid as it is scientifically grounded in established epidemiological principles, well-posed with all necessary data and definitions, and objective in its phrasing.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR), its computation from given data, and an explanation of its utility for trend analysis.\n\nFirst, we derive the general expression for the Maternal Mortality Ratio. The problem defines MMR as the number of maternal deaths during a specified time period per $100{,}000$ live births in the same period. Let $D_m$ represent the count of maternal deaths and $B_l$ represent the number of live births over the same period. The simple ratio of maternal deaths to live births is given by the fraction $\\frac{D_m}{B_l}$. This fraction represents the number of deaths per single live birth. To standardize this ratio to a base of $100{,}000$ live births, we multiply this fraction by the standardization constant, $k = 100{,}000$.\n\nTherefore, the expression for the Maternal Mortality Ratio is:\n$$\n\\text{MMR} = \\frac{D_m}{B_l} \\times 100{,}000\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the MMR using the reported figures. The problem provides the following data for a specific calendar year:\n- Number of maternal deaths, $D_m = 145$.\n- Number of live births, $B_l = 215{,}000$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\n\\text{MMR} = \\frac{145}{215{,}000} \\times 100{,}000\n$$\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$\n\\text{MMR} = \\left(\\frac{145}{215}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{100{,}000}{1{,}000}\\right) = \\frac{145}{215} \\times 100\n$$\n$$\n\\text{MMR} \\approx 0.6744186 \\times 100 = 67.44186...\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $6$, $7$, $4$, and $4$. The fifth significant figure is $1$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$\n\\text{MMR} \\approx 67.44\n$$\nThe resulting value is expressed in the unit \"maternal deaths per $100{,}000$ live births.\"\n\nFinally, as requested, the reason this standardized ratio supports trend analysis is that by standardizing the number of deaths to a constant denominator ($100{,}000$ live births), the ratio normalizes for changes in the size of the population at risk (i.e., the number of live births) from year to year, thereby allowing for a direct comparison of underlying mortality risk over time.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{67.44}$$", "id": "4996019"}, {"introduction": "Beyond population-level metrics, delivering sexual and reproductive health services requires sound clinical judgment at the individual level.

The physiological risks mentioned (effect of estrogen on blood pressure and ischemic stroke) are well-documented.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined. It provides all necessary clinical data (age, BP, BMI, smoking status, specific type of migraine, specific type of hypertension) to apply the WHO MEC guidelines and arrive at a single, verifiable classification.\n-   **Objective:** The language is clinical and precise, free from ambiguity or subjective interpretation.\n\nThe problem statement has no identifiable flaws. It does not violate scientific principles, is not incomplete or contradictory, is not unrealistic, and is well-structured.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will now be derived from first principles.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe solution requires applying the World Health Organization (WHO) Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) for Contraceptive Use. The core principles are the definitions of the four eligibility categories and the rule for integrating categories when multiple conditions are present.\n\n**WHO MEC Categories:**\n-   **Category $1$**: A condition for which there is no restriction for the use of the contraceptive method.\n-   **Category $2$**: A condition where the advantages of using the method generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks.\n-   **Category $3$**: A condition where the theoretical or proven risks generally outweigh the advantages of using the method. The method is not usually recommended unless other more appropriate methods are not available or acceptable.\n-   **Category $4$**: A condition that represents an unacceptable health risk if the contraceptive method is used.\n\n**Rule for Multiple Conditions:**\nWhen a woman has multiple conditions that affect her eligibility for a contraceptive method, the MEC category for that method should correspond to the **most restrictive category** that applies to any of the individual conditions.\n\nWe must now assess the patient's eligibility for Combined Hormonal Contraception (CHC) based on her individual health conditions.\n\n**1. Assessment of Hypertension:**\nThe patient has chronic hypertension, which is stated to be \"adequately controlled\" on medication, with recent average blood pressure readings of $128/82\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$. According to the WHO MEC for Contraceptive Use (5th Edition, 2015), the classification for CHC use in a woman with **adequately controlled hypertension** is **Category $3$**.\n\n*   **Rationale:** Estrogen, a component of CHC, can increase blood pressure and the risk of cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and stroke. While the risk is lower in women whose hypertension is well-controlled compared to those with uncontrolled hypertension, the baseline risk is still elevated compared to normotensive women. Therefore, the proven risks of CHC are considered to generally outweigh the advantages in this population.\n\n**2. Assessment of Migraine Headaches:**\nThe patient is $29$ years old and experiences migraine **without aura**. The WHO MEC guidelines for CHC differentiate migraine headaches by the presence of aura and by age.\n\n-   Migraine **with** aura (at any age): Category $4$.\n-   Migraine **without** aura (age $< 35$ years): **Category $2$**.\n-   Migraine **without** aura (age $\\ge 35$ years): Category $3$.\n\nThe patient is $29$ years old, so she falls into the \"age $< 35$ years\" group. Her condition is classified as **Category $2$** for CHC use.\n\n*   **Rationale:** Use of CHC is associated with a small increase in the risk of ischemic stroke. This risk is substantially higher in women who have migraine with aura. For women under age $35$ who have migraine without aura, the absolute risk of stroke is considered very low, and the advantages of contraception are generally deemed to outweigh this small theoretical risk.\n\n**3. Assessment of Other Factors:**\n-   **Age:** Age $29$ is not a contraindication (Category $1$).\n-   **BMI:** A BMI of $24\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^2}$ is within the normal range, posing no restriction (Category $1$).\n-   **Smoking Status:** Being a nonsmoker is a favorable factor and does not impose a restriction (Category $1$).\n-   **Nulliparity, No Diabetes, No History of Thromboembolism:** These are all Category $1$.\n\n**4. Integration of Categories:**\nThe patient has two conditions that result in a non-Category $1$ classification for CHC:\n-   Adequately controlled hypertension: **Category $3$**\n-   Migraine without aura (age $< 35$): **Category $2$**\n\nApplying the rule for multiple conditions, we must select the most restrictive category. Comparing Category $3$ and Category $2$, **Category $3$** is the more restrictive classification.\n\nTherefore, the patient's overall eligibility for combined hormonal contraception is **WHO MEC Category $3$**.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Category $1$ (no restriction), because controlled hypertension and migraine without aura confer negligible risk with CHC.**\nThis option is **Incorrect**. The statement that the risks are \"negligible\" is factually wrong according to the WHO MEC. Adequately controlled hypertension is classified as Category $3$, indicating that risks generally outweigh benefits. Migraine without aura in a woman under $35$ is Category $2$, indicating that while advantages outweigh risks, the risks are not negligible. The final classification cannot be Category $1$.\n\n**B. Category $2$ (advantages generally outweigh risks), because migraine without aura under age $35$ is category $2$ for CHC.**\nThis option is **Incorrect**. While it correctly identifies that migraine without aura under age $35$ is a Category $2$ condition, it fails to apply the rule for integrating multiple conditions. The patient also has adequately controlled hypertension, which is a Category $3$ condition. The most restrictive category, Category $3$, must be applied.\n\n**C. Category $3$ (risks generally outweigh advantages), because adequately controlled hypertension is category $3$ for CHC and, with coexisting conditions, the most restrictive applicable category prevails.**\nThis option is **Correct**. It accurately identifies the final eligibility as Category $3$. It correctly attributes this classification to the patient's adequately controlled hypertension (a Category $3$ condition). Furthermore, it correctly states the principle for combining multiple conditions—that the most restrictive category prevails. The reasoning is complete and accurate based on the WHO MEC framework.\n\n**D. Category $4$ (unacceptable health risk), because any migraine is a contraindication to estrogen-containing contraception regardless of aura or age.**\nThis option is **Incorrect**. The justification provided is factually incorrect. The WHO MEC makes a critical distinction between migraine with and without aura. Migraine *with* aura is a Category $4$ contraindication. However, migraine *without* aura is classified as Category $2$ or $3$ depending on age, not an absolute contraindication. The patient has migraine without aura and does not meet the criteria for a Category $4$ classification from either of her conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4996051"}, {"introduction": "In a world of finite resources, deciding which health programs to implement is a critical challenge for ministries of health.

It quantifies the additional cost incurred for each additional unit of health outcome gained when comparing a more intensive intervention (the 'intervention', here Program $\\mathcal{C}$) with a less intensive one (the 'comparator', here Program $\\mathcal{B}$).
