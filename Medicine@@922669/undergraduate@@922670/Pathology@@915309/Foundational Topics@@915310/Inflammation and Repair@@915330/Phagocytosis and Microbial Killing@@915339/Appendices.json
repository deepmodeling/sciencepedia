The Helfrich model is a fundamental and widely-accepted framework for describing the mechanics of lipid membranes. The problem setup, which balances bending energy cost against adhesion energy gain, is a standard and physically sound approach in biophysics to model phenomena like cell adhesion, endocytosis, and phagocytosis.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed.

A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe process of engulfment is governed by the change in the total free energy of the system, $\\Delta E$. This change is the sum of the energy cost associated with bending the membrane, $E_{\\text{bend}}$, and the energy gain from adhesion between the membrane and the particle, $E_{\\text{ad}}$. Complete engulfment is energetically favorable if the total energy change is less than or equal to zero, i.e., $\\Delta E \\le 0$.\n\nThe Helfrich bending energy per unit area, or energy density, is given by $\\mathcal{E}_{\\text{bend}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa(2H - C_0)^2 + \\bar{\\kappa}K$, where $H$ is the mean curvature, $K$ is the Gaussian curvature, $C_0$ is the spontaneous curvature, $\\kappa$ is the bending modulus, and $\\bar{\\kappa}$ is the Gaussian curvature modulus. The problem specifies to ignore spontaneous curvature, so we set $C_0 = 0$. In this simplified model, we consider only the contribution from the mean curvature, as is standard practice for such problems and as implied by the problem statement focusing on $H$. The initial state of the membrane is flat, where $H=0$, so its initial bending energy is $E_{\\text{initial}} = 0$. For the final state, the membrane is wrapped into a sphere of radius $R$.\n\nThe mean curvature of a sphere of radius $R$ is constant over its surface and is given by $H = \\frac{1}{R}$. The bending energy density becomes $\\mathcal{E}_{\\text{bend}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa(2H)^2 = 2\\kappa H^2$.\n\nThe total bending energy cost, $E_{\\text{bend}}$, is the integral of this energy density over the entire surface area of the spherical particle, $A = 4\\pi R^2$.\n$$ E_{\\text{bend}} = \\int_A \\mathcal{E}_{\\text{bend}} \\, dA $$\nSince $\\kappa$ and $H$ are constant over the surface of the sphere:\n$$ E_{\\text{bend}} = (2\\kappa H^2) A = 2\\kappa \\left(\\frac{1}{R}\\right)^2 (4\\pi R^2) = \\frac{2\\kappa}{R^2} (4\\pi R^2) = 8\\pi\\kappa $$\nThis is the total energy cost required to bend a flat membrane into a closed spherical shell of radius $R$.\n\nThe adhesion energy, $E_{\\text{ad}}$, is gained from the binding of the membrane to the particle surface. This is an energetically favorable process, so the energy change is negative. For a uniform adhesion energy density $w$, the total adhesion energy gained upon complete wrapping over the area $A$ is:\n$$ E_{\\text{ad}} = -wA = -w(4\\pi R^2) $$\n\nThe total energy change for complete engulfment is the sum of the bending cost and adhesion gain:\n$$ \\Delta E = E_{\\text{bend}} + E_{\\text{ad}} = 8\\pi\\kappa - 4\\pi w R^2 $$\nComplete engulfment will occur spontaneously if $\\Delta E \\le 0$. This gives the energy-balance criterion:\n$$ 8\\pi\\kappa - 4\\pi w R^2 \\le 0 $$\n$$ 8\\pi\\kappa \\le 4\\pi w R^2 $$\nSolving for $w$, we find the condition on the adhesion energy density:\n$$ w \\ge \\frac{8\\pi\\kappa}{4\\pi R^2} = \\frac{2\\kappa}{R^2} $$\nThe minimum adhesion energy density required for complete wrapping, $w_{\\text{th}}$, corresponds to the equality in the criterion, where the energy gain just balances the bending cost:\n$$ w_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{2\\kappa}{R^2} $$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for $w_{\\text{th}}$.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided values.\nFirst, we calculate the bending modulus $\\kappa$ in SI units (Joules):\n$$ \\kappa = 20 \\, k_B T = 20 \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (310\\,\\text{K}) $$\n$$ \\kappa = 8.5599838 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\text{J} $$\nThe radius of the particle is $R = 1\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}$.\nNow we can calculate $w_{\\text{th}}$:\n$$ w_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{2\\kappa}{R^2} = \\frac{2 \\times (8.5599838 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\text{J})}{(1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m})^2} $$\n$$ w_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{1.71199676 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{J}}{1 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{m}^2} $$\n$$ w_{\\text{th}} = 1.71199676 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{m}^{-2} $$\nRounding this result to four significant figures, as required by the problem statement:\n$$ w_{\\text{th}} \\approx 1.712 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{m}^{-2} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.712 \\times 10^{-7}}$$", "id": "4431608"}, {"introduction": "Once a microbe is enclosed within a phagosome, the cell initiates a potent chemical assault known as the respiratory burst.

It also asks for a biological interpretation regarding microbial killing.

Superoxide itself is a reactive oxygen species (ROS) with modest microbicidal activity. However, it is rapidly converted, either spontaneously or by the enzyme superoxide dismutase, into hydrogen peroxide ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}_2$). In the phagosome, the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) uses $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}_2$ and chloride ions ($\\text{Cl}^-$) to generate hypochlorous acid ($\\text{HOCl}$), a highly potent microbicidal agent. Furthermore, superoxide can react with other molecules to form additional destructive species like the hydroxyl radical ($\\cdot\\text{OH}$) and peroxynitrite ($\\text{ONOO}^-$).\n\nThe calculated result shows a substantial decrease in the rate of superoxide generation to about $21\\%$ of the rate under higher oxygen conditions. Since superoxide is the primary substrate for the entire cascade of potent microbicidal ROS, a sharp reduction in its production will severely compromise the cell's ability to generate sufficient levels of $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}_2$, $\\text{HOCl}$, and other ROS. This impairment of the oxidative burst directly translates to a significant decrease in the microbial killing efficiency of the neutrophil.

We can separate the variables $N$ and $t$ by rearranging the terms:\n$$ \\frac{1}{N} dN = -k \\, dt $$\nTo find the relationship between the number of viable bacteria $N(t)$ at any time $t$ and the initial number $N_{0}$ at $t=0$, we integrate both sides of the equation. We integrate the left side with respect to $N$ from $N_{0}$ to $N(t)$ and the right side with respect to $t$ from $0$ to $t$.\n$$ \\int_{N_{0}}^{N(t)} \\frac{1}{N'} dN' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, dt' $$\nThe integrals are evaluated as follows:\n$$ [\\ln(N')]_{N_{0}}^{N(t)} = [-kt']_{0}^{t} $$\n$$ \\ln(N(t)) - \\ln(N_{0}) = (-kt) - (-k \\cdot 0) $$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, we combine the terms on the left side:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_{0}}\\right) = -kt $$\nThis equation describes the exponential decay of the bacterial population. To derive the expression for the rate constant $k$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$ k = -\\frac{1}{t} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_{0}}\\right) $$\nAlternatively, using the property $-\\ln(x) = \\ln(1/x)$, the expression for $k$ can be written without the negative sign:\n$$ k = \\frac{1}{t} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{0}}{N(t)}\\right) $$\nThis is the desired expression for the killing rate constant $k$ in terms of the initial count $N_{0}$, the count at time $t$, $N(t)$, and the time $t$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Value of $k$**\n\nWe use the derived expression and substitute the given values:\n-   $t = 60\\,\\text{min}$\n-   $N_{0} = 10^{6}$\n-   $N(60) = 10^{4}$\n\nThe ratio of initial to final counts is:\n$$ \\frac{N_{0}}{N(60)} = \\frac{10^{6}}{10^{4}} = 10^{2} = 100 $$\nNow, we substitute this ratio and the time $t$ into the expression for $k$:\n$$ k = \\frac{1}{60\\,\\text{min}} \\ln(100) $$\nTo find the numerical value, we use the natural logarithm of $100$: $\\ln(100) \\approx 4.6051701859...$\n$$ k \\approx \\frac{4.6051701859}{60} \\,\\text{min}^{-1} $$\n$$ k \\approx 0.0767528364 \\,\\text{min}^{-1} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as requested:\n$$ k \\approx 0.07675 \\,\\text{min}^{-1} $$\n\n**Part 3: Qualitative Assessment of Variability**\n\nThe problem asks to assess the impact of a coefficient of variation ($CV$) of $0.2$ on CFU measurements. The $CV$ is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, $CV = \\sigma_{N}/N$. The key to this assessment lies in the logarithmic transformation inherent to first-order kinetics.\n\nThe integrated rate law is $\\ln(N(t)) = \\ln(N_{0}) - kt$. This equation implies that a plot of $\\ln(N)$ versus $t$ should yield a straight line with a slope of $-k$ and a y-intercept of $\\ln(N_{0})$. This linearization is central to analyzing kinetic data.\n\nWe can analyze how measurement error in $N$ propagates to the error in $\\ln(N)$. Using the first-order approximation for error propagation, the variance of a function $f(x)$ is given by $\\sigma_{f}^{2} \\approx (\\frac{df}{dx})^{2} \\sigma_{x}^{2}$. For the function $f(N) = \\ln(N)$, the derivative is $\\frac{d}{dN}(\\ln N) = \\frac{1}{N}$.\nThe variance in $\\ln(N)$ is therefore:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\ln(N)}^{2} \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right)^{2} \\sigma_{N}^{2} = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{N}}{N}\\right)^{2} $$\nTaking the square root gives the standard deviation of $\\ln(N)$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\ln(N)} \\approx \\frac{\\sigma_{N}}{N} = \\text{CV}_N $$\nThis result is crucial: a constant coefficient of variation in the measurement $N$ translates to a constant absolute standard deviation in the transformed variable $\\ln(N)$. The given $CV$ of $0.2$ thus implies that the standard deviation of each log-transformed data point is approximately constant, $\\sigma_{\\ln(N)} \\approx 0.2$. This property (homoscedasticity) is highly desirable for linear regression analysis.\n\nThe \"signal\" in this experiment is the change in the log-transformed counts:\n$$ \\Delta(\\ln N) = \\ln(N_{0}) - \\ln(N(60)) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{0}}{N(60)}\\right) = \\ln(100) \\approx 4.605 $$\nThe \"noise\" associated with each measurement is $\\sigma_{\\ln(N)} \\approx 0.2$. The signal strength, $\\Delta(\\ln N) \\approx 4.605$, is more than $20$ times larger than the noise level of a single measurement, $\\sigma_{\\ln(N)} \\approx 0.2$. The uncertainty in the slope, which is determined by the difference of two noisy measurements, is also small relative to the total change. Even with only two time points, the large drop in microbial count ensures that the underlying linear trend in the log-plot would be clearly discernible despite the measurement noise.\n\nTherefore, the variability with a $CV$ of $0.2$ is not likely to materially alter the mechanistic inference of first-order killing. The signal-to-noise ratio in the log-transformed data is very high, making the model robust to this level of experimental error.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.07675}$$", "id": "4431654"}]}
