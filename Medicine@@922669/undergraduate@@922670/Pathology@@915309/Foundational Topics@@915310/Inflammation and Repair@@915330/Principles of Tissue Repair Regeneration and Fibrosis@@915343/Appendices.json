The two wounds differ only in geometry and intention type. Wound A is a clean, sutured linear incision healing by primary intention; after suturing, the opposing epithelial fronts are separated by a uniform gap of width $g$. Wound B is an unsutured circular defect of initial radius $r_{0}$ healing by secondary intention.\n\nUse the following foundational modeling assumptions rooted in core definitions of rates and well-tested kinetic laws in tissue repair:\n1. Epithelial migration is modeled as a constant per-front crawl speed $s$ relative to the stationary dermal bed. For a linear gap with two opposing fronts, the gap width $W(t)$ obeys $dW/dt=-2s$ until closure. For a circular wound, the epithelial edge advances radially inward at speed $s$, contributing $dr/dt=-s$.\n2. Myofibroblast-mediated wound contraction in secondary intention produces an inward radial velocity proportional to the current radius, consistent with a first-order linear law for geometrically self-similar contraction. Specifically, the contraction contribution to radial velocity is $-k\\,r(t)$, where $k$ is a constant with units of inverse time.\n3. Over the time to re-epithelial closure, $s$ and $k$ remain constant, and other processes (inflammation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and proliferation) do not alter these effective rates.\n\nLet Wound A have gap $g=0.5$ mm and Wound B have initial radius $r_{0}=5$ mm. Let the per-front epithelial migration speed be $s=0.05$ mm/h and the contraction coefficient be $k=0.02$ h$^{-1}$. Define $t_{1}$ as the time to closure for Wound A and $t_{2}$ as the time to closure for Wound B.

It is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. I shall therefore proceed with a formal derivation of the solution.\n\nThe objective is to determine the ratio of closure times, $R = t_2 / t_1$, for two wounds healing by different mechanisms. We will first derive an expression for the closure time of each wound, $t_1$ and $t_2$, based on the provided kinetic laws.\n\n**Analysis of Wound A: Primary Intention Healing**\n\nWound A is a linear incision with an initial gap width $W(0) = g$. Healing is dominated by epithelial migration from two opposing fronts. According to Assumption 1, the rate of change of the gap width, $W(t)$, is given by the ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dW}{dt} = -2s $$\nHere, $s$ is the constant migration speed of a single epithelial front. The factor of $2$ accounts for the two fronts moving toward each other. This is a separable first-order differential equation. We can solve for the closure time $t_1$ by integrating from the initial state at $t=0$ to the final state at $t=t_1$, where the gap is closed, i.e., $W(t_1)=0$.\n\n$$ \\int_{W(0)}^{W(t_1)} dW = \\int_{0}^{t_1} -2s \\, dt $$\n$$ W(t_1) - W(0) = -2s (t_1 - 0) $$\nSubstituting the initial condition $W(0) = g$ and the closure condition $W(t_1) = 0$:\n$$ 0 - g = -2s t_1 $$\nSolving for the closure time $t_1$ yields:\n$$ t_1 = \\frac{g}{2s} $$\n\n**Analysis of Wound B: Secondary Intention Healing**\n\nWound B is a circular defect with an initial radius $r(0) = r_0$. Its closure involves two simultaneous processes: epithelial migration advancing radially inward and myofibroblast-mediated contraction of the wound area. The total rate of change of the radius, $dr/dt$, is the sum of the contributions from each process.\n\nAccording to Assumption 1, the contribution from epithelial migration is a constant inward speed, which decreases the radius at a rate of $-s$.\nAccording to Assumption 2, the contribution from wound contraction is proportional to the current radius, given by $-k r(t)$.\n\nCombining these two contributions, the governing differential equation for the radius $r(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dr}{dt} = -s - k r(t) $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can rearrange it into the standard form $y' + P(t)y = Q(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dr}{dt} + k r(t) = -s $$\nThis equation can be solved using the method of integrating factors. The integrating factor, $I(t)$, is given by $I(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int k \\, dt\\right) = \\exp(kt)$.

The steady-state collagen content $C_{\\text{ss}}$ is given by:\n$$ C_{\\text{ss}} = \\frac{\\text{Synthesis Rate}}{\\text{Degradation Rate Constant}} = \\frac{k_{s} \\, A_{\\text{effective}}(T_{\\mathrm{free}})}{k_{d}} $$\nOur goal is to find the value of the effective signaling output, $A_{\\text{effective}}(T_{\\mathrm{free}})$, under the specified therapeutic conditions.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the free TGF-$\\beta$ concentration ($T_{\\mathrm{free}}$)**\n\nThe neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) binds to TGF-$\\beta$ (T), reducing the concentration of free, active TGF-$\\beta$. The binding reaction is $\\text{T} + \\text{Ab} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{T:Ab}$. At equilibrium, the concentrations are related by the dissociation constant $K_{d}^{(\\mathrm{Ab})}$:\n$$ K_{d}^{(\\mathrm{Ab})} = \\frac{[T_{\\mathrm{free}}] [\\text{Ab}_{\\mathrm{free}}]}{[\\text{T:Ab}]} $$\nWe use mass conservation for the total TGF-$\\beta$ ($T_{\\mathrm{tot}}$) and total antibody ($A_{\\mathrm{tot}}$):\n1.  $T_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [T_{\\mathrm{free}}] + [\\text{T:Ab}]$\n2.  $A_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [\\text{Ab}_{\\mathrm{free}}] + [\\text{T:Ab}]$\n\nFrom (1), we express the complex concentration: $[\\text{T:Ab}] = T_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [T_{\\mathrm{free}}]$.\nFrom (2), we express the free antibody concentration: $[\\text{Ab}_{\\mathrm{free}}] = A_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [\\text{T:Ab}] = A_{\\mathrm{tot}} - (T_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [T_{\\mathrm{free}}])$.\n\nLet $x = [T_{\\mathrm{free}}]$. Substituting into the equilibrium equation:\n$$ K_{d}^{(\\mathrm{Ab})} = \\frac{x \\cdot (A_{\\mathrm{tot}} - T_{\\mathrm{tot}} + x)}{T_{\\mathrm{tot}} - x} $$\nNow, we plug in the given values: $T_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 4 \\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $A_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 3 \\,\\mathrm{nM}$, and $K_{d}^{(\\mathrm{Ab})} = 1 \\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n$$ 1 = \\frac{x \\cdot (3 - 4 + x)}{4 - x} $$\n$$ 1 = \\frac{x(x - 1)}{4 - x} $$\n$$ 4 - x = x^2 - x $$\n$$ x^2 = 4 $$\nSince concentration must be positive, we have $x = [T_{\\mathrm{free}}] = 2 \\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the effective signaling output ($A_{\\text{effective}}$)**\n\nThe ALK5 kinase inhibitor acts noncompetitively. This means it reduces the maximum possible signaling output, $A_{\\max}$, without changing the $EC_{50}$. The effective maximum output is given by:\n$$ A_{\\max, \\text{eff}} = \\frac{A_{\\max}}{1 + I/K_{i}} $$\nThe signaling function becomes:\n$$ A_{\\text{effective}}(T_{\\mathrm{free}}) = A_{\\max, \\text{eff}} \\cdot \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{free}}^{n}}{EC_{50}^{n} + T_{\\mathrm{free}}^{n}} = \\left(\\frac{A_{\\max}}{1 + I/K_{i}}\\right) \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{free}}^{n}}{EC_{50}^{n} + T_{\\mathrm{free}}^{n}} $$\nWe are given $I = 50 \\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and $K_{i} = 50 \\,\\mathrm{nM}$, so the inhibitory term is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{1 + I/K_{i}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 50/50} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nNow, we use our calculated $T_{\\mathrm{free}} = 2 \\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and the given parameters $A_{\\max}=1$, $n=2$, and $EC_{50}=2 \\,\\mathrm{nM}$:\n$$ A_{\\text{effective}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\frac{(2)^{2}}{(2)^{2} + (2)^{2}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{4 + 4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25 $$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the steady-state collagen content ($C_{\\text{ss}}$)**\n\nFinally, we substitute the effective signaling output into the steady-state equation, using $k_s = 10 \\,\\mathrm{mg/(g \\cdot day)}$ and $k_d = 0.20 \\,\\mathrm{day^{-1}}$:\n$$ C_{\\text{ss}} = \\frac{k_{s}}{k_{d}} A_{\\text{effective}} = \\frac{10}{0.20} \\times 0.25 $$\n$$ C_{\\text{ss}} = 50 \\times 0.25 = 12.5 \\, \\mathrm{mg/g} $$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ C_{\\text{ss}} = 12.50 \\, \\mathrm{mg/g} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12.50}$$", "id": "4438129"}]}
