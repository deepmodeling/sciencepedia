Consider two otherwise similar patients whose arterial blood is supplying a healing wound. Assume that tissue oxygen delivery is proportional to arterial oxygen content, which is the sum of oxygen bound to hemoglobin and oxygen dissolved in plasma. Use the following well-tested biophysical facts: each gram of hemoglobin binds approximately $1.34$ mL of oxygen when fully saturated, and the solubility of oxygen in blood plasma is approximately $0.0031$ mL $\\mathrm{O_2}$ per dL blood per mmHg of oxygen partial pressure (Henry’s law).

This exercise focuses on the critical role of Vitamin C (ascorbate) in the synthesis of stable collagen, the primary structural protein of the scar. You will explore the biochemical basis for why scurvy impairs wound healing and calculate the direct impact of this deficiency on the molecular composition of collagen [@problem_id:4368373].", "problem": "A wound healing deficit is observed in a patient with severe vitamin C deficiency. Collagen maturation requires hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues by prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase, enzymes that use ferrous iron and L-ascorbate (vitamin C) to enable oxygen-dependent hydroxylation during procollagen synthesis. In normal tissue, the hydroxyproline fraction of mature collagen (defined as the fraction of collagen amino acid residues that are hydroxyproline) is $0.13$. In the deficiency state, the catalytic activity of these hydroxylases is experimentally found to be reduced to $0.30$ of normal. Assume that, under these conditions, hydroxyproline formation is the rate-limiting step for hydroxyproline content and that the hydroxyproline fraction scales linearly with hydroxylase activity, with all other steps non-limiting.\n\nUsing these assumptions and starting from core biochemical principles of enzyme cofactor function, justify why vitamin C deficiency impairs hydroxylase activity and compute the new hydroxyproline fraction of collagen. Express your final answer as a dimensionless decimal fraction. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established biochemical principles regarding enzyme cofactors and collagen synthesis. The provided data and assumptions are sufficient and consistent, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part response: first, a justification for the impairment of hydroxylase activity by vitamin C deficiency, and second, a calculation of the new hydroxyproline fraction.\n\n**Part 1: Justification of Impaired Hydroxylase Activity**\n\nThe synthesis of mature, stable collagen is critically dependent on the post-translational modification of procollagen, a precursor polypeptide. Specifically, certain proline and lysine residues within the procollagen chains must be hydroxylated to form hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine, respectively. These hydroxylated residues are essential for the formation of hydrogen bonds that stabilize the collagen triple helix structure.\n\nThis hydroxylation is catalyzed by the enzymes prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase. These enzymes belong to a class of non-heme iron-containing dioxygenases. The catalytic cycle proceeds as follows:\n1. The active site of the enzyme contains an iron atom in its ferrous state ($Fe^{2+}$).\n2. The $Fe^{2+}$ ion binds the primary substrate (a proline or lysine residue on the procollagen chain), molecular oxygen ($O_2$), and a co-substrate, $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate.\n3. In a complex reaction, one oxygen atom is incorporated into the substrate to form the hydroxyl group (-OH), while the other oxygen atom is incorporated into the co-substrate, converting $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate to succinate and releasing carbon dioxide ($CO_2$).\n4. During this process, the active site iron is oxidized from the ferrous ($Fe^{2+}$) state to the ferric ($Fe^{3+}$) state. The enzyme in this $Fe^{3+}$ state is catalytically inactive.\n\nFor the enzyme to perform another round of catalysis, the iron atom must be reduced back to its active $Fe^{2+}$ state. This is the essential role of L-ascorbate (vitamin C). Ascorbate acts as a reducing agent, donating an electron to the ferric ion, thereby regenerating the active $Fe^{2+}$-containing enzyme.\n\nIn a state of severe vitamin C deficiency, there is an insufficient supply of ascorbate to efficiently reduce the $Fe^{3+}$ back to $Fe^{2+}$. Consequently, a significant fraction of the hydroxylase enzyme molecules becomes \"trapped\" in the inactive ferric state. This reduces the concentration of active enzyme available for catalysis, leading to a marked decrease in the overall rate of proline and lysine hydroxylation. This biochemical mechanism directly explains why vitamin C deficiency impairs hydroxylase activity and, consequently, wound healing.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the New Hydroxyproline Fraction**\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- The normal hydroxyproline fraction of mature collagen is $H_{normal} = 0.13$.\n- In the deficiency state, hydroxylase activity is reduced to $0.30$ of normal. Let $A_{normal}$ and $A_{deficient}$ represent the normal and deficient activities, respectively. Then, $A_{deficient} = 0.30 \\times A_{normal}$.\n- The hydroxyproline fraction, $H$, is assumed to scale linearly with hydroxylase activity, $A$.\n\nThe linear scaling relationship can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$H = k \\cdot A$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality. This relationship holds for both the normal and deficient states.\n\nFor the normal state:\n$$H_{normal} = k \\cdot A_{normal}$$\n\nFor the deficient state:\n$$H_{deficient} = k \\cdot A_{deficient}$$\n\nTo find the new hydroxyproline fraction, $H_{deficient}$, we can set up a ratio of the two states, which conveniently eliminates the unknown constant $k$:\n$$\\frac{H_{deficient}}{H_{normal}} = \\frac{k \\cdot A_{deficient}}{k \\cdot A_{normal}} = \\frac{A_{deficient}}{A_{normal}}$$\n\nWe are given that $A_{deficient} = 0.30 \\times A_{normal}$. Substituting this into the ratio gives:\n$$\\frac{H_{deficient}}{H_{normal}} = \\frac{0.30 \\times A_{normal}}{A_{normal}} = 0.30$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $H_{deficient}$ by multiplying the normal fraction by this reduction factor:\n$$H_{deficient} = 0.30 \\times H_{normal}$$\n\nSubstituting the given value for $H_{normal}$:\n$$H_{deficient} = 0.30 \\times 0.13$$\n$$H_{deficient} = 0.039$$\n\nThus, the new hydroxyproline fraction of collagen in the vitamin C deficiency state, under the given assumptions, is $0.039$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.039}$$", "id": "4368373"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice integrates the concepts of oxygen availability and enzymatic function into a dynamic model of repair.
