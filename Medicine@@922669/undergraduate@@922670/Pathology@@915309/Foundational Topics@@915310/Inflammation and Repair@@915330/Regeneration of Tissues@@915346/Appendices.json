A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the time required for a circular wound to close completely. The closure is driven by the inward radial movement of the wound edge. Let $r(t)$ be the radius of the wound at time $t$. The initial radius at $t=0$ is $r_0$. The initial diameter is given as $d_0 = 1\\,\\text{cm}$, so the initial radius is:\n$$r_0 = \\frac{d_0}{2} = \\frac{1\\,\\text{cm}}{2} = 0.5\\,\\text{cm}$$\n\nThe problem states that the resultant front speed, which we will denote as $v$, is the sum of the migration speed ($v_{mig}$) and the proliferative expansion speed ($v_{pro}$).\n$$v = v_{mig} + v_{pro}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$v = 40\\,\\frac{\\mu\\text{m}}{\\text{h}} + 15\\,\\frac{\\mu\\text{m}}{\\text{h}} = 55\\,\\frac{\\mu\\text{m}}{\\text{h}}$$\nThis speed $v$ represents the constant rate at which the radius of the wound decreases.\n\nTo solve the problem, all quantities must be in a consistent set of units. We are given the speed in micrometers per hour ($\\mu\\text{m/h}$) and the initial radius in centimeters ($\\text{cm}$). We will convert the initial radius to micrometers.\nWe know that $1\\,\\text{cm} = 10^4\\,\\mu\\text{m}$. Therefore, the initial radius $r_0$ in micrometers is:\n$$r_0 = 0.5\\,\\text{cm} \\times \\frac{10^4\\,\\mu\\text{m}}{1\\,\\text{cm}} = 5000\\,\\mu\\text{m}$$\n\nThe rate of change of the radius with respect to time, $\\frac{dr}{dt}$, is the negative of the inward speed $v$, because the radius is decreasing.\n$$\\frac{dr}{dt} = -v$$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation with a constant rate.

It describes a classic reaction-diffusion scenario, which is a fundamental concept in biotransport phenomena and tissue engineering. The governing physics and biological context are sound, and the provided data are consistent.\n\nThe problem asks for the steady-state oxygen concentration profile in a semi-infinite slab of cartilage, the characteristic penetration depth, and a numerical calculation of this depth.\n\nThe governing equation is the one-dimensional diffusion-reaction form of Fick's second law. Let $C(x,t)$ be the oxygen concentration at position $x$ and time $t$. The equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} - R\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $R$ is the rate of consumption. The problem states that oxygen consumption follows first-order kinetics, so the reaction term is $R = kC$, where $k$ is the first-order rate constant. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} - kC\n$$\nAt steady-state, the concentration no longer changes with time, so $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = 0$. This simplifies the partial differential equation to a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\nD \\frac{d^2 C}{dx^2} - kC = 0\n$$\nRearranging the equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 C}{dx^2} - \\frac{k}{D} C = 0\n$$\nThis is a homogeneous linear second-order ODE with constant coefficients.

The general solution is therefore:\n$$\nC(x) = A_{1} \\exp\\left(x\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right) + A_{2} \\exp\\left(-x\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ are constants determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe boundary conditions for a semi-infinite slab occupying $x \\geq 0$ are:\n1. At the synovial surface, $x=0$, the concentration is maintained at a constant value, which we denote as $C_0$. So, $C(0) = C_0$.\n2.

For the concentration $C(x)$ to remain finite, its coefficient $A_{1}$ must be zero.\n$$\nA_{1} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting $A_{1} = 0$ into the equation from the first boundary condition gives $A_{2} = C_0$.\n\nThus, the steady-state concentration profile $C(x)$ is:\n$$\nC(x) = C_0 \\exp\\left(-x\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)\n$$\n\nNext, we identify the characteristic penetration depth $\\lambda$.

The penetration depth $\\lambda$ represents the characteristic distance over which oxygen can diffuse into the tissue before it is substantially consumed by the chondrocytes. Chondrocyte viability is critically dependent on an adequate oxygen supply. In a thick cartilage construct, cells located at a depth significantly greater than $\\lambda$ (e.g., $x > 3\\lambda$) will experience extremely low oxygen levels (hypoxia or anoxia) because the oxygen diffusing from the surface is consumed by the cells in the more superficial layers. This lack of oxygen leads to metabolic stress, reduced matrix production, and ultimately cell death (necrosis).
