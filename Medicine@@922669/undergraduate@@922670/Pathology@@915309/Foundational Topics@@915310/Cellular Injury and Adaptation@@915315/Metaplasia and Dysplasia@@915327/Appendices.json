The process involves several steps, beginning with the calculation of sample means from the observed data, followed by standardization of these means against provided normal reference values, weighting these standardized scores, and finally combining them into a single composite score.\n\nFirst, we calculate the sample means for the two features: atypical mitoses per high-power field (HPF) and the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N:C) ratio.\n\nThe observed data for atypical mitoses per HPF across $10$ fields are: $[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]$.\nThe number of observations is $N = 10$.\nThe sample mean for atypical mitoses, denoted as $\\bar{x}_m$, is the sum of the observations divided by the number of observations:\n$$\n\\bar{x}_m = \\frac{0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1}{10} = \\frac{5}{10} = 0.50\n$$\n\nThe observed data for the N:C ratio across the same $10$ HPFs are: $[0.64, 0.68, 0.66, 0.69, 0.65, 0.67, 0.70, 0.66, 0.68, 0.67]$.\nThe sample mean for the N:C ratio, denoted as $\\bar{x}_n$, is calculated similarly:\n$$\n\\bar{x}_n = \\frac{0.64 + 0.68 + 0.66 + 0.69 + 0.65 + 0.67 + 0.70 + 0.66 + 0.68 + 0.67}{10} = \\frac{6.70}{10} = 0.67\n$$\n\nNext, we standardize the deviation of these sample means from their respective normal reference means. The problem defines \"standardizing feature deviations from normal\". A direct interpretation is to calculate the deviation of the sample mean ($\\bar{x}$) from the population mean ($\\mu$) and divide by the population standard deviation ($\\sigma$). This quantity represents the deviation in units of population standard deviation.\n\nFor atypical mitoses, the standardized deviation, $z_m$, is calculated using the normal reference mean $\\mu_m = 0.10$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_m = 0.20$:\n$$\nz_m = \\frac{\\bar{x}_m - \\mu_m}{\\sigma_m} = \\frac{0.50 - 0.10}{0.20} = \\frac{0.40}{0.20} = 2.0\n$$\n\nFor the N:C ratio, the standardized deviation, $z_n$, is calculated using the normal reference mean $\\mu_n = 0.50$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_n = 0.08$:\n$$\nz_n = \\frac{\\bar{x}_n - \\mu_n}{\\sigma_n} = \\frac{0.67 - 0.50}{0.08} = \\frac{0.17}{0.08} = 2.125\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the composite dysplasia score, $S$, is the magnitude of a two-feature deviation vector, where the components are the weighted standardized deviations. The weighting factors are given as $\\gamma_m = 1.20$ for atypical mitoses and $\\gamma_n = 1.00$ for the N:C ratio.\n\nThe components of the deviation vector are $c_m = \\gamma_m z_m$ and $c_n = \\gamma_n z_n$.\n$$\nc_m = 1.20 \\times 2.0 = 2.40\n$$\n$$\nc_n = 1.00 \\times 2.125 = 2.125\n$$\n\nThe composite score $S$ is the Euclidean magnitude of the vector $(c_m, c_n)$:\n$$\nS = \\sqrt{c_m^2 + c_n^2} = \\sqrt{(2.40)^2 + (2.125)^2}\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $S$:\n$$\nS = \\sqrt{5.76 + 4.515625} = \\sqrt{10.275625}\n$$\n$$\nS \\approx 3.20556158...\n$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the composite score $S$ to four significant figures.\n$$\nS \\approx 3.206\n$$\n\nFinally, we determine the dysplasia grade using the calculated score $S$.

For each marker, a total of $N$ epithelial cells are scored by intensity on a $0$ to $3$ ordinal scale, where $0$ indicates no staining and $3$ indicates strong staining. Assume $N$ is the same for each marker and equals $N = 200$.\n\nUse the standard Histochemical score (H-score) definition: the H-score for a marker is the sum over intensity categories of the intensity multiplied by the percentage of cells at that intensity, that is, if $P_{i}$ is the percentage of cells staining at intensity $i \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$ (with $\\sum_{i=0}^{3} P_{i} = 100$), then the H-score is $\\sum_{i=0}^{3} i \\times P_{i}$.\n\nThe raw counts of cells at each intensity for this case are:\n- MUC2: $0$: $0$ cells, $1$: $60$ cells, $2$: $60$ cells, $3$: $80$ cells.\n- CDX2: $0$: $10$ cells, $1$: $70$ cells, $2$: $50$ cells, $3$: $70$ cells.\n- MUC5AC: $0$: $60$ cells, $1$: $40$ cells, $2$: $40$ cells, $3$: $60$ cells.\n- MUC6: $0$: $110$ cells, $1$: $30$ cells, $2$: $30$ cells, $3$: $30$ cells.\n\nFrom first principles, construct a quantitative mucin subtype index $S$ that contrasts the intestinal phenotype (represented by the pair of intestinal markers MUC2 and CDX2) against the gastric phenotype (represented by the pair of gastric markers MUC5AC and MUC6) under the following constraints grounded in biological interpretation and measurement invariances:\n1. $S$ depends only on the aggregated intestinal signal $I$ and aggregated gastric signal $G$ formed from the H-scores of their respective marker sets.\n2. $S$ is bounded between $-1$ and $+1$; $S=+1$ corresponds to a purely intestinal phenotype ($G=0$, $I>0$), $S=-1$ corresponds to a purely gastric phenotype ($I=0$, $G>0$), and $S=0$ corresponds to equal aggregated signals ($I=G>0$).\n3. $S$ is invariant under common positive rescaling of $I$ and $G$ (that is, replacing $(I,G)$ by $(\\alpha I,\\alpha G)$ for any $\\alpha>0$ leaves $S$ unchanged).\n4. $S$ changes sign upon exchanging the roles of intestinal and gastric aggregates (that is, swapping $I$ and $G$ multiplies $S$ by $-1$).\n5. $S$ is a continuous, strictly increasing function of the ratio $I/G$ for $G>0$.\n\nUsing these constraints, derive an explicit analytic expression for $S$ in terms of $I$ and $G$, compute $S$ for the data above, and (in your reasoning only) decide whether the mucin profile is more consistent with intestinal metaplasia, gastric-type metaplasia, or a mixed pattern using the following rule-of-thumb: $S > 0.2$ indicates intestinal metaplasia, $S < -0.2$ indicates gastric-type metaplasia, and values between $-0.2$ and $0.2$ indicate a mixed pattern.\n\nReport only the numerical value of the computed index $S$ as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.

The H-score is defined as $H = \\sum_{i=0}^{3} i \\times P_{i}$, where $P_{i}$ is the percentage of cells staining at intensity $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. The total number of cells scored for each marker is $N = 200$. The percentage $P_{i}$ can be expressed in terms of the raw cell count $n_{i}$ at intensity $i$ as $P_{i} = \\frac{n_{i}}{N} \\times 100$.\n\nSubstituting this into the H-score formula:\n$$ H = \\sum_{i=0}^{3} i \\left( \\frac{n_{i}}{N} \\times 100 \\right) = \\frac{100}{N} \\sum_{i=0}^{3} i \\cdot n_{i} $$\nGiven $N = 200$, the pre-factor is $\\frac{100}{200} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the formula simplifies to:\n$$ H = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=0}^{3} i \\cdot n_{i} $$\n\nUsing the provided raw cell counts, we calculate the H-score for each marker:\n\n1.  **MUC2 (Intestinal marker):**\n    Counts are $n_{0}=0$, $n_{1}=60$, $n_{2}=60$, $n_{3}=80$.\n    $$ H_{\\text{MUC2}} = \\frac{1}{2} (0 \\times 0 + 1 \\times 60 + 2 \\times 60 + 3 \\times 80) = \\frac{1}{2} (0 + 60 + 120 + 240) = \\frac{1}{2} (420) = 210 $$\n\n2.  **CDX2 (Intestinal marker):**\n    Counts are $n_{0}=10$, $n_{1}=70$, $n_{2}=50$, $n_{3}=70$.\n    $$ H_{\\text{CDX2}} = \\frac{1}{2} (0 \\times 10 + 1 \\times 70 + 2 \\times 50 + 3 \\times 70) = \\frac{1}{2} (0 + 70 + 100 + 210) = \\frac{1}{2} (380) = 190 $$\n\n3.  **MUC5AC (Gastric marker):**\n    Counts are $n_{0}=60$, $n_{1}=40$, $n_{2}=40$, $n_{3}=60$.\n    $$ H_{\\text{MUC5AC}} = \\frac{1}{2} (0 \\times 60 + 1 \\times 40 + 2 \\times 40 + 3 \\times 60) = \\frac{1}{2} (0 + 40 + 80 + 180) = \\frac{1}{2} (300) = 150 $$\n\n4.  **MUC6 (Gastric marker):**\n    Counts are $n_{0}=110$, $n_{1}=30$, $n_{2}=30$, $n_{3}=30$.\n    $$ H_{\\text{MUC6}} = \\frac{1}{2} (0 \\times 110 + 1 \\times 30 + 2 \\times 30 + 3 \\times 30) = \\frac{1}{2} (0 + 30 + 60 + 90) = \\frac{1}{2} (180) = 90 $$\n\nNext, we aggregate these scores into a total intestinal signal $I$ and a total gastric signal $G$. As the problem asks to construct the index from first principles without specifying the aggregation method, we choose summation as the most direct and simple approach.\n$$ I = H_{\\text{MUC2}} + H_{\\text{CDX2}} = 210 + 190 = 400 $$\n$$ G = H_{\\text{MUC5AC}} + H_{\\text{MUC6}} = 150 + 90 = 240 $$\n\nNow we derive the analytic expression for the mucin subtype index $S$ in terms of $I$ and $G$ using the five given constraints.\n1.  $S$ depends only on $I$ and $G$.\n2.  $-1 \\le S \\le +1$. $S(I>0, G=0) = +1$, $S(I=0, G>0) = -1$, and $S(I=G>0) = 0$.\n3.  $S(\\alpha I, \\alpha G) = S(I, G)$ for any $\\alpha > 0$.\n4.  $S(I, G) = -S(G, I)$.\n5.  $S$ is a continuous, strictly increasing function of the ratio $I/G$ (for $G>0$).\n\nConstraint 3 (scale invariance) implies that $S$ must be a function of the ratio of its arguments. Let $S(I,G) = f(I/G)$. Let $r = I/G$.\n\nWe translate the other constraints into properties of $f(r)$:\n- From constraint 2:\n  - $S(I>0, G=0)$ corresponds to $r \\to \\infty$, so $\\lim_{r\\to\\infty} f(r) = 1$.\n  - $S(I=0, G>0)$ corresponds to $r = 0$, so $f(0) = -1$.\n  - $S(I=G>0)$ corresponds to $r = 1$, so $f(1) = 0$.\n- From constraint 4: $S(I,G) = -S(G,I)$ implies $f(I/G) = -f(G/I)$, or $f(r) = -f(1/r)$.\n- From constraint 5: $f(r)$ is continuous and strictly increasing for $r>0$.\n\nWe seek the simplest functional form satisfying these conditions. A rational function is a prime candidate. Let's try to construct such a function. The condition $f(1)=0$ suggests a factor of $(r-1)$ in the numerator. The condition $f(0)=-1$ suggests a simple form like $f(r) = \\frac{r-1}{g(r)}$ with $g(0)=1$. The condition $\\lim_{r\\to\\infty} f(r) = 1$ suggests that the numerator and denominator have the same degree in $r$. A simple choice fulfilling these is $f(r) = \\frac{r-1}{r+1}$.\n\nLet's verify this function against all constraints:\n- $S(I,G) = f(I/G) = \\frac{I/G-1}{I/G+1} = \\frac{I-G}{I+G}$. This depends only on $I$ and $G$. (Constraint 1)\n- For $I, G \\ge 0$, if $I > G$, $S>0$. If $I < G$, $S<0$. The maximum value occurs as $G/I \\to 0$ (i.e., $G=0, I>0$), giving $S=1$. The minimum occurs as $I/G \\to 0$ (i.e., $I=0, G>0$), giving $S=-1$. If $I=G$, $S=0$. The range is $[-1, 1]$. (Constraint 2)\n- $S(\\alpha I, \\alpha G) = \\frac{\\alpha I - \\alpha G}{\\alpha I + \\alpha G} = \\frac{\\alpha(I-G)}{\\alpha(I+G)} = \\frac{I-G}{I+G} = S(I,G)$. (Constraint 3)\n- $S(G,I) = \\frac{G-I}{G+I} = -\\frac{I-G}{I+G} = -S(I,G)$. (Constraint 4)\n- The derivative of $f(r) = \\frac{r-1}{r+1}$ is $f'(r) = \\frac{(1)(r+1) - (r-1)(1)}{(r+1)^2} = \\frac{2}{(r+1)^2}$. For $r=I/G > 0$, $f'(r)>0$, so the function is strictly increasing. It is also continuous for $r \\ge 0$. (Constraint 5)\n\nThe function $S(I,G) = \\frac{I-G}{I+G}$ uniquely satisfies all the required properties in the simplest possible form and is the derived analytic expression for the index.\n\nFinally, we compute the value of $S$ for this case using $I=400$ and $G=240$:\n$$ S = \\frac{400 - 240}{400 + 240} = \\frac{160}{640} = \\frac{16}{64} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25 $$\n\nThe problem asks for a numerical answer rounded to four significant figures, which is $0.2500$.\n\nFor reasoning purposes, we use the interpretation rule provided.

The provided definitions for metaplasia, dysplasia, and the functions of the specified immunohistochemical markers (CDX2, SOX2, MUC2, MUC5AC, Ki-67, p53, CK7/20, AMACR) are all consistent with established principles in molecular pathology and gastroenterology.

It asks for the immunophenotypic pattern that *most specifically supports* a diagnosis of low-grade dysplasia arising within intestinal metaplasia, distinguishing it from reactive atypia. This is a clear, answerable question based on the provided definitions and established diagnostic criteria in pathology. A unique, best answer can be determined from the provided options.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language. It is free of subjectivity or opinion.\n-   **Completeness**: The problem provides sufficient context and definitions to evaluate the options. The \"foundational facts\" section explicitly defines how to interpret the key markers (p53 and Ki-67) for the purpose of this problem.\n-   **Other Flaws**: The problem does not exhibit any other flaws such as being non-formalizable, incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, or outside scientific verifiability.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe task is to identify the set of immunohistochemical findings that most specifically supports a diagnosis of low-grade dysplasia superimposed on intestinal metaplasia, as opposed to simple reactive atypia within intestinal metaplasia.\n\nFirst, we must establish the baseline immunophenotype for the background condition, which is intestinal metaplasia in the esophagus (Barrett's esophagus). Based on the provided definitions:\n-   Intestinal differentiation is driven by the transcription factor CDX2.\n-   Intestinal goblet cells express MUC2.\n-   Therefore, intestinal metaplasia should be characterized by the expression of CDX2 and MUC2.\n-   In a non-dysplastic state, even with reactive changes, proliferation should be orderly. The definition provided states that Ki-67 staining should be confined to the basal crypts.\n-   Without an underlying mutation, the tumor suppressor p53 should exhibit a \"wild-type\" pattern, defined as scattered, weak-to-moderate staining.\n\nNext, we must identify the features that indicate progression to dysplasia. Based on the provided definitions:\n-   Dysplasia involves \"disordered growth.\" This is reflected by \"expansion of the Ki-67 compartment beyond basal crypts to the surface.\"\n-   Dysplasia is often associated with genetic alterations. An underlying mutation in the *TP53* gene is a common early event. This is reflected by an \"aberrant\" p53 immunohistochemical pattern, defined as \"diffuse strong overexpression or complete absence.\"\n\nThe correct option must combine the features of the background intestinal metaplasia with the specific features of dysplasia.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Diffuse nuclear CDX2 and cytoplasmic MUC2 expression in goblet cells; absent SOX2; Ki-67 confined to basal crypts; scattered weak p53 nuclear staining.**\n-   `Diffuse nuclear CDX2 and cytoplasmic MUC2 expression in goblet cells; absent SOX2`: This pattern is the definitive signature of an established intestinal metaplasia phenotype, as per the given definitions.\n-   `Ki-67 confined to basal crypts`: This indicates normal, ordered proliferation restricted to the regenerative compartment. The problem explicitly states this is characteristic of a non-dysplastic state.\n-   `scattered weak p53 nuclear staining`: This is the defined \"wild-type\" pattern, which is explicitly stated as being \"not specific for dysplasia.\"\n-   **Verdict**: This option describes uncomplicated intestinal metaplasia, possibly with minor reactive changes. It lacks any specific markers of dysplasia. **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Diffuse nuclear CDX2 with retained MUC2 in goblet cells; Ki-67 compartment expanded into the upper two-thirds and involving the surface epithelium in atypical glands; p53 showing an aberrant pattern (either diffuse strong overexpression or complete absence) in the same atypical focus.**\n-   `Diffuse nuclear CDX2 with retained MUC2 in goblet cells`: This confirms the process is occurring within a background of intestinal metaplasia.\n-   `Ki-67 compartment expanded into the upper two-thirds and involving the surface epithelium in atypical glands`: This is the hallmark of disordered proliferation and, by the provided definition, \"indicates disordered proliferation typical of dysplasia.\"\n-   `p53 showing an aberrant pattern (either diffuse strong overexpression or complete absence) in the same atypical focus`: This indicates an underlying *TP53* gene mutation, which, according to the provided information, \"support[s] dysplasia.\"\n-   **Verdict**: This option perfectly combines the background phenotype of intestinal metaplasia with the two most specific immunohistochemical markers for dysplasia given in the problem statement: disordered proliferation (expanded Ki-67) and genetic instability (aberrant p53). This pattern is highly specific for low-grade dysplasia arising in intestinal metaplasia. **Correct**.\n\n**C. Loss of CDX2 and MUC2 with strong SOX2 and MUC5AC expression; Ki-67 confined basally; p53 with a scattered wild-type pattern.**\n-   `Loss of CDX2 and MUC2 with strong SOX2 and MUC5AC expression`: This represents a shift away from an intestinal phenotype towards a gastric/foregut phenotype. While phenotypic shifts can occur in dysplasia, the question asks for dysplasia arising *within* intestinalized epithelium. More importantly, the other markers are inconsistent with dysplasia.\n-   `Ki-67 confined basally`: This is a pattern of normal proliferation, arguing against dysplasia.\n-   `p53 with a scattered wild-type pattern`: This is non-specific and does not support dysplasia.\n-   **Verdict**: This option describes a non-intestinal phenotype and lacks any features supportive of dysplasia. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Diffuse co-expression of CK7 and CK20 across the mucosa; Ki-67 limited to basal glands; patchy AMACR positivity; p53 with a wild-type pattern.**\n-   `Diffuse co-expression of CK7 and CK20 across the mucosa`: This cytokeratin pattern is typical for Barrett's metaplasia but, as the problem states, is \"not, in isolation, specific for dysplasia.\"\n-   `patchy AMACR positivity`: The problem also states that AMACR is not specific for dysplasia.\n-   `Ki-67 limited to basal glands`: This argues against dysplasia.\n-   `p53 with a wild-type pattern`: This argues against dysplasia.\n-   **Verdict**: This option relies on non-specific markers and presents Ki-67 and p53 patterns that are inconsistent with a diagnosis of dysplasia. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4406232"}]}
