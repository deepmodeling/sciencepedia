To determine this, we must first calculate the total ATP yield under each condition using the provided stoichiometry and coupling ratios. The problem is scientifically valid, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution.\n\n**1. ATP Yield from Aerobic Respiration of Glucose**\n\nThe complete aerobic oxidation of one molecule of glucose involves three major stages: glycolysis, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) reaction, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, followed by oxidative phosphorylation.\n\n**a. Glycolysis:**\nThis pathway occurs in the cytosol and converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate.\nThe overall net reaction for glycolysis is:\n$$\n\\text{Glucose} + 2 \\text{ ADP} + 2 \\text{ P}_i + 2 \\text{ NAD}^+ \\rightarrow 2 \\text{ Pyruvate} + 2 \\text{ ATP} + 2 \\text{ NADH} + 2 \\text{ H}^+ + 2 \\text{ H}_2\\text{O}\n$$\n- **Substrate-Level Phosphorylation (SLP):** There is a net gain of $2$ ATP molecules.\n- **Reducing Equivalents:** $2$ molecules of NADH are produced in the cytosol. The problem specifies the use of the malate-aspartate shuttle, which transports the reducing equivalents of these $2$ cytosolic NADH into the mitochondrial matrix, regenerating them as $2$ mitochondrial NADH.\n\n**b. Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC):**\nThe two pyruvate molecules are transported into the mitochondrial matrix and decarboxylated to form two molecules of acetyl-CoA.\nThe reaction for two pyruvate molecules is:\n$$\n2 \\text{ Pyruvate} + 2 \\text{ NAD}^+ + 2 \\text{ CoA} \\rightarrow 2 \\text{ Acetyl-CoA} + 2 \\text{ CO}_2 + 2 \\text{ NADH} + 2 \\text{ H}^+\n$$\n- **Reducing Equivalents:** $2$ molecules of NADH are produced in the mitochondrial matrix.\n\n**c. Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) Cycle:**\nThe two acetyl-CoA molecules enter the TCA cycle in the mitochondrial matrix. For each molecule of acetyl-CoA, the cycle produces $3$ NADH, $1$ FADH$_2$, and $1$ GTP. Since one glucose molecule yields two acetyl-CoA molecules, the total production from the TCA cycle is:\n$$\n2 \\text{ Acetyl-CoA} \\rightarrow 4 \\text{ CO}_2 + 6 \\text{ NADH} + 2 \\text{ FADH}_2 + 2 \\text{ GTP}\n$$\n- **Substrate-Level Phosphorylation:** $2$ molecules of GTP are produced. Per the problem statement, $1$ GTP is energetically equivalent to $1$ ATP, so this yields $2$ ATP.\n- **Reducing Equivalents:** $6$ molecules of NADH and $2$ molecules of FADH$_2$ are produced in the mitochondrial matrix.\n\n**d. Oxidative Phosphorylation:**\nThe reducing equivalents (NADH and FADH$_2$) generated in the preceding steps are oxidized by the electron transport chain, driving the synthesis of ATP.\n\n- **Total NADH produced:**\n  - From Glycolysis (via shuttle): $2$ NADH\n  - From PDC: $2$ NADH\n  - From TCA Cycle: $6$ NADH\n  - Total NADH = $2 + 2 + 6 = 10$ NADH\n\n- **Total FADH$_2$ produced:**\n  - From TCA Cycle: $2$ FADH$_2$\n\nUsing the given phosphate/oxygen (P/O) ratios:\n- ATP from $10$ NADH = $10 \\text{ NADH} \\times \\frac{2.5 \\text{ ATP}}{\\text{NADH}} = 25$ ATP\n- ATP from $2$ FADH$_2$ = $2 \\text{ FADH}_2 \\times \\frac{1.5 \\text{ ATP}}{\\text{FADH}_2} = 3$ ATP\n- Total ATP from oxidative phosphorylation = $25 + 3 = 28$ ATP.\n\n**e. Total Aerobic ATP Yield:**\nThe total yield is the sum of ATP from substrate-level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation.\n- ATP from SLP (Glycolysis + TCA) = $2 \\text{ ATP} + 2 \\text{ GTP} = 4$ ATP\n- ATP from Oxidative Phosphorylation = $28$ ATP\n- Total Aerobic Yield = $4 + 28 = 32$ ATP per molecule of glucose.\nTherefore, for $1$ mmol of glucose, the yield is $32$ mmol of ATP.\n\n**2. ATP Yield from Anaerobic Glycolysis**\n\nUnder severely hypoxic (anaerobic) conditions, the electron transport chain and thus oxidative phosphorylation cannot function. The PDC and TCA cycle also cease. Metabolism is limited to glycolysis.\n\n- **Glycolysis:** As in the aerobic case, glycolysis produces a net of $2$ ATP (via SLP) and $2$ NADH per molecule of glucose.\n  $$\n  \\text{Glucose} + 2 \\text{ ADP} + 2 \\text{ P}_i + 2 \\text{ NAD}^+ \\rightarrow 2 \\text{ Pyruvate} + 2 \\text{ ATP} + 2 \\text{ NADH} + 2 \\text{ H}^+ + 2 \\text{ H}_2\\text{O}\n  $$\n- **Lactate Fermentation:** For glycolysis to continue, the NAD$^+$ consumed must be regenerated. This is accomplished by reducing pyruvate to lactate, a reaction catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase. This step consumes the NADH produced during glycolysis.\n  $$\n  2 \\text{ Pyruvate} + 2 \\text{ NADH} + 2 \\text{ H}^+ \\rightarrow 2 \\text{ Lactate} + 2 \\text{ NAD}^+\n  $$\n- **Total Anaerobic ATP Yield:** The only ATP produced is the net gain from substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis. The NADH produced is immediately consumed to regenerate NAD$^+$, so it does not contribute to further ATP synthesis.\n- Total Anaerobic Yield = $2$ ATP per molecule of glucose.\nTherefore, for $1$ mmol of glucose, the yield is $2$ mmol of ATP.\n\n**3. Absolute ATP Deficit**\n\nThe energetic shortfall, or ATP deficit, is the difference between the ATP yield from aerobic and anaerobic metabolism.\n- ATP Deficit = (Total Aerobic Yield) - (Total Anaerobic Yield)\n- ATP Deficit = $32 \\text{ ATP} - 2 \\text{ ATP} = 30 \\text{ ATP}$ per molecule of glucose.\n\nFor $1$ mmol of glucose, the deficit is $30$ mmol of ATP. This significant drop in energy production compromises ATP-dependent processes, like the $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}/\\mathrm{K}^{+}$-ATPase, leading to the influx of ions and water, causing the cellular swelling characteristic of reversible injury.

The failure of energy-dependent ion pumps, like the $\\text{Na}^+/\\text{K}^+$-ATPase, leads to an accumulation of intracellular solutes and a subsequent influx of water. This practice delves into the fundamental physical chemistry that governs this process, guiding you to derive the van 't Hoff equation from the principle of chemical potential.

We will first derive the required linear relation and then compute the numerical value for the osmotic pressure.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the van 't Hoff Equation**\n\nThe fundamental condition for equilibrium of a solvent (in this case, water, denoted by subscript $w$) across a semipermeable membrane is the equality of its chemical potential, $\\mu_w$, in the two compartments. Let the intracellular compartment be denoted by 'I' and the extracellular compartment by 'E'. The equilibrium condition is:\n$$\n\\mu_w^I = \\mu_w^E\n$$\nThe chemical potential of a solvent in an ideal solution is given by:\n$$\n\\mu_w(P, T, x_w) = \\mu_w^*(P, T) + RT \\ln(x_w)\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_w^*(P, T)$ is the chemical potential of the pure solvent at pressure $P$ and temperature $T$, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $x_w$ is the mole fraction of the solvent.\n\nWe are given that an osmotic pressure difference, $\\Pi$, develops across the membrane. This pressure is defined as the excess hydrostatic pressure that must be applied to the compartment with the higher solute concentration to prevent the net influx of solvent. Let the extracellular compartment be at a reference pressure $P_E$, and the intracellular compartment be at a higher pressure $P_I = P_E + \\Pi$. The equilibrium condition becomes:\n$$\n\\mu_w^*(P_E + \\Pi, T) + RT \\ln(x_w^I) = \\mu_w^*(P_E, T) + RT \\ln(x_w^E)\n$$\nTo relate the chemical potential of the pure solvent at different pressures, we use the thermodynamic relation $(\\partial\\mu / \\partial P)_T = V_m$, where $V_m$ is the molar volume. For the pure solvent, this is $(\\partial\\mu_w^* / \\partial P)_T = V_{m,w}^*$. Integrating from $P_E$ to $P_E + \\Pi$ and assuming the solvent (water) is incompressible (i.e., $V_{m,w}^*$ is constant with pressure), we get:\n$$\n\\mu_w^*(P_E + \\Pi, T) - \\mu_w^*(P_E, T) = \\int_{P_E}^{P_E + \\Pi} V_{m,w}^* dP' = V_{m,w}^* \\Pi\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the equilibrium equation gives:\n$$\nV_{m,w}^* \\Pi + RT \\ln(x_w^I) = RT \\ln(x_w^E)\n$$\nRearranging for $\\Pi$:\n$$\n\\Pi = \\frac{RT}{V_{m,w}^*} \\left( \\ln(x_w^E) - \\ln(x_w^I) \\right)\n$$\nThe mole fraction of the solvent $x_w$ is related to the total mole fraction of all solute species, $x_s$, by $x_w = 1 - x_s$. Substituting this:\n$$\n\\Pi = \\frac{RT}{V_{m,w}^*} \\left( \\ln(1 - x_s^E) - \\ln(1 - x_s^I) \\right)\n$$\nThis expression is exact for ideal, incompressible solutions. We now invoke the **dilute solution approximation**. For dilute solutions, $x_s \\ll 1$. We can use the Taylor series expansion for the natural logarithm, $\\ln(1 - z) \\approx -z$ for small $z$. Applying this approximation:\n$$\n\\ln(1 - x_s^E) \\approx -x_s^E \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\ln(1 - x_s^I) \\approx -x_s^I\n$$\nThe expression for osmotic pressure simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Pi \\approx \\frac{RT}{V_{m,w}^*} \\left( -x_s^E - (-x_s^I) \\right) = \\frac{RT}{V_{m,w}^*} (x_s^I - x_s^E)\n$$\nNext, we relate the solute mole fraction $x_s$ to the molar concentration $C_s$. The mole fraction is $x_s = n_s / (n_s + n_w)$, where $n_s$ and $n_w$ are the moles of solute and solvent, respectively. For a dilute solution, $n_s \\ll n_w$, so $x_s \\approx n_s / n_w$.\nThe molar concentration of the solute is $C_s = n_s / V$, where $V$ is the total volume of the solution. For a dilute aqueous solution, the volume is dominated by the solvent, so $V \\approx n_w V_{m,w}^*$.\nTherefore, $C_s \\approx n_s / (n_w V_{m,w}^*)$. Combining these approximations, we find the relation:\n$$\n\\frac{x_s}{V_{m,w}^*} \\approx \\frac{n_s / n_w}{V_{m,w}^*} = C_s\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Pi$:\n$$\n\\Pi \\approx RT(C_s^I - C_s^E)\n$$\nFinally, we must account for the fact that a solute may dissociate into multiple osmotically active particles. The total concentration of all osmotically active particles is the osmolarity, $C_{osm}$. For a single solute dissociating into $\\nu$ particles with a nominal concentration $C_s$, the osmolarity is $C_{osm} = i C_s$, where $i$ is the van 't Hoff factor which accounts for dissociation. The derived linear relation, known as the van 't Hoff equation, relates the osmotic pressure difference to the difference in total osmolarity across the membrane:\n$$\n\\Pi = RT (C_{osm}^I - C_{osm}^E) = RT \\Delta C_{osm}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the osmotic pressure difference, $\\Pi$, resulting from an increase in intracellular osmolarity. We use the derived van 't Hoff equation:\n$$\n\\Pi = RT \\Delta C_{osm}\n$$\nThe given values are:\n-   Change in osmolarity, $\\Delta C_{osm} = 50\\,\\mathrm{mOsm} = 50 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{osmol\\,L^{-1}}$.\n-   Universal gas constant, $R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\n-   Absolute temperature, $T = 310\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nFirst, we must convert the osmolarity difference into SI units ($\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}}$). For the purpose of this calculation, the unit 'osmol' is treated as a 'mol' of osmotically active particles.\nUsing the conversion $1\\,\\mathrm{L} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m^{3}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta C_{osm} = 50 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{osmol}}{\\mathrm{L}} = 50 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m^3}} = 50\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}}\n$$\nNow, we can substitute the values into the equation:\n$$\n\\Pi = (50\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}}) \\times (8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (310\\,\\mathrm{K})\n$$\nThe units are consistent: $(\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}}) \\times (\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (\\mathrm{K}) = \\mathrm{J\\,m^{-3}}$. Since $1\\,\\mathrm{J} = 1\\,\\mathrm{N\\,m}$, this is equivalent to $\\mathrm{N\\,m\\,m^{-3}} = \\mathrm{N\\,m^{-2}}$, which is the definition of a Pascal ($\\mathrm{Pa}$).\n\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$\n\\Pi = 50 \\times 8.314 \\times 310 \\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 128867\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in kilopascals ($\\mathrm{kPa}$), where $1\\,\\mathrm{kPa} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n$$\n\\Pi = \\frac{128867}{1000}\\,\\mathrm{kPa} = 128.867\\,\\mathrm{kPa}\n$$\nFinally, rounding the result to three significant figures:\n$$\n\\Pi \\approx 129\\,\\mathrm{kPa}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{129}$$", "id": "4445711"}, {"introduction": "A pathologist or cell biologist must not only understand the mechanisms of cell injury but also be able to distinguish between different cellular fates based on morphological and molecular evidence.

The morphological descriptions for each population are classic and accurate representations of these cellular states. The fundamental principles provided for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion-induced swelling and caspase-mediated apoptosis are correct. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe core of the task is to identify a set of diagnostic tests that can definitively distinguish between the two cellular states described.\nPopulation $1$ exhibits reversible cell injury, specifically hydropic swelling. This is caused by transient hypoxia, leading to a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation and subsequent depletion of ATP. The lack of ATP impairs the function of the plasma membrane $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}/\\mathrm{K}^{+}$-ATPase pump. This failure leads to an influx of $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ ions, followed by an osmotic influx of water, causing cellular swelling. The morphological features described—cellular swelling, dilated endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondrial swelling—are all consequences of this osmotic dysregulation. Importantly, the plasma membrane remains physically intact, and there is no activation of the apoptotic cascade, hence no nuclear fragmentation.\n\nPopulation $2$ undergoes apoptosis, a programmed and orderly form of cell death, induced by staurosporine. This process is mechanistically distinct from hydropic swelling. It is an active, energy-dependent process mediated by a cascade of proteases called caspases. Activation of these enzymes leads to the characteristic features of apoptosis: cell shrinkage, condensation of nuclear chromatin, fragmentation of the nucleus and cytoplasm into membrane-bound apoptotic bodies, and externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Crucially, the plasma membrane maintains its integrity until the late stages, preventing the leakage of cytosolic components and thus avoiding an inflammatory response.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option by analyzing the proposed tests and their expected outcomes for both populations.\n\nA. **Population $2$ (apoptosis): phosphatidylserine externalization detected by annexin V binding positive with Propidium Iodide (PI) exclusion (annexin V$+$, PI$-$); elevated executioner caspase-$3$ activity. Population $1$ (reversible swelling): increased cell volume by Coulter counter/light scatter; Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL) negative (no DNA strand breaks).**\n\n*   **Population $2$ Analysis**: Staurosporine-induced apoptosis involves the externalization of PS, which serves as an \"eat me\" signal. Annexin V is a protein with high affinity for PS. In early apoptosis, the membrane is still intact, meaning it will exclude the DNA-intercalating dye, Propidium Iodide (PI). Therefore, an annexin V$+$, PI$-$ result is the canonical signature of early apoptosis. Apoptosis is executed by caspases, with caspase-$3$ being a key executioner caspase. Its activity would be significantly elevated. Both proposed tests and outcomes for Population $2$ are correct.\n*   **Population $1$ Analysis**: Reversible injury is defined by cellular swelling due to water influx. An increase in cell volume is the primary physical change, which can be precisely measured by a Coulter counter or as an increase in forward scatter by flow cytometry. The Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay detects the extensive DNA fragmentation characteristic of late-stage apoptosis. Since reversible injury does not involve this specific endonuclease activity and the problem states nuclei lack fragmentation, a TUNEL-negative result is expected. Both proposed tests and outcomes for Population $1$ are correct.\n*   **Conclusion**: This option accurately contrasts the two states with appropriate, mechanism-based tests and correct predictions.\n\nB. **Population $2$ (apoptosis): high Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) release into medium; early PI uptake; TUNEL negative.

Similarly, early PI uptake requires a ruptured membrane and is characteristic of necrosis. Apoptosis features DNA fragmentation, so a TUNEL-negative result is incorrect. These claims are incorrect.\n*   **Population $1$ Analysis**: A TUNEL-positive result is incorrect, as this is a marker for apoptosis.

A decrease in $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}/\\mathrm{K}^{+}$-ATPase activity is the primary cause of swelling in Population $1$, not the shrinkage seen in Population $2$. The problem explicitly states chromatin *condensation with margination* for Population $2$, the opposite of dispersion.

PI positivity indicates a ruptured membrane (necrosis or late apoptosis), contradicting the description of reversible injury with an intact membrane. These claims are incorrect.\n*   **Conclusion**: This option is incorrect on all points.\n\nD. **Population $2$ (apoptosis): cytochrome $c$ release immunoassay positive; caspase-$9$ activation; annexin V negative and PI positive throughout. Population $1$ (reversible swelling): decreased cell volume; caspase inhibition reverses swelling.**\n\n*   **Population $2$ Analysis**: Cytochrome $c$ release and subsequent caspase-$9$ activation are key steps in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, which can be induced by staurosporine. This part is correct. However, the claim of \"annexin V negative and PI positive throughout\" describes primary necrosis, not apoptosis. Apoptotic cells are characteristically annexin V positive in early stages. This part is incorrect.\n*   **Population $1$ Analysis**: The claim of decreased cell volume directly contradicts the \"overall cellular swelling\" described in the problem.
