The duration is $120$ minutes, which is greater than $45$ minutes. This contributes $2$ points to the score.\n3.  **Body Mass Index (BMI):** The patient's BMI is $36 \\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}}$.

A PE obstructs blood flow, creating a ventilation-perfusion ($V/Q$) mismatch that severely impairs gas exchange, a change that can be quantified by the alveolar-arterial ($A-a$) oxygen gradient.

The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary data for the alveolar gas equation. It is not contradictory, ambiguous, or trivial. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of the partial pressure of alveolar oxygen ($\\text{PAO}_2$) and the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (A–a gradient).\n\nThe derivation begins with Dalton's law, which states that the total pressure of a gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of its component gases. For inspired air that has been humidified in the upper airways, the total pressure is the atmospheric pressure, $P_{\\text{atm}}$. This pressure is composed of the partial pressures of nitrogen, oxygen, and water vapor.\n\nThe partial pressure of inspired oxygen, $\\text{PIO}_2$, is the fraction of oxygen in the inspired air, $\\text{FiO}_2$, multiplied by the total pressure of the dry gases. The total pressure of the dry gases is the atmospheric pressure minus the partial pressure of water vapor, $P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$.\n$$ \\text{PIO}_2 = \\text{FiO}_2 \\times (P_{\\text{atm}} - P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}) $$\n\nOnce the air reaches the alveoli, its composition changes. Oxygen is continuously transferred from the alveoli to the pulmonary capillary blood, and carbon dioxide is transferred from the blood to the alveoli. The partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli, $\\text{PAO}_2$, will therefore be lower than $\\text{PIO}_2$. The magnitude of this decrease is related to the amount of carbon dioxide that enters the alveoli.\n\nThis relationship is defined by the respiratory quotient, R, which is the ratio of the volume of carbon dioxide produced ($\\dot{V}_{\\text{CO}_2}$) to the volume of oxygen consumed ($\\dot{V}_{\\text{O}_2}$) in a steady state.\n$$ R = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{\\text{CO}_2}}{\\dot{V}_{\\text{O}_2}} $$\n\nUnder the assumption of a steady state, the rate of $\\text{O}_2$ removal from the alveoli is proportional to the rate of $\\text{CO}_2$ addition. The drop in oxygen partial pressure from inspired air to alveolar air is directly related to the partial pressure of alveolar carbon dioxide, $\\text{PACO}_2$, and inversely related to the respiratory quotient, R. This gives the alveolar gas equation:\n$$ \\text{PAO}_2 = \\text{PIO}_2 - \\frac{\\text{PACO}_2}{R} $$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\text{PIO}_2$, we obtain the full form of the equation:\n$$ \\text{PAO}_2 = \\left[ \\text{FiO}_2 \\times (P_{\\text{atm}} - P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}) \\right] - \\frac{\\text{PACO}_2}{R} $$\n\nIn clinical practice, it is assumed that the partial pressure of alveolar carbon dioxide, $\\text{PACO}_2$, is approximately equal to the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide, $\\text{PaCO}_2$, because carbon dioxide is highly soluble and equilibrates rapidly across the alveolar-capillary membrane. Thus, we can substitute $\\text{PaCO}_2$ for $\\text{PACO}_2$:\n$$ \\text{PAO}_2 \\approx \\left[ \\text{FiO}_2 \\times (P_{\\text{atm}} - P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}) \\right] - \\frac{\\text{PaCO}_2}{R} $$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into this derived equation to calculate $\\text{PAO}_2$:\n- $\\text{FiO}_2 = 0.21$\n- $P_{\\text{atm}} = 760$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- $P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}} = 47$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- $\\text{PaCO}_2 = 30$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- $R = 0.8$\n\nFirst, we calculate the partial pressure of inspired oxygen:\n$$ \\text{PIO}_2 = 0.21 \\times (760 - 47) \\, \\mathrm{mmHg} = 0.21 \\times 713 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg} = 149.73 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the reduction in oxygen pressure due to gas exchange:\n$$ \\frac{\\text{PaCO}_2}{R} = \\frac{30 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg}}{0.8} = 37.5 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg} $$\n\nFinally, we calculate $\\text{PAO}_2$:\n$$ \\text{PAO}_2 = 149.73 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg} - 37.5 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg} = 112.23 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\text{PAO}_2 = 112 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg} $$\n\nThe second part of the problem is to calculate the alveolar–arterial oxygen gradient (A–a gradient), defined as $\\text{PAO}_2 - \\text{PaO}_2$.\nUsing the unrounded value for $\\text{PAO}_2$ for greater precision in the intermediate step:\n$$ \\text{A–a gradient} = \\text{PAO}_2 - \\text{PaO}_2 = 112.23 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg} - 60 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg} = 52.23 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\text{A–a gradient} = 52.2 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg} $$\n\nThe results are the partial pressure of alveolar oxygen, $\\text{PAO}_2 = 112 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg}$, and the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, A–a gradient = $52.2 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg}$.
