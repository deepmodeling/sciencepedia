A solution will be provided.\n\nThe goal is to compute the post-test probability of amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) given a negative CTPA result. This is a problem of conditional probability, which can be solved by deriving Bayes' theorem from first principles as requested.\n\nFirst, let us define the events:\n-   Let $A$ be the event that the cause is Amniotic Fluid Embolism.\n-   Let $T$ be the event that the cause is Thrombotic Pulmonary Embolism.\n-   Let $O$ be the event that the cause is from the \"Other\" category.\n-   Let $N$ be the event that the CTPA result is Negative.\n\nThe provided pre-test (prior) probabilities are:\n-   $P(A) = 0.25$\n-   $P(T) = 0.35$\n-   $P(O) = 0.40$\nThe events $A$, $T$, and $O$ are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, as $P(A) + P(T) + P(O) = 0.25 + 0.35 + 0.40 = 1.00$.\n\nThe provided conditional probabilities of a negative CTPA for each etiology (the likelihoods) are:\n-   $P(N|A) = 0.90$\n-   $P(N|T) = 0.03$ (This is $1 - \\text{sensitivity}$, where sensitivity is $P(\\text{not } N|T) = 0.97$)\n-   $P(N|O) = 0.85$\n\nWe are asked to find the post-test (posterior) probability $P(A|N)$.\n\nAs stipulated, we begin with the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(A|N) = \\frac{P(A \\cap N)}{P(N)}$$\nThe term $P(A \\cap N)$ represents the joint probability of having AFE and a negative CTPA. This can be expressed using the definition of conditional probability for $P(N|A)$:\n$$P(N|A) = \\frac{P(A \\cap N)}{P(A)}$$\nRearranging this gives:\n$$P(A \\cap N) = P(N|A)P(A)$$\nSubstituting this back into our expression for $P(A|N)$ yields:\n$$P(A|N) = \\frac{P(N|A)P(A)}{P(N)}$$\nThis is Bayes' theorem.\n\nNext, we must find the denominator, $P(N)$, the total probability of a negative CTPA. As instructed, we use the law of total probability. Since the events $A$, $T$, and $O$ form a partition of the sample space, the event $N$ can be decomposed into its intersections with each of these events:\n$$P(N) = P(N \\cap A) + P(N \\cap T) + P(N \\cap O)$$\nUsing the same rearrangement of the conditional probability definition as before for each term, we get:\n$$P(N) = P(N|A)P(A) + P(N|T)P(T) + P(N|O)P(O)$$\nThis formula expresses the total probability of a negative test as the weighted average of the conditional probabilities of a negative test for each etiology, where the weights are the prior probabilities of the etiologies.\n\nNow, we combine these two results to get the full form of Bayes' theorem for this problem:\n$$P(A|N) = \\frac{P(N|A)P(A)}{P(N|A)P(A) + P(N|T)P(T) + P(N|O)P(O)}$$\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values into this derived formula.\n\nThe numerator is:\n$$P(N|A)P(A) = (0.90)(0.25) = 0.225$$\n\nThe terms in the denominator are:\n-   $P(N|A)P(A) = 0.225$\n-   $P(N|T)P(T) = (0.03)(0.35) = 0.0105$\n-   $P(N|O)P(O) = (0.85)(0.40) = 0.340$\n\nThe total probability of a negative CTPA, $P(N)$, is the sum of these terms:\n$$P(N) = 0.225 + 0.0105 + 0.340 = 0.5755$$\n\nFinally, we compute the posterior probability $P(A|N)$:\n$$P(A|N) = \\frac{0.225}{0.5755}$$\n$$P(A|N) \\approx 0.39096437880104257167680277932233$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $3$, $9$, $0$, and $9$.

It presents a classic clinical scenario of AFE with its associated triad of cardiovascular collapse, respiratory failure, and profound coagulopathy. The use of viscoelastic testing (ROTEM) and its specific parameters (EXTEM, FIBTEM) to guide hemostatic resuscitation is standard, evidence-based practice in modern anesthesiology and critical care. The physiological and pathological principles described (hyperfibrinogenemia of pregnancy, consumptive coagulopathy, critical fibrinogen levels) are all well-established in medical science.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear clinical history and a complete set of relevant ROTEM data, asking for an interpretation and a corresponding management decision. The information is sufficient and self-contained to derive a unique, logical answer based on established medical knowledge.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is objective. It uses precise, quantitative clinical data and established scientific terminology. The question asks for the \"best\" interpretation and an \"evidence-based\" threshold, which directs the solver to a non-subjective, data-driven conclusion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe patient's clinical presentation is highly suggestive of Amniotic Fluid Embolism (AFE), a catastrophic obstetric emergency often leading to a severe consumptive coagulopathy. The ROTEM results must be interpreted in this context.\n\n1.  **Analysis of ROTEM Data**:\n    - **EXTEM CT $= 120\\,\\mathrm{s}$**: The EXTEM (extrinsic pathway) clotting time is severely prolonged (typical reference range $\\approx 38-79\\,\\mathrm{s}$). This indicates a significant delay in the initiation of coagulation, which is caused by a deficiency of one or more clotting factors (e.g., factors II, V, VII, X) and/or a critically low level of fibrinogen (Factor I).\n    - **EXTEM $A10 = 15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$**: The amplitude of the clot at $10$ minutes in the EXTEM assay reflects the overall clot strength, which is a function of both the fibrin network and the platelet contribution. In a pregnant patient at term, a normal EXTEM $A10$ should be robust (e.g., $>50\\,\\mathrm{mm}$). A value of $15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ indicates a profoundly weak and unstable clot, confirming severe coagulopathy.\n    - **Platelet Count = $140 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$**: This value is at the lower limit of the normal range ($150-450 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$) or represents mild thrombocytopenia. It is insufficient on its own to explain the catastrophic failure of clot strength seen in the EXTEM $A10$. Therefore, the primary deficit must lie in the fibrin component of the clot.\n    - **FIBTEM $A5 = 6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and MCF $= 8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$**: The FIBTEM test pharmacologically inhibits platelets, thereby isolating the contribution of the fibrin network to clot strength. The amplitude at $5$ minutes ($A5$) is a validated early predictor of functional fibrinogen levels. During pregnancy, due to physiological hyperfibrinogenemia (plasma levels of $4-6\\,\\mathrm{g/L}$), a normal FIBTEM $A5$ is typically high, often $> 18-20\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The patient's FIBTEM $A5$ of $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ is critically low. This value correlates with a Clauss fibrinogen level of approximately $1.0-1.5\\,\\mathrm{g/L}$, far below the recognized critical threshold of $2\\,\\mathrm{g/L}$ in obstetric hemorrhage. The FIBTEM Maximum Clot Firmness (MCF) of $8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ (normal in pregnancy $> 25\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) confirms the severe deficit in fibrin-based clot strength. This finding is the hallmark of severe hypofibrinogenemia.\n    - **EXTEM ML $= 9\\%$**: Maximum Lysis (ML) reflects the percentage of clot breakdown at its maximum amplitude. A value of $<15\\%$ is generally considered normal. While AFE can involve a hyperfibrinolytic component, an ML of $9\\%$ does not indicate that primary hyperfibrinolysis is the dominant pathological process at this time. The primary problem is the failure to form a substantive clot.\n\n2.  **Synthesis**: The ROTEM pattern—prolonged EXTEM CT, severely reduced EXTEM $A10$, and critically low FIBTEM $A5$/MCF with a normal platelet count and non-elevated ML—is the classic signature of a dilutional and consumptive coagulopathy dominated by severe hypofibrinogenemia. This is the expected finding in AFE. Immediate and aggressive fibrinogen replacement is indicated.\n\n3.  **Evaluation of Options**:\n\n    **A. The pattern indicates hypofibrinogenemia with concurrent delayed initiation; initiate fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate when FIBTEM $A5<12\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ (or TEG functional fibrinogen MA $<10$ to $12\\,\\mathrm{mm}$), targeting Clauss fibrinogen $\\ge 2\\,\\mathrm{g/L}$ or FIBTEM $A5\\ge 12$ to $15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.**\n    This option provides an accurate interpretation. The low FIBTEM $A5$ demonstrates severe hypofibrinogenemia, and the prolonged EXTEM CT shows delayed initiation of clotting. The proposed intervention threshold (FIBTEM $A5 < 12\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) is a widely accepted, evidence-based trigger for fibrinogen replacement in major obstetric hemorrhage, as it corresponds well to the critical Clauss fibrinogen level of $< 2\\,\\mathrm{g/L}$. The therapeutic target (FIBTEM $A5 \\ge 12-15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) is also appropriate for restoring hemostatic competence.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n    **B. The pattern indicates primary hyperfibrinolysis; treat only if EXTEM ML $>20\\%$ with tranexamic acid; fibrinogen replacement is not indicated until Clauss fibrinogen $<1\\,\\mathrm{g/L}$.**\n    This interpretation is incorrect. The EXTEM ML is $9\\%$, which is not indicative of primary hyperfibrinolysis. The proposed threshold for fibrinogen replacement (Clauss fibrinogen $<1\\,\\mathrm{g/L}$) is dangerously low and contradicts current best practices, which advocate for replacement at $<2\\,\\mathrm{g/L}$ to improve outcomes.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n    **C. The pattern indicates isolated coagulation factor deficiency; correct with fresh frozen plasma to reduce EXTEM CT to $<80\\,\\mathrm{s}$; defer fibrinogen replacement.**\n    This interpretation is incomplete and misleading. While the prolonged EXTEM CT indicates factor deficiency, calling it \"isolated\" ignores the most critical finding: the severe hypofibrinogenemia shown by the FIBTEM test. Deferring specific fibrinogen replacement (with concentrate or cryoprecipitate) in favor of only FFP, which has a relatively low fibrinogen concentration, would fail to address the primary cause of the bleeding and would be substandard care.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n    **D. The pattern is within expected pregnancy variation; no fibrinogen therapy is indicated unless FIBTEM $A5<5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ or Clauss fibrinogen $<1\\,\\mathrm{g/L}$.**\n    This statement is profoundly incorrect. The ROTEM results are catastrophic and the diametric opposite of the normal hypercoagulable state of pregnancy. The proposed thresholds are dangerously low and reflect an outdated understanding of coagulopathy management.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n    **E. The pattern indicates thrombocytopenia as the primary driver of low clot strength; give platelets to raise EXTEM MCF to $>60\\,\\mathrm{mm}$; fibrinogen will correct secondarily.**\n    This interpretation is incorrect. The platelet count ($140 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$) is not low enough to be the primary cause of the coagulopathy. The FIBTEM result proves the deficit is in the fibrinogen-dependent clot structure. Giving platelets would be futile without a fibrin scaffold for them to adhere to.
