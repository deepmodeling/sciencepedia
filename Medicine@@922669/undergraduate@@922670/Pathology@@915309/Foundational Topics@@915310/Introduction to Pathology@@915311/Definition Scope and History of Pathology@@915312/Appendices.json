It provides a complete and consistent set of data ($TP, FP, TN, FN$) for a standard quantitative analysis task in diagnostic pathology, which is to compute fundamental performance metrics of a binary assay. All terms are standard and the required calculations follow directly from established principles of probability and statistics.\n\nWe begin by formally defining the events and the quantities derived from the provided data.\nLet $D^{+}$ be the event that a subject has the disease (condition positive) and $D^{-}$ be the event that a subject does not have the disease (condition negative).\nLet $T^{+}$ be the event of a positive test result and $T^{-}$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe provided counts are as follows:\n- True Positives ($TP$): The number of subjects with the disease who test positive. $N(D^{+} \\cap T^{+}) = TP = 80$.\n- False Positives ($FP$): The number of subjects without the disease who test positive. $N(D^{-} \\cap T^{+}) = FP = 20$.\n- True Negatives ($TN$): The number of subjects without the disease who test negative. $N(D^{-} \\cap T^{-}) = TN = 180$.\n- False Negatives ($FN$): The number of subjects with the disease who test negative. $N(D^{+} \\cap T^{-}) = FN = 20$.\n\nFrom these counts, we can calculate the marginal totals:\n- The total number of subjects with the disease is $N(D^{+}) = TP + FN = 80 + 20 = 100$.\n- The total number of subjects without the disease is $N(D^{-}) = FP + TN = 20 + 180 = 200$.\n- The total number of subjects in the study is $N_{total} = TP + FP + TN + FN = 80 + 20 + 180 + 20 = 300$.\n\nNow, we compute the required quantities from these first principles.\n\n1.  **Sensitivity ($Se$)**:\n    Sensitivity is the probability of a positive test result given that the subject has the disease. It is the true positive rate.\n    $$Se = P(T^{+} | D^{+}) = \\frac{N(T^{+} \\cap D^{+})}{N(D^{+})} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$Se = \\frac{80}{80 + 20} = \\frac{80}{100} = 0.8$$\n    Rounded to three significant figures, $Se = 0.800$.\n\n2.  **Specificity ($Sp$)**:\n    Specificity is the probability of a negative test result given that the subject does not have the disease. It is the true negative rate.\n    $$Sp = P(T^{-} | D^{-}) = \\frac{N(T^{-} \\cap D^{-})}{N(D^{-})} = \\frac{TN}{FP + TN}$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$Sp = \\frac{180}{20 + 180} = \\frac{180}{200} = 0.9$$\n    Rounded to three significant figures, $Sp = 0.900$.\n\n3.  **Accuracy**:\n    Accuracy is the proportion of all tests that yielded a correct result (true positives and true negatives) out of the total number of tests conducted.\n    $$Accuracy = \\frac{N(TP) + N(TN)}{N_{total}} = \\frac{TP + TN}{TP + FP + TN + FN}$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$Accuracy = \\frac{80 + 180}{80 + 20 + 180 + 20} = \\frac{260}{300} = \\frac{13}{15} \\approx 0.8666...$$\n    Rounded to three significant figures, $Accuracy = 0.867$.\n\n4.  **Positive Likelihood Ratio ($LR^{+}$)**:\n    The positive likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probability of a positive test in a diseased individual to the probability of a positive test in a non-diseased individual.

It is the ratio of the false negative rate ($FNR$) to the true negative rate ($Sp$).\n    $$LR^{-} = \\frac{P(T^{-} | D^{+})}{P(T^{-} | D^{-})}$$\n    The numerator is the false negative rate, which is $1 - Se$, since $P(T^{-} | D^{+}) + P(T^{+} | D^{+}) = 1$ and $P(T^{+} | D^{+}) = Se$.\n    Thus, $P(T^{-} | D^{+}) = 1 - Se = 1 - 0.800 = 0.200$.\n    The denominator is specificity, $P(T^{-} | D^{-}) = Sp$.\n    The formula is:\n    $$LR^{-} = \\frac{1 - Se}{Sp}$$\n    Substituting the computed values:\n    $$LR^{-} = \\frac{1 - 0.800}{0.900} = \\frac{0.200}{0.900} = \\frac{2}{9} \\approx 0.2222...$$\n    Rounded to three significant figures, $LR^{-} = 0.222$.\n\n**Interpretation of Likelihood Ratios in Clinical Decision-Making:**\nLikelihood ratios are used to update a pre-test probability of disease to a post-test probability using the Bayesian relationship: Post-test Odds = Pre-test Odds $\\times$ Likelihood Ratio.\nThe magnitude of the positive likelihood ratio, $LR^{+} = 8.00$, indicates that a positive test result is $8$ times more likely to occur in a person with the disease than in a person without it. In pathology, a moderately high $LR^{+}$ (typically $LR^{+} > 5$) provides substantial evidence to increase the probability of disease, thereby strengthening a diagnostic conclusion and potentially lowering the threshold for initiating treatment or further investigation.\nThe magnitude of the negative likelihood ratio, $LR^{-} = 0.222$, indicates that a negative test result significantly decreases the estimated probability of disease. A value of $LR^{-}$ between $0.1$ and $0.2$ is considered moderately useful for ruling out a condition. With this test, a negative result makes the revised odds of disease approximately a fifth ($0.222$) of the original odds, providing a pathologist with considerable confidence to rule out the disease and advise against further, potentially harmful or costly, interventions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.800 & 0.900 & 0.867 & 8.00 & 0.222\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4352884"}, {"introduction": "While sensitivity and specificity describe a test's intrinsic characteristics, their clinical utility depends on the context in which the test is used.

Consider a biomarker assay for a disease, measured in nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL), applied to a cohort of $200$ individuals comprising $100$ with disease and $100$ without disease. For a given decision threshold $T$ (in ng/mL), the test calls an individual positive if the biomarker is $\\geq T$ and negative otherwise.

A solution will be furnished.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nIn diagnostic medicine, the performance of a test is characterized by its ability to correctly classify individuals. The two primary metrics are sensitivity and specificity.\n\nSensitivity, also known as the True Positive Rate ($\\text{TPR}$), measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified as such.\n$$ \\text{Sensitivity (TPR)} = \\frac{\\text{TP}}{\\text{TP} + \\text{FN}} = \\frac{\\text{Number of correctly identified diseased individuals}}{\\text{Total number of diseased individuals}} $$\n\nSpecificity, also known as the True Negative Rate ($\\text{TNR}$), measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified as such.\n$$ \\text{Specificity (TNR)} = \\frac{\\text{TN}}{\\text{TN} + \\text{FP}} = \\frac{\\text{Number of correctly identified non-diseased individuals}}{\\text{Total number of non-diseased individuals}} $$\n\nA Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve visualizes the trade-off between these two metrics by plotting sensitivity ($\\text{TPR}$) against $1 - \\text{specificity}$ (the False Positive Rate, $\\text{FPR}$) for various threshold settings.\nAn ideal test would have a sensitivity of $1$ and a specificity of $1$, corresponding to the point $(0, 1)$ on the ROC plot (where the x-axis is $1 - \\text{specificity}$). A random-guess test corresponds to the diagonal line $\\text{TPR} = \\text{FPR}$.\n\nThe selection of an \"optimal\" threshold involves finding a point on the ROC curve that represents the best balance between sensitivity and specificity. The specific definition of \"best\" depends on the clinical context (e.g., the relative costs of false positives vs. false negatives). However, a common and objective criterion, when no specific costs are given, is to maximize the separation of the test's performance from random chance. This is achieved by finding the threshold that maximizes the Youden's J statistic (or Youden's index), $J$.\n\nThe Youden's J statistic is defined as:\n$$ J = \\text{Sensitivity} + \\text{Specificity} - 1 $$\nThis value represents the maximum vertical distance from the ROC curve to the line of no-discrimination (the diagonal). Maximizing $J$ is equivalent to maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity, thus providing a quantitative measure for the balance between them.\n\nFor the given problem, the number of diseased individuals is $N_D = 100$ and the number of non-diseased individuals is $N_{ND} = 100$. The formulas for sensitivity and specificity for each threshold $T$ simplify to:\n$$ \\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{\\text{TP}}{100} $$\n$$ \\text{Specificity} = \\frac{\\text{TN}}{100} $$\nTherefore, the Youden's J statistic is:\n$$ J(T) = \\frac{\\text{TP}}{100} + \\frac{\\text{TN}}{100} - 1 = \\frac{\\text{TP} + \\text{TN} - 100}{100} $$\n\nWe now compute $J$ for each given threshold:\n- For $T=1.5$: $J = \\frac{95 + 20 - 100}{100} = \\frac{15}{100} = 0.15$\n- For $T=2.0$: $J = \\frac{92 + 30 - 100}{100} = \\frac{22}{100} = 0.22$\n- For $T=2.8$: $J = \\frac{88 + 45 - 100}{100} = \\frac{33}{100} = 0.33$\n- For $T=3.6$: $J = \\frac{82 + 65 - 100}{100} = \\frac{47}{100} = 0.47$\n- For $T=4.5$: $J = \\frac{75 + 78 - 100}{100} = \\frac{53}{100} = 0.53$\n- For $T=5.2$: $J = \\frac{68 + 85 - 100}{100} = \\frac{53}{100} = 0.53$\n- For $T=6.0$: $J = \\frac{60 + 90 - 100}{100} = \\frac{50}{100} = 0.50$\n- For $T=7.5$: $J = \\frac{50 + 95 - 100}{100} = \\frac{45}{100} = 0.45$\n\nThe maximum value of the Youden's J statistic is $0.53$. This maximum value occurs at two thresholds: $T=4.5$ ng/mL and $T=5.2$ ng/mL. The problem specifies that in the case of a tie, the lowest threshold should be selected.\n\nTherefore, the optimal threshold that maximizes the Youden's J statistic, according to the specified tie-breaking rule, is $T = 4.5$ ng/mL. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures. The value $4.5$ already has two significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.5}$$", "id": "4352837"}]}
