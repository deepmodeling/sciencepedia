The derivation is to start from the fundamental definitions of the acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, and $pH$.\n\nFirst, we consider the chemical equilibria of the bicarbonate buffer system in an aqueous solution. The overall process, which combines the hydration of carbon dioxide and the dissociation of the resulting carbonic acid, can be represented as:\n$$CO_2(aq) + H_2O(l) \\rightleftharpoons H^+(aq) + HCO_3^-(aq)$$\nIn this equilibrium, dissolved carbon dioxide, $[CO_2]$, acts as the weak acid, and bicarbonate, $[HCO_3^-]$, acts as its conjugate base.
