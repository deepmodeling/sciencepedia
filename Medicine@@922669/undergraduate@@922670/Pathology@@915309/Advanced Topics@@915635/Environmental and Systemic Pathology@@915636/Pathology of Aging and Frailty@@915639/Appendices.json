Consider a single-compartment tissue in which the fraction of cells that are senescent, denoted by $S(t)$, changes over chronological age $t$ according to two processes grounded in conservation of mass and first-order kinetics: (i) a constant induction of senescent cells at a rate $ \\lambda $ (per year), reflecting the average rate of new senescent cell formation due to damage and stress; and (ii) immune-mediated clearance that removes senescent cells at a rate proportional to their current burden, with proportionality constant $ \\mu $ (per year). \n\nStarting from these principles, first construct the ordinary differential equation governing $S(t)$ and solve it for $S(t)$ given the initial condition $S(0)=0$, corresponding to negligible senescent burden at birth.

Clearance is modeled as first-order in the burden, so the removal rate is proportional to $S(t)$ with constant $ \\mu $ (units: per year). Therefore, the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) is\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\lambda - \\mu S(t).\n$$\nThis is a linear first-order ODE with constant coefficients.
