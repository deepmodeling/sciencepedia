The exposure index is the ratio of the worker's $8$-hour time-weighted average (TWA) exposure to the Occupational Exposure Limit (OEL).\n\nThe TWA exposure is defined as the sum of the products of concentration $C_i$ and duration $t_i$ for each distinct period of exposure, divided by the total duration of the shift.

A dose $D$ is administered, but only a fraction $F$ (the bioavailability) reaches the systemic circulation. Therefore, the bioavailable dose is $F \\cdot D$.
