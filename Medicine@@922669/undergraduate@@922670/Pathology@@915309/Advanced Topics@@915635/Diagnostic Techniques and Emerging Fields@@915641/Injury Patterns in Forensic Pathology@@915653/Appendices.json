This exercise demonstrates how fundamental geometric principles can be a powerful tool in this process, specifically by reconstructing an object's physical characteristics from a patterned contusion. By applying geometric relationships to the measurements of an arc-shaped bruise, you will develop a quantitative estimate of the weapon's size, turning a simple observation into a crucial piece of evidence. [@problem_id:4392983]", "problem": "A decedent presents with a single, well-demarcated, arc-shaped contusion on the lateral thigh. The arc is consistent with focal contact from a cylindrical blunt object, such as a pipe or baton, and the local skin deformation can be approximated as conforming to a circular cross-section over the contact area.

Assuming the bruise geometry reflects a circular arc made by the cross-sectional curvature of the object, and neglecting tissue compliance beyond the arc geometry, start from core geometric definitions of a circle, chord, and sagitta to derive an expression for the circle radius $R$ in terms of the chord length $c$ and sagitta $s$. Use your derived expression to compute the curvature radius $R$ of the rod-like object and then infer the object's diameter $D$ under the assumption that the object is a right circular cylinder with cross-sectional radius equal to the curvature radius of the arc. Express the final diameter in centimeters. Give an exact value; do not round. Report only the likely object diameter $D$.", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the diameter of a cylindrical object based on the geometric properties of a contusion it caused. The contusion is modeled as a circular arc. The provided measurements are the chord length, $c$, and the sagitta, $s$, of this arc.\n\nFirst, we must establish the geometric relationship between the radius of a circle, $R$, a chord of that circle, $c$, and the corresponding sagitta, $s$. Let us consider a circle with center $O$ and radius $R$. A chord is a line segment whose endpoints both lie on the circle. Let the length of the chord be $c$. The sagitta, $s$, is the distance from the center of the chord to the arc, measured along the line perpendicular to the chord that passes through the circle's center.\n\nLet the chord be denoted by the segment $AB$, with length $|AB| = c$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of the chord $AB$. The line from the center $O$ to the midpoint $M$ of the chord is perpendicular to the chord. The length of the segment $AM$ (or $MB$) is half the chord length, so $|AM| = \\frac{c}{2}$.\n\nThe radius from the center $O$ that passes through $M$ intersects the circle at a point $P$. The segment $MP$ is the sagitta, so $|MP| = s$. The segment $OP$ is a radius of the circle, so $|OP| = R$. The distance from the center $O$ to the midpoint of the chord, $M$, can be expressed as the difference between the radius and the sagitta: $|OM| = |OP| - |MP| = R - s$.\n\nNow, consider the right-angled triangle $\\triangle OMA$. The hypotenuse is the radius $OA$, so $|OA| = R$. The two legs are the segments $OM$ and $AM$, with lengths $|OM| = R-s$ and $|AM| = \\frac{c}{2}$.\n\nBy the Pythagorean theorem, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides:\n$$|OA|^2 = |OM|^2 + |AM|^2$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the lengths of the sides, we get:\n$$R^2 = (R-s)^2 + \\left(\\frac{c}{2}\\right)^2$$\nThis equation establishes the fundamental relationship between $R$, $c$, and $s$. We are asked to derive an expression for $R$ in terms of $c$ and $s$. To do so, we expand the squared term $(R-s)^2$:\n$$R^2 = (R^2 - 2Rs + s^2) + \\frac{c^2}{4}$$\nThe $R^2$ term appears on both sides of the equation and can be cancelled:\n$$0 = -2Rs + s^2 + \\frac{c^2}{4}$$\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for $R$. We move the term containing $R$ to the other side:\n$$2Rs = s^2 + \\frac{c^2}{4}$$\nFinally, we isolate $R$ by dividing both sides by $2s$. We must assume $s \\neq 0$, which is true in this problem as $s=1 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$.\n$$R = \\frac{s^2}{2s} + \\frac{c^2}{8s}$$\n$$R = \\frac{s}{2} + \\frac{c^2}{8s}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the radius of curvature $R$ in terms of the chord length $c$ and the sagitta $s$.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Chord length, $c = 6 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$\n- Sagitta, $s = 1 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$\n\nWe can now substitute these values into our derived formula for $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{6^2}{8(1)}$$\n$$R = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{36}{8}$$\nSimplifying the fraction $\\frac{36}{8}$:\n$$R = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{9}{2}$$\n$$R = \\frac{1+9}{2} = \\frac{10}{2}$$\n$$R = 5 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$$\nThe radius of curvature of the arc, which is assumed to be the cross-sectional radius of the cylindrical object, is $5 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nThe final step is to determine the diameter $D$ of the object. The diameter is twice the radius:\n$$D = 2R$$\n$$D = 2 \\times 5 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$$\n$$D = 10 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$$\nThus, based on the provided measurements and the geometric model, the likely diameter of the rod-like object is $10 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$.

This practice guides you through building a mathematical model to solve this problem, based on the principle that the dispersion of gunpowder particles (stippling) increases predictably with distance. Using calibration data to define a linear equation, you will learn a fundamental technique for quantitative forensic estimation and see the importance of corroborating your findings with other evidence, such as the presence of soot.

A linear relationship can be described by the equation:\n$$R(D) = mD + c$$\nwhere $m$ is the slope of the line and $c$ is the y-intercept.\n\nWe are given two calibration points from the firearm-ammunition combination:\n1.

At a distance $D_2 = 50\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, the radius is $R_2 = 8\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nThese two points, $(D_1, R_1) = (10, 2)$ and $(D_2, R_2) = (50, 8)$, can be used to determine the parameters $m$ and $c$ of the linear model.\n\nFirst, we calculate the slope $m$ of the line:\n$$m = \\frac{\\Delta R}{\\Delta D} = \\frac{R_2 - R_1}{D_2 - D_1}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$m = \\frac{8 - 2}{50 - 10} = \\frac{6}{40} = \\frac{3}{20}$$\nThe numerical value of the slope is $m = 0.15$. The units of the slope are $\\mathrm{cm/cm}$, making it a dimensionless quantity.\n\nNext, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation, $R - R_1 = m(D - D_1)$, to find the intercept $c$. By rearranging to solve for $c$ using the first point $(10, 2)$:\n$$R_1 = mD_1 + c$$\n$$c = R_1 - mD_1$$\nSubstituting the values for $R_1$, $D_1$, and the calculated slope $m$:\n$$c = 2 - \\left(\\frac{3}{20}\\right)(10) = 2 - \\frac{30}{20} = 2 - \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} - \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe numerical value of the y-intercept is $c = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. A value of $c = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ suggests a non-zero stippling radius at a theoretical distance of $D=0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, which can be interpreted as an artifact of the linear model's fit to data in a specific range and may not represent the physical reality at contact range.\n\nThe complete linear model is therefore:\n$$R(D) = \\frac{3}{20}D + \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThe problem requires us to estimate the firing distance $D$ for a case where the measured stippling radius is $R_{obs} = 5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. To do this, we must invert the model to express $D$ as a function of $R$:\n$$R - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{20}D$$\n$$D(R) = \\frac{20}{3}\\left(R - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the observed radius $R_{obs} = 5$ into this inverted equation to find the estimated distance, $D_{est}$:\n$$D_{est} = \\frac{20}{3}\\left(5 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\n$$D_{est} = \\frac{20}{3}\\left(\\frac{10}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{20}{3}\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)$$\n$$D_{est} = \\frac{20 \\times 9}{3 \\times 2} = \\frac{180}{6} = 30$$\nThe estimated firing distance is exactly $30\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nFinally, we perform the consistency check. The problem states that visible soot deposition is generally observed up to approximately $30\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, and that sparse soot was found in the case. Our calculated distance of $30\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ falls at the upper boundary of this range. The presence of \"sparse\" soot is entirely consistent with a firing distance at the limit of soot deposition. Therefore, the linear estimate is not contradicted by the qualitative observation.\n\nThe problem requests the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $30$.
