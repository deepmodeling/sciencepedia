It describes a standard application of probability theory to a real-world biomedical problem, minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring, using established statistical models. All necessary parameters are provided for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem asks for an explanation of how sample size affects detection probability and a specific calculation. The explanation will proceed from the foundational model of independent Bernoulli trials to its approximation by the Poisson distribution in the rare-event limit.\n\nLet $p$ be the true frequency of MRD cells in a specimen. This represents the probability that any single cell sampled is a leukemic cell. Let $N$ be the total number of cells acquired and analyzed by the flow cytometer. We assume that the cells are sampled independently.\n\nLet $K$ be the random variable representing the total number of MRD cells observed in the sample of size $N$. Each of the $N$ cells acquired can be considered an independent Bernoulli trial, where \"success\" (observing an MRD cell) occurs with probability $p$. The total number of successes, $K$, in $N$ trials follows a binomial distribution, denoted as $K \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N, p)$.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for the binomial distribution gives the probability of observing exactly $k$ MRD cells:\n$$P(K=k) = \\binom{N}{k} p^k (1-p)^{N-k}$$\n\nThe clinical question is whether *any* residual cells are detected, which corresponds to the event $K \\ge 1$. It is computationally simpler to calculate the probability of the complement event, $K=0$ (observing zero MRD cells), and subtract this from $1$.\nUsing the binomial PMF, the probability of observing zero MRD cells is:\n$$P(K=0) = \\binom{N}{0} p^0 (1-p)^{N-0} = (1-p)^N$$\nTherefore, the exact probability of detecting at least one MRD cell is:\n$$P(K \\ge 1) = 1 - P(K=0) = 1 - (1-p)^N$$\n\nTo understand how increasing the total acquired events $N$ affects this probability, we examine the term $(1-p)^N$. Since $p$ is a probability, $0  p  1$, which implies $0  (1-p)  1$. For a base in this range, the function $f(N) = (1-p)^N$ is a strictly decreasing function of $N$. Consequently, as $N$ increases, $(1-p)^N$ decreases, approaching $0$. This means that $P(K \\ge 1) = 1 - (1-p)^N$ strictly increases with $N$, approaching $1$. Thus, increasing the sample size enhances the probability of detecting the disease if it is present.\n\nThe problem states that MRD monitoring involves a rare-event process, justifying the use of a limit. This refers to the Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution. This approximation is valid when $N$ is large and $p$ is small, such that their product, $\\lambda = Np$, is a finite, moderate value. In MRD detection, this is precisely the case: the frequency of leukemic cells $p$ is very low (e.g., $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-6}$), while the number of analyzed cells $N$ is very large (e.g., $10^5$ to $10^7$). The product $\\lambda = Np$ represents the expected number of MRD cells in the sample.\n\nTo derive this limit from first principles, we start with the binomial PMF and take the limit as $N \\to \\infty$ and $p \\to 0$ while keeping $\\lambda=Np$ constant.\n$$P(K=k) = \\frac{N!}{k!(N-k)!} p^k (1-p)^{N-k}$$\nSubstitute $p = \\lambda/N$:\n$$P(K=k) = \\frac{N(N-1)\\cdots(N-k+1)}{k!} \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{N}\\right)^k \\left(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{N}\\right)^{N-k}$$\nRearranging terms:\n$$P(K=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k}{k!} \\left(\\frac{N}{N} \\cdot \\frac{N-1}{N} \\cdots \\frac{N-k+1}{N}\\right) \\left(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{N}\\right)^N \\left(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{N}\\right)^{-k}$$\nNow we evaluate the limit of each part as $N \\to \\infty$:\n1. The product $\\left(1 \\cdot \\left(1-\\frac{1}{N}\\right) \\cdots \\left(1-\\frac{k-1}{N}\\right)\\right) \\to 1$, since $k$ is a fixed finite number.\n2. The term $\\left(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{N}\\right)^N \\to \\exp(-\\lambda)$, from the fundamental limit definition of the exponential function.\n3. The term $\\left(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{N}\\right)^{-k} \\to (1-0)^{-k} = 1$.\n\nCombining these results, the binomial probability converges to the Poisson probability:\n$$\\lim_{N\\to\\infty, p\\to 0, Np=\\lambda} P(K=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nThis is the PMF of a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$. Therefore, under the specified conditions, the count of MRD cells $K$ can be modeled as $K \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda=Np)$.\n\nUsing this Poisson model, we can again compute the probability of detecting at least one MRD cell.\n$$P(K \\ge 1) = 1 - P(K=0)$$\nFor a Poisson distribution, the probability of zero events is:\n$$P(K=0) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{0!} = \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nThus, the probability of detection is:\n$$P(K \\ge 1) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda) = 1 - \\exp(-Np)$$\nThis expression again shows that as $N$ increases, the exponent $-Np$ becomes more negative, $\\exp(-Np)$ decreases, and the detection probability $1 - \\exp(-Np)$ increases, confirming the principle that larger sample acquisitions improve detection sensitivity.\n\nWe are asked to compute this probability for the specific case where the true MRD frequency is $p = 10^{-5}$ and the instrument acquires $N = 10^6$ total cells.\n\nFirst, we calculate the Poisson parameter $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = Np = (10^6)(10^{-5}) = 10$$\nThis value represents the expected number of MRD cells in the sample.\n\nNext, we calculate the probability of observing at least one MRD cell using the Poisson approximation:\n$$P(K \\ge 1) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda) = 1 - \\exp(-10)$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\\exp(-10) \\approx 0.00004539992976$$\n$$P(K \\ge 1) \\approx 1 - 0.00004539992976 = 0.99995460007023$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final probability to $5$ significant figures.
