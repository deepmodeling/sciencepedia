Tacrolimus levels are within the target range.\n- Histopathology (Allograft Biopsy):\n    - Interstitial inflammation: $i=3$ (inflammation involving >50% of non-sclerotic cortex).\n    - Tubulitis: $t=3$ (severe tubulitis).\n    - Intimal arteritis: $v=1$ (arteritis present in at least one artery without luminal occlusion).\n    - Glomerulitis: $g=0$ (absent).\n    - Peritubular capillaritis: $ptc=0$ (absent).\n    - Complement split product C4d: Negative by immunohistochemistry.\n- Question: Determine the diagnostic category for rejection and the corresponding management implication based on the standardized framework.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\nThe diagnosis of kidney allograft rejection is made using the Banff Classification, which integrates clinical, serological, and histopathological findings. The provided biopsy scores are key to this process.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Biopsy Scores for T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR)**:\n    - The Banff classification grades TCMR based on the severity of interstitial inflammation ($i$), tubulitis ($t$), and intimal arteritis ($v$).\n    - The patient has interstitial inflammation score $i=3$ (>50% of cortex inflamed) and tubulitis score $t=3$ (severe tubulitis). Based on these two scores alone, the findings meet the criteria for at least Banff TCMR Grade IB (inflammation in >25% of cortex and severe tubulitis).\n    - Critically, the biopsy also shows intimal arteritis $v=1$ (mild-to-moderate inflammation of the arterial intima). The presence of any intimal arteritis ($v>0$) signifies vascular rejection.\n    - According to the Banff criteria, $v=1$ defines **TCMR Grade IIA**.\n    - When criteria for multiple grades of TCMR are met, the highest (most severe) grade is assigned. Grade IIA (vascular rejection) is more severe than Grade IB (tubulointerstitial rejection). Therefore, the definitive diagnosis for the T-cell mediated component is TCMR Grade IIA.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Biopsy Scores for Antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR)**:\n    - The diagnosis of active ABMR requires three criteria to be met:\n        1.  Histologic evidence of acute tissue injury. This can include microvascular inflammation ($g>0$ or $ptc>0$), intimal or transmural arteritis ($v>0$), or thrombotic microangiopathy. The patient has $v=1$, so this criterion is technically met.\n        2.  Evidence of antibody interaction with the endothelium. The primary finding is C4d deposition in peritubular capillaries ($C4d > 0$ by IHC or IF). In C4d-negative cases, this criterion can be met if there is at least moderate microvascular inflammation ($g+ptc \\ge 2$) and positive donor-specific antibodies (DSAs).\n        3.  Serologic evidence of circulating DSAs.\n    - In this case, the key findings for ABMR are negative. Microvascular inflammation is absent ($g=0$, $ptc=0$). C4d deposition is negative. While information on DSAs is not provided, the complete absence of microvascular inflammation and C4d makes a diagnosis of active ABMR highly unlikely and unsubstantiated by the biopsy. The arteritis ($v=1$) in this context is attributed to the TCMR process.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on Diagnosis**: Based on the definitive finding of $v=1$, the diagnosis is **T cell–mediated rejection (TCMR), Grade IIA**. There is no evidence to support a diagnosis of ABMR or borderline changes.\n\n4.  **Management Implications**:\n    - The management of acute rejection depends on its type and grade.\n    - TCMR Grade IIA (vascular rejection) is a serious form of rejection that requires prompt and aggressive treatment.\n    - The first-line therapy for TCMR, including Grade IIA, is high-dose intravenous corticosteroids (e.g., \"pulse\" methylprednisolone).\n    - If the rejection does not respond to corticosteroids (steroid-refractory rejection), or in some cases as initial therapy for severe vascular rejection, treatment is escalated to a lymphocyte-depleting agent, such as anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG).\n\n### Step 3: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. T cell–mediated rejection (TCMR) grade IB; initiate supportive care and close observation without anti-rejection therapy**\n- **Diagnosis**: Incorrect. While the $i=3$ and $t=3$ scores meet the criteria for Grade IB, the presence of $v=1$ elevates the diagnosis to Grade IIA, which is the more severe and overriding diagnosis.\n- **Management**: Incorrect. Active rejection, especially of this severity, is an absolute indication for potent anti-rejection therapy. Supportive care alone would lead to graft loss.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**B. T cell–mediated rejection (TCMR) grade IIA; initiate high-dose corticosteroids and consider lymphocyte-depleting therapy if steroid-refractory**\n- **Diagnosis**: Correct. The finding of $v=1$ (mild-to-moderate intimal arteritis) is the defining feature of TCMR Grade IIA.\n- **Management**: Correct. The standard treatment algorithm for TCMR Grade IIA is to start with high-dose corticosteroids, with lymphocyte-depleting agents reserved for cases that are refractory to steroid therapy.\n- **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**C. Antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR); initiate plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin, and anti-CD20 therapy**\n- **Diagnosis**: Incorrect. There is no evidence of ABMR. The key markers, microvascular inflammation ($g=0, ptc=0$) and C4d deposition (C4d negative), are absent.\n- **Management**: Incorrect. The proposed therapy is for ABMR, not TCMR.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. Borderline changes suspicious for acute T cell–mediated rejection; intensify maintenance immunosuppression only**\n- **Diagnosis**: Incorrect. The finding of $i=3$, $t=3$, and $v=1$ far exceeds the Banff criteria for \"borderline changes,\" which involve milder inflammation with no arteritis. The findings are diagnostic of definite, not suspicious, rejection.\n- **Management**: Incorrect. Intensifying maintenance immunosuppression is a strategy for borderline changes, not for severe, established vascular rejection.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**E. Mixed rejection (TCMR IIA and ABMR); initiate combined therapy for TCMR and ABMR**\n- **Diagnosis**: Incorrect. While there is clear evidence for TCMR Grade IIA, there is no evidence to support a concurrent diagnosis of ABMR.\n- **Management**: Incorrect. Since there is no ABMR component, therapy directed against antibodies and B cells is not indicated.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4459870"}, {"introduction": "A crucial skill in transplant pathology is distinguishing true allograft rejection from its mimics. This practice problem presents a scenario where the histologic signs of inflammation, such as tubulitis, could easily be mistaken for TCMR. However, the presence of specific viral clues requires a broader differential diagnosis. This exercise will guide you through the process of integrating standard histology with ancillary tests, like immunohistochemistry for SV40 and viral load quantification by PCR, to correctly identify BK polyomavirus nephropathy and select the appropriate management, which is fundamentally different from that for rejection.", "problem": "A patient is 6 months post kidney allograft transplantation and presents with a rise in serum creatinine from 1.4 to 2.1 mg/dL. The patient is maintained on tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. A percutaneous kidney allograft biopsy shows interstitial inflammation and tubular epithelial injury. Using standardized histologic scoring, the pathologist records interstitial inflammation i2, tubulitis t2, intimal arteritis v0. Peritubular capillaritis is minimal, and complement component 4d (C4d) staining in peritubular capillaries is negative. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) with an antibody to Simian Virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen shows strong nuclear staining in multiple tubular epithelial cells. Viral cytopathic changes with enlarged nuclei and basophilic inclusions are noted. Concurrent plasma polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is $1.2 \\times 10^{4}$ copies per mL.\n\nStarting from fundamental immunopathologic principles that define allograft rejection as an alloantigen-driven T cell–mediated or antibody-mediated injury, and define viral nephropathy as direct pathogen-induced cytopathic injury with accompanying inflammation, determine the most appropriate interpretation of the biopsy to avoid misdiagnosis and select the best initial management. Consider the role of Banff criteria for T cell–mediated rejection (TCMR), the significance of positive SV40 large T antigen staining, and the expected effect of altering immunosuppression versus intensifying it. Choose the single best option.\n\nA.

Diagnose acute antibody-mediated rejection due to microvascular inflammation and treat with plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin, and rituximab; maintain current immunosuppression.\n\nD. Diagnose adenoviral nephritis based on tubular injury and treat with ribavirin; increase mycophenolate mofetil dose to control inflammation.\n\nE.

However, the Banff guidelines explicitly state that such a diagnosis is valid only in the absence of other identifiable causes for the inflammation.\n\n2.  **Evidence for BKPyVN:** The evidence for BKPyVN is overwhelming and pathognomonic:\n    *   **Morphology:** The presence of viral cytopathic changes (enlarged, \"smudgy\" nuclei) is a classic histologic hallmark of polyomavirus infection.\n    *   **IHC:** Positive nuclear staining for SV40 large T antigen in tubular cells confirms a polyomavirus infection at the tissue level (the antibody cross-reacts with BKPyV).\n    *   **Virology:** A plasma BKPyV load greater than $10^4$ copies/mL strongly correlates with active nephropathy.\n    \n3.  **Synthesis:** In this scenario, the viral infection is the primary driver of pathology. The inflammation (i2/t2) is the host's immune response to the virally infected tubular cells, not a primary alloimmune attack on the graft. Therefore, the correct diagnosis is **BK polyomavirus nephropathy**. To diagnose it as TCMR would be a serious error.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Management Strategy\nThe management for BKPyVN is fundamentally opposite to that for rejection.\n- **BKPyVN Pathophysiology:** BKPyV is an opportunistic virus that reactivates and replicates under conditions of excessive immunosuppression.\n- **Correct Management:** The cornerstone of treatment is to **reduce immunosuppression**, typically by lowering or stopping the mycophenolate mofetil first, to allow the host's immune system to clear the virus.\n- **Incorrect Management:** **Increasing immunosuppression** (e.g., with high-dose steroids) is contraindicated as it would fuel viral replication and accelerate graft damage.\n\n### Step 4: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

Diagnose BK polyomavirus nephropathy... reduce immunosuppression and consider an antiviral strategy...**\n- **Analysis:** This option correctly identifies BKPyVN based on the definitive virologic evidence and proposes the correct management strategy: reducing immunosuppression.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. Diagnose acute antibody-mediated rejection...**\n- **Analysis:** There is no evidence for ABMR; C4d is negative and peritubular capillaritis is minimal.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Diagnose adenoviral nephritis... increase mycophenolate mofetil dose...**\n- **Analysis:** The specific IHC and PCR results point to BKPyV, not adenovirus. The proposed treatment of increasing immunosuppression is incorrect.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Diagnose cytomegalovirus (CMV) nephritis... add high-dose steroids...**\n- **Analysis:** The evidence specifically identifies BKPyV, not CMV.

Faced with a suspicion of antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR), you must decide on the most logical and efficient sequence of tests to confirm the diagnosis. This problem requires you to apply your understanding of the underlying immunology—including complement activation, endothelial injury, and donor-specific antibodies (DSA)—to justify the use of C4d staining, microvascular inflammation scoring, serology, and electron microscopy, thereby building a comprehensive diagnostic strategy from the ground up.", "problem": "A patient is 9 months after a deceased-donor kidney transplant. Serum creatinine has risen from 1.2 mg/dL to 2.1 mg/dL over 4 weeks, with new proteinuria of 1.0 g/day. Blood pressure is controlled, and there is no evidence of urinary tract infection. A for-cause kidney allograft biopsy shows capillary-based inflammation without significant interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates or intimal arteritis. Specifically, multiple glomerular capillary loops contain mononuclear cells consistent with endotheliitis, and peritubular capillaries show leukocyte margination; no fibrinoid necrosis or thrombi are identified. The pathologist’s preliminary read raises concern for antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR), but complement component 4d (C4d) staining has not yet been performed, microvascular inflammation has not yet been scored using Banff criteria, and serology for donor-specific antibodies (DSA) has not yet been ordered. Light microscopy does not definitively show double contours of glomerular basement membranes. The laboratory can perform both immunofluorescence (IF) for C4d and single-antigen bead assays for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DSA. Electron microscopy (EM) is available.\n\nYou must decide on a scientifically justified, stepwise workup to confirm or refute active versus chronic/active ABMR in this biopsy. Base your reasoning on fundamental immunology and well-established transplant pathology principles: antigen–antibody binding to endothelium can activate the classical complement pathway, generating covalently bound C4d; microvascular inflammation reflects endothelial injury; serologic DSA identify circulating alloantibodies; and chronic ABMR is supported by ultrastructural remodeling, such as glomerular basement membrane duplication.\n\nWhich option outlines the most appropriate sequence of actions and decision criteria?\n\nA. Order DSA testing immediately and initiate empiric therapy if DSA are detected; perform C4d only if DSA are positive; microvascular inflammation scoring is optional because serology is the determinant of ABMR.\n\nB. First, quantify microvascular inflammation by assigning Banff glomerulitis ($g$) and peritubular capillaritis ($ptc$) scores; second, perform C4d IF on peritubular capillaries to assess antibody–endothelial interaction; third, obtain HLA DSA serology; finally, reserve EM to evaluate for chronicity (e.g., transplant glomerulopathy) if proteinuria and morphologic suspicion persist or if chronic/active ABMR classification is considered.\n\nC. Skip C4d because endothelial transcript assays have fully replaced it; rely solely on an endothelial gene expression panel to prove antibody interaction; perform EM routinely in all suspected ABMR cases regardless of clinical or morphologic features.\n\nD. Perform EM first to look for peritubular capillary basement membrane multilayering and glomerular basement membrane duplication; if these are present, ABMR is confirmed and no DSA testing is necessary.\n\nE.

The key lesions are glomerulitis ($g$ score) and peritubular capillaritis ($ptc$ score). Quantifying these is a mandatory first step.\n\n2.  **Evidence of Antibody Interaction with Endothelium:** This demonstrates that antibodies are actively targeting the graft's blood vessels. The classic method is staining for complement component C4d, a stable footprint of classical complement activation by antibodies. While other molecular tests exist, C4d remains a cornerstone of the diagnostic algorithm.\n\n3.  **Serologic Evidence of Donor-Specific Antibodies (DSAs):** This identifies the circulating effector molecules (the antibodies) in the patient's blood, linking the systemic immune response to the tissue injury.\n\nFor **chronic** ABMR, an additional finding is required: morphologic evidence of chronic endothelial injury, such as transplant glomerulopathy (glomerular basement membrane double contours, best seen on EM) or severe peritubular capillary basement membrane multilayering (also requiring EM).\n\n### Step 3: Construct the Logical Workup\nBased on these principles, the most efficient and logical sequence of actions is:\n\n1.  **Start with the tissue in hand:** First, formally score the existing light microscopy slides to quantify the degree of microvascular inflammation (assigning $g$ and $ptc$ scores). This establishes the presence and severity of the tissue injury.\n2.  **Assess for antibody activity in tissue:** Next, perform immunofluorescence (or immunohistochemistry) for C4d on the biopsy tissue. This directly tests for a key mechanism of antibody-mediated injury at the site of damage.\n3.  **Identify the systemic cause:** Concurrently or sequentially, order serologic testing for circulating HLA DSAs. This confirms the presence of the alloantibodies responsible for the process.\n4.  **Evaluate for chronicity (if needed):** Given the patient's proteinuria and the equivocal light microscopy, electron microscopy (EM) is a justified final step to look for ultrastructural signs of chronic ABMR (transplant glomerulopathy), which is critical for prognosis and classification as chronic/active ABMR.\n\n### Step 4: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Order DSA testing immediately and initiate empiric therapy...**\n- **Analysis:** This approach is flawed. It skips the crucial step of evaluating the tissue evidence (microvascular inflammation), and treatment should not be based on serology alone.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. First, quantify microvascular inflammation by assigning Banff glomerulitis ($g$) and peritubular capillaritis ($ptc$) scores; second, perform C4d IF... third, obtain HLA DSA serology; finally, reserve EM to evaluate for chronicity...**\n- **Analysis:** This sequence perfectly aligns with the logical, evidence-based diagnostic pathway derived from first principles. It starts with tissue analysis, proceeds to test for mechanism, confirms the systemic cause, and uses advanced techniques appropriately to assess chronicity.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. Skip C4d because endothelial transcript assays have fully replaced it...**\n- **Analysis:** This is an overstatement. While molecular assays are valuable, they have not \"fully replaced\" C4d, which remains a key and widely used criterion. Skipping C4d would be a deviation from standard practice.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D.
