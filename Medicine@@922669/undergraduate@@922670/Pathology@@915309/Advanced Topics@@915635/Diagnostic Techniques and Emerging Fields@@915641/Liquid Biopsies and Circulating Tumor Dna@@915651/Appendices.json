The cfDNA extraction efficiency is $\\eta = 0.80$, and the fraction of the cfDNA that is tumor-derived (ctDNA fraction) is $f = 0.015$.

It contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We may therefore proceed with the calculation.\n\nThe objective is to compute the expected number of circulating tumor Deoxyribonucleic Acid (ctDNA) haploid genome equivalents recovered from a plasma sample. We are provided with the following parameters:\n- Plasma volume, $V_{p} = 6.0$ mL\n- Concentration of cell-free Deoxyribonucleic Acid (cfDNA), $C = 12$ ng/mL\n- cfDNA extraction efficiency, $\\eta = 0.80$\n- ctDNA mass fraction, $f = 0.015$\n- Mass per haploid genome equivalent, $m_{GE} = 3.3$ pg\n- Conversion factor, $1$ ng $= 1000$ pg\n\nThe calculation proceeds in a sequence of logical steps.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total mass of cfDNA present in the isolated plasma volume before extraction. Let this mass be $M_{cfDNA, total}$. It is the product of the cfDNA concentration and the plasma volume.\n$$M_{cfDNA, total} = C \\times V_{p}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$M_{cfDNA, total} = (12 \\frac{\\text{ng}}{\\text{mL}}) \\times (6.0 \\text{ mL}) = 72 \\text{ ng}$$\n\nSecond, we determine the total mass of cfDNA that is successfully recovered after the extraction process. This is found by applying the extraction efficiency, $\\eta$, to the total cfDNA mass. Let the recovered mass be $M_{cfDNA, rec}$.\n$$M_{cfDNA, rec} = M_{cfDNA, total} \\times \\eta$$\n$$M_{cfDNA, rec} = (72 \\text{ ng}) \\times 0.80 = 57.6 \\text{ ng}$$\n\nThird, we calculate the mass of ctDNA within the recovered cfDNA. The problem states that the ctDNA fraction, $f$, is a mass fraction. We assume that the extraction process does not preferentially enrich or deplete ctDNA relative to non-tumor cfDNA. Therefore, the ctDNA fraction in the recovered material is the same as in the original sample. Let the recovered ctDNA mass be $M_{ctDNA, rec}$.\n$$M_{ctDNA, rec} = M_{cfDNA, rec} \\times f$$\n$$M_{ctDNA, rec} = (57.6 \\text{ ng}) \\times 0.015 = 0.864 \\text{ ng}$$\n\nFourth, we must convert the mass of recovered ctDNA from nanograms (ng) to picograms (pg) to be dimensionally consistent with the given mass per haploid genome equivalent. Let this mass in picograms be $M_{ctDNA, rec, pg}$.\n$$M_{ctDNA, rec, pg} = M_{ctDNA, rec} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ pg}}{1 \\text{ ng}}$$\n$$M_{ctDNA, rec, pg} = (0.864 \\text{ ng}) \\times 1000 \\frac{\\text{pg}}{\\text{ng}} = 864 \\text{ pg}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the expected number of ctDNA haploid genome equivalents, $N_{ctDNA, GE}$, by dividing the total recovered mass in picograms by the mass of a single haploid genome equivalent, $m_{GE}$.\n$$N_{ctDNA, GE} = \\frac{M_{ctDNA, rec, pg}}{m_{GE}}$$\n$$N_{ctDNA, GE} = \\frac{864 \\text{ pg}}{3.3 \\text{ pg/GE}} \\approx 261.8181... \\text{ GE}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The fourth significant figure is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the third significant figure.\n$$N_{ctDNA, GE} \\approx 262$$\n\nThe entire calculation can be expressed in a single formula:\n$$N_{ctDNA, GE} = \\frac{(C \\times V_{p}) \\times \\eta \\times f \\times 1000}{m_{GE}}$$\n$$N_{ctDNA, GE} = \\frac{(12 \\times 6.0) \\times 0.80 \\times 0.015 \\times 1000}{3.3} = \\frac{72 \\times 0.80 \\times 0.015 \\times 1000}{3.3} = \\frac{864}{3.3} \\approx 261.8181...$$\nRounding to three significant figures yields $262$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{262}$$", "id": "4399492"}, {"introduction": "Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has revolutionized the detection of rare mutations by partitioning a sample into thousands of nanoliter droplets, enabling absolute quantification.

Use the following foundational facts:\n\n- Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma has a short half-life on the order of hours (frequently $< 2$ hours), so circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) reflects current tumor shedding.\n- ctDNA fraction depends on total tumor burden, lesion vascularity and necrosis, and anatomical barriers, and varies by lesion; liver metastases often shed more ctDNA than bone-dominant or intracranial disease.\n- Tumors are genetically heterogeneous across lesions and over time under therapy selection; a single-lesion biopsy samples only one spatial region, whereas plasma aggregates DNA shed from multiple lesions.\n- Assays differ in analytic sensitivity; a mutation present below a tissue assay’s LOD can be missed even if present biologically.\n- Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) contributes mutations from leukocytes to plasma cfDNA, most commonly in genes such as DNA methyltransferase $3$ alpha (DNMT3A), Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase $2$ (TET2), additional sex combs like $1$ (ASXL1), Janus kinase $2$ (JAK2), protein phosphatase, magnesium-dependent $1$ delta (PPM1D), and TP53; RAS gene alterations are less typical but have been reported rarely.\n\nWhich of the following explanations and confirmatory strategies best reconcile the discordant KRAS results and are most appropriate next steps?

The KRAS p.G12D clone is present at low prevalence in one or more lesions and is below the $\\approx 5\\%$ VAF LOD of the liver tissue assay; the single-lesion biopsy missed the subclone due to sampling bias.

The plasma KRAS call is most consistent with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP); repeating the liquid biopsy using serum instead of plasma will reduce leukocyte-derived background and obviate the need for matched white blood cell sequencing.\n\nC.

The task is to identify the best explanations and confirmatory strategies for this discordance.\n\n### Step 1: Validation of the Problem Statement\nThe provided information is extracted and evaluated for validity.\n\n**Givens:**\n- **Patient:** A $59$-year-old male with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma.\n- **Treatment History:** Receiving EGFR-targeted therapy.\n- **Initial Genotype ($18$ months prior):** `RAS` wild-type in primary tumor.\n- **Clinical Status:** Radiographic progression (new liver and pulmonary lesions).\n- **Liquid Biopsy:** Plasma cfDNA genotyping via hybrid-capture NGS.\n- **Liquid Biopsy Results:** `KRAS` p.G12D at variant allele fraction (VAF) $0.8\\%$; `TP53` p.R175H at VAF $1.6\\%$.\n- **Liquid Biopsy Assay LOD:** $\\approx 0.5\\%$ VAF.\n- **Tissue Biopsy:** Core needle biopsy of the largest liver lesion, taken within $3$ days of the plasma draw.\n- **Tissue Histology:** Adenocarcinoma with $\\geq 30\\%$ tumor cellularity.\n- **Tissue Biopsy Results:** `RAS` wild-type; `TP53` p.R175H at VAF $10\\%$.\n- **Tissue Biopsy Assay LOD:** $\\approx 5\\%$ VAF.\n\n**Foundational Facts:**\n1.  Short cfDNA half-life means ctDNA reflects the current tumor state.\n2.  ctDNA shedding varies by lesion.\n3.  Tumors are heterogeneous; plasma aggregates DNA from multiple sites, while a biopsy is a single-site sample.\n4.  Assays have different limits of detection (LODs).\n5.  Clonal hematopoiesis (CHIP) can contribute mutations to cfDNA.\n\n**Validation Verdict:**\nThe problem is **valid**.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The scenario is a classic example in modern oncology and molecular pathology. The development of a `RAS` mutation is a known mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR therapy. The VAFs, assay LODs, and clinical details are realistic.\n- **Well-Posed & Consistent:** The problem is structured to test the understanding of ctDNA biology, assay limitations, and tumor heterogeneity. The data are internally consistent. The `KRAS` VAF in plasma ($0.8\\%$) is above the plasma assay's LOD ($0.5\\%$), making it a valid call. The failure to detect `KRAS` in tissue is consistent with its VAF being below the tissue assay's LOD ($5\\%$). The `TP53` mutation serves as a concordance marker, found in both sample types, anchoring the analysis. The problem is solvable through logical deduction based on the provided principles.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of Solution\nThe central issue is the discordance: `KRAS` p.G12D is detected in plasma cfDNA but not in the contemporaneous liver tissue biopsy.\n\n1.  **Context of Resistance:** The patient is progressing on EGFR-targeted therapy. The emergence of a `KRAS` mutation is the most common and expected mechanism of acquired resistance in colorectal cancer. Therefore, the plasma finding is clinically highly plausible.\n\n2.  **Assay Sensitivity Difference:** There is a tenfold difference in the analytical sensitivity of the two assays.\n    - Plasma NGS LOD: $\\approx 0.5\\%$ VAF.\n    - Tissue NGS LOD: $\\approx 5\\%$ VAF.\n    A mutation present at a true VAF of, for example, $3\\%$ would be detected by the plasma assay (as it contributes to ctDNA) but missed by the tissue assay.\n\n3.  **Tumor Heterogeneity:** Tumors are not monoclonal. Under the selective pressure of therapy, resistant subclones can emerge. This heterogeneity can be:\n    - **Inter-lesion heterogeneity:** The `KRAS`-mutant subclone exists in lesions that were not biopsied (e.g., other liver nodules or pulmonary nodules). The biopsied lesion may be truly `KRAS` wild-type.\n    - **Intra-lesion heterogeneity:** The `KRAS`-mutant subclone is present within the biopsied liver lesion, but constitutes only a fraction of the tumor cells there.\n    The plasma cfDNA is a pooled sample from all shedding lesions (Fact #3). Therefore, it can detect a subclone from any progressing site. A tissue biopsy is a small spatial sample and can easily miss subclones due to this sampling bias.\n\n4.  **Quantitative Analysis:**\n    - The `TP53` mutation is likely a truncal (founder) event, present in all or most tumor cells, as it was confirmed in the tissue. Its plasma VAF is $1.6\\%$. The `KRAS` mutation has a plasma VAF of $0.8\\%$, exactly half that of `TP53`. This quantitative relationship strongly suggests that `KRAS` is a subclonal mutation present in roughly half of the tumor cells that are shedding the `TP53` marker into the blood.\n    - Let's assess the possibility of the `KRAS` mutation being present but missed in the tissue. The `TP53` VAF in tissue is $10\\%$ with $\\geq 30\\%$ tumor cellularity. If the `KRAS` mutation is present in half the number of cells as the `TP53` mutation, its expected VAF in the tissue would be around $10\\% / 2 = 5\\%$. This value is exactly at the limit of detection of the tissue assay, making it very possible to be missed. Alternatively, if the `KRAS` mutation is present in a minor subclone (e.g., $15\\%$ of the tumor cells in the biopsied lesion), its expected VAF would be approximately $(30\\% / 2) \\times 0.15 \\approx 2.25\\%$, which is well below the tissue assay's $5\\%$ LOD. Both intra-lesion heterogeneity (with VAF below LOD) and inter-lesion heterogeneity (absence from the biopsied lesion) are strong explanations.\n\n5.  **Clonal Hematopoiesis (CHIP):** `KRAS` mutations can, although rarely, be associated with CHIP (Fact #5). This is a valid differential diagnosis that must be excluded for a definitive interpretation. The gold-standard method to rule out CHIP is to sequence DNA from a non-tumor source, typically sorted white blood cells (WBCs) or the buffy coat fraction of whole blood.\n\nIn summary, the most probable explanations for the discordance are tumor heterogeneity (either inter- or intra-lesion) combined with the differing sensitivity of the assays. The possibility of CHIP is less likely but must be formally excluded. An analytical false positive from the plasma assay is the least likely explanation.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The KRAS p.G12D clone is present at low prevalence in one or more lesions and is below the $\\approx 5\\%$ VAF LOD of the liver tissue assay; the single-lesion biopsy missed the subclone due to sampling bias. Confirm by applying an orthogonal high-sensitivity assay such as droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to the liver DNA and by considering biopsy of a different progressing lesion.**\nThis option correctly identifies the combination of low subclone prevalence (which could result in a VAF below the tissue assay's LOD) and sampling bias (a key consequence of tumor heterogeneity). The proposed confirmatory steps are entirely appropriate. Using a more sensitive assay like ddPCR on the existing liver biopsy DNA would directly test for low-level presence of the mutation in that sample. Biopsying a different lesion directly addresses the possibility of inter-lesion heterogeneity. This is a robust and logical approach.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The plasma KRAS call is most consistent with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP); repeating the liquid biopsy using serum instead of plasma will reduce leukocyte-derived background and obviate the need for matched white blood cell sequencing.**\nThis option is flawed on multiple grounds. First, given the clinical context of progression on EGFR therapy, acquired tumor resistance is a more probable explanation than coincidental `KRAS` CHIP. Claiming CHIP is \"most consistent\" is an overstatement. Second, and critically, using serum for cfDNA analysis is incorrect. The process of blood clotting to create serum causes lysis of white blood cells, which releases vast quantities of genomic DNA, thereby *increasing*, not reducing, the non-tumor DNA background and any CHIP-related signal. Best practice, as was done in the problem, is to use plasma from cell-stabilizing tubes. Finally, no alternative sample type obviates the need for matched WBC sequencing to definitively rule out CHIP.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Given the short half-life of cfDNA and therapy-driven selection, the plasma KRAS signal likely represents emerging resistance across some lesions; appropriate confirmation includes repeating plasma genotyping in $2$–$4$ weeks to assess VAF trajectory and sequencing matched white blood cell DNA to filter clonal hematopoiesis.**\nThis option correctly frames the plasma `KRAS` finding as a dynamic marker of emerging resistance, reflecting the current biology due to cfDNA's short half-life. The proposed confirmations are state-of-the-art. Monitoring the VAF trajectory is crucial; an increasing VAF would strongly indicate the clone is driving progression. Sequencing matched WBC DNA is the definitive method to exclude the confounding possibility of CHIP. This option outlines an excellent non-invasive management and confirmation strategy.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. The discordance proves the plasma assay is falsely positive for KRAS; the most evidence-based action is to disregard the plasma result and change therapy only if tissue from the index liver lesion later becomes KRAS-positive.**\nThis option makes an unsupported conclusion and proposes a clinically dangerous action. The discordance does not \"prove\" a false positive; it is fully explainable by established biological principles (heterogeneity) and technical differences (assay sensitivity). Disregarding a valid biomarker of resistance detected by a sensitive assay is poor practice and could lead to continuing an ineffective and toxic therapy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Lesion-specific shedding and spatial heterogeneity can explain plasma positivity with a negative biopsy of one lesion; selecting a different, PET-avid progressing lesion for biopsy and correlating with imaging to maximize tumor cellularity are rational confirmatory steps, especially in liver-dominant disease where ctDNA shedding is typically higher than from bone-only disease.**\nThis option correctly highlights spatial (inter-lesion) heterogeneity and differential shedding as a key explanation for the findings, consistent with Facts #2 and #3. The recommended action—a targeted biopsy of a different, metabolically active (PET-avid) lesion—is a logical step to attempt to sample the resistant subclone. The additional context about shedding rates is accurate and relevant. This represents a rational, invasive confirmatory strategy.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nThe correct options are A, C, and E, as they describe scientifically sound explanations and appropriate, complementary investigational strategies.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "4399530"}]}
