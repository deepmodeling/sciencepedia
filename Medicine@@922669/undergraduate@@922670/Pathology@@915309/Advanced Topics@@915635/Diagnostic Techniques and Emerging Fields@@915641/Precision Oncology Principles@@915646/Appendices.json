The pathologist aims to understand how the observed variant allele frequency (VAF) is distorted by tumor purity and tumor ploidy, and to correct it to estimate the cancer cell fraction (CCF) of an actionable mutation. Use the following fundamental base:\n\n- The variant allele frequency is defined as the fraction of sequencing reads that carry the variant, which under unbiased sampling approximates the fraction of mutated alleles among all alleles present in the assayed cell mixture.\n- A tissue sample contains a fraction $p$ of tumor cells and a fraction $1-p$ of non-neoplastic (normal) cells.\n- Normal human cells are typically diploid at autosomal loci, contributing $2$ copies per cell at such loci.\n- Tumor cells may be aneuploid with locus-specific total copy number $C_T$.\n- A somatic mutation may be present in only a fraction $f$ of tumor cells. In each mutated tumor cell, the mutation may affect $m$ copies at the locus (mutation multiplicity), while the remaining copies at that locus in that cell are unmutated.\n\nStarting strictly from these definitions and facts, derive how the mixture of tumor and normal cells and tumor aneuploidy distort the observed VAF for a somatic mutation. Using that derivation, propose a correction method to estimate the cancer cell fraction $f$ in terms of the observed VAF, the tumor purity $p$, the tumor locus-specific total copy number $C_T$, the normal diploid copy number $2$, and the mutation multiplicity $m$.\n\nThen apply your correction to the following scenario: a biopsy has tumor purity $p=0.65$ by histopathological assessment, locus-specific total copy number $C_T=3$ at the actionable gene by copy-number profiling, and an observed VAF $V=0.12$ for a missense mutation with phasing evidence consistent with $m=1$.

The concepts are well-defined and form the basis of many algorithms used in research and clinical practice. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary variables and definitions to derive a unique mathematical relationship and subsequently calculate the desired quantity. The language is objective and precise. The numerical values provided ($p=0.65$, $C_T=3$, $V=0.12$) are realistic for a clinical biopsy sample. The problem does not violate any scientific principles, is not incomplete or contradictory, and is a non-trivial application of the given principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe variant allele frequency, $V$, is the ratio of the number of mutated alleles to the total number of alleles at a specific genetic locus within the entire cell population of the sample. To formalize this, let us consider a representative sample containing a total of $N$ cells.\n\nThe number of normal cells in the sample is $N_{\\text{normal}} = N(1-p)$.\nThe number of tumor cells in the sample is $N_{\\text{tumor}} = Np$.\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of alleles at the locus of interest in the entire sample. This is the sum of alleles from the normal cell population and the tumor cell population.\n- The normal cells are diploid, so each contributes $2$ copies of the allele. The total number of alleles from normal cells is $A_{\\text{normal}} = N_{\\text{normal}} \\times 2 = 2N(1-p)$.\n- The tumor cells have a locus-specific copy number of $C_T$. The total number of alleles from tumor cells is $A_{\\text{tumor}} = N_{\\text{tumor}} \\times C_T = NpC_T$.\n- The total number of alleles_ in the entire sample, $A_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of these two quantities:\n$$\nA_{\\text{total}} = A_{\\text{normal}} + A_{\\text{tumor}} = 2N(1-p) + NpC_T\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the total number of mutated alleles in the sample. By definition, somatic mutations are absent from the normal cells. The mutation is present in a fraction $f$ of the tumor cells.\n- The number of mutated tumor cells is $N_{\\text{mutated\\_tumor}} = N_{\\text{tumor}} \\times f = Npf$.\n- In each of these mutated tumor cells, there are $m$ copies of the mutated allele.\n- The total number of mutated alleles, $A_{\\text{mutated}}$, in the sample is therefore:\n$$\nA_{\\text{mutated}} = N_{\\text{mutated\\_tumor}} \\times m = Npfm\n$$\n\nThe VAF, $V$, is the ratio of the total number of mutated alleles to the total number of all alleles.\n$$\nV = \\frac{A_{\\text{mutated}}}{A_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{Npfm}{2N(1-p) + NpC_T}\n$$\nThe factor $N$, representing the arbitrary total number of cells, cancels from the numerator and denominator, yielding the fundamental relationship:\n$$\nV = \\frac{pfm}{2(1-p) + pC_T}\n$$\nThis equation describes how the observed VAF ($V$) is distorted from the true cancer cell fraction ($f$) by the tumor purity ($p$), tumor ploidy ($C_T$), and mutation multiplicity ($m$).\n\nTo estimate the cancer cell fraction, $f$, we can algebraically rearrange this equation. This constitutes the correction method.\n$$\nV \\left( 2(1-p) + pC_T \\right) = pfm\n$$\nIsolating $f$ gives the correction formula:\n$$\nf = \\frac{V \\left( 2(1-p) + pC_T \\right)}{pm}\n$$\n\nNow, we apply this correction method to the provided scenario data:\n- Tumor purity $p=0.65$.\n- Tumor locus-specific total copy number $C_T=3$.\n- Observed VAF $V=0.12$.\n- Mutation multiplicity $m=1$.\n- Normal cell copy number is implicitly $2$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula for $f$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{0.12 \\left( 2(1-0.65) + 0.65 \\times 3 \\right)}{0.65 \\times 1}\n$$\nWe calculate the terms within the parentheses first:\n$$\n2(1-0.65) = 2(0.35) = 0.7\n$$\n$$\n0.65 \\times 3 = 1.95\n$$\nThe expression in the numerator becomes:\n$$\n0.12 \\left( 0.7 + 1.95 \\right) = 0.12 \\left( 2.65 \\right) = 0.318\n$$\nThe denominator is:\n$$\n0.65 \\times 1 = 0.65\n$$\nNow, we compute the final fraction for $f$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{0.318}{0.65} \\approx 0.4892307...\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to three significant figures.\n$$\nf \\approx 0.489\n$$\nThis result indicates that after correcting for tumor purity and the aneuploid state of the tumor cells at this locus, the mutation is estimated to be present in approximately $48.9\\%$ of the cancer cells in the biopsy.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.489}\n$$", "id": "4434969"}, {"introduction": "Once a targetable mutation is identified, a companion diagnostic test is used to determine a patient's eligibility for a specific therapy, but no clinical test is infallible.

It is well-posed, as a unique solution can be derived from the provided information.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the Positive Predictive Value, $PPV$, which is the probability that a patient truly has the biomarker ($D+$) given that they received a positive test result ($T+$). This is expressed as the conditional probability $P(D+ \\mid T+)$.\n\nWe begin with Bayes' theorem, which states that for two events $A$ and $B$:\n$$P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(B \\mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n\nApplying this theorem to our variables, where $A$ is the event $D+$ and $B$ is the event $T+$, we get:\n$$PPV = P(D+ \\mid T+) = \\frac{P(T+ \\mid D+) P(D+)}{P(T+)}$$\n\nThe terms in the numerator are given directly in the problem statement:\n-   $P(T+ \\mid D+)$ is the sensitivity, $S_e$.\n-   $P(D+)$ is the prevalence, $\\pi$.\n\nSo, the numerator is the product $S_e \\pi$.\n\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T+)$, is the overall probability of receiving a positive test result. This is the marginal probability, which must be calculated by considering all possible ways a positive test can occur. A positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios: a true positive (the patient has the biomarker and tests positive) or a false positive (the patient does not have the biomarker but tests positive).\n\nUsing the Law of Total Probability, we can express $P(T+)$ as:\n$$P(T+) = P(T+ \\cap D+) + P(T+ \\cap D-)$$\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(X \\cap Y) = P(X \\mid Y)P(Y)$, we can rewrite this as:\n$$P(T+) = P(T+ \\mid D+) P(D+) + P(T+ \\mid D-) P(D-)$$\n\nWe can now express each term in this sum using the given parameters:\n-   $P(T+ \\mid D+)$ is the sensitivity, $S_e$.\n-   $P(D+)$ is the prevalence, $\\pi$.\n-   $P(T+ \\mid D-)$ is the probability of a positive test given the biomarker is absent. This is the false positive rate. It is related to the specificity, $S_p = P(T- \\mid D-)$. Since a test result can only be positive or negative for a given disease state, we have $P(T+ \\mid D-) + P(T- \\mid D-) = 1$. Therefore, the false positive rate is $P(T+ \\mid D-) = 1 - S_p$.\n-   $P(D-)$ is the probability of the biomarker being absent. Since the biomarker is either present or absent, we have $P(D+) + P(D-) = 1$. Therefore, $P(D-) = 1 - P(D+) = 1 - \\pi$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the equation for $P(T+)$:\n$$P(T+) = (S_e)(\\pi) + (1 - S_p)(1 - \\pi)$$\n\nNow, we substitute this complete expression for the denominator back into our Bayes' theorem formula for $PPV$:\n$$PPV = \\frac{(S_e)(\\pi)}{(S_e)(\\pi) + (1 - S_p)(1 - \\pi)}$$\n\nThis is the general expression for the Positive Predictive Value in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value using the given data:\n-   $S_e = 0.85$\n-   $S_p = 0.90$\n-   $\\pi = 0.20$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$PPV = \\frac{(0.85)(0.20)}{(0.85)(0.20) + (1 - 0.90)(1 - 0.20)}$$\n\nFirst, calculate the individual terms:\n-   Numerator: $(0.85)(0.20) = 0.17$\n-   Term for false positives: $(1 - 0.90)(1 - 0.20) = (0.10)(0.80) = 0.08$\n\nNow, substitute these back into the equation:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.17}{0.17 + 0.08}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.17}{0.25}$$\n\nPerforming the final division:\n$$PPV = 0.68$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. To express $0.68$ with four significant figures, we add trailing zeros.\n$$PPV = 0.6800$$\n\nThis result means that for a patient who tests positive with this diagnostic, there is a $68\\%$ probability that they truly have the targetable biomarker.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.6800}\n$$", "id": "4435040"}, {"introduction": "Administering a targeted drug is only the first step; its effectiveness hinges on whether it successfully binds to its molecular target within the tumor.

It presents a standard pharmacological calculation followed by a conceptual discussion of transport phenomena in the tumor microenvironment, which is central to precision oncology.\n\nThe problem is addressed in two parts. First, the fraction of occupied receptors in plasma is calculated. Second, the likelihood of achieving similar saturation in the tumor is discussed based on pathological and physiological principles.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Receptor Occupancy in Plasma**\n\nThe interaction between a single-site receptor ($R$) and a ligand ($L$, in this case, the inhibitor) to form a receptor-ligand complex ($RL$) is described by the reversible reaction:\n$$R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$$\nThis reaction is characterized by an association rate constant, $k_{on}$, and a dissociation rate constant, $k_{off}$. At equilibrium, the rate of formation of the complex equals the rate of its dissociation:\n$$k_{on} [R]_{free} [L]_{free} = k_{off} [RL]$$\nwhere $[R]_{free}$ is the concentration of free (unbound) receptors, $[L]_{free}$ is the concentration of free ligand, and $[RL]$ is the concentration of the receptor-ligand complex.\n\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined as the ratio of the dissociation rate constant to the association rate constant:\n$$K_d = \\frac{k_{off}}{k_{on}} = \\frac{[R]_{free} [L]_{free}}{[RL]}$$\nThe problem states that the measured steady-state plasma free drug concentration, $C$, is $50\\,\\mathrm{nM}$. This concentration corresponds to the free ligand concentration at equilibrium, so $[L]_{free} = C$.\n\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R]_{total}$, is the sum of the free receptors and the bound receptors:\n$$[R]_{total} = [R]_{free} + [RL]$$\nThe fraction of occupied receptors, denoted by $\\theta$, is the ratio of the concentration of bound receptors to the total concentration of receptors:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{total}}$$\nTo derive an expression for $\\theta$ in terms of $[L]_{free}$ and $K_d$, we first rearrange the definition of $K_d$ to express $[R]_{free}$ in terms of $[RL]$:\n$$[R]_{free} = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]_{free}}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression into the equation for the total receptor concentration:\n$$[R]_{total} = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]_{free}} + [RL]$$\nFactoring out $[RL]$ on the right-hand side gives:\n$$[R]_{total} = [RL] \\left( \\frac{K_d}{[L]_{free}} + 1 \\right) = [RL] \\left( \\frac{K_d + [L]_{free}}{[L]_{free}} \\right)$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for the fractional occupancy $\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{total}}$ yields the Hill-Langmuir equation for non-cooperative, single-site binding:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[L]_{free}}{K_d + [L]_{free}}$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\nDissociation constant, $K_d = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\nPlasma free drug concentration, $C = [L]_{free} = 50\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for fractional occupancy:\n$$\\theta_{plasma} = \\frac{50\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{10\\,\\mathrm{nM} + 50\\,\\mathrm{nM}} = \\frac{50}{60} = \\frac{5}{6}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal and rounding to four significant figures as requested:\n$$\\theta_{plasma} = 0.833333... \\approx 0.8333$$\nThus, at equilibrium in the plasma, approximately $83.33\\%$ of the target receptors are occupied by the inhibitor.\n\n**Part 2: Discussion of Target Saturation in the Tumor Microenvironment**\n\nThe second part of the problem asks whether near-complete target saturation is likely within the tumor, given the plasma conditions. The calculation above pertains to the plasma compartment. The tumor microenvironment presents significant barriers that typically result in a lower free drug concentration in the tumor interstitium, $[L]_{tumor}$, compared to the plasma, $[L]_{plasma}$. The primary factors, as listed in the problem, are:\n\n1.  **Heterogeneous Perfusion:** Solid tumors are characterized by a chaotic and inefficient vasculature. While some regions near functional blood vessels may be well-perfused, large areas of the tumor mass are often poorly perfused or avascular. This limits the delivery of the drug from the bloodstream into the tumor interstitium, creating a steep concentration gradient. The drug concentration will be highest near the vessels and decrease significantly with distance into the tumor tissue.\n\n2.  **Elevated Interstitial Fluid Pressure (IFP):** The combination of leaky tumor vasculature and inadequate lymphatic drainage leads to a high IFP within the tumor, often approaching the pressure in the microvasculature. This high pressure opposes the bulk flow (convection) of fluid and solutes, including the drug, out of the blood vessels and into the tumor. This further impedes drug penetration.\n\n3.  **Extracellular Matrix (ECM) Binding:** The tumor stroma contains a dense and complex ECM. The drug molecule may bind non-specifically to components of this matrix, such as collagen and proteoglycans. This non-specific binding acts as a sink, sequestering the drug and reducing the concentration of *free* drug available to diffuse further into the tumor and bind to its specific cellular target. Fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is dependent on the *free* drug concentration, not the total drug concentration.\n\n4.  **Drug Efflux by Permeability Glycoprotein (P-gp):** P-gp (also known as MDR$1$) is a transmembrane ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that actively pumps a wide range of xenobiotics, including many anticancer drugs, out of cells. P-gp can be expressed on the cancer cells themselves, reducing intracellular drug concentration. Critically, it can also be expressed on the endothelial cells that form the tumor vasculature (the blood-tumor barrier), actively pumping the drug back into the bloodstream as it tries to cross into the tumor interstitium. This efflux mechanism constitutes a major barrier to achieving therapeutic drug concentrations within the tumor.\n\nGiven these factors, the free drug concentration at the site of the target receptors within the tumor, $[L]_{tumor}$, is expected to be substantially lower than the free drug concentration in the plasma, $C = 50\\,\\mathrm{nM}$. Since fractional occupancy is a monotonically increasing function of the free ligand concentration, a lower $[L]_{tumor}$ will inevitably lead to a lower fractional occupancy, $\\theta_{tumor}$.\n\n\"Near-complete\" saturation is typically understood as $\\theta > 0.90$ or $\\theta > 0.95$. To achieve $\\theta = 0.90$, a free drug concentration of $[L] = 9 \\times K_d = 90\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ would be required. To achieve $\\theta = 0.95$, $[L] = 19 \\times K_d = 190\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ is needed. Since all the discussed biological barriers act to make $[L]_{tumor}  [L]_{plasma}$, and $[L]_{plasma}$ itself only achieves $\\theta_{plasma} \\approx 0.8333$, it is highly **unlikely** that near-complete target saturation is achieved uniformly throughout the tumor. While receptor occupancy might approach $83\\%$ in well-perfused perivascular regions, it will be significantly lower in the majority of the tumor mass, compromising the therapeutic efficacy of the targeted inhibitor.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.8333}\n$$", "id": "4435052"}]}
