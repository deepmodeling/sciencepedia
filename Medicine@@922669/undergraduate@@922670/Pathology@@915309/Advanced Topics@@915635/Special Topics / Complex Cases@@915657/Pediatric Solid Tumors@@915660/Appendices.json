Neuroblastoma is a solid tumor arising from neural crest-derived sympathetic tissue and is among the most common malignancies in early childhood. In population-based epidemiology, the incidence rate is defined as the number of new cases arising per unit time per person at risk. Assume neuroblastoma has an annual incidence of $10$ per $1{,}000{,}000$ children under age $5$, and the country has $5{,}000{,}000$ children under age $5$ continuously at risk during the year. Using the definition of incidence rate and assuming uniform risk across the under-$5$ population and the year, compute the expected number of new neuroblastoma cases in one year. Express the final expected count as the number of cases per year. No rounding is necessary.", "solution": "The principles of this problem are rooted in epidemiology, specifically the definition and application of an incidence rate. The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\nThe incidence rate, which we denote as $R_{inc}$, is defined as the number of new cases of a disease, $N_{new}$, that occur during a specified period of time, $\\Delta t$, within a population at risk, $P$. The relationship is formally expressed as:\n$$ R_{inc} = \\frac{N_{new}}{P \\times \\Delta t} $$\nThe quantity $P \\times \\Delta t$ is known as the total person-time at risk.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n1.  The annual incidence rate of neuroblastoma is $R_{inc} = 10$ cases per $1,000,000$ children-years.\n2.  The population at risk is $P = 5,000,000$ children under the age of $5$.\n3.  The time interval is $\\Delta t = 1$ year.\n\nThe goal is to compute the expected number of new cases, $E[N_{new}]$, over this one-year period. We can rearrange the defining equation to solve for this quantity:\n$$ E[N_{new}] = R_{inc} \\times P \\times \\Delta t $$\n\nFirst, let's express the given incidence rate in a more standard mathematical form. A rate of $10$ per $1,000,000$ is equivalent to a fraction:\n$$ R_{inc} = \\frac{10}{1,000,000} \\frac{\\text{cases}}{\\text{child-year}} = \\frac{10}{10^6} \\frac{\\text{cases}}{\\text{child-year}} = 10^{-5} \\frac{\\text{cases}}{\\text{child-year}} $$\n\nThe population at risk is given as:\n$$ P = 5,000,000 \\text{ children} = 5 \\times 10^6 \\text{ children} $$\n\nThe time interval is:\n$$ \\Delta t = 1 \\text{ year} $$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the rearranged formula for the expected number of new cases:\n$$ E[N_{new}] = \\left( 10^{-5} \\frac{\\text{cases}}{\\text{child} \\cdot \\text{year}} \\right) \\times (5 \\times 10^6 \\text{ children}) \\times (1 \\text{ year}) $$\n\nWe can perform the multiplication of the numerical values and the cancellation of units. The units of \"children\" and \"year\" in the denominator of the rate cancel with the units of the population and time interval, respectively, leaving \"cases\" as the final unit, which is dimensionally correct.\n$$ E[N_{new}] = (10^{-5} \\times 5 \\times 10^6 \\times 1) \\text{ cases} $$\n$$ E[N_{new}] = 5 \\times (10^{-5} \\times 10^6) \\text{ cases} $$\n$$ E[N_{new}] = 5 \\times 10^{6-5} \\text{ cases} $$\n$$ E[N_{new}] = 5 \\times 10^1 \\text{ cases} $$\n$$ E[N_{new}] = 50 \\text{ cases} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the expected count as the number of cases per year. Since the calculation was performed for a time interval of one year, the expected number of new cases in one year is $50$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{50} $$", "id": "4428807"}, {"introduction": "Clinical diagnosis is often a process of weighing evidence for and against several possibilities.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nLet $H_R$ denote the hypothesis that the child has retinoblastoma, and $H_C$ denote the hypothesis that the child has Coats disease. Let $E$ represent the observed evidence, which is the combination of leukocoria and ocular calcification.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the prior probabilities of these two hypotheses:\n$P(H_R) = 0.60$\n$P(H_C) = 0.40$\nNote that $P(H_R) + P(H_C) = 0.60 + 0.40 = 1$, which is consistent with the premise that these are the only two diagnoses being considered.\n\nWe are asked to find the posterior probability of retinoblastoma given the evidence, $P(H_R | E)$. We will use Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$P(H_R | E) = \\frac{P(E | H_R) P(H_R)}{P(E)}$$\nThe term $P(E)$ in the denominator is the total probability of observing the evidence, which can be calculated using the law of total probability by marginalizing over the set of all possible hypotheses:\n$$P(E) = P(E | H_R) P(H_R) + P(E | H_C) P(H_C)$$\nSubstituting this into the Bayes' theorem expression gives:\n$$P(H_R | E) = \\frac{P(E | H_R) P(H_R)}{P(E | H_R) P(H_R) + P(E | H_C) P(H_C)}$$\nThe problem provides \"likelihood ratios\" for each disease, which are to be treated as evidence strengths relative to a common baseline. This means that the conditional probabilities $P(E|H_R)$ and $P(E|H_C)$ are proportional to the given values. Let the given likelihood ratio for retinoblastoma be $L_R = 10$ and for Coats disease be $L_C = 0.1$.

It is free from subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ill-posed structure.

The prior probability of a germline variant is $P(G) = 0.15$.\n2.  The prior probability of not having a germline variant is $P(G^c) = 1 - P(G) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85$.\n3.  The sensitivity of the assay is the probability of a positive test given the germline variant is present: $P(T^+ | G) = 0.95$.\n4.  The specificity of the assay is the probability of a negative test given the germline variant is absent: $P(T^- | G^c) = 1.00$.\n\nFrom the sensitivity, we can calculate the probability of a negative test given that the germline variant is present. This is the false negative rate:\n$$P(T^- | G) = 1 - P(T^+ | G) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\n\nThe problem asks for the posterior probability that the child has a germline variant given the negative test result, which is denoted by $P(G | T^-)$. We apply Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(G | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | G) P(G)}{P(T^-)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, represents the total probability of a negative test result. This can be found using the law of total probability, summing over the mutually exclusive events $G$ and $G^c$:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^-|G)P(G) + P(T^-|G^c)P(G^c)$$\n\nSubstituting the known values into this expression:\n$$P(T^-) = (0.05)(0.15) + (1.00)(0.85)$$\n$$P(T^-) = 0.0075 + 0.85$$\n$$P(T^-) = 0.8575$$\n\nNow we have all the components to calculate the posterior probability $P(G | T^-)$:\n$$P(G | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | G) P(G)}{P(T^-)}$$\n$$P(G | T^-) = \\frac{(0.05)(0.15)}{0.8575}$$\n$$P(G | T^-) = \\frac{0.0075}{0.8575}$$\n\nPerforming the final calculation:\n$$P(G | T^-) \\approx 0.0087463556...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
