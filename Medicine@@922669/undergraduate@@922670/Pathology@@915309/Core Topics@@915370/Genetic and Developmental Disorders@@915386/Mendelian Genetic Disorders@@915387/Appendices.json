The dynamics of $C$ are governed by its rate of production and its rate of clearance.\n\nLet $C(t)$ be the concentration of LDL-C in the plasma at time $t$. The rate of change of $C(t)$ with respect to time, $\\frac{dC}{dt}$, is the difference between the rate of production and the rate of clearance.\n\nThe rate of production is given as a constant, $p$.\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Production} = p\n$$\n\nThe rate of clearance is described by mass-action kinetics. It is proportional to the product of the LDLR density, $R$, and the LDL-C concentration, $C$, with a proportionality constant $k$.\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Clearance} = k R C\n$$\n\nCombining these, we can write the differential equation that governs the concentration $C(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = \\text{Rate of Production} - \\text{Rate of Clearance}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = p - k R C\n$$\n\nAt steady state, the concentration of LDL-C is constant, which means its rate of change with respect to time is zero. Let $C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ be the steady-state concentration.\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0\n$$\n\nSubstituting this condition into the differential equation, we get:\n$$\n0 = p - k R C_{\\mathrm{ss}}\n$$\n\nNow, we solve for $C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ to find the general expression for the steady-state concentration as a function of $p$, $k$, and $R$.\n$$\nk R C_{\\mathrm{ss}} = p\n$$\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{p}{k R}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nNext, we apply this model to a normal individual and a patient with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).\n\nFor a normal individual, the LDLR density is $R_{\\mathrm{normal}}$. The corresponding steady-state LDL-C concentration is $C_{\\mathrm{normal}}$.\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{normal}} = \\frac{p}{k R_{\\mathrm{normal}}}\n$$\n\nFor a patient with heterozygous FH, the LDLR density is reduced. The problem states this is $50\\%$ of normal, and provides the value $R_{\\mathrm{FH}}$. The corresponding steady-state LDL-C concentration is $C_{\\mathrm{FH}}$.\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{FH}} = \\frac{p}{k R_{\\mathrm{FH}}}\n$$\nThe production rate $p$ and the kinetic constant $k$ are assumed to be the same in both individuals, as the primary defect lies in the receptor quantity $R$.\n\nThe final task is to compute the elevation factor $\\alpha$, defined as the ratio of the steady-state concentration in the FH patient to that in the normal individual.\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{FH}}}{C_{\\mathrm{normal}}}\n$$\n\nWe substitute the expressions for $C_{\\mathrm{FH}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{normal}}$ into this ratio:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{p}{k R_{\\mathrm{FH}}} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{p}{k R_{\\mathrm{normal}}} \\right)}\n$$\n\nThe terms $p$ and $k$ are common to both the numerator and the denominator, so they cancel out.\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{1/R_{\\mathrm{FH}}}{1/R_{\\mathrm{normal}}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{normal}}}{R_{\\mathrm{FH}}}\n$$\n\nThis elegantly shows that the relative elevation in LDL-C is inversely proportional to the relative functional LDLR density.\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values for $R_{\\mathrm{normal}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{FH}}$ to calculate $\\alpha$.\n-   $R_{\\mathrm{normal}} = 1.00$\n-   $R_{\\mathrm{FH}} = 0.50$ (which is indeed $50\\%$ of $R_{\\mathrm{normal}}$)\n\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{1.00}{0.50}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha = 2\n$$\n\nThe model predicts that a patient with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, having $50\\%$ of the normal LDLR density, will exhibit a $2$-fold elevation in steady-state plasma LDL-C concentration compared to a normal individual. The provided values for $p$ and $k$ are not necessary for the calculation of the ratio $\\alpha$, but they confirm the consistency of the model setup.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "4404521"}, {"introduction": "While Mendelian rules provide a foundation for predicting inheritance, the expression of a genetic trait can be more complex. This exercise introduces the crucial concept of incomplete penetrance, where individuals who inherit a pathogenic variant may not exhibit the associated phenotype. You will learn how to calculate an empiric recurrence risk directly from clinical observation data, a fundamental skill that demonstrates how real-world evidence is used to refine counseling for families affected by disorders like Marfan syndrome [@problem_id:4404478].", "problem": "A clinical genetics service is counseling families with an autosomal dominant (AD) connective tissue disorder resembling Marfan syndrome. In each family, one parent is a confirmed heterozygote carrying a pathogenic variant (genotype $Aa$) and expresses the phenotype, and the other parent is a confirmed non-carrier (genotype $aa$) with no phenotype. Across $N=240$ offspring from such $Aa \\times aa$ matings, a total of $A=78$ children are clinically diagnosed with the disorder. Assume incomplete penetrance: if a child is a heterozygous carrier of the pathogenic variant, the probability that the child manifests the phenotype is a constant $p$ (the penetrance), independent across children and families. Assume negligible phenocopies and de novo mutations, and that clinical diagnosis is specific for the disorder.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions and laws (definition of penetrance as a conditional probability and Mendelian segregation in autosomal dominant inheritance), derive from first principles an expression for the empiric recurrence risk that the next child of an $Aa \\times aa$ mating will manifest the phenotype, expressed in terms of $A$ and $N$, and then compute its numerical value using the observed counts. Report the final probability as a decimal, and round your final answer to $4$ significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for a derivation of the empiric recurrence risk for an autosomal dominant disorder with incomplete penetrance, based on observed data from specific matings, and then to compute its value. The derivation must be based on first principles.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the problem using the language of probability theory and genetics. The mating is between a heterozygous affected parent ($Aa$) and a homozygous non-carrier parent ($aa$). According to Mendel's first law of segregation, each offspring has a probability of inheriting the pathogenic allele '$A$' from the heterozygous parent. Let $G$ be the event that an offspring has the genotype $Aa$. The probability of this event is $P(G) = \\frac{1}{2}$. Correspondingly, the probability of an offspring having the genotype $aa$ (event $G^c$) is $P(G^c) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe problem states that the disorder exhibits incomplete penetrance. Penetrance, denoted by $p$, is the conditional probability that an individual with the pathogenic genotype will manifest the phenotype. Let $Ph$ be the event that an offspring manifests the phenotype. The penetrance is thus $p = P(Ph|G)$. The problem also specifies that there are negligible phenocopies, which implies that an individual without the pathogenic genotype will not show the phenotype. This translates to $P(Ph|G^c) = 0$.\n\nThe recurrence risk for the disorder is the overall probability that any given child from such a mating will be affected, i.e., $P(Ph)$. We can calculate this theoretical probability, which we will denote by $\\pi$, using the law of total probability:\n$$ \\pi = P(Ph) = P(Ph|G)P(G) + P(Ph|G^c)P(G^c) $$\nSubstituting the probabilities defined above:\n$$ \\pi = p \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{p}{2} $$\nThis theoretical risk $\\pi$ is an unknown parameter, as the penetrance $p$ is not given.\n\nThe problem asks for the *empiric* recurrence risk, which is the estimate of the true risk $\\pi$ derived from the provided observational data. The data consists of a total of $N=240$ offspring, of whom $A=78$ are clinically diagnosed with the disorder. Each offspring represents an independent Bernoulli trial, where \"success\" is defined as the offspring being affected, with a constant probability of success $\\pi$. The number of affected offspring in a sample of size $N$ is therefore a random variable that follows a binomial distribution, $\\text{Binomial}(N, \\pi)$.\n\nTo derive an expression for the empiric risk from first principles, we utilize the principle of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). This principle states that the best estimate for the unknown parameter $\\pi$ is the value that maximizes the probability of observing the given data. The likelihood function, $L(\\pi | A)$, for observing $A$ affected individuals in a sample of $N$ is given by the binomial probability mass function:\n$$ L(\\pi | A) = \\binom{N}{A} \\pi^A (1-\\pi)^{N-A} $$\nTo find the value of $\\pi$ that maximizes $L$, it is mathematically more convenient to maximize the natural logarithm of the likelihood function, the log-likelihood $\\ell(\\pi)$:\n$$ \\ell(\\pi) = \\ln(L(\\pi | A)) = \\ln\\left(\\binom{N}{A}\\right) + A\\ln(\\pi) + (N-A)\\ln(1-\\pi) $$\nWe find the maximum by taking the derivative of $\\ell(\\pi)$ with respect to $\\pi$ and setting the result to zero:\n$$ \\frac{d\\ell}{d\\pi} = \\frac{d}{d\\pi} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\binom{N}{A}\\right) + A\\ln(\\pi) + (N-A)\\ln(1-\\pi) \\right] = \\frac{A}{\\pi} - \\frac{N-A}{1-\\pi} $$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find the critical point:\n$$ \\frac{A}{\\pi} - \\frac{N-A}{1-\\pi} = 0 \\implies \\frac{A}{\\pi} = \\frac{N-A}{1-\\pi} $$\nSolving this equation for $\\pi$:\n$$ A(1-\\pi) = \\pi(N-A) $$\n$$ A - A\\pi = N\\pi - A\\pi $$\n$$ A = N\\pi $$\nThe maximum likelihood estimator for $\\pi$, which we denote as $\\hat{\\pi}$, is therefore:\n$$ \\hat{\\pi} = \\frac{A}{N} $$\nThis expression, representing the observed frequency of affected individuals, is the rigorously derived empiric recurrence risk.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided data: $A=78$ and $N=240$.\n$$ \\hat{\\pi} = \\frac{78}{240} $$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$ \\hat{\\pi} = \\frac{13 \\times 6}{40 \\times 6} = \\frac{13}{40} = 0.325 $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be reported as a decimal rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$ \\hat{\\pi} = 0.3250 $$\nThis value is the empiric recurrence risk, representing the best estimate based on the clinical observations for the probability that the next child of an $Aa \\times aa$ couple will manifest the disorder.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3250}$$", "id": "4404478"}, {"introduction": "Effective clinical practice often involves synthesizing information from multiple sources to arrive at the most accurate conclusion.
