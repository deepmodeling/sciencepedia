It presents a standard scenario in population genetics based on the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) principle, providing sufficient and consistent information to derive a unique, meaningful solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation of genotype frequencies from allele frequencies under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and then a calculation of specific frequencies based on provided data.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental definitions. In a diploid population, for a gene with two alleles at a single locus, let the dominant (wild-type) allele be denoted by $A$ and the recessive (mutant) allele be denoted by $a$. Let the frequency of allele $A$ in the gene pool be $p$ and the frequency of allele $a$ be $q$. Since these are the only two alleles at this locus, their frequencies must sum to unity:\n$$p + q = 1$$\n\nThe Hardy-Weinberg principle states that if a population is large, undergoes random mating, and is not affected by evolutionary forces such as mutation, gene flow (migration), natural selection, or genetic drift, then the allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation.\n\nUnder these conditions, the expected frequencies of the three possible genotypes ($AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$) in the next generation are given by the terms of the binomial expansion of $(p+q)^2$:\n$$(p + q)^2 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$$\nThis equation provides the relationship between the allele frequencies ($p$ and $q$) and the expected genotype frequencies:\n-   The frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype ($AA$) is $p^2$. Individuals with this genotype are phenotypically unaffected.\n-   The frequency of the heterozygous genotype ($Aa$) is $2pq$. Since the disorder is autosomal recessive, these individuals are phenotypically unaffected carriers of the mutant allele. This is the **heterozygous carrier frequency**.\n-   The frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype ($aa$) is $q^2$. These individuals are affected by the autosomal recessive disorder. This is the **expected affected genotype frequency**.\n\nThis completes the first part of the problem, which asks for the derivation of the expected genotype frequencies and their relationship to the underlying allele frequencies.\n\nNext, we use the specific data provided in the problem. The reported incidence of the autosomal recessive disorder is $1/10{,}000$. This incidence corresponds to the frequency of affected individuals in the population, which is the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype, $q^2$.\n$$q^2 = \\frac{1}{10{,}000} = 0.0001 = 1 \\times 10^{-4}$$\n\nFrom this, we can directly infer the frequency of the mutant allele, $q$, by taking the square root of the affected genotype frequency:\n$$q = \\sqrt{1 \\times 10^{-4}} = 1 \\times 10^{-2} = 0.01$$\nThis is the mutant allele frequency.\n\nThe frequency of the wild-type allele, $p$, can then be calculated exactly:\n$$p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$$\n\nThe problem then asks to infer the carrier frequency, $2pq$, using the approximation that the wild-type allele frequency $p \\approx 1$ for rare autosomal recessive conditions. This approximation is justified because $q=0.01$ is small, making $p=0.99$ very close to $1$.\n\nThe exact carrier frequency is $2pq$. Applying the specified approximation $p \\approx 1$:\n$$ \\text{Carrier Frequency} = 2pq \\approx 2(1)q = 2q $$\nSubstituting the calculated value of $q$:\n$$ \\text{Carrier Frequency} \\approx 2(0.01) = 0.02 $$\n\nFor completeness, we can assess the error introduced by this approximation. The exact carrier frequency is $2pq = 2(0.99)(0.01) = 0.0198$. The approximation yields $0.02$. The relative error is $|0.02 - 0.0198| / 0.0198 \\approx 0.0101$, or about $1\\%$. The approximation is therefore quite accurate for this rare allele.\n\nFollowing the problem's instructions, we report the values for $q$ and the approximated carrier frequency. Both must be rounded to four significant figures.\n-   Mutant allele frequency, $q = 0.01$. To four significant figures, this is written as $0.01000$.\n-   Approximated carrier frequency, $2pq \\approx 0.02$. To four significant figures, this is written as $0.02000$.\n\nThe final answer is presented as a row matrix containing these two values in order.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.01000 & 0.02000 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5050440"}, {"introduction": "The diagnosis of an inborn error of metabolism often begins with recognizing a pattern of derangement in routine laboratory tests.

It presents a realistic clinical scenario and asks for a standard calculation and interpretation based on fundamental principles of physiology and chemistry. All necessary data are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental principle of plasma electroneutrality, which states that the total concentration of positive charges (cations) must be equal to the total concentration of negative charges (anions) in the plasma to maintain a net charge of zero. This can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\sum [\\text{Cations}] = \\sum [\\text{Anions}]\n$$\nThese ions can be categorized into those that are routinely measured and those that are not. Let $[MC]$ be the concentration of measured cations, $[UC]$ be the concentration of unmeasured cations, $[MA]$ be the concentration of measured anions, and $[UA]$ be the concentration of unmeasured anions. The electroneutrality equation can then be written as:\n$$\n[MC] + [UC] = [MA] + [UA]\n$$\nIn clinical practice, the major measured cations are sodium ($[Na^{+}]$) and potassium ($[K^{+}]$), and the major measured anions are chloride ($[Cl^{-}]$) and bicarbonate ($[HCO_{3}^{-}]$). Thus, we can specify:\n$$\n[MC] = [Na^{+}] + [K^{+}]\n$$\n$$\n[MA] = [Cl^{-}] + [HCO_{3}^{-}]\n$$\nSubstituting these into the electroneutrality equation yields:\n$$\n([Na^{+}] + [K^{+}]) + [UC] = ([Cl^{-}] + [HCO_{3}^{-}]) + [UA]\n$$\nThe problem statement defines the anion gap ($AG$) as the concentration of unmeasured anions minus the concentration of unmeasured cations. The unmeasured anions ($UA$) typically include albumin, phosphates, sulfates, and, in pathological states like organic acidemias, accumulated organic anions. The unmeasured cations ($UC$) include calcium, magnesium, and some proteins. According to the definition provided:\n$$\nAG = [UA] - [UC]\n$$\nTo derive an expression for the anion gap in terms of the measured ions, we rearrange the electroneutrality equation to isolate the term $[UA] - [UC]$:\n$$\n([Na^{+}] + [K^{+}]) - ([Cl^{-}] + [HCO_{3}^{-}]) = [UA] - [UC]\n$$\nTherefore, the expression for the anion gap, when including potassium, is:\n$$\nAG = ([Na^{+}] + [K^{+}]) - ([Cl^{-}] + [HCO_{3}^{-}])\n$$\nNow, we can compute the value of the anion gap for the patient using the provided serum electrolyte concentrations:\n- $[Na^{+}] = 138$ mEq/L\n- $[K^{+}] = 5.6$ mEq/L\n- $[Cl^{-}] = 98$ mEq/L\n- $[HCO_{3}^{-}] = 9$ mEq/L\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\nAG = (138 + 5.6) \\text{ mEq/L} - (98 + 9) \\text{ mEq/L}\n$$\n$$\nAG = 143.6 \\text{ mEq/L} - 107 \\text{ mEq/L}\n$$\n$$\nAG = 36.6 \\text{ mEq/L}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures, which is $36.60$ mEq/L.\n\nThe final step is to compare this calculated value to the typical reference interval, given as $12$ to $16$ mEq/L, and interpret its significance. The patient's anion gap of $36.60$ mEq/L is substantially elevated, as it is more than double the upper limit of the normal range of $16$ mEq/L. A high anion gap metabolic acidosis indicates the presence of an excess of unmeasured anions in the blood. In the context of an infant presenting with lethargy, vomiting, and tachypnea, this finding is highly consistent with the suspected diagnosis of an organic acidemia. In such an Inborn Error of Metabolism (IEM), a genetic defect in a metabolic pathway leads to the accumulation of organic acids (e.g., propionic acid, methylmalonic acid). These acids dissociate, releasing protons ($H^{+}$) that consume bicarbonate ($HCO_{3}^{-}$), causing acidosis, and leaving behind the corresponding organic anions (e.g., propionate, methylmalonate), which are the unmeasured anions that elevate the anion gap.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{36.60}$$", "id": "5050484"}, {"introduction": "Effective management of many inborn errors of metabolism, such as phenylketonuria (PKU), relies on carefully controlling the intake of specific substrates to prevent their toxic accumulation.
