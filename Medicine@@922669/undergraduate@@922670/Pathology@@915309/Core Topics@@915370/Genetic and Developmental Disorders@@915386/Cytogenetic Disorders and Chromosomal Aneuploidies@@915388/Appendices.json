This fundamental principle, the Lyon hypothesis, states that all but one X chromosome are inactivated in every somatic cell, forming a condensed structure called a Barr body.

In humans, X chromosome dosage compensation operates via inactivation of all but one X chromosome in each somatic nucleus during early embryogenesis (the Lyon hypothesis). Using this principle and without invoking any shortcut formulas, determine the expected number of Barr bodies per somatic nucleus for individuals with the karyotypes $47,XXY$, $47,XXX$, and $47,XYY$. Express your final numerical answers in a single row matrix in the order listed above. No rounding is required and no units are to be reported. Then, briefly explain how mosaicism, such as $46,XY/47,XXY$, could lead to deviations in observed counts across a population of cells while preserving the per-lineage expectation implied by dosage compensation.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on the established Lyon hypothesis for X chromosome inactivation in mammals and uses standard cytogenetic nomenclature for human aneuploidies. The problem provides all necessary information to derive the solution by first principles. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe central principle guiding the solution is the mechanism of X chromosome dosage compensation in human somatic cells, as described by the Lyon hypothesis. This principle states that in any somatic cell with two or more X chromosomes, all but one of these X chromosomes are randomly inactivated. The inactivated X chromosome condenses to form a compact structure visible within the nucleus, known as a Barr body. Consequently, the expected number of Barr bodies, denoted as $N_B$, in a single somatic nucleus is equal to the total number of X chromosomes, $N_X$, minus one. This can be expressed as the relation:\n$$N_B = N_X - 1$$\nThis rule applies irrespective of the number of autosomes or Y chromosomes present in the cell. The single remaining active X chromosome is sufficient for the expression of necessary X-linked genes.\n\nWe will now apply this fundamental principle to each of the specified karyotypes without recourse to any pre-derived formulas.\n\nPart 1: Determination of Barr body count for non-mosaic karyotypes.\n\nCase 1: Karyotype $47,XXY$ (Klinefelter syndrome)\nAn individual with this karyotype has a total of $47$ chromosomes, including two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome. The number of X chromosomes is $N_X = 2$. According to the principle of dosage compensation, one X chromosome will remain active, while the others are inactivated.\nThe number of inactivated X chromosomes, and thus the number of Barr bodies, is:\n$$N_B = N_X - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$$\nTherefore, a somatic cell from an individual with a $47,XXY$ karyotype is expected to contain one Barr body.\n\nCase 2: Karyotype $47,XXX$ (Triple X syndrome)\nAn individual with this karyotype has a total of $47$ chromosomes, including three X chromosomes. The number of X chromosomes is $N_X = 3$. To achieve dosage compensation, one X chromosome remains active, and the remaining ones are inactivated.\nThe number of Barr bodies is:\n$$N_B = N_X - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$$\nThus, a somatic cell from an individual with a $47,XXX$ karyotype is expected to contain two Barr bodies.\n\nCase 3: Karyotype $47,XYY$ (Jacobs syndrome)\nAn individual with this karyotype has a total of $47$ chromosomes, including one X chromosome and two Y chromosomes. The number of X chromosomes is $N_X = 1$. Since there is only one X chromosome, it must remain active to ensure viability. No X chromosome inactivation is necessary or occurs.\nThe number of Barr bodies is:\n$$N_B = N_X - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0$$\nTherefore, a somatic cell from an individual with a $47,XYY$ karyotype is expected to contain zero Barr bodies. This is the same expectation as for a typical $46,XY$ male.\n\nPart 2: Explanation of mosaicism.\n\nMosaicism is the condition in which an individual is composed of two or more cell populations with distinct genotypes, originating from a single zygote. The example given is $46,XY/47,XXY$ mosaicism. This individual possesses a mixture of cells from two different lineages.\n\nThe principle of dosage compensation (the Lyon hypothesis) is preserved and operates independently within each cell lineage according to its specific karyotype.\n1.  For the $46,XY$ cell lineage: The number of X chromosomes is $N_X = 1$. Following the rule $N_B = N_X - 1$, the expected number of Barr bodies in any cell of this lineage is $N_B = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n2.  For the $47,XXY$ cell lineage: The number of X chromosomes is $N_X = 2$. The expected number of Barr bodies in any cell of this lineage is $N_B = 2 - 1 = 1$.\n\nWhen a tissue sample (e.g., from a buccal smear or blood culture) is taken from a mosaic individual, it will contain a mixture of cells from both lineages. A cytogenetic analysis of this mixed population would reveal that some cells have $0$ Barr bodies (those from the $46,XY$ line) while other cells have $1$ Barr body (those from the $47,XXY$ line).\n\nThis leads to a deviation in the observed counts across the total population of cells. Unlike a non-mosaic $47,XXY$ individual where nearly every cell would show $1$ Barr body, the mosaic individual exhibits a bimodal distribution of Barr body counts ($0$ and $1$). The proportion of cells with $0$ versus $1$ Barr body will depend on the relative ratio of the two cell lines in the specific tissue sampled. Thus, while the per-lineage expectation is perfectly preserved (all $46,XY$ cells behave as expected, and all $47,XXY$ cells behave as expected), the overall observation at the organism or tissue level is a heterogeneous cell population with varying Barr body counts.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4352060"}, {"introduction": "While many chromosomal abnormalities lead to disease, some individuals can carry a rearranged but \"balanced\" set of chromosomes and be phenotypically normal. However, this balance can be profoundly disrupted during meiosis, the process of forming reproductive cells. This practice [@problem_id:4351991] explores the critical case of a Robertsonian translocation carrier, requiring you to trace the complex segregation of chromosomes in a trivalent structure to deduce the genetic makeup of potential gametes and the corresponding risk of aneuploid offspring.", "problem": "A phenotypically normal individual is a balanced carrier of a Robertsonian translocation between acrocentric chromosomes $14$ and $21$, denoted $rob(14;21)$. A Robertsonian translocation is a centric fusion of the long arms of two acrocentric chromosomes, yielding a single derivative chromosome $der(14;21)$ and loss of the short arms, which does not disturb dosage of essential genes. Such a carrier has $45$ chromosomes and, with respect to chromosomes $14$ and $21$, possesses one normal chromosome $14$, one normal chromosome $21$, and one $der(14;21)$. During meiosis I, these three centromeres synapse as a trivalent. Use the core facts that meiosis I segregates homologous centromeres to opposite poles, that a trivalent will undergo $2\\!:\\!1$ centromere segregation, and that the derivative chromosome $der(14;21)$ carries one long arm from chromosome $14$ and one long arm from chromosome $21$. Starting from these principles, derive the distinct segregation classes for this trivalent under alternate versus adjacent segregation, enumerate the resulting gamete complements with respect to chromosomes $14$ and $21$, and predict the zygotic outcomes after fertilization by a cytogenetically normal gamete (carrying one chromosome $14$ and one chromosome $21$).\n\nWhich option correctly lists the gamete complements produced by alternate and adjacent segregation in a $rob(14;21)$ carrier and the corresponding possible zygotic karyotypic outcomes after fertilization by a normal partner?\n\nA. Alternate segregation produces gametes carrying either normal chromosome $14$ plus normal chromosome $21$ or $der(14;21)$.

This loss does not affect the dosage of essential genes.\n- **Carrier Karyotype:** Chromosome number is $45$. The complement with respect to chromosomes $14$ and $21$ is one normal chromosome $14$, one normal chromosome $21$, and one $der(14;21)$.\n- **Meiosis I Behavior:** The three chromosomes—normal $14$, normal $21$, and $der(14;21)$—synapse to form a trivalent structure.\n- **Segregation Principles:** Meiosis I segregates homologous centromeres. The trivalent undergoes $2\\!:\\!1$ centromere segregation.\n- **Derivative Chromosome Composition:** $der(14;21)$ contains the long arm of chromosome $14$ and the long arm of chromosome $21$.\n- **Fertilization Condition:** The gametes from the carrier are fertilized by a cytogenetically normal gamete, which contains one normal chromosome $14$ and one normal chromosome $21$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is scientifically sound. Robertsonian translocations are a well-established class of chromosomal rearrangement. The $rob(14;21)$ translocation is one of the most common, and its meiotic behavior, including the formation of a trivalent and subsequent segregation patterns, is a classic topic in human cytogenetics. The description of acrocentric chromosomes, the formation of the derivative chromosome, the carrier's karyotype ($45$ chromosomes), and the clinical irrelevance of the lost short arms (which contain redundant ribosomal RNA genes) are all factually correct.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides clear initial conditions (the carrier's chromosome complement) and specific rules for segregation ($2\\!:\\!1$ for the trivalent). The task is to deduce the logical consequences of these premises, which leads to a unique set of possible gametes and zygotes.\n- **Objectivity:** The language is technical, precise, and free of any subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a standard, well-posed problem in medical genetics that is scientifically accurate and objective. The solution will now be derived from the provided principles.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nLet us denote the normal chromosome $14$ as $N_{14}$, the normal chromosome $21$ as $N_{21}$, and the derivative Robertsonian chromosome as $D_{14;21}$. The carrier's somatic cells contain the set $\\{N_{14}, N_{14}, N_{21}, N_{21}\\}$ replaced by $\\{N_{14}, N_{21}, D_{14;21}\\}$ plus the normal autosomal and sex chromosome pairs.\n\n**1. Trivalent Formation and Segregation in Meiosis I**\nDuring prophase I of meiosis, homologous regions pair. The long arm of $N_{14}$ pairs with the chromosome $14$ portion of $D_{14;21}$, and the long arm of $N_{21}$ pairs with the chromosome $21$ portion of $D_{14;21}$. This forms a trivalent structure involving the three chromosomes: $\\{N_{14}, N_{21}, D_{14;21}\\}$.\n\nThe problem states that this trivalent undergoes $2\\!:\\!1$ segregation. This means that at anaphase I, two chromosomes will move to one pole and the third will move to the opposite pole. There are three possible ways this can occur:\n\n- **Segregation Pattern 1:** $\\{N_{14}, N_{21}\\}$ segregate to one pole, and $\\{D_{14;21}\\}$ segregates to the opposite pole.\n- **Segregation Pattern 2:** $\\{N_{14}, D_{14;21}\\}$ segregate to one pole, and $\\{N_{21}\\}$ segregates to the opposite pole.\n- **Segregation Pattern 3:** $\\{N_{21}, D_{14;21}\\}$ segregate to one pole, and $\\{N_{14}\\}$ segregates to the opposite pole.\n\n**2. Classification of Segregation Patterns**\n\nThese patterns are classified as either alternate or adjacent segregation.\n- **Alternate Segregation:** This pattern produces genetically balanced gametes. It occurs when non-homologous centromeres segregate to the same pole. In this case, **Segregation Pattern 1** is alternate segregation. The two normal chromosomes, $N_{14}$ and $N_{21}$, go to one pole, while the derivative chromosome $D_{14;21}$ goes to the other.\n    - This yields two types of gametes:\n        - Gamete $1$: $\\{N_{14}, N_{21}\\}$ (Normal chromosomal complement for $14$ and $21$)\n        - Gamete $2$: $\\{D_{14;21}\\}$ (Balanced carrier complement)\n\n- **Adjacent Segregation:** This pattern produces genetically unbalanced gametes. It occurs when homologous centromeres segregate to the same pole (e.g., $N_{14}$ and the $14$q-containing part of $D_{14;21}$). **Segregation Patterns 2 and 3** represent adjacent segregation.\n    - From **Segregation Pattern 2**: $\\{N_{14}, D_{14;21}\\}$ vs. $\\{N_{21}\\}$.\n        - This yields two types of gametes:\n            - Gamete $3$: $\\{N_{14}, D_{14;21}\\}$ (Unbalanced: contains genetic material equivalent to two copies of chromosome $14$ long arm and one copy of chromosome $21$ long arm)\n            - Gamete $4$: $\\{N_{21}\\}$ (Unbalanced: nullisomic for chromosome $14$)\n    - From **Segregation Pattern 3**: $\\{N_{21}, D_{14;21}\\}$ vs. $\\{N_{14}\\}$.\n        - This yields two additional types of gametes:\n            - Gamete $5$: $\\{N_{21}, D_{14;21}\\}$ (Unbalanced: contains genetic material equivalent to one copy of chromosome $14$ long arm and two copies of chromosome $21$ long arm)\n            - Gamete $6$: $\\{N_{14}\\}$ (Unbalanced: nullisomic for chromosome $21$)\n\n**3. Zygotic Outcomes after Fertilization**\nFertilization is with a normal gamete containing $\\{N_{14}, N_{21}\\}$.\n\n- **From Alternate Gametes:**\n    - Fertilization of Gamete $1$ ($\\{N_{14}, N_{21}\\}$): Zygote is $\\{N_{14}, N_{14}, N_{21}, N_{21}\\}$. This is a **normal zygote** with $46$ chromosomes.\n    - Fertilization of Gamete $2$ ($\\{D_{14;21}\\}$): Zygote is $\\{N_{14}, N_{21}, D_{14;21}\\}$. This is a **balanced carrier zygote** with $45$ chromosomes.\n\n- **From Adjacent Gametes:**\n    - Fertilization of Gamete $3$ ($\\{N_{14}, D_{14;21}\\}$): Zygote is $\\{N_{14}, N_{14}, N_{21}, D_{14;21}\\}$. This zygote has three copies of the long arm of chromosome $14$. This is an unbalanced karyotype resulting in **Trisomy $14$**. Chromosome number is $46$.\n    - Fertilization of Gamete $4$ ($\\{N_{21}\\}$): Zygote is $\\{N_{14}, N_{21}, N_{21}\\}$. This zygote is missing a chromosome $14$. This results in **Monosomy $14$**. Chromosome number is $45$.\n    - Fertilization of Gamete $5$ ($\\{N_{21}, D_{14;21}\\}$): Zygote is $\\{N_{14}, N_{21}, N_{21}, D_{14;21}\\}$. This zygote has three copies of the long arm of chromosome $21$. This is an unbalanced karyotype resulting in **Trisomy $21$** (Down syndrome). Chromosome number is $46$.\n    - Fertilization of Gamete $6$ ($\\{N_{14}\\}$): Zygote is $\\{N_{14}, N_{14}, N_{21}\\}$. This zygote is missing a chromosome $21$. This results in **Monosomy $21$**. Chromosome number is $45$.\n\nNote that the zygotes for trisomy $14$, monosomy $14$, and monosomy $21$ are non-viable and result in miscarriage. The trisomy $21$ zygote is viable. However, the question asks for zygotic outcomes, which are determined at fertilization, irrespective of subsequent viability.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Alternate segregation produces gametes carrying either normal chromosome $14$ plus normal chromosome $21$ or $der(14;21)$. Adjacent segregation produces gametes carrying either normal chromosome $14$ plus $der(14;21)$ (with its complement being a gamete carrying only normal chromosome $21$), or normal chromosome $21$ plus $der(14;21)$ (with its complement being a gamete carrying only normal chromosome $14$). After fertilization by a normal gamete, these yield, respectively: normal zygote ($46$), balanced carrier ($45$), trisomy $14$/monosomy $14$, and trisomy $21$/monosomy $21$.**\n- The description of gametes from alternate segregation is correct: $\\{N_{14}, N_{21}\\}$ and $\\{D_{14;21}\\}$.\n- The description of gametes from adjacent segregation is also correct, accurately pairing the complementary gametes from each segregation event: $\\{N_{14}, D_{14;21}\\}$ with $\\{N_{21}\\}$, and $\\{N_{21}, D_{14;21}\\}$ with $\\{N_{14}\\}$.\n- The enumeration of zygotic outcomes is correct. Alternate segregation leads to normal and balanced carrier zygotes. The two types of adjacent segregation lead to zygotes with (trisomy $14$ or monosomy $14$) and (trisomy $21$ or monosomy $21$), respectively.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Alternate segregation produces gametes carrying only normal chromosome $14$ or only normal chromosome $21$. Adjacent segregation produces gametes carrying all of normal chromosome $14$, normal chromosome $21$, and $der(14;21)$, or none of these three. After fertilization by a normal gamete, alternate yields monosomy $14$ or monosomy $21$, and adjacent yields trisomy $14$ or trisomy $21$.**\n- The description of alternate segregation is incorrect. It confuses the products of alternate segregation with some of the products of adjacent segregation.\n- The description of adjacent segregation is incorrect. It describes a $3\\!:\\!0$ segregation, which is a rare event not specified by the problem's constraint of $2\\!:\\!1$ segregation.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Alternate segregation produces gametes carrying either normal chromosome $14$ plus $der(14;21)$ or normal chromosome $21$ plus $der(14;21)$. Adjacent segregation produces gametes carrying either normal chromosome $14$ plus normal chromosome $21$ or only $der(14;21)$. After fertilization by a normal gamete, alternate yields trisomy $14$ or trisomy $21$, and adjacent yields a normal zygote ($46$) or a balanced carrier ($45$).**\n- This option incorrectly swaps the definitions of alternate and adjacent segregation. The products listed for \"alternate\" are actually from adjacent segregation, and the products listed for \"adjacent\" are from alternate segregation. Consequently, the predicted zygotic outcomes are also swapped and incorrect.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Alternate segregation produces gametes carrying only $der(14;21)$. Adjacent segregation produces gametes carrying normal chromosome $14$ plus normal chromosome $21$, normal chromosome $14$ alone, or normal chromosome $21$ alone. Only normal and trisomy $21$ zygotes can result because monosomies are never formed.**\n- The description of alternate segregation is incomplete; it omits the normal gamete $\\{N_{14}, N_{21}\\}$.\n- The description of adjacent segregation is incorrect and incomplete. It mixes a product of alternate segregation ($\\{N_{14}, N_{21}\\}$) with some products of adjacent segregation, while omitting the crucial unbalanced gametes that contain the derivative chromosome.\n- The claim that \"monosomies are never formed\" is factually wrong. Gametes that are nullisomic for chromosome $14$ or $21$ are indeed formed through adjacent segregation, leading to monosomic zygotes upon fertilization.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on a rigorous derivation from first principles, Option A is the only one that correctly describes the meiotic segregation products and the resulting zygotic outcomes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4351991"}, {"introduction": "The advent of non-invasive prenatal testing using cell-free DNA has revolutionized screening for aneuploidies like trisomy $21$.

Using the law of total probability, we expand it as the sum of probabilities of a true negative and a false negative:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c) + P(T^-|D)P(D)$$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$P(T^-) = (Spec)(1 - Prev) + (1 - Sens)(Prev)$$\nNow, substituting this expansion back into the Bayes' theorem formula for $NPV$:\n$$NPV = \\frac{(Spec)(1 - Prev)}{(Spec)(1 - Prev) + (1 - Sens)(Prev)}$$\nThis is the required algebraic expression for the negative predictive value.\n\n**Numerical Computation**\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the derived expressions.\nGiven values:\n- $Prev = 0.00125$\n- $Sens = 0.99$\n- $Spec = 0.999$\n\nComputation of $PPV$:\n$$PPV = \\frac{(0.99)(0.00125)}{(0.99)(0.00125) + (1 - 0.999)(1 - 0.00125)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.0012375}{0.0012375 + (0.001)(0.99875)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.0012375}{0.0012375 + 0.00099875}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.0012375}{0.00223625} \\approx 0.5533816$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $PPV = 0.5534$.\n\nComputation of $NPV$:\n$$NPV = \\frac{(0.999)(1 - 0.00125)}{(0.999)(1 - 0.00125) + (1 - 0.99)(0.00125)}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{(0.999)(0.99875)}{(0.999)(0.99875) + (0.01)(0.00125)}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.99775125}{0.99775125 + 0.0000125}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.99775125}{0.99776375} \\approx 0.99998747$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $NPV = 1.000$.\n\nThe computed values are $PPV \\approx 0.5534$ and $NPV \\approx 1.000$. It is noteworthy that even with high sensitivity and specificity, the positive predictive value is only approximately $55\\%$, a direct consequence of the low prevalence of the condition. In contrast, the negative predictive value is extremely high.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.5534 & 1.000 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4352047"}]}
