By correlating these data points, you will learn to distinguish between the most common and clinically significant testicular neoplasms, a foundational skill in surgical pathology.", "problem": "A pathologist is asked to categorize three testicular lesions by integrating clinical context, histomorphology, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The fundamental base for this exercise is that immunohistochemistry detects lineage-specific proteins: lymphoid cells characteristically express leukocyte common antigen (CD45) and B-cell transcription factors, epithelial carcinomas express cytokeratins and organ-specific markers, and germ cell tumors express embryonic or germ cell transcription factors and surface antigens. In addition, epidemiologic and anatomic-pathologic observations provide contextual clues: primary testicular lymphoma is most common in older men and often shows an interstitial growth pattern, seminoma typically presents in younger adults with a homogeneous mass and nests of clear cells separated by fibrous septa with lymphocytic infiltrates, and metastatic carcinoma to the testis occurs in older men and often retains markers of its site of origin.\n\nThree patients are described:\n\n- Patient 1: A 32-year-old man with a painless enlarging intratesticular mass. Gross examination shows a homogeneous, lobulated, tan mass. Histology reveals nests and sheets of large polygonal cells with clear cytoplasm, distinct cell borders, and prominent nucleoli, separated by fibrous septa containing numerous small lymphocytes and occasional granulomas.\n\n- Patient 2: A 68-year-old man with bilateral testicular enlargement and B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss). Histology shows a diffuse interstitial infiltrate of large atypical lymphoid cells rimming and expanding around seminiferous tubules, with frequent involvement of the epididymis and spermatic cord.\n\n- Patient 3: A 74-year-old man with multiple firm nodules in the testis and a prior history of prostatic adenocarcinoma.

The descriptions of seminoma, lymphoma, and metastatic carcinoma are classic and factually correct according to standard pathology literature. The IHC markers mentioned are standard tools for differential diagnosis in this context. The problem adheres to fundamental scientific principles.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It presents three distinct clinicopathological vignettes, each strongly suggestive of a single diagnosis. The question asks for the correct set of IHC profiles corresponding to these diagnoses. A unique and correct answer is derivable from the provided information.\n- **Objective**: The language is objective, technical, and free of bias. All descriptions pertain to observable clinical and pathological findings.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. The data for each patient is sufficient and internally consistent to lead to a probable diagnosis, which can then be confirmed by a specific IHC panel.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution will now be derived by correlating the patient data with pathological diagnoses and their known IHC profiles, followed by an evaluation of each option.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\n**Analysis of Patient 1:**\n- The patient is a 32-year-old male, which is the peak age range for testicular germ cell tumors.\n- The gross appearance (homogeneous, lobulated, tan mass) and histological findings (nests of large polygonal cells with clear cytoplasm, prominent nucleoli, and a septal lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate) are the quintessential features of **classical seminoma**.\n- The expected IHC profile for seminoma is positivity for germ cell markers such as placental alkaline phosphatase (`PLAP`), `OCT3/4` (a transcription factor crucial for pluripotency), and `c-KIT` (`CD117`). Seminoma cells are negative for lymphoid markers (e.g., `CD45`) and generally negative for epithelial markers like pan-cytokeratins (e.g., `AE1/AE3`). They are also characteristically negative for `CD30`, which is a marker for embryonal carcinoma.\n\n**Analysis of Patient 2:**\n- The patient is an older male (68 years old) with bilateral testicular involvement and systemic B symptoms.\n- The histology shows a diffuse interstitial infiltrate of atypical lymphoid cells.\n- This constellation of findings—older age, bilaterality, B symptoms, and an interstitial lymphoid infiltrate—is a classic presentation of **primary testicular lymphoma**, most commonly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).\n- The expected IHC profile for a B-cell lymphoma is positivity for the pan-leukocyte marker `CD45` and B-cell specific markers like `CD20` and `PAX5`. The tumor cells would be negative for GCT markers (`PLAP`, `OCT3/4`) and epithelial markers (`AE1/AE3`).\n\n**Analysis of Patient 3:**\n- The patient is an elderly male (74 years old) with a known history of prostatic adenocarcinoma.\n- The histology shows infiltrative nests and glands, which is consistent with an adenocarcinoma, and a desmoplastic stromal reaction, often seen with metastatic deposits.\n- The most logical diagnosis is **metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma** to the testis.\n- The expected IHC profile for metastatic prostate cancer is positivity for epithelial markers like pan-cytokeratin `AE1/AE3` and, critically, positivity for prostate-specific markers like Prostate-Specific Antigen (`PSA`). The tumor cells would be negative for leukocyte markers (`CD45`) and GCT markers (`OCT3/4`).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**Option A:**\n- **Patient 1 (Seminoma):** `PLAP`+, `OCT3/4`+, `c-KIT (CD117)`+, `CD45`-, `pan-cytokeratin AE1/AE3`-. This profile is the classic and accurate IHC signature for seminoma. The tumor cells are positive for germ cell markers (`PLAP`, `OCT3/4`, `c-KIT`) and negative for lymphoid (`CD45`) and epithelial (`AE1/AE3`) markers.\n- **Patient 2 (Lymphoma):** `CD45`+, `CD20`+, `PAX5`+, `PLAP`-, `OCT3/4`-. This profile is the classic and accurate IHC signature for a B-cell lymphoma. The tumor cells are positive for pan-leukocyte (`CD45`) and B-cell (`CD20`, `PAX5`) markers, and negative for germ cell markers.\n- **Patient 3 (Metastatic Prostate Ca):** `AE1/AE3`+, `Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)`+, `CD45`-, `OCT3/4`-. This profile is the classic and accurate IHC signature for metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor cells are positive for epithelial (`AE1/AE3`) and prostate-specific (`PSA`) markers, and negative for leukocyte (`CD45`) and germ cell (`OCT3/4`) markers.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option perfectly aligns the clinicopathological diagnosis with the correct IHC profile for all three patients.\n\n**Option B:**\n- **Patient 1:** States `PLAP`- and `OCT3/4`-, which is incorrect for seminoma. `CD30`+ and `AE1/AE3`+ are characteristic of embryonal carcinoma, not seminoma.\n- **Patient 2:** States `CD45`- and `AE1/AE3`+, which is incorrect for lymphoma. Lymphoma must be `CD45`+.\n- **Patient 3:** States `CD45`+ and `CD20`+, which is the profile for a B-cell lymphoma, contradicting the patient's history and glandular histology.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C:**\n- **Patient 1:** States `CD20`+ and `CD45`+, which is incorrect for seminoma cells. This profile indicates a lymphoid process. `SALL4` is a correct marker for seminoma, but its pairing with lymphoid markers for the primary tumor cells is incorrect.\n- **Patient 2:** States `PLAP`+, `OCT3/4`+, `c-KIT`+, which is the profile for a seminoma, contradicting the clinical and histological evidence for lymphoma.\n- **Patient 3:** This option incorrectly assumes a history of urothelial carcinoma and lists `GATA3` as a marker. The problem explicitly states a history of prostatic adenocarcinoma. This option contradicts the provided givens.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D:**\n- **Patient 1:** States `CD30`+, which is not characteristic of classic seminoma; it is a marker for embryonal carcinoma.\n- **Patient 2:** States `AE1/AE3`+, which is an epithelial marker. The co-expression of lymphoid markers and cytokeratin is not a feature of testicular lymphoma.\n- **Patient 3:** States `PSA`- and `OCT3/4`+. This is highly illogical. A metastasis from a known prostatic adenocarcinoma would be expected to be `PSA`+. An `OCT3/4`+ result would indicate a GCT, which is inconsistent with the patient's age, history, and glandular histology.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, only Option A provides the correct and classic IHC profiles that correspond to the diagnoses suggested by the clinical and histological findings for each of the three patients.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4457186"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis of a malignant germ cell tumor is established, the next critical task is to determine the patient's prognosis and guide subsequent therapy.

He undergoes radical orchiectomy. Histopathology reveals a mixed nonseminomatous germ cell tumor composed of embryonal carcinoma and yolk sac tumor with lymphovascular invasion; the tumor measures 3.8 cm and is confined to the testis and epididymis without spermatic cord or scrotal involvement. Post-orchiectomy serum tumor markers at 14 days are: alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) = 760 ng/mL, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) = 900 IU/L, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) = 260 U/L. The local laboratory upper limits of normal (ULN) are AFP ULN = 10 ng/mL, hCG ULN = 5 IU/L, and LDH ULN = 220 U/L. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen shows multiple retroperitoneal lymph nodes, with the largest short-axis diameter = 3.1 cm. Computed tomography of the chest shows no pulmonary metastases; there are no nonpulmonary visceral metastases (e.g., no liver, brain, or bone lesions).\n\nUsing foundational facts about testicular germ cell tumor staging and risk stratification:\n\n- The Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) incorporates a serum marker category $S$ defined post-orchiectomy, where $S1$ corresponds to all of the following: AFP  1000 ng/mL, hCG  5000 IU/L, and LDH  1.5 × ULN; nodal categories are $N1$ for metastases ≤ 2 cm, $N2$ for metastases > 2 cm but ≤ 5 cm, and $N3$ for metastases > 5 cm, with $M0$ indicating no distant metastasis.

It requires the direct application of provided clinical staging and risk stratification rules to a set of patient data. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or missing information. The problem is valid.\n\n**Step 2: Determine AJCC Group Stage**\n\nWe must determine the patient's N, M, and S categories to find the group stage.\n- **N (Nodal) Category:** The patient has retroperitoneal lymph node metastases, with the largest measuring 3.1 cm in short-axis diameter. According to the provided definitions, this falls into the $N2$ category, as 2 cm  3.1 cm ≤ 5 cm.\n- **M (Metastasis) Category:** The CT scans show no pulmonary or nonpulmonary visceral metastases. This corresponds to the $M0$ category.\n- **S (Serum Marker) Category:** We evaluate the post-orchiectomy serum markers against the $S1$ criteria.\n  1.  AFP: The patient's level is 760 ng/mL. The criterion for $S1$ is AFP  1000 ng/mL. Since 760  1000, this condition is met.\n  2.  hCG: The patient's level is 900 IU/L. The criterion for $S1$ is hCG  5000 IU/L. Since 900  5000, this condition is met.\n  3.  LDH: The patient's level is 260 U/L. The criterion for $S1$ is LDH  1.5 × ULN. The LDH ULN is given as 220 U/L. We calculate the threshold: 1.5 × 220 = 330 U/L. Since the patient's LDH of 260 U/L is less than 330 U/L, this condition is also met.\n  Since all three marker conditions are satisfied, the patient's marker stage is $S1$.\n- **Group Stage:** The patient's full staging profile for this purpose is (any $T$, $N2$, $M0$, $S1$). According to the definitions provided:\n  - Stage $IIA$: any $T$, $N1$, $M0$, $S0$–$S1$\n  - Stage $IIB$: any $T$, $N2$, $M0$, $S0$–$S1$\n  - Stage $IIC$: any $T$, $N3$, $M0$, $S0$–$S1$\nThe patient's profile matches the criteria for **Stage $IIB$**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine IGCCCG Risk Group**\n\nThe patient has a nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT) with a testicular primary and no nonpulmonary visceral metastases. We apply the IGCCCG criteria for this scenario.\n- **“Good” Risk Criteria:** Requires AFP  1000 ng/mL AND hCG  5000 IU/L AND LDH  1.5 × ULN.\n  - Patient's AFP is 760 ng/mL, which is  1000 ng/mL.\n  - Patient's hCG is 900 IU/L, which is  5000 IU/L.\n  - Patient's LDH is 260 U/L, which is  1.5 × 220 = 330 U/L.\nAll conditions for “Good” risk are met. Therefore, the patient is in the **Good** risk group. There is no need to check Intermediate or Poor risk categories, as the criteria are mutually exclusive.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Composite Value $C$**\n\nWe now assign the numerical codes and compute the final value.\n- **Stage Code ($s$):** The patient is Stage $IIB$. The problem states to use $s=3$ for Stage $IIB$. Thus, $s=3$.\n- **Risk Code ($r$):** The patient is in the Good risk group. The problem states to use $r=1$ for Good risk.
