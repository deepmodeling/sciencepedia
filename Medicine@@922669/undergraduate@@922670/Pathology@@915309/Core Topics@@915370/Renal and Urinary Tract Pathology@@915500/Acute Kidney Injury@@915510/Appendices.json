Serum creatinine accumulation is a lagging indicator of reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), while urine output can reflect both GFR and tubular function. In this initial phase, the renal injury was sufficient to impair creatinine clearance (elevating SCr), but not severe enough to reduce urine volume below the oliguric threshold defined by KDIGO. This discordance is common in clinical practice, as the two parameters do not always change in perfect synchrony.

A unique and meaningful solution can be derived from the provided information.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part response: the derivation of an expression for the fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa), the calculation of FeNa for the given patient data, and the pathophysiological interpretation of the result.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the FeNa Expression**\n\nThe fractional excretion of sodium, $F_eNa$, is defined as the fraction of the sodium filtered by the glomeruli that is ultimately excreted in the urine. This can be expressed as the ratio of the rate of sodium excretion to the rate of sodium filtration:\n$$ F_eNa = \\frac{\\text{Sodium Excreted}}{\\text{Sodium Filtered}} $$\n\nWe will formalize the numerator and denominator using the provided foundational facts.\n\nLet $U_{Na}$ be the urine sodium concentration and $P_{Na}$ be the plasma sodium concentration.\nLet $V$ be the urine flow rate.\n\nAccording to the first principle provided, the excreted load (or rate of excretion) of a solute equals its urine concentration multiplied by the urine flow rate. For sodium, this is:\n$$ \\text{Sodium Excreted} = U_{Na} \\times V $$\n\nAccording to the second principle, the filtered load of a freely filtered solute equals the glomerular filtration rate ($GFR$) multiplied by its plasma concentration. Sodium is freely filtered. Therefore:\n$$ \\text{Sodium Filtered} = P_{Na} \\times GFR $$\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the definition of $F_eNa$:\n$$ F_eNa = \\frac{U_{Na} \\times V}{P_{Na} \\times GFR} $$\n\nThe urine flow rate $V$ and the $GFR$ are not directly provided. However, the third principle states that in a steady state, $GFR$ can be approximated by the clearance of creatinine ($C_{Cr}$), as creatinine is freely filtered and undergoes negligible tubular secretion or reabsorption.\n\nThe clearance of any substance $x$ is defined as the volume of plasma from which the substance is completely removed per unit time. It is calculated as:\n$$ C_x = \\frac{U_x \\times V}{P_x} $$\nwhere $U_x$ is the urine concentration and $P_x$ is the plasma concentration of the substance.\n\nApplying this definition to creatinine, with $U_{Cr}$ as the urine creatinine concentration and $P_{Cr}$ as the plasma creatinine concentration, we get the creatinine clearance:\n$$ C_{Cr} = \\frac{U_{Cr} \\times V}{P_{Cr}} $$\n\nUsing the approximation $GFR \\approx C_{Cr}$, we can write:\n$$ GFR \\approx \\frac{U_{Cr} \\times V}{P_{Cr}} $$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $GFR$ into our equation for $F_eNa$:\n$$ F_eNa = \\frac{U_{Na} \\times V}{P_{Na} \\times \\left( \\frac{U_{Cr} \\times V}{P_{Cr}} \\right)} $$\n\nThe urine flow rate, $V$, appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it can be canceled out:\n$$ F_eNa = \\frac{U_{Na}}{P_{Na} \\times \\left( \\frac{U_{Cr}}{P_{Cr}} \\right)} $$\n\nRearranging this expression gives the final, practical formula for $F_eNa$:\n$$ F_eNa = \\frac{U_{Na} \\times P_{Cr}}{P_{Na} \\times U_{Cr}} $$\n\nThis derived expression relates the four provided laboratory values ($U_{Na}$, $P_{Na}$, $U_{Cr}$, and $P_{Cr}$) and allows for the calculation of $F_eNa$ from a single spot urine sample and a contemporaneous blood sample, without needing a timed urine collection to measure $V$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of FeNa**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Plasma sodium concentration: $P_{Na} = 142 \\text{ mmol/L}$\n- Urine sodium concentration: $U_{Na} = 8 \\text{ mmol/L}$\n- Plasma creatinine concentration: $P_{Cr} = 2.1 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n- Urine creatinine concentration: $U_{Cr} = 98 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n\nUsing the derived formula:\n$$ F_eNa = \\frac{U_{Na} \\times P_{Cr}}{P_{Na} \\times U_{Cr}} $$\n\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ F_eNa = \\frac{(8 \\text{ mmol/L}) \\times (2.1 \\text{ mg/dL})}{(142 \\text{ mmol/L}) \\times (98 \\text{ mg/dL})} $$\n\nThe units (mmol/L and mg/dL) cancel, yielding a dimensionless number as expected for a fraction.\n$$ F_eNa = \\frac{16.8}{13916} \\approx 0.00120724346... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

The fourth significant digit is $7$, which is $\\ge 5$, so we round up the third significant digit.\n$$ F_eNa \\approx 0.00121 $$\n\n**Part 3: Pathophysiologic Interpretation**\n\nThe fractional excretion of sodium is a critical tool for differentiating between the major categories of acute kidney injury (AKI), specifically between prerenal azotemia and intrinsic AKI, particularly acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The interpretation relies on understanding the kidney's physiological response to different insults.\n\nEstablished clinical thresholds for $F_eNa$ (expressed as a percentage) are:\n- $F_eNa  1\\%$ (or as a fraction, $F_eNa  0.01$): This is characteristic of **prerenal azotemia**. In prerenal states, such as hypovolemia from gastrointestinal losses, renal perfusion is decreased. The kidneys perceive this as a loss of effective circulating volume and activate compensatory mechanisms, primarily the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Aldosterone acts on the distal tubules and collecting ducts to increase the reabsorption of sodium (and water). The renal tubules are structurally and functionally intact, and their avid reabsorption of sodium leads to a very low concentration of sodium in the urine relative to the amount filtered.\n- $F_eNa  2\\%$ (or as a fraction, $F_eNa  0.02$): This is characteristic of **intrinsic AKI**, most commonly acute tubular necrosis (ATN). In ATN, the tubular epithelial cells are damaged. This damage impairs their ability to reabsorb solutes, including sodium. Consequently, a larger fraction of the filtered sodium is \"wasted\" into the urine, leading to a high $F_eNa$.\n\nThe calculated $F_eNa$ for this patient is $0.00121$.\nTo compare this with the standard thresholds, we can express it as a percentage: $0.00121 \\times 100\\% = 0.121\\%$.\n\nThis value of $0.121\\%$ is significantly less than the $1\\%$ threshold. This very low $F_eNa$ indicates that the renal tubules are aggressively conserving sodium, a hallmark of an intact tubular system responding to perceived volume depletion. This finding is highly consistent with the clinical history of acute kidney injury developing after gastrointestinal fluid losses.\n\nTherefore, the likely mechanism of AKI in this patient is **prerenal azotemia** secondary to hypovolemia. The kidney itself is not damaged; its function is impaired due to inadequate perfusion. This distinction is crucial as prerenal AKI is often reversible with restoration of fluid volume, whereas intrinsic AKI represents structural damage to the kidney parenchyma. The provided data strongly suggest the former case.

The differentiation between prerenal AKI (a functional, hemodynamic issue) and intrinsic AKI (structural damage, commonly acute tubular necrosis or ATN) is a critical diagnostic step. The use of a volume challenge with isotonic crystalloid to restore renal perfusion and monitor the response via urine output, FeNa, and serum creatinine is the standard of care.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, providing a clear basis for evaluating the provided options. I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe goal is to differentiate prerenal AKI from intrinsic AKI. The pathophysiology of each condition dictates the response to a volume challenge.\n\n1.  **Pathophysiology of Prerenal AKI**: This condition arises from decreased renal perfusion (hypovolemia, decreased effective circulating volume). The kidney parenchyma is structurally intact. In response to perceived volume depletion, the kidney activates compensatory mechanisms, primarily the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) and Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH). This leads to:\n    *   Intense renal vasoconstriction (preferentially of the efferent arteriole) to maintain Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR).\n    *   Avid reabsorption of sodium and water by the renal tubules.\n    *   **Resulting laboratory findings**: Low urine output (oliguria), concentrated urine, low urine sodium concentration ($U_{Na}$), and a Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FeNa) typically less than $1\\%$. The formula for FeNa is $FeNa = \\frac{U_{Na} \\times P_{Cr}}{P_{Na} \\times U_{Cr}} \\times 100\\%$, where $U$ denotes urine concentration and $P$ denotes plasma concentration of sodium ($Na$) and creatinine ($Cr$).\n\n2.  **Pathophysiology of Intrinsic AKI (specifically Acute Tubular Necrosis, ATN)**: This condition involves structural damage to the renal tubules, often from prolonged ischemia or nephrotoxins. The damaged tubular cells lose their ability to function properly. This leads to:\n    *   Impaired reabsorption of sodium and water.\n    *   Obstruction of tubules by cellular debris, leading to reduced GFR.\n    *   Back-leak of filtrate across the damaged tubular epithelium.\n    *   **Resulting laboratory findings**: Urine output may be low or normal, but the tubules cannot concentrate the urine or reabsorb sodium effectively. This results in a high urine sodium concentration and an FeNa typically greater than $2\\%$.\n\n3.  **The Volume Challenge**: A properly designed volume challenge aims to restore renal perfusion.\n    *   **Fluid**: Isotonic crystalloid (e.g., $0.9\\%$ NaCl or a balanced salt solution) is the standard choice because it effectively expands the intravascular volume. Hypotonic solutions like $5\\%$ dextrose in water (D5W) are inappropriate as they distribute primarily into the intracellular space. Colloids like albumin are second-line agents for specific indications.\n    *   **Dose  Rate**: A standard challenge consists of a bolus delivered over a relatively short period, for instance, $10-20\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg}$ over $30-60\\,\\mathrm{minutes}$. This is sufficient to test for volume responsiveness without being excessively aggressive, which could cause volume overload.\n    *   **Exclusion of Confounders**: Diuretics, particularly loop diuretics like furosemide, block sodium reabsorption and will artificially elevate the FeNa, rendering it useless for differentiating prerenal from intrinsic causes. Any valid protocol must exclude their concurrent use.\n\n4.  **Expected Response to the Volume Challenge**:\n    *   **In Prerenal AKI**: Restoring perfusion with a fluid bolus will reverse the stimulus for RAAS and ADH activation.\n        -   **Urine Output**: Should increase promptly and significantly (e.g., to $0.5\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg/h}$) as GFR improves and the hormonal drive for water retention ceases. This response is expected within $1-2\\,\\mathrm{hours}$.\n        -   **FeNa**: Will remain low ($1\\%$) acutely. The tubular machinery for sodium reabsorption is intact and does not \"turn off\" instantaneously. While it may rise slightly, it will not cross the threshold to $2\\%$.\n        -   **Serum Creatinine**: With improved GFR, serum creatinine will stop rising and begin to fall. Due to its volume of distribution and clearance kinetics, this change is not immediate and is typically observed over $6-24\\,\\mathrm{hours}$.\n    *   **In Intrinsic AKI (ATN)**: The kidney's structural damage prevents a normal response to restored perfusion.\n        -   **Urine Output**: Will show little or no increase because the damaged tubules cannot produce more urine.\n        -   **FeNa**: Will remain high ($2\\%$) because the tubules are incapable of reabsorbing sodium.\n        -   **Serum Creatinine**: Will continue to rise as GFR remains low and creatinine is not being effectively cleared. A rise of $\\ge 0.3\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ in a $24$-hour period is a clinically relevant sign of ongoing injury.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Administer isotonic crystalloid at $10$–$20\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg}$ over $30$–$60\\,\\mathrm{min}$; measure urine output hourly for $4\\,\\mathrm{h}$; obtain serum and urine electrolytes and creatinine at baseline and again at $2$–$4\\,\\mathrm{h}$. Expect prerenal AKI to show an increase in urine output to $0.5$–$1.0\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg/h}$ within $1$–$2\\,\\mathrm{h}$, FeNa remaining $1\\%$ acutely (possibly rising modestly but staying below this threshold), and serum creatinine stabilizing or beginning to decline within $6$–$24\\,\\mathrm{h}$.

Administer hypotonic dextrose water ($5\\%$ dextrose in water) at $20\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg}$ over $15\\,\\mathrm{min}$; check urine output once at $30\\,\\mathrm{min}$ and repeat labs immediately. Expect prerenal AKI to show a rapid increase in FeNa to $2\\%$ with brisk diuresis and no change in serum creatinine; expect intrinsic AKI to show FeNa $1\\%$ due to impaired tubular sodium excretion and unchanged urine output.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: This option has multiple critical flaws.\n    1.  **Fluid Choice**: Hypotonic D5W is an improper fluid for intravascular volume expansion.\n    2.  **Monitoring Window**: A single check at $30\\,\\mathrm{minutes}$ is insufficient.\n    3.  **Prerenal Prediction**: It incorrectly states that FeNa will increase to $2\\%$. The expected response is for FeNa to remain low ($1\\%$).\n    4.  **Intrinsic Prediction**: It incorrectly states that FeNa will be $1\\%$. The hallmark of ATN is an FeNa $2\\%$. It also misstates the pathophysiology as \"impaired tubular sodium excretion\" when the problem is impaired *reabsorption*.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Administer $250\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ of $5\\%$ albumin over $2\\,\\mathrm{h}$; obtain serum and urine electrolytes and creatinine at baseline and at the end of infusion; monitor urine output every $2\\,\\mathrm{h}$. Expect prerenal AKI to show no immediate urine output change but a jump in FeNa to $2\\%$ by the end of infusion and a decrease in serum creatinine within $2\\,\\mathrm{h}$; expect intrinsic AKI to show increased urine output due to oncotic expansion with FeNa $1\\%$.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: This option is flawed in its protocol and predictions.\n    1.  **Protocol**: A $250\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ volume over $2\\,\\mathrm{hours}$ is an inadequate challenge. Albumin is not the first-line fluid.\n    2.  **Prerenal Prediction**: It incorrectly states there will be no urine output change and that FeNa will jump to $2\\%$. Both are the opposite of the expected response. A decrease in serum creatinine within $2\\,\\mathrm{h}$ is also physiologically implausible.\n    3.  **Intrinsic Prediction**: It incorrectly states that urine output will increase and FeNa will be $1\\%$. Both are the opposite of the expected response.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Administer isotonic saline at $30\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg}$ over $10\\,\\mathrm{min}$ followed by intravenous furosemide $40\\,\\mathrm{mg}$; measure urine output hourly for $2\\,\\mathrm{h}$; obtain FeNa at $1\\,\\mathrm{h}$. Expect prerenal AKI to show an increase in urine output with FeNa rising to $2\\%$ and serum creatinine decreasing immediately; expect intrinsic AKI to show an increase in urine output from diuretic effect with FeNa uninterpretable but presumed $1\\%$.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: This option introduces a fatal flaw.\n    1.  **Protocol**: The inclusion of furosemide violates the problem's explicit constraint to \"avoid confounders that invalidate FeNa\". Furosemide forces sodium excretion, artificially elevating FeNa and making it diagnostically useless for this purpose. The fluid bolus is also large and excessively rapid ($30\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg}$ in $10\\,\\mathrm{min}$).\n    2.  **Prerenal Prediction**: The FeNa increase is a drug effect, not a diagnostic sign. An immediate decrease in creatinine is incorrect.\n    3.  **Intrinsic Prediction**: While correctly stating FeNa is uninterpretable, it incorrectly presumes it would be $1\\%$; the baseline FeNa is high in ATN, and the diuretic would only increase it further.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4759816"}]}
