This exercise [@problem_id:4321891] challenges you to apply these evidence-based rules to a common clinical scenario, integrating your understanding of diagnostic test performance metrics like negative predictive value (NPV).", "problem": "A $35$-year-old individual whose parent has Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) presents for screening. High-quality renal ultrasonography with complete visualization of both kidneys shows a single, simple cortical cyst measuring $1.5\\,\\text{cm}$; renal size, echogenicity, and parenchyma are otherwise normal, and no additional renal or extrarenal cysts are identified. Assume the pretest probability of disease is $50\\%$ (first-degree relative of an affected individual), and that validated, age-stratified ultrasound criteria for ADPKD in at-risk individuals have been established in large cohorts. Use the core definitions of test performance, including sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value (NPV), together with the fact that cyst burden in ADPKD increases with age and that incidental simple renal cysts become more common in the general population with age, to derive a decision rule for exclusion of ADPKD in this case and justify the NPV of that rule. Which option best states the correct decision rule and the most accurate justification of its NPV?\n\nA. Declare the ultrasound a negative screen for ADPKD because, in at-risk individuals aged $30$-$39$, a finding of $\\leq 1$ renal cyst is a validated exclusion criterion; the NPV is approximately $96\\%$ to $100\\%$ (near $100\\%$ for Polycystic Kidney Disease $1$ (PKD1)), reducing the post-test probability of ADPKD to at most a few percent.\n\nB.

The principles of sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value (NPV) are to be used. The facts that cyst burden in ADPKD increases with age and incidental cysts also increase with age in the general population are to be considered.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard scenario in medical genetics and nephrology. The provided information is internally consistent and aligns with known facts about ADPKD pathology and diagnosis. The problem implicitly requires knowledge of the established diagnostic criteria (e.g., the Pei-Ravine criteria), which is a reasonable expectation in a specialized context. The problem is not flawed.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the detailed solution.\n\n**Derivation of Decision Rule and NPV**\n\nThe problem requires applying validated, age-stratified ultrasound criteria to a $35$-year-old at-risk individual. The most widely accepted criteria are the unified Pei criteria (Pei et al., J Am Soc Nephrol, 2009).\n\n1.  **Identify the Correct Diagnostic/Exclusion Criteria**:\n    - For an at-risk individual aged $15-39$ years, a diagnosis of ADPKD is made if there are $\\geq 3$ total renal cysts (unilateral or bilateral).\n    - The patient has $1$ cyst, which does not meet the diagnostic threshold of $\\geq 3$ cysts. Therefore, the screening result is considered \"negative\" for meeting the diagnostic rule.\n    - For exclusion of ADPKD, specific criteria based on the high negative predictive value (NPV) of having few or no cysts are used. For at-risk individuals aged $30-39$ years, a finding of fewer than $2$ cysts (i.e., $0$ or $1$ cyst) is the established criterion for excluding ADPKD.\n    - The patient is $35$ years old and has $1$ cyst. This finding meets the exclusion criterion. The decision rule is to declare the ultrasound a negative screen for ADPKD.\n\n2.  **Justify the Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**:\n    The NPV is the probability that a person with a negative test result truly does not have the disease. It is given by Bayes' theorem:\n    $$NPV = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)}$$\n    Where:\n    - $D$ is the event of having ADPKD, and $D^c$ is not having ADPKD.\n    - $T^-$ is a negative test result (in this case, $<2$ cysts).\n    - $P(D) = 0.5$ is the pretest probability.\n    - $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 0.5$.\n    - $P(T^- | D^c)$ is the specificity of the diagnostic rule ($\\geq 2$ cysts), i.e., the proportion of unaffected individuals who correctly test negative. Studies show this is very high, approaching $100\\%$. We can use a conservative estimate, say Specificity $\\approx 0.99$.\n    - $P(T^- | D)$ is the false-negative rate (FNR), which equals $1 - \\text{Sensitivity}$. The sensitivity of the criterion \"$\\geq 2$ cysts\" depends on the underlying mutation, as cyst growth is slower in Polycystic Kidney Disease $2$ (PKD2) than in Polycystic Kidney Disease $1$ (PKD1).\n        - For **PKD1** (approx. $85\\%$ of cases), the sensitivity for ages $30-39$ is approximately $99\\%$. Thus, $FNR_{PKD1} \\approx 1 - 0.99 = 0.01$.\n        - For **PKD2** (approx. $15\\%$ of cases), the sensitivity for ages $30-39$ is approximately $83\\%$. Thus, $FNR_{PKD2} \\approx 1 - 0.83 = 0.17$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the NPV**:\n    -   **For a patient with PKD1**:\n        $$NPV_{PKD1} = \\frac{(0.99)(0.5)}{(0.99)(0.5) + (0.01)(0.5)} = \\frac{0.495}{0.495 + 0.005} = \\frac{0.495}{0.500} = 0.99 \\text{ or } 99\\%$$\n        The post-test probability of disease is $1 - NPV_{PKD1} = 1\\%$.\n\n    -   **For a patient with PKD2**:\n        $$NPV_{PKD2} = \\frac{(0.99)(0.5)}{(0.99)(0.5) + (0.17)(0.5)} = \\frac{0.495}{0.495 + 0.085} = \\frac{0.495}{0.580} \\approx 0.853 \\text{ or } 85.3\\%$$\n\n    -   **Overall weighted NPV**:\n        The overall NPV is a weighted average of the NPVs for PKD1 and PKD2, based on their relative frequencies:\n        $$NPV_{overall} = (0.85 \\times NPV_{PKD1}) + (0.15 \\times NPV_{PKD2})$$\n        $$NPV_{overall} \\approx (0.85 \\times 0.99) + (0.15 \\times 0.853) \\approx 0.8415 + 0.128 \\approx 0.9695 \\text{ or } 97\\%$$\n\n    This calculation demonstrates that the NPV is very high, approximately $97\\%$. The post-test probability of disease is reduced from a pretest value of $50\\%$ to approximately $1 - 0.97 = 0.03$ or $3\\%$. This justifies excluding the diagnosis on the basis of the ultrasound findings.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Declare the ultrasound a negative screen for ADPKD because, in at-risk individuals aged $30$-$39$, a finding of $\\leq 1$ renal cyst is a validated exclusion criterion; the NPV is approximately $96\\%$ to $100\\%$ (near $100\\%$ for Polycystic Kidney Disease $1$ (PKD1)), reducing the post-test probability of ADPKD to at most a few percent.**\n- This option correctly identifies the exclusion criterion for this age group ($\\leq 1$ cyst is equivalent to $<2$ cysts).\n- It accurately states the high NPV, providing a range ($96\\%-100\\%$) that includes our calculated overall NPV of $97\\%$.\n- It correctly notes that the NPV for PKD1 is near $100\\%$ (our calculation was $99\\%$).\n- It correctly concludes that the post-test probability is reduced to a few percent (our calculation was $3\\%$).\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Do not exclude ADPKD because any renal cyst at age $35$ indicates disease; with a single cyst, the post-test probability remains $\\geq 50\\%$, so NPV is $\\leq 50\\%$.**\n- The assertion that \"any renal cyst at age $35$ indicates disease\" is factually incorrect. The validated diagnostic criteria require multiple cysts.\n- A negative test result from a useful test must, by definition, lower the probability of disease. Therefore, the post-test probability cannot remain $\\geq 50\\%$.\n- The conclusion that NPV is $\\leq 50\\%$ is statistically impossible for a valid test when the pre-test probability of not having the disease is $50\\%$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Do not exclude ADPKD because ultrasonography cannot support exclusion at age $35$; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is mandatory since incidental cysts are rare at this age, and NPV of an ultrasound study with a single cyst is $<70\\%$.**\n- The statement that \"ultrasonography cannot support exclusion at age $35$\" is false; the Pei criteria were specifically developed for this purpose using high-resolution ultrasound.\n- MRI is not mandatory for exclusion in this scenario.\n- The claim that the NPV is $<70\\%$ is a significant underestimate. Our calculation shows an overall NPV of $\\approx 97\\%$ and even for the less favorable PKD2 genotype, the NPV is $\\approx 85\\%$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Consider the result indeterminate because diagnosis in ages $15$-$39$ requires $\\geq 3$ cysts; with $1$ cyst, only genetic testing can exclude disease, and the NPV of a single-cyst ultrasound at this age is $<50\\%$.**\n- While the premise that diagnosis requires $\\geq 3$ cysts is correct, the conclusion that the result is indeterminate is not. Validated exclusion criteria exist.\n- The claim that \"only genetic testing can exclude disease\" is false. Imaging-based exclusion is standard practice.\n- The statement that the NPV is $<50\\%$ is egregiously false and statistically unsound, as explained for option B.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4321891"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis of ADPKD is established, the next critical step is to determine the patient's risk of rapid disease progression, which guides the intensity of monitoring and treatment.

The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe primary objective is to classify the patient's disease severity using the Mayo imaging classification for typical ADPKD. This requires two main steps: first, calculating the height-adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV), and second, comparing this value against age-specific thresholds to determine the risk subclass.\n\n1.  **Calculation of Height-Adjusted Total Kidney Volume (htTKV)**\n    The htTKV is a normalized metric that accounts for variations in kidney size due to patient stature. It is defined as the total kidney volume divided by the patient's height.\n\n    The given values are:\n    - Total Kidney Volume, TKV $= 950 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$\n    - Height, $h = 1.70 \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\n    The formula for htTKV is:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{htTKV} = \\frac{\\mathrm{TKV}}{h}\n    $$\n    Substituting the given values into the formula:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{htTKV} = \\frac{950 \\ \\mathrm{mL}}{1.70 \\ \\mathrm{m}} \\approx 558.8235... \\ \\mathrm{mL/m}\n    $$\n    The problem requires rounding the htTKV to four significant figures.\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{htTKV}_{\\text{rounded}} = 558.8 \\ \\mathrm{mL/m}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Determination of Mayo Imaging Classification Subclass**\n    The Mayo imaging classification stratifies patients with typical ADPKD into five risk classes ($1\\mathrm{A}$, $1\\mathrm{B}$, $1\\mathrm{C}$, $1\\mathrm{D}$, $1\\mathrm{E}$) based on their htTKV and age. These classes correspond to predicted annual rates of TKV growth. For a patient of a given age, there are specific htTKV thresholds that define the boundaries between these classes.\n\n    The patient's age is $35 \\ \\mathrm{years}$.
