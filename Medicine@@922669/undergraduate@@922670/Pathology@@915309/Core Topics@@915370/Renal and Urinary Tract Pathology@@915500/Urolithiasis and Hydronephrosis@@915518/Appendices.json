The solution will be derived by first establishing the relationship between supersaturation and urinary solute excretion, and then applying the specified treatment effect.\n\nThe calcium oxalate supersaturation index, denoted as $S$, is conceptually defined as the ratio of the ion activity product (IAP) of the constituent ions to the thermodynamic solubility product ($K_{sp}$). For calcium oxalate ($CaOx$), this is expressed as:\n$$\nS_{CaOx} = \\frac{\\text{IAP}_{CaOx}}{K_{sp, CaOx}}\n$$\nThe ion activity product is the product of the activities of the calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and oxalate ($Ox^{2-}$) ions in solution:\n$$\n\\text{IAP}_{CaOx} = a_{Ca^{2+}} \\cdot a_{Ox^{2-}}\n$$\nThe activity ($a_i$) of an ion $i$ is related to its molar concentration ($[i]$) by its activity coefficient ($\\gamma_i$), such that $a_i = \\gamma_i [i]$. Therefore, the supersaturation index can be written as:\n$$\nS_{CaOx} = \\frac{(\\gamma_{Ca^{2+}} [Ca^{2+}]) (\\gamma_{Ox^{2-}} [Ox^{2-}])}{K_{sp, CaOx}}\n$$\nThe problem provides several simplifying assumptions that allow for a direct calculation. Let us analyze these assumptions:\n1.  **Constant urine volume ($V = 2.0$ L/day)**: The concentration of a substance in urine is its daily excretion rate divided by the urine volume. For calcium, $[Ca^{2+}] = \\frac{U_{Ca}}{V}$, where $U_{Ca}$ is the daily calcium excretion.\n2.  **Constant urinary oxalate excretion ($U_{Ox}$)**: Since both $U_{Ox}$ and $V$ are constant, the concentration of oxalate, $[Ox^{2-}]$, is also constant.\n3.  **Constant ionic strength and temperature**: This implies that the activity coefficients ($\\gamma_{Ca^{2+}}$ and $\\gamma_{Ox^{2-}}$) and the solubility product ($K_{sp, CaOx}$, which is temperature-dependent) are constant.\n4.  **Constant urinary citrate**: Citrate is a major chelator of calcium, reducing the concentration of free, ionized calcium. Its constancy implies that the proportion of total calcium that is free and available to form crystals remains constant.\n\nBased on these assumptions, we can rearrange the supersaturation equation to isolate the variable term ($[Ca^{2+}]$) from the constant terms:\n$$\nS_{CaOx} = [Ca^{2+}] \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\gamma_{Ca^{2+}} \\gamma_{Ox^{2-}} [Ox^{2-}]}{K_{sp, CaOx}} \\right)\n$$\nSince every term within the parentheses is assumed to be constant, we can define a constant of proportionality, $k$, such that:\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\gamma_{Ca^{2+}} \\gamma_{Ox^{2-}} [Ox^{2-}]}{K_{sp, CaOx}}\n$$\nThis simplifies the relationship to:\n$$\nS_{CaOx} = k \\cdot [Ca^{2+}]\n$$\nThis shows that the supersaturation index is directly proportional to the urinary calcium concentration. Furthermore, because the urine volume $V$ is constant, the urinary calcium concentration $[Ca^{2+}]$ is directly proportional to the daily urinary calcium excretion $U_{Ca}$:\n$$\n[Ca^{2+}] = \\frac{U_{Ca}}{V} \\implies S_{CaOx} = k \\left( \\frac{U_{Ca}}{V} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{k}{V} \\right) U_{Ca}\n$$\nSince $k$ and $V$ are both constant, $S_{CaOx}$ is directly proportional to $U_{Ca}$. We can express this relationship as a ratio between the post-treatment (final, subscript $1$) and pre-treatment (baseline, subscript $0$) states:\n$$\n\\frac{S_1}{S_0} = \\frac{U_{Ca,1}}{U_{Ca,0}}\n$$\nThis ratio allows for the calculation of the final supersaturation $S_1$ if the initial and final calcium excretion rates are known.\n\nFirst, we calculate the expected post-treatment urinary calcium excretion, $U_{Ca,1}$.\nThe baseline excretion is given as $U_{Ca,0} = 300$ mg/day.\nThe treatment with chlorthalidone induces a mean relative reduction of $35\\%$, which is a factor of $0.35$.\nThe amount of reduction is $300 \\text{ mg/day} \\times 0.35 = 105$ mg/day.\nThe final excretion rate is the baseline rate minus the reduction:\n$$\nU_{Ca,1} = U_{Ca,0} - (U_{Ca,0} \\times 0.35) = U_{Ca,0} (1 - 0.35)\n$$\n$$\nU_{Ca,1} = 300 \\text{ mg/day} \\times (1 - 0.35) = 300 \\text{ mg/day} \\times 0.65 = 195 \\text{ mg/day}\n$$\nSo, the estimated post-treatment urinary calcium excretion is $195$ mg/day.\n\nNext, we use this result to predict the post-treatment supersaturation index, $S_1$.\nThe baseline supersaturation is given as $S_0 = 5.00$.\nUsing the proportionality derived earlier:\n$$\nS_1 = S_0 \\cdot \\frac{U_{Ca,1}}{U_{Ca,0}}\n$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$\nS_1 = 5.00 \\times \\frac{195 \\text{ mg/day}}{300 \\text{ mg/day}}\n$$\nThe ratio of excretion rates is $\\frac{195}{300} = 0.65$.\n$$\nS_1 = 5.00 \\times 0.65 = 3.25\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
