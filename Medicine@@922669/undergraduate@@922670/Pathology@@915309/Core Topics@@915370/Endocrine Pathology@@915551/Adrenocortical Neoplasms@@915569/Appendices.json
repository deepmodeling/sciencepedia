In CT, attenuation is measured in Hounsfield units (HU), where higher values reflect greater x-ray attenuation due to factors such as iodinated contrast concentration. A lipid-rich adrenocortical adenoma typically enhances after contrast administration and then loses attenuation over time as contrast washes out from the lesion’s vasculature and interstitium. Consider the following scientifically grounded principles:\n\n1. Contrast enhancement can be conceptualized as an additive increase in attenuation above a baseline, so the enhancement at a given time point is the difference between the measured attenuation at that time and the baseline noncontrast attenuation.\n2. A washout fraction is a dimensionless quantity that captures the fraction of enhancement that has dissipated (washed out) between two time points, defined as a ratio of a change to an appropriate reference quantity.\n\nLet the measured attenuations be $H_{\\mathrm{NC}}$ for the noncontrast phase (baseline), $H_{\\mathrm{PV}}$ for the portal venous phase (approximate peak enhancement), and $H_{\\mathrm{D}}$ for the delayed phase (e.g., acquired at $15$ minutes).

Do not use a percentage sign; if intermediate washout values are interpreted as percentages, express them as decimals or fractions.", "solution": "We begin from the foundational definitions provided.\n\n1. Enhancement above baseline at the portal venous phase is the increase in attenuation relative to the noncontrast baseline. Define\n$$\nE \\equiv H_{\\mathrm{PV}} - H_{\\mathrm{NC}}.\n$$\nThis represents how much attenuation was added by contrast at the portal venous time.\n\n2. The residual enhancement above baseline at the delayed phase is\n$$\nR \\equiv H_{\\mathrm{D}} - H_{\\mathrm{NC}}.\n$$\nThis is the portion of attenuation at the delayed time still above baseline.\n\n3. The absolute contrast washout is the fraction of the initial enhancement above baseline that has dissipated between the portal venous and delayed phases. The amount dissipated is $E - R$, and the appropriate reference for a fraction of dissipated enhancement is the initial enhancement $E$. Therefore,\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{abs}} \\equiv \\frac{E - R}{E} = \\frac{\\left(H_{\\mathrm{PV}} - H_{\\mathrm{NC}}\\right) - \\left(H_{\\mathrm{D}} - H_{\\mathrm{NC}}\\right)}{H_{\\mathrm{PV}} - H_{\\mathrm{NC}}} = \\frac{H_{\\mathrm{PV}} - H_{\\mathrm{D}}}{H_{\\mathrm{PV}} - H_{\\mathrm{NC}}}.\n$$\n\n4. The relative contrast washout is the fraction of the portal venous attenuation itself that has dissipated by the delayed phase, regardless of the baseline. The amount dissipated between portal venous and delayed phases is $H_{\\mathrm{PV}} - H_{\\mathrm{D}}$, and the reference quantity for a fraction relative to the portal venous attenuation is $H_{\\mathrm{PV}}$.

It is not incomplete, as the instruction to count only \"explicitly supported features\" provides a clear boundary for the analysis. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe Weiss system is a histopathological scoring model designed to predict the malignant potential of adrenocortical tumors. It consists of nine criteria. A tumor is classified as a carcinoma if it meets a certain threshold of these criteria, typically a score of $3$ or more. Each criterion that is present adds $1$ point to the total score. The nine criteria for malignancy are:\n\n$1$. High nuclear grade (equivalent to Fuhrman grades $3$ or $4$).\n$2$. Mitotic rate greater than $5$ per $50$ high-power fields (HPF).\n$3$. Presence of atypical mitoses.\n$4$. Low percentage of clear cells (specifically, clear cells composing $\\le 25\\%$ of the tumor, which implies that eosinophilic cells compose $\\ge 75\\%$ of the tumor).\n$5$. Diffuse architecture (affecting more than one-third, or $> 33.3\\%$, of the tumor surface).\n$6$. Presence of tumor necrosis (especially the confluent type).\n$7$. Venous (large vessel) invasion.\n$8$. Sinusoidal (small vessel) invasion.\n$9$. Capsular invasion.\n\nWe will now evaluate the provided histopathological features against these nine criteria.\n\n- **Feature 1: \"High nuclear grade (grade $3$ to $4$ nuclei).\"**\nThis directly corresponds to Weiss criterion $1$.\nTherefore, this criterion is **met**. Contribution to score = $1$.\n\n- **Feature 2: \"Mitotic rate of $8$ per $50$ high-power fields (HPF).\"**\nWeiss criterion $2$ is a mitotic rate $> 5$ per $50$ HPF. Since the observed rate is $8$, and $8 > 5$, this criterion is **met**. Contribution to score = $1$.\n\n- **Feature 3: \"Clear cell component comprising $20\\%$ of the tumor.\"**\nWeiss criterion $4$ for malignancy is met if clear cells constitute $\\le 25\\%$ of the tumor volume. The given value is $20\\%$. Since $20\\% \\le 25\\%$, this criterion is **met**. Contribution to score = $1$.\n\n- **Feature 4: \"Focal sinusoidal (small vessel) invasion.\"**\nThis directly corresponds to Weiss criterion $8$.\nTherefore, this criterion is **met**. Contribution to score = $1$.\n\n- **Feature 5: \"Confluent tumor necrosis present.\"**\nThis directly corresponds to Weiss criterion $6$. The term \"confluent\" further supports this finding.\nTherefore, this criterion is **met**. Contribution to score = $1$.\n\n- **Other Criteria:** The problem states that \"No other features are reported beyond those explicitly listed above.\" Based on this constraint, we must assume that any criteria not explicitly described are absent.\n    - Atypical mitoses (Criterion $3$): Not mentioned. Assumed **not met**. Contribution = $0$.\n    - Diffuse architecture (Criterion $5$): Not mentioned. Assumed **not met**. Contribution = $0$.\n    - Venous invasion (Criterion $7$): Not mentioned. Sinusoidal invasion is a separate criterion. Assumed **not met**. Contribution = $0$.\n    - Capsular invasion (Criterion $9$): Not mentioned. Assumed **not met**. Contribution = $0$.\n\n**Calculation of the Total Weiss Score**\nThe total Weiss score is the sum of the points from the met criteria:\nTotal Score $= (\\text{Nuclear Grade}) + (\\text{Mitotic Rate}) + (\\text{Clear Cells}) + (\\text{Sinusoidal Invasion}) + (\\text{Necrosis})$\nTotal Score $= 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5$.\n\n**Classification of the Tumor**\nThe standard threshold for classifying an adrenocortical tumor as malignant (an adrenocortical carcinoma) using the Weiss system is a score of $3$ or greater. Since the calculated score is $5$, and $5 \\ge 3$, the tumor is classified as an adrenocortical carcinoma.\n\nThe problem asks for the total Weiss score as the final integer answer.\nThe calculated total Weiss score is $5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "4321473"}, {"introduction": "Beyond their microscopic appearance, adrenocortical neoplasms are defined by their function. This problem moves from morphology to molecular physiology, challenging you to interpret a patient's clinical signs and complex steroid hormone profile [@problem_id:4321420]. By reasoning through the steroidogenesis pathway, you will learn to pinpoint specific enzymatic dysfunctions within a tumor, linking its genetic and metabolic state directly to the patient's symptoms.", "problem": "A patient aged 42 years is diagnosed with a malignant adrenocortical neoplasm based on imaging and histopathology, including strong nuclear positivity for Steroidogenic Factor 1 (SF-1) and high mitotic activity. The clinical phenotype includes new-onset hypertension and virilization. Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of serum steroids demonstrates a reproducible pattern of elevated $11$-deoxycortisol, elevated $11$-deoxycorticosterone, and elevated androgens (including dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione), with relatively low cortisol and low aldosterone.

It provides sufficient and consistent clinical and biochemical data to deduce the underlying enzymatic derangement in a malignant adrenocortical neoplasm. The core task is to interpret a specific pattern of serum steroids in the context of the adrenal steroidogenesis pathway.\n\nThe provided information is as follows:\n- **Patient**: 42-year-old with a malignant adrenocortical neoplasm.\n- **Histopathology**: Strong nuclear SF-1 positivity, high mitotic activity. This confirms the adrenocortical origin and malignancy of the tumor.\n- **Clinical Phenotype**: New-onset hypertension and virilization.\n- **Serum Steroid Profile (LC-MS/MS)**:\n    - Elevated $11$-deoxycortisol.\n    - Elevated $11$-deoxycorticosterone (DOC).\n    - Elevated androgens (e.g., dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione).\n    - Relatively low cortisol.\n    - Relatively low aldosterone.\n- **HPA Axis Status**: Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is not suppressed. This is consistent with the low cortisol, which fails to exert negative feedback on the pituitary, even though the tumor's steroid production is autonomous.\n\nThe analysis will proceed by tracing the canonical adrenal steroidogenesis pathway to identify the enzymatic step(s) whose dysfunction would produce the observed hormonal profile. The pathway can be divided into three main branches originating from cholesterol: mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Glucocorticoid Pathway**:\n    The pathway to cortisol is: Progesterone $\\xrightarrow{\\text{CYP17A1}}$ $17\\alpha$-hydroxyprogesterone $\\xrightarrow{\\text{CYP21A2}}$ $11$-deoxycortisol $\\xrightarrow{\\text{CYP11B1}}$ Cortisol.\n    The patient exhibits low cortisol and high $11$-deoxycortisol. This pattern is the definitive sign of a functional block at the final step of cortisol synthesis. The enzyme responsible for converting $11$-deoxycortisol to cortisol is $11\\beta$-hydroxylase (CYP$11$B$1$). A primary impairment of CYP$11$B$1$ activity would lead to the accumulation of its substrate ($11$-deoxycortisol) and a deficiency of its product (cortisol). This perfectly matches the provided data.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Mineralocorticoid Pathway**:\n    The pathway to aldosterone is: Progesterone $\\xrightarrow{\\text{CYP21A2}}$ $11$-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) $\\xrightarrow{\\text{CYP11B1}}$ Corticosterone $\\xrightarrow{\\text{CYP11B2}}$ Aldosterone.\n    The patient has low aldosterone and high $11$-deoxycorticosterone (DOC). The enzyme $11\\beta$-hydroxylase (CYP$11$B$1$) also catalyzes the conversion of DOC to corticosterone. Therefore, the same CYP$11$B$1$ impairment identified in the glucocorticoid pathway would also block the mineralocorticoid pathway, causing DOC to accumulate and preventing the synthesis of corticosterone and, subsequently, aldosterone. This is also a perfect match with the data.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Clinical Symptoms (Hypertension and Virilization)**:\n    - **Hypertension**: $11$-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) is a mineralocorticoid, albeit weaker than aldosterone. The significant elevation of DOC, resulting from the CYP$11$B$1$ block, leads to excessive mineralocorticoid receptor activation, causing sodium and water retention, which manifests as hypertension. This explains the patient's clinical sign.\n    - **Virilization**: An enzymatic block in the glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid pathways causes the massive flux of steroid precursors within the autonomous tumor to be shunted towards the only remaining open pathway: androgen synthesis. The pathway to androgens (DHEA, androstenedione) requires the activity of $17\\alpha$-hydroxylase/$17,20$-lyase (CYP$17$A$1$). The observed virilization and elevated serum androgens confirm that the androgen synthesis pathway is not only intact but is likely hyperactive due to this shunting effect. This requires preserved or upregulated CYP$17$A$1$ function.\n\n4.  **Role of Other Enzymes**:\n    - CYP$21$A$2$ ($21$-hydroxylase): This enzyme is required to produce both $11$-deoxycortisol (from $17\\alpha$-hydroxyprogesterone) and $11$-deoxycorticosterone (from progesterone). Since both of these precursors are elevated, the activity of CYP$21$A$2$ must be intact.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation**: The combined findings of elevated $11$-deoxycortisol and $11$-deoxycorticosterone, low cortisol and aldosterone, and clinical hypertension and virilization are most consistently and comprehensively explained by a primary impairment of $11\\beta$-hydroxylase (CYP$11$B$1$) activity within the malignant tumor, with intact CYP$21$A$2$ activity and a functional androgen synthesis pathway driven by CYP$17$A$1$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option based on this derivation.\n\n**A. Primary impairment of $11\\beta$-hydroxylase (CYP$11$B$1$) with intact $21$-hydroxylase (CYP$21$A$2$) and preserved or upregulated $17\\alpha$-hydroxylase/$17,20$-lyase (CYP$17$A$1$)**\nThis option aligns perfectly with our step-by-step derivation. Impaired CYP$11$B$1$ explains the accumulation of $11$-deoxycortisol and $11$-deoxycorticosterone, and the deficiency of cortisol and aldosterone. Intact CYP$21$A$2$ is required for the synthesis of the accumulated precursors. Preserved CYP$17$A$1$ is required for the shunting of precursors to the androgen pathway, causing virilization.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Primary impairment of $21$-hydroxylase (CYP$21$A$2$) with increased $11\\beta$-hydroxylase (CYP$11$B$1$) activity**\nIf CYP$21$A$2$ were impaired, the substrates $17\\alpha$-hydroxyprogesterone and progesterone would accumulate. The products $11$-deoxycortisol and $11$-deoxycorticosterone would be deficient. This is the opposite of the observed LC-MS/MS findings.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $17\\alpha$-hydroxylase/$17,20$-lyase (CYP$17$A$1$) deficiency with $11\\beta$-hydroxylase (CYP$11$B$1$) overactivity**\nA CYP$17$A$1$ deficiency would prevent the synthesis of both cortisol and androgens. This would eliminate virilization and prevent the formation of $11$-deoxycortisol. The steroid flux would be directed exclusively down the mineralocorticoid pathway. This contradicts the findings of virilization and elevated $11$-deoxycortisol.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $3\\beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type $2$ (HSD$3$B$2$) deficiency with $21$-hydroxylase (CYP$21$A$2$) overactivity**\nAn HSD$3$B$2$ deficiency impairs the synthesis of all major classes of active steroids (mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and potent androgens like androstenedione) from their pregnenolone-based precursors. It would cause an accumulation of DHEA, pregnenolone, and $17\\alpha$-hydroxypregnenolone. It would not lead to elevated $11$-deoxycortisol or $11$-deoxycorticosterone, which are downstream of HSD$3$B$2$. This is inconsistent with the data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Isolated aldosterone synthase (CYP$11$B$2$) deficiency with otherwise normal glucocorticoid pathway**\nAn isolated CYP$11$B$2$ deficiency would lead to low aldosterone but would not affect the glucocorticoid pathway. Thus, cortisol levels would be normal or high (due to tumor production), and $11$-deoxycortisol would not be elevated. This contradicts the findings of low cortisol and high $11$-deoxycortisol. Furthermore, it does not inherently explain the significant androgen excess.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4321420"}]}
