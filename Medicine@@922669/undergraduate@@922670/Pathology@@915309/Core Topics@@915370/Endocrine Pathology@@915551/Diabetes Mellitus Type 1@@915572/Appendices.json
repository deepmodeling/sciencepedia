A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the bicarbonate buffer system begins with the relevant chemical equilibria. In blood plasma, gaseous carbon dioxide $(CO_{2})$ dissolves and then hydrates to form carbonic acid $(H_{2}CO_{3})$, which in turn dissociates into a hydrogen ion $(H^{+})$ and a bicarbonate ion $(HCO_{3}^{-})$.\n\nThe hydration reaction is:\n$$CO_{2}(g) \\rightleftharpoons CO_{2}(aq)$$\n$$CO_{2}(aq) + H_{2}O(l) \\rightleftharpoons H_{2}CO_{3}(aq)$$\nThe dissociation of carbonic acid is:\n$$H_{2}CO_{3}(aq) \\rightleftharpoons H^{+}(aq) + HCO_{3}^{-}(aq)$$\nIn physiological systems, the concentration of carbonic acid, $[H_{2}CO_{3}]$, is very low compared to the concentration of dissolved $CO_{2}$. Therefore, it is common practice to combine these steps into a single apparent equilibrium:\n$$CO_{2}(aq) + H_{2}O(l) \\rightleftharpoons H^{+}(aq) + HCO_{3}^{-}(aq)$$\nThe apparent acid dissociation constant, $K_{a}$, for this overall process is given by the expression:\n$$K_{a} = \\frac{[H^{+}][HCO_{3}^{-}]}{[CO_{2}]_{aq}}$$\nwhere $[CO_{2}]_{aq}$ represents the concentration of all dissolved carbon dioxide (including the small amount of $H_{2}CO_{3}$).\n\nThe concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide, $[CO_{2}]_{aq}$, is related to its partial pressure in the gas phase, $P_{CO_{2}}$, by Henry's Law:\n$$[CO_{2}]_{aq} = \\alpha_{CO_{2}} \\times P_{CO_{2}}$$\nwhere $\\alpha_{CO_{2}}$ is the solubility coefficient of carbon dioxide in plasma.\n\nSubstituting the Henry's Law expression into the equation for $K_{a}$:\n$$K_{a} = \\frac{[H^{+}][HCO_{3}^{-}]}{\\alpha_{CO_{2}} \\times P_{CO_{2}}}$$\nTo derive an expression for pH, we first rearrange the equation to solve for the hydrogen ion concentration, $[H^{+}]$:\n$$[H^{+}] = K_{a} \\frac{\\alpha_{CO_{2}} \\times P_{CO_{2}}}{[HCO_{3}^{-}]}$$\nThe definition of pH is the negative base-$10$ logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration:\n$$\\text{pH} = -\\log_{10}([H^{+}])$$\nTaking the negative base-$10$ logarithm of both sides of the expression for $[H^{+}]$ gives:\n$$\\text{pH} = -\\log_{10}\\left(K_{a} \\frac{\\alpha_{CO_{2}} \\times P_{CO_{2}}}{[HCO_{3}^{-}]}\\right)$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\log(ab) = \\log(a) + \\log(b)$ and $\\log(a/b) = \\log(a) - \\log(b)$, we can expand this expression:\n$$\\text{pH} = -\\log_{10}(K_{a}) - \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{CO_{2}} \\times P_{CO_{2}}}{[HCO_{3}^{-}]}\\right)$$\nBy definition, $pK_{a} = -\\log_{10}(K_{a})$. Also, $-\\log(x/y) = \\log(y/x)$. Applying these identities, we arrive at the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the bicarbonate buffer system:\n$$\\text{pH} = pK_{a} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[HCO_{3}^{-}]}{\\alpha_{CO_{2}} \\times P_{CO_{2}}}\\right)$$\nThis is the required derived relation.\n\nNow, we apply this relation to compute the patient's blood pH using the provided data.\nThe given values are:\n- $pK_{a} = 6.1$\n- $\\alpha_{CO_{2}} = 0.030$ $\\mathrm{mmol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}^{-1}$\n- $[HCO_{3}^{-}] = 8$ $\\mathrm{mEq}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$, which is numerically equal to $8$ $\\mathrm{mmol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.\n- $P_{CO_{2}} = 20$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the denominator of the logarithmic term, which represents the concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide:\n$$[CO_{2}]_{aq} = \\alpha_{CO_{2}} \\times P_{CO_{2}} = (0.030 \\, \\mathrm{mmol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}^{-1}) \\times (20 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg})$$\n$$[CO_{2}]_{aq} = 0.60 \\, \\mathrm{mmol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\nNow, substitute the values of $pK_{a}$, $[HCO_{3}^{-}]$, and the calculated $[CO_{2}]_{aq}$ into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n$$\\text{pH} = 6.1 + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{8 \\, \\mathrm{mmol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}}{0.60 \\, \\mathrm{mmol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}}\\right)$$\n$$\\text{pH} = 6.1 + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{8}{0.6}\\right)$$\n$$\\text{pH} = 6.1 + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{80}{6}\\right)$$\n$$\\text{pH} = 6.1 + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{40}{3}\\right)$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{40}{3}\\right) \\approx \\log_{10}(13.333...)$$\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{40}{3}\\right) \\approx 1.1249387...$$\nAdding this to the $pK_{a}$:\n$$\\text{pH} \\approx 6.1 + 1.1249387...$$\n$$\\text{pH} \\approx 7.2249387...$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $7.2249387...$. Rounding to three significant figures yields $7.22$.

The serum anion gap is a powerful diagnostic calculation derived from the principle of electroneutrality in plasma.

It presents a classic clinical scenario of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and asks for a standard calculation and interpretation based on fundamental physiological principles.\n\nThe derivation and calculation will proceed as follows.\n\nThe foundational principle for understanding the serum anion gap is the law of electroneutrality, which states that in any macroscopic volume of plasma, the total concentration of positive charges (cations) must equal the total concentration of negative charges (anions).\n\nLet $C_{total}$ be the total concentration of cations and $A_{total}$ be the total concentration of anions in the serum, both expressed in milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). The principle of electroneutrality dictates:\n$$C_{total} = A_{total}$$\n\nThese totals can be broken down into measured and unmeasured components. The routinely measured cations in a basic metabolic panel are primarily sodium ($[\\text{Na}^+]$) and sometimes potassium ($[\\text{K}^+]$). The routinely measured anions are chloride ($[\\text{Cl}^-]$) and bicarbonate ($[\\text{HCO}_3^-]$).\n\nLet $C_{measured}$ be the sum of measured cations and $A_{measured}$ be the sum of measured anions.\nLet $U.C.$ (Unmeasured Cations) and $U.A.$ (Unmeasured Anions) represent the concentrations of all other cations (e.g., $[\\text{K}^+]$ if not included in the primary calculation, $[Ca^{2+}]$, $[Mg^{2+}]$) and anions (e.g., albumin, phosphate, sulfate, and organic anions like lactate or ketoacids), respectively.\n\nThe electroneutrality equation can be expanded as:\n$$C_{measured} + U.C. = A_{measured} + U.A.$$\n\nThe standard clinical definition for measured cations includes only sodium, and for measured anions, it includes chloride and bicarbonate:\n$$C_{measured} = [\\text{Na}^+]$$\n$$A_{measured} = [\\text{Cl}^-] + [\\text{HCO}_3^-]$$\n\nSubstituting these into the electroneutrality equation gives:\n$$[\\text{Na}^+] + U.C. = ([\\text{Cl}^-] + [\\text{HCO}_3^-]) + U.A.$$\n\nThe serum Anion Gap ($AG$) is defined as the difference between the concentration of unmeasured anions and unmeasured cations:\n$$AG \\equiv U.A. - U.C.$$\nThis value represents the net concentration of anions that are not routinely measured. A normal, healthy individual has a baseline anion gap primarily due to negatively charged proteins, with albumin being the most significant contributor.\n\nBy rearranging the electroneutrality equation to solve for $U.A. - U.C.$, we derive the standard expression for the anion gap:\n$$[\\text{Na}^+] - ([\\text{Cl}^-] + [\\text{HCO}_3^-]) = U.A. - U.C.$$\nTherefore, the standard expression for the serum anion gap is:\n$$AG = [\\text{Na}^+] - ([\\text{Cl}^-] + [\\text{HCO}_3^-])$$\n\nNow, we will compute the value of the anion gap for the given patient using the provided serum values:\n- $[\\text{Na}^+] = 137.5 \\text{ mEq/L}$\n- $[\\text{Cl}^-] = 101.3 \\text{ mEq/L}$\n- $[\\text{HCO}_3^-] = 8.72 \\text{ mEq/L}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$AG = 137.5 - (101.3 + 8.72)$$\n$$AG = 137.5 - 110.02$$\n$$AG = 27.48 \\text{ mEq/L}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$AG \\approx 27.5 \\text{ mEq/L}$$\n\nNext, we must interpret this result in the context of the patient's condition, which is highly suggestive of Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) as a complication of Type $1$ Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM).\nThe normal range for the serum anion gap is typically $3$ to $11$ mEq/L. The calculated value of $27.5$ mEq/L is markedly elevated, indicating a high anion gap metabolic acidosis.\n\nThis finding is entirely consistent with the accumulation of ketoacids. The pathophysiology of DKA in T1DM stems from an absolute deficiency of insulin. This deficiency has two major metabolic consequences:\n$1.$ Hyperglycemia: Glucose cannot be effectively utilized by peripheral tissues, and the liver engages in unopposed gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. This leads to the observed high serum glucose of $450$ mg/dL.\n$2.$ Ketogenesis: Lack of insulin promotes rampant lipolysis, releasing large quantities of free fatty acids from adipose tissue. These fatty acids are transported to the liver, where they undergo beta-oxidation to acetyl-CoA. In the low-insulin, high-glucagon state, acetyl-CoA is shunted away from the Krebs cycle and towards the synthesis of ketone bodies: acetoacetic acid ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{COCH}_2\\text{COOH}$) and $\\beta$-hydroxybutyric acid ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}(\\text{OH})\\text{CH}_2\\text{COOH}$).\n\nThese ketoacids are moderately strong acids and dissociate in the blood, releasing hydrogen ions ($H^+$) and their corresponding conjugate bases (keto-anions: acetoacetate and $\\beta$-hydroxybutyrate).\nThe increase in $[H^+]$ overwhelms the body's buffering capacity, primarily the bicarbonate buffer system ($H^+ + \\text{HCO}_3^- \\rightarrow \\text{H}_2\\text{CO}_3 \\rightarrow \\text{H}_2\\text{O} + \\text{CO}_2$). This consumption of bicarbonate leads to a decrease in serum $[\\text{HCO}_3^-]$ (as seen in the patient, $8.72$ mEq/L) and a drop in blood $pH$, causing metabolic acidosis ($pH=7.12$). The body attempts to compensate by expelling $CO_2$ through hyperventilation, resulting in the deep, labored breathing (Kussmaul respirations) observed.\n\nCritically, the keto-anions (acetoacetate and $\\beta$-hydroxybutyrate) are not measured in a standard metabolic panel. They therefore contribute to the \"Unmeasured Anions\" ($U.A.$) term. Their massive accumulation in DKA is precisely what causes the anion gap to widen significantly. The fruity odor on the patient's breath is due to the spontaneous decarboxylation of acetoacetic acid to acetone, which is volatile and exhaled.\n\nIn summary, the calculated high anion gap of $27.5$ mEq/L is a direct biochemical consequence of the accumulation of unmeasured keto-anions in the blood. This result confirms the diagnosis of a high anion gap metabolic acidosis and is perfectly consistent with the pathophysiology of Diabetic Ketoacidosis.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{27.5}\n$$", "id": "4353642"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the pathology of acute crises to the principles of daily management is key to understanding Type 1 Diabetes.
