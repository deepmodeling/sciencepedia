Established morphologic correlates of neuroendocrine differentiation and stromal amyloid.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated based on the established criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in the principles of surgical pathology, endocrinology, and molecular diagnostics. The description of the tumor's morphology (\"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin, trabecular growth), the stromal findings (eosinophilic material suggestive of amyloid), the clinical syndrome (diarrhea, family history), and the laboratory data (normal thyroglobulin, elevated peptide hormone) constitute a classic and realistic presentation of medullary thyroid carcinoma. The fundamental principles provided for reasoning are cornerstones of modern pathology. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The question asks to identify the set of findings that most strongly supports one diagnosis (MTC) over a specific differential diagnosis (metastatic NET). This is a standard and well-defined task in pathology, designed to have a single best answer among the options.\n- **Objective:** The problem uses standard, objective terminology from the field of pathology (e.g., \"trabecular,\" \"polygonal cells,\" \"finely granular chromatin\"). The clinical and laboratory data are presented as objective facts. There is no subjective or opinion-based language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-constructed, scientifically sound, and objective question typical of the field. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe central task is to differentiate a primary medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) from a neuroendocrine tumor (NET) that has metastasized to the thyroid gland. This distinction relies on identifying features specific to the thyroidal parafollicular C-cells (the cell of origin for MTC) versus features specific to NETs from other primary sites (e.g., lung, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract).\n\n1.  **Fundamental Principles Applied to MTC:**\n    - MTC arises from parafollicular C-cells of the thyroid. According to principles (i) and (iii), the defining functional characteristic of these cells is the synthesis of the hormone calcitonin. The gene for calcitonin (*CALCA*) is transcribed and translated into procalcitonin, which is then processed into calcitonin. Therefore, a definitive feature of MTC is the presence of calcitonin protein.\n    - Per principle (ii), immunohistochemistry (IHC) for calcitonin will detect this protein. Thus, a positive calcitonin stain is the sine qua non for diagnosing MTC.\n    - MTCs are neuroendocrine tumors and will therefore express general neuroendocrine markers, such as chromogranin and synaptophysin.\n    - MTCs characteristically co-express carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).\n    - Per principle (iv), the \"amorphous eosinophilic material\" described is highly suggestive of amyloid. In MTC, this amyloid is composed of deposited procalcitonin fibrils. Its presence can be confirmed with a Congo red stain, which classically shows apple-green birefringence under polarized light. This finding is characteristic of, but not exclusive to, MTC.\n    - C-cells do not produce thyroglobulin. An MTC, being a C-cell tumor, will therefore be negative for thyroglobulin, distinguishing it from follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinomas. The patient's normal serum thyroglobulin level is consistent with this.\n    - A family history of endocrine tumors, as given, raises suspicion for Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type $2$ (MEN$2$), a genetic syndrome caused by germline mutations in the *RET* proto-oncogene, which is strongly associated with MTC. In hereditary MTC, the surrounding thyroid gland often shows C-cell hyperplasia (CCH), a precursor lesion.\n\n2.  **Fundamental Principles Applied to Metastatic NET:**\n    - A metastatic NET to the thyroid will recapitulate the features of its primary site.\n    - Per principles (i), (ii), and (iii), it will express proteins and transcription factors characteristic of its tissue of origin, but it will **not** produce calcitonin (a C-cell specific product).\n    - Examples of lineage-specific markers include:\n        - **Lung NET:** Often positive for Thyroid Transcription Factor-$1$ (TTF-$1$).\n        - **Midgut NET:** Often positive for Caudal type homeobox $2$ (CDX$2$) and serotonin.\n        - **Pancreatic NET:** May express various pancreatic hormones (e.g., insulin, glucagon) and transcription factors like ISL$1$.\n    - All NETs will generally express chromogranin and/or synaptophysin. They will be negative for thyroglobulin.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. IHC: calcitonin ($+$), carcinoembryonic antigen ($+$), chromogranin ($+$), synaptophysin ($+$), thyroglobulin ($-$); morphology: Congo red–positive stromal deposits with apple-green birefringence; clinical: background C-cell hyperplasia in adjacent thyroid and a family history suggestive of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) type $2$.**\n- **Analysis:** This option presents a comprehensive and quintessential collection of findings for MTC.\n    - The IHC profile is classic: calcitonin ($+$) confirms C-cell origin; chromogranin ($+$)/synaptophysin ($+$) confirm neuroendocrine differentiation; CEA ($+$) is characteristic; thyroglobulin ($-$) rules out a follicular-derived primary.\n    - The morphology confirms the stromal material is amyloid, a hallmark of MTC.\n    - The clinical findings of C-cell hyperplasia and a family history suggestive of MEN$2$ provide powerful, independent confirmation of a primary, likely hereditary, MTC.\n- **Verdict:** This option provides the strongest and most complete evidence for a diagnosis of primary MTC, perfectly aligning with the initial problem description. **Correct**.\n\n**B. IHC: chromogranin ($+$), synaptophysin ($+$), thyroid transcription factor-$1$ (TTF-$1$) ($+$), calcitonin ($-$); morphology: organoid nests without stromal amyloid; clinical: prior resection of a pulmonary carcinoid tumor $4$ years ago.**\n- **Analysis:** This option describes a NET that is TTF-$1$ positive but, crucially, **calcitonin negative**. While MTCs can be TTF-$1$ positive, calcitonin negativity effectively rules out MTC. The TTF-$1$ positivity, combined with the documented history of a pulmonary carcinoid tumor, provides overwhelming evidence for a metastasis from the lung.\n- **Verdict:** This option strongly supports a diagnosis of metastatic NET, not primary MTC. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. IHC: thyroglobulin ($+$), paired box protein $8$ (PAX$8$) ($+$), TTF-$1$ ($+$); morphology: colloid-containing follicles and papillary nuclear features; clinical: no known extra-thyroid malignancy.**\n- **Analysis:** The positive staining for thyroglobulin indicates an origin from thyroid follicular cells. The morphology described (papillary nuclear features) is diagnostic of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (PTC). This picture is inconsistent with the neuroendocrine appearance, \"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin, and normal serum thyroglobulin described in the problem stem.\n- **Verdict:** This option describes a different type of primary thyroid cancer (PTC), not an MTC or a metastatic NET. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. IHC: synaptophysin ($+$), chromogranin ($+$), caudal type homeobox $2$ (CDX$2$) ($+$), serotonin ($+$), calcitonin ($-$); morphology: nested/trabecular architecture without amyloid; clinical: prior midgut neuroendocrine tumor resected $3$ years ago.**\n- **Analysis:** This option describes a NET that is positive for CDX$2$ and serotonin, markers highly characteristic of a midgut primary site. The tumor is **calcitonin negative**, which rules out MTC. The clinical history of a resected midgut NET provides a clear primary source for the metastasis.\n- **Verdict:** This option strongly supports a diagnosis of metastatic NET from the midgut, not primary MTC. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. IHC: calcitonin ($+$), carcinoembryonic antigen ($-$), CDX$2$ ($+$); morphology: no stromal amyloid; clinical: chronic watery diarrhea and known pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor under surveillance.**\n- **Analysis:** This option presents a conflicting and atypical immunoprofile. Calcitonin positivity points towards MTC, but CDX$2$ positivity is characteristic of a gastrointestinal NET. CEA negativity is atypical for MTC. The presence of a known pancreatic NET would favor a metastasis, but pancreatic NETs are not expected to be positive for either calcitonin or CDX$2$. This combination of findings is biologically confusing and does not provide strong, clear-cut evidence for MTC. Compared to the textbook-perfect case in option A, this option is significantly weaker.\n- **Verdict:** The findings are contradictory and do not strongly or clearly support a diagnosis of MTC over a metastatic process. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4402945"}, {"introduction": "Beyond diagnosis, pathology plays a key role in prognosis and monitoring disease.

It is based on numerical data and established mathematical modeling techniques, with no subjective or ambiguous elements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires estimating the calcitonin doubling time from a series of measurements, assuming exponential growth kinetics.\n\n**1. Justification of the Exponential Model**\nThe problem states that the biomarker kinetics are driven by a constant fractional growth rate. This implies that the rate of change of the calcitonin concentration, $\\frac{dC}{dt}$, is directly proportional to the current concentration, $C(t)$. We can express this as a differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = kC\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the constant fractional growth rate. This is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{C} dC = k \\, dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from an initial time $t=0$ with concentration $C_0$ to a time $t$ with concentration $C(t)$:\n$$\n\\int_{C_0}^{C(t)} \\frac{1}{C'} dC' = \\int_{0}^{t} k \\, dt'\n$$\n$$\n[\\ln(C')]_{C_0}^{C(t)} = [kt']_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C_0) = kt\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C_0}\\right) = kt\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the exponential growth model:\n$$\nC(t) = C_0 \\exp(kt)\n$$\n\n**2. Linearization and Least-Squares Estimation**\nTo estimate the growth rate $k$ from the data, we linearize the exponential model. By taking the natural logarithm of the equation $C(t) = C_0 \\exp(kt)$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\ln(C(t)) = \\ln(C_0) + kt\n$$\nThis equation is in the form of a straight line, $y = b + mx$, where $y = \\ln(C)$, $x = t$, the slope is $m = k$, and the y-intercept is $b = \\ln(C_0)$. We can now use linear regression (the method of least squares) on the transformed data points $(t_i, \\ln(C_i))$ to find the best-fit slope, which corresponds to our estimate for $k$.\n\nThe data pairs $(t_i, C_i)$ are transformed to $(t_i, y_i)$ where $y_i = \\ln(C_i)$:\n- $(0, \\ln(50)) \\approx (0, 3.9120)$\n- $(3, \\ln(62)) \\approx (3, 4.1271)$\n- $(6, \\ln(76)) \\approx (6, 4.3307)$\n- $(9, \\ln(94)) \\approx (9, 4.5433)$\n- $(12, \\ln(116)) \\approx (12, 4.7536)$\n- $(15, \\ln(143)) \\approx (15, 4.9628)$\n\nFor a set of $N$ data points $(x_i, y_i)$, the slope $m$ of the least-squares regression line is given by:\n$$\nm = k = \\frac{N \\sum(x_i y_i) - (\\sum x_i)(\\sum y_i)}{N \\sum(x_i^2) - (\\sum x_i)^2}\n$$\nHere, $x_i = t_i$ and $y_i = \\ln(C_i)$. We have $N=6$ data points. Let's compute the required sums:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{6} t_i = 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 15 = 45\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{6} t_i^2 = 0^2 + 3^2 + 6^2 + 9^2 + 12^2 + 15^2 = 0 + 9 + 36 + 81 + 144 + 225 = 495\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{6} y_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\ln(C_i) = \\ln(50) + \\ln(62) + \\ln(76) + \\ln(94) + \\ln(116) + \\ln(143) \\approx 26.62962\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{6} t_i y_i = 0\\ln(50) + 3\\ln(62) + 6\\ln(76) + 9\\ln(94) + 12\\ln(116) + 15\\ln(143) \\approx 210.74120\n$$\nNow, substitute these sums into the formula for the slope $k$:\n$$\nk = \\frac{6(210.74120) - (45)(26.62962)}{6(495) - (45)^2} = \\frac{1264.4472 - 1198.3329}{2970 - 2025} = \\frac{66.1143}{945}\n$$\n$$\nk \\approx 0.0699622 \\text{ months}^{-1}\n$$\n\n**3.

This exercise will guide you through the critical preoperative pathway required to screen for a co-existing pheochromocytoma, reinforcing the principle that a pathologist's diagnosis has profound and immediate implications for safe and effective clinical management.", "problem": "A patient with a clinical picture suggestive of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type $2$ (MEN$2$) presents for evaluation prior to thyroid surgery. A 28-year-old person has a firm thyroid nodule and persistent diarrhea. Family history reveals early thyroid cancer in a parent and a known rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene mutation in a sibling. Laboratory evaluation shows markedly elevated serum calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and thyroid ultrasound demonstrates a hypoechoic nodule in the upper pole of the right lobe measuring $2.3$ $\\mathrm{cm}$ with suspicious cervical lymph nodes. Blood pressure is intermittently elevated to $180/100$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$ with episodes of palpitations and headache. The surgical team plans definitive thyroidectomy but asks for a preoperative workup pathway that mandates exclusion of pheochromocytoma and a justification for an alpha-blockade protocol.\n\nUsing foundational facts about endocrine neoplasia and receptor pharmacology, select the most appropriate pathway that prioritizes patient safety and adheres to the requirement of excluding pheochromocytoma prior to thyroid surgery, and justify the use and sequence of adrenergic blockade protocols.\n\nWhich option best describes the correct pathway and rationale?\n\nA. Before any thyroid surgery, perform biochemical screening for pheochromocytoma with either plasma free fractionated metanephrines or $24$-hour urinary fractionated metanephrines; if positive, localize with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the adrenal glands and consider metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy if imaging is equivocal. Proceed to adrenalectomy first, only after $7$ to $14$ days of preoperative alpha blockade (for example, phenoxybenzamine or doxazosin) titrated to achieve controlled blood pressure without severe orthostasis, along with liberal salt and fluid intake to expand intravascular volume. Add a beta-blocker (for example, propranolol or metoprolol) only after adequate alpha blockade if tachycardia persists. Schedule thyroidectomy for medullary thyroid carcinoma after the pheochromocytoma has been definitively treated.\n\nB. Because medullary thyroid carcinoma is malignant, prioritize immediate thyroidectomy. Screen for pheochromocytoma postoperatively. If adrenergic symptoms occur preoperatively, start a beta-blocker first to control heart rate, and add alpha blockade later if needed. Manage any adrenal lesions on follow-up imaging at a later date.\n\nC. Rely primarily on imaging to exclude pheochromocytoma by obtaining an adrenal ultrasound; if no mass is seen, proceed directly to thyroidectomy. Use a calcium channel blocker for blood pressure control preoperatively. If an adrenal mass is later discovered, plan adrenalectomy after thyroid surgery and avoid alpha blockade unless intraoperative hypertension occurs.\n\nD. Measure serum catecholamines only, and if normal, consider pheochromocytoma excluded. If levels are elevated, perform simultaneous thyroidectomy and adrenalectomy under a single anesthesia session to limit operative episodes, using a rapid intravenous alpha blocker (for example, phentolamine) immediately preoperatively, and begin a beta-blocker first to prevent tachyarrhythmias. Avoid prolonged preoperative preparation to reduce hospital length of stay.\n\nE. Use genetic testing for RET proto-oncogene mutations as the sole screening tool for pheochromocytoma. If RET is positive, proceed with thyroidectomy, and treat hypertensive episodes with labetalol alone preoperatively. Reserve adrenal imaging for patients with refractory hypertension, as catecholamine levels are often variable and unnecessary to measure if genetic risk is established.", "solution": "The user wants me to act as a meticulous STEM professor and solve a clinical problem related to Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2 (MEN2).\n\nHere's my plan:\n1.  **Validate the Problem Statement:**\n    *   **Step 1: Extract Givens.** I will list all the clinical information provided about the patient and the surgical team's request.\n    *   **Step 2: Validate.** I will check if the problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n        *   **Scientific Grounding:** The case describes a classic presentation of MEN2, specifically MEN2A or MEN2B. Key features: medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), potential pheochromocytoma, and a known family history with a RET mutation. The clinical signs (firm thyroid nodule, diarrhea, elevated calcitonin/CEA), symptoms suggestive of pheochromocytoma (intermittent severe hypertension, palpitations, headache), and the family history all point towards MEN2. This is a well-established clinical syndrome. The core concepts of MTC, pheochromocytoma, and the role of the RET proto-oncogene are fundamental to endocrinology and surgical pathology.

It is characterized by a high risk of developing Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC), Pheochromocytoma, and (in MEN2A) Primary Hyperparathyroidism.\n        *   **The \"Rule of 10s\" is outdated, but the core principle is key:** Pheochromocytomas are tumors of the adrenal medulla that secrete catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine).\n        *   **The Critical Danger:** The most life-threatening component of MEN2 in the short term, especially during surgery, is an undiagnosed pheochromocytoma. Anesthesia induction, intubation, or surgical manipulation can trigger a massive release of catecholamines from the tumor, leading to a hypertensive crisis, stroke, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and death.\n        *   **The Cardinal Rule:** Therefore, in any patient with suspected or confirmed MEN2 (or even just an MTC diagnosis, as about 25% are hereditary), pheochromocytoma **must** be ruled out *before* any surgical procedure, especially one as stimulating as a thyroidectomy. The pheochromocytoma, if present, must be surgically removed *first*.\n        *   **Biochemical Diagnosis:** The most sensitive and specific screening tests for pheochromocytoma are plasma free fractionated metanephrines or 24-hour urinary fractionated metanephrines. Catecholamines themselves have a short half-life and are released episodically, making them a less sensitive test. Metanephrines are metabolites of catecholamines and are produced more continuously within the tumor, making them a better screening tool.\n        *   **Localization:** Once biochemical diagnosis is confirmed, imaging is used for localization. CT or MRI of the abdomen/adrenals are the primary modalities. MIBG scintigraphy can be useful if imaging is equivocal or if extra-adrenal disease is suspected.\n        *   **Pharmacological Preparation for Adrenalectomy:** To prevent perioperative hypertensive crisis, patients with pheochromocytoma require careful preoperative medical management.\n            *   **Alpha-adrenergic blockade:** This is the cornerstone. It must be initiated first. It blocks the effects of catecholamines on alpha-receptors, primarily controlling vasoconstriction and thus hypertension. Phenoxybenzamine (non-selective, irreversible) or selective alpha-1 blockers like doxazosin are used. This is typically done for 7-14 days to allow blood pressure to normalize and, critically, for the intravascular volume to expand (as chronic vasoconstriction leads to volume contraction). A high-salt diet and fluid intake are encouraged to facilitate this volume expansion.\n            *   **Beta-adrenergic blockade:** This is added **only after** adequate alpha blockade has been established. Beta-blockers (like propranolol or metoprolol) are used to control reflex tachycardia that can result from alpha blockade and vasodilation, or to control direct catecholamine effects on the heart. **Crucially, if beta-blockade is given first, it will block beta-2-mediated vasodilation, leaving alpha-1-mediated vasoconstriction unopposed, which can lead to a paradoxical and severe hypertensive crisis.** This is a fundamental pharmacological principle.\n        *   **Surgical Sequence:** If a pheochromocytoma is found, adrenalectomy is performed first. After the patient has recovered, the thyroidectomy for MTC can be scheduled.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **Option A:**\n        *   Biochemical screening (plasma/urinary metanephrines) before thyroid surgery. **Correct.** This is the standard of care.\n        *   Localization with CT/MRI, MIBG if needed. **Correct.** This is the standard imaging pathway.\n        *   Adrenalectomy *first*. **Correct.** This is a critical safety principle.\n        *   Preoperative alpha blockade for 7-14 days. **Correct.** This is the required preparation.\n        *   Liberal salt/fluid intake. **Correct.** This is to expand volume.\n        *   Beta-blocker *after* alpha blockade if tachycardia persists. **Correct.** This is the correct sequence and rationale.\n        *   Thyroidectomy scheduled *after* pheochromocytoma is treated. **Correct.**\n        *   Overall, this option perfectly describes the standard, safe, and evidence-based management pathway.\n\n    *   **Option B:**\n        *   Prioritize immediate thyroidectomy. **Incorrect and dangerous.** This violates the cardinal rule of excluding pheochromocytoma first.\n        *   Screen for pheochromocytoma postoperatively. **Incorrect.** This puts the patient at extreme risk during the thyroidectomy.\n        *   Start a beta-blocker first. **Incorrect and extremely dangerous.** This can precipitate a hypertensive crisis due to unopposed alpha-receptor stimulation.\n\n    *   **Option C:**\n        *   Rely on imaging (adrenal ultrasound) to exclude pheochromocytoma. **Incorrect.** Biochemical testing is far more sensitive. A pheochromocytoma can be small or functional without being visible on ultrasound. Biochemical screening must be done first.\n        *   If no mass is seen, proceed to thyroidectomy. **Incorrect.** This is unsafe.\n        *   Use calcium channel blocker for BP control. While CCBs can be used as adjuncts, they are not the primary and sufficient therapy for preparing a pheochromocytoma for surgery. Alpha blockade is mandatory.\n        *   Avoid alpha blockade unless intraoperative hypertension occurs. **Incorrect.** This is reactive, not proactive, and extremely risky. The goal is prevention.\n\n    *   **Option D:**\n        *   Measure serum catecholamines only. **Incorrect.** Metanephrines are the superior screening test due to their longer half-life and more continuous production.\n        *   Perform simultaneous thyroidectomy and adrenalectomy. **Incorrect.** While this is sometimes considered in highly specialized centers for select cases, it is not the standard, safest approach. The standard is to stage the procedures, adrenalectomy first. A combined procedure increases complexity and risk.\n        *   Use a rapid IV alpha blocker immediately preoperatively. **Incorrect.** This does not allow for the necessary volume expansion that a 7-14 day oral blockade regimen provides. It's a crisis management tool, not an adequate preparation strategy.\n        *   Begin a beta-blocker first. **Incorrect and dangerous.** Same reason as in Option B.\n\n    *   **Option E:**\n        *   Use genetic testing (RET mutation) as the sole screening tool. **Incorrect.** A positive RET mutation confirms the *risk* for pheochromocytoma, but it does not confirm its *presence*. Biochemical testing is required to see if a tumor is actually present and secreting catecholamines.\n        *   Proceed with thyroidectomy. **Incorrect.** This skips the necessary biochemical screening.\n        *   Treat with labetalol alone. **Incorrect.** Labetalol is a mixed alpha- and beta-blocker. However, its beta-blocking activity is significantly stronger than its alpha-blocking activity (ratio is about 1:7 for IV, 1:3 for oral). For pheochromocytoma, this ratio is generally considered inadequate to provide safe and complete alpha blockade before the beta blockade takes effect. It can be dangerous and is not the first-line, gold-standard approach, which is a pure alpha-blocker first. Phenoxybenzamine or doxazosin are preferred.\n        *   Reserve adrenal imaging for refractory hypertension. **Incorrect.** If biochemical tests are positive, imaging is mandatory for localization, not just for \"refractory\" cases.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Option A aligns perfectly with the established, principle-based, and patient-safety-focused standard of care for managing a patient with suspected MEN2 and a potential pheochromocytoma.\n    *   All other options contain one or more critical, life-threatening errors in their proposed management pathway.\n\n5.  **Final Polish:**\n    *   I will write out the solution, ensuring every mathematical and scientific term is in LaTeX.\n    *   I will explicitly state the verdict (Correct/Incorrect) for each option and provide the justification based on my derived principles.\n    *   I will format the final answer in the `$$\\boxed{...}$$` tag as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{A}\n$$", "id": "4402973"}]}
