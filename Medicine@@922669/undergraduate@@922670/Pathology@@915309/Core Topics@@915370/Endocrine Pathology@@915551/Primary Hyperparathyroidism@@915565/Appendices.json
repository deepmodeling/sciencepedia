You are evaluating for primary hyperparathyroidism in the setting of possible hypoalbuminemia.

Only the numerical value should be recorded as your final answer.", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid after a thorough review. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of physiology and endocrinology, well-posed with all necessary data provided for the calculation, and objectively stated.\n\nThe central physiological principle is that parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion is tightly regulated by the concentration of physiologically active ionized calcium ($[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$) in the blood. A significant fraction of total serum calcium, approximately $40$-$45\\%$, is bound to proteins, primarily albumin. Therefore, the measured total serum calcium concentration ($[\\mathrm{Ca}]_{\\mathrm{total}}$) is a composite of ionized calcium, complexed calcium (e.g., with phosphate or citrate), and protein-bound calcium.\n\n$$[\\mathrm{Ca}]_{\\mathrm{total}} = [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{ionized}} + [\\mathrm{Ca}]_{\\mathrm{complexed}} + [\\mathrm{Ca}]_{\\mathrm{protein-bound}}$$\n\nWhen serum albumin concentration ($[\\mathrm{Alb}]$) is abnormally low (hypoalbuminemia), the protein-bound fraction of calcium decreases, leading to a lower total serum calcium measurement. This can mask a true hypercalcemia (elevated ionized calcium) or create the appearance of hypocalcemia when the ionized calcium is actually normal. To account for this, the total calcium measurement must be \"corrected\" for the albumin level to provide a better estimate of what the total calcium would be if the albumin were normal (typically assumed to be $4.0$ g/dL).\n\nThe problem provides a standard clinical formula for this correction:\n$$[\\mathrm{Ca}]_{\\mathrm{corr}} = [\\mathrm{Ca}]_{\\mathrm{meas}} + 0.8 \\times (4.0 - [\\mathrm{Alb}])$$\nwhere $[\\mathrm{Ca}]_{\\mathrm{corr}}$ is the albumin-corrected calcium in mg/dL, $[\\mathrm{Ca}]_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ is the measured total calcium in mg/dL, and $[\\mathrm{Alb}]$ is the serum albumin in g/dL. The factor of $0.8$ represents the approximate amount in mg/dL that total calcium decreases for every $1.0$ g/dL decrease in serum albumin.\n\nThe given laboratory values are:\n- Measured total serum calcium, $[\\mathrm{Ca}]_{\\mathrm{meas}} = 10.6$ mg/dL\n- Serum albumin, $[\\mathrm{Alb}] = 2.7$ g/dL\n\nWe substitute these values into the correction formula:\n$$[\\mathrm{Ca}]_{\\mathrm{corr}} = 10.6 + 0.8 \\times (4.0 - 2.7)$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the difference in albumin concentration from the normal reference value:\n$$4.0 - 2.7 = 1.3$$\n\nNext, we calculate the correction factor:\n$$0.8 \\times 1.3 = 1.04$$\n\nFinally, we add this correction factor to the measured calcium concentration:\n$$[\\mathrm{Ca}]_{\\mathrm{corr}} = 10.6 + 1.04 = 11.64$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value of $11.64$ already contains four significant figures. Thus, the albumin-corrected calcium concentration is $11.64$ mg/dL.\n\nTo address the qualitative part of the question: a corrected calcium of $11.64$ mg/dL is unequivocally elevated (hypercalcemia), as the upper limit of the normal reference range is typically around $10.2$ to $10.5$ mg/dL. Primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by the autonomous overproduction of PTH by one or more parathyroid glands, which is no longer appropriately suppressed by high serum calcium. In a normal physiological state, hypercalcemia would cause negative feedback on the parathyroid glands, leading to a very low or undetectable PTH level.\n\nIn this patient, we have the combination of:\n1.  Significant hypercalcemia, as established by the corrected calcium value of $11.64$ mg/dL.\n2.  An inappropriately high PTH level of $110$ pg/mL (typical upper limit of normal is $\\approx 65$ pg/mL).\n\nThe simultaneous presence of hypercalcemia and a non-suppressed (in this case, elevated) PTH level is the biochemical hallmark of primary hyperparathyroidism. The other laboratory findings are also consistent with this diagnosis: low serum phosphate ($2.2$ mg/dL, due to the phosphaturic effect of PTH on the kidneys), and high $24$-hour urine calcium ($280$ mg/day, consistent with hypercalciuria caused by an increased filtered load of calcium overwhelming PTH-mediated renal tubular reabsorption). The vitamin D level is sufficient, ruling out secondary hyperparathyroidism due to vitamin D deficiency.
