It provides all necessary information for a complete solution.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $M$: The event that a nodule is malignant.\n- $H$: The event that a nodule is healthy (benign).\n- $T^+$: The event that the Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA) test result is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the FNA test result is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n- The prevalence of malignancy: $P(M) = 0.25$.\n- The sensitivity of the FNA test: $P(T^+ | M) = 0.92$.\n- The specificity of the FNA test: $P(T^- | H) = 0.88$.\n\nFrom these given values, we can derive several complementary probabilities. Since a nodule is either malignant or healthy, the probability of a nodule being healthy is:\n$$ P(H) = 1 - P(M) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 $$\nThe sensitivity is the true positive rate. The complement, the false negative rate (the probability of a negative test given malignancy), is:\n$$ P(T^- | M) = 1 - P(T^+ | M) = 1 - 0.92 = 0.08 $$\nThe specificity is the true negative rate. The complement, the false positive rate (the probability of a positive test given no malignancy), is:\n$$ P(T^+ | H) = 1 - P(T^- | H) = 1 - 0.88 = 0.12 $$\n\nThe task is to derive and compute the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and the Negative Predictive Value (NPV).\n\n**Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\nThe PPV is the probability that a patient has the disease given a positive test result, which is denoted as $P(M | T^+)$. We use Bayes' theorem to find this value:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(M | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | M) P(M)}{P(T^+)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. It can be found using the law of total probability, summing the probabilities of a true positive and a false positive:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ | M) P(M) + P(T^+ | H) P(H) $$\nSubstituting this into the Bayes' theorem expression for PPV, we get the general formula in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{P(T^+ | M) P(M)}{P(T^+ | M) P(M) + (1 - P(T^- | H)) P(H)} = \\frac{(\\text{sensitivity}) \\times (\\text{prevalence})}{(\\text{sensitivity}) \\times (\\text{prevalence}) + (1 - \\text{specificity}) \\times (1 - \\text{prevalence})} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{(0.92) \\times (0.25)}{(0.92) \\times (0.25) + (0.12) \\times (0.75)} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.23}{0.23 + 0.09} = \\frac{0.23}{0.32} = 0.71875 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the PPV is $0.7188$.\n\n**Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\nThe NPV is the probability that a patient does not have the disease given a negative test result, which is denoted as $P(H | T^-)$. Again, we use Bayes' theorem:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = P(H | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | H) P(H)}{P(T^-)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of obtaining a negative test result, found by summing the probabilities of a true negative and a false negative:\n$$ P(T^-) = P(T^- | H) P(H) + P(T^- | M) P(M) $$\nSubstituting this into the Bayes' theorem expression for NPV, we get the general formula:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{P(T^- | H) P(H)}{P(T^- | H) P(H) + (1 - P(T^+ | M)) P(M)} = \\frac{(\\text{specificity}) \\times (1 - \\text{prevalence})}{(\\text{specificity}) \\times (1 - \\text{prevalence}) + (1 - \\text{sensitivity}) \\times (\\text{prevalence})} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{(0.88) \\times (0.75)}{(0.88) \\times (0.75) + (0.08) \\times (0.25)} $$\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{0.66}{0.66 + 0.02} = \\frac{0.66}{0.68} \\approx 0.9705882... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the NPV is $0.9706$.\n\n**Implications for Clinical Follow-up Pathways**\nThe calculated values have direct and distinct implications for managing patients post-FNA.\n- A **Positive Result (PPV $\\approx 0.72$)**: A PPV of $0.7188$ indicates that if a patient's FNA is positive, there is a $71.88\\%$ probability that the nodule is malignant. Critically, this also means there is a $1 - 0.7188 = 0.2812$, or $28.12\\%$, chance that the result is a false positive and the nodule is benign. This false positive rate is too high to justify proceeding directly to aggressive treatments like surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. Therefore, a positive FNA result serves as a strong indication for, but not a confirmation of, malignancy. The standard clinical pathway is to escalate to a more definitive, albeit more invasive, diagnostic procedure, such as a core needle biopsy or a surgical excisional biopsy, to obtain histopathological confirmation before initiating cancer therapy. The FNA successfully triages these patients into a high-risk category requiring immediate further investigation.\n- A **Negative Result (NPV $\\approx 0.97$)**: An NPV of $0.9706$ indicates that if a patient's FNA is negative, there is a $97.06\\%$ probability that the nodule is indeed benign. The probability of a missed cancer (a false negative) is very low, at $1 - 0.9706 = 0.0294$, or $2.94\\%$. This high level of confidence allows for a de-escalation of clinical management. Instead of proceeding with an invasive biopsy, which carries its own risks and costs, the appropriate clinical pathway is typically conservative surveillance. This may involve follow-up imaging (e.g., ultrasound) at intervals such as $6$ or $12$ months to ensure the nodule remains stable. This strategy effectively and safely spares the great majority of patients with benign nodules from unnecessary invasive procedures, thus minimizing morbidity and healthcare costs.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.7188  0.9706 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4340974"}, {"introduction": "Pathologists rarely rely on a single marker; instead, they use a panel of tests to distinguish between similar-looking diseases, such as different subtypes of lung cancer.
