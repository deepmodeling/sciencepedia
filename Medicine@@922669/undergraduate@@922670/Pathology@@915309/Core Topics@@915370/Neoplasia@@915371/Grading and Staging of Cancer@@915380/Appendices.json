You will practice applying the scoring criteria for tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism, and mitotic activity. This problem specifically challenges you to address a common practical issue in pathology: standardizing mitotic counts when using a microscope with a non-standard field of view, reinforcing the principle that grading is a quantitative science requiring careful methodology [@problem_id:4376317].", "problem": "A surgical pathology specimen of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast is assessed using the Elston–Ellis modification of the Scarff–Bloom–Richardson system (the Nottingham grading system). In this system, three histologic components are scored and summed: tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism, and mitotic count. The tubule formation in this case is quantified at $20\\%$ of the tumor area and is already classified as a score of $3$. Nuclear pleomorphism is described as marked and is already classified as a score of $3$.\n\nFor the mitotic count component, the Nottingham system defines thresholds based on counts per $10$ High-Power Fields (HPF), where High-Power Field (HPF) refers to the microscope’s high magnification field of view. The original thresholds are defined for a microscope with a single HPF area of $A_{0} = 0.196\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ as follows: score $1$ for $0$ to $5$ mitoses per $10$ HPF, score $2$ for $6$ to $10$ mitoses per $10$ HPF, and score $3$ for $\\geq 11$ mitoses per $10$ HPF. A different microscope has an HPF area of $A = 0.237\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$, and in this case the mitotic count measured is $14$ mitoses per $10$ HPF.\n\nUsing first principles about how counts scale with sampled area under the assumption of uniform mitotic density, derive the area-normalized mitotic score for this microscope, then compute the total Nottingham score (the sum of the three component scores) and determine the grade, where total scores of $3$ to $5$ correspond to Grade $1$, $6$ to $7$ to Grade $2$, and $8$ to $9$ to Grade $3$.\n\nExpress your final answer as two numbers in a single row matrix using LaTeX, with the first entry being the total Nottingham score and the second entry being the grade number. No units are required. No rounding of the final answer is required beyond the use of whole-number thresholds intrinsic to the scoring system.", "solution": "The Nottingham grading system sums three components: tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism, and mitotic count, each scored on an ordinal scale of $1$ to $3$. The tubule formation is already given as a score of $3$, and nuclear pleomorphism is already given as a score of $3$.\n\nThe third component, the mitotic count, requires adjustment because the thresholds are defined for a standard microscope field area but the measurement was taken using a microscope with a different High-Power Field (HPF) area. The core principle is that, under the assumption of approximately uniform mitotic figure density across the sampled tumor region, the expected number of mitoses in a field scales linearly with the area examined. Therefore, to apply the original Nottingham thresholds to a different HPF area, one must scale the threshold counts proportionally to the ratio of the HPF areas.\n\nLet $A_{0} = 0.196\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ denote the original HPF area for which the Nottingham thresholds (per $10$ HPF) are defined, and let $A = 0.237\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ denote the HPF area of the microscope used here. The area scaling factor $s$ is\n$$\ns = \\frac{A}{A_{0}} = \\frac{0.237}{0.196} = \\frac{237}{196}.\n$$\nThe original per $10$ HPF threshold counts are $5$, $6$, $10$, and $11$ (marking the upper bound of score $1$, the lower bound of score $2$, the upper bound of score $2$, and the lower bound of score $3$, respectively). To translate these to the current HPF area, multiply each threshold count by $s$:\n$$\n5s = 5 \\cdot \\frac{237}{196} = \\frac{1185}{196} \\approx 6.045918, \\\\\n6s = 6 \\cdot \\frac{237}{196} = \\frac{1422}{196} \\approx 7.255102, \\\\\n10s = 10 \\cdot \\frac{237}{196} = \\frac{2370}{196} \\approx 12.091836, \\\\\n11s = 11 \\cdot \\frac{237}{196} = \\frac{2607}{196} \\approx 13.301020.\n$$\nBecause mitotic counts are integers, threshold application requires whole-number cutpoints. A standard approach is to round these scaled thresholds to the nearest integer to preserve the intended density-based boundaries:\n$$\n\\text{Upper bound for score }1: \\mathrm{round}(5s) = 6, \\\\\n\\text{Lower bound for score }2: \\mathrm{round}(6s) = 7, \\\\\n\\text{Upper bound for score }2: \\mathrm{round}(10s) = 12, \\\\\n\\text{Lower bound for score }3: \\mathrm{round}(11s) = 13.\n$$\nThus, for an HPF area of $A = 0.237\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$, the adjusted thresholds per $10$ HPF are:\n- Score $1$: $0$ to $6$ mitoses,\n- Score $2$: $7$ to $12$ mitoses,\n- Score $3$: $\\geq 13$ mitoses.\n\nThe observed mitotic count is $14$ mitoses per $10$ HPF, which falls into the $\\geq 13$ category, corresponding to a mitotic score of $3$.\n\nNow sum the three component scores:\n$$\n\\text{Total Nottingham score} = 3 \\;(\\text{tubules}) + 3 \\;(\\text{pleomorphism}) + 3 \\;(\\text{mitoses}) = 9.\n$$\nUsing the grade mapping:\n- Total scores $3$ to $5$ correspond to Grade $1$,\n- Total scores $6$ to $7$ correspond to Grade $2$,\n- Total scores $8$ to $9$ correspond to Grade $3$,\n\nthe total score of $9$ yields Grade $3$.\n\nTherefore, the requested output (total score, grade) is:\n- Total Nottingham score: $9$,\n- Grade: $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 9 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4376317"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the intrinsic biology of the tumor (grade) to its anatomical extent (stage), this practice applies the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging system to a case of cutaneous melanoma.
