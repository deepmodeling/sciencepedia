It is scientifically grounded in the standard exponential growth model for early-stage tumors, is well-posed with sufficient data to determine the requested parameters, and is expressed objectively.\n\nThe fundamental premise of the problem is that the instantaneous rate of change of the tumor volume, $V(t)$, is proportional to the current volume. This is described by the first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = rV\n$$\nwhere $r$ is the constant net growth rate parameter in units of inverse time (day$^{-1}$).\n\nFirst, we derive an expression for the growth rate parameter $r$. We can solve the differential equation by separation of variables.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{V} dV = r dt\n$$\nWe integrate this equation between the two measurement time points, $t_1$ and $t_2$, with corresponding volumes $V(t_1)$ and $V(t_2)$.\n$$\n\\int_{V(t_1)}^{V(t_2)} \\frac{1}{V} dV = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} r dt\n$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$\n[\\ln(V)]_{V(t_1)}^{V(t_2)} = [rt]_{t_1}^{t_2}\n$$\nSince tumor volume $V$ is a positive quantity, the absolute value is not needed. Evaluating the limits of integration gives:\n$$\n\\ln(V(t_2)) - \\ln(V(t_1)) = r(t_2 - t_1)\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, we have:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{V(t_2)}{V(t_1)}\\right) = r(t_2 - t_1)\n$$\nSolving for $r$, we obtain the desired expression in terms of the measurements:\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{V(t_2)}{V(t_1)}\\right)}{t_2 - t_1}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $r$ using the provided data: $V(t_1) = 1.20$ cm$^3$ at $t_1 = 0$ days, and $V(t_2) = 1.90$ cm$^3$ at $t_2 = 21$ days.\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1.90}{1.20}\\right)}{21 - 0} = \\frac{\\ln(1.58333...)}{21} \\approx \\frac{0.459532...}{21} \\approx 0.0218825... \\text{ day}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the net growth rate parameter is $r = 0.02188$ day$^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we derive an expression for the doubling time, $T_d$, in terms of $r$. The doubling time is defined as the time interval over which the volume doubles. The general solution to the differential equation is $V(t) = V_0 \\exp(rt)$, where $V_0$ is the volume at $t=0$. We seek the time $t = T_d$ such that $V(T_d) = 2V_0$.\n$$\n2V_0 = V_0 \\exp(r T_d)\n$$\nDividing by the non-zero initial volume $V_0$:\n$$\n2 = \\exp(r T_d)\n$$\nTo solve for $T_d$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln(2) = \\ln(\\exp(r T_d))\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(2) = r T_d\n$$\nThis gives the expression for the doubling time:\n$$\nT_d = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{r}\n$$\nUsing our computed value for $r$, we can now calculate $T_d$:\n$$\nT_d = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.0218825...} \\approx \\frac{0.693147...}{0.0218825...} \\approx 31.675... \\text{ days}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the doubling time is $T_d = 31.68$ days.\n\nFinally, we discuss the identifiability of $r$ when the measurement interval $\\Delta t = t_2 - t_1$ is short relative to the doubling time $T_d$, in the presence of measurement error. Let the true volumes be $V_1$ and $V_2$, and the measured volumes be $\\tilde{V}_1$ and $\\tilde{V}_2$. The measurements include a multiplicative error:\n$$\n\\tilde{V}_1 = V_1 (1 + \\epsilon_1) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\tilde{V}_2 = V_2 (1 + \\epsilon_2)\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon_1$ and $\\epsilon_2$ are independent random error terms with a typical magnitude of $0.05$. The estimated growth rate, $\\tilde{r}$, is calculated from the measured volumes:\n$$\n\\tilde{r} = \\frac{\\ln(\\tilde{V}_2/\\tilde{V}_1)}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{V_2(1+\\epsilon_2)}{V_1(1+\\epsilon_1)}\\right)}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nThe true volumes are related by $V_2 = V_1 \\exp(r \\Delta t)$. Substituting this into the equation for $\\tilde{r}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{r} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{V_1 \\exp(r \\Delta t)(1+\\epsilon_2)}{V_1 (1+\\epsilon_1)}\\right)}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{\\ln(\\exp(r \\Delta t)) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{1+\\epsilon_2}{1+\\epsilon_1}\\right)}{\\Delta t}\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{r} = r + \\frac{\\ln(1+\\epsilon_2) - \\ln(1+\\epsilon_1)}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nThe error in the estimate of $r$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta r = \\tilde{r} - r = \\frac{\\ln(1+\\epsilon_2) - \\ln(1+\\epsilon_1)}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nWhen $\\Delta t$ is short relative to $T_d$, this means $\\Delta t \\ll T_d = \\ln(2)/r$, which implies that the product $r \\Delta t$ is small. For small errors $\\epsilon$ (like $0.05$), the approximation $\\ln(1+\\epsilon) \\approx \\epsilon$ is valid. The error in $r$ becomes:\n$$\n\\Delta r \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon_2 - \\epsilon_1}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nThe numerator, $\\epsilon_2 - \\epsilon_1$, is a term whose magnitude is determined by the fixed measurement uncertainty. For errors of magnitude $0.05$, this difference can range from approximately $-0.1$ to $0.1$. The crucial point is that this fixed-magnitude noise term is amplified by the factor $1/\\Delta t$. As the measurement interval $\\Delta t$ becomes very short, the error $\\Delta r$ can become catastrophically large, as it is inversely proportional to $\\Delta t$.\n\nIn physical terms, when $\\Delta t$ is short, the true change in volume due to growth is very small. For example, if $\\Delta t \\ll T_d$, the volume increase is much less than $100\\%$. With a measurement uncertainty of $\\pm 5\\%$, the random error in the ratio $\\tilde{V}_2/\\tilde{V}_1$ can easily be comparable to or even dominate the actual change due to growth. For instance, if the true growth is only $2\\%$ over the interval, a $+5\\%$ error in $\\tilde{V}_2$ and a $-5\\%$ error in $\\tilde{V}_1$ would suggest a volume ratio of $(1.02 \\times 1.05) / 0.95 \\approx 1.127$, implying a $12.7\\%$ growth. This leads to a gross overestimation of $r$. Conversely, different error signs could lead to an estimated shrinkage (negative $r$). Therefore, the ability to reliably estimate $r$ (its identifiability) degrades severely as the signal (growth, proportional to $\\Delta t$) becomes buried in the noise (measurement uncertainty, which is constant).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.02188  31.68 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4462181"}, {"introduction": "While mathematical models often focus on volume, clinical assessments like the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) rely on one-dimensional diameter measurements.

We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Doubling Time Relationship\nWe are given that the tumor's longest diameter, $D(t)$, follows an exponential growth law. The governing differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dD}{dt} = r_{D}D(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We solve it by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dD}{D(t)} = r_{D} dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from time $t=0$ to a general time $t$, and from initial diameter $D(0) = D_0$ to $D(t)$, we get:\n$$\n\\int_{D_0}^{D(t)} \\frac{1}{D'} dD' = \\int_0^t r_D dt'\n$$\n$$\n[\\ln|D'|]_{D_0}^{D(t)} = [r_D t']_0^t\n$$\nSince diameter is a positive quantity, we have:\n$$\n\\ln(D(t)) - \\ln(D_0) = r_D t\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{D(t)}{D_0}\\right) = r_D t\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the solution for $D(t)$:\n$$\nD(t) = D_0 \\exp(r_D t)\n$$\nThe diameter doubling time, $T_D$, is the time at which $D(T_D) = 2D_0$. Substituting this into the solution:\n$$\n2D_0 = D_0 \\exp(r_D T_D)\n$$\n$$\n2 = \\exp(r_D T_D)\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives the expression for $T_D$:\n$$\n\\ln(2) = r_D T_D \\implies T_D = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{r_D}\n$$\nNext, we analyze the volume, $V(t)$. We are given the relationship $V(t) = s D(t)^3$, where $s$ is a constant shape factor. Substituting our expression for $D(t)$:\n$$\nV(t) = s (D_0 \\exp(r_D t))^3 = s D_0^3 (\\exp(r_D t))^3 = s D_0^3 \\exp(3 r_D t)\n$$\nThe initial volume at $t=0$ is $V_0 = V(0) = s D_0^3 \\exp(0) = sD_0^3$. Therefore, we can write the volume as a function of time as:\n$$\nV(t) = V_0 \\exp((3r_D)t)\n$$\nThis is also an exponential growth law of the form $V(t) = V_0 \\exp(r_V t)$, where the volume growth rate constant is $r_V = 3r_D$.\n\nFollowing the same logic as for the diameter, the volume doubling time, $T_V$, is given by:\n$$\nT_V = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{r_V}\n$$\nSubstituting $r_V = 3r_D$ into this expression:\n$$\nT_V = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{3r_D}\n$$\nNow we can establish the relationship between $T_V$ and $T_D$. We have $T_D = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{r_D}$, so we can write $T_V$ in terms of $T_D$:\n$$\nT_V = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{\\ln(2)}{r_D} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} T_D\n$$\nThe volume doubling time is one-third of the diameter doubling time. The explicit ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{T_V}{T_D} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\n\n### Analysis of RECIST Unidimensional Measurement\nThe analysis is based on the geometric relationship $V = sD^3$. Let $V_0$ be the volume corresponding to the baseline diameter $D_0$, and $V_{\\text{new}}$ be the volume corresponding to the follow-up diameter $D_{\\text{new}}$. The fractional change in volume is:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text{new}} - V_0}{V_0} = \\frac{s D_{\\text{new}}^3 - s D_0^3}{s D_0^3} = \\frac{D_{\\text{new}}^3 - D_0^3}{D_0^3} = \\left(\\frac{D_{\\text{new}}}{D_0}\\right)^3 - 1\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the fractional change in volume is the cube of the fractional change in diameter, minus one. This cubic relationship means that small changes in the unidimensional measurement correspond to much larger changes in the three-dimensional tumor volume, which represents the actual tumor burden.\n\n**Scenario 1: Diameter increase of 20%**\nGiven $D_{\\text{new}} = D_0(1+0.20) = 1.20 D_0$. The ratio $\\frac{D_{\\text{new}}}{D_0} = 1.20$.\nThe fractional change in volume is:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text{new}} - V_0}{V_0} = (1.20)^3 - 1 = 1.728 - 1 = 0.728\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, the fractional change is $0.7280$. This corresponds to a $72.8\\%$ increase in tumor volume.\n\n**Scenario 2: Diameter decrease of 30%**\nGiven $D_{\\text{new}} = D_0(1-0.30) = 0.70 D_0$. The ratio $\\frac{D_{\\text{new}}}{D_0} = 0.70$.\nThe fractional change in volume is:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text{new}} - V_0}{V_0} = (0.70)^3 - 1 = 0.343 - 1 = -0.657\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, the fractional change is $-0.6570$. This corresponds to a $65.7\\%$ decrease in tumor volume.
