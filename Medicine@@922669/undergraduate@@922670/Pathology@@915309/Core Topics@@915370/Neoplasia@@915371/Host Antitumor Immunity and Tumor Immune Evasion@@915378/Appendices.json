The structure is logical and guides a calculation based on fundamental definitions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe goal is to calculate the expected number of presented neoantigens. This will be accomplished in two sequential steps as dictated by the problem's structure.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of somatic mutations in the interrogated portion of the tumor genome. Let $N_{mut}$ represent this total number. According to the provided definition, the total number of mutations is the product of the tumor mutational burden ($T$) and the effective interrogated length ($L$).\n\n$$N_{mut} = T \\times L$$\n\nThe givens are $T = 12 \\text{ mutations/Mb}$ and $L = 3{,}000 \\text{ Mb}$. Substituting these values into the equation:\n\n$$N_{mut} = 12 \\frac{\\text{mutations}}{\\text{Mb}} \\times 3{,}000 \\text{ Mb}$$\n\nThe units of megabases (Mb) cancel, yielding a dimensionless count of mutations:\n\n$$N_{mut} = 12 \\times 3{,}000 = 36{,}000$$\n\nThus, there are a total of $36{,}000$ somatic mutations in the sequenced portion of the tumor.\n\nSecond, we determine the expected number of these mutations that result in a presented neoantigen. The problem states that each mutation is an independent event and can be modeled as a Bernoulli trial.\n- The number of independent trials, $n$, corresponds to the total number of mutations, so $n = N_{mut} = 36{,}000$.\n- The probability of success for any given trial, $p$, is the effective yield, $y$. The given yield is $y = 1\\%$. This probability must be expressed as a dimensionless number for calculation:\n\n$$p = y = 1\\% = \\frac{1}{100} = 0.01$$\n\nThe problem explicitly directs us to use the formula for the expected value of a binomial distribution, which is the sum of expectations of the individual Bernoulli trials. For $n$ trials with success probability $p$, the expected number of successes, denoted here as $E[N_{neo}]$, is:\n\n$$E[N_{neo}] = n \\times p$$\n\nSubstituting the values for $n$ and $p$:\n\n$$E[N_{neo}] = 36{,}000 \\times 0.01$$\n\nPerforming the multiplication gives the final result:\n\n$$E[N_{neo}] = 360$$\n\nTherefore, the expected number of presented neoantigens for this patient is $360$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{360}$$", "id": "4382722"}, {"introduction": "The fight between the immune system and a growing tumor is a dynamic process, not a static event. To understand the factors that determine whether the tumor is eliminated or escapes control, we can use mathematical models to simulate this \"predator-prey\" interaction. This exercise uses a Lotka–Volterra-like system to explore how parameters like tumor growth rate, T-cell killing efficiency, and immune cell expansion influence the long-term outcome of the battle [@problem_id:4382752].", "problem": "A tumor is infiltrated by cytotoxic effector T lymphocytes. To capture early dynamics before strong resource limitation or spatial constraints, use two principles from population biology and immunology as the fundamental base: (i) in the absence of control, tumor cells divide proportionally to their current number, and (ii) immune-mediated killing arises from encounters between effector T cells and tumor cells.

Its application to tumor-immune dynamics is a standard and well-established approach in mathematical biology and immunology. The tumor cells ($T$) act as the \"prey,\" which grow on their own and are consumed by the \"predator,\" the effector T cells ($E$). The predators ($E$) grow in proportion to the availability of prey ($T$) and have a natural death rate. The problem explicitly states the model is for \"early dynamics,\" which justifies the use of exponential growth for the tumor ($rT$) rather than logistic growth, as carrying capacity has not been reached. The assumptions are clear, and the model is a valid, albeit simplified, representation of the described biological interactions.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The system is a pair of coupled, first-order, autonomous ordinary differential equations. Given initial conditions for $T$ and $E$, a unique solution exists. The problem of analyzing its steady states and the effect of parameter changes is well-posed.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise mathematical terms and defined biological interpretations. There is no subjective, ambiguous, or opinion-based language in the problem setup.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically and mathematically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Steady States\n\nTo analyze the options, we first find the steady states of the system by setting the time derivatives to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = 0 \\implies rT - kET = 0 \\implies T(r - kE) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dt} = 0 \\implies \\alpha T - \\delta E = 0\n$$\nFrom the first equation, we have two possibilities: $T = 0$ or $r - kE = 0$.\n\n1.  **Trivial (Tumor-Free) Steady State:** If $T=0$, the second equation becomes $\\alpha(0) - \\delta E = 0$, which implies $E = 0$ (since $\\delta > 0$). This gives the steady state $(T, E) = (0, 0)$.\n\n2.  **Nontrivial (Coexistence) Steady State:** If $T \\neq 0$, the first equation requires $r - kE = 0$, which yields $E = \\frac{r}{k}$. We denote this steady-state value as $E^*$. Substituting this into the second equation gives:\n    $$\n    \\alpha T - \\delta \\left(\\frac{r}{k}\\right) = 0 \\implies \\alpha T = \\frac{r\\delta}{k} \\implies T = \\frac{r\\delta}{\\alpha k}\n    $$\n    We denote this as $T^*$. Thus, the nontrivial coexistence steady state is $(T^*, E^*) = \\left(\\frac{r\\delta}{\\alpha k}, \\frac{r}{k}\\right)$. Since all parameters $r, k, \\alpha, \\delta$ are positive, both $T^*$ and $E^*$ are positive.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In this model, Programmed death-ligand $1$ (PD-L1) expression by tumor cells primarily reduces $\\alpha$ by lowering effector T cell recruitment from antigen-presenting cells.**\n\n-   **Biological Rationale:** PD-L1 on tumor cells binds to its receptor PD-1 on effector T cells. This interaction occurs within the tumor microenvironment and delivers an inhibitory signal. The primary consequences of this signal are the suppression of the T cell's cytotoxic function and the induction of T cell anergy, exhaustion, or apoptosis (programmed cell death).\n-   **Mapping to Model Parameters:**\n    -   Suppression of cytotoxic function corresponds to a decrease in the killing rate parameter $k$.\n    -   Induction of T cell apoptosis corresponds to an increase in the T cell loss rate $\\delta$.\n    -   Suppression of T cell proliferation in response to antigen could be represented by a decrease in $\\alpha$.\n-   **Critique:** The statement claims the *primary* effect is a reduction in $\\alpha$ and attributes it to a specific mechanism: \"lowering effector T cell recruitment from antigen-presenting cells.\" This mechanism (priming by APCs) largely occurs in the lymph nodes, not the tumor microenvironment where tumor cell PD-L1 acts. The effect of tumor cell PD-L1 is most direct on the T cells already at the tumor site, thus impacting their killing ability ($k$) and survival ($\\delta$). While T-cell expansion (related to $\\alpha$) is also inhibited, attributing the primary effect to reduced recruitment from APCs is biologically imprecise. The most direct and widely accepted effects are on $k$ and $\\delta$. Therefore, this statement misrepresents the primary mechanism and site of action of tumor cell PD-L1.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Immune checkpoint blockade that restores cytotoxic T lymphocyte killing increases $k$ and lowers the nontrivial steady-state tumor burden $T^\\*$ predicted by the model.**\n\n-   **Biological Rationale:** Immune checkpoint blockade (e.g., with anti-PD-1 antibodies) prevents the inhibitory signal, thus \"releasing the brakes\" on effector T cells and restoring their ability to kill tumor cells.\n-   **Mapping to Model Parameters:** Restoring cytotoxic killing is directly modeled by an increase in the killing rate parameter, $k$.\n-   **Mathematical Consequence:** The nontrivial steady-state tumor burden is $T^* = \\frac{r\\delta}{\\alpha k}$. If $k$ increases, holding other parameters constant, the denominator increases, and thus $T^*$ decreases.\n-   **Conclusion:** The statement correctly links the biological action of checkpoint blockade to an increase in $k$ and accurately predicts the resulting decrease in the steady-state tumor population $T^*$.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**C. Tumor antigen loss reduces $r$, because fewer immunogenic tumor clones divide.**\n\n-   **Biological Rationale:** Tumor antigen loss is an immune escape mechanism where tumor cells reduce or eliminate the surface antigens recognized by T cells. This makes the tumor \"invisible\" to the immune system.\n-   **Mapping to Model Parameters:**\n    -   The parameter $r$ represents the intrinsic, immune-independent growth rate of the tumor. Tumor cell division is driven by oncogenes and loss of tumor suppressors, not by the presence of antigens on their surface. Therefore, antigen loss does not affect $r$.\n    -   The immune system's ability to recognize and respond to the tumor depends on antigens. Thus, antigen loss would reduce the stimulus for T-cell expansion (decreasing $\\alpha$) and/or the efficiency of killing upon encounter (decreasing $k$).\n-   **Conclusion:** The statement incorrectly claims that antigen loss reduces $r$. The parameter $r$ is independent of the tumor's immunogenicity.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. High myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) increase the effective $\\delta$, leading to decreased steady-state $E$ for a given $T$.**\n\n-   **Biological Rationale:** MDSCs are immunosuppressive cells that accumulate in the tumor microenvironment. A key mechanism of their function is the induction of apoptosis in effector T cells.\n-   **Mapping to Model Parameters:** Inducing T-cell apoptosis directly translates to an increase in the T-cell loss rate, $\\delta$.\n-   **Mathematical Consequence:** The phrase \"steady-state $E$ for a given $T$\" refers to the relationship described by the $E$-nullcline ($\\frac{dE}{dt} = 0$). This relationship is $\\alpha T - \\delta E = 0$, or $E = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta} T$. This equation describes the level of effector cells $E$ that can be maintained at equilibrium for a given tumor burden $T$. If MDSCs increase the effective value of $\\delta$, the ratio $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta}$ decreases. Consequently, for any fixed value of $T$, the corresponding steady-state level of $E$ decreases.\n-   **Conclusion:** The statement correctly links the biological role of MDSCs to an increase in $\\delta$ and correctly deduces the mathematical consequence on the relationship between $E$ and $T$.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**E. The coexistence steady state satisfies $E^\\* = \\frac{r}{k}$ and $T^\\* = \\frac{r\\delta}{\\alpha k}$; therefore, for fixed $r$ and $\\delta$, doubling $\\alpha$ to $2\\alpha$ halves $T^\\*$.**\n\n-   **Mathematical Analysis:**\n    1.  The first part of the statement gives the coordinates of the coexistence steady state: $(T^*, E^*) = (\\frac{r\\delta}{\\alpha k}, \\frac{r}{k})$. As derived above, this is correct.\n    2.  The second part examines the effect of changing $\\alpha$. Let the initial tumor burden be $T^*_{initial} = \\frac{r\\delta}{\\alpha k}$. If we replace $\\alpha$ with $2\\alpha$, the new steady-state tumor burden becomes $T^*_{new} = \\frac{r\\delta}{(2\\alpha)k}$.\n    3.  Comparing the two, we see that $T^*_{new} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{r\\delta}{\\alpha k} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} T^*_{initial}$. So, doubling $\\alpha$ does indeed halve $T^*$.\n-   **Biological Interpretation:** Increasing $\\alpha$ means the immune system is more effective at expanding its army of effector T cells in response to tumor antigens. A more robust response is expected to control the tumor more effectively, leading to a smaller equilibrium tumor size. The mathematical result is consistent with this biological intuition.\n-   **Conclusion:** The statement provides the correct formula for the steady state and correctly calculates the effect of a parameter change.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BDE}$$", "id": "4382752"}, {"introduction": "Tumors can evade destruction by co-opting natural 'brakes' on the immune system, such as the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint pathway, which inactivates tumor-specific T cells.
