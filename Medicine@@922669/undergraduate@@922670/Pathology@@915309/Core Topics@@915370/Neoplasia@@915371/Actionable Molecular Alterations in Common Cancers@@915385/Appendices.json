According to standard American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) dual-probe In Situ Hybridization (ISH) methodology, the HER2/CEP17 ratio is defined as the ratio of the mean HER2 signal count per nucleus to the mean Chromosome Enumeration Probe 17 (CEP17) signal count per nucleus, computed over the same set of nuclei.

It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first calculating the necessary metrics from the provided data and then applying the standard ASCO/CAP classification criteria.\n\n**1. Calculation of Average HER2 Gene Copy Number per Nucleus**\nLet $\\bar{N}_{HER2}$ represent the average HER2 signal count per nucleus. This is calculated by dividing the total number of HER2 signals by the total number of nuclei scored.\n$$ \\bar{N}_{HER2} = \\frac{\\text{Total HER2 signals}}{\\text{Number of nuclei scored}} = \\frac{S_{HER2}}{N} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\bar{N}_{HER2} = \\frac{112}{20} = 5.6 $$\nThe average HER2 gene copy number per nucleus is exactly $5.6$. To three significant figures, this is $5.60$.\n\n**2. Calculation of Average CEP17 Signal Count per Nucleus**\nLet $\\bar{N}_{CEP17}$ represent the average CEP17 signal count per nucleus. This is calculated by dividing the total number of CEP17 signals by the total number of nuclei scored.\n$$ \\bar{N}_{CEP17} = \\frac{\\text{Total CEP17 signals}}{\\text{Number of nuclei scored}} = \\frac{S_{CEP17}}{N} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\bar{N}_{CEP17} = \\frac{58}{20} = 2.9 $$\n\n**3. Calculation of the HER2/CEP17 Ratio**\nThe HER2/CEP17 ratio, denoted as $R$, is defined as the ratio of the mean HER2 signal count to the mean CEP17 signal count.\n$$ R = \\frac{\\bar{N}_{HER2}}{\\bar{N}_{CEP17}} $$\nUsing the calculated mean values:\n$$ R = \\frac{5.6}{2.9} = \\frac{112/20}{58/20} = \\frac{112}{58} \\approx 1.931034... $$\nThe HER2/CEP17 ratio, to three significant figures, is $1.93$.\n\n**4. Classification based on ASCO/CAP 2018 Dual-Probe ISH Guidelines**\nThe problem requires classification into one of five ISH groups based solely on the ISH results, without concurrent immunohistochemistry (IHC) results. The classification is performed using the exact (unrounded) computed values for $\\bar{N}_{HER2}$ and $R$. The 2018 ASCO/CAP guidelines define the groups as follows:\n\n- **Group 1 (Positive):** $R \\ge 2.0$ AND $\\bar{N}_{HER2} \\ge 4.0$\n- **Group 2 (Positive):** $R \\ge 2.0$ AND $\\bar{N}_{HER2} < 4.0$\n- **Group 3 (Positive):** $R < 2.0$ AND $\\bar{N}_{HER2} \\ge 6.0$\n- **Group 4 (Equivocal):** $R < 2.0$ AND $4.0 \\le \\bar{N}_{HER2} < 6.0$\n- **Group 5 (Negative):** $R < 2.0$ AND $\\bar{N}_{HER2} < 4.0$\n\nWe will now test the computed values against these criteria:\n- Calculated $\\bar{N}_{HER2} = 5.6$\n- Calculated $R = \\frac{112}{58} \\approx 1.931$\n\nWe evaluate the conditions for each group:\n- **Group 1:** The condition $R \\ge 2.0$ is not met, since $1.931 < 2.0$.\n- **Group 2:** The condition $R \\ge 2.0$ is not met.\n- **Group 3:** The condition $R < 2.0$ is met. However, the condition $\\bar{N}_{HER2} \\ge 6.0$ is not met, since $5.6 < 6.0$.\n- **Group 4:** The condition $R < 2.0$ is met ($1.931 < 2.0$). The condition $4.0 \\le \\bar{N}_{HER2} < 6.0$ is also met, since $4.0 \\le 5.6 < 6.0$. Both conditions for Group $4$ are satisfied.\n- **Group 5:** The condition $R < 2.0$ is met. However, the condition $\\bar{N}_{HER2} < 4.0$ is not met, since $5.6 > 4.0$.\n\nBased on this rigorous application of the guidelines, the case falls into Group 4. Clinically, a Group 4 (equivocal) result would prompt additional workup, such as performing IHC or recounting with an expanded number of nuclei, but the classification based on the initial data is unequivocally Group 4. The problem asks only for this initial classification.\n\nThe final requested answer is the integer representing the ISH Group number.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "4314087"}, {"introduction": "The Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) reported by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is a powerful but complex piece of data, reflecting not only the genetics of the tumor but also the purity of the specimen. To truly understand a tumor's composition, we must learn to deconstruct the VAF. This problem guides you through deriving the fundamental equation that links the observed VAF ($v$) to tumor purity ($p$) and the Cancer Cell Fraction ($f$)—the actual percentage of cancer cells harboring a mutation [@problem_id:4314141]. Mastering this model is the key to unlocking deeper insights from sequencing reports.", "problem": "A diffuse glioma specimen is profiled by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). The Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) for the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) p.R132H substitution is observed to be $v=0.32$. Histopathology and computational deconvolution estimate the tumor purity to be $p=0.80$, meaning that $0.80$ of nucleated cells in the specimen are neoplastic. Copy number analysis shows that the IDH1 locus resides in a copy-number-neutral diploid segment without Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH), so the total copy number in tumor cells is $2$ and the normal cells are diploid. In gliomas, IDH1 p.R132H is typically heterozygous in the cells that carry it.\n\nStarting explicitly from the definition of VAF as the ratio of mutant allele counts to total allele counts in a mixed population of tumor and normal cells, and from the stated copy number status, derive an expression for the fraction $f$ of tumor cells that harbor the heterozygous IDH1 p.R132H mutation. Then, compute $f$ using the provided values for $v$ and $p$. Express your final numeric answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures. No units are required.", "solution": "The problem requires us to derive an expression for $f$, the fraction of tumor cells harboring a heterozygous mutation, based on the observed Variant Allele Fraction ($v$) and the tumor purity ($p$), and then to calculate its value.\n\nLet us begin by precisely defining the quantities involved. The Variant Allele Fraction, $v$, is defined as the ratio of the number of sequencing reads corresponding to the mutant allele to the total number of reads covering that genomic locus. In an idealized model, this corresponds to the ratio of the number of mutant alleles to the total number of alleles in the cell sample.\n$$v = \\frac{\\text{Number of mutant alleles}}{\\text{Total number of alleles}}$$\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of nucleated cells in the specimen. The specimen is a mixture of neoplastic (tumor) cells and non-neoplastic (normal) cells.\nThe tumor purity, $p$, is given as the fraction of nucleated cells that are neoplastic.\n- Number of tumor cells, $N_T = pN$\n- Number of normal cells, $N_N = (1-p)N$\n\nThe problem states that the IDH1 locus is in a copy-number-neutral diploid segment for both tumor and normal cells. This implies that every cell in the sample contains exactly $2$ copies of the IDH1 gene locus.\nTherefore, the total number of alleles in the entire sample is:\n$$N_{\\text{total_alleles}} = 2 \\times N_T + 2 \\times N_N = 2(pN) + 2(1-p)N = 2pN + 2N - 2pN = 2N$$\n\nNext, we establish the number of mutant alleles. The mutation is the IDH1 p.R132H substitution.\n- Normal cells ($N_N$) do not carry the mutation. They are genetically wild-type at this locus. Thus, the number of mutant alleles in the normal cell population is $0$.\n- The tumor cell population ($N_T$) is itself a mixture. Let $f$ be the fraction of tumor cells that harbor the mutation.\n  - The number of mutated tumor cells is $f \\times N_T = f p N$. The problem states that this mutation is heterozygous in the cells that carry it. This means each mutated cell contains $1$ mutant allele and $1$ wild-type allele.\n  - The number of non-mutated tumor cells is $(1-f) \\times N_T = (1-f) p N$. These cells contain $2$ wild-type alleles and $0$ mutant alleles.\n\nThe total number of mutant alleles in the sample, $N_{\\text{mutant_alleles}}$, is contributed solely by the mutated tumor cells.\n$$N_{\\text{mutant_alleles}} = (\\text{Number of mutated tumor cells}) \\times (\\text{Number of mutant alleles per mutated cell})$$\n$$N_{\\text{mutant_alleles}} = (f p N) \\times 1 = fpN$$\n\nNow, we can substitute our expressions for the number of mutant alleles and the total number of alleles into the definition of VAF:\n$$v = \\frac{N_{\\text{mutant_alleles}}}{N_{\\text{total_alleles}}} = \\frac{fpN}{2N}$$\n\nThe total number of cells, $N$, cancels from the numerator and denominator, yielding the relationship between $v$, $f$, and $p$:\n$$v = \\frac{fp}{2}$$\n\nThe first part of the problem asks for an expression for $f$.

The analysis may proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Cancer Cell Fraction (CCF)\nLet us derive the relationship between the observed Variant Allele Fraction (VAF), tumor purity ($p$), and the Cancer Cell Fraction (CCF) from first principles, given the provided conditions.\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of cells in the sequenced specimen.\nThe number of tumor cells, $N_T$, is given by $N_T = p \\times N$.\nThe number of normal cells, $N_N$, is given by $N_N = (1 - p) \\times N$.\n\nThe total number of alleles at the BRAF locus in the specimen is the sum of alleles from normal and tumor cells.\n- Each normal cell is diploid (CN $= 2$), so the number of alleles from normal cells is $2 \\times N_N = 2(1 - p)N$.\n- Each tumor cell is also diploid at this locus (total CN $= 2$), so the number of alleles from tumor cells is $2 \\times N_T = 2 p N$.\n- The total number of alleles in the sample is $2(1 - p)N + 2 p N = 2N$.\n\nThe total number of mutant alleles in the specimen is determined by the fraction of tumor cells containing the mutation (CCF) and the number of mutant copies per cell.\n- Normal cells contain no mutant alleles.\n- The BRAF locus in the tumor is described as balanced (major CN $= 1$, minor CN $= 1$).

By definition, a mutation present in all cancer cells is considered **clonal**.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The simplest model is a clonal heterozygous BRAF p.V600E (one mutant copy in essentially all tumor cells), consistent with the observed VAF; this supports a higher probability of an objective response to combined BRAF and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase (MEK) inhibition.**\nOur derivation shows that the Cancer Cell Fraction (CCF) is $1.0$, which means the mutation is clonal (present in all tumor cells). The problem states the locus is copy-number neutral and balanced, consistent with a heterozygous state (one mutant copy). A clonal, heterozygous mutation in a sample with $50\\%$ purity is expected to have a VAF of $(1.0 \\times 0.5) / 2 = 0.25$, which perfectly matches the observed VAF. BRAF p.V600E is a known driver mutation in melanoma. A clonal driver mutation implies that the entire tumor population is dependent on its signaling pathway for survival and proliferation. Targeting such a pathway with appropriate inhibitors (combined BRAF and MEK inhibition is the standard of care) is expected to have a high probability of inducing an objective response. This statement is fully consistent with the data and established clinical principles.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The mutation is subclonal, present in approximately $50\\%$ of tumor cells under a diploid model; therefore, BRAF-targeted therapy is unlikely to produce any radiographic response.**\nThis option claims the mutation is subclonal with a CCF of approximately $0.5$. If this were true, the expected VAF would be $\\text{VAF} = (\\text{CCF} \\times p) / 2 = (0.5 \\times 0.5) / 2 = 0.125$. This theoretical VAF of $0.125$ does not match the observed VAF of $0.25$. Therefore, the premise that the mutation is subclonal at this level is incorrect. As our calculation showed, the mutation is clonal.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The observation can only be explained by copy-number amplification of the mutant allele leading to at least two mutant copies in each tumor cell; this predicts poor response due to paradoxical Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway activation.**\nThis option claims copy-number amplification is necessary to explain the VAF. This directly contradicts the explicit problem statement that \"the BRAF locus is copy-number neutral (total CN $= 2$) with balanced allelic state (major allele CN $= 1$, minor allele CN $= 1$)\". Our derivation shows that the VAF of $0.25$ is perfectly explained by the simple clonal heterozygous model without any need to invoke copy number changes. Therefore, this statement is factually inconsistent with the provided data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The VAF is consistent with a germline heterozygous variant diluted by tumor purity; therapy targeting BRAF should be avoided because it is not actionable in this context.**\nA germline heterozygous variant would be present in every cell of the body (both normal and tumor). In such a case, every cell would contribute one mutant and one wild-type allele. The VAF would be the ratio of mutant alleles to total alleles across the entire sample, which would be $\\frac{1 \\times (N_N + N_T)}{2 \\times (N_N + N_T)} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$. The observed VAF is $0.25$, not $0.5$. Therefore, the data are inconsistent with a germline variant. Furthermore, the claim that a BRAF V600E mutation is \"not actionable\" is false; it is a prime example of an actionable target in melanoma.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4314101"}]}
