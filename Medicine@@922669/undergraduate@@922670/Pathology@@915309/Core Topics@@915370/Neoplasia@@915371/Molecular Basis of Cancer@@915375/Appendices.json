It is well-posed, with all necessary definitions, variables, and conditions provided to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The problem's structure is logical and its language is objective and precise.\n\nThe task is to derive an expression for the net mutation rate, $ \\mu_{\\text{net}} $, and then calculate the fold-increase in this rate when Mismatch Repair (MMR) is lost, relative to a normal, proficient state.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for $ \\mu_{\\text{net}} $. A mutation is defined as the result of two sequential and independent events:\n$1$. The occurrence of a base-base mismatch during DNA replication. The rate of this event per base per division is given as $ \\mu $. We can treat this as the probability of a mismatch occurring at any given base during one replication cycle.\n$2$. The failure of the MMR pathway to correct this mismatch. The efficiency of MMR is $ \\eta $, which represents the fraction of mismatches that are corrected. Therefore, the fraction of mismatches that escape correction is $ 1 - \\eta $. This is the probability that a given mismatch is not repaired.\n\nThe problem states that these two events are independent. According to the rules of probability, the probability of two independent events both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. The net mutation rate, $ \\mu_{\\text{net}} $, is the rate at which mismatches both occur and escape repair. Thus, we can express $ \\mu_{\\text{net}} $ as:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{net}} = (\\text{rate of mismatch generation}) \\times (\\text{probability of escaping correction})\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{net}} = \\mu \\times (1 - \\eta)\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the net mutation rate per base per division.\n\nNext, we are asked to compute the fold-increase in the net mutation rate when the MMR pathway is lost compared to its proficient state. The fold-increase, $ F $, is the ratio of the mutation rate in the MMR-deficient state to the rate in the MMR-proficient state.\n\nLet $ \\mu_{\\text{net, deficient}} $ be the net mutation rate when the MMR pathway is lost. This corresponds to a repair efficiency of $ \\eta = 0 $. Substituting this into our derived expression:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{net, deficient}} = \\mu (1 - 0) = \\mu\n$$\nThis result is biologically intuitive: if the repair mechanism is completely absent, the net mutation rate equals the raw error rate of DNA replication.\n\nLet $ \\mu_{\\text{net, proficient}} $ be the net mutation rate in the normal, MMR-proficient state. The problem provides a typical efficiency for this state as $ \\eta_{0} = 0.999 $. The net rate is therefore:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{net, proficient}} = \\mu (1 - \\eta_{0})\n$$\n\nThe fold-increase $ F $ is the ratio of these two rates:\n$$\nF = \\frac{\\mu_{\\text{net, deficient}}}{\\mu_{\\text{net, proficient}}} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\mu (1 - \\eta_{0})}\n$$\nThe raw mismatch rate $ \\mu $ cancels from the expression, indicating that the fold-increase depends only on the efficiency of the repair pathway:\n$$\nF = \\frac{1}{1 - \\eta_{0}}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical value for the proficient MMR efficiency, $ \\eta_{0} = 0.999 $:\n$$\nF = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.999} = \\frac{1}{0.001} = 1000\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be reported as a unitless number rounded to three significant figures.

The scenario described is a canonical example used in systems biology to model oncogenic signaling.

Verdict:**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Solution\n\nLet $[L]$ denote the concentration of the ligand EGF, $[R_{\\text{free}}]$ denote the surface density of free (unbound) receptors, and $[C]$ denote the surface density of ligand-receptor complexes. The binding reaction is:\n$$ L + R_{\\text{free}} \\underset{k_{\\text{off}}}{\\stackrel{k_{\\text{on}}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} C $$\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rate of formation of the complex is given by $v_{\\text{form}} = k_{\\text{on}} [L] [R_{\\text{free}}]$. The rate of dissociation of the complex is $v_{\\text{diss}} = k_{\\text{off}} [C]$.\n\n**Applying Assumption (i): Steady State**\nAt steady state, the net rate of change of the complex concentration is zero, meaning the rate of formation equals the rate of dissociation:\n$$ v_{\\text{form}} = v_{\\text{diss}} $$\n$$ k_{\\text{on}} [L] [R_{\\text{free}}] = k_{\\text{off}} [C]_{\\text{ss}} $$\nwhere $[C]_{\\text{ss}}$ is the steady-state surface density of the ligand-receptor complex.\n\n**Applying Assumption (ii): Low Receptor Occupancy**\nWe are given that the ligand concentration is $L$, so $[L]=L$. The total receptor density is $R$, which is the sum of free and bound receptors: $R = [R_{\\text{free}}] + [C]$. The assumption of low receptor occupancy means that $[C] \\ll R$. This allows for the approximation that the density of free receptors is nearly equal to the total density of receptors:\n$$ [R_{\\text{free}}] \\approx R $$\n\nSubstituting $[L] = L$ and $[R_{\\text{free}}] \\approx R$ into the steady-state equation gives:\n$$ k_{\\text{on}} L R \\approx k_{\\text{off}} [C]_{\\text{ss}} $$\n\nSolving for the steady-state complex density $[C]_{\\text{ss}}$:\n$$ [C]_{\\text{ss}} \\approx \\frac{k_{\\text{on}}}{k_{\\text{off}}} L R $$\nThis can also be written in terms of the dissociation constant $K_D = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}}$:\n$$ [C]_{\\text{ss}} \\approx \\frac{LR}{K_D} $$\n\n**Applying Assumption (iii): Proportionality of Kinase Activity**\nThe downstream kinase activity, $A$, is proportional to the steady-state *number* of ligand-bound receptors. The number of receptors is the surface density multiplied by the cell surface area, $S_{\\text{area}}$. Let $\\gamma$ be the proportionality constant.\n$$ A = \\gamma \\cdot (\\text{Number of complexes}) = \\gamma \\cdot ([C]_{\\text{ss}} \\cdot S_{\\text{area}}) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $[C]_{\\text{ss}}$:\n$$ A \\approx \\gamma \\cdot \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{on}}}{k_{\\text{off}}} L R \\right) \\cdot S_{\\text{area}} $$\nSince $\\gamma$, $k_{\\text{on}}$, $k_{\\text{off}}$, and $S_{\\text{area}}$ are constants for a given cell type and conditions, we can group them into a single effective proportionality constant, $k_{\\text{eff}} = \\gamma \\frac{k_{\\text{on}}}{k_{\\text{off}}} S_{\\text{area}}$.\n$$ A \\approx k_{\\text{eff}} L R $$\nThis result shows how $A$ scales with $L$ and $R$: under the given assumptions, the downstream kinase activity is directly and linearly proportional to both the ligand concentration $L$ and the total receptor density $R$.\n\n**Calculating the Fold-Change**\nNow we calculate the fold-change in activity $A$ when the receptor expression doubles. Let the initial state be $(A_1, R_1)$ and the final state be $(A_2, R_2)$, with $L$ held constant.\nInitial activity: $A_1 \\approx k_{\\text{eff}} L R_1$. We are given $R_1=R$.\n$$ A_1 \\approx k_{\\text{eff}} L R $$\nFinal activity: The receptor expression doubles, so $R_2 = 2R_1 = 2R$.\n$$ A_2 \\approx k_{\\text{eff}} L R_2 = k_{\\text{eff}} L (2R) = 2(k_{\\text{eff}} L R) $$\nComparing $A_2$ to $A_1$:\n$$ A_2 \\approx 2 A_1 $$\nThe fold-change is the ratio of the final activity to the initial activity:\n$$ \\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{A_2}{A_1} \\approx \\frac{2 A_1}{A_1} = 2 $$\nThe fold-change is exactly $2$.\n\n**Implication for Oncogenic Gain-of-Function**\nThis result demonstrates a fundamental mechanism of oncogenic gain-of-function through gene amplification. The derivation shows that, in a regime where signaling molecule availability is not the limiting factor (implicit in the low occupancy assumption), the signaling output ($A$) is directly proportional to the amount of receptor protein ($R$). Doubling the receptor density on the cell surface leads to a doubling of the downstream proliferative signal, even with no change in the external concentration of the growth factor ($L$). This makes the cell hyper-responsive to normal, physiological levels of cues in its microenvironment. In the context of pathology, this means an oncogene like EGFR, when overexpressed, amplifies a normal signal into a potent, unregulated stimulus for cell growth and division, contributing directly to the uncontrolled proliferation that is a hallmark of cancer. The cell's signaling machinery is pathologically re-wired such that its output is dictated more by the aberrant quantity of its internal components (the overexpressed receptor) than by the external physiological signals it is meant to transduce.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "4408518"}, {"introduction": "Targeted therapies are designed to inhibit the specific oncoproteins driving a cancer, but their effectiveness can be limited by the evolution of drug resistance.
