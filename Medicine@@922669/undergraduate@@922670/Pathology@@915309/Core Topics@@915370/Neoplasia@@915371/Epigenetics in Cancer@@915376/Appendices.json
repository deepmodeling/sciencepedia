In sodium bisulfite treatment, unmethylated cytosines are deaminated to uracils that are sequenced as thymines, whereas methylated cytosines resist conversion and are sequenced as cytosines. To quantify methylation at a single CpG site, the laboratory reports the observed methylation proportion as the fraction of sequencing reads called as cytosine among all reads covering that position. You are given that the observed methylation proportion at this CpG is $0.62$. Independent spike-in controls establish a bisulfite conversion efficiency of $0.992$ (the probability that an unmethylated cytosine converts prior to sequencing). The per-base sequencing base-calling error rate is $0.005$, modeled symmetrically as follows: conditional on the true base presented to the sequencer after bisulfite conversion, the called base flips between cytosine and thymine with probability $e$, and is correct with probability $1 - e$. Assume all other error modes are negligible for the purpose of this site-level calculation.\n\nUsing these well-tested principles of bisulfite sequencing chemistry and base-calling, derive from first principles an expression for the true underlying methylation fraction $m$ at this CpG site in terms of the observed methylation proportion $m_{\\text{obs}}$, the conversion efficiency $c$, and the base-calling error rate $e$.

Consequently, the fraction of unmethylated molecules is $1 - m$.\n\nLet $m_{\\text{obs}}$ be the observed methylation proportion, which is defined as the probability of a sequencing read being called as a cytosine (C) at this position. We can express this probability using the law of total probability, conditioning on the true methylation state (Methylated, M, or Unmethylated, U) of the original DNA molecule.\n\n$$m_{\\text{obs}} = P(\\text{Read C}) = P(\\text{Read C} | \\text{True M}) P(\\text{True M}) + P(\\text{Read C} | \\text{True U}) P(\\text{True U})$$\n\nThe prior probabilities of the true states are given by the true methylation fraction:\n- $P(\\text{True M}) = m$\n- $P(\\text{True U}) = 1 - m$\n\nNow, we must determine the conditional probabilities based on the two-step process of bisulfite conversion and sequencing.\n\n1.  **Conditional probability of reading C, given the site was truly methylated ($P(\\text{Read C} | \\text{True M})$):**\n    If the site is methylated, it is not converted by bisulfite treatment and remains a cytosine. For this to be observed as a cytosine, the sequencer must not make an error. The base-calling error rate is $e$, so the probability of a correct call is $1 - e$.\n    $$P(\\text{Read C} | \\text{True M}) = 1 - e$$\n\n2.  **Conditional probability of reading C, given the site was truly unmethylated ($P(\\text{Read C} | \\text{True U})$):**\n    If the site is unmethylated, two events can lead to it being read as a cytosine:\n    a) The bisulfite conversion fails, and the sequencer correctly reads the resulting cytosine. The probability of conversion failure is $1 - c$. The probability of a correct read is $1 - e$. The probability of this path is $(1 - c)(1 - e)$.\n    b) The bisulfite conversion succeeds, converting the cytosine to a uracil (which is treated as a thymine, T, by the sequencer), but the sequencer then makes an error and calls it as a cytosine. The probability of successful conversion is $c$. The probability of this specific sequencing error (T to C) is $e$. The probability of this path is $c \\cdot e$.\n\n    The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events:\n    $$P(\\text{Read C} | \\text{True U}) = (1 - c)(1 - e) + c \\cdot e$$\n\nNow, we substitute these conditional probabilities back into the main equation for $m_{\\text{obs}}$:\n$$m_{\\text{obs}} = (1 - e) \\cdot m + ((1 - c)(1 - e) + c \\cdot e) \\cdot (1 - m)$$\n\nOur goal is to solve this equation for $m$.
