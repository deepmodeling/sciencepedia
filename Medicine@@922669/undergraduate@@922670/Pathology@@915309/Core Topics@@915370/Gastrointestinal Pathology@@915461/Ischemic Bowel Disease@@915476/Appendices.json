It is based on the Hagen–Poiseuille relationship from fluid dynamics, a standard model for blood flow in small vessels. All necessary information is provided to compute the requested quantity.\n\nThe problem states that for a straight arteriole segment under conditions of steady laminar flow, the volumetric flow rate $Q$ is proportional to the fourth power of the arteriole's radius $r$. This relationship is expressed as:\n$$\nQ \\propto r^{4}\n$$\nThis proportionality can be written as an equation by introducing a constant of proportionality, $k$. The constant $k$ encapsulates the fixed parameters of the system, such as the pressure drop $\\Delta P$, the fluid's dynamic viscosity $\\mu$, and the segment length $L$. Specifically, from the full Hagen-Poiseuille equation, $k = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}$. Since these parameters are stated to be constant, $k$ is also a constant. The equation for flow is:\n$$\nQ = k r^{4}\n$$\nLet the baseline (initial) state be denoted by the subscript $0$.

At autopsy, three adjacent segments of ileum are sampled to reflect spatial variability in duration and severity of ischemia and reperfusion. Histologic descriptions are as follows, each integrating the mucosa, submucosa, muscularis propria, and serosa:\n\n- Specimen $X$: Patchy superficial epithelial necrosis and sloughing along villus tips with preserved crypt architecture, intact muscularis propria, capillary congestion, and focal hemorrhage within the lamina propria. No fibrinous hyalinization of the lamina propria is identified and the submucosa lacks marked edema.\n- Specimen $Y$: Mucosa shows attenuated, “withered” crypts with decreased cellularity and nuclear pyknosis, crypt dropout, and lamina propria that appears homogeneously eosinophilic due to plasma protein and fibrin deposition (“hyalinized lamina propria”). Muscularis propria remains viable with preserved myocyte nuclei. The submucosa demonstrates edema and congestion.\n- Specimen $Z$: Transmural coagulative necrosis extends from mucosa through muscularis propria to serosa, with loss of myocyte nuclei, ghost-like outlines of smooth muscle bundles, mural hemorrhage, and fibrin thrombi in submucosal vessels. The serosa shows fibrinous exudate.\n\nUsing the following principle-based categories of expected progression with increasing duration and depth of ischemia—early superficial mucosal injury; intermediate injury extending to stem-cell–rich crypts with lamina propria hyalinization; and late full-thickness infarction—choose the option that correctly assigns each specimen to the most likely time window since the onset of ischemia: $<6$ hours, $6\\text{–}48$ hours, and $>48$ hours.\n\nA. $X:\\,<6$ hours; $Y:\\,6\\text{–}48$ hours; $Z:\\,>48$ hours\n\nB. $X:\\,6\\text{–}48$ hours; $Y:\\,<6$ hours; $Z:\\,>48$ hours\n\nC. $X:\\,>48$ hours; $Y:\\,6\\text{–}48$ hours; $Z:\\,<6$ hours\n\nD. $X:\\,<6$ hours; $Y:\\,>48$ hours; $Z:\\,6\\text{–}48$ hours", "solution": "Begin from foundational pathophysiology of ischemic injury in the bowel:\n\n- Intestinal mucosal epithelium, particularly villus tips and surface epithelium, has high metabolic demand and limited reserve due to the microvascular architecture featuring countercurrent exchange; this renders superficial mucosa most vulnerable to early hypoxic injury. The earliest changes with acute hypoperfusion include epithelial sloughing, superficial necrosis, and lamina propria capillary congestion within approximately $<6$ hours.\n- With sustained ischemia beyond the initial phase, injury progresses to stem-cell–rich crypts. Stem cells are sensitive to ATP depletion; crypts “wither” (become attenuated with nuclear pyknosis), and plasma proteins and fibrin leak into the lamina propria, producing a homogeneously eosinophilic (“hyalinized”) appearance. These features typically develop over approximately $6\\text{–}48$ hours, reflecting progression and potential reperfusion-associated plasma protein extravasation.\n- With prolonged, severe ischemia, irreversible injury extends through the full thickness of the bowel wall, producing transmural coagulative necrosis. Smooth muscle in the muscularis propria loses nuclei and retains ghost outlines; the serosa may show fibrinous exudates; submucosal vessels contain fibrin thrombi. This stage is consistent with prolonged occlusion on the order of $>48$ hours, acknowledging that exact timing depends on severity, collateral flow, and reperfusion, but the pattern indicates late-stage infarction.\n\nApply these well-tested facts to the described specimens:\n\n- Specimen $X$ shows patchy superficial epithelial necrosis and sloughing at villus tips, preserved crypts, and intact muscularis propria without lamina propria hyalinization. This is characteristic of early mucosal injury and best fits $<6$ hours.\n- Specimen $Y$ shows “withered” crypts and a hyalinized lamina propria with preserved muscularis propria. This pattern fits the intermediate phase of injury and is consistent with $6\\text{–}48$ hours.\n- Specimen $Z$ shows transmural coagulative necrosis, including muscularis propria and serosal fibrin.

This matches the derived mapping from fundamental progression of ischemic injury. Verdict — Correct.\n- Option B assigns $X:\\,6\\text{–}48$ hours; $Y:\\,<6$ hours; $Z:\\,>48$ hours. This inverts the early and intermediate phases: $X$ lacks crypt dropout and lamina propria hyalinization, which are defining features of the $6\\text{–}48$-hour window; $Y$ shows those features and cannot be $<6$ hours. Verdict — Incorrect.\n- Option C assigns $X:\\,>48$ hours; $Y:\\,6\\text{–}48$ hours; $Z:\\,<6$ hours. This places the transmural coagulative necrosis of $Z$ in the earliest window, which is incompatible with the need for prolonged ischemia to injure muscularis propria and serosa; furthermore, $X$ lacks full-thickness features required for $>48$ hours. Verdict — Incorrect.\n- Option D assigns $X:\\,<6$ hours; $Y:\\,>48$ hours; $Z:\\,6\\text{–}48$ hours. This reverses the intermediate and late assignments: $Y$ has preserved muscularis propria and no transmural necrosis, inconsistent with $>48$ hours; $Z$ has full-thickness coagulative necrosis, inconsistent with $6\\text{–}48$ hours.
