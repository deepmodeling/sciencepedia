Acid exposure time is defined as the fraction of the total recorded time during which the esophageal hydrogen ion concentration results in a pH reading strictly less than $4$; time at exactly $4$ is not counted as acid exposure. Widely accepted reference ranges for the total acid exposure time fraction are: normal if less than $0.04$, inconclusive if between $0.04$ and $0.06$, and pathological if greater than $0.06$. The recording provides the following sequence of time-stamped esophageal pH values, from start at $t=0$ hours to the end of monitoring at $t=24$ hours.
