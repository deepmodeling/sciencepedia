It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and provides a self-contained and consistent set of data for a standard calculation in clinical pathology. The provided values for pre-test probability and likelihood ratio are realistic for the clinical scenario described.\n\nThe task is to calculate the post-test probability of celiac disease given a pre-test probability and the positive likelihood ratio for the diagnostic test performed. This calculation is a direct application of Bayes' theorem, which can be conveniently expressed in terms of odds and likelihood ratios.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the individual has celiac disease, and let $T$ be the event that the tissue transglutaminase Immunoglobulin A (tTG-IgA) test is positive.\n\nThe givens are:\n1.  The pre-test probability of disease, $P(D) = 0.10$. This is the probability of an individual having the disease before the test result is known.\n2.  The positive likelihood ratio, $LR+ = 19$. The $LR+$ is defined as the ratio of the probability of a positive test result in a person with the disease to the probability of a positive test result in a person without the disease. Formally, $LR+ = \\frac{P(T|D)}{P(T|\\neg D)}$, where $\\neg D$ represents the absence of disease.\n\nThe goal is to compute the post-test probability of disease, which is the conditional probability of having the disease given a positive test result, denoted as $P(D|T)$.\n\nThe relationship between probability ($P$) and odds ($O$) is given by the following formulas:\n$$O = \\frac{P}{1 - P}$$\n$$P = \\frac{O}{1 + O}$$\n\nThe calculation proceeds in three steps:\n1.  Convert the pre-test probability to pre-test odds.\n2.  Update the pre-test odds to post-test odds using the likelihood ratio.\n3.  Convert the post-test odds back to post-test probability.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Pre-Test Odds ($O_{pre}$)**\nThe pre-test probability is given as $P(D) = 0.10$. The corresponding pre-test odds are:\n$$O_{pre} = \\frac{P(D)}{1 - P(D)} = \\frac{0.10}{1 - 0.10} = \\frac{0.10}{0.90} = \\frac{1}{9}$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Post-Test Odds ($O_{post}$)**\nBayes' theorem in its odds form states that the post-test odds are the product of the pre-test odds and the likelihood ratio. For a positive test result, we use the positive likelihood ratio ($LR+$):\n$$O_{post} = O_{pre} \\times LR+$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$O_{post} = \\frac{1}{9} \\times 19 = \\frac{19}{9}$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Post-Test Probability ($P_{post}$)**\nFinally, we convert the post-test odds back to a probability.

To counter this sampling error, clinical guidelines recommend obtaining multiple biopsy specimens. This exercise uses basic probability theory to provide a quantitative justification for this practice, demonstrating how taking multiple independent samples dramatically increases the probability of detecting the disease and securing a correct diagnosis.

To mitigate sampling error, gastroenterologists often take multiple biopsy fragments from different folds of the distal duodenum. Suppose the probability that any single distal duodenal biopsy shows diagnostic changes consistent with celiac disease is $0.7$. Four biopsy fragments are taken from distinct sites, and the biological and procedural setup ensures the outcomes across fragments are independent. Using only the axioms of probability, the definition of independent events, and the complement rule, derive from first principles the expression for the probability that at least one of the four biopsies shows diagnostic changes, then evaluate it exactly for the given parameters. Express your final answer as a decimal and round to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- The context is celiac disease diagnosis via small intestine biopsy.\n- The probability that any single distal duodenal biopsy shows diagnostic changes is $p=0.7$.\n- The number of biopsy fragments taken is $n=4$.\n- The fragments are taken from distinct sites.\n- The outcomes across fragments are independent events.\n- The task is to derive an expression for the probability that at least one of the four biopsies shows diagnostic changes.\n- The derivation must use only: the axioms of probability, the definition of independent events, and the complement rule.\n- The task is to evaluate this expression exactly for the given parameters and provide the final answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed for validity against the established criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is grounded in established medical practice concerning the diagnosis of celiac disease. The concept of patchy mucosal injury and the resulting sampling error is a well-documented clinical challenge. The use of multiple biopsies is standard procedure to increase diagnostic yield. The specified probability of $0.7$ is a plausible, though specific, value for such a scenario. The problem is scientifically and medically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is mathematically well-posed. It provides all necessary parameters ($p=0.7$, $n=4$) and conditions (independence) to calculate a unique probability. The instructions for the derivation are specific and unambiguous.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal, precise, and devoid of subjectivity or bias.\n\nBased on this analysis, the problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no internal contradictions or missing information.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nLet $A_i$ be the event that the $i$-th biopsy fragment shows diagnostic changes, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The problem provides the probability of this event as $P(A_i) = p = 0.7$.\n\nWe are asked to find the probability of the event $E$, defined as \"at least one of the four biopsies shows diagnostic changes\". This event can be expressed as the union of the individual events:\n$$E = A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3 \\cup A_4 = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{4} A_i$$\n\nThe problem explicitly requires using the complement rule for the derivation. The complement of event $E$, denoted $E^c$, is the event that \"no biopsy shows diagnostic changes\" or, equivalently, \"all four biopsies fail to show diagnostic changes\". This corresponds to the intersection of the complements of the individual events $A_i$. Let $A_i^c$ denote the complement of $A_i$, which is the event that the $i$-th biopsy does *not* show diagnostic changes. Then,\n$$E^c = A_1^c \\cap A_2^c \\cap A_3^c \\cap A_4^c = \\bigcap_{i=1}^{4} A_i^c$$\n\nAccording to the axioms of probability, the probability of a complement event is given by $P(A_i^c) = 1 - P(A_i)$. Using the provided value:\n$$P(A_i^c) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3$$\n\nThe problem states that the events $A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4$ are independent. A fundamental consequence of the definition of independence is that if a set of events is mutually independent, then the set of their complements is also mutually independent. Thus, the events $A_1^c, A_2^c, A_3^c, A_4^c$ are independent.\n\nThe definition of independent events states that the probability of their intersection is the product of their individual probabilities. Therefore, we can calculate the probability of $E^c$:\n$$P(E^c) = P\\left(\\bigcap_{i=1}^{4} A_i^c\\right) = \\prod_{i=1}^{4} P(A_i^c)$$\nSince $P(A_i^c) = 1 - p = 0.3$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, this becomes:\n$$P(E^c) = (1-p) \\times (1-p) \\times (1-p) \\times (1-p) = (1-p)^4$$\n\nNow, we apply the complement rule, which states $P(E) = 1 - P(E^c)$. Substituting the expression for $P(E^c)$:\n$$P(E) = 1 - (1-p)^4$$\nThis is the general expression derived from first principles as required.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression for the given parameters, $p=0.7$ and $n=4$.\n$$P(E) = 1 - (1 - 0.7)^4$$\n$$P(E) = 1 - (0.3)^4$$\nFirst, we calculate $(0.3)^4$:\n$$(0.3)^4 = 0.3 \\times 0.3 \\times 0.3 \\times 0.3 = 0.0081$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $P(E)$:\n$$P(E) = 1 - 0.0081 = 0.9919$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be a decimal rounded to four significant figures. The result $0.9919$ has exactly four significant figures ($9, 9, 1, 9$).

The clinical presentation is classic for a malabsorptive syndrome. The description of celiac disease pathophysiology, the role of IgA deficiency, the utility of celiac serology, the characteristics of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing (high NPV, low PPV), and the existence of mimics like giardiasis and drug-induced enteropathy are all factually correct and represent standard knowledge in gastroenterology and pathology.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear objective: to construct an optimal diagnostic sequence. It provides a discrete set of tools and a set of explicit rules (\"fundamental bases\") that constrain the solution. The criteria for optimality (efficiency, minimizing false negatives, early rule-out of mimics, appropriate use of HLA typing) are clearly defined. A logical and unique optimal sequence can be derived from these premises.\n*   **Objective:** The language is clinical, precise, and free of subjectivity or bias. The \"fundamental bases\" are presented as objective principles for guiding the diagnostic process.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formally structured, complete, and asks a verifiable question based on logical deduction from established principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Optimal Sequence\n\nThe task requires constructing the most rational and efficient sequence based on the five provided principles. Let us synthesize the sequence step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Rule out common, easily identifiable mimics first.** Principle 5 states that parasitic infections and drug-induced enteropathy are common mimics that can be identified by \"inexpensive history and stool O&P\". To \"rule out treatable mimics early,\" the logical first steps are to take a comprehensive **drug history** and collect a **stool O&P** sample. This is highly efficient as it addresses reversible or easily treatable causes before proceeding to more complex autoimmune testing.\n\n2.  **Ensure validity of serologic testing.** Principle 2 warns that IgA deficiency causes false-negative IgA-based serology. Principle 3 reinforces this, stating that the interpretation of an IgA-based test depends on total IgA. Therefore, to \"minimize false-negative serology,\" one must measure **total IgA** either before or concurrently with any IgA-based celiac serology. Ordering serology first and only checking total IgA if the serology is negative is inefficient and risks missing the diagnosis in an IgA-deficient patient.\n\n3.  **Perform specific serology.** Once the IgA status is known or being concurrently checked, one can proceed with **celiac serology**. Principle 1 identifies anti–tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) as a key autoantibody. The serologic strategy must be \"tailored to IgA status\": if total IgA is adequate, an IgA-based test like anti-tTG IgA is appropriate. If the patient is IgA deficient, an IgG-based assay (e.g., anti-tTG IgG or anti-deamidated gliadin peptide [DGP] IgG) must be used.\n\n4.  **Reserve HLA typing for specific indications.** Principle 4 highlights that HLA-DQ2/DQ8 are common in the general population ($30$–$40\\%$), giving the test a low positive predictive value. Its strength is its high negative predictive value ($\\approx 99\\%$). Therefore, it is not a good screening test. Its role is to \"exclude celiac disease when noninvasive tests are discordant.\" This means **HLA typing should be reserved** for situations such as negative serology in a patient with high clinical suspicion and compatible histology, or other complex, discordant clinical scenarios.\n\n**Synthesized Optimal Sequence:**\n1.  Drug history and Stool O&P.\n2.  Total IgA measurement.\n3.  Celiac serology, with the specific test choice (IgA vs. IgG) dependent on the total IgA level.\n4.  HLA typing, reserved for resolving diagnostic uncertainty or discordance.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow, we evaluate each option against this logically derived sequence.\n\n**A. Celiac serology (anti–tissue transglutaminase IgA) first; if negative, then total IgA; proceed to HLA typing; only after HLA typing send stool O&P; drug history last.**\n*   This sequence violates Principle 3 by ordering IgA-based serology before confirming adequate total IgA, creating a risk of a false negative.\n*   It violates the efficiency principle of ruling out mimics early (Principle 5) by placing drug history and stool O&P at the end of the sequence.\n*   It uses HLA typing inappropriately as a routine follow-up to a negative serology without considering the reason for the negative result (e.g., IgA deficiency).\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. Drug history first; then total IgA; then celiac serology tailored to IgA status (anti–tissue transglutaminase IgA if total IgA is adequate or Immunoglobulin G-based assays if IgA deficient); then stool O&P; reserve HLA typing for serology-histology or clinical discordance.**\n*   This sequence begins by ruling out common mimics with a drug history (Principle 5).\n*   It correctly measures total IgA to inform the choice of serology, adhering to Principles 2 and 3 and minimizing the risk of false negatives.\n*   It explicitly mentions tailoring the serology to IgA status, which is the correct application.\n*   It includes stool O&P early in the workup, consistent with Principle 5. The placement after initial serology is still clinically reasonable, though placing it first is also logical. The key is that it is done before invasive or highly specialized tests.\n*   It correctly reserves HLA typing for resolving discordance, matching the high-NPV, low-PPV profile described in Principle 4.\n*   This sequence aligns perfectly with the derived optimal pathway.\n*   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. HLA typing first; if HLA DQ2/DQ8 present, proceed to celiac serology without measuring total IgA; only if serology negative, check stool O&P; drug history last.**\n*   This sequence incorrectly uses HLA typing as a first-line screening test, which is inefficient due to its low positive predictive value (Principle 4). A positive result occurs in a large fraction of the healthy population.\n*   It fails to measure total IgA, violating Principles 2 and 3 and risking a false-negative serology.\n*   It delays the investigation of common mimics until late in the process, violating the efficiency guideline in Principle 5.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Stool O&P first; then HLA typing; then celiac serology (IgA-based only) without measuring total IgA; drug history optional.**\n*   This sequence incorrectly uses HLA typing as an early screening tool (violates Principle 4).\n*   It again fails to measure total IgA, ignoring the risk of false negatives from IgA deficiency (violates Principles 2 and 3).\n*   It makes the drug history optional, which is an error as drug-induced enteropathy is a key mimic to exclude (Principle 5).\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Total IgA last after completing celiac serology; begin with stool O&P; then drug history; finally HLA typing irrespective of prior results.**\n*   This sequence correctly starts with ruling out mimics (Principle 5).\n*   However, it measures total IgA *after* celiac serology, which completely defeats the purpose of checking for IgA deficiency (violates Principle 3). This is a critical flaw.\n*   It advocates for HLA typing \"irrespective of prior results,\" which is a misuse of the test given its specific role in resolving discordance (violates Principle 4).\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4337260"}]}
