This is in stark contrast to the intestinal-type, which is defined by the formation of cohesive, gland-like structures. The endoscopic finding of a \"diffusely thickened gastric wall\" (a finding known as linitis plastica) is the macroscopic correlate of this infiltrative growth pattern.\n\n2.  **Molecular Pathogenesis:** The fundamental defect in diffuse-type gastric cancer is the loss of intercellular adhesion. The primary protein responsible for holding epithelial cells together in adherens junctions is **E-cadherin**, which is encoded by the cadherin 1 gene (*CDH1*). The discohesive nature of the tumor cells strongly implies a functional loss of E-cadherin. This loss is most commonly caused by inactivating mutations or epigenetic silencing of the *CDH1* gene.\n\n3.  **Immunohistochemical Profile:**\n    *   **E-cadherin:** A direct consequence of *CDH1* inactivation is the loss of E-cadherin protein expression at the cell membrane. IHC staining in this case would be expected to show loss of the normal, crisp membranous staining pattern seen in healthy epithelial cells.\n    *   **p120-catenin:** This protein binds to the cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin. When E-cadherin is lost from the membrane, p120-catenin is released and relocates to the cytoplasm. Therefore, cytoplasmic (as opposed to membranous) staining for p120-catenin is a common ancillary finding that supports E-cadherin dysfunction.\n\n4.  **Evaluation of Options:**\n    *   **A:** This option correctly identifies the tumor as diffuse-type, links it to *CDH1* gene inactivation, and accurately predicts the IHC profile of E-cadherin loss and p120-catenin cytoplasmic relocalization. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **B:** This describes an intestinal-type adenocarcinoma, which is inconsistent with the signet-ring cell histology. Intestinal-type cancers are cohesive and would show retained membranous E-cadherin staining.\n    *   **C:** This describes a benign hyperplastic polyp, which is incorrect as the biopsy shows invasive carcinoma.\n    *   **D:** Microsatellite Instability (MSI)-high tumors are typically intestinal-type, are characterized by a dense lymphocytic infiltrate (not mentioned), and, crucially, they are cohesive and show preserved membranous E-cadherin staining.\n    *   **E:** HER2-amplified gastric cancer is also typically of the cohesive, intestinal-type and would not present with a diffuse, signet-ring cell histology. It relies on intact cell junctions.\n\nTherefore, the combination of diffuse-type histology, driven by *CDH1* alterations leading to E-cadherin loss, provides the most accurate and comprehensive interpretation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4373091"}, {"introduction": "Accurate staging is paramount in oncology, as it dictates the therapeutic strategy.

The terminology used, such as Paris classification (0-IIc), nonlifting sign, submucosal invasion, well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, and the treatment modalities (ESD, EMR, gastrectomy), are standard in the field.

It presents a standard decision-making challenge in clinical oncology. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe management of early gastric cancer (EGC) is determined by the risk of lymph node metastasis. Endoscopic resection techniques like Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) are considered curative only when this risk is negligible. The decision hinges on a careful assessment of several features of the primary tumor: size, macroscopic type (Paris classification), histology, presence of ulceration, and, most critically, the depth of invasion.\n\nThe patient has a $1.2$ cm, Paris classification 0-IIc (depressed type), well-differentiated adenocarcinoma without ulceration. While some of these features (size $ 2$ cm, no ulceration, well-differentiated histology) might suggest eligibility for ESD under expanded criteria, the single most important piece of information provided is the **nonlifting sign**.\n\nThe pathological architecture of the gastric wall consists of sequential layers: mucosa, submucosa, muscularis propria, and serosa. During an endoscopic resection, a saline solution is injected into the submucosal layer to lift the mucosa (and the lesion contained within it) away from the deeper muscularis propria. This creates a safety cushion and a clear plane for dissection.\n\nThe \"nonlifting sign\" is the failure of the lesion to elevate upon submucosal injection. This clinical sign has a well-established pathological correlate: fibrosis within the submucosal layer, which tethers the overlying mucosa to the muscularis propria. Such fibrosis is most commonly caused by significant invasion of the tumor into the submucosa, particularly deep submucosal invasion (defined as invasion $> 500$ µm from the muscularis mucosae, often denoted as $SM_2$ or deeper).\n\nThe depth of submucosal invasion is the strongest predictor of lymph node metastasis in EGC. While lesions confined to the mucosa or with only minute submucosal invasion ($SM_1$, $\\le 500$ µm) have a very low risk of lymph node metastasis ($ 3\\%$), the risk escalates dramatically with deep submucosal ($SM_2$) invasion, reaching rates of $15-25\\%$ or higher. Such a high probability of metastatic disease in regional lymph nodes cannot be addressed by an endoscopic-only approach.\n\nTherefore, the nonlifting sign is considered a strong, often absolute, contraindication for curative-intent endoscopic resection. It indicates that the cancer has likely advanced to a stage where surgical intervention is necessary to provide both local control and treatment of the regional lymph nodes. The biopsy result, showing no *definitive* lymphovascular invasion, is insufficient to override the powerful negative predictive value of the nonlifting sign; a small forceps biopsy samples only a tiny fraction of the tumor and the underlying stroma and cannot reliably assess the full depth of invasion.\n\nThe appropriate management is, therefore, a treatment that addresses both the primary tumor and the high risk of regional nodal disease. This treatment is surgical gastrectomy (subtotal or total, depending on location) combined with a formal regional lymph node dissection (e.g., D1+ or D2 lymphadenectomy).\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Proceed with Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) because the lesion size is $\\le 2$ cm and there is no ulceration on endoscopy.**\nThis option correctly notes some factors that favor ESD but completely ignores the overriding negative factor: the nonlifting sign. The presence of a nonlifting sign strongly suggests that the criteria for a curative endoscopic resection (i.e., negligible risk of lymph node metastasis) are not met. Furthermore, it predicts significant technical difficulty and an increased risk of perforation during the ESD procedure itself.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. Recommend surgical gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection because the nonlifting sign implies likely submucosal invasion beyond a minute depth, making endoscopic therapy non-curative.**\nThis statement accurately synthesizes the clinical data. It correctly identifies the nonlifting sign as the key finding, correctly interprets its implication (deep submucosal invasion), and correctly concludes that this finding points to a high risk of lymph node metastasis, rendering endoscopic therapy non-curative. Therefore, it correctly recommends the standard-of-care for such a scenario: surgical resection with lymphadenectomy.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. Attempt Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) because the small size and depressed configuration favor snare capture.**\nThis is incorrect for multiple reasons. First, as with option A, it ignores the nonlifting sign, which contraindicates any attempt at curative endoscopic resection. Second, for a confirmed adenocarcinoma that is $1.2$ cm and depressed, ESD is generally preferred over EMR to ensure *en bloc* resection for accurate histopathological staging. A depressed configuration does not necessarily favor snare capture with EMR. Third, EMR is even less likely to succeed than ESD in the presence of submucosal fibrosis indicated by the nonlifting sign.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Defer intervention and schedule surveillance endoscopy in $6$ months to reassess for interval change.**\nThis is a grave error in clinical judgment. The patient has a biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma. Delaying treatment for a confirmed malignancy, especially one with signs of aggressive behavior (deep invasion suggested by the nonlifting sign), is contrary to all oncologic principles and constitutes malpractice. The lesion requires immediate and definitive therapy.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Proceed with ESD as a diagnostic resection; if histology shows non-curative features, then refer for surgery afterward, as the small size minimizes risk.**\nWhile diagnostic ESD is a concept, it is not the most appropriate *initial* step in this case. The nonlifting sign is not merely a suggestion of a non-curative outcome; it is a strong predictor of it and also a predictor of procedural failure (inability to complete the resection) and complications (perforation). To subject a patient to the risks of a complex ESD procedure when the pre-procedural evidence already points strongly toward the need for surgery is poor risk-benefit management. The most direct, safe, and oncologically sound approach is to proceed directly to surgery. The small size does not negate the high risk of nodal metastasis or the procedural risks of ESD on a non-lifting lesion.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4373085"}, {"introduction": "The role of the modern pathologist is increasingly centered on providing predictive information to guide personalized medicine.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the Combined Positive Score (CPS) and its evaluation against two clinical thresholds. The foundational definition of CPS in the context of gastric carcinoma immunohistochemistry is the number of all PD-L1 positive cells (which includes tumor cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages) divided by the total number of viable tumor cells, with the resulting ratio multiplied by $100$.\n\nLet us define the variables based on the provided data:\n-   Let $N_{TC+}$ be the number of PD-L1 positive tumor cells.\n-   Let $N_{IC+}$ be the number of PD-L1 positive immune cells (lymphocytes and macrophages).\n-   Let $N_{TC,total}$ be the total number of viable tumor cells.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n-   $N_{TC+} = 120$\n-   $N_{IC+} = 80$\n-   $N_{TC,total} = 1000$\n\nThe formula for the Combined Positive Score (CPS) is:\n$$ \\text{CPS} = \\frac{N_{TC+} + N_{IC+}}{N_{TC,total}} \\times 100 $$\n\nThe numerator represents the total number of PD-L1 staining cells. The denominator is the total population of viable tumor cells, which serves as the normalization factor.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$ \\text{CPS} = \\frac{120 + 80}{1000} \\times 100 $$\n\nFirst, we sum the number of all PD-L1 positive cells:\n$$ N_{TC+} + N_{IC+} = 120 + 80 = 200 $$\n\nNext, we substitute this sum back into the CPS formula:\n$$ \\text{CPS} = \\frac{200}{1000} \\times 100 $$\n\nPerforming the division:\n$$ \\frac{200}{1000} = 0.2 $$\n\nFinally, we multiply by $100$ to obtain the score as a plain number, as is standard practice:\n$$ \\text{CPS} = 0.2 \\times 100 = 20 $$\n\nThe calculated CPS is $20$.\n\nNow, we must evaluate this result against the two specified clinical thresholds to determine eligibility.

Therefore, the eligibility indicator for the CPS $\\geq 10$ threshold is $1$.\n\nThe final answer requires a row matrix containing three entries in order: the CPS value, the eligibility indicator for the first threshold, and the eligibility indicator for the second threshold.
