Mendelian inheritance with codominant expression at the SERPINA1 locus: in meiosis, each parent transmits one allele to a gamete with equal probability, consistent with the law of segregation. Gamete fusion is independent and equally likely across the possible gamete combinations, consistent with the law of independent assortment.\n\n2. Well-tested genotype–phenotype relationships for secreted serum A1AT levels due to allele-specific folding and secretion efficiencies: Z-allele A1AT is misfolded, polymerizes, and is retained in hepatocytes, leading to a substantial reduction in serum A1AT; in PiZZ individuals the steady-state serum level is approximately a fixed fraction of the PiMM baseline.\n\nAssume the following for quantitative estimation: a clinical laboratory reports the mean steady-state A1AT concentration in a healthy PiMM adult as $L_{0} = 1.5$ g/L.
