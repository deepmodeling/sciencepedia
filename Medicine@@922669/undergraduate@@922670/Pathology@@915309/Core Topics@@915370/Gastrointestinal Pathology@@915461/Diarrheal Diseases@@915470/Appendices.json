By calculating the osmotic gap from given stool electrolyte data, you will develop a foundational skill in applying physiological principles to clinical diagnosis.", "problem": "A previously healthy adult presents with abrupt onset of profuse, watery diarrhea after travel to a coastal region where Vibrio cholerae is endemic. On day $1$ of illness, a stool electrolyte panel is obtained from a fresh, non-fermented sample of diarrheal fluid, with the following measured concentrations: sodium $([\\text{Na}^{+}]) = 110\\,\\text{mmol/L}$, potassium $([\\text{K}^{+}]) = 25\\,\\text{mmol/L}$, chloride $([\\text{Cl}^{-}]) = 95\\,\\text{mmol/L}$, and bicarbonate $([\\text{HCO}_{3}^{-}]) = 40\\,\\text{mmol/L}$.

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of gastrointestinal physiology, well-posed with sufficient data for a unique solution, and objectively stated.\n\nThe task is to calculate the stool osmotic gap for a patient with profuse, watery diarrhea and to interpret the result in the context of suspected cholera. The stool osmotic gap is defined as the difference between the total osmolality of the stool fluid and the osmolality contributed by the measured major inorganic electrolytes.\n\nFirst, we must establish the total osmolality of the stool fluid. The problem states a foundational physiological principle: a healthy and intact intestinal epithelium is highly permeable to water. As a result, water moves rapidly across the epithelium to eliminate any osmotic gradient between the luminal contents and the blood plasma. Therefore, in diarrheal states, the osmolality of the watery stool is expected to be approximately equal to the osmolality of the plasma.\nThe patient's measured serum osmolality is given as $290\\,\\text{mOsm/kg}$. Thus, we can approximate the total stool osmolality as:\n$$\n\\text{Total Stool Osmolality} \\approx \\text{Serum Osmolality} = 290\\,\\text{mOsm/kg}\n$$\n\nNext, we must calculate the portion of the stool osmolality accounted for by the measured electrolytes. The osmotically active electrolytes in stool are primarily sodium ($[\\text{Na}^{+}]$), potassium ($[\\text{K}^{+}]$), chloride ($[\\text{Cl}^{-}]$), and bicarbonate ($[\\text{HCO}_{3}^{-}]$). The standard clinical approximation for the osmolality contributed by these electrolytes is to double the sum of the major cation concentrations. This factor of $2$ accounts for the anions that must be present to maintain electroneutrality in the solution.\nThe formula for the calculated stool osmolality is:\n$$\n\\text{Calculated Stool Osmolality} = 2 \\times ([\\text{Na}^{+}]_{\\text{stool}} + [\\text{K}^{+}]_{\\text{stool}})\n$$\nUsing the electrolyte concentrations provided from the patient's stool sample:\n$[\\text{Na}^{+}] = 110\\,\\text{mmol/L}$\n$[\\text{K}^{+}] = 25\\,\\text{mmol/L}$\n\nLet us substitute these values into the formula. Since the diarrheal fluid is watery, its density is approximately $1\\,\\text{kg/L}$, and therefore concentrations in $\\text{mmol/L}$ (molarity) can be validly approximated as $\\text{mOsm/kg}$ (osmolality) for this calculation.\n$$\n\\text{Calculated Stool Osmolality} = 2 \\times (110\\,\\text{mmol/L} + 25\\,\\text{mmol/L}) = 2 \\times (135\\,\\text{mmol/L}) = 270\\,\\text{mOsm/kg}\n$$\nNotably, the provided anion concentrations, $[\\text{Cl}^{-}] = 95\\,\\text{mmol/L}$ and $[\\text{HCO}_{3}^{-}] = 40\\,\\text{mmol/L}$, sum to $135\\,\\text{mmol/L}$, which perfectly balances the given cation concentrations. Therefore, calculating the osmolality as the simple sum of all measured ions, $[\\text{Na}^{+}] + [\\text{K}^{+}] + [\\text{Cl}^{-}] + [\\text{HCO}_{3}^{-}]$, would yield the same result: $110 + 25 + 95 + 40 = 270\\,\\text{mOsm/kg}$. This confirms the consistency of the data and the validity of the standard formula in this context.\n\nNow we can derive the expression for the stool osmotic gap and calculate its value.\n$$\n\\text{Stool Osmotic Gap} = \\text{Total Stool Osmolality} - \\text{Calculated Stool Osmolality}\n$$\nSubstituting the values we have determined:\n$$\n\\text{Stool Osmotic Gap} = 290\\,\\text{mOsm/kg} - 270\\,\\text{mOsm/kg} = 20\\,\\text{mOsm/kg}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures, which gives $20.0\\,\\text{mOsm/kg}$.\n\nFinally, we must assess whether this calculated gap is physiologically consistent with secretory diarrhea due to cholera. The stool osmotic gap represents the contribution of unmeasured, osmotically active solutes to the total stool osmolality.\nIn **secretory diarrhea**, such as that caused by *Vibrio cholerae*, the primary pathogenic mechanism is the active secretion of electrolytes (primarily $\\text{Cl}^{-}$, followed by $\\text{Na}^{+}$, $\\text{K}^{+}$, and $\\text{HCO}_{3}^{-}$) into the intestinal lumen. Water follows this osmotic gradient, leading to profuse watery diarrhea. In this case, the stool's osmolality is almost entirely accounted for by these secreted electrolytes. Consequently, the stool osmotic gap is characteristically small, typically defined as less than $50\\,\\text{mOsm/kg}$.\nIn contrast, **osmotic diarrhea** is caused by the presence of poorly absorbed solutes in the lumen (e.g., lactose in lactose intolerance, or laxatives like magnesium sulfate). These unmeasured osmoles create the osmotic gradient that draws water into the gut. This results in a large stool osmotic gap, typically greater than $100\\,\\text{mOsm/kg}$.\n\nThe calculated stool osmotic gap for this patient is $20.0\\,\\text{mOsm/kg}$. This value is low and falls well within the range expected for a pure secretory diarrhea. This finding is therefore highly consistent with the clinical picture of cholera, where the diarrhea is driven by toxin-mediated electrolyte secretion, not unabsorbed osmotic agents.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{20.0}\n$$", "id": "4355432"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of the stool osmotic gap, we now investigate its application in diagnosing osmotic diarrhea.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe fecal osmotic gap is a calculated value representing the concentration of osmotically active solutes in the fecal water that are not accounted for by the major electrolytes, sodium ($Na^{+}$) and potassium ($K^{+}$). The fundamental principle is that the intestinal contents are typically isotonic with plasma. Thus, the total osmolality of stool water ($O_{\\text{stool, total}}$) is assumed to be equal to the plasma osmolality, which is approximately $290$ mOsm/kg.\n\nThe total osmolality of the stool water is the sum of the osmolality contributed by electrolytes and the osmolality contributed by other unmeasured osmoles (the \"gap\"). The primary electrolytes contributing to osmolality are sodium and potassium salts. Based on the principle of electroneutrality, the concentrations of anions are assumed to balance the concentrations of the major cations ($[\\text{Na}^+]$ and $[\\text{K}^+]$). Therefore, the osmotic contribution from these electrolytes is estimated as twice the sum of their concentrations.\n\nThe formula for the fecal osmotic gap ($OG$) is:\n$$OG = O_{\\text{stool, total}} - 2 \\times ([\\text{Na}^+]_{\\text{stool}} + [\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{stool}})$$\n\nWe are given:\n- Stool sodium concentration, $[\\text{Na}^+]_{\\text{stool}} = 23$ mmol/L\n- Stool potassium concentration, $[\\text{K}^+]_{\\text{stool}} = 29$ mmol/L\n\nWe use the standard physiological value for plasma osmolality:\n- Assumed total stool osmolality, $O_{\\text{stool, total}} = 290$ mOsm/kg\n\nNote that for dilute aqueous solutions like stool water, the units mmol/L are practically equivalent to mOsm/kg.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$OG = 290 - 2 \\times (23 + 29)$$\nFirst, calculate the sum of the cation concentrations:\n$$23 + 29 = 52 \\text{ mmol/L}$$\nNext, calculate the total estimated electrolyte contribution to osmolality:\n$$2 \\times 52 = 104 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$$\nFinally, calculate the osmotic gap:\n$$OG = 290 - 104 = 186 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$$\n\nThe calculated fecal osmotic gap is $186$ mOsm/kg. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The number $186$ already has three significant figures, so no further rounding is needed.\n\nFor completeness, although not required for the final answer, this result can be interpreted. A fecal osmotic gap greater than $125$ mOsm/kg is highly indicative of osmotic diarrhea. The calculated value of $186$ mOsm/kg, combined with the clinical observation that the diarrhea ceases with fasting, strongly supports a diagnosis of osmotic diarrhea. This condition is caused by the ingestion of poorly absorbed, osmotically active substances (e.g., lactose in lactase deficiency, sorbitol, magnesium salts), which draw water into the intestinal lumen, causing diarrhea. This contrasts with secretory diarrhea, which is characterized by a low osmotic gap (typically $< 50$ mOsm/kg) and persistence of symptoms despite fasting. The most plausible pathophysiologic driver is a form of carbohydrate malabsorption, given the postprandial timing of symptoms.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{186}$$", "id": "4355478"}, {"introduction": "After mastering the diagnosis of diarrheal mechanisms, the focus shifts to the cornerstone of treatment: Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT).
