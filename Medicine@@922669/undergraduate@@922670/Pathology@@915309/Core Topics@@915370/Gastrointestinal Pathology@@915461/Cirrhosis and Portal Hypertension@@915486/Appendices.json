No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is first subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Patient condition: Biopsy-proven cirrhosis.\n- Procedure: Transjugular hepatic venous catheterization.\n- Measurement 1: Wedged hepatic venous pressure ($\\text{WHVP}$) = $22$ mmHg.\n- Measurement 2: Free hepatic venous pressure ($\\text{FHVP}$) = $8$ mmHg.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The scenario describes a standard, gold-standard clinical procedure (hepatic venous catheterization) for assessing the severity of portal hypertension in patients with cirrhosis. The variables $\\text{WHVP}$, $\\text{FHVP}$, and the derived hepatic venous pressure gradient ($\\text{HVPG}$) are central concepts in hepatology. The provided pressure values are clinically realistic for a patient with advanced liver disease.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary data ($\\text{WHVP}$ and $\\text{FHVP}$) to calculate the $\\text{HVPG}$ using a universally accepted definition. The interpretation is based on well-established, quantitative clinical thresholds, ensuring a unique and meaningful solution.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem statement is free of subjective language, ambiguity, or bias. It presents factual data and requests a calculation and interpretation based on standard medical principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution is warranted.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the hepatic venous pressure gradient ($\\text{HVPG}$). This gradient is the established surrogate for portal pressure and is defined as the difference between the wedged hepatic venous pressure ($\\text{WHVP}$) and the free hepatic venous pressure ($\\text{FHVP}$). The $\\text{WHVP}$ is an accurate estimate of the pressure in the hepatic sinusoids, which, in the case of cirrhosis (a sinusoidal cause of portal hypertension), reflects the portal venous pressure. The $\\text{FHVP}$ reflects the pressure in the inferior vena cava.\n\nThe formula for the $\\text{HVPG}$ is:\n$$\n\\text{HVPG} = \\text{WHVP} - \\text{FHVP}\n$$\nThe provided values are:\n- $\\text{WHVP} = 22 \\text{ mmHg}$\n- $\\text{FHVP} = 8 \\text{ mmHg}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula yields the $\\text{HVPG}$:\n$$\n\\text{HVPG} = 22 - 8 = 14 \\text{ mmHg}\n$$\nThe calculated hepatic venous pressure gradient is $14 \\text{ mmHg}$.\n\nThe second part of the task is to interpret this result based on established clinico-hemodynamic thresholds in the context of cirrhosis and portal hypertension.\n$1$. A normal $\\text{HVPG}$ is in the range of $1-5 \\text{ mmHg}$. Portal hypertension is hemodynamically defined as an $\\text{HVPG}  5 \\text{ mmHg}$. Since $14 \\text{ mmHg}  5 \\text{ mmHg}$, the patient has portal hypertension.\n\n$2$. **Clinically Significant Portal Hypertension (CSPH)** is defined by an $\\text{HVPG} \\ge 10 \\text{ mmHg}$. This is a critical threshold, as patients exceeding it are at risk for developing major complications of cirrhosis, including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and esophageal varices. The patient's value is $14 \\text{ mmHg}$, which satisfies the condition $14 \\ge 10$. Therefore, the patient has clinically significant portal hypertension.\n\n$3$. **Risk of Variceal Hemorrhage**: The risk of bleeding from gastroesophageal varices increases substantially when the $\\text{HVPG}$ is $\\ge 12 \\text{ mmHg}$. This level of portal pressure is associated with a high wall tension in existing varices, predisposing them to rupture. The patient's value of $14 \\text{ mmHg}$ meets this criterion ($14 \\ge 12$), indicating a significantly increased risk of variceal hemorrhage.\n\nIn conclusion, the calculated $\\text{HVPG}$ of $14 \\text{ mmHg}$ not only confirms the presence of clinically significant portal hypertension but also places the patient in a high-risk category for life-threatening variceal bleeding.

This method averages the marginal effect of changing $R$ over the two possible paths from the initial state $(Q_{0}, R_{0})$ to the final state $(Q_{1}, R_{1})$.\n\n**Path 1: Resistance changes first, then flow.**\n1.  The resistance changes from $R_{0}$ to $R_{1}$ while the flow is held at its initial value, $Q_{0}$. The change in pressure gradient due to this step is the marginal contribution of resistance in this path:\n    $$ C_{R,1} = (Q_{0} \\times R_{1}) - (Q_{0} \\times R_{0}) = Q_{0} \\times (R_{1} - R_{0}) $$\n    $$ C_{R,1} = 1.2 \\times (7.0 - 3.5) = 1.2 \\times 3.5 = 4.2 \\, \\text{mmHg} $$\n\n**Path 2: Flow changes first, then resistance.**\n1.  First, the flow changes from $Q_{0}$ to $Q_{1}$ while resistance is held at $R_{0}$.\n2.  Then, the resistance changes from $R_{0}$ to $R_{1}$ while the flow is held at its final value, $Q_{1}$. The change in pressure gradient during this second step is the marginal contribution of resistance in this path:\n    $$ C_{R,2} = (Q_{1} \\times R_{1}) - (Q_{1} \\times R_{0}) = Q_{1} \\times (R_{1} - R_{0}) $$\n    $$ C_{R,2} = 1.8 \\times (7.0 - 3.5) = 1.8 \\times 3.5 = 6.3 \\, \\text{mmHg} $$\n\nThe contribution of resistance, $C_{R}$, is defined as the average of its marginal effects across these two paths:\n$$ C_{R} = \\frac{C_{R,1} + C_{R,2}}{2} = \\frac{4.2 + 6.3}{2} = \\frac{10.5}{2} = 5.25 \\, \\text{mmHg} $$\nThis can also be expressed symbolically:\n$$ C_{R} = \\frac{Q_{0}(R_{1} - R_{0}) + Q_{1}(R_{1} - R_{0})}{2} = \\left(\\frac{Q_{0} + Q_{1}}{2}\\right) (R_{1} - R_{0}) $$\nUsing the numerical values:\n$$ C_{R} = \\left(\\frac{1.2 + 1.8}{2}\\right) (7.0 - 3.5) = \\left(\\frac{3.0}{2}\\right) (3.5) = 1.5 \\times 3.5 = 5.25 \\, \\text{mmHg} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the fraction of the total increase in portal pressure gradient that is attributable to the increase in resistance:\n$$ f_{R} = \\frac{C_{R}}{\\Delta P_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{5.25}{8.4} $$\nThe calculation yields:\n$$ f_{R} = 0.625 $$\nThe problem requires the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.

Consider a segment of the esophageal varix of length $L$. The internal transmural pressure, $P$, exerts an outward force on the internal walls of the cylinder.\n\nTo find the circumferential or \"hoop\" stress, we make a conceptual longitudinal cut through the cylinder. The force tending to separate the two halves of the cylindrical segment is the pressure $P$ acting on the projected rectangular area, which is the diameter ($2r$) times the length ($L$).\n$$ F_{\\text{pressure}} = P \\times (2r L) $$\nThis separating force is counteracted by the tensile forces within the material of the cylinder wall. The resisting force is the circumferential stress, $\\sigma$, acting over the area of the cut wall. The area of the cut wall consists of two rectangular sections, each with length $L$ and thickness $t$.\n$$ A_{\\text{wall}} = 2 \\times (t L) = 2tL $$\nThe total restraining force is therefore:\n$$ F_{\\text{restraining}} = \\sigma \\times A_{\\text{wall}} = \\sigma \\times (2tL) $$\nFor the varix to be in equilibrium (i.e., not to burst), these forces must balance:\n$$ F_{\\text{pressure}} = F_{\\text{restraining}} $$\n$$ P \\times (2rL) = \\sigma \\times (2tL) $$\nThe length $L$ cancels from both sides, yielding the formula for circumferential stress, which is a specific form of the Law of Laplace for a cylinder:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{Pr}{t} $$\nNext, we must convert all given parameters to SI units (meters, Pascals).\n\nThe transmural pressure $P$ is given by the HVPG:\n$$ P = 19 \\text{ mmHg} $$\nUsing the conversion factor $1 \\text{ mmHg} = 133.322 \\text{ Pa}$:\n$$ P = 19 \\times 133.322 \\text{ Pa} = 2533.118 \\text{ Pa} $$\nThe variceal radius $r$ is:\n$$ r = 3.8 \\text{ mm} = 3.8 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m} $$\nThe variceal wall thickness $t$ is:\n$$ t = 0.25 \\text{ mm} = 0.25 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m} $$\nThe critical stress for rupture $\\sigma_{\\text{crit}}$ is:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{crit}} = 35 \\text{ kPa} = 35 \\times 10^3 \\text{ Pa} $$\nNow, we can calculate the circumferential wall stress $\\sigma$ using the derived formula:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{P r}{t} = \\frac{(2533.118 \\text{ Pa}) \\times (3.8 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m})}{0.25 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m}} $$\nThe factors of $10^{-3}$ in the numerator and denominator cancel:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{2533.118 \\times 3.8}{0.25} \\text{ Pa} $$\n$$ \\sigma = 2533.118 \\times 15.2 \\text{ Pa} $$\n$$ \\sigma = 38503.3936 \\text{ Pa} $$\nThe safety factor $S$ is defined as the ratio of the calculated stress $\\sigma$ to the critical stress $\\sigma_{\\text{crit}}$:\n$$ S = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma_{\\text{crit}}} = \\frac{38503.3936 \\text{ Pa}}{35 \\times 10^3 \\text{ Pa}} $$\n$$ S = \\frac{38503.3936}{35000} \\approx 1.10009696 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ S \\approx 1.100 $$\nThe trailing zero is significant.
