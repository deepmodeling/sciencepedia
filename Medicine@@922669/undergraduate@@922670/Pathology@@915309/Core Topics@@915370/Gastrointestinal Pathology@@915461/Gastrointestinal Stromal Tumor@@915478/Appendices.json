Pathologists use standardized risk stratification systems, like the widely adopted AFIP criteria, which integrate tumor size, mitotic rate, and anatomic location to predict outcomes. This exercise provides hands-on practice in applying this essential algorithm to a clinical case, reinforcing how these key pathological features translate into a formal risk assessment. [@problem_id:4373322]", "problem": "A gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a mesenchymal neoplasm arising from the interstitial cells of Cajal within the gastrointestinal tract; its biological behavior (risk of recurrence or metastasis) is commonly stratified using the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) system, which integrates tumor size, mitotic activity, anatomic site, and rupture status. Consider a primary jejunal GIST with the following parameters: tumor size $s = 6.5$ cm, mitotic index $m = 8$ per 50 High-Power Fields (HPF), and no evidence of tumor rupture ($\\rho = 0$ indicating absence of rupture).\n\nFrom well-established pathology practice, AFIP risk stratification uses the ordered size bands ($0$–$2$ cm), ($2$–$5$ cm), ($5$–$10$ cm), and $>10$ cm, a mitotic index threshold at $m = 5$ per 50 HPF, the anatomic site (gastric versus non-gastric, including jejunal/ileal), and assigns higher risk to any case with rupture. Using these principles, determine the AFIP risk category for this jejunal tumor, and as part of your reasoning, explain how site modifies risk by stating what the category would be if all parameters were identical but the site were gastric (stomach). For the purpose of a numeric final output, encode the AFIP category using the scheme: very low risk $\\rightarrow 1$, low risk $\\rightarrow 2$, intermediate risk $\\rightarrow 3$, high risk $\\rightarrow 4$.\n\nProvide your final answer as the single numeric code corresponding to the jejunal case. No rounding is required. No units are required in the final numeric answer. In your solution, justify your classification starting from the core definitions and widely accepted risk stratification facts in pathology, without using any unvalidated shortcuts.", "solution": "The biological behavior of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) is fundamentally linked to their proliferative capacity and tumor burden, which are assessed histologically and grossly. The mitotic index measured as mitoses per 50 High-Power Fields (HPF) reflects proliferative activity, and tumor size $s$ reflects tumor burden. Numerous clinicopathological studies, such as those synthesized by the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP), have established that the risk of recurrence or metastasis correlates with larger tumor size, higher mitotic index, non-gastric location, and tumor rupture. Rupture significantly increases risk irrespective of other parameters.\n\nWe start from these foundational parameters:\n- Tumor size $s$ stratified into bands: $0$–$2$ cm, $2$–$5$ cm, $5$–$10$ cm, and $>10$ cm.\n- Mitotic index $m$ dichotomized at $m = 5$ mitoses per 50 HPF, with $m \\leq 5$ indicating lower proliferative activity and $m > 5$ indicating higher proliferative activity.\n- Anatomic site: gastric versus non-gastric (e.g., jejunal/ileal). Non-gastric sites have systematically higher risk for the same size and mitotic index compared to gastric sites.\n- Rupture status $\\rho$, where any rupture ($\\rho = 1$) confers high risk.\n\nApply these to the given tumor:\n- Size $s = 6.5$ cm places the tumor in the $5$–$10$ cm size band.\n- Mitotic index $m = 8$ per 50 HPF satisfies $m > 5$.\n- Site is jejunum (non-gastric).\n- Rupture $\\rho = 0$ (no rupture).\n\nUnder AFIP, a non-gastric GIST with $s$ in the $5$–$10$ cm band and $m > 5$ per 50 HPF is classified as high risk. Therefore, the AFIP category for this jejunal case is high risk.\n\nSite-modified risk discussion: AFIP recognizes that non-gastric location (small intestine including jejunum/ileum) carries higher risk than gastric location for the same $s$ and $m$, particularly evident when $m \\leq 5$. For example, if we consider a counterfactual with identical parameters except a lower mitotic index $m \\leq 5$, then for $s = 6.5$ cm, a jejunal tumor would be classified as intermediate risk, whereas a gastric tumor of the same size and low mitotic index would be classified as low risk. In the present case, however, with $m = 8 > 5$, both jejunal and gastric tumors in the $5$–$10$ cm size band are classified as high risk, so the site difference does not change the category in this specific configuration, although the underlying evidence base indicates higher progression propensity in non-gastric sites.\n\nFinally, encode the AFIP category using the specified numeric scheme:\n- very low risk $\\rightarrow 1$\n- low risk $\\rightarrow 2$\n- intermediate risk $\\rightarrow 3$\n- high risk $\\rightarrow 4$\n\nThus, the numeric code for the jejunal case is $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "4373322"}, {"introduction": "Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a cornerstone of GIST diagnosis, but interpreting the results requires careful consideration of the entire marker panel, not just a single stain. GISTs can sometimes show focal expression of markers typically associated with other tumors, such as Smooth Muscle Actin (SMA), creating potential diagnostic pitfalls. This problem challenges you to navigate a complex IHC profile, teaching you to weigh the evidence from specific GIST markers like DOG1 against less specific findings to arrive at an accurate diagnosis. [@problem_id:4373370]", "problem": "A surgical wedge resection of a gastric submucosal mass in a patient aged $55$ years shows a spindle cell neoplasm on H&E sections. The lesion is centered in the muscularis propria and demonstrates intersecting fascicles with variable cellularity and minimal atypia. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) panel reveals the following: Smooth Muscle Actin (SMA) shows cytoplasmic staining in approximately 15% of lesional spindle cells with additional strong staining in the adjacent native muscularis propria; desmin is negative in tumor cells; cluster of differentiation 117 (CD117) is weakly positive in scattered tumor cells; Discovered on GIST-1 (DOG1) shows moderate, diffuse membranous staining in the majority of tumor cells; S100 stains rare cells; cytokeratin AE1/AE3 is negative. Internal positive controls for each stain are adequate.\n\nFundamental base for reasoning includes: \n- Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) arises from or differentiates toward interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), which typically express KIT (CD117) and DOG1; most GISTs are positive for DOG1 (approximately 90-98%) and CD117 (approximately 75-95%), while desmin is typically negative and Smooth Muscle Actin (SMA) may be focally positive (approximately 20-40%), reflecting myogenic differentiation or myofibroblastic features.\n- Smooth muscle neoplasms (leiomyoma/leiomyosarcoma) classically show strong, diffuse SMA and desmin positivity; h-caldesmon is frequently positive in smooth muscle tumors but may also be expressed in GIST, limiting specificity.\n- Immunohistochemistry is subject to pitfalls such as non-specific or background staining, staining of entrapped native tissues (e.g., muscularis propria), antigen retrieval variation, tumor heterogeneity, and sampling bias. Accurate classification requires correlation of morphology, an appropriate panel of markers with known sensitivity and specificity, and attention to stain localization within tumor versus adjacent tissue.\n\nQuestion: Interpreting the focal SMA positivity in this case, which of the following decision algorithms best anticipates the key pitfalls and minimizes diagnostic error when distinguishing GIST from a smooth muscle neoplasm?\n\nA. Call a smooth muscle neoplasm whenever SMA is positive, because SMA positivity identifies smooth muscle lineage; obtain desmin only if SMA is negative, and disregard CD117 or DOG1 given their variability. If desmin is negative, rely on h-caldesmon as a definitive smooth muscle marker to confirm leiomyoma.\n\nB. Begin with morphology and an IHC panel that includes CD117, DOG1, desmin, SMA, and S100. Confirm that SMA staining is present within neoplastic cells rather than adjacent muscularis propria by using serial sections and assessing staining distribution relative to tumor borders. If DOG1 and/or CD117 are positive and desmin is negative, favor GIST even if SMA is focally positive. If CD117 is weak or negative but DOG1 is positive, consider Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha (PDGFRA)-mutant GIST and proceed to KIT/PDGFRA molecular testing. Re-run IHC with alternative antibody clones or protocols if results are discordant, and avoid diagnosing a smooth muscle tumor on focal SMA alone.\n\nC. Use an anatomic-location heuristic: if the lesion is submucosal in the stomach and any SMA positivity is present, classify it as leiomyoma; only consider GIST if CD117 is strongly and diffusely positive. DOG1 is unnecessary because its positivity overlaps with CD117 and does not add value.\n\nD. Because DOG1 can be positive in non-GIST lesions and CD117 is weak in this case, prioritize S100 and cytokeratin panels; if S100 is focally positive, reclassify the tumor as schwannoma or myoepithelial neoplasm regardless of DOG1 and desmin, since focal S100 excludes GIST. If cytokeratin is negative, use SMA positivity to resolve ambiguity in favor of a smooth muscle neoplasm.\n\nSelect the single best option.", "solution": "**Analysis of Case Findings and Rationale for Correct Option**\n\nThe core task is the differential diagnosis of a gastric spindle cell tumor, primarily between a Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) and a smooth muscle neoplasm (e.g., leiomyoma), based on the provided immunohistochemistry (IHC) results.\n\n*   **Key Positive Finding:** The tumor shows moderate, diffuse membranous staining for DOG1. DOG1 is a highly sensitive (over 95%) and specific marker for GIST, making it a powerful piece of evidence.\n*   **Key Negative Finding:** The tumor is negative for desmin. Strong, diffuse desmin positivity is a classic feature of smooth muscle tumors. Its absence argues strongly against a leiomyoma.\n*   **Ambiguous/Potentially Misleading Findings:**\n    *   KIT (CD117) is only weakly positive. While most GISTs are KIT-positive, a subset (especially those with *PDGFRA* mutations) can be KIT-negative or weakly positive. Therefore, weak staining does not exclude GIST, especially when DOG1 is strongly positive.\n    *   Smooth Muscle Actin (SMA) is focally positive (15%). This is a known pitfall, as a significant minority of GISTs (20-40%) can show some degree of SMA expression. Relying on this finding alone would be a mistake.\n    *   S100 and cytokeratin are negative, which helps exclude schwannoma and epithelial tumors, respectively.\n\nBased on this analysis, the constellation of strong DOG1 positivity with desmin negativity is characteristic of GIST, and the focal SMA positivity is a recognized, non-exclusive feature.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\n*   **Option A is incorrect.** It wrongly prioritizes focal SMA positivity and advocates disregarding the most specific GIST markers (DOG1 and KIT).\n*   **Option B is correct.** It represents the standard-of-care diagnostic algorithm. It advocates for a comprehensive panel, correctly addresses the pitfall of entrapped native tissue staining for SMA, establishes the correct hierarchy of markers (prioritizing DOG1/KIT positivity and desmin negativity over focal SMA), and correctly associates the KIT-weak/DOG1-positive phenotype with potential *PDGFRA*-mutant GISTs, suggesting appropriate molecular follow-up. This is a robust, evidence-based approach.\n*   **Option C is incorrect.** It uses a flawed location-based heuristic and dismisses the value of DOG1, which is a critical marker, especially in KIT-negative or weakly positive cases.\n*   **Option D is incorrect.** It follows a convoluted and incorrect line of reasoning, inappropriately prioritizing S100 and misinterpreting the significance of focal staining for both S100 and SMA.\n\nTherefore, algorithm B provides the most scientifically sound and reliable method for reaching the correct diagnosis of GIST in this challenging case.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4373370"}, {"introduction": "The landscape of GIST diagnostics extends into the molecular realm, especially for challenging cases like KIT-negative tumors.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) reveals strong membranous and cytoplasmic staining for Discovered on Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor 1 (DOG1) and no detectable KIT (CD117) expression in tumor cells ($0\\%$ of tumor cells stained). The clinical team requests a definitive classification and a validation strategy to determine whether this represents a Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha (PDGFRA)-mutant Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) as opposed to a Succinate Dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient GIST or a non-GIST mimicker.\n\nConstruct a scientifically sound validation framework that integrates Succinate Dehydrogenase Subunit B (SDHB) IHC and mutational profiling to correctly categorize this KIT-negative, DOG1-positive, epithelioid gastric tumor as PDGFRA-mutant GIST. Your choice must satisfy the following reasoning constraints:\n\n- Begin from first principles in pathology: the Central Dogma (DNA sequence specifies RNA and protein), the principle that specific oncogenic driver mutations generate reproducible genotype–phenotype correlations (including site, morphology, and immunophenotype), and the methodologic premise that IHC detects protein presence or absence while sequencing detects nucleotide alterations.\n- Ensure internal assay validity: for IHC, specify the need for internal positive controls or external controls to distinguish true protein loss from technical artifact; for sequencing, specify a targeted approach appropriate to known mutational hotspots and include a strategy to avoid false negatives.\n- Explicitly differentiate PDGFRA-mutant GIST from SDH-deficient GIST and from non-GIST mimics that may occur in the stomach.\n- Provide a minimal yet complete sequence of steps that yields a reproducible, falsifiable classification.\n\nWhich of the following frameworks best meets these requirements?\n\nA. Confirm GIST lineage by DOG1 positivity; perform SDHB IHC with an internal positive control (e.g., non-neoplastic lamina propria cells) to assess SDH complex integrity; if SDHB staining is retained in tumor cells, exclude SDH-deficient GIST. Then perform targeted sequencing of PDGFRA exons $12$, $14$, and $18$ (with adequate tumor purity and coverage), and concurrently screen KIT exons $9$, $11$, $13$, and $17$ to document absence of KIT mutations. If a pathogenic PDGFRA mutation (commonly exon $18$, such as D842V) is detected, classify as PDGFRA-mutant GIST; if PDGFRA is wild-type, extend profiling to other wild-type GIST drivers (e.g., BRAF, neurofibromin 1 (NF1)) before finalizing classification.\n\nB. Classify as PDGFRA-mutant GIST based on gastric location, epithelioid morphology, and KIT negativity alone, because PDGFRA-mutant GISTs are typically KIT-negative and occur in the stomach; no further IHC or sequencing is necessary unless clinical therapy is being planned.\n\nC. Use SDHB IHC first; if tumor cells show loss of SDHB staining, infer a PDGFRA mutation because SDHB loss is a sensitive surrogate for PDGFRA-driven signaling. Proceed to PDGFRA exon $12$ sequencing only if SDHB staining is equivocal.\n\nD. Bypass SDHB IHC; perform sequencing for Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Beta (PDGFRB) exons and, if wild-type, assume SDH deficiency and classify as SDH-deficient GIST. DOG1 positivity ensures the diagnosis of GIST and supersedes the need to test PDGFRA.\n\nE. Confirm GIST lineage by DOG1 positivity; sequence only PDGFRA exon $12$ because exon $12$ is the most common mutational hotspot; if no mutation is identified, declare PDGFRA-wild-type KIT-negative GIST without further testing since DOG1 positivity excludes non-GIST mimics.", "solution": "**Rationale for the Correct Validation Framework**\n\nThe case presents a KIT-negative, DOG1-positive epithelioid tumor in the stomach. Strong DOG1 positivity confirms its GIST lineage. The primary differential diagnosis for KIT-negative gastric GISTs is between a *PDGFRA*-mutant GIST and a Succinate Dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient GIST. These are driven by mutually exclusive molecular pathways and require a systematic approach to distinguish.\n\nA scientifically sound framework must:\n1.  Use a test to differentiate the two main possibilities (SDH-competent vs. SDH-deficient).\n2.  Use molecular sequencing to confirm the specific driver mutation if the tumor is SDH-competent.\n3.  Incorporate appropriate controls to ensure the validity of each test.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\n*   **Option A is correct.** This framework follows a logical and efficient sequence. It begins by confirming GIST lineage with DOG1. It then uses SDHB immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a reliable surrogate marker for the integrity of the entire SDH complex. By specifying the need for an internal positive control, it ensures the test's validity. If SDHB protein is retained (ruling out SDH deficiency), it proceeds to targeted sequencing of the correct mutational hotspots in *PDGFRA* and *KIT* to identify the specific driver mutation. This approach is comprehensive, evidence-based, and includes contingency for rare \"triple-negative\" cases.\n\n*   **Option B is incorrect.** It relies on clinicopathologic correlations alone, which is insufficient for a definitive diagnosis as SDH-deficient GISTs share the same features. It improperly fails to exclude a key differential.\n\n*   **Option C is incorrect.** It contains a major factual error, stating that SDHB loss is a surrogate for *PDGFRA* signaling. In reality, SDHB loss defines SDH-deficient GIST, a separate entity from *PDGFRA*-mutant GIST.\n\n*   **Option D is incorrect.** It is flawed on multiple levels. It tests the wrong gene (*PDGFRB* instead of *PDGFRA*), bypasses the most direct test for SDH deficiency (SDHB IHC), and makes an unfounded assumption about SDH status based on sequencing results.\n\n*   **Option E is incorrect.** It fails to test for SDH deficiency and incorrectly identifies *PDGFRA* exon 12 as the most common hotspot for this tumor type, when it is in fact exon 18.\n\nTherefore, framework A represents the minimal, complete, and correct diagnostic pathway that integrates IHC and molecular testing according to modern pathology standards.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4373327"}]}
