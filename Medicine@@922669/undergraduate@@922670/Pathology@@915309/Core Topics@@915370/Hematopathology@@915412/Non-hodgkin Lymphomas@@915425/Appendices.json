The descriptions of the cases use standard, objective histopathological terminology. The lymphomas mentioned (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma, Mantle Cell Lymphoma, Extranodal Marginal Zone Lymphoma) are well-defined entities in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. The immunophenotypic markers listed (CD23, cyclin D1, SOX11) are standard ancillary tests used for the differential diagnosis of these entities. The foundational facts provided are correct: genetic alterations, like the $t(11;14)$ translocation causing cyclin D1 overexpression in Mantle Cell Lymphoma, are central to modern lymphoma classification. The problem is scientifically sound.\n\n2.  **Well-Posed:** For each case, the combination of clinical presentation and detailed histomorphology points strongly toward a single \"most likely\" diagnosis among the common small B-cell lymphomas. The question asks for this most likely diagnosis and its corresponding, well-established immunophenotype. A unique and correct answer can be derived. The problem is well-posed.\n\n3.  **Objective:** The case descriptions are based on observable features (cell morphology, tissue architecture, clinical signs) and are free from subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n4.  **Complete and Consistent:** Sufficient information is provided to make a high-confidence differential diagnosis. There are no internal contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated, scientifically sound question typical of advanced medical or pathology examinations. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe task is to diagnose three cases of small B-cell lymphoma and determine the expected immunophenotype for CD23, cyclin D1, and SOX11.\n\n**Analysis of Case $1$**\n*   **Clinical and Morphological Synthesis:** A $72$-year-old with generalized lymphadenopathy presents with a lymph node biopsy showing diffuse effacement by small, mature-appearing lymphocytes. The key features are the cytology of the small cells (\"small round lymphocytes with clumped chromatin,\" often described as 'soccer-ball' chromatin) and, most importantly, the presence of \"scattered pale areas composed of slightly larger cells... forming vaguely nodular aggregates\" with increased mitotic activity. These pale areas are pathognomonic proliferation centers (also called pseudofollicles).\n*   **Diagnosis:** This constellation of findings—a monomorphic population of small, round B-cells with clumped chromatin punctuated by proliferation centers—is the classic histopathological presentation of **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL)**.\n*   **Expected Immunophenotype:** CLL/SLL is a malignancy of mature B-cells that characteristically co-express the T-cell associated antigen $CD5$. For the markers in question:\n    *   CD23: CLL/SLL is typically positive, often described as bright or strong. This marker is crucial for distinguishing it from Mantle Cell Lymphoma, which is usually CD23 negative.\n    *   Cyclin D1: CLL/SLL is negative for cyclin D1. Positivity for cyclin D1 is the hallmark of Mantle Cell Lymphoma, driven by the $t(11;14)$ translocation.\n    *   SOX11: CLL/SLL is negative for SOX11. SOX11 is another marker typically positive in Mantle Cell Lymphoma.\n*   **Conclusion for Case $1$:** The diagnosis is CLL/SLL with an expected immunophenotype of CD23 positive, cyclin D1 negative, and SOX11 negative.\n\n**Analysis of Case $2$**\n*   **Clinical and Morphological Synthesis:** A $66$-year-old presents with a clinical syndrome of \"multiple small sessile polyps...throughout the colon,\" known as multiple lymphomatous polyposis. Biopsies reveal \"expanded mantle zones composed of small to medium lymphocytes with irregular, angulated nuclear contours.\"\n*   **Diagnosis:** The clinical presentation of multiple lymphomatous polyposis is a classic, albeit specific, presentation of **Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)** involving the gastrointestinal tract. The morphology of an expanded mantle zone pattern with atypical lymphocytes having irregular or angulated nuclei is also highly characteristic of MCL.\n*   **Expected Immunophenotype:** MCL is defined by the overexpression of cyclin D1 due to the $t(11;14)(q13;q32)$ chromosomal translocation.\n    *   CD23: MCL is characteristically negative for CD23.\n    *   Cyclin D1: MCL is, by definition, positive for cyclin D1. This is the single most important diagnostic marker.\n    *   SOX11: The vast majority of conventional MCL cases are positive for the transcription factor SOX11.\n*   **Conclusion for Case $2$:** The diagnosis is MCL with an expected immunophenotype of CD23 negative, cyclin D1 positive, and SOX11 positive.\n\n**Analysis of Case $3$**\n*   **Clinical and Morphological Synthesis:** A $58$-year-old with chronic dyspepsia undergoes a gastric biopsy. The histology shows \"dense infiltrates of small B-cells with pale cytoplasm\" (so-called monocytoid B-cells) that are centered on the marginal zones of reactive lymphoid follicles. The most specific finding is the presence of \"lymphoepithelial lesions,\" which are aggregates of neoplastic B-cells infiltrating and destroying gastric glandular epithelium. Focal plasmacytic differentiation is also a common feature.\n*   **Diagnosis:** This combination of location (stomach), morphology (marginal zone pattern of infiltration by monocytoid B-cells), and the pathognomonic presence of lymphoepithelial lesions defines **Extranodal Marginal Zone Lymphoma of Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT lymphoma)**.\n*   **Expected Immunophenotype:** MALT lymphomas are mature B-cell neoplasms that are typically negative for the markers used to diagnose CLL/SLL and MCL.\n    *   CD23: MALT lymphoma is negative for CD23.\n    *   Cyclin D1: MALT lymphoma is negative for cyclin D1.\n    *   SOX11: MALT lymphoma is negative for SOX11.\n*   **Conclusion for Case $3$:** The diagnosis is MALT lymphoma with an expected immunophenotype of CD23 negative, cyclin D1 negative, and SOX11 negative.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    *   Case $1$: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma; CD23 bright, cyclin D1 negative, SOX11 negative. This aligns perfectly with our analysis for Case $1$.\n    *   Case $2$: Mantle cell lymphoma; CD23 negative, cyclin D1 positive, SOX11 positive. This aligns perfectly with our analysis for Case $2$.\n    *   Case $3$: Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue; CD23 negative, cyclin D1 negative, SOX11 negative.

The morphology is classic for CLL/SLL.\n    *   Case $2$: Incorrect diagnosis (Marginal zone lymphoma). The presentation and morphology are classic for MCL.\n    *   Case $3$: Incorrect diagnosis (CLL/SLL). The location and presence of lymphoepithelial lesions are diagnostic of MALT lymphoma.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    *   Case $1$: Correct diagnosis (CLL/SLL), but the immunophenotype is incorrect (CD23 negative, SOX11 positive is the opposite of what is expected).\n    *   Case $2$: Correct diagnosis (MCL), but the immunophenotype is incorrect (CD23 positive, cyclin D1 negative is characteristic of CLL/SLL, not MCL).\n    *   Case $3$: Correct diagnosis (Marginal zone lymphoma), but the immunophenotype is incorrect (CD23 positive is incorrect).\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    *   Case $1$: Incorrect diagnosis (Marginal zone lymphoma). This is a nodal lymphoma with features of CLL/SLL.\n    *   Case $2$: Incorrect diagnosis (CLL/SLL). The presentation is classic for MCL.\n    *   Case $3$: Incorrect diagnosis (MCL). The histopathology (lymphoepithelial lesions) is pathognomonic for MALT lymphoma.

A definitive solution can be derived by applying the specified algorithm to the given data.\n\n---\n\n## Derivation of Solution\n\nThe classification of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) into Germinal Center B-cell (GCB) and non-Germinal Center B-cell (non-GCB) subtypes using the Hans algorithm is based on a sequential evaluation of the immunohistochemical expression of CD10, BCL6, and MUM1.\n\nThe Hans algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Evaluate CD10 expression.**\n    -   If CD10 is positive ($\\geq 30\\%$ of tumor cells), the case is classified as **GCB** subtype. The algorithm terminates.\n\n2.  **If CD10 is negative, evaluate BCL6 expression.**\n    -   If BCL6 is negative ($< 30\\%$ of tumor cells), the case is classified as **non-GCB** subtype. The algorithm terminates.\n    -   If BCL6 is positive ($\\geq 30\\%$ of tumor cells), proceed to the next step.\n\n3.  **If CD10 is negative and BCL6 is positive, evaluate MUM1 expression.**\n    -   If MUM1 is negative ($< 30\\%$ of tumor cells), the case is classified as **GCB** subtype.\n    -   If MUM1 is positive ($\\geq 30\\%$ of tumor cells), the case is classified as **non-GCB** subtype.\n\nNow, we apply the patient's data to this algorithm:\n\n-   **Given IHC results**:\n    -   CD10: negative\n    -   BCL6: positive ($60\\% \\geq 30\\%$)\n    -   MUM1: positive ($50\\% \\geq 30\\%$)\n\n**Applying the algorithm step-by-step**:\n\n1.  **CD10 status**: The tumor is CD10 negative. Therefore, we do not classify it as GCB at this step and must proceed.\n\n2.  **BCL6 status**: Since CD10 is negative, we next check BCL6. The tumor is BCL6 positive. Therefore, we do not classify it as non-GCB at this step and must proceed.\n\n3.  **MUM1 status**: Since CD10 is negative and BCL6 is positive, we finally check MUM1. The tumor is MUM1 positive.\n\nFollowing this path (CD10 negative $\\rightarrow$ BCL6 positive $\\rightarrow$ MUM1 positive), the Hans algorithm classifies the case as **non-Germinal Center B-cell (non-GCB) subtype**.\n\n## Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Germinal Center B-cell (GCB) subtype, because BCL6 positivity indicates germinal center derivation even when CD10 is negative and MUM1 is positive.**\n-   The classification of GCB is incorrect. As derived above, the correct classification is non-GCB.\n-   The justification is invalid within the context of the Hans algorithm. Although BCL6 is a germinal center marker, for a CD10-negative case, the algorithm's final decision depends on the MUM1 status. Specifically, the combination of CD10 negative, BCL6 positive, and MUM1 positive defines the non-GCB subtype, not the GCB subtype.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Non-Germinal Center B-cell (non-GCB; activated B-cell-like) subtype, because absence of CD10 followed by presence of MUM1 defines non-GCB in the Hans algorithm regardless of BCL6 status.**\n-   The classification of non-GCB is correct.\n-   The justification is logically sound in the context of this case. Let's analyze it: \"absence of CD10 followed by presence of MUM1 defines non-GCB... regardless of BCL6 status.\" In the Hans algorithm, if a case is CD10 negative, we proceed to BCL6.\n    -   If BCL6 is negative, the case is non-GCB. MUM1 is not even tested.\n    -   If BCL6 is positive, we test MUM1. If MUM1 is positive (as in this case), the case is non-GCB.\n    -   Therefore, for any CD10-negative case, if MUM1 is positive, the final classification will always be non-GCB. If BCL6 were negative, it would be non-GCB. If BCL6 were positive, it would also be non-GCB. The justification correctly identifies the determinative role of MUM1 positivity in a CD10-negative setting.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Unclassifiable by the Hans algorithm, because conflicting expression of BCL6 and MUM1 requires gene-expression profiling rather than IHC surrogates.**\n-   The conclusion that the case is \"unclassifiable\" is incorrect. The Hans algorithm is specifically designed to resolve such immunophenotypes into a definitive category. The combination CD10-, BCL6+, MUM1+ has a definite outcome (non-GCB).\n-   Such expression is not considered \"conflicting\" in a way that makes the algorithm fail; it is a recognized pattern with a specific classification.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Germinal Center B-cell (GCB) subtype, because two of three markers are positive and majority positivity rules apply for classification.**\n-   The classification of GCB is incorrect.\n-   The justification is fundamentally wrong. The Hans algorithm is a sequential, hierarchical decision tree, not a voting system or a \"majority rules\" classification. The order in which the markers are evaluated is critical. Applying a simple count of positive markers (BCL6 and MUM1 are positive, CD10 is negative) is not how the algorithm works and leads to an incorrect conclusion.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4413857"}, {"introduction": "Modern pathology extends beyond diagnosis to provide crucial prognostic information that guides patient care.

The International Prognostic Index (IPI) assigns $1$ point for each of the following risk factors present at diagnosis: age greater than $60$ years, elevated LDH above the laboratory upper limit of normal, ECOG performance status greater than or equal to $2$, Ann Arbor stage $\\mathrm{III}$ or $\\mathrm{IV}$, and involvement of greater than $1$ extranodal site.

Report only the estimated $5$-year OS probability as a decimal. Round your final numerical answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It presents a standard application of survival analysis principles in a clinical oncology context. We may therefore proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part process: first, to derive the relationship between the survival function of a risk stratum and a baseline survival function under the proportional hazards assumption; and second, to apply this relationship to calculate the $5$-year overall survival (OS) for the specified patient.\n\nFirst, let us derive the general relationship. The survival function, $S(t)$, is the probability of an individual surviving beyond time $t$. It is related to the hazard function, $h(t)$, which represents the instantaneous risk of the event (death) at time $t$, given survival until time $t$. The relationship is defined as:\n$$S(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^t h(\\tau) d\\tau\\right) = \\exp(-H(t))$$\nwhere $H(t) = \\int_0^t h(\\tau) d\\tau$ is the cumulative hazard function.\n\nThe problem states that the proportional hazards assumption holds. This means that the hazard function for a given risk stratum $i$, $h_i(t)$, is a constant multiple of the baseline hazard function, $h_0(t)$. The constant of proportionality is the hazard ratio, $\\mathrm{HR}_i$.\n$$h_i(t) = h_0(t) \\times \\mathrm{HR}_i$$\nThe baseline hazard function $h_0(t)$ corresponds to the low-risk stratum (International Prognostic Index, IPI, score of $0$).\n\nTo find the survival function for stratum $i$, $S_i(t)$, we first compute its cumulative hazard function, $H_i(t)$:\n$$H_i(t) = \\int_0^t h_i(\\tau) d\\tau = \\int_0^t (h_0(\\tau) \\times \\mathrm{HR}_i) d\\tau = \\mathrm{HR}_i \\int_0^t h_0(\\tau) d\\tau$$\nRecognizing that $\\int_0^t h_0(\\tau) d\\tau = H_0(t)$, the cumulative hazard for the baseline stratum, we have:\n$$H_i(t) = \\mathrm{HR}_i \\times H_0(t)$$\nNow, we can write the survival function for stratum $i$ as:\n$$S_i(t) = \\exp(-H_i(t)) = \\exp(-\\mathrm{HR}_i \\times H_0(t))$$\nFor the baseline stratum (IPI $0$), the hazard ratio is $\\mathrm{HR}_0 = 1$, and its survival function is $S_0(t) = \\exp(-H_0(t))$. From this, we can express the baseline cumulative hazard function in terms of the baseline survival function:\n$$H_0(t) = -\\ln(S_0(t))$$\nSubstituting this expression for $H_0(t)$ into the equation for $S_i(t)$:\n$$S_i(t) = \\exp(-\\mathrm{HR}_i \\times [-\\ln(S_0(t))]) = \\exp(\\mathrm{HR}_i \\ln(S_0(t)))$$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $a \\ln(b) = \\ln(b^a)$, this becomes:\n$$S_i(t) = \\exp(\\ln(S_0(t)^{\\mathrm{HR}_i}))$$\nSince the exponential and natural logarithm are inverse functions, we arrive at the final derived relationship:\n$$S_i(t) = S_0(t)^{\\mathrm{HR}_i}$$\nThis equation connects the survival probability at time $t$ for any risk stratum $i$ to the baseline survival probability at the same time point, via the stratum's specific hazard ratio.\n\nNext, we must calculate the IPI score for the patient to determine their risk stratum. The IPI score is the sum of points for five risk factors ($1$ point for each present):\n1.  Age > $60$ years: The patient's age is $72$, which is greater than $60$. This yields $1$ point.\n2.  Elevated serum Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH): The patient has an elevated LDH. This yields $1$ point.\n3.  ECOG performance status $\\geq 2$: The patient's ECOG status is $1$, which is not greater than or equal to $2$. This yields $0$ points.\n4.  Ann Arbor stage $\\mathrm{III}$ or $\\mathrm{IV}$: The patient's stage is $\\mathrm{III}$. This yields $1$ point.\n5.  Involvement of > $1$ extranodal site: The patient has involvement of exactly $1$ extranodal site, which is not greater than $1$. This yields $0$ points.\n\nThe total IPI score for this patient is the sum of these points:\n$$\\text{IPI Score} = 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 3$$\nThe patient is in the IPI $3$ risk stratum.\n\nAccording to the provided data, the hazard ratio for the IPI $3$ stratum, relative to the IPI $0$ stratum, is $\\mathrm{HR}_3 = 2.60$.\nThe problem also provides the $5$-year OS for the baseline cohort (IPI $0$): $S_0(5\\ \\mathrm{years}) = 0.78$.\n\nWe can now use the derived formula to calculate the patient's estimated $5$-year OS, $S_3(5\\ \\mathrm{years})$. Let $t = 5\\ \\mathrm{years}$.\n$$S_3(5) = S_0(5)^{\\mathrm{HR}_3}$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$S_3(5) = (0.78)^{2.60}$$\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$S_3(5) \\approx 0.524140...$$\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$S_3(5) \\approx 0.524$$\nThus, the estimated $5$-year overall survival probability for this patient is $0.524$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.524}$$", "id": "4413925"}]}
