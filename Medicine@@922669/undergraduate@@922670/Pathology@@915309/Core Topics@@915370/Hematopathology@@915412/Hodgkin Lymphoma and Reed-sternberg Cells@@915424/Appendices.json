Mastering this synthesis of information is essential for distinguishing between entities that have different prognoses and treatments, such as the lymphocyte-rich subtype of classical Hodgkin lymphoma and its mimics. [@problem_id:4381352]", "problem": "A lymph node excision from a $38$-year-old individual with painless cervical lymphadenopathy shows on hematoxylin and eosin (HE) sections a partially nodular architecture. The nodules are composed predominantly of small mature lymphocytes with rare eosinophils and histiocytes. Scattered within the nodules are large atypical mono- and binucleated cells with prominent eosinophilic nucleoli and perinucleolar clearing, consistent with Reed–Sternberg (RS) cells and their variants. There are no thick collagen bands and no prominent necrosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) performed on the large atypical cells demonstrates CD30+, CD15+, weak PAX5+, CD20-, CD45-, EMA-, and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase)-. Epstein–Barr virus-encoded RNA (EBER) in situ hybridization is negative in the large cells. The background small lymphocytes are predominantly B cells that are CD20+ and PAX5+.\n\nUsing the following foundational facts as your starting point:\n- Immunophenotypic markers identify lineage and activation state: PAX5 indicates B-cell lineage commitment; CD20 and CD45 are pan–B-cell and pan-leukocyte markers, respectively; CD30 and CD15 are activation-associated antigens frequently expressed on classical Reed–Sternberg cells.\n- In classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), RS cells derive from germinal center B cells but exhibit attenuation of the B-cell transcriptional program, typically showing CD30+, CD15+, weak PAX5+, and lack of CD20 and CD45. In nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL), the neoplastic “lymphocyte predominant (LP)” cells retain B-cell identity, characteristically CD20+, CD45+, strong PAX5+, and are usually CD30- and CD15-.\n- Subclassification of cHL relies on background composition and architecture: lymphocyte-rich cHL features a lymphocyte-predominant background (often nodular) with scarce eosinophils and classical RS cells, whereas mixed cellularity cHL shows abundant eosinophils and histiocytes in a diffuse background and frequently lacks a nodular pattern.\n- Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a T-cell lymphoma that is CD30+ but typically PAX5-, often EMA+, variably ALK+ or ALK-, and usually CD45+.\n\nWhich diagnosis best integrates the morphology and immunophenotype?\n\nA.

Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALK-negative\n\nE. Mixed cellularity classical Hodgkin lymphoma", "solution": "Begin by aligning the immunophenotype with lineage and disease categories based on first principles of immunohistochemistry and disease definitions. The large atypical cells are CD30+ and CD15+, with weak PAX5+ and loss of pan–B-cell (CD20) and pan-leukocyte (CD45) markers. PAX5 is a B-cell lineage transcription factor, so weak PAX5 supports a B-cell derivation, but the absence of CD20 and CD45 indicates attenuation of typical B-cell and leukocyte antigen expression. This constellation—CD30+, CD15+, weak PAX5+, CD20-, CD45-—is characteristic of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), reflecting the known biology that classical Reed–Sternberg (RS) cells derive from germinal center B cells but downregulate the B-cell program.\n\nNext, integrate morphology to subclassify within cHL. The histology shows a predominantly lymphocyte-rich background with a nodular pattern, rare eosinophils and histiocytes, and scattered classic RS cells. These features support lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma as opposed to mixed cellularity classical Hodgkin lymphoma, which classically shows a diffuse architecture with numerous eosinophils and histiocytes and often lacks nodularity.\n\nNow analyze each option:\n\nA. Lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma. This aligns with both immunophenotype and morphology. The RS cell immunoprofile (CD30+, CD15+, weak PAX5+, CD20-, CD45-) is prototypical for cHL. The nodular, lymphocyte-predominant background with few eosinophils and absence of sclerosis fits the lymphocyte-rich subtype of cHL. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL). In NLPHL, the neoplastic LP (“popcorn”) cells retain B-cell antigens: they are typically CD20+, CD45+, BCL6+, OCT2+, BOB1+, strongly PAX5+, and usually CD30- and CD15-. The case shows the opposite pattern in the large cells (CD30+, CD15+, CD20-, CD45-, weak PAX5+), and the morphology includes classic RS cells rather than LP cells. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma (THRLBCL). THRLBCL has scattered large neoplastic B cells that are CD20+, CD45+, and strongly PAX5+ amid abundant T cells and histiocytes; CD30 expression is not a defining feature. The immunophenotype here lacks CD20 and CD45 on the large cells and shows CD30+ and CD15+, favoring cHL rather than THRLBCL. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALK-negative (ALCL, ALK-). ALCL is a T-cell lymphoma in which large neoplastic cells are CD30+ and often EMA+, typically PAX5-, and usually CD45+. The large cells in this case are EMA-, PAX5+ (even if weak), and CD45-, which argues against ALCL. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nE. Mixed cellularity classical Hodgkin lymphoma. While the immunophenotype is compatible with cHL, the morphology does not match: mixed cellularity cHL features a diffuse background rich in eosinophils and histiocytes and typically lacks a nodular, lymphocyte-rich pattern. The described nodular, lymphocyte-predominant background with rare eosinophils supports the lymphocyte-rich subtype instead.

The provided data are sufficient and relevant for determining the clinical stage, bulky status, and appropriate initial treatment intent based on established oncological principles. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. Therefore, a full analysis can proceed.\n\n### Analysis of the Clinical Case\n\nThe solution requires a step-by-step application of standard diagnostic and staging criteria for classical Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\n#### 1. Diagnosis\nThe diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma is unequivocally established by the excisional biopsy findings. The presence of classic Reed-Sternberg cells within a mixed inflammatory milieu is the histological hallmark. This is confirmed by the immunohistochemical staining profile: positive for cluster of differentiation 30 (CD30) and cluster of differentiation 15 (CD15), and negative for leukocyte common antigen (CD45). This profile is pathognomonic for the Reed-Sternberg cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\n#### 2. Staging (Ann Arbor System with Cotswolds Modifications)\nStaging determines the extent of the disease and is critical for treatment planning.\n\n*   **Anatomic Stage:** The patient has hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy in the left supraclavicular region and the mediastinum. Both of these lymph node regions are located above the diaphragm. According to the Ann Arbor staging system, the involvement of two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm constitutes **Stage II** disease. The Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT) scan confirms that there is no disease below the diaphragm and no diffuse involvement of extralymphatic organs. The negative bone marrow biopsy further confirms the absence of Stage IV disease.\n\n*   **Symptom Designation (A/B):** The patient reports intermittent fever, drenching night sweats, and unintentional weight loss. The presence of any of the following systemic \"B symptoms\" warrants a 'B' designation:\n    1.  Unexplained fever with a temperature above $38^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$.\n    2.  Drenching night sweats.\n    3.  Unexplained weight loss of more than $10\\%$ of body weight in the $6$ months before diagnosis.\n    The patient has fever and drenching night sweats. Although the reported weight loss of approximately $5\\%$ does not meet the formal criterion, the presence of the other two B symptoms is sufficient. Therefore, the patient is symptomatic, and the full stage is **Stage IIB**.\n\n#### 3. Bulky Disease Status\nThe Cotswolds modifications to the Ann Arbor system introduced the concept of \"bulky\" disease, which is an adverse prognostic factor. For mediastinal disease, bulky status is commonly defined as a mass with a maximal dimension of $\\geq 10\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ or a mediastinal mass ratio greater than one-third of the intrathoracic diameter.\n*   The patient's mediastinal mass measures $9\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ in maximal dimension.\n*   Since $9\\ \\mathrm{cm}  10\\ \\mathrm{cm}$, and no information on the thoracic ratio is given, the disease is classified as **non-bulky** based on the provided data.\n\n#### 4. Treatment Intent and Strategy\nHodgkin lymphoma, especially in a young patient (age $28$) with limited-stage disease (even if unfavorable), is a highly curable malignancy. The primary treatment intent is therefore **curative**. Palliative therapy is reserved for cases of relapse/refractory disease or for patients unable to tolerate curative treatment, none of which apply here.\n\nThe patient has early-stage (Stage IIB) but unfavorable disease due to the presence of B symptoms. For unfavorable early-stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma, the standard of care is **combined-modality therapy (CMT)**. This typically involves a defined number of cycles of a multiagent chemotherapy regimen (such as ABVD: Adriamycin, Bleomycin, Vinblastine, Dacarbazine) followed by consolidative involved-site radiotherapy (ISRT) to the initially involved nodal regions. Radiotherapy alone is not a standard option for Stage IIB disease.\n\n### Summary of Findings\n*   **Stage:** Stage IIB\n*   **Bulky Status:** Non-bulky\n*   **Treatment:** Curative-intent combined-modality therapy (chemotherapy plus radiotherapy)\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Stage $IIA$ non-bulky; palliative radiotherapy because of mediastinal involvement**\n*   **Stage:** Incorrect. The patient has B symptoms (fever, night sweats), which defines the stage as IIB, not IIA.\n*   **Bulky Status:** \"Non-bulky\" is correct.\n*   **Treatment:** Incorrect. The treatment intent is curative, not palliative. Radiotherapy alone is not the standard of care for Stage IIB disease.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. Stage $IIB$ bulky; aggressive palliative chemotherapy due to systemic symptoms**\n*   **Stage:** \"Stage IIB\" is correct.\n*   **Bulky Status:** Incorrect. The $9\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ mass does not meet the $\\geq 10\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ criterion for bulky disease.\n*   **Treatment:** Incorrect. The treatment intent is curative, not palliative. Using the term \"palliative\" for first-line therapy in this context is a fundamental error.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Stage $IIB$ non-bulky; curative combined-modality therapy with multiagent chemotherapy plus involved-site radiotherapy**\n*   **Stage:** Correct. The patient has Stage II disease with B symptoms.\n*   **Bulky Status:** Correct. The $9\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ mass is non-bulky.\n*   **Treatment:** Correct. The intent is curative, and the standard treatment for unfavorable early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma is combined-modality therapy involving chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\n*   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**D. Stage $IIIB$; curative radiotherapy alone, given contiguous nodal spread**\n*   **Stage:** Incorrect. Stage III requires lymph node involvement on both sides of the diaphragm. This patient's disease is confined above the diaphragm.\n*   **Treatment:** Incorrect. Radiotherapy alone is inadequate for Stage IIB disease, and certainly for Stage IIIB. The primary modality would be chemotherapy.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Stage $IVB$; palliative corticosteroids with observation**\n*   **Stage:** Incorrect. Stage IV requires disseminated involvement of extralymphatic organs, which was ruled out by PET-CT and bone marrow biopsy.\n*   **Treatment:** Incorrect.
