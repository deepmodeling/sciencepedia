The provided histological and immunophenotypic data is coherent and represents a plausible case. The terminology and diagnostic principles cited (WHO classification, cell-of-origin) are central to modern lymphoma pathology. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to determine the most likely diagnosis and evaluate the differential diagnoses provided in the options. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors in the problem statement.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Diagnosis**\n\nThe presented case is a lymphoma characterized by a diffuse proliferation of large atypical lymphoid cells. The first step is to determine the cell lineage.\n\n$1$. **Lineage Determination**: The tumor cells are positive for CD$20$, a B-cell marker, and negative for CD$3$, a T-cell marker. This combination establishes the diagnosis of a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL).\n\n$2$. **Subclassification of Large B-cell Lymphoma**: The morphology (diffuse proliferation of large cells) in an older adult strongly suggests an aggressive B-cell lymphoma, with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) being the most common type. Other major differentials for a large B-cell lymphoma include Burkitt lymphoma (BL), high-grade follicular lymphoma (FL G$3$B), and the blastoid variant of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The IHC panel is used to differentiate these entities and to subclassify DLBCL based on the cell-of-origin (COO).\n\n$3$. **Cell-of-Origin (COO) Classification for DLBCL**: The Hans algorithm is a commonly used IHC-based surrogate for COO classification, dividing DLBCL into germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) and activated B-cell-like (ABC) or non-GCB types. The algorithm uses CD$10$, BCL$6$, and MUM$1$.\n    - GCB phenotype: CD$10$+ or (CD$10$- and BCL$6$+ and MUM$1$-)\n    - Non-GCB/ABC phenotype: CD$10$- and BCL$6$- or (CD$10$- and BCL$6$+ and MUM$1$+)\n\nApplying the patient's IHC results to the Hans algorithm:\n- CD$10$: Negative\n- BCL$6$: Positive\n- MUM$1$: Positive\n\nThe pattern (CD$10$-, BCL$6$+, MUM$1$+) corresponds to the **non-GCB/ABC phenotype** of DLBCL. Thus, the most probable diagnosis is DLBCL, not otherwise specified (NOS), of the ABC subtype.\n\n$4$. **Evaluation of Differential Diagnoses**:\n- **Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)**: The vast majority of MCL cases, including the aggressive blastoid variant, are characterized by the t($11$;$14$) translocation, leading to overexpression of Cyclin D$1$. The provided result of **Cyclin D1 negativity** is a strong and virtually definitive feature against the diagnosis of MCL.\n- **Burkitt Lymphoma (BL)**: Classic BL is characterized by a specific immunophenotype: CD$10$+, BCL$6$+, BCL$2$-, and a Ki-$67$ proliferation index near $100\\%$. Critically, classic BL is **MUM1 negative**. The patient's phenotype of **CD10 negativity** and **MUM1 positivity** effectively excludes classic BL.\n- **Follicular Lymphoma (FL)**: FL is typically a germinal center-derived lymphoma, characterized by positivity for CD$10$ and BCL$6$. While high-grade FL (Grade $3$B) consists of diffuse sheets of large B-cells, the expected phenotype is CD$10$+. The **CD10 negativity** in this case makes FL an unlikely diagnosis. The overall profile points more strongly to an ABC-type DLBCL.\n- **Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL)**: This is a malignancy of T-cells. The tumor cells must express T-cell lineage markers, such as CD$3$. This case is definitively **CD3 negative** and **CD20 positive**, thus it is a B-cell lymphoma, and PTCL is ruled out.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation**: The combination of clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic features points unequivocally to a diagnosis of Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma, Not Otherwise Specified (DLBCL, NOS), of the Activated B-cell (ABC) or non-GCB subtype.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (DLBCL, NOS), activated B-cell (ABC) phenotype; ruled in by CD20 positivity, CD3 negativity, diffuse architecture, and CD10 negativity with BCL6 positivity and MUM1 positivity; ruled out alternatives by cyclin D$1$ negativity (excluding mantle cell lymphoma), lack of follicular architecture and CD10 negativity (excluding follicular lymphoma), and MUM1 positivity with CD10 negativity (excluding Burkitt lymphoma).**\n- This option correctly identifies the diagnosis as DLBCL, ABC-type.\n- The reasoning for inclusion is sound: it correctly identifies the lineage (CD$20$+, CD$3$-), morphology (diffuse, large cells), and the specific IHC pattern (CD$10$-, BCL$6$+, MUM$1$+) that defines the ABC subtype via the Hans algorithm.\n- The reasoning for exclusion of alternatives is also correct and precise: Cyclin D$1$ negativity rules out MCL; CD$10$ negativity makes FL unlikely; and the combination of CD$10$ negativity and MUM$1$ positivity rules out classic BL.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Follicular lymphoma grade $3$B; supported by BCL6 positivity and diffuse sheets of large cells; ruled out alternatives by CD20 positivity; the absence of cyclin D$1$ is non-contributory.**\n- The diagnosis is incorrect. While FL grade $3$B can have diffuse architecture and expresses BCL$6$, it is typically CD$10$ positive. The presented phenotype is more consistent with DLBCL, ABC-type.\n- The reasoning is flawed. Stating that alternatives are \"ruled out by CD$20$ positivity\" is nonsensical, as CD$20$ is positive in almost all B-cell lymphomas, which are the main alternatives.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Burkitt lymphoma; supported by large cell size and BCL6 positivity; ruled out alternatives by CD20 positivity and CD3 negativity; CD10 negativity and MUM1 positivity are not decisive.**\n- The diagnosis is incorrect.\n- The reasoning is flawed. The statement that \"CD$10$ negativity and MUM$1$ positivity are not decisive\" is factually wrong. These two markers are critical for the differential diagnosis with BL and are strong evidence against it. Furthermore, ruling out other B-cell lymphomas via CD$20$ positivity is illogical.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Mantle cell lymphoma, blastoid variant; supported by diffuse architecture and large cells; ruled out alternatives by CD20 positivity; cyclin D$1$ negativity does not exclude this subtype.**\n- The diagnosis is incorrect.\n- The reasoning is flawed. The claim that \"cyclin D$1$ negativity does not exclude this subtype\" is misleading in this context. While exceedingly rare exceptions exist, for all standard diagnostic purposes, cyclin D$1$ negativity is considered a definitive feature to rule out MCL. The rule-out criteria (\"by CD$20$ positivity\") are also nonsensical.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS); supported by diffuse architecture and large cells; ruled out alternatives by negativity for CD10 and cyclin D$1$; CD3 negativity is not definitive.**\n- The diagnosis is incorrect. This is a B-cell lymphoma.\n- The reasoning is fundamentally flawed. The statement that \"CD$3$ negativity is not definitive\" is incorrect. The absence of the pan-T-cell marker CD$3$ on the neoplastic cells absolutely excludes a T-cell lymphoma.

It uses standard diagnostic modalities (histology, IHC, FISH) and terminology (CD markers, gene names like MYC, BCL2, BCL6) that are central to the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Haematolymphoid Tumours. The described constellation of findings represents a recognized clinical entity.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The provided data is comprehensive and sufficient to arrive at a specific diagnosis according to established international classification schemes.

The high Ki-$67$ index is consistent with the numerous mitoses and the high-grade nature of the lymphoma.

It presents a classic diagnostic challenge in hematopathology that can be resolved by applying the established rules of the current WHO classification.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe diagnosis of lymphomas is a multi-step process that integrates morphology, immunophenotype, and genetic findings, as stipulated by the WHO classification.\n\n1.  **Initial Assessment (Morphology and Lineage):** The biopsy shows a diffuse proliferation of large lymphoid cells, confirming a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma-like morphology. The expression of CD20 confirms the B-cell lineage. The high mitotic rate, high Ki-$67$ index of approximately $95\\%$, and presence of tangible-body macrophages (giving a \"starry-sky\" appearance) all point towards a very aggressive, high-grade lymphoma.\n\n2.  **Cell-of-Origin (COO) Assessment (Immunophenotype):** The lymphoma cells express both CD10 and BCL6. This immunoprofile is characteristic of a germinal center B-cell (GCB) origin. The expression of BCL2 protein is also noted.\n\n3.  **Genetic Assessment (FISH):** This is the most critical step for precise classification in this case. The FISH analysis reveals rearrangements of both the *MYC* gene and the *BCL2* gene. There is no *BCL6* rearrangement.\n\n4.  **Integration and Final Classification (Applying WHO Criteria):** The WHO classification for haematolymphoid tumors has a specific category for B-cell lymphomas that possess rearrangements of *MYC* in combination with rearrangements of *BCL2* and/or *BCL6*. These are colloquially known as \"double-hit\" or \"triple-hit\" lymphomas.\n    *   The definitive diagnostic criterion for \"High-grade B-cell lymphoma with *MYC* and *BCL2* rearrangements\" is the presence of a high-grade B-cell lymphoma (typically with morphology of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or intermediate between DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma) that demonstrates, by FISH or other cytogenetic methods, rearrangements of the *MYC* gene and the *BCL2* gene.\n    *   The case presented fulfills these criteria precisely: it is a high-grade B-cell neoplasm with documented rearrangements of *MYC* and *BCL2*.\n\nThis specific genetic finding defines the entity and takes precedence over less specific classifications like \"DLBCL, NOS.\"\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **A. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, germinal center B-cell–type (DLBCL, NOS, GCB subtype):** This diagnosis is incorrect. While the lymphoma has the morphology and GCB-immunophenotype of a DLBCL, the term \"Not Otherwise Specified\" (NOS) is reserved for cases that do not meet the criteria for specific, genetically-defined entities. Since this lymphoma has concurrent *MYC* and *BCL2* rearrangements, it must be classified into the more specific HGBL category. The presence of the \"double hit\" genetics precludes a diagnosis of DLBCL, NOS. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B. Burkitt lymphoma:** This diagnosis is incorrect. While the high Ki-$67$ index ($>95\\%$) and \"starry sky\" morphology are characteristic of Burkitt lymphoma (BL), a defining feature of classic BL is an isolated *MYC* rearrangement without a concurrent *BCL2* or *BCL6* rearrangement. The presence of a *BCL2* rearrangement in this case explicitly excludes the diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. High-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements:** This diagnosis is correct. It is the specific entity defined by the WHO classification for high-grade B-cell lymphomas that harbor rearrangements of both the *MYC* and *BCL2* genes. All the features described in the problem—the morphology, immunophenotype, and, most importantly, the specific genetic profile—are the defining characteristics of this diagnosis. This is the most precise classification possible. **Correct.**\n\n*   **D. High-grade B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (HGBL, NOS):** This diagnosis is incorrect. The HGBL, NOS category is a diagnosis of exclusion for cases that have morphological features intermediate between DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma (\"blastoid\" or \"Burkitt-like\" features) but *lack* the *MYC* and *BCL2*/*BCL6* rearrangements that define double/triple-hit lymphomas. Since this case *has* the definitive rearrangements, it does not belong in the NOS category. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Follicular lymphoma grade 3B with transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma:** This diagnosis is incorrect. A key piece of evidence for this diagnosis would be the presence of a follicular growth pattern, at least focally, representing the underlying follicular lymphoma.

All terminology (e.g., \"hallmark cells,\" \"CD$30$,\" \"ALK,\" \"DUSP$22$ rearrangement\"), diagnostic techniques (IHC, FISH, TCR gene rearrangement studies), and classification concepts (WHO, ICC) are standard and factually correct within this medical discipline. The constellation of findings represents a recognized, albeit specific, disease entity.\n*   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a comprehensive set of clinical, morphological, immunophenotypic, and genetic data.

It presents a realistic and formalizable diagnostic challenge in pathology. No flaws are identified. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Solution\n\nBased on the provided data and the principles of lymphoma classification, we can synthesize a diagnosis step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Lineage determination**: The demonstration of a clonal T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement unequivocally establishes the lymphoma as a mature T-cell neoplasm. This immediately rules out any B-cell lymphomas or Hodgkin lymphoma, which is of B-cell origin.\n2.  **Morphology and Key Immunophenotype**: The presence of \"sheets of large anaplastic cells\" with \"hallmark morphology\" (kidney-shaped nuclei, paranuclear clearing) combined with \"uniform, strong\" expression of CD$30$ are the defining features of Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL). The cohesive and sinusoidal growth patterns are also classic for ALCL. EMA positivity further supports this diagnosis.\n3.  **Subtyping of ALCL based on ALK status**: The negative immunostaining for ALK protein classifies this as ALK-negative ALCL. This is a critical distinction, as ALK-positive and ALK-negative ALCL are considered distinct entities with different genetic drivers and prognoses.\n4.  **Further genetic stratification**: The finding of a *DUSP22* gene rearrangement at the $6p25$ locus identifies a specific, recurrent genetic subtype of ALK-negative ALCL. This subtype, sometimes referred to as *DUSP22*-rearranged ALCL, is recognized by the WHO and ICC classifications and is associated with a more favorable prognosis compared to other ALK-negative ALCLs.\n5.  **Exclusion of other CD30-positive T-cell lymphomas**:\n    *   **Primary Cutaneous ALCL (pcALCL)**: This is excluded by the clinical presentation. The patient has systemic nodal disease (above and below the diaphragm) and the disease is not limited to the skin. pcALCL is defined by its primary presentation in the skin.\n    *   **Breast Implant-Associated ALCL (BIA-ALCL)**: This is excluded by the explicit statement of \"no history of breast implants.\" Furthermore, BIA-ALCL is characteristically negative for *DUSP22* rearrangements.\n    *   **Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma, Not Otherwise Specified (PTCL-NOS)**: PTCL-NOS is a diagnosis of exclusion. The presence of the specific \"hallmark\" morphology and uniform, strong CD$30$ expression are defining features of ALCL and preclude a diagnosis of PTCL-NOS.\n6.  **Exclusion of other differential diagnoses**:\n    *   **Classic Hodgkin Lymphoma**: Ruled out by the T-cell lineage (clonal TCR rearrangement) and the morphology of cohesive sheets of tumor cells, as opposed to the scattered Reed-Sternberg cells in an inflammatory background typical of Hodgkin lymphoma.\n    *   **EBV-positive T/NK-cell lymphomas**: Ruled out by the negative result for EBV-encoded RNA.\n\n**Conclusion**: The most accurate classification is Systemic Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma, ALK-negative, with *DUSP22* rearrangement.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Systemic Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL), ALK$-$, *DUSP22*-rearranged subtype; distinguished from Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma, Not Otherwise Specified (PTCL-NOS) by cohesive sheets of hallmark cells with uniform strong CD$30$, and from Primary Cutaneous ALCL by the absence of skin-limited disease; additionally differs from EBV-positive T/NK-cell lymphomas by EBV negativity and from ALK$+$ ALCL by ALK negativity.**\n*   **Diagnosis**: The diagnosis of Systemic ALCL, ALK$-$, *DUSP22*-rearranged subtype is correct, as derived above.\n*   **Distinctions**:\n    *   vs. PTCL-NOS: The distinction based on hallmark morphology and uniform strong CD$30$ is correct.\n    *   vs. Primary Cutaneous ALCL: The distinction based on the absence of skin-limited disease is correct.\n    *   vs. EBV+ lymphomas: The distinction based on EBV negativity is correct.\n    *   vs. ALK+ ALCL: The distinction based on ALK negativity is correct.\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**.

The morphology is also incorrect for Hodgkin lymphoma.\n*   **Distinctions**: The reasoning is flawed. *DUSP22* rearrangement is not characteristic of Hodgkin lymphoma. Strong CD$30$ expression is a shared feature, not a distinguishing one.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Primary Cutaneous Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma; distinguished from systemic ALCL by frequent DUSP$22$ rearrangement and cohesive growth, with systemic nodal disease being common in this cutaneous entity.**\n*   **Diagnosis**: This diagnosis is incorrect. The patient has systemic, not skin-limited, disease.\n*   **Distinctions**: The statement that systemic nodal disease is \"common\" in this cutaneous entity is misleading and undermines the primary definition of the disease. Cohesive growth is not a specific distinguishing feature between subtypes of ALCL.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Breast implant–associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma; distinguished by strong CD$30$ and ALK negativity together with DUSP$22$ rearrangement, regardless of implant history or anatomical site.**\n*   **Diagnosis**: This diagnosis is incorrect, as the patient has no history of breast implants.\n*   **Distinctions**: The reasoning contains multiple falsehoods. The diagnosis is not made \"regardless of implant history\" — the history is definitional. Furthermore, BIA-ALCL is characterized by the *absence* of *DUSP22* rearrangements.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4347621"}]}
