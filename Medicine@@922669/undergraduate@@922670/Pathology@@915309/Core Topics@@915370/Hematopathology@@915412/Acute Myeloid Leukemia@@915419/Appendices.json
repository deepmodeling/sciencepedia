In a standard differential count, the blast proportion is established by counting the number of morphologically identified blasts and dividing by the total number of nucleated cells. A commonly accepted diagnostic threshold is a blast fraction of at least 0.20 in the bone marrow. In a particular specimen, a total of $1500$ nucleated marrow cells are counted, of which $315$ are identified as blasts. Using the core definition of a proportion as the number in the category divided by the total number observed, compute the blast fraction for this specimen and, based on this value, determine whether the threshold for diagnosing acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is met.

The criterion of $\\ge 20\\%$ myeloblasts in a bone marrow or peripheral blood specimen is a cornerstone of AML diagnosis. The provided cell counts are realistic for a standard differential count.

From the problem statement, we have:\n$$N_{total} = 1500$$\n\nLet $N_{blasts}$ represent the number of cells identified as blasts within that count. The given value is:\n$$N_{blasts} = 315$$\n\nThe blast fraction, which we will denote as $f_{blasts}$, is defined as the ratio of the number of blasts to the total number of nucleated cells. The formula is:\n$$f_{blasts} = \\frac{N_{blasts}}{N_{total}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values into this formula, we can calculate the blast fraction for this specimen:\n$$f_{blasts} = \\frac{315}{1500}$$\n\nPerforming the division yields the exact decimal value:\n$$f_{blasts} = 0.21$$\n\nThe problem requires this result to be expressed as a decimal number rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is the $2$. The second is the $1$. To express this with four significant figures, we must add two trailing zeros.\n$$f_{blasts, rounded} = 0.2100$$\n\nThe problem also requires a determination of whether the diagnostic threshold for AML has been met. The threshold, $T_{AML}$, is given as a blast fraction of at least $0.20$.\n$$T_{AML} = 0.20$$\n\nTo determine if the criterion is met, we compare the calculated blast fraction to this threshold.\n$$f_{blasts} \\ge T_{AML}$$\n$$0.21 \\ge 0.20$$\n\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, based on the provided cell count, the diagnostic threshold for acute myeloid leukemia is met.\n\nThe final answer, as specified by the prompt, is the numerical value of the blast fraction rounded to four significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2100}$$", "id": "4317513"}, {"introduction": "Beyond diagnosis, managing a patient with AML involves vigilant monitoring for the life-threatening complications of treatment, particularly profound immunosuppression.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the calculation of the FLT3-ITD allelic ratio and the subsequent risk classification based on the 2022 ELN guidelines.\n\nThe fundamental principle stated is that the integrated peak area from capillary electrophoresis is proportional to the abundance of the corresponding DNA fragment. Let $A_{ITD}$ be the peak area for the FLT3-ITD mutant allele and $A_{WT}$ be the peak area for the FLT3 wild-type allele.\n\nThe given values are:\n$$ A_{ITD} = 1200 $$\n$$ A_{WT} = 3000 $$\n\nThe FLT3-ITD allelic ratio, denoted as $AR$, is defined as the ratio of the abundance of the ITD mutant allele to the abundance of the wild-type allele. Due to the stated proportionality, this ratio can be calculated directly from the respective peak areas:\n$$ AR = \\frac{\\text{Abundance of ITD allele}}{\\text{Abundance of WT allele}} = \\frac{k \\cdot A_{ITD}}{k \\cdot A_{WT}} = \\frac{A_{ITD}}{A_{WT}} $$\nwhere $k$ is the constant of proportionality, which cancels out.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$ AR = \\frac{1200}{3000} = \\frac{12}{30} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4 $$\n\nThe problem requires the allelic ratio to be reported as a dimensionless decimal rounded to four significant figures. Rounding $0.4$ to four significant figures gives $0.4000$.\n\nNext, we must classify the risk category according to the ELN 2022 guidelines, given the specific clinical context. The context provided is:\n$1$. Presence of a *FLT3*-ITD mutation.\n$2$. Normal karyotype.\n$3$. Wild-type *NPM1* status.\n\nThe ELN 2022 guidelines for AML risk stratification in patients with a normal karyotype use the *FLT3*-ITD allelic ratio as a key determinant. The critical threshold for this ratio is $0.5$. The specific rules relevant to this case are:\n- For patients with normal karyotype and wild-type *NPM1*:\n  - If the *FLT3*-ITD allelic ratio is $\\ge 0.5$, the risk category is **adverse**.\n  - If the *FLT3*-ITD allelic ratio is $ 0.5$, the risk category is **intermediate**.\n\nIn this case, the calculated allelic ratio is $AR = 0.4000$. We compare this value to the threshold:\n$$ 0.4000  0.5 $$\nSince the patient has a normal karyotype, is wild-type for *NPM1*, and the *FLT3*-ITD allelic ratio is less than $0.5$, the case is classified into the **intermediate risk** category according to the ELN 2022 guidelines.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of the allelic ratio as the final answer.\nThe calculated allelic ratio is precisely $0.4$.
