This equation describes the balance between hydrostatic and oncotic pressures, which drive fluid movement across a semipermeable membrane. The general form of the Starling equation is:\n$$J_{v} = K_{f} \\left[ (P_{c} - P_{i}) - \\sigma (\\pi_{c} - \\pi_{i}) \\right]$$\nwhere:\n- $J_{v}$ is the net fluid filtration rate (volume per unit time per unit tissue mass). A positive value indicates net filtration (movement out of the capillary into the interstitium), while a negative value indicates net absorption (movement into the capillary).\n- $K_{f}$ is the capillary filtration coefficient, which quantifies the intrinsic permeability of the capillary wall to water. Its units are $\\text{volume} \\cdot \\text{time}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{mass}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{pressure}^{-1}$.\n- $P_{c}$ is the capillary hydrostatic pressure, pushing fluid out of the capillary.\n- $P_{i}$ is the interstitial hydrostatic pressure, which can either push fluid into the capillary (if positive) or pull fluid out (if negative).\n- $\\sigma$ is the colloid reflection coefficient, a dimensionless factor that corrects the oncotic pressure gradient. It ranges from $0$ (freely permeable to solutes) to $1$ (completely impermeable to solutes). In Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), damage to the capillary barrier increases its permeability to proteins, thus lowering $\\sigma$.\n- $\\pi_{c}$ is the capillary oncotic pressure (or colloid osmotic pressure), generated by plasma proteins, which pulls fluid into the capillary.\n- $\\pi_{i}$ is the interstitial oncotic pressure, generated by proteins that have leaked into the interstitial space, which pulls fluid out of the capillary.\n\nThe term $(P_{c} - P_{i})$ represents the net hydrostatic pressure gradient, which favors filtration. The term $\\sigma (\\pi_{c} - \\pi_{i})$ represents the effective oncotic pressure gradient, which favors absorption.\n\nThe problem provides the following values for a patient with ARDS:\n- Capillary hydrostatic pressure, $P_{c} = 20\\,\\text{mmHg}$\n- Interstitial hydrostatic pressure, $P_{i} = -5\\,\\text{mmHg}$\n- Capillary oncotic pressure, $\\pi_{c} = 25\\,\\text{mmHg}$\n- Interstitial oncotic pressure, $\\pi_{i} = 5\\,\\text{mmHg}$\n- Capillary filtration coefficient, $K_{f} = 1\\,\\text{mL}\\cdot\\text{min}^{-1}\\cdot 100\\,\\text{g}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{mmHg}^{-1}$\n- Colloid reflection coefficient, $\\sigma = 0.3$\n\nFirst, we calculate the net hydrostatic pressure difference, $\\Delta P$:\n$$\\Delta P = P_{c} - P_{i} = 20\\,\\text{mmHg} - (-5\\,\\text{mmHg}) = 25\\,\\text{mmHg}$$\nThis positive pressure gradient strongly favors the movement of fluid out of the capillary into the surrounding lung tissue.\n\nNext, we calculate the net oncotic pressure difference, $\\Delta \\pi$:\n$$\\Delta \\pi = \\pi_{c} - \\pi_{i} = 25\\,\\text{mmHg} - 5\\,\\text{mmHg} = 20\\,\\text{mmHg}$$\nThis gradient would normally favor absorption. However, we must account for the leakiness of the membrane using the reflection coefficient, $\\sigma$.

The low value of $\\sigma$ ($0.3$) significantly diminishes the effectiveness of the oncotic pressure gradient in counteracting filtration, a key pathophysiological feature of ARDS.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values back into the Starling equation to find the net driving pressure, which is the term in the brackets:\n$$\\text{Net Driving Pressure} = (P_{c} - P_{i}) - \\sigma (\\pi_{c} - \\pi_{i}) = 25\\,\\text{mmHg} - 6\\,\\text{mmHg} = 19\\,\\text{mmHg}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the net volume flux, $J_{v}$, by multiplying the net driving pressure by the filtration coefficient, $K_{f}$:\n$$J_{v} = K_{f} \\times (\\text{Net Driving Pressure})$$\n$$J_{v} = (1\\,\\text{mL}\\cdot\\text{min}^{-1}\\cdot 100\\,\\text{g}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{mmHg}^{-1}) \\times (19\\,\\text{mmHg})$$\n$$J_{v} = 19\\,\\text{mL}\\cdot\\text{min}^{-1}\\cdot 100\\,\\text{g}^{-1}$$\nThe positive sign of $J_{v}$ confirms that there is a net movement of fluid out of the capillaries and into the pulmonary interstitium and alveoli, which is the mechanism of pulmonary edema formation in ARDS.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{19}$$", "id": "4318904"}, {"introduction": "Once edema fluid floods the alveoli, it inactivates pulmonary surfactant, a substance crucial for reducing surface tension at the air-liquid interface. This leads to alveolar instability and collapse (atelectasis), a key mechanical feature of ARDS.

At low lung volume, their radii are approximately $r_A = 100\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $r_B = 200\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$, respectively. In a healthy state at low lung volume, the effective surface tension is low due to surfactant, approximately $T_{\\text{normal}} \\approx 5\\ \\mathrm{mN/m}$, whereas in ARDS the effective surface tension is elevated toward near-aqueous values, approximately $T_{\\text{ARDS}} \\approx 25\\ \\mathrm{mN/m}$.

When two alveoli with the same $T$ are connected, gas preferentially flows from the larger to the smaller alveolus because the pressure is higher in the larger one, tending to equalize their radii over time.", "solution": "The core physical principle is Laplace's law for a spherical bubble, given as $P = 2T/r$. This equation dictates the minimum transmural pressure $P$ required to keep an alveolus of radius $r$ and surface tension $T$ from collapsing.

Since the applied pressure ($4\\ \\mathrm{cmH_2O}$) is less than $P_A$, alveolus A will remain collapsed.\n-   This differential ventilation, where some alveoli are open and others are collapsed, is a mechanism for regional collapse.

This means pressure $P$ is *inversely* proportional to radius $r$, i.e., $P \\propto 1/r$.\n-   The claim that $P \\propto r$ is a direct contradiction of Laplace's law. Because pressure is inversely proportional to radius, smaller alveoli require higher opening pressures and will open last, not first.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C Evaluation:**\nThis statement posits that increasing PEEP from $4\\ \\mathrm{cmH_2O}$ to $8\\ \\mathrm{cmH_2O}$ can recruit smaller alveoli.\n-   As established in the analysis of option A, at a PEEP of $4\\ \\mathrm{cmH_2O}$, the smaller alveolus A (with opening pressure $P_A \\approx 5.1\\ \\mathrm{cmH_2O}$) is collapsed.\n-   If the PEEP is increased to $8\\ \\mathrm{cmH_2O}$, the applied airway pressure is now greater than the opening pressure of alveolus A ($8\\ \\mathrm{cmH_2O} > 5.1\\ \\mathrm{cmH_2O}$).\n-   This higher pressure will force alveolus A to open. This process is known as \"recruitment\".\n-   Opening previously collapsed alveoli restores ventilation to that lung region, which reduces the amount of shunted blood and improves gas exchange. This is a primary goal of using PEEP in ARDS management. The statement is consistent with Laplace's law and therapeutic principles.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option D Evaluation:**\nThis statement claims that in ARDS, surfactant deficiency *decreases* $T$, leading to lower opening pressures and more stable alveoli.\n-   The function of pulmonary surfactant is to *reduce* surface tension. A deficiency of surfactant, as occurs in ARDS, therefore leads to an *increase* in surface tension $T$. The problem statement confirms this, giving $T_{\\text{ARDS}} \\approx 25\\ \\mathrm{mN/m}$ versus a normal value of $T_{\\text{normal}} \\approx 5\\ \\mathrm{mN/m}$.\n-   The statement's initial premise is factually incorrect. The consequences described (falling opening pressures, more stable alveoli) are also the opposite of what actually happens. Higher $T$ leads to higher opening pressures ($P \\propto T$) and greater instability.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option E Evaluation:**\nThis statement describes gas flow between two connected alveoli, claiming it flows from larger to smaller because pressure is higher in the larger one.\n-   According to Laplace's law, $P = 2T/r$. Pressure is inversely proportional to radius.\n-   Therefore, for a given surface tension $T$, the pressure inside the smaller alveolus (smaller $r$) is *higher* than the pressure inside the larger alveolus (larger $r$).\n-   Gas flows down a pressure gradient, from higher pressure to lower pressure.\n-   Consequently, gas would flow from the smaller, higher-pressure alveolus to the larger, lower-pressure alveolus. This leads to the collapse of the smaller unit and over-distension of the larger one, a phenomenon of instability. The statement's claim about both the pressure relationship and the direction of flow is incorrect.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "4318845"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate consequence of widespread alveolar collapse and fluid-filling is a severe failure of gas exchange.
