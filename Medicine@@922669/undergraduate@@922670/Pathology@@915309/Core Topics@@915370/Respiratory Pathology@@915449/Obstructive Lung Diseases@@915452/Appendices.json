Chronic bronchitis is clinically defined by productive cough due to mucus hypersecretion.

The data are consistent and realistic for the described clinical scenario. We can therefore proceed with a rigorous solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the alveolar–arterial oxygen gradient ($A$–$a$ gradient) and a subsequent interpretation of its clinical significance. The first step is to determine the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen ($P_{A\\mathrm{O_2}}$). This is achieved using the alveolar gas equation, which is derived from the principles of mass balance for oxygen in the alveoli. The equation relates the alveolar oxygen pressure to the inspired oxygen pressure and the rate of carbon dioxide excretion.\n\nThe alveolar gas equation is stated as:\n$$P_{A\\text{O}_2} = P_{\\text{I}\\text{O}_2} - \\frac{P_{A\\text{CO}_2}}{R}$$\nwhere $P_{\\text{I}\\text{O}_2}$ is the partial pressure of inspired oxygen, $P_{A\\text{CO}_2}$ is the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and $R$ is the respiratory quotient (the ratio of $\\text{CO}_2$ produced to $\\text{O}_2$ consumed).\n\nThe partial pressure of inspired oxygen, $P_{\\text{I}\\text{O}_2}$, is the fraction of inspired oxygen ($F_{\\text{I}\\text{O}_2}$) multiplied by the total dry gas pressure. The total gas pressure available is the barometric pressure ($P_B$) minus the partial pressure of water vapor ($P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$), as the inspired air becomes fully saturated with water vapor in the upper airways.\n$$P_{\\text{I}\\text{O}_2} = F_{\\text{I}\\text{O}_2} \\times (P_B - P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}})$$\nSubstituting this into the alveolar gas equation gives the clinically used form:\n$$P_{A\\text{O}_2} = \\left[ F_{\\text{I}\\text{O}_2} \\times (P_B - P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}) \\right] - \\frac{P_{A\\text{CO}_2}}{R}$$\nIn clinical practice, it is a standard and valid approximation to assume that the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide ($P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$) is equal to the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide ($P_{A\\text{CO}_2}$), because $\\text{CO}_2$ is a highly diffusible gas and equilibrates rapidly across the alveolar-capillary membrane. The problem provides $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$, so we will use this value for $P_{A\\text{CO}_2}$.\n\nThe given values are:\n- $F_{\\text{I}\\text{O}_2} = 0.21$\n- $P_B = 760\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- $P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}} = 47\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- $P_{a\\text{CO}_2} = 60\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ (used as $P_{A\\text{CO}_2}$)\n- $R = 0.8$\n\nWe now substitute these values into the alveolar gas equation to calculate $P_{A\\text{O}_2}$:\n$$P_{A\\text{O}_2} = \\left[ 0.21 \\times (760 - 47) \\right] - \\frac{60}{0.8}$$\n$$P_{A\\text{O}_2} = \\left[ 0.21 \\times 713 \\right] - 75$$\n$$P_{A\\text{O}_2} = 149.73 - 75$$\n$$P_{A\\text{O}_2} = 74.73\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$$\n\nNext, we compute the alveolar–arterial oxygen gradient ($A$–$a$ gradient), which is defined as the difference between the alveolar and arterial partial pressures of oxygen:\n$$A\\text{–}a \\text{ gradient} = P_{A\\text{O}_2} - P_{a\\text{O}_2}$$\nThe problem provides the arterial oxygen partial pressure, $P_{a\\text{O}_2} = 55\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$.

The $A$–$a$ gradient is a crucial tool for this purpose. It quantifies the efficiency of gas exchange across the alveolar-capillary membrane.\n\n1.  **Pure Alveolar Hypoventilation**: In this condition, the reduction in overall ventilation leads to an increase in systemic $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$ and a corresponding decrease in $P_{A\\text{O}_2}$ (as shown by the alveolar gas equation). Since less oxygen is available in the alveoli, the $P_{a\\text{O}_2}$ will also decrease. However, if the lungs are otherwise healthy and gas exchange is efficient, the oxygen that is present in the alveoli will still diffuse normally into the blood. Therefore, the difference between $P_{A\\text{O}_2}$ and $P_{a\\text{O}_2}$ remains small. A key characteristic of pure hypoventilation is a **normal $A$–$a$ gradient**.\n\n2.  **Ventilation–Perfusion (V/Q) Mismatch**: This is a state where some regions of the lung are ventilated but poorly perfused, or perfused but poorly ventilated. Blood leaving poorly ventilated alveoli has a low oxygen content, and when mixed with blood from well-ventilated alveoli, it lowers the overall systemic $P_{a\\text{O}_2}$. This creates a significant drop in $P_{a\\text{O}_2}$ relative to the *average* $P_{A\\text{O}_2}$ of the lung. A key characteristic of V/Q mismatch is an **elevated $A$–$a$ gradient**.\n\nThe normal $A$–$a$ gradient increases with age. A common estimation for the expected normal gradient in a healthy, air-breathing individual is given by the formula:\n$$\\text{Expected } A\\text{–}a \\text{ gradient} \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\text{Age in years}}{4}\\right) + 4$$\nFor the $65$-year-old patient:\n$$\\text{Expected } A\\text{–}a \\text{ gradient} \\approx \\left(\\frac{65}{4}\\right) + 4 = 16.25 + 4 = 20.25\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$$\nOur calculated $A$–$a$ gradient is $19.7\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, which is very close to the expected normal value for this patient's age. The patient presents with significant hypoxemia ($P_{a\\text{O}_2} = 55\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$) and severe hypercapnia ($P_{a\\text{CO}_2} = 60\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$). The severe hypercapnia is definitive evidence of significant alveolar hypoventilation. The fact that the $A$–$a$ gradient is normal indicates that this hypoventilation is the predominant cause of the patient's hypoxemia. While a patient with longstanding COPD intrinsically has V/Q mismatch, the normal $A$–$a$ gradient in this specific presentation demonstrates that the hypoxemia is almost entirely accounted for by the hypoventilation, not by a superimposed, severe V/Q-mismatch-driven process. If a significant V/Q mismatch were the primary driver of the hypoxemia, the $A$–$a$ gradient would be substantially elevated above the age-predicted normal value.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{19.7}\n$$", "id": "4972462"}]}
