Many bacteria achieve this using quorum sensing, a communication system that links gene expression to population density. This practice asks you to build a mathematical model of quorum sensing dynamics, accounting for signal production, natural decay, and enzymatic degradation (quorum quenching) [@problem_id:4402730]. By analyzing the steady state of this system, you can determine the precise amount of a quenching enzyme needed to keep the virulence signal below its activation threshold, illustrating how quantitative models can guide the design of anti-virulence therapies.", "problem": "A Gram-negative pathogen uses Quorum Sensing (QS) to regulate toxin gene expression in response to the concentration of an acyl-homoserine lactone signal molecule. Let the signal concentration be denoted by $A(t)$ in a well-mixed culture at constant cell density. Assume that cells synthesize signal at a constant volumetric rate $p$ (units: concentration per time), the signal undergoes natural first-order decay with rate constant $k_{d}$ (units: time$^{-1}$), and a constitutively supplied quorum-quenching enzyme degrades the signal according to Michaelis-Menten (MM) kinetics with catalytic rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ (units: time$^{-1}$) and Michaelis constant $K_{M}$ (units: concentration). The total enzyme concentration is $E$ (units: concentration). The activation threshold for QS-controlled toxin transcription occurs at signal concentration $A_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\n\nFrom first principles of mass balance and the stated kinetic assumptions, determine the minimal enzyme concentration $E_{\\min}$ that ensures the steady-state signal concentration does not exceed the activation threshold, that is, $A^{\\ast} \\leq A_{\\mathrm{th}}$ at steady state.

Your qualitative prediction does not require a numerical answer.", "solution": "The problem asks for the minimal enzyme concentration $E_{\\min}$ required to keep the steady-state concentration of a quorum sensing signal molecule, $A^*$, at or below a specific activation threshold, $A_{\\mathrm{th}}$. It also asks for a qualitative prediction of the effect on toxin production.\n\nFirst, we must formulate a mass balance equation for the signal molecule concentration, $A(t)$. The rate of change of $A$, denoted by $\\frac{dA}{dt}$, is the sum of its rate of production and the rates of its removal. The problem specifies three processes:\n1.  A constant synthesis rate, $+p$.\n2.  A first-order natural decay, with a rate of $-k_d A$.\n3.  An enzymatic degradation following Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with a rate of $-V$. The velocity $V$ is given by the Michaelis-Menten equation, $V = \\frac{V_{\\max} A}{K_M + A}$, where the maximum velocity $V_{\\max}$ is directly proportional to the total enzyme concentration $E$ via the catalytic rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$, such that $V_{\\max} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} E$.\n\nCombining these terms, we construct the ordinary differential equation (ODE) governing the signal concentration $A(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = p - k_d A - \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} E A}{K_M + A}\n$$\n\nAt steady state, the concentration of the signal molecule is constant, which means its rate of change is zero. Let $A^*$ be the steady-state concentration. Setting $\\frac{dA}{dt} = 0$:\n$$\n0 = p - k_d A^* - \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} E A^*}{K_M + A^*}\n$$\n\nOur goal is to find the enzyme concentration $E$ that results in a given steady-state concentration $A^*$. We can rearrange the steady-state equation to solve for $E$:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} E A^*}{K_M + A^*} = p - k_d A^*\n$$\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{cat}} E A^* = (p - k_d A^*)(K_M + A^*)\n$$\nAssuming $A^* \\neq 0$, we can divide by $k_{\\mathrm{cat}} A^*$:\n$$\nE = \\frac{(p - k_d A^*)(K_M + A^*)}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} A^*}\n$$\nThis equation provides the required enzyme concentration $E$ to maintain a specific steady-state signal level $A^*$.\n\nThe problem requires that the steady-state concentration does not exceed the activation threshold, i.e., $A^* \\leq A_{\\mathrm{th}}$. The minimal enzyme concentration, $E_{\\min}$, is the concentration required to hold the steady-state level exactly at the threshold, $A^* = A_{\\mathrm{th}}$. If the enzyme concentration were any lower, the degradation rate would be insufficient, and the steady-state signal concentration would rise above $A_{\\mathrm{th}}$. Any higher enzyme concentration would further reduce the signal level, also satisfying the condition. Thus, we find $E_{\\min}$ by substituting $A^* = A_{\\mathrm{th}}$ into our expression for $E$:\n$$\nE_{\\min} = \\frac{(p - k_d A_{\\mathrm{th}})(K_M + A_{\\mathrm{th}})}{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} A_{\\mathrm{th}}}\n$$\nThis expression is physically meaningful only if the term $(p - k_d A_{\\mathrm{th}})$ is positive, which implies that natural decay alone is insufficient to keep the signal level below the threshold, necessitating enzymatic action. Using the given values, $p - k_d A_{\\mathrm{th}} = 0.5 - (0.2)(1.0) = 0.3 > 0$, so the use of the enzyme is necessary.\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into the expression for $E_{\\min}$:\n- $p = 0.5$ micromolar/hour\n- $k_d = 0.2$ hour$^{-1}$\n- $k_{\\mathrm{cat}} = 10$ hour$^{-1}$\n- $K_M = 0.2$ micromolar\n- $A_{\\mathrm{th}} = 1.0$ micromolar\n\n$$\nE_{\\min} = \\frac{(0.5 - 0.2 \\times 1.0)(0.2 + 1.0)}{10 \\times 1.0}\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\min} = \\frac{(0.3)(1.2)}{10}\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\min} = \\frac{0.36}{10} = 0.036\n$$\nThe units of the expression are $\\frac{(\\text{conc}/\\text{time}) \\times \\text{conc}}{(\\text{time}^{-1}) \\times \\text{conc}} = \\text{conc}$. With the given parameters, the unit is micromolar ($\\mu$M). So, $E_{\\min} = 0.036$ $\\mu$M. Rounding to three significant figures gives $0.0360$ $\\mu$M.\n\nFor the second part of the question, we must qualitatively predict the effect of this quorum quenching on toxin production. In the absence of the quenching enzyme ($E=0$), the steady-state signal concentration, which we can call $A^*_{nq}$, would be determined solely by the balance between synthesis and natural decay:\n$$\np - k_d A^*_{nq} = 0 \\implies A^*_{nq} = \\frac{p}{k_d}\n$$\nUsing the given values:\n$$\nA^*_{nq} = \\frac{0.5 \\text{ micromolar/hour}}{0.2 \\text{ hour}^{-1}} = 2.5 \\text{ micromolar}\n$$\nThe threshold for activation of toxin transcription is $A_{\\mathrm{th}} = 1.0$ micromolar. Since $A^*_{nq} = 2.5$ micromolar is greater than $A_{\\mathrm{th}}$, the pathogen population would naturally reach a signal concentration sufficient to activate toxin gene expression in the non-quenched case. By introducing the quorum-quenching enzyme at a concentration $E \\geq E_{\\min}$, the system is engineered to maintain a steady-state signal level $A^* \\leq A_{\\mathrm{th}}$. Consequently, the condition for transcriptional activation is never met. Therefore, maintaining $A^* \\leq A_{\\mathrm{th}}$ would suppress or prevent the activation of toxin gene expression, keeping toxin production at a basal or uninduced level, in stark contrast to the robust toxin production expected in the non-quenched scenario.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0360}$$", "id": "4402730"}, {"introduction": "Once inside a host cell, some pathogens, like *Listeria monocytogenes*, must move and spread to adjacent cells.

All necessary constants, variables, and relationships are provided, allowing for the derivation of a unique, closed-form solution.\n\nThe derivation of the steady propulsion velocity, $v$, proceeds as follows.\n\nFirst, the problem defines the barbed-end polymerization event rate per filament in the absence of an external load ($f=0$). This unloaded rate, $r_{0}$, is given by:\n$$r_{0} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,c$$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is the second-order on-rate constant for monomer addition and $c$ is the concentration of free ATP-actin monomers.\n\nNext, we consider the effect of an opposing compressive force $f$ on a single filament.
