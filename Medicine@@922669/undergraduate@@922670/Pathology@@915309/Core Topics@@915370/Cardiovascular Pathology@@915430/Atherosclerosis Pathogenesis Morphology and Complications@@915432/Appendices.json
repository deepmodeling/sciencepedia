A central regulator of hepatic LDL clearance is the Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor (LDLR), whose surface density is reduced by Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9) through receptor targeting to lysosomal degradation. Consider a hepatocyte surface receptor pool with turnover governed by a production rate $r_{s}$ (receptors per cell per day) and two first-order loss processes: constitutive endocytosis with effective net loss rate constant $k_{c}$ (day$^{-1}$), and PCSK9-mediated degradation with rate constant $k_{p}$ (day$^{-1}$). Assume a single-compartment plasma LDL model in which the LDL concentration $C(t)$ (mg/dL) obeys mass balance with an input flux $J$ (mg/dL per day) and a hepatic clearance term proportional to both the LDLR surface density $R(t)$ (receptors per cell) and $C(t)$, with proportionality constant $k_{u}$ (day$^{-1}$ per receptor per cell).\n\nStarting from the receptor turnover equation $dR/dt = r_{s} - (k_{c} + k_{p})\\,R$ and the plasma LDL mass balance $dC/dt = J - k_{u}\\,R\\,C$, derive the steady-state LDLR surface density and the steady-state LDL concentration. Then, predict the change in steady-state LDL concentration when PCSK9 loss-of-function decreases the degradation rate constant from a baseline $k_{p}$ to a mutated value $k_{p}'$, under the assumption that $r_{s}$, $k_{c}$, $J$, and $k_{u}$ remain unchanged.\n\nUse the following scientifically plausible parameter values:\n- Receptor production rate $r_{s} = 1000$ receptors per cell per day.\n- Constitutive endocytosis net loss rate $k_{c} = 0.40$ day$^{-1}$.\n- Baseline PCSK9-mediated degradation rate $k_{p} = 0.30$ day$^{-1}$.\n- Loss-of-function PCSK9-mediated degradation rate $k_{p}' = 0.05$ day$^{-1}$.\n- Baseline steady-state plasma LDL concentration $C_{0} = 130$ mg/dL.\n\nAssume the unsaturated, first-order clearance regime holds so that the proportionality constant $k_{u}$ and the input flux $J$ do not change between baseline and the loss-of-function state.

The roles of LDLR, PCSK9, endocytosis, and hepatic clearance are central and well-established concepts in the pathology of atherosclerosis. The use of first-order kinetics and a single-compartment model is a standard and acceptable simplification for creating a tractable mathematical representation of a complex biological system. The provided parameters are explicitly stated to be \"scientifically plausible.\"\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a system of two ordinary differential equations and asks for the steady-state solutions. It provides sufficient parameter values and relationships to determine the requested quantities. The unknown parameters $J$ and $k_u$ can be handled as a constant ratio, which is determined by the baseline condition, making the problem solvable for the new concentration. The solution is unique and stable.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is phrased in precise, technical language, free from subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formally specified, complete, and well-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution is warranted.\n\nThe dynamics of the LDLR surface density, $R(t)$, and the plasma LDL concentration, $C(t)$, are governed by the following system of coupled ordinary differential equations:\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = r_{s} - (k_{c} + k_{p})R $$\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = J - k_{u}RC $$\n\nFirst, we derive the general expressions for the steady-state LDLR surface density, denoted $R_{ss}$, and the steady-state LDL concentration, $C_{ss}$. The steady state is defined by the condition where the rates of change are zero, i.e., $dR/dt = 0$ and $dC/dt = 0$.\n\nSetting the first equation to zero gives:\n$$ 0 = r_{s} - (k_{c} + k_{p})R_{ss} $$\nSolving for $R_{ss}$, we obtain the steady-state LDLR surface density:\n$$ R_{ss} = \\frac{r_{s}}{k_{c} + k_{p}} $$\n\nSetting the second equation to zero gives:\n$$ 0 = J - k_{u}R_{ss}C_{ss} $$\nSolving for $C_{ss}$ and substituting the expression for $R_{ss}$:\n$$ C_{ss} = \\frac{J}{k_{u}R_{ss}} = \\frac{J}{k_{u}} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\frac{r_{s}}{k_{c} + k_{p}}} \\right) $$\n$$ C_{ss} = \\frac{J(k_{c} + k_{p})}{k_{u}r_{s}} $$\nThese are the general expressions for the steady-state values.\n\nNext, we analyze the two specific conditions: the baseline state and the PCSK9 loss-of-function state. Let the subscript $0$ denote the baseline state and subscript $1$ denote the loss-of-function state.\n\nIn the baseline state, the PCSK9 degradation rate constant is $k_{p}$. The steady-state LDL concentration is given as $C_{0}$. Using the derived formula:\n$$ C_{0} = \\frac{J(k_{c} + k_{p})}{k_{u}r_{s}} $$\n\nIn the loss-of-function state, the PCSK9 degradation rate constant is reduced to $k_{p}'$. The problem states that $r_{s}$, $k_{c}$, $J$, and $k_{u}$ remain unchanged. The new steady-state LDL concentration, $C_{1}$, is:\n$$ C_{1} = \\frac{J(k_{c} + k_{p}')}{k_{u}r_{s}} $$\n\nTo find the change in steady-state LDL concentration, we can compute the ratio $C_{1}/C_{0}$. This approach conveniently cancels the unknown parameters $J$, $k_{u}$, and the given parameter $r_s$.\n$$ \\frac{C_{1}}{C_{0}} = \\frac{\\frac{J(k_{c} + k_{p}')}{k_{u}r_{s}}}{\\frac{J(k_{c} + k_{p})}{k_{u}r_{s}}} = \\frac{k_{c} + k_{p}'}{k_{c} + k_{p}} $$\n\nWe can now solve for the new concentration $C_{1}$:\n$$ C_{1} = C_{0} \\left( \\frac{k_{c} + k_{p}'}{k_{c} + k_{p}} \\right) $$\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this expression:\n-   $C_{0} = 130$ mg/dL\n-   $k_{c} = 0.40$ day$^{-1}$\n-   $k_{p} = 0.30$ day$^{-1}$\n-   $k_{p}' = 0.05$ day$^{-1}$\n\n$$ C_{1} = 130 \\left( \\frac{0.40 + 0.05}{0.40 + 0.30} \\right) $$\n$$ C_{1} = 130 \\left( \\frac{0.45}{0.70} \\right) $$\n$$ C_{1} = 130 \\left( \\frac{45}{70} \\right) = 130 \\left( \\frac{9}{14} \\right) $$\n$$ C_{1} = \\frac{1170}{14} = \\frac{585}{7} $$\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ C_{1} \\approx 83.5714... \\text{ mg/dL} $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to three significant figures.\n$$ C_{1} \\approx 83.6 \\text{ mg/dL} $$\n\nThe physical interpretation is that a loss of function in PCSK9 (a smaller $k_{p}'$) reduces the degradation rate of LDLR. This leads to a higher steady-state surface density of LDLR ($R_1  R_0$), which in turn increases the clearance of LDL from the plasma, resulting in a lower steady-state LDL concentration ($C_1  C_0$).

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe fundamental relationship for steady, laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid through a rigid cylindrical tube of length $L$ and radius $r$ is given by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. This equation relates the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, to the pressure drop along the tube, $\\Delta P$, the fluid's dynamic viscosity, $\\mu$, and the tube's geometry. The equation is:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}\n$$\nThis equation establishes the requested dependence of $Q$ on $r$ and $\\Delta P$. The flow rate is directly proportional to the pressure drop, $Q \\propto \\Delta P$, and strongly dependent on the radius, being proportional to the fourth power of the radius, $Q \\propto r^4$.\n\nWe can apply this general relationship to the two specified conditions: the initial (healthy) state and the final (diseased) state.\n\nFor the initial state, denoted by subscript $0$:\n$$\nQ_0 = \\frac{\\pi r_0^4 \\Delta P_0}{8 \\mu L}\n$$\n\nFor the final state, denoted by subscript $1$:\n$$\nQ_1 = \\frac{\\pi r_1^4 \\Delta P_1}{8 \\mu L}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires us to find the factor $F = \\Delta P_1 / \\Delta P_0$ that is necessary to maintain the same volumetric flow rate. This imposes the constraint $Q_1 = Q_0$. Therefore, we can set the two expressions for flow equal to each other:\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi r_0^4 \\Delta P_0}{8 \\mu L} = \\frac{\\pi r_1^4 \\Delta P_1}{8 \\mu L}\n$$\n\nThe constant terms $\\frac{\\pi}{8 \\mu L}$ are present on both sides of the equation and can be cancelled. This simplification yields:\n$$\nr_0^4 \\Delta P_0 = r_1^4 \\Delta P_1\n$$\n\nWe are asked to compute the ratio $F = \\Delta P_1 / \\Delta P_0$. Rearranging the equation to solve for this ratio gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta P_1}{\\Delta P_0} = \\frac{r_0^4}{r_1^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_0}{r_1}\\right)^4\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the plaque narrows the lumen such that the new radius is half the original radius, $r_1 = 0.5\\,r_0$, or $r_1 = \\frac{1}{2}r_0$. Substituting this relationship into our expression for the pressure drop ratio:\n$$\nF = \\frac{\\Delta P_1}{\\Delta P_0} = \\left(\\frac{r_0}{\\frac{1}{2}r_0}\\right)^4\n$$\n\nSimplifying the term inside the parentheses:\n$$\nF = (2)^4\n$$\n\nCalculating the final numerical value:\n$$\nF = 16\n$$\n\nThis result indicates that to maintain the same blood flow through an artery whose radius has been halved, the pressure drop across the stenotic segment must increase by a factor of $16$.\n\nRegarding the clinical significance: A $16$-fold increase in the pressure gradient required to perfuse a tissue bed is physiologically extreme and generally unsustainable. The circulatory system has limited capacity to increase upstream arterial pressure (mean arterial pressure). Such a dramatic demand for increased pressure to overcome the heightened resistance means that, in practice, the flow rate $Q_1$ will not be maintained equal to $Q_0$. Instead, the flow will decrease substantially. A stenosis of this magnitude ($50\\%$ reduction in radius, which corresponds to a $75\\%$ reduction in cross-sectional area) is considered a \"critical stenosis\" because it significantly compromises blood flow even when the tissue is at rest, leading to a high risk of ischemia (tissue dysfunction or damage due to inadequate blood supply). Under conditions of increased demand (e.g., exercise), the mismatch between supply and demand would be even more severe, likely precipitating symptoms such as angina pectoris if the coronary arteries are affected.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{16}\n$$", "id": "4329895"}, {"introduction": "The most devastating clinical events in atherosclerosis, such as heart attack and stroke, are often triggered by the mechanical rupture of a \"vulnerable\" plaque.
