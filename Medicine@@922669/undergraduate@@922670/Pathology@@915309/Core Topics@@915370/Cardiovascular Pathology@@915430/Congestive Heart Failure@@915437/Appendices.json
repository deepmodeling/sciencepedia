The assumption of no significant valvular regurgitation is a standard and necessary condition for this type of calculation, making the problem consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically sound exercise in applying fundamental physiological principles. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\n**1. Definitions of Cardiac Metrics**\nWe begin by defining the requested quantities in words and then formalizing them mathematically based on the principle of volumetric flow, $Q=\\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta t}$.\n\n-   **Stroke Volume ($SV$)**:\n    -   *In words*: Stroke volume is the volume of blood pumped from a single ventricle of the heart during one contraction (one beat).\n    -   *Mathematical expression*: It represents a discrete change in volume, $\\Delta V$, over the course of a single beat. Let $\\Delta V_{\\text{beat}}$ be this volume. Thus,\n    $$SV = \\Delta V_{\\text{beat}}$$\n\n-   **Cardiac Output ($CO$)**:\n    -   *In words*: Cardiac output is the total volume of blood pumped by a ventricle per unit time (typically per minute). It is a measure of the overall pump performance over time.\n    -   *Mathematical expression*: This is a volumetric flow rate, $Q$. If one beat ejects a volume $SV$ and occurs over a time period $T$ (the cardiac cycle length), the average flow rate is $\\frac{SV}{T}$. Letting the heart rate, $HR$, be the number of beats per unit time ($HR = 1/T$), we can express the cardiac output as:\n    $$CO = SV \\times HR$$\n\n-   **Ejection Fraction ($EF$)**:\n    -   *In words*: Ejection fraction is the fraction (or percentage) of blood from the filled ventricle that is ejected during one contraction. It is a normalized measure of pump efficiency for a single beat.\n    -   *Mathematical expression*: It is a dimensionless ratio of the volume ejected to the initial volume from which it was ejected. The volume ejected is the stroke volume, $SV$. The initial volume, corresponding to the maximum filled state of the ventricle before contraction, is the end-diastolic volume, $EDV$. Therefore,\n    $$EF = \\frac{\\text{Volume Ejected}}{\\text{Initial Volume}} = \\frac{SV}{EDV}$$\n\n**2. Assumption of No Significant Valvular Regurgitation**\nWe explicitly state and use the assumption that there is no significant valvular regurgitation (e.g., aortic or mitral insufficiency). This ensures that the change in the ventricle's volume during contraction corresponds directly and entirely to the volume of blood pushed forward into the circulatory system (forward flow). Without this assumption, the measured change in ventricular volume would be the sum of forward flow and regurgitant (backward) flow, and $SV$ calculated from volume changes would not represent the effective stroke volume.\n\n**3. Derivation of $SV$ and $EF$**\nUsing the principle of conservation of volume within the ventricular chamber for a single cardiac cycle:\n-   The volume of blood in the ventricle is at its maximum at the end of diastole (filling). This is the End-Diastolic Volume, $EDV$.\n-   The ventricle then contracts (systole), ejecting blood. The volume of blood remaining in the ventricle at the end of this contraction is at its minimum. This is the End-Systolic Volume, $ESV$.\n-   The volume of blood that was ejected, which is by definition the Stroke Volume ($SV$), must be the difference between the initial maximum volume and the final minimum volume.\nTherefore, we derive the expression for $SV$ as:\n$$SV = EDV - ESV$$\nNow, we use this result to express the Ejection Fraction ($EF$). From its definition in part 1, $EF$ is the ratio of the stroke volume to the end-diastolic volume. Substituting our derived expression for $SV$:\n$$EF = \\frac{SV}{EDV} = \\frac{EDV - ESV}{EDV}$$\nThis completes the required derivations based on the given principles.\n\n**4. Calculation of $EF$ for the Patient**\nWe are given the following values for a patient:\n-   $EDV = 150~\\text{mL}$\n-   $ESV = 90~\\text{mL}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the stroke volume, $SV$, using the derived formula:\n$$SV = EDV - ESV = 150~\\text{mL} - 90~\\text{mL} = 60~\\text{mL}$$\nNext, we use this $SV$ and the given $EDV$ to calculate the ejection fraction, $EF$:\n$$EF = \\frac{SV}{EDV} = \\frac{60~\\text{mL}}{150~\\text{mL}}$$\nThe units cancel, as expected, yielding a dimensionless quantity.\n$$EF = \\frac{60}{150} = \\frac{6}{15} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.\n$$EF = 0.400$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.400}$$", "id": "4350311"}, {"introduction": "The heart is not a static organ; it remodels itself in response to chronic stress, a central theme in the pathology of heart failure.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of mechanical equilibrium and cardiac pathophysiology, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and stated objectively.\n\nThe problem requires three parts: first, a derivation of the relationship for circumferential wall stress in a thin-walled sphere; second, a numerical calculation of this stress given specific parameters; and third, a pathophysiological explanation based on the derived relationship.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Wall Stress ($\\sigma$)**\n\nWe model the left ventricle (LV) as a thin-walled sphere with an internal radius $r$ and a wall thickness $h$. The model is based on the mechanical equilibrium of forces acting on a hemisphere of this sphere at end-systole.\n\nThe internal transmural pressure $P$ exerts a force, $F_P$, that tends to separate the two halves of the sphere. This force acts on the circular cross-sectional area of the fluid at the plane of bisection. The area of this circle is $A_P = \\pi r^2$.\nThe force $F_P$ is therefore given by:\n$$ F_P = P \\cdot A_P = P \\pi r^2 $$\n\nThis bursting force is counteracted by the circumferential stress, $\\sigma$, within the material of the wall. This stress acts over the cross-sectional area of the wall itself, which is an annulus (a ring). For a thin-walled sphere, where the thickness $h$ is much smaller than the radius $r$ (i.e., $h \\ll r$), the cross-sectional area of the wall, $A_{\\text{wall}}$, can be approximated as the circumference of the sphere multiplied by the wall thickness.\nThe circumference is $2\\pi r$. Thus, the area of the wall is:\n$$ A_{\\text{wall}} \\approx (2\\pi r) h $$\n\nThe total tensile force, $F_{\\sigma}$, within the wall material that resists the pressure-induced separation is the product of the circumferential stress $\\sigma$ and this wall area:\n$$ F_{\\sigma} = \\sigma \\cdot A_{\\text{wall}} = \\sigma (2\\pi rh) $$\n\nFor the ventricle to be in mechanical equilibrium, the force due to pressure must be exactly balanced by the resistive force from the wall stress:\n$$ F_P = F_{\\sigma} $$\n$$ P \\pi r^2 = \\sigma (2\\pi rh) $$\n\nTo find the expression for the circumferential wall stress $\\sigma$, we solve this equation for $\\sigma$:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{P \\pi r^2}{2\\pi rh} $$\nBy canceling common terms ($\\pi$ and one factor of $r$), we arrive at the Law of Laplace for a spherical vessel:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{Pr}{2h} $$\nThis expression connects the circumferential wall stress $\\sigma$ to the chamber pressure $P$, chamber radius $r$, and wall thickness $h$.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation of LV Wall Stress**\n\nWe are given the following values and constants:\nChamber pressure, $P = 120\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\nChamber radius, $r = 3\\ \\mathrm{cm}$\nWall thickness, $h = 1\\ \\mathrm{cm}$\nConversion factor for pressure: $1\\ \\mathrm{mmHg} = 133.322\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\nConversion factor for kilopascals: $1\\ \\mathrm{kPa} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n\nFirst, we convert all parameters to a consistent set of SI units (meters, Pascals).\nThe pressure $P$ in Pascals is:\n$P = 120\\ \\mathrm{mmHg} \\times \\frac{133.322\\ \\mathrm{Pa}}{1\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}} = 15998.64\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n\nThe radius $r$ in meters is:\n$r = 3\\ \\mathrm{cm} \\times \\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{m}}{100\\ \\mathrm{cm}} = 0.03\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nThe thickness $h$ in meters is:\n$h = 1\\ \\mathrm{cm} \\times \\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{m}}{100\\ \\mathrm{cm}} = 0.01\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the derived formula for stress $\\sigma$:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{Pr}{2h} = \\frac{(15998.64\\ \\mathrm{Pa}) \\times (0.03\\ \\mathrm{m})}{2 \\times (0.01\\ \\mathrm{m})} $$\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{479.9592\\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot m}}{0.02\\ \\mathrm{m}} $$\n$$ \\sigma = 23997.96\\ \\mathrm{Pa} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer in kilopascals (kPa).

Myocardial oxygen demand ($MVO_2$), a measure of the metabolic work performed by the heart muscle, is directly proportional to the myocardial wall stress, $\\sigma$.\n\nIn conditions of chronic pressure overload, such as systemic arterial hypertension, the left ventricle must consistently generate a higher pressure $P$ to eject blood into the aorta. According to the formula, if $P$ increases while $r$ and $h$ remain constant, the wall stress $\\sigma$ will increase. This elevated stress signifies increased mechanical load on the heart muscle, leading to a higher $MVO_2$.\n\nConcentric hypertrophy is a compensatory mechanism in which the heart muscle responds to this chronic pressure overload. The term \"concentric\" signifies that the ventricular wall thickness, $h$, increases, often without a significant increase in the chamber radius, $r$. This results in an increased ratio of wall thickness to chamber radius ($h/r$).\n\nBy examining the derived equation, $\\sigma = \\frac{P}{2(h/r)}$, we can see the effect of this adaptation. By increasing the wall thickness $h$ for a given radius $r$, the heart muscle effectively reduces the wall stress $\\sigma$ required to sustain the elevated pressure $P$. This normalization of wall stress, despite the high intracavitary pressure, serves to reduce the myocardial oxygen demand ($MVO_2$) back toward a more normal level. This physiological adaptation is crucial for maintaining cardiac function in the face of sustained hypertension, although if the underlying cause is not addressed, this remodeling process can become maladaptive and contribute to diastolic dysfunction and eventual heart failure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{24.00}$$", "id": "4350302"}, {"introduction": "A clinician's role is to synthesize diverse data into a coherent diagnosis, and in heart failure, echocardiography is a primary tool for this.
