The appropriate fundamental base is the mechanical equilibrium of a thin-walled spherical pressure vessel, which can be derived from first principles by balancing forces across a hemispherical cut.\n\nConsider a spherical chamber of internal radius $r$, wall thickness $h$, and internal pressure $P$. Take a hemispherical section and examine equilibrium at the equator.
