This exercise explores the crucial relationship between the number of biopsy samples taken and the probability of successfully diagnosing the disease.

Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) samples are taken from different right ventricular sites to increase the chance of capturing a diagnostic focus. Suppose each EMB sample independently has probability $p = 0.2$ of containing histologically diagnostic myocarditis. Assume independence between samples due to spatial separation and random site selection. Using only the complement rule from probability theory and properties of independent Bernoulli trials, derive the general expression for the probability that at least one of $n$ independent samples is diagnostic. Then, determine the smallest integer number of samples $n$ required such that the overall probability of detecting myocarditis is at least $0.95$.

No units are required.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It presents a standard application of probability theory to a realistic problem in medical diagnostics without any factual errors, ambiguities, or contradictions. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe problem requires two parts: first, a derivation of a general expression, and second, a calculation of a specific value based on that expression.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the general expression.\n\nLet $n$ be the total number of independent endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) samples taken.\nLet $p$ be the probability that a single sample is diagnostic for myocarditis. We are given $p = 0.2$.\nLet $A_i$ be the event that the $i$-th sample is diagnostic, for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$. We have $P(A_i) = p$.\nThe samples are stated to be independent.\nThe goal is to find the probability that at least one of the $n$ samples is diagnostic. Let this event be $D$.\nThe event $D$ can be expressed as the union of the individual events: $D = A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\ldots \\cup A_n$.\n\nAs stipulated, we will use the complement rule. The complement of event $D$, denoted $D^c$, is the event that *no* samples are diagnostic. This means that for all $i$ from $1$ to $n$, the sample is *not* diagnostic.\nLet $A_i^c$ be the complement of $A_i$, meaning the event that the $i$-th sample is not diagnostic.\nUsing the complement rule for a single event, the probability of a single sample not being diagnostic is:\n$$P(A_i^c) = 1 - P(A_i) = 1 - p$$\nThe event $D^c$ is that all samples are not diagnostic, which can be written as the intersection of the individual non-diagnostic events:\n$$D^c = A_1^c \\cap A_2^c \\cap \\ldots \\cap A_n^c$$\nThe problem states that the samples are independent. Consequently, the events $A_i^c$ are also independent. The probability of the intersection of independent events is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(D^c) = P(A_1^c \\cap A_2^c \\cap \\ldots \\cap A_n^c) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(A_i^c)$$\nSince $P(A_i^c) = 1-p$ for all $i$, this becomes:\n$$P(D^c) = (1-p)^n$$\nFinally, we apply the complement rule again to find the probability of event $D$:\n$$P(D) = 1 - P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(D^c)$, we arrive at the general expression for the probability that at least one of $n$ independent samples is diagnostic:\n$$P(D) = 1 - (1-p)^n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the minimum number of samples.\n\nWe are given the probability of a single success $p=0.2$ and the requirement that the overall probability of detecting myocarditis must be at least $0.95$. Using the derived formula:\n$$1 - (1-p)^n \\ge 0.95$$\nSubstitute the given value of $p=0.2$:\n$$1 - (1-0.2)^n \\ge 0.95$$\n$$1 - (0.8)^n \\ge 0.95$$\nTo solve for $n$, we rearrange the inequality:\n$$-(0.8)^n \\ge 0.95 - 1$$\n$$-(0.8)^n \\ge -0.05$$\nMultiplying both sides by $-1$ reverses the inequality sign:\n$$(0.8)^n \\le 0.05$$\nTo isolate the exponent $n$, we take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides. Since the natural logarithm is a strictly increasing function, the direction of the inequality is preserved.\n$$\\ln((0.8)^n) \\le \\ln(0.05)$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a)$:\n$$n \\ln(0.8) \\le \\ln(0.05)$$\nTo solve for $n$, we must divide by $\\ln(0.8)$. It is critical to note that for any number $x$ such that $0 < x < 1$, its natural logarithm $\\ln(x)$ is negative. Since $\\ln(0.8)$ is negative, dividing by it will again reverse the inequality sign:\n$$n \\ge \\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{\\ln(0.8)}$$\nNow, we can compute the value of the right-hand side:\n$$\\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{\\ln(0.8)} \\approx \\frac{-2.99573}{-0.22314} \\approx 13.425$$\nSo, the inequality is:\n$$n \\ge 13.425$$\nSince the number of samples $n$ must be an integer, the smallest integer value of $n$ that satisfies this condition is $14$.\n\nThus, a minimum of $14$ samples is required to ensure that the probability of detecting myocarditis is at least $0.95$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{14}\n$$", "id": "4412283"}, {"introduction": "Myocarditis can compromise the heart's mechanical function, leading to a reduction in cardiac output.
