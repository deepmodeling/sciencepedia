The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of solid mechanics, well-posed with sufficient and realistic data, and objectively stated.\n\nWe begin by deriving the formula for circumferential (hoop) stress, $\\sigma_{\\theta}$, in a thin-walled cylinder, as stipulated. This is an application of Laplace's law. We consider a segment of the cylindrical vessel of length $L$ and diameter $D$. Imagine cutting this segment in half along its longitudinal axis. For the vessel to be in static equilibrium, the outward force exerted by the intraluminal pressure $P$ must be balanced by the inward force resulting from the tension in the vessel wall.\n\nThe outward force, $F_P$, due to pressure acts on the projected rectangular area of the half-cylinder, which is $D \\times L$.\n$$F_P = P \\cdot (D \\cdot L)$$\nThe resisting inward force, $F_W$, is provided by the circumferential stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ acting on the two cut cross-sectional areas of the wall. Each cut surface has an area of $t \\times L$, where $t$ is the wall thickness. Therefore, the total area resisting the pressure-induced force is $2 \\cdot t \\cdot L$.\n$$F_W = \\sigma_{\\theta} \\cdot (2 \\cdot t \\cdot L)$$\nFor equilibrium, these forces must be equal:\n$$F_P = F_W$$\n$$P \\cdot D \\cdot L = \\sigma_{\\theta} \\cdot 2 \\cdot t \\cdot L$$\nWe can cancel the length $L$ from both sides, which shows that the stress is independent of the length of the segment considered. Rearranging the equation to solve for the hoop stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ gives us the standard form of Laplace's law for a thin-walled cylinder:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta} = \\frac{P \\cdot D}{2 \\cdot t}$$\nThe problem states that the intraluminal pressure $P$ and the wall thickness $t$ remain approximately constant during the enlargement of the aneurysm. We are given the initial diameter, $D_1 = 4.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, and the final diameter, $D_2 = 6.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nLet $\\sigma_{\\theta,1}$ be the initial circumferential stress and $\\sigma_{\\theta,2}$ be the final circumferential stress. Using the derived formula, we can write expressions for both:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta,1} = \\frac{P \\cdot D_1}{2 \\cdot t}$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta,2} = \\frac{P \\cdot D_2}{2 \\cdot t}$$\nWe are asked to find the percent increase in stress, which is defined as the change in stress divided by the initial stress. We will express this as a decimal.\n$$\\text{Percent Increase} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\theta,2} - \\sigma_{\\theta,1}}{\\sigma_{\\theta,1}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\theta,2}}{\\sigma_{\\theta,1}} - 1$$\nNow, we can compute the ratio $\\frac{\\sigma_{\\theta,2}}{\\sigma_{\\theta,1}}$:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_{\\theta,2}}{\\sigma_{\\theta,1}} = \\frac{\\frac{P \\cdot D_2}{2 \\cdot t}}{\\frac{P \\cdot D_1}{2 \\cdot t}}$$\nSince $P$ and $t$ are constant, the terms $\\frac{P}{2t}$ cancel, leaving a simple ratio of the diameters:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_{\\theta,2}}{\\sigma_{\\theta,1}} = \\frac{D_2}{D_1}$$\nThis demonstrates that for a thin-walled cylinder under constant pressure and with constant wall thickness, the circumferential wall stress is directly proportional to its diameter.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values for the diameters:\n$$\\frac{D_2}{D_1} = \\frac{6.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}}{4.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}} = 1.5$$\nThe ratio of the final stress to the initial stress is $1.5$. We can now calculate the percent increase:\n$$\\text{Percent Increase} = 1.5 - 1 = 0.5$$\nThe problem requires the result as a decimal rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$\\text{Percent Increase} = 0.500$$\nThis corresponds to a $50\\%$ increase in wall stress.\n\nFinally, we provide the requested biomechanical interpretation. This result illustrates a critical aspect of aneurysm progression: as the aneurysm expands, the stress on its wall increases, even if the blood pressure does not. This increase in wall stress exacerbates the underlying wall weakness, creating a dangerous positive feedback cycle that promotes further aneurysmal expansion and elevates the risk of catastrophic rupture.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.500}$$", "id": "4326668"}, {"introduction": "The mechanical weakening of the aortic wall in an aneurysm is not just a physical process but is rooted in cellular and extracellular matrix pathology. This practice problem models the degradation of elastin, a key structural protein, using a first-order kinetic model.

Consider a simplified turnover model for the elastin fraction $E(t)$ in the media of the abdominal aorta, where the rate of degradation is proportional to the current elastin fraction with proportionality constant $k_d$, and synthesis is negligible over the time horizon. At baseline ($t=0$), the elastin fraction is $E(0)=0.30$.

The problem states that the rate of degradation of elastin is proportional to the current elastin fraction, with a proportionality constant $k_d$. It also specifies that synthesis is negligible. This kinetic principle can be mathematically expressed as a first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dt} = -k_d E(t) $$\nThe negative sign indicates that the quantity $E(t)$ is decreasing over time due to degradation. The given initial condition is $E(0) = 0.30$.\n\nThis is a separable linear homogeneous differential equation. We can rearrange the terms to separate the variables $E$ and $t$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{E} dE = -k_d dt $$\nWe integrate both sides of the equation. The left side is integrated from the initial elastin fraction $E(0)$ to the fraction $E(t)$ at a later time $t$, and the right side is integrated from the initial time $t=0$ to time $t$:\n$$ \\int_{E(0)}^{E(t)} \\frac{1}{E'} dE' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k_d dt' $$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$ [\\ln(E')]_{E(0)}^{E(t)} = [-k_d t']_{0}^{t} $$\n$$ \\ln(E(t)) - \\ln(E(0)) = -k_d t - 0 $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{E(t)}{E(0)}\\right) = -k_d t $$\nTo solve for $E(t)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$ \\frac{E(t)}{E(0)} = \\exp(-k_d t) $$\n$$ E(t) = E(0) \\exp(-k_d t) $$\nThis equation describes the exponential decay of the elastin fraction over time.\n\nNext, we compute the absolute decrease in elastin fraction over one year, defined as $\\Delta E = E(0) - E(1)$. We are given the values $E(0) = 0.30$ and $k_d = 0.05\\ \\text{year}^{-1}$. We first find the elastin fraction at $t=1\\ \\text{year}$:\n$$ E(1) = E(0) \\exp(-k_d \\cdot 1) = 0.30 \\exp(-0.05) $$\nNow, we can calculate $\\Delta E$:\n$$ \\Delta E = E(0) - E(1) = 0.30 - 0.30 \\exp(-0.05) $$\n$$ \\Delta E = 0.30 (1 - \\exp(-0.05)) $$\nUsing the value for the exponential function, $\\exp(-0.05) \\approx 0.95122942$:\n$$ \\Delta E \\approx 0.30 (1 - 0.95122942) = 0.30 (0.04877058) $$\n$$ \\Delta E \\approx 0.014631174 $$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is $1$, so the fourth is $3$. The following digit is $1$, so we do not round up.\n$$ \\Delta E \\approx 0.01463 $$\n\nFinally, we discuss the implications of this reduction in elastin for the mechanical integrity and rupture risk of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA), using the law of Laplace. The circumferential wall tension is given by $T=Pr$. Here, $T$ is the circumferential wall tension (force per unit axial length), $P$ is the transmural pressure, and $r$ is the vessel radius.\n\nThe problem assumes that $P$ and $r$ do not change appreciably over the one-year period. Therefore, the total circumferential tension $T$ that the aortic wall must withstand remains constant. The aortic wall is a composite biological tissue, with its mechanical properties determined primarily by the relative amounts and arrangement of elastin and collagen fibers.\n\nElastin is a highly extensible protein responsible for the elasticity of the artery wall, allowing it to expand and recoil during the cardiac cycle. It bears most of the mechanical load under normal physiological pressures. Collagen is a much stiffer protein that is typically crimped at low strains and becomes engaged at higher strains, providing tensile strength and preventing the vessel from overstretching and rupturing.\n\nThe calculated decrease in the elastin fraction $E$ signifies a loss of this critical, elastic, load-bearing component. With less elastin available, the constant tension $T$ must be redistributed among the remaining structural elements of the wall. This leads to an increase in the mechanical stress (force per unit area) on the remaining elastin fibers and, more critically, forces the stiffer collagen fibers to bear load at lower levels of overall vessel strain than in a healthy artery.\n\nThis shift in load-bearing from the compliant elastin to the stiff collagen makes the vessel wall as a whole significantly stiffer. From a mechanical integrity standpoint, this means the tissue is operating closer to its ultimate failure point under normal physiological loading conditions. The progressive loss of elastin weakens the structural framework of the aortic wall, making it more susceptible to fatigue failure and damage accumulation. Consequently, a reduction in the elastin fraction $E$ directly correlates with a compromised mechanical integrity and an elevated risk of catastrophic rupture of the AAA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.01463}$$", "id": "4326658"}, {"introduction": "Predicting the precise moment an aneurysm will reach a critical size is impossible, as biological growth is inherently variable.
