The axillary lymph nodes are negative, and the tumor is Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) negative.

The question is well-posed, objective, and requires the application of a formal, algorithmic process, leading to a unique, verifiable solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe AJCC 8th edition staging for breast cancer utilizes two systems: an anatomic stage group based solely on the TNM classification, and a more comprehensive clinical prognostic stage group that integrates the anatomic stage with key biological factors. The problem explicitly requires the use of the clinical prognostic stage.\n\nThe provided parameters are:\n*   $T$ category: $T_{2}$ (tumor size greater than $20$ mm but no more than $50$ mm)\n*   $N$ category: $N_{1}$ (metastases to $1$–$3$ axillary lymph nodes)\n*   $M$ category: $M_{0}$ (no distant metastases)\n*   Histologic Grade (G): $2$ (moderately differentiated)\n*   $ER$ Status: Positive\n*   $PR$ Status: Positive\n*   $HER2$ Status: Negative\n\nThe procedure is to first identify the anatomic stage and then use the prognostic factors to determine the final prognostic stage group.\n\n**1. Determine the Anatomic Stage Group:**\nThe anatomic stage is determined by the combination of $T$, $N$, and $M$ categories. For the given combination of $T_{2}N_{1}M_{0}$, the AJCC 8th edition Anatomic Stage Group is **Stage IIB**.\n\n**2. Determine the Clinical Prognostic Stage Group:**\nThe clinical prognostic stage integrates the anatomic stage with the tumor's biological profile. We must consult the AJCC 8th edition Prognostic Stage Group table for breast cancer, which stratifies patients based on the full set of parameters. We are looking for the entry corresponding to the patient's profile: $T_{2}$, $N_{1}$, $M_{0}$, Grade $2$, $ER$-Positive, $HER2$-Negative.\n\nAccording to the AJCC 8th Edition Clinical Prognostic Stage table:\n*   A tumor with anatomic stage components $T_{2}N_{1}M_{0}$ that is also $ER$-positive and $HER2$-negative is evaluated based on its histologic grade.\n*   For the combination of $T_{2}N_{1}$ ($M_0$), $ER$-positive, $HER2$-negative:\n    *   If Grade is $1$, the prognostic stage is Stage IB.\n    *   If Grade is $2$, the prognostic stage is **Stage IIA**.\n    *   If Grade is $3$, the prognostic stage is Stage IIA.\n\nThe patient's tumor is Grade $2$. Therefore, the correct Clinical Prognostic Stage Group is **Stage IIA**. This represents a down-staging from the anatomic stage of IIB, which reflects the more favorable prognosis of this biological subtype (hormone receptor-positive, $HER2$-negative) compared to what the tumor size and nodal involvement alone would suggest. The positive $PR$ status further supports the hormone receptor-positive classification but does not alter the stage assignment in this specific context.\n\n**3.

It is a standard, well-posed problem in survival analysis.\n-   **Action:** Proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the incremental hazard ratio, $\\Delta HR$, and its numerical evaluation. The starting point is the definition of the Cox proportional hazards model and the specific definition of $\\Delta HR$ provided.\n\nThe Cox proportional hazards model is given by:\n$$\nh(t \\mid \\mathbf{X}) = h_{0}(t)\\,\\exp(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X})\n$$\nwhere $h(t \\mid \\mathbf{X})$ is the hazard rate at time $t$ for a subject with a vector of covariates $\\mathbf{X}$, $h_{0}(t)$ is the baseline hazard function, and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is the vector of regression coefficients.\n\nThe vector of covariates $\\mathbf{X}$ can be partitioned to explicitly represent the LVI status and the vector of all other covariates, $\\mathbf{Z}$. The linear predictor term in the exponent, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X}$, can thus be written as:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{\\top}\\mathbf{X} = \\beta_{\\text{LVI}} \\cdot (\\text{LVI}) + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\mathbf{Z}}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Z}\n$$\nwhere $\\text{LVI}$ is the binary variable ($1$ or $0$) and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\mathbf{Z}}$ is the vector of coefficients for the other covariates $\\mathbf{Z}$.\n\nThe incremental hazard, $\\Delta HR$, is defined by comparing two patients who are identical except for their LVI status. Let's write the hazard functions for these two scenarios.\n\nFor a patient with LVI present ($\\text{LVI}=1$), the hazard function is:\n$$\nh(t \\mid \\text{LVI}=1,\\,\\mathbf{Z}) = h_{0}(t)\\,\\exp\\left(\\beta_{\\text{LVI}} \\cdot 1 + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\mathbf{Z}}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Z}\\right)\n$$\n\nFor an otherwise identical patient with LVI absent ($\\text{LVI}=0$), the hazard function is:\n$$\nh(t \\mid \\text{LVI}=0,\\,\\mathbf{Z}) = h_{0}(t)\\,\\exp\\left(\\beta_{\\text{LVI}} \\cdot 0 + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\mathbf{Z}}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Z}\\right) = h_{0}(t)\\,\\exp\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\mathbf{Z}}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Z}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the given definition of $\\Delta HR$:\n$$\n\\Delta HR = \\frac{h(t \\mid \\text{LVI}=1,\\,\\mathbf{Z})}{h(t \\mid \\text{LVI}=0,\\,\\mathbf{Z})} - 1 = \\frac{h_{0}(t)\\,\\exp\\left(\\beta_{\\text{LVI}} + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\mathbf{Z}}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Z}\\right)}{h_{0}(t)\\,\\exp\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\mathbf{Z}}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Z}\\right)} - 1\n$$\n\nThe baseline hazard function $h_{0}(t)$ cancels from the numerator and the denominator. This is a direct consequence of the \"proportional hazards\" assumption, which implies that the ratio of the hazards for any two individuals is constant over time. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Delta HR = \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\beta_{\\text{LVI}} + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\mathbf{Z}}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Z}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\mathbf{Z}}^{\\top}\\mathbf{Z}\\right)} - 1\n$$\n\nUsing the property of exponential functions, $\\exp(a+b) / \\exp(b) = \\exp(a)$, we can further simplify the expression:\n$$\n\\Delta HR = \\exp(\\beta_{\\text{LVI}}) - 1\n$$\nThis is the derived analytical expression for $\\Delta HR$ in terms of $\\beta_{\\text{LVI}}$. This quantity represents the proportional increase in hazard associated with the presence of LVI, holding all other covariates constant. The term $\\exp(\\beta_{\\text{LVI}})$ is the hazard ratio (HR) for LVI.\n\nThe problem provides the numerical value for the coefficient, $\\beta_{\\text{LVI}} = 0.45$. We substitute this value into the derived expression to find the numerical value of $\\Delta HR$:\n$$\n\\Delta HR = \\exp(0.45) - 1\n$$\n\nUsing a calculator, we evaluate the expression:\n$$\n\\exp(0.45) \\approx 1.56831218549\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta HR \\approx 1.56831218549 - 1 = 0.56831218549\n$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final numerical answer to four significant figures. The first four significant figures of $0.56831218549$ are $5$, $6$, $8$, and $3$. The fifth significant figure is $1$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (truncate).\n\nTherefore, the numerical value of $\\Delta HR$ rounded to four significant figures is $0.5683$.
