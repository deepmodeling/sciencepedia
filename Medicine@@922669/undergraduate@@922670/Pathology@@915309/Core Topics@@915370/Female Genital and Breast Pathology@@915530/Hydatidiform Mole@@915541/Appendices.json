The entities discussed—complete hydatidiform mole, partial hydatidiform mole, and hydropic abortus—are real, distinct clinicopathologic diagnoses with well-characterized histologic and genetic features. The request to reason from principles of genomic imprinting is appropriate, as these principles are central to the pathogenesis of molar pregnancies.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It presents a classification task where combinations of defined features are mapped to specific diagnoses. Based on established medical knowledge, a unique, correct set of answers can be determined.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is objective. The histologic features are observable, describable findings, and the diagnoses are internationally standardized medical terms. The language is precise and free of subjectivity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. Therefore, it is **valid**. The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nThe key to distinguishing hydropic placental conditions—complete mole, partial mole, and hydropic abortus—lies in their genetic origin, which dictates their development due to the phenomenon of genomic imprinting. In humans, paternal genes preferentially drive the development of the placenta (trophoblast), whereas maternal genes preferentially drive the development of the embryo proper.\n\n1.  **Complete Hydatidiform Mole (CHM):**\n    -   **Genetics and Imprinting:** A CHM is androgenetic, meaning its genome is exclusively of paternal origin. It is diploid, typically $46,XX$ (from fertilization of an anucleated ovum by a single sperm that then duplicates) or $46,XY$ (dispermic fertilization of an anucleated ovum). The complete absence of the maternal genome and a double dose of the paternal genome leads to a profound developmental imbalance.\n    -   **Pathologic Consequences:** The unopposed drive for placental growth results in exuberant, disorganized proliferation of trophoblast, which is typically circumferential around the villi. The absence of a maternal genome means no embryo can form. Without an embryo, there is no impetus for organized vasculogenesis, so the villous stroma remains avascular. The avascular stroma accumulates fluid, leading to marked, diffuse villous edema and the formation of central, fluid-filled cavities known as cisterns. The lack of an embryo means no fetal blood vessels will be present.\n\n2.  **Partial Hydatidiform Mole (PHM):**\n    -   **Genetics and Imprinting:** A PHM is typically diandric triploid, containing two paternal sets of chromosomes and one maternal set ($69,XXY$, $69,XXX$, or $69,XYY$). The usual mechanism is fertilization of a normal ovum by two sperm. The presence of a maternal genome allows for the development of an embryo/fetus, though it is almost always malformed and non-viable. The ratio of paternal to maternal genomes is $2:1$, an imbalance that still favors trophoblastic growth, but less extremely than in a CHM.\n    -   **Pathologic Consequences:** The presence of an embryonic circulation leads to the development of fetal vessels within placental villi. The relative excess of paternal genes drives focal trophoblastic hyperplasia. A characteristic finding is irregularly shaped, \"scalloped\" villi with invaginations of trophoblast creating \"trophoblastic inclusions\" within the stroma. Villi show variable hydropic swelling, resulting in a mixture of small and large villi; prominent cistern formation like that of a CHM is rare.\n\n3.  **Hydropic Abortus (HA):**\n    -   **Genetics and Imprinting:** A hydropic abortus is a non-molar spontaneous abortion. Genetically, it is biparental (one maternal, one paternal genome set) and can be chromosomally normal (e.g., $46,XX$) or abnormal (e.g., trisomies, monosomy X), but it is not androgenetic or triploid in the molar sense. The paternal-to-maternal genome ratio is balanced ($1:1$).\n    -   **Pathologic Consequences:** An embryo/fetus forms, so fetal vessels are present in the villi. Because there is no genetic imbalance favoring trophoblastic growth, there is no significant or abnormal trophoblastic hyperplasia. Villous edema, which can be diffuse, is a secondary, degenerative change resulting from fetal demise and circulatory collapse. It does not typically lead to the large cisterns of a CHM. The specific features of a partial mole, such as scalloping and inclusions, are absent.\n\nThis framework allows for a systematic evaluation of each option.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Diffuse villous edema, cistern formation, circumferential trophoblastic hyperplasia, and no fetal vessels correspond to complete hydatidiform mole.**\n-   **Reasoning:** This combination of features perfectly matches the expected pathology of a CHM based on its androgenetic origin.\n    -   *Circumferential trophoblastic hyperplasia* is the direct result of the unopposed paternal gene expression.\n    -   The lack of an embryo (due to no maternal genome) explains the *absence of fetal vessels*.\n    -   *Diffuse villous edema* and *cistern formation* are consequences of the avascular stroma becoming massively swollen.\n-   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. Scalloped villi with trophoblastic inclusions, presence of fetal vessels, and circumferential trophoblastic hyperplasia correspond to hydropic abortus.**\n-   **Reasoning:** This option incorrectly combines features from three distinct entities.\n    -   *Scalloped villi with trophoblastic inclusions* are pathognomonic for a partial mole (PHM).\n    -   *Circumferential trophoblastic hyperplasia* is a feature of a complete mole (CHM).\n    -   A *hydropic abortus* (HA) would have neither of these features; its defining characteristic is a lack of significant trophoblastic hyperplasia.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Diffuse villous edema, absence of cistern formation, absence of circumferential trophoblastic hyperplasia, and presence of fetal vessels correspond to hydropic abortus.**\n-   **Reasoning:** This description accurately fits a hydropic abortus and distinguishes it from molar pregnancies.\n    -   *Presence of fetal vessels* is expected, as an embryo formed from a biparental conceptus.\n    -   *Absence of circumferential trophoblastic hyperplasia* is the key negative finding, reflecting the normal balance of genomic imprinting.\n    -   *Diffuse villous edema* can occur as a secondary change.\n    -   *Absence of cistern formation* distinguishes it from a classic CHM.\n-   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**D. Diffuse villous edema, cistern formation, circumferential trophoblastic hyperplasia, and presence of fetal vessels correspond to complete hydatidiform mole.**\n-   **Reasoning:** This option contains a critical internal contradiction. The presence of diffuse edema, cisterns, and circumferential hyperplasia strongly suggests a CHM. However, the *presence of fetal vessels* is fundamentally inconsistent with the diagnosis of a classic CHM, which is defined by the absence of an embryo and thus an absence of fetal vasculature. The presence of vessels points towards a diagnosis of partial mole or hydropic abortus.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Scalloped villi with trophoblastic inclusions, presence of fetal vessels, and lack of circumferential trophoblastic hyperplasia correspond to partial hydatidiform mole.**\n-   **Reasoning:** This is an accurate description of a PHM.\n    -   *Scalloped villi with trophoblastic inclusions* is the most specific histologic feature of PHM.\n    -   *Presence of fetal vessels* is expected due to the formation of a fetus in this diandric triploid condition.\n    -   *Lack of circumferential trophoblastic hyperplasia* correctly describes the hyperplasia in PHM, which is characteristically focal and less prominent than in CHM. Stating it as a negative finding (\"lack of circumferential...\") is a valid way to differentiate it from CHM.\n-   **Verdict:** Correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "4384367"}, {"introduction": "Following the evacuation of a hydatidiform mole, clinical management transitions to vigilant biochemical surveillance using serial human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels.

It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe primary task is to apply the established diagnostic criteria for post-molar Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN) to the provided serial hCG data. The FIGO oncologic criteria (2000) are the standard for this diagnosis. GTN is diagnosed if any of the following are met:\n\n1.  A plateau in hCG levels: Classically defined as four measurements with variation less than $\\pm 10\\%$ over three consecutive weeks (e.g., measurements on days $1$, $8$, $15$, $22$). A clinically practical variant is three consecutive weekly measurements with less than $10\\%$ change.\n2.  A rise in hCG levels: An increase of more than $10\\%$ across two consecutive weekly measurements (i.e., three total values, e.g., on days $1$, $8$, $15$).\n3.  Persistence of detectable hCG for more than $6$ months post-evacuation.\n4.  Histologic diagnosis of choriocarcinoma.\n\nLet's analyze the provided hCG data:\n$h_1 = 45{,}000$\n$h_2 = 14{,}000$\n$h_3 = 7{,}600$\n$h_4 = 7{,}100$\n$h_5 = 7{,}400$\n$h_6 = 7{,}350$\n\nThe initial decline from Week $1$ to Week $3$ is normal. The values of concern are from Week $4$ to Week $6$, where the decline has stopped. Let's analyze these three consecutive measurements: $h_4 = 7{,}100$, $h_5 = 7{,}400$, and $h_6 = 7{,}350$.\n\n**Check for Rising Criterion:**\n-   From Week $4$ to Week $5$: Change is $7{,}400 - 7{,}100 = +300$. Percentage change is $\\frac{300}{7{,}100} \\times 100\\% \\approx 4.2\\%$. This is not a rise of $> 10\\%$.\n-   From Week $5$ to Week $6$: Change is $7{,}350 - 7{,}400 = -50$. This is a decrease.\n-   The criteria for a rising hCG trend are not met.\n\n**Check for Plateau Criterion:**\nLet's evaluate if the three consecutive values ($h_4$, $h_5$, $h_6$) represent a plateau. A plateau is defined by values that vary by less than $10\\%$.\n-   Let's use the first value, $h_4 = 7{,}100\\ \\mathrm{mIU/mL}$, as the reference. The range for a $\\pm 10\\%$ variation is $[7{,}100 \\times (1-0.10), 7{,}100 \\times (1+0.10)]$, which is $[6{,}390, 7{,}810]$.\n-   The second value, $h_5 = 7{,}400\\ \\mathrm{mIU/mL}$, is within this range.\n-   The third value, $h_6 = 7{,}350\\ \\mathrm{mIU/mL}$, is also within this range.\nSince three consecutive weekly hCG measurements fall within a $\\pm 10\\%$ range, the **plateau criterion is met**.\n\nThis finding establishes a diagnosis of **postmolar Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN)**.\n\n**Determine Appropriate Management:**\nOnce GTN is diagnosed, the standard management protocol is as follows:\n1.  **Staging and Risk Assessment**: The patient must be staged to determine the extent of the disease and risk-stratified to guide therapy. Staging includes a physical examination, pelvic examination, and imaging, starting with a chest radiograph to screen for pulmonary metastases (the most common site). The WHO Prognostic Scoring System is then used. A score of $0-6$ indicates low-risk disease, while a score of $\\ge 7$ indicates high-risk disease.\n    -   In this case, the patient's WHO score would likely be low. Factors: age $<40$ (score $0$), mole antecedent (score $0$), interval $<4$ months (score $0$), hCG level between $10^3$ and $10^4$ (score $1$). Assuming no metastases are found on staging (patient is asymptomatic), the total score would be $1$. This is **low-risk GTN**.\n2.  **Treatment**: For low-risk GTN, the standard treatment is single-agent chemotherapy (e.g., methotrexate or actinomycin-D). For high-risk GTN, multi-agent chemotherapy is required.\n3.  **Contraception**: The patient must be on reliable contraception to prevent a new pregnancy, as rising hCG from a pregnancy would be indistinguishable from that of persistent or recurrent GTN.\n4.  **Follow-up**: Weekly hCG monitoring must be continued throughout treatment to assess response and until remission (three consecutive weekly normal levels) is achieved and confirmed.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Options**\n\n-   **A. Meets plateau criterion; diagnose postmolar Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN), perform staging including chest radiograph and assign a World Health Organization (WHO) risk score, then initiate single-agent chemotherapy (for low-risk disease), with reliable contraception and continued hCG monitoring.**\n    -   The analysis confirms the data meet the **plateau criterion**. The subsequent diagnosis of GTN is correct. The management plan described—staging, risk scoring, initiation of single-agent chemotherapy for what is almost certainly low-risk disease, plus contraception and continued monitoring—is the complete and accurate standard of care.\n    -   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n-   **B. Meets remission; change to monthly hCG monitoring for $6$ months with reliable contraception, no further intervention.**\n    -   Remission is defined by normal hCG levels (typically $<5\\ \\mathrm{mIU/mL}$). The patient's hCG is $>7{,}000\\ \\mathrm{mIU/mL}$. The criterion for remission is not met. This option is factually incorrect.\n    -   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **C. Meets rising criterion; repeat suction curettage only.**\n    -   The data do not meet the rising criterion (rise must be $>10\\%$). A repeat curettage is not the primary treatment for diagnosed GTN, which is a systemic disease requiring chemotherapy. This intervention is inappropriate as the sole therapy.\n    -   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D. Meets plateau criterion; continue weekly hCG surveillance without intervention.**\n    -   While it correctly identifies that the plateau criterion is met, the recommended action is wrong. Meeting the plateau criterion is a diagnosis of GTN, a form of cancer that requires active treatment. \"Watchful waiting\" is not the standard of care and would allow the malignancy to progress.\n    -   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies the hCG trend and outlines the appropriate, comprehensive management plan according to established medical guidelines is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4384368"}, {"introduction": "When surveillance data indicate the development of postmolar Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN) [@problem_id:4384368], the next crucial step is to stratify the patient's risk to guide treatment.
