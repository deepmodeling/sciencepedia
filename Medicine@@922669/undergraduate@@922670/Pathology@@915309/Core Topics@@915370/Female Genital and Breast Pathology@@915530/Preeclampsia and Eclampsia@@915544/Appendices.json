In normal pregnancy, extravillous trophoblast-mediated remodeling transforms high-resistance, narrow spiral arteries into low-resistance conduits with enlarged lumens. Suppose that in a particular spiral artery the post-remodeling (normal) lumen radius is $r_{0}$, but in an impaired-remodeling state the radius is reduced to $r=\\frac{1}{2}r_{0}$, while the vessel length $L$ and blood viscosity $\\eta$ remain unchanged. Assume laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid and a constant pressure drop $\\Delta P$ across the artery.\n\nStarting from the empirically validated hemodynamic relation for laminar flow through a cylindrical tube (Poiseuille’s law) $R=\\frac{8\\eta L}{\\pi r^{4}}$ and the definition of volumetric flow $Q=\\frac{\\Delta P}{R}$, derive the multiplicative change in hydraulic resistance and volumetric flow produced by the $50\\%$ reduction in lumen radius, each expressed as a ratio relative to the normal-remodeled state.

We are given the relationships for hydraulic resistance $R$ and volumetric flow $Q$.\n\nLet the normal state be denoted by the subscript 'normal' and the impaired-remodeling (new) state by the subscript 'new'.\n\nIn the normal state, the lumen radius is $r_{\\text{normal}} = r_{0}$. The hydraulic resistance, according to Poiseuille's law, is:\n$$R_{\\text{normal}} = \\frac{8\\eta L}{\\pi r_{\\text{normal}}^{4}} = \\frac{8\\eta L}{\\pi r_{0}^{4}}$$\nHere, $\\eta$ is the blood viscosity and $L$ is the vessel length, both of which are constant between the two states.\n\nIn the impaired-remodeling state, the radius is reduced to half its normal value:\n$$r_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{1}{2} r_{0}$$\nThe resistance in this new state is:\n$$R_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{8\\eta L}{\\pi r_{\\text{new}}^{4}} = \\frac{8\\eta L}{\\pi \\left(\\frac{1}{2}r_{0}\\right)^{4}}$$\nSimplifying the denominator:\n$$R_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{8\\eta L}{\\pi \\left(\\frac{1}{16}r_{0}^{4}\\right)} = 16 \\left( \\frac{8\\eta L}{\\pi r_{0}^{4}} \\right)$$\nBy substituting the expression for $R_{\\text{normal}}$, we find the relationship between the new and normal resistance:\n$$R_{\\text{new}} = 16 R_{\\text{normal}}$$\nThe multiplicative change in resistance is the ratio $\\frac{R_{\\text{new}}}{R_{\\text{normal}}}$:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\text{new}}}{R_{\\text{normal}}} = 16$$\nThus, a $50\\%$ reduction in radius leads to a $16$-fold increase in hydraulic resistance.\n\nNext, we calculate the change in volumetric flow, $Q$. The relationship between flow, pressure drop $\\Delta P$, and resistance $R$ is given as $Q = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R}$. The problem specifies that the pressure drop $\\Delta P$ is constant across the artery in both states.\n\nThe flow in the normal state is:\n$$Q_{\\text{normal}} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_{\\text{normal}}}$$\nThe flow in the new state is:\n$$Q_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_{\\text{new}}}$$\nTo find the multiplicative change in flow, we compute the ratio $\\frac{Q_{\\text{new}}}{Q_{\\text{normal}}}$:\n$$\\frac{Q_{\\text{new}}}{Q_{\\text{normal}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\Delta P}{R_{\\text{new}}}}{\\frac{\\Delta P}{R_{\\text{normal}}}}$$\nSince $\\Delta P$ is constant, it cancels out:\n$$\\frac{Q_{\\text{new}}}{Q_{\\text{normal}}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{normal}}}{R_{\\text{new}}}$$\nFrom our previous calculation, we know that $\\frac{R_{\\text{new}}}{R_{\\text{normal}}} = 16$. Therefore, the ratio of the resistances is $\\frac{R_{\\text{normal}}}{R_{\\text{new}}} = \\frac{1}{16}$.\n$$\\frac{Q_{\\text{new}}}{Q_{\\text{normal}}} = \\frac{1}{16}$$\nThis shows that the volumetric blood flow is reduced to 1/16th of its normal value.\n\nThe physiologic implication of this result is profound. The fourth-power dependence of resistance on radius ($R \\propto r^{-4}$) means that even a moderate reduction in the caliber of the spiral arteries has a dramatic effect on uteroplacental perfusion. A $50\\%$ reduction in radius causes a $16$-fold increase in resistance and, consequently, a $93.75\\%$ reduction in blood flow (since flow is reduced to $\\frac{1}{16} \\approx 6.25\\%$). This severe reduction in blood flow, or malperfusion, leads to placental ischemia and hypoxia. This state of placental insufficiency is a central pathogenic mechanism in preeclampsia, contributing to fetal growth restriction and triggering the release of anti-angiogenic factors from the stressed placenta into the maternal circulation, which causes the systemic maternal syndrome of hypertension and endothelial dysfunction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 16  \\frac{1}{16} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4435665"}, {"introduction": "The consequences of placental insufficiency extend far beyond the uterus, triggering a systemic maternal syndrome.

This exercise will demonstrate how widespread vasoconstriction, a hallmark of the maternal response, drives the development of hypertension even when cardiac output may decrease.", "problem": "In the pathophysiology of preeclampsia, widespread endothelial dysfunction and vasoconstriction increase Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR), while intravascular volume contraction and myocardial loading changes can decrease Cardiac Output (CO). Hemodynamic behavior is well captured by the circulatory analog of Ohm’s law, which relates perfusion pressure to flow and resistance. Under conditions where constants of proportionality and Central Venous Pressure (CVP) remain unchanged, the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) is directly proportional to the product of flow and resistance.\n\nConsider a pregnant patient with a baseline Cardiac Output (CO) of $6$ liters per minute and a baseline Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR) of $1200$ dyn s cm$^{-5}$. Due to preeclampsia, suppose SVR increases by $30\\%$ and CO decreases by $15\\%$.

The fractional change, $\\Delta_{frac}$, is defined as the change in the quantity divided by its initial value:\n$$\\Delta_{frac} = \\frac{MAP_{new} - MAP_{base}}{MAP_{base}}$$\n\nWe can simplify this expression:\n$$\\Delta_{frac} = \\frac{MAP_{new}}{MAP_{base}} - 1$$\n\nSubstituting the relationship $MAP_{new} = 1.105 \\cdot MAP_{base}$:\n$$\\Delta_{frac} = \\frac{1.105 \\cdot MAP_{base}}{MAP_{base}} - 1$$\n$$\\Delta_{frac} = 1.105 - 1$$\n$$\\Delta_{frac} = 0.105$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. The value $0.105$ has three significant figures.
