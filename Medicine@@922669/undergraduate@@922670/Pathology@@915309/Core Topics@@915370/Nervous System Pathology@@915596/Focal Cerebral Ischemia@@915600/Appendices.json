It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe problem describes steady, laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid through a rigid cylindrical tube. This physical situation is governed by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which gives the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, as a function of the tube's geometry and the fluid's properties. In this context, the cerebral blood flow (CBF) is the volumetric flow rate $Q$.\n\nThe Hagen-Poiseuille equation is:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\nwhere $r$ is the radius of the arteriole, $\\Delta P$ is the pressure difference across its length $L$, and $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the blood.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the pressure difference $\\Delta P$, the arteriole length $L$, and the blood viscosity $\\eta$ are all constant for the measurement interval. We can therefore group these constants into a single proportionality constant, $k$:\n$$k = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\nThe relationship between CBF ($Q$) and arteriole radius ($r$) simplifies to:\n$$Q(r) = k r^4$$\n\nThe first task is to derive how a fractional change in radius maps to a fractional change in flow. For infinitesimal changes, this relationship can be found by differentiating the equation. A robust method is to use logarithmic differentiation. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation yields:\n$$\\ln(Q) = \\ln(k r^4) = \\ln(k) + \\ln(r^4) = \\ln(k) + 4 \\ln(r)$$\nNow, we take the differential of the entire expression:\n$$d(\\ln(Q)) = d(\\ln(k) + 4 \\ln(r))$$\n$$\\frac{dQ}{Q} = 0 + 4 \\frac{dr}{r}$$\nThis gives the relationship for infinitesimal fractional changes:\n$$\\frac{dQ}{Q} = 4 \\frac{dr}{r}$$\nThis equation formally demonstrates that the fractional change in cerebral blood flow is four times the fractional change in the arteriole radius. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nThe second task is to compute the fractional change in CBF for a finite change: a decrease in arteriole radius of $10\\%$. Since this is a finite change, using the differential approximation may introduce error. A more exact calculation is required.\n\nLet the initial radius be $r_1$ and the initial CBF be $Q_1$. Let the final radius be $r_2$ and the final CBF be $Q_2$.\nFrom the problem, the radius decreases by $10\\%$. This means:\n$$r_2 = r_1 - 0.10 r_1 = (1 - 0.10) r_1 = 0.90 r_1$$\nThe initial and final flow rates are given by:\n$$Q_1 = k r_1^4$$\n$$Q_2 = k r_2^4$$\nSubstituting the expression for $r_2$:\n$$Q_2 = k (0.90 r_1)^4 = (0.90)^4 k r_1^4 = (0.90)^4 Q_1$$\nThe fractional change in CBF is defined as $\\frac{\\Delta Q}{Q_1} = \\frac{Q_2 - Q_1}{Q_1}$.\nSubstituting the relationship between $Q_2$ and $Q_1$:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta Q}{Q_1} = \\frac{(0.90)^4 Q_1 - Q_1}{Q_1} = (0.90)^4 - 1$$\nWe now compute the numerical value:\n$$(0.90)^4 = 0.9 \\times 0.9 \\times 0.9 \\times 0.9 = (0.81) \\times (0.81) = 0.6561$$\nTherefore, the fractional change in CBF is:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta Q}{Q_1} = 0.6561 - 1 = -0.3439$$\nThis result indicates a $34.39\\%$ decrease in cerebral blood flow. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The value $-0.3439$ already has four significant figures (the digits $3, 4, 3, 9$). Thus, no further rounding is needed.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation, Calculation, and Explanation\nThe solution begins by stating the foundational principles. The Fick principle, as applied to oxygen consumption in the brain, relates the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption ($\\text{CMRO}_2$) to cerebral blood flow ($\\text{CBF}$) and the arteriovenous difference in oxygen content ($C_a\\text{O}_2 - C_v\\text{O}_2$):\n$$\n\\text{CMRO}_2 = \\text{CBF} \\times (C_a\\text{O}_2 - C_v\\text{O}_2)\n$$\n\nThe oxygen extraction fraction ($\\text{OEF}$) is defined as the proportion of oxygen delivered in arterial blood that is extracted and consumed by the tissue:\n$$\n\\text{OEF} = \\frac{C_a\\text{O}_2 - C_v\\text{O}_2}{C_a\\text{O}_2}\n$$\nRearranging this definition allows us to express the arteriovenous oxygen difference in terms of $\\text{OEF}$:\n$$\nC_a\\text{O}_2 - C_v\\text{O}_2 = \\text{OEF} \\times C_a\\text{O}_2\n$$\n\nSubstituting this expression into the Fick principle equation yields the relationship connecting $\\text{CMRO}_2$, $\\text{CBF}$, and $\\text{OEF}$:\n$$\n\\text{CMRO}_2 = \\text{CBF} \\times \\text{OEF} \\times C_a\\text{O}_2\n$$\n\nThe problem describes two states: a baseline state (subscript $_0$) and an ischemic state (subscript $_1$).\nFor the baseline state:\n$$\n\\text{CMRO}_{2,0} = \\text{CBF}_0 \\times \\text{OEF}_0 \\times C_{a,0}\\text{O}_2\n$$\nFor the ischemic state:\n$$\n\\text{CMRO}_{2,1} = \\text{CBF}_1 \\times \\text{OEF}_1 \\times C_{a,1}\\text{O}_2\n$$\n\nThe problem imposes two conditions: $\\text{CMRO}_2$ is maintained at its baseline level ($\\text{CMRO}_{2,1} = \\text{CMRO}_{2,0}$), and arterial oxygen content is constant ($C_{a,1}\\text{O}_2 = C_{a,0}\\text{O}_2 = C_a\\text{O}_2$). By equating the expressions for $\\text{CMRO}_2$ under these conditions, we get:\n$$\n\\text{CBF}_1 \\times \\text{OEF}_1 \\times C_a\\text{O}_2 = \\text{CBF}_0 \\times \\text{OEF}_0 \\times C_a\\text{O}_2\n$$\n\nThe non-zero term $C_a\\text{O}_2$ cancels from both sides, yielding the derived relationship:\n$$\n\\text{CBF}_1 \\times \\text{OEF}_1 = \\text{CBF}_0 \\times \\text{OEF}_0\n$$\nTo find the required $\\text{OEF}$ in the ischemic state ($\\text{OEF}_1$) to maintain the baseline metabolic rate, we solve for $\\text{OEF}_1$:\n$$\n\\text{OEF}_1 = \\text{OEF}_0 \\times \\frac{\\text{CBF}_0}{\\text{CBF}_1}\n$$\nThis expression shows that to compensate for a reduction in flow, $\\text{OEF}$ must increase in inverse proportion.\n\nNext, we calculate the numerical value for $\\text{OEF}_1$ using the given data: $\\text{OEF}_0 = 0.40$, $\\text{CBF}_0 = 50 \\, \\mathrm{mL}/100\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{min}$, and $\\text{CBF}_1 = 15 \\, \\mathrm{mL}/100\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{min}$.\n$$\n\\text{OEF}_1 = 0.40 \\times \\frac{50}{15} = 0.40 \\times \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{4}{10} \\times \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}\n$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$\n\\text{OEF}_1 \\approx 1.3333...\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, the required $\\text{OEF}$ is $1.33$.\n\nFinally, the biophysical explanation for why increasing OEF cannot indefinitely preserve tissue viability is rooted in the physical meaning of OEF. The calculated value of $\\text{OEF}_1 \\approx 1.33$ is a mathematical requirement that is biophysically impossible. The oxygen extraction fraction, being a fraction, cannot exceed a value of $1$, which corresponds to $100\\%$ extraction of all delivered oxygen. An OEF greater than $1$ would violate the principle of conservation of mass. This impossibility reveals the limits of this compensatory mechanism.\n\nThere are two primary constraints:\n1.  **The Absolute Limit of OEF**: The theoretical maximum for $\\text{OEF}$ is $1.0$. When blood flow drops to a level requiring an $\\text{OEF}$ greater than $1.0$ to meet metabolic demand, energy failure is inevitable. In this problem, the critical flow below which metabolism cannot be maintained is $\\text{CBF}_1 = \\text{CBF}_0 \\times \\text{OEF}_0 / 1.0 = 50 \\times 0.40 = 20 \\, \\mathrm{mL}/100\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{min}$. Since the ischemic flow of $15 \\, \\mathrm{mL}/100\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{min}$ is below this threshold, maintaining baseline $\\text{CMRO}_2$ is impossible.\n2.  **Diffusion Limitation**: Oxygen transits from capillaries to mitochondria down a partial pressure gradient. As $\\text{OEF}$ increases toward its limit, the venous oxygen partial pressure ($P_v\\text{O}_2$) plummets towards zero. This severely reduces the driving pressure for oxygen diffusion into the tissue. Even before $\\text{OEF}$ reaches $1.0$, the gradient can become insufficient to supply oxygen to cells farthest from the capillaries, causing localized anoxia and cell death. Thus, the maximum *physiologically effective* $\\text{OEF}$ is always less than $1.0$.\n\nTherefore, as ischemia deepens and CBF falls, the compensatory increase in OEF eventually reaches its biophysical ceiling. Beyond this point, oxygen supply cannot match demand, $\\text{CMRO}_2$ necessarily decreases, and if the ischemic state persists, irreversible tissue damage ensues. The calculated value of $1.33$ starkly demonstrates that the metabolic demands of the tissue have surpassed the maximum possible supply of oxygen under the specified ischemic conditions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.33}\n$$", "id": "4369958"}, {"introduction": "In the clinical management of acute stroke, 'time is brain' because the ischemic penumbra—salvageable tissue at risk—shrinks over time.

We use the given conversion factor: $1\\,\\mathrm{mm}^3 = 0.001\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n$$V_{\\text{mismatch}} = 78.125\\,\\mathrm{mm}^3 \\times \\frac{0.001\\,\\mathrm{mL}}{1\\,\\mathrm{mm}^3} = 0.078125\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nFinally, we round this value to four significant figures. The number is $0.078125$. The first significant digit is $7$. The first four significant digits are $7$, $8$, $1$, and $2$. The fifth significant digit is $5$. According to standard rounding rules, we round up the last significant digit (the fourth one).\n$$0.078125 \\approx 0.07813$$\nThus, the mismatch volume, rounded to four significant figures, is $0.07813\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.07813}$$", "id": "4370007"}]}
