Before ischemia, the neuron is at steady state: adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production by oxidative phosphorylation equals ATP consumption by cellular processes. At time $t=0$, a global cerebral ischemic event causes an abrupt drop in cerebral blood flow (CBF) to a constant fraction of baseline, reducing oxygen delivery and thus oxidative ATP production. Assume that in the short term after the drop, ATP consumption remains at the pre-ischemic steady-state rate until the ATP concentration falls to a critical threshold at which sodium–potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na$^{+}$/K$^{+}$-ATPase) cannot maintain ionic gradients, precipitating membrane failure.\n\nUse the following physiologically plausible parameters:\n- Neuron volume $V = 2.0 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{L}$.\n- Baseline oxygen consumption rate per neuron $r_{\\mathrm{O_2,0}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-16} \\ \\mathrm{mol/s}$.\n- Oxidative phosphorylation yield $y = 5.0$ mol ATP per mol $\\mathrm{O_2}$.\n- Baseline ATP concentration $[\\mathrm{ATP}]_0 = 3.0 \\ \\mathrm{mM}$.\n- Critical ATP concentration for Na$^{+}$/K$^{+}$-ATPase failure $[\\mathrm{ATP}]_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 1.0 \\ \\mathrm{mM}$.\n- Phosphocreatine (PCr) concentration at $t=0$ is $[\\mathrm{PCr}]_0 = 5.0 \\ \\mathrm{mM}$; assume creatine kinase can buffer ATP one-for-one from PCr until PCr is exhausted.\n- At $t=0$, CBF instantaneously falls to a constant fraction $f = 0.15$ of baseline and remains there; assume oxidative ATP production scales linearly with oxygen delivery and that anaerobic glycolysis contributes negligibly over the computed time window.\n\nStarting from conservation of mass for ATP and the steady-state definition, derive and compute the time $T$ from $t=0$ until the ATP concentration first reaches $[\\mathrm{ATP}]_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, taking into account both the drop in oxidative ATP production and the available high-energy phosphate buffer from PCr.

The assumptions, such as negligible anaerobic glycolysis and constant ATP consumption, are explicitly stated simplifications that define a solvable model. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the principle of conservation of energy, specifically applied to the pool of high-energy phosphates (~P) within the neuron. This pool consists of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine (PCr). The creatine kinase reaction, $\\mathrm{PCr} + \\mathrm{ADP} \\leftrightarrow \\mathrm{Cr} + \\mathrm{ATP}$, is extremely rapid. Therefore, PCr acts as a buffer, maintaining the ATP concentration at its baseline level by regenerating it as it is consumed, until the PCr reservoir is depleted. The total time $T$ until the Na$^{+}$/K$^{+}$-ATPase fails can be found by calculating the total available high-energy phosphate supply that can be consumed and dividing it by the net rate of its depletion.\n\nFirst, we establish the baseline steady-state conditions for time $t < 0$. At steady state, the rate of ATP production, $P_{\\mathrm{ATP,0}}$, equals the rate of ATP consumption, $C_{\\mathrm{ATP,0}}$. The problem states that baseline ATP production is entirely due to oxidative phosphorylation.\nThe baseline ATP production rate is given by the product of the oxygen consumption rate, $r_{\\mathrm{O_2,0}}$, and the yield of ATP per mole of oxygen, $y$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{ATP,0}} = y \\cdot r_{\\mathrm{O_2,0}}$$\nAt steady state, this is equal to the baseline consumption rate:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{ATP,0}} = P_{\\mathrm{ATP,0}} = y \\cdot r_{\\mathrm{O_2,0}}$$\nThe problem states that after ischemia begins at $t=0$, this consumption rate remains constant until the critical threshold is reached.\n\nAt $t=0$, the cerebral blood flow (CBF) drops to a fraction $f$ of its baseline value. Consequently, oxygen delivery and the rate of oxidative ATP production also drop to the same fraction of their baseline rates. The new, ischemic ATP production rate, $P_{\\mathrm{ATP,ischemia}}$, is:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{ATP,ischemia}} = f \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{ATP,0}} = f \\cdot y \\cdot r_{\\mathrm{O_2,0}}$$\nThe net rate of depletion of high-energy phosphates is the difference between the constant consumption rate and the reduced production rate:\n$$\\text{Rate of Depletion} = C_{\\mathrm{ATP,0}} - P_{\\mathrm{ATP,ischemia}} = y \\cdot r_{\\mathrm{O_2,0}} - f \\cdot y \\cdot r_{\\mathrm{O_2,0}}$$\n$$\\text{Rate of Depletion} = (1-f) \\cdot y \\cdot r_{\\mathrm{O_2,0}}$$\nThis rate is constant over the time interval of interest.\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount (in moles) of high-energy phosphate bonds, $\\Delta N_{\\sim P}$, that can be depleted before the system reaches the critical state. This total amount is the sum of all available PCr and the permissible drop in ATP.\nThe initial amount of PCr in the neuron volume $V$ is:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{PCr,0}} = [\\mathrm{PCr}]_0 \\cdot V$$\nThe amount of ATP that can be depleted before reaching the critical concentration $[\\mathrm{ATP}]_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ is:\n$$\\Delta N_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = ([\\mathrm{ATP}]_0 - [\\mathrm{ATP}]_{\\mathrm{crit}}) \\cdot V$$\nSince the creatine kinase reaction buffers ATP using PCr, the entire PCr pool must be consumed first, followed by the drop in ATP concentration. The total change in high-energy phosphate moles is the sum of these two quantities:\n$$\\Delta N_{\\sim P} = N_{\\mathrm{PCr,0}} + \\Delta N_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = [\\mathrm{PCr}]_0 \\cdot V + ([\\mathrm{ATP}]_0 - [\\mathrm{ATP}]_{\\mathrm{crit}}) \\cdot V$$\n$$\\Delta N_{\\sim P} = ([\\mathrm{PCr}]_0 + [\\mathrm{ATP}]_0 - [\\mathrm{ATP}]_{\\mathrm{crit}}) \\cdot V$$\n\nThe time $T$ to reach the critical state is the total amount of depletable energy, $\\Delta N_{\\sim P}$, divided by the constant rate of depletion:\n$$T = \\frac{\\Delta N_{\\sim P}}{\\text{Rate of Depletion}} = \\frac{([\\mathrm{PCr}]_0 + [\\mathrm{ATP}]_0 - [\\mathrm{ATP}]_{\\mathrm{crit}}) \\cdot V}{(1-f) \\cdot y \\cdot r_{\\mathrm{O_2,0}}}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $V = 2.0 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{L}$\n- $[\\mathrm{PCr}]_0 = 5.0 \\ \\mathrm{mM} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{mol/L}$\n- $[\\mathrm{ATP}]_0 = 3.0 \\ \\mathrm{mM} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{mol/L}$\n- $[\\mathrm{ATP}]_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 1.0 \\ \\mathrm{mM} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{mol/L}$\n- $f = 0.15$\n- $y = 5.0 \\ \\text{mol ATP/mol O}_2$\n- $r_{\\mathrm{O_2,0}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-16} \\ \\mathrm{mol/s}$\n\nThe total change in concentration is:\n$$\\Delta[\\sim P] = [\\mathrm{PCr}]_0 + [\\mathrm{ATP}]_0 - [\\mathrm{ATP}]_{\\mathrm{crit}} = (5.0 + 3.0 - 1.0) \\ \\mathrm{mM} = 7.0 \\ \\mathrm{mM} = 7.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{mol/L}$$\nThe total depletable moles, $\\Delta N_{\\sim P}$:\n$$\\Delta N_{\\sim P} = (7.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{mol/L}) \\cdot (2.0 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{L}) = 1.4 \\times 10^{-14} \\ \\mathrm{mol}$$\nThe rate of depletion:\n$$\\text{Rate of Depletion} = (1 - 0.15) \\cdot (5.0) \\cdot (4.0 \\times 10^{-16} \\ \\mathrm{mol/s})$$\n$$\\text{Rate of Depletion} = (0.85) \\cdot (2.0 \\times 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{mol/s}) = 1.7 \\times 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{mol/s}$$\nFinally, we compute the time $T$:\n$$T = \\frac{1.4 \\times 10^{-14} \\ \\mathrm{mol}}{1.7 \\times 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{mol/s}} = \\frac{14}{1.7} \\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 8.23529... \\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the time to membrane failure is $T = 8.24 \\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n\nRegarding the sequence of functional failure, neuronal processes are not equally dependent on energy. The $\\text{Na}^+/\\text{K}^+$-ATPase, which maintains the fundamental electrochemical gradients for the resting membrane potential and action potentials, is the single largest consumer of ATP (up to $50-75\\%$ of the total energy budget). Other highly energy-dependent processes include neurotransmitter synthesis, packaging into vesicles, and reuptake from the synaptic cleft. These synaptic processes are critical for neuronal communication. Although the $\\text{Na}^+/\\text{K}^+$-ATPase is vital, its failure represents a terminal event for basic electrical function. Subtle aspects of neuronal function, particularly the ability to sustain high-frequency synaptic transmission, are more immediately sensitive to energy deficits. Therefore, within the interval from $t=0$ to $t=T$, the expected sequence of failure is:\n1. Impairment and failure of high-energy synaptic processes (e.g., neurotransmitter reuptake and recycling), leading to a loss of effective communication between neurons. This would occur relatively early in the interval.\n2. At time $T$, the catastrophic failure of the $\\text{Na}^+/\\text{K}^+$-ATPase occurs because the ATP concentration has fallen to a level ($[\\mathrm{ATP}]_{\\mathrm{crit}}$) insufficient to power it. This leads to a rapid collapse of ion gradients, massive membrane depolarization (anoxic depolarization), and a complete loss of electrical excitability.
