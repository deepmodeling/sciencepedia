It is founded on established principles of biomechanics, specifically the Law of Laplace as applied to cylindrical structures under pressure. The provided data, including arterial pressure ($100$ mmHg), intracranial pressure ($10$ mmHg), aneurysm radii ($r_1 = 3 \\times 10^{-3}$ m, $r_2 = 5 \\times 10^{-3}$ m), and the pressure conversion constant ($1$ mmHg $= 133.322$ Pa), are physiologically plausible and self-consistent. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a unique and meaningful solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe first step is to derive the relationship between wall tension $T$ and the vessel radius $r$ at equilibrium. We model the aneurysm as a thin-walled cylinder of length $L$ and radius $r$. The transmural pressure, $\\Delta P$, is the difference between the internal arterial pressure and the external intracranial pressure. This pressure exerts an outward force on the cylindrical wall.\n\nTo find this force, we consider a conceptual longitudinal cut through the cylinder, dividing it into two halves. The force pushing these two halves apart, $F_{\\text{out}}$, is the product of the transmural pressure $\\Delta P$ and the projected area over which this pressure acts. This projected area is a rectangle of width $2r$ and length $L$.\n$$\nF_{\\text{out}} = \\Delta P \\cdot (2r L)\n$$\nAt equilibrium, this outward force is balanced by an inward force, $F_{\\text{in}}$, generated by the circumferential tension in the vessel wall. Wall tension, $T$, is defined as force per unit length (units of N/m). This tension acts along the two edges of the cut, each of length $L$. The total length over which the tension acts is $2L$. Therefore, the total restraining force is:\n$$\nF_{\\text{in}} = T \\cdot (2L)\n$$\nFor the vessel to be in equilibrium, these forces must be equal:\n$$\nF_{\\text{out}} = F_{\\text{in}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta P \\cdot (2r L) = T \\cdot (2L)\n$$\nDividing both sides by $2L$ yields the Law of Laplace for a cylinder:\n$$\nT = \\Delta P \\cdot r\n$$\nThis equation shows that for a constant transmural pressure $\\Delta P$, the wall tension $T$ is directly proportional to the radius $r$.\n\nNext, we compute the change in wall tension, $\\Delta T$, as the aneurysm dilates from an initial radius $r_1$ to a final radius $r_2$. The wall tensions at these two states, $T_1$ and $T_2$, are given by:\n$$\nT_1 = \\Delta P \\cdot r_1\n$$\n$$\nT_2 = \\Delta P \\cdot r_2\n$$\nThe change in wall tension $\\Delta T$ is the difference between $T_2$ and $T_1$:\n$$\n\\Delta T = T_2 - T_1 = (\\Delta P \\cdot r_2) - (\\Delta P \\cdot r_1) = \\Delta P (r_2 - r_1)\n$$\nNow we can substitute the given numerical values. First, we must calculate the transmural pressure $\\Delta P$ in SI units (Pascals, Pa, or N/m$^2$).\nThe transmural pressure in mmHg is:\n$$\n\\Delta P_{\\text{mmHg}} = \\text{Arterial Pressure} - \\text{Intracranial Pressure} = 100 \\text{ mmHg} - 10 \\text{ mmHg} = 90 \\text{ mmHg}\n$$\nUsing the provided conversion factor, $1 \\text{ mmHg} = 133.322 \\text{ Pa}$:\n$$\n\\Delta P = 90 \\text{ mmHg} \\times \\frac{133.322 \\text{ Pa}}{1 \\text{ mmHg}} = 11998.98 \\text{ Pa}\n$$\nThe given radii are $r_1 = 3 \\times 10^{-3}$ m and $r_2 = 5 \\times 10^{-3}$ m.

The derived relationship $T = \\Delta P \\cdot r$ indicates that as an aneurysm's radius $r$ increases, the tension $T$ in its wall must also increase proportionally to withstand the same internal pressure. Our calculation demonstrates that a relatively small increase in radius (from $3$ mm to $5$ mm) results in a substantial increase in wall tension (approximately $24.0$ N/m). This creates a perilous positive feedback loop: as the aneurysm expands, its wall is stretched and weakened, yet it is simultaneously required to support a greater tension. If the required tension exceeds the mechanical strength of the diseased vascular tissue, the aneurysm will rupture, leading to a catastrophic intracranial hemorrhage. This principle underscores the critical importance of monitoring aneurysm size and the high risk associated with aneurysm growth.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{24.0}$$", "id": "4393963"}, {"introduction": "Once bleeding begins, the cranium becomes a closed system where rising volume leads to a dangerous spike in pressure.

This problem introduces a widely used clinical shortcut, the $ABC/2$ method, for estimating hematoma volume from Computed Tomography (CT) scans.

It is scientifically grounded in standard medical imaging practice and geometric principles, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is expressed in objective, unambiguous language.\n\nThe task is twofold: first, to calculate the volume of an intracerebral hemorrhage using the $ABC/2$ method, and second, to critically analyze the validity and error sources of this approximation.\n\n**Part 1: Volume Calculation**\n\nThe $ABC/2$ method approximates the hematoma volume by modeling it as an ellipsoid. The formula is given by:\n$$V = \\frac{A \\times B \\times C}{2}$$\nwhere $A$, $B$, and $C$ are the orthogonal diameters of the hematoma along its principal axes.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the givens are:\n-   The maximal in-plane length, $A = 5.6 \\, \\text{cm}$.\n-   The maximal in-plane width, perpendicular to $A$, $B = 3.9 \\, \\text{cm}$.\n-   The number of contiguous slices on which the hemorrhage is visible, $N = 12$.\n-   The thickness of each slice, $T = 0.5 \\, \\text{cm}$.\n\nThe dimension $C$ represents the craniocaudal (vertical) extent of the hematoma. It is calculated by multiplying the number of slices by the slice thickness:\n$$C = N \\times T = 12 \\times 0.5 \\, \\text{cm} = 6.0 \\, \\text{cm}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the values of $A$, $B$, and $C$ into the $ABC/2$ formula:\n$$V = \\frac{(5.6 \\, \\text{cm}) \\times (3.9 \\, \\text{cm}) \\times (6.0 \\, \\text{cm})}{2}$$\n$$V = \\frac{131.04 \\, \\text{cm}^3}{2}$$\n$$V = 65.52 \\, \\text{cm}^3$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in milliliters (mL), and it is given that $1 \\, \\text{mL} = 1 \\, \\text{cm}^3$. Therefore, the volume is $65.52 \\, \\text{mL}$. Finally, rounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$V \\approx 65.5 \\, \\text{mL}$$\n\n**Part 2: Critical Analysis of the $ABC/2$ Method**\n\nThe $ABC/2$ formula is a clinical simplification of the geometric formula for the volume of a perfect ellipsoid. The true volume of an ellipsoid with semi-axes $r_a$, $r_b$, and $r_c$ is:\n$$V_{\\text{ellipsoid}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_a r_b r_c$$\nThe measured values $A$, $B$, and $C$ are the full diameters, so $A = 2r_a$, $B = 2r_b$, and $C = 2r_c$. Substituting these into the formula yields:\n$$V_{\\text{ellipsoid}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{A}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{B}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{C}{2}\\right) = \\frac{4\\pi}{24} ABC = \\frac{\\pi}{6} ABC$$\nThe numerical factor is $\\frac{\\pi}{6} \\approx 0.5236$. The $ABC/2$ method replaces this factor with $\\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$. This simplification introduces a small, systematic underestimation of approximately $4.5\\%$ relative to a perfect ellipsoid of the same dimensions, but it allows for rapid mental or calculator-free estimation.\n\nThe validity of the $ABC/2$ approximation rests on one primary assumption: that the hematoma's shape is reasonably approximated by an ellipsoid. The principal sources of systematic error arise when this assumption is violated.\n\n1.  **Shape Irregularity:** This is the most significant source of error. Real-world hematomas are often not smooth, convex ellipsoids. They may be lobulated, have irregular or spiculated margins, or contain concave regions. The $ABC/2$ method uses the *maximal* diameters ($A$, $B$, $C$). This effectively computes the volume of the smallest bounding ellipsoid that can contain the entire hematoma. If the hematoma does not fully occupy this bounding ellipsoid due to an irregular or concave shape, the $ABC/2$ method will systematically **overestimate** the true volume. The \"reasonably smooth margins without obvious multilobulation\" mentioned in the problem statement is a condition aimed at minimizing this specific error source.\n\n2.  **Deviation from Ellipsoidal Form:** Even if a hematoma is regular and convex, its shape may not be ellipsoidal. For example, it might be more cylindrical or box-shaped.\n    -   If the hematoma has a more cylindrical shape (i.e., its cross-sectional area remains nearly constant over its central height before tapering abruptly at the ends), its volume would be closer to that of an elliptical cylinder: $V_{\\text{cylinder}} = (\\text{Area of base}) \\times H = \\left(\\pi \\frac{A}{2} \\frac{B}{2}\\right)C = \\frac{\\pi}{4}ABC \\approx 0.785 ABC$. In this case, the $ABC/2$ formula would significantly **underestimate** the volume.\n    -   Conversely, if the hematoma is more biconical or \"diamond-shaped\" than ellipsoidal, it tapers more sharply from its maximal cross-section. The $ABC/2$ method would likely **overestimate** its volume.\n    The ellipsoidal model represents a specific tapering profile, and deviation from this profile is a source of error.\n\n3.  **Measurement of the Craniocaudal Dimension ($C$):** The calculation $C = N \\times T$ is a discrete approximation of a continuous dimension. This method implicitly assumes that the hematoma fully extends through the entire thickness of the first and last slices on which it is visible. In reality, the hematoma's boundary will likely intersect these slices, occupying only a fraction of their thickness at the superior and inferior poles. This \"partial volume\" effect at the ends of the slice stack causes the calculated dimension $C$ to be an overestimation of the true craniocaudal extent of the hematoma, leading to a systematic **overestimation** of the volume.\n\nIn summary, the $ABC/2$ method is a heuristic whose utility lies in its speed and simplicity in a clinical setting. Its accuracy is limited by its geometric assumptions. The primary error source is shape irregularity, which typically causes overestimation. A secondary error source is the discretization of the vertical dimension $C$, which also tends to cause overestimation. The formula's built-in mathematical simplification (using $1/2$ instead of $\\pi/6$) causes a slight underestimation relative to a perfect ellipsoid, which, by coincidence, may partially offset the overestimation errors in some cases, though this is not a controlled or reliable correction.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{65.5}\n$$", "id": "4393892"}]}
