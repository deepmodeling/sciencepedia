Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows a broad-based dural attachment with a so-called dural tail.

Immunohistochemistry demonstrates the following profile: epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) positive, somatostatin receptor $2$A (SSTR$2$A) positive, progesterone receptor (PR) positive, signal transducer and activator of transcription $6$ (STAT$6$) negative (no nuclear staining), cytokeratin negative, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) negative, and CD$34$ variably positive in a patchy, focal pattern. \n\nUsing the foundational principles that immunohistochemistry detects lineage-defining proteins by antigen–antibody binding and that tumor location and growth pattern reflect cell of origin, select the most likely diagnosis from the options below.

It presents a coherent and scientifically sound clinical vignette, including patient demographics, radiological findings, histological morphology, and a comprehensive immunohistochemical panel. The data are internally consistent and represent a classic case scenario in neuropathology, allowing for a rigorous differential diagnosis. The problem is well-posed, objective, and free from any of the specified flaws.\n\nThe core of the problem is to integrate multiple sources of data—clinical, radiological, histological, and immunohistochemical—to arrive at the most probable diagnosis for a dural-based intracranial mass. The provided information points to a systematic process of elimination based on cell lineage markers and defining molecular pathology.\n\nFirst, we analyze the non-immunohistochemical data. The patient is a $58$-year-old woman. The mass is dural-based and extra-axial, with a \"dural tail\" sign on MRI. Histology shows a well-circumscribed tumor with cells in whorled nests and psammoma bodies. These features collectively are strongly suggestive of a meningioma, and the whorled nests of polygonal cells specifically point to the meningothelial subtype. However, a definitive diagnosis requires ruling out mimics, which is the purpose of the immunohistochemical panel.\n\nNext, we analyze the immunohistochemistry (IHC) results in the context of the main differential diagnoses for a dural-based mass.\n\n1.  **Positive Markers:**\n    *   **Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA) positive:** EMA is a protein typically found in various epithelial cells and is a hallmark of meningiomas, which are derived from meningothelial (arachnoidal cap) cells. Its presence is highly characteristic of meningioma, being positive in over $90\\%$ of cases.\n    *   **Somatostatin Receptor $2$A (SSTR$2$A) positive:** SSTR$2$A is expressed at very high levels in nearly all meningiomas, regardless of subtype or grade. It is an exceptionally sensitive and specific marker. Its positivity provides very strong evidence for a meningioma.\n    *   **Progesterone Receptor (PR) positive:** PR expression is common in meningiomas, particularly in female patients and lower-grade tumors. This finding is entirely consistent with a meningioma in a $58$-year-old woman.\n\n2.  **Negative and Variable Markers (Crucial for Differential Diagnosis):**\n    *   **Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription $6$ (STAT$6$) negative (no nuclear staining):** This is a critical result. The defining molecular event in solitary fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytoma (SFT/HPC) is a *NAB2-STAT6* gene fusion, which results in the aberrant nuclear accumulation of STAT$6$ protein. Nuclear positivity for STAT$6$ is therefore a pathognomonic IHC stain for SFT/HPC. The explicit statement of \"no nuclear staining\" effectively rules out this important differential diagnosis.\n    *   **Cytokeratin negative:** Cytokeratins are intermediate filaments characteristic of epithelial cells. A positive result would strongly suggest a metastatic carcinoma. Its absence is a powerful piece of evidence against a diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma to the dura.\n    *   **Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) negative:** GFAP is the principal intermediate filament protein in glial cells such as astrocytes. An intra-axial glial tumor (e.g., glioblastoma) can sometimes invade the dura and mimic a primary dural mass. A negative GFAP stain excludes a glial origin for the tumor.\n    *   **CD$34$ variably positive in a patchy, focal pattern:** CD$34$ is a cell surface glycoprotein. SFT/HPC is typically characterized by strong, diffuse positivity for CD$34$. While some meningiomas can show focal or weak CD$34$ staining, the \"patchy, focal pattern\" described here, in combination with the negative STAT$6$ result, is not supportive of SFT/HPC and is acceptable for a meningioma.\n\n**Conclusion from Integrated Data:**\nThe combination of clinical presentation, classic radiological and histological findings, and a confirmatory IHC panel (EMA+, SSTR$2$A+, PR+, STAT$6$-, Cytokeratin-, GFAP-) provides overwhelming evidence for a meningioma. The negative stains systematically exclude the most significant mimics.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis:**\n\n- **A. Meningioma (meningothelial type):** All findings are consistent with this diagnosis. The histology (whorled nests of polygonal cells) points to the meningothelial subtype. The IHC profile is classic: positive for meningothelial markers (EMA, SSTR$2$A) and PR, and negative for markers of its key mimics (STAT$6$ for SFT/HPC, Cytokeratin for carcinoma, GFAP for glioma). This is the most likely diagnosis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. Solitary fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytoma of the meninges:** This diagnosis is definitively excluded by the negative nuclear staining for STAT$6$. Nuclear STAT$6$ expression is the sine qua non of SFT/HPC. Furthermore, the histology of SFT/HPC (patternless architecture, staghorn vessels) does not match the described whorls and psammoma bodies.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Metastatic carcinoma to the dura (for example, breast primary):** This diagnosis is excluded by the negative cytokeratin stain. Carcinomas are, by definition, tumors of epithelial origin and express cytokeratins. While a breast primary could be PR positive, the lack of cytokeratin expression is decisive.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Schwannoma:** Schwannomas are $S100$ protein positive and typically EMA negative. The given IHC profile (EMA positive) and histology (whorls, psammoma bodies vs. Antoni A/B patterns with Verocay bodies) are inconsistent with a schwannoma.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **E. Diffuse astrocytoma or glioblastoma with dural involvement:** These are glial tumors and are defined by the expression of GFAP. The negative GFAP stain conclusively rules out this possibility.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4404827"}, {"introduction": "After diagnosing a meningioma, the next vital step is to predict its biological behavior and risk of recurrence.

The provided information consists of standard histopathological features used for the diagnosis and grading of meningiomas.\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based entirely on the WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System, which is the international standard for diagnosing and grading brain tumors. The features described—mitotic rate, brain invasion, necrosis, and specific cytological patterns—are the precise criteria used in this classification system. The values are realistic.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed.

There are no internal contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-defined diagnostic challenge grounded in established medical science. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Correct Grade based on WHO Criteria**\n\nThe grading of meningiomas is based on specific histological criteria defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). The most recent edition (5th edition, 2021) firmly establishes these criteria. Let us analyze the provided findings against the definitions for each grade.\n\n1.  **WHO Grade 1 (Benign) Meningioma:** These tumors lack the features of higher-grade meningiomas. Specifically, they typically have a mitotic index of less than $4$ mitoses per $10$ HPF and do not exhibit brain invasion.\n\n2.  **WHO Grade 2 (Atypical) Meningioma:** The diagnosis of WHO grade $2$ is established if **at least one** of the following criteria is met:\n    *   Elevated mitotic activity, defined as $4$ to $19$ mitoses per $10$ HPF.\n    *   Brain invasion. The presence of tumor cells transgressing the pial-glial basement membrane and infiltrating the underlying brain parenchyma, by itself, is sufficient for a grade $2$ diagnosis, regardless of other features.\n    *   The presence of at least three of the following five \"atypical\" features: spontaneous necrosis, sheeting architecture, prominent nucleoli, high cellularity, or small cells with a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio.\n\n3.  **WHO Grade 3 (Anaplastic/Malignant) Meningioma:** The diagnosis of WHO grade $3$ is made if **at least one** of the following is present:\n    *   Very high mitotic activity, defined as $20$ or more mitoses per $10$ HPF.\n    *   Frank anaplasia, meaning cytological features resembling high-grade carcinoma, sarcoma, or melanoma.\n    *   Specific high-grade histological patterns such as rhabdoid or papillary morphology.\n\n**Application to the Present Case:**\n-   **Mitotic Activity:** The count is $6$ mitoses per $10$ HPF. This value falls squarely within the range of $4-19$ mitoses per $10$ HPF. This finding, on its own, meets a criterion for WHO grade $2$.\n-   **Brain Invasion:** The problem explicitly states that there is \"a small focus of tumor cells infiltrating adjacent brain parenchyma\". Brain invasion is a standalone, definitive criterion for WHO grade $2$.\n-   **WHO Grade 3 Features:** The mitotic count of $6$ is below the threshold of $20$. The problem explicitly rules out anaplastic cytology (\"no overt carcinoma-like or sarcomatous cytologic features\") and specific high-grade patterns (\"no rhabdoid or papillary morphology\"). Therefore, the tumor cannot be WHO grade $3$.\n\n**Conclusion:** This tumor possesses two independent features, either of which is sufficient to assign a diagnosis of WHO grade $2$ (atypical meningioma): (1) a mitotic index of $6$ per $10$ HPF and (2) the presence of brain invasion. The presence of both features reinforces this grade assignment.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. WHO grade $1$ (benign meningioma)**\nThis option is incorrect. A WHO grade $1$ meningioma requires a mitotic index below $4$ per $10$ HPF and the absence of brain invasion. The described tumor has a mitotic index of $6$ per $10$ HPF and shows brain invasion.\n*Verdict: **Incorrect**.*\n\n**B. WHO grade $2$ (atypical meningioma)**\nThis option is correct. The tumor meets the criteria for WHO grade $2$ on two separate counts: its mitotic index is $6$ per $10$ HPF (within the $4-19$ range), and it exhibits brain invasion. The presence of either one of these features is sufficient for this grade.\n*Verdict: **Correct**.*\n\n**C. WHO grade $3$ (anaplastic meningioma)**\nThis option is incorrect. The mitotic index of $6$ per $10$ HPF is well below the threshold of $20$ per $10$ HPF required for grade $3$ based on mitotic activity. Furthermore, overt anaplasia and other high-grade morphologies are explicitly stated to be absent.\n*Verdict: **Incorrect**.*\n\n**D. Not gradable without a proliferation index ($Ki-67$) result**\nThis option is incorrect. The proliferation index $Ki-67$ (also known as $MIB-1$) is an ancillary immunohistochemical stain that correlates with grade and recurrence risk but is not a primary diagnostic or grading criterion in the WHO classification system for meningiomas. The grade is determined by the histomorphological features (mitotic count, invasion, cytology, necrosis) already provided. The provided data are sufficient for grading.\n*Verdict: **Incorrect**.*\n\n**E. WHO grade $2$ only if both increased mitotic activity and brain invasion are present together; otherwise WHO grade $1**\nThis option is incorrect. This statement misrepresents the WHO grading criteria. Both increased mitotic activity ($4-19$ per $10$ HPF) and brain invasion are independent, standalone criteria for WHO grade $2$. The presence of either one is sufficient to upgrade a meningioma from grade $1$ to grade $2$. It is not necessary for them to occur concurrently.\n*Verdict: **Incorrect**.*", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4404928"}, {"introduction": "Beyond a basic diagnosis and grade, pathologists must recognize specific histological variants of meningioma, which can have unique features and diagnostic pitfalls.

They are known as hyaline inclusions or pseudopsammoma bodies. Their description as being within intracytoplasmic and intercellular lumina is accurate.\n    -   The special stain results for these globules (PAS-positive, diastase-resistant) correctly identify them as being composed of glycoproteins, not glycogen.\n    -   The IHC profile of the tumor cells (vimentin-positive, EMA-positive, cytokeratin-negative cytoplasm) is the classic immunophenotype of meningothelial cells.\n    -   The IHC profile of the luminal secretions (strong positivity for CEA and cytokeratins) is the defining, albeit paradoxical, feature of secretory meningioma.\n    -   The description of \"concentrically laminated, basophilic, extracellular calcified structures\" is the textbook definition of **psammoma bodies**, which are frequently found in various types of meningioma.\n    -   The entire description is factually sound and aligns perfectly with established principles of neuropathology.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed.

There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It represents a standard, high-quality question in the field of pathology. I will now proceed to the solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem presents two distinct microscopic structures within a meningioma and asks for their correct identification, contrast, and an explanation of the associated immunohistochemical findings.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the \"Eosinophilic Globules\"**:\n    -   **Morphology**: These are described as round, eosinophilic globules within intracytoplasmic and intercellular lumina formed by the tumor cells. This points to a secretory process.\n    -   **Histochemistry**: They are PAS-positive and diastase-resistant. PAS stains carbohydrates, including glycogen, glycoproteins, and mucins. Resistance to diastase (an enzyme that digests glycogen) proves the substance is not glycogen, but rather a complex carbohydrate like a glycoprotein.\n    -   **Immunohistochemistry**: The globules and the apical cell membranes lining the lumina are strongly positive for CEA and pan-cytokeratin. This indicates the secreted material is composed of these epithelial-type proteins. These structures are known as **pseudopsammoma bodies** or secretory bodies.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the \"Concentric Calcified Structures\"**:\n    -   **Morphology**: These are described as extracellular, concentrically laminated, and basophilic (due to calcium salts). This is the classic definition of a **true psammoma body**. They represent foci of dystrophic calcification that arise from degenerated and mineralized tumor cells or thrombosed vessels. Being calcified mineral deposits, they are biochemically distinct from the glycoproteinaceous secretory globules. They are not expected to be specifically positive for PAS, CEA, or cytokeratin, though nonspecific staining can sometimes occur.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Immunohistochemical Paradox**:\n    -   **The Paradox**: The tumor cells' cytoplasm is negative for cytokeratin, yet the material they secrete into the lumina is strongly positive for cytokeratin.\n    -   **The Explanation**: This is a hallmark of the specialized differentiation in secretory meningioma. The meningothelial cells, which normally express vimentin as their primary intermediate filament and are thus cytokeratin-negative in their cytoplasm, undergo a form of `apical epithelial/glandular differentiation`. They synthesize epithelial-associated proteins (like CEA and cytokeratin molecules) and secrete them from their apical surface into the microlumina. These secreted proteins accumulate and become highly concentrated in the lumen, resulting in strong IHC positivity. However, the cells do not assemble these cytokeratin proteins into a stable cytoskeletal network of intermediate filaments throughout their cytoplasm, which is why the cytoplasm remains negative. This is a well-documented phenomenon and is considered a specific type of differentiation, not a staining artifact or an indication of a different cell type.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n-   **A. The globules are intracytoplasmic proteinaceous secretions within microlumina that are PAS-positive, diastase-resistant, and immunoreactive for CEA and cytokeratin when staining is confined to luminal material; true psammoma bodies are extracellular, concentrically laminated calcifications that are negative for PAS and for CEA/cytokeratin. The apparent cytokeratin/CEA positivity reflects apical secretory differentiation with concentration of epithelial-type glycoproteins in the lumen, while the tumor cell cytoskeleton remains cytokeratin-negative.**\n    -   This option correctly identifies the globules as secretory products with the specified staining characteristics. It correctly identifies the psammoma bodies as extracellular calcifications and accurately contrasts their expected staining. Crucially, it provides the correct and accepted explanation for the IHC paradox, citing apical secretory differentiation.\n    -   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **B. The globules represent early mineralization precursors of psammoma bodies and are therefore von Kossa-positive and PAS-negative; cytokeratin positivity in the lumina demonstrates that the meningioma cells themselves are cytokeratin-positive and of epithelial origin.**\n    -   This statement is incorrect on multiple fronts. The globules are glycoproteinaceous secretions, not mineralized precursors of psammoma bodies. The problem states they are PAS-positive, not PAS-negative. The conclusion that the meningioma cells are cytokeratin-positive directly contradicts the provided data (\"tumor cell cytoplasm is negative for cytokeratin\").\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C. The globules are extracellular mucin pools formed by necrosis, whereas psammoma bodies are intracellular calcifications; cytokeratin/CEA positivity indicates metastasis of an adenocarcinoma colonizing the meningioma.**\n    -   This statement is factually wrong. The globules are described as intracytoplasmic/intercellular lumina, not necrotic pools. Psammoma bodies are extracellular, not intracellular. The hypothesis of a metastatic adenocarcinoma is inconsistent with the overall picture of a primary meningioma (whorls, EMA+/vimentin+ tumor cells).\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. The globules are intracytoplasmic secretory lumina that are Alcian blue-positive and CEA-positive but cytokeratin-negative; psammoma bodies are laminated calcifications that are also CEA-positive due to adsorption. The paradoxical staining arises because meningioma cells aberrantly express cytokeratin intermediate filaments throughout their cytoplasm.**\n    -   This option contains several errors. The globules in secretory meningioma are classically PAS-positive, not Alcian blue-positive (which stains for acidic mucins). It incorrectly states the globules are cytokeratin-negative, contradicting the prompt. The explanation for the \"paradox\" is also incorrect, as it claims the tumor cells express cytokeratin filaments throughout the cytoplasm, which again contradicts the prompt's data.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **E. The globules are intracytoplasmic lumina with eosinophilic secretions that are PAS-positive and CEA-positive; psammoma bodies are extracellular calcifications. The cytokeratin/CEA positivity in lumina is due solely to nonspecific trapping of serum proteins during fixation and does not reflect tumor differentiation.**\n    -   While nonspecific protein trapping can be an artifact in IHC, it is not the explanation for the strong, specific, and defining staining pattern seen in secretory meningioma. The co-expression of CEA and cytokeratin in these globules is a reliable and well-characterized feature that reflects a specific pathway of tumor cell differentiation, not a random artifact.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4404892"}]}
