This exercise provides a foundational hands-on opportunity to apply this rule. By using exon phase information—a key concept in bioinformatics—you will predict the molecular consequence of a multi-exon deletion and, in turn, its likely clinical phenotype [@problem_id:4499889].", "problem": "A patient presents with a confirmed multi-exon deletion in the dystrophin gene: a contiguous deletion of exons $45$ through $47$ on the protein-coding transcript of the dystrophin gene. You are asked to determine whether the resulting messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) maintains the original reading frame across the novel exon junction created by splicing exon $44$ directly to exon $48$, and from this infer the likely phenotype according to the reading-frame rule (in-frame tends to yield Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD); out-of-frame tends to yield Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)).\n\nUse the following foundational definitions rooted in the Central Dogma of molecular biology and the convention of intron phase in eukaryotic splicing:\n- Protein translation reads codons in sets of $3$ nucleotides; a frameshift changes the grouping and thus the encoded amino acid sequence downstream.\n- For any exon $i$, define the left splice phase $p_{L}(i) \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$ as the number of nucleotides of a codon present at the exon’s $5^{\\prime}$ end before the splice acceptor site, and the right splice phase $p_{R}(i) \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$ as the number of nucleotides of a codon present at the exon’s $3^{\\prime}$ end before the splice donor site. By convention, $p=0$ indicates that the splice occurs between codons.\n\nAssume the curated exon-phase annotation for the human dystrophin transcript is as follows in the relevant interval:\n- Exon $44$: $p_{L}(44)=0$, $p_{R}(44)=0$.\n- Exon $45$: $p_{L}(45)=0$, $p_{R}(45)=0$.\n- Exon $46$: $p_{L}(46)=0$, $p_{R}(46)=0$.\n- Exon $47$: $p_{L}(47)=0$, $p_{R}(47)=0$.\n- Exon $48$: $p_{L}(48)=0$, $p_{R}(48)=0$.\n\nStarting from these definitions, compute the net reading-frame offset modulo $3$ induced at the novel junction created by directly splicing exon $44$ to exon $48$ after deletion of exons $45$–$47$. Denote this offset by $k \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$, where $k=0$ indicates that the reading frame is preserved at the junction, and $k \\in \\{1,2\\}$ indicates a frameshift at the junction.

The use of exon phases is a standard concept in bioinformatics, and the provided phase values for the specified human dystrophin exons are factually correct according to genomic databases.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly stated, provides all necessary data and definitions, and asks for a single, calculable integer value, $k$.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem uses precise, technical language and is free of any subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Verdict**: The problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 3: Solution\nThe problem requires the calculation of the reading-frame offset, $k$, resulting from the deletion of exons $45$, $46$, and $47$. This offset is determined by the total number of nucleotides removed from the coding sequence, modulo $3$. A frameshift occurs if this number is not a multiple of $3$.\n\nLet $L(i)$ be the length in nucleotides of exon $i$. The total length of the deleted segment is $L_{del} = L(45) + L(46) + L(47)$. The reading frame for the sequence downstream of the deletion is shifted by an amount equal to the negative of the deleted length, modulo $3$. Therefore, the offset $k$ is given by:\n$$k = (-L_{del}) \\pmod 3$$\n\nTo find $L_{del} \\pmod 3$, we must first determine the length of each deleted exon modulo $3$. The length of any given exon $i$, $L(i)$, is constrained by its left (entry) and right (exit) splice phases, $p_L(i)$ and $p_R(i)$. For an exon to be a valid component of a continuous reading frame, the number of nucleotides it contains must be consistent with the phases of its flanking introns. This relationship can be expressed as:\n$$(L(i) + p_L(i) - p_R(i)) \\pmod 3 = 0$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to find the length of the exon modulo $3$:\n$$L(i) \\pmod 3 = (p_R(i) - p_L(i)) \\pmod 3$$\n\nWe apply this formula to each of the three deleted exons using the provided phase data.\n\nFor exon $45$:\n$$L(45) \\pmod 3 = (p_R(45) - p_L(45)) \\pmod 3 = (0 - 0) \\pmod 3 = 0$$\n\nFor exon $46$:\n$$L(46) \\pmod 3 = (p_R(46) - p_L(46)) \\pmod 3 = (0 - 0) \\pmod 3 = 0$$\n\nFor exon $47$:\n$$L(47) \\pmod 3 = (p_R(47) - p_L(47)) \\pmod 3 = (0 - 0) \\pmod 3 = 0$$\n\nNow, we can compute the total length of the deleted segment modulo $3$:\n$$L_{del} \\pmod 3 = (L(45) + L(46) + L(47)) \\pmod 3$$\n$$L_{del} \\pmod 3 = ( (L(45) \\pmod 3) + (L(46) \\pmod 3) + (L(47) \\pmod 3) ) \\pmod 3$$\n$$L_{del} \\pmod 3 = (0 + 0 + 0) \\pmod 3 = 0$$\n\nThe total number of deleted nucleotides is a multiple of $3$. The resulting reading-frame offset $k$ is therefore:\n$$k = (-L_{del}) \\pmod 3 = (-0) \\pmod 3 = 0$$\n\nAn alternative, equivalent method is to consider the phases at the boundaries of the new junction directly. In the modified transcript, exon $44$ is spliced to exon $48$. The reading frame is maintained if the exit phase of the upstream exon ($p_R(44)$) is identical to the entry phase of the downstream exon ($p_L(48)$). The offset $k$ can be calculated as the difference between the frame provided by the upstream sequence and the frame expected by the downstream sequence:\n$$k = (p_R(\\text{upstream}) - p_L(\\text{downstream})) \\pmod 3$$\nIn this case, the upstream exon is $44$ and the downstream exon is $48$:\n$$k = (p_R(44) - p_L(48)) \\pmod 3$$\nUsing the provided data, $p_R(44) = 0$ and $p_L(48) = 0$. Substituting these values into the equation:\n$$k = (0 - 0) \\pmod 3 = 0$$\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, $k=0$. This indicates that the reading frame is preserved across the novel exon $44-48$ junction. According to the reading-frame rule provided, this in-frame deletion is predictive of a Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) phenotype rather than a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) phenotype.\n\nThe final answer is the integer value of the offset $k$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "4499889"}, {"introduction": "Building on the reading-frame rule, this problem delves into the logic behind modern therapeutic strategies like exon skipping. Understanding how specific deletions disrupt the genetic code allows scientists to design antisense oligonucleotides that can restore the reading frame, potentially converting a severe Duchenne phenotype into a milder Becker-like one. This practice challenges you to evaluate the viability of such a therapeutic intervention by calculating its effect on both the reading frame and the final protein structure [@problem_id:4359997].", "problem": "A single-gene disorder of muscle fibers arises from mutations in the dystrophin gene, producing either Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) or Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Use the following fundamental bases: the Central Dogma of molecular biology (deoxyribonucleic acid to messenger ribonucleic acid to protein), the triplet nature of the genetic code (codons of $3$ nucleotides), and the rule that reading frame at an exon-exon junction depends on the splice site \"phase\": the number of nucleotides within a codon at the splice boundary. For a splice between an upstream exon with $3'$ donor phase $a$ and a downstream exon with $5'$ acceptor phase $b$, the reading frame is preserved if and only if $a + b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nConsider a patient with a genomic deletion spanning dystrophin gene exons $48$-$50$. This deletion causes messenger ribonucleic acid splicing to join exon $47$ directly to exon $51$. Therapeutic antisense oligonucleotide-mediated exon skipping is proposed to skip exon $51$, instead joining exon $47$ directly to exon $52$. You are given the following splice site phases for this dystrophin gene region:\n- Exon $47$ $3'$ donor phase: $2$.\n- Exon $51$ $5'$ acceptor phase: $2$.\n- Exon $52$ $5'$ acceptor phase: $1$.\n\nAdditionally, consider the domain architecture of full-length dystrophin $427$ kilodalton isoform (Dp427). Dp427 has an N-terminal actin-binding domain, a central rod domain composed of $24$ spectrin-like repeats and interspersed hinges, a cysteine-rich domain, and a C-terminal domain. For the purposes of this problem, assume that exons $48$-$51$ collectively encode spectrin-like repeats $18$ and $19$ and the third hinge (H3) within the central rod domain.\n\nDefine an indicator variable $I$ that equals $1$ if exon $51$ skipping restores the reading frame for the deletion spanning exons $48$-$50$, and equals $0$ otherwise. Define $f$ as the fraction of spectrin-like repeats retained in the central rod domain after removal of exons $48$-$51$, relative to the $24$ repeats of full-length Dp427. Compute the product $M = I \\times f$ and express it as a unitless decimal, rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the computation of a product $M = I \\times f$, where $I$ is an indicator variable for the restoration of the genetic reading frame by a therapeutic intervention, and $f$ is the fraction of retained structural repeats in the resulting protein. The context is a patient with a specific deletion in the dystrophin gene.\n\nFirst, we must determine the value of the indicator variable, $I$. This variable is defined to be $1$ if the therapeutic skipping of exon $51$ restores the reading frame that was disrupted by the initial deletion of exons $48$-$50$, and $0$ otherwise. The rule for preserving the reading frame across a splice junction is that the sum of the $3'$ donor phase of the upstream exon ($a$) and the $5'$ acceptor phase of the downstream exon ($b$) must be a multiple of $3$. This can be expressed as the congruence relation $a + b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nLet us analyze the initial state of the patient, who has a genomic deletion spanning exons $48$ through $50$. This deletion results in the splicing of exon $47$ directly to exon $51$.\nFor this splice junction:\n- The upstream exon is exon $47$, which has a $3'$ donor phase given as $a = 2$.\n- The downstream exon is exon $51$, which has a $5'$ acceptor phase given as $b = 2$.\n\nWe compute the sum of these phases:\n$a + b = 2 + 2 = 4$.\nTo check if the reading frame is preserved, we evaluate this sum modulo $3$:\n$4 \\pmod{3} \\equiv 1$.\nSince $1 \\not\\equiv 0$, the reading frame is disrupted. This is a frameshift mutation, which typically leads to a premature stop codon and a truncated, non-functional protein, characteristic of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).\n\nNext, we analyze the effect of the proposed therapeutic intervention: antisense oligonucleotide-mediated skipping of exon $51$. In this scenario, with the original deletion of exons $48$-$50$ still present, skipping exon $51$ causes exon $47$ to be spliced directly to exon $52$.\nFor this new therapeutic splice junction:\n- The upstream exon remains exon $47$, with its $3'$ donor phase $a = 2$.\n- The new downstream exon is exon $52$, which has a $5'$ acceptor phase given as $b = 1$.\n\nWe compute the sum of these new phases:\n$a + b = 2 + 1 = 3$.\nWe evaluate this sum modulo $3$:\n$3 \\pmod{3} \\equiv 0$.\nSince the sum is congruent to $0 \\pmod{3}$, the reading frame is preserved. This therapeutic intervention converts a frameshift mutation into an in-frame deletion, allowing for the production of a shorter but potentially partially functional protein, which is characteristic of the milder Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) phenotype.\n\nThe indicator variable $I$ is $1$ if the therapy restores the reading frame. Our analysis shows the initial state has a disrupted frame ($a+b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$) and the therapeutic state has a preserved frame ($a+b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$). Therefore, the therapy does restore the reading frame.\nThus, $I = 1$.\n\nSecond, we must calculate the variable $f$. This is a unitless fraction representing the portion of spectrin-like repeats retained in the central rod domain of the dystrophin protein after the total removal of exons $48$ through $51$.\nThe full-length dystrophin protein (Dp427) contains a total of $N_{total} = 24$ spectrin-like repeats.\nThe problem states that exons $48$-$51$ collectively encode for spectrin-like repeats $18$ and $19$. This means the number of repeats removed, $N_{removed}$, is $2$.\nThe number of spectrin-like repeats retained in the modified protein is:\n$N_{retained} = N_{total} - N_{removed} = 24 - 2 = 22$.\n\nThe fraction $f$ of retained repeats is the ratio of the number of retained repeats to the total number of repeats in the full-length protein:\n$$f = \\frac{N_{retained}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{22}{24}$$\nThis fraction can be simplified to:\n$$f = \\frac{11}{12}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the product $M = I \\times f$:\n$$M = 1 \\times \\frac{11}{12} = \\frac{11}{12}$$\nThe problem requires this value to be expressed as a unitless decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$M = \\frac{11}{12} \\approx 0.916666...$$\nRounding this to four significant figures, we look at the fifth significant figure.
