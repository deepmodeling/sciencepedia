There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any invalidating flaws. It is scientifically sound, complete, consistent, and unambiguous.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Ellipsoid Volume Formula\nThe derivation proceeds from the given formula for the volume of a sphere, $V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3}$, using the principle of linear scaling. A sphere is a special case of an ellipsoid where all three semi-axes are equal, i.e., $a=b=c=r$. We can conceptualize the transformation of a sphere into a general ellipsoid as a sequence of three independent scaling operations along three orthogonal axes.\n\nLet us start with a sphere of radius $r$. Its volume is $V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.\n\n1.  **First Scaling (x-axis):** We scale the sphere along one axis, say the $x$-axis, by a factor of $\\frac{a}{r}$. This transforms the sphere into a spheroid (a specific type of ellipsoid) with semi-axes $a$, $r$, and $r$. A fundamental principle of geometry states that if a solid is stretched along one dimension by a factor $k$, its volume is also multiplied by the factor $k$. Therefore, the volume of this new shape, $V_1$, is:\n    $$V_1 = V_{\\text{sphere}} \\times \\left(\\frac{a}{r}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\right) \\frac{a}{r} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a r^2$$\n\n2.  **Second Scaling (y-axis):** Next, we scale the resulting spheroid along a second orthogonal axis, the $y$-axis, by a factor of $\\frac{b}{r}$. This transforms the spheroid into an ellipsoid with semi-axes $a$, $b$, and $r$. The volume, $V_2$, is scaled accordingly:\n    $$V_2 = V_1 \\times \\left(\\frac{b}{r}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi a r^2\\right) \\frac{b}{r} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a b r$$\n\n3.  **Third Scaling (z-axis):** Finally, we scale this second ellipsoid along the third orthogonal axis, the $z$-axis, by a factor of $\\frac{c}{r}$. This produces the general ellipsoid with semi-axes $a$, $b$, and $c$. Its volume, $V_{\\text{ellipsoid}}$, is:\n    $$V_{\\text{ellipsoid}} = V_2 \\times \\left(\\frac{c}{r}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi a b r\\right) \\frac{c}{r} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a b c$$\n\nThis completes the derivation. The analytic expression for the volume of an ellipsoid with semi-axes $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi abc$.\n\n### Calculation of the Lesion Volume\nThe problem provides the maximal diameters of the lesion along three orthogonal axes:\n- Anteroposterior diameter, $d_a = 6.6$ cm\n- Mediolateral diameter, $d_b = 5.2$ cm\n- Craniocaudal diameter, $d_c = 4.4$ cm\n\nThe corresponding semi-axes are half of these diameters:\n- $a = \\frac{d_a}{2} = \\frac{6.6 \\text{ cm}}{2} = 3.3 \\text{ cm}$\n- $b = \\frac{d_b}{2} = \\frac{5.2 \\text{ cm}}{2} = 2.6 \\text{ cm}$\n- $c = \\frac{d_c}{2} = \\frac{4.4 \\text{ cm}}{2} = 2.2 \\text{ cm}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived volume formula:\n$$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a b c$$\n$$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi(3.3 \\text{ cm})(2.6 \\text{ cm})(2.2 \\text{ cm})$$\n\nFirst, we compute the product of the semi-axes:\n$$abc = (3.3)(2.6)(2.2) \\text{ cm}^3 = 18.876 \\text{ cm}^3$$\n\nNow, we calculate the volume:\n$$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (18.876) \\text{ cm}^3 \\approx 79.066860... \\text{ cm}^3$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in milliliters (mL), using the equivalence $1$ cm$^{3} = 1$ mL. Thus, the volume is:\n$$V \\approx 79.066860... \\text{ mL}$$\n\nFinally, we round the result to four significant figures. The first four significant digits are $7$, $9$, $0$, and $6$. The fifth digit is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant digit.\n$$V \\approx 79.07 \\text{ mL}$$\n\nThis value represents the estimated volume of the lesion, which corresponds to the volume of PMMA required to fill the cavity after curettage.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{79.07}\n$$", "id": "4374420"}, {"introduction": "Accurate diagnosis is the cornerstone of pathology, but morphologic mimics can pose a significant challenge.

The $H3.3$ $K36M$ mutation acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of histone methyltransferases (e.g., SETD2), leading to a global loss of $H3K36$ di- and tri-methylation. The $H3.3$ $G34W$ mutation has a different, *cis*-acting mechanism, where the bulky tryptophan residue locally blocks methylation of the adjacent $K36$ residue, leading to aberrant gene expression, including the upregulation of $RANKL$.\n    *   The use of mutation-specific IHC, such as an anti-$H3$ $K36M$ antibody, is a standard and valuable diagnostic tool in surgical pathology for identifying tumors with this specific mutation.\n    *   The fundamental principles provided (Central Dogma, chromatin regulation) are core biological concepts.\n\n3.  **Well-Posed and Objective:** The problem is well-posed, asking for the best explanation among a set of choices.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and based on established facts in bone pathology and molecular oncology.\n*   **Action:** Proceed to derive the solution and evaluate the options.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires a two-part analysis: predicting the IHC staining pattern and explaining the molecular basis for the different tumor phenotypes.\n\n1.  **Tumor Identification and Neoplastic Cell Population:**\n    *   Case $1$ is chondroblastoma. The neoplastic cells are the mononuclear chondroblasts.\n    *   Case $2$ is giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB). The neoplastic cells are the mononuclear stromal cells. The osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells are non-neoplastic, reactive cells recruited by signals from the neoplastic stromal cells.\n\n2.  **Genetic and Epigenetic Correlation:**\n    *   **Chondroblastoma:** Approximately $95\\%$ of cases are driven by a somatic mutation in the $H3F3B$ gene, which encodes the histone variant $H3.3$. The most common mutation results in a lysine-to-methionine substitution at position $36$ ($K36M$). Therefore, the neoplastic mononuclear cells in chondroblastoma will express the $H3.3$ $K36M$ mutant protein.\n    *   **Giant Cell Tumor of Bone (GCTB):** Approximately $80-95\\%$ of cases are driven by a somatic mutation in the $H3F3A$ gene, which also encodes the histone variant $H3.3$. The characteristic mutation is a glycine-to-tryptophan substitution at position $34$ ($G34W$). This mutation is present in the neoplastic mononuclear stromal cells but *not* in the reactive giant cells. A minority of GCTB, often those with malignant transformation, can have other mutations, including $K36M$, but the canonical GCTB has the $G34W$ mutation.\n\n3.  **Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Application:**\n    *   An antibody specific to the $H3$ $K36M$ neoepitope will bind to the mutant protein.\n    *   Consequently, IHC for $H3$ $K36M$ will show strong, specific **nuclear staining in the neoplastic mononuclear cells of chondroblastoma**.\n    *   In a typical $G34W$-mutated GCTB, there is no $K36M$ mutant protein. Therefore, **IHC for $H3$ $K36M$ will be negative** in all cell populations of a GCTB. This IHC stain is therefore an excellent tool to distinguish chondroblastoma from GCTB.\n\n4.  **Pathophysiological Mechanisms:**\n    *   **Chondroblastoma ($H3F3B$ $K36M$):** The $H3.3$ $K36M$ protein integrates into chromatin and acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of methyltransferases responsible for $H3K36$ methylation (e.g., SETD2, NSD1/2). This leads to a global reduction in $H3K36$ di- and tri-methylation. This altered epigenetic state dysregulates transcription, blocking the normal differentiation pathway of chondrocytes and trapping the cells in an immature, proliferative chondroblastic state, which defines the tumor's phenotype.\n    *   **GCTB ($H3F3A$ $G34W$):** The $H3.3$ $G34W$ mutation in the neoplastic stromal cells causes a local, *cis*-acting steric hindrance that prevents the methylation of the adjacent lysine $36$ ($K36$) on the same histone tail. This localized epigenetic alteration leads to a specific change in gene expression, most notably the marked upregulation of the gene encoding **$RANKL$** (Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor Kappa-B Ligand, also known as $TNFSF11$). The neoplastic stromal cells secrete $RANKL$, which recruits and stimulates the differentiation and fusion of non-neoplastic osteoclast precursors into the large, multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells that are characteristic of the tumor and are responsible for its bone-resorbing (lytic) activity.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. H3 K36M IHC shows strong nuclear staining in the neoplastic mononuclear cells of chondroblastoma but is negative in giant cell tumor of bone; chondroblastoma harbors an *H3F3B* K36M mutation that acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of H3K36 methylation, skewing gene expression toward an immature chondroblastic program, whereas giant cell tumor of bone harbors an *H3F3A* G34W mutation in mononuclear stromal cells that alters chromatin at H3K36-regulated loci and upregulates $RANKL$, recruiting osteoclast-like giant cells.**\n    *   This option correctly describes the IHC staining pattern: positive in chondroblastoma mononuclear cells and negative in GCTB. It correctly identifies the gene (*H3F3B*) and mutation ($K36M$) in chondroblastoma and accurately describes its dominant-negative mechanism and phenotypic consequence (immature chondroblastic program). It also correctly identifies the gene (*H3F3A*), mutation ($G34W$), neoplastic cell type (mononuclear stromal cells), and key pathogenetic consequence ($RANKL$ upregulation and giant cell recruitment) in GCTB. Every component of this statement is accurate and aligns with the derived solution.\n    *   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. H3 K36M IHC highlights osteoclast-like giant cells in giant cell tumor of bone because these are the neoplastic cells expressing H3 K36M; chondroblastoma is negative because its mutation increases H3K36 methylation, promoting terminal chondrocyte differentiation.**\n    *   This statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. In GCTB, the giant cells are non-neoplastic, and the typical mutation is $G34W$, not $K36M$. In chondroblastoma, $H3K36M$ IHC is positive, and the mutation *decreases*, not increases, $H3K36$ methylation, *blocking* differentiation.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Both lesions show diffuse positivity for H3 K36M IHC because H3K36 methylation is universally increased in bone tumors with osteoclast recruitment; the shared histone change explains why both produce multinucleated giant cells.**\n    *   This statement is incorrect. GCTB is typically negative for $H3K36M$ IHC. The $K36M$ mutation *decreases*, not increases, methylation. The mutations and mechanisms in the two tumors are distinct, not shared.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Giant cell tumor of bone is positive for H3 K36M IHC due to an *H3F3A* K36M mutation, and chondroblastoma is positive for H3 G34W IHC due to an *H3F3B* G34W mutation; these mutations similarly enhance H3K36 methylation, promoting osteoid and cartilage production, respectively.**\n    *   This statement swaps the characteristic mutations between the tumors. GCTB is associated with $H3F3A$ $G34W$, and chondroblastoma with $H3F3B$ $K36M$. It also incorrectly claims the mutations *enhance* methylation.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. H3 K36M IHC is positive in chondroblastoma, but the multinucleated giant cells in giant cell tumor of bone are the neoplastic population harboring *H3F3A* mutations; the chondroblast phenotype in chondroblastoma is driven by increased H3K27 methylation secondary to $K36M$ that promotes terminal chondrocyte maturation.**\n    *   This statement is incorrect. It rightly states $H3K36M$ IHC is positive in chondroblastoma, but wrongly identifies the giant cells in GCTB as the neoplastic population. While loss of $H3K36$ methylation can lead to a secondary increase in $H3K27$ methylation, this process is associated with gene repression and a *block* in differentiation, not the promotion of terminal maturation.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4374393"}, {"introduction": "The advent of targeted therapies has revolutionized oncology, but it also creates new challenges for pathological assessment.

The patient receives $6$ months of therapy with an anti–Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor kappa-B Ligand (RANKL) monoclonal antibody (denosumab) and undergoes curettage. The post-therapy specimen shows abundant irregular trabeculae of woven bone, markedly reduced numbers of giant cells, and a residual population of bland mononuclear stromal cells. \n\nUsing fundamental bone biology, recall that osteoclast differentiation and activation require RANKL binding to Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor kappa-B (RANK) on osteoclast precursors, and that osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and osteoblast-mediated bone formation are coupled processes in normal remodeling. Based on these principles, choose the option that best explains the mechanism underlying the observed histologic changes after denosumab and outlines key pitfalls in interpretation of post-therapy biopsies for giant cell tumor of bone.\n\nA. Denosumab binds RANKL, preventing RANK activation on osteoclast precursors, which reduces osteoclastogenesis and diminishes osteoclast-like giant cells. Reduced resorption shifts the local remodeling balance toward osteoblastic deposition of reactive woven bone. Post-therapy biopsies can mimic low-grade osteosarcoma due to osteoid-rich areas; correct interpretation requires clinicopathologic correlation, recognition of the reactive nature of the bone, and, when needed, mutant histone H3.3 (G34W) immunohistochemistry to identify residual neoplastic stromal cells.\n\nB. Denosumab primarily targets vascular endothelial growth factor, causing decreased angiogenesis. The histology thus evolves toward cartilage formation with enchondral ossification, and the main pitfall is misdiagnosing the treated lesion as a chondrosarcoma.\n\nC. Denosumab activates RANK, increasing osteoclast activity and proliferation of multinucleated giant cells; post-therapy biopsy therefore shows increased numbers of giant cells and expanded lytic areas. The major pitfall is mistaking the lesion for an aneurysmal bone cyst.\n\nD. Denosumab commonly induces malignant transformation of the stromal cells into high-grade osteosarcoma, so the presence of woven bone after therapy is diagnostic of osteosarcoma; therefore, osteoid production in the curettage specimen should be reported as malignancy.\n\nE.

It is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Explanation\n\nThe problem asks for an explanation of the histologic changes in GCTB after denosumab therapy and the associated diagnostic pitfalls, based on fundamental principles of bone biology.\n\n1.  **Pathophysiology of GCTB:** The neoplastic cells in GCTB are the mononuclear stromal cells, which are characterized by the H$3$F$3$A mutation. These neoplastic cells secrete high levels of RANKL. The numerous osteoclast-like giant cells are not neoplastic; they are reactive cells formed by the fusion of monocytic precursors that are recruited from the circulation and induced to differentiate into mature osteoclasts by the RANKL-rich environment. These giant cells express the RANK receptor.\n\n2.  **Mechanism of Denosumab:** Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to and neutralizes RANKL.\n\n3.  **Effect of RANKL Inhibition:** By binding RANKL, denosumab prevents it from interacting with the RANK receptor on osteoclast precursors. Based on the first provided principle, this blockade inhibits the signaling pathway required for osteoclast differentiation, fusion, and activation.\n    -   This directly leads to a \"marked reduction in the numbers of giant cells,\" as observed in the post-therapy specimen.\n    -   With the osteoclast population depleted and/or inactivated, the massive bone resorption that characterizes the lytic lesion ceases.\n\n4.  **Induction of Bone Formation:** The second principle states that bone resorption and formation are coupled. In the context of GCTB treated with denosumab, the abrupt halt in resorption shifts the local bone remodeling balance dramatically towards formation. Furthermore, it has been shown that the neoplastic stromal cells in GCTB can differentiate into osteoblasts and produce bone matrix. The denosumab-induced microenvironment favors this differentiation. This results in the filling of the lytic cavity with newly synthesized bone matrix, which is initially immature and disorganized, appearing as \"abundant irregular trabeculae of woven bone.\"\n\n5.  **Neoplastic Cell Persistence:** Denosumab's mechanism is targeted at the RANKL-RANK interaction, not the neoplastic stromal cells themselves. These cells are not eradicated by the therapy. They persist within the lesion, intermixed with the newly formed bone, as a \"residual population of bland mononuclear stromal cells.\"\n\n6.  **Diagnostic Pitfalls in Post-Therapy Specimens:** The histologic appearance of the treated lesion presents a significant diagnostic challenge. A specimen containing spindle-shaped mononuclear cells (the residual stromal cells) that are surrounded by and appear to be producing abundant new bone matrix (osteoid/woven bone) can strongly mimic a primary bone-forming malignancy, specifically an osteosarcoma. Differentiating this therapy-induced, reactive ossification from a true osteosarcoma is critical. The key to correct interpretation lies in:\n    -   **Clinicopathologic Correlation:** Knowing the patient's history of GCTB and denosumab treatment is paramount.\n    -   **Histologic Clues:** The stromal cells in treated GCTB are typically bland and lack the marked cytologic atypia and atypical mitotic figures characteristic of high-grade osteosarcoma. The bone formation, while abundant, often has a more organized, albeit reactive, appearance compared to the chaotic production in osteosarcoma.\n    -   **Ancillary Studies:** Since the residual stromal cells still harbor the driver mutation, immunohistochemistry for the mutant H$3$F$3$A (G$34$W) protein can be used to confirm their identity as GCTB cells, thereby ruling out osteosarcoma.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Denosumab binds RANKL, preventing RANK activation on osteoclast precursors, which reduces osteoclastogenesis and diminishes osteoclast-like giant cells. Reduced resorption shifts the local remodeling balance toward osteoblastic deposition of reactive woven bone. Post-therapy biopsies can mimic low-grade osteosarcoma due to osteoid-rich areas; correct interpretation requires clinicopathologic correlation, recognition of the reactive nature of the bone, and, when needed, mutant histone H3.3 (G34W) immunohistochemistry to identify residual neoplastic stromal cells.**\n- This option accurately describes the mechanism of denosumab on the RANKL-RANK axis, the resulting decrease in giant cells, and the consequent shift toward reactive bone formation. It correctly identifies the primary diagnostic pitfall (mimicking osteosarcoma) and lists the essential tools for correct interpretation, including clinical history and the specific H$3$F$3$A (G$34$W) immunohistochemical stain. This statement aligns perfectly with the derived explanation.\n- **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Denosumab primarily targets vascular endothelial growth factor, causing decreased angiogenesis. The histology thus evolves toward cartilage formation with enchondral ossification, and the main pitfall is misdiagnosing the treated lesion as a chondrosarcoma.**\n- This statement is fundamentally flawed. Denosumab targets RANKL, not vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The histologic change is intramembranous ossification (woven bone formation), not cartilage formation and enchondral ossification. The diagnostic pitfall is not chondrosarcoma.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Denosumab activates RANK, increasing osteoclast activity and proliferation of multinucleated giant cells; post-therapy biopsy therefore shows increased numbers of giant cells and expanded lytic areas. The major pitfall is mistaking the lesion for an aneurysmal bone cyst.**\n- This statement describes the opposite of denosumab's mechanism and effect. Denosumab is an inhibitor of RANKL, thus *preventing* RANK activation and *decreasing* osteoclast numbers and activity. The lesion becomes ossified, not more lytic.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Denosumab commonly induces malignant transformation of the stromal cells into high-grade osteosarcoma, so the presence of woven bone after therapy is diagnostic of osteosarcoma; therefore, osteoid production in the curettage specimen should be reported as malignancy.**\n- This statement is dangerously incorrect. Malignant transformation of GCTB is a very rare event and is not considered a common consequence of denosumab therapy. The presence of woven bone is the *intended therapeutic effect* and is not diagnostic of osteosarcoma. Reporting this finding as malignancy would be a serious diagnostic error.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Denosumab eradicates the neoplastic stromal component entirely, leaving only reparative bone; immunohistochemistry is unnecessary, and a specimen dominated by woven bone confirms cure without risk of misinterpretation.**\n- This statement is incorrect on multiple points. Denosumab does not eradicate the neoplastic stromal cells; they persist and are the source of potential recurrence. Because these cells persist and the histology can mimic osteosarcoma, immunohistochemistry is a highly valuable, and sometimes necessary, tool. There is a significant risk of misinterpretation, as detailed in the analysis for option A.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4374474"}]}
