A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to calculate the Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$), which is the conditional probability of a patient having the disease given that they received a positive test result. Let $D$ be the event that a patient has the disease (osteomyelitis), and let $+$ be the event that the WBC scan result is positive. We are asked to find $PPV = P(D \\mid +)$.\n\nWe will use Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$\nP(D \\mid +) = \\frac{P(+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(+)}\n$$\n\nThe terms in this equation are identified from the problem statement:\n1.  $P(D)$ is the prior probability of having the disease, which is the given prevalence, $\\pi$.\n    $$\n    P(D) = \\pi = 0.30\n    $$\n2.  $P(+ \\mid D)$ is the probability of a positive test given the presence of the disease. This is the definition of sensitivity, $Se$.\n    $$\n    P(+ \\mid D) = Se = 0.90\n    $$\n3.  $P(+)$ is the overall probability of a positive test result. This term is not directly given and must be calculated using the law of total probability. A positive result can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios: a true positive (patient has the disease and tests positive) or a false positive (patient does not have the disease and tests positive).\n\nLet $H$ be the event that a patient is healthy (does not have the disease). The probability of being healthy is the complement of the prevalence:\n$$\nP(H) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - \\pi\n$$\nThe law of total probability for $P(+)$ is:\n$$\nP(+) = P(+ \\mid D)P(D) + P(+ \\mid H)P(H)\n$$\nWe need to find $P(+ \\mid H)$, the probability of a positive test given the patient does not have the disease. This is the false positive rate. The problem provides the specificity, $Sp$, which is the probability of a negative test given the patient does not have the disease, $P(-\\mid H)$.\n$$\nSp = P(-\\mid H) = 0.80\n$$\nSince a test result for a healthy individual is either positive or negative, the probability of a positive result is the complement of the probability of a negative result:\n$$\nP(+ \\mid H) = 1 - P(-\\mid H) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20\n$$\nNow we can substitute all the components into the formula for $P(+)$:\n$$\nP(+) = (Se)(\\pi) + (1 - Sp)(1 - \\pi)\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $P(+)$ into the Bayes' theorem formula for $PPV$, we get the complete expression for the Positive Predictive Value in terms of the given quantities:\n$$\nPPV = P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{(Se)(\\pi)}{(Se)(\\pi) + (1 - Sp)(1 - \\pi)}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided in the problem statement into this formula:\n- $\\pi = 0.30$\n- $Se = 0.90$\n- $Sp = 0.80$\n\n$$\nPPV = \\frac{(0.90)(0.30)}{(0.90)(0.30) + (1 - 0.80)(1 - 0.30)}\n$$\nFirst, we calculate the numerator:\n$$\n(0.90)(0.30) = 0.27\n$$\nNext, we calculate the terms in the denominator:\n$$\n(1 - 0.80) = 0.20\n$$\n$$\n(1 - 0.30) = 0.70\n$$\nThe second term in the denominator is:\n$$\n(0.20)(0.70) = 0.14\n$$\nThe full denominator is the sum of the true positives and false positives probabilities:\n$$\n0.27 + 0.14 = 0.41\n$$\nFinally, we compute the ratio for the $PPV$:\n$$\nPPV = \\frac{0.27}{0.41}\n$$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$\nPPV \\approx 0.658536585...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

No percentage sign is permitted.", "solution": "The problem presents two distinct but related tasks: first, to provide a pathophysiological justification for the clinical utility of the probe-to-bone (PTB) test in diagnosing osteomyelitis; and second, to derive a formula for post-test probability and compute a specific value.\n\nThe problem is valid. The clinical scenario and associated pathophysiological concepts are grounded in established medical science. The statistical component is based on fundamental principles of probability (Bayes' theorem) applied correctly to diagnostic testing. All necessary data are provided, and the problem is well-posed, leading to a unique conceptual justification and a single numerical answer.\n\nThe solution is addressed in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Pathophysiological Justification of the Probe-to-Bone Test\n\nThe probe-to-bone test is a diagnostic maneuver where a sterile, blunt metal probe is passed through a cutaneous ulcer to determine if it makes contact with the underlying bone. A positive test, defined by the firm, gritty sensation of the probe touching bone, is a strong surrogate for contiguous osteomyelitis for the following interrelated pathophysiological reasons.\n\nFirst, a positive test is direct physical evidence of a **cortical breach**. In a healthy state, bone is protected by multiple layers of soft tissue, including skin, subcutaneous fat, fascia, muscle, and the highly vascularized, innervated periosteum. A chronic ulcer, particularly a neuropathic diabetic foot ulcer, involves progressive tissue necrosis. For a probe to reach bone, this entire stratified defense must be pathologically eroded, creating a sinus tract. This erosion signifies a failure of local tissue integrity and immune defense, culminating in the exposure of the bone's outer layer, the cortex, to the external environment.\n\nSecond, the exposed bone is subjected to a massive and persistent **exposure to microbial inoculum**. The base of a chronic wound is not sterile; it is a polymicrobial milieu, rich in bacteria, fungi, and their metabolic byproducts. The necrotic tissue and poor perfusion characteristic of diabetic foot ulcers create an ideal anaerobic and nutrient-rich environment for pathogens like *Staphylococcus aureus*, streptococci, and various Gram-negative rods. When the cortex is exposed within this ulcer bed, it is directly and continuously bathed in this high-concentration inoculum. This sustained contact is the requisite event for microorganisms to invade the bone, a process known as contiguous-spread osteomyelitis.\n\nThird, the establishment of infection on the bone surface is facilitated by the **pathogenesis of biofilm on necrotic bone**. In the setting of diabetes, underlying peripheral vascular disease often compromises blood flow, rendering the exposed bone ischemic and necrotic. This devitalized bone, known as a sequestrum, provides an ideal, non-viable surface for bacterial adherence. Upon adherence, pathogens, particularly *S. aureus*, initiate the formation of a biofilm. A biofilm is a structured community of microorganisms encased in a self-produced extracellular polymeric substance. This matrix firmly attaches the bacteria to the necrotic bone and, critically, acts as a physical barrier that protects the embedded pathogens from host immune cells (e.g., phagocytes) and from achievable concentrations of systemic antibiotics. The biofilm represents the transition from simple bone contamination to established, chronic osteomyelitis, a state that is difficult to eradicate without surgical debridement.\n\nIn summary, a positive PTB test confirms a direct anatomical path from a septic ulcer base to the bone. This pathway ensures cortical exposure to a high microbial load, which, on the compromised substrate of necrotic bone common in diabetic feet, leads to the formation of a persistent biofilm. The test, therefore, does not merely detect bone proximity; it confirms the existence of the complete set of conditions required for the establishment of contiguous osteomyelitis, making it a powerful clinical surrogate for the definitive pathological diagnosis.\n\nPart 2: Derivation and Calculation of Post-Test Probability\n\nThe task is to derive the expression for the post-test probability of disease, $P_{\\text{post}}$, given a positive test, in terms of pre-test probability, $P_{\\text{pre}}$, and the positive likelihood ratio, $LR^{+}$. The derivation begins with Bayes' theorem in odds form.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has the disease (osteomyelitis) and $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result.\nThe pre-test probability is $P(D) = P_{\\text{pre}}$.\nThe post-test probability is $P(D|T^+) = P_{\\text{post}}$.\n\nThe pre-test odds of disease are defined as the ratio of the probability of having the disease to the probability of not having it:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)} = \\frac{P_{\\text{pre}}}{1 - P_{\\text{pre}}} $$\n\nSimilarly, the post-test odds are:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{P(D|T^+)}{P(D^c|T^+)} = \\frac{P_{\\text{post}}}{1 - P_{\\text{post}}} $$\n\nBayes' theorem in odds form for a positive test states that the post-test odds are the product of the pre-test odds and the positive likelihood ratio ($LR^{+}$):\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = LR^{+} \\times \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} $$\n\nSubstituting the definitions for the odds:\n$$ \\frac{P_{\\text{post}}}{1 - P_{\\text{post}}} = LR^{+} \\times \\frac{P_{\\text{pre}}}{1 - P_{\\text{pre}}} $$\n\nTo solve for $P_{\\text{post}}$, we algebraicly manipulate this equation. Let $K = LR^{+} \\times \\frac{P_{\\text{pre}}}{1 - P_{\\text{pre}}}$.\n$$ \\frac{P_{\\text{post}}}{1 - P_{\\text{post}}} = K $$\n$$ P_{\\text{post}} = K(1 - P_{\\text{post}}) $$\n$$ P_{\\text{post}} = K - K \\cdot P_{\\text{post}} $$\n$$ P_{\\text{post}} + K \\cdot P_{\\text{post}} = K $$\n$$ P_{\\text{post}}(1 + K) = K $$\n$$ P_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{K}{1 + K} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $K$ back into the equation:\n$$ P_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{LR^{+} \\frac{P_{\\text{pre}}}{1 - P_{\\text{pre}}}}{1 + LR^{+} \\frac{P_{\\text{pre}}}{1 - P_{\\text{pre}}}} $$\n\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $(1 - P_{\\text{pre}})$:\n$$ P_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{\\left(LR^{+} \\frac{P_{\\text{pre}}}{1 - P_{\\text{pre}}}\\right) \\times (1 - P_{\\text{pre}})}{\\left(1 + LR^{+} \\frac{P_{\\text{pre}}}{1 - P_{\\text{pre}}}\\right) \\times (1 - P_{\\text{pre}})} $$\n$$ P_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{LR^{+} \\cdot P_{\\text{pre}}}{1(1 - P_{\\text{pre}}) + LR^{+} \\cdot P_{\\text{pre}}} $$\nThis yields the final expression for post-test probability:\n$$ P_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{LR^{+} \\cdot P_{\\text{pre}}}{1 - P_{\\text{pre}} + LR^{+} \\cdot P_{\\text{pre}}} $$\n\nNow, we compute the post-test probability for the given values: $LR^{+} = 6.4$ and $P_{\\text{pre}} = 0.3$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$ P_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{6.4 \\times 0.3}{(1 - 0.3) + (6.4 \\times 0.3)} $$\n$$ P_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{1.92}{0.7 + 1.92} $$\n$$ P_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{1.92}{2.62} $$\n$$ P_{\\text{post}} \\approx 0.732824427... $$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ P_{\\text{post}} \\approx 0.7328 $$\nThus, a positive probe-to-bone test increases the probability of osteomyelitis from a pre-test value of $30\\%$ to a post-test value of approximately $73.3\\%$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0.7328} $$", "id": "4418544"}, {"introduction": "Once osteomyelitis is diagnosed, effective treatment requires delivering adequate antibiotic concentrations to the infected bone.

It is free from subjective claims.\n\nThe problem is self-contained, consistent, and scientifically sound. It meets all criteria for a valid problem.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe objective is to first evaluate if the current therapeutic regimen achieves the target PK/PD index at the site of infection (bone) and, if not, to calculate the necessary dose adjustment factor.\n\nLet $AUC_{24, \\text{serum, current}}$ be the area under the concentration-time curve in the serum over a $24$-hour period for the current dose, given as $500$ mg·h/L.\nLet $AUC_{24, \\text{bone, current}}$ be the corresponding $AUC$ in the bone tissue.\nThe bone-to-serum exposure ratio, $R_{\\text{bone/serum}}$, relates these two quantities.
