The solution involves three steps: defining the grading components, calculating the score for each component based on the given data, and summing these scores to determine the final grade.\n\nFirst, we define the three components of the FNCLCC grading system and their respective scoring criteria, as specified in the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Tumor Differentiation Score**: This score quantifies how closely the tumor cells resemble normal, mature mesenchymal tissue. The scores are assigned as follows:\n    *   Score $1$: Sarcomas that closely resemble normal adult mesenchymal tissue.\n    *   Score $2$: Sarcomas of specific histologic types with intermediate differentiation.\n    *   Score $3$: Undifferentiated or poorly differentiated sarcomas. The problem explicitly states that pleomorphic liposarcoma is categorized here.\n\n2.  **Mitotic Activity Score**: This score is based on the mitotic count per $10$ high-power fields (HPF) in the most mitotically active areas of the tumor. The scores are:\n    *   Score $1$: $0$–$9$ mitoses per $10$ HPF.\n    *   Score $2$: $10$–$19$ mitoses per $10$ HPF.\n    *   Score $3$: $\\geq 20$ mitoses per $10$ HPF.\n\n3.  **Tumor Necrosis Score**: This score quantifies the extent of tumor necrosis, which is a reflection of rapid, aggressive tumor growth. The scores are:\n    *   Score $0$: $0\\%$ necrosis.\n    *   Score $1$: Necrosis is present but constitutes less than $50\\%$ of the tumor area ($>0\\%$ and $<50\\%$).\n    *   Score $2$: Necrosis constitutes $50\\%$ or more of the tumor area ($\\geq 50\\%$).\n\nNext, we apply these criteria to the data provided for the case of a pleomorphic liposarcoma in a $65$-year-old individual.\n\n*   **Calculation of Tumor Differentiation Score**: The diagnosis is pleomorphic liposarcoma.

The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system integrates tumor size ($T$), nodal status ($N$), and distant metastasis ($M$) with the histologic grade ($G$) to create a comprehensive prognostic framework. This practice problem challenges you to synthesize these elements to assign a final stage to a liposarcoma, demonstrating how pathologists contribute to crucial clinical decision-making [@problem_id:4399209].", "problem": "A core principle in tumor pathology is that patient outcomes correlate with intrinsic tumor biology and the extent of disease. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging for soft tissue sarcoma formalizes this by integrating tumor size, regional lymph node involvement, distant metastasis, and histologic grade. Histologic grade, commonly assigned using the French Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer (FNCLCC) system, reflects differentiation, mitotic activity, and necrosis, and is strongly associated with metastatic potential. For liposarcoma of the extremities, size thresholds reflect tumor burden and local extension risk; nodal disease indicates regional spread; and distant metastasis indicates systemic dissemination. These factors together justify why AJCC staging is used to stratify risk and guide treatment and prognosis in liposarcoma: it is grounded in well-tested clinicopathologic correlations linking larger size, higher grade, and spread to worse outcomes.\n\nUse the following widely accepted AJCC Eighth Edition definitions for soft tissue sarcoma of the trunk and extremities:\n- Tumor size category:\n  - $T_1$: maximal dimension $\\leq 5$ cm\n  - $T_2$: maximal dimension $> 5$ cm and $\\leq 10$ cm\n  - $T_3$: maximal dimension $> 10$ cm and $\\leq 15$ cm\n  - $T_4$: maximal dimension $> 15$ cm\n- Regional lymph nodes:\n  - $N_0$: no regional lymph node metastasis\n  - $N_1$: regional lymph node metastasis present\n- Distant metastasis:\n  - $M_0$: no distant metastasis\n  - $M_1$: distant metastasis present\n- Grade:\n  - $G_1$: low grade\n  - $G_2$: intermediate grade\n  - $G_3$: high grade\n  For myxoid liposarcoma without a round-cell component, take $G_2$ as the histologic grade based on established clinicopathologic characterization of pure myxoid liposarcoma.\n\nStage groupings for trunk and extremity soft tissue sarcoma (AJCC Eighth Edition) are:\n- Stage $\\mathrm{IA}$: $T_1 N_0 M_0 G_1$\n- Stage $\\mathrm{IB}$: ($T_2 \\vee T_3 \\vee T_4$) $N_0 M_0 G_1$\n- Stage $\\mathrm{II}$: $T_1 N_0 M_0 (G_2 \\vee G_3)$\n- Stage $\\mathrm{IIIA}$: $T_2 N_0 M_0 (G_2 \\vee G_3)$\n- Stage $\\mathrm{IIIB}$: ($T_3 \\vee T_4$) $N_0 M_0 (G_2 \\vee G_3)$\n- Stage $\\mathrm{IV}$: any $N_1$ or any $M_1$ (with any $T$ and any $G$)\n\nTo produce a numeric final answer, encode the stage group using the function $\\sigma$ defined by\n$$\\sigma(\\mathrm{IA}) = 1,\\quad \\sigma(\\mathrm{IB}) = 2,\\quad \\sigma(\\mathrm{II}) = 3,\\quad \\sigma(\\mathrm{IIIA}) = 4,\\quad \\sigma(\\mathrm{IIIB}) = 5,\\quad \\sigma(\\mathrm{IV}) = 6.$$\n\nConsider a deep thigh myxoid liposarcoma with maximal dimension $12\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, negative regional lymph nodes ($N_0$), and no distant metastasis ($M_0$).

A unique solution can be derived by a direct application of the provided rules.\n\nThe task requires two parts: first, a justification for the use of American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging in liposarcoma, and second, the determination of the specific stage group and its encoded value for a given clinical case.\n\nFirst, we address the justification. The use of the AJCC staging system for liposarcoma, a type of soft tissue sarcoma, is justified because it systematically integrates the most critical prognostic factors into a standardized framework for risk stratification. This framework is not arbitrary; it is built upon extensive clinicopathologic evidence correlating specific tumor characteristics with patient outcomes. The core components of the staging system are:\n1.  **Tumor Size (T):** Larger tumors are associated with a greater tumor burden, a higher risk of local recurrence, and an increased likelihood of harboring aggressive subclones, which correlates with a poorer prognosis. The AJCC system codifies this with specific size thresholds ($T_1$ through $T_4$).\n2.  **Histologic Grade (G):** This is a measure of the tumor's intrinsic biological aggressiveness. The French Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer (FNCLCC) grading system, which evaluates tumor differentiation, mitotic activity, and necrosis, is a powerful predictor of metastatic potential. Higher-grade tumors ($G_3$) are significantly more likely to metastasize than low-grade tumors ($G_1$), leading to worse outcomes.\n3.  **Regional Lymph Node Involvement (N):** The presence of cancer cells in regional lymph nodes ($N_1$) indicates that the tumor has spread from its primary site, a key event in disease progression that significantly worsens prognosis.\n4.  **Distant Metastasis (M):** The presence of distant metastasis ($M_1$) signifies systemic disease, where the cancer has spread to remote organs. This is the most advanced stage of cancer and is associated with the poorest prognosis.\n\nBy combining these four independent, evidence-based prognostic variables ($T$, $G$, $N$, and $M$), the AJCC staging system provides a comprehensive assessment of the patient's disease status. This allows for the classification of patients into distinct prognostic groups (Stage $\\mathrm{I}$ through Stage $\\mathrm{IV}$), which is essential for guiding treatment decisions (e.g., extent of surgery, use of radiation or chemotherapy) and providing an accurate prognosis. The system's validity rests on its empirical foundation and its proven ability to predict outcomes in large patient cohorts.\n\nNext, we determine the stage for the specific case presented: a deep thigh myxoid liposarcoma with a maximal dimension of $12$ cm, negative regional lymph nodes, and no distant metastasis. We apply the provided definitions step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Determine the Tumor Size (T) Category:** The maximal dimension is stated as $12$ cm. According to the provided definitions:\n    - $T_1$: $\\leq 5$ cm\n    - $T_2$: $> 5$ cm and $\\leq 10$ cm\n    - $T_3$: $> 10$ cm and $\\leq 15$ cm\n    - $T_4$: $> 15$ cm\n    Since $10 < 12 \\leq 15$, the tumor size category is $T_3$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Regional Lymph Node (N) Category:** The problem states the patient has negative regional lymph nodes. This corresponds to the category $N_0$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Distant Metastasis (M) Category:** The problem states there is no distant metastasis. This corresponds to the category $M_0$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Histologic Grade (G) Category:** The tumor is a myxoid liposarcoma. The problem provides a specific rule for this histology: \"For myxoid liposarcoma without a round-cell component, take $G_2$ as the histologic grade\". Therefore, the grade category is $G_2$.\n\nCombining these findings, the patient's tumor is classified as $T_3 N_0 M_0 G_2$.\n\nNow, we use the stage grouping definitions to find the corresponding stage:\n- Stage $\\mathrm{IA}$: $T_1 N_0 M_0 G_1$\n- Stage $\\mathrm{IB}$: ($T_2 \\vee T_3 \\vee T_4$) $N_0 M_0 G_1$\n- Stage $\\mathrm{II}$: $T_1 N_0 M_0 (G_2 \\vee G_3)$\n- Stage $\\mathrm{IIIA}$: $T_2 N_0 M_0 (G_2 \\vee G_3)$\n- Stage $\\mathrm{IIIB}$: ($T_3 \\vee T_4$) $N_0 M_0 (G_2 \\vee G_3)$\n- Stage $\\mathrm{IV}$: any $N_1$ or any $M_1$\n\nThe patient's classification $T_3 N_0 M_0 G_2$ matches the criteria for Stage $\\mathrm{IIIB}$. The conditions are met because $T=T_3$, $N=N_0$, $M=M_0$, and $G=G_2$.\n\nFinally, we apply the encoding function $\\sigma(\\cdot)$ to this stage group. The function is defined as:\n- $\\sigma(\\mathrm{IA}) = 1$\n- $\\sigma(\\mathrm{IB}) = 2$\n- $\\sigma(\\mathrm{II}) = 3$\n- $\\sigma(\\mathrm{IIIA}) = 4$\n- $\\sigma(\\mathrm{IIIB}) = 5$\n- $\\sigma(\\mathrm{IV}) = 6$\n\nFor Stage $\\mathrm{IIIB}$, the encoded value is $\\sigma(\\mathrm{IIIB}) = 5$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{5}\n$$", "id": "4399209"}, {"introduction": "In pathology, what we see under the microscope is only a tiny fraction of the entire tumor, raising a critical question: is our sample representative?

Assume the following fundamental probabilistic model, grounded in standard sampling theory: because the dedifferentiated component occupies a fraction $p$ of the macroscopic tumor volume, the event that a randomly placed, small, non-overlapping block contains any dedifferentiated tissue can be modeled as a Bernoulli trial with success probability $p$, and different blocks can be treated as independent trials due to non-overlap.
