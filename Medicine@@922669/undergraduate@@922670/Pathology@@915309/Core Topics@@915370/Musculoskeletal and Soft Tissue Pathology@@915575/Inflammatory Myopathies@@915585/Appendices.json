This is based on conditional probabilities:\n$$ O_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{P(D | T_+)}{P(\\neg D | T_+)} $$\n\nTo relate $O_{\\text{post}}$ to $O_{\\text{pre}}$, we use Bayes' theorem. For the numerator, we have:\n$$ P(D | T_+) = \\frac{P(T_+ | D) P(D)}{P(T_+)} $$\nFor the denominator, we have:\n$$ P(\\neg D | T_+) = \\frac{P(T_+ | \\neg D) P(\\neg D)}{P(T_+)} $$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the formula for $O_{\\text{post}}$:\n$$ O_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{\\frac{P(T_+ | D) P(D)}{P(T_+)}}{\\frac{P(T_+ | \\neg D) P(\\neg D)}{P(T_+)}} $$\n\nThe term $P(T_+)$ in the denominator of both the numerator and the denominator expressions cancels out:\n$$ O_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{P(T_+ | D) P(D)}{P(T_+ | \\neg D) P(\\neg D)} $$\n\nThis expression can be rearranged by grouping terms:\n$$ O_{\\text{post}} = \\left( \\frac{P(T_+ | D)}{P(T_+ | \\neg D)} \\right) \\left( \\frac{P(D)}{P(\\neg D)} \\right) $$\n\nWe now identify the two terms in this product.\nThe first term, $\\frac{P(T_+ | D)}{P(T_+ | \\neg D)}$, is the definition of the positive likelihood ratio, $LR_{+}$. It is the ratio of the probability of a positive test in a patient with the disease (sensitivity) to the probability of a positive test in a patient without the disease ($1 - \\text{specificity}$).\n$$ LR_{+} = \\frac{P(T_+ | D)}{P(T_+ | \\neg D)} $$\n\nThe second term, $\\frac{P(D)}{P(\\neg D)}$, is the definition of the pretest odds, $O_{\\text{pre}}$.\n\nBy substitution, we arrive at the fundamental relationship between post-test odds, pretest odds, and the likelihood ratio:\n$$ O_{\\text{post}} = LR_{+} \\times O_{\\text{pre}} $$\n\nThis formula was derived from the foundational principles of probability and Bayes' theorem, as required.\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this derived formula:\n- $O_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$\n- $LR_{+} = 9.0$\n\n$$ O_{\\text{post}} = 9.0 \\times 0.25 $$\n$$ O_{\\text{post}} = 2.25 $$\n\nThe post-test odds of the patient having Cancer-Associated Dermatomyositis are $2.25$.

The described features of IBM and PM are factually correct and represent the standard understanding in the field of neurology and pathology.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear objective (distinguish IBM from PM), a constrained set of variables, and an explicit hierarchy of their use. The question asks to select the best pathway from a list of options based on these rules, which is a solvable, logical task.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, scientific language. The criteria (age, weakness pattern, pathologic markers) are objective findings in a medical evaluation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and well-posed. It is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n## SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe task is to construct a decision pathway that best distinguishes IBM from PM using a specific, ordered set of variables. The mandated priority is: 1. pathologic inclusion markers, 2. distribution of weakness, and 3. age. The optimal pathway must strictly adhere to this hierarchy.\n\n1.  **First-Level Decision (Priority 1)**: The highest priority variable is the presence of pathologic inclusion markers. The problem states that \"IBM's inclusion pathology is distinctive.\" This implies that the presence of rimmed vacuoles or p62/TDP-43 inclusions is a highly specific marker for IBM. Therefore, the first step in any valid pathway must be to check for these markers.\n    *   If inclusion markers are **present**, the diagnosis should be **IBM**. The pathway can terminate for this branch.\n\n2.  **Second-Level Decision (Priorities 2 and 3)**: If the inclusion markers are **absent**, the diagnosis is uncertain. A biopsy can have sampling error (missing the inclusions characteristic of IBM), or the patient might have PM (which lacks these inclusions). To resolve this ambiguity, the pathway must proceed to the lower-priority variables: weakness distribution (Priority 2) and age (Priority 3).\n    *   To make a diagnosis of IBM despite the absence of its most distinctive pathological feature, strong clinical evidence is required. The problem states the typical clinical picture of IBM is age $\\geq 50$ years and asymmetric weakness of finger flexors and quadriceps. A robust decision rule would require *both* of these features to be present to classify a case as IBM in the absence of inclusions. This respects the hierarchy by using both Priority 2 and 3 variables.\n    *   Therefore, if inclusion markers are absent, the next logical step is to evaluate if **both** (age $\\geq 50$ years) **and** (weakness is asymmetric affecting finger flexors/quadriceps) are true.\n        *   If **yes**, classify as **IBM**.\n        *   If **no** (i.e., the patient is younger than 50, has a different weakness pattern, or both), the clinical picture does not support IBM over PM. The default diagnosis should then be **PM**. This category includes patients with the classic PM presentation of symmetric proximal weakness.\n\n**Ideal Decision Pathway Summary:**\n1.  Are pathologic inclusion markers (rimmed vacuoles, p62/TDP-43) present?\n    *   **Yes**: Classify as **IBM**.\n    *   **No**: Proceed to step 2.\n2.  Are both of the following conditions met: (age $\\geq 50$ years) AND (weakness is asymmetric with finger flexor and quadriceps predominance)?\n    *   **Yes**: Classify as **IBM**.\n    *   **No**: Classify as **PM**.\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\nWe will now evaluate each option against the derived ideal pathway and the problem's explicit constraints.\n\n**A. First check inclusion markers: if rimmed vacuoles or p62/TDP-43 are present, classify as IBM. If not present, classify as IBM when weakness is asymmetric and predominantly involves finger flexors and quadriceps in age ≥ 50; otherwise classify as PM, especially if symmetric proximal weakness in age < 50.**\n\n*   This option correctly starts with inclusion markers (Priority 1).\n*   It correctly classifies marker-positive cases as IBM.\n*   For marker-negative cases, it requires a combination of the specific weakness pattern (Priority 2) and age (Priority 3) to classify as IBM.\n*   It correctly defaults to PM otherwise.\n*   The logic of this pathway is sound and follows the stated priorities. The final clause (\"especially if...\") is descriptive but does not alter the rigorous logic of the pathway.\n*   **Verdict**: Correct logic, but we must compare its phrasing to other options.\n\n**B. First check age: if age ≥ 50, classify as PM unless biopsy shows necrosis without inflammation; if age <50, classify as IBM if finger flexor weakness is present; otherwise classify as PM.**\n\n*   This option incorrectly starts with age, violating the stated priority that inclusion markers must be checked first.\n*   The subsequent logic is clinically and factually flawed. Age $\\geq 50$ is more typical of IBM, not PM. The criterion \"necrosis without inflammation\" is not one of the specified variables and is not characteristic of either PM or IBM.\n*   **Verdict**: Incorrect. Violates priority order and contains unsound medical logic.\n\n**C. First check weakness distribution: classify symmetric proximal weakness as PM and asymmetric finger flexor and quadriceps weakness as IBM, irrespective of age; biopsy inclusion markers are optional and not required for classification.**\n\n*   This option incorrectly starts with weakness distribution, violating the Priority 1 status of inclusion markers.\n*   The statement that \"biopsy inclusion markers are optional and not required\" directly contradicts the problem's premise that they are the highest-priority variable.\n*   **Verdict**: Incorrect. Violates priority order and explicit problem constraints.\n\n**D. First check serum Creatine Kinase (CK): if CK >10× the upper limit of normal, classify as PM; if CK is normal, classify as IBM; age and weakness distribution are used only if CK is unavailable.**\n\n*   This option introduces serum Creatine Kinase (CK), which is not one of the three variables specified for pathway construction.\n*   It incorrectly elevates this unlisted variable to the highest priority, violating the entire given framework.\n*   **Verdict**: Incorrect. Violates problem constraints by using an unspecified variable and ignoring the given priority structure.\n\n**E. First check inclusion markers: if rimmed vacuoles or p62/TDP-43 inclusions are present, classify as IBM. If inclusions are absent, classify as IBM only when both age ≥ 50 and weakness is asymmetric with finger flexor and quadriceps predominance; otherwise classify as PM.**\n\n*   This option correctly starts with inclusion markers (Priority 1) and classifies positive cases as IBM.\n*   For marker-negative cases, it proceeds to the next step. It explicitly requires that \"both age ≥ 50 and weakness is asymmetric...\" must be met to classify a case as IBM. The use of \"both\" and \"only when\" provides unambiguous logical precision.\n*   It correctly classifies all other cases as PM.\n*   This pathway's logic perfectly matches the ideal pathway derived from first principles. It correctly implements the priority hierarchy and uses a strict, logical combination of the lower-priority variables when the highest-priority variable is uninformative.\n*   Comparing to option A, option E is stated with superior logical clarity and rigor. The phrasing \"only when both\" is more precise for an algorithm than \"when ... in age ...\". Thus, it is the *best* implementation.\n*   **Verdict**: Correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "4392512"}]}
