A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem describes a classic Hertzian contact scenario between a sphere and a flat surface. The peak contact stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{peak}}$, occurs at the center of the circular contact area. The derivation begins with the foundational equations of Hertzian contact theory.\n\nThe pressure distribution across the contact area is semi-ellipsoidal (or a paraboloid of revolution), and the relationship between the total load $F$ and the peak pressure $p_0$ (which is $\\sigma_{\\text{peak}}$) is given by:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{peak}} = p_0 = \\frac{3F}{2\\pi a^2} $$\nwhere $a$ is the radius of the circular contact area.\n\nThe radius of contact $a$ depends on the load $F$, the material properties, and the geometry of the contacting bodies. The formula for $a$ is:\n$$ a = \\left( \\frac{3FR^*}{4E^*} \\right)^{1/3} $$\nHere, $R^*$ is the effective radius of curvature and $E^*$ is the effective Young's modulus.\n\nFirst, we define these effective quantities. The effective radius $R^*$ is given by:\n$$ \\frac{1}{R^*} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} $$\nIn this problem, the femoral condyle is modeled as a sphere of radius $R_1 = R$. The tibial cartilage surface is relatively flat, so it is modeled as a plane, which has an infinite radius of curvature, $R_2 = \\infty$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{R^*} = \\frac{1}{R} + \\frac{1}{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{R} \\implies R^* = R $$\nThe problem text implicitly confirms this by providing a single \"effective radius $R$\".\n\nNext, the effective modulus $E^*$ is given by:\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{E_1} + \\frac{1-\\nu_2^2}{E_2} $$\nThe problem states that identical cartilage is on both surfaces, so $E_1 = E_2 = E$ and $\\nu_1 = \\nu_2 = \\nu$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1-\\nu^2}{E} + \\frac{1-\\nu^2}{E} = \\frac{2(1-\\nu^2)}{E} $$\n$$ E^* = \\frac{E}{2(1-\\nu^2)} $$\n\nNow, we can derive the expression for $\\sigma_{\\text{peak}}$ in terms of the given parameters. We substitute the expression for $a$ into the equation for $\\sigma_{\\text{peak}}$. Rearranging the equation for $a$:\n$$ a^3 = \\frac{3FR^*}{4E^*} $$\nFrom the equation for $\\sigma_{\\text{peak}}$, we can write $a^2 = \\frac{3F}{2\\pi \\sigma_{\\text{peak}}}$.\nSubstituting this into the cubed expression for $a$:\n$$ a^3 = (a^2)^{3/2} = \\left( \\frac{3F}{2\\pi \\sigma_{\\text{peak}}} \\right)^{3/2} $$\nEquating the two expressions for $a^3$:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{3F}{2\\pi \\sigma_{\\text{peak}}} \\right)^{3/2} = \\frac{3FR^*}{4E^*} $$\nTo solve for $\\sigma_{\\text{peak}}$, we square both sides:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{3F}{2\\pi \\sigma_{\\text{peak}}} \\right)^{3} = \\left( \\frac{3FR^*}{4E^*} \\right)^{2} $$\n$$ \\frac{27F^3}{8\\pi^3 \\sigma_{\\text{peak}}^3} = \\frac{9F^2 (R^*)^2}{16(E^*)^2} $$\nIsolating $\\sigma_{\\text{peak}}^3$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{peak}}^3 = \\frac{27F^3}{8\\pi^3} \\frac{16(E^*)^2}{9F^2 (R^*)^2} = \\frac{6 F (E^*)^2}{\\pi^3 (R^*)^2} $$\nTaking the cube root gives the general expression for peak stress:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{peak}} = \\left( \\frac{6 F (E^*)^2}{\\pi^3 (R^*)^2} \\right)^{1/3} $$\nThis is the derived expression. We now substitute our specific forms for $E^*$ and $R^*$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{peak}} = \\left( \\frac{6 F \\left( \\frac{E}{2(1-\\nu^2)} \\right)^2}{\\pi^3 R^2} \\right)^{1/3} = \\left( \\frac{6 F E^2}{4\\pi^3 R^2 (1-\\nu^2)^2} \\right)^{1/3} = \\left( \\frac{3 F E^2}{2\\pi^3 R^2 (1-\\nu^2)^2} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n### Numerical Computation\nWe use the provided values in SI units: $F = 2.50 \\times 10^{3}$ N, $R = 2.50 \\times 10^{-2}$ m, $E = 1.20 \\times 10^{7}$ Pa, and $\\nu = 0.45$.\n\nFirst, we compute the intermediate terms:\n$$ 1-\\nu^2 = 1 - (0.45)^2 = 1 - 0.2025 = 0.7975 $$\nThe numerator term inside the parenthesis:\n$$ 3 F E^2 = 3 \\times (2.50 \\times 10^{3}) \\times (1.20 \\times 10^{7})^2 = 3 \\times (2.50 \\times 10^{3}) \\times (1.44 \\times 10^{14}) = 1.08 \\times 10^{18} \\, \\text{N} \\cdot \\text{Pa}^2 $$\nThe denominator term inside the parenthesis:\n$$ 2\\pi^3 R^2 (1-\\nu^2)^2 = 2\\pi^3 \\times (2.50 \\times 10^{-2})^2 \\times (0.7975)^2 $$\n$$ = 2\\pi^3 \\times (6.25 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (0.63600625) \\approx (62.0125) \\times (6.25 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (0.63600625) \\approx 0.024653 \\, \\text{m}^2 $$\nNow we compute the ratio:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{peak}}^3 = \\frac{1.08 \\times 10^{18}}{0.024653} \\approx 4.3807 \\times 10^{19} \\, \\text{Pa}^3 $$\nTaking the cube root:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{peak}} = (4.3807 \\times 10^{19})^{1/3} \\, \\text{Pa} = (43.807 \\times 10^{18})^{1/3} \\, \\text{Pa} \\approx 3.525 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{Pa} $$\nThe question asks for the result in megapascals (MPa), where $1 \\, \\text{MPa} = 10^6 \\, \\text{Pa}$.\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{peak}} \\approx 3.525 \\, \\text{MPa} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $3.53 \\, \\text{MPa}$.\n\n### Mechanobiological Explanation\n\nAn increase in peak contact stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{peak}}$, beyond the physiological range is a primary driver for the initiation and progression of osteoarthritis (OA). Healthy articular cartilage is maintained by a homeostatic balance between matrix synthesis and degradation, a process regulated by chondrocytes in response to mechanical signals. Excessive stress disrupts this balance, accelerating OA through a cascade of events at both the tissue and cellular levels.\n\nAt the **tissue level**, mechanical overstress leads to direct damage to the extracellular matrix (ECM). The collagen fibril network, particularly the superficial tangential zone which resists shear and tensile forces, can suffer fatigue failure and rupture. This compromises the structural integrity of the tissue, leading to an increase in its permeability. A more permeable matrix is less efficient at generating the interstitial fluid pressurization that is critical for bearing compressive loads. Consequently, a larger proportion of the load is transferred directly to the solid ECM and the embedded chondrocytes, amplifying stress concentrations and exacerbating matrix damage. This feedback loop of damage and compromised function manifests as surface fibrillation, cracking (fissuring), and eventual erosion of the cartilage layer.\n\nAt the **cellular level**, chondrocytes sense the excessive mechanical stress via mechanotransduction pathways. This pathological signal shifts the cells from an anabolic/homeostatic state to a catabolic one. Overstressed chondrocytes upregulate the expression and secretion of matrix-degrading enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs, especially MMP-13 which degrades type II collagen) and aggrecanases (e.g., ADAMTS-4, ADAMTS-5, which degrade aggrecan). Concurrently, these cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). These mediators further stimulate the production of catabolic enzymes while simultaneously suppressing the synthesis of new matrix components (type II collagen and aggrecan) by the chondrocytes. This creates a self-perpetuating cycle of matrix degradation. Ultimately, severe and sustained overstress can induce chondrocyte apoptosis (programmed cell death), resulting in a hypocellular, mechanically incompetent tissue with no intrinsic capacity for repair, leading to the irreversible joint destruction characteristic of end-stage OA.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{3.53} $$", "id": "4416856"}]}
