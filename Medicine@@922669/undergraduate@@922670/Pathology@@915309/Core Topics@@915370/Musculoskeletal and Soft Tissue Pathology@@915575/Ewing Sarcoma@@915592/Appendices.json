It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, and well-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem instructs us to compute the necrosis proportion based on the provided principles. Principle (ii) states that the ratio of necrosis-only blocks to the total number of blocks serves as the estimator for the necrosis proportion.\n\nLet $P_{necrosis}$ be the estimated necrosis proportion.\nLet $N_{total}$ be the total number of tissue blocks, and let $N_{necrotic\\_only}$ be the number of blocks containing only necrosis.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, we are given:\n$$N_{total} = 120$$\n$$N_{necrotic\\_only} = 18$$\n\nThe estimator for the necrosis proportion is given by the ratio:\n$$P_{necrosis} = \\frac{N_{necrotic\\_only}}{N_{total}}$$\nSubstituting the given values into the equation:\n$$P_{necrosis} = \\frac{18}{120}$$\n\nTo express this fraction in simplest terms, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator, $18$, and the denominator, $120$.\nThe prime factorization of $18$ is $2 \\times 3^2$.\nThe prime factorization of $120$ is $12 \\times 10 = (2^2 \\times 3) \\times (2 \\times 5) = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5$.\nThe GCD is the product of the lowest powers of common prime factors, which is $2^1 \\times 3^1 = 6$.\n\nDividing the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, $6$:\n$$P_{necrosis} = \\frac{18 \\div 6}{120 \\div 6} = \\frac{3}{20}$$\nThis is the first part of the final answer.\n\nNext, we must determine whether this proportion meets the \"good histologic response\" threshold, which is defined as a necrosis proportion greater than $0.90$. We must evaluate the inequality:\n$$P_{necrosis} > 0.90$$\nSubstituting our calculated value:\n$$\\frac{3}{20} > 0.90$$\nTo compare these, we can convert the fraction to a decimal.\n$$\\frac{3}{20} = \\frac{3 \\times 5}{20 \\times 5} = \\frac{15}{100} = 0.15$$\nNow, the inequality becomes:\n$$0.15 > 0.90$$\nThis statement is false. Therefore, the histologic response does not meet the specified threshold for a good response.\n\nThe problem requires a binary indicator, which is $1$ if the threshold is met and $0$ otherwise. Since the threshold is not met, the binary indicator is $0$.\n\nThe final answer is a two-entry row matrix. The first entry is the necrosis proportion as a fraction in simplest terms, $\\frac{3}{20}$. The second entry is the binary indicator, $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{20} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4367700"}]}
