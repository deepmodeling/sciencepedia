Starting from fundamental principles of diagnostic surgical pathology, including the concept that epithelial tumors are classified by their differentiation patterns, and that immunohistochemistry relies on specific antigen-antibody binding to detect protein expression profiles in situ, choose the single best systematic approach that confirms basal cell carcinoma while excluding important mimics such as trichoepithelioma, basaloid squamous cell carcinoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma. Your choice should reflect a reasoned sequence that integrates architecture and cytology, special stains, immunohistochemical profiling, and clinicopathologic correlation grounded in well-tested facts, rather than reliance on any one isolated feature.\n\nA. Begin with special staining to demonstrate stromal mucin and retraction clefts; then check for papillary mesenchymal bodies and horn cysts to exclude trichoepithelioma; perform immunohistochemistry with Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) antibody BerEP4 and B-cell lymphoma 2 protein (BCL2), interpreting BCL2 nuclear positivity and Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA) positivity as supportive of basal cell carcinoma; finally, use Cytokeratin 20 (CK20) negativity to exclude Merkel cell carcinoma and proceed without clinical correlation.\n\nB.

Perform a stepwise evaluation: first, confirm architectural and cytologic features compatible with basal cell carcinoma by identifying peripheral palisading, basaloid cytology, and retraction artifact around nests, and demonstrate stromal glycosaminoglycan with a mucin stain such as Alcian blue; second, actively exclude basaloid squamous cell carcinoma by searching for squamous differentiation (intercellular bridges and keratinization) and using an immunopanel in which basal cell carcinoma typically shows BerEP4 positivity and EMA negativity, while basaloid squamous cell carcinoma is often BerEP4 negative and EMA positive; third, exclude trichoepithelioma by looking for papillary mesenchymal bodies and horn cysts and by noting that BCL2 expression in trichoepithelioma is typically limited to the tumor periphery and that CD10 highlights stroma rather than tumor cells, whereas basal cell carcinoma shows diffuse BCL2 and frequent tumor-cell CD10; fourth, exclude Merkel cell carcinoma by confirming CK20 negativity in tumor cells, since Merkel cell carcinoma characteristically shows CK20 perinuclear dot-like positivity; finally, integrate clinical features such as a pearly papule with telangiectasias on sun-exposed skin and assess growth pattern to subclassify nodular versus infiltrative or morpheaform basal cell carcinoma and to inform margin status.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It presents a realistic clinical scenario in dermatopathology, grounded in established scientific principles of histologic and immunohistochemical diagnosis. The givens are self-contained and consistent, and the question is well-posed, asking for the best systematic approach to a common and important diagnostic challenge. The entities described—basal cell carcinoma (BCC), trichoepithelioma (TE), basaloid squamous cell carcinoma (BSCC), and Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)—and their associated histopathological and immunophenotypic features are well-documented in the medical literature. The problem is objective and requires a rigorous application of diagnostic principles.\n\nThe fundamental principles for diagnosing an epithelial tumor, as stated in the problem, involve a multi-step, integrated approach. This begins with evaluation of the architecture and cytology on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides, followed by ancillary studies like special stains and immunohistochemistry (IHC) when necessary to resolve a differential diagnosis, and culminates in clinicopathologic correlation.\n\nThe provided description of a shave biopsy from a sun-exposed facial lesion showing basaloid nests, peripheral palisading, a mucin-rich stroma, and peritumoral clefting is classic for basal cell carcinoma (BCC). However, these features can have overlap with other basaloid neoplasms, necessitating a systematic approach to confirm the diagnosis and exclude important mimics.\n\nA correct systematic approach would proceed as follows:\n1.  **Morphologic Assessment (H&E):** The initial step is a thorough examination of the H&E slide. The features given (basaloid cytology, peripheral palisading of nuclei in the tumor nests, and stromal retraction artifact) are highly suggestive of BCC. The presence of a mucinous or myxoid stroma further supports this. At this stage, one must actively search for features that would suggest an alternative diagnosis.\n    - For trichoepithelioma (TE): Look for well-circumscribed, symmetric nests, horn cysts (keratin-filled cysts), and papillary mesenchymal bodies (abortive hair papillae).\n    - For basaloid squamous cell carcinoma (BSCC): Look for connection to an overlying squamous cell carcinoma in situ, evidence of squamous differentiation (e.g., intercellular bridges, keratinization, eosinophilic cytoplasm), and a higher degree of nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity, and necrosis than is typical for BCC.\n    - For Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC): Look for sheets or trabeculae of cells with fine \"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin, scant cytoplasm, indistinct cell borders, and a high mitotic and apoptotic rate.\n\n2.  **Special Stains:** To confirm the presence of stromal mucin (glycosaminoglycans), a special stain like Alcian blue at $pH$ $2.5$ can be used. A positive result highlights the mucin in blue and supports the diagnosis of BCC, although it is not specific.\n\n3.  **Immunohistochemistry (IHC):** If the diagnosis is not definitive on morphology, or if features are concerning for a mimic, a targeted IHC panel is essential. The choice of antibodies is critical.\n    - **BCC vs. TE:** BerEP4 (EpCAM) is strongly and diffusely positive in BCC but typically negative or only focally positive in TE. BCL2 shows diffuse cytoplasmic positivity in BCC, whereas in TE it is characteristically restricted to the outermost basaloid cell layer. CD10 often stains the stroma in TE, while in BCC it may stain the tumor cells.\n    - **BCC vs. BSCC:** This is a crucial distinction. BCC is characteristically BerEP4 positive and Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA) negative. Conversely, BSCC, being a variant of SCC, is typically BerEP4 negative and EMA positive.\n    - **BCC vs. MCC:** The distinction is usually clear-cut with IHC. MCC is defined by its expression of Cytokeratin 20 (CK20) in a characteristic perinuclear dot-like pattern, along with neuroendocrine markers like synaptophysin and chromogranin. BCC is negative for CK20 and neuroendocrine markers.\n\n4.  **Clinicopathologic Correlation and Final Reporting:** The final diagnosis must integrate all the above findings with the clinical information (patient age, lesion location, clinical appearance, history of sun exposure). The pathologist's report should also include prognostically relevant information, such as the subtype of BCC (e.g., nodular, infiltrative, morpheaform) and the status of the biopsy margins.\n\nBased on this correct, principle-based approach, we evaluate the given options.\n\n**A. Begin with special staining...; interpret BCL2 nuclear positivity and EMA positivity as supportive of basal cell carcinoma...; proceed without clinical correlation.**\nThis option contains multiple, critical errors. First, the diagnostic process begins with H&E morphology, not special stains. Second, BCL2 is an anti-apoptotic protein located on the mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum membranes, exhibiting cytoplasmic, not nuclear, staining. Third, EMA positivity is a feature of BSCC, not BCC; BCC is characteristically EMA negative. Fourth, proceeding without clinical correlation violates a fundamental principle of pathology.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. Rely primarily on a high proliferation index by Ki-67; confirm basal cell carcinoma by S100 positivity...; add EMA positivity as supportive...**\nThis option is factually incorrect on multiple counts. The proliferation index (Ki-67) is nonspecific and cannot be the primary basis for diagnosis, as many aggressive tumors have high proliferation rates. S100 is a marker for neural crest-derived cells (e.g., melanocytes, nerve sheath cells) and is negative in BCC. S100 positivity would suggest a differential including melanoma or a neurotropic tumor. As with option A, stating that EMA positivity supports BCC is incorrect.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Diagnose basal cell carcinoma if p63 is positive and pan-cytokeratin is negative...; exclude basaloid squamous cell carcinoma solely by the absence of keratin pearls; treat stromal mucin and clefting as nonspecific and do not use any special stains or clinical correlation.**\nThis option is flawed. BCC is an epithelial tumor and is therefore positive for pan-cytokeratin; a negative result would argue against the diagnosis. p63 is a marker of basal/myoepithelial/squamous lineage and is positive in both BCC and BSCC, so it is not a useful discriminator between them. Relying \"solely\" on a single morphological feature like keratin pearls is poor practice and against the instructions of the problem. Ignoring key morphologic clues and clinical data is improper.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Use cluster of differentiation 10 (CD10) immunohistochemistry and treat stromal CD10 positivity as diagnostic of basal cell carcinoma; interpret BerEP4 negativity as supportive of...; consider CK20 perinuclear dot-like positivity compatible with...**\nThis option has every key interpretation reversed. Stromal CD10 positivity is a feature more suggestive of trichoepithelioma, not BCC. Strong and diffuse BerEP4 *positivity* is the classic finding in BCC; negativity would argue against it. CK20 perinuclear dot-like positivity is the pathognomonic immunophenotype of Merkel cell carcinoma, not BCC. Deciding only on immunoprofile without morphology is a cardinal sin in pathology.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Perform a stepwise evaluation: first, confirm architectural and cytologic features...; second, actively exclude basaloid squamous cell carcinoma...; third, exclude trichoepithelioma...; fourth, exclude Merkel cell carcinoma...; finally, integrate clinical features...**\nThis option accurately describes the correct, logical, and systematic diagnostic workflow. It begins with morphology (H&E), proceeds to a targeted and correctly interpreted IHC panel to exclude specific mimics (BerEP4/EMA for BSCC; BCL2/CD10 for TE; CK20 for MCC), and concludes with the essential step of clinicopathologic correlation and providing prognostically relevant information. Every step and interpretation mentioned is factually correct and aligns with the standard of care in diagnostic pathology.\n**Verdict:** Correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "4331817"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis of a low-risk basal cell carcinoma is confirmed, the focus shifts to definitive surgical treatment. A successful excision requires removing the tumor with an adequate margin of surrounding healthy tissue to prevent recurrence.

You will calculate the precise dimensions needed to achieve oncologic clearance while planning for an aesthetically favorable closure.", "problem": "A surgical team plans a fusiform elliptical excision for a clinically low-risk nodular Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) on the dorsal forearm.

Then compute $L$ and $W$ for this case and report the numerical values. Round each value to three significant figures. Express both $L$ and $W$ in millimeters. Provide your final numeric result as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} L & W \\end{pmatrix}$.", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of surgical oncology and geometry, is well-posed, and is presented in an objective, unambiguous manner. We may therefore proceed with a formal derivation and solution.\n\nLet the maximal diameter of the nodular Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) be denoted by $d$, and the required uniform clinical margin be denoted by $m$. The planned excision is a fusiform ellipse with major axis length $L$ and minor axis width $W$.\n\nThe primary objective of the excision is to remove the tumor along with a specified margin of healthy tissue to ensure complete oncologic clearance. The problem states a uniform clinical margin of $m$ is required around the visible tumor. We can model the lesion as a circular area with diameter $d$. The area to be excised must therefore encompass a larger circular region defined by the lesion plus the surrounding margin.\n\nThe diameter of this conceptual \"clearance circle\" is the sum of the lesion's diameter and the margins on either side. The minor axis of the elliptical excision, $W$, must, at a minimum, span this entire diameter to ensure the margins are achieved in the direction perpendicular to the major axis. This is the most efficient design, as any larger width would be superfluous to the stated margin requirement. Therefore, the minor axis width $W$ is determined directly from the lesion diameter and the margin, based on first principles of geometric clearance.\n\nThe total width is the sum of the lesion diameter and the margin on both sides along this axis.\n$$W = d + 2m$$\n\nThis expression provides the minor axis width of the elliptical excision in terms of the given parameters.\n\nNext, we consider the major axis length, $L$. The design of a fusiform ellipse for surgical closure is governed by aesthetic and functional considerations, primarily the avoidance of \"dog ears\" or standing cone deformities at the apices of the wound. A standard surgical heuristic to achieve a flat closure is to maintain a specific ratio between the length and width of the ellipse. The problem states this length-to-width ratio is $3:1$.\n$$\\frac{L}{W} = 3$$\nFrom this geometric constraint, we can express the major axis length $L$ in terms of the minor axis width $W$:\n$$L = 3W$$\n\nBy substituting our previously derived expression for $W$, we can express $L$ directly in terms of the initial parameters $d$ and $m$:\n$$L = 3(d + 2m)$$\n\nWe have now derived the expressions for both $W$ and $L$ from first principles as requested.\n\nThe next step is to compute the numerical values for this specific case.\nThe given values are:\nLesion maximal diameter, $d = 1.2 \\text{ cm}$.\nClinical margin, $m = 4 \\text{ mm}$.\n\nTo maintain consistent units, we convert the diameter to millimeters.

It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Problem Analysis and Derivation\n\nThe core task is to determine the optimal management for a specific case of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and to quantify the risk of residual disease. This requires a systematic risk-stratification of the tumor, followed by selecting a treatment modality and an accompanying statistical prognosis based on evidence.\n\n1.  **Risk Stratification:** According to major guidelines, such as those from the NCCN, BCCs are stratified into low-risk and high-risk categories to guide treatment. A tumor is classified as high-risk if it meets one or more high-risk criteria.\n    -   **Location:** The tumor is on the nasal ala. The nose is part of the \"H-zone\" of the face (central face, eyelids, eyebrows, nose, lips, chin, ear, periauricular area, temple), a criterion for high risk due to higher recurrence rates and the importance of tissue conservation.\n    -   **Histologic Subtype:** The diagnosis is an **infiltrative** subtype. Infiltrative, morpheaform/sclerosing, and micronodular patterns are defined as aggressive growth patterns and are high-risk criteria. They are characterized by fine, angulated strands of tumor cells that extend irregularly into the dermis, making the clinical borders ill-defined and subclinical extension extensive.\n    -   **Margin Status:** The tumor is present at the surgical margin after a wide local excision. This is, by definition, an incompletely excised tumor, a major risk factor for recurrence.\n\n    This tumor possesses at least three high-risk features (location, histology, positive margin). It is unequivocally a **high-risk BCC**.\n\n2.  **Selection of Re-excision Strategy:** The goal for a high-risk, incompletely excised BCC is to achieve definitive tumor clearance while maximally preserving healthy tissue, which is particularly critical in the cosmetically and functionally sensitive H-zone.\n    -   **Observation:** This is inappropriate for a confirmed incompletely excised high-risk cancer. It ensures persistent and progressive local invasion.\n    -   **Electrodessication and Curettage (EDC):** This is a non-histologically controlled destructive method. It is contraindicated for high-risk subtypes like infiltrative BCC and for any tumor with positive margins, as it offers no way to confirm clearance of the microscopically infiltrative tumor strands.\n    -   **Standard Wide Local Excision (WLE):** Repeating a WLE with fixed margins (e.g., $4$–$5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) is an option but is suboptimal. This method has a significant \"miss rate\" for infiltrative tumors because it relies on a statistical guess of the tumor's extent. Given that the first attempt with a $4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ margin failed, and the tumor's growth pattern is inherently unpredictable, a second blind excision carries a substantial risk of yet again leaving a positive margin.\n    -   **Mohs Micrographic Surgery (MMS):** This technique involves the staged excision of tissue with comprehensive ($100\\%$) microscopic examination of the peripheral and deep margins of each stage. It allows for the precise removal of tumor \"roots\" while sparing uninvolved tissue. For high-risk BCCs—especially those with aggressive histology, location in the H-zone, and positive margins on a prior excision—MMS is the treatment of choice, offering the highest cure rates (up to $99\\%$ for primary BCCs) and maximal tissue conservation. Therefore, MMS is the most appropriate re-excision strategy.\n\n3.  **Estimation of Residual Tumor Probability:** The question asks for the likelihood of finding residual tumor on re-excision for an infiltrative BCC with a positive margin. This is not the same as the ultimate recurrence rate after no further treatment; it is the rate of positive findings during the immediate re-excision procedure.\n    -   The presence of a positive margin in an infiltrative BCC is a strong predictor of significant residual tumor. The infiltrative strands extend far beyond what is clinically visible.\n    -   Numerous studies in dermatologic surgery have quantified this risk. For aggressive histologic subtypes (infiltrative, morpheaform, etc.) with positive margins, the rate of finding residual tumor on subsequent Mohs excision is consistently high. A comprehensive literature review and several large studies report this rate to be in the range of $60\\%$ to over $80\\%$. This is significantly higher than the rate for low-risk nodular BCCs, which is closer to $30\\%$ to $50\\%$.\n    -   Therefore, an evidence-grounded estimate for this specific scenario is approximately $60\\%$–$80\\%$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Repeat standard wide local excision with an additional fixed $4$–$5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ clinical margin; anticipate residual tumor in approximately $20$–$30\\%$ of cases.**\n\n-   **Strategy:** This strategy is suboptimal. Mohs surgery is the preferred standard of care for this high-risk tumor.\n-   **Probability:** The estimated probability of residual tumor ($20\\%$–$30\\%$) is a severe underestimate for an infiltrative BCC with a positive margin.
