Then select the option that lists the correct mapping for Sample 1, Sample 2, and Sample 3 in order.\n\nSample 1: The epidermis is thickened with elongation and broadening of rete ridges. There is orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis with focal parakeratosis and a prominently thickened granular layer.

Nuclei are slightly enlarged basally but lack significant pleomorphism or hyperchromasia. Mitoses are confined to the basal layer and are typical in appearance. The superficial dermis shows fibrosis consistent with chronic rubbing.\n\nSample 2: A biopsy from sun-exposed scalp shows focal crowding and atypia of basal keratinocytes with nuclear enlargement and hyperchromasia limited predominantly to the lower epidermis. Above this zone, keratinocytes maintain maturation and polarity. The granular layer is focally diminished. The stratum corneum shows parakeratosis. The underlying superficial dermis exhibits solar elastosis.

The classification must be based on core definitions of epidermal maturation, dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ.\n- **Specimen Descriptions**:\n    - **Sample 1**: Thickened epidermis with elongated rete ridges; orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis with focal parakeratosis; thickened granular layer; orderly keratinocyte stratification, polarity, and maturation; slightly enlarged basal nuclei without significant pleomorphism or hyperchromasia; mitoses confined to the basal layer and typical; superficial dermal fibrosis.\n    - **Sample 2**: From sun-exposed scalp; focal crowding and atypia of basal keratinocytes (nuclear enlargement, hyperchromasia) limited to the lower epidermis; maintained maturation and polarity in upper epidermis; focally diminished granular layer; parakeratosis; solar elastosis in the dermis; no dermal invasion.\n    - **Sample 3**: Disordered architecture and loss of maturation throughout the entire epidermal thickness; atypical keratinocytes from basal to superficial layers with nuclear pleomorphism and increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios; numerous mitotic figures, including abnormal forms, above the basal layer; dyskeratosis; intact basement membrane with no dermal invasion.\n- **Question**: Identify the option that correctly maps the classification to Sample 1, Sample 2, and Sample 3, respectively.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is found to be **valid**.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on the established principles and diagnostic criteria of histopathology, a core discipline within medicine and biology.

It is a standard-form diagnostic problem in pathology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\n\nThe classification of these epithelial lesions hinges on the degree and extent of cytologic atypia and the disruption of normal epidermal maturation. We define the key histopathological entities based on first principles.\n\n1.  **Normal Epidermal Maturation**: The epidermis is a stratified squamous epithelium that undergoes a highly organized process of maturation. Proliferation is confined to the basal layer. As keratinocytes move upwards, they differentiate sequentially into the stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, and finally the anucleated stratum corneum. This orderly progression, with a predictable increase in cell size and flattening towards the surface, is known as \"polarity\" and \"maturation\".\n\n2.  **Reactive Hyperplasia**: This is a benign, non-neoplastic proliferation of the epidermis in response to an external stimulus (e.g., chronic friction or inflammation). It is characterized by a thickening of all epidermal layers (acanthosis, hypergranulosis, hyperkeratosis). Crucially, the normal architecture and orderly sequence of maturation are preserved. While nuclei may be slightly enlarged due to increased cellular activity, significant cytologic atypia (pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio) is absent. Mitotic activity remains confined to the basal layer.\n\n3.  **Actinic Keratosis (AK)**: This is a pre-malignant lesion caused by chronic sun exposure. It is a form of dysplasia, defined by cytologic atypia of keratinocytes. The key feature of AK is that this atypia is **partial-thickness**, confined to the lower portion of the epidermis (typically the basal layer). The upper layers of the epidermis still show signs of maturation, albeit often imperfectly. Associated findings include parakeratosis (retention of nuclei in the stratum corneum, indicating accelerated transit time) and solar elastosis in the underlying dermis.\n\n4.  **Squamous Cell Carcinoma in situ (SCCis)**: This is an intraepidermal carcinoma, meaning it is a malignant neoplasm confined to the epidermis without invasion through the basement membrane. It is defined by **full-thickness** dysplasia. Atypical keratinocytes with marked pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, and increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios occupy the entire thickness of the epidermis, from the basal layer to the surface. There is a complete loss of orderly maturation and polarity. Mitotic figures, which may be abnormal in form, are frequently found in the upper layers of the epidermis (suprabasal mitoses), a key indicator of malignancy.\n\n### Analysis of Specimens\n\n**Sample 1 Analysis**:\nThe description highlights epidermal thickening (\"thickened with elongation and broadening of rete ridges\"), hyperkeratosis, and hypergranulosis. However, the critical findings are \"orderly stratification,\" \"preserved polarity and maturation,\" \"mitoses are confined to the basal layer,\" and the lack of \"significant pleomorphism or hyperchromasia.\" These features are the hallmark of a benign reactive process where the epidermis has proliferated but maintains its fundamental architecture and differentiation program. These findings are inconsistent with the dysplasia seen in AK or the full-thickness atypia of SCCis. The dermal fibrosis, noted as \"consistent with chronic rubbing,\" provides a cause for the reactive changes.\nTherefore, Sample 1 is **Reactive hyperplasia**.\n\n**Sample 2 Analysis**:\nThe key finding is \"atypia of basal keratinocytes...limited predominantly to the lower epidermis.\" Above this atypical zone, \"keratinocytes maintain maturation and polarity.\" This description perfectly matches the definition of partial-thickness dysplasia, which is the defining characteristic of actinic keratosis. The location on \"sun-exposed scalp,\" the presence of \"solar elastosis\" in the dermis, and \"parakeratosis\" are all classic supporting features of AK. The process is clearly not reactive due to the presence of atypia, and it is not SCCis because the atypia does not involve the full thickness of the epidermis.\nTherefore, Sample 2 is **Actinic keratosis**.\n\n**Sample 3 Analysis**:\nThe description states that \"atypical keratinocytes...are present from the basal layer to the superficial layers,\" leading to a \"loss of normal maturation\" throughout the \"entire thickness of the epidermis.\" Furthermore, there are \"numerous mitotic figures, including abnormal forms...seen above the basal layer.\" These findings—full-thickness atypia and suprabasal/abnormal mitoses—are the definitive criteria for squamous cell carcinoma in situ. The noted intact basement membrane confirms the \"in situ\" nature of the carcinoma, as there is no invasion.\nTherefore, Sample 3 is **Squamous cell carcinoma in situ**.\n\n### Summary of Classifications\n- Sample 1: Reactive hyperplasia\n- Sample 2: Actinic keratosis\n- Sample 3: Squamous cell carcinoma in situ\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

Tumor thickness is one of the most powerful predictors of outcome, but its measurement must be precise and standardized.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of oncologic pathology, specifically concerning the histologic assessment of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and data for a unique and stable solution. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. The problem requires a direct application of provided definitions to a set of findings, a standard task in pathology reporting and staging.\n\nThe task is to determine two values based on the provided histopathology report and definitions: the tumor thickness and an indicator for invasion beyond the subcutis.\n\nFirst, we determine the tumor thickness. The problem provides a precise definition: 'Depth of invasion (tumor thickness) for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is defined as the perpendicular distance from the top of the adjacent non-ulcerated epidermal granular layer to the deepest point of invasive tumor.' It then provides the corresponding measurement from the histologic sections: 'the perpendicular distance from the top of the adjacent non-ulcerated granular layer to this deepest front is measured as $7 \\,\\text{mm}$.' By direct application of the given definition to the given measurement, the tumor thickness is exactly $7 \\,\\text{mm}$. The problem requires this value to be expressed to two significant figures. The number $7$ has one significant figure. To express it with two significant figures, we write it as $7.0$. Therefore, the thickness to be reported is $7.0 \\,\\text{mm}$.\n\nSecond, we determine the 'beyond-subcutis indicator'. The problem defines this concept: 'The subcutis refers to subcutaneous fat. \"Invasion beyond subcutis\" means infiltration extending into structures deeper than subcutaneous fat (for example fascia, skeletal muscle, cartilage, or bone).' The problem then describes the findings of the histologic examination: 'Tumor nests are present within subcutaneous fat, but there is no histologic evidence of infiltration into fascia, skeletal muscle, cartilage, or bone.' This statement explicitly confirms that the tumor invades the subcutis (subcutaneous fat) but explicitly negates invasion into the structures that define 'beyond subcutis' (fascia, skeletal muscle, etc.). Therefore, invasion beyond the subcutis is not present. The problem specifies the indicator system: '$1$ if invasion beyond subcutis is present and $0$ if it is not.' Since invasion beyond the subcutis is not present, the indicator value must be $0$.\n\nFinally, we assemble the answer into the specified format: a two-entry row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix}\\text{thickness in mm} & \\text{beyond-subcutis indicator}\\end{pmatrix}$.

All provided data points are standard parameters used in oncologic pathology and are internally consistent. The problem is a direct application of a formal classification system and is therefore valid.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe T category for CSCC of the head and neck is determined by a hierarchical assessment of tumor size and high-risk features. The definitions for the relevant T categories (T1 through T4) according to the AJCC $8^\\text{th}$ edition are as follows:\n\n- **T1:** Tumor $\\le 2$ cm in greatest dimension with fewer than $2$ high-risk features.\n- **T2:** Tumor $> 2$ cm and $\\le 4$ cm in greatest dimension with fewer than $2$ high-risk features, OR tumor of any size with $2$ or more high-risk features.\n- **T3:** Tumor with any of the following features:\n    - Size $> 4$ cm in greatest dimension\n    - Minor bone erosion\n    - Perineural invasion of a nerve with a caliber $\\ge 0.1$ mm or any named nerve\n    - Deep invasion, defined as invasion beyond the subcutaneous tissue or a thickness $> 6$ mm.\n- **T4a:** Tumor with gross cortical bone or bone marrow invasion.\n- **T4b:** Tumor with skull base invasion and/or skull base foramen involvement.\n\nThe staging is hierarchical. If a tumor meets a criterion for a higher T category, that category is assigned, irrespective of whether it also meets criteria for a lower category.\n\nWe will now analyze the patient's tumor characteristics against these criteria:\n\n1.  **Tumor Size:** The greatest dimension is $3.5$ cm. This is greater than the $2$ cm threshold for T1 and falls within the $> 2$ cm to $\\le 4$ cm range relevant for T2. By size alone, it is at least a T2 tumor.\n\n2.  **High-Risk Features (for T1/T2):** Let us identify the \"high-risk features\" present in this tumor. These include: (a) thickness $> 2$ mm, (b) Clark level $\\ge$ IV, (c) PNI, (d) location on ear or non-hair-bearing lip, and (e) poor differentiation.\n    - The thickness is $8$ mm, which is $> 2$ mm. (Present)\n    - Invasion into subcutaneous fat corresponds to Clark level V. (Present)\n    - PNI is present. (Present)\n    The tumor has at least $3$ high-risk features. According to the T2 definition (\"tumor of any size with $\\ge 2$ high-risk features\"), the tumor qualifies as T2. However, we must check for T3 and T4 criteria.\n\n3.  **T3 Criteria Assessment:** We must now check if any T3 criteria are met, as these would upstage the tumor from T2.\n    - **Size > 4 cm?** No, the tumor is $3.5$ cm.\n    - **Minor bone erosion?** No, bone invasion is explicitly ruled out.\n    - **PNI of nerve $\\ge 0.1$ mm?** Yes. The problem states PNI involves a nerve with a caliber of $0.15$ mm, which satisfies the $\\ge 0.1$ mm criterion. This feature alone is sufficient to classify the tumor as T3.\n    - **Deep invasion (thickness > 6 mm)?** Yes. The tumor thickness is measured at $8$ mm, which is greater than the $6$ mm threshold. This feature is also, by itself, sufficient to classify the tumor as T3.\n\n4.  **T4 Criteria Assessment:**\n    - **T4a (gross bone/marrow invasion):** This is explicitly ruled out.\n    - **T4b (skull base invasion):** This is explicitly ruled out.\n\n**Conclusion:** The tumor exhibits two distinct features that independently meet the criteria for a T3 classification: (1) perineural invasion of a nerve with a caliber $\\ge 0.1$ mm, and (2) a thickness of $8$ mm, which qualifies as \"deep invasion\". Because the staging system is hierarchical, the presence of these T3-defining features makes the tumor a T3, overriding the T2 classification that might be considered based on size and number of high-risk features alone.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **A. T1:** Incorrect. The tumor size of $3.5$ cm exceeds the $\\le 2$ cm limit for T1.\n- **B. T2:** Incorrect. Although the tumor's size ($3.5$ cm) and aggregation of high-risk features satisfy criteria for a T2 designation, it is upstaged due to the presence of specific T3-defining features. The highest applicable T category must be assigned.\n- **C. T3:** Correct. The tumor meets the criteria for T3 based on two separate findings: perineural invasion of a nerve with a caliber of $0.15$ mm (which is $\\ge 0.1$ mm) and a measured thickness of $8$ mm (which is $> 6$ mm, qualifying as \"deep invasion\").\n- **D.
