It is a well-posed, self-contained biophysical modeling problem. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to determine the cleavage plane by comparing the adhesion strength at two different interfaces with the applied shear stress. The calculation proceeds as follows:\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial adhesion strength of the basal–suprabasal interface, $S_{bs}$, using the provided equation and parameter values.\n$$\nS_{bs} = \\alpha_{3}\\,c_{3b}\\,c_{3s} + \\alpha_{1}\\,c_{1b}\\,c_{1s}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nS_{bs} = (1)(8)(2) + (0.2)(2)(8) = 16 + 3.2 = 19.2 \\text{ AAU}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the adhesion strength of the suprabasal–superficial interface, $S_{ss}$.\n$$\nS_{ss} = \\beta_{1}\\,c_{1s}^{2} + \\beta_{3}\\,c_{3s}^{2}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nS_{ss} = (1)(8)^{2} + (0.1)(2)^{2} = (1)(64) + (0.1)(4) = 64 + 0.4 = 64.4 \\text{ AAU}\n$$\n\nThe problem states that anti-Dsg$3$ antibodies reduce the basal–suprabasal adhesion strength. The post-antibody strength, $S_{bs}^{(\\text{Ab})}$, is calculated as:\n$$\nS_{bs}^{(\\text{Ab})} = (1 - 0.60) \\, S_{bs}\n$$\nUsing the calculated value of $S_{bs}$:\n$$\nS_{bs}^{(\\text{Ab})} = (0.40) \\times 19.2 = 7.68 \\text{ AAU}\n$$\nThe suprabasal–superficial strength, $S_{ss}$, remains unchanged at $64.4$ AAU.\n\nThe failure criterion is that cleavage occurs where the applied shear stress, $T = 10$ AAU, exceeds the local adhesion strength, $S$. We must check this condition at both interfaces after the antibody action.\n\n1.  **At the basal–suprabasal interface:**\n    We compare the applied stress $T$ with the post-antibody strength $S_{bs}^{(\\text{Ab})}$.\n    Is $T > S_{bs}^{(\\text{Ab})}$?\n    Is $10 > 7.68$? Yes.\n    Therefore, the stress is sufficient to cause failure at the basal–suprabasal interface.\n\n2.  **At the suprabasal–superficial interface:**\n    We compare the applied stress $T$ with the strength $S_{ss}$.\n    Is $T > S_{ss}$?\n    Is $10 > 64.4$? No.\n    Therefore, the stress is insufficient to cause failure at the suprabasal–superficial interface.\n\nSince the applied stress exceeds the adhesion strength only at the basal–suprabasal interface, mechanical failure will occur at this location. This corresponds to a suprabasal split.\n\nAccording to the output convention provided in the problem statement:\n- Code $1$ denotes cleavage at the basal–suprabasal interface.\n- Code $2$ denotes cleavage at the suprabasal–superficial interface.\n\nThe predicted cleavage plane is the basal–suprabasal interface, which corresponds to the integer code $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "4429998"}, {"introduction": "Diagnosing a rare disease like pemphigus vulgaris requires a nuanced interpretation of test results.
