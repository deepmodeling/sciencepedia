This first practice exercise challenges you to apply the classic definition of Erythema Multiforme (EM) to a clinical vignette. By analyzing the lesion type, its location, and the absence of other key signs, you will practice the crucial skill of differentiating EM from its common mimics, such as morbilliform drug eruptions and more severe conditions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome [@problem_id:4438837].", "problem": "A $24$-year-old man presents with an acute pruritic eruption that began on the backs of his hands and feet and has spread to the extensor forearms and legs over $24$ hours. The trunk is largely spared. Ten days ago he started amoxicillin for acute sinusitis. He denies fever, malaise, ocular symptoms, genital discomfort, or oral pain. On examination, there are multiple well-demarcated “target” lesions with three concentric zones of color change and a central dusky area on the dorsal hands and extensor forearms; similar lesions are on the feet. There are no bullae, no erosions, and no appreciable mucosal involvement. Lateral pressure on perilesional skin does not induce epidermal sloughing (Nikolsky sign is negative). \n\nUsing core clinical definitions of erythema multiforme (EM) and morbilliform drug eruption, and the mechanistic basis for the Nikolsky sign, which of the following is the most likely classification of this eruption and the best justification for it?\n\nA. Erythema multiforme (EM) minor triggered by drug exposure; the presence of true three-zone target lesions with acral predominance and a negative Nikolsky sign favors EM over a morbilliform exanthem, which typically presents with diffuse blanchable macules and papules starting on the trunk without true targets.\n\nB. Morbilliform drug eruption due to amoxicillin; the approximately $10$-day latency and antibiotic exposure are decisive, and morbilliform eruptions frequently feature true target lesions with acral onset and trunk sparing.\n\nC. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) secondary to amoxicillin; targetoid lesions in the setting of a new drug exposure point to SJS, and a negative Nikolsky sign is characteristic.\n\nD. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS); the timing after drug initiation and widespread eruption with systemic immune activation best explain the findings even without mucosal disease.\n\nE. Erythema multiforme (EM) major; the presence of target lesions with acral predominance implies EM with significant mucosal involvement even if mucosal symptoms are not reported.", "solution": "The diagnosis is established by systematically analyzing the key clinical features presented in the vignette:\n\n1.  **Lesion Morphology**: The patient has \"multiple well-demarcated 'target' lesions with three concentric zones of color change and a central dusky area.\" These are the \"typical\" or \"classic\" target lesions that are pathognomonic for Erythema Multiforme (EM). Other conditions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) typically feature \"atypical targets\" (flat, two-zoned, indistinct). Morbilliform eruptions consist of macules and papules, not target lesions.\n\n2.  **Lesion Distribution**: The eruption is acral (hands, feet) and on extensor surfaces, with the trunk spared. This is the classic distribution for EM. Morbilliform drug eruptions typically begin on the trunk.\n\n3.  **Mucosal and Systemic Symptoms**: The patient has no mucosal involvement and no systemic symptoms (fever, malaise). This clinical picture is consistent with **Erythema Multiforme minor**. The presence of significant mucosal erosions and systemic toxicity would be required for a diagnosis of EM major or SJS.\n\n4.  **Nikolsky Sign**: The sign is negative, meaning there is no widespread loss of epidermal cohesion. A positive Nikolsky sign is a hallmark of SJS and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), reflecting full-thickness epidermal necrosis. Its absence is consistent with EM.\n\n5.  **Trigger**: The eruption occurred 10 days after starting amoxicillin. While infections (especially HSV) are the most common cause of EM, drugs are a well-known trigger, and the latency period is appropriate for a drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of typical three-zone target lesions, acral distribution, absence of mucosal or systemic symptoms, and a negative Nikolsky sign provides the classic clinical picture of Erythema Multiforme minor.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n-   **A: Correct.** This option accurately identifies the condition as EM minor, notes the plausible drug trigger, and correctly justifies the diagnosis based on the presence of true target lesions, acral distribution, and a negative Nikolsky sign, while correctly contrasting these features with a morbilliform eruption.\n\n-   **B: Incorrect.** This option misidentifies the eruption. Morbilliform eruptions do not feature true target lesions and typically start on the trunk.\n\n-   **C: Incorrect.** This diagnosis is excluded by the absence of mucosal erosions and the negative Nikolsky sign. The statement that a negative Nikolsky sign is characteristic of SJS is false.\n\n-   **D: Incorrect.** DRESS is a severe systemic illness with fever and internal organ involvement, both of which are absent here. The rash in DRESS is also typically morbilliform, not targetoid.\n\n-   **E: Incorrect.** The diagnosis of EM major requires significant mucosal involvement, which is explicitly absent. The skin findings do not imply mucosal disease when it is clinically ruled out.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4438837"}, {"introduction": "After identifying a disease pattern, the clinician's next task is to determine the cause. This exercise simulates a common and complex diagnostic challenge: a patient with multiple potential triggers for an eruption. You must act as a clinical detective, using a detailed timeline to evaluate the plausibility of each potential cause based on established latency periods and known associations, thereby honing your skills in causal attribution [@problem_id:4716543].", "problem": "A patient presents to an oral medicine clinic with acute-onset mucosal and cutaneous lesions. The fundamental base is that erythema multiforme (EM) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) are delayed-type hypersensitivity disorders mediated predominantly by cytotoxic T lymphocytes against either infectious antigens or drug-modified keratinocytes, and are characterized by characteristic latency from trigger to onset, distinct lesion morphology, and gradations of epidermal detachment by body surface area (BSA). A parsimonious causal hypothesis must satisfy temporal precedence (the cause must precede the effect) and plausibility (compatible with known triggers, latency ranges, and morphology).\n\nTimeline (days relative to the index day of symptom onset, defined as day $0$):\n- Day $-20$: Initiation of lamotrigine for mood stabilization; no prior exposure documented.\n- Day $-6$: Cluster of vesicular lesions on the vermilion of the upper lip with tingling and pain, clinically diagnosed as herpes simplex virus type $1$ (HSV-$1$) labialis; spontaneous crusting by day $-4$; no systemic therapy taken.\n- Day $-3$: Dental restoration and placement of a subgingival matrix; initiation of amoxicillin $500$ mg three times daily; the patient reports no prior exposure to amoxicillin.\n- Day $0$: Appearance of multiple acral targetoid papules with three concentric zones, predominantly on the dorsal hands and extensor forearms; lips with hemorrhagic crusting; oral mucosa with diffuse erythema and shallow erosions covered by yellow-white pseudomembranes; odynophagia; fever to $38.2^\\circ\\text{C}$.\n- Day $+1$: Dermatology consultation estimates epidermal detachment by BSA $5\\%$; Nikolsky sign is negative on uninvolved skin; ocular examination is normal; no genital mucosal involvement.\n\nNo other new drugs, no recent upper respiratory tract infection aside from the HSV-$1$ episode, and no travel. Laboratory screening for Mycoplasma pneumoniae is pending.\n\nWhich causal hypothesis best satisfies temporal precedence and plausibility for this presentation, considering the differential diagnosis between EM (including EM major) and SJS/TEN?\n\nA. Erythema multiforme major precipitated by herpes simplex virus reactivation approximately $5$–$6$ days prior to onset.\n\nB. Stevens-Johnson syndrome induced by lamotrigine initiated approximately $20$ days prior to onset.\n\nC. Erythema multiforme induced by first-time exposure to amoxicillin initiated approximately $3$ days prior to onset.\n\nD. Toxic epidermal necrolysis due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection beginning approximately $2$–$3$ days prior to onset.", "solution": "The solution requires a two-step process: first, establishing the most likely diagnosis on the erythema multiforme (EM) to Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) spectrum based on clinical signs; and second, identifying the most plausible trigger by evaluating the temporal relationship of each potential cause.\n\n**1. Establishing the Diagnosis**\n\nThe clinical presentation points strongly to **Erythema Multiforme major**:\n-   **Lesion Morphology**: The patient has \"acral targetoid papules with three concentric zones.\" These are classic target lesions, the hallmark of EM, not the atypical targets or macules of SJS.\n-   **Mucosal Involvement**: There is significant oral mucositis, fulfilling the criteria for \"major\" disease. However, the involvement is limited to one mucosal surface (oral), whereas SJS typically involves two or more.\n-   **Epidermal Detachment**: Detachment is minimal ($5\\%$ BSA) and the Nikolsky sign is negative. This indicates epidermal injury is not widespread or full-thickness, arguing against SJS, which is characterized by epidermal instability and often a positive Nikolsky sign.\n\n**2. Evaluating Causal Triggers**\n\nWe assess the plausibility of each potential trigger based on the latency period from exposure to the onset of the eruption on Day $0$.\n\n-   **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1)**: An outbreak occurred on Day $-6$, giving a latency of **6 days**. This falls perfectly within the typical 3- to 14-day window for post-herpetic EM. HSV is the most common known precipitant of EM.\n-   **Lamotrigine**: The drug was started on Day $-20$, giving a latency of **20 days**. While this is a plausible timeframe for a drug reaction, lamotrigine is much more strongly associated with SJS/TEN, and the clinical phenotype here is clearly EM major.\n-   **Amoxicillin**: The drug was started on Day $-3$, giving a latency of only **3 days**. For a first-time exposure, this is an implausibly short interval for a T-cell-mediated (Type IV) hypersensitivity reaction to develop.\n-   ***Mycoplasma pneumoniae***: This is purely speculative, as there are no symptoms of a respiratory infection and lab results are pending.\n\n**Conclusion**: The diagnosis is EM major, and the most plausible trigger is the HSV-1 reactivation due to the classic clinical picture and the ideal latency period.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n-   **A: Correct.** This hypothesis correctly identifies the diagnosis as EM major and attributes it to the HSV reactivation, supported by a perfect temporal link (6-day latency) and strong epidemiological association.\n\n-   **B: Incorrect.** This hypothesis misidentifies the disease as SJS. The clinical findings (classic targets, negative Nikolsky sign) are inconsistent with SJS.\n\n-   **C: Incorrect.** This hypothesis proposes an implausibly short latency period (3 days) for a primary drug-induced T-cell mediated reaction.\n\n-   **D: Incorrect.** This hypothesis misidentifies the disease as TEN (which requires $>30\\%$ BSA detachment) and relies on a speculative, unsubstantiated trigger (*Mycoplasma*).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4716543"}, {"introduction": "Clinical diagnosis is often a process of refining probabilities rather than reaching absolute certainty.

You are considering erythema multiforme (EM) versus Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN). Erythema multiforme (EM) is classically associated with fixed target lesions with three distinct zones, frequently triggered by herpes simplex virus, and typically lacks epidermal detachment. Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) is a severe drug-mediated epidermal necrolysis spectrum disease characterized by widespread dusky macules, sheet-like epidermal detachment, and a positive Nikolsky sign. The Nikolsky sign is defined as epidermal sloughing induced by gentle lateral pressure.\n\nYou have an institutional registry describing the base rates among similar presentations (fever, mucositis, and scattered targets) in the absence of widespread epidermal detachment: of $20$ consecutively adjudicated cases, $13$ were EM major and $7$ were SJS/TEN. In a prospective quality-improvement cohort of confirmed cases, the probability of a negative Nikolsky sign among EM was measured as $96$ out of $100$ cases, and among SJS/TEN as $12$ out of $100$ cases. In the current patient, the Nikolsky sign is negative.\n\nUsing these data as pretest probabilities and operating characteristics, apply Bayes’ theorem to compute the posterior probability that the diagnosis is EM given the negative Nikolsky sign.

We will formalize the update from prior to posterior probability using Bayes’ theorem.\n\nFirst, identify the prior probabilities from the institutional registry. Among $20$ similar cases, $13$ were EM and $7$ were SJS/TEN.
