This practice challenges you to build a systematic checklist to distinguish benign nevi from melanoma, focusing on lesions from special sites or those affected by trauma, which can often display misleading, atypical features. Mastering this skill is essential for developing diagnostic confidence and avoiding the critical error of overcalling a benign lesion as malignant [@problem_id:4403926].", "problem": "A dermatopathology trainee is evaluating a Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)–stained shave biopsy from acral skin of a $35$-year-old patient. The clinical history mentions recent frictional trauma to a long-standing pigmented macule. At scanning magnification, the lesion appears overall symmetric and well circumscribed. Histologic features include irregularly distributed junctional nests with focal single melanocytes along the dermoepidermal junction, a central area of limited upward scatter of melanocytes, mild cytologic atypia, superficial dermal fibroplasia, melanophages, and patchy inflammation. In the dermis, nests become progressively smaller with descent, and the nuclei of melanocytes appear smaller and more uniform in deeper levels. No atypical mitotic figures are identified in the deep dermis. There is no necrosis en masse, no perineural or lymphovascular invasion, and adnexal structures are preserved.\n\nYour task is to construct a histology-driven checklist to minimize false-positive diagnoses of melanoma in special site nevi (e.g., acral, genital, flexural) or traumatized nevi. Begin from core definitions of benign versus malignant neoplasia in tissue pathology: benign melanocytic lesions typically show maturation with descent, architectural symmetry, circumscription, proportionate stromal response, and limited mitotic activity, whereas melanoma typically exhibits asymmetry, poor circumscription, confluent growth, widespread pagetoid spread, destructive invasion, deep dermal atypical mitoses, and necrosis en masse. Using these fundamental distinctions, select ALL items that should be included as safeguards in a practical checklist to reduce overcalling special site or traumatized nevi as melanoma.\n\nOptions:\nA. Require documentation of progressive dermal maturation of melanocytes with descent, including decreased cell and nuclear size and reduced nest size in deeper dermis.\n\nB. Verify absence of broad, continuous confluent lentiginous growth or bridging of adjacent rete ridges across wide spans.\n\nC. Confirm symmetry and sharp lateral circumscription at low magnification ($\\times 2$–$\\times 4$), with peripheral tapering of junctional activity.\n\nD.

Check for lack of destructive invasive growth, necrosis en masse, and perineural or lymphovascular invasion as a safeguard against melanoma overcall.\n\nH. Emphasize high-power cytologic atypia as the primary discriminator and deprioritize architecture, symmetry, and maturation in the overall assessment.", "solution": "The goal is to derive, from foundational principles of neoplasia in tissue pathology, which safeguards belong in a checklist designed to prevent overcalling special site nevi or traumatized nevi as melanoma. The fundamental base is the well-tested distinction between benign and malignant melanocytic lesions: benign nevi classically show maturation with descent, architectural symmetry, sharp circumscription, proportionate stromal responses, and limited mitotic activity; melanoma shows architectural disorder (asymmetry, poor circumscription), confluent growth, diffuse pagetoid spread, destructive invasion, deep dermal atypical mitoses, and necrosis en masse. Special site nevi (e.g., acral, genital, flexural, and mucosal sites) and traumatized nevi can display atypical features that mimic melanoma (such as focal pagetoid spread, lentiginous growth, dermal fibroplasia, melanophages, and mild cytologic atypia), yet remain benign when the core benign signatures are present. The World Health Organization (WHO) classification and extensive dermatopathology literature emphasize that recognition of maturation, symmetry, circumscription, absence of deep atypical mitoses, and lack of destructive invasion are the key guardrails that supersede focal reactive or site-related atypia.\n\nApplying these principles, we evaluate each option:\n\nA. Require documentation of progressive dermal maturation of melanocytes with descent, including decreased cell and nuclear size and reduced nest size in deeper dermis.\nAnalysis: Dermal maturation—characterized by decreasing cell/nuclear size, smaller nests, and often increased stromal separation with depth—is a cornerstone of benign nevi. Malignant melanoma typically lacks maturation and may show similar cell size throughout the depth with expansile growth. Including this as a safeguard is directly aligned with the fundamental base of benign versus malignant architecture.\nVerdict: Correct.\n\nB. Verify absence of broad, continuous confluent lentiginous growth or bridging of adjacent rete ridges across wide spans.\nAnalysis: Confluent lentiginous growth and broad rete ridge bridging are hallmarks of architectural disorder typical of melanoma and some dysplastic proliferations. While special site nevi may have focal lentiginous features, broad continuous confluence is concerning. A checklist safeguard emphasizing lack of extensive confluence directly guards against overcalling a benign variant as melanoma by requiring architectural restraint.\nVerdict: Correct.\n\nC. Confirm symmetry and sharp lateral circumscription at low magnification ($\\times 2$–$\\times 4$), with peripheral tapering of junctional activity.\nAnalysis: Low-power symmetry and circumscription are fundamental benign signatures. Special site and traumatized nevi can retain symmetry and tapering at the periphery, even when focal atypia exists centrally. Melanoma often lacks symmetry and peripheral tapering. Using low-power architecture as a safeguard is appropriate and aligns with first principles.\nVerdict: Correct.\n\nD. Ensure mitotic figures, if present, are restricted to the superficial component and absent in the deep dermis, especially away from ulceration or trauma.\nAnalysis: In benign nevi, mitoses are uncommon and, if present, tend to be superficial and related to reactive changes (e.g., near ulceration). Deep dermal atypical mitoses, particularly away from trauma, favor melanoma. Therefore, checking for absence of deep dermal mitoses is a critical safeguard. Recognizing trauma-associated superficial mitoses prevents misinterpretation.\nVerdict: Correct.\n\nE. Explicitly account for site-specific variants and trauma-related reactive changes (epidermal hyperplasia, dermal fibroplasia, hemorrhage, melanophages) so they are not misinterpreted as melanoma.\nAnalysis: Special sites (acral, genital, flexural) are known to have atypical but benign patterns; trauma introduces reactive changes that can mimic malignancy. A checklist item that forces recognition of these contexts prevents overdiagnosis by anchoring interpretation in site- and injury-related biology rather than assuming malignant patterns. This is strongly supported by foundational principles of lesion context and reactive pathology.\nVerdict: Correct.\n\nF. Accept diffuse, full-thickness pagetoid spread of melanocytes extending to the lateral edges as a benign variant that should not weigh against nevus.\nAnalysis: While special site nevi (and some Spitz nevi) may have focal, central pagetoid spread, diffuse full-thickness pagetoid scatter to the lateral edges is a classic red flag for melanoma. Including this statement would undermine the safeguard concept; it incorrectly normalizes a malignant pattern. Therefore, this is not an appropriate checklist item.\nVerdict: Incorrect.\n\nG. Check for lack of destructive invasive growth, necrosis en masse, and perineural or lymphovascular invasion as a safeguard against melanoma overcall.\nAnalysis: Destructive invasion into adnexal structures or nerves, necrosis en masse, and vascular invasion are malignant features, absent in benign nevi. Their absence is a key reassurance. A checklist item explicitly calling for their absence is a valid safeguard grounded in first principles of malignant behavior.\nVerdict: Correct.\n\nH. Emphasize high-power cytologic atypia as the primary discriminator and deprioritize architecture, symmetry, and maturation in the overall assessment.\nAnalysis: Overreliance on high-power cytology without architectural context is a common pitfall. Cytologic atypia can be present in special site and traumatized nevi; architecture and maturation are the more reliable discriminators between benign and malignant melanocytic lesions. This option advocates a flawed approach and should not be included as a safeguard.\nVerdict: Incorrect.\n\nSynthesizing from these analyses, the appropriate checklist safeguards are A, B, C, D, E, and G.

This exercise introduces the Ki-67 proliferation index, a tool used to measure the percentage of cells actively dividing within a lesion. By calculating and interpreting the Ki-67 index, you will learn how to quantitatively support a diagnosis of a benign nevus, which is characterized by low proliferative activity, in contrast to the high proliferation typical of melanoma [@problem_id:4403946].", "problem": "A dermatopathology laboratory receives a shave biopsy of a $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ pigmented macule from the back of a $28$-year-old patient. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) sections show a symmetric, well-circumscribed lesion with predominantly nested junctional melanocytes and small, uniform dermal nests. There is maturation with descent, absence of significant cytologic atypia, and no dermal mitoses identified. To objectively assess proliferative activity, the pathologist performs Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the nuclear antigen Ki-67, which is known to be expressed in cells traversing the $G_1$, $S$, $G_2$, and $M$ phases of the cell cycle, but not in quiescent $G_0$ cells.\n\nIn two representative regions of interest, the pathologist counts only melanocytes (excluding keratinocytes, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells) and records the following:\n\n- Junctional component: total melanocytes $n_j = 160$, Ki-67 positive melanocytes $x_j = 9$.\n- Dermal component: total melanocytes $n_d = 240$, Ki-67 positive melanocytes $x_d = 7$.\n\nLet the overall Ki-67 proliferation index be defined as $k = \\dfrac{x_j + x_d}{n_j + n_d} \\times 100\\%$.\n\nWhich option best explains, from first principles, how the quantified Ki-67 proliferation index supports a benign melanocytic nevus diagnosis when $k < 5\\%$, in contrast to typically higher indices seen in melanoma?\n\nA. Ki-67 marks nuclei in active cell cycle phases ($G_1$, $S$, $G_2$, $M$).

The description of a benign compound nevus (junctional and dermal components) is classic. The use of Ki-67 as a marker for cellular proliferation is a standard ancillary technique in pathology. The stated biology of Ki-67 antigen expression is correct. The fundamental premise that benign nevi have low proliferative activity while melanomas have high proliferative activity is a cornerstone of melanocytic pathology. All information is scientifically sound.\n*   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data to calculate the Ki-67 index and asks for a conceptual explanation of its interpretation, which is a standard task in medical science education.

There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n*   **Consistency and Completeness:** The provided data are internally consistent and complete for the task. The histomorphologic description points towards a benign nevus, and the question asks how the quantitative Ki-67 data support this impression. There are no contradictions. The quantitative values ($n_j, x_j, n_d, x_d$) are plausible for representative high-power fields in such a lesion.\n*   **Realism:** The clinical scenario, histologic findings, and quantitative data are entirely realistic.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and consistent. I will now proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem is to explain the biological and pathological significance of the Ki-67 proliferation index in the differential diagnosis of melanocytic lesions.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the overall Ki-67 proliferation index, $k$, using the provided formula and data:\nTotal melanocytes counted, $n_{total} = n_j + n_d = 160 + 240 = 400$.\nTotal Ki-67 positive melanocytes counted, $x_{total} = x_j + x_d = 9 + 7 = 16$.\n\nThe proliferation index $k$ is:\n$$k = \\dfrac{x_{total}}{n_{total}} \\times 100\\% = \\dfrac{16}{400} \\times 100\\% = 0.04 \\times 100\\% = 4\\%$$\n\nThe calculated index is $k=4\\%$, which is less than the $5\\%$ threshold mentioned in the question. This confirms the premise of the question.\n\nNow, let's explain the underlying principles.\n1.  **Cell Cycle and Ki-67:** The Ki-67 protein is a nuclear marker strictly associated with cellular proliferation. Its presence indicates that a cell is in one of the active phases of the cell cycle ($G_1$, $S$, $G_2$, or $M$). Its absence in a viable, differentiated cell typically implies a quiescent state ($G_0$). The Ki-67 index, therefore, provides a quantitative snapshot of the fraction of cells in a given population that are actively proliferating.\n2.  **Biology of Benign Nevi:** Benign melanocytic nevi are clonal proliferations of melanocytes that undergo a programmed process of growth and subsequent growth arrest, often termed \"senescence\" or \"maturation\". Initially, there is proliferation at the dermo-epidermal junction. As nests of melanocytes drop into the dermis, they typically \"mature\"—they become smaller, produce less pigment, and, crucially, exit the cell cycle to enter the quiescent $G_0$ state. This cessation of proliferation is a key self-limiting feature that defines the lesion as benign. Consequently, a stable benign nevus will have a very low proportion of Ki-67-positive melanocytes.\n3.  **Biology of Malignant Melanoma:** Malignant melanoma is characterized by the breakdown of normal cell cycle controls. Melanoma cells acquire mutations that allow them to bypass growth arrest signals and proliferate in an uncontrolled manner. This results in a significantly larger fraction of the tumor cell population being in active cell cycle phases. Therefore, melanomas typically exhibit a much higher Ki-67 proliferation index compared to benign nevi.\n4.  **Diagnostic Interpretation:** The histomorphologic features described in the problem (symmetry, circumscription, maturation with descent, lack of atypia and mitoses) are all classic signs of a benign nevus. The a low Ki-67 index of $k=4\\%$ provides strong, objective, quantitative support for this morphologic impression. It demonstrates that the vast majority ($96\\%$) of the melanocytes in the lesion are quiescent ($G_0$), which is the expected biological state for a benign nevus. While thresholds can vary, an index below $5\\%$ is widely accepted as indicative of low proliferative activity, consistent with a benign diagnosis. Conversely, a high index (e.g., $>10-20\\%$) would be a red flag for melanoma, prompting greater concern even in the face of otherwise reassuring features. It is critical to emphasize that the Ki-67 index is an *ancillary* tool and must be interpreted in conjunction with the primary histomorphologic findings and clinical context.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Ki-67 marks nuclei in active cell cycle phases ($G_1$, $S$, $G_2$, $M$). Benign nevi melanocytes are largely in $G_0$ due to growth arrest and maturation, yielding low $k$; melanoma has a larger fraction of cycling melanocytes, yielding higher $k$. A measured $k$ below approximately $5\\%$ across melanocytes, derived from the stated counts, supports a benign nevus, while acknowledging that interpretation must consider architecture, cytology, and correct cell-type–specific counting.**\nThis option accurately describes the function of Ki-67, correctly contrasts the cell cycle kinetics of benign nevi and melanoma, and relates this to the expected low Ki-67 index ($k$). Crucially, it correctly contextualizes the quantitative data as supportive evidence that must be integrated with morphology and proper methodology. This explanation is comprehensive and correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Any nonzero Ki-67 positivity conclusively proves melanoma because truly benign nevi melanocytes cannot express Ki-67; therefore, if $k > 0\\%$, the lesion is malignant regardless of histology.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. Benign lesions and normal tissues contain proliferating cells for growth and maintenance. A small number of cycling melanocytes is expected in many benign nevi. A Ki-67 proliferation index is a quantitative measure, not a binary one. Stating that any positivity is proof of malignancy and that it overrides histology is a dangerous oversimplification that contradicts fundamental pathological principles.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The Ki-67 index should be computed by counting all nuclei (including keratinocytes and inflammatory cells) in the field to better reflect overall lesion proliferation; restricting the count to melanocytes underestimates $k$ and may falsely favor a benign diagnosis.**\nThis describes an incorrect methodology. The purpose of the test is to assess the proliferation of the melanocytic population, which is the cell of interest. Including non-melanocytic cells (like keratinocytes or lymphocytes) would contaminate the data and make the index uninterpretable for its intended purpose. The proliferation rate of adjacent keratinocytes or an inflammatory infiltrate is irrelevant to the intrinsic proliferation rate of the nevus cells. The specified method of counting only melanocytes is the correct approach.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. A single field demonstrating $k \\approx 3.7\\%$ independently establishes the benign diagnosis and obviates the need to integrate morphologic features, clinical context, or to consider sampling error.**\n(Note: The calculated value is $k=4\\%$). This option commits a cardinal error in pathology by suggesting that a single ancillary test can \"independently establish\" a diagnosis and \"obviate\" the need for clinicopathologic correlation. Diagnosis in pathology is an integrative process. Morphology (H&E) is the cornerstone, and ancillary tests like Ki-67 provide supportive evidence. Ignoring morphology, clinical context, and potential sampling bias is a recipe for diagnostic error.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Ki-67 does not reliably stain melanocytes; thus, low Ki-67 positivity in melanocytic lesions primarily indicates technical failure rather than true low proliferation, and cannot support a benign diagnosis.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. Ki-67 is a universal marker of proliferation in mammalian cells, including melanocytes, and is a standard, reliable IHC stain used in this context. While any IHC stain can fail for technical reasons, pathologists use on-slide internal and external controls to ensure the stain has worked correctly. When technically adequate, a low Ki-67 index is a true biological finding of low proliferation, not an artifact.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4403946"}, {"introduction": "Some cases present significant diagnostic challenges where morphology is ambiguous, such as distinguishing a recurrent nevus in a scar from a nevoid melanoma.

Fibroblasts are negative.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the following criteria:\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly rooted in diagnostic dermatopathology. The scenario—distinguishing a recurrent/persistent nevus from a melanoma in a scar—is a common and challenging clinical problem. The use of immunohistochemistry with markers like SOX$10$, Melan-A, and $p16$ is standard practice for this differential diagnosis. The described functions and staining patterns of these markers are consistent with established scientific literature. Specifically, SOX$10$ and Melan-A are well-known melanocytic lineage markers. The protein $p16^{\\text{INK4A}}$, encoded by the *CDKN2A* tumor suppressor gene, is a critical cell cycle regulator. Its loss of expression, typically due to homozygous gene deletion, is a hallmark of progression to melanoma, whereas its expression is retained (and often upregulated) in benign nevi due to oncogene-induced senescence. The description of internal controls (Schwann cells for SOX$10$, keratinocytes for $p16$) and their expected behavior confirms a technically valid IHC assay.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear clinical context, specific histopathological findings, a precise differential diagnosis, and concrete ancillary data (IHC results). The question asks for a single best conclusion based on integrating these facts, which allows for a unique and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using objective, precise, and quantitative language (e.g., \"$>95\\%$\", \"mild nuclear enlargement\", \"absent staining\"). It is free of subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\nThe problem statement has no identifiable flaws. It does not violate scientific principles, is not incomplete or contradictory, is realistic, and is well-structured.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution will now be derived.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe central task is to interpret the provided immunohistochemistry results in the context of the clinical and histopathological findings to resolve the differential diagnosis between a benign intradermal nevus (potentially a recurrent nevus) and a nevoid melanoma.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Melanocytic Lineage Markers (SOX$10$ and Melan-A)**:\n    - The strong, diffuse nuclear positivity for SOX$10$ ($>95\\%$) and strong, diffuse cytoplasmic positivity for Melan-A ($>90\\%$) unequivocally confirm that the proliferating cells in the dermal scar are of melanocytic lineage.\n    - SOX$10$ is a highly sensitive and specific nuclear marker for melanocytes. Melan-A is a cytoplasmic marker that is also sensitive.\n    - However, both benign nevi and the vast majority of melanomas express these markers. Therefore, their positivity confirms the cell type but does not, in itself, distinguish between a benign and a malignant proliferation.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Cell Cycle Regulator Marker ($p16$)**:\n    - This marker is the key to resolving the differential diagnosis. The $p16^{\\text{INK4A}}$ protein is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that acts as a tumor suppressor by enforcing a cell cycle arrest (G1 arrest).\n    - **Expected finding in a benign nevus**: Benign melanocytic nevi are clonal proliferations, often driven by an activating mutation in a proto-oncogene like *BRAF*. This initial proliferation pressure is counteracted by a cellular defense mechanism called oncogene-induced senescence. This senescence program is mediated by tumor suppressor pathways, prominently involving the upregulation of $p16$. Consequently, benign nevi are expected to show strong and diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of $p16$.\n    - **Expected finding in melanoma**: For a nevus to progress to melanoma, it must bypass this senescence checkpoint. One of the most common genetic events in melanoma development is the inactivation of the *CDKN2A* gene, which codes for $p16$. This is most frequently accomplished via homozygous deletion of the gene locus. This genetic event leads to a complete loss of $p16$ protein expression.\n    - **Observed Result**: The lesional melanocytes show a complete absence of $p16$ staining ($0\\%$ positivity). Critically, the internal positive control—adjacent epidermal keratinocytes—shows strong nuclear staining. This validates the staining procedure and confirms that the lack of staining in the melanocytes is a true biological loss of the protein, not a technical failure (false negative).\n    - **Conclusion from $p16$**: The complete loss of $p16$ expression in a melanocytic proliferation, in the presence of a valid internal control, is a high-specificity indicator of malignancy and strongly favors a diagnosis of melanoma over a benign nevus.\n\n3.  **Synthesis and Final Conclusion**:\n    - The patient has a dermal melanocytic proliferation in a scar that is histologically ambiguous.\n    - IHC confirms the cells are melanocytes (SOX$10$+, Melan-A+).\n    - IHC demonstrates a complete loss of the $p16$ tumor suppressor protein.\n    - This constellation of findings—a melanocytic proliferation that has lost the key senescence-maintaining protein $p16$—is the molecular signature of melanoma. The histological description of \"small epithelioid melanocytes\" is compatible with a nevoid variant of melanoma, which can morphologically mimic a benign nevus.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The pattern supports nevoid melanoma: SOX$10$ and Melan-A confirm melanocytic lineage, and complete loss of $p16$ in lesional cells with intact internal controls indicates tumor suppressor pathway dysregulation consistent with melanoma.**\nThis option accurately summarizes the role of all markers. It correctly states that SOX$10$ and Melan-A establish the melanocytic nature of the cells. Most importantly, it correctly interprets the complete loss of $p16$ (with intact controls) as evidence of tumor suppressor pathway dysregulation, which is a key feature distinguishing melanoma from benign nevi. This conclusion is scientifically sound and directly supported by the provided data.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The pattern supports a benign intradermal nevus: positivity for SOX$10$ and Melan-A establishes benignity in scars, and $p16$ loss is a nonspecific artifact of fibrosis.**\nThis option is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, positivity for SOX$10$ and Melan-A does not establish benignity; it establishes melanocytic lineage, and melanomas are typically positive. Second, the claim that $p16$ loss is a \"nonspecific artifact of fibrosis\" is scientifically unfounded. Most critically, the presence of a strong internal positive control (the keratinocytes) definitively refutes the notion of an artifact or staining failure. The loss is a true biological finding. A benign nevus would be expected to be strongly $p16$ positive.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The pattern is nondiagnostic: $p16$ is not useful for this distinction; additional markers such as Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma (PRAME) are strictly required to classify the lesion.**\nThis option is incorrect. The assertion that \"$p16$ is not useful for this distinction\" is false; loss of $p16$ expression is one of the most powerful and widely used ancillary tests for identifying melanoma in difficult cases. The results are highly diagnostic, not nondiagnostic. While other markers like PRAME are also useful and can add confidence, the finding of complete $p16$ loss with internal controls is often sufficient evidence to render a diagnosis of melanoma. It is not \"strictly required\" to add more markers in the face of such a definitive result.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The pattern supports desmoplastic melanoma: strong Melan-A expression is typical of desmoplastic melanoma, which also often shows $p16$ loss.**\nThis option is incorrect because its primary premise is factually wrong. Strong and diffuse Melan-A expression ($>90\\%$) is characteristic of most conventional melanomas but is classically absent or only focally and weakly expressed in desmoplastic melanoma. Desmoplastic melanomas are more reliably identified by S$100$ and SOX$10$ positivity. The strong Melan-A result in this case argues strongly against a diagnosis of desmoplastic melanoma. Additionally, the morphology described (\"small epithelioid melanocytes\") does not fit the classic spindle cell morphology of desmoplastic melanoma.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4403939"}]}
