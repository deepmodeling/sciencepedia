In acute eczematous dermatitis, this barrier is often compromised, increasing susceptibility to irritants and allergens. This practice challenges you to quantify the degree of barrier impairment using Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) data and to translate this physical change into a probabilistic risk of eliciting an eczematous reaction in a sensitized individual [@problem_id:4315501].", "problem": "A cohort of individuals previously sensitized to a low molecular weight hapten undergoes controlled irritant exposure with an anionic detergent known to disrupt the stratum corneum barrier. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL), defined as the passive flux of water across the epidermis in steady state, is measured before and after exposure. Baseline TEWL is $8 \\text{ g}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-2}\\cdot\\text{h}^{-1}$ and rises to $24 \\text{ g}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-2}\\cdot\\text{h}^{-1}$ immediately after exposure. In acute eczematous dermatitis, barrier disruption increases percutaneous penetration and thereby increases the probability of elicitation upon re-exposure to the sensitizing antigen.\n\nAssume the following:\n- Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) is proportional to the effective permeability coefficient of the stratum corneum for small polar solutes under steady-state conditions.\n- Antigen flux $J$ through the stratum corneum scales linearly with TEWL, so that the ratio $J/J_{0}$ equals the ratio of post-exposure TEWL to baseline TEWL, where $J_{0}$ is the baseline antigen flux before irritant exposure.\n- In previously sensitized individuals, the elicitation threshold flux $T$ for the antigen is lognormally distributed across the population with median $J_{\\text{thr}} = 2 J_{0}$ and logarithmic standard deviation parameter $\\sigma = 0.5$.\n\nUsing these assumptions:\n1.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of dermatology and toxicology, specifically relating to contact dermatitis and skin barrier function. The concepts of Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL), haptens, irritant exposure, and dose-response thresholds are standard in this field. The use of a lognormal distribution to model biological thresholds is a common and appropriate mathematical technique. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions, assumptions, and data for a unique solution. The language is objective and the parameters provided are physiologically plausible.\n\nThe solution is approached in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Calculation of Barrier Impairment\n\nThe barrier impairment is defined as the fractional increase in TEWL relative to the baseline.\nLet $\\text{TEWL}_0$ be the baseline Transepidermal Water Loss and $\\text{TEWL}_1$ be the post-exposure TEWL.\nThe givens are:\n$$ \\text{TEWL}_0 = 8 \\text{ g}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-2}\\cdot\\text{h}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\text{TEWL}_1 = 24 \\text{ g}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-2}\\cdot\\text{h}^{-1} $$\nThe fractional increase, which we denote as $I$, is calculated as:\n$$ I = \\frac{\\text{TEWL}_1 - \\text{TEWL}_0}{\\text{TEWL}_0} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ I = \\frac{24 - 8}{8} = \\frac{16}{8} = 2 $$\nThe problem requires this value to be expressed as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ I = 2.00 $$\n\nPart 2: Calculation of Elicitation Probability\n\nThe goal is to calculate the probability that a randomly selected individual will elicit an eczematous reaction. This occurs if the individual's elicitation threshold flux, $T$, is less than or equal to the actual antigen flux, $J$, at the post-detergent state. We need to compute $P(T \\leq J)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the post-exposure antigen flux, $J$. The problem states that antigen flux scales linearly with TEWL:\n$$ \\frac{J}{J_0} = \\frac{\\text{TEWL}_1}{\\text{TEWL}_0} $$\nwhere $J_0$ is the baseline antigen flux.\nSubstituting the TEWL values:\n$$ J = J_0 \\frac{\\text{TEWL}_1}{\\text{TEWL}_0} = J_0 \\frac{24}{8} = 3 J_0 $$\nSo, the condition for elicitation is $T \\leq 3 J_0$.\n\nNext, we address the distribution of the threshold flux, $T$. It is given that $T$ follows a lognormal distribution with a median $J_{\\text{thr}} = 2 J_0$ and a logarithmic standard deviation $\\sigma = 0.5$.\nIf a random variable $T$ is lognormally distributed, then its natural logarithm, $X = \\ln(T)$, is normally distributed. Let this normal distribution be $X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, where $\\mu$ is the mean of $X$ and $\\sigma$ is its standard deviation.\n\nThe median of a lognormal distribution is given by $\\exp(\\mu)$. We are given that the median is $J_{\\text{thr}} = 2 J_0$.\n$$ \\exp(\\mu) = 2 J_0 $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives the mean of the underlying normal distribution:\n$$ \\mu = \\ln(2 J_0) = \\ln(2) + \\ln(J_0) $$\nThe logarithmic standard deviation is the standard deviation of $\\ln(T)$, which is given as $\\sigma = 0.5$.\n\nWe need to calculate the probability $P(T \\leq 3 J_0)$. We can transform this inequality by taking the natural logarithm of both sides, since the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function:\n$$ P(T \\leq 3 J_0) = P(\\ln(T) \\leq \\ln(3 J_0)) = P(X \\leq \\ln(3) + \\ln(J_0)) $$\nTo find this probability, we standardize the normal random variable $X$ to a standard normal variable $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$ using the transformation $Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}$.\n$$ P\\left(Z \\leq \\frac{(\\ln(3) + \\ln(J_0)) - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$:\n$$ P\\left(Z \\leq \\frac{(\\ln(3) + \\ln(J_0)) - (\\ln(2) + \\ln(J_0))}{0.5}\\right) $$\nThe $\\ln(J_0)$ terms cancel out:\n$$ P\\left(Z \\leq \\frac{\\ln(3) - \\ln(2)}{0.5}\\right) = P\\left(Z \\leq \\frac{\\ln(3/2)}{0.5}\\right) = P(Z \\leq 2 \\ln(1.5)) $$\nLet the argument of the probability function be $z_{val} = 2 \\ln(1.5)$. We can compute its numerical value:\n$$ z_{val} = 2 \\ln(1.5) \\approx 2 \\times 0.405465 = 0.81093 $$\nThe probability is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, denoted by $\\Phi(z_{val})$.\n$$ P = \\Phi(2 \\ln(1.5)) \\approx \\Phi(0.81093) $$\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a computational tool, we find the value of the CDF:\n$$ \\Phi(0.81093) \\approx 0.79128 $$\nThe problem requires rounding the probability to three significant figures.\n$$ P \\approx 0.791 $$\n\nThe two required values are the barrier impairment of $2.00$ and the elicitation probability of $0.791$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2.00  0.791\n\\end{pmatrix}\n} $$", "id": "4315501"}, {"introduction": "Understanding how medications work at a molecular level is crucial for effective treatment.

The diagnostic space consists of two mutually exclusive and exhaustive hypotheses: acute eczematous dermatitis, $E$, and bullous pemphigoid, $B$. The fact that they are mutually exclusive and exhaustive means that the event $\\neg E$ (the condition is not acute eczematous dermatitis) is logically equivalent to the event $B$ (the condition is bullous pemphigoid).
