{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding the inheritance of the Rhesus (Rh) system is more complex than a single-gene trait, as it involves multiple, closely linked antigens. This exercise challenges you to apply Mendelian principles to predict offspring phenotypes based on parental haplotypes, which are often inherited as a block. Mastering this type of genetic cross is essential for appreciating the diversity of Rh phenotypes and for genetic counseling regarding potential risks like Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus and Newborn (HDFN) [@problem_id:4313344].", "problem": "In the Rhesus (Rh) blood group system (Rh), the Fisher–Race nomenclature represents haplotypes as combinations of antigens $D/d$, $C/c$, and $E/e$. Consider two parents with Rh haplotypes as follows: Parent A is $R^{1}r$ and Parent B is $R^{2}r$, where $R^{1}$ denotes $DCe$, $R^{2}$ denotes $DcE$, and $r$ denotes $dce$.

I will begin by validating the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **System:** Rhesus (Rh) blood group system using Fisher-Race nomenclature. The ABO system is independent and ignored.\n- **Parental Genotypes:** Parent A is $R^{1}r$. Parent B is $R^{2}r$.\n- **Haplotype Definitions:** $R^{1} = DCe$, $R^{2} = DcE$, $r = dce$.\n- **Inheritance Rules:** standard Mendelian inheritance. Haplotypes are treated as single units with no recombination between the $D/d$, $C/c$, and $E/e$ loci.\n- **Phenotype Assumption:** Uppercase alleles ($D$, $C$, $E$) are dominant and their presence determines the phenotype. A $D$ negative phenotype corresponds to a $d/d$ genotype. The joint phenotypes $CE$, $Ce$, $cE$, $ce$ refer to the presence or absence of the C and E antigens.\n- **Required Calculation 1:** The probability that a child is $D$ negative.\n- **Required Calculation 2:** The expected proportions of the four joint phenotypes $CE$, $Ce$, $cE$, and $ce$ among the offspring.\n- **Answer Format:** A single row matrix with 5 entries: P($D$ negative), P($CE$), P($Ce$), P($cE$), P($ce$). All probabilities must be exact fractions.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is well-grounded in fundamental principles of human genetics. The Fisher-Race nomenclature, the specified haplotypes ($R^1, R^2, r$), and the principles of Mendelian inheritance are standard concepts in immunogenetics. The assumption of no recombination is a valid simplification for this problem, as the genes for C/c and E/e ($RHCE$) and the gene for D ($RHD$) are very closely linked on chromosome 1.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information. The parental genotypes are defined, the inheritance mechanism is specified, and the questions are unambiguous. A unique solution can be derived.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language without subjective or speculative elements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard Mendelian genetics problem that can be solved using a Punnett square analysis. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of probabilities for offspring phenotypes based on parental Rh genotypes. We begin by determining the gametes produced by each parent. The parental genotypes are given as $R^{1}r$ for Parent A and $R^{2}r$ for Parent B. The haplotypes are defined as $R^{1} = DCe$, $R^{2} = DcE$, and $r = dce$.\n\nThe genotype of Parent A is $R^{1}r$, which corresponds to the haplotype pair $(DCe)(dce)$.\nThe genotype of Parent B is $R^{2}r$, which corresponds to the haplotype pair $(DcE)(dce)$.\n\nAccording to Mendelian inheritance, each parent transmits one of their two haplotypes to an offspring with equal probability. The assumption of no recombination means the haplotypes ($DCe$, $dce$, $DcE$) are inherited as intact units.\n\nParent A produces two types of gametes:\n- Gamete with haplotype $R^{1}$ ($DCe$) with probability $p_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Gamete with haplotype $r$ ($dce$) with probability $p_2 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nParent B produces two types of gametes:\n- Gamete with haplotype $R^{2}$ ($DcE$) with probability $p_3 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Gamete with haplotype $r$ ($dce$) with probability $p_4 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWe can construct a Punnett square to determine the genotypes of the potential offspring and their probabilities. Each cell in the square represents a possible offspring genotype, and its probability is the product of the probabilities of the combining gametes, which is $(\\frac{1}{2}) \\times (\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}$ for each outcome.\n\nThe four possible offspring genotypes are:\n1.  From Parent A's $R^{1}$ ($DCe$) and Parent B's $R^{2}$ ($DcE$): Offspring genotype $(DCe)(DcE)$. Probability = $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n2.  From Parent A's $R^{1}$ ($DCe$) and Parent B's $r$ ($dce$): Offspring genotype $(DCe)(dce)$. Probability = $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n3.  From Parent A's $r$ ($dce$) and Parent B's $R^{2}$ ($DcE$): Offspring genotype $(dce)(DcE)$. Probability = $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n4.  From Parent A's $r$ ($dce$) and Parent B's $r$ ($dce$): Offspring genotype $(dce)(dce)$. Probability = $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n**Part 1: Probability of a $D$ negative child**\n\nA $D$ negative phenotype results from a $d/d$ genotype. We examine the $D/d$ locus for each of the four possible offspring genotypes:\n-   Genotype $(DCe)(DcE)$: The alleles for the $D$ locus are $D$ from the first haplotype and $D$ from the second. The genotype is $D/D$, which is $D$ positive.\n-   Genotype $(DCe)(dce)$: The alleles are $D$ and $d$. The genotype is $D/d$, which is $D$ positive (since $D$ is dominant).\n-   Genotype $(dce)(DcE)$: The alleles are $d$ and $D$. The genotype is $d/D$, which is $D$ positive.\n-   Genotype $(dce)(dce)$: The alleles are $d$ and $d$. The genotype is $d/d$, which is $D$ negative.\n\nOnly one of the four equally likely genotypes results in a $D$ negative phenotype. Therefore, the probability that a randomly conceived child is $D$ negative is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n**Part 2: Joint $C/c$ and $E/e$ phenotype distribution**\n\nWe must determine the phenotype for the $C/c$ and $E/e$ loci for each offspring. The phenotype is determined by the presence of the dominant antigen ($C$ or $E$).\n-   Phenotype $CE$: Presence of both C and E antigens. Genotype must have at least one $C$ allele and at least one $E$ allele.\n-   Phenotype $Ce$: Presence of C antigen, absence of E antigen. Genotype must have at least one $C$ allele and be $e/e$.\n-   Phenotype $cE$: Absence of C antigen, presence of E antigen. Genotype must be $c/c$ and have at least one $E$ allele.\n-   Phenotype $ce$: Absence of both C and E antigens. Genotype must be $c/c$ and $e/e$.\n\nLet's analyze the four offspring genotypes:\n1.  **Genotype $(DCe)(DcE)$** (Probability $\\frac{1}{4}$):\n    -   $C/c$ locus: Alleles are $C$ and $c$. Genotype is $C/c$. C antigen is present.\n    -   $E/e$ locus: Alleles are $e$ and $E$. Genotype is $e/E$. E antigen is present.\n    -   The resulting phenotype is **$CE$**.\n\n2.  **Genotype $(DCe)(dce)$** (Probability $\\frac{1}{4}$):\n    -   $C/c$ locus: Alleles are $C$ and $c$. Genotype is $C/c$. C antigen is present.\n    -   $E/e$ locus: Alleles are $e$ and $e$. Genotype is $e/e$. E antigen is absent.\n    -   The resulting phenotype is **$Ce$**.\n\n3.  **Genotype $(dce)(DcE)$** (Probability $\\frac{1}{4}$):\n    -   $C/c$ locus: Alleles are $c$ and $c$. Genotype is $c/c$. C antigen is absent.\n    -   $E/e$ locus: Alleles are $e$ and $E$. Genotype is $e/E$. E antigen is present.\n    -   The resulting phenotype is **$cE$**.\n\n4.  **Genotype $(dce)(dce)$** (Probability $\\frac{1}{4}$):\n    -   $C/c$ locus: Alleles are $c$ and $c$. Genotype is $c/c$. C antigen is absent.\n    -   $E/e$ locus: Alleles are $e$ and $e$. Genotype is $e/e$. E antigen is absent.\n    -   The resulting phenotype is **$ce$**.\n\nEach of the four offspring genotypes occurs with a probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$, and each genotype corresponds to one unique phenotype group. Thus, the expected distribution for the joint phenotypes is:\n-   Proportion of $CE$: $\\frac{1}{4}$\n-   Proportion of $Ce$: $\\frac{1}{4}$\n-   Proportion of $cE$: $\\frac{1}{4}$\n-   Proportion of $ce$: $\\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThe final answer requires a row matrix with the probability of being $D$ negative, followed by the proportions for $CE$, $Ce$, $cE$, and $ce$. All values are $\\frac{1}{4}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{1}{4} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4313344"}, {"introduction": "While understanding inheritance within a family is crucial, immunohematology also involves a population-level perspective for applications like public health and blood bank management.
