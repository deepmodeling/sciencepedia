The complement system has three initiation routes—the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway—that converge at cleavage of complement component C3 and proceed through a shared terminal (lytic) pathway that assembles the membrane attack complex. Activation of the classical pathway requires antigen–antibody complexes and a calcium-dependent C1 complex, whereas the alternative pathway proceeds by spontaneous C3 hydrolysis and amplification on activating surfaces and requires magnesium ions for assembly of the C3 convertase. The lectin pathway resembles the classical pathway in being calcium-dependent but is triggered by pattern recognition via mannose-binding lectin.\n\nBy definition, the classical pathway hemolytic assay (CH50) is the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that causes $50\\%$ lysis of antibody-sensitized sheep red blood cells (RBCs) under conditions that permit classical pathway activation.

The use of Mg-EGTA to differentially chelate $Ca^{2+}$ is a valid and commonly used laboratory technique to isolate the alternative pathway.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe solution requires a systematic analysis of the provided laboratory results based on the known architecture of the complement system.\n\n1.  **Analyze the $AH50$ Result**: The patient's serum has a normal $AH50$ titer. The $AH50$ assay measures the functional integrity of the alternative pathway and the common terminal pathway. The alternative pathway requires Factor B, Factor D, and Properdin to form its $C3$ convertase. The terminal pathway, which is common to all activation routes, consists of components $C5, C6, C7, C8$, and $C9$, which assemble to form the lytic membrane attack complex (MAC). Since the $AH50$ assay results in normal hemolysis, it confirms that all components of the alternative pathway (Factor B, Factor D, Properdin) and all components of the terminal pathway ($C5$ through $C9$) are present and functional. The problem also states that $C3$ concentration is normal, which is consistent with a normal $AH50$ as $C3$ is central to this pathway.\n\n2.  **Analyze the $CH50$ Result**: The patient's serum has an undetectable $CH50$. The $CH50$ assay measures the functional integrity of the classical pathway and the common terminal pathway. The classical pathway requires the $C1$ complex ($C1q, C1r, C1s$), $C4$, and $C2$. Activation of this pathway leads to the formation of the classical pathway $C3$ convertase ($C4b2a$), which then activates $C3$ and initiates the terminal pathway.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Findings**:\n    - Functional status:\n        - Alternative Pathway (Factor D, Factor B, Properdin): **Functional** (from normal $AH50$)\n        - Terminal Pathway ($C5, C6, C7, C8, C9$): **Functional** (from normal $AH50$)\n        - Component $C3$: **Functional** (from normal $AH50$ and normal concentration)\n        - Classical Pathway ($C1, C4, C2$): **Non-functional** (from undetectable $CH50$)\n\n    The combination of a non-functional classical pathway and a functional alternative/terminal pathway indicates a defect in a component that is unique to the classical pathway. The components unique to the classical pathway are $C1$, $C4$, and $C2$. A deficiency in any of these components would abrogate the $CH50$ assay while leaving the $AH50$ assay unaffected.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Complement component C2 deficiency**\n- $C2$ is a protein of the classical pathway. It combines with $C4b$ to form the classical pathway $C3$ convertase, $C4b2a$.\n- A deficiency in $C2$ would block the classical pathway, leading to an undetectable $CH50$.\n- $C2$ is not involved in the alternative or terminal pathways. Therefore, a $C2$ deficiency would not affect the $AH50$ assay.\n- This pattern perfectly matches the patient's laboratory results (undetectable $CH50$, normal $AH50$).\n- **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Complement factor D deficiency**\n- Factor D is a serine protease essential for the alternative pathway. It is required to cleave Factor B into $Bb$, forming the alternative pathway $C3$ convertase, $C3bBb$.\n- A deficiency in Factor D would impair the alternative pathway, leading to a low or undetectable $AH50$. The classical pathway would remain functional, resulting in a normal $CH50$.\n- This is the opposite of the patient's results.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Complement component C6 deficiency**\n- $C6$ is a component of the terminal pathway, required for the assembly of the membrane attack complex ($C5b-9$).\n- The MAC is the final effector of complement-mediated lysis and is required for both the $CH50$ and $AH50$ assays.\n- A deficiency in $C6$ would result in an undetectable value for both $CH50$ and $AH50$.\n- This contradicts the patient's normal $AH50$ result.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Properdin deficiency**\n- Properdin (Factor P) is a positive regulator that stabilizes the alternative pathway $C3$ convertase ($C3bBb$), greatly amplifying alternative pathway activation.\n- A deficiency in properdin severely impairs the alternative pathway, leading to a low or undetectable $AH50$. The classical pathway is not affected.\n- This pattern (normal $CH50$, low $AH50$) is the opposite of the patient's results.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the analysis, a deficiency in complement component $C2$ is the only explanation that accounts for the observed selective failure of the classical pathway ($CH50=0$) with intact function of the alternative and terminal pathways ($AH50$=normal).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4349140"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple deficiencies, many complement-mediated diseases are driven by dysregulation and uncontrolled pathway activation.

The solution will be derived by methodically interpreting the provided laboratory data in the context of the three pathways of complement activation: the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways.\n\n### Step 1: Validation of the Problem Statement\n\n**Givens:**\nThe following data are provided for a patient with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury:\n1.  Serum complement component 3 ($C3$) is reduced.\n2.  Serum complement component 4 ($C4$) is within the reference interval.\n3.  The classical pathway hemolytic complement assay (CH50) is reduced.\n4.  The alternative pathway hemolytic assay (AH50) is reduced.\n5.  Mannose-Binding Lectin (MBL) concentration is normal.\n6.  No protein-losing state is present.\n7.  Liver synthetic function is normal.\n\nThe question asks for the single-component defect that best explains these findings via the alternative pathway amplification loop.\n\n**Validation:**\n1.  **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in the established principles of immunology and clinical pathology. The complement system, its components ($C3$, $C4$, etc.), pathways, regulatory proteins (Factor H, Properdin), and screening assays (CH50, AH50) are fundamental concepts. The clinical presentation is a classic syndrome (atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome, aHUS) known to be associated with complement dysregulation.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a set of specific, consistent laboratory findings and asks for the most parsimonious explanation from a given list of options. The ancillary data (normal liver function, no protein-losing state) are crucial as they rule out alternative causes for low complement proteins, such as decreased synthesis or increased non-specific loss. This makes the problem well-posed and solvable by logical deduction.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The data are objective laboratory measurements, and the question asks for the \"best explanation,\" which in this context is a matter of scientific consistency, not subjective opinion.\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and well-posed. No flaws are identified. The premises are realistic and describe a classic clinical scenario. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe core of the analysis lies in understanding how each complement pathway affects the levels of key components and the results of functional assays.\n\n1.  **Interpreting $C3$ and $C4$ levels:**\n    *   The classical pathway is initiated by C1 complex binding to antigen-antibody complexes. Its activation consumes both $C4$ and $C2$, leading to the formation of the classical pathway $C3$ convertase (C$4b2a$), which then cleaves $C3$.\n    *   The lectin pathway is initiated by Mannose-Binding Lectin (MBL) or ficolins binding to carbohydrates on pathogen surfaces. It also proceeds through $C4$ and $C2$ cleavage, forming the same $C3$ convertase (C$4b2a$) and consuming $C3$.\n    *   The alternative pathway (AP) is initiated by the spontaneous hydrolysis of $C3$ and deposition of $C3b$. It bypasses C1, $C4$, and $C2$. Its $C3$ convertase is C$3bBb$.\n    *   The patient's **normal $C4$ level** is a critical finding. It indicates that there is no significant activation of the classical or lectin pathways, as activation of either would consume $C4$. This is further supported by the **normal MBL concentration**.\n    *   The patient's **reduced $C3$ level** in the presence of a normal $C4$ level points unequivocally to the consumption of $C3$ via the alternative pathway.\n\n2.  **Interpreting the Functional Assays (CH50 and AH50):**\n    *   The **AH50 assay** measures the functional integrity of the alternative pathway. A reduced AH50 can result from two general mechanisms: (i) a deficiency of one of the AP components required for lysis (e.g., Factor B, Factor D, Properdin, or terminal components C$5$-C$9$), or (ii) the severe consumption and depletion of a key component (like $C3$) due to over-activation, leaving insufficient amounts for the *in vitro* assay to proceed.\n    *   The **CH50 assay** measures the functional integrity of the entire classical pathway, from C1 through C9. A reduced CH50 typically signifies a deficiency in a classical pathway component. However, all pathways converge at $C3$ and share the common terminal pathway (C$5$-C$9$). Therefore, a profound secondary depletion of $C3$ (or any terminal component) due to massive AP over-activation will also result in a reduced CH50, as the assay cannot proceed without sufficient $C3$.\n\n3.  **Synthesizing the Findings:**\n    The pattern is: normal $C4$, low $C3$, low AH50, and low CH50. This combination indicates isolated, uncontrolled activation of the alternative pathway. The over-activation is so pronounced that it depletes the systemic pool of $C3$. This $C3$ depletion, in turn, causes both the AH50 and CH50 assays to be low due to substrate unavailability. The question directs us to consider a defect in the \"alternative pathway amplification loop.\" This loop's activity is determined by the balance between activators/stabilizers (like Properdin) and inhibitors/destabilizers (like Factor H). Uncontrolled activation is caused by a failure of inhibition.\n\n### Step 3: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Mannose-Binding Lectin (MBL) deficiency**\nAn MBL deficiency impairs the lectin pathway. This would not cause consumption of $C3$ or $C4$ and would not lead to the observed laboratory abnormalities. Furthermore, the problem statement explicitly states that the MBL concentration is normal.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. $C1q$ deficiency**\nA $C1q$ deficiency cripples the classical pathway. This would lead to a very low or absent CH50. However, the AH50 and $C3$/$C4$ levels would be normal. This profile is inconsistent with the patient's data, particularly the normal $C4$ and low $C3$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Factor H deficiency**\nFactor H is the principal soluble negative regulator of the alternative pathway. It acts by accelerating the decay of the AP $C3$ convertase ($C3bBb$) and by serving as a cofactor for Factor I-mediated cleavage and inactivation of $C3b$. A deficiency in Factor H removes this \"brake\" on the AP amplification loop, leading to spontaneous, uncontrolled, and massive activation of the alternative pathway. This results in:\n*   Continuous consumption and severe depletion of $C3$ (matching the **reduced $C3$**).\n*   No activation of the classical/lectin pathway (matching the **normal $C4$**).\n*   Depletion of $C3$ and other AP components, leading to a failure of the *in vitro* assay (matching the **reduced AH50**).\n*   Depletion of $C3$, which is also required for the classical pathway assay (matching the **reduced CH50**).\nThis defect perfectly explains the entire pattern of results and the clinical presentation of aHUS.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Properdin (Factor P) deficiency**\nProperdin is a positive regulator that stabilizes the AP $C3$ convertase. Its deficiency leads to an *impaired*, not overactive, alternative pathway. This would cause a low AH50 but $C3$ and $C4$ levels would be normal, and the CH50 would also be normal. This is inconsistent with the patient's low $C3$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. $C9$ deficiency**\n$C9$ is a terminal component required to form the final lytic pore of the membrane attack complex. Its deficiency would impair cell lysis, leading to low CH50 and low AH50 values. However, all upstream activation and consumption would be unaffected. Therefore, $C3$ and $C4$ levels would be normal. This contradicts the patient's low $C3$ level.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4349125"}, {"introduction": "This final practice bridges foundational science with modern therapeutics, demonstrating the clinical power of a quantitative understanding of complement.
