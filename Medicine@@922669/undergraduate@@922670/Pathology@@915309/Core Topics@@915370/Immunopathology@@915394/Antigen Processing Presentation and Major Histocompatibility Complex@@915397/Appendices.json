Three distinct 9-mer peptides, labeled peptide $P_1$, peptide $P_2$, and peptide $P_3$, compete for binding to the same peptide-binding groove on HLA-B*08:01. The binding interaction for each peptide is assumed to follow reversible bimolecular mass-action kinetics $R + L_i \\rightleftharpoons RL_i$, where $R$ is the free HLA-B*08:01, $L_i$ is peptide $P_i$, and $RL_i$ is the peptide–MHC complex.

The system is at steady state, and the interactions are governed by reversible bimolecular mass-action kinetics.\n\nThe binding reaction for each peptide $L_i$ (where $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$) with the receptor $R$ (HLA-B*08:01) is given by:\n$$R + L_i \\rightleftharpoons RL_i$$\n\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_{d,i}$, is defined for each reaction as the ratio of the product of the concentrations of the reactants to the concentration of the product at equilibrium:\n$$K_{d,i} = \\frac{[R][L_i]}{[RL_i]}$$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of free HLA-B*08:01, $[L_i]$ is the concentration of free peptide $P_i$, and $[RL_i]$ is the concentration of the peptide–MHC complex.\n\nWe can rearrange this definition to express the concentration of each complex, $[RL_i]$, as a function of the free receptor concentration, free peptide concentration, and the dissociation constant:\n$$[RL_i] = \\frac{[R][L_i]}{K_{d,i}}$$\n\nThe problem states two crucial assumptions. First, the steady-state free concentrations of the three peptides are equal. Let us denote this common concentration by $C$:\n$$[L_1] = [L_2] = [L_3] = C$$\nThe second assumption is that the peptide concentrations are large compared to the total HLA-B*08:01 concentration, which justifies treating $C$ as a constant that is not depleted by binding.\n\nSubstituting the common peptide concentration $C$ into the expressions for the complex concentrations, we get:\n$$[RL_1] = \\frac{[R]C}{K_{d,1}}$$\n$$[RL_2] = \\frac{[R]C}{K_{d,2}}$$\n$$[RL_3] = \\frac{[R]C}{K_{d,3}}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the relative fractional occupancy of each peptide, conditioned on the molecule being occupied by one of these three peptides. This means we are interested in the fraction of a specific complex, $[RL_i]$, relative to the total concentration of all three complexes. The total concentration of occupied HLA-B*08:01 molecules is the sum of the concentrations of the individual complexes:\n$$[RL]_{\\text{total}} = [RL_1] + [RL_2] + [RL_3]$$\n\nThe fractional occupancy for peptide $P_i$, denoted as $f_i$, is therefore:\n$$f_i = \\frac{[RL_i]}{[RL]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[RL_i]}{[RL_1] + [RL_2] + [RL_3]}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions derived earlier for each $[RL_i]$:\n$$f_i = \\frac{\\frac{[R]C}{K_{d,i}}}{\\frac{[R]C}{K_{d,1}} + \\frac{[R]C}{K_{d,2}} + \\frac{[R]C}{K_{d,3}}}$$\n\nThe term $[R]C$ is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator, and thus it cancels out. This demonstrates that the relative occupancies depend only on the respective dissociation constants, not on the exact concentrations of the receptor or the peptides (as long as the peptide concentrations are equal).\n$$f_i = \\frac{\\frac{1}{K_{d,i}}}{\\frac{1}{K_{d,1}} + \\frac{1}{K_{d,2}} + \\frac{1}{K_{d,3}}}$$\n\nThe peptide that \"dominates presentation\" is the one with the highest fractional occupancy. From the formula for $f_i$, it is evident that the fractional occupancy is inversely proportional to the dissociation constant, $K_{d,i}$. A lower $K_d$ signifies a higher binding affinity and, under these competitive conditions, a higher occupancy.\n\nThe given dissociation constants are:\n$K_{d,1} = 3 \\ \\mathrm{nM}$\n$K_{d,2} = 30 \\ \\mathrm{nM}$\n$K_{d,3} = 300 \\ \\mathrm{nM}$\n\nSince $K_{d,1}  K_{d,2}  K_{d,3}$, peptide $P_1$ has the highest binding affinity and will be the dominant peptide.

Through a hands-on coding exercise, you will derive and implement a general model for competitive binding that allows you to simulate how changes in the supply of one peptide can dramatically alter the presentation of others, providing a dynamic view of how the peptide repertoire on the cell surface is shaped [@problem_id:4327328].", "problem": "A limited pool of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules must load short antigenic peptides generated by antigen processing. Multiple peptide species compete for the same finite set of binding sites on MHC, and the outcome of this competition determines which peptide epitopes will be predominantly presented, a phenomenon known as immunodominance. From first principles, model this competition at steady state using reversible binding governed by the law of mass action and conservation of binding sites.\n\nAssume the following fundamental base:\n- Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules bind peptides via reversible interactions.\n- For each peptide species $i$ with abundance $C_i$ (dimensionless, relative abundance units) and dissociation constant $K_{d,i}$ (dimensionless, normalized to the same units as $C_i$), the reversible reaction is $M + P_i \\leftrightharpoons MP_i$.\n- The law of mass action applies and site conservation holds. At steady state, the system is time-invariant, and all species satisfy binding equilibria with a single pool of free MHC molecules.\n\nTasks:\n1. Starting from the law of mass action and conservation of binding sites, derive the equilibrium fraction of MHC molecules loaded by peptide $i$ in the presence of $n$ competing peptide species, expressed purely in terms of the set $\\{C_i\\}$ and $\\{K_{d,i}\\}$, and the single shared pool of free MHC binding sites.

Implement a program that, for each test case provided below, computes the per-peptide fractions of loaded MHC. Each fraction is dimensionless and must be returned in the same peptide order as specified in the test case. No physical units are required because the outputs are fractional occupancies (dimensionless).\n3. The program must output a single line containing all test case results aggregated into one comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. Each test case result itself must be a list of floats, formatted to exactly six decimal places, also enclosed in square brackets and comma-separated, in the same order as the input peptides.

It describes a classic competitive ligand-receptor binding scenario, a fundamental concept in biochemistry and immunology, specifically applied to peptide presentation by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules. The provided parameters and objectives are clear and sufficient for a unique solution. The problem is valid.\n\nThe derivation of the equilibrium fraction of MHC molecules loaded by a specific peptide species $i$ is derived from first principles: the law of mass action and the conservation of mass for the MHC molecules.\n\nLet there be $n$ distinct peptide species, indexed by $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. The reversible binding reaction between a free MHC molecule, $M$, and a peptide molecule of species $i$, $P_i$, to form a peptide-MHC complex, $MP_i$, is given by:\n$$M + P_i \\leftrightharpoons MP_i$$\n\nAt steady state, the system is at equilibrium. The law of mass action defines the dissociation constant, $K_{d,i}$, for each peptide species $i$ as the ratio of the product of the concentrations of the reactants to the concentration of the product:\n$$K_{d,i} = \\frac{[M] [P_i]}{[MP_i]}$$\nwhere $[M]$ is the molar concentration of free MHC molecules, $[P_i]$ is the molar concentration of free peptide $i$, and $[MP_i]$ is the molar concentration of the MHC-peptide $i$ complex.\n\nThe problem states the abundance of each peptide species $i$ is given by a dimensionless relative quantity $C_i$. In the context of antigen presentation, the total amount of peptides is typically in vast excess of the total number of MHC molecules. Therefore, the concentration of free peptide, $[P_i]$, can be accurately approximated by its total abundance, $C_i$. With this standard assumption, we have:\n$$K_{d,i} \\approx \\frac{[M] C_i}{[MP_i]}$$\n\nWe can rearrange this expression to solve for the concentration of each specific peptide-MHC complex, $[MP_i]$, in terms of the concentration of free MHC, $[M]$:\n$$[MP_i] = \\frac{[M] C_i}{K_{d,i}}$$\nThis equation shows that the concentration of any given MHC-peptide complex is directly proportional to the concentration of free MHC molecules and to the peptide's binding propensity, which is the ratio of its abundance to its dissociation constant, $C_i/K_{d,i}$.\n\nThe second fundamental principle is the conservation of MHC molecules. The total concentration of MHC molecules, denoted as $[M]_{\\text{total}}$, must be equal to the sum of the concentration of free MHC molecules and the concentrations of all bound forms. With $n$ competing peptide species, this is expressed as:\n$$[M]_{\\text{total}} = [M] + \\sum_{j=1}^{n} [MP_j]$$\nThe summation is over all peptide species $j$ from $1$ to $n$.\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $[MP_j]$ from the law of mass action into the conservation equation:\n$$[M]_{\\text{total}} = [M] + \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{[M] C_j}{K_{d,j}}$$\n\nWe can factor out the common term $[M]$ from the right-hand side of the equation:\n$$[M]_{\\text{total}} = [M] \\left(1 + \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{C_j}{K_{d,j}}\\right)$$\n\nThe problem asks for the equilibrium fraction of MHC molecules loaded by a specific peptide $i$. Let us denote this fraction as $f_i$. This fraction is defined as the concentration of MHC bound to peptide $i$ divided by the total concentration of MHC molecules:\n$$f_i = \\frac{[MP_i]}{[M]_{\\text{total}}}$$\n\nWe can now substitute the expressions we derived for the numerator, $[MP_i]$, and the denominator, $[M]_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$f_i = \\frac{\\frac{[M] C_i}{K_{d,i}}}{[M] \\left(1 + \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{C_j}{K_{d,j}}\\right)}$$\n\nThe unknown concentration of free MHC molecules, $[M]$, appears in both the numerator and the denominator, and thus cancels out. This is a critical result, as it shows that the fractional occupancy is independent of the total MHC concentration and depends only on the known abundances, $\\{C_j\\}$, and dissociation constants, $\\{K_{d,j}\\}$, of the competing peptides.\n\nThe final expression for the fractional occupancy of MHC by peptide $i$ is:\n$$f_i = \\frac{\\frac{C_i}{K_{d,i}}}{1 + \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{C_j}{K_{d,j}}}$$\n\nThis equation quantitatively describes immunodominance. The numerator, $C_i/K_{d,i}$, represents the binding propensity of peptide $i$. The denominator, $1 + \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (C_j/K_{d,j})$, is a normalization factor that accounts for the free MHC population (the '$1$' term) and the competition from all peptides, including peptide $i$ itself. A peptide can achieve a high fractional occupancy (i.e., become immunodominant) by having a high abundance ($C_i$), a high affinity (low $K_{d,i}$), or a combination of both, relative to its competitors.

This exercise shifts our focus to the MHC class II pathway and challenges you to predict the consequences of a common pathogenic strategy: altering the pH of the endosome. By integrating your knowledge of the pH-dependent activity of processing enzymes (cathepsins) and peptide-editing molecules (HLA-DM), you will reason through how a single environmental change can cause a cascade of failures in the antigen presentation machinery, ultimately crippling an adaptive immune response [@problem_id:4327411].", "problem": "A researcher investigates how a pathogen that secretes weak bases alters antigen presentation on Major Histocompatibility Complex class II (MHC II). Under physiological conditions, late endosomes and lysosomes in antigen-presenting cells maintain an acidic environment with $pH \\approx 4.5$ to $pH \\approx 5.5$ via the vacuolar-type adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase). In this compartment, exogenous proteins are processed by endosomal/lysosomal proteases (for example, cathepsins) into peptides, which are loaded onto MHC II molecules after Class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP) removal catalyzed by Human Leukocyte Antigen-DM (HLA-DM). The pathogen raises the endosomal $pH$ to $pH \\approx 6.5$–$pH \\approx 7.0$.\n\nThe following well-established, qualitative dependencies are considered as the fundamental base of your reasoning:\n- Acid-dependent cathepsins such as cathepsin $L$ and cathepsin $B$ show sharply reduced activity as $pH$ increases above mildly acidic values; cathepsin $S$ is more tolerant of increased $pH$ and retains appreciable activity closer to neutral.\n- HLA-DM facilitates CLIP release and peptide exchange most efficiently at mildly acidic $pH$; its catalytic efficiency declines as $pH$ approaches neutrality.\n\nLet $A_i(pH)$ denote the qualitative activity curve of cathepsin $i$ as a function of $pH$, and let $E_{\\mathrm{DM}}(pH)$ denote the qualitative catalytic efficiency profile of HLA-DM.

We must analyze the pH dependency of the two key processes: antigen proteolysis and peptide loading.\n\n1.  **Impact on Antigen Proteolysis:** The generation of peptides from exogenous antigens occurs in acidic endosomes and is mediated by proteases like cathepsins. The problem states that cathepsins L and B have sharply reduced activity as pH increases, while cathepsin S is more tolerant but still most active at acidic pH. Raising the pH to near-neutral levels will therefore severely impair the overall proteolytic capacity of the compartment. This leads to two main consequences:\n    *   **Reduced Peptide Generation:** Fewer antigenic peptides will be generated from the protein substrate.\n    *   **Altered Cleavage Patterns:** The resulting peptide pool will be less diverse and biased towards peptides generated by the remaining active proteases, primarily cathepsin S. Reduced activity of trimming exopeptidases would also likely result in peptides with longer, untrimmed termini.\n\n2.  **Impact on Peptide Loading and Editing:** The exchange of the placeholder peptide CLIP for an antigenic peptide is catalyzed by HLA-DM. The problem states that HLA-DM's catalytic efficiency is maximal at mildly acidic pH and declines as pH approaches neutrality. Therefore, endosomal alkalinization will impair HLA-DM function. This leads to:\n    *   **Increased CLIP Retention:** With less efficient HLA-DM catalysis, the release of CLIP from the MHC II binding groove is inhibited. Consequently, a higher proportion of MHC class II molecules will fail to load an antigenic peptide and will be transported to the cell surface still bound to CLIP.\n    *   **Impaired Peptide Editing:** For the MHC II molecules that do release CLIP, the peptide editing function of HLA-DM is also compromised. This means there is less effective \"sampling\" of the available peptide pool to select for high-affinity binders.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCombining these effects, the net result of endosomal alkalinization is a multifaceted failure of the MHC class II presentation pathway.\n*   The **diversity of the presented peptide repertoire decreases** due to both inefficient peptide generation and impaired peptide selection.\n*   The characteristics of the presented peptides are altered, with a likely **shift toward peptides generated by cathepsin S** and potentially **longer termini** due to incomplete trimming.\n*   A significant fraction of MHC II molecules will have **increased CLIP retention**, making them unable to present any foreign antigen at all.\n\nThis detailed analysis directly supports option A.
