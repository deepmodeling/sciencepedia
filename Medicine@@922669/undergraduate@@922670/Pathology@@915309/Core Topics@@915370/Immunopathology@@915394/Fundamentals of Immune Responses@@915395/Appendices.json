The process described—sequential positive and negative selection—is a fundamental concept in immunology. The given probabilities, $p_{+}$ and $p_{-}$, are well-defined, and the task is to calculate a resultant probability, making the problem self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. All required data are provided, and there are no contradictions. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be formulated.\n\nLet us define the events for a randomly chosen thymocyte:\n- Let $S_{+}$ be the event that the thymocyte survives positive selection.\n- Let $S_{N}$ be the event that the thymocyte survives negative selection.\n\nThe problem asks for the overall survival probability, which is the probability that a thymocyte survives both positive selection and the subsequent negative selection. This corresponds to the joint probability of events $S_{+}$ and $S_{N}$ occurring, which is denoted as $P(S_{+} \\cap S_{N})$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the probability that a thymocyte is positively selected is given as $p_{+}$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$P(S_{+}) = p_{+}$$\n\nNext, the problem states that $p_{-}$ is the probability that a *positively selected* thymocyte is *eliminated* by negative selection. This is a conditional probability. Let $E_{N}$ be the event of elimination by negative selection. Then, the probability of elimination by negative selection, given that the thymocyte has survived positive selection, is:\n$$P(E_{N} | S_{+}) = p_{-}$$\n\nThe event of surviving negative selection, $S_{N}$, is the complement of the event of being eliminated by negative selection, $E_{N}$. Thus, the probability of surviving negative selection, conditional on having survived positive selection, is:\n$$P(S_{N} | S_{+}) = 1 - P(E_{N} | S_{+})$$\nSubstituting the given variable, we get:\n$$P(S_{N} | S_{+}) = 1 - p_{-}$$\n\nThe selection events occur in sequence. A thymocyte must first pass positive selection and then pass negative selection. The overall survival probability, $P_{survival}$, is the probability of the intersection of these two events, $P(S_{+} \\cap S_{N})$. Using the definition of conditional probability, we can express this joint probability as:\n$$P_{survival} = P(S_{+} \\cap S_{N}) = P(S_{N} | S_{+}) \\times P(S_{+})$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the probabilities on the right-hand side, we derive the general expression for the overall survival probability:\n$$P_{survival} = p_{+} \\times (1 - p_{-})$$\n\nNow, we can compute the numerical value using the given data: $p_{+} = 0.05$ and $p_{-} = 0.60$.\n$$P_{survival} = 0.05 \\times (1 - 0.60)$$\n$$P_{survival} = 0.05 \\times 0.40$$\n$$P_{survival} = 0.02$$\n\nThis calculated probability, $0.02$, represents the fraction of the starting thymocyte cohort that successfully completes both selection processes and exits the thymus as mature T cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.02}$$", "id": "4372189"}, {"introduction": "A key outcome of thymic selection is central tolerance—the elimination of T-cells that could attack the body's own tissues.

You will quantify how a defect in this mechanism increases the escape of potentially dangerous autoreactive T-cells, linking a molecular failure to a systems-level outcome and the risk of autoimmunity [@problem_id:4372127].", "problem": "A central principle of adaptive immunity is that central tolerance in the thymus reduces the frequency of autoreactive T cell clones through negative selection.
