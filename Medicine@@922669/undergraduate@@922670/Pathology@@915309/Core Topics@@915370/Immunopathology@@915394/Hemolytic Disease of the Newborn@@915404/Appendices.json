Assume the RhD locus is biallelic with a dominant allele $D$ conferring RhD-positive phenotype and a recessive allele $d$ conferring RhD-negative phenotype. The mother is confirmed to be RhD-negative with genotype $dd$. The father is RhD-positive by serology, but his zygosity (whether $DD$ or $Dd$) is unknown. Both parents are drawn from a large, randomly mating population in Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). Let $p$ denote the frequency of the $D$ allele and $q$ denote the frequency of the $d$ allele in the population, with $p + q = 1$.

The population is assumed to be in Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). We are given the population frequency of the RhD-negative phenotype.\n\nLet $D$ be the dominant allele for the RhD-positive phenotype and $d$ be the recessive allele for the RhD-negative phenotype. The mother is RhD-negative, so her genotype is definitively $dd$. The father is RhD-positive, so his genotype is either $DD$ or $Dd$.\n\nFirst, we determine the frequencies of the alleles $D$ and $d$ in the population. Let $p$ be the frequency of allele $D$ and $q$ be the frequency of allele $d$. According to HWE, the frequency of the RhD-negative genotype, $dd$, is $q^2$.\nWe are given that the population frequency of the RhD-negative phenotype is $0.16$.\n$$q^{2} = 0.16$$\nSince $q$ represents an allele frequency, it must be a non-negative value. Therefore, we can find $q$ by taking the square root:\n$$q = \\sqrt{0.16} = 0.4$$\nThe sum of the allele frequencies must be $1$:\n$$p + q = 1$$\nSolving for $p$, we get:\n$$p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6$$\nSo, the frequency of the dominant allele $D$ is $p=0.6$ and the frequency of the recessive allele $d$ is $q=0.4$.\n\nNext, we must determine the probability of the father having genotype $DD$ or $Dd$, given that he is RhD-positive. The RhD-positive phenotype corresponds to genotypes $DD$ and $Dd$. The population frequencies of these genotypes are $p^2$ for $DD$ and $2pq$ for $Dd$.\nThe probability of an individual from this population being RhD-positive is the sum of the frequencies of the genotypes that confer this phenotype:\n$$P(\\text{RhD+}) = P(DD) + P(Dd) = p^{2} + 2pq$$\nSubstituting the calculated allele frequencies:\n$$P(\\text{RhD+}) = (0.6)^{2} + 2(0.6)(0.4) = 0.36 + 0.48 = 0.84$$\nAlternatively, $P(\\text{RhD+}) = 1 - P(\\text{RhD-}) = 1 - q^2 = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84$.\n\nNow, we can find the conditional probabilities of the father's genotype using the definition of conditional probability, $P(A|B) = P(A \\cap B) / P(B)$:\nThe probability that the father's genotype is $DD$, given he is RhD-positive, is:\n$$P(\\text{father is } DD \\mid \\text{father is RhD+}) = \\frac{P(DD)}{P(\\text{RhD+})} = \\frac{p^{2}}{p^{2} + 2pq} = \\frac{0.36}{0.84}$$\nThe probability that the father's genotype is $Dd$, given he is RhD-positive, is:\n$$P(\\text{father is } Dd \\mid \\text{father is RhD+}) = \\frac{P(Dd)}{P(\\text{RhD+})} = \\frac{2pq}{p^{2} + 2pq} = \\frac{0.48}{0.84}$$\n\nThe fetus will be RhD-positive if it inherits a $D$ allele from the father, since the mother has genotype $dd$ and can only pass on a $d$ allele. The resulting genotype of an RhD-positive fetus would be $Dd$. Therefore, the probability of the fetus being RhD-positive is equal to the probability that the father passes on a $D$ allele.\n\nWe can calculate this probability using the law of total probability, conditioned on the father's possible genotypes:\n$P(\\text{Fetus is RhD+}) = P(\\text{father passes } D \\mid \\text{father is RhD+})$\nThis probability is the sum of two scenarios:\n1. The father is $DD$ and passes on a $D$ allele.\n2. The father is $Dd$ and passes on a $D$ allele.\n\n$P(\\text{fetus is RhD+}) = P(\\text{father passes } D \\mid \\text{father is } DD) \\times P(\\text{father is } DD \\mid \\text{father is RhD+}) + P(\\text{father passes } D \\mid \\text{father is } Dd) \\times P(\\text{father is } Dd \\mid \\text{father is RhD+})$\n\nAccording to Mendelian inheritance:\n- A father with genotype $DD$ will always pass on a $D$ allele, so $P(\\text{father passes } D \\mid \\text{father is } DD) = 1$.\n- A father with genotype $Dd$ will pass on a $D$ allele with a probability of $1/2$, so $P(\\text{father passes } D \\mid \\text{father is } Dd) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$P(\\text{Fetus is RhD+}) = (1) \\times \\left(\\frac{p^{2}}{p^{2} + 2pq}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{2pq}{p^{2} + 2pq}\\right)$$\n$$P(\\text{Fetus is RhD+}) = \\frac{p^{2} + pq}{p^{2} + 2pq}$$\nWe can factor $p$ from the numerator and denominator (since $p \\neq 0$):\n$$P(\\text{Fetus is RhD+}) = \\frac{p(p+q)}{p(p+2q)} = \\frac{p+q}{p+2q}$$\nSince $p+q=1$, this simplifies to:\n$$P(\\text{Fetus is RhD+}) = \\frac{1}{p+2q}$$\nAnd since $p = 1-q$, we have:\n$$P(\\text{Fetus is RhD+}) = \\frac{1}{(1-q)+2q} = \\frac{1}{1+q}$$\nUsing our calculated value of $q=0.4$:\n$$P(\\text{Fetus is RhD+}) = \\frac{1}{1+0.4} = \\frac{1}{1.4} = \\frac{10}{14} = \\frac{5}{7}$$\nTo provide the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$\\frac{5}{7} \\approx 0.7142857...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.7143$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7143}$$", "id": "4379605"}, {"introduction": "Following the delivery of an RhD-positive infant to an RhD-negative mother, preventing maternal sensitization is paramount to protect future pregnancies.

Laboratory data show anemia with elevated reticulocytes and predominantly unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Your task is to select the most appropriate diagnostic decision pathway that rationally separates immune from nonimmune hemolysis and then narrows the etiology using key discriminators. Use the following well-established facts as the fundamental base for your reasoning:\n- The Direct antiglobulin test (DAT, also called the direct Coombs test) detects immunoglobulin or complement bound in vivo to red blood cells (RBCs). A positive DAT indicates immune-mediated hemolysis; a negative DAT makes immune hemolysis unlikely and raises nonimmune causes.\n- Maternal anti–red cell antibodies capable of crossing the placenta are typically Immunoglobulin G (IgG). ABO incompatibility is most often seen when the mother is blood group O and the infant is group A or B, and may produce a weakly positive DAT. Rhesus D (RhD) disease requires an RhD-negative mother, an RhD-positive infant, and maternal sensitization; it often produces a strongly positive DAT and can be severe.\n- In DAT-negative hemolysis, peripheral smear patterns suggest mechanisms: spherocytes in membrane defects (for example, hereditary spherocytosis), bite or blister cells in oxidant injury (for example, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency), schistocytes in mechanical fragmentation (for example, disseminated intravascular coagulation), and echinocytes in pyruvate kinase deficiency.\n- Enzyme deficiencies are confirmed by enzyme activity assays (for example, G6PD, pyruvate kinase), but activity assays can be falsely normal early in hemolytic crises when reticulocytosis is high.\n- When DAT is positive but ABO and RhD are compatible, minor blood group antibodies (for example, Kell, Duffy, Kidd) should be considered using elution testing and maternal antibody screening.\n\nWhich of the following decision algorithms best integrates the Direct antiglobulin test (DAT), maternal–infant blood group information, peripheral smear morphology, enzyme assays, and patterns of Coombs-negative hemolysis to differentiate etiologies in this neonate?\n\nA. Begin with maternal–infant ABO and Rhesus D (RhD) typing. If incompatible, diagnose hemolytic disease of the newborn and treat; if compatible, proceed directly to enzyme assays (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase). Order the Direct antiglobulin test (DAT) only if enzyme assays are normal. Use the peripheral smear only if DAT is positive.\n\nB. Begin with the Direct antiglobulin test (DAT). If DAT is positive, use maternal–infant ABO and Rhesus D (RhD) typing to categorize: mother blood group O with infant A or B and weak DAT suggests ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn; RhD-negative mother with RhD-positive infant and strong DAT suggests RhD hemolytic disease of the newborn; if ABO/RhD are compatible, perform an elution study from infant red blood cells and maternal antibody screen to identify minor blood group antibodies (for example, Kell, Duffy, Kidd). If DAT is negative, evaluate the peripheral smear: spherocytes suggest hereditary spherocytosis (confirm with eosin-5'-maleimide binding or osmotic fragility testing); bite or blister cells suggest oxidant injury (obtain glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase assay, with caution for falsely normal results during high reticulocytosis); echinocytes with hemolysis suggest pyruvate kinase deficiency (confirm with pyruvate kinase assay); schistocytes suggest microangiopathic hemolysis (evaluate coagulation studies). Use enzyme assays to confirm suspected enzyme defects.\n\nC. Begin with the indirect antiglobulin test (indirect Coombs). If negative, exclude immune hemolysis. If the peripheral smear shows spherocytes, diagnose ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn. If the smear is normal, order glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase assays to identify enzyme deficiencies. Use maternal–infant blood group only to assess transfusion compatibility.\n\nD. Begin with total serum bilirubin. If bilirubin is elevated above the exchange transfusion threshold, order glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase assay first; if bilirubin is below threshold, order the Direct antiglobulin test (DAT).

Based on the provided facts, the Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) is the pivotal first step.\n\n*   **If the DAT is positive**, it indicates immune-mediated hemolysis. The next step is to identify the specific antibody. Maternal and infant ABO/RhD typing is performed. An incompatibility (e.g., O mother/A infant, or RhD-negative mother/RhD-positive infant) points to the likely cause. If major blood groups are compatible, further testing for minor blood group antibodies (like Kell, Duffy) is necessary, as outlined in Fact 5.\n*   **If the DAT is negative**, a non-immune cause is likely.
