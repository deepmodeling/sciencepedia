It is scientifically sound, formally specified, and objective.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Part 1: Expected Number of Surviving Self-Reactive T Cells\n\nLet us define an indicator random variable, $S_i$, for the $i$-th thymocyte, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $N$. Let $S_i = 1$ if the $i$-th thymocyte is self-reactive and survives negative selection, and $S_i = 0$ otherwise.\n\nThe total number of surviving self-reactive T cells in the cohort of $N$ thymocytes is the sum of these indicator variables:\n$$S_{total} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} S_i$$\nWe are asked to find the expected number of such cells, which we denote as $E$. Using the linearity of expectation:\n$$E = E[S_{total}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} S_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[S_i]$$\nFor an indicator variable, the expectation is equal to the probability of the event it indicates. Thus, $E[S_i] = P(S_i=1)$.\nThe event $S_i=1$ occurs if two conditions are met for the $i$-th thymocyte:\n1. It is self-reactive.\n2. It survives negative selection.\n\nThe problem states that the probability of a thymocyte being self-reactive is $p_s$.\n$$P(\\text{self-reactive}) = p_s$$\nThe problem also states that for a self-reactive thymocyte, the probability of survival is $1-d$. This is a conditional probability:\n$$P(\\text{survives} | \\text{self-reactive}) = 1-d$$\nThe probability of the joint event (being self-reactive AND surviving) is the product of the probability of the first event and the conditional probability of the second event given the first:\n$$P(S_i=1) = P(\\text{self-reactive} \\cap \\text{survives}) = P(\\text{survives} | \\text{self-reactive}) \\times P(\\text{self-reactive})$$\nSubstituting the given probabilities:\n$$P(S_i=1) = (1-d) p_s$$\nTherefore, the expectation of a single indicator variable is $E[S_i] = p_s(1-d)$.\n\nSince the thymocytes are assumed to behave independently and identically, $E[S_i]$ is the same for all $i=1, 2, \\dots, N$. The total expected number is:\n$$E = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_s(1-d) = N p_s (1-d)$$\nThis is the analytic expression for the expected number of surviving self-reactive T cells.\n\n### Part 2: Elasticity of the Expected Number\n\nWe need to compute the elasticity of $E$ with respect to the deletion efficiency $d$, defined as:\n$$\\epsilon_{d} = \\frac{d}{E}\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial d}$$\nWe have derived the expression for $E$:\n$$E = N p_s (1-d)$$\nFirst, we calculate the partial derivative of $E$ with respect to $d$. We treat $N$ and $p_s$ as constants.\n$$\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial d} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial d} \\left[ N p_s (1-d) \\right] = N p_s \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial d} (1-d)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial d} = N p_s (0 - 1) = -N p_s$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $E$ and $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial d}$ into the elasticity formula:\n$$\\epsilon_{d} = \\frac{d}{N p_s (1-d)} \\times (-N p_s)$$\nThe term $N p_s$ in the numerator and denominator cancels out, provided $N \\neq 0$ and $p_s \\neq 0$, which are reasonable assumptions for a non-trivial biological system.\n$$\\epsilon_{d} = \\frac{d}{1-d} \\times (-1)$$\n$$\\epsilon_{d} = -\\frac{d}{1-d}$$\nThis is the quantitative measure of the sensitivity of the expected number of surviving self-reactive cells to the deletion efficiency. The negative sign indicates that as deletion efficiency $d$ increases, the expected number $E$ decreases, as expected.\n\nThe two required expressions are $E = N p_s(1-d)$ and $\\epsilon_d = -\\frac{d}{1-d}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} N p_{s} (1-d) & -\\frac{d}{1-d} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4402244"}, {"introduction": "T cells that evade central tolerance must be controlled in the periphery to prevent autoimmune disease.

The activation condition thus becomes:\n$$\\alpha S \\ge S_{c}$$\nTo determine the effective minimal unmodulated signal required for activation under PD-1 engagement, we must solve this inequality for the original signal strength $S$:\n$$S \\ge \\frac{S_{c}}{\\alpha}$$\nThis inequality shows that under PD-1 engagement, the unmodulated signal $S$ must now reach a new, higher effective threshold, which we can denote as $S'_{c}$:\n$$S'_{c} = \\frac{S_{c}}{\\alpha}$$\nThe problem asks for the change in the activation threshold, which is the difference between this new PD-1–conditioned effective threshold and the baseline threshold $S_{c}$. Let this change be $\\Delta S_{c}$.\n$$\\Delta S_{c} = S'_{c} - S_{c}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $S'_{c}$ and $S_{c}$:\n$$\\Delta S_{c} = \\frac{S_{c}}{\\alpha} - S_{c}$$\nFactoring out $S_{c}$, we obtain the final expression for the change in the threshold:\n$$\\Delta S_{c} = S_{c} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha} - 1\\right) = S_{c} \\left(\\frac{1 - \\alpha}{\\alpha}\\right) = \\frac{S_{c}(1-\\alpha)}{\\alpha}$$\nSince $0 < \\alpha < 1$, it follows that $1-\\alpha > 0$, and thus $\\Delta S_{c} > 0$. This confirms that PD-1 engagement increases the signal strength required for T cell activation, consistent with its role as an inhibitory receptor.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Ratio of Activation Likelihoods**\n\nThe likelihood of activation is the probability that the signal strength surpasses the relevant activation threshold. Under PD-1 engagement, this threshold for the unmodulated signal is $S'_{c} = S_{c}/\\alpha$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the unmodulated signal strengths for self and foreign antigens, $S_{\\text{self}}$ and $S_{\\text{foreign}}$, are exponential random variables with rate parameters $\\lambda_{s}$ and $\\lambda_{f}$, respectively.
