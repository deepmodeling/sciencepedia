By constructing this end-to-end probabilistic model, you will learn to quantitatively assess how different safety interventions collectively contribute to reducing overall system risk.", "problem": "A hospital uses Bar-Code Medication Administration (BCMA) to reduce wrong-patient or wrong-drug medication errors. Medications are retrieved from an Automated Dispensing Cabinet (ADC), then at the bedside the nurse scans both the medication barcode and the patient wristband barcode to cross-check with the electronic medication administration record. Consider the following model for a single medication administration:\n- The ADC retrieval is incorrect with probability $r_{A}$, representing a wrong drug reaching the bedside due to selection or stocking error.\n- The medication barcode scan fails with probability $r_{M}$ due to unreadable or missing barcodes.\n- The patient wristband scan fails with probability $r_{P}$ due to damaged or missing wristbands.\n- If both bedside scans succeed, BCMA will block any wrong-drug administration with probability $1$.\n- If at least one of the two scans fails, the cross-check is unavailable; in those cases, a nurse may proceed via override with probability $r_{O}$, in which case a wrong-drug administration is not intercepted.\nAssume that $A$ (ADC error), $M$ (medication scan failure), and $P$ (patient scan failure) are independent events, and that the override decision is independent of the ADC error and depends only on the unavailability of the cross-check. Use only basic probability rules and independence to derive the joint risk of a wrong-drug administration reaching the patient.\n\nBaseline rates are $r_{A}=0.002$, $r_{M}=0.015$, $r_{P}=0.008$, and $r_{O}=0.25$. The hospital plans three system-level controls:\n1. Redesign ADC bin lighting and guided picking to reduce $r_{A}$ by $35\\%$.\n2. Barcode quality improvement and wristband reprint policy to reduce $r_{M}$ by $40\\%$ and $r_{P}$ by $25\\%$.\n3. A hard-stop policy that reduces the conditional override probability to $r_{O}^{\\prime}=k\\,r_{O}$ for some factor $k \\in (0,1]$.\n\nLet the post-intervention parameters be $r_{A}^{\\prime}=0.65\\,r_{A}$, $r_{M}^{\\prime}=0.60\\,r_{M}$, $r_{P}^{\\prime}=0.75\\,r_{P}$, and $r_{O}^{\\prime}=k\\,r_{O}$.

Express your final answer for $k$ as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the joint risk of a wrong-drug administration and the computation of a control parameter $k$ to meet a specified risk target. The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded in risk analysis and probability theory, so a solution can be derived.\n\nLet $E$ be the event that a wrong-drug administration reaches the patient. For this to occur, a sequence of failures must happen:\n$1$. An initial error must be made in retrieving the medication from the Automated Dispensing Cabinet (ADC). Let this event be $A$. The probability is given as $P(A) = r_A$.\n$2$. This error must not be intercepted by the Bar-Code Medication Administration (BCMA) system at the bedside.\n\nThe BCMA system intercepts an error if and only if both the medication barcode scan and the patient wristband scan are successful. Let $M$ be the event that the medication scan fails, with $P(M) = r_M$, and $P$ be the event that the patient scan fails, with $P(P) = r_P$.\nThe BCMA check fails if at least one of these scans fails. This corresponds to the event $M \\cup P$.\n\nIf the BCMA check fails (i.e., event $M \\cup P$ occurs), the system provides a warning. The problem states that the nurse may override this warning and proceed with the administration. Let $O$ be the event of a nurse override. This override is conditional upon the BCMA check failing. The problem gives the conditional probability $P(O | M \\cup P) = r_O$. An override means the wrong drug is administered.\n\nA wrong-drug administration $E$ thus occurs if and only if event $A$ occurs, followed by the failure of the BCMA check and a subsequent override. This can be expressed as the intersection of events:\n$$E = A \\cap (M \\cup P) \\cap O$$\nWe need to find $P(E)$. The problem states that $A$, $M$, and $P$ are independent events. It also states that the override decision $O$ is independent of the ADC error $A$ and depends only on the scan failure event $M \\cup P$.\nThis implies that event $A$ is independent of the compound event $((M \\cup P) \\cap O)$. Using the product rule for independent events:\n$$P(E) = P(A) \\cdot P((M \\cup P) \\cap O)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, we can write:\n$$P((M \\cup P) \\cap O) = P(O | M \\cup P) \\cdot P(M \\cup P)$$\nThe problem gives $P(O | M \\cup P) = r_O$.\nTo find $P(M \\cup P)$, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for probability:\n$$P(M \\cup P) = P(M) + P(P) - P(M \\cap P)$$\nSince $M$ and $P$ are independent events, $P(M \\cap P) = P(M)P(P) = r_M r_P$.\nSubstituting this, we get:\n$$P(M \\cup P) = r_M + r_P - r_M r_P$$\nCombining all the pieces, the expression for the joint risk of a wrong-drug administration is:\n$$P(E) = P(A) \\cdot P(O | M \\cup P) \\cdot P(M \\cup P) = r_A \\cdot r_O \\cdot (r_M + r_P - r_M r_P)$$\nThis is the general expression for the risk.\n\nNext, we consider the post-intervention parameters:\n$r_{A}^{\\prime}=0.65\\,r_{A}$\n$r_{M}^{\\prime}=0.60\\,r_{M}$\n$r_{P}^{\\prime}=0.75\\,r_{P}$\n$r_{O}^{\\prime}=k\\,r_{O}$\n\nThe baseline rates are $r_{A}=0.002$, $r_{M}=0.015$, $r_{P}=0.008$, and $r_{O}=0.25$.\nLet's compute the new baseline probabilities:\n$r_{A}^{\\prime} = 0.65 \\times 0.002 = 0.0013$\n$r_{M}^{\\prime} = 0.60 \\times 0.015 = 0.009$\n$r_{P}^{\\prime} = 0.75 \\times 0.008 = 0.006$\nThe post-intervention conditional override probability is not a fixed value but is given as $r_O' = k \\cdot r_O = k \\cdot 0.25$.\n\nThe post-intervention risk, $P(E')$, is given by the same formula with the primed parameters:\n$$P(E') = r_{A}^{\\prime} \\cdot r_{O}^{\\prime} \\cdot (r_{M}^{\\prime} + r_{P}^{\\prime} - r_{M}^{\\prime}r_{P}^{\\prime})$$\n$$P(E') = r_{A}^{\\prime} \\cdot (k \\cdot r_{O}) \\cdot (r_{M}^{\\prime} + r_{P}^{\\prime} - r_{M}^{\\prime}r_{P}^{\\prime})$$\nThe hospital's target is to achieve a risk no greater than $t=3.0 \\times 10^{-6}$. So we must satisfy the inequality:\n$$P(E') \\le t$$\nThe question asks for the \"smallest value of $k$ that meets the target\". Since the risk $P(E')$ is directly proportional to $k$ for $k \\in (0,1]$, a smaller $k$ corresponds to a lower risk. Any $k$ below a certain threshold will meet the target. The phrase \"smallest value of $k$\" is interpreted as asking for the boundary case where the risk is exactly equal to the target, $P(E')=t$. This value represents the maximum permissible value of $k$ (i.e., the least stringent policy) that still satisfies the safety goal.\n\nWe solve for $k$ by setting $P(E') = t$:\n$$k = \\frac{t}{r_{A}^{\\prime} \\cdot r_{O} \\cdot (r_{M}^{\\prime} + r_{P}^{\\prime} - r_{M}^{\\prime}r_{P}^{\\prime})}$$\nFirst, we compute the term for the probability of scan failure:\n$$P(M' \\cup P') = r_{M}^{\\prime} + r_{P}^{\\prime} - r_{M}^{\\prime}r_{P}^{\\prime} = 0.009 + 0.006 - (0.009)(0.006)$$\n$$P(M' \\cup P') = 0.015 - 0.000054 = 0.014946$$\nNow, substitute the values into the equation for $k$:\n$$k = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-6}}{(0.0013) \\cdot (0.25) \\cdot (0.014946)}$$\n$$k = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-6}}{(0.000325) \\cdot (0.014946)}$$\n$$k = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-6}}{4.85745 \\times 10^{-6}}$$\n$$k = \\frac{3.0}{4.85745} \\approx 0.61763500$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$k \\approx 0.6176$$\nThis value lies within the specified domain $k \\in (0, 1]$.\nThis means that the conditional override probability $r_O$ must be reduced by a factor of at least $1 - 0.6176 = 0.3824$, or $38.24\\%$, to meet the target risk level, given the other improvements.

The outcomes are defined by the true state of nature (either $H_0$ or $H_1$) and the decision made based on the score $s$ and threshold $t$. The two types of errors that incur non-zero costs are False Positives and False Negatives.\n\nA False Positive (FP) occurs when the system accepts a match ($s \\ge t$) but the match is actually wrong ($H_0$ is true).

The probability of this event is $P(\\text{Reject}, H_1) = P(s < t | H_1) P(H_1)$.\n\nThe total risk $R(t)$ is the sum of the expected costs from these two errors:\n$$ R(t) = C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\cdot P(\\text{Accept}, H_0) + C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\cdot P(\\text{Reject}, H_1) $$\nSubstituting the prior probabilities and conditional probabilities of decisions:\n$$ R(t) = C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\pi_0 P(s \\ge t | H_0) + C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\pi_1 P(s < t | H_1) $$\nThe conditional probabilities are found by integrating the respective probability density functions (PDFs) over the decision regions. Let $p(s|H_0)$ and $p(s|H_1)$ be the PDFs for the score $s$ under hypotheses $H_0$ and $H_1$, respectively.\n$$ P(s \\ge t | H_0) = \\int_{t}^{\\infty} p(s|H_0) \\, ds $$\n$$ P(s < t | H_1) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} p(s|H_1) \\, ds $$\nThus, the expected loss as a function of the threshold $t$ is:\n$$ R(t) = C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\pi_0 \\int_{t}^{\\infty} p(s|H_0) \\, ds + C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\pi_1 \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} p(s|H_1) \\, ds $$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation and Solution for the Optimal Threshold $t^{\\ast}$**\n\nTo find the threshold $t^{\\ast}$ that minimizes the risk $R(t)$, we must differentiate $R(t)$ with respect to $t$ and set the result to zero. We use the Leibniz rule for differentiation of integrals: $\\frac{d}{dx}\\int_{a}^{x}f(y)dy = f(x)$ and $\\frac{d}{dx}\\int_{x}^{b}f(y)dy = -f(x)$.\n\nDifferentiating $R(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dR(t)}{dt} = C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\pi_0 \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\int_{t}^{\\infty} p(s|H_0) \\, ds \\right) + C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\pi_1 \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} p(s|H_1) \\, ds \\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{dR(t)}{dt} = C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\pi_0 (-p(t|H_0)) + C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\pi_1 (p(t|H_1)) $$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find the optimal threshold $t^{\\ast}$:\n$$ -C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\pi_0 p(t^{\\ast}|H_0) + C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\pi_1 p(t^{\\ast}|H_1) = 0 $$\nThis yields the characteristic condition for the optimal threshold:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\pi_1 p(t^{\\ast}|H_1) = C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\pi_0 p(t^{\\ast}|H_0) $$\nThis condition can be expressed in terms of the likelihood ratio $\\Lambda(t) = \\frac{p(t|H_1)}{p(t|H_0)}$:\n$$ \\Lambda(t^{\\ast}) = \\frac{p(t^{\\ast}|H_1)}{p(t^{\\ast}|H_0)} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\pi_0}{C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\pi_1} $$\nNow we substitute the given Gaussian PDFs into this condition.
