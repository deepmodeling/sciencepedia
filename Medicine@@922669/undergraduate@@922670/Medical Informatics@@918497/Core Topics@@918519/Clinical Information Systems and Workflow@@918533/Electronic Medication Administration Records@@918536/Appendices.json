The provided information is sufficient to derive the solution.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived from first principles as requested.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nLet $V$ represent the volume of the medication solution and $D$ represent the dose of the active drug. The problem states that for a solution of constant concentration, the dose is directly proportional to the volume. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$D = k V$$\nwhere $k$ is the constant of proportionality, representing the concentration of the drug in the solution (e.g., in units of mg/mL).\n\nThe calculated, or ideal, dose $D_{calc}$ corresponds to the calculated volume $V_{calc}$:\n$$D_{calc} = k V_{calc}$$\nThe administered, or recorded, dose $D_{admin}$ corresponds to the volume recorded in the eMAR, $V_{rec}$, which is the result of rounding $V_{calc}$:\n$$D_{admin} = k V_{rec}$$\n\nThe error analysis begins with the definition of absolute error. The absolute error in the dose, $\\Delta D$, is the difference between the administered dose and the calculated dose:\n$$\\Delta D = D_{admin} - D_{calc} = k V_{rec} - k V_{calc} = k (V_{rec} - V_{calc})$$\n\nThe relative error in the dose, $\\epsilon_{D}$, is the absolute error divided by the true (calculated) value:\n$$\\epsilon_{D} = \\frac{\\Delta D}{D_{calc}} = \\frac{k (V_{rec} - V_{calc})}{k V_{calc}}$$\nThe concentration constant $k$ cancels out, demonstrating that the relative dose deviation is equivalent to the relative volume deviation, provided the concentration is constant.\n$$\\epsilon_{D} = \\frac{V_{rec} - V_{calc}}{V_{calc}}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the \"absolute relative dose deviation,\" which is the absolute value of the relative error, $|\\epsilon_{D}|$:\n$$|\\epsilon_{D}| = \\left| \\frac{V_{rec} - V_{calc}}{V_{calc}} \\right|$$\n\nNow, we must determine $V_{rec}$ based on the given rounding policy. The calculated volume is $V_{calc} = 0.36$ mL. The measurable increments are integer multiples of $\\Delta V_{min} = 0.1$ mL, which are $..., 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, ...$ mL.\n\nWe must find the increment nearest to $0.36$ mL. The two closest measurable increments are $0.3$ mL and $0.4$ mL. We compare the absolute differences:\n- Distance to $0.3$ mL: $|0.36 - 0.3| = 0.06$ mL.\n- Distance to $0.4$ mL: $|0.36 - 0.4| = |-0.04| = 0.04$ mL.\n\nSince $0.04  0.06$, the nearest measurable increment to $0.36$ mL is $0.4$ mL. The tie-breaking rule (rounding half-increments up) does not apply in this case, as $0.36$ is not a half-increment. Thus, the recorded/administered volume is:\n$$V_{rec} = 0.4 \\text{ mL}$$\n\nWe can now substitute the values of $V_{calc}$ and $V_{rec}$ into the formula for the absolute relative dose deviation:\n$$|\\epsilon_{D}| = \\left| \\frac{0.4 - 0.36}{0.36} \\right|$$\n$$|\\epsilon_{D}| = \\left| \\frac{0.04}{0.36} \\right|$$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$|\\epsilon_{D}| = \\frac{4}{36} = \\frac{1}{9}$$\n\nTo provide the final numerical answer, we convert the fraction to a decimal and round to four significant figures as required.\n$$|\\epsilon_{D}| = \\frac{1}{9} = 0.111111...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$|\\epsilon_{D}| \\approx 0.1111$$\nThis is the absolute relative dose deviation expressed as a dimensionless decimal fraction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1111}$$", "id": "4837438"}, {"introduction": "Modern eMAR systems integrate safety features like barcode scanning to prevent medication errors, generating alerts for mismatches.

The denominator, $P(A)$, is the total probability of an alert being issued. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, by conditioning on whether a true mismatch has occurred ($M$) or not ($\\neg M$):\n$$\nP(A) = P(A \\mid M) P(M) + P(A \\mid \\neg M) P(\\neg M)\n$$\n\nWe need to express the terms in this expansion using the given parameters $S$, $C$, and $p$.\n1.  $P(A \\mid M) = S$.\n2.  $P(M) = p$.\n3.
