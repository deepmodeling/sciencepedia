System response time is negligible for this task, and any final submission action is identical across designs and can be ignored for time savings. Use cognitive chunking to determine how many $M$ operators are needed in each design.

Cognitive chunking from human information processing allows reduction of the number of $M$ operators by grouping related actions into coherent units; we therefore assign $M$ before each field in the unchunked current design and before each chunk in the redesigned interface.\n\nWe compute the total time for each design by counting occurrences of $K$, $P$, $H$, and $M$, then multiplying by their standard times: $K = 0.28$ s, $P = 1.10$ s, $H = 0.40$ s, $M = 1.35$ s.\n\nCurrent design:\n- Data fields and types in order: numeric, dropdown, numeric, dropdown, numeric, numeric, numeric, numeric.\n- Numeric digit keystrokes: Heart rate $3$, Diastolic blood pressure $2$, Temperature $4$, Systolic blood pressure $3$, Dose $3$, Time given $4$.

Let $N$ be the total number of one-minute epochs in the monitoring period. The duration is specified as $8$ hours.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of minutes, $N$:\n$$ N = 8 \\text{ hours} \\times \\frac{60 \\text{ minutes}}{1 \\text{ hour}} = 480 \\text{ minutes} $$\n\nFor each minute $i$, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $N$, we can define a random variable $X_i$ that represents the occurrence of a false alarm. The problem states that there can be at most one alarm per minute. Therefore, $X_i$ can be modeled as a Bernoulli random variable:\n$$\nX_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n1  \\text{if a false alarm occurs in minute } i \\\\\n0  \\text{if no false alarm occurs in minute } i\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe probability of a false alarm in any given minute is given as $p = 0.02$. This is the \"success\" probability for the Bernoulli trial.\n$$ P(X_i = 1) = p = 0.02 $$\n\nThe expected value of a single Bernoulli random variable $X_i$ is given by:\n$$ E[X_i] = (1 \\times P(X_i=1)) + (0 \\times P(X_i=0)) = P(X_i=1) = p $$\n\nLet $Y$ be the total number of false alarms over the entire $8$-hour period. $Y$ is the sum of the individual Bernoulli random variables for each minute:\n$$ Y = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i $$\n\nWe are asked to compute the expected number of false alarms, which is $E[Y]$. The problem statement specifies that the minute-to-minute false-alarm events are independent and identically distributed. Due to the linearity of expectation, the expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expectations.\n$$ E[Y] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i] $$\n\nSince the events are identically distributed, $E[X_i] = p$ for all $i$.\n$$ E[Y] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p = N \\times p $$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values for $N$ and $p$:\n$$ E[Y] = 480 \\times 0.02 $$\n$$ E[Y] = 480 \\times \\frac{2}{100} = 4.8 \\times 2 = 9.6 $$\n\nThus, the expected number of false alarms in a single monitored day is $9.6$.\n\n**Part 2: Qualitative Analysis of HCI Mitigation Strategies**\n\nThe problem asks for a brief, qualitative articulation of how two HCI strategies would change the expected false-alarm count.\n\n1.  **Hysteresis (requiring $k$ consecutive minutes below threshold):**\n    This strategy fundamentally changes the condition for triggering an alarm. In the original model, an alarm is triggered if the condition is met in any single one-minute epoch. Let this event have probability $p = 0.02$. With hysteresis, an alarm is triggered only if the condition is met in $k$ consecutive minutes, where we assume $k \\ge 2$. Since the minute-to-minute events are assumed to be independent, the probability of $k$ consecutive minutes of false-alarm conditions occurring is $p^k$. For $p = 0.02$ and $k \\ge 2$, the value of $p^k$ is substantially smaller than $p$ (e.g., for $k=2$, the probability becomes $0.02^2 = 0.0004$). While the exact calculation of the expected number of alarms is more complex due to overlapping potential alarm intervals, the core effect is that the probability of satisfying the alarm condition at any point in time is drastically reduced. Therefore, implementing hysteresis would be expected to **significantly reduce** the expected number of false alarms.\n\n2.  **Alarm delay of $d$ seconds:**\n    This strategy addresses the transient nature of artifacts that cause false alarms. The original model simplifies a continuous underlying process into one-minute epochs, where an alarm has a probability $p$ of being \"emitted in that minute\". This implies that a threshold crossing of any duration within that minute could contribute to this probability. An alarm delay requires the threshold to be continuously violated for a duration of at least $d$ seconds before an alarm is annunciated. Many artifacts, such as those from patient motion or electromagnetic interference, cause brief, momentary dips in the measured $\\text{SpO}_2$ value. By imposing a delay of $d$ seconds, the system effectively filters out these transient events. Only persistent state changes that last longer than $d$ seconds will trigger an alarm. This makes the condition for a false alarm more stringent. The effective probability of a false alarm being confirmed and emitted in a given minute, let's call it $p'$, would be lower than the original probability $p$. Consequently, the expected number of false alarms, which would be $N \\times p'$, would be **reduced**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9.6}$$", "id": "4843702"}]}
