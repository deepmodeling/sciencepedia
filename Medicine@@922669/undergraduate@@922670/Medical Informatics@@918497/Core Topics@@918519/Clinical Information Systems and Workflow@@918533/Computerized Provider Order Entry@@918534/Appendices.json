The decision support requires a non-stale serum creatinine and uses a creatinine clearance estimated by the Cockcroft–Gault equation to select the dosing interval. For safety, the CPOE policy defines a serum creatinine measurement as stale if it was drawn more than $24$ hours before the time of order entry. Only non-stale values may be used to estimate renal function for initial dosing.

The final answer must be a single number with no units in the answer box.", "solution": "The problem will be solved by following the sequence of operations dictated by the computerized provider order entry (CPOE) system's policy.\n\nFirst, we must validate the problem statement.\nThe problem provides a clear, self-contained scenario grounded in medical informatics and clinical practice. All necessary data are provided:\n- Patient Age: $68$ years\n- Patient Sex: male\n- Patient Actual Body Mass: $72$ $\\mathrm{kg}$\n- Serum Creatinine $1$: $1.2$ $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ drawn $50$ hours ago\n- Serum Creatinine $2$: $1.6$ $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ drawn $6$ hours ago\n- CPOE Policy for Stale Data: A serum creatinine is stale if it was drawn more than $24$ hours before the time of order entry. Only non-stale values may be used.\n- CPOE Rounding Rule: The estimated creatinine clearance is rounded to two significant figures.\n- Dosing Interval Mapping Rule:\n    - If rounded creatinine clearance $\\geq 60$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$, interval is $24$ hours.\n    - If $40 \\leq$ rounded creatinine clearance $< 60$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$, interval is $36$ hours.\n    - If $20 \\leq$ rounded creatinine clearance $< 40$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$, interval is $48$ hours.\n    - If rounded creatinine clearance $< 20$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$, interval is $72$ hours.\nThe problem uses the Cockcroft–Gault equation, a standard clinical estimation tool. The scenario is scientifically sound and the problem is well-posed, with a clear path to a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe first step is to select the appropriate serum creatinine value according to the CPOE policy.\nThe policy states that a serum creatinine measurement is stale if drawn more than $24$ hours ago.\n- The first result, $1.2$ $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$, was drawn $50$ hours ago. Since $50 \\text{ hours} > 24 \\text{ hours}$, this value is stale and must be discarded.\n- The second result, $1.6$ $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$, was drawn $6$ hours ago. Since $6 \\text{ hours} \\leq 24 \\text{ hours}$, this value is non-stale and will be used by the CPOE system.\nThus, the serum creatinine level to be used is $\\mathrm{SCr} = 1.6$ $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n\nThe second step is to calculate the estimated creatinine clearance ($CrCl_{est}$) using the Cockcroft–Gault equation. For a male patient, the equation is:\n$$CrCl_{est} = \\frac{(140 - \\text{Age}) \\times \\text{Mass}}{72 \\times \\mathrm{SCr}}$$\nWhere Age is in years, Mass is in $\\mathrm{kg}$, and SCr is in $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Age = $68$\n- Mass = $72$\n- SCr = $1.6$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$CrCl_{est} = \\frac{(140 - 68) \\times 72}{72 \\times 1.6}$$\n\nNow, we perform the calculation:\n$$CrCl_{est} = \\frac{72 \\times 72}{72 \\times 1.6}$$\nThe term $72$ in the numerator and denominator can be cancelled:\n$$CrCl_{est} = \\frac{72}{1.6}$$\n$$CrCl_{est} = 45$$\nThe estimated creatinine clearance is $45$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$.\n\nThe third step is to apply the CPOE's rounding rule. The rule requires rounding the estimated creatinine clearance to two significant figures. The calculated value, $45$, already has exactly two significant figures. Therefore, the rounded creatinine clearance is $45$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$.\n\nThe final step is to use this rounded creatinine clearance value to determine the dosing interval from the CPOE's interval mapping rule.\nThe rounded creatinine clearance is $45$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$. We check this value against the rule's conditions:\n- Is $45 \\geq 60$? No.\n- Is $40 \\leq 45 < 60$? Yes. This condition is met.\n- The corresponding dosing interval is $36$ hours.\n\nThe CPOE system will select a dosing interval of $36$ hours.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{36}$$", "id": "4830618"}, {"introduction": "Effective CPOE systems don't just enforce arbitrary rules; their logic is grounded in deep scientific principles. This exercise [@problem_id:4830636] moves beyond rote calculation to explore the pharmacokinetic reasoning behind a common dosing strategy for chemotherapy.

Your justification should not rely on memorized formulas; derive the preference by relating scaling of $CL$ to the desired goal of achieving stable $\\mathit{AUC}$ across adults.", "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in established pharmacokinetic principles and clinical practices, is well-posed with all necessary information provided for both the calculation and the justification, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We may, therefore, proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is composed of two parts: first, a calculation of an ordered drug dose based on a specific patient's parameters, and second, a justification for the dosing methodology itself based on pharmacokinetic principles.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Ordered Dose ($D$)**\n\nWe are given the following information for the patient and the cytotoxic agent:\n- Patient height, $h = 172 \\mathrm{ cm}$\n- Patient weight, $w = 95 \\mathrm{ kg}$\n- Protocol dose intensity for the cytotoxic agent, $d = 60 \\mathrm{ mg/m}^{2}$\n\nThe Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE) system first calculates the Body Surface Area (BSA) using the formula:\n$$ \\mathit{BSA} = \\sqrt{\\frac{h \\cdot w}{3600}} $$\nSubstituting the patient's specific parameters into this equation:\n$$ \\mathit{BSA} = \\sqrt{\\frac{172 \\cdot 95}{3600}} $$\nWe first compute the product in the numerator:\n$$ 172 \\cdot 95 = 16340 $$\nNow, the expression for BSA becomes:\n$$ \\mathit{BSA} = \\sqrt{\\frac{16340}{3600}} \\approx \\sqrt{4.53888...} $$\nEvaluating the square root gives the patient's BSA:\n$$ \\mathit{BSA} \\approx 2.130466 \\mathrm{ m}^{2} $$\nThe CPOE system then applies the rule for cytotoxic agents, which includes a cap on the BSA value used for dose calculation. The rule is:\n$$ D = d \\cdot \\min(\\mathit{BSA}, 2.0) $$\nHere, the calculated $\\mathit{BSA}$ of approximately $2.13 \\mathrm{ m}^{2}$ is greater than the cap of $2.0 \\mathrm{ m}^{2}$. Therefore, the value used in the dose calculation is the minimum of the two, which is $2.0 \\mathrm{ m}^{2}$.\n$$ \\min(2.130466..., 2.0) = 2.0 $$\nWe can now calculate the final ordered dose, $D$, using the capped $\\mathit{BSA}$ value and the given dose intensity, $d = 60 \\mathrm{ mg/m}^{2}$.\n$$ D = 60 \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{m}^{2}} \\cdot 2.0 \\mathrm{ m}^{2} $$\n$$ D = 120 \\mathrm{ mg} $$\nThe problem requires the final dose to be rounded to four significant figures. To express $120$ with four significant figures, we write it as $120.0$.\n\n**Part 2: Justification for BSA-based Dosing**\n\nThe objective is to justify the preference for BSA-based dosing for cytotoxic agents over weight-based dosing, starting from fundamental principles. The primary therapeutic goal in dosing is to achieve a consistent, predictable drug exposure across a population of patients to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity. Drug exposure is quantified by the Area Under the concentration-time Curve ($\\mathit{AUC}$).\n\nThe problem provides the fundamental pharmacokinetic relationship:\n$$ \\mathit{AUC} = \\frac{\\mathit{Dose}}{CL} $$\nwhere $CL$ is the drug clearance, a measure of the body's efficiency in eliminating the drug.\n\nTo achieve a target exposure, $\\mathit{AUC}_{\\text{target}}$, for all patients, the dosing regimen must be adjusted to account for inter-patient variability in clearance. Rearranging the equation, the ideal dose for an individual patient is directly proportional to their clearance:\n$$ \\mathit{Dose} = \\mathit{AUC}_{\\text{target}} \\cdot CL $$\nThis means that for the dose to be optimal, it must scale with the same physiological parameter that $CL$ scales with. Let us analyze the two dosing strategies in this context.\n\n1.  **Weight-based dosing ($D_{\\mathrm{kg}} = k \\cdot w$)**: This strategy assumes that drug clearance is directly proportional to body weight ($w$).\n    If $CL \\propto w$, we can write $CL = c_w \\cdot w$, where $c_w$ is a constant of proportionality. Substituting this into the ideal dose equation gives:\n    $$ \\mathit{Dose} = \\mathit{AUC}_{\\text{target}} \\cdot (c_w \\cdot w) = (\\mathit{AUC}_{\\text{target}} \\cdot c_w) \\cdot w $$\n    Letting $k = \\mathit{AUC}_{\\text{target}} \\cdot c_w$, we recover the weight-based dosing formula, $D_{\\mathrm{kg}} = k \\cdot w$. This dosing strategy is therefore optimal *only if* clearance scales linearly with weight.\n\n2.  **BSA-based dosing ($D = d \\cdot \\mathit{BSA}$)**: This strategy assumes that drug clearance is directly proportional to Body Surface Area ($\\mathit{BSA}$).\n    If $CL \\propto \\mathit{BSA}$, we can write $CL = c_{\\mathit{BSA}} \\cdot \\mathit{BSA}$, where $c_{\\mathit{BSA}}$ is a constant of proportionality. Substituting this into the ideal dose equation gives:\n    $$ \\mathit{Dose} = \\mathit{AUC}_{\\text{target}} \\cdot (c_{\\mathit{BSA}} \\cdot \\mathit{BSA}) = (\\mathit{AUC}_{\\text{target}} \\cdot c_{\\mathit{BSA}}) \\cdot \\mathit{BSA} $$\n    Letting $d = \\mathit{AUC}_{\\text{target}} \\cdot c_{\\mathit{BSA}}$, we recover the BSA-based dosing formula, $D = d \\cdot \\mathit{BSA}$. This strategy is optimal *only if* clearance scales linearly with BSA.\n\nThe problem explicitly states a \"well-supported empirical observation that for many cytotoxic agents adult clearance $CL$ scales more closely with $\\mathit{BSA}$ than with $w$.\" Given this premise, it follows directly that to achieve the goal of a stable $\\mathit{AUC}$ across the adult population, the dose must be scaled according to BSA. Using a BSA-based dosing rule aligns the dose with the primary determinant of the drug's elimination rate ($CL$). Choosing a weight-based rule would lead to under-dosing or over-dosing in individuals whose BSA-to-weight ratio deviates from the population average, resulting in greater variability in $\\mathit{AUC}$ and, consequently, more variable therapeutic outcomes and toxicity.\n\nTherefore, the CPOE system's logic to employ BSA-based dosing for cytotoxic agents is justified as it is founded on the principle of matching the administered dose to the patient's individual drug clearance, thereby minimizing inter-patient variability in drug exposure. The $\\mathit{BSA}$ cap of $2.0 \\mathrm{ m}^2$ is an additional safety constraint layered on top of this principle to mitigate the risk of severe toxicity in obese patients, where BSA may overestimate metabolic/clearance capacity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{120.0}$$", "id": "4830636"}, {"introduction": "Even a technically accurate CPOE alert can fail in practice if it is not trusted by clinicians.

Express your result as a decimal between $0$ and $1$, and round your answer to $4$ significant figures. Then, briefly interpret the magnitude of this value in terms of alert fatigue in CPOE, based on first principles about how users respond to frequent false alerts.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard application of Bayesian probability to evaluate the performance of a clinical decision support system, a common task in medical informatics. All necessary parameters—sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence—are provided, and the term \"false alert rate\" is unambiguously defined. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $C$: The event that a true contraindication exists for a given medication order.\n- $\\neg C$: The event that no true contraindication exists.\n- $A$: The event that the CPOE system fires an alert for the order.\n- $\\neg A$: The event that the system does not fire an alert.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we can extract the following probabilities:\n1.  The prevalence of true contraindications is $P(C) = 0.02$. This is the prior probability of a contraindication.\n2.  The probability of no contraindication is therefore $P(\\neg C) = 1 - P(C) = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98$.\n3.  The sensitivity of the alert is the probability that it fires given a true contraindication exists. This is the true positive rate: $P(A|C) = 0.9$.\n4.  The specificity of the alert is the probability that it does not fire given no true contraindication exists. This is the true negative rate: $P(\\neg A|\\neg C) = 0.95$.\n\nFrom the specificity, we can deduce the false positive rate, which is the probability of an alert firing in the absence of a true contraindication:\n$P(A|\\neg C) = 1 - P(\\neg A|\\neg C) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n\nThe problem asks for the \"false alert rate,\" which is defined as \"the probability that, given an alert fires, there is in fact no true contraindication.\" This corresponds to the conditional probability $P(\\neg C|A)$.\n\nTo compute this value, we apply Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(\\neg C|A) = \\frac{P(A|\\neg C) P(\\neg C)}{P(A)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(A)$, is the overall probability of an alert firing for any given order. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, which marginalizes over the state of the contraindication:\n$$P(A) = P(A|C)P(C) + P(A|\\neg C)P(\\neg C)$$\n\nLet's compute the two terms in the expression for $P(A)$:\n- The probability of a true positive alert (an alert fires and a contraindication exists) is $P(A \\cap C) = P(A|C)P(C) = (0.9) \\times (0.02) = 0.018$.\n- The probability of a false positive alert (an alert fires but no contraindication exists) is $P(A \\cap \\neg C) = P(A|\\neg C)P(\\neg C) = (0.05) \\times (0.98) = 0.049$.\n\nThe total probability of an alert is the sum of these two mutually exclusive events:\n$$P(A) = 0.018 + 0.049 = 0.067$$\n\nNow we can substitute the values back into the Bayes' theorem formula for the false alert rate, $P(\\neg C|A)$:\n$$P(\\neg C|A) = \\frac{P(A|\\neg C) P(\\neg C)}{P(A)} = \\frac{0.049}{0.067}$$\n\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$P(\\neg C|A) \\approx 0.73134328...$$\n\nRounding the result to $4$ significant figures, as requested, yields $0.7313$.\n\n**Interpretation of the result:**\nThe calculated false alert rate is approximately $0.7313$. This signifies that when a clinician receives an alert from this CPOE system, there is a $73.13\\%$ probability that the alert is false, meaning no true contraindication actually exists. This is a remarkably high rate of false positives among the triggered alerts.\n\nFrom first principles of human-computer interaction and psychology, this high false alert rate is a primary cause of **alert fatigue**. When users, in this case clinicians, are frequently exposed to warnings that prove to be irrelevant or incorrect, they become desensitized. The cognitive cost of evaluating each alert is high, and if the majority of these evaluations lead to the conclusion that the alert is ignorable, users will adapt by developing a heuristic to dismiss alerts with minimal investigation. This learned behavior is a significant patient safety risk, as it increases the likelihood that a true, critical alert will be inadvertently overridden along with the \"noise\" of the false alerts. In this specific scenario, a clinician is likely to conclude that nearly three out of every four alerts are spurious, which would severely undermine their trust in the system and promote the dangerous practice of routinely ignoring them. This phenomenon illustrates the critical importance of optimizing an alerting system's specificity and positive predictive value, especially in environments with low prevalence of the target condition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7313}$$", "id": "4830580"}]}
