It is based on fundamental principles of probability theory (Bayes' theorem) and is a standard application in medical informatics and epidemiology, specifically in evaluating the performance of a diagnostic or screening tool. The provided parameters ($\\pi$, $TPR$, $FPR$) are complete and sufficient to calculate the required posterior probability, known as the Positive Predictive Value (PPV). The values are plausible for a real-world clinical scenario. The problem is free from contradictions, ambiguities, and factual errors.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\nLet $S$ denote the event that a patient truly has sepsis, and let $A$ denote the event that the CDSS fires an alert. The problem provides the following probabilities:\n\n1.  The prior probability of sepsis (prevalence):\n    $$P(S) = \\pi = 0.08$$\n2.  The probability of not having sepsis is the complement:\n    $$P(S^c) = 1 - P(S) = 1 - \\pi = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92$$\n3.  The true positive rate, or sensitivity, is the conditional probability of an alert given that the patient has sepsis:\n    $$P(A \\mid S) = TPR = 0.75$$\n4.  The false positive rate is the conditional probability of an alert given that the patient does not have sepsis:\n    $$P(A \\mid S^c) = FPR = 0.20$$\n\nWe are asked to find the posterior probability $P(S \\mid A)$, which is the probability of having sepsis given that an alert has fired. This is a direct application of Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(S \\mid A) = \\frac{P(A \\mid S) P(S)}{P(A)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(A)$, is the total probability of an alert occurring. It can be calculated using the law of total probability by considering the two mutually exclusive scenarios: an alert for a septic patient and an alert for a non-septic patient.\n$$P(A) = P(A \\cap S) + P(A \\cap S^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(X \\cap Y) = P(X \\mid Y)P(Y)$, we can write:\n$$P(A) = P(A \\mid S)P(S) + P(A \\mid S^c)P(S^c)$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $P(A)$ back into Bayes' theorem gives the desired general formula:\n$$P(S \\mid A) = \\frac{P(A \\mid S) P(S)}{P(A \\mid S)P(S) + P(A \\mid S^c)P(S^c)}$$\n\nIn terms of the given symbolic parameters $\\pi$, $TPR$, and $FPR$, the expression for $P(\\text{sepsis} \\mid \\text{alert})$ is:\n$$P(S \\mid A) = \\frac{(TPR)(\\pi)}{(TPR)(\\pi) + (FPR)(1-\\pi)}$$\nThis is the required analytical expression.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value by substituting the given data:\n$$P(S \\mid A) = \\frac{(0.75)(0.08)}{(0.75)(0.08) + (0.20)(1 - 0.08)}$$\n$$P(S \\mid A) = \\frac{0.06}{0.06 + (0.20)(0.92)}$$\n$$P(S \\mid A) = \\frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.184}$$\n$$P(S \\mid A) = \\frac{0.06}{0.244}$$\n$$P(S \\mid A) \\approx 0.245901639...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.2459$.\n\n**Justification on Clinician Trust and Alert Fatigue**\nThe computed value, $P(\\text{sepsis} \\mid \\text{alert}) \\approx 0.2459$, represents the positive predictive value (PPV) of the CDSS alert. This result indicates that when an alert fires, there is only a probability of approximately 0.2459 that the patient actually has sepsis. Conversely, this implies that approximately $1 - 0.2459 = 0.7541$, or roughly three out of every four alerts, are false positives. A high false alarm rate is a well-documented cause of alert fatigue, a condition where clinicians become desensitized and start to ignore or override system alerts due to a perceived lack of reliability. Given that a vast majority of the alerts are not indicative of true sepsis, clinicians are unlikely to trust the system. This erosion of trust is dangerous, as it can lead to the dismissal of a true positive alert, thereby delaying life-saving treatment and defeating the primary purpose of the early detection system. Therefore, the low PPV strongly suggests that clinicians are likely to mistrust these alerts, leading to significant alert fatigue in routine practice.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2459}$$", "id": "4824907"}, {"introduction": "Having diagnosed the issue of low $PPV$, the next logical step is to consider how to design a better system from the outset.

Let's analyze the relationship between PPV and FPR. In the equation above, all other terms ($\\text{TPR}$, $\\pi$, $1-\\pi$) are positive constants. The FPR appears in the denominator. As FPR increases, the denominator increases, and consequently, the PPV decreases. This means PPV is a monotonically decreasing function of FPR.\n\nTo find the maximum allowable FPR, we must find the FPR value that corresponds to the minimum allowable PPV. The problem states the PPV must be *at least* $0.30$, so the minimum acceptable value is exactly $0.30$. By setting $\\text{PPV} = 0.30$, we solve for the corresponding FPR, which will be the maximum value permissible.\n\nLet $\\text{FPR}_{\\text{max}}$ be the maximum false positive rate.
