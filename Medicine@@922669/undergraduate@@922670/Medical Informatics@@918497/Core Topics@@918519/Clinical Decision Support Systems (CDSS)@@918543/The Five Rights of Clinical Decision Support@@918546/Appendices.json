By working through this scenario, you will develop the critical skill of modeling and evaluating the competing factors inherent in effective CDS design.", "problem": "A hospital implements Clinical Decision Support (CDS), defined as software that delivers patient-specific assessments or recommendations to clinicians at the point of care, to uphold the five rights: right information, right person, right intervention format, right channel, and right time/place. Consider an allergy-check alert for initiating a high-risk antibiotic. The CDS team considers shifting the alert earlier in the medication ordering workflow to improve the right time/place, but doing so triggers a routing constraint: the identity of the ordering prescriber is not yet known at the earlier point, so the alert is probabilistically routed to a pool intended for triage nurses instead of the prescribing physician.\n\nUse the following scientifically plausible parameters. At the later time (after order signing), identity resolution is strong and routing targets the prescribing physician with probability $0.95$, while $0.05$ goes to the triage nurse pool. At the earlier time (during order entry initiation), routing goes to the prescribing physician with probability $0.30$ and to the triage nurse pool with probability $0.70$ due to incomplete identity resolution at that step.\n\nLet adherence be the probability that the recipient performs the recommended action (e.g., resolves the allergy conflict). At the later time, the adherence probability when the prescribing physician receives the alert is $0.48$, and when the triage nurse receives it is $0.15$. At the earlier time, the adherence probability when the prescribing physician receives the alert increases to $0.62$, and when the triage nurse receives it increases to $0.25$, reflecting better timing for acting before the order is finalized. All probabilities are empirically estimated and are independent across orders.\n\nStarting from the core definitions of probability and conditioning, compute the expected adherence at the later time and at the earlier time by appropriately combining routing probabilities and conditional adherence probabilities.

The setup is a direct application of the law of total probability.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the expected adherence probability for two different timings of a clinical alert: a \"later\" time and an \"earlier\" time. The expected adherence is the total probability of adherence, which can be found using the law of total probability. The sample space of alert recipients is partitioned into two mutually exclusive events: the alert is routed to the prescribing physician, or it is routed to the triage nurse pool.\n\nLet us define the following events and probabilities:\n*   $T_L$: The alert is triggered at the later time.\n*   $T_E$: The alert is triggered at the earlier time.\n*   $R_P$: The alert is routed to the prescribing physician.\n*   $R_N$: The alert is routed to the triage nurse pool.\n*   $A$: The recipient adheres to the recommendation.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following probabilities:\n\nFor the later time, $T_L$:\n*   $P(R_P | T_L) = 0.95$\n*   $P(R_N | T_L) = 0.05$\n*   $P(A | R_P \\cap T_L) = 0.48$ (adherence, given physician recipient at later time)\n*   $P(A | R_N \\cap T_L) = 0.15$ (adherence, given nurse recipient at later time)\n\nFor the earlier time, $T_E$:\n*   $P(R_P | T_E) = 0.30$\n*   $P(R_N | T_E) = 0.70$\n*   $P(A | R_P \\cap T_E) = 0.62$ (adherence, given physician recipient at earlier time)\n*   $P(A | R_N \\cap T_E) = 0.25$ (adherence, given nurse recipient at earlier time)\n\nThe expected adherence at the later time, $A_{\\text{late}}$, is the total probability of adherence conditioned on the later time, $P(A | T_L)$. We apply the law of total probability, marginalizing over the recipient type:\n$$A_{\\text{late}} = P(A | T_L) = P(A \\cap R_P | T_L) + P(A \\cap R_N | T_L)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(X \\cap Y | Z) = P(X | Y \\cap Z)P(Y | Z)$, we get:\n$$A_{\\text{late}} = P(A | R_P \\cap T_L) P(R_P | T_L) + P(A | R_N \\cap T_L) P(R_N | T_L)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$A_{\\text{late}} = (0.48)(0.95) + (0.15)(0.05)$$\n$$A_{\\text{late}} = 0.456 + 0.0075$$\n$$A_{\\text{late}} = 0.4635$$\n\nSimilarly, the expected adherence at the earlier time, $A_{\\text{early}}$, is the total probability of adherence conditioned on the earlier time, $P(A | T_E)$:\n$$A_{\\text{early}} = P(A | T_E) = P(A | R_P \\cap T_E) P(R_P | T_E) + P(A | R_N \\cap T_E) P(R_N | T_E)$$\nSubstituting the given values for the earlier time:\n$$A_{\\text{early}} = (0.62)(0.30) + (0.25)(0.70)$$\n$$A_{\\text{early}} = 0.186 + 0.175$$\n$$A_{\\text{early}} = 0.361$$\n\nThe final step is to compute the net effect on adherence, $\\Delta A$, defined as the difference between the early and late adherence probabilities:\n$$\\Delta A = A_{\\text{early}} - A_{\\text{late}}$$\n$$\\Delta A = 0.361 - 0.4635$$\n$$\\Delta A = -0.1025$$\n\nThe problem asks for the result as a unitless decimal rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $-0.1025$ already has four significant figures (the digits $1$, $0$, $2$, and $5$). Therefore, no further rounding is required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.1025}$$", "id": "4860710"}, {"introduction": "The principle of 'garbage in, garbage out' is especially critical in clinical informatics, where the 'Right Information' is the bedrock of any trustworthy decision support tool.

Consider a binary CDS alert designed to identify patients with a true clinical condition (e.g., a drug-laboratory interaction indicating risk) where the “right information” requirement is a single key binary input variable derived from the electronic health record. When this input is correct, the CDS alert behaves as a diagnostic test with sensitivity $Se$ and specificity $Sp$ for the true condition, whose prevalence in the target population is $p$. However, when the input variable is misclassified, the alert may invert relative to its error-free state.\n\nAssume the following scientifically plausible parameters: sensitivity $Se = 0.85$, specificity $Sp = 0.95$, and prevalence $p = 0.10$. Model violations of the “right information” as an independent Bernoulli flip of the alert output with probability $m$ for any patient, regardless of the true condition status. That is, with probability $m$ the alert output is inverted relative to what it would have been under correct information, and with probability $1 - m$ it remains as under correct information.\n\nUsing the foundational definitions of sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and Bayes’ theorem, derive the positive predictive value (PPV) under $m=0$ and under $m=0.05$, and then compute the impact defined as the absolute change in PPV, given by the PPV at $m=0.05$ minus the PPV at $m=0$. Express the final answer as a decimal fraction and round to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the impact of information errors on the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of a Clinical Decision Support (CDS) alert. The solution proceeds by first deriving a general formula for the PPV as a function of the information error probability, $m$, and then applying this formula for the specific cases of $m=0$ and $m=0.05$.\n\nLet's define the following events:\n$D$: The patient has the true clinical condition.\n$D^c$: The patient does not have the true clinical condition.\n$A_0$: The alert is positive (fires) assuming correct information.\n$A_m$: The final alert is positive, considering the probability of information error $m$.\n\nThe problem provides the following parameters:\nPrevalence of the condition: $P(D) = p = 0.10$\nSensitivity of the ideal alert: $P(A_0 | D) = Se = 0.85$\nSpecificity of the ideal alert: $P(A_0^c | D^c) = Sp = 0.95$\n\nFrom these, we can deduce other probabilities for the ideal alert:\nProbability of no condition: $P(D^c) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$\nFalse Negative Rate: $P(A_0^c | D) = 1 - Se = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$\nFalse Positive Rate: $P(A_0 | D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$\n\nThe error model states that the final alert output is inverted with probability $m$. A positive final alert ($A_m$) occurs if the ideal alert was positive ($A_0$) and was not inverted (with probability $1-m$), or if the ideal alert was negative ($A_0^c$) and was inverted (with probability $m$). This error process is independent of the patient's true condition.\n\nThe Positive Predictive Value, $\\text{PPV}_m$, is the probability that a patient has the condition given that the final alert is positive, $P(D | A_m)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$ \\text{PPV}_m = P(D | A_m) = \\frac{P(A_m | D) P(D)}{P(A_m)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(A_m)$, can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(A_m) = P(A_m | D) P(D) + P(A_m | D^c) P(D^c) $$\nTo solve this, we must first derive the effective sensitivity, $P(A_m | D)$, and the effective false positive rate, $P(A_m | D^c)$, as functions of $m$.\n\nThe effective sensitivity, let's call it $Se_m$, is $P(A_m | D)$. We find this by conditioning on the state of the ideal alert, $A_0$:\n$$ Se_m = P(A_m | D) = P(A_m | A_0, D) P(A_0 | D) + P(A_m | A_0^c, D) P(A_0^c | D) $$\nGiven the ideal alert was positive ($A_0$), the final alert is positive ($A_m$) if it is not inverted, so $P(A_m | A_0, D) = 1-m$.\nGiven the ideal alert was negative ($A_0^c$), the final alert is positive ($A_m$) if it is inverted, so $P(A_m | A_0^c, D) = m$.\nSubstituting these along with the definitions of $Se$ and $FNR$:\n$$ Se_m = (1-m) P(A_0 | D) + m P(A_0^c | D) = (1-m)Se + m(1-Se) $$\n\nSimilarly, the effective false positive rate, $FPR_m = P(A_m | D^c)$, is:\n$$ FPR_m = P(A_m | D^c) = P(A_m | A_0, D^c) P(A_0 | D^c) + P(A_m | A_0^c, D^c) P(A_0^c | D^c) $$\nUsing the same logic for the inversion probabilities:\n$$ FPR_m = (1-m) P(A_0 | D^c) + m P(A_0^c | D^c) = (1-m)(1-Sp) + m(Sp) $$\n\nNow we can write the general formula for $\\text{PPV}_m$:\n$$ \\text{PPV}_m = \\frac{p \\cdot Se_m}{p \\cdot Se_m + (1-p) \\cdot FPR_m} = \\frac{p \\cdot [Se(1-m) + m(1-Se)]}{p \\cdot [Se(1-m) + m(1-Se)] + (1-p) \\cdot [(1-Sp)(1-m) + m \\cdot Sp]} $$\n\nStep 1: Calculate $\\text{PPV}_0$ (for $m=0$).\nFor $m=0$, the general formula simplifies to the standard PPV formula:\n$$ \\text{PPV}_0 = \\frac{p \\cdot Se}{p \\cdot Se + (1-p)(1-Sp)} $$\nSubstituting the given values $p=0.10$, $Se=0.85$, and $Sp=0.95$:\n$$ \\text{PPV}_0 = \\frac{0.10 \\times 0.85}{(0.10 \\times 0.85) + (1-0.10)(1-0.95)} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV}_0 = \\frac{0.085}{0.085 + (0.90)(0.05)} = \\frac{0.085}{0.085 + 0.045} = \\frac{0.085}{0.130} \\approx 0.653846 $$\n\nStep 2: Calculate $\\text{PPV}_{0.05}$ (for $m=0.05$).\nFirst, we calculate the effective sensitivity $Se_{0.05}$ and effective false positive rate $FPR_{0.05}$ for $m=0.05$:\n$$ Se_{0.05} = (1-0.05)(0.85) + (0.05)(1-0.85) = (0.95)(0.85) + (0.05)(0.15) = 0.8075 + 0.0075 = 0.815 $$\n$$ FPR_{0.05} = (1-0.05)(1-0.95) + (0.05)(0.95) = (0.95)(0.05) + (0.05)(0.95) = 0.0475 + 0.0475 = 0.095 $$\nNow, we use these to calculate $\\text{PPV}_{0.05}$:\n$$ \\text{PPV}_{0.05} = \\frac{p \\cdot Se_{0.05}}{p \\cdot Se_{0.05} + (1-p) \\cdot FPR_{0.05}} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV}_{0.05} = \\frac{0.10 \\times 0.815}{(0.10 \\times 0.815) + (0.90 \\times 0.095)} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV}_{0.05} = \\frac{0.0815}{0.0815 + 0.0855} = \\frac{0.0815}{0.1670} \\approx 0.488024 $$\n\nStep 3: Compute the impact.\nThe impact is defined as the change in PPV from the ideal state to the error-prone state:\n$$ \\text{Impact} = \\text{PPV}_{0.05} - \\text{PPV}_0 $$\n$$ \\text{Impact} \\approx 0.488024 - 0.653846 = -0.165822 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the impact is $-0.1658$.

The values are physically and contextually reasonable. The problem is not scientifically unsound, incomplete, contradictory, or subjective. It is a well-posed problem that can be formalized and solved using principles of applied probability.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed.\n\nThe solution is a two-part calculation. First, we compute the base expected time saved ($S_{\\mathrm{base}}$) by comparing the expected time to complete a free-text order versus a structured order. Second, we compute the net utility, which weights the calculated savings and costs by their respective probabilities of occurrence.\n\nThe expected time to complete an order is the sum of the time for the primary actions (typing, clicking) and the expected time for error correction. The expected time for error correction is the product of the error probability and the duration of correction.\n\nLet $E[T_{\\mathrm{t}}]$ be the expected time for a free-text order. It is given by:\n$$E[T_{\\mathrm{t}}] = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{t}}}{v} + p_{\\mathrm{t}}d_{\\mathrm{t}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$E[T_{\\mathrm{t}}] = \\frac{160}{220} \\, \\text{min} + (0.10)(0.60) \\, \\text{min}$$\n$$E[T_{\\mathrm{t}}] = \\frac{8}{11} \\, \\text{min} + 0.06 \\, \\text{min} \\approx 0.72727... \\, \\text{min} + 0.06 \\, \\text{min} = 0.787272... \\, \\text{min}$$\n\nLet $E[T_{\\mathrm{s}}]$ be the expected time for a structured order. It is the sum of the expected time for typing, clicking, and error correction. First, we must ensure all units are consistent.

This requires the probability that all five rights are satisfied. Let this event be $A$.
