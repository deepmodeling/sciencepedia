The SCD for a simple, single-ingredient product includes exactly one Ingredient (IN), one Strength per unit, and one Dose Form, represented canonically as “Ingredient $+$ Strength $+$ Dose Form.”\n2.

By breaking down a multi-ingredient label and verifying its consistency, you will learn a critical process for ensuring data accuracy in clinical systems.", "problem": "A health system is harmonizing medication records using RxNorm, a standardized clinical drug vocabulary. The objective is to normalize a combination oral liquid product label to RxNorm concept types and verify internal consistency. The following core definitions apply: Semantic Clinical Drug Component (SCDC) represents a single ingredient with a quantitative strength and a dose form; Semantic Clinical Drug (SCD) represents a clinically meaningful product concept combining one or more SCDC entries with a single dose form and precise strengths; Multiple Ingredient (MIN) represents the unordered set of ingredients regardless of their strengths. For oral liquids, the normalized SCDC strength is specified per the canonical unit volume, which for this exercise is $1$ mL. Use the fundamental relationship that concentration equals amount divided by volume: if an ingredient has amount $a$ in milligrams over a volume $v$ in milliliters, then its concentration is $c = a / v$ in milligrams per milliliter.\n\nYou are given this combination product label as recorded in a hospital formulary: “Acetaminophen $160$ mg per $5$ mL; Diphenhydramine hydrochloride $12.5$ mg per $5$ mL; Oral Suspension.” Assume the preparation is uniform and the labeled strengths are exact with respect to the dispensed $5$ mL oral dosing volume. \n\nTasks:\n1.

There are no contradictions, missing information, or factual errors. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires a four-part analysis of a medication label using the provided RxNorm-based definitions. We will address each task sequentially.\n\n**Task 1: Decompose the label into Semantic Clinical Drug Component (SCDC) entries.**\nAn SCDC represents a single ingredient with a strength normalized to a canonical unit volume, which is specified as $1\\,\\text{mL}$. The dose form is \"Oral Suspension.\" We use the relationship that concentration $c$ (in mg/mL) is equal to amount $a$ (in mg) divided by volume $v$ (in mL).\n\nFor the first ingredient, Acetaminophen, the label provides an amount $a_1 = 160\\,\\text{mg}$ in a volume of $v = 5\\,\\text{mL}$. The normalized concentration, $c_1$, which corresponds to the SCDC strength, is calculated as:\n$$c_1 = \\frac{a_1}{v} = \\frac{160}{5} = 32\\,\\text{mg/mL}$$\nTherefore, the first SCDC is {Acetaminophen, $32\\,\\text{mg/mL}$ strength, Oral Suspension dose form}.\n\nFor the second ingredient, Diphenhydramine hydrochloride, the label provides an amount $a_2 = 12.5\\,\\text{mg}$ in the same volume of $v = 5\\,\\text{mL}$. The normalized concentration, $c_2$, is:\n$$c_2 = \\frac{a_2}{v} = \\frac{12.5}{5} = 2.5\\,\\text{mg/mL}$$\nTherefore, the second SCDC is {Diphenhydramine hydrochloride, $2.5\\,\\text{mg/mL}$ strength, Oral Suspension dose form}.\n\n**Task 2: Identify the Multiple Ingredient (MIN) concept.**\nThe MIN concept is defined as the unordered set of ingredients, ignoring any salt forms. The ingredients given are Acetaminophen and Diphenhydramine hydrochloride. To obtain the MIN, we identify the base ingredients. Acetaminophen has no salt form listed. For Diphenhydramine hydrochloride, the base ingredient is Diphenhydramine.\nThe resulting MIN is the set {Acetaminophen, Diphenhydramine}.\n\n**Task 3: Recombine the SCDC entries to form the Semantic Clinical Drug (SCD) concept.**\nThe SCD concept represents the clinically dispensed product, which has a volume of $5\\,\\text{mL}$. To reconstruct the SCD strengths, we must scale the normalized SCDC strengths (per $1\\,\\text{mL}$) back to the dispensed volume.

Let $S_{L,i}$ denote the label-stated strength and $S_{R,i}$ denote the recombined strength for ingredient $i$.\n\nThe formula is given by:\n$$C = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |S_{L,i} - S_{R,i}|$$\nwhere $n=2$ for the two ingredients in the product.\n\nFor the first ingredient, Acetaminophen ($i=1$):\nThe label-stated strength is $S_{L,1} = 160\\,\\text{mg}$.\nThe recombined strength from Task 3 is $S_{R,1} = a'_1 = 160\\,\\text{mg}$.\nThe absolute difference is $|160\\,\\text{mg} - 160\\,\\text{mg}| = 0\\,\\text{mg}$.\n\nFor the second ingredient, Diphenhydramine hydrochloride ($i=2$):\nThe label-stated strength is $S_{L,2} = 12.5\\,\\text{mg}$.\nThe recombined strength from Task 3 is $S_{R,2} = a'_2 = 12.5\\,\\text{mg}$.\nThe absolute difference is $|12.5\\,\\text{mg} - 12.5\\,\\text{mg}| = 0\\,\\text{mg}$.\n\nSumming these differences gives the value of the consistency scalar $C$:\n$$C = |160 - 160| + |12.5 - 12.5| = 0 + 0 = 0$$\nThe final value of the consistency scalar $C$ is $0\\,\\text{mg}$, which indicates that the normalization and recombination process is internally consistent and perfectly reconstructs the original label.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "4855494"}, {"introduction": "A primary strength of RxNorm is its ability to group medications for large-scale analysis and clinical decision support.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of medical informatics, specifically the RxNorm terminology standard. It is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and data for a unique solution. The language is objective and the tasks are formalizable.\n\nLet the set of all Semantic Clinical Drugs be denoted by $\\mathcal{S}$ and the set of all Semantic Clinical Drug Forms be denoted by $\\mathcal{F}$. According to the provided definition, an SCD is a tuple $s = (I, T, D)$, where $I$ is the set of active ingredients, $T$ is the strength specification, and $D$ is the dose form. Similarly, an SCDF is a tuple $f = (I, D)$.\n\nTask $1$: Define the mapping function and apply it.\n\nLet an arbitrary SCD be $s = (I, T, D) \\in \\mathcal{S}$. The mapping function $f$ abstracts away the strength, which is the second component of the tuple. Therefore, the function $f: \\mathcal{S} \\to \\mathcal{F}$ is a projection defined as:\n$$f((I, T, D)) = (I, D)$$\nThis function takes an SCD as input and returns a new tuple containing only the ingredient set $I$ and the dose form $D$, which is, by definition, the corresponding SCDF.\n\nNow, we apply this function to the specific SCD “Amoxicillin $250\\,\\mathrm{mg}/5\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ Oral Suspension”.\nFor this SCD, we can identify the components of its tuple representation:\n- Ingredient set: $I = \\{\\text{Amoxicillin}\\}$\n- Strength: $T = 250\\,\\mathrm{mg}/5\\,\\mathrm{mL}$\n- Dose Form: $D = \\text{Oral Suspension}$\n\nThe SCD can be formally written as the tuple $s_{amox} = (\\{\\text{Amoxicillin}\\}, 250\\,\\mathrm{mg}/5\\,\\mathrm{mL}, \\text{Oral Suspension})$.\nApplying the function $f$ to $s_{amox}$:\n$$f(s_{amox}) = f((\\{\\text{Amoxicillin}\\}, 250\\,\\mathrm{mg}/5\\,\\mathrm{mL}, \\text{Oral Suspension})) = (\\{\\text{Amoxicillin}\\}, \\text{Oral Suspension})$$\nThe resulting SCDF is the tuple $(\\{\\text{Amoxicillin}\\}, \\text{Oral Suspension})$, which corresponds to the name “Amoxicillin Oral Suspension”.\n\nThe construction preserves the ingredient set ($\\{\\text{Amoxicillin}\\}$) and the dose form ($\\text{Oral Suspension}$) by including them as the components of the output tuple.

Two SCDs, $s_1 = (I_1, T_1, D_1)$ and $s_2 = (I_2, T_2, D_2)$, map to the same SCDF if and only if $f(s_1) = f(s_2)$, which means $(I_1, D_1) = (I_2, D_2)$. This occurs when both SCDs are chosen from the same medication group (i.e., they share the same ingredient set and dose form).\n\nLet us denote the number of SCDs in each of the $k=6$ medication groups as $n_i$ for $i=1, \\dots, 6$.\n- $n_1 = 3$ (Metformin Oral Tablet)\n- $n_2 = 5$ (Lisinopril Oral Tablet)\n- $n_3 = 2$ (Acetaminophen $+$ Hydrocodone Oral Tablet)\n- $n_4 = 2$ (Albuterol Inhalation Solution)\n- $n_5 = 3$ (Amoxicillin Oral Suspension)\n- $n_6 = 3$ (Morphine Extended Release Oral Capsule)\n\nThe number of ways to choose $2$ SCDs from the $i$-th group is $\\binom{n_i}{2}$.

Both are divisible by $3$:\n$$21 = 3 \\times 7$$\n$$153 = 3 \\times 51$$\nThus, the simplified probability is:\n$$P = \\frac{7}{51}$$\nSince $7$ is a prime number and $51 = 3 \\times 17$, the fraction is irreducible.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{7}{51}}$$", "id": "4855410"}]}
