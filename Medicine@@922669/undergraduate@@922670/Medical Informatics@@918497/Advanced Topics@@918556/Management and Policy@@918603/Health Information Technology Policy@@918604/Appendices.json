A standard method to convert a set of positive priority values $\\{a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_N\\}$ into a set of weights that sum to $1$ is to normalize them by their total sum. Thus, the weight for measure $i$ is given by:\n$$\nw_i = \\frac{a_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} a_j}\n$$\nThe normalized score $m_i$ for each measure is given by the linear transformation capped at the $[0, 1]$ interval:\n$$\nm_i = \\max\\!\\Big(0, \\min\\!\\Big(1, \\frac{p_i - L_i}{U_i - L_i}\\Big)\\Big)\n$$\nwhere $p_i$ is the raw performance rate, $L_i$ is the floor, and $U_i$ is the benchmark.\n\nCombining these expressions, the complete formula for the composite score $S$ is:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left(\\frac{a_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} a_j}\\right) \\max\\!\\Big(0, \\min\\!\\Big(1, \\frac{p_i - L_i}{U_i - L_i}\\Big)\\Big)\n$$\nThis expression is consistent with all the axioms and definitions provided.\n\n#### Task 2: Computation of the Hospital's Composite Score\n\nThe computation involves three steps: calculating the normalized score for each of the four measures, calculating the weight for each measure, and finally calculating the weighted sum.\n\n**Step 2a: Calculate Normalized Scores ($m_i$)**\n\nFor each measure, we apply the normalization formula.\n\n1.  **Patient Access (PA)**:\n    $p_{\\mathrm{PA}} = 0.76$, $L_{\\mathrm{PA}} = 0.50$, $U_{\\mathrm{PA}} = 0.90$.\n    The normalized term is $\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{PA}} - L_{\\mathrm{PA}}}{U_{\\mathrm{PA}} - L_{\\mathrm{PA}}} = \\frac{0.76 - 0.50}{0.90 - 0.50} = \\frac{0.26}{0.40} = 0.65$.\n    Since $0 \\le 0.65 \\le 1$, $m_{\\mathrm{PA}} = 0.65$.\n\n2.  **Electronic Prescribing (eRx)**:\n    $p_{\\mathrm{eRx}} = 0.88$, $L_{\\mathrm{eRx}} = 0.70$, $U_{\\mathrm{eRx}} = 0.95$.\n    The normalized term is $\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{eRx}} - L_{\\mathrm{eRx}}}{U_{\\mathrm{eRx}} - L_{\\mathrm{eRx}}} = \\frac{0.88 - 0.70}{0.95 - 0.70} = \\frac{0.18}{0.25} = 0.72$.\n    Since $0 \\le 0.72 \\le 1$, $m_{\\mathrm{eRx}} = 0.72$.\n\n3.  **Health Information Exchange (HIE)**:\n    $p_{\\mathrm{HIE}} = 0.51$, $L_{\\mathrm{HIE}} = 0.40$, $U_{\\mathrm{HIE}} = 0.85$.\n    The normalized term is $\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{HIE}} - L_{\\mathrm{HIE}}}{U_{\\mathrm{HIE}} - L_{\\mathrm{HIE}}} = \\frac{0.51 - 0.40}{0.85 - 0.40} = \\frac{0.11}{0.45} = \\frac{11}{45}$.\n    As a decimal, this is approximately $0.2444\\ldots$.

The QHIN nodes are themselves fully interconnected with a direct edge between $q_1$ and $q_2$. Every organization in HIE-1 and HIE-2 connects to $q_1$ with a direct edge, and every organization in HIE-3 connects to $q_2$ with a direct edge. Let $G_1$ be the resulting undirected graph with vertex set $V_1 = V_0 \\cup \\{q_1, q_2\\}$. For reachability analysis, a pair of organizations is considered reachable if there exists at least one path connecting them in the graph; paths may traverse QHIN nodes.\n\nLet the reachability metric be defined as the count of unordered pairs of distinct organizations in $V_0$ that are connected by some path in the graph.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires the computation of a ratio $R$, which quantifies the improvement in reachability among a set of $12$ health care organizations after the introduction of a QHIN-based framework. Let $N_0$ be the number of reachable pairs of organizations in the initial graph $G_0$, and let $N_1$ be the number of a reachable pairs of organizations in the final graph $G_1$. The ratio is $R = \\frac{N_1}{N_0}$.\n\n**1. Analysis of the pre-TEFCA graph $G_0$**\n\nThe initial set of organizations, $V_0$, has a total of $|V_0| = 12$ vertices. These are partitioned into three subsets corresponding to the HIEs: $V_{H1}$, $V_{H2}$, and $V_{H3}$, with sizes $|V_{H1}| = n_1 = 5$, $|V_{H2}| = n_2 = 4$, and $|V_{H3}| = n_3 = 3$.\n\nIn the graph $G_0$, connections exist only between organizations within the same HIE. Each HIE is described as having connections between every pair of its member organizations, which means each HIE forms a complete graph (a clique). Let these be $K_5$, $K_4$, and $K_3$. Since there are no inter-HIE edges, the graph $G_0$ is the disjoint union of these three complete graphs: $G_0 = K_5 \\cup K_4 \\cup K_3$.\n\nTwo organizations in $G_0$ are reachable if and only if they belong to the same HIE. Therefore, the number of reachable pairs, $N_0$, is the sum of the number of pairs within each HIE. The number of unordered pairs in a set of $n$ items is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\n\n-   Number of reachable pairs in HIE-1: $\\binom{n_1}{2} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5(4)}{2} = 10$.\n-   Number of reachable pairs in HIE-2: $\\binom{n_2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4(3)}{2} = 6$.\n-   Number of reachable pairs in HIE-3: $\\binom{n_3}{2} = \\binom{3}{2} = \\frac{3(2)}{2} = 3$.\n\nThe total number of reachable pairs in $G_0$ is the sum of these values:\n$$\nN_0 = \\binom{5}{2} + \\binom{4}{2} + \\binom{3}{2} = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19\n$$\n\n**2. Analysis of the post-TEFCA graph $G_1$**\n\nThe graph $G_1$ is formed by adding two QHIN nodes, $q_1$ and $q_2$, to $V_0$. The edge structure is modified as follows:\n-   An edge connects $q_1$ and $q_2$.\n-   All organizations in HIE-1 and HIE-2 ($V_{H1} \\cup V_{H2}$) are connected to $q_1$.\n-   All organizations in HIE-3 ($V_{H3}$) are connected to $q_2$.\n\nWe need to determine the number of pairs of organizations in $V_0$ that are reachable in $G_1$. Let $u, v$ be any two distinct organizations in $V_0$.\n-   Any organization $o \\in V_{H1} \\cup V_{H2}$ has a path to $q_1$.\n-   Any organization $o' \\in V_{H3}$ has a path to $q_2$.\n-   Since $q_1$ and $q_2$ are connected, there is a path between any organization connected to $q_1$ and any organization connected to $q_2$. For instance, for $u \\in V_{H1}$ and $v \\in V_{H3}$, the path $u - q_1 - q_2 - v$ exists, so they are reachable.\n-   Similarly, any two organizations in $V_{H1} \\cup V_{H2}$ are reachable via $q_1$. For instance, for $u \\in V_{H1}$ and $v \\in V_{H2}$, the path $u-q_1-v$ exists.\n-   Pairs within the same HIE remain reachable as they were in $G_0$.\n\nThis new structure ensures that a path exists between any arbitrary pair of distinct organizations in $V_0$. Consequently, the entire set of $12$ organizations in $V_0$ forms a single connected component in terms of reachability in the context of $G_1$.\n\nThe number of reachable pairs of organizations in $G_1$, $N_1$, is therefore the total number of unordered pairs of distinct organizations that can be formed from the $12$ organizations in $V_0$.\n$$\nN_1 = \\binom{|V_0|}{2} = \\binom{12}{2} = \\frac{12(11)}{2} = 66\n$$\n\n**3. Calculation of the Reachability Improvement Ratio $R$**\n\nThe multiplicative improvement in reachability is the ratio $R = \\frac{N_1}{N_0}$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{66}{19}\n$$\nThe number $19$ is a prime number, and $66$ is not a multiple of $19$. Therefore, the fraction is in its simplest form.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{66}{19}}$$", "id": "4842161"}]}
