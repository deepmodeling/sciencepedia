The initiative includes a structured training program designed to improve clinicians’ Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU), a construct from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Adoption intent is measured by Behavioral Intention (BI), and perceived benefit is measured by Perceived Usefulness (PU). All three constructs—Behavioral Intention (BI), Perceived Usefulness (PU), and Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU)—are standardized prior to modeling, each transformed to have mean $0$ and standard deviation $1$.\n\nAssume the hospital’s informatics team has estimated a linear model linking adoption intent to these constructs, with a disturbance term $\\epsilon$ representing unmodeled influences:\n$$BI = 0.3\\,PU + 0.4\\,PEOU + \\epsilon.$$\nThe training program is expected to increase the mean of $PEOU$ by $0.5$ standard deviations relative to its pre-training mean (that is, $PEOU$ shifts by $+0.5$ in its standardized units). For the evaluation horizon of interest, assume the training does not directly alter the mean of $PU$ and the disturbance term has mean zero, that is, $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon] = 0$.\n\nUsing fundamental properties of expectation and linear models, compute the expected change in Behavioral Intention (BI) attributable to the training.

The relationship between $BI$ and its predictors, Perceived Usefulness ($PU$) and Perceived Ease of Use ($PEOU$), is given by the linear model:\n$$BI = 0.3\\,PU + 0.4\\,PEOU + \\epsilon$$\nHere, $\\epsilon$ is a disturbance term with an expected value of zero, $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon] = 0$.\n\nThe constructs $BI$, $PU$, and $PEOU$ are all standardized variables. This means that prior to any intervention, their means are $0$ and their standard deviations are $1$. Let us denote the state before the training with the subscript 'pre' and the state after the training with the subscript 'post'.\n\nThe expected value of a random variable is a linear operator. Applying the expectation operator to the linear model, we obtain the expected value of $BI$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[BI] = \\mathbb{E}[0.3\\,PU + 0.4\\,PEOU + \\epsilon]$$\nUsing the linearity property of expectation, $\\mathbb{E}[aX + bY] = a\\mathbb{E}[X] + b\\mathbb{E}[Y]$, we can write:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[BI] = 0.3\\,\\mathbb{E}[PU] + 0.4\\,\\mathbb{E}[PEOU] + \\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon]$$\n\nBefore the training intervention, the expected values of the standardized predictors are:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[PU_{pre}] = 0$$\n$$\\mathbb{E}[PEOU_{pre}] = 0$$\nGiven that $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon] = 0$, the expected value of $BI$ before the training is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[BI_{pre}] = 0.3\\,\\mathbb{E}[PU_{pre}] + 0.4\\,\\mathbb{E}[PEOU_{pre}] + \\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon]$$\n$$\\mathbb{E}[BI_{pre}] = 0.3(0) + 0.4(0) + 0 = 0$$\nThis is consistent with the fact that $BI$ is also a standardized variable with a pre-intervention mean of $0$.\n\nAfter the training intervention, the means of the predictor variables may change. The problem states:\n1. The training does not directly alter the mean of $PU$. Therefore, the expected value of $PU$ after the training remains the same:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[PU_{post}] = \\mathbb{E}[PU_{pre}] = 0$$\n2. The training program increases the mean of $PEOU$ by $0.5$ standard deviations.
