In this clinical authentication setting, assume the allowed alphabet consists of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits.

The derivation must proceed from first principles.\n\n**Problem Formulation**\nLet $C$ be the length of the password, and let $A$ be the size of the alphabet from which characters are chosen.\nThe problem states that each of the $C$ characters in the password is chosen independently and uniformly from the alphabet of size $A$.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Password length, $C = 10$.\n- Alphabet size, $A = 62$. This is composed of $26$ uppercase letters, $26$ lowercase letters, and $10$ digits.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Expected Single-Guess Success Probability**\n\nThe set of all possible passwords forms the sample space, which we shall denote by $S$. Since each of the $C$ positions in the password can be filled by any of the $A$ characters independently, the total number of unique passwords is the size of the sample space, $|S|$. By the multiplicative principle of counting, this is:\n$$|S| = A \\times A \\times \\cdots \\times A \\text{ ($C$ times)} = A^C$$\n\nThe problem states that the password generator is \"cryptographically secure\" and ensures \"uniform randomness\". This implies that every password in the sample space $S$ is equally likely to be assigned to a user. This establishes a finite equiprobable sample space. The probability of any specific password, $p_i \\in S$, being the correct one is:\n$$P(p_i) = \\frac{1}{|S|} = \\frac{1}{A^C}$$\n\nAn online adversary makes a \"single blind guess\". This means the adversary chooses one password from the entire space of possibilities and tests it. The success of this guess depends on whether the chosen password matches the user's assigned password. Since the user's password is a uniformly random selection from $S$, the probability that the adversary's single guess is correct is precisely the probability of any individual password in the space. Let $P_{\\text{success}}$ denote this probability.\n$$P_{\\text{success}} = \\frac{1}{|S|} = \\frac{1}{A^C} = A^{-C}$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Password Entropy**\n\nThe Shannon entropy, $H(X)$, of a discrete random variable $X$ with a set of possible outcomes $\\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_N\\}$ and a probability mass function $p(x_i) = P(X=x_i)$ is defined as:\n$$H(X) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{N} p(x_i) \\log_b(p(x_i))$$\nFor the result to be in bits, the base of the logarithm, $b$, must be $2$.\n\nIn this problem, the random variable $X$ represents the password. The number of possible outcomes is $N = |S| = A^C$. The probability distribution is uniform, so the probability for any single password $x_i$ is:\n$$p(x_i) = \\frac{1}{A^C}$$\nSubstituting this into the entropy formula:\n$$H(X) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{A^C} \\left(\\frac{1}{A^C}\\right) \\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{A^C}\\right)$$\nThe term inside the summation is a constant, so we can replace the sum with a multiplication by the number of terms, $A^C$:\n$$H(X) = -A^C \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{A^C}\\right) \\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{A^C}\\right)$$\n$$H(X) = -\\log_2\\left(A^{-C}\\right)$$\nUsing the logarithm power rule, $\\log(x^y) = y \\log(x)$:\n$$H(X) = -(-C \\log_2(A)) = C \\log_2(A)$$\nThis expression gives the Shannon entropy of the password in bits.\n\n**3. Numerical Evaluation**\n\nThe problem provides the specific parameters $A=62$ and $C=10$. We substitute these values into the derived expressions.\n\n- **Expected Single-Guess Success Probability:**\n$$P_{\\text{success}} = A^{-C} = 62^{-10}$$\nTo evaluate this, we compute:\n$$P_{\\text{success}} = \\frac{1}{62^{10}} = \\frac{1}{839299365868340224}$$\n$$P_{\\text{success}} \\approx 1.19149216 \\times 10^{-18}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required:\n$$P_{\\text{success}} \\approx 1.191 \\times 10^{-18}$$\n\n- **Password Entropy in bits:**\n$$H = C \\log_2(A) = 10 \\log_2(62)$$\nTo calculate the base-$2$ logarithm, we can use the change of base formula, $\\log_b(x) = \\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(b)}$:\n$$H = 10 \\frac{\\ln(62)}{\\ln(2)}$$\nUsing the values $\\ln(62) \\approx 4.127134385$ and $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147180$:\n$$H \\approx 10 \\times \\frac{4.127134385}{0.693147180} \\approx 10 \\times 5.95419631$$\n$$H \\approx 59.5419631 \\text{ bits}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required:\n$$H \\approx 59.54 \\text{ bits}$$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1.191 \\times 10^{-18} & 59.54 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4823140"}, {"introduction": "After a clinician is authenticated, their access rights are governed by their assigned role.
