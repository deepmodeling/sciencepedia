It is therefore deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n#### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to find the expected size of an equivalence class for a randomly selected record. An equivalence class is the set of all records sharing the same quasi-identifier (QI).\n\nFirst, we determine the size of the space of all possible quasi-identifiers. The QI is a tuple of three independent attributes.\n-   Number of distinct values for year of birth: $D_Y = 100$.\n-   Number of distinct values for sex: $D_S = 2$.\n-   Number of distinct values for the three-digit ZIP prefix: $D_Z = 1{,}000$.\n\nSince the attributes are independent, the total number of unique QIs, denoted by $M$, is the product of the number of values for each attribute:\n$$M = D_Y \\times D_S \\times D_Z = 100 \\times 2 \\times 1{,}000 = 200{,}000$$\n\nThe problem states that each attribute is uniformly distributed. Due to their independence, any specific QI tuple from the space of all possible QIs is equally likely. The probability, $p$, of a randomly generated record having any specific QI is:\n$$p = \\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{1}{200{,}000}$$\n\nLet the $N$ records in the dataset be denoted by $R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_N$. The total number of records is $N = 10{,}000$. Let $QI(R_i)$ be the quasi-identifier for record $R_i$.\n\nWe wish to find the expected size of the equivalence class of a randomly selected record. Due to the assumption that all records are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.), we can simplify the problem by considering the expected size of the equivalence class for a specific record, say $R_1$, without loss of generality. Let $K_1$ be the size of the equivalence class containing record $R_1$.\n\nThe size $K_1$ is the number of records in the dataset (including $R_1$ itself) that have the same QI as $R_1$. We can express $K_1$ using indicator functions:\n$$K_1 = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} I(QI(R_j) = QI(R_1))$$\nwhere $I(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function, which equals $1$ if its argument is true and $0$ otherwise.\n\nWe are asked to find the expected size, $E[K_1]$. Using the linearity of expectation, we have:\n$$E[K_1] = E\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{N} I(QI(R_j) = QI(R_1))\\right] = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} E[I(QI(R_j) = QI(R_1))]$$\n\nThe expectation of an indicator function is the probability of the event it indicates:\n$$E[I(QI(R_j) = QI(R_1))] = P(QI(R_j) = QI(R_1))$$\nWe must evaluate this probability for two distinct cases.\n\n**Case 1: $j=1$**\nThe term is $P(QI(R_1) = QI(R_1))$. This is a certain event, so its probability is $1$.\n\n**Case 2: $j \\neq 1$**\nHere we need to find the probability that the QI of record $R_j$ matches the QI of record $R_1$. Since the records are generated independently, the value of $QI(R_1)$ does not affect the value of $QI(R_j)$.\nLet's condition on the value of $QI(R_1)$. Let $QI(R_1) = q$, where $q$ is some specific QI value. Since $R_j$ is generated independently, the probability that $QI(R_j)$ takes on this same value $q$ is $p = 1/M$. This reasoning holds for any specific value $q$ that $QI(R_1)$ might take.\nFormally, we can write:\n$$P(QI(R_j) = QI(R_1)) = \\sum_{q \\in \\mathcal{Q}} P(QI(R_j) = q \\text{ and } QI(R_1) = q)$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{Q}$ is the set of all possible QIs. Due to independence of the records:\n$$P(QI(R_j) = QI(R_1)) = \\sum_{q \\in \\mathcal{Q}} P(QI(R_j) = q) P(QI(R_1) = q)$$\nAs established, for any $q$, $P(QI(R_j)=q) = 1/M$ and $P(QI(R_1)=q) = 1/M$.\n$$P(QI(R_j) = QI(R_1)) = \\sum_{q \\in \\mathcal{Q}} \\left(\\frac{1}{M}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{M}\\right) = |\\mathcal{Q}| \\times \\frac{1}{M^2} = M \\times \\frac{1}{M^2} = \\frac{1}{M}$$\nSo, for any $j \\neq 1$, the probability of a QI match is $1/M$.\n\nNow, we can assemble the expectation $E[K_1]$. The sum $\\sum_{j=1}^{N}$ has one term where $j=1$ and $N-1$ terms where $j \\neq 1$.\n$$E[K_1] = P(QI(R_1) = QI(R_1)) + \\sum_{j=2}^{N} P(QI(R_j) = QI(R_1))$$\n$$E[K_1] = 1 + \\sum_{j=2}^{N} \\frac{1}{M}$$\nThe summation has $N-1$ identical terms.\n$$E[K_1] = 1 + (N-1) \\frac{1}{M}$$\n\nNow we substitute the numerical values for $N$ and $M$:\n-   $N = 10{,}000$\n-   $M = 200{,}000$\n\n$$E[K_1] = 1 + \\frac{10{,}000 - 1}{200{,}000} = 1 + \\frac{9{,}999}{200{,}000}$$\nTo express this as a single value, we compute the fraction:\n$$\\frac{9{,}999}{200{,}000} = 0.049995$$\nThis division is exact. Therefore, the expected size of the equivalence class is:\n$$E[K_1] = 1 + 0.049995 = 1.049995$$\nThis is the final exact value.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.049995}$$", "id": "4834279"}, {"introduction": "Meeting a privacy standard like $l$-diversity is an important step, but it does not guarantee perfect privacy.

The first five significant figures are $7, 2, 6, 7, 2$.
