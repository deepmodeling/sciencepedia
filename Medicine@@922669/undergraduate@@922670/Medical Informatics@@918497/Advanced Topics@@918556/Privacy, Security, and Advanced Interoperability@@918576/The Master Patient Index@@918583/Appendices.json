The consequences for patient safety, billing, and legal documentation are significant. This problem presents a realistic post-discharge overlay scenario, challenging you to devise a remediation plan that corrects the error while adhering to the strict principles of legal medical record immutability, audit trail integrity, and revenue cycle compliance [@problem_id:4861551].", "problem": "A hospital uses a Master Patient Index (MPI) to ensure each person has a single, unique identity across systems. An MPI overlay is defined as the erroneous consolidation of clinical and demographic data from two distinct individuals into a single identity, which can cause incorrect clinical documentation and billing attribution. The legal medical record principle of immutability states that once a clinical entry is finalized, it cannot be deleted or altered; corrections must be handled through documented amendments that preserve the original content, authorship, and timestamps, supported by an audit trail. The Health Information Management (HIM) discipline treats identity corrections as a record-segmentation activity in which provenance and audit integrity must be preserved. Consider the following scenario. Two patients, denoted $P_A$ and $P_B$, with similar names and dates of birth, were overlaid during registration, causing $P_B$’s admission encounter to be appended under $P_A$’s medical record number (MRN) $M_X$. Post-discharge, the organization discovers the overlay when $P_A$ queries an explanation of benefits that shows services not received by $P_A$. The hospital has already submitted a claim for the discharge under $M_X$ and the inpatient electronic health record (EHR) contains provider notes, orders, diagnostic results, and coded diagnoses and procedures for the erroneous attribution. The organization must remediate clinical documentation and billing while preserving the legal medical record, notify affected downstream systems, and prevent recurrence. Starting from the core definitions and principles above, which option best describes a scientifically sound and legally compliant sequence of steps to remediate this post-discharge overlay and restore correct attribution?\n\nA. Immediately create a new MRN for $P_A$, move all historical data under the new MRN, delete the incorrect entries from the original record to avoid confusion, keep the submitted claim unchanged to reduce payer friction, and inform only internal departments to minimize external disclosures.\n\nB. Perform an MPI reverse-merge (overlay break) to re-segment the records, retain $M_X$ for the true identity to which most historical data properly belongs, assign a distinct MRN $M_Y$ for the misattributed patient $P_B$ if required, and use HIM-managed amendment workflows to add addenda that clarify original authorship, timestamps, and correct patient attribution without deleting entries. Reconcile encounter-level documentation by reassigning orders, results, and provider notes to the correct identity while preserving audit trails; update coding to reflect the correct patient and episode; retract the erroneous claim and resubmit a corrected claim under the correct MRN; notify the payer and any Health Information Exchange (HIE) and downstream systems with identity correction messages; perform root-cause analysis and implement registration controls to reduce the risk of future overlays.\n\nC. Merge both patients permanently into a single MRN to ensure continuity, document a brief disclaimer in the chart stating the identity issue, update the discharge summary to reflect both names, keep the original billing intact to avoid a compliance audit, and later run a batch job to fix any downstream mismatches.\n\nD. Hide the erroneous clinical entries using soft-delete flags so providers will not see them, overwrite the authorship and timestamps to match the correct patient, resubmit the claim with corrected demographics but without payer notification of a prior error, and refrain from sending identity updates to external HIEs to contain the issue within the organization.\n\nChoose the single best option that aligns with MPI identity management, legal medical record immutability and amendment, audit trail integrity, and compliant revenue cycle correction after a post-discharge overlay has been detected.", "solution": "The core definitions and principles form the basis of the remediation strategy. The Master Patient Index (MPI) is the system of record for unique patient identification. An overlay is when two distinct identities are erroneously combined under one identifier, leading to misattribution of clinical and financial events. The legal medical record is governed by immutability: finalized entries cannot be deleted or altered; corrections must be explicit amendments that preserve the original content, authorship, and timestamps, with an auditable provenance trail. Health Information Management (HIM) practice mandates that identity corrections be performed via segmentation and reassignment, not data destruction, and revenue cycle compliance requires retracting erroneous claims and resubmitting corrected ones under the correct identity, with payer notification. Downstream systems, including Health Information Exchange (HIE) participants, must receive identity correction messages to maintain alignment.\n\nFrom these principles, the remediation must satisfy several constraints: first, break the overlay by re-segmenting records so each individual has a distinct MRN; second, preserve the legal medical record by retaining all original entries and applying HIM-managed amendments and addenda, never deleting or overwriting; third, reassign encounter-level artifacts (orders, results, notes) to the correct identity while keeping the audit trail intact; fourth, correct coding and billing by retracting the erroneous claim and resubmitting under the correct MRN with payer communication; fifth, propagate identity corrections to downstream systems to maintain consistency; sixth, perform root-cause analysis and strengthen registration identity controls to prevent recurrence.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This option proposes immediately creating a new MRN for $P_A$, moving all historical data, deleting incorrect entries, keeping the submitted claim unchanged, and limiting disclosures to internal departments. Deleting incorrect entries violates the legal medical record immutability principle because finalized content cannot be removed; it must be corrected via amendment that preserves provenance. Keeping the submitted claim unchanged perpetuates erroneous billing attribution and is noncompliant with revenue cycle correction requirements. Limiting disclosures to internal departments ignores the necessity to notify payers and downstream systems to align identities. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nB. This option uses an MPI reverse-merge (overlay break) to re-segment records, retaining $M_X$ for the identity that correctly holds most historical data and assigning a distinct MRN $M_Y$ for $P_B$ if necessary, while applying HIM-managed amendment workflows to add addenda that clarify the misattribution, preserving authorship and timestamps. It specifies reassignment of orders, results, and notes to the correct identity with audit trail intact; updating coding; retracting the erroneous claim and resubmitting a corrected claim under the correct MRN; notifying the payer and downstream systems including HIEs; and performing root-cause analysis with registration controls. This sequence aligns with MPI identity management principles, legal medical record immutability, audit trail preservation, and compliant revenue cycle correction, as well as system-wide consistency. Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. This option proposes merging both patients permanently into a single MRN, documenting a disclaimer, updating the discharge summary to reflect both names, keeping original billing intact, and fixing downstream mismatches later. Permanently merging distinct identities violates MPI uniqueness and perpetuates misattribution; disclaimers do not satisfy amendment requirements nor correct the identity error. Keeping billing intact fails compliance, and postponing downstream corrections risks propagation of the error. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. This option suggests hiding erroneous entries via soft-delete, overwriting authorship and timestamps, resubmitting claims without payer notification of prior error, and avoiding HIE updates. Soft-delete and overwriting provenance violate legal medical record immutability and audit trail integrity. Failing to notify payers and HIEs undermines compliance and systemic identity alignment.
