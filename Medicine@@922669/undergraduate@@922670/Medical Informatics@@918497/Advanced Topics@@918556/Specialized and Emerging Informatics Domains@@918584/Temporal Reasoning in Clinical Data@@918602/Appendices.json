The infusion starts on the United States Eastern Time zone’s Daylight Saving Time (DST) fall-back day, when the offset transitions from Eastern Daylight Time (EDT, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) offset $-4$) to Eastern Standard Time (EST, UTC offset $-5$). The recorded start timestamp is $2024$-$11$-$03$ $01{:}30{:}00$ with offset $-04{:}00$, and the recorded end timestamp is $2024$-$11$-$03$ $02{:}45{:}00$ with offset $-05{:}00$.

The language is objective and precise.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities related to a continuous medication infusion that spans a DST fall-back transition: the true elapsed duration and the number of local-clock minutes that are double-counted by a naive aggregation method.\n\n**1. Calculation of the True Elapsed Duration ($\\Delta t_{\\text{true}}$)**\n\nThe true elapsed duration between two events is independent of local time zones and their conventions. It must be calculated in a uniform, absolute time frame, for which Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the standard.\n\nThe given timestamps are:\nStart timestamp, $T_{start}$: $2024$-$11$-$03$ $01{:}30{:}00$ with offset $-04{:}00$. This is Eastern Daylight Time (EDT).\nEnd timestamp, $T_{end}$: $2024$-$11$-$03$ $02{:}45{:}00$ with offset $-05{:}00$. This is Eastern Standard Time (EST).\n\nThe conversion from a local time with an offset to UTC is given by the formula:\n$$T_{UTC} = T_{local} - \\text{offset}$$\n\nFirst, we convert the start timestamp to UTC.\nThe local start time is $T_{start, local} = 01{:}30{:}00$.\nThe offset is $-04{:}00$ hours.\n$$T_{start, UTC} = 01{:}30{:}00 - (-04{:}00{:}00) = 01{:}30{:}00 + 04{:}00{:}00 = 05{:}30{:}00 \\text{ UTC}$$\n\nNext, we convert the end timestamp to UTC.\nThe local end time is $T_{end, local} = 02{:}45{:}00$.\nThe offset is $-05{:}00$ hours.\n$$T_{end, UTC} = 02{:}45{:}00 - (-05{:}00{:}00) = 02{:}45{:}00 + 05{:}00{:}00 = 07{:}45{:}00 \\text{ UTC}$$\n\nThe true elapsed duration, $\\Delta t_{\\text{true}}$, is the difference between the end and start times in UTC.\n$$\\Delta t_{\\text{true}} = T_{end, UTC} - T_{start, UTC}$$\n$$\\Delta t_{\\text{true}} = (07 \\text{ hours}, 45 \\text{ minutes}) - (05 \\text{ hours}, 30 \\text{ minutes})$$\n$$\\Delta t_{\\text{true}} = (7-5) \\text{ hours} + (45-30) \\text{ minutes} = 2 \\text{ hours} + 15 \\text{ minutes}$$\nTo express this duration solely in minutes:\n$$\\Delta t_{\\text{true}} = (2 \\times 60) \\text{ minutes} + 15 \\text{ minutes} = 120 + 15 = 135 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\n**2. Calculation of Double-Counted Minutes ($m_{\\text{double}}$)**\n\nThe DST fall-back on the specified date involves the local clock repeating the hour from $01{:}00{:}00$ to $01{:}59{:}59$.\nThe first occurrence of this hour is in EDT (offset $-04{:}00$).

Let's call this the \"EST pass\". In UTC, this interval is:\n`01:00:00-05:00` to `01:59:59-05:00` $\\implies$ `06:00:00 UTC` to `06:59:59 UTC`.\n\nA naive aggregation method that ignores the offset would double-count any local minute-label (e.g., `01:45`) that appears during the infusion in both the EDT pass and the EST pass. We must determine which minute labels of the `01:xx` hour are covered by the infusion in each pass.\n\nThe infusion runs from $T_{start, UTC} = 05{:}30{:}00$ UTC to $T_{end, UTC} = 07{:}45{:}00$ UTC.\n\nFor the EDT pass (`05:00:00` to `05:59:59` UTC):\nThe infusion starts at `05:30:00` UTC and continues through the end of this pass at `05:59:59` UTC.\nThe infusion covers the local time labels from `01:30` EDT to `01:59` EDT. Let $S_1$ be the set of minute-of-hour integers for this period.\n$$S_1 = \\{ m \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid 30 \\le m \\le 59 \\}$$\n\nFor the EST pass (`06:00:00` to `06:59:59` UTC):\nThe infusion runs from `05:30:00` UTC to `07:45:00` UTC. This interval completely contains the EST pass.\nTherefore, the infusion is active for the entire duration of the second pass, covering all local time labels from `01:00` EST to `01:59` EST. Let $S_2$ be the set of minute-of-hour integers for this period.\n$$S_2 = \\{ m \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid 0 \\le m \\le 59 \\}$$\n\nThe set of double-counted minute labels, $S_{double}$, is the set of local minute labels that appear in both passes during the infusion. This corresponds to the intersection of the sets $S_1$ and $S_2$.\n$$S_{double} = S_1 \\cap S_2 = \\{ m \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid 30 \\le m \\le 59 \\} \\cap \\{ m \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid 0 \\le m \\le 59 \\}$$\n$$S_{double} = \\{ m \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid 30 \\le m \\le 59 \\}$$\n\nThe number of double-counted minutes, $m_{\\text{double}}$, is the cardinality of this set.\n$$m_{\\text{double}} = |S_{double}| = 59 - 30 + 1 = 30$$\n\nThe two quantities are $\\Delta t_{\\text{true}} = 135$ minutes and $m_{\\text{double}} = 30$ minutes.

Patients who never receive treatment (Patients $4, 5$) form the \"unexposed\" group.\n\n- **Unexposed Group (Patients 4, 5)**:\n  - Events ($E_0^{\\text{naive}}$): The outcomes for Patient $4$ and Patient $5$ occurred while unexposed, so $E_0^{\\text{naive}} = 1+1=2$.\n  - Person-time ($PT_0^{\\text{naive}}$): Total follow-up time for Patients $4$ and $5$. $PT_0^{\\text{naive}} = 40 + 90 = 130$ days.\n\n- **Exposed Group (Patients 1, 2, 3, 6)**:\n  - Events ($E_1^{\\text{naive}}$): The outcomes for Patients $1, 2, 6$ are all counted as exposed events. So, $E_1^{\\text{naive}} = 1+1+1=3$.\n  - Person-time ($PT_1^{\\text{naive}}$): Total follow-up time for Patients $1, 2, 3, 6$. $PT_1^{\\text{naive}} = 70 (\\text{P1}) + 20 (\\text{P2}) + 100 (\\text{P3}) + 85 (\\text{P6}) = 275$ days.\n\nThe naive hazard ratio estimate is:\n$$ \\widehat{\\mathrm{HR}}_{\\text{naive}} = \\frac{E_1^{\\text{naive}} / PT_1^{\\text{naive}}}{E_0^{\\text{naive}} / PT_0^{\\text{naive}}} = \\frac{3 / 275}{2 / 130} = \\frac{3}{275} \\times \\frac{130}{2} = \\frac{390}{550} = \\frac{39}{55} $$\nThis naive approach introduces immortal time bias by misclassifying the unexposed person-time of eventually-treated individuals as exposed person-time, which artificially inflates the denominator $PT_1^{\\text{naive}}$ and deflates the estimated hazard for the exposed group.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Relative Bias ($B_{\\text{rel}}$)\n\nThe relative bias is defined as:\n$$ B_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{\\widehat{\\mathrm{HR}}_{\\text{naive}} - \\widehat{\\mathrm{HR}}_{\\text{time-dep}}}{\\widehat{\\mathrm{HR}}_{\\text{time-dep}}} $$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$ B_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{\\frac{39}{55} - \\frac{30}{7}}{\\frac{30}{7}} = \\frac{\\widehat{\\mathrm{HR}}_{\\text{naive}}}{\\widehat{\\mathrm{HR}}_{\\text{time-dep}}} - 1 $$\nFirst, we compute the ratio of the HR estimates:\n$$ \\frac{\\widehat{\\mathrm{HR}}_{\\text{naive}}}{\\widehat{\\mathrm{HR}}_{\\text{time-dep}}} = \\frac{39/55}{30/7} = \\frac{39}{55} \\times \\frac{7}{30} = \\frac{273}{1650} $$\nWe can simplify this fraction:\n$$ \\frac{273 \\div 3}{1650 \\div 3} = \\frac{91}{550} $$\nNow, we calculate the bias:\n$$ B_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{91}{550} - 1 = \\frac{91 - 550}{550} = -\\frac{459}{550} $$\nTo provide the answer in the required format, we convert this fraction to a decimal:\n$$ B_{\\text{rel}} = -\\frac{459}{550} \\approx -0.83454545... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $-0.8345$. The large negative bias illustrates the severe analytic error introduced by the naive classification, which in this case incorrectly reverses the direction of the effect from harmful ($\\widehat{\\mathrm{HR}}_{\\text{time-dep}} \\approx 4.29$) to seemingly protective ($\\widehat{\\mathrm{HR}}_{\\text{naive}} \\approx 0.71$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.8345}$$", "id": "4858944"}]}
