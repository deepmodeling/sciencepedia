To ensure an exact fractional result, we convert these to fractions: $x_1 = \\frac{1}{10}$, $x_2 = \\frac{1}{5}$, $x_3 = \\frac{1}{4}$, $x_4 = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the sample mean $\\bar{x}$:\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{2}{5} \\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{2+4+5+8}{20} \\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{19}{20} \\right) = \\frac{19}{80}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the deviations from the mean, $z_i = x_i - \\bar{x}$:\n$$\nz_1 = \\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{19}{80} = \\frac{8}{80} - \\frac{19}{80} = -\\frac{11}{80} \\\\\nz_2 = \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{19}{80} = \\frac{16}{80} - \\frac{19}{80} = -\\frac{3}{80} \\\\\nz_3 = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{19}{80} = \\frac{20}{80} - \\frac{19}{80} = \\frac{1}{80} \\\\\nz_4 = \\frac{2}{5} - \\frac{19}{80} = \\frac{32}{80} - \\frac{19}{80} = \\frac{13}{80}\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the denominator of Moran's $I$, the sum of squared deviations:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{4} z_i^2 = \\left(-\\frac{11}{80}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{3}{80}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{80}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{13}{80}\\right)^2 \\\\\n= \\frac{121}{6400} + \\frac{9}{6400} + \\frac{1}{6400} + \\frac{169}{6400} = \\frac{121+9+1+169}{6400} = \\frac{300}{6400} = \\frac{3}{64}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the total weight $S_0$ by summing all entries in the matrix $\\mathbf{W}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{W} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0  1  0  0 \\\\\n1  0  1  0 \\\\\n0  1  0  1 \\\\\n0  0  1  0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nS_0 = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\sum_{j=1}^{4} w_{ij} = 1+1+1+1+1+1 = 6\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerator's spatial cross-product term. The sum is non-zero only for adjacent pairs where $w_{ij}=1$. Given the symmetric nature of $\\mathbf{W}$ and the term $z_i z_j$, the sum is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\sum_{j=1}^{4} w_{ij} z_i z_j = 2(w_{12}z_1z_2 + w_{23}z_2z_3 + w_{34}z_3z_4)\n$$\nSubstituting the values of $z_i$:\n$$\nz_1z_2 = \\left(-\\frac{11}{80}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{3}{80}\\right) = \\frac{33}{6400} \\\\\nz_2z_3 = \\left(-\\frac{3}{80}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{80}\\right) = -\\frac{3}{6400} \\\\\nz_3z_4 = \\left(\\frac{1}{80}\\right)\\left(\\frac{13}{80}\\right) = \\frac{13}{6400}\n$$\nThe sum is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\sum_{j=1}^{4} w_{ij} z_i z_j = 2\\left(\\frac{33}{6400} - \\frac{3}{6400} + \\frac{13}{6400}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{33 - 3 + 13}{6400}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{43}{6400}\\right) = \\frac{86}{6400} = \\frac{43}{3200}\n$$\n\nFinally, we assemble all components to calculate Moran's $I$:\n$$\nI = \\frac{n}{S_0} \\frac{\\sum \\sum w_{ij} z_i z_j}{\\sum z_i^2} = \\frac{4}{6} \\frac{\\frac{43}{3200}}{\\frac{3}{64}}\n$$\n$$\nI = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{43}{3200} \\cdot \\frac{64}{3} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 43 \\cdot 64}{3 \\cdot 3200 \\cdot 3}\n$$\nSince $3200 = 50 \\times 64$, we can simplify:\n$$\nI = \\frac{2 \\cdot 43 \\cdot 64}{9 \\cdot (50 \\cdot 64)} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 43}{9 \\cdot 50} = \\frac{86}{450} = \\frac{43}{225}\n$$\nThe value $43$ is a prime number, and $225 = 3^2 \\cdot 5^2$ is not divisible by $43$. Therefore, the fraction is in its simplest form.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{43}{225}}$$", "id": "4855877"}]}
