This exercise demonstrates a key step in this process known as assertion normalization, where mentions of a condition are classified by their context (e.g., affirmed, negated, or historical). You will extract these normalized features from text snippets and then use them in a provided logistic regression model to see how they directly influence a patient's predicted disease probability. [@problem_id:4830001]", "problem": "A patient’s clinical corpus includes two note snippets:\n1) “no history of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD),”\n2) “COPD exacerbation last year.”\n\nIn computational phenotyping, assertion normalization maps raw mentions to categorical features that encode both assertion status (affirmed versus negated) and temporality (current versus historical). The fundamental base for this task is:\n\n- The definition of assertion categories commonly used in clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP): affirmed-present, affirmed-historical, and negated (widely adopted in clinical NLP evaluations and phenotyping pipelines).\n- The generalized linear model with a logit link, which relates the log-odds of a phenotype to a linear combination of normalized features.\n\nConstruct normalized features as follows. Let $x_{\\text{present}}$ be the count of affirmed-present mentions of COPD, $x_{\\text{historical}}$ be the count of affirmed-historical mentions of COPD, and $x_{\\text{negated}}$ be the count of negated mentions of COPD. Treat each snippet as an independent mention, classified by assertion and temporality using rule-based cues such as explicit negation terms (“no”) and temporal indicators (“history,” “last year”).

The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and internally consistent.

Assertion Normalization and Feature Extraction**\n\nWe analyze each snippet to determine its assertion category and then aggregate the counts to form the feature vector $(x_{\\text{present}}, x_{\\text{historical}}, x_{\\text{negated}})$.\n\n- **Snippet 1**: “no history of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD),”\n  The cue “no” explicitly negates the mention of COPD. According to the problem's defined categories, this falls under the `negated` status. Therefore, this snippet contributes a count of $1$ to $x_{\\text{negated}}$.\n\n- **Snippet 2**: “COPD exacerbation last year.”\n  The phrase “last year” is a temporal indicator that places the event in the past. The statement is an affirmation of a past event. Thus, this snippet corresponds to the `affirmed-historical` category and contributes a count of $1$ to $x_{\\text{historical}}$.\n\nThere are no snippets indicating a currently active case of COPD. Therefore, the count for `affirmed-present` is $0$.\n\nAggregating these counts, we obtain the feature vector:\n- $x_{\\text{present}} = 0$\n- $x_{\\text{historical}} = 1$\n- $x_{\\text{negated}} = 1$\n\n**2.

The formula for the linear predictor is:\n$$ \\eta = \\beta_0 + \\beta_{\\text{present}} x_{\\text{present}} + \\beta_{\\text{historical}} x_{\\text{historical}} + \\beta_{\\text{negated}} x_{\\text{negated}} $$\nWe substitute the given coefficients and the extracted feature values into this equation:\n- $\\beta_{0} = -2.5$\n- $\\beta_{\\text{present}} = 2.0$\n- $\\beta_{\\text{historical}} = 1.2$\n- $\\beta_{\\text{negated}} = -1.5$\n- $x_{\\text{present}} = 0$\n- $x_{\\text{historical}} = 1$\n- $x_{\\text{negated}} = 1$\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n$$ \\eta = -2.5 + (2.0 \\times 0) + (1.2 \\times 1) + (-1.5 \\times 1) $$\n$$ \\eta = -2.5 + 0 + 1.2 - 1.5 $$\n$$ \\eta = -2.5 - 0.3 $$\n$$ \\eta = -2.8 $$\nThis value, $\\eta = -2.8$, represents the log-odds of the patient currently having COPD.\n\n**3. Conversion to Probability**\n\nThe probability $p$ is obtained by applying the logistic function (the inverse of the logit link function) to the log-odds $\\eta$:\n$$ p = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\eta)} $$\nSubstituting the calculated value of $\\eta = -2.8$:\n$$ p = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-(-2.8))} $$\n$$ p = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(2.8)} $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value.\n$$ \\exp(2.8) \\approx 16.44464677 $$\n$$ p \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 16.44464677} = \\frac{1}{17.44464677} $$\n$$ p \\approx 0.057319601... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is $5$, followed by $7$, $3$, and $1$. The fifth significant figure is $9$, which means we round up the fourth one.\n$$ p \\approx 0.05732 $$\nThus, the predicted probability that the patient currently has COPD is $0.05732$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.05732}$$", "id": "4830001"}, {"introduction": "A phenotyping model's theoretical accuracy, measured by sensitivity and specificity, does not tell the whole story of its real-world performance.

Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$\nPPV = P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T)}\n$$\nTo find $P(T)$, the total probability of a positive test, we use the law of total probability, summing over the mutually exclusive scenarios of having the disease or not:\n$$\nP(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)\n$$\nSubstituting the symbolic definitions:\n$$\nP(T) = s\\pi + (1-c)(1-\\pi)\n$$\nNow, substituting this expression for $P(T)$ back into the Bayes' theorem formula for $PPV$:\n$$\nPPV = \\frac{s\\pi}{s\\pi + (1-c)(1-\\pi)}\n$$\nThis is the required expression for $PPV$ in terms of $\\pi$, $s$, and $c$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the given inputs: $\\pi = 0.1$, $s = 0.9$, and $c = 0.95$.\n$$\nPPV = \\frac{(0.9)(0.1)}{(0.9)(0.1) + (1 - 0.95)(1 - 0.1)} = \\frac{0.09}{0.09 + (0.05)(0.9)} = \\frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.045} = \\frac{0.09}{0.135}\n$$\n$$\nPPV = \\frac{90}{135} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.66666...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the $PPV$ is $0.6667$.\n\n**2.

Implications for Clinical Deployment**\n\n- **Positive Predictive Value ($PPV \\approx 0.6667$):** This result indicates that when the model flags a patient as positive, there is a $66.7\\%$ probability that the patient actually has the condition. Conversely, this means that approximately $1$ in $3$ positive alerts ($1 - 0.6667 \\approx 0.3333$) are false positives. A high burden of false positives can lead to alert fatigue among clinicians, unnecessary follow-up testing (which carries its own risks and costs), and undue patient anxiety. Therefore, a positive result from this model should not be used to make a definitive diagnosis or initiate high-risk interventions.\n\n- **Negative Predictive Value ($NPV \\approx 0.9884$):** This result is the model's primary strength. It indicates that when the model flags a patient as negative, there is a $98.8\\%$ probability that the patient truly does not have the condition. The rate of false negatives among those who test negative is very low ($1 - 0.9884 = 0.0116$, or about $1.16\\%$). This high degree of confidence in a negative result is extremely valuable.\n\n- **Workflow Positioning:** Given the moderate $PPV$ and very high $NPV$, the model is best positioned as a **screening or rule-out tool**. Its primary clinical utility is to reliably identify a large cohort of patients who are at very low risk for the condition, allowing clinical attention and resources to be focused elsewhere. For patients who screen positive, the alert should be treated as a trigger for further, more definitive diagnostic workup to confirm the presence of the condition before any significant clinical action is taken. The model is not suitable as a stand-alone diagnostic \"rule-in\" test due to its substantial false positive rate.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.6667  0.9884 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4829979"}]}
