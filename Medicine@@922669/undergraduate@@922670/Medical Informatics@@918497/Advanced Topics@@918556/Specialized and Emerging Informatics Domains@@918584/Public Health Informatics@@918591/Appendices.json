Each visit is assigned a binary syndrome label based on a case definition rule, which marks a visit as a case ($\\hat{Y}=1$) or a non-case ($\\hat{Y}=0$). Let the true, unobserved disease status be a binary variable $Y \\in \\{0,1\\}$, where $Y=1$ denotes a true incident case and $Y=0$ denotes a true non-case. Assume that the case definition has sensitivity $s$ and specificity $c$, defined by the core epidemiologic principles $s = P(\\hat{Y}=1 \\mid Y=1)$ and $c = P(\\hat{Y}=0 \\mid Y=0)$.

A perfect proxy or measurement would mean that the predicted label $\\hat{Y}$ is always identical to the true status $Y$. This would imply that $P(\\hat{Y}=Y) = 1$. In the context of this problem, a perfect classification system would correctly identify all true cases and all true non-cases. This corresponds to a sensitivity $s = P(\\hat{Y}=1 \\mid Y=1) = 1$ and a specificity $c = P(\\hat{Y}=0 \\mid Y=0) = 1$.\n\nHowever, in any practical syndromic surveillance system, the case definition rule is imperfect. This imperfection manifests as values of sensitivity and specificity that are less than $1$.\nIf the sensitivity $s  1$, then the probability of misclassifying a true case as a non-case (a false negative) is greater than zero:\n$$P(\\hat{Y}=0 \\mid Y=1) = 1 - P(\\hat{Y}=1 \\mid Y=1) = 1 - s  0$$\nIf the specificity $c  1$, then the probability of misclassifying a true non-case as a case (a false positive) is also greater than zero:\n$$P(\\hat{Y}=1 \\mid Y=0) = 1 - P(\\hat{Y}=0 \\mid Y=0) = 1 - c  0$$\nSince at least one, and typically both, of these misclassification probabilities ($1-s$ and $1-c$) are non-zero, the predicted label $\\hat{Y}$ will not deterministically equal the true status $Y$. There is a non-zero probability that $\\hat{Y} \\neq Y$. This probabilistic discrepancy between the observation ($\\hat{Y}$) and the true state of nature ($Y$) is the definition of noise. Therefore, the syndrome-based label $\\hat{Y}$ is a noisy proxy for the true disease status $Y$.\n\nNext, we derive a closed-form expression for the expected misclassification error probability, $P(\\hat{Y} \\neq Y)$. The event of a misclassification, $\\hat{Y} \\neq Y$, can be partitioned based on the true underlying disease status, $Y$. We can apply the law of total probability by conditioning on the two possible states of $Y$, which are $Y=1$ (true case) and $Y=0$ (true non-case). The set of these two events forms a partition of the sample space.\n\nThe total probability of misclassification is given by:\n$$P(\\hat{Y} \\neq Y) = P(\\hat{Y} \\neq Y \\mid Y=1)P(Y=1) + P(\\hat{Y} \\neq Y \\mid Y=0)P(Y=0)$$\n\nWe now evaluate each term in this expression using the definitions provided in the problem statement.\nThe probability of a misclassification given that the true status is a case ($Y=1$) is the probability of a false negative:\n$$P(\\hat{Y} \\neq Y \\mid Y=1) = P(\\hat{Y}=0 \\mid Y=1) = 1 - P(\\hat{Y}=1 \\mid Y=1) = 1 - s$$\nThe probability of a misclassification given that the true status is a non-case ($Y=0$) is the probability of a false positive:\n$$P(\\hat{Y} \\neq Y \\mid Y=0) = P(\\hat{Y}=1 \\mid Y=0) = 1 - P(\\hat{Y}=0 \\mid Y=0) = 1 - c$$\nThe a priori probabilities of being a true case or a true non-case are given by the incidence proportion $p$ and its complement:\n$$P(Y=1) = p$$\n$$P(Y=0) = 1 - P(Y=1) = 1 - p$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the equation for the law of total probability, we obtain the expression for the total misclassification error probability:\n$$P(\\hat{Y} \\neq Y) = (1 - s) \\cdot p + (1 - c) \\cdot (1 - p)$$\n\nThis expression represents the weighted average of the two types of error rates (the false negative rate, $1-s$, and the false positive rate, $1-c$), where the weights are the respective probabilities of each class (the incidence $p$ and its complement $1-p$). This is the final closed-form expression for the expected misclassification error probability in terms of $p$, $s$, and $c$. We can also write it by expanding the terms:\n$$P(\\hat{Y} \\neq Y) = p - ps + 1 - p - c + pc = 1 - c + pc - ps = 1 - c + p(c - s)$$\nHowever, the form $p(1-s) + (1-p)(1-c)$ is more directly interpretable as it sums the probabilities of the two disjoint ways an error can occur: a false negative, with probability $p(1-s)$, and a false positive, with probability $(1-p)(1-c)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{p(1-s) + (1-p)(1-c)}$$", "id": "4854441"}, {"introduction": "A common task in public health is comparing disease rates between different regions to identify hotspots and allocate resources.

This conclusion is opposite to that from the ASRs. The discrepancy arises because of confounding by age. The incidence of the condition increases sharply with age in both regions. Region A has an older population structure (e.g., $\\frac{50,000}{350,000} \\approx 14.3\\%$ are age $\\geq 65$) compared to Region B ($\\frac{40,000}{460,000} \\approx 8.7\\%$ are age $\\geq 65$). The larger proportion of older, high-risk individuals in Region A inflates its crude rate. Age-standardization removes this confounding effect by applying a common age structure, which reveals that Region B has higher incidence risk when age is accounted for, primarily driven by its higher rates in the two older age strata ($r_{B,2}r_{A,2}$ and $r_{B,3}r_{A,3}$).\n\nFinally, we compute the standardized rate difference, $\\text{ASR}_{B}-\\text{ASR}_{A}$.\n$$ \\text{ASR}_{B} - \\text{ASR}_{A} = 114.75 - 105 = 9.75 $$\nThe problem requires this answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.
