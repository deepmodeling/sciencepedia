This practice provides a concrete exercise in measuring completeness, one of the most critical data quality dimensions in healthcare.

Under the completeness dimension of data quality, the governing definition specifies that completeness for a mandated data element is the proportion of eligible inpatient episodes for which at least one valid value is captured within the required timeframe, where episodes count in the numerator only if there is at least one valid value recorded within the timeframe and duplicates or values recorded after the timeframe do not increase the numerator nor change the denominator. During Quarter $2$ of year $2025$, there were $10{,}000$ inpatient admissions that met eligibility criteria for this measure. The Electronic Health Record (EHR) shows that $8{,}000$ of these eligible admissions have at least one hemoglobin laboratory result timestamped no later than $24$ hours after the admission time. All remaining eligible admissions either have no hemoglobin result or have only hemoglobin results recorded after $24$ hours. Using the fundamental definition of completeness described above as a proportion of eligible episodes with a valid within-timeframe value, compute the hemoglobin completeness rate for this period.

The problem statement provides a precise definition of this metric.\n\nThe completeness rate, denoted here as $C$, is defined as the proportion of eligible inpatient episodes for which at least one valid value is captured within the required timeframe. This can be expressed as a ratio:\n$$\nC = \\frac{\\text{Number of eligible episodes with at least one valid, timely value}}{\\text{Total number of eligible episodes}}\n$$\nLet $N_{total}$ be the total number of eligible inpatient episodes, which forms the denominator of the ratio.\nLet $N_{complete}$ be the number of eligible episodes that meet the completeness criterion, which forms the numerator.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the givens are:\n1. The total number of eligible inpatient episodes during Quarter $2$ of year $2025$ is $N_{total} = 10,000$.\n2. The number of these eligible admissions that have at least one hemoglobin laboratory result recorded within the required timeframe (no later than $24$ hours after admission) is $N_{complete} = 8,000$.\n3. The remaining episodes ($10,000 - 8,000 = 2,000$) do not meet the criterion, as they either have no result or have results recorded after the $24$-hour timeframe. This confirms that all cases are accounted for and the numerator is precisely $8,000$.\n\nUsing the formal definition, the completeness rate $C$ is calculated as:\n$$\nC = \\frac{N_{complete}}{N_{total}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$\nC = \\frac{8,000}{10,000}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\nC = 0.8\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal number rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $0.8$. To express this value with four significant figures, we must include trailing zeros. The first significant figure is $8$. To achieve a total of four significant figures, we append three zeros after the $8$.\nTherefore, the completeness rate expressed to four significant figures is $0.8000$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8000}$$", "id": "4832355"}, {"introduction": "A core responsibility in healthcare data stewardship is balancing data utility for research with the non-negotiable requirement of protecting patient privacy. This exercise introduces the concept of $k$-anonymity, a formal privacy guarantee used in data de-identification.

This advanced practice challenges you to translate the qualitative FAIR principles—Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability—into a quantitative, composite score derived from logical axioms. This problem illustrates how governance frameworks use principled measurement to objectively evaluate and improve the utility of research data repositories [@problem_id:4832321].", "problem": "A health system’s research data repository is being evaluated for compliance with the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles, where FAIR stands for Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. Each FAIR principle is scored on a normalized scale from $0$ to $1$, and policy-set importance weights for each principle are also specified and normalized to sum to $1$. The governance committee requires a composite FAIR compliance score that respects the following fundamental design principles rooted in data stewardship best practices:\n\n1. Normalization: If all principle scores are $0$, the composite is $0$; if all principle scores are $1$, the composite equals $1$.\n2. Monotonicity: Increasing any single principle score while holding all others fixed must not decrease the composite score.\n3. Independence (separability): The marginal contribution of any single principle to the composite depends only on its own score and its own weight, not directly on the values of other principles.\n4. Weight calibration: A dataset that is perfect on one principle ($1$) and null on others ($0$) must have a composite score equal to the weight of that principle, reflecting governance-defined importance.\n\nStarting only from these principles, derive a valid functional form for the composite FAIR compliance score in terms of the individual principle scores and their weights. Then compute the composite score for a healthcare repository with findability $=0.9$, accessibility $=0.7$, interoperability $=0.6$, and reusability $=0.8$, and with weights $\\left(0.25,\\,0.25,\\,0.25,\\,0.25\\right)$. Express the final composite score as a decimal number and round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "### Solution Derivation\n\nLet the scores of the four principles be denoted by the vector $\\vec{S} = (S_F, S_A, S_I, S_R)$ and the corresponding weights by $\\vec{w} = (w_F, w_A, w_I, w_R)$. We seek the functional form of the composite score $C(\\vec{S}, \\vec{w})$. Let's denote the principles by indices $i = 1, 2, 3, 4$.\n\n1.  **Independence (Separability) Principle:** This is the most restrictive and thus most powerful principle. It states that the marginal contribution of any principle $i$ depends only on its own score $S_i$ and its own weight $w_i$. Mathematically, this means the partial derivative of the composite score with respect to a principle's score is a function only of that principle's score and weight:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S_i} = f_i(S_i, w_i)$$\n    This implies that the composite function $C$ must be additively separable. Integrating with respect to each $S_i$ shows that $C$ must have the form:\n    $$C(\\vec{S}, \\vec{w}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} g_i(S_i, w_i) + K(\\vec{w})$$\n    where each function $g_i$ depends only on the score and weight of a single principle, and $K$ is a constant of integration that can only depend on the weights.\n\n2.  **Normalization Principle (Part 1):** If all scores are $0$, the composite score is $0$.\n    $$C(\\vec{0}, \\vec{w}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} g_i(0, w_i) + K(\\vec{w}) = 0$$\n\n3.  **Weight Calibration Principle:** If a single score $S_j=1$ and all other scores $S_{i \\neq j}=0$, the composite score is $w_j$.\n    $$C(\\vec{e}_j, \\vec{w}) = g_j(1, w_j) + \\sum_{i \\neq j} g_i(0, w_i) + K(\\vec{w}) = w_j$$\n    where $\\vec{e}_j$ is the vector with a $1$ in the $j$-th position and $0$s elsewhere.\n    We can rewrite the sum as $\\sum_{i \\neq j} g_i(0, w_i) = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{4} g_i(0, w_i) \\right) - g_j(0, w_j)$.\n    Substituting this into the equation gives:\n    $$g_j(1, w_j) + \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{4} g_i(0, w_i) \\right) - g_j(0, w_j) + K(\\vec{w}) = w_j$$\n    From the first normalization condition, we know that $\\sum_{i=1}^{4} g_i(0, w_i) + K(\\vec{w}) = 0$. Substituting this into the above equation yields:\n    $$g_j(1, w_j) - g_j(0, w_j) = w_j$$\n    This relationship must hold for each principle $j=1, 2, 3, 4$.\n\n4.  **Monotonicity Principle:** The composite score must be non-decreasing with any individual score. This means $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S_i} \\ge 0$. For our separable form, this means:\n    $$\\frac{d g_i(S_i, w_i)}{d S_i} \\ge 0$$\n    So, each function $g_i$ must be a non-decreasing function of its score $S_i$.\n\nLet's find the simplest form for $g_i(S_i, w_i)$ that satisfies these conditions. A linear function in $S_i$ is the most straightforward choice:\n$$g_i(S_i, w_i) = A_i(w_i) \\cdot S_i + B_i(w_i)$$\nFrom the relation $g_j(1, w_j) - g_j(0, w_j) = w_j$, we have:\n$$(A_j(w_j) \\cdot 1 + B_j(w_j)) - (A_j(w_j) \\cdot 0 + B_j(w_j)) = w_j$$\n$$A_j(w_j) = w_j$$\nSo the function has the form $g_i(S_i, w_i) = w_i S_i + B_i(w_i)$. The composite score is then:\n$$C(\\vec{S}, \\vec{w}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} (w_i S_i + B_i(w_i)) + K(\\vec{w}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} w_i S_i + \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{4} B_i(w_i) + K(\\vec{w}) \\right)$$\nLet the term entirely dependent on weights be a single function $W(\\vec{w}) = \\sum_i B_i(w_i) + K(\\vec{w})$.\n$$C(\\vec{S}, \\vec{w}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} w_i S_i + W(\\vec{w})$$\nNow, we apply the first normalization condition again: if all $S_i=0$, then $C=0$.\n$$C(\\vec{0}, \\vec{w}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} w_i \\cdot 0 + W(\\vec{w}) = 0 \\implies W(\\vec{w}) = 0$$\nThis fully determines the functional form:\n$$C(\\vec{S}, \\vec{w}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} w_i S_i$$\nThis is the weighted arithmetic mean of the scores. Let's verify it against the final principle.\n\n5.  **Normalization Principle (Part 2):** If all scores are $1$, the composite score is $1$.\n    $$C(\\vec{1}, \\vec{w}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} w_i \\cdot 1 = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} w_i$$\n    The problem states that the weights are normalized to sum to $1$, so $\\sum_{i=1}^{4} w_i = 1$. Thus, $C(\\vec{1}, \\vec{w})=1$. The principle is satisfied.\n\nThe derived functional form for the composite FAIR compliance score is the weighted sum of the individual principle scores.\n\n### Calculation\n\nWe are asked to compute the composite score for the following values:\n- Scores: $S_F=0.9$ (Findability), $S_A=0.7$ (Accessibility), $S_I=0.6$ (Interoperability), $S_R=0.8$ (Reusability).\n- Weights: $w_F=0.25$, $w_A=0.25$, $w_I=0.25$, $w_R=0.25$.\n\nUsing the derived formula $C = \\sum_{i} w_i S_i$:\n$$C = w_F S_F + w_A S_A + w_I S_I + w_R S_R$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$C = (0.25)(0.9) + (0.25)(0.7) + (0.25)(0.6) + (0.25)(0.8)$$\nWe can factor out the common weight of $0.25$:\n$$C = 0.25 \\times (0.9 + 0.7 + 0.6 + 0.8)$$\n$$C = 0.25 \\times (3.0)$$\n$$C = 0.75$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal number rounded to four significant figures. The number $0.75$ is exact. To express it with four significant figures, we must add two trailing zeros after the decimal places.\n\nFinal result: $0.7500$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7500}$$", "id": "4832321"}]}
