A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe problem asks for two quantities: the steady-state availability and the expected downtime over a specific period.\n\nFirst, we calculate the steady-state availability, denoted by $A$. The problem provides the fundamental definition that availability is the ratio of the expected operational duration to the expected total cycle duration. An operational cycle consists of one operational period followed by one repair period.\n\nThe expected operational duration is given as the Mean Time Between Failures, $MTBF$.\n$$ \\text{Expected Operational Duration} = MTBF $$\nThe expected repair duration is given as the Mean Time To Repair, $MTTR$.\n$$ \\text{Expected Repair Duration} = MTTR $$\nThe expected cycle duration is the sum of the expected operational duration and the expected repair duration.\n$$ \\text{Expected Cycle Duration} = MTBF + MTTR $$\nUsing the formula provided in the problem statement, the steady-state availability $A$ is:\n$$ A = \\frac{MTBF}{MTBF + MTTR} $$\nWe are given $MTBF = 200$ hours and $MTTR = 2$ hours. Substituting these values into the equation:\n$$ A = \\frac{200}{200 + 2} = \\frac{200}{202} $$\nTo express this as a decimal, we perform the division:\n$$ A = \\frac{200}{202} = \\frac{100}{101} \\approx 0.99009900... $$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $9$, $9$, $0$, and $0$. The fifth significant figure is $9$, which is $5$ or greater, so we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$ A \\approx 0.9901 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the expected downtime over a $30$-day month. First, we determine the total time in this period, $T_{total}$.\n$$ T_{total} = 30 \\text{ days} \\times 24 \\frac{\\text{hours}}{\\text{day}} = 720 \\text{ hours} $$\nDowntime is the time the system is not operational. The proportion of time the system is not operational is its unavailability, $U$. Unavailability is the complement of availability:\n$$ U = 1 - A $$\nThe expected downtime, $D_{time}$, over a period $T_{total}$ is the product of the unavailability and the total time.\n$$ D_{time} = U \\times T_{total} = (1 - A) \\times T_{total} $$\nUsing the exact fractional form of $A$ for precision:\n$$ D_{time} = \\left(1 - \\frac{200}{202}\\right) \\times 720 = \\left(\\frac{202 - 200}{202}\\right) \\times 720 = \\frac{2}{202} \\times 720 $$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$ D_{time} = \\frac{1}{101} \\times 720 = \\frac{720}{101} \\text{ hours} $$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$ D_{time} \\approx 7.12871287... \\text{ hours} $$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $7$, $1$, $2$, and $8$. The fifth significant figure is $7$, which is $5$ or greater, so we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$ D_{time} \\approx 7.129 \\text{ hours} $$\n\nThe two required quantities are the steady-state availability, $0.9901$, and the expected downtime, $7.129$ hours.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.9901 & 7.129 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4838344"}, {"introduction": "Modern Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems are no longer just digital filing cabinets; they actively process clinical text to extract vital information, such as medication mentions.

The methodology of calculating a composite score via equal weighting is a common and accepted practice. The scenario is realistic and factually sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed.

It is free of ambiguity and bias.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the overall workload score using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) with an equal weighting scheme. The overall score, denoted by $W$, is the arithmetic mean of the scores of the six individual subscales.\n\nThe six subscales and their given scores are:\n- Mental Demand ($S_M$) = $70$\n- Physical Demand ($S_P$) = $30$\n- Temporal Demand ($S_T$) = $60$\n- Performance ($S_{Pf}$) = $40$\n- Effort ($S_E$) = $65$\n- Frustration ($S_F$) = $50$\n\nThe formula for the equally weighted composite score $W$ is the sum of the subscale scores divided by the number of subscales, which is $6$.\n$$ W = \\frac{S_M + S_P + S_T + S_{Pf} + S_E + S_F}{6} $$\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$ W = \\frac{70 + 30 + 60 + 40 + 65 + 50}{6} $$\n\nPerforming the summation in the numerator:\n$$ \\sum S_i = (70 + 30) + (60 + 40) + (65 + 50) $$\n$$ \\sum S_i = 100 + 100 + 115 $$\n$$ \\sum S_i = 315 $$\n\nNow, we compute the average:\n$$ W = \\frac{315}{6} $$\n$$ W = 52.5 $$\n\nThe overall workload score is $52.5$ on a scale from $0$ to $100$.\n\n### Interpretation of the Score\n\nAn overall score of $52.5$ represents a moderate level of perceived workload. To understand the implications for design, it is crucial to analyze the individual subscale scores, as they reveal the specific drivers of this workload.\n\nThe highest contributing factors to the workload are Mental Demand ($70$), Effort ($65$), and Temporal Demand ($60$). These scores suggest that the clinician found the task of interacting with the alert module to be cognitively challenging, requiring significant mental exertion, and felt rushed or time-pressured.\n\nConversely, the Physical Demand score is low ($30$), indicating that the physical actions required (e.g., mouse clicks, typing) were not a source of strain. The Performance score of $40$ is also notable. In the NASA-TLX methodology, the Performance scale is inverted; a lower score indicates a higher perceived level of success in accomplishing the task's goals. Thus, a score of $40$ suggests the clinician felt they performed the task reasonably well, despite the high mental effort. The Frustration score ($50$) is at the midpoint of the scale, indicating a non-trivial but not overwhelming level of irritation or stress.\n\nBased on this analysis, the primary design priority for improving the alert module should be the reduction of cognitive load. The high scores for Mental Demand, Effort, and Temporal Demand point to specific areas for intervention. Design priorities for the EHR CDS alert module should focus on:\n1.  **Reducing Mental Demand:** Simplify the information content of the alert. Ensure it is clear, concise, and immediately understandable. Use formatting, color, and iconography to highlight the most critical information and the recommended action, minimizing the need for the user to interpret complex data.\n2.  **Reducing Effort and Temporal Demand:** Streamline the workflow associated with the alert. The interaction should be efficient, allowing for a rapid response that does not disrupt the primary task of medication ordering. For instance, if the alert suggests an alternative, it should be selectable with a minimum number of clicks, directly populating the order field. The alert should also be timed appropriately within the workflow to avoid creating a sense of being rushed.\n\nThe low physical demand score confirms that redesigning the physical user interface is not a priority. The moderate performance and frustration scores suggest that while the system imposes a high cognitive burden, it does not completely hinder task completion or induce extreme negative affect, but there is significant room for improvement in the user experience.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{52.5} $$", "id": "4838467"}]}
