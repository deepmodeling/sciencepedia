{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A Learning Health System is built upon a foundation of high-quality data, but not all data flaws are created equal. This practice challenges you to move beyond abstract labels like 'completeness' or 'correctness' and construct a unified data quality score grounded in real-world consequences. By weighting different quality dimensions based on their potential to cause harm, you will develop the critical skill of linking data governance decisions directly to the ultimate goal of improving patient outcomes [@problem_id:4861048].", "problem": "A hospital network operates a Learning Health System (LHS) that continuously updates hypertension management rules from Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. Four data quality dimensions are tracked, each measured on the unit interval $[0,1]$: completeness $q_{\\text{comp}}$, correctness $q_{\\text{corr}}$, timeliness $q_{\\text{time}}$, and consistency $q_{\\text{cons}}$. In the current cycle, the measured values are $q_{\\text{comp}}=0.88$, $q_{\\text{corr}}=0.92$, $q_{\\text{time}}=0.75$, and $q_{\\text{cons}}=0.80$.\n\nTo align data quality assessment with the LHS objective of minimizing expected harm from data-driven decisions, consider the following empirically supported facts for this clinical domain and data pipeline:\n- In a typical update cycle, incompleteness produces an average of $24$ misclassifications, each with an expected utility loss of $1.8$ units.\n- Incorrect records produce an average of $15$ misclassifications, each with an expected utility loss of $2.5$ units.\n- Untimely data lead to an average of $30$ delayed interventions, each with an expected utility loss of $1.2$ units.\n- Inconsistencies across sites produce an average of $10$ transportability failures, each with an expected utility loss of $3.0$ units.\n\nStarting from the decision-theoretic base that expected loss aggregates across independent sources and that small changes in each quality dimension near the current operating point affect the expected loss linearly to first order, construct a scalar Data Quality Score $S \\in [0,1]$ that aggregates the four dimensions using a justified weighting scheme grounded in their marginal contributions to expected loss. Compute the resulting $S$ for the given measurements. Round your final score to four significant figures and express it as a decimal between $0$ and $1$.", "solution": "The problem requires the construction of a scalar Data Quality Score, $S$, which aggregates four data quality dimensions: completeness ($q_{\\text{comp}}$), correctness ($q_{\\text{corr}}$), timeliness ($q_{\\text{time}}$), and consistency ($q_{\\text{cons}}$). The aggregation must be based on a weighting scheme justified by the marginal contributions of each dimension to the total expected utility loss. The score $S$ must be on the unit interval $[0,1]$.\n\nLet the four quality dimensions be denoted by $q_i$, for $i \\in \\{\\text{comp}, \\text{corr}, \\text{time}, \\text{cons}\\}$. Each $q_i \\in [0,1]$, where $q_i=1$ represents perfect quality and $q_i=0$ represents the worst possible quality. The total expected utility loss, $L_{\\text{total}}$, is stated to aggregate across independent sources. This implies an additive model for the total loss, where each quality dimension contributes a component to the loss.\n$$L_{\\text{total}} = L_{\\text{comp}}(q_{\\text{comp}}) + L_{\\text{corr}}(q_{\\text{corr}}) + L_{\\text{time}}(q_{\\text{time}}) + L_{\\text{cons}}(q_{\\text{cons}})$$\nThe problem states that small changes in $q_i$ affect the expected loss linearly. The simplest model consistent with this and the nature of quality scores is that the loss from a dimension $i$ is proportional to its \"defect\" level, which can be defined as $d_i = 1 - q_i$. Thus, we can model the loss component for each dimension $i$ as:\n$$L_i(q_i) = K_i (1 - q_i)$$\nwhere $K_i$ is a constant representing the maximum possible utility loss when the quality is at its worst ($q_i=0$). This linear form perfectly adheres to the problem's assumption.\n\nThe constants $K_i$ can be determined from the provided empirical data. These values represent the total expected loss associated with each type of data quality failure.\nFor incompleteness:\nThe loss is due to an average of $N_{\\text{comp}} = 24$ misclassifications, each with an expected utility loss of $U_{\\text{comp}} = 1.8$ units. The total potential loss is:\n$$K_{\\text{comp}} = N_{\\text{comp}} \\times U_{\\text{comp}} = 24 \\times 1.8 = 43.2$$\nFor incorrectness:\nThe loss is due to an average of $N_{\\text{corr}} = 15$ misclassifications, each with an expected utility loss of $U_{\\text{corr}} = 2.5$ units. The total potential loss is:\n$$K_{\\text{corr}} = N_{\\text{corr}} \\times U_{\\text{corr}} = 15 \\times 2.5 = 37.5$$\nFor untimeliness:\nThe loss is due to an average of $N_{\\text{time}} = 30$ delayed interventions, each with an expected utility loss of $U_{\\text{time}} = 1.2$ units. The total potential loss is:\n$$K_{\\text{time}} = N_{\\text{time}} \\times U_{\\text{time}} = 30 \\times 1.2 = 36.0$$\nFor inconsistency:\nThe loss is due to an average of $N_{\\text{cons}} = 10$ transportability failures, each with an expected utility loss of $U_{\\text{cons}} = 3.0$ units. The total potential loss is:\n$$K_{\\text{cons}} = N_{\\text{cons}} \\times U_{\\text{cons}} = 10 \\times 3.0 = 30.0$$\n\nThe total expected loss is therefore:\n$$L_{\\text{total}}(q_{\\text{comp}}, q_{\\text{corr}}, q_{\\text{time}}, q_{\\text{cons}}) = \\sum_{i} K_i (1 - q_i)$$\nThe problem specifies that the weighting scheme for the aggregate score $S$ should be \"grounded in their marginal contributions to expected loss\". The marginal contribution of quality dimension $q_i$ to the total loss is its partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial L_{\\text{total}}}{\\partial q_i}$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial L_{\\text{total}}}{\\partial q_i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_i} \\left( K_i (1 - q_i) \\right) = -K_i$$\nThe magnitude of this marginal contribution, $|\\frac{\\partial L_{\\text{total}}}{\\partial q_i}| = K_i$, represents the rate at which improving the quality score $q_i$ reduces the total loss. It is therefore logical to use these magnitudes as the weights, $w_i$, for each quality dimension in the aggregate score. A higher $K_i$ implies that the dimension $i$ has a greater impact on overall utility loss, and thus should be weighted more heavily in the quality score.\nSo, we set the weights $w_i = K_i$:\n$w_{\\text{comp}} = 43.2$\n$w_{\\text{corr}} = 37.5$\n$w_{\\text{time}} = 36.0$\n$w_{\\text{cons}} = 30.0$\n\nThe scalar Data Quality Score $S$ is constructed as the weighted average of the individual quality dimension scores:\n$$S = \\frac{\\sum_{i} w_i q_i}{\\sum_{i} w_i} = \\frac{w_{\\text{comp}}q_{\\text{comp}} + w_{\\text{corr}}q_{\\text{corr}} + w_{\\text{time}}q_{\\text{time}} + w_{\\text{cons}}q_{\\text{cons}}}{w_{\\text{comp}} + w_{\\text{corr}} + w_{\\text{time}} + w_{\\text{cons}}}$$\nThe given measured values for the quality dimensions are:\n$q_{\\text{comp}} = 0.88$\n$q_{\\text{corr}} = 0.92$\n$q_{\\text{time}} = 0.75$\n$q_{\\text{cons}} = 0.80$\n\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the weights:\n$$\\sum_{i} w_i = 43.2 + 37.5 + 36.0 + 30.0 = 146.7$$\nNext, we calculate the weighted sum of the quality scores:\n$$\\sum_{i} w_i q_i = (43.2 \\times 0.88) + (37.5 \\times 0.92) + (36.0 \\times 0.75) + (30.0 \\times 0.80)$$\n$$\\sum_{i} w_i q_i = 38.016 + 34.5 + 27.0 + 24.0 = 123.516$$\nNow, we compute the score $S$:\n$$S = \\frac{123.516}{146.7} \\approx 0.84196319...$$\nThe problem requires the final score to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$S \\approx 0.8420$$\nThis score represents an aggregate measure of data quality, weighted by the potential harm caused by deficiencies in each dimension, and properly resides within the specified range $[0, 1]$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8420}$$", "id": "4861048"}, {"introduction": "One of the central promises of the LHS is its ability to accelerate the translation of evidence into practice, a concept often termed 'learning velocity.'

Consider a single improvement item flowing through a sequential pipeline of six stages. The hospital experiences item arrivals that can be modeled as a homogeneous Poisson process, and each service stage (except scheduled governance/training stages) can be modeled as a Markovian arrival/Markovian service, single-server queue (M/M/1). The stages are:\n\n1. Data ingestion: arrival rate $\\lambda_{1}$ items/day, service rate $\\mu_{1}$ items/day.\n2. Data curation and quality assurance: arrival rate $\\lambda_{2}$ items/day, service rate $\\mu_{2}$ items/day.\n3. Analysis and evidence generation: arrival rate $\\lambda_{3}$ items/day, service rate $\\mu_{3}$ items/day.\n4.

Clinician training and adoption: training sessions occur periodically every $T_{a}$ days with average training duration $t_{a}$ days; adoption is deemed effective immediately after the training session.\n\nAssume a steady-state flow in which an item’s arrival process remains Poisson with the same rate through the sequential queues, each queue is stable with $\\lambda_{i}  \\mu_{i}$, and the scheduled governance and training stages contribute expected gating delays due to periodic timing. Use the following parameters for a large academic hospital:\n\n- $\\lambda_{1} = \\lambda_{2} = \\lambda_{3} = \\lambda_{5} = 30$ items/day,\n- $\\mu_{1} = 60$ items/day, $\\mu_{2} = 36$ items/day, $\\mu_{3} = 32$ items/day, $\\mu_{5} = 40$ items/day,\n- $T_{g} = 7$ days, $t_{g} = 0.5$ days,\n- $T_{a} = 14$ days, $t_{a} = 1$ day.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions of Poisson arrivals, exponential service, and steady-state queuing behavior, and using well-tested facts from queueing theory and renewal theory where appropriate, derive a closed-form expression for the expected total cycle time from initial data capture to effective practice change and evaluate it numerically with the given parameters. Then, based on your derivation, identify which stages act as bottlenecks that limit learning velocity and explain why in terms of utilization and expected delay contribution. Express the final cycle time in days. No rounding is required; provide the exact value.", "solution": "The problem describes a six-stage sequential process modeling a Learning Health System cycle. The total expected cycle time, $E[T_{\\text{total}}]$, for an item to pass through the entire system is the sum of the expected times spent in each individual stage, due to the linearity of expectation.\n$$E[T_{\\text{total}}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} E[T_i]$$\nWe analyze the expected time for each stage based on the provided model. The problem states that the arrival process is a homogeneous Poisson process and remains Poisson with the same rate through the sequential queues. The specified arrival rates are $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_2 = \\lambda_3 = \\lambda_5 = 30$ items/day. We can thus define a single system-wide arrival rate $\\lambda = 30$ items/day.\n\n**Analysis of M/M/1 Queuing Stages (Stages 1, 2, 3, 5)**\n\nStages $1$, $2$, $3$, and $5$ are modeled as M/M/1 queues. The assumption that the Poisson nature of the arrival process is preserved as it passes through these stages is justified by Burke's Theorem, which states that the departure process of a stable M/M/1 queue is also a Poisson process with the same rate as the arrival process.\n\nFor a stable M/M/1 queue with arrival rate $\\lambda$ and service rate $\\mu$ (where $\\lambda  \\mu$), the expected total time an item spends in the system (waiting in the queue plus being served), known as the sojourn time $W$, is given by the formula:\n$$W = \\frac{1}{\\mu - \\lambda}$$\nWe apply this formula to each of the four M/M/1 stages.\n\n- **Stage 1 (Data ingestion):**\nWith $\\lambda = 30$ items/day and $\\mu_1 = 60$ items/day, the expected time is:\n$$E[T_1] = \\frac{1}{\\mu_1 - \\lambda} = \\frac{1}{60 - 30} = \\frac{1}{30} \\text{ days}$$\n\n- **Stage 2 (Data curation):**\nWith $\\lambda = 30$ items/day and $\\mu_2 = 36$ items/day, the expected time is:\n$$E[T_2] = \\frac{1}{\\mu_2 - \\lambda} = \\frac{1}{36 - 30} = \\frac{1}{6} \\text{ days}$$\n\n- **Stage 3 (Analysis):**\nWith $\\lambda = 30$ items/day and $\\mu_3 = 32$ items/day, the expected time is:\n$$E[T_3] = \\frac{1}{\\mu_3 - \\lambda} = \\frac{1}{32 - 30} = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ days}$$\n\n- **Stage 5 (EHR configuration):**\nWith $\\lambda = 30$ items/day and $\\mu_5 = 40$ items/day, the expected time is:\n$$E[T_5] = \\frac{1}{\\mu_5 - \\lambda} = \\frac{1}{40 - 30} = \\frac{1}{10} \\text{ days}$$\n\n**Analysis of Periodic Gating Stages (Stages 4 and 6)**\n\nStages $4$ and $6$ are not continuous service queues but are periodic processes. An item arriving at such a stage must wait for the next scheduled event.\n\nFor a process with events occurring at fixed intervals of $T$, and arrivals occurring according to a Poisson process, a fundamental result from renewal theory (often related to the inspection paradox) states that the expected waiting time from an arbitrary arrival until the next event is $\\frac{T}{2}$. The total time in the stage is this waiting time plus the duration of the activity itself.\n\n- **Stage 4 (Governance review):**\nMeetings occur periodically every $T_g = 7$ days. The expected waiting time for the next meeting is $\\frac{T_g}{2}$. The average duration of the meeting (service time) is given as $t_g = 0.5$ days. The total expected time in this stage is:\n$$E[T_4] = \\frac{T_g}{2} + t_g = \\frac{7}{2} + 0.5 = 3.5 + 0.5 = 4 \\text{ days}$$\n\n- **Stage 6 (Clinician training):**\nTraining sessions occur periodically every $T_a = 14$ days. The expected waiting time for the next session is $\\frac{T_a}{2}$. The duration of the training is $t_a = 1$ day. The total expected time in this stage is:\n$$E[T_6] = \\frac{T_a}{2} + t_a = \\frac{14}{2} + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8 \\text{ days}$$\n\n**Total Expected Cycle Time**\n\nThe closed-form expression for the total expected cycle time is the sum of the expected times in each stage:\n$$E[T_{\\text{total}}] = \\frac{1}{\\mu_1 - \\lambda} + \\frac{1}{\\mu_2 - \\lambda} + \\frac{1}{\\mu_3 - \\lambda} + \\left(\\frac{T_g}{2} + t_g\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\mu_5 - \\lambda} + \\left(\\frac{T_a}{2} + t_a\\right)$$\nSubstituting the derived values:\n$$E[T_{\\text{total}}] = E[T_1] + E[T_2] + E[T_3] + E[T_4] + E[T_5] + E[T_6]$$\n$$E[T_{\\text{total}}] = \\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{2} + 4 + \\frac{1}{10} + 8$$\nTo sum the fractional parts, we find a common denominator, which is $30$:\n$$E[T_{\\text{total}}] = \\left(\\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{5}{30} + \\frac{15}{30} + \\frac{3}{30}\\right) + 4 + 8$$\n$$E[T_{\\text{total}}] = \\frac{1 + 5 + 15 + 3}{30} + 12 = \\frac{24}{30} + 12$$\n$$E[T_{\\text{total}}] = \\frac{4}{5} + 12 = 0.8 + 12 = 12.8 \\text{ days}$$\n\n**Bottleneck Analysis**\n\nA bottleneck is a stage that disproportionately contributes to the total cycle time or has a high utilization, thus limiting the overall \"learning velocity.\" We analyze this based on both delay contribution and utilization.\n\n1.  **Delay Contribution:**\n    - $E[T_1] \\approx 0.033$ days\n    - $E[T_2] \\approx 0.167$ days\n    - $E[T_3] = 0.5$ days\n    - $E[T_4] = 4.0$ days\n    - $E[T_5] = 0.1$ days\n    - $E[T_6] = 8.0$ days\n    - Total = $12.8$ days\n\n    The stages with the largest contributions to the total delay are **Stage 6 (Clinician training)**, contributing $8$ days ($62.5\\%$ of the total time), and **Stage 4 (Governance review)**, contributing $4$ days ($31.25\\%$ of the total time). These two stages together account for $12$ of the $12.8$ days, or over $93\\%$ of the entire cycle time. The bottleneck effect here is caused by the long periodic waiting times ($T_a/2 = 7$ days and $T_g/2 = 3.5$ days).\n\n2.  **Utilization Analysis for M/M/1 Stages:**\n    The utilization, $\\rho_i = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu_i}$, measures how busy a service stage is. As $\\rho_i \\to 1$, the queue length and waiting time grow non-linearly toward infinity, making the stage a critical point of failure.\n    - $\\rho_1 = \\frac{30}{60} = 0.5$\n    - $\\rho_2 = \\frac{30}{36} = \\frac{5}{6} \\approx 0.833$\n    - $\\rho_3 = \\frac{30}{32} = \\frac{15}{16} = 0.9375$\n    - $\\rho_5 = \\frac{30}{40} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$\n\n    Among the M/M/1 queues, **Stage 3 (Analysis)** has the highest utilization at $\\rho_3 = 0.9375$. This means it is operating very close to its capacity. While its current delay contribution ($0.5$ days) is much smaller than that of the gating stages, its high utilization makes it the most significant bottleneck among the continuous service processes. Any small increase in the arrival rate $\\lambda$ would cause a large increase in the delay at Stage 3, and it is the first M/M/1 stage that would become unstable if the arrival rate were to increase past $32$ items/day.\n\n**Conclusion on Bottlenecks:**\nThe primary bottlenecks that limit the hospital's learning velocity are the periodically scheduled stages: **Stage 6 (Clinician training)** and **Stage 4 (Governance review)**, due to their substantial contribution to the total cycle time. Among the process-driven stages, **Stage 3 (Analysis)** is a critical bottleneck due to its high utilization, making the system's performance highly sensitive to its capacity.\n\nThe final numerical answer for the expected total cycle time is requested.\n$$E[T_{\\text{total}}] = 12.8 \\text{ days}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12.8}$$", "id": "4861076"}, {"introduction": "The 'learning' in a Learning Health System is an active, iterative process.

The clinical team defines a gold standard by retrospective chart review to determine when an alert would have been clinically appropriate (positives) versus inappropriate (negatives). For each period, a cohort of relevant prescribing sessions is assembled, and every alert is adjudicated as a true positive or false positive; missed positives are counted as false negatives based on gold-standard positives.\n\nPre-fix (baseline) period:\n- Total relevant prescribing sessions reviewed: $N_{0} = 5{,}000$.\n- Gold-standard positives (cases warranting an alert): $P_{0} = 300$.\n- Alerts fired: $A_{0} = 1{,}500$.\n- Of these, true positives: $TP_{0} = 120$, false positives: $FP_{0} = 1{,}380$.\n- Consequently, false negatives: $FN_{0} = P_{0} - TP_{0}$.\n\nPost-fix period (after implementing refined trigger logic and context-specific suppression based on the RCA plan; prevalence assumed stable across periods):\n- Total relevant prescribing sessions reviewed: $N_{1} = 5{,}200$.\n- Gold-standard positives: $P_{1} = 300$.\n- Alerts fired: $A_{1} = 400$.\n- Of these, true positives: $TP_{1} = 150$, false positives: $FP_{1} = 250$.\n- Consequently, false negatives: $FN_{1} = P_{1} - TP_{1}$.\n\nTask A (RCA design): Briefly outline the core components of a Root Cause Analysis within an LHS framework to diagnose causes of high overrides for this CDS.

Do not include any units in your final answer.", "solution": "The solution will be presented in two parts, corresponding to the two tasks outlined in the problem.\n\n**Task A: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Design**\n\nA rigorous Root Cause Analysis is essential to move beyond simply noting the high override rate and to diagnose the underlying systemic issues contributing to poor alert performance. Within the LHS framework, the RCA serves as the \"Study\" phase of a Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle, generating specific, actionable hypotheses for the next \"Plan\" phase. The core components of such an RCA are outlined below.\n\nThe central goal is to understand the drivers of the high number of false positives ($FP_{0} = 1{,}380$) and the significant number of false negatives ($FN_{0} = 180$), which manifest as alert fatigue, high override rates, and missed safety opportunities. The analysis must be multi-dimensional, interrogating various aspects of the clinical decision support (CDS) system and its interaction with the clinical environment.\n\n1.  **Knowledge Base and Evidence Review**: The foundation of any CDS alert is its knowledge base.\n    -   **Dimensions**: Currency of evidence, accuracy of interaction severity, and applicability of the knowledge to the local patient population.\n    -   **Data Sources**: The DDI knowledge database itself must be audited against current, authoritative pharmacological compendia (e.g., Lexicomp, Micromedex) and primary literature. A review of a sample of $FP_{0}$ alerts may reveal that the underlying DDI definition is outdated or considered clinically insignificant by current standards. For instance, an interaction may be based on theoretical mechanisms with little clinical evidence of harm.\n    -   **Connection to PDSA**: Findings could lead to updating, removing, or re-classifying specific DDI rules in the knowledge base.\n\n2.  **Trigger Logic and Context Specificity**: Poorly specified trigger logic is a primary cause of low precision.\n    -   **Dimensions**: Overly generic triggers that lack patient-specific or clinical context. This includes failing to account for administration routes (e.g., topical vs. systemic), dosing, duration of therapy, or patient lab values (e.g., renal function).\n    -   **Data Sources**: Deep-dive chart reviews of a statistically significant sample of $FP_{0}$ cases. For each case, structured data from the Electronic Health Record (EHR)—such as medication orders, lab results, and patient demographics—should be analyzed to identify patterns. For example, analysis may show that $70\\%$ of $FP_{0}$ alerts for a specific DDI occur when one drug is topical and the other is oral, an interaction with negligible systemic risk.\n    -   **Connection to PDSA**: This analysis directly informs the refinement of the alert's triggering algorithm. The \"Do\" phase could involve implementing more complex rules, such as \"suppress alert if drug A is topical\" or \"fire alert only if potassium level is  $5.0$ mmol/L.\"\n\n3.  **Workflow Integration and Timing**: An alert's effectiveness is highly dependent on when and how it is presented to the user.\n    -   **Dimensions**: Point in the workflow (e.g., during order entry vs. at order signing), cognitive load on the clinician at the time of the alert, and interruption appropriateness.\n    -   **Data Sources**: Direct observation of clinicians (ethnographic methods), \"think-aloud\" usability testing where clinicians verbalize their thoughts while interacting with the system, and analysis of system audit logs to reconstruct the sequence of user actions leading to an alert and subsequent override.\n    -   **Connection to PDSA**: Insights could lead to changes in the alert's presentation, such as deferring less critical alerts to a summary view or changing the trigger event from \"order creation\" to \"order sign-off.\"\n\n4.  **User Interface (UI) and Information Display**: If the alert is confusing or difficult to interpret, it will be ignored regardless of its validity.\n    -   **Dimensions**: Clarity of the information presented, actionability of the recommendations, and ease of response. High information density or a lack of a clear \"what to do next\" recommendation contributes to overrides.\n    -   **Data Sources**: Heuristic evaluation of the alert's UI by human factors experts, surveys and interviews with end-users to gather qualitative feedback on alert design, and A/B testing of alternative display formats.\n    -   **Connection to PDSA**: This leads to redesigning the UI for clarity and conciseness, for example, by using graphical elements to show risk level or by providing one-click alternative medication suggestions.\n\nBy systematically investigating these dimensions, the LHS team can formulate specific, evidence-based interventions. The success of these interventions is then measured in a subsequent \"Study\" phase, as demonstrated in Task B.\n\n**Task B: Metrics Computation**\n\nThe performance of the CDS alert is quantified using standard information retrieval metrics: precision, recall, and the $F_{1}$ score.\n\nThe fundamental definitions are:\n-   Precision ($Pr$): The fraction of retrieved instances that are relevant. $Pr = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}$.\n-   Recall ($Re$), or sensitivity: The fraction of relevant instances that are retrieved. $Re = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} = \\frac{TP}{P}$.\n-   $F_{1}$ score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall. $F_{1} = 2 \\times \\frac{Pr \\times Re}{Pr + Re}$.\n\n**Pre-Fix (Baseline) Period Metrics:**\n\nThe givens are $TP_{0} = 120$, $FP_{0} = 1{,}380$, and $P_{0} = 300$.\nFirst, the number of false negatives ($FN_{0}$) is calculated from the total number of gold-standard positives ($P_{0}$) and true positives ($TP_{0}$):\n$$FN_{0} = P_{0} - TP_{0} = 300 - 120 = 180$$\nNow, we compute precision ($Pr_{0}$) and recall ($Re_{0}$):\n$$Pr_{0} = \\frac{TP_{0}}{TP_{0} + FP_{0}} = \\frac{120}{120 + 1{,}380} = \\frac{120}{1{,}500} = 0.08$$\n$$Re_{0} = \\frac{TP_{0}}{TP_{0} + FN_{0}} = \\frac{120}{120 + 180} = \\frac{120}{300} = 0.4$$\nThe baseline $F_{1}$ score ($F_{1, \\text{pre}}$) is:\n$$F_{1, \\text{pre}} = 2 \\times \\frac{Pr_{0} \\times Re_{0}}{Pr_{0} + Re_{0}} = 2 \\times \\frac{0.08 \\times 0.4}{0.08 + 0.4} = 2 \\times \\frac{0.032}{0.48} = \\frac{0.064}{0.48} = \\frac{2}{15}$$\n\n**Post-Fix Period Metrics:**\n\nThe givens are $TP_{1} = 150$, $FP_{1} = 250$, and $P_{1} = 300$.\nFirst, the number of false negatives ($FN_{1}$) is calculated:\n$$FN_{1} = P_{1} - TP_{1} = 300 - 150 = 150$$\nNow, we compute precision ($Pr_{1}$) and recall ($Re_{1}$):\n$$Pr_{1} = \\frac{TP_{1}}{TP_{1} + FP_{1}} = \\frac{150}{150 + 250} = \\frac{150}{400} = 0.375$$\n$$Re_{1} = \\frac{TP_{1}}{TP_{1} + FN_{1}} = \\frac{150}{150 + 150} = \\frac{150}{300} = 0.5$$\nThe post-fix $F_{1}$ score ($F_{1, \\text{post}}$) is:\n$$F_{1, \\text{post}} = 2 \\times \\frac{Pr_{1} \\times Re_{1}}{Pr_{1} + Re_{1}} = 2 \\times \\frac{0.375 \\times 0.5}{0.375 + 0.5} = 2 \\times \\frac{0.1875}{0.875} = \\frac{0.375}{0.875} = \\frac{3}{7}$$\n\n**Absolute Improvement in $F_{1}$ Score:**\n\nThe final calculation is the absolute improvement, defined as the difference between the post-fix and pre-fix $F_{1}$ scores.\n$$\\Delta F_{1} = F_{1, \\text{post}} - F_{1, \\text{pre}} = \\frac{3}{7} - \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{3 \\times 15}{7 \\times 15} - \\frac{2 \\times 7}{15 \\times 7} = \\frac{45 - 14}{105} = \\frac{31}{105}$$\nTo provide a numerical answer, we compute the decimal value:\n$$\\frac{31}{105} \\approx 0.295238095...$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required by the problem statement yields $0.2952$.\nThis positive change indicates a substantial improvement in the overall performance of the CDS alert, balancing the gains in precision (fewer false alarms) and recall (capturing more true events).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2952}$$", "id": "4861105"}]}
