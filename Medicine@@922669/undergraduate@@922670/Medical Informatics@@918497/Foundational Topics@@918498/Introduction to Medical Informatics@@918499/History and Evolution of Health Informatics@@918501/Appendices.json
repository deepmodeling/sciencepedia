This exercise transports us back to the 1970s, an era where every byte of data was a precious commodity. By calculating the storage requirements for a minimal patient record on a period-typical minicomputer, you will gain a tangible understanding of why early electronic health records were so limited in scope and how these hardware boundaries fundamentally shaped the initial design of health information systems [@problem_id:4843231].", "problem": "In the early era of health information systems around $1970$, minicomputers typically constrained data architectures in hospital environments. Consider a system with $64$ kilobytes (kilobyte, KB) of random access memory and a $2$ megabyte (megabyte, MB) fixed disk. A historically plausible minimal longitudinal patient record is to store, per patient, core demographics and a small panel of laboratory results: demographics occupy $100$ bytes, and there are $20$ laboratory results, each consisting of an $8$-byte numeric value and $12$ bytes of metadata.\n\nUsing the canonical binary definitions widely used in that period, take $1$ KB to be $1024$ bytes and $1$ MB to be $1024$ KB. Let the system be provisioned for $10{,}000$ patients and assume no additional filesystem overhead beyond the stated field sizes.\n\nStarting from these base definitions and the stated record structure, derive the per-patient storage requirement and the total storage required for $10{,}000$ patients. Then, define the disk utilization ratio $r$ by\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\text{total required bytes}}{\\text{available disk bytes}}.\n$$\nCompute $r$ as a unitless decimal and round your final value to four significant figures.

The ratio is defined as:\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\text{total required bytes}}{\\text{available disk bytes}}\n$$\nThis requires three main steps:\n1.  Calculate the storage requirement for a single patient record.\n2.  Calculate the total storage requirement for the entire patient population.\n3.  Calculate the total available disk storage in bytes.\n\nFirst, we determine the per-patient storage requirement, denoted as $S_{patient}$. A single patient record consists of demographics and laboratory results.\nThe storage for demographics, $S_{demo}$, is given as $100$ bytes.\n$$S_{demo} = 100 \\text{ bytes}$$\nThe patient record also includes $N_{lab} = 20$ laboratory results. Each result consists of an $8$-byte numeric value and $12$ bytes of metadata. The storage for a single laboratory result, $S_{lab}$, is the sum of these two values:\n$$S_{lab} = 8 \\text{ bytes} + 12 \\text{ bytes} = 20 \\text{ bytes}$$\nThe total storage for all laboratory results for one patient, $S_{labs\\_total}$, is the number of results multiplied by the storage per result:\n$$S_{labs\\_total} = N_{lab} \\times S_{lab} = 20 \\times 20 \\text{ bytes} = 400 \\text{ bytes}$$\nThe total storage per patient, $S_{patient}$, is the sum of the storage for demographics and the total for laboratory results:\n$$S_{patient} = S_{demo} + S_{labs\\_total} = 100 \\text{ bytes} + 400 \\text{ bytes} = 500 \\text{ bytes}$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the total required storage, $S_{req}$, for the specified population of $N_{patients} = 10000$ patients. This is calculated by multiplying the number of patients by the storage requirement per patient.\n$$S_{req} = N_{patients} \\times S_{patient} = 10000 \\times 500 \\text{ bytes} = 5,000,000 \\text{ bytes}$$\n\nThird, we determine the available disk storage in bytes, $S_{avail}$. The disk size is given as $2$ MB. The problem specifies the use of canonical binary definitions: $1$ KB $= 1024$ bytes and $1$ MB $= 1024$ KB. We convert the available disk space from megabytes to bytes:\n$$S_{avail} = 2 \\text{ MB}$$\n$$S_{avail} = 2 \\times 1024 \\text{ KB}$$\n$$S_{avail} = 2 \\times 1024 \\times 1024 \\text{ bytes}$$\nTo simplify the calculation, we can express $1024$ as $2^{10}$:\n$$S_{avail} = 2 \\times (2^{10}) \\times (2^{10}) = 2^{1} \\times 2^{10} \\times 2^{10} = 2^{1+10+10} = 2^{21} \\text{ bytes}$$\nEvaluating this expression gives the total number of available bytes:\n$$S_{avail} = 2,097,152 \\text{ bytes}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the disk utilization ratio $r$ by dividing the total required storage by the total available storage.\n$$r = \\frac{S_{req}}{S_{avail}} = \\frac{5,000,000}{2,097,152}$$\nPerforming the division yields:\n$$r \\approx 2.384185791$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

So,\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T)}$$\nThis is Bayes' theorem. The denominator, $P(T)$, can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nWe are given $P(T|D) = \\text{Sens}$ and $P(D) = \\text{Prev}$.\nFrom the axioms of probability, $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - \\text{Prev}$.\nAlso, $P(T|D^c)$ is the probability of a positive test given no disease, which is the false positive rate. This can be expressed in terms of specificity:\n$$P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - \\text{Spec}$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(T)$:\n$$P(T) = (\\text{Sens} \\times \\text{Prev}) + ((1 - \\text{Spec}) \\times (1 - \\text{Prev}))$$\nFinally, substituting this back into the expression for PPV:\n$$\\text{PPV} = P(D|T) = \\frac{\\text{Sens} \\times \\text{Prev}}{(\\text{Sens} \\times \\text{Prev}) + ((1 - \\text{Spec}) \\times (1 - \\text{Prev}))}$$\n\n**Derivation of NPV:**\nSimilarly, for NPV:\n$$\\text{NPV} = P(D^c|T^c) = \\frac{P(D^c \\cap T^c)}{P(T^c)} = \\frac{P(T^c|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T^c)}$$\nThe denominator is expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^c) = P(T^c|D^c)P(D^c) + P(T^c|D)P(D)$$\nWe are given $P(T^c|D^c) = \\text{Spec}$.\nWe have $P(D^c) = 1 - \\text{Prev}$.\nThe term $P(T^c|D)$ is the probability of a negative test given the disease, which is the false negative rate.
