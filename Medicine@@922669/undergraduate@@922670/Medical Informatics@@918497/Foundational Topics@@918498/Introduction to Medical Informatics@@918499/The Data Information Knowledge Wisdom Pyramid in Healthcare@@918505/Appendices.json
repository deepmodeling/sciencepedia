Focus on the contribution of serum sodium concentration to the risk score.\n\nAssume the true serum sodium for a random patient, denoted by $X$, follows a normal distribution with mean $\\mu = 140$ millimoles per liter and standard deviation $\\sigma = 4$ millimoles per liter. The model uses a standardized sodium feature $Z = (X - \\mu)/\\sigma$ with a linear coefficient $\\beta$ in the risk score; that is, the sodium-only contribution to the risk score is $S_{\\text{true}} = \\beta Z$. Suppose $\\beta = 0.6$ risk-score units per standard deviation. Other features in the score are independent of $X$ and are not affected by the data quality issues described below.\n\nSuppose the data pipeline has two mutually exclusive data quality issues affecting sodium measurements:\n- A fraction $p_{m} = 0.10$ of records are missing and are imputed by the sample mean $\\mu$ before standardization.\n- A fraction $p_{u} = 0.02$ of records are recorded in milligrams per deciliter but mislabeled and processed as if in millimoles per liter, so the numeric value is erroneously scaled by a constant factor $k = \\frac{23}{10}$ before standardization. All remaining records are processed correctly.

The problem is objective and free of ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe quantity to be calculated is the mean squared error, $\\mathrm{MSE}$, defined as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSE} = \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[(S_{\\text{hat}} - S_{\\text{true}})^{2}\\right]\n$$\nFirst, we express the difference $S_{\\text{hat}} - S_{\\text{true}}$ in terms of the underlying variables:\n$$\nS_{\\text{hat}} - S_{\\text{true}} = \\beta \\frac{X_{\\text{obs}} - \\mu}{\\sigma} - \\beta \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\sigma} (X_{\\text{obs}} - X)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the MSE definition, we get:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSE} = \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{\\sigma} (X_{\\text{obs}} - X)\\right)^{2}\\right] = \\frac{\\beta^2}{\\sigma^2} \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[(X_{\\text{obs}} - X)^{2}\\right]\n$$\nThe core of the problem is to compute the expectation $\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[(X_{\\text{obs}} - X)^{2}\\right]$. We use the law of total expectation, conditioning on the three mutually exclusive events describing the data processing:\n1.  $E_c$: The record is correct.\n2.  $E_m$: The record is missing and imputed.\n3.  $E_u$: The record has a unit error.\n\nThe probabilities of these events are given or can be deduced:\n- $P(E_m) = p_m = 0.10$\n- $P(E_u) = p_u = 0.02$\n- $P(E_c) = p_c = 1 - p_m - p_u = 1 - 0.10 - 0.02 = 0.88$\n\nBy the law of total expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[(X_{\\text{obs}} - X)^{2}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[(X_{\\text{obs}} - X)^{2} | E_c\\right] p_c + \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[(X_{\\text{obs}} - X)^{2} | E_m\\right] p_m + \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[(X_{\\text{obs}} - X)^{2} | E_u\\right] p_u\n$$\nWe evaluate each conditional expectation:\n\nCase 1: Correct record ($E_c$).\nHere, $X_{\\text{obs}} = X$. The error is $X_{\\text{obs}} - X = 0$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[(X_{\\text{obs}} - X)^{2} | E_c\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[0^2\\right] = 0\n$$\n\nCase 2: Missing record ($E_m$).\nThe value is imputed by the mean, so $X_{\\text{obs}} = \\mu$. The error is $X_{\\text{obs}} - X = \\mu - X$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[(X_{\\text{obs}} - X)^{2} | E_m\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[(\\mu - X)^{2} | E_m\\right]\n$$\nDue to the MCAR assumption, the distribution of $X$ is independent of the event $E_m$. Thus, the expectation is simply the variance of $X$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[(\\mu - X)^{2}\\right] = \\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\sigma^2\n$$\n\nCase 3: Unit error ($E_u$).\nThe value is erroneously scaled, so $X_{\\text{obs}} = kX$. The error is $X_{\\text{obs}} - X = kX - X = (k-1)X$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[(X_{\\text{obs}} - X)^{2} | E_u\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[((k-1)X)^{2} | E_u\\right] = (k-1)^2 \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[X^2 | E_u\\right]\n$$\nAgain, by independence, $\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[X^2 | E_u\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[X^2\\right]$. We know that $\\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[X^2\\right] - (\\mathbb{E}[X])^2$, which implies $\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[X^2\\right] = \\mathrm{Var}(X) + (\\mathbb{E}[X])^2 = \\sigma^2 + \\mu^2$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[(X_{\\text{obs}} - X)^{2} | E_u\\right] = (k-1)^2 (\\sigma^2 + \\mu^2)\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute these back into the law of total expectation formula:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[(X_{\\text{obs}} - X)^{2}\\right] = (0) \\cdot p_c + (\\sigma^2) \\cdot p_m + (k-1)^2 (\\sigma^2 + \\mu^2) \\cdot p_u\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[(X_{\\text{obs}} - X)^{2}\\right] = p_m \\sigma^2 + p_u (k-1)^2 (\\sigma^2 + \\mu^2)\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this into the expression for MSE:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSE} = \\frac{\\beta^2}{\\sigma^2} \\left[ p_m \\sigma^2 + p_u (k-1)^2 (\\sigma^2 + \\mu^2) \\right]\n$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the final closed-form equation for the MSE:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSE} = \\beta^2 \\left[ p_m + p_u (k-1)^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{\\mu^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nWe substitute the given values into the derived formula:\n$\\beta = 0.6$, $p_m = 0.10$, $p_u = 0.02$, $k = \\frac{23}{10} = 2.3$, $\\mu = 140$, $\\sigma = 4$.\n\nFirst, we compute the components of the expression:\n- $\\beta^2 = (0.6)^2 = 0.36$\n- $k-1 = 2.3 - 1 = 1.3$\n- $(k-1)^2 = (1.3)^2 = 1.69$\n- The ratio of the mean to the standard deviation is $\\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{140}{4} = 35$.\n- The squared ratio is $\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2 = 35^2 = 1225$.\n- The term $\\left(1 + \\frac{\\mu^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right) = 1 + 1225 = 1226$.\n\nNow, substitute these values into the MSE formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSE} = 0.36 \\left[ 0.10 + (0.02) \\cdot (1.69) \\cdot (1226) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSE} = 0.36 \\left[ 0.10 + 41.4388 \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSE} = 0.36 \\left[ 41.5388 \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSE} = 14.953968\n$$\nRounding the final result to four significant figures, we get $14.95$. The units are risk-score units squared.\n\n### Proposed Correction Plan\nTo correct these errors, the data pipeline should implement an automated validation rule to flag sodium values outside a plausible physiological range (e.g., $100$ to $180$ mmol/L) to detect and manage likely unit errors, and it should replace simple mean imputation with a more advanced statistical technique like multiple imputation to provide more reliable estimates for missing data.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{14.95}$$", "id": "4860506"}, {"introduction": "After appreciating the need for data quality, the next step is to synthesize structured information into actionable knowledge.

In this problem, it is the error of judging the meaning of a test result based only on the test's characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) while ignoring the prevalence of the disease in the population being tested.\n\nThe calculations at the knowledge level provide a stark illustration of this fallacy. The assay has excellent data-level characteristics: sensitivity of $0.95$ and specificity of $0.98$. One might naively believe that a positive test strongly implies the presence of disease. However, wisdom requires understanding that the value of this information is highly context-dependent. In the low-prevalence screening context ($p_L = 0.002$), the posterior probability of disease given a positive test ($PPV_L$) is only about $0.087$, or $8.7\\%$. This means over $91\\%$ of positive results in this setting are false positives. Ignoring the low base rate leads to a dramatic overestimation of a patient's risk and could lead to unnecessary anxiety and invasive, costly follow-up procedures. Conversely, in the high-prevalence referral clinic ($p_H = 0.20$), the same test yields a $PPV_H$ of about $0.922$, or $92.2\\%$, making a positive result a much more reliable indicator of disease. The transition from data (test characteristics) to wisdom is the recognition that the interpretation and appropriate clinical action depend critically on the prior probability established by the clinical context.\n\nFinal Quantitative Comparison:\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the $PPV$ in the high-prevalence context to the $PPV$ in the low-prevalence context.\n$$Ratio = \\frac{PPV_H}{PPV_L} = \\frac{\\frac{0.19}{0.206}}{\\frac{0.0019}{0.02186}} \\approx \\frac{0.9223301}{0.0869167} \\approx 10.61166$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio is $10.61$.
