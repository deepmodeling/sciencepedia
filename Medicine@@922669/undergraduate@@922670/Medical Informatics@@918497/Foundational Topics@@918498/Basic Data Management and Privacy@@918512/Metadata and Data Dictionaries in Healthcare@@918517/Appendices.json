The data dictionary defines the following core concepts and mappings: (i) metadata tag semantics are modeled as attribute-value constraints, (ii) research domains are elements of a controlled vocabulary, and (iii) Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) rules compare dataset attributes and requester attributes. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) is defined as a decision model in which the authorization outcome depends on evaluating logical predicates over attributes of the requester and the resource, using the semantics supplied by the metadata and its data dictionary.\n\nThe controlled vocabulary for research domain is a finite set $$\\mathcal{D} = \\{\\text{Cardiology}, \\text{Oncology}, \\text{Neurology}, \\dots\\},$$ where elements are disjoint according to the data dictionary, meaning that for any distinct $d_{1}, d_{2} \\in \\mathcal{D}$ with $d_{1} \\neq d_{2},$ the intersection of their semantic extents is empty.

It provides a self-contained, consistent set of definitions and data from which a logical deduction can be made. The task is to formalize an Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) decision and compute its outcome.\n\nThe core of an ABAC model is the evaluation of a logical policy rule. The policy determines access based on attributes of the requester (subject), the resource (object), and the environment. In this problem, we are concerned with requester and resource attributes.\n\nLet $U$ be the requester and $R$ be the resource (dataset). The problem provides the following attributes:\n\nFor the resource $R$, the consent tag \"cardiology research only\" is mapped to two attribute sets:\n- The set of allowed research domains: $A_{D}(R) = \\{\\text{Cardiology}\\}$\n- The set of allowed purpose types: $A_{T}(R) = \\{\\text{Research}\\}$\n\nFor the requester $U$, the declared purpose-of-use is given as a tuple $P(U) = (\\text{domain} = \\text{Oncology}, \\text{type} = \\text{Research})$. From this, we extract the requester's attributes:\n- The requester's intended domain: $d_{U} = \\text{Oncology}$\n- The requester's intended purpose type: $t_{U} = \\text{Research}$\n\nThe ABAC decision rule must compare the requester's attributes against the resource's allowed attributes. Access is typically granted only if all conditions specified by the resource's policy are met by the requester. This corresponds to a logical conjunction (AND operation) of individual attribute checks.\n\nWe are asked to model the decision as a numeric function of set membership and Boolean conjunction. Let the access decision be represented by a real-valued indicator $d \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, where $d=1$ signifies \"allow\" and $d=0$ signifies \"deny.\"\n\nThe logical predicate for allowing access, let's call it $P_{\\text{allow}}$, can be stated as: The requester's intended domain must be in the set of allowed domains, AND the requester's intended purpose type must be in the set of allowed purpose types.\nIn formal terms:\n$$P_{\\text{allow}} \\equiv (d_{U} \\in A_{D}(R)) \\land (t_{U} \\in A_{T}(R))$$\n\nTo convert this logical predicate into a numeric value $d$, we can use an indicator function $I(X)$, which is defined as $1$ if the proposition $X$ is true, and $0$ if $X$ is false. The decision $d$ is the value of the indicator function for the predicate $P_{\\text{allow}}$:\n$$d = I(P_{\\text{allow}}) = I((d_{U} \\in A_{D}(R)) \\land (t_{U} \\in A_{T}(R)))$$\n\nA fundamental property of indicator functions is that the indicator of a logical conjunction is the product of the indicators of the individual propositions. Therefore, we can write $d$ as:\n$$d = I(d_{U} \\in A_{D}(R)) \\times I(t_{U} \\in A_{T}(R))$$\n\nNow we can compute the value of $d$ by substituting the given attributes.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate the domain condition: $d_{U} \\in A_{D}(R)$.\n- $d_{U} = \\text{Oncology}$\n- $A_{D}(R) = \\{\\text{Cardiology}\\}$\nThe question is whether $\\text{Oncology} \\in \\{\\text{Cardiology}\\}$. Since $\\text{Oncology} \\neq \\text{Cardiology}$, the element is not a member of the set. The proposition is false.\n- Therefore, $I(d_{U} \\in A_{D}(R)) = 0$.\n\nSecond, let's evaluate the purpose-type condition: $t_{U} \\in A_{T}(R)$.\n- $t_{U} = \\text{Research}$\n- $A_{T}(R) = \\{\\text{Research}\\}$\nThe question is whether $\\text{Research} \\in \\{\\text{Research}\\}$. This is true, as the element is a member of the set.\n- Therefore, $I(t_{U} \\in A_{T}(R)) = 1$.\n\nFinally, we compute the overall decision $d$ by multiplying the results of the individual evaluations:\n$$d = 0 \\times 1$$\n$$d = 0$$\n\nThe result $d=0$ signifies that access is denied. This is because the request fails the domain check, and the conjunctive nature of the ABAC rule requires all conditions to be satisfied for access to be granted. The fact that the purpose-type matches is insufficient to override the domain mismatch.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "4848636"}, {"introduction": "Healthcare data is generated globally, leading to variations in units of measure that can pose serious risks to patient safety if not handled correctly.

The conversion from $\\text{mg}$ to $\\text{g}$ ($10^{-3}$) and from $\\text{mol}$ to $\\text{mmol}$ ($10^3$) cancel each other.
