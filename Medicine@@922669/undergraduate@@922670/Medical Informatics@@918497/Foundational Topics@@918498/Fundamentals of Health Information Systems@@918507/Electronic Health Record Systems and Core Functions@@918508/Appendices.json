Let $B_i$ be a random variable for the $i$-th order, where $B_i=1$ if an alert is triggered and $B_i=0$ otherwise. The probability of success for each trial is $p$.\n$$B_i \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p)$$\nThe expected value of a single Bernoulli trial is $E[B_i] = 1 \\cdot p + 0 \\cdot (1-p) = p$.\nThe total number of alerts is the sum $X_A = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} B_i$. By the linearity of expectation, the expected number of alerts is:\n$$E[A] = E[X_A] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} B_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[B_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p = np$$\nThis is the well-known formula for the expectation of a binomial distribution, $X_A \\sim \\text{Bin}(n,p)$.\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$E[A] = (750)(0.18) = 135$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get $135.0$.\n\n2) Expected number of overrides $E[O]$:\nAn override for a given order occurs if an alert is triggered (probability $p$) AND the clinician does not accept it. The probability of non-acceptance (override), given an alert has fired, is $1-a$.\nLet $O_i$ be a random variable for the $i$-th order, where $O_i=1$ if an override occurs and $O_i=0$ otherwise. The probability of an override for a single order is the product of the probabilities of these two events:\n$$P(O_i=1) = P(\\text{alert for order } i) \\times P(\\text{override | alert for order } i) = p(1-a)$$\nThe total number of overrides, $X_O$, is the sum of $n$ independent Bernoulli trials $O_i$, each with success probability $p(1-a)$.\n$$X_O = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} O_i$$\nBy linearity of expectation:\n$$E[O] = E[X_O] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} O_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[O_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p(1-a) = np(1-a)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$E[O] = (750)(0.18)(1 - 0.12) = 135(0.88) = 118.8$$\nThis value is already given to four significant figures.\n\n3) Alert fatigue risk threshold $m^{\\ast}$:\nWe need to find the smallest integer $m^{\\ast}$ such that $P(X_A \\le m^{\\ast}) \\ge 1 - r = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\nThe number of alerts $X_A$ follows a binomial distribution, $X_A \\sim \\text{Bin}(n=750, p=0.18)$.

The diagnosis chapter for these $2$ records is suppressed:\n    $([40,49], \\text{M}, z_{021}, Q_{2}, \\text{L}) \\rightarrow ([40,49], \\text{M}, z_{021}, Q_{2}, \\star)$.\n\nAfter this suppression step, we recompute the equivalence classes based on the new quasi-identifier tuple $(g_{\\text{age}}(a), s, z_{3}, q, d')$, where $d'$ is the post-suppression diagnosis marker.\n\nThe classes that were not subject to suppression remain as they are:\n-   Class $C'_1 = ([30,39], \\text{F}, z_{021}, Q_{1}, \\text{E})$ with frequency $|C'_1| = 4$.\n-   Class $C'_2 = ([30,39], \\text{F}, z_{021}, Q_{1}, \\text{I})$ with frequency $|C'_2| = 3$.\n-   Class $C'_3 = ([40,49], \\text{M}, z_{021}, Q_{2}, \\text{J})$ with frequency $|C'_3| = 3$.\n\nThe suppressed records are now regrouped.\n-   The $2$ records from $C_3$ and the $1$ record from $C_4$ are all transformed to have the QI tuple $([30,39], \\text{F}, z_{021}, Q_{1}, \\star)$. These records now form a new equivalence class.\n    Class $C'_4 = ([30,39], \\text{F}, z_{021}, Q_{1}, \\star)$.\n    Its frequency is the sum of the frequencies of the original classes that were merged into it: $|C'_4| = |C_3| + |C_4| = 2 + 1 = 3$.\n-   Similarly, the $1$ record from $C_6$ and the $2$ records from $C_7$ are transformed to have the QI tuple $([40,49], \\text{M}, z_{021}, Q_{2}, \\star)$. These records form another new equivalence class.\n    Class $C'_5 = ([40,49], \\text{M}, z_{021}, Q_{2}, \\star)$.\n    Its frequency is $|C'_5| = |C_6| + |C_7| = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nThe final set of equivalence classes and their frequencies is:\n-   $|C'_1| = 4$\n-   $|C'_2| = 3$\n-   $|C'_3| = 3$\n-   $|C'_4| = 3$\n-   $|C'_5| = 3$\n\nThe total number of records is $4+3+3+3+3 = 16$, which confirms the conservation of records.\n\nThe achieved $k$-anonymity for the dataset is defined as the minimum frequency among all final equivalence classes. We must find the minimum value in the set of frequencies $\\{4, 3, 3, 3, 3\\}$.\n$k = \\min(\\{4, 3, 3, 3, 3\\}) = 3$.\n\nThus, after the de-identification pipeline is applied, the dataset achieves $3$-anonymity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "4837190"}]}
