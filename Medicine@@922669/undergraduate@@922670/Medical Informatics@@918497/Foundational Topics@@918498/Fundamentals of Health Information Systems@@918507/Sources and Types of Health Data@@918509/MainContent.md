## Introduction
In the field of medical informatics, data is the fundamental resource that powers clinical decision support, population health management, and biomedical research. However, health data is not a single, uniform entity; it is a complex and fragmented landscape of information generated from countless sources, each with its own purpose, structure, and quality. Effectively harnessing this data requires a deep understanding of where it comes from, what forms it takes, and the principles that govern its use. This article addresses the critical knowledge gap for aspiring informaticists: how to navigate this diverse data ecosystem to transform raw information into reliable, actionable insights.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter delves into the fundamental principles that govern the generation, structure, and quality of health data. We will deconstruct the major types of data encountered in medical informatics, from records created at the point of care to information generated by patients themselves. Understanding these foundational mechanisms is a prerequisite for any rigorous analysis, as the provenance of data—its origin, context, and purpose—profoundly shapes its strengths, limitations, and potential for bias. We will explore the standards that enable data to be shared and understood across different systems and conclude by examining the critical concepts of data quality, missingness, and bias that every informaticist must master.

### The Ecosystem of Health Data: Sources and Provenance

Health data are not monolithic. They arise from a diverse ecosystem of activities, including clinical care, financial administration, [public health surveillance](@entry_id:170581), and a patient's daily life. A primary organizing principle for classifying this data is its **provenance**: the reason it was created. The purpose for which data are generated dictates its content, structure, granularity, and inherent quality. We will begin by exploring the most significant sources of health data, starting with the records generated directly within the healthcare system.

### Characterizing Clinical Data from the Electronic Health Record

The **Electronic Health Record (EHR)** is the longitudinal digital repository of a patient's health information, generated as a direct consequence of clinical care. The data within an EHR are not uniform; they can be categorized based on whether they represent patient-specific clinical facts, describe the system's structure, or log system interactions.

First and foremost is the **clinical data**, which we can denote as $D_{\text{clinical}}$. This category encompasses all patient-specific information recorded during the process of care delivery. This includes foundational demographic information, records of clinical encounters (such as hospital admissions or clinic visits), physician orders for tests or medications, medication administration records, coded diagnoses and procedures, and direct physiological measurements like vital signs and laboratory results. Crucially, it also includes the narrative documentation written by clinicians, such as progress notes and discharge summaries [@problem_id:4856386]. All these elements—`demographics`, `encounters`, `orders`, `medications`, `diagnoses`, `procedures`, `vitals`, `lab results`, and `notes`—are instances of $D_{\text{clinical}}$ because they encode facts, actions, and observations pertaining to a specific patient at a specific point in time.

Distinct from clinical data is **[metadata](@entry_id:275500)**, or $M_{\text{meta}}$. Metadata is data about the data. It does not describe a particular patient but rather the structure, configuration, and semantics of the EHR system itself. For example, while a specific medication order for a patient is clinical data, the pre-configured "order set" template for a given condition (e.g., community-acquired pneumonia) is [metadata](@entry_id:275500). Other examples include the dictionaries of codes used to record diagnoses, the definitions of fields on a data entry form (a "flowsheet"), and the rules that map one set of codes to another. Metadata provides the scaffold upon which clinical data is built [@problem_id:4856386].

Finally, **audit logs**, or $A_{\text{audit}}$, record system events. These logs do not contain clinical information per se but track the interactions with the data. They answer questions of "who, what, when" regarding data access and modification. Examples include records of user sign-ins, which patient charts were accessed, when an order was modified, and traces of data being written to the database, complete with user identifiers and precise timestamps. Audit logs are essential for security, privacy compliance (e.g., under HIPAA), and understanding data lineage [@problem_id:4856386].

Within the realm of clinical data, a critical distinction exists between **structured** and **unstructured** data.
**Structured data** are elements stored in predefined fields according to a fixed data model. A laboratory result, for instance, is structured: it has a specific field for the test name (e.g., "serum potassium"), a numeric value (e.g., $4.2$), a unit (e.g., "mmol/L"), and a reference range. These discrete fields make the data readily computable.

In contrast, **unstructured data** consists of narrative free-text expressed in natural language without a predefined schema. The most prominent example is the **clinical note**. While notes are essential for communicating clinical reasoning and patient context, their content is not inherently computable and requires advanced techniques like **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to extract structured information. Different types of clinical notes serve distinct purposes, reflected in their typical authorship and structure [@problem_id:4856373]:

*   **Progress Notes**: Authored frequently by bedside clinicians (physicians, nurses, etc.) during an inpatient stay or outpatient visit, these notes capture the day-to-day evolution of a patient's condition. They often follow the **SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan)** format, documenting the patient's reported symptoms, objective findings from exams and tests, the clinician's assessment of the situation, and the intended plan of care.

*   **Radiology Reports**: Authored by radiologists, their purpose is to communicate the findings of an imaging study (like an X-ray or CT scan) to the ordering clinician. They have a conventional structure with sections such as **Indication**, **Technique**, **Findings**, and **Impression**. While the section headings provide a semi-structured format, the core content, especially in the Findings and Impression sections, is narrative free-text.

*   **Discharge Summaries**: Authored by the primary medical team at the conclusion of a hospital admission, these comprehensive documents summarize the entire hospital course. They synthesize the reason for admission, significant findings, procedures performed, hospital trajectory, and provide crucial instructions for the transition of care, including discharge medications and follow-up plans.

### Administrative and Claims Data: The Financial and Operational Lens

While EHRs are created for patient care, another massive source of health data is generated for the purposes of reimbursement and health plan operations. These are broadly known as **administrative and claims data**. Understanding the fundamental difference in their generating incentives is key to their appropriate use [@problem_id:4856391].

The primary incentive behind **claims data** is financial: to obtain payment for services rendered. This has several profound consequences. First, the data are coded according to strict, standardized billing code sets mandated by payers, such as the **International Classification of Diseases (ICD)** for diagnoses, the **Current Procedural Terminology (CPT)** for procedures, and **Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs)** for inpatient billing. Second, the temporal resolution is coarse. A claim records a date of service or an admission/discharge date, but it lacks the minute-by-minute timestamps of clinical events found in an EHR. A claim for a day in the hospital will not contain a record of each vital sign measurement or medication dose. Third, the content is driven by what is billable. Events and diagnoses required for payment are meticulously recorded, which can sometimes lead to biases, such as the over-reporting of conditions that increase reimbursement levels (**upcoding**). Conversely, clinically relevant information that does not impact billing may be omitted [@problem_id:4856391] [@problem_id:4856361].

**Administrative data**, such as health plan enrollment files, serve operational purposes. These files are the definitive source for determining a patient's insurance coverage over time, containing enrollment start and end dates and member attributes. They are crucial for defining study populations and understanding whether the absence of a claim for a given period truly means no healthcare was received (within that payer system) [@problem_id:4856391].

Comparing these to EHR data reveals a fundamental trade-off. Claims data provide a comprehensive view of a patient's encounters across different providers and health systems (as long as they share the same payer), a view that a single health system's EHR cannot offer. However, EHR data provide unparalleled clinical depth and temporal granularity, capturing high-frequency data like vital signs, lab results, and precise medication administration times that are essential for detailed clinical research and decision support but absent from claims [@problem_id:4856391].

### Patient-Generated Health Data: The View from Outside the Clinic

A rapidly growing source of health information is **Patient-Generated Health Data (PGHD)**, defined as health-related data created, recorded, or gathered by or from patients outside of the traditional clinical setting. This includes data from home blood pressure cuffs, glucose monitors, fitness trackers, and mobile health apps.

The distinction between PGHD and clinician-entered EHR data hinges on three axes: control of data capture, sampling design, and device calibration [@problem_id:4856390].

1.  **Control of Data Capture**: Clinician-entered data is captured within a formal workflow, initiated and controlled by healthcare professionals. In contrast, PGHD is initiated and controlled by the patient. The patient decides when, how, and if to measure and share their data.

2.  **Sampling Design**: Data collection in a clinical setting often follows a **protocol-driven schedule** (e.g., "measure blood pressure at every scheduled visit"). PGHD, on the other hand, follows an **adherence-driven, non-probabilistic sampling** design. Measurements are taken at irregular intervals, dictated by the patient's motivation, schedule, and memory. This can result in a much higher frequency of data (e.g., daily measurements vs. quarterly), but the timing is not random and can be correlated with the very health states being measured.

3.  **Device Calibration**: Clinical devices are typically maintained under rigorous calibration programs traceable to national or international standards (e.g., ISO). This ensures that systematic measurement error, or **bias**, is minimized. We can model a clinical measurement $X_C$ of a true value $T$ as $X_C = T + \epsilon_C$, where the error term $\epsilon_C$ has a distribution with a mean $\mu_C \approx 0$. Consumer-grade devices used for PGHD often lack such traceable calibration. For a PGHD measurement $X_P = T + \epsilon_P$, the bias term $\mu_P$ may be non-zero, and the measurement variance $\sigma_P^2$ may be larger or less stable. This means PGHD may be less accurate and precise than data collected in a clinical setting [@problem_id:4856390].

### Specialized Data Collections for Research and Public Health

Beyond the general-purpose data generated during care and operations, health informatics relies on specialized, curated datasets designed for specific goals, such as research and public health surveillance.

**Clinical registries** are systematic collections of standardized, patient-level data for a population defined by a particular disease, procedure, or medical device. Unlike EHRs, which capture all data from a visit, registries selectively abstract only the data elements relevant to their specific purpose. They often involve significant data curation to ensure quality and completeness. They can be categorized by their inclusion criteria [@problem_id:4856380]:

*   **Disease-based registries** enroll individuals with a specific diagnosis, often identified using ICD codes and confirmed via review of clinical notes. They curate data on treatments, risk factors, and long-term outcomes for that disease.
*   **Procedure-based registries** enroll individuals undergoing a specific procedure, identified via CPT or ICD-PCS codes. They focus on standardizing the collection of operative variables, perioperative complications, and post-procedure outcomes like readmissions or reinterventions.
*   **Device-based registries** track patients who receive a specific medical device, such as a joint implant or a pacemaker. Inclusion is often established using the **Unique Device Identifier (UDI)**. These registries are critical for long-term post-market surveillance of device safety and performance.

**Public health surveillance** systems are designed to monitor the health of a population, detect outbreaks, and guide public health interventions. They also come in several forms [@problem_id:4856385]:

*   **Case-based surveillance** collects detailed reports on individual patients who meet a specific case definition, often including laboratory confirmation. This provides highly specific data but can be slow, as it depends on diagnosis and reporting.
*   **Syndromic surveillance** uses pre-diagnostic data, such as emergency department chief complaints or sales of over-the-counter medications, to detect potential outbreaks earlier. It is more timely but less specific than case-based surveillance, as symptoms like "fever and cough" can have many causes.

Surveillance systems are also classified by their reporting mechanism [@problem_id:4856385]:

*   **Passive surveillance** relies on healthcare providers to initiate and send reports to health departments. It has a lower reporting burden but is often incomplete.
*   **Active surveillance** involves the health department proactively contacting providers to seek out data. This is more resource-intensive but achieves higher completeness. Modern electronic active surveillance may involve health departments directly querying clinical data repositories to find reportable cases.

### The Imperative for Interoperability: Standards and Models

The diversity of health data sources creates a formidable challenge: how to combine and compare data from different systems. The solution lies in **interoperability**—the ability of different information systems to exchange data and use the information that has been exchanged. This requires standardization at multiple levels.

A fundamental motivation for standardization arises from the requirements of longitudinal patient care. To provide coherent care over time, a clinical information system must ensure **semantic invariance** (the same clinical fact is represented the same way, regardless of local labels), **structural independence** (query results are stable and reproducible), and **time-aligned completeness** (all observations can be correctly located in time). These properties necessitate a design that uses a **normalized relational schema** (separating entities like patients, encounters, and observations into distinct tables linked by keys) and, critically, binds clinical observations to concepts from a **controlled terminology** [@problem_id:4856353].

This leads to a toolkit of standards that form the bedrock of modern health informatics [@problem_id:4856369]:

*   **Terminologies and Vocabularies**: These provide standard codes for clinical concepts.
    *   **SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine—Clinical Terms)**: A comprehensive, poly-hierarchical reference terminology for detailed clinical information, such as signs, symptoms, and findings. It is the preferred standard for clinical problem lists.
    *   **ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification)**: A classification system used primarily for billing and statistical morbidity reporting.
    *   **LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes)**: The standard for identifying laboratory tests and clinical observations (e.g., vital signs).
    *   **RxNorm**: A terminology that normalizes medications to a standard clinical drug concept, abstracting away from manufacturer-specific packaging (identified by National Drug Codes, or NDCs).
*   **Unit Standards**: **UCUM (Unified Code for Units of Measure)** provides an unambiguous way to represent the units for quantitative results (e.g., 'mg/dL'), making them safely computable.
*   **Exchange Standards**: These define the "envelope" for sending data. **HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)** is the modern standard, providing a web-based Application Programming Interface (API) to exchange data as discrete, computable "Resources" (e.g., a Patient resource, an Observation resource).

When undertaking large-scale, multi-site research, even these standards may not be enough. Research networks often adopt a **Common Data Model (CDM)**, which is a standardized database schema and set of conventions for representing health data. By transforming their local data into the CDM format, different institutions can run the same analysis code and produce comparable results. Three prominent CDMs illustrate different design philosophies [@problem_id:4856339]:

*   **OMOP CDM (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership)**: Features a person-centric, highly normalized relational schema with domain-specific tables (e.g., `CONDITION_OCCURRENCE`, `DRUG_EXPOSURE`). Its hallmark is a mandatory, robust vocabulary infrastructure that maps all source codes to standard concepts (e.g., from SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm). It preserves provenance by storing both the original source code and the mapped standard concept.
*   **PCORnet CDM (Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network)**: Designed to be simpler and more encounter-centric, with a smaller set of flatter tables. Its vocabulary approach is more flexible, typically storing native source codes along with a "code type" indicator rather than enforcing a single universal mapping.
*   **i2b2 CDM (Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside)**: Implements a classic **star schema** with a central `OBSERVATION_FACT` table containing all clinical facts, surrounded by "dimension" tables (e.g., for patients, concepts, visits). Its strength is a flexible, hierarchical ontology that allows sites to organize concepts (both standard and local) in an intuitive tree structure for cohort discovery.

### Principles of Data Quality and Trustworthiness

Once data are collected and standardized, the final and most crucial step is to critically assess their quality and fitness for a given purpose. This involves understanding their lineage, identifying gaps, and recognizing potential for [systematic bias](@entry_id:167872).

**Data provenance** and **data lineage** are formal concepts for documenting a datum's history. Provenance provides structured information about origins, context, and processing, while lineage refers more specifically to the dependency path of a data item through various transformations. The **W3C PROV model** provides a standard way to represent this, defining **Entities** (data), **Activities** (processes), and **Agents** (people or software). A key distinction is between **workflow-level provenance**, which is a coarse-grained summary of the entire data pipeline (e.g., one dataset was generated from another), and **item-level provenance**, which provides a fine-grained, record-specific history for every single data point, linking it back through each transformation step [@problem_id:4856356].

A ubiquitous data quality challenge is **[missing data](@entry_id:271026)**. The reason data are missing is critically important for analysis. We classify missingness mechanisms based on the relationship between the missingness indicator, $R$, and the data values themselves, $Y$, which are partitioned into observed ($Y_{\text{obs}}$) and missing ($Y_{\text{mis}}$) parts [@problem_id:4856341]:

*   **Missing Completely At Random (MCAR)**: The probability of missingness is unrelated to any data value, observed or missing. Formally, $R \perp Y$. This is a strong and rare assumption, but if true, analysis on the complete cases is unbiased.
*   **Missing At Random (MAR)**: The probability of missingness depends only on the *observed* data, not the [missing data](@entry_id:271026). Formally, $R \perp Y_{\text{mis}} \mid Y_{\text{obs}}$. For example, if older patients are less likely to have a certain lab test, but we have the patients' ages, the missingness is MAR. This is a weaker assumption, and valid analysis is possible using methods like [multiple imputation](@entry_id:177416).
*   **Missing Not At Random (MNAR)**: The probability of missingness depends on the value of the missing data itself. For example, if patients with very high blood sugar are less likely to report their home glucose readings, this is MNAR. This is the most difficult scenario to handle, as the missingness mechanism is non-ignorable.

Finally, even when data are present, they can be biased. In observational health data, three types of **bias** are paramount [@problem_id:4856361]:

*   **Confounding**: Occurs when a variable, the **confounder** ($C$), is a common cause of both the exposure ($X$) and the outcome ($Y^*$). This creates a spurious, non-causal association between $X$ and $Y^*$. For example, if socioeconomic status ($C$) influences both the likelihood of receiving a new drug ($X$) and the risk of a poor health outcome ($Y^*$), any observed association between the drug and the outcome is confounded by socioeconomic status.

*   **Selection Bias**: Occurs when inclusion in the study sample ($S$) is related to both the exposure and the outcome. This can distort the association observed in the sample compared to the true association in the underlying population. A classic form is **collider-stratification bias**, where both $X$ and $Y^*$ cause selection into the study ($X \rightarrow S \leftarrow Y^*$). For instance, in a hospital-based study, if both a specific exposure and a specific disease increase the chance of hospitalization, an artificial association between the exposure and disease may appear among the hospitalized population even if one does not exist in the general population.

*   **Measurement Bias** (or Information Bias): This is a [systematic error](@entry_id:142393) in how data are measured or recorded, such that the measured value ($M$) does not, on average, equal the true value ($Y^*$). Formally, $E[M - Y^*] \neq 0$. An example from the world of PGHD is a wearable heart rate monitor that systematically underestimates true heart rate during vigorous exercise due to motion artifact. This introduces a systematic error into the data that can bias the results of any analysis.

A thorough understanding of these principles—from [data provenance](@entry_id:175012) and standardization to the mechanisms of missingness and bias—is the essential foundation upon which all valid health data science is built.
