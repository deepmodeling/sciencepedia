Preconception records and a visit $4$ weeks prior documented clinical quiescence: $24$-hour urine protein excretion $0.2$ grams per day, anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (anti-dsDNA) antibody at $20$ international units per milliliter with no upward trend over the preceding $3$ months, complement components $C3$ and $C4$ within laboratory reference ranges, and no cutaneous manifestations. Blood pressure has remained stable at $110/70$ millimeters of mercury, with platelets $220 \\times 10^{9}$ per liter, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase within normal limits, and no clinical or laboratory evidence of preeclampsia or hemolysis.\n\nOver the last $10$ days, the following new findings are documented:\n- $24$-hour urine protein excretion increased to $1.2$ grams per day from a baseline of $0.2$ grams per day, confirmed on repeat testing, without hematuria, urinary casts, or pyuria.\n- Anti-dsDNA antibody rose to $80$ international units per milliliter compared to the previously stable value.\n- Complement $C3$ is $0.60$ grams per liter and complement $C4$ is $0.07$ grams per liter, both below the laboratory’s lower limits.\n- A new malar rash consistent with cutaneous lupus is present, without mucosal ulcers or alopecia.\n\nAssume the pregnancy-adapted interpretation of the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index ($SLEDAI$-$2K$) is used, with standard $SLEDAI$-$2K$ item definitions and time window, and that physiologic changes of pregnancy have been reasonably excluded by the clinical context provided.

We will evaluate the four specified domains based on the new findings.\n\n1.  **Proteinuria:** The $SLEDAI$-$2K$ criterion for proteinuria is a value greater than $0.5$ grams per $24$ hours. The patient's $24$-hour urine protein excretion has increased to $1.2$ grams per day. Since $1.2 > 0.5$, this criterion is met.

The patient's anti-dsDNA antibody level rose from a stable $20$ international units per milliliter to $80$ international units per milliliter. This significant increase in the context of a flare implies the new value is above the normal range. Therefore, this criterion is met. The weight for this descriptor is $2$.\n    $$S_{\\text{anti-dsDNA}} = 2$$\n\n3.  **Low Complement:** The $SLEDAI$-$2K$ criterion for 'Low complement' is a low level of either complement component $C3$ or $C4$. The patient's results show a $C3$ of $0.60$ grams per liter and a $C4$ of $0.07$ grams per liter, with both stated to be below the laboratory's lower limits of normal. The presence of either one is sufficient to score this item. The weight for this descriptor is $2$.\n    $$S_{\\text{complement}} = 2$$\n\n4.  **Rash:** The $SLEDAI$-$2K$ criterion for 'Rash' is the presence of an inflammatory-type rash.

No rounding is required.\n\nThen, justify the dosing strategy by deriving it from first principles, and briefly discuss evidence-based adherence strategies specific to pregnancy (for example, how to stabilize daily intake despite nausea, how to minimize day-to-day dose variability while achieving the computed weekly total, and how to coordinate safety monitoring to maintain therapy continuity).", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of clinical pharmacology and evidence-based medicine for the management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in pregnancy. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data for a quantitative solution, and its objective is clearly defined as an optimization problem. All parameters are realistic and internally consistent.\n\nThe solution process involves three parts: (1) calculating the optimal number of tablets per week by minimizing the deviation from the target dose, (2) justifying this dosing strategy from first principles, and (3) discussing practical adherence and safety considerations.\n\n**1. Calculation of Optimal Weekly Tablet Count**\n\nFirst, we establish the target daily dose of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) base for the patient. The problem specifies a dosing limit of $5\\ \\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$ and a patient body weight of $70\\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\n\nLet $D_{target}$ be the target daily dose in $\\mathrm{mg}$.\nLet $R_{dose}$ be the target dose rate, $R_{dose} = 5\\ \\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$.\nLet $W$ be the patient's actual body weight, $W = 70\\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\n\nThe target daily dose is calculated as:\n$$D_{target} = R_{dose} \\times W = (5\\ \\mathrm{mg/kg/day}) \\times (70\\ \\mathrm{kg}) = 350\\ \\mathrm{mg/day}$$\n\nThe goal is to maintain an average daily dose over a week that is as close as possible to this target. We calculate the target total weekly dose, $D_{weekly\\_target}$.\n$$D_{weekly\\_target} = D_{target} \\times 7\\ \\mathrm{days/week} = (350\\ \\mathrm{mg/day}) \\times (7\\ \\mathrm{days}) = 2450\\ \\mathrm{mg/week}$$\n\nThe available medication is in the form of tablets, each containing $B_{tablet} = 155\\ \\mathrm{mg}$ of HCQ base. The administration is constrained to whole tablets. Let $N$ be the integer number of tablets administered over a $7$-day period.\n\nThe total weekly dose of HCQ base administered, $D_{weekly\\_actual}(N)$, is:\n$$D_{weekly\\_actual}(N) = N \\times B_{tablet} = N \\times 155\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nThe objective is to find the integer $N$ that minimizes the absolute deviation between the actual weekly dose and the target weekly dose. The deviation, $\\Delta(N)$, is given by:\n$$\\Delta(N) = |D_{weekly\\_actual}(N) - D_{weekly\\_target}| = |N \\times 155 - 2450|$$\n\nTo find the optimal integer $N$, we can first find the ideal, non-integer number of tablets, $N_{ideal}$, that would perfectly achieve the target dose.\n$$N_{ideal} = \\frac{D_{weekly\\_target}}{B_{tablet}} = \\frac{2450\\ \\mathrm{mg}}{155\\ \\mathrm{mg/tablet}} \\approx 15.80645\\ \\mathrm{tablets}$$\n\nSince $N$ must be an integer, the optimal value of $N$ must be one of the two integers bracketing $N_{ideal}$, which are $N_1 = \\lfloor N_{ideal} \\rfloor = 15$ and $N_2 = \\lceil N_{ideal} \\rceil = 16$. We evaluate the deviation $\\Delta(N)$ for both integer values.\n\nFor $N_1 = 15$:\n$$D_{weekly\\_actual}(15) = 15 \\times 155 = 2325\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\n$$\\Delta(15) = |2325 - 2450| = 125\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\nThe average daily dose for $N=15$ is $\\frac{2325}{7} \\approx 332.14\\ \\mathrm{mg/day}$.\n\nFor $N_2 = 16$:\n$$D_{weekly\\_actual}(16) = 16 \\times 155 = 2480\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\n$$\\Delta(16) = |2480 - 2450| = 30\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\nThe average daily dose for $N=16$ is $\\frac{2480}{7} \\approx 354.29\\ \\mathrm{mg/day}$.\n\nComparing the deviations, $\\Delta(16) < \\Delta(15)$, since $30 < 125$. Therefore, the integer number of tablets per week that minimizes the absolute deviation from the target dose is $N = 16$.\n\n**2. Justification of Dosing Strategy**\n\nThe derived dosing strategy of $16$ tablets per week is justified by a rigorous, first-principles approach that balances therapeutic goals with practical constraints.\n\n- **Principle of Weight-Based Dosing:** The starting point is the established clinical guideline for minimizing long-term retinal toxicity, which is a dose of HCQ base not exceeding $5\\ \\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$ based on actual body weight. This principle directly yields the target daily dose of $350\\ \\mathrm{mg}$.\n- **Principle of Formulation Equivalence:** Clinical guidelines are based on the active moiety (HCQ base), not the salt form (HCQ sulfate). The calculation correctly converts the available $200\\ \\mathrm{mg}$ sulfate tablet to its $155\\ \\mathrm{mg}$ base equivalent, ensuring the dose aligns with safety data.\n- **Principle of Optimization Under Constraints:** The practical limitation of administering only whole tablets necessitates a departure from the ideal, continuous dose. The chosen strategy is the result of a formal optimization problem: minimizing the absolute error between the achievable discrete dose and the continuous target dose. The selection of $16$ tablets per week is not an arbitrary rounding but the mathematically determined optimal choice.\n- **Principle of Pharmacokinetic Stability:** The long terminal half-life of hydroxychloroquine (approximately $40$ days) results in very stable plasma concentrations. This pharmacokinetic property means that the total weekly dose is the most critical determinant of steady-state drug levels, rather than the precise daily distribution. Therefore, a strategy that achieves the correct weekly total, even with slight day-to-day variation in tablet count, is pharmacologically sound.\n\n**3. Discussion of Evidence-Based Adherence and Safety Strategies in Pregnancy**\n\nTranslating the calculated weekly total of $16$ tablets into a practical, safe, and effective regimen for a pregnant patient requires consideration of adherence and monitoring.\n\n- **Dosing Schedule and Nausea Mitigation:** A weekly total of $16$ tablets cannot be divided evenly over $7$ days. A simple, memorable schedule that minimizes daily dose variability is to take $3$ tablets on two days of the week and $2$ tablets on the other five days (e.g., \"$3$ tablets on Saturday and Sunday, $2$ tablets on weekdays\"). This results in $3 \\times 2 + 2 \\times 5 = 16$ tablets. Hydroxychloroquine can cause gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea, which may be exacerbated by pregnancy-related nausea. Evidence suggests taking the medication with food can mitigate this. For days requiring multiple tablets, the dose can be split (e.g., one tablet in the morning and one or two in the evening) to improve tolerability.\n- **Adherence Strategies:** Adherence to HCQ is critical in pregnancy to prevent lupus flares, which pose risks to both mother and fetus. Evidence-based adherence strategies include patient education on the proven safety and benefits of HCQ in pregnancy, use of pill organizers or smartphone reminders, and creating a simple, repeatable daily routine. The proposed schedule ($3$ tabs on two days, $2$ on five) is simpler to remember than a more complex alternating regimen.\n- **Coordination of Safety Monitoring:** The primary long-term risk of HCQ is retinal toxicity. Current guidelines from the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommend a baseline fundus examination and then annual screening, typically with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and automated visual fields, beginning after $5$ years of use for patients on appropriate doses and without major risk factors. For a pregnant patient, it is crucial to coordinate care between the rheumatologist, obstetrician, and ophthalmologist to ensure that necessary screening does not lead to an unnecessary interruption of this essential therapy. The benefit of continuing HCQ to prevent disease flares during pregnancy far outweighs the very low short-term risk of retinal toxicity.\n\nIn summary, the optimal dosing is $16$ tablets per week. This is best administered as a simple, repeating weekly schedule, supported by strategies to enhance tolerability and adherence, and coordinated with appropriate safety monitoring.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{16}\n$$", "id": "4515434"}, {"introduction": "One of the most high-stakes dilemmas in obstetric medicine is distinguishing an SLE flare from preeclampsia, as their presentations can overlap but their management is drastically different.

The harm of a missed PE diagnosis is much greater than the harm of iatrogenic delivery.\n    -   In Scenario $2$, the ratio is $H_{\\mathrm{F}\\to \\mathrm{PE}}/H_{\\mathrm{PE}\\to \\mathrm{SLE}} = 200/150 = 4/3$. The harm of iatrogenic delivery (at an earlier, more vulnerable GA) now exceeds the harm of a missed PE diagnosis.\n    -   Because the consequence of choosing $\\mathrm{A_{PE}}$ incorrectly ($H_{\\mathrm{F}\\to \\mathrm{PE}}$) has become much larger in Scenario $2$, one must be more certain that the diagnosis is actually preeclampsia before choosing that action. This requires a higher probability $p$, hence the threshold $p_{\\mathrm{th}}$ increases.\n\n### **Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. In Scenario $1$, $p_{\\mathrm{th}} = 0.25$; since $p = 0.40 > 0.25$, choose $\\mathrm{A_{PE}}$. In Scenario $2$, $p_{\\mathrm{th}} \\approx 0.571$; since $p = 0.40 < 0.571$, choose $\\mathrm{A_{SLE}}$. The threshold increases by approximately $0.321$ from Scenario $1$ to Scenario $2$ because the harm of misclassifying an SLE flare as preeclampsia grows relative to the harm of misclassifying preeclampsia as an SLE flare.**\n-   Scenario $1$ threshold ($p_{\\mathrm{th},1} = 0.25$) is correct.\n-   Scenario $1$ decision (choose $\\mathrm{A_{PE}}$) is correct.\n-   Scenario $2$ threshold ($p_{\\mathrm{th},2} \\approx 0.571$) is correct.\n-   Scenario $2$ decision (choose $\\mathrm{A_{SLE}}$) is correct.\n-   The magnitude of the shift ($\\approx 0.321$) is correct.\n-   The explanation for the shift is correct: the threshold rises as $H_{\\mathrm{F}\\to \\mathrm{PE}}$ grows relative to $H_{\\mathrm{PE}\\to \\mathrm{SLE}}$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. In Scenario $1$, $p_{\\mathrm{th}} = 0.75$; since $p = 0.40 < 0.75$, choose $\\mathrm{A_{SLE}}$. In Scenario $2$, $p_{\\mathrm{th}} \\approx 0.429$; since $p = 0.40 < 0.429$, choose $\\mathrm{A_{SLE}}$. The threshold decreases with increasing harm of iatrogenic prematurity because avoiding unnecessary delivery becomes more valuable.**\n-   The threshold calculation for Scenario $1$ is incorrect. $p_{\\mathrm{th},1} = 0.25$, not $0.75$. The value $0.75$ is obtained from $\\frac{120}{120+40}$, which incorrectly uses $H_{\\mathrm{PE}\\to \\mathrm{SLE}}$ in the numerator. This would be the threshold for the probability of an SLE flare, not preeclampsia.\n-   The threshold calculation for Scenario $2$ is incorrect. $p_{\\mathrm{th},2} \\approx 0.571$, not $0.429$. The value $0.429$ is obtained from $\\frac{150}{150+200}$, again using the wrong harm in the numerator.\n-   The statement that the threshold decreases is incorrect; it increases.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In Scenario $1$, $p_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\dfrac{120 - 40}{120 + 40} = 0.5$; since $p = 0.40 < 0.5$, choose $\\mathrm{A_{SLE}}$. In Scenario $2$, $p_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\dfrac{200 - 150}{200 + 150} \\approx 0.143$; since $p = 0.40 > 0.143$, choose $\\mathrm{A_{PE}}$. The threshold falls when the two misclassification harms become more similar.**\n-   The formula used to calculate the threshold, $\\frac{H_{\\mathrm{PE}\\to \\mathrm{SLE}} - H_{\\mathrm{F}\\to \\mathrm{PE}}}{H_{\\mathrm{PE}\\to \\mathrm{SLE}} + H_{\\mathrm{F}\\to \\mathrm{PE}}}$, is not derived from first principles of expected loss and is incorrect for this problem.\n-   The resulting thresholds ($0.5$ and $\\approx 0.143$) are incorrect.\n-   The decisions based on these incorrect thresholds are also incorrect (they are the opposite of the correct decisions).\n-   The statement that the threshold falls is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The threshold probability is invariant across scenarios because it depends only on $p$ and the test’s calibration; therefore, $p_{\\mathrm{th}}$ is unchanged and the optimal action is the same in both scenarios, independent of the misclassification harms.**\n-   This statement is fundamentally flawed. The threshold probability $p_{\\mathrm{th}}$ is a function of the loss function (the harms), not the observed probability $p$. As shown by the derivation, $p_{\\mathrm{th}}$ explicitly depends on $H_{\\mathrm{F}\\to \\mathrm{PE}}$ and $H_{\\mathrm{PE}\\to \\mathrm{SLE}}$.\n-   Since the harms change between Scenario $1$ and Scenario $2$, the threshold must also change. Our calculation confirms this ($0.25$ vs. $\\approx 0.571$).\n-   The optimal action is not the same in both scenarios.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4515511"}]}
