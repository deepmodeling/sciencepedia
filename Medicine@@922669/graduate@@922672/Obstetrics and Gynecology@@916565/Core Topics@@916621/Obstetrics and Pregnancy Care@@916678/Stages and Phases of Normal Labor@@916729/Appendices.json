A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the derivation of the function for remaining cervical length, $L(e)$, its calculation for three specific states, and the determination of the time-averaged length across these states.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for $L(e)$. The problem defines the effacement fraction, $e$, as the proportion of the original length, $L_0$, that has been obliterated. Therefore, the length of the effaced (obliterated) portion of the cervix is the product of the fraction $e$ and the initial length $L_0$.\n$$\n\\text{Effaced Length} = e \\cdot L_0\n$$\nThe problem states that the remaining cervical length, $L(e)$, is equal to the initial length minus the effaced portion.\n$$\nL(e) = L_0 - (\\text{Effaced Length})\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the effaced length, we obtain the function for the remaining cervical length:\n$$\nL(e) = L_0 - e \\cdot L_0\n$$\nFactoring out the initial length $L_0$ gives the final expression for $L(e)$:\n$$\nL(e) = L_0(1 - e)\n$$\nNext, we use this derived expression to compute the remaining cervical length for the three given effacement states, using the initial length $L_0 = 3 \\,\\text{cm}$.\n\nFor the first state, $e_1 = 0.50$:\n$$\nL(e_1) = L(0.50) = 3 \\cdot (1 - 0.50) = 3 \\cdot (0.50) = 1.5 \\,\\text{cm}\n$$\n\nFor the second state, $e_2 = 0.80$:\n$$\nL(e_2) = L(0.80) = 3 \\cdot (1 - 0.80) = 3 \\cdot (0.20) = 0.6 \\,\\text{cm}\n$$\n\nFor the third state, $e_3 = 1.00$:\n$$\nL(e_3) = L(1.00) = 3 \\cdot (1 - 1.00) = 3 \\cdot (0) = 0 \\,\\text{cm}\n$$\nA remaining length of $0 \\,\\text{cm}$ is consistent with $100\\%$ effacement, where the cervix is maximally thinned.\n\nFinally, we determine the time-averaged remaining cervical length, $\\overline{L}$, across these three states. The problem states that the cervix occupies each of these states for an equal duration. When a system occupies a set of discrete states $\\{L_1, L_2, \\dots, L_N\\}$ for equal durations, the time-averaged value is the arithmetic mean of the values in those states. In this case, $N=3$.\n$$\n\\overline{L} = \\frac{L(e_1) + L(e_2) + L(e_3)}{3}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for the remaining lengths:\n$$\n\\overline{L} = \\frac{1.5 + 0.6 + 0}{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\overline{L} = \\frac{2.1}{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\overline{L} = 0.7 \\,\\text{cm}\n$$\nThe time-averaged remaining cervical length across the three specified effacement states is $0.7 \\,\\text{cm}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7}$$", "id": "4512951"}, {"introduction": "The engine of labor is the force generated by uterine contractions, and its quantitative assessment is critical for management.

A clinically standard operationalization is that the active phase begins at cervical dilation of $6$ centimeters.

Therefore, the latent segment spans from $t = 0$ hours to $t = 9$ hours, during which dilation changes from $2$ to $6$ centimeters. The active phase begins at $6$ centimeters, so the active segment spans from $t = 9$ hours to $t = 13$ hours, during which dilation changes from $6$ to $10$ centimeters.\n\nTo quantify progress, we use the fundamental average rate definition.
