During late pregnancy, circulating allopregnanolone is elevated, and it declines rapidly after delivery. Assume a simplified pharmacodynamic model in which receptor occupancy is governed by reversible $1{:}1$ ligand–receptor binding without cooperativity and that the free ligand concentration is approximately equal to the total ligand concentration because the receptor concentration is negligible relative to the ligand concentration.

Let $D$ be the event that a patient has a major depressive episode, and let $D^c$ be the complementary event that the patient does not have a major depressive episode.
